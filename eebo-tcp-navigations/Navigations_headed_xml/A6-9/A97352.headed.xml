<HEAD>TO THE GENTRIE OF GREAT BRITTAINE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is an Argument of worthinesse, to love worth in others, and vertue you know consisteth in action; so that <HI>Gen∣tlemen</HI> should be alwayes doing some worthy deede, or patronizing that which is done. If you therefore con∣sider the worthinesse of the Author or Worke, you will joyne your helping hands to support <HI>Atlas</HI> groaning under the burthen of the world. <HI>Mercator</HI> drew these Descriptions of the Integrall parts of the <HI>World</HI> in <HI>Latine,</HI> but now they are drawne forth in <HI>English</HI> colours, which are but changeable accidents, for the re∣all substance of <HI>Mercators</HI> World remaineth the same in that manner as he fashioned it. But of late with great care, cost, and fidelitie, these Descriptions have beene con∣verted into <HI>English</HI> with new additions and much enlar∣ged, that the benefit thereof might have a larger extent, for <HI>bonum quò communius eo melius,</HI> Good becomes better when it is communicable to all. And besides, seeing per∣sonall travells in these tempestuous times, cannot be at∣tempted with any safety, here you may in the quiet shade of your Studdies travell at home. If therefore a worke that is <HI>Bonum, utile &amp; jucundum,</HI> good, profitable, and pleasant, may deserve your favour, <HI>Hic labor, hoc opus est,</HI> this is it. So that as <HI>Alexander</HI> grieved that there was but one <HI>World</HI> for him to conquer, so you will be sorry that there was but one <HI>World</HI> for <HI>Mercator</HI> to describe. Enjoy therefore that which is both good in it selfe, and was undertaken for your good, and benefit. <HI>Valete.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Preface to the cour∣teous Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat many sollid and urgent reasons did en∣duce them, who among the liberall Disci∣plines which without controversie are very profitable to mans life, doe give the first place to the noble Art of <HI>Geographie,</HI> they shall best know and discerne, who shall con∣sider both the excellencie, and pleasure, as also the incredible profit of this Art. For, as concerning the digni∣tie and excellencie thereof, it doth not intreate of meane matters of small moment, as brute <HI>beasts,</HI> the <HI>fruits</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> pretious <HI>stones, mettalls,</HI> and other workes of nature, the handling whereof no reasonable man will contemne; but it presenteth to our sight the whole Globe of the Earth as it were in a Mirrour or Looking-glasse, and doth shew the beautie and ornaments of the whole Fabricke of the world, and containeth all things in her ample and spacious bosome, and like the vaste Sea, it doth not onely open and lay forth the hidden and remote Jslands, but also all other Countries. To omit the neere affinitie which this noble Science hath with Astronomie, which mounting above the earth doth contemplate the Heavens.</P>
<P>Moreover, if men as often as they heare some relation of this or that Country, of any strange unknowne people, or of any rare and unusuall Creature, or of the continuall burning of the Mountaine <HI>Aetna,</HI> also of divers Jslands lying here and there in the great Oce∣an, and also of Salvage Nations, some whereof goe naked without cloathes, others feede on mans flesh, and the like matters; or doe reade the wonderfull histories of the East and West Jndies, (in which there are many things which doe rather seeme fabulous than
<PB REF="5"/>
true) doe apprehend them with such great admiration, and give such earnest attention thereunto, out of the desire which they have to heare such novelties; how much more may the curious Readers delight in this worke, which, as we said before, doth containe and represent the whole Globe of the Earth, with all the Countries, Kingdomes, Do∣minions, Woods, Mountaines, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, People, Cit∣ties and innumerable Townes thereof, with the Seas flowing about it: all which any one may here view on dry land, without endange∣ring his body or goods; and in this travell his friends shall not be sol∣licitous or take care for him in his absence, or earnestly desire his re∣turne. Besides, in this peregrination or travell he shall want no de∣light that may drive away the tediousnesse of the journey; for while he fixeth his eyes on severall Countries and places, he shall straight way behold the speciall gifts and peculiar excellencie of every Coun∣try, and observe a wonderfull variety therein, which are very delight∣full to the mind, for as the Proverbe saith, A good merry companion is as a Coach upon the way.</P>
<P>But they shall chiefely discerne the great and manifold benefits of this Art of Geography, who in their eye-travell, and viewing of severall Countryes, shall consider the scituation and disposition of Countries, the Customes, observations, lawes, and manners of the In∣habitants, and shall afterwards traffique, and send commodities to severall places, or resolve to study the liberall Arts; seeing no Poet, nor Historian can be well read with profit, nor be conveniently ex∣pounded or declared by any Interpreter or Commentator, without the helpe and knowledge of this most Noble Science. J omit here to mention how absurd and unfit it is, that he who hath no skill nor knowledge in these matters, should give his opinion and judgement in the publicke assembly or councell of the Common-wealth, when consultation is held about the discovery of some unknowne Country, or in time of warre concerning the bounds and confines of any Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>But Princes and Noble men ought chiefely to bestow great paines in studdying this most excellent Art, in regard it may be very use∣full unto them in undertaking journies and voyages when occasion requireth, as also at home for fortifying the Frontiers of their owne Territories, or the directing and conducting of any warlike expedi∣tion. For that irrecoverable dangers have ensued when an army hath beene led through places unknowne both to to the souldiers and
<PB REF="6"/>
Captaine, both <HI>Livy</HI> and many other Historiographers have abun∣dantly testified by cleere and manifest examples.</P>
<P>And moreover, as it is very necessary, profitable and pleasant to know all Countries, Kingdomes, Dominions, and Provinces, with their scituation, disposition, and qualities; so in like manner the severall Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and memorable waters thereof, ought to be considered exactly in these times, when voyages are so fre∣quently made, unto knowne and unknowne Countries, so that not a∣ny one will continually reside at home, and abstaine from making discoveries both by Sea and Land. So that <HI>Polidore Virgils</HI> complaint is now vaine, who in the fifteenth chapter of the third Booke concerning the Invention of Matters, doth condemne mankind of too much rashnesse, and madnesse, in regard he cannot bridle his affections and desires with reason: and though God hath given him the Earth, being a firme and immovable element, abundantly pro∣ducing all things necessary and convenient for mans life, yet he be∣ing not content therewith, hath made a Scrutiny and search into the starres, the heavens, and the vaste Seas. To the same purpose <HI>Ho∣race</HI> sung formerly, in his first Booke, and third <HI>Ode:</HI></P>
<Q><L>He had a heart of Oake or Brasse,</L>
<L>Who did lanch forth a brittle ship, to passe</L>
<L>At first through the rough Seas,</L>
<L>And did not feare, when he set forth</L>
<L>The Affrick wind striving with the North</L>
<L>wind, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><HI>And a little after in the same place:</HI></P>
<Q><L>No sort of death he sure did feare</L>
<L>That saw the Monsters swimming there,</L>
<L>And could behold them with drye eyes</L>
<L>With the swelling Sea and rockes which in it lyes.</L></Q>
<P><HI>And afterward he addeth;</HI></P>
<Q><L>In vaine did God divide the land</L>
<L>from the unsociable Seas,</L>
<L>If impious ships can sayle unto</L>
<L>forbidden Ports when they doe please.</L>
<L>But mankind bold still to adventure</L>
<L>doth on forbidden mischiefe enter &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>And hereunto <HI>Propertius</HI> in his third Booke doth allude, in that Elegie wherein he bewayleth <HI>Petus</HI> his Shipwracke, where he singeth thus:</P>
<Q><PB REF="6"/>
<L>Goe crooked shippes, of death the fatall cause,</L>
<L>Which on himselfe man with his owne hand drawes.</L>
<L>Vnto the earth, wee added have the Seas,</L>
<L>That the miseries of misfortunes may increase.</L></Q>
<P><HI>And a little after:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Nature to ensnare the covetous man,</L>
<L>Doth let him sayle upon the Ocean.</L></Q>
<P>But these reasons are not able to discourage any one, but rather to quicken their industry, greedily to take any occasion to know, view and discover divers Countries both neerehand and remote; partly by undertaking long voyages: and those that cannot conveniently travell, may gather the knowledge of all Countries out of Bookes and exact descriptions. And truely that studdy is irreproveable, so that it ought rather to be accounted laudible, profitable, pleasant and necessary. For <HI>Strabo</HI> in the first Book of his Geography saith right∣ly, that man ought to live on the Sea as well as on the land, and that God made him equally an Inhabitant and Lord thereof. Therefore they deserve great praise, who have laboured in this Art, as <HI>Abra∣ham Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elius, Daniel Cellarius, Anthony Maginus, Paul Merula, Peter Bertius</HI> and others: but especially that most lear∣ned Mathematician <HI>Gerard Mercator,</HI> although he were preven∣ted by death, so that he could not finish his Geographicall worke, in∣tituled <HI>Atlas.</HI> But <HI>Iodocus Hondy</HI> did supply this defect; ad∣ding not onely those Tables which were wanting to make the worke perfect, but also accurate descriptions thereof, by the labour and stud∣dy of <HI>Peter Montane.</HI> This worke we doe publish againe in this new Edition, being accurately reuised, and purged from many grosse errours; and the studious Reader shall finde that the enlargement of this Booke is not to be contemn'd, being set forth with divers ad∣ditions, and some new Tables added, as he may see in the descriptions of <HI>England, Ireland, Spaine, Friesland, Groonland, Vltra∣jectum,</HI> and other Countries, that shall compare this Edition with the former. Therefore Curteous Reader, enjoy these our new la∣bours, favour them, and Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the use of these Tables.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Tolomie</HI> and we in this booke, doe make the Longitude to be a segment of the Aequator, or Aequinoctiall Circle, com∣prehended with the Meridian of that place, and the Meridi∣an of the Fortunate Islands: for from these Islands the beginning of Longitude is taken.</P>
<P>Some doe not begin the Longitude from the Fortunate Islands (which are now called the Canaries) but from the Flandrian Islands, which are now called the <HI>Azores,</HI> because the needle of the compasse doth point there directly toward the North. But the superficies of the Globe contayneth in Longitude 360 degrees.</P>
<P>The Latitude is the Arch or Segment of any place betweene the Aequinoctiall and Parralell which is drawne through the verticall point of the same place, and it is alwayes to the elevation of the Pole.</P>
<P>Latitude is twofold, either Northerne, or Southerne, and there are reckoned from the Aequinoctiall to either Pole 90 degrees of Latitude.</P>
<P>We have noted the degrees of Longitude and Latitude on the sides of all the Tables, and for the most part, the degrees of Lati∣tude on the toppe and bottome, and of Longitude on the right and left hand, except when some Country is to be described that is more extended betweene the South and North.</P>
<P>The severall degrees both of Longitude and Latitude, according to the capacitie of the place, are sometimes divided into 60, some∣times into 10. 6. or 5. parts, which are called minutes, and we have noted the degrees with greater Arithmeticall figures, and the mi∣nutes with lesser for difference sake.</P>
<P>If one would finde out the Longitude and Latitude of any place, where the Meridian Parralells are, by taking with a paire of com∣passes the distance thereof from the side of the Table, and afterward by applying the compasses to the other side. If thou takest the di∣stance from the East side, the compasses being turned from that side to the North side, will shew the degree and minute of Longitude. If thou hast the distance from the North-side, turne thy compasses from thence to the East side, and it will shew the Latitude. But if the Meridians be not Parralells, the Latitude of a place is found in the same manner, but in the Vniversall Tables where the Parralells are circular, the distance of a place being taken from the next side, will shew the same on the East side. But the Longitude is to bee taken with a thred or Ruler, layd upon the place and turned untill it doe point out on the Northerne and Southerne side, the same minute of the same degree, and wheresoever it be, that is the Longitude of the place.</P>

<PB REF="10"/>
<HEAD>How to finde out the distance of degrees or Miles betweene two Citties, or any other Places.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E have added scales of Miles to all the Tables, by which thou mayst easily finde out the distance of all places in this mannner.</P>
<P>Take a paire of Compasses, and open them untill the <HI>2</HI> feete doe touch the extreame points of the places given, then appy them without any alteration to the scale of miles, and the numerall figures noted there∣on will give the distance.</P>
<P>But if the Distance of places doth exceede the length of the Scale, then with thy compasses thou shalt take the length of the Scale, and thou shalt turne the Compasses from one place to another, as farre as the distance of places will permit, and then reckon the miles together. But because the length of miles in all Countryes is unknowne, thou shalt more certainely take the distance of places with thy Compasses, and apply the Compasses without variation to the degrees of Latitude, which will give the true distance, by multiplying them by the Miles of the knowne Country.</P>
<P>But the Miles doe differ much in divers Countries, and therefore I will here insert their difference in the chiefe Countryes.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a common Axiom among those, who are in any wise elevated in the contemplation of the worke of this frame of the world, that God who is the Author thereof, is of an immense power, wisdome, and goodnesse, and it is im∣possible that a man should doubt of his power, who belee∣veth that created of nothing, and that the matter thereof is not eternall. If there be any man, to whom this power and goodnesse of God doth not sufficiently appeare, as not ha∣ving yet considered well the commendable, exquisite, and most wise ornament, and disposition of this Fabricke, let him then diligently enquire with us, so farre as the contemplation of the workeman∣ship it selfe may perswade him, and as farre as is lawfull to know by the Word of God, and the experience of things. For this is the maine scope we ayme at, that in handling Cosmographie, the infinite wisdome of God, and his inexhaust goodnesse, may be knowne, as well by the admirable concordancy of all things to one and the same end of God, as also by his inscrutable providence in the composition, whereby wee may bee continually rapt up to reverence and honour his Majesty, and to em∣brace his rich goodnesse. God grant then, that he will be pleased, to enlighten our darke understandings with his light, and direct our mindes, to the finding out of this true wisdome. It is so then, that this immense goodnesse of God, not able to containe his owne glory in himselfe, by reason of superabundant fecunditie to beget, was willing to create man, to whom hee communicated the same, and having conceived in his wisedome, to invest him a body, such as we see, as his first Creation sheweth him to be, Created and brought forth the world by his Almighty power, and digested it into that order, nature, and proportion, according to that <HI>Idea,</HI> which he from all E∣ternity had conceived, furnished with all parts necessary for the use of man, so crea∣ted. Therefore the cheife end of the workes of God, and his primary intention, was to communicate his glory. The second was the creation of man. The third, the disposition of all things in the world, and the last drift of his intention, was the be∣ginning of the worke. It behoveth him then, that will undertake the description of the world, to beginne at its first <HI>exordium,</HI> who would profitably extend it to Phy∣losophie.</P>
<P>Curious men were wont to aske, first what God did before he Created the world, how and where he was then, when as yet there was neither place, nor time? secondly,
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
why he did not Create the world many Ages before? and wherefore he did not make man so perfect, that he could not fall? to which frivolous and rash questions, he will ea∣sily answer who hath knowledge as farre as the Scriptures and the worke of God tea∣cheth us of the sacred Trinity, and who shall diligently observe the true definitions of time, and place: but this impiety, and wickednesse of men are not worthy the answe∣ring; for it is religion, not to pry further into the hidden secrets and judgements of God, then he hath revealed unto us in his holy Word, and to dispute of things that are out of our element, and before the world was, and of things that are above our reach and capacity, is meere madnesse and folly: seeing they beget onely opinions, not sciences, and therfore can bring no true wisedome along with them: but rather produce strange doctrines, which obscure and darken the truth. Let it suffice us then, to know the truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings, so farre forth, as history and sense reveales them to us, and not according to opinions, whereof there is no science, and in so doing, we shall not erre, if we onely proceed in a right order.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of God, the beginning and Workemaster of all thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, according to the Platonists.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Platonists from the communion of the <HI>Species,</HI> which is di∣scerned in things, and in the order, which appeared in them, have ascended unto that one, who is the first, and the beginning of all things, that is (according as <HI>Paul</HI> saith. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20.) that in be∣holding the disposition, and most adorned harmonie of all things, perceived after some manner in them, the existence of some Pro∣vidence and understanding them to be the worke of some one; have attained so farre, that they were drawne, as well to the me∣ditating of them, as to the affirming their Creation. First of all, in that they make the intellect or Spirit Fabricator of the world, out of this one, and distinguish him entirely from him, and make him another afterwards. Againe, in this, that separating the matter it selfe from all forme, they understand it not to be the generation of any <HI>Idea:</HI> for <HI>Ideas</HI> are species or formes, which can engender nothing but formes, and so
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
consequently must of necessity follow, that they understand it, not to have beene Created, but that it is eternall. The originall of this errour is, because they beleeved the matter was onely susceptible of formes, and that it had no communion with the formes of nature, and therefore have not onely once dreamed, that it was in the seedes of formes, and that the force thereof might be conducted by the worker. Whence they were at length constrained to constitute a certaine perpetuall, and a formall be∣ginning out of the matter. By the same reason, they were induced to set downe one selfe-same out of one, and diverse from him, so cutting too neere the quicke, and spoyling this one, and primary beginning of all things out of this one, begotten of one, but distinct in Essence and propriety of nature, from whom alone as from the Father, first, and immediately depended the first modell of the worke of the world, and of the immediate vertue <HI>formatrix</HI> of things. The traces of which doctrine <HI>Valentine</HI> follow∣ing added other fancies unto it, having found out a meane, whereby one, whom he calleth <HI>Proarch</HI> and <HI>Bythum,</HI> hath proceeded to the generation of the Spirit, and by some generation comming betwixt afterwards. Finally, deducing it to the Creation, aswell of the matter, as of all things, and even mixing therewith this prodigious Philo∣sophie of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> whom his disciples following, taught the same doctrine in ob∣scuring and adulterating the truth in all parts; more then with old wives fables, but seeing the raving of these men, vanished of it selfe, we will rather have respect to the Theology of the Platonists, and to the originall of the world, the which as it hath more appearance of divinity, then all others, and seemeth to come neere to the <HI>Mosaicall</HI> truth: so likewise it may more easily draw us to true and sacred Philosophy. And therefore in propounding a briefe summe thereof, we will oppose against it a true narration of things drawne as well from the secrets of the holy Scripture, as from nature, confirming the one, by solid reasons, and rejecting the other wherein it stray∣eth from the truth; to the end that under the colour of a more divine Theologie, the eyes of understanding be not dazled in the search of this philosophy, wherein much falsitie is contained. That it may also appeare to all men, that among the <HI>Ethnicks,</HI> there was never Schoole so holy, no care so fervent, no wit so excellent, that by their owne industrie could attaine unto the truth of things; considering also the most Religious a∣mong them, even the Platonists themselves wandred astray, and ministred matter of er∣ring to others. Wherfore let us give thankes unto God alone, who is the beginning, the Creatour, the Animatour, the Conservatour, and the end of the worke of the world: And that it pleased him by <HI>Moses,</HI> and his other Prophets to reveale unto us the Fa∣bricke of the vniverse, the beginning and fountaine of all Philosophy and of all truth.</P>
<P>This then is the Sum of the Platonists Theologie, they lay downe three beginnings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>One of good. <HI>Simonides</HI> be∣ing asked what God was after three dayes deliberation said, that the longer hee thought what God should be, the lesse he understood him.</P>
<P>And <HI>Plato,</HI> It is hard to finde a God, but to under∣stand him unpossible. <HI>The Spirit.</HI></P></NOTE> in things divine, to wit, one Spirit and Soule which are called in their fables <HI>Coelus, Sa∣turnus</HI> and <HI>Iupiter:</HI> following one another in order. The chiefest whereof is he, whom they make to be their first and Soveraine God. Him they call one, in regard of his most simple essence, and good by reason of his superabundant fruitfulnesse to engender, and facility to communicate himself: they describe him to be, neither being, nor essence, nei∣ther intellect, nor good, adjectively: neither to understand no not himselfe, neither to live nor to move, but to be above all these things, that is, the beginning and originall of being, and essence of intellect, and of intelligence, of life, and of motion, and the first and supreme of all things, that may be apprehended, beside himself. Again, that he hath no∣thing in himselfe, that he differeth from all things, that he consisteth in himselfe, and cannot be mixed with things sequent, and yet neverthelesse that he is present in all things, and that he containeth all things, and in like manner he is every where and yet no where, that is to say, he hath no neede of any place, neither is he finite, nor determi∣ned, neither within, nor without, but is the power of all things: yea the greatest power of all powers, and yet is not all things, but above all things.</P>
<P>That this one or good, produceth from his owne abundance, not by consent of any cogitation, not by any counsell, not by any determinate will, not being moved by any meanes, but abiding in his owne habitude, by his owne peculiar perfection, accom∣panyed by a potentiall act, or an efficacious power, internally hee created a beame, which hee dispearseth almost like the Sunne, that abiding one and the same immove∣able, spreadeth its light, which beame in asmuch that on a sudden, it is made that which it is, abiding in him, it becommeth a being, but in that it is converted naturally to the Parent, whence it received its motion, it is made living, from
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
whom being fortified, and replenished with power, and perfection, is enriched by it selfe, of the same Intelligence, and becommeth a Spirit, and Intellect, and as well in res∣pect to his Father, as to himselfe becomes Intelligent: but in as much as regarding himselfe, and being well acquainted with his owne power (how farre it is extended, as that from whence the vertue, which is the <HI>Genetrix</HI> of all taketh her force) defineth to himselfe his essence, which hitherto was indefinite, and indeterminate, and ma∣keth it explicate, not in applying thereto his Spirit, or in passing it into his understan∣ding, as a man doth in seeking that which he hath not, or desireth to know, that which he is ignorant of: but by a sole and perpetuall Act of his understanding, which never slumbreth. An Internall act, (I say) of his essence, having evermore an eye to his power, and knowing determinately things, which were hidden, without addition of Intel∣ligence, so (I say) he conceiveth in his understanding the <HI>Ideas,</HI> or formative species of all things, which they call intelligible gods, and engendreth them in some sort. Distinguished by a formall reason, but the same in essence, as many existents One. I say not One, and many, but One many, as <HI>Parmenedes</HI> will have it, for the lesse nume∣rous unity, as well in the thought, as in the soule, and as the Intellect is replenished with power received from One: so likewise being full of <HI>Ideas,</HI> or the formes of all things remaine one and the same with them, all beings existing in this, and them true, because they are immutable and eternall, which as <HI>Saturne</HI> suddenly swalloweth them up, as being engendred from him, and in him, suffering them to fall into the matter of things naturall and fraile: but keepeth all things in himselfe, and contai∣neth without dissolution or partition, and possesseth all things in one, being present also to all things, and in all places, and yet neverthelesse is not in them, but they in him, as depending of him, and consisting in him. Now as the intellect is One many, that is one being of himselfe all, and in identity of essence, or an unity impartible, but distinguished in himselfe, according to the parts, abyding together, and inwardly by an alterity, is not partible in sequent being, but remayneth alwayes with it selfe, as one is not distributed into sequents. For it is not dispersed distinctly into many things, according to his internall alteritie, but procreateth one onely, according to the semi∣nall reasons, being already by act, and power many together, to wit, the Soule, where∣of we shall come to speake immediately. They tearme this intellect, the great God, the second God, and besides not any, but All God, from whom as from the primary, and sole all-being, all beings immediately obtaine their essence, and therefore all gods. They call this also the word of God, and an act produced from the same good, and againe the Image of God, because it imitateth the goodnesse of his begetter, with all his strength, by a copious and a fruitefull propriety to engender, which forces see∣ing he receiveth them from his Begetter, are yet so conjoyned to him, that it seemeth onely to be distinguished from him, by a certaine alterity. And <HI>Plato</HI> calleth it <HI>Idea,</HI> because it comprehendeth in its essence the Patterne and sole individuall species of all things. He calleth it both the cause and the maker of the world, inasmuch as being made the first being, it afterward becommeth the Parent of all beings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soule.</NOTE>The generation of this Spirit is the Soule of the world, the third God, no otherwise proceeded from thence, then it from one, for it selfe is the word of the Spirit.

Therefore, the

Soule being so constituted into her essence, that as the one, and the Intellect, the same may also be in every place, and being present to all things, it cannot be otherwise, but it must ordaine all things in this visible world: dispose, vegetate, animate, and conduct every thing as it were in hatching it to its proper being and forme: yet the Spirit abi∣deth, not in it selfe impartible, but in some sort to all bodies, and insinuateth it selfe into them in every place, that is according to the reason of every Species, but not di∣stributed into parts divided by it selfe: for it is both according to its substance, and ac∣cording to all its essence indivisible, and is both together in all places, and things, but worketh diversly, in exercising its forces by the seminall and specificall reasons, which are many, and make one resemblance, to wit, of Species in things of it selfe, and therefore though that in its essence it becommeth divisible: yet neverthelesse, that is done by a proper necessity of division (for it abideth alwayes wholly in it selfe) but it is because that the bodyes by reason of their divisibilities, cannot receive indivisibility, so that this partition of bodies, is not a passion, or necessity of the Soule.</P>
<P>The Platonists then ascribe to Divine things, these three beginnings in the same manner, as I have declared them. As for the first, they doe not agree, that it is an act of some One (as it ought not to be) or that it hath any action: yet they grant that it is <HI>potentiall,</HI> that is to say, that it hath the power to produce; retayning the simplicity of One. But that the Intellect, is is an act flowing from one. And that the Soule also is an Act from this same intellect, and that both the one, and the other, are differing from him, from whom they proceed. That he also who begetteth is greater, and better then he which is begotten of him: and therefore the intellect is lesse, and worse then the One; but that it is better, and greater then the Soule, and likewise the Soule then the Species, which it produceth. This is the meaning of all the Platonicke-Theologie, against which we will heere oppose that which is more true.</P>

These three have one and the same Deity, omnipotency, vertue, wisdome, goodnesse, will, and may in no wise be called three. Seeing their force, power, and action, is but one in number, as the Sonne teacheth us. <HI>Iohn</HI> the 17. speaking thus of his Father. <HI>All mine are thine, and thine are mine,</HI> be∣sides, <HI>the Father that dwelleth in me he doth the workes, Iohn</HI> 14.10. and <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. <HI>My Fa∣ther worketh hitherto, and I worke also.</HI> It is also most manifest by the sacred Scriptures, that the holy Ghost, the Father, and the Sonne, worke all things.

subsistances, or Persons, but which differ not in essence, neither are divided among themselves, neither by lesser consequents, are worser in order, as the Platonists make him, but all equall in Divinity, Eternity, Power, and efficacy; the Propriety of whose essence is neither lesse nor more then the other, but equally necessary to the Creation of all things. For in every worke three things are necessary in a worker, Power, or beginning of the internall Act, the Conception and the Disposition of the Act, or the Internall worker, and the issue of the Act. Even as in fire, the beginning of the heate, is the nature, or forme of the fire, the act of it, is the internall heate. The Action, or act proceeding is the heate, which commeth out of it. And the Soule is the beginning and motive power, it is the disposition, or will to move, it is finally the motion it selfe. But because that God hath not created the world, either by chance, or through ignorance, searching the meanes how, or wisedome, but with a great deale of Pru∣dence, and wisedome, it cannot be denied, but that from all eternity, he had concei∣ved some certaine determinate modell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creati∣on of the world peculi∣arly belong¦eth to God the Father.</NOTE> and all the Idea's of his workes, to which we give not beginning in the Word, as <HI>Plato</HI> doth, but to the Parent of the world, consi∣dering that whatsoever the Sonne hath, he hath it from his Father, and for this cause we will place the Father first, as the Seminary reason of the world, the Sonne, the force vegetative, the Holy Ghost, the vertue Productive, and animative, the which with him proceeding from the Father, and being shed out by the Sonne, it passeth in∣to a worke. So, the Holy Ghost, which is abounding in the Father, awakeneth this Almighty and inexhaust fountaine of the Eather, and the immense fecundity of the Sonne encites him (as it were) to budde forth, and by the quickning spiration of his holy Spirit, the Father begetteth the world, by a meane and seminall reason, having conceived it, gives it to his Sonne, as he who properly expresseth the Father, from the Sonne already by act the world is brought forth, but by the meanes of the Holy Ghost as being the Chariot, whereby the world spreadeth it selfe, through its parts, and is animated in all things according to the proper Idea of every one of them. Now the Spi∣rit accompanyeth the worke alwayes, and in all things, to the end that that which is conceived by the impregnant activity, and formed by the quickning motion thereof, is also conserved by the same: It accompanies not then all things in such sort, that therefore it is divided into parts, but indivisibly, and in the same manner as the Pla∣tonists call it, the Soule of the world to be present in all things, and is not so severed from them, that it becomes, either the Soule, or the forme of every one, but abideth in himselfe, and in all things present, and divers, and separated from all, hee formeth all things at once by the Power of the Father, by the Act of the Sonne, every one in his essence, and forme, accomplishing by degrees, both the essence, and the matter, accor∣ding to the reason of the modell, and afterwards appropriateth all things, according to the law, conceived of the Father.</P>

And therefore no thing is more sure, then to search out diligently his worke, as it hath beene wrought by this same Authour, and it hath beene left unto us in Writ by his holy Spirit, by the Ministery of <HI>Moses,</HI> faithfull in all his house.

<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
Herein wee will follow the text of <HI>Moses,</HI> considering it particularly, and dili∣gently, according to the gift of grace which I have received from the Lord. In the beginning (saith he) that is, when as yet there was nothing created, and that the di∣vine Majestie, by the counsell, and determinate lawes proposed to begin the Creation. In the first point (I say) and moment of their existence of things, which yet were as nothing, but a beginning onely of things, without any forme, or condition of things, or of existence, even (I say) in the moment of time, he begun to create: and after God created without any prepared matter, by his immense, and incomprehensible power this huge masse, which was without forme, rude, and confused, out of which hee after∣wards drew all the parts and members of the world. In this creation of matter, as al∣so in that which ensueth, three things were necessarie. The fruitfulnesse of the Pater∣nall power, the effectuall and pregnant power of the Word, and the force fructifying, conceiving and quickning of the holy Spirit, for the matter extracted had the beginning of its existence from the power of God, as from a Seminarie reason, by the fructifying vertue of the holy Spirit, both formed it, and brought it into being, even as the fruit in the belly, and being at last hatched by the power of God, quickning, and nourishing, the same, is made manifest. So the onely God Almightie, conceived, formed, and brought forth into the light, out of nothing in the vigour of his triplicitie, and without the assumption of any subject, the matter of all things, which were to be created, not by the operation first of the Father, afterwards of the Word, and finally of the holy Ghost; but all working, and conspiring jointly together inseparably, and uncessantly, among themselves in the unitie of the divine essence. Now this which is said, In the be∣ginning, ought to be so understood, as <HI>Esdras</HI> doth, <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6. saying: <HI>O Lord thou hast spoken from the beginning of thy creature, saying, Let it be made, &amp;c.</HI> Now in that hee saith from the beginning of the Creature, he sheweth sufficiently, that this beginning or originall, ought not to be understood of the Son of God, but of the first moment of the Creation, which is also manifest, as well by the preposition, as by the con∣struction of the words, In the beginning, and Creature, for to joyne this verbe; Thou hast spoken, with that of creature, the thing it selfe contradicteth it: seeing the creature was not yet in being, to which God might speake. Moreover for as much as <HI>Moses</HI> (as I have said) wrote deliberately against the Gentiles, setting downe a beginning to the world. This beginning can be no otherwise understood, then as wee have interpreted it: for if he had said, to have created in his Sonne (which is also true) and meaneth thereby no other thing, whence then can we gather an argu∣ment against the Eternity of the world, or of its matter, seeing the beginning it selfe is eternall. <HI>Moses</HI> speaketh simply of a temporall beginning, and not otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>By the heaven and the earth,</HI> he understandeth not two distinct and different bodies, signified at this day by the names of heaven and earth, for then neither heaven nor earth had their beings, according to their proper forme, but that heaven was made the second day, and the earth last appeared, the third day; the waters being separated, af∣terward the other parts of the world, created of this Primative masse were reduced into order. By the heaven and the earth then, he understandeth figuratively, this first masse without forme, wherof the heaven and earth were formed. <HI>Moses</HI> then had to do with the Gentiles, to whom he testifieth, that the heaven and the earth which we be∣hold had heretofore beene created of God, as he will shew afterward, and useth names and things knowne, the better to leade men to the consideration of their beginning. For <HI>Moses</HI> meaning was, to pull out of all humane understandings, all Rapsodies of Philosophers, and their false doctrine, touching the eternitie of the world, and its mat∣ter, and by this way to submit it to the glory of God, as he silently sheweth in his se∣cond and fourth Chapter. But, he taketh the heaven and the earth figuratively for the matter of them. These Epithites following demand it, <HI>Thohu</HI> and <HI>Bohu,</HI> which hee attributeth to the same masse, created first of all: because it was without forme, vast, void, solitary and vacant, &amp; doth not adjoyne those Epithites to the heaven and earth, but to the earth onely, carrying the Reader by this meanes, from the contemplation of perfect bodies, to their primarie matter, and hereby understandeth, not the earth one∣ly in her forme; but this indigested and deformed Chaos, using neverthelesse the word earth, because it better resembleth the condition of the earth, when he continueth the description of this masse, and calls it <HI>The Hom,</HI> that is to say an <HI>Abisse.</HI> And so by de∣grees constraineth the understanding of a contemplating man; yet being void of all
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
determinate kinde of things, for the contemplation of the first matter of heaven and earth: neverthelesse in this word <HI>Abisse,</HI> he painteth out some certaine kinde of forme, of this primarie matter, to wit, that it was a liquid and fluid matter, and that bottom∣lesse, as that which in all things, was like and equall unto it selfe, as water to water, and clay to clay. Also in the 38. Chapter of <HI>Iob,</HI> verse 38. The first matter is called <HI>Aphar,</HI> that is clay, which God in the beginning reduced to a sollid earth. It is also called by the most ancient Graecian <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is clay, the first matter of all things. And againe, Chaos, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, because it is fusible, by which its first forme was un∣doubtedly made knowne unto them, and to all the world, from the first Hebrew Fa∣thers, and <HI>Moses.</HI> That masse then first of all created of God, was clay, and a fusible matter, not of divers natures, but of one simple and undividuall substance and forme, having in it selfe the seminary vertue of a terrestriall, waterish and a coelestiall forme, and of all things which God was to forme out of this masse.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Ow after that all things were made, all men may easily understand the end, which God proposed touching the Chaos, to wit, that he might divide it, and forme out of it, as many species of things, as he from all eternitie had pecreed to be necessary for the Oeconomy and government of the world, and gave &amp; establish to all things at once, their force and law, that it might abide immoveable to the end for which he ordained all things. But, for as much as hee created all other things for mans use, and subjected them to him, till the time shall come when as hee will transport mankinde into his heavenly mansion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; as <HI>Paul</HI> teacheth us in the 8. of the Romanes. This most wise Architect, created and constituted them to such an order, that by a submissive service and a sweet harmony, they should all be serviceable to man: which harmonie chiefely consisteth herein, that the superior causes rule over the inferior, and that all effects passe the chiefe causes by the meanest and lowest. Afterward also in this, that there is a mutuall inclination in all things, ac∣cording to the consequence of causes and effects and as it were a certaine love, where∣by inferior things respect their superiours, as their Benefactors: and likewise the Su∣periour the Inferiors, as receiving also some benefit from them. And albeit it com∣meth to passe in these two conditions of nature, that there is some contrarietie and strife found in the meaner species of things: Neverthelesse, every one of them agree well together in their order, and have their recourse to the primary cause, as to their center, and yeeld their service, both to God their Ceatour, and to man: So that all things ac∣cording to their proper office, agree together among themselves; but of these things we will speake more at large hereafter. For the present, I will advertise the Reader to observe well and diligently in the creation of things, to wit, that thou maiest know by what order, of what things, and how, and by what meanes God worketh; and so thou shalt learne that which ought to be first in all the government of nature; and that which ought to be last, what the causes of workes are, what the generations of all things are, and also the definition of things and their natures, their simpathies, and antipathies, their differences in strength, and debilitie, their nobilitie, and igno∣bility, what is of durance, and what in corruptible, with many others. For whatso∣ever may be disputed of the nature of things dependeth on their generations and pri∣mary creation. He that can comprehend let him comprehend. There are many things that are very difficult, in the searching of them out: neverthelesse, man by a deepe speculation can reach high, principally, when after having invocated the holy Ghost, his maine end and search be, to glorifie God in his workes. Thou maist here also well observe, the meaning of things naturall, and another order in the worke of nature, than that which the Philosophers have caught, which was impossible for them to con∣ceive
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
by their naturall reason, the beginning of the world, in such sort, as <HI>Moses</HI> hath described them unto us: but let us put our Chariot againe into the right way. The Chaos being created, first it is to be thought upon, how God first of all did dispose thereof. Above all things it is necessary, first of all to assigne it a fixed place, for wee see that the heaviest of all bodies is the earth, to which this masse hath a better resem∣blance than to the heaven. Now had it not bin in a fixed place, it might easily have fallen into an infinite of pieces, the weight alwayes urging the motion. But to the end he may here marke well the beginning of things, let him well observe, that God of the most basest and grosest Element, of the most illfavouredst, and without any forme begin∣neth his creation by little and little, mounting up to the highest, to the noblest, and to the divinest things. Observe likewise, he beginneth with the most solid, and most firme bodies, that the things which ought to be prepared appertaining to the life and perfection of creatures, which are all fraile, and changeable, to the end (I say) that all these things might have a firme subject to which they might be fastened and made firme: he assigned them a place for the earth and the Chaos, to wit, a point in the midst of the void, upon which it rested, and beyond which it is not permitted to move. This is the greatest miracle of all nature, surpassing the capacitie of man, and humane cre∣dence: were it not that the wheeling course of the starres, and the navigations round about the world, did not manifestly witnesse the same for who could beleeve, that so ponderous a weight could subsist hanging in the midst of the Heaven? and yet the truth thereof makes us beleeve it, who is hee that could understand, that so huge and so heavie a masse can subsist, and without any supporter settle it selfe? What man is he that can imagine that it hath a foundation there where it hath no underpropping? Rightly did God then disputing with <HI>Iob,</HI> in the midst of his anguish demand of him, if he understood where he laid the foundations of the earth, he should declare it, <HI>Iob</HI> 38.4. Here is the inscrutable wisedome of God, and his incomparable power, therefore it is not possible for a man to give a sound reason touching this goundwork, but onely the will of God, who followeth the causes &amp; reasons which are hidden in himself, and whom all things must obey. As he willed, so it was done, his will ministers him matter for the framing and forming of all things, his will from one sole body, from one onely forme, fashioneth many of divers formes; from that which is without life, and with∣out any activity, hee produceth it immediatly into force and vegetative vigour, into life, motion, sense and intelligence, and which is more, all things which he created, are so tied, and agree together, by a mutuall love, whereunto all things tend, that hee causeth them by the sole impression of his will, to have a naturall affection, and a cer∣taine inclination to that dutie which is imprinted in them, according to their Creators will, by the harmonious consent of the <HI>Ideas</HI> in the divine thought: So this Chaos, and above all that which is the heaviest in it, to wit, the earth desireth uncessantly the point which is assigned to it in this vacuitie, by an impression from the will of God, and is moved towards him, by a certaine desire in its ponderositie, till that it hath obtained a like resting place on all parts, supporting and sustaining upon it, the other parts of the world, as upon its shoulders. This then is the nature of the earth and so likewise of the Chaos, and the sympathy which it hath with all other creatures, which he subjecteth to all in the seate, which hee hath appointed to it, which is the Center of the world, and being setled firme round about the Center, resteth and bea∣reth up all other things; and seeing it beareth up all other things, and seeing it is most imperfect, it seeks help and blessing from on high, to produce that which it is enjoyned to do. In this point then the Chaos resteth necessarily, because the Lord hath appointed this for its place of repose, &amp; as a bound for the motion of its weight, which bound and limit it cannot nor will not passe; because the Lord hath spoken, it must be so: and this nature, this Sympathy is given to it from the Lord, as a necessary sustentation of all the Species, and individuals, for which reason, <HI>David</HI> saith <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.5. <HI>He hath laid the foundation of the Earth upon Bases, that it should not be mooved for ever.</HI> And <HI>Psal.</HI> 136.6. <HI>O give thankes to him that stretcheth a out the Erth above the Waters.</HI> Now because this Chaos is the mother of all Creatures, not only of the inferiour bodies, but also of the caelestiall, and of all things Created, as we shall heare anon, we ought not to doubt but all the Elements, yea, all the Heavens, up to the very highest, beare the nature of their mother, some more, some lesse, and have some weight for to encline downe∣wards,
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
towards the midst, and exercise their Sympathy, as well towards the Earth, as among themselves, by a certaine cherishing, a gentle touching, and as it were by a feeling. Now experience also teacheth us that the weightiest things, by nature draw more easily, and neerest to the Center of the World, and the seate (I say) of ponderous things: Whence proceedeth a most certaine reason of order in the uni∣verse, that the things which are lightest, and subtilest have the superiour place, and not onely that, but also the Shpaericall figure of the Chaos, and of the whole world, take from hence their Sourse, for seeing the nature of the Chaos was floating, and so altogether, and that all sides of equall vertue and facility, was borne by its weight to this resting place, so that all the extremities were equally distant from the Center, and subsisted from every part of the Center with a like weight: for if the distance hereof had beene unequall from the Center, more weight had laine upon the one side of the Center, than upon the other. Suppose that in this Cube the Center be <HI>a,</HI> the extre∣mities, <HI>b c d e</HI> and that thou beholdest <HI>b</HI> out of <HI>d,</HI> to the Angle <HI>d</HI>

in the middle side, the line <HI>d a</HI> is much longer, than the line <HI>c a</HI> or <HI>e a.</HI> The matter then which should rest upon the Center, ac∣cording to <HI>a b</HI> or <HI>d a</HI> would have much more weight upon it, then that which is according to <HI>c a,</HI> or <HI>e a</HI> the weight then of <HI>d a</HI> wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d beare it downe, and it shoving it forward, it would fall topsie-turvie, upon <HI>c a</HI> and <HI>e a</HI> till it came together into a like weight, that is to say, of alike distance from the Center, the matter being liquid and sleeting. The Chaos then must necessa∣rily consist of an equall weight under the Sphaericall figure, and no figure else could be so convenient for the world, since that the supreame and most perfect bodies, ought to march about the circumference of the Earth, for the helpe of generation by a perpetuall circumvolution. <HI>Iohn de Sacrobosco</HI> &amp; some other Mathematicians, approve best of the Sphaericall figure of the Earth, by some apparent accidents: but it is much more excellent, to demonstrate every thing from the foun∣taine it selfe, and out of the causes (I say) because the sollid science proceedeth by this way. It is cleere then, that the point found out of these things all ready prooved, ought to be called the Center of the world; because of the weight thereof, and the setling place of all ponderous things. Now Physitians call it the lowest of all, and the other the highest, in affirming that the motion towards the middle, is made downward, but from the middle upward, and that rightly, because that ought to be called Supreme, which is most perfect, and which may conferre upon others some more excellent nature, but the lowest is the farthest from off them, as well in place, as in condition,

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the nature and forme of the Chaos, or primary matter.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Oses</HI> sheweth most clearely; that the light which was Created out of the Chaos in the beginning, was the principle of al things made by God, producing out of the same all the workes of the sixe dayes: now his first proposition argueth evidently, that there was nothing Created by God before this matter, otherwise he would not have constituted therein the beginning of the Creation. Seeing then, that all things are made after this manner, and out of it, to search as is requisite the originall of nature, and to con∣stitute the beginnings, according to the truth of naturall philosophy. It is necessary above all things to consider most diligently, what this primary matter was. The hea∣then Philosophers troubled themselves much in the consideration of this matter, they durst not deny, but that it was, and yet would in no wise grant it to be essence, they said it was neither quantity, nor quality, and that it had neither of them in it, and so made it naked of all quality and forme, when they testified it to be as a meere Priva∣tion. And some of them proceeded so farre in their impudency and temerity, as to say, that God laboured to subdue this matter, and to make it subject to formes. What can be said more foolishly, or spoken more villanously against the omnipotency of God? to wit, as if he, who was able to make and to induce formes elsewhere (much more noble then the matter it selfe, as they would have it) could not also Create a a matter, which he himselfe might subject to all the worke? But such is the obscu∣rity and blindenesse of humane understanding, that without the guidance of the word of God, it cannot, as it ought, comprehend and know any thing certainely, of that which is so farre from sense; and which hath its originall Divine: Likewise this is a very great folly, to goe about to measure and search out of their shallow braines, the most deepe mysteries of nature, her primary originall (I say) and the extreame A∣bysse of the counselles and workes of God. Nature her selfe can teach us, that all things were created of a matter, but who dare be so bold, as to obtrude for Oracles, the manner and conditions of that matter, which are no where showne, either by Gods word, or any footestep of nature, yea which are contrary to the manifest Word of God? they spoile the first matter of all forme, and of all condition, and kinde of being, in such sort, that it cannot be said, what way it can subsist in it selfe. But <HI>Moses</HI> calleth it in Expresse words, Earth, Water, and the Deepe, before that the con∣create forme, or any new Species was wrought upon it. And in <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> 3.20, It is called <HI>Aphar,</HI> that is, clay, whence it appeareth, that the same had from the begin∣ning some kind or forme of Earth and Water, and consequently greatnes and weight. But some one may object, that Philosophers to distinguish betweene things considered the matter by it selfe, and likewise the forme by it selfe, to teach more evidently the causes of things depending on qualities and formes, not on the matter, as also the generation or production of the kindes, which is wrought by the accesse of the forme to the matter, which is well said; and we also our selves affirme the qualities, and formes to be active, and begetters of Species, but not the matter voyd of them. But herein they erre grievously in two things, first of all in this, that ascending from the last and most perfect forme to the first of all, which can be imagined, they separate them all equally from the matter, and hold them as accessors, and induced from else∣where, so that at length they leave the matter naked, whereas according to the true production of Species, described by <HI>Moses,</HI> it is not lawfull, to ascend above the de∣finition of the Chaos, signified by <HI>Moses,</HI> for this having beene the first beginning of things, in this all things are finally resolved, according to <HI>Ecclesiastes. Chap.</HI> 3. Whe∣ther could they amount higher paring that, seeing they cannot proove it to be com∣pounded? Secondly, they faile yet more grievously in this, when as they make all formes so estranged from the matter, that they deny it to have in it any seminary ver∣tue,
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
or small note, but will have it to take its primary beginning elsewhere from without the matter, which we impugne, seeing it is manifest out of the generation of the world, and divine testimonies, that the primary matter hath had its owne forme, quality and quantity, and that out of the forme thereof, the formes of o∣ther things did proceed. Moreover, it is most absurd, yea, contrary to the nature of God, to Create something without forme, and without all vertue and quality, as well by reason of his purpose, as by reason of his Majesty; and Omnipotency; of his purpose, because seeing he hath appointed all things for the service of man, to what purpose should an idle mother serve, which neither can doe any thing of her selfe, nor is able to bend the qualities and vertues received, but rather slackens them, for if thou will say, she conferreth something to the qualities received, thou affirmest at once things contradictory. The matter not to be neither quantity nor quality, nor yet to comprehend either as her owne in her bowels, and yet neverthelesse to be endowed with some vertue, as she worketh something. Now in respect of his omnipotency, and Majesty it doth in no wise beseeme God, to create a matter wholly voyd of forme, for seeing that he is a forme forming all formes, a pure light, a pure vertue and effica∣cy, a pure life, and a breathing goodnesse; how can he produce any thing voyd, and dead, who hath directed his maine scope unto life? He who conceived to Create man after his owne Image, how should he beginne a sluggish and dead foundation, and forme man of that then of which nothing can be more unlike, yea, more contrary to, and estranged from God? He who maketh the beginning of such an excellent, and incomparable worke to be so vild, injureth the Almighty, and doth detract from his Majesty and Omnipotency. <HI>Empedocles,</HI> and <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> seeme to have had a better and a righter opinion of the primary matter, whom <HI>Plotinus</HI> reprooveth in his Booke <HI>de Materia, Chap.</HI> 7. For <HI>Empedocles</HI> did not so endlesly pare from the matter, nor de∣nude it of all qualitie, but when he had learned by experience, that all bodies are re∣solved into the Elements, whereof they were composed, and did not find any further resolution, he ceaseth to search out any higher the beginning of the matter, as being ignorant of the first matter, whereof the Elements were produced. Now whereas <HI>Plotin</HI> objecteth against him the corruption of the Elements, it hath no place, because the Elements are not corrupted, but onely the mixtures, by whose putrifaction and resolution the Elements are repurged and restored to their integrity. But <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> comming neerest to the nature of the Chaos affirmed a certaine waterish mixture to be the primary matter, erring indeed in the mixture, but perhaps because the right name did not occurre he would describe it by a similitude the neerest to the thing, be∣ing taught by a most ancient tradition, that the first matter of all was <HI>APHAR</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he added that this same matter, had not onely a passive fitnesse to all things, as o∣thers would have it, that it might receive formes induced from elsewhere, but that it actually (supply not expresly nor potentially) contained in it selfe, or in its owne essence all formes, and all Species, wherein surely he erreth not farre from the truth, as it shall appeare in the progresse, but if we would have the Species to bee formed from the matter, as <HI>Plotin</HI> seemed to say, certainely therein he erred: for the most imperfect cannot produce the most perfect, but it selfe hath neede of one to perfect it. Now for to attaine to the true doctrine of the primary matter, omitting the dreames of the Pagans (I say) briefely, what I thinke ought first to be thought of it, and in the pursuite thereof will proove it out of the Word of God, and the consent of per∣ceptible nature with it: such then is the state of this matter.</P>
<P>The Omnipotent God, Lord of nature, is able onely to Create whatsoever he wil∣leth, whereof <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist gives testimony in the third Chapter of Saint <HI>Mat∣thewes</HI> Gospell, and in the third likewise of Saint <HI>Luke.</HI> That God is able of those stones, to raise up Children unto <HI>Abraham, verse</HI> 9. And who without any subjected matter to worke upon, was able out of nothing to Create this visible world, much more could he then also in a moment, make out of all, all whatsoever he would. Ne∣verthelesse he himselfe, hath followed in Creating a manner, and rule, which hee gave to nature as we shall see anon. Now nature being once ordained, and consti∣tuted by God, doth not all what she willeth, out of all that shee willeth, but she en∣gendreth it out of the matter, which is the neerest to that, which nature proposeth, for such is infinite providence. So she engendreth not out of a stone Corne, but of an
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
earthly and waterish moysture, neither doth she produce fire out of water, but out of oyle, and yet more out of brimstone, A quality then accommodated to things, which are engendred, is required in the matter, and we see by this universall law of nature once constituted by God; that nothing is begot is out of nothing, nor out of a matter affected to the contrary, or improper to generation.</P>
<P>All opperation then of nature, in the matter affected to the contrary and improper, is violent, lesse neverthelesse in the improper, than in the affected to the contrary. Now that, which suffereth force, the operatour being taken away, it returneth to its naturall course, unlesse it be vanquished by an act of longer durance, and by little and little is drawne into the nature of the operator. All generation then in the matter is violent, if we say, that it was without all quality, and naturall affection, whereby it may be enclined to engender. Now the generation, and continuation of the species, their multiplication and their agreement, and sympathy of things among themselves, is necessary as it is said, in the fift Chapter, and as a may see manifestly, through∣out in the Oeconomie of the world: It was requisite then that the matter out of which something was to be engendred, should first have some nature, and condition proper to it selfe, which might be meete to the Species intended,; which ought to be engen∣dred out of it.</P>
<P>This same nature if in some sort, it had not had a roote in the primary matter, out of the Creation, how could it be enclined to that duty, whereunto God had appointed all things, to wit, to serve for the use of man? What sympathy could there ever be of things among themselves? which is so necessary to be knowne and observed by us, that the Holy Ghost, which sustaineth, and directeth all things created to this use (the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaking in the eight Chapter to the <HI>Romanes</HI> describeth it amply) when he sheweth us, the incomparable greatnesse of the glory, which shall be manifested to us by the service of these Creatures, saying. The earnest expectation of the creature wayteth for the manifestation of the Sonnes of God in glory, that is, it doth the duty, which God hath imposed upon it cheerefully, sustayning carefully mankind in this life, with a desire that they might be saved, and be led to God their Creatour▪ And so this service of the Creature saith he is done to many vaine and unprofitable, and neverthe∣lesse it is not subject to this vanity of its owne accord, that is, it is not all one, whether it is serviceable to the good, or to the bad, but asmuch as it is able doth the office which is enjoyned to it, to the glory of God, and the Salvation of man. Neverthe∣lesse, God hath subjected it to this vanity, that it might serve also to the wicked, though in vaine, yet not simply, but by reason of him, who hath subjected the same in hope, if peradventure they might in groping, taste the benignity and benevolence of God, and be converted. And to shew, that it serveth to the wicked unwillingly; adding that it shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious li∣berty of the children of God, after which the whole Creation groaneth, to wit, till Christ our Lord, and nature having finished the last propagation of mankind, shall bring his faithfull ones into the glory of God his Father: thou seest heere most manifestly, how great the Sympathy of all things is betweene them and man which were impos∣sible to be done out of a matter without all forme, or void of any quality or affection. But thou wilt say out of the Philosophy of the Pagans, that God hath since given a forme unto the matter created, out of which thereafter generation and propagation is made. And to what purpose I pray you, hath he made in the second place, and by a se∣cond operation, that which he might have done at the first, and by the first Creation? might he not aswel from the beginning, have given the matter properly qualified, in its owne nature, as afterward to have given the quality, and that by force? Againe, can he which is al forme, vertue, a most perfect, a most mighty, and a most good Act, the begin∣ning it self, and the fountaine of good, procreate something altogether without forme, and most alienate from all manner of affection and action? Now the Lord would create man his chiefe worke, after his owne Image, for otherwise how could hee enjoy the glory of God in dissimilitude? Things that are unlike, delight not in things unlike, but abhorre them, it is then requisite for man to have a great similitude with God, as he which ought to participate greately of his glory. But the holy Scripture witnesseth, that the universall glory of God shall be manifested to his Saints, and that we shall be like unto him, because we shall see him as he is, the greatest similitude then, betweene
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
man and God, shall be in the life to come, the beginnings of which excellency he hath received in the Creation, as <HI>Moses</HI> testifieth in <HI>Genesis,</HI> as he who from the begin∣ning of his Creation, should converse with God, and serve him in this world in all obedience, untill he were accrued into the similitude, which God concreated with him, and should receive his highest perfection in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that man is Created after the Image of God, and that also the o∣ther Creatures, for having a true sympathy with Man, to whom they ought to be serviceable; have likewise obtained some similitude with God in the Creation it selfe, especially, the primary matter, to wit, the Chaos out of which all things were created; yea man himselfe ought to have some similitude with his Creatour, for it had beene absurd (as I have said before) that God the fountaine of all goodnesse should have created some ill thing, and that he, who is all life, and quickning vertue; should create a stupid body, voyd of all quality or affection, which should be immediately reformed, to the end it might agree, aswell with the Species, which were to be created, as with man. For seeing the worke of every Artisan, sheweth the industry, wisedome, and the study of his Spirit, how much more then the workes of God, re∣present as well his intention, as in some sort his Image. He then, who from the be∣ginning hath thus formed and ordained nature, that shee might bring forth a ge∣neration, no otherwise then from a matter properly qualified, hath also created and produced the first Species of things, out of a Chaos convenient thereunto.</P>
<P>We conclude then, that the Chaos was the first of all things, having in its essence, the seede of all qualities and formes, a nature (I say) simple, and not compounded, deducible and distributive into so many qualities and species, as there is now in univer∣sall nature. Also that it was like to its Creatour in this, that as God the Father is the beginning of all Deity, having all things covertly in himselfe, which are expressed actually in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Father worketh of himselfe by the Son and the holy Ghost, the Word his Sonne from the Father by the holy Ghost, and the holy Ghost from the Father and the Son.</NOTE> Word, his Sonne, and shed abroad by the Holy Ghost, and com∣municated with the Creatures, that so also the Chaos comprehended all the formes of things, substances and qualities, secretly within her bowels, and intrinsicke essence, according to the Seminary and Radicall power, which being by the Creator extracted out of it, perfected and distributed into severall Species, served man by an act of e∣gredient. And as in God the Father, the multitude of Idea's, not as many, but com∣prised under one simple unity, is brought forth from God by the Creation into every Species, so the Chaos being a nature simple, and not composed, is produced, and made perfect by the Creation in so many substances and kindes, as is requisite for the body, and Oeconomie of the world. And like as the substance of God is not com∣pounded, neither consisting of matter or forme, but an indivisible essence, yea in thought, so also the substance of the primary matter, or Chaos, is not compounded, nor consisting of matter and forme, introduced from elsewhere, or a new Created in it, but in a simple essence, Created from one act by a simple being God and a vitall substance and life, or a substantiall forme, or essentiall substance, or in any such sort, that the vnity of the matter and forme may be expressed existing: in this neverthelesse, before other differences the most distant from God, that it is corporeall, and grosse, actually finite in vertue and power, being onely a small beginning of these things, and divisible into different substances, yea even to contraries, not immediately, but by the degrees of generation, which are betwixt both. The ancient Philosophers have not given a sound division of the Primary matter, in having made two beginnings of things diverse, and not communicating, to wit, the matter, and forme. In things which are engendred, such a distinction brings with it some light to the understanding, when as we contemplate the matter out of which something is made, and the forme which it ought to be, introduced: and which as yet doth not exist in the severall parts, accor∣ding as the cause of the thing requireth, but when as we make this in the first matter, and out of the cause of generation, we conceive a matter wholly without forme and voyd, and we wander astray from the true naturall beginnings.</P>
<P>The Chaos is then in things which are created out of God, essence of essences, forme of formes, substance of substances, not by act, but by power, and that not forraigne, but interiour, making the matter and the beginning of the forme, as a mother to all things. But first of all, God is the Worker, then the vertue specificall: ordained by God, in forming them, perfecting and preparing for the birth. Wee shall see then

this opinion of the primary matter, and of the Chaos to be confirmed by the Creation of the World, and the certaine experience of things.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Touching the false and true understanding of the Idea's.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>VT forasmuch as through the sinister understanding and considerations of Idea's and formes, many absurd things are taught by the Philosophers, questions, and intricate disputes are moved, and the true order of the ope∣rations in nature is obscured, it behooveth us to search out more deepely the condition and nature of the Idea's and fermes, that not relying upon a false foundation, we doe not deceive our selves, and instead of true science, consti∣tute so many vaine opinions as foolish dotages. When the Philosophers would that the formes should be brought elsewhere into the matter, they assigne unto them an∣other beginning, and separated from the matter, to wit, a certaine eternall Idea, out of which they flow, and are joyned to the matter, so that every essence is not simple, but one compounded of divers things, and separated, and incommunicable of matter and forme, and therefore the matter and forme had not any similitude in the essence, nor any Sympathy betweene them, before the composition. It is well knowne and u∣suall, that every good workeman, before he beginne his worke, conceiveth a certaine Idea thereof, by the contemplation of which, he beginneth and accomplisheth it, but are many things oftentimes, which present themselves ever and beside the modell con∣ceived, he addeth or taketh from it, and if diverse men shall undertake the same worke in Species, there will be as many differences, as workemasters. There is not then any Idea out of man, which conceiveth and frameth such a modell in his under∣standing, but he himselfe by the clearenesse of his understanding, and according to the knowledge which he hath of things, which are required, be it true, be it false, and according to the judgement of his reason, he imagineth and frameth the accident by experience, or elsewhere he amendeth it, after upon better knowledge. So God as by himselfe, being the most wise, most mighty, and the most skillfull Architect of the world, hath created all things no otherwise, than by a most good and exquisite rea∣son. It is necessary therefore, that he of himselfe from all eternity had conceived an Idea most requisite for his worke; for it is not the property of a wise man, to make a∣ny thing without good order, manner and reason, for the things which are so made, are either made casually or rashly, and cannot promise a certaine good issue. But he tooke not this Idea, for the framing of his worke, out of a fore knowledge of things with a foreknowne rationation, and meditation as from a certaine modell after the manner of men, seeing he of himselfe, and without any motion of understanding, al∣teration, inspection, and auscultation, is all wise, Almighty, having in the vertue of his essence represented before his view, and pondered all the beginnings of things, the meanes, ends, manners, conditions, number, proportions, habitudes, and all what∣soever should appeare visible, a workemaster (I say) so perfect from the most inter∣nall Center, and fountaine of his essence, hath this increated Idea, shining forth in all things, and possessed it eternally; and this Idea is one, and simple, as the essence of God is one and simple, but proceeding by fruitfulnesse, as from the generation and propagation into branches and all formes and Species, according to the intention and scope of the Creation in the alone species of man. Therefore whensoever thou art desirous, to contemplate inwardly, the creation of things, and art willing to search out well their affinity and Sympathy, it is requisite for thee to contemplate the same, with all the subtilty, and force of thy understanding, by what order every thing is created, and whereof, and in what manner the one species exceedeth the other, for from thence the Creatures are knowne, and the order of subjection of every one of them, as farre, as may concerne man. It is now in no wise lawfull to place this Idea
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
out of the substance and essence of God, for it is most properly proper to God him∣selfe, and communicable to no other but to God onely, as his essence agreeth to no o∣ther, then to God: neverthelesse we desire with some, to make fooles of our selves, who have dreamed that all things have beene ingendred out of the essence of God, and are as parcels of him, and for this cause that the Soules of all returne againe unto him. Seeing therefore that this Idea, is inseparable from the essence of God, it is not law∣full for any man to thinke of any primary beginning of formes and species but in God. Now if any one should place the Idea's out of God, they should not be the primary, but secundary Idea's, created of the primary which is in God, the which when they are placed by the Philosophers out of things, and are said to enter into the matter, and to constitute things themselves, and the species compounded, what is that else, but to adde a helpe to the Creatour, which formeth all things, sufficient for all things? as if he himselfe had not beene able to doe that immediately, or at least, that he vouchsafed not, who is enflamed with such a great love to his worke, and that hee delighteth to be with the Sonnes of men. And if we grant him, who is all vertue, and a pregnant efficacy, and Almighty for most noble effects, to have created a matter without forme, idle and wholly imperfect, and of no quality of it selfe, why should we say it is created of formes, more worthy and noble than the matter, by strange and ministred Idea's? were not that to diminish the glory of the Creatour? or wilt thou that the matter be created by secondary Idea's? What Idea I pray can be fained from that which is nothing, and bereft of all essence? For (they forsooth) would have the Ideas to be effectives of formes. Now if any man should affirme these Idea's to be made, not onely in respect of the first Creatour of things, but for the perpetuall propagation of the Species, what difference then would there be, betweene the propagation, and the primary constitution of the thing? The Species, should it not be wholy compounded, the forme being induced into the matter? So then, God hath created the first man, and the same worke of the Creation is consequently renewed in every man; how is it said, that the Lord rested the seaventh day, and afterwards to create? <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. <HI>verse</HI> 2. As those who have beene cast out of the assembly of the faithfull, for Heretickes, who did affirme that the Angels were worldly Creatures, no lesse should such bee, who affirme the Idea's are placed out of God, to constitute the Species of things. For such Idea's are also Creatures, no lesse than the Angels: to this may bee added that which I have said before, that if thou dost constitute the Species, and the matter sepa∣rated, and incommunicating (as it is necessary when thou makest the matter to bee wholly without forme, and that the same joyned with the forme, yeeldeth a com∣pound not simple) it cannot be, that there is any inclination of the matter to the forme or appetite, or any Sympathy whatsoever, rising out of the different similitude. Many frivilous questions, and altogether, unprofitable, are sprunge out of these Idea's sepa∣rated from God, and from things, the which in what manner soever thou resolvest them, yet shalt thou never attaine unto the truth of the Creation, and Generation, and therefore canst not affirme any thing certaine, neither of the beginning of nature, nor of the end and Sympathy.</P>
<P>We say then, that there is an universall Idea, residing essentially in God, which is the totall reason of all the things, which God was willing to Create, disposed and de∣stinated, according to his infinite wisedome and will, and that this Idea is expressed by an eternall act, especially in the framing of the world, and that the species are mul∣tiplied and increased, into many individuals, without any Idea, co-operating out of God; in this act of every species, there is imprinted the character of the Idea of this species, existing in God, out of which impression, it is afterward enclined to the pro∣pagation of its species. We call also this Idea, or reason of all things, to wit, an in∣ternall act from the essence of God, to have proportion to the same essence: there∣fore the Creatures which are Images of the same Idea, are said to have some Analo∣gie to the Substance and essence of God. From whence the most high mysteries of the Trinity, shine a loose off as through a grate, and the Catholike Doctrines may be il∣lustrated excellently, against all the heresies of Trinity, and may in some manner be made more cleare, these obscurities being dissipated: and if any one having invocated the Holy Ghost, search with all his might and a pious zeale, the Analogie of the Crea∣ture to the Creatour. But seeing the particular reasons are excited in this universall
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Idea, by the ligament of a mutuall dependency, and perpetuall harmony, in a most con∣sonant melody: it is necessary also that the reasons creaturall assemble together after some manner in a Symphonie by a similitude, but not proportion, because there is no proportion betweene that which is finite, and that which is infinite. Out of this Sym∣phony also of the Creatures, or the consent and concordance of nature and office, fol∣loweth a Sympathy, the which is necessary, because of the end of the Creation. The things which hitherto have beene spoken of, partly in generall, and also partly de∣monstrated touching the matter and forme of the species, ministry, and Sympathy, shine forth more cleerely, and shall be proved in the history of the Creation. Let us now then come to speake of them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the time of the beginning of the Creation.</HI> The first Day.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen as the Lord beganne to Create the Starres, and their motion was not yet in being, and consequently, as yet there was no time, according to the Philosophers definition; neverthelesse in this darkesome space, which proceeded or went before the light, is accounted for a part of this day, and is called night and evening: <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.5. and constituted with the light following, unto its setting, a naturall day, equall to them that followed. This eternall space then is measured by God, by the first, and last, according to the greatnesse of the parts, and there is no difference, with the time of the Physitians, saving that it cannot be measured, but by the comparison of measure, borrowed out of the Creation; for this eternity going before the world, had neither as yet yeares, moneths, or dayes, or any such like accident whereby it might be measured. And if the time of the Physitians cannot be measured, shall it therefore cease to be time? for the measuring of a time is an accident belonging to time, it cannot be defined. What∣soever is knowne to be, hath its definition in the nature of it, though it cannot be ex∣pressed by words. So eternity is truely knowne to be, because common understanding sheweth it: considering, there is not any man confesseth that to be, which never was, and that which is, sometimes not to be, and therefore that which is, there is no doubt, but that sometime, or in some time it was, and this is a common opinion, that that which was in no time, and which is no part, that that is not at al. For it is impossible to conceive the essence of any thing, without the circumstance of time and place. There∣fore for the shunning of ambitious and captious tearmes, and many vaine imaginati∣ons, drawne from the definition of time and place, although at this day in use, and whereby deceiveable Sophisters obscure the understanding, as it were with a thicke mist, it is better to apply the spirit to the substances themselves of time and place, or if thou wilt may rather be called essence, and if ye cannot expresse their reasons, be∣cause expresse words are wanting, neverthelesse to contemplate them, after some con∣ceived simile. So thou maist imagine time to be a certaine extention of durance, be∣tweene the first, and the last, which after the Creation of the World, is exquisitely measured, by the constant and immoveable motions of the starres, and though there were no such measurings before the Creation of the World, yet it ceased not to have time in it, and if any speculation requireth the measuring, we will apply by this our thought the measures of this our time, touching the extension to the eternall parts thereof. As we would in some sort declare the eternity of God, we may say it was a thousand Ages (I speake of so great an extension) before the Creation of the World, and besides them, a thousand more also, and a thousand besides, and so foreward with∣ous end. And so a common understanding may in some sort measure the parts of eter∣nity, and what neede have we here of any subtile Tergiversations, and Labyrinths?
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Things which are eternall and uncreated, are easily conceived by some such like con∣ception, when they are not defined or well described. And the Word of God ascri∣beth often to him, eternall and infinite ages, from the first, to the last, accommoda∣ting it to the common capacity, which he likewise hath formed. Wee may also suppose the place to be a certaine space, wherein the thing is, which we will divide into three species, into that which exceedeth the comprehension, into the equall, and into the lesser, not determining of any thing touching the greatnesse of the compre∣hension. According to the first, man is in a house; for the second, every body is in the water, or aire, comprehending on all sides the extremities: according to the third, every thing, and God principally is also in the very least place: the Creature accor∣ding to the figure <HI>Synecdoche,</HI> but God according to his whole essence. If any one, these things being thus determined, should doubt that something was ordained eter∣nally besides God, he must consider, that time and place are brought in God, yea from his essence, considering that essence cannot be without time and place. For God (as <HI>Iohn Damascene</HI> speaketh excellently. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 10.) is place of himselfe. In the like manner, and by the same reason may one imagine, that he is also time him∣selfe. And <HI>Tertullian</HI> against <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axea</HI> writeth thus: God, before all things were Created, was alone himselfe to himselfe, and the World, and place and all, Page 675, if he searcheth any other substance of time and place, hee will be swallowed up into a bottomelesse pit inscrutable, and goe astray into obscure speeches, because the depth of God surmounteth exceedingly all understanding.</P>
<Q><L>Before all time, matter, forme and place</L>
<L>God all in all, and all in God it was.</L></Q>
<P>Let us say then with <HI>Moses</HI> verse the fifth, that the beginning of the Creation, and first naturall day, was made by night, and that the night is the first part of the day, and that we ought to beginne the time of the world, from the first motion of the Creation, and that God therefore hath not onely ordained a weeke of dayes, as a memoriall of the Creation, but hee would also have us, that wee should take like∣wise the beginning of every day, from the setting of the Sunne, and from the even∣ing, and that those judge amisse, who would have that the ancient Hebrewes did beginne the day, from the rising of the Sunne, perswading them thereunto by some passages of the holy Scripture, misunderstood and perverted in <HI>Exodus, chap.</HI> 12.18. The solemnity of the passeover is commanded to be celebrated for seaven dayes, the beginning, and the end whereof is appointed in the evening. And the Lord ordai∣ned the first and the last day solemne <HI>ver.</HI> 16. So that the first of <HI>Iohn,</HI> the 19. <HI>ver.</HI> 31, it is called the High Sabbath, and the Hebrewes call <HI>Parasceve,</HI> that is, the pre∣paration, the fourteenth day of the moneth, in which the Lambe was sacrificed, betweene two Evenings, and distinguished from the Passeover immediately follow∣ing, as appeareth. <HI>Matthew</HI> 27.62. <HI>Marke</HI> 15.42. <HI>Luke</HI> 23.54. <HI>Iohn</HI> 19.31. These are then, two dayes, and two evenings following one another. The first is the end of the fourth day, the other after Sunne setting, of the night following, which ap∣pertaineth to the day following. Betweene these two evenings, he commandeth in the sixth verse, that the Lambe should be prepared and slaine, but that could not be done in a moment, dividing the one, and the other day; therefore the evening is taken more largely, for the vespertine time, and enclining to the end of the day, or next ending the day, and following incontinently. So <HI>ver.</HI> the eighteenth, when he commandeth them to eate the unleavened bread, upon the fourteenth day from the evening, he meaneth from the evening ending immediately, the day being shut up. For seeing that the setting of the Sunne, distinguisheth the dayes, as the night in which the paschall Lambe was eaten, and the part of the day before the Sunne-setting, in which they slew the Lambe, may be referred to a day? In <HI>Marke</HI> the sixteenth it ap∣peareth more cleerely, that the night was the beginning of the naturall day. When the Sabbath day was past (saith hee) the women brought sweete oyntments, which was not lawfull for them to doe upon the Sabboth, they did this then on the evening, the Sabbath being ended, because he addeth, that very early in the morning, the first day of the weeke, they came unto the Sepulchre. The Hebrewes then began their na∣turall

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>The Workes of the First Day.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He first thing which God created, was this Chaos, whereof hitherto we have discoursed, to wit, this huge undigested masse, the matter and mother of all things that were to be created, which hee calleth Earth, because it approacheth nearest to the nature and condition ter∣restriall, for the earth was first finished, and brought forth her fruits, and incontinently after, the Chaos being not yet divided, he calleth it waters, not because that then the waters were separated from the earth, but he shew∣eth, that as soone as the water was created, the distinction of the Elements was be∣gun, and therefore before he nameth it Water, hee nameth it Abisse, as some meane thing betweene a masse without forme, and the first distinction beginning to appeare, or rather he gives us to understand, the nature of this masse, that it was <HI>Aphar,</HI> a flee∣ting matter, inclining to the generation of Waters, which he purposed first to separate from the Earth. Now all this masse, how great soever it was, was an Abisse, because that yet it was uniforme, not formed into any species. The living creatures were not yet, the plants, the bright heaven, yea the Elements themselves, the Earth, the Fire, Water, and Aire (but there was saith <HI>Moses</HI>) solitude, vacuitie, or solitary unpro∣fitable, and void, according as we doe call the Earth uninhabited, barren, and produ∣cing nothing for the use of man, Desert. So, this masse was a pure solitude, having neverthelesse in it the speices, from whence all things which are now might be dedu∣ced and formed, which speices is specially understood, under the farme of <HI>Aphar,</HI> of clay, and Abisse.</P>
<P>He addeth that this Chaos had not yet, that which was necessarie for the constitution of nature, generative and procreative of all things, to wit, the life. Two things ought principally to be observed in the creation: First of it all, that it proceede, by the order of things most imperfect, and most ignoble, to the most perfect and most noble, as first of all from the Chaos, to the Earth, then to the water, from thence to the heavens, and so consequently. Secondly, that it institute the nature of all things, their power, acti∣ons, order, the manner of doing, the beginnings and the end, and the periods of either of them, and the universall law of nature, such in the creation, which hee would have to be perpetually. Willing then, that the inferior world, to wit, the Earth, the Wa∣ter, and the Ayre, was the mother of all things, which ought to be engendred, and that the superiour, was the father endowed with masculine vertue, that is willing to ordain a seminarie reason in the Elements, but the prepatartixe, and excitratix to engender power in the heavens, presently after that hee be began to extract the Elements, he extracted withall the matter of the heavens, to the end, that the father, and the mo∣ther might grow up together, that the power, and all the vertue of the one and the o∣ther, might receive engendring, his lawes and rules in the same creation. And there∣fore from the beginning of the distribution of the Chaos, hee ordained two orders of creatures, and proceedeth by little and little in the one and in the other, to the most perfect, and most noble, and then when hee began to distinguish the masse into Ele∣ments, he produceth with the Aire, a Celestiall and lucent matter, of which afterward the Firmament and the Starres were to be formed and collected, and as in perfecting his worke, he divided to every one his speices apart: so also hee gave to all of them the proper lawes of nature, to the Elements Elementary, and to the Coelestiall, matter Coelestiall. It is to be understood neverthelesse, that as well the Elements, of the Aire, as the heaven it selfe, wherein the Stars are, have beene noted afterward in the sacred Scriptures, under one and the same name, as for that then which concerneth the name, which was ordained to them by God, these two were in the beginning of the one,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and the same condition, and were created together, without distinction, but presently began to be separated, to wit, when it was requisite to forme the Firmament, and the Starres of the noblest part of it.</P>
<P>Observe now, what the matter of the Coelestiall substance was. The Element of Water, began now to appeare, and be gathered together in the arch of the Chaos, ere there was there light, which was necessary to the operations of nature. And behold (saith he) the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters, he stirred up a vehe∣ment wind out of the Chaos, to move the Waters, not yet separated from the Earth, and to make them mount up into higher waves, that by this agitation, the Water might begin by little and little to separate it selfe from the most grosse substance of the Earth, and the most subtilest being stirred out of this waterish part of the Chaos, was made Aire, and the more part of the Aeth eriall Aire, or Coelestiall substances. This blast made of these three things, the first day, which without all doubt, made the agi∣tation to endure longer, and it became more forcible, and vehement, a greater abon∣dance of this windie spirit being stirred up, till such time, that at last, the Earth be∣gan to sustaine it selfe, and to gather it selfe more together, it allayed by little and little this agitation, and this windie agitation being somewhat exhaust and consumed, it be∣gan, by degrees to rest. When then thou beholdest the heaven to be extracted, and for∣med of Water, not yet separated, thou maist easily from thence understand, that it hath some affinitie with the Earth, much more with the Water, from whence the Hebrewes call it <HI>Shamaim,</HI> from the word <HI>ESH,</HI> which signifieth Waters, because it is made of waters, and carrieth the Starres about it, as enflamed waters, according to that which <HI>Egibine</HI> writeth, touching the Etymologie of the nowne. But seeing that the Chaos had heavinesse, as well as greatnesse, and whatsoever hath beene made thereof, resembleth in somewise the nature of a mother, the heavier, and the more ignoble, setled together in one, but the lighter and more noble substance, which as it were the fatnesse of all the Chaos, being carried upward, was a long time coupled with the superiour, whence it came to passe that the heaven was created of the more noble part of the one, and of the other Elements, before they were separated every one into his place, hence it is the heavens excell in beautie, noblenesse, and vertue; all the other Elements, as having beene created of the more noble substance of the Chaos, yea likewise in the heaven, the higher things are more excellent than the inferiour: Moreover, the Coelestials have a perpetuall simpathy, affinity, with the Elements, by which they are mutually enclined, the one to the other, likewise also the higher things of the Heaven to the lower of them, in such sort, that there is nothing in the world, which by the simpathie given to it, serveth not in some stead, and order for the use of man; so the Heavens and the Starres, by reason of the inclination, which they have to inferiour things, their forme being round, and resting upon the center of the universe, make their motion circular and divers, that they might communicate their vertues to inferiour things, as much as is necessary for generation. Now this Heaven was yet in the first day, of one and the same nature and condition with the other things, and without any difference, and therefore had onely one sole motion, which distinguished the day and the night.</P>
<P>But as the workmanship of the creation continued, the most lucent matter of the hea∣ven began to be gathered apart, into divers Spheres, and Globes of Starres, and Planets, and as every thing began to grow to perfection, and to have its owne proper nature and motion, so also every one of them, obtained their owne sympathie, and operation. So the light, or most resplendent matter, ordained for the Sun, began immediately to ga∣ther it selfe, into the demy part of heaven, and to enter within the Globe of the Sunne; so that about tenne houres after the creation (for it began to come into the signe <HI>Leo,</HI> as hath beene demonstrated probably in the Chronologie) it gave light to the world, and foureteene houres after, by the daily motion of the heavens it set. This light in the beginning, was also more feeble, and weake, because the matter of the Sunne was as yet dispersed, untill that in the fourth day it was shut up and gathered togethered into its greatnesse. This speculation of the gathering together of the Starres into the Globes, and encreasing of the light cannot be in vaine, considering it was needefull, that there should be light the first day, which made the day, seeing the Sunne was not perfected, till the fourth day: considering also that God had not ordained any other light to make
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
the day, but the Sunnë; likewise we must not thinke, that the Firmament of heaven, the col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection of the Waters, into the matter, the drinesse of the Earth, the producti∣on of hearbs, fruites, and trees, and all things which God commanded to sole nature, having beene made in a moment, as the commandement seemeth to impart, but by degrees and in the same order and manner which hee afterward willed that nature should use, and therefore, that all, and every worke began then to be, when the mat∣ter proper to its nature, was prepared, but principally, on that day in which the com∣mandement was given. So then, the separation of the waters, began the first day, and was finished on the third. For if all things had beene created in a moment, God should have seemed rather to have intended to produce things, then to ordaine the lawes and natures of them. The contrarie whereof we shall see in the third day. It being so then, that every thing ought to be made, with its proper nature, and naturall law, immedi∣ately when every thing began to be created, the efficatious vertue thereof began with∣all, the meane and rule of working, whereby it ought to serve God in his creation; so that all things in their beginning have had in their creation, as their fore-exercises, and by nature once ordained, have served their Creator in the disposition of others. So having made the weight in the Chaos, and the Center and seate of all things be∣ing setled, the disposition and order of things have followed naturally: So the masse being moved by the winde, made naturally the separation of the Earth, and of the Water, and the exhalations ascended upward. The things which were formed of a Coelestiall condition by their Creatour, have also exercised a Coelestiall operation in the generation of hearbes, trees, and living creatures: so the creation went forward, the naturall operation followed it, and these two afterwards concurred in the other workes of God. Seeing then that this is the order of things, wisely ordained, and brought to the scope of the whole intention of the Creatour; the lover of true Philo∣sophie, may diligently observe the order, whereby all things have beene created, what nature of matter, the Creatour gave first of all to them, and what he added to their na∣ture, how farre the speices is extended in forming the things: Moreover to know if the things environing this creation, did give any helpe thereunto, this is not to be de∣spiced, for by how much the more we consider things that are more high, so much the more we shall attaine unto the knowledge of the things created, the efficacie and the communion thereof with other creatures, and consequently its sympathie, and all its operation. Now to the end that the matter of every thing, may be knowne, wee must begin with the first matter which is the Chaos, for as much thereof as may be knowne, according to the forme and qualitie thereof, so much the better also may be knowne the things which are first created of it, and as of them so of all others. As for the rest, what matters are added by the Creatour for the establishing of the speices, and the na∣ture of the thing, this primary nature created cannot teach it, but it must be sought out by the latter, as by the apparent greatnesse of the thing, the weight, lightnesse, firme∣nesse, rarietie, fleeting figure qualitie, colours, office, and such like accidents, and pro∣prieties. The causes efficient whereof neverthelesse, are knowne by long study and experience. I give chiefely of these things, because they are the first foundations (whereunto a Philosopher ought above all to bend his studies,) to finde out the cau∣ses and Oeconomy of things. Let every man doe as he pleaseth, but for our part, wee will follow the parts of the world, its seate, its proportion, and locall motion, and other things appertaining to Geography, the rest we will leave to the cōtemplation of spirits more divine: When <HI>Moses</HI> saith, God said, he doth not shew a sentence given for some peculiar time, but the perpetuall will of him which speaketh and effecteth the things without words or expresse speech, and produceth them in time definite. So also in the actions of God, when he saith, God divided the light from the darkenesse, hee inten∣deth not an externall action, but the perpetuall will of God, whereby alone he begin∣neth and perfecteth all things preordained in time. Now I will not say that in this day; this division was compleate, after which the fourth day, the Sun and all the Stars were finally perfected, but he giveth the wise not obscurely to understand this colle∣ction of light, whereof I have spoken, and that the same proceeded thus farre this day, that the light gathered together in one part of the heaven, might have power to set, leaving behind it the night, and darkenesse. After the workes of this day ended, hee addeth this light to have beene approved, and testified by God for good, which he did
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
not of all Creatures, but of these onely, which above all others bringeth to man an excellent benefit, and illustrateth, and recommendeth excellently, the worke, and the intention of God. So in things following he extolleth with the same praise the drynesse of the Earth, the generations of Hearbes, Trees, and Fruites, the offices of the Sunne, Moone, and the Starres, the waterish living Creatures, after also the terrestrials. All which thinges, man being finally created, he approoved them to be very good, as those which were most convenient for his service, for whose sake they were created. The workes of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. <HI>Psal.</HI> 111. <HI>verse</HI> 2. Light being then brought into the world, the first day was accomplished, which he saith consisteth of the evening, and of the mor∣ning, or of the night and of the day, he calleth it naturall from the Latines. Hee placeth the night before, because that from it the Creation began, for the light could not be created the first of all things, according to the Idea of all things conceived in the understanding of the Workemaster, but the matter was requisite before, out of which it ought to be formed.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the Heaven.</HI> The second Day beginneth.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter the couching of the light, followed the second day, wherein the firmament was Created. But he addeth not out of what matter, God would it should be made: but this is manifest by the Creation of the light. For seeing the light was produced out of the waters, such as we have said, and all light commeth from the firmament, it is certaine that that lucent substance which brought forth the day, and obtained the circular motion, was made this day into the firmament. Whence the firmament in the holy tongue is called <HI>Shamaim,</HI> because it is of the same substance with the light; to wit, waterish, though a little more ignoble. For the light, as being the more no∣ble, required also the more noble part of the same substance, wherefore the species, and nature thereof, was also later perfected; to wit, the fourth day. This firmament <HI>Moses</HI> calleth <HI>RAKIA,</HI> by which word diffusion, extension, expansion, and distensi∣on, are signified. The reason therefore of this name is taken out of the worke of the Creation, which was made in this order, and successe. By and by so soone as the wind fell to blow upon the deepe, it exhaled upward, and the ayrie and celestiall sub∣stance was diffused, wherein whatsoever was proper to light (digested into a lumi∣nous essence) straight begunne to be gathered together, to make up the day: as also the substance of the future firmament, wherein the light was gathered together, and permanent, elevated on high from the element of the ayre; diffused, extended, and displayed, as a saile or tent about the whole inferiour world, and having diurnall mo∣tion, even from the first day, and carrying about with it the light. This firmament therefore by reason of this diffusion, extension, and expansion, is properly called <HI>Rakia,</HI> not for the sollidity, or compact force of the substance, which <HI>Rakia</HI> doth not signifie. Neither doth the matter, whereof this firmament is made, nor that expansion which here <HI>Moses</HI> attributeth to it; and also <HI>Isay.</HI> 42.5. and 40.22. Also <HI>Psalme</HI> 104.22. carry with it necessarily such a solidity, and such a force of substance; nor is to be supposed to carry with it; unlesse some argument thereof in the word of God did cleerely ap∣peare. The comparison taken from a saile spread and extended with the winds, and a tent firmely set up and displayed; doth rather declare the stability, immobility, and incorruptibility of it: such a firmament would God signifie, and have to be, that it might be a perpetuall ayde, and upholder, of fraile and corruptible things. And what profit, I pray you, should be there of the rigidity and force of yron, or hardnesse of
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
the Adamant, where there is no wearing nothing that can corrupt. God also called this firmament, Heaven, or <HI>Shamaim,</HI> that we might understand it to be of the same substance with the light, and together with it to have beene Created. Heere is to bee observed that <HI>Esdras lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. repeating the Creation of the world, saith of this firmament; And on the seaventh day (saith hee) thou createdst the spirit of the firmament, and commandedst it &amp;c. The order of the Creation teacheth, the proportion of ponderous and heavie things teacheth, the rarity of substance and experience teacheth that by how much higher from the Center of the world bodies are distant, they are more rarified, lighter and more spirituall: and there∣fore it necessarily followeth that those things that reside highest of all, are most spiri∣tuall. Now this firmament is much higher than the elements, wherefore it is also much more spirituall than the ayre, and most of all in the extreame sublimity of it, where so many starres have a perpetuall, most constant, and lesse variable motion. Now it was necessary such a Heaven to be made, after that the masculine force, which subsisteth in the spirituall substance, was to be inserted into it: to helpe the imperfect power of engendring of these inferiour things. Neither did it suffice, the substance thereof to be such equally throughout the whole, that is to say, homogeneall, but ac∣cording to the variety and nature of things, a variable and turgent fecundity was al∣so required, which should extend it selfe abroad by a naturall inclination to ripen the fruites, of the inferiour world; and as it were to doe the office of a midwife in hel∣ping them to bring forth. But that fecundity lyeth in the exundant spirituall essence, and fortitude thereof, wherefore there neede to be made a collection of this spirituall substance, which is in every heaven or part thereof, into one body sphericall, as a member genitall. So in the Heaven of the Sunne, the cheife force of the Spirituall substance is collected into the Globe of the Sunne: <HI>Mercury,</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> adjoyned to it for the helpe of generation. So the Moone and the Starres, from the first beginning of the created light, according to the exigence of their office, were collected, every one into their severall Globes: and the fourth day finally perfected. Also the heate and splendour of the light, or rather irradiation was necessary to the act of the gene∣ration of the spirituall vertue, production and intention: wherefore when God crea∣ted the light, he made light also the spirituall substance of heaven. Now if it were possible for any one to know the naturall cause, and originall of light in substance, he should attaine unto a great mistery to enquire after, and in some sort to finde out, the nature of the Starres, which without doubt follow their efficient and materiall cause, for if thou doest apply all the subtilty of thy minde, thou shalt see the creation of things almost follow the naturall order of causes, and from causes to deduce causes, untill it come to the effect proposed. And this is the incomprehensible wisedome of God, that of one first created, he did so forme and institute nature, according to the univer∣sall Idea, that he may be thought no lesse to have imitated, than Created or ordained it. For creating by his will and power the universall Idea of nature, most exactly con∣ceived, he doth also most exactly imitate and expresse, that both in the Idea and Fa∣bricke, the same naturall successe of things, and of causes should appeare.</P>
<P>Oh the most wise, and most powerfull wisedome of God, above all admirable! How great ought the affinity of nature be unto its Creatour! <HI>He spake the word, and it was made,</HI> his will is the essence of it, wherefore as he willeth, so is it, and he willeth it for the same. God willed, and willed with delectation and study, that the Hea∣ven, and every Starre in it, by a variable motion, should serve man, and for man every Creature.</P>
<P>This will, this study, even with a certaine delectation, remaineth imprinted in the Heaven: the Heaven willeth the same, is enclined to the same, and executeth it dili∣gently, with a certaine delectation: the affection of God therefore toward his Crea∣ture, is made the affection of one creature towards another. This is the first and cheife cause, and the originall of all Sympathy, whereby every thing is excited to the exe∣cution of their duty. It is not needefull that we should attribute to the Heaven any other cause, or the Angels to be moovers, as though it were of it selfe immoveable, and dispersed his beames idely and without any affection and Sympathy to inferiour things, wheresoever it hapneth, and much lesse that we should say, that it is perpe∣tually mooved of a divine Spirit, but by a perpetuall nature, according to his will once
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
imprinted in it, yet in the meane time if thou wilt perfect this Philosophy concerning Sympathy, thou must enquire what similitude, what Analogie with the Creatures, and with which of them, he hath given to the Heaven, whereby it is enclined unto them: as also from whence, by what order, and after what manner that similitude and Analogy was inducted into it.</P>
<P>But when thou hast ascended upon this theater, thou wilt cry out, Oh the profun∣dities of the riches, wisedome, and Knowledge of God; how incomprehensible are his Iudgements, and his wayes past finding out! which if thou findest nothing, yet it shall be a great gaine unto thee, to have learned this imperscrutability; to the end thou maist learne more highly to admire the infinite wisedome of God, and with a more ready minde to reverence his Majesty.</P>
<P>This also shalt thou easily gaine, that thou shalt find, there is nothing created of God without cause, and just reason, tending to one scope or end. And now I hope thou understandest what <HI>Esdras</HI> meaneth, when he saith, Thou hast created the Spirit of the Firmament, and commanded it: to wit, that the coelestiall matter, which is most spirituall, perceiving the Word of God, or the impression of his will, doth with him put on the same affection towards man: to wit, that for his cause waxing hot, is extenuated, is made spirituall, doth elevate it selfe on high, above the Ele∣ment of the ayre, extend it selfe, and there remaine fixed; dividing the waters from the waters. Therefore, the celestiall matter, having from the will of God and his impression, obtayned this Sympathy, as yet mixed with the Aire, and turned into a more spirituall essence, by its owne inclination mounted upward; and this is that which he saith. The second day was created the Spirit of the firmament, though as yet there was no contraction of the Starres, and Planets, into Globes. It executed also the rest of the Commandement, to wit, the division out of the same Sympathy, and inclination the same day; and remayneth in the same office, untill the will of God (from the which the Sympathy thereof hath dependance) be accomplished, as witnesseth that of <HI>David Psal.</HI> 148. He hath established them (the celestiall things) to endure perpetually and for ever, he hath given them a statute, and they shall not passe it.</P>
<P>This Firmament was not any particular heaven divided from others, but one ma∣chine of the heavens, as is manifest: for that the fourth day he set the Sunne, Moone, and Starres in this Firmament, comprehending all the Heavens which appeare unto us. But because these bodies which God hath set in the Firmament (and according to the testimony of <HI>David,</HI> established with certaine lawes) are found to have divers motions. It appeareth that this heaven is divided into moe heavens, but how many they are we shall probably discourse in the Astronomicks. But the manner of the divi∣sion appeareth in the precedent, when as perpetually the superour things (as more ex∣tenuated, dilated and lighter) have ascended from the inferiour, as the Water from the Earth, the Aire from the Water, the Firmament from the Aire. So without doubt in the common substance of the Firmament, by little and little such an extenuation being made, discretion and subduction on high: first, in the lowest place was the sphere of the Moone left, and rested. Secondly, the sphere of the Sunne, with <HI>Mer∣cury,</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>Mars,</HI> then <HI>Iupiter;</HI> and there after the rest: in manner that the last separation of the supercelestiall waters, the same remaineth and is the highest part of the machine of the world. The universall and perpetuall nature of things, as is the law of things, heavie and light ordained of God, requireth the Oeconomy of the distribution of the heavens. For seeing that all things are created and formed of the first, and one self matter, and therefore do resemble the naturall disposition thereof, the superiors would be no otherwise affected among themselves, than the inferiors a∣mong themselves: except we will say, that when hee came to forme the Heavens, he did make againe the first matter, and gave it another much differing essence, na∣ture, and law, but this what were it, but to extenuate the wisedome and power of God, as though he had not made the first matter fit for the Creation of all things. This being granted, what communion of natures could there be, between the coelestiall and elementary things? What sympathy? Were not this to disturbe all order of things, and to overthrow Gods scope and intent in his creation? When therefore the universall law of nature doth so comport it selfe through all things, communicating among them∣selves,
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
it can be no doubt to any, but that those things which proceede from one, con∣formable in it selfe, and not discordant obtaine the same reason unto that one, as the Sonne to his Parent, and every thing engendred, to his progenitor expresse in some sort the nature thereof, and be enclined unto him, as to his beginning bound with the bond of love: Therefore there will be the same reason of coelestiall things among themselves, as of Elementaries, seeing that all things were created successively of the same masse, conformable and concordant in it selfe, and the superiours out of their no∣blenesse and perfection, will embrace these inferiours, as their beginnings so much the more strongly, by how much they doe more communicate in nature and serve man to their utmost power. The superiours also being more purified, more distilled, and ex∣coct, having a more noble forme superadded, will be also the more noble instruments of God, unto his scope, and end, and will more strongly performe their office there∣unto. Wherefore in my opinion, that which the Astrologians perswade themselves of the malice of <HI>Saturne,</HI> and of <HI>Mars,</HI> is most absurd, as we shall discourse more at large in the Astrologicks.</P>
<P>The Firmament being created and set in his place, was made (saith <HI>Moses</HI>) from the evening and the morning, the second day, to wit, beginning from the evening as the first, and ending againe at the setting, and couching of the light: The reason of the day is the same as before, the which serving all the time of the Creation, it signifieth, that we ought perpetually to retaine the remembrance of the creation. But hee called this Firmament, Heaven; in Hebrew, <HI>SHAMAIM:</HI> if he called it by a vocall di∣stinction, he so called it for <HI>Adam:</HI> otherwise that which I have said, for God to say, to be: this is the very same as to call; to wit his eternall Will whereby he willed the Firmament to be out of the Waters and made it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the supercelestiall waters, and the Creation of Angels.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F the Supercelestiall waters, there is no where any open mention made, but <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.7. <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>48, and 4. <HI>Esdras</HI> 6.41. Of them the opinions of writers are divers. <HI>Iacobus Zeiglerus</HI> imagineth very foolishly, that the first matter of God was created infinite, least there should be thought any thing to be left without the world void: and that in Creating the world out of that matter, he did not exhaust the infinity thereof, but onely assumed so much as sufficed for the Creation, and left the rest as it was, which he calleth the celestiall waters, void, and darkenesse, which he affirmeth to be excluded from the World, by the Firmament: which opinion is too absurd.</P>
<P>For how can it be admitted that the infinite wisdome of God should create any thing in vaine? For that is done altogether in vaine which is left voyd without the world, and of no forme or use. Which if thou wilt say was done to fill up that <HI>va∣cuum;</HI> I will demand, whether there was any <HI>vacuum</HI> there from Eternity, and whe∣ther also this was not created? It would bring an inextricable Labyrinth of questions, nor any measure, order, and law, in the deduction of the parts of the World, out of the Chaos should appeare, but all things should be done without reason, and without naturall consequence: for there should be no place of extenuating the matter, dilating, and ennobling it. Others, and truely not a few, thinke the Supercelestiall waters, to be the Clouds, which are carryed in the middle region of the Ayre, and that they are separated by the inferiour aire, which is also comprised under the name of Heaven from the Sea and from the Rivers. But hereunto is contrary the holy Testimony of <HI>Moses,</HI> which giveth the division to that Firmament, wherein the Sunne, Moone, and Starres are placed. For the Aire which is under the Clouds, and subject to great mutabilities, cannot be called the Firmament: which if they will call the Firmament, because of the perpetuall and immutable scituation of it in its place, then should the
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
water also be the Firmament, but another firmenesse is required. Such a Firmament was requisite (as I have said) which should subsist immutable in substance and vertue for ever, to sustaine the generation and multiplication of things, according to their Species: but this was made after the light, and therefore after the Aire, for the light could not be without the Aire, which ought to environ the Masse, and to cary the light, and to make the Day and the Night. Wherefore seeing that this Firmament, and perfected one day after it, without doubt it is another different from this inferiour, and more perfect than it, above the which also <HI>David</HI> placeth these waters. Observe (<HI>Psal.</HI> 148. his order in praising of God. First, in generall he citeth celestiall things to praise him: then summoneth all in a just order, and distinctly. First, those that in∣habite the Heavens, to wit, the Angels and the Spirits of the blessed, then the parts of the Heavens: the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, that is to say, the Firmament. Thirdly the Heavens, of heavens, to wit, the Heavens which are the Firmament, and compre∣hend it within themselves: or the Heaven of Heavens, as it is <HI>Psal.</HI> 113. Last of all hee mooveth the waters which be above the Heavens.</P>
<P>Thou seest how he proceedeth in order from the basest, and lowest, to the supremest and highest: adding also a singular and speciall cause wherefore they ought cheifely to praise God: to wit, because God hath established them to endure for ever, and hath given them a law and office which they cannot passe unaccomplished. After the ce∣lestiall things, he passeth to the terrestiall, wherein he comprehendeth the winds, light∣nings, haile, clouds, foules of the Heaven: to wit, all elementary things, thou seest then two orders of praisers: the celestriall and the elementary. Seeing then he pla∣ceth the Super-celestiall waters, among things celestiall, and immutable, we may in no wise beleeve them to be the Clouds. And <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.3. God is said to make con∣tinguate, to touch one another, to lay the beames of his high chambers (that is to say, of the world) among the waters: which can be no other but these waters which are above the heavens.</P>
<P>Now whereof these waters are created, and to what end, it doth not appeare out of <HI>Moses.</HI> For seeing they are not visible, cannot be perceived with the eye, and do not re∣prelent any thing which might be taken of Gentiles, as matter of Idolatry, and further seieng they are the most hidden things, and the highest of the universe Creature, which cannot be searched out by any man, it imported not much to explicate their originall and end, or scope, wherefore also <HI>Moses</HI> concealeth them, and the holy Spirit doth not openly reveale them. Yet doth he not make mention of them in vaine, but of∣fereth to godly minds, matter of conceiving something higher, and intimateth the wisedome of God highly to be admired, and his inexplicable power, where the most sharpe of the understanding is dulled, and is not able to prosecute any further, the wayes and profound depth of them. But the originall and matter of them, from hence may be comprehended, in that he nameth them waters, for he sheweth that they are conformable and co-naturall, of the same nature with the Firmament. As also <HI>David</HI> when (<HI>Psal.</HI> 148.) he attributeth, together with <HI>Moses,</HI> the highest place in all the universe unto them. For seeing all things which hitherto, (after the waters mooved, and light created) were made, by order of extenuation, and of perfection, were carired up on high, and fixed in their place, it may not be doubted, but by the same continued order, it was come to the extreame (as I may so say) distillation, and sub∣limation, in those supercelestiall waters. Then these waters are the most cleare, and pure heaven of all; which the divines rightly call <HI>empyreum,</HI> for seeing there is so great light in the Firmament, and collected out of the same substance of the Firma∣ment, which representeth to the eyes and sense, pure fire, the substance also of this last, and most purified heaven, must be a fire much more noble and resplendant, of an equall clearenesse throughout: as in the which there is made no contraction of the light into Globes, which appeareth to be so made, for that God would terminate the Oeconomie of whole nature, with the connexity of the Firmament, and therefore writeth that division of waters to be committed to the Firmament; to the end that we should understand, that the workes of nature are there terminated, and doe not extend higher than the supreame extremity thereof: to wit, the convexity of the first moveable; but that they are wholly contained within it, and that without that con∣vexity, all things are quiet and immoveable.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26"/>Now for what end this Supercelestiall water, and this most cleare Heaven was created. I will say which to me seemeth probable. That the Angels were created there is no man that doubteth, seeing there is nothing eternall except God onely, all the rest are Creatures, and have a beginning. But when these Angels were created, it is not easy to say. That they were not created before the world, it may be con∣vinced and prooved, for that it is said, in the beginning God Created the Heaven and the Earth, that is to say, that Masse without forme, the mother of heaven and Earth. Now if the Creation did beginne from that Masse, then could not the Angels be first created. Yet when the lucent, and bright Starres were placed in the Firmament, from that time they tooke their being: for so doth the Lord speake to <HI>Iob chap.</HI> 38. <HI>v.</HI> 6. Who laid the corner stone thereof (to wit, of the Earth) when the morning Starres sang together; and all the Sonnes of God shouted for joy.</P>
<P>The Sonnes of God could be no other than the Angels, for man as then was not Created: Now if the Angels sang praises to God the Creatour, then when he esta∣blished the Earth upon the corner stone, and together with them, the bright shining Starres gave praise: therefore the third day the Angels were, and also the Starres were, although as yet imperfect. For the first day in the morning they beganne to be crea∣ted, and the fourth day were perfected, therefore they were much more then halfe perfected, and begunne to shine, the light being extended, and to praise and glorifie God in his service and obedience. But that place in <HI>Iob</HI> 38.6. hath relation to the third day of the Creation, thou mayest easily understand, if thou comparest the two precedent verses. For in the first, he speaketh of the first Foundation of the Earth, that is, when God gave it a place of rest, the Center of the universe: which is the ve∣ry <HI>basis</HI> of the Earth.</P>
<P>Of this foundation speaketh <HI>David, Ps.</HI> 104.5. Saying, thou hast established the Earth upon her Bases, that it should not be mooved for ever. In the other he speaketh of the figure which the Earth hath obtained by its weight, on every side equally affecting the Center; to wit, Sphericall. But in the sixt verse, first, he maketh a most profound question, to wit, how that Center which is the basis of heavy things, should be fixed: seeing it hangeth of the fluent, and moveable Ayre? Immediately after he speaketh of the superstruction which is accustomed to be elevated on high, and presseth chiefely unto the Angles, or corners of the edifices. Who (saith he) hath laid the corner stone, which sustaineth the Masse, ascending up on high? Thou seest three parts of the earth brought in question, to be setled and established, in that order wherein they mutu∣ally succeeded one another in the Creation, For first the Chaos being created, the Earth began to settle into the Center. Secondly, in the setling received a Sphericall figure. Thirdly, the Earth at length becommeth dry, shewed it selfe above the wa∣ters, and was there established, yea, the most high Mountaines thereafter hanging a∣bove the waters. Of which establishment <HI>David</HI> speaketh thus (<HI>Psal,</HI> 24.2.) For he hath founded it upon the Seas, and established it upon the Floods. The sixt verse demandeth in the second part, who hath raised these most high hilly tops, so great a distance above the waters, and so established them, that they fall not, and returne not to their owne naturall place? Seeing therefore the firmenesse and stability of these was made the third day, when the Earth was made dry, solid, and firme, it is alto∣gether manifest, that the Angels were created before this scicity, and firmitude was accomplished: to wit, the second day. And with this agreeth most elegantly, the Creation of the Super-celestiall waters, made the second day: out of which it is very likely the Angels were created. For there was no substance in the whole Creature more fit hereunto, then that cleare and ardent Aire, in the which the Creatour plea∣sed that they should have their seate, and habitation. Neither was there any other element more convenient for their bodies, than from whence they should take their spirit. And <HI>Paul. Heb.</HI> 1. testifieth that the Angels are Spirits, and a flame of fire, that is to say cleare spirits, like the most cleare flame, as is almost the substance in the Empyreall Heaven: So that the Angels seeme to be created of the supercelestiall waters; as the Starres: but animated rationall, and mooving themselves up on high, and downe below for the service of God: whereupon they are called Angels of light, that is to say, light shining Angels, created out of the light, and dwelling in heavenly light, and doe appeare unto men with great clearenesse of light: as to the Shepheards.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE third Day God said, <HI>Let the waters which are under the Heaven be gathered together into one place, and that which is dry appeare. Moses</HI> minded not to say, that finally the third day he said this, and began to separate: but that his eternall will was that this third day, the divi∣sion of the earth and water should be perfected, and the earth be dry∣ed up, and should appeare more high above the waters, having recei∣ved the waters within her bosomes, to be the seate and habitation to all future living creatures, and a storehouse to afford all sustenance: What things soever are in God are eternall: his will of dividing, as well as of creating was from eternity; and also of accomplishing the division, this day was eternall: and it was finished he willed it to be made from eternity, and approoved of it eternally. His sentence standeth fast, whereof he cannot repent, it cannot be redargued, reprooved, amended, nor better conceived, because his wisedome and prudence is infinite, and doth admit no change of counsell and will. Therefore seeing this day the division was compleate: God said, (saith <HI>Moses</HI>) that is to say, from all eternity, that the division should be made, and that which is dry appeare, that is to say, that the divisi∣on should be made untill that which is made should appeare. And when did the dry appeare? even now the third day of the Creation: for he addeth and it was so, to wit, e∣ven now incontinent after the second day, which a little before he said was compleate, and before the end of the third day, which he will conclude after in the third verse.</P>
<P>Now if any one would comprehend together, the division begunne, and perfected in one day, what constitution there was of the order, and law of nature, in the crea∣tion, when as now we see it to worke successively, and by causes, and consequent meanes? It will then necessarily follow, that God hath created all things without any order, and law of nature, and that after he ordayned and gave these things to na∣ture: which were very absurd, and impious to thinke: for things ought to bring with them their nature, and law of working from the Creation, unlesse we should thinke that God in creating wanted either counsell, or was not of power sufficient. When therefore in the second verse he mooved the waters with a strong blast; wee understand that he instituted the naturall cause, in the workes following, and that from the time the Earth was begunne to be separated from the water: but that the third day this separation was perfected, and compleate.</P>
<P>This naturall cause of separation being observed, the cause also of the inequality of the Earth, and of the Gulphes of the Sea may be knowne. For this by this violence of the winde, this <HI>Aphar</HI> created in the beginning, it so came from diverse parts, that it ele∣vated very high, and from hence cellected the low setled earth up aloft, but thereupon made deepe, and great valleyes. Thou wilt thinke then that in that part in the which is now the Atlanticke Sea, a most vehement wind to have fallen upon <HI>Aphar,</HI> and in like maner in that part where now Asia, and new India are divided: &amp; that the same winds have made in the same place vast concavities of the low setled Earth, and have heaped and raised it up on high into the firme lands: also that from hence are raised divers boi∣sterous winds, w<SUP>ch</SUP> have caused the lesser concavities, &amp; the waters being on both sides carried on high, have congested the earth into mountaines, so by the callission, reper∣cussion or beating of the waters one against another, thou maist understand, that the
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>
earth was separated from the Waters, and collected through the middle region into most high mountaines. So through Africa the hill <HI>Atlas,</HI> and the hils of the Moone. By Asia, the Mountaine Imaus, and the Caspian Mountaines, and other Mountaines every where produced. Now the waters after a long agitation being purified from all earth, and collected into those places, resided where the Lord set unto them abound: as <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 103. <HI>ver.</HI> 9. to wit when as all heavie things approach as neare as ever they can to the center of the world, and the water which is fluent, and gliding not able to consist accumulated as the Earth can; it doth alwayes glide downeward to the neather place, untill it come to the very bottome, the plummet, or lead, from whence it cannot ascend againe, unlesse a more heavie thing possesse the bottome. Thereof it commeth, that all waters not being opposed, or stopped by higher barres, doe runne into the sea.</P>
<P>Now here it is to be thought, the Sunne, the Moone, and the other Starres, to be so farre forth collected and compacted together, that in the nature which is given them, they begin to have more vehement forces. For now they encreased unto the third day, in clearenesse of light, and naturall vertue, wherefore it is certaine that it helped much in drying up of the earth. The Wind also in some sort as yet blowing through the aire, drew out of myre and dirt, humors perfectly excocted, and extenuated by the Sunne: that for two causes the earth might be dried up, and grow into a greater solidi∣tie without the which it had remained fluxative, and (relapsed to the deepe places) had, according to its nature, setled under the Waters: to wit, as being more heavie; and therefore forcing them upwards. But wee must understand this siccitie of the earth, not to be absolute, but in mediocritie: so great as sufficed for the establishment of the earth, and creation of Plants. For the hearbes were created before it ever rained, which have neede of moisture, and man was formed of clay the sixth day. But withall consider this, if the earth had beene altogether dry, it could not have beene raised into high mountaines, and remaine firme. For there is a certaine moisture which bindeth the earth, whereof comming to be deprived, yet glideth away as the sand; neither had it beene fit for the engendring of those things, which God would produce in the bowells thereof. Here is also to be observed, how great the wisedome of the Creator was in making hollow these bayes, and channels, as receptacles of the Waters; for so hath he distributed the sea throughout the whole world, that all the kingdomes of the world may have commerce one with another, and what things soe∣ver either nature or art affordeth, may transport whether they will. And (which is most of all) that the Earth, with the Waters collected together, making one sphere, might remaine in one equall ballance: for otherwise the Earth should not be esta∣blished upon the Waters, but the more heavie weight being collected into one part, should presse downe all the masse of the Earth, towards the center of gravitie, and of the world, and that depression of the Earth, having elevated more high, and aloft, the Waters lying on the other part, would have caused them to overflow, and possesse the next adjoyning Ilands. For after that the Earth in the same quantitie is heavier than the Waters, it is necessary that the body of the Earth consist by it selfe in an equall ballance: And also that the Seas environing the orbe of the Earth, and communicating together, should be so distributed, that on every side lying in an equall ballance, they should not bring more weight into one halfe of the sphere, in what circle soever you compasse it, than in another thereunto opposite.</P>
<P>If the Seas did not communicate together, but some remained shut up within their owne bayes and chanels, the Earth could in some sort (although not throughout, and in it selfe) consist equally ballanced. For what weight wanted in one halfe thereof the Waters would supply shut up in it. But seeing the use and office of the Seas, re∣quired a communion of them among themselves, for the necessary circuit of Naviga∣tion: the same also the exoncration and disburthening of Rivers requireth, which by the onely communication of the Seas equally, and according to an equall ballance, may be distributed into all the parts of the Sphere; it was first and chiefely necessary (as I have said) that the Earth should remaine in an equall ballance, neither could that be supplied by the Waters: for they should be raised, and heaped up higher, in the lighter, then in the heavier part: and therefore should flow downe, till they had obtained an equall height on every side from the Center. Now if we grant, that these
<PB N="31" REF="27"/>
waters supplying that equall ballance, are shut in, that they cannot flow out: yet two inconveniences would follow; the one, that being subject to corruption, they would infect those things next unto them, and should not be so usefull for humane things as they ought: the other, that the earth having drawne their substance into her bowels, or being by little and little extracted by exhalation, they should abandon their place, and take away that equality that retaineth the whole, that it cannot budge one way nor o∣ther. Which if any one will maintaine that the Waters may be there conserved, wee will answer that in vaine are employed a great number of meanes (wherein there is more operative labour, and to the rest unprofitable) to doe that which may be done without the same: and indeede both more compendiously, and more profitably. Whereby then the sentence standeth fast, that the machine of the earth is in it selfe e∣qually ballanced without budging one way or other, and consequently also the Sea, which is contained within the bosome of it. And also that the Sea is in continuall mo∣tion, lest it should be corrupted and infect the aire, and kill the fishes. Moreover, it washeth the Earth both within and without, that all things should be cleane and wholesome: all corruption being consumed and dissipated by motion and attrition. The constitution of the weight of the Center, and of the world importeth all these things: which if they had beene knowne, and examined by the ancients, they had judged almost true, that which is of the situation, and greatnesse of the continent of the new land found out in our age: and the Meridionall continent, not yet discovered si∣tuate under the Pole Antarticke. For seeing that the lands knowne to the continent, and comprehended in a hundred eightie degrees of longitude, that is to say, doe onely possesse the one halfe of the Sphere, it was necessary there should be also as much land in the other halfe. And seeing that Asia, Europe, and Africa, for the greater part, are situated beyond the Equinoctiall towards the North, it was necessary as great a conti∣nent to remaine under the Pole Antarticke, which should be equivalent in the other lands, with the meridionall parts of Asia, or new India or America.</P>
<P>God (as saith <HI>Moses</HI>) called the dry land <HI>EREZ,</HI> separated from the Waters, and prepared for the life of living creatures, that is to say, the Earth and the Waters ga∣thered together, <HI>MAIM,</HI> that is the Seas. But it is not to be thought, that so soone as this separation was made, he gave these names no more than before, the names of the day, of the night, and of the heaven. For to whom should hee have told them, when as man (whom it chiefely concerned to know these workes) was not yet crea∣ted? Vnlesse any will maintaine, that they were told to the Angels. But I hold for an assured truth that here is insinuated another, and a very great mysterie, to wit, a testimony of the immense love, and most loving and bountifull conversation of God with man, whom with a singular purpose, and affectionate study he created. For I thinke that this manifestation of names, signified not that present day it was, but after in a familiar conference with <HI>Adam.</HI> For when God brought the creatures to <HI>Adam</HI> that he should give them names, there is no doubt but he had longer speech with him, and treated with him amply of the Creation: naming the light, the day, the night, the heaven, the earth, the sea, the Moone, and principall parts of the world: by meanes whereof hee might leave to his posteritie the true History of all this great worke; as also to be conserved in some measure after <HI>Adam,</HI> even to <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>This word <HI>EREZ</HI> (that I may use the words of <HI>Augustine Eugebine</HI>) properly sig∣nifieth that which is trampled and troden upon, derived of the word <HI>RAZAZ:</HI> the letter <HI>Aleph</HI> added according to the proprietie of the Hebrew tongue, which de∣monstateth the counsell and intention of creating the earth. For it was created, to the end that the most excellent creatures, for the which all things were created might tread, and walke upon it. <HI>MAIM,</HI> which is as much to say, as reasounding, braying, tu∣multuating; commeth of the verbe <HI>Hamah,</HI> which signifieth, to bray, cry, and make a noise. From this deduction therefore of the said <HI>Augustine,</HI> it appeareth, that <HI>EREZ</HI> and <HI>MAIM,</HI> signifie such an earth, and such waters, which is now the earth that serveth as a payement to terrestriall creatures, and a stay to them which walke and rest upon it; and the vast sea, which being gathered together by the exag∣geration of the Rivers, hath a perpetuall fluxe and refluxe roaring and making a great noise. And truely, seeing the Latine word <HI>Terra,</HI> is derived of <HI>tero,</HI> it answereth very properly to the word <HI>EREZ.</HI> Note this also, which the same <HI>Augustine</HI> admonish∣eth,
<PB N="32" REF="28"/>
that the word <HI>TEHEMON,</HI> is derived from the same verbe <HI>HAMAH,</HI> and signifieth, the resounding, or tumultuating Abisse, or deepe: therefore by the sig∣nification of the name, thou understandest that separative winde, which in the seventh Chapter I have declared to have beene incontinent from the beginning in the Chaos: nor any other spirit but this blast, to be understood to have agitated the whole masse; and therefore the distinction of the water from the earth, to have beene made partly in a naturall manner.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Itherto hath beene no other creation but of those things, which pertained to the generation of things necessary to the life of man; and might serve them for their habitations, to wit, the Elements, of which, or by the which these things ought to be engendred and sustained. Common sense divi∣deth all things created into three classes, or rather degrees; into those things which have a being; those things which have life or facultie vegetive; and those things which have sense. Which division well understood and considered, agreeth very elegantly to our subject, and aideth greatly our speculations, and giveth understanding. In the first degree, it behoveth not to understand one naked essence, without all forme, qualitie, and efficacie, such as the Philophers dreamed the first matter to be: for I have shewed that God never created any such thing, but it behoveth to understand the things, the which whatsoever they are invertue and power, yet are they without all motion: that in whatsoever place they are, there they rest, there hang, there by themselves they remaine immoveable, neither doe assume to themselves any augmentation, or, to speake more plainely, which have not in themselves force of encreasing: but as nature first formed them, so they are, and remaine, not having in them any life. In the second de∣gree are all things which have in them the first degree of life, to wit, facultie vegeta∣tive, and vertue of encreasing, and aspire no higher unto life. In the third degree are those things which (besides vertue vegetative) have also sensitive, and move them∣selves by their owne proper vertue, according to the condition of their sence. Hither∣to the degrees of the Creation proceede from the first matter: and because the vulger opinion is, that the spirit of man (by which onely hee differeth from bruit beasts) is not created of the first matter, but particularly and singularly of God: they doe put man himselfe in the number of other living creatures, and comprehend him in the third de∣gree of creatures. But when I shall have shewed in his place, that even the spirit of man is extracted out of the first matter, by intermediate degrees of perfection, it will appeare that wee must constitute in him a fourth degree of creatures. Therefore the first degree is of those things which are. The second of those things which are, and have a vegetative vertue, which is the first degree of life. The third, of those things which are, which live, and have sence: and by sence move voluntarily. The fourth of those things which are, which live, have sence, understand, and dis∣course: for the superiour degrees comprehend the inferiour. To these foure degrees it behoveth a Philosopher diligently to apply his minde, and ascending, and procee∣ding by these degrees, to observe the order of the Creation. Neither yet is it to bee imagined, that all those things which are of the first degree were procreated before things which are of the second: for it was not necessary that precious stones, and mettalls should be before hearbes. For we must set downe this in the first place: that those things were first to be created, which were first most requisite for the use of man. Pearles and mettalls, though they had beene created long after man, could bring nor cause no discommoditie at all unto him. But thou wilt say unto me, it was necessary those things to have beene created before the seaventh day; thou saiest well, but un∣derstand, it is to be judged, those things then to have beene created, when God com∣manded
<PB N="33" REF="28"/>
the earth to engender them: for the earth is ordayned to be the mother of these things, and remayneth mother, and in her selfe, and of her selfe conceiveth seed, whereof she produceth perpetually these things, and according to her fecundity per∣fecteth them in their time. But the tardity and slownesse of the perfection of a new species, doth not hinder generation; because it is the last and doth not engender con∣sequently. For if one pearle should procreate another pearle, and one mettall another like unto it selfe, then was it necessary a specificall and seminary vertue to have beene given to mettall, and pearle: which was the proper worke of the Creator, and not of the earth. So had it beene also necessary, that pearles, and mettals should have been perfected, and received from God into them, a specificall vertue before the seaventh day. So that we observe the order expressed in the generation of the world, it see∣meth that it behooved to have beene made, the third day; for there should have beene a like manner of engendring, both in the one, and the other: and both the one, and the other, should have beene numbred in the same degree: to wit, of things vegita∣tive, and alike increased in growth, the one, as the other. Therefore seeing that the Seminary faculty of these things consisteth in the earth; although some asistant, and (perhaps) formative vertue come from the celestials; it is to be thought that the Crea∣tion of these things was then perfected, when the seminary property, and generative vertue was given of the Lord to the earth which neverthelesse according to the natu∣rall progresse of things it is credible was done the third day, when as the earth was sufficiently made solid, and the starres now next had received their compleate forme. No inconvenience therefore doth from thence arise if mettals, and pearles, and all things which in like manner are engendred of the earth, have not a proper ver∣tue of propagating their species: they are said to have beene procreated certaine yeares after, when as the seminary property, and specificall vertue, which maketh the ge∣neration compleate, was in the beginning given to the earth.</P>
<P>Heere now is presented a double consideration of generation, which must be pru∣dently distinguished, to the end that the just order of the Creation, manifestly repre∣sented in <HI>Genesis,</HI> be not disturbed: and that the reason of the order may be through∣ly knowne. There is one property of the generation of the same species, which al∣wayes produceth his like, as a horse produceth a horse, a sheepe a sheepe &amp;c. to the ve∣ry end of the world, because it is done of its proper substance, and by its proper ver∣tue of engendring, Of the admirable mystery whereof we will speake in the Chap∣ter following. Another generation there is which engendreth not his like, but diffe∣ring in species, according to the quality of the Spirits of a divers kind which concurre together. So the Earth engendreth gold, sulphur, lead, and such like things, unlike unto it selfe and of another Species: the vertue whereof it hath in it selfe from the Creation, and not after, not doth acquire it any where else; but from the worke∣master the Creator.</P>
<P>You see then a double generation of Species, of the which that which is made of the same Species, requireth also the perfection of the species within six dayes of the Crea∣tion: whereby it may receive from the Creatour this specificall faculty of engendring, which neither the Earth, nor the heaven, nor any species before created can give: it on∣ly belongeth to the Creator, to communicate this vertue to the species that are created. And therefore although that the waters had produced the first species of fishes, and fly∣ing foules, yet he did not make the same specificall vertue perpetuall, &amp; proper to them all, but perfected the same vertue begun with the living Creatures, in the proper mat∣ter of the same species, taken from the waters, &amp; imprinted in it, and gave it unto them, saying, <HI>Encrease, and multiply, and fill the waters of the Sea, and let foule multiply in the Earth.</HI> But whatsoever species received not this benediction, they could not be multi∣plyed of themselves, but have a certaine accidentary generation other where: to wit, of a certaine element, or elements, whereunto God hath imparted that vertue of genera∣tion, then no doubt when every of them, having obtained a perfect species, received al∣so his proper nature, and his proper spirit, as also he communicated this same vertue to perfect living Creatures. And therefore seeing that the specificall vertue of these spe∣cies was imprinted in the elements already perfect, it was not necessary to produce stones, pearles, mettals, and such like to be conspicuous before the seaventh day; for their Creation was already effected in the elements. Neither had they neede of any
<PB N="34" REF="29"/>
further creation; their generation depending now naturally from the elements.</P>
<P>Now these degrees of things being constituted, let those who are studious of the farther secrets of Philosophy, take diligent heed, which of these are most noble, and by what order, by what also, and how many meanes they are brought to the per∣fection of their Species. But because the understanding, and reason, adde something above sence, and motive vertue, and this hath more than the vegetative: and againe, that this is the first accesse of those things which are unto life, it is easie to be under∣stood, that by the same order that these degrees are numbred, they are also formed and enabled by nature. We have an example of all in the generation of man, in whom the specificall vertue imprinted by the Parents in the seed, and therein produced, first, formeth the body, and the entralls, which all the while till the heart be formed, con∣sist in the first degree; but so soone as the heart is formed receive a vegetative nature, and beginne to attract to themselves nourishment, and to grow, but in the end almost of sixe weekes, having obtained the third degree, they moove: and then truely, can a man discover no appearance at all of understanding, or of a reasonable soule in the fruite, even from the first conception: if we grant that the soule was engendred of the Parents, but then as yet it is formed, and finished last, as being the most noble. All generation then proceedeth from the ignoble to the more noble, and is perfected by the soveraigne degree of every Species, nor doth ascend further. For nothing is a∣ble to overpasse the bound of his species, because further forces of extending it selfe, are not given to it, but the benediction of generation is terminated in the same species. So those things which onely are, although in nobility they excell others in their kind, yet they cannot attaine to the power of growing. Of those things which have the faculty vegetative, some are more noble than others: but they cannot attaine unto sence: and living creatures, whose marke in their species is sense and motion, doe not attaine unto understanding: for this surpasseth all things, and representeth the I∣mage of God.</P>
<P>The same order (now Reader) thou wilt observe to have beene kept in the creati∣on of things: for hitherto God hath created the things which are: hereafter, (the more noble substance being taken from these) he will create those things, which are of the second degree, to wit, hearbes, and plants; that done, living creatures, which are of the third degree, and among them; first, those things, which come from the wa∣ters, and more ignoble, after the terrestrials, which being endowed with a more sub∣tle, dry, and warmer spirit, are also more subtile in sense, and approach something to the understanding: Finally man himselfe, who should have the dominion over the o∣ther in reason and wisedome: So the more noble are last after all created, because they have neede of a more noble matter, and more purified and digested, and there∣fore they are later perfected: nature, which was first created, alwayes working ac∣cording to the spirit, and manner given him from Gods Idea. But the Idea of God, is the worke of his wisedome, the will of order, vertue, and proportion of things to be created, and sustained. In summe, if any man will search more diligently the or∣der of things, and consider the communion and difference of Species, he will perceive that the Creation of things (beginning from the more base and ignoble Species) so al∣most ascended upward, as a tree hath at first but onely a truncke, wherein all things which are from the roote to the very top, are but one and the same thing by the com∣munion of Species, every of the parts in the meane time having their veines therein: but when they beginne to have any difference among themselves, the first division of the truncke is made into branches, after (every branch remayning a certaine time un∣till their veines divide themselves one from another) is made the second division, and so consequently untill we come to the last branches and fruits. So the Chaos is the onely truncke of all the Species to be created, having his roote and beginning in the universall Idea Creatrix, which is in the mind, and divine will. In this truncke all things as yet are one, lying hid and communicating in the seminary propriety of the Chaos. Furthermore, as this universall Idea, creatrix of things, by the division of the species into their determinate number and forme, ascending by little and little, doth divide it selfe, so of one simple species of Chaos without forme, the difference of species by little and little doe arise, for so long the substances of all the destinated species remaine one, untill they tend perfectly to the difference in that wherein they
<PB N="35" REF="29"/>
communicate. Whence those things which as yet communicate, being contained in one branch, doe cohere and sticke together, untill they come into the way of their pro∣per species, every one following their owne high, and extreame, and perfect species. So there being of all the parts, as through all the branches of the Creature, made all excoction, distillation, purification, extenuation; sublimation, or after what else so∣ever this last act, tending to the extreame end of operation, is to be named, at length we come to all species conceived. But that is to be remembred, that those things which are of a most high degree are more slowly perfected. Seeing they ascend by intermediate degrees. So a living creature seeing he ascendeth by three degrees, to wit, by being, and by a vegetative species, even unto sense and motion, it is necessa∣ry that that which is vegetative be perfected in one degree first. For so it is to be thought of that universall Idea, which is in God, that it doth so make its impressions in the Creation, that beginning from the truncke by inconfused order, and right way, it doth by little and little goe by the lesse noble, and more noble species, to the produ∣ction of the highest, and perfecteth together those that are of the same degree: after those which are of a sequent, and more noble ranck, as we see in the creation of plants, living Creatures, and of man.</P>
<P>Now the species, which consist in one degree, or are of one kind, as in the kinde of plants, the willow, and the Oake; are distinguished by certaine degrees, or by a kind of excellence, and noblenesse one from another, wherefore there is some thing more perfect, and more noble, and later effected in the one than in the other, thence it com∣meth that the Oake groweth and increaseth more slowly than the willow, yet never∣thelesse the Creation of the Oake was finished the third day, as well as that of the wil∣low. For (as we shall anon see) the specificall vertue is brought forth together with the bud of the hearbe, and imprinted in the plant by the Idea formatrix. For the crea∣tion of things which are like to engender like to themselves, is finished by these two, to wit, by the same species, and by the specificall vertue, that is to say of propagating the species: the encreasements which follow after, and the generation of fruits are naturall workes of the same species, which follow that vertue and the Creation. But heere it behooveth to remember what we have said in the seaventh Chapter, which is, that so soone as the matter of any thing was prepared, there withal together the species of things to be created was brought forth; although the thing it selfe was of later growth, as the Sunne begunne to be Created the first day, when God Created the light, and yet was not perfected till the fourth day. So the waters being prepared, the species of fishes begunne to be created the third day, and the earth being dryed up, the species of terrestriall living creatures: and yet these things were not perfected till the fifth day. So the third day the species also of hearbes, and plants began to be crea∣ted, and yet were not finished till the fourth day. For <HI>Moses</HI> onely noteth the time when the workes were finished. The species therefore of plants, and of terrestriall living creatures, were brought forth when the earth, the mother of them, was per∣fectly finished: but the things of a more solid substance were finished, as the Oake the fourth day did grow later than the hearbes. These things concerning the degrees and order of things to be created and considered, come we now to the creation of plants, which is the other part of the worke of this third Day.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter the separation of the waters (which are under the heaven) from the Earth, during the blast, as yet followed the other worke of this day, the Creation of hearbes, whereof now we will treate. Forasmuch as man, and the other living Creatures, were to live of hearbes and fruites, the creation passeth to the second degree of things, which is the first of life,
<PB N="36" REF="30"/>
and because they were to serve for their nourishment, God found out a meanes where∣by they should be multiplyed by seed, and specificall vertue, or propagative, which God blessed that they might suffice unto all living Creatures. For although the bene∣diction of multiplication be not added, a man may well understand that it was done, be∣cause he hath annexed it to other Creatures and <HI>vers.</HI> 29.30. of the second of <HI>Genesis.</HI> he giveth these things there for foode to all living Creatures. But the benediction which is expressed, of fishes and of foules, is <HI>ver.</HI> 22. <HI>Encrease, and multiply, and reple∣nish the waters, and the Earth,</HI> and to men he saith, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. <HI>Encrease, and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the Sea, and over the foule of the ayre, and over every living thing that mooveth upon the Earth.</HI> The Earth then being prepared for generation, God said, <HI>Let the Earth put forth her bud, every hearbe producing seede, according to its kinde,</HI> that is to say, from whence may grow the hearbe of the same species, and every Tree bearing fruite, yeelding fruite according to its kind, whose seed is in it selfe upon the Earth: that is, let it bring forth fruite wherein the seede of the same species may spring in the meane time, while the tree groweth upon the Earth out of which another tree of the same species may spring. When he saith, <HI>Let the Earth put forth her bud,</HI> it is certaine that the hearbe and the tree had not their perfection in the same instant that he said it, but both the one and the other, by the specificall Idea, and benediction of God, from one point, and at once (as it were) of the Earth; no otherwise then from a seede (which being but small, hath yet all its vertue in the least part, and bud thereof, which is contained and lyeth hid in one of the ends) commeth to burgeon, bud, and by little and little to grow into a great plant, or tree.</P>
<P>Now that we are come to the first degree of life, it is necessary first to search dili∣gently, and prosecute the nature and condition of the Spirituall substance, from whence life taketh its beginning. As I have said from the sixth Chapter, that all things are come by evaporation, and exhalation from the Chaos: afterwards the elements being so prepared for generation, and the celestiall things for influence, the omnipo∣tent Creator tooke the Atomes of vertues, or the least particles of the water and the earth, whereinto he put a specificall vertue according to the Idea's, and according to the number of the Idea's comprehended in his wisedome, and withall added the be∣nediction of engendring their like, to the end they might multiply the same species, be∣ing perpetually conserved. But the spirituall substance is the more noble part of ele∣ment or generative body, which attracting nourishment, converting it into its nature, and protruding it forward to the increase and growth of the body, hath vertue from the benediction, and from nature. So the Earth, the water, the ayre, and other bo∣dies, exhale from themselves a spirituall substance, by meanes of the heate, which by the specificall substance of the seede is converted into the same nature and species, and affordeth encrease, and growth, or motion, and sense, according to the conditi∣on of the species. The like substance when it is engendred in the bowels of the earth, and produceth its species within the earth, doth not bring any encrease at all to the species, but is coagulated, curdled, and bound together into it indissoluble, not possi∣ble to be disjoyned from it: neither doth exhale otherwhere, diffusing its odour, or vertue, but onely by contraction and operation of the permanent quality. So Gold is coagulated and joyned together in the quality of the Spirituall substance, and re∣ceiveth not encrease, but rather is contracted by the sulphureous heate, that it may be made more ponderous, and weighty. Stones are in like manner engendred. Hearbes and trees, seeing they are to grow and increase, have a more soft nourishment, apt to extend: therefore also they exhale and yeeld odours and vertues, and at length by lit∣tle and little are consumed, being come by growth to maturity. This spirituall sub∣stance is that alone which preserveth its species (I meane that which is in the plant, not that which is without) for this being first attracted, and drawne from that, is chan∣ged into the species and afterward doth nourish it, and conserve it: and doth nourish it so long time, as there is nothing which corrupteth the same species, conserving al∣wayes the same characterismes, and markes of leaves, of flowers, branches, and fruites; the odour, savour, colour, and other accidents, so firmely, that if but a little slip, or bud, be graffed into another plant, there also will it follow its owne naturall property, changing all its nourishment into its owne species. But all the nourishment
<PB N="37" REF="30"/>
so attracted; is changed into the forme of that part whereunto it last commeth. So the juice of a tree being come to the fruite, is changed into the species of fruite; being come to the leafe, is changed into the species of the leafe. And the nourishment of the living Creature, when at last it is attracted to the liver, is converted into the li∣ver, when to the rootes of any musile, it passeth into its substance, and so of all o∣thers: and every member draweth unto it selfe, that which is most fit for it selfe. But some things which are unfit to nourish the body, nature expelleth, some into haire, some into nailes, some into scabs, others otherwise: or quite out of the body. Some things which by a hidden vertue are appropriated to some part of the entrals, doe strive thitherward by a naturall property. Therefore this seminary and spirituall sub∣stance, is a thing very divine, wherein there is from the Creation all specificall facul∣ty and vertue formative, wherein is stirred up by meanes of the heart all motion of the body necessary to the living Creature, that the vertue thereof might be still ready to assist all the extreame parts of it: and doth afford like seede for generation, that the continuation of the same species may remaine to the end of all things. But wee must know and consider this, that the same species doth not come by influence from the starres, but from that into the which God first put it, and whereunto he gave the benediction of generation: the Starres surely are a helpe, but the originall and roote of all species, is in these inferiour things. But seeing that this world is (as it were) one body, having harmonious parts among themselves, and conspiring together in one, as also all living creatures, to the image whereof, and of God, man (as a little world) was created, bearing the Image of God, and having like Oeconomy of parts; it is credible that the world hath also the Sunne for its heart, as the beginning of all life, and that it had its being from the beginning, when the light was created, and that it performeth the same office in the world, within the Concavity of the Firma∣ment; that the heart doth in man, cherishing all things above, and below, by its heate and light, and that therefore it hath beene placed in the middle of the world, or a little higher, even as the heart in man.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>OD hath given such a seminary species throughout the whole world, where the temperature of the element was proper thereunto, that the vertue of that species was never anywhere wanting; for the Plants do not change their place, nor walke upon the earth like living creatures, but abiding in their place, doe there cast mature seede: neither was care of transplanting them imposed to man, as to whom all things necessarie presented them∣selves voluntary and of their owne accord. And seeing that the wisedome of God hath created nothing in vaine, and without cause, which is not profitable to some necessitie of life, it was most certaine that there is not any disease, nor defect of nature, for the which hee hath not provided a most propitious remedy. Wherefore he hath caused to bud and spring so many species of Plants, as was needfull for the conservation and su∣stentation of the life of man, and of all living creatures, and placed the tree of life in the midst of Paradise, to the end that man by the use thereof, might preserve his life in health, untill, being made more divine by the exercise and obedience of the comman∣dement, he might be translated into heaven.</P>
<P>So also the bruit living creatures seeke succour for their nature: the Swallow, the Chelidony, the Catineppe, named the hearbe, from the Cat, the Toad, the Plantine, and Sage, the Dogge-grasse, called Dogges-tooth, the Torteise <HI>marioram,</HI> the Weesell rue, the Storke origan, the Partridge parierary, called also <HI>perdicium,</HI> the Hawke hierac, the Dove vermine, the Pye also being sicke, is said to carry baye leaves into her nest, that she may chase away her sicknesse by them. So beleeve that the Harts have
<PB N="38" REF="31"/>
shewed, that the hearbe <HI>dictamnum</HI> healeth them being wounded with arrowes, the weapon ejected by eating thereof, wee suppose that the Hindes have demonstrated the hearbe called <HI>Saselis,</HI> and that the Serpents have made Fennell in high estimation: for wee know that by the tasting and eating thereof, they have stripped themselves of old age, and by the juice thereof, regained the sharpenesse of their sight. Which also a man might shew more at large, seeing that beasts themselves instructed by nature, have shewed to mortall men the vertues of many hearbes knowne unto them. But hee hath created in every region such species of Plants, as are most agreeable in temperature to men, and living creatures there borne, which by experiments is often proved; so that by the onely abundance of Plants which one seeth spring, a man may almost perceive to what popular (that is to say, ordinarily diseases) every region is subject. So among the Danes, Frises, Hollanders, who are much subject to that disease, commonly called <HI>Scorbut,</HI> there is in abundance the hearbe called Cochlearia, as a proper medicine to that disease; so in marish places. So the Tamariske acknowledgeth the native soile: the inhabitants are exposed and subject to the indispositions of the spleene, as their pale colour sheweth, which is discovered in their swelling skinne, and puffed up Hypo∣chondries. In like manner is observed that in those quarters where Wormewood groweth about hedges, in courtyards, the inhabitants are ordinarily affected with the obstructions of their entrals, weakenesse of the stomacke, and suffusion of the gall, that if the passages of the entrals be not opened by the use of the said herbe, and strengthe∣ned, and made firme by the evacuation of the gall, they come first to have the Iaundise, and after, by little and little, endender water betwene the skinne and the flesh. And although that some things are contrary and venimous to some, yet being used in their kinde, they are healthfull; so of the very worst poison, is made the noble treacle, and there is nothing created so averse from the nature of man, the use whereof is not some way or other profitable. Now let us treate of the seede. God created the hearbes and the plants of the Atomes of the earth, by the worke of the wisedome, Idea, and benediction of God; but so he created them as they now spring of seede, for there is the same operation of the first generation, as of the second seeing the same species is, and remaineth.</P>
<P>As then out of the seede groweth the plant, so it is produced of the Atome of the earth, formed by the Idea into a certaine species: and on the contrary. And from the seed a little young bud, contained in one of the ends thereof: in what part it maketh the point of the seede, it attracteth the humour of the Earth, or of the water, and formeth one little roote or more, according to the property of the species, and the nourishment being attracted by them into the other end of the seede produceth the trunke, and thereafter the branches and leaves, that adhere unto it. But the specifi∣call vertue is in this little young bud, which changeth into its nature and species, all the nourishment which it attracteth. The same reason is in the terrestriall Atome, for∣med by the Idea, for it produceth its buds no otherwise then doth the seede. Further∣more, as this nourishment attracted, is carryed higher, so is it more and more chan∣ged into the forme of that which springeth from it, into branches divided from the truncke, into leaves, into flowers, and into fruites. The most perfect of all is the fruite, wherein is perfectly accomplished the seede which is given for the multipli∣cation of the species. And the higher things excied to encrease by the heate; doe at∣tract juice from the inferiours, but the roote not able to administer sufficient nourish∣ment to the higher, taketh new attractive rootes: whereby it gathereth nourish∣ment more copiously. Hence it followeth that those plants which have more rootes▪ their higher parts have neede of more nourishment, and their fruites are more moist, except the rootes be of greater use then their fruites: wherein the divine wisedome hath provided for the use of the living Creatures, So the hearbes, the rootes where∣of are ordayned to be eaten, attract more juice, and their rootes are more succulent, and more grosse: nature procuring encrease principally to rootes, and not to hearbes: those that are more long, are ordinarily of a more dry and a more fat substance: as those which seeke a more dry nourishment at the bottome. From the accident, and pro∣perties of rootes, many things may be observed, which appertaine to the search of nature, and of those hearbes. But in hearbes, the juice attracted is carryed upward by the parts not yet changed: but in trees, by the barke, as being more spongious, till
<PB N="39" REF="31"/>
that (having stayed there a certaine space of time) it be changed from the neerer part, and that which is most noble, and more purified, is then carryed upward into flowers, into fruites, and for seede. Many speculations will present themselves heere to one that will search after them. Now that the juice attracted is so carryed upward, as I have said, the graffings of young scienes in trees, teacheth us sufficiently; for in them the humour attracted is first communicated to the barke of the young scienes, there staying some space of time, doth unite the barkes of the young scienes to the barkes of the stemmes, and after conjoyneth wood to wood: but the species which is in the stemme, is changed into species of the young sciene, which is engraffed. So ac∣cording to the commandement of God, the same species produceth alwayes the same things, whether from the seede, or from the young sciene engraffed, and consequent∣ly bringeth forth branches, leaves, fruites, and seed, according to the nature of the species. It is not unprofitable also to consider, in how long time, and how long space from the earth, the fruit and the seed come to their growth, and with what humours the plants are delighted above the rootes, and what they avoyd: and (if it be possible) af∣ter what manner the juice is changed through every degree, in the roote, in the trunck, in the leaves, in the flowers, in the fruite, and in the seed: for so the nature of the species may be more exactly knowne. This at leastwise is acknowledged, that the nourishment of the plant, is much more noble in the fruite, than in the plant: but most noble in the seed, as that which is the end and scope of the Creation of all this species.</P>
<P>Now by those things we have already said, a man may gather, that divers hearbes and trees have beene created in divers regions, and experience teacheth, that there be some in America, or new India, which are found no where in this our continent, Asia, Affrica, and Europe; which have not beene in the use of men untill some travelled thither, which I suppose was after the time of Christ and his Apostles. In like manner there be there living Creatures, which are not at all found in our continent, which without doubt have beene there from the Creation of the world. Whereupon I pre∣sume that these lands were not overwhelmed with the Flood, when God would de∣stroy mankind, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. unto <HI>vers.</HI> 7. For no men at all were there, and therefore the living Creatures there Created, and there inhabiting, ought not to be destroyed, as man was to perish, whom it repented that he had Created, seeing that in living crea∣tures he found no cause wherefore they ought to be destroyed, But in this our con∣tinent the living creatures ought to perish; except some had beene preserved in the Arke, for they were not able to live in the waters.</P>
<P>When therefore God Created heere and there throughout the world the vertue of the tree of life, by one and the same meanes he provided, both for the one, and the o∣ther estate of man; for that of innocency, and the other of sinne; and the vertue of the tree of life in paradise, or dispersed throughout the world was not for nought. For the world comming to be replenished with men, all should have had accesse to the tree of life: but the hearbes and the plants growing heere and there; had beene equivalent and man had a certaine choise, and the benediction had diverted all sick∣nesse. Seeing then that they were most wisely created for the use and service of man, aswell in the superiour, as in the inferiour world, what a faire harmony was there then? when the lower things did accord with the highest, and expected helpe from them; and the highest communicated their gifts to the lowest, and all things served man, untill he should be translated of God into his heavenly habitation. This corres∣pondency, this beauty of state had continued immutable if <HI>Adam</HI> had not sinned, yet this same harmony, if one consider it more diligently, is as yet discovered in the traces of their first nature, for there is nothing so little which doth not serve to something, and which doth not depend of one more perfect: all things are for man.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore all things tend to their end and scope, and that scope (that is to say man) consisteth of divers parts, which yet keepe among themselves a most agree∣able harmony, as that wherein life consisteth: of those some serve to the stomacke, some to the liver, some to the heart, some to the blood, some to the reynes, &amp;c. wherefore there are so many simples, or plants, as there be entrals in man, and af∣fections of them. And seeing that every thing changeth into its species the nourish∣ment
<PB N="40" REF="32"/>
that it attracteth, and that there are divers stations in mans body, and divers wayes to every extreame station, by the which the nourishment passeth, as in the ven∣tricle, the liver, the blood, the spleene &amp;c. those simples are stronger, or passe soo∣ner as friends by the middle stations, which carry their vertue, entire even to the ex∣treames, and there worke: and as for those which cannot be there changed by nature, either they are venemous, or noysome to nature. Those things which are changed in the first stations are friends to nature, or of small vertue. Those which of an en∣tire vertue penetrate, unto the extreame stations, being friends to nature, are they which are more appropriate to that member, or to that part of the entrals, and have certaine characters, whereby they may be knowne, if a man take diligent heede. For we see that those which resemble nature, greatly communicate also in figure, as O∣nyons, Garlike, and such like, have a forme of a small scallion for their roote, and produce almost alike hearbe upward, if their flowers differ in colour this com∣meth to passe by a certaine difference and peculiar property that is in them.</P>
<P>So there are many hearbes and trees which have dented leaves about like a Sawe, which for the same cause so bud, and therefore they have something alike in nature, wherein they doe agree. Many hearbes also and plants have their leaves not dented about, but terminated equally; many that are dented, grow pointed, many round, as rue, many sharpe edged, hard, and pricking, as the yewe tree. All ought diligently to be observed, for they are not such by casualty, but by nature so producing them perpetually: wherefore seeing nature produceth nothing temerary, rashly, and the cause of the same figure is created to be perpetually the same, it is necessary that many things, by a certaine law of species, are alike, and have a certaine communion of na∣ture. Moreover seeing there is a conspiration, and society both of celestiall and ter∣restriall things, tending to the same scope and end, which is man: and the celestiall are eternall, and the species also in this inferiour world are eternall, having alwayes the same generations in forme, and in figure, and depending every one of their pro∣per celestiall causes; it is necessary that taking heede to the characters of the plants, a man doe gather, and observe many things which have respect to one and the same Starre, and many things also participating of the same nature (among the Physitians) in which things they have a mutuall correspondence, as in figure, colour, taste, and o∣ther qualities: for so, by the resemblance, a man may learne to judge of the nature of things. For every nature hath its proper character, which it ever keepeth alike, na∣ture in the Heavens communicating its vertue thereunto. These things according to my speculation (such as it is) I was desirous to admonish the Reader, that he might ad∣vance by his studies, a thing above all other most profitable, wherein <HI>Salomon</HI> obtai∣ned much praise, 3 <HI>King.</HI> 4.33. For why may not a man search by study and industry the things which are before his eyes, and follow perpetually in figure, and in forme, the same law of nature? It is a laborious worke indeed: but labour overcommeth all things.</P>
<P>I have heard the most learned <HI>Reinerus Solinander,</HI> Physition to the illustrious Prince <HI>Iuliers,</HI> discoursing most accurately and pertinently touching the charecters of hearbes: who I would God he would proceede to take some paines in so necessary a part of Philosophie (if there be any able to doe it, it is he, being of that great dexte∣ritie of judgement, in the searching out of the nature, and causes of things) we should have in briefe the demonstrations of the characters, and hidden apparitions of them to every part of the entrals.</P>
<P>Therefore while God doth constitute every where the vertues of the tree of life, the <HI>Psalmist</HI> saith well, <HI>Psal.</HI> 111.2. <HI>The workes of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein:</HI> he doth alwayes direct to his scope or end, the worke which he had preordained: be it that <HI>Adam</HI> obeyed the first commandement, or not obeyed, and that in soveraigne wisedome, mercy, goodnesse, and justice.</P>
<P>After that, according to my small understanding, I have treated of the nature and varietie of Plants, there is one soveraine miracle of nature very remarkeable; which is that so many things which are in every species, as for example, the greatnesse, the forme, the figure, the odour, the taste, the colour, the leaves, the sinewes, the rootes, the barke, the vertue; and infinite things which are in one onely plant, are hidden in one so small graine of seede as I have said. For all the vertue of the species is hid in one
<PB N="41" REF="32"/>
so small a graine, when as that little graine hath nothing in it like unto all that, no not any appearance at all, but is wholly homogeneall, of the same kinde, and appeareth altogether of the same nature. Wherefore me thinkes I judge aright that the most simple Idea which in the beginning formed the seede accompanieth as yet the species, and continueth the same worke untill generation cease. And this is that which Christ saith, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.17. <HI>My father worketh hitherto, and I also worke.</HI> Whence it appeareth that there be a Sabbath, or rest from the creation, yet is it not from the sustentation of the Creatures, but that this worke endureth even to the end of all things: I doe not see what other thing can be here said.</P>
<P>He that is curious of this speculation, let him consider chiefely what accidents are pro∣per to every species, and search out the causes of them if he can: in the first place that he give good heede to the figure, and that he observe by what order the growth there∣of is made from the roote unto the top: in what manner also it doth proceede, and is distributed by the barke, by the veines, and by the sinewes, even to the compasse there∣of, and so at length without doubt, he shall finde out the proper character of all na∣ture: The end of the third Day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the Creation of the Lights.</HI> The fourth Day beginneth.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lthough the creation of Lights was not perfectly finished till the fourth Day, yet they begun to be created the first Day, that is, evident, be∣cause there is no other light that distinguisheth the day from the night, than that of the Sunne: as verse 14. that property is ascribed unto it: and now three dayes are already passed, wherefore that light which distinguished the first day from the night, without doubt was that light of the Sunne to come, dispersed as yet, but contracted into the Hemisphere of heaven, environing the whole Chaos, and which from the beginning tur∣ned upon the Poles of the world. So that the first day, the heaven and the motion thereof, together with the light begun to be created. For in the fourth verse it is said, that God separated the light from the darkenesse; which could not make the day and the night, but by the collection of the light into one part of heaven, and extending it to Paradise. Therefore, seeing the day followeth the night, the creation of the light fell to be in that moitie, which was under the Horizon of Paradise, where becomming more strong and more collected, by its motion towards the West, ascen∣ded from the orientall part of Paradise above the Horizon thereof, and made the Day. But the collection of the substance of the Sunne, of the Moone, and of the Starres, was not perfectly finished, till the fourth day; for <HI>Moses</HI> describeth the time when the workes were fully finished, which dependeth, and is defined from the perpetuall Will of God. Yet the Sunne (which I have said before, Chapter the twelfth, to be the heart of the world, even as the heart is in living creatures) ought to have beene created before all things: therefore he begun with the first Creation of the light. But the Sunne having received a most cleare, and lucide substance, obtained the dominion and rule of the day; the Moone of the night, as not illuminating the night by its owne light, but very little, yea in the whole Ecclipse thereof when the aire is cleare, yet ap∣peareth the circle of it, but the light very small. But the Starres and constellations, seeme to have a stronger light, but farre inferiour to that of the Sunne.</P>
<P>That is to be observed which he saith, that the lights were placed in the firmament of heaven: and verse 8. <HI>He calleth the firmament heaven,</HI> whence a man may gather, that the Chaos was created much lesse than the world now is, and from <HI>Aphar,</HI> and (as it were) a slimie Abysse of the Chaos, the matter being educted and extenuated,
<PB N="42" REF="33"/>
was elevated upward, and by little and little, as it departed farther from the Center, being made more and more subtile and noble, as it extended it selfe, begirded and com∣posed the more grosse Elements. And so the Empyriall heaven was made the most sub∣tile and noble, as being the throne of God, and the habitation of the blessed. Vnder that the <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> the first moveable, a heaven a little more grosse, and lesse noble. Vnder that the other Heavens and Planets, which by how much nearer they are to the earth, by so much they are of a more grosse and lesse noble substance, lesse extended. So that the heaven of the Moone is the most grosse, and next in condition to the elements. This expansion or entending, maketh the superiour things lighter, and the separation of them from those that are more grosse; maketh them more noble. Moreover, the luminous matter which was prepared for the substance of the Starres and lights, was not extended, but contracted, that they might shine more strongly, and become more conspicuous. So it commeth that the Starres are of a thicker substance than the rest of the heaven, yet equally light, because it is fie∣rie, and also thicker, that the light might be the more strong and powerfull, and the reflexion of the beames; cast from the other Starres, which doth illuminate the night: especially that which is reflected from the Moone; but that light which is di∣rected from the Sunne, doth divide the day from the night.</P>
<P>Besides these offices of the two lights, it is added, that they may be for signes, and for seasons, and for dayes, and for yeares. Here the Astronomers by signes understand certaine aspects of the Starres, whereby things to come are betokened: but they erre greatly, for that wherefore the lights were created, is of farre greater moment than the divers divinations of the Astrologers, to wit, that men, whom God had lodged in this edifice, might learne to know the omnipotencie and goodnesse of their Creator, which <HI>David</HI> sheweth very clearely, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.1. <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handie worke.</HI> And Saint <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 1.19. That which may be knowne of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them: for the in∣visible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearely seene, being under∣stood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and God-head. These two lights therefore are for this cause chiefely set in heaven, that by these workes of God, the omnipotency, majestie and divinitie of the Creator might be made knowne unto men, and not to the intent they should serve for the vanitie of Astrologers. Moreover, they are given for the designation of times, when they are to be changed. So they will demonstrate the end of times, and judgment of the world, when they shall be obscu∣red, and desolved. So at the time of the passion of Christ, when the time of the Law was to be changed, <HI>Dionysius</HI> the Areopagite saw the admirable ecclipse of the Sunne. And <HI>Ioshua</HI> perceived the admirable hand of God by the Sunne, <HI>Josh.</HI> 10.13. They are also set to define the dayes and the yeares. The Starres also, which by night adorne the heaven above, doe also illuminate the earth below, and by their position shew the annuall circuit of the Sunne. The end of the fourth Day.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE second degree of things having beene treated of, now is handled the third, concerning things which are, which have vegetation and motion: and first of those which come from the waters, which are of a lesse solid substance, doe more easily encrease, and are not so long lived, which are divided into many species, and every one of them en∣gender among themselves the seede of their species from the which species comming to maturitie, and dispersed, the same species groweth: but the in∣dividuals
<PB N="43" REF="33"/>
of every Species, have alwayes the same characters or markes. So that there is alwayes the same number and figure of the bones, the same colour, the same forme of body and of other members, the same force, nature and savour, as also in hearbes and in plants, but divers species have also divers impressions of characters; differing in figure, or some accident: of which difference, if thou canst gather the cause, thou mayst contemplate more nearely the proper nature of every species. For the proper nature of every species maketh different impressions of the Characters, and this doth follow the other as from the effect a man may gather the cause, and from the cause, the nature. In the contemplation of foules, the same things offer themselves to be considered. But because that the substance of foules is more solid, and consequently longer lived, therefore also the workemanship of them was later finished this day: although they begunne to be formed together, when the waters were gathered into the Seas. For the matter of every thing being prepared, inconti∣nent the Creation proceeded, and ceased not till all things were fully finished, and the Sabbath, or rest from all the worke of the Creation was come. For there is no cause wherefore the matter being once prepared, the Creation of things should be suspended. God Created many things as well as one, and the naturall order of crea∣ting things, is elegantly observed. The Starres also, which served more neerely un∣to life, were now also the precedent fourth day perfectly finished, that they might the more powerfully conferre their aid, than when the hearbes were created. So the nature of things Created, so soone as it was prepared, began to exercise its office, and all things co-operating together, the Fabricke of the world went forward. Oh ad∣mirable wisedome! which sufficed for the creating of the order, the nature, the or∣nament, the perfection, and the vertues of so many different things, and all with∣out study or reasoning! for he speaketh the word, and they were made. It shall be good heere to make an anatomy of every one of the species, that it may be knowne in what things the impressions of the characters of every one are different, and in what manner, and by how many stations the nourishment is changed into the species, in what station the blood is created in fishes. Thou shalt find also in fishes, by the ad∣mirable providence, a little bladder full of aire inclosed in it, which taketh encrease together with the fish, whose office is to sustaine it pendant, in what part of the wa∣ter soever it be, least by the weight of the body it sinke to the bottome. Thou shalt find also in females many egges, which being broken against the rockes, or other∣wise by the vertue of nature forced out, come to multiply their species, and even as the seede of the plant, being cast beyond its mother (seing it hath a specificall vertue in it selfe) produceth the same species in its element: be it in the Earth or in the wa∣ter. So also these egges of fishes being cast into the water, there receive life, and shew the same species, and the same character of their mother. Neither shall it be unprofitable also to rip up the severall species of birds, and to consider their inferiour parts, and the functions of every one of them, that the causes of the impressions of the characters, and the originall of their proper nature may more rightly be knowne. In the which are procreated egges one at a time, and are excluded, having for there coverture a shell somewhat hard, least the specificall vertue should more easily come to exhale: the which also being separated from their mother, keepe their specificall vertue, and being hatched by the heate of the mother, or also by stoves, as is used in Egypt for the space of sixe moneths, or a moneth produce birds of the same species. Moreover, they are conceived by the copulation of the Male and Female, as other li∣ving Creatures. But heere heede is to be taken principally to the difference of fish, and of foules, that though they were perfectly finished in one and the same day, yet doe they not consist of the same matter: but foules because they resemble more terrestri∣all living Creatures, as is manifested by the blood, and by the whole constitution of their body, they have more terrestriall substance than fishes, that they seeme to come of muddy water, and fishes of more pure water. Foules therefore are of a middle rancke betweene terrestriall living Creatures, and fishes; nearer to the nature of ter∣restriall living Creatures, than of fishes: and therefore later this day finished. But there is one thing most worthy to be observed in all living Creatures, that is, that they doe imitate in some sort the shape of man; whole nature (as it were) tending to the forming of man, and not having its entire perfection but in man, for although
<PB N="44" REF="34"/>
they have a longer head, they are furnished with all instruments in some sort alike, for sence, and motion; the bones of the head are alike, their backe bone answereth in some sort to the backe bone of man, and their ribbes to his ribbes, and all the mem∣bers are formed according to the nature, and operation of every one.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>EE have seene two sorts of the third degreë of things created, Fishes and Foules; now followeth the third kinde, terrestriall living Crea∣tures, which how much the later they were created, so much the li∣ker are they unto man, both in sense and motion; but in reason man surpasseth them all, they being destitute heereof. But of terrestriall living Creatures some are more like man then others, as they write of the Elephant, that it is a docible beast, and commeth neere to man in understanding; What shall we say of the Ape, which sporting imitateth mans actions? is angry, laugheth, applaudeth, seriously smelleth, warily beholdeth a thing, as deliberating whether it be good to eate; crackes nuts with her teeth like a man, and while she is busie about her owne worke, lookes upon the by-standers what they doe: she hath head, feete, and hands very like those of man, and in all things, is that amongst living Creatures, which commeth neerest the characters, and nature of man. For this cause it were not amisse diligently to consider the anatomy of this Creature, and to examine how much and in what, the interiour disposition thereof differeth from that of man; that the animall vertues may be knowne by the inward impressions. For I thinke that those depend upon these, or being after a speciall manner engraffed by nature, are by impression of the character, as by a fit instrument stirred up unto action, which yet seemeth ambiguous and doubtfull. For it appeareth that every thing hath in it selfe a certaine principle of its owne nature, which dyeth with it, so that the cause of the nature of every thing is created together with it, and is not from elsewhere. But we must anatomize every species, that the inward difference of all living Creatures a∣mongst themselves, may be perceived, and the difference of the animall vertues may appeare, from the diversity of the impressions of their characters, so shall you finde out, for what reasons, the vertues animall are more excellent in foules, than in fishes, in beasts than in foules, in men than in beasts, and understand a most excellent order, from things lesse solid; from the lesse perfect, to the more perfect, from the lesse lively, to the more lively; from things temporall to those eternall.</P>
<P>All living creatures are nourished of such things as the earth bringeth forth, every one choosing naturally what best agreeth with his owne nature, and this is profita∣ble to be knowne. For although the nature of every one changeth his nourishment into his species, yet is there some vertue in hearbes, and fruites, which turneth and altereth the said aliment into their owne nature, especially where there is affinity of natures, and easie digestion, yea they can also change venime, and corrupt it: but by the force of a contrary nature. Birds also feed on fishes, as being in kind nearer them, and every thing delighteth in that which comes nearer the nature thereof, ex∣cept that which is of the same species, which every living Creature loveth, man one∣ly excepted, who hath forgot his originall. Venimous beasts, besides their nature good for something, have this commodity, that they every where sucke up the vemine, and are nourished with it, but other beasts devoure them without harme, so well hath nature provided for the safety of living Creatures. But heere remaineth one question to be answered: whether that the same condition of living creatures which
<PB N="45" REF="34"/>
now is, had beene the same, in case man had not sinned? without doubt they should have dyed, their life being worne out, and should have beene food one for another, o∣therwise the world could not have contayned their multiplication. And to what end should they have beene immortall, when they were onely ordained for the service of man? seeing such infinite encrease should have beene for no use: They had reveren∣ced man undoubtedly, and beene obedient to him, for God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28, 29, 30. made <HI>Adam</HI> Lord of all things under Heaven.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE fourth degree of things created, and the most perfect is man, for use and service all things were hitherto created, and as all those things a∣mong themselves have a kinde of order, and harmonie, for their mu∣tuall assistance; so all these together have a certaine conformitie, and harmonie unto man, in nature, qualitie, and operations, and therefore man is of the Greekes called the little world. But this conformitie, and hermonie, is so farre as concerneth the animall part of man.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is a thing farre more noble in man, that hee exceëdeth the dig∣nitie of all creatures, to wit, the reasonable soule, according to which he was created after the Image and the similitude of God. And because man, according to his sub∣stance is a reasonable creature, and received a blessing that he should encrease and multiply by the generation of his species: there is no doubt but from that blessing, he hath also received power to beget a reasonable soule, which is the chiefe part of the species. Which that it should be new created in every man, is not agreeable, seeing God the seventh day ceased from all the workes of his Creation, and then kept the Sabbath.</P>
<P>And there are yet in this inferiour world, the reliques of that matter, of which the celestiall and supercelestiall things were created, so that there is a naturall inclination, and sympathie, of the superiour world, unto the inferiour, and a respect and desire of the inferiour unto the superiour. For from hence also dependeth the proclivitie and cooperation of things superiour, unto the inferiour. The thing most noble, that is in the higher world, is the Empyriall heaven, or those supercelestiall waters, out of which I have shewed the Angels to be created. So that the reasonable soule may be be∣got of the reliques thereof, in this inferiour world: and why may it not, seeing gold which is corruptible, is begot of the farre more grosse and ignoble matter of the earth? Therefore the eternall and immortall soule, may much rather be begot of the reliques of the supercelestiall waters, that it may be like unto Angels, and the blessing and commandement of God gave power to beget the soule of such reliques, to pro∣pagate and multiply the species. Now see what gifts of the holy Ghost or God are in his soule. Here are understanding, reason, judgement, memory, love of what is true∣ly good, justice, joy in the holy Ghost, free election of will, and what else. For in these things he beareth the resemblance of God and his Image, in the immortall sub∣stance of the reasonable soule. For man was created in this order and manner, first he formed the humane shape of <HI>Aphar,</HI> or clay, in which undoubtedly those bowels which are first made in generation begun to be formed, as the heart, then the liver and those things which depend immediately upon the heart: Which being formed he breathed into his face the breath of life. All living things draw breath through the mouth and nostrils, whereby the heart is kindled with life and motion; so through the mouth and nostrils he breathed spirit, which was without question of the reliques of the supercelestiall waters; or some part of them was first conceived in the masse or lumpe
<PB N="46" REF="35"/>
of the body, of which the reasonable soule by the holy Ghost accompanying it, was at length formed: but first the animall life was produced by the common aire. For the reasonable soule; seeing they have different offices the one from the other: and the animall soule going before, the rationall remaineth, and the animall soule is a certaine harmonie, and common operation of the interiour entrals, conspiring to the life of the animall; as for the rationall, it is the Image of the divine essence. But that the animals have obtained life, it commeth to passe undoubtedly by the Spirit of God working with the like blast of aire; although it be not said so, for it is easily understood, that in like things God hath wrought after a like manner. The gifts which the reasonable soule, brought with it, were necessary in man, if he ought to be the Image of God; that he might contemplate the workes of God, and might acknowledge, adore and worship his Creator. For the knowledge of God was required unto the scope of the creation of man; for what blessednesse had he had with God, without the knowledge of him? Seeing therefore he knew the chiefe power and goodnesse of God, and that the con∣templation and familiarity of God was pleasant to him, God would trie him, whe∣ther he that was enriched by him with greatest gifts, whereby he could obey God, would acknowledge and reverence God his Creator: for so bountifull a father requi∣red voluntary and willing obedience and love, whereby to be worshipped, and con∣digne service received from him. He gave him an easie command, that he should not eate of one tree, where there were so many full of the best fruits, for sight and taste, that hee should onely abstaine from that, and it is credible, that he obeyed God a∣while, for as many thinke, he remained not in Paradise one houre, or some dayes or weekes.</P>
<P>It is likely rather that he remained some yeares in the obedience of God, as <HI>George Cedrenus</HI> thinketh, that being sollidly taught the workes of God, by the helpe of the holy Ghost, and longer contemplation, he might declare them to his posteritie: And seeing men then lived long, the true doctrine of God, by the tradition of a few, to wit, three (<HI>Adam, Methusalem,</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI>) came to <HI>Abraham,</HI> by whose holy covenant with God, it was easily preserved in the posteritie of <HI>Iacob,</HI> even unto <HI>Moses.</HI> But ido∣latrie too much prevailing about the time of his birth, God would by the description of the chiefe of his workes by <HI>Moses,</HI> reduce men to the acknowledgement and wor∣ship of one onely God. Here then is propounded to our contemplation, the generation of the world, which he described partly by tradition, and partly by the revelation of the holy Ghost; whereby we may attaine the true and perfect description of the whole world which we seeke for. He had without doubt frequent talke with God, where∣in he was taught concerning the creation, the nature of things, Gods counsell, and o∣ther things, which were necessarie for man to know. God brought to him the living creatures, that he might behold them every one, and give them names according to ther nature; which could not be done in a small space of time. <HI>George Cedrenus</HI> in the abridgement of Histories, saith, some ancients were of opinion, that <HI>Adam</HI> sinned not, nor was cast out of Paradise, untill the seventh yeare, and makes it probable by good reasons.</P>

in vaine, but that the Serpent was a lier, and justly throwne downe from heaven. For it is not to be doubted, but that he had much conversation with God in Paradise, and divers discourses whereby he was instrctued concerning the Creation, and nature, and the end of all things. Yea acknowledged the power of God from so wise a Creation, and the right judgement given against the Serpent, that of right he should not have given eare to the Serpent, and that it was folly for him so to doe: neverthe∣lesse in this he did not sinne against God, because God had not forbidden it. For it made for the greater glory of God, if <HI>Adam</HI> had not sinned: for then had man given a certaine testimonie of himselfe, that he was well created, as all things were very good, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.31. He could have interrupted the serpents speech, and rejected him, and he had not sinned. It was the beginning of sinne, but it was not sinne that he gave eare to Sathan, for God had not forbidden this, and as yet he had power to contradict him: but his longer patience and familiarity caused consent, and he forthwith sinned by transgressing the commandement, wherewith the holy Ghost offended, left him, and spoiled him of his gifts, which he had received in the Creation, and were preser∣ved in him by the holy Ghost, so long as he did not sinne, God considering the event, but not approving it, because he had forbidden it, and <HI>Adam</HI> so making experiment of his constancie. Of this lapse <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> writeth most plainely, and most truely, <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. <HI>verse</HI> 14. God created man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsell, giving him these ordinances and commandements, if thou wilt thou shalt keepe the commandements, and testifie thy good will. He hath set before thee fire and water, put forth thy hand to which thou wilt. Life and death are offered unto man, good and evill, which he pleases shall be given unto him. But now, since God knew before that he would sinne, why did he not create him such a one, as could not fall? God did all things well and like a father. It was his favour that man was adorned with such excellent gifts of minde, that he might easily obey so small a commande∣ment, and man of right ought to have beene thankefull for so great gifts by obeying his Creator. He could therefore as <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> saith, have stood if he would, but that he fell it was not of God predestinating or willing, for God had created all things very good, and Fatherly ordred them. So when he sinned, he was deprived of the holy Ghost, which dwelt before familiarly with him, from whom he had life not mortall, if he had not sinned, who had sustained him in holy life by the grace and fa∣vour of God: being destitute therefore of the familiar presence of the Spirit of God, he perceived nothing in himselfe but carnall affections, whereby his minde being drawne away, (as is evident by <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7.15. and the <HI>verse</HI> following, and 24.) he also was made carnall, that is, addicted to the concupiscence of the flesh, as being constituted in the same subsistence, for he saith, there is another law and necessitie in the flesh, than in the spirit or understanding; and that it draweth the spirit captive in∣to servitude. And that which is captive, is not in its owne power, but is subjected to the power of another. He sheweth then that the spirit in the beginning was not car∣nall but became such when it was made captive to the flesh. It is altogether necessa∣rie to know, and observe this originall of originall sinne, that the spirit from the be∣ginning was not created carnall, or fraile, or unable to resist evils, for this would ar∣gue the impotencie of the Creator, that he could not create man fit for that end which he had conceived, and would violate his authority. Now what calamities are accrew∣ed unto mankinde from this sinne, learne from that place of Saint <HI>Paul, Chap.</HI> 7. for if the flesh could doe so much against the Spirit, adorned with so many abilities, and preserved by the holy Ghost, what shall it not doe against the same spirit made cap∣tive thereunto, and forsaken of the familiaritie of the holy Ghost. Heare what the Apostle saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.12. of all, both Iewes and Gentiles, <HI>They have all gone out of the way, they are all become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one.</HI> He speakes of mans natures alone, but when it is Christ, and man is helped of the holy Ghost, he is not such, the naturall gifts of the minde, understanding, reason, judgement, memory, and other gifts suffice not, if the spirit be not present, the supporter and go∣vernour of these. But the concupiscence of the flesh is not onely a privation of righ∣teousnesse, but a true inclination to those things which please the flesh, from whence all sinnes arise, and therefore that inclination is called originall sinne. Now if it were onely a privation of righteousnesse, <HI>Paul</HI> had no occasion to exclaime: <HI>Wretched man
<PB N="49" REF="36"/>
that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom.</HI> 7. For a regenerate man is freed from his minde. But in the regenerate sinne originall yet abideth, which is an argument, that originall sinne is more then a privation, and an evill which clea∣veth to nature, and is propagated by generation. <HI>In sinne</HI> (saith the <HI>Psalmist) my mo∣ther conceived me.</HI> But God foreseeing that this sinne would come upon man, said, <HI>In that day in which thou shalt eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evill, thou shalt die the death;</HI> for this sinne was to be expiated with the death of the body. Therefore it is a law unto all once to dye, to the end, that that which is come upon them besides the creation, may be abolished in those that are to be saved. As for Paradise, where it was, and what the Rivers thereof, I will shew in the ancient reformed Geography. Man having beene created out of Paradise, was transported into it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the Fabricke of the World. <HI>Of the second and subordinate purpose of the Creator in Creating Man.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ecause God foresaw that Man would sinne, lest so wise a Creation of all things, and the end whereunto it was ordained should be in vaine, which <HI>Adam</HI> violated by sinning, it pleased him therefore to repaire the fall of man, by a new benefit, ordayning a meanes whereby being delivered, he might be restored to his former condition, and that the intent of his first Creation might take effect, he promised his Sonne should take flesh upon him, who should satisfie for the sinne of <HI>Adam,</HI> with which all men were taynted from their birth, that he should appease God the Father, and obtaine the helpe of the Holy Ghost againe, which being promised, and beleeved, they might by the same inten∣tion, as before attaine to eternall life. From this foreknowledge, God using his won∣derfull providence, so finished the Creation of all thing, that in both estates, of o∣bedience, and the fall, he preserved for man the meanes to obtaine eternall life, so that nothing was made of God in vaine, onely the death of the flesh remayned, which was due to originall sinne, untill that was taken away from man altogether, and he being wholly pure, as he was Created, might come to God, according to the end wherefore he was Created.</P>
<P>Moreover, because all men were guilty of orignall sinne, as I shewed in the for∣mer Chapter, so that they could not by the gifts of nature, come unto Christ, God therefore ordayned Repentance, Baptisme, and Communion, the chiefe Sacraments, whereby man before all the world, might yeeld himselfe unto Christ, and by faith might approove and accept his sacrifice for the sinnes of man, whereby he might be armed against the force of sinne, be delivered by this onely meanes, from the power of originall sinne, and obtaine the helpe of the Holy Ghost against the force there∣of, yet the fight with sinne remaineth so long as wee live, till it be abolished by the death of the flesh, on which the originall thereof dependeth, and therefore the death of the flesh was enjoyned of God, because of the fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> that that sinne which is besides the Creation, might be rooted out: by meanes whereof, man is saved, yet is there no accesse unto God the Father, but by Christ. It is written, <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.13. <HI>No man ascendeth up to Heaven, but the Sonne of Man, who descended from Heaven.</HI> The way was to be opened by Christ: And it behooved Christ to suffer, and to enter into his glory, <HI>Luke</HI> 24, 26. That therefore I may adde that which of many is not rightly disputed, before the incarnation of Christ, none of the holy Fathers ascended into Heaven, but were reserved in a certaine place of joy and happy expectation, untill the comming of Christ. This place, the Fathers called <HI>Limbus,</HI> not that of Hell, but as I suppose, that of the Heavenly Paradise, in which <HI>Abraham,</HI> as Father of the faith∣full, was most eminent, into whose bosome or Congregation <HI>Lazarus</HI> after his death was carryed by the Angels. But after the death of Christ they were brought into Hea∣ven, according to his testimony. Father I will that where I am my Servants may be

also. So that Christ Iesus in his time, ascended with his spoyle, and captivity into Heaven. Therefore this originall sinne and fight therewith, continueth unto the death of the flesh; but by faith in Christ we are armed and preserved against it, by the helpe of the Holy Ghost, as <HI>Adam</HI> had beene preserved if he had not sinned. Because of the sight thereof with the Spirit, <HI>Paul</HI> cryeth out <HI>Wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> (to wit, that is assayed thereby) I thanke my God (saith he) by Iesus Christ, whom the Father hath given me for a Saviour, and an Helper by his Spirit, till this sinne be utterly abolished in the death of the flesh.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> What Geographie, the Globe, or the round earth is.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Eography is a discription of the whole Earth, as much as is discovered to us. This Greeke word Geography, is com∣pounded of the Noune <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, instead whereof this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used in composition, that is to say, Earth, and of the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, I write, whence is made this com∣pound word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, a discription of the Earth.</P>
<P>Geography is differing from Cosmography, as the part from the whole, and is also distinguished from Chorogra∣phie, as the whole from the part: for Cosmographie is the discription of all the World, which is derived from the Greeke Noune <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say World, and from the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, I write, when one speakes of the whole world, we understand the world, as well elementary, as Ce∣lestiall.</P>
<P>Corography is the particular description of some Region, or Country, and commeth also from this Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, Region, and from the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is to say, I write, as the discription of <HI>Spaine, Italy, Germany, France; &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Topographie is the particular description of a certaine place, as of a Countrey, of a Territory, or of a Towne, or of a village, under which are comprised Manured Land, Medowes, Trees, Places and buildings, represented by writing. This is also a Greeke word, and compounded of the Noune <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, a place, and of the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, I write.</P>
<P>But Geographie is properly the description of the situation of the Earth alone, where in first is to be marked, that in the terme of Geographie, this word is not onely taken for one of the foure elements, as in a Physicall terme, but thereby we understand con∣joyntly, the earth moistened with the waters, which are showred upon it, making both together the Center of the whole world, which because of the round figure is cal∣led <HI>Orbis,</HI> or the Globe of the Earth. For the Globe is a solid body round on all sides, contained in a Superficies, having in the middle thereof a Center or point, whereof all lines which are drawne from thence, unto the superficies, are equall: this then is a sole Globe, compounded of the one and the other Element, from whence rebounds one onely convex or Superficies, that is to say, which appeareth without concavity.</P>
<P>The Geographers distinguish diversly the Globe of the Earth, into certaine Circles and parts whereof we are to treate in order.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the first place the Axletree is set in the Globe which the Latines call <HI>Axis,</HI> or a right line, which passeth through the Center of the Earth, and is the Diameter of the whole world, called by the Greeke Diameter, compoun∣ded of the preposition <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say <HI>per,</HI> or through, and of the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, I measure: as a measuring through the middle, about which the whole world wheeleth, and turneth about.</P>
<P>The extremities of the Axletree are called the Poles of the world, so called <HI>Poli</HI> from the Greeke verbe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, I turne, whence they are called by the Latins, <HI>vertices,</HI> as turnings and hinges, because all the round frame of the world wheeleth about them, whereof the one of them is called <HI>Arcticus ursalis,</HI> or the Beare-pole, from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; that is to say, a Beare, which is a constellation in Hea∣ven, neere unto this Circle, the other is named <HI>Antarcticus,</HI> because it is right against, and Diametrically opposite to the Pole <HI>Arcticke.</HI></P>
<P>The Pole <HI>Arcticke,</HI> is that which appeareth alwayes in the places, where we inha∣bite, and hath divers names, as <HI>Borealis,</HI> or <HI>Boreas,</HI> and also <HI>Aquilonaris</HI> or <HI>Aquilonius,</HI> from the wind <HI>Boreas,</HI> or <HI>Aquilo</HI> which bloweth from this corner, and is called also <HI>Septentrionalis,</HI> from the seaven Starres, which the Latins call <HI>Triones,</HI> and which are commonly called <HI>Charles Waine.</HI></P>
<P>The Pole <HI>Antarcticke,</HI> is termed also by the Latins, <HI>Australis,</HI> and <HI>Austrinus,</HI> and <HI>Notius,</HI> from the winde called <HI>Auster,</HI> and <HI>Notus,</HI> and <HI>Meridionalis,</HI> which is the Southerne windes, taking the name from that Region of the world, and is never seene in this our Hemisphere, but lies hid under the <HI>Horizon.</HI> Moreover, the Globe of the earth is accompanied with eight principall Circles, doubly divided. First, into an equall number, the greater and lesser: the greater are these which have the same Center as the world hath, and which cut and divide the Globe, or the Sphere into two equal parts. They are called in this manner <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> or <HI>Aequator, Zodiaque, Hori∣zon, Meridian.</HI> The lesser circles are those, which have a different Center, and o∣ther then that of the Globe, or of the Sphere, and part the Sphere or Globe into two equall parts. These are the two Tropickes, and the two <HI>Polars,</HI> or the Poles of the world.</P>
<P>Againe among all these aforesaid Circles, some of them are termed, Rights, or Parallels, that is to say distances, which have an equall space the one from the other, because they have the same Poles, as the world hath, and in regard that they are of an equall distance among themselves in <HI>Latitude.</HI> These are called the <HI>Aequator,</HI> the two <HI>Tropickes,</HI> and the two <HI>Polars,</HI> the other three called <HI>Oblique,</HI> or <HI>byassing,</HI> because they have their Poles differing from the Poles of the world.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the foure great Circles.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hese great Circles are distinguished into fixed, and mooveable. The fixed. immoveable are those, which alwayes hold one and the same place in the Globe, or in the Sphere, and hence it comes, that they are pointed out upon the superficies or upper face of the Globe. These are the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and the <HI>Zodiaque.</HI> The moveable are those, which are not alwayes set∣led in one place, but change their place diversly, and according to the variety, and change of places and Countries, and for this cause are placed, without the Superficies of the Sphere, these are they which are named <HI>Horizon,</HI> and <HI>Meridian,</HI> but it beho∣veth us to speake of each of them in particular.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Horizon,</HI> by the Latins is called <HI>Terminator, Finitor,</HI> and <HI>Finiens,</HI> a <HI>Bounder.</HI> a <HI>Finiter,</HI> or Finishing, which is a great Circle, moveable, which separateth the vi∣sible
<PB N="51" REF="38"/>
part of the world from the invisible, that is to say, the inferiour Hemisphere from the Superiour. It is very well represented upon the covercle or upon the upper face of the Globe, for the superficies thereof, which is the upper part, maketh the true office of the <HI>Horizon,</HI> when it divideth the whole Globe into two equall parts. Now the said <HI>Horizon</HI> is of two sorts; the one which is conceived by reason, and under∣standing, the other, which is knowne by the sense. That which is comprehended by the Intellect hath it extention unto the Sphere of the fixed Starres, and divideth into two equall parts, the whole Globe of the world, so that one of these Hemispheres ap∣peareth above the Earth, and the other is hidden under the earth, and is divided againe into two sorts, the one right, the other oblique; the right is that which passeth a thwart from the two Poles of the world, hath its Pole, or point verticall under the <HI>Aequator,</HI> which cutteth betweene them in forme of right angles. The oblique is called that, whose pole, or point verticall meeteth either on this side, or that side of the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and cutteth the <HI>Aequator</HI> by oblique angles. The one being elevated on high from the Poles of the world, the other altogether declining downeward. Those which have this <HI>Horizon,</HI> perceive the rising, and the setting of the Sunne, and of the other Starres by oblique motion. But the <HI>Horizon</HI> we know by sense, is that which being bounded and terminated by our sight, extendeth as farre as our sight can pearce, separating the visible part of the Globe, from that which is invisible, the Diameter whereof, is a hundred and fourescore furlongs in length, that is to say, two and twenty thousand paces, and a halfe, or five thousand of <HI>Germane,</HI> with the five eight parts. And is thought that it passeth no further; because that our sight cannot extend any further. The <HI>Horizon</HI> is called moveable or divers, because one cannot change the place, to any place whithersoever he goeth, besides, if one move out of his place never so little, which wayes he will, even in that instant he changeth also the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the Heaven, and the Region, and by this meanes one may imagine an in∣finity of <HI>Horizons.</HI> It is likewise to be knowne, that the <HI>Horizon</HI> hath two Poles, whereof one of them in the <HI>Arabicke</HI> tongue, is called <HI>Semith,</HI> and by the vulgar cor∣rupted, <HI>Zenith,</HI> and is no other thing, than a point which is right over the crowne of our heads, the other is commonly called <HI>Nadir,</HI> but to speake more properly <HI>Na∣thir,</HI> Diametrically opposite to the other, and is right over the head of the <HI>An∣tipodes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Equinoctiall</HI> is a word borrowed from the Latine <HI>Aequinoctialis,</HI> which is also cal∣led <HI>Aequidialis,</HI> and in Greeke, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from the word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, alike, and from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, day, and besides is tearmed by the Latins <HI>Aequator.</HI> This is a Circle of the Sphere, the greatest of the five Parallels, and which divideth the Globe into two equall parts, the <HI>Septentrionall,</HI> and the <HI>Meridionall,</HI> distant by an equall space from the two Poles, whereunto, when the Sunne is once come, it maketh through the whole world, the night and the day of an equall length and du∣rance, whence likewise it taketh the name of <HI>Aequidiall,</HI> and <HI>Aequinoctiall.</HI> The <HI>Aequinoxe,</HI> or <HI>Aequidiall,</HI> as the ancients call them, happen twice a yeare, the one in the beginning of the signe <HI>Aries,</HI> or the Ramme, which is called vernall, and the other in the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> or the Ballance, called Autumne. But Navigators commonly call the <HI>Equator,</HI> the middle line, or simply the Line, by a certaine Empha∣sis, or by prerogative and excellency.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zodiaque</HI> is one of the greatest Circles of the Sphere, placed crosse-wise be∣tweene the two Poles of the world, which toucheth with the one side the estivall <HI>Tropicke,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Cancer,</HI> or of the Crab, and with the other the Hyemall <HI>Tropicke,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Capricorne,</HI> cutting the <HI>Aequator</HI> in the middle, and is likewise by the same <HI>Aequator,</HI> cut in the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and <HI>Libra,</HI> so that the one halfe thereof boweth towards the Pole <HI>Arctique,</HI> and the other on that part of the Pole <HI>Antarctique:</HI> it is divided into twelve parts, which are cōmonly called the twelve signes, from whence commeth the Latine word <HI>Signifer,</HI> that is to say, Signe-bearer, and the Greeke <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from the Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, Animal, or Beast; because there are represented in it the twelve signes of living Creatures, the names whereof, the Poet <HI>Ausoinus</HI> hath comprised in this Distique.</P>

The tropicke of <HI>Cancer,</HI> or the Crab, which is also called Estivall, is nearest to the North among all the circles, through the which the Sunne maketh his course; to which when it commeth, it goeth no further towards the North, but returnes againe to the other part of the world, towards the South, taking againe his Estivall course, in which time, the dayes are at the longest of all the yeare in our Hemisphere, and the nights the shortest: and this name, the tropicke of <HI>Cancer</HI> was given to it, from the signe <HI>Cancer,</HI> or the Crab, which is in the Zodiaque, instantly, whereupon, the Sunne beginneth to returne. The tropicke of <HI>Capricorne,</HI> which is called also Hybernall, is the circle nearest to the South of all other, thorow the middle whereof the Sunne passeth, whereunto the Sunne being once come, goeth no further toward the Meridio∣nall part, but makes his returne in the Winter towards the Septentrionall part, which makes us to have the longest nights of all the yeare, and shortest dayes. It is called the tropicke of <HI>Capricorne</HI> from this signe, when the Sunne comes to passe it.</P>
<P>There are two polare circles farthest of all, and next neighboures to the Poles, being equally distant from their Poles, whereof the one of them, is that which we alwayes see, and is called <HI>Arctique,</HI> as the Pole it selfe is, from the Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, Beare; because it is marked neare the feete. with the little Beare: it is called

<P>The <HI>Zones</HI> receive sundrie denominations, according to the qualitie and the nature of their situations; the one is called the Torride, or burning Zone, the two others are called cold, and somewhat temperate: that which lies in the middest betweene the foure others is called the Torride, because of the heate of the Sunne, which is perpe∣tually hot and burning in this place, over which he passeth, and the way through which it goeth, for which reason the ancients thought it unhabitable.</P>
<P>This then is the Torride zone, which is a space of place situated, betweene the two Tropickes, which containeth 47. degrees in latitude, and over which the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> circle that cutteth it, and divideth it in the middle is situated. The two others, which are situated in the extremities of the Globe, next to the Poles of the world whereof the one of them lieth next the Pole <HI>Arctique,</HI> and the Northerne part, and the other towards the Pole <HI>Antarctique,</HI> on the other side of the South, are called <HI>friged</HI> or cold, because they are extreamely distant from the course and way which the Sun holdeth, and for this cause, by reason of the extremitie of the cold, the ancients held them not habitable. Their bounds are limited one from another by their proper Pole, and are also called Polars from the said Poles, touching their extention in latitude, it is three and twentie degrees and a halfe.</P>
<P>The other two Zones remaining are called temperate, and accounted habitable, be∣cause they are placed betweene the cold and the hot, and participate of the tempera∣ture of them both; the one whereof is called Septentrionall, shut in betweene the circle Articke, and the tropicke of <HI>Cancer,</HI> or the Crab: the other is called Australl or Meridionall, bounded with the circle <HI>Antarctique,</HI> and the Tropicke of <HI>Capricorne,</HI> both which containe 43. degrees.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Parallels, and Climats.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is another way also to divide the superficies of the earth, to wit, by the change and the diversitie of the length of dayes, for those who inhabit right under the <HI>Equator,</HI> have perpetually the day and night of an equall length, just twelve houres long, but as much as is gained on this side, or on the other side of the <HI>Equator,</HI> lying towards the one, or the other Pole: So much in Summer the dayes encrease in length, and on the other side the nights are made the longer in Winter; for this cause the Geographers, according to the encreasing of the dayes, have diversely distinguished the regions, or parts of the earth, which they call Parallels, or Climats.</P>
<P>Parallels are circles equally distant one from another drawne from the West to the East, any man may see them at his pleasure, delineated upon the Globe of the earth. But <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> who was followed by a great number of other Geographers, hath made twentie one Parallels, in that part which extends it selfe twards the North, keeping
<PB N="54" REF="41"/>
this proportion, and internall; so that one of the longest dayes of a parallell surpasseth the longest day of the parallell precedent. The climate is a space of the earth, between two parallels, in which on the longest day it maketh the change, or encrease of halfe an houre. But the word climate and and parallell signifie sometimes a space, comprehen∣ded betweene two circles.</P>
<P>Moreover the climats are distinguished into those, which are Septentrionals, and the Meridionalls, either of them taking their beginning from the <HI>Equator,</HI> extending towards their proper Pole. Hence it comes to passe, that where the climate lieth fur∣thest from the <HI>Equator,</HI> so many halfe houres, the longest day exceedeth the day e∣quall to the night, to wit, which is twelve houres, and going backward giveth you to understand, under what parallell, or climate every place is situated, you are to marke well the number of houres, of which the longest day in the same place, exceedeth the day of the right sphere (which as is said) is alwayes twelve houres; for this number being doubled, sheweth the number of the Climates, and being quadruple, giveth you to understand the number of the parallel.</P>
<P>Moreover, antiquitie knew onely but seaven Climates, being of opinion, that that which was beyond the seventh climate, could hardly be accounted habitable, being not as yet discovered.</P>
<P>These climates tooke their denominations from the most renowned places, over which the middle place of the climates extended, namely, the first was called <HI>per Me∣roen</HI> or <HI>dia Meroes,</HI> which was an Ile lying upon the river of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and a city in <HI>Africa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> The second, <HI>per Sienem,</HI> a towne of <HI>Egypt.</HI> The fourth, <HI>per Rhodum,</HI> or <HI>dia Rhodes,</HI> an Iland well knowne. The fifth, <HI>per Romam,</HI> or <HI>dia Romes.</HI> The sixth, <HI>per Pontum Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inum,</HI> or <HI>dia Ponton.</HI> The seventh, <HI>per Boryst henem</HI> or <HI>dia Borysthenes:</HI> some others adde unto them two more, that is, <HI>per Ripheos,</HI> the eight, and <HI>per Damam</HI> the ninth. But our mo∣derne Authors, who have found out by experience, that the earth was inhabited be∣yond these above said climates, have supposed five and twentie climates, reaching o∣ver the 67. degree of the elevation of the Pole; the first was over <HI>Meroes,</HI> the second over <HI>Syena</HI> under the Estiuall tropicke, the third over <HI>Alexandrino,</HI> the fourth over <HI>Rhodes,</HI> the fifth over <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Hellespont,</HI> the sixt over <HI>Millan</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> the seventh over <HI>Podolia</HI> and <HI>Tartaria</HI> the lesser, the eighth over <HI>Wittenberge,</HI> the ninth over <HI>Rostocke,</HI> the tenth over <HI>Ireland,</HI> the eleventh over <HI>Bohoja</HI> a fortresse in <HI>Norway,</HI> the twelfth over <HI>Gutie,</HI> the thirteenth over <HI>Bergin</HI> a towne in <HI>Norway,</HI> the foureteenth o∣ver <HI>Viburgh</HI> a towne in <HI>Finland,</HI> the fifteenth over <HI>Arotia</HI> a towne of <HI>Sweatbland,</HI> the sixteenth over the mouth of the river of <HI>Dalenkaul,</HI> and the other which remaine over the other places of <HI>Norway, Sweathland, Russia,</HI> and the places bordering upon the next Iles by the like internall. Now it is certaine that from the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> circle, to the place where the longest day is limited to twentie foure houres, it hath the exten∣sion of twentie foure climates, but from this place to the Pole, the climates cannot be certainely distinguished; because that from thence afterward the dayes encrease in such a sort, first not by halfe houres, but from the beginning by whole dayes: after by weekes, and in time by moneths, so that under the Poles, one of the Hemispheres is enlightned and dried by the light of the dayes, which last sixe moneths: the other by the like space of time, is overcast with a thicke darkenesse and a continuall night.</P>
<P>For the rest the same consideration, which hath beene made of the climates from the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> towards the Pole <HI>Arctique,</HI> the like also must be observed from the same <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> on that side, which lieth towards the Pole <HI>Antarctique,</HI> in making alike number of them, neverthelesse, the Authors have given no other proper appellations to such climes, but named them by those which were opposite to them, adding this Greeke preposition <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to them, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, opposite to that which is over against <HI>Meroe,</HI> and so of the others, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is opposite to that which passeth over <HI>Syena,</HI> notwithstanding, a man may call them by the same proper name, as the others: as the first Climate, by the mountaines of the Moone, and the sources of <HI>Nilus;</HI> the second, by the Promontory commonly called <HI>Cabo de Corientes,</HI> under the <HI>Hybernall</HI> tropicke, and so of others: but for the more easie conceiving of the latitude of the Climates and Parallels from the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> the distances of the one from the other, and the length of the longest dayes, we have prefixed this follow∣ing Table.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the division of the earth into three hundred and sixtie degrees, with the Longitude and Latitude thereof.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE circumference and roundnesse of the whole circle, according to the Geometritians, is divided into 360. parts, and this same division is re∣ceived into the section of the Sphere and of the Globe. The earth then, as the sphere is divided into 360. parts which they call degrees. Every de∣gree is divided into 60. scruples, which make a thousand <HI>Romane</HI> spaces, or an <HI>Italian</HI> mile, or an ordinary <HI>Almaine</HI> mile: so that every degree containeth 15. <HI>Germaine</HI> miles, and the whole counted together, make five thousand and foure hun∣dred: which is the whole circumference of all the Globe of the earth: and its Diame∣ter, or the halfe part thereof equally in two, is a thousand seven hundred and eigh∣teene <HI>Germane</HI> miles, with two elevenths: the semi-diameter, from the superficies of the center, eight hundred fiftie nine, with one eleventh.</P>
<P>Moreover, the degrees by which the earth is measured, are of two sorts, the one of Longitude, the other of Latitude. The longitudes are distinguished by the Meridian circles, and the Latitudes by the Parallels. There are thirtie sixe Meridians, which are fastned upon the Globe, every Meridian having tenne degrees, which number being multiplied, maketh three hundred &amp; sixty <HI>Ptolomy</HI> hath placed the first Meridian in the fortunate Iles, which at this day are called the <HI>Canaries,</HI> since the <HI>Spanish</HI> Pylots have placed it in the Ile of Gos-hawkes, which their language is called <HI>Assores,</HI> and some of them placed it in the midst of <HI>Spaine.</HI> From the <HI>Equator</HI> to the one or the other Pole, are marked out nine Parallels, each of them containing tenne degrees: then multiply∣ing this number by foure, ye shall finde in all thirtie sixe parallels, as in the Longitude: Now wee must hold that the Longitude is a certaine space or internall of the <HI>Equator,</HI> closed betweene Meridians, the one from the Iles called <HI>Assores,</HI> from whence it taketh the beginning, the other from that place or Region, whereof we would know the distance. As touching the breadth or elevation, that is, a going backeward, or the length of a place or of a Countrey distant from the <HI>Equator,</HI> either towards the one or the other Pole. Also the elevation of the Pole is the same as is the Latitude from a place. But this Latitude is of two sorts, the one is Septentrionall from the <HI>Equator,</HI> to the Pole <HI>Arctque</HI> in our Hemisphere; the other is Meridionall or <HI>Austral,</HI> from the <HI>E∣quator</HI> in the inferiour Hemisphere to the Pole <HI>Antarctique.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Romanes</HI> measured the distance of places by the number of a thousand paces, which they called <HI>milliare,</HI> and because they marched every space of a thousand paces with a stone: thence they called their miles, or <HI>milliaries, lapides.</HI> As for example, when they said, <HI>ad decimum lapidem,</HI> that was, <HI>ad decimum milliare,</HI> ten thousand paces, or the tenth <HI>milliar.</HI> Foure thousand paces make a common <HI>Germane</HI> mile, hence it is that one degree of the Globe of the earth, containeth sixtie thousand paces, miles, or <HI>Italian</HI> milliers, but are fifteene thousand ordinary <HI>German</HI> miles. The <HI>Grecians</HI> measured the distances of places by furlongs, the furlong is an hundred twentie five paces, whereof eight furlongs make an <HI>Italian</HI> mile, that is a thousand paces; and two and thirty furlongs make an ordinary <HI>Germaine</HI> mile. The <HI>Persians</HI> measured the length of their lands by that which they called <HI>Parasanga,</HI> every one of them containing 30. furlongs.

<HEAD>The Preface upon ATLAS.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>TLAS</HI> King of Mauritania, was borne of a Royall race, and had for his father <HI>Serrenus,</HI> or <HI>Indigena</HI> (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> witnesseth out of the most ancient Historians) whose surname was <HI>Coelus,</HI> and whose mother was <HI>Titea,</HI> surnamed <HI>Terra;</HI> his great Grand∣father on the fathers and mothers side was <HI>Elius</HI> or <HI>Sol,</HI> King of Phoenice, who with his wife <HI>Beruth,</HI> dwelt in Biblius, both of them excellently versed in Astronomy, and in natural disciplines, so that for their learning sake, they were accounted worthy of the names of <HI>Sol</HI> and of <HI>Coelum;</HI> undoubtedly this <HI>Atlas,</HI> as the Ancients report (namely <HI>Diodorus</HI> in his fourth Booke and fifth Chapter) was a most skilfull Astrologer, and the first among men that disputed of the Sphaere. He had many brethren to the number of fortie five, whom <HI>Coelus</HI> begat of divers women, whereof <HI>17.</HI> of them he had by <HI>Titea,</HI> a most prudent Matron, that did many good offices to men, whom he after their mothers name called <HI>Titanes.</HI> Hee had also sisters, among whom the principall were <HI>Basilea,</HI> who in favour of her mother, brought up all her brethren, and there∣fore they called her Grandmother, and <HI>Rea Pandora.</HI> Now after the decease of <HI>Coelus, Basi∣lea</HI> being the eldest, and excelling the others in prudence and vertue, by the common consent of her brethren and the people being a Virgine and unmarried, shee obtained the kingdome. Afterwards being desirous to leave an heire behind her, she was married to her brother <HI>Hy∣perion,</HI> and she bare him two children, to wit, <HI>Sol</HI> and <HI>Luna,</HI> whose prudence <HI>Hyperions</HI> bre∣thren admiring to the intent the kingdome might not be setled upon his issue, they massacred him, and drowned <HI>Sol</HI> his Sonne, being yet an infant in the River of <HI>Eridanus.</HI> Then the Sonnes of <HI>Coelus</HI> whereof the noblest of them were <HI>Atlas,</HI> and <HI>Saturnus,</HI> shared their Fathers kingdome, betweene them. <HI>Atlas</HI> had for his part, those Countries, which lay next unto the Ocean, and <HI>Lybia,</HI> and the straights of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> whence <HI>Mount-Atlas,</HI> and the Atlanticke people in <HI>Mauritania</HI> tooke first their name, and <HI>Saturnus</HI> obtained <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> who being afterward hated of his people, for the crueltie he used against his father <HI>Coelus,</HI> fled in∣to <HI>Italy,</HI> where by <HI>Ianus</HI> he was made partaker ef the kingdome. Now for as much as <HI>Dio∣dorus</HI> alleageth, that <HI>Coelus</HI> was the first King that reigned amongst the Atlantickes, the people being before dispersed up and downe in fields in <HI>Colonies,</HI> he admonished them, to gather themselves together, and to build Townes. Without all question these Kings were very an∣cient, because <HI>Atlas,</HI> sonne of <HI>Atlas,</HI> having chased away his brother, <HI>Hesperus</HI> was King of <HI>Iberia,</HI> which afterwards in the yeare <HI>738,</HI> after the universall floud was called <HI>Spaine. Hesperus</HI> flying into <HI>Etruria,</HI> where he was made tutour to <HI>Ianus.</HI> The Grandfather of <HI>A∣tlas (Elias)</HI> reigned in <HI>Phoenice,</HI> anno <HI>662.</HI> after the deluge. And <HI>Diodorus</HI> witnesseth, that those Kings out of the nature of things, and the contemplation of them, attained to excellent knowledge, and withall became pious, and more humane, that as <HI>Diodorus</HI> truely saith, the <HI>Atlantiks</HI> bore away the Bell for their pietie, and humanity to strangers, from all o∣ther Nations whatsoever, when there were scarcely not above <HI>22.</HI> or <HI>23.</HI> generations com∣pleate, and many parts of the earth not yet inhabited. <HI>Atlas</HI> had many sonnes, but among the rest, one famous for his piety, justice, and courtesie to his subjects. His name was Hesperus, who ascending up to the top of mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> to search out diligently the courses of the starres, was on a sudaine violently carried away with winde, and appeared no more. So much <HI>Diodorus</HI> speaketh of him: but in my opinion (as I have said) I find he was King in <HI>Iberia,</HI> into which at last, he came with a prosperous winde, where he lived so prudently, and religiously, that when he fled into <HI>Etruria,</HI> being driven from thence by his brother, for his excellent wisedome and prudence, he was made Tutor to <HI>Ianus,</HI> and administrator of the King∣dome, which offices <HI>Atlas</HI> his brother undertooke. My purpose then is to follow this <HI>Atlas,</HI> a man so excelling in erudition, humanity, and wisedome (as from a loftie watch tower) to con∣template Cosmography, as much as my strength and ability will permit me, to see if perad∣venture by my diligence, I may finde out some truths in things yet unknowne, which may serve to the study of wisedome. And as the world containeth the number of all things, the species, order, harmony, proportion, vertues and effects; so beginning from the Creation, I wil number al the parts thereof, so far as methodical reason requireth, according to the order of the creation, and will contemplate physically, that the causes of things may be knowne, where∣of consisteth that science of sciences wisedome, which directeth every good thing to a good end,
<PB REF="46"/>
by a provident wisedome, which doth facilitate the way to the ends. This is the maine scope I aime at. Afterward J will handle coelestiall things in their ranke: then the Astronomicks; which appertaine to conjecture by the Starres. Fourthly, treate of things Elementary, and lastly, the Geographicks, and so as (in a mirrour) will set before your eyes, the whole world, that in making use of some rudiments, ye may find out the causes of things, and so by attai∣ning unto wisedome and prudence, by this meanes leade the Reader to high speculations.</P>

<HEAD>THE TYPE OF THE GLOBE OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas by the Necessitie of Nature, Order doth alwayes require, that Univer∣sals should bee set before Parriculars, and the Whole before the Part, for the better understanding of the present Matter: I also, being bound by this Law, ought to set be∣fore this first Volume of our <HI>Geographie,</HI> an universall Type of the Globe of the Earth; and of the foure Parts thereof, <HI>Eu∣rope, Africk, Asia,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> that so I may more happily follow my intended matter: and also, that in the severall following Tomes hereafter, he that shall desire to have the Delineation of his owne Country, may have a perfect Worke before him, being not deprived of this so profitable a speculation. For the contemplation of Generals is pleasant, and very necessary to him, who desireth to have the least knowledge of the World and naturall things. For if you please to consider the manner of the rising and setting of the Sunne, what is the cause of Summer or Winter, whence is the inequality of the Dayes and Nights, or lastly, what hath beene the originals, or propagations of things, what hath beene the actions, the atchievements, the mutations, and conversions happening in any place, even from the first Creation, you shall learne all this no where better, than out of these five adjoyning Tables, with∣out all danger, and with honest recreation of minde. And even as it is not sufficient for any one, though hee have a large dwelling-place, to know the severall parts of his house, as the Porch, the Wine-cellar, and Butterie, the Kitchin, the Parlour, the Supping-roome, the Bed cham∣ber, the Closet, the Studie, &amp;c. whereby hee may use them conveni∣ently; but also it is fit and necessary, that hee should know, in what part and street of the Citie his house standeth, and thence hee may straight∣way discerne, if any fire or tumult happen in the Citie, how neare or
<PB N="2" REF="47"/>
how farre he is from danger: So it is no lesse necessary to know in what part of the world thou dwellest, what people are neare thee, and which are farther off, that when warre approacheth, thou mayst know when to feare, and when to be quiet in minde. Lastly, though <HI>Cosmographie</HI> be the light of all Ecclesiasticall and Politicall Historie, and that the be∣holder may learne more from thence, than the Traveller by his long, tedious and chargeable labour, who often changeth his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Caelum non animum mu∣tant qui trans mare currunt. <HI>Horat.</HI></NOTE> Climate, onely, but not his condition; yet you shall receive little benefit there∣by, if you doe not joyne the Generall Tables to the Particular. Now these Generall Tables are gathered out of the great description of the Globe of the Earth (whose beginning of Longitude, or position of the first <HI>Meridian</HI> wee have followed in every one of them) and out of my great <HI>Europa,</HI> which I published at <HI>Duysburg.</HI> In the meane time, Rea∣der farewell, and enjoy this worke, and diligently consider with the Poet <HI>Buchanan,</HI> the glory of this thy habitation granted unto thee only for a time, who doth so compare it with the heavens, that he may there∣by lift up those mindes which are drowned in these earthly and transi∣tory things, and shew them the way to more high and Eternall mat∣ters.</P>
<Q><L>How small a part that is, thou mayst perceive</L>

<L>And these with deepe gulfes drowne the world again,</L>

And <HI>Apuleius</HI> painting forth an admirable picture of it calleth it, That which consists in the societie of heaven and earth, and of those things which belong unto their natures. The same <HI>Apuleius</HI> more elaborately describes the world thus; or to this purpose. The world (saith hee) is a garnished ordinance of things, the just charge and custodie of the Gods, whose pole, (for so I call the Cen∣ter) beeing strong and immoveable, passeth through the earth, the Mo∣ther and nourisher of all living creatures. All the higher parts, as may be seene, being enclosed and hidden with the moistnesse of the aire in manner of a covering: Beyond is the house of the Gods, called Heaven, which wee see is full of divine bodies, as the faire and shining lights of the Sunne, Moone, and the other Starres, with which it is carried about by the diurnall and nocturnall motion in such a perpetuall course, as shall never have an end. Now that the forme thereof is gathered round together like a Globe, the name thereof doth declare, and the consent of men calling and painting it in manner of a Globe; besides diverse arguments that prove the same: As because such a figure is most capable, most simple, and doth bend in all parts towards it selfe, sustaines it selfe, includes and containes it selfe, wanting no joyning together, nor having any end or beginning in any of its parts: as also because where∣soever you behold it, it hath a circular forme in all its parts, which can∣not happen in another figure.

corruption, and containeth not onely simple Bodies, as Fire, Aire, Wa∣ter, Earth: but also those which are compounded of them, whereof wise men have delivered five kindes. For some are imperfectly mixt, which we call Meteors, as Hayle, Raine, Snow, Thunder, Lightning, Winde; others perfectly mixt, but without life, as Stones, Mettalls, &amp;c. There are others which have a vegetable soule, as Plants; and those which have a sensible soule, as Brute Creatures: Lastly, there are some in the highest and last degree of compound things, which beside all these have a reasonable soule, as Men. We, leaving those things which belong to Astronomers and Philosophers, will chiefly consider the Globe of the Earth. The whole Earth being diversly divided by Seas, Rivers, and Marshes, doth make altogether an absolute Globe. <HI>Homer</HI> for no other cause calleth it Orbicular.

And (that I may passe over the publicke furie of nations) this is it in which we drive forth our bordering neighbours, and by stealth encroach upon their Country, so that hee that hath most enlarged his territories, and driven the adjoyning inhabitants from their bounds, in how small a part of earth doth he rejoyce? or when hee hath enlarg'd it to the measure of his owne covetousnesse, what portion doth hee ob∣taine for all his labour?</HI> Thus farre <HI>Plinie.</HI> And let this suffice concerning the earth as it does make one Globe with the Sea.

The Tide is said to be a mo∣tion of the Sea, wherby it floweth upward, &amp; having finished his course, ebbeth backe againe. As there is one cause thereof so there are many e∣vents and effects concerning it. For in some places there is little or no Tide at all.

But concerning them we will speake more in another place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The commo∣dities of the Sea.</NOTE> The Sea is not altogether barren, but bringeth forth Fish, Plants, and pretious stones, and it is to be noted how Nature, with <HI>Dedalus</HI> cunning, hath re∣presented in the Sea all the chiefest things which are seene either on the Earth, or in the Aire. I let passe the Sea-Elephants, the Sea-Hogges, the Torteises, Dog-fishes, Sea-calves, Sea-horses: I omit the Falcons and Sea-swallowes, seeing Nature hath exprest even man himselfe, in the Mairman, in the Siren, and Nereides: and also in the Monke-fish: as for the Corrall, the Pearles, the Amber, Gumme, Sponges, and infinite other things. Whom do they not worthily draw into the admiration and a∣doration of Gods power? But of this wee have spoken sufficiently. Let us come now to the distribution of the Globe of the Earth. The Ancients have divided the Globe of the Earth sometimes into two parts, some∣times into three: the division into three parts, <HI>Europe, Asia, Africke,</HI> or <HI>Libya,</HI> is most famous among the Ancients, to whom the new World was not yet knowne. But <HI>America</HI> being found, our age hath added that for the fourth part.

I passe now to the publicke workes, which have beene heretofore very stately and magnificent, and worthy to bee numbred among the seaven Miracles of the World. Amongst them the first were the walls of <HI>Babylon,</HI> which<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Iustin. Hist. lib. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Semiramis</HI> built, or at least did repaire being ruinate, with brickes joyned and laid in a pitchy kind of mortar, they were two hundred foot high and fiftie broade, so that Chariots might meet thereon; they had three hundred Towers, and should have had more, but that in some parts the Marshes were insteed of walls. It is reported that for this so great a worke three hundred thousand workemen were employed. <HI>Herodotus</HI> reporteth, that the walls of <HI>Babylon</HI> were fiftie royall cubits thicke, and two hundred high, and round about there were placed in them a hundred brazen Gates. The second was the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> which was built by all <HI>Asia</HI> in two hundred and twenty yeares, as Histories doe testifie: And it was seated in a Moorish place, least it should be endangered by Earth∣quakes; And least they should place the foundation of so great a buil∣ding

upon unfirme ground, they strewed it over with coales trodden downe, and on it they laid fleeces of wooll. The length of the Temple was 425. feet, the breadth 220. The Pillars in it were an hundred and seaven and twenty, all made by severall Kings, of which 36. were car∣ved: <HI>Ctesiphon</HI> was the overseer of the worke. There was also a Monu∣ment which <HI>Artemesia</HI> Queene of <HI>Caria</HI> did erect in memory of her de∣ceased husband, which is to bee counted among the wonders of the World; it being 25. Cubits high, and compassed about with thirty Pil∣lars: it was sixe and thirty foote wide Northward and Southward. Lastly, there was that magnificent Temple, which <HI>Salomon</HI> began to build in the fourth yeare of his raigne, not unfit to be reckoned with the seaven wonders of the World. First of all,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Read 1. King. chap. 5. and 6.</NOTE> thirty thousand men were set to cut trees, as <HI>Cedars</HI> and <HI>Cypresse</HI> in <HI>Lebanon:</HI> and there were fourescore thousand stone-cutters. The bredth of the Temple was twenty Cubits, the length sixtie, and the height an hundred and twen∣ty. The matter of the nethermost building was of white stone: the largenesse of the Porch was ten Cubits, there were twenty secret cham∣bers, passing one into another, and others placed under these. The beames were of <HI>Cedar,</HI> the roofes of <HI>Cedar</HI> guilded over, and the walls in like manner: The Sanctuary of the Holy place was distinguished from the body of the Temple with a wall, in which were carved gates, with drawing Curtaines enterwoven with many flowers and winding borders: besides two Cherubins of pure gold, the pavement under foot was beset with studdes of gold: the gates were twenty Cubits in height, and twelve in compasse. There was a brazen vessell of so great a big∣nesse, that it was fitly called the Sea; round about which stood twelve Calves, three together, and looking severally toward the foure corners of the World. This vessell did hold three thousand measures contain∣ing 72. Sextaries. There were also other figures, which it would be too long to rehearse. There was a brazen Altar of ten foot height, &amp; double as much in length. Also one golden Table, and ten thousand golden Pots and Dishes, &amp;c.

The terme of its Latitude towards the South, is the Straits of <HI>Magellane,</HI> that is, under the degree 52. and towards the North, it is not knowne high∣er then 67. It hath therefore on the East the <HI>Atlanticke</HI> Sea, which they commonly call <HI>Del Nort,</HI> on the South, the Southerne Land of <HI>Magel∣lane,</HI> disjoyned from it by a narrow Sea flowing betweene: on the West, <HI>Mare Pacificum,</HI> or the <HI>Peaceable</HI> Sea, called <HI>Mare Del Zur;</HI> and on the North it is doubtfull whether there bee Land or Sea. The whole compasse in sayling round about it, is about 32000 miles, as the most approved thinke. For it hath beene sayled round about, except that Country which lyeth Northward, whose coasts are not yet discovered. The whole Country is changeable and full of varietie; at first it wan∣ted both Corne and Wine: but instead thereof it bringeth forth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Read <HI>Heylin. pag.</HI> 770.</NOTE> <HI>MatZ,</HI> a kinde of pulse, for so they call it; as they call Wine <HI>Chichia,</HI> boates <HI>Canoas,</HI> their Princes <HI>Cacicos.</HI> They do not plough the ground to reape, but having digged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renches of a small depth, they put three or foure granes in one of them, and so cover them with earth. The severall stalkes doe beare three or foure eares, and every one of the eares doe beare three or foure hundred graines and more. The stalke of <HI>Mayz</HI> doth exceed the height of a man, and in some Countries it is gathered twice in a yeare. They have also another kinde of bread, beside that which they make of <HI>Maiz,</HI> which they call<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Cassader.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cazabi.</HI> This is made of <HI>Iucca,</HI> which is a roote of the bignesse of a Turnep, which sendeth forth no seed, but certaine knottie, hard stalkes, cloathed with greene leaves like Hempe. Those stalkes when they are ripe, they cut into peeces of two hands length, which they bury in heapes under the earth; and as oft as they would make that kinde of bread, they digge up of them as much as they thinke good, because they will soone be corrupted and grow naught. Moreover, there are two other kindes of rootes, the one they call the<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Potatoes.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Battata,</HI> the other the <HI>Haia,</HI> almost alike in shape, but that the <HI>Haiae</HI> are lesse and more savory: they eate the fruite of them within sixe Moneths after they are planted, which though they have a kinde

of sweet taste, yet such as will soone cloy one; beside, they have but little juyce, and doe procure winde in the stomacke. Those Countries have also a great number of trees, which doe bring forth wilde Grapes. Their Grapes are like Sloes which grow upon thornes and bushes, and are covered with blacke leaves: but because they are more woody then juycie, therefore the inhabitants doe not make wine of them. There are in this Country Trees bearing Olives, but such as are of an unpleasant smell, and of a worse taste: and diverse other kindes of fruits in great abundance, as those which they call <HI>Hovi, Platani, Pineae, Guiavae, Ma∣mei,</HI> and <HI>Guanavanae;</HI> it bringeth forth Sugar, Cotton-wooll, Hempe, and other things as with us, beside divers sorts of strange Trees and Herbes. It hath sweet Spices, Pearles and pretious stones; it aboundeth with incredible plenty of Gold and Silver, and with other Mettalls, and Mi∣neralls. But it had not when it was discovered, either Oxen, Horses, Mules, Asses, Sheep, Goates, or Dogges. Wherefore it is no wonder if the inhabitants were strucken with amazement at the first sight of a Horse. Mice were first brought thither by a Ship of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> which sayled very farre through the Straight of <HI>Magellane.</HI> Since which time either by the fruitfulnesse of the Country, or of the Creatures them∣selves; they are multiplyed and increased in so exceeding a manner, that they spoyle the fruits of their harvest by knawing the hearbes and trees. It doth bring to us divers living Creatures, partly knowne to us, and partly unknowne. Among other things there is found a prodigi∣ous Beast, which hath on her belly another belly placed in the likenesse of a purse: and as often as she changeth her denne, she hides and car∣ries her young ones in that bagge. This Creature hath the body and snowte of a Foxe, the feete and hands of a Monkey, and the eares of a Batte. There is also another kinde of Creature (which the inhabitants doe call <HI>Cascuij</HI>) like a blacke Hogge, hairy, hard skinned, having little eyes, broade eares, cloven hoofes, armed with a short trunke or snowte like an Elephant; and having so terrible a cry or braying, that he makes men deafe: but his flesh is sweet to eate. Here is found a great com∣pany of wilde Boares, and fierce Tigers; and Lyons also, but those ve∣ry fearefull, and such as will runne away at the fight of a man. Here are also Peacocks, Phesants, Partridges, and divers other kindes of Birdes, but farre differing from ours: But of these wee will speake more largely in our particular descriptions. All <HI>America</HI> is divided (as wee said before) into two great <HI>Peninsulaes,</HI> whereof the one, which lyeth on this side of the <HI>Aequinoctiall,</HI> is called the Northerne <HI>America;</HI> the other the Southerne, because the greatest part of it is stretched out beyond the <HI>Aequinoctiall:</HI> although some Countries of it are neare unto the <HI>Aequi∣noctill.</HI> The Northerne <HI>America</HI> is divided into many Regions, as namely, <HI>Quivira, Nova Hispania, Nicaragua, Iucatan, Florida, Apalchen, Norumbega, Nova Francia, Terra Laboratoris,</HI> and <HI>Estotilandia.</HI> There are many parts of the Southerne <HI>America,</HI> but these are the chiefest which have already been gotten and taken from the Savages: as <HI>Castella aurea, Plopaiana, Peruvia, Chile,</HI> and <HI>Brasilia:</HI> It doth glory especially in two Cities, <HI>Cusco</HI> and <HI>Mexico. Cusco</HI> is the Metropolis or chiefe Citie of Southerne <HI>America,</HI> which, both for bignesse, strength and magnifi∣cence,
<PB N="26" REF="64"/>
for the invincible fortification of the Castle, and the great com∣pany of nobility; for the order and placing of the houses, and for plea∣santnesse of situation, may worthily compare with the fairest Cities of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spaine.</HI> No common people are admitted into it, but it is the seate of Noble men and great Princes, who in that Country doe live in great numbers, partly within the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the Citie, and partly in Villa∣ges neare the Citie. Here are foure especiall Pallaces of Noble men, who doe governe the Common-wealth, which are stately and with great cost built with square carved Marble stone. And all the streets being straight, in many places make the forme of a Crosse, and through every one a pleasant River runneth in a channell walled on each side with stone. The forme of the Citie is foure square, lying sweetly on the side of a hill: on the steepe ascent of a Mountaine, a wonderfull faire Tower doth adorne the Citie, whose beauty or largenesse if you consider, those which have viewed many Countries, have seene few in all <HI>Europe</HI> like unto it. <HI>Mexico</HI> or <HI>Temistitan</HI> is a rich and famous Citie in <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> whereof wee will treate hereafter in the description of <HI>Nova Hispania:</HI> now we proceed to other things. This part of the World is watered with many famous Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lakes &amp; Rivers.</NOTE> the most whereof doe bring downe gold; and it is full of Lakes and Springs. In the Lakes and Rivers there are great plenty of fish: among which there is one kinde of them of chiefe note, which by the inhabitants of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> are called <HI>Manati.</HI> This Fish is somewhat like a Trout; he is five and twenty foot long, and twelve foote thicke, in his head and tayle hee resembles an Oxe; he hath small eyes, a hard and hairy skinne, of a light blew co∣lour, and two feete like an Elephant. The femalls of this kinde of fish doe bring forth their young ones, as Cowes doe, and doe let them sucke at their two dugges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣taines.</NOTE> Here are also very many Mountaines, a∣mong which, as <HI>Benso</HI> witnesseth, is a fire-vomiting Mountaine, which out of its hollow mouth doth send forth such great flakes of fire, that the blazing of it in the night doth cast forth a light which may bee seene above an hundred miles. Some have supposed that the gold mel∣ting within, doth afford continuall matter to the fire. For a certaine <HI>Dominican Frier,</HI> when he would make tryall thereof, caused a vessell of gold to bee made with an iron chaine: and afterward going to the Mountaine with foure other <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he let downe the vessell with the chaine into the hole of the hill; and there by the heate of the fire the vessell with part of the chaine was melted: and having tryed it againe with a bigger chaine, it hapned to melt againe in the same manner. Here the Cities generally are stately built, the wayes paved, and the houses very faire and beautifull. It is reported that here was a Kings garden, wherein herbes and trees, with their bodie, boughs, and fruits did stand of solid gold, and as bigge as those which grow in Orchards. And it is reported that here was a Kings Conclave, in which there were all kindes of living Creatures, made of precious stones, partly painted, and partly inlaid, and engraven. That which is reported concerning the two wayes in this Country is worthy of memory, the one whereof lyeth through the rough Mountaines, the other stretcheth through the plaine fields, from <HI>Quito</HI> a Citie of <HI>Peru,</HI> to the Citie <HI>Cusco,</HI> for the
<PB N="27" REF="64"/>
space of five hundred miles. The beauty of this worke is encreased, by many wonderfull heapes of stones, which were not brought thi∣ther by the strength of Horses, or Oxen, (both which the inhabitants wanted) but by the hands of men. The field way is defended on both sides with walls, and it is five and twenty foote broade, within which little streames doe runne, having their bankes planted with shrubby trees, which they call <HI>Molli.</HI> The other being hewed out of stones and rockes, passeth through the middle of the Mountaines, having the same bredth: Moreover the way in the uneven and lower part of the Val∣leyes, is fortified with fences, as the nature of the Country requires. These wayes King <HI>Gninacava</HI> (who lived not long since) caused to to be clensed, and the ruinous walls to be repaired and adorned, other∣wise the worke is more ancient, and there were placed all along by the way side Innes both faire, and pleasant, (they call them <HI>Tambi</HI>) in which all the Kings traine were received. And let this suffice concer∣ning the foure parts of the World in generall: now our method doth require that we should describe particularly the partes of <HI>Europe,</HI> which was set before in the first place.</P>

Therefore here is great store of milke-beasts in re∣gard of the great plentie thereof, so that they make store of Butter and Cheese, which they sell to those they traffique withall. There are onely two inhabited places knowne unto us in <HI>Groenland, Alba</HI> and the Mo∣nasterie of Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> of which wee will speake by and by.

they do not onely make hot all the roomes of the Monasterie like a hot-house, but also they bake their bread and dresse their meat, without the helpe of fire. The whole fabricke of the Monasterie doth consist of brit∣tle sandie stones, which the Mountaine doth cast forth in the midst of the flames. This fountaine doth warme the neighbour gardens so that they continually flourish with divers kindes of flowers and herbes. And the Sea neare unto it, by the vertue of these waters, is never frozen, but lyes continually open both for the fish and the use of man: which makes so great a concurse of fish to resort hither from colder places, that not onely these Monkes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freezland.</NOTE> but also the Inhabitants round about do live plentifully. <HI>Frislandia</HI> or <HI>Freezland</HI> was an Island altogether unknowne to the Auncients: being greater than<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heyling</HI> saies almost as bigge as <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ireland.</HI> The <HI>Climate</HI> is very in∣temperate.

do eate and feed upon the raw flesh of beasts and fishes. They are cloa∣thed with the skins of wild beasts taken in hunting, and they eate raw hearbes like beasts. Their Tents are covered with Whales skinnes; the cold being continually very sharpe in these parts. They use Dogges which are like unto our Wolves, and having yoked them together, they do make them draw things over the ice. Their weapons are Bowes and Arrowes, and slings. There is no wood there, but much Deere. The men do not plough the ground, as beeing content with that it bringeth forth of its own accord: they live by hunting: their drinke is the warme blood of wild beasts, or else ice water: there are no Rivers nor Springs, because the violence of the cold doth so shut up the Earth, that springs of water cannot breake forth. The men are very laborious, strong, hun∣ters, and cunning fowlers: they use a certaine kinde of boate made of leather, wherein one man can but sit, who maketh use but of one Oare, his right hand holding his bow wherewith hee shoots at the birds. The like hath beene seene in <HI>England. Davises Bay</HI> also was so called from <HI>Iohn Davis</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who in the yeare 1585. and the two follow∣ing yeares did search along the Coasts of <HI>America,</HI> or rather the Sou∣therne Coasts of <HI>Greenland</HI> from the 53. Degree to the 75. to finde out a passage that way unto <HI>China.</HI> Concerning the foure <HI>Euripideas</HI> in the table those things which you see are taken out of the Register booke of <HI>Iames Cnoxen Buscoducensis,</HI> who doth report that a certaine <HI>English Mi∣norite Frier</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> being a Mathematician, did describe the Coun∣tries lying neare unto the <HI>Pole,</HI> and measured them with his <HI>Astrolabe</HI> in this following shape, as <HI>Mercator</HI> hath gathered them out of <HI>Iames Cno∣xens</HI> Booke. Hee saith that these foure Seas are carried with such vio∣lence to the Innermost <HI>Gulfe,</HI> that ships being once entred can never be driven backe againe with any winde, and that there is never so great a winde, as that it can drive about a wind-mill. But these things are as true as <HI>Lucians</HI> fables, seeing they who have viewed these places in which those seas are said to be, do finde no such <HI>Euripi,</HI> or swift flowing Seas at all, namely the <HI>Hollanders</HI> who have discovered the Sea even to the 81. Degree of Latitude. But concerning the habitation of the Northerne people, let us heare <HI>Iulius Scaliger</HI> in his 37. Exercitation, where he thus speaking concerning a voiage from the Northerne Sea towards <HI>China. There are</HI> (saith hee) <HI>divers arguments brought by divers men on both sides, and it is diversly judged of, whether it be possible to saile by that Sea. But these are ours. They would have us to saile from the mouth of the River</HI> Duvina, <HI>all along that Countrie which encompasses all</HI> Scythia <HI>even to the East corner: in which winding course wee are to change the Northerne wind for the Westerne. But those which speake thus, it is certaine they do not know the nature of this Sea, nor of the Windes and Coast: For the West and East windes are so rare in this Sea that they are almost scarce knowne. But so many North windes are there here that it seemes Nature hath committed the government of these parts unto them alone. There are many foards blinde and muddie. In winter, which continueth ten moneths, the superficies or upper part of the Sea, is as hard as any pave∣ment. In Summer there are continuall mists, which in the afternoone as fast as one is expelled another rises. Besides, the Ice is very dangerous, the great pieces whereof floting up and downe, are like moving Islands running one amongst ano∣ther.</HI> It is certaine that by the late Navigations of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the
<PB N="32" REF="68"/>
yeare 1594. and in the two following yeares, it was hoped, that wee might saile out of the Northerne Sea to the Eastern parts of the World. But very difficultly, in regard of the Ice, and long winter nights. <HI>William Barentson</HI> did denie that it was possible to saile by the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Nassovia</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> not onely for the Ice, but also because hee found by divers ob∣servations, that it was not a Sea but a <HI>Bay,</HI> and especially because hee found there was no Tide nor Ebbe: and yet hee was in great hope that a way might be found out by the most Northerne part of <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> But seeing there are every day new voyages made to discover the pas∣sage that way to <HI>China,</HI> experience will teach them at last whether it can be done or not. It is manifest that our ships have sailed even to the 81. Degree of Northerne Latitude, and yet found the Sea open: but yet afterward at the 76. Degree they have beene hindred with great pieces of ice, and the night comming on, so that they could proceed no further. The Sunne left them the 4. of <HI>November</HI> in the yeare 1596, and was seene again the 24. of <HI>Ianuary</HI> in the following yeare, all which time these valiant <HI>Argonautes,</HI> for so I may call them, hid themselves in a little shed which they built up in <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> untill the 14. of <HI>Iune.</HI> For though the voyage of the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iason</HI> and his Companions, who sayled to <HI>Celchos</HI> to fetch the golden fleece, of whom reade <HI>Valerius Flaceus Lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Argonautes</HI> is made so famous by posteritie, yet if it be compared with this it will seeme but a toy; for who hath beene, for the space of 13. Moneths separated from the societie of men, before the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who wanting all necessaries, and enduring extre∣mitie of cold, did even under the 76. Degree of Latitude, build them∣selves houses to receive them, and defend them from the violence of the weather, in which they lay buried and covered over with deepe snow almost ten whole moneths? I conceale that which they suffered in returning, being compell'd to leave their ships and betake themselves to their boate. I omit to speake of the cruell, fierce, and great Beares, and Sea-Monsters, with which they oftentimes were enforced to fight. All which troubles, labours, and difficulties they most valiantly by the pro∣tection and favour of the Divine power did overcome.</P>

The Latitude or breadth is sixe and fiftie <HI>German</HI> miles. It hath an ungentle ayre, and for the most part it is unhabited, especially towards the North, by reason of the vehement Westerne windes, which will not suffer the shrubs (as <HI>Olaus</HI> writeth) to rise up. The Land is unfit for tillage, neither doth it beare any graine; but all that have written of this Isle doe report, that it hath such abundance of grasse, that unlesse the Cattell were somtime driven from the pasture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The quality of the Soyle and Ayre.</NOTE> they would be in danger to die, and be choak't with their owne fatnesse. <HI>Ionas</HI> himselfe confesseth, that they have no labouring beasts, but Horses and Oxen: and here all the Oxen and Kine have no hornes, nor their Sheepe likewise. They have little white Dogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The varietie of living Crea∣tures.</NOTE> which they very much esteeme. They have abundance of white Faulcones, and white Crowes, which prey upon the young Lambes and Hogges. Also there are white Beares and Hares. Also (as <HI>Islandus</HI> witnesseth) there are Eagles with white traines: which <HI>Pliny</HI> (as he saith) called <HI>Pygargos. Velleius</HI> repor∣teth, that this Island beareth no tree but the <HI>Birch</HI> and <HI>Iuniper</HI> trees: so that there is great scarcitie of wood through the whole Island, unlesse by chance (which somtimes happens) some great trees being rooted up by the violence of the winde, are brought out of the Northerne parts, and like wracks cast upon these moores, which the Inhabitants use in building houses and ships. It hath beene subject to the King of <HI>Norwey,</HI> (as <HI>Ionas</HI> reporteth) from the yeare 1260. in which they first did ho∣mage to him: In regard whereof, the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> and <HI>Norwey</HI> doth yearely send thither a Governour, who keepes his residence in the Castle called <HI>Bestede,</HI> whom they now obey, as heretofore they did their
<PB N="34" REF="69"/>
Bishops, by whom they were converted to the Christian Faith, under the reigne of <HI>Edelbert.</HI> In the time of <HI>Harald</HI> the <HI>Faire-haired,</HI> the first Monarch of <HI>Norwey,</HI> some thinke it began to be inhabited: for when hee had expell'd a great company of Noble men out of <HI>Norwey,</HI> they (forsaking their owne Countrie) came with their whole Families and dwelt here. It is likely, that these things happened a thousand yeares after Christ; but as <HI>Islandus Ionas</HI> writeth about the yeare 874, who de∣clareth the succession and names of these Bishops. <HI>Crantzius</HI> nameth <HI>Islephus</HI> to be the first Bishop. But it seemeth, as we may collect out of the <HI>Eclogues</HI> of <HI>Nicolas Zenius,</HI> that it was under the command of the <HI>Norwe∣gians</HI> two hundred yeares before, where we reade, that <HI>Zichmus</HI> King of <HI>Frisland</HI> did attempt to get this Island by force of Armes, but was re∣puls'd by the King of <HI>Norwey</HI>'s Garrison Souldiers, placed in this Island. The whole Island is divided into foure parts. The Easterne part they call <HI>Austlendingafiordung,</HI> the Westerne <HI>Westlendingafiordung,</HI> the Nor∣therne <HI>Nortendingafiordung,</HI> the Southerne <HI>Suydlendingafiordung.</HI> They have no Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Foun∣taines.</NOTE> but Mountaines in stead thereof. Here is a Fountaine, the exhalations whereof will change any thing into stone, and yet the shape thereof shall still remaine. And there is a Fountaine of pestilent water, which will poyson any one that tastes of it. There is water that tastes like beere. The Northerne <HI>Ocean,</HI> in which this Island is situate, doth afford such great plenty of fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sea.</NOTE> and is so commodious to the Com∣mon-wealth of <HI>Iseland,</HI> that all the Inhabitants doe live and maintaine their Families by it. I should want time to reckon up the severall kindes of Fish that are in the Sea, yet it will not be amisse, to remember some of the rarest. Among which there is a kind of Fish called <HI>Nahual,</HI> where∣of if any one eate, he dieth presently; and he hath a tooth in the inner∣most part of his head, which standeth forth 7 cubits in length, which some have sold for an <HI>Vnicornes</HI> horne, and it is beleev'd to have a great vertue against poyson. This Monster is fortie yards long. The <HI>Royder</HI> is an hundred and thirty Elles long, and hath no teeth; his flesh is most sweet and pleasant in eating, and his fat doth heale many diseases. There is the <HI>Brittish Whale,</HI> which is thirty Elles long, having no teeth, but a tongue seven Elles in length. And there is a kinde of a great <HI>Whale,</HI> which is seldome seene, being rather like an Island it selfe than a Fish. In regard of the hugenesse of his body, hee cannot follow the lesser fi∣shes, yet hee takes them by cunning and craftinesse. There is also an o∣ther Fish called <HI>Stantus Valur,</HI> all grisly, and something like a <HI>Thornback,</HI> but much greater; when he appeareth he seemes like an Island, and o∣verturneth Ships with his Fins. There are also Sea-Oxen, called <HI>Seenaut,</HI> of a grisly colour, and divers other fishes. I come now to the Moun∣taines.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣taines.</NOTE> In <HI>Iseland</HI> (saith <HI>Georgius Agricola</HI>) there are three very high Mountaines, whose tops are alwayes white with continuall Snow, the bottomes doe burne with continuall Fire.

Not farre from <HI>Hecla</HI> there are Mynes of Brimstone, which is the onely commodity of traffique, that belongs to the Inhabitants of <HI>Iseland.</HI> For Merchants doe fraight and loade their ships with it.

noise like thunder, casteth forth great stones, vomiteth out Brimstone, and fils all the ground with ashes round about it, so that the Countrie cannot be inhabited for two entire miles round about it. They which draw neere to this Mountaine to consider and view more curiously the causes why it burnes, are somtime swallowed up alive by some hidden breach in the Mountaine, for there are many, and those covered so with ashes, that no man can beware of them: therefore they call this place<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Papists</HI> thinke, that here is their feined <HI>Purga∣torie.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Carcer sordidarum animarum,</HI> the prison-house of uncleane soules. Be∣sides it happeneth, that the yee being loosed, doth in great peeces for 8 moneths together beat against the shore, and maketh such an horrible sound, that the Inhabitants say, it is the crying and howling of those soules. There is an other Mountaine of the same nature called <HI>Helga:</HI> this Mountaine in the yeare 1581, (as <HI>Ionas</HI> witnesseth) did cast forth fire and stones with such a thundering noise, that foure score miles from thence, they thought some great pieces of Ordnance had beene shot off. In one part hereof, strange Spirits are seene in the liknesse of men, so that those who doe not know them to bee dead before, would thinke they were alive: nor doe they finde their errour before the ghosts doe vanish away. But these things <HI>Ionas</HI> thinkes are fabulous, or else the delusions of the Devill. <HI>Crantzius</HI> and <HI>Olaus</HI> doe write, that the Islanders, for the most part, doe dwell in Caves, which they digge in the sides of the Mountaines, especially in the Winter time. But <HI>Ionas,</HI> on the contrary, saith, that there are many Temples and houses built of wood very faire and costly. The Island hath two Cathedrall Bishopricks, as <HI>Holar,</HI> or <HI>Hallen,</HI> under which are the Monasteries <HI>Pingora, Remested, Modur, Mun∣keniere;</HI> and <HI>Scalholt,</HI> under which are those Monasteries <HI>Videy, Pyrne∣bar, Kirckebar,</HI> and <HI>Shieda.</HI> Yet wee understand by the writings of <HI>Vel∣leius</HI> the Authour of this Table, that there are nine Monasteries in it, and three hundred and nine and twenty Churches. The Bishops are sent thi∣ther out of the Universitie of <HI>Haffnia,</HI> the only University in <HI>Denmarke;</HI> one of them governeth the Northerne part of the Island, the other the Southerne.

Yet the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Merchants doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouble their quiet, not suffering them to be con∣tent with their owne; for they frequenting this Island, to bring away fish from thence, have brought among them their vices together with their wares.

Afterward, the Iland was divided into two Kingdomes, namely <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land:</HI> but at last, under the happy raigne of <HI>Iames</HI> the sixt King of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> these two Kingdomes were<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">They were first united in the yeare of grace 1603.

great a matter it was held to sayle upon this Sea, that <HI>Iulius Firmicus</HI> in his Booke concerning the errours of prophane Religions, cryeth out thus to <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour. <HI>In Winter (which was never heretofore done, nor shall bee done) you have passed over the swelling raging waters of the</HI> Brittish <HI>Ocean, the waves of a Sea almost unknowne to us have trembled under our Oares: and the</HI> Brittaines <HI>have beene afraid at the unlookt-for presence of the Emperour.

Some would have it called <HI>Hibernia</HI> from <HI>Hiberus,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Captaine, who first possessed it, and peo∣pled it: some say from the River <HI>Iberus,</HI> because the Inhabitants thereof did first inhabite this Island: some <HI>ab hiberno tempore,</HI> from the winter season, because it enclines towards the West: the Author of the <HI>Eu∣logue,</HI> from <HI>Irnalphus,</HI> a Captaine. It was called without doubt <HI>Hibernia</HI> and <HI>Iuverna,</HI> from <HI>Ierna,</HI> which <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI> mention; but that <HI>Ierna,</HI> together with <HI>Iris, Yverdhon,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> did proceede from the word <HI>Erin,</HI> used by the Inhabitants; therefore the Etymologie is to bee drawne from the word <HI>Erin.</HI> Here<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 642.</NOTE> <HI>Camden</HI> affirmes, that hee knowes not what to conjecture, unlesse, saith hee, it bee derived from <HI>Hiere</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> word, which with them signifies the West, whence <HI>Erin</HI> seemes to bee drawne, being as much to say as the Westerne Countrie. This Island is stretched forth from the South Northward in an ovall forme, not twenty dayes sayle, as <HI>Philemon</HI> in <HI>Ptolemie</HI> delivers, but onely 400.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situation.</NOTE> miles; and is scarce 200. miles broad. On the East it hath <HI>Brittaine,</HI> from which it is parted by the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, which is one dayes sayle: On the North, where the <HI>Deucaledon</HI> Ocean, which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> cals the Northern, breakes in, it hath <HI>Iseland:</HI> On the South it looketh towards <HI>Spaine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The temper of the Ayre.</NOTE> The Ayre of this Island is very wholsome, the Climate very gentle, warme and temperate; for the Inhabitants neither by the heate of Summer are enforced to seeke s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>adie places, nor yet by cold to sit by the fire: yet the seedes in regard of the moistnesse of <HI>Autumne</HI> doe seldome come to maturitie and ripenesse.

What the Spring produceth, the Summer cherisheth, but it can hardly bee gathered, in regard they have too much raine in Harvest time; for this Island hath windes and raine very often. But (as <HI>Mela</HI> saith) it is so full of pleasant sweete grasse, that when the Cattell have fed some part of the day, if they bee not restrained and kept from grazing, they will endanger the bursting of themselves. Which also <HI>So∣linus</HI> witnesseth concerning this Island. Hence it proceedes, that there

are infinite numbers of Cattell, which are the Inhabitants chiefe riches, and many flocks of Sheepe, which they sheare twice a yeare. They have excellent Horses (called <HI>Hobbies</HI>) which are not pac'd like others, but doe amble very gently. No creeping thing nor Serpent liveth here, nor also in <HI>Crete:</HI> and Serpents being often brought hither out of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> as soone as they came neere the Land, and smell'd the Ayre, they died. <HI>Beda</HI> witnesseth, that he hath seene some, who have beene stung with Serpents, that have drunk the leaves of Bookes (brought out of <HI>Ireland</HI>) in a Potion, and straight-way the force of the poyson was allayde, and the swelling of the body went downe againe. <HI>Ireland</HI> hath greater store of Faulcons and Hawkes, than other Countries. And here Eagles are as common as Kites in some places. Besides, here is so great a number of Cranes, that you shall often see a hundred in a company together. In the North part also there are abundance of Swannes, but there are few Storkes through the whole Island, and those black. There are few Par∣triges and Pheasants, but no Pies, nor Nightingales. Here is such great store of Bees, that they doe not onely breede in hives, but also in hollow trees, and in the cavernes of the earth. <HI>Giraldus</HI> also writeth a strange thing concerning a kinde of Birde, commonly called a <HI>Barnacle,</HI> that out of certain pieces of wood, floating up and down in the Sea, there comes out first a kinde of Gumme, which afterward growes into a hard sub∣stance, within which little Creatures are generated, which first have life, and afterward have bils, feathers and wings, with which they doe flye in the Ayre, or swim in the water, and in this manner and no other this Creature is generated. This <HI>Giraldus</HI> doth testifie, that hee hath seene some of them halfe formed, which as soone as they came to perfection did flie as well as the rest. There are also many birds of a twofold shape, (as he witnesseth) which they call <HI>Aurifrisij,</HI> lesser than an Eagle, and bigger than a Hawke; whom Nature, to delight her selfe, hath framed with one foote armed with tallents sharpe and open, the other smoothe with a plaine webbe. There are other Birdes which they call <HI>Marineta,</HI> lesse than a Blackbird, being short like a Starling, yet differing from him by the whitenesse of the belly, and the blacknesse of the back. It is a wonderfull thing which was reported concerning these Birdes, for if when they are dead they be kept in a dry place, they will not putrifie or corrupt: and being placed among garments and other things, it will preserve them from moathes. That which is more worthy of admira∣tion is that, if being dead, they be hanged up in some drie place, they will every yeare renew and change their feathers, as if they were alive <HI>Ireland</HI> contayneth all kindes of wilde beasts. It hath Harts that are so fat, that they can hardly runne; and by how much they are lesser in body, by so much the larger are their hornes. There are great store of Bores, many Hares, &amp;c. but the bodies of all the wilde beasts and birds are lesser here than in other places. It hath many Badgers, and Weesils. It hath few or no Goates, fallow Deere, Hedghogs, Moles; but infinite store of Mice. It hath also Wolves and Foxes. But enough of these things, I returne to other matters.

This Countrie is unequall and mountainous, soft and waterish: you shall finde Lakes and standing waters on the top of the Mountaines.

Their warre is partly on hors∣back, and partly on foote. The Gentrie have horses well managed, so that without any advantage they will mount them in their armour, and taking a Javelin or dart of great weight by the middle, they will throw or brandish it against their enemie with much ease.

The equall tem∣per of the <HI>Clime</HI> is the cause that the soyle doth plentifully bring forth divers kindes of trees, some bearing fruit, and others for building.

A countrie full of inaccessible and wooddy mountains betweene which there are many hollow vallies, having thicke woods in them. The Earles of <HI>Desmond</HI> were heretofore honoured with the dig∣nitie of Counts <HI>Palatine</HI> hereof, but by the wickednesse of men, which would have libertie and yet knew not how to use it, it was long since converted into a sinke of impietie, and a refuge for seditious persons.

But when that famous and warlike Depu∣tie the Lord <HI>Arthur Gray</HI> came with his forces, hee did soone decide the matter. For forthwith they yeelded themselves, and most part of them were put to death, because it seemed most safe and fit so to doe, the affaires of the Kingdome requiring it, and the rebells being on every hand. The Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> himselfe fled to the woods, and having hid himselfe in a Cottage was wounded by a Souldier or two who rushed in upon him, and afterward being knowne, he was beheaded for his tre∣cherie and wasting of his Countrie.

though this Citie bee distant from the Sea sixtie miles, yet the ship-masters doe bring shippes of great burthen even to the walls of the Citie, neither neede they feare any rockes all the way they come up. It is wonderfull to see what store and plentie of fish you shall finde there. <HI>Iohn</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> being enamoured with the pleasantnesse of this Cittie, built there a faire Castle, and a Bridge. There is also <HI>Corcagia</HI> in the Countie of <HI>Corke,</HI> which the <HI>English</HI> call <HI>Cork,</HI> and the natives <HI>Korkcach,</HI> environed with a wall, not very wide in compasse. It is stretched out so as to make but one street, yet there is a prettie and very faire market place; it hath an excellent safe harbour, but hath heretofore beene so encompassed with seditious neighbours, that they keepe continuall watch and ward, as if they were alwaies besieged, and they scarce marrie their daughters into the countrie, by reason whereof, marrying among themselves, all the Citizens are somewhat allied one to another. The Citizens are strong in Souldiers, they addict themselves to merchandise, and governe their affaires both at home and abroad very frugally. <HI>Coenalis</HI> writeth, that the holy man <HI>Briacus</HI> came from hence, from whom the Diocesse of <HI>Sanbrioch</HI> in <HI>Brittaine,</HI> common∣ly called S. <HI>Brieu,</HI> tooke its name.

The Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Nobles of the King∣dome have their Pallaces in the Citie, when they are summoned to Par∣liament. The Citie it selfe is not built of bricke, but of free squared stone, so that the severall houses may bee compared to great Pallaces. But enough of this, let us passe to other things.

<PB N="71" REF="97"/>
the Kings and the Kings Sonnes lawfully begotten have the first place, of which if there bee many, the eldest Sonne is called Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the rest are onely called Princes, but when the King is publick∣ly crowned, hee promiseth to all the people, that he will keepe and ob∣serve the Lawes, Rites, and Customes of his Ancestours, and use them in the same manner as they did. The Dukes have the second place, the Earles the third, and those Nobles the fourth place, who are not known by that Title in forraine Countries, but the <HI>Scots</HI> doe call them <HI>My Lords.</HI> This name is so much esteem'd amongst them, that for honours sake they attribute it to their Bishops, Earles, and chiefest Magistrates. In the fifth place are the Knights and Barons, who are usually called Lords. They are in the sixth and last place, who having attained to no title of honour, but yet descended from a noble Familie, are therefore commonly called Gentlemen; as the Brothers, and Sonnes of Earles and Lords, the youngest Sonnes of Knights, who have no part in the Inheritance, because (by the Lawes of <HI>Scotland</HI>) that commeth unto the eldest Sonne, for the preservation of the Familie, but the common peo∣ple call all those Gentlemen, who are either rich or well spoken of for their hospitality. The whole weight of warre doth depend on the No∣bility of the lowest degree. The Plebeians or Citizens are partly chiefe men, who beare office in their Cities, partly Merchants, and partly Tradesmen, or Handy-craftes-men, all which because they are free from Tribute and other burdens, doe easily grow rich. And least any thing should be too heavily enacted against any Citie, the King permits that in publick assemblies or Parliaments three or foure Citizens, being called out of every Citie, should freely interpose their opinion concer∣ning matters propounded. Heretofore the Clergie was governed by the authoritie of Decrees &amp; Councels, but now (as the rest) they are ru∣led by the Lawes, which the Kings have devised, or confirmed by their royall assent. The Booke which containeth the <HI>municipall</HI> Lawes, writ∣ten in Latine, is entituled <HI>Regia Majestas,</HI> the Kings Majestie, because the Booke begins with those words: In the other Bookes of the Lawes, the Acts of their Councels (which are called Parliaments) are written in <HI>Scotch.</HI> There are many and divers Magistrates in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in other Nations. Among these, the chiefe and next to the King is the Prote∣ctour of the Kingdome (whom they call the Governour.) Hee hath the charge of governing the Kingdome, if the Common-wealth at any time be deprived of her King; or the King by reason of his tender age cannot manage the affaires of the Kingdome. There is also a continuall Senate at <HI>Edenburrough,</HI> so framed of the Clergie and Nobilitie, that the Clergie doth in number equall the Laiety. The Clergie have a Presi∣dent over them, who hath the first place in delivering his opinion, un∣lesse the Chancellour of the Kingdome bee present, for hee hath the chiefe place in all affaires of the Kingdome. Hee that sits on matters of life and death, they call The great Justice; hee that lookes to Sea-mat∣ters, the Admirall: he that lookes to the Campe, the Marshall: and he that punishes offences, committed in the Court, is called the Constable. There are also in severall Provinces, which they call Viecounties, those which are Governours of them, whom by an ancient name they
<PB N="72" REF="98"/>
call Vicounts. Their authority in deciding those matters which belong to civill causes, doth depend on a certaine hereditary right, by which they claime also unto themselves those Vicountships. So that these Vi∣counts may be said not to be created by the King, but borne unto it by right from their Parents. The Cities also and Townes have their Go∣vernours, their Bailiffes, and other Magistrates of that kinde, who keepe the Citizens in obedience, and doe maintaine and defend the Priviled∣ges of the Cities, whereby it comes to passe that the Common-wealth of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the apt disposition and ranking of Degrees, by the holy Majestie of Lawes and the authority of Magistrates, doth flourish, and deserveth great praise. These are the names of the Dukedomes, Earle∣domes, and Vicountships of <HI>Scotland:</HI> the Dukedome of <HI>Rotsay</HI> and <HI>Al∣bania,</HI> and the Dukedome of <HI>Lennox,</HI> the Countie of <HI>Carnes, Sutherlant, Rosse, Murray, Buchquhan, Garniach, Garmoran, Mar, Mernis, Angus, Gowry, Friffe, Marche, Athole, Stratherne, Menteith, Wagion, Douglasse, Carrike, Crawford, Annandale, Ourmonth,</HI> and <HI>Huntley.</HI> The Vicountships are, <HI>Berwick, aliàs North-Berwyk, Roxburgh, Selkirk, Twedale, Dunfrise, Niddisdale, Wigton, Are, Lanarke, Dunbretton, Sterueling, Louthean, Lau∣den, Clacmanan, Kiuros, Fiffe, Perth, Angus, Mernis, Aberdone, Bamph, Fo∣res,</HI> and <HI>Inuernes.</HI> There are the Universities of Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Aber∣done,</HI> the later was adorned with many priviledges by King <HI>Alexander,</HI> and his Sister <HI>Isabel,</HI> about the yeare 1240.

For the generall, this Country hath greater plenty of va∣liant men, then of fruit or cattle, for it is altogether of a light sandie soyle: which doth sharpen the industrie of the Inhabitants, and their sparing life doth confirme the strength of their mindes and bodies. In this Country about ten miles from the Towne <HI>Ayr,</HI> there is a stone al∣most twelve foot high, and thirty Cubits thicke, which is called the deafe stone, for if you hollow or shoot off a Musket on the one side, hee that standeth on the other side next to the stone cannot heare it, he that stands farther off shall heare it better, and he that stands farthest off shall heare it best. After this <HI>Cunningam</HI> runneth to the North, and straight∣neth <HI>Glotta,</HI> untill it become a small River. It is manifest that the name of this Country came from the <HI>Danes,</HI> and in their language signifies a Kings house, which is a signe that the <HI>Danes</HI> sometimes possessed it. Next on the East side is situated <HI>Renfroan,</HI> so called from a Towne, in which the Inhabitants kept their publike meetings, it is commonly cal∣led <HI>Baronia.</HI> Two Rivers doe cut through the middle of it, which are both called <HI>Carth.</HI> After this Country is <HI>Clidesdale</HI> aforenamed, stretch∣ed forth to either banke of <HI>Glotta,</HI> and poureth forth many Noble Ri∣vers: on the left hand <HI>Aven,</HI> and <HI>Duglasse,</HI> which doe runne into <HI>Glotta:</HI> on the right hand another <HI>Aven,</HI> which seperates <HI>Sterling</HI> on the South from <HI>Lothiana,</HI> and on the East from the <HI>Fyrth,</HI> untill at last growing lesser, it hath a Bridge over it neare <HI>Sterling.</HI> There is one Ri∣ver that cutteth through this Country, which is worthy of memory, called <HI>Carron,</HI> neare to which are some ancient Monuments. On the left side of <HI>Carron</HI> there are two little hills built by the industrie of men, which are commonly called <HI>Duni pacis.</HI> On the right side of <HI>Car∣ron,</HI> there is a plaine field that at last riseth into a little hill, being in the middle betweene <HI>Duni pacis,</HI> and a little Chappell. On the side of this hill there appeareth yet the ruines or remainder of a small Citie. But the foundation of the Walls, and the description of the streetes, partly by tillage, and partly by digging forth squared stones for the building of rich mens houses, cannot be distinctly knowne. This place <HI>Beda</HI> doth call <HI>Guidi,</HI> and doth place it in a corner of the trench made by <HI>Severus</HI> the Emperour. Many famous <HI>Roman</HI> Writers have made mention of this Trench and Bulwarke. Here many tokens doe remaine, and many stones are digged up with inscriptions, which are either testimonies of ayde formerly received by the <HI>Tribunes</HI> and <HI>Centurions,</HI> or of their Se∣pulchers in those places. Beyond <HI>Sterling</HI> is <HI>Levinis</HI> or <HI>Lennox,</HI> divided from <HI>Renfroan</HI> by <HI>Glotta,</HI> from <HI>Glasco</HI> by the River <HI>Keluin:</HI> it is parted from <HI>Sterling</HI> or <HI>Striveling</HI> with the Mountaines, from <HI>Taichia,</HI> by the <HI>Forth:</HI> at length it endeth at the Mountaine <HI>Grampius,</HI> at the foot there∣of the Lake <HI>Lomund</HI> through a hollow Vale extendeth it selfe 24. miles in length, and 8. in breadth, which containeth above 24. Islands. Be∣sides a multitude of other fishes, it hath some particular unto it selfe, which are pleasant in taste, called <HI>Pollacks.</HI> There are three things re∣ported of this Lake very memorable: First the Fish have no Finnes, but otherwise are of an excellent taste. Secondly, the water when there is no winde is sometime so rough, that it would affright the boldest Mar∣riner,

from weighing Anker. Lastly, there is a certaine Island fit to feed flocks of cattle, which moveth up and downe, and is driven to and fro with every tempest. But I returne to the Lake, which at last breaking forth toward the South, doth send forth the River <HI>Levin,</HI> which giveth its owne name to the Country. This River neare to the Castle <HI>Brittano∣dun,</HI> or <HI>Dun brittan,</HI> and a Towne of the same name, entreth into <HI>Glotta.</HI> The farthest Hills of the Mountaine <HI>Grampius</HI> doe somewhat raise the farthest part of <HI>Levinia,</HI> being cut through with a little <HI>Bay</HI> of the Sea, which for the shortnesse of it they call <HI>Gerloch.</HI> Beyond this is a farre larger <HI>Bay,</HI> which they call <HI>Longus,</HI> from the River <HI>Long</HI> that falleth into it. This is the bound betweene <HI>Levinia</HI> and <HI>Covalia. Covalia</HI> it selfe,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Called also <HI>Argile,</HI> and <HI>Ar∣gadia.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Argathel</HI> or rather <HI>Ergathel</HI> and <HI>Cnapdale,</HI> are divided into many parts by many straight <HI>Bayes</HI> made by the estuarie of <HI>Glotta,</HI> or <HI>Dun-Brittan Fryth.</HI> There is one famous Lake amongst the rest; they call it <HI>Finis</HI> from the River <HI>Fin,</HI> which it receiveth, it is 60 miles long. There is in <HI>Knapdale</HI> the Lake <HI>Avus,</HI> in which there is a small Island with a fortified Castle. From hence the River <HI>Avus</HI> runneth forth, which alone in these Countries emptieth it selfe into the <HI>Deucalidon</HI> Sea. Beyond <HI>Knapdale</HI> towards the West <HI>Cantiera</HI> or <HI>Cantyre</HI> runneth out, that is, the head of the Country, over against <HI>Ireland,</HI> from which it is parted by a small narrow Sea, being longer than broad, and joyned so straightly, and in such a narrow manner to <HI>Cnapdale,</HI> that it is scarce a mile over, and even that is nothing else but sand. On <HI>Cantyre Lauria</HI> toucheth, lying neare to <HI>Argathel,</HI> and reaching neare to <HI>Abry:</HI> it is a plaine Country, and not unfruitfull. In that place where the Mountaine <HI>Grampius</HI> is some∣what lower, and more passable, the Country is called <HI>Braid Albin,</HI> that is to say, the highest part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where it is highest it is called <HI>Drum Albin,</HI> that is the backe of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and not without reason. For out of the backe Rivers doe runne into either Sea, some into the North, some into the South: out of the Lake <HI>Iernus,</HI> it sendeth forth the River <HI>Ierna</HI> into the East, which having runne three miles falls into <HI>Taus</HI> be∣neath <HI>Perth.</HI> From this River <HI>Strathierna</HI> or <HI>Stathierna,</HI> extended to either banke thereof, tooke its name.

This Parliament the King cals and appoints accor∣ding to his pleasure: Hee hath the chiefe authority in making, confir∣ming, abrogating, and interpreting of Lawes, and in all things that be∣long to the good of the Common-wealth. The temporall Courts are two-fold, namely of Law, and of equity. The Courts of Law are the Kings Bench, the Starre-Chamber, the Common Pleas, the Exche∣quer, the Court of Wards and Liveries, the Court of the Admiraltie and Assises; wee omit others which are obscure. The Kings Bench is so called, because the King is wont to sit in it, and it handleth Pleas of the Crowne. The Starre-Chamber, or rather the Court of the Kings Counsell is that, in which criminall matters are handled, as perjuries, impostures, deceits, and the like. The Common Pleas is so called, be∣cause common pleas are tried there betweene the Subjects, by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> which they call the Common Law. The Exchequer de∣riveth its name from a foure square Table, covered with a Chequer-Cloth, at which the Barons sit; in it all causes are heard, which belong to the Exchequer. The Court of Wards hath his name from Wards, whose causes it handleth. The Admirals Court handleth Sea-matters Those which wee call the Assises, are held twice in a yeare in most Shires; in which two Judges of Assise appointed for it, with the Justices of peace doe enquire and determine of civill and criminall matters. The Courts of Equity are the <HI>Chancerie,</HI> the Court of Requests, and the Councell in the Marshes of Wales. The Chancerie draweth its name from the Chancellour, who sitteth there. This Court gives judgement according to equitie, and the extreame rigour of the Law is thereby
<PB N="87" REF="108"/>
tempered. The Court of Requests heareth the causes of the poore, and of the Kings Servants. The chiefe spirituall Courts are the Corporati∣tion of the Clergie, the Courts which belong to the Archbishop him∣selfe, and the Chancellours Courts, kept in every Diocesse. There are two famous Universities in this Kingdome <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge. Eng∣land</HI> doth produce happy and good wits, and hath many learned men, skilfull in all Faculties and Sciences. The people are of a large stature, faire complexion'd, and for the most part, gray-eyed, and as their Lan∣guage soundeth like the <HI>Italians,</HI> so they differ not from them in the ha∣bite and disposition of their body.

Through the middle of this Island there runneth a long ridge of hils, on which flockes of sheepe securely graze, whose fleeces are held to be the best wooll, except that of <HI>Lemster</HI> and <HI>Cotteswold,</HI> and therefore being chiefly bought up by Clothiers, the Inhabitants do make a great gaine and commoditie thereby. The Northerne part hath greene me∣dowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sea</NOTE> fields, and woods: the Southerne part is all corne-fields, en∣closed every where with ditches and hedges. At either end the Sea on the North side doth so penetrate and winde into it, that it maketh al∣most two Islands, and the Inhabitants do call them Islands, namely that which looketh toward the West the <HI>Fresh-water</HI> Isle, that which lyeth toward the East <HI>Binbrydge</HI> Isle. <HI>Vespasian</HI> serving under the Empe∣rour <HI>Claudius</HI> did first reduce this Island to the obedience of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">In Vespasiano cap. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Suetonius</HI> writeth in the life of <HI>Vespasian.</HI> The first <HI>Saxon</HI> that made it his owne was <HI>Cerdicius</HI> which gave it to <HI>Stuffa,</HI> and <HI>Whitgarus,</HI> who carri∣ed away the <HI>Brittish</HI> Inhabitants to <HI>Caresbrok,</HI> and put them to death; af∣terward <HI>Wolpherus</HI> being of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> brought <HI>Vecta</HI> or <HI>Wight</HI> under his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient government.</NOTE> and gave it to <HI>Edelwalch</HI> King of the South <HI>Saxons.</HI> After that <HI>Caedwalla</HI> King of the West-<HI>Saxons,</HI> (the aforesaid <HI>Edwalch</HI> being slaine, and <HI>Arnaldus</HI> Governour of the Island being made away) adjoyned it to his territories.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> But see more concerning these things in <HI>Camden.</HI> The In∣habitants by nature are warlike, bold, and forward, and the Souldiers very stout.

Over against which scarce two miles off standeth the Fort <HI>Hurst</HI> on a little tongue of ground in <HI>Hampshire.</HI> Here is also the Towne <HI>Quarre</HI> where a litle Monasterie was built in the yeare 1132 for vailed Virgins or close Nunnes, and <HI>Gods Hill</HI> where <HI>I.

The earth is sufficiently fertile, abounding with divers fruits and with flockes of cattell; it hath many sheepe, and most of them such as have foure hornes, is beautified with so many greene Or∣chards and Gardens, and those so fruitfull that the Inhabitants make a kinde of drinke of apples, which they call <HI>Sisera</HI> and the <HI>English Sider,</HI> therewith; but in regard they have little fuell, instead of wood they use Sea weeds (by them called <HI>Vraic</HI>) which seemes to be that sea grasse which <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions, and they grow so plentifully on these rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fertilitie of the Soyle.</NOTE> that they seeme a farre of to be thicke woods.

<HI>Gersey,</HI> for it hath onely tenne Parishes. Yet in this it is to be pre∣ferred before it, because it hath no venemous thing in it: beside it is more fortified by nature, as being encompassed on every side with bro∣ken cliffes among which the <HI>Smyris</HI> an hard and rough stone is found, which the <HI>English</HI> call an <HI>Emrall,</HI> with which Jewellers do cut their stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The qualitie of the Soyle.</NOTE> and Glaziers do cut their glasse.

The entrance into the Haven is fortified on either side with Castles, on the left hand is an anciēt Castle, &amp; on the right hand another which they call <HI>Cornet,</HI> sea∣ted on a high rock, &amp; environed with the Sea.

These Islands with other adjacent and lying neare unto them did heretofore belong to <HI>Normandie,</HI> but when <HI>Henry</HI> the first had overthrowne his bro∣ther <HI>Robert</HI> in the yeare of Christ 1108,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient Government.</NOTE> he adjoyned <HI>Normandie</HI> &amp; these Islands to the Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> since which time they have conti∣nued in faithfull obedience to <HI>England,</HI> although the <HI>French</HI> (banishing King <HI>Iohn</HI>) possessed <HI>Normandie</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third sold his right in <HI>Nor∣mandie,</HI> and yeelded up the possession of <HI>Aquitaine</HI> in consideration of a certaine summe of money.

<HEAD>THE STATE POLITICK OF THE KINGDOME OF DENMARKE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>ENMARKE is a large and populous Kingdome, commonly called <HI>Danemarch,</HI> as it were the Countrie of the <HI>Danes.</HI> But whence the originall of the <HI>Danes</HI> came, they them∣selves doe not know: Some doe fetch it from <HI>Danus,</HI> their first King, and some from the <HI>Dahi,</HI> a people of <HI>Asia, Dudo de S. Quintino,</HI> an ancient Writer (as <HI>Camden</HI> reporteth) doth af∣firme, that they came out of <HI>Scandia</HI> into the ancient seats of the <HI>Cimbri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ans.</HI> But they seeme to be so called from the waters, because AHA with them signifies a River, and they doe call themselves <HI>Daneman</HI> (that is) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it were, River-men, or Water-men. All <HI>Denmarke</HI> is a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> as the Description sheweth, and is divided into 184 Prefectships or Pro∣vinces, which they call <HI>Harret,</HI> and they are governed by so many Pre∣fects skilfull in the <HI>Danish</HI> Lawes. It hath a King rather by election of the Nobles, than by succession of birth: the ancient manner of chusing him was, that when they gave their voyce, they stood in the open field upon stones, devoting by the firme stabilitie of the stones under them, the constancy of their election. The Kings are crowned at <HI>Hafnia</HI> in the Church of the blessed Virgine <HI>Mary</HI> before the Altar, and are led into the aforesaid Church by the Senatours of the Kingdome, the ensignes of regality being carried before them, as the Sword, Globe, and Crown. Neither are these things attributed to speciall Families, as it is in most Countries, but as every one excelleth in vertue and dignitie, so is hee chosen to that place. First the King is compelled to sweare that he will observe certaine written Articles, and that hee will strictly defend the Christian Religion, and the Lawes and Customes of the Kingdome. Afterward hee is anoynted by the Bishop of <HI>Roeschild,</HI> and first the Crowne is set upon his head by all the Senatours, who then take their oath to his Majestie, if they have not done it before the Coronation, and then the King maketh out of the Gentry some Knights by the light stroke of a sword, for some service done either in peace or warre. Thus the ancient <HI>Danes</HI> did establish an excellent Politicall State and Monar∣chie, neither hath any Nation ever brought them into subjection, or tooke away their Country Rites and Priviledges. But on the contrary the Northerne people, as the <HI>Danes, Swedens, Norwegians,</HI> have wasted almost <HI>Europe,</HI> and in some places have established Kingdomes. For the expedition of the <HI>Cimbrians</HI> against <HI>Italie</HI> is knowne unto all Historio∣graphers,

<P>By which it appeares, as also by the followig warres, which divers Kings of the Familie of the <HI>Oldenburgs</HI> happily waged, that it is a war∣like Nation, and fortunate in vanquishing their enemies both by Land and Sea. The Noble men and Senatours of the Kingdome have a free power to elect the Kings, but for the most part they chuse the Kings el∣dest sonne, unlesse there be some sufficient cause for the contrary. How∣ever, they alwayes chuse one of the Royall bloud, and they doe not suffer the Kingdome to be divided, unlesse they be compelled thereunto by civill warres. They send the younger sonnes or brothers into other Countries, seeing they cannot participate in the government of the Kingdome: and hence it is that so many expeditions are undertaken by them. Moreover, seeing all the Nobles and Common-people can∣not live conveniently in their owne Countrie, therefore they seeke out to get themselves a more fit seate. For the Northerne people have a∣bundance of children, in regard of their abundance of bloud and heate; they are quarrellers and fighters, they drinke and eate much, (for the cold Ayre excites their appetite) and yet digest it well, whence it is that they live long; they are faire complexioned, of great stature, crafty and faithfull. And an argument, that they are long liv'd, is that their Kings have raigned very long, many of them thirty yeares, some forty, and some longer.</P>

<HEAD>The Politicall government.</HEAD>
<P>THere are five States or Orders in the Common-wealth of <HI>Den∣marke:</HI> The first is of the Kings Familie, the second of the Nobles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situation.</NOTE> among which there are neither Earles nor Barons, yet all of them can shew how their Nobilitie descended to them by a long pedigree of An∣cestours. They carry Bucklers, which they will not change nor alter,
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
because they anciently used them. There are some Families yet living, whose Ancestors were present at the Parley between <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, &amp; <HI>Hemmingus</HI> King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> upon the River <HI>Egidora</HI> or <HI>Eider,</HI> as the Familie of <HI>Vren</HI> and others. These hold their goods and lands in <HI>Capite,</HI> and they have free liberty to hawke and hunt in their owne lands, as the Counts have in <HI>Germany.</HI> Their goods are not feudatory, but hereditary. All the Castles, lands, and goods, as well moveable as immoveable, left them by their parents, are equally divided among the brethren: and the sisters by a speciall priviledge have a share also, yet so, that the brother hath two parts with the Castles and places of strength, and the sister but one. By this meanes the eldest sonnes have not much lands, yet some of them comming of a good Familie, and being endued with ver∣tue, through the Kings favour, doe advance themselves to great possessi∣ons by marriage. Out of this order the Senatours of the Kingdome are chosen, who are seldome more then 28. These Senatours have a certain allowance from the King and Kingdome, for they have Castles so long as they bee Senatours, for which they pay no rent to the King, but are charged to keepe certaine horses both in peace and warre, and whenso∣ever the King calls them, they are to be ready at the proper charge of the Kingdome. If they be sent on any Embassage out of the Kingdome, they have allowance out of the Exchequer, that they may performe their journey in a Princely manner, as becommeth a Kings Embassadours. The other Nobles also have sufficient maintenance from the King, whe∣ther they live at Court or not. For the King hath lands which in the <HI>Da∣nish</HI> speech are called <HI>Verleghninge</HI> or Benefices, and out of these hee gi∣veth maintenance, either for terme of life, or for yeares, to those who have done him or the Kingdome any service. And those who hold these Benefices of the King, are charged to keepe certaine horses, and to pay yearely a certaine summe of money into the Exchequer, yet so as they may gaine something in reward of their labour and service. There is also a good Law &amp; Institution in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> whereby the King is prohibited and restrained from buying any immoveable goods of the Nobles, least any dissention should arise betweene the King and them. For otherwise the King might by violence take into his hands those lands which the Nobles would not sell: yet the King may change any immoveable goods with the Nobles, though on the contra∣ry the Nobles cannot buy any of them of the Kings Farmers, many of which have hereditarie, and (as it were) free lands.</P>

Next to him is the Marshall, which in the time of warre and peace doth provide those things which appertaine to expedition. In the third place is the Admirall, which doth build new ships, repaire the old, and every year order the sea-matters, for the securing of the coasts. He hath under him an other Admirall appointed, and in every ship a Captaine, who must bee borne a Gentleman. There is also the Chancellour of the Kingdome, to whom out of all the Provinces and Isles they appeale and make suite unto, and from whom appeale is also made to the King and the Senate of the Kingdome. All the Provinces are divided into <HI>Haeret,</HI> as they call them, or into Dioceses, under which are many Parishes, heere, if there be any controversies, matters are first tried. And from hence they appeale to the Judge of the <HI>Haeret.</HI> Afterward to the Chan∣cellour, and last of all to the King and Senatours, where it hath a deter∣minate and finall Judgement. They have a written Law, composed by <HI>Woldemare</HI> the first, together with the Bishops and Senators, which is very agreeable to the law of Nature, and not much differing from the <HI>Roman</HI> Lawes, and that causes and suites may sooner have an end, and judgement be given and put in execution, It is provided that Judges, if they doe any wrong or give false judgement, are condemned to lose halfe their goods; whereof the King hath the one part, and the injured partie the other. <HI>Woldemare</HI> the first (except I be deceiv'd) added the Bishops to the Senators, whom <HI>Christianus</HI> the third, for rebellion and certaine other causes did put out againe. The Kings Chancellour, who for the most part followeth the King in the Court, hath seven or eight Noble men adjoyned unto him as Assistants, besides Secretaries and Clerkes; and all businesses are dispatch'd by the King himselfe. But if it be some matter of consequence, as concerning peace or warre, entring into league with forraine Nations, or into consultation concerning the defending of their owne Territories, then the King calleth a Councell of Senators. Neither can the King impose any taxe upon the Kingdome or Countrie, without their consent, and the consent of the Nobles. There is also in this Kingdome a Master of the Exchequer, who colle∣cteth
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
and gathereth all the Revenues of the whole Kingdome, both of Castles, Farmes, and Customes, as well by Sea as by Land. Hee taketh account of them, enquireth into them, and giveth acquittances for the receit of them. Hee hath two Assistants of the Nobilitie, and many Clerkes under him; and for his office hath a yearely stipend or pension.</P>
<P>The third State is of the Clergie, in which there are seven Bishops, as the Bishop of <HI>Lunden,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Roeschild,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Otthon,</HI> of <HI>Rip,</HI> of <HI>Wiburg,</HI> of <HI>Arhuse,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Sleswich,</HI> to whom the o∣ther Canonicall persons have relation. These have the Tenths of the Kingdome; which in divers Countries are divided in a divers manner for the Bishops have an halfe part of the Tenths, and the King an halfe part, the Canonists and Preachers have a part, and a part is contributed toward the building and repairing of Churches. And as concerning the Popes authoritie in this Kingdome, as also in <HI>France,</HI> the ordination of Prelates and Bishops have beene alwayes in the Kings power, as may appeare by the answer of <HI>Woldemare</HI> the first, King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> which heere I have annexed. When the Pope required these and the like pri∣viledges from the King, it is reported, that the King writ back unto him, <HI>Wee have our Kingdome from our Subjects, our life from our Parents, our Reli∣ligion from the Romish Church, which if you will take from us, I send it you by these presents.</HI> And as the wise Decree of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth is praised, pro∣hibiting Ecclesiasticall persons from buying any immoveable thing without the consent of the King, so <HI>Christian</HI> the third as wisely did or∣daine, that the Clergie should not sell any thing without the Kings ex∣presse commandement. In other matters the Clergie-men through the whole kingdome are well provided for by <HI>Christian</HI> the third, of famous memorie, and many Schooles erected in many places, as also two in <HI>Iseland,</HI> where they have likewise a Printing-House. There is but one Universitie in the whole kingdome, called the Universitie of<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">This Citie is called by the <HI>Germans Co∣penhagen,</HI> that is, the Mer∣chants Haven.</NOTE> <HI>Haft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> or <HI>Hafnia,</HI> founded by <HI>Christerne</HI> the first, by permission of Pope <HI>Sixt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in the yeare of Christ 1470: which <HI>Frederick</HI> the second, although hee were seven yeares incumbred with the <HI>Swethish</HI> warres, did so enrich that the yearely revenues thereof are very much.</P>
<P>The fourth State is of the Citizens and Merchants, dwelling in Ci∣ties and Townes. These have proper and peculiar priviledges which they enjoy, besides certaine fields and woods that belong to them; and these doe traffique both by Sea and Land in all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Out of these, as also out of the Countrey-people, the Bishops, the Cano∣nists, the Preachers, and Senators of Cities, the Clerkes of Bands, the Lievtenants of Towres, and the Masters of Ships are chosen, and some of them are Masters of the Customes or Tributes; lastly, of these all lesser Councels of Justice doe consist, one of the Nobility, for the most part, sitting as President.</P>
<P>The fifth State is of the Rustick, or Countrey-people, and there are two sorts of them, the first they call <HI>Freibunden,</HI> that is, Free-holders. These doe hold Lands of Inheritance, yet paying for the same some little free-rent every yeare. These doe also use merchandise and fish∣ing. They are not opprest with doing services, neither doe they pay any taxes, unlesse the Senators of the kingdome doe grant it as a subsi∣die.

The other sort is of those, who doe not possesse goods of inheri∣tance, but doe farme them of the King, the Nobles or Ecclesiasticall persons, and are constrained to doe many services for their Lords, in such manner, as they shall covenant with their Land-lord. These are the chiefe things which I thought good to declare concerning the <HI>State politick of Denmarke;</HI> whereby it appeareth, that the <HI>Danish</HI> Monarchie was, for the most part, well framed: for the free election of the Kings being in the hands of the Nobilitie, and yet notwithstanding out of the royall Progenie, as wee said before: it followeth, that the <HI>Danes</HI> have no civill warres or dissentions, unlesse those which are betweene such as bee of the Blood Royall, which are quickly composed by the media∣tion and helpe of the Nobles; but especially seeing the Kings younger Sonnes can have no part of the kingdome. Moreover, as they are all stiled but Nobles, and know not the titles and names of Barons, Earles, and Dukes, so there are none that have so much wealth and power, as that reposing trust therein, they dare oppose themselves against the Royall Familie; because the Fathers Inheritance is alwayes divided betweene the Sonnes and Daughters. Thus the Kings of <HI>Denmarke</HI> have a flourishing Common-wealth, which may easily bee defended from forraine enemies, whom their Subjects, living in unanimity and con∣cord with them as their naturall Lords, are able to resist both by sea and land.</P>

feasts, the motion of the two great Luminaries, the Sunne and Moone, their places in the Zodiacke every day, and their positions and aspects one toward another. And as these things appeare outwardly, by reason of certaine engines, and wheeles framed within to that purpose, So is there added a covering so made by Art, that as often as the Clocke strikes, two little Images like two Champions do meete together, &amp; do give one another so many blowes as the Clocke striketh strokes. But that which is more wonderfull is this, in the middle of this Table, as it were in a Throne, is placed the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> holding her Infant in her armes: on both sides of her there are, as it were, two Gates, and before her feet a Theater of a semicircular forme, with the arch thereof turned toward the spectators, within there is a devise with the Images of the three wisemen, having every one their servant. The whole engine being turned as he pleaseth that keepeth it, straight way the Ima∣ges come forth. And before the rest there comes as it were a threatning Herald, who brandishing his sword knocks at the left doare, that being open'd hee goeth forward while two Images seeme to blow two trum∣pets before him. He that is the first of the wisemen, walketh with a state∣ly pace. But when hee commeth to the Virgin <HI>Maries</HI> Image hee reve∣rently bends himselfe unto it, as if hee did adore her. And so also do the other two. The servants goe on without doing any obedience or ma∣king any shew of reverence, the last of them shutteth the right gate, that the sound of the Clocke when that is shut may be heard more plainly.

It is in compasse 8160 paces, every pace being 5 foote, so that the whole circuit of it is equall unto two common <HI>German,</HI> 18 <HI>English</HI> miles. This Island being placed in the most famous strait of the whole Kingdome through which many ships saile out of the Easterne into the Westerne Sea: and on the contrarie with a gooly prospect hath in view many chiefe Townes of this Kingdome, which stands as it were round about it; in <HI>Zeland Hafnia,</HI> 12 miles distant from it South, South∣west also <HI>Helsinger,</HI> (where those ships that saile or passe by, do pay cu∣stome or tribute) and the Castle <HI>Cronaburg</HI> both distant from it on the Northwest 8 miles, <HI>Helsingburg</HI> which lies on the shoare of <HI>Scania,</HI> is as

They held that the Gods did dwell in Woods and Groves, and that they were to please them by sacrificing unto them in those places: and to pray unto them to send them raine or faire weather. They held that all wilde Beasts, especially the <HI>Alces</HI> living in these Woods, were to be reveren∣ced as the servants of the Gods, and therefore they were to abstain from injuring of them. They beleeved that the Sunne and Moone were the chiefest of all the Gods. They did worship Thunder and Lightnings ac∣cording to the opinion of the Heathens, and were of opinion that they might by prayers raise or calme stormes and tempests. They used a Goate for their sacrifice, in regard of the generative and fruitfull nature of that creature. They said that the Gods did inhabite in excellent faire trees, as Oakes, and the like: wherefore they would not cut downe such trees, but did religiously worship them as the houses and seates of the Gods.

For in</HI> Christmas, <HI>in the night time, such a companie of men-wolves doe ga∣ther themselves together, and shew such fierie cruelty both towards men and o∣ther creatures, which are not wilde by nature, that the Inhabitants of this Coun∣trie doe receive more detriment and losse from these than from true and natu∣rall wolves.

than fabulous, as also those things be which the <HI>Lydians,</HI> the <HI>Thra∣cians, Rhodians, Phrygians, Cyprians, Phoenicians, Aegyptians, Milesians, Carians, Lesbians,</HI> and <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> are reported to have performed succes∣sively in this countrey. But those things are more certaine, which Wri∣ters have recorded were heretofore atchieved by the <HI>Carthaginians, Ro∣mans, Gothes, Vandals, Alani, Swethlanders, Huns,</HI> and their Kings, for that the Writers of them were either present at those actions, or else came to the knowledge of them by the faithfull relation of others. Of these things therefore I will speake briefly, and thus it was. When the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> did rule all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and had all things under their owne command, the Senate and people of <HI>Rome</HI> did send first of all the two <HI>Scipioes</HI> against them with an army of Souldiers, in the beginning of the second <HI>Punick</HI> warre: who were slaine in the seventh yeare of that war, <HI>Q. Fulvius Flaccus</HI> and <HI>Ap. Claudius Pulcher</HI> being Consuls. The next year <HI>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</HI> being sent next to his Father &amp; Uncle, did performe many things very prosperously, and first of all made a Province of it, <HI>Q. Caecilius Metellus,</HI> and <HI>L. Veturius Philo</HI> being Con∣suls. First, <HI>Asdrubal</HI> and <HI>Mago Carthaginian</HI> Captaines, being overthrown and put to flight in the battell, neere to the Citie <HI>Baetula</HI> (which is sup∣posed to have been in that place where now <HI>Baëca</HI> and <HI>Vbeda</HI> are seated) and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armies beaten out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> hee established a league of friendship with <HI>Syphax</HI> King of the <HI>Massilians,</HI> who is now called <HI>Bile∣dulgerid;</HI> a litle after hee compelled the rebellious people of <HI>Spaine</HI> to yeeld themselves unto him, and having made a league with <HI>Massanissa</HI> King of the <HI>Masaesulians,</HI> and the <HI>Gaditanes,</HI> hee committed the govern∣ment of the Province to <HI>L. Lentulus</HI> and <HI>L. Manlius Acidinus,</HI> and retur∣ned to <HI>Rome.</HI> After <HI>Scipio, L. Cornelius Lentulus</HI> the Proconsul did go∣verne <HI>Spaine,</HI> and after many prosperous acts and atchievements, entred the Citie in triumph. Three yeares after, <HI>C. Cornelius, Cethegus,</HI> and <HI>Minu∣cius Rufus</HI> being Consuls, the two <HI>Spaines</HI> were first bounded, and two new Pretors sent into them, <HI>C. Sempronius Tuditanus</HI> into the hither <HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>M. Helvetius Blasio</HI> into the farther. Two yeares being scarce∣ly past, so great a warre began in <HI>Spaine,</HI> that it was necessarie, that a Consul should be sent out with an Army: <HI>Marcus Portius Cato</HI> Consul being allotted to goe into the hither part, did so appease and quiet rebellion, that the Proconsul in regard thereof triumphed. This is that <HI>Cato,</HI> who, as <HI>Livie</HI> writeth and others, by a wonderfull stratagem, did throw downe the wals of many <HI>Spanish</HI> Cities in one day. After <HI>Cato</HI>'s victorie, <HI>Spaine</HI> was diversly possessed, and many times lost and regained againe, so that there were above 30 triumphs for victories obtained heere. They did not begin to pay any taxe, before the time of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> who having by long continuance of warres tamed all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and overthrowne the <HI>Cantabrians</HI> and <HI>Asturians</HI> that had longest of all made resistance, divided the whole Countrie into three Provinces, <HI>Baetica,</HI> so called from the River <HI>Baetis, Lusitania,</HI> and <HI>Tarraconensis,</HI> so called from its citie <HI>Tarracon;</HI> and every one of these have their Diocesses or Circles of jurisdiction. In <HI>Baetica</HI> there are foure Diocesses <HI>Gaditana, Corduben∣sis, Astigitana,</HI> and <HI>Hispalensis.

Thus things by degrees being changed, the chiefest Provinces were under the <HI>Romans</HI> command, even untill the Consulship of <HI>Honorius</HI> the third, and <HI>Thee∣dosius</HI> the third.

<P>And lastly, the Haven of <HI>Venus,</HI> so called by <HI>Mela,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountaines.</NOTE> which lyeth at the foote of the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> hills. Now followe the mountaines; the chiefe whereof are the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> mountaines dividing <HI>Spaine</HI> from <HI>France.

Some would have them so called from fire, or because they are often struck with thunder, or because all the woods thereof (as <HI>Diodorus</HI> writeth in his sixt Booke) were heretofore set on fire by sheep-heards, and so burnt downe. <HI>Silius</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Poët doth give them this deno∣mination from a maide called <HI>Pyrena,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Bebryx,</HI> whom <HI>Hercules</HI> lay withall upon this mountaine, and being afterward torne to pieces by wild beasts, she was buried here.

The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are by nature hot and drie, swarthe-co∣loured, to helpe which the women use a kinde of painting: they are well limb'd and strong set. They are the most superstitious of all people, so that other people doe learne from them both ceremonies, complements, and large titles. They have a great dexteritie in concealing their thoughts both by silence and dissimulation. They have a kinde of an affected gra∣vitie, which maketh them incurre the hatred of all other Nations, which, as <HI>Marianus</HI> sheweth, is an individuall concomitant or companion to great Kingdomes. The women are not very fruitfull in bearing children: they abstaine much from wine, and are seldome seene abroade, as imita∣ting therein the <HI>Roman</HI> Matrons. They use strangers discurteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly, and in forraine Countries they will reverence, prayse, and extoll one another. They are great observers of Justice, so that Justice is administred to all, even from the highest to the lowest: and so great is the painfull industrie of Magistrates, that there are few or no robberies committed. Beside, they keepe their hands free from bloud, and other wicked acts, and who soever offendeth the Lawes, or doth trespasse against any one, though never so meane, is punished for it. They are still attempting some greate matter, for having supprest their enemies at home, and overthrowne the <HI>Saracens,</HI> they seeke for to discover and get for their King the most pote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> parts of the world. When two or three meete together, of what place or condition soever, they alwayes discourse of the Common-wealth and se∣rious affaires, they seeke wayes how to weaken their enemies force, they devise stratagems, and invent a thousand engines, which they open and make knowne to the Captaines. In the field they can endure both hunger thirst and labour. In battle and matters of warre they are more politick than stout: they are of a light body, and being lightly armed, they not onely easily pursue their enemies, but when they are put to it, they can ea∣sily save themselves by flight, (alwayes meditating on some militarie or warlike designe). In their feastes and banquets at home they are frugall, sober, and content with a little, but abroade they have more delicate fare. They use handsome convenient garments, well made &amp; fashioned. <HI>Spai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> doth affoord to the neighbour Countries, and also to remote Nations, Silke-wooll, Cloath of all kindes, Salt, Sugar, Honey, Orenges, Pome-Granats, Lemmons, pickled Olives, Capers, Grapes, Figges, Pruines, Almonds, Chesnuts, Anny-seed, Cumming-seed, Coriander-seed, Rice, Saffron, Oyle, Waxe, Alume, Vermilion, Purple, Saltfish, Bay-berries, preserv'd Fruits of all sorts, Alablaster, Corall, Gold, Silver, Iron, Steele, Tinne, Copper, Leade, Dying Oade, Quick-silver, Gotten, pretious stones, Aromatickes and sweet Spices, which are brought from the <HI>Indies</HI> and other places.

Now when <HI>Sanctius</HI> had ruled about sixe yeares, and was at last beheaded by <HI>Vellidus</HI> through trecherie, <HI>Alphonsus</HI> who lived as a banisht man with the King of the <HI>Moores</HI> at <HI>Toledo,</HI> did not onely recover the Kingdome of <HI>Legio,</HI> which his father gave him by Will, but also got the Kingdome of <HI>Castile, Gallicia,</HI> and <HI>Portugall. Alphonsus</HI> had three children lawfully begot on three wives, by <HI>Isabell</HI> Queen of <HI>France</HI> hee had <HI>Sanctia,</HI> who was married to the Earle <HI>Rodoricke,</HI> who brought new Colonies into the Citie which is commonly called <HI>Ciudad-R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣go;</HI> by <HI>Zaida</HI> a <HI>Moore,</HI> daughter to the King of <HI>Sevill,</HI> he had <HI>Sanctius,</HI> who was slaine in a battell against the <HI>Saracens;</HI> and lastly, by <HI>Constantia</HI> he had <HI>Vrraca,</HI> who out living <HI>Sanctius</HI> and <HI>Sanctia</HI> (who dyed without issue) af∣ter shee had beene wife to <HI>Raimundus Berengarius</HI> Earle of <HI>Tolosa,</HI> marri∣ed <HI>Alphonsus</HI> King of <HI>Aragon,</HI> and had an heire by him who was after∣ward. <HI>Alphonsus</HI> the seventh, the most powerfull King of all his predeces∣sours, and one that deserved to be called Emperour of <HI>Spaine.</HI> From th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time <HI>Gallicia, Castile,</HI> and <HI>Legio</HI> have had alwaies but one King.

of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Although the Church which the Citie of <HI>Hispalis</HI> hath built in our age, doth exceed all the rest for greatnesse, although the Church of <HI>Toledo</HI> surpasse the rest for treasure, ornaments, and glasse windowes, and the Church of <HI>Compostella</HI> for strong building, for the miracles of Saint <HI>Iames,</HI> &amp; other things: yet the Church of <HI>Legio</HI> (in my judgement) is to be preferred before them all for admirable structure and building, which hath a Chappell joyning to it, in which lye buried seven and thirtie Kings, and one Emperour of <HI>Spaine.</HI> It is worthy of memorie that this Citie was the first from which about the yeare 716. the recoverie of <HI>Spaine,</HI> (which formerly the <HI>Moores</HI> and <HI>Saracens</HI> almost wholly pos∣sessed) was begun.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>NDALUZIA is a part of <HI>Hispania Baetica,</HI> it is supposed that it was heretofore called <HI>Vandalia</HI> from the <HI>Vandals,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The name and whence de∣rived.</NOTE> a people of <HI>Germany,</HI> who formerly came into these parts. Therefore some having searched more nearely into the name do thinke it was called <HI>Andaluzia, quasi Wendenhays,</HI> that is, the house of the <HI>Vandals,</HI> yet <HI>Marius Aretius</HI> doth thinke it was called <HI>Andaluzia quasi ante Lusitania,</HI> the letters being somewhat chan∣ged. On the East it hath <HI>Granada,</HI> on the North New <HI>Castile,</HI> on the West it is bounded with the Diocesses of <HI>Badaios</HI> and <HI>Silvis,</HI> &amp; the River <HI>Anas;</HI> and on the South it looketh toward the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea. The chiefe part of it is the jurisdiction of <HI>Hispalis.</HI> This hath on the East <HI>Corduba,</HI> on the West <HI>Algarbia,</HI> on the North it cleaveth to that part of <HI>Portugall</HI> which is called <HI>Magistratus S.

Here is great store of all kindes of Cat∣tell, and especially of Cunnies. Wee said before, that <HI>Andaluzia</HI> tooke that name from the <HI>Vandalls,</HI> because they being driven out by the <HI>Gothes</HI> seated themselves in this place: though afterward being thrust out from hence, they went into <HI>Africke.</HI> Thus it was: <HI>Rodericke</HI> the 25 King of the <HI>Gothes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ancient Government.</NOTE> in whom the line of the Kings of the <HI>Gothes</HI> was ex∣tinguisht, did send one <HI>Iulianus</HI> an Earle to <HI>Mauritania Tingitana</HI> as Go∣vernour thereof: and in his absence did violate his daughters chastitie, making a whore of her; which when her father heard, he called the <HI>Sa∣racens</HI> out of <HI>Africke,</HI> thinking thereby to ease his just sorrow, by reven∣ging it on the King who was the cause thereof.

of <HI>Turia</HI> not farre from <HI>Valentia</HI> stood <HI>Saguntum,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> affir∣meth to be a Citie of the <HI>Heditani, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> doe place it a mile off from the Sea; <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth it <HI>Saguntus, Stephanus Zacynthus,</HI> and <HI>An∣toninus</HI> corruptly <HI>Secundum</HI> and <HI>Secunthum.</HI> The most doe thinke it now to be the same with <HI>Morvedere,</HI> being so called, as some suppose, from the ancient wals thereof. <HI>Appianus</HI> maketh it the Colonie of the <HI>Za∣cynthi;</HI> some doe suppose, that <HI>Saguntis</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Hercules</HI> was the builder of it, and some would have it named from the <HI>Iberian Sagi.

It seemeth by <HI>Plinie,</HI> that the <HI>Saguntini</HI> did heretofore reverence <HI>Diana;</HI> being brought thither by the <HI>Zacynthians</HI> their Progenitors, two hun∣dred yeares before the destruction of <HI>Troy.

<P>These things may suffice which have beene spoken hitherto concer∣ning <HI>Spaine.</HI> But yet I thinke it fit to adde, by way of conclusion, the ex∣cellent testimonie of a <HI>French-man</HI> concerning this Kingdome, wherein whatsoever wee have hitherto said in praise and commendation there∣of, is briefly and pithily repeated by way of recapitulation. This <HI>French-man</HI> whom I mentioned, was called in Latine <HI>Pacatus,</HI> who writ a most learned <HI>Panegyrick</HI> to <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperour being a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> in which hee speaketh to this purpose. <Q>Now it will appeare, that hee is declared Prince, who ought to bee chosen of all men, and out of all men. For first, <HI>Spaine</HI> is thy Mother, a Land more happie than all o∣ther Countries, (the great Fabricator and Maker of all things hath beene more favourable, in enriching and adorning this Countrie, than the Countries of others Nations) for it is neither obnoxious to the Summers heate, nor subject to the Northerne cold, but is seated in the temperate Climate, and by the witty diligence of Nature, it is, as it were, an other world, as being enclosed on one side with the <HI>Py∣renaean</HI> Mountaines, heere with the Ocean, and there with the shores of the <HI>Tyrrhenian</HI> Sea. Besides, adde to this the many famous Cities which are therein, the whole Countries being either tilled, or full of fruites and flocks, the gold-bearing Rivers that water it, and the spar∣kling pretious stones that enrich it; I know that Poets in their Fables which they have invented to please the eare, have attributed miracu∣lous things to some Nations, which whether they are true or not, yet are very strange: neither doe I now seeke out the truth: Let <HI>Gargara</HI> (as it is written) yeeld a great increase of corne: let <HI>Menavia</HI> be pray∣sed for her flocks, <HI>Campania</HI> for the Mountaine <HI>Gaurano, Lydia</HI> for the River <HI>Pactolus, Spaine</HI> hath every thing that is praise-worthy. It brin∣geth forth hardie Souldies, expert Captaines, eloquent Oratours, and famous Poets. This Country is the Mother of Judges and Princes: this Countrie yeelded the Emperours <HI>Trajan</HI> and <HI>Adrian,</HI> and the Empire is beholding to this Countrie for thee. Let <HI>Crete,</HI> which boa∣steth of <HI>Iupiters</HI> being nursed in it when hee was a childe, give place to this Countrie: let <HI>Delos,</HI> honoured by the birth of two Gods, and noble <HI>Thebes</HI> of <HI>Hercules</HI> who was brought up there, yeeld unto it.

The use and utility of Geographie in reading Histories and retaining them, is greater than that I neede to make any adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tion or description of; but there is an other greater dignitie belonging unto it, if it be directed to its proper end, and rightly used, and that is, it doth much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the knowledge of Politick Government, when the situation of a place is in onely described, but also the nature and condition thereof, which is sometimes the office of a Geographer to doe. And as that Painter doth not satisfie him∣selfe in his profession, which delineates a man according to the proportion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> limbes, but doth not with colours and physiognomicall shadowes expresse his na∣ture and affections; so hee shall but figure out an unpleasing and, as it were, a dead Geographicall body or carcasse, who having set downe places according is their symmetrie and proportion, shall not shew their Politicall respect which they beare one to an other. Wherefore I esteem'd it as a thing chiefly to be respected, that in every severall Countrie the nature and order of Government append<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thereunto, should be prefixed before the Tables themselves, whereby I might somewhat benefit those who are studious of politicall and publick affaires. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our writing be in many places imperfect, defective, or erronious, the Read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> needes not wonder, for the formes of things throughout all Nations are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣tant, neither have I found all that are, purposely described by any Author; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even as I could gather them out of Histories, I have collected them, which thou maist partly understand the order and manner of every government, and so maist supply and correct that which is wanting in thy owne Countrie, which if every one would doe, how profitable would Geographie be to Students? That are three heads especially to be considered in the administration of Kingdomes, Principalities, and Provinces, namely the Ecclesiasticall State, the Political State, and the Administration of Iustice: first therefore according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Countrie described in the Table, I will reckon up how many members <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parts there are of the Politicall State thereof, according to the order of dignitie as they are observed there. Secondly in distinguishing Noble-mens places (sit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the whole government is in the hands of the Nobilitie) I will in the first place reckon those who are Feudals to the Prince, and afterward those that are free, descending still in order from the highest degree of Nobilitie, as Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Lords. Thirdly, I will shew into what Prefectures the Countrie is divided: and I suppose that by these three things the Politicall State will be suf∣ficiently
<PB N="239" REF="212"/>
declared. In the administration of Iustice, the juridicall Diocesses shall be noted, and the higher Senates to which appeale may be made. Lastly, in the Ecclesiasticall State, the Archbishops, if there be any, shall bee placed first, and then the suffragan Bishops which are under them, as also those which are suffra∣gans to others. To reckon up all these things requires much studie, but seeing for want of matter it may be briefly delivered, I will performe what I may, that so I may stirre up lovers of their countrie to emulate a greater perfection in their writings. The severall places shall be noted with numbers, that they may be straight-way found out in the following Table; the first number shall containe the degrees and minutes of Longitude, which shall be sought out in the Northerne or Southerne side of the Table, the later shall have the numbers of Latitude, which are to be sought on the Westerne or Easterne side. From these bounds, heere by the direction of the Meridian, and there of the Parallel of La∣titude, you shall come at last to their intersection, and so finde out the place propounded. The situation of those places which are in the description of the generall Tables ought to be sought from thence. But if so be that some names are not found in the table following, it was the fault of the Chorographer who delineated it, for the right designing and placing of principalities and domini∣ons is not to be omitted. The rule and government of Countries is in the power of the Nobilitie, and therefore it is both profitable and delightfull to know and distinguish their severall degrees, and the proper conditions of them. The highest degree is that of Emperour or King, whom in order doe follow the degrees of Duke, Earle, Baron, the militarie Tribune, whom the <HI>Low-country-men</HI> call <HI>Banderheer, quasi Bendae,</HI> that is, Lord of the Troupes, which he leadeth under his Banner. After him is the Knight, or hee that hath attained to be of the Horsemans Order, whom the <HI>French-men</HI> doe call <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and the <HI>Low-country-men Ridder.</HI> In the last place is <HI>vn Escuyer,</HI> who beareth Armes, but hath attained to no publick dignitie. There are three degrees of Earles, the first whereof the <HI>French-men</HI> call <HI>Viconte,</HI> who excelleth the rest in dignity &amp; priviledges, <HI>Ludovic. Guic.</HI> would have him now called a <HI>Bur∣grave.</HI> And though this Order of Earles in time hath remitted something of its honour, yet in the beginning it was of more excellent dignitie, as the descrip∣tion thereof shall by and by declare. In the second degree is the Earle Provinci∣all, who is called in <HI>Dutch, Landgrave.</HI> In the third degree is the Marquesse, or Marckgrave. These are the speciall degrees and orders of Nobilitie, among which the government of every Countrie is divided. There are also some diffe∣rences in these degrees which might occasion a subdivision, but such as are di∣stinguisht rather by priviledges than by forme of government. Yet moreover I will deliver the lawfull differences and conditions of every order which I have mentioned, as I have found them in a certaine <HI>French</HI> Booke, entituled <HI>La di∣vision du monde:</HI> deducing their creation from the lowest degree of Nobili∣ty, whence their proprieties and order of government doe most clearely appeare. A Knight, saith this author, or a <HI>Chevalier</HI> shall be thus created of one that was a Squire before, and bore armes in his Escutcheon. If hee, having long fol∣lowed the warres, exercised armes, beene present at many conflicts, hath suffi∣cient meanes to maintaine the state of his degree, and commeth of a great, noble, and rich Familie; then in any skirmish hee shall make knowne his request to the Generall of the Army, or to some valiant generous Knight, and when the bat∣tell is ended, hee shall come unto the said Generall or Knight, and entreate him
<PB N="240" REF="213"/>
in the name of God and S. <HI>George,</HI> to give him the Order of Knighth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Whereupon hee shall draw out his Sword and strike him thrice with it, saying: I make thee a Knight (or <HI>Chevalier</HI>) in the name of God and S. <HI>George,</HI> faith∣fully to defend the Faith, Iustice, the Church, Widowes, and Orphanes. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the supplicant, although he be valiant, yet be poore, hee shall not bee admitted unlesse so much yearely revenues be assigned and given unto him, as is necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to preserve and maintaine the honour and dignitie of his Order. And this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first degree of Nobility arising from the lowest. A militarie Tribune called <HI>een Bander-heer</HI> shall be made of a Knight, if having long followed the warres hee hath lands and revenues enough to keepe and maintaine fiftie Gentle-men in pay, that is, one Band of horse-men which shall follow his colours in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. For no man can set up a Colours or standerd of his owne, unlesse hee can bring into the field at his owne charge a Troupe or Band at the least of fiftie Gentle-men, who receive pay from him. A Baron may bee created of a Knight, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Noble Squire, which hath foure Castles in his dominion, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> within himselfe, for then the King may conferre a Baronrie upon him: yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot give him this honour, unlesse he hath behaved himselfe valiantly in the warres. Therefore after the first conflict or battell he is made a Knight, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the second a militarie Tribune, and after the third a Baron. The degree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earle is the next, and first an Earle of the Marches, whom wee call a Marq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, that is, Marcgrave. And hee may be created one, who hath two or three B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣nies included in one Dukedome, and that by the Duke in whose precincts they lye. Hee may be made a Provinciall Earle, that is, a Landgrave, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foure Baronies in one Dukedome, by the Duke or the King, by the instances permission of the Duke, Hee may bee made a Vicount, who hath five Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or more within one Dukedome, or which are joyned together by vicinitie of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tuation. And (by the Kings permission) he may be created by the Duke and great solemnitie. But if the King himselfe be present the Pnincipality is more honourable. The Duke who is to be made of an Earle, must first possesse in the Kingdome wherein hee is to bee crowned, foure principall Counties, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have in every one of them foure other Counties or Baronies, which must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bound to doe fealtie and service to them. But he must be crowned by the King or Emperour whose subject hee is, his Hatt being adorned with pearles and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣tious Stones, in the most flourishing Citie of his territories, and that in a gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assembly of Princes, Dukes, Earles, and Barons, a solemne festivall being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> held, as it is the custome at the Coronation of Kings. Hee that is to bee King, must have foure Dukedomes lying neere together subject unto him, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dukedome foure Cities, which hee alone governeth, in every one of these f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cities one Archbishop, and under euery one of these againe ten Provincial Bishops. Hee being endowed and adorned with these dominions and dignitie shall come unto the Emperours Majestie as to his superiour, or shall invite l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly an honourable Embassage to come unto him, and so desire to be crowned by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But this seemes to be a later manner of electing the Kings and other Princes, for as long as those wandring Nations of the <HI>Gothes, Vandals, Longobardes,</HI> and many others did bring in their Kings with them, they did not measure the royall dignitie by large possession of lands, but by the multitude and strength<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the people which they brought in. Neither was there any other choise of Dukes, who first began to bee instituted by <HI>Longinus</HI> Governour of <HI>Ravenna</HI> in the yeare <HI>569,</HI> and afterward by the <HI>Longobards,</HI> than for their valour and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="241" REF="213"/>
atchievements. Adde to this that which <HI>Paulus Aemilius</HI> witnesseth, namely, that Dukes and Earles were in the beginning made Prefects by the King over Nations and Cities on this condition, onely that as often as there was occasion they should bee dismissed or changed. Now how could the afore said Lawes of creating Princes (which are measured by, and doe claime the hereditarie posses∣sion of Lands) be in force at that time, seeing Dukedomes and Counties were conferr'd by Kings and Emperours as a temporary bountie? Therefore though the precise time of the Institution of them cannot be shewed (for that <HI>French</HI> Booke doth mention nothing of it) yet it is very likely, that under <HI>Otto</HI> the se∣cond Emperour, or about the yeare one thousand, or a litle after, that manner of constituting and confirming dignities was ordained by the Monarches. For e∣ven untill <HI>Otto</HI> the second, every Prince according to his power and ambition, did aspire to greater dignitie and royall Majestie. So out of one Kingdome of <HI>Lotharingia</HI> or <HI>Lorreine,</HI> which being extended from the <HI>Rhene</HI> even to the River <HI>Scaldis,</HI> was bounded with the <HI>Friesland</HI> Sea, and belonged to <HI>Lothari∣us</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Lodovicus Pius,</HI> more Kingdomes did afterward arise, name∣ly the <HI>transjurane Burgundie,</HI> which being extended from the Mountaine <HI>Jura</HI> even to the <HI>Alpes,</HI> did containe all <HI>Helvetia,</HI> the <HI>Rauraci,</HI> the <HI>Allobro∣ges,</HI> and the <HI>transjurane Burgundians:</HI> and the Kingdome of <HI>Provence</HI> which did containe some part of <HI>Burgundie</HI> and <HI>Sabaudia,</HI> and was afterward called the Kingdome of <HI>Arelatum,</HI> of which at this day the Elector of <HI>Trevers</HI> is called the Archchancellour. It did also containe the Kingdome of <HI>Lotharin∣gia,</HI> now also called <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> and other Kingdomes betweene the <HI>Rhene</HI> and <HI>Scaldis,</HI> even to the <HI>Friesland</HI> Sea; and heretofore it was called the King∣dome of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">It was called <HI>Austrasia,</HI> ei∣ther from one <HI>Austrasius</HI> a President, whō <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour set over this coun∣trey, or from the word <HI>Au∣ster,</HI> because it is more East∣ward than any other part of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Austrasia.</HI> Againe, this Kingdome of <HI>Lotharingia, Charles</HI> the <HI>bald,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Lodovick</HI> did part betweene them, both of them preser∣ving the title of a King in all places. I omit the other Kingdomes which sprung up in that age by the desire and affectation of Soveraignty. But the Emperour <HI>Otto</HI> the second did divide <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> having tooke away the name of a Kingdome, into nine Dukedomes and Earledomes, as it were, into members pull'd and separated from the body, as <HI>Cuspinian</HI> hath it, and having made a division thereof <HI>Anno 981,</HI> he first made <HI>Charles</HI> the Brother of <HI>Lotharius</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> Duke of that Countrie which is now called <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> as <HI>Richardus Wissenburgius</HI> doth speake more at large. It seemeth that after that time the arbitrarie erection and raising of Kingdomes and Principalities did faile, the Monarches now contriving how to establish a setled Empire, which consisteth in the just proportion and harmonie of its parts, as in man the parts of the body to the head. Therefore that some order might be perpetually kept in Principality and in government; I suppose that at length about the same time which I mentioned before, these afore-said Lawes were devised. And so, Reader, thou hast the distinct Degrees of all the Nobilitie, and the differences of their dignities. Now if thou observe how Provinces in every Kingdome are divided in respect of them, how the government and administration of the whole, and in what proportion it is distributed among these degrees, what is every ones peculiar office, what is the habitude or relation which they have one to an other, and especially to their head, you shall behold either an excellent har∣mony tending to the preservation of peace and tranquillity, strength and power, riches and state, vertue and wisedome to the Majestie of a Kingdome, and the enlarging of territories; or a confused disorder tending to instabilitie, declina∣tion,
<PB N="242" REF="214"/>
destruction or inundation, according as there are divers kindes of govern∣ment. If those matters which thou shalt see or judgest did succeed ill, thou m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> consider whence that ill successe proceeded; but if thou finde any prosperous and successefull event, search the cause thereof, so thou shalt behold which is the best policie in governing of Common-weales, and shalt studie Geographie with more profit.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="commentary on tables">
<HEAD>An Admonition concerning the use of the Tables following.</HEAD>
<P>WHen it was my purpose to reduce all Geographie to the consideration of the Heavens, that the just symmetrie of places, as they lye in the Sphericall figure of the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, might as neere as could be observed <HI>in plano</HI> or on a plaine superficies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> due proportion of degrees of Longitude was to be set down, according to the degrees of Latitude. Seeing therefore the Table could co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> but a few degrees of Latitude, I have reduced the proportion th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> almost to the midle Parallel of the Table, so that what the propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is of that Parallel to the Meridian, the same should be the proportion of the degrees of Longitude in the same Parallel to the degrees of La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tude, and so all the Meridians are Parallels one to an other. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; there were more degrees of Latitude, because there is a great distere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of proportion in the Parallels both in the top and the bottome unto the Meridian, lest the symmetrie of places should not be true, I have chosen two Parallels almost equally distant from the midle and the extreames, to the proportion whereof, I have drawne the Meridians to designe and note out the degrees of Longitude, which are not then Parallels, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> according to the greater or lesser distance of the assumed Parallels, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> doe encline more or lesse one to an other and to the midle Meridian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Table.</P>
<P>Moreover thou shalt finde the degrees of Latitude and Longitude designed and set forth on the sides of the Tables, and for the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the degrees of Latitude on either side of the Table, and of Longitude on the top and bottome, seeing according to the usuall manner of Geo∣graphers wee place the North on the higher part. But if the Countrie to be described be more extended toward the South and North, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> toward the East and West, then commonly wee place the West up∣ward. Howsoever it be made the East and West sides shall alwayes re∣present unto thee the degrees of Latitude, the other two sides the de∣grees of Longitude. And all the degrees are divided into 60 parts which they call minutes, sometimes into single parts, when the magni∣tude will permit, sometimes into two, five, or ten. This foundation being laid, wee have followed the best descriptions in delineating of Coun∣tries, in which I had much helpe from a famous Measurer of Countries, and a most diligent Geographer to the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> called <HI>Christi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Grothenius,</HI> who had viewed many Countries, and described them more largely and exactly than any other, and also from a most diligent Geo∣grapher
<PB N="243" REF="214"/>
to the King of <HI>Spaine Abraham Ortelius,</HI> who was candor and curtesie it selfe, and who, in evidence thereof, liberally communicated unto mee what Tables soever hee had gotten, though he had the same purpose that I intended. Those who besides did helpe mee any thing at all, I will mention in due place, so that Students may give them their deserved praise, and I may not bee found ungratefull. And whatsoever hath beene offerr'd mee by others, and I found out by my owne diligent search, I have compar'd together, that as neere as may bee I might set forth accurate descriptions: yet in one thing which I chiefly desired I am defective, namely in an exact numbring and reckoning up of Prin∣cipalities &amp; Noble-mens places, which are much sought for in Tables that are set forth: therefore (READER) thou must pardon that defect, and vouchsafe to helpe mee in describing the Politicall Order of the Nobilitie, and in shewing their places, names, and qualities, which will be an honour and grace unto thy name. Litle round circles doe shew the true situation of every place, from whence their distance is to be ta∣ken, and these have some markes whereby places are distinguisht one from an other. The Villages are marked onely by round circles: where wee meete with a Castle, wee marke it in this manner <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/>, and where with Friaries with a Crosse thus ♁: Townes have two Towres at least, and Villages of note where Noble-men reside one. These things wee ob∣served as notes. And wee have taken easie markes for distinction, that so any may supply those things which are omitted.</P>
<P>If any one would finde out the Longitude and Latitude of any place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How by the Mappe to finde out the Longi∣tude and Lati∣tude.</NOTE> hee shall do it where the Meridians are Parallels, by taking with a paire of Compasses the distance thereof from the one side of the Table, and by applying the Compasse so opened to the other side. If you have ta∣ken the distance from the East side, the Compasse from the same side in the North side will shew the degree and minute of Longitude. But if you have the distance from the North side, it will shew you the Lati∣tude in the East side. When the Meridians are not Parallels, the Lati∣tude of a place shall bee found out in the same manner, as in universall Tables, where the Parallels are circular, for the distance of the place taken from the next Parallel will shew the same in the East side. But the Longitude is to be sought out with a thread or ruler laid upon the place, and turned about, untill on the North and South side the same minute of the same degree be on either side designed, and whatsoever that is, is the Longitude of the place assumed.</P>
<P>The miles in divers Countries do differ much, therefore if you please to compare them one to an other, bring them with your Compasses to the degrees of the Meridian, and then finde out how many miles are comprehended in one degree, and you shall see how many miles of one countrie, and how many miles of an other countrie doe make up one degree; so you shall finde the common <HI>German</HI> miles (fifteene whereof are in one degree) foure times larger than the <HI>Italian</HI> miles, and double as much to the <HI>Swethish</HI> and <HI>Westphalian</HI> miles.</P>
<P>Sometimes you shall find a line joyned to a litle Circle, thus <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> which sheweth the name pertaining to the place, being therefore added that you may know what name belongs to every place.</P>

In breadth it is almost 285 miles; the compasse of it is above a thousand and twentie; and this is the quantity of it, the quality followeth. It lyeth under part of the fifth Climate, all the sixth and seventh, and part of the eigth, betweene the degrees of latitude fortie one and fiftie three, and of longitude 20 and 38.

The Nobilitie of <HI>France</HI> doe in generall follow the studies of good lear∣ning, with earnest diligence and continuall paines, so that they excell in all kindes of Disciplines and Arts.

Now I come to speake of their manners: <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> doe witnesse, that the <HI>French-men</HI> are very sharpe-witted, and reasonable good Schollers. <HI>Symmachus</HI> in many places doth commend their studies in good letters and learning. <HI>Marcus Portius Cato, Originum lib.</HI> 2. saith, that the most part doe follow two things very industriously, to wit, Warfare and Eloquence, that we may know that the ancient <HI>French</HI> did carrie away the glory of elo∣quence from other Nations. <HI>Strabo</HI> doth attribute to them a curteous Nature, voyde of malice. <HI>Iulianus</HI> an eye witnesse doth report of them, that they know not how to flatter, but that they live freely and justly with all men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ners.</NOTE> They have no more knowledge of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> than serveth them for marriages for procreation, and for the moderate drinking of their owne wines. Those things which some speake on the contrarie, are to be esteemed as rayling speeches, proceeding from an envious minde. For who seeth not, that hath read ancient Writers concerning the disposition of the <HI>French-men,</HI> and compar'd it with what it is at this present, that that is fals which <HI>Servius</HI> reporteth? name∣ly, that the <HI>French-men</HI> are dull-witted; and that which <HI>Iulius Firmicus</HI> annexeth, to wit, that they are blockish; and that of <HI>Iulianus,</HI> who for∣getting himselfe, saith, that they are stupid and rustick; that of <HI>Polybius,</HI> who saith, that they doe not give their mindes to Learning and good Arts. That which <HI>Diodorus, Athenaeus,</HI> and <HI>Clement Alexandrinus</HI> doe a∣vouch, namely, that they are unfaithfull, given to gluttonie and drun∣kennesse; that which <HI>Livie</HI> and <HI>Polybius</HI> report, to wit, that they are soft and effeminate; that of <HI>Mela,</HI> who affirmeth, that they are desirous of

gold, ambitious, proude, and superstitious; that of <HI>Solinus,</HI> who saith, that they are vaine bablers: and lastly that which <HI>Plutarch</HI> speaketh is the life of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> namely that they are insatiably covetous of money. Neverthelesse it is confest, that the <HI>French-men</HI> may be corrupted with many vices, by having commerce and traffique with other Nations. <HI>Florus</HI> saith <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 10. that no man can say, that the <HI>French</HI> are one∣ly fierce, seeing they deale fradulently, and by wiles. <HI>Ammianus lib.</HI> 15. sheweth, that they are quarrellous: <HI>Diodorus</HI> doth reprehend the <HI>French-men</HI> for their intemperancie in speech, and also noteth, that they use a short and obscure kind of Language, that they speake many things ambiguously of purpose, that they talke much in praise of themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in disgrace of others, and that they are detracters and selfe-conceited or opinionated. <HI>Strabo</HI> also noteth their boasting, which is that <HI>French</HI> ostentation which <HI>Caesar</HI> speaketh of <HI>lib.</HI> 7. and is exemplified in many of his other Bookes: such is the boasting of <HI>Helvetius Divicon lib.</HI> 1. while he extols and magnifies the vertue of the <HI>Helvetians,</HI> and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> upbraid the <HI>Romans</HI> with the remembrance of their overthrow.

<P>And so much concerning the <HI>French-mens</HI> Religion, now let us adde something concerning their customes and fashions: <HI>Livie</HI> testifies, that the <HI>French-men</HI> doe come to Councell in Armour; <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that it was the manner of the <HI>French</HI> Councels, that if any one did interrupt a Suiter, a publick Officer went to him, and drawing out his sword, did threaten him, and command him to keepe silence: and if hee did not then hold his peace, the Officer did in the same manner as formerly, the second and third time; and lastly he cut off so much of the Interrup∣ters cloake, so that the rest was good for nothing: <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, that the <HI>French-mens</HI> Councels are rash and suddaine, and that they are uncon∣stant in Councell, and desirous of innovation. The same <HI>Caesar</HI> noteth, that the <HI>French-men,</HI> when any matter of note happeneth, are wont by a speedie way, to notifie it unto the Countries round about, and that is by acclamations and shouting with the voyce, for from them the others receive it, and they againe by the same meanes make it knowne to their neighbours. They doe not suffer their Children (saith <HI>Caesar</HI>) when they are growne to ripenesse of yeares, to come unto them openly, be∣cause they should not neglect the service of the warres: and they thinke it an unseemely thing for the Sonne in his Childehood to sit in publick in the sight of his Father. The men doe make their wives a dowrie ac∣cording to the portion which they receive with them, both which are put into one stock, so as that which ariseth from it is kept to their use: and which soever of the parties doth out-live the other, he or shee hath both parts with the use and profit which hath arisen from thence. The <HI>French</HI> women are beautifull, and like men for strength and stature, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> saith; they are fruitfull, and when they bring forth children, they give them good education. Servitude was usuall in <HI>France</HI> accor∣ding to the manner of other Nations. And <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, <HI>lib.</HI> 6. that the most of them when they are oppressed either with debt or by great taxes, or by the power of great men, they betake themselves to the ser∣vice of Noble-men, who have as much power over them, as Masters
<PB N="258" REF="222"/>
have over their Servants: yet they use them with more humanity and curtesie than the <HI>Romans</HI> did. For the <HI>French</HI> Lords had these Servants, or (as <HI>Caesar</HI> calleth them by a <HI>French</HI> word) <HI>Ambacti,</HI> who attended or them to increase their traine, and they us'd them in service of warre. Moreover they commonly used (as <HI>Diodorus</HI> witnesseth) thicke earthen Cups, and wrought with flowres on them. They did all suppe sitting not on seates but on the ground, upon the skins of wolves and dogges spread thereon, the younger youths serving them at meate. And neere unto them there was a fire made, and pots of flesh set thereon, especially with Swines flesh both fresh and salt. But for the most part, as <HI>Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> writeth, their meate was Milke. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> thus delivereth his minde out of <HI>Posidonius</HI> concerning this Nation: <HI>The</HI> French <HI>use to drinke upon a litle hay spread under them, having litle woodden Tables before them. Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (which, as</HI> Plinie <HI>noteth, they make light with leaven) is there a comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> foode.

Concerning the Manners of the Burbons, those which border on <HI>Avernia</HI> are of the same dis∣position with them, namely wittie and craftie, very laborious, care∣full to get, and for the most part they are litigious, and violent men, and ill to be dealt withall. Those that dwell farther off are courte∣ous and affable, subtile and well experienced, frugall and carefull housekeepers, greedy of gaine, and yet very bountifull and kind to∣ward strangers. The Forensians also are subtile, acute, and witty, wisely provident and carefull in their owne affaires, loving gaine, and to that end they travell into remote and farre distant Countries to Merchandise and traffique with them. But they are mercifull and kinde to their owne Countrymen if they come to necessity and want in forraine Countries. Much warinesse and wisedome is to be vs'd, in despatching any businesse with a Forensian. <HI>Forrest</HI> doth send her workes in Iron and Brasse thorow the whole world, especially the Fane of S. <HI>Stephen,</HI> where there are very many Artificers, and as good as any in <HI>France.</HI> And there are many Merchants of this Country ve∣ry rich, having great estates in other parts out of <HI>France.</HI></P>

But when the Frenchmen g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> slothfull and carelesse, the Aquitanians about the yeere 727. shaking off their subjection to the French did create <HI>Eudo</HI> Duke thereof.

Afterward <HI>Hunold</HI> whom

the Aquitanians had made Duke, being vanquished and droven out by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, this Province was restored to the French, and to keepe it the better in obedience, there were Earles placed in divers parts of <HI>Aquitaine,</HI> and especially at <HI>Bourdoaus</HI> there was left <HI>Sigumus</HI> the Father of <HI>Huon</HI> of <HI>Bourdeaus,</HI> and after these other Earles and Dukes did governe the people under the King of <HI>France. D. Marttalis</HI> was the first that converted those of <HI>Bourdeaus</HI> to the Christian faith, who as it is reported built a Temple there, and dedicated it to <HI>S. An∣drew</HI> the Apostle, afterward it became the Seate of an Archbishop, on which these Bishopricks doe depend, <HI>Santonensis, Pictaviensis, Lussonen∣sis, Mallacensis, Petragoricensis, Serlacensit, Condomiensis, Agimensis.</HI> And as this City is large, so it is beautified with divers Churches, for there are two Collegiate Churches, one of which is Metropolitan, 12. Pa∣rish Churches, 8. Frieries, one Nunnery, and a Colledge of Jesuites. There is a faire Church-yard of S. <HI>Severine</HI> without <HI>Iupiters</HI> Gate neere the Amphitheater which is worthy to bee seene, both because it is more ancient then the rest, in which S. <HI>Amandus,</HI> and S. <HI>Severinus</HI> were buried, and divers other Monuments are shewed, and also be∣cause there hollow stones laide on Sepulchers, which are full of wa∣ter or empty, according to the increase or decrease of the Moone. Many Knights are here interr'd who were slaine in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the great by the treachery of <HI>Ganelen.</HI> The University is an Orna∣ment unto it, the Professors whereof doe instruct Youth in all Arts and Sciences. In which both heretofore and of late <HI>Tiberius Victor</HI> and <HI>Minervius</HI> a Rhetorician whom <HI>D. Ieromimus</HI> mentioneth in his Chronicle, and maketh another Quintilian. And <HI>Attius Celphidius,</HI> whom <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> calleth a vehement Orator, were Latine and Greeke Professors. And also <HI>Pomponius Maximus Hirculanus,</HI> and many others, of whom <HI>Ausonius</HI> maketh a Catalogue with severall Eulogies. The most noted in our age were, <HI>Andr. Goveanus, Ioannes Gelida, M. Ant. Muretus, Ioannes, Costanus, Georg. Buchanan, Nicolaus Gra∣chius, Withelmus Guerentaeus,</HI> and of late <HI>Elias Vinetus,</HI> a learned man, and a light to his Country. This University had many priviledges, honors, and liberties granted unto it by the Princes of <HI>Aquitaine,</HI> the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and the Popes of <HI>Rome:</HI> and at last was beautified by the Aquitaine Colledge, from whence many learned men as Lights of <HI>France</HI> have successively come forth.

But afterward the Pro∣vinces of <HI>Armenium,</HI> of <HI>Santome,</HI> of <HI>Ruxelles,</HI> and the greatest part of <HI>Cadurcium</HI> did withdraw themselves and came to the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Tolouse.</HI> But when King <HI>Ludovick</HI> had granted <HI>Aquitania</HI> (which was now circumscribed with new bounds) to his Brother <HI>Charles</HI> to hold of him by Fealty, the Parliament was translated to the Picts, but after <HI>Charles</HI> his decease in the yeere 1472. and all <HI>Aqui∣taine</HI> returning to <HI>Ludovick,</HI> it was brought back againe, and not long

Counsellors. <HI>Francis</HI> the first is the yeere 1519. in the moneth of of May added to them a Decurie of new Counsellors, to judge of criminall matters, which they call <HI>To∣nell.</HI> But when by sedition the Parliament in the yeere 1540. wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> changed againe. King <HI>Henry</HI> the 2. restored the former ample dignity of the Senate to <HI>Burdigala,</HI> and received the Citizens into favour. Here the Prefect of the Province of <HI>Aquitaine</HI> hath his Seate, who is called the Marshall and also the Admirall. There is also in the same City a Colledge of Questors or Auditors of accounts. The govern∣ment of the Common-wealth of <HI>Burdeaux</HI> as it is at this day began is the raigne of <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> who in the yeere 1173. granted that the Citizens should freely decree a Prince of the Senate whom they call the Maior of the City, but at first the Maiors held their of∣fice continually, and did yeerely chuse a Substitute out of the sworne men, whom in his absence was to be Governour of the Colledge of sworne men. <HI>Henry</HI> the 2. did change this custome, so that the Maiors office should not be perpetuall, but for two yeeres. After him the sworne men as they call them should succeede: Who being fifty at the beginning were reduced to 24. and in the yeare 1378. they were contracted to 12. according to the number of the parts of the Citie. But at last they came to be sixe, and those to rule two yeares: so the three were changed every yeare, and they continued in their Mai∣roalty for two whole yeares. To this Colledge of the Maior and the sworne men, there were added 30. chosened Citizens to assist them in counsell &amp; above three hundred more were added, if a matter of con∣sequence were handled. It hath a fruitfull Soile for Wines, which is transported from thence into other parrs of <HI>Europe,</HI> the praise where∣of is celebrated by the ancients, as also <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Columella,</HI> and it hath abundane of all other necessaries. Besides it hath convenient Rivers, the greatest whereof are <HI>Garumna,</HI> and <HI>Dordona.</HI> There are many Townes subject to <HI>Burdeaus,</HI> as these neere to the Sea <HI>Esparus</HI> or <HI>Caput S.

bandes of Spanish Souldiers, in which there were twelve hundred Souldiers: five battering pieces of ordinance, three greater and five lesser culueringes, which they planted against the wall. At the first meeting they had a little skirmish, in which <HI>Monluccius</HI> lost many men, and on the Townes side there were 12. slaine, and many woun∣ded on both sides. The two next dayes following there were in like manner some light skirmishes, in which the besiegers had still the worst. In the meane while <HI>Durassius</HI> going to <HI>Aurelias</HI> with a strong armie, by chance marched that way, and sent to <HI>Monluvius,</HI> to desire him to appointe the day and place to joyne battle in. But then <HI>Monluccius</HI> had no minde to fight, who lookt for a better oportuni∣tie, which hee afterward obtained, and gave the <HI>Durassians</HI> a great o∣verthrowe. But lying there in vaine, the Citie being defended with such strong forces, hee raised his siege, in which hee lost 60. Souldiers, and the Towne thirtie. Then <HI>Durassius</HI> proceeded in his former journey, but when hee departed, the garrison of the Citie was much leaned and diminisht, so that by his comming, the Citie receaved more losse then good. For two foreine Cohorts follow∣ed <HI>Durassius,</HI> so that the Citizens were left destitute of all helpe. But as the favour and aide of men did decrease, so the Citizens courage did increase. For they tooke an oath altogether, that they wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d suffer all extremities in the defence of their Country, rather than o∣pen the gates of their Citie, to their malicious enimies. <HI>Monluccius</HI> being certified by one of the Captaines of the army, called <HI>Fontgravi∣us,</HI> both of their want of munition, and the small number of the be∣sieged, marcheth thither in all hast, and the enimies in the third watch of the night did assault the Walls in three places with Scaling ladders, and Musket shot. In the meane time while the Citizens ranne to defend that part of the Wall, a strong band of Souldiers well armed without making any noise, came to the Fortresse of the Ialo∣bites, thinking so to come upon the watch unawares, because the Citizens were busie in fight elsewhere. But they in the watch Tow∣er having discover'd them before they could approach to the Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, cryed out that they were discover'd, they clapt sealing ladders to the Walls, and made a breach in them with an iron Ramme, which 12. men drove against the Walls, and set up two Colours or Bonnets on the Bulwarke, with the sound of Drum, Trumpets, crying out to their companions that followed, that the Citie was taken, but yet the Townesmen encountred them so bravely, that they were enforced to found a retreate with the losse 200. men, and to leave their Ramme and scaling Ladder, there being but one slaine of the besieged. But seeing that cunning stratagems did not prevaile, they determined to besiege the City the third time. First <HI>Terrida</HI> came and brought 21. Cohorts with him two wall peeces of Ordnance, and 7 Colveri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: which being planted against divers parts of the Wall did batter it shroudly, but all in vaine, seeing that men, women and children ran cheerefully to repaire the breaches, and brought earth and other Materials to mend them, which succeeded so well, that although the enemy had made 500. shot against the walls, yet there were but 5. men

slaine. But when the Besiegers saw that their Ordnance did no good, and the Citizens diligence did frustrate their attempts, they turned their assault into a Siege, and so built Towres and Fortresses round about the City, and placed a Garison in them, that no man might goe out of the City, or come in, and so to cut off all ayde or succour from them, that so either famine or length of the siege might enforce them to yeeld. After this they had many other light skirmishes, in which the besieged had alwaies the better. The siege endeth with conditions of peace, which yet were not declared to the Citizens untill the 15. of Aprill, although they were published at <HI>Orleance</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> the 26. of March. In all the Sieges there were slaine on the besiegers side 2000. men, and 60. of the besieged. But of this enough.

It is the fairest City in <HI>Burgundy.</HI> It is situate on a most plea∣sant Plaine, and the two Rivers <HI>Suzione</HI> and <HI>Oscara</HI> (called in French <HI>Suson</HI> and <HI>l'Ouche</HI>) doe wash the walls on either side: the former doth usually overflow the City making dangerous exundations; the latter is very full of fish, and floweth in a quieter Channell, and yeeldeth many commodities. The walls are built as high as is convenient for defence: being lately fortified with Towers and Bulwarkes. There is a Seate of Justice there, and a Parliament: out of whose bosome, the Lawes of the Country are as it were fetched. Hee that is chose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be Maior of this Towne, is compeld though against his will to take a burden on him rather than an honour, and to take his oath it the Temple of the blessed Virgin, which the Kings Proctor repeateth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣to him, namely that he will be faithfull unto the King, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee will defend the Lawes, Liberties, and Priviledges of the City, against the King himselfe, and all others, as often as occasion shall require. On the Mountaines neere the City there doe grow excellent Vines. Moreover the Episcopall Cityes are <HI>Augustodunum</HI> and <HI>Cabill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> both venerable for antiquity. The former was called <HI>Augustod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> from <HI>Augustus,</HI> (whether <HI>Octavianus</HI> or some other it is not greatly to be stood upon: for those that derive it from <HI>Auge</HI> the wife of <HI>Aph</HI> doe but relate Fables) who re-edified it when it was ruinated by the warres which <HI>Caesar</HI> maintained against <HI>France.</HI> It is now called <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> It was heretofore a very faire City, but now it is not so beautifull Here are many ruines of Theaters, Aqueducts, Pillars, and Pyrami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to be seene: and there are daily old Coynes, and other ancient Mo∣numents digged up, it hath also now many faire Churches and pub∣like Structures in it.

It is very commodious for transporting Merchandise downe the River <HI>Araris,</HI> whence <HI>Caesar</HI> chose this place to make provisionin, and to con∣vey it from hence to his Army which lay in divers parts.

no appearance of a City. But in regard of the conveniency of the place it was afterward reedified, and at this time it is a rich Towne of trading. So much concerning the Metropolis, and the Episcopall Citties: there followes now some Townes of lesser noate which are in this Dukedome. In the midde way be∣tweene <HI>Caballinum</HI> and <HI>Matiscon,</HI> there is a Towne commonly called <HI>Tornus; Spartianus</HI> and <HI>Antoninus</HI> call it <HI>Tinurtium.</HI> It is situate in a fertile soyle, being every where encompas'd with the River <HI>Araris.</HI> The Hills in the Country of <HI>Suburbicaria</HI> doe bring forth excellent Wine.

On the East it hath high Mountaines, and cleare Rivers, whose waters are very sweet to drink, from whence a wholesome Fountaine, springing out of the high sandy Rocke is convey'd into the Towne by woodden Pipes. On the West a Plaine spreadeth forth it selfe. Three leagues from the City <HI>Cabellon</HI> North∣ward is <HI>Belna,</HI> commonly called <HI>Beaulne,</HI> neere the River which the Inhabitants call <HI>Beur-soize.</HI> Some would have it to be that which <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> call <HI>Bibracten.</HI> Others are of another opinion. This Towne is situated in a Fennish place, which as <HI>Paradine</HI> writeth can easily make a Lake about the City, for a mile round about, to keepe of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the enemies. All the City is encompassed with strong walls, and hath Bulwarks, which can resist the force of Ordnance. The Coun∣try of <HI>Belnia</HI> is rich, and of a good soyle. It hath the best Vines in all the world, which make the best Wine. In the same Country is <HI>Cister∣tium</HI> called so from the <HI>Cisternes,</HI> built at Duke <HI>Odoes</HI> charge in a great Wood, under the Priory whereof there are above a thousand and eighty Frieries, and as many Nunneries, of the same Order, which from hence is called the Cistertian Order. <HI>Semurium,</HI> commonly cal∣led in French <HI>Semur,</HI> is situate in the middle of the Territory, which is commonly call'd <HI>Auxois,</HI> a faire Towne.

He dyed there in the yeere 1452. in the moneth of January, having three yeeres before for quiet sake passed over the Papall dignity to <HI>Nicolas,</HI> he being content to be a Cardinall onely. <HI>Elenor</HI> Daughter to the Lord of <HI>Fossignij</HI> married <HI>Peter</HI> the sixt Earle of <HI>Sabaudia.</HI> And also <HI>Mary</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Amedes</HI> the fourth, the 8.

<P>The chiefe Mountaines are the Alpes, which now as it were a wall doe separate <HI>Italy</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany.

So that the River breaking into this Lake with a foaming
<PB N="391" REF="313"/>
entrance, and passing through the still waters thereof, doth runne through the middle of it, as it were a contrarie element unto it, without augmenting or diminishing his owne waters, it commeth forth againe retayning the same name and strength which it had be∣fore. And which is a wonder, the Lake is not moved with the violent course of the water, nor the hasty River is not stayed with the muddy filth of the Lake, as if they could not be mingled together: and if it were not seene to runne through the Lake, it could not be discerned by the forcible course thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rivers.</NOTE> Moreover the Rivers which water <HI>Helvetia,</HI> are <HI>Rhene, Rhodanus, Adua, Ticinus, Limagus, Byrsa, Langarus, Sa∣ra, Taurus</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Dur, Aenus, Arola,</HI> and many others. It were needlesse to reckon the Mountaines, seeing the names of the <HI>Thetian</HI> Mountaines are knowne to all men. But least I should seeme too defective herein, I will mention some of them. The Mountaine of <HI>Gothardus</HI> is now called the high Alpes, after which the <HI>Penine</HI> Alpes doe follow: neere to the Salassians there are the <HI>Cottian</HI> Alpes and the Mountaine <HI>Silvius.</HI> Also the greater and lessers Mountaines of S. <HI>Bernard.</HI> The <HI>Graectan</HI> Alpes belong to the Lepontians: the Moun∣taine <HI>Adulas</HI> which the Germanes call the Mountaine <HI>der Vogel,</HI> tou∣cheth the <HI>Misacians.</HI> The <HI>Iulian</HI> Alpes, and the Mountaine <HI>Permurna</HI> are in the Engadinians Countrie. From hence are the Mountaines <HI>Valerius</HI> and <HI>Brantius,</HI> neere the Vendanians: <HI>Rhetico</HI> is a Mountaine a∣mong the Rhucantians. The Mountaine <HI>Iurassus</HI> hangeth over the Lake <HI>Leman.</HI> The Mountaines call'd <HI>Abnobae</HI> are in the confines of the Tulingians. And these are the most famous Mountaines of this Coun∣trie. But we will speake more largely concerning the Alpes in the description of <HI>Italie.</HI> There are innumerable Woods, which are but parts of the Wood <HI>Hiercynta,</HI> which beginneth here, although they are called by severall names, as the <HI>Brigantine</HI> Wood, the Wood <HI>Ryhn∣walds, Bonwaldt,</HI> and others. The Helvetian Commonwealth is a mixt government of the Nobles and the people. For some of these Peo∣ple, of whom the whole Citie doth consist, doe use a Democraticall government, where all things are managed by the councell of the Commons, as in those Cantons which have no Townes, as the Ura∣nians, the Suitians, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uderwaldians, the Glarovensians, and the Abbatiscellanians: and in the same manner are the Tuginians, al∣though they have a Towne; the other Cantons are govern'd by the Nobles, as all the other Cities of <HI>Helvetia,</HI> as <HI>Tigurum, Berna, Lucerna,</HI> &amp;c. But seeing the people have the chiefe power, and doe chuse the Ma∣gistrates, these Common wealths are mixt, and some parts are more Aristocraticall, and some parts more popular.</P>

But when they saw there was no hope of the Duke of <HI>Austria's</HI> comming, they joyned themselves in confederacy with the Helvetians. The Canton of <HI>Tugium</HI> hath two parts, and foure hun∣dreds in them, out of every hundred, eleaven Senators are chose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to governe the Country.

There are also faire Pastures for Cattell. Those whom <HI>Pto∣lemy</HI> calls Rauricians and <HI>Caesar</HI> Rauracians (as <HI>Scudus</HI> witnesseth) did heretofore inhabit this Country, who as he reporteth taking exam∣ple by the Helvetians, did burne up all their Townes, Villages, and Houses. <HI>Basil</HI> is now the chiefe City of the Country. Some would have it so called from a Basilisk found here, but their opinion is ab∣surd.

And he addeth, it is likely that there was a passage in this place, while <HI>Au∣gusta</HI> was yet standing, because here in regard of the Valley through which the Torrent floweth out of the Lake <HI>Byrsa,</HI> the banke is lower, and thereby more easily to passe, but neere <HI>Augusta</HI> it is more steepe.
<PB N="395" REF="316"/>
But <HI>Munsterus</HI> doth reject this conjecture, by the authority of <HI>Marcel∣linus,</HI> who calleth that City by a Greeke word <HI>Basileian,</HI> that is a King∣dome, as it were <HI>Regnopolis,</HI> or the Royall City. This City is watered with the River <HI>Rhene,</HI> which devides it about the middle of it, where it is united and joyned together againe with a Bridge. The River <HI>Rhene</HI> is very commodious to the City, because it is Navigable, and bringeth up many great Vessels to it. Two hundred yeeres since it was much shaken with Earthquakes, but it was afterward re-edified, and Pope <HI>Pius</HI> in the yeere 1460. did adorne it with an University, which he endowed with all the Priviledges, Statutes, and Immunities which the Universities of <HI>Bononia, Coline, Heidelberg, Erdford, Lipsick,</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> doe enjoy. <HI>Basil</HI> hath these Prefectureships, <HI>Faren-Sperg</HI> Castles; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>infeld</HI> seated on a high Mountaine: the Towne <HI>Wallenburg: Homburg, Munchenstein, Ramstein,</HI> the County of <HI>Toggius,</HI> where I suppose is <HI>Tog∣ryl,</HI> which is subject to the Abbot of S. <HI>Gallus,</HI> when the Citizens of <HI>Teggius</HI> belong to <HI>Suitia</HI> and <HI>Glaronia:</HI> also the County of <HI>Rapperswijl,</HI> which I suppose should be the County of <HI>Straesberg:</HI> and the Barony of <HI>Rilehberg.</HI> The other Townes of <HI>Tuginum</HI> and <HI>Tigurinum</HI> are in the Table of <HI>Argow.</HI> The Townes in the Country of <HI>Abbatium,</HI> which are neither mentioned in <HI>Suevia,</HI> nor in all <HI>Germany,</HI> are these, <HI>Reiche∣no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, Schaffusen, Kreutslinge, Pfeffers,</HI> or as I suppose <HI>Pfefficon.</HI> This Country is watered with many Rivers and little streames, all which the River <HI>Rhene</HI> at last receiveth. Among which are the Rivers <HI>Rhene, Byrsa,</HI> and <HI>Wiesa. Byrsa</HI> floweth out of the Mountaine <HI>Iura</HI> thorow ma∣ny Valleyes even to <HI>Basilea,</HI> carrying downe with it many Boat-loads of Wood. On the other side the River <HI>Wiesa</HI> doth part it from the Black wood, and much Timber for Building is brought downe this River, and afterward it filleth many Cisternes, and serveth many Houses in the lesser <HI>Basil</HI> with water. For it driveth a Mill which saweth Trees into Bards and square Studdes, it grindeth Corne, and Grindstones to sharpen Carpenters tooles, it serveth to draw Iron into thin Plates, and for many other uses, besides it hath excellent fish, especially Trouts. And though it be lesse than the River <HI>Byrsa</HI> over against it, yet it is fuller of Fish than it, &amp; serveth for more uses, although <HI>Byrsa</HI> doth drive many Mills and is very commodious for Paper-men, who have Houses by this River, or rather neere the little Rivulet which parteth from it, and runneth even to the walls of the greater <HI>Basil.</HI> There are also here <HI>Tolderus, Largus,</HI> and other Rivers. But of this enough. It remaineth that wee should adde something concerning the government of the Common-wealth in these Pro∣vinces. All that are admitted to publike Counsell, are chosen equal∣ly out of the severall Cantons, as well out of the Tugurians, as Basili∣ans. But there are two publike Counsels which have chiefest autho∣rity in these Cities. The greater when many meete together in be∣halfe of the Commons, and this for the most part is called when there are some serious waighty affaires, which appertaine to the Common-wealth. The lesse is that which looketh daily to the government of the Common-wealth, and determines matters of controversie be∣tweene the Citizens. The greater Counsell of <HI>Tigurum</HI> doth consist
<PB N="396" REF="317"/>
of 200. men, that of <HI>Basil</HI> of 244. The lesse Counsell of <HI>Tigurum</HI> hath 50. men chosen out of every Tribe, and <HI>Basil</HI> it hath 60. For 12. are elected out of every Tribe to make up the greater Counsell, besides at <HI>Tigurum</HI> there are 18. chosen out of the Nobles. To the lesser Coun∣sell of <HI>Tiguri</HI> the severall Tribes doe send three men, at <HI>Basil</HI> foure men, and to these are added two Counsels in every City, who are the chiefe Heads of the City; and moreover at <HI>Basil</HI> there are so ma∣ny Tribunes, whom they call the Heads of the Counsell in like man∣ner as they doe the Consuls: besides at <HI>Tigurum</HI> there are 6. chosen out of the Nobility to make up the lesser Counsell, when there are but 3. chosen out of the other Tribes, and moreover 6. others are chosen by free Suffrages, out of any Tribe which the Magistrate shall thinke fitt. The lesser Counsell is devided into the old and the new: they call those the old Senate who have borne office halfe a yeere: the other although they are called when the Senate is held, yet they are not alwaies called, and there are some matters which the new Senate doth onely dispatch. The greater Counsell also at <HI>Basil</HI> is de∣vided in the same manner, and of 12. men chosen out of the Tribes, 6. are joyned or added to the new Senate, and so many to the old. The lesser Counsell doth meete for the most part thrice, and sometimes 4. times every weeke. There is one Consull belonging to the Senates, whom in their speech they call <HI>Burgermeister,</HI> that is, the Master of the Citizens, and the greater Counsell doth choose him. The Tribunes are next to the Consuls in power, whom the Tigurinians call <HI>Oberi∣stemeister,</HI> and those of <HI>Basil</HI> call <HI>Zunffrmeister,</HI> there are 3. of them at <HI>Tigurum,</HI> and two onely at <HI>Basil,</HI> who together with the two Consuls are called the foure Heads of the City.

But in this Table the whole Cantons of <HI>Berne</HI> and <HI>Friburg</HI> are contai∣ned. In the former the chiefe Citie is <HI>Berna.</HI> It is not verie ancient, but if you consider the excellent Situation, the manners and civili∣tie, the Lawes and Statutes, and the power and vertue thereof, it is not inferiour unto any Citie. Concerning the building whereof we reade thus. <HI>Berchtaldus</HI> Duke of <HI>Zeringia</HI> the 4. of that name, built in his time 2. <HI>Friburgis,</HI> that is free Castells, namely one in <HI>Brisgoia,</HI> and the other in <HI>Vehtlandia.</HI> And to the end that his subjects might dwell more safely in <HI>Vchtland,</HI> he purposed to build another Citie neere his Castle, which was called <HI>Nideck,</HI> in a Peninsula which was called <HI>Saccus,</HI> which was at that time a Wood of Oakes. And upon a cer∣taine time when the same <HI>Berchtoldus</HI> was Hunting, he said to his fel∣lowes; we will call this Citie, which we purpose to build in this con∣venient place, after the name of that beast which we shall first meete and after take. And so it happened that they tooke a Beare, which the Germaines call <HI>Bern.</HI> And where (as we said) there grew many Oakes in that place, in which the Citie was to be builded, yet all the trees were cut downe to build houses: whence the workemen would commonly say when they cut downe the trees: <HI>Holtz lassdich hauwen gon: die stat muss heissen Bern: i. e Arbores sinite ut secemini libenter: Quo∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Civitas ista vocabitur Bern:</HI> that is, yee Trees suffer your selves to be cut downe willingly; Because this Citie shall be called <HI>Bern.</HI> This Citie is situated as it were in a Peninsula, which the navigable River <HI>Arola</HI> maketh. For on the South side of the Citie, this River flow∣eth in a low place, from the West Eastward, and then winding back againe it runneth Westward, as far a as Cannon can shoote, which is the whole length of the Citie, so that the River is to the Citie as it were a ditch flowing with fresh water, but that on the West for the length of a Crosse-Bow shot, the foundation of the Citie joyneth to the Continent, which <HI>Isthmus</HI> if it were digged through, the Citie <HI>Bern</HI> would be an Iland.

This <HI>Schuldahis</HI> hath great authority and power in these Ci∣ties. Here are also two publike Counsels, the greater and the lesse. The greater Counsell of <HI>Berne</HI> and <HI>Tigurum,</HI> is called the Counsell of two hundred men, although there are more than two hundred in it. But the lesser Counsell of <HI>Berne</HI> consisteth of sixe and twenty men. The manner of chusing the Senate at <HI>Berne</HI> is thus: The foure Stan∣dard-bearer

The soile is fit for tillage and fruitfull; for it hath abundance of Grapes, Wheate, Pease, Rapes, Cauly-flowres, French-beanes, Melons, Leekes, Onions, Lentills: Also Barley, Hay, Oates, and other graines. These fruites are common heere, Nuttes, Apples, Peares, of divers sorts, sweete and sowre cherries, blacke and white Mulberries, Chesnuts, Al∣monds, but Figs are more rare.

But in this Table, the Townes <HI>Lucerna, Vren, Switz, Vnder∣wald,</HI> and <HI>Glarona,</HI> are contained: <HI>Lucerna</HI> is a Citty of <HI>Helvetia</HI> which <HI>Meyerus</HI> calleth <HI>Lacocerna,</HI> it is situated upon the River <HI>Rusa,</HI> where it breaketh out of a great Lake, by which there is a passage by boate to three Townes, unto the foote of the high Mountaine which they commonly call <HI>Fractum &amp; Pilati Montem,</HI> that is, the broken Mountaine or <HI>Pilats</HI> Mountaine. The Lake is very convenient for the Citty, because there is a way by it into <HI>Italy,</HI> by the <HI>Leponius Alpes;</HI> which they call now the Mountaine of Saint <HI>Gothards</HI> from hence commodities are carried to the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and from thence by Packe-horses into <HI>Italy;</HI> and againe, <HI>Italian</HI> commodities are brought downe the Lake, and the River <HI>Rusa</HI> to the <HI>Rhene,</HI> and so unto the Ocean. Besides, the <HI>Lucernatians</HI> doe make more profit by the Lake, than of the adjacent soyle lying about it, although they have excel∣lent Meddowes for the pasturing and feeding of Cattell. It is a very pleasant Citty, and rich, being the common Mart Towne of the <HI>Suitensians,</HI> the <HI>Vranians,</HI> and the <HI>Transiluanians.</HI> The originall of this City is uncertaine: it is reported that there were Castles on both sides of the River, which were built by the <HI>Almaines,</HI> but there are Cittizens houses in their places. It was so called from a Lampe or light which was hung out there, as a Sea marke for the direction of Marriners, and it is credible and likely that the auncient Tower ser∣ved for this purpose, which at the higher bridge is now named from the waters; The like is at <HI>Tigurum,</HI> which is called from the Sea waves <HI>Wellenberga:</HI> the auncients did call these kind of Towers Watch-towers. Their owne Annalls doe report, that the <HI>Lucernatians</HI> did go to warre with <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, against the <HI>Sarazins,</HI> and that hee gave them some priviledges, and taught them the use of Hornes, with which in these times, they doe sound a retreate in the warres.

<P>I Have hitherto faithfully described the Kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> now I come to the Low Countries, being my dearest and Nati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Country. And first to begin with the name. Some would have this part of <HI>Europe,</HI> the which is now called the Lower <HI>Germanie,</HI> to be called <HI>Belgium</HI> by <HI>Caesar,</HI> in which he writeth that he billited three Legions, and <HI>Hircius</HI> foure. But <HI>Martianus</HI> and <HI>Glaro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus</HI> doe take it for a Cittie not for a Country. But <HI>Vegetius</HI> will hardly beleeve that one Cittie can containe five Legions. And <HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe shew∣eth in his fourth booke, that many Citties were comprehended with∣in <HI>Belgium,</HI> where he saith that they did inhabite the Sea cost of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣taine,</HI> who passed over out of <HI>Belgium,</HI> to get some prey and boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, who were all called after the names of those Citties, from where they came.

<HI>Belgium</HI> from the fiercenesse of the Nation, being named <HI>Belgae</HI> as it were <HI>Velgae,</HI> that is, fierce and violent; or else they were called <HI>Belgae</HI> by changing of the second vowell into the first, as it were <HI>Bal∣gas,</HI> from their hotnesse and pronenesse to fight: for <HI>Balgen</HI> signifies to fight. But the Country which we now entreate of, is but the halfe part of <HI>Belgia.</HI> It is called now Lower <HI>Germany; Germany,</HI> be∣cause it differs little in speech, manners, lawes, and customes, from the <HI>Almaines,</HI> and the other <HI>Germaines.</HI> It is called the lower, because it is neerer the Sea than the other part of <HI>Germanie,</HI> and in respect of the higher <HI>Germany,</HI> the fields and grounds doe lye lower. It is com∣monly called the <HI>Netherland,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> call it <HI>Le Pais Bas.</HI> It is cal∣led also almost throughout all <HI>Europe</HI> by the figure Synecdoche, that is, by taking a part of the whole, <HI>Flanders,</HI> either in regard of the power and beauty of that Country above the rest, or for the chiefe and famous Mart Townes, or the ancient Faires kept at <HI>Bruges;</HI> or lastly because it is better knowne, and is neerer to <HI>France, England, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Italie.</HI> And so much concerning the name, the situation and quantitie followeth. The bounds of Lower <HI>Germany</HI> or <HI>Belgians</HI> (for these words I will use promiscuously) are on the North the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣an:</HI> on the South <HI>Lotaring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, Campania,</HI> and <HI>Piccardie:</HI> on the East the Rivers <HI>Rhene</HI> and <HI>Mosa;</HI> on the West the Sea. These Princes are neighbours unto it, the Earle of East <HI>Friseland,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Mun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Trevers,</HI> and the King of <HI>France.</HI> This is the situation: the quality of the soyle followeth, which ariseth from the Climate. Low <HI>Germany</HI> is under the middle of the seaventh and all the eight climate, betweene the degrees of longitude 22 and an halfe, and 30, and betweene the degrees of La∣titude 48, and a halfe, and fiftie three and a halfe. The longest day in Summer towards the middle of the Climate is 16 houres long, and at the beginning of the ninth climate, it is 16, houres long, and three quarters. It containeth all the Parallels, which are betweene 16 and 21, the Aire in the Low Countries is moist, yet wholesome to the in∣habitants. The summers are delightfull, pleasant, and temperatly hot: they have not too much heate, nor no great store of flies and gnatts, nor sildome any thunder, or earth-quakes. The winters are long and windy, and when it is a North or East winde, it occasions sudden frosts: but when the winde is in the South or West, the ayre is more milde, and the cold is turned into raine. The soyle for the most part is sandie and gravelly, as a great part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and al∣most all <HI>Brabant,</HI> it is reasonable fertile in producing corne, and other fruites, and some places are very fertile, as <HI>Zeland, Flanders, Hanna∣nia, Artesia, Gelderland.</HI> And it hath abundance of Corne, Baile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Rye, Hempe, and Cotton. It produceth also all kindes of fruites in great plenty, as Apples, Peares, Prunes, Cherries, Mulberies. Pea∣ches, Apricockes, Filberts, Medlars, and in some places Chesnuts. And heere is abundance of Madder gathered for Dyers, and a great gaine is made of it, by transporting it into other Countries. There are no mettall Mines of any great note: As concerning the trees; they doe yeeld a pleasant prospect, standing thicke and very orderly, and

being loaden with fruite, and besides they serve for fire-wood and timber for building of houses, being very high and wondrous thicke, and there are great store of them here. There are few Bay-trees, and Cypresse trees. There are also great store of Teile trees common∣ly called Linden, which are like to Elmes in shape, and leaves, but they be bigger and doe sooner come forward. For in 16, or 18, yeeres they will be as big as a mans middle. They use them also in building: and they make coales of them which are better to make gunpowder than Willow coales. Betweene the Barke and the wood there is a kinde of downe like Cotton, of which they make roapes and cordage. But many beasts will not eate the leaves thereof though they be new budded forth. As <HI>Virgill</HI> sheweth in this verse:
<Q><LG>

<L>Neither the light teale Tree</L>
<L>Nor Boxe that cannot turned be.</L>

<L>Not the light Tealetree, nor Beech which spreads,</L>
<L>Nor the Oake that never weddes.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>It hath also great plenty of Ew trees which is a poysonous tree, but excellent Bowes are made of them. Of the juyce thereof a poyson is made, with which <HI>Caesar</HI> reporteth that <HI>Cattivalcus</HI> king of the <HI>Ebu∣re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians</HI> did make away himselfe. There is also another kind of tree which is not found any where else, which is like a white Poplar, the inhabitants doe call it in the plurall number <HI>Abeelen.</HI> There is great store of them in <HI>Brabant,</HI> which serve for divers uses, especially at <HI>Bruxels.</HI> The Low Countriemen may prayse the goodnesse of their soyle for bringing up of Cattell. For Oxen, horses, sheepe, and great heards of cattell are bred there. And especially great, strong horses fit for service in the warres. There are also the best Oxen, especially in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Friesland,</HI> where an Oxe often waigheth a thousand and two hundred pound waight. <HI>Ludovicke Guicciardine</HI> an <HI>Italian,</HI> unto whom our Country is much beholding for making an accurate and true description thereof, saith that the Earle of <HI>Mech∣lin</HI> had an Oxe given him which weighed two thousand, five hun∣dred, and eight and twentie pound, which he caused afterward to be painted in his Pallace. The Kine have loose great Vdders, and full of milke. For in some parts of <HI>Holland</HI> in Summer time, they will give foure and forty Pints of milke. I passe by many other things, least should bee tedious. For hunting they have abundance of Does, Harts, Goates, Boares, Badgers, Hares, and Conies, and o∣ther games besides. And for Hawking they have Hernes, Kites, Vultures, Partridges, Phesants, Turtle Doves, Starlings, Thrushes, Storkes, Duckes, Geese, Woodcockes, or Snipes, which <HI>Nemesia∣nus</HI> describeth thus.</P>

And <HI>Caesar Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Commentaries,</HI> concerning the <HI>French</HI> warre, doth call them the valiantest of all the <HI>Gaulls.</HI> For he writeth thus. The valiantest of all the <HI>Gauls</HI> are the Low Countriemen, because they care not for trim∣nesse of attire, and merchants have not frequent recourse unto them, and therefore those commodities are not brought to them which doe effeminate the minde; and they are neere to the <HI>Germaines,</HI> who live beyond the <HI>Rhene,</HI> with whom they wage continuall warre; by which reason also the <HI>Helvetians</HI> doe exceede the other <HI>French-men</HI> for valour, because they have dayly skirmishes and fights with the <HI>Ger∣maines,</HI> when either they drive them forth out of their borders, or they doe make inroades into their Territories. And hence wee may collect their strength and courage in defending their liberties, that in the time of <HI>C. Caesar,</HI> they endeavoured to shake off the <HI>Romaine</HI> yoke of subjection. And so they mustred &amp; joyned armies to contend with them. The <HI>Bellovacians</HI> set forth 6000 souldiers, the <HI>Suessones</HI> 5000, &amp; the <HI>Nervians</HI> (who were then so wilde and uncivill, that they would not suffer Merchants at that time to bring them wine or other com∣modities) did set forth 5000. The <HI>Atrebatians</HI> and <HI>Ambianians</HI> did set forth 10000, the <HI>Morineans</HI> five and twentie thousand. The <HI>Menapians</HI> 60, thousand. The <HI>Caletians</HI> 10 thousand; the <HI>Velocassi∣ans</HI> and <HI>Veromanduans,</HI> did set forth 10 thousand a piece: the <HI>Ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aticians</HI> 18, thousand: the <HI>Condrusians, Eburonians,</HI> and <HI>Caemani∣ans,</HI>
<PB N="428" REF="332"/>
40 thousand. So that the whole summe of choyse Souldiers was 273 thousand, as <HI>Orosius</HI> witnesseth: or as <HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe delivers, their number was 368 thousand, whereby it appeareth that the Low Countrie men were alwayes noble Souldiers. And <HI>Caesar</HI> in the se∣cond of his Commentaries saith, that it was they alone who in our fathers time did vexe all <HI>France,</HI> and did keepe out the <HI>Tentomanes</HI> and <HI>Cimbrians,</HI> out of their <HI>Territories;</HI> whereby it came to passe, that the memorie of their atchiuements, did make them valiant and full of courage in Militarie affaires. And forreine armies have found it in our age, who being fresh souldiers and joyning battell with the old soul∣diers, they found that the Citizens, Countrymen, and Sea-men, were al stout of courage. There are 17 Provinces in the low Countries, all of which the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth did possesse: in which there are 4 Dukedomes, the Dukedome of <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Limburg,</HI> which together with the Countie of <HI>Dale</HI> and the Lordships of <HI>Valckenburg,</HI> and <HI>Rode le Due,</HI> is joyned to <HI>Brabant,</HI> and it dependeth on the Chan∣cerie of <HI>Brabant:</HI> also the Dukedomes of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> and <HI>Gelderland.</HI> There are 7 Counties, <HI>Flanders, Artesia, Hannonia, Holland, Zeland, Namurcium</HI> and <HI>Zutphania:</HI> also the Marquiship of the holy empire, which hath foure principall Citties, <HI>Nivella, Lovanium, Braxells,</HI> and the <HI>Metropolis Antwerpe;</HI> it is now a part of <HI>Brabant.</HI> There are five Lordships, or Signiories, of <HI>West-Friesland,</HI> of <HI>Mechlin,</HI> of <HI>Vltrajectum,</HI> of <HI>Trans-Isaliana,</HI> and <HI>Groneland.</HI> There are many Citties, in the Low Countries, which are well fortified, the number whereof as also of the Townes and villages you may finde in <HI>Mercator.</HI> But the chiefe Citties are <HI>Lovaine, Bruxells, Antwerpe, Silva Ducis, Gandavum, Bruges, Hipra, Mechlinia, Cameracum, A∣trebatum, Tornacum, Valencena, Insulae, Dort, Harlem, Amsterdam, Lugdunum Battavorum, Namurcum, Neomagum, Trajectum</HI> and o∣thers. There is a great company of Lakes, Pooles, and Marshies, in the Low Countries, which doe not onely hold great store of fish, but doe also fortifie those Countries, against the invasion of enemies. Few Rivers doe rise in this Country, but many Rivers, which have their spring head farther off, doe glide through it, and doe much enrich it. The chiefest are <HI>Rhene, Mosa, Scaldis, Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis:</HI> the lesser are <HI>Mosella, Lisa, Aa, Sambra, Dela,</HI> and many others. Wee will speake of <HI>Rhene</HI> and <HI>Amasis</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and wee have spoken of <HI>Mosella</HI> in <HI>Germanie,</HI> now we will describe the rest. <HI>Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> doth flow out of the Mountaine <HI>Vogesus,</HI> which is situate on the borders of the <HI>Lingonians,</HI> not farre from the Fountaines of <HI>Araris</HI> and <HI>Matrona,</HI> and so running Northward it glideth by the Church of Saint <HI>Theobald,</HI> or Saint <HI>Tibaut,</HI> where it beginnes to be navigable: from thence it slideth to <HI>Virdunum,</HI> and from thence bending to∣wards <HI>Caecia,</HI> it runnes straite forward to <HI>Mosa</HI> and <HI>Maser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acum.</HI> From thence turning Northward, it visiteth <HI>Carolomont, Boviniacum, Dinantum,</HI> and <HI>Namurcum;</HI> and there growing wider by the receipt of the River <HI>Sabis,</HI> it turneth it selfe Westward, and so having view∣ed <HI>Hoium,</HI> and <HI>Leodium,</HI> and glided by <HI>Trajectum,</HI> and <HI>Stochemum,</HI> it passeth by <HI>Ruremunda</HI> and <HI>Venloium:</HI> where turning West-ward it
<PB N="429" REF="332"/>
watreth <HI>Cuicka, Ravestienum</HI> and <HI>Megena:</HI> afterward being received into the <HI>Rhene,</HI> neere the Towne of <HI>Herwerd,</HI> and so afterward min∣gleth it selfe with <HI>Vahalus,</HI> and straite way they part againe, yet still keeping their owne names: and so they fall in two divided streames, into the River <HI>Lovesteinum:</HI> where they doe encircle the <HI>Bomelian</HI> Island, and so joyne together againe, and losing their ancient name they are called by the name of <HI>Merova:</HI> and so gliding by <HI>Worcomi∣um</HI> and <HI>Gorcomium,</HI> they come at last unto <HI>Dort,</HI> and there making the Island of <HI>Iselmond,</HI> it is called <HI>Mosa,</HI> and so retayning still the same name, having glided by <HI>Roterdame</HI> and <HI>Vlaerdinga,</HI> it entereth into the Sea, about the Brill with such a violent current, that for a long way together it preserveth his water fresh and sweete. And Stur∣gions delighting in this sweete fresh water are allured to come up the River, and so are easily taken; which doth not happen to other Ri∣vers, because they entring the Sea with a quiet gentle streame, thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> water presently becomes salt, as <HI>Seyne, Iberus Thames,</HI> and many o∣ther great Rivers. On the contrary, <HI>Eridanus, Tiber, Rhodanus, Ga∣rumna,</HI> and other Rivers which runne into the Sea with greater vio∣lence, doe in like manner as <HI>Mosa</HI> allure and entice the Sturgeons to come up into them, but not in so great Plentie. Besides, the Stur∣gions which are taken in the Rivers <HI>Mosa</HI> and <HI>Rhene,</HI> are greater and more pleasant in taste than those in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea. They are of a silver shining colour, of a great bignesse. There are some ta∣ken which do waigh above 400 pound. <HI>Guicciardine</HI> doth report, that be saw in the Market at <HI>Antwerp</HI> a Sturgeon of 420 pound waight, &amp; that it was above 12 feete of <HI>Antwerp</HI> long: and on another day in the morning he saw 70. Sturgeons together, the least of which was above five foote long. This fish is first seene in <HI>Holland, Zeland,</HI> and <HI>Fries∣land,</HI> in the Moneth of <HI>Aprill,</HI> and it is found three moneths together or longer, during which time great store of them are taken. And from hence transported into other Countries, especially into <HI>England,</HI> be∣ing salted up, and so kept from putrifying; &amp; also at other times, all the yeere through, they take lesser sturgeon, which are delicate in taste. Out of this, being enticed by the freshwater, they come up into the mouth of the River <HI>Mosa,</HI> in which there are very fatte Salmones, Trouts, which are taken here all the yeere long, also <HI>Lampreys, Mul∣letts, Congers,</HI> and other kinds of excellent fish, which here for brevi∣tie sake I omit. But this is wonderfull, that those fish are bad if they betaken in the Sea, but very good and fat, when they enter into fresh water. Besides, this River doth naturally breed besides other fish, Trouts, Lampries, some greater &amp; some les, but more delicate in taste. <HI>Schaldis</HI> which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> calls <HI>Thahuda,</HI> the Low countriemen <HI>Schelt,</HI> the <HI>French Escault,</HI> doth rise in <HI>Veromanduum;</HI> neere Saint <HI>Martines Abby,</HI> as they call it, where it gently slideth betweene <HI>Castellet,</HI> and <HI>Beau-revior,</HI> two <HI>French</HI> Fortifications, &amp; so runneth to <HI>Cameracum:</HI> thence going toward the Country of <HI>Hannonia,</HI> it watreth the noble Citty of <HI>Valence:</HI> and afterward growing navigable, having received the River <HI>Hania,</HI> it glideth by the <HI>Condatum;</HI> and afterward being enlarged by the receipt of the River <HI>Scarpa,</HI> it vieweth S. <HI>Amandum,</HI>
<PB N="430" REF="333"/>
and so bending Northward toward <HI>Tornacum,</HI> it glideth by <HI>Aldenar∣da,</HI> and the famous Cittie <HI>Gandauum,</HI> where it receiveth the Rivers <HI>Lisa,</HI> and <HI>Livia,</HI> and other streames. From thence with many win∣dings and Maeander-like turnings it runneth forward to <HI>Teneremunds:</HI> and there having received the River <HI>Tenera,</HI> flowing on the right hand, it goeth toward <HI>Rupelmunda:</HI> and there it receiveth <HI>Rupels,</HI> and a little after <HI>Dela:</HI> and being now growne bigger, it by and by washeth the walls of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and maketh a faire Haven or Har∣bour for shippes before the Towne: afterward having runne a little further, it parteth it selfe into two channells, and so divideth <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> from <HI>Zeland:</HI> for on the left hand, it windeth and ben∣deth Southward, and so runneth by the shores and borders of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> and is called by another name <HI>de Hont,</HI> from the barking noyse thereof; from whence it passeth by <HI>Zuytbeveland</HI> and <HI>Walachria</HI> into the Westerne Ocean: on the right hand leaving <HI>Brabant,</HI> it keepeth one continuall course in his old channell, by the Island of <HI>Scaldis,</HI> and so with a violent current runnes into the Sea. Moreover the tyde fol∣loweth up into this River, even to <HI>Gandauum,</HI> which is thirty miles from the mouth of it, if you count them by the winding course of the bankes. There doe come up into this River Sturgeons, Sal∣mones, Troutes, great Lampreys, Turbotts, Congers, Cuckow fishes Mullets, Crabs, Lobsters, Sardins, and many most delicate fish, which come up out of the Sea into <HI>Scaldis,</HI> and doe there feede, and cast their spawne; so that for two or three monethes, betweene the Spring and the Summer, besides the greater fish, there is taken so great a number of small Frie, that many men doe live by them. Also many Sea Dogfishes, and Porpoises doe come up this River, which two kind of fishes doe not cast forth any spawne, but doe bring forth their young ones perfectly formed. The Dogfishes doe bring forth their young on the Land, and doe suckle them with their dugges, untill they are growne to a good bignesse. Moreover, this River without the helpe of the Sea, doth yeeld divers kindes of fish all the yeere long, of which these are the chiefe: Pikes, Barbells, Tenches, Carpes and Breames of an unusuall bignesse, so that they doe some∣times, weigh 20 pound; also Gudgeons, and many other kindes of fish both great and small. Also divers kindes of Eeles, and Crabbes, and in the mouth of the River, there are some Oysters, which come thither out of the Sea. And therefore this River for multitude of fish and variety, is not inferiour not onely to any River of <HI>France,</HI> but also of all <HI>Europe. Aa</HI> riseth neere <HI>Teroana,</HI> and so bending towards <HI>Caesia,</HI> it slideth by the Church of Saint <HI>Audomare,</HI> and so comming to <HI>Griveling</HI> (neere which in the yeere 1558 that famous battell was fought betweene the <HI>Burgundians</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>) it doth dis∣charge it selfe into the <HI>Brittish</HI> Sea. <HI>Lisa</HI> commonly called <HI>de Leye,</HI> riseth in <HI>Artesia,</HI> in the Towne <HI>Lisburg,</HI> which taketh his name from this River, neere <HI>Teroana:</HI> and having viewed <HI>Aria, Armenteris, Wervicum,</HI> and <HI>Meenen,</HI> and from thence cutting through the middle of <HI>Cortracum</HI> and <HI>Gandauum,</HI> it mingleth it selfe with <HI>Scaldis:</HI> it hath abundance of very good fish. <HI>Sambra</HI> commonly called <HI>Sambre,</HI>

which <HI>Caesar</HI> calleth <HI>Sabris,</HI> doth rise in <HI>Hannonia,</HI> neere the Towne <HI>Novion;</HI> and so having view'd the Townes, which are commonly called <HI>Landrecy, Sassene, Barlaymont, Mabeuge, Merne,</HI> and <HI>Cassele:</HI> at last it glideth by <HI>Namarcum,</HI> and so discharges it selfe into <HI>Mosa,</HI> and is full of delicate fish. <HI>Dela</HI> riseth in <HI>Brabant,</HI> neere the Village Towne <HI>Tila,</HI> and so bending Northward it runneth to <HI>Waveta;</HI> and afterward it floweth by <HI>Louanium</HI> which is three miles distant from thence, and so keeping on his course for three miles, and afterward bending Westward, it embraceth <HI>Mechlinia</HI> with many spreading armes, and afterward foure miles from <HI>Rupelimunda,</HI> being now growne very bigge it falleth into <HI>Scaldis.</HI> The River <HI>La Seine,</HI> as it seemeth, was so named from the <HI>Senones</HI> a people of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> when they came into these Countries to vexe and disturb the <HI>French.</HI> It ri∣seth neere the Towne <HI>Soigni</HI> in <HI>Hannonia,</HI> and so runneth to <HI>Halla,</HI> and having glided by <HI>Bruxells,</HI> it floweth by <HI>Viluorda:</HI> and after∣ward bending toward <HI>Caecia,</HI> it leaveth <HI>Mechlin</HI> on the right hand, and having gone a little further it powreth it selfe into the River <HI>De∣la, Diza</HI> riseth neere the little Towne called <HI>Per:</HI> and so turning Northward it watereth <HI>Eindovia,</HI> and so keeping his former course it commeth to <HI>Silva Ducis,</HI> beneath which it powreth it selfe into <HI>Mosa. Demera</HI> doth flow forth neere the <HI>Tungrians,</HI> in the Dioecese of the <HI>Leodiensians,</HI> and so running West-ward it watereth <HI>Bilsenum, Hasselt,</HI> and <HI>Diest,</HI> and from thence gliding by <HI>Sichenum</HI> and <HI>Arscho∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> it powreth it selfe into <HI>Dela. Netha</HI> riseth neere the Towne <HI>Rhetum,</HI> and floweth by the Towne <HI>Herentalls,</HI> and from thence kee∣ping a direct course, it runneth to the <HI>Signiorie</HI> of <HI>Grobendoncke,</HI> and having received the little River <HI>Aade,</HI> it passeth by <HI>Lira,</HI> and so wa∣treth <HI>Dusten</HI> and <HI>Walem,</HI> and a little further it mingleth it selfe with <HI>Dela. Rucur,</HI> or <HI>Rhoer,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> calleth <HI>Adrana,</HI> as <HI>Ritheime∣rus</HI> writeth, doth rise neere the Towne <HI>Bullinge,</HI> and cutting through <HI>Caesia</HI> it glideth by <HI>Dura</HI> and <HI>Iuliacum,</HI> and at length neere <HI>Ruremun∣da</HI> which it nameth, it falleth into <HI>Mosa.</HI> There are also other lesser Rivers, which for brevitie sake I forbeare to describe. And I passe over also the Torrents, and greater Rivers, least I should be tedious to the Reader; which doe not onely yeeld great store of fish, but are also an ornament and fortification to the Country, and are very convenient for the passing of commodities to and fro. And the Coun∣try people by the helpe of these Rivers making Sluces and Dams to stay the water, doe afterward digge channells for some miles toge∣ther, and after letting the water into them doe make them navigable: so that there is no Cittie which hath not great Barkes, which come up unto it. But this Countrie hath but few fountaines, or Springs of wa∣ter, except in the Mountainous places. And thus having shewed the Rivers that are in the Low Countries, it remaineth that wee should speake somewhat concerning the Ocean: seeing in regard it is so neere unto it, it may be counted not only a member of this Province, but the chiefe head thereof. I say therefore that the Ocean is wide and large, and in rough weather, it is fearefull and terribly furious: for sometimes when tempests happen, the waves goe so high, that
<PB N="432" REF="334"/>
it doth overflow and drowne whole Countries: and especially it breaketh oftentimes in about the coast of <HI>Zeland:</HI> but the inhabitants doe cast up trenches and bankes, which do prevent the danger which might ensue thereby: unlesse when a westerne winde doth contend and blow against the spring tide. The windes which doe most trou∣ble the sea, and thereby doe endanger the Countrie, are the North∣west, the West and the South windes. Also it is much troubled at the New-Moone or Full-moone, and the two Aequinoctialls, at which time (as <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> witnesseth) the Sea doth swell very much. For every new Moone, and full Moone, wee see that there are still the greatest tides and greatest tempests. These tides doe produce some good, and some evill effects. As for the former, it pur∣geth the water (as common experience doth teach us) and will not suffer it to corrupt: and also it maketh ships say le more speedily. For as <HI>Vegesius</HI> saith, <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. concerning Military matters, <HI>Cap.</HI> 42. <HI>Hae∣reciprocantis meatus ambiguitas cursum Navium secunda adjuvat, re∣tardat adversa:</HI> that is, Those tides if they be with a ship, doe hasten her course; but being against her doe foreslow and stay her course. The other evill effects, are the inundations, and violent irruptions of the Sea: For the Ocean doth sometimes come up into the land with such violence, that it driveth backe great Rivers, and doth overflow spacious fields, as we sayd before. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> doth write as much, and the miserable experience of many ages doth consume it. But so much concerning these things. And now having spoken of the Detriment and losse, which some Countries of this Province doe receive by the Ocean, when it is rough and troubled, we must speake somewhat of the commodities, which the whole Province doth reape by it, when it is quiet and peaceable, which commodities are so many and so great, that if they should want them, the Country could not sustaine the halfe part of the inhabitants. And hence it comes to passe, that this Province is as it were the Haven and Mart of all <HI>Europe,</HI> so that there is an infinite multitude of Merchants and Factors, and as it were a confused <HI>Chaos</HI> of inhabitants and forrei∣ners. Besides, the Ocean bringeth many commodities to this Coun∣try, as Herring fishing, and other fishings, which serve not onely to satisfie the voluptuous desires of the rich, but also to sustaine the poore: and the inhabitants doe not onely get their foode, but all their wealth by it. For the over-plus of that which they take, doth furnish a great part of <HI>France, Spaine, Germany, England,</HI> and other Coun∣tries: yea great store of barreld salt-fish is sent even into <HI>Italy,</HI> espe∣cially Salmones and Herrings. Now there are three kinds of fish which they salt, namely Herrings, Codfish, and Salmones. But first we will speake of their Herring fishing of which they make a great commodity. Herrings are found in no River, nor in the <HI>Mediterrane∣an</HI> Sea, nor the <HI>Spanish</HI> nor any other Sea, but onely in this Northerne Ocean: their bignesse, forme, and goodnesse is sufficiently knowne. And when they goe out of the Northerne Sea, which is alwayes in the Spring time, as if they fleeted from their owne native quarters, and went to seeke shady places, they come in such great shoales, that
<PB N="433" REF="334"/>
no Nets can hold them, but that they breake through them, and do even darken the face of the Sea. And many broade bottom'd vessells, which they call <HI>Busses,</HI> are set out from <HI>Holland, Friesland, France, Brittaine,</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> and doe all to avoyd contention, fish in seve∣rall parts, and quarters, either about <HI>England,</HI> or the Coasts of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and the <HI>Orcades.</HI> These fishes are unbowelled alive if it may be (for assoone as they are out of the Sea waters they are dead) by one who hath good wages for doing it; and then another salts them, and so they are presently barrelled up, and afterward sold; afterward the Herring men and Coupers doe salt them anew, and take out the Pilchers which have no Milts nor Rowes, they are barrell'd up a∣gaine with new pickle: afterward they are surveyed by men sworne for that purpose, and so sealed up, in like manner as <HI>Diana's</HI> Priest did seale up red Vermilion, as <HI>Galen</HI> witnesseth. And these are the first kind of Herrings which with <HI>Plautus</HI> we may call salt or pickled Herrings: the other sort are those which are lightly salted; and so dryed in the smoake, being as yellow as gold, whence they call them <HI>Soretum,</HI> because they call a red colour in their language <HI>Sorus.</HI> This Herrng fishing is very commodious and advantagious to the Com∣monwealth of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> seeing not onely one Citty, but many Citties doe wholy depend and live on it, and the Citty and Country get their food by it, pay their debts, maintaine families, and doe get wealth by it. There is another speciall kind of fish which they use to salt, called in Latine <HI>Ascllus Major,</HI> or Cod-fish, thereby to difference it from that which is commonly ealled <HI>Caballian.</HI> It is a great fish, so that some of them are threescore pound weight. It is taken at many times of the yeare, but especially in Lent time, and chiefely in the <HI>Friesland</HI> Sea, and great store of it is usually salted up, whereby the whole country reapeth yeerely great profit. The third kind of salt fish is Salmon: being very good when it is fresh as well as salted. <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> have store of this kind of fish, in all moneths, but most plentie in <HI>Aprill, May,</HI> and <HI>Iune:</HI> of which there is such great store salted up, that the gaine which is made of them amounteth to 200000 crownes. But of these things enough, let us proceede to the rest. The Low Countries are plaine and levell: there are few Hills in it, and fewer Mountaines, unlesse it be in <HI>Lutzen∣burg, Namurcum,</HI> and some parts of <HI>Hannonia,</HI> where they are very thicke, and there are many also in <HI>Leodium.</HI> It is every where beau∣tified with Forrests and Woods, which both grace the Countrie, and afford much pleasure in hunting. The Forrest of <HI>Arden,</HI> in <HI>Iulius Caesars</HI> time, as he himselfe writeth, was the greatest of all <HI>France,</HI> running betweene the <HI>Treverians,</HI> from the River <HI>Rhene</HI> to the <HI>Ner∣vians,</HI> and the <HI>Rhenicans,</HI> being above fifty miles long. And now at this time no wood in all <HI>France</HI> can be compared with it: but now there is a great part of it converted into arrable ground, so that it is farre lesser than it was: and that part which remaineth hath many glades made in it, which the husband men doe till, and call it by an∣other name, but the greatest part of it is from <HI>Theonis Villa</HI> even to <HI>Leodium,</HI> which is thirty miles in length. In the middle of it is
<PB N="434" REF="335"/>
the Citty of S. <HI>Hubert,</HI> which as <HI>Gemma Frisius</HI> witnesseth, lyeth under 26 degrees of Longitude and forty minutes: and 50 degrees of Latitude, and 4. minutes. This Wood hath all kindes of pleasant trees, which are very high, and broad-spreading, which afford both pleasure and profit. <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth it <HI>Arduenna,</HI> the Inhabitants <HI>Arddenna; Rhenanus, Luitticherwald,</HI> which signifies the <HI>Leodiensian</HI> Wood. <HI>Mormavia,</HI> or <HI>Mormau,</HI> is a faire wood in <HI>Hannonia,</HI> which beginneth neere to <HI>Quesnoy,</HI> and so runneth out Southward toward the <HI>Veromanduans:</HI> and hath many Townes in it, and Villages, and many cleare springs and pleasant Fountaines. Here is great store of Charecoale made: whence some supposed that it is a Part of the wood <HI>Carbonaria,</HI> but some affirme that the wood <HI>Carbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na</HI> did lye more Eastward betweene the Rivers <HI>Mosa,</HI> and <HI>Sabis;</HI> and that the pleasant wood <HI>Archta</HI> is a part of it, in which there is a Towne of the same name, fortified with a strong Castell, and there the Lords of <HI>Berlaymont,</HI> were wont to reside: There is also in <HI>Hannont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the plea∣sant wood of Saint <HI>Amand,</HI> which is also called the <HI>Ramensian</HI> wood, because it is neere unto it. It beginneth on the edge of <HI>Flanders</HI> neere the towne of Saint <HI>Amand,</HI> whence it receiveth his name, and so runneth forth Eastward toward the <HI>Valesians,</HI> with a great breadth.

It seemeth that it was so cal∣led from the <HI>Fawnes</HI> and <HI>Satires,</HI> whom perhaps the Poets did there∣fore faine to have hornes, and Goates feete, because the first inhabi∣tants of this Wood were so rude and savage, that they were like beasts.

Also <HI>Grootenheat</HI> is a Wood in <HI>Brabant,</HI> which standeth not farre from <HI>Turneholt,</HI> in which the River <HI>Ada</HI> riseth, which doth afterward discharge itself into the River <HI>Natha.</HI> It is a great Wood, in which Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> to whom <HI>Turnholt</HI> did belong, was wont to hunt much.

Also <HI>Non∣nen</HI> is situate in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and extending it selfe Northward in a great
<PB N="435" REF="335"/>
breadth, it doth containe many Villages &amp; some Abbies. <HI>Poodsbergia</HI> is a great wood, between <HI>Flanders</HI> &amp; <HI>Hannonia,</HI> not far from <HI>Gerardi∣montium</HI> and <HI>Lessina,</HI> and is pleasant in regard of the roundnes of it. <HI>Gulielmi Silva,</HI> or <HI>Williams</HI> Wood is situate in <HI>Artesia,</HI> nere <HI>Rentiacum</HI> where the Emperour joyned battell with the King of <HI>France,</HI> in the yere 1554. <HI>Engelerwallia,</HI> is a pleasant wood in <HI>Gelderland</HI> nere <HI>Arnhe∣mum.</HI> The 7 woods, are 7 great woods, which are nere unto the <HI>Tran∣silanians,</HI> from whence one part of <HI>Fiesland</HI> is denominated, which is now called <HI>Sevenwolden,</HI> that is to say, 7 Woods: every one of them is very spacious &amp; hath many faire towns in them. But so much concer∣ning the woods. I come now to the publick works. There are in these Countries innumerable magnificent Temples, and Churches, many Abbies, infinite numbers of Monasteries, &amp; Friaries, many Hospitalls for strangers, for the sick, for the poore &amp; for Orphans. Truly in <HI>Ant∣werp</HI> only there are 42 such like buildings: the chiefe of which is the Cathedral Church of S. <HI>Mary,</HI> which is very spacious, having a Tow∣er Steeple, which is 400 &amp; 20 foote high, being built of white Mar∣ble, from the top whereof you may view the Cittie, the River cove∣red with ships, and the Countrie round about which is full of Townes and Citties. What should I describe the other Temples, Monaste∣ries, and such like places, of which there are great store both heere and in other Citties and Townes? What should I reckon up the sumptuous Pallaces belonging to Dukes, Earles, and Noblemen? Or what should I mention the other publicke or private buildings? for if I should endeavour to reckon them up, I should sooner want time than matter; wherefore it is better to be silent, than to speake too spa∣ringly. The politick state of these Countries both in generall and spe∣ciall is threefold: the first is the Ecclesiastick state, in which the Ab∣bots are the chiefe, the second is of the Nobility, as the Duks, Earles, Marcgraves, Princes, Barrons, and great Lords. The third is of the Citties, which the chiefe Citties of every Country doe represent. These states the Prince calleth together, when they are to consult concerning matters appertaining to the Prince, or to the Principality, or to the preservation or utility of the Countrie. The Ecclesiasticke state is thus; there are foure Bishops in the Low Countries, the <HI>Camaracensian,</HI> the <HI>Tornaycensian,</HI> and the <HI>Atrebate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sian:</HI> these three are under the Arch-bishop of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> and the <HI>Vltrajectine</HI> who is under the Arch-bishop of <HI>Colen.</HI> I proceed to the Vniversities, which are 4, the Vniversitie of <HI>Lovaine,</HI> and <HI>Doway,</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI> and <HI>Flankford. Lovaine</HI> is famous for the many Colledges, Students, and learned men; the chiefe Colledges are <HI>Lilium, Castrense,</HI> the Col∣ledge of <HI>Porus</HI> and <HI>Falcon,</HI> in which Philosophie is read. The <HI>Bus∣lidian</HI> Colledge hath three languages taught in it, namely, Greeke, Latine, and Hebrew. This Vniversitie, at the request of the No∣bles of <HI>Brabant,</HI> was first instituted and adorned with Priviledges by <HI>Iohn</HI> the 4, Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> in the yeare 1426. <HI>Martinus</HI> the fifth being Pope. The other were erected in our memory. Out of which as it were out of the <HI>Troian</HI> horse innumerable learned men have proceeded, and doe dayly come from thence. For in the Low
<PB N="436" REF="336"/>
Countries there are learned men, skilfull in all faculties and sciences: and as heretofore, so now it produceth famous Schollers; whom it would be too tedious to reckon up. Here are divers Libraries in sun∣dry places, which are replenished with excellent rare Bookes. A∣mong which that at <HI>Leyden</HI> is the chiefe. The inhabitants are faire, quiet, not cholericke, nor ambitious, nor proud: not much given to venerie; civill, plaine, curteous, affable, ingenious and ready, witty, and sometimes talkative: laborious, industrious, faithfull, gratefull towards those that have done them a curtesie, capable of all Arts and Sciences, stout in defending their liberties, and Priviledges even to death. And this may truely be spoken in the generall prayse of them, that the Low Country men are frugall house keepers and thrifty hus∣bands: who following the example of the Ant, do lay up before win∣ter, that which cannot then be gotten; and doe buy fish and flesh, which they either pickle up, or doe dry it in the smoake. For every house, according to the number of their familie, doth kill in Autumne an whole Oxe, or provideth halfe an one, beside a Hogge, which they salt up, and then it will serve them to spend a good part of the yeare, untill the Spring returne againe. Yet many of them are very co∣vetous, and desirous of wealth. The Women are beautifull, well be∣hav'd and curteous. For according to their Country fashion, they are used from their childhood to converse familiarly with every one: and therefore they are very ready both in action or speech or any mat∣ter: neither doth this freedome or liberty make them lesse honest. Neither doe they onely walke alone through the Cittie, but they will goe for fellowship to the next Townes, without any the least suspition of dishonestie. They are very continent, and apt and ready in their affaires And they are not onely carefull of houshold matters, of which their husbands take no care, but they also use Merchandise, and dispatch and conferre of businesses belonging unto men: and that with so great dexterity and diligence, that in many of the Pro∣vinces, as in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> the men do commit all their affaires unto them. And by this manner of living, joyned with the innate desire which women have to rule, they become for the most part too Imperious and proud. It is the fashion both among Princes, and men of inferior ranke, as also among other Nations, on this side the <HI>Alpes,</HI> to give the first born their Parents names, althogh they be yet living. And the Noble of what quality and condition soever they are, doe more esteeme of their eldest daughter, than the rest of the younger, although they have all an equall dowry: so that they marry the rest to those unto whom they denyed her in marriage, reserving her for a better husband. And they are to be praysed, because they easily contract marriages with forrainers, if occasion so require, and are not bound to match them in their owne Country, which is a matter ve∣ry profitable and commodious: for these alliances by marriage are very advantagious to themselves and the Commonwealth. More∣over it is accounted undecent and absur'd, for young men to marry old women, or on the contrary for old men to marry young maydes: as also for a noble personage to marry an ignoble person, or a master
<PB N="437" REF="336"/>
to marry his Maide, and a Mistresse her servant. But the Low Coun∣try men are chiefely given to Mechanicke Arts, but not of the base and servile sort, but the more nobler, as weaving, clothing, and ma∣king of hangings, &amp; tapestry, which serve not only for the use of their owne country: but are also transported into <HI>France, Spaine, Germany,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and also into <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affricke.</HI> For Pi∣ctures, there is no Nation that doth excell it, nor none doth excell in Musicke, or for variety of Languages. <HI>Iohn Eickius</HI> a Low country∣man, did first shew the way how to mingle colours with oyle. And every one in <HI>Flanders, Brabant,</HI> or <HI>Zeland,</HI> can speake not onely their owne Country speech which is Low-Dutch, but also <HI>French.</HI> The Sea men, Merchants, and Schollers, can speake also <HI>Italian, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Greeke</HI> for the most part: and some can understand <HI>Hebrew,</HI> the <HI>Chaldean,</HI> and <HI>Arabicke</HI> language. The Lowcountrie men are also skilfull Seamen. I come to their food, the Lowcountry men doe use Wheate, Rye, Oates, and Barly: they esteeme of no pulse but Beanes, and Pease: they have few Vetches and no Millet at all. For the great strong windes doe lay it, and spoyle it. The Com∣mon people maintaine their families soberly and frugally. Their drinke is for the most part Beere, which is made of Malt, into which they afterward put some ground Barly, and Hops. And this is a very good and wholesome drinke for those that are used to it; they doe also drinke much milke. The rich have wine. They eate commonly Rye bread. They are wont also upon Festivall dayes, especially those which beare their owne name, to make great feasts, and to invite their Parents, Kinsemen, and friends unto them, and to banquet sumptuously with them, and to shew themselves generous and magnificent. They keepe their houses very neate and cleane, being furnished with all kinds of necessary houshold stuffe. And truly it is a faire sight to see what store of housholdstuffe they have, and how well ordered it is, and how cleane it is kept; in which, with∣out doubt it doth excell all the Nations of the World. But the Low Countriemen are too much given to the Vice of drinking, in which they take great delight, so that oftentimes they never give over drin∣king day nor night; and thereby besides other inconveniences, they do much wrong their bodyes and witts: and without doubt it is often∣times the cause of their untimely death, according to that of <HI>Properti∣us:</HI> <Q><L>Vino forma perit, vino corrumpitur aetas.</L>
<L>Wine maketh beautie fade,</L>
<L>And strength by Wine is decay'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>And they themselves doe know it, and confesse it, and condemne themselves for it: but in vaine; for the evill custome doth prevaile over them. Albeit they may be partly excused. For seeing the ayre is alwayes moyst and melancholy: they have no other meanes whereby to cure their hatefull, and unwholsome Melancholy: which <HI>Horace</HI> seemeth to intimate, saying: <HI>Vino pellite curas,</HI> that is;
<PB N="438" REF="337"/>
<Q><L>With wine drive cares away,</L>
<L>Which haunt us every day.</L></Q></P>
<P>But it were to be wished that they would observe that noble say∣ing of <HI>Terence: Ne quid nimis:</HI> Doe nothing too much, which now the civiller sort doe begin to observe. The inhabitants doe goe in good apparrell, and are well complexioned. Lastly, they use much trading and traffique, in which they are very skilfull. And all the Low Countries for the most part doth subsist by Merchandising and Maechanicke Arts.</P>

So that even to the yeare 1340. it was a caution used in selling or conveying of land, that if the Sea broake into it within ten yeares afterward, the contract and bargaine should be then voyde and of none effect: The bounds of it now are on the South <HI>Artesia,</HI> with <HI>Hannonia,</HI> &amp; part of <HI>Picardie:</HI> on the East <HI>Hannonia</HI> &amp; <HI>Brabant:</HI> on the North the Ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situati∣on:</NOTE> with <HI>Hon∣ta</HI> or the mouth of <HI>Scaldis,</HI> which parteth <HI>Flanders</HI> from <HI>Zeland:</HI> on the West the <HI>Brittish</HI> Ocean or <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea.

Hulsta,</HI> or <HI>Hulustum,</HI> is the chiefest of them, being a neate Cittie, and well fortified. It endured a grievous seige for some moneths in the yeere 1596. But at length after many assaults, and underminings, and the losse of many thousand men, it was yeelded up to the Archduke <HI>Albertus.

subject to corruption; so we see that flourishing Townes doe decay, so that nothing remaines as it were but their bare Carkasses: and now it is onely a Fortresse. There followeth <HI>Sluce</HI> with the Island of <HI>Cad∣santo. Sluce</HI> is a neate Towne in <HI>Dutch Flanders,</HI> which was hereto∣fore called <HI>Lammerzuliet,</HI> as it appeareth by publicke letters: which was heretofore very rich, it is five miles from <HI>Middleburrough,</HI> and three from <HI>Bruges;</HI> where by an artificiall Aquaeduct, or great chan∣nell, all the water in the Countrie, is collected and gathered into one place, and so brought to the Citty by navigable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hannells: and so ga∣thering it together againe into one pond as it were, at the Towne cal∣led <HI>Damme,</HI> they bring it from thence to the cataracts or fall thereof which they call the <HI>Sluyse:</HI> at the mouth or issue whereof, there is a famous Haven which sometime did enrich <HI>Sluce,</HI> when the Hanse-merchants dwelled there as well as at <HI>Bruges.</HI> It is able to receive an hundred shippes, as also the Annalls of <HI>Flanders</HI> doe testifie, that in the yeare 1468. a little before Christmas, there arrived in this Harbour at one time an hundred and fiftie shippes of great burthen, which was a joyfull sight to the Townsmen. On the side of the Town there is an ancient Castell. In which the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> and the Admirall of the Seas, (the first being taken at <HI>Hisdinum,</HI> the latter at Saint <HI>Quintins</HI> Cittie,) were both kept prisoners. This Castle al∣though it be now disjoyned from the Towne, yet it was formerly joyned thereunto, by many edifices, which the <HI>Brugians</HI> did purpose∣ly pull downe. For the Towne of <HI>Sluce</HI> wearied with their owne dis∣sentions and their wars against the <HI>Brugians,</HI> and lastly the Prince ha∣ving sold it unto them, they came to bee under their jurisdiction. <HI>Sluce</HI> is now a strong fortified Cittie, being entrenched with walls, and a double ditch. <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> in the yeare 1604. did beseige it the Moneth of <HI>May,</HI> and 3 moneths after his coming thither hee com∣pelled them to yeeld for want of food. Nere the Haven of <HI>Sluce</HI> on the six and twentieth of <HI>May</HI> in the yeare 1603 there was a Sea fight of 8 Galleys of <HI>Frederick Spinolaes,</HI> with three ships and eleaven Gallies belonging to the States of the confaederate Provinces, which lay at the mouth of the Haven of <HI>Sluce.</HI> In which fight the Admirall <HI>Spinola</HI> was slaine, and a thousand and 400 men were kill'd and drown'd. The <HI>Zelanders</HI> lost <HI>Iames</HI> the master of a ship, the sonne of <HI>Michael,</HI> and his Mate. There were in the Haven of <HI>Sluce</HI> 2 Block-houses, the one in the very mouth of the Haven commonly called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hase schantse,</HI> the other is seated not farre from the Towne common∣ly call'd <HI>Beck-of:</HI> the former whereof was yeelded to <HI>Grave Mau∣rice,</HI> and the latter taken by force. Over against this Cittie is a small Island which the inhabitants call <HI>Cadsant,</HI> in which there is a Towne of the same name. It was heretofore much larger, having a Cittie in it, and many pleasant and rich townes. Neere unto which at severall times there have beene many sea fights: when either the <HI>Brittaines,</HI> the <HI>Batavians,</HI> or any other enemies to <HI>Flanders</HI> did arrive heere. But this Island is more than half worn away by the tempestuous Seas, &amp; by the tides and ebs thereof. In this Island there are two Fortresses the one whereof <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> tooke being unprovided, the other

commonly called <HI>ter Hofstede</HI> yeelded unto him. A mile hence from <HI>Sluce</HI> is <HI>Ardenburg,</HI> which was heretofore called <HI>Rodenburg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ardenbug.</NOTE> and was heretofore the Metropolis of <HI>Flanders,</HI> containing <HI>Tourout</HI> and <HI>Ostburg,</HI> and <HI>Bruges,</HI> (which were not then walled,) and all the Sea coast even to <HI>Bononia.</HI> But now it is all wasted. It hath a Church consecrated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which is the fairest and most sump∣tuous in all <HI>Flanders.</HI> There is also <HI>Middleburrough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Middlebur∣rough.</NOTE> being two miles and an halfe distant from <HI>Bruges,</HI> being now walled and ditched a∣bout. <HI>Mauritius</HI> in the same yeare tooke these Townes. There is also <HI>Damme</HI> two miles from <HI>Sluce,</HI> which is a very rich Towne, being very populous, and full of Merchants, and a great Haven for wines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damme.</NOTE> being a key of the Sea, in regard that it did shut and open the Ocean, both to those of <HI>Bruges,</HI> and to all Merchants. But now by the incur∣sions of the <HI>French,</HI> and the civill dissentions of the <HI>Gandavians</HI> and <HI>Brugians,</HI> and having lost the recourse of Merchants, it is now but like a Towne or Village, and the Haven is a digged Channell, being onely navigable at a full tyde, three <HI>Flanders</HI> miles, even to <HI>Sluce. Bruges</HI> followeth, which we described before, with the Territorie of the <HI>Francones</HI> or Free-men, because they did shake off the <HI>Bru∣gians</HI> Yoke, and freed themselves from it: and contayneth all that ground which lyeth eight miles round about <HI>Bruges,</HI> and is commonly called <HI>'t Landt Vanden Vryen;</HI> it hath jurisdiction over many free Townes. And these doe make the fourth member of <HI>Flanders.</HI> Last∣ly this Table containeth <HI>Ostend,</HI> which was formerly a poore fisher Towne, wanting munition, but in the yeere 1572 it was walled about.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ostend.</NOTE> It hath a convenient Haven. There came hither eight great Whales in the yeare 1404, every one of them being 74 foote long. Also in the yeare 1426, there was a great Sea Hogge taken, being like unto a Land-Hogge but that it was greater. But in the yeare 1099. and in the yeare 1200, in the Archduke <HI>Alberts</HI> time, the <HI>Flandrians</HI> to restraine the incursions of the enimie, did ditch it round about, and yet they could not hinder their inroades, although it were entren∣ched with 17 Baracadoes and <HI>Bulwarkes,</HI> as the Bulwark or Fort of S. <HI>Catherine,</HI> of <HI>Isabell,</HI> of <HI>Albert,</HI> of <HI>Clara;</HI> wherfore the <HI>Flandrians</HI> were very desirous to beseige this Cittie, which they attempted on the 5 of <HI>Iuly</HI> the yere 1601. The beginning of the seige was very terrible, and continued so to the end thereof, as it is well knowne; yea it was such a long and grievous seige as there was never the like in the memory of man, so that during the time of this seige, there were slaine on both sides about 110000 men. There was a Table book found about a certaine commissary of <HI>Spaine</HI> being dead, in which the number of men that were slaine, were set downe, and the number of women and children by themselves: of which this was the totall summe: Tri∣bunes or Praefects of the Souldiers, commonly called Marshalls of the field 9. of Colonells 15. of Sergeants 29. Captaines 165. Ancients 322. Lieutenants 200 and 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, masters of the Horse 101. Common-souldier 54663. Mariners 611, children and Women 119. The to∣tall summe of all was 72126. It would be tedious to mention all their trenches and Fortresses, all their engines and warlike Instruments, and
<PB N="448" REF="342"/>
other matters. Moreover, there was a battaile fought betweene <HI>Ostend</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> on the second of <HI>Iuly</HI> in the yeere 1600, between the Archduke <HI>Albert,</HI> and <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> in which there were slaine on both sides seaven thousand foote and horsemen. The bat∣tell continued doubtfull for three houres together. But at length <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> got the victory, and overthrew the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> The Archduke <HI>Albert</HI> lost in that fight 6000 men; there were taken be∣sides a great number of common Souldiers, the Admirall of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and with him many of the Nobles, and there were 105 Banners taken from the enemies foote troopes, and foure from his horse troupes. Yet it was a bloody victory to <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> for there were a thou∣sand slaine on his side. A mile distant from <HI>Ostend</HI> is <HI>Aldenburg.</HI> It hath onely one gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aldenburg.</NOTE> being an auncient Cittie, and heretofore a fa∣mous Mart towne.

It was a long time a famous towne of traffique, in regard of the commodiousnesse of the Haven, and the re∣sort of strangers unto it; but when the Haven was filled up with sand, it grew out of esteeme: yet there is hope that if a new Haven were digged, it would be as famous as ever it was. In this Cittie <HI>Levinus Lemnius,</HI> a learned and famous Phisitian was borne and lived. Fi∣shermen doe inhabite <HI>Brouwershavia,</HI> who live by the Sea.

In the yere 1130 it was overflowed with the Sea, to the losse of many people, but afterward the banckes being repaired, and the Sea kept out, that losse was soone recompenced. The third Island is <HI>Tollen,</HI> which is neere unto <HI>Brabant,</HI> being onely parted and divided from it by a straite narrow sea, in which is <HI>Toletum;</HI> which the Low countriemen in re∣gard of the custome and tribute which is payd there, doe call <HI>Tolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> being an auncient little Towne: and not farre from thence is the <HI>Martinian</HI> bancke, commonly called S. <HI>Martines Dijck,</HI> being a plea∣sant place, and planted round about with trees, in which great store of fowle, especially Hernes doe breede.

but on this condition, that they should take the same oath to be faith∣full subjects to the Emperour, and his lawfull heyres being Dukes of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and Earles of <HI>Holland;</HI> reserving to himselfe and his suc∣cessor the Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, and revennewes onely, with the Bishops Pallace. Afterward the Citties and Countrie of <HI>Vltra∣jectum,</HI> were united with the other Provinces, and it was agreed, that the Countrie of <HI>Vltrajectum,</HI> should be so firmely united to <HI>Holland,</HI> that they should be afterward ruled by one Governour, and that the States of either Provinces, should be called together; and that it should be in the Praefects power to change yeerely the Magistrates of all the Citties in either Province. And also that those who had beene banished in <HI>Holland,</HI> should not be received into <HI>Vltrajectum.</HI> And that all Tenures should runne in these words: That they should hold in Fee of the County of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Vltrajectum.</HI> But in the yere 1580. after the decease of <HI>Fredericke</HI> Bishop of <HI>Tantenburg,</HI> the States did assume unto themselves the governement of the Cittie of <HI>Vltrajectum,</HI> and afterward the <HI>Vltrajectensians</HI> as confederates with the other States of the united Provinces, did acknowledge no other Lord but the States. These things being unfolded, let us come now to the Cittie. This countrie is encompassed on the North, West, and the South almost on every side with the Countie of <HI>Holland:</HI> on the East it is bounded with the Dukedome of <HI>Gelderland.</HI> It hath a good fertile soyle. Which as it is higher and dryer, so is it much more fit for tillage. Heere are five walled Citties, namely <HI>Vltrajectum, Batava∣durum, Rhena, Amersford,</HI> and <HI>Montfort. Vltrajectum</HI> which is the Metropolis of the Province was so named, as <HI>Iunius Hadrian</HI> wit∣nesseth, from the Romaine armies which lay by <HI>Rhene.</HI> For in that place where the Cittie now standeth, the five and thirtieth Legion was quartered, which was thus written by abbreviation, <HI>V.

Afterward this word <HI>Vtricstat</HI> was changed into <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> Neither is it a strange mat∣ter, seeing the Cittie <HI>Cantstat</HI> in Southland, did take his name from these words, <HI>Leg.

It is thought also that it was called <HI>Antonia</HI> from <HI>Antoninus</HI> a Romaine Senator, who having left <HI>Rome,</HI> in regard of <HI>Neroes</HI> Tyran∣nie; came into those coasts and built this Cittie. And afterward the <HI>Wiltians</HI> did depopulate and waste it, and built there a faire Castell, which they called after their name <HI>Wiltenburg,</HI> which Castell <HI>Dage∣bert</HI> the sonne of <HI>Clotarius</HI> did take by force of armes, and having fortified it more strongly than it was before, called it <HI>Trajectum,</HI> be∣cause it is a passage for those that travell that way, and there is a cer∣taine Toll payd there: Which appeareth by these verses which are to be seene in S. <HI>Martines</HI> Church: <Q><LG>

<L>Holland is compass'd in on every side</L>

<L>In which that Cittie which they Antonia call</L>
<L>Was built in <HI>Neroes</HI> time with a new wall;</L>
<L>Which a fierce Nation did with fire soone wast,</L>
<L>And the Wiltian Castell was built there at last</L>
<L>With high built Towers; which the Abroditan</L>
<L>People did raze even to the ground againe.</L>
<L>Then the Castell of Trajectum with a wall,</L>
<L>The Frenchmen builded, who were Christians all.</L>
<L>The Danes did cast it to the ground againe,</L>
<L>When they the Clergie and Cittizens had slaine.</L>
<L>At last the Bishop <HI>Baldricke</HI> did command,</L>
<L>That new walls should be built, which yet doe stand.</L>
<L>So that it seemes, that still Trajectum is</L>
<L>Hollands chiefe Cittie and Metropolis.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>This Bishop <HI>Balderick,</HI> who (as these verss doe mention) walled this Cittie, was surnamed <HI>Clivensis,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Bald,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> gave him the Citties of <HI>Daven∣tria,</HI> and <HI>Tiela,</HI> with all the Territories thereunto adjoyning, both for repairing the Cathedrall Church, and for his government in his Bishopricke. It appeareth that this Cittie was heretofore called <HI>An∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia,</HI> not onely by the aforesayd verses, but also by the testimony of divers writings, and by inscriptions upon coyne and auncient stones, and monuments found heretofore. Yet it is doubtfull whether this name were derived from <HI>Antoninus,</HI> the Romane Senator: for some do report that it was so called from <HI>Marcus Antonius,</HI> who was at that time <HI>Caesars</HI> embassador in <HI>France,</HI> who afterward together with <HI>Octavianus Augustus,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Lepidus,</HI> did assume unto them∣selves the whole government of the <HI>Romane</HI> Commonwealth. Last∣ly, others doe alleage, that it was so called from the Emperour <HI>Mar∣cus Antoninus Pius,</HI> who did reëdifie it when it was decayed. <HI>Vltra∣jectum</HI> is situate by the old channell of <HI>Rhene,</HI> which River before

that it broke into <HI>Lecca,</HI> did runne that way, and from thence did ha∣sten onward to the Ocean.

Moreover it is observeable, that this Cittie is so seated, that in one day you may goe on foote to which you please of fiftie Townes which stand round about it, being no farther distant from it than wee sayd before (as appeareth also by the Geographicall Table,) all of which before these troublesome times of warre, did belong to the King of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Moreover any one that setteth forth in the morning, from <HI>Vltrajectum,</HI> may walke softly to any of those sixe and twenty Citties aforesayd, and there refresh themselves and make merry, and at evening come home. This is a great Cittie, pleasant, and powerfull, having many stately publicke and private aedifices; it hath a faire strong Castell, built by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, and called in their speech <HI>Vredenburch.</HI> The Churches thereof are very magnificent, and especially these five which belonged heretofore to so many auncient Colledges of Cannons: Namely our Saviours Church, S. <HI>Martines</HI> Church, S. <HI>Peters,</HI> S. <HI>Iohns,</HI> and S. <HI>Maries.</HI> But the sumptuous and faire Church of Saint <HI>Martine,</HI> doth exceede all the rest, which is a Bishops seate. The Bishop <HI>Adelboldus,</HI> cau∣sed this Church to be pulled downe, and afterward to be built up a∣gaine more fairely; it was reëdified in the yeare 1023, and twelve Bishops did consecrate it in the presence of the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the first, as these verses doe declare: <Q><LG>

<P>This Saint <HI>Maries</HI> Church is very faire and beautifull, and was built by the Emperour <HI>Fredericke,</HI> as a mulct and charge imposed on him by the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> for wasting the famous Cittie of <HI>Mediola∣num,</HI> and destroying the Churches therein. It was strange that at the laying of the foundation of this Church, there was a quicksand found, on which they could not build, but that it would still sincke; at length they cast Oxe hides into it, which made the ground sollid and firme, so that they built this Church on it, in remembrance whereof these verses are extant in <HI>Vltrajectum:</HI> <Q><L>Accipe Posteritas quod post tua secula narres;</L>

<HEAD>THE CITTIE AND PROVINCE OF MACHLIN.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Achlin</HI> is situated almost in the middle of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and is as it were enclosed within it, neere the River <HI>Dilia,</HI> which cutteth through the middle of it, being equally distant from <HI>Antwerp, Bruxells,</HI> and <HI>Lovanium,</HI> in a Champi∣on Countrie and fertile soyle, having a light and sandie ground; the Cittie is very faire &amp; conspicuous, both in regard of the pleasantnesse of the situation, the cleanenesse and breadth of the streetes, the large∣nesse and curiousnesse of the houses: some reckon it as a part of <HI>Bra∣bant,</HI> but yet truely it is a distinct country from it. There are divers uncertaine conjectures concerning the originall thereof; but this is manifest, that in one of the letters Pattents of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> dated in the yeare 753, there is mention made of it, and that it is there called <HI>Mastinas,</HI> as it were the line of the Sea, because the Sea doth flow and ebbe before it; which Etymologie pleaseth some better, than to call it <HI>Machel</HI> from one <HI>Michael</HI> who possessed these parts, as <HI>Ortelius</HI> doth deliver in his Itinerarie of the Low Countries. Others doe deduce the name from other derivations. But as we sayd, <HI>Mach∣lin,</HI> after the yeare 753, had <HI>Adon</HI> to be Earle thereof, which he held by fealty and service.

The chiefe Cittie is <HI>Lutzen∣burg,</HI> some call it <HI>Lucemburg,</HI> and <HI>Luceburg; Ptolomie</HI> calls it <HI>Augusta Romandiorum. Guicciardine</HI> would have it called <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> as it were <HI>Lucisburg,</HI> that is, the Castell of the Sunne: as also many other places in this tract may seeme to have beene named from the gods of the <HI>Gentiles:</HI> as <HI>Arlun</HI> from the Altar of the Moone, <HI>Iuois</HI> from <HI>Iupi∣ter, Marche</HI> from <HI>Mars;</HI> but whether the name be rightly derived from hence, let another judge. The Cittie is situate most pleasantly, part of it on the side of a Mountaine, and part of it on plaine ground: The River <HI>Elza</HI> doth water, and divideth the higher and lower mountainous part of the Cittie, from the lower part. There are many faire aedifices and houses in it, which yet the warres have somewhat defac'd: and also a Church consecrate to S. <HI>Nicolas:</HI> and a Mona∣stery to S. <HI>Francis,</HI> in which <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> the sonne of the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the seaventh, and father of <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth, was buryed. This Citty hath beene often defaced by the fury of <HI>Mars,</HI> who hath no agreement with the <HI>Muses,</HI> who love peace and tranquility; yet it hath bred many famous learned men. And among many others, <HI>Nicolas Navis</HI> a man so learned and skilfull in the civill law, that he was Praesident of the Court at <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> untill he dyed: but he left a sonne of his owne name, who being equall to his father in vertue, was in such favour with the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, that he made him Vicechancellour of the whole Empire, in which office he continued untill his death. <HI>Arlunum</HI> which is cal∣led in their language, is situate on the top of a hill, being a very neate town, where the Moone was worshipped after the manner of the hea∣thens, and from thence it is supposed to have beene so named. Heere many Monuments of antiquitie are found, which the Earle <HI>Peter Ernest</HI> caused to be brought home to his owne house, which is in the suburbs of the Cittie of <HI>Lutzenburg.

<P>This Dukedome hath two Marquiships under it, seaven Counties, many <HI>Baronies,</HI> and Lordships, and great store of Noble men, so that to Province doth produce so many. All of them doe live magnifi∣cently, and are curteous, vertuous, constant, and faithfull to their Prince. Their exercise is Armes and hunting. They live civilly and courteously together, visiting one another in mutuall kindnesses. They contract marriages with their neighbours, and in their matches they doe more respect honour and dignity than portion. If any one doe commit an enormity, he loseth his credit, and is not admittted to converse with the Nobles, and is thought to be unworthy of any pub∣licke office, and his oath is not esteemed in publicke trialls. If any controversie doe arise amongst them, they referre it to certaine Ar∣bitrators, who are to compound and end the matter, so that they have no great use of Lawyers and Proctors: yet they are too much given to wine. And the Country people doe complaine very much of their hard usage and servitude, so that if a Country-man intend to put forth his children, he cannot doe it without his Lords leave, which is farre different from the libertie of the Low Countries. <HI>Arlunum,</HI> which we mentioned before, is situate on the top of a Mountaine, and is foure miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> and sixe from <HI>Mommedy.</HI> It was sometime a faire Towne, but somewhat defaced by the violence of warres. <HI>Rodemachera</HI> is three miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> which though it be no great towne, yet is very beautifull, and fortified with a strong Castell. <HI>Theodonis-villa,</HI> which in <HI>Dutch</HI> is called <HI>Dieten∣h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> is very conveniently situated on the left hand bancke of the Ri∣ver <HI>Mosella:</HI> it is foure miles from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> having a faire bridge; it is a pleasant strong Towne and well fortified against the invasions of enemies. <HI>Regino</HI> affirmeth that <HI>Charles</HI> the Great was used to hunt very much neere unto this Cittie. <HI>Gravemakerum</HI> and <HI>Koninck∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akerum</HI> are small little Townes neere <HI>Mosella,</HI> being a mile distant one from another, and 5 miles from <HI>Lutzenburg. Dieterichum</HI> is sea∣ted neere the little River <HI>Sure,</HI> and is five miles distant from <HI>Lutzen∣burg. Viretonum</HI> and <HI>Echternatum</HI> are little small townes, and are both five miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg. Vianda</HI> standeth by the side of a little Riuulet, seaven miles from <HI>Lutzenburg;</HI> it hath a Countie belonging to it, and is subject to the Prince of <HI>Orange. Ba∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nacum</HI> is neere unto the Forrest of <HI>Arden,</HI> being three miles from the new Castell, and 17 from <HI>Lutzenburg.</HI> It is a little Towne, but so famous heretofore that it was called <HI>Paris en Ardenne,</HI> in regard of the markets for Cattell and Corne, which were usually kept there, whither the Countrie round about did bring all sorts of commodi∣ties to the great enriching of the Towne. Betweene this Cittie and <HI>Arlunum,</HI> and S. <HI>Huberts</HI> Church, there are some Villages in the middle of the wood, in which the women after the <HI>Spanish</HI> fashion,
<PB N="504" REF="379"/>
when their husbands are carryed forth to be buried and interred, doe runne crying and weeping through the streetes, tearing their hayre and scratching their faces; with their nayles, in a mad and furious manner, which custome doth rather savour of Heatheanisme than Christianity. <HI>Mommedium</HI> is conveniently situated on a high moun∣taine, at the foote whereof the River <HI>Chirsus</HI> glideth along; it is nine miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> and foure from <HI>Danvillieres,</HI> being a faire fortified towne. <HI>New-Castell</HI> is in <HI>Ardenne;</HI> it is 5 Miles distant from <HI>Ivosium,</HI> and nine from <HI>Lutzenburg;</HI> it is now a small Towne, and much decayed. <HI>Danvillieres</HI> is twelve miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg;</HI> and foure from <HI>Verdunum,</HI> being in <HI>Lothariagia. Mar∣ville</HI> is divided into two parts, the one whereof is subject to the Duke of <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> and the other to the Duke of <HI>Lotharingia;</HI> and therefore it is called the common Towne; it standeth by the Ri∣ver <HI>Chirsus,</HI> and is 12 miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg. Roch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en Ar∣denne,</HI> or the Rocke in <HI>Ardenne,</HI> and <HI>Durbium</HI> are twelve miles distant from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> being both pleasantly seated.

First <HI>Ivosium</HI> which is 12 miles from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> and foure from <HI>Mommedy,</HI> being heretofore a good strong Town, but at last <HI>Henry</HI> the second, King of <HI>France,</HI> be∣girt it round with an Armie in the yeare 1552. and tooke it; but after∣ward a peace being made, it was restored backe againe to <HI>Philip</HI> the second, King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> but the walls were ruinated as at <HI>Teroana,</HI> and a law was made that it should not be walled in againe. <HI>Chinium</HI> is 12. miles from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> which is unwalled, but by degrees it is re∣edified. It hath a County belonging to it, although it be subject to the Archdukes, and hath a large jurisdiction over some townes and Villages, neither is it subject to the Dukedome of <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> but is joyned unto it. Twelve miles from <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> standeth the Towne <HI>la Ferte</HI> neere the River <HI>Chirsus,</HI> being heretofore a pleasant Cittie, and now also it flourisheth although it be unwalled, and a great part of the Castell be fallen downe, but so much concerning these things.

Moreover the Countie of <HI>Valden.</HI> was in the possession of <HI>Iohn</HI> the third of that name Duke of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣bant;</HI> who tooke it by force of armes from <HI>Raynout,</HI> Lord of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣burg:</HI> who being a troublesome man, and having injured the <HI>Tra∣jectenses</HI> at the River <HI>Mosa,</HI> was overcome and taken prisoner by the aforesayd Duke. <HI>Dalthemium</HI> is a little Towne, with a small Castell belonging to it. It is three long miles from <HI>Aquisgranum,</HI> and two from <HI>Leodium.</HI> It is honoured with the title of a Countie, and hath some <HI>Villages</HI> and lands beyond <HI>Mosa,</HI> which are within the juris∣diction thereof. <HI>Henry</HI> the second, Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> did possesse it, and did joyne it to his owne Territories. The famous Abby of the Valley of God belongs to <HI>Dalthemium,</HI> the Abbot whereof is the chiefe man of that Countrie, and besides this, there is the Abby of the holy Crosse. <HI>Rolducum</HI> is an old Towne with an ancient Ca∣stell. It is a mile distant from <HI>Valkenburg,</HI> and it is the fourth Lordship beyond <HI>Mosa,</HI> and it hath a Tribunall or Court of Iustice, but the Senate of <HI>Brabant</HI> have the oversight of it. Here I cannot passe by the village commonly called <HI>Carpen,</HI> betweene <HI>Iuliacum</HI> and the <HI>Colonie,</HI> being two long miles from the <HI>Rhene.</HI> It is as big as a little Towne, and hath a Collegiate Church as they call it, and hath Faires and Markets, whither all sorts of commodities are brought, and a great confluence of people doe resort unto it: it hath also a Castell well fortified. <HI>William Nassavius</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> passing over the <HI>Rhene</HI> tooke it in the yeare 1568, and fortified it with a Garrison. All these parts being gathered together doe make a great Lordship, which was used to be governed by a peculiar Lord, but the Dukes of <HI>Limburg</HI> have now subjected it to themselves, although it have a Prefect be∣side, who lyeth there with a strong Garrison. This Countrie hath three other Rivulets besides <HI>Mosa,</HI> which at length become Rivers; namely <HI>Beruinum</HI> which watereth <HI>Dalthemium, Geuda</HI> which runneth
<PB N="509" REF="382"/>
by <HI>Valckenburg,</HI> and <HI>Worma</HI> which glideth by <HI>Rodulcum.</HI> Moreover as well the Dukedome of <HI>Limburg,</HI> as the other States and Lord∣ships aforesayd, doe consist of three members, namely the Cler∣gie, the Nobles, and the Iudges. The Dukedome of <HI>Limburg</HI> doth containe five members or divisions, which they call <HI>Bancas, Hervi∣um, Spremontium, Balenium, Walhornum,</HI> and <HI>Montzium:</HI> the two former whereof are governed by Majors, and the three latter by magistrates called <HI>Drossards.</HI> And so much concerning the Duke∣dome of <HI>Limburg,</HI> and the appendances thereunto, I passe to the rest.</P>

<HEAD>A PROFITABLE instruction concerning the Ta∣bles of GERMANIE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Orasmuch as the Romaine Empire is in the power of the <HI>Germaines,</HI> and very politickely divided into parts, I thinke it a matter worth my labour to set before your eyes the order and disposition of those parts, as they are de∣scribed in a writing called <HI>Matricula Imperij:</HI> and afterward to shew you in Tables the severall members of this Empire, that the stu∣dious Reader may finde in what Country they are situated. But I have gotten two Coppies of this <HI>Matricula,</HI> the one written; the other printed at <HI>Venice</HI> in <HI>Italian,</HI> being both much corrupted. And I know that the Empire is now divided in another manner. Therefore let no man blame me, or be offended, if he finde some parts that are recko∣ned as belonging to the Empire, doe not belong thereunto, for it is not my intention to speake expressely of all the severall parts of this Empire, neither was it possible for me to do, out of such corrupt Cop∣pies; especially seeing that I know that a great part of the Empire, came into the hands of private Princes, either by Exchange, or Mor∣gage, or gifts, for their good service in defence of the Empire, or for some other causes. Neither is it my part to prosecute those things which belong to Politicians, and not Geographers, but onely I sought that out of this Coppie of <HI>Matricula,</HI> I might shew the elegant disposition and division of the Empire of <HI>Germany,</HI> and might de∣clare how the studdies of Geographie, and <HI>Policie</HI> doe mutually illu∣strate one another. This is therefore the order of the Empire.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hus you have seene the description of the Low coutrie both in generall and speciall: now passing over the <HI>Rhene</HI> high <HI>Germanie,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> calls great <HI>Germanie,</HI> of∣fers it selfe, which is the largest Country of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the glory of the Romaine Empire. This Country I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nne over in the same method as I did the other, describing it first in generall, and then in particular. But that I may begin with the name thereof, divers doe diversly derive the name of <HI>Germanie</HI> or the <HI>Germaines.</HI> One saith, that the <HI>Germaines</HI> were so called as it were <HI>Germanie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is, stout men, in regard of their Martiall manly strength another supposeth that they were so named, from their mutuall fidelity, and faithfulnesse; neither did he guesse much amisse, who deriveth the Etymologie of their name from their honourable warfare, as if the people were called <HI>Geertmans,</HI> and so by contraction of the word <HI>Germanes.</HI> Another thinketh that they were so determinated from the Latine word <HI>genuini,</HI> that is, genuine or native because no nation doth retaine more of their auncient integritie, and justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sim∣plicity: but it seemes that the author of this dreame did speake this to gaine the favour of the people: albeit the <HI>Geographer</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Livy</HI> doe both erroniously suppose that the <HI>Roma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> people did give this name to this country, because they were Cosen Germaines to the <HI>Celtae,</HI> both in regard of their manners, and fashi∣ons, and also in respect of their great stature, and red haue <HI>Iohn G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ropius Becanus</HI> doth probably derive the name thereof from their ga∣thering and mustering of souldiours, from <HI>Geren,</HI> which signifies to gather or muster. Which opinion <HI>Tacitus</HI> seemes to fortitie and con∣firme, who professeth in his commentarie of the <HI>Germanies</HI> manners, that <HI>Germany</HI> is a new fresh name, because they who first passed over <HI>Rhene</HI> (that I may use his owne words) having droven on the <HI>French∣men,</HI> were sometime called <HI>Tungrians,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Germanies,</HI> which name afterward grew so frequent, that first the Conquerour, and afterward they themselves, did call themselves <HI>Germanies.</HI> Some doe interpret the word <HI>Germaine</HI> to signifie a scattered people, col∣lected out of other nations, from the word <HI>Geren</HI> which signifies to collect or gather together. Some doe suppose their denomination doth intimate that they were a warlike people desirous of warre, from <HI>Gerra,</HI> or <HI>Guerra,</HI> which signifies warre. A learned <HI>Saxon</HI> doth derive the name thereof from the <HI>Carmanians</HI> a people of <HI>Asia,</HI> whom <HI>Lucan</HI> mentioneth, as the <HI>Saxons</HI> were so called from the <HI>Sa∣cians:</HI> and in other places he deduces the Etymologie of their namely from an Hebrew word, as it were <HI>Ger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mani,</HI> which in that language signifies strangers or poore and needy people. But <HI>Pencerus</HI> deligh∣ting in the studious searching out the originall of his Countries name, thinketh that they were called <HI>Germaines,</HI> as it were <HI>Hermenner;</HI> that is, military men. The most learned <HI>Iunius</HI> doth derive the na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of it
<PB N="519" REF="387"/>
from the great <HI>Deluge,</HI> which drowned all the world: when <HI>Noah</HI> parted the world among his three children: at what time (that I may speake nothing of <HI>Sem</HI> and <HI>Cham) Europe</HI> fell to <HI>Iaphets</HI> share. He, as it appeares in <HI>Moyses,</HI> had a sonne, called <HI>Gomer,</HI> who had three sonnes, <HI>Aschenaz, Rephat,</HI> and <HI>Thogarma.</HI> And they affirme that the <HI>Germaines</HI> descended from <HI>Thogarma:</HI> although the <HI>Rabines</HI> doe hold that the <HI>Germaines</HI> came from <HI>Aschenazin.</HI> For the originall of the <HI>Germaines</HI> name doth cleerely shine forth in the word <HI>Thogarma,</HI> or <HI>Thegerma,</HI> by taking the second vowell for the first, as if we should pronounce it in our language by the article the, The <HI>Germans:</HI> also there is a fit Etymologie answerable to the word and nation, which is from <HI>Gara</HI> or <HI>Gera,</HI> which signifies a bone, and metaphorically strength, because it is a stout and strongbon'd Nation. Some also doe call this part of <HI>Europe Alemaine,</HI> and the inhabitants thereof <HI>Ale∣mans,</HI> by which name they were first called, when the Empire began to decline. <HI>Berosus</HI> doth fabulously report, it was so called from <HI>Her∣cules</HI> an <HI>Alemaine,</HI> who was governour over these people. Some suppose that it was called <HI>Alemaine,</HI> from <HI>Mannus</HI> who was estee∣med as a god in their Country, the sonne of <HI>Tuiscon. Asinius Qua∣drus</HI> a faithfull historian, doth affirme that the <HI>Almaines,</HI> were so called as it were a people collected and gathered from all Nations, which spread themselves all over this Country; who did not, as it seemes, looke exactly into the signification of the word, for he should have called them <HI>Almaines</HI> because they were all men, and warri∣ours. They that derive <HI>Alemanie</HI> from the Lake <HI>Lemann,</HI> would have <HI>Germany</HI> so called from a Lake without the limits thereof in <HI>Sa∣ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> unlesse some doe take the <HI>Aeronian</HI> Lake for the Lake <HI>Leman,</HI> on either bank whereof the <HI>Almaines</HI> did inhabit, as <HI>Ammianus</HI> re∣porteth <HI>Lib.</HI> 15. And though some do promiscuously make <HI>Germanie</HI> &amp; <HI>Almany</HI> al one, yet it is observed that they were two distinct Coun∣tries. <HI>Spartianus</HI> in the life of <HI>Marius</HI> saith: <HI>Omnis Alemannia, om∣nisque Germania, cum caeteris quae adjacent gentibus;</HI> that is, All <HI>Alma∣ny,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> with the other adjacent countries. <HI>Flavius Vopiscus</HI> saith in the lif of <HI>Probus: Testes sunt Franci, inuijs strati paludibus, testes Germani &amp; Alemanni, longe a Rheni semoti littoribus,</HI> that is, The <HI>Frenchmen</HI> are witnesses, who dwell in the Low grounds, the <HI>Ger∣maines</HI> are witnesses, and the <HI>Almaines</HI> who are farre off from the shoares of <HI>Rhene.</HI> I omit other testimonies, least I should be tedious. Some also doe call it <HI>Teutonia,</HI> from <HI>Teuto</HI> a certaine Captaine there∣of some thinke that the <HI>Teutons,</HI> who are called in their owne Coun∣trie speech <HI>Teutche,</HI> and by the <HI>Italians Tedaschi,</HI> and by others <HI>Teu∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> were so called from <HI>Thuista,</HI> otherwise <HI>Thursco,</HI> whom they be∣leeve was the Sonne of <HI>Noah. Tacitus</HI> maketh mention heereof: <HI>Celebrant carminibus antiquis (quod unum apud illos memoriae &amp; Anna∣lium genus est) Thuistonem deum terra editum &amp; filium Mannum, ori∣ginem gentis, conditoresque;</HI> that is, they celebrate in auncient verses (which kinde of Annalls they doe onely use) That <HI>Thuisto</HI> an earthy God and his sonne <HI>Mannus,</HI> were the first founders of this Nation. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rabo</HI> placeth them in <HI>Noricum:</HI> some suppose that they were the
<PB N="520" REF="388"/>
<HI>Agrippine Colonie,</HI> and that the place was therefore called <HI>Teutsch.</HI> The inhabitants doe now call it <HI>Teutschlandt,</HI> and strangers <HI>Almany.</HI> The <HI>Sclavonians</HI> doe call it <HI>Nimiecha:</HI> and the <HI>Graecians</HI> doe now call it <HI>Elamags,</HI> and the <HI>Turkes Alaman.</HI> But enough concerning the Etymologie and various appellations of <HI>Germanie,</HI> now I come to the situation or quantitie thereof. Besides, authors doe not agree in designing and setting downe the limits of <HI>Germanie.</HI> The auncients doe bounder <HI>Germany</HI> with the <HI>Rhene, Danubius,</HI> the Ocean, the Ri∣ver <HI>Tanais</HI> and the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea. The latter writers, as <HI>Strab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Pto∣lemie, Mela, Plinnie,</HI> and many other Greeke and Latine writers, doe bounder it with the River <HI>Rhene</HI> and <HI>Vestula. Tacitus</HI> writeth that the mountaines, or a mutuall distrust one of another, doth rather separate the <HI>Germaines</HI> from the <HI>Sarmatians</HI> and <HI>Dacians,</HI> than <HI>Vi∣stula.</HI> All those Countries which use the <HI>Germaine</HI> speech or dialect are reckoned now as parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> And therefore it stretcheth beyond those bounds which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> gives it, and beyond <HI>Danubius,</HI> contayning <HI>Rhetia, Vindelicia,</HI> the higher <HI>Pannonia,</HI> and beyond <HI>Il∣lyra,</HI> even to the <HI>Tridentine</HI> bounds. Also beyond the <HI>Rhene, Germa∣tie</HI> did containe these <HI>Romaine</HI> Colonies, and garrisons, <HI>Constantia, Augusta Rauracorum, Argentina, Nemetes, Vangiones, Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cia∣cum, Confluentia, Bonna,</HI> the <HI>Agrippine Colonie,</HI> and other places even unto the Sea. For as <HI>Ambrosius</HI> witnesseth, 11 <HI>Hexamer, Rhene</HI> was heretofore the limmit of the <HI>Romaine</HI> Empire: and that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>French</HI> bancke thereof the <HI>Romaine</HI> Praesidents did alwayes lye in gar∣rison against the <HI>Germaines,</HI> partly that they might restraine their excursions, and partly that they might make inroads upon them, and partly that they might receive those <HI>Germaines</HI> that revolted to them. And this is the Reason, that on one of the banckes of <HI>Rhene,</HI> there are many old Cities, but none on the other: which may also be observed on the bancke of <HI>Danubius. Helvetia,</HI> also is reckoned now as a part of <HI>Germanie:</HI> &amp; the <HI>Prutenians</HI> beyond <HI>Vistula:</HI> so that the bounds there∣of are now much larger than those which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> attributes to it: for on the West it stretcheth beyond the <HI>Rhene,</HI> even to <HI>Pice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate</HI> and <HI>Burgundie,</HI> which are parts of <HI>France:</HI> on the South toward <HI>Danubi∣us</HI> even to the <HI>Alpes:</HI> On the East beyond even to <HI>Sprasland:</HI> the Northerne limit is the Ocean. There are many chiefe parts of <HI>Ger∣manie,</HI> which shall be here described, with the lesser subject o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ad∣jacent countries. The Kingdomes are, <HI>Bohemia,</HI> the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and the Kingdome of <HI>Poland,</HI> though it hath a different language, and is not contained in the Register of the Empire, yet because it is situate within the bounds of auncient <HI>Germanie,</HI> which is the River <HI>Vistula,</HI> therefore we place it among the tables of <HI>Germanie.</HI> Also we joyne the Kingdome of <HI>Hungarie</HI> to <HI>Germanie,</HI> which is situate without the limmits of auncient <HI>Germanie,</HI> and in regard it hath yeelded many famous Emperours, and hath dominion over many Countries situate within the Empire. There are also the Dukedome of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> the Arch dukedome of <HI>Austria.</HI> Also the Dukedomes of <HI>Holst,</HI> of <HI>Mech∣lenburg, Pomeren, Lunenburg, Lawenburg, Brunswijck, Metssen, Schle∣sen, Moravia, Cleve, Berge, Franconia,</HI> or Easterne <HI>France, Bavar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,

Wirtenberg,</HI> and the Countie of <HI>Suevia:</HI> the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the <HI>Landgraviats</HI> of <HI>Hessen, Duringen,</HI> and of the higher and lower <HI>Alsatia.</HI> The <HI>Marckgraniate</HI> Electorship of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and of <HI>Baden,</HI> the Counties of <HI>Embdem, Oldenburg, Benthem, Lip, Diepholt, Huy, Mansfelt, Anholt, Stolberg, Tirol,</HI> and <HI>Livonia</HI> which is reckoned among the Provinces of <HI>Germany,</HI> but because it lyeth within <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> it is there described. The situation being declared, the qualitie of the soyle followeth, which ariseth chiefe∣ly from the climate and position thereof in respect of the hea∣vens. <HI>Germany</HI> is under the sixt, seaventh, and eighth climates, betweene the fourtie seaventh and fiftie five degrees of Latitude, and the twentie fourth and forty sixth degrees of Longitude. The longest day in sommer in the Southerne parallel is fifteene houres long and an halfe: in the Northerne Parallel, it is seaventeene houres long and a quarter; and albeit <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> saith, that <HI>Ger∣many</HI> is in a cold sharpe climate, and <HI>Seneca</HI> reporteth that it is alwayes winter in <HI>Germanie:</HI> yet it hath a temperate ayre, which though it bee somewhat cold, yet it is healthfull and whole∣some.</P>
<P>The soyle yeeldeth Barly, Wheate, Rye, Mill, Oates, and o∣ther kindes of corne and pulse. The fields and Meddowes are fruit∣full, and the soyle is every where very fertile, and yeeldeth great foure of Corne. <HI>Germanie</HI> also hath rich Mines of Silver, Brasse, Iron, Lead, and other mettals, and in some places of gold: so that for mettalls it is inferiour to no Countrie. There are also many excellent Salt pitts. <HI>Plinnie</HI> also saith, the Cadmian stones, the Callais, the Crystall, the Onyx, the Topaz, and the Adamant; are found in <HI>Germanie.</HI> Also the hearbes. Heere are a thousand delightfull gardens, and Villages, and Orchards full of Apples.</P>
<P>What, should I mention the wines? which are of an excellent taste and colour? Truely there are excellent wines every where, but yet in some places better than in others. Heere is also great variety of living creatures, and great stoare of Cattell and wilde beasts, which I will not spend time to reckon up. <HI>C. Iulius Cae∣sar</HI> writeth, that many kindes of wilde beasts are bred in the Wood <HI>Hercynia,</HI> which are not seene in any other place; of which (saith hee) those that differ most from the rest, and are most worthy of remembrance are these: there is a kinde of Oxe which is like a Hart, which hath in the middle of his forehead one high horne, and more straite than usuall, from the toppe whereof large Antletts or Tines doe spread forth; the male and femall are of one shape, and have one as bigge hornes as the other. There is also a beast called Alcis, which is like unto a Goate, but it is somewhat bigger, and having no hornes at all, and their legges are without joynts, so that they cannot by any meanes lye downe to their rest, or if they fall downe by chance, they cannot rise up againe; therefore they leane against trees, and so they take their rest: and when the hunters have found by their
<PB N="522" REF="389"/>
footing where they usually haunt, they either stub up all the trees, or else they cut them halfe downe, and so leave them standing: So that when the beasts rest against them according to their usuall manner, they overthrow the trees with their weight, and so fall downe with them. The third kind of beasts are those which are called <HI>Vri,</HI> which are almost as bigge as Elephants, and like Bulls in shape and colour▪ they are very strong, and swift, and will prey on men and beasts: these they usually take in trappes, and so kill them. But now I come to the auncient government. The sacred Romaine Empire, which being divided into the West and Easterne part, was much weakned by the excursions of divers Nations, and rent by civill dissentions, was ready to be ruined by its owne weight; having forsooke <HI>Italie</HI> did seeke defence and strength in no other Countrie but <HI>Germanie,</HI> and chose <HI>Charles</HI> the Great King of <HI>France</HI> to be Emperour, who as they report, was borne at <HI>Ingelheimij,</HI> which is a village Towre two miles from <HI>Moguntiacum,</HI> and built there a famous Pallace, whose ruines may be yet seene. The Empire remained in <HI>Charles</HI> his line an hundred yeares, and above: which afterward failing, it was tran∣slated to <HI>Conrade</HI> Duke of <HI>Franconia:</HI> after whom followed <HI>Henry Fowler:</HI> after him the three <HI>Ottoes:</HI> the last whereof when he un∣derstood that the <HI>Romaines, Crescentius</HI> being consull, did affect and desire the title of the Empire, he raysed an army and tooke <HI>Rome,</HI> and obtayned of Pope <HI>Gregorie,</HI> that the <HI>Germaines</HI> should have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and power to elect the <HI>Romaine</HI> Emperours. But they obtayned it on this condition, that he which was elected should be called <HI>Caesar</HI> and King of the <HI>Romaines:</HI> and afterward having received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crowne from the Pope, he hath the title of Emperour <HI>Augustus.</HI> There are 7 Electors ordained: of which three are Archbishops, and soule are saecular Princes as they call them: where after the decease of <HI>Otto,</HI> the first, that was chosen Emperour was <HI>Henry</HI> surnamed the holy. Afterward in processe of time, there were divers officers constituted and ordained in <HI>Germany,</HI> for the honour of the Empire concerning which see <HI>Mercator. Tacitus</HI> who was governour of the <HI>Belgians</HI> under <HI>Vespasian,</HI> doth commend the <HI>Germaines</HI> in this short <HI>Elogie</HI> thus: <HI>Nemo bellum Germanis (inquit) intulit impune.</HI> None made warre upon the <HI>Germaines</HI> but they came by the losse. Which, three of <HI>Augustus</HI> Legions found, being overcome and beaten by them: Al∣so <HI>Carbo, Cassius, Scaurus, Aurelius, Servilius, Coepie, Manlius,</HI> all great Commanders, who were slaine and put to flight. And there are these auncient verses: <Q><L>Welcher im Krieg wil ungluck han,</L>
<L>Der fang es mit den Deutschen an.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Iosephus</HI> calleth them valiant, <HI>Dionysius</HI> Martiall, <HI>Arrianus</HI> war-like. The <HI>Germane</HI> is couragious, fierce at an onser, and desirous of warres, as <HI>Seneca</HI> witnesseth in his booke <HI>de Ira.</HI> Moreover the Coun∣try of <HI>Germany</HI> is now so pleasant, and so adorned with faire Citties, Castells, and Villages, that it is not inferior to <HI>Italie France</HI>
<PB N="523" REF="389"/>
and <HI>Spaine.</HI> There are 84 free Citties in it, as <HI>Colonia Agrippina, Wirtemberg, Lubek, Luneburg, Franckfort, Breme, Lipsick, Spires, Argentine, Friburg, Augusta Vindelicorum, Tubinga, Heidelburg, Ratisbone, Vienna, Prague, Buda, &amp;c.</HI> of which hereafter. <HI>Ger∣many</HI> also is watered with so many great Rivers, beside Lakes and Marishes of which it hath great stoare, that in this respect, also it may compare with the chiefest Countries. <HI>Seneca</HI> in his third booke of naturall questions sheweth the cause why it hath so many Rivers: <HI>At contra, ait, constat Germaniam Galliam{que}, &amp; proxime ab his Italiam abundare Rivis, &amp; fluminibus; quia coelo humido utuntur, &amp; ne aestate quidem, imbribus carent:</HI> That is, But on the contrary (saith he) it is manifest that <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> which is next unto them, have great stoare of Rivers, because they have a moystaye, and have often raine in Summer. But these Rivers of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> are more famous, as <HI>Danubius, Rhene, Amasis, Moenus, Necarus, Albis, Suevus, Visurgis,</HI> and <HI>Vistula.</HI> That which <HI>Ptolomie</HI> and o∣thers doe call <HI>Danubius, Plinny</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> doe call <HI>Ister;</HI> the one saith that it changeth his name neere the Cataracts thereof; the other, where it washeth <HI>Illyrium.

Stephanus</HI> heretofore called it <HI>Matoas:</HI> also <HI>Danu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> and <HI>Danusis: Festus</HI> calleth it <HI>Addubanus.</HI> Ancient coynes doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me it <HI>Daunvius:</HI> it is now called <HI>Done</HI> and <HI>Donaw,</HI> from the noyse and sound of the waters, as <HI>Althamerus</HI> saith. <HI>Salust</HI> writeth that this is the greatest River next to <HI>Nile</HI> which floweth into the <HI>Medi∣terranian</HI> Sea; and <HI>Arrianus, lib.</HI> 1. of the acts of <HI>Alexander,</HI> calleth it the greatest River. It riseth in the wood <HI>Hercynia,</HI> in the village <HI>Den Eschingen,</HI> where it springeth out of the bowells of the Earth. The auncients doe call the Mountaine out of which it riseth <HI>Abno∣ba,</HI> although as <HI>Munster</HI> an eye-witnesse writeth, there is no moun∣taine nere it: but it falleth with a continual running streame, from a lit∣tle hill which is scarse 15 or 16 foote high. He addeth that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had a desire to see the spring head thereof. <HI>Herodotus</HI> beleeved that it rose out of the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountaines, whose opinion <HI>Aristotle</HI> also followed, 2. <HI>Meteorologicor. Maginus</HI> placeth those <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> hills in <HI>Germany,</HI> thereby to excuse the errour of grave writers. As soone as it glideth from the fountaine, it runneth abroad through Moarish pla∣ces, and afterward it gathers it selfe into a Channell, and so being en∣creased by receiving other Rivers, it runneth through many coun∣tries, as <HI>Sucuia, Pannonia, Dacia, Bulgaria,</HI> untill at last having recei∣ved 6 navigable Rivers, it rowleth into the Sea with five streames or mouthes, as <HI>Dionysius, Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> doe mention: <HI>Plinny</HI> saith with sixe, and <HI>Amianus,</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> with seaven: and with such violence, so that it runneth with fresh water 40 miles into the sea. And as <HI>Amian</HI> saith: <HI>Et constat ab ultimis nostri finibus maris, ag∣mina <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m pariendi gratia petere Pisces, ut aquarum suavitate salubrius faetum educant, nec intercipiantur,</HI> That is, it is manifest that the fish from the farthest part of our seas doe come hither in shoales, that
<PB N="524" REF="390"/>
they may spawne here in safety. <HI>Tajanus Nerva</HI> built a curious bridge over this River in <HI>Moesia,</HI> which afterward <HI>Adrian</HI> did demo∣lish, as <HI>Dio Cassius</HI> relateth. Concerning <HI>Danubius, George Fabritius</HI> in a certaine Itinerarie of his writeth thus:
<Q><L>—Ister,</L>
<L>Qui centum populos &amp; magnas alluit urbes,</L>
<L>Euxinum irrumpit bis terno flumine Pontum.</L>
<L>Ister that doth through an hundred Countries glide,</L>
<L>And watereth them, with Citties too beside,</L>
<L>Both faire and great, with sixe streames last of all,</L>
<L>Into the Euxine Sea at length doth fall.</L></Q></P>
<P>For at length all the most famous Rivers in the world do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> runne into the Sea, as <HI>Ovid</HI> also <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Metamorph.</HI> does mention in this verse:
<Q><L>In quo desinimus, sacri, in quo currimus amnes.</L>
<L>We sacred Rivers to the Sea doe come,</L>
<L>And into it we all of us doe runne.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Rhene,</HI> which <HI>Caesar</HI> and other doe commend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is now called <HI>Rhijn.

The one being more to the Northwest which is commonly called the foremost <HI>Rhene</HI> the o∣ther lying more Southeast, which the inhabitants cal the latter <HI>Rhene.</HI> These two at length meete together, and so doe make the River <HI>Rhene,</HI> which neere unto the head doe make two Lakes, the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nian</HI> and <HI>Constantian,</HI> from the Cittie <HI>Constantia</HI> which is situated by it; concerning which we will entreate in the description of <HI>Helvena:</HI> the other is called <HI>Venetum,</HI> and now the <HI>Cellensian</HI> Lake, from the little Towne <HI>Cella,</HI> which Lake hath abundance of all sorts of fish. From hence turning Westward it watereth <HI>Rhinfelden,</HI> &amp; follows the same tract even to <HI>Basilea.</HI> And there it runneth Northward, untill it come to <HI>Argentoratum:</HI> and so watereth many Countries, and having viewed many Citties, and having received many great and small Ri∣vers, it groweth very deepe, and commeth swelling even to <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, Wormes,</HI> and <HI>Moguntiam.</HI> Hence turning Westward it watereth <HI>Bra∣gium.</HI> And from thence winding toward <HI>Caecia,</HI> having left behind it <HI>Bonna</HI> and <HI>Colonia,</HI> at last neere the edge of <HI>Batavia</HI> (which is now under the jurisdiction of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> and is graced with the auncient Castell <HI>Lobecum</HI>) it doth divide it selfe, and with a double streame runneth divers wayes.

Neere there∣fore to <HI>Lobecum</HI> it doth divide his course, so that the one part there∣of called <HI>Rhene</HI> doth run straite forward to <HI>Arenacum</HI> a chiefe Cittie of <HI>Gelderland.</HI> And from thence with many winding <HI>Maeanders,</HI> it glideth towards <HI>Vada;</HI> and so bendeth from thence to <HI>Rhena,</HI> which <HI>Tantus</HI> calleth <HI>Rinnes:</HI> from thence it runneth to <HI>Bavodurum,</HI> After∣ward the <HI>Rhene</HI> changeth his name, and begins to be called <HI>Lecca,</HI> be∣ing heretofore a little Rivulet, but now it is become a River.

especially in the generall description of <HI>Belgia:</HI> we will speake first concerning the tide of the Sea, and afterward we will reckon up the properties of the <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea. It is manifest that the Moone is the cause of the tides of the Ocean. But as the Moone hath divers chan∣ges in her motion, so the tides doe also change. For they following the Moone, doe flow twice betweene the rising thereof, and doe ebbe twice in foure and twentie houres: so that the Seas doe flow twice, and ebbe twice every day: they flow when the Moone ascen∣deth above the Easterne <HI>Horizon,</HI> and do ebb when it declineth from the <HI>Meridian</HI> westward; and it floweth againe when the Moone goeth downe under the earth, and commeth to the contrary part of the <HI>Me∣ridian,</HI> and so likewise it ebbeth untill it rise againe. But as the Moone does not alwayes rise at one time, and in one place, but every day ri∣seth in another place than it did before: so the tides doe not flow at certaine houres, but at that time when the Moone passeth through the Poles of the heavens. Moreover it is to bee noted, that the full Moone doth move the Sea in another manner than the halfe Moone. For this <HI>Luminarie</HI> hath greater force when it is at the full, than when it is weake, and in the waine. We use to call those tides which are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the full of the Moone <HI>Sprinckuloedt,</HI> that is, a Spring-tide. Which <HI>Agel Lib.</HI> 14. concerning the Ocean, doth elegantly call the Moones companion, seeing it followeth the age and increase thereof; and also he noteth some aspects, and configurations: As for example sake, if the Moone have a fit aspect unto <HI>Venus,</HI> and doe run through moist houses, it doth wonderfully increase the tides of the sea: but if it be aspected with <HI>Mars,</HI> or dry Planets, it doth lessen the tides. Here also the ascention of the signes is to be noted. But if the Moon be in signes of a right ascension, it maketh the tides longer than if it were in signes of oblique ascension: for it is observed that the tides are ne∣ver equall to the ebbes in continuance of time; but when the Moone is in the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> signes and hath no Latitude. Besides, some parts of the water doe finde a greater influence proceeding from the beames of the bodie of the Moone, either in regard of the rectitude and straightnesse of the beames, or some other hidden qualitie. But the Moone hath a different influence when it is Northward, and ano∣ther when it is Southward; for when it is heere it encreases the tides on the Southerne shoares, and when it is there, on the Northerne shoa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. Moreover the Tides of the Sea are greater in some places, and in other places very small or none at all. For as concerning this our <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea, it is certaine that there are scarce any tides which can be perceived, but as the Sea is carried with the windes, it soweth now here and now there: for when it is an East wind, the Sea goeth very high, and driveth backe Rivers, neither doth it flow onely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Sea side, but it overflowes the Land. And whereas the Spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h and <HI>Atlanticke</HI> Ocean is of an unsearchable deapth, so that a line of three hundred or foure hundred fathom cannot sound the bottome of it, yet the <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea, in the most parts is but 60. Cubits deepe and never above an hundred Cubits, except on some shoares of <HI>Nor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> which are thought to be of an insearchable depth. Moreover it
<PB N="528" REF="392"/>
is worthy to be mentioned, that whereas all other Seas are bitter and salt, our Sea hath sweete waters and not unpleasant to drinke, and that in regard that many great fresh Rivers doe runne into it out of the <HI>Sarmatian</HI> Mountaines, and because the Sunne is too weake in those places to exhale and draw up the lighter and thinner parts of the water, which some make to bee the chiefe cause of the saltnesse of the Sea. Which reason if it were good and probable, then the <HI>Amalchian</HI> Sea also, and the <HI>Chronian</HI> Sea should not be salt, which is otherwise. Wherefore it is rather to be held that the melted snow, and the aforesayd Rivers flowing downe out of the <HI>Sarmatian</HI> Moun∣taines, doe make this Sea cleere and sweete. Whereby it comes to passe, that other Seas doe more easily carry vessells of great burden, than this. And the reason is because the water of the salt Sea is of a thicker substance, while the thinner waters doe yeeld to the least waight. It is easier also to swim in this Sea than in others. Yet it maketh Sea men more sicke, in regard the waves got very high, so that sometimes they seeme to touch the Clouds, and then fall againe and breake into deepe valleyes. This Sea in divers places, hath di∣vers appellations, or names; For sometimes it is called the <HI>Germaine</HI> Ocean, from <HI>Germanie</HI> which is neere unto it, and it reacheth from the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Brittish</HI> Sea, which lyeth Westward, even to <HI>Sarma∣tia</HI> in the East. It is also called the Northerne Sea, the <HI>Cimbrian</HI> Sea, the <HI>Balthick,</HI> the <HI>Codanian,</HI> the <HI>Suevian</HI> Sea, &amp;c. And so much con∣cerning the Sea.

But of these things enough, I passe to other matters: The publicke and priuate workes doe follow, among which (to passe by others) is the Church at <HI>Argentoratum,</HI> famous for the neate structure and building, having a very high Tower. So that it is the eighth miracle of the world. This Church was founded in the yeare of Christ 1015. But in the yere of our Lord 1277, in the time of the Bishop <HI>Conrade</HI> of <HI>Liechtenberg, Erkuinus</HI> of <HI>Steinbach</HI> an <HI>Architect</HI> began to build the Tower, being a famous worke; so that there is not the like, either in <HI>Germanie, Italy,</HI> or <HI>France;</HI> it was built up to the toppe in seaven and twentie yeeres. It is built even from the foundation to the toppe, of free square stone; it hath many open places to receive the ayre and the winde, and the ascent and going up unto it is by foure staires; but when the bredth of it begins to lessen, and grow sharpe towards the toppe, there are eight staires. The very top of it which below doth scarsely seeme as bigge as a Bushell, is so great, that five or sixe men might stand upon it. The height of it is 574 <HI>Geometricall</HI> feete; there is also a curious and artificiall Clocke. And as concerning the Ecclesiasticke state of <HI>Germanie,</HI> there are 7 Archbishops in the Em∣pire of <HI>Germanie.</HI> These are, the Archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> under whom are 12 Suffragan Bishops, as the Bishop of <HI>Chur,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Co∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tz,</HI> of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> of <HI>Spires,</HI> of <HI>Wormes,</HI> of <HI>Wurtzburg,</HI> of <HI>Ausburg,</HI> of <HI>Arstett,</HI> of <HI>Hildeshaim,</HI> of <HI>Paderborn,</HI> of <HI>Halbert statt,</HI> of <HI>Ferden.</HI> The Archbishop of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olen,</HI> who hath 5 Suffragan Bishops the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Vtretcht,</HI> of <HI>Leodium,</HI> of <HI>Minden,</HI> and of <HI>Osenburg.</HI> Also the Archbishop of <HI>Triers,</HI> under whom are 3 Suffra∣gan bishops; the Bishop of <HI>Metz,</HI> of <HI>Toul</HI> in <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> and the Bi∣shop of <HI>Verdun.</HI> Also the Archbishop of <HI>Meydmurg</HI> Primate of <HI>Ger∣manie,</HI> under whom are foure Bishops; the Bishop of <HI>Morsburg,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Naumburg,</HI> of <HI>Brandeburg,</HI> and <HI>Havelburg.</HI> The Archbi∣shop of <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> hath 9 Suffragan Bishops under him; as the Bishop of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent, Brixiensis,</HI> of <HI>Passaw, Frisingensis,</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> of <HI>Seckaw;</HI> of <HI>Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x,</HI> of <HI>Lavenmund,</HI> and of <HI>Chiemse.</HI> The Archbishop of <HI>Bremes,</HI> under whom there are sixe Suffragan Bishops, as the Bishop of <HI>Lu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke, Suerinensis,</HI> of <HI>Lebus,</HI> of <HI>Schleswicke,</HI> of <HI>Ratzenburg,</HI> and of <HI>Hamburg,</HI> heretofore an Archbishopricke.

Now I come to their manners. All Authors doe report that the <HI>Ger∣maines</HI> are strong, and of a great stature. <HI>Tacitus</HI> saith they are gray eyde, red haird, large bodyed, and very strong. <HI>Hegesippus</HI> and <HI>Plin∣ny</HI> doe call them great men: <HI>Sidonius</HI> calleth them cruell and fierce, <HI>Pausanias</HI> and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiodorus</HI> calleth them proud: <HI>Appianus,</HI> ungentle, <HI>Caesar</HI> calleth them barbarous, treacherous, and dissemblers: <HI>Pater∣culus</HI> saith that they are very crafty, and are naturally given to lye. But <HI>Tacitus</HI> who lived amongst them saith, that the souldiers are very couragious, and that it is a warlike Nation, but are neither cunning nor crafty, but doe discover their owne mindes and secrets, and very faithfull in keeping secrets committed to them. Also the Emperour <HI>Iulianus</HI> in his <HI>Misopogne</HI> saith, that hee knoweth by experience that this Nation cannot flatter, but that they deale freely and plaine∣ly with all men. <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> 11. <HI>Quadrip.</HI> saith, that they must needes be of a quiet and peaceable disposition, in regard of the qualitie of the Countrie which they inhabit. Concerning their religion, where∣by the mindes of men are held and bound together by the tye and feare of some Deity, the <HI>Germaines</HI> (as <HI>Caesar</HI> writeth) doe use no sacri∣fices, they account them onely to be gods whom they see, and from whom they receive some benefit: as the Sunne, and <HI>Vulcan,</HI> and the Moone. But afterward, as it appeareth in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who lived under the reigne of the Emperour <HI>Nerva;</HI> they had many other gods: as <HI>Mercury, Hercules, Mars, Isis,</HI> and <HI>Berecinthia:</HI> also a certaine god called <HI>Alcis.</HI> The same <HI>Tacitus</HI> doth report also that <HI>Velleda</HI> and <HI>Au∣rinia</HI> were accounted as Gods. And the aforesaid <HI>Tacitus</HI> maketh mention of the Temple of <HI>Tanfana,</HI> who saith that the <HI>Suevians</HI> doe reverence the mother Earth, which they call (as <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>psius</HI> saith) <HI>Aer∣tha.</HI> But <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> doe affirme that they had no Images in their Temples, but certaine holy women, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> calleth Soothsayers, and <HI>Agathias,</HI> and <HI>Polyoenus</HI> doe call them Prophetesses, who did foretell future events, by the sound, and courses of Rivers. <HI>Amilianus</HI> doth note, that they doe foretell things to come, by the flight of birds, by the inspection of entralls, and all other signes. But they did chiefely reverence <HI>Mercury</HI> or <HI>Teutates,</HI> and offered humaine sacrifices thereunto, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> wit∣nesseth. In the time of peace there was no common Magistrate, but in the time of warre they did chuse Governours. They spent all their life time in military affaires: and to rob was accounted no disgrace, as we may reade in <HI>Caesar. Seneca</HI> saith, that their chiefe delight was the warres in which they were both borne and bread. If (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> witnesseth) they have peace any long time together at home in their owne Country, then they goe to the warres in other Nations. They cary about with them their mothers, wives, and children, who doe carry their knapsackes, and provision: neither are they afraide of plagues. They joyne battell with songs and warlike sounds. They count it a great disgrace to lose their buckler in the field, so that many after the battle for griefe thereof have hang'd themselves. <HI>Dion</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> do report; that they will march over Rivers in regard they are lightly armed, and of an high stature. We reade in <HI>Appian</HI> that
<PB N="531" REF="393"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey doe contemne death, being perswaded that they shall live a∣gaine hereafter. They observe the rites of matrimony, and are con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent with their owne wives; so that few adulteries are committed; for which they have this present punishment: the woman that is taken in adulterie hath her haire cut off, and then her husband thrusts her out of doores before her kindred, and beates her along the Towne. Thus <HI>Tacitus</HI> reporteth. The Mothers doe nurse their owne chil∣den, and doe not put them forth to Nurses. <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, that they account it unlawfull to wrong a stranger, which commeth unto them upon any occasion, so that they are ready to protect them from all injuries: their houses stand open, and they eate one with another. And here good manners prevaile more, than good lawes in other places. The greatest part of their food, as <HI>Caesar</HI> mentioneth, doth consist in milke, cheese, and flesh. <HI>Plinny</HI> witnesseth that they live by no other graine but Oates; and <HI>Mela</HI> addeth that in times of want they will eate raw flesh. At dinners as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> witnesseth, they have peeces of meate roasted, and they drinke milke and wine. Their fare is homely, as the flesh of wilde beasts, Crabbes, or sowre milke: their drinke is made of Barley and wheate, neither is there any Nation more magnificent in entertainment or in feasting. But as to man or Nation is without some vice, so they count it no shame to drinke night and day. Concerning their habit, <HI>Tacitus</HI> saith that they all weare a kinde of Cloake button'd before, which loosely hangeth over their shoulders: the same <HI>Tacitus</HI> saith, that the <HI>Germaines</HI> did not weare a loose garment but a straite bodyed garment, such as <HI>Si∣donius</HI> saith the <HI>French</HI> did use. The women doe goe in apparell like the men. Heretofore the <HI>Germaines</HI> were strong of body, but rude, and ignorant of Arts. But now they doe make all kinde of excellent manufactures and workes, and most especially they are skilfull in ca∣sting of brasse, and in the knowledge of mettalls. In this Countrie brasse Ordinance and <HI>Printing</HI> were first invented, and the making of Clockes was found out: and lastly, <HI>Germany</HI> is such a Nursery of all Arts, that it doth perfect some, and findeth out other Inventions. Al∣so it transporteth into Countries both neere and remote, the best Wines, Gold, Silver, Coppresse, Tinne, Lead, Quicksilver, Alume, and divers painting colours, also Corne, and divers other commodi∣ties.</P>

<P>But provident nature hath given the <HI>Frieslanders,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> insteed of wood, a certaine kind of turffe, which being digged out of the earth, and dryed in the winde and Sunne, doth burne very well, which is a better fuell than that which the <HI>Scythians</HI> used, who wan∣ting wood did burne bones, and kept fire with them. And there is so great plenty of this turffe, as that it doth not onely serve the inhabi∣tants, but also other neighbour Countries. There are diverse kindes of it, which doe differ in colour, lightnesse, and the whitenesse of their ashes. There is one bad, light, and spongie kinde of turffe, of a Mosse colour, which is of no esteeme for use: which in burning ma∣keth those that stand by, as pale as Lead, and to looke like Ghosts, the smell whereof doth cause many to swound; but a little salt sprin∣kled on it taketh it away. The other is thicker, and fuller of seggs, and waightier, and serveth for divers uses. The third kinde is as hard as a bricke, and whereas the other swim in the water this sinketh; it is hard to take fire, but being once kindled it keepeth fire a long time; it is of an ash colour, and is digged on a Moorish ground. In <HI>Zeland</HI> also there is a kinde of turffe made of Moorish earth, which they call <HI>Daria.</HI> Also the Countrie people of <HI>Friesland,</HI> have a certaine kinde of turffe made of mud, tempered and mingled with straw, reedes, and hay, and afterward dryed in the Sunne; but the smoake thereof is very troublesome for the eyes. This Country of <HI>Friesland</HI> was heretofore a Kingdome, even to the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, after whose decease it was troubled, although before it was subject to the government of <HI>Denmarke</HI> and <HI>Norway.</HI> But at length it enjoy∣ed some <HI>Halcyon</HI> dayes of quiet, under the reigne of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, who was a peaceable prince. There are 12 Citties in <HI>Friesland. Leuwarden</HI> is the Metropolis of all <HI>Friesland,</HI> and a rich Cittie, which as it is adorned &amp; beautified with many private houses, so it is strongly fortified with a Castle &amp; rampires against the assaults of enemies. The Court of Iudgement, and the Chancery for all <HI>Fries∣land</HI> is kept heere, from whence there is no appeale.

It was a Cittie about 200 yeeres agoe, but in processe of time it grew so great, so that it is now equall to any Cittie in <HI>Friesland.</HI> It hath produced many good wittes: <HI>Ioachim Hopper</HI> was borne and bred in it, who was not onely a light and Ornament to this Cittie, but also to all <HI>Friesland,</HI> and the Low Countries. Also <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Frite∣ma</HI> a Lawyer, and <HI>Albertus Hero,</HI> a Philosopher and Divine were borne here, and many other learned men. <HI>Staveren</HI> is situate on the

This Cittie hath no magnificent building in it, but a strong Castell which standeth over the haven, which was founded by <HI>George Schencke,</HI> Governour of <HI>Friesland,</HI> in <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth's name, in the yeere 1522, that so the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> might con∣veniently send thither souldies, and provision for the warre, out of the neighbour Citties of <HI>Holland.

The greater are those that doe inhabit the Bishopricke of <HI>Bremes:</HI> the lesser are the <HI>Embdanians</HI> and <HI>Oldenburgians.</HI> Forasmuch as <HI>Pto∣lomie</HI> seateth them betweene the River <HI>Amisis,</HI> and <HI>Visurgie</HI> his words are these: They saw also in the North, the Nation of the <HI>Chaucians,</HI> who are called the greater, and the lesser, where the Sea floweth up every day and night, so that it is doubtfull whether it be Land or Sea. Where the miserable people do get upon high hils, and their cottages do flote when the Sea commeth in, and doe seeme like shipwrackes, when it ebbeth backe againe. They have no Cattell nor milke as their neighbours have, nor can they kill any wildebeasts because there is no shrubbes, nor harbour for them. They make thred of Bulrushes and reedes, to weave fishing Netts, and so making a fire with a little dryed mud, they boyle their meate, and warme themselves. Their drinke is raine water which they keepe in tren∣ches before their houses. In this manner the <HI>Chaucians</HI> lived heretofore. But now they are much changed, for now the Countrie doth afford foode not onely for the inhabitants, but also for the neighbour Countries.

For nature hath given them a champion Coun∣try, full of faire Meddowes, being of a fat soyle, and having many pleasant pastures, which are well replenished and stoared with innu∣merable flockes, and heards of Cattell. Which appeareth by that wonderfull great plenty of excellent good Butter and Cheese, which is made here, which to the great gaine and benefit of the inhabitants
<PB N="537" REF="397"/>
is transported to divers Countries, and through all <HI>Germanie.</HI> Also the fertilitie of this Countrie appeareth by the fat and great Ox∣en, which many thousands doe graze within the Meddowes, and doe grow so fat, that forraine Nations doe much esteeme of them. Be∣sides heere is excellent hunting. So that this Countrie is now of so rich a soyle, that it needeth no supply from neighbour Countries; for it hath such stoare of horses, Oxen, Cattell, Hogges, Wooll, Better, Cheese, Barly, Oates, Wheate, Beanes, Pease, and Salt, so that it doth yeerely transport great plentie thereof to the Countries round about it, and those which are more remote. Moreover the Emperour <HI>Fredericke</HI> the third, <HI>Anno</HI> 1465, when this province was governed by divers Praefects, did make it a Countie, and gave it to one <HI>Vdalrich.</HI> Afterward it had Earles continually even untill our time. There are two walled Citties in that Countie, <HI>Embda</HI> and <HI>Arichum. Embda</HI> or <HI>Embdena,</HI> commonly called <HI>Embden,</HI> is the chiefe Cittie of this Countrie, and a famous Mart Towne, seated by the mouth of the River <HI>Amisis,</HI> having a convenient Haven, the Channell whereof is so deepe, that great ships may come in under sayle: so that for wealth, for the publicke and private building, and for the multitude of Cittizens, it is known not onely in <HI>Germanie</HI> but also in all parts of <HI>Europe</HI> One of the chiefest Ornaments is the Earles sumptuous pallace, the great Church, and the Praetors house. Heere is wonderfull plenty of all things, both for necessity and plea∣sure, which the Haven, and the conveniencie of importation of goods, and also the naturall fertilitie of <HI>Friesland</HI> doth yeeld. The Cittie is so called from the River <HI>Ems,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> calleth <HI>Ami∣sia.</HI> The other Cittie is <HI>Aurichum,</HI> which is a pleasant retiring place for the Nobilitie, in regard of Woods and Forrests, in which they doe freely recreate themselves, with Hawking and hunting. The Cittizens are rich, and doe give themselves either to merchandise or some mechanicke trade. There are an infinite many of Castells and Townes in this Countie. And such a number of Villages, that one doth even joyne upon another. The most whereof both for faire houses, large streets, and populousnesse, may compare with some Citties of <HI>Germanie.</HI> Neither doe rusticke people or husbandmen onely live in them, but also Merchants, and divers kinds of artificers and some of the Nobility: There are also two other Counties which are subject to the Earle of <HI>Embda, Esensis,</HI> and <HI>Ieverensis,</HI> so called from their chiefe townes: the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trie <HI>Ieverensis</HI> is situated beyond the River <HI>Iada</HI> Westward, and doth containe eighteene Villages.

The Cittie of <HI>Munster</HI> nameth the whole Bishopricke, which was so called of a fa∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s monastery built there. See <HI>Munster Lib.</HI> 3. of his <HI>Cosmogra∣pha.</HI> Heere began the faction of the Anabaptists, in the yeere of our Lord 1533, so that all of that sect did repaire hither, where they chose one <HI>Iohn Buckholdus</HI> a Cobler to bee the head and ringleader of this sedition, a Vulgar fellow, fit, for any attempt, and farre excelling all the rest, both for wit, boldnesse, eloquence, and cunning. Hee did not feare to stile himselfe King of <HI>Munster.</HI> Whereupon the Bishoppe thought it meete to suppresse this sect, and so being ayded and helped by the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Colen</HI> and also the Duke of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> after foureteene m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eths seige hee obtained his Cittie.

<P><HI>Susatum</HI> or <HI>Soest</HI> is the richest and fairest Cittie next to <HI>Mun∣ster,</HI> having tenne great Parishes. They report themselves, that it whas but a Castell at the first, but afterward by degrees it became a very great Cittie. And from thence it was there called <HI>Susatum,</HI> because in regard of the convenient situation, houses were built by the Castell, so that from the dayly increase thereof it was called <HI>Sutatum,</HI> as it were <HI>ein Zusatz.</HI> It hath also ma∣ny neighbouring Villages which are subject to it, which they commonly call <HI>Die Burden.</HI> This Cittie is now under the Duke of <HI>Clevelands</HI> protection, but before it was subject to the Bishop of <HI>Colen. Wesel</HI> is a faire rich Cittie, famous for traffique and Mer∣chandising.

Others doe suppose that this Cittie was begun by <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> as the <HI>Saxons</HI> An∣nalls doe mention. They report that it was so named from the Oxe∣hides, with which this Cittie was encompassed. It is situated in a pleasant Valley, and it is watered with the River <HI>Hasa;</HI> they brew good fat drinke in it, which they call Buse. <HI>Charles</HI> the Great when after 30 yeares warres hee had conquered the <HI>Saxons;</HI> and had tooke the Castell of <HI>Widekind</HI> which was neere unto this Cittie, and had put a strong garrison in it, hee instituted twelve Bishoprickes in <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and made the Bishopricke of <HI>Osnaburg</HI> the chiefest. For hee esteemed this Cittie above all the rest, and granted them the priviledge of a free Schoole, for the teaching of the Greeke and Latine tongues; as <HI>Munster, Hamelmann,</HI> and the Chronicles of <HI>Argentine</HI> doe also mention. <HI>Minda</HI> common∣ly called <HI>Minden,</HI> is a pleasant strong Cittie, and the River <HI>Visurgis</HI> yeeldeth it great store of fish, and bringeth up many commodities unto it: it breweth good drinke, which is much esteemed, and venteth great store of commodities by way of traffique. Concerning the beginning hereof <HI>Munster</HI> writeth thus: When <HI>Wildekindus,</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> was conver∣ted to the Christian faith; hee gave the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> his Castell neere the River <HI>Wesera,</HI> on condition that the Bishoppe should have part of it, for it was able to receive them both, so that the Bishop might say, This Castle shall bee mine and thine for both of us have right unto it; and from hence it was so called in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Language <HI>Myndyn.</HI> But in the processe of time the letty <HI>y</HI> was changed into an <HI>e,</HI> and now that same Cittie is cal∣led <HI>Mynden.</HI></P>

was afterward builded, there were heretofore two Villages; namely the old and new. But when <HI>Charles</HI> the Great had subdued all these Provinces of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> it became a free Towne. For he having considered the fruitfulnesse of the soyle, and the excellencie of the Situation, brought his Colonies hither, and kept his Court here.

I passe by the other Churches, Monasteries, Hospitalls for the sicke, and the guest-houses which are in <HI>Munster</HI> and in other Citties. <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, as we sayd before, did enforce the <HI>Westphalians</HI> to receive the Christian Religion. But seeing that after they had beene many times subdued, they were yet stubborne and refractory, and did violate the oath which they had taken, he thought it meete to chastise their insolencie, by punishing some, to the feare and ter∣ror of others. Therefore he constituted certaine Iudges, and gave them power to examine and punish perjur'd persons or rash swea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, or those that were guilty of any fact, without hearing them, or ad∣mitting any plea in their owne defence. This sharpe severitie made the <HI>Westphalians</HI> both fruitfull and obedient, when they saw that Noblemen, and men of great estates, were hang'd up in the Woods by Martiall law, without any triall. <HI>Aeneas Pius</HI> writeth, that this kinde of Iudgement did continew even untill his time, and that the secret rites, were observed, by which they judge delinquents, and offenders, and doe punish the guilty wheresoever they are found,
<PB N="551" REF="406"/>
before they know that they are condemned, and the Iudges are cal∣led <HI>Scabini:</HI> but so much hitherto. <HI>Iohn Lewenclavius</HI> a learned man and skilfull in the Latine and Greeke tongues, was borne in <HI>Westpha∣lia,</HI> who most happily translated all <HI>Xenophon,</HI> all <HI>Nazianzenus</HI> workes, and some Greeke historians, and other Greeke bookes, to his everlasting fame and renowne. The people of this Country are comely and handsome, of a large stature, strong limmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manners</NOTE> and very hardy and couragious. It hath plentie of Souldiers, so that they can presently raise an armie. The Inhabitants also are witty, and it is a proverbe, that there are more craftie knaves in <HI>Westphalia</HI> than fooles. They punish adulterie with much severitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Dyet.</NOTE> Their food is blacke bread and cheese: their flesh meate is Porke, hung Beefe, and Bacon, of which they have great store: Especially the Gammons which the inhabitants doe eate raw.

up many Goates and Kiddes in these woods, in regard that they de∣light more in wooddy Forrests than in Meddowes. For <HI>Caprae</HI> or Goates are so called <HI>à Carpendo,</HI> that is, from cropping of trees, and therefore it was wont to be a clause of exception in letting of ground, that no Farmer should keepe Goates in his ground. Neere <HI>Heydel∣burg</HI> there is great storne of Hearnes, which breed there in the Woods: there is also a kinde of water Fowle, which liveth in the water, and yet cannot endure any raine or tempests, which she avoy∣deth by flying high in the ayre, according to that of <HI>Virgill:</HI>
<Q><LG>
<L>Atque altam supra volat Ardea nubem,</L>
</LG><LG>
<L>And the long-wing'd Herne doth fly</L>
<L>Above the clouds that are so hie.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>It is called also <HI>Ardea, quod ardua suo volatu petat,</HI> that is, be∣cause it flyeth high. She buildeth her nest in the highest trees, and doth naturally hate the Hawke, as likewise the Hawke seeketh con∣tinually her destruction. But when they fight in the ayre, they both strive which should get uppermost; if the Hawke be above her, he comes downe upon her with great violence, and kills her. But to the matter. There were alwayes Praefects of the Pallace, especially in the Emperours Court, which the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> did heretofore call the Majors, of the house or Pallace. But at what time the Countie <HI>Pa∣latine</HI> of <HI>Rhene</HI> was instituted, and where the <HI>Palatines</HI> of <HI>Rhene</HI> did keepe their residence foure hundred or five hundred yeares agoe, I cannot determine, seeing there are divers different conjectures. Some say the first <HI>Palatines,</HI> were onely Noble men untill the time of <HI>Otto</HI> the third, at what time they were made Princes Electors: for they had more dignity. The first Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> was <HI>Henry,</HI> who with the other Electors in the yeare 1003 did chuse the Em∣perour <HI>Henry.</HI> But <HI>Munster</HI> saith that he doth not finde it mentioned in any writings, either where he kept his Court, or what Country he governed, or what people were subject unto him; but some doe suppose, but without any certaine ground, that the Princes <HI>Palatine</HI> did heretofore keepe their residence at <HI>Wormacia,</HI> and had great power in that Citie. It is manifest, that <HI>Conradus</HI> Duke of <HI>Franconiae</HI> in the yeere 742 did reside at <HI>Wormes,</HI> but not the Prince <HI>Palatine.</HI> This was the seate heretofore of the <HI>Intuergians,</HI> the <HI>Nemetians,</HI> and the <HI>Vangionians,</HI> as some doe suppose. The <HI>Intrergians</HI> were a peo∣ple of <HI>Germanie,</HI> which <HI>Peucerus</HI> doth place in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> neere to <HI>Heydelberg,</HI> which Country was also called <HI>Capellatium</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> as we sayd before. Those whom <HI>Ptolomie</HI> and others call the <HI>Ne∣metians,</HI> were a people in <HI>Germanie</HI> neere the <HI>Rhene,</HI> confining on the <HI>Metensians, Argentimentians,</HI> and <HI>Wormacensians; Rhenanus</HI> calleth it now the <HI>Episcopall</HI> Cittie of <HI>Spires,</HI> and <HI>Aethicus</HI> calleth it <HI>Augusta Nemetum.</HI> Also those whom <HI>Ptolomie</HI> calleth <HI>Vangiones,</HI> are a peo∣ple of <HI>Germanie,</HI> neere the <HI>Rhene: Rhenanus</HI> and <HI>Lichtenavius</HI> doe call them <HI>Wormbser-Bisthumbs.</HI> But <HI>Pirchaymerus</HI> on the contrary af∣firmeth that the <HI>Vangionians</HI> are those of <HI>Spires,</HI> and the <HI>Nemetians</HI>
<PB N="583" REF="429"/>
those of <HI>Wormes;</HI> and <HI>Irenicus</HI> addeth this reason, namely because <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> who in description of <HI>Rhene,</HI> did usually proceede from the South Northward, doth first mention the <HI>Vangians,</HI> and afterward the <HI>Numetians.</HI> But <HI>Sig.

It was so called either from the people, whom the <HI>Germaines</HI> call <HI>Heyden;</HI> or from the Mirtle-tree, which they call <HI>Heydelbeer,</HI> and heereupon the most learned <HI>Melissus</HI> doth call this Citty <HI>Myrtilletum.</HI> That which <HI>Pyramius</HI> calleth <HI>Durla∣cum,</HI> others more rightly doe call <HI>Durlach.

For <HI>Ptolemie</HI> placed <HI>Beudoris;</HI> in the 51 degres of Latitude; when as <HI>Heidel∣berg,</HI> is in the 49 degree, and 35 minutes of Latitude.

It is situate by the River <HI>Nicrus</HI> or <HI>Neicarus,</HI> in the entrance of the Mountaines, it hath beene a famous Vniversity for learning and Arts from the yeare 1356, being then instituted by <HI>Rupert</HI> the elder, Prince <HI>Palatine,</HI> who sent for one <HI>Marsilus</HI> from <HI>Paris</HI> to be governour thereof.

<P>But the learned <HI>Capino</HI> doth derive it from the <HI>Phrygians:</HI> Let every one take which of these coniectures hee pleaseth, for I doe not pur∣pose to refute their opinions.

Moreover albe∣it <HI>Saxonie</HI> is the greatest Countrie in all <HI>Germanie,</HI> yet it is not now so large as it was heretofore. For auncient <HI>Saxonie</HI> was extended be∣tweene the Rivers <HI>Albis</HI> and <HI>Rhene,</HI> the <HI>Germaine</HI> Sea, and the River <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dera,</HI> even to <HI>Hassia</HI> and the confines of <HI>Turingia,</HI> and <HI>Brunswick</HI> was the Center of it: and so also <HI>Westphalia, Marchia Vetus, Misnia, Lusa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, Mansfield,</HI> and many other Countries were called <HI>Saxonie.</HI> Now it is not bounded with such naturall limits, as Rivers and Mountaines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at with the consining dominion of others Principalities. The ayre of this Country is dry, pure, and wholesome, except the marshes doe moysten it too much. <HI>Saxonie</HI> hath abundance of all things, except Wine.

It hath divers kindes of mettalls, especially in the Mountaine <HI>Melibocus,</HI> which reacheth from

The Inhabitants of this Cittie are divided after the <HI>Romane</HI> manner, into Cittizens, Patri∣cians or Senators, and Plebeians. It flourisheth for Politicke govern∣ment, learning, justice, peace, and concord betweene the Clergie, and the Governours of the commonwealth, amongst whom the Patrici∣ans have the chiefest power. I passe by the other Townes for brevitie sake, because I intend to speake something concerning the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburg.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> was heretofore a part of a Province belonging to the King of <HI>Vandalia,</HI> lying neere unto the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, but now it is one of the chiefe Dukedomes of <HI>Germanie</HI> and a member of the Empire: it hath on the East <HI>Pomerania:</HI> on the West the River com∣monly called <HI>de Elve:</HI> on the South it hath the auncient <HI>Marca:</HI> on the North, the <HI>Balticke</HI> Sea. It is a very fruitfull Country, abounding with Wheate, Apples, Wood, and Fish. There are also divers sorts of living creatures, and great store of Oxen and Cattell, and wilde beasts. Moreover <HI>Aritbert</HI> being descended of the royall stocke, and ha∣ving lived some while in <HI>Charles</HI> the Greats Court, marryed the Empe∣rours sister, by whom he had <HI>Billingus,</HI> a man powerfull yet milde and mercifull, whom the <HI>Sarmatians</HI> and <HI>Vandalls,</HI> even from <HI>Vistula</HI> to <HI>Vi∣surgis,</HI> and from <HI>Odera</HI> to <HI>Holsatia</HI> did obey; he had his Pallace at <HI>Mec∣kelburg.</HI> But his two sonnes <HI>Mizilaus</HI> and <HI>Mislevus</HI> degenerating from their fathers piety and goodnesse, began to persecute the Christians. But concerning these and other Princes of <HI>Meckelburg</HI> you may reade <HI>Munster.</HI> The first inhabitants of this Country, Au∣thors doe call <HI>Herulians</HI> or <HI>Obotritians,</HI> and by a generall word <HI>Vanda∣lians.</HI> It is a Country well replenished with citties, townes, castles, and villages. In this Dukedome there is the auncient cittie <HI>Surinum,</HI> which was built before <HI>Lubecke, Sundius,</HI> and <HI>Wismaria.</HI> The figure thereof is fouresquare, and so as if it were foure citties, it hath foure names. The first is called <HI>Senerinus,</HI> the second <HI>Neapolis,</HI> the third is named from the <HI>Cataract,</HI> the fourth from the Marshes. The Village <HI>Fichela</HI> which standeth by the Lake <HI>Suerinus,</HI> is but 5 miles distant from the <HI>Bal∣ticke</HI> Sea: the vicinitie whereof made them bestow much labour in vaine to make a ditch out of the Lake into the <HI>Balticke</HI> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as in like manner there was an attempt made, to cut through the <HI>Pelopennesian Isthmus. Rostochium</HI> commonly called <HI>Rostocke,</HI> and heretofore <HI>Laci∣nium,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Rhodopholis</HI> and <HI>Laciburg,</HI> is a sea cittie: it was first a castle, after, <HI>Godscall</HI> the sonne of <HI>Endo</HI> did change it into a cittie; and afterward it was enlarged by <HI>Prim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slaus</HI> the second the sonne of <HI>Nico∣lottus.</HI> It hath now a flourishing Vniversitie, which the Princes of <HI>Meckelburg</HI> did erect and constitute in the yeere 1415. The ayre here is wholesome, and there is great plenty of provision for food, and very cheape. There is also <HI>Wismaria,</HI> which some imagine was so called from <HI>Wismarus</HI> King of the <HI>Vandalls,</HI> in the flourishing reigne of <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> the Great: some doe affirme, that a <HI>Colonie</HI> of the <HI>Gothes</HI> was brought thither out of <HI>Visbina,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Gothland.</HI> But <HI>Crantzius</HI> Antiquities, and Charters of the commonwealth, dated

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter the yeare 1250, doe shew that it was built before the yeare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>40, out of the ruines of the great auncient Cittie <HI>Mecklenburg,</HI> which gave the name to the whole Countrie, by <HI>Gunzelinus,</HI> Earle of <HI>Suerinus.</HI> But in a short time, this Cittie did wonderfully en∣crease by the traffike and trading of other Nations, having a conve∣nient Haven on the Balticke shore, to receive shippes of great bur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a, where they may lye safely without letting fall any anchors: whence it is likely that the Cittie was named, from the safety and conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance of the Haven. It is compassed round about with small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nes; who doe bring plentie of provision thither, and doe fur∣nish themselves againe from thence: Moreover this ninth circle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Empire called <HI>Nider Saxon,</HI> doth consist of three orders, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whereof is the Clergie, the second are the Princes and Secular Lords, the third are the free Citties.

round about this Cittie is very fruitefull, having pleasant Meddowes, and great store of the hearbe <HI>Isatis. Henry</HI> the fourth did much impo∣verish this Cittie by laying a taxation of Tenthes upon it, having al∣waies enjoyed a freedome &amp; immunitie from such impositions. So that when the <HI>Saxon</HI> warre began, they chose rather to defend their aunci∣ent libertie with the sword, than to submit unto the Vniversall taxation of Tenthes; and that with so great courage, that they brought <HI>Augustus</HI> to a great straite. This Cittie as if fortune an enemie to greatnesse, meant to triumph over it, was of∣tentimes burnt, so that no other great Cittie in <HI>Germany,</HI> was ever burnt so often as this: the last time that it was burnt, which was in the yeare 1472, it sustained much losse, especially in the Churches of the Virgin <HI>Marie</HI> and <HI>Severus,</HI> so that a third part almost of the Cittie was burned downe. This was a terrible fire, which began by some that were hi∣red to set it on fire, of whom the chiefe was a Dominican. Two Col∣legiate Churches, as they call them, together with the Bridge, and a great part of the Cittie were all burnt downe. In the yeare of our Lord 1509 there arose a greivous sedition betweene the Senate and the Cit∣tizens of <HI>Erford,</HI> occasioned by those unusuall impositions which the Senate laid upon the Common people. For the Commons ga∣thering together, would needes know how much the Cittie was in∣debted. The Senate giving way to the tumultuous furie of the peo¦ple, endeavoured to appease them with faire and gentle words, telling them, that in convenient time they would bring in an account of their receipts and expenses; which words quieted the Cittizens for a while. But when the day appointed came, they assembled themselves together, and desired the Senate to bring in their account. But then one more insolent than the rest, spoke sharpely unto those whom the Cittizens had sent to the Senate, which did much provoke and exas∣perate the Cittizens. And when the Cittizens saw that they prevai∣led nothing, but were put off with delayes: they put downe the Se∣nate and chose a new. In briefe, from hence there arose a grievous se∣dition, contention and warre. But the Bishop of <HI>Herbipolis,</HI> and the Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> endeavoured to appease this sedition, and to bring them to concord and agreement. <HI>Weimara</HI> is a faire Towne, ha∣ving formerly a Countie belonging unto it, but now the Dukes of <HI>Sax∣onie</HI> keepe their Court in it, having a faire Pallace there, neately built of square freestone, and an Orchard curiously planted with all kind of trees, and watered with the River <HI>Ilma,</HI> which doth runne at length into <HI>Sala.</HI> There is also the Cittie <HI>Iena,</HI> so called from <HI>Ianus:</HI> but hee was not worshipped in <HI>Germanie.</HI> And therefore <HI>Stigellius</HI> singeth more probably.</P>

And then <HI>Grunbachius,</HI> with foure more of the conspirators, for their treason against <HI>Caesar</HI> were put to death, the Castle was razed to the ground, and Duke <HI>Iohn Fredericke,</HI> was brought prisoner to <HI>Vienna.</HI> This Countrie is watered with many Rivers: as <HI>Sala</HI> or <HI>Salza, Werra, Vnstrut, Ilma, Ge∣ro, Or, Apfelstet, Helbe,</HI> and <HI>Cling.</HI> And <HI>Her</HI> testifieth that the Moun∣taines have mines, which have rich Veines of gold and silver, which are found not far from <HI>Braitenborn,</HI> and <HI>Schwartzenburg.</HI> This Countrie also is here and there cloathed with woods, which are part of the wood <HI>Hercynia:</HI> also the <HI>Thuringian</HI> wood is well knowne, common∣ly called <HI>Thuringer Waldt, Caesar</HI> calleth it <HI>Baceins,</HI> it is a wood in <HI>Ger∣manie</HI> which divideth the <HI>Cheruscians</HI> from the <HI>Suevians;</HI> there are also <HI>Hainich, Hainsette,</HI> and <HI>Finne</HI> with divers others, where there is good hunting of divers kindes of wilde beasts.

It is manifest that the <HI>Germanes</HI> were originally and aunciently called <HI>Germanes</HI> as appeares by others writings, as also out of <HI>Procopius Caesariensis,</HI> who was a sharpe sighted and judicious writer.

Being come into the Cittie he alighteth from his horse, and having put off his richest roabe, foure Earles doe bring him into our Saviours Church, or house, bare headed, and barefooted, in a poore weede or habit, girt about with a little cord. The officiall Earles are the Lords of <HI>Hennenbergh, Castel, Werthein,</HI> and <HI>Reineck.</HI> Then the Deane together with the Clergie go∣eth forth to meete him, and asketh him what he seekes? or what hee
<PB N="545" REF="458"/>
desireth? And then he answereth very submissively, That though unworthy he is now ready to take upon him that office, unto which he was chosen, and to discharge it faithfully. Then the Deane saith; In the name of the Chapter I doe here commit unto thy charge the house of the Saviour of the world, and the Dukedome annexed to it, in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. Af∣terward he followeth the Clergie into our Saviours house, and ha∣ving put on the Pontificall roabe, he first heares Masse, and after∣ward hath a banket, but first the body of the Bishop deceased is em∣boweld and set downe in the Chappell of the Castle: and his heart being tooke out is put in a glasse vessell. The next day he is brought out of the Castle into Saint <HI>Iames</HI> his Monasterie, holding in his right hand a Crozier, and in his left a sword; the third day they goe a∣gaine to our Saviours house, where after Dirges and prayer, he is at last buried with a Crozier and a sword. The other Citties are that which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> calls <HI>Bamberg; Peter Appianus</HI> calleth it <HI>Graniona∣tium,</HI> and <HI>Granionarion</HI> in a Greeke booke: it was at first called <HI>Ba∣lemberg,</HI> that is, the Mountaine of <HI>Baba,</HI> from <HI>Baba</HI> the daughter of <HI>Otto</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and wife to <HI>Albert</HI> Earle of <HI>Babemberg:</HI> others doe call this Cittie <HI>Pfawenberg;</HI> it is a very pleasant Cittie, situated by the River <HI>Regnuz.</HI> It hath many Mountaines, Hills, and Gardens, and a very fruitfull soyle, where great store of Musmillians and Liquerize doe grow. It is an Episcopall Seate; and as it hath bread many happy wits, so it glorieth chiefely in <HI>Ioachim Camerarius</HI> a man famous for all kind of learning, as appeareth by his workes set out by him, which are read with much admiration. There is also <HI>Fran∣cefort,</HI> or <HI>Francoford,</HI> by the River <HI>Moene,</HI> which is commonly called <HI>Franck Furtam Mayn,</HI> to distinguish it from the other <HI>Franckofort</HI> which is situated by <HI>Odera. Munster</HI> writeth that it was heretofore called <HI>Helenopolis,</HI> but he doth not shew when or from whence it was so called. <HI>Henry Stephanus</HI> calleth it in his <HI>Emconion</HI> of this Cit∣tie, the <HI>Academie</HI> of the Muses, the <HI>Athens</HI> of <HI>Franckford,</HI> the Mu∣ses <HI>Mercuriall</HI> Faires, and the Compendium or Epitome of all the Marts of the world. This Cittie is divided into two parts by the Ri∣ver <HI>Moenus,</HI> and joyned together againe with a stone Bridge. It is now an Emperiall Cittie, and famous through the whole world for two Marts or Faires. Heere the Electors doe chuse the <HI>Romaine</HI> Em∣perours, and if there be competitors that stand for the Empire, they doe here fight for it, and try it by battell. There is also <HI>Moguntia</HI> commonly called <HI>Mentz,</HI> some call it <HI>Moguntiacum. Ptolomie Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 8. <HI>tab.</HI> 3. calls it <HI>Neomagum.

It hath a fruitefull soyle on either side of the River <HI>Rhene,</HI> which yeeldeth great store of wine. It is large and well fortified, and very populous on that side which is toward <HI>Rhene:</HI> but on the other side it hath few inhabitants; it is very long but narrow There are faire houses built after the <HI>Romane</HI> fashion, and magnificent Collegiate Churches, with the Bishops Castle.

it is thought that the Art of <HI>Printing</HI> was invented here. It is subject to the Archbishop who is elector, and Chanceller of the Empire. There is also <HI>Mons Regius</HI> commonly called <HI>Conigsperg,</HI> where <HI>Iohn de Monte Regio,</HI> a great Mathematician was borne, whose Commen∣taries upon <HI>Ptolomies Almagest</HI> are yet extant. <HI>Schweinfordia</HI> is situa∣ted by the River <HI>Moene</HI> in the middle almost of <HI>Franconia.</HI> There are also <HI>Kitzinga,</HI> and <HI>Fridberg</HI> an Imperiall Cittie, and others.

Neere to <HI>Kelheime</HI> there are many Vines growing on the bancke of <HI>Danubius.</HI> But they yeeld a kind of hard sharpe Wine, so that it is a common saying that Vinegar growes on those Mountaines. In other places also it produces divers kindes of mettalls, especially great store of Iron, of which the <HI>Nortgovians</HI> doe yearely make a great gaine and commoditie. There is also an excellent kinde of blew colour, which they call <HI>Lazurus.</HI> Moreover <HI>Noricum,</HI> which is now the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> was heretofore a Kingdome, and had Kings of its owne, when the <HI>Romanes</HI> had reduc'd the other part of <HI>Bavaria</HI> into a Pro∣vince even till the yeare of our Lord 500: whence <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> in his Commentaries, mentioneth that <HI>Arivov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stus</HI> King of <HI>Ger∣manie,</HI> married the King of <HI>Noricums</HI> Sister. But what Princes the <HI>Noricians</HI> had afterward doth not appeare, untill they became Christi∣ans. But in the yeare 511, by the labour and industrie of <HI>Theoden</HI> the second, <HI>Bavaria</HI> was reduc'd into one Kingdome, who made a great slaughter on the <HI>Romanes</HI> and drove them out of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> afterward it was divided into three Dukedomes by his three sonnes: <HI>Theedon</HI> the third who was seated at <HI>Ratisbon, Otto</HI> et <HI>Otingis,</HI> and <HI>Theobald</HI> at <HI>Tyrolis.</HI> It would be too long to reckon up the other Princes. But at length the Emperour <HI>Ludovicke</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in the yeare of Christ 1439, did divide it in this manner, that the whole <HI>Norican Bavaria</HI> should belong to the Prince <HI>Palatines,</HI> except some Emperiall Citties, and whatsoever formerly appertained to the Empire. The Metropolis of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is commonly called <HI>Nurenberg,</HI> which is pleasantly seated by the River <HI>Pegnitius,</HI> which watereth the Cittie, it is very large and beautifull, and hath many faire Churches, curious buildings, great streetes, being fortified with strong walls, Towers, and Bulwarkes; and full of Cittizens, rich in Merchandise and famous through the whole world for <HI>Mechanick</HI> Arts: it is situated not only on the Navel as it were or middle of <HI>Germanie,</HI> but also of <HI>Europe;</HI> it is 500 miles di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tant from <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Though the Cittie be of no great antiquitie, yet the Ca∣stle which is situate on a high hill, which was heretofore called <HI>Ca∣strum Nuricum,</HI> is very auncient being built by the Emperour <HI>Claudius Tiberius,</HI> whence it was called <HI>Neroes</HI> Castell. Heretofore it was sub∣ject to <HI>Albert</HI> Duke of <HI>Franconia,</HI> after whose decease it came to the Empire in the reigne of the Emperour <HI>Ludovicke</HI> the third, and after∣ward it increased and began to grow very populous. In the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth it was walled about: and againe in the yeare 1538. Now it is the fairest and largest Cittie in all <HI>Germanie,</HI> so that it hath 128 streetes▪ 11 stone Bridges, which doe conjoyne and unite the two parts of the Cittie. The River <HI>Flavius</HI> passing through the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttie doth drive 68 water-mills. There are also in this Cittie 116 wells, and 12 Conduites, 6 great gates, and 13 common bathes.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1575, the <HI>Noribergians</HI> did institute an Academie or Vniversitie at <HI>Altorsium,</HI> and drew thither with great stipends and

Iul.</HI> which day is sacred to the Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul:</HI> and in the yeare from the birth of our Saviour Christ 1575. This tract of Land hath many o∣ther Townes besides this Metropolis, as also divers monasteries and Villages, one of the chiefest Townes is <HI>Amberg,</HI> which was walled about in the yeare of Christ 1030, also <HI>Auwerback, Sultback,</HI> and the Monasterie of <HI>Castel,</HI> where the Princes of <HI>Nortgow</HI> did formerly keepe their Court: also the Townes <HI>Eger, Beierut, Eistet, Napurg, Newenstadt, Ruwenkelm, Kemnat, Krusen, Grewenwerdt,</HI> and the Ca∣stell <HI>Gainum</HI> which is so called from wayling or Lamenting. For heere <HI>Danubius</HI> passeth by dangerous fearefull places, which make the Marriners cry out when they passe by it; in the <HI>Germane</HI> Lan∣guage it is called <HI>Die Strudel</HI> from the noyse and violence of the wa∣ters: there are also the Townes, <HI>Eschenback, Weiden, Parnaw, Plei∣stein, Herspruck, Rurbaock, Neumarkt, Tursentur, Elbagen, Cham, Scho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>see, Kunsperg, Stauff,</HI> and some others, which for the most part belong to the Prince <HI>Palatines.</HI> This Country also of <HI>Nortgow</HI> doth include one of the foure Landgraviates, which were heretofore in∣stituted by the Emperours, namely <HI>Lutchtenberg,</HI> in the second Cir∣cle of the Empire, which was so denominated from the Castle <HI>Luth∣tenberg,</HI> albeit the Princes of that Territorie doe keepe their Court at <HI>Pfriembdt</HI> and sometime at <HI>Grunsfeld.</HI> This Landgraviate did not grow so powerfull as the other three, which in processe of time were much enlarged both in territorie and power: but especially the Landgraviate of <HI>Hassia,</HI> as <HI>Munster</HI> writeth. This Country is watered and enriched by these Rivers, namely <HI>Egar, Nubus, Vilsus, Regus, Pennitius, Schwartzach, Sultza, Altimulus,</HI> and <HI>Lautra,</HI> and some others. Historians doe relate concerning the River <HI>Regni∣tius,</HI> or <HI>Regus,</HI> that <HI>Charles</HI> the Great being at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> was perswaded; that a navigable passage might be made out of <HI>Rhene</HI> in∣to <HI>Danubius,</HI> if a ditch were made betweene the Rivers <HI>Regnitius</HI> and <HI>Altimulus,</HI> which might be capable to receive and carry boates and vessells: because the one of those Rivers doe runne into <HI>Danubius</HI> and the other into <HI>Rhene.</HI> The King straightway chuseth out a conve∣nient place for this work, and having got great store of Labourers, he spent all the <HI>Autumne</HI> quarter about it. So that a ditch was made
<PB N="556" REF="466"/>
betweene the aforesoyd Rivers, which was two miles long, and three hundered foote broade. But this worke came to nothing, for by reason of the raine, and that the soyle was a Moorish kind of earth, the worke could not stand, for the earth fell downe in the night, and filled up as much as they had digged in the day time. Neere the Towne <HI>Weiseberg,</HI> there are some tokens yet remaining of this vaine attempt. It is to bee noted that all the Rivers of <HI>Nortgow</HI> have Iron mills and other mettall mills, so that they doe blow the bellowes, and drive the two hammers with their streames, so that the Smith neede but put the Iron under the Hammers on the Anvill, and the water will make the Hammers forge it. There is in this Countrie the Mount <HI>Pinifer,</HI> commonly called <HI>Fitchtelbergk,</HI> being sixe miles about: out of which there doe flow foure famous Rivers, <HI>Moenus, Nabus, Sala,</HI> and <HI>Egra,</HI> which winding in the figure of a crosse; doe runne toward the foure severall corners of the world. This Mountaine doth produce divers kind of mettalls, and the best blew colour, which is called <HI>Lazurus.</HI> There is Lead also found on the top of the Mountaine, and many pits, out of which mettalls were formerly digged. This Country also is, very where cloathed with some pieces of the wood <HI>Hercinia,</HI> as <HI>Weisenburwalt, Behe∣merwalt,</HI> and others, which are represented in this Table. Moreo∣ver when <HI>Bavaria</HI> had received the Christian faith, there were lawes made, enacted for the government of the Land, namely con∣cerning the libertie of the Church, concerning Church-burners, and Incendiaries, concerning those that tooke Sanctuarie, concerning strikers of the Clergie, concerning Tithes, seditious persons; also Martiall Lawes, Lawes for the tenure of Lands, for Brokage; for titles of inhaeritances, for buying and selling, &amp;c. These lawes the <HI>Bavarians</HI> obeyed for many yeares, and some of them they doe still obey. And here I cannot chuse but adde some of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Lawes. It was enacted that the Iudge, to the end hee might judge rightly, should have the Booke of the Statutes, and that thereby he should determine and end all sutes and controversies. Neither should the Iudges respect persons or gifts, but when he had Iudged right∣ly he should have the ninth part of the composition money. But if wrongfully, he should pay twice as much, as he had tooke away by his unjust judgement: and moreover should be fined fortie shillings. He that sold any thing for a certaine price, should set downe the bar∣gaine in writing, and have witnesses thereunto. No bargaine or sale unlesse it were free and voluntarie, should be firme and currant. I omit the rest, least I should seeme to over burden this description, with the repetition of those lawes, which <HI>Iohn Boeme Aubanus</HI> doth describe at large.</P>

After whose death his Father <HI>Retz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> surviving after him was Prince of <HI>Rugia</HI> in the yeere 1106. whose Posterity did successively possesse the Principality of <HI>Rugia,</HI> even to <HI>Wartiflaus,</HI> in whom in the yeere 1352. the Royall Line of the Princes of <HI>Rugia</HI> was extinct, and the Dukedome of <HI>Rugia</HI> came to the Princes of <HI>Po∣merania,</HI> and that by a certaine mutuall covenant and agreement, whereby it was agreed, that if they did not leave Sonnes to succeed them in their owne Dukedomes, the Dukedome for want of a Prince, should descend and come to the other Duke. There were three Churches at <HI>Charantina,</HI> and many Idols in them: of the chiefe where∣of is <HI>Rugae-viti:</HI> which had seven faces on one head, and seven swords buckled to it, holding in its right hand a naked sword. It was a long thicke, and terrible Idoll, which they called <HI>Mars,</HI> or the God of warre. The other had five faces on one head, and without a sword which they called the God of peace. The third had foure faces on one head, and one in his breast, holding his forehead with his left hand, and laying his right hand on his knee which they called <HI>Por∣cuitum</HI> and the God of their Empire. It would bee tedious to speake of their other monstrous gods. <HI>Areona</HI> was heretofore the strongest Citty of <HI>Rugia,</HI> being situate on the highest Promontory of the <HI>Penin∣sula Wittoviae</HI> Northward, on the North, and East it is encompassed with the Sea, on the other side with a low Valley, there are some ruines of this Citty yet remaining. The Valley was so deepe, so that an Arrow shot upright out of a strong Bow could not reach to the top. This Citty was besieged on Ascention day, and it was taken on Saint <HI>Vitus</HI> day, by Gods providence, who punished their Idolatries even on Saint <HI>Vitus</HI> day, which did first spring and arise from S. <HI>Vitus.</HI> The Citizens of <HI>Arcona</HI> trusting at first to their Citty and Castle, did valiantly resist the Enemy, but at length on Saint <HI>Vitus</HI> day being wea∣ried and tyred, they were enforced to accept of conditions of Peace, and to receive the Christian Religion, and to yeeld unto the Conque∣rers the revenewes of the <HI>Swantovian</HI> Church and Idoll to maintaine Christian Ministers: also to burne the Idoll <HI>Swanto</HI> with the Temple, and to set the Christian Captaines at liberty without any ransome, and to pay tribute every yeere to the King of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> The strong Citty being taken, the Citty <HI>Charentina</HI> did yeeld it selfe upon the same conditions.

glideth thorow the middle of it. The Metropolis and Mother Citty of this Kingdome is <HI>Buda,</HI> which was so denominated, as the most doe suppose from <HI>Buda</HI> the builder of it, who was Brother to King <HI>Artila,</HI> or as others write, from the Budines, a People of <HI>Scythia,</HI> of whom <HI>Herodotus</HI> maketh mention. If you consider the Situation of this Citty, it is seated partly on a Mountaine, and fortified with strong Bulwarkes, so that it is the strongest, and pleasantest Citty in all <HI>Hungaria,</HI> it hath many faire buildings both publike and private. It standeth in a fruitfull soyle, <HI>Soliman</HI> the Turkish Emperour tooke it from the Christians in the yeere 1526. on the 20. day of August. The Next is <HI>Posonium,</HI> commonly called <HI>Prezborgh,</HI> which is a noble Citty. Here the River <HI>Leyta</HI> deviding the higher <HI>Pannonia</HI> from the lower, doth mingle it selfe with the River <HI>Istrus.</HI> It is an ancient faire Citty, having a pleasant ayre and situation, and doth therein excell all tne Citties of <HI>Pannonia.</HI> It hath Mountaines planted with Vines, which are also full of Wood. In the Suburbs it hath a Castle seated on the top of a high Rocke. There is also <HI>Belgrad</HI> at the meeting or confluence of the Rivers <HI>Savus,</HI> and <HI>Danubius,</HI> it is commonly called <HI>Alba Graeca,</HI> the ancients called it <HI>Taurunum,</HI> and the Germanes <HI>Griechs Weissenburgh: Soliman</HI> the Turke tooke it in the yeere 1520. and ha∣ving beene before a Towne of defence against the cruell enemy of Christianity, now it is the Turkish Emperours seat. A little lower downe the River <HI>Danubius</HI> there is <HI>Singidunum,</HI> which was taken by the Turke in the yeere 1439. In the midst betweene these two Cit∣ties, there is a Field famous for the victory of <HI>Hunniadus</HI> against <HI>Maho∣met</HI> the Turkish Emperour: they call this Field <HI>Maxons.</HI> This Battle was fought in the yeere 1456. Downe the River there are many pla∣ces where the Christians have received many fatall overthrowes. The Citty <HI>Valpo</HI> was taken in the yeere 1543. <HI>Quinque Ecclesiae</HI> by <HI>Dra∣vus</HI> in the yeere 1543. <HI>Zigetha</HI> was taken in the yeere 1566. <HI>Buda</HI> wee have mentioned before. <HI>Strigonium</HI> by <HI>Danubius,</HI> commonly called <HI>Gran,</HI> was heretofore an Archbishops seat, but it is now in the Turkes hands. <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> or <HI>Stulweyssenburg,</HI> is famous in regard the Kings are crowned and buried here, it was taken in the yeere 1543. In the same Country there is <HI>Stridon,</HI> where Saint <HI>Hierom</HI> was borne. There is al∣so the Citty <HI>Comara,</HI> in an Iland of the same name, which the Turkes in vaine attempted. <HI>Iaarinum,</HI> commonly called <HI>Raab</HI> is an impregna∣ble Citty by the River <HI>Danubius.</HI> I passe by the other Townes. There are also in <HI>Hungaria</HI> many famous Lakes, the chiefe whereof is <HI>Balaton,</HI> which the Germanes call <HI>Platze,</HI> being 40. Italian miles broad, and 8. Hungarian miles. The chiefest Rivers are <HI>Danubius, Savus, Dravus,</HI> and <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> the three former are common to other Countries, but <HI>Ti∣biscus</HI> runneth onely thorow <HI>Hungary.</HI> It riseth in <HI>Maramusia,</HI> in the high cliffes of <HI>Carpatus,</HI> and for plenty of Fish it exceedeth all the Ri∣vers in <HI>Hungary,</HI> for it hath abundance of all kindes of Fish, as great Pikes, Lampreys, and Sturgeons. There are also other Rivers be∣sides these, which have great store of excellent Fish, as Trowts, Sal∣mons, Perches, Lampreys, Barbels, and others, and those Rivers have gold veines in them.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>ERMANIE was described before both in general and speciall: and now having viewed the former I doe enter into <HI>Italy:</HI> which as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith <HI>Lib.

It had heretofore divers names. <HI>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, Lib.</HI> 1. of Roman Antiquities, writeth that the native people did call this noble Coun∣try <HI>Saturnia:</HI> and the Graecians did call it <HI>Hesperia, Ausonia,</HI> and <HI>Oeno∣tria:</HI> and that at last in <HI>Hercules</HI> time it began to be called <HI>Italy.</HI> It was called <HI>Saturnia</HI> from King <HI>Saturne.</HI> But it seemeth that this appellati∣on did not appertaine to all <HI>Italy,</HI> but to a part of it, which was also called <HI>Latium. Hyginus</HI> would have it called <HI>Hesperia,</HI> from <HI>Hesperus,</HI> who fled from his Brother <HI>Atlas:</HI> and <HI>Macrobius</HI> from <HI>Hesperus</HI> the Eve∣ning Starre, in Latine call'd <HI>Vesperugo,</HI> which is seene alwayes in the West. It was call'd <HI>Ausonia</HI> from <HI>Auson.</HI> They call'd it <HI>Oenotria</HI> from the goodnesse of the Wine, or from <HI>Oenotrus</HI> King of the Sabius. It was called <HI>Italy</HI> from <HI>Italus,</HI> whom <HI>Aristotle</HI> maketh to be King of <HI>Oeno∣tria.</HI> But <HI>Festus</HI> saith, <HI>Lib. 9.

liken <HI>Italy</HI> to an Ivie leafe: <HI>Pliny, Solinus,</HI> and others, doe resemble it to an Oke leafe, because it is longer then broad, bending his head on the left hand, and so endeth in the figure of an Amazonian Brestplate. The latter Writers doe more conveniently compare it to a mans thigh, the skin whereof lyeth over against the lower Sea: the Calfe over against the higher Sea: and all the foote is washed with the Jonian Sea: The heele doth looke toward <HI>Epirum:</HI> the sole of the foote is the Tarrentine Bay, the more fleshy parts doe make the Pro∣nontories <HI>Zephyrius, Carcinus,</HI> and <HI>Bruttium,</HI> the toes are turned toward <HI>Sicily,</HI> the knee is in the Populonian Promontory, the hippe and up∣per part of the thigh doe touch the Alpes. I have spoken of the name and quantity of <HI>Italy:</HI> the quality followeth, which alwaies ariseth from the Situation of a Country. If any one will take a diligent ac∣count of it, he shall finde that according to the Longitude, the most Westerne Meridian doth fall upon the 29. degree; and the most Ea∣sterne Meridian the 43. degree. It is 7. degrees in Latitude: for the most Southerne Parallel is 28. degrees distant from the Aequator, and the most Northward 46. and so he shall finde that <HI>Italy</HI> is in the fifth and sixth Climats, and all the Parallels between eleven and sixteene, in which space of Land the day differeth one houre. For the longest day of Summer in the Southerne Parallel is 14. houres long, with three fifths, but in the Northerne Parallel it is 15. houres long with three fifths.. <HI>Italy</HI> having such a Situation, and having the Alpes run∣ning thorow it, which passe length-wayes thorow the middle of <HI>Italy,</HI> on both sides, especially on the South side have faire fruitfull Fields &amp; Hills lying by them: and therefore it is no marvell, that all the times and seasons of the yeere are so temperate, and that it is so fruitfull, especially in some places. The Country is very temperate, and very plentifull, and hath good store of Corne, being not chargeable in til∣ling, but very gainefull to the Husbandman. The Rosselanian fields in <HI>Vmbria</HI> are reported to have beene so fruitful, that <HI>Varro</HI> witnesseth, <HI>Cesar Vopiscus,</HI> when he pleaded his cause before the Censors, said that the Rosean Fields were the <HI>Senum Italiae,</HI> in which if a Pitchforke bee left the day before, the grasse will cover it over in one nights growth. Vnto speaking of the endowments of <HI>Italy,</HI> saith, that it produceth all things necessary for food. <HI>Campania</HI> doth yeeld Corne, <HI>Falernus</HI> wine: <HI>Cassinas</HI> Oyle: <HI>Tusculan</HI> Figges, <HI>Tarrentine</HI> Honey: and <HI>Tiber</HI> Fish. Moreover <HI>Pliny</HI> witnesseth that <HI>Italy</HI> is the Mother of all kindes of Trees. I will not mention the Vulgar common sort. For here are great store of Orange Trees, Lemmon Trees, and Quince Trees. All the Coast, as for example, <HI>Liguria,</HI> and that which belongeth to <HI>Genoa,</HI> is adorned and beautified with faire Trees, and great high Palme Trees, which are full of sweet smelling fruit, so that it is pleasant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth in sight and scent: and it hath every where pleasant Gardens to recreate sad mindes, and drive away Melancholy. And the same may be said of a thousand other places. The same <HI>Pliny</HI> sheweth that there are Pepper trees in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Hydruntine Country hath abundance of Olives, so that he that hath not seene the great Woods of Olive trees which are in these parts, would thinke it incredible. The Barian
<PB N="692" REF="501"/>
Fields in <HI>Apulia Peucetia,</HI> doe bring forth great store of Oyle, Wine, Corne, Almonds, and Cotton, and other fruits. The Valley of <HI>Onelia</HI> in <HI>Liguria,</HI> hath such great store of Oyle, that sometimes it yeeldeth 32. and 22. thousand Jarres, which the Inhabitants call <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rilas.</HI> There is also Manna in <HI>Italy.</HI> For Manna is gathered neere <HI>Altom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntium</HI> in <HI>Brutia,</HI> which falleth downe like dew by night, especially when the skie is serene and cleare after raine. It is gathered from the Leaves of certaine Trees. <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth that it hath the choisest and best Vines, so that it excelleth the most odoriferous Nations of the world, for there is no scent to be compared with the delicious smell of the sweet budding Vines. As the excellent Wines which are so celebra∣ted and praised by ancient Writers doe testifie. <HI>Pliny</HI> doth devide the Wines of <HI>Italy</HI> into foure sorts. He preferreth the Setine Wines before all others, which was so called from <HI>Setia</HI> a Towne of <HI>Latium.</HI> The next he accounteth to be the Falerne Wine.

It is very fruitfull in producing all kinde of hearbes. What should I speake of the Mettals, Stones, and other gifts. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that it is inferiour unto no Country for Mettals.

<P><HI>Italy,</HI> besides other Fowle, hath Eagles and Vultures, which are so often mentioned in the ancient Romane Histories. I come now to the ancient Government. There is no indubitable certainty concer∣ning the ancient Government of <HI>Italie. Annius</HI> of <HI>Viterbium</HI> doth speake of <HI>Comer,</HI> who came first into this Country as a stranger, also of <HI>Chamus, Ianus, Sabatius, Sagus, Cranus, Aurunus, Malotte, Tages, Ofrides, Her∣cules, Tuscus, Alteus, Ritis, Italus, Morgetes, Roma, Romanessus, Iasius,</HI> and
<PB N="693" REF="501"/>
others: but approoved Historians doe make no mention of them. But if we read <HI>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, Pompeus Trogus, Solinus Polyhistor,</HI> and other Greeke and Latine Writers, that many yeeres before the building of <HI>Rome,</HI> wee shall finde that <HI>Italie</HI> was governed by divers people, as Sicilians, the Aboriginians, the Ligurians, the Umbrians, and the Etrurians: which at last were all reduced under the govern∣ment of the Romane Empire. <HI>Rome</HI> at the first was governed by Kings for 245. yeeres together, as <HI>Dionysius</HI> and <HI>Livie</HI> doe witnesse, whom in the Romane History it is best to follow. In whom wee may read the order and progresse of their atchievements, and it is to be considered, that their power did encrease abroad by military Discipline, and at home by moderation and Justice, and by the order of government. Afterward the Kings for their tyranny and lust were expelled, which many times had caused many changes, and mutations in the Empire. The names of the Kings are these: <HI>Romulus,</HI> who raigned 38. yeeres, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who raigned 43. yeeres, <HI>Tullus Hostilius,</HI> who raigned 32. yeeres, <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Martius,</HI> who raigned 24. yeeres, <HI>Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> who raigned 37. yeeres, <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> who raigned 44. yeeres, <HI>Tarquinius Superbus,</HI> who raigned 25. yeeres. He was expelled the Kingdome for his Sons wicked act, who ravished <HI>Lucretia.</HI> But when the Kings were expelled, the government became Annuall, and two Consuls were created. The first of which was <HI>L. Iunius Brutus,</HI> unto whom was joyned <HI>Sp. Lu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ius Tricipitinus.</HI> and after him <HI>M. Horatius Pulvillus.</HI> Thus <HI>Italie</HI> was governed by Consuls, untill the time of the Emperour <HI>Caesar Fl. Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lus Augustulus,</HI> whom <HI>Odoacer Herulus</HI> King of the Gothes did de∣pose, and subverted the Country to himselfe, and afterward being shine, he left it to <HI>Theoderick</HI> his Successors. I need not set downe a Catalogue of the Romane Consuls and Emperours, which are well knowne. And we may read in Histories the forme of the first royall government, the changes of Lawes and Magistrates, the Romanes valour, their warres, and their many civill dissentions, untill <HI>Rome</HI> had got the Monarchie of the World: and how by luxury, civill warres, and the fatall vicissitude and change of things, it lost againe both vertue, and Empire. I proceed to other matters. <HI>Italie</HI> hath ma∣ny faire flourishing rich Citties, many famous populous Townes: and many Villages, adorned with Noblemens houses. It will not there∣fore be impertinent to set downe what <HI>Thomas Edwards</HI> an English∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n hath written concerning the most famous Citties of <HI>Italie.</HI></P>

And these are the Sea Alpes, which ar also calld the <HI>Ligustina</HI> Alpes: The Cottian, Graecian, Penine, the Sammian Alpes, the Lepontian, the Rhetian, Iulian and Carnici∣an. And so much concerning the Alpes, which breadthwayes doe se∣perat and parte <HI>Italie</HI> from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germanie,</HI> the Apinine follow∣eth, which running with a continuing ridge betweene the higher and the lower Sea, it divideth it length wayes into two parts or sides. It is thought to have beene so called, because the foote of this Hill is by <HI>Hannibals</HI> Penine passage. Some thinke it was called the <HI>Apenine,</HI> be∣cause the Paenians or Carthaginians breaking into <HI>Italie</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Hanniball</HI> did make and open a passage this way, some de∣rive it from <HI>Apis</HI> an ancient Captaine who overcame and conquerd all <HI>Italie. Ptolamie</HI> and others call it <HI>Appennina, Stephanus Apennium,</HI> the Apennine Mountaine, saith <HI>Pliny,</HI> is the greatest in <HI>Italie,</HI> running with a continued ridge from the Alpes to the Sicillian straite. <HI>Italie</HI> hath many other Mountaines, which are either parts or pieces of the Apennine, or such as it thrusteth forth here and there, or such as lye at the foote thereof, so that it overlookes them. But I passe over them, least I should be tedious. Moreover the Mountaines &amp; aforesaid, the Valleys and fields are crowned with woods, groves, and thicketts, many of which are named and celebrated by the ancients. In <HI>Etruria</HI> there is the wood <HI>Viterbium,</HI> which in Italian is called <HI>Boscodi Monte <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>one,</HI> which is commonly calld <HI>Bolsena,</HI> the ancients as <HI>Leander</HI> repor∣teth did call it the Valsinan Wood.

In <HI>Latium</HI> among the Capenatians there was the Wood <HI>Feronia,</HI> of which <HI>Silius</HI> singeth thus.</P>

And that we may begin with the sacred workes, they are almost infinite, for <HI>Rome</HI> alone hath at this day above 300. Churches, of which seven are chiefly resorted unto for Religion sake; the first is Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church in the Vatican: which exceedeth all the Churches in the World for costly Marble worke, and magnificent building. There are many singular things in it: as some Pillars which were brought out of <HI>Salomons</HI> Temple: two Brasse Peacocks which were brought from <HI>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</HI> his Pyramisse, which was heretofore in the Vatican Valley. There are also the Tombes and Sepulchers of many Popes, and a Marble Tombe of the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the second: and in the Popes Chappell there is Doomesday, or the day of Judge∣ment lively drawne by <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI> And that I may not omit the Monasteries, the Hospitals for Strangers, the Hospitals for the Sicke, and for Orphanes. What should I speake of the Popes and Cardinals Palaces? The Popes Palace is in the highest part of the Valitan, being fairely seated: who leaving his Lateran Palace, did re∣moove thither in regard of the pleasantnesse and wholesomenesse of the Seate. It was begun by Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> the third, and enlarged by others, but perfected by <HI>Iulian</HI> the second, and <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, and at last it was adorned with Buildings and Pictures by <HI>Xistus</HI> the fifth, so that now the proud Pile seemeth to touch the Heavens. The Staires are broad and easie to ascend, so that one may ride on Horseback to the top of the House. For it is so great that it seemeth rather a Town than a House, there is <HI>Xistus</HI> Chapell which is as big as a great Church, whether when the See is vacant, the Cardinals doe meete together to create a Pope, which is commonly called the Conclave. It would be tedious to mention the other Palaces, and therefore we will passe to other matters. The government of <HI>Italie</HI> followeth, which is two∣fold; Politicall and Ecclesiasticall. Concerning the Politick and Civill government, this noble Country is devided into many Signio∣ries. Among which, beside the Pope, the King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the free Commonwealths, as <HI>Venice, Genoa, Lucensis,</HI> and others, the chiefe in the Northerne part are, the Princes of <HI>Etruria, Ferrara, Mantua, Me∣diolanum, Montis-Feratensis,</HI> of <HI>Parma,</HI> of <HI>Salluzzia,</HI> and <HI>Verona.</HI> In the Southerne part there are many Nobles, which when occasion shall be offerd, I will reckon up in their proper places. In Ecclesiastick

government the Pope is the Hierarch and the head of the Church, and hath a great Traine. <HI>Quoties pro cedit Gemmis conspicitur ornatus, &amp; Seri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is vestibus, tectus Auro, vectus Equo albo, stipatus Milite, circumstrepenti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s septus Ministris.</HI> That is, as often as the Pope goes forth, hee wea∣reth silke Robes, embroidered with Gold and Pearle, he rideth on a white Horse, and is garded with Souldiers, and hath Officers which play on Musick before him. The other Priests are here much honou∣red, and have great authority. And are more honoured than Noble∣men. The Cardinals as <HI>Peter Mossias</HI> noteth, did succeed in place of the Consuls, who heretofore governed the Romane Empire: the Archbishops are equall to Dukes: the Bishops to Earles, their Vicars or Substitutes are as it were Presidents of the Empire, &amp; the Provosts are as it were Praefects: the Arch-priests are in the place of Tribunes of Souldiers, and the Chancellors doe represent the Tribunes of the People. Moreover, <HI>Italie</HI> hath a threefold Law, the Pontificall, the Caesarian, and the Municipall, the first and second are to be knowne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her wheres; the third consists of Statutes and Lawes, which the Citties themselves doe enact and make: but let so much suffice. I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ely here set downe that which is read in a certaine Manuscript concerning the Counsels of these severall Citties. It is written the Mediolanians are excellent in Counsel: the Venetians wise: the Lu∣canians rash: the Pisanians inconstant: the Placentians provident: the Florentines slow: the Veronians faithfull: the Ferrarians wary: the Genoans ignorant: the Lucensians profitable: the Volscians en∣vious: the Brutians blockish: the Mutinensians acute and ingenious: the Perusinians quick and ready: the Senenians slow: and the Patavi∣ans irresolute. The Italians doe maintaine, cherish, and honour Schol∣lers, and are good Maecenasses unto them. And hence there are so many Universities in <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Romana, Mediolanum, Bononia, Patavina, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iensis, Naples, Perusina, Salerne, Pisona, Ferrara, Senensis, Florence, Vene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gomensis, Mutinensis,</HI> and <HI>Taurinensis;</HI> for the Universities of <HI>Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Placentia, Anconita,</HI> and <HI>Macerata,</HI> are for the most part decayed. And hence proceedeth that great plenty of Doctors, and famous men learned in divers Arts and Disciplines. It would be troublesome un∣to me to reckon up a Catalogue of them, and tedious to the Reader. Moreover, the Italians doe exceed other people for courteous con∣versation, for gentlenesse, and for witty conference, and discourse. They are very ingenious and witty, quick of invention, and very do∣cible, in matters of study, and also in learning divers Arts. They have in all ages thirsted after honour and glory, and have beene more de∣sirous of praise than any others. They are soft and effeminate, and gi∣ven to Venery, quenching pleasure with Milke, as fire is with Oyle. They are very desirous of revenge: and they thinke it sweeter than life, and doe sometime leave it by Will to their Posterity. Moreo∣over the aforesaid Manuscript doth paint forth the women of divers Citties in this manner: the Senensians are faire: the Florentines de∣licate: the Perusenians neat: the Cajetanians faire: the Consentine∣ans obstinate: the Beneventanians clownish: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bononians arro∣gant and proud: the Mutinensians bountifull: the Cesenatians cove∣tously

scraping: the Genoans wanton: the Cremonians deceitfull▪ the Placentians hard: the Lucensians chaste: the Pistoriensians lo∣ving and tractable. The Romans grave: the Capuanians proud: the Neapolitans carefull: the Brundisinians slothfull: the Ferrarians greedy: the Ravennatians courteous: the Urbinatians affable: the Vincentinians constant: the Parmensians covetous: the Papiensians desirous of gaine: the Mediolanensians witty conceited: the Pede∣montanians prating and talkative: the Venetians wanton: the Ver∣ronians comely: the Brixians diligent: the Formianians faire and beautifull: the Laudensians superstitious: the Cremonensians costly: the Tarvisians jealous: the Bergomatians crafty: the Aretinians sa∣ving: and the Puteolanians faire. The Italians were heretofore sot∣tishly adicted to many superstitions. But now they doe all religiously observe the Ceremonies and Rites of the Romane Church: but that some few in the Southerne part of <HI>Italy</HI> do follow the Graecian Rites, who are also descended of the Graecians. But what a warlike people the Italians have beene, the conquest of the world doth declare. And the aforesaid Manuscript doth shew which Citties doe exceed others in matter of Warre. In warlike affaires the Perusinians are stout: the Calabrians rash: the Spoletanians crafty: the Senensians for∣tunate: the Bononians fierce: the Neapolitans couragious: the Tu∣rentines are mitigators of their enemy: the Pratensians sacrilegious: the Collensians lustfull: the Picenians ravenous: the Aemilians in∣considerate: the Placentinians cruell: the Romanes valiant: the Mediolanians undaunted: the Vincentinians desirous of revenge: the Pistorians bloody: the Papiensians firme and constant. Their Diet is sober and frugall, and they are not curious in furnishing their Tables, but when necessity requires. They doe not all weare one kinde of habit, but they vary according to the time or the quality of the Person, and also in the forme and shape of it. The Matrons here∣tofore did goe with naked armes, brests, and shoulders, and now they cover all with thin Vailes according to the Spanish fashion. The Ve∣netians goe civilly and neatly, the Florentians, the Tuscians, the Me∣diolanians, the Aemilians, and Ligurians, doe goe somewhat braver. But the Romane Courtier doth excell all the rest for long various colour'd Garments, but the Romane Citizen goeth more frugally, yet hansomely, but especially the women who of late did affect the Tuscane dressing. <HI>Naples</HI> hath a habit that is more shining and splen∣dide than costly. The Mediolanians in their apparell are gorgious, the Genoas neat, the Mantuans childish, the Neapolitans costly, the Venetians magnificent, the Florentines ridiculous. In revenging of injuries the Lucensians are gentle, the Mediolanians are soone re∣concil'd, the Perusinians are dissemblers, the Fulginatians are hot, the Mutinensians are placable, the Senensians couragious. The Nea∣politans are bountifull, the Ferrarians stiffe conceited, the Venetians crafty, the Cremonians plaine and open, the Picenians backbiters, the Romanes unjust. Toward Strangers the Calabrians are inhospi∣table, the Lucen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s faithfull, the Senensians loving, the Venetian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> faire-spoken, the Patavinians hard, the Mediolanians unwary, the

Ferrarians sharpe, the Mantuans flatterers, the Placentians severe, the Picenians troublesome, the Neapolitans bountifull, the Floren∣tines profuse and prodigall, the Astensians benevolent, the Spole∣tanes rude and rustick, the Verronians studious, the Papiensians wise, the Genoaes inhospitable, the Parmensians inconstant, the Mutinen∣sians tedious in speech, the Novocomians inhumane. Lastly, the Italians are much given to merchandizing. And the same Manuscript sheweth their dispositions in trading and commerce: namely, the Florentines are crafty, the Genoaes tolerable, the Mediotanians plaine and open, the Lucensians faithfull, the Venetians stately and vary.</P>

Here are many Citties and Townes: as <HI>Mediolanum, Crema, Bergomum, Comum, Clavenna, Luganum, &amp;c.</HI> which may be seene in the Table.

And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore this County may be equal'd and compared not onely to a Dukedome, but also to a Kingdome.

And although it be not fortified with walls, Bul∣warks, or Towers, yet it is strong by the naturall situation. It is de∣vided with many Channels. There are Rivers in all the streets, which are joyned together by 450. stone and woodden Bridges. The chief∣est Channell is that which is called <HI>Canal grande,</HI> three miles long, which devideth the whole Citty into two parts. So that you may ei∣ther goe on foote, or by Boate, of which there are 8000. thorow the Citty, they commonly call these Boates <HI>Gondelas.</HI> The compasse of this Citty is about 8. miles, which is famous for populousnesse, wealth, and store of Merchandise: it hath produced excellent wits, and most learned men, and it is adorned with good Lawes, and laudable Sta∣tutes. It doth abound with Corne which is brought thither out of divers parts of the World, as also with divers sorts of Wine, among which is that generous sort of Wine, which is commonly called Malmesy, and with other things, necessary to mans life, so that it may be rightly call'd the Paradise of Delight. There are in it 64. Parishes. There are also magnificent and sumptuous publike and private buil∣dings. The chiefest Church is that which is dedicated to Saint <HI>Marke</HI> the Evangelist, which is gilded in many places. And to omit other matters, there is an Armory within the Citty, commonly call'd the <HI>Arsenale,</HI> which is about two miles in compasse. Here are made of Wood, Iron, Brasse, Hempe, and Flaxe, all kindes of provision for Ships, as Anchors, Guns, Cables, Ropes, Tackles, and Sailes. Here are also some Ensignes kept which were taken from the Turke, or Pirates, or Enemies, and those Trophies which were taken at <HI>Nau∣pactum</HI> in the yeere 1581. And also there are the Praetorian Barges, and the Ship <HI>Bucentaurus,</HI> in which the Prince accompanied with the Senate and chiefe men of the Citty, is carryed every yeere to the en∣trance of the Sea, where the Castle standeth, and there after some Ce∣remonies performed by the Bishop, he marrieth the Sea, and puts a Ring upon it to shew his perpetuall dominion over it. There is also a publike Library, together with the Library of <HI>Bessarion</HI> Cardinall of <HI>Nicen,</HI> which at his death he gave to the Common-wealth of <HI>Venice. Venice</HI> is very populous, so that there are thought to be in it about 300000. Citizens. They are of three sorts or rankes: the Patricians who governe the Empire and Common-wealth: the Citizens who doe beare under Offices: and the Artificers who use Mechanick Arts. And besides these there are great store of Merchants and Strangers, which come thither in divers habits out of all parts of the World to
<PB N="713" REF="513"/>
trafficke: as Turkes, Aethiopians, Slavonians, Arabians, Syrians, Cretensians, Cyprians, Macedonians, Germanes, Hungarians, Spani∣ards, Frenchmen, and others. The Venetian Common-wealth was governed at the first by Consuls, afterward by Tribunes for 252. yeeres: afterward in the yeere 707. it began to be a Dukedome. The Duke commonly call'd <HI>Doge,</HI> is the head of the Common-wealth, and the Prince of the Senate, and he can doe nothing neither in time of peace or warre without the consent of the Senate, for he consulteth with them. The Senate make Decrees which yet are published in the Dukes name. The Duke hath certaine stipends paid him out of the publike stock: and after his decease another is chosen by suffrages and voyces, out of the Senate. The Senate which is commonly call'd <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siglio,</HI> is the Basis and Foundation of the whole State: the Members of it are all Nobles, of 25. yeeres of age, or above: who have free liberty to speake: very faithfull in Counsell, and very care∣full to preserve their liberty, and enlarge their Empire, and very constant in adversity. There are many other Magistrates besides the Duke, which here for brevity sake I omit. This Citty is held to bee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fairest and most flourishing Citty of all others, the Theater of the World, and the common Mart for the whole Universe, the Mistresse and Conquerour over so many Enemies: the Queene of the Hadria∣tick Sea, and the glory and honour of <HI>Italie.</HI> Although it hath waged many warres, and tryed the varieties of fortune for the space of a thousand yeeres, yet it was never subdued by any forraine Enemy. I passe by the other Citties and lesser Townes. The most famous Ri∣vers of this Gountry are <HI>Plavis,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Piave,</HI> also <HI>Brenta, Ba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>io,,</HI> and <HI>Athesis,</HI> which is the greatest of them all. There are Moun∣taines in this Patavine Country, which neither belong to the Alpes, nor to the Apennine, so that in this respect there is no Country like it in <HI>Italie.</HI> One of these Mountaines is <HI>Gemula,</HI> the other <HI>Venda,</HI> and the Euganean Hills so famoused by Poets. There are subject to the Patriarch of <HI>Aquilegium,</HI> the Bishopricks of <HI>Mantua,</HI> of <HI>Cuman,</HI> of <HI>Tri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tum,</HI> of <HI>Verona,</HI> of <HI>Maravia,</HI> of <HI>Padua,</HI> of <HI>Vicentium,</HI> of <HI>Trevisium,</HI> of <HI>Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>da,</HI> of <HI>Feltre,</HI> of <HI>Bellun.</HI> And so much briefely concerning the County of <HI>Tirolis,</HI> and <HI>Marca Tarvisina.</HI></P>

Concerning the qualitie of this Country <HI>Leander</HI> wri∣teth that it hath a very good soile, yeelding all kinds of fruites both for delight &amp; necessary use. Here are large fields planted with al kinds of fruite bearing trees, pleasant Hills full of Vines, Olives, and Figgs, Woods full of fruite, Meddowes full of grasse, and Bushie thickets fit for hunting, also many wholsome waters, many Salt-pits, both neere the Shoare side, and within the Countrie, also Mettalls Mines, and in∣numerable other excellent guifts of nature, which would be tedious to rehearse. There are some famous Citties in this Country and many Townes. The chiefe are, that which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and other call <HI>Arminum,</HI> the Inhalitants doe now call it <HI>Rimini,</HI> and the Germanes <HI>Rumelen.</HI> It was so so called from the River which watereth it. Others have other derivations. It aboundeth with plenty. The Haven was heretofore very faire, large and capable of Shipping, but now it receiveth one∣ly small vessells being filled &amp; choaked up with sand. There is also <HI>Cervia</HI> a Sea Cittie, heretofore called <HI>Phicoles.</HI> The <HI>Cernians</HI> for the most part are Salt-makers, of which they make so great gaine, that the Pope hath yearely from thence 60. thousand Crownes.

The ayre is not very wholesome. The compasse of it is 7. Miles. It hath 12. Gates, and Mag∣nificent houses, and Noblemens Pallaces. The Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> did institute an Universitie here, in the yeare 423. Now we come to <HI>Ferraria,</HI> concerning the name whereof there are divers opinions. But it is most probable that it was called from the Inhabitants of <HI>Ferrari∣da,</HI> which was beyond <HI>Po,</HI> who were translated hither in the yeare 423. by the Decree of the Emperour <HI>Theodosius:</HI> at what time it was a Village without walls, and afterward about the yeare 658. it was walled about by <HI>Smaragdus, Exarchus,</HI> and by degrees it was so much enlarged, that at length it became a noble Cittie. The Bishoprick was translated hither by Pope <HI>Vitellianus</HI> about the yeare 658. and 12. neighbouring Villages made subject unto it by the Emperour <HI>Constan∣tine</HI> the 2. who gave it also many Priviledges. It is now called <HI>Ferrara.</HI> And it is seated on the Banck of the River <HI>Po</HI> which watereth it on the East and South sides. The ayre is thick, in regard that it is situate in the Marshes. It hath straite, long, broade streetes, the most whereof the Marquesse <HI>Leonell</HI> caused to be paved with brick, and it is wonder∣fully beautified with publike and private buildings. There is a greate Church, and two Castles, the one by the River, the other over against S. <HI>Georges</HI> Church, which is the Dukes Seate: and both are well forti∣fied: it is populous, and aboundeth with plenty of all things, and it is one of the pleasantest Citties in <HI>Italie,</HI> being the head seate of the an∣cient and noble family of the <HI>Atestines.</HI> The Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the second did institute heere an University in contempt of <HI>Bononia.</HI> It hath a greate Plaine round about it but barren.

Miles: the bredth from the Castle on the Frontiers even to Rivoltella is forty Miles. The soyle in some parts is stony, and therefore untilled, and some part of it is very good. It hath abundance of Wheate, Oyle, Wine, Cattell, Wooll, and other pretious commodities. It hath also famous Quarries of Stone. And many wholesome medicinall hearbes, espe∣cially on the Mountaine <HI>Baldus,</HI> whether Phisitians doe often resort to gather them. The <HI>Tuscans</HI> are supposed to have built <HI>Verona,</HI> others thinke that the French Cenomanians did build it: who being expul∣sed, it was a long time subject to the Romanes, and <HI>Cn. Pompeius Strabo,</HI> the father of <HI>Magnus</HI> brought thither a Colonie. Afterward being wa∣sted by <HI>Attila</HI> King of the <HI>Hunns,</HI> it was afterward subject to many Ty∣rannies, first to the Kings of the Gothes: the <HI>Langbards</HI> did expel them, and the Frechmen under the conduct of Charles the great did expell the <HI>Langbards:</HI> after whom the <HI>Berengarians</HI> being droven out of <HI>Italy</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Otto</HI> the first, it enjoyed some quiet and rest under the authority and Protection of the Romane Empire. <HI>Actiolinus Romani∣nus</HI> having got it by force, did change the Praefectorship into a Lord∣ship, having expulsed <HI>Azo Atestinus,</HI> whom the Senate and People of <HI>Verona</HI> had made Praetor.

This Citty is a Bishoprick. The Inhabitants are magnificent, beautifull, comely, very witty, and prone to learning. I cannot omit this one thing that when the Venetians did fortifie this Citty, they found certaine hollow Caves, and when they digged in the Mountaines, they found Vrchins or hedghoggs of stone, also Oisters, Birds bills, and starre fishes which were as hard as any Stones.</P>

The breadth of it is eleven Miles, the compasse of it 122. Miles, from <HI>Formio</HI> aforesaid, even to the Fanatick Promonto∣rie, or the innermost corner of the Carnarian Bay.

great store of wine, oyle, and other fruites, but little wheate or other graine, except the fields <HI>Piscino</HI> and <HI>Humagio.</HI> There is a Mountaine commonly calld <HI>Major,</HI> which is full of wholesome drugs and hearbes, and Phisitians doe resort hither to gather them. <HI>Istria</HI> doth yeeld a∣bundance of Salt.

It hath a Castle in the midst fortified with foure Towers: It belongeth now to the Venetians. Five Miles off, there is another Castle, which is joyned to the continent with a stone Bridge.

<P><HI>CArniola</HI> was so named from the Carnian people, as also <HI>Carinthia.</HI> Concerning whom <HI>Valaterranus</HI> writeth thus <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. of his <HI>Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gra∣phie.</HI> The Carnians are beyond the Istrians, the Country is broade, beginning from <HI>Forum Iulium,</HI> and reaching to the Mountaines. The Country of <HI>Carniola</HI> although it bee Mountainous, as the other Coun∣tries of this Province; yet it hath plenty of Wine, Oyle, Fruite, aad Corne. But they make <HI>Carniola</HI> twofold: the drye which wanteth wa∣ter: and the moist, in which the River <HI>Nauus</HI> riseth, and also <HI>Nauportus</HI> which is now called <HI>Labatus,</HI> and many other Rivers. It is adorned with the title of a Dukedome. The chiefe Citty is <HI>Labacum,</HI> which hath the same name with the River. Some doe place <HI>Goritia</HI> in <HI>Carnio∣la,</HI> which we mentioned before in <HI>Forum Iulium.</HI> On the left hand banck of <HI>Sontius</HI> upwards, there are two Fortresses, which the Venetians built heretofore to defend the River, and to prevent the incursions and inroads of the Turkes. Moreover there is a Lake in this Country, which affordeth every yeare a harvest, fishing, and hunting. The Inha∣bitants doe call it <HI>Zircknitzerzee</HI> from the Towne <HI>Zircknitz,</HI> which is situated by it. But I will make a more accurrate description of it out of <HI>George Wernherus:</HI> it is enclosed every where with Mountaines, for halfe a Mile together it is not very broade. Out of the Mountaines there doe issue certaine small Rivers, which are every one contayned in their owne Channells: on the East side there are three, on the South five. The farther that they runne the more narrower they grow, for their bankes are straite, untill they are swallowed up in the hoany passages of the Cliffes, which seeme as if they were cut out by humane Industry. So that where they find an open place the waters doe spread abroade, and make a Lake. These waters doe as speedily runne back as they flowe forward, not onely in those narrow channells, but also through the earth, which when the Inhabitants perceive, they stopp the greater passages, and Concavities, and so goe to fishing, which is both pleasant and profitable. For the fish which they take here be∣ing salted is transported to other Countries. Moreover when the Lake is drie they have a kind of harvest, for they sowe it and mowe it before that it be overflow'd againe. It beareth such abundance of grasse, that in twenty dayes it will be ready to cut. Who therefore cannot chuse but admire at these wonders of nature? But so much cocerning these things, I passe to the rest.</P>

It hath abundance of Vineyards, which yeeld excellent rich Wine. The ancient Inhabitants were heretofore generally called Tyrrhe∣tians, Etruscians, and Tuscians. Afterward from <HI>Romulus</HI> time the Romanes began to warre against the Tuscians, which warre they maintained a long time, so that matters being brought to a dange∣rous estate, they were faine to send out a Dictator against them. But in the yeere from the building of the Citty 474. the Vulsinensians and the Vulciensians the most flourishing people of the Etruscians be∣ing overcome by the Consul. <HI>Ti. Coruncanius,</HI> they were added to the Romane Empire, and so the Empire was enlarged on that side e∣ven to <HI>Arnus.</HI> Neither had they afterward any just occasion to warre with the Tuscians. So that being thus subjected they continued faith∣full to the Romane People. But when the Romane Empire began to decline, they were oppressed with many calamities, by the Gothes, the Langbards, the Huns, and others. At length it came to passe that the greater part of <HI>Etruria</HI> is now subject to the great Duke of <HI>Etruria,</HI> under whose government there are these noble Townes, <HI>Florence, Pisa, Sena, Pratum, Pistorium, Volatterra, Mons Politianus, Aretium, Cortona, Pescia, Pientia, Mons Alcinus, Liburnum, Plumbinum,</HI> and many other Townes.

It is a very fertile Country, except in some places neere the Borders, where it is stony and mountainous, and hath many Marshes, which doe make the ayre thick and unwholsome. The Sicilians, the Aboriginians, the Pelasgians, the Arcadians, the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uncians, the Volscians, the Oscians, the Ausonians, and others did first inhabit it. So much briefly concerning <HI>Latium</HI> in generall: now our method requireth that wee should describe it in particular, beginning from that Citty which was heretofore the Compendium or Epitome of the whole world. This Citty sheweth her selfe in an∣cient <HI>Latium,</HI> as soone as you have passed out of <HI>Etruria</HI> over <HI>Tiberis.</HI> It will keepeth her former name.

There are five publike Hospitals for Strangers of all Nations, and 20. severall Hospitals for severall Nations, besides an University.

<P>THis Contry is now called <HI>Terra Laboris,</HI> or <HI>Terra di Lavoro,</HI> that is the Land of labour.

It hath Ditches, which are 80. feete deepe, 8. Gates, and spacious Market-places. There are great store of common Condiutes, out of which the water is conveied thorow an hundred Pipes. The figure of it is long, and it bendeth like an halfe Moone. The compasse of it heretofore was 3. miles, but now the Territories thereof being enlarged, it is 5. miles about. It hath a gentle pleasant ayre, and scarce any Winter. This Citty hath many faire Churches, and private Buildings, and a

strong impregnable Castle, with an University which was instituted by the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the second, unto which Students do come out of all parts of the Kingdome. There are also some Libraries, the chiefe whereof is S. <HI>Dominicks</HI> Library. The Country round about it and the neighbouring Hills are pleasant and delightfull, and doe yeeld good store of Corne, Wine, divers Fruits, Hearbes, Flowers, and all delicacies, both for necessity and pleasure. I omit many things concerning this Citty for brevity sake. There are also other Citties, as the old and new <HI>Capua,</HI> the ancient is knowne to all Latine Wri∣ters, and the beauty, fairenesse, and magnificence thereof is praised by all men. Great ruines thereof may be yet seene a mile from new <HI>Capua,</HI> neere S. <HI>Maries</HI> Church. New <HI>Capua</HI> was built out of the ruines of the old, which standeth now on the left banke of <HI>Vulturnus,</HI> 22. miles from the Sea, on a plaine well inhabited, but not much frequented: it hath straite streets paved with stone and high buildings, on the East and North the River <HI>Vulturnus</HI> doth water it, and from thence it run∣neth Westward. There is a faire stone bridge over the River. There is also <HI>Teanum</HI> surnamed <HI>Sidicinum,</HI> it is called in Italian <HI>Theano,</HI> and it is a Bishoprick.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Ow we must view the other part of the Kingdome of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> in which the first Country is that which the Italians doe call <HI>Puglia Piana,</HI> from the large spacious fields there of. It was heretofore called <HI>Apulia Daunia.</HI> It is bounded on the East with <HI>Apulia Peucetia,</HI> and the River <HI>Aufidus:</HI> on the South with the Apennine, together with the Hirpenians, and Samnites: on the West with the Frentanians, Caracenians, now cal∣led Aprutians, and Phiternians: on the North with the Hadriatick, and Jonium Sea. The soyle is very fruitfull, yeelding abundance of Wheate and Corne. Here are both Citties and Townes, as <HI>Manfre∣lonia,</HI> a faire and populous Citty, being situated on the banke of the Bay, which lyeth in the hollow winding of the Mountaine <HI>Garganus,</HI> and it hath an invincible Castle by the Shore side. <HI>Leuceria</HI> is an Epis∣copall Citty; which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> call <HI>Neuceria:</HI> the ruines yet remaining doe shew the spaciousnesse of it. <HI>Troy</HI> is a rich Citty, having a fruitfull Soyle about it. <HI>Asculum</HI> is a Citty, which is adorned with the Title of a Dukedome: <HI>Appianus Alexandrinus</HI> cal∣leth it <HI>Asculum,</HI> it is commonly called <HI>Asculo,</HI> and surnamed <HI>Sattriano.</HI> There are also <HI>Salpe,</HI> or <HI>Arpi,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> mentioneth, which was sometime called <HI>Argos Hippium,</HI> and afterward <HI>Agrippa:</HI> and two Cit∣ties, which became a Proverb, <HI>Apina</HI> and <HI>Trica, &amp;c.</HI> The Rivers are <HI>Aufidus,</HI> now called <HI>l'Ofanto.</HI> Also <HI>Candilaris,</HI> and <HI>Cervaria.</HI></P>
<P>So much concerning <HI>Apulia Daunia:</HI> the next Country which is to be described is <HI>Peucetia:</HI> now it is called in Italian, <HI>Terra Bariana,</HI> or <HI>Terra di Barri,</HI> from the chiefe Citty <HI>Bario.</HI> This Country for fertility of soyle, and plenty of choise fruit, may compare with other parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> But yet there are some places which are full of Boggs, and Wa∣ters. The chiefe Citty is <HI>Barium,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth <HI>Barion,</HI> it is com∣monly called <HI>Barri.</HI> It is an ancient Citty, and so faire and populous, that it is the chiefe Citty of the whole Country, which is called from thence <HI>Terra Bariana.</HI> There are also <HI>Monopolis,</HI> which is a new Citty adorned with the title of a Marquiship, which is not very great, but faire and beautifull, and full of magnificent Buildings. The soyle round about it yeeldeth great store of Oyle. <HI>Polonianum</HI> or <HI>Polignano</HI> is an Episcopall Citty, which although it bee seated on a high stony Rock, yet it is faire and populous. <HI>Mola</HI> hath many houses, but inha∣bited with rustick people.

shore, on high Rocks: <HI>Tranum</HI> is an Archiepiscopall Citty, common∣ly called <HI>Trani.</HI> It had faire Buildings, but now for the most part it is desolate. There are Woods of Olives and Almonds, which do reach from this Towne even to <HI>Tarentum. Barulum</HI> is commonly called <HI>Bar∣leta. Ostuna</HI> is a populous Citty, seated on a little Hill. <HI>Cilium,</HI> or <HI>Cilio,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Cilia,</HI> and <HI>Horace Venusia,</HI> or <HI>Venusium,</HI> where hee was borne, is now called <HI>Venesa.</HI> There are also <HI>Canusium, Acherontia, Biletum,</HI> and other Townes.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Apulia</HI> we must describe the Country of the Salentinians, which is also called <HI>Iapygia, Massapia,</HI> and <HI>Calabris.</HI> The Italians doe now commonly call it <HI>Terra d'Otranto.</HI> This Country hath on the South <HI>Tarentum,</HI> and the Sea even to the Salentinian Promontory: on the East the same Promontory, with the Jonian Sea: on the North it is watered with the River <HI>Hidruntes,</HI> even to <HI>Brundusium:</HI> on the West it hath <HI>Apulia, Peucetia,</HI> and a part of great <HI>Greece.</HI> This Country hath a wholesome ayre, and a cleere faire Climate except on that Coast, which reacheth from the Hydruntine Lake to <HI>Brundisium,</HI> where there are Marshes in those places which are neere the Sea. The Country is fatt and fruitfull, and the chiefe Citty which nameth the Country is <HI>Hydruntum,</HI> which <HI>Strabo, Ptolemy,</HI> and others doe call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar∣ous.

The soyle is pleasant and fruitfull. The other Citties are <HI>Gallipolis,</HI> now called <HI>Callipolis.</HI> Others call it <HI>Callipoli,</HI> as it were the faire Citty. It hath a strong situation: for it is seated on a Rock or small Iland, which is encompassed every where with the Sea, and it is joyned to the Continent with a stone Bridge. <HI>Castrum</HI> is a Citty much frequented by Merchants, who come thither to buy Oyle. <HI>Brundusium,</HI> or <HI>Brundisiam,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Breundesium, Steph.

It had heretofore a famous Haven, out of which the Romanes did formerly passe safely into <HI>Creece,</HI> but now it is filled up, so that a Galley can hardly come up into it. The Citty is fortified with a strong Castle. The Citty <HI>Oria</HI> is seated on a Hill looking toward <HI>Tarentum,</HI> and hath a strong Castle. That Towne which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Aletium,</HI> is now called <HI>Leze,</HI> and <HI>Leccie.</HI> It is the prime Citty of the Salentinians, in regard that the Royall Counsell of <HI>Apulia</HI> is held here, and because all the Nobility of this Country have houses here. <HI>Vxentem,</HI> now called <HI>Vgento, Vsenti,</HI> or <HI>Ogento,</HI> is a ve∣ry small Citty,</P>
<P><HI>Calabria</HI> is so called from the Calabrians, who as it appeares in <HI>Pto∣lemy,</HI> did possesse a part of great <HI>Greece</HI> from the Salentinians to the Jo∣nian Sea, about the Promontory <HI>Iapygium.</HI> It is a Country of <HI>Italy</HI> which being stretched foorth in the farthest borders thereof like a tongue, doth lye betweene the higher and lower Straites.

This Iland is hard to come unto, being enclosed on every side with inaccessible dangerous cliffes, and Hills. Within like∣wise it is for the most part Mountanous, and therefore it yeeldeth no great store of Wheate and Pulse; which grow but in some few pla∣ces, where the Country opens it selfe, and is watered with Rivers, which make it fruitfull. That part which looketh toward <HI>Etruria</HI> is in∣different plaine, having a fruitfull Soyle, which beareth excellent sweet fruites. This Iland hath excellent wines, of chiefe note, which the Romanes much esteemed, they are called from the place Corsican Wines. Here is great store of Honey, Rosen, Oyle, and Figges. But <HI>Servius</HI> noteth in his 4. Booke of Geogr. that the Corsian Honey is bitter, which comes to passe by reason that there are great store of Ewe trees, from whence the Bees doe gather Honey.

More∣over this Iland is full of sheepe and Oxen: It was heretofore inhabi∣ted by the Phocensians, then by the Ligurians, and afterward by the Romanes, who brought thither two Colonies, the Marian, and the Alerian, which doe still continew. The Barbarians possessed the rest: afterward when the Romanes invaded them, they brought a great Company of Slaves from thence to <HI>Rome,</HI> of which they made no great commodity, for they were such bruitish people, that albeit they were bought for a small price, yet their Masters repented them of their bargaine. After the Romanes the Sarazens succeeded, and after them the Geonoa's: then the Pisanians, and now it belongeth to <HI>Genoa.</HI> It is devided now into two parts: they call the Easterne part the inner∣most side, and the Westerne side the outermost side.

<HEAD>SARDINIA.</HEAD>
<P>SARDINIA was so named from <HI>Sardus</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Hercules.

Which <HI>Manilius</HI> intimateth when hee saith.</P>
<Q>Sardiniam in Lybico signant vestigia plantae.</Q>
<P>It is now called <HI>Sardegna.</HI> On the East the Tyrrhene Sea doth beate upon it, on the South the Affricke, on the West the Sardian; on the North the Sea that floweth betweene it and <HI>Corsica.</HI> This Iland hath an ungentle ayre: and therefore <HI>Q. F.</HI> doth admonish <HI>M. Cicero</HI> to have a care of his health, and to remember that although hee were now in health, yet hee was in <HI>Sardinia:</HI> and in his Epistles hee saith that one <HI>Sigellius</HI> a Sardinian was a man more pestilent and contagious than his Country. All the Iland aboundeth with fruite, Wheate, Wine, Mines of Silver, Cattell, and all things necessary. There are such store of Horses, that many runne wilde, and have no owners; they are les∣ser than ours, but full of mettall, strong and nimble. It affoordeth much Hunting, so that the Country people doe live onely by it. For this Country hath abundance of Boares, Harts, Does, and another kinde of Beast which they call <HI>Muflo,</HI> which we have described before in the description of <HI>Corsica.</HI> But <HI>Sardinia</HI> hath no Wolves, nor any other harmefull beast, nor Serpent, and therefore <HI>Silius</HI> saith.</P>

<L>This Country is from poysond Serpents free,</L>
<L>But many noysome Marshes in it bee.</L>

<P>But the Soligunda in <HI>Sardinia</HI> is as offensive and hurtfull as Ser∣pents are in other Countries. It is a little creature like a Spider. <HI>L.S.</HI> calleth it <HI>Solifuga,</HI> because it shunneth the day-light. It liveth much in the Silver Mines, for this soyle is very rich in Silver Oare. It cree∣peth closely along, and if any one sitt upon it unawares, it infecteth him. There is also a strange Sardinian Hearb, which <HI>Pausanias</HI> saith, is like unto Parsly: which if it bee eaten, it doth contract and draw together the Visage and mouth, so that they dye as it were laughing. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that the Spaniards make poison of it, which being drunke, doth dispatch them without any paine, and hence grew the Proverb <HI>Sardonius risus,</HI> or the Sardinian laughter. The chiefe Citty of <HI>Sardinia</HI> is <HI>Calaris,</HI> commonly called <HI>Cagler.</HI> It is situate on a Moun∣taine neere the Sea, looking toward <HI>Affrick,</HI> and it hath a faire Ha∣ven.

In this Citty the reliuqes of S. <HI>Augustine</HI> were kept, untill <HI>Heli∣prandus</HI> King of the Langbards did translate them to <HI>Papia.</HI> In this Cit∣ty the viceroy of <HI>Sardinia</HI> resideth, together with many Barons, Earles, and divers rich men. <HI>Mela</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> doe make mention of the Citty <HI>Sulchitana.</HI> There are now also the Citties <HI>Oristagnum,</HI> which is a Me∣tropolitan Citty, situate on a Plaine, not farre from the Sea. It was heretofore called the Country of trees, but now it is called the Mar∣quiship of <HI>Oristagnum.</HI> There is also the Citty <HI>Sassaris</HI> which hath a plea∣sant soyle watered with many Springs, &amp; abounding with divers sorts of fruites, but it is weakely fortified. <HI>Algher</HI> is a new small Citty, but yet populous and strong, and adorned with many faire aedifices and buil∣dings: the inhabitants whereof are almost all Tarraconians. <HI>Sardinia</HI> hath also other Citties, and Townes, which for brevitie sake wee o∣mit. It hath many pleasant Rivers which are not deepe, so that in sommer time you may passe over the bards. There are many Magi∣strates in <HI>Sardinia.</HI> The chiefe is the Viceroy, who hath al the Kings au∣thority: and according to their ancient lawes none but a Spaniard can beare this office. The King doth assigne and appoint him one as∣sistant, who is Doctor of both Lawes, whom they call there the Re∣gent. Moreover hee hath other Counsellors, who dispose and order all matters, and this Court is called the Kings audience. Heretofore it was a priviledge of the Kingdome that no man could beare this of∣fice longer than three yeres, and then another succeedeth in his place. But now one continueth in that office as long as the King pleaseth. Concerning the manners and dispositions of the Sadinians: they are strong of body, and inured to Labour, except it be some few who are given to effeminacy and wantonesse. Many of them doe keepe Cat∣tell, and are contented with poore fare and water. Those that dwell in the Townes and Villages, doe live peaceably and quietly together. They love strangers, and doe use them kindly. They live from hand to mouth, and goe in a poore habbit. And which is strange, there is not one Artificer in all the Iland, that can make either Swords, Daggers or other weapons, so that they fetch them out of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Mer∣cator mentioneth these Bishops.

For both Alpes Muskadine whence so called, that is Bees, and <HI>Muscae</HI> that is flies doe haunt these Grapes, which are therefore called Muskadine Grapes, out of which a sweet pleasant wine is pressed which they call Muskadine: though some suppose that it was so called because it smelleth like Muske. So that the Wine of <HI>Sicilie</HI> may be rightly esteemed the best, for it is as good as the Italian Wine, and as pleasing to the Pallat, and will keepe as long. Moreover <HI>Sicilie</HI> hath great store of Oyle, Suger, Saffron, Ho∣ney, Salt, all sorts of fruites, and excellent Silke. Besides <HI>Sicilie</HI> is rich in Mettalls: for it hath Gold, Silver, Iron, and Allom. It produceth also Pretious stones, as the Emerald, the Achates, the Berill, the red Marble stone, the Iasper, and it hath great heards and flocks of Ox∣en and Cattell.

The greater Church of this Citty is of a kind of a networke building, carved with divers figures and Images, and built by <HI>Gualther</HI> the second Archbishop of that name, which was founded in the yeare 1185. where the bodies of the Kings, and Queenes, and Dukes are buried and interr'd. There is also a publike Schoole, and an Hospitall for strangers. It would be tedious to rehearse the other faire buil∣dings, and aedifices which are in this Citty.

Where a part of the Towne, which is called the Ile, being disjoyned by their meeting together, with a straite Sea, is joyned together againe with a Bridge.

There are many Churches in it, but especi∣ally two, which doe farre exceede the rest, one consecrate to <HI>Diana,</HI> and the other to <HI>Minerva,</HI> which was a faire Church before <HI>Verres</HI> came thither. In the farthest part of the Iland, there is a Fountaine of sweet water, which is called <HI>Arethusa,</HI> which is very great, and full of fish, which would be coverd with the waves of the Sea, but that it is walled about with stones.

There is a third Citty which is called <HI>Tyche,</HI> in which there is a great Schoole, and many Churches, and it is well inhabited and frequented. The fourth Citty is that which because it was last built, is called <HI>Neapolis,</HI> or the new Citty, in which there is a great Theater, &amp; two great Churches, one consecrate to <HI>Ceres,</HI> and another to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and a faire Statue of <HI>Apollo,</HI> which is called <HI>Tennites.</HI> But not all the beauty of this Citty is decayd, and onely some ruinous parts of the Towne are remaining. <HI>Messana</HI> is a Citty by the Sea side, the Inhabitants whereof were first called Messanians, and afterward Mamertinians, which <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Thucydides</HI> doe mention. There is also <HI>Catina,</HI> which is called <HI>Catana,</HI> where <HI>Charonda</HI> the Lawmaker was borne, and it hath now a famous Schoole. <HI>Taurominium</HI> is a Citty built by the Zanclaeans, it is now cal∣led <HI>Taormina.</HI> There is also <HI>Leontium,</HI> where <HI>Gorgias Sophista</HI> was borne. <HI>Agrigentum</HI> is an ancient Citty, which heretofore the Carthaginians raced, and <HI>Megalus</HI> and <HI>Feriscus</HI> re-edified it againe.

And they had Tutelary gods for every affection of the minde, and for defence and protection from danger, and every god had distinct and peculiar Ceremonies, Prayers, Priests, Sacrifices, and Offerings. The com∣mon people doe not now keepe their ancient fashions. For they let their haire grow long, and doe onely cut the forepart of their haire, and doe weare a double thicke Hat. They use but little houshold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ffe as the Turkes: neither doe they lye on Fether-beds, but on Flock-beds, or Beds stuffed with Wooll or Toe. They never mingle any wine with water, and women are not present at their drinking feasts and meetings, neither doe they sitt doWne at Banquets. But the Heathenish Greekes have an ancient custome in bewailing the dead. The Greeke Christians doe differ in Religion from the Romanes, and doe call themselves the Easterne Church. They have foure Patriarks, the Patriarches of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and <HI>An∣tioch.</HI> These are created by the Metropolitan Bishops, as the Popes are by the Cardinals, and they are famous for their sanctimonious, ho∣ly, modest, and religious life. Their yeerely revenue is 400. crownes, which is begged in the Churches which are under their government. For the Clergie men have no Inheritance. They may marry one wife, but no more, they acknowledge onely two Sacraments, Bap∣tisme and the Lords Supper. They communicate in both kindes, both in Bread and Wine. They hate Purgatory, and detest graven Images, and doe not shave their haire. But the richer Graecians, and men of Authority, doe weare Princely apparell. Those that are under the Venetians doe goe in habit like to Venetians. Those that are under the Turkes, doe goe like Turkes. The Governour of <HI>Greece</HI> is called <HI>Vromeli Beglerbey,</HI> that is, King of the Romane Princes, for hee gover∣neth all those Countries which the Turke hath in <HI>Europe,</HI> which are subject to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Hee hath 40. Sangiacks, under him, who are Captaines of the Horse troopes chosen out of the Spachoglans, and they are Governours in the chiefe Citties of the Provinces, to keepe them in peace and obedience, and they have 150. <HI>Sobasci Cimmeriotae,</HI> or more, who are Vice-governours under them of lesser Townes.

<HEAD>MOREA, HEERETOFORE CALLED <HI>PELOPONNESƲS.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O much concerning the chief Countries of <HI>Greece,</HI> which are in the Continent: <HI>Morea</HI> and <HI>Candia</HI> are next to be unfolded. The former <HI>Ptolemy, Srabo,</HI> and <HI>Steph.</HI> doe call <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> it is a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> but now it is happily called <HI>Morea</HI> from the incursions of the Moores. Heretofore as <HI>Apollodorus</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> doe witnesse, it was called <HI>Apia</HI> and <HI>Pelasgia. Strabo</HI> delivers that it was <HI>Argos,</HI> and afterward <HI>Argos Achaicum;</HI> and <HI>Orosius Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 11. saith that it was called <HI>Achaja.</HI> And also <HI>Apule∣jus</HI> in his 6. Booke of the golden Asse. <HI>Eustathius</HI> did also call it <HI>Pelopia,</HI> and <HI>Stephanus Inachia.</HI> And in <HI>Eusebius</HI> Chronicle it is called <HI>Aegialia.</HI> It was called <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> from <HI>Pelops</HI> a barbarous man, who comming out of <HI>Asia</HI> raigned here. For <HI>Pelopis</HI> signifies an Iland, whereas it is not an Iland, but a Peninsula. and as <HI>Mela</HI> writeth it is most like to a Plantine leafe, being as broad as long. The Perimeter or compasse of it is 4000. Furlongs, unto which <HI>Artemedorus</HI> addeth 400. It is joy∣ned to the continent by an Isthmus or necke of Land, the breadth whereof is 40. Furlongs. Many have vainely attempted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thorow this narrow tongue of ground, as <HI>Demetrius, C. Caesar, Caligula, Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and others: but being frustrated of their purpose, they made a wall there which they called <HI>Hexamilium. Amurath</HI> the Turke threw it downe, and the Venetians re-edified it in the yeere 1453. in 15. dayes space, but the Turkes afterward did raze it downe to the ground. In this Isthmus there was heretofore the Temple of <HI>Neptune,</HI> where the Isth∣mian sports and Playes were celebrated. <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> hath on the East the Cretian Sea: on the West the Jonian or Hadriatick Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the North it hath the Corinthian and Saronick Bay, betweene which is the Isthmus: on the South it hath the Mediterranean Sea. This Pe∣ninsula is the Castle and chiefe part of all <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that it is not inferiour to any Country. For it hath plenty, and abundance of all things which serve rather for pleasure or necessity. It hath fruitful Plaines and Hills, and it is full of Bayes and Havens which doe make many Promontories. The Elians, the Messenians, the Achivi, the Sicyonians, the Corinthians, the Laconians, the Argives, and the Arcadians did heretofore inhabite <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> And this part of <HI>Greece</HI> was famous heretofore thorow the whole world for the Common∣wealths of the Myceneans, Argives, Lacedemonians, Sicyonians, Eli∣ensians, Arcadians, Pylions, and Messenions, out of which there came many famous Princes, as <HI>Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ajax,</HI> and others. For this Country in regard of the situation, and Majesty thereof did governe all the other parts of <HI>Greece.</HI> But now all <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> is under

But now a Sangiack doth governe all <HI>Morea</HI> under the Turke, who is more potent than all the rest, who resideth at <HI>Modonum,</HI> and at the <HI>Beglerbeys</HI> of all <HI>Greeces</HI> command hee is to bring a thousand Horse into the Field at his owne cost and char∣ges. This Sangiack is called by the Barbarians <HI>Morabegi,</HI> whose yeere∣ly revenewes in this Province 700000. Aspers, that is, 14. thousand Crownes. But it appeareth in <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and other Authors, that all this Country was devided into 8. Provinces, which are <HI>Corinth, Argia, La∣conia, Messenia, Elis, Achaja, Sicyonis,</HI> and <HI>Arcadia. Corinth</HI> is seated in the Isthmus, it was so denominate from the chiefe Citty which was first called <HI>Ephyre. Cicero</HI> doth worthily call it the light of <HI>Greece.</HI> It hath a Haven on either side, the one whereof looketh toward <HI>Asia,</HI> the other toward <HI>Italy,</HI> so that the convenient situation made it soone grow famous, and the Isthmian Playes which were celebrated here. <HI>Acrocorinthe</HI> was seated on a Mountaine 3. Furlongs and a halfe high, and under it was <HI>Corinth</HI> 40. Furlongs in compasse. On the top of the Mountaine there was a temple dedicated to <HI>Venus:</HI> neere which was the Fountaine <HI>Pyrene,</HI> which did first spring up as the Poets report, from a stroke of <HI>Pegasus</HI> his hoofe, who was the winged Horse of the Muses. This Citty was raz'd by <HI>L. Mummius,</HI> because they had dis∣courteously entertained the Romane Embassadours, after it had beene builded 952. yeeres by <HI>Aletes</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Hippotes,</HI> as you may finde it in <HI>Paterculus. Argia</HI> followeth, which <HI>Ortelius</HI> calleth <HI>Romania.</HI> The Citties of this Country are <HI>Mycenae,</HI> where <HI>Agamemnon</HI> had his Palace, whence <HI>Ovid</HI> calleth it <HI>Agamemnons Mycenae,</HI> it was famous for the an∣cient temple of <HI>Iuno,</HI> whence <HI>Iuno</HI> was called <HI>Argiva.</HI> They report that the Cyclops did wall it about. Not farre from hence was the Lake <HI>Lerna,</HI> where <HI>Hercules</HI> kild the <HI>Lernaean Hydra,</HI> or rather did scat∣ter and kill the Theeves that did rob in those parts. The Citty <HI>Argos</HI> was built as some report by <HI>Argus. Nauplia</HI> now called <HI>Neapolis</HI> is a strong Citty of <HI>Romania, Epidaurus</HI> is in the innermost part of the Sa∣ronian Bay, a Citty famous for <HI>Esculapius</HI> temple. Next to <HI>Argia</HI> is <HI>Laconia.</HI> The Metropolis or Mother Citty whereof is <HI>Sparta,</HI> which was also called <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> and now <HI>Misuhra:</HI> it was heretofore a great potent Citty, being not fortified with walls, but by the valour of the Cittizens, neither doth <HI>Pomponius</HI> praise it for magnificent Buildings, but for <HI>Licurgus</HI> his Lawes and Discipline, in which it con∣tended with <HI>Athens,</HI> as <HI>Thucidides</HI> noteth in his 8. Booke. <HI>Leuctra</HI> may be knowne out of <HI>Plutarch</HI> by that sad and tragicall History of <HI>Sceda∣sus</HI> Daughters. There is also <HI>Epidaurus</HI> which is now called <HI>Malvasia. Messenia</HI> reacheth from the Mountaine <HI>Taygetus</HI> and the River <HI>Panijsus</HI> even to <HI>Alpheus.</HI> The chiefe Citty of it is <HI>Messene</HI> situate by the Sea, it is now called <HI>Mattegia. Aristomenis</HI> was the Country where renow∣ned <HI>Messenius</HI> was borne, who as <HI>Pausanias</HI> reporteth, being ripped o∣pen after he was dead, had a hairy Heart. There is also <HI>Methone,</HI> now called <HI>Modon,</HI> where the Turkish Sangiack did sometimes keepe his residence. <HI>Corone</HI> is now called <HI>Coron. Pilus</HI> was the Country, where

<HI>Homers</HI> eloquent <HI>Nestor</HI> who lived three ages, was borne. And <HI>Cipa∣rissi</HI> is now called <HI>Arcadia.

Afterward <HI>Phidius</HI> the Athenian did sett up a great Image of <HI>Iupiter</HI> of Gold and Ivory, being 60. foote high, which worke was reprehended by other Artificers, because the Image was not proportionable to the Temple. For whereas this <HI>Iupiter</HI> sate in an Ivory Throne, and yet touched the top of the Church with his head, it must needs come to passe that if this Ivory god being weary of sitting would rise up at any time, that hee must throw downe the top of the Church. There is also <HI>Pisa. Achaja</HI> which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calleth <HI>Propria,</HI> reacheth from the Promontory <HI>Arax∣as,</HI> even to the Sicyonian, from whom it is devided by the River <HI>Sus,</HI> on the South it hath the Mountaine <HI>Stymphalus,</HI> on the North the Co∣rinthian Bay. There are also the Citties <HI>Dyme,</HI> which they now call <HI>Charenza,</HI> whence they call the Araxean Promontory <HI>Capo di Chiaren∣za</HI> there is also the famous Citty <HI>Patrae</HI> which is now called <HI>Patras.</HI> The Citty <HI>Aegium</HI> in former time was called <HI>Vostiza</HI> or <HI>Bostizan,</HI> and it was raced by the Turkes. <HI>Aegira</HI> was heretofore a chiefe Citty, being seated on a rugged steepe Hill, which is now ruinate, and called <HI>Xilo∣castro.</HI> And in the Crissaean Bay there are <HI>Helice, Bura,</HI> and <HI>Pellene.

But now, as <HI>Bellonius</HI> reporteth by the instinct of na∣ture, they delight from their child-hood in the Scythian Bow, and therein doe follow their ancient custome. For they report that they heretofore adored <HI>Diana:</HI> and therefore they exceeded the Turkes themselves for shooting, also they are nimble and stout in Sea-fights. For the Cretensians were the first that were strong in Shipping, and Bowes, whereby it is to be understood that they were the first Graeci∣ans that followed these studies.

<P><HI>Corfu</HI> which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Corcira</HI> is a faire Iland, being strong both by Land and Sea. It is 2. miles distant from <HI>Epirus,</HI> where the Sea is straitest, but where it is broadest 20. miles. It is 97. paces in length, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witnesseth. The Climate is very temperate and gentle. so that there are whole woods of Citterne Trees, Orange Trees, and those kindes of fruits. The soyle is fruitfull, having abundance of Vines, Olives, Apples, and other sorts of fruits, here is also great store of Honey. But it hath no good Corne in regard of the Southerne windes, which dryes it so much, that it withers before it come to Ma∣turity and ripenesse. It is now subject to the Venetians, who defended it valiantly against the fury of the Turkes. It hath a Citty of the same name. The Inhabitants are Graecians.</P>

This Iland bringeth forth great store of Corne, but especially Raisons, Wine, and Oyle, out of which the Inhabitants doe yeerely make 150000. Crownes. They are Graecians and subject to the Venetians. It hath a Towne of the same name, with a Castle seated on a Mountaine, which hangeth over the Sea: it is full of Woods, and it is much commended for the

<P><HI>Milo</HI> is an Iland which was anciently called <HI>Melos,</HI> which is in the Cretian Sea. The compasse of it is 80. miles. It hath fruitfull Fields, which doe yeeld Corne and Oyle, but little Wine. In this Iland a Mine of Silver is also found, and the Onix stone.</P>
<P><HI>Naxus</HI> is an Iland which <HI>Sophianus</HI> and others call <HI>Nissia.</HI> It is 80. miles in compasse. And it is reckoned among the fruitfull Iles. It hath great store of Wine, and there is a kinde of Marble found in it, which the Graecians and <HI>Pliny</HI> doe call a Carbell, having spots like a Serpent. The stone also <HI>Smirillus</HI> wherewith Glasiers cut their Glasse, which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Smiris</HI> is found here. Some thinke that there are veynes of Gold here, which are not found out by reason of the Inha∣bitants sloth and idlenesse. Here is also a kinde of Waspe, which if it sting any one, he dyeth presently afterward: also here are great store of Bats. It was heretofore subject to <HI>Iohn Quirinus</HI> a noble Venetian. Afterward to Duke <HI>Iob Crispus,</HI> whom <HI>Selinus</HI> the Turkish Emperour drove hence. But now it is inhabited by Turkes and Iewes.</P>

It is fruitfull and hath convenient Havens. The In∣habitants live by fishing. And it is subject to the Turke.</P>
<P><HI>Scarpanto</HI> was heretofore called <HI>Carpathus,</HI> or according to <HI>Homer, Cra∣pathus.</HI> Hence the Carpathian Sea. It is situate in the middle between <HI>Crete</HI> and <HI>Rhodes.</HI> The compasse of it is 60. miles, or as some will have it 70 miles. It is rugged and full of Mountaines, in which there are Mines of Marble. It had heretofore foure Citties, and therefore it was called <HI>Tetrapolis,</HI> as <HI>Eustathius</HI> hath it upon <HI>Homer.</HI> It hath many Havens which are not very great, nor safe. The Inhabitants speake Greeke, and doe embrace the Graecian Religion: but they are subject to the Venetians.</P>

The King∣dome of <HI>Teleusinum</HI> which they call <HI>Tremisen,</HI> is <HI>Mauritania Caesariensis.</HI> The length of it from the West to the East is 380. miles. The breadth of it is narrower being 25. miles, namely, from the Desarts of <HI>Numi∣dia,</HI> even to the Mediterranean Sea. The most part of this Country is unhabited, dry, and rugged, especially Southward. But the Coasts by the Sea side are somewhat more fruitfull and fertile. There are few Citties or Castles in it. The Metropolis is <HI>Teleusina,</HI> which was heretofore a great Citty, but now it is for the most part ruinated. In the same Country there is also <HI>Algiers,</HI> a great Citty and well forti∣fied. This Citty did first revolt from the King of <HI>Telusianum,</HI> and paide tribute to the King of <HI>Bugia:</HI> afterward it revolted from him and re∣ceived <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Spaine</HI> to be their King.

large, it is bounded on the West with the Rivers <HI>Servi</HI> and <HI>Omirabih,</HI> on the South it joyneth to the Mountaine <HI>Atlas,</HI> on the North it is bounderd with the confluence and meeting of the Rivers <HI>Servi</HI> and <HI>Omirabih,</HI> so that the Country lyeth in a triangular or three cornerd figure. There are some Townes in it, the chiefe whereof is <HI>Tesza,</HI> built by the Affricans, and well inhabited. There are also <HI>Esza, Githi∣teb,</HI> and others. The chiefe Rivers of this Kingdome are <HI>Tensift,</HI> and <HI>Omirabih,</HI> which issuing out of the Mountaine <HI>Atlas,</HI> doe runne into the Ocean. But <HI>Tensift</HI> riseth in the Country of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and is en∣larged by the receit of many Rivers, the greatest whereof are <HI>Sifel∣mel</HI> and <HI>Niffis.</HI> But <HI>Omirabih</HI> doth breake forth among the Moun∣taines, where the Province of <HI>Tedles</HI> confineth on the Kingdome of <HI>Fesse.</HI> On the shore side in some places there is found great store of Amber, which is very cheape there, so that the Portugals and other forraigne Nations doe transport it into other Countries. Here are many Mountaines, as <HI>Nisipha, Semede, Sensana,</HI> and others. The most whereof are cold and barren, so that they beare nothing but Barley. In this Kingdome there are no great store of Churches, Colledges, nor Hospitals. In the Citty of <HI>Morocco</HI> there are many Churches, and one of the most curious and magnificent is that which standeth in the middle of the Citty, and was built by the aforesaid <HI>Halis.</HI> There is also another built by his successor <HI>Abdul Miomem,</HI> and enlarged by his Ne∣phew <HI>Monsor,</HI> and enriched which many Pillars brought thither out of <HI>Spaine.</HI> He made a Cisterne under this Church, which is as bigge as the Church, he coverd the Church with Lead, and made leaden Pipes at every corner, to receive and convay the raine water into the afore∣said Cisterne. The Tower or Steeple of stone like unto <HI>Vespasians</HI> Ro∣mane Amphitheater, is higher than the Steeple of <HI>Bononta</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> the steps which goe up into it are very broad, and the walls thick. This Tower hath three Belfries or Turrets, on which there is another lit∣tle arched Tower built. And this hath three Turrets one over ano∣ther, and they goe from one to another by a wodden Laddet. If any one looke downe from the highest Tower he will thinke that men of great stature are no bigger than children of a yeere old. And this Tower hath a golden Moone for a Weathercock, and three golden Globes, so fastned upon Iron, that the greatest is placed lowest, and the lesser highest. There is also a strong Castle in this Citty so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
