<P>TO THE

Sir <HI>Joseph Williamson</HI>
KNIGHT,
ONE OF HIS

Principal Secretaries
of STATE,
AND
Of his most Honourable

<P>These Observations of Travels in <HI>Turkey</HI> are

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT had been a matter of no great
difficulty to have presented
you, instead of this short Essay,
with a large Volume, if I had
either affected or designed, when I
first took my pen in hand, to have
written a full history of the Reli∣gion,
Manners and Government of
the <HI>Turks,</HI> or had tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght fit to
have stuffed these M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>moires with
accompts of things trivial and com∣mon,
which have been said too often
already and which are to be met
with in every little Relation. But
I was not in the least tempted to
such a piece of vanity and ostenta∣tion:
<PB REF="4"/>
and indeed I thought it very
much beneath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne to do this; espe∣cially
when I reflected I was wri∣ting
Letters to an <HI>Excellent Person,</HI>
who by his studies and travels, and
many honourable employments both
at home and in forrain parts had ac∣quired
a perfect knowledge of the
state of affairs, not only of <HI>Christen∣dom,</HI>
but also of all other remoter
Countries; and who deserved to be
treated with greater respect and ce∣remony,
by me especially, that owe
the opportunity I gained of travelling
into the <HI>Levant</HI> to his most obliging
and effectual recommendation. So that
brevity was my choice, and I was of∣tentimes
more sollicitous and concer∣ned
to consider what not then what
to write. That I have done what
I proposed to my self, and have made
good my pretensions, neither my fears
nor my modesty will permit me to
be over-confident: But I have this,
I will not say to justifie, but to ex∣cuse
at least my presumption and for∣wardness,
that if I had known these
things to have been satisfactorily
<PB REF="4"/>
accompted for by others, I should
not have troubled either my self or
you. These accompts, which upon
my return home to <HI>Oxon</HI> I published
there in <HI>Latine,</HI> I am in a manner
necessitated to translate into <HI>English,</HI>
tho with some few enlargements, to
prevent the doing of it by another,
which I had just reason to appre∣hend.
For a worthy person, who has
often condescended to this kind of
drudgery for the publick benefit,
was so just and civil, as to ask my
leave to do it; which I did not
think fit to grant: but whether for
the better or the worse I must not
say.</P>
<P>If the thread of a <HI>Church-man</HI>
be perceived to run through the
whole Relation, I hope this will be
so far from being a just exception or
prejudice to it, that it may gain
some little credit and reputation
with you upon that accompt; if
not the performance, the design at
least, I easily perswade my self will
not be disallowed. It is not only to
gratifie your curiosity, but to serve
<PB REF="5"/>
you in better and nobler ends;
whereof this is the chiefest, that
being more and more convinced by
such kind of relations, of the brutish
ignorance and horrid barbarousness
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and of the dotages
and follies of their worship, you may
the more thankfully and seriously re∣flect
upon that most blessed and mer∣ciful
providence, which has cast
your lot in <HI>Christendom,</HI> and in a
Countrey especially, where the <HI>Chri∣stian
Doctrine</HI> is profest in its pri∣mitive
purity and integrity, and
where civility and learning, and all
ingenuous Arts flourish, and are in
their heigth and perfection.</P>
<P>The accompt of my voyage to the
<HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> all but the begin∣ing
and end, I wrote in <HI>Smyrna</HI> out
of my Diary, for the satisfaction of
my fellow-travellers, who were plea∣sed
to demand Copies of me. And I
hope what I have done in this kind
will not in the least hinder any of
those worthy and ingenious persons,
who have made the same <HI>tour</HI> before
or since, from publishing their Jour∣nals:
<PB REF="5"/>
this argument being capable
of continual enlargements, especi∣ally
in the matter of <HI>Inscriptions.</HI>
This would be of very great advan∣tage
to learning, of which there can∣not
possibly be a greater proof than
in those marbles which were
brought out of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the <HI>lesser
Asia</HI> at the expence of that great
man, <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and
which by the most generous favour
of the illustrious, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of
<HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Earl Marshal,</HI> now
serve to adorn the <HI>area</HI> about the
<HI>Theater</HI> at <HI>Oxon:</HI> and especially the
<HI>Parian</HI> marble, which contains the
most famous Epochas of the ancient
<HI>Greeks,</HI> by the help of which many
difficulties in <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Chronolo∣gy</HI>
have been cleared; as Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Lydiat,</HI> the right Reverend and
most profoundly learned, the present
<HI>Lord Bishop</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> the most ac∣complisht
<HI>Sir John Marsham,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> the learned Publisher
of the <HI>Marmora Oxoniensia</HI> have
shewn in several instances. And of
what great use several other inscrip∣tions
<PB REF="6"/>
are, for the adjusting and
settling the accompts of time, and
rectifying the <HI>Fasti Consulares,</HI> will
better appear, when the Reverend
and most judiciously learned Doctor
<HI>William Lloyd</HI> Dean of <HI>Bangor</HI> shall
think fit to publish those things of
this kind, which he has been pleased to
shew me in his Collections. An in∣credible
number of marbles still re∣main
behind in those parts, and
others are continually dug up, (the
erecting of these having been former∣ly
the pride and gallantry of the
<HI>Greeks</HI>) and what might be pur∣chased
upon no very hard terms, if
some excellent persons would be at
the expence of enriching their Coun∣trey
with the spoils of the <HI>East.</HI> I
have often lamented the misfortune,
which drove me from <HI>Hierapolis</HI>
after the short stay of two or three
hours, where I believe I could have
employed my self for a week or fort∣night
to very good purpose: and that
neither my necessary attendance npon
the Ambassador and the Nation, nor
my small stock of money afterward,
<PB REF="6"/>
when I was at liberty, would per∣mit
me to travel to <HI>Nice, Nicome∣dia,
Ancyra, Iconium,</HI> and several
other places, where I heard were
numerous and famous ruines;
but especially to <HI>Monte Santo,</HI> as
they call <HI>Mount Athos,</HI> to look af∣ter
<HI>Greek Manuscripts.</HI> But I hope
other Travellers will be more fortu∣nate,
and better encouraged than I
have been, and will one day make
the world happy with their disco∣veries,
and receive the reward of
their generous adventures and un∣dertakings,
when <HI>God</HI> shall restore
them to their native Countrey.</P>
<P>Lastly, I have added a short de∣scription
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which
I readily acknowledge to be far
from accurate and perfect, not de∣signing
in the least, when I was
upon the place, to have done any
such thing; and therefore I content∣ed
my self only to put down some
short notices to relieve my memory.
I soon was made sensible, by passing
up and down the streets of that great
City, that the scite and sceleton, if I
<PB REF="7"/>
may use the word, of the ancient
buildings only remains, the beauty
and glory of them being lost, since
the <HI>Turks</HI> became Masters of it:
And as when I was at the <HI>Churches</HI>
(an idea of which they may easily
have, who have seen the Abbey of
<HI>Glastenbury</HI> or <HI>Thetford,</HI> or will
but call to mind the deplorable ru∣ines
of <HI>London</HI> after the dismal fire)
so when I considered the present state
and condition of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> I
was oftentimes perplext and in
doubt, whether I was more to ad∣mire
the piety and munificence of
those, who raised such stately and
glorious structures, or the brutish∣ness
and barbarousness of those, who
pulled them down. But I soon laid
my hand upon my mouth, when I
further considered, that sacriledge
had done the like to several goodly
houses of Religion and Learning in
<HI>Christendom,</HI> and that it was wholly
owing to the miraculous providence
of <HI>God,</HI> who laid a restraint upon
the mad and impious zeal of some
of the prevailing faction in the late
<PB REF="7"/>
times of usurpation, (when the re∣venue
of the Church became a prey
to their covetousness) that the <HI>Ca∣thedrals,</HI>
which are the wonder of
all ingenious forrainers, and one of
the standing glorys of <HI>England,</HI> had
not been laid wast and levelled
with the ground, and turned into
confused heaps of stone and rubbish,
like <HI>Ephesus</HI> or <HI>Laodecea.</HI> A reflexion
upon which sad times should make us
detest those seditious and fanatical
principles, which if they should once
prevail, and be received as good
<HI>Christian Doctrine,</HI> as they were
most unhappily not many years since,
we have just reason to fear they
would bring as great desolations
along with them as any that are
now in <HI>Turkey.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS upon the
MANNERS, RELIGION,
and GOVERNMENT of
the TURKS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Turks</HI> are justly
branded with the cha∣racter
of a Barbarous
Nation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> in what quali∣fied sense Barbarous.</NOTE> which censure
does not relate either
to the cruelty and severity of their
punishments, which their natural
fierceness, not otherwise to be re∣strain'd,
renders necessary and essen∣tial
to their Government; or to
want of Discipline, for that in most
things is very exact, and agreeable
to the Laws and Rules of Polity,
which Custom and Experience hath
established as the grand support
of their Empire; or to want of ci∣vil
Behaviour among themselves,
for none can outwardly be more
respectful and submissive, especially
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
to their Superiors, in whose power
it is to do them a mischief, the fear
of which makes them guilty of most
base compliances: But to the into∣lerable
Pride and Scorn wherewith
they treat all the World besides.</P>
<P>Their Temper and Genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their con∣tempt of Learning.</NOTE> the
Constitution of their Government,
and the Principles of their Educa∣tion
enclining them to War, where
Valour and Merit are sure to be en∣couraged,
and have their due re∣ward;
They have neither leisure
nor inclination to entertain the stu∣dies
of Learning or the Civil Arts,
which take off the roughness and
wildness of nature, and render men
more agreeable in their conversati∣on.
And though they are forced to
commend and admire the ingenuity
of the <HI>Western Christians,</HI> when they
see any Mathematical Instrument,
curious Pictures, Map, or Sea-Charts,
or open the Leaves of any Printed
Book, or the like; yet they look upon
all this as a curiosity, that not only
may be spared, but what ought to be
carefully avoided, and kept out of
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
their Empire, as tending to soften
mens minds, and render them less
fit for Arms, which they look upon
as the best and truest end of life, to
enlarge their Greatness and their
Conquests.</P>
<P>But it is not so much their want
of true and ingenuous Learning,
which makes them thus intractable
and rude to Strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hatred of all other Religions, which is</NOTE> as a rooted
and inveterate prejudice against, and
hatred of all others who are of a
different Religion. It is not to be ex∣pected,
that where this principle pre∣vails,
and is look'd upon as a piece
of Religion and Duty, they who em∣brace
it should be guilty of any act
of kindness and humanity; except
when they are bribed to it with hope
of reward and gain, or forced to it
by the necessities of state, or wrought
upon more powerfully, as it were a∣gainst
their wills by the resentments
of some favours and kindnesses re∣ceiv'd,
which may happen now and
then in some of better natures and
more generous tempers.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
How mean and contemptible
thoughts and opinions soever we
have of any,<NOTE PLACE="marg">a principle of their Re∣ligion, and</NOTE> yet common huma∣nity
obligeth us to restrain and keep
them in from breaking out in scur∣rilous
and reproachful language, espe∣cially
when there is no provocation;
but the rude malice of the <HI>Turks</HI>
scorns to submit to these general
rules of civility, who are so far from
being sensible of the indecency of it,
that they triumph and glory in it,
as if it were not only an act of bra∣very
and gallantry, but a just proof
of their zeal, and most becoming
and worthy a <HI>Musulman.</HI></P>
<P>This hatred they are very care∣ful
to instil into their Children from
their very infancy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of their E∣ducation.</NOTE> as a most ne∣cessary
part of their Education, next
to the belief of one God, and of
<HI>Mahomed</HI> his Apostle and Messen∣ger.
I must profess, it raised my
wonder oftentimes to see little Boys,
whose tender age seemed no way ca∣pable
of such resentments, upon the
sight of <HI>Franks</HI> (for by that gene∣ral
name they most confusedly call
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
the <HI>Western Christians</HI>) passing by,
to leave their sport and play, and
with great vehemency of passion,
and with a fury above that of Chil∣dren,
exclaim upon them, and not
satisfied with this, throw stones at
them, with a most strange and seri∣ous
concern, upbraiding them with
their infidelity, as if they had learn∣ed
nothing else from their Parents.</P>
<P>This is the general civility of the
<HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their be∣haviour to∣ward Chri∣stians.</NOTE> who vouchsafe us no other
title when they speak of us in their
ordinary discourse, when they seem
most calm and mild, when their zeal
and malice does not boil over in fu∣ry
and madness, then that of <HI>Gaour,</HI>
or <HI>Infidel;</HI> and to disgrace and de∣ride
us the more, they usually pre∣face
it with some obscene words,
which are now grown a common
mode of speech among them, and
so frequent in their mouths, that up∣on
any the slightest accident that
crosseth them, if a stone that lies
in their way does offend them, if
their Horses are unruly or do but
stumble, if their Buffaloes and Asses
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
trip or stand still, they vent their
passion and displeasure in the same
beastly language. When their passi∣on
swels and rages, and prompts
them to shew a higher degree of con∣tempt
and hatred of us, then <HI>bre
Domuz, you Hog,</HI> is the word; (the
very mention of which adds to their
disorder, and gives their blood a new
fermentation) ranking us with those
impure Creatures, which they ac∣count
so execrable, (as if we were e∣qually
impure), and from whose
sight and touch when they are alive,
and no less from the taste of their
flesh, they so carefully and religi∣ously
abstain. We are not yet ar∣rived
at the height of their rudeness
and barbarity; this is not the worst
reproach and abuse they put upon
us; it is not enough they think to
compare and rank us with Beasts,
unless they pronounce us <HI>Devils</HI>
too; and maintain with great noise
and confidence, that we stink in
the Nostrils of <HI>God Almighty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
In Cities, and places of Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians only secure in places of Trade;</NOTE>
where Merchants reside, there is pro∣vision
made by capitulations and ar∣ticles,
accorded by the <HI>Grand Signor</HI>
to their respective Soveraigns, for
the security of their persons and e∣state,
which interest alone makes
them submit to. For as dull and as
heavy as they are, they are mighty
sensible of the benefit and advantage
they receive by foreign Trade. They
themselves not caring to traffick out
of their own Empire, either out of
a principle of pride, as if there were
more of state in it, that all sorts of
Merchandises are brought to their
doors, without their seeking or fetch∣ing;
or of laziness and fear, not
willing nor daring to undergo the
hazards and fatigues of Sea-voyages;
or for want of skill in the art of Na∣vigation,
in which they are very
blockheads and bunglers, confessing,
that <HI>God</HI> has given both the know∣ledg
and command of the waters to
the Christians; all which added to
the natural dread and aversion they
have of the Sea, make them con∣tent
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
themselves for the most part
with the Trade of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
sailing for the most part <HI>terra terra,</HI>
or of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the great Scale
and Port of <HI>Caire,</HI> and the other
parts of <HI>Egypt</HI> which lye toward
the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> though often∣times
molested in the one by the
<HI>Cossacks,</HI> who in times of war come
down the <HI>Borysthenes</HI> with their
Fleet of Boats, and thence coast all
along to the very mouth of the <HI>Bos∣phorus,</HI>
as by the <HI>Malteses</HI> in the
other. And I am induced to believe,
by arguments of very great proba∣bility,
that if the Trade of <HI>Christen∣dom</HI>
were wholly interrupted by
wars, and the Silk-trade particularly
diverted and turned out of the Do∣minions
of the <HI>Turk,</HI> either by the
way of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, or which
would be more feisible, by lading
it at <HI>Gombroon,</HI> and so joined to the
<HI>Indian</HI> Trade, (both which projects
were mightily approved of by <HI>Ab∣bas</HI>
that victorious King of <HI>Persia,</HI>
and great enemy of the <HI>Turks</HI>), to
avert so great a mischief, they would
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
quickly vail their <HI>Turbants,</HI> and de∣scend
from their high terms, and
quit their disdainful and proud
thoughts, as if the <HI>Christians</HI> could
not live without their friendship,
and submit to more advantageous
conditions of peace and commerce.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding these privi∣ledges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">yet obnoxi∣ous to af∣fronts and abuses,</NOTE>
and the superaddition of the
Law of Nations to that of common
nature and humanity, as if their
tongues lay not under the restraint
of an Edict, and Religion gave them
a licence to be rude, they do not
abstain oftentimes from reviling <HI>Am∣bassadors</HI>
themselves, as they pass
along the Streets, with their Nati∣on
and their Retinue to their Audi∣dience,
though the <HI>Janisaries</HI> who
are their Guards and in their pay,
are concern'd and think fit to dis∣countenance
and chastise such an in∣solence.</P>
<P>Here is not indulged the liberty
of <HI>Christendom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and to be picked up, and made Slaves of,</NOTE> of running up and
down the Streets and by-Lanes of
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> and being too curi∣ous;
for besides the affronts that
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
are every-where to be met with,
there is danger of being thrust into
some private House, and after some
days or weeks sent over to <HI>Asia,</HI>
or ship'd for <HI>Tartary;</HI> and though
examples of such violent seizures are
but few, yet custom grounded upon
such like fears, makes it necessary
to have the company and attendance
of a Souldier, which is necessary to
desend one from the open assaults of
<HI>Turks,</HI> either spirited with Wine and
Rackee, or with the zeal they have
brought with them from <HI>Mecca,</HI>
(for these religious Pilgrims, who
have visited the Tomb of their <HI>Pro∣phet,</HI>
are very fierce) who will draw
their Knives and Ponyards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">or assault∣ed.</NOTE> and
whatever the design be, whether
only to affright, and to shew what
they would do, if their Emperor had
not forbid it; yet in such a scuffle
the accident may prove very dange∣rous
and fatal too, and only this way
is to be provided against.</P>
<P>Their prejudices lying so deep as
not easily to be removed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patience &amp; prudence necessary;</NOTE> a <HI>Christian</HI>
who is not a Slave as the <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<HI>Armenians</HI> are, who seem to be be∣low
their hate and scorn, will be lia∣ble
to continual affronts, which he
must put up and digest with a pati∣ence
becoming his Religion and his
prudence, and not seem much con∣cerned,
but be deaf rather to the
noise and ill language.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">as also the Habit of the Country, when they travel.</NOTE> if curiosity carries one
twenty or thirty miles into the
Country, the danger is really great
and certain, (for it is usual to seize
upon straglers, if they meet them
in the Fields and Woods separated
from their company, where there is
such great probability of securing
their prey, and of their being undis∣covered),
unless he throws off his
<HI>Christian</HI> Habit, and puts himself
into that of the Country, and goes
armed and well attended. In places
where <HI>Christians</HI> seldom appear, they
are had in greater horror and exe∣cration;
and if they meet with any
civility, it is for the sake of the <HI>Ja∣nizaries</HI>
who accompany them,
whom they are afraid to displease;
though sometimes the ill humour
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
will break forth into such obstinacy
and peevishness, that the <HI>Janiza∣ries</HI>
themselves shall sare the worse
for the <HI>Christians,</HI> whom they wait
upon. I remember, when I was at
<HI>Sardes,</HI> not caring to lodg in the
<HI>Caravanserai</HI> with our Horses, we
employed our <HI>Janizaries</HI> to pro∣cure
us a Lodging for a night or two
in any <HI>Turkish</HI> Cottage, which the
barbarous people would not give
way to, (though they had the assu∣rance
of a gratification above what
so slight a courtesie could possibly
merit) as soon as they understood
we were <HI>Christians;</HI> but rejected the
overture with a great deal of indig∣nation
and scorn, saying, <HI>that they
would upon no condition or reward
suffer their Houses to be defiled by
Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>This opinion they generally bear
of <HI>Christians;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opi∣nion of, and behaviour toward the <HI>Jews.</HI></NOTE> but they entertain a
far worse of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and herein
they think they mightily oblige us,
and would have it taken not only
as an argument of their justice, but
of their good will, that they prefer
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
the <HI>Christians,</HI> whose valor they have
so often experimented to their great
cost, before them whom I found by
just and frequent observation they
esteem as the basest and most con∣temptible
people upon the face of
the Earth, and as a company of
pitiful and low-spirited wretches,
who dare do nothing that is gene∣rous
and brave, and worthy of men.
It is usual with them to say, 'tis mat∣ter
of great wonder to them, that
the <HI>Christians</HI> who pretend to so
much wit and understanding, should
believe the just and great <HI>God</HI> should
give up a <HI>Prophet</HI> so famous for
the holiness of life and miracles
as was their <HI>Messiah</HI> (for this cha∣racter
they acknowledg as most due
to our <HI>B. Saviour</HI>) into the hands
of so vile a Nation as the <HI>Jews,</HI> to
be crucified; and therefore in com∣pliance
with their gross conceptions,
which are no way capable of under∣standing
the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, they
imagine, that <HI>Christ</HI> escaped out of
their hands, and was assumed private∣ly
into Heaven, and another very like
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
him in stature and shape, and the
other signatures of his body, substi∣tuted
in his room, upon whom they
executed their utmost malice and
fury in putting him to so ignomini∣ous
a death. They call them gene∣rally
by the name <HI>Gephut;</HI> which
word is corrupted from the <HI>Arabick,</HI>
and though originally it might de∣note
nothing but the name of that
people, yet now they use it in a
most disgraceful and ignominious
sense, as if there could not possibly
be a greater disgrace or reproach
than the bare title of a <HI>Jew;</HI> tho
sometimes for merriment sake, and
to shew their scorn, they usually pre∣fix
some opprobrious term or other,
to make them more contemptible
and ridiculous. But when they grow
a little more serious, and recollect
themselves somewhat, and change
their scorn into anger, they will up∣braid
them with their obstinacy and
insidelity in rejecting and disbelie∣ving
the holy <HI>Prophets</HI> sent by <HI>God,</HI>
and particularly our <HI>B. Saviour,</HI>
whom they place next their false
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> are
very obnoxious to the insolencies of
the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who oftentimes to
make themselves merry, throw and
kick them to the ground, and pull
them by the Noses and by the Ears.
Against which they dare not so much
as open their lips, for fear the sport
should by the least ill word be turn∣ed
into fury and madness. And very
often, to do them the more disho∣nour,
when any Criminal has recei∣ved
the sentence of death, they pre∣sently
hurry him away, and make
the first <HI>Jew,</HI> rich or poor, they can
light upon, walk with the Rope in
his hand, tyed about the neck of the
other, till they come to the next
Tree out of Town, and then hang
him. It is a great mistake to think,
that the <HI>Turks</HI> admit them into their
<HI>Divans,</HI> or publick Councils, as if
they were privy to any of their de∣signs
they have upon <HI>Christendom,</HI>
or valued their information, or
thought they could reveal the se∣crets
of Government used among
the <HI>Christian Princes.</HI> Their pride
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
will not suffer them to stoop so low;
and the policy of the <HI>Jews</HI> in such
like affairs, is far less than their ma∣lice
and ill-will; and their wit and
cunning is shew'n and exercised bet∣ter
about Merchandise, and Brocage,
and Usury, wherein they do great ser∣vice
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are pitiful
Accomptants; and are employed by
them in collecting their Customs,
and the making even their accounts,
as knowing that their Talent lies
this way, and that they are crafty
and subtil in making bargains, and
understand money matters very well,
there being no <HI>Basha,</HI> or scarce any
of fashion, who has a numerous Fa∣mily,
but retains a <HI>Jew</HI> with him or
about him, whose only business is
to look to the expences of the House,
and buy all things necessary, as
Cloaths, Provisions, and such like.</P>
<P>Above all they retain an immor∣tal
hatred of the <HI>Persians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ha∣tred of the <HI>Persian</HI> greatest.</NOTE> though
they are their Brother <HI>Mahometans,</HI>
and pay a like respect and reverence
to the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and embrace the
dotages, and follies, and impostures
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
of it, with the same concern of zeal.
The original and fundamental diffe∣rence
is about the <HI>Succession,</HI> which
the <HI>Persians</HI> contend to belong to
<HI>Ali,</HI> not only in right of his Wife
<HI>Phatima,</HI> who was Daughter of <HI>Ma∣homet;</HI>
and by the last Will of <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
himself, whose Favourite he
was; but also upon the account of
his Valour, and other personal ex∣cellencies.
Agreeable to this opinion
they have of Him and his Title,
they exclaim upon <HI>Abu Beker, Os∣man,</HI>
and <HI>Omer,</HI> who were successive∣ly
Chiefs of the new <HI>Religion,</HI> as
meer Usurpers, and as Corrupters of
the holy Text; they are one great
argument and subject of the raillery
of the <HI>Persian</HI> Poets, who make odd
and ridiculous representations of
them; whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> look upon
them with all possible veneration,
esteem them not only as the orna∣ments,
but as the props and sup∣ports
of the <HI>Musulman</HI> faith, and
their memories are so sacred among
them, that their names are usually
inscribed upon the inside of their
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
greater <HI>Moschs,</HI> as I have often took
notice of. This difference is height∣ned
by different interpretations of
some ambiguous Texts in their Law,
and by the introduction of different
Rites and Ceremonies in their Reli∣gious
Worship, each fiercely accu∣sing
the other of perverting the mind
of their <HI>Prophet,</HI> and of innovation.
Their disputes and grudges, and
mutual censures and recriminations
have some ages since broke out into
such quarrels and feuds, that seem
no way likely ever to be peiced up
and reconciled. If any discourse hap∣pen
concerning the Religion of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI>
the zeal wherewith the <HI>Turks</HI>
are presently set on fire, does furnish
them with sufficient arguments of
reproach. A <HI>Persian,</HI> they will tell
you, is a desertor of the true faith,
and an Apostate; an Heretick, who
follows his own fancy, and rejects
the establisht and ancient Ceremo∣nies
of Religion; is altogether im∣pure,
as neglectful of those washings,
which their Prophet requires as ne∣cessary
preparations to prayer; one
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
who does not know how to say his
prayers as he ought, void of all sense
of the true Religion; lastly, a very
<HI>Infidel, kizel bash Gaour, the Infidel
with the red head,</HI> alluding to the
<HI>Turbants</HI> or <HI>Shashes</HI> they wind about
their heads, which are usually of
that colour; whereas the colour the
<HI>Turks</HI> most affect is white, except the
kinred and posterity of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
whose special priviledge alone it is
to wear green, a colour they pretend
he most delighted in, and used to go
in when he was old; his name is
writ with that colour in the <HI>Alco∣ran.</HI></P>
<P>However this animosity might be∣gin
upon a Religious account, yet it
is mightily supported by interest,
and managed with a great deal of
dexterity and cunning by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
who cherish these evil opinions and
prejudices in the minds of the peo∣ple
and Souldiers, especially against
both <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Persian,</HI> the two
extremes of their Empire confining
upon their Territories, and so easily
either find or take frequent occasion
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
to quarrel and war with both. By
these arts they work upon the minds
of the Souldiers to a greater willing∣ness
of undergoing the hardships of
war. With this politick Engine they
thrust them upon any design, though
never so unlikely or desperate. For
who is so cowardly and faint-heart∣ed,
or so much in love with life, as
not to venture the loss of it in the
cause of Religion, when the true
Faith either is in danger, or is to be
propagated; when they take up
Arms to chastize and punish Here∣ticks
and Apostates; when they fight
for <HI>God,</HI> and the advancement of his
cause against the profest Enemies of
it? This perswasion inspires them with
desperate and brutish valour, when
they turn their faces upon <HI>Christen∣dom;</HI>
as I shall have occasion to shew
hereafter. And the same argument
they use as successfully, when reason of
State or ambition oblige them to
make a War in <HI>Asia;</HI> a famous in∣stance
of which we have in the ta∣king
of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> in the year of <HI>Christ</HI>
1638, by that warlike Emperor <HI>Mo∣rat,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
who was present there in per∣son,
and not long after died of ex∣cessive
drinking of Wine, to the great
joy of <HI>Poland,</HI> which he threatned
to invade with his well-disciplin'd
Troops, full flesh'd with blood, en∣raged
to revenge the affront and dis∣grace
of his Brother <HI>Osman.</HI> For as
soon as an expedition into <HI>Persia</HI>
was resolv'd upon, and determin'd
in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> the <HI>Church-men</HI> had
orders to sound the alarum in their
Pulpits, for the better animating and
encouraging the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who
otherwise would have had no very
great mind to it. And they perform∣ed
their part mighty well by their
popular and furious preachments,
telling them over and over, that the
<HI>Persians</HI> had made a defection from
the true Faith; that they had per∣verted
the sense of the Divine Law,
by their wicked and false interpre∣tations
and glosses; and how highly
they would deserve of the great <HI>God</HI>
of Heaven and Earth, of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
his Prophet and Apostle, and of the
whole <HI>Musulman</HI> Religion, if they
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
would fight stoutly. Every <HI>Mosch</HI>
rung with zealous exhortations to
fight for the cause of <HI>God,</HI> and the
Souldiers longed to be at it before
the time. And to keep firm their
good resolutions, the <HI>Mufti,</HI> whose
sentence and determination they re∣vere
as most sacred and binding, and
little less than infallible, having or∣ders
from Court so to do, sends forth
his <HI>Brief</HI> all the Empire over, (a
Copy of which in the original lan∣guage
I have laid up in that great
Repository of all curious as well as
useful and necessary Learning, the
most famous <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at
<HI>Oxon</HI>) wherein he thunders up∣on
the heads of the poor <HI>Persians,</HI>
charging them with Apostacy. He
makes them guilty of damnable He∣resies
and Errors, which he endea∣vours
to shew in several branches
and particularities; he solemnly pro∣nounces
them accursed of <HI>God,</HI> and
not worthy to live upon Earth, as∣sures
them that it is a meritorious
work, and what will be rewarded in
Paradise, to root them out, and more
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
meritorious than if they destroyed
the <HI>Christians;</HI> and not contented
with this peremptory sentence, as
bloody and cruel as it is, but as if
it were too mild, he condemns them
to the pit of Hell, and very devout∣ly
prays <HI>God,</HI> that there they may
serve for Asses, and be condemned
to the drudgery of carrying the
<HI>Jews</HI> upon their backs, not being
able to wish them a more vile or
more disgraceful employment. Thus
extreme violent and deadly is their
hatred of Sects; and I would to <HI>God</HI>
the false Religion of <HI>Mahomet</HI> only
afforded instances of it.</P>
<P>This contempt and disesteem of
all others is the natural result of
the over-weening conceit and false
valuation they have of themselves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proud behaviour of the <HI>Turks</HI> arising from a false be∣lief of their being Suc∣cessors of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> in the Em∣pire.</NOTE>
they proudly stile their Port the
Refuge of the World; and fancy the
glory and majesty of the <HI>Roman</HI> and
<HI>Greek</HI> Empire to be devolved upon
them by a most just right; and that
other Princes stand in awe of them,
and are no better than Tributaries,
and do them homage, because they
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
judg it their interest to send their
Ambassadors and Ministers to reside
among them; custom that had its
beginning from the too forward com∣pliance
and condescension of those
who courted the favour of the <HI>Grand
Signor,</HI> this way passing into right,
that no Ambassador can in the least
assure himself of a civil reception,
except he bring his presents along
with him, upon his arrival at the
Imperial City.</P>
<P>The chief ground of this their
arrogance is a mighty confidence
and persuasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and only in the right way of Re∣ligion and Salvation.</NOTE> that they are the
chosen of <HI>God,</HI> to whom he has re∣vealed
his Will and his Law by <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
the <HI>Seal of the Prophets,</HI> as
they stile him; that they are in the
right way which leads to Paradise,
while others wander in by-paths of
error, and consequently are the only
true Believers (for so <HI>Musulman</HI> sig∣nifies)
which is become the general
name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musulman.</NOTE> by which they distinguish
themselves as <HI>Mahometans,</HI> of such
a particular denomination from all
other Religions in the world. They
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
are ashamed of their <HI>Scythian</HI> origi∣nal;
it does not comport with their
present grandeur, to look back and
remember what poor vagabond lives
their Ancestors lead upon Mount
<HI>Imaus,</HI> how they wander'd to and
fro with their Goats and Kids, and
how not being able or willing to sup∣port
their poverty by their labour
and industry, they betook themselves
to the more gainful trade of spoil and
robbery. For the old name of <HI>Turk</HI>
is altogether laid aside and despised
by them, as ominous and of an evil
sound, as if an alteration of condi∣tion
had made them quite another
Nation, and they seem desirous to
forget it, and therefore never menti∣on
it themselves, and take it amiss
and are very angry and look upon it
as an affront, if any <HI>Christian</HI> call
them by it. Such as depend imme∣diately
on the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and are en∣rolled
in his service, and receive his
pay, for distinction and for honour
assume to themselves the title of <HI>Os∣manli,</HI>
out of respect to the name
and memory of <HI>Osman,</HI> to whose
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
valour and prudence they owe the
first beginning of their Empire; and
to shew their duty to the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Family, whose Slaves they glory
themselves to be; but the name of
<HI>Musulman,</HI> which Religion bestows
on them, and equally respects all, is
that they are most pleased with, and
desire chiefly to be known by.</P>
<P>They say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣phets of the old Testa∣ment laid claim to by them.</NOTE> as well as the <HI>Jews,</HI>
we have <HI>Abraham</HI> to our Father;
all the Prophets are theirs, <HI>Moses,
Samuel, David,</HI> and the rest. A <HI>Jew</HI>
thinking to put a trick upon a very
zealous but ignorant <HI>Turk,</HI> who was
discoursing upon this argument, told
him, that they had one <HI>Prophet</HI>
however peculiar to them, which
they could not pretend to or chal∣lenge
in the least, naming the Pro∣phet
<HI>Habakkuk;</HI> to which the other
could not tell what to reply, having
never heard of him, till having re∣course
to his <HI>Imaum,</HI> or Parish-Priest,
and understanding from him, that
<HI>Habakkuk</HI> was a good <HI>Musulman,</HI>
he finds him out, and beats him
soundly for daring to go about to
<PB N="27" REF="21"/>
rob them of one of their greatest
Prophets. In this they triumph and
applaud themselves; this is the con∣tinual
subject of their most solemn
thanksgivings to <HI>God,</HI> that he has
made them <HI>Musulmans,</HI> in such like
form as this, which I have met with,
<HI>Praised be God who has made us to
be of the stock of</HI> Abraham, <HI>and of
the seed of</HI> Ishmael, <HI>and hath given
to us an holy Religion, and a House
to which all Strangers resort, and
has appointed us to be Judges over
men.</HI></P>
<P>In a Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Maho∣metan</HI> Reli∣gion gross,</NOTE> which is made up of
folly and imposture and gross absur∣dities,
which abstracting from the
common and fundamental principles
and notices of Natural Religion, has
nothing in it to recommend it self to
the choice and acceptance of any
sober and wise man, no subtil, no
grave discourses of learning or rea∣son,
not so much as an argument,
that looks like probable, is to be
expected for the defence of it. Their
strength lies more in attacking other
Religions, than establishing their own.
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
What they commonly object against
the <HI>Christian,</HI> argues a stupidity on∣ly
befitting <HI>Turks,</HI> as being the re∣sult
of a gross fancy, that entertains
no other idea's of things than what
are derived from material and sen∣sible
objects. With their foolish and
idle imaginations the great myste∣ries
of our Religion can no way
suit; concerning which they ask
blasphemous and most shameful
questions, and they think this a
sufficient confutation; though it
must be sadly confessed, that for the
sake of some novel Doctrines, and
especially that of <HI>Transubstantia∣tion,</HI>
which interest and a misappli∣ed
zeal and a superstitious fancy
have brought into the <HI>Church,</HI> they
loath and abhor the very name of
<HI>Christianity,</HI> for this reason, because
they think they cannot be <HI>Christi∣ans</HI>
but upon the hard and impossi∣ble
condition of first disbelieving
their very senses.</P>
<P>The liberty their Religion allows
in gratifying the corrupt inclinati∣ons
of nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and bru∣tish.</NOTE> is so far from being
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
a bar and a prejudice to it, that it
sets it the more closely upon their
minds; the doctrine of it being so
agreeable to the example of their
Prophet, who was of a hot lustful
temper, and pleased himself with
variety of women. By this with an
equal cunning he both justified his
own practice and drew in such great
numbers of men, of as bad a tem∣per
and complexion as himself, to
embrace a Religion so charming and
so pleasing to flesh and blood, which
proposed the grossest satisfactions of
sense in Paradise as the reward of
their belief. And least virtue and
modesty should make opposition a∣gainst
this brutish licentiousness and
sensuality, as well as reason and dis∣cretion
dislike and find fault with
the gross follies of it, he takes his
Sword into his hand, and strangely
infatuated with Enthusiasm, to which
a distemper of body inclin'd him,
(for that he first cheated himself,
seems to me as plain as a demonstra∣tion)
and mistaking the dreams of
folly for Divine inspirations, pretends
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
<HI>God</HI> having tried several ways, which
the obstinacy and wickedness of men
had render'd ineffectual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proof of it lying in their Swords,</NOTE> was resol∣ved
at last upon this, and bring men
over to the true Faith by violence
and force of Arms, whom tenderness
and mildness could not move and
work upon. This was his chief war∣rant
(for he pretended but little to
Miracles, and those few he is said to
do are very idle and frivolous) ta∣king
advantage of the distractions
of the time he lived in, and of the
horrid ignorance of his Countrymen
of <HI>Arabia,</HI> which fitted them for
any new impression, when Religion
was broken into so many Sects and
Parties, and a horrid dissoluteness
and corruption of manners had o∣verspread
their <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<P>This is the ground of their con∣fidence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and in their success.</NOTE>
the whole stress of their ar∣guments
lies in their Scymitars;
their Religion, they will tell you,
cannot but be true, which has ex∣tended
it self so far, and has been
blest with so mighty success; that
<HI>God</HI> himself has clearly decided it
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
in their favour, as being his Cham∣pions,
and the propagators of his
truth and worship against the <HI>Infi∣dels;</HI>
witness those triumphs and
victories they have gained over the
<HI>Christians,</HI> the Empires and King∣doms
they have subdued by their
all-conquering and irresistible Arms;
what are all these, say they, but full
and satisfactory proofs and demon∣strations,
that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was sent
by <HI>God,</HI> and that particularly they
(<HI>Turks</HI>) are his true followers, who
have so great a share and part of the
world; as if the <HI>Sophi</HI> and <HI>Mogul</HI>
had little or nothing, and that there
was no such Empire as that of <HI>Chi∣na,</HI>
and <HI>America</HI> they hear the
<HI>Franks</HI> talk of lay out of this world;
and as if all <HI>Christendom,</HI> though
brancht into so many distinct Mo∣narchies
and Governments, was but
a little scantling in comparison of
their Empire, which by degrees has
encreased to that vast bulk, next to
the just judgment of <HI>Almighty God,</HI>
by the follies and divisions of <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>
themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="24"/>
Sometime out of an excess of zeal,
they will ask a <HI>Christian</HI> civilly e∣nough,
as I have been askt my self
in the Portico of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> why
will you not turn <HI>Musulman,</HI> and
be as one of us? The usual answer
is, that my Father before me, and
my Grandfather before him were
<HI>Christians,</HI> and that I think it best
for me to continue in the Religion
of my Country, in which I was born
and bred.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No dispu∣ting with them.</NOTE> And indeed as they are
scarce capable of any other answer,
so neither is it safe or prudential to
give it. It would be a piece of un∣warrantable
zeal and indiscretion
(not to call it by a worse name) to
upbraid them of their follies to their
faces, without the least hope of suc∣cess,
and dispute with them in the
Streets, and in their <HI>Moschs,</HI> when
such like questions are proposed, a∣bout
the purity and truth of the
<HI>Christian</HI> Religion; and supposing
that zeal should transport any one
so far, that he were knockt in the
head in the pursuit of his argument,
he would deserve pity, and his cou∣rage
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
that the fear of death could
no way mate, were to be admired;
but I question whether he could
challenge the glorious title of a
<HI>Martyr,</HI> who without any just occa∣sion,
much less necessity, has brought
his death upon himself. The case of
that poor <HI>Christian</HI> is vastly diffe∣rent,
who having renounced his Faith
and his <HI>Saviour,</HI> being perplexed in
conscience for the great sin he had
been guilty of, and informed by his
Confessor, to whom he had disbur∣thened
his grief which lay so heavy
on him, that he could no way ex∣piate
it, but by publickly professing
himself a <HI>Christian</HI> again, went bold∣ly
to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> and persisting in his
new resolution, received the sentence
of death with great comfort and sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>This shadow of an argument,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Most secure in their opi∣nions and belief.</NOTE> ad∣ded
to the force of education, has
such a mighty influence upon their
minds, that it stifles all the exer∣tions
of reason and natural consci∣ence,
and makes them perverse and
obstinate, and so secure withall, that
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
'tis a sin to doubt of the happiness
of their condition, as to the other
world as well as to this; in justi∣fication
of which confidence it is
most severely forbid by the Govern∣ment
to go about to convert a <HI>Mu∣sulman,</HI>
and the doing of it is ad∣judged
a capital crime, without the
least hope of favour and mercy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> indeed knowing how
generous the <HI>Franks</HI> are in order to
the sfying of their curiosity, as
if Money sprang up in their poc∣kets
ready coined, make their super∣stition
and their hatred vail to their
covetousness, and will admit them
into their very Churches; though
sometimes I have met with a repulse
at <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> where I used to
go often to please my self with the
sight of that glorious Structure;
they telling us, the <HI>Caymacam,</HI> who
had taken frequent notice of the re∣sort
of <HI>Christians,</HI> had sent orders
to keep them out, which they durst
not but comply with, for a time at
least.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Prusia</HI> in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> the
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
Imperial City before they crost the
<HI>Hellespont</HI> and took <HI>Adrianople,</HI> we
procured a Priest to let us into a
<HI>Mosch,</HI> which had been formerly a
<HI>Christian</HI> Church, hard by which
is the Tomb of the Emperor <HI>Vrcha∣nes,</HI>
who took the City. After we
had viewed it, we presented the old
man, who was waiting at the door,
with about half a Dollar, who per∣chance
exspecting but a few Aspers,
was so surprized with it, that to shew
his sense of the unexspected civility,
with great earnestness and devotion,
lifting up his eyes to Heaven, he
prayed <HI>God</HI> in his good time to
make us <HI>Musulmans.</HI></P>
<P>This is the only way of taming
their fierceness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Only to be pleased with mo∣ney and presents.</NOTE> by presenting them
money, and bribing them with gifts
to be civil; and so long as this plea∣sant
force is upon them, they will
pretend great kindness; but if they
do not depend upon you, or if you
withdraw your hand, they return
to their natural rudeness and hatred
with greater violence, which hope
of gain and some present advantage
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
had restrained; for to be kind to
<HI>Christians</HI> is against the very prin∣ciples
of their Religion. Here and
there may be a few, whom a sense
of gratitude for received kindnesses,
and a freer conversation with <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI>
by reason of commerce, have
soft'ned out into better manners.</P>
<P>As I and my Companion were walk∣ing
in the Streets of <HI>Bursia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An instance of a gene∣rous civili∣ty.</NOTE> as they
now call it, to see what remains of
Antiquity we could meet with, a
<HI>Gentleman-Turk</HI> (for so he shewed
himself) guessing by our complexi∣ons,
that there was something of
<HI>Christian</HI> under our <HI>Turkish</HI> Clothes,
asked our <HI>Janizaries,</HI> if we were
not <HI>Franks.</HI> They readily confessed
it, and upon further demand of
what Country of <HI>Phrenkistan</HI> or
<HI>Christendom,</HI> knowing that we were
<HI>English,</HI> he invites us to his House;
which civility as we were unwilling
to accept, so did we not know how
to refuse; but after a little consul∣tation
with our two <HI>Janizaries,</HI>
who were very forward for it, we
went with him. Upon our first coming
<PB N="37" REF="26"/>
in, he bids us heartily welcome, and
exprest such respect and kindness,
as fear of being taken notice of
did not permit him to shew in the
publick Streets. He entertained us
with Coffee and Sherbet and Sweet-meats,
according to the custom of
the Country; our wonder at this un∣usual
and extraordinary treatment
was the more heightned, when we
understood that he had been a <HI>Haggi,</HI>
or <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> and had visited <HI>Maho∣mets</HI>
Birth-place at <HI>Medinat Alnabi,</HI>
the <HI>City of the Prophet,</HI> and Sepul∣cher
at <HI>Mecca</HI> (from which places
they use to bring back greater mea∣sures
of zeal and fury against the
<HI>Christians</HI>). But to satisfie us, he
told us, that he had formerly re∣ceived
very great kindnesses from
an <HI>English</HI> Merchant at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and
that he was resohttp://www.thecatseyes.com / show.asp?show<SEG REND="decorInit">i</SEG>d=2460ved for his sake to
be civil to his Countrymen where∣ever
he met them. Not content with
this, he would scarce give us leave
to depart, proffered us the use of his
House, while we stayed in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI>
and upon our refusal, took a solemn
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
farewell of us, and sent one of his
Slaves to attend upon us to the <HI>Se∣raglio,</HI>
which we had a great mind
to look into. One may travel from
the <HI>Danube</HI> to <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and per∣chance
not meet with the like in∣stance
of generous civility.</P>
<P>They observe most strictly the
Rite of Circumcision,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcisi∣on.</NOTE> as the Seal of
the Covenant, which <HI>God</HI> made with
<HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Ismael,</HI> which gives
them a right and title to all the pri∣viledges
of the <HI>Musulman</HI> Faith. This
Sacrament the Impostor <HI>Mahomet</HI>
thought fit to receive, as well in
compliance with the <HI>Jews,</HI> as with
the custom of his Country and ma∣ny
other Nations in the <HI>East,</HI> who
were punctual in the observation of
it, out of a strict adherence to the
traditions of their Fathers, and the
usage of ancient times, without any
remembrance of the true ground of
its orignal institution. They do not
circumcise Children in their infancy,
much less think themselves obliged
to the eighth day; no Canon tyes
them to a set time, but they are left
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
wholly to their liberty, and to con∣sult
their convenience, so it be not
defer'd beyond the thirteenth year,
which is the utmost limit, (that is,
if they be not deprived of an op∣portunity
of doing it for want of a
skilful hand) in memory of the Cir∣cumcision
of <HI>Ismael,</HI> which as they
alledg agreeably to the holy Scrip∣tures,
was done when he was at that
age. Till which time the Boys wear
their Hair long, but made up into
curled knots hanging over their
Shoulders. The Ceremony is per∣form'd
with great noise and tumult,
which with them are the only ex∣pressions
of their festival joy and
mirth; all their solemnities being
disorderly and rude, and without
any decorum or discretion to ma∣nage
them. The whole day is spent
in entertaining their Relations and
Neighbours, who are to be witnesses
of the operation; for at this time
they think they may fairly and law∣fully
lay aside their gravity, and
wholly give themselves up to mer∣riment.
But as soon as Evening-prayers
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
are over, they prepare sor
the business, which is committed to
the care of a Chirurgeon, or Barber,
or any other who has an easie and
dextrous hand. In the mean while
the Boy is brought in by his Father
and Kinred, in his new Vest and
Turbant, whom they flatter and ca∣ress
to divert him from melancholy
and fear, and to prevent him from
fainting before he feels the sharpness
of the Rasor; telling him, that in
a few minutes he will be enrolled
among the followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
and be made capable of the favour
of <HI>God</HI> and the joys of <HI>Paradise.</HI>
Sometimes they cast the Boy into
a sleep with an <HI>Opiat</HI> potion, when
they think he has not courage e∣nough
to endure it; or do it by a
surprize, before he is aware, having
first prepared all things in order to
it, and then making as if it were to
be deferred till the next day, quick∣ly
return and finish the intended
work. Yet notwithstanding the great
stir they have made in the day-time,
and that by this they are initiated
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
into their Religion, they do not use
to have any solemn prayers at it;
only the Operator in the very act
cries out, <HI>Bismillah, in the name of
God,</HI> three times, the Musick play∣ing
to drown the noise and howling
of the young <HI>Turk,</HI> bleeding under
his wound. At the Circumcision of
the Son of the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI> or any
other considerable <HI>Bassa</HI> or Officer,
for the greater pomp and solemnity,
and for example sake to encourage
him to endure what they have un∣dergone
before him, several others
are circumcised at the same time;
between whom upon the account of
this Religious solemnity, there is
contracted such a dearness and
friendship, beyond all tyes of natu∣ral
relation, that it is only dissolved
by death, and ever after they call
themselves by the title of <HI>Sunnet∣dash,</HI>
or <HI>Associate of Circumcision,</HI>
which they value above that of Bro∣ther.
In the night they repeat often
the same rude mirth, as they had
in the day. Those Villains who out
of desperation or a desire of living
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>
in all bestial sensuality, turn Rene∣gados,
are compelled to be cut.
They first appear before the <HI>Cady</HI>
or Justice, and acquaint him with
the design of becoming a <HI>Musulman,</HI>
and desire to be admitted to the fa∣vour
and priviledg. Immediately he
commands their heads to be shaven,
and the matter being usually known
before, Clothes and Turbants are
provided and freely bestowed upon
their Proselytes; and sometime upon
his first coming out in his <HI>Musul∣mans</HI>
Habit, they set him upon a
Horse, and carry him in triumph
through the Streets of the <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI>
with a Lance or Dart in his
hand, to signifie they are ready to
fight for and defend the Religion
they have newly taken up, with the
utmost hazard of their lives. Some
few, perchance out of a natural hor∣ror
of pain (I intend it only of the
Apostate <HI>Christians,</HI> for the natu∣ral-born
<HI>Turks</HI> never omit it) have
by several artifices and wiles eluded
the sentence of the Law, and remain
uncircumcised, and abhor this invi∣sible
<PB N="43" REF="29"/>
sign of a <HI>Mahometan;</HI> and old
men especially, to whom this wound
might prove deadly and fatal; but
then they must keep it mighty pri∣vate
and secret, lest it come to the
<HI>Cady</HI>'s ear, whom they must other∣wise
bribe, or else be forced to sub∣mit
to this piece of religious seve∣rity.</P>
<P>It was one of the great policies
of <HI>Mahomet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pray∣ers at set times.</NOTE> that he might the bet∣ter
establish the fancies that were to
be the peculiar characters of his
Religion, to press upon his follow∣ers
the frequent practice of those
great duties of Nature, which refer
to the worship and service of God,
as if in this they were to out-do both
<HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> For they are
obliged to make their solemn pray∣ers
five times a day, at set hours;
which vary according to the diffe∣rent
seasons of the year. They do
not divide the natural day into so
many equal portions, as not under∣standing
the use of Aequinoctial
hours, or the benefit of Sun Dials,
to measure and adjust their time;
<PB N="44" REF="30"/>
but only have regard to the rising
and setting of the Sun, and its lon∣ger
or shorter stay above the Hori∣zon;
though of later years they
are mightily taken with the inven∣tion
of Watches, there being scarce
a <HI>Turk</HI> in <HI>Constantinople</HI> of any fashi∣on,
but is master of one, and be∣sides
has a striking Clock in his
House; a considerable number of
Artizans of the <HI>French</HI> Nation reap∣ing
good advantage from this their
curiosity. The times are at Sun∣rising,
Noon, the Middle-time be∣tween
Noon and Sun set, Sun-set,
and an hour and half in the Night;
only upon <HI>Friday,</HI> which they call
<HI>Giumahgun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday their day of Religious Conventi∣on.</NOTE> or the day of their Re∣ligious
Convention, they add to their
devotion, and go to Church about
the middle of the Forenoon; at
which time the more devout shut
up their Shops, but afterwards re∣turn
to their trade and business.
This being the only distinction and
solemnity of the day, and no other
reverence paid it. Otherwise there
is the same noise in the Streets and
<PB N="45" REF="30"/>
Markets, the same chaffering of wares,
their Magazines as much frequented,
and no difference as to the neatness
and fineness of their Habit; they
thinking they have done enough,
if they step to the <HI>Mosch</HI> at that pe∣culiar
time for a quarter of an hour.
In the time of <HI>Ramazan,</HI> which is
the most solemn time of the whole
year, wherein they pretend to most
devotion, and wherein the most care∣less
will endeavour to expiate the
miscarriages of the year past, some
will rise two hours before day to
praise the name of God in a set form,
this being a holy month, devoted to
fasting and the more strict exercises
of Religion. In the greatest <HI>Moschs</HI>
on Friday in the Afternoon, such of
the Priests as have acquired the fame
of Learning and Eloquence, enlarge∣ing
upon some words of the <HI>Alco∣ran,</HI>
entertain the people with ha∣rangues
in their way, with a great
deal of noise and seeming zeal, tend∣ing
to the advance of Piety, Justice,
Charity, and the other vertues of
conversation and society. But this
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>
is extraordinary, which they are not
bound to, their part being to read
several Surats or Chapters of the
<HI>Alcoran,</HI> and recite the prescribed
office of Prayer: A little stock of
Learning serving to qualifie them
for this function.</P>
<P>Before they make their prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their washings.</NOTE>
whether publickly in their <HI>Moschs,</HI>
or privately in their Houses, they
are very solicitous to wash them∣selves,
as thinking, that without this
previous lustration <HI>God</HI> will be deaf
to their requests, and that all their
devotion will be ineffectual and to
no purpose. This being so necessa∣ry
a qualification of prayer, that
they might not be destitute of con∣veniencies,
and so be forced to omit
their devotion for want of due pre∣paration
this way, besides the vast
number of them every-where in their
Streets, there are Conduits and Foun∣tains
with great variety of Cocks
adjoining to the greater <HI>Moschs</HI> for
this purpose. It is not enough to
wash themselves, except they do it
after a particular manner, which
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>
though difficult in it self, yet custom
and use have rendred so easie and
familiar to them, that they do it
without delay and without error;
the manner is this, as I made a <HI>Turk,</HI>
whom I had oblig'd, shew me parti∣cularly
in my Chamber. Tucking
up their Vests and short Sleeves a∣bove
their Elbows, they take up as
much water as they can hold in the
hollow of their hands, which they
wash thrice, and then putting their
forefinger inro the left side of their
mouth, and their Thumb into the
right, wash that three times also.
Snuffling up water with their No∣strils,
they gently stroke their Face
from the Forehead to the Chin, and
back again; next their Arms to the
bending; taking off their Turbant
they rub with the inside of their
Hand the forepart of their Head,
from the Crown to the Forehead, put∣ting
their fore and middle Finger into
the cavities of their Ears, and their
Thumbs behind, washing their Necks
with three Fingers of both Hands
reversed. Their publick <HI>Bagnos</HI> or
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>
Baths usually are built very hand∣som
and stately; all great men have
them in their Houses for their own
use, and the uses of their Women,
being frequented not only for health
and cleanliness, but for Religion in
several particular cases, in which
they are obliged to cleanse other
parts of the Body, not to be named,
which yet I have seen them do at an
open Fountain in the Streets. This
ceremony, be their occasions never
so great and urgent, they cannot
omit without great scandal and guilt.
Before which purgation they look
upon themselves as unfit not only
to go to Church, but to converse or
to be conversed with. But how shall
such as travel in the Desarts of <HI>A∣rabia</HI>
or <HI>Libya</HI> comply with this
fundamental Article of <HI>Mahometism,</HI>
where they cannot be profuse with
the provisions of water they carry
with them for the necessities of life,
where they meet with no Springs to
supply themselves? Are they wholly
freed from the obligation of pray∣er?
No. The subtle Impostor has
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>
herein provided a remedy against
this contingence; in case of the
faileur of water, Sand or Ashes or a
Morter-clod crumbled into dust shall
do as well, and shall convey the
same cleansing virtue, as much as
if they had made use of the clearest
Fountain-water. They use cold wa∣ter,
except in case of sickness and
weakness, when they are indulged
to warm it, for fear otherwise the
cold should strike into their bodies
and encrease their malady. But see
the madness and folly of their super∣stition!
by the sprinkling of a few
drops of cold water, they think their
minds are as much purified as their
bodies, and that this is a sufficient
purgation from the defilements of
sin, and a most effectual remedy a∣gainst
brutality, and the most hor∣rid
impieties they can possibly be
guilty of.</P>
<P>To put them in mind the better
of these duties of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Called to Prayers by the Priests or their Servants▪</NOTE> that nei∣ther
pleasure nor business may di∣vert
their thoughts, the Priests or
their Servants give notice to the
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
people publickly of the approach∣ing
times of prayer. And for their
better accommodation, about the
<HI>Menar</HI> or Pyramid raised from the
ground adjoining to the <HI>Mosch,</HI> is
built a Gallery, to which there is an
ascent by a winding pair of Stairs,
the door whereof always looks to∣wards
<HI>Mecca.</HI> Here walking round
and straining their voices in a kind
of singing tone, which they lengthen
out, they invite them in a peculiar
form of words, which is common to
all, and from which they do not
depart a tittle, to come and make
their prayers; and by this way they
supply the want of Bells, which they
neither use themselves, nor permit
the poor <HI>Greeks.</HI> It is scarce cre∣dible
how this noise, by reason of
this advantage of heigth, in a clear
evening may be distinctly heard. The
words are exactly these; <HI>God is
great, God is great; there is no
God but God, there is no God but
God; I confess that</HI> Mahomet <HI>is
the Messenger of God, I confess that</HI>
Mahomet <HI>is the Messenger of God;
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>
come to prayers, come to prayers;
come to worship, come to worship;
God is great, God is great; there
is no God but God.</HI> In the morning
sometimes they remind them, that
<HI>prayer is better than sleep,</HI> and bid
them repeat the <HI>Phatiha</HI> or first
Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which they
use as frequently as we do the <HI>Lords
Prayer.</HI> In the <HI>Royal Moschs,</HI> where
there are usually four Pyramids,
(only that of <HI>Achmet,</HI> the Grand-Father
of the present Emperor, in
the <HI>Atmidan</HI> or <HI>Hippodrome</HI> in <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>
having six) this procla∣mation
is made with greater solem∣nity
by several Priests jointly at the
same time, but without the least va∣riation
of words, and agreeable to
the same number of repetitions.</P>
<P>Their prayers are in the <HI>Arabick</HI>
language,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pray∣ers in <HI>Ara∣bick,</HI> and of what na∣ture.</NOTE> the language of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
and his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which by reason
of their daily use are easily under∣stood
by the people; to which also
the frequent mixture of <HI>Arabick</HI>
words in the <HI>Turkish</HI> does not a lit∣tle
conduce. The matter of them is
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>
generally pious, and what might
not misbecome those who worship
the true <HI>God;</HI> but that they are de∣fective;
except where they reflect
most impiously upon the most sacred
and venerable mysteries of the Reli∣gion
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> by making a depre∣catory
appeal to <HI>God,</HI> with a <HI>far be
it from thee, O Lord, what the
Christians impute to thee;</HI> meaning,
that <HI>thou hast a Son.</HI> These prayers,
as several other parts of their wor∣ship,
have for their foundation not
only the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in which, as they
speak, are contained the commands
of <HI>God,</HI> but the practice and exam∣ple
of <HI>Mahomet</HI> derived down to
them by tradition, which they call
<HI>Sunna.</HI> By which pretence they have
introduced several customs, though
in matters of less moment, of which
there is not the least intimation in
the Book of their Law; and the
people, out of a blind reverence and
ignorant zeal, esteem them to have
the same authority and to be equal∣ly
binding. They direct their pray∣ers
only to <HI>God</HI> Almighty, acknow∣ledging
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
his infinite power, soveraign∣ty,
and right over Angels and Men
and Devils, and the whole compre∣hension
of all other Beings. They
put up no prayers to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> nor
do they bow their knees, as ever I
could observe, as some write, at the
mention of his name, it being one
of their principles, that <HI>God</HI> is only
to be adored and worshipped, which
makes them so severe upon us, ar∣raigning
us of Idolatry for worship∣ping
<HI>Christ,</HI> who is <HI>God blessed
for ever; Arianism,</HI> which <HI>Maho∣met</HI>
learned of the Monk <HI>Sergius,</HI>
being one main ingredient of their
Religion. In what a fair way are a
great number of false <HI>Christians</HI>
(especially inferior persons, who are
taught to renounce the <HI>Lord God
their Saviour, who bought them</HI>)
in <HI>Poland</HI> and elsewhere, to become
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> if the <HI>Grand Signor</HI>
should enlarge his conquests among
them, which <HI>God</HI> avert for the good
of <HI>Christendom!</HI> Only as to what
concerns <HI>Mahomet,</HI> they wish <HI>God</HI>
would be propitious to him and his
<PB N="54" REF="35"/>
Family, <HI>that peace and mercy and
the benediction of God may be upon
him;</HI> which civility of expression
<HI>Mahomet</HI> himself uses in the <HI>Alco∣ran</HI>
toward the holy Patriarchs and
Prophets and our <HI>B. Saviour,</HI> in imi∣tation
of whom their writers take
up the same form, joining the name
of the blessed <HI>Virgin</HI> to his, as <HI>Isa
the Son of Miriam, on whom be
peace.</HI> They do <HI>Mahomet</HI> no other
honour in their offices of Prayer,
besides frequent acknowledgments
of his mission from <HI>God</HI> as his Apo∣stle
and Messenger.</P>
<P>There is a great semblance of de∣votion
in their Churches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pub∣lick Service in their <HI>Moschs.</HI></NOTE> This is
the only representation that can be
made of them to their advantage.
Take them in their Streets and
Houses, they are rude and fierce and
ill-natur'd; but their modesty here
triumphs over their fierceness of
temper, and a sence of Religion influ∣ences
their behaviour, and makes it
extraordinary humble and reverent.
I happen'd to be present at Evening-prayer
in the time of <HI>Ramazan</HI> in
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>
the new <HI>Mosch</HI> built by the Mother
of this Emperor, where might be an
Assembly of no less than two or three
thousand. Lifting up the Antiport,
and advancing a little forward, I
could not perceive the least noise;
no coughing or spitting, no disor∣derly
running up and down, no ga∣zing
one upon another, no enter∣tainments
of discourse, nothing of
irreverence or heedlesness, as if they
had forgot the business they came
about; but all were mighty intent
and serious, and listening with great
diligence to the Priest, or busie at
their private prayers, with that pro∣found
silence, as if it had been not
only a sin, but a crime that drew
after it bodily punishment to be in∣flicted
immediately, to misbehave
themselves whether in discourse or
gesture in that place.</P>
<P>When they make their prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the manner of it.</NOTE>
they turn their faces toward that de∣termined
point of the Heavens, un∣der
which <HI>Mecca</HI> is placed, as the
<HI>Christians</HI> do to the <HI>East,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Jews</HI>
to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in what Climate or po∣sition
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>
of Sphere soever they are;
standing almost erect, only that
their heads do encline somewhat
forward; their eyes being fixt up∣on
the ground, and their hands
close to the breast, almost in the fi∣gure
of a Cross, without any the
least motion, as if they were in an
extasie. But soon after, upon the re∣peating
of some words, they at set
intervals incline their heads, and
bend their bodies, and prostrate
themselves upon the pavement, co∣ver'd
with Carpets or Maps of
<HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> several times together;
then sitting cross-leg'd, their hands
placed upon their knees, but not ex∣actly
in the same easie posture as in
their houses, but as it were some∣what
higher, and upon their right
heel. They often pass from one ge∣sture
to another, and make often in∣terchanges,
which tradition and cu∣stom
have made necessary in order
to the right performance of this du∣ty.
Besides, they have a trick to
move their heads several times from
one shoulder to another, as if they
<PB N="57" REF="36"/>
shewed the expectation they have of
the coming of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who pro∣mised
to appear at the last day at the
time of prayer; or else (which is the
reason <HI>Albert Bobowski,</HI> a learned
<HI>Polonian,</HI> who had been kept in the
<HI>Seraglio</HI> full nineteen years, and a
person well-skill'd in all the Rites of
the <HI>Mahometan</HI> worship, gave me
upon enquiry) to shew respect to
their Angel-keepers, whom they
foolishly believe at that time to sit
upon their shoulders. They make
use of Chaplets of Beads, upon
which they number their short
prayers, such as <HI>Sabhan Allah, bles∣sed
be God; Allah Ekber, God is
great; Alhemdo lillah, praise be gi∣ven
to God; Bismilla, in the name
of God;</HI> which they will repeat
sometimes a hundred times, as they
will likewise the several names of
<HI>God,</HI> with great noise and fervency.
We heard in <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> six or
seven Priests crying out several times
till they were even hoarse again, <HI>We
believe, we believe;</HI> as if they
thought <HI>God Almighty</HI> had been to
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
be wrought upon by such loud and
vain repetitions.</P>
<P>In making bows and prostrati∣ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pro∣strations.</NOTE>
which they look upon as ne∣cessary
appendages of prayer, their
devotion does chiesly consist; to
omit them is very scandalous, there
being not a greater disgrace and re∣proach
among themselves than to be
accounted <HI>Binamaz, one who does
not say his prayers.</HI> It is enough
however they do it in their Houses,
so they do not neglect the <HI>Mosch</HI> too
much, and especially in their Month
of Fast; but the <HI>Janizaries</HI> parti∣cularly,
who by the obligation of
their Order fight for the propaga∣tion
and advancement of the joint-interest
of Religion and the Empire,
think this their zeal and readiness
enough to excuse them from going
thither too often, and dispense with
themselves for not going above once
or twice in a year, except such as
live in the two <HI>Oda's,</HI> or publick
Chambers in <HI>Constantinople</HI> design'd
for their Lodgings, adjoining to
which is a <HI>Mosch</HI> peculiar to them.
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
But some on the other side, who
would be taken for Saints, are as
extravagant in the excess, as the <HI>Ja∣nizaries</HI>
are usually neglectful:
For at the times of Prayer they will
dismount from their Horses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exces∣sive zeal of some <HI>Turks,</HI></NOTE> leave
their shooting and hunting, spread
their Handkerchiefs in the open
streets, as well as in the Fields and
Woods or Sea-shore; as I have known
them do, when crossing the <HI>Propon∣tis</HI>
we were forced by violence of
weather, to make into a Cove be∣tween
two Rocks, where I found se∣veral
Boats of <HI>Turks</HI> got thither be∣fore
me, being the only <HI>Frank</HI> in the
company. After their prayers, they
fell to drinking of <HI>Coffee,</HI> and ob∣serving
that I was wet and cold and
indisposed, by reason of the ill-wea∣ther,
they bid one of their Slaves
give that <HI>Infidel</HI> who was in the Cleft
of the Rock, where I had shelter'd
my self against the wind, a Dish of
<HI>Coffee,</HI> which was very welcome,
not daring to offend them by ma∣king
use of the Wine I had laid
in the Boat to serve me during
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>
my Voyage to <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>In some this devotion certainly
flows from a principle of conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and hypo∣crisie of others.</NOTE>
and is very hearty and sincere, as
both justice and charity oblige us
to believe; but it would be as great
folly and weakness not to censure
others of gross and ridiculous folly
and dissimulation, as this follow∣ing
instance will fully demonstrate:
My Lord Ambassador one day enter∣tain'd
at Dinner one <HI>Husain Aga,</HI>
who had formerly been Customer
at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and at that time one of
the great men of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by
reason of the relation that his Father-in-Law
had to the <HI>Vizir</HI> then in
<HI>Candia,</HI> but as very a <HI>Turk</HI> as is in
the whole Empire, together with five
other Hogs fatning up for the slaugh∣ter.
They drank mighty freely of
Wine and Strong-water, which had
been distilled in <HI>Christendom,</HI> for the
sake of which they chiefly came;
though they would jestingly at Ta∣ble
check themselves for daring to
transgress the Law of their <HI>Pro∣phet:</HI>
But being once in, they drank
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
on, a drop of each defiling them as
much as the greatest load they could
stand under. But however, to shew
that for all this extravagance they
were <HI>Musulmans,</HI> as soon as they
heard the Priest from the Spire of
a neighbouring <HI>Mosch</HI> at <HI>Ikindi,</HI> that
is, the middle-time between mid-day
and Sun-set, call to prayers, they
desired a Carpet might be spread in
the Court-yard upon the ground,
where they went very devoutly to
their prayers, and left us to wonder
at their stupid and irreligious hypo∣crisie.
This is no very rare or un∣usual
thing among them, it being
what I have seen also practised be∣fore
a great number of <HI>Christians</HI>
in other places.</P>
<P>The Fast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fast of <HI>Rama∣zan.</HI></NOTE> which every year is ob∣served
in the month of <HI>Ramazan,</HI> is
another great fundamental of the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion. Which though
it be fix'd as to the month, yet be∣cause
the years they make use of in
their Religious and Civil accompts
are Lunary, without any intercala∣tion
to adjust the different periods of
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>
the motions of the Sun and Moon,
there is an anticipation made every
year of eleven days, and by conse∣quent
it does not return to the same
beginning, till after a Circle of thir∣ty
three years has expired. In de∣termining
the beginnings of months,
not troubling themselves with the
nice calculations of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> they
only respect the Phasis of the Moon,
not in the least its Conjunction;
and accordingly, as it must needs
often happen, they begin the month
one day sooner or later, as the Moon
appears. Sometimes they have cau∣sed
their Lamps at their <HI>Moschs</HI> in
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> which is the usual
signal in this month, to be lighted
at midnight, as soon as it has been
attested by credible Witnesses, who
either have had better eyes or a
clearer Horizon, that they have seen
the Moon that night. But however
to prevent confusion, in rainy and
cloudy weather, after a days ex∣pectation
and forbearance, they be∣gin
it the next, when the thickness
and haziness of the Sky hinder it
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>
from appearing. Generally upon
the sight of the New-Moon they
bow their bodies, gently stroking
their faces and beards, and put up
prayers to <HI>God.</HI> During this month,
as long as the Sun continues above
the Horizon, a total abstinence from
all manner of sustenance is injoined;
in the very heat of Summer, when
the length of the days adds to the
trouble and irksomeness of it, they
dare not so much as put one drop
of water into their mouths; and
indeed herein their strength and
their patience are both equally to
be admired; such restraints a fear
of violating this severe Law of their
<HI>Prophet</HI> lays upon their very natures,
that a natural <HI>Turk,</HI> though at other
times brutish enough, and apt to
indulge his appetite, will choose ra∣ther
to perish with thirst, and faint
away by reason of an empty sto∣mach,
than commit such a great
sin, though in private and out of
the sight of the world. Their con∣stancy
or rather obstinacy have been
so great, that their Histories relate,
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
that the <HI>Janizaries</HI> themselves, who
in several other matters do not use
to be over scrupulous, when they
have been in the Field and prepa∣ring
to engage their enemies, have
abhorred the very thought of eat∣ing
and drinking in <HI>Ramazan</HI> time,
till they have been dispensed with by
the <HI>Mufti,</HI> assuring them by his in∣fallible
authority, that it is more ac∣ceptable
to <HI>God,</HI> to defend his Re∣ligion
against the enemies of it,
than to observe its precepts to the
prejudice of it, in weakning them∣selves
by such excessive and immo∣derate
fasting; and the Emperors
own example has prevailed with
them above the necessities of na∣ture.
The <HI>Renegadoes</HI> perchance,
who have embraced <HI>Mahometism,</HI>
that they may wallow the more se∣curely
in all manner of sensuality
and lust (for no one can be suppo∣sed
so sottish, or void of reason and
common sence, as to embrace it up∣on
conviction, as if he had found by
strength of argument, that it was
true, and upon that account ought
<PB N="65" REF="40"/>
to be embraced) do not use this se∣verity
upon themselves; but then
their great care is, that they be not
discovered. For though it be not a
capital crime, yet the irreligious cri∣minal,
if convicted before the <HI>Cady,</HI>
is oftentimes drub'd, and by way
of expiation and penance, is to fast
a considerable number of days. To
prevent the scandal and the punish∣ment
of it, they durst not so much
as enter into a <HI>Cabaret</HI> (when the
<HI>Greeks</HI> were allowed to sell Wine)
which would have been a double
crime, remembring the sad fate of
him, who being got drunk in the
<HI>Ramazan</HI> time, had hot melted
Lead poured down his Throat and
into his Ears by <HI>Nassuf,</HI> who was
chief <HI>Vizir</HI> under <HI>Achmet,</HI> who
judged his bad example merited
this severity: though some, out of
their excessive love to it, will ven∣ture
to drink in <HI>Christians</HI> Houses,
where they may be free and can
have it. Their luxury, instead of
being repressed by this total absti∣nence,
is the rather heightned and
<PB N="66" REF="41"/>
inflamed; for as soon as the Sun is
set, and their Lamps flame round
about the Towers of their <HI>Moschs,</HI>
which they place in several figures,
as of a Gally, and the like, which
make a very diverting shew; and
that prayers are ended, from which
none who are well are to be absent,
who have any care of their reputa∣tion,
they play the gluttons more
solemnly, and spend the whole night
in entertainments and revellings.
They pass over the day with a great
deal of weariness and drowsiness,
wishing and yawning till the Even∣ing-Star
appears; but in the night
they enjoy themselves doubly for
their forced abstinence and for∣bearance;
which is therefore the
more shameful and ridiculous, be∣cause
it is but an introduction to
riot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The case of sick per∣sons, Tra∣vellers, and Children.</NOTE> Sick persons and Travellers are
dispensed with, but upon this con∣dition,
that when they have regain∣ed
their health, or have finished
their voyages, they fast so many
days in another month, till they
have filled up the number. Some
<PB N="67" REF="41"/>
out of a foolish opinion of merit,
begin their Fast in the month prece∣ding,
but which is always to be con∣cluded
with the last day of <HI>Rama∣zan,</HI>
and never to be extended be∣yond
this limit. No Children are
tyed to this hard Law, though some∣times
they make Boys of five or six
years of age, that they may learn
to accustom themselves, fast two or
three days together, after some lit∣tle
intermissions. This month was
consecrated by <HI>Mahomet</HI> to this so∣lemnity,
because in it he pretended
to receive the <HI>Alcoran</HI> from Heaven.
In this they all pretend to a greater
devotion than ordinary; and he
who at other times scarce cared to
go to Church, thinks now to redeem
his former neglects by his greater
diligence and frequency. The last
day of it is devoted to the memory
of their dead Friends and Relations,
whose Graves marked with red Oker
they usually visit, and put up their
prayers and suffrages for their Souls,
that it may be well with them;
with which ceremony they end the
<PB N="68" REF="42"/>
day and the Fast together.</P>
<P>The following Moon begins the
Feast of the great <HI>Bairam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feast of great <HI>Bairam.</HI></NOTE> which
is a time of great mirth and joy,
lasting only for three days. In the
morning of the first of which the
great Guns are discharged, and
Drums beat. There is nothing but
joy and triumph in the Streets.
They seem to be quite another sort
of men than they are all the year
besides, diverting themselves in the
open Streets with Musick and Dan∣cing,
making invitations and enter∣tainments
at their Houses, and send∣ing
presents to their Friends. A great
number of Sheep are killed too up∣on
the first day of this Festival;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacrifice Sheep.</NOTE>
which they call <HI>Kurban,</HI> or <HI>the Of∣fering,</HI>
hereby thinking that <HI>God</HI>
will become propitious and favou∣rable
to them, this being no obscure
Relique of the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Worship,
(<HI>Mahomet</HI> borrowing something out
of the Religions then most in vogue,
when he first started up a <HI>Prophet</HI>)
and is questionless looked upon by
them in the nature of an expiatory
<PB N="69" REF="42"/>
Sacrifice, which they use at other
times upon solemn occasions. As
<HI>Solyman,</HI> when he enter'd <HI>Buda</HI>
1541, sacrificed in the great Church
dedicated to the <HI>V. Mary,</HI> turned
into a <HI>Mosch;</HI> and so at <HI>Strigoni∣um</HI>
two years after, in 1543; As
<HI>Selim</HI> his Father did at <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI>
for good success in his expe∣dition
into <HI>Egypt.</HI> Every man is
his own Priest, and may slay his
Sheep at his own House. They
distribute the several parts of it a∣mong
the poor, reserving nothing
in the least to their own uses, which
will take off from the merit of the
Sacrifice; which also ceases and is
rendred ineffectual, if these Victims
be purchased with money, got dis∣honestly
either by fraud or violence.
I have been assured of a <HI>Turk,</HI> who
was so scrupulous this way, that in∣stead
of satisfying for the injustice
he had been guilty of, and restoring
what he was wrongfully possessed
of, only desired an <HI>English</HI> Merchant
to change such a number of Dollars
for others of the same species, fancy∣ing
<PB N="70" REF="43"/>
those that were got honestly
in the way of industry and Mer∣chandise
would thrive better with
him than those he parted with, as if
the money only were in fault, and
drew a curse after it, which he fan∣cied
thus easily avoided by an ex∣change.
The Sheep thus sacrificed,
they fancy enter into Paradise,
and there graze all along the
flow'ry Meadows upon the Banks of
Rivers flowing with Milk and Ho∣ney.</P>
<P>Seventy days after is the Feast
of little <HI>Bairam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feast of little <HI>Bairam.</HI></NOTE> which is not ob∣served
with half the pomp and noise
as the former.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pil∣grimage to <HI>Mecca.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In the intervening space the Pil∣grims
prepare from the farthest quar∣ters
of the Empire for their journey to
wards <HI>Mecca,</HI> that they may enter that
City in procession the first day of this
Feast. In this pilgrimage all perswasi∣ns
of <HI>Mahometans</HI> agree, the obliga∣tion
lying upon all indifferently to
perform it, once at least in their lives.
The concourse of Pilgrims is extra∣ordinary
great; and for the greater
<PB N="71" REF="43"/>
pomp and shew, and for better se∣curity
and conveniency of travel,
there are places assigned confining
upon the respective Countries whence
they usually come, where they meet
first either alone or in dispersed com∣panies;
such is <HI>Damascus</HI> for those
of <HI>Europe</HI> and the <HI>lesser Asia; Cairo</HI>
for the Inhabitants of <HI>Africa; Zi∣bet,</HI>
a City in <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> for the
people of <HI>Arabia</HI> and the Islands of
the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean; and <HI>Bagdat</HI> for
the <HI>Persians, Vsbeck Tartars,</HI> and
the Subjects of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> But this
obligation and command is dispen∣sable
in several cases. If they are
employed in the necessary service of
the Emperor, either about his per∣son,
or in the Wars, or in the Go∣vernment
of any Province. If they
be sickly, and so their health like to
be endangered by long travel; if
they are poor, and have not where∣withall
to maintain their Families
in their absence, or cannot furnish
themselves with necessaries for the
Voyage, and the like; so that it is
in a manner wholly left to their li∣berty
<PB N="72" REF="44"/>
and choice, and is to be mea∣sured
and directed by their conve∣nience
and interest. Yet notwith∣standing
there is so much of merit
in it, and such reputation gained,
every one thinking himself, as the
more holy, so the more fortunate, as
if they had gone to take possession
and secure themselves of a particu∣lar
place in Paradise, that several
thousands flock there continually
every year, and in their numbers at
least out-do the <HI>Christians,</HI> who live
among them, whose zeal and devo∣tion
carry them to visit the holy Se∣pulchre
of <HI>Jesus</HI> in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the
time of <HI>Easter.</HI> The ceremonies are
too many and too idle to be put
down here minutely and in detail;
the chiefest and most remarkable are
these which follow, as they were
communicated to me by a curious
and learned <HI>Renegado:</HI> They all af∣terward
meet on the Mountain <HI>Are∣phat,</HI>
not far from <HI>Mecca,</HI> and are
there at the farthest by the ninth
day of the month <HI>Dulhaggi,</HI> where
they sacrifice, and put on their holy
<PB N="73" REF="44"/>
Covering or Blanket, of which pre∣sently.</P>
<P>The <HI>Haggiler</HI> or Pilgrims put on
a white woollen Coat, and hang a∣bout
their necks a white Stole, all
their other Clothes being cast off,
pairing their Nails, cutting their
<HI>Mustachios</HI> and Beards, and shaving
their Pubes, Head, and Body, or
washing their Body, at least their
Head, Feet, and Hands, and after
perfume themselves and say their
prayers. By this they become <HI>Mu∣harrem</HI>
or <HI>devoted,</HI> and are obliged
to abstain from all obscenity of
language and strife, even from hunt∣ing
and looking after game, &amp; do not
dare so much as to kill a Louse, or
put on their other Clothes, Tur∣bants,
or Caps. Yet they may go
to a <HI>Bagno</HI> or House for shade, or
into a Bed.</P>
<P>Upon their entring <HI>Mecca,</HI> they
go strait to the first <HI>Mosch,</HI> and then
to the Black Stone, which they
foolishly imagine the <HI>Patriarch A∣braham</HI>
used to step upon to mount
his Camel, and say their prayers
<PB N="74" REF="45"/>
there, and kiss it and rub their Chap∣lets
of Beades upon it. The whose
remaining Ceremony consists in sa∣crificing
Sheep, in processions about
the wall of the Sepulchre of <HI>Maho∣met,</HI>
and to the neighbouring Moun∣tain,
and to the Rock, in which as
they pretend with the like certain∣ty,
are still to be seen the footsteps
of that <HI>Patriarch.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their visi∣ting of <HI>Je∣rusalem.</HI></NOTE> Several in their
return, to make their pilgrimage
compleat and more meritorious, vi∣sit
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for which they pre∣serve
a great veneration; the ordi∣nary
name whereby it is known and
called in their discourse, being <HI>Kuds,</HI>
or the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> or the <HI>holy City;</HI>
to which they add the additional
titles of <HI>Sherif</HI> and <HI>Mubarek,</HI> or
the <HI>noble and blessed holy City.</HI>
Here they come to worship and say
their prayers in the <HI>Mosch,</HI> which
is built upon the top of Mount <HI>Zion,</HI>
in the very place where <HI>Solomons</HI>
Temple stood, once the <HI>Mountain of
Gods holiness, and the joy of the
whole Earth, and still beautiful for
its situation.</HI> This like the Chap∣pel
<PB N="75" REF="45"/>
at <HI>Mecca,</HI> they esteem so holy,
that it is only lawful for a <HI>Musul∣man</HI>
to enter into it. If a <HI>Christian</HI>
or <HI>Jew</HI> should but lift up the Anti∣port,
and set one step into it, he pro∣faned
it, and indeed the penalty of
such a curiosity would be, as they
give out, no less than death, or at least
they would force them upon a necessi∣ty
of redeeming their life with the
loss and change of their Religion. Yet
some <HI>Greeks</HI> have been so curious,
who have spoke <HI>Turkish</HI> admirably
well, and known all the Rites and
Customs used in their Worship, as
to put on a Turbant and dissemble
their Religion, and enter boldly
therein, who report upon the best
survey and observation they could
make, they could see nothing extra∣ordinary
or differing from what was
in their other Churches. So that it
seems nothing but the holiness of
the ground in which it stands, de∣rives
upon it this great lustre and
veneration, and makes the <HI>Turks</HI>
so cautious and superstitious how
they admit strangers.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="46"/>
All upon their return are mighty
zealous in the observations of the
least punctilio's of the institutions
of <HI>Mahomet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their care of their be∣haviour up∣on their re∣turn from <HI>Mecca.</HI></NOTE> and particularly abhor
the very thought of Wine, or any
other prohibited liquor, and would
not drink a drop of this, if it were
to save their lives. Some put out
their eyes, who have been blest with
the sight of the Tomb of their
<HI>Prophet,</HI> as if they cared for nothing
in the world afterward. Others im∣pose
upon themselves a silence of
two, three, or four years, and some∣times
longer, and upon no provoca∣tion
or danger will open their
mouths to speak a word. This is
to several the great comfort and
triumph of their lives, that they
have been at <HI>Mecca;</HI> and for the
merit of those weary steps they
have taken, and of the prayers they
have offer'd up at <HI>Mahomets</HI> Shrine,
they flatter themselves they shall not
fail of entring Paradise, though in
all other things they be as very
<HI>Turks</HI> as they were before they set
one foot forward upon their jour∣ney.
<PB N="77" REF="46"/>
The <HI>Grand Signor</HI> every year
sends a considerable present to <HI>Mec∣ca,</HI>
and Clothes for the covering and
adornment of the Temple <HI>Kaabe,</HI>
at which time the old is taken down;
and happy is he who brings home
a rag of it with him, which he pre∣serves
ever after, as a holy relique
and a powerful Amulet against all
danger whatever; and with the same
care, as the Inhabitants of <HI>Catanea</HI>
do the Vail of St. <HI>Agatha</HI> against
the eruptions of <HI>Mongibel.</HI></P>
<P>The other principal Festival days
are these.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their other Festivals.</NOTE> On the twelfth night of
the month of the former <HI>Rabbia,</HI>
they celebrate the <HI>Birth of Maho∣met,</HI>
hanging out Lamps at their
<HI>Moschs,</HI> which with them is the most
usual sign and expression of their
triumphs and rejoicings. At this time
they employ all the wit and elo∣quence
they have, as little or as great
soever it is, but far different from
<HI>European,</HI> and indeed consists only
in phantastick and swelling expressi∣ons
after the <HI>Eastern</HI> way, flowing
from a gross and uncultivated fancy,
<PB N="78" REF="47"/>
without any great depth of reason or
sence; which practise might put se∣veral
<HI>Christians</HI> to the blush, if they
were not hardened into immodesty
and an obstinate humour by their
conceitedness, who refuse to pay that
respect to the memory of the Birth∣day
of their <HI>Saviour,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI>
so zealously pay to that of their false
<HI>Prophet.</HI></P>
<P>On the twenty-seventh night of
the month <HI>Regeb,</HI> is the Feast of
the <HI>Ascension of Mahomet into Hea∣ven;</HI>
a Fable so ridiculous in its
whole composition and circumstan∣ces,
that nothing but absolute sot∣tishness
can admit it as credible;
but yet as gross and foolish as it
is, they believe it with the same cer∣tainty,
as that there was such a

<P>The fifteenth night of <HI>Shaaban</HI>
is called <HI>Baratghege</HI> or the <HI>Night
of Priviledge,</HI> in which they say
was conveyed a Sword out of Heaven
into the hands of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and an
Instrument at the same time, com∣missioning
him to draw it, and make

use of it against the <HI>Christians</HI> and
all others, who should oppose the
propagation of the new Religion.</P>
<P>In the twenty-seventh night of
<HI>Ramazan,</HI> is the Feast of the <HI>Descent
of the Alcoran;</HI> which is the cause
why the <HI>Impostor</HI> thought fit to
consecrate the whole Month to more
than ordinary devotion, being the
holiest time of the year. And to
encourage them to spend this Festi∣val
in the exercises of Religion, they
keep up and support the credit and
reputation of it with a pretended
priviledge from <HI>God,</HI> that whatso∣ever
petitions they put up from
<HI>Jatzi,</HI> or an hour and half in the
night, until the Sky opens, (as they
speak) and the day appears, shall
be infallibly granted, and that <HI>God</HI>
has decreed and determined this;
and therefore they call the prayer
at this time <HI>Kadar namasi,</HI> or the
prayer of <HI>predestination.</HI></P>
<P>There is a fixt and established di∣stinction

<PB N="80" REF="48"/>
is often too consulted in Civil affairs

have little or no respect and depen∣dence
upon Religion; and so may
be lookt upon under the notion of
a supreme Judge under the Empe∣ror,
as well as of a Chief Priest. He
is the great Doctor and Oracle of
their Law, and Heir (as they speak)
of the Doctrine of the Prophets and
Apostles, the Fountain of vertue and
knowledge, one who can resolve all
the difficulties of Religion, and who
has a Key to open all the treasures
of truth; for by these and such like
foolish characters do they represent
him. Let him be never so dull and
stupid otherwise, either through a
natural incapacity, or age, or any
other defect, if he be preferred to
the <HI>Muftiship,</HI> as some have been
out of a capriccio by some Empe∣rors,
presently he becomes infalli∣ble;
his decisions are sacred and
authentick, and his authority is un∣questionable
and received without
any dispute or debate, and his dreams
are lookt upon as inspiration, as
<PB N="81" REF="48"/>
being <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s representative.
Though he poor man, conscious to
himself of the Cheat, uses to be
over-modest, and is ashamed to
assume this inerrable power, and
subscribes his Sentence with this
usual Expression, <HI>God knows better;</HI>
which is yet no bar to the Peoples
opinion and esteem of him; and no
one under the Emperour dares pass
judgment contrary to his determina∣tion.
To keep up this veneration of
the <HI>Musti</HI> in the People, the Empe∣rour
descends from his State, and as
soon as he appears before him, rises
up and advances leisurely six or
seven steps towards him, and per∣mits
him to kiss his left Shoulder;
whereas the chief <HI>Vizir</HI> is only per∣mitted
to kiss and salute the hem of
his Vest, though to do some little
honour to his first Minister he makes
a step or two forward to meet him.
The Emperour makes great use of
him in his private Councils, and
scarce sits upon a great design with∣out
his advice, to make it take the
more among the Souldiers and Peo∣ple,
<PB N="82" REF="49"/>
who assure themselves both
of the lawfulness, and convenience,
and necessity of an Expedition, and
flatter themselves too with the good
success of it, if it be ratifyed by his
consent, and blest by his Prayers
and encouragement. If reason of
State judg it necessary to strangle or
take off the head of a <HI>Vizir,</HI> any
other <HI>Bassa</HI> or General of the <HI>Jani∣zaries;</HI>
the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s consent will vin∣dicate
the execution, and stop the
clamours and discontents of the
Soldiers and People: who by this
are made to believe, that the person
cut off deserved to die according to
the Law; and that it is a piece of Reli∣gion
to submit to the Emperours
Pleasure, and the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s determi∣nation
noless than to the Will of <HI>God.</HI>
The Authority of the <HI>Mufti</HI> being
so great, the Emperour will not trust
a matter of that consequence to an
election, knowing that the keeping up
his Prerogative in the disposal of such
an office to a fit person, who shall
comply with his humour and the
necessity of State, is a just piece of
<PB N="83" REF="49"/>
Policy, on which may oftentimes
depend the safety and security of his
Person and Government. Although
usually he prefers one of the <HI>Cadile∣skires</HI>
into the place of the deposed
or dead <HI>Mufti,</HI> if he be for his turn;
But in case the <HI>Mufti</HI> should prove
resractory and disturb his Councels
by throwing in scruples of Con∣science,
and refuse to obey and con∣firm
his Orders, though they be
never so unjust and unreasonable,
they are not long to seek for a reme∣dy;
and as if the spirit of infallibi∣lity,
wherewith he was before in∣vested,
immediately upon this foolish
act of disobedience, left him to his
pure natural condition; then he is
said to dote, and to be infatuated,
and to forfeit his discretion and un∣derstanding,
and is hereby rendred
unworthy of so holy and super∣eminent
a dignity; and one presently
is substituted into his place, who
understands better the Arts of com∣pliance
and Courtship, and will re∣ceive
as an Oracle whatever comes
proposed to him out of the <HI>Sera∣glio.</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="50"/>
The <HI>Mufti</HI> by his place always
moves with the Emperour; none of
his Retinue more constantly attends
him, that he may be ready to assist
with his Councel at all times in case
of doubt or difficulty. This high
place lies in common to any one,
whom the Emperour shall think fit
to dignifie and honour with it, and
is not confined to the Kindred and
Posterity of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as some
through a mistake have affirmed.</P>
<P>I am fully assured the <HI>Mufti</HI> some∣times
acts as a meer Politician and
Counsellor of State, though the
advancement of Religion is always
the pretence, as it happened upon a
debate before the Emperour much
about the year 1669. when there
were dispatched two Gentlemen out
of <HI>Croatia</HI> with full Commission to
treat about their becoming tributa∣ry
to the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI> from seve∣ral
of the Nobles of the <HI>Roman</HI>
communion, who afterwards had
their heads struck off at <HI>Newstadt,</HI>
upon the assurance of his assistance
and protection against the Empe∣rour
<PB N="85" REF="50"/>
of <HI>Germany,</HI> whose Govern∣ment
they had shook off, and
thought to justifie and secure their
Rebellion this way. <HI>Mustapha Cai∣macam</HI>
of <HI>Adrianople</HI> was against
their being received, as being against
the Peace made so solemnly after the
battel of <HI>Rab;</HI> and besides very
politickly remarqued, it was no fit
time while they were involved in so
troublesom and expenseful a War
with the <HI>Venetians</HI> in <HI>Candia,</HI> to
bring the <HI>Germans</HI> upon their backs,
which would inevitably follow; but
the <HI>Mufti</HI> was as zealous and fierce
for their being taken into protection,
alledging that the <HI>Port</HI> was the
refuge of the world, and that the
Interest of Religion as well as of
State would be advanced by such an
acquist, which the Christians them∣selves
would maintain and make
good to them, and that this was of
greater obligation, than the strict
observing of a Treaty, that the mis∣fortunes
of the last <HI>Hungarian</HI> War
forced them to submit to. The Em∣perour
distracted with such different
<PB N="86" REF="51"/>
Counsels, would resolve nothing till
he had received the opinion of the <HI>Vi∣zir</HI>
then before <HI>Candia;</HI> but before
that could be brought back, they
had certain intelligence, that <HI>Croatia</HI>
was over run with an Army of Thir∣ty
thousand, and the whole force of
the discontented and rebellious No∣bility
defeated, and not an Acre of
Land left to plant a <HI>Turkish</HI> Gar∣rison
in.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Mufti</HI> are the two
<HI>Cadileskires,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cadiles∣kires.</NOTE> the one of <HI>Anatolia,</HI>
who has the precedence, and the
other of <HI>Rumuli</HI> or <HI>Thrace;</HI> the
authority of which latter, notwith∣standing,
the seeming restraint of
the name, is extended as far as the
<HI>Turk</HI> has any Dominions in <HI>Europe.</HI>
These formerly were, as their titles
literally signify, <HI>Judges of the Army;</HI>
and perpetually attended the Camp
to administer Justice among the
Souldiers, that so the Discipline of
War might receive support, and be
maintained, and kept up better by
the assistance of the Law; and little
quarrels that might arise among
<PB N="87" REF="51"/>
them, might be the more fairly de∣termined,
and capital punishments
inflicted according to the demerit
of the Criminals. This was the
design of their Original Institution;
but at present they only assist the
<HI>Vizir</HI> or his Deputy, in deciding
civil Causes, and exercise no autho∣rity
and power over the Souldiers,
who have long since extorted this
Priviledge from the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI>
to be tryed only by their respective
Commanders and Officers, They
have carried before them a Pole or
Spear, on the top of which hangs
horse-hair, as an Ensign of Honour;
to support which, besides what they
get by bribes and fees from the
parties contending, which are greater
or lesser proportionally to the quan∣tity
of the Sum, about which the
Suit is commenced, They have a
daily allowance of Five hundred
Aspers out of the Exchequer, accor∣ding
to the Canon established by the
Emperour <HI>Suleiman.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mollas</HI> challenge the third
place: who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mollas.</NOTE> under the <HI>Bassas,</HI> are
<PB N="88" REF="52"/>
Judges and Presidents of Provinces:
in the chief Cities of which they
reside, and to whom the <HI>Cadies</HI> or
inferiour Judges are obliged to give
an accompt of their Judicature.
Their pay is out of the Publick
Treasure, which is never less than
Three hundred Aspers a day, but
always under the allowance of the
<HI>Cadileskires.</HI> The first design and
intent of the allowance was agreea∣ble
to Equity and Justice, that they
might live handsomly and well, and
never be forced to descend to base
Arts and ways of gain, unworthy
their places, or be under the temp∣tation
of perverting the Law for
reward and gain. But this does not
satisfie and content their avarice,
who are not ashamed to extort Mo∣ney
and Presents from the several
Parties, who must this way defend
their Cause, if they would not have
it miscarry, be it never so just and
equitable in it self. This is the best
and most effectual Plea they can
possibly make: for certainly if Ju∣stice
be to be sold in any part of the
<PB N="89" REF="52"/>
world, it is in <HI>Turkey.</HI> For though
they may pretend Religion and Con∣science,
and may seem nice in deter∣mining
some Suits; yet it is both
known and sadly experienced, by
poor Christians especially, if they
implead any <HI>Turk,</HI> that they are
horribly corrupt, and men of no
faith or honesty, and judg the cause
on his side, who has given the
greatest bribe; though to free them∣selves
from the infamy and guilt of
injustice, they alledge several trickish
subtilties out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and
from Tradition, and to stave off the
injured person from pursuing his
right, and prosecuting his complaint.
These are reckoned among the num∣ber
of Church-men, the Law by
which they judge and determine
Cases, being as much a part of their
Religion, and founded in their <HI>Al∣coran</HI>
and <HI>Sunna</HI> or Tradition, as
the Rites of their Worship: and al∣though
they have nothing to do in
the <HI>Moschs,</HI> and sustain only the
office of Civil Judges; they are
accordingly advanced to the highest
<PB N="90" REF="53"/>
dignity a Church-man is capa∣ble
of.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Mosch</HI> has a Priest pecu∣liarly
belonging to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Imam,</HI> or Parish-Priest.</NOTE> who is called
<HI>Imaum.</HI> In the royal <HI>Moschs</HI> and
others that be endowed, several are
maintained, who take turns in cele∣brating
their office, or else for grea∣ter
Decorum and State officiate to∣gether.
A small proportion and
measure of Learning is a sufficient
qualification of a <HI>Turkish Priest;</HI>
there is no great need of any praevious
study, or a peculiar education and
designment to make any candidate
fit to take the care and Government
of a <HI>Mosch</HI> upon him. For the most
part if he can but read the Prayers,
and write and recite a few Versicles
out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and be no way
scandalous in his life, though he has
been at a Trade all his life long, he
is very capable, if he can get to be
nominated to fill up any vacancy;
and in case of any miscarriage or
unfitness degraded as it were from
his function, and he contentedly
returns to his Trade again, and one
<PB N="91" REF="53"/>
of his Neighbours is preferred into
his place. The great <HI>Vizir</HI> is Pa∣tron
of most of the richest <HI>Moschs;</HI>
the chief <HI>Mufti</HI> disposes of others;
the <HI>Kizlir-aga</HI> or chief of the black
Eunuchs recommends persons to
succeed in the vacant places of the
royal <HI>Moschs;</HI> the <HI>Capi-aga</HI> challen∣ges
a right, where any of the Pages
of the <HI>Haz-oda</HI> or Chamber have
been founders, as having been bred
up under the care of his Predecessors.
To other places of lesser value the
recommendation of the people is
sufficient, who upon producing his
Letters Testimonials to the <HI>Vizir,</HI> or
any of his Deputies appointed for
this purpose, are forthwith admitted
and confirmed. The greatest allow∣ance
as far as I could learn any of
these could pretend to, is Sixty
Aspers a day; though some are con∣tent
with a sixth part.</P>
<P>The vast number of Priests may be
collected from the great number of
Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great number of <HI>Moschs.</HI></NOTE> which are every where to
be met with. They stand very thick
in <HI>Constantinople, Pera</HI> and <HI>Galata,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="54"/>
and the Towns situated upon the
<HI>Bosphorus.</HI> In the Country the
poorest Village whatever has a
<HI>Mosch</HI> in it; and if it be large, two
or three; if the Inhabitants be <HI>Turks,</HI>
which I add, because some Christians
are permitted to live by themselves,
without the mixture of any <HI>Turks;</HI>
which is particularly indulged to
those, who live in Villages about
eight or ten Miles from <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI>
toward the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> and not far
from the <HI>black Sea</HI> (in one of which,
<HI>Belgrade,</HI> seated in the middle of a
Wood, my Lord Ambassador had his
<HI>Villa</HI> or Countrey-house) who are
obliged to take care, that the several
Channels, which convey the water
from the numerous Springs arising
not far off, be kept clear and unob∣structed,
and the water have a free
passage to the Aqueducts, the glo∣rious
work of <HI>Valentinian,</HI> and long
after restored to their former useful∣ness
and magnificence by <HI>Suleiman,</HI>
who for this one thing, if there had
been nothing of Victory and Con∣quest
else in his Reign, had deserved
<PB N="93" REF="54"/>
the title that usually is bestowed
upon him.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Moschs</HI> are endowed by
their respective Founders: for upon
no other condition are any allowed
to build. To preserve order and
unity among so great a number of
Priests in every great City, as <HI>Adri∣anople,
Prusia, Smyrna,</HI> and the like;
there is one who presides and exer∣cises
authority over the rest, who is
called <HI>Mufti,</HI> whom they consult
in all cases of ambiguity and doubt,
and whose Sentences and Orders
they dare not disobey.</P>
<P>Sometime in the greater Churches
Harangues and Discourses are had
before the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sermons.</NOTE> but not weekly
upon a <HI>Friday,</HI> or any other fixt
day, this not being the proper em∣ployment
of the ordinary <HI>Imaum,</HI>
or Parish-priest, whose Talents and
parts do not usually lye that way.
They are performed with a great
deal of seeming zeal, earnestness,
and devotion; their chief Argument
being a Religious or Moral duty, as
frequency of Prayer, Justice, Charity,
<PB N="94" REF="55"/>
and the like. These Preachers, whom
they call <HI>Scheicks,</HI> who have had
their Education in a Colledge or
Convent, and have spent their time
in the study of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and
its several Commentaries, are migh∣tily
followed, and had in great ve∣neration,
and what with their flu∣ency
of language, and pretensions to
extraordinary measures of devotion
and cunning, have a strange kind of
influence upon the people, and some∣time
are made use of as fit and pro∣per
instruments to work upon
them.</P>
<P>Besides these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Readers of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI></NOTE> several are by their
places and offices to read the <HI>Alco∣ran.</HI>
Of which sort are about thir∣ty
in number in some of the royal
<HI>Moschs,</HI> who either there, or in the
Chappels adjoyning, where the Em∣perours
and the Great Men lye in∣terred,
read over the <HI>Alcoran</HI> every
day, each one taking his Section.
To which are joyned others, who
have a Pension allowed them to
come there, and say daily Prayers
for the dead. The rest who belong
<PB N="95" REF="55"/>
to their <HI>Moschs,</HI> are inferiour Offi∣cers
and Servants of the Priests,
whose employment is to call to
Prayers, to look to the <HI>Alcoran</HI>
and Prayer-Books, to take care of
the Mats and Carpets, to light the
Lamps, to keep the Church neat and
clean, and the like.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadyes</HI> are the inferiour Ju∣stices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cadyes.</NOTE>
placed almost in every Vil∣lage
to see good order kept among
the people, to administer Law and
Justice, to decide Differences, and
to punish Offenders, which they do
with severity enough, unless they
buy off their punishment. This
power they usually buy at a dear
rate; and that they may be no losers
by the bargain, they sell Justice as
dear, and upon every slight occa∣sion,
oppress the poor Christians,
make <HI>Avanias,</HI> and demand Sums
of Money upon a pretended fault or
breach of the Law, and oftentimes
force Travellers to give them so
much Money in <HI>specie,</HI> as they set
upon their heads. Such greedy Ex∣tortioners
are they, as most <HI>Francs</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="56"/>
know, who have travelled far into
the Countrey, by their sad expe∣rience.
As for Presents, they expect
them of course upon their first com∣ing
into their Towns; and as if they
were due and recoverable by Right
and Law, as well as by injustice and
violence, if we have been a little
slow in making them, they have
sent an Officer to demand them.
For as soon as the News of the arri∣val
of any <HI>Western Christian</HI> is
brought to the <HI>Cady,</HI> he seems sure
of a prey. Before we stirred out of
our <HI>Caravan-serai,</HI> which the piety
of the <HI>Turks</HI> hath built for the use
and accommodation of Travellers, to
view the Antiquities of any place,
we were first to obtain the leave of
the <HI>Cady</HI> by a Present of Coffee, or
Pepper, or Sugar, and sometime of
all three; and unless we had done
so, we could have had no security,
(for by some devilish trick or other
he would have put us to a greater
trouble and expence) which toge∣ther
with the necessary guard of
Souldiers to attend, makes travel∣ling
<PB N="97" REF="56"/>
so dear and chargeable in <HI>Tur∣key.</HI>
Coming to Anchor on the
North-side of the Castles at the
<HI>Dardanels,</HI> where is the narrowest
strait of the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> as they
force all Ships to do that come from
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> and to lie there
three Suns to search them, if they
have no Contraband Goods or
Slaves, which have made their es∣cape
from their Patrons; we went
ashore, and had scarce past through
a Street or two in <HI>Sestos,</HI> but we
were overtaken by an Officer sent
from the Governour to bring us be∣fore
him: we understood the mean∣ing
of it, and therefore in our way
to the Castle bought some Coffee
Powder, for a Present, which we put
into his hands, who after some idle
questions dismist us. But for the
most part in our Land-voyages, we
prevented the demands of the seve∣ral
<HI>Cadyes,</HI> out of which number I
except the rascally Cady of <HI>Sardes:</HI>
He hearing that there were several
Franks got into the publick Chane,
very imperiously sent for his Pre∣sent;
<PB N="98" REF="57"/>
we replied, that we had the
Emperor's Pass to exempt us from
all injury and exaction, and to tra∣vel
unmolested; for such a one two
English Gentlemen had procured at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> passing thence over
land to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which they gave us
to make the best use we could of it
in our Voyage to the <HI>Churches.</HI> But
the truth is, we did not rely so much
upon the Pass, as our number and
the weakness of the Village: For
this once glorious City the Metro∣polis
of <HI>Lydia,</HI> which has nothing
of its ancient glory and state left,
unless that the great ruines shew
what it has been before Earthquakes
and War, and the barbarousness of
the <HI>Turks</HI> had caused those horrid
and frightful desolations there, is
become a very pitiful and despica∣ble
place, made up of a few Hutts
and Cottages. Pretending to be sa∣tisfied
with the sight of our Pass∣port,
he counterfeits respect and
civility, and desires us to give him
but half a Dollar; but by the ad∣vice
of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> we did not
<PB N="99" REF="57"/>
think fit to give him, being such a
low-spirited Fellow, not so much as
a single Asper; upon which denial
he could not contain his weak pas∣sion,
and therefore severely forbids
a poor Christian, that we employed
in buying us some Provisions, to be
any way assisting to us. Afterward
when we were at leisure to reflect
upon what we had done, we began
to condemn our selves or our Im∣prudence,
that might have given us
so much trouble, which for so small
a Sum as was demanded, might have
been better prevented, being after∣ward
sensible, that neither our
Swords nor Pass might have been
of sufficient proof against his rage
and madness.</P>
<P>They look upon the <HI>Alcoran</HI>
as containing not onely the Word
and Will of <HI>God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcoran.</NOTE> dictated by the
Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> con∣cerning
the Rites and manners of his
Worship, but the body of the Civil
Law referring to matters of Justice
and Government; and therefore, as
I said before, use its authority in
<PB N="100" REF="58"/>
the decision of Cases that happen
daily in conversation and commerce;
and where it is defective, as it must
needs be, they call in to their assist∣ance
their <HI>Sunna,</HI> made up of the
Sayings and Acts of their <HI>Prophet,</HI>
derived down to them by Oral
tradition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunna <HI>or</HI> Tradition.</NOTE> from Father to Son, as
they pretend, and of equal autho∣rity
with the holy Book: and
because innumerable cases happen,
that are so perplext and confused,
that neither written nor traditional
Law have made any provision for
them, equity and right reason are to
interpose and determine, but no
where are less practised than in
<HI>Turkey,</HI> where the <HI>Cadyes</HI> make all
to bend to their covetous humour;
and yet to keep the fraud from
being discovered, wrest some ob∣scure
sentence of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in de∣fence
and favour of their unjust de∣termination.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadyes</HI> are necessarily bred
up in the knowledge of the <HI>Maho∣metan</HI>
Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colledges</NOTE> to qualifie and fit them
for their office; to which purpose
<PB N="101" REF="58"/>
there are Colledges, endowed by
Emperors and great men in most of
the great Cities, for the Education
of Youth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Professors.</NOTE> and Professors, men of
great age and experience and learn∣ing,
appointed to direct and go∣vern
their Studies, whose office and
place procure them great respect
among the people, they seldom
walking in the Streets, but are
mounted upon excellent horses,
richly caparison'd, which is indeed
the usual Grandezza of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
and what all men of authority and
fashion use, having two or three
Slaves walking by.</P>
<P>Some of these receive for their
Salary about three hundred Aspers
a day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Al∣lowance.</NOTE> and oftentimes are preferred
to a Mollaship, whom they presume
by their long study to have digested
the whole Law, and to be perfect
Masters of it: They are obliged to
teach publickly the young Students
twice a week, on Saturday and
Monday, and to exact an account
of their behaviour, and of the pro∣gress
of their Studies: and if upon
<PB N="102" REF="59"/>
examination they find the success
answerable to their expectation;
after a set time they have the de∣gree
and title of <HI>Danishmend</HI> or
<HI>Learned</HI> conferred on them. Each
has his Cell, over a set number of
which is placed a Supervisor to pre∣vent
idleness and the practice of
worse vices. According to the fame
of their merit, some are preferred
to places of Judicature▪ others to
rich Moschs, who together with
some of the Dervises bred up in
their Convents, prove the great
Preachers, and have that mighty
influence upon the people, as be∣fore
was mentioned.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Cady,</HI> besides an Actuary
and Apparitor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officers un∣der the Ca∣dyes.</NOTE> and such like Offi∣cers,
has his <HI>Naip</HI> or Assistant,
who sees that the Weights are just,
and the Provisions which are
brought to the Market, be wholsom,
and sold at a moderate price; for
which purpose they walk the Streets
and enter into Shops, and those of
Bakers especially, whose bread if
they find wanting of its just weight,
<PB N="103" REF="59"/>
besides a pecuniary mulct they im∣pose,
they oftentimes throw them
into Prison; or if the fraud be but
light, they bring them out and
drub them upon the place. But for
all this pretended justice and seve∣rity,
if they bribe but the Officer
before-hand, they may cheat the
people securely.</P>
<P>I found the <HI>Turks</HI> excessively
pitiful and good natured towards
dumb creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turks piti∣ful to dumb creatures.</NOTE> soon putting them
out of their pain, if they were ne∣cessitated
to kill them. Some buy
birds on purpose to let them fly a∣way
and return to the liberty of the
Woods and open air. The Vultures
fly up and down the Courts of the
great houses in the City, as if they
had perceived by natural instinct,
that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whose birds they are
fancied to be, had forbid under a
penalty any one to shoot at them.
The Storks, which in the Spring∣time
return out of the Southern Cli∣mates
to the very same Nests the
sharpness of the Winter drove them
from, enjoy their natural liberty
<PB N="104" REF="60"/>
without the least molestation; and
if at any time in our travels we
shot at them, our <HI>Janizaries</HI> would
take it amiss, and look upon it as
ominous, as if some mischief would
certainly befall us for our cruelty
to the poor innocent birds. For
though they use hawking, and take
them with Birdlime, and sometime
use their Guns and eat their flesh,
yet they are not very much accu∣stomed
to such dainties, and never
kill them for the sport and pleasure
of it, especially if they are not pro∣per
and good for food; which is the
reason of the great number of Cor∣morants
and other revenous Fowl
hovering over the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> and
the arm of the Sea that divides <HI>Pe∣ra</HI>
from <HI>Constantinople.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their love of Dogs.</NOTE> But above
all they seem to have a peculiar
love and kindness for Dogs, which
yet are the ugliest and of the worst
Race that ever I saw. They will not
indeed admit them into their hou∣ses,
because they are unclean crea∣tures;
but however lest the Winter-air
should be too sharp and piercing,
<PB N="105" REF="60"/>
there are distinct Kennels in every
street, to which they peculiarly
belong, and a daily provision is
made of water put into hollow Pits.
I have observed some mighty ten∣der-hearted
<HI>Janizaries</HI> go to a Ba∣kers
shop and buy an Asper or two
of bread to bestow by way of cha∣rity
upon them: when at the same
time, if a poor Christian had been
ready to perish for want of a little
relief, the sight of such a miserable
object would have no way moved
them to pity: and though they are
so troublesom, in the night especi∣ally,
no one dares either stab them
or poyson them without danger of
being stabb'd himself if the fact
were discovered. How idly and
fondly superstitious they are here∣in,
will appear by the ensuing re∣lation,
which though it hapned in
the time of <HI>Achmet,</HI> yet still holds
true, and represents their present
temper. The Plague raging very
hot, the Emperour and the Bassas
at last seemed to make a mighty
discovery, that it was necessary to
<PB N="106" REF="61"/>
destroy the Dogs in and about <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
to prevent the further
spreading of the Infection: but the
<HI>Mufti,</HI> who was consulted in this
weighty Affair, would by no means
give way to so bloody and cruel a
sentence, maintaining it was alto∣gether
unlawful; and that he might
not seem to be peremptory without
cause, he added this momentous
reason, that <HI>Dogs had souls,</HI> and
therefore were to be exempt from
this universal and horrid carnage.
But it was a plain case, so great a
number of Dogs was a real mischief:
what therefore was to be done in
this great strait and perplexity of
mind? Upon the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s sentence
they recalled the former order a∣bout
their slaughter, and resolved to
transport them over the Water to
<HI>Asia</HI>-side; above fifty thousand were
found upon the Muster, and carried
over to <HI>Scutary</HI> and the Neigh∣bouring
places: but though they
were out of sight, yet they were
not out of mind; and their care of
them seemed to be doubled, and
<PB N="107" REF="61"/>
Provisions were sent daily over to
keep life and soul together, in com∣pliance
with the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s learned and
philosophical determination; till at
last growing weary of the expence
and trouble, and fearing they might
infect the places where they were,
with great trouble and reluctancy
of mind they conveyed them to some
of the uninhabited Islands that lie
in the <HI>Propontis</HI> toward the Bay of
<HI>Nicomedia,</HI> where they were famish∣ed.
But the City since is so pester'd
with them, that I believe if a new
Muster were now made, the number
would be found to be greater. No
one must offer to kick or touch any
of them; if a Christian does this
by chance, they impute it to his
hatred and ill will, and will be sure
to chide, if not beat him for it: as
one in a great fury askt a <HI>Christian,</HI>
who through great haste and care∣lesness
trod upon a Mangey Curr,
that lay in the way, <HI>Thou Infidel,
how dost thou know, but that thy
fathers soul is in that poor dog?</HI>
shewing by this his love to the
<PB N="108" REF="62"/>
dog, and his zeal for his opinion:
for he was one of those who main∣tained
the idle Pythagorean dream
of a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or transmigration of
Souls.</P>
<P>They still retain the absurd prin∣ciple
of fate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The opini∣on of Fate.</NOTE> which is the genuine
issue of their gross ignorance and
barbarousness. This makes them
encounter the greatest dangers of
Death with such desperate boldness;
fearless and secure, as to their
thoughts, in the time of a raging
Plague. The contagion does not
hinder them from visiting persons
infected, with the same freedom, as
if they were only sick of an ordi∣nary
Fever; they wipe their faces
with the Handkerchiefs of their
dead Friends, and put on the very
cloaths they but lately died in:
their confidence being grounded
upon this foolish belief, that every
man's destiny is written in his fore∣head,
and not to be prevented or
kept off by care or Medicine, that
the term of life is fatal and perem∣ptory,
and that it is in vain to go
<PB N="109" REF="62"/>
about to extend it beyond the set
Period; and that Physick is to be
taken not to prolong life, but to
take off from the anguish and bit∣terness
of death, and to make the
pangs of it the more tolerable and
easie: and that it is a piece of folly
to think to escape. This error de∣stroys
thousands of them yearly,
who hasten their own death by their
conceitedness and folly: which is
true of the common people espe∣cially,
in whose minds this fancy
is so rooted, that they think it a
kind of Sin as well as weakness to re∣linquish
their houses, and retire to
more wholsom air; what, say they,
is not the Plague the dart of the
<HI>Almighty God?</HI> and can we escape
the blow that he levels at us? is not
his hand steady to hit the persons
he aims at? can we run out of his
sight, and beyond his power? thus
calling in the belief of some of the
Divine Attributes to the maintain∣ance
of it. Indeed some of the
<HI>Cadyes,</HI> who seem to be the only
men of deep sence and understand∣ing
<PB N="110" REF="63"/>
among them, are aware of the
pernicious consequences of this Do∣ctrine,
and when the Plague grows
hot and violent, provide for the
safety of their Families by a timely
flight into the neighbouring Villa∣ges,
where they keep them till the
fury of it is spent; while entire
Families (and one I heard of in
our time in <HI>Galata</HI> consisting of six
and thirty persons) which have stay'd
behind, have been destroy'd.</P>
<P>The Plague necessarily diffuses its
Poison among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plague rages a∣mong them often.</NOTE> having no An∣tidotes
and Preservatives against it,
or Remedies to make use of when
it has seized upon them: By such a
general neglect and promiscuous
mixing one with another the di∣stemper
is heightned, and makes
great wastes, especially toward the
end of Summer, when the heats are so
excessive, and the Fruits, and the
Melons and the Gourds ripen, which
both <HI>Turks, Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI>
much indulge themselves in. <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>
is scarce all the year long
free from the Plague, although it
<PB N="111" REF="63"/>
remits of its fury in the cold wea∣ther,
the nastiness of several places
of the City, and the stoppage of
their common shores, and the dead
dogs putrifying in their streets con∣tributing
much to it; which the
wiser sort cannot but acknowledg;
but they are so used to the Plague,
that they are not much solicitous
about it. They do not think of ma∣king
any publick Prayers and In∣tercessions,
till a thousand bodies
are carried daily out at <HI>Adrianople</HI>
Gate to the publick places of Burial,
which lye in the plain without the
City, and are extended from the
<HI>Propontis</HI> to the Haven. For though
it be an arrow that cannot be put by,
yet they acknowledg it is in the
hand of God, and that he can stop
it if he pleases; and so are forced
at last to acknowledg the weakness
and falsity of their own Principle.
At such times, as also when the
affairs of the Empire are in an ill
posture by reason of War, the <HI>Grand
Signior</HI> and <HI>Mufti</HI> attended by the
<HI>Bassas,</HI> and a great number of Priests
<PB N="112" REF="64"/>
in solemn procession, pass over the
Water to <HI>Pera</HI>-side, where upon a
high hill a little above <HI>Kasim Basha</HI>
in that part of it they call <HI>Okmi∣dan,</HI>
where at other times the bet∣ter
sort of <HI>Turks</HI> use to shoot (which
is one of their greatest exercises) on
the edge of it toward the South-east
is a little Square of about twenty pa∣ces
long, andas many broad, hemm'd
in with Freestone about two foot
from the ground, where I found a
stony Pulpit ascended to by ten
steps; on the top of which the
<HI>Mufti</HI> makes his prayers: after
which Ceremony is over, they think
they have done all they can do, and
leave off all further care. This is
their great argument of comfort up∣on
the death of their friends, that
it is the decree and pleasure of <HI>God,</HI>
which they are to submit to, and
that all humane counsels and reme∣dies
are ineffectual against his will,
(which is a great truth in it self, but
very much misapplied by them)
and that so long they are to live, and
not a minute longer: as I remember a
<PB N="113" REF="64"/>
<HI>Turk</HI> who escaped being buried un∣der
the ruines of a wall, that fell as
he past by, said, when he was reco∣ver'd
from his surprize, <HI>Egel ghel∣medi,</HI>
that <HI>the hour of his death
was not yet come,</HI> without giving
God thanks for his great delive∣rance.</P>
<P>Some of them indeed seem to
have a great reverence and fear of
God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their reve∣rence of God.</NOTE> which they shew both by their
gestures and discourses, whensoever
they have occasion to mention his
name; referring all things, not on∣ly
the events of war, or any great
undertaking, but of a journey, and
the private concerns of their life, to
his will and disposal, ratifying their
promise and purpose with this con∣dition,
<HI>In Shallah, if God will;</HI>
beginning nothing of any moment,
not stepping out of their door, nor
mounting a Horse but in the name
of <HI>God.</HI> In any danger or distress
they quiet their fears, and encou∣rage
others not to despond, with
the remembrance of the mercy,
power, and goodness of God, often
<PB N="114" REF="65"/>
crying out, <HI>Allah karim, God is
gracious, Allah ekbir, God is great,</HI>
and the like; out of a sense of their
own weakness, flying to God to
help and protect them; and when
the danger is over, the journey fi∣nished,
or the design accomplisht to
their satisfaction, they repeat often
these words, <HI>Alhemdo lillah, praise
to God,</HI> by way of gratitude and
acknowledgment. This is the tem∣per
of some of the more religious
among them.</P>
<P>There are others who run into
the extreme of irreligion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atheists among them.</NOTE> Atheists
in their hearts and in their lives;
among which I may reckon justly
enough the greatest part of the <HI>Ca∣dyes,</HI>
and almost all the <HI>Apostate
Christians.</HI> These latter, who con∣scious
to themselves of horrid crimes,
which the Laws of <HI>Christendom</HI> have
made capital; or else of dissolute
lives, and wallowing in brutality,
that they may enjoy their lusts more
freely, and without check and re∣morse
of conscience, embrace the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, look upon it
<PB N="115" REF="65"/>
and all other Religions as a meer
cheat, and by their lives shew the
disesteem of them. The other be∣ing
men whose understandings are
somewhat refined by their educa∣tion
from the stupidity and dulness
of the ordinary <HI>Turks,</HI> sensible of
the idle fopperies of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
and of the imposture of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
and of the absurdities of his Do∣ctrine,
and the inconsistency of it
with the principles of right Rea∣son,
rashly conclude of Religion in
general, that it is a trick of State,
and an invention of Policy; and that
the belief of a <HI>God</HI> and of Provi∣dence
is wholly owing to the cre∣dulity
and superstition and unjust
fears of mankind. Only they are
so wise and cunning to conceal
their Atheism, which they are so
justly suspected to be guilty of, for
fear of the great danger an open
profession of it would involve them
in. For the <HI>Turks</HI> are mighty zea∣lous
for the existence of a Deity
against the Atheist, and think such
a person not worthy to breath in
<PB N="116" REF="66"/>
the air, who dares deny this fun∣damental
principle of nature. And
the example of such a just severity
is very fresh in their memories,
as hapning in the year of Christ
M.DC.LXI, upon a certain <HI>Maho∣metan,</HI>
which I shall here put down
from the mouths of credible per∣sons,
who knew the man very fa∣miliarly.
This <HI>Mahomet Ephendi</HI>
(which is a title of respect they
usually bestow upon men of learn∣ing
and authority) was born
in <HI>Larr</HI> in <HI>Armeuia major,</HI> a man
of great esteem in <HI>Constantinople</HI>
among all who knew him, for his
skill in the Law, and in the <HI>Ara∣bick</HI>
and <HI>Persian</HI> languages, of a
temper mild and sociable, which
made him covet the acquaintance
and friendship of several <HI>Western
Christians,</HI> from whom he could
learn somewhat, and whom he ac∣knowledged
to understand the laws
of discourse, and to reason much
better than his Brother <HI>Turks,</HI> whom
he lookt upon as very dull and hea∣vy
fellows. His inquisitive genius
<PB N="117" REF="66"/>
put him upon the search of several
things, and his pride and conceit∣edness
were so great, that he thought
he had found the secret indeed,
which all the Atheists have been
seeking after to quiet and banish
those fears which perpetually haunt
their guilty minds. Ambitious of
fame and applause, he sets up for a
profest Atheist, being so far from
suppressing these extravagant fancies,
the effect of the greatest madness
whatever, that he takes care to divulge
them in all companies where he
thought to meet with opposition,
and disputes fiercely against the be∣ing
of a <HI>God.</HI> Whenever he went
to visit <HI>Signor Warner,</HI> whose ex∣traordinary
learning and worth de∣rived
a great lustre upon his pub∣lick
character, the first salute upon
the very sight of him was, <HI>there is
not,</HI> meaning a <HI>God;</HI> to which the
<HI>Resident</HI> would immediately reply,
<HI>there is;</HI> after which they would
often descend to a close dispute
about that dictate of universal na∣ture,
and right reason; but he had
<PB N="118" REF="67"/>
so hardned his heart against all
conviction, and blinded his mind
and understanding with absurd and
irrational prejudices, and foolish and
vain imaginations, that though he
could not well sustain the mighty
shock of arguments which the learn∣ed
<HI>Resident</HI> level'd at him, yet he
flatter'd himself he could fully sa∣tisfie
them all, and that he had the
better of him. But in the miserable
end of this wretch the Divine justice
was as much seen as if he had been
consum'd by Lightning from Hea∣ven.
There hapning in the publick
<HI>Caravanserai,</HI> where he lodged, a
quarrel between him and some <HI>Ar∣menian
Christian</HI> Merchants, they
carried him before the <HI>Caimacam,</HI>
who is the Governour of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
who had for his Assistant
the chief Justice of the City, whom
they call <HI>Stambol Ephendi.</HI> The in∣jury
he had done the <HI>Armenians</HI>
was proved by several Witnesses;
and in the close the <HI>Turks,</HI> who
were present, acquainted the Judges
of the temper of the man, and accused
<PB N="119" REF="67"/>
him of several impieties he was
guilty of, as that he never came to
the prayers of the <HI>Mosch,</HI> neglected
the other rites instituted by their
<HI>Prophet,</HI> drank Wine freely, and
that in the time of <HI>Ramazan;</HI> and
besides, that he openly maintained
that there was no <HI>God.</HI> The con∣testation
through the zeal of the
<HI>Turks</HI> grew very hot, and matter
of fact seemed to be fully made
out by just proof. Whereupon the
Governour demanded of him, what
he could say for himself? whether
the evidence against him were true
or no? here several unanimously
agree, that you deny the being of
a <HI>God.</HI> He replied without any de∣mur
or feat, you would be of the
same mind if you knew as much as
I know. They advise him, if he
valued his life, to retract his foolish
and impious opinion, otherwise they
would pass the sentence of death
upon him. They give him time to
consider of it, and expect that what∣ever
his private sentiments were, fear
of death would make him confess
<PB N="120" REF="68"/>
his belief of a Deity. But it seems
he would be a Martyr for his A∣theism,
and chose rather to dye than
confess he was in an error, and dis∣semble
his inward thoughts; where∣upon
he is sentenced to dye; he con∣tinues
as perverse and obstinate as
ever, even in the last moments of
his life. For being set upon a Mule
with his face toward the tail, and
carried to the place of punishment,
and admonisht by the <HI>Subashi</HI> or
Officer, who attended upon the ex∣ecution,
to recant his error; his
only answer was, that the filth (for
so I chuse modestly to express it) he
was to eat he would eat presently;
meaning by the rude Proverb, that
he was willing to dye as soon as
might be. Thus he perisht in his
folly, being between fifty and six∣ty
years of age, and leaving a con∣siderable
sum of money behind him,
infatuated by the just judgment of
<HI>God,</HI> which became most visible in
his deserved ruine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Janizaries</HI> are the strength
of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Janizaries.</NOTE> anciently
<PB N="121" REF="68"/>
the Sons of <HI>Christians,</HI> violently ta∣ken
from their Parents at six and
seven years of age, as it pleased
the Collectors, sent into <HI>Bosna</HI> and
<HI>Servia</HI> and the other Provinces of
<HI>Europe</HI> (for by common observa∣tion
they find the <HI>Asiaticks</HI> to make
the worst Souldiers, the pleasant∣ness
of the Soil, and the mildness
of the Air having an influence upon
their tempers) who take one or two
out of a Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Col∣lection.</NOTE> if it be numerous;
and these afterward embracing a
new Religion, razing out the obli∣gations
of nature, and by their se∣vere
education hardned against all
impressions of pity and good nature,
prove the greatest plagues and tor∣mentors
of their Relations, and are
the cruel instruments of their ser∣vitude.
The collection of these <HI>Chil∣dren
of Tribute,</HI> is not triennial, as
some have fancied, but happens soo∣ner
or later according to the ne∣cessities
of State, and as the num∣ber
and proportion of Souldiers is
to be more or less supplied. <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
and very many other
<PB N="122" REF="69"/>
places are to the great joy and
comfort of the poor <HI>Christian</HI> in∣habitants
exempted from this dis∣mal
exaction, and particularly all
<HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Wallachia;</HI> but these
Countries being tributary and un∣der
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Government, the
respective Princes, which they con∣stitute
and put out as they please,
are obliged to appear with such a
number of Horsemen in the Field,
when the Scene of the War lies
either in <HI>Hungary</HI> or <HI>Poland,</HI> and
by this means they enlarge their Con∣quests
in <HI>Christendom</HI> by the Arms
of professed <HI>Christians.</HI> These Chil∣dren
are called <HI>Agiamoglans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Agiamo∣glans.</NOTE> that
is, <HI>rude and unexperienced Boys,</HI>
whereof some are dispersed into se∣veral
parts of the Country, that
they may the better be enured to
want and labour and hardship, and
initiated in the Principles and Rites
of <HI>Mahometanism,</HI> and learn the
<HI>Turkish</HI> language. Others are pla∣ced
in certain Colledges, built on
purpose for their reception, (of
which sort is that at <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="69"/>
and another at <HI>Pera,</HI> hard by the
Palace, the ordinary Mansion of
the <HI>English</HI> Ambassadors successive∣ly)
which are the Seminaries of the
Youth of this Order, and where
they pass their novitiate. Here they
are under the eye of most rigorous,
severe and cruel Masters, and are for∣ced
to the vilest offices, to mortifie
them, and make them humble and
obedient; here they are taught to be
at the command of a beck or nod,
and if any way faulty, are sure to re∣ceive
a severe chastisement; here
they learn the first principles and
rudiments of War. This is according
to their original institution by <HI>Morat,</HI>
the first who setled this <HI>new Militia</HI>
or Army, as the word <HI>Janizary</HI> sig∣nifies;
which out of respect to the
Founder and Order is still retain'd.
But there discipline of late years
has not been kept up to this great
height of severity, but is very much
relaxed and corrupted. And be∣cause
that according to the usual
maxime of policy, which experience
hath so often confirmed and rendred
<PB N="124" REF="70"/>
little less than infallible, Empires are
kept and preserved by the same arts
wherewith they were first establisht,
which ceasing, they begin to moulder
into pieces: We may look upon this
decay of discipline as a good omen,
that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, which has
been rais'd to that great pitch and
degree of glory, upon the ruin of
so many Kingdoms and Govern∣ments,
grows towards an end; the
same fate usually attending Govern∣ments,
as single persons, that after
a set period of years, broken with
intestine factions and divisions, or
weakned with idleness and the
charmes and delights of a long and
uninterrupted peace they perish and
decay. They are not now so solicitous
to fill up those seminaries with
<HI>Agiamoglans,</HI> which anciently were
accounted the hope and growing
strength of the Empire; and in∣deed
of late years they have spent
such a vast number of Soldiers in the
Wars, that they cannot get supplies
hence fast enough to serve the ne∣cessities
of War. A very considera∣ble
<PB N="125" REF="70"/>
part of the veterance Soldiers
was lost in <HI>Candia,</HI> which they them∣selves
have called the burying place
of <HI>Musulmans.</HI> For by a very just
calculation from their first landing in
the Island, and sitting down before <HI>Ca∣nea</HI>
to the surrender of the chief City,
what by Plague and what by Sword
and Mine above four hundred thou∣sand
perisht there; the tediousness
and disadvantages of the War were
so grievous and irksome to them, that
the <HI>Janizaries</HI> went thither very un∣willingly
and without any heart to
fight, who dread all expeditions by
Sea, upbraiding the Emperor with the
misfortunes and ill success of the de∣sign,
while their Country was impove∣rish't
by the <HI>Temins,</HI> a false Coin of
mixt and base mettal, (which were
imported in vast quantities by the
<HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants) &amp; that
the Soldiers were thrown away in
<HI>Crete,</HI> &amp; yet for all this, that he went
a hunting. To supply the Siege, which
made such continual wastes of them,
I have known several country fellows
taken from the plough, and enrolled
<HI>Janizaries</HI> without any previous ex∣ercises
<PB N="126" REF="71"/>
of arms. Formerly all the
<HI>Constantinopolitan Janizaries</HI> were
quartered in two spacious hou∣ses
under the banners of their re∣spective
officers, and kept guard
and watch; but now for a little pre∣sent
they are dispenst from this at∣tendance,
and are permitted to marry,
and accordingly several make use of
the indulgence; the cares of the
world put them upon arts of gain to
maintain themselves and their fami∣lies;
and natural affection takes off
their minds from the pursuit and
love of armes, and makes them chuse
rather to lye at home in their houses
than go into the field. They are
busied in the management of trade,
and turn shop-keepers, and by an idle
and sedentary kind of life remit much
of their warlike ambition and fierce∣ness,
and are become soft and effemi∣nate;
all their thoughts and wishes
being for peace and quiet. But how∣ever,
the privileges of the <HI>Janiza∣ries</HI>
being so great and the name
honourable, they get their children
admitted into the same order; of
<PB N="127" REF="71"/>
which they are very tender and soli∣citous;
and lest they should any
way be diminish't by any publick
council or trick of State, there are
several of their order, (I think about
twelve, whom they call <HI>Ogiack A∣galer</HI>)
constituted as so many Tri∣bunes
to take care of them. These
Agitators are the men whom they
respect as their Patrons and defen∣ders,
and who have such a great
power and influence upon them. If
they give but the word, they are
presently up in arms, and the <HI>Pi∣azzas</HI>
and Streets are full of se∣ditious
tumults, and the <HI>Seraglio</HI>
it self not safe from their assaults.
For they know well enough that
the Government is jealous of their
strength, that it is in their power
either to depose or make what Em∣peror
they please, that they are the
safeguard of the Empire; that <HI>Osman</HI>
uncle to this Emperor had a design
of destroying their whole order, and
setting up another, which should be
more at command and not so dange∣rous
to the publick, as they are up∣on
<PB N="128" REF="72"/>
every discontent; that his succes∣sors
carry on the same evil designs
against them, and that it is want of
a good opportunity, that hinders
them from putting the same in exe∣cution
and practice. Whence arise
their care and their fears; and pro∣portionably
their pride and insolence
and extravagant demands of greater
priviledges encrease, and the distrust
they have of the Emperor makes
them unite more closely and shew a
greater regard and respect to their
officers, who manage their interest.
They are wholly exempt from the
civil jurisdiction, be the crime never
so directly contrary to the Laws;
they are only triable among them∣selves:
if it be judged and pro∣ved
capital, before they execute
the sentence, they first strike his
name out of the Register, and then
do it privately and in the night, to
prevent the disorders this unruly
sort of men are too apt to be guilty
of. In every City and large Town,
where they abound, there is a supe∣rior
officer, whom they call <HI>Serdar,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="72"/>
to whose jurisdiction they are ob∣noxious.
He according to his or∣ders,
sent either from the <HI>Vizir</HI> or
<HI>Janizary Aga</HI> or General, musters
those who are within his Province,
and disposes of them according to
the exigences of the present cir∣cumstances.
If any quarrel happen
among themselves, they must stand
to his decision; before him they
can only be impleaded by others;
and the partiality they shew to them
is so great, that it is much better
to take an injury patiently, than to
go about to redress it by a com∣plaint,
which oftentimes too is re∣sented
and revenged. Such an opinion
they have of themselves, that
they think they may do any thing,
and for all that go unpunisht.</P>
<P>It is the grand concern of the
Emperor to make a wise choice of
a General over these masterful Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gene∣ral of the <HI>Janizaries.</HI></NOTE>
of whose fidelity he may rest assu∣red,
knowing the great mischief he
may do by his influence and autho∣rity;
and if there be but the least
shadow of suspicion, he will take
<PB N="130" REF="73"/>
care, upon some plausible pretence,
to put him out of his command;
the very least compliance and po∣pularity
among the Souldiers would
draw him within the danger and
guilt of treason; so that he is forced
to be stiff and fierce, and to draw
upon him their ill-will and hatred,
to keep himself in the good graces
of the Emperour, who yet has a
watchful eye over him, and enter∣tains
continual jealousies and fears
of him, though never so much at
the devotion of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> He
has the Government of no Province,
City, or Castle; has no share in the
management of State-affairs; is ac∣counted
inferior not only to the <HI>Vi∣zir
Azem,</HI> but to the other <HI>Bassas</HI>
of the <HI>Port.</HI> If sometime he be
admitted into the <HI>Divan</HI> or Coun∣cil,
he is only to hear, and never
to speak, but when his opinion is
askt. They will not suffer him to
nominate his <HI>Lieutenant-General,</HI>
for fear they should conspire, and
make new alterations in the Govern∣ment;
and justly; for considering
<PB N="131" REF="73"/>
the power and insolent behaviour
of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> it is far from
being improbable, that as they have
rais'd the Empire to that heigth of
honour and greatness by their va∣lour,
so they will one day be the
ruine of it by their mutinies and
seditions.</P>
<P>They are continually in pay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pay.</NOTE> which
is various, according to the quality,
age, and merit of the person, from
three Aspers a day to twenty, which
they receive four times a year quar∣terly.
They are usually reckon'd of late
years about fifty thousand;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their num∣ber.</NOTE> scarce a
third part go into the wars together,
the rest being in Garrisons upon the
confines of <HI>Hungary, Persia,</HI> and
<HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and are drawn out upon
occasion. And great numbers of
them are found at <HI>Cairo, Buda,</HI> and
<HI>Bagdat,</HI> to overaw the <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
who are of a very unsetled and in∣constant
temper, very prone to sedi∣tion,
and desirous of shaking off
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Government, and only
to be restrained by force. Before
they meet at the general place of
<PB N="132" REF="74"/>
Rendezvous, a proportion of money
is distributed among them, to pro∣vide
themselves with necessaries a∣gainst
evil events; but their chiefest
care is to get warm Clothes, to de∣fend
themselves from the violence
of the wind and cold, and to lay in
provision <HI>della bocca,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI>
call it, to pass the time of their ly∣ing
in the field, or before a besieged
place a little better. Each has his
Tin-pot and his Coffee, and a quan∣tity
of Pulse, Rice, Flesh dried in
the Sun, and beaten into powder
for his broth, Onions and Salt in
his little Sack; this is the usual
entertainment of the Camp. Eve∣ry
Fountain supplies them with
drink; for it is a crime punishable
with death, and as rigorously exe∣cuted
at such a time, to bring Wine
among them. They go soberly to
destroy their enemies. They per∣mit
no women to come nigh the
Army. All private quarrels are for∣bid
under pain of death; the least
provocation is severely punish'd.
Their marchings and encampings
<PB N="133" REF="74"/>
are done without noise; silence be∣ing
one great part of their military
discipline. They ever are in a rea∣diness
to charge, and go wherever
they are commanded, being fearless
of danger and of death it self.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spahyes</HI> are another great
support of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spahyes.</NOTE>
Soldiers who are obliged to serve
on Horseback by the tenure of the
Lands (<HI>Timars</HI>) and Estates they
are possest of; these being not only
the reward of their sweat and blood,
but tyes and obligations to further
service in the field upon the first
summons; each bringing so many
Horses with him according to the
value of what he holds, which is
the reason they do not receive an
Asper of pay out of the <HI>Grand
Signiors</HI> Exchequer, and are there∣fore
known by the name of <HI>Timar-Spahyes,</HI>
or <HI>Feudatory,</HI> to distinguish
them from other <HI>Spahyes</HI> who live
in the Cities, and have not obtain'd
a piece of Land; whose daily pay
is very different, proportionably to
the worth and merit of the persons,
<PB N="134" REF="75"/>
as was said before of the <HI>Janiza∣ries;</HI>
some receiving twelve Aspers,
and others an hundred.</P>
<P>Of these they reckon about twen∣ty
three thousand in <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their num∣ber.</NOTE> and
as many or more rather in <HI>Asia;</HI>
for their number is uncertain, and
encreases with their victories; and
sometimes a rich <HI>Timar</HI> is divided
upon the death of the former pos∣sessor
into many parts; besides such
as live about <HI>Buda</HI> on the one side,
and <HI>Etzrum</HI> and <HI>Bagdat</HI> on the o∣ther,
who are not obliged to go out
of their Quarters. We must not
think that when they war against
<HI>Christendom,</HI> they make bare the li∣mits
and frontiers of the Empire to∣wards
<HI>Persia.</HI> These <HI>Spahyes</HI> are no
better than Country Farmers; their
minds are so taken up with the stu∣dy
of good Husbandry, and the
pleasure of enjoying what they have
has so taken off their minds from
the fatigues and hardships of a
Souldiers life, that by money and
presents oftentimes they labour to
get themselves exempted from that
<PB N="135" REF="75"/>
personal service they owe their Em∣peror;
which is one reason (the
success of a Battel depending more
upon discipline than number) they
do not care to bring such vast Ar∣mies
into the field, as in the last
age, when <HI>Suleiman</HI> carried a hun∣dred
thousand Horse with him in the
<HI>Hungarian</HI> war, when he flattered
himself he should become Master of
the Imperial City of <HI>Vienna.</HI> Every
<HI>Spahy</HI> is so loaden with Arms, that
he seems to carry an Armory with
him, having a short strong Bow,
the same questionless which the old
<HI>Parthians</HI> made use of, with his
Quiver of Arrows, Sword, Gun,
Sheild, Lance, at the top of which
hangs a little Banner, which shews
to what order he belongs. For there
are six orders and degrees of them,
distinguishable by the different co∣lours
of their Banners;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders of <HI>Spahyes.</HI></NOTE> Red which
is that of <HI>Spahioglauleri,</HI> Yellow
that of <HI>Selichtari,</HI> Green, White,
White and Green, Red, and White.
Long experience has taught them
the use of these several weapons,
<PB N="136" REF="76"/>
which they manage dextrously
upon occasion; as they do their
Horses, which they can stop upon
a full career at the distance of a
foot. It is a pleasant sight to see
them divert themselves by throw∣ing
darts on Horseback, which they
do with great strength and dexterity,
turning and winding their Horses at
pleasure.</P>
<P>There is another sort of <HI>Feuda∣tories,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zaims.</NOTE>
whom they called <HI>Zaims;</HI>
fewer in number than the <HI>Spahyes,</HI>
obliged to the same services, but
with greater proportions of men,
having considerable Lordships. To
qualifie their Children to inherit,
their great care is to send them to
the Camp, and breed them up Soul∣diers.</P>
<P>In all their warlike expeditions
great numbers of Volunteers offer
themselves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voluntiers.</NOTE> some out of a design
to succeed into the places of the
<HI>Janizaryes</HI> and <HI>Spahyes,</HI> who shall
happen to be knockt on the head,
which they judg worthy of their
adventure; for if it be their fate
<PB N="137" REF="76"/>
to dye in the field, they believe they
shall directly go into Paradise; and
if they survive a Battel, they are
sure to be enrolled in the <HI>Grand
Signiors</HI> pay, which is the only am∣bition
they seem capable of. Others
out of a principle of zeal, for the
propagation of Religion, who usu∣ally
prove the most desperate, and
seldom come off alive; and to make
the act meritorious, maintain them∣selves,
and think the service it self
a sufficient reward.</P>
<P>The Auxiliary Forces are the
<HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Wal∣lachia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Auxilia∣ries.</NOTE>
of whom before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tartars.</NOTE> Next, the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> not so much by virtue of
an old compact, that in case of fai∣leur
of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> line, their Prince
shall succeed, as some pretend, but
out of an interest to gain by the
war, come in to their assistance.
They are more for their prey than
for fight, which they endeavour to
avoid, till necessity and shame put
them upon it. They carry with
them usually a great number of
lead Horses, which are of double
<PB N="138" REF="77"/>
use, either to set their miserable
Captives upon, or in case their pro∣vision
should fail, to serve them for
food; Horseflesh being one of the
<HI>Tartarian</HI> dainties, and which is
sold in the Market an Asper in the
pound more than Beef or Mutton.</P>
<P>Thousands of poor miserable
<HI>Christians</HI> are forced into the wars,
and serve only for Pioners, having
no other Arms than a Mattock and
a Spade; sometimes placed in the
front of the Army to break the fury
of the onset; or else in a Siege, when
they go to storm, thrust forward,
that upon their bodies the <HI>Jani∣zaries</HI>
may pass the more secure∣ly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkish</HI> Souldiers do not care
to go out of their Winter-quarters
till the Spring, when they may find
grass for their Horses; nor will they
keep in the field after <HI>October,</HI> un∣less
bribed with promises of reward,
or forced to it by some urgent ne∣cessity.
Among their Baggage there
are usually great quantities of metal,
to cast great Guns upon occasion;
<PB N="139" REF="77"/>
which they find more convenient
oftentimes, than to carry Artillery
with them, especially in long and
tedious marches, where there is no
conveyance by water.</P>
<P>The many great victories the
<HI>Turks</HI> have gained over the <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their va∣lour and the causes of it.</NOTE>
are too sad and convincing a
proof of their valour, which is
heightned and rendred desperate by
a concurrence of causes added to
the severity of their discipline and
education.</P>
<P>Before they engage, if there be
any opportunity, the <HI>Surat</HI> or Chap∣ter
of the <HI>Sword</HI> is read out of the
<HI>Alcoran;</HI> which contains a warrant
from Heaven to exterminate and
destroy all who set themselves a∣gainst
this <HI>new Law, revealed by
God to Mahomet;</HI> hence their per∣swasion
and their zeal receive new
vigor and force, that they fight in
the defence of <HI>Gods</HI> cause, which
makes them look upon cowardise
and faint-heartedness as a sin. For
who can be so base and unworthy
as not to be ambitious of dying at
<PB N="140" REF="78"/>
such a time, when they are the
Champions of God? The signal be∣ing
given, they run upon their ene∣mies
with the name of <HI>God</HI> in their
mouths, confusedly repeating it se∣veral
times, and invoking him to
assist and maintain his own cause,
which they are fighting for.</P>
<P>The doctrine of <HI>Predestination</HI>
and Fate contributes not a little to
their fury; upon confidence of which
principle they expose themselves to
certain dangers, believing themselves
safe in the midst of them, if <HI>God</HI>
has so decreed it; which they do
not know, whether he has or no,
but by the event; and if so, all
their wariness and endeavours to
escape signifie nothing in the end.</P>
<P>They are convinc'd by a thousand
examples before their eyes, that this
is the readiest way to rise to a com∣mand,
that there is a certain reward
due to valour, and that the <HI>Bassas</HI>
and all the other great Officers owe
all to their Scymitars. Thus solici∣tous
of fame and honour, they va∣lue
not their lives in fighting, know∣ing,
<PB N="141" REF="78"/>
that if they come off, they are
sure to be preferred.</P>
<P>But the most effectual and effica∣tious
machin to skrew up their cou∣rage
to the highest degree and pitch
of desperation is an opinion, which
by the artifices and insinuations of
the Churchmen passes for infallible
among the Souldiers, that whoever
dyes in the wars, is in the account
of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> a Martyr;
his death expiates and atones all his
sins of what nature soever; that ip∣so
facto he merits the joys and plea∣sures
of Paradise, and his Soul shall
not be kept to attend upon the body
in the grave, to undergo the exami∣nation
of the two Angels, which
they are so terribly afraid of. A <HI>Muf∣ti</HI>
being consulted in what order the
followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> shnuld enter
into Paradise, determined it in fa∣vour
of the Souldiers slain in the
wars, that they were to have the
precedence; then the honest plow∣men;
afterward the Lawyers and
Priests; and the rest promiscuously
without any order at all, as they can
<PB N="142" REF="79"/>
pass and get in in the croud. Ani∣mated
with these hopes, they are
almost unwilling to live; no danger
terrifies, death does not mate their
courage; the pleasant and wanton
thoughts they entertain of their
Fools Paradise do so run in their
minds.</P>
<P>They shew the same, if not a
greater, courage in keeping a forti∣fication,
where they have fixt their
Half-Moon Standard; much more
a Town or City, where they have
built a <HI>Mosch,</HI> when besieged by
<HI>Christians;</HI> chusing rather to under∣go
all the hardships of a Siege, or
the most dismal consequences of an
assault, then any way think of a
surrender. This is a mighty piece
of Religion among them, that <HI>Ma∣hometanism</HI>
may loose no ground;
rather than so, they will perish, not
only without complaint and mur∣mur,
but willingly and with joy
too. Such a fatal obstinacy are
they wrought up to by their super∣stition.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="79"/>
The great wasts, which are made
by plague and war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Slaves.</NOTE> are supplied by
the Slaves which are continually
brought into the Empire, and by
the multitude of women allowed by
the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> It is enough
to rend any heart, that gives way
to the least impressions of pity, to
consider the sad condition of poor
<HI>Christian</HI> Captives in <HI>Turkey.</HI> They
are chiefly brought in yearly by the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who make excursions into
<HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> for several days
journeys, and upon their return
sweep and carry all before them;
several Ships laden with them in
the Ports of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> (the
old name of <HI>Euxine</HI> being wholly
lost and forgot) in the months of
<HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> arriving at <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI>
This is the great Mart for
Slaves, where they are sure to meet
with a quick and a good Market,
for no commodity is more vendible
or merchantable. Or else they are
brought along with the <HI>Caravans</HI>
from the farthest parts of the Em∣pire
in <HI>Asia,</HI> out of <HI>Georgia</HI> and
<PB N="144" REF="80"/>
<HI>Mengrelia;</HI> wholly intent upon their
private gain in the sale. The <HI>Tartars</HI>
while they enrich themselves with
this kind of spoil, advance the pub∣lick
interest of the <HI>Turks;</HI> that part
of <HI>Christendom,</HI> which they ravage,
being much weakned by the loss of
thousands, thus barbarously carried
into captivity, and their own Em∣pire
enlarged and strengthened by
such great accessions. For few ever
return to their native Country; and
fewer have the courage and constan∣cy
of retaining the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith,
in which they were educated; their
education being but mean, and their
knowledg but slight in the principles
and grounds of it; whereof some are
frighted into <HI>Turcism</HI> by their im∣patience
and too deep resentments
of the hardships of the servitude;
others are enticed by the blandish∣ments
and flatteries of pleasure the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Law allows, and the al∣lurements
they have of making their
condition better, and more easie by
a change of their Religion: having
no hopes left of being redeemed,
<PB N="145" REF="80"/>
they renounce their <HI>Saviour</HI> and
their <HI>Christianity,</HI> and soon forget
their original Country, and are no
longer lookt upon as strangers, but
pass for natives. Every <HI>Wednesday</HI>
morning they are exposed publick∣ly
to sale, like so many Horses or
Sheep in a Fair, in a peculiar place
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which has the
name of <HI>Jazir Basar,</HI> or the <HI>Slave-Market,</HI>
where is an establisht Offi∣cer
to register the sales. The <HI>Area</HI>
of which is about fifty paces square;
on the sides of it are Chambers,
where usually they put the women.
Here I have seen, not without hor∣ror
and confusion of mind (for pi∣ty
was too mean a passion, and soon
swallowed up with so dismal and
frightful a spectacle) above five
hundred at the same time, as so ma∣ny
victims, ready to be offered to
<HI>Moloch.</HI> The poor Children, scarce
yet sensible of their misfortune, mo∣dest
and silent; and the women, who
had any skill in Embroidery, at
work with their Needle; by which
artifice the Patrons think to put
<PB N="146" REF="81"/>
them off at better rates; feeding
them well before hand, that they
may look plump and fat, and seem
to be in good case, and putting them
on handsom clothes, the better to
attract a Chapman. There is scarce
a <HI>Turk,</HI> if he be of any fashion, but
has one Slave at least, and some of
them twenty, according to the great∣ness
of their estates, and the occa∣sions
they have of them. They are
their proper goods, and let them
out to hire sometime; whatever they
get, is their Masters, who have an
absolute power and command over
them in all things, except in the
case of life and death; otherwise
be their usage never so cruel and
barbarous, the poor wretch has no
remedy left but patience and sub∣mission.
It is interest more than good
nature and humanity which makes
them use them well, and puts them
upon providing clothes, victuals,
and whatever is necessary to sustain
life, that they may yeild them the
better service, and for fear they
should sicken and dye; which would
<PB N="147" REF="81"/>
prove their loss: the care of them
being only the same with that they
bestow upon their Cattel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bassas</HI> and other great men
enjoy themselves unto the height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gran∣dezza of the <HI>Bassas</HI> in what it consists.</NOTE>
out of foresight, that in an Empire,
where all things are so uncertain,
and where happen daily such sudden
changes and traverses of fortune,
they may be soon stript of all; they
will not lose one jot of their gran∣deur,
but mightily pride themselves
in it. In their Houses indeed they
do not consult pomp and beauty,
so much as largeness and conveni∣ence;
their riches is more to be
seen in their Stables than in the fur∣niture
of their Rooms. No Porti∣cos,
no Courts laid out in exact
proportions, no Galleries adorned
with costly pieces of art, nothing
either for state or pleasure; accom∣modation
being chiefly lookt after;
their diet too is course and mean,
and far from luxurious, and little
differing from that which ordinary
persons content themselves with.
Their magnificence appears in the
<PB N="148" REF="82"/>
number of their Women, of their
Servants, and of their Slaves. Being
bred up Souldiers, their care and
glory is to provide for the security
of their Provinces by stores of Arms
and other warlike Provisions; to
get an excellent breed of <HI>Arabian</HI>
Horses, whose race they will run
you up to several scores of years;
and to have a considerable number of
brave, tall, and well proportion'd
young men to mount them, and to
be of their constant retinue. In this
piece of gallantry they strive who
shall out-do the other; which they
think is true greatness.</P>
<P>The law confines them to a set
number of Wives;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Women-Slaves al∣lowed.</NOTE> but for Women-Slaves
they are left to their own
choice and liberty. They may heap
up as many as their lust and their
estate will and can give way to. It
is wholly indifferent of what Reli∣gion
they be, so they be not very
<HI>heathen.</HI> Over them they have a
full power, and can dispose of them
according to their humour and plea∣sure;
and send them to the Market,
<PB N="149" REF="82"/>
when they are weary of them; it
being no unusual thing for a poor
miserable <HI>Christian</HI> woman to be
sold five or six times. I observed a
piece of cunning in the <HI>Jews,</HI> who
are well versed in all the little tricks
and shifts of gain, and who usually
thrive under all Governments, where∣ever
they are tolerated: They buy
little Girls of five or six years of
age at the rate of thirty or forty
Dollars, and are mighty careful in
their education; teaching them to
dance and sing, and instructing them
in all the sorts of a winning beha∣viour;
and the advantage they re∣ceive
does fully answer their labour
and expence; these accomplishments
rendring them valuable at twenty
times more than what they cost;
being oftentimes taken into the <HI>Se∣raglio,</HI>
or into the Families of the
<HI>Bassas,</HI> the ordinary <HI>Turks</HI> having
not wherewithall to make such a
purchase. And these mindful of the
kindness of their Educators, whose
chief design was their own profit,
which has been the happy occasion
<PB N="150" REF="83"/>
of their preferment, do them, by
the interest they get in their respe∣ctive
Patrons, many real and great
kindnesses. For the Captive-women
there is scarce any possibility to e∣scape;
they are forced to keep at
home, and only divert themselves
by looking through a lattice of an
upper Chamber, if they belong to
a person of any condition, who usu∣ally
keeps a <HI>Bagno</HI> in his house;
the meaner sort only going abroad,
it being disgraceful and scandalous to
be seen in publick, except in the Sum∣mer
time when they are permitted
now and then to go into the fields, or
pass the strait to <HI>Scutary,</HI> or enjoy
the cool refreshing air of the <HI>Bos∣phorus</HI>
in a Boat, as I have seen
them sometimes, with a black Eu∣nuch
in their company, not so much
for a guard, as a spy to secure the
fears and suspitions of their jealous
Lord and Master.</P>
<P>Fury and impatience oftentimes
drive the Men-Slaves upon desperate
attempts of escaping,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men-Slaves often make escapes.</NOTE> preferring their
liberty to the great hazard of being
<PB N="151" REF="83"/>
retaken and the ill consequences of
it. Some have lain so long in the
woods, and other places, till they
have been forced by hunger into the
highways, which lead to Towns.
The <HI>Turks</HI> suspect all straglers, and
seize upon them either for their own
use, or upon the first notice given,
to restore them to their Patrons, un∣less
they produce an <HI>Hogiet</HI> or Paper
under the <HI>Cadyes</HI> hand, that they
are free-men. Upon the absence and
flight of a Slave they give notice far
and wide, and order several to watch
at Bridges, which they must necessa∣rily
pass. When I pass'd the
Bridge laid over the <HI>Cayster,</HI> not
far from <HI>Ephesus,</HI> too deep to be
forded, several <HI>Turks</HI> had fixt their
station there, hoping at that pass to
intercept the Slaves they were in
quest and pursuit of, and taking us
to be as good <HI>Musulmans</HI> as them∣selves,
desired us, that if in our travels
we met with any such, whom they
described, we would stop them
and carry them before the next <HI>Ca∣dy.</HI>
But for all this care on the one
<PB N="152" REF="84"/>
side, and hazard on the other, some
are so happy to get away, and are
mightily favoured in it, by the
<HI>Western Christians</HI> especially, in a
Sea-Port Town, when the Ships are
upon their departure for <HI>Christen∣dom.</HI>
There is such a visible appea∣rance
of Providence in the following
stories, that I should not pardon my
self if I omitted them. A poor <HI>Russ</HI>
Lad, about twelve years old, being
evil intreated of his Master, was re∣solved
to try his fortune, and upon
the next opportunity in the evening
stole away. He gets hastily over
the water out of the City, altoge∣ther
ignorant whither he went; a
good providence carried him to a
<HI>Christian</HI> Village about a mile from
<HI>Pera;</HI> he wanders up and down as
a Stranger, not knowing in that sad
perplexity of mind, where he was,
or what he had to do, being equally
afraid to go or stay; it hapned,
that one of our <HI>Druggermen</HI> had at
that time business there, and easily
guessing him to be a poor <HI>Christian</HI>
run away from his Master, the Lad
<PB N="153" REF="84"/>
confest it, and beg'd of him for
<HI>Christ</HI>'s sake to take pity on him.
The good man promised him to take
care of him when it was a little dar∣ker,
when he could do it with grea∣ter
security, and with better hope of
success. About an hour and a half
in the night, he brought the Boy to
our House to kiss my <HI>Lord Am∣bassador</HI>'s
Vest; immediately he was
put into a Livery, and a Perruke
given him, and kept within doors
for some time: but after he began
to talk <HI>English,</HI> he walked the streets
securely; so disguised in his looks
and habit, that if his <HI>Turkish</HI> Ma∣ster
had met him, he would not
have known him, he passing for
one who had come out of <HI>England</HI>
with us. The other is this, A few
days before we set sail for <HI>Italy,</HI>
lying at Anchor in the Bay of <HI>Smyr∣na</HI>
about a League without the Ca∣stle,
about midnight the Seamen,
who were upon the Watch, heard
a mournful voice of one in the wa∣ter,
calling for help; they immedi∣ately
run to the sides of the Ship,
<PB N="154" REF="85"/>
and spy one almost quite spent with
swimming, and ready to sink through
weariness; they throw out a Rope,
and get him aboard. We then lay
fourteen miles from the City, and
about a mile and a half from the
shore. When they had recovered
him with strong-water and a warm
bed, he told us next day, that he
was a poor <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Russia,</HI> of
nineteen or twenty years of age,
who was resolved to make use of
that opportunity of recovering his
liberty; that he got in the evening
out of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and kept along the
shore, till he came to the place over
against which our Ship rode: a calm
Sea and a bright Star-light night fa∣voured
the bold adventure, so that
he had the Ship always in his eye;
but the distance deceived him, pro∣ving
greater than he expected. He
throwing away his upper Vest into
the Sea, that it might be no hinde∣rance
to him in swimming, committed
himself to the goodness of <HI>God</HI> and
the water, and with much a-do got
to us. We put him into <HI>Christian</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="85"/>
habit, like one of the Seamen; but
for his and our greater security, the
<HI>Turkish Customers</HI> being within a
day or two to search the Vessel, lest
they should give us or the Merchants
any trouble, if they found him with
us, our Captain desired the Com∣mander
of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War,
that lay in the Bay, to receive him
till we set sail: within four days,
when we were out of all danger, we
received him again, and brought
him for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The condition of the Slaves is
more or less tolerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Slaves are treated.</NOTE> according to
the temper and humour of their Pa∣trons.
But of all, a Gally-slave leads
the most sad and miserable life:
when they are abroad at Sea, per∣petually
labouring at the Oar, and
chained to their seats; there they
are fixed in all weathers; their on∣ly
hope being this that violent storms
are not very lasting. They must
make a virtue of necessity, and are
forced to be patient. A love of life
and hope one day of being freedmake
them submit their backs to the cruel
<PB N="156" REF="86"/>
whip; otherwise death would be a
real advantage to them: and some
indeed out of a weariness and loath∣ing,
of life have been so desperate
as to get loose and leap into the
Sea.</P>
<P>They who are taken in the wars
are the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> Slaves, and
seldom or never get their liberty,
unless when a <HI>Christian</HI> Ambassa∣dor
intercedes powerfully in their
behalf, or that this condition be in∣serted
in the Articles of a Treaty re∣newed
after a rupture by war; a
point the <HI>Signoria</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> in the
late accord upon the surrendry of
<HI>Candia</HI> pursued with great zeal, and
by the prudent conduct of their
<HI>Bailo</HI> so happily effected, to the
great honour of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> They
judg it an indecorum, that the Ex∣chequer
should be one Asper the
richer for ransoms. No, their Pri∣soners
must linger out their time,
and grow old either in their Gallies or
Prisons, unless they are met with and
over-powered in fight by the Knights
of <HI>Malta,</HI> who are obliged their
<PB N="157" REF="86"/>
by their Order to be in perpetual
enmity with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and are a
great thorn in their side, and so
have their liberty given them by
the Conquerer; or else when their
Gallies are halled ashore into their
<HI>Voltas,</HI> by some unexspected chance
get away.</P>
<P>At such time they are shut up in
a spacious <HI>Area</HI> by the <HI>Arsenal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arsenal <HI>of</HI> Constan∣tinople, <HI>where the</HI> Grand Sig∣niors <HI>Slaves are kept.</HI></NOTE>
on the North-side of the Haven at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> enclosed with very
high walls, and strict guard kept
at the entrance; and for the grea∣ter
security, they shackle them in
couples. Here I had occasion to
go often, to visit and relieve four
or five poor <HI>English</HI> men; some of
which had served Captain <HI>Geor∣gio,</HI>
a famous <HI>Greek</HI> Pyrate, who
was a plague to the <HI>Infidels;</HI> but
at last by a surprize he fell into
their hands, though after a most
brave resistance, himself being kil∣led
in the encounter, to the great
joy of all the inhabitants of the
Sea-coasts, whose often visits were
so terrible to them: his head was
<PB N="158" REF="87"/>
sent as a present to the Emperor,
for which the Messenger was consi∣derably
rewarded, and the service
of the Captain <HI>Bassa,</HI> who with his
whole Fleet of Gallies, assisted by
some Ships of <HI>Tripoly,</HI> set upon his
two Ships in a Port of <HI>Mitylene,</HI>
highly magnified, and Songs made
upon the victory: my business be∣ing
to confirm them by my advice
in their profession of the Faith of
<HI>Christ,</HI> that no hardship might work
upon their troubled minds to make
them turn <HI>Turks,</HI> and to relieve
them as I saw their necessities re∣quired,
with the money that was
put into my hand for such <HI>Chri∣stian</HI>
uses. The <HI>Turks</HI> allow them
only black bread and water, but
for other necessaries of life they
are beholding to their Fellow-<HI>Christians;</HI>
though some of the
more handy and ingenious, by
some kind of work or other do
scrape together a few Aspers to
lay in a little provision against
the time of their going to Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="87"/>
The Christian Commanders and
Officers are imprisoned in the <HI>Seven
Towers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Seven Towers</HI> a Prison for Gentlemen taken in the wars.</NOTE> scituated upon the <HI>Pro∣pontis</HI>
in the South-East corner of
<HI>Constantinople.</HI> These Gentlemen
are the great trophies of their vi∣ctories;
with these, and their per∣petual
servitude they seem satisfied
in the loss of many thousands kil∣led
in the war. They have a daily
allowance of fifteen Aspers made
by the Emperor, and this is esteem∣ed
a mighty piece of bounty, which
they cannot safely reject, though
the Governour usually gets a third
part of it: but being most of no∣ble
Families, they are well main∣tained,
not only by their Relations,
but by the respective Governments
and States under which they ser∣ved;
considerable sums being year∣ly
sent toward their relief, which is
distributed in due proportion ac∣cording
to their quality and cha∣racter:
only I could wish the <HI>Hun∣garian</HI>
and <HI>German</HI> Gentlemen, who
are <HI>Protestants,</HI> had a little more
justice done them in the distribu∣tion,
<PB N="160" REF="88"/>
and did not suffer upon the
account of their Religion. Here I
went three or four times a year to
give them the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> and
found easie admission into the Castle,
as did the <HI>Religious</HI> of the <HI>Roman
Church,</HI> to say Mass to those of
their <HI>Communion,</HI> who were far more
numerous; visits were continually
made them by their friends; they
had the free use of the Castle, so as
they kept within their due limits;
and free liberty of keeping one ano∣ther
company; and thus they deceived
the tediousness of their imprisonment
by mutual kindnesses and civilities
of conversation; the Governour of
the Castle letting out a Garden to
a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> who had been ta∣ken
in <HI>Corso,</HI> which favour he ad∣mitted
his fellow-prisoners to. No∣thing
seemed to be wanting but
their liberty to make their life plea∣sant;
many of them were allowed to
keep their Servants, and lay in what
provision they pleased; the Gover∣nour
being a mild man, and extra∣ordinary
indulgent, besides the usual
<PB N="161" REF="88"/>
custom of <HI>Turks,</HI> who think that the
right of war will justify the most
horrid act of barbarity and brutish∣ness
toward their Prisoners, who are
to look upon it as a great favour
and mercy that their throats are
not cut. But after that a <HI>French
Gentleman</HI> a Knight of <HI>Malta</HI> made
his escape in the latter end of the
year 1670. in the <HI>French</HI>-Men of
War, which brought their new <HI>Am∣bassador;</HI>
the <HI>Turks,</HI> mad at their
remissness, were resolved to revenge
themselves upon the remaining Pris∣oners,
treating them with all imagina∣ble
despight and cruelty, thrusting
them (having first put iron-bolts up∣on
their legs) into loathsome Cellars
and Dungeons, without the least re∣gard
to their quality, and suffering
no Christian to come nigh them:
and indeed the cruelty and insolence
were so great, that without the di∣vine
assistance it had been altogether
insupportable.</P>
<P>The other Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves in private mens hands</NOTE> who are in pri∣vate
mens hands, are redeemable at
a good price; but then there must
<PB N="162" REF="89"/>
be artifice used in the buying of
them. The more forward the <HI>Western
Christians</HI> are to redeem their Coun∣trey-men,
the greater price their co∣vetous
Masters set upon their heads;
a seeming indifference, whether they
are redeemed or no, does very much
beat down the ransome. They have
rowing in their Galleys <HI>Christians</HI>
of almost all <HI>European</HI> Nations;
<HI>English,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
the like. Which must not seem
strange, though we have a league
of commerce and trade with the
<HI>Grand Signor</HI> and <HI>Ambassadors</HI> re∣side
in the <HI>Port,</HI> and the effects
and persons of the Merchants are
secured by virtue of capitulations,
and our Ships pass securely in their
Seas. For these foolish men enticed
with hope of prey and good pay,
deserted the Merchants Ships of
their own Countrey, and served un∣der
the banners of the <HI>Venetians</HI> and
<HI>Malteses,</HI> or else privateering Pyrats:
the trade being usually gainful, either
by intercepting the <HI>Alexandrian
Saikes</HI> in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> or by ma∣king
<PB N="163" REF="89"/>
a descent upon the land: (the
<HI>Turks</HI> till of late awakened by their
losses, not fortifying their Sea-Coasts,
and lying naked to the assaults of
every bold invader) but now and
then they are snapt themselves, and
catch a <HI>Tartar;</HI> which hapned to
Captain <HI>Georgio</HI>'s men, who were all
considerably rich with their plunder;
but greedy of more, lost all, and their
liberty to boot: a continued success
not being to be hoped for in the un∣certainties
of War. I remember, that
when I was at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> I attended
our <HI>Consul</HI> in his visit he made <HI>Kap∣lan
Bassa,</HI> a <HI>Georgian,</HI> the Admiral
of the <HI>Turkish Armata.</HI> He inter∣ceded
with him in behalf of several
<HI>English</HI> Sea-men which were in the
Galleys; his answer was, that he
had a command from the Emperor
to torment such rogues (for he was
out of all patience when he spake
of them) who assisted his enemies;
that they were to thank themselves
for their slavery; that this severity
was justifiable by the rights and laws
of War; and that he ought not to sup∣plicate
<PB N="164" REF="90"/>
for such, who deserved greater
punishment than what they endured.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bassas</HI> and <HI>Beyes</HI> of the se∣veral
Islands, which are scattered up
and down the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> hold
their Places and Governments upon
condition of furnishing out so many
Galleys, according to a fixt propor∣tion,
every Summer-expedition at
their own expence.</P>
<P>If when they are separated from
the Fleet, they master an Enemy,
both ship and men are their own;
but this hapning but seldom, they
are forced to hire or buy Slaves to
man their Galleys. These were the
men we were forced to deal with.
I should here injure my conscience
as well as the reputation of my <HI>Lord
Ambassador</HI> and the worthy Facto∣ries
of <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna,</HI>
if I should conceal with what earn∣estness
and zeal they would lay out
great sums of Money in this most
<HI>Christian</HI> piece of <HI>Charity,</HI> consult∣ing
herein very generously the ho∣nour
of their Religion, and the ho∣nour
of their Countrey, as it became
<PB N="165" REF="90"/>
<HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>English Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Fifty pounds sterling is an ordi∣nary
price for a Slave; and so much
we have given, and sometimes more.
We had a great mind to set at liber∣ty
one honest man above the rest,
and offered a considerable sum of
Money for his ransom; but it was
refused, and would have been, though
we had doubled it. For they could
not, it seems, well spare him, he be∣ing
a Sail-maker by his profession,
whom they continually employed;
and being sensible how useful he was
to them, they used him very kind∣ly;
so that he could complain of
nothing but the bare want of liber∣ty.
Others of these <HI>Beyes</HI> out of
pride and peculiar hatred to the
<HI>Christian</HI> name and of our Nation,
were so obstinate and inflexible, that
they were not to be moved or
wrought upon, by any overtures of
Money, to part with their Slaves;
which distemper we found most ra∣ving
in the <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Rhodus;</HI> whose
example is an instance of the lasting
revenge of <HI>Turks,</HI> which only death
<PB N="166" REF="91"/>
can extinguish. His Father had
been Captain <HI>Bassa,</HI> and having ac∣cording
to the usual custom, visited
the Islands and the coasts of <HI>Greece,</HI>
went with his Fleet into the <HI>Sinus
Euboeensis,</HI> now called the Gulph of
<HI>Volo,</HI> to the N. of <HI>Boeotia</HI> or <HI>Negro∣pont,</HI>
where were two <HI>English</HI> Ships
at anchor, taking in Corn, which was
contraband, for <HI>Christendom;</HI> which
he made sure of, as lawful prize, and
promised himself an easy victory.
The poor Mariners who knew the
danger, and the inconvenience they
were put to for want of Sea-room,
being not able to turn and wind
their Ships, were resolved however
to fight and die, rather than tamely
yield; there was no hope of flight,
or safety, or victory; which made
them the more desperate. He sends
them an insolent summons to deliver
up themselves immediately; other∣wise
he would beat their Ships
about their ears; and threatens
them with present death. This most
dismal accident, instead of abating,
increased their strength, and made
<PB N="167" REF="91"/>
them the more furious. The <HI>Turks</HI>
fight for prey, the <HI>Christians</HI> only
for revenge; and overprest with the
disproportioned number of the <HI>In∣fidels,</HI>
most of them die bravely, some
few unhappily surviving to be the
triumph and sport of their cruelty.
But the <HI>Captain Bassa,</HI> who thought
to gratify his covetous, proud, and
revengeful humour, was killed in the
fight with a Musket; the manner of
whose death the Son so implacably
resented, vowing revenge upon the
whole Nation for the misfortune of
it, though it hapned above forty
years ago; getting as many <HI>English</HI>
as he can, either by money or vio∣lence,
into his hands, and using them
with all imaginable cruelty and de∣spight
to please his Father's angry
Ghost. He had about ten in his Gal∣lies,
whom he would not part
with at any rate, though we often
tried him; and he a man otherwise
very covetous; but his hatred, and
ill will, and revenge, were in him
more prevalent passions.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="92"/>
The Enthusiasm wherewith <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
was so infatuated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine for∣bid to be drank by <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> did not de∣prive
him of the use of his reason
in other matters, relating to the
establishment of his Religion, which
was to be kept up and propagated
by the joynt aids of ignorance and
arms: wisely considering the hor∣rid
effects of intemperance in a
Camp, how inconsistent with the dis∣cipline
of War, in which his follow∣ers
were to be trained, (there being
no likelihood of its prevailing upon
the understanding of any wise or
sober people otherwise) how the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Asiaticks</HI> had given up
themselves to the excessive love of
Wine, which introduced softness and
effeminacy in their manners, took
them off their natural strength and
courage both of body and mind, and
rendred them less able to endure the
hardships that necessarily attend a
warlike life; how the extravagant
mirth they were guilty of in their
cups, made them unlike men, and
ended for the most part in quarrels
and blood; he forbad the use of
<PB N="169" REF="92"/>
Wine wholly, as if there had been a
Devil in every grape, and that he
diffused his evil influence in the
juice. No, those who were to be
Champions of the <HI>Almighty</HI> were
to be grave and sober, and not any
way expos'd to the danger of losing
their reason, or having their souls
defiled with so prophane a liquor.</P>
<P>This he pretends was the com∣mand
of <HI>God,</HI> which might easily
enough prevail upon a blockish and
stupid people, wrought upon by his
wiles and artifices, to deny them∣selves
this satisfaction, (though their
taste could not but be affected with
the pleasantness, and sweetness and
refreshing qualities of Wine,) and
even force their very natures and in∣clinations
to a submission.</P>
<P>I expected to have found them
as abstemious as they have been
fam'd to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But not∣withstand∣ing this prohibiti∣on, the <HI>Turks</HI> gene∣rally de∣bauched with it.</NOTE> and that no such thing
as drunkenness was to be seen a¦mong
them, or but rarely at least;
this being the peculiar vice where∣with
they used to upbraid the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>
and <HI>Jews:</HI> but I quickly
<PB N="170" REF="93"/>
found, that riot and the love of Wine
were too strong for their first belief
and education; and that the incli∣nations
of Sense had beaten down
the commands of Religion; that
generally all, not only the <HI>Renega∣dos</HI>
but natural <HI>Turks,</HI> Citizens and
Souldiers, were excessively given to
it; except the Priests and old men,
and such as had been at <HI>Mecca,</HI>
whose age, and profession, and man∣ner
of life rendred them averse from
doing a thing so indecent and scan∣dalous;
and that a man could not
do a <HI>Turk</HI> a greater civility and
kindness, or more oblige them, than
by giving them Wine. For the sake
of this they would visit the houses
of <HI>Christians,</HI> and not be satisfied
without it. They are for the pure
blood of the grape, and wonder at
our spoiling the Wine by our mix∣tutes
of water, and think they have
not drank enough, till they are able
to drink no more. The late <HI>Vizir</HI>
himself was not free from this vice
of excessive drinking. For being per∣swaded
(much about the time of the
<PB N="171" REF="93"/>
taking of <HI>Candia</HI>) by his Physician a
little to transgress the law of his
Prophet for his health sake, he no
sooner had tasted the sweetness of
Wine, (for till that time he was ut∣terly
ignorant whether it were sweet
or bitter) but he loved it ever after;
and was almost angry with his Pro∣phet,
for forbidding a liquor so
grateful to the palate; as I believe
he was with himself, for living in ig∣norance
so long: it being his con∣stant
practice, upon his return from
that Island, to indulge himself in it
in the afternoon, when he had dis∣patched
the weighty affairs of the
Empire, relying, I suppose, upon the
strength of a Proverb that holds as
true in <HI>Turkey</HI> as in <HI>Christendom,</HI>
That he who is a wise man in the day,
will not be accounted a fool at
night.</P>
<P>This defection was so gross, gene∣ral,
and notorious, that it alarm'd
the <HI>Church-men,</HI> and filled them with
anger and zeal, which broke out in
bitter invectives; they thunder out
of their Pulpits, that their Religion
<PB N="172" REF="94"/>
and Empire were both like to be at
an end speedily, that the violation
portended nothing but ruine and de∣solation;
that the crime grew to
that excess and height, that it seem∣ed
almost to be above expiation. But
the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> no way moved with
their zeal, drink on still. At last a
certain Priest, one <HI>Vani Ephendi,</HI> fa∣mous
for his eloquence, and who had
gained a mighty opinion in the
<HI>Court</HI> for his pretensions to extraor∣dinary
piety, (consisstent, by the pra∣ctice
and law of the Countrey, with a
multitude of women, which he kept)
upon <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s birth-day, took the
liberty in an harangue before the
Emperor, to put him in mind of the
quarrels of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> occa∣sioned
by this devillish liquor, al∣most
in his very sight, and near his
Tent; that this was of evil Omen
to the Government; that the state
of affairs were in an ill condition;
that <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> were highly
angry and offended at the practice of
so much lewdness, which was uni∣versally
tolerated; and that their
<PB N="173" REF="94"/>
holy <HI>Religion</HI> was in great danger
of being lost by such prophanation.
He very tragically and passionately
laments the miscarriage; then en∣treats
and beseeches with mighty
earnestness and zeal the <HI>Emperour,</HI>
to think of a fit remedy, that may
put a stop to this growing evil: and
for fear his perswasions might be in∣effectual,
he tells him he shall never
enter into <HI>Paradise,</HI> and thereatens
him with everlasting punishment in
the other World, unless he removes
this grievous Scandal. The <HI>Grand
Signior</HI> was then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine for∣bid by the Emperor to be drank all the Em∣pire over.</NOTE>
who commands immediately the
Taverns of the poor <HI>Greeks</HI> to be
shut up; and the Casks of Wine,
the occasion of this great disorder,
to be staved in the open streets; and
issues forth his Royal command, that
no more Wine should be drank all
the Empire over. I cannot but re∣member,
with what horrour the
<HI>Greeks</HI> of <HI>Constantinople</HI> received the
news, how amazed and disheartned
and how they lamented and deplo∣red
the misfortune, being ready to act
<PB N="174" REF="95"/>
the Desperadoes: but their trouble
and solicitude are to no purpose, the
<HI>Emperour</HI> commands, and he must
be obeyed. The <HI>Turks</HI> enter the
Cellars of the publick houses, and
spoil all the Vessels they light up∣on,
where the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armeni∣ans</HI>
had not prevented them by
their over hast, for fear they should
be thought to have disliked or dis∣obeyed
the <HI>Edict;</HI> for that was u∣niversal,
and took in <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>
as well as <HI>Turks.</HI> For they for
the future must abstain from Wine
out of respect to the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s
command, as the <HI>Turks</HI> out of re∣spect
to <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> are always guilty of
Extreams; when once they have
determined upon a thing, though
never so rashly and without the due
examination of circumstances, or the
mischiefs that may follow, they pre∣sently
proceed to execution. What∣soever
they do, they do it with so
much impetuosity and fury, that
equity and clemency and civility
are wholly laid aside. To add geater
<PB N="175" REF="95"/>
force and authority to the com∣mand,
and to strike a terror into the
people, a severe penalty is threatned
to be inflicted upon the transgressor:
the fear of which made them forbear
drinking Wine in private, lest their
very breath should betray them.
The <HI>Christians,</HI> who were less care∣ful
herein, suffered the punishment
of their own folly. For I knew se∣veral
of them faulty herein seized
upon in the streets, and condemned
to the Galleys. Our Drugger-men
would never venture to drink a glass
of Wine, whensoever they crossed
the waters and went, as they had
occasion, for the business of my Lord
<HI>Ambassador</HI> and the Nation, to the
<HI>Caimaicam</HI>'s house; for this had
been an affront, and consequently an
aggravation of their fault, for a
<HI>Christian</HI> reeking with Wine to
breath in a <HI>Bassa</HI>'s face.</P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>Christian
Ambassadors</HI> were concerned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con∣cern of the <HI>Christian Ambassa∣dors</HI> for this severe pro∣hibition.</NOTE> lest
they and their Families, if there
were no Vintage the following Au∣tumn,
should be involved under the
<PB N="176" REF="96"/>
same Inconveniencies; for the
<HI>Greeks</HI> out of despair left off culti∣vating
their Vineyards, not think∣ing
the bare Grapes, whereof there
is such plenty, worth the labour and
cost and time; and it was justly to
be feared, lest the Customers in the
Sea-port Towns would prove fro∣ward
and troublesom, and not per∣mit
any Vessels of Wine sent for
Presents out of <HI>Christendom</HI> to be
carried to their Palaces. The <HI>Ca∣dyes</HI>
too were very fierce in the exe∣cution
of this Order; some out of
zeal to Religion, others out of a
principle of obstinacy and ill will to
the <HI>Christians;</HI> others out of co∣vetousness
to get money for a Li∣cence
and Dispensation. This last
made the <HI>Cady</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> so fierce
upon the poor Religious of the se∣veral
Communions of <HI>Christians</HI>
there, so as to forbid them the use
of Wine in the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> pre∣tending
he did but his duty to the
<HI>Emperour,</HI> when it was a lusty Bribe
the Villain aimed at, knowing the
obligations their Religion and their
<PB N="177" REF="96"/>
vows laid upon them of celebrating
a daily Mass, as the event soon
shewed.</P>
<P>During this disorder the Ambas∣sadors<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who re∣monstrate upon it.</NOTE>
send their <HI>Druggermans</HI> (for
so they call the Interpreters they
make use of in transacting their con∣cerns)
to represent to the <HI>Visir</HI> and
other <HI>Bassas</HI> the injustice of con∣cluding
them under the prohibition;
that it would be a prejudice to their
health, to be forced upon the liquors
of the Countrey, to which they had
not been accustomed; and that it
was against the law of Nations that
they should be deprived of the con∣veniences
of humane life; upon
a debate in their <HI>Divan,</HI> the request
seemed just and reasonable, and fit
to be complied with, that they
should have a liberty of making
what quantity of Wine they pleased
for their own uses; for they would
extend the priviledge no further.
The Ambassadors were unsatisfied
with this order, but made further de∣mands,
that all the <HI>Western Chri∣stians,</HI>
who were under their pro∣tection,
<PB N="178" REF="97"/>
dispersed in the several Fa∣ctories
of the Empire, might enjoy
the same favour. The <HI>Bassas</HI> de∣mur
upon it, and pretend this would
enervate the force of the Emperor's
edict; and that such a concession
would have an evil influence upon
the Government, which is preserved
by a punctual submission to his will
and pleasure, which was the highest
reason of a law. All likelyhood of
success seemed to vanish; our <HI>Drug∣german</HI>
however was commanded
to attend, and take all opportunities
of making new proposals in his Ma∣ster's
name: The matter is put off
from day to day, but at last (for it
was four months first) being wearied
with continued demands, they suf∣fered
their obstinacy with great dif∣ficulty
to be overcome.</P>
<P>The drinking of distilled liquors
was equally forbid;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strong wa∣ters equal∣ly forbid.</NOTE> for the <HI>Turks</HI>
seemed more pleased with them than
with Wine, as affecting their sto∣macks
and brain with greater heats
and tittillations. Neither <HI>Turks</HI> nor
<HI>Greeks</HI> are skilful in the arts of
<PB N="179" REF="97"/>
distillations; but do it in so rude
and gross a way, as that it rather
seems a boyling of liquors, than a
separating the pure and spirituous
parts from the gross and saeculent;
which makes a company of Brutes,
who make sense if not the only yet
the leading principle of life so mad
for strong waters sent out of <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI>
distilled with so much art
and cost, out of spices, herbs, and such
like hot materials and ingredients.
They have no moderation and com∣mand
over themselves or appetite,
and think it can never be satisfied,
unless cloyed with excess. And if
any <HI>Turk,</HI> who indulges himself in
the drinking of Wine or strong Wa∣ters,
does not lose his reason, and re∣turns
sober from such a debauch, it
must be wholly imputed to the
strength of his brain, not to his good
will, much less to his virtue.</P>
<P>Besides their Coffee and <HI>Sherbet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Turkish Liquors.</NOTE>
which last is used by the better sort
in the heats of Summer to quench
and allay their thirst, the ordinary
people drink sometimes other li∣quors;
<PB N="180" REF="98"/>
one they call <HI>Bozza,</HI> made
of a kind of Millet; another made
of boyled raisins and honey mixt;
another of water and honey, and
with eggs macerated in them; be∣sides
a syrup made of preserved
grapes.</P>
<P>But which is most peculiar to
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣mon use of <HI>Opium</HI> a∣mong them</NOTE> is the use of crude <HI>Opium,</HI>
which they swallow whole in little
pills without any the least mastica∣tion.
The stomack performing its
vital function in the opening and
dissolving this concreted juice, the
brain feels the violent operation of
it; the spirits are put into a rapid
motion; a vertigo seizes upon the
person; and a kind of <HI>delirium,</HI>
which takes away the free and so∣ber
use of reason; if they walk,
their motion is very unsteady, like
men who are drunk or mad; and
their tongues faltering, and the whole
body disordered. A thousand foolish
ideas of things possess their imagi∣nation;
their fancies are then most
raving, as if all that time they were
as happy as the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> him∣self.
<PB N="181" REF="98"/>
They think this the greatest
pleasure of life, which they can pur∣chase
at the rate of a few aspers;
for to this purpose some vile persons
take it, as they do Wine, being ca∣pable
of no greater pleasure than
what arises from a preternatural
state of the body. Others to streng∣then
them in their lust; others to
deprive them of their understand∣ing,
so as to be less sensible of dan∣ger,
or the impressions of hunger, or
the cold air, and the other severities
of Winter, and especially when at
such times they are obliged to tra∣vel.</P>
<P>This is the constant viaticum or
provision of the Messengers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief provision of the <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> Mes∣sengers.</NOTE> especi∣ally
<HI>Arabians</HI> by Nation, who like
our foot-posts are employed by the
Ambassadors and Merchants from
<HI>Constantinople</HI> to their several Fa∣ctories;
there being no establisht con∣veyance
of Letters all <HI>Turkey</HI> over,
(which is one argument of their bar∣barousness)
their service is very use∣ful
and necessary. They are reduced
to a set company, and have a <HI>Chief</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="99"/>
over them, who dispatches them to
the several parts of the Empire; and
they perform great journeys with
incredible haste, unless when the
ways are rendred unpassable by deep
snow or great rain and inundations
of waters, and are very faithful in
the discharge of their trust. Dozed
and intoxicated with <HI>Opium,</HI> they
go on their way, and have just so
much sense left as to know they are
not out of it; at first they shake off
the drouziness, which the poisonous
medicament brings upon them, by
a continual agitation of the body;
and when they are tired and forced
to rest, they are content with as lit∣tle
sleep as possible, not lying stretcht
out to their full length, but leaning
down with their backs against a wall
or banke, with their knees against
their belly to keep it warm; every
one knows his convenient dose ac∣cording
to his strength and tempera∣ment;
some will receive the quan∣tity
of a little pea, as ordinarily as
they do their daily food, or rather
make that serve for it; stronger sto∣macks
<PB N="183" REF="99"/>
and constitutions require as
much more, which one would won∣der
how they should concoct, but
that we know, to some by a pecu∣liarity
of constitution, which nature
hath given, or use introduced, occa∣sioned
by necessity or wantonness,
poisons have served for aliment.
How small a part of that, which
custom has made so necessary to
their lives, as that they cannot for∣bear
so much as one day, would put
us into our last sleep, and awaken us
in another World! This affected
phrenzy has this event usually, the
spirits being so often fired and put
into a preternatural motion, their
whole force being spent, grow dull
and torpid; their looks pale and
frightful, like men distracted; their
eyes sunk in their heads; a palsy in
their hands, and all the infirmities of
old age seizing upon them in the
time of their manhood: so that they
appear to be as so many walking
ghosts. Which horrid and necessary
effects of it have of late made the
use of it less frequented among the
<PB N="184" REF="100"/>
more considering <HI>Turks,</HI> who are sen∣sible
their excesses and debaucheries
with Wine are less dangerous and
pernicious to their health. I know
not how true the experiment is, but
this is certain, that those who use <HI>O∣pium</HI>
abstain most carefully, for some
time at least, from drinking cold wa∣ter,:
which they say would cause
death incurably, though without any
convulsion or agonies. This is the
only use of <HI>Opium</HI> with them, igno∣rant
of correcting its noxious and
stupifying qualities, and so making
it fit for medicine.</P>
<P>There is so great and universal a
regard had to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s prohibi∣tion
of eating Swines-flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swines∣flesh pro∣hibited.</NOTE> that the
transgressor is counted sacrilegious
and void of all conscience, who dares
defile his soul with it, as they firm∣ly
believe it does; which opinion is
so rooted in their minds, that they
may be sooner brought to renounce
any part of their Religion, than this
particular institution. Those who
will indulge themselves to drinke
Wine, abhor the very thought of
<PB N="185" REF="100"/>
touching, much more of eating the
least bit of Pork. To breed an anti∣pathy
in their children toward it,
they teach them, as soon as they
can speak, to call <HI>Christians</HI> by the
opprobrious name of <HI>Hogs;</HI> which
hatred grows up with their years;
so that they had rather die with hun∣ger,
than meddle with such profane
and cursed diet, in what strait or ne∣cessity
of life soever. The very sight
of a Hog puts some into a fright
and trembling, which soon passes in∣to
fretting and indignation; and
woe to the poor Swine, if the Soul∣diers
come in their way; for they
are sure to come by the worst of it,
if they escape being killed with their
small shot; the steams of the dressed
flesh are hated worse than any pesti∣lential
air; and therefore if any good∣natur'd
<HI>Turk</HI> condescends to be en∣tertain'd
by a <HI>Christian,</HI> great care is
taken that nothing may be served up
of Hogs-flesh, however disguised:
for this would be an affront not on∣ly
to his Person, but Religion, and
would fright him from the table.
<PB N="186" REF="101"/>
Which I remember hapned particu∣larly
at a worthy <HI>English</HI> Merchant's
House at <HI>Galata,</HI> who prevail'd with
a gentile <HI>Turk</HI> to stay and dine with
him. The Cook not knowing there
was such a Guest in the company,
sent up a mess of Pork, which one
of the servants as ignorantly put up∣on
the table. The <HI>Turk</HI> suspecting
what it was, asked the question, the
thing being confessed, (for there was
no possible denying or dissembling it)
he rises from his seat in great haste
as one out of his wits, looks about
for water, and observing a little Ci∣stern
in one corner of the room (as
is usual) washes his hands, mouth,
and nostrils, as if all had been pol∣luted,
and left us immediately in
great disdain, though fully satisfied
it was a mistake, and no way out of
design. The <HI>Greeks</HI> who live in Vil∣lages
apart from <HI>Turks,</HI> breed up
these creatures not so much for their
own use, as to sell them to the <HI>We,
stern Christians,</HI> and to Masters of
Ships for their Sea-provision; a pri∣viledg
which they are forced to buy
<PB N="187" REF="101"/>
with their Money. But to do this
with greater security, the <HI>Drugger∣mans</HI>
are forced to procure a warrant
from the <HI>Caimacam</HI> every year at
the beginning of Winter; and then
the Swineherd must remain in the
fields, in some by-place out of the
road, till the dusk of the evening;
at which time the <HI>Turks,</HI> not used to
stay out late, retire to their houses;
there being as great silence at an
hour and an half in the night as at
midnight. This great care must be
taken to prevent and take off all oc∣casion
of scandal, offence, and tumult,
which would necessarily arise, if they
were brought into <HI>Constantinople</HI> as
it were in triumph by day-light;
and would be sadly misconstrued, as
an evil Omen of the downfal of their
Empire by the <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>They are at present strangers to
luxury and high feeding;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their diet.</NOTE> the
Kitchen-arts have not as yet got
among them; no poignant sauces to
provoke the appetite, besides pop∣per
and garlick to heat their sto∣macks;
no curiosity of diet, little
<PB N="188" REF="102"/>
decency in their entertainments:
They understand not the use of knife
and fork, tearing the flesh asunder
with their fingers; a wooden spoon
being the chief furniture of their
table. There are some dishes pe∣culiar
to the great mens tables,
which an <HI>European</HI> stomack, though
not nice and curious, would reject;
fish and soul, though they have in
abundance, they do not much affect.
They cut the flesh they roast into
little mammocks, and put them up∣on
wooden spits. The common food
of the <HI>Levant</HI> from <HI>Constantinople</HI>
to the walls of <HI>China</HI> and beyond,
is Rice; which they disguise with
several colours with saffron and se∣veral
sorts of seeds and juices which
yields hearty nourishment. The
usual time of dinner is about nine
of the clock in the morning; they
sit close and round a copper vessel,
placed upon a stool a foot and half
high from the ground, which con∣tains
their plates and dishes
either of tin or earth; (for the <HI>Em∣peror</HI>
does not use silver) and eat
<PB N="189" REF="102"/>
their meat in great haste, as if they
strove who should eat most, or have
done first. This Paragraph of their
diet I should altogether have omit∣ted,
as of too poor and mean a con∣sideration,
if it did not conduce
somewhat to the better understand∣ing
their manners and tempers.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are celebrated
with great noise and tumult;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Weddings.</NOTE> the
Bride muffled up and covered with
a red veil is brought home on horse∣back
riding astride, attended by her
relations and friends, and Musick
playing before, and the boys running
up and down and making a confused
noise. This is the first day of their
coming together; the whole business
of the contract and marriage being
managed in their absence by the
friends of each party. But forasmuch
as the <HI>Mahometan</HI> law permits the
man to put away his wife upon every
slight occasion, that they may not
leave their Daughters wholly at the
mercy of their Husbands, whose hu∣mours
are so fickle and inconstant,
but prevent such an accident, at least
<PB N="190" REF="103"/>
to provide better against it, a Writing
is signed before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> whereby
they oblige themselves to make such
daily allowance to their Wives, in
case they are weary of them and
turn them off: which allowance is
exacted as a just debt and always
payable. The paper of contract be∣ing
ratified, the Proxies of both
parties go to the Parish Priest, who
is invited to the Nuptial entertain∣ment,
who there bestows his blessing
on the married couple; and then
begins the mad mirth, which lasts
for three entire days and nights to∣gether.</P>
<P>They are confined to the number
of four Wives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they treat their Women.</NOTE> who have some little
command over the women Slaves,
though otherwise not much better
treated; for their condition is ser∣vile,
being shut up in their houses as
so many prisons, scarce permitted to
go abroad without a keeper; barr'd
from all outward conversation; their
Brothers grown up to be men, de∣nied
access to them, or else but twice
or thrice in a year, and then in the
<PB N="191" REF="103"/>
presence of their jealous Husbands:
forced thus to live an idle and me∣lancholick
kind of life at home, their
chiefest diversion is to bath often, or
to stand at their lattice-window to
observe the passengers; but the good
Housewives, who are almost dead
with this idle and dull kind of
life, deceive the slow hours by
embroidering Handkerchiefs and
Quilts. Their chiefest care is how
to please their Husbands, in whose
favour they place their happiness;
it being in their power to retain
them, or put them away; so that
their observance and love spring
wholly from a principle of fear.
Examples of which severity are fre∣quent;
after the first or second di∣vorce
a reconciliation is allowed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Di∣vorces.</NOTE>
but if their fury and inconstant hu∣mour
carry them on farther, then
they lye under an interdict. It is a
sin, and no less than that of Adulte∣ry,
to reassume them, unless after
anothers embraces; this punishment
of folly is establisht by law, and is
horribly disgraceful; a greater curse
<PB N="192" REF="104"/>
or infamy than which, <HI>Bayazid</HI> the
first thought he could not wish up∣on
himself, when he was challenged
by <HI>Tamerlan</HI> to fight, if he did not
meet him and joyn battel upon a
certain day. The <HI>Jews</HI> practice the
same liberty of divorcing themselves
from their Wives, allowed by <HI>Moses</HI>
for the hardness of their hearts. A
certain <HI>Jew</HI> had bebauched a <HI>Jewess,</HI>
Wife to another of his own Religi∣on;
which being known, the man
was excommunicated, and turned
out of the Synagogue, and the wo∣man
lockt up and deprived of her
liberty. But they were resolved to
keep company together, and by mu∣tual
consent turn <HI>Turks,</HI> to the great
forrow and regret of the Husband,
from whom she was violently forced
away. At last being convinced of
her sin, and her <HI>Jew-Turk-Gallant</HI>
weary of her, she is willing to re∣turn
to her first Husband; but this
was inconsistent, she being an <HI>Apo∣state,</HI>
with the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and
with the law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which
forbids any <HI>Turkish</HI> woman to marry
<PB N="195" REF="104"/>
either <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>Jew.</HI> The man
is mad for his Wife, and to put him∣self
into a condition to receive her,
he turns <HI>Turk,</HI> and marries her, the
other having given her a Bill of Di∣vorce.
After some time they both
go to <HI>Salonichi,</HI> where is the greatest
concourse of <HI>Jews</HI> in the Empire;
next to <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Cair,</HI>
and turn <HI>Jews</HI> again, hoping in such
a multitude to pass undiscovered.</P>
<P>The women may sue for a Di∣vorce
from their Husbands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what ca∣ses the wo∣men may sue for a Divorce.</NOTE> when
they are not maintained according
to the law, and according to con∣tract,
and when they suffer an injury
too great to be endured; which if
they obtain, they only carry away
their Clothes and Dowry, and lose
all future allowances, and take the
Girls with them; but these cases are
rare, and very feldom happen.</P>
<P>They are very kind and assisting
to their sick friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their kindness to sick persons.</NOTE> accounting it a
matter of piety and religion: the
frequency of visits renders them
troublesome, every one bringing
fruits or medicines, which they judg
<PB N="196" REF="105"/>
proper in the case. This care and
kindness continue as long as there
is hope of life; but when that is
past, and the pangs of death seize
upon the person, the Priest or any
other whispers several times in his
ear, and puts him in mind of that
usual form, of the profession of <HI>Ma∣hometism,</HI>
that there is no <HI>God</HI> but
<HI>God,</HI> and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his Pro∣phet.
They are much concerned for
them in their agonies, and express
it by their looks and by their moan;
but when once they are dead, their
mourning and trouble are at an end;
they cease from all complaints, and
scarce a sigh to be hard, looking up∣on
this, as a finding fault with the de∣cree
of <HI>God</HI> Almighty and a resisting
his will. The dead body is perfu∣med
with Frankincense, carefully
washed with clean soap and warm
water, and sowed up in linnen: un∣less
towards the head and feet,
(which are left free, that the person
may stand on his legs, and shew him∣self
in the grave, when he gives an
account of his faith to the <HI>Examin∣ing
<PB N="197" REF="105"/>
Angels</HI>) and not kept long above
ground. They have not the art of
embalming. Their Funerals are so∣lemnized
without Obsequies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fu∣nerals.</NOTE> no
shew, or pomp, or expence in the
least; they do all in the day-time, and
usually in the morning; deriding
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who at such times carry
lighted Tapers and Torches, and the
Priests their Censers, and hire wo∣men
to cut and tear their hair, and
is a necessary part of the solemnity.
The Priest usually goes before the
corps mumbling out somewhat, who
says peculiar prayers for the soul of
the dead person at his grave; nigh
which he stands alone by himself,
the rest about twenty foot distant,
and there reads some short Chapters
of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Then he gravely
admonishes him about the funda∣mentals
of his Religion, that the
<HI>Angel Inquisitor</HI> may not surprize
him, and find him unprepared with
sutable answers; and that he boldly
confess that <HI>God</HI> is the Creator, and
<HI>Mahomet</HI> his Messenger, and that he
used in his prayers to turn his face to∣wards
<PB N="198" REF="106"/>
<HI>Mecca,</HI> and the like; which
ceremony being finish'd, they lay the
body in the ground, and wish the
man a good success in his examina∣tion.
Their care and respect is not
confined to the grave; for they be∣stow
Money to the poor to pray for
their souls, which they believe find
ease and benefit by their suffrages,
and often go themselves to their
graves, out of love and respect to
their memory. Some Emperors and
great men have left lands for these
very purposes, that these religious
offices may never be omitted. Their
women are not permitted to be pre∣sent
at a Funeral; only the last day
of <HI>Ramazan,</HI> as I said before, they
are allowed to go to the publick
burying places. These burying-pla∣ces
are without the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their bu∣rying-pla∣ces.</NOTE> and usually
nigh the high-way; somewhat per∣chance
for pomp and more for use,
to put passengers in mind that they
must dye also, and serve for exam∣ples
to others: Their graves are
somewhat hollow, that they may
the better rise and sit before the
<PB N="199" REF="106"/>
<HI>Angels,</HI> planks being laid athwart to
keep the sand and dust, that cover
them, from falling upon them. At
the extremities are erected two
broken pieces of pillars (which for∣merly
belong'd to <HI>Christian</HI> Chur∣ches)
or great stones, some of which
are between four and five yards
high, as I found by measure in the
burying-place of <HI>Galata.</HI> They a∣void
doing any possible injury to the
dead; their bones lye quiet and un∣disturbed;
they do not dig up a
grave a second time; every one has
his grave apart; no mixture of ashes
or bones, which are as safely pre∣served
as if they were in distinct
urnes and peculiar vaults and repo∣sitories:
The sepulchral monuments
of the great men are made of free∣stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tombes.</NOTE>
well cut and smoothed, in the
fashion of a chest, whose cover is
taken off, with a stone-step running
round and jetting out. Both sides
are adorned with gilt circles, and
one at each end, the intermedial
spaces being filled up with flowers,
very handsomely wrought; for here
<PB N="200" REF="107"/>
as in their cielings they shew their
skill of engraving and painting.
Statuary and drawing a mans face
they do not pretend to in the least;
this being altogether unlawful; which
makes them so brutishly fierce a∣gainst
all humane figures, whether
wrought by the chezil or pencil. In
either of the extremes is placed a
pillar, which rising from a square, ends
in a cone; on the tip of which is plac'd
a turbant, or a cap, such as the women
wear, to distinguish whose the mo∣nument
is. These monuments are
in the open air. The Emperors and
great men lie buried in Cities, in co∣vered
Chappels, which they have pur∣chased
&amp; built for this very purpose.</P>
<P>An Oath is of great force with
them in deciding pecuniary and ca∣pital
causes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Oaths.</NOTE> they lay their hands
upon the <HI>Alcoran</HI> and call <HI>God</HI> to
witness to the truth of what they
shall attest, which they kiss and then
put to their forehead, having first
washed their hands; for no unclean
person must dare to touch it, as they
are warned by the inscription, that
<PB N="201" REF="107"/>
is always on the outside cover of
the book. If any <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>Jew</HI>
are to give in witness upon Oath,
they adjure them to tell the truth
of what they know, making them
also lay their hands upon the holy
<HI>Gospels</HI> or books of <HI>Moses.</HI> An <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Gentleman being cited before a
<HI>Cady</HI> as a witness of a bargain, rea∣dily
appeared, and was very willing
to take his Oath, as he could do
most conscientiously and religiously;
but they wanted a book to swear
him, which put a sudden stop to the
contestation and trial; after much
search among the neighbouring
<HI>Christians,</HI> they brought in an old
<HI>Latin</HI> book, which they took for
the Gospels; He quickly perceiving
what it was, began to refuse, till his
Interpreter, from whom I received
this account, told him, that such a
scrupulosity would spoil the cause,
and make the <HI>Turks</HI> suspect the
truth of his testimony; that it was
brought there instead of the book
of the Gospels, and that it was be∣lieved
by them so to be; and that it
<PB N="202" REF="108"/>
was the same thing in effect, as if
the original hand-writing of the
<HI>Evangelists</HI> were put into his hands;
wrought upon by these arguments,
he took his Oath accordingly.</P>
<P>Some of them will swear horribly
in their private discourse; some∣times
out of design to gain belief,
and sometimes in their passion; and
the forms are very odd, and which
are not worth being recited or
known. But it is the highest un∣kindness
in the world not to believe
them, when they swear one particu∣lar
Oath; for then they are most
serious, and desire to remove all possi∣ble
suspicion of falshood; which is, <HI>by
the truth of the four books the thing
is so or so, or I will do this or that;</HI>
meaning the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Psal∣ter
of <HI>David,</HI> the Gospel of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
and the Alcoran of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> for
they look upon the three first also as
sacred, and reverence their authority.
They acknowledg <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Da∣vid</HI>
and our blessed Saviour <HI>Christ</HI>
to be great Prophets, and do not
speak of them without a preface of
<PB N="203" REF="108"/>
respect and honour; following here∣in
the example of <HI>Mahomet</HI> him∣self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their re∣spect to the name of Christ.</NOTE>
who has left them abundant
witness in his <HI>Alcoran</HI> of the most
holy life and stupendious miracles
of <HI>Christ.</HI> To whose holy name the
better sort shew so great a reverence,
that if any cursed <HI>Jew</HI> go about to
blaspheme it, they will be sure to
revenge the affront: as it hapned
not long since at <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> a maritime
City of <HI>Thrace</HI> upon the <HI>Propontis,</HI>
where a <HI>Jew,</HI> quarrelling with an
<HI>English-man,</HI> broke out into most
scurrilous language against our <HI>Sa∣viour;</HI>
but the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were
present, were so concerned at the
blasphemy, that they carried the
wretch to the Justice, who hearing
of the evidence, without delay com∣manded
him to be severely drubbed
before him, to teach him more re∣spect
and duty to the name of so
holy and great a Prophet.</P>

in the Histories of ancient times:
and their practice and example have
for the most part every year since in
the Autumn been taken up and fol∣lowed.</P>
<P>During my stay at <HI>Smyrna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Occasion of my voyage.</NOTE> where
I arrived about the middle of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI>
1670. from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in
<PB N="207" REF="110"/>
order to get a safe passage for <HI>Chri∣stendom</HI>
in our Fleet of Merchants
Ships, then lading at that Scale, (the
<HI>Corsairs</HI> of <HI>Algiers</HI> infesting the <HI>Me∣diterranean</HI>
with their number and
strength, and making all sailing in a
single Vessel very dangerous) I was
seized with the same curiosity. But
an opportunity did not so easily pre∣sent
it self: the waters were not then
quite down, and the plains in several
places scarce passable: besides, I
wanted company, which is highly
necessary in those Countreys both
for security and convenience; ha∣ving
had sad experience by my tra∣vels
in other parts of <HI>Turkey</HI> of the
difficulties and hazards of such voy∣ages:
and especially in a voyage I
made to <HI>Prusia</HI> in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> in which
I narrowly escaped having my throat
cut upon mount <HI>Olympus</HI> by several
<HI>Janizaries</HI> newly arrived from <HI>Can∣dia,</HI>
and travelling toward <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI>
But our Ships not depart∣ing
till <HI>July</HI> following, the love and
respect I had to Antiquity, and to
the memory of those <HI>Churches,</HI> once
<PB N="208" REF="111"/>
so famous, made me not only forget
but despise danger: and it hapned
very luckily, that three worthy <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Gentlemen, Mr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ru∣dings,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Jolly</HI> (which last with
one and fifty more most sadly perish∣ed
by Shipwrack neer <HI>Mounts Bay</HI>
in <HI>Cornwal</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1671.) not
long after acquainted me that they
had taken up the same resolution,
and would risque it too. The Spring
was now advanced; and we were
to set out with all convenient speed,
before the heats encreased and grew
excessive: and for our better safety,
we hired two stout and honest <HI>Jani∣zaries,</HI>
well known to our Nation;
two <HI>Armenian</HI> Christians, a Cook,
and three Grooms to look to our
Horses; in all twelve of us. Which
number was but necessary; for at
that time of the year, when there is
grass in the fields for their horses,
the roads are infested with Robbers
in strong and numerous parties, well
mounted and armed, who take all
advantages of assaulting passengers,
and kill first, and rob afterwards:
<PB N="209" REF="111"/>
sometimes coming twenty or thirty
days journey out of the mountains
of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and from <HI>Georgia,</HI> to the
furthermost Provinces of the <HI>lesser
Asia</HI> lying toward the <HI>Archipelago</HI>
for this purpose.</P>
<P>I cannot here conceal the extraor∣dinary
civility and courtesie of the
<HI>Cady</HI> of <HI>Smyrna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cady</HI> of <HI>Smyrna</HI>'s extraordi∣nary civi∣lity.</NOTE> then newly promo∣ted
to that Office, who hearing of
our intended voyage, to oblige and
gain the love of our Nation, sent
one of his Servants to advise us to
be well arm'd, and to have a good
Guard with us; for that he was as∣sured
there were murdrous Villains
abroad on the high-ways, and that
several had fallen into their hands.
This advice was seasonable and most
obliging: and accordingly we pro∣vided
against all evil accidents as
well as we could, relying chiefly up∣on
the good providence of <HI>God,</HI> as
our greatest and best security.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the third 1671. we set out
from <HI>Smyrna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of <HI>Smyrna:</HI></NOTE> and went about to
the Northern-side of the Bay, which
runs in a good way to the North-east,
<PB N="210" REF="112"/>
riding for several hours neer
the shore under the rocky moun∣tains
of <HI>Gordilen,</HI> which with the
opposite mountain <HI>Mimas,</HI> there be∣ing
high hills also to the East, makes
the Haven so secure for Ships, which
lye as it were land-lockt. Our way
lay Northward, and somewhat to
the West. For that we might the
better observe the turnings and
windings of our journey, and the
bearings of places, we took a Sea-Compass
with us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Menamen.</NOTE> Leaving <HI>Mena∣men,</HI>

any convenience, we ascended to a

almost ten hours; our way lying
still Northward.</P>
<P>On the <HI>5th.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plain of <HI>Pergamus.</HI></NOTE> having rode through
a wood for half an hour, we got in∣to
the plain of <HI>Pergamus;</HI> a most
delightful and fruitful plain; several
parts of it plowed up, the rest yield∣ing
excellent Pasturage: it extends
it self to a very considerable length
to the South-east; in some places
abovt five miles over. On the North-west
of the plain we left the river
<HI>Cetius,</HI> which hath but a very small
channel, and the <HI>Caicus</HI> to the South∣ward
of it, which we past over at
a miles distance from the City on a

makes those plains to be scarce passa∣ble

<P>From the Castle there runs down
Eastward a good part of the hill a
stone-wall; at the end of which
some ruines of a fortification, that
seems to have been built for the se∣curity
of it that way.</P>
<P>The ancient Stone-buildings, now
the ordinary dwelling houses of the
<HI>Turks,</HI> still continue in several streets;
the City by this means retaining
somewhat of its former glory, amidst
those many and vast ruines that lye
about it, contrary to the fate of other
Churches; most of whose ancient
<PB N="215" REF="114"/>
structures are wholly ruined, and
pitiful <HI>Turkish</HI> houses built of earth
baked in the Sun, and beggerly Cot∣tages
raised upon their foundati∣ons.</P>
<P>We went first to see the ruines of
a Palace, (as it is judged to be) which
lye in a street to the East part of the
City; where we found five Pillars
of polished Marble, of about seven
yards in length, the Chapiters curi∣ously
wrought, in a line equally
distant: and further on, there being
a larger space between, two other
Pillars; all which serve now only
as so many props to support a wall
that is built close to them. They are
confronted on the other side of the
street with other Pillars of the same
make, but whose Chapiters are bro∣ken,
two lying along upon the
ground.</P>
<P>More Eastward toward the plain
lye very famous ruines of a Church
dedicated to St. <HI>John,</HI> built of brick;
about fifty six paces in length, and
in bredth thirty two; the walls of
a very great heigth, two rows of
<PB N="216" REF="115"/>
windows on each side. Several Pil∣lars
fixt within the body of the
Church, but broken of, and wanting
much of their due height: the
<HI>Turks</HI> not willing to be at any pains
to clear the earth where they are
fixt, and the broken pieces serving
their purpose as well; which is to
place them at the extremities of
their graves: abundance of which
we found in their burying-places in
our travels where ever we came. Un∣der
the East end, a large Vault. On
each side of the Church is a round
building, the one exactly agreeing
with the other. The doors very
high; opposite to which is a great
Nicchio or cavity in the wall; a
Vault underneath sustained by a
great Pillar; the foundation streng∣thened
by several arches and pillars;
it is eighteen of my paces in diame∣ter
within; the walls very thick.</P>
<P>In the upper part of the City is
the Rivolet <HI>Selinus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Selinus.</NOTE> whose stream is
very swift, running toward the
South South-east into the <HI>Caicus;</HI>
over which are built several Stone-bridges;
<PB N="217" REF="115"/>
some with two, some with
three arches. By the stream not far
from the great Church, part of a
wall is yet standing of about ninety
paces.</P>
<P>On the other side of <HI>Selinus</HI> is a
very handsome and large Church,
formerly called <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> into
which you ascend by several stone-stairs;
now polluted by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
and made a <HI>Mosch.</HI> We observed a
passage under ground from the Castle
to the <HI>Selinus,</HI> by which they sup∣plyed
themselves with water. Along
the side of a hill from the South-west
are the remainders of an Aque∣duct.</P>
<P>On a hill to the west of the City
we met with several vast ruines with
six great arches over a water, which
seems to have been formerly a com∣mon-shore;
and South of this ano∣ther
range of six arches more, with
two large rooms. The former of
these ruines the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Kiz-serai</HI>
or the <HI>Womens Seraglio;</HI> telling us,
that anciently they were kept there,
accommodating according to their
<PB N="218" REF="116"/>
rude conception of things, who have
not the least knowledg of Antiquity,
the customs of former ages to the
practice of their Emperor at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
and fancying them to
have been the very same.</P>
<P>More Southward is another great
ruined building with arches, situated
pleasantly upon a hill; from whence
we had a good prospect of the Ci∣ty
and the neighbouring Plain; hard
by which is a Theatre, that opens
to the South, the marks of the steps
still remaining. In the declivity of
which almost at the bottom is a
Marble-stone about seven spans in
length and two in bredth, with this
inscription, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. On the oppo∣site
side a Marble statue about two
or three foot in the rubbish, which
we caused to be removed by a poor
<HI>Christian;</HI> this being the only way
to preserve it; the <HI>Turks</HI> being such
profest enemies to all humane figures,
whether painted, or in Mosaick, or
wrought in Brass or Marble, that it
would quickly be defaced and bro∣ken,
if it appeared above ground.
<PB N="219" REF="116"/>
As we walk'd in the streets, we ob∣served
several Vaults almost every∣where.</P>
<P>We went to see several ruines a∣bout
a quarter of a mile out of
Town, to the S. W. which seem to
have been a fortification; under
which are several Vaults that open
one into another, which serve not
only for the foundation of the build∣ing,
but might also very convenient∣ly
be made use of for a granary to
lay their stores in, though now only
a receptacle of cattel.</P>
<P>To the South much about the
same distance are two mounts oppo∣site
one to the other, raised artificial∣ly
to command the passage, and se∣cure
the Avenues that way; in the
mid way lies the road: and the
like toward the East.</P>
<P>The state of the Christians here
is very sad and deplorable, there be∣ing
not above fifteen families of
them: their chief employment is
gardening, by which they make a
shift to get a little money to pay
their <HI>harache,</HI> and satisfy the de∣mands
<PB N="220" REF="117"/>
of their cruel and greedy
oppressors, and maintain a sad misera∣ble
life. They have one Church de∣dicated
to St. <HI>Theodore;</HI> the Bishop
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> under whose jurisdiction
they are, taking care to send a Priest
to officiate among them.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bagno</HI> we found an excel∣lent
jarr of marble, not unlike a
font; about five or six foot from
the pavement, very neer seven yards
in compass, with figures of horse∣men
in <HI>relievo</HI> round about it, but
broken somewhat at top: neer
which is a curious marble-basin a∣bout
two or three foot higher than
it.</P>
<P>In the yard adjoyning we found
this inscription upon a stone-pillar
sunk in the ground.</P>

<P>Having satisfied our selves with
the view of <HI>Pergamus,</HI> on Thursday
the <HI>6th.</HI> about Sun-rise we set for∣ward
in our journey toward <HI>Thya∣tira,</HI>
our way lying almost due East,
repassing the <HI>Cetius</HI> and <HI>Caicus;</HI> which
last we forded at about two miles
distance from the City.</P>
<P>After four hours we came to a
river, whose channel was somewhat
broad and banks very high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyllus.</NOTE> which
we left on our left-hand; perchance
the river <HI>Hyllus.</HI> After seven hours
we arrived at <HI>Soma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Soma.</NOTE> a very large
Town, situated under a high hill, and
from thence passed in three hours to
<PB N="222" REF="118"/>
<HI>Kirk-agach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kirk-agach.</NOTE> or the Town of forty
trees, placed under a hill also; the

so to <HI>Bak-hair,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bak-hair.</NOTE> a Village so called

those words signifying a fair
prospect; where we took up our
lodging after eleven hours travel.</P>
<P>On the <HI>7th.</HI> from <HI>Bakhair</HI> after
four hours we came to a Village cal∣led
<HI>Mader-kuy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mader-kuy.</NOTE> seated on a little hill,
under which runs a little river,
which loseth its waters in the <HI>Her∣mus.</HI>
In the plain before it we saw
several pillars (about forty or fifty)
some fixt in the ground, and others
lying upon the grass, no other ru∣ines
being near. From this Village
to <HI>Thyatira</HI> in one hour.</P>
<P><HI>Thyatira</HI> (called by the <HI>Turks Ak∣hisar</HI>
or the white Castle) a City of
<HI>Lydia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thyatira.</NOTE> is distant from <HI>Pergamus</HI>
about forty eight miles; almost
South-east, situated in a spacious
plain about two miles and an half in
compass. Very few of the ancient
buildings remain here; one we saw,
which seems to have been a market-place,
<PB N="223" REF="118"/>
having six pillars sunk very
low in the ground, about four spans
only left above. We could not find
any ruines of Churches; and en∣quiring
of the <HI>Turks</HI> about it, they
told us there were several great
buildings of stone under ground,
which we were very apt to believe
from what we had observed in other
places, where digging somewhat
deep, they met with strong foun∣dations,
that without all question
have formerly supported great build∣ings;
but the descriptions of the
Ancients and the several inscripti∣ons
that we found there put it out
of doubt, that this is the true <HI>Thya∣tira:</HI>
though the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who are
prodigiously ignorant of their own
Antiquities, take <HI>Tyreh,</HI> a Town
twenty five miles to the South-east
of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> to be the place, being
deceived by the neerness of the sound
the one has with the other; upon
the same weak pretence, as they
have mistaken hitherto <HI>Laotik,</HI> a
Town not far from <HI>Ancyra (Angury</HI>
the <HI>Turks</HI> call it) in <HI>Galatia,</HI> for
<PB N="224" REF="119"/>
<HI>Laodicea;</HI> when we have most
authentick proofs that it is placed
neer to the river <HI>Lycus,</HI> and not far
from <HI>Hierapolis.</HI></P>

<P>This City has a very great con∣venience
of water, which streams in
every street, flowing from a neigh∣bouring
hill to the Eastward of it
about a mile off; there being above
three thousand five hundred pipes,
if the <HI>Turks</HI> may be credited, to con∣veigh
it to every part of it. It is
populous, inhabited most by <HI>Turks,</HI>
who have eight Moschs here, few
<HI>Christians</HI> residing among them;
those <HI>Armenians</HI> we found there be∣ing
strangers, who came thither to
sell shashes, handkerchiefs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
they bring out of <HI>Persia.</HI> They
are maintained chiefly by the trade
of Cotton-wool, which they send to
<HI>Smyrna,</HI> for which commodity <HI>Thya∣tira</HI>
is very considerable.</P>
<P>On the <HI>8th</HI> we left <HI>Thyatira,</HI> and
about a mile from the City in the

<P>As in the City we found several
stones that had the name of <HI>Anto∣ninus</HI>
engraven on them.</P>
<P>Within two hours we past a small
river, which crost the plain from
East to West; and a mile off another
stream, which we supposed might
arise from the same spring, and be
divided from it.</P>
<P>After two hours more we arrived
at a Village called <HI>Selinte-kuy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Selinte-kuy.</NOTE> where
were to be seen several excellent
pieces of polished marble up and
down, and some few ruines, which
assure us sufficiently, though we had
but just time to look into it, that it
is not originally a <HI>Turkish</HI> Village,
but was once inhabited by <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="123"/>
especially considering the situa∣tion
of it within a mile of a river,
I suppose the <HI>Cryon,</HI> or rather the
<HI>Halys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Halys.</NOTE> so fatal to <HI>Croesus</HI> formerly
King of this Province; whose stream
we found very swift, according to
the ancient account given of it, pas∣sing
thence into <HI>Hermus.</HI> About six
or seven miles beyond is the <HI>Lacus
Gygaeus</HI> or <HI>Colous,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacus Gy∣gaeus.</NOTE> of about five miles
in length from East to West, which
we viewed upon the banks of it;
after we had ascended the hill that
leads to <HI>Marmora,</HI> (probably the
<HI>Exusta</HI> of the ancients,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marmora.</NOTE> so famous
formerly for the sepulchre of <HI>Ha∣lyattes</HI>
the Father of <HI>Croesus:</HI> ad∣mirably
well situated, a spacious and
fruitful plain lying under it) still a
very handsome Town with several
Moschs in it, one fairer than the rest,
with a <HI>Tekeh</HI> or Monastery belong∣ing
to it.</P>
<P>Hence we came into the plains of
<HI>Magnesia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The plains of <HI>Magne∣sia.</HI></NOTE> where the famous battel
was sought between <HI>Antiochus</HI> and
<HI>Scipio,</HI> victory after many turns and
traverses, uncertain to which side to

encline, (the dispute being a long
while maintained with equal fierce∣ness,
prudence, and valour) at last
falling to the latter, who hereupon
had conferred upon him by the
Souldiery first, and after by the Se∣nate,
the glorious title of <HI>Asiati∣cus;</HI>
which title he justly merited:
the victory being of so great a con∣sequence,
that several of the <HI>Asian</HI>
Provinces, terrified with this success
of theirs, immediately yielded, and
became an accession to <HI>Rome</HI>'s great∣ness.
Leaving at some distance
mount <HI>Mastusia</HI> and mount <HI>Sipylus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mastusia <HI>and</HI> Sipylus.</NOTE>
upon the rising of which stands <HI>Mag∣nesia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnesia.</NOTE>
a <HI>Bashalick,</HI> though of late
years governed by a <HI>Moselim</HI> or
Deputy, which separates <HI>Ionia</HI> from
<HI>Lydia</HI> to the East, we crost the plain
toward mount <HI>Tmolus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tmolus.</NOTE> called by the
<HI>Turks Boz-Dag</HI> or the icy moun∣tain.</P>
<P>In our way we repast the <HI>Hermus</HI>
over a large stone-bridg, that seems
to have been built of late years, and
after two hours and a half passing
through a Village called <HI>Jarosh-kuy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jarosh-kuy.</NOTE>
<PB N="235" REF="124"/>
that lies about two miles on this
side, we arrived at <HI>Sardes,</HI> having
been eleven hours on horseback:
our way all along from <HI>Thyatira</HI> ly∣ing
almost due South.</P>
<P><HI>Sardes</HI> (retaining somewhat of its
name still,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sardes.</NOTE> though nothing of its
ancient glory, being called by the
<HI>Turks Sart</HI>) is situated at the foot
of the famous mountain <HI>Tmolus</HI> on
the North side of it, having a spaci∣ous
and delightful plain before it,
watered with several streams that
flow from the neighbouring hill to
the South-east, and with the <HI>Pacto∣lus,</HI>
arising from the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pactolus;</NOTE> on the
East, and encreasing with its waters
the stream of <HI>Hermus,</HI> into which it
runs; now a very pitiful and beg∣gerly
Village, the houses few and
mean; but for the accommodation
of travellers, it being the road for
the <HI>Caravans</HI> that come out of <HI>Per∣sia</HI>
to <HI>Smyrna</HI> with silk, there is a
large Chane built in it, as is usual in
most Towns that are neer such pub∣lick
roads, or have any thing of
trade; where we took up our quar∣ters,
<PB N="236" REF="125"/>
the <HI>Turks</HI> refusing to admit us
into their houses and lodg us, hear∣ing
from our <HI>Janizaries,</HI> that we
were <HI>Franks.</HI> The inhabitants are
for the most part Shepherds, who
look to those numerous flocks and
herds which feed in the plains.</P>
<P>To the southward of the Town
at the bottom of a little hill, the
Castle lying eastward of them, are
very considerable ruines still remain∣ing,
which quickly put us in mind
of what <HI>Sardes</HI> was, before earth∣quakes
and war had caused those
horrid desolations there; there being
six pillars standing of about seven
yards in compass; and about ten in
heigth; besides several vast stones,
of which the other pillars that are
thrown down were made, one pla∣ced
upon the other, and so exactly
closed in those that stand, as if they
were one entire piece, now lying by
in a confused heap; the first row of
pillars supporting huge massy stones
that lye upon them.</P>
<P>From hence we went up to the
Castle which lies eastward;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle of <HI>Sardes.</HI></NOTE> the as∣cent
<PB N="237" REF="125"/>
very steep, in some places al∣most
perpendicular; so that we were
forced to take a great compass about
to gain the top of the hill, whereon
it stands; easy enough to be under∣mined,
having no rock to support
it; but what might be as well im∣pregnable
for its strength, as inac∣cessible
for its heigth in former ages,
which knew nothing of the prodi∣gious
effects of the mixture of brim∣stone
and salt-peter; and when they
made use of no other artillery than
cross-bows and slings. The wall still
remain with several arched rooms,
though somewhat narrow.</P>
<P>Hard by the entrance on the left∣hand
there is this inscription.</P>

<P>By which it appears that it was
erected in honour of <HI>Tiberius</HI> the
Emperor, whom <HI>Sardes</HI> ought to ac∣knowledg
as a second Founder; he
having taken care to repair the
breaches caused by an earthquake,
and having given it the form of a
City again, as <HI>Strabo</HI> has record∣ed.</P>
<P>Easterly of the Castle lie the ruins
of a great Church; and North of them
other vast ruins, the walls still remain∣ing
of a very considerable length,
with several divisions &amp; apartments;
all which take up a great compass
of ground: whether it was the chief
Seat of the Governour, or the pub∣lick
Court of Justice, or the place
where the Citizens used to convene
at this distance of time and in so
great a confusion wherein it is in∣volved,
is difficult to conjecture: but
whatever it was when it stood, it
<PB N="239" REF="126"/>
must needs have been very stately
and glorious. We met with other
ruines all along this tract, which
made us quickly conclude, that the
greatest part of the City lay this
way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have a Mosch, which
was formerly a Christian Church;
at the entrance of which are several
curious pillars of polished marble.
Some few Christians there are who
live among them, working in gar∣dens
and doing such like drudgery;
but who have neither Church nor
Priest to assist them and administer
the holy Sacraments to them: into
such a sad and miserable condition
is this once glorious City &amp; Church
of <HI>Sardes,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Lydia,</HI>
now reduced.</P>
<P>On the <HI>10th</HI> we set out from <HI>Sar∣des,</HI>
and in our way past over seve∣ral
streams running down from <HI>Tmo∣lus,</HI>
which enrich the pleasant plains
we rode through.</P>
<P>After six hours we found in a bu∣rial-place
of the <HI>Turks</HI> full of pieces
of pillars and marble-stones (among
<PB N="240" REF="127"/>
several others, but what were scarce
legible, and required more time to
transcribe than we could conveni∣ently
bestow) this that follows.</P>

<P>Three hours after we arrived at
<HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philadelphia</HI> distant from <HI>Sardes</HI>
to the South-east about twenty se∣ven
miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> is situated upon the rising
of mount <HI>Tmolus;</HI> the streets to a
good heigth lying one above ano∣ther,
which gives it a very advan∣tageous
prospect from most parts in∣to
the plain both toward the North
and East.</P>
<P>It is called by the <HI>Turks Alah
shahr</HI> or the <HI>fair City;</HI> which must
be understood only in reference to
the situation; for there is nothing
of building in it to make it deserve
that name. A City formerly of as
great strength as beauty, having had
<PB N="241" REF="127"/>
three strong walls toward the plain;
a great part of the inmost wall yet
standing, though decayed and bro∣ken
down in several places, with se∣veral
bastions upon it. Defended by
them, but more by the valour of the
inhabitants, it maintained its liberty,
and held out against <HI>Vr-chan</HI> and
<HI>Morat</HI> the first, when all the lesser
<HI>Asia</HI> besides had been over-run by
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> forces; but at last in
the reign of <HI>Bayazid</HI> the first, whom
the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Yilderim</HI> or <HI>Lightning,</HI>
after a long distance the <HI>Philadel∣phians</HI>
having made several sallies,
but all in vain, to remove and raise
the siege, it was forced to submit to
the fate of other Cities, and became
a prey to the barbarous Conqueror,
who was not wanting in cruelty to
express his revenge and furious rage
against the distressed Citizens for
daring to withstand so long his victo∣rious
arms: there being about a
mile and a half out of Town to the
South, a thick wall of mens bones
consusedly cemented together with
the stones; in all probability raised
<PB N="242" REF="128"/>
by his command: (for sure none but
such a Barbarian would have done
it) in complyance perchance with
some rash vow that he had made,
when he lay fretting and storming
before it. The Churches felt the
terrible effects of his fury as well as
the inhabitants; most of them be∣ing
demolished and turned into dung∣hills;
as it that of St. <HI>Johns</HI> to the
South-east, most probably the Ca∣thedral
for its largeness, where they
throw their rubbish and filth, and
the rest made Moschs. South∣ward
is the river <HI>Cogamus</HI> flowing
from the hill; abundance of Vine∣yards
all along, which the poor
<HI>Greeks</HI> used to cultivate, but were
at that time deterred from making
Wine, by reason of the severe prohi∣bition
of the <HI>Grand Signor;</HI> so that
here, as a <HI>Greek Pappas</HI> told us,
they had scarce wine enough for the
Sacrament. The City is very popu∣lous,
there being above five hundred
<HI>Janizaries</HI> in it, who according to
their priviledges (the government
being so much in their favour) can
<PB N="243" REF="128"/>
be judged only by their <HI>Serdar</HI> or
Captain; the <HI>Cady</HI> or Civil Gover∣nour
having no power over them in
the least. Next to <HI>Smyrna, Phila∣delphia</HI>
has the greatest number of
<HI>Christians</HI> above the other Metropo∣litical
Seats, there being above two
hundred houses of them there, and
four Churches; whereof the chief
is dedicated to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or to the
holy Virgin St. <HI>Mary,</HI> the other three
to St. <HI>George,</HI> (a great Saint among
them) St. <HI>Theodore,</HI> and St. <HI>Taxiar∣ches.</HI></P>
<P>We found several stones here with
inscriptions, but what were either
turned up-side down and so clapt in∣to
walls, or else horribly defaced
and broken. These six verses found
entire upon a monumental stone in a
Church-yard of the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>

<P>On the <HI>12th,</HI> after three hours
riding from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> we past
over the river <HI>Cogamus,</HI> whose chan∣nel
was narrow, but stream deep and
full; and leaving the plains some
hours after, we climbed up the <HI>Tmo∣lus,</HI>
which we found in some places
very sleep and rocky; on each side
covered with vast numbers of Pine
and Firr-trees: and having gain'd
the top, we entred into a wood very
dangerous to passengers, there being
that shelter for thieves in it, and that
advantage they have, keeping toge∣ther
upon the hills, between which
the road lies, to pour down their
shot upon them, and after three hours
past out of it, and getting on the
other side of the mountain, we came
at last to a Village called <HI>Kosh∣yenigeh-kuy,</HI>
where we lodged that
<PB N="245" REF="129"/>
night, having travelled twelve hours
compleat.</P>
<P>On the <HI>13th,</HI> about a quarter of
a mile hence, we went to see several
ruines, which in all probability, by
their distance from <HI>Hierapolis,</HI> must
be those of <HI>Tripolis;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripolis.</NOTE> of which no∣thing
left but huge massy stones ly∣ing
confusedly in heaps, and the ap∣pearance
of a Castle and Theatre;
neer to which we forded the <HI>Maean∣der,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maeander.</NOTE>
and about four hours after we
came to <HI>Hierapolis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hierapolis</HI> (now called by the
<HI>Turks Pambuck-Kulasi</HI> or the <HI>Cotton
Tower,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierapolis.</NOTE> by reason of the white cliffs
lying thereabouts) a City of the
greater <HI>Phrygia,</HI> lies under a high
hill to the North, having to the
Southward of it a fair and large
plain about five miles over, almost
directly opposite to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> the
river <HI>Lycus</HI> running between,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lycus▪</NOTE> but
neerer the latter; now utterly for∣saken
and desolate, but whose ruines
are so glorious and magnificent, that
they will strike one with horror at the
first view of them, and with admira∣tion
<PB N="246" REF="130"/>
too; such walls, and arches, and
pillars of so vast a heigth, and so curi∣ously
wrought, being still to be found
there, that one may well judge, that
when it stood, it was one of the most
glorious Cities not only of the East,
but of the World. The numerous∣ness
of the Temples there erected
in the times of idolatry with so much
art and cost, might sufficiently con∣firm
the title of the <HI>holy City▪</HI>
which it had at first, derived from
the hot waters flowing from several
springs, to which they ascribed a di∣vine
healing virtue, and which made
the City so famous; and for this
cause <HI>Apollo,</HI> whom both <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans</HI> adored as the God of <HI>Me∣dicine,</HI>
had his Votaries and Altars
here, and was very probably their
chiefest Deity. In the Theatre, which
is of a large compass and heigth
from the top, there being above for∣ty
stone-seats, we found upon a cu∣rious
piece of wrought marble be∣longing
to a portal these words
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
<PB N="247" REF="130"/>
<HI>To</HI> Apollo <HI>the chief President,</HI> a ti∣tle
peculiar to him. Where these
springs arise, is a very large Bath
curiously paved with white marble,
about which formerly stood several
pillars now thrown into it.</P>
<P>Hence the waters make their way
through several channels which they
have formed for themselves; often∣times
overflowing them, and which
cursting the ground thereabouts,
which is a whitish sort of earth,
turns the superficial parts into a To∣phus.
Several Tombs still remain;
some of them almost entire, very
stately and glorious, as if it had been
accounted a kind of sacrilege to in∣jure
the dead; and upon that ac∣count
they had abstained from de∣facing
their monuments; entire stones
of a great length and heigth, some
covered with stones shaped into the
form of a Cube, others ridge-wise.
Some inscriptions we took, which
here follow: the shortness of the
time we staid there, and great dan∣ger
we were in, not permitting us to
take more.</P>

an hour and a half we arrived <HI>Co∣losse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colosse.</NOTE>
by the <HI>Turks</HI> called <HI>Chonos,</HI> is
situated very high upon a hill, the
plains under it very pleasant; but
we were no sooner entred into it,
but we thought fit to leave it; the
inhabitants being a vile sort of peo∣ple;
so that we doubted of our
safety among them. There still re∣main
some poor Christians, notwith∣standing
those horrid abuses they
are forced to endure: but without
any Church or Priest: poor misera∣ble
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who amidst that igno∣rance
and oppression they labour un∣der,
retain the profession of <HI>Chri∣stianity</HI>
still, though they have for∣got
their own language, and speak
only <HI>Turkish.</HI> Hastily quitting the
<PB N="250" REF="132"/>
Town, not long after we met the
<HI>Vaivod</HI> of <HI>Dingilsley,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dingilsley.</NOTE> a very large
and handsome <HI>Turkish</HI> Town about
four miles to the South from <HI>Laodi∣cea,</HI>
with about three hundred horse
in pursuit of a famous robber called
<HI>Inge Morad,</HI> who with a party of
two and twenty horse had alarmed
the whole Countrey. Our way lay
almost West to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> where we
arrived after six hours and a half,
and passing down the hill, lodged at
the bottom of it to the North of
the ruines in a poor Village called
<HI>Congeleh.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Congeleh.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Laodicea</HI> (called by the <HI>Turks
Eski Hisar</HI> or the <HI>old Castle</HI>) a City
of <HI>Lydia</HI> according to the Geogra∣phy
of the ancients,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laodicea.</NOTE> is above twen∣ty
miles distant from <HI>Colosse,</HI> situated
upon six or seven hills, taking up a
vast compass of ground. To the
North and North-east of it runs the
river <HI>Lycus</HI> at about a mile and a
half distance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lycus.</NOTE> but more neerly wa∣tered
by two little rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Asopus, Ca∣per.</NOTE> <HI>Asopus</HI> and
<HI>Caper;</HI> whereof the one is to the
West, the other to the South-east;
<PB N="251" REF="132"/>
both which pass into the <HI>Lycus,</HI> and
that into the <HI>Maeander.</HI> It is now
utterly desolated, and without any
inhabitant; except Wolves, and
Jackals, and Foxes: but the ruines
shew sufficiently what it has been
formerly: the three Theaters and
the <HI>Circus</HI> adding much to the state∣liness
of it, and arguing its greatness.
That whose entrance is to the North∣east
is very large, and might contain
between twenty and thirty thousand
men, having above fifty steps which
are about a yard broad, and a foot
and a quarter in heigth one from
another, the plain at the bot∣tom
being about thirty yards over.
A second that opens to the West;
and a third, a small one, whose en∣trance
is to the South: the <HI>Circus</HI>
was about two and twenty steps,
which remain firm and entire, and is
above three hundred and forty paces
in length from one end to the other,
the entrance to the East. At the
opposite extremity is a Cave that
has a very handsome arch, upon
which we found this inscription.</P>

<P>To the South-east are the ruines

were two rows of pillars from South-east

<P>On the <HI>16th</HI> we left the Village
an hour after Sun-set, the Moon fa∣vouring
us; and after six hours and
a half, at the bottom of a small
hill, but not far distant from a very
high one we saw a boyling Fountain,
whose waters were extraordinary
hot and scalding; it sent forth a ve∣ry
thick vapour like the smoke of
<PB N="254" REF="134"/>
charcoal, which diffused it self over
the plain. About half a mile thence
we crost again the <HI>Maeander</HI> over a
very rotten and dangerous wooden∣bridg,
a fair and large bridg of stone
somewhat above it being so broken
in the midst, that there is no passing
over it, and so entred upon the plea∣sant
and fruitful plains of <HI>Apamea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plains of <HI>Apamea.</HI></NOTE>
watered by the <HI>Maeander,</HI> whose va∣rious
windings and turnings we ob∣served
with great pleasure and satis∣faction:
riding all along its banks
for several hours. After almost se∣venteen
hours riding we arrived at
<HI>Nozli.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nozli.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the <HI>18th,</HI> after we had rode
three hours from <HI>Nozli</HI> we came to
a Village called <HI>Teke-kuy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Teke-kuy.</NOTE> very plea∣santly
situated, and about a quarter
of a mile thence on the right-hand
went to see several great ruines that
lye on the North upon a hill; be∣tween
which and the opposite great
hill is a very lovely plain. We made
up to the ruines of the Castle, and a
great Aqueduct: other vast ruines
lying dispersed up and down for a
<PB N="255" REF="134"/>
great way: these ruines are called
by the <HI>Turks Sultan Hisar</HI> or the
Sultan's Castle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan-Hi∣sar.</NOTE> and can be no other
than those of <HI>Tralles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tralles.</NOTE> formerly the
seat of a Bishop, and a famous City
in the first beginnings of <HI>Christiani∣ty:</HI>
situated about three quarters of
a mile from the <HI>Maeander.</HI> Having
travelled eight hours this day, we
came to <HI>Guzel-Hisar,</HI> where we took
up our lodging in a Chane.</P>
<P><HI>Guzel-hisar</HI> or the <HI>fair Castle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guzel-Hi∣sar.</NOTE> a
very great and well built Town,
walled, and having very handsome
gates, with several Moschs. We found
in it several pillars and ancient build∣ings,
which made us conclude from
its distance from <HI>Tralles,</HI> that it is
<HI>Magnesia ad Maeandrum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Magnesia</HI> upon the <HI>Maeander.</HI></NOTE> formerly
the seat of a Bishop, to distinguish
it from another City of that name
in the same Province, upon mount
<HI>Sipylus.</HI> It is now maintained by
the trade of Cotton yarn, which they
send to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> caravans going week∣ly
hence.</P>
<P>On the <HI>19th,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gherme-aule.</NOTE> from <HI>Guzel-Hisar</HI>
to <HI>Gherme-aule</HI> we made it six
<PB N="256" REF="135"/>
hours; our way lying North-west.</P>
<P>On the <HI>20th,</HI> our way lay hence
West by North, till we came to de∣scend
the hill, upon the top of which
we had seen the Island <HI>Samos</HI> to the
North-west;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island <HI>Sa∣mos.</HI></NOTE> at the bottom is a very
large Aqueduct with three great
arches below, and five above to con∣vey
the water from one side of the
hill to the other, and so to <HI>Ephesus,</HI>
where we arrived after six hours.</P>
<P><HI>Ephesus</HI> called by the <HI>Turks Aya∣saluk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephesus.</NOTE>
formerly the chief Metropo∣lis
of the <HI>Lydian Asia,</HI> and the seat
of the <HI>Roman Proconsul,</HI> (who had
the government of these parts) as
being the principal City subject to
his jurisdiction, was not then so fa∣mous
in its flourishing and glory, as
it is dismal and despicable at present;
being reduced to an inconsiderable
number of poor cottages, wholly in∣habited
by <HI>Turks;</HI> distant from
<HI>Smyrna</HI> to the South-east about forty
six miles. It lies to the South of the
river <HI>Caystrus</HI> in a plain (abounding
with Tamarisk, growing to such an
heigth as to hide a man on horse-back)
<PB N="257" REF="135"/>
under two hills; the one to
the South-east, which runs out but
a little way; the other, which is ve∣ry
high, to the South; under which
lay the most considerable parts of
the City: between which is a plain
of about a quarter of a mile in
bredth: upon the sides of both are
very great ruines, the walls and
some arches remaining: upon the
latter are the ruines of a wall, which
seemed to have bounded the City
that way with several caves upon
the declivity of it. There lye dis∣persed
upon the ground in several
places vast marble pillars; some
white, others speckled; these latter
hard by the Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> of
about seven foot in diameter, and
about forty foot in heigth; their
Chapiters fallen off, and lying neer
them proportionable, of about ele∣ven
or twelve foot square, and about
four or five foot thick, the bases
whereon they were fixed being alike
thick.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="136"/>
The Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> (for so tra∣dition
and fancy will have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diana</HI>'s Temple.</NOTE> though
I suppose it might have been a
<HI>Christian</HI> Church built upon the
ruines of it) is to the West North-west,
where lye stones of a huge
weight heaped one upon another;
it lies North North-east, and South
South-west, the entrance from
the former, as we conjectured by
reason of a very fair gate that way
still remaining, formerly enclosed
with a wall (taking up a good com∣pass
of ground, where they might
have their gardens and other accom∣modations)
though most of it now
broken down. To the West of it,
having lighted our tapers, and made
fast our cord, we went into the la∣byrinth
on the right-hand, where af∣ter
a descent of several foot, we
crept through a narrow passage, and
so past forward in a direct line; on
each side were several rooms, that
open into others, built arch-wise;
the alleys being so low, that we
were forced to creep through them
too; and having continued for
<PB N="259" REF="136"/>
above a quarter of an hour in these
subterranean Vaults built very arti∣ficially,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Laby∣rinth.</NOTE>
and intended only at first as
a foundation of the Temple, (though
not undeservedly called a labyrinth,
by reason of its several turnings, and
the difficulty of finding a passage
out of it without the help of a clew)
being somewhat solicitous of the ill
effects of the damps and the thick
air, which put us into an extraor∣dinary
sweat, we hasted to enjoy the
fresh air and the comfortable light
of the Sun.</P>
<P>To the South-west of the Temple
are the remains of a Watch-Tower
or Castle, placed upon a high rocky
hill, whence there is a very fair pro∣spect
of the South-west Sea, and of
the Promontory <HI>Trogyllium.</HI> Tradi∣tion
will have this to be the place
where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was imprisoned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s prison, or rather a Watch-Tower.</NOTE> out
of reverence to which it is so called;
though the situation, and the nar∣rowness
of it, it being not above ele∣ven
or twelve paces square, encline
me to believe, that it was only in∣tended
for a Watch-Tower to ob∣serve
<PB N="260" REF="137"/>
what ships pass to and again
in those Seas; from which it may
be distant about five miles. Here
we observed to the North-west the
various turnings of the <HI>Cayster,</HI> more
crooked than those of <HI>Maeander,</HI>
watering the plains below.</P>
<P>On the North-east of <HI>Diana</HI>'s
Temple lies upon the ground a very
large Font of porphiry, the in∣most
circle being about six foot
in diameter, which is called by
the name of <HI>St. John</HI>'s <HI>Font,</HI> there
being four pillars not far from it,
upon which they suppose it was
raised. A thing very unlikely, that
in those sad times of persecution
under <HI>Domitian</HI> and <HI>Trajan,</HI> when
the poor <HI>Christians</HI> were forced to
serve <HI>God</HI> in grottas, and Converts
were baptized secretly, there should
be such care taken to do it in so
stately a laver. On the East are the
Aqueducts.</P>
<P>Upon the side of the Eastern hill
is the Cave of the seven Sleepers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cave of the seven Slee∣pers.</NOTE>
neer it several small arches; and
more forward of them a very large
<PB N="261" REF="137"/>
arch, within which are several little
caverns.</P>
<P>On the North is St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church.</NOTE>
turn'd into a Mosch; about seventy
paces in length, and five and twenty
in bredth. In it are four pillars stand∣ing
in a row of excellent porphyry,
of about five foot in diameter, and
much about the bigness of those
that are in <HI>Sultan Suleiman</HI>'s Mosch
in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and about forty
foot in heigth, which support two
Cuppolas, the glass windows still re∣maining;
before it a very large and
fair entrance.</P>
<P>Northward of the Church on the
gate leading up to the new Castle
are very curious figures engraven,
representing several, who seem to be
haled and dragged away, as if per∣chance
the design had been to shew
how the poor Christians were for∣merly
seized upon and treated by
their heathen persecutors.</P>
<P>Here are two very spacious Thea∣ters,
the one under the Southern hill,
the other to the West, neer which is a
stately gate, where I found these words
engraven in two places.</P>

<P>On the <HI>21th,</HI> within a mile of
<HI>Ephesus</HI> we past over the <HI>Cayster,</HI> a
very deep river; and two hours af∣ter
past through a narrow place of
about thirty yards in length, cut ve∣ry
deep through a rock, I suppose,
done out of a capriccio to exercise
the Souldiers, and to shew that no∣thing
is too difficult and impossible
for art and industry to effect. The
marishes that lye below it on each
side of the cause-way, and the low
ground so apt to be overflown, may
make it unpassable that way at some
time of the year; but here, this ly∣ing
upon the ascent of the hill, that
cannot be pretended.</P>
<P>From hence we clambered over
the <HI>Alyman,</HI> which is extraordinary
bad way; part of the famous moun∣tain
<HI>Mimas,</HI> (which runs as far as
<PB N="264" REF="139"/>
Cape <HI>Cornobbero,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> call it
<HI>Kara-borun</HI> or the Cape with the
black nose, at the entrance into
<HI>Smyrna</HI> Bay) which we past over in
two hours. After ten hours we for∣ded
a little river called <HI>Halesus,</HI> that
runs into the Sea at <HI>Colophon;</HI> two
hours beyond which is a <HI>Turkish</HI>
Town called <HI>Giamo-bashee,</HI> situated
in a spacious plain with several hand∣some
Moschs in it; where not meet∣ing
with any accommodation, we
rode half a mile further to a poor
Village called <HI>Karagick-kuy,</HI> where
we lodged, and the next morning
we arrived safe at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> being the
twentieth day from our depar∣ture.</P>
<P><HI>Smyrna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Smyrna.</NOTE> called by the <HI>Turks Es∣mir,</HI>
lyes in the bottom of a Bay,
which is encompassed with high
mountains on all sides except to the
West, about ten leagues in length,
where is good anchoring ground,
and the water deep; so that the
Ships ride neer the Merchants scales,
who for their convenience live to
the water side. The bredth at the
<PB N="265" REF="139"/>
bottom may be, I ghess, about two
or three miles. To the North is
the river <HI>Meles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meles.</NOTE> This is one of
the most flourishing Cities of the
lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> both for its great trade
and the number of its inhabitants;
in which I include <HI>Franks, Jews</HI>
and <HI>Armenians,</HI> as well as <HI>Greeks</HI>
and <HI>Turks.</HI> Little of its ancient
glory is left standing, earthquakes
and fire and war having made as
great desolations and wastes here, as
in the other parts of <HI>Anatolia.</HI> 'Tis
certain from the numerous founda∣tions
continually dug up, that the
greatest part of the buildings anci∣ently
were situated upon the side of
the hill, and more to the South: the
houses below toward the Sea being
built, since <HI>Smyrna</HI> became of late
years a place of trade. On the top
of the hill, which overlooks the Ci∣ty
and Bay, is an old Castle without
any regular fortifications about it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Castle.</NOTE>
and in a manner slighted; there be∣ing
only two or three guns for
fashions sake mounted, with which
they salute the new Moon of <HI>Bai∣ram,</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="140"/>
and the Captain <HI>Bassa,</HI> when
he comes into the Port with his ar∣mata
of <HI>Galleys.</HI> Neer the entrance
is a marble head, the nose of which
is cut off by <HI>Turks</HI> out of their great
zeal and hatred of all kind of hu∣mane
figures especially. I found
nothing in it observable but a Ci∣stern
or perchance Granary under
ground propt by pillars, and the bot∣tom
curiously plaistered over; the
work of the ancient <HI>Greeks:</HI> but
much inferior to one I saw in the
<HI>long Island</HI> just within the Bay on
the side of a hill, into which there
is a descent of about eight or nine
feet; the buildings very regular
and stately, having twenty pillars
in length, and five in bredth, the
distance between each about seven
of my paces, that is above one hun∣dred
and sixty paces one way, and
above thirty five another.</P>
<P>At a little distance from which is
another almost of the same bigness,
but filled with water; the Island be∣ing
altogether uninhabited, but full
of wild hogs and hares.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="140"/>
On the sides of the other gate of
the Castle are yet to be seen two
Eagles, the ensigns of the <HI>Romans,</HI>
delineated at large, and handsomely
enough.</P>
<P>In our descent to the South-east
we entred the Amphitheatre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amphi∣theatre.</NOTE> where
St. <HI>Polycarp</HI> first Bishop of this Ci∣ty
was martyred, the stony steps be∣ing
removed for the most part by
the <HI>Turks</HI> for their buildings and
other uses.</P>
<P>In the sides are still to be seen the
two Caves opposite to each other,
where they used to enclose their Li∣ons;
fighting with beasts being in
ancient times the great diversion of
the people of this Countrey, and to
which they usually condemned their
slaves, and the poor <HI>Christians</HI> espe∣cially.</P>
<P>On the side of the hill, but some∣what
lower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sepul∣chre of St. <HI>Polycarp.</HI></NOTE> is the sepulchre of this
great Saint, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> so∣lemnly
visit upon the anniversary

<PB N="268" REF="141"/>
his martyrdom, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> relates
in the <HI>4th</HI> Book of his <HI>Ecclesiastical

little open room, that possibly might
be some Chappel: in the entrance
of which I found this inscription
upon a marble stone now placed in
a chimney.</P>

<P>The poor <HI>Greeks</HI> are very careful
in repairing this monument, if it any
way suffers, either by the weather,
it being exposed to the air, or by
the <HI>Turks,</HI> or by the <HI>Western Christi∣ans,</HI>
who break off pieces of mar∣ble
and carry them away as reliques;
an earthen dish hanging by, to re∣ceive

<P><PB N="269" REF="141"/>
Nigh hereunto are several arches,
stones of huge bigness lying upon
the ground, and a great building ha∣ving
three large rooms upon a floor;
which perchance was a place of Ju∣dicature:
the front having been for∣merly
adorned with four pillars, the
bases of which at present only re∣main.
Not many years since in a
lane towards the North-east, digging
for a foundation they met with se∣veral
rows of square stones placed
regularly one above another, and in
all probability it might be part of a
Fane or Temple in the times of Hea∣thenism.
In the walls of the City
I observed a great cavity almost in
every square stone, resembling some∣what
a <HI>Roman</HI> V, which some fancy
might be in the honour of the Em∣peror
<HI>Vespasian,</HI> who was a great be∣nefactor
to this City. But the fi∣gure
not being always the same, but
admitting great variety, I am apt to
believe it was rather made by the
Masons, that the stones might be the
better cemented together. About
a mile from the Town are the ruines
<PB N="270" REF="142"/>
of a Church, which the <HI>Franks</HI> call
by the name of <HI>Janus</HI>'s Temple:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Janus</HI>'s Temple.</NOTE>
which I believe rather to have been
dedicated to St. <HI>John</HI> the great Saint
of the East, and that hence the mis∣take
of the name is to be fetch'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have here thirteen
Moschs; the <HI>Jews</HI> several Syna∣gogues;
and yet tho <HI>Smyrna</HI> still re∣tains
the dignity of a Metropolitical
seat; the <HI>Greeks</HI> have but two
Churches, the one dedicated to St.
<HI>George,</HI> the other, if I do not mis∣remember,
to St. <HI>Photinus.</HI> The
<HI>Armenians</HI> have only one Church:
in the Church-yard whereof, I met
with these inscriptions.</P>

For the other inscriptions, I must
refer the learned Reader to the <HI>La∣tin</HI>
copy.</P>
<P>By this short and imperfect sur∣vey
the curious Reader may be sad∣ly
convinced, in what a pitiful and
deplorable condition these once fa∣mous
and glorious Churches of <HI>Asia</HI>
are at this day; Churches, which
had the <HI>Apostles</HI> for their Founders,
and which yielded so many Martyrs,
and which abounded with so many
myriads of <HI>Christians,</HI> whose pati∣ence
and valour tired out and weari∣ed,
and at last triumphed over the
tyranny, the malice, and the hatred
of their <HI>Heathen</HI> persecutors; and
which afterward, when the Empire
became <HI>Christian,</HI> and the civil power
submitted it self to the law and disci∣pline
of <HI>Christ,</HI> and when the Cross,
which before was had in such exe∣cration,
was held the highest orna∣ment
of the Crown, advanced in
splendor and glory above what they
had enjoyed in the times of <HI>Heathe∣nism,</HI>
&amp; which upon a due considera∣tion
of circumstances one might have
<PB N="274" REF="144"/>
truly enough judged should have
been eternal and placed almost out
of all possibility of danger and ru∣ine,
now turned into heaps of rub∣bish;
scarce one stone left upon
another, some of them utterly un∣inhabited,
and the remains of all
horribly frightful and amazing. I
shall not here lament the sad traver∣ses
and vicissitudes of things, and
the usual changes and chances of
mortal life, or upbraid the <HI>Greeks</HI> of
luxury and stupidity, which have
brought these horrid desolations up∣on
their Countrey: these are very
useful but very mean and ordinary
speculations. That which affected
me with the deepest anguish and
most sorrowful resentment when I
was upon the place, and does still,
was and is a reflexion upon the
threat made against <HI>Ephesus</HI> men∣tioned
in the second Chapter of the
<HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> who made
his abode in that City, and died
there. <HI>Remember from whence thou
art fallen, and do the first works:
or else I will come unto thee quick∣ly,
<PB N="275" REF="144"/>
and will remove thy Candlestick
out of its place, except thou repent.</HI>
And upon a farther and more serious
consideration, as I sorrowfully walk∣ed
through the ruines of that City
especially, I concluded most agree∣ably,
not only to my function, but
to the nature of the thing, (and I am
confident no wise or good man who
shall cast his eyes upon these loose
and hasty observations will deny the
conclusion to be just and true) that
the sad and direful calamities which
have involved these <HI>Asian</HI> Churches,
ought to proclaim to the present
flourishing Churches of <HI>Christendom,</HI>
(as much as if an Angel were sent
express from Heaven to denounce
the judgment) what they are to ex∣pect,
and what may be their case
one day, if they follow their evil
example, that <HI>their Candlestick may
be removed</HI> too, <HI>except they repent
and do their first works;</HI> and that
their security lyes not so much in
the strength of their frontiers, and
the greatness of their armies, (for
neither of these could defend the
<PB N="276" REF="145"/>
<HI>Eastern Christians</HI> from the invasion
and fury of the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI>)
as in their mutual agreements, and
in the virtues of a Christian life.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF
DESCRIPTION
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>COnstantinople</HI> seems to have
the advantage of most Cities in
the World for situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The advan∣tage of its situation in general.</NOTE> either in re∣spect
of the pleasantness of its pro∣spect;
or for security against the at∣taques
of an enemy, it being natu∣rally
fortified, and might be made
impregnable by art; or for its nar∣row
passage into <HI>Asia;</HI> as if, in all
changes and revolutions of govern∣ment,
designed by God for the chief
seat of Empire and command. The
high hills, upon which it is seated,
add much to the beauty and glory
<PB N="278" REF="146"/>
of it; several knots of Cypress-trees
appearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set upon them, that
to one sailing in the <HI>Propontis,</HI> it
looks like a City placed in the mid∣dle
of a wood: but in the haven it
resembles a great Amphitheatre, the
houses like so many steps rising or∣derly
one above another; the gilded
spires of the Moschs reflecting the
light with great pleasure to the eye:
so that to all travellers it seems just∣ly
the most delightful, the most ad∣mirable,
and most charming specta∣cle
of nature: and what would even
satisfy for the tediousness and fa∣tigues
of a Sea-voyage, were there
nothing in it to please the fancy or
curiosity besides.</P>
<P>Though it lies upon the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of access.</NOTE> yet
on both sides the passages to it are
so narrow, that there can be no
coming at it without great difficul∣ty.</P>
<P>The entrance to it toward the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> is by the <HI>Hellespont,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hellespont.</NOTE>
which is there about five miles over:
where is a perpetual current into the
<HI>Archipelago,</HI> which is strong and
<PB N="279" REF="146"/>
violent, and especially when the
wind is at North, which blows for
the most part here and at <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI>
eight or nine months of the
twelve: the want of a Southerly
wind, which is necessary to get up
the channel, making the passage ve∣ry
long and tedious. Neer the two
head lands the <HI>Turks</HI> have, since the
beginning of the war: of <HI>Candia,</HI>
built two Castles, to prevent the
landing of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who be∣fore
past unmolested with their ships
and galleys up as high as the <HI>Dar∣danels.</HI>
In the Castle on the level
within Cape <HI>Janizary,</HI> anciently
<HI>Promontorium Sigaeum</HI> on the <HI>Asian</HI>
shore I counted six and twenty great
guns in front; and about sixteen on
the side toward <HI>Tenedos.</HI> A little
above at the end of a long sand is
the river <HI>Scamander.</HI> Sailing di∣rectly
in the middle of the stream,
the guns can do no great execution.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hellespont</HI> widens hence East∣ward,
till almost at an equal distance
between the <HI>Aegaean</HI> and <HI>Propon∣tick</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="147"/>
Seas (for it ends at <HI>Gallipoli</HI>)
you arrive at the narrowest strait,
being scarce three quarters of an
English mile over: where are two
strong Castles to command the pas∣sage;
which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Boghas∣hisar,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dardanelli.</NOTE> or the Castles in the strait or
jaws of the channel, but better known
to the <HI>Christians</HI> by the name of the
<HI>Dardanelli;</HI> directly opposite to
one another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sestos.</NOTE> The Castle of <HI>Sestos</HI>
on <HI>Europe</HI> side, lying under a hill,
is triangular: having twenty five
guns level with the water; and a
Bastion at each angle: in the mid∣dle
an high Tower consisting of
three semicircles, encompassing a
square fortification.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abydus.</NOTE> <HI>Abydus</HI> on the
opposite shore lies in a plain; the
Castle square, having about sixteen
guns, which almost touch the sur∣face
of the water. On the sides are
raised round Towers, and in the
middle an oblong work. The strength
of these Castles is the great security
of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> no ships being
able to get by without manifest dan∣ger
of being sunk: and if at any
<PB N="281" REF="147"/>
time a ship or gally coming from
<HI>Constantinople</HI> have part, helpt for∣ward
by the current and a brisk
Northerly gale, it ought not to be
ascribed so much to good fortune or
a wily stratagem, as to the careles∣ness
and stupidity of the Castellans.
For any but <HI>Turks,</HI> who do not well
understand fortification, and the use
of great guns, to make them bear
to the best advantage, would infal∣libly,
humanely speaking, defend and
secure the passage.</P>
<P>On the other side the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bosphorus.</NOTE>
<HI>Constantinople</HI> is defended by the
<HI>Bosphorus,</HI> whose channel is about
eighteen miles in length. The first
Castles, which guard each side of it,
are about five miles from the City,
built by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the great, from
which about nine miles to the se∣cond,
where the distance between
the two shores is not much above a
mile. The current so violent, espe∣cially
when the wind blows hard at
North, that the water-men, who pass
toward the black Sea, are at such
times forced to go ashore, and hale
<PB N="282" REF="148"/>
their boats. I observed in several pla∣ces
a ripling or bubbling of the wa∣ter,
as in the Race at <HI>Portland.</HI> In
the several turnings and windings
are large Bays for small Vessels,
(made by the Promontories, which
run out so far, that they seem at a
distance to stop the passage) espe∣cially
on the <HI>Thracian</HI> shore, upon
which several Villages are situated,
and where the <HI>Bassa's</HI> and other
great men have their villas and hou∣ses
of pleasure. The <HI>Bithynian</HI>
shore, for the most part covered with
wild Olive, Chesnut, and Cypress-trees,
seems to be one continued
wood or garden, and yields a plea∣sant
and curious entertainment to
the eye, Almost in the entrance or
mouth of the <HI>Bosphorus</HI> are placed
several rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Symplega∣des.</NOTE> the <HI>Symplegades</HI> of
the ancients, which break the force
of the waters continually poured
out of the black Sea. On <HI>Europe</HI>
side I counted four, which lye so close
one to another, that the Sea at some
little distance not being discerned to
run between, they seem to joyn to∣gether.
<PB N="283" REF="148"/>
In the greatest of them re∣mains
still a pillar of white marble
of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> order, about
eighteen foot in height, commonly
called by the <HI>Western Christians,
Pompey</HI>'s pillar, as if it had been
erected by that great man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pompey<HI>'s</HI> pillar.</NOTE> in me∣mory
of a victory gained over <HI>Mi∣thridates</HI>
King of <HI>Pontus.</HI> But this
is the invention of an ignorant and
trifling fancy, taken up without any
ground of reason or old tradition,
(just after the same manner as they
call the ruines, which are neer <HI>Bel∣grade</HI>
a Village about four miles from
the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> by the name of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s
Tower) and is sufficiently confuted
by the inscription upon the basis,
where is plainly legible the name of
<HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> though the remain∣ing
part is so effaced, that conjectures
are different. But the best and truest
I take to be this;</P>

On the neighbouring shore is a
Pharus or Watch-Tower, a very state∣ly
and elegant structure, and built
long before the <HI>Turks</HI> were masters
of a foot of land in <HI>Europe,</HI> now
serving for a light house to direct
Vessels in the nigh to enter the
<HI>Bosphorus</HI> with greater ease and
safety: which I ascended that I
might take the better view of the
<HI>Euxine,</HI> which not so much for want
of good Ports, as for their ignorance
in the Mariners art, becomes in
foul and stormy weather so dange∣rous
and fatal to the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>This situation of <HI>Byzantium</HI> be∣tween
two Seas rendred it a place of
great trade &amp; commerce long before
the times of <HI>Constantine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantage of situation in respect of trade.</NOTE> who restored
it to its ancient glory out of its rub∣bish,
the Emperor <HI>Severus</HI> through
indignation and revenge, for the long
and stout opposition the Citizens
made in favour of <HI>Pescennius Ni∣ger,</HI>
having long before ruined and
demolished it. All the products and
commodities of <HI>Greece, Aegypt</HI> and
<HI>Mauritania</HI> may with great ease and
<PB N="285" REF="149"/>
convenience of shipping be brought
hither. It joyns upon the lesser
<HI>Asia,</HI> where Souldiers and all sorts
of provision may be conveyed in an
hours space. Besides, the various
nations which inhabit all along the
coasts of the <HI>Pontick</HI> Sea, and the
lake of <HI>Maeotis</HI> here find a quick
vent for their merchandise: as do
the several <HI>Christian</HI> Nations, as the
<HI>Cossacks, Moldavians,</HI> and <HI>Walla∣chians,</HI>
and those of <HI>Podolia,</HI> who
live either toward the Sea or nigh
the great rivers of <HI>Boristhenes</HI> or
the <HI>Danube:</HI> beside the <HI>Persian</HI>
and <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants and those
of <HI>Christendom.</HI> So that however
the winds chance to blow, Ships may
come in continually from the one
Sea or the other: they are supplied
especially from the black Sea with
Corn, Furs, Wax, Honey, and the
like.</P>
<P>The present name of <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI>
is <HI>Istanpol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stambol.</NOTE> or according to

<HI>Istamboul a City full of or abound∣ing

little variation accommodating them

for <HI>Adrianople, Prusia, Smyrna,

<P>It lies over against <HI>Scutari,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its particu∣lar site.</NOTE> for∣merly
<HI>Chrysopolis,</HI> about the distance

seems to be built out of the ruines

which is situated in the bottom of a
narrow and shallow Bay. It is now
a poor beggarly Village, having lost
its old name, and known only by
that of <HI>Kadi-kuy:</HI> though out of re∣spect
to what it was in ancient times,
it still retains the dignity of a Me∣tropolitical
seat among the <HI>Greeks;</HI>
the curious and stately Church con∣secrated
to the memory of Saint
<HI>Euphemia</HI> Virgin and Martyr, being
<PB N="287" REF="150"/>
the only remainder of its formor
greatness and magnificence. But to
return to <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>It is cast into a triangular figure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figure of <HI>Constanti∣nople.</HI></NOTE>
the vertex of which is a point of
land to the East, called by the <HI>Greeks</HI>
the Promontory of St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
on which is built the <HI>Seraglio</HI> or
Palace of the Emperor. The greater
side, which lies upon the <HI>Propontis,</HI>
runs N. W. and S. E. about the space
of six miles from the point to the
<HI>seven Towers.</HI> The other side, which
makes the haven, winding like a
horn, called therefore by <HI>Strabo</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, lies East and West; and may
be almost three miles in lenght. The
basis is the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> which unites it
to the Champaign and Continent of
<HI>Thrace,</HI> and lies meridionally from
the Sea to the upper part of the ha∣ven,
almost four miles long, having
three walls running in a strait line,
as far as the ruines of <HI>Costantines</HI>
Palace, (neer which is the greatest
eminence of the City) where is a
turning at a small distance from the
Port, and only a single wall, like the
<PB N="288" REF="151"/>
other two sides, which are washed
with the Sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent.</NOTE> So that the compass
of the whole is between twelve and
thirteen miles; the latitude various,
and at about two miles at the widest,
which is caused by the approach or
distance of the several parts of the
opposite angles. It is advantageously
placed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situated upon seven hills.</NOTE> as I said before, upon the ri∣sing
of several hills; seven of which
are most conspicuous for their great
heigth; most of them have upon
their tops very stately Moschs built
after the model of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI>
whose cuppolas and pyramids seem
almost to reach the clouds. But of
these Moschs I shall have occasion to
speak distinctly.</P>
<P>No place perchance in the World
deceives a mans expectation more
than <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its incon∣veniences.</NOTE> it promising so
largely at a distance both from the
land and Sea: but when you enter
into it, all the glorious outward ap∣pearance
seems but a delusion of
fancy. The streets narrow and un∣equal,
and by reason of their steepi∣ness
in several places, troublesome
<PB N="289" REF="151"/>
to walk in, except one fair street,
which crosseth the City from the <HI>Se∣raglio</HI>
to <HI>Adrianople</HI> gate. And how∣ever
the narrowness of the streets
(though it detracts much from the
sightliness and beauty of a place)
may be excused for the benefit it af∣fords
in sheltering passengers from
the rayes of the Sun, yet the filth
and nastiness is intolerable; dung∣hils
and great wastes of ground,
caused by fire, being every where to
be met with. The ordinary houses
are generally very low and mean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordinary houses.</NOTE>
and without any ornament of build∣ing
or strong materials; only a few
bords clapt together, and the walls
of clay, baked in the Sun. Some few
houses of the <HI>Greeks</HI> remain, which
are built of stone, and high: which
shew what <HI>Constantinople</HI> was be∣fore
the <HI>Turks</HI> cut and broke down
all the carved and stone-work with
their scymitars, and axes, and ham∣mers,
and set fire upon the holy pla∣ces
and Palaces, and pull'd down the
<HI>Cross,</HI> and set up their <HI>half-Moon</HI> in∣stead
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="152"/>
The <HI>Bassas</HI> houses are but little better:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bassas hou∣ses.</NOTE> no portico or pillar at the
entrance; no curious walks adorned
with rows of trees in their gardens;
no pictures or statues; no hangings,
no fret-work in their ceiling; their
outward Courts rude and irregular.
They take up indeed a great com∣pass
of ground: and the portals are
checkered with several colours, as
red, blue, yellow: their rooms are
above stairs, which lead into a gal∣lery
or hall; the chambers little
boxes, the chief furniture of which
lies upon the floor: though some∣times
the roof is gilt, and the sides
covered with tiles, with flowers and
foliage painted, and sometimes,
though very rarely, with cedar∣wainscot:
they being afraid to build
rich and great Palaces; not only be∣cause
it would be lookt upon as an
argument of a foolish and vain pride,
but also of ostentation of their rich∣es,
and what might really prove a
snare, and draw the envy and ill-will
of the Emperor upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="152"/>
The walls are considerably thick
and high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walls.</NOTE> and serve equally for de∣fence
and ornament. Toward the
<HI>Propontick</HI> there runs a ledge of
rocks under water at some distance
from the shore, which keeps off
Ships of greater burthen, and only
admits Galleys and Brigantines
which draw but little water. Part
of this wall, weakned by the vio∣lence
of the waves, or thrown down
by earthquakes, was repaired and
rebuilt by the Emperor <HI>Theophilus,</HI>
this inscription being to be found in
several places:</P>
<P><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><LB/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.<LB/></Q></P>
<P>Under the <HI>Seraglio-point,</HI> upon a
platform, about four or five and twen∣ty
feet broad to the wall, gained from
the Sea, are planted about fifty pieces
of Cannon: one of which they are
very chary of, as being the first
which was discharged at the siege
of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> which they afterwards
so succesfully carried on: to which is
<PB N="292" REF="153"/>
opposite a small Castle not far from
the other shore, which they call by
the name of <HI>Kizkolasi</HI> or the <HI>Virgin
Tower.</HI> These walls are built of free∣stone,
and only here and there pieced
up with brick and uneven stones
clapt in: a few breaches being left,
I suppose, out of design, unrepaired
in the wall to the landward, made
by their guns when they lay before
it. Here in the uppermost wall of
the three are about two hundred
and fifty square Towers with battle∣ments,
built at an equal distance:
to the middle space of which, an∣swer
other Towers in the second
wall, making so many isosceles trian∣gles:
the third a plain wall, now
sunk very much in the ground; the
ditch from the high-way to the skirts
of it being about five and twenty
of my paces. Without are no suburbs,
except two or three farm-houses, and
toward the haven; the Countrey
lying open: which renders the pro∣spect
of <HI>Constantinople</HI> as pleasant
and glorious to the eye upon the
land as upon the Sea:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its prospect from the land.</NOTE> and indeed
<PB N="293" REF="153"/>
the walk from the <HI>seven Towers,</HI>
where I had occasion to go often, to
the haven, all along these walls,
seemed to be the most delightful and
diverting of all that ever I took in
my whole life.</P>
<P>The gates are about five and twen∣ty
in number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gates▪</NOTE> whereof seven are to∣ward
the <HI>Propontis</HI> in this order, be∣ginning

<P>The Emperor's Palace; which the

which latter word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seraglio.</NOTE> which in the
<HI>Persian</HI> language signifies any state∣ly
Mansion, the <HI>Italians,</HI> from whom
<HI>we</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> borrow it form
their <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and appropriate it
hereto) is situated partly upon the
plain, and partly upon the rising of
the hill, which overlooks the Pro∣montory
at the very entrance into
the haven; having the <HI>Thracian
Bosphorus</HI> on the East: upon which
point the current sets so violently,
that Vessels oftentimes upon the
slacking and scantiness of wind are
cast upon it, and get off with very
great difficulty.</P>
<P>Two sides of it, taking in the gar∣dens
belonging to it, are washed by
the Sea: the third to the land, flank∣ed
with Towers, which jet out. Here
in all likelyhood stood old <HI>Byzan∣tium:</HI>

ages of <HI>Christianity</HI> was placed
here-abouts a Colledge of religious
<PB N="297" REF="155"/>
persons belonging to the neighbour∣ing
Church of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI> Se∣veral
years past after the taking of
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> before the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Emperors made it their residence:
<HI>Mahomet</HI> the great abandoning the
<HI>Greek</HI> Emperor's Palace, either be∣cause
demolisht in the time of the
siege, or as ominous to himself and
successors, having fixt his seat almost
in the center of the City: called to
this day <HI>Eski-serai</HI> or the old Palace,
which has but one gate, and the
walls very high: where the women
of the deceased Emperor are con∣veyed
and shut up as close prisoners
without any hope of liberty, except
when they are bestowed as wives
upon the great favourite <HI>Bassas;</HI>
being only permitted at the feast of
<HI>Bairam,</HI> to come and make their
complements to the <HI>Hasaki Sultana</HI>
or the chief woman of the Emperor,
who has been so happy as to bring
him a boy in the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The
whole enclosure comprehending the
gardens and spacious Courts, may
take up about two miles in compass.
<PB N="298" REF="156"/>
The gate to the landward, which is
the usual entrance, (the rest seldom
opened, except upon great occasion)
is always guarded by <HI>Capigies,</HI> the
in-side hung with shields, darts, guns,
and spears; without any great or∣nament,
two pillars of course mar∣ble
propping up the sides. It opens
into a Court, whose area may be
between three and four hundred pa∣ces
in length, but not proportiona∣bly
wide; the whole lying rude.
On the left-hand is a great building,
where the <HI>Agiamgolaus,</HI> who do all
the drudgery and all the vile offices
about the <HI>Seraglio</HI> are quartered:
as also a round building, supposed
to have been a Sacristia of <HI>Sancta
Sophia,</HI> but now turned into an Ar∣mory.
On the right is an Hospital,
where such as fall sick within the
<HI>Seraglio,</HI> are brought for cure. At
the second gate, guarded also by <HI>Ca∣pigies,</HI>
(over which there is the often
mentioned form of the profession of
the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith written in
<HI>Arabick</HI> in large golden letters) the
chief <HI>Vizir</HI> must dismount, only the
<PB N="299" REF="156"/>
Emperor himself riding on horse-back
into the second Court; which
is very stately. The area square, a
portico covered with lead and sus∣tained
by pillars of <HI>Theban</HI> marble,
whose bases and chapiters are bound
with brazen circles, running round
it. The walks curiously laid out
into parterrs on the sides of the pa∣ved
walks, and set with rows of
Plane-trees and Cypresses, and a
fountain in the middle. At the fur∣ther
end on the left-hand is the <HI>Di∣van</HI>
or Council-Chamber;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divan.</NOTE> where the
great <HI>Vizir</HI> and in his absence his
Deputy or <HI>Caimacam,</HI> assisted by the
<HI>Cadileskires</HI> and other men of the
law, administers justice four times
every week, that is, Saturday, Sun∣day,
Monday, and Tuesday; from
whose sentence there lies no reme∣dy
of appeal. At the upper end
is a casement, which opens into it,
where the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> often comes,
(though he cannot be seen there) out
of curiosity or design, to hear the
determination of cases brought be∣fore
them.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="157"/>
This Court of Judicature is not
thronged with idle spectators, here
is no place for such curiosity; only
business or a particular citation
draws company hither; much less
is it permitted to strangers to be pre∣sent
at such times. <HI>Mahomet Ku∣priuli</HI>
Father to the late <HI>Vizir Ach∣met,</HI>
who took <HI>Candia,</HI> one day espy∣ing
several <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen pre∣sent,
demanded their business: they
presuming upon the innocence of
their curiosity, answered, they only
came to see: which put him into a
fit of passion, <HI>What,</HI> said he, <HI>do you
take us for monkeys, which shew
tricks, that you come here to gaze
and stare upon us?</HI> whereupon they
were rudely thrust out, and upon
their alledging they were strangers,
and knew not the customs of the
Countrey, with very great difficulty
they escaped drubbing. To prevent
the like affront or danger, I made a
pretence of debt upon a <HI>Jew</HI> in
<HI>Smyrna,</HI> and attended by our chief
Interpreter, by whose contrivance
the little plot was laid, went boldly
<PB N="301" REF="157"/>
into the <HI>Seraglio</HI> to demand justice;
my request was very plausible; and
upon the proposal of it, they granted
me a warrant to arrest my <HI>Jew</HI> in
case the debt was not speedily satis∣fied,
the fees not coming to above
one hundred or six-score aspers. The
inmost part of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> beyond
the third gate, and the womens
apartment, is kept secret, and to
Christians inaccessible, except upon
extraordinary occasions. The whole,
(though not built according to the
rules of modern Architecture, not to
be compared with the Palaces of
<HI>Christian</HI> Princes) as to the outward
appearance seems handsome and
stately.</P>
<P>For the better accommodation of
Merchants and travellers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caravan∣serais.</NOTE> (there be∣ing
no such thing as an Inn in our
acception of the word in <HI>Turkey)
Chanes</HI> or publick lodgings are ere∣cted
in the chief streets of the City:
from the free use of which no one of
what Countrey or Religion soever is
exempted or debarred, called for
distinction either by the names of
<PB N="302" REF="158"/>
their several Founders, or from the
peculiar sort of Merchandise, to
which they are appropriated, as the
Silk Chane, or the Rice Chane, and
the like. The two best and state∣liest
I saw are those of the present
Emperor's Mother neer her Mosch
toward the haven, and of <HI>Kupriuli</HI>
in <HI>Taouk-bazar</HI> or the Hen-market.
But the figure and the use are the
same in all. They are built for the
most part of squared stone, in the
middle of the area is a little Mosch.
A stone-gallery above the stairs run∣ning
round, and little narrow cham∣bers
opening into it; and the like
below in Chanes of a late founda∣tion:
for in those which are ancient,
there is no division into stories or
partition into rooms; but all lies
open like a great barn under the
same roof: a little wall about a foot
and a half high, and four or five
feet broad, being raised round with
chimneys at three or four yards di∣stance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bezesten</HI> or Exchange is a
square stone-building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bezesten.</NOTE> where they sell
<PB N="303" REF="158"/>
linnen, cloth of <HI>London,</HI> as they
call our woollen manufacturies, Furs,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> but this must not be compared
with that at <HI>Prusia</HI> either for great∣ness
or ornament.</P>
<P>The publick <HI>Bagnos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagnos.</NOTE> which are
for the uses of strangers, and such
as cannot furnish out so great an ex∣pence,
as to have them in their hou∣ses,
(there being a continual necessity
of bathing, not only upon the account
of religion, but also of health in
those hot Countreys) are built of a
courser sort of marble with a large
cuppola. In the outward room there
is a fountain, round which a seat of
brick covered with mats, where they
undress themselves: out of which
you go through a narrow passage in∣to
a spacious room comprehended
under the cuppola, little oblong
squares setting out in the sides. Up∣on
the first entrance, except care be
taken before-hand to reduce the bo∣dy
to such a temper, so as to endure
the heat, one shall scarce be able to
fetch breath, unless with great dif∣ficulty,
and be almost stifled with the
<PB N="304" REF="159"/>
hot exhalations, which are so gross,
that oftentimes finding no vent and
reverberated by the roof, they are
condensed, and fall down in thick
drops of water.</P>
<P><HI>Constantinople</HI> owes the chiefest
part of its present glory to the great
<HI>Moschs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Moschs.</NOTE> which were either formerly
<HI>Christian</HI> Churches, or else built and
endowed by several Emperors and
other great men. Of these and their
Founders, who have adorned the
profession of their Religion with such
pomp and magnificence, the <HI>Turks,</HI>
after the manner of their eloquence,
which consists in foolish and in∣discreet
hyperboles, use swelling
words of vanity. By the vast∣ness
of the structures they judg
of their zeal and piety; and the
greatness of the revenue is an argu∣ment
and proof of their successes
and victories: custom by the be∣witchery
of the <HI>Mufti</HI> and the other
Church-men prevailing, that no Em∣peror
can assume the honour of
building a <HI>Mosch,</HI> except he has
gained so much ground in <HI>Christen∣dom,</HI>
<PB N="305" REF="159"/>
with the revenue of which he
may maintain the publick service of
religion in it, in part at least, as if it
were offering up a proportion of the
spoil to <HI>God</HI> by way of acknowledg∣ment
and gratitude. Which con∣sideration
must needs have a mighty
influence upon them to carry on their
wars with all imaginable vigour, not
only out of a desire of fame to imi∣tate
and equal the glory of their pre∣decessors,
but out of a principle of
zeal and conscience. They make
a fine shew, especially toward the
haven, and are seen at a great di∣stance;
situated for the most part
on the hills; and though not all in
a strait line, yet the heigth takes off
so much from the obliqueness of the
angle, that the eye is at no trouble
or loss to find them out.</P>

<P><PB N="307" REF="160"/>
<HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> appears still a most
glorious structure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sancta So∣phia.</NOTE> though the <HI>Turks</HI>
are not so careful about the beauty
and ornament and reparations of it,
as of the other <HI>Moschs.</HI> The con∣trivance
and architecture are very
admirable, fully answering the de∣scription
given of it by <HI>Procopius
Caesariensis,</HI> who was contemporary
with the most glorious Emperor <HI>Ju∣stinian</HI>
the Founder, and one of the
officers of his Court. A stately por∣tico
at the entrance from the ascent;
five gates covered with plates of
<HI>Corinthian</HI> brass lead into the nave
of the Church. Its length about
one hundred and twenty of my pa∣ces,
and almost half as wide. The
whole fabrick resting upon arches is
upheld by three rows of pillars of
different marble, Serpentine, Porphy∣ry,
and a kind of Alabaster, whose
bases and capitels are bound about
with brass wreaths. In the middle
there arises a large cuppola, suppor∣ted
by four massy pillars, and encom∣passed
without with many little cup∣polas,
some higher than the rest:
<PB N="308" REF="161"/>
several little Chappels of an oblong
figure toward the sides. There is
an ascent by a winding pair of stairs
into the galleries, which take up
three sides of the Church, supported
by several curious marble pillars.
The pavement both of the Church
and gallery is marble, not made up
of little squares, but of very large
tables: the walls crusted over and
slagged with the same. The roof
of the Church and portico in mo∣saick;
though the <HI>Turks</HI> have de∣faced
the faces of several figures;
yet notwithstanding several repre∣sentations
of sacred history may be
clearly enough discerned.</P>
<P>The two next best Moschs are <HI>Su∣leimans</HI>
and <HI>Achmets.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suleimania.</NOTE> In the mid∣dle
of the Court, which encompasses
the former, is a large square foun∣tain
covered at top. The portico
adorned with very curious tall pil∣lars;
the pavement laid with large
tables of porphyry: the cuppola
propt up by four pillars of the same
sort of marble, whose circumference
may be about twenty foot, the spoils
<PB N="309" REF="161"/>
of a <HI>Christian</HI> Church: for such art
and curiosity are above the reach
and skill of <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Into <HI>Achmets</HI> Mosch there is an
ascent of twelve stone-steps,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Achmets</HI> Mosch.</NOTE> the gate
of brass curiously wrought: the
four arches of the cuppola upheld
by four pillars of cast marble, as I
judg it to be, of a very vast bulk.
It still retains the name of the <HI>new
Mosch,</HI> though divers have been built
since, and a stately one very lately
neer the garden gate toward the ha∣ven
by the Mother of the present
Emperor, a <HI>Russ</HI> by Nation, and the
daughter of a poor Priest.</P>
<P>That which is common to all the
<HI>Royal Moschs</HI> is this;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What com∣mon to all the great Moschs.</NOTE> several gates
open into the area; within which
are fountains or conduits full of
cocks and basons for their cleansing,
before they make their prayers;
close adjoyning an Hospital, and
porticos built arch-wise, the little
cuppolas covered with lead running
all along in an even line: usually
four spires or cylindrical towers of a
great heigth, which the Priests ascend
<PB N="310" REF="162"/>
to call the people to their devotion,
raised from the ground, and placed
at a due distance and in opposite
corners including a square space;
except at <HI>Achmets</HI> Mosch, where
there are six. Each of these have a
threefold gallery, one above another.
the tops of these towers are gilt and
end in a point like a pyramid, on
which is placed a gilded Crescent,
the ensign of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> reli∣gion,
and so generally where-ever
there is any <HI>Mosch</HI> or oratory;
though never so mean and little.
The name of <HI>God</HI> or of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
or his <HI>four chief</HI> companions, or the
form of the profession of the <HI>Musul∣man</HI>
faith inscribed upon the inside
of the walls: and lastly, several iron
circles or hoops containing a vast
number of chrystal lamps used to be
lighted at their night prayers: so
that with the reflexion from the
arches and pillars, the Church seems
to be of a light fire.</P>
<P>Within the enclosure of the out∣ward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sepulchral monuments of the Em∣perors.</NOTE>
wall are the sepulchral monu∣ments
of the several Founders and
<PB N="311" REF="162"/>
their children: for no one lies bu∣ried
in their Churches, no not the
Emperors themselves. They are built
of white marble with a cuppola.
The marble coffins, which are very
large and above the proportion of
their bodies, lying in a space encom∣passed
with iron-grates, two great
tapers being placed at the end, are
covered for the most part with a silk
Pall of a deep green, having a good
fringe, their turbants, which they re∣new
every year, being placed over
their heads. Their women lye neer
them; but their coffins are not so
large, nor raised so high from the
ground, covered with purple or vio∣let
cloth. The coffins of their chil∣dren
are bigger or less according to
the age at which they dyed. Such
as have been strangled by their Bro∣thers,
who usually since the reign of
<HI>Bayazid</HI> the second lay the founda∣tion
and beginning of their Empire
in fratricide, have a handkerchief
tied about their necks, as a sign of
their unnatural death. These little
Chappels are frequented by several
<PB N="312" REF="163"/>
Priests and other pensioners, who are
obliged to come and say prayers for
the souls of the deceased. Several
Emperors, who have not been Foun∣ders
of <HI>Moschs,</HI> have their monu∣ments
neer <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> as <HI>Selim</HI>
the son of <HI>Suleiman</HI> with his thirty
seven children; <HI>Morat</HI> the third,
who had a more numerous issue: for
I told about five and forty; <HI>Maho∣met</HI>
the third, <HI>Mustapha</HI> the great
Unkle, and <HI>Ibrahim</HI> the Father of
this present Emperor, both by a
strange fate preferred to the Em∣pire,
and both deprived of it; alike
in their lives and deaths: both
foolish and frantick, and equally
unfit to sustain the weight of the go∣vernment,
and both strangled. Hard
by <HI>Achmet</HI>'s Mosch lye buried his
two sons <HI>Osman</HI> and <HI>Morat,</HI> both
warlike Emperors, who endeavoured
to reduce the souldiery, which
through sloth and luxury had much
degenerated, to their ancient disci∣pline.
The first made away with by
the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> whose ill behaviour
in his expedition against <HI>Poland,</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="163"/>
and other insolencies he could no
longer support, and therefore de∣signed
to have destroyed the whole
order, and to have instituted a new
militia; which they perceiving, they
grew tumultuous and mutinous, and
soon after had him bow-string'd: the
other died with a debauch.</P>
<P>Being at the Mosch of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
the great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Mo∣ther of <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> the great.</NOTE> I had a curiosity to see
the tomb of his Mother, who was
no way shaken by the artifices and
enticements of her Husband and
son from her fixt resolutions of con∣tinuing
in her religion, but lived and
died a <HI>Christian,</HI> being the daughter
of <HI>Lazarus Despot</HI> of <HI>Servia.</HI> Se∣veral
<HI>Turks,</HI> who were there present
in the area, perceiving I bade my
<HI>Janizary</HI> enquire which was her
<HI>Turbeh</HI> or Chappel, immediately be∣fore
they were ask'd, pointed to it
with their finger: which I entred,
and found very plain and unadorned.
The <HI>Turks</HI> care not to come into it:
but several poor <HI>Christians</HI> frequent
it at set hours, and have a small alms
allowed them for the prayers they
make there.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="164"/>
This honour is indulged to some of
the <HI>Bassas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Bas∣sas and</NOTE> who have by their va∣lour
and council highly merited of
the Empire, to be buried in the City,
and to have their sepulchral monu∣ments

the illustrious <HI>Bassa Ibrahim,</HI> to
whom the Emperor <HI>Suleiman</HI> mar∣ried
one of his daughters, in whose
praises the <HI>Turkish</HI> Historians are
so foolishly lavish and extravagant,
who lies buried neer <HI>Suleimania;</HI>
and <HI>Mahomet Kupriuli,</HI> who setled
the government during the minority
of the present Emperor, when it was
almost torn asunder by the factions
of the great men and the mutinies
of the souldiery; buried neer the
Mosch he built in <HI>Taouk-bazar.</HI> In
the suburbs to the West very neer
the haven there are several of these
Chappels: and among others the
tomb of <HI>Sultan Ejub,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Sultan <HI>Ejub,</HI> where</NOTE> a person of

and defending the <HI>Musul∣man</HI>
religion they tell a company of
idle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Signor</HI> is inaugura∣ted.</NOTE> foppish, and ridiculous stories.
In the adjoyning area adorned with
a portico, the new Emperor is in∣augurated,
the <HI>Mufti</HI> girting his
sword about him, this being the on∣ly
ceremony used at his investiture,
and is instead of a coronation. This
place I suppose is chosen out of re∣spect
to the memory of their great
Saint, as if there were something of
good omen in it, and to put the Em∣peror
in mind of what he must do,
if there be occasion, for the advance∣ment
of religion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Janizaries</HI> by vertue of an
old establishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cham∣bers of the <HI>Janizaries.</HI></NOTE> even in times of
peace, that they might the sooner
form themselves into a body, and
prevent any sedition or tumult of
the Citizens, were to live together:
for which purpose there are two
great <HI>Odas</HI> or buildings at a little
distance one from the other at <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>
to receive those who are
quartered there. But by the con∣nivence
of the officers bribed with
<PB N="316" REF="165"/>
money and presents, several are per∣mitted
to be absent; and the mar∣ried
men of the order turn shop∣keepers
and artizans to make better
provision for their wives and chil∣dren.
Between these two chambers
is their <HI>Mosch,</HI> where upon any emer∣gence
of state, that either may have
an influence upon the Empire or
their body, they have their meetings
and consultations.</P>
<P>The Acropolis or <HI>seven Towers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Towers.</NOTE>
in the furthest angle of the City to
the South upon the <HI>Propontis,</HI> serves
rather for a prison, than a garrison:
for though there be a few souldiers
in it, yet I could observe no great
guns or any other warlike furniture.
In the garden belonging to the go∣vernour
of the Castle is the tomb of
<HI>Husain</HI> sirnamed <HI>Delli</HI> or the mad
and furious, who had been <HI>Janizary-Aga</HI>
or General of the <HI>Janizaries</HI>
in <HI>Candia,</HI> where he was strangled
by the command of the <HI>Vizir</HI> for
several pretended miscarriages; but
the true cause of his death was be∣lieved
to be his great merit, which

the other envied, and could not
brook with any patience, and ac∣cordingly
contrived his ruine. But

The few remaining pieces of Anti∣quity
are these:</P>
<P>The Circus or Hippodrome is
about two or three furlongs in
length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippo∣drome.</NOTE> and almost half as wide. At
one end of it is a large Colossus or
Pillar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colossus.</NOTE> the top of it broken down,
having suffered much by fire, and

<P>About the middle there remains
an entire Aguglia or Obelisk of a
kind of Granite or Theban marble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierogly∣phical Pil∣lar.</NOTE>
commonly called the <HI>Hieroglyphical
pillar,</HI> by reason of the several fi∣gures
of animals and other represen∣tations
engraven upon the sides ac∣cording
to the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests and
Philosophers, who used to involve
<PB N="319" REF="166"/>
some trivial slight notices of religion
and nature in such dark and per∣plext
characters. It is of a square
figure, the four sides making so ma∣ny
equilateral triangles, which are
sensibly contracted, as they rise higher
and higher, till they end in a cone.
That which makes it the more ad∣mirable,
is, that it is one entire stone,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as both <HI>Codinus</HI> and <HI>Ma∣nuel
Chrysaloras</HI> call it; whereas the
<HI>Colossus</HI> consists of several pieces.
The Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> raised it
again upon its basis, after it had
been cast down to the ground, (in
all probability by an earthquake, to
which this City is subject) as the
double inscription attests, the one in
<HI>Greek</HI> on the side to the West, the
other in <HI>Latine</HI> to the East; which
while I read with so much ease, the
<HI>Turks</HI> who stood by, (such was their
ignorance and stupidity) were amaz∣ed,
and enquiring after the sense
and meaning, seemed hugely pleased
and satisfied with what I told them.</P>

<P>In the same Piazza is a pillar of
wreathed brass hollowed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpent pillar of brass.</NOTE> at the top
of which are the necks and heads of
three Serpents, which shut out at an
equal distance triangular-wise, This
in all probability was designed a

Magick, according to the credulity
and superstition of those times;
which some fanciful men of late
have very idly and foolishly gone
about to make out and justify.</P>

the great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pillar of <HI>Constan∣tine.</HI></NOTE> which he brought
from old <HI>Rome,</HI> on the top of which
he placed his own statue in brass,
still remains in <HI>Taouk-bazar,</HI> bound
about in several places of the shaft,
where the pieces joyn with brass
hoops; but the marble is much de∣faced
and blackened by fire, the sta∣tue
having been long time tumbled
down.</P>
<P>In <HI>Aurat-bazar</HI> or the womens
market upon an eminence stands
another pillar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Historical pillar.</NOTE> which is seen at a
great distance by such as sail upon
the <HI>Propontis:</HI> it rises to the heigth
of about an hundred and forty feet,
the top being broken off, to which
they ascended by a winding pair of
stairs; several figures in basso rilie∣vo
are engraven upon it, which re∣late
to a warlike expedition of the
Emperour <HI>Arcadius,</HI> upon which
<PB N="322" REF="168"/>
accompt among the <HI>Frankes</HI> it has
got the name of the <HI>Historical
pillar.</HI></P>
<P>In the Western part of the City
toward the Campaigne, but not far
from the haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruines of <HI>Constantines</HI> palace.</NOTE> are the remains of
a certain palace called by the <HI>Turks
Tekir Serai,</HI> and by the <HI>Greeks</HI> sup∣posed
to be that of <HI>Constantine,</HI> who
was the last Emperour, and the Son
of an <HI>Helena</HI> too, the last fate as
well as first glory of <HI>Constantinople</HI>
deriving from the same names. In
the lower part there is only left
standing a chamber adorned with
curious wrought pillars of the <HI>Co∣rinthian</HI>
order, and above, a large
stately hall. The other places are
filled and stuffed up with ruines.</P>
<P>That <HI>Constantinople,</HI> tho lying
upon the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aqueducts.</NOTE> might not be destitute
of fresh water, which is so useful
and necessary to life, was the chief
care of the Emperour <HI>Valentinian,</HI>
who caused aqueducts to be raised,
by which the water is conveyed to
the City from hill to hill in a wind∣ing
compass the space of eighteen
<PB N="323" REF="168"/>
miles. But these by the sloth and
carelesness of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI>
falling to decay and rendred useless,
were restored and refitted by the
Emperor <HI>Suleiman,</HI> who was so in∣tent
upon this great work, that he
said he would go on with it, although
the laying every stone stood him in
a purse of money, that is, five hun∣dred
dollars; and it was one of the
three things he so earnestly wisht he
might live to effect, the other two
being the finishing of the <HI>Mosch</HI>
which bears his name, and the ma∣king
himself Master of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>The springs arise hard by a Vil∣lage
called <HI>Domus-deri,</HI> which lies
toward the black Sea, whose waters
are conveyed partly through little
channels, and partly through pipes
under ground into several large ci∣sterns,
nigh which are summer hou∣ses,
floored,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kiosks</HI> or summer-houses.</NOTE> and sometimes the ciel∣ing
painted, and the sides crusted
with a kind of porcellane: the tops
rising pyramidally, where the better
sort of <HI>Turks</HI> in the heats of summer
retire to enjoy the cool air, and for
<PB N="324" REF="169"/>
the shady walks, bringing sometimes
their women with them, and spend
there several days, pitching their
tents for their better accommodati∣on.
Here it is, and here alone, that
they seem to live gentily, and under∣stand
how to make use of the con∣veniences
and delights of nature.
Every one here is a Prince, and fan∣cies
himself for a time in Paradise.
These cisterns are of different figures,
square,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cisterns.</NOTE> round, oblong, hexagonal,
made of free-stone, the bottom either
paved or plaistered over, into which
you descend by a pair of stairs
sometimes twenty foot deep. Two
of these above the rest are very
stately, both within a mile of <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI>
the one to the East, the other
to the South-west. From this lat∣ter
the waters are conveyed to the
first Aqueduct neer a <HI>Greek</HI> Village
called <HI>Pyrgos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pyrgos.</NOTE> the <HI>Christians</HI> of which,
as of the neighbouring Villages, are
free from paying <HI>haratch</HI> or head-money
for their care in looking af∣ter
the waters. This is a very mag∣nificent
pile of building, and of a
<PB N="325" REF="169"/>
great length, with a double range of
arches about eight and forty or
fifty in number, joyning two hills,
and in the middle to the bottom of
the valley it may be about one hun∣dred
feet: the water running in a
covered channel at the top. Not
far on the other side of the plain is
another great Aqueduct, which
makes an angle, having three ranges
of arches one above another. On
one line are two and twenty arches
in the uppermost range, through
which and the other below it are
two galleries about five foot wide,
in some places shut up on each side,
in others open at the regular di∣stance
of about twelve foot: the
contrivance was but necessary: for
after the fall of rains or melting of
the snow, which in some winters lies
here very deep, there are such bogs
below in the valleys, that no horse
can pass that way: the other line is
shorter, and consists of twelve arches,
which grow less and less according
to the greater or lesser steepiness of
the hill. Hence about a mile you
<PB N="326" REF="170"/>
pass to a third Aqueduct: which
indeed is a most splendid and glo∣rious
structure, containing only four
arches in two ranges, the distance of
the sides of the arches being above
fifty foot. This Aqueduct is raised
to a great heigth, whence the waters
pass in an uninterrupted course, and
fall into a large cistern in the City
neer <HI>Sultan Selims Mosch,</HI> and so by
earthen pipes are conveyed to the se∣veral
houses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> have six and twenty
Churches in <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greecian</HI> Churches.</NOTE> and six
in <HI>Galata;</HI> of which I have given
an account elsewhere.</P>
<P><HI>Galata,</HI> as it appears from an old
survey in the times of the Emperors
<HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Galata.</NOTE> made up
the thirteenth and fourteenth Regi∣ons,
that there might be the same
number in <HI>new Rome,</HI> as <HI>Constantine</HI>
would have his new City also called,
as in the old. It is situated on the
North side of the haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haven.</NOTE> by which
it is divided from <HI>Constantinople.</HI>
The passage is very easy, and a great
number of boat-men get their living
<PB N="327" REF="170"/>
by carrying passengers to and again
continually. This arm of the Sea
is about half a mile wide, and in
length from the <HI>Seraglio-point</HI> to the
fresh water rivers between four and
five miles; of a great depth, that
Ships of a considerable burthen may
lye with their bolt-sprits ashore, and
have several fathoms of water at the
stern; and so secure withal, being
shut up with the several high hills
and promontories, which break the
force and violence of the wind and
waves, that let the weather be ne∣ver
so ill, and the Sea boisterous in
the <HI>Propontis,</HI> the Vessels are not in
the least stirred with it in this narrow
strait. The Arsenal is to the West,
where there are several voltas or
chambers built arch-wise, where they
hall up their Galleys after the sum∣mer
expedition is over.</P>
<P><HI>Galata</HI> of it self, both for the
compass of the ground it takes up,
and its strength, may be justly ac∣counted
a large City, and is very
populous. It is encompassed with
walls flankered with towers, built
<PB N="328" REF="171"/>
by the Emperor <HI>Anastasius,</HI> having
a wide and deep ditch to the land∣ward.
It runs along the side of a
hill, higher than those of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
and in several places is very
steep. Formerly toward the declen∣sion
of the <HI>Greecian</HI> Empire it was
in the possession of the <HI>Genoueses;</HI>
the arms of some noble Families of
that republick are still here and
there to be seen engraven in the
walls. Without which, both upon
the ridge of the hill and upon the
plain, farther in, toward and parallel
with the haven, are several large
streets, which whole tract of ground,
by reason of its situation on the
other side of the water, is therefore
called by the <HI>Greek</HI> name <HI>Pera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pera▪</NOTE>
where most of the <HI>Christian Am∣bassadors</HI>
choose both for their con∣venience
and privacy to make their
residence.</P>
