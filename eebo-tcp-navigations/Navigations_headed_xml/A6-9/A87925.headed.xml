<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in <HI>AMERICA,</HI> to his Friend in <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOLSTON</HI> <DATE><HI>November</HI> 8th. 1699.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote to you from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> giving account of the Shameful Desertion of <HI>Caledonia:</HI> I doubt not but long ere now, the Company is sensible of the true Cause, and hath taken Care to prevent the like for the Fu∣ture: It seems strange, that Persons of known Integrity, Courage, and Experience, could not be sent and Commissionat for the Management of a Concern of so Great Importance. Whatever may be the Discourse of their want of Provisions, I know very well we have such Friends in the <HI>English</HI> Plan∣tations, as contrary to any Proclamation or Prohibition, would have supplyed and may yet supply, the said Colony, with all necessar Provisions, if they have timely Notice and Encouragement from the Company.</P>
<P>One of the two Ships that were sent with a Supply of 300 Men, hath been at <HI>Caledonia,</HI> and is come to <HI>Jamaica:</HI> We long to hear of the Recruits expect∣ed with the <HI>Rising-Sun:</HI> And hope when they Arrive, they may Re-settle the Place. Its also hoped for, and thought necessar, that the Company do not give over, as if no more were requisit for securing the Colony (Its well known the <HI>Spanish, French,</HI> and Others, will use all their Art, Fraud, and Force, to Hinder, Undermine, and Ruin it) but that they continue their Supplies of Men, Arms, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> untill they be Certified their Colony is beyond Danger from all their Enemies.</P>
<P>We hope the great Loss sustained, shall not Discourage nor abate the Zeal of any Concerned: Such undertakings do not presently Ripen and Enrich the Adventurers: What tho the Company see no Return for Seven Years? The Place is worth Ten times the Charge: And in time will fully re-imburse them, if Mountains of Gold, or being the Staple of Trade for both sides of <HI>America,</HI> can do it; Besides the Blessing of Heaven, which we may expect to the Messengers of the glad Tidings of Salvation to People in Darkness.</P>
