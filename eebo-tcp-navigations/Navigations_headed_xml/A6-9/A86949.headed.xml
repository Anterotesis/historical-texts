<HEAD>THE Speech of Sir Henry Hide, Agent for the King of Scotland, to the Emperour of <HI>Turkie,</HI> on the Scaffold at the place of Execution, against the Royal Ex∣change in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> onn <HI>Tuesday March</HI> 4. 1651.</HEAD>
<P>SIr <HI>Henry Hide</HI> (late Agent for the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Emperour of <HI>Turkie</HI>) having for these two years last past, been very active in forrein Countries, for the advancing of his Masters prerogative and power against the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and also endeavouring (what in him lay) to obstruft all tra∣ding and commerce between the English Marchants, and others; and in order thereunto, some time he spent at <HI>Smerney</HI> in <HI>Turkie,</HI> for the better accomplish∣ing thereof; but finding his negotiations and consul∣tations to be no way feacible, he rode from thence to the city of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> soliciting the Vice-Roy a∣bout many things of great and dangerous conse∣quence; but the Marchants (occasioned by many fears and jealousies) having made a great discovery
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>of his design; and being likewise informed that he was determined to seize and secure their ships, &amp;c. for the use and service of his Master; they immediat∣ly resolved to send forth a considerable party to in∣tercept him in his return from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Smer∣ney;</HI> which accordingly they did (to his great asto∣nishment) and brought him aboard the <HI>Dragon,</HI> tran∣sporting the said Sir <HI>Henry</HI> from thence to <HI>London,</HI> where by special authority, and command from the Parliament, he was sent prisoner to the Tower; and after few dayes, brought to a Tryal before the High Court of Justice in Westminster Hall, and by Them adjudged guilty of high Treason against the Com∣mon-wealth of <HI>England;</HI> receiving this Sentence of Death, <HI>To have his head severed from his shoulders at the Old Exchange, London, on Tuesday the fourth of March</HI> 1651. which accordingly was performed, in the pre∣sence of many thousand spectators; the manner whereof, together with his Speech, Prayer, and De∣portment, in effect, followeth.</P>
<P>On Tuesday being the 4 of this instant, Sir <HI>Henry Hide</HI> was brought from the Tower, in a Coach, to the place of execution, being guarded with a Troop of horse, and accompanied by the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and the Lieutenant of the Tower; when he came upon the Scaffold, he put off his hat to the spectators, de∣porting himself with great cheerfulnesse, and un∣dantednesse of spirit: then turning himself about, he desired to see his Coffin, which was accordingly shewed him, a black mourning cloth being also pre∣pared to cover the same. Then turning himself again to the people, and leaning over the railes of the Scaf∣fold, spake as followeth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Good People,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur coming hither to day is to behold a sad spectacle, where you may apparently discern an Object of pity; I am by a law condemned to die, and I thank my God that hath appointed me this death for mine offence, for I have alwayes lived a sin∣ner, and offended my God, for which I humbly im∣plore and desire a general remission and forgivenesse. I am come hither to pay the wages of death, and to sacrifice my life for my obedience and loyalty to my Master the King, for whose sake, I was ever wil∣ling to adventure both life and fortunes. But as for those things laid to my charge, of having a design against the English Marchants, I here protest my innocency thereof; neither did ever the least thought of evil or prejudice arise within my breast, against this my Native Countrey of England; but alwayes desired its prosperity and happinesse; under a quiet and peaceable Government, &amp;c. Much more was said to this purpose, and delivered with great ap∣plause and earnestnesse of spirit to the spectators: Having ended his speech, he turned himself about to Sheriff <HI>Tichburn,</HI> who was all in mourning, and after some queries and answers, uttered many divine and excellent expressions; desiring them to joyn in pray∣er with him; and kneeling upon his coffin, with his hat in his right hand, and his black mourning gloves in the left, most fervently besought the Lord by prayer, humbly supplicating himself before his Di∣vine Majesty, in manner and form as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>His immediate and fervent Prayer before his Execution.</HEAD>
<P>O Lord Jesus, which art the onely health of all men living, and the e∣verlasting life of them which dy in thee; I wretched sinner do submit my self wholy to thy blessed Wil; and being sure that that thing cannot perish which is committed to thy mercy; willingly now I leave this frail and wicked flesh, in sure hope that thou wilt most glori∣ously restore it to me again at the last day, in the resurrection of the just: I beseech thee most merciful God, that thou wilt by thy grace make strong my faith against all temptations, and defend me with the buckler of thy mercy a∣gainst all the assaults of Satan. I see, and know, that there is no hope of salvati∣on, but by Thee, O God, and thy Son,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the Saviour of the World, into whose hands I recommend my spirit; for my confidence and trust is in thy most merciful goodness: O Lord, I have no merits, nor good works, that I may al∣ledge before thee: Of sins and evil works (alas) I see a great heap; but yet through thy mercy, I trust to be in the number of them, to whom thou wilt not impute their sins; but receive them as inheritors of thy everlasting king∣dome. O thou sweet Jesus of Heaven, that wast born for my sake, and gavest thy most precious bloud to be shed upon the Cross for my sake, humbly I beseech thee, in these thy sufferings, gra∣ciously to vouchsafe an interest to me; and grant, O most merciful Father, that when death shal shut up the eyes of my body, yet the eyes of my soul may stil behold and look upon Thee;
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>and when Death hath taken the use of my Tongue, yet my Heart may cry, and say unto Thee, Lord into thy hands I commend my soul; Lord Jesus receive my soul.</P>
<P>Having ended his prayer, he rose from his Coffin whereon he kneeled, and turning to Sheriff <HI>Titchborn,</HI> gave him a salutation: Then the Executione came to him, and asked him forgivenesse: Sir <HI>Henry</HI> replyed, <HI>I freely forgive thee, and all mine enemies; and as a signal thereof, here's</HI> 3 l. <HI>for thee.</HI> Then the Executioner took the Block, and placed it on the Scaffold, and Sir <HI>Henry</HI> prepared himself for the same, pulling off his Cloak, Doublet, and Band, and gave them to his man; which done, he went to the block, and kneeling down, laid his neck thereon, to try how it would fit: suddenly he arose again, taking his last farewel of the minister, who came along with him, and the rest of his friends; and kneeling down again the second time, the Exe∣cutioner spread a red Scarf over the block, desiring the sign; to which he answered, By the stretceing forth my hands: Then, after kissing the Ax and block, casting his eyes up to heaven, earnestly cryed out, Lord Jesus receive my soul; and patiently submit∣ting to the block, immediatly gave the sign, which the Executioner diligently observing, at one blow severed his head from his shoulders; the head mov'd three times after it was off; but neither body, hands, nor feet once stir'd Presently after the blow was gi∣ven, both head and body were put into a Coffin, and so carryed away from off the Scaffold.</P>
