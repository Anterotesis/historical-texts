<HEAD>NEGRO PONTE, <HI>Anciently called</HI> EUBOEA.</HEAD>
<P>IT Lyes to the North of Boeotia extending North West and South East about 120 miles; Its Breadth, at the broadest place not above 30. It was taken from the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the year 1471. The soil is very fertile, affording all sorts of Graine, Wine, and Oyle, as likewise Flesh and Fowl; the Sea abounding with Fish. Since the <HI>Turks</HI> have had possession of it, most of the <HI>Greeks</HI> are Fled from the Villages, and Townes; So as the inland places are mostly supplyed by <HI>Al∣baneses,</HI> who are the Shepherds, and serve the <HI>Turks</HI> at their Farmes. Formerly here were two Citys, and 500. Townes and Villages; Now there is but one, which can be called a City, which is the ancient <HI>Chalcis</HI> and now hath the name of the Island; by the <HI>Turks</HI> it is called <HI>Egriboz.</HI> It stands on a point of Land, having the Sea two Thirds about it. Betwixt it and the Maine is a small Island, with a strong Castle. From the Maine to the small Island is a bridge built up∣on six good Arches, and thence to the Maine
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>Castle is a draw-bridge about 30 yards Long. The Maine Castle is two miles in compass, for∣tified with six very large Towers, or Rondells; The walls are high and thick with a dry ditch to the Land, which is almost filled up with rub∣bish. To the South of the Castle is a new Platt-Forme with severall very large Gunns, which carry stone Shot of about 18 inches diameter. When I was there in the year 1676. a Renegado was taken; He was a Greek born on the Island of <HI>Candy;</HI> &amp; turned Turk when the <HI>Vizier</HI> was at the Siege of <HI>Candy;</HI> afterwards he marryed at <HI>Scio,</HI> and lived very well; but upon some discontent he made his escape from <HI>Scio,</HI> and got to the Privateers of <HI>Malta,</HI> with whom he lived some years; &amp; landing on this Island, he with some others were surpriz∣ed, and taken. His companions were condemned to the Gallys, but his sentence was to be shott away, out of one of these great Gunns, which was accordingly effected.</P>
<P>None but <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> live within the Ca∣stle, where are very spacious houses, and four which deserve the name of <HI>Seraglios;</HI> One for the Basha, at the right hand coming into the Castle from the Port; One for his Lievetenant or Ki∣ahja; a Third belonging to <HI>Ibrahim Aga</HI>'s Son (of whose Father we will speak anon;) and the Fourth, to <HI>Muzlee Aga;</HI> Which are very richly set out with carved work and painting. At the
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>latter I was very often entertained upon the fol∣lowing account. <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI> was taken a Slave in the year 1660, &amp; sold at <HI>Legorne,</HI> where he conti∣nued several years, and served as a Porter about the Streets, paying his Master dayly what he got. He won the favour of M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>William Mico</HI> (an English Merchant) who besides his due, would often give him some small matter, &amp; recommend∣ed him to others of his friends. <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI> con∣fiding in M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mico,</HI> imparts the circumstances of his present condition to him, telling him he had good freinds, who would redeem him, and withall desired M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Mico</HI> to use his interest with his Patron, to be moderate in exacting his Ran∣som, giving him a Letter, to be sent to his friends at <HI>Negro Ponte,</HI> but without his Patron's know∣ledge. M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Mico</HI> pursuant to his humble Ad∣dress, did obtaine his ransom on easy terms. Soon after orders came from <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI>'s freinds to buy his ransom for five hundred pie∣ces of Eight, which they would pay at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Which was short by two hundred of what was agreed for. Upon <HI>Muzlee Aga</HI>'s obligation M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Mico</HI> frees him, and sends him to <HI>Smyrna</HI> to M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Richard Langly;</HI> in whose house he tarried, un∣till the remainder of the mony was sent him, which he paid, and went to his friends. I then lived at <HI>Smyrna</HI> with Mr. <HI>Langley;</HI> And now being at <HI>Negro Ponte</HI> sitting in the Coffee
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>house, one morning, I observed him to look ve∣ry often on me, and rising from his place he came to me, asking me what Country man I was, from whence I came, and whether I was going. I told him that I was an English man, come from <HI>Patrass,</HI> and was going to <HI>Constanti∣nople;</HI> Then, says he, you are the Man I took you for, and I thank God, that I have an oppor∣tunity to requite the kindnesses, that I have re∣ceived from your Nation. He would often have me to eat with him. In the year 1679. I was here again, coming from <HI>Athens</HI> I was robb'd by some <HI>Albaneses. Muzlee Aga</HI> gets me passage on a <HI>Lundra</HI> (built in form like a Galley, more for burthen, and sayling, than rowing) for <HI>Scio,</HI> send∣ing aboard 6 henns, 10 oakes, (an oak is about two pound eight ounces English) of white Bisket, 10 oakes of Wine, a Jarr of Olives, and a Jarr of Pettmesh, recommending me to the <HI>Reys</HI> (or Ma∣ster) saying, <HI>I recommend this man to you, when you see him, you see me, what you do to him, you do for me, and I will answer it, be it good or ill.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding their fine houses in the Ca∣stle, the <HI>Basha</HI> has a very large house to the NW<SUP>t</SUP>. of the Castle, near the Gally Haven. In the Ca∣stle are two Mosques; the one was a Church de∣dicated to S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Mark.</HI> There are severall Wells, but most of the water which serves to drink is brought in with Jarrs. About a furlong from
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>the Castle, is the New Town very well built (after the Turkish manner) with a large <HI>Bazare</HI> or Market-place. Here are two Mosques, and se∣veral Greek Churches. The Christians here, are thrice the Number of the Turks, and Jews. The Jesuites have also a small Chappel in their house; Their care is to look after the Slaves, when the Gallys are there. Between the Castle and the Town is their Burying place, set out with many fine peeces of Marble, most of which are brought from the ruins of <HI>Athens.</HI> The Harbour is very secure against any wind, it may be said to be a Port for above two miles, the main land be∣ing so near and the ground good ankor hold. It is secured from an Enemy by the Castle, which has above twenty good Gunns planted this way. Upon the whole Island, there is but one place more, which may be called a Town, which is <HI>Castel Rosso,</HI> by the Turks called <HI>Kisil Hisar.</HI> It was formerly called <HI>Caristus,</HI> (as the Greeks still call it) standing in a deep Bay, at the SE<SUP>t</SUP>. of the Island. The Castle stands on a high and steep hill, above a mile from the Sea, having a large plain, which stretcheth towards the SW<SUP>t</SUP>. But affords little be∣sides Mulberry trees, whereof there are store. The Town is built stragling upon two Mountains Most of the houses are very mean, being made of red earth, dryed in the Sun. The Castle is to the East∣ward standing very advantageously to defend it
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>self against an Enemy. The Bay is open to the South Winds. Vessels which come from <HI>Canea, Malvasia, Napoli, Athens,</HI> or other parts, that way, and bound for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> do usually put in here to inquire for news of Privateers. For from the Mountains, to the North of the Castle, in a clear day may be seen the high Land of <HI>Scio;</HI> and no Vessel can pass the Streight of <HI>Andros,</HI> but what is seen from hence. Small Vessels use to come here for shelter against the Privateers, but have been carryed away by them in the night; to prevent which one <HI>Ibrahim Aga,</HI> at his own charge, built a Fort of an Octagon figure with two Teer of Guns, 16 Guns in each Teer. After he had finished it, an order came from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to have him Strangled. He had some Private E∣nemy who gave the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to understand, that he had some bad thoughts, in building this Fort. His Estate was all confiscated; But through the intercession of great freinds it was most part recovered for the use of his Son, who lived at <HI>Ne∣gro Ponte.</HI></P>
<P>To the W<SUP>t</SUP>. of this Place, is a large Bay called <HI>Porto Buffolo,</HI> which is able to contain many thousand ships. A Greek Priest told me that <HI>Xerxes</HI> had here above 1500 saile of ships, and other Vessels of warr. Close by the water side, to the Eastward, are a great many marble Pillars; All ships that come to lade <HI>Velania</HI> (i. e. dryed Acorns)
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>carry some away. Two miles to the North of the Port are a great many ruins more, and seve∣ral foundations of walls.</P>
<P>On a Mountain more Northerly is a great wall, above three miles about, and close by it is a Vil∣lage called <HI>Cupa.</HI> The ruined place they told me was called <HI>Amatos.</HI> To the North are several good Ports, and there the Inhabitants live more secure than to the South. They reckon to be upon the whole Island not above 60000 soules, of which not above 10000 <HI>Turks,</HI> who most live under the command of the Castles at <HI>Negro Ponte,</HI> and <HI>Castel Rosso.</HI> Here is abundance of silks made, most of which is carryed to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> towards payment of their tribute, and <HI>Decimos.</HI> The <HI>Grand Signor</HI>'s Revenue from this great Island, is about 100000 Dollars. As to the Tides motion at the Bridg, I will not trouble the Reader with the several opinions, that men have about it; only that it has been observed by several others, as well as my self, that sometimes it will pass contrary at the one side to the other, and this commonly on a Southerly wind. The next Island we come to in rank to the East is</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>ANDROS.</HEAD>
<P>This keeps its name, being called by the Turks <HI>Endros.</HI> The Inhabitants are all Greeks, having a
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>good large Town to the NE<SUP>t</SUP>. with no other walls, but those of their houses, which join together. At the end of the lanes are Gates, which every night are shut, to keep out the Privateers. In the Mountains are several small Villages, which are built so convenient as they can see an Enemy, long before he comes; so they have time to hide themselves, and the best of their goods, in places made by their Industry in the Rocks. Upon the whole Island there are not above 3000 Inhabitants, They have a great many Mulberry trees, and some years make above 10000 pound of Silk. They agree at <HI>Constantinople</HI> for about 10000 Dollars yearly, tho it stands them in above 12000: besides what the Privateers steal from them. Corn and Wine are here very plentifull, but their main stock is raised from Silk, and Cat∣tle. with the latter, and other provisions they supply <HI>Tine.</HI> There are several good Harbours for small Vessels, but only one for ships, which is to the SE<SUP>t</SUP>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>TINE,</HI> formerly called <HI>TENOS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And by the Turks <HI>Stendill,</HI> lyes to the SE<SUP>t</SUP>. of <HI>Andros,</HI> being, about 70 miles in compass, and the highest land of any of the Islands in the <HI>Archi∣pelago.</HI> It is under the Venetian Government and withstood the <HI>Turks</HI> all the warrs; notwith∣standing
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>they landed their Army several times. In the year 1658. the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> came to a Port to the N<SUP>h</SUP>. called <HI>La Colebitre,</HI> when in the night he landed 6000 men, hoping to surprize them; But the vigilant Islanders soon fled from their habitations, and betook themselves to the Castle, surrounding the hill, under the great Gunns. The <HI>Proveditore</HI> dispatcht away a <HI>Fe∣lucca</HI> to acquaint the Captain General at <HI>Argen∣tiero;</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> finding they could not take the Castle, destroyed the Country, burnt the houses, and carryed away about 10 slaves. The Castle stands on a high rock on the top of the Mountain. It is much higher than any other part of the Island, so as it may be discerned at both sides of the Island. Upon any occasion of re∣joycing, Fires were made upon the top of the Castle, which have been seen at the Island of <HI>Scio.</HI> The Inhabitants are most Greeks, but these the greatest part are Roman Catholicks, who have <HI>here</HI> a Bishop. His Palace is at a place cal∣led <HI>Campos,</HI> to the NW<SUP>t</SUP>. of the Castle, distant from it about 3 miles. There are above thirty Villages upon this Island, and above 20000 souls. Those of the Greek Religion are to the Eastward end of the Island, having many pleasant Villages; though seated among Rocks. <HI>Tine</HI> hath but one Port, which is secure for shipping. It lyes in the strait of <HI>Andros,</HI> called <HI>Palermo.</HI> But the Road,
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>where the ships usually come to unload, is called S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Niccolo,</HI> about 6 miles South from the Castle to the East is S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Zuanni,</HI> a small Port for Boats. To the North is another called <HI>La Cullebithra.</HI> This Island has ever been a great Eye-sore to the <HI>Turks.</HI> In the late Warr of <HI>Candia,</HI> several Bri∣gantines were mann'd out of this place; which did continually torment the <HI>Turks</HI> in all their Quarters. A famous Privateer, called <HI>Georgio Maria,</HI> was a terror to all the sea-Towns about the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> He was of <HI>Corsica,</HI> of a good Family. He came into the service of the <HI>Venetians</HI> with a small <HI>Briganteen,</HI> called the <HI>Lepetto</HI> (or little Fox) his success was so great, that he built at <HI>Bagnio</HI> a place for slaves made square, to the East of the City on the hill, in which was an account of up∣wards 4000 that he had brought out of <HI>Turky</HI> into slavery, of which he gave the tenth to the Generall. From a small Vessel he came to com∣mand a squadron of three ships and Eleven <HI>Bri∣ganteens.</HI> I will not give you an account at large of his several Victories, if I should, it would swell my Narrative to too great a Vo∣lume. I will therefore only give you a Relation of his Death. In the year 1667 <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> had been very succesful against the <HI>Turks,</HI> carrying a∣way whole Towns at a time, so as complaint was carryed from all parts to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where his name was in every sea-faring-mans mouth.

There was in Port at <HI>Scio</HI> 36 Gallys, and six ships of <HI>Tripoli.</HI> The Captain <HI>Basha</HI> sent orders to the ships, to be ready to sayle with his Gallys.

With the help of his <HI>Briganteens</HI> he gets his ships out to the North of the Islands, ordering the <HI>Briganteens</HI> to shift for themselves; taking his last farewell of them. The Fight was very sharp above 6 hours. <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> was kill'd, and his body thrown over board, (as he had desired his friends to do) that it might not come into the hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>his ship was taken, another was sunk, and the third made its escape into the Bay of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and so to <HI>Tine.</HI> Of the Turks were killed and wound∣ed above two thousand, of which in the <HI>Tripoly</HI> ships above 300. In the ship where <HI>Georgio Ma∣ria</HI> was, (of 200 men) not above 20 were taken a∣live, and those most of them wounded. After this Victory the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> went to <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> towing up the ship in great Triumph at his Gallys Stern, as he past the <HI>Serraglio</HI> point. No man since <HI>Scanderbeigh</HI> has been so great a plague to the <HI>Turks.</HI> His loss was generally lamented by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but especially by those of this Island, whom he very much inriched.

<HEAD>MICONE.</HEAD>
<P>Keeps its name, lying to the SE<SUP>t</SUP>. of <HI>Tine,</HI> about 12 miles distant, being near 40 miles about. It has but one Town bearing the name of the Island, which is at the NW<SUP>t</SUP>. part, without any Fortifi∣cation. It is a large Town, having many <HI>Greek Churches,</HI> and one <HI>Latine Church,</HI> which serves when any Privateers come; for here are very few other than of the <HI>Greek Religion.</HI> Most of the Inhabitants are Privateers, who serve with the <HI>Legorneses</HI> and <HI>Malteses,</HI> leaving their women to their own discretion, and the Civility of stran∣gers. The chief product of the Islands is Wine, Corne, and Fruit. The <HI>Venetians</HI> usually in time of peace come with their ships, and provide themselves with wine. But the greatest of their profit is from Privateers. The women are here very Beautiful, and want not for husbands. Those, who go to sea, are the younger sort of their men, and when they have well stock't themselves with gaine, come and spend it here. This Island is very near the Road from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> and seldom is it free from Privateers. Great complaint has been made to the Port, and
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>every year the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> did threaten them; but the crafty old men (whom they call their <HI>Vec∣chiardi</HI>) use to meet the <HI>Basha</HI> at <HI>Scio,</HI> in a sad condition, complayning that they must leave the Island in case the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> did not allow them a Castle and Garrison; pretending they could not command in their own houses, while the Privateers were there: and representing their condition in a most deplorable manner, for se∣veral years they prevented the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> from coming to Visit them, injoying their time in the best manner they could. In the year 1680 in the month of <HI>September,</HI> one <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI> takes a <HI>Saik,</HI> which came from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> very richly loaden, which <HI>Saik</HI> he carrys to <HI>Micone,</HI> where he divided the prize amongst his Companions, letting the <HI>Reys</HI> (or Master who was a Greek of <HI>Metelino</HI>) have his freedom to depart. The <HI>Reys</HI> pretended he would go for <HI>Venice,</HI> and to have passage thither, he would pass to <HI>Tine,</HI> telling <HI>Anzolo Maria</HI> that he had no mony to defray his expence, and so desired his charity. <HI>Anzolo Ma∣ria</HI> gave him 10 Dollars, with which he depart∣ed for <HI>Tine,</HI> where he found a Boat ready to saile for <HI>Scio.</HI> Upon which he imbarques, and arrived there the next morning. Here he findes the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> ready to go for <HI>Constantinople;</HI> to him he runs, giving him an account of the loss he had sustained from <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI> whom he left
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>but two days before at <HI>Micone.</HI> No sooner had the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> notice, but immediatly he gives the signe for departure. About midnight he sailes from <HI>Scio,</HI> and the next day about noon came before <HI>Micone.</HI> The weather being rainy and thick, he was not seen by the <HI>Miconiotes,</HI> till he was almost in the Haven; But comes into the Harbour to the Southward of the Town, and immediatly landed 2000 <HI>Levents</HI> (Soldiers of the Gallies) to take possession of all the Boates and other Vessels, that were in the Harbour be∣fore the Town. While <HI>Anzolo Maria</HI> was at din∣ner with his friends, news was brought him, that the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> was arrived at the back side of the Town, and had landed his <HI>Levents;</HI> upon which he immediatly went to a Point of land where was a small fisher boat, in which he and another man put to Sea, and notwithstanding the Seas run very high, they passed over to <HI>Delos,</HI> in sight of all the Gallys; the wind being so strong as none of the Gallys could get out to pur∣sue him, and most thought it impossible he could escape drowning.</P>
<P>We leave him to his Fate, and come back to <HI>Micone,</HI> where the Scene is strangely alter'd since morning, when all had their best attir's on, singing and dancing in every house. Now they had all unstript themselves, seeking places to hide their fine clothes, and husbands, whose singing
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>was turned into weeping and wailing. The <HI>Vec∣chiardi</HI> were sent for, to whom the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> said, <HI>Bring me Anzolo Maria immediatly, or I will hang you up at the Gally-yard.</HI> The Captain <HI>Ba∣sha</HI>'s name was <HI>Kaplan Basha,</HI> he was a man of great Resolution, and subject to Paslion. The <HI>Vecchiardi</HI> summon'd all the inhabitants, ordering the Priests to excommunicate all those who should conceal <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI> or any of his companions, and not bring them out before the Captain <HI>Basha.</HI> Ten of his intimate companions were found, and carryed aboard the <HI>Basha</HI>'s Gallys; None of these knew of <HI>Anzolo Maria</HI>'s escape, nor did va∣lue their lives, to save his. Most of them were <HI>Venetians,</HI> and <HI>Sclavonians;</HI> the <HI>Basha</HI> ordered them to be put in Irons till next morning, and that night every house in the town was searched, not a Chest but what was emptied and the Vaults in the Churches open'd to look for Privateers, so as that night above two hundred men were clapt into Irons. The wife of <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI> and her Mother, were put into the Custody of the <HI>Kiahja</HI> that night. Next morning the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> sent again for the <HI>Vecchiardi,</HI> threatning to hang them, if they did not produce <HI>Anzolo Maria. They told him that he was certainly got out of the Island in a small Boat, and without question must have perished in the Sea.</HI> Then he ordered the 10 men, which were Comrades of <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>to be brought before him. To the first he said; <HI>Confess if you know where your Captain is, and you shall have your liberty.</HI> To which he boldly ans∣wered; <HI>That he knew not, and if he did know, he would sooner loose his life, than discover him.</HI> A∣gain says the <HI>Basha, if you do not discover to me where he is, immediatly your head shall be separat∣ed from your body.</HI> He answered boldly, <HI>I am in your power, you may do what you please with me, and if I might have my choice, I had rather dye than be your Slave.</HI> He was immediatly beheaded in the pre∣sence of his Companions, thereby to terrifie them. A second came, to whom the <HI>Basha</HI> offer'd as to the first, but he was in the same tune with his companion. Then sayes the <HI>Basha, upon my word</HI> (taking his beard in his hand) <HI>if any one of you discover to me where</HI> Anzolo Maria <HI>is, you shall have your libertys, and mony to carry you out of the Country;</HI> But they all were of the first mans reso∣lution. At first the <HI>Basha</HI> resolved to take away all their lives, but upon more mature consideration, he only condemned them to the Gallys. After these was brought a Chirurgion who had often cured <HI>Anzolo Maria</HI> of his wounds, he was laid down and thrash't on the Feet with small sticks 100 blows; then was brought to the <HI>Basha,</HI> who or∣der'd the Executioner to be present, threatning him to have his head taken off, if he did not find out <HI>Anzolo Maria.</HI> The Chirurgion told him he
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>had not seen him, in above three days, he was then laid down again, and received two hundred stripes on the Buttocks, two hundred on the Bel∣ly, and being in a Swoon, he was carred away. Thus was he used for three days. All the flesh of his feet came off, his belly was much blister'd, and his Buttocks were like unto <HI>Carbonados.</HI> I saw him before he was perfectly cured, and from his mouth, and several of the <HI>Vecchiardi,</HI> I had this account. The wife of <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI> and her Mother, to make them confess, were served as follows. They were stript and put into two pair of Greek breeches, which were drawn up above their knees, the upper part tyed above their breasts, and their hands tied up to a Post. Into each pair of breeches, was put a young Kittling, which were beaten with small sticks, which made them leap up and down about the Breeches, and exercize their claws upon the womens bodys. Thrice were they thus served. For a week did the <HI>Basha</HI> continue in this Island, and carryed away with him what riches he could find, (pre∣tending they belonged to <HI>Anzolo Maria</HI>) with 100 young men that had been with the Priva∣teers. He threatned the <HI>Vecchiardi,</HI> that if he heard, that they received <HI>Anzolo Maria,</HI> or suf∣fered the Privateers to come upon the Island, he would hang every one of them, and make their

Next morning the Priest brings one of the Islan∣ders; he first took a good swig at the bottle, and by our directions he soon found out the hole, he ordered a piece of lead to be cut square, and daubed with oakham and tarr, which he nayled over the leak so as our ship was again very sound. He first put the nailes into the lead, then diving, by degrees drove them into the ship side. He was some times above a minute under water.

There is no secure harbour for Gallys, or small Vessels; But for ships there is a good Port to the Eastward, where the Town stands on a high hill, having a ruined Castle.

<P>Are good Islands, but they are continually plagued with the Privateers; so as all that their land doth produce, will but serve to pay their taxes; if any can be said to have the prehemi∣nence, it is S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Erino,</HI> here being several Mer∣chants, who have some power amongst the <HI>Malte∣ses,</HI> and drive a smart trade; buying up prize goods: they carry them, and sell them at <HI>Scala∣nova,</HI> and other places in <HI>Asia,</HI> bringing for re∣turns cotton, which is here wrought into Dimi∣tys, and which are the best in all the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> great quantitys goe yearly to <HI>Candia, Zante,</HI> and other places. These Merchants also agree at <HI>Constantinople</HI> for the tribute of the whole Island. Most strangers are given to understand, the whole Island is enchaunted; such terrifying noi∣ses are somtimes heard, and the ships moorings to the shoare being often losed. A Dutch ship be∣ing in the <HI>Venetians</HI> service came to anchor in the Bay, making a harsor fast to one of the Rocks, and having understood how other Vessels were used to be served, the Master had two men a shoar to watch least any should cut his harsor.

Many such things the <HI>Venetian</HI> marriners give an account of, having had the Cables very often cut close to the ship. Which yet may be done in the night by a man swimming from the shoar.

<HEAD><HI>MILO,</HI> called formerly <HI>MELOS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Is a large Island, being between 80 and 90 miles in circumference.

The land is not very high, only to the South are two Mountains, which to those who come from <HI>Ceri∣go,</HI> seem like the tops of two Sugar loaves. It has a very faire Harbour, large, and secure against
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>all winds. Here Privateers do usually come to make up their Fleets, and it is most commonly their Rendezvous, at their first coming into the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> There is but one Town, which stands in a very fine plaine, being very well built with good stone. The <HI>Capuchins</HI> have a Church, and Convent; The Privateers continually bring them some presents, and most of the Islanders give them a great deal of Respect. The Greeks have several Monasteries, one of which stands on a Mountain to the South. From whence in a clear day the Island of <HI>Candia</HI> may be discern'd. The Privateers had made this place their chief Ren∣dezvous for several years, to almost the ruine of the Island; but of late have not so much frequent∣ed it. The women are equal in beauty with any in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and pretend to exceed others in breeding; most of them speaking <HI>Italian.</HI> The men are industrious, taking great pains to work their ground, it being worser soil here than in any of the Islands, occasioned from the Sulphurous na∣ture of it. Here are several hot places for men to sweat, at the side of Hills, which in some places are so hot, as to rost an Egg, if put between the hol∣low of some stones. All the whole Island is esteem∣ed to have fire under it, which is thought to consume the stones, which are very like to Honey∣combs, being all hollow. The Inhabitants are not above 5000.

<P>Which lyes in length N<SUP>o</SUP>. and S<SUP>o</SUP>. having ano∣ther Island to the East called <HI>Polina,</HI> tho most known by the name of <HI>Isola Bruciata,</HI> or <HI>burnt Island,</HI> between these Islands is a very good road for ships, and Gallys. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Armada did much frequent this place, it lying so convenient that they might go to Sea with any wind, in case an Enemy should come to attacque them; for they have a custom never to be in any Haven, or Port where they may be penn'd in; unless it be under some of their Castles, or in some of their own Islands. On both these Islands there is a continual watch (when the Armada is there) which make signs with smoak for every saile which they see; the ships which come from <HI>Turky,</HI> they will examine them. In the year 1664 I was a passenger aboard the little <HI>Hunter, Roger Hutson</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Master, bound from <HI>Smirna</HI> to <HI>Le∣gorne.</HI> We being off of the Island of <HI>Angentiero,</HI> a Felucca came to informe themselves of News from <HI>Turky,</HI> we acquainted them of what we knew and departed. But the wind changed Westerly, so our Master put back and he came to
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>anchor at the North of <HI>Millo</HI> at a place called <HI>Por∣to Polumbo,</HI> about 4 miles from the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet. So soon as we came to anchor, a boat came to command us to come to the General. The Ma∣ster was a stranger to these Seas, and did not care to venture out of his ship, but at last I perswaded him, and we went in our own Boat with two men. When we came to the Gally, the General order'd the Master and me to come into the Gally, keep∣ing us at a distance, till by our Pass-Port (or <HI>Pa∣tento</HI>) he saw the places, from whence we came, were free from contagious diseases; then order'd us to be carryed to the Secretary, to give an ac∣count of what we had heard at <HI>Smirna</HI> concerning the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces. When we had done there, we desired leave to fill some barrells of water, and get some other provision that we wanted. A man was order'd to go with us, to see that we paid no more than was the price; which was a great favour. When we returned, the General desired the Ma∣ster, that he would not saile without his Letters; which he promised should be ready next day be∣fore noon; the Master assured him he would stay; so we returned to our ship. About break of day the wind being fair at E<SUP>t</SUP>. and a fresh gale, our Ma∣ster was very impatient to be going, seeing also a ship coming from the Eastward. All the perswa∣sions I could use would not prevaile with him; but resolved he was to go, ordering his men to
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>bring Cable to Capstern, and heave. I told him what might be the ill consequence of breaking his promise with a General, and that he would soon send after us; but he depended upon the nimble∣ness of his Vessel, and question'd not but soon to be out of their reach. All things were in readiness, our anchor up, and we set saile. Soon did the wind abate, &amp; the Sentinells giving notice to the General that our ship had loosed saile, immediat∣ly two Gallys were dispatcht after us, they came soon up to us, and firing a Gun, the shot past betwixt our Mast. They commanded the Ma∣ster to come with his Boat to the General, bidding us drop anchor. To see in what a condition the Master was in, would have gain'd compassion in any one; he could not speak a word of <HI>Italian,</HI> (to discourse with) so begged of me to go with him. Indeed I did not desire to be seen in the business, not knowing what might befall us; but go I did. They towed our boat at a Gally Stern and we soon came to the Generals Gally. By the way we resolved on an Excuse, after rowling a great many, I proposed to the Master that our safest way was to acquaint the General, that our design was not to go to Sea; but that seeing a ship com∣ing from the Eastward we did not know what she might be; And we having Warr with <HI>Algier</HI> we were fearful, so weiged anchor to make a trip, and get under the Generals Stern. This thought
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>of mine pleased the Master, and we concluded to answer in this note, when we should be exa∣mined. When we came to the Generals Gally, we were order'd to come up; the General asked which was the Master; I shewed him the Ma∣ster, he order'd him to be put in chains at the Prow of the Gally, being in a very great pas∣sion, said that he would make an Example of him, and give an account of his base action to the <HI>English</HI> Consul at <HI>Venice.</HI> I let him breath out some of his passion, then spoke to the <HI>Com∣pagno di Standardo,</HI> desiring him to acquaint the General with the true manner of our intent, which he did. Upon which the General calls for me, bidding me speak the truth. I told him our design was not to saile without his Excellencies Letters, but that we purposed to come with our ship under his Protection, whereupon the Ma∣ster was brought off again, and we were well en∣tertained till the General's Letters were finish't, and next day the wind prov'd very fair, we set saile. At my coming to <HI>Legorne</HI> the Master gives an account of this to his Merchant, who order'd him to present me with my Passage. This I hint, that all who travel by Sea or Land may learn to be cautious, and not slight Governors. The Island of <HI>Argentiero</HI> hath but one small Town, whose Inhabitants are most Privateers.

A Prince in <HI>Athens</HI> had a Daughter, who was guilty of a great crime, for which she was condemn'd to be banished; and to make her the more despised, it was ordered, that the sleeves of her upper Gar∣ment should be cut off to her shoulders, with her smock sleeves hanging down to her hands, her Pettycoats cut short to her knees, with her smock at full length to her ancles, her hair hanging down behind. Being sent in this manner to this Island, the Inhabitants enquired who she was, and be∣ing told that she was a Princess, that came to bath in the waters for her healths sake, her dress pleased the common people, and now it continues their habit in most of the Islands, only their heads are better drest. They have their hair plated, in∣termixed with Ribbon, which is put round the hinder part of their heads, with a fine muzlin veil carelessly thrown over. Their bodys have no sleeves to them, but the better sort will have great wings hang down behind, richly embroi∣der'd. That which serves for a pettycoat comes to their knees being plaited very thick. I have seen one, which was but an ordinary one that had above 40 <HI>pikes</HI> of dimity, which is about 30 yards; some have above 60 pikes; and so weighty are their clothes which they wear, that

Their Smocks hang down to their ancles, but they are very narrow, with sleeves fastned at the wrist, and a loose sleeve over them, which comes over their hands, being broad. Their Stockings are most of red cloth, hanging in plaits; some with the clocks embroider'd. Their slippers are sol'd with cork, the upper part covered with red plush. The men have several sorts of habits; But the better sort have a long Vest, strait to their body, doubled over before, reaching down to their ancles, girt about the loins, and the sleeves button'd at the wrist; Over which is another Vest hanging loose, with broad sleeves of black cloth, resembling the <HI>Turks,</HI> to shew their supe∣riority over their brother Christians.

The same have I seen in <HI>Smyr∣na</HI> on Good Friday by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and also at <HI>Ga∣latta</HI> of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> The Vizier <HI>Cupri Ogle</HI> at his return from <HI>Candy,</HI> tarried here several days, and lodg'd in the house of one Signior <HI>Dominico Mascardi,</HI> which joyns to the <HI>Capucines</HI> Convent; one day asking what bell it was that he heard, one told him it <HI>was some bells of Mules;</HI> sayes the Vi∣zier to him that made that answer, <HI>and you are an Asse for endeavouring to make me believe so; This is some bell to call you to prayers and be not ashamed to enjoy the freedom which is given you.</HI> He was
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>several times in the garden, and commended their way of living. Before the Vizier came, order was given by the Elders to forbid the womens walking the Streets as their custom was, fearing least some souldiers should abuse them, and so occasion a dis∣order. The Vizier having been two or three days in town, and not finding the divertisement he expe∣cted from what he had been told, he asked what was the reason, it was told him that fearing some disturbance might be, orders were given to for∣bid the women to walk the streets. The Vizier made answer; <HI>That seeing they had such privi∣ledges, they should enjoy them while he was there, o∣therwise he would recall the Liberty they had.</HI> Next morning the streets were full with all sorts, and in the Evening by the Sea-side singing and danc∣ing most part of the nights. The <HI>Turks</HI> hold the <HI>Sciotes</HI> for a soft sort of People calling them, <HI>Pras∣sinos</HI> which signifies <HI>green:</HI> A <HI>Basha</HI> saying, <HI>it was as impossible to see a wise Sciote, as to see a green horse.</HI> All the time that the Vizier was here, there wàs not the least disorder amongst the Officers, but all were in <HI>dovere;</HI> and notwithstanding here were upwards of fifty thousand strangers in town and in the Fleet, the price of provision was not advanced. The Town lyes about 12 miles from the <HI>Asian</HI> shore almost opposite to a very strong Castle, called <HI>Chisme;</HI> From whence they are sup∣ply'd with most of their Provision; <HI>Scio</HI> not af∣fording
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>sufficient for the Inhabitants, and those passengers which are continually here. All Ves∣sels from <HI>Constantinople</HI> bound for the South usual∣ly call in here, both going and coming. There are above 30 Villages upon the Island, which are well inhabited most by <HI>Greeks;</HI> those who be∣long to the Mastick Villages, to the South-ward, have their hair long. The time for gathering the Mastick, is in <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September.</HI> The Custo∣mer goes out to the Villages, where they receive him with musick, and feasting. What Mastick is gathered, it is all delivered to the Customer, for the Grand Signiors use, and he soon dispatches it up to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to serve in the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> for se∣veral uses, What remains of the Grand Signiors store, the Customer sells to merchants. It is very dangerous for the Inhabitants, to keep any Ma∣stick by them. In <HI>Turky</HI> they use it to chew and some mixe it in their bread. The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Sackes,</HI> and the Island has the same name. The <HI>Italians</HI> call it <HI>Mastice,</HI> and <HI>Masticare</HI> is to chew. When any company of women meet in <HI>Turky,</HI> some Mastick is brought them on a server, and each taking a little, they are chew∣ing, and spitting most of the time. It is co∣mical to see the old women roale it about their gumms; the effects which they finde by it are, that it carrys away the flegme, cleanses and prevents the aking of the teeth; and causes a sweet breath.
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>Here is a continual watch kept round the Island; when they see any ships or other Vessels, in the day time they make a smoak, and in the night shew lights; the last Tower sends a man to ac∣quaint the Customer, what Vessels are on the Coast. If any passengers land in any part of the Island, the Sentinells accompany them to the Cu∣stomer, who inquires whence they came, and what business they have there; this is to pre∣vent spies. Betwixt this Island and the main are several small Islands called <HI>Spalmadori,</HI> which are much frequented with Privateers as those before <HI>Metelino;</HI> they lye about 12 miles to the North from the City. In the year 1666 a <HI>Malta</HI> ship Commanded by the <HI>Chevalier Tincourt</HI> was at anchor between those Islands, a fisher man passing by sees the ship; and coming to <HI>Scio</HI> finds the Captain <HI>Basha</HI> with about 40 Gallys. And going immediatly to him asked for <HI>Mustalook</HI> (a gift upon good tydings) for he had news to tell him. The <HI>Basha</HI> hearing the news order'd the boat-man to have 10 dollars, and put to Sea, it being very calm. The Sentinells from the Hills came down, and acquainted Monsieur <HI>Tincourt,</HI> that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet was rowing toward the Islands, so he with his boats towed the ship out to the East∣ward, before the Gallys came up to him, and had time to provide himself to receive them. A de∣sperate Fight was maintain'd for several hours,
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>and not a breath of wind stirring; so as the ship lay to their mercy, and was boarded by them se∣veral times, but were forc't off again leaving many men dead behind them. In the afternoon a fresh gale of wind began, at which those in the ship took courage, and Forc't the <HI>Basha</HI> to retire under the Guns of the Castles of <HI>Scio;</HI> Firing several broad sides into the Town. The Captain <HI>Basha</HI> sent to the <HI>Capucins</HI> to have them to go off in a Boat, and perswade the Captain to forbear firing into the Town. The <HI>Capucins</HI> went aboard, carrying some fresh provision as a present, desir∣ing <HI>Monsieur Tincourt</HI> to forbear, for that most da∣mage was to the poor Christians. So he retir'd, and went to <HI>Micone</HI> to repair his ship. He was a <HI>French</HI> man born, not above 24 years of age; he built and fitted out the ship at his own charge, stiling himself the <HI>Champion of Christ.</HI> His Father or Uncle dyed in sight against the <HI>Turks,</HI> while he was but a child, to revenge whose blood, he took this resolution; not above two months after, his ship was cast away on the Island of <HI>Scyros,</HI> where he perished; and of two hundred and fifty men not above 5 escaped, which caused a great grief to all who had heard of his Valour. He had not been in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> above two months, before he Fought with the <HI>Turkish</HI> fleet; and intended to have past the <HI>Dardanelli</HI> (as a merchant ship) so to do what mischief he could,
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>to the City of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by firing against it and then to make his escape out of the Castles or perish in the Action. I lived in <HI>Smyrna</HI> when this fight was, and had the particular relation from one of the <HI>Capucines.</HI> The profit which the <HI>Turks</HI> receive from <HI>Scio,</HI> is double what any other Island in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> payes; Nor are there any subjects in the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions, (of <HI>Greeks</HI>) that are richer. Their Habit is different from all other Islanders. The women have their Coats to their ancles, their bodys short and thick wasted, their head dress with Linnen close to their ears, raised up behind, (not unlike the Doge of <HI>Venice</HI> his Cornet) in which their hair is laid. They esteem great Leggs, and little Feet, some to be in the fashion will have 4 or more pair of stirrop Stockens. Before their breasts hangs a bibb which reaches a little below their wast, un∣der it they have their hands cover'd when they are abroad; when they dance a round dance they hold a pocket handkercheif in their hands, that they may not have their hands touch't. They have ear-rings, neck-laces, and braceletts of gold. The men wear strait body'd Jackets, with 4 broad skirts below the wast, strait kneed bree∣ches, to button, or tye at the knees, shoes and stockens most according to the <HI>Genoueses;</HI> they have a broad lappet of Linnen fastned to the neck-band of their shirts, which hangs down be∣hind
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>over their backs. Their hair is cut short to their Ears, and generally they wear little red capps or broad brim'd hatts. But their <HI>Vecchi∣ardi</HI> do wear long loose Garments over their Jackets and breeches.</P>

<P>Lyes to the North of <HI>Scio</HI> about 25 miles di∣stant. It is in compass about 70 miles, having no Harbour for great shipping, and therefore unca∣pable of any trade. The land is also very barren being most Mountainous, and rocky, so that they of <HI>Samos</HI> have a saying that when God made those Islands he order'd all the rubbish should be cast upon <HI>Icaria,</HI> which they have no great reason to say, for they have their share also of Moun∣tains. The Inhabitants are generally very poor, as the Privateers cannot get any thing out of them; nor can the <HI>Turks</HI> bring them to pay any considerable Tribute. They have some wine, but none of the best; it being hard: but here are the best Winter grapes which I did ever see, they being round and red, growing between the rocks and in such dangerous places to come at, as that with much hazard they are gather'd. Sheep they have some, but Goats are the cheif of their Food. I have seen several of the <HI>Nicariotes</HI> in their Boats that row all naked, for which they give two reasons; one that with their coats they can∣not
<PB N="54" REF="35"/>be so active at the oar, the other that they wear out their clothes much; for every time that they tugg the oar they rise with their bodys, and fall back on the banks as is usual in the Gally's.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SAMOS,</HI> by the Turks called <HI>SUSSAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Lyes about 12 miles to the East of <HI>Nicaria,</HI> and not above 3 from the maine of <HI>Natolia,</HI> being a large Island, and the Seat of an Arch-Bishop, tho' of so mean an Estate, as it will hardly suffice to give him bread, when he has satisfied what is due to the Patriarck of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> There is no good Harbour for ships, yet the Privateers ve∣ry often visit them, and carry away whatever they find. There is a <HI>Caddee Aga,</HI> and about twenty <HI>Turks</HI> more, who live upon the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Conti∣nual watch is kept, to give notice if any Priva∣teers do land, and then the <HI>Caddee</HI> and other <HI>Turks</HI> hide themselves up in the Mountains. But in the yeare 1676 <HI>Monsieur Crevillier</HI> landed a party of men, resolving to ruine the whole Island, he found out 4 of the <HI>Turks,</HI> whom he carried a∣way with what else they found. The Greeks of the Island were made to pay for the ransom of the <HI>Turks;</HI> and since that time the <HI>Turks</HI> do not venture to live amongst them unless it be some who are Servants to the Tribute Master, yet have these power to exercise Lordship over the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and will not abate of the respect which
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>is due to their Master. In matters of Justice, when the <HI>Caddee</HI> is not here, the <HI>Vecchiardi</HI> (El∣ders of the <HI>Greeks</HI>) do judge and determine Cau∣ses; but must be sure to take the Rights of the <HI>Cad∣dee,</HI> which are sent him to <HI>Scala nova,</HI> and then he puts his seal to the Award of the <HI>Vecchiardi.</HI> In every Village there is one called the <HI>Proto,</HI> or Chief, who oversees and gathers in the Tenths of their Crop, giving an exact account to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and to ingratiate himself with them, he will be as severe with his fellow Christians, as the <HI>Turks</HI> can be. Notwithstanding the Moun∣tains, which are many here, there is land enough to be manured to imploy 10000 men, which with good management, would be in few years little inferiour to <HI>Scio.</HI> There is nothing that can be planted, but the ground doth bring forth. Vines are generally more natural to this soile, than to any of the neighbouring Islands, and the wines more pleasant, but for want of conveni∣ence to sell them, they plant no more than to suffice their own occasions. Here, and at <HI>Tene∣dos,</HI> is the best Muscadine (next to that of <HI>Lu∣xuri</HI> on <HI>Cefalonia,</HI>) that ever I drank. This they carry to <HI>Scio, Smyrna,</HI> and several other parts, which with Oynions, Garlik, and some earthen Ware is the chief of their Adventures abroad. The <HI>Venetians</HI> forced them formerly to pay year∣ly 20000 dollars, but a great part of this was in
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>Corne, Wine and Cattle, at a certain price; this was when they were better to pass than now, for then the Privateers durst not molest them. They were forc't (upon the peace made betwixt the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI> &amp; <HI>Turks</HI>) to pay their arrears to the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

There are several small Villages and Monasterys. Upon this Island did S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>John</HI> the Divine write the Revelations (a Ma∣nuscript of which they have) and here, if we may believe the Inhabitants, is to be seen the Pulpit in which he preach't, and the Font where he used to Baptize.

But the Grand Signors revenues must be yearly paid, which amounts to above 30000 dollars, that is, pole mony, and tenths, which is easy to what was pretended.

<HEAD>IPSARA.</HEAD>
<P>Is a small Island which lyes to the West of <HI>Scio,</HI> very poorely inhabited. It hath a safe Port. Its West side secured with a small Island lying be∣fore it. At the entrance from the North there
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>runs a ridg of rocks from the great Island almost halfe a mile into the Sea, being about 16 Foot under water. Upon these Rocks the ship <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> stuck fast, having aboard her the R<SUP>t</SUP>. Hono∣rable the Earl of <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> a true relation of which follows. In the year 1660 his Lordship imbarqued on the <HI>Plymouth,</HI> on an Embassy from His Majesty of Great <HI>Brittain</HI> to the Grand <HI>Sig∣nior,</HI> and about the end of <HI>December</HI> arrived at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where his Lordship tarryed till <HI>January</HI> the 6. When he imbarqued again for his Voyage to <HI>Canstantinople.</HI> So soon as his Lordship was aboard they set saile, with the wind at East, sail∣ing towards the Castle, which is about three Leagues from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> it fell calme; then they came to anchor, and tarryed all night, having in their company the ship Smyrna-Factor, and a Ketch, the latter waited upon the man of Warr. Next morning being the 7<SUP>th</SUP> the wind at S E<SUP>t</SUP> 'twas a fine gale, they weighed anchor, the weather promising them a speedy passage, but the wind veering to the N E<SUP>t</SUP> with a strong gale, they wea∣thered <HI>Caraborun</HI> standing for the Island of <HI>Mete∣lino;</HI> intending to spend the night under the Lee of that Island in smooth water, bringing their ship under a Maine-Course. All that night the wind increased every hour more and more, so that in the morning it was a most violent Storme, the Sea in a breach, the sky very black and thick,
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>and the Sun lowring and red, which were the undoubted Indications of its continuance. The Spray of the Sea was so forcibly carried by the wind over the ship, that the Masts, yards and Decks were querned with the white salt. This extremity of weather made them think of some Port, to secure themselves. The Island of <HI>Ipsara</HI> lying about 8 Leagues distant S by W<SUP>t</SUP> from <HI>Me∣telino,</HI> it was supposed by the Master a safe place with this wind to spend the fury of the Storm in; so they put her before it, with fore-saile down, and main-saile in the brailes; but the wind soon blew away their fore-saile like paper, and in bringing another to the yard, it had the misfor∣tune to be foule of the flook of the anchor, and soon became as unserviceable as the other. Be∣ing thus deprived of their commanding sailes, they loosed their sprit-saile and set their maine∣course. Steering in between the greater and les∣ser Islands, the ship had swift way being shott within the Northermost point, and luffing too near the great Island, on a suddain she stuck fast on a Rock, which astonished them with a strange amazement; the poor ship knocked five several times to cleare her self from a total Wrack and ruine. They all began to despaire of her, and with cast up eyes and stretched out armes thought now of no other but their last and final Port. But in the midst of this horrid con∣sternation
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>and distress it pleased God, who was their best Pilot, to bring the ship off, and to all their appearances without the least damage: an escape so wonderful and miraculous (on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> day of <HI>January</HI>) as it ought to be ever recorded to Admiration by all that were partakers in the danger, and an Anniversary thanksgiving be made to God for his Providence over and Prote∣ction of them. When they were in this distress, they fired a Gun to give warning to the <HI>Smyrna</HI>-Factor, and Ketch, who thereupon stood away for <HI>Milo.</HI> The storme continued all that day, so that with two anchors down (the sheat anchor being one) they had much ado to secure the ship fast, the Storm continuing so very violent. The 10<SUP>th</SUP> the wind abated, and the 14<SUP>th</SUP> it veered a∣bout to the S W<SUP>t</SUP>, so they sailed towards the <HI>Dar∣danelle,</HI> the 15<SUP>th</SUP> they got to <HI>Tenedos</HI> about 8 in the morning, and about 3 in the afternoon, entred the old Castles. From the new Castles a boat came off, in which was a messenger to acquaint his Lordship, that the Vizier had sent orders that free passage should be granted his Lordship, and his attendance with the ship, without any hin∣drance or molestation. From the old Castles came off a Boat in which were some Janizaries &amp; Drug∣germen (or Inter preters) belonging to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Tho. Bendish,</HI> that brought letters to his Lordship. On the 17<SUP>th</SUP> (it being 3 Months since his Lord∣ship
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>imbarqued in <HI>England</HI>) they came to anchor neare the 7 Towers, till such time as S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Tho. Bendish</HI> had notice: then weighed anchor, and stood for the Port. Some time before a <HI>Bostangee,</HI> one belonging to the Grand Signiors Garden, came aboard, pretending to be sent from the <HI>Bostangee Basha</HI> to know what ship it was of so great Equipage, and Burthen, also telling them that the Grand Signior was seated on the corner of the wall of the <HI>Serraglio.</HI> With a fresh gale of wind they had all their colours abroad, with all their Guns, and wastclothes out. Being al∣most opposit to the <HI>Serraglio</HI> Point, the said <HI>Bu∣stangee</HI> went aboard again, telling them that it was the Grand Signors pleasure that they should rejoyce with Guns, (which was his expression) upon which they fired six Guns and came to an anchor at <HI>Toppanna,</HI> when S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Tho. Bendish</HI> came aboard to congratulate his Lordships arrival, his Lordship the next day (being the 18<SUP>th</SUP>) was re∣ceived ashore, and indeed with that great state and handsom Equipage, that no Ambassador from <HI>England, France,</HI> or <HI>Germany</HI> ever passed in with more honour or wonder of the Multitude. Where we will leave his Lordship and come back with the ship which tarryed some time at <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> and in her return called in at <HI>Messina, Le∣gorne,</HI> and several Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> having under∣gone many stormes at Sea, and at last arrived in
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>safety in the River of Thames. At <HI>Wollwich</HI> she was hall'd into the dry Dock, and being search∣ed, there was found a great piece of a rock in the bottom of her, so fast in, that it could not but with much difficultie be got out. It passed the keel of the ship, and was so close fixed in, that it stopt the water from coming in. This piece of Rock was carried to his Majestys Closet at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where it is carefully preserved.</P>

The Castles stand opposite to each other, having above 100 Guns in each, most of which lye level with the water, so as it is almost impossible any ship should pass upward, without leave. The Gunners there are expert Marksmen; I have seen tryall made of their skill. In the year 1670 the <HI>Captain Basha</HI> was there, when an empty Butt was cast into the Sea about a mile above the Castles which the Stream brought down, and it being come between them, in two shott it was sunk. When the <HI>Basha</HI> departed he was saluted with two shott, one past just at the Prow, the other un∣der the Poop of his Gally, so near as the water spry'd into the Gally. Here is a continual tyde or current which runs downwards, to the South so strong as a Gally can hardly with a full stroak gain way against it, nor was it ever known that the Stream did run upwards. In the year 1665 I was a passenger in the <HI>Sampson</HI> (Captain <HI>Samuel Chamblet</HI> Commander) from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> the winds being contrary we lay at anchor without the new Castles from <HI>May</HI> till the be∣ginning of <HI>August,</HI> for here in the Summer time the winds are most Northerly. Our chief Mate M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Frith,</HI> was a very great Artist, and often would make tryalls about the current which runs down∣wards;
<PB N="67" REF="41"/>he found that some times the water re∣turned upward about 3 fathom deep, when at the same time it run swift downwards above. This experiment he tryed several times, with one and the same effect. Past the <HI>Hellespont</HI> the Island of <HI>Marmora</HI> shews it self, being but small; it has its name from the quantity of Marble which is there. Several Slaves are employ'd to cut it out, and some old Gallys transport it to <HI>Constan∣tinople</HI> for the building those stately <HI>Mosques, Bag∣nos,</HI> and Palaces wherein it now flourishes. A∣gainst the Gulph of <HI>Montania</HI> is the Island of <HI>Papa</HI> not inhabited. About 16 miles from <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI> are 7 Islands which some call the Islands of <HI>Princepe,</HI> tho' one only hath that name which is the largest; to it the <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperors did use to banish their Sons, if guilty of any great fault, now only one is inhabited, called <HI>Chalcis</HI> which is to the N<SUP>o</SUP>. of <HI>Princepe,</HI> there being a small Village and two Monasterys in it. Being so near to <HI>Constantinople</HI> I must give the Reader a short view of it. The scituation for pleasantness, and conveniencie, and the Port for largness and se∣curity may sue for preeminence above all others. The River between <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Galata,</HI> is not broader then the Thames at London-bridge, but hath much deeper water, so that no bridg can be made over. The largest ships may have their heads ashore, and 18 fathom water at
<PB N="68" REF="42"/>their stern. The Arsenal next to that at <HI>Venice</HI> is the best in <HI>Europe.</HI> The broadest street in <HI>Constantinople</HI> is not so broad as Lumbard street. Very few houses (if any) are above three stories high, they are built most with timber. Their shops &amp; warehouses are most by the water side, to which all people flock in the day time, which makes it seem to be so populous. The <HI>Grand Signor</HI>'s <HI>Serraglio</HI> is seated on the most East point of the City having a prospect up into the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> 'tis surrounded with a high wall near two miles round, having upwards of 400 large Cypress trees regularly planted in it, with many fair Summer∣houses without the wall close to the Sea side. The <HI>Turks</HI> call this City <HI>Stamboll,</HI> to signify, that it is abounding in all things; and indeed it is the best supplyed with Flesh, Fish, Fowl, Fruit and Corn of any great City in <HI>Europe.</HI> Many having given a large account of it already, I will forbear enlarging thereon. In the year 1665 a <HI>Quaker</HI> who lived in <HI>Dover,</HI> was perswaded to come to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to convert the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> those who set him on the design, perswading him, that he should have the gift of Tongues: but he was disappointed in that, and all other his ex∣pectations, and without seeing the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI> or <HI>Vizier,</HI> by the Right Honorable the Earl of <HI>Winchelsea</HI>'s order, was shipt aboard the ship <HI>Sun,</HI> and sent for <HI>Legorn.</HI> I have since seen

<HEAD>The present State of that famous Island and Kingdom of <HI>CANDIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Island of <HI>Candia,</HI> which in old time (and now by the <HI>Turks</HI>) is called <HI>Crete,</HI> hath followed the other parts of the Empire of <HI>Greece,</HI> and is now subjected to the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> after a Warr for above 27 years. In which time the <HI>Venetians</HI> (tho' in comparrison, as a flea in the beard of a Lyon, to the Ottoman Forces) did bravely, and with an unparallel'd Courage, defend the City of <HI>Candia</HI> to the last ex∣tremity. After a close Siege for near 2 years continuance, the Vizier there in person, and with him the best of all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, they were forced to surrender, yet upon the most honorable termes, that they themselves could propose; car∣rying away with them not only their Cannon, and all other amunition, but also the bells, which were in the Steeples, and whatever else they thought worth the Labour. The Vizier was so over-joyed, that the City was surrender'd to him, that he appointed several of the <HI>Turkish</HI> boats, to assist the <HI>Venetians,</HI> if they should have occasion of their help in carrying their goods to the ships. He was so observing of his word in the Peace.
<PB N="70" REF="46"/>that he caused two <HI>Janizarys</HI> to be put to death for attempting to force their way into the City. All <HI>Europe</HI> has heard of this great Seige, how many thousand Bombs were cast into the City; How many Mines, and Fornellos were blown up; and how many bold assaults the <HI>Turks</HI> made. They had at last workt themselves so near the Walls that it was impossible for the besieged to make use of any of their great Guns. For no sooner could a man appear to level a Gun, but there was a shower of bullets and arrows, so that the <HI>Turks</HI> would often attempt to under∣mine the Walls, and the <HI>Venetians</HI> did counter∣mine them, and when they met under ground, they fought most desperately. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have an Engine which they call <HI>trombo di fuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> it is as long as a half Pike, the Staff bigger: At the end are two Irons, about two Foot long, in the form of a fork; In which is fastned a trunk made of Iron, (and some are of wood) in it are five charges, each firing severally at a certain time, and carry several bullets to do execution as far as a Pistol. They set fire to it at the fore part, and have a touch, to reach from one chamber to the other. Another Invention they had to fish up the <HI>Turks,</HI> when they attempted to under∣mine their Walls. They had hooks made in the forme of a boats grapling, the points sharp, fastn'd to a rope and 4 or 5 foot of chain at the end;
<PB N="71" REF="46"/>These hooks they often cast over the Walls, a∣mongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> and seldom failed to bring up a <HI>Turke,</HI> some fastned by the clothes, o∣thers by the body. I have heard some of the officers say, they have taken several in a night. For when the hook was fastned, they gave them not time to unhook themselves but had them soon over the Walls, and many a <HI>Turk</HI> have the common soldiers eaten. At the <HI>Greeks</HI> leaving <HI>Candia</HI> there happned a most sad accident; a new ship called <HI>La Fregatta Galliera,</HI> or the Gally Frigot, was pitcht upon for transporting most of the Principal of the Gentry, and the greatest part of the riches of the Citizens; there was also (besides what were mounted) 50 great brass Guns, the Passengers were between 250 and 300 besides 200 Mariners and upward. Being between a little Island called <HI>Ovo,</HI> and the Port of <HI>Cerigo,</HI> the ship open'd, and not a man was saved. The rest of the Fleet got well, some to <HI>Zante,</HI> others to <HI>Ceffalonia, Corfu</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> landing the <HI>Greeks</HI> as they had a fancy to the place which they came to, or as they found freinds. Thus they left their Estates to the Ene∣my, and not above 5 or 6 <HI>Greeks</HI> remained, who being in years, and sickly withal, desir'd leave of the General, that they might tarry, and end their days there. In the Articles of peace it was concluded, that the <HI>Venetians</HI> should keep pos∣session
<PB N="72" REF="47"/>of three small Islets which are close to the Island of <HI>Candia,</HI> and have each a very strong Castle. The <HI>Turks</HI> did laugh at their proposals, saying we have the Henn, and the Chicken will follow of course, of these Isletts you shall have a further account hereafter. This Island had 20 Citys, and above 1000 Towns, Villages and large Monasterys, now there is not above 4 Citys, and 300 Towns and Villages. To give you an account of them I will begin with the eastern part. This was formerly a Province called <HI>Sittia;</HI> the head City had the same name, standing in a Bay, at the North East part of the Island, at the West side extending from the North, to the bot∣tom of the Bay Southerly, above a mile in length. The Castle stood on a rising ground to the N W<SUP>t</SUP>. of the Town, built of a course Marble stone. The <HI>Venetians</HI> finding the place was not Tenable, caused several mines to be made, by which they destroy'd the Castle and Town, and so went to <HI>Candia.</HI> By the ruins it may be seen the builders had no thoughts, so soon to have left them; most of the Walls are intire and some have lower rooms with beams, which are patcht up, and serve for store houses to put corn in, when any ship comes to lade. In the year 1680 I was here and load∣ed a <HI>Sattee</HI> of <HI>Provence</HI> Captain <HI>Iseppe Bremon</HI> who belonged to <HI>Cassis</HI> about 10 miles from <HI>Marsellis.</HI> The Wheat was the <HI>Basha</HI>'s own, which he sold
<PB N="73" REF="47"/>at 3 <HI>Timins</HI> a <HI>Killoe,</HI> (i. e. about <HI>14<SUP>d</SUP>.</HI> the Bushel.) The <HI>Turk</HI> who came with me from <HI>Candia,</HI> was an ordinary Servant. But as we travelled the Road, and when we came hither he would do∣mineer at a strange rate. Here are no Inhabi∣tants nearer then 12 miles, at a small Village cal∣led <HI>Alona,</HI> saving at a small house and Chappel, which is a <HI>Metoiki</HI> (or Chappel of ease to a Mona∣stery up in the Mountains) about a quarter of a mile from the Sea. Amongst others the <HI>Greek</HI> Priests brought their tenths, to the <HI>Turks.</HI> They all desire to have a Seaman to measure their Corn rather then the <HI>Turks;</HI> for they will stir the corn about with their hands, and press it down; But the Master was content to take it with a just measure, and Favoured the poor <HI>Greeks</HI> what he could. At <HI>Alona</HI> resides the <HI>Basha</HI>'s Lieutenant, who has 100 <HI>Spahees</HI> to guard the Coast from Pri∣vateers; but more to gather in the tenths. The <HI>Greeks</HI> maintaine them, at their own charge. To the Eastward of <HI>Sittia</HI> on a point of land, is a Monastery dedicated to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Isidoro</HI> to which be∣longs a great Revenue, it maintains about 40 <HI>Calo∣jeros.</HI> There are several rich Lamps, and other ornaments of Silver and Gold. Here they shew you the Picture of the Blessed Virgin, which (they say) was brought by Angels from <HI>Stancoi,</HI> and was found in a cave of that Mountain. They have Lands on the Island of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> where they
<PB N="74" REF="48"/>have a <HI>Metoiki</HI> and several <HI>Calojeroes,</HI> to gather in the cropps of corne, oyl and wine; the <HI>Turks</HI> allowing them to enjoy it, calling it <HI>Vacofa,</HI> or possessions for Gods use, yet they will receive their tenths from it. The <HI>Gomina</HI> or Overseer of this Monastery had made his Escape, taking with him above two thousand pieces of Eight, in ready mony and plate, but being pursued, he was taken at <HI>Scarpante</HI> an Island lying in the midd way, between <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI> &amp; by the <HI>Basha</HI>'s order put to death. To the South of <HI>A∣lona</HI> about 10 miles is a very high Mountain cal∣led by the <HI>Turks Basha Dogg,</HI> from it may be seen the Sea, to East, West, North and South. Here are the Ruins of a Castle called formerly <HI>Barozza,</HI> 'twas built by a Gentleman of that name. It is, square, about 60 Foot high, with a tarrazzo, and battlements on the top, each square is a∣bout 40 foot. The Wall is very thick; the door about 10 foot from the ground, having a dry ditch about it. Of these there are several about the Island, as the old built Castles are in <HI>Ireland.</HI> For formerly the <HI>Candiotes,</HI> did use to Warr a∣mongst themselves, but now all such quarrells are ended by their subjection to a common Master. The City of <HI>Girapetra</HI> is to the South of the Island, having no secure Port, but an open Road, where Vessels in the Summer time may be with security from the Weather, but not from Priva∣teers;
<PB N="75" REF="48"/>for while I was there, they carryed away a Saike which came from <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Town is wall'd round, and hath a small Castle which lyes higher then the Town. Here is continually a Garrison of 200 <HI>Janizaries,</HI> besides there are several <HI>Turks,</HI> who are Merchants, so that in all they can raise 500 fighting men. There is about it a very fine plain full of Olive trees and some pleasant Gardens. Their houses are well built, of good stone, the rooms very lofty; but few houses above two storie high. In the year 1675, one <HI>Monsieur Crevellier,</HI> a famous Privateer, land∣ed 500 men in the Bay of <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> travelling in the night, he came next morning, just at the dawning of the day, and found the <HI>Turks</HI> at their <HI>Sabbah namas</HI> morning prayer, so he made himself master of the Town, carryed away 200 slaves, nail∣ing up the Guns which were in the Castle. The <HI>Turks</HI> which were at the South part of the Town, betook themselves to some small Vessels, for they had not the heart to return home, to fetch their armes. Monsieur <HI>Crevellier</HI> to retreat with this great prize, resolved to kill what horses he found, securing twenty for himself, &amp; officers, to ride at the reare; This enter prize was effected in less then six hours after they enter'd the Town, for they did not tarry to ransack the houses much. After they were departed, about 300 men, <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> were got together, and marched a
<PB N="76" REF="49"/>mile or two out of town, and had not <HI>Crevellier</HI> kill'd the horses, he could never have got out of the Island. It is very strange that so many men could come with that secresy as not to be disco∣vered, and that the hearts of those <HI>Turks</HI> should be so dull'd. Immediatly they dispatch't expres∣ses to the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> Writing to the <HI>Basha</HI> that above 1500 Christians had landed, and car∣ryed away 200 Prisoners, most of them men of the Garrison; the <HI>Basha</HI> asked the messenger, if the rest of the Inhabitants were a sleep, or dead; <HI>No says the messenger, but their hearts were, be∣ing all surprized, some in their Mosques, and some in the Coffee houses, and not a man, that had his senses. Most of the horses being also kill'd.</HI> The <HI>Basha</HI> asked him how he escaped, he ans∣wered, <HI>that he had the wit to hide himself, as a great many others did.</HI> There were three Gal∣lys in the Mole at <HI>Candia,</HI> under the command of one <HI>Babba Hassan,</HI> who were sent out to look after <HI>Crevellier,</HI> but to no purpose, for they re∣turned without seeing him. Since, there is an order that the Gates shall be shut an hour before Sunn set, and not opened till an hour after morn∣ing prayers, and now there are several guards on the Mountains, besides the <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Candia,</HI> has threatned, the Providitore at <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> to complain to <HI>Venice</HI> if he suffer any Privateers to come into that Bay; so as for some years they
<PB N="77" REF="49"/>have attempted nothing. The Country towards the South is not so mountanous as to the North, and Northwest parts; having several large and pleasant plaines, which have many ruins of fine town's. To the East of <HI>Girapetra</HI> about 10 miles I went to see a Cave under the Mountain of <HI>Iro</HI> as they now call it, where they say S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Paul</HI> preached: it is a large Chappel having 12 pillars all cut out of the Rock, which was done by the Christians in the night time. Some say it was finished in less then a months time. Close by is a Fountain where they say he used to Baptize, and it is now called S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Pauls</HI> Fountain, the water thereof is very good, to cure such as have sore eyes. From <HI>Gierapetra</HI> to <HI>Bonifacia</HI> is 14 hours riding most in plains, very delightsome, there being very high Mountains to the North, with most pleasant valleys between, and abundance of <HI>Cyprus</HI> trees. <HI>Bonifacia</HI> stands on a rising ground, having only the Walls of a Castle. The Inhabitants are most <HI>Greeks,</HI> very poor; here is a Metropolitan who pretends to be next to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Candia.</HI> There are two <HI>Italian</HI> Churches; the dores are made up with Walls to keep Cattle from going in. The <HI>Greeks</HI> have four small Churches, but one will contain more then all the Inhabitants. They have now new named the place calling it <HI>Mala∣facia</HI> instead of <HI>Bonifaci</HI> (good Face) it being so much alter'd from what it was in former time.
<PB N="78" REF="50"/>From <HI>Bonifacia</HI> to the <HI>Labarinth</HI> is about 10 miles, or three hours riding W<SUP>t</SUP>, most a plain. Several men have several opinions about this building, (if I may call it so.) But one Signior <HI>Venetando,</HI> who was born in a neighbouring Village, gives this account, that a certain King of this Island, had so great a hatred for all women, that he order'd this place for his Court, and at last lived so pri∣vate that he would not suffer any to come to him but such as ruled in his stead. He would sel∣dome come out but to worship at a Temple de∣dicated to Jupiter, which stood close by it. In this <HI>Labarinth</HI> he ended his days, and had a fa∣mous Tombe built for him, the ruins of which they shew you. The <HI>Labarinth</HI> is above two miles about, being so covered on the top with earth, as it seems to be all of firm land; we entred it with two torches, and candles in Lanthornes, having a line to direct us out again. The way is plain under foot, and archt over head, some ar∣ches being about 10 foot high, some more, some less, with several windings. I made it my busi∣ness to observe if there was any thing of a build∣ing, in the pillars or sides, but found it most an entire stone, which they told me, so cemented together that indeed it appeared so. Here are a great many small places about 4 foot long, 2 broad, and 2 over, which were for burying pla∣ces. There are abundance of batts, which hang
<PB N="79" REF="50"/>in clusters, some are larger than ordinary. We endeavoured to fright them scorching their wings, by which we found there was life in them; their sleep is observ'd to be much more sound with a N<SUP>o</SUP>. wind, than with a S<SUP>o</SUP>. wind, as the spring comes on, they leave their palace. We had almost end∣ed our line, being about 100 pikes, which is above 80 yards, and then returned out, being a good hour in the <HI>Labarinth.</HI> The damps are very great; against rain it is always dropping, but very dry with Northerly winds. At the end is a lake, and they tell you, that some have attempted to go to it, and have been drawn into it. Our cu∣riosity did not invite us to see it, for were it not true, as in probability 'tis not, the noisom smells are enough to stifle one. To the South and close by, is a small Village with two Churches, which seem to have been Temples. To the S W<SUP>t</SUP>, about 10 miles distant, is that famous and great Moun∣tain called <HI>Psillo Vuona,</HI> formerly Mount <HI>Ida;</HI> at 4 of the Clock it casts a shadow on the <HI>Labarinth,</HI> on it are many pleasant Monasteries with Groves of Cypress trees, and abundance of Fountains. Some say the Coast of <HI>Barbary</HI> may be seen from the top. From the <HI>Labarinth</HI> to <HI>Candia</HI> is about 10 hours riding, most in a plain, till within 10 miles of the City. At the right hand, about a mile from the road, is a most stately Monastery, dedi∣cated to our blessed Saviour, which was built by
<PB N="80" REF="51"/>order of the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great. It hath always been continued to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and kept its splendor, till the late Warr, when it was much defaced. There are abundance of Mona∣sterys, but very poor, and some are shut up for want of Priests.</P>
<P><HI>Candia Novo</HI> is about 6 miles from the City of <HI>Candia</HI> Southward, being a strong Castle, having <HI>Mount Jove</HI> to the West. Here the <HI>Turks</HI> kept their Treasure and Ammunition, in the Siege of <HI>Candia.</HI> It is seated very pleasantly on a rising ground, giving a prospect to the Sea. It is now chiefly inhabited by <HI>Greeks;</HI> the Castle has a Garrison of <HI>Turks,</HI> which the <HI>Basha</HI> intended to bring to <HI>Candia,</HI> and demolish the Castle, hav∣ing writ to the Port about it; but he had no an∣swer. <HI>Candia,</HI> so famous, and generally known for the brave defence it made against the <HI>Turk,</HI> appears by the ruins to have been one of the best built Citys in the midd-land Seas. It is seated on the North side of the Island, almost midd-way between <HI>Canea</HI> and <HI>Sittia,</HI> in a pleasant Bay, hav∣ing an artificial Port, secured from the N<SUP>o</SUP> wind by a Mole about 200 yards long, with a strong and large Castle at the head, called <HI>Castel del Mo∣lo</HI> having 20 great Guns. From the South is a low point of land, which runs into the Sea N<SUP>o</SUP>. which secures it from the Easterly wind's, and makes the entrance not above 30 yards wide;
<PB N="81" REF="51"/>upon this point of land the <HI>Turks</HI> have built a co∣ver'd way, with a very thick wall, full of holes, for small shot, strongly arch't over, reaching from the Arsenal to the entrance into the Port, where is a small Fort with 4 great Guns, also ve∣ry strongly arch't over, so as no Bomb can offend it. At the right hand, at coming out of the Gate to the Mole, is a new Fort built with 4 very great Guns, which lye level with the water, over them are 8 smaller Guns. This Fort is opposite to the mouth of the Port, and is arch't over to prevent danger from Bombs, or wild fire. On the Mole, are several great Guns planted with arches over them. To the East of the Arsenal, is the old Castle called <HI>La Battaria del Arsenal,</HI> which is rebuilt, with a ditch round it, to bring in the Sea, most cut out of a firm Rock. The Port is almost round, and secure against any wind, for Gallys and smaller Vessels, but there is not wa∣ter enough for ships of any considerable bigness. It is fill'd very much with the rubbish, that the rains carryed into it, from the City, and would certainly have been choakt up in a few years, had it not been for a <HI>French</HI> Merchant, one <HI>Monsieur Dudei,</HI> who, to ingratiate himself with the <HI>Basha,</HI> caused an Engine to be brought from <HI>Marselle</HI> to cleanse it. There are the ruins of 12 Arches of the Arsenal, and about 6 Arches are yet en∣tire, but they use them only to work in when the
<PB N="82" REF="52"/>Gallys are there: No Gallys having been built here. The City is not repair'd towards the land, where the Walls are so much shaken, that it will require a great deal of time and cost to fortify them. From the Port towards the West, upon the Wall are 50 large Guns planted. The Fort of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Andrea</HI> at the N. W<SUP>t</SUP>. of the City is well re∣paired, having a double wall towards the Sea. In all there are about 400 Guns planted on the Walls, and out-works, which are 6 miles in circumference. The Gates of <HI>Candia</HI> are the best I ever saw, the Arch or Gate-house being about 100 yards long, and the Gates 10 broad, the Arch is all built of firm stone. It will take up three hours to walk round the out-works. There are several mines which were never blown up; Every mine had a distinct name, I was in one mine which was above a mile in length, being about 6 foot high and three broad. All the plain for above two miles without the Walls is like a new plow'd field, where you cannot walk, but must see pieces of dead mens bones. None are permitted to walk round the works, but such as have a Licence and a <HI>Janizary</HI> with them. The <HI>Turks</HI> take a delight to give an account of the strength of the place, and especially will shew you a small Cave or arch, where the <HI>Venetian</HI> Gene∣ral did use to sleep (as they tell you) to secure himself from the Bombs. Not above one eighth
<PB N="83" REF="52"/>part of the houses, that formerly were, are now inhabited, very few being left entire, nor do the <HI>Turks</HI> repair any but those where they dwell; the chief Mosque is well repair'd, it was formerly a Church dedicated to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Mark,</HI> and stands to the E<SUP>t</SUP> of the great <HI>Piazza;</HI> to the South of it are part of the Walls of old <HI>Candia,</HI> close to which are built up a row of houses, two storie high for the Janizaries. The <HI>Basha</HI>'s Pallace is a little below the great Mosque on the other side of the way; opposite to it is the great Hall, formerly called <HI>La Sala di Consiglio,</HI> which is a very stately building of white Marble, with several works in <HI>Basso Relievo;</HI> to the S E<SUP>t</SUP>. of it stands the Church of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Francisco</HI> with an entire Cloyster, which is a Mosque. The street from the Mole to the chief <HI>Piazza</HI> is in good repair, being broad and pav'd with an even stone; the houses are also well inha∣bited. But that part towards the W<SUP>t</SUP>. is a heap of ruins, amongst which live the <HI>Jews,</HI> who have very large houses, but some of their upper rooms have no other shelter from the weather, but a few matts made fast upon poles. The beams of the old houses are bought up, and carryed to <HI>Ve∣nice, Zante,</HI> and other places; and being made of Cyprus wood they serve to make chests and cabinets, many of which have been brought to <HI>England.</HI> The number of the Inhabitants of the City is not reckoned to be above 10000 with
<PB N="84" REF="53"/><HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> There is a continual Garrison of 2000 Janizaries besides the <HI>Basha</HI>'s guardes. Since the taking the place, they have granted liberty to all, who will come to inhabit there, but all their in∣couragement cannot bring the <HI>Candiotes</HI> to dwell there. Formerly the Plain was full of Olive trees, with delightsom pleasure-houses and gardens. Now nothing but ruins are to be seen. The City stands on a rising ground from the Sea. The houses were so built with tarrazzis, as most from the tops could have a sight of the Sea. From <HI>Candia</HI> to <HI>Rettimo</HI> is about 12 hours riding. The City stands on a point of land very pleasantly, having a Port to the East, which is almost choakt up, so as no Gally can get over the barr being laden, but <HI>Brigantines</HI> and smaller Vessels are very secure against all winds. Towards the Sea are no Walls, the Rocks there fortifying the place, so as an Enemy can only come by land. This place was the first the <HI>Turks</HI> made themselves Masters of, putting all to the Sword, to give the greater terror to the rest of the Island. Since they possest it, they have built three new Forts, towards the Sea, and a wall with a dry Ditch to landward. It is now chiefly inhabited by <HI>Turks,</HI> who trade to <HI>Constantinople</HI> considerably. The houses are here intire according to the <HI>Venetian</HI> manner of building. There are some <HI>Greeks</HI> that dwel in the City; but they have a small town a∣bout
<PB N="85" REF="53"/>a quarter of a mile off, where are 2 Churches, where they have free exercise of their Religion. The Country hereabout is very pleasant, full of Olive trees, and from the Sea side, the land rises easily to the foot of the Mountains of <HI>Sfacia,</HI> a∣bout 8 miles from the City, which from the Sea seems to be all a wood, from which Mountains run several pleasant streames, and one very large river called Platonico, which is continually full, being supplyed from above a thousand Fountains, which the Mountains produce. These Moun∣tains of <HI>Sfacia</HI> are abounding in all things neces∣sary for life, and nothing can be more delight∣som in the Summer time. They reach near 30 miles towards the S W<SUP>t</SUP>. in length, and in some places about 10 in breadth, coming down close to the Bay of <HI>Suda.</HI> The Cheese which is made here, is bought up by the <HI>Venetians</HI> and other Mer∣chants, and transported to <HI>France, Italy, Zante,</HI> &amp;c. It is the best Cheese that is made in any of the Southern parts, and generally as good as our <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheeses, being made as bigg. Besides which they have great store of Honey, Wax, Silk, Wool, Cordovan-Leather, and a sort of goats Hair, little inferior to that of <HI>Angura</HI> in <HI>Asia.</HI> No Olives, Oranges, or Lemons grow here. There are above 100 Villages on these Mountains, besides several Monasteries. The Inhabitants are a Warr-like People, and withstood
<PB N="86" REF="54"/>the <HI>Turks</HI> above 20 years after <HI>Rettimo</HI> was taken, living as the <HI>Mainiotes</HI> in the <HI>Morea.</HI> There are such difficult passages to them, that an army can∣not march. Now at last they are brought into obedience, and by humbling themselves to the Vizier, he granted them great privileges, to in∣courage them, least they should take part with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who have the Island of <HI>Suda</HI> so near them. As the Vizier past by in his way from <HI>Canea</HI> to <HI>Candia,</HI> they brought him several presents, which the Mountains produced; which he was so well pleased with, that he exempted them from going with him, and paying their at∣tendance on him, only he obliged them to furnish the Camp with mutton at a certain rate. Most of his own provision was carryed from hence. Sheep at three <HI>timins</HI> (about a shilling) a piece, butter at a <HI>timine</HI> the <HI>oke</HI> (a groat for two pound 8 ounces) Cheese at the same rate, and at this price they were obliged to carry it as far as the Camp before <HI>Candia,</HI> where an officer gave them an acquittance, which was abated them out of their tribute. They have a certain Drugg, called by the <HI>Venetian Oldani,</HI> much of the colour of Li∣quorish in balls, it is a very great conforter of the head, having a pleasant smell, being burnt it gives a very pleasant sent. Most of this is bought up by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and sent to <HI>Venice.</HI> Here is also a sort of wood which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Platte
<PB N="87" REF="54"/>iksillo,</HI> it burns like a torch &amp; gives a most fragrant smell; much of it was used to burn at the Siege. Every night at the Viziers, and other great mens tents they had fires of this wood, the wood be∣ing cut small, and put into an Iron grate at the end of a pole fastned in the ground. If a man be hot in the plain, in riding two or three hours up the hills, he shall find so great an alteration in the air, as is incredible. About 15 miles from <HI>Retimo</HI> is a lovely Fountain called <HI>Bognare Bashe,</HI> standing so between two mountains, that at 2 in the afternoon it is shady, continuing so all the rest of the day. The water is so cold as will cause a dew upon any fruit that is put into it, and be one never so hot, to drink of this water it will do him no harm: In the Summer time here are always some persons of Quality, who bring their beds, and continue for several days together. The <HI>Sfacioti</HI> are a healthy, strong, and stout people, they pretend to be of a very Ancient Stock, some there are who derive their family from be∣fore the coming of our Saviour. I saw a <HI>Callojero</HI> that was 110 years of age, he was very lusty and could walk very well with a staff. Part of these hills are under the Jurisdiction of the Bishop of <HI>Retimo,</HI> and part under that of <HI>Canea.</HI> From <HI>Retimo</HI> to <HI>Canea,</HI> the Road is most by the Sea side passing by the Bay of <HI>Suda,</HI> having the moun∣tains of <HI>Sfacia</HI> on the left hand.
<PB N="88" REF="55"/></P>
<P><HI>Canea</HI> is seated in a fine plain about 3 miles from the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Suda,</HI> and upon the Sea to the North, having a very fair harbour which may be called a double Port, the one be∣ing round, the other stretching away to the East∣ward; where are two Arsenals. It is secure a∣gainst the worst of weathers, The entrance is narrow, and not above 18 foot water. To the West of which the <HI>Turks</HI> have built a new batte∣ry with 20 very large Guns, and above it to the South is a great Cittadel, in which are 40 good Guns. To the East of the Entrance is another great Castle which commands the part called the <HI>Sabioniera,</HI> with the Arsenal. Round about the Port is a broad key, which is always full with merchandize, and is little inferior to the Port at <HI>Marseilles.</HI> The houses are all very well built and not much batter'd. The Walls are in very good repair, having a dry ditch about 30 yards broad, and 6 deep, from the land on the other side. The Walls are about 30 foot high; within them the earth is raised, about 10 foot higher than the Walls, there being a walk between. There is a mount which they call the <HI>Marteningo</HI> where formerly were 10 Guns, but now it is of no use. Toward the land there are 4 Bastions. To the South is the great gate called <HI>La Porti di Retimo.</HI> To the West is a mace placed on the Wall, to shew where a <HI>Basha,</HI> at the taking of the place,
<PB N="89" REF="55"/>first enter'd the City: before the Gate is a half moon built of earth about 20 foot high; at each end is a small Pyramid of mortar and sculls, which are the sculls of Christians, who were slain be∣fore the place in the year 1666. The <HI>Venetians</HI> then attempting to regain the place under the conduct of <HI>Marquis Vila,</HI> a Savojard, 5000 men were landed at <HI>Culatte</HI> at the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Suda,</HI> and were encamped before the City several days. The <HI>Turks</HI> sallyed out of the City, to the W<SUP>t</SUP>. surprizing the Christians, and had a ve∣ry great victory, pursuing them to the Fort which was built at the bottom of the Bay. In this flight there were above 1500 killed and se∣veral taken Prisoners: amongst the latter was one Captain <HI>Scot,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI>-man, who had his hand upon the draw-bridg of the City; he was carryed afterwards to <HI>Smyrna</HI> in the Gally's and there redeem'd by the <HI>English</HI> Merchants: but when he came to <HI>Venice</HI> his arrears were paid him and he returned his ransom to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which re∣main'd in bank, till another like occasion should present it self. The City is near three miles in circumference, and is much better Inhabited than <HI>Candia,</HI> having a <HI>Basha</HI> and other officers as in <HI>Candia,</HI> only in all Councils the other hath the precedence. The Country about is very plea∣sant, being all a plain for above 6 miles to the South and West, planted with young Olive trees
<PB N="90" REF="56"/>so that it seems to be a Garden. It is well sup∣ply'd, both with Flesh, and Fish, of the latter there is great store, for besides the Sea, there is a Lake about 10 miles to the South, which furnishes them with great variety of all sorts. The trade is much greater here than at <HI>Candia,</HI> it lying so convenient, for the <HI>Morea, Italy,</HI> and other pla∣ces. The <HI>French</HI> have a great trade for oyl, wools, wax, cheese, and several other commo∣dities, having a Consul, and two Merchants. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have also a Consul, but most of their oyl is shipped off from <HI>Suda,</HI> to which place it is brought from <HI>Retimo</HI> and other places there∣about. All great ships come to an anchor at a place called S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Todoro,</HI> being 2 small Isletts about 5 miles to the West of the Port of <HI>Canea;</HI> there is very good anchorage, and a small Fort to defend them. On one Island, notwithstanding it seems to be all stone, and is very low, there are several Fountains of water. No <HI>Greeks</HI> live within the City. They have a new town built to the South, about half a mile off, where are two long streets, very commodious, and here they injoy all the li∣berty they desire: their Churches are open, and the Bishop hath a very pleasant house, living in good Esteem. Close to this town runs a pleasant River, which is seldom dry, There are likewise several pleasant gardens, well stock't with all sorts of delicious fruits. The <HI>Turks</HI> have also
<PB N="91" REF="56"/>some gardens here, but they must retire into the City an hour before Sun set, winter and summer, or else must remain out all night, the gates being then shut, and a strict watch kept about the Walls. The <HI>Turks</HI> of this place are generally ve∣ry rich, and incline to trade, giving all encourage∣ment to have Merchants come and reside amongst them. There was an <HI>English</HI> merchant here one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Trenchard,</HI> who was recommended to the <HI>French</HI> Consul to have his assistance, but in a lit∣tle time he grew weary of the place. Here they keep their oyl in great Vessels called <HI>Tini,</HI> which are square and made of wood, some will hold 20 Tunns. They have a special regard to preserve the esteem of their oyl, nor will they force a merchant to take any longer than it comes clear, not mixing the bottoms, as in some parts they will, by taking a hollow cane, and putting it to the bottom, by blowing through which they raise the foot of the oyl, so that thick and thin goes together. Here they sell the Foot of the oyl at an under price; and this serves to make sope. Most parts of <HI>Turky</HI> have an Esteem for <HI>Canea</HI> oyl above others. Some will have it to be the better for that the trees are all so young; others impute it to their care in the making, for here they gather all their Olives, whereas in the <HI>Morea</HI> they thrash them down with poles. The wines are generally Esteem'd above all others. The red muscadine
<PB N="92" REF="57"/>they call here <HI>Leattico,</HI> 'tis a richer wine than <HI>Tent</HI> at <HI>Cadize,</HI> and much more pleasant. I have seen it sold at 15 gallons for half a dollar. White muscadine is not so good as that at <HI>Luxu∣ria</HI> in <HI>Ceffalonia.</HI> Some are of opinion that in the Warr the true Muscadine grape was lost; on the Mountains there are smaller sorts of Wine, so as a man may have what sort he pleases. All sorts of Provision are very plentiful, but in the Summer time the mutton hath generally a bad tast, which proceeds from their feeding on some hearb on the Mountains. Here are Fowl of all sorts in a∣bundance; but especially a bird called <HI>Beccha Figge,</HI> which is almost a lump of Fat: they are valued about 4 for an asper, (or 8 for a penny) Turtle-doves and Quailes are very plentifull. Their Beef is small, but very sweet. Of Fruits there is no sort, but what they have. I never saw larger pears than are brought from the Moun∣tains, being a sort of Sugar pear. Their musk∣melons are very good, but their water-melons are singular. Salating there is all the year of all sorts: no place is esteem'd to have larger and bet∣ter Endive and Carduus, than there are here. I have seen Sugar canes of a great height, full as good as what are brought from <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI> There are abundance of Simples which are bought here for <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Some say the reason why no Venemous thing will live on this Island, is
<PB N="93" REF="57"/>the quantity of <HI>Dittamo</HI> that grows here. O∣thers say it has only been since S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Paul</HI> set foot upon the Island. Most of the <HI>Candiotes</HI> pretend to have great knowledg in Simples. The women are experienced Doctoresses. One I have reason to say was very skilful, she having in a little time wrought a great cure upon me; For by accident a Bullet having past through my Legg, I applyed my self to her, and in 15 days she cured it. She did not allow me to eat any flesh, till it was per∣fectly well. They have several antidotes against the Plague, but they had not the effect they pre∣tended, for several of the Doctoresses were swept away by that disease, but most certain it is that af∣ter S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>John Baptists</HI> day, it did here abate, as they always observe it in most of these Eastern parts. There are several other places that have had the name of Citys, which are now heaps of ruins; many hundred stately Pallaces there were that now have only some Walls, and those most fallen down. The <HI>Candiots</HI> keep their Habit, that is the women, but the men are most <HI>alla Turches∣ca,</HI> especially the better sort. They are as Ig∣norant of the Antiquity of their Country, as the <HI>Moreotes,</HI> that have been above 200 years in sla∣very. There is no Latin Church upon the whole Island (as I was informed) but what is shut up, or converted to the <HI>Turks</HI> use. Before the <HI>Turks</HI> conquered this Island, there were above a million
<PB N="94" REF="58"/>of Souls, whereas now there are not 80000, of which not obove 30000 <HI>Turks</HI> on the whole Island.</P>

<HEAD>The Isletts, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> have about the Island of <HI>CANDIA,</HI> are</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CArabusa</HI> to the West end of the Island, a∣bout six miles from the main, having a very good Port between the Islett and the main Island: the Castle is very strong, having about 80 Guns. In the late Warr it withstood several assaults, but it lying so far from any considerable City, the <HI>Turks</HI> did not so much mind it as they did <HI>Suda.</HI> Here is a continual Garrison of <HI>Venetian</HI> soldiers and a Proveditore, who is under the Inquisitore at <HI>Suda.</HI> In time of peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> they have a continual trade and very good correspon∣dence with them, having all sorts of provision at very reasonable rates.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Spina Longa,</HI> lyes about 40 miles to the East of the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> at the Entrance of a great Bay. The Islett is not above a mile and a half about, it has a very good Fortification round it, besides 'tis steep all about, so as an Enemy cannot well land. It is not above a mile from a point of land, where the <HI>Turks</HI> raised a Battery, and continued for a week to batter the Castle, but to little Purpose, for most of their dwellings are in
<PB N="95" REF="58"/>Caves under ground. Here and at <HI>Carabusa</HI> is no water but what is brought them by shipping. or what they save in great Cisterns and Jarrs. Here is also a Proveditore and a Garrison of <HI>Vene∣tian</HI> soldiers.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Suda</HI> lyes in a great Bay about 30 miles from <HI>Retimo</HI> West, 12 miles from <HI>Canea,</HI> and 9 from the bottom of the Bay South East, having the land to the South about a mile, and to the N W<SUP>t</SUP>. not above half a mile distant. The Island is about 2 miles in circumference, not above 50 foot above the water at the highest part, being all rock and steep round. To the S W<SUP>t</SUP>. lyes a long Rock about 10 foot above water, and not above 20 from the Island; against it is the Entrance up to the Castle very steep and winding; having two Gates, and a strong counterscarp before you pass into the main Castle. The Wall about the Island is low but very thick. To the W<SUP>t</SUP>. is a Mount called <HI>il Marteningo,</HI> about 30 Foot high, and 300 in circumference very strongly built with small stone and mortar, which has above 1000 shot in it. They are so fast in, that it would indanger its falling, if they should be pull'd out. The Castle is quite round the Islett, wherein and upon the <HI>Marteningo</HI> are about 120 Guns planted. The <HI>Turks</HI> have several times attempted to take this place, and to that purpose in the year 1659 they built 6 Castles, three on
<PB N="96" REF="59"/>each side of the Bay, from whence they conti∣nued to batter it, and secured the Harbour so, as no Ship or Gally could come to bring them succor, but what in the night small Vessels would adventure to get in. In the year 1665 the Ca∣ptain <HI>Basha</HI> attempted to assault it; he came with 45 Gally's, but durst not adventure to land any men. He caused the Gallys to batter that part which is to Sea-ward, while on the other side they continually fired from the 6 Forts. The <HI>Ve∣netian</HI> Fleet was so dispersed that they could not come to relieve them. The besieged were much streightned for provision, but most for want of wa∣ter, for above a month they had but a pint a day, and were so disheartned that they near inclined to surrender the place. But it pleased God to shew them his goodness in a signal manner, by a shot from the Enemy, which did cleave a rock in sunder at the bottom a little above the Sea, out of which sprang a water which sufficed them to drink. I have seen the Fountain, and drank of the water, tho it is not very pleasant. Several Of∣ficers that were in the Island, when it was Besieg∣ed avouched this for a truth; It being noted in the <HI>Venetian</HI> History of <HI>Suda.</HI> The winds com∣ing about Northerly the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet came from <HI>Zante,</HI> forcing the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallys to retreat. The Captain <HI>Basha</HI> was kill'd with a great shot, upon which the Army broke up, and retired to
<PB N="97" REF="59"/><HI>Canea.</HI> The Vizier in his march from <HI>Canea</HI> to <HI>Candia</HI> past by here, and with admiration beheld the place, but would not attempt any thing a∣gainst it, saying, <HI>it was not worth the men which had been already lost against it.</HI> The Port is very commodious, being one of the largest in all these Seas, and there is very good anchor-hold all over the Bay. At the bottom of which are salt panns. The <HI>Turks</HI> have here a small Tower, where are two or three servants of the Customer of <HI>Canea,</HI> to see that no goods are carried away; which have not paid Custome at the City. In time of peace they have all provissions from <HI>Canea,</HI> at the mar∣ket price, and there is a good Correspondence betwixt the Inquisitore of <HI>Suda,</HI> and the <HI>Basha,</HI> who often send letters to one another. The Go∣vernor of <HI>Suda</HI> hath the title of <HI>Inquisitore Gene∣rale delle Isole di Levante; Cerigo</HI> and <HI>Tine,</HI> be∣ing also under his Government, altho' there are Providetors to both.

<HEAD>A Relation of a <HI>Storm</HI> and great <HI>Deli∣verance</HI> at <HI>Sea,</HI> in a Voyage from <HI>NEW ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1683, I embarqued aboard the Rose Friggot (Captain <HI>William Phipps</HI> Com∣mander) with my Brother M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Randolph</HI> who was sent to <HI>New-England</HI> with the <HI>Quo War∣ranto</HI> against the <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Colony</HI> of the <HI>Mas∣sathusetts</HI> Bay. About the 12 of <HI>September</HI> we departed from the <HI>Downs,</HI> and in 5 weeks arrived in the Port of <HI>Boston,</HI> which is the Principal Town of all <HI>New-England.</HI> Upon our arrival a Court was called to consult how they should proceed, and it was carryed in the general, that they should defend their Charter at <HI>Law,</HI> and resolved they were to defend it; which was all the answer that my Brother could get from them. So he resolv'd to Embarque upon the first ship bound for <HI>England,</HI> which was a small Pink called the Adventure, <HI>John Balston</HI> Master, belonging to <HI>New-England.</HI> The 12 of <HI>December</HI> we imbarqued; several other Pas∣sengers were with us, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain <HI>Mark Talbot</HI> Son of the present Earl of <HI>Tirconnel,</HI> (who came by land from <HI>New York</HI> to <HI>Boston</HI>) M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Whar∣ton,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Johnson,</HI> and 4 or 5 men more with three women, one being with child near her time, having with her two small Children. About
<PB N="99" REF="60"/>9 of the Clock in the morning we weighed anchor, and with a fresh N W<SUP>t</SUP>. wind got clear of the land by Sun set. The wind continued favorable several days, and gave us hopes of a prosperous and quick passage. When we were got to the height of the Western Islands, our Master order'd a New main Sail to be brought to yard, which proved too wide by two cloaths; (or breadths of Canvas) so it was again taken down, and first fair day it was fitted, and brought to the yard. The winds were veerable for several days, and the near∣er we came to the Channel, we found a great head Sea, (i. e. a Sea coming against us) which made us fear we should find Easterly winds. A∣bout the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January,</HI> we judged our selves to be about 100 Leagues to the Westward of the lands-end. The wind came up at East, and con∣tinued for two days very stormy, so as we could not carry any sail abroad but were drove to and fro', at the mercy of the sea, whose waves were grown to that height, that we feared we should have been swallowed up in them. The 23<SUP>d</SUP> the wind abated, we saw a ship which was to Lee∣ward of us, and made signs to speak to us, so we boare up, and coming to Lee-ward of them, found it was an <HI>English</HI> ship called the President, which came from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and had been beating (i. e. striving against the wind) above 6 weeks in the Channel. We came so near as we durst ven∣ture,
<PB N="100" REF="61"/>when they begged of us for Gods sake to spare them some provision for they were ready to perish: And notwithstanding the seas run so high yet did they adventure to hoise out their Pin∣nace with which 8 men came aboard our ship, re∣presenting to us the miserable condition which they were in, being 80 persons aboard, who for a months time had lived on a pound of bread for a week, and a pint of water a day each man; most humbly did they begg that we would spare them some provision, otherwise they must of necessity perish. So our Master gave them about 100 <HI>l</HI> of bread, a Barrel of Bear, and promised them, that he would not go from them, but if the weather were moderate he would supply them next day with what he could well spare. All that night the wind encreased, as next morning both the President and we were forced to hand all our sails and hull (lye with our head to the wind without any saile.) The 25<SUP>th</SUP> we lost sight of the President, and the storme increased still more and more. The 26<SUP>th</SUP> about 4 of the clock in the afternoon, a sea broak upon our ship, which carryed away the wasts of the ship (i. e. that part of the sides above the up∣per deck) even with the upper deck, from the quar∣ter deck to the fore Castle; the Boate, Capstern, Windess and Sheat-anchor were washt away, my Chest was fast at the one side of the Cabin door, &amp; M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Johnsons</HI> at the other, were both washt
<PB N="101" REF="61"/>away. The Master immediatly ordered the mi∣zane-mast to be cut down, the better to keep the ship before the wind; the sea had a free pas∣sage into the hold between the Timber heads (i. e. topps of the ribbs of the ship,) to stop which we imployed our blankets and ruggs, con∣tinuing to pump, with both pumps, and all little enough to keep our ship above water; none in the ship but were wet, and washed several times by the sea. Never was a longer night seen to any of us, and the whole night we were imploy∣ed to keep the pumps going, fearing all our en∣deavours would prove vain. About 4 in the morning one of our Pumps did suck, which was the most comfortable news we could then expect, but yet we were not free from fears least the Seas should wash away those ruggs which we had stop∣ed in between the timbers. Sleep was quite ba∣nish't from our eyes all that night, and when the morning appeared (which was welcomed with our great thanks to Almighty God for the sight of another day) we endeavoured to make a stronger resistance against the seas, finding that the continual working of the sea had almost washt away our ruggs, and what means to use, our confused thoughts knew not. But God put into our Masters mind the two peices of Canvas which our main-saile was over charged with, which he order'd to be brought up, and when we had well
<PB N="102" REF="62"/>forc't in the blankets and ruggs, then we spread the Canvas over it, nailing it down with pieces of hoops at each side; all the time the sea washed the men who were made fast with ropes, and by this means (Blessed be God) we kept our ship free with one Pump continually going. The fury of this storm continued three days, and three nights driving us above 200 leagues back again. <HI>Janu∣ary</HI> the 30<SUP>th</SUP>. the wind abated and veer'd about to the North-West, but the sea continued high from the Eastward, so as we were fain to keep an easy saile, not to force the ship into a head sea. <HI>February</HI> 3<SUP>d</SUP> the wind increased at W N W<SUP>t</SUP>. all night. We having only our two Courses abroad. Towards break of day, we handed our main∣course, but before it was well secured the storm came so violently upon us, that the Master order'd the fore-yard likewise to be lower'd, but all their strength could not get it down, nor was there any of the men that had a knife (having only their drawers without pockets) to cut the saile (which they would have done) so as it forc't the head of the ship into the sea, and stopt her way as a great sea poop't us (that is it broke over our Stern) and fill'd us, as we all expected immediat∣ly to go down to the bottom, nothing but the Masts and fore-Castle were above water, the Master stood by the remaining part of the Mizan-mast, fastned to it with a rope, nothing
<PB N="103" REF="62"/>but his head was above water; and for a small time the ship remained without any motion, but God of his infinite goodness was pleased again to draw us from the Deep. Our ship with another Sea was lifted up, and our fore-saile was got down and stowed. We were forced to bore holes between decks to let the water into Hold, and could not Pump out in six hours time the water we received with that sea. We continued with∣out saile all that day, and the wind continu'd fair. The 8<SUP>th</SUP>. the wind abated, and the seas were more moderate; so we hoised our Main-saile, with which and our fore-saile, (both reeft) we stood in for the Channel, about noon we saw a saile having but one mast, judged it to be a Ketch, but drawing nearer found it was a ship in distress, having lost her main and mizane masts, several Guns were fierd to give us notice of their great ne∣cessity, so we loosed the reef (holes made to les∣sen the saile in stormy weather) of our main-saile, steering directly towards them. About three of the clock in the afternoon we came up with the ship, and coming under their Stern, the Master with the rest of the men got up, upon the quarter deck, upon their knees, with stretched-out arms, bare heads and a dolefull voice, cryed out to us to save them for the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> sake, for that their ship had six foot water in Hold, and could not be longer kept above water. What heart
<PB N="104" REF="63"/>but must relent at such lamentable cryes, &amp; who could pass by, without doing them all possible. good! We promised them to take them all in, de∣sireing them to bring what provission they could well save. They had but one Boat which was but small, and could not bring them all together, so they resolved to come away as many as could, and those who remained aboard, were to get provision ready to bring with them. The men promissing the Captain to return with the boat and fetch their Companions, which without their promise he would not have come out of the ship, and without him they question'd if they should be received by us. The Master with 12 more (be∣ing as many as could be in the Boat) came off, the seas run so very high, as we thought it im∣possible the Boat could ever get aboard us, 4 men rowed and the rest with hats and caps, hoave the water out of the boat, &amp; so soon as they came to our ship side, every one greedy to get in, let the boat knock against our ship side, so as her leaks increased, and soon filled with water that none of the men would adventure to return for their companions, but suffer'd the boat to go a drift, which so much greived the Master and us all as was unexpressible, he having nothing but a cap on his head made of a Napkin, not so much as his Journal or any other book, ordering the Boatswain to bring them with him. But there was
<PB N="105" REF="63"/>no recovering the boat, and night coming on, we came so near as we could to the ship, calling to the men to make a raft with boards, and keep a broad a light, so as next morning we might en∣deavour to get them aboard; but so soon as they perceived the boat was gone, and no hopes of keeping the ship above water, they gave us a sad cry, which pierced the very hearts of us all; but all our endeavours could not availe to help them. We lay by them to wind-ward, they putting a broad a light, but in 3 hours after their Compa∣nions had gotten aboard our ship, (being about eight at night) their ship sunk, in which 5 men were lost. The ship was called the <HI>Green Friggat</HI> Captain <HI>John Sugars</HI> Commander, who came from <HI>Virginia,</HI> wanting 7 weeks, and from that Coast saw no other Vessel but ours. They had ve∣ry bad weather all the way, lost their main-mast and mizan-mast, in the same storm in which we lost the Wasts of our ship; they had cast over board a great part of their goods, that were stow∣ed between decks, two Pumps were continually imployed, and the water so increased upon them, that they despaired of all hopes. One of the men being on the stump of the main-mast to fasten a rope to get out more goods, he saw our ship, which so rejoyced them, that immediatly they put out their Colours firing several Guns to give us notice of their condition. The Commander
<PB N="106" REF="64"/>had all his Estate in the ship, nothing was Insured, and he saved nothing but his life. Now we were to consider how we should maintain such an ad∣dition of mouths, without any supply of provi∣sion. But God Almighty the only Preserver of all things, did provide for us. We had about a quarter of a pound of bread a day, meat twice a week, and a point of water a day for a man. The Sea-men were allowed something more then the Passengers by reason of their continual labour. And as our Provision was short, so was our Ap∣petites abated. The Sea-men whom we saved, assisted at the Pumps easing us Passengers some∣what. We reckoned our selves about 80 Leagues from the lands end, when we took up Captain <HI>Sugars</HI> and his men. The 10<SUP>th</SUP>. of <HI>February</HI> we Sounded and found about 60 fathom water, and having the wind at S<SUP>o</SUP>. we stood in for the Chan∣nel, at night we Sounded again, and found we were shot within <HI>Silly</HI> at the Entrance of <HI>Bristol</HI> Channel. At day break we saw the land on our Starboard-side, which confirmed to us where we were; The wind increased so as we could not maintain any other saile abroad but our Courses, with which we stood off from the shoar. About noon the wind veered to the W<SUP>t</SUP>. blowing so hard that we were forced to hand our Courses (low sailes) and drive with the Sea, every sea wash∣ing over us. It pleased God about midd-night
<PB N="107" REF="64"/>the wind came to the N W<SUP>t</SUP>. so as we lay our head towards <HI>Silly,</HI> and next morning found the Island on our Lee, so made saile with our fore-saile, and past between <HI>Silly,</HI> and the main, and after all our great daingers (Blessed be God) the 13<SUP>th</SUP>. of <HI>February</HI> we got safe into <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, and immediatly all the Passengers got ashoar where (upon our bended knees) we acknowledged the great deliverance which we received. Here we had the news that the <HI>President</HI> we mentioned, which we met and relieved at sea, was forc't a∣shoar (in the Storm we were in the 10<SUP>th</SUP>.) in <HI>Mounts-Bay,</HI> and of 80 persons only 2 sav'd, they were so weak for want of provision as they could not hand their Saile. The woman with Child hired a horse with a paire of panniers, in each she put a Child, her self riding between them, and got safe to <HI>London,</HI> where in less then a Week she was delivered of a Boy. What is remarkable more, is, to consider the great cold which was this year over all these Seas, and the many Shipwrecks which happened. The sea had a continual pas∣sage over us, so as our Deck was covered with a green. Many a time and hour, have I stood pump∣ing, with nothing but a Coat, over my Shirt, and a pair of drawers, that the Seas have washed me to the Wast, so was it with the rest of the Pas∣sengers, who were able to pump, and not one who was troubled with cough or cold, notwith∣staning
<PB N="108" REF="65"/>we were several times wet in the places, where we slept: Oh what tongue can express the loving kindness, and the tender Mercys of our Good God to the Children of men: Therefore to him alone, from whom alone cometh all our help and comfort, be ascribed all Honour and Glory World without end, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<CELL>Cakoa Ruins of a large Ci∣ty; supposed to be The∣spiae lying at the foot of M. Helicon dedicated to the Muses. In the year 1674 I was here in com∣pany with Monsieur <HI>Gi∣rand</HI> Sr <HI>Giles Eastcourt</HI> and Mr <HI>Francis Vernon.</HI> There are the entire Walls of 12 Temples and the Founda∣tion of a large Castle. To the South is a great Rock, in which several Rooms are cut, which have pla∣ces about 8 foot long, 2 broad and one deep, all cut out of the same Rock, and are supposed to have been burying places. Some Rooms have 6 partitions, some more some less.</CELL>
