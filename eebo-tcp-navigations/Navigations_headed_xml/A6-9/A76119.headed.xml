<HEAD>THE TRUE RELATION OF C<SUP>apt:</SUP> WILL: BATTEN: TOUCHING The transporting of the six MEMBERS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas the Reports are various concerning the going beyond Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of six or the eleven Members: And that some hath under∣taken to put it in Print con∣contrary to Truth: I shall therefore brief∣ly and truly set it downe, as followeth.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P>Sir <HI>Philip Stapleton:</HI> Sir <HI>William Lewis:</HI> Sir <HI>William Waller:</HI> Sir <HI>John Clotworthy,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Long:</HI> hired a small Ketch to trans∣port them to <HI>Holland:</HI> which Ketch be∣longed unto one <HI>Greene,</HI> being let to them for twenty pounds, halfe whereof was paid in hand, and the other halfe at their landing, and sixtie pounds securitie: gi∣ven for to Insure the Ketch: All this was done by the consent of the said <HI>Green:</HI> The place where they were to be receiv'd: was <HI>Should-Haven,</HI> a little below <HI>Tilbury-Hope:</HI> where foure of these Gentlemen came by Land, and Sir <HI>Iohn Clotworthy</HI> in a paire of Oares by <HI>Gravesend:</HI> who all met there, and imbarked themselves; <HI>Green</HI> like a craftie fellow, having re∣ceiv'd the moitie of his Money, puts in another Master to goe over with the Ves∣sel, and as soone as the Gentlemen were imbarked, goes up to the <HI>Block-house</HI> to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and there informes Captaine <HI>Redman,</HI> that they were gone away with his Vessell, with a great deale of Treasure.</P>
<P>Whereupon, the said Captaine gives
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>him a Warrant to pursue, and make stay of them, and to that purpose sent a Trooper with him, who comming downe into <HI>Kent,</HI> before <HI>Marrget</HI> espied this Ketch and there told the <HI>Marrget men</HI> that they were runne away with his Ketch, and had fifteen <HI>Portmantuas</HI> of Treasure a∣bord.</P>
<P>The men of <HI>Marrget</HI> very readily beat up their Drums, &amp; manned A <HI>Doggerboate,</HI> that was bound to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and one <HI>Roger Lamings</HI> had the command of her, who a little before had a Commission from some of these Gentlemen, to raise a Company against the Armie, and received ten pounds in Money, and had raised some force.</P>
<P>This <HI>Lamings</HI> pursued after them tho∣rough the <HI>Downes;</HI> but they were gone two or three leagues a head of: so calling to the <HI>Nicodemas,</HI> a Frigat under my Com∣mand: who presently let slip, and follow∣ed him, and halfe Seas over brought her up: who very readily and willingly came backe with them to me: so that she was
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>not brought back by <HI>Laminges</HI> as is sugge∣sted.</P>
<P>This sixteenth of <HI>August,</HI> at night, the <HI>Nicodemas</HI> brought back the vessell, with the Members, whom I tooke abord the Ship, and secured the Vessell, and about eight a clock at night, sent away <HI>Lamings</HI> to <HI>Marget,</HI> to see what <HI>Green,</HI> or any o∣thers had any pretences against them: charging him to be back in the morning early.</P>
<P>The seventeenth, in the Morning I called a Councell of Warre, the Result whereof was, that in regard these Members had all severall passes, from the <HI>Speaker</HI> of the House of <HI>Commons:</HI> dated the tenth, and eleventh of <HI>August,</HI> and an Order of both Houses to the <HI>Speaker</HI> for granting them: It was held fit to dismisse them; After their Vessell was searched by Sir <HI>Georg Askew,</HI> Captaine <HI>Crandley,</HI> Captaine <HI>Moore,</HI> Captaine <HI>Passey:</HI> the Master of the Ketch, and divers others, where was nothing found, but five <HI>Portmantuas:</HI> with a suit for each of waring Apparell, and the like
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>necessaries, and not a pennie of money as was suggested; and about twelve a clock, no man appearing from <HI>Marget,</HI> they were dismist, in regard of the extreame sick∣nesse of Sir <HI>Phillip Stapleton,</HI> that he might not lie another night on the water, but land at <HI>Callis</HI> before night, where hee is since dead: About two a clock that after∣noone, <HI>Lamings</HI> returned with <HI>Greene,</HI> and the Trooper with Captaine <HI>Redmans</HI> War∣rant; the Vessell then being neare halfe Seas ove, And whereas it is reported, and prin∣ted, that they were reviled, and basely used, tis utterly false; the Trooper was shewed their Passes, who was therewith satisfied, and dranke a cup of Wine: It is true, that I told <HI>Greene</HI> and <HI>Lamings</HI> of their knaverie.</P>
<P>And for Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> he came not to mee till the twentie one, and brought the <HI>Spea∣kers</HI> Passe of the eleventh: and an Order of the <HI>Committe</HI> of the Admiralty of the thirteenth, for a Ship to transport him, who went out of the <HI>Downes</HI> the two and twen∣tieth in the morning, upon the <HI>Leopard:</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>who was bound toward St. <HI>Mallo,</HI> on ano∣ther designe.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a short and true Re∣lation of the businesse, which I will justifie to the world: and have all their Passes and papers to make it good.</P>
