Bourchier and Louaine, Maister of the Queens
Maiesties horse, and knight of the most honorable

of all honour and happinesse.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>Ight Honorable, hauing by chaunce reco∣uered
of late into my handes (after I had
once lost the same) a copie of the Discourse
of our late VVest Indian voyage, vvhich
vvas begun by Captaine Bigges, vvho en∣ded
his life in the said voyage after our de∣parture
from Cartagena, the same being
aftervvardes finished (as I thinke) by
his Lieutenant Maister Croftes, or some other, I knovve not
vvell vvho. Novve finding therein a most true report of the
seruices and other matters vvhich happened in the sayd voyage,
the sight vvhereof is vvonderfully desired by manie honest and
vvell disposed persons. I haue presumed to recommend the pub∣lishing
thereof, vnto your Lordships protection and fauour, for
these tvvo causes. The one, for that your Lordships Honoura∣ble
disposition is in the knovvledge of all men that knovv your
selfe, most thirstingly affected to embrace in your ovvne person,
<PB REF="3"/>
the brauest enterprises, if the time vvould once affoord anie
such fit occasion, as might be agreeable to her Maiesties re∣solution:
vvho vvisely (and long may she do it) gouerneth
all things to the greatest aduantage of her selfe and people.
The other, because my selfe hauing bene a member in the sayd
actions, and vvas Lieutenant of Maister Carleils ovvne
companie, vvhereby I can vvell assure the truth of this re∣port:
I thought it my bounden duetie, hauing professed my
seruice to your Lordship before all men, to dedicate the same
rather vnto your Lordship then to anie other. And although
it be novve a yeare and a halfe sithence the voyage ended,
vvhereby some man vvill say, that it is novve no nevve
matter: yet the present time considered, hovv doubtfull some
of our meaner sort of people are of the Spanish preparations,
I thinke this Discourse a very fit thing to be published, that
they may see vvhat great victories a fevve English men haue
made vpon great numbers of the Spaniardes, euen at home in
their ovvne countreyes. The beholding vvhereof vvill much
encourage those, vvho by fame and bare vvordes are made to
doubt much more then there is cause vvhy they should. Vpon
vvhich point, as there may be much sayd: so my selfe being no
Discourser, do desire to be held excused therein: and there∣fore
doe onely commend the trueth of this report vnto your
Lordship: vvhich vvill be also auovved by diuers Captaines
that vvere in the sayd voyage. And so in all humblenesse
do take my leaue, readie to do your Lordship all faithfull seruice.</P>

<P>After our going hence, which was the fourteenth
of September, in the yeare of our Lord, one thow∣sand
fiue hundred eighty and fiue: and taking our
course towards Spaine, we had the winde for a few
daies somewhat skant, and sometimes calme. And
being ariued neere that part of the coast of Spaine,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
which is called the Mores, we happened to espie
diuerse sailes, which kept their course close by the
shore, the weather being faire and calme. The Ge∣nerall
caused the Vizeadmirall to goe with the Pin∣naces
well manned to see what they were, who vp∣pon
sight of the said pinnaces approching nere vn∣to
them, abandonned for the most parte all their
shippes (being Frenchmen) laden all with salt, and
bounde homewardes into France, amongst which
ships (being all but of small burden) there was one
so well liked, which also had no man in her, as being
brought vnto the Generall, he thought good to
make stay of her for the seruice, meaning to pay for
her, as was accordingly performed at our returne,
which barke was called the Drake. The rest of these
ships being eight or nine, were dismissed without
any thing at all taken from them. VVe being after∣wards
put somewhat further off from the shore, by
the contrarietie of winde, we happened to meete
with some other French ships, full laden with New∣land
fish, being vpon their returne homeward from
the said New found land: whom the Generall after
some speech had with them, and seeing plainly that
they were Frenchmen, dismissed without once suf∣fering
any man to go aboord of them.</P>
<P>The day following standing in with the shore a∣gaine,
we discried an other tall ship of twelue score
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
tunnes or thereabouts, vpon whom Maister Car∣leill
the Lieutenant generall being in the Tiger, vn∣dertooke
the chase, whom also anone after the Ad∣mirall
followed, and the Tiger hauing caused the
said strange ship to strike her sailes, kept her there
without suffering any bodie to go aboord vntill the
Admirall was come vp: who foorthwith sending for
the Maister, and diuerse others of their principall
men, and causing them to be seuerally examined,
founde the ship and goodes to be belonging to the
inhabitants of S. SEBASTIAN in Spaine, but the
marriners to be for the most parte belonging to
S. Iohn de LVCE &amp; the passage. In this ship was great
store of drie Newland fish, commonly called with
vs Poore Iohn, wherof afterwards being thus found
a lawfull prize, there was distribution made into all
the ships of the Fleete, the same being so newe and
good, as it did very greatly bestead vs in the whole
course of our voyage. A day or two after the taking
of this ship, we put in with the Isles of BAYON, for
lacke of fauourable wind, where we had no sooner
anckered some part of the Fleete, but the Generall
commaunded all the Pinnaces with the ship boates
to be manned, and euerie man to be furnished with
such armes as was needefull for that present seruice,
which being done, the Generall put him selfe into
his Galley, which was also well furnished, and row∣ing
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
towards the Citie of BAYON, with intent, &amp; the
fauour of the Almighty to surprise it. Before we had
aduaunced one halfe league of our way, there came
a messenger being an English Marchant form the
Gouernour, to see what straunge Fleete we were,
who came to our Generall, and conferred a while
with him, and after a small time spent, our Generall
called for Captaine Sampson, and willed him to go
to the Gouernour of the Citie, to resolue him of
two pointes. The first, to knowe if there were any
warres betweene Spaine and England. The second
why our Marchants with their goods were imbar∣red
or arrested. Thus departed Captaine Sampson
with the said messenger to the citie, where he found
the Gouernour and people much amazed of such a
sudden accident.</P>
<P>The Generall with the aduise and counsell of
Maister Carleill his Lieutenant generall, who was
in the galley with him, thought not good to make
any stand, till such time as they were within shot of
the Citie, where they might be readie vpon the re∣turne
of Captaine Sampson, to make a sudden at∣tempt
if cause did require before it was darke.</P>
<P>Captaine Sampson returned with his message in
this sort. First, touching peace or warres, the Go∣uernour
sayd he knew of no warres, and that it lay
not in him to make any, he being so meane a sub∣iect
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
as he was. And as for the stay of the Marchants
with their goods, it was the kings pleasure, but not
with intent to endommage any man. And that the
kings conter commandement was (which had bene
receaued in that place some seauennight before)
that English Marchants with their goods should be
discharged: for the more verifying whereof, he
sent such Marchants as were in the towne of our
Nation, who traffiqued those parts: which being at
large declared to our Generall by them, counsell
was taken what might best be done. And for that
the night approched, it was thought needefull to
land our force, which was done in the shutting vp of
the day, &amp; hauing quartered our selues to our most
aduantage, with sufficient gard vpon euery straight,
we thought to rest our selues for that night there.
The Gouernour sent vs some refreshing, as bread,
wine, oyle, apples, grapes, marmalad and such like.
About midnight the weather beginnes to ouercast,
insomuch that it was thought meeter to repaire a∣boord,
then to make any longer abode on land, and
before we could recouer the Fleete, a great tempest
arose, which caused many of our ships to driue from
their ancher hold, and some were forced to sea in
great perill, as the barke Talbot, the barke Hawkins
and the Speedewell, which Speedewell onely was
driuen into England, the others recouered vs a∣gain,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
the extremity of the storme lasted three daies,
which no sooner beganne to asswage, but Maister
Carleill our Lieutenant generall, was sent with his
owne ship and three others: as also with the galley
and with diuers Pinnaces, to see what he might do
aboue VIGO, where he toke many boats and some
Caruels, diuersly laden with things of small value,
but chiefly with houshold stuffe, running into the
high countrey, and amongst the rest, he found one
boate laden with the principall Church stuffe of the
high Church of VIGO, where also was their great
Crosse of siluer, of very faire embossed worke, and
double gilt all ouer, hauing cost them a great masse
of money. They complained to haue lost in all kind
of goods aboue thirtie thowsand Duckets in this
place.</P>
<P>The next day the General with his whole Fleete
went vp frō the Iles of BAYON, to a very good har∣bour
aboue VIGO, where Maister Carleill stayd his
comming, aswell for the more quiet riding of his
ships, as also for the good commoditie of fresh wa∣tering,
which the place there did afoord full well. In
the meane time the Gouernour of GALLISIA had
reared such forces as he might, his numbers by esti∣mate
were some two thowsand foot, and three hun∣dred
horse, &amp; marched from BAYON to this part of
the countrey, which lay in sight of our Fleete, where
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
making stand, he sent to parle with our Generall,
which was graunted by our Generall, so it might be
in boates vpon the water: and for safetie of their
persons, there were pledges deliuered on both
sides, which done, the Gouernor of GALLISIA put
him selfe with two others into our Vize-Admirals
Skiffe, the same hauing bene sent to the shore for
him: And in like sort our General in his own Skiffe,
where by them it was agreed, we should furnish our
selues with fresh water, to be taken by our own peo∣ple
quietly on the land, and haue all other such ne∣cessaries,
paying for the same, as the place would
affoorde.</P>
<P>VVhen all our businesse was ended, we departed,
&amp; toke our way by the Islands of CANARIA, which
are esteemed some three hundred leagues from
this part of Sapin, &amp; falling purposely with PALMA,
with intention to haue taken our pleasure of that
place, for the full digesting of many things into or∣der,
and the better funishing our store with such se∣uerall
good things as that affoordeth very abun∣dantly,
we were forced by the vile sea gate, which
at that present fell out, and by the naughtinesse of
the landing place, being but one, and that vnder the
fauor of many Platformes, well furnished with great
ordinance, to depart with the receipt of many their
Canon shot, some into our ships, and some besides,
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
some of them being in very deede full Canon high.
But the onely or chiefe mischiefe, was the daunge∣rous
sea surge, which at shore all alongest, plainly
threatned the ouerthrow of as many Pinnaces and
boates, as for that time should haue attempted any
landing at all.</P>
<P>Now seeing the expectation of this attempt fru∣strated
by the causes aforesaid, we thought it mee∣ter
to fal with the Isle FERRO, to see if we could find
any better fortune, and comming to the Island, we
landed a thousand men in a valley vnder a high
mountaine, where we stayed some two or three
houres, in which time the inhabitants, accompanied
with a yong fellow borne in England, who dwelt
there with them, came vnto vs, shewing their state
to be so poore, that they were all readie to starue,
which was not vntrue: and therefore without any
thing gotten, we were all commaunded presently
to imbarke, so as that night we put off to sea South
Southeast along towards the coast of Barbarie.</P>
<P>Vpon Saterday in the morning, being the thir∣teenth
of Nouember, we fell with Cape Blancke,
which is a low land &amp; shallow water, where we cat∣ched
store of fish, &amp; doubling the Cape, we put into
the Bay, where we found certain Frēch ships of war,
whom we entertained with great curtesie, and there
left them. The after noone the whole Fleete assem∣bled,

which was a litle scattered about their fishing,
&amp; put frō thence to the Isles of Cape Verde, sayling
till the sixteenth of the same moneth in the mor∣ning,
on which day we descried the Island of S. IAGO,
and in the euening we anckered the Fleet betwene
the towne called the PRAY or PRAY and S. IAGO,
where we put on shore a thousand men or more,
vnder the leading of Maister Christopher Carleill
Lieutenant Generall, who directed the seruice most
like a wise commaunder. The place where we had
first to march did affoord no good order, for the
ground was mountaines and full of dales, being a
maruellous stonie &amp; troublesome passage, but such
was his industrious disposition, as he would neuer
leaue, vntil we had gotten vp to a faire plaine, where
we made stand for the assembling of the Army. And
when we were all gathered together vpō the plaine,
some two litle miles from the towne, the Lieute∣nant
generall thought good not to make attempt
till day light: because there was not one that could
serue for guide or giuing knowledge at all of the
place. And therefore after hauing well rested, euen
halfe an houre before day, he commanded the Ar∣mie
to be deuided into three speciall parts, such as
he appointed, whereas before we had marched by
seuerall companies, being thereunto forced by the
naughtinesse of the way as is aforesayd.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Now by the time we were thus raunged into a
very braue order day light began to appeare, and
being aduaunced hard to the wall, we sawe no ene∣mie
to resist, whereupon the Leiutenant generall
appointed Captaine Sampson with thirtie shot, &amp;
Captaine Barton with other thirtie, to goe downe
into the towne which stood in the valey vnder-vs,
and might verie plainely be veiwed all ouer from
that place where the whole Army was now arriued
&amp; presently after these Captaines was sent the great
Ensigne, which had nothing in it but the plaine En∣glish
Crosse, to be placed towardes the sea, that our
fleet might see Saint Georges Crosse florish in the
enemies fortresse. Order was giuen that all the or∣dinance
througout the towne and vpon all the plat∣formes,
which was aboue fifty peeces all ready char∣ged,
should be shot of in honor of the Queenes Ma∣iesties
coronation day, being the seuententh of No∣uember,
after the yearly custome of England, which
was so answered againe by the ordinance out of all
the ships in the fleete which now was come neere,
as it was straunge to heare such a thondering noise
last so long to gether. In this meane while the Leiu∣tenaunt
generall held still the most part of his force
on the hill top, till such time as the towne was
quartered out for the lodging of the whole armie,
which being done euerie Captaine toke his owne
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
quarter, and in the euening was placed such suffici∣ent
gard vpon euerie part of the towne that we had
no cause to feare any present enemie.</P>
<P>Thus we continued in the citie the space of four∣teene
daies, taking such spoiles as the place yelded,
which were for the most part, wine, oile, meale, and
some other such like things for victuall, as vineger,
oliues &amp; some other trash, as marchandise for their
Indian trades. But there was not found any treasure
at all, or any thing else of worth besides.</P>
<P>The scituation of Sainct IAGO is somwhat strange
in forme like to a triangle, hauing on the East and
VVest sides two mountaines of Rocke and cliffie,
as it were hanging ouer it, vpon the top of which
two mountains was builded certaine fortifications
to preserue the towne from any harme that might
be offered. From thence on the South side of the
towne is the maine sea, and on the North side, the
valley lying betweene the foresayd mountaines,
wherein the towne standeth: the saide valley and
towne both do grow very narrow, insomuch that
the space betweene the two cliffes of this ende of
the towne is estimated not to be aboue tenne or
twelue score ouer.</P>
<P>In the middest of the valley cometh downe a ri∣ueret,
rill, or brooke of fresh water, which hard by
the sea side maketh a pond or poole, whereout our
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
ships were watered with very great ease and plea∣sure.
Somewhat aboue the towne on the North side
betweene the two mountaines, the valley wageth
somewhat larger then at the townes end, which val∣ley
is wholie conuerted into gardens and orchards
well replenished with diuers sorts of fruicts, herbes
&amp; trees, as lymmons, oranges, suger canes, cochars
or cochos nuts, plantens, potato roots, cocombers,
small and round onions, garlicke, and some other
things not now remembred, amongst which the co∣chos
nuts and plantens are very pleasant fruicts, the
sayd cochos hauing a hard shell and a greene huske
ouer it, as hath our walnut, but it farre exceedeth in
greatnesse, for this cochos in this greene huske is
bigger then any mans two fistes, of the hard shell
many drinking cups are made here in England, and
set in siluer as I haue often seene.</P>
<P>Next within this hard shell is a white rine resem∣bling
in shew very much euen as any thing may do,
to the white of an egge when it is hard boyled. And
within this white of the nut lyeth a water, which is
whitish and very cleere, to the quantitie of halfe a
pint or thereabouts, which water and white rine be∣fore
spoken of, are both of a very coole fresh taste,
and as pleasing as any thing may be. I haue heard
some hold opinion, that it is very restoratiue.</P>
<P>The Planten groweth in cods, somewhat like to
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
beanes, but is bigger and longer, and much more
thicke together on the stalke, and when it waxeth
ripe, the meate which filleth the rine of the cod be∣commeth
yellow, and is exceeding sweet and plea∣sant.</P>
<P>In this time of our being there, hapned to come
a Portingall to the VVestermost fort, with a flag of
truce, to whom Captaine Sampson was sent with
Captaine Goring, who comming to the sayd Mes∣senger,
he first asked them what nation they were,
they aunswered Englishmen, he then required to
know if warres were betweene England &amp; Spaine,
to which they answered that they knew not, but if
he would go to their Generall he could best resolue
him of such particulars, and for his assurance of pas∣sage
and repassage, these Captaines made offer to
ingage their credits, which he refused for that he
was not sent from his Gouernor. Then they tolde
him, if his Gouernor did desire to take a course for
the common benefit of the people and contrie, his
best way were to come &amp; present himselfe vnto our
Noble and merciful Gouernor Sir Frances Drake:
whereby he might be assured to finde fauour, both
for him selfe and the inhabitants. Otherwise within
three daies we should march ouer the land, and con∣sume
with fire all inhabited places, and put to the
sworde all such liuing soules as we should chaunce
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
vpon: so thus much he tooke for the conclusion of
his answer, and departing, he promised to returne
the next day, but we neuer heard more of him.</P>
<P>Vpon the foure and twentieth of Nouember, the
Generall accompanied with the Lieutenant gene∣rall
and six hundred men, marched foorth to a vil∣lage
twelue miles within the lande, called S. DO∣MINGO,
where the Gouernor and the Bishop with
all the better sort were lodged, and by eight of the
clocke we came to it, finding the place abandoned,
&amp; the people fled into the mountaines: so we made
stande a while to ease our selues, and partly to see if
any would come to speake to vs. After we had well
rested our selues, the Generall commaunded the
troupes to march away homewardes, in which re∣treat
the enemy shewed them selues, both horse &amp;
foote, though not such force as durst encounter vs:
and so in passing some time at the gase with them, it
waxed late and towards night, before we could re∣couer
home to S. IAGO.</P>
<P>On Munday the six &amp; twentieth of Nouember,
the Generall commanded all the Pinnaces with the
boates, to vse all diligence to imbarke the Armie
into such ships as euery man belonged. The Lieute∣nant
generall in like sort commaunded Captaine
Goring and Lieutenant Tucker, with one hundred
shot to make a stand in the market place, vntill our

<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
forces were wholly imbarked, the Vizeadmirall
making stay with his Pinnace and certaine boates
in the harbour, to bring the sayd last company a∣boord
the ships. Also the Generall willed foorth∣with
the Gallie with two Pinnaces to take into thē
the company of Captaine Barton, and the compa∣ny
of Captaine Bigs, vnder the leading of Captaine
Sampson, to seeke out such munition as was hidden
in the ground, at the towne of PRAY or PLAY, ha∣uing
beene promised to be shewed it by a prisoner,
which was taken the day before. The Captaines a∣foresaid
comming to the PLAY, landed their men,
and hauing placed the troupe in their best strength,
Captaine Sampson tooke the prisoner, and willed
him to shewe that he had promised, the which he
could not, or at least would not: but they searching
all suspected places, found two pieces of ordinance
one of yron, an other of brasse. In the after noone
the Generall anckered the rest of the Fleete before
the PLAY, comming him selfe a shore, willing vs to
burne the towne and make all haste a boorde, the
which was done by sixe of the clocke the same day,
and our selues imbarked againe the same night, and
so we put off to sea Southwest.</P>
<P>But before our departure from the towne of S.
IAGO, we established orders for the better gouern∣ment
of the armie, euery man mustered to his Cape∣taine,
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ministred to acknowledge her Ma∣iestie
supreame Gouernour, as also euery man to
do his vttermost endeuour to aduaunce the seruice
of the action, and to yeeld due obedience vnto the
directions of the Generall and his officers. By this
prouident counsell, and laying downe this good
foundation before hand, all things went forward
in a due course, to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chiuing of our happie en∣terprise.</P>
<P>In all the time of our being here, neither the Go∣uernor
for the king of Spaine, which is a Portingall,
neither the Bishop, whose authoritie is great, nei∣ther
any of the inhabitants of the towne or Island e∣uer
came at vs (which we expectected they should
haue done) to intreate vs to leaue them some part
of their needefull prouisions, or at the least, to spare
the ruining of their towne at the going away. The
cause of this their vnreasonable distrust (as I do take
it) was the fresh remembrance of the great wrongs
they had done to olde Maister VVilliam Hawkins
of Plimouth, in the voyage he made fower or fiue
yeares before, when as they did both breake their
promise, and murdered many of his men, whereof
I iudge you haue vnderstood, and therefore neede∣lesse
to be here repeated. But since they came not
at vs, we left written in sundry places, as also in the
Spitle house (which building was onely appointed
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
to be spared) the great discontentment and scorne
we tooke at this their refraining to come vnto vs, as
also at the rude maner of killing, and sauage kind of
handling the dead body of one of our boyes, found
by them stragling all alone, from whom they had
taken his head and his heart, and had stragled the
other bowels about the place, in a most brutish and
most beastly maner.</P>
<P>In reuenge whereof at our departing we consu∣med
with fire all the houses, aswell in the countrey
which we sawe, as in the towne of S. IAGO.</P>
<P>From hence putting ouer to the VVest Indies,
we were not many dayes at sea, but there beganne
amongst our people such mortalitie, as in few daies
there were dead aboue two or three hundred men.
And vntil some seuen or eight dayes after our com∣ming
from S. IAGO, there had not died anie one
man of sickenesse in all the Fleete: the sickenesse
shewed not his infection wherewith so many were
stroken, vntill we were departed thence, and then
seazed our people with extreme hote burning and
continuall ague, whereof some verie fevve escaped

strength for a long time after. In some that dyed

<PB N="20" REF="17"/>
plague, we were not aboue eighteene daies in pas∣sage
betweene the sight of Sainct IAGO aforesaid,
and the Island of DOMINICA, being the first Island
of the VVest Indies that we fell withall, the same be∣ing
inhabited with sauage people, which goe all na∣ked,
their skin couloured with some painting of a
reddish tawney, verie personable and handsome
strong men, who doe admit little conuersation with
the Spaniards: for as some of our people might vn∣derstand
them, they had a Spaniard or twaine priso∣ners
with them, neither doe I thinke that there is a∣ny
safety for any of our nation, or any other to be
within the limits of their commaundement, albeit
they vsed vs very kindely for those fewe houres of
time which we spent with them, helping our folkes
to fill and carie on their bare shoulders fresh water
from the riuer to our ships boats, and fetching from
their houses, great store of Tobacco, as also a kinde
of bread, which they fed on, called Cassado, verie
white and sauerie, made of the rootes of Cassania.
In recompence whereof, we bestowed liberali re∣wardes
of glasse, coloured beades and other things,
which we had found at Sainct IAGO, wherewith (as
it seemed) they rested very greatly satisfied, and
shewing some sorowfull countenance when they
perceaued that we would depart.</P>
<P>From hence we went to another Island VVest∣ward
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>
of it, called Sainct CHRISTOPHERS Island,
wherein we spent some dayes of Christmas, to re∣fresh
our sicke people, and to cleanse and aire our
ships. In which Island were not any people at all that
we could heare of.</P>
<P>In which time by the General it was aduised and
resolued, with the consent of the Lieutenant gene∣rall,
the Vizeadmirall, and all the rest of the Cap∣taines
to proceede to the great Island of HISPA∣NIOLA,
as well for that we knewe our selues then
to be in our best strength, as also the rather allured
thereunto, by the glorious fame of the Citie of S.
DOMINGO, being the auncientest and chiefe inha∣bited
place in all that tract of country there abouts.
And so proceeding in this determination, by the
way we met with a small Frigot, bound for the same
place, the which the Vizeadmirall tooke, and ha∣uing
duly examined the men that were in her, there
was one found by whom we were aduertised, the
hauen to be a barred hauen, and the shore or lande
thereof to be well fortified, hauing a Castle there∣vpon
furnished with great store of artillerie, with∣out
the daunger whereof, was no conuenient lan∣ding
place with ten English miles of the Citie, to
which the sayd Pilote tooke on him to conduct vs.</P>
<P>All things being thus considered on, the whole
forces were commaunded in the euening to im∣barke
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>
them selues into Pinnaces, boates, and other
small barkes appointed for this seruice. Our soul∣diers
being thus imbarked, the Generall put him
selfe into the barke Fraunces as Admirall, and all
this night we lay on the sea, bearing small saile vntil
our arriuall to the landing place, which was about
the breaking of the day, and so we landed, being
New yeares day, nine or tenne miles to the VVest∣wardes
of that braue Citie of S. DOMINGO: for at
that time nor yet is known to vs, any landing place,
where the sea surge doth not threaten to ouerset a
Pinnace or boate. Our Generall hauing seene vs all
landed in safetie, returned to his Fleete, bequea∣thing
vs to God, and the good conduct of Maister
Carleill our Lieutenant generall, at which time, be∣ing
about eight of the clocke, we began to march,
and about noone time, or towards one of the clock
we approched the towne, where the Gentlemen
and those of the better sorte, being some hundred
and fiftie braue horses or rather more, began to pre∣sent
them selues, but our small shot played vpon
them, which were so sustained with good propor∣tion
of pikes in all partes, as they finding no part of
our troope vnprepared to receaue them (for you
must vnderstand they viewed all round about) they
were thus driuen to giue vs leaue to proceede to∣wardes
the two gates of the towne, which were the
<PB N="23" REF="18"/>
next to the seaward. They had manned them both,
and planted their ordinance for that present and
sudden alarum without the gates, and also some
troopes of small shot in Ambuscado vpon the high
way side. VVe deuided our whole force, being
some thousand or twelue hundred men into two
partes, to enterprise both the gates at one instant,
the Lieutenant generall hauing openly vowed to
Captaine Powell (who led the troope that entred
by the other gate) that with Gods good fauour he
would not rest vntill our meeting in the market
place.</P>
<P>Their ordinance had no sooner discharged vp∣on
our neere approche, and made some execution
amongest vs, though not much, but the Leiutenant
generall beganne forthwith to aduaunce both his
voice of encoragment and pase of marching, the
first man that was slaine with the ordinaunce being
verie neere vnto him selfe, and thereupon hasted
all that he might to keepe them from the reaching
of the ordinaunce. And notwithstanding their Am∣buscadoes,
we marched or rather ranne soe roundly
into them, as pell mell we entered the gates with
them, and gaue them more care euerie man to saue
himselfe by flight, then reason to stand any longer
to their broken fight, we forthwith repaired to the
market place, but to be more truely vnderstood
<PB N="24" REF="19"/>
a place of very faire spatious square ground before
the great Church, whither also came as had beene
agreed, Captaine Powell with the other troope,
which place with some part next vnto it we streng∣thened
with Barricados, &amp; there as the most conue∣nient
place assured our selues, the Citie being farre
too spatious for so small and wearie a troope to vn∣dertake
to gard. Somwhat after midnight they who
had the gard of the Castle, hearing vs busie about
the gates of the said Castle, abandoned the same,
some being taken prisoners, and some flying away
by the helpe of boates, to the other side of the ha∣uen,
and soe into the countrey.</P>
<P>The next day we quartered alitle more at large,
but not in the halfe part of the towne, and so ma∣king
substantiall trenches, and planting all the ordi∣naunce,
that each parte was correspondent to o∣ther,
we held this towne the space of one moneth.</P>
<P>In the which time hapned some accidents more
then are well remembred for the present, but a∣mongest
other thinges it chaunced that the Gene∣rall
sent on his message to the Spaniardes a negro
boy with a flagge of white, signifying truce as is the
Spaniards ordinarie maner to do there, when they
approch to speake with vs, which boy vnhappily
was first met withal, by some of those who had bene
belonging as officers for the king in the Spanish
<PB N="25" REF="19"/>
galley, which with the towne was lately fallen into
our hands, who without all order or reason, &amp; con∣trary
to that good vsage wherewith we had enter∣tained
their messengers, furiouslie stroke the poore
boy through the body with one of their horsemens
staues, with which wound the boy returned to the
Generall, and after he had declared the maner of
this wrongfull crueltie, died forthwith in his pre∣sence,
wherewith the Generall being greatly passio∣ned,
commanded the Prouost martiall, to cause a
couple of Friers, then prisoners, to be caried to the
same place where the boy was stroken, accompa∣nied
with sufficient gard of our souldiers, and there
presently to be hanged, dispatching at the same in∣stant
another poore prisoner, with this reason wher∣fore
this execution was done, and with this message
further, that vntill the partie who had thus murthe∣red
the Generals messenger, were deliuered into
our hands, to receaue condigne punishment, there
should no day passe, wherein there should not two
prisoners be hanged, vntill they were all consumed
which were in our hands.</P>
<P>VVhereupon the day folowing, he that had bene
Captaine of the kings galley, brought the offendor
to the townes ende, offring to deliuer him into our
hands, but it was thought a more honourable re∣uenge,
to make them there in our sight, to performe
<PB N="26" REF="20"/>
the execution them selues, which was done ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>During our being in this towne, as formerly also
at S. IAGO there had passed iustice vpon the life of
one of our owne companie for an odious matter: so
here likewise was there an Irish man hanged, for
the murthering of his Corporall.</P>
<P>In this time also passed many treaties betweene
their commissioners and vs, for ransome of their Ci∣tie,
but vpon disagreements, we still spent the early
mornings in firing the outmost houses: but they
being built very magnificently of stone, with high
loftes, gaue vs no small trauell to ruine them. And
albeit for diuers dayes together, we ordained eche
morning by day breake, vntill the heate began at
nine of the clocke, that two hundred mariners did
nought else but labour to fier and burne the sayd
houses without our trenches, whilest the souldiers
in a like proportion stood foorth for their gard: yet
did we not or could not in this time consume so
much as one third part of the towne. And so in the
end, what wearied with firing, and what hastened by
some other respects, we were content to accept of
fiue and twentie thousand Duckets, of fiue shillings
sixe pence the peece, for the raunsome of the rest of
the towne. Amongst other things which happened
and were found at S. DOMINGO, I may not omit to
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>
let the world know one very notable marke and to∣ken,
of the vnsatiable ambition of the Spanish King
and his nation, which was found in the kings house,
wherein the chiefe Gouernour of that Citie and
countrey is appointed always to lodge, which was
this. In the comming to the hall or other roomes of
this house, you must first ascend vp by a faire large
paire of staires, at the head of which staires is a hand∣some
spatious place to walke in, somewhat like vn∣to
a gallerie, wherein vpon one of the walles, right
ouer against you as you enter the sayd place, so as
your eye cā not escape the sight of it, there is descri∣bed
&amp; painted in a very large Scutchion, the armes
of the king of Spaine, &amp; in the lower part of the said
Scutchion, there is likewise described a globe, con∣taining
in it the whole circuite of the sea and the
earth, whereupon is a horse standing on his hinder
part within the globe, and the other fore part with∣out
the globe, lifted vp as it were to leape, with a
scroll painted in his mouth, wherein was written
these wordes in Latin NON SVFFICIT ORBIS:
which is as much to say, as the world suffiseth not,
whereof the meaning was required to be knowne
of some of those of the better sort, that came in com∣mission
to treate vpon the ransome of the towne,
who would shake their heads, and turne aside their
countenance in some smiling sort, without aunswe∣ring
<PB N="28" REF="21"/>
any thing, as greatly ashamed thereof. For by
some of our companie it was told them, that if the
Queene of England would resolutely prosecute the
warres against the king of Spaine, he should be for∣ced
to lay aside that proude and vnreasonable rea∣ching
vaine of his, for he should finde more then
inough to do, to keepe that which he had alreadie,
as by the present example of their lost towne they
might for a beginning perceaue well inough.</P>
<P>Now to the satisfying of some men, who maruell
greatly that such a famous &amp; goodly builded Citie
so wel inhabited of gallant people, very brauely ap∣parelled
(whereof our souldiers found good store
for their reliefe) should afoord no greater riches
then was found there, wherein it is to be vnderstood
that the Indian people, which were the naturals of
this whole Island of HISPANIOLA (the same being
neare hand as great as England) were many yeares
since cleane consumed by the tyrannie of the Spa∣niards,
which was cause, that for lacke of people to
worke in the Mines, the gold &amp; siluer Mines of this
Island are wholie giuen ouer, and thereby they are
faine in this Island to vse copper money, whereof
was found verie great quantitie. The chiefe trade of
this place consisteth of suger &amp; ginger, which grow∣eth
in the Island, and of hides of oxen and kine,
which in this wast countrey of the Island are bred

in infinite numbers, the soile being very fertile: and
the said beasts are fed vp to a very large growth, &amp;
so killed for nothing so much, as for their hides a∣foresaid.
VVe found here great store of strong wine,
sweete oyle, vineger, oliues and other such like pro∣uisions,
as excellent wheate meale packed vp in
wine pipes and other caske, and other commodi∣ties
likewise, as wollen and linnen cloth, and some
silkes, all which prouisions are brought out of Spain
and serued vs for great releefe. There was but litle
plate or vessell of siluer, in comparison of the great
pride in other things of this towne, because in these
hote countreyes they vse much of these earthen di∣shes
finely painted or varnished, which they call
Parsellina, and is had out of the East India, and for
their drinking, they vse glasses altogether, whereof
they make excellent good and faire in the same
place. But yet some plate we found, and many other
good things, as their houshold garniture very gal∣lant
and rich, which had cost them deare, although
vnto vs they were of small importance.</P>
<P>From S. DOMINGO we put ouer to the maine
or firme land, and going all alongest the coast, we
came at the last in sight of CARTAGENA, standing
vpon the sea side, so neare as some of our barkes in
passing alongest, approched within the reach of
their Culuerin shot, which they had planted vpon
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
certaine platformes. The harbour mouth lay some
fiue miles to the VVestward of the towne, wherinto
we entred about three or foure of the clocke in the
after noone without any resistance, or ordinance or
other impeachment planted vpon the same. In the
euening we put our selues on land towards the har∣bour
mouth, vnder the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of Maister Carleill
our Lieutenant generall, who after he had digested
vs to march forward about the midnight, as easily
as foot might fall, expressely commanding to keepe
close by the sea wash of the shore for our best and
surest way, whereby we were like to go through, and
not to misse any more of the way, which once we
had lost within an hower after our first beginning to
march, through the slender knowledge of him that
toke vpō him to be our guide, wherby the night spēt
on, which otherwise must haue bene done by re∣sting.
But as we came within two miles of the town,
their horsemen which were some hundred, met vs,
and taking the Alarum, retired to their towneward
againe vpon the first volley of our shot that was gi∣uen
them: for the place where we encountred being
woodie and bushie euen to the water side, was vn∣meete
for their seruice.</P>
<P>At this instant we might heare some peeces of
artillerie discharged, with diuers small shot towards
the harbour, which gaue vs to vnderstand, accor∣ding
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>
to the order set downe in the euening before
by our Generall, that the Vizeadmirall accompa∣nied
with Captaine Venner, Captaine VVhite, and
Captaine Crosse, with other sea Captaines, and
with diuers Pinnaces and boates should giue some
attempt vnto the litle fort standing on the entrie of
the inner hauen, neare adioyning to the towne,
though to small purpose, for that the place was
strong, and the entrie very narrow was chained o∣uer:
so as there could be nothing gotten by that at∣tempt,
more then the giuing them an Alarum on
that other side of the hauen, being a mile or two
from the place where we nowe were. In which at∣tempt
the Vizeadmirall had the rudder of his Skiffe
stroken through with a Saker shot, and litle or no
harme receaued elsewhere.</P>
<P>The troopes being nowe in their march halfe a
mile behither the towne or lesse, the ground we
were on grewe to be straight, and not aboue fiftie
pases ouer, hauing the maine sea on the one side of
it, and the harbour water or inner sea (as you may
tearme it) on the other side. This straight was forti∣fied
cleane ouer with a stone wall and a ditch with∣out
it, the said wall being as orderly built with flan∣king
in euery part, as can be set downe. There was
onely so much of this straight vnwalled, as might
serue for the issuing of the horsemen, or the passing
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>
of cariage in time of neede: but this vnwalled part
was not without a very good Barricado of wine
buts or pipes, filled with earth, full and thick as they
might stand on end one by other some part of them
standing euen within the maine sea.</P>
<P>This place of strength was furnished of sixe great
peeces, demi-Culuerins and Sakers, which shot di∣rectly
in front vpon vs as vve approched. Novve
without this wall vpon the inner side of the straight,
they had brought likewise two great gallies with
their prowesse to the shore, hauing planted in them
eleuen peeces of ordināce which did beat all crosse
the straight, and flanked our comming on. In these
two galleyes wered planted three or foure hundred
small shot, and on the land in the gard onely of this
place three hundred shot and pikes.</P>
<P>They in this their full readinesse to receaue vs,
spared not their shot both great and small. But our
Lieutenant generall, taking the aduantage of the
darke (the day light as yet not broken out) ap∣proched
by the lowest ground, according to the
expresse direction which him selfe had formerly gi∣uen,
the same being the sea wash shore, where the
water was somewhat fallen, so as most of all their
shot was in vaine. Our Lieutenant generall com∣maunded
our shot to forbeare shooting vntill we
were come to the wall si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, &amp; so with pikes roundly
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>
together we approched the place, where we soone
found out the Barricadoes of pipes or buts, to be
the meetest place for our assault, which notwithstan∣ding
it was well furnished with pikes and shot, was
without staying attempted by vs: downe went the
buts of earth, and pell mell came our swordes and
pikes together, after our shot had first giuen their
volley, euen at the enemies nose. Our pikes were
somewhat longer then theirs, and our bodies better
armed, for very fewe of them were armed, with
which aduantage our swordes and pikes grewe to
hard for them, and they driuen to giue place. In
this furious entrie, the Lieutenant generall slue with
his owne hands, the chief ensigne bearer of the Spa∣niards,
who fought very manfully to his liues end.</P>
<P>VVe followed into the towne with them, and gi∣uing
them no leasure to breath, we wanne the mar∣ket
place, albeit they made head, and fought a while
before we got it, and so we being once seazed and
assured of that, they were content to suffer vs to
lodge within their towne, and them selues to go to
their wiues, whom they had caried into other pla∣ces
of the countrey before our comming thither.</P>
<P>At euerie streetes end they had raised very fine
Barricadoes of earth workes, with trenches without
them, as well made as euer we saw any worke done:
at the entring whereof was some litle resistance, but
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>
soone ouercome, it was with few slaine or hurt. They
had ioyned with them many Indians, whom they
had placed in corners of aduantage, all bowe men,
with their arrowes most villanously empoisoned, so
as if they did but breake the skinne, the partie so
touched died without great maruell: some they slue
of our people with their arrowes, some they likewise
mischieued to death with certaine prickes or small
stickes sharply pointed, of a foote and a halfe long,
the one end put into the ground, the other empoi∣soned,
sticking fast vp, right against our comming
in the way, as we should approch from our landing
towardes the towne, whereof they had planted a
wonderfull number in the ordinarie way, but our
keeping the sea wash shore, missed the greatest part
of them very happily.</P>
<P>To ouerpasse many particular matters, as the
hurting of Captaine Sampson at sword blowes in
the first entring, vnto whom was committed the
charge of the pikes of the Vantgard by his lot and
turne, as also of the taking of Alonso Brauo the
chiefe commander of that place by Captaine Go∣ring,
after the sayd Captaine had first hurt him with
his sword, vnto which Captaine was committed the
charge of the shot of the said Vantgard.</P>
<P>Captaine VVinter was likewise by his turne of
the Vantgard in this attempt, where also the Lieute∣nant
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
generall marched him selfe, the sayd Captaine
VVinter through a great desire to serue by land, ha∣uing
now exchaunged his charge by sea with Cap∣taine
Cecill for his band of footemen.</P>
<P>Captaine Powell the Sergeant maior had by his
turne, the charge of the foure companies which
made the battaile.</P>
<P>Captaine Morgan, who at S. DOMINGO was of
the Vantgard, had nowe by turne his charge vpon
the companies of the Riergard.</P>
<P>Euerie man aswell of one part as of another,
came so willingly on to the seruice, as the enemie
was not able to endure the furie of such hote assault.
VVe stayed here sixe weekes, &amp; the sickenesse with
mortality before spoken of, still continuing among
vs, though not with the same furie as at the first, and
such as were touched with the said sickenesse, esca∣ping
death, very few or none almost could recouer
againe their strength, yea many of them were much
decayed in their memorie, insomuch that it was
grovven an ordinarie iudgement, vvhen one vvas
heard to speake foolishly, to say he had bene sicke
of the Calentour, vvhich is the Spanish name of
their burning ague: for as I told you before, it is a
verie burning &amp; pestilent ague. The originall cause
thereof, is imputed to the euening or first night aire
which they tearme La serena, vvherein they say and
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>
hold very firme opinion, that who so is then abroad
in the open aire, shall certainly be infected to the
death, not being of the Indian or naturall race of
those countrey people: our people by holding their
watch, were thus subiected to the infectious aire,
which at S. IAGO was most daungerous and dead∣ly
of all other places.</P>
<P>VVith this incōuenience of continuall mortality,
we were forced to giue ouer our intēded enterprise,
to go with NOMBRE DE DIOS, and so ouerland
to PANNANIA, where we shoulde haue stroken
the stroke for the treasure, and full recompence of
our tediouse trauailes. And thus at CARTAGENA
we toke our first resolution to returne homewards.</P>
<P>But while we were yet there, it happened one
day, that our watch called the Sentinell, vpon the
Church steeple, had discouered in the sea a couple
of small barkes or boates, making in with the har∣bour
of CARTAGENA, wherepō Captaine Moone
and Captaine Varney, with Iohn Grant the Maister
of the Tyger, and some other seamen, embarqued
them selues in a couple of small Pinnaces, to take
them before they should come neare the shore, at
the mouth of the harbour, lest by some stragling
Spaniards from the land, they might be warned by
signes from cōming in, which fell out accordingly,
notwithstāding al the diligence that our men could
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>
vse: for the Spanish boates, vpon the sight of our
Pinnaces comming towards them, ran themselues
a shore, and so their men presently hid them selues
in the bushes hard by the sea side, amongest some
others that had called them by signes thither. Our
men presently without any due regard had to the
qualitie of the place, and seeing no man of the Spa∣niards
to shew them selues, aboorded the Spanish
barkes or boates, and so standing all open in them,
were suddenly shot at by a troope of Spaniards out
of the bushes, by which volley of shot there were
slaine Captaine Varney, who died presently, and
Captaine Moone, who died some fewe dayes after,
besides some foure or fiue others that were hurt: &amp;
so our folkes returned without their purpose, not
hauing anie sufficient number of souldiers, with
them to fight on shore. For those men they carried
were all marriners to rowe, fewe of them armed, be∣cause
they made accompt with their ordinance to
haue taken the barks well inough at sea, which they
might full easily haue done, without any losse at all,
if they had come in time to the harbour mouth, be∣fore
the Spaniards boates had gotten so neare the
shore.</P>
<P>During our abode in this place, as also a S. DO∣MINGO,
there passed diuerse curtesies betweene vs
and the Spaniards, as feasting, and vsing them with
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>
all kindnesse and fauour: so as amongst others there
came to see the Generall, the Gouernour of CAR∣TAGENA,
with the Bishop of the same, and diuerse
other Gentlemen of the better sort.</P>
<P>This towne of CARTAGENA we touched in the
out parts, and consumed much with fire, as we had
done S. DOMINGO vpon discontentments, and
for want of agreeing with vs in their first treaties
touching their ransome, which at the last was con∣cluded
betweene vs, should be a hundred and ten
thousand Duckets for that which was yet standing,
the Ducket valued at fiue shillings sixe pence ster∣linge.</P>
<P>This towne (though not halfe so bigge as S. DO∣MINGO)
giues as you see, a farre greater ransome,
being in very deede of farre more importance, by
reason of the excellencie of the harbour, and the fit
situation thereof, to serue the trade of NOMBRE
DE DIOS and other places, and is inhabited with
farre more rich merchants. The other is chiefly in∣habited
with Lawyers and braue Gentlemen, being
the chiefe or highest appeale of their sutes in law of
all the Islands about it, and of the maine land coast
next vnto it. And it is of no such accompt as CAR∣TAGENA,
for these and some other like reasons,
which I could giue you, ouer long to be now writtē.</P>
<P>The warning which this towne receaued of our
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
comming towards them, from S. DOMINGO, by
the space of twentie dayes before our ariuall hither,
was cause that they had both fortified &amp; euery way
prepared for their best defence. As also that they
had caried &amp; conueyed away all their treasure and
principall substance.</P>
<P>The ransome of an hundred and ten thousand
Duckets thus concluded on, as is aforesayd, the
same being written, &amp; expressing for nothing more
then the towne of CARTAGENA, vpon the paiment
of the sayd ransome, we left the sayd towne, and
drewe some part of our souldiers into the Priorie or
Abbey, standing a quarter of an English mile be∣lowe
the towne vpon the harbour water side, the
same being walled with a wall of stone, which we
told the Spaniards was yet ours, and not redeemed
by their composition: where upon they finding the
defect of their contract, were content to enter into
onother raunsome for all places, but specially for
the sayd house, as also the blocke house or Castle,
which is vpon the mouth of the inner harbour. And
when we asked as much for the one as for the other,
they yeelded to giue a thousand crownes for the
Abbey, leauing vs to take our pleasure vpon the
blocke house, which they sayd they were not able
to raunsome, hauing stretched them selues to the
vttermost of their powers: and therefore the sayd
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>
blocke house was by vs vndermined, and so with
gun pouder blowen vp in peeces.</P>
<P>VVhile this latter contract was in making, our
whole Fleete of ships fell downe towards the har∣bour
mouth, where they ankered the third time, &amp;
employed their men in fetching of fresh water a∣boord
the ships for our voyage homewardes, which
water was had in a great well, that is in the Island by
the harbour mouth, which Island is a verie pleasant
place as hath bene seene, hauing in it manie sorts of
goodly and very pleasant fruits, as the orenge trees
and others, being set orderly in walkes of great
length together. Insomuch as the whole Island be∣ing
some two or three miles about, is cast into
groundes of gardening and orchards.</P>
<P>After sixe weekes abode in this place, we put to
sea the last of March, where after two or three dayes
a great ship which we had taken at S. DOMINGO,
and thereupon was called the New yeares gift, fell
into a great leake, being laden with ordināce, hides,
and other spoiles, and in the night she lost the com∣panie
of our Fleete, which being missed the next
morning by the Generall, he cast about with the
whole Fleete, fearing some great mischaunce to be
happened vnto her, as in verie deede it so fell out,
for her leake was so great, and her men were all ty∣red
with pomping. But at the last hauing found her
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>
and the Barke Talbot in her companie, which stay∣ing
by great hap with her, was readie to take their
men out of her, for the sauing of them. And so the
Generall being fully aduertised of their great extre∣mitie,
made saile directly backe againe to CARTA∣GENA
with the whole Fleete, where hauing stayed
eight or tenne dayes more, about the vnlading of
this ship, and the bestowing thereof and her men,
into other ships, we departed once againe to sea,
directing our course towards the Cape S. ANTHO∣NIE,
being the Eastermost part of CVBA, whither
we arriued the seuen &amp; twentieth of Aprill. But be∣cause
fresh water could not presently be found, we
weyed anker and departed, thinking in fewe dayes
to recouer the MATTANCES, a place to the East∣ward
of HAVANA.</P>
<P>After we had sailed some fourteene dayes, we
were brought to Cape S. ANTHONIE againe, tho∣rough
lacke of fauorable wind: but thē our scarsitie
was growen such, as neede made vs looke a litle
better for water, which we found in sufficient quan∣titie,
being in deede, as I iudge, none other then
raine water newly fallen, and gathered vp by ma∣king
pittes in a plot of marrish ground, some three
hundred pases from the sea side.</P>
<P>I do wrong if I should forget the good example
of the Generall at this place, who to encourage
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>
others, and to hasten the getting of fresh water a∣boord
the ships, tooke no lesse paine him selfe then
the meanest, as also at S. DOMINGO, CARTAGENA
and all other places, hauing alwayes so vigilant a
care and foresight in the good ordering of his fleet,
accompanying them, as it is sayd, with such won∣derfull
trauell of bodie, as doubtlesse had he bene
the meanest person, as he was the chiefest, he had
yet deserued the first place of honour: and no lesse
happie do we accompt him, for being associated
with Maister Carleill his Lieutenant generall, by
whose experience, prudent counsell, and gallant
performance, he atchiued so many and happie en∣terprises
of the warre, by whom also he was verie
greatly assisted, in setting downe the needefull or∣ders,
lawes, and course of iustice, and for the due
administration of the same vpon all occasions.</P>
<P>After three dayes spent in watering our ships, we
departed now the second time from this Cape of S.
ANTHONIE the thirteenth of May, and proceeding
about the Cape of FLORIDA, we neuer touched
anie where, but coasting alongst FLORIDA, and
keeping the shore still in sight, the eight and twen∣tieth
of May early in the morning, we descried on
the shore a place built like a Beacon, which was in
deede a scaffold vpon foure long mastes, raised on
ende for men to discouer to the seaward, being in
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>
the latitude of thirtie degrees, or verie neare there∣unto.
Our Pinnaces manned, and comming to the
shore, we marched vp alongst the riuer side, to see
what place the enemy held there: for none amongst
vs had any knowledge thereof at all.</P>
<P>Here the General tooke occasion to march with
the companies him selfe in person, the Lieutenant
generall hauing the Vantgard, and going a mile vp
or somewhat more by the riuer side, we might di∣scerne
on the other side of the riuer ouer against vs,
a fort, which newly had bene built by the Spaniards,
and some mile or there about aboue the fort, was a
litle towne or village without walles, built of wood∣den
houses: we forthwith prepared to haue ordi∣nance
for the batterie, and one peece was litle
before the euening planted, and the first shot being
made by the Lieutenant generall him selfe at their
Ensigne, strake through the Ensigne, as we after∣wards
vnderstood by a French man, which came
vnto vs from them. One shot more was then made,
which strake the foote of the fort wall, which was all
massiue timber of great trees like mastes. The Lieu∣tenant
generall was determined to passe the riuer
this night with foure companies, and there to lodge
him selfe intrenched as neare the fort, as that he
might play with his muskets and smallest shot vpon
anie that should appeare: and so afterwards to bring
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
and plant the batterie with him, but the helpe of
marriners for that sudden to make trenches could
not be had, which was the cause that this determi∣nation
was remitted vntill the next night.</P>
<P>In the night the Lieutenant general tooke a litle
rowing Skiffe, and halfe a dosen well armed, as
Captaine Morgan, and Captaine Sampson, with
some others besides the rowers, and went to viewe
what gard the enemie kept, as also to take know∣ledge
of the ground. And albeit he went as couertly
as might be, yet the enemy taking the Alarum, grew
fearefull that the whole Force was approching to
the assault, and therefore with all speede abando∣ned
the place after the shooting of some of their
pecces. They thus gone, and he being returned
vnto vs againe, but nothing knowing of their flight
from their fort, forthwith came a French man being
a Phipher (who had bene prisoner with them) in a
litle boate, playing on his phiph the tune of the
Prince of Orenge his song, and being called vnto
by the gard, he tolde them before he put foote out
of the boate, what he was him selfe, and howe the
Spaniards were gone from the sort, offering either
to remaine in hands there, or else to returne to the
place with them that would go.</P>
<P>Vpon this intelligence the Generall, the Lieute∣nant
generall, with some of the Captaines in one
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>
Skiffe, and the Vizeadmirall with some others in
his Skiffe, and two or three Pinnaces furnished of
souldiers with them, put presently ouer towards the
fort, giuing order for the rest of the Pinnaces to fol∣low.
And in our approch, some of the enemie bol∣der
then the rest, hauing stayed behind their com∣panie,
shot off two peeces of ordinance at vs: but
on shore we went, and entred the place without fin∣ding
any man there.</P>
<P>VVhen the day appeared, we found it built all
of timber, the walles being none other then whole
masts or bodies of trees set vpright and close toge∣ther
in maner of a pale, without anie ditch as yet
made, but who intended with some more time, for
they had not as yet finished all their worke, hauing
begun the same some three or fower moneths be∣fore:
so as to say the truth, they had no reason to
keepe it, being subiect both to fier and easie assault.</P>
<P>The platforme whereon the ordinance lay, was
whole bodies of long pine trees, whereof there is
great plentie, layed a crosse one on another, and
some litle earth amongst. There was in it thirteene
or fourreene great peeces of brasse ordinance, and
a chest vnbroken vp, hauing in it the value of some
two thousand pounds sterling, by estimation of the
Kings treasure, to pay the souldiers of that place,
who were a hundred and fiftie men.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="32"/>
The fort thus wonne, which they called S. Iohns
fort, and the day opened, we assayed to go to the
towne, but could not by reason of some riuers and
broken ground which was betweene the two pla∣ces:
and therefore enforced to imbarke againe into
our Pinnaces, we went thither vpō the great maine
riuer, which is called as also the towne by the name
of S. AVGVSTINE.</P>
<P>At our approching to land, there was some that
began to shewe them selues, and to bestowe some
fewe shot vpon vs, but presently withdrewe them
selues. And in their running thus away, the Sergeant
maior finding one of their horses readie sadled and
bridled, tooke the same to follow the chase, and so
ouergoing all his companie, was (by one layed be∣hind
a bush) shot through the head, &amp; falling downe
therewith, was by the same and two or three more,
stabbed in three or foure places of his bodie with
swords and daggers, before anie could come neere
to his reskue. His death was much lamented, being
in verie deede an honest wise Gentleman, and a
souldier of good experience, and of as great cou∣rage
as anie man might be.</P>
<P>In this place called S. AVGVSTINE, we vnder∣stood
the King did keepe as is before said, one hun∣dred
and fiftie souldiers, and at an other place some
dozen leagues beyond to the Northwardes, called

S. HELENA, he did there likewise kepe an hundred
and fiftie more, seruing there for no other purpose,
then to keepe all other nations from inhabiting any
part of all that coast, the gouernement wherof was
committed to one Pedro Melendez Marquesse, ne∣phew
to that Melendez the Admiral, who had ouer∣thrown
Maister Iohn Hawkins in the Bay of MEXI∣CO
some fifteene or sixteene yeares agoe. This Go∣uernour
had charge of both the places, but was at
this time in this place, and one of the first that left
the same.</P>
<P>Here it was resolued in full assemblie of Cap∣taines,
to vndertake the enterprise of S. HELENA,
and from thence to seeke out the inhabitation of
our English countrey men in VIRGINIA, distant
from thence some sixe degrees Northward.</P>
<P>VVhen we came thwart of S. HELENA, the shols
appearing daungerous, and we hauing no Pilot to
vndertake the entrie, it was thought meetest to go
hence alongst. For the Admirall had bene the same
night in foure fadome and halfe three leagues from
the shore: and yet we vnderstood, that by the helpe
of a knowen Pilot, there may and doth go in ships
of greater burthen and draught then anie we had in
our Fleete.</P>
<P>VVe passed thus alongest the coast hard abord
the shore, which is shallow for a league or two from
<PB N="48" REF="35"/>
the shore, and the same is lowe and broken land
for the most part.</P>
<P>The ninth of Iune vpon sight of one speciall great
fire (which are verie ordinarie all alongst this coast,
euen from the Cape FLORIDA hither) the Ge∣nerall
sent his Skiffe to the shore, where they found
some of our English countrey men (that had bene
sent thither the yeare before by Sir VValter Ra∣leigh)
&amp; brought one aboord, by whose direction
we proceeded along to the place, which they make
their Port. But some of our ships being of great
draught vnable to enter, we ankered all without the
harbour in a wild road at sea, about two miles from
shore.</P>
<P>From whence the General wrote letters to Mai∣ster
Rafe Lane, being Gouernour of those English
in VIRGINIA, and then at his fort about six leagues
from the rode in an Island, which they call ROA∣NOAC,
wherein specially he shewed how readie he
was to supply his necessities and wants, which he vn∣derstood
of, by those he had first talked withall.</P>
<P>The morrowe after Maister Lane him selfe and
some of his companie comming vnto him, with the
consent of his Captaines, he gaue them the choise
of two offers, that is to say: Either he would leaue a
ship, a Pinnace, and certaine boates with sufficient
Maisters and mariners, together furnished witha
<PB N="49" REF="35"/>
moneths victuall to stay and make farther discoue∣rie
of the country and coastes, and so much victuall
likewise that might be sufficient for the bringing of
them all (being an hundred and three persons) into
England if they thought good after such time, with
anie other thing they would desire, &amp; that he might
be able to spare.</P>
<P>Or else if they thought they had made sufficient
discouerie alreadie, and did desire to returne into
England, he would giue them passage. But they as
it seemed, being desirous to stay, accepted verie
thankefully, and with great gladnesse that which
was offred first. VVherupon the ship being appoin∣ted
&amp; receaued into charge, by some of their owne
companie sent into her by Maister Lane, before
they had receaued from the rest of the Fleete, the
prouision appointed thē, there arose a great storme
(which they sayde was extraordinarie and verie
straunge) that lasted three dayes together, and
put all our Fleete in great daunger, to be driuen
from their ankering vpon the coast. For we brake
manie Cables, and lost manie ankers. And some of
our Fleete which had lost all (of which number was
the ship appointed for Maister Lane and his com∣panie)
were driuen to put to sea in great danger, in
auoiding the coast, and could neuer see vs againe
vntill we met in England. Manie also of our small
<PB N="50" REF="36"/>
Pinnaces and boates were lost in this storme.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding after all this, the Generall of∣fered
them (with consent of his Captaines) another
ship with some prouision, although not such a one
for their turnes, as might haue bene spared them
before, this being vnable to be brought into their
harbour. Or else if they would, to giue them passage
into England, although he knewe he should per∣forme
it with greater difficultie then he might haue
done before.</P>
<P>But Maister Lane with those of the chiefest of
his companie he had then with him, considering
what should be best for them to doe, made request
vnto the Generall vnder their handes, that they
might haue passage for England: the which being
graunted, and the rest sent for out of the countrey
and shipped, we departed from that coast the eigh∣teenth
of Iune.</P>
<P>And so God be thanked, both they and we in
good safetie arriued at Portesmouth the eight and
twentieth of Iuly 1586. to the great glorie of God,
and to no small honour to our Prince, our countrey
and our selues.</P>
<P>The totall value of that which was gotten in this
voyage, is estimated at three score thousand poūds,
whereof the companies which haue trauelled in the
voyage were to haue twentie thousand pounds, the
