<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM Lord LENTHAL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O repeat your Lord-ships Tytles, and the Merits by which you atchieved them, and your just Administration under them, re∣quires a larger volume then I here pre∣sent you, nor had you received any other demonstration of my duty, till I had pay∣ed it in that kind, could I believe my self fit for so great an enterprize. To contract them into the narrow compass of an Epistle, is a diminution I dare not think of, since no Reader capable of this treatise can be ignorant of more then I could here tell him, should I extend it much beyond the ordinary limits: and Posterity can turn over no leaf in the English History (during our last twenty years transactions) wherein he will not find frequent mention of your Lord-ships name so involved in the principal affaires, that no alteration the Island can suffer (whil'st inhabited by men) can extinguish your memory. A change of language in our Nation by foreign Conquest or confusion like that of <HI>Babel,</HI> would for a short time obscure it; but retained by all other parts of the knowing world in their me∣morials of our stupendious changes, how soon will the next commerce bring it back again? and consecrate your name to the utmost ex∣tent of time. Amidst these considerations I make humble tender of all I can. The Itinerary of <HI>Italy,</HI> translated long after my return thence, in those vacant hours which I allowed to diversion, without farther intention then to renew that language by a re∣translation (which occasioned my so close keeping to the Italian
<PB REF="3"/>
names and Idiome) and once more to travel that celebrate Countrey in this exact description, whither in my earlier years your Lord∣ship addressed me. Taking wing therefore from your Lordships Hand, and persuit from your direction, the Quarry (such as it is) ought to be your Lordships at the retrive; and though perhaps you will not esteem it fit to range in the first course of Books on your Lordships well furnished Table, yet it may deserve a share in the se∣cond, affording a pleasant repast even to those, who require a more substantial meal. To advance that thought a little, and call it <HI>Man∣na</HI> (such in every mans mouth as he best liked) though proper e∣nough to the Countrey where it abounds in great perfection, and agreeable to this work, where all appetites, all tasts, may be delight∣ed, would perhaps appear arrogance in me, who deliver it not pure from the tree (on which it falls) but as from an Apothecaries shop, where it may have received some taint. Yet those imper∣fections your Lordship will pardon, and for your Lordships sake this Nation, (at least in some measure) because devoted to you up∣on the score of publique gratitude as well as the particular obli∣gation, of</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU have here the Itinerary of <HI>Italy,</HI> a guide to all that tra∣vel thither, a memorial after their return, a just entertain∣ment to the learned, &amp; a plea∣sing diversion to those who have not given themselves the trouble of un∣necessarie letters; whilst with easie Journies they pass through the most celebrate part of the habitable Earth, directed by this Treatise to the view or contemplation of all that is ex∣cellent in art, or nature. Such indeed is the sci∣tuation of the Country, such the nature of the soile, such the antient manners of the people, as gave them a just Prerogative to the Empire of the world: proportioned to their dominion were their actions, the great examples of ensu∣ing ages in all that was imitable, their wonder
<PB REF="4"/>
and amazement in what exceeds the hope of imitation. Of both you have a transitory ac∣count so interwoven with the general sur∣vay, that it is scarce possible a volume of this size, can contain more, or more worthy re∣marques of persons, places, things, from the remotest of times to this instant. For beside the necessarie instruction in the number of miles, &amp; conveniences of passage from Town to Town, through every part that can recom∣pence the trouble of a journey, you find a breif and yet a lively description of their several scituations, a repetition of their Historie, Go∣vernment, capital Families, eminent persons, ruined Amphitheaters, Arches, Bathes, old Temples, later Churches, Palaces of both sorts with their various ornaments; what they have bin &amp; what they are, when, and by whom founded, ruined, or restored. Not any thing an∣tient or modern, which a man upon the place ought to understand, seems omitted, nor is there any thing inserted to the unnecessary burthen of his memory: no Treatise in the Ita∣lian tongue was everso acceptable to strangers, none on this subject deserved so well from the natives. Whatever therefore the success be in the translation, you cannot but commend this Gentlemans choice, who after many years return from that pleasing journey, inten∣ded only a recollection of the language, and review of the Countrey, without any designe of making his papers publique, till assured by his friends they would in all hands meet a fa∣vourable
<PB REF="4"/>
reception; since the early progress of our English youth, and short abode there, seldom gives them opportunity to arrive to any per∣fection in that speech, till they are ready for de∣parture, nor do many of them long retain it. Of those how few are there that prefer not discour∣ses in their own? especially on a subject w<SUP>ch</SUP>. ad∣mits no continued elegancie of stile, or contains any thing not easily reducible to another Idi∣ome▪ Such as have traverst the History only, will find in every leaf a new delight by the brief recitals of the best Authors, enlightned with Chronologie, &amp; many doubtful passages reduc'd to certainty by the site and distance of the most memorable Cities, Fields, &amp; villages celebrate in Latin &amp; Italian stories. Those who are hitherto unacquainted with either, will here find enough to inform themselves, &amp; satisfie others, that they are not ignorant of any thing worth knowledge in that Country. Nay even to them who little regard the History or Geography, devotion wil render it acceptable, the most important cere∣monies of the Roman Church being briefly dis∣cours'd, and exposed to the different censures of those that read them with scorn or reverence. If there are any in the number of Readers who believe themselves unconcerned in all that is hitherto offred, there yet remains for them suf∣ficient entertainment, in the magnificent buil∣dings, elegant Gardens, Statues, Embosments, Paintings of all sorts, and in every sort more ex∣cellent then all the other parts of <HI>Europe</HI> pretend unto. Hence did the barbarous <HI>Britains, Gauls,
<PB REF="5"/>
Germans, &amp;c.</HI> derive their first civility, and hence in all succeeding ages received their best supply. Who in these nations less barbarous then their Ancestors, can think of that Country without re∣verēce? who can peevishly resolve to be ignorant of their story by refusing this Treatise? though I confess the Originals whence this Gentleman derives it, are not without manifold errors by the translation of Greek and Latin names into Italian, and extreme negligenee in the impressi∣ons, so that the english version wants a double Apologie, whilst it oft-times follows those mi∣stakes, and is in the phrase far from the per∣fection it had appear'd in, had our Translator in∣tended it for publique view. Yet is there no real lapse in the main, &amp; every where intelligible: the faults of the press are as carefully corrected as the Printers imporunate hast will permit. And whatever imperfections the curious Readershall after these reasonable excuses discover, it is to be hoped he will gently pardon, or vouchsafe to the Book-seller somthing of his own more excellent then what he now recommends to the Nobility, Gentry, and Merchants of the Nation.</P>

<HEAD>The way from <HI>Trent</HI> to <HI>Venice.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Rento,</HI> or <HI>Trent,</HI> is a City of the Province of <HI>Marca Trivigiana,</HI> or <HI>Marquisate</HI> of <HI>Treves,</HI> and is seated in a Valley on the confines of the said Province. It hath Walls round it, which are about the compass of a mile, and are washed by the River <HI>Ladice</HI> towards the North; Large and Fair Streets, paved with Flint-stones, and stately Houses. Its Churches are ve∣ry beautiful, though not large. There is one most sumptuous, and Royal Palace, which was lately restored by <HI>Bernardo Clessio,</HI> Bishop of the said City. Towards the East part thereof enters a little River, upon which are raised many edi∣fices, to work Silks in, as also to grind Corn; and from the said little River are brought many Rivolets, which run along the Streets, and into the Houses of the Citizens. Without the Gate called
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
Saint <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> upon the <HI>Ladice,</HI> there is a magnificent Bridge, of one hundred forty &amp; six paces in length (but of Wood) which conjoyns the <HI>Ladice</HI> with the other little River. The surrounding Mountains by, being continually covered with Snow, precipitous, and so high that the heads thereof seem to touch the heavens, are rendred in∣accessable. Between these Mountains, are two wayes, the one goes towards the North, the other towards <HI>Verona.</HI> It hath but little Champaign, or Fields, but those are pleasant and Rich, planted with Vines, and fruitful Trees, amidst which passeth the <HI>Ladice.</HI> In this place, may be seen the Castle, and Fort, called <HI>Pelen,</HI> appertaining to the most Noble Family of the <HI>Troppi.</HI> The Citizens speak good <HI>Dutch,</HI> and not ill <HI>Italian. Trent</HI> is now reduced under the power of <HI>Germans,</HI> and is a refuge for all <HI>Italians,</HI> when any disgrace happens to them in their own Countrey. They gather but little Corn, but, in lieu thereof, they have good quantity of delicious Wines, both White, and Red. In the Summer, the Air is good, but the Sun beats upon it most vehemently on those dayes it remaineth in the sign <HI>Leo;</HI> And in the Winter, 'tis so very cold, by reason of the Frosts and Snow, that there is no living; their Stoves are not sufficient to provide against it, because the cold is so fierce, that it turneth the Rain into Snow, before it can fall to the Earth; and that which occasions the greatest wonder here, is, that in that time their Wells, or deepest Pits, are void, and empty of Water. In stead of Mules, Asses, and Horses of Burthen, they serve themselves of their Oxen, and Cows, with Charrets so easie to carry goods, that they run up by the Moun∣tains, as if it were in a Plain; though 'tis very true, that the wayes are so well helped by the Cliffs, or Craggs, that the Beasts may go a∣ny where with little labour.</P>
<P>This City was greatly illustrated, and enriched certain years past, by the General Council held here: for that there met then five Pre∣sident Cardinals; Two Legats of the Council, for his Holiness, <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth, Chief Bishop, or Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> being Cardinals also, that is to say, Cardinal <HI>Loreno,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Madruccio;</HI> Three Patri∣archs, Thirty two Arch-bishops, Two hundred and thirty Bishops, Seven Abbots, Seven Generals of <HI>Religion,</HI> One hundred forty and six Doctors of Divinity, between Seculars, and Regulars; The Em∣bassadour of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperour, as well in the name of the Em∣pire, as of the Kingdoms of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> as also the Embas∣sadours of the King of <HI>France,</HI> of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and of <HI>Portugal,</HI> of the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> and of the other Catholique Princes.</P>
<P>The Council was held in the Church of Saint <HI>Mary,</HI> where there is a very fair Organ. In the Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> are the Ashes of the blessed <HI>Simeon,</HI> Martyred by the wicked Jewes. In the Church of the Fryers <HI>Heremitans</HI> lies buried Cardinal <HI>Seripando▪</HI> who was Le∣gate of the Council, a man famous for Holiness, and Doctrine. The Cannons are all illustrious persons, and have authority to choose the Bishop, Lord of the City, and Prince of the Empire, which dignity, three Cardinals of the most Noble Family of the <HI>Madrucci,</HI> have en∣joyed successively, of which one named <HI>Altiprando</HI> lives at present, a religious Person, and a lover of Learned men.</P>

<HEAD>BASSANO.</HEAD>
<P>FRom <HI>Trento</HI> the way lies to <HI>Bassano,</HI> travelling towards the East by the Valley of <HI>Sugana,</HI> called by the Antients <HI>Euganea,</HI> because a People of that name dwelt there; This Plain is eighteen miles in length, and two only in bredth, whence you may go to <HI>Venice,</HI> but 'tis too long a journey. Five Miles forth of <HI>Trent,</HI> is situated the rich, and populous Countrey of <HI>Perzene.</HI></P>
<P>At the Head of the Valley, near <HI>Primolano,</HI> are the confines be∣tween the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and <HI>Germans.</HI> Upon the high Mountain of <HI>Primolano</HI> is there built a most strong Bulwark of the <HI>Venetians</HI> called <HI>Strada,</HI> where a few Souldiers can repel the Dutch, when ever they offer by violence, or force, to advance forwards. At twelve miles distance from thence towards the East, among the <HI>Alps,</HI> is the City of <HI>Feltre,</HI> by the which way at the right-hand-shore of the River <HI>Brent,</HI> three miles distance from <HI>Scala,</HI> is seated <HI>Cavolo,</HI> a Fort of the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI> inexpugnable, in respect that 'tis founded upon a great Rock directly hanging over the high-way, with a Fountain of living water in it, whereto neither Man, nor Goods can be mounted from the Earth, unless fastned to a Rope, and that wound up upon a wheel, from which (because 'tis a very narrow way underneath, between the Mountain and the River) with small labour, may their enemies be slain with Stones cast on them, as they march along. Thence five miles distant, is the River <HI>Cisimone</HI> (wch disembogues it self into the <HI>Brenta</HI>) where the Dutch and <HI>Feltrini,</HI> daily load great quantities of Timber and Wood, as well for the use of Building, as for firing, which they afterwards transport to <HI>Bassano,</HI> to <HI>Padoua,</HI> and to <HI>Venice.</HI> Seven miles distant from <HI>Bassano,</HI> on the Right-hand-shore of the <HI>Brent,</HI> lies the Countrey of <HI>Valstagna,</HI> placed at the foot of the Mountains, and famous for the Sawes there made: thence di∣stant three miles, lies the Countrey of <HI>Campese,</HI> where in the Church of the Fryers of Saint <HI>Benedict</HI> lies buried he that wrote <HI>la Macha∣ronea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bassano</HI> lies at the foot of this streight Valley, and is washed to∣wards the West by the <HI>Brent,</HI> called antiently <HI>Brenta,</HI> or <HI>Brentesia,</HI> the which hath its Sourse, or head, beyond the <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> twelve miles, near <HI>Levego.</HI> Over the <HI>Brent,</HI> a little forth of the Gate of <HI>Bassano,</HI> is built a great Bridge of Wood, which conjoyns both the Rivers. Between the <HI>Alps,</HI> and this Castle, there are some Hills, which pro∣duce most abundantly all things requisite, as well for necessary li∣ving, as delicacy, but most particularly, they abound with Olives, and precious Wines. The River <HI>Brenta</HI> runs thorow the Territory of <HI>Vicenza,</HI> passeth by the City of <HI>Padoua,</HI> and in the end dischargeth it self, by the Fenny, or Moorish grounds, into the Sea. In this River, they take excellent Fish, as <HI>Trouts, Pollard,</HI> or <HI>Chieven, Eyles, Pyke, Tench, Lampreys, Barbel,</HI> and <HI>Crabfish.</HI> In no place are the men more ingenuous in Merchandize than in this: particularly in weaving of Cloth, in turning most neatly in Ivory, and in Carving in Nut∣Trees. There is never a year, that they dress less than fifteen thou∣sand pound weight of Silk, and notwithstanding that, that which is made in <HI>China</HI> is esteemed better than is made in any other part of
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
the world, nevertheless 'tis known, that this of <HI>Bassano</HI> is more sub∣tile or thin, and more light. Hence the Family of the <HI>Carrareci</HI> drew their Original, and <HI>Eccellino</HI> the Tyrant, as also <HI>Lazaro,</HI> surnamed <HI>Bas∣sano,</HI> a person not meanly learned, nor less acquainted in the Greek tongue than in the Latine: he lived a long time in <HI>Bologna,</HI> with great satisfaction to the learned, afterwards he rendred himself at <HI>Padoua,</HI> to the end that he might illuminate those who were studious of good Letters. At present <HI>Giacomo dal Ponte,</HI> an excellent Lymner, greatly illustrates this Country, together with four of his Sons, cal∣led vulgarly, the <HI>Bassani. Bassano</HI> hath under it twelve Towns, which with it self contein to the number of twelve thousand Souls.</P>

<HEAD>MAROSTICA.</HEAD>
<P>AT three miles distance from <HI>Bassano</HI> towards the West, is seated a strong place, named <HI>Marostica,</HI> a Castle built by the Lords of <HI>Scala,</HI> near the Mountain, and fortified with Walls, and two Sconce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. Antiently this Castle stood in the neighbouring Mountain, which looks towards the East, where, at this time are to be seen the Foun∣dation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. Here the Air is most perfect, and the Countrey as pleasant, and produceth excellent fruits, in great abundance, but it most ex∣cels in Cherries of all sorts, which are so infinitely pleasant, and so well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>elished, that therefore in many places they are called <HI>Marosti∣cane.</HI> There are many Fountains of clear Water; and thence about two miles, is a Lake called <HI>Piola,</HI> whose waters abate, and rise, in the same manner as they in the Golf of <HI>Venice,</HI> with great admiration to the beholders. The Inhabitants of this Castle are extreme conten∣tious, whereupon an Elegant Poet wrote thus,
<Q><L>Restat &amp; in Civibus Marii discordia vetus,</L>
<L>Quae cum Syllanis saevit in urbe viris.</L></Q></P>
<P>Within this Castle, are many Churches, among which is that of Saint <HI>Bastiano,</HI> where the Fryers of Saint <HI>Francis</HI> dwell, wherein lies the Body of the blessed <HI>Lorenzuolo</HI> the Child, Martyred by the wic∣ked Jews, who antiently there inhabited. <HI>Francesco</HI> of the Family of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>reschi,</HI> hath much illustrated this Castle, who publickly Read the Civil Law in <HI>Padoua,</HI> and likewise <HI>Angelo Mateaccio,</HI> who hath composed some Books of the Laws. At this present, adds no small Fame to this his Countrey, <HI>Prospero Alpino,</HI> the most excellent Physici∣an, publique Reader of the first matter of Simples, in the Academy of <HI>Padoua,</HI> who hath written <HI>De plantis AEgypti, De Opobalsamo,</HI> and <HI>De Praesagienda vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, &amp; morte AEgrotantium,</HI> lately published, And is now employed (besides his publick Reading) in composing, and ripening some other noble Work for publick view. Thorow the middle of this Castle, runs the little River called <HI>Rozza,</HI> whence about a mile passeth the <HI>Sillano,</HI> so called, because in Antient Language, it signified a Stream of running water. 'Tis believed, that the Antient <HI>Romans</HI> much frequented this Place, for that the Inhabitants to this day re∣tain certain Latine words, though something corrupted. Before

<HEAD>TREVISO.</HEAD>
<P>THe Antient City of <HI>Treviso,</HI> is situated on the East of, and at the distance from <HI>Bassano</HI> twenty five miles. This City was founded by <HI>Osaride,</HI> the third King of the <HI>Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ans,</HI> who being adopt∣ed Son of <HI>Dionisius</HI> (therefore conceded unto him <HI>AEgypt</HI>) and Reigned in <HI>Italy</HI> ten years: And because after his death, there ap∣peared to the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> an Ox, they supposing it to be their King <HI>O∣siris,</HI> worsnipped it as a God, and called it <HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> which in their lan∣guage signifies an Ox, for which reason in many places of <HI>Treviso,</HI> is found an Ox painted with this Motto: <HI>Memor:</HI> in memorial of their first founders. Others say that <HI>Treviso</HI> was built by the Companions of <HI>Antenor;</HI> Others by the <HI>Trojans,</HI> who went from <HI>Pastagonia;</HI> but whosoever it was built it, imports not much, since 'tis most certain, 'tis a City of great Antiquiry. They oftentimes came to Warlike disputes with the <HI>Padouans,</HI> as also with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>or maintenance of their consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>es, and although through their vigilancy, and victory over the power of their Enemies, they had much enlarged their T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣ritories, almost over the whole Champain, yet to secure themselves the better, they erected several Towers, whence they might disco∣ver their Enemies, obstruct them from too near approaches, and as necessitated therein, make their own retreat secure: and for this rea∣son, was it along time called the City of <HI>Towers,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>earing for its Aims three Black Towers in a white Field. This City either for that it was the most noble of all the other, or for that it became first under their Dominion, the <HI>Longobardi</HI> made the seat of their <HI>Marquesate, Marca</HI> signifying in their language, Confines: whence all this Province is called by the name of <HI>Marca;</HI> Wherein antiently were six principal Cities, (at present but four) with many other Cities, and great Castles. Its Territory is in length from East to West forty miles, and from North to South, fifty miles. It was subjected to the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> to the <HI>Longobards,</HI> Then to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> afterwards to the People of <HI>Scal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> after them to the <HI>Carraresians,</HI> and lastly in the year of our Lord, One thousand three hundred eighty eight, it was reduced under the Dominion of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to whom from that time to this day, they have maintained constant Faith and Obedi∣ence. This City was converted to the Christian Faith, by the Preaching of Saint <HI>Prosdocimo,</HI> Disciple of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> from whence

they took, a white Crosse in a Red Field for their Aims, in liew o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> their Black Towers. About <HI>Treviso</HI> runs the River <HI>Sile,</HI> with many other Rivolets, which incorporate with it, and towards the East, it hath the great River of <HI>Piave,</HI> wherein they take the largest Crabfish. The Countrey abounds in all things, but principally it breeds the Fatrest Calves. It conteins many sumptuous Pallaces, and not a few Noble Families.

<P><PB N="8" REF="16"/>The next object worth a view, is the Royal and Proud Pallace of the Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> which was first begun to be erected by <HI>Ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o Participatio,</HI> in the year of our Lord, Eight hundred and nine, since when though six times burnt either in part, or in all it rise again▪ and recovered much more beauty and lustre▪ Its Form, is not alto∣gether square, the length somewhat exceeding the Bredth. To∣wards the North of it, stands the Church of Saint <HI>Marco,</HI> towards the East, the Grand Canale, or Channell, towards the South the Sea Coast, and towards the West, the <HI>Piazza,</HI> or broad Place of <HI>Venice.</HI> From the principal Gate of this Pallace, to that Coign which st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nds next the Bridge, called <HI>Paglia,</HI> or <HI>(Straw Bridge)</HI> towards the South: It hath an Arcade of 36.

The two Frontispieces thereof, appear Pargetted with White and Red Marble, in the midst whereof are little Ascents or Hills, where∣on are set thirty seven Collumnes, made in the Form of <HI>Pyramids,</HI> with seventy two Arches; The Facade or Frontispiece backwards was lately beautified with <HI>Istrian Stone,</HI> and is contignous towards the North, with the Church of Saint <HI>Marco.</HI> The Roofs of this Pal∣lace were heretofore covered with Lead, but the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e that happened in the year, 1574. caused it to be covered instead of lead, with Sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t of a certain Mettle. Every Front hath one Gate, The principal which is conjoyned with the Church, (of a Piramide Figure) looks to∣wards the <HI>Piazza,</HI> or broad Place, just before which stands the wing∣ed Lion, and the Duke <HI>Foscaro,</HI> Carved in White Marble. Next within on the right hand, is found a spatious Court, wherein are two Wells of sweet Water, whose mouthes are made with Brass, garnish∣ed with Spouts, and other Curiosities. At the end of this Court, is the Gate which answers to the Sea. Then having ascended the close Stairs called <HI>Foscara,</HI> on the left hand, you may go round the Pallace upon the Tarrace. The two Fronts backwards, the one whereof lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ks towards the Sea, the other towards t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e <HI>Piazza,</HI> parallell them that are forwards, except that they have neither Arches, nor Col∣lumnes below. The Front towards the East on the even ground, hath thirty six Arches, and as many Pillars of <HI>Istrian Stone,</HI> over the which, there is an open Gallery of fifty four Arches, and fifty five Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>umnes. On the Top is drawn a Wall of <HI>Istrian Stone,</HI> adorned with beautiful Cornishes. Just against the Principall Gate, stands the large Stayer-case of the Pallace towards the North, which leads directly to the Lodging of the Prince, at the foot of this Stayer-case st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nds two Colossuses, the one of <HI>Marse,</HI> the other of <HI>Neptune,</HI> Upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>op thereof likewise, just opposite to them, stands two most ex∣cellent Statues, the one of <HI>Adam,</HI> the other of <HI>Fve.</HI> The Front be∣low towards the Canale, or Channel▪ hath two Stayer-cases, by the which, they ascend to that most Royal Corridor, or open Gallery, wherein stand many Tribunals, or Courts of Justice. Opposite to the Chief Stayer-case, is a Memorial of <HI>Henry</HI> the third King of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> engraven in Marble with Letters of Gold. From the South East, they ascend that most splendid Stayer-case, which upon the left hand leads to the Chamber of the Prince; and on the right hand to the Colledge. Where the Eye is wholly taken up with
<PB N="9" REF="16" MS="y"/>
beholding the most sumptuous Vaulted, or Arched Roof, or Seeling, Richly garnished with Gold.</P>
<P>This College stands towards the East, over the Chamber of the Prince, whose vaulted Roof (as at <HI>Venice</HI> they call it) is partly guilt, partly Carved with great Artifice, partly Painted, and wrought with Histories, even to Admiration; At the upper end of this Hall, is ex∣alted the Imperial Throne of the Duke, and the Images of <HI>Venice,</HI> figured by a Queen, who disposeth the Crown upon his Head. Here the Duke with the Senatours transact the affairs of State, and give Audience to Embassadours, as well such as have recourse to them from their own Territories, and Cities, as of Foreign Princes. Out of which leads a door into another great Hall, wherein are figured all the Provinces, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> possess upon the firm Land, where also are erected eleven most excellent Statues of Emperours. Issuing forth of these Places, and walking towards the Sea, you meet the dreadful Tribunals of the Counsel of <HI>Tenne,</HI> where every Place gloriously shines with Gold and costliness.</P>
<P>A little more forwards is the spacious Hall, or Senate House of the Great Counsel, where they dispose the publique Offices, and Ballott the Magistrates; which Counsel orders it self in this manner. First the Duke royally clad, sits on a Throne, raised a good higth from the Ground. On his Right Hand, he hath three Counsellors near him, accompanyed by one of the Chief of the Magistrates of forty, for Criminal Offences: Just opposite to the Prince at the other End of the Great Hall, sits one of the Chief of the Illustrious Counsel of the <HI>Tenne.</HI> A little from whence seats himself one of the Advocates of Comminalty. In the Angles, or Corners of the Great Hall, stands the Old and New Auditors. In the middle are the Censors. The rest of the Nobles of <HI>Venice</HI> sit promiscuously in other Seats less rai∣sed from the plain ground of the great Hall. Into which Counsel cannot be admitted any that is not Noble, and who is not above the age of twenty five years. Afterwards the Grand Chancellour (ha∣ving first recommended to every One their duty, to elect a Person fit for that Magistracy) names the first Competitor. Then certain lit∣le Lads, go up and down the Hall with double Boxes, the one wher∣of is white, the other green; The White forwards, the Green more inward gathering the Balls, which Balls are small, and made of Cloth, that by the sound of the fall into the Box, may not be judged into which 'tis cast, and before he casts in, the suffrage giver, must shew that he hath but one Ball, and also tell the name of that Gentleman who stands for those that perhaps have not well heard who 'twas, do it (many times) over again; He that would exclude the Stander casts the Balls into the Green Box, and he that would have him cho∣sen casts them into the White Box, which are made in such a Form that none can discern into which of the Boxes they put their Balls, The Procurators of Saint <HI>Mark,</HI> never enter into this Great Counsel, Except at the Election of the Duke) but stand under the Lodge with the Master &amp; Officers of the Arsenal, while that great Counsel is gathered together for its Guard, dividing among themselves those dayes, whereon they ought to have this Charge. But of these things for further satisfaction we referr the Reader to such, who treat of them at large, herein intending only to glance briefly at the most remarkable things.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="17"/>This great Hall, is seventy three foot broad, &amp; one hundred &amp; fifty foot long, and was begun in the year, One thousand three hundred &amp; nine. On its walls were drawn by the most excellent Painters of that Age, the victories of this Commonwealth, Its Princes, with ma∣ny other famous Men of <HI>Italy,</HI> which being spoyled by the smoak of that Fire, which happened in the year, 1577. in liew thereof, was Painted the History of <HI>Alexander</HI> the third chief Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> the Emperour, with the subjection of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Republique. The Floors are wonderful neat: Towards the East, is seated the Throne of the Prince, over which is a Paradise Painted by the hand of <HI>Tintoretto</HI> (which was formerly Painted by <HI>Guariento</HI>) and fils up all that Front. In the Front over against that, within a square of Marble, is an Image of the Holy <HI>Virgin,</HI> holding in her Arms, her little Infant, compassed about by four Angels. The Windows of this Hall, look some into the Court, and others into the Sea. Near hereunto is the Magazine of the Pallace, which is never opened, but to Foreign Princes, wherein is provision of Arms, for fifteen hundred Gentlemen, more or less, and 'tis divided into four spatious Portals, with the Doors thereof of Cipres Wood, which give a most sweet savour. On the other side of the Hall of the Great Counsel is beheld the Hall of the Inquisitors, with many and divers Pictures, amongst which is a Judgement, drawn by the hand of <HI>Tin∣toretto.</HI></P>
<P>Thence descending by the Foscaran Stayers, you enter the Dukes Chappel being the Cathedral Church of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP> is built with the fairest and finest Marble with great skill, and no less expence, whose Pavement is composed all of little pieces of <HI>Porphiry,</HI> and <HI>Serpentine,</HI> and other pretious Stones after the Mosaick manner, with divers Fi∣gures. Among others, there are some Figures Effigiated by Com∣mission of <HI>Gionachino Abbat</HI> of <HI>Santo Fiore</HI> (as is the common Fame) by which is presaged and demonstrated the great ruine which will fall upon the People of <HI>Italy,</HI> with other strange misfortunes: Where you beheld two Cocks, very boldly to carry away a Fox (wich signi∣fies (as some will have it) that two <HI>French</HI> Kings should carry away, and force <HI>Lodovico Sforza</HI> out of the Seigniory of <HI>Milan.</HI> And also some Lyons Large and Fat appear as put in the Water, and some o∣thers set upon the shore very lean. Upon the Walls of the finest Marble, on the left hand, are two Tables of white Marble, some∣what weaved with black, which at their joyning, represent a Man, so perfectly figured, that 'tis very wonderful to consider it. Where∣of <HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> in a work called <HI>Meteora</HI> (as of a great rarity) makes mention. There are in this sumptuous Temple (reckoned amongst the chief of <HI>Europe,</HI> (though not so much for its vastness, as the design and pretious materials) thirty six Collumnes of the finest Marble, which are large two feet Diamiter. The Roof of it is di∣vided into five Cupoloes covered with Lead. From the plain of this Place, to the very Top of the Temple, are the Fronts wrought up in <HI>Mosaicke</HI> work, with Figures in a Field of Gold, and certain lit∣tle Heads of Pillars, and Juttings out, or Eeves of Marble, upon which are set certain Images carved in Marble so perfectly, that they seem alive. There are also above this place on that part, which lies over the great Gate (whereof this Part hath five made of Brass)
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
four Horses very Antique of Brass guilt, of an exact Proportion, and extremely beautiful, which the <HI>Romans</HI> caused to be cast, to put them in the Triumfal Arch of <HI>Nero,</HI> when he Triumphed over the <HI>Parthians,</HI> and they being afterwards transported by <HI>Constantine</HI> to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> from thence (the <HI>Venetians</HI> being thereof become Lords) transported them to <HI>Venice,</HI> setting them upon the Temple of Saint <HI>Mark.</HI> In the Porch of the said Church, is seen a red square Marble Stone, upon which <HI>Alexander</HI> the third set his Foot upon the neck of <HI>Frederick</HI> the Emperour, whereon for that reason, are engra∣ven these words:
<Q>Super Aspidem, &amp; Basiliscum ambulabis.</Q></P>
<P>After which mounting to the Top of the Quire, by certain Steps of the finest Stones, you come to the place where the Singers stand on the Chief Feast dayes. There upon the great Alter, is the rich and fair Pixe framed of Gold and Silver, bedecked with many pre∣tious Stones, and Perl of an infinite price, which all persons admire that behold it. This Altar is covered over by one Arch, disposed into the form of a Cross, adorned with Marble, which the Antients called <HI>Tiberiano,</HI> supported with four Pillars of excellent Marble; wherein are carved the History of the Old and New Testaments. Behind this Altar, arise four Pillars of the purest <HI>Alablaster,</HI> five foot in length, transparent as Glass, placed there for Ornament of the Sacred and Holy Body of Jesus Christ consecrated or the Eucharist. In this Church are preserved with great devotion, many Reliques: and among others the Body of the Evangelist, this Republiques Protector Saint <HI>Mark,</HI> with his Gospel written by his own hand.</P>
<P>On the right hand of the Temple, in the midst thereof, is a large and high Gate, wrought all of Mosaique work, on the one side wher∣of stands the Effigies of Saint <HI>Dominick,</HI> and on the other that of Saint <HI>Francisco,</HI> which as 'tis reported, were made by order of the a∣bove named <HI>Gionachino</HI> many years before the said Saints came into the world. Within this Gate is kept the most rich Treasure of Saint <HI>Mark</HI> so much spoken of; wherein are twelve pretious Crowns, with twelve Brest Plates, all compassed about with fine Gold, and garni∣shed with many Stones of great value. Among divers others, with <HI>Rubies, Emeralds, Topasses, Crisolits,</HI> and other pretious Stones, and Perls of numatchable bigness; Two Unicorns Horns of a great length, with a third somewhat less. Many very large Carbuncles, Vessels of Gold, Scollops of Agat, and Jasper Stones of a good bigness. One Huge Ruby given this State, by <HI>Domenico Grimani,</HI> a most worthy Cardinal. An Emerald hower-glass heretofore presented to this most illustrious Seigniory, by <HI>Uscassano</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> with many o∣ther pretious things▪ Vessels, and Censores of Gold, and Silver. There also lies the Mitre or Bonnet (as we call it) with which every new Duke is Crowned. The which is traversed all over with the finest Gold, and pollish't, in whose wreathes, are many most pretious stones; and at the very Top, a Carbuncle of inestimable valew; I might also speak of the Candle-sticks, and Challices, with other things of such imminent valew, as may create wonder in the behol∣ders, but would take up too much time and room to describe them in this Abreviation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18"/>Just opposite to this Temple, and distant from it about Eighty Paces, stands the high Steeple, which is 40. Foot square on all sides, and Two Hundred and Thirty high, with an Angel set upon the Top, which like a Weather-cock turning with the Wind to all corners where it blowes, ever hath the Face towards it. All the said Top or upper part thereof, is richly guilt, which presents it to the Eye of such as addresse to <HI>Venice,</HI> (by reason of the reflection of the hot Sun thereon) <HI>Lucidely</HI> shining at a great distance; In the founda∣tion of this Steeple was more expended (as <HI>Sabellico</HI> declares) than in all the other structure. They ascend to the uppermost part of this Steeple, by certain little winding steps within, where a most excel∣lent Prospect discovers it self: as first, the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> divided into six Precincts, consisting of many little Islands, whose Bankes are conjoyned with Bridges, the Streets, the open Places, the Churches, the Monasteries, and other sumptuous structures; More∣over, the small Islands seated round about the City to the number of sixty, with their Monasteries, Churches, Pallaces, and most beauti∣ful Gardens; Upon some of which Islands, are erected many Col∣lumnes, by the <HI>Aquleiesi,</HI> the <HI>Vicentini,</HI> the <HI>Opitergini, Concordiesi, Altinati,</HI> and several other People, who to fly the Fury of <HI>Attila,</HI> King of the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> recovered this Place; gives no small Imbellish∣ment to this View. Between the said Moorish Grounds, now the Streets and the Sea, by Dame Nature is raised a Fence or Bank, to defend the City &amp; the small Islands, against the furious Waves of the Sea, (with which 'tis invironed) Which Fence is Thirty five Miles long, and bends in the shape of a Bow, opening it self in five seve∣ral Places, for each of which is a Gate, as well to permit Barkes to enter in at them, as to maintain the said Channels full of Water. The profound Havens of <HI>Chioza,</HI> and <HI>Malamocco,</HI> with the Forts built at the Mouth of the said Havens, to keep any Armado or Fleet at a distance; And lastly, the beholding the Mountaines of <HI>Carnia,</HI> and of <HI>Histria,</HI> and on the Right Hand, the <HI>Apenine</HI> Hills, with <HI>Lumbardy,</HI> together with the Famous Hills called <HI>Euganei,</HI> with the mouthes of the Rivers <HI>Adice,</HI> and <HI>Poe,</HI> and behind them the Alpes of <HI>Baviera,</HI> and of the <HI>Gerisons,</HI> alwaies covered with Snow, gives no small satisfaction, nor beauty to his Prospect.</P>
<P>And now we come to the Famous <HI>Piazza,</HI> or broad place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> whose platform resembles a Carpenters square, at the one end where∣of stands the Admirable Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and at the other, That of St. <HI>Geminian,</HI> wrought with excellent Stones, and round the said Place are built fair and sumptuous Houses all of Marble Stone, un∣der which are large open Galleries, wherein are Shops for several Artificors. In this place daily appear an infinite number of Persons, of all Qualities and Countries, in their several Habits, as well for Newes and Discourses, as for Traffick and Merchandize.</P>
<P>At the upper end of the said Place, upon the Channel called <HI>La Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>deca,</HI> are two Pillars admired for their Heigth and Bigness, which were transported heretofore from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> upon the one whereof, stands a Winged Lyon, the Republick Armes, in token of St. <HI>Marke</HI> their Protector, with this Motto, <HI>Pax tibi Marce Evangelist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣mens,</HI> and upon the other, is set the Statue of St. <HI>Theodore,</HI> between which Justice is done upon Traitorous Persons. These were brought
<PB N="13" REF="18" MS="y"/>
from <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> in the time of <HI>Sebastian Ciani</HI> the Duke, upon, certain Vessels of burden, together with another of equal Greatness, the which overcomming the Power and Industry of the Workmen labouring to lay it on the Earth, it fell into the Water, where at this time tis to be seen in the Deep: These vast Columns, were reared by an Engineer of <HI>Lombardy</HI> named <HI>Nicolo Berreterro,</HI> by the strength of great Ropes wet with water, retiring by little and little; who as∣ked no other reward for this his worke, but that it might be Lawful for Dice-Players to play there when they pleased without any penal∣ty: This <HI>Piazza</HI> is not intirely one alone, but fower united together. Opposite to the Church are reared three Standards upon three high pieces of Timber which are fastened by Lead cast into the boa∣red holes, they are wrought with figures to denote the liberty of this City, and have Brass Pedestalls. On the right side of the Church stands the Clock house adorned with the Celestial Signs gilt there∣on, with the Sun and Moons monethly ingress into them, most exact∣ly wrought and painted. Neer the Steeple is a sumptuous Palace built in this Age, after the <HI>Ionick</HI> and <HI>Dorick</HI> fashion, which rea∣ches even to the Church of Sain <HI>Geminian,</HI> which for the excellen∣cy of the Marble, Statues, Casements, Cornishes, Frets and other ornaments, together with the most incomparable Architecture, gives not place to any palace of <HI>Italy.</HI> Next is the <HI>Zecca</HI> or <HI>Mint-house</HI> built all of flint Stone, and Iron Barrs, without any manner of Tim∣ber. Annexed thereunto Stands the Library, which had its Origi∣nal from <HI>Petrarca,</HI> and was afterwards aggrandized by the Cardinals <HI>Niceno, Alexandro,</HI> and <HI>Grimano.</HI> Lastly, this <HI>Piazza</HI> is rendred so Proud and marvellous, by the Uniformity of Building, and o∣ther Imbellishments, that I cannot say all <HI>Europe</HI> affords its like.</P>
<P>The Island <HI>Muran,</HI> must next be visited by taking <HI>Gondola,</HI> or <HI>Boat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Muran.</NOTE> which for its Furnaces of Glass is much admired through the World. This Island is distant from <HI>Venice</HI> about a Mile, and was begun to be inhabited by the <HI>Altinati,</HI> and <HI>Opitergini,</HI> for fear of the <HI>Hunnes.</HI> At present 'tis very comely, and resembling <HI>Venice,</HI> as well in the stru∣ctures, as in the Quantity of Churches, but much more pleasant and delightful, in respect most of the Houses have open and spaci∣ous Gardens, set with all sorts of fruitful Trees. Among others, is the Church of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> with a Monastery belonging to the preach∣ing Fryers, well built, wherein is a famous Library full of good Books.</P>
<P>In this Place they make all sorts of Vessels of Glass (called Crystal Glass) whose variety &amp; Workmanship surpass all others of the same materials of the whole world. And the Artizans (except in excellency of the materials) every day find out new Inventions to make them appear more desirable, with works divers from one another. I will not speak of the variety of colours which they give thereunto, because 'tis so marvellous that I imagine it worthy all Peoples sight. They counterfet excellently several things of <HI>Agate, Calcidonian, Emerald,</HI> and <HI>Hyacinths,</HI> with other pretty Toyes so excellently, that I believe were <HI>Pliny</HI> to be revived, and should behold them, he would (ad∣miring them) much more praise these mens workmanship, and these artificial things, than he does the vessels of Earth made and burned by the People of <HI>Aretini,</HI> or of any other Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="19" MS="y"/>Opposite to the <HI>Piazza</HI> of Saint <HI>Mark,</HI> and about half a mile di∣sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Georgio.</NOTE> is seen the Church of Saint <HI>George,</HI> the Greater, a stately stru∣cture of Marble. In which is beheld most curious Marble, both in the Pavements, and in the Statues, with rich workmanship of Sil∣ver, and most sumptuous Sepulchres of Princes. The Fryers of Saint <HI>Benedict</HI> have here a noble Monastery, wherein are long open Galle∣ries, spacious Courts, ample eating-Rooms, and sleeping-Chambers, as also most pleasant Gardens, with a worthy Library.</P>
<P>In <HI>Venice</HI> are seventeen Rich Hospitals, with a great number of wealthy Churches, adorned with the exactest marble Stone; consisting of sixty seven Parish-Churches fifty fower Convents of Fryers, twenty six Monasteries of Nunns, eighteen Chapels, six Schools, kept within the Principal Fryeries or Monasteries. In all which Churches are fifty bodies of Saints, one hundred forty and three Organs, &amp; many Statues made at the cost of the Republick, in remembrance of illustrious Persons, which have valiantly fought for her, or done some other signal piece of service, that is to say, 165 of Marble, and 23 of Brass, among which most worthily pre∣sents it self, That proud Statue on Horseback wrought with Gold, of <HI>Bartolomeo Coglione</HI> the most famous Captain-General of the Ve∣netian Army, dedicated to him by this Republiek, before the Church of Saint <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> in testimony of his Fidelity, and Va∣lour.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are fifty six Tribunals, and ten Gates of Brass. The Store-House of the <HI>Germans,</HI> which is five hundred and 12 foot in circumference, whose Front outwards hath many excellent Fi∣gures, and inwards two Galleries which go quite round the one a∣bove the other, wherein are two hundred Lodging Chambers. There stand also up and down this City, besides what are above mention∣ed, infinite more Statues, Pictures, and glorious Tombes. At all seasons it abounds plentifully with fruits and herbs of all sorts, and two hundred several sorts of Fish: furthermore there are four∣hundred and fifty bridges of Stone, fourscore thousand Gonda∣loes or Boats, with twice as many Gondaloers or Watermen, with a vast number of Chanels, among the which the Principal is called the Grand Canale, or Chanel, one hundred and thirty paces in length, and forty in bredth, over which is built that most artificial Bridge, called the <HI>Rioalto,</HI> being one Arch which conjoynes both the Banks, to be accounted for its heighth, length, and bredth, amongst the most glorious fabricks of <HI>Europe;</HI> whereon are erected twenty four shops covered all alike with lead, that is to say twelve of a side with magnificent Balustrades behind. They ascend this Brid Bridge by three degrees of steps, that in the midst consists of sixty six Steps, and thoseof each side, of one hundred forty five; to these rarities, may be added the infinite concourse of People.</P>
<P>And to the end we may remove that erroneous opinion that this City was built by Fishermen; let us observe what <HI>Cassiodoro,</HI> who was Counsellor, and Secretary of <HI>Theodorick</HI> King of the <HI>Gothes</HI> speaks thereof. <HI>Vos</HI> (saith he) <HI>Qui numerosa navigia in ejus confinio possidetis, &amp; Venetia plenae nobilibus, &amp;c.</HI> which happening in the four hundred ninty and fifth year of our Salvation, and from the building thereof between 80. and 90. years, gives a fair presumption, that the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
could not acquire so great reputation, nor less possess so ma∣ny Vessels on the Sea, had they not been somewhat rich and noble too sometime before.</P>
<P>Your next visit must be to the Arsenal, or Magazine of War of this City, seated on the one side of it towards the two Castles, and <HI>Pa∣lace</HI> of the Patriark, which are compassed about with high Walls, and with the Sea. This Arsenal affords but one entrance by one only Gate, and by one only Chanel, where thorow are guided in all the shipping, and 'tis about the quantity of two miles in circuit. Here∣in generally they make all their works, and engines of War, but most particularly their Charge is to prepare here these 4. Materials for that Service, Timber, Iron, Brass, and Hemp. Of which their charge of Timber-work, they are so provident, (that besides what at first shewes itself to the view) there is under the water a good quantity of Gallies, great and small, Gallefoists, Pinnaces, Brigan∣tines, Masts, Main-yards, Oars, and Rudders, for their Sea ves∣sels. And for the Iron work, Bullets of all sizes, Nayls, Chains, Anchors, with divers Plates of Iron, as likewise for Brass, all sorts of Ordnance, and of all proportions. And lastly, of their Hempen works, all sorts of Shrouds, Sails and Cables. To which seve∣ral works, continually attend a vast number of Workmen, and ex∣cellent Handicraftsmen, who being as it were born in that Place, and from thence obteining their livelihood, Neither delight in a∣ny other Place, nor do no other thing, but what there by their seve∣ral Callings they are directed unto.</P>
<P>Therein are erected most ample Arches, wherein their several Vessels are kept dry, and built, some fully finished, some build∣ing, and others repairing. The next Curiosity, is their spati∣ous Halls, full of Arms for defence in <HI>Maritine</HI> service, as great Celades, Cariages, and Breasts; and no less provided of Offensive Weapons, as Pistols, Daggers, Bramble Sithes, Partisans, Jave∣lins, Two Handed Swords, Cross-bows, and Long-bows; Others of those Halls are filled with Artillery, as small and great Muskets, Falcons, whole Cannon, Demicannon, and Quarter Can∣non, Sacres, and Culverins. There are some pieces of A tillery which have from Three Barrels to Seaven, which are called (if I err not) the Organs, Engines made more for a certain Greatnesse and Mag∣nificence, than for use and service in War. To say no more, the whole is kept and governed with that order and neatness, that it doth not onely delight the Beholder, but would satisfie the most insatiable Appetite of gazers, and fill them with a certain spritely and Martial Ardour.</P>
<P>In fine, the Common wealth hath in this place all sorts of Ammu∣nition of Warr, as well for Land as Sea-service. All Engines for of∣fence, all charges for defence, and lastly, all things whatsoever made ready, either to set in order an Armado for Sea service, or an Army for Land-service, which may be needful. And although from this place (which may properly be called the Work-house and Store∣house of War) they every Day fetch Arms and Ammunition, as well for their force upon the firm Land, as upon the Sea; Yet nevertheless, by the daily labours of the Artizans, 'tis so restored, that it seems to no more diminish, than the Sea does by the many Rivers that is∣sue

out of it. Furthermore here is kept the stately Galley called the <HI>Bocentoro,</HI> adorned greatly with Gold and rich carvings, which ne∣ver goes forth but upon solemn Feast Dayes, and particularly upon the Day of the Ascension of our Saviour, on which Day, the Prince in great state, with a Train of the principal Senatours enter herein, and being thence rowed to the Port of the two Castles near the <HI>Adri∣atick</HI> Sea, there after certain Ceremonies, the Duke solemnly marries the Sea, and casts therein a Gold Ring, in real assurance of this Re∣publicks Dominion thereof.</P>
<P>This Republick allow the Greck Church a full liberty in <HI>Venice,</HI> who use as much ceremony in their Religion as the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but less superstition. Nor have the <HI>Jewes</HI> mean privileges, (for pro∣vided they alwais wear a red hat to denote the Blood they wisht and drew upon their own heads when they crucified our Saviour, and without which tis Lawfull for any one to kill them) they have as great immunities in all things as the Naturals, and more power than the Common sort; here also they have a Synagogue for every Nati∣on, whereof they have nine in their <HI>Guetta</HI> or Court, which is as∣signed them for their habitation. Their concourse hither is from their immunities grown innumerable, which I suppose may give as great occasion as any other for this Cities vast Traffique whereof she is Mistress in these parts, as also for the rise and fall of the Ex∣change at the pleasure of her Merchants: in their Bank are managed vast sumes of money, and infinite exchanges dayly made, and yet a very small sum of money told out or payed through the yeer, such is the Reputation of those eminent Senators who are there the Bankers, where most of the Merchants accounts are kept for a small matter; the Ducket de Banco, whereby they compute their greatest sums and govern their exchanges, is but an imaginary Coyn, rising and falling at their pleasure. The Citizens rich and poor, wear a black Cap edged with fur on their heads, and are habited common∣ly with a long black Gown with large sleeves with a kind of skirt to throw over one shoulder, and their Collar alwaies open. Their La∣dies did formerly wear their own or a counterfet hair below the shoulders trimmed with gemms and flowers, and mounted in their Chappenes (high as a mans legg) they walk between two hand∣maids to distinguish themselves from the Courtezans, (from whom the State for their free trade extract a great excise yeerly) who go covered with a white veil of tiffany. But of late yeers they use the French freedome both in habit and conversation much differing from the Italian restriction through their Jealousie. We had almost forgot the Island of <HI>Zuecca</HI> (distant from <HI>Venice</HI> one mile) wherein<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zuecca.</NOTE> vast Edifices as well for divine worship, as for the use of the Citi∣zens, with stately Gardens discover themselves; among the rest the Church (<HI>del Redentore</HI>) or of the Redeemer deserves a place even amongst the fairest of <HI>Venice</HI> for its splendor and sumptuousness, be∣ing designed by <HI>Palladius</HI> the famous Architect, and built by order and at the cost of the State by a unanimous Vow which they made in the yeer 1576 when they were infected with an extreme plague: Which to denote, over one of the Gates of the right side of the said Church, we finde it thus written.

<HEAD>PADOUA.</HEAD>
<P>TO goe from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Padoua,</HI> first they take Boat at <HI>Venice,</HI> and row five Miles upon Sholes in the Gulf of <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Lizafusina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lizafusina.</NOTE> so called from a Dutch word corrupted: At which place the direct course of the River <HI>Brent,</HI> was heretofore by the Lords of <HI>Venice</HI> ar∣tificially locked up, to the end, that running through those Pools and salt Moors, it might not through time and continual running work down the neighbouring Grounds: which to prevent, there was an Engine erected (called <HI>La Rota del Carro</HI>) whereby with ex∣cellent Industry, the Barkes, with all their Lading and Merchan∣dize, were drawn up and transposed from out of these Pools, or salt Moors, into the River, and out of the River in like manner into the Pools; which at this time is taken away, and for supply thereof, the water is locked in with four several Flood-gates, the first at <HI>Strà,</HI> the second at <HI>Dolo,</HI> the third at <HI>Mirà,</HI> and the last at <HI>Mo∣ranzan.</HI> From <HI>Lizafusina</HI> to <HI>Padoua</HI> they account four Miles, whereby they travel either in Boats, which are drawn up against the stream of the River, or else by Land. On each side of which River through∣out, appears a large and most fertile <HI>Campagna,</HI> with a rich soyl, embellished with stately and most sumptuous Palaces, and lovely Gardens, and no lesse beautified with the continual travelling of all sorts of People to and fro.

<HEAD>PADOUA the Learned.</HEAD>
<P>The ancient City of <HI>Padoua,</HI> is seated in the Province belonging
<PB N="18" REF="21" MS="y"/>
to <HI>Venice,</HI> called <HI>Marca Trivigiana,</HI> in the midst of a spacious Plain, having the Sea at Twenty Miles distance on the East and South parts thereof: Towards the West, a large champion Country; And towards the North, the Mountains <HI>Euganei;</HI> It is of a triangular form, invironed with double Walls, and very deep Ditches; The <HI>Venetians</HI> have fortified it very much, by the immense Walls and Bulwarks, built by them according to the modern way of Discipline and Judgement in Warr.</P>
<P>We need not produce Testimony from antient Writers, to prove the Antiquity of this City, nor that it was founded by <HI>Antenor,</HI> Brother of <HI>Priam</HI> King of <HI>Troy,</HI> and that it was denominated hereto∣fore <HI>Pado,</HI> either from <HI>Pò,</HI> or <HI>Patavio</HI> of <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> because these things are notorious to all; As also that <HI>Padoua</HI> was Head of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Venice,</HI> now <HI>Marca Trivigiana,</HI> or <HI>Marquisate</HI> of <HI>Treves,</HI> and that it was ever Friend, and allied to <HI>Rome</HI> without any kind of sub∣jection, being extremely beloved and estemed, not lesse for their Alliance or Parentage, having their joynt Original from the Famous <HI>Troy,</HI> than for the many services and kindnesse received from it. Nor find we in any Author, That <HI>Padoua</HI> was either subjugated, over∣come, or molested by the <HI>Romans,</HI> but that it alwayes stood free from the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke, and that it aided the Republick on many occasi∣ons; And particularly, at that time when <HI>Rome</HI> was taken by the <HI>Galli Sireni,</HI> in the Warr against the <HI>Umbri, Boi,</HI> the <HI>Cimbri,</HI> and at several other times; So that it well merited and obtained the Fran∣chise and Liberty of Citizens and Comunalty of <HI>Rome,</HI> and to be in∣scribed in the <HI>Fabian</HI> Tribe of <HI>Rome,</HI> without sending thither new Inhabitants, or making it a Colony, from whence the <HI>Padouans</HI> de∣rived equal voice both Active and Passive, and participated all the highest degrees of that great Sate; And therefore we read in the Histories of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in those of <HI>Padoua,</HI> That many <HI>Padouan</HI> Houses transferred themselves to <HI>Rome,</HI> &amp; as many Roman Houses to avoid the Civil dissentions translated themselves to <HI>Padoua.</HI> We may then conclude it to be no great wonder, that we find in so many ancient Writers, and upon so many Marble Stones, the Remembrance of so many Citizens of <HI>Padoua</HI> that were Roman Consuls, as <HI>Quinto At∣tio Capitone, Sesto Papinio Alenio, L. Arontio Primo, L. Stella Poeta, L. Arontio Aquila, Giulio Lupo, L. Giulio Paulo</HI> the Expounder of the Law, <HI>L. Ascanio Pediano, Trasea Peto, C. Cecinna Peto, Pub. Quartio,</HI> and some others. Another <HI>Peto</HI> was designed Consul, and <HI>Peto Honorato</HI> was Corrector of <HI>Italy,</HI> so also many were Ediles, Praetors, Tribunes, Censors, Priests, and chief Bushops. It was then so great and pow∣erful, that they▪ used to muster five Hundred Cavaliers or Horse∣men, And <HI>Strabo</HI> writes, that they commonly sent to the wars, one Hundred and twenty Thousand Foot Souldiers. It maintain∣ed it self ever glorious and invincible, until the Barbarous Nations made themselvs to be felt in <HI>Italy,</HI> for at the time of the Roman Empires declination, <HI>Padoua</HI> also indured the smart, being by the most Potent <HI>Attila</HI> (the Rod of God) wholly ruinated, and cast down even to the very Foundations; And though after that it was restored by <HI>Narsete,</HI> yet was it another time destroyed by the <HI>Longo∣bardi.</HI> But afterwards under <HI>Charles</HI> the Great and his Successors, it began to fill it self, and to take some small restoration. This Ci∣ty
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
was governed at first by Consuls, and after with a <HI>Podestà,</HI> or Provost, at such time as it became under the Power of <HI>Eccelli∣no</HI> the Tyrant, who treated it most cruelly, which evidently appears; For at this day, neer the Church of Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> they shew a great Tower, wherein the <HI>Padouans</HI> were imprisoned, tormented and slain, nay the Cruelty of this wicked Tyrant so far exceeded, that in one day in the City of <HI>Verona,</HI> for no other cause than his fantasti∣cal humour, he caused twelve thousand <HI>Padouans</HI> to be Butchered. Out of the ruines of so many noble Palaces destroyed by him, he intended and begun near the Bridge a new Cittadel for his habita∣tion and security, but he lived not to finish above a fourth part, which is built with walls of a vast thickness with flint-stones squa∣red, with a fair Palace and a proud Tower, which in truth is the most beautifull in all <HI>Padoua</HI> (and is possessed at present by <HI>Il Signor Conte Giacomo Zabarella.</HI>) Many notable things are extant in this Ci∣ty, but in particular there is a vault under ground which passeth under the River, and goes even to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> to the Palace of the Captain, and to the other abovenamed Cittadel. After his death <HI>Padoua</HI> recovered her Liberty, and became very powerfull, so that she got under her dominion, <HI>Vicenza, Verona, Trento, Treviso, Fel∣tre, Belluno, Conegliano, Ceneda, Saravalle, Chioza,</HI> and <HI>Bassano,</HI> with all their Territories, all the good ground among the <HI>Fennes,</HI> and the greatest part of the <HI>Friuli,</HI> and other important places; then the <HI>Carraresi</HI> made themselves Lords thereof, and kept the power a∣bout one hundred yeers; at last the <HI>Venetians</HI> got the possession, ha∣ving slain <HI>Francesco Novello</HI> with all his Children, and extinguished the principality of the <HI>Carraresi.</HI> Through this City runs the River <HI>Brent</HI> together with the <HI>Bacchiglione,</HI> which dividing it self into ma∣ny branches gives a great accomodation to the Citizens. One of which branches or Arms they have brought to pass thorow the dike round about the Walls of the City. It affords in great aboundance all necessaries for livelihood, from whence the Proverb arises, <HI>Bolognia (Grassa</HI>) or wallowes in good cheer, but <HI>Padoua (surpassa</HI>) sur-passeth it. The bread they make here is the whitest of <HI>Italy;</HI> And the wine is by <HI>Plinie</HI> accounted amongst the most noble and excellent. This City hath about it seven gates, many Stone Bridges, five spacious <HI>Piazzaes,</HI> with many beautiful Edifices as well publick as private: Particularly the Palace used for the civil Law is the proudest in all <HI>Europe,</HI> if not in all the World, for so much as that it is covered with Lead, without sustaining either of Pillars or Beams, though its bredth is eighty six foot, and length two hundred fifty six. Which Pa∣lace after it had continued a foot 202 yeers being in part ruinated by fire, the <HI>Venetian</HI> Lords in the yeer 1420 rebuilt with greater splen∣dour. The figure of this Hall is like a Quarry of glass with equal sides, but not right angled, not for the nearness of the Fabrick as some will have it, but because natural reason shewes, that a man standing bolt upright is with much more ease thrown down than when he stands a little drawn backwards, its site is turned to the fower Quarters of Heaven, so that at the Equinoctial the Beams of the Sun at his rising entring through the Eastern Windowes, beat upon the Western Windowes, between which is nothing erected to ob∣struct it: and so upon the contrary. And at the solstice or▪ stay of
<PB N="20" REF="22" MS="y"/>
the Sun, when it can neither go higher nor lower, the Beams enter thorow the Gates on the South part, and play upon the opposite part; in sum, there is neither Gate or any other part without excellent Art and workmanship. The painting of it represents the influence of the superiour bodies upon the inferiour, divided with the signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> in imitation of that Circle of Gold which stood in the Sepulcher of <HI>Simandio</HI> King of <HI>Egypt:</HI> In this Painting is to be no∣ted the Antient Habits, and amongst others a Priest, who holds a Planet upon his back, which antiently they used large and of rich stuff, from whence it took its name. The Inventer of these Paintings averreth that this was <HI>Pietro d'Abano</HI> a <HI>Padouan,</HI> who was a most fa∣mous Philosopher and Astrologer, whom it may well be, since so many yeers before past, that these present Paintings copyed by the hands of certain <HI>Florentines,</HI> were drawn out from those which were preserved in the Antient Palace, by the hand of <HI>Giotto,</HI> and really these modern ones are very like to those which in the plain <HI>Astrolobe</HI> designed by the invention of <HI>Pietro d'Abano</HI> are treated on by <HI>Pierio</HI> in the thirty second and thirty ninth book of his hierogli∣ficks. And if the Antients made such a noise and so much ac∣count of the <HI>Obelisk</HI> which in the Field of <HI>Mars</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> shewed by his shadow the length of the Nights and Days, what shall we say of this Fabrick, wherein are collected so many noble secrets all worthy to be contemplated and admired?</P>
<P>Whosoever hath an appetite in <HI>Padoua</HI> to behold Paintings let them see the Church of the Confraternity of Saint <HI>Antonio,</HI> where they'l meet Pictures upon boards drawn by <HI>Titian,</HI> and other fa∣mous Masters, the Chapel of Saint <HI>Luke</HI> in the Sanctuary, where may be seen the true effigies of <HI>Eccellino</HI> the Tyrant, as also in the Font of the <HI>Domo</HI> or chief Church by the hand of an excellent Lymner. In the remarkeable Hall of the Lords of <HI>Zabarella Ve∣raria</HI> may be seen pourtrayed the first Subjects of this City, as <HI>Antenor</HI> its Founder, <HI>Volusio</HI> the Poet, <HI>T. Livio</HI> the Historian, <HI>Q. Ascanio Pediano</HI> the Grammarian, <HI>C. Cassio</HI> the Tribune, <HI>L.

<P>On the right hand of which is erected another Monument with an Image made of the whitest Marble of <HI>Sperone, Speroni,</HI> a man of an elevated Ingenuity, as may be known by his works, whichfor the most part he hath writ in the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue, with this Inscripti∣on following. <HI>Sperono Speronio sapientissimo, eloquentissimoque, opti∣mo &amp; viro, &amp; civi, Virtutem, meritaque acta vitasapientiam, eloquen∣tiam declarant scripta.

The one is of the abovenamed and not to be too much honoured <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> the words whereof follow.</P>

<P>To conclude with this Palace or Hall of Justice, if considered as an upper Room, tis the fairest and most spacious of <HI>Christendome,</HI> of which there is no part but hath some Astronomical secret; tis con∣vered with Lead, and round about goes a stately corridor of Marble.</P>
<P>Near the abovenamed Palace stand the Schools for all Learning; which is the second Marvel, not only of <HI>Padoua</HI> but of <HI>Europe,</HI> within is a square Court, the building two stories high one over ano∣ther, sustained with most fair Pillars; and round about in every cor∣ner are the Arms of all such as have been Consuls or Protectors in that <HI>University;</HI> some in colours only, some in colours and stone, with their Country, name, and yeer set up, at the <HI>Venetians</HI> charge, to make famous this Nursery of Learning. The <HI>Anatomick Theater</HI> erected in those Schools stands above, and is most neatly contrived, and most commodious both for the Professor &amp; the Spectators. This <HI>University</HI> of <HI>Padoua</HI> is as it were the Market place of Learning (and much ap∣proaches the Academy of <HI>Athens</HI>) To this place from all parts of the World throng the most eminent in all the liberal sciences, and no small number of the Nobles as Scholars, not only from all parts of <HI>Italy</HI> and its neighbouring Provinces, but from the farthest parts of the World. In this City are ten Colleges, where are allowed ho∣nourable Pensions to many Scholars.</P>
<P>The first College stands in the Street <HI>Santo</HI> called <HI>Prattense,</HI> derive∣ing its name from its Founder <HI>Pileo Conte di Prata,</HI> Cardinal, and Bi∣shop of <HI>Padoua,</HI> in which are appointed 20 Scholars, <HI>Padouans, Ve∣netians, Trivisans,</HI> and <HI>Furlans,</HI> with a Prior or Governor, who heretofore kept a Coach: The Scholars pensions were 20 Crowns <HI>per</HI> Moneth and more, but the Merchants Banke of <HI>Venice</HI> (who u∣sually payed them) being of late lessened, at present, besides their Lodging and Service, they have but ten Crowns by the yeer. The Cardinal committed the Government thereof to <HI>Francesco Zabarella</HI> his Nephew, and after his death to the most antient of his house, and of that of the Family <HI>di Leone,</HI> recommending it also to the care and overseeing of the successive Bishops of <HI>Padoua,</HI> and to the Pri∣or of the College of the Professors of the Laws.</P>
<P>The second called <HI>Spinello à Ponte Corvo</HI> instituted by <HI>Belforte Spi∣nello</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> is governedby the <HI>Priors</HI> of the Masters of Art, &amp; by the most Antient of the house of Doctors, where are maintained four Scholars Masters of Arts for five yeers, two <HI>Padouans,</HI> one <HI>Trevisan,</HI> and another Stranger, each of whose allowance is twenty five Duc∣kats by the yeer.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>The third named <HI>da Rio</HI> built in the street so called, and instituted by that Family, consists of 4 Scholars Masters of Arts, approved by the most antient of that family, their stay is permitted for 7 yeers, their allowance is, Lodging Rooms, Bread and Wine, with twelve Duckats, and they ought to be of <HI>Padoua</HI> or its Territories.</P>
<P>The Fourth called <HI>del Campione</HI> situated in the <HI>borgo di Vignal</HI> is for nine Scholars in the Arts: two <HI>Padouans,</HI> two <HI>Trivisans,</HI> two <HI>Far∣raresians,</HI> two <HI>French men,</HI> and one other Foreiner, and for seaven yeers, they are allowed Wheat, Wine, Wood, Service, Lodging, and some moneys. The Patrone or Master is the <HI>Abbot</HI> of Saint <HI>Ci∣prian</HI> of <HI>Muran.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth named <HI>Santa Cantarina</HI> is submitted to certain Noble <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI> and hath for Scholars in the Arts. 16 who have Corn, Wine, Money, Salt, Lodgings, and Service allowed in a handsome proportion for seaven years.</P>
<P>The sixth dedicated to <HI>Santa Lucia</HI> by the <HI>Brescians</HI> conteyns 6 Scholars in the sciences chosen by the Communalty of <HI>Brescia,</HI> their allowance is 25 Duckats a peece with their Lodging and service defrayed.</P>
<P>The seaventh called <HI>Feltrino</HI> founded in the Street <HI>Santo,</HI> is gover∣ned by the nobles of the family of <HI>Altini in feltre,</HI> the continuance of the Scholars (who must be students in the Laws) is seaven yeers, their number is but two Scholars and one-Artist, they have for allow∣ance a quantity of Wheat being 16 measures for each, and 10 Ma∣stellaes of Wine with their Lodgings.</P>
<P>The eighth built in the Street <HI>San Leonardo</HI> named <HI>del Ravenna,</HI> is put under the tuition of <HI>Piavano di S. Giulano di Venetia,</HI> &amp; the Scho∣lars have Lodging Rooms, Services, and one Duckat allowed by the yeer for each.</P>
<P>The ninth in the <HI>Viginali</HI> called <HI>Cocho</HI> is for Six Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> each ones allowance, being Lodging, Service, and 40 Duckats yeerly.</P>
<P>The tenth called <HI>Amulio,</HI> near the <HI>Pratto della vallae,</HI> is for 12 Scho∣lars Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> founded by <HI>Marco Antonio Amulio</HI> Cardinal, and every Scholar is allowed, Lodging Rooms, his services are pay∣ed, and six Duckats by the year.</P>
<P>The third notable and marvellous Temporal Rarity of <HI>Padoua</HI> is the <HI>Piazza</HI> or place caled the <HI>Arena,</HI> which is a noble Court, round about which stands the old <HI>Arches,</HI> and <HI>Vestigia</HI> of a proud <HI>Theatre,</HI> which by the antients was called <HI>Naumachia,</HI> but of later yeers they use it to run a Tilt, and for all manner of horsemanship, with ma∣ny other games; the Ladies standing to behold them in the open Casements of that proud Palace, which stands at the head of the Court in a Lunary form, the <HI>Arena</HI> or Court being Oval.</P>
<P>Backwards towards the Wall are gardens filled with Vines and pretious Fruits, as, also on that side which is towards the Church of the <HI>Hermits</HI> with a small Chapel dedicated to the holy Virgin, which is also a <HI>Priorate</HI> of the house of <HI>Foscarie</HI> and belonging to that serene Family of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth marvellous object is the Court of the Captain or Go∣vernour of the City, where the Proud Palace of the said <HI>Praefect,</HI> the Chamberlains and many other Citizens habitations, besides the
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
dwelling of a world of other People are so contrived that it may not improperly be called a little Cittadel: This was the Kingly house of the <HI>Carraresi,</HI> Its Chambers may truly be said to be built for Princes, with two halls which for their Largeness and Noble∣ness could not be built for other; the one is Called the Hall of <HI>Gi∣ants,</HI> wherein stands the publick Library: here are pourtrayed the most eminent Subjects of the <HI>Roman</HI> Republick, &amp; of the World, with a representation of their most famous Acts, by the hand of <HI>Gualterio</HI> a most eminent Lymner, with their Elegies under each figure, hereto∣fore composed by the most virtuous <HI>Giovanni di Cavazzi</HI> a gentlemā of <HI>Padoua,</HI> and inscribed in a signal Character by <HI>Pietro Francesco Pucivi∣giano</HI> called the <HI>Moor:</HI> The Books conteyned in the said Library are most excellent and in great abundance; The signor <HI>Gio Battista Salvatico,</HI> Doctor, Knight, and a Gentleman of <HI>Padoua</HI> bequeathed to it, by his Testament, his Collection of the Books of the Laws of a great valew. The signor <HI>Giacomo Caino</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Furlan</HI> Doctor and Reader in the College hath likewise given to it the Li∣brary of <HI>Pompeo Cacino</HI> a Physician his Uncle, of no less esteem; The signor <HI>Conte Giacomo Zabarella</HI> hath added to it a brave quantity of Manuscripts, some writ in parchment, others in paper bound in Leather Lymned with Vermillion and Gold rarely and exquisitely: some whereof were never Printed, amongst which are the workes of Cardinal <HI>Zabarella,</HI> of the Count <HI>Giacomo Zabarella</HI> his Grandfa∣ther of Philosophy; of the Count <HI>Francesco</HI> his Father, which are in rime and prose in the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Tongue very learned, and treating of many subjects concerning his own Family: Therein also are the Works of <HI>Cesare Cremonio</HI> the Philosopher, and many other bought at the Publick cost, and others added there by the Signor <HI>Ottavio Fer∣rari</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Milan</HI> Reader of Humanity in the Schools, and the publick Library Keeper, which Library is every day so increased by the Nobility and others, that tis well hoped within a lit∣tle time twill arrive to the Reputation of the richest and most fa∣mous in the World.</P>
<P>The fifth wonder is the Castle for the <HI>Munition</HI> above named near the Church of Saint <HI>Agostino,</HI> which was built by the Tyrant <HI>Eccelli∣lino</HI> for his safeguard, wherein he slew so many Noble <HI>Padouans,</HI> that he had almost destroyed the whole City: herein are the publick <HI>Gra∣naries</HI> to maintain plenty in the City, and all sorts of Ammunition for its defence in time of need.</P>
<P>The sixth admirable thing is the <HI>Ponte Molino;</HI> so called from the thirty wheels of Mills there erected (a most signal Object) and the five Arches of flint Stone; near which stands a Palace in manner of a Fortress built with those very Large squared &amp; wrought Stones w<SUP>ch</SUP> were brought from the other ruinated Palaces and Forts by <HI>Eccellino</HI> the Tyrant, with a Fort and most fayr Tower, in the yeer 1250 And is now possessed by the Count <HI>Giacomo Zabarella,</HI> as is above said.</P>
<P>The seventh wonderfull Object of <HI>Padoua</HI> is <HI>il Prato della, valle</HI> a Meadow so ample that twould alone contain a great City: It was antiently called <HI>Campo Marzo,</HI> the field of <HI>Mars,</HI> from the <HI>Martial</HI> ex∣ercises there used, and in this place were many Saints beheaded by the <HI>Pagans,</HI> to such a number that they are wont to say that part
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
which is compassed by Water was emplastered with the blood of those Martyrs: Here every first <HI>Saturday</HI> of the Moneth is held a free Fayr or Market of all sorts of Cattel and other Creatures, and at the Feast of Saint <HI>Antonio</HI> is a famous Fayr there, which although it happens in the hottest Weather, being there kept for fifteen days in the midest of <HI>June,</HI> and that there are then many thousands of Creatures, yet there is never seen a Fly to molest them.</P>
<P>If to these might be added an eighth Wonder, we would name the Vineyard or Garden of the Knight <HI>Bonifacio Papa fava,</HI> situate in the Street called <HI>Vanzo,</HI> where besides a most fair and adorned Palace, you beholds many statues of excellent workmanship, and infinite numbers of Cittron and Orange Trees, which forme lovely walks to the Passengers, for beautifying whereof, of those Trees are framed Arches and Prospects to delight the eye; to whose confines is conjoyned a full stream of water brought from the main River by a curious Aqueduct, which being confined to one Gate un∣der the Wall, gives at its utterance a sweet murmur, and with its clear gurgling on every side washes the Foot of the Palace: And the flowry bankes within which the said Rivolet is contained ren∣ders the Palace as it were in an Island of so specious delights and pleasant Savours, that what is added by Art to that of Nature may well cause it to be termed the eighth wonder. Hither flock for their Pastime the Ladies and Gallants of <HI>Padoua,</HI> inviteing with them also the Foreiners with their Musick and other Pastimes, where (in the hottest Weather) the shade of the Trees, the Ample∣ness of the Walks, the pleasantness of the Waters, and the beauty of the site add (to their other joys and delights) a fresh Ayr. And although these beauties shew themselves in perfection, yet that magnanimous Cavalier never ceases to illustrate it (to his no small costs) with greater delights; and by this and his other Gallantries shewes himself to be born of that Family which for its Greatness and Dominion was no less formidable in <HI>Italy,</HI> than renowned in <HI>Europe.</HI> At this present resides here, this Noble Person with his Brother <HI>Sci∣pio Papafava,</HI> Knight of the great Cross of the Order of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> Prior of <HI>Messina,</HI> and the most worthy Primate of the whole King∣dome of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> together with the virtuous <HI>Roberto</HI> Son of the a∣bove named Cavalier <HI>Bonifacio,</HI> young in yeers, but his conditions a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d practices may challenge the ripest Age, who is the Comendatory Abbot of <HI>Sebinico,</HI> being Doctor of Philosophy, of Divinity &amp; of the Laws, a true Splendor to his Country and Family, being conver∣sant in the Greek, Latine, and Hebrew Tongues, and well known in the Mathematicks, as was testified by the singular experiments of his Ingenuity some Moneths since. There flourishes likewise of this Noble Family at this time a numerous company of Cavaliers and great Subjects, who degrade not from their most famous and Anti∣ent Progenitors, of whom to speak but little will diminish from their Fame, and much is not opportune in this place: for their Ordi∣nary dwelling, these Signors have a Palace in the Street <HI>San Fran∣cesco Maggiore,</HI> where they have Coppies of exquisite Books in all the Professions, left them by Monsignor <HI>Ubertino Papafava</HI> Bishop of <HI>Adria,</HI> Brother of <HI>Bonifacio,</HI> besides many antient Manuscripts and Authors not yet printed, which relate the Histories of this Family
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
also the old coyning Press of the <HI>Carraresian</HI> Princes, with other pretious monuments of this House, preserved in the Chamber of Rowles of the said Palace, which may be termed the most large and worth seeing of this City.</P>
<P>And now we come to the Spiritual wonders and Churches of <HI>Pa∣doua,</HI> whereof the first is the <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathedral Church, situate (near) in the midst of the City. The <HI>Padouans</HI> were converted to the Christian Faith, by the predication of Saint <HI>Prosdocimo</HI> their first Bishopp authorized by Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> who (among others) bapti∣zed <HI>Vitaliono</HI> the Chief Man in this City, who therefore built the Church of Saint <HI>Soffia. Henry</HI> the fourth Emperor enriched this Ca∣thedral, giving to it twenty seaven rich Canonicats, of so good a revenew that they may be styled so many Bishops; among which are four dignities, that is to say, Arch- priest, Arch. Deacon, The Person that hath charge of the wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Deacon; there are twelve under Canons, six Custodi or Rectors, and six <HI>Mansona∣ry</HI> or Houskeepers, and more than 60 other Persons and Clerks be∣longing to the Chapel, besides the Masters of Grammar and Mu∣sick▪ with many excellent Singers, so that this Clergy exceeds a hun∣dred Persons, and their Revenew above a hundred thousand Duck∣ats by the yeer, which makes it the most noble and Rich of <HI>Italy:</HI> and therefore tis that the Bishop of <HI>Padoua</HI> is styled a little Pope, and his Canons with some reason the Cardinals of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> for that their Chapter is alwaies filled with the Nobility of <HI>Venice, Pa∣doua,</HI> and other Cities, whereof so many have ascended to the Miter, and Hatt, that tis worthily called to this day the Seminary of Cardinals and great Prelates.</P>
<P>In this Church (not elsewhere as is pretended) lyes enterred the Wife of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, whose name was <HI>Berta,</HI> as is proved by this antique Inscription.

<P>Under the Chorus within a rich Monument of Marble, lies the Body of Saint <HI>Daniel,</HI> one of the four Tutelars.</P>
<P>Two great Cardinals repose in this Church, who were both Arch priests of the same, that is to say, <HI>Pileo de Pratta,</HI> and <HI>Fran∣cesco Zabarella,</HI> with other eminent Persons.</P>
<P><HI>Pileo Conti di Pratta</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Padona</HI> and of <HI>Furlan</HI> was for his vertue created Bishop of <HI>Padoua,</HI> and afterwards Cardinal of Saint <HI>Prassede</HI> by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the 11th. and Apostolick Legate. But in the yeer 1378. the Schism being risen between <HI>Urban</HI> the sixth his successor, and <HI>Clement</HI> the Antipope, he was deposed by <HI>Urban,</HI> after whose death <HI>Bonifacio</HI> the ninth suceeding, he was again created Cardinal with the Title of the <HI>Tusculan</HI> Bishop, and Apostolick Le∣gate, and finally he dyed at <HI>Padoua,</HI> and was buried in this Church in a sublime and most noble Arch with this memorial.

<P>And this Arch was heretofore in the Chapel of the Holyest, on the right side of the Chorus, but being necessitated to make the door of the greater Vestry in that place, it was removed out of that Chapel, and adjoyned to the nearest Wall in a worthy and emi∣nent Place.</P>
<P><HI>Francesco Zabarella,</HI> a Philosopher, Divine, and a sublime Lawyer, was esteemed the Prince of the wise men of the World in his Age, and his works left behinde him prove his desert of that Title: He was a most Learned man in all the sciences, and of a most holy Life, for which reason the <HI>Florentines</HI> and <HI>Padouans</HI> offered him the Epis∣copal Dignity, and other Princes not a few eminent Degrees. At last Pope <HI>John</HI> the 22d. created him Arch-Bishop of <HI>Florence;</HI> then Caidinal of <HI>SS. Cosmo,</HI> and <HI>Damiano,</HI> in the yeer 1411: and after that Legate of the Apostolick Sea &amp;, Praesident of the Council of <HI>Constan∣za;</HI> where being earnestly desired and designed for Pope, he dyed in the 78rh. yeer of his Age, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1477. For whose Body (tran∣sported into his Countrey) was erected a most fayr <HI>Mauseole</HI> a rich Monument, where it reposeth to this day in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin, on the left side of the Chorus, in an Arch of pure white Mar∣ble with this Memorial.

<P>This Chapel was called of <HI>SS. Pietro,</HI> and <HI>Paulo,</HI> and was acquired and endowed by <HI>Bartol. Zabarella</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Spalatro</HI> for the use and name of his Family; who thence are Patrons of it and maintain therein two Chaplains; afterwards it took the name of the Blessed Virgin, when the Noble <HI>Matron Antonia Zabarella</HI> Sister to the Car∣dinal bequeathed to it by her Will that most holy Image, which was found in her house, then placed over the Altar of this Chapel, which Tradition saith was painted by Saint <HI>Luke:</HI> which <HI>Robert King</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> gave to <HI>Francesco Petrarcha,</HI> by whome twas trans∣ported to <HI>Padoua,</HI> and left to <HI>Giacomo</HI> the 2. of <HI>Carrara</HI> its Lord.

ascended to the Generalship, and thence by Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the 6th. in the yeer 1384. was created Cardinal of <HI>S. Cicilia,</HI> and de∣ceased five yeers after. Of this House are the <HI>Badoeri,</HI> Noble men of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the <HI>Padoeri</HI> of <HI>Padoua.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bartolomeo Oliar io</HI> the <HI>Minikin,</HI> a famous Philosopher and Divine, was by the <HI>Florentines</HI> elected for their Pastor. after which by Pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the ninth he was called to the Cardinalship of <HI>S.

<P><HI>Francesco Zabarella,</HI> was the 5th. <HI>Padouan</HI> Cardinal and Arch-Bi∣shop of <HI>Florence,</HI> as before is related.</P>
<P><HI>Lodavico Mezarota</HI> being a Philosopher and a Physician, deserted that his profession, and put himself under the command of <HI>Giovanni Vitelli</HI> General for the holy Church; and behaving himself well therein ascended from one degree unto another, till in the end (after <HI>Vitelli</HI> his death) he was constituted his successor, and Patriark of <HI>Aquileia:</HI> wherein he made such progress as is not to be imagined; let it suffice that he restored the Church to its Liberty, and delive∣red the <HI>Florentines</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> for which his Noble deeds he was by Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> the 4th made Cardinal of <HI>S. Lorenzo,</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Albany,</HI> and Chancellor of the holy Church, he dyed in the yeer 1465: at this day is his Family extinct.</P>
<P>And besides these there were others of this City intended for Cardinals, who being overtaken by death could not possess that dig∣nity, as <HI>Gabriel Capodelista, Aquensian</HI> Arch-Bishop was defigned Cardi∣nal by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the 5th, in 1304. <HI>Bartol. Zabarella</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Florence,</HI> having been Apostolick Legate in <HI>Germany, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> for weighty affairs, with the happy success of his Labours, and the great satisfaction of Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> the 4th. was by him de∣signed Cardinal, but upon his return, an indisposition seised him and deprived him of Life in <HI>Sutry,</HI> being but forty seaven yeers old, in <HI>Anno nostrae salutis</HI> 1445. <HI>Francesco Lignamineo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ferrara</HI> and Apostolick Legate was by Pope <HI>Engenius</HI> the 9th. designed Cardi∣nal, but he was prevented by his death in the yeer 1412. <HI>Antonio Giannotti</HI> a famous Lawyer, Bishop of <HI>Forli,</HI> and Arch-Bishop of <HI>Ur∣bin,</HI> was Vice Legate in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Bologna,</HI> where he dyed at his 65th. yeer, being then by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. designed Cardinal <HI>Anno</HI> 1591.</P>
<P>In the Palace of the Bishop these things are worth a sight, The most ample diocess of <HI>Padoua,</HI> drawn in a large square by <HI>Marco Cornaro</HI> Bishop of <HI>Padoua</HI> a Prelate worthy of eternal memory, and a great Hall where to the life (as is believed) are drawn the Pictures of 112 B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>shops of this most antient and Noble City. The Church of Saint <HI>Antonio</HI> of <HI>Lisbone</HI> merits the second Place amongst <HI>Padoua's</HI> fair Churches, as well for the design and artifice, as for the pretious∣ness of the Marbles and other Ornaments. The Roof of this Temple is distinguished into six marvellous Chapels covered with Lead. First must be seen the Royal Chapel of this Saint, adorned with the finest Marbles, and 12 Noble Collumns, in the nine spa∣ces of which Columns between the one and tother, are engraven his Miracles by the most rare Sculptors of that Age, so well that it renders the spectators stupified. In the midst of which Chapel ari∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>es the Altar of this Saint, and within it lies entered his body. Upon

This Saint having lived 36 yeers dyed the 13th of <HI>June</HI> 1231, and was canonized by <HI>Gregory the</HI> 9th. in the City of <HI>Spoleto,</HI> in the yeer 1237. On which day in <HI>Padoua</HI> they go in procession carrying his Tongue in a little woodenBoul with great solemnity and superstition; which is accompanyed with all the Fry∣ers of Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> that is to say, by the Conventuals <HI>Capucines,</HI> and those that go uppon woodden Pattens called <HI>Zoccolani,</HI> and with all the Doctors of the Colleges, as well of the Laws, and Physick, as those of Divinity and Philosophy; wherewith they also carry all the Vessels of Silver and other pretious things bestowed upon this their Saint, as also an infinite number of their holy Re∣liques preserved in curious Vessels: Among which are the Figures of ten Saints of pure Silver, 16 rich Chalices, 50 Vessels, 3 whereof are to contayn their Eucharist, many Silver Candlesticks, Lampades, Censores, and 50 Sylver Votaries or pieces dedicated by the vowes of several persons, which are as big as a small Child. Likewise a Shipp furnished with Masts, Sayls and Shrouds, together with a model of the City of <HI>Padoua</HI> both being neatly cast in Silver. In a fayr Re∣liquiary they preserve the Tongue of the glorious Saint <HI>Anthonio</HI> and in another his under Chap. In others all of Silver guilt framed with most exact workemanshipp, they keep a cloth dipped in the preti∣ous blood (as they say) of our Saviour Jesus▪ Christ; three thornes of his Crown; some of the wood of his Cross; of the hairs and milk of the blessed Virgin; some of the Blood issuing out of the five wounds given Saint <HI>Francesoo;</HI> and many of the Bones and other rare reliques of infinite of their Saints, as may be seen in the Treatise published by Count <HI>Giacomo Zabarella</HI> Praesident and Treasurer of the Venerable Tombe of the glorious Saint <HI>Antonio:</HI> Who (befides the revenue of the Convent wherewith the Fathers are maintein ed) possesseth a great Revenue, together with much Silver and other pretious househouldstuff, all bestowed upon that Saint by Princes, and private Persons, which Wealth is governed by seaven Presi∣dents, vulgarly called the <HI>Signori all' Archa di San Antonio;</HI> three Ecclesiasticks and 4 Seculars, with a Casheer, who receives the Re∣venues, and pays the Musicians and other disbursements, which Officers are elected every yeer, and every Six Moneths two of them change. In the Convent is a fayr publick Library, much amplified by the reverend Father <HI>Francesco Zanotti,</HI> an eminent Person of <HI>Pa∣doua,</HI> who alwaies governed his Convent with great prudence as <HI>Guardian,</HI> and his Religious Order whereof he was Provincial: where∣to the most reverend Father <HI>Michael Angelo Maniere Guardian</HI> and Provincial also hath added his Industry with great success and e∣vidence of his Prudence, Virtue and Goodness; both whose good Actions have given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> great Splendour to the Fame of this most No∣ble Convent. Near to this said Library is another Room wherein are kept the rare collections of Count <HI>Giacomo Zabarella,</HI> given to the said Saint; which consists of many excellent Books and Manuscripts, and all the Histories (in being) of <HI>Padoua, Venice</HI> and other Cities

which no where else are to be found, also of Medals, Marbles, brass Pieces and other notable Antiquities, with the Golden Key, and all his workes, all which being before fully related, are here abbreviated to avoid Prolixity.</P>
<P>Opposite to the Altar of Saint <HI>Antonio</HI> is the Chapel of Saint <HI>Fe∣lix</HI> the Pope of like <HI>grandezza:</HI> where also repose his Bones; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ound about which are hung Pictures excellently wrought by <HI>Giotto,</HI> wher∣of <HI>Daute, Boccacio</HI> and other writers take particular notice: In it are the Tombes of the <HI>Signori Rossi</HI> and <HI>Lupi</HI> Marqueses of <HI>Soragna;</HI> and next the Chapel of Saint <HI>Antonio,</HI> with which it▪ maintains like Grandure and Fame, it is the most eminent of all; the greater Altar whereof is richly carved in Marble, and hath on the right side a Candlestick of a very great heighth, and wrought with many Fi∣gures, &amp; over against it an artificial Chorus adorned with lovely Fi∣gures carved in wood: In this Church likewise are the Sepulchers of <HI>Fulgosio</HI> of <HI>Marin,</HI> and <HI>Ascanio Zabarella,</HI> the first famous in Let∣ters, the second in Arms; which are erected in the Chapel of Saint <HI>Catherine</HI> appertaining to their Family; in another Tombe lies buried <HI>Andrea Zabarella</HI> with <HI>Montisia Polenta</HI> his Wife, Daugh∣ter of <HI>Bernardino</HI> Signor of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> with many other eminent per∣sons, which would take up too much room and time to specifie. Before the said Church stands a noble Statue of Brass cast by <HI>Donato Fiorentino,</HI> and presented to the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> in memory of the Valour of <HI>Gattamelata da Narni,</HI> who was Captain General of their Armies: whose effigies is there erected on Horseback, and whose body with that of his Sons ly buried in the Chapel of Saint <HI>Francis</HI> with two fayr Epitaphs inscribed over them.</P>
<P>The third ecclesiastick excellency of <HI>Padoua,</HI> is the sumptuous and ample Church of Saint <HI>Justina,</HI> where are kept with great de∣votion the bodies of Saint <HI>Luke</HI> the Evangelist; Saint <HI>Matthias</HI> the Apostle, of the Innocents, of Saint <HI>Prosdocimo</HI> first Bishop of this City and Province, of <HI>Santa Giustina</HI> the Virgin Martyr, of <HI>Giulian</HI> of <HI>Massimo</HI> second Bishop of <HI>Padoua,</HI> of <HI>Urio</HI> the Consessor, of <HI>Feli∣cita</HI> the Virgin, <HI>Arnaldo</HI> the Abbot; together with an infininte number of Reliques, which they preserved ina most Antient Ceme∣tery called in those days the Pit of Martyrs: there also stands a speck∣led stone, upon which certain Martyrs were beheaded, another stone whereon <HI>San Prosdocimo</HI> celebrated divine service: Herein likewise they conserve the Tablet of the blessed Virgin paynted by Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> and with great devotion brought from <HI>Constantinople</HI> by the blessed <HI>Urio.</HI> Its Chorus which compasseth the high Altar round, is made all of Walnut Tree, and upon it engraven by <HI>Richardo Fran∣cesco</HI> the History of the Old and New Testament. It hath much Silver Utensils and pretious vests; to say no more, this Chapel for its stru∣cture and beauty, is an incomparable piece; And not a little illu∣strated by that proud aod wealthy Monastery of Saint <HI>Justine</HI> now contiguous with it, which for its sumptuousness, Grandure, and Riches, may be reckoned one of the Fairest of <HI>Italy.</HI> On the Walls of the Cloysters amongst the Legend stories designed, they have in∣serted hundreds of old inscriptions, with the draughts of old stones and pieces of Urns dug up when the foundation of the Convent was first Layed. It hath for revenue 100000. Crowns yeerly. It

<P>The fourth signal, is the Church of Saint <HI>Augufiino,</HI> of the Fathers Dominicans: which was first a Temple of <HI>Juno,</HI> wherein the Antient <HI>Padouans</HI> dedicated the spoils of <HI>Cleonimus</HI> the <HI>Spartan,</HI> as saith <HI>T. Livie.</HI> Thence it became the Particular Chapel of the <HI>Car∣raresi,</HI> who there fixed the Sepulchers for their Family. Where al∣so are the Monuments of <HI>Marieta,</HI> Mother of <HI>James King</HI> of <HI>Ciprus,</HI> and <HI>F.

It hath a Stately Convent with a fayr Library, where are the Pictures of the chief Fathers of that Order.</P>
<P>The fifth Marvel is the Church of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> famous for its vast height, and grandure, with one only Arch, and a most high Cupulo; Its Chapels are all of one resemblance, and in great perfection: Herein they keep an Image of the blessed Virgin, who, as they say, showrs down her continued favours upon those that devoutly by her intercession pray for them to God Almighty. In this Church are certain Monuments of the <HI>Naldi,</HI> Famous Captains, and many o∣ther Noble Families of <HI>Padoua.</HI></P>
<P>The Sixth Ecclesiastick wonder, is the Church of <HI>Eremitani,</HI> wherein lies buried <HI>Marco Mantoua,</HI> the famous Doctor of Lawes. Here are the Chapels of the <HI>Cortellieri,</HI> painted by <HI>Giusto</HI> an antient Lymner, and of the <HI>Zabarella,</HI> by the hand of <HI>Montegna.</HI></P>

they might the more commodiously search into the nature &amp; vertue of every Medicinal Herb: The chief care and custody of this Gar∣den, is alwayes committed to some excellent Doctor in Physick, who Reads to the Students, the names and nature of every Simple; in the latter times <HI>Melchior Guillandino, Giacomo Antonio Cortuso,</HI> and <HI>Prospero Alpino,</HI> three excelling Persons underwent this charge, but at present tis in the hands of the learned <HI>Giovanni Vestlinghi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> or <HI>Westlingius,</HI> a Knight and Anatomy▪ Reader in the University.

<P>Ten miles out of <HI>Padoua,</HI> towards the Port of <HI>Malomocco,</HI> stands the Castle <HI>Pieve de Sacco,</HI> from which the Bishop of <HI>Padoua</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polverara.</NOTE> takes his Title of Count, a little beyond that, stands <HI>Polverara</HI> where are bred the largest foul, as Cocks and Hens, of all <HI>Italy.</HI> Near which begins the Sholes or Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> between which appears the most antient now deserted Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y of <HI>Adria</HI> which formerly gave the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adria.</NOTE> name of <HI>Mare Adriaticum,</HI> to the Sea now called the Golph of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the North stands the Castle <HI>di Campo San Piero,</HI> whence that Noble Family took its name and Original. Between <HI>Padoua</HI> and <HI>Bassano</HI> is built a Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>adel.</P>
<P>Towards the West is the City <HI>Vicenza▪</HI> with the famous Moun∣tains<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euganei.</NOTE> <HI>Euganei,</HI> so called in the Greek tongue, for their excessive de∣liciousness; whence the <HI>Padouans</HI> extract great quantities of Medi∣cinal herbs.

twas not possible the World could afford a place more full of de∣lights. At five miles distance from <HI>Padoua,</HI> are extant the Baths of <HI>Albano,</HI> where is to be admir'd the different kinds of Waters: how out of a vast high cavernous Rock arises two sources of Water not above 2 foot one from the other, of a perfect different nature; the one whereof encrusts &amp; converts into a hard white stone, not only the Banks by which it runs, but what ever els is cast into it, in crea∣sing the saidc rustment of what is thrown in, according to the time tis left in it, and that which is more, it begets Stone of the same na∣ture upon the wheel of a Mill which is turned by its stream, which every Moneth enforces the workemen to beat it off with <HI>Pickaxes</HI> that their Mill may not be hindred; the Water hereof is never drunk by any creature, being held very hurtfull; but the other Water runs upon a light Sand, is much more light in weight than the first, and is divers times drank for sundty healthfull operatiōs: the people have dug the Earth in parts round the said Hill, and have found Sulphure, about the middle part, and at the root of them having dug towards the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>South</HI> parts they have found Salt. <HI>Abano</HI> at this day is nothing so much inhabited as we ought to believe it was heretofore; by reason that upon any digging they often find un∣derground, many Reliques of Antiquity; some also will have it that here they spun the finest Linnen Cloth. On the other side of <HI>Abano</HI> stands the sumptuous and rich Monastery of <HI>Praia,</HI> with the black Monks of Saint <HI>Renedict:</HI> and near it the Church of <HI>Santa Ma∣ria di Monte Ortone.</HI> Approaching whereunto is the Convent of the Fryars Ermitans of Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> called <HI>Scalci,</HI> or without Shoos in which are sources of boyling water, and mud, excellent for pains and shrunk sinews: though the difficulty with which they are come at, renders them of less common use than they would be, for they are a vast way in the Earth, and in small quantities too: but they are of a white colour, and stiff as well wrought clay; not black and dirty as those which are commonly gotten out of the adjacent <HI>Montagnone.</HI> They pass from <HI>Padoua</HI> to <HI>Estè</HI> upon the Ri∣ver, and upon the way espy the noble Castle of <HI>Monselice,</HI> (enviro∣ned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monselice</NOTE> with most pleasant Hills) also the foundations of a ruinated fortress, where they gather infinite numbers of Vipers, for the composing of that so much famed <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle: On the left side whereof is the Hill <HI>Arquato Contrada,</HI> much spoken of in memory of <HI>Franc▪ Petrarca,</HI> whose habitation being long there, at length he gave up the Ghost, and was there honourably interred in a sepul∣chre of Marble, with this Epitaph enscribed, which himself made, as followes.

Eight miles far∣ther is <HI>Lendinara,</HI> a very strong Castle &amp; Town washed with the River <HI>Adice:</HI> but the Ayr is a little gross in the Winter time, it contayns 4000 Souls. Near which is the Castle <HI>Sanguienedo,</HI> in the Con∣fines between the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Mantoua:</HI> where there is a fayr even way for eighteen miles length.

Many Illustrious Persons have added to the Glory of this their Countrey, as the Cardinal <HI>Roverella, Brusoneo</HI> the Poet, <HI>Celio,</HI> the <HI>Riccobuoni,</HI> and <HI>Gio Tomaso Minadoi</HI> a most learned Physician, who wrote the <HI>Persian History,</HI> with other famous men. It hath a Church dedicated to Saint <HI>Bellino,</HI> heretofore Bishop of <HI>Padoua,</HI> the Priests whereof with miraculous success restore to health such as are bit by mad Dogs, whom they as suddainly cure as indubitably, with a certain exorcism, which if malignity proceeded in a natural course of Physick, would not only require the best skill but length of time. Whosoever reads the 36th Ch. of the 6th. Book of <HI>Diosc.</HI> and those other Tractates writ on that infirmity, may comprehend how great this miracle is. <HI>Mathioli</HI> in the cited fol. of <HI>Diosc.</HI> owned the success, and willing to deduce it from some na∣tural cause, saith, that possibly these Priests might intermix some medicinal herb or secret with that bread which they are wont to bless for Dog-bitten Mad Persons: but this may easily be answe∣red, For this Church is governed by two poor Priests who many times desert it; nor are they of a selected condition; and twere strange if since the time of Saint <HI>Bellino</HI> to this day none should arrive

therebut he must bring that medicinal secret with him▪ Secondly they give but one little morcel of that blessed bread to a person, and it can scarce be imagined enough of the medicine should be conteyned in so small a parcel of Bread, for so wonderfully a dangerous di∣sease.

<P><HI>VIcenza</HI> is now seated in the <HI>Marca Trivigiana,</HI> or the Marqui∣sate of <HI>Ireves,</HI> It was built (according to <HI>Livie, Justine,</HI> and <HI>Paulo Diacono</HI>) by the <HI>Galli Senoni,</HI> who fell down into <HI>Italy</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> giving the name of <HI>Gallia Cisalpi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>a,</HI> to that part possessed by them: But <HI>Strabo, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Polyb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> will have it to be founded by the Antient <HI>Tuscans,</HI> and that it was one of the twelve Cities under their dominion, on this side of the <HI>Apenines,</HI> and that it was much encreased and amplified by the <HI>Galli Senones.</HI> When afterwards the Cities thereabouts performed good service for Omnipotent <HI>Rome,</HI> at the descent of other French men, in the yeer 366. into <HI>Italy,</HI> and at their Assayling of <HI>Rome, Vicenza</HI> being one of them, in recompence of their assistance so oportunely con∣tributed, was created <HI>Municipal,</HI> a Free City: whence exercising their own Laws and Statutes they participated of the honours and dignities of <HI>Rome;</HI> and thence tis we find so many of its Citizens in the Magistracy of that grand Republick, among others, <HI>Aulus Cecinna,</HI> the Consul, was General of the Army of <HI>Vitellius</HI> the Em∣perour, In whose honour (because he so much surpassed the fame of an ordinary Citizen) It will not be impertinent to place here this following antient inscription.

<P>To it was allotted also the Title of Republick and City, as is to be seen in many antient Marble Stones up and down the Countrey, and twas assigned to the Tribe <HI>Menenia.</HI> It was under the protecti∣on of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> as appears in his familiar Epistles, and in this antient inscribed memorial:

<P>All the time the Roman Empire continued in its Grandezza, it

ever followed the victorious Eagle, which decaying, this also suf▪ fered much Calamity, and underwent those mutations, which it and all the Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ned under with miserable example: Not at all, nevertheless, declining from its antient Vigour and Re∣putation: Whence it was that the <HI>Longobardi</HI> held it very conside∣rable, and assigned to it, Its own particular Dukes and Counts, Those Governours calling themselves by that Title, for that they continued for life, and to their Heirs <HI>masculines</HI> after them: Of one of whom <HI>Paolo Diacono</HI> makes a noble record in the life of <HI>Leon</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peredeo</NOTE> Emperor, which was <HI>Peredeo</HI> Duke of <HI>Vicenza,</HI> who marched to <HI>Ravenna</HI> in assistance to the Pope, and there dyed fighting valiantly for his Holiness.</P>
<P>This City was by <HI>Desiderio</HI> the last King of the <HI>Longobardi</HI> selected amongst all his, to place securely his Son <HI>Aldigerio,</HI> when himself was besiged in <HI>Pavia,</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the great; but it avoided not its total destruction.</P>
<P>The Reliques of its antient Theatre, which at this day demon∣strate themselves in the Gardens of the <HI>Signori Pigafetta,</HI> and <HI>Gual∣di</HI> (wherein both the Kings of the <HI>Longobardi</HI> and those of <HI>France</HI> often sate to behold the publick shewes and Games) And the frag∣ments of the hot Bathes, with the Pilasters for the Aqueducts, give sufficient testimony that it had no defect of whatsoever, either for Ornament or magnificence, other famous Cities use to enjoy. And at that time when <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>arius</HI> the Emperor endeavoured in <HI>Rome,</HI> in the yeer 825, to reform the occasion of the <HI>Feudes,</HI> and to that end con∣vocated the principal Lawyers of the primary Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> He also invited the <HI>Vicentine</HI> Counsellors with an honourable testimony of what esteem he had for the City <HI>Vicentia.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore when <HI>Ottone</HI> King of <HI>Germanie</HI> (the <HI>Berengarii</HI> being overcome and discomfited) was by the Pope crowned Emperor, he remised the <HI>Italian</HI> Cities in Liberty, granting unto them Power to elect their <HI>Podestà</HI> or chief Governour, and to enjoy their own Laws, among the rest <HI>Vicenza</HI> participated of that so great a gift: Whence forming a <HI>Carrocio</HI> or Chariot which was the Badge of a free City, and acknowleging the Empire with the ordinary Tribute, it lived in the form of a Republick, (although much perplexed with the most cruel factions of its own Citizens) until the yeer 1143. When <HI>Federico Barbarrossa</HI> having gathered the utmost of his Power, forced all the Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> into servitude, and destroying <HI>Milan,</HI> in the rest constituted a German <HI>Podesta</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vicenza</HI> endured not long this Tyranny, but united with <HI>Padoua</HI> and <HI>Verona,</HI> they shoke off the yoke, and sent the first Embassadors to the <HI>Milanesi</HI> to offer them assistance, and to perswade them to do the like; and so they concluded the famous League of the Cities of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> by which Colleagues <HI>Barbarossa</HI> (being overcome be∣tween <HI>Como</HI> and <HI>Milan</HI>) was driven to the other side of the <HI>Alpes.</HI> Which victory the peace of <HI>Costanza</HI> followed, to the conclusion whereof came also the Orators of <HI>Vicenza,</HI> where they megliora∣ted enough their Cities Condition, and the state of their Liberty, chiefly for that <HI>Henry</HI> the Son and successor of <HI>Federick</HI> confirmed the abovenamed Peace with all the conditions conceded by his Fa∣ther: All the Embassadors of the Colleagued Cities randezvousing

<P>In those dayes the Republicks Library flourished in this City with infinite cōcourse of Forein Nations, abounding with the most worthy Professors in all the sciences and Arts, which it appears continued to the yeer 1228. In which yeer <HI>Federick</HI> the second being exalted to the Empire, an extream Enemy to the Pope and Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> af∣ter many ruines whch he brought on others, in the yeer 1236 burnt and destroyed <HI>Vicenza;</HI> exercising his greatest cruelty against the most potent Citizens, which reduced it with great ease under the wicked Tyrant <HI>Eccellino,</HI> continuing so until his death, when waving and debilitated, it by degrees crawled up the steps of its Antient Liberty; yet not so strongly, but that after 46 yeers it un∣derwent by the Citizens neglect, the Signory of the <HI>Scaligeri,</HI> who there governed under the shadow and name of an Empire: and that title not improperly taken, for that <HI>Can Grande</HI> at that time their head, was a most valiant and potent Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Vicenza</HI> was well treated under their government, and many publick Edifices restored, but the wheele of Fortune running round, and the Line of those Lawfull Signors extinct, <HI>Antonio</HI> the last of them and illegitimate, was first deprived of <HI>Verona,</HI> then of <HI>Vi∣cenza,</HI> by <HI>Gio Galleazze</HI> first Viscount of <HI>Milan,</HI> by whom it was held very dear, and so much honoured for its fidelity, that he made it the Chamber of his Empire.</P>
<P>He dead <HI>Catarina</HI> his Wife distrusting her own ability to maintain so great Dominions, by her Letters full of Courtesy, absolving their Oath of fidelity, gave the <HI>Vicentines</HI> ample Liberty to elect their own Government, who after divers consultations and many solicitations to colleague themselves with the <HI>Switzers,</HI> and to be∣come one of their Cantons, having at large supervised the great calamities of the passed times, and fearing future miseries, At length the Advice of <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rico Capra</HI> (a wise and esteemed Citizen of great Interest both for his many adherents and riches) prevailed to surrender themselves of their own free accords to the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> whose pleasing Goverment was then become famous through the whole world. Who accepting with all Gratitude this their free offer, confirmed unto them all such Jurisdictions, Sta∣tutes, &amp; Prerogatives, as they knew how to demand; and in particu∣lar the Consularship the most Antient Magistracy of this City, and received it into protection, styling it the first Born and most faith∣full City, under whose Signory it hath ever since continued, dayly encreasing both their Wealth, and conveniences.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, at the Inroad of <HI>Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>radada,</HI> the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> (though unwillingly) gave way to the Signory of the whole firm Land; by which means <HI>Vicenza</HI> fell into the hands of <HI>Massimi∣nian</HI> the Emperor, who sent thither <HI>Leonardo Trissino,</HI> to receive possession thereof, as Vicar of the Empire, which he performed there, as also in <HI>Padoua:</HI> Who with <HI>Vicentia,</HI> through the great af∣fection they bore the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the singular Pru∣dence of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate within some few yeers after easily re∣turned to their former Obedience under it.</P>

<P>They erected a Theatre by the invention of <HI>Andreo Palladio</HI> the Renovator of the good and antient Architecture (capable of 5000 persons in their Seats) as by this inscription appears.

<P>The Stage, or Scene, is a stupendious thing to behold, for the many Statues and Corinthian Pillars; the Prospective represents a Royal City, where was first performed, with great Applause, and in∣credible satisfaction to the whole Province, in the yeer 1585: the re∣presentation of <HI>Epidus</HI> Tyrant of <HI>Soffocles,</HI> acted with lordly pomp, as well in the habits, as musick, <HI>Chorus,</HI> and illumination of the Theatre: The Olympick Academy (to whom we owe this work) ought therefore to be thanked as the receptable of the Muses, and all other noble and elevated ingenuities. The <HI>Vicentines</HI> chiefly have the obligation for this work, to the memory of the Cavalier <HI>Chieregato</HI> Governour of all the Militia of the Kindome of <HI>Candy,</HI> and restorer of all the antient and good discipline for the Infantery.</P>
<P>Besides that Olympick it hath another Academy more modern for Horse, founded, by the Count <HI>Oderico Capra</HI> Leader for his Highness of one hundred Men in Arms, not less usefull for the Exercise of the Youth, than for the manage it gives the Horses, with much profit to the Prince in warlike Occurrences, where good Masters Riders are well entertained.</P>

<P><HI>Schio</HI> is a principal Town, Seated at the feet of those Mountaines, at 15. miles distance from the City, filled with Merchandize and modities; it conteins five thousand Souls, a People neat and civil as well as Warlike.

Souls, <HI>Martial</HI> calls her great, and <HI>Strabo</HI> most great.

then adorned with Sculptures, Collumns, Statues, and other fair Marbles. Besides, in the City are many things from whence may be gathered. That it hath been a most antient and Noble City: Un∣der the Castle of <HI>San Pietro,</HI> they yet shew the great foundations of a Theatre with the entire doors of the <HI>Scene,</HI> as also the Signal of that place which was antiently deputed for the Naval Fights, in that place, where now is the Orchards of the Fathers Dominicans. In the <HI>Piazza de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> stands the most antique and great Fabrick, the Amphitheatre built of square Marble Stones, called by the <HI>Veronei</HI> the <HI>Arena.</HI> The outward wall, whereof had four fair Rows of Pil∣lars Arches and Windows, composed of four forts of Architecture, that is to say, one Dorick, one Ionick, one Corinthian, and one mixed with good order, being a Structure not less fair than high, as may be credited from that little part which yet is a foot. The <HI>Barba∣rous</HI> who sacked <HI>Italy,</HI> disrobed it of all the Marble Stones and Or∣naments of the exteriour circuit, even to the foundations where∣with to adorn their other Structures leaving that so Noble work, de∣prived of all its Majesty; howbeit from those small reliques remain∣ing, one may take a judgement of the grandure and quality of the rest, as easily, as from the nails may be guessed what creature a Lyon is, because the Reason and art of Architecture, and circular proportions make it easily comprehended; that every one of the said Orders or degrees of the exteriour Wall, had seventy two parts or as one would say, Arches and as many Pillars; and from the void places in the third order, which was the Corinthian, one may know that there were 144. Statues between the Arches, and Pillars; Being entred at the Porches, which within encompass the whole Fabrick in three orders, one would wonder at the great number of Stayrs Steps &amp; waies, which on every side were used by the Spectators to go in and out without disturbance. Who might altogether (although a great multitude) mount and descend with great facility and no trouble by those numberless ways In the midst is the <HI>Arena,</HI> and tis a noble sight to behold that spatious plain of an Oveal form, 34 per∣ches long, and 22½ broad, environed with 42.

<P>Tis known that a little distant thence was the place where the Sword players exercised, and to this day are to be seen, the foot∣steps of the Arch Triumphal erected in honour of <HI>C.

<P>In the <HI>Via Emilia,</HI> were many four squared Arches of Marble, three whereof, we now behold, one of which was built by <HI>Vetruvius</HI> and shews 'twas framed with true rules of Architecture. In <HI>Verona</HI> are many other Signes, of Venerable Antiquity, as great Ruins of her Houses, with many Chambers adorned with figures, composed of several pieces of Stones, of Temples, of Arches, Triumphals, Palaces, Aquiducts, Collumns, Statues, Epitaphs, Medals, of Gold and Silver, Urns and the like, which by the firing that <HI>Attila</HI> King of the <HI>Hunns,</HI> put to it, were lost and destroyed: the aPvements, in some places being thereby become twenty foot under ground. This City, hath many sumptuous Palaces, and among them the Council house, or Chamber of Justice is the chief, of a square form, with 4. Halls, and one square low Court, wherein there is so much room, that they therein do Justice, and hold Council at the same time, comodiously: upon the roof whereof stand exposed to the ayr the Statues of <HI>Cornelius, Nepos, Emilius, Marcus,</HI> old Poets, of <HI>Pliny</HI> the natural Historian, and <HI>Vetruvius</HI> the Architecture, and in a very high Arch, the Statue of <HI>Hieronimo Facastrao,</HI> all which men graced their Mother <HI>Verona</HI> by their singular virtues.</P>
<P>Besides which, there are two Palaces for the Governours and many others eminent enough of particular <HI>Veronians.</HI> They praise also the great Bell, which is in the high Turret, The <HI>Piazza</HI> frequen∣ted by the Merchants; the Burrough where they teazlle wash and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ss Clothes, and the Field called <HI>Campo Martio,</HI> where they exer∣cise the Souldiery.

<P><HI>Verona</HI> was under the <HI>Etrurians,</HI> the <HI>Euganei,</HI> the <HI>Heneti,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> with whom it was confederated and had voices in the <HI>ballottinges</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> never sent a Colony into <HI>Vero∣na,</HI> but it was ascribed to the <HI>Tribu Poblilia,</HI> and the <HI>Veronians</HI> have had many Magistrates in <HI>Rome.</HI> Heretofore 4. Deputies had the clear and mixt government of this City, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Consuls, which 4. were created by the Citizens, together with the other Magistrates: whereof they yet retein some shadow by having Consuls, the wise men, the Counsel of twelve, the hundred and twenty, and the Prefect of the Merchants. Afterwards the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire decli∣ning, <HI>Verona</HI> became under the Command of certain barbarous Ty∣rants, but they being driven out by the <HI>Ostragoths</HI> and they by the <HI>Longobards</HI> who were Lords of it 200. yeers, it was finally freed from their Signory and fell into the power of the successors of <HI>Charles</HI> the great, that is of <HI>Pipin</HI> and <HI>Berengarius,</HI> and others who there made the Seat of their Empire, as <HI>Albano</HI> King of the <HI>Longobardi,</HI> had done formerly.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Ottone</HI> the First, it again recovered its Liberty; but discords arising among the Citizens, it was opprest by the Tyranny of <HI>Ezzelino,</HI> and the <HI>Scaligiri,</HI> its own Citizens, who Lorded it for 200. yeers, Last of all being also opprest by others, it voluntarily ren∣dred it self to the power of the <HI>Venetians</HI> who in those daies, were e∣steemed the Justest of Lords. It was converted to the Christian Faith by <HI>Euperius,</HI> commissionated to preach there from Saint <HI>Peetre.</HI> It had thirty six Bishops Saints, with <HI>S. Zenone</HI> its Protector, to whom <HI>Pipin</HI> Son of Charles the great, dedicated a Church with twelve pounds of gold for yeerly revenue. The greater Church, is a most noble one, and rich with a Chapter of Canons of much authority. In the Church of <HI>S.

They were <HI>Veronians</HI> that have their five Statues set upon the pu∣blick Palace: So also was the learned <HI>Scaliger,</HI> for whose sake and his Family (<HI>i Signori della Scala</HI>) is erected in the heart of the City a Stately Marble Tomb, encompassed with Iron work, resembling a Ladder, which that name implies. It hath afforded some Women too, so well read in the Greek and Latin tongue, and the Sciences, that they have held disputes with many learned Men, among others <HI>Isotta Nogarola</HI> was glorious, it hath one Porphyre Tomb of a King of the <HI>Goths.</HI> In summ, <HI>Verona</HI> possesseth all those things that may render a Citty perfect, and its Citizens happy: So that tis no won∣der that many Emperors (induced by the beauty of the place) spent some Moneths of the yeer there, as we read in the codicils of <HI>Justi∣nian,</HI> and <HI>Theodosius,</HI> and that <HI>Alboino,</HI> first King of the <HI>Longobards,</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI> Son of <HI>Charls</HI> the Great, and <HI>Berengarius,</HI> with other Kings; of <HI>Italy,</HI> selected it for their own Residences; and to the end no or∣nament might be wanting, instituted an Academy for good Letters, and Study of humanity in the house of the Signori <HI>Bevilacque,</HI> where∣of <HI>Cota</HI> a good Poet of our times saies well thus.

That part looking towards the <HI>South,</HI> begins from the <HI>Porta Nova,</HI> and goes to <HI>Lonigo a Cologna,</HI> wherein is nothing remarkable, more than its fertility, and the head of the River <HI>Tartaro;</HI> and on that side towards <HI>Mantoua,</HI> 17. miles distant from <HI>Verona,</HI> is the Island <HI>Scala,</HI> so well replenished with people and goods, that it hath in some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scala.</NOTE> sort the face of a City.</P>
<P>Towards the <HI>West,</HI> before <HI>Verona,</HI> lies a Stony untild Champion or Downs, but famous for divers deeds of Arms there, performed by great Captains; Tis said, that <HI>Sabino Giuliano,</HI> who would have got∣ten the Empire, was there by <HI>Carino Cesare</HI> overthrown and flain, that <HI>Odouacro</HI> King of the <HI>Herlui,</HI> and <HI>Turcillingi,</HI> having by violence obteyned the Kingdome of <HI>Italy,</HI> forcing out <HI>Augustolo,</HI> and therein tyranized some yeers, was in this place discomfited in a Battel of three days, by <HI>Theodorick</HI> King of the <HI>Ostrogoths;</HI> That <HI>Lamberto</HI> Son of <HI>Guidon</HI> King of <HI>Spoleto,</HI> was there overcome with 14000. <HI>Hunga∣rian</HI> Souldiers by <HI>Berengarius.</HI> That some yeers after, by <HI>Gugone Are∣latense, Arnoldo</HI> Captain of <HI>Baviera,</HI> with a potent Army of <HI>Germans,</HI> was there cut in pieces, whom the <HI>Veronians</HI> first called into <HI>Italy</HI> for King against <HI>Hugone,</HI> and had received into their City as victori∣ous and triumphant. That there likeness was overcome and depri∣ved of his Kingdom the second <HI>Berengarius</HI> by <HI>Rodolfus Borgondus;</HI> and that in antient times in that place were fought many Battels (of no less consequence than obaining or losing of the Kingdom of <HI>Italy</HI>) with various success. But as to what <HI>Biondo</HI> saith, that in that Down <HI>C.

<P>ANtiently the Castle <HI>Benaco,</HI> gave name to this Lake, where now is <HI>Tusculano,</HI> but at present it takes name from <HI>Gardo</HI> aforenamed.

<P>This Lake affords well-relisht fish, in great plenty, but chiefly Trouts, Carps, and Eels, whereof <HI>Pliny</HI> speaks at large.

<P>BRescia by the <HI>Romans Brixia,</HI> is seated 20 miles from <HI>Disensano,</HI> which a direct Road leads unto, but something Stoney. Some will have it called <HI>Brescia</HI> from <HI>Britein,</HI> which in the Language of the <HI>Galli Senones</HI> (the restorers of this City) signifie rejoycing Trees, as if the quantity of Fruits wherewith they are yeerly hung, made them rejoyce. <HI>Livie</HI> and other grave Authors write, that <HI>Brescia</HI> was built by the <HI>Galli Senones,</HI> in that age when the Kings commanded in <HI>Rome,</HI> and that the <HI>Romans</HI> made themselves Masters thereof, after they had conquered all <HI>Lombardy.</HI> They further say, that it alwaies kept inviolable Faith with the <HI>Roman</HI> People, and particularly in that calamitous time, when <HI>Hannibal</HI> destroyed their Armies. Besides they say, that it was reduced into a Colony of the <HI>Romans,</HI> after the asso∣ciated Warr, together with <HI>Verona,</HI> and the other Cities, on that fide the <HI>Po,</HI> by <HI>Cn. Pompeius Strabo,</HI> Father of <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, and a little time after <HI>Caesar</HI> reckoned the <HI>Brescians</HI> in the number of the <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens; under whose Empire it continued till its Majesty was at the height, when it was no less rich than potent, as may easily be conjectured from the many antient Marble Stones, and Statues, with the inscriptions and Epitaphs of illustrious Persons, and of divers famous deeds thereon which ly dispersed in the City and up and down its Territory.</P>
<P>Tis seated in a plain (at the foot of certain Hills) more long than broad; although but three miles in circuit, yet well replenished with dwellings and inhabitants. Its vicinity to the Hills beautifies it with many Fountains, a commodity which many Cities of <HI>Lombardi</HI> want. In it are many <HI>Piazzaes,</HI> the greatest whereof is that where the publick Palace is erected; which for its fairness, may be ac∣counted one of the Noblest Edifices of <HI>Italy.</HI> Under which Palace are fair Porches, with shops affording well tempered Belly pieces of Armour, Swords, Muskets, and other military Arms, which hath nominated it <HI>Brescia</HI> the Armed: other shops are no less furni∣shed with the finest Linnen cloth, a Commodity by which these Citi∣zens acquire great Riches. A small River called <HI>Garcia</HI> passeth thorow the City, which at its issuing forth is artificially drawn on this and that side to irrigate their Fields. It hath five Porrs or Gates, and one impregnable Castle, built with Stone upon a Hill. The <HI>Tor∣re de Pallada</HI> is of rare <HI>Tuscan</HI> work, and therein is the Great Bell of the City.

It received the light of the Christian Faith by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Domo</NOTE> the preaching of <HI>Sant Apollinare,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> in the yeer of our Lord, 119.

<P>Next is the Church of <HI>Santa Giulia</HI> the Martyr, built by <HI>Desideri∣us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Santa Juliia</NOTE> King of the <HI>Longobards,</HI> in the yeer 735. adorned with rich Vests and pretious vessels, and honoured with the bodies of many Saints, together with those of <HI>Ansilperga,</HI> the Sister, and <HI>Hermingarda</HI> the Daughter, of that King: which ly in its noble Monastery: wherein two daughters of <HI>Lotario</HI> the first Emperor, one sister of <HI>Charles</HI> the the third, one Daughter of <HI>Berengarus</HI> the Userper of the Empire, with many other Virgins of Royal blood, have spent their days in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ervice of God, under the Orders of Saint <HI>Benedict.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brescia</HI> is well replenished with People, and among them with ma∣ny noble and illustrious Families, as the <HI>Gambari,</HI> the <HI>Martinengi,</HI> the <HI>Magi,</HI> the <HI>Avogradi, Averoldi, Luzaghi, Emilii</HI> and others.

In some places (for want of Land either fit for tillage or Vines) the people employ themselves in working Woollen and Linnen Clothes, which they afterwards carry into all parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> Their Language is very rustick, but that renders not the People so, who are civil and ingenuous, and no less dispo∣sed to Learning than Trade, whence it took the surname of <HI>Bergamo</HI> the witty.</P>

Fryer <HI>Damiano,</HI> a convertite of the order of Prea∣chers, was a man of so great Ingenuity (in cementing pieces of seve∣ral woods together, with such artifice, that they have been often mistaken for Pictures drawn with a pencel) that his fellow hath not been known herein.

<P>The first Advancer of the Christian Religion in this City, was Saint <HI>Barnabas,</HI> a Disciple of Christ, in the 25th. yeer of our Salva∣tion; together with <HI>Anatolone</HI> the Greek, and <HI>Caio</HI> the Roman, gi∣ving it for Bishop <HI>Narino</HI> one of its Citizens; who having governed it with great sanctity of Life and Religion for thirty yeers, deceased, and was there interred: whom many holy Bishops from one to a∣nother have succeeded.</P>

<P><HI>Bergamo</HI> was long time subject to the Roman Empire; after whose fall twas burnt by <HI>Attila;</HI> then it was yoaked to the <HI>Longobardi,</HI> who styled themselves Dukes thereof; then reduced under the power of Kings of <HI>Italy:</HI> and so continued till the daies of <HI>Filippo Turciano,</HI> who became Lord thereof <HI>Anno</HI> 1264.

<P>THe Relation of this City should have been placed between the narrations of <HI>Brescia</HI> and <HI>Bergamo,</HI> where in the second voyage from <HI>Brescia</HI> to <HI>Milan</HI> tis only briesly touched, but the Author ha∣ving found himself tardy, in omitting an account of this esteemed one of the prime Cities of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> apollogizeth for his placing it here in the end of this Book, and promiseth a reformation in the next impress.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="43"/>Being then in the City of <HI>Brescia,</HI> and going forth the Gate <HI>San Nazario,</HI> after twenty miles travel you arrive at <HI>Orzi Nuovi:</HI> and ha∣ving past the River <HI>Oglio</HI> find the Castle <HI>Soncino:</HI> and sive miles more forwards meets <HI>Romanengo,</HI> and so many more the City <HI>Crema,</HI> which is situated in the <HI>East</HI> shore of the River <HI>Serio,</HI> by which tis delici∣ously washed; it lies in the Centre of fruitfull <HI>Lombardy,</HI> between five illustrious Cities, at thirty miles distance from each, which en∣compasse it like a Crown, whereof she may be termed the Cross, that is to say, <HI>Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona,</HI> and <HI>Piacenza,</HI> who affor∣ding it what it stands in need of, and expending its superfluities, concur in the rendring it a rich City, tis full of regard, and filled with Merchandize and a haughty self-conceited sort of men, but better illustrated by their gratious and loving Women, who flou∣rish, are free, and most pompous in their array. It is adorned with sumptuous and magnificent Fabricks, among which the most con∣spicuous are the publick Palace, the <HI>Piazza</HI> and the <HI>Domo</HI> with its Tower (wherein is a large Bell) of fair and open Architecture, with two regardfull Chapels, one dedicated to the blessed Virgin, all o∣ver garnished with excellent pictures, the other to Saint <HI>Mark</HI> no less beautified with gilt Images. Two other not able things this Church owns, to wit, that Wooden crucifix, which in <HI>Anno</HI> 144<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>▪ was cast into the Fire by a certain man called <HI>Giovanni Alchini,</HI> of the faction of <HI>Gibellina Bergamesca,</HI> which would not burn▪ but is still preser∣ved with the one side a little singed in a particular Chapel, with great Veneration, the other is a Key of <HI>San Bellino,</HI> which hath the foretold miraculous curing virtue of such as are bit by madd Doggs.</P>
<P>In the same Church are conserved certain trophies of Banners, and a Lanthern of a Gally, taken together with the Gally in a Naval fight against the Turks, by a Preacher of the most noble Family of <HI>Zurly,</HI> during the fight, being set at the head of the Gally. Besides the a∣bove named Fabricks and things worth seeing in this City, two Hospitals are valuable. One for the infirm, the other for the decre∣pit and outcasts: the sacred Mount of Piety is well endowed, and governed with great providence by the publick, to supply the neces∣sities of the City and Country.</P>
<P>There is also a noble Academy for Students, who under the name of <HI>Sospinti,</HI> employ themselves in good exercises with an impulse of generous emulation. Distant a quarter of a mile from the City stands (towards the Castle) a magnificent Temple of great devotion, named <HI>Santa Maria della Croce,</HI> of an admirable Structure, and adorned with many rare Pictures: To this noble and fair City, though Lit∣tle (as little best corresponds with little) belongs a small but most fertil Territory, washed all over with current and Christalline wa∣ters, which affords the City good Fish, as Lobsters, Trouts, Gudge∣ons, and Eels, and the Country an enriching of their soyl by over∣flowings, whereby it yeelds great plenty of Corn and Grass, the first whereof they have for their own use and other Cities, and with the second they make incomparable cheese.</P>
<P>But that wherewith it most abounds is Flax, which after made into the finest Drapery is spent all over <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>In its territories though small, are contained fifty four Villages,

and Towns, the chief whereof are, <HI>Monte dine, Stanengo, Camisano, Tetrore, Vaiano, Bagnelo, Madegnano,</HI> being all most populous.</P>
<P>The Original of this City, was taken from its situation, for be∣ing invironed then with the three Rivers, <HI>Ada, Oglio</HI> and <HI>Serio,</HI> it was very strong, and that strength as is believed invited many no∣ble men of the neighbouring Cities (in the time of the Wars of <HI>Albo∣nio</HI> King of the <HI>Longobards</HI>) to retire themselves thither, and from <HI>Cremete</HI> one of the chief of those Nobles it took its name. For Forty yeers it maintained it self in liberty, but then she with the other Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> suffered shipwrack, being by the <HI>Longobards, Frede∣rick Barbarossa</HI> and others, many times, taken, burnt, sacked, and destroyed, and subjugated sometimes to the Emperors, sometimes to the French, and sometimes to the <HI>Germans.</HI> But now tis gover∣ned by the most Serene Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> under whom it hath the privilege to keep every yeer a Fair beginning at the end of <HI>September</HI> being frequented with innumerable concourse of People, divers Merchandizes and Commodities, and great store of Cattle of all sorts.</P>

<HEAD>MILAN the great.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MIlan</HI> was an antient and illustrious City, and for a long time (through its beauty remained an imperial Seat.) Behind its shoulders rise those Mountains which separate <HI>Italy.</HI> Before it is a long and spatious Plain which extending it self above 200. miles, reacheth the Church lands between <HI>Rimio</HI> and <HI>Pesaro</HI> on the one side, and <HI>Istria</HI> and <HI>Osia,</HI> on the other side. Whereof <HI>Polibius</HI> writes thus. There is a plain, between the <HI>Alps</HI> and the <HI>Apennines</HI> of a triangular Forn, wherein are pleasant Fields above all the Fields not only of <HI>Italy</HI> but all <HI>Europe.</HI> Of which Triangle, the <HI>Apennines</HI> form one side, the <HI>Alps</HI> another, and the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea or Gulf of <HI>Venice</HI> (as it were the basis to the other two) makes up the third side.</P>
<P>And although <HI>Milan</HI> was heretofore a small Town, it was never∣theless much aggrandized and amplified by <HI>Belovese</HI> King of the <HI>Galls,</HI> having environed it with a Wall 24. foot broad, and 64. feet high, which compassed in all the Streets and round of the City: in which Wall were raised 130. Bulwarks, and Towers of immense bigness and heighth, which had six principal Gates. This was effect∣ed 270 yeers before <HI>Brenta</HI> King of the <HI>Senoni,</HI> fell down into <HI>Italy,</HI> who threw down and levelled it with the Foundations. But the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate having restored it to its first form and beauty, and be∣ing increased in Riches and People, <HI>Attila</HI> King of the <HI>Hunns</HI> descen∣ding into <HI>Italy,</HI> ruined it once more.</P>
<P>Afterwards, twas again rebuilt by the Arch-Bishop <HI>Eusebius,</HI> rearing the Wall again, and re-edifying the ruinated Building. And one hundred yeers after, that is in <HI>Anno Salutis</HI> 577. the <HI>Goths</HI> exer∣cised so great cruelty towards the <HI>Milanesi,</HI> that after they had cast
<PB N="65" REF="44"/>
down the Walls, and Edifices, they in one day slew thirty thou∣sand Citizens.</P>
<P>This City was likewise ill treated by <HI>Erimberto</HI> Brother of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and by <HI>Federick Barbarossa</HI> the Emperor: who with in∣tendment of its perpetual desolation ploughed &amp; sowed it w<SUP>th</SUP>. salt, but being afterwards reconciled to the Citizens, he restored it to its former beauty, encompassing it round with a wall, wherein were set out six principal Gates: At which time, <HI>viz.</HI> in the 1177. year, the circnit of it was six miles without the suburbs, but now there is a Wall drawn round, which comprehends therein the Su∣burbs also, which was done by <HI>Gonzaga</HI> Lieutenant of the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the 5th. and is in circumference ten miles, having very deep Fosses or Ditches, and ten Gates.</P>
<P>This City, before the coming of <HI>Belloveso,</HI> as is aforesaid, was but a Town called <HI>Subria</HI> built by the <HI>Tuscans,</HI> then <HI>Belloveso</HI> coming from <HI>Gallia,</HI> beat out the <HI>Tuscans,</HI> aggrandized and much beautified the Town: As to the name <HI>Mediolano,</HI> as formerly called, diverse are the opinions, some say twas so called for that it was seated be∣tween two Rivers, the <HI>Adda</HI> and the <HI>Tesino.</HI> Others say, that name was imposed on it by <HI>Belloveso</HI> by the command of the Gods, giving him to understand, that he should build a City where he should find a Farrowing Sow, half black and half white, with Wool between her shoulders: Whence finding such a Sow in that place, and esteeming it a good augure and praesage, he built it, naming it <HI>Mediolana,</HI> as much as to say, <HI>Meza Lana,</HI> or half Wool, in remembrance of which thing we find in a Marble over the Gate of the Palace of Merchants the shape and figure of the said <HI>Scrofa</HI> or Farrowing Sow.</P>
<P>The <HI>Galls</HI> kept the Dominion of this City, a long time, under <HI>Bel∣loveso</HI> and his Successors, till they were beaten out by the <HI>Romans,</HI> who subjected it for a great while to them, under whom it augmen∣ted in riches and People, chiefly under the Emperors as well Greek as Latine; some whereof much delighted to reside there, invited thereto by the beauty of the place, and the comodiousness of ma∣naging the Wars against the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> as necessity required. It so much humoured <HI>Trajan,</HI> the Emperor, that he there built that proud Palace which to this day retains his memory.</P>
<P><HI>Adrian, Massiminian, Hercules, Filippo</HI> a Christian Emperor, <HI>Con∣stantine, Constanzo, Theodosio,</HI> with many other Emperors, dwelt there, left most stately Edifices, and caused four Wi-draughts or Common shores to be dugg, which continue to this day. Afterwards it became subject to the <HI>Goths,</HI> and to the <HI>Longobards,</HI> who being driven out by <HI>Charls</HI> the great, it came under the power of the Emperors. In which time <HI>Contado Suevio</HI> being Emperor, it began to take boldness and aspire to Liberty, when Justice was administred by the Captains and other Officers elected by the People uniting with them the Pri∣mate or Arch-Bishop of the City, by the Peoples election: In which time great discord arising between the Nobility and Plebeians, and thereby governing themselves very ill, they to prevent those disor∣ders put themselves under the power of those of <HI>Torre,</HI> afterwards to the <HI>Visconti,</HI> who a great space kept the Dominion, whom the <HI>Sforzeschi</HI> succeeded, them the <HI>French,</HI> and last of all the house of <HI>Au∣stria</HI> obtained it, and keep it to this day in good peace and tran∣quillity.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="45"/><HI>Milan</HI> lies under the sixth Climate or Degree, which affords it a great benignity of the skies, yet the Ayr is somewhat thick. Cha∣nels of water environ both the City and Suburbs, upon which by Barks they conveigh great abundance of goods and provisions of all sorts. In truth tis a wonderfull thing to behold the great plenty of all things, for the life or necessity of Man, which are there, and tis held for certain, that in no other part of <HI>Europe▪</HI> there is so great provision for the Belly, nor at less price, than is here: whence the Proverb is taken <HI>Solo in Milano si mangia.</HI> For whereas in other Cities one finds not above three <HI>Piazzaes</HI> at most, where are kept sueh pub∣lick Markets, in <HI>Milan</HI> there are a hundred, whereof 21. are prin∣cipal, which every fourth day of the week are vastly laden with all sorts of Provisions: For wines they chiefly have <HI>Vernaccie</HI> of <HI>Mont∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rrat,</HI> and the Wines of <HI>Brianza</HI> so much spoken of: Moreover for that it is the Centre of <HI>Lombardi,</HI> hither they transport infinite quantities of Merchandize, from <HI>Germany, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>Tis seated in a wide Plain, having about it green hills, delight∣full Meadows, navigable Rivers and Lakes, which furnish them with delicate Fish. In summ, this Country affords in most plentifull mea∣sure whatsoever can be desired. Tis so thronged with <HI>Artizans</HI> of all sorts, that the vulgar proverb goes.
<Q>Chi volesse rassettare Italia rovinarebbe Milano</Q></P>
<P>But the chief of them are Gold-Smiths, Armourers, Gun-makers, and Weavers, who here exceed in these particulars, and in works of Christal, either <HI>Venice</HI> or any other part of <HI>Italy;</HI> the Nunns work here likewise most exact and neat curiosities in straw works. It a∣bounds likewise with most magnificent and Stately Palaces, among which the stupendious Palace of <HI>Tomaso Marini</HI> (built with so vast ex∣pence and Artifice, that whoever beholds it stands amazed) shines like the Moon among the Starrs.</P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>Porta Zobbia,</HI> named among the chief of <HI>Europe,</HI> both for its site, greatness, beauty, and its plenty of Artiglery, Arms, and Ammunition, is so impregnable, that hitherto twas never taken by force, but through failer of provisions and Famine it hath been yeel∣ded up. This Fort may be compared to an indifferent City, for within it are streets, Piazzaes, Palaces, Shops for Gold-Smiths, and all other Trades whatsoever, together with all sorts of Victuals and other provision in time of War, as well as Peace. Immense <HI>Bastions,</HI> with three large profound Dykes, environ it, through which run great Chanels of Water, with a most vast Wall, and spatious Ram∣parts, under which they walk by a close way made to that pur∣pose. Upon the Battlements and through the Porteholes up and down, are drawn out great Mouths of Cannon, and other pieces of Artiglery set upon Iron Carriages, some whereof shoot Bullets of 800. pound weight, with such force that no obstacle can withstand them; It hath one place to lay up, and dispose the Arms in a Ca∣pacious Arcenal, replenisht with infinite Arms of all sorts both for Offence and Defence. The Tower in the midst of it, is of a square form, and is in circuit (not reckoning the Towers which one may
<PB N="67" REF="45" MS="y"/>
call little Forts) 200. paces. The whole Castle or Fort is 1600. paces in circum ference, besides the Trenches. In fine tis accounted by all Ingineers the fairest and strongest fortification of <HI>Europe.</HI> They un∣willingly admit any Stranger to see the out-works, much less the in∣teriour parts.</P>
<P>It abounds with rare and excellent Pictures, among others there is one upon the Front of a Palace near the Fort, wherein are painted the Acts of the <HI>Romaus,</HI> by the hand of <HI>Trofo da Monza,</HI> so divinely, that tis impossible to add to it. The Images are done so exact to the life and so natural, that all the beholders rest astonisht, and expect speech from those inanimate (but seeming breathing, and moving) Pictures.</P>
<P>To say no more, Art here hath overcome Nature. Towards the Gate <HI>Beatrice,</HI> is the Front of another Palace (of the <HI>Lituadi</HI>) painted so rarely well by the hand of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that it almost fascinates the eyes of the <HI>Aspicients.</HI> And at the Gate <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>osa,</HI> stands an admirable Sta∣tue made to the middle, at the Publick cost, in remembrance of a Strumpet, who principally caused <HI>Milan</HI> to gain its Liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Milan</HI> from the death of <HI>Belloveso</HI> continued ever head of the adja∣cent Countrey, which made the antient Emperors to send thither a Lieutenant with title of Count of <HI>Italy,</HI> who also was Captain Gene∣ral of the Empire, and remained there with Consular authority, and Captain of their Armies, that he might bridle the Fury, and shut up the passage from the Inroads into <HI>Italy</HI> of the <HI>Ultramontaneous</HI> People.</P>
<P>Such is the wholsomness of the Ayr, the Beauty of the Country, and Copiousness of sustenance, that it hath tempted many Princes (desirous to rest quiet) to make this their Retreat, and <HI>Asylum,</HI> as al∣so many other great Men that they might the more commodiously apply themselves to the Study of Learning: Of which were <HI>Virgil, Alipius,</HI> Saint <HI>Augustine, Hermolao Barbaro, Merula, Francesco Filelfo, Celio Rodigino, Alexander</HI> the sixth, and <HI>Pious</HI> the fourth Popes. And although too often this City was thrown down to the very founda∣tions, and at last furrowed with the plough of the Enemies, yet it ever revived again, and that with more beauty and Splendor than at first, increasing still so much in Riches and People, that it ever kept a place among the chief Cities of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Church <HI>San Salavdore,</HI> there stood a proud Palace of the Emperors, with a Temple dedicated to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> made in emulation of the <HI>Campidoglio</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and where now the Counsel is kept, was the Palace for Justice; where also the Proclamations of the Dukes were accustomed to be publickly read, and the due punishments ex∣ecuted on Malefactors. There was also a Theatre to present Come∣dies, a place for Horse▪ races, and a large Circle where now is <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore.</HI> The Garden near <HI>San Steffano,</HI> was an Amphithea∣tre, where they accustomed to fight Duels. The Church of <HI>San Na∣zario</HI> was an old Prison, where they condemned Malefactors to fight with the wild Beasts there preserved to that end in great number,</P>
<P>The Common Field was then a Theatre, where the young men exercised themselves in taming and manning of Horses, and fighting. Where the Cathedral Church is, was a place with Stalls many waies where they made their Feasts to their Heroes and Houshold Gods. The

Stalls now for the Cattel, then was a pleasant Garden, beautified and planted with many Fruit trees and plants brought from far Countries; great store of odoriferous flowers; Rivolets of Christal∣line waters, Statues and Sculptures of Marble. Where the Church of <HI>San Lorenzo</HI> stands now, were the hot Baths of <HI>Maximinian, Nero,</HI> and <HI>Nerva,</HI> the Emperors, nothing inferiour to them at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Besides which antiquities, there yet is preserved a stately Armo∣ry in the Palace, replenished with most noble Arms, worthy any Prince for the value and fairness, being not onely inlayed with Gold and Silver, but engraven with greatest Cost and Workmanship; where now is the Church <HI>San Lorenzo,</HI> was a Temple dedicated to <HI>Hercules,</HI> made in the form of the <HI>Rotunda</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> near which were erected 16.

<P>This City <HI>Pavia,</HI> as well in the forenamed Battel in 1525. as in several others before and since in latter times, when the <HI>French</HI> un∣dertook invasions into Italy and beseiged it, hath fatally proved the overthrow of their Armies, the loss of their designs, and the Ruine of their Interest in that Country.</P>
<P>In this City was instituted a famous University, not much inferi∣our

to that of <HI>Paris,</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, whose zeal to amplifie the Christian Religion, caused him to send thither learn∣ed <HI>Theologians,</HI> to teach publiquely the true Doctrine, as also other eminent Doctors well read in all the Sciences, who were much en∣couraged to repair thither by their large Stipends and his signal fa∣vours; <HI>Giacone</HI> the so much celebrated Doctor, among others, spent many years in this Academy, also <HI>Baldo,</HI> having here read for some time, dyed, and lies interred in the Convent of the Fryers <HI>Francis∣cans,</HI> and tis conceived that the sereneness of the Ayr, so much sharp∣ens the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Students, that it hath thence acquired the name of a glorious University.</P>

<P>THis City is more memorable for its antiquity than fair building being first built by the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> who being perplexed and molested by the <HI>Ombrians,</HI> and <HI>Sabines,</HI> voluntarily gave it them up▪ and returned into <HI>Greece,</HI> but the <HI>Ombrians</HI> were thence driven by the <HI>French,</HI> and they by the <HI>Romans,</HI> under whom it remained till they with the <HI>Heruli</HI> took the Country <HI>Odouacre,</HI> but then they were driven out by the <HI>Ostrogoths,</HI> under <HI>Theodorick</HI> their King who made it his Regal Seat, under whom it remained 70. yeers, and then they were beaten out by <HI>Narsete,</HI> Praefect of <HI>Justinian</HI> the Emperor, under the Title of <HI>Exarchi,</HI> after whom 17. more <HI>Exarchi</HI> governed it 170. yeers, who were all that time held in continual skirmishes with the <HI>Longobardi,</HI> who were called into <HI>Italy</HI> by <HI>Narsete,</HI> against the said Emperour of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> For <HI>Narsete</HI> being accused to <HI>Giustino,</HI> Successor to <HI>Justinian,</HI> for some crime, whereat <HI>Giustino</HI> was offended which backed with the instigation of the Emperours wife, caused the Emperour to send another to be <HI>Exarche</HI> in his Room, who being exasperated against the Emperour for it, invited in the

This <HI>Exarche</HI> was in the nature of a King, having ple∣nary Jurisdiction in all things without appeal: <HI>Astolfo</HI> some time af∣ter being overcome by <HI>Pipino</HI> King of the <HI>French,</HI> gave up <HI>Ravenna</HI> to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but <HI>Desiderius</HI> successor to <HI>Astolfo,</HI> not regarding his Faith after the retreat of <HI>Pipin</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> Army, possessed himself again of <HI>Ravenna</HI> and other Towns, but the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great returning into <HI>Italy</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> Army, overcame and took him Prisoner, when the <HI>Longobardi</HI> were forced to quit <HI>Italy</HI> altogether, so that it hath suffered many disgraces, and was after∣wards sacked by the <HI>French,</HI> and destroyed by civil discord.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> saies that in his time <HI>Ravenna</HI> stood upon certain Piles dri∣ven into the <HI>Fennes,</HI> and that the water passed under it, so that no coming was to it but by Bridges or Boats, and when the waters were high, then the people were forced to get up into the upper Rooms, yet for all that twas healthfull, as <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>AEgypt,</HI> but now the Waters are so dryed up that the <HI>Fenns</HI> are become Excellent Mea∣dows, Pastures, and Corn Grouuds, many Historians agree that twas much beautified by <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> accommodating it with a great Bridge, and erecting the high Tower called <HI>Faro,</HI> where he en∣camped an Army for defence of the Gulfs and lodged the Souldiers in the midst of the City, in a form like a Castle, which afterwards was called the <HI>Fortezza</HI> of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> it had another Fort called <HI>Cesarea,</HI> with Walls and Bastions, which strongly fortifyed the Port of <HI>Ra∣venna,</HI> but at present neither the Ports nor Forts appear, only some certain old Churches and Monasteries of little moment.

<P>The biggest Church of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> is the Arch-Bishops, upon whose high Altar was formerly sustained a massy Silver heaven or canopy on four Pillars, which was worth 30000.

King of <HI>France,</HI> when with∣out any difference he sacked this City, for which they afterwards re∣ceived from the most high condigne punishment, being most of them cut in pieces, or forced to leap into the <HI>Poe,</HI> or <HI>Tesino,</HI> where they drowned themselves. In a Semicircular Chapel, are Limned those first Arch-Bishops of <HI>Ravenna</HI> (elected by the shewing of a Dove) in Mosaick work, a fair piece, whose election was after this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Sant Apollinare</HI> (believed one of the 72 Disciples of Christ, then ascended into Heaven,) departing from <HI>Antiochia,</HI> with Saint <HI>Peter</HI> togo to <HI>Rome,</HI> had in his passage taught the Christian Faith at <HI>Ravenna,</HI> and afterwards stayed there to govern it, whom none of the Disciples by him left judged themselves sit to succeed to govern that Church where fore all of them together withdrew themselves into a Temple to pray to God to demonstrate to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>h of them it would please his Divine Majesty to commit that care, whereat the holy Spirit in the form of a Dove descended upon the head of one, who was understood by it to be elected by God to that Dignity, after which manner eleaven Arch-Bishops were successively chosen. And the Casement, whereat the Dove entred is yet apparent though half shut, over the Arch of the high Altar in the Church of <HI>Spirito Santo</HI> in this City, in which Church on the left hand is a heap of Bricks, near which in a Cor∣ner stood <HI>Severus</HI> a mean person and a simple Man, upon whose head the holy Spirit descended visible to all, he being the last of the eleaven.</P>
<P>Tis worth ones pains to view the Church of Saint <HI>Apollinare,</HI> called the golden heaven, built most sumptuously by <HI>Theodorick,</HI> King of the <HI>Ostrogoths,</HI> it hath two ranks of most noble great Columns, brought hither by that King from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and is garnished with many pretious Marbles, extracted from <HI>Rome,</HI> and other places of <HI>Italy,</HI> and also some other Churches.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ravenna</HI> are many antiquities, Epitaphs, and antient Memori∣als, whose Letters and words require a University of Interpreters. The ruines of a stately Palace (supposed King <HI>Theoricks</HI>) appear yet in the midst of its Fountain is a statue of <HI>Hercules Horarius,</HI> not else∣where found. <HI>Hercules</HI> stands like an <HI>Atlas,</HI> bending with his left knee as ready to rise, who with his two hands elevated and his head
<PB N="117" REF="70"/>
together supports a Solar <HI>Horologe,</HI> whereon the shadow of the needle from the Sun shewes the houre of the day. A like statue of <HI>Hercules</HI> was found in <HI>Rome</HI> in the Vineyard of <HI>Steffano del Buffalo,</HI> which in∣stead of the <HI>Horologe</HI> supported a round Globe with the Celestial Signs, distinctly figured, but this difference is not of any great mo∣ment, nearly weighing the Signification of the thing for the know∣lege of the hour arose from the observation of the Celestial motion, and tis the Sun distinguishes the hour, who by his annual course vi∣sites the whole Cirk of the Firmament, which hath caused some to conjecture, that <HI>Hercules</HI> signifies the Sun, and that the 12 labours counted as of a Mans, is the Ingress of the Sun through the twelve Signs in the circuit of the skies, whereby the Sun of it selfcasts forth its beams, persuing which Opinion, misteriously though with some∣what accult sense they apply to the sun all the other Fables of <HI>Her∣cules,</HI> which are two tedious here to be applyed, let it suffice to have spoken so much to the purpose, of that statue, to rouse up our youth into a more near Scrutiny of the sense of the Fables of the antients, from the knowledge wherein may be extracted many natural secrets, hid under those their sayings and Fables.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Ravenna</HI> stands a most antient round Church of the blessed Virgin, being so fair and large, that the inward circle is 25. foot in diametre: The walls are finely wrought, and all the pavement is layed with small stones of various colours, disposed into divers plea∣sing figures after the Mosaick work, the Roofis of one squared en∣tire hard stone hollowed, in the midst whereof is the <HI>Cupola,</HI> where∣by the light penetrates, tis scarce imaginable how or by what Art so great a stone could be mounted so high, nor where had the Edge or Plate on the Walls at top as near as can be guessed are about 35 foot in circuit, above the said Edge on the top four fair Collumns in for∣mer times susteyned the noble Sepulchre of <HI>Theodorick</HI> King of the <HI>Ostrogothes,</HI> of Porphire, specled with white, being one entire stone eight foot long, and four foot high, with a cover of Brass figured and wrought to admiration with gold and othergarnishments, which Tombe tis supposed <HI>Amalesunta</HI> his Daughter erected, but in the time of the <HI>French</HI> war, the wicked Souldiers of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12th. King of <HI>France,</HI> with hopes of some great booty within, drew it down and broke it, whereof some Reliques yet remain.</P>
<P>Three miles forth the City in the way to <HI>Forli,</HI> runs the River <HI>Ronco,</HI> on the Bank whereof stands a Cross of stone, in testimony that in the year 1512. <HI>Gastone de Fois</HI> Captain of the <HI>French</HI> Army, there obtained a victory with the loss of his own life, for that being too fiercly bent against his enemies. he advanced two forward with very few in full speed of his Horse, and of a sudden was dead, in which battail dyed that day eighteen thousand Souldiers, between <HI>French, Spaniards, Italians, Germans</HI> and <HI>Switzers.</HI></P>

Twas called <HI>Rimini</HI> from the River <HI>Rimini</HI> which washes it. The <HI>Picenti</HI> first justly held it, but they were over∣come by <HI>Appius Claudius</HI> who triumphed for it, and dilated the Em∣pire from <HI>Esino,</HI> or <HI>Fiumef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>no</HI> to the River <HI>Pissatello.</HI> Tis seated in a most fertile Plain, having on the East and West parts of it excellent plow-Lands, on the South great plenty of Gardens, Orchards, Olive∣Woods, and Vineyards upon the hills of the <HI>Apenine</HI> Mountains, and on the North the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, all which as twere in emulation strive which shall exceed the other in affording of necessaries and de∣licacies of all sorts to its Inhabitants.</P>

<P>At the <HI>Porta Orientale,</HI> leading to <HI>Pesaro,</HI> is a fair Marble Arch, e∣rected there in honour of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> when having been seaven times Consul, he was elected for the eighth, he having fortified and adorned (by commission of the Senate, and Will of the People of <HI>Rome</HI>) the five chief Roads of <HI>Italy,</HI> as may be guessed, from those few legible fragments of carved Letters yet remaining, whereby it appears that the <HI>Via Flaminia,</HI> was of great consideration, <HI>Augustus</HI> having assumed to himself the care of accommodating that Road from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Rimini</HI> (as <HI>Suetonicus</HI> recounts) and given the charge of accommodating the rest to certain illustrious Men, with order to dis∣pose what ever spoiles they took from the Enemies, to that purpose. For a memorial of which publique benefit, are yetextant certain mo∣neys or medals of Gold then stamped with the Effigies of <HI>Augustus,</HI> with his titles on the one side, and on the other an Arch with two Doors elevated over a Way, on the top whereof sits Victory driving a triumphal Chariot, with these words, <HI>Quod viae munit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> sint,</HI> which words declare the occasion of that great honour done to <HI>Caesar</HI> was for his care and cost in amending the high Waies &amp; publick Roads.

<P>FIfteen miles being passed you finde placed upon a hill the famous Church of the Virgin <HI>Maria de Loreto,</HI> visited from all parts of the World by <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> either through penance enjoyned thereto, or their own vows or devotion, Tis called <HI>Loreto,</HI> for that in antient timestood near it a Wood of Laurels. Some will have, that in the same place <HI>viz</HI> the Moūt, stood the Castle <HI>Cupra</HI> of the <HI>Tuscans</HI> with the antique Temple of <HI>Juno Caprana</HI> now tis a Town but yet envroned with Walls, Ditches, Fortresses, and Arms in readiness, to defend it self from the violence and snares of the <HI>Corsari,</HI> banisht Persons, Robers and other wick∣ed Men, whereby the Inhabitants live securely and are well provi∣in all things for the receit of strangers. 'Tis a most stately Church, built with squared Stones of excellent Marble of great cost, in the midst whereof the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> visite that most holy Chamber of the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary</HI> with a great devotion, which is compassed in with a sur∣rounding square of Marbles engraven and wrought with figures of admirable artifice, but so placed that it toucheth not the Walls there∣of in any part, and tis credibly held, that those Walls within which the Queen of Heaven was born and brought up, ought not to be more wrought or adorned by human industry. This Chamber was brought hither from <HI>Palestina</HI> by <HI>Angells,</HI> and he is pronounced an Infidel that doubts thereof. having so many grave Authors and dayly Mi∣racles to prove it.</P>
<P>The great quantity of Tablets, Offerings, and Presents, hung up∣on the Walls, Pillars, and Cornishes of the Church, at the first en∣trance will raise a certain proness to honour the place in the most ob∣durat heart. There it clearly appears how great and inspeakable signs the most great God shewes of his Power for the Salvation of human kind, by granting all the prayers of such as with a devout and sincere heart seek him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The infinite Miracles wrought there, shew that God will be sought in one place more than another, in the Church hang many pourtraies of human misery (as in a theatre) which notwithstanding our merci∣full God conduceth to a good end, as particularly by divers acci∣dents by Water, evil Times, Shipwracks, Thunderbolts Earthquakes

<P>With which afflictions God is pleased to exercise his Children, to expresse his Clemency more than his Justice, that by it we may more truly prepare our hearts and our Souls worthy for his habitation, and for our eternal bliss.</P>

<HEAD>The Nobleness and Magnificence of the Church of LORETO, compendiously drawn out of the five Books of <HI>Floratio Torsellino</HI> a Jesuist.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough no day passeth wherein the Cel of the holy Virgin is not visited by many strangers, as well <HI>Poles, Spaniards, Germans, Portugals,</HI> &amp; other <HI>Oltramontaneous</HI> and <HI>Oltramarine</HI> Nations as <HI>Italians</HI>) yet there are two seasons in the yeer, when there is exceeding concourse to wit, Spring and Autumn. In the Spring begins the solemnity, the day of the Conception of our Lord, and in Autumn the day of the birth of our Lady, and each solemnity continues for 3. Moneths, wherein each day the house of <HI>Loreto</HI> is repaired to by great multi∣tudes of people, the greater part whereof go in companies with their Ensignes, having carryed before them a Crucifix with the Images of Saints. Every Company hath its own governors &amp; Priests who sing, &amp; the <HI>Donatives</HI> offered follow, which are of more or lesse valew ac∣cording to the quality of the Persons and their Devotions, which method of going &amp; singing praiers &amp; praises to God, excites great piety in the Pilgrims, and people who follow (though not in order) in infi∣nite multitudes. When at a distance the Companies begin to see the Church (which is seated on a hill above the Fields) they inter∣nally are moved to devotion, and cast themselves upon the ground weeping for joy, saluting the Mother of God, and then pursue their journey, some renting their garments and putting on sackcloth, others beating themselves, and being beaten by others with many stripes on the nakedshoulders. In the mean time the Priests of <HI>Loreto,</HI> go to meet these Companies, introducing them into the Church, with solemn musick, Trumpets, and Bells, when they approach the dore the Companies again fall flat on the ground saluting the Virgin from the bottome of their hearts, with such zeal, that the beholders are moved to tears.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="76"/>Arrived at the Chamber of the Virgin, which shines most clear by the many lights brought in their hands, they contemplate the Effi∣gies of the <HI>Madonna,</HI> with such Piety, Tears, Sighs, and humility, as is wonderfull, and many affix them selves so much to consider the place and Actions which the Mother of Christ there performed, that were they not driven out by other companies who overtake them, they would never remove thence, but such as come from far Coun∣treys, not being able to preserve the order of Companies, resort thither in the best manner they can, the most part if not all commu∣nicate there, and leave their offerings at the Altar, but the most pre∣cious offerings are consigned to the deputies, whose charge is to set them and the givers names down in a Book, for perpetual remem∣brance. The Altar erected by the Apostles, and the effigies of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> are alwaies clothed from time to time with sumptuous garments, aud ornaments of great valew both in Gold and Jemms.</P>
<P>The Church is alwaies full with wax lights and Lamps burning, resounding with musick and Organs, but what more imports tis filled with the Spirit of God, which terrifies the bad, rejoices the good, heals the infirm, and works stupendious miracles. The number of the Pilgrims at <HI>Easter</HI> useth to be 12000. and at the <HI>Penticost</HI> and nativity of the Virgin not much inferiour if not more, there hath been the day of the said Nativity in our times, and the day following above two hundred thousand Persons which hath necessitated the intendents, to make a rail round about the Cel whereby to exclude and admit whom they think fit, that they may not be opprest by Multitude. Moreover because in all times the Companies of Souldiers inten∣ding for the Wars resort thither first to confess and communicate, the Road is so well accommodated with Inns and houses of Reception, that any Person though delicate and weak, may make the journey on foot, besides that the continual concourse of fresh companies to and fro, renders the way less heavy; this convenience invited <HI>M. Antonio Colonna</HI> (not to speak of others) a famous, rich, and great Commander, to take that Journey on foot. These Companies ha∣ving seen the countenance of the Virgin, rejoyce spiritually, and com∣monly acknowlege they have gathered great benefit from the Pilgri∣mage though difficult. Were it not too long &amp; difficult twere worth ones pains to recount the vowes there made, and rendred to God, how many there escape out of the mire of Sin, how many are there loosed from the intricate tyes of carnal and forbidden pleasures, how many there lay down their hatred and old envy, how many men al∣most desperate to do more good, and bound already to the Gates of hell by compact between them and the Divel, yet there deliver them∣selves from the Enemy, and recover a state of Salvation; finally, as the Soul is more pretious than the Body, so the Miracles of the bles∣sed Virgin of <HI>Loreto</HI> wrought for the Soul, are more than those that are for the Body, so that to discourse more at large the things tou∣ched here, were a desire to measure and confine the divine power by humane frailty. Which to avoid, tis better to let it alone, than un∣dertaking it to rest unsatisfied, and although for the most part Fame surpasseth the thing spoken of; yet whoever hath seen <HI>Loreto,</HI> must confess Fame could not speak so much of it and its glory as he there saw and contemplated.</P>

<P>THis City glories, in the universal agreement of all Authors, that tis one of the most antient of <HI>Italy,</HI> and they that speak of its latest Original attribute it to <HI>Lucchio Lucnmone Laerte</HI> of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> who reigned 46. yeers after the foundation of <HI>Rome.</HI> from whom some say it took its name <HI>Lucca,</HI> but some others aver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> twas built long be∣fore that time, even by the <HI>Grecians</HI> before the destruction of <HI>Troy.</HI> It alwaies was for its strength and power of much consideration: and that made <HI>C. Cempronius</HI> after the overthrow he received from <HI>Hannibal</HI> at <HI>Trebbia,</HI> and the lesse fortunate day fought before <HI>Piacenza</HI> to recover <HI>Lucca,</HI> with the remnant of his Army as to a place that yeelded asecure retreat; and the valorous <HI>Narsete,</HI> who for the Em∣perour <HI>Iustinian,</HI> freed <HI>Italy</HI> of the <HI>Goths,</HI> could not have gained it with his 7 Moneths tedious and most rigorous siege, had he not by a certain wile and cunning perswaded or rather intreated the Citizens to deliver their City of their own accord and with their own terms. Its Seignors or Lords have so well added to its former strength, that no City in <HI>Italy</HI> comes near it, for it hath eleaven strong Bulworks in lesse than 3. miles circuit, and a vast wall, with works within, upon which the Trees planted, the pleasant and fertile hills surroun∣ding it, and the stately Palaces in the heart of it renders it a most de∣lightfull City.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> reports the <HI>Romans</HI> often raised there many foot Souldiers and some Horse, and <HI>Gasper Sardo</HI> writes that at the Naval fight be∣the Christians and <HI>Sarazens</HI> in <HI>anuo</HI> 1179. <HI>Lucca</HI> had seaven Galleys, un∣der the command of <HI>Nino delli Obezi</HI> its Citizen, a valiant Captain, who was also Lieutenant of those of the Church in the same Fleet, when they obtained immortal fame in that Victory, and in 1303. the <HI>Lucchesi</HI> colleagued with the <HI>Florentines</HI> against the <HI>Pistoiesi,</HI> and of the 16000. foot and 1600. Horse, then in the Army, the <HI>Lucchesi</HI> had 10000. Foot, and 600. Horse.</P>
<P>This City was beloved, and held in great esteem by the <HI>Romans</HI> conceding to it, the fo much coveted privilege of a municipal Ci∣ty, and making it a Colony.</P>
<P>We read in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rticular, that (at the needfull repairing of <HI>Rome</HI>) <HI>C.

<P>In the time that <HI>Tuscany</HI> with the rest of <HI>Italy</HI> divided into 12 Governments was under the <HI>Longobardi, Lucca</HI> was the appointed, residence for the Regent of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> where (as such) <HI>Desideri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> resided, when in <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>no</HI> 577. he was created King of the <HI>Longobardi.</HI> Afterwards twas governed by Marqueses, who also resided there as in the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Province, where the <HI>Marchese Adalberto</HI> dwelt with infinite Splendour, and so nobly in <HI>anno</HI> 902. received there <HI>Lewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> the Emperour, that he admiring the Kingly magnificence and grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nesse wherein the <HI>Marchese</HI> lived, said to one of his Intimats, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ruly (abstracting from the Title) he saw not wherein the

<HI>Marquess</HI> was inferiour to him. Among the, Marqueses of <HI>Tuscany, Bonilf da Lucca</HI> for his great Riches, his own valour and merits, was so much renowned, that he obtained for his wife, <HI>Beatrice</HI> Daughter of <HI>Corradns</HI> the second, and Sister of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, whose Is∣sue <HI>La Contessa Matilda,</HI> in a short course of time, remained Heiress and Lady of this and many other Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> and at her death be∣queathed the City <HI>Ferrara</HI> and that state which is called the Patrimo∣ny of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, by her last Will and Testa∣ment, which is yet preserved in <HI>Lucca.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards <HI>Lucca</HI> began to relish the beloved fruits of its antient Liberty, and in the yeer 1288. obtained a confirmation of it from the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> in which times being chiefly ruled by the <HI>Guelfan</HI> Faction, it was a long time preserved in good amity, and confederate with the <HI>Florentine Republique.</HI> Wherefore in <HI>Anno</HI> 1304. when the <HI>Florentine</HI> Republique was much perplexed by the Facti∣ons <HI>Bianchi,</HI> and <HI>Neri,</HI> the <HI>Lucchesi</HI> were requested by the <HI>Florentines</HI> to aid them, in repressing their tumultuous and confused Government, and when absolute power was given to the <HI>Lucchesi</HI> over all <HI>Florence,</HI> from <HI>Lucca</HI> were sent some of the most prudent Citizens, accompa∣nied with 9000. Souldiers, the most part horse: Who being suddain∣ly arrived, settled their guards up and down the City as they plea∣sed, and as if the City <HI>Florence</HI> had been absolutely under their Do minion: which done, they took in hand the government, and with the entire satisfaction of that Republique, in sixteen days, they qui∣eted the tumults and Factions, and established the form of the Go∣vernment for the future.</P>
<P>Some time after the which <HI>Lucca</HI> was governed by <HI>Ugoccione</HI> and by <HI>Castruccio</HI> its Citizen, an excellent Captain, who with his own sin∣gle valour kept the neighbouring Common-wealth in continual fear and suspicion, and finally after it had undergon for severall yeers through adverse fortune, the tyranny of divers Governours, its Usur∣pers; It reobtained for a certain sum of mony its former Liberty, from <HI>Charls</HI> the 4th. which (except from the yeer 1400. to 1430. when twas usurped by <HI>Paolo Gusinigi</HI> its Citizen) it hath ever since enjoyed most happily, and doth at present rejoice therein, and live in great tranquillity yet under the protection of the Catholick King, and with such security, that those Gentlemen to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>om the Gover∣ment of the Republique is committed, neither watch at, nor take care for any thing more than the publique good, and Union o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> all its Citizens, the two principal and necessary Foundations, for the maintenance of the Republique. Its administration and Govern∣ment is an <HI>Oligarchy.</HI></P>
<P>This Clty is replenisht with many good and Artfull Structures, and a great number of stately Churches; Among which Its Cathedral, de∣dicate to Saint <HI>Martin,</HI> retains the chief prerogative. This Church hath been much adorned and favoured by the Popes, and first by <HI>A∣lexande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> the second, who in the yeer of our Lord 1070. (as we read in <HI>Baronius</HI>) was pleased to take upon himself the pains to consecrate it, then <HI>Urban</HI> the sixth in anno 1382. there celebrated <HI>Mass</HI> the night of the Nativity of our Lord, and honoured the chief standard bea∣rer, with the reading the Epistle by his order. The Bishop and Canons are endowed with great Privileges: being allowed the use

of the Archiepiscopal Ornaments, that is a Cross and Pall: and the Canons are faculted to bear the Priests cope, and purple Sattin robes, and the Mitre of white Sattin, <HI>More Cardinalium,</HI> and the Bishop is so great, that the Canons acknowledge no other Superiour but the Apostolick Sea.</P>
<P>Among the many graces wherewith this Church is favoured by the most high God, some may especially be considered; first that <HI>Luc∣ca</HI> was the first City of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> that (as <HI>Fr. Leandro</HI> and others re∣count) received the light of the holy faith, which happened in the 44th. yeer of our Salvation, by the means of Saint <HI>Paulino Antiocheno,</HI> the Disciple of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> crowned a Martyr upon the hill <HI>S. Iulia∣no,</HI> by <HI>Anozino</HI> President in <HI>Pisa.</HI> Secondly, that in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, with most singular favour it obtained the holy Counte∣nance or Visage, (<HI>Volto Santo</HI>) formed and placed miraculously by a divine hand, on the venerable Statue of the Saviour of the World: framed by <HI>Nichodemus</HI> his Disciple, when he stood as 'twere bereaved of senses, with consulting to form the head with such perfection as might give honour to the Statue.</P>
<P>In it lie the bodies of <HI>S. Paolino, Rigolo</HI> and <HI>Frediano.</HI> Its principal Pro∣tectors, with those of 33. other Saints, whereof 14. were <HI>Lucchesi.</HI> In the yeer 1588. was found here a Miraculous Image of our Lady, through whose mediation God hath here done wonderfull graces to the faithfull of divers Nations. It hath afforded Popes, Cardinals, Lords, and famous Captains in great numbers with exquisite Sho∣lars: whereof one must be mentioned, to wit Fryer <HI>Panigni,</HI> having so great a renown through all parts of the world for his elaborate and exact Translation of the holy Scripture out of the Hebrew into the Latin Tongue, whom we will set alone though many others in seve∣ral Sciences, Qualities, and Honours might be well remembred with him. Many noble Families quitted this their Countrey, either to avoid the plagues, or tyrannies of Usurpers, and retreated to <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoua,</HI> where some of them are in that honour as to be admitted Partners in the government of those States as if originally of those Republiques.</P>
<P>The Territories of <HI>Lucca</HI> are small, but through the Industry of the Inhabitants, most fertile and abounding in all things, and so well peopled, that they have eighteen thousand Men enrolled in the Mi∣litia, besides those of the City: In them lies those so health, affor∣ding Bathes, celebrated by many Historians and other writers, whi∣ther annually resort from all parts infinite infirm and Lame Persons, who for the most part return comforted and recovered: In the way whereunto they pass two Bridges over the River <HI>Serchio,</HI> whose Ar∣ches are so large that they are wonderfull to the beholders: And tis certain all <HI>Europe</HI> cannot shew two Bridges so noble and fair.</P>
<P>Many other remarkable things might be inserted of this most no∣ble City and its State, but to avoid prolixity, and pursue the stile be∣gun, the more curious are referred to the particular writers who treat thereof most copiously.</P>

<P>THis City is head of the Province <HI>Liguria,</HI> situate on the Sea shore at the foot of very high Mountains which though slerile by na∣ture by the Inhabitants industry are become most fertile and pro∣duce most necessaries besides those delights which ly on the South part of it. Its ayr is good, though somewhat enclineing to hot and dry tis built in part upon hills and in part upon a Plain or Level. On the Maritine part Westward, It hath a Port may well merit the name of the most importent of <HI>Italy.</HI> It enjoyes the Treasure of Liberty, and is governed in form of a Republique, all its state being content with that form, knowing that to the obedient Life Honour and Goods, under that government are in no hazard. It stands be∣tween two Rivers the one on the East 70. miles long, the other on the West a 100. In the River on the <HI>Levant</HI> about 6. miles from the City is the comely Town of <HI>Mervi,</HI> which plentifully stores it with Fruits and Flowers all the Winter. Tis Mistress and sole Governess of the Island of <HI>Corsica,</HI> whence in time of need they can advance a good quantity of Souldiers not inferiour in Arms or Valour to any other Nation. The People of <HI>Corsia</HI> most willingly yeelding them Obe∣dience, for their protection, and that costs them but a quarter of a Crown annually for each fire, and some other incensible tax. Every two yeers the Republique sends thither a Governour and the other Lawgivers and Judges, who haviug finished their Offices, are arraign∣ed by two Gentlemen impowred thither to that effect, who without any trouble to the subject, do them justice against any Governour or Judge at their own doors, who hath done them wrong: Which rule they also observe through all other parts of their state. On all part of the City are infinite pleasant Gardens and Pallaces beautified with all that Art can add to them or Riches procure their Structures being <HI>alla Moderna</HI> though somewhat high in most parts by reason that the City is but small, so that they are necessitated to make the best use of their Room which renders the streets in most places narrow and in some a little obscure. Though one street may be well termed the Mistress of the World called <HI>Strada Nova,</HI> being spatious, long, even, and on each side embellished with most stately Marble Pallaces, the fairest whereof belongs to the Duke of <HI>Oria.</HI> It hath a most spatious Port in form of a Theatre compassed in with noble Structures, which though defended by a most magnificent Mole (judged the greatest in Christendome) yet is when the South and Southwest Winds blow very tempestuous. Opposite to it is a <HI>Pharos</HI> bearing a Lanthern (for light to ships in the night time) of an extraordinary bigness. <HI>Darsina</HI> is a haven to it also, which is a sure retreat for Galleys and shipping at all seasons: The Galleys being there layed up in their several clas∣sis. For publick Edifices it hath the Merchants Hall. The publick Granaries the Dukes Pallace with the Armory of 30000. Men. And their Churches which though (in respect of others of <HI>Italy</HI>) they have not so much Beauty, that once seen they yeeld a <HI>Gusto</HI> to a second view, yet for their polisht Marble and inward Ornaments, were they placed any where but in <HI>Italy</HI> might well merit a larger Account.

<P><HI>ROME</HI> the Glorious is replenisht with stupendious Stru∣ctures, as well publique, appertaining to the Popes, as pri∣vate, belonging to Cardinals and Princes, who at this time frequent that City. The Gardens behind the <HI>Vatican</HI> called <HI>Belvedere,</HI> from their beauty and pleasantness, are no less estimable: In which Pope <HI>Sistus quartus,</HI> erected a noble Palace without regard to his expence, soe it might be excellently carved, painted, guilt, and embellish't with rare figures, thereby to make it a Kingly Receptacle for enter∣tainment of such eminent Princes and Lords, as should repair to <HI>Rome:</HI> Before the Front of that Pallace where the Pope resides, is a most stately Porticue composed in the form of a Theater, raised some steps above the Earth, and garnished with many marble Sta∣tues: and on the western part is another Porticue which stands be∣tween the one and the other Palace, (<HI>Belveder</HI> being near the Popes Palace) and will be when finish't according to the design, a most stately Piece and of great value.</P>

The Antients thought the Ocean to be Prince of the Waters, and Father of all things, a Friend to <HI>Prometheus;</HI> And that by means of the humidity and li∣quidness of the Waters, all things seem to generate from Seeds with the assistance of the Heavens: therefore they believed that every thing received Life from Water, with the favourable friendship of the temperat <HI>Genius</HI> of the Caelestial Bodies. This figure hath the Body covered with a thin vail, whereby they would signifie, that the Sea shrouds the Heavens with Clouds of its own vapours, mea∣ning by the Sea, the whole generation of waters, and they denote the Earths being covered with plants by the Hairs beard and ordina∣ry skinns beingall figured by the leaves of divers tender Plants. It hath two horns placed upon the Forehead. First because the Sea provoked by the winds roars like a Bull; and secondly because the Sea is governed by the Moons motion, which they called <HI>Cornuta,</HI> thirdly, because the Sea is called Father of Fountains and Rivers, which they figured <HI>Cornuti</HI> or horned. In its right hand is put the Rudder of a Ship, in token that the Waters (by means of the Ships being guided by these Rudders) are furrowed as best likes the Pi∣lot, of which Comodity they feigned <HI>Prometheus</HI> to be the Inven∣tor, they have placed it upon a <HI>Maritine Monster,</HI> to demonstrate that the Sea is generator of many wonderfull Monsters: One of which to the purpose is seen in <HI>Rome</HI> in the Antique marble sphere of <HI>Atlas</HI> placed among the celestial signes, upon this very occasion: Tis said that <HI>Andromada</HI> contending for beauty with the Nymphs of the Sea, being overcome, was by them given to this Monster, which devoured her, out of whose body (slain on the shore of <HI>Perseus</HI> who would have saved that Virgin) there issued so much blood, that it dyed the Sea red, whence that Sea was afterwards called <HI>Citreo</HI> or the Red Sea, for all which the <HI>Citreo</HI> is not that gulfe, which is vulgarly called the red Sea, but is that part of the Ocean affianced to the Gulph, which washes <HI>Arabia</HI> on the South, but now to our re∣lation of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P><HI>ROME</HI> formerly the Empress of the World cannot be enough praised: Her power was so great, her Riches so immense, her subjects so innumerable, her Territories and Dominions so vast: That well might Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> (in his three wishes for intermixing that concerning her with so divine things) be pardonable, which three wishes were, To have seen our Saviour in the flesh, to have heard Saint <HI>Paul</HI> preach, and to have seen <HI>Rome</HI> in her Glory: which had so spread her self over the whole Earth that a perfect <HI>Idea</HI> of her cannot be comprehended, and must needs have been the happiest sight that mortal eye could attain to. But when considered what she was, and how since devoured by fire by the insatiable <HI>Nero,</HI> and how pillaged sacked and thousands of mischiefs done her by the Barba∣rous, at the decay of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; One may well wonder how the new <HI>Rome,</HI> should be even emulous to exceed the Old: Being at this day the Queen of Cities, the Flower of <HI>Italy,</HI> and as one may say an Epitome of the whole Earth.

<P>FOR Beauty, sumptuousness, Artifice, and Worth; not only <HI>Rome</HI> but the whole world yeelds this meritoriously a preceden∣cy to all other Churches, especially in that part built in later times, to which <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. added a noble <HI>Cupolo,</HI> wherein are figured the Celestial <HI>Hier∣archy</HI> in pieces of Mosaick, that the beholders be∣lieve them painted. And <HI>Gregory</HI> the 13th. as glorious a Chappel in honour of Saint <HI>Gregorie Nazianzene,</HI> wherein he was buried. With∣out doubt it is the most perfect model of decent Magnificence in the World, there being an answerable uniformity within and without. And may justly be compared (if not said to surpass) the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> formerly accounted one of the seaven wonders of the world: burnt by <HI>Herostratus</HI> who by that horrid Act sought rather to perpetuate his name than to ly unremembred in his Grave. The Old Church had 24 collumnes of so various coloured Marble, as are not matchable, which were taken from the adjacent Sepulchre of <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour, who was most exquisite in all his works. Those other Pillars in the Chappel of the holy Sacrament and those that support the <HI>Volto Santo,</HI> that is the Towel of <HI>Veronica,</HI> with some others, were transported from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> into <HI>Italy</HI> by <HI>Titus Vespasia∣nus</HI> and taken out of the Temple and Palace of <HI>Solomon,</HI> after that the <HI>Iews</HI> were wholly overcome and their said City destroyed. The top is all of squares, <HI>Levati</HI> as they call it, like the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> in the Center of the Church stands the great Altar, all of solid Brass, in such stupendious pillars that each weighs 25000. pound and is of so incomparable workemanship that no Cathedral but St. <HI>Peters</HI> is fit to entertain it. Herein is the Sepulchre of the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the se∣cond, buried in <HI>anno</HI> 1486. in porphirie: A greater porphyre stone then this <HI>Italy</HI> affords nor, except that of <HI>Santa Maria Rotonda</HI> the Se∣pulture of <HI>Theodorick</HI> King of the <HI>Ostrogothes.</HI> This was one of the five Patriarchal Churches, and the old part was built by the Emperour <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, who caused it be sustained by Pillars: But Pope <HI>Iulius</HI> the second <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>anno</HI> 1507 was the Founder of the new part, himself laying the first stone of the foundation with his own hands in the presence of thirty five Cardinals, <HI>Bramante,</HI> of <HI>Urbin,</HI> was the Inventor of the Model, which <HI>Michael Angelo, Bonarota</HI> the <HI>Floren∣tine,</HI> afterwards added to and corrected.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio Fiorentino,</HI> by order of <HI>Eugenius</HI> the 4th. made the gate of Brass, with the figures of Christ, the blessed Virgine, of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>St Paul.</HI> In the holy week every yeer they shew here the Visage of Christ, called <HI>Volto Santo,</HI> impressed on the Towel of <HI>Veronica.</HI> There is one Figure of the Virgine <HI>Mary</HI> holding Christ dead in her lap the work of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> whose also is that most excellent
<PB N="160" REF="94"/>
Picture of universal Judgment, placed in the Popes Chappel. On the Eastern part of the Church hangs the Pinnace of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> in Mosaick work by <HI>Giotto Fiorentino.</HI> In the Chorus stands the Tombe of Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth, all of Brass, and on the top lies his Figure represented sleeping, with Vertue on both sides, and round it the Sciences, that is <HI>Theologie,</HI> Philosophy, and the liberal arts with his Inscription, The work of <HI>Antonius Palladius,</HI> in <HI>anno</HI> 1482. Herein also besides those of the first Martyrs <HI>Lyno, Cleto</HI> and o∣thers, are the graves and Tombs of many Popes to wit, of <HI>Innocent</HI> the 8th. in Brass. of <HI>Pius</HI> the 2d. a <HI>Siennois</HI> &amp; <HI>Pius</HI> the 3 Son of a Sister of <HI>Pius</HI> the 2 Of <HI>Marcellus</HI> the 2 who lived in the <HI>Pontificacy</HI> but 22. dayes. <HI>Iulius</HI> the third, all without Inscriptions. These following have all Epitaphs in verse: As <HI>Nicolas</HI> the 5th. <HI>Eugenius</HI> the 4th. <HI>Urban</HI> the 6th. <HI>Adrian</HI> the 1st. <HI>Gregory</HI> the 4th. and 5th. <HI>Boniface</HI> the 8th. <HI>Paul</HI> the 3d. whose Brass Tomb stands in the new part. <HI>Innocent</HI> the 4th. <HI>Urban</HI> the 7th. <HI>Gregory</HI> the 13th. and 14th. and also <HI>Balbo</HI> the most learned in the Greek, and Cardinal <HI>dalla Porta.</HI></P>
<P>Who desires more ample satisfaction in the particulars of the 7 principal Churches of <HI>Rome,</HI> shall find it in the diligent writings of <HI>Onofrius Panuinus,</HI> and <HI>Attilius Serranus,</HI> in the Latin tongue, and of <HI>Pompeio Ugonio</HI> in the Italian.

<HEAD>Of the Obelisks. Columnes and Aqueducts of <HI>ROME.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Obelisks restored erected and transferred by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. of glorious memory with incredible expence, by the workmanship of the Inginier <HI>Domenico Fontana,</HI> and consecrated to the most holy Cross are these.</P>
<P>The Obelisk of <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> standing now in the Piazza of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>Vaticano:</HI> in the second yeer of his inauguration, <HI>anno Dom.</HI> 1586.</P>
<P>That of <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> brought from <HI>AEgypt,</HI> and translated from <HI>San Rocco</HI> to <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore</HI> is not engraven nor carved at all.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="101"/>That which was consecrate to the Sun transferred from <HI>Circo Mas∣simo,</HI> (where it lay on the ground) to <HI>San Giovanni</HI> in <HI>Laterano,</HI> is car∣ved with <HI>AEgyptian</HI> characters, and was reared the third year of his Papacy; <HI>Augustus</HI> took it from its place in <HI>AEgypt</HI> &amp; conveyed it vpon the <HI>Nilo</HI> into <HI>Alexandria,</HI> where imbarquing it, he sent it by sea for a∣dornment of <HI>Rome,</HI> which he sought to imbellish in all things possi∣ble: which his endeavour and cost caused him once to vaunt, that he found <HI>Rome</HI> all of Brick, but left it of Marble</P>
<P>That dedicated to the Sun by <HI>Augustus</HI> in <HI>Circo Maximo,</HI> being drawn out of the Ruines among which twas buried, was translated with infinite expence to the <HI>porta Flaminia</HI> and raised before the Church <HI>S Maria del Popolo</HI></P>
<P>Besides the abovenamed, divers other Obelisks and Pyramides are yet extant in <HI>Rome,</HI> but all of small value, except that which was newly erected in the <HI>Piazza Novana</HI> by Innocent the X which is admirable▪</P>
<P>We gather from the writers of Antiquity that formerly there were many more Obelisks in <HI>Rome</HI> then at present appear. <HI>Pliny</HI> the time of <HI>Vespasian</HI> names many of them. <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> the contemporary with <HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperour sets down more, but <HI>P. Vi∣ctor</HI> commemorates to the number of 42. treating of the less. <HI>Andrea Fulvius, Pietrus, Angelus, Burgeus Pigafetta,</HI> and <HI>Michael Mercato,</HI> in the la∣tine and vulgar tongue give thereof most ample accounts.</P>
<P><HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> transmitted two Obelisks from <HI>AEgypt</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> at the time he overcame <HI>Marc Anthony</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and <HI>Publius Victor,</HI> re∣ckons seaven more conveighed thither afterwards. One whereof was placed in the Gardens of <HI>Salustius,</HI> which took up all the space and the vale from the Church <HI>Santa Susanna</HI> to the <HI>Porta Collina:</HI> This (they say) was consecrated to the Moon, and carved with <HI>Egyptian</HI> Characters, What vast Vessels were built for conveighing these <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Ammianus</HI> discourse at large, and one they say had 300 mariners in her. Now let us speak of those Obelisks that are marked with <HI>AEgyptian</HI> Characters: That of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Santa Maria maggiore</HI> being without such.</P>
<P>The Obelisk before Saint <HI>Giovanni Laterano,</HI> all over engraved with Hieroglyphicks was brought as asoresaid by <HI>Constantine</HI> the great out of <HI>AEgypt</HI> into <HI>Alexandria</HI> and erected in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and thence by <HI>Constantius</HI> his son in an immense Galley wherein were 300 Rowers at the Oar, to <HI>Rome</HI> and by him placed in the <HI>Circo Maximo:</HI> which <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. <HI>anno</HI> 1588 with incredible expence removed to Saint <HI>Giovanni Laterano</HI> where the Popes used formerly to inhabit. A second he removed from the <HI>Circo Massimo</HI> to <HI>Santa Maria Maggi∣ore</HI> formerly Consecrated to the Sun:</P>
<P>The third in the Vineyard of the great Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> filled with Hyerogliphicks: tis but small but tis thought stood in the <HI>Campo Martio,</HI> in the time of <HI>Tarquine</HI> the proud.</P>
<P>The fourth less than the former was transferred from the <HI>Campi∣doglio,</HI> by <HI>Ciriaco Mattei,</HI> and stands in the Vineyard of the <HI>Mattaei</HI> who had it of the gift of the Senat and people of <HI>Rome:</HI> this hath some small Images on the top only; the others all over.</P>
<P>There is another lying in the <HI>Via Appia,</HI> near the Sepulchre of <HI>Ce∣cilia Metella</HI> broke in 3 several pieces: which (tis much admired)
<PB N="176" REF="101"/>
that Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. did not erect as well as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>est: nor is it to be believed but that he would have done it, had not death inter∣rupted this and his other designes. One other smaller Obelisk stands near the Jesuits Colledge.</P>
<P>Tis admirable that upon all those Hierogls▪ &amp; Obelisks the sign of the Cross is figured: which might happen, either for that the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> through some mistery honoured the Cross, or for that they might have had some relation touching it from their Ancestors, and yet without knowing the signification. At the time when by the Emperour <HI>The∣odosius</HI> his command all the Idols of <HI>AEgypt</HI> were destroyed, On the Breast of <HI>Serapis</HI> was found the sign of the Cross, whereof the signification being enquired into, the Priests skilled in the sacred misteries of the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> declared, that they understood by it the Life to come after death here: which could not portend other, than the eternal beatitude whereto our Saviour by his death on the Cross opened the way. Thus <HI>Socrates</HI> the writer of the Ecclesiastick Histo∣ries in his 5th. Book 27th. Chap. recounts, as also do <HI>Russino, Georgio Cedreno,</HI> and <HI>Suida,</HI> in their writings. We must observe that the pu∣nishment by the Cross in those dayes common to Malefactors was ta∣ken away by <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour a true Christian, through his Reverence of our Saviours death: who in lieu thereof constituted the Gallows, as divers Authors relate: Which Emperour also pro∣hibited by a severe Law, the conculcating any Cross upon the Earth Let thus much serve touching the Obelisks of <HI>Rome,</HI> if the Reader be curious to search into those in <HI>Constantinople</HI> and other places (the discourse whereof is not to our purpose) let him peruse the treati∣ses of <HI>Michael Mercato, Pietro Bellonio,</HI> and <HI>Pietro Gillio,</HI> upon this subject.</P>
<P>In <HI>Rome</HI> also are 3 famous Collumnes: one Called <HI>Rostrata</HI> in the <HI>Cam∣pidoglio</HI> erected by C. <HI>Duilio,</HI> after the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were overcome in the <HI>Punick</HI> War. Another of <HI>Trajan,</HI> which <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fifth de∣dicated to St, <HI>Peter:</HI> and that of <HI>Anthony</HI> which the same Pope consecrated to Saint <HI>Paul</HI> in <HI>anno</HI> 1580.</P>

<P><HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. brought the <HI>Acqua Felice</HI> into the City, calling it <HI>Fe∣lice</HI> from his own name before he was advanced to the Pontifical Chair: Other Popes have likewise layed and restored other waters for the Citizens conveniency and delight.</P>

<HEAD>A Guide or Direction for the most con∣venient view of the Antiquities of <HI>ROME.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE will begin from the <HI>Vatican,</HI> chiefly in favour of those who come from <HI>Tuscany</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> entring by the <HI>Porta Vaticata,</HI> near the Castle Saint <HI>Angelo.</HI> Here ly the Meadowes and fields of <HI>Quinti∣us</HI> or as others say of <HI>Pincius</HI> at this day called <HI>Prata</HI> a lovely and pleasant place, whither the youth usually resort for Recrea∣tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Porta Elia,</HI> called vulgarly <HI>di Castello</HI> leads to <HI>Adrians</HI> Mole, A vast Pile which he raised for the burying place for himself and the <HI>Antonini,</HI> being large and strong, but at present better accomodated than in his time, for that the Popes have made it a Fortress for their own retreat and security, in time of imminent danger of Enemies, to which a long Gallery under Ground leads from the Palace of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> for their more convenient and safe passage. Heretofore One <HI>Cresentinus</HI> made himself Lord of it by force of Arms and of the Ci∣ty also: but at present the Popes possess it, and cal it <HI>Castel</HI> St. <HI>An∣gelo,</HI> from the Marble statue of an Angel with a sword in his hand sett on the top of it, which <HI>Alexander</HI> the 7th. augmented and fortified in ample manner as by the Inscription on the Bridge may be understood. In it are kept the three millions of Gold, which may not be imployed on any use but defence of the Apostolick state in point of Arms. The Marbles, Collumnes, and Statues formerly there, were conveighed to the <HI>Vatican,</HI> and placed in the Church of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and the Papal Palace, and nothing of Antiquity left behind but the structure, and two heads, the one of <HI>Adrian</HI> the Em∣perour armed, the other of <HI>Pallas,</HI> with some inscriptions on the walls, which notwithstanding, tis yet most worthy observation. Here stands the <HI>Ponte</HI> or Bridge <HI>Elio,</HI> so called for that <HI>Elius Adrianus</HI> the Emperour built it for his Sepulchre: but at present tis called <HI>Ponte di Castello,</HI> on either side of it stand the statues of the Apo∣stles Saint <HI>Peter</HI> and Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> wrought with excelling Workman∣ship under Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the 7th. at the time that the <HI>Tyber</HI> grown beyond its usual limits, overflowed to the great devastation of the City and this Bridge in <HI>anno</HI> 1530. Being upon this Bridge, you may see opposite to you the Hospital of <HI>Santo Spirito,</HI> and the Ruines of the triumphal Bridge, which was so denominated, for that over it were lead the Pompes of Triumphs as the way to the <HI>Campido∣glio.</HI></P>
<P>All that part of the <HI>Vatican</HI> hill between the Bridge and the Pa∣lace is now called <HI>Borgo,</HI> but was formerly named <HI>la selva</HI> because be∣fore the time of Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the second the <HI>Vatican</HI> Grove grew there, wherein was erected a Pyramide for the Sepulchre of <HI>Scipio Af∣fricanus,</HI> whereof some reliques may yet be seen in that part of the
<PB N="177" REF="102" MS="y"/>
Temple called <HI>Paradiso;</HI> as the great Pyne Apple, and Peacok of Brass guilt.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Borgo,</HI> almost all the Edifices are stately and noble, and in particular these following: The Palace of the Cardinal of <HI>Cesis</HI> at the gate of Saint <HI>Onofrio,</HI> whose first Court is full of Statues and in∣scriptions, the particulars whereof are printed and published: in it is an Effigies of the <HI>Amazon Hippolito</HI> infinitely applauded, being the workmanship of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> the Prince of Sculptors, another of <HI>Apollo,</HI> a third of a <HI>Sabyn</HI> Woman, no whit inferiour to that of the <HI>Amazon,</HI> had it Arms proportionable.</P>
<P>In the garden stands a statue of <HI>Bacchus</HI> upon a Pedistol: A Ves∣sel of Brass with a <HI>Faunus,</HI> a <HI>Neptune,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d an <HI>Apollo,</HI> holding a Harp in his hand: An Image of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Marcus Agrippa</HI> Another of <HI>Iulia</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> a Pallas armed, and <HI>Herma</HI> defloured. On the right hand appears a fountain with 22 Circles about it of Marble stone, on which stand the statues of <HI>A faunus, Iupiter Hammon, Pompey</HI> the Great, <HI>Demosthenes, Spensippus</HI> the Philosopher, who was thought to be the Son of a Sister of <HI>Pla∣to.</HI> In prospective from the Gate may be seen <HI>Rome</HI> triumphing for the overcoming of <HI>Dacia,</HI> sitting on a Throne with a Murrion on her head and a Branch of Laurel in her hand, with <HI>Dacia</HI> placed near it, in a mourning posture and Habit; round it are Trophees, as Arms of the Barbarous, two conquered Kings in <HI>Numidian</HI> Marble, bigger than ordinary men, two statues of two of the <HI>Parcae:</HI> and two <HI>Sphinxes</HI> of the same Marble.</P>
<P>Contiguous with it stands a round Fabrick called the <HI>Antiquario,</HI> from the many Antiquities contained in it: On the Front is fixed a Visage of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> in porphyr stone, and an effigies of <HI>Poppeia</HI> the wife of <HI>Otho</HI> the Emperour: above which stand five statues, That is of <HI>Pallas, Cercs, Victoria, Copia, and Diana.</HI> Within are seen the Statue of <HI>Somnus,</HI> or of <HI>Quies,</HI> or as others will have it of <HI>AEscu∣lapius</HI> with Poppy in his hands, and an Image of a <HI>Sabine</HI> Lady. In the gate on the left hand appears a Visage of <HI>Iove,</HI> as bigg as a Gy∣ants, on the right another of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and in the midst a third of <HI>Pallas.</HI> And under that of <HI>Hercules,</HI> a <HI>Satyre,</HI> who blows a Shepheards pipe of seaven Reeds: a neater piece of work then which is scarse to be seen, which is attributed to <HI>Scopa.</HI> Under that of <HI>Iove,</HI> a head of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> King of the Epirotes with a <HI>Leda</HI> and a <HI>Cupid.</HI> The <HI>Sa∣tyr,</HI> and the <HI>Leda</HI> are most compleat statues.

<P>Near the gate stand two statues, one on the left hand of <HI>Aries Fis∣sus</HI> of most white Marble, with these words on the Basis, <HI>Secura Sim∣plicitas.</HI> The other on the right hand of <HI>Leone,</HI> with these words up∣on the basis, <HI>Innoxia Fortitudo.</HI> Near which stands the Emperour, <HI>Heliogabulus,</HI> clothed at his full length, with certain antique Cere∣monies in the sacrifices engraven on the Basis: Upon another Image of an Emperour triumphing drawn by four horses, stands a <HI>Simia</HI> an Ape cut in <HI>AEthiopick</HI> Marble in the form the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> used to wor∣ship it.

<HEAD>The Popes Pallace.</HEAD>
<P>ON the Top of the <HI>Vatican</HI> Hill stands that proud Pallace of the Popes, which like a large City is capable of three Kings and all their followers: here the Popes (induced thereto from the beauty of the scite, and temperature of the Ayr) for the most part make their dwelling, having deserted their former on the <HI>Laterano.</HI> The first thing here to be viewed is the Chapel of <HI>Sixtus,</HI> which for its gran∣deur and beauty may be paralleld to any other great and noble Church: in it the Card i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>als assemble themselves for election of the Pope, and call themselves the Conclave, upon the high Altar whereof is that noble Picture representing the Universal Judgment, painted by <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> a Piece so generally a pplauded, that it's held in valuable, for its exellency, and unimitable by all succeding Artists, though divers and those the best attempt it dayly: Near it is the <HI>Capella Paolina,</HI> painted by the same hand: whence the way lies into the Gardens called <HI>Belvedere,</HI> The fair fight both for their infi∣nite beauty and the prospect of the most part of <HI>Rome,</HI> in it are many foreign rare plants. Herein stands the statue of the <HI>Tyber</HI> foxes con∣nexed with a wolf which gave suck to <HI>Remus</HI> and <HI>Romulus;</HI> The <HI>Nyle</HI> upon a <HI>Sphinx</HI> with 17. Children denoting the increases of that River with its effects upon <HI>AEgypt,</HI> with several monsters &amp; strong creatures proper only to that River: which statue was heretofore found near Saint <HI>Ste phens</HI> Church, and being thence conveighed into those gar∣dens, is there presented to publique view for that general approba∣tion of excellency which is meritoriously given it.</P>
<P>On the walls of the said <HI>Belvedere</HI> are moreover 12 several defor∣med Creatures set up, which are carved out of the politest Marble: And in certain Corners and Nooks stands a shape of <HI>Antinoo,</HI> cut in the whitest Marble of fingular Artifice and in this form by the com∣mand of <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour, who deputed divine sacerdotal ho∣nours with Temples, whose memory alsothat he might perpetuate, he built a City in <HI>AEgypt</HI> calling it from his name <HI>Antinopoli,</HI> On the right hand is the River <HI>Arno</HI> in the shape of a Man lying along, diffusing water from his Tomb, with <HI>Cleopatra</HI> on his left hand leaning on her

<P>In the fourth Armory in the <HI>Cants</HI> stands a statue of the Empe∣ror <HI>Commodus</HI> in the habit and shape of <HI>Hercules,</HI> holding a Child on his Arm, whose humour was to be so figured and called as histo∣rians report. In the fifth <HI>Apollo Pitheo,</HI> with a Serpent at his feet, and a <HI>Carcase</HI> having a piece of Cloth upon one Arm, a Bow and Arrows in his hand, and all over naked. In the sixth is <HI>Laocoon</HI> with his two Sons enveloped by two Dragons as <HI>Virgil</HI> writes the story, all of one Marble stone: This Piece was esteemed by <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> the Mira∣cle of Sculpture: and before his time by <HI>Pliny</HI> who saies that, twas wrought by <HI>Agesanero Poliodoro,</HI> and <HI>Athenodoro</HI> the principal Sculp∣tors of their times, and preserved in the Palace of <HI>Titus Vespasianus</HI> and found in his seaven Halls. Some space from which lies <HI>Cleopatra</HI> ready to give up the Ghost, of so exact workmanship and polite Mar∣ble, that underneath the Marble Garments which seem to lie over the whole body, the Limbs and shape of the person, do perfectly appear. In the same Palace and Gardens which are five, some in Terrace, others low, beside the aforenamed not a few nor mean Ves∣sels and statues present themselves as gratefull Objects to the Visi∣tants thereof: As to pass by others a Fountain made after a rustick manner, round which stand feigned Gods and Sea Monsters, very well represented: Together with the Images of Pope <HI>Paulus</HI> the 2 and the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the 5th. drawn by the hand of <HI>Michael An∣gelo,</HI> and a statue of one of the Curiatii, which is a fair one, and stands where the <HI>Switzers</HI> keep their Guard.</P>
<P>In the Armory, are Arms and all accomplishments for 35000. men horse and foot, and over the door of it is this Motto.

<P>In the <HI>Constantine</HI> Hall, to pass over the other things which are in∣finite, are painted several picturs drawn by the principal Painters in all Ages, chiefly the▪ Battel fought at the <HI>Ponte Milvio,</HI> and the victory obtained there by <HI>Constantine,</HI> against <HI>Maxentius,</HI> the work of <HI>Raphael Stantio</HI> of <HI>Urbin.</HI></P>

<P>THe Hill <HI>Ianiculus</HI> is now called <HI>Montorio quasi mons aureus,</HI> or the goulden Mount: near it lies the Circ of <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> where appear some fragments of the Sepulchre of <HI>Numa Pompilius,</HI> which yet demonstrate 'twas no great Fabrick: a certain assurance, that Ambition had not then in those times any great place in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Montorio</HI> is so called for the sparkling of the sand there; Where stands a Church of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and a round Fabrick wrought excel∣lently <HI>Dorick</HI> wise, the design of <HI>Bramante.</HI> At the high Altar of the said Church is a Marble stone whereon Christ was figured by <HI>Raphael</HI> of <HI>Urbin.</HI> On the right hand at the entrance into the Church Christ is rarely painted upon the Wall being whipt, by <HI>Bastiano the Venetian</HI> called <HI>del Piombo.</HI> Here stands the Tombe which <HI>Iulius</HI> the third cau∣sed to be built for himself then living, where for all that he had not the happiness to lye (dead) but was buried in a mean place in the <HI>Vatican.</HI></P>
<P>The Gate of Saint <HI>Pancratio,</HI> was formerly called <HI>Aureliana,</HI> or <HI>Settimiana,</HI> for that it was repaired by <HI>Septimius Severus,</HI> who near it erected an Altar and certain Baths: without this gate you see an A∣queduct not very high, through which ran the waters of the Lake <HI>Alsetino,</HI> into the Baths of <HI>Severus,</HI> of <HI>Filippus,</HI> and into the <HI>Nau∣machia,</HI> the place for Sea Fights of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>

<P><HI>San Nicolo</HI> in <HI>Carcere,</HI> formerly was the Prison for the common peo∣ple, but for that a Daughter expressed so much Piety to her Father there bound in chains as to nourish him many dayes with the milk from her own breasts, <HI>Attilia Gabrione,</HI> raised there a Temple dedica∣ting it to <HI>Piety.</HI></P>

<P>You may see the broken Bridge of <HI>Santa Maria Transteverina,</HI> or <HI>AEgittiaca,</HI> so named from the Neighbouring Church; which was for∣merly called <HI>Ponte Senatorio</HI> and <HI>Palatino,</HI> for that the Senators pas∣sed over that Bridge in religious manner to the <HI>Ianicolo,</HI> to consult the Books of the Sybills, and thence returned to the Court of the Emperours.</P>
<P>The House of <HI>Pilat</HI> placed near the <HI>Ponte Senatorio</HI> fabulously by the Vulgar, if we make a narrower inspection, and contemplate the most high ruine there appearing, must needs have been the <HI>Sudato∣ria Laconica,</HI> or hot Baths.

<P>The Church of <HI>Sancta Maria AEgittiaca,</HI> formerly the Tem∣ple of <HI>Fortuna Virilis,</HI> remains almost intire and unblemished having a long row of high Pillars on both sides.

<P>The Temple of <HI>Vesta</HI> built by <HI>Romulus</HI> between the <HI>Capitolinum</HI> and the <HI>Palatinum,</HI> stood where now is the Church <HI>dalle Gratie</HI> or <HI>dal∣le Consolatione,</HI> wherein the Vestal Virgins kept the holy and perpe∣tual Fire, and the <HI>Palladium,</HI> with the Domestick houshold Gods brought by <HI>AEneas, from Troy</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> but the said Temple being burning, the <HI>Palladium</HI> which was a wooden Image of <HI>Pallas</HI> with rol∣ling eyes was snatched out of the Fire and translated into <HI>Velia,</HI> where now is <HI>Santa Andrea</HI> in <HI>Palata.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Foro Boario,</HI> took its name either for that there they sold their Bulls, or because <HI>Evander</HI> having received the Bulls of <HI>Gerion</HI> consecrated that place for perpetual remembrance of that Victory, Adjacent to the Temple of Saint <HI>George,</HI> in <HI>Velabro</HI> stands a fair Arch all of Marble, beautified with excellent figures of Sacrifices, erect∣ed in former times by the Goldsmiths and Merchants in honour of the Emperors, <HI>Septimius Severus,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> And contiguous with this Arch stood the Temple of <HI>Janus Quadrifrons:</HI> four squared and in every front a large Gate, and 12. Nooks, wherein tis belie∣ved they set up twelve statues, representing 12 Months. The <HI>Romans</HI> sacrificed to <HI>Janus</HI> as Prince or President of the sacrifices, calling him also <HI>Vertumnus.</HI> Many Temples in <HI>Rome</HI> were dedicated to this God, among which that chiefly flourished which <HI>Numa</HI> built at the <HI>Porta Carmentale</HI> near the Theatre of <HI>Marcellus</HI> which had two Gates only, and they stood alwaies open in time of warr, and shut in times of Peace.

<P><HI>Il Velabro,</HI> where stands <HI>Santo Georgio</HI> in <HI>Velabro,</HI> was so denomi∣nated for this cause: When the <HI>Tyber</HI> overflowed and covered the face of the Earth, they could not pass into the <HI>Aventinum,</HI> from one bank to the other unless in Boats, for their passage wherein they payed a certain piece of money, which in Latin signifies a Booth, those boats being covered over.</P>

<P>The Great Altar erected by <HI>Hercules</HI> stood near the <HI>Schola Graeca,</HI> and by it <HI>AEmilius</HI> built the Temple of <HI>Pudicitia Patritia,</HI> wherein when <HI>Virginia</HI> entred, being herself noble but the Wife of a <HI>Plebeian,</HI> she was cast out by the other Matrons, whereat being offended she raised another Temple in <HI>Borgo Longo,</HI> to <HI>Pudicitia Plebeia,</HI> which cau∣sed a great <HI>Feud</HI> in the <HI>Patritian</HI> Matrons, but neither of the one nor the other does any footsteps now remain.</P>

<P>The Church of <HI>Santa Sabina,</HI> standing on the top of the <HI>Aventino</HI> antiently dedicated to <HI>Diana,</HI> was built by <HI>Ancus Martius,</HI> or as o∣thers say by <HI>Servius Tullius. Servius</HI> the sixth King of the <HI>Romans</HI> was Son of a Servant or slave, wherefore he commanded that there eve∣ry year on the 13th. of <HI>August</HI> a solemn Feast should be kept for the Slaves, on which day of their solemnity their Masters should not command them. Here <HI>Honorius</HI> the 4th. dwelt, and <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth erected there some stately Fabricks, to which <HI>Girolamo Bernerio</HI> cal∣led the Cardinal of <HI>Ascoli,</HI> added others with a Chappel. This Car∣dinal was of the Order of the preaching Fryers, and for that cause hath been a loving Patron to that Order.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Santa Maria dell'Aventino,</HI> was a Temple consecrated to <HI>Dea Bona,</HI> not far from which stood the House of <HI>Julius Caesar:</HI> whence <HI>Calphurnia,</HI> the wife of <HI>Caesar</HI> proceeded among the other Matrons to the said Temple to the Nocturnal duties performed to the said Goddess, when <HI>Clodius</HI> inamoured of her, habiting him∣self in the garment of a Woman, conveighed himself in amongst them, all men being prohibited admission to those duties: Who being no less ignorant of the place than of the Ceremonies, wandred too and fro in search of his Friend <HI>Calphurnia,</HI> and by that means was discovered by a certain Maid. Upon the <HI>Aventino, Hercules Victor</HI> had a Temple, which is now called the Church of <HI>Santi Alexii.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Hott Houses or Bathes which stood upon the <HI>AVENTINO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Hot houses or Bathes of <HI>Decius</HI> the Emperour called <HI>Deci∣ane,</HI> were near <HI>Santa prisca,</HI> formerly a Temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI> whereof as of the ensuing great ruines yet remain: Those called <HI>Variane</HI> stood near Saint <HI>Alexius.</HI> And those of <HI>Trajan,</HI> with his Pa∣lace on the farthest part of the <HI>Aventino</HI> in the Vineyard of <HI>Francisci Albertini,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Remoria,</HI> yet retains its antient name. 'Twas held an inau∣spicious place because in the bloud of <HI>Remus</HI> was unhappily begun the City: who was there slain by a wicked man with a Pickax at the command of <HI>Romulus,</HI> and interred in the same place. the <HI>Via Remoria</HI> extends it self from the <HI>Circo Maximo</HI> over the top of the <HI>Aventino</HI> just to that Fabrick of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the 3d. wherewith he fortified the City.</P>
<P>Here stands the Sepulchre of <HI>Cacus,</HI> of whom they make mention in the Fables of <HI>Hercules,</HI> which is a sharp broken stone in the midst of the Church <HI>Santa Maria Aventina,</HI> where also was anti∣ently a Temple of <HI>Hercules.</HI></P>
<P>At this <HI>Praecipice,</HI> were the <HI>Furcae Gemoniae,</HI> to which Malefactors were dragged with Iron hooks, and there inhumanely slain, hither the Emperour <HI>Vitellius,</HI> with an Iron hook fixed under his Chin, and his Cloths torn of to his Buttocks was dragged, and slain by the command of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> for having put to death <HI>Sabinus, Vespasians</HI> Brother.</P>
<P>The <HI>Porta Trigemina</HI> though very antient, remains yet almost en∣tire at the Foot of the <HI>Aventino</HI> near the <HI>Tyber</HI> in the Vineyard, to which the Baths of <HI>Trajan</HI> are annexed.</P>
<P>This Gate was called <HI>Trigemina,</HI> from the three twin Brothers, called <HI>Horatii,</HI> who marched out at that Gate, when they went to fight for the Liberty of their Countrey, against the three Brothers <HI>Curatii Albani,</HI> which <HI>Albani</HI> being slain with two of the twin Bro∣thers <HI>Horatii,</HI> the third returned triumphant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dioclesian</HI> Granaries of the <HI>Roman</HI> people were repaired and augmented by <HI>Dioclesian</HI> the Emperor, from whom they took their name. They stood between the <HI>Tyber</HI> and the <HI>Monte Testaceo,</HI> they consisted of 150 several apartments, and their ruines appear like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Vineyard of <HI>Julio Cesarino</HI> a <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monte Testaceo</HI> stands near them, which was raised by the pieces of Potters Vessels, there cast by the Potters whose streets were there, which place was assigned for that use that they might not throw them into the <HI>Tyber,</HI> for fear of stopping the current and diverting the stream to their greater damage, nor cast them into the Fields to obstruct the fertility thereof.

In old time the <HI>Circus Olimpicus</HI> comprehended all that space which the <HI>Monte Testaceo,</HI> takes up now</P>
<P>The Pyramid of <HI>C.

Cestius,</HI> yet tis believed to have been the common burying place of all the <HI>Septemviri Epuloni</HI> whose charge was to see that the Feasts, the Banquets, the solemni∣ties, and sacrifices of the Gods were strictly observed.</P>
<P><HI>La Porta Ostiense,</HI> (now named <HI>di San Paulo</HI>) was built by <HI>Ancus Martins,</HI> and called <HI>Ostiense,</HI> because through it lies the way to <HI>Ostia.</HI> Without which gate stands the Church dedicated to <HI>Sancto Paulo</HI> a most splendid Church, one of the seaven principal of <HI>Rome,</HI> and much frequented by the people. Therein stand four rankes of vast Marble Collumnes which support it. They are excellently wrought in <HI>Dorick, Ionick, Attick,</HI> and <HI>Corinthian</HI> works, nor is there any Church in <HI>Rome</HI> Replenisht with so many Pillars, nor garnished with so po∣lite and exquisite Marble stones, which were translated from the two <HI>Porta's Ostienses</HI> The one of <HI>Nero,</HI> the other of <HI>Anto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>inus.</HI> Some∣what beyond which stands another Church, called the <HI>Tre Fontane,</HI> An antient Temple before whose portal rise many pretious Pillars of Porphyr stone, which shine with various Colours: within are shewed three sources of Fountains, whose waters are esteemed holy and salutiferous for many infirmities, they believe, these Fountains to spring miraculously at and ever since the time that Saino <HI>Pauls</HI> head was cut off by the command of <HI>Nero</HI> the Emperour in that place.</P>

<P>ENtring from <HI>Borgo</HI> into the City by the Bridge <HI>Castello,</HI> you meet a way which divides it self in two, on the right hand towards the <HI>Tyber</HI> goes the <HI>Strada Julia,</HI> in which the house of the <HI>Cevali</HI> stands worthy a view, and in the other street near the <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>chi,</HI> is the house of the Cardinal <HI>Sforza,</HI> replenisht with Antiquities, noble Pictures, and a Library of Greek Manuscripts.</P>

At the end of the <HI>Parione</HI> are the ample houses <HI>Arianae,</HI> in whose Angle is seated That Statue of <HI>Pasquin,</HI> the most famous of all that City yea of all the World. This some suppose to be made for <HI>Hercules,</HI> others for <HI>Alexander</HI> the great: but there is no certainty of either, though it appear the workemankip of some rare Artist.</P>
<P>In former times they were wont to load this Image with Libels a∣against the Princes, Cardinals and famous Men, and noble Matrons and sometimes against the Pope: but now left off because of the se∣vere prohibitions, since when though they dare not fix them to the <HI>Pasquino,</HI> yet still they vent their reproofs and scandals under some other specious pretence, publishing them some other way by the name of <HI>Pasquinata. Antonio Tibaldeo a Ferrarian,</HI> being no less learned than Venerable, reports this story of this statue: That there was in <HI>Rome</HI> a certain Taylour well known in his trade and good at his oc∣cupation, called <HI>Pasquino,</HI> whose shop stood in this street: this man was well customed by <HI>Prelates, Courtezans</HI> and other people, who resorted to him for their Rayments, This Taylor employed great number of Journeymen, who like vile persons spent all the day their tongues freely speaking ill of this &amp; that person not sparing a∣ny, taking occasion from what they observed in those persons which resorted to their shop; the constant custome of slandering in that shop made it become ridiculous even to the persons offended, e∣steeming those rascals unworthy of any credit, and so no other re∣gard was had to it. Whence it came to pass afterwards, that if any person would defame another he did it under covert of Master <HI>Pas∣quino,</HI> saying he had heard say so in his shop, which relation caused all the Interessed persons in that reproach, not to make any more ac∣count of it. This reverent gentleman <HI>Pasquino</HI> being dead, it hap∣pened that in paving the street, this statue was found half buried and broken near his shop, which because twas incomodious for the passage to leave it there, they erected just at the shop of Master <HI>Pas∣quino▪</HI> whence the back-biters (taking a good occasion) reported that Master <HI>Pasquino,</HI> was returned again and not having courage e∣nough to own the abuses they put upon others, they used to fasten their Scrolls to that statue: presuming, that as twas lawfull for <HI>Mar co pasquino</HI> to speak any thing, so by means of this statue they might scandalize others with such things, as in the light and bare faced they durst not own. This Custome continued long till at last twas prohibited with severe penalties.</P>
<P>Near hereto is the great Pallace of the Chancery, built by the <HI>Travertini,</HI> in a square form with the stones translated from the Am∣phitheater of <HI>Titus Vespasianus,</HI> which was called <HI>Coliseum,</HI> which Theatre the Popes would not permit to be wholly destroyed, but left some part in its first Lustre, that by it might appear the splendour of the whole, as a testimony of the magnificence of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. In it stands one great Image of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> wrought by <HI>Michael Angelo Bonarota,</HI> at his first arrival at <HI>Rome,</HI> when he sought to depress the Fame of <HI>Raphael Sanctius</HI> of <HI>Urbin,</HI> which he brought in feriour to his own reputation by his Art and policy.

<P>Thence not far distant stands the Piazza <HI>del Duca,</HI> wherein is the fairest Pallace in <HI>Rome,</HI> built with excessive cost by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the 3d a <HI>Farnezian,</HI> It abounds with so many antiquities that to speak di∣stinctly of them, would fill up a volume: we will therefore pass briefly over them, as now they remain, many things having been changed in later times.</P>
<P>For the Architecture tis enough to say <HI>Michael Angelo Bonarota,</HI> had a chief part therein, and for the Materials, better could not be had then were employed in it, which were brought from the Amphithe∣atre: As to the statues,</P>
<P>Two of <HI>Hercules</HI> stand in the Court, famous for their workman∣ship and antiquity, the lesser whereof is most commended; One of <HI>Jupiter Tonante,</HI> with two immense sword players, the one having the Scabbard of his sword hanging at his shoulder, and with his right foot kicks the Target, the murrion, and the ground, the other holds behind him a boy dead in his hand: But that which surpasseth all statues is the <HI>Tauro Farnese,</HI> a Bull with five persons bigger than the natural, cut to wonder, out of one stone by <HI>Apollonius</HI> and <HI>Tauriscus</HI> of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> whence twas conveighed and placed in <HI>Antoninus</HI> his Bath where about one hundred years since twas dugg up as entire as if made but yesterday, and now stands in this Pallace astonishing all that behold it.</P>
<P>In the ascent on the stayers, you see one statue of the <HI>Tyber,</HI> ano∣ther of <HI>Oceanus,</HI> and at the top of two barbarous prisoners in their old habits.</P>
<P>In the Rooms above, who delights in Pictures and Sculpture will meet enough to occupy his whole fancy. As the Pictures of <HI>Francesco Salviati,</HI> and <HI>Tadeo Zucchero,</HI> both which are much applauded, drawn as if they were taking the fresh ayr: And in a Gallery which is as noble as well painted by the Brothers <HI>Carazzi Bolonia,</HI> painters of great Fame, you will find many antient heads of signal persons as of <HI>Lysia, Euripides, Solon, Socrates, Diogenes, Genone, Possidonio,</HI> and <HI>Se∣neca,</HI> with the noble statues of <HI>Ganimede, Antinoo,</HI> of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> some fair Vessels, and the statues of <HI>Meleager,</HI> which deserves a name by it self for its great price, being esteemed worth five thousand Crowns then which no statue in <HI>Rome</HI> is more entire. No People under the Sun give so great prices for statues as the <HI>Romans:</HI> all which are so studious of those kind of Ornaments, that in acquiring them, they emulously strive which shall exceed in cost or curiosity. In one Cham∣ber they shew the Duke <HI>Alexander</HI> of glorious memory, having un∣der his feet the River <HI>Scalda</HI> or <HI>Scelda,</HI> with <HI>Flanders</HI> kneeling before him, and behind Victory crowning him, all which statues are cut out of one Marble stone, bigger than the Life. There also are three doggs cast rarely in Brass. The <HI>Bibliotheque</HI> of this Pallace, the Meddals and carved Toyes, are most famous things, but the Pictures of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Titian</HI> are incomparable, nor are the Limnings lesse admira∣ble▪</P>
<P>Opposite to the <HI>Farnesi</HI> live the heirs of <HI>Monsignior d'Acquigno,</HI> in whose house are divers inscriptions, an <HI>Adonis,</HI> a <HI>Venus</HI> of four thousand Crowns price, a <HI>Diana</HI> begirt with a Quiver of Arrowes a Bow in

<P>Adjacent to the <HI>Campo di Fiore,</HI> stands the Palace of the Cardinal <HI>Capo di Ferro,</HI> much less than the <HI>Farnesian</HI> Pallace, but in splendor and Architecture no whit inferiour. In the Frontispiece is painted the spring time: The President of the spring is <HI>Venus,</HI> (which was drawn to the similitude of the Body of <HI>Livia Columna,</HI> a most beautiful Princess) &amp; whatever is there represented is amorous: The Complex∣ion of the men is sanguine, and all are marked with the Element of Ayr. So in the other fronts, are expressed the complexions Chol∣ler, Melancholy, and Phlegme, the Elements Fire, Water, and Earth, the seasons Summer, Autumne, and Winter, and the Prae∣siding Gods, <HI>Mars, Saturn,</HI> and <HI>Janus,</HI> which are most absolutely performed, and were the work of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> with whom this Cardinal contracted a most intimate Friendship; and being no less liberal than Jngenious obtained of him, what ever so rare an Artist could possibly invent, among the rest a secret conclave wherein ma∣ny things are exprest with the highest Art and perfection.</P>
<P>The house of the <HI>Orsini,</HI> in the <HI>Campo di Fiore,</HI> which was raised out of the ruines of the <HI>Pompeyan</HI> Theatre, is embellisht with many good statues in the Courts.</P>
<P>The Temple of Saint <HI>Angelo</HI> in <HI>Pescaria,</HI> was formerly of <HI>Juno Re∣gina,</HI> which being burnt, was restored by <HI>Septimius Severus</HI> and <HI>Mar∣cus Aurelius</HI> the Emperors, as the old Title there to be read verifies: near which are some of the Pillars taken from the <HI>Portico</HI> of <HI>Septimius Severus</HI> dedicated to <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P>At the Tower <HI>Citrangole,</HI> stands the house of the heirs of <HI>Gentile Delfino,</HI> which Gentleman had more meddals than any other Person in <HI>Rome,</HI> and his Garden filled with inscriptions: In them stands a Statue of <HI>Canopo</HI> placed in the form of a Water Pott, before whose breast they have preposed a Tablet filled with <HI>Hierogliphick</HI> letters, by which tis believed the secret Mysteries of the Sacrifices are delivered: In <HI>Parione</HI> at the house of the <HI>Maximi</HI> may be seen a <HI>Colossus,</HI> which vul∣garly is thought to be the statue of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> King of the <HI>Epirots</HI> armed, bought a long time since by the <HI>Maximi</HI> of <HI>Angelo</HI> for two thousand Crowns as also a Marble head of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> with many other things worthy consideration.</P>
<P>In the house of the <HI>Leni alla Ciambella,</HI> are many noble statues late∣ly brought thither from the <HI>Porta di S. Bastiano,</HI> to wit an <HI>Adonis,</HI> a <HI>Venus,</HI> a <HI>Satyr,</HI> and many excellent heads, where in an old Pile was found an entire purple Garment with some rings and other notable things. Near which stands the house of Cardinal <HI>Paravicino,</HI> a Sig∣nor of noble Qualities, who much delights in Pictures, whereof and those good too he hath not a few. Contiguous with which stands the house of the <HI>Vallei,</HI> wherein was erected a square Marble stone, with a <HI>Solar Horoscope,</HI> and the <HI>Zodiack</HI> signes, where the dayes and howers of every Moneth were denoted, and whatever the Antients were wont to observe as well in the sacrifices of the Gods, as in the Countrey affairs, as fully as our Calenders now express them: but this with divers other Rarities, by the instability of its Patrons, were amo∣ved, and such as they left remaining (for what reason we guess not) obscured.

On the Ascent of the <HI>Campidoglio</HI> dwels <HI>il Signor Lelio Pasqualino,</HI> a Canon of <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore,</HI> a Gentleman of polite learning, and exquisite manners, where the studious of Antiquities are freely ad∣mitted to glutt themselves with the most curious things in <HI>Rome,</HI> as select Meddals, rare carved works, Implements, and <HI>Habiliments</HI> of Antiquity in great number. In summ in his house are a Treasure of those things, and he hath observed in this kind more than a man can possibly behold in one day: if he be resolved to publish his ob∣servations for the pnblick good of the <HI>Ingeniosi,</HI> tis certain that a pure and naked index of the Antiquities which he hath collected, would alone advance the studious of good Letters no less in sacred then Profane Learning.</P>
<P>On the left hand of the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> raises it self a Temple and the Monastery of the <HI>Franciscans</HI> called <HI>Araceli,</HI> to which they ascend by 124 marble steps distinguished into five degrees: The Temple is supported by two ranks of Marble Pillars on both sides, then which the world affords not a more sumptuous, the <HI>Vatican</HI> set apart: This Temple in old time was dedicated to <HI>Jovi Feretrio</HI> by <HI>Romulus</HI> after the <HI>Sabyn</HI> warr, because in that place <HI>Jupiter</HI> gave assistance to the King then oppressed with the violence of his Enemies. On the left hand upon the third Pillar is engraven these words <HI>A Cubiculo Au∣gustorum,</HI> and in other places of the Church, are two statues of <HI>Constantine</HI> and <HI>Maximinian,</HI> and at the two horses of <HI>Castori</HI> set at the top of the steps, is represented a fair prospective from the en∣trance to the inward part.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Piazza</HI> of the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> stands a great statue of <HI>Marcus Au∣relius Antoninus,</HI> or as others think of <HI>Lucius Verus,</HI> of <HI>Septimius,</HI> of <HI>Metellus</HI> on horseback, twas transferred hither from <HI>San Gio Latera∣no,</HI> by order of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third a <HI>Farnesian.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Pallace rise great statues of Rivers, to wit of the <HI>Nyle,</HI> with a <HI>Sphinx</HI> under it, of the <HI>Tygre,</HI> with a <HI>Tyger</HI> near, both having their heads bedecked with flowers brought from the Rivers, and a∣nother great statue, by some thought to represent the <HI>Rhene</HI> a River of <HI>Germany,</HI> by others to be an Image of <HI>Jupiter Panarius,</HI> because the <HI>Romans</HI> freed themselves from the siege of the <HI>French</HI> by casting bread into their Tents: This Statue is called <HI>Marforio,</HI> and by means of it they use to answer to the slaunders of <HI>Pasqui∣no.</HI></P>
<P>Upon a collateral stayer. Case stands a Columne called <HI>Milliaria</HI> upon which are engraven two inscriptions the one of <HI>Vespasian</HI> the o∣ther of <HI>Nero</HI> Emperours.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Pallazzo dei Conservatori</HI> are many things worth a view, among others alyonholding a horse with his teeth, whose miraculous work∣manship <HI>Mic.

<P>The Church of <HI>Santa Martina</HI> (in whose angle the <HI>Colossus</HI> of <HI>Mar∣forii</HI> lies) was formerly consecrate to <HI>Mars Ultor</HI> the Revenger. <HI>Au∣gustus</HI> built and dedicated it after the <HI>Philippensian</HI> Warr in <HI>Pharsa∣lia:</HI> some say, That in this Church was the secret place where the Acts of the Senate were kept. In it is a Title made in the times of <HI>Theodosi∣us</HI> and <HI>Honorius</HI> the Emperors.</P>
<P>Next unto it is the Church of <HI>Santo Adriano,</HI> antiently the Tem∣ple of <HI>Saturn,</HI> built or rather restored by <HI>Manutio Planco,</HI> being first dedicated by <HI>Minutio</HI> &amp; <HI>Sempronio</HI> the Consuls: This was the Exche∣quer of <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein the publique Treasury was preserved as we read that in the time of <HI>Scipio Emilianus</HI> it had in it eleaven thousand pound weight of pure gold, and ninety two thousand pound weight of silver, beside an infinite quantity of coyned moneys. Here also the <HI>Tabulae Elephantinae</HI> were layed up, wherein the numbers of the 35 tribes of <HI>Rome,</HI> were recorded: as also the <HI>Military</HI> Ensignes, the Decrees of the Senate, the publick Acts, with the spoils of the Pro∣vinces and conquered Nations.</P>
<P>'Tis supposed that <HI>Santa Maria Liberatrice,</HI> was a Temple dedica∣ted to <HI>Venus Generatrix,</HI> It stands at the Foot of the <HI>Palatine,</HI> those three hollow Pillars some believe to be those before the foot of the <HI>Ponte aureo</HI> of <HI>Caligula,</HI> which was supported by 80 Pillars, made with incredible cost, over which they passed from the Pallace to the <HI>Ca∣pitoll.</HI></P>
<P>The Pillar at <HI>Santa Maria Liberatrice,</HI> is one of those upon which was placed the golden Statue by <HI>Domitian,</HI> near which stood the Sta∣tue of the River <HI>Rhene,</HI> now called <HI>Marforio</HI> and is in the <HI>Campido∣glio,</HI> Erected by <HI>Domitian</HI> for that that Emperor triumphed over the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>Near it was the Temple of <HI>Concord,</HI> with that of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> on its right hand, and that of <HI>Paulus AEmilius</HI> on its left hand, whose stru∣cture cost nine hundred thousand Crowns.</P>
<P>Those high wals which are beheld at the Foot of the <HI>Palatine</HI> are part of the <HI>Rostri Nuovi,</HI> which were so called for that there they setled the <HI>Rostra</HI> or stemm of their Galleys: here now is the Vineyard of Cardinal <HI>Farnese.</HI> There <HI>Cicero</HI> frequently made his O∣rations
<PB N="194" REF="112"/>
there the Fathers assembled and made Laws, and there the head and hand of <HI>Cicero</HI> (which wrote his Philippick Orations) were fixed to a Spear by command of <HI>Antonius</HI> the Triumvir, whose dishonourable deeds are therein declaimed against. The <HI>Rostri Vec∣chie,</HI> were in the <HI>Corte Hostilia,</HI> near the place of the Council which touched the Church <HI>Santa Maria Nuova,</HI> which place is called <HI>Comi∣tia</HI> as much as to say a place to retire themselves together in: for here the senate and People of <HI>Rome</HI> assembled to treat of the affairs of the the Common-Wealth: and there is built now the holy house of <HI>Sancta Maria de inferno.</HI></P>
<P>The Temple of <HI>San Lorenzo</HI> in <HI>Miranda,</HI> stands in the ruines of the Temple of <HI>Faustina</HI> and of <HI>Antonio,</HI> where we find this Inscription <HI>Divo Antonino, &amp; Divae Faustinae S. C.</HI> As also twelve fair Pillars, near which stood the Arch of <HI>Fabius,</HI> and the covering of the Palace▪ which was called <HI>Libone.</HI></P>
<P>The Piazza of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> extended from the Temple <HI>Faustina</HI> to that of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> but at the Piazza of <HI>Augustus</HI> the Church of <HI>Santo Adriano,</HI> in <HI>Trefori,</HI> is conjoyned with it, And in that of <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI> were certain Porticues and in them statues of illustrious Men set up by <HI>Augustus</HI> who lived in the house of <HI>Livia,</HI> in the <HI>Via Sacra.</HI> The Temple of <HI>Santi Cosmo</HI> and <HI>Damiano,</HI> was antiently dedicated to <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux</HI> which some alledge without foundation to be the Temple of <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus.</HI></P>
<P>The Temple of Peace, begun by <HI>Clandius</HI> and finished by <HI>Vespasi∣an,</HI> was most magnificent and stately, of whose most high stru∣cture some reliques yet remain not far from the Church of <HI>Santa Ma∣ria Nova,</HI> and one Pillar yet entire, the highest and biggest of all <HI>Rome</HI> In the gardens of <HI>Santa Maria Nova,</HI> appear yet two high round cour∣ses of two antient Temples of the Sun and Moon, which some will have to be of <HI>Isis</HI> &amp; <HI>Serapis.</HI> There <HI>Tatius</HI> built a Temple to <HI>Vulcan,</HI> and in that quarter <HI>AEsculapius</HI> also had a Temple, and <HI>Concordia,</HI> built by <HI>Fulvius</HI> in <HI>anno</HI> 303. after the erecting of the Capitol: Out of which Temple of <HI>Concordia,</HI> tis thought <HI>Vespasian</HI> afterwards raised that of Peace, translating to it moreover many ornaments from the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> after he had destroyed <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI></P>
<P>Not far distant from the <HI>Via sacra,</HI> stands the Marble Arch of <HI>Titus Vespasian,</HI> wherein are carved the pomp of the Triumph, and the spoyls brought from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the overthrow of the <HI>Jewes,</HI> as the Ark of the Covenant the Candlestick for the seaven Lights, The Table whereon they set the bread of the Proposition or shewbread The Table of the ten Commandements delivered by God to <HI>Moses,</HI> and the sacred Vessels all of pure gold, used in the sacrifices by the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> besides which the Triumphal Chariot of the Emperor is carved thereon with this Inscription.

Which to revenge <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> (Who studied the Magick Art) effected that the Fire in the whole City was extinguished, and all the people forced to give fire to their Candles and Lights at the flames which were raised for shaming of the Strumpets. This fable is painted every where but without an Au∣thor: Nor is it likely any such thing could happen to that great <HI>Vir gil,</HI> who for his continency was called <HI>Parthe nius.</HI> If any thing in this Fable be true I suppose twas writ of some other <HI>Virgil</HI> a Magician by whom the <HI>Neapolitanes</HI> speak also many things to have been per∣formed: among others that by the Magick Art he hollowed the Mountain <HI>Posylipum</HI> and made it penetrable, the Sepulchre of <HI>Virgil</HI> is erected near this famous Cavern.</P>
<P>Near the Temple of Peace is that of the <HI>Santi Cosmo</HI> and <HI>Damiano,</HI> which was the Court of <HI>Romulus,</HI> where the Senate congregated when they had any important affair to consult about: It was whol∣ly burnt, when they burned the body of <HI>Publius Claudius,</HI> slain by <HI>T.

<P>Towards <HI>Santa Maria Nova, Scaurus</HI> had a noble Palace with an Open gallery supported with Pillars forty foot high without the ba∣ses or capitol.</P>
<P>The great Palace <HI>Gregostaci,</HI> was so denominated, for that there they usually entertained the Embassadors of divers Nations: Here <HI>Quintus Flaminius</HI> dedicated a statue to <HI>Concordia,</HI> when he had re∣conciled the People to the Senate, or rather the Senate to the Peo∣ple. The Church <HI>Sant' Andrea,</HI> in <HI>Pallaria,</HI> is the old Temple, where∣in the <HI>Palladium</HI> and <HI>Penati,</HI> which <HI>AEneas</HI> brought with him from <HI>Troy</HI> into <HI>Italy</HI> were at first placed, but afterwards transported into the Temple of <HI>Vesta,</HI> and the charge of them committed to the Vestal Virgins.

<P>At the foot of Mount <HI>Palatine,</HI> to wit at the Pillars of the Gallery of <HI>Caligula,</HI> is a round Fabrick, being the Church <HI>S.

<HEAD>The <HI>GIRCO MASSIMO,</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the Ornaments of the <HI>Circo Maximo</HI> scarce any thing is to be seen, more than the entire circumscription of the place whereby its amplitude is discerned: It lies between the <HI>Palatino,</HI> and the <HI>Aventino,</HI> and is about half a mile long and three Acres broad which some say was capable of 260 thousand men, others restrain it to one hundred and fifty thousand. Here <HI>Romulus</HI> first set forth the <HI>Consaulian Games</HI> to the God <HI>Conso,</HI> after the rape of the <HI>Sabyn</HI> Women. <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> designed and <HI>Tarquinius Superbus</HI> built the place, for the celebration of the <HI>Circensian</HI> games, and other Sola∣ces for the People, which <HI>Augustus</HI> adorned, <HI>Gaius</HI> amplified, <HI>Trajan</HI> repaired and augmented the Fabrick, and <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> paved it. At present tis all about in Gardens, but some steps and roofs of little cels remain, which are supposed to have been the Offices of the A∣ctors in the Games, or of such as uttered beer and other necessaries, to the People resorting to the shews. Others think them to haue been the stews wherein the Whores dwelt, exposing their bodies to sale for gaine. <HI>Neptune</HI> had a Temple conjoined with this Circ, where∣of some ruines are yet to be seen incrusted with Fish shels. Where the Church of <HI>S. Anastatia</HI> stands, were erected two Obelisks, the one of which being 132 foot long without the bases, was translated by <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. to the <HI>Vatican,</HI> the other was 88. foot high. <HI>Augu∣stus</HI> transported both out of <HI>AEgypt,</HI> for adorning the Circ: where∣in also was the <HI>Naumachia</HI> for exercising Sea-fights: a place now con∣sisting of boggs and Reeds: where also part of those waters flowed which by an Aqueduct were conveighed into the Circ, called <HI>Aquae Claudiae.</HI></P>

<P>On the right hand of the Church Saint <HI>Sebastiano,</HI> stands an en∣tire Temple but dispoiled of its ornaments, formerly dedicated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> into which the Shepherds to preserve their Flooks, from the heats of the day, and incomodities of the nights do often drive them.</P>
<P>About forty paces farther in the adjacent sields, amongst thorns and brambles, in an obscure place, is a <HI>subterranean Cavern.</HI> whose entrance through the heaps of stones is difficultly found, but when entred, you behold Vaults built with good Art, on each side of which are long repositories, wherein the bodies of deceased Christians, whom twas not lawfull to bury solemnly or openly were reposed. In these Cavernes were the primitive Christians wont to conceal themselves, to fly the Emperors raging persecutions, now called <HI>Stanze de Christiani.</HI></P>

<P>Beyond that upon the <HI>Via Appia,</HI> rises the Walls of a square Castle very entire: which some believe to have been <HI>Sinvessa,</HI> others <HI>Pa∣metia,</HI> but the most to be credited averr it to be the <HI>Stanza</HI> or abi∣ding place of the <HI>Praetorian</HI> Souldiers, within these walls is a spatious Concave.</P>

The heads amount to the number of 200. Sacrificed to the God <HI>Capode Boi,</HI> and the An∣tiquaries will have, that at the famous Sepulchre of <HI>Cecilia Metella</HI> a double <HI>Hecatombe</HI> was performed. At the Foot of the neighbou∣ring Hill, if you pronounce a whole heroick verse, an admirable Eccho returns it whole, and articulately for the most part, and con∣fused otherwhiles eight times answered: In no place is heard so rare an Eccho, which is said to be excited by artifice, that at the Fu∣neral of this <HI>Caecilia Metella,</HI> the ejaculations of the weepers and the funeral houlings might immensely be multiplyed, while that double <HI>Hecatombe</HI> was celebrating, and the Funest duties perfor∣med in honour of that Matron.</P>

<P>Above the Circ riseth an entire Temple four squared, with Pil∣lars, and Corridores before it: Which as is supposed was dedica∣ted to the <HI>Dio Ridicolo,</HI> uppon this occasion: <HI>Hannibal</HI> having slain 40 thousand Romans at the battail of <HI>Cannae,</HI> marched with his vi∣ctorious Army to the siege of <HI>Rome,</HI> and pitched his Camp in that very place: where a diffused Laughter being heard over his Camp it caused a prodigious fear, and that made him raise the Siege and retreat to the <HI>Terra di Lavoro:</HI> which had he obstinatly continued some time longer, (having created such a consternation in the Citi∣zens) he had undoubtedly taken <HI>Rome</HI> with small difficulty: but as <HI>Livy</HI> saies an <HI>Affrican</HI> told <HI>Hannibal,</HI> He knew how to obtain but not how to make use of Victory. Thus was <HI>Rome</HI> delivered from <HI>Hanni∣bal:</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI> in commemoration of so great a benefit received from the God of Laughter, consecrated that Temple to the <HI>Dio Ridicoloso.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MONTE CELIO.</HEAD>
<P>Leaving the Wall on the right hand of the <HI>Porta Gabiosa,</HI> you ascend <HI>Monte Celio,</HI> wch runs along by the wall to the <HI>Porta Maggiore.</HI> This Hill was antiently called <HI>Querquetulano,</HI> from the multitude of Oaks growing thereon, before the <HI>Tuscans</HI> inhabited it: to whom licence was given to dwell in the Bourg <HI>Tosco,</HI> because they marched under their Captain <HI>Cloche Vibenna,</HI> to the assistance of the <HI>Romans</HI> against their Enemies. On this Hill at this day rests no Antique thing of mo∣ment, more than the infinite ruines of Fabricks. One part of it is na med <HI>Celiolo,</HI> where stands a Church of <HI>Santo Giovanni Evangelista,</HI> cal∣led <HI>ante Portam Latinam,</HI> which was antiently a Temple sacred to <HI>Diana.</HI> On the top of the <HI>Celio,</HI> is a round Church dedicated to <HI>S. Stefano,</HI> by Pope <HI>Simplicio,</HI> from being a Temple of <HI>Faunus,</HI> whose antiquity threatning destruction, <HI>Nicholas</HI> the fifth repaired it, and <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth beautifyed it with Pictures of Martyrs and Saints.</P>
<P><HI>Curia Hostilia</HI> stood where now is <HI>Santi Giovanni</HI> and <HI>Paulo</HI> towards the <HI>Settizonio</HI> of <HI>Severus,</HI> built by <HI>Tullius Hostilius,</HI> different from that in the <HI>Foro Romano,</HI> Here the Senate assembled for state af∣fairs.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>S. Maria</HI> in <HI>Domenica</HI> is seated towards the <HI>Aven∣tino,</HI> and was restored by <HI>Leo</HI> the 10th. here antiently stood the Dwellings of the <HI>Albani,</HI> and near them the Aqueduct for the <HI>A∣qua Claudia,</HI> in the Arch whereof are engraven these words <HI>P. Corn R. F. Dolabella, Cos. C. Junius C. P. Silanus Flamen Martial. Ex S. C. Fa∣ciundum curaverunt. Idemque Probaverunt.</HI></P>
<P>By the same Aqueduct stands a great Fabrick as a conservatory of the Waters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Castra Peregrina</HI> stood in old time where the Church of <HI>Santi quatro Coronati,</HI> was built by Pope <HI>Honorius,</HI> and restored by <HI>Paschal</HI> the second. In those Castles they used to rendezvouz and accom∣modate the People for Sea affairs, which <HI>Augustus</HI> used to keep in the ordinary Fleet at <HI>Niseno.</HI> Between the <HI>Porta Gabiusa,</HI> and <HI>Celi∣montana</HI> abound great ruines of the Palace of <HI>Constantine</HI> the great (called now <HI>S. Giovanni</HI>) by which may be comprehended the mag∣nificent state and splendor of that Emperor.</P>
<P><HI>San Giovanni in Laterano</HI> keeps its antient name built by <HI>Constan∣tine</HI> the Great at the instance of Pope <HI>Sylvester</HI> formerly the Seat of the <HI>Roman Pontifices</HI> at first called <HI>Romae Episcopi</HI> Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> but afterwards (induced thereunto by the pleasantness of the <HI>Vatican</HI> Hills) they translated their habitation thither, building a renowned Palace near St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church.</P>
<P>Near the said Church stands <HI>Il Battisterio di Constantino:</HI> of an orbicu∣lar form sustained by 8. porphyr Pillars: Report saith that <HI>Constan∣tine</HI> the Great labouring under a Leaprosie, at the perswasions of

his Phisicians resolved to bath himself in the blood of Infants, and for that intent erected this sumptuous structure: but being ad∣monished in a dream to bath himself in holy water in the name of Jesus Christ the true God, whom <HI>Helena</HI> his Mother worshipped, the Emperor obeyed the Celestial admonition, and was baptized in that porphyr Font now in the said Temple: For the truth hereof the Reader is desired to consult his own thought: It not being likely, that so magnificent a structure should be built and intended for perpetra∣ting that notorious crime, which should rather be kept close and tacitely concealed, than published with such vain ostentation; besides that Historians say he was baptized by the <HI>Nichomedian</HI> Bishop, when he arrived in <HI>Asia, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>isardo</HI> thinks that the said <HI>Battisteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> was rather the Bath to the <HI>Lateran</HI> Pallace and the Form of the Fabrick indu∣ceth him and others to the same belief: But however it was tis most certain that <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, having profest the Christian Re∣ligion, was baptized in this Church and the same <HI>Babtistary</HI> tis shew∣ed to this day, and all converts to the Christian Religion, are there still baptized. On the right hand of it are certain holy chappels, and therein preserved many pretious Marbles and some Pillars convey∣ed hither from <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>At the entrance of the Church <HI>San Giovanni Laterano,</HI> stand many sumptuous Tombs of Popes, and Altars wrought excellently with Marble, upon the high Altar is the last supper of Christ ingraven in silver of great value, set up by <HI>Clement</HI> the seaventh, who also rai∣sed, the great rich Organ, and that stately Vestry for the use of the Church.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Chorus</HI> were four hollow brasen Pillars of <HI>Corinthian</HI> work, which tis said were brought from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> full of the holy Earth where our Saviour was enterred, others say that <HI>Sylla</HI> fetched them from <HI>Athens,</HI> and others that <HI>Augustus</HI> caused them to be cast in <HI>Rome</HI> of the Beaks of the Galleys taken in the <HI>Actiack</HI> battail and in memorial applyed to the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Capitolino.</HI> Furthermore others say that <HI>Vespasian</HI> translated them with the other spoils from <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Of late, <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. caused them to be guilt over, and placed them on the high Altar, with a brass Scutcheon guilt and affixed to them, wherein his Arms are engraven.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. reedified from the foundations the <HI>Latera∣nian</HI> Palace, there was a great hall, where the Pope with the <HI>Eccle∣siastical</HI> Synod of Cardinals and Arch-bishops rendred themselves when they were to manage any substantial business. Those three great marble Collumnes were shipped from the Palace in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> here the <HI>Later ane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sial</HI> counsels were solemnized with the assistance of the whole Clergy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scala Sancta,</HI> contained 28 stairs which stood in <HI>Pilats</HI> House the which Christ ascended when he was whipped, are transferred by the Pope into another place where Christians frequent them and for devotion creep up them upon their knees kissing them.</P>
<P>Here were two porphyr chairs, whereof the Enemies of the Ca∣tholick Faith recount certain shamefull Fables which have been suffi∣ciently confuted by Cardinal <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> in his first Tome of the con∣troversies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop, as also the story of Pope <HI>Joan</HI> whom the story saies to be <HI>John</HI> the 7th: who succeeded <HI>Leo</HI> the 4th. con∣futed

by the said Cardinal and <HI>Onofrius,</HI> and lately by <HI>Florimondo Ro∣mondo</HI> in <HI>French,</HI></P>
<P>The Pillar of white Marble placed in the wall, and divided in two is thought to be broken miraculously at the death of Christ, when the Veyl of the Temple rent.</P>
<P><HI>Sancta Sanctorum</HI> is a Chappel held in great veneration, the ingress therein is forbidden to women: In it are kept the Ark of the Cove∣nant, the rod of <HI>Aaron,</HI> the Table whereon Christs last supper was celebrated: of the sacred <HI>Manna,</HI> the Navil string and praepuce of Christ, a Vyal of Christs blood, some thorns of his Crown, one whole Nail wherewith he was fastened to the Cross. The Snaffle of <HI>Constantine</HI> the great his Horse, which was made of the two nayls which pierced his feet, the fourth was placed in the Emperors gol∣den Diademe. In the same place are likewise shewed many Re∣liques which are regarded by the <HI>Romans</HI> with huge Devotion: here is to be observed that the old pictures of the Greeks, and <HI>Gregory,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Turona</HI> shew, that Christ was fastened to the Cross, with two nails in his feetand a little table under.</P>
<P>Somewhat distant from <HI>S. Giovanni,</HI> stands a Gate of the City called now by the same name, but antiently <HI>Celimontana</HI> from Mount <HI>Celio</HI> Hence the <HI>Via Campagna</HI> takes its beginning leading to the <HI>Campagna</HI> called <HI>Terra di Lavoro</HI> from its sterility: Forth the City it joines with the <HI>Latina.</HI></P>
<P>On the back part of <HI>Monte Celio,</HI> lyes the Church <HI>Santa Croce di Jerusalem,</HI> one of the seaven chief, formerly sacrate to <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Cu∣pid,</HI> In it is kept a part of the Lords Cross, and the title of the Cross writ in three languages, one of the thirty pence, which <HI>Judas</HI> the Traitor received for betraying Christ, a Thorn of the Crown, with other sacred Reliques.</P>
<P>Here under the Earth <HI>Helena</HI> the mother of <HI>Constantine</HI> built a Chap∣pel, wherein Women are permitted entrance only upon the 20th. of <HI>March,</HI> to the Monastery of this Temple is adjoyned an Amphi∣theatre, somewhat less but more antient than the <HI>Coliseo,</HI> which was edificated by <HI>Statilius Taurus,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Augustus:</HI> but twas for the most part destroyed by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the 3d. for reparation of the Monastery. On one side of <HI>Santa Croce</HI> appear yet some ruines of the <HI>Basilica Sessariana,</HI> near the Walls.</P>
<P>The Arches which enter the City by <HI>Porta Nevia,</HI> and pass over the top of the <HI>Celio,</HI> to the <HI>Aventino,</HI> were the Arches for the Aqueduct of the <HI>Claudian</HI> water: and were the highest and longest of <HI>Rome, Claudius</HI> conveighed this water from forty miles off into the City; Some of this water run into the Palace, some into the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> but the greatest part to the <HI>Aventino:</HI> The said <HI>Porta Nevia,</HI> was also called <HI>Nevia,</HI> and <HI>Santa Croce</HI> and was built in an Arch Triumphal, which demonstrates the Majesty and grandeur of the work.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Aqueduct</HI> for the <HI>Aqua Claudia</HI> towards <HI>Monte Celio,</HI> stands the Hospital S. <HI>Giovanni</HI> being both wealthy and comodious for re∣ceipt of infirm and sick Persons, abounding in all sorts of Phisical ingredients, Physicians, Apothecaries, Surgeons, attendants, and whatever els can conduce to the good of the Patients: This conve∣niency hath in all ages induced many Princes and other Persons of quality and riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, when their Maladies require, to make this Hospi∣tal

<P>The Temple of S. <HI>Clement</HI> Pargetted with various coloured Mar∣ble, hath divers old inscriptions, many figures of the sacred in stru∣ments used in the divine services by the Popes as also in the Sacrifices by the Priests of the Gentiles and the Southsayers.</P>
<P>In the return you meet that stupendious and admirable Mole the Amphitheatre, called vulgarly <HI>Coliseo</HI> from the <HI>Colossean</HI> statue of 120 foot high, which <HI>Nero</HI> erected. The altitude of this Amphithe∣atre was such, and the structure so compact, that <HI>Rome</HI> afforded no∣thing more stately. 'Twas eleaven yeers continued labour for thirty thousand Slaves, and capable of eighty seaven thousand men, who might conveniently dispose theselves in the surrounding Seats for be holding the Playes there yeerly exhibited.</P>
<P>The house of <HI>Nero</HI> occupying all that space between the Hils <HI>Pa∣latino</HI> and <HI>Celio,</HI> reached to the <HI>Esquilie,</HI> so ample that it had more the face and semblance of a City, than of a single house, within were com∣prehended Fields, Lakes, Woods, and a Gallery of a mile long, with three ranks of Pillars, many of its Chambers were guilt and ador∣ned with gems: and the Temple dedicated to <HI>Fortuna Seia,</HI> had in it an Image of the same Goddesse of transparent Mar∣ble.</P>
<P>On the left hand stands the Arch Triumphal of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, as yet whole and perfect with all his victories and statues car∣ved on it. This Arch was erected in honour of that Emperor by the <HI>Romans</HI> after he had overcome at <HI>Ponte Milvio, Maxentius,</HI> who had tyrannically oppressed <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> At present they manage horses in the <HI>Coliseo.</HI> And near it rises a proud Fabrick in form of a Pyra∣mid, which was called <HI>La Meta Sudante,</HI> for that thence issued Streams of water, whereof such as had disposed themselves in the Amphitheatre to see the sports, had given them to satisfie their thirsts when desired by any.

<P>LEaving the Castle Saint <HI>Angelo</HI> on the right hand of the <HI>Torre Sanguina,</HI> passing through the street <HI>Orso,</HI> where it divides you find the house of <HI>Bildo Ferratino</HI> in the frontispiece whereof stands a statue of <HI>Galba the</HI> Emperor with other figures.</P>
<P>In the Palace of the Duke of <HI>Altemps,</HI> they shew many mo∣numents of Antiquity, Epitaphs, Inscriptions, aud Reliques which wonderfully delight the eyes of skilfull Artists, and ingenious Men,
<PB N="205" REF="117"/>
among others the statue of <HI>Seneca,</HI> the Philosopher and the Vestry and Chapel of the Duke, clear demonstrations of the piety and religion of the Patrones. Near it stands the house of Cardinal <HI>Gae∣tano</HI> containing some rare Antique statues.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>Navova</HI> is the Church of S. <HI>Apollinare</HI> formerly the Tem∣ple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and behind it the Church of Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> where the Tombe of <HI>Santa Monica</HI> his Mother is shewed with her Reliques.</P>
<P>That spatious Court before the Palace of the Dutchess of <HI>Parma,</HI> corruptly called <HI>Piazza Navona,</HI> was formerly the <HI>Circo Agonale,</HI> wher∣in they exhibited the <HI>Agonalian</HI> fights and games instituted by <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> in honour of <HI>Janus. Nero</HI> augmented this Circ, and so did <HI>Alexander</HI> the Son of <HI>Manca,</HI> who erected also near it a Palace and the famous <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Hot baths. Hereabouts also <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Adri∣an</HI> had their Baths. but the continued edifices there have lost the ve∣ry foundations of the old structures.</P>
<P>In the house of the Bishops of <HI>Saula,</HI> is shewed the Head of M. <HI>Tul lius Cicero,</HI> in that of <HI>Alexander Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ino,</HI> the Image of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> Ar∣med, like a <HI>Colossus,</HI> with his thighs neatly harnessed after the old∣fashion, and oposite to it, another of the same heighth, and vests of <HI>Octavius Caesar.</HI> Then which statues, <HI>Rome</HI> scarce affords any thing of better workmanship.</P>
<P>Those round and high Arches which rise in that place called the <HI>Ciambella,</HI> are reliques of the Bathes of <HI>M. Agrippa:</HI> near which <HI>Ne∣ro</HI> built others, whose Fragments shew themselves behind S. <HI>Eusta∣chio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M.

Others say he dedicated it to Ope, and <HI>Cibele,</HI> as mother of the Gods, and Mistress of the Earth. Afterwards the Popes consecrated it to the Blessed Virgin and all the Saints. It hath no windowes, being in lieu thereof supplyed with light from a great Open space at top, the rain water driving there through is re∣ceived into a large brass Vessel at the bottom, which in old time was covered with plates of silver but <HI>Constantine</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Heracli∣us</HI> took away that with the other ornaments of the City; antiently twas ascended to by 7 steps, but now who enters it must descend 18. steps, whereby appears how vast are the heaps of ruines.

<P>A great arch now old, rude, and divested of all its ornaments,
<PB N="206" REF="118"/>
stood near it, called <HI>Camiliano,</HI> which they think to be built by <HI>Camillus,</HI> but falsly, for those kind of works were first set a foot in the reigns of the Emperors: sometime since, this Arch was by li∣cence of Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. pulled down by Cardinal <HI>Salviano,</HI> who with those stones amplified his own adjacent Palace, near this Arch lay a foot of a <HI>Colossus</HI> very great, which is supposed to be trans∣ferred to the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> where tis now obvious.</P>
<P>In the house of <HI>Paulus de Castro,</HI> is seen the head of <HI>Socrates,</HI> with his whole breast, and many other things which will recreate the spectator: In the Palace of <HI>S.

<P>All those things wherewith of old the Court of <HI>Nerva</HI> was garni∣shed, are either by age decayed, or translated to some other place tis called also <HI>Foro Transitorio,</HI> because over it they walked to go to the <HI>Foro Augusto</HI> and <HI>Romano,</HI> for which reason that Church is cal∣led <HI>S.

<P>Here also lies the <HI>Foro Trajano,</HI> between the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> the <HI>Qui∣rinale,</HI> and the <HI>Foro Augusto,</HI> this was environed with a magnificent gallery sustained with noble pillars, whereof <HI>Apolliodorus</HI> was Ar∣chitector and adorned with statues, Images, and a triumphal Mar∣ble Arch, of all which nought remains, except two of the Pillars at <HI>Santa Maria di Loreto.</HI> And one Collumne spread over within with Cockle shells, which demonstrates the splendor and Majesty of the Emperors; tis 128 foot high besides the bases, which is 12. foot more: tis raised by 24 stones only, but they so vast, that it appears the work of Gyants, every one of those stones hath eight stayers by which they get up inwardly to the top, which are enlightned by 44 Casements. Round it are carved the noble Acts of <HI>Caesar Tra∣jano</HI> in the <HI>Dacian</HI> Warr. No part of the world can boast a work more admirable, or more magnificent.

<P>THe hill <HI>Viminale</HI> is next to the <HI>Esquilino,</HI> and runs along by the Walls: twas so named from a famous Temple dedicated to <HI>Jupiter Viminale:</HI> whence also the contiguous Gate took the name <HI>Viminale</HI> and <HI>Nomentana,</HI> from the way leading to <HI>Nomento,</HI> which is now called <HI>S.

<P>In the <HI>Via Nomentana</HI> a little farther is the <HI>Ponte Nomentano</HI> built by <HI>Narsetes</HI> the Eunuch under <HI>Justinian</HI> the Emperor, as the inscription testifies. <HI>Nero</HI> the Emperour, between the <HI>Porta Suburbana,</HI> and <HI>Sala∣ria,</HI> had <HI>Suburbano</HI> a singular edifice, which he gave to a Freed Man who fearinga publique punishment by a poynard thrust into his brest and the help of <HI>Sporo</HI> another freed Man slew himself: some ruines of this Fabrick yet remain.</P>

<P>Here the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Fryers had a comodious habitation: which some time since they surrendred to the Apostolick Chamber, oppo∣site whereto is a Pontifical Palace, built by <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th. for their cool retreat in hot weather; whence somewhat, in the <HI>Vigna</HI> of the <HI>Colonnesi,</HI> raiseth it self the <HI>Frontispiece</HI> of <HI>Neros</HI> Pallace, vulgarly called <HI>Frontone di Nerone,</HI> Hence <HI>Nero</HI> beheld the Fire which was by his own incendiaries kindled in the City of <HI>Rome</HI> which afterwards he imputed to the Christians, that by this Calumny he might draw them into hatred with the Senate and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> and by a pu∣blick edict commanded, that as many as were apprehended, confes∣sing Christ for God should be burnt and excarnified in <HI>Neros</HI> gar∣dens which Persecution continued three days.</P>

<P>Near hereto is the place vnlgarly called <HI>Bagnanapoli,</HI> that is <HI>Bagni di Paulo,</HI> because they were made by <HI>Paulus AEmilius:</HI> The Monastery of the Nuns of Saint <HI>Benedict</HI> built by Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the 5th. and the Palace of the <HI>Conti,</HI> rise out of the ruins of those Baths, whereof to this day some small fragments are extant.

<P>FRom the Bourg taking the way over <HI>Ponte Elio,</HI> you up against the streams of the Tyber meet the Church <HI>San Biasio,</HI> at <HI>Ripetta,</HI> which is supposed to have been the Temple of <HI>Neptune,</HI> amplified by <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor: here such as had escaped any re∣markable shipwrack, hung up Tablets containing the particulars of their deliverance and their vows for it to the God of the Sea.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Valle Martia,</HI> by the Church of <HI>San Rocco</HI> stands the <HI>Mau∣seolo,</HI> of <HI>Augustus</HI> being a Sepulchre erected by <HI>Octavius</HI> for him∣self and she successors of the <HI>Caesarian</HI> Family, out of the ruins and with the Materials of that Amphitheatre (which he destroy∣ed) that <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> built there; its Circuit is yet entire divided into a figure four square lozanged. In this <HI>Mauseolo,</HI> stands a <HI>Matrona</HI> holding a <HI>Cornucopia</HI> with Fruit, and an <HI>AEsculapius</HI> as bigg as a Gyant with a Serpent.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Mauseolo,</HI> were also heretofore two Obelisks of <HI>Granito,</HI> 42 foot high.</P>
<P>The Circ of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> extended from this <HI>Mauseolo</HI> to the foot of the neighbouring Mountain, <HI>Augustus</HI> had a Palace opposite to it▪ with a stately Gallery, and had here consecrated a Grove to the Gods of Hell, reaching from the Church <HI>Santa Maria del Popolo</HI> to S. <HI>Trinita.</HI></P>
<P>Some say that <HI>Marcellus</HI> his Sepulchre was contiguous with this <HI>Mauseolo,</HI> and shew its very <HI>Track:</HI> which <HI>Boisardo,</HI> believes rather to belong to the <HI>Mauseolo,</HI> and not a distinct Edifice.</P>
<P><HI>Augustus</HI> also had made a place called <HI>Naumachia</HI> for Naval Diver∣sions in the lower part of the <HI>Valle Martia,</HI> (looking towards the
<PB N="213" REF="121"/>
Hill <HI>Santa Trinita</HI> which <HI>Domitian</HI> restored being decayed through antiquity, and called it after his own name, placing near it a Tem∣ple to the Family <HI>Flavia:</HI> where now Saint <HI>Silvestro</HI> stands.</P>

<P>The <HI>Via Flaminia</HI> took its name from <HI>Flaminius</HI> the Consul, who paved it after the conquest of the <HI>Genovesi</HI> now tis called the <HI>Corso:</HI> for that at some time of the yeer, boys and certain animals run here striving who shall arrive first at the end of the course. This way goes from the <HI>Porta Flaminia</HI> (called heretofore <HI>Flumentana</HI> from its vicinity to the Tyber but at this day <HI>Porta del popolo</HI>) to <HI>Pesaro,</HI> and to <HI>Rimini.</HI> Near this way lye many gardens filled with inscriptions chiefly those of Cardinal <HI>Lovisio, Justiniano, Gallo, Altemps</HI> and o∣thers.</P>
<P>By this Way Pope <HI>Julius</HI> the third accomodated a Vineyard with such ornaments, as for cost and magnificence surpassed all others in <HI>Rome,</HI> and as an Inscription attests, conducted to the publik way a Fountain for the benefit of all persons, wherein tis scarce to be jud∣ged which ought most to be applauded, the ingenuity of the Arti∣tificers, or the sumptuousness and splendour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Chief Bi∣shops.</P>
<P>Beyond this lies <HI>Ponte Molli.</HI> where the Tyrant <HI>Maxentius</HI> was over∣come by <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great: which Tyrant that he might not be carried alive in the Triumphs of <HI>Constantine</HI> cast himself headlong off the Bridge into the <HI>Tyber.</HI> Afterwards in honour of <HI>Constantine</HI> was erected the Triumphal Arch between the <HI>Coliseo</HI> and the <HI>Setti∣zonio</HI> of <HI>Severus.</HI></P>
<P>Returned into the City by the <HI>Porta Flaminia</HI> you find the Arch of <HI>Domitian,</HI> called <HI>di Portogallo,</HI> because in that quarter the Embas∣sador of <HI>Portugall</HI> resi ded. Tis also called <HI>Tripoli,</HI> a rude and incompact structure, having nothing of moment in it more than the statue of <HI>Domitian,</HI> which some too will not have to be his, but the statue and Arch of <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperor.</P>
<P>The Church of Saint <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> in <HI>Lucina,</HI> was sacred to <HI>Juno Lu cina,</HI> and yet retains its old name, here of old, breeding women and such as lay in Childbed, after the birth used to pay their vows, because by the good will of the Goddess, not only themselves were preserved in that great peril, but the Life of their tender In∣fants.</P>
<P>In the street <HI>de Condotti,</HI> in the house of the <HI>Bosii,</HI> some notable and old inscriptions are extant. In the Palace of the Spanish Embas∣sador a fair and Copious Fountain. In that of <HI>Dionigio Octaviano Sa∣da,</HI> (who translated the old Dialogues of <HI>D. Antonio Augustino,</HI> into <HI>Italian,</HI>) a good number of rare things in this kind. In that of the <HI>Ruzzelai,</HI> a Gallery filled with old statues of rare artifice, and in the Court, a very large brazen horse. And in that of the Cardinal <HI>Desa,</HI> now building, we assure our selves of rare Architecture and great Curiosities.</P>

<P>Between <HI>Santa Maria del Popolo,</HI> and the <HI>Porta Flaminia,</HI> is seen an O∣belisk, filled with Hieroglyphicks, and <HI>AEgiptian Letters:</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> writes, to be one hundred and ten foot long, and to contain on it the interpretation of the <HI>AEgyptian</HI> Philosophy. <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> cau∣sed it to be transferred from <HI>Hieropoli</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> with two others, which he placed in the <HI>Circus Maximus.</HI> On the Pedestal is this In∣scription. <HI>Caesar.

And that of <HI>Giacomo Giacovazzo,</HI> not a few excellent statues in Marble and Brass, and other Curiosi∣ties.</P>
<P><HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> in that part of the <HI>Campo Martio,</HI> called <HI>Piazza di Sciarra,</HI> erected a hollow Columne with winding stairs, and 56. Case∣ments to give Light within to them: being 175 foot high, some say it is raised with 28 stones only, but in this tis not so clearly discerna∣ble as in that of <HI>Trajano,</HI> for that the stayers being broke tis not a∣scendable. On the superficies of it are wrought the Acts of <HI>Antoninus</HI> with excellent sculpture of figures, from this, that place is deno∣minated <HI>Piazza Colonna.</HI></P>
<P>Those eleaven high Pillars, which are seen erected at the Church of Saint <HI>Stephano,</HI> in <HI>Truglio,</HI> are the reliques of that open Gallery which <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> built conjoyned, to his Palace in his Court: as far distant from this Church as the <HI>Rotonda.</HI></P>
<P>Between the Collumne of <HI>Antoninus</HI> and the Fountain of <HI>Acque Virgine,</HI> were the <HI>Septa</HI> of the <HI>Campo Martio,</HI> so called for that they were enclosed with several thick Plancks, in which the <HI>Roman</HI> People assembled when they gave their suffrages for Election of the Magi∣strates. They were also called <HI>Ovili</HI> for their similitude to a Sheepfold here the <HI>Roman</HI> Tribes assembled in Council.</P>
<P>That Hill, between <HI>San Lorenzo</HI> in <HI>Colonna,</HI> and the abovenamed Column, called <HI>Monte Acitorio:</HI> took its name from the Latine words <HI>Mons Citatorum,</HI> where every Tribe <HI>Se'paratim,</HI> rendred themselvs after they had given their suffrages in the <HI>Septa.</HI> On the same Hill stood a publique Palace, for receipt of Embassadors from Enemies who were not licen ced to enter the City nor dwell in <HI>Graecostasi,</HI> which lay between the Counsel and the <HI>Rostri,</HI> in the <HI>Piazza Roma∣na,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Santa Severina</HI> so much spoken of by the Hereticks, a man of great prudence, and an example for posterity, erected his Pa∣lace on this Hill.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is the Fountain of <HI>Aque Virgine,</HI> conveighed by a loud depressed Aqueduct over the <HI>Porta Collina,</HI> the Hill <HI>Santa Trinita,</HI> and through the <HI>Campo Martio</HI> now called <HI>Fontana di Trevi,</HI> we read in the inscription that <HI>Nieolo</HI> the 5th. restored it. And this alone of all the waters (which with so great costs, and such sumptuous
<PB N="215" REF="122"/>
Aqueducts, the antient Princes brought into <HI>Rome</HI>) remains standing for the publique Benefit.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> or <HI>Septa</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> people began the <HI>Stra∣da coperta,</HI> wherein stood heretofore a Temple of <HI>Neptune</HI> and the Am∣phitheatre of <HI>Claudius</HI> now wholly destroyed.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Acque Virgine</HI> was a Temple dedicated to <HI>Giuturna</HI> Sister of <HI>Tur no</HI> King of the <HI>Rutoli,</HI> accounted one of the <HI>Napee</HI> or Nimphes keep∣in gamong flowers, and the Countrey goddess, who as the Heathens believed assisted to the fertility of the Earth.</P>
<P>In the house of <HI>Angelio Colorio da Giesi,</HI> now appertaining to the <HI>Ru∣fali,</HI> are seen many statues, and inscriptions, and one Arch of the stone <HI>Tivoli,</HI> joyning to the <HI>Acque Virgine,</HI> having this Inscription. <HI>T.

<P>The Church <HI>Santa Trinita,</HI> now occupied by the Minime Fryars, was built by <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIth. King of <HI>France,</HI> wherein are some Tombes of Cardinals, as of <HI>Antonio Moreto,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>di Capri.</HI></P>
<P>At the <HI>Porta Collina</HI> near <HI>Santa Susanna, Salustius</HI> (as aforesaid) had most pleasant gardens, and a splendid dwelling, whose ruines yet appear in the Vale leading to <HI>Salara:</HI> Here stood an Obelisk (now translated elsewhere) sacred to the Moon, engraven with <HI>AEgyptian</HI> Hyeroglyphicks. The place is yet vulgarly called <HI>Salostrico.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Campo Scelerato,</HI> or the <HI>Via Scelerata</HI> (where the deflowred Vestal Virgines were buried alive) compleated all that space, from
<PB N="216" REF="123"/>
the <HI>Porta Collina</HI> under the house and gardens of <HI>Salustius</HI> to the <HI>Por∣ta Salaria.</HI></P>
<P>Without the <HI>Porta Salaria,</HI> called also <HI>Quirinale Collina</HI> and <HI>Ago∣nale</HI> lye the ruines of the Temple of <HI>Venus Erycina,</HI> whose Feast was ce∣lebrated with solemn ceremonies by chast Matrons, in the month of <HI>August,</HI> to the Image of <HI>Venus Ver ecordia,</HI> which Goddess was sup∣posed to render the Husbands placable and benevolent to their wives: in this Temple they likewise celebrated the <HI>Agonalian</HI> games, whence twas named <HI>Agonale.</HI></P>
<P>Three miles without the City over the <HI>Aniene,</HI> stands an entire Bridge, which a long inscription shews to have been built by <HI>Narse∣tes,</HI> tis said that <HI>Hannibal</HI> being on this Bridge vexed with a vehe∣ment rain, raised the siege of <HI>Rome,</HI> removed his Camp and depar∣ted.</P>
<P>A little below which, the <HI>Tyber</HI> commixeth with the River <HI>Aniene,</HI> and here <HI>Torquatus</HI> overcame that <HI>French Gyant;</HI> from whose neck he took that golden neck chain, which (because in Latine called <HI>Tor∣ques</HI>) gave him the surname of <HI>Torquatus.</HI> Tis worth observation, That the Water drawn out of the <HI>Tyber,</HI> above the City towards the Sea, maintains it self wholesome, and clean for many yeers, which comes to pass from the mixture of the River <HI>Aniene</HI> with the <HI>Tyber,</HI> The water of the <HI>Aniene</HI> being thick and polluted with <HI>Nitre,</HI> which preserves it and occasions that it cannot putrify without difficulty: and the inhabitants along the <HI>Tybers</HI> banks above where the <HI>Aniene</HI> commixeth with the <HI>Tyber,</HI> mingle the waters of the one with the o∣ther, that they may last sweet a long time: although they have been necessitated to take them up singly and separately. In the gravel of the <HI>Aniene,</HI> they find several little stones in divers forms after the similitude of <HI>Comfits,</HI> some round some long, some little and some great, so that one would believe they found Almonds, Fennel, An∣niseed, Coriander, and Cinamon Comfits. Of which small stones they usually gather a good heap on the bankside, to cousen the spe∣ctators with, and they are therefore called <HI>Confetti di Tivoli.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Titus Celius</HI> the <HI>Patrician</HI> recounts, that in former times a body of a man who was slain and cast into the <HI>Aniene,</HI> was found stuck fast to the root of a Tree under water, which it happened, in process of time, (being without putrefaction) was converted into stone, with∣out loosing its shape: which stony body so found he saies he saw with his proper eyes.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Porta Salaria</HI> are shewed the Reliques of an antique Tem∣ple, consecrated to Honour, and of the house <HI>Suburbano</HI> of <HI>Nero,</HI> where∣in by the assistance of <HI>Sporo</HI> the <HI>Libertine,</HI> the Emperor <HI>Nero</HI> thrust a dagger under his nipple, and therewith slew himself, that he might not fall into the hands of the Senate, then requiring him to punish∣ment.</P>
<P>Within the City near the Vale between the hills <HI>Santa Trinita,</HI> and <HI>Quirinale</HI> stands the Church <HI>San Nicolo de Archemontis,</HI> so named for that the <HI>Foro</HI> or <HI>Piazza,</HI> of <HI>Archemorio</HI> was in that place.</P>
<P>Under the Vineyard of the late Cardinal <HI>Dapi</HI> are certain Cham∣bers and obscure vaults continued in a long Order: which some will have to have been a Tavern, others had rather assign them to the use of the strumpets for their occupation in the time of the <HI>Floralian</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="123"/>
games: which were celebrated in the <HI>Circo Florae.</HI></P>
<P>At the Church <HI>de'dodeci Apostoli,</HI> you find a Lyon in Marble, an in∣comparable piece, and in the house of <HI>Colonna,</HI> a Marble statue of <HI>Melisse</HI> a Lady, as the inscription declares.</P>
<P>Many other Palaces and houses of the Cardinals, Nobles, and wealthy Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> are plentifully fraught with other Anti∣quities and excellent Collections of Gold, Silver, and Brass coynes embossed works in divers Metals of ingenious Artists. <HI>Onyexes, Cor∣neols,</HI> or <HI>Sardonian</HI> Gemmes, <HI>Cornelians, Amethists, Topazes, Berryls, Carbuncles, Jacinths, Saphirs,</HI> and <HI>Christals</HI> ingraven and cut with the heads of Gods, Emperors, illustrious and noble Men, divers Crea∣tures, Hearbs, and Trees, containing also divers emblemes, which were heretofore commonly exposed to the view of strangers by their Patrones: but of later yeers the malignity of this depraved Age hath so ill gratified those persons for their Kindness, by many injuries received from such their free admission, that now unless re∣commended by some friend to some particular person in <HI>Rome,</HI> or contracting a Friendship through long familiarity: tis not easie for a stranger to obtain an inspection of those pretious Curiosi∣ties.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Cemeterio Ostriano,</HI> three miles without the City in the <HI>Via Salaria,</HI> is thought to be the most antient of <HI>Rome,</HI> for that Saint <HI>Peter</HI> the Apostle in that place administred the Sacrament of Bap∣tism.</P>
<P>The <HI>Protonotario</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church in his third Chapter of the Acts of Pope <HI>Liberio,</HI> speaks of it in this manner. A little distant from the <HI>Cemetrio di Novella,</HI> three miles without the City lay in the <HI>Via Salaria,</HI> the <HI>Cemiterio Ostriano,</HI> where the Apostle Saint <HI>Peter</HI> Bapti∣zed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cemiterio Vaticano</HI> was placed on the <HI>Via Trionfale</HI> near the Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the Circ of <HI>Nero,</HI> in the Gardens of <HI>Nero</HI> where now the Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> stands: which besides the Tombs of Christians had in it also a Font for holy Baptisme, which for the most part was not in others.</P>
<P>Seaven miles distant from <HI>Rome</HI> was the <HI>Cemiterio</HI> called <HI>ad Nim∣phas,</HI> in <HI>Severus</HI> his possession on the <HI>Via Nomentana,</HI> where the holy Martyres bodies were enterred. As Pope <HI>Alexanders, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Two miles without the City was the <HI>Cemeterio vecchio,</HI> amplified by the <HI>B. Calistus</HI> the Pope, from whom also it took a name. Herein were certain <HI>subterranean</HI> places called <HI>Catacombe,</HI> and in them a deep Pit, wherein the bodies of the Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> were layed.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library of the Pope.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Vatican</HI> Library of the Pope is every day frequented by lear∣ned Men, and meritoriously for that it is filled with the most antient books in all the Professions, as well Greek, Latine, and He∣brew as other Languages writtten with the pen in Parchment And tis certainly to be admired, that those Popes under so many disgraces, negociations, Foreign and civil Wars and sackings of Rome, should still apply their chiefest study and pain in heaping to∣gether Books, and preserving those collections.</P>
<P><HI>Sixtus</HI> the 5th in our time beautified and aggrandized it wonder∣fully adjoining to it a noble Fabrick, and causing most excellent pi∣ctures to be drawn about it: Which <HI>Guglielmo Bianco</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Man praiseth in a singular Poem: and Fryer <HI>Angelo Rocca</HI> by way of Histo∣ry treates of it diffusely. As also <HI>Onofrio Panuino</HI> of the same Or∣der.</P>
<P>Many great Scholars have only desired favour from the Pope as to publish an Index of the Greek and Latine Books extant in that Library, that by this means recourse might be had to <HI>Rome</HI> from all parts both for the enlightning and correcting Authors, who have been altogether unseen, or are els printed full of errors. This the noble City <HI>Augusta</HI> permitted, and by that publique Index set forth in vited all to go thither for comparing the uncorrected for their a∣mendment. How many bookes have <HI>Francis</HI> the first and <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the second Kings of <HI>France</HI> sent forth to light. How many benefits have the Republique of Scholars had from the Grand Duke of <HI>Tusca∣nies</HI> Bibliotheque: and how much more advantage would all the world receive from such an Index of the Pontifical Library, which is of splendidly royal.</P>
<P>Other Libraries there are also in <HI>Rome,</HI> as that of the Capitol. That which appertained to the Cardinal <HI>Sirleto</HI> now to Cardinal <HI>Colonna,</HI> valeued at 20000. Crownes: That of the Family of <HI>Sforza,</HI> and that of the <HI>Farnesi,</HI> abounding with Greek Authors.</P>
<P>We pass by many Libraries of private persons no less replenished with rare Books as that of <HI>Fulvio Orsino.</HI> That of <HI>Aldo Manutio</HI> (who passed to a better life at green yeers) consisting of 80▪ thousand Books. We must observe though▪ that <HI>Fulvio Orsino</HI> in the yeer 1600. added his to the Library of the Pope. And that <HI>Ascanio Colonna</HI> (never e∣nough
<PB N="222" REF="126"/>
to be praised) bought that of <HI>Sirleto</HI> for 14 thousand Crownes deputing to it intelligent Keepers with honest stipends, that it may ra∣ther dayly increase, then at all diminish.</P>
<P>The great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> his noble Library is known to have good numbers of Greek Books, and that of <HI>Urbino,</HI> of Mathemati∣cal Writers. That of the <HI>Malatesti</HI> is in <HI>Cesena</HI> in the <HI>Minorites</HI> Con∣vent. In <HI>Bologna</HI> that of the preaching Fathers. In <HI>Venice</HI> that of the Republique. In <HI>Padoua</HI> is that of <HI>Gio Vicenzo Pinello</HI> famous enough: but lets return to the <HI>Libraria Vaticana.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certainly concluded that the Gentiles usually preserved their Books in the publique Libraries as well as private, &amp; tis no less evident that the Catholick Church from Christs time to ours had alwaies in divers places sacred Libraries to advantage students: wherefore St. <HI>Augustine</HI> in the Narration which he makes, <HI>De persecutione Arrianorum in Ecclesia Alexandrina</HI> saies, that in the Christian Churches there were Libraries, and that with the greatest care they preserved their Books: and accuseth the impiety of the <HI>Arrians</HI> amongst other things for their taking away and burning the Books of the Church. Saint <HI>Jerome</HI> like∣wise makes mention of the same Libraries. when writing to <HI>Pama∣chius</HI> by his Books against <HI>Jovinianus</HI> he saies that he kept in the Chur∣ches Libraries <HI>Eusebius</HI> also in his 119 Book at the 11 Chapter writeth, that the Church had holy Books in the Oratories, and that in <HI>Dio∣clesians</HI> dayes, (to the end the name of Christian might be wholly ex∣tinguished) the Oratories were overthrowen, and the books burnt nor does there want conjectures hereof from the holy Scripture for that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> writing to <HI>Timothy,</HI> commands him to transport with himself his Books to <HI>Rome,</HI> chiefly those in parchment: and in the first to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> he testifies that in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Churches, they used to read the Prophetick books. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his 5 book of the Ec∣clesiastical history at the 10th. Chapter saies, that the Apostle Saint <HI>Eartholomew</HI> going to prea ch the gospel to the <HI>Indians,</HI> left there the Gospel of Saint <HI>Matthew</HI> writ by his own hand: Which very copy, <HI>Origene</HI> afterwards found in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and from thence carryed it (as Saint <HI>Jerome</HI> averrs) to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> when he also brought from the East the Canonical books of the old Testament. Lastly the He∣brews diligently conserved their sacred books, and on every Sab∣bath read the Books of <HI>Moses</HI> in their Synagogues wherefore tis reaso∣nable enough to believe, that the Christians have alwaies observed their rule, of diligently copying and preserving the prophetick books those of the Apostles and those of the Evangelists: But the places where these books were layed up, were not alwaies called by the same name, but sometimes <HI>Archiviunt</HI> a Treasury of <HI>Rolls, scrinium</HI> a Coffer where evidences were kept, <HI>Bibliotheca</HI> or <HI>Libraria</HI> a Biblio∣theque or Library as in se veral Authors appears.</P>
<P>Then indubitably they used to lay up in places deputed to that purpose the Memorials of greatest importance, the Books of the Bi∣ble of the old and new Testament, and the Books of the holy Fathers; many whereof written by their own Authors through this means have reached our times, and will continue to future Ages if God soplease,</P>
<P>And because the collecting and conserving those books, required a great expence as well in writers, as Inquisitors, and conserva∣tors, therefore the richest Christians cōmonly contributed every one
<PB N="223" REF="126"/>
some proportion and part, as a common stock for the Church to have the same effected.</P>
<P>And in particular we have great obligation to the Emperor <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> the Great, who (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> recounts in his third Book of his life) without regard to the vast expence, made it his business to col∣lect and secure the sacred Books, which in the times of the persecu∣tions the Gentiles had wholy dispersed.</P>
<P>After which the gathering, keeping, and choosing Books, was par∣ticularly the charge of the Bishops and Priests, for which end they were wont to maintain Notaries, Stationers, and Women exercised and skilled in writing, as may be gathered from the life of <HI>Ambrosi∣us</HI> and of <HI>Origene.</HI> Among all other Collectors of Books <HI>Pantenius</HI> the Master of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> School is esteemed the most diligent: like∣wise <HI>Pamfilo</HI> the Priest and Martyr (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> relates) instituted and governed with great industry a fair Library, placing there the Books of <HI>Origene</HI> and such other good Books as he could get written by the hand: of which <HI>Caesarean</HI> Library St. <HI>Jerom</HI> against <HI>Rufinus</HI> takes notice. Furthermore <HI>Alexander</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> got together a good quantity of Books, as of <HI>Betillus, Hippolitus, Caius</HI> and other Ecclesiasti∣cal writers, and with them composed a worthy Library, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> testifies, who also confesseth himself to have been assisted by the said <HI>Alexander</HI> in his own Ecclesiastical History.</P>
<P>And not to omit the diligence of some of later times in the like work, lets remember, that Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the first, successor to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who wrote many Epistles profitable to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, de∣puted seaven Scriveners in the seaven praecincts of <HI>Rome,</HI> who were maintained out of the Churches Revenne for no other thing then di∣ligently to search out and write the Acts of the martyrs. And <HI>Ani∣cetus</HI> the Pope made it his business to find out a secure place for the laying up the lives of the Martyrs wrote by those Scriveners. Pope <HI>Fabianus</HI> ordained seaven Deacons, for supervisors to those Nota∣ries, to take the better care in executing the charge of collecting and true recital of the Martirs lives: Of which Scriveners the Actions of the <HI>Roman</HI> Councel under <HI>Silvester,</HI> give good testimony Pope <HI>Ju∣lius</HI> successor to <HI>Marcus</HI> who followed <HI>Sil.</HI> determined that the said No∣taries abovenamed should diligently gather together, whatever ap∣pertained to the amplifying, and fortifiing of the holy Catholick Faith, &amp; that all the things by them writ should be revised by the <HI>Pri∣micerio,</HI> or chief, created to that purpose, who afterwards was to place and keep in the Church what he had approved.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Hilary</HI> was the first (known) that built a Library, who erect∣ed two near, the Founts of the <HI>Laterano,</HI> wherein (for that in those times there were but few Books, and they at great price because wholly written by the hand) he caused the writings of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, the decretal Epistles of Popes, the Actions of the Counsels, the recantations and opinions of the Hereticks, and the Books of the holy Fathers, to be layed up and preserved for the publique use of the Christians.</P>
<P>But to return to our purpose of the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library: we must know that beside the abovenamed Libraries, the Popes used so great dili∣gence in collecting books, as they put together one greater than the two former in the Popes Palace on the <HI>Laterano,</HI> which remained
<PB N="224" REF="127"/>
there about one thousand yeers, till <HI>Clement</HI> the 5th. translating the Apostolick Sea into <HI>France,</HI> with it carryed the said Library in the <HI>Laterano</HI> to <HI>Avignon</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which continued there about 120 yeers, till the difference was appeased between the Catholicks▪ Pope <HI>Martin</HI> the 5th. caused the said Library to be reconveyed to <HI>Rome,</HI> placing it in the <HI>Vatican,</HI> where his <HI>S.</HI> had then chosen and setled his Residence: where they were disposed confusedly without any order, and a good part lost. Whereto <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 4th. having regard, &amp; it appearing to him insupportable, that so great a quantity of books should go to ruine through ill government, he built a place on pur∣pose for them adorning it by all possible means, placing them me∣thodically, and adding such other Books as he could come by, and or∣dered the Officers deputed to that end, to govern them with dili∣gence, endowing it with a hundred Crowns a yeer in perpetuity, being the donative which the Colledge of writers of the Pontifical Letters was used to make the Popes yeerly, and this was bestowed on the Library Keepers for their diligence and pains. This then is the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library, filled with the most choise Books that could be had a great part written in parchment with the pen: others printed: and their number exceeds six thousand books.</P>
<P>Antiently the President of this Library was called <HI>Librario,</HI> then <HI>Cancellario,</HI> whose office was to collect with diligence not only the Books, but also to copy the Bulls, the Popes decrees, the Acts and Con∣stitutions of the Synods, and to keep every thing exactly, because it appeared convenient, that the <HI>Cancellario</HI> or as he is now called the Secretary of the Pope, should have the managing and preserving of the Books, the Library being in those dayes as twere the Office of the Secretary or Chancery: but in our times the Offices of the Chancery and of the Library are divided.</P>
<P>They used to elect Men of the greatest knowledge and of good life for Presidents of the Library as <HI>Anastasius</HI> in the Life of Pope <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> the second relates, which <HI>Gregory</HI> he saies was first President there who being sent to <HI>Constantinople</HI> by Pope <HI>Constantine</HI> to the Empe∣ror <HI>Justinian</HI> the second, and being questioned by him he answered learnedly: and the Bibliothecary in the life of the said <HI>Gregory</HI> the second saies that he was from a boy brought up in the <HI>Lateranian</HI> pa∣lace, and being made Deacon by Pope <HI>Sergius</HI> took upon him the charge of the Library. at last <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 4th. on the 10 day of <HI>July</HI> 1475. being the sixth of his Papacy, created a perpetual Keeper to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library investing him in that Office by his Bull.</P>
<P><HI>Bartolomeo Platina</HI> of <HI>Cremona</HI> the Apostolick writer, and familiar of <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth was the first president to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library, for which service he had 10 Crowns <HI>per</HI> Month for his maintenance, be∣sides provision for his own Table with 3 servants and one horse, and the ordinary Vails, which the popes usually allowed to their Famili∣ants, as Wood, Salt, Oyl, Vinegar, Candles, Brooms, and other the like things.</P>
<P><HI>Bartolomeo Manfredo</HI> a <HI>Bolonian</HI> Doctor of the Canons was by <HI>Six∣tus</HI> the 4th. <HI>annno.</HI> 1481: in the 11th of his Popedome elected to that Charge in lieu of the deceased <HI>Platina.</HI> This <HI>Manfredo</HI> was a Fami∣liar acquaintance of the Popes, and wonderfully learned. And to add splendor to this Office the Pope ordained that the Presidents of the

Library for the future should be the first Squires of the Roman Popes for ever, and should receive the accustomed honors and profits: first giving security to the Apostolick Chamber of ten thousand Duckats, and taking an Oath to keep faithfully and diligently the Library.

He would not accept the stipend, nor the four sportule or Fees usually given to the Presidents of the Library but distributed those emoluments to the two Latin Correctors, and to him whose charge was to find out and place the Books.</P>
<P><HI>Roberto de Nobili</HI> of <HI>Monte Pulciano</HI> Dean Cardinal, with the Title of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> in <HI>Dominica</HI> was created by <HI>Paul</HI> the fourth <HI>anno</HI> 1555.</P>

<P>And because twas imposible for one single person to give suffici∣ent attendance to the government of so many Books the same <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth gave to the President of the Library, two other perpe∣tual Keepers, persons of good Faith, and diligence to assist in that charge, allowing to each 3 crowns salary <HI>per</HI> Moneth, and his Dyet, and the other abovenamed perqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>its, as also for one servant.

This pope the 23d of <HI>August</HI> in the first yeer of of his Popedome granted a Load of Charcoals weekly to the said Keepers, but now for the whole yeer is allowed but 24 Load only: In the yeer 1535. <HI>Fausto Sabeo</HI> a <HI>Brescian</HI> Poet and <HI>Nicolo Magio∣rano Hidronteno</HI> succeeded these, the latter of whom being created Bi∣shop of <HI>Mancpoli</HI> him succeeded <HI>Guglielmo Sirleto,</HI> and him his Bro∣ther <HI>Girolamo Sirleto, Federigo Ronaldo Valnease</HI> being created pro∣thonotary followed <HI>Sabeo,</HI> and <HI>Marin Ronaldo</HI> Brother of the said <HI>Fe∣derigo</HI> succeeded to <HI>Girolamo Sirleto.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore the same <HI>Sixtus</HI> (that nothing might be wanting to the compleating the splendor of the pontifical Library) created three with the denomination of exquisite writers, the one in Greek a second in Latin, a third in Hebrew, with their Dyet, and four crowns a moneth, but <HI>Paulus</HI> the fourth doubled the greek Salary and added two other Greek writers, and one Latin, to the one of which Greek writers and to the Latin he assigned five Crowns by the Moneth, and two Sportule, which is a certain Fee payed to the Pope or Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> by every person that got the better in any suite in Law, but to the other Greek he assigned two <HI>Sportule</HI> and four Crowns only.

<P>Lastly <HI>Marcello Corvino.</HI> President of the Library instituted two Correctors and Revisors of the Latin Books, between whom he divi∣ded the benefits accruing to the Presidents denying to retain them to himself as aforetold, and gave two sportule to each, being the four due to himself as president, assigning a Salary of five Crowns to the one and four to the other and the tenth Crown which remained to him of the ten crowne by the Moneth assigned to the presidents he deputed that for him whom <HI>Paul</HI> the 4th had instituted for sweeper, to whom the regalies were not granted.

<HEAD>Of the Ceremony in kissing the feet of the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CHAP. XI. Taken out of <HI>GIOSEFFO STEPHANO</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>ORIOLANO.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Wherein is shewed, that for good reasons the <HI>Pope</HI> wears a Cross upon his Shoe or Slipper, and the <HI>Chri∣stian People</HI> kiss his Feet.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMong the many things the Popes had given them to bear and carry for ensignes of Glory and dignity by the Emperor <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> the Great, with which for long time together they have gone adorned, ware a pair of Slippers made of the whitest linnen cloth for the Ornament of their Feet. (which Slippers we may name Pumpes for their being so apted to the Feet) whereof we read an e∣special memorial in the Acts of <HI>San Silvestre,</HI> for that the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI> commanded that the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> should cloth their Feet with the purest Linnen, in imitation of the high Priests and an∣tient Prophets, who we read in the fifth Book of <HI>Herodian</HI> were thus vested. And tis most certain, that the Sandals or slippers of the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop are alwaies bedecked with some singular Ornament, differing from those which ordinary Bishops wear at the celebration of their Mass, otherwise how could the blessed <HI>Antidius</HI> near <HI>Segeberto</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 418 distinguish the Pope by the slippers he had on, nor could that have happened, if those of the Pope had not had a peculiar Mark differing from those of the Bishops. <HI>San Bernardo</HI> in his forty second Epistle declares that the slippers are a part of those Ensignes which the Popes are obliged to wear at the solemnizing of Mass.</P>
<P>The same thing also is averred by <HI>Innocenzo</HI> III. in his first Book <HI>de Divinis Officiis,</HI> in the 24th Chapter. <HI>Ivo Cornatense,</HI> in the 76th. Epistle, and in his speech <HI>de significatione Indumentorum. Rabano</HI> in his first Book the 22d. Chapter <HI>Durando</HI> in his third Book the 28th. Chapter and many others.</P>
<P>And although rhe <HI>Roman</HI> High Priests antiently used this sort of Shooing with the whitest Linnen, we must nevertheless, confess, that now the Custome is changed, and in lieu thereof are worne a cer∣tain red sort of shooing, with a cross wrought on them the occasion of which mutation may be attributed partly to the reverence of the People, and partly to the consideration of the Popes Person.</P>
<P>Wherein will be manifested the humility of the Pope, who knowing all Persons prone to the kissing of his Feet, desired to have the sign
<PB N="228" REF="129"/>
of the Cross fixed thereon, to the end that so much honour might be payed to the most holy sign of the Cross rather than to his own pro∣per person: And that his Holiness would also reduce into the minds of the faithfull which kiss his feet, the passion and death of our Savi∣our. With great Judgment then, most honest intention and good end, have they introduced this wearing the signe of the Cross upon the popes Sandals, since that the kissing of the cross is an Act of the Reverence born to it, used in the most holy Church antiently, whose custom it was in that manner to reverence not only the holy Crosse, but also the holy Images of Christ and of the Saints, the Visage and heads of which Images the faithfull of old accustomed to approach, in token of respect and honour, as <HI>Niceforus</HI> in his seaventeenth Book the 25th. Chapter recounts, and <HI>Zonara</HI> in the third tome of the Life of <HI>Theodofilo.</HI></P>
<P>The sublime Ensigne of the <HI>Romans</HI> made in manner of the Cross of the Saviour, which was wont to be born before <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperor, and was adored by the Senate and the Souldiery, is called <HI>Laboria,</HI> perchance for that in Latine it signifies Labour, to wit for that that blessed Ensigne put the Souldiers in good heart and re∣membrance, when they were near toyled with fighting, or for that they bore up that Ensign when they marched, or els for that they mustred the Souldiers under that Banner to signifie to them the pains they must take under it, as <HI>Paolo Diacono,</HI> relates in the 11th. of his History, and <HI>Nicolo Prinio</HI> in the consults of the <HI>Burgari,</HI> at the 7th. Chap and 23. <HI>Paolino Nolano</HI> demonstrates very clearly in the 42d. E∣pistle, the Custome, which was, that the princes and great Lords kis∣sed the Cross, submitting to it all the Banners of their glory, and worldly Majesty.</P>
<P>Nor have they born this Reverence to the Cross alone, but also to all the Instruments of the Passion of our Lord, as <HI>Sant Ambrosius</HI> in a discourse he makes of the death of <HI>Theodosius,</HI> averreth, touching one of the Nayls which was pierced through the Feet of our Saviour. To come then to the other Head, wherefore we judge it convenient the change of the white slippers or sandals, for slippers or sandals with the Cross wrought on them; we say that herein the Popes have endeavoured to demonstrate expresly the Image of the Aposto∣lick charge because they havinng received a charge to teach to all the world, and to preach the Gospel, have likewise adorned their feet with the signe of peace and of the Gospel▪ that so they may walk perfect through the World in vertue of the signe of the crosse. <HI>Isaiah</HI> the Prophet saith thus, Beautifull are the Feet of those who preach Peace, and publish good tidings, as if that forseeing this U∣sage, he should wonder, how the heads of the Christian People should find out so convenient an ornament to put up∣on their Feet, so that the Nations beholding them should not only remain full of gladnesse for the good newes which they had heard from them; but should also perceive a certain content for having seen them all beautifull, all adorned, and signalized to the very feet with the figure of the holy Cross. Because tis usual to weigh in qua∣lified persons, all their Actions, all their words, all their Vestments and habits to their very feet; and so the Bridegroom praising his Spouse in the <HI>Canticles,</HI> sets down as a great concern, that having
<PB N="229" REF="129"/>
fair shoes she walked graciously. <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his Book of the habits of women, puts a difference between <HI>Culto</HI> Neatness, and <HI>Ornamen∣to,</HI> Ornament, saying that neatness consists in the quality of the Vests as of Gold, Silver, and the like habiliments, but that Ornament con∣sists in the disposition of the parts of that body which wears it. Then the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishops, who rconcile and make Peace by way of their Letters and Ministers to all Nations to the great astonishment of all, have obtained and pursued the one and the other of the aforenamed parts, that is to say Neatness and Ornament.</P>
<P>Furthermore the sign of the Cross is made on the forehead and Breasts of the faithfull, to the end that as <HI>Augustine</HI> saith upon the 30th <HI>Psalm,</HI> they may not fear to confess the faith, and having over∣come the Devil, they may carry the Banner of their Victory in their forehead, therefore also is the same signe worne upon the feet of the Pope, that he by that sign may be directed in that good way through which he is to lead all the People of God, thereby to shew unto the Pope, that to him was given this holy priviledge to be our guide by means of the Cross: wherein (saith Saint <HI>Austin</HI> in the 10th Sermon <HI>de Sanctis Tom</HI> 10) are contained all the Mysteries and all the Sacra∣ments, he fortifies (as we may say) his feet with the Cross, to the end that he shewing the way and we walking in it, none may wander from good thoughts. It may also be said that the Pope bears a Cross upon his feet, that in all persecutions and dangers all his people may recur securely to his Feet, where remedy may be had to overcome the difficulties, and doctrine to oppresse heresies if need require, as tis written in <HI>Deutronomy</HI> at the 33d. Chapter, <HI>Qui appropinquat pe∣dibus accepit de doctrina ejus.</HI> Weighing all which considerations, with their foundation in the passion of Christ, very rationally have the Popes placed this signe upon their feet, to evidence these mysterious significations. Which is so antient and firm, that in the old Ima∣ges we see no Pope drawn or carved who hath not also the cross up∣on his Feet: from which considerations it appears manifestly, that the perverse and wicked Hereticks of our times are in a great error, for expressing their dislike of the Popes wearing a Cross upon his feet, saying that tis an undervaluation and want of due reverence payed to the Cross.</P>
<P>For answer whereunto by their favour: Is it not true (that as <HI>Cirillus</HI> in 3. <HI>Tomo contra Julianum</HI> saies) the old usage was to paint Crosses on the entrances into houses, and that (as <HI>Nazianzenus</HI> in his oration against the same saies) on the garments of the Souldiers were signed Crosses come from heaven, and that the Church to succor dying persons with spiritual help, used to mark their feet with the signe of the Cross, and that twas usual to mark the bodies of beasts with the Cross, as saies <HI>Sainctus Severus de Morbibus bono:</HI> and <HI>San Chrysostome,</HI> in his demonstration <HI>Quod Deus sit homo.</HI> Did they not mark the houses, the publick places, the Vests, the Armories, and fi∣nally divers other usual things with the Cross, as <HI>Leoncio Cipriottio</HI> a∣gainst the Jews declares, to the end that in every place and in eve∣ry action, we may rub up our drowsie memories with the passion of Christ our Lord: And shall we afterwards say, that it expresseth lit∣tle reverence to the Cross in placing it upon the feet of Christs Vi∣car, by which we not only are minded of the passion of our Saviour
<PB N="230" REF="130"/>
when we behold it, but intend that thereby is signified, that we ought not alone to submit to the Cross, and tread down all worldly passi∣ons, which to the purpose are expressed in Scripture with the name of feet, but also for the Love of the passion of Christ to esteem at nought what ever happens under the Moon. The which cannot be so well signified, by placing the Cross in any other places but on the Feet of the Pope, to kiss which all the faithfull strivingly run toge∣ther.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Reason wherefore they carry his Holiness upon Mens Shoulders</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TIs not from the purpose to say somewhat of the Lifting up of the Pope, since that all old Authors when they speak of the Creation of any King or Emperour, say that he was elevated and it may be that <HI>Claudianus</HI> speaks to this sense.
<Q>Sed mox cum solita miles te voce levasset.</Q></P>
<P>Nor was this the custom of the Barbarous Nations only, but even of the Romans themselves who having chosen any One for their Em∣peror, lifted him on high, and carryed him upon their Shoulders: so saies <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> in his 22 book speaking of <HI>Julianus</HI> made Emperor by the Souldiers of <HI>France;</HI> so sets forth <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> in his 20 book and the same likewise speaks <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> of the Goths in his 20th Book <HI>Variacum Epist.</HI> 31. This custom <HI>Adon</HI> of <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> manifests in the sons of <HI>Clotharus: Julianus Capitolinus</HI> speaking of the <HI>Giordani:</HI> and <HI>Herodian</HI> in his seventh book treating of the same. In which time, they did not only exalt the <HI>Roman</HI> Princes as aforesaid, and Princes of other Nations, but likewise the praefects of the City whom to honour the more they usually drew up and down the streets in a <HI>Caroach</HI> with an officer going be∣fore, who proclaimed, that the praefect came; and this is clearly de∣monstrated by <HI>Siniachus</HI> in his first book &amp; <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> in his 6th. from 24. But the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishops who from God have chief authority over the eternal way, for demonstration of their dignity, were wont to be conveighed through the City in a certain Chariot, honestly, or meanly clothed, as <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> in his 27th book avers in his conceipt of <HI>Damascus</HI> and <HI>Urcisinus</HI> to this point in that time when <HI>Pretestatus</HI> put on the <HI>Pretesta</HI> (which was a Robe the chief Magistrate of <HI>Rome</HI> wore when they sate in Majesty) being then de∣signed Consul: he preposed the Bishoprick of the Christians to the Consulship of the <HI>Roman</HI> people, and was wont to say to <HI>San Damas∣cus</HI> the Pope (as <HI>San Girolamus</HI> also relates in his Epistle to <HI>Pammac∣chius</HI>)
<PB N="231" REF="130"/>
make me Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and I will soon make my self a Chri∣stian, from which words we may comprehend, that even in those daies the Pontifical dignity moved the minds of the principal and greatest persons being that the Consulacy was a dignity to which all others gave place, as in more Epistles <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> shews in the 10th. book and <HI>Protestatus</HI> so he might have been high Bishop of the Chri∣stians would not only have deserted his old false Religion, but also Consulship.</P>
<P>That it was the manner of the antient Priests to pass in Coaches for greater reputation, <HI>Tacitus</HI> in his 12th book clearly proves, who speaking of <HI>Agrippina,</HI> saies, That shee (to agrandize her repu∣tation this way) was drawn to the <HI>Campidoglio</HI> in a Caroach a thing then only permitted to the Priests and holy Druides for their digni∣ty. This custom was likewise used by the Virgins (as may be col∣lected from the first book of <HI>Artimedorus,</HI> his Positions) and chiefly of the Vestals, who were carryed in Litters, attended by many ser∣vants with great Pomp, as Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> relates in his first Epistle to <HI>Valentinian.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Romon</HI> Bishops, besides the Chariot and Coach wherein they publiquely passed through the City, had also a supportable Chair wherein being sate it was carryed upon the shoulders of Men depu∣ted to that service, and who lived upon that profession which is ma∣nifest enough, not only from that place of <HI>Duoaio,</HI> where he saies, that in the fifth Synod, was placed the Chair or Throne of the Apo∣stolick confession, but also more clearly from the most antient <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Order written before <HI>Gelasius</HI> the Popes time, wherein we finde expressions to this sence <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>When the Pope is entred into the Church, he does not instantly advance to the Altar, but first goes into the Vestry sustained by Dea∣cons, who received &amp; assisted him, while he descended from his Chair and to that effect the said Order several times relates the Ceremony of placing the Pope in the Chair, when he was to take any Journey and to sustain him by the Arms in descent from the Chair, being ar∣rived at the place where he resolved to stay.</P>
<P>In which words is also to be observed, that the said Order calls this Pontifical Chair in Latin <HI>Sellare,</HI> which properly signifies a Maje∣stick Throne made for dignity, it being a Chair wrought with Art and proportionable thereto.</P>
<P>As to the Popes being born up by hands, tis easily manifested, that he was so supported not only at his descent from the Chair, but also upon several other occasions when not at all in the Chair, which is proved by the examples of many Popes: As <HI>Stephen</HI> the second (saies <HI>Palatina,</HI> and <HI>Francesco Giovanetto</HI> in the 90th. Chapter was car∣ried upon shoulders in the Church of <HI>Constantine,</HI> and then in the <HI>La∣terano</HI> and <HI>Adrian</HI> the second was so born up in the <HI>Laterano</HI> by the Clergy and by the chief of the Nobility the Comunalty then contending with the Clergy and Nobility for that honourable Office, as appears in the descriptions the 63d. Chapter, which be∣gins. <HI>Cum Adrianus Secundus, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Gregory</HI> the ninth was so sustained in the <HI>Laterano,</HI> laded with Gemmes and Gold.</P>
<P>At which custome none ought to wonder, since so long before prophesied by <HI>Esaiah</HI> in the 49th Chapter be these words. <HI>Et ef∣ferent

filios tuos in Uluis &amp; filias super humeros portabunt,</HI> in our English Translation tis thus rendred.</P>
<P>And they shall bring thy Sons in their Arms, and thy Daughters shall be carryed upon their shoulders.</P>
<P>The occasion for which custome proceeds from the great reve∣rence wherewith the Princes of the World ought to observe the Presidents of the Church, which Princes ought not to omit any con∣venient honour due to the Church, and so consequently to the head thereof. It stands with good reason too, that the Pope should be born up on high, to the end that on the one side he may the better see and bestow his Benediction on the People comitted to him, and that the People may on the other side behold their Head, acknow∣ledging him for Gods Vicar, and thence fortifie themselves in the confession of the Catholick Faith.</P>

<HEAD>The same <HI>PIGHIO</HI> speaks of the Coronation of the Pope in this sence.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Princes for demonstration of the Majesty of Empire have worn a golden Crown. <HI>David</HI> who reigned before <HI>Homer</HI> and before all the antient writers at this day extant, had such a Crown as is proved in the 12th. Chapter of the second Book of Kings, the which he took to himself from one of the Cities of the <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>onites</HI> by him overcome in warr, which who desires may read in the words of the cited Text. <HI>Ciassare</HI> King of the <HI>Medes</HI> (as saies <HI>Zonara,</HI> in the first Tome) sent a certain beautifull Daughter of his own to <HI>Cyrus</HI> with a golden Crown upon her head, and with the whole province of <HI>Media</HI> for Dowry. The <HI>Romans</HI> triumphing carryed a Crown of Gold, as <HI>Golliote</HI> relates, which might seem improperly and erro∣neously declared, in respect all historians write that the Emperors Triumphing were crowned with Lawrel, if <HI>Tertullian</HI> did not re∣move this doubt in his Tract entituled <HI>De Corona Militis,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> in his 21st. Book the third Chapter saies, that the Radiant Crowns were composed with Leaves of Gold and silver. <HI>Zonara</HI> in the se∣cond Tome describing the Pompe of a Triumph saies: that while triumphing they carryed two Crowns, one was placed on the head of the Emperor, which was of Lawrel, the other which was of Gold and enterwoven with pretious stones, was born up over the head of the Emperour by the hands of a publique Minister, who stood upon the same Chariot whereof <HI>Juvenal</HI> speaks in the tenth Satyr, saying.
<Q><L>Tantum orbem, quanto cervix non sufficit ulla,</L>
<L>Quippe tenet sudans, hanc publicus, &amp; sibi Consul</L>
<L>Ne placeat, curru servus Portatur eodem.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="131"/>And <HI>Valerius Paterculus,</HI> saies that this Crown of Gold, was of the colour of a Rain-bow, to demonstrate the signe of a certain Divi∣nity, speaking of <HI>Augustus Caesar Octavins</HI> in his second Book. As al∣so of the same make clear mention, calling it <HI>Radiante,</HI> and <HI>Lucide, Suetoninus,</HI> in the life of <HI>Augustus</HI> the 44th Chapter. <HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Panegyrick,</HI> the unknown Author in the <HI>Panegyrick</HI> dedicated to <HI>Maximilianus</HI> and <HI>Latinus Peccatus</HI> in <HI>Panegyrick,</HI> whose words would take up too much room to set down here.</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> in the 17th. book treating of the sharp pointed Pyramids, saies that they were wont to place Crowns on the heads of statues: which he again confirms in the 24th Book, from which testimonies <HI>Lazius</HI> collects in his 9th Book of Commen∣taries of the <HI>Roman</HI> Republique, that our Predecessors derived the custome of placing on the heads of the Images of Saints in the Chur∣ches, Crowns figured in the form of the raies of the Sun, chiefly for that those images being adorned with such Crownes, seemed to have, I know not what kind of splendour and Divinity: which rea∣son, though it be not, altogether from the purpose, yet tis not al∣together to be, maintained: for that we rather think, that this u∣sage and custome had its original from that splendour which hath been often seen miraculously, to shine on the heads of the Saints: Being that (as <HI>Abdias</HI> in the 5th. Book, and <HI>Eusebius</HI> in the second of his Histories relate) the Apostles were often overshadowed with such a Light, as human eye could not behold them, as of old fell out to <HI>Moses,</HI> whose Face (when he had had that near conference with God) did shine so bright, that <HI>Aaron</HI> and the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> were afraid to come near him, as is recorded in the 34th Chapter of <HI>Exodus.</HI></P>
<P>To return then to our subject. The <HI>Persian</HI> Kings had a Crown to be worn on their heads which <HI>Zonara</HI> sets down in greek by its proper name, which can neither be commodiously ex∣pressed either in Latin or vulgar tongue: and it was a capital of∣fence among the <HI>Persians</HI> for any one to put the Kings Crown upon his head as <HI>Dion Chrysostomus</HI> denotes in his first oration <HI>De libertate &amp; servitute.</HI> Likewise the priests of the Gentiles wore a crown upon their heads, for demonstration of that repute which appertained to the splendidness and maintenance of their Sacerdotal office: whence the Antients were stupified, at a suddain view of the great Priest of the <HI>Comani,</HI> to whom (as <HI>Strabo</HI> writes) was granted the first ho∣nour next the King, and to wear a Royal Crown. Besides in <HI>Emesa</HI> a City of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> the Priests went clad with a long robe, having a Crown of pretious stones of various colours in token of Majesty upon their heads. Which Ornament <HI>Antoninus</HI> being made Empe∣ror of the <HI>Romans,</HI> by the multitude, the Souldiery and the Priests of the Sun, would not part with again, as <HI>Herodianus</HI> in <HI>libro quinto</HI> clear∣ly proves: and so afterwards the Emperors of <HI>Constantinople</HI> trium∣phing, elected this ornament, which was called by a proper name as we read in the life of <HI>Basilius Porfirogenitus. Triumphum duxit tiara tecta; quam illi tuphum appellant,</HI> although some modern Authors call it <HI>Calipora,</HI> as saies <HI>Niceforus Gregorius</HI> in <HI>libro sexto.</HI></P>
<P>Or Bishops then having two royal Dignities, to wit the spiritual and temporal, deservedly wear a double crown, as <HI>Innocent</HI> the third
<PB N="234" REF="132"/>
in his third sermon <HI>De coronatione Pontificis,</HI> confirms, saying that the Popebears the Mitre in token of the spiritual power, and the Crown in testimony of the Temporal, both which are conferred upon him by God omnipotent, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</P>
<P>But let us examine a little whether the Mitre, and the Crown, are Ornaments adapted to the Ecclesiastical customs.</P>
<P>The mitre by <HI>Suidas</HI> is called the swathe or Fillet of the head, bound about with gold and silver as <HI>Brissonius</HI> explains: and <HI>Eusebi∣us</HI> in his second book, the first Chapter, calls it a shelter; with which Saint <HI>James</HI> the Apostle called the Brother of our Lord, was sud∣dainly adorned, when by the Apostles he was chosen and consecra∣ted Bishop of <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> which Ornament, although it took be∣ginning with <HI>Aaron</HI> Priest of the Hebrew Law, is nevertheless re∣ceived into the Christian Church, to the end that therewith the Bi∣shops of all Nations may be adorned. <HI>Policrates Ephesinus</HI> wore the Mitre (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> in the 31st Chapter of the third Book relates) as Priest of <HI>Ephesus:</HI> and likewise the other Priests wore almost all the Ornaments of the antient Priests, as the Robe, and the Mitre, that they might appear the more adorned and majestick saies <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his Book; whereof <HI>Amalarius, Rabanus,</HI> and others the gravest Authors treat more amply.</P>
<P>What we have spoken touching the Mitre is without contradi∣ction, and is held for truth by the consent of many and sundry Na∣tions, but what is to be spoken touching a Kingdome, and a Roy∣al Crown, is not so perspicuous to all, wherefore to our best power we will endeavour to manifest the same.</P>
<P>Then first is to be observed, that tis the common opinion of all, that this sort of Ornament upon the head of the Pope had its origi∣nal from the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, as appears in the Acts of <HI>San Silvestre</HI> the Pope: the same opinion is also embraced by all o∣ther <HI>Roman</HI> Bishops, as by <HI>Leo</HI> the ninth in the 13. chapter of his E∣pistle against the presumption of <HI>Michaele,</HI> and <HI>Innocent</HI> the third in his first Sermon of the blessed <HI>Silvester,</HI> confirms That <HI>Constantine</HI> the great at his departure from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> would have bestowed his own Crown upon <HI>San Silvester,</HI> which he refused, but in lieu thereof put a covering upon his head entirely circular, and a little after <HI>Innocent</HI> follows in words to this sence: And for this cause the <HI>Roman Bishop,</HI> in testimony of Empire, wears a Regal crown called in Latin <HI>Regnum,</HI> and in testimony of his Pontificacy he wears a Mitre, which is most convenient, for him in all times and places universally, because the spiritual power hath been ever esteemed for the Prior, more worthy and more great then the Tempo∣ral. And reason will yeeld, that <HI>San Silvester</HI> would not wear that Crown, but such a one as only covered the Temples, in respect his head was shaven as the Popes ought to be. Which shaving gave good reason that twas not decent to wear such a Diadem, but ra∣ther that circular covering which he chose named properly <HI>Tiara Phrigia,</HI> whereof <HI>Juvenal</HI> speaks in his sixth satyr saying.
<Q><L>Et Phrygia vestitur buca tiara.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which Ornament may be supposed to be borrowed either from
<PB N="235" REF="132"/>
<HI>Phrygia</HI> or <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> as we please, because the <HI>Phrigians</HI> had their original from the <HI>Phoenicians.</HI> And that this was given the Pope by the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, is most evident in the Acts of <HI>San Sil∣vester,</HI> where the Emperor reckons up those things, that he had be∣stowed on the Pope, and being come to this, gives it the name <HI>Phry∣gium,</HI> as twas its proper name; but in respect twas not manifest to all, what thing <HI>Phrygium</HI> denoted, he explains himself in the sence by us set down, saying
<Q>et Phrygium nempe tegmen capitis sive Mitram.</Q></P>
<P>This particular required so much explanation, for that <HI>Theodorus Balsamones,</HI> confounding the signification of <HI>Phrygium,</HI> by joining it with the subsequent <HI>Lorum,</HI> which imports a perfect different thing hath caused many to erre in beleeving that <HI>Phrygium</HI> and <HI>Lorum</HI> put together do denote <HI>Pallium,</HI> the Cope which Arch- Bishops wear by the concession of the highest Bishop. But tis not convenient for us to dwell longer upon the dispute, let the intelligent read the latin <HI>Itine∣rary</HI> in this place, where they'l meet an ample discourse upon the sig∣nifications of these words.</P>
<P>Other authors will have, that this Crown came not from <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> but from <HI>Clodoveo,</HI> as they labour to draw from <HI>Segeberto</HI> un∣der the yeer of our Lord 550. who speaks to this sence, <HI>Clodoveus</HI> the King received from <HI>Anastasius</HI> the Emperor, the Codicils of the Consulacy, a Crown of Gold with Jewels, and the red garment, and on that day he was called Consul and King, but the same King sent to Saint Peter at <HI>Rome</HI> the Crown of Gold with the Jewels, the Roy∣al Ensigne, which is called <HI>Regnum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Armonius</HI> also confirms in his first book the 24th. Chapter, that from <HI>Clodoveus</HI> the Pope had the Crown: and <HI>Anastasius</HI> the Library Keeper under Pope <HI>Hormisda,</HI> testifies that Saint <HI>Peter</HI> received many gifts: In whom I have read, that in the yeer 776 that <HI>Philip</HI> the first Pope and <HI>Constantine</HI> the second Pope were both consecra∣ted in <HI>San Peters</HI> Church (but we must observe that the antient Au∣thors under the word consecration understand also the ceremony of coronation) for that when they say, that <HI>Charles</HI> the great was con∣secrated Emperor, they also by it understand he was Crowned, whence we may draw, that the Coronation of the Pope, had its rise in long since past times, since that in the yeer 683. under <HI>Aga∣thone</HI> the first, and <HI>Benedict</HI> the second, was raised the custome of gi∣ving moneys at the coronation of the Pope, and of expecting the authority of the Emperor. <HI>Eugenius</HI> the second was crowned the 22d. of <HI>May</HI> in the yeer 824. <HI>Benedict</HI> in the yeer 855, <HI>Formosus</HI> the first in 891. But after <HI>Clement</HI> which happened in <HI>anno</HI> 1044. all succeeding Popes were crowned as (<HI>Panuinus</HI> observes) in such a man∣ner, as by it from that time forwards, the Prophecy of <HI>Isaiah</HI> in the sixty first Chapter may be well known to be fulfilled, where he saies as our English Translation renders it: <HI>For he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvatio, he hath covered me with the Robe of Righteousnesse, as a Bridegroom decketh himself with or∣naments:</HI> The <HI>Italian</HI> saies, they (meaning the Priests) are crowned as Bridegroom: after that the Pope is elevated to this supremedig∣nity
<PB N="236" REF="133"/>
he wears the garments of eternal peace, and a Crown upon his head: This is that Son of <HI>Eliachim</HI> spoken of from God by <HI>Isaiah</HI> the Prophet in the 22d. Chapter, to whom even at that time God pro∣mised the Robe the Crown and the Key, as you may read in the 20. 21, 22, 23, and 24. verses of that Chapter and so forwards: The Crown is an Ensigne of Empire, the Robe is a signe of familiar go∣vernment, the which things are found in their excellency in our Pope. So in the 14th Chapter of the <HI>Revelation</HI> of Saint <HI>John,</HI> at the 14th verse tis said that Christ (named the Son of man) appeared sit∣ting on a white cloud, adorned with a golden Crown upon his head. And in the 19th. of the <HI>Revelations</HI> about the 11th. verse tis said, that the same Word of God appeared upon a white horse, with many Regal Crowns upon his head and all his Friends, as may be read in the subsequent verses.</P>
<P>For this occasion principally were these significations by Crowns to wit that Christ through his Wisdom (signified by the figure of a Crown of Gold) hath obtained victory over all Creatures, and sub∣jected them to his Dominion. So likewise the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop who is ouer all Nations, who hath brought all the People under his au∣thority, (by the <HI>consignation</HI> and power of God) deservedly puts on the covering of his head three Crowns, thereby demonstrating that in glory, Authority, and great works, he surpasseth all the other Kings and Princes of the world.</P>
<P>After so many fore-passed Popes, <HI>Paulus the</HI> second created in the yeer 8465. of the noble <HI>Venetian</HI> Family <HI>Barbi,</HI> as he was of a fair a∣spect and great Spirit, so he took great care to adorn the papal Mi∣tre, with pretious Jewels and curious workmanship. Lastly let us advertise the Reader that in those breifs written by <HI>Caesar Costni</HI> in the third chapter of the first book of his various doubts deceives himself, where he would maintain that the Popes bearing a Mitre with three Crowns proceeds from those mysterious significations by him alleaged, when indeed there is no necessity of them and let thus much suffice.</P>

<P>GOD granted to the <HI>Jewes</HI> divine benefits indeed, whereupon afterwards that Nation boasted, saying, That his divine Maje∣sty had not treated other People after that manner: But those graces which the Church our Mother hath received from the good∣ness
<PB N="237" REF="133"/>
of God do far surpass and exceed the Benefits bestowed upon the Hebrew People: For that the Lord that she might be clean and adorned in his sight, gave the blood of his only Son to wash her, and the Treasure of his Wisdome to beautifie her. Among the other be∣nefits conferred on the Hebrew Synagogue, that of the yeer of Jubi∣le was most excellent, called most holy, for that it was the yeer of remission and of the commencement of all things, which the Om∣nipotent God ordained to be from 50 to 50 yeers. The like grace be∣ing due to our Church the Spouse of Christ (though with a different end, for that the Synagogue attended only to temporal affairs, and the holy Church to spirituals singly) by divine disposition she thought convenient to ordain also the yeer of Jubile, though at first only from 100. yeers to 100. yeers. perhaps to draw to good use, the antient diabolick custom of the celebration of the secular Games, which to this end were celebrated every hundredth yeer in <HI>Rome,</HI> with a preceding general invitation from Cryers, who proclaimed through the streets come to the games, the which none ever saw since, nor shall again: which drew into the City of <HI>Rome</HI> infinite People of all Nations for the service of the de∣vil: And all those Nations since the institution of the yeer of Jubi∣le, render themselves at <HI>Rome</HI> though with much better reason <HI>viz.</HI> to serve the true God, for the salvation of their own souls: nor ought our pains seem strange to any, for what is said concerning the mutation of evil into good, because that not only in this, but in divers other occasions the holy Church hath had this aime, to con∣secrate that to God, which the foolish generations had before time dedicated to Satan, as may be seen in divers Temples of <HI>Rome, now</HI> dedicated to the true Lord, and his Saints, which were former∣ly the Temples of Idols used for the distribution of candles, and to make their Feasts, as in <HI>San Pietro</HI> in <HI>Vincola,</HI> the first of <HI>August,</HI> the first of those ceremonies was made in <HI>Rome,</HI> in honour of <HI>Februa</HI> by the <HI>Romans</HI> taken for a Goddess, the other in memory of the tri∣umph of <HI>Augustus Caesar.</HI> We find that <HI>Boniface</HI> the 9th. in the yeer 1300. published the yeer of Jubile by his Bull, wherein he declares as a Restorer rather then an Inventor or institutor of this yeer: And tis no wonder, that we find no firm testimony of its institution before that time, because the Church hath had so many persecuti∣ons, and so great toiles, that tis a miracle that any antient Memori∣als are preserved rather then a wonder that some are lost. At that time then, the Pope in writing divulged this yeer, conceding entire and plenary remission of offences and punishments every hundredth yeer, which number of (Centum) one hundred, bears also a certain sense of returning to good from evil, as is fully proved by <HI>Girola∣mus</HI> and <HI>Beda,</HI> principal Ecclesiastical writers.</P>
<P><HI>Clement</HI> the sixth at the Instance of the <HI>Romans</HI> reduced Jubile to every fiftieth yeer, chiefly for that the life of man is so short, that ve∣ry few arrive to one hundred yeers, and for that in the number <HI>quin∣qua ginta</HI> fifty, are contained many mysteries pertinent to the Christi∣an Religion; but principally it signifies remission and pardon, the proper effect of the Jubile. Moreover the Jewish synagogue had its Jubile every 50. yeers, so that if for no other reason, at leastwise that the Synagogue might not appear richer then the Church twas
<PB N="238" REF="134"/>
fit, that she should likewise have a Jubile every fifty yeers.</P>
<P><HI>Urban</HI> the sixth reduced it to thirty three yeers for the increase of the Church treasure, afterwards to be disposed of by Saint <HI>Peter</HI> and his successors on the like occasions. But last of all <HI>Paul</HI> the se∣cond reduced it to every 25th yeer, and so <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth his suc∣cessor observed it, as in like manner have all following Popes done. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e which we must believe was made for many considerations, and chiefly for these, for that the world as it grows old becomes worse both in quantity and quality of Life▪ so that through the thousand dangers which alwaies threaten life, and through the infinite Sins wherein many Creatures are involved, it hath appeared good to re∣duce the time of Remission to a shorter time, whereby to offer fre∣quent invitations to all, to accept the spiritual Medicine of Redemp∣tion of so great vertue) and to fly the works of iniquity.</P>
<P>As to what appertains to the name, tis to be observed, that it may be called in Latin <HI>Jobileus &amp; Iobileus,</HI> of which the last is least used, notwithstanding that by the vulgar, tis more frequently called <HI>Giubileo</HI> than otherwise: This word is not derived from <HI>Giubilo,</HI> which signifies Mirth and content (although in truth it ought to be a yeer of rejoycing) but from the hebrew word <HI>Jobel,</HI> wich is as much as to say a Trumpet or Sacbut, for that the Israelites the seventh month before the fiftieth yeer used to proclaim the yeer of Jubile with the sound of Trumpets: furt hermore the Hebrew word <HI>Jobel</HI> also signifies remission and beginning, the proper actions for the yeer of Jubile, for then the <HI>Jews</HI> remitted all debts, and returned all things to their first state.</P>
<P>The Pope cannot concede greater indulgences, then those which are granted in the yeer of Jubile, for then they open the treasury of the Church, and bestow on every one as much as is absolutely ne∣cessary for him, pardoning to him sins and penances, as well imposed as not imposed, freeing of him wholly and absolutely from purga∣tory, yea although he should have forgottē his mortal sins in his con∣fession or that he should not have confessed the Venial sins (for tis not of necessity to make cōfession of Venial sins although such must suf∣fer pains in purgatory for them, if they be not in some way cancelled in this world) in such manner, that the soul that in that time shall part from the body, doth instantly fly to enjoyment of the selicity of Paradise.</P>
<P>Our Jubile hath certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>imilitudes with that of the Jewes, for that they proclaimed the yeer before, so do we ours: That they published in the Piazza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s, we ours in the Churches: that they with Trumpets, we ours with the voice of the Preachers: In that they left the Land unmanured, ours by the merits of Christ and his Saints supplies our Labour: in that Servants became free, in ours we ac∣quire spiritual liberty with pardon of sins and penances, in that they redeemed their Credits, in ours we receive pardon for our offences: in that sould possessions returned to their first Patrons, in ours our crimes being cancelled the power and virtue of the soul is vivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ied: in that banished persons returned to their Countrey, and in ours, who departs this life, immediately ascends to the hea∣venly Countrey.

<HI>Boniface</HI> the eighth opened the doors of the Church <HI>Vaticano,</HI> and bestowed most ample indulgences of all sins; <HI>Clement</HI> the sixth, ad∣ded the doors of the Church <HI>Lateranense,</HI> ordaining as is above de∣clared. <HI>Paulus</HI> the second afterwards added <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore</HI> and <HI>San Paolo,</HI> in the <HI>Via Ostiense,</HI> for visitation. <HI>Gregory</HI> the 13th. in <HI>anno</HI> 1575. ordained, that who would participate the grace of the Jubile, should first communicate in the yeer of Jubile: allplena∣ry indulgences are understood to be suspended with certain muta∣tions of words, of which the Authors treating on the Jubile, speak to that purpose.</P>
<P>The Hebrews proclaimed their Jubile the 10th day of the sea∣venth moneth of the forty and ninth yeer. Ours, we publish on <HI>Ascention</HI> day in the yeer preceding the twenty fifth yeer, upon two pulpits in the Church <HI>San Pietro,</HI> reading the Popes Bull in Latin and the vulgar.</P>
<P>We begin our Jubile, on the Vigil of the birth day of our Lord in the evening, when the Pope with great solemnity opens the door of the Church <HI>San Pietro,</HI> which at all other times stands continually wal∣led up: and he causeth the Lords Cardinals at the same time in the same manner, to open the doors of the other deputed Churches, all which doors (the yeer ended) are again shut up.</P>
<P>In the holy yeer, that is to say the Jubile, resort so great con∣course of People from all Countreys to <HI>Rome,</HI> that historians write, that at the time of the Jubile of Pope <HI>Boniface, Rome</HI> was so full of people, that one could hardly pass in the City, though so great: and in the yeer 1505. the feet of <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth, in one mor∣ning were kissed by thirteen thousand persons. <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. in <HI>anno</HI> 1600. would needs wash the feet of divers Prelates, and other poor strangers come to the Jubile: and the most illustrious Cardinals among which were <HI>Montalto</HI> and <HI>Farnese</HI> expressed great charity and humility to poor pilgrims.</P>
<P>That tis convenient to celebrate the Jubile in <HI>Rome,</HI> rather then any other City is maintained by pregnant reasons: <HI>Rome</HI> is the most worthy and noble of all other Cities and we therefore understand when we name <HI>Citta</HI> or City, without any other appellation, that it must be <HI>Rome.</HI> She hath had the Empire, is the head, the Mistris, and a compendium of the World. She is full of Riches: hath beauty in her Scite, her Country, fertility of soyl, great comodiousness from the Navigation of the <HI>Tyber,</HI> and the proximity of the Sea. She is the common Countrey of all, and in her are of all Nations, and eve∣ry people may there find a proper Church for their own Nation, as in deed most Countreys have. There Religion flourisheth more than elsewhere as appears by the infinite Priests and Fryers, which there at leastwise in their diuine duties, if not continually praise the Lord and pray for all. There the Churches are much visited, the Poor releived, the virgins married, and many other pious works perfor∣med worthy of perpetual memory. She is a City of singular sancti∣ty, and in her are placed the most noted things appertaining to our Religion as the Manger wherein our Lord was layed at his birth, the swa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ling clothes, the Cradle, the garment, the Coronation Robe, the Crown of thorns, the Nailes, the Iron of the Launce, the eross▪ and the Title of Christ. In it are bodies of Apostles, of Martyrs,

of Confessors, of Virgins, and infinite Reliques of Saints. She is the seat of the Pope, who is Prince of the Church, Vicar of God, Pastor of all, who when abroad, is beheld, admired and adored by all, every one seeking to kiss his Feet, wondring at the <HI>grandezza</HI> of the Cardinals, the gravity of the Bishops and the multitude of the Priests. A treasury of Indulgencies in <HI>Rome</HI> lye continually exposed to whomsoever needs them, where in former times the Christians were persecuted and more cruelly intreated then in any other place. And finally the Faith of the <HI>Romans</HI> was and is such, that e∣ven in the Apostles times, it was preached through the world, that is to say in that part only then styled <HI>Roman</HI> before twas Christianiz'd <HI>Rome,</HI> then (which in greek imports strength, in hebrew Greatness) being the most worthy place of the whole world, with good reason in her and not elsewhere, ought the Jubile to be celebra∣ted.</P>

<HEAD>The Narration of <HI>STEPHANO PIG∣HIO</HI> touching those military Ensignes, which the Pope useth to bestow on tem∣poral Princes. CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop useth to bestow great honour on Princes, which for all that doth seldom happen, from the rarity of the occasions for which they are sought. This custom was most antient, begun with the foundation of the holy scripture in the history of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> (part of our <HI>Apocrypha</HI>) as we read in the 15th. Chapter of the second book of <HI>Maccabees:</HI> That <HI>Judas</HI> the Captain of the Israelite Army before he came to battail against <HI>Nica∣nor,</HI> saw in a Vision <HI>Onias</HI> the high Priest, holding up his hands towards Heaven, and praying for the whole people of the Jews: and <HI>Jeremias</HI> the Prophet, giving unto him the said <HI>Judas</HI> a sword of gold exhorting him to give battail in these words: Take this holy sword a gift from God, wherewith thou shalt wound thy adversaries, wherewith <HI>Judas</HI> being comforted, drew to battail on the sabbath against the Enemies, and behaved himself so well, that he slew not less then thirty five thousand Men, with <HI>Nicanor</HI> their Captain and so remained victorious. Hence then proceeds the custome, that the <HI>Roman</HI> high Priest every yeer, the night before the Nativity, be∣fore he begins the Duties, blesseth and consecrateth a sword, with the scabbard, the belt, and the pummel of gold, and a hat placed on the top of it, not made after the common sort, of Felt, but of the finest blew silk, with the whitest Ermine skinns round about it, and a Crown of gold enterwoven all over and set out with Jewels of good value. This is a noble donative wch. the Pope provides only of that night, to bestow it upon some Christian Prince, who either hath done or is to undertake some notable impress for the Christian Reli∣gion:
<PB N="241" REF="135"/>
nor is this without mysteries, but hath many, the which eve∣ry Christian Prince ought to know, and consider.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Rivale</HI> teacheth us, that the sword so consecrated, tipifies the infinite power of God, which is in the eternal word, wherewith God hath created all things: Which word on that night put on human flesh, and to which the Father Eternal gave all Power, as himself declared about the time of his Ascention into heaven, and then consigned it to Saint Peter, and to his successors, whose duty tis to govern that holy Church then newly by him instituted, and consecrated with his own blood, against which hell should not pre∣vail: Commanding that they should teach all those things which were learned from him, and to invite and intreat, all Nations (through Baptism and the Gospel) to enter this new City, out of which there is no salvation, and in which they must obey the Laws of the divine Empire. Who is not surprized with consideration of the dispensations of God, in the divine Majesties election of this Ci∣ty <HI>Rome,</HI> for the head and bulwark of the Christian Republique, which was upon the point at that time Head and Lady of the whole world. Whence Saint <HI>Peter</HI> the Governour of the first Church was destinated to this Province, and twas commanded to him, that the Cross should Triumph in the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> to the end that thereby and thence the light of eternal truth might with the more facility be dispersed into all parts.</P>
<P>By the sword then thus consecrated is denoted that Empire, and that supreme power of government upon Earth, which Christ left to Saint <HI>Peter</HI> his Vicar, and to his successors; and that the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop ought to be acknowledged for the head of Christianity, whom, all those that tender their own Salvation, ought to obey and serve in spirituals for the love of Christ.</P>
<P>Furthermore that sword signifies, what prudence, and Justice, e∣very Prince ought to observe, and because the sharp point wounds where tis thrust on by the hand, therefore the handle of this sword is adorned with gold, a metal which amongst the Antients impor∣ted Wisdom, whereby the Prince ought to learn, that near his hands wisdome must have her seate, that so he may not transact any thing rashly, nor without due consideration, Gold hath been taken for the Symbol of Wisdome, from her similitude in Excellency, for as the one surpasseth and mastereth all metals in goodness and value, so Prudence or Wisdome, as we may say, surpasseth and overcometh all other things, And this caused <HI>Solomon</HI> in his proverbs to make his exhortation saying, My Son possess thou Wisdome, which is better than Gold, and get thou Prudence, for this is more pretious than Silver, Saint John in the <HI>Apocalyps</HI> calleth wisdome enflamed Gold, which penetiates the breast with the ardour of the holy Spi∣rit. The <HI>Magi</HI> offered Gold to Christ then an Infant, and the <HI>Egyp∣tians</HI> were despoyled of their Gold by the <HI>Israelites,</HI> the one and the other thereby signifying, Wisdome in a mistical sence; and twas so in truth spoken literally as our histories relate <HI>Plato</HI> (whose doctrine did not much disagree from the Christian) often compares Wisdome and the Beauty of the mind to pure gold. Finally the Aunt and Gryphen of <HI>India</HI> signified no other thing wch. <HI>Animals</HI> (as antiquity feigned) got together as much gold as possibly they could and after∣wards
<PB N="242" REF="136"/>
kept it with diligence: even so Wisdome is not to be had without labour, and noblenesse of mind; the Aunt here being an embleme of a laborious Creature, and the Gryffen (feigned to pro∣ceed from the copulation of an Eagle and a Lyon) here represents the greatness of mind. Whence the same antients wisely and pro∣perly dedicated the Aunt and the Gryffen to <HI>Apollo</HI> the God of wis∣dome.</P>
<P>Moreover the sword signifies the Tongue, the best and worst member in Man, as it happens to be imployed: and therefore the antient said, that evil spoken men carryed a sword in their mouth: and <HI>Diogenes</HI> the Cynick, seeing a fair young man to speak dishone∣stly, sayed to him, art thou not ashamed, to draw a sword of Lead out of an ivory scabbard? and in <HI>Isaiah</HI> we read <HI>Posuit os meum quasi gladium acutum:</HI> and Christ in the Gospel saies. <HI>Non veni pacem mit∣tere sed gladium,</HI> where we see, that by the sword is intended the word preached from God; and so in other places of Scripture un∣der the name word, is comprehended the tongue or the sword wherefore aptly also to our purpose it may receive the same signifi∣cation, the Pope giving to understand to Princes, that they in par∣ticular ought to have their tongue and speech adorned with Gold, that is to say clothed with wisdom and prudence, with which sword they ought to separate the good thoughts from the bad, and by their wise counsels to penetrate and see into the very hearts of o∣thers.</P>
<P>To this misterious sword the holy Pope adjoyns a belt interwo∣ven with gold, which even of old was a sign of Majesty and military dignity: well then may the Prince (on whom tis bestowed) appre∣hend the exhortation by it given him, to demean himself well for the holy Church against all factions.</P>
<P>The Hat, which is the covering of the head, the most noble part of man, is an Ensigne of nobility and liberty, which hat also an∣tiently was wont to be made in the form of a half sphere, as twere one part of a great egg divided just in the midst, but in later times our modern ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ificers not apprehending the significations, or willing to fructifie humours, make it after another fashion. Its round form putting us in minde of Heaven, by which we are covered, and ad∣viseth the Prince, to direct all his actions to the glory of God, and the benefit of his soul, for whose eternal dwelling were the Heavens made: the celestial colour of the said hat denotes the same thing.</P>
<P>The white colour of the skins and the Pearl, signifies that since∣rity and purity of the mind wherewith the Prince ought to be en∣dowed, to the end he may in the end accomplish a concomitance with those most sacred minds, the wch to that time he hath or ought to have endeavoured to imitate with all clearness of conscience. The Colour white, hath been alwaies esteemed gratefull to the Almigh∣ty, being a mark of Inocency &amp; therfore from great antiquity all men in the duty of sacrifice used to cloth themselves therwith; <HI>Pythagoras</HI> his sentence is, that every white thing is good. Fully in his second book <HI>De legibus</HI> saies, that white is very agreeable to God. We might also bring testimonies to this purpose from <HI>Cicero</HI> and others, but to what end should we search prophane authors: since Christ himself
<PB N="243" REF="136"/>
in his glorious Transfiguration made himself obvious to many, clo∣thed with rayments white as snow: and the Angels also who were at the sepulchre of our Lord the morning of his resurrection day, when the women went to seek after the most holy body, presented themselves in whitegarments: from the above specified records the Prince is advised of the nature of that Animal the Ermine, off which those skins are taken, for the Ermine is infinitly neat, and enemie to filthiness and durt, in so much that the mouth of their Cave being environed by the hunters with dirt, they do rather expose themselvs to be taken then to run for their escape through dirt to defile them∣selves.</P>
<P>All which things then advise us. That God does expect in us, Cleaness of heart, sincerity of tongue, wisedom of mind, elevation of the understanding and prudence in our actions. whereof his Ho∣linesse by that beatified sword adorned in the aforecited manner, in∣tends to give the Prince a continual remembrance, that in goodness and works he ought to surpasse all other sort of people in an emi∣nent degree, begin by the omnipotent God in the government of the world made so much superiour to all other People.</P>
<P>The Prince at the reception of this gift, kneels down, and the Pope then gives it him, exhorting him by many expressions to be a good souldier of Christ: Then the Prince acknowledging the Pope as Vicar of God returns his thanks in Latin, swearing that he will not lay any thing more to heart, then a correspondence by his acti∣ons, with the desire of his holiness, and all other Christian Princes: afterwards he delivers the Sword to his most noble and chief Mini∣ster who bears it before the Cross while the Pope goes out of the Ve∣stry. At last, having had a congratulation from the Cardinals and Embassadors, and taken leave, the Prince with the sword born up before him, being accompanyed by the Governors of the Castle, Saint <HI>Angelo,</HI> by the Comptrolor of the Pallace, by all the Nobility, by the Pontifical Family, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> Court, with great Pomp and the sounding of Trumpets and noise of Drumms, he marcheth out of the Palace by the military Porticue, thus attended to his own Dwelling.</P>

<P>In our times this Castle received a foul disgrace from the hands of <HI>Hariadeno Barbarossa</HI> Captain of the Turkish <HI>Armada,</HI> who by a sud∣dain in road took it, leading away all the Souldiers and Inhabitants sacking the Castle, prophaning the Churches, and arrived at his Gallies clapt all his prisoners into Chains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Strada Appia</HI> is the largest, and was the famousest among the o∣ther twenty eight streets or ways of note, which took beginning at <HI>Rome,</HI> and was called the Queen of streets: because that by it passed to <HI>Rome</HI> such as came triumphing from the East. <HI>Appio Claudio</HI> made it as far as <HI>Capua,</HI> and <HI>Caligula</HI> caused it to be paved with square stones, and lastly <HI>Trajane</HI> renewed and restored it to <HI>Brandizzo,</HI> beautify∣ing it on each side with a green hedge of Laurels, Bayes, Pomgranats, and Mastick trees: pursuing this way before arrival at <HI>Fondi</HI> you meet the <HI>Mons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> noted amongst the antients for the good wine it bore as <HI>Martial</HI> saith.

<HEAD>GAETA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> speaks in honour of <HI>GAETA</HI> or <HI>CAJETA</HI> in these verses.
<Q><L>Tu quoque littoribus nostris AEneia nutrix</L>
<L>AEternam moriens famam Cajeta dedisti.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>GAETA</HI> enjoyeth a Port and a Fort, which heretofore <HI>Ferdi∣nando</HI> King of the <HI>Arragonians</HI> founded in a Corner of the <HI>Promonto∣ry</HI> towards the East, having then driven the <HI>French</HI> out of the King∣dome of <HI>Naples:</HI> within our memory the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the 5th. added to it the neighbouring rock, conjoyning it by a bridge, which may be drawn up at pleasure, to the rock that is highest, and so re∣doubled the buildings, augmenting its strength, with Towers and ramparts, and enclosing the whole mountain, joyned it to the City by Ditches and Walls: from which Towers (such is their contri∣vance) the Port and the City though lying much lower, receive a perfect defence and protection: being alwaies guarded with a good garison of <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers: nor is any person permitted to enter, neither stranger Townesman or Country man.</P>
<P>The City therefore may be well esteemed secure, since so well provided for by art, with all those Forts bulwarks, &amp;c. and by nature, by its own scituation, having contiguous with it, that <HI>Pro∣montory</HI> as twere hanging over it, and almost round it the waters of the Sea, being as twere in a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> having but a narrow <HI>Isth∣mus</HI> to come to it by Land, excellently defended by a bridge, a Gate, a Fort, and the Sea waters on each side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Promontory</HI> shews it self with two Heads, on that side regar∣ding the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> lies the City on the plainest and levelled part, on the other Cliffs, Rocks, and Praecipices which extend into the Sea; tis open from top to bottom, occasioned by a great earth∣quake, and that a long time since, such many times happening in these parts of Italy. The old Poets and Prophets sometimes cal∣led <HI>Neptune, Ennosigaeo,</HI> and <HI>Sifittone,</HI> for that as they feigned he tur∣ned upside down the foundations of the mountains with his <HI>Trident.</HI> The Inhabitants and neighbouring people in boats with great de∣votion row into that wide space, and religiously reverence the place: for that they certainly believe that mountain was thus cleft in sunder by an earthquake, at the time our Redeemer Jesus Christ suffered upon the Cross for the salvation of mankind: as in the ho∣ly Gospel we find it written, that at that time the Mountains, and stones were rent in sunder. in the midst of the opening of this moun∣tain, stands a Church and a very rich Monastery dedicated to the most sacred and great Trinity, built with the alms of devout souls, you may there see a vast stone, so fallen from the top of the mountain
<PB N="253" REF="141"/>
that it may be said to be sustained by a miracle between the broken walls of the opening, where it begins to narrow. There <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Arragonia,</HI> erected a fair Chappel, dedicating it to the <HI>S. S. Trinita,</HI> which appears as in the Sea, and they go to it from the mo∣nastery by a way made with hands in the rupture of the Mountain: the broken stones on one side, and the hollowed places whence they fell on the other, when tom out by the earthquake, afford an enticing object.</P>
<P>Among other things there worth a view, is a shrine made by <HI>Charls</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> a famous though wicked Captain of later times, who in the bloody assault and sack of <HI>Rome</HI> dyed of a wound from a gun∣shot: The bones of this bad man, are enclosed in a chest or coffin of wood covered with black silk, and are obvious at the first en∣trance of the Castle in an eminent place: under it may be read this Epitaph.

<P>From which a Chronologer may collect, it is of neare sixteen hun∣dred yeers standing, and built in the time of <HI>Augustus Caesar:</HI> which for its entirenesse on every side of the sea seems a miracle, the people now call it <HI>Torre Orlandina,</HI> the reward of the rustickness of posterity, who little regarding the antiquity of history, originate the works and famous deeds of their ancestors, at their own time, and attri∣bute them to whom they please.

<P>At the entrance of the gate is a space of seven foot wide, made out of the in ward Circle, all small manufacture of bricks, and con∣joined with the walls without with a high Arch: and that inclosed by other high Arches represents in the middle of the <HI>Mauseolum</HI> the form of a round Temple, which hath foure large receptacles for pre∣serving of statues.

Book) the <HI>Pemetini</HI> retired themselves, when driven out of their Country <HI>Pometia,</HI> destroyed by <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> whence it began to be called <HI>Suessa</HI> and now <HI>Sessa,</HI> it was also named <HI>Suessa</HI> by the <HI>Aurunci</HI> (as <HI>Livy</HI> testifies) who being overcome by <HI>Titus Manlius</HI> the Consul, aiding their adversaries the <HI>Sidicini,</HI> recovered this place with their wives and Children: This City is scituate in the <HI>Campagna Vestina</HI> near the <HI>Monte Massico</HI> on the <HI>Strada Appia,</HI> in a pleasant fertile &amp; Country: and was esteemed for being the princi∣pal City of the <HI>Volsci,</HI> as well as for being a Confine to the <HI>Romans:</HI> twas made a Colony about 440. yeers after the birth of <HI>Rome</HI> as may be collected from <HI>Livy,</HI> though <HI>Velius</HI> writes, that people were sent thither and a Colony made three yeers after <HI>Luceria:</HI> it groaned un∣der frequent losses, and important destructions, both in the <HI>Car∣thaginian</HI> war, and in the civil Factions: but afterwards from these misfortunes rousing it self, it flourished under the Emperors, chiefly under <HI>Adrian</HI> and <HI>Antonini Pii,</HI> as we draw from the Titles of Sta∣tues, from the Elogies, and inscriptions on Marble Tablets, extant in divers places thereabouts.</P>

Maria Nova,</HI> lye interred the bones of <HI>Odetto Foix</HI> named <HI>Lotrecce:</HI> and of <HI>Pietro Namarro,</HI> of <HI>Con∣salvo Ferrando Cordovese,</HI> and in the most religious Tabernace of <HI>San Giannuacio,</HI> are preserved many holy reliques of Saints. Where once in the yeer at least they shew one by one, all those worthy objects: as bones of Saints and other Reliques enclosed in gold and Silver with pretious stones, with the pretious gifts bestowed by Kings and Princes, and other things. Among which with great re∣verence, is the head of <HI>S. Gianuario,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> the Martyr; and his bloud stil remaining in a glass vial, though dryed and be∣come hard through time: which vial when brought to the Altar is set near the head of the Martyr, on the Corner of the <HI>Chorus:</HI> and the blood (to admiration) begins to become liquid and to boyl as new wine in the must, as hath been annually observed and seen by all, not without great stupour. Thence you go to the <HI>Annunci∣ata,</HI> a Church famous through the great devotion there exercised, and rich through the many offerings made to it: as also for many reliques of Saints of importance, among others two small bodies of a foot and half long, yet entire, covered with the skins of in∣nocent Children slain by <HI>Herode</HI> the King, at the time our Saviour was born in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> the wound of one is in the head, the other in the breast.</P>
<P>Contiguous with which lies an hospital, built like a spatious Ca∣stle, wherein are maintained as their condition, age, and health re∣quire, two thousand souls: therein are also brought up children of
<PB N="265" REF="147"/>
the poorer sort, more than eight hundred, between orphane and ex∣posed infants as well males as females: instructed in letters and art, according to their inclination till they become great. 'Tis a plea∣sure to see and observe their several diligent exercises and works: and this custome of Christian Charity is certainly very comodious, which as <HI>Corona Pighius</HI> observes, resembles <HI>Platoes</HI> Republique in part, and imitates that Economical government of the Apes, de∣scribed by <HI>Xenefonte,</HI> and by <HI>Virgil</HI> the Prince of Poets, described and de painted so well to the similitude of <HI>Platoes</HI> City.</P>
<P>Castle <HI>Nuovo,</HI> the name is new although built more then 300 yeers since by the Brother of <HI>San Lodovico,</HI> King of France, who was <HI>Charls</HI> the first King of <HI>Naples</HI> and Count of <HI>Anjou,</HI> to the end he might thence aid the City and the Port against the maritimate inroads of enemies. <HI>Alfonsus</HI> the first of this name, King of the <HI>Arragonians,</HI> re∣stored it within our memory, after he had expelled the French, and subdued the Kingdom; and so well fortifyed it, that tis now held one of the strongest Forts of <HI>Italy:</HI> more especially since the last Kings, the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the 5th. and <HI>Philip</HI> his Son com∣pleatly furnished it, and all the other Forts of this City, with victu∣als, good souldiers, and all other necessaries and engines of war to keep off the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the midst of this large Castle, stands the pompous Palace of the governors, furnished with royal and most lovely houshold-stuff wherein the King or Emperor may find a comodious receipt for all his Court: strangers are astonisht at the engines of war, the Artil∣lery, the great quantity of Iron Bullets, the murrions inlayed with gold and Silver, the Shields, the swords, the Launces, and the other preparation for war there continually preserved. and that admiration becomes much lessened, at the view of the said palace so richly laden with tapistry of silk interwoven with Jewels and gold, the engraving, the statues, pictures and the other noble furniture.</P>
<P>Thence you may see the Castle <HI>Del'ovo,</HI> so named for that the shelf which there in largeth it self to the similitude of an Island, retains an oval form. <HI>Collanutius</HI> writes that this Fort was built by <HI>William</HI> the third a <HI>Norman,</HI> and thence called <HI>Normannica,</HI> which afterwards <HI>Alfonsus</HI> the first King of the <HI>Arragonians,</HI> repaired and beautifyed in many things: tis said that the antient called this by a greek word <HI>Miagra,</HI> either from a salutatiferous plant there growing, or from the site and quality of the place, or for that twas difficult to escape out of it: This Mole is like an artificial street casting it self into the Sea, whither all the gentry in the evening resort for the benefit of the <HI>Fresco.</HI></P>
<P>The Townesmen shew one after another Grottes hollowed un∣der the shelf, also some old memorials erected upon Cliffs, and great quantity of Arms of different fashions.</P>
<P>Afterwards pass into the Court of the Palace by the Gulf of the Sea called by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Tazza, della forma;</HI> and if you would learn the discipline and labour of the <HI>Galleots</HI> you must view in the passage, the near shores, the Islands and Promontories round about, as <HI>Liseno, Procrite, Patecusa, Capreta, Herculaneo,</HI> and <HI>Atheneo</HI> or <HI>Miner∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>vio,</HI> which as <HI>Pliny</HI> relates was the residence of the <HI>Syrens,</HI> and that
<PB N="266" REF="148"/>
gave denomination to the Promontory: and here as <HI>Strabo</HI> records, <HI>Ulysses</HI> consecrated a Temple to <HI>Minerva,</HI> for his deliverance from the crafty wiles of the <HI>Syrens.</HI></P>
<P>For the most part 40 galleys lye in this Port, besides other vessels to discover and do other service: which Port is very large, and as well as is possible defended against fortune with a large bank; which for the space of 500. foot runs from the shore into the Sea in form of a bended arm: and the whole length and bredth made of huge pieces of squared stones.</P>
<P>There gusheth out at one end of the Mole a fountain of sweet water, conveighed thither through the midst of the said Bank; this fountain hath much marble under it, wherein the water is received, the name is drawn from a Latin word, the foundations are known to have been layed by <HI>Charls</HI> the second the <HI>French</HI> King above two hundred and eighty yeers ago: which <HI>Alfonsus</HI> the first a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> amplified with all magnificence afterwards as well as many other publique edifices within the City: this fancy also <HI>Charls</HI> the 5th. Emperor, and <HI>Philip</HI> his Son took up, in augmenting, fortifying and furnishing the same for its commodity and ornament, without respect to the expence.</P>
<P>Hither the mariners in little boats row persons to see the Galleys and the life of the slaves with their arts, who from the want of bread learn to speak with the words of the Poet <HI>Perseus, Venter Magister,</HI> &amp;c. and sitting, exercise themselves; together with the munition and naval preparations for war: here in a little time may be learnt the mariners art, with their manner of living, wherewith they keep their bodies in health, and the offices and charges of the Presidents of the Vessels: thence you go to see the denoted stables of the King, where are kept and managed whole heards of beautifull and va∣luable horses, where some Princes are always to be found, behol∣ding with attention and delight, their swift course, their wheelings, and turnings, made in as little room, and with as much art as is possible, their curvets and leaps of all four performed excellently at the nod of the switch of the Rider.</P>
<P>Thence you go to the Castle <HI>Santermo,</HI> on the top of the near mountain, very strong, looking on and defending, the City, the shore Port and Islands in the Sea: King <HI>Robert</HI> Son of <HI>Charls</HI> the second built it 250 yeers agoe, adding to it such strength and defences as render it little lesse than inexpugnable, the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the first and <HI>Philip</HI> his Son some years since enlarged the <HI>Guasto,</HI> conjoyning it with the City, and increasing the structures in the inward space with new walls and new forts.</P>
<P>On the top of the Hill you meet a most fair and rich Temple with a stately Monastery possessed by the <HI>Carthusians;</HI> In which Monaste∣ry if you can obtain so much favour from the Monks (who loving∣ly receive forraigners and shew their Monasterie) you will meet an ample satisfaction in the view of the Monks chamber in a corner of the Monastery: where you have as great delight as <HI>Italy</HI> affords: for on the right hand is presented to your view, the prospect of the Sea, as large as the eye can reach, the Islands <HI>Enarea, Caprea,</HI> and <HI>Pro∣chite</HI> and opposite the manured places of <HI>Pausilipo,</HI> the gulf of <HI>Surre∣nio,</HI> the streight of <HI>Surrentano,</HI> some Cities and many Burroughs:
<PB N="267" REF="148"/>
On the left hand the Field <HI>Holana,</HI> very large, and the mountain <HI>Vesuvius</HI> as high; then looking downwards, you behold <HI>Naples,</HI> which, whither to be styled the miracle of art or nature is disputable, since there you may see, have and enjoy, what ever is esteemed pleasing or sweet.</P>
<P>In the voyage see the garden of <HI>Gacia di Toleda,</HI> kept in as good or∣der as any, twas made with vast expence, and with as many curses; (being with the sweat and blood of enforced galley slaves, reduced to that perfection it now retains) in the time that his Fa∣ther <HI>Pietro di Toledo,</HI> continued Lord of the City and King∣dom, under the benevolent aspect of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th.</P>
<P>Nor is it a mean pleasure, to view the places surrounding the City worth the seeing, especially in a good season: the which are in that fertile plain, near the Sea in pleasant scites very pompous; and adorned by the nobles with magnificent Edifices and fair gar∣dens, well kept, and enriched: which have such plenty of Foun∣tains, grottoes made by art, and Fishponds adorned with Curral, mother of Perle, and Fish shels of all sorts, as the beauty is almost impossible to be ghes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed at, as also of Porticues, walks, vaults co∣vered with Leaves and Flowers of divers sorts, Roses, pomegra∣nates, collumnes and Lodges beautifyed with pictures, statues, and marbles of antiquity, and among those Lodges those of the <HI>Mar∣ques di vico,</HI> and the other Princes, placed on the strond near the <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> are very famous: as also the <HI>Villa</HI> of <HI>Bernardino Martizano</HI> adorned with many reliques of of antiquity; <HI>Poggio Reale,</HI> a vast Pa∣lace, built heretofore by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Arragonia,</HI> whither the King used to retreat, when he desired to repose himself, and to re∣create his minde from the fortunes of the Sea, in a blith and secure port. This Palace is contrived in this manner, four square Tow∣ers, upon four corners, are bound together by great Porticues, so that the Palace hath two bredths in a length, each Tower hath fair and pleasant Chambers aboue and below, and you passe from one to the other by the means of those open galleries; the Court in the midst is ascended by certain little steps, and therein a fountain and clear fishpond, and on all sides by the nod of the Master, from the pavements rise sprouts of water, by meanes of infinite subtile Cha∣nels there placed with art, and in such plenty that they suddenly wet all the aspicients not thinking of it, in the summer a sufficient cooling: these Fields by the <HI>vicinity</HI> of the <HI>Vesuvius</HI> enjoy great plenty of sweet waters, the Fire within forcing out many fountains of sweet waters purged and pure: hence also the <HI>Sebeto</HI> acknowledgeth its being and the greatnesse of its Chanel being con∣veighed into all the streets of <HI>Naples</HI> by Pipes under ground, to all the publique and private palaces and habitations: so great comodity of all things brings to its inhabitants, the Paradise of <HI>Italy (as Corona Pighio</HI> frequently and not improperly calls her) that flourishing part of the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> territory, although many times afflicted with wars and earthquakes.</P>

<HEAD>IL MONTE VESUVIO.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VEsevo,</HI> or <HI>Vesuvio,</HI> or <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> (so called by the Antients from the sparkling) was a most fair mountain; and formerly a good∣ly Countrey for about four miles compasse lay at top, which then produced the excellent <HI>Graeco,</HI> but tis now layed wast: Tis an i∣mitator, and companion or rather the Brother of flaming <HI>AEtna,</HI> and is begotten by earthquakes and fire, the materials whereof it conti∣nually retains in the profoundest part of it: which as if withheld within it self for some yeers till come to maturity, and as if the spi∣rits were summoned and fomented, with fury evaporates fire, breaks open the firm parts of the Mountain, and vomits forth its inward parts, as earth, stones, flames, smoke and ashes, throwing them up into the air with horrid noise, and with such force, that the <HI>Ve∣suvio</HI> seems to imitate the war of the Gyants, by fighting against <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI> and the Gods with flames, arms, and huge stones, (some where∣of four porters can scarce move) and seeming to draw the Sun down to the earth, to change the day into night, and lastly to cover the very heavens. Experience and the testimony of <HI>Strabo, Vitruvius</HI> and other antient Authors assures us, that under <HI>Vesuvio,</HI> aud the adja∣cent Maritimate Mountains, and of the neighbouring Islands, are vast burning sires, of sulphur, pitch, and allume: the hot bathes and <HI>sulphu reons</HI> boyling fountains sufficiently prove it: and therefore the <HI>Vesuvi∣o,</HI> when abounding with fire, sometimes asends &amp; sometimes useth to move earthquakes and vast ruins and destructions. That <HI>incendium</HI> was the greatest and most famous which happened under the Em∣peror <HI>Titus Vespasianus:</HI> described in a print by <HI>Dion Cassius,</HI> and other Authors, the ashes of which fire, were not only exported to <HI>Rome</HI> by the wind, but over the Seas into <HI>Affrick</HI> and into <HI>AEgypt;</HI> the Fish in the boyling Sea were dressed, the birds were suffocated in the air, and the famous and most antient adjacent Cities <HI>Stabia, Hercule∣ano,</HI> and <HI>Pompeo,</HI> were heaped and covered over with ashes and stones, while the people were sitting in the Theatre: and <HI>C. Plinius</HI> the famous Naturalist, who then governed and commanded the <HI>Armada</HI> of <HI>Misenus,</HI> too inquisitive after the cause of this inte∣stine fire, approached too near, and by the heat and savour received his end, by being suffocated near the <HI>Porto Herculiano: Francesco Pe∣trarca</HI> noting this acutely (in his triumph of Fame) saies he wrote much but dyed little discreetly.

<P>Yet for all, that to <HI>Pliny</HI> succeeded so fearfull his dalliance, <HI>Stepha∣no Pighino,</HI> himself not thereby fore warned, could not forbear, but took a voyage (of 30. yeers old) in order to his studies, into <HI>Italy</HI> through <HI>Campania</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> to the end he might search out, and be∣hold the place of such wonders, although very high, and no lesse

difficult to ascend which cost him an entire dayes labour. and with his two companions, he marched round the mountain, reaching the very top: where he could scarce satiate his view, in looking on the bourg, the Countrey round about, the Islands and the Sea: <HI>Vesu∣vio,</HI> riseth in the midst of a most fertile Countrey; the ashes scatte∣red over it, the stones and clods of earth burnt by the fire, and dis∣solved by the rain afterward, infinitely enrich and fructifie all the countrey; in such sort that the vulgar to purpose enough, call <HI>Cam∣pagna,</HI> the mountain and the Castle built at the foot of the mountain, <HI>Sommano</HI> from <HI>Somma,</HI> the sum and wonderfull abundance of gene∣rous wines, and excellent fruit; the <HI>Vesevo,</HI> as well as the <HI>Cam∣pagna,</HI> and neighbouring hills, being surrounded with fair vine∣yards.</P>
<P>So also <HI>Martial</HI> sung, that in his time it was green, with the sprouts of the vines, bewailing in his first book with a fair epigram that fierce fire, happening in <HI>Vespasians</HI> dayes: the top in all times and ages hath been ever held barren through the burned stones, as if eaten up by flames. Tis hideous to behold the deep cracks in the earth through which the streams of sulphur pass, but when arrived at top the <HI>Vo∣rago</HI> represents hell, so terrifying is the spectacle; Tis a hole about three miles compass and round, as if formed like the middle and lower part of an Amphitheatre, tis called <HI>Lazza</HI> from the form of the Rock Fish, the bottom of it reaches to the bowels of the Earth, The place is cold now, nor seems it to emit the least heat or smoak which the said <HI>Pighius</HI> testifies, who descended as far into that pro∣fundity as the the precipices and obscurity of the place would per∣mit; the first entrance of the <HI>Vorago,</HI> is fertile through the earth and ashes cast on it, and growes green through the firre and other great trees growing in it, as far as the Sun can reflect into it, or the rains penetrate; but the parts under, restrained to a narrow compass are as twere stopped by the great pieces of stone and rocks, and arms and bodies of trees fallen down: which obstructions, when the in ward Materials of fire abound, like little bundles of straw are easily raised and mounted to the skyes, by the invincible force of its smoake or flames.</P>
<P>The fire also is known to open it self a way, not only by the ordi∣nary mouth, but on other sides also, as occasion offers; whereof we have a memorial in the <HI>Italian</HI> Annales: To wit that two hun∣dred sixty and six yeers since, in the Pontificacy of <HI>Benedict</HI> the 9th. from one side of the Mountain gushed out a stream or river of flames which ran into the Sea, in a liquid fire like water: the issue and footsteps of which Cavern tis said appear yet: The <HI>Roman</HI> Histo∣ry tells us that besides the mouth, it had other issues and courses for the flames of old: for instance, it saies that <HI>Spartacus</HI> the sword∣player having begun to raise the war of the <HI>Fugitives</HI> against the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> in <HI>Campania,</HI> and having possessed the mountain <HI>Vesuvius</HI> with his army, as a strong fortress and sure retreat for war, and being there afterwards besieged, he escaped from the <HI>Roman</HI> siege by an admirable way: for that covertly fastning chains at the mouth of the Mountain, he with his companions let themselves down to the bottom: (as <HI>L. Florus</HI> briefly relates in his third book of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> history) whence issuing forth by an obscure breach, he at una∣wares

put to sack the quarters of the Captain <HI>Clodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s,</HI> and of the rest who were at the siege: who never conceived the least thought of it.</P>
<P>Whither at this day any <HI>subterranean</HI> wayes or caverns, leading from the Vineyards to the mouth of the Mountain, are found out▪ I cannot tell. <HI>Pighius</HI> assuredly tells us, that he observed at the top of the mountain about the mouth, certain vents, whence procee∣ded a continual heat: wherein putting his hand, he perceived clear∣ly a heat although small and without smoke or vapour: but our Country man <HI>Raymond</HI> observed in his view there, a certain hill ri∣sing in the midst of the <HI>Vorago,</HI> that still vomits thick smoke, which he saies the fire within hath raised within few years, that it dayly encreaseth, and when grown to a fuller bulk, <HI>Caveat Neapolis.</HI> Thus much touching the <HI>Vesuvius.</HI></P>
<P>Between the mountain <HI>Vesuvius</HI> and <HI>Attella,</HI> in the <HI>Mediterran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> are scituate, <HI>Mereliano, Acerra,</HI> and <HI>Sessola,</HI> at present ruinated, of old possessed by the <HI>Camps</HI> of the <HI>Leborini,</HI> where the <HI>Romans</HI> and the <HI>Samnity</HI> fought most fiercely: hither reach those mountains of <HI>Capua,</HI> called by the Antients <HI>Tisata,</HI> and those that extended to∣wards the <HI>Mole</HI> Northwards; here is <HI>Forche Caudino,</HI> and other Ca∣stles with many inhabited places, among which the chief is the Castle of <HI>Aciola:</HI> at the foot of these mountains lies <HI>Caserta</HI> the City and Country of the great Cardinal <HI>Santorino,</HI> called <HI>Santa Severina:</HI> near which lye <HI>Maddalone, Orazano</HI> and <HI>Argentino;</HI> Behind <HI>Tifata</HI> on the back of the Mountain is scituate <HI>Sarno,</HI> flowing with waters by means of the River <HI>Sarno,</HI> which there takes its rise: these are <HI>mediterranean</HI> places about <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Campana,</HI> whence you go to the <HI>Marca.</HI></P>

<P>THe Mountain <HI>Pausilippus,</HI> though very high is well manured with vineyards, and rich Townes also in old time as we col∣lect from <HI>Pliny</HI> and others; it extends into the Sea in form of a Pro∣montory, and shuts up the way between <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> and was an intollerable toyle to the Travellers to pass over or go round it, before twas cut in two; tis now by the industry of the passengers, through their hollowing it for the head, and levelling it for the feet become the mistress of waies, being strait, plain and easy: there∣fore the <HI>Graecians</HI> to the purpose by a word in their tongue called it <HI>Pausilippo,</HI> as if they would say a remover of troubles and labour: by which surname the <HI>Graecians</HI> of old called <HI>Jupiter,</HI> as we read in <HI>Sophocles.</HI> The mountain is hollowed within for one thousand paces in length, twelve foot wide, and as much more in heighth, on which as <HI>Strabo</HI> writes two Carts may commodiously meet and pass under earth: <HI>Seneca</HI> calls the cavern <HI>Cripta Neapolitana:</HI> though now the name is changed for <HI>Grotta,</HI> where he writes to <HI>Lucullus</HI> in the 58. epistle, to have run the whole fortune of the <HI>Atlesi,</HI> for that he found copiously in a part of the muddy way, implaistrings, and in the same cavern, abundance of the dust of <HI>Pozzuolo:</HI> we also have proved and tryed that dust, as others did. for we find that troops in the passage by foot or horse raise the dust, and that at our issuing out of that obscurity we were all yellow, and looking and laughing at one a∣nother we much wondered at it, finding a more then desirable in∣convenience; in cleansing our selves of that filth. The cause of which dust is easily known to proceed from the exclusion of the wind and rain, so that the raised dust (as <HI>Seneca</HI> saies) having no Vent falls down on it self, or on those that raise it: whence we collect that in the time of <HI>Nero</HI> this cavern had no Casements or breathings whereby it might receive air or light, more then at the entrance and end, because <HI>Seneca</HI> calls it a long and obscure prison, where nothing is to be seen but darkness. Yet <HI>Cornelius Strabo</HI> testifies, by the riving or chops of the Mountain in divers places, that many win∣dows gave it light, which being closed or earthed up, either through the earthquakes or the carelesness of the times, we may rationally imagine, rendred this longcavern so darksom. <HI>Pietro Rassano</HI> a <HI>Sici∣lian</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lucerie</HI> writes, that in his time, which we may count to be above 250. yeers since, this cavern was found without any holes, and without light, and that the entrance and the out-passage were so filled up with ruines and bushes, that twas terrible to enter without light: and that therefore the King of the <HI>Arragoni∣ans Alfonsus</HI> the first, having reduced this Province, enlarged and levelled the way and the entrance of the Caverne, and closing the top of the Cavern opened two lights, which obliquely enlighten it, whose reflection at a distance seems to the aspicients, snow scatte∣red on the earth: in the midst of this darksome way is a little sacred place cut in the walls of the mountain, where night and day a lamp perpetually burns, which puts the travellers in re∣membrance
<PB N="273" REF="151"/>
of the eternal light, and shews in a painted tablet our salvation, proceeding from the virgin Mother <HI>Mary:</HI> a Lampe per∣petually burns there, and the words at the Incounter are <HI>Alla Marina, Alla Montagne.</HI></P>
<P>In our times <HI>D: Pietro di Toledo,</HI> magnificently restored and ag∣grandized this work so worthy of eternity, being then gover∣nor of <HI>Naples</HI> Kingdom by the favour of the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the fifth: the way is now become so strait, that it seems to such as en∣ter the cavern, a Star, to which they ought to direct their course in the darkness, by means whereof, with what pleasure they behold all such as enter on foot or horsback at the other end, who seem like Pigmies at that distance, is scarce imaginable. Divers are the opini∣ons of the learned touching the time and beginning of this great work worthy of the mind of <HI>Serse:</HI> omitting the idle prating of the vulgar who attribute it to the magick incantations of the Poet <HI>Virgil,</HI> whose ashes by the opinion of many ly at the mouth of the Cavern: or of others who make one <HI>Basso</HI> the author, of whom there is no record among the antients: we beleive we may draw from <HI>Strabo, Eforus, Homerus</HI> and other greek writers, that the <HI>Cimmerij</HI> a most antient people dwelt in that <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Campania,</HI> between <HI>Baio, Lucerno,</HI> and <HI>Averno,</HI> and that they lay in denns and <HI>subterranean</HI> Caves, and that running the one to the other they dug out metals, and hollow∣ed mountains, and in profound Caverns exercised (by means of their Priests,) Negromancy and inchantments, conducting tra∣vellers, and pilgrims to the oracles of the infernal gods: which people being destroyed, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who succeeded them and built <HI>Cuma</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> accommodated as most suppose those Caves of the <HI>Cimmerii</HI> into hot baths, and baths, ways and other conveniences for humane use. So likewise the <HI>Romans,</HI> after the example of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> being chiefly enclined to great and magnificent impreses encreased these laborious under-ground structures, and at the time when they became the Lords of the world, they there erected their Palaces of Recreation, and Mannor houses little inferiour to Castles when the rare quality of the dust of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> was discovered (ex∣tracted from those mountains) to be very efficacious for binding, building, and establishing foundations of Edifices in the waters. <HI>Stra∣bo</HI> affirms that in his time <HI>M. Agrippa</HI> under <HI>Augustus,</HI> cutting up the wood on the mountain <HI>Avernus,</HI> which corrupted the air, among the other antique &amp; magnificent things found out a <HI>subterranean</HI> ca∣vern hollowed even to <HI>Cuma,</HI> the which as was conjectured, together with another between <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> was made by one <HI>Cocceio;</HI> and that in his time the custom of the Countrey was to make such underground waies and Caverns: from whose words we collect, that for a long time before <HI>Strabo,</HI> the <HI>Cocceian</HI> family were got toge∣ther in <HI>Campania,</HI> and that the place was called <HI>Spelonca</HI> though for truth we cannot set down any thing of certain of him that first made it: nor is it probable to me, that <HI>Strabo</HI> could be ignorant of the deeds of <HI>L. Lucullus,</HI> the which in those places were very great and of excessive expence, from which he was called <HI>Serse Togato,</HI> by <HI>Pompeius Magnus,</HI> by <HI>Tuberone,</HI> by <HI>Cicero,</HI> and the other princi∣pal men of <HI>Rome:</HI> wherefore their sence pleaseth me, who impose on him the concavating the <HI>Pausilipus</HI> for the conveniency of his
<PB N="274" REF="152"/>
<HI>Villa:</HI> because tis written by <HI>Marcus Varro, Pliny,</HI> and others, that <HI>L. Lucullus</HI> cut a mountain in the midst of <HI>Naples,</HI> with greater cost, then he expended in building his Manor house: for to what end should he? not to level and accomodate the way for passengers: but rather to open a gulfe of the Sea. whereby at his pleasure to ad∣mit and let in Sea water to his Fishponds that so the caves of the mountain might be a good receipt for his Fish (which he kept alive) to lye in as well in Winter as Summer.</P>
<P>At the outgoing of this Cavern, you perceive by little &amp; little the odour of brimstone in the air, which here and there proceeds out of divers vaults. By it lies the Lake <HI>Aniano,</HI> in similitude of an Am∣phitheatre surrounded and shut in on all sides by the Mountains, and through a mouth of a hill cut with iron great plenty of Sea wa∣tet, and great concaves, made ponds for Fish, at present filled with mud, sand, and ruines of structures: <HI>Leandro</HI> and others write from the relation of the peasants there, that in the midst of the Lake there is no mud: and that in the spring time, with great noyse &amp; fury fall down from the highest praecipices of the rocks there round in to these waters Knots of Serpents knit and bound together, which are never seen again to get out.</P>
<P>Near them are the sweating Rooms of <HI>Germanus</HI> vaulted: from under which, through the superficies rise vapours so hot, that who enters though naked, shall soon perceive a mighty sweat trickle down his body.</P>
<P>Wherefore those places are held of exceeding validity to such as suffer under the gout by purging the bad and malevolent humours, they heal internal wounds, and are helpfull for many infirmities of the body: which if any desire ampler satisfaction in, he may read the Tract of <HI>Gio Francesco Lombardo,</HI> who gives an account of all such as have writ in verse or prose of the baths and wonders of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> but we are obliged to too much hast, to relate with care and ampli∣tude all particulars wee meet with.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Campagnia</HI> of <HI>Pozzuolo, Baia, Cuma,</HI> and the near Island <HI>Ena∣rie,</HI> by the old <HI>Greeks</HI> called <HI>Pythecus,</HI> are found great quantity of the like Miracles, that it might be well beleived that there na∣ture serves <HI>Apollo</HI> perpetually, and <HI>AEsculapius, Higia,</HI> and the <HI>Nymphs:</HI> although the earthquakes, and the volleys of fire which frequently happen, demonstrate sufficiently that in divers places, that as well under the foundation of the Sea, as under the Mountains, and in the lowest parts of the Earth great fires are kindled, whose boyling vapours and flames working their own way through the veins of Allum, sulphure, pitch and other materials, cause to rise in divers places hot and boyling fountains, and create baths in the Caverns comodious for sweating. Yet the nature and faculty of these things are different, being conformed to the propriety of the materials and the earth whence the source proceeds: so that among the medicinal and healthfull faculty of these waters, we find some waters and vapours mortal, which issue out of some muddy earth, evil in it self. <HI>Pliny</HI> in the second of his natural Histories writes, that in <HI>Italy,</HI> and particularly in the <HI>Campagna</HI> of <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>vessa,</HI> and <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> are vents or breathings, so evil, that they evaporate a mortall air.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="152"/>At the foot of the mountain which circles the Lak <HI>Anianus,</HI> not far from the said waters appears a Cave called <HI>Grotta di Cane,</HI> eight or nine paces in circuit, by which mouth two or more men may commodiously enter together: where from the inmost part of the stone, from its invisible pores pro∣ceed hot spirits, but so subtile and dry, that they carry not with them any similitude of smoke or vapour, although they condense the air, driven thither by the wind and the colds of the Cavern with great heat, and change them into water, as the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ops demonstrate which hang at the entrance of the Cave, shining like little sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rs, when they are beheld at the opening of the Cave, by those without in the light: they have been often▪ taken for drops of quicksilver. All men generally believe this Grotta to have such an innate proper∣ty that if any living thing should pass the prefixed term of a cer∣tain ditch in the entrance, it would without doubt sudden∣ly fall upon the earth, and would be wholly deprived of life, if not immediately drawn out, and cast into the near standing waters or pool, called <HI>Agnano,</HI> by whose coldness only in a short time by lit∣tle and little it recovers Life. Whereof Travellers dayly make ex∣periments, if curious to know the wonders of nature, by casting in cocks or dogs or some other live creature to which they fasten a rope to draw them up by. <HI>Leandro Alberto</HI> writes that <HI>Charls</HI> the eighth King of <HI>France,</HI> when a hundred and 14. yeers since he drove out the Spanish and for some time Lorded over <HI>Naples,</HI> caused an Asse to be driven in, who suddenly whirled about and dyed.</P>
<P>Another who two hundred yeers since wrote of these baths, re∣lates, that a foot hardy rash Souldier, run in armed and dyed mise∣rably: <HI>Corona Pighio</HI> writes, that in the presence of <HI>Charls</HI> Prince of <HI>Cleves,</HI> the Spanish Captains cast two cheerfull dogs by force into the <HI>Grotta:</HI> who strove all possible to avoid it, as if they had formerly ex∣perimented the danger; the which being taken out dead, by means of the refreshing waters in the aforenamed Lake were restored to life: one of which being again cast into the cave, and being thence drawn &amp; cast into the Lake, returning not thereby to Life, was left for dead on the bank, who not long after as waking from a profound sleep raising himself, and limping and staggering, so soon as possible, ran away, every one that saw it smiled, and <HI>Charls</HI> praised the dog, that he would not for that time become a victime to the beares; after this tryal they cast a brands end lighted into the <HI>Grotta,</HI> beyond the prefixed sign, which come to the bottom seemed to extinguish, and raised up a little higher, to rekindle: which demonstrated that the spirits proceeding from the superficies, as more hot and dry in the bottom, consumed the more subtil nutriment of the flame, but having lesse vigour at more distance from the foundation, they rather rekindle the hot and gross smoke and flames of the brands∣end: as we see the flame of a lighted candle will pass to another newly put out, by means of the so oke; and the beams of the Sun when united by a burning glass, are very vigorous and will set tow or flax on fire if approached too near. <HI>Pighius</HI> through his exceed∣ing love to study, travialing over <HI>Italy,</HI> and having an extream desire to inquire into the nature of all things by which he might acquire knowledge, wondring at the reports of the miracles of <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="153"/>
resolved to search out the cause by a nearer scrutiny then had been made by others.</P>
<P>He could not beleive that those drops that hung so resplendent at the end of the Caverne, were quick-silver: wherefore being coun∣selled by a certain juvenile and youthfull audacity, he passed the proposed measure in the Cavern; having enclined his body a little and getting somewhat nearer, he found they were drops of clear water, and taking them on his finger from the sharp pendent of the rock, he demonstrated the truth to his companions, requi∣ring them either to beleive or enter and make proof.</P>
<P>Which also happened: for that <HI>Antonio Anistelo,</HI> and <HI>Arnoldio Niveldio,</HI> two <HI>Holandesi,</HI> noble youths and companions in the jour∣ney with <HI>Pighius,</HI> got near: who when he had for some time stood in the Cave, and perceived the heat, how it ascended from his feet to his leggs and knees, yet underwent no other then a giddiness and pain in his head; and sweat only on the forehead and the tem∣ples through the heat of the place: he learnt by experience that that heat, and those nocive vapours are not lusty and violent, but when near their rise; and there they kill small animals or great, but chiefly the four footed, because they alwayes go with their head downwards, whereby being necessitated to draw in with their breath those hot and boyling vapours, their vital spirits become suddenly suffocated with too much heat: the which also are as suddenly releived by the imediate refreshment of the waters in the Lake, if the animal be forthwith cast therein when drawn out of the Cavern. Whilst <HI>Pighius</HI> was performing this, an <HI>Italian</HI> who guarded some herds wondred strangely at his temerity, and remained astonisht at the success, many times demanding if he did it not by the magick art, nor would he be perswaded that <HI>Pighius</HI> could avoyd the nocivenesse of that <HI>Grotta,</HI> otherwise then by en∣chantment or witch craft: which made him mock at the <HI>plebeian</HI> simplicity, laughing at the vulgar, who for the most part attribute that to the Magick art, which appears wonderfull, and produceth stupendious effects, from their incapacity to comprehend the cause: but to return to our voyage.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Bucca Coronea,</HI> we are brought to <HI>Zolfettara,</HI> as at present they call those places which were of old celebrated with the inven∣tion of various fables of old Poets for these wonders of nature: who sing that the Gyants buryed under this mountain, even from hell cast forth of their throats, Flames at that time when earthquakes happen.
<Q><L>Et montes, scopulos, terrasque invertere dorse,</L></Q></P>
<P>These Mountains are full of Sulphure, Allum, and Vitriol, the chief whereof as <HI>Strabo</HI> writes, stood pendent at a few paces di∣stance from the <HI>Colonna</HI> of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> now distant from the castle <HI>Novo,</HI> about a mile: from the form of which place, tis guessed, that the top of this Mountain was at last consumed and emitted into the profundity of the near valley by the continual fires, whence that which of old was a high and eminent top or head, is now a great ditch in the plain of a valley and that which was of old the ribs and
<PB N="277" REF="153"/>
flanks of a mountain, are now the upper part of shelfs and rocks, which surround the plain, with a certain fence in length about a thousand and fifty foot, in bredth about a thousand foot: <HI>Pliny</HI> writes that they were nominated from their whiteness <HI>Leucogei,</HI> and the plain or Level, <HI>Campagna Phlegerea,</HI> from the flame and fire there ever extant: which <HI>Silius</HI> the Italian confirms.</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius Strabo</HI> calls this place the <HI>Piazza</HI> and shop of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> where likewise some fable, the Gyants to be overcome by <HI>Hercules:</HI> here the Mountains seem continually to burn at their roots: for that on all sides they emit smokes by many mouths which smell of sulphure which smokes are blowen by the wind all over the neighbouring Countrey, and sometimes to <HI>Naples.</HI> Antiently these Hills, as we draw from <HI>Dion Cassius</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> emitted greater fires, as also those about the <HI>Lucrino,</HI> and <HI>Averno,</HI> which are not a few, burnt and e∣mitted like furnaces gross smokes and flames. Now the plain as also the hill <HI>Phlegrei</HI> are deprived of their perpetual flames and are caver∣nous in many places and become yellowish, as from the materiall and colour of sulphure: the earth when spurned by the foot, re∣sounds like a drum, through its concavity underneath, where you may hear (with wonder) under your seet boyling waters, grosse and inflamed smokes to make a horrid noise, and run too and fro through the subterranean Caverns, which the force of the exhala∣tion hath made, which how great you may thence guesse; stop any of those mouths or holes, with a good great stone, and you shall suddenly and with violence see it amoved by the strength of the smoke. Here they compose medicinable pots of brim∣stone.</P>
<P>In the same plain or level lies also a great marish filled alwaies with a black scalding hot water: which sometimes useth to change place, and the waters making themselves hard (as tryed sewit useth being cold to bind it self to the sides of the Vessel tis melted in) do thereby and with the force of the exhalation increase or diminish. When I was there it boyled with great noise and smoke, as if it had been a huge chauldron filled with blackish mud, and therefore ex∣ceeded not then its bounds and limits: but I remember, that at my view thereof, this <HI>Vorago</HI> mounted and cast up of asudden like a <HI>Pyramides,</HI> eight or nine foot high, (beyond the common stature of man,) that thick water yellow and of the colour of sulphure: which also the people of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> affirm, adding that sometimes twill rise from sixteen to twenty four feet.</P>
<P>When the Sea is in a storm, this water is of various colours; though for the most part like sulphure, and sometimes other, accor∣ding as the subterranean winds are disturbed by the sea blasts, and being in vigoured among the flames, with all possible force expels some of the earth mixed with divers colours from the deepest veins. These very winds, when most quiet under ground, the top of the Fens or moors being only disturbed, cause a gross thick water, co∣loured with black to be cast out. These things of such occult na∣ture, do certainly afford usefull and welcome matter for considera∣tion and study to such as love to search thereinto; which <HI>Cicero</HI> ve∣ry pertinently terms, the natural food of the mind. And hence we certainly know, that the globe of the earth is not in every part so∣lid,
<PB N="278" REF="154"/>
and massy, but in some places hollow, cavernous, and full of vains and pores, like as is the living body of any animal: and that with the continual motion of the imbodied elements, water and air, it becomes penetrated, and is by the same nourished, increased or diminished together with its several kinds and changes of plants, and that the earth soops up vast quantities of the Sea waters, disperst on it by means of those pores, the which being encountred by some fierce winds, occasion a motion of those waters in its inmost part, and in the straitest passages; and the same winds there split in sun∣der among the rocks and stones, grow violently hot, and kindle vast fires, the which con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uming whatever they meet, empty the in∣ternal parts of the earth, and drawing to themselves through those pores the neighbouring winds, together with great smokes; they there augment beyond measure, searching out an egresse, with horrible noise and shakings of the earth and mountains.
<Q><L>Pellunt oppositas moles, ac vincula rumpunt.</L></Q></P>
<P>As more at large <HI>Cornelius Severus</HI> a most learned Poet hath decla∣red in his <HI>AEnea,</HI> and hence proceed the earthquakes, whirlpooles, and openings of the earth, the forcing out of flames, the rivolets of fire, boyling fountains, and hot vapours. <HI>Dion Cassius</HI> writes that in his time, the said Mountains of <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> had more fountains of running fire in the likeness of water, that through the excessive heat the water took fire and burnt, and the fires with the mixture of the waters acquired a fluxible corpulency, in such sort that these contrary elements, did not separate: and we find even in our time that the flames and sulphure, conserve and nourish them∣selves in these waters, and that they endure for so many ages and never consume, but alwayes continue and gush out in the same conduits, the which <HI>Severus</HI> the Poet graciously sets down in these verses.
<Q><L>Atque haec ipsa tamen jam quondam extincta fuissent,</L>

<P>So also he writes of the <HI>Phlegrean</HI> Fields and of the same place be∣tween <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Cuma,</HI> whereof we now discourse, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P>As at present the King exhausts a great toll from that brimstone, and merchandize of allum. Wee observe furthermore, that these sulphurious or brimstone waters commixt with the saltness of the Sea, and with the ashes of burnings, turn into stone after they have cooled themselves by running a short course: and that they communicate the same faculty to those rivers and brooks with which they commix, whereof though a clear experiment cannot be had, yet that innate quality in all the rivers of <HI>Italy,</HI> as the <HI>Tyb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>r,</HI>

Besides tis as clear as the Sun, and dayly observed that their continued washing of wood, plants, arms, bodies and roots of trees, the stubble of herbs, and the leaves by little &amp; little are covered with a kind of scurf of stone, and by revolving become by chance formed like comfits of ani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eeds, fennel, cinamon and almonds, and so much resembling such, that with no great diffi∣culty some more greedy then wary have been cousened with them: and in truth what <HI>Vitruvius, Seneca, Dione, Pliny,</HI> and others have writ of the wonders of <HI>Vesuvius</HI> and <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> seems beyond reason; to wit that the waters receive that nature and particularity from the tenuity of the ashes of the burned sulphure; which ashes the fire having in part reduced as small as atomes, in part dissolved in∣to liquid moisture, and in part expelled by the vapours of the sub∣terranean fires through the veins of the earth and by springs, we observe to be converted into that dust which the antients called <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> from the place; and that they unite so soon as they attain the waters, and cooling with them, attain the just substance of stone, and that the waters which run by those places mutually re∣ceive a certain nature of connexing to any thing, so that they easi∣ly cleave to the body they touch, and make it become stone,</P>
<P>And for wonders of this kind, scarce can any be found like those in the caves of the <HI>Apenines</HI> near the old chanel of the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iene</HI> by <HI>Vi∣co Varo,</HI> where the waters distilling through the clefts and chinks in the Rocks, in their fall by little and little form it self like stone, in the likeness of high Collumns in divers forms, branchy bodies of trees, and monstrous bodies of <HI>Centaures</HI> and Gyants; in which Caverns or labyri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ths of pure darkness, with candles may be found out objects which in one word, may worthily be said to feed and sa∣tiate the mind of the curious searcher into the secrets of nature: but beware that the light be not extinguished by the frequent flappings of the night bat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, who thither retire as to a secure retreat by millions to avoid the light of the day.</P>
<P>Thus beholding the hills <HI>Leucogei,</HI> and the various surges of me∣dicinal fountains, of baths, hot baths, and the Cavernes, you go to <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> amids the great and spatious ruines of the anti∣ent <HI>Colony.</HI></P>

<P>THe <HI>Roman</HI> Empire flourishing, that maritime tract of <HI>Campa∣nia,</HI> about <HI>Cuma, Misena,</HI> and <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> was in great reputati∣on for the temperature of the air, the pleasantness of the scite, the quantity of good waters, and the extream fertility of the fields, and therefore replenished with great possessions of the Gentry, and proud Palaces, of the principal men: And to speak truth, no other part of <HI>Italy</HI> nor of the Provinces, or the world, appears more proper for

the consumption of the <HI>Romans</HI> riches then that peice of <HI>Campania</HI> lying betweeen <HI>Capua</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> and extending to <HI>Cuma,</HI> where with good reason the common saying was that <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Ceres</HI> contended for superiority. the luxury and sensuality of which maritime places and Islands, made the old Poets in their antient fa∣bles of delights call these the house and habitation of the <HI>Syrenes:</HI> And this caused some old Poets and them of no small esteem to aver those things which happened between <HI>Ulisses</HI> and the Nymph <HI>Ca∣lipso,</HI> to have been acted in the Island of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> and not in <HI>Ogygia</HI> a place of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> or in the Island of the Promontory of <HI>Lacinio;</HI> which Goddess by some called the daughter of <HI>Atlas,</HI> by others of <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Tethys,</HI> was held a Nymph of the Sea, and reigned in the Isle <HI>Ogygia,</HI> ▪ receiving <HI>Ulysses</HI> when he escaped drowning; and took this name from her adornments of body, and delights she liued in: <HI>Homer</HI> calls her a Nymph very well adorned with fair riches: And in truth who considers the shores of <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> must in truth conclude that to his imagination, a more pleasant delightfull and glorious place cannot be found out than it, nor a Seat more inclined by nature to receive and carress Travellers; thence tis that the Po∣ets of old feign that <HI>Ulysses</HI> there fixing and dwelling, recollected his many past peregrinations and perils, and also in the Isle <HI>Ithaca,</HI> where∣of <HI>Dion Cassius</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hilostratus Lemnius,</HI> in the Life of <HI>Apollonius</HI> make mention. And although at present the whole is filled with ruines, and every thing lies even with the earth, through too intollerable sufferings by war and time, yet are there objects enow, which such as will reape any profit from the curiosity of the antient arts and hi∣stories, ought maturely and with great industry to consider. But to begin, <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> is a City scituate on a hill in the midst of a shore of the Sea, which though very fair and large, cannot yet be at all compared in any part with the riches and grandezza of the anti∣ent <HI>Colony,</HI> as may be clearly extracted from the wayes pitched with flint, and the foundations of publique edifices: whereof the Sea hath swallowed up one part, &amp; earthquakes and wars the other. It was a most antient Colony of the <HI>Graecians</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP>. the <HI>Samii</HI> conducted hither in the time of <HI>Tarquinius Superbus,</HI> in the sixty second <HI>Olimpiad,</HI> as the Chronologer <HI>Eusebius</HI> writes and <HI>Stephanus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ysantius</HI> confirms: which happened about the time that the republique of the <HI>Samii</HI> was ty ranized by the three Brothers, <HI>Policrates, Silus,</HI> and <HI>Pantagnostus.</HI> At that time also <HI>Pythagoras Samius,</HI> flying from his own Countrey in <HI>Morava,</HI> attained the potent City of <HI>Italy Croione,</HI> where he layed down a new Philosophy then called <HI>Italian,</HI> and by it acquired a high esteem: with whose Laws the <HI>Italian</HI> Cities (being reformed from the <HI>Graecian,</HI> by the indeavours of three hundred of his Scholars, as <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> writes) received the government of <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> un∣der which they lived happily for many Ages. Others will likewise that the <HI>Colony</HI> of the <HI>Samii</HI> from the observance of the Justice of the most holy Empire, wherewith it was governed was called <HI>Dicear∣chia,</HI> by which name all the <HI>Greek</HI> writers stiled, it and many times after their example, the <HI>Latin. Strabo</HI> writes, <HI>Dicearchia</HI> was once the Piazza of the <HI>Cumani,</HI> and that afterwards the <HI>Romans</HI> called it <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> either as some will from the many deep pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s, or as others from the sulphurious stenches of the waters there arising; It became

under the power of <HI>Romans</HI> in the warr with <HI>Hannibal,</HI> when <HI>Capua</HI> was taken by a seige, and severely chastised for the perfidie and ingratitude it exercised: from which was then taken its govern∣ment and liberty, and annually sent thither from the <HI>Roman</HI> peo∣ple a prefect to govern them, which happened the five hundred forty second yeer after <HI>Romes</HI> building: when many Castles and Ci∣ties ran the like fortune with it, for that they had with arms de∣fended <HI>Hannibal</HI> as <HI>Titus Livius</HI> sets down, wherefore <HI>Sextus Pompeiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> sets <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> among the ten Praefectures of <HI>Campania,</HI> on which the <HI>Roman</HI> People every yeer imposed Governors: for all which some yeers after, they passed farther by disposition of the <HI>Acilian</HI> Law, to with that they sent thither a Colony of <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens, and made it one of the five maritimate Colonies, which were drawn from <HI>Rome</HI> in the five hundred and fifty ninth yeer by force of the Laws of the said <HI>Acilius</HI> the Tribune, as is clear in <HI>Titus Livius:</HI> being then Consuls <HI>Publiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Scipio Africanus</HI> writes the second time, and <HI>Titus Sem∣pronius. Vellejus Paterculus</HI> from the opinion of some, that the Colony was later sent thither, to wit 3 lustres or 15 yeers after the a∣bove written time, and addes that in sum the verity is not punctu∣ally known.</P>
<P>Yet verily the old memorials of <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> copious enough in the house of <HI>Hadrianus Guilernus</HI> the most courteous, learned, and curi∣ous beyond measure in antient histories, wholly agree with <HI>Titus Livius:</HI> where is extant one of those stone Tablets, containing the second Law, the Regulation of publick edifices and expences there to be had: which was made in the <HI>Consulacy</HI> of <HI>P. Rutilius</HI> and <HI>Cn. Mallius Maximus,</HI> the six hundred forty and eight yeear as the <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ti Capitolini</HI> demonstrate, which happened in the ninth yeer after the conduct of that Colony to <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> as these words set down on the beginning of the said Law clearly prove.
<Q>Ab Colonia deduct a anno XC. N. Eufidio N. F. M. Pullio Duum vir R. Rutilio. Cn▪ Mallio Cos. Operum. Lex. II.</Q></P>
<P>From which words we clearly comprehend, that the comence∣ment of this Colony was under the Consulacy of <HI>Martius Portius Cato</HI> and <HI>L. Flaccus,</HI> in the five hundred forty eighth yeer, although <HI>Livius</HI> sets it down to have been the following yeer. <HI>Augustus</HI> being at last become Conqueror in the Civil wars, having restored peace, and shut up the Temple of <HI>Janus;</HI> for reward of the veteran Soul∣diers, disposed them into the 28 Colonies of <HI>Italy,</HI> among which <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> was one, then made a military Colony, as <HI>Suetonius</HI> writes and as may be drawn from the fragment of the Military Colo∣nies.</P>
<P>From the above written observations is certainly known, how an∣tient the Colony of <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> is, and that many times Inhabitants were thither sent and inrolled. And therefore this Author holds for very imperfect, and ill treated from the insufficiency or inobser∣vancy of the remembrancer, what <HI>Tacitus</HI> sets down in the fourteenth book of his Annals: and so <HI>Justus Lipsius</HI> thinks also, for in the acts
<PB N="282" REF="156"/>
of <HI>Rome</HI> in the eighth hundred and twelfth yeer, the Emperor <HI>Ne∣ro</HI> and <HI>Cossus Lentulus</HI> being Consuls, we find these words of <HI>Taci∣tus. At in Italia vetus oppidum Puteoli jus Coloniae, &amp; cognomentum a Nerone adipiscuntur,</HI> adding no more as if <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> for no preceding time had the quality of a Colony, whereas <HI>Titus Livius</HI> clearly proves it to have been in that condition two hundred and forty yeers be∣fore: but these two may be easily reconciled, by the adjusting of one single word, to wit the writing it <HI>verus</HI> instead of <HI>vetus:</HI> in these words. <HI>At in Italia verus Oppidum Puteoli novum jus Coloniae, &amp; coguo∣mentum a Nerone adipiscuntur:</HI> for that being at first called <HI>Colonia Augu∣sta,</HI> with <HI>Nero</HI> it was called <HI>Augusta Neroniana,</HI> and thence tis that <HI>Tacitus</HI> saies that <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> obtained a new condition with a new name: but <HI>Tacitus</HI> not explaining the occasion why then a Colony was sent thi∣ther, or who gave it new condition, and what that condition was, the place seems to want more then one word: and because the particle <HI>At</HI> separates the word afore specified and the difference of things and the particle <HI>non tamen</HI> is placed in the midst of the peri∣od which followes, this place is therefore believed defective and that therefore these words set a cloud before the eyes, and scruples in the studies of the curious, which this Author hath thought not easily removable without some supplement to that place of <HI>Tacitus</HI> to the effect following, <HI>viz. At in Italia verus Oppidum Puteoli novum ius Coloniae, &amp; cognomentum adipiscuntur aequè cladem passi: Queis ir∣rit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>m Principis beneficium facere Coloni ex diversis legionibus undecunque coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ti, numero licet frequentes, ut veterem Tarentium, &amp; Antium ad∣scripti, non tamen infrequentiae locorum subvenere, dilapsis pluribus in Provincias, in quibus stipendia expleverant:</HI> And thus will the diffe rence be known between what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ell out to <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> and what to <HI>La∣odicea,</HI> by the copulation <HI>At:</HI> of which Cities this returned to its proper state by its own power, the other not, although it assisted the Prince, as did happen to <HI>Tarento,</HI> and <HI>Antio,</HI> the occasion of which misfortune <HI>Tacitus</HI> gratiously declares.</P>
<P>The learned are intreated to have due consideration of this place and to note the defects with a <HI>stelletta.</HI> To return then to our first purpose: the Author when he copied out those in scriptions, whi∣lest there permanent, it occurred to him, that a Colony was of new conducted to <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> under the Empire of the <HI>Vespasiani,</HI> and was called <HI>Flavia,</HI> for that he espied among those old stones, a great square marble one engraven with letters of a foot long a piece, the which by being continually exposed to the surges of the Sea, hath its characters almost eaten out, yet not so wholly but that one may read the third part of the elogy inscribed in the old Marble Arch, the which the <HI>Flavian</HI> Colony erected to express a gratefull sence to <HI>Antonius Pius Caesar</HI> for his liberality in restoring the ports: which part of the Elogy will hereafter be repeated.

<P>All Authors question who this <HI>Calphurnius</HI> the Son of <HI>Lucius</HI> was, chiefly for that there were so many <HI>Calphurnij,</HI> and they famous in the time of <HI>Augustus:</HI> and if it be lawfull to make use of conjecture none comes nearer then mine, that <HI>L. Calphurnius</HI> Son of <HI>Lucius</HI> called <HI>Pisone Frugi,</HI> after he had been <HI>Consul</HI> and Prefect of Pro∣vinces, was also Prefect of <HI>Rome,</HI> after <HI>T.

Pisone</HI> must have been his Father, of whom the eloquent tongue of <HI>Cicero</HI> speaks so much ill, as that he was banished whilst he was Consul. He was then Censor in the seuen hundred fifty and third yeer, whilst <HI>Caesar</HI> Dictator warred against the confederates of <HI>Pompey.</HI> Among all the greatest charges and employments which the <HI>Calphurnian</HI> fa∣mily participated, they only twice administred▪ the Censorship. The first time <HI>L.

<P>This Temple is so well built, that in the space of so many ages neither Time the consumer of all things, nor the insolencies of e∣nemies, who have many times destroyed the rest of the City, have been able to ruinate, which could not come otherwise to passe the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> from the beams being composed of marble, in which scarce a fastning appears: yet the impetuous force of the earthquakes have in part moved it out of order, in such sort that the right angle of the Frontispiece is faln with a part of the Title, where certain ruptures appear.</P>
<P>Of such esteem was this Fabrick, that the architectors were not a∣shamed the work being finished to place their name there: being <HI>Luccio Cocino Liberta of Luca,</HI> and <HI>Caio Postumi,</HI> as we read in the left wall of the Church in these words.

<P>Many other holy sacred places that were therein are either faln to nothing▪ or at least wise very badly handled.

<HEAD>The Temple of the <HI>NYMPHES</HI> extant on the Sea Shore without <HI>POZZVOLO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT seems very likely that either the Sea or Earthquakes have swal∣lowed up the temple of the <HI>Nymphs,</HI> the which, we read in the 8th, Book of <HI>Philostratus Cennius</HI> in the life of <HI>Apo lonius Tianeus Do∣mitianus</HI> the Emperour built on the sea shore without <HI>Pozzuolo:</HI> he writes that twas built with white stone, and that of old twas fa∣mous for divination, and that in it was found a fountain of running spring water, from the which though any quantity were taken a∣way, twas never perceived to diminish; but this with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nfinite other antiquities is now gone to nothing; yet now is evident at a little distance from the Land near the <HI>Via Campana</HI> in the Sea a fountain of sweet water, which gurgles to this day with great force; whose source may be alwaies perceived almost to admiration, if the Sea be quiet and calm: let the studious of antiquity consider if in this place the Temple of the <HI>Nymphes</HI> may have been, which conjecture will not seem far from truth upon weighing the words of <HI>Philostra∣tus,</HI> who relates, that <HI>Apolloneus Trineus</HI> appeared to his two D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sciples <HI>Damides</HI> and <HI>Demetrius</HI> was in the Temple of the <HI>Nymphes</HI> on the Sea shore without <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> who were disputing the nature of the a∣bovenamed fountain, where also is the Island of <HI>Calissus</HI> to whom the successes of what happened with <HI>Ulisses</HI> they relate in the fa∣bles.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as twere in the midst of the <HI>Colony,</HI> remains yet a most huge Amphitheatre little lesse then entire, composed of squared stones, the which not withstanding its ill treatment by earthquakes the taking away many of its stones, and the plowing of its soyl, yet appears in its first form, enlarged into a more l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rge circuit, then was usual for the Emperors, &amp; <HI>Leandro Alberto</HI> saies that by measuring he found it to be in length in the plain within, 172 foot, in bredth only 92. foot.</P>
<P><HI>Ferrante Loffredo</HI> Marques of <HI>Trevico</HI> affirms, this the most antient Amphitheatre, supposing it to be built before <HI>Rome,</HI> lost its liber∣ty

<P>Many fragments of Acqueducts are yet to be seen, which either passed through or surounded the Mountains: nor is it an easy mat∣ter to number the conserves for the waters made in divers formes, some entire, and some ruinated by earthquakes, many of which are under ground and very large, which who enters, without a clue of thread, a light, or a well practised guide, may dwell there for ever, so intricate are the labyrinths, built without gates, heads or turning streets: from which we may assuredly know, that the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> with vast expence thither drew, and therein preserved great plenty of those sweet waters, abounding on that Maritimate coast. The vulgar unskilled in old history, as in all things very ignorant, have most injuriously expressed themselves, in giving ridiculous names to these edifices, calling them, <HI>Piscine mirabili,</HI> wonderfull fishpools, <HI>Cento Celle,</HI> the hundred Cells, and <HI>Grotte Draconarie,</HI> Dra∣gons Caves. Soe also have they handled the fountains and baths in number forty or more between <HI>Pozzuolo, Misseno</HI> and <HI>Cuma,</HI> of di∣vers sorts, and efficacious for sundry diseases. But tis not our pur∣pose to look back and take notice by one and one of these things, having already set forth whatever is there rare and worthy view; we shall therefore referre such as desire more ample and compleat satisfaction in the like objects to <HI>Leandro Alberto,</HI> and the other wri∣ters herein before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>The description of the Antient Port of <HI>POZZUOLO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUch and so great wonders, as here by degrees present themselves to the view of the Traveller as he approaches the Sea side, may well entertain him; for like mountains in the waters rise the im∣mense moles of the old Port, that is, thirteen immense Piles, which spring out of the water like square Towers, which in old time were conjoyned in manner of a bridge by frequent arches, but now by fortune and antiquity those gross engines are separated, and the falling down of some of the Arches renders it unpassable from one to the other: which must have been caused either from earthquakes or the furious Sea, the whole fabrick being composed of burned earth like bricks of two foot square, not easily to be divided and broke down by any other accident.</P>
<P>Tis certainly known, that when this Port was in being, it exten∣ded it self into the Sea, in form of a large bridge, and bending it
<PB N="286" REF="158"/>
self in the fashion of a bow, reached the shore and the <HI>Avernus,</HI> and so defended the place from the raging force and storms of the Sea, whose haughtinesse was comodiously bridled by means of those Moles.</P>
<P>And tis believed that the Antients there made those Arches, to the end that through them the sea waters might enter into the Port, and by its continual flowing and ebbing keep it clean∣sed of the mud, which the rivers and rain waters brought down in to it from the <HI>Terra firma</HI> and the neighbouring hills, through which in their course to the Sea those waters must first passe; and it had not been possible to avoid the filling up of that port in few yeers, by that perpetual inroad of durt, had not the Sea waters through those Arches continually purged it of that mud and filthi∣nesse so drove into it: and this the inconvenience in the port of <HI>Naples</HI> and divers others, who are only surrounded with a bank with∣out arches, sufficiently proves.</P>
<P><HI>Suetonius</HI> in the life of <HI>Caligula</HI> from its vastnesse calls it the Mole of <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> from whence thorough the midst of the Gulf of the Sea, <HI>Caligula,</HI> as he writes, to shew his greatness and vanity, and to be able to tread and walk on the Sea as well as upon the Land; or as <HI>Dion</HI> saies because he would imitate King <HI>Xerxes,</HI> who passed his Army out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Europe</HI> over the streight of <HI>Hellespont</HI> upon a wooden Bridge: commanded to be brought together and new built all the ships he could get, which were infinite, and therewith caused a Bridge to be made with the said Ships set in two Banks fastened and moored together with anchors chains and cables, which made them stand fixt and firm, and extended even to <HI>Baias</HI> through the gulf of the Sea: he commanded this bridge to be made of boords so strong and even and to lay so much earth upon the same, as it seemed to be firm ground and one of the streets of <HI>Rome</HI> like the <HI>Strada Appia.</HI> This being finished, he proudly attired in Robes of Gold and pearl, and a crown of Oaken boughes on his head (called <HI>Civica,</HI>) on horseback entred at one end of the bridge and road to the other, accompanyed with the Band of the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Souldiers, and all the Nobles and Gentlemen of <HI>Rome:</HI> and the next day re∣turned habited like a <HI>Campanian,</HI> in a Chariot, with a great multi∣tude of his Friends. <HI>Dion</HI> writes that the night he lay on this bridge, he caused such an infinite number of Torches, lanthorns and other Lights, to be lighted and set up, that the clearnesse thereof did exceed the darknesse of the night: <HI>Caligula</HI> boasting, that he had made of the night day, and of the Sea Land; &amp; because it happened that these two days the Sea was calm, he said that <HI>Neptune</HI> did it for feare &amp; to do him Reverence; <HI>Suetonius</HI> adds, that <HI>Caligula</HI> having in∣vited many, who being on the shore ready to goe on the Bridg where himself was, he turned them all over, breaking the bridg, and com∣manded some that endeavoured to catch hold of the ropes of the Vessels, to be forced into the water with oars and other staves, which served for a jest and pleasant spectacle to this Monster: <HI>Seneca</HI> in his 78th.

The <HI>Piscina Mirabili</HI> or Pool for water was admirable and famous, and known by this name, the which is yet almost entire on the back of the Promontory of <HI>Miseno,</HI> toward the Port for the Navy, and <HI>Cuma.</HI> This Fabrick <HI>Le∣andrus Albertus</HI> affirms, is inclosed by four walls, is five hundred foot long, and two hundred and twenty broad: and the Vault some∣what higher: raising a little archwise from the walls, it riseth high∣er towards the middle, being supported upon forty eight columns, each of which is three foot square, which being disposed into four ranks represent a beautifull and proportionable object for the whole length. The whole Fabrick is composed of brick, and the walls being of a great thicknesse, render it of an extream firmnesse; both the Walls and Pillars with in are exactly incrusted as useful to keep them from leaking: and in the arch are many open ovals for drawing up the waters: at each end were forty steps for descent to the very bottome. The Pavement on the sides is higher even to the midst of the Porticue: whence was a descent by fiue steps into a lesser chamber on each side, and thence was a descent into ano∣ther very narrow inclosed place, into which tis supposed the waters purged their filth and uncleannesse, the which was afterwards ex∣haled by the publique officers for this purpose called <HI>Castellarij,</HI> from these conservatories of waters being denominated <HI>Castella</HI> in Latine.</P>
<P>All the Pavement is <HI>Terras</HI> beaten, with all art and diligence, so that to this day it holds the rain water like a dish in the lowest part of it.</P>

<P>The Palaces were wont to be very pompous in those parts on the <HI>Maritime</HI> coasts, being 150 miles in length: Which was so filled with Palaces, Cities, Towns, Burghs, Baths, Theatres, and such other proud and magnificent Fabricks, beginning at <HI>Baia,</HI> and so continuing to <HI>F.

<HEAD>The <HI>Villa Academica of Marcus Tullius CICERO.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> in the second Chapter of his thirty first book declares, that the <HI>Villa</HI> of <HI>Cicero</HI> (made so famous by his writings) was in these quarters between the <HI>Avernus</HI> and <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> upon the Sea shore with a
<PB N="294" REF="162"/>
most delicious grove and a spacious hall to walk in, wherefore <HI>Cicero</HI> called it an Academy in imitation of that at <HI>Athens,</HI> wherein they ordinarily disputed walking. Here <HI>Cicero</HI> made his sepulchres: and so much was he pleased with it, that he often spoke of it, and enti∣tled some of his books from it, <HI>Questiones Academicae:</HI> Academick questions. <HI>Atticus</HI> being in <HI>Athens, Cicero</HI> in almost every letter re∣commended his Academy, that he might send to him from <HI>Greece,</HI> whatever could be had for ennobling it with fair ornaments, where∣in <HI>Atticus</HI> failed not, according to the occasions, in statues, pictures and other the like ornaments. Whence <HI>Cicero</HI> in his Epistle <HI>ad Atti∣ticum,</HI> praiseth his diligence and the things sent him.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> being retired hither in the calamitous times of the Repu∣blique to spend away the time, toyl, and troubles with Books, many of the Principal Romans repaired thither to visit him, and take some counsel. Of them was <HI>C. Caesar</HI> after the victory he obtained in the civil warr, <HI>C. Octavius</HI> the Successour of <HI>Julius,</HI> yet before he made himself Emperour, with infinite others: but after that <HI>Cicero</HI> was banished, the <HI>Villa Academica</HI> was possessed by <HI>C. Antistius,</HI> who was the Legat of <HI>Caesar,</HI> and followed his faction in the civil wars. A little after <HI>Ciceroes</HI> death, in his <HI>Villa,</HI> sprung up fountains of hot water, good among other things for the eyes and sight, celebrated by <HI>Tullius Taureus</HI> the freeman of <HI>Cicero,</HI> with an Epigram set down among the works of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who wrote this successe, and judged that Epigram worthy of memory. We must believe that this <HI>Villa</HI> stood where now the <HI>Stadio</HI> is, taking that name from the length of <HI>Ciceroes</HI> hall, whose ruines yet remain so distinctly, as that it may be measured how long twas: and although this <HI>Stadio,</HI> seem to stand too far from the Sea, in respect of that we read touching <HI>Ciceroes</HI> Academy, yet this will not create any difficulty: since the Sea may be in so long a space of time through divers causes retired; because truely this <HI>Vil∣la</HI> in <HI>Ciceroes</HI> time stood over water, at leastwise conducted from the Sea, by certain channels, so that he eating at table, might cast into the waters for the fish to eat, &amp; angle and fish at his pleasure. The hot fountains are extant in a neere field, in a cavern underground at the root of the hill, which are also of wonderfull nature, because they increase and decrease according to the flowing and ebbing of the sea, by day and by night: in their increase they cast abundance of water into the bath, and when full, part of the water returns to the fountain, and part runs into the Sea by a certain small chanel or gutter made to that purpose.</P>
<P>This Bath vulgarly called <HI>Bagno Ciceroniano,</HI> the <HI>Ciceronian</HI> bath, and by phisicians, <HI>Praetense</HI> or <HI>Tritulliano</HI> is as gallant and entire an antiquity as any in the Tract of <HI>Pozzuolo:</HI> These waters were so soveraign not many years since over most diseases, that over every bath was written for what cures twas good, of which inscription some letters yet stand: but the phisicians of <HI>Palermo</HI> (as they tell the story) finding those waters prejudicial to their custom, went with instruments expresly &amp; demolish't those writings (so that for the present they are unusefull) the said phisicians being all cast away in their return. Thus much shall suffice touching <HI>Ciceroes</HI> famous <HI>Vil∣la,</HI> for that <HI>Leander</HI> and other writers treat sufficiently of its nature and others thereabouts.

high hills, clothed of old with thick and heavy Trees capable to keep out the wind.</P>
<P>Whence the Lake was not frequented by any, but emitting an unwholsome sulphurous stink, it so infected the air above it (by be∣ing so closely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by mountains and woods) that Birds flying o∣ver it fell down dead: and thence twas named by the Latins <HI>Aver∣nus,</HI> that is to say, without Birds. So also may we collect from <HI>Livy,</HI> that in old time this Vale was a horrid place and esteemed altogether inaccessable: for saith he, the <HI>Romans</HI> waging war against the <HI>Sam∣niti,</HI> the enemies (when the <HI>Romans</HI> put them to flight) by whole Armies retreated into the Woods in the said Vale, as to secure places.</P>
<P>But <HI>Strabo</HI> writes not so of it in his time, but saies, that then this vale and nearer hills were delitious places, in respect <HI>Augustus</HI> had caused the woods to be felled, and a free passage opened to the air. At present the Lake is full of fish and water-foul, nor hath it any of those incommodities attributed to it by the antients. Yet tis true that not many ages since, a vein of sulphurous pestilential wa∣ter gushed out of the bottome of the Lake, which suddenly killed a world of fish, their colour and smell (being cast on the earth) con∣firming that to be the cause of their death. <HI>Joannes Boccaccius</HI> in his little tract of Lakes, saies he saw it with his own eyes in the time of King <HI>Robert,</HI> about the yeeer 1380.</P>

<P>These people lived a long time governing their Republique with prudence, and increased so much, that <HI>Pozzuolo, Paleopoli,</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> became part of their Colony: we read that the <HI>Cumani</HI> were under Tyrants, before the Romans expelled their Kings, but this hap∣pened not through their being subjugated by any, but because they chose to themselves a head and chief to obey, who after the Greek manner, was called <HI>Tyranno,</HI> that is, Lord, one of which was <HI>Ari∣stodemo Malaco,</HI> elected for his meer valour, as <HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</HI> write: for that with a small party, he overcame a great nnmber of <HI>Tuscans, Ombrians</HI> and <HI>Ausonians,</HI> enemies of the <HI>Cuma∣ni,</HI> and slew with his own hand <HI>Arunte,</HI> the Son of <HI>Porsenna,</HI> their Captain.

<P><HI>Soli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> by authority of <HI>Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>odotus</HI> saies that twas built by <HI>Praenestus</HI> the Son of <HI>Latin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> and Nephew of <HI>Ulisses: Plutark</HI> in his parallels by authority of <HI>Aristotle</HI> in the third of <HI>Italian</HI> things saies, that <HI>Telogonus</HI> the Son of <HI>Ulisses</HI> by <HI>Circe</HI> the witch, after he had built <HI>Tusculum,</HI> by advisement of the Oracle called it <HI>Preneste</HI> from the name of the Crowns wherewith he first saw the Inhabitants of the Country to daunce: but be it as some say from the said <HI>Praenestus</HI> or as others will from the scituation of the place, a little pendent, or as others from the scites being so high, tis indifferent, since the name <HI>Preneste</HI> will easily accommodate it self to all or either of these re∣spects.</P>
<P>Yet the more rational opinion for the name, seems to be derived from the Crowns aforementioned, not only for the aforesaid cause but also for that in that City there stood a most noble Temple of <HI>For∣tune,</HI> famous for those diviners by Lots, who exercised themselves in that superstition: and was therefore visited with many Crowns offered to the said Goddesse by vow: of which Temple some frag∣ments yet remain, and a few years since, were there found divers figures of Fortune, in brasse, brick, marble and other materials, as al∣so several Crowns, and divers medals, upon which were figured the various lots, fortunes, and chances, with their marks, signes, and letters.</P>
<P>In it also hung divers Tablets and other things offered by vow to <HI>Fortune, Jove, Hope,</HI> and to the <HI>Capudini,</HI> which things would take up too much room to recite, yet one Epigram will not be too impertinent, since so eminently inscribed on a marble basis, dedicate in that Temple by <HI>T. Caesius Taurinus,</HI> with the figure of <HI>T. Cesius</HI> the
<PB N="307" REF="168"/>
first his Father, the most famous Merchant of Corn, who used every yeer to present a hundred Crowns by vow. On the said Basis are car∣ved two measures, called <HI>Modii,</HI> half bushels filled with ears of corn, on the sides are some little pillers crowned with ears of corn, and in the middle is the ensuing Epigram.

<P><HI>Cicero</HI> declares in his second Book <HI>de Divinatione,</HI> by extraction out of the Books of the said people <HI>Prenestini,</HI> how the observati∣on of Chances Lots or Fortunes came to have its beginning in that City: saying, that a certain nobleman of <HI>Pelestrina</HI> named <HI>Suffucius</HI> by frequent advices and menaces which he had in his dreams, was commanded to break out of a certain place a great flint stone, wher∣at all the other Citizens his Compatriots fell a laughing, but when the stone was broke, the Lots or Chaunces suddenly leaped forth engraven in antient Letters, which occasioned their honouring of Fortune in that place: and thence became the place by little and lit∣tle enclosed and shut up through respect of the Image of <HI>Jupiter</HI> there devoutly adored by the Matrons, in form of a boy childe sit∣ting with <HI>Juno</HI> in the lap of <HI>Fortune,</HI> in a posture as seeking out the breast and teat: and that at the same time, after the Temple of For∣tune was built, there dropped honey from an olive tree, wherewith by commandement of the Southsayers was made a chest, and therein those Lotts were reposed, the which were mingled and drawn out by a litle boyes hand when ever they would see the issue of any thing: as <HI>Fortune</HI> had at large directed her intention to be, that after this manner they should draw out the Lots.</P>
<P>This observation was most antient, and such as affirm <HI>L. Sylla</HI> to be the builder of this Temple deceive themselves. Which errour
<PB N="308" REF="169"/>
they took up from their reading the thirty sixth book of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who doth not say <HI>L. Sylla</HI> built that Temple but that he began to make its pavement with small stones of various colours in small figures, of w<SUP>ch</SUP>. pavement thus wrought, some yeers since certain parts were found under ground, and therein figured many forrein creatures with their names in greek.</P>
<P>It may then be rationally believed that <HI>L. Sylla</HI> being victorious in the civil warrs, after he had enforced <HI>C. Marius</HI> the younger to dye, and his other enemies who had saved themselves in <HI>Preneste,</HI> after a long siege took the City, killing some part and selling others of the Citizens: but repenting afterwards his impietie expressed against the sacred places, for expiation of that crime, he resolved to re∣store and embellish anew the Temple profaned and almost wholly destroyed by him. It seems a notable advise and observation to me, that the strength of the scite of this City hath occasioned its own destruction, which hath had a much contrary event in all other strong holds. The cause whereof is attributed to the assured confi∣dence of the strength of the place, for which cause in the civil warrs the weaker part ordinarily fled thither for safety: but their ene∣mies being stronger and more potent immediately layed siege to it, so that at the end if they surrendred not themselves the besiegers ruin∣ed the poor City: whence we read that in the following times of ci∣vil discord the <HI>Pelestrini</HI> that they might not undergoe so great mi∣sery as formerly they had done, abandoned their City and retired to their dwellings.</P>
<P>To this day appear there many subterranean waies from the Castle to the foot of the adjacent mountains, (besides the Caves used as conservatories for water) which were made for introducing of assi∣stance, or to fly the City occultly: into one of which <HI>C. Marius</HI> the younger having withdrawn himself, and perceiving himself to be beseiged on all sides, so that he could not fly, that he might not living fall into the hands of his enemies, agreed with <HI>Telesinus</HI> to run one against the other with their naked swords so to kill them∣selves: by which means <HI>Telesinus</HI> was slain, but <HI>Mvrius</HI> remained alive thorugh desperatly wounded, and soon after caused one of his Se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vants to make an end of his then begun death, by kil∣ling him. From which successes, the Inhabitants of the place be∣lieve the stones of those subterranean waies to be still red∣dish with the bloud spilt there: which yet is not so, for over all those hills are stones red by nature, and not through any accident of blood spilt thereon.</P>
<P><HI>Preneste</HI> was first a free City and confederate with the Romans, ha∣ving its own <HI>Praetor</HI> as <HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Festus</HI> declare calling her <HI>Municipal. Appianus</HI> saies that the <HI>Prenestini</HI> at the time of the Italian war were made Citizens of <HI>Rome</HI> with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iburtini;</HI> but some time after <HI>L. Sylla,</HI> victorious (as <HI>Cicero,</HI> speaks, in <HI>Catalines</HI> conspiracy) having emptied this City by slaughters and banishments, and deprived her of inhabitants by the many expulsions, slaughters and banishments he made of them, there remained so few inhabitants that he sent of the <HI>Romans</HI> to dwell there, dividing its Territory among the new comers, and thus made it a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony. <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> saies in the third Chapter of his 16. book that afterwards the <HI>Prenestini</HI> ob∣tained
<PB N="309" REF="169"/>
of <HI>Tiberius Augustus</HI> a restoration to their first state, that is into the condition of free Citizens, having the form of a Colo∣ny wholly amoved from their City.</P>

<HEAD>TIVOLI.</HEAD>
<P>WHen arrived at <HI>Tivoli,</HI> first go see those gardens which <HI>Hippo∣litus Estense</HI> Cardinal of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> planted with so much cost many yeers since upon the back of the mountain, together with a proud Pallace, which also is beautifyed with old statues, Pictures and royal houshold stuffe, even to the emulation of the greatness and magnificence of the Antients.</P>
<P>But who is able with sufficiency ever to display in words the ex∣quisite delights, costs &amp; pleasure, wherewith this place and palace is plentifully furnished? and who shall relate the Labyrinths, the Groves, the half circles, the triumphant Arches, the Arches laden with old statues, the Caverns of the Nymphs, and the innumera∣ble fountains which every where sprout forth waters, the close walkes, and beautifull arbours covered with trees, herbs, and tender branches and other like verts.</P>
<P><HI>Ubertus Folieta</HI> of <HI>Genoua</HI> heretofore described it most gratiously, But <HI>Corona Pighio</HI> cannot satiate himself with praising of it, who published descriptions of that Palace and the gardens in <HI>Rome</HI> stamped from brasse cuts, the view whereof in my opinion may draw as many persons to behold it, as <HI>Rome</HI> doth with all its wonders. Although we have scarce courage enough, yet conformable to that published Table will we cursorily describe it, for satisfaction of such as have not had the good fortune to see them, or at least their draught in picture. First then the Hill is levelled at top, and upon the plain thereon is erected the Palace, built of square stones with the grandure and magnificence of a Royal palace, and with ex∣quisite art and proportion.</P>
<P>On the right hand whereof lie enclosed gardens, called <HI>Secreti,</HI> and therein sixteen great marble Goblets emit clear waters, in the midst whereof sits a <HI>Janus Quadrifrons,</HI> with four faces, higher rai∣sed then those goblets, which makes four other fountains adorned like looking glasses: and on the right hand a Tennis Court, and other sumptuous places for exercise. The forefront hath between the win∣dows many old statues of Marble, as hath the first Porticue, from which lead two fair stone staire-cases up into the palaces.</P>
<P>Before this Porticue in the midst of a Piazza stands a <HI>Leda,</HI> which <HI>Leda</HI> was wife of <HI>Tyndarus</HI> King of <HI>Laconia</HI> with whom as Poets feign <HI>Jupiter</HI> accompanying, she brought forth two eggs, of the one whereof came <HI>Pollux</HI> and <HI>Helena,</HI> (ravished by <HI>Paris</HI>) of the other <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Clytemnestra.</HI> Thence the hill (a pleasant descent) is redu∣ced into four long Piazzaes and so levelled contains before the front
<PB N="310" REF="170"/>
of the palace four great and spatious gardens, into each of which at each end and in the middle, three pair of stone stairs (artificially composed) conduct by a facile descent, whose sides are bathed by divers purling streams, running towards their Lakes. Every garden is divided in its orders, hath places to sit in, and fair col∣lumnes erected in divers parts, so that such as go walking from one part to another, through places and passages covered over with leaves and vines, and other verts alwaies flourishing, enjoy a most beautifull prospect and no less sweet odours from the circumjacent flowers which make a pompous shew. In the appartments growes fresh grasse, which with the flowers by their variety wonderfully entertain the eye and fancy of whoever regard them, nor can any satiate himself in the view of those infinite and wonderfull statues, pillars, Fountains and other objects there presenting them∣selves.</P>
<P>The passage from the Piazza before the Palace on the right hand leads through divers walks, trees and small groves, wherein are placed several Fountains, as that of <HI>Tothyde,</HI> that of <HI>AEsculapius,</HI> that of <HI>Nigga,</HI> that of <HI>Aretusa,</HI> and <HI>Pandora,</HI> and that of <HI>Pomona</HI> and <HI>Flora.</HI> In the descent into the first garden, shews it self the <HI>Co∣lossus</HI> of <HI>Pegasus</HI> in <HI>Pamosso,</HI> a horse feigned to have wings, under whose shadow a fair Fountain casteth up her waters very high and in the wood &amp; rocks is a Cavern, and near them a statue of <HI>Venus</HI> &amp; <HI>Bacchus:</HI> near w<SUP>ch</SUP>. is a Lake, into which some rivolets run among rocks with a murmuring noise between two <HI>Colossus,</HI> one of the <HI>Sibilla Tiburtina,</HI> the other of <HI>Melicerta</HI> the son of <HI>Athamas</HI> and <HI>Ino,</HI> whom the Gen∣tiles did honour for one of the Gods of the Sea. Below which lye the statues of the Rivers <HI>Aniene,</HI> and <HI>Herculano,</HI> conjoined to certain vessels out of which some waters run into the Lake, as also out of the Urns, round which stand ten Nymphs. In the midst are two Grotts, the one of the <HI>Sibilla Tiburtina,</HI> the other of <HI>Diana</HI> the God∣desse of the woods, both which are adorned with fountains, sta∣tues, Curral, mother of Pearl, and a pavement exactly wrought with mosaick work. On the other side of the garden you have a fair prospect of <HI>Rome</HI> in a semicircle, round which appear her most memorable Fabricks; and in the midst sits <HI>Rome</HI> in the habit of a war∣like Goddesse, between her seaven hills: this statue is of marble, big∣ger then a man, in shape of a Virgin in a short girt coat, with naked hands, military buskins, and a sword hanging in a belt from the right shoulder. Her head is covered with a murrion, in her right hand she holds a spear, in the left a shield: she sits as afore∣said in the midst of her wonders in the City and on every side ap∣pear her sacred Fabricks, as the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> the <HI>Capitolian</HI> Temples, the Circs, the Theatres, the Amphitheatres, the Collumnes, the Obelisks, the <HI>Mauseoli,</HI> the Arches Triumphant, the Pyramides, the Acqueducts, the Baths, the River <HI>Tyber,</HI> with the wolf and Twin Brothers pouring water into the City out of an urn; in the midst of which running waters, riseth an Island cut in the shape of a ship which bears on the main yard an Obelisk, and the ship seems to be laden with these four Temples, the Temple of <HI>AEsculapius</HI> in the poope, and those of <HI>Jupiter, Berecinta</HI> and <HI>Faustus,</HI> it beares in the prow.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="170"/>Thence descending to the lower garden, you find on the left hand in a semy circle called the great, a green grove, placed be∣tween certain Rocks amid which run fountains this may be cal∣led the residence for birds: for on the arms of the trees you see ma∣ny images of little birds singing more sweetly then the natural, who clap their wings as if alive, receiving their motion from the aire and the waters with miraculous artifice, by means of certain little reeds hid in the armes of the trees: sometimes to please the specta∣tors, they will make a screech owle to appear, and then on a sud∣dain as if the birds were sensible of fear, they are all silent, but that again withdrawn, in an instant they all begin their notes and sing most melodiously.</P>
<P>In the middle of this garden is a round standing water Lake, and in it a capacious vessel and a fountain named from the Dragons, which vomit out of their throats great store of waters, having trum∣pets in their hands which also emit plentifull waters, with a horrid noise imitating the sound of the trumpet. On the right hand lies the Grotto of Nature adorned with many statues, and in it an Organ with fair pipes, the which perform an harmonious consort of vari∣ous and artificial musick, by the motion of the waters.</P>
<P>The next garden is not only beautifyed by the fair fountains, but by the quantity of Swans, and fish preserved in their several stati∣ons separated with rare artifice. In the three greater fountains are certain Beacons, called <HI>Sudanti,</HI> and other boundaries round them, which cast water very high in such quantities, that in their fall they seem natural showers, refreshing the air, and cooling the earth making noise of waters in their fall, as if the winds were high, sprin∣kling and washing at a good distance. In the midst of these con∣serves you see the effigies of the great Father <HI>Oceanus</HI> placed in a se∣micircle like a Theatre, and in the middle thereof a marble chari∣ot like that of the <HI>Venus Marina,</HI> drawn by foure Sea horses, on which sits a great <HI>Neptune</HI> seeming to threaten with his Trident.</P>
<P>Lastly descending into the last garden near the rock, you find in one part a Fountain of <HI>Triton,</HI> and on the other a Fountain of <HI>Ve∣nus Clonina,</HI> and in the rest of the level besides the Pescheries, four Labyrinths difficult enough for any one to get out of thats once in, placed one by another in foure compartments amidst forreign plants. The entrance and outlet of these gardens, are embellisht with great Fabricks built of <HI>Tiburtine</HI> stone, with great expence. Thus much concerning the <HI>Villa</HI> of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> of Cardinal <HI>Hippolito E stense.</HI></P>
<P>The noble sepulchre of Cardinal <HI>Hippolito da Este</HI> in the Church will recompence your pains in the sight of it, being composed with marble of various colours, on it stands a great white marble statue of the said Cardinal of great cost and fair appearance. The Castle also affords many worthy objects, but what is more considerable, is the precipitous descent of the River; which falls with such noise and fury from high cliffs of mountains, that for the most part its vapours render the air foggie, and many times at a distance there seem to hang celestial rainbowes, cloudes being at most times over it. This River infamed by the writings of the antient, takes its rise at the mountain of the <HI>Trebani,</HI> and runs into three noble Lakes.
<PB N="312" REF="171"/>
which give name to the adjacent castle, called <HI>Sublaco:</HI> which Lakes <HI>Tacitus</HI> seems to call <HI>Simbrivini,</HI> saying in the 14th. Book of his Annals, that near them stood the <HI>Villa Sublacense</HI> of <HI>Nero</HI> in the confines of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> from which Lakes the <HI>Aniene</HI> running afterward through woods and mountains, falls at last in the plain near <HI>Tivoli,</HI> from high stones, with fury and noise, then it goes some space under ground, and at the foot of the mountain returns all again above ground, it runs through the three sulphurious veins, called <HI>Albule,</HI> from their white colour. Tis said, and <HI>Strabo</HI> confirms the water there to be medicinal in drinking or Bathing, and <HI>Pliny</HI> writes that they heal the wounded. Nor does the <HI>Albule</HI> only but also the <HI>Albunea</HI> above <HI>Tivoli</HI> consolidate wounds. Regarding the <HI>Campania</HI> of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> about the <HI>Aniene</HI> you will find huge stones encreased by little and little in long time by vertue of the waters running by, and in the bottome of Lakes there you'l find of hard stones generated by the same means.</P>
<P>In this confine are many footsteps of old edifices worthy contem∣plation: <HI>Tivoli</HI> having been a most noble City, and well Inhabited through the beauty of its scite, the goodnesse of its soyle, and the salubrity of the aire: which made it be surrounded with the fair Villa's, and Lordly houses of the rich persons of that Country, although now like <HI>Rome,</HI> and all <HI>Italy</HI> al∣so it lies waste and ruinated by the various warrs and successes which have destroyed it. Tis certain that Greeks were the builders of this City, but who they were is not certain, the writers of the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> antiquities not agreeing herein: yet the greater part say that <HI>Ca∣tillo</HI> was its founder, who some say was of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> and Captain of <HI>Evanders</HI> Navy. Others affirm <HI>Argiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> the son of <HI>Amfiardo</HI> the South∣sayer, after the prodigious death of his Father near <HI>Thebes,</HI> came by command of the oracle with his family and Gods (long before the <HI>Trojane</HI> warr) into <HI>Italy:</HI> and by the assistance of the <HI>Enotri, Abori∣geni,</HI> drove the <HI>Sic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>li</HI> out of that place, naming the Castle taken from them <HI>Tib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>re,</HI> from his eldest sons name. Nor does <HI>Pliny</HI> much disagree from this, though he does not wholly agree with it: for in the 16th of his natural History writing of the ages of Trees he saies, that in his time there stood 3 Holme Trees by <HI>Tivoli,</HI> near to which <HI>Tiburtio</HI> the builder of that Castle, had received augure to build it. But saies he was the Nephew not the Son of <HI>Amfiardo</HI> and that he came with his two Brothers <HI>Lora</HI> and <HI>Catillo</HI> one age before the <HI>Trojane</HI> warr, and that he there caused the Castle to be built, calling it after his own name because he was the elder, in which o∣pinion <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his <HI>AEneides</HI> seems to concur: but <HI>Horati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> on the other part calls <HI>Tivoli</HI> the walls of <HI>Catillus</HI> pursuing the others opinion: from which expressions we conjecture that the City <HI>Tivoli,</HI> was be∣fore <HI>Rome.</HI> Those of <HI>Tivoli</HI> held <HI>Hercules</HI> in reverence above the o∣ther idols, as Protector of the <HI>Graecian</HI> people, at whose festivity in∣finite people resorted thither.</P>
<P>In it was also a Temple for the <HI>Sorti,</HI> lotts or chances no lesse fa∣mous for their oracles then that in <HI>Bura,</HI> or in <HI>Achaia</HI> a countrey of <HI>Morea,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Pausanias:</HI> whence the Poet <HI>Statius</HI> saies, that such was the beauty of the place that even the <HI>Sorti Prenestini</HI> would have chosen it for giving their answers, had not <HI>Hercules</HI> first posses∣sed the place.</P>

<P>He calls the <HI>Sorti</HI> Sisters; for that good and bad Fortune were re∣verenced as two Sisters. Tis thought that Temple under the moun∣tain in the way of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> was that famous Temple of <HI>Hercules:</HI> but this people had another Temple dedicate to the same God, yet called <HI>Hercules Saxanus,</HI> as appears by the subsequent inscription found in a Piazza attaqued to a particular house.

<P>But we cannot conclude with certainty where this other Tem∣ple stood: yet many agree that twas called <HI>Hercules Saxanus,</HI> in re∣spect twas built with stone differing from the other greater Temple: just as the <HI>Milanesi,</HI> called one <HI>Hercules in Pietra,</HI> from the scituation of that Church in a stony place near them. Upon the stone ariseth a certain antient round Fabrick without covering, built wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>h marble in rare architecture of much esteem, which possibly might be the Temple of <HI>Hercules Saxanus:</HI> tis near the <HI>Cataracts</HI> which augments this suspicion; for that the Antients usually placed their Temples consecrate to <HI>Hercules</HI> near waters, long ports, and violent falls of waters, to the end that <HI>Hercules</HI> by them esteemed the Protector of the firm Land, might cause the water to continue in its limits, and not infest the country with inundations: the which <HI>Statius</HI> clearly shewsin the 11th.

<P>The tenth Sybil named by the Latines <HI>Tibuclina</HI> and <HI>Albunea</HI> by the Graecians <HI>Leucothea,</HI> was held in great honour in <HI>Tivoli</HI> in old time: for they adored her as a Goddess consecrating to her a wood a Temple and a Fountain called after her own name <HI>Albunea,</HI> from the whitenesse of its waters, above <HI>Tivoli,</HI> in that mountain where <HI>Fame</HI> saies she was born and gave answers to demandants: of whom <HI>Virgil</HI> speaks and <HI>Servius</HI> his Commentator, as also <HI>Horace,</HI> with his In∣terpreters.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND OF SICILIA OR SICILY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Sicilia</HI> is an Island of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, seated betwixt <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Affrick,</HI> but between the South and West tis separated from <HI>Italy</HI> by a neck of the sea. Its form resembles a ▵ in greek, for that it hath three corners, every one whereof makes a Promontory, which are <HI>Peloro, Pachino, Lilibeo,</HI> now called <HI>Capo del Faro, Capo Passero, Capo Boco. Peloro</HI> looks towards <HI>Italy, Pachino</HI> towards <HI>Morea,</HI> and <HI>Li libeo</HI> toward the Promontory <HI>Mercurio</HI> of <HI>Africk,</HI> and to speak accor∣ding to the aspect of the climes, <HI>Peloro</HI> lies Eastward, <HI>Pachino</HI> between South and East, <HI>Lilibeo</HI> between South and West. On the North this Island is washed by the <HI>Tirrhene</HI> Sea, on the East by the <HI>Adriatique</HI> and <HI>Jonian</HI> Sea, on the South by the <HI>African</HI> Sea, and on the West by that of <HI>Sardigna.</HI> It was called <HI>Trinacria,</HI> either from its three Pro∣montories or from the King <HI>Trinaco,</HI> son of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and <HI>Triquetra,</HI> or from the three points of the Triangle; and <HI>Sirania</HI> from the <HI>Sirani,</HI> and after that <HI>Sicilia</HI> from the <HI>Siculi,</HI> (descended from the <HI>Liguri</HI>) who beat out the <HI>Sicani.</HI> It is in circuit, as by the moderns is judged (setting aside the diversities of the antients) six hundred twenty three miles: from <HI>Peloro</HI> to <HI>Pachino</HI> one hundred and sixty miles, from thence to <HI>Lilibeo</HI> 183 miles, from <HI>Lilibeo</HI> to <HI>Peloro</HI> 211. Its length from East to west is 150 miles, but its bredth is not equal, though on the Eastern part tis 160 miles broad, diminishing afterwards in bredth by degrees, being most straite at <HI>Lilibeo.</HI> The head of all the Island is the Territory <HI>Ennese.</HI> It hath on the north side ten Islands which lie round it (the Antients numbred but 7) whose names are <HI>Liparce, Vulcania,</HI> or <HI>Giera, Vulcanello, Lisca-bianca, Basiluzo, Thermisia, Trongile, Didima, Fenicusa,</HI> and <HI>Ericusa. Sicilia</HI> is divided into three provinces, which they call <HI>Valli</HI> or Vales, that is into the <HI>Val di De∣mino</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="174"/>
or <HI>Demona;</HI> the <HI>Val de Noto,</HI> and the <HI>Val di Mazara,</HI> the <HI>Val di De∣mino</HI> commenceth from the Promontory <HI>Peloro,</HI> and is the shore on one side to the River <HI>Terria,</HI> and on the other to the River <HI>Hime∣ra</HI> which dischargeth it self into the <HI>Tirrhene</HI> Sea. The <HI>Val di No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o,</HI> begins at the River <HI>Teria,</HI> and with it extending it self inwards, and traversing <HI>Enna,</HI> it descends with the river <HI>Gela,</HI> and ends at the City of <HI>Alicata.</HI> But the <HI>Val di Mazara,</HI> comprehends all the remain∣ing part of <HI>Sicily</HI> to <HI>Lilibeo.</HI> This Island was some time conjoined to <HI>Italy,</HI> whereof the modern authors as well as antient render a large testimony, though there are some who take it for a ridiculous opini∣on. It is esteemed for the salubrity of the Ayre, the abundance of terrene sustenance and plenty of all things necessarie for mans use very excellent, as placed under the fourth Climate much more be∣nigne then all the others, whence tis that what ever this soyle of <HI>Sicily</HI> affords, either by its own nature or the Ingenuity of man is accounted next to those which are cryed up for the best. It produ∣ceth corn in such abundance that in many places it yields 100 for one. Wilde Oats grow there of themselves, as also the Vines, which gave occasion for the Fable of <HI>Ceres</HI> &amp; <HI>Proserpina.</HI> Their wines are most delicate, as is the oyle of Olives whereof they make great quantities. Their Canes too are admirable, called <HI>Ebosia</HI> hereto∣fore, now <HI>Cannamele,</HI> whereof they make Sugars. Their Bee hony is there so good that by the antients as a proverb twas used the <HI>Hy∣blean</HI> hony of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which affords great store of wax: the Bees using the very tronks of trees for their hives, there gathering ex∣cellent honey. Their fruits of all sorts, grow with much plenty and goodnesse; they gather all sorts of Plants and medicinal herbs, and their saffron is better then that of <HI>Italy,</HI> as are their roots of wilde palm trees, which are gustfull to eat. The mountains <HI>AEri</HI> are so plentifully furnished with sweet waters, fountains, fruitfull and pleasant trees, that they have many times preserved a great Army of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> when near famishing. Other mountains pro∣duce salt, as <HI>Enna, Nicosia, Camerata</HI> and <HI>Platanim,</HI> where they take out salt stones. There also are the Caves or Pits for salt made of the Foam of the Sea resting upon the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sts, but neare <HI>I ilibeo, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e∣pano, Camarino, Macanio,</HI> and other places, they take up the sea wa∣ter, put it into pits, and thereof make salt. They also draw salt out of other parts of <HI>Sicily</HI> from the Lakes, as near <HI>Pochino,</HI> (a wonderfull thing) what by the rain, and fresh waters falling from other foun∣tains, the Lake may be increased, in a little time, is dryed away by the Sun. They also make here great plenty of that silk which they draw from their silk worms. Nor is <HI>Sicilia</HI> lesse enriched by her Me∣tals and Mines, having Minerals of Gold, Silver, Iron, Allum: and on the banks of the River <HI>Acate</HI> grow pretious stones, as the Emerald and Agat stone, and the clear Bartina, which is whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e in circuit, and black spots in the midst, and in forms of several Creatures, as birds, beasts, men or any other, which they say is an Antidote against the biting of the spider or Scorpion. <HI>So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nus</HI> saies too, that twill make the Rivers stop, and that <HI>Pirrhus</HI> had one stone of this sort in a ring, wherein was engraven <HI>Apollo</HI> with his Scepter, and the Chorus of the nine Muses with their Ensigne, at <HI>Gra∣terio,</HI> they dig the <HI>Beril</HI> or Sea water stone in great plenty, and Porphi∣ry

stone, red and traversed with white and green stroaks. Here al∣so they take up the jasper stone being red, and varied with several clear green and white spots, which ennobles the stone. And in the sea of <HI>Messina,</HI> and of <HI>Drepano,</HI> there growes Corrals a sort of sea Plant much commended and sought after. <HI>Sicilia</HI> is likewise Famed for the Chase of the Goat and wilde Bore: for the fowling at Partridge and God wit. And all other sorts of Birds, and four∣footed beasts both for delight and profit are there in great plenty, beside the Falcon and other Hawks, which there are taken. The Fishing also is greatly abounding, particularly for the Fish called Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y Fish, whereof they take not only at <HI>Pachino</HI> (as the Anti∣ents wrote) but also at <HI>Palermo and Drepano,</HI> and in all the River which is washed with the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Sea, (this fish bears a great price in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June</HI>) as also of the sword fish particularly at <HI>Messina,</HI> which (tis written) they cannot take unlesse they speak Greek, and to say no more both the Seas and the Rivers abound with all sorts of excellent fish. They have also in divers places many baths of hot, cool, sulphurous and other sorts of water, usefull and ad∣vantagious in several Infirmities, but those are in the River <HI>Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ntina,</HI> near the Cities <HI>Sacra</HI> and <HI>Himera,</HI> are salt and un whol∣some to drink. We will not speak of the Fountains of sweet water that are found over all <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and many Rivolets accommoda∣ted as well for the life of Man, as the enriching their Lands by the overflowing. And to speak in brief, this Island is not at all inferiour to any other Province, either for its fatnesse or abun∣dance; but somewhat exceeds <HI>Italy</HI> in the excellency of their grain, saffron, honey, Beasts skins, and other sustenance for the life of Man; in so much that <HI>Cicero</HI> not improperly called it the Granary of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> said that all things grew there of their own accord, and therefore calls it the Isle of the Sun. <HI>Sicilia</HI> is likewise admirable for the fame of those things which told, exceed our beleef as the Mount <HI>Etna,</HI> &amp; <HI>Mongibello,</HI> who sending forth continual fires from its bowels hath not withstanding its head (on that part where the fire issues) deeply covered in snow to the midst of Summer. Not far from <HI>Agrigento,</HI> or <HI>Gergento</HI> is the Territory <HI>Matharuca,</HI> which with assidu al vomiting of divers veins of waters, sends forth a certain Ash coloured Earth, and at certain times casting out an incredible Mass of that Earth, the one and the other Fields may be heard to roar.</P>
<P>In <HI>Menenino</HI> is the Lake <HI>Nastia</HI> (called by <HI>Pliny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>fintia</HI>) where in three eddies you behold boyling water, which alwaies gurgles with an egregious stink, and somtimes spues up flames of fire: hither antiently resorted all such, as through their superstition were to be sworn to any thing. It hath likewise in sundry other places divers other Fountains of admirable Qualities and nature, for an ample account whereof the reader is referred to <HI>Thomaso Fazellio,</HI> to the end we may abridge our relation here. <HI>Sicily</HI> was inhabited by the <HI>Cyclopes,</HI> which is verified (besides what Authors affirm) by the bodies of immense bignesse and heigth, which in our daies are seen in the Grots, or Caves.

Antient wri∣ters attribute the following things to the invention of the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> the art of Oratory, the Bucolick or pastoral verse, dyall making, the <HI>Catapul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e</HI> a warlike engine, the illustrating of Pictures, the Art of Barbing, the use of skins of wilde beasts and Ryme. They are by nature suspectfull, envious, evil spoken, facil to speak Vil∣lany, and prone to revenge, but industrious subtle flatterers of Princes, and studious of Tyranny (as saies <HI>Orosie,</HI>) which at this day does not so generally appear.</P>
<P>They are more covetous of their own commodities or convenien∣ces then of the publiques, and reflecting on the abundancy of the Countrey, sloathfull and without industry. Antiently their tables were so splendidly furnished, that it became a Proverb among the Greeks, but now they follow the frugality of <HI>Italy.</HI> They are vali∣ant in warrs, and of uncorruptible faith to their King; beyond the custōme of the Greeks, they are patient; but provoked they leap into extream fury. They speak the Italian Language, but roughly, and without the least sweetnesse, and in their habits and other customes live after the manner of the <HI>Italians.</HI></P>

but it was much more illustrated for the first breath it afforded to the Saints <HI>Oliva</HI> &amp; <HI>Nimfa</HI> both Martyred for the Faith of Christ: &amp; <HI>Antonio</HI> called the <HI>Palermitan,</HI> of the Knightly Family of <HI>Beccatelli</HI> of <HI>Bologna,</HI> an Orator &amp; a noble Poet, &amp; much ēdeared to all the Princes of his time.

<HEAD>A Description of the Island of <HI>MALTA</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEtween <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and the River of the one and t'other shore of <HI>Barbary,</HI> are fixed the two Islands <HI>Melita</HI> or <HI>Malta,</HI> and <HI>Gaulo</HI> or <HI>Gozo,</HI> the one distant from the other five miles, but eloigned from <HI>Pachino</HI> or <HI>Capo Passero</HI> a Promontory of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> (which they look to∣wards) one hundred miles, and from <HI>Africa</HI> one hundred and ninety miles. <HI>Malta</HI> is 60. miles in circumference, being all as it were a plain though somewhat Rocky, and exposed to the windes, it hath ma∣ny and secure Ports, but towards the North tis wholly deprived of fresh waters, but on the western parts are excellent Currance, and it produceth most fruitfull trees. Where tis broadest tis 12 miles over, and in the longest part 20 miles, and in all those seas is there not one Island so great distance from the firm Land as this is. In more then six places towards <HI>Sicilia,</HI> tis hollowed, and hath Ports as it were formed by the Sea of <HI>Sicilia</HI> for receipt of its Pyrates or Ro∣vers on the Sea, but towards <HI>Tripolis</HI> tis all full of Cliffes and Rocks af∣fording no mannor of Harbour. Tis called <HI>Melita</HI> in Latine from the Bees which in Greek are called <HI>Melitte</HI> for that the abundance and goodnesse of Flowers causeth in this Isle the production of the most excellent hony, but of late by corruption of the word we call it <HI>Malta.</HI> At its first habituation it yielded obedience to King <HI>Battus</HI> famous for his riches, and for the friendship and hospitality of <HI>Di∣do,</HI> whence afterwards it obeyed the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI> Whereof the many Collumnes placed up and down the Countrey, engraven with antient <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Characters (farr different from the <HI>Hebrean</HI>) give sufficient testimony. But at the same time when <HI>Sicilia</HI> was reduced to the <HI>Romans,</HI> it also rendered it self and was therefore governed by the same Laws, and the same Praetor as <HI>Sicilia</HI> was. Wherewith also

coming afterwards into the power of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> it finally with <HI>Gozo</HI> in the yeer 1090. was possessed by <HI>Ruggieri Normanno,</HI> Count of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> till at length it obeyed the Christian Princes. The Ayr over all the Island is most healthfull, but chiefly to them that inure them∣selves to it: It hath Fountains and Orchards copiously replenished with Date Trees, and its soyle every where produceth plentifully all sorts of Grain and Corn, Flax, Cotton, Wool, Cummin seeds, and abundance of Roses eminently sweet favoured: here▪ also they have a kind of little neat white Dogs, which from their long hair we call shocks, of much delight to the people. The Earth is sowed all the year with little husbandry, and they reap two harvests and the trees likewise bear fruit twice in the yeer. In the winter e∣very thing is green and flourisheth, and in the summer is burnt up with heat, howbeit a certain Dew falls which exceedingly nouri∣sheth the Corn. At the head of a long and strait point almost oppo∣site to the <HI>Capo Passero</HI> or <HI>Pachino</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> is erected the <HI>Fortezza</HI> of <HI>Sant Ermo,</HI> but on the right hand towards <HI>Sicilia</HI> are some other points, and between them and <HI>Sant Ermo</HI> is a Channel of water upon one of which points is the Castle <HI>Sant Angelo,</HI> and the other the <HI>For∣tezza</HI> of <HI>San Michael</HI> with their Bourges: between the one and the other of which lie the ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> &amp; Galleys in a Channel which is locked at the utmost points with a vast Iron Chain. Eight miles off which place up the Land stands the City called <HI>Malta</HI> famoused by the Reliques of very noble Edifices, and by the antient dignity of a Bishoprick. This Isle hath a Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>montory whereon was built a most antient and noble Temple dedicated to <HI>Juno,</HI> and held in great reverence, and another on the South to <HI>Hercules,</HI> whereof at this day huge ruines ap∣pear at the Port <HI>Euro.</HI> The men of this Island are brown complexi∣oned, and their genius more approaches that of the <HI>Sicilians</HI> then any other. The women are beautifull enough but fly company, goe obscured abroad, are kept close at home, yet following the same manner of life as the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> and speaking a language more like and near the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> then any other language. The people are generally religious and particularly pay a great devotion to Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> to whom this Island is dedicated, for that here he by chance fell into the Sea, and was here entertained with great humanity: and on that shore where he fell in, is built a venerable Chapel; for their respect to whom they believe no noysome nor venemous Crea∣ture can grow or live on this Island. And from the <HI>Grotto</HI> where that Saint stood are stones by many plucked away, and carryed through <HI>Italy,</HI> (called the <HI>Gratia</HI> of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI>) to healthe bitings of Scor∣pions and Serpents. In our Age this Island had and hath great splen∣dour for its Devotion, and the religious order of the Knights of <HI>Sant Giovanni</HI> or <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the which having lost <HI>Rhodes</HI> (ta∣ken from them in the yeer 1522. by <HI>Soliman</HI> the magnificent the great <HI>Tnrk</HI>) had this Island given them by <HI>Charles the</HI> 5th. Emperour, where they have built the aforenamed Castles and Forts, that they may there reside with perpetual security. In the yeer 1565. they valiantly defended the same against a most potent <HI>Armada,</HI> which the same <HI>So∣liman</HI> sent thither to conquer the Island and to drive out those Knights: which in time to come will not contribute lesse glory to <HI>Malta,</HI> then that which they reaped in times past from the general

Council which under Pope Innocent the first was there celebrated by 214. Bishops against <HI>Pelagius</HI> the <HI>Heretike;</HI> among others there met Saint <HI>Austine</HI> and <HI>Sylvano</HI> Bishop of <HI>Malta. Soliman</HI> sent to this Attempt an <HI>Armada,</HI> a Fleet of 200 sayls, under the command o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>Piali Bassa</HI> General of the Sea, a man both valiant and judicious, and of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> the <HI>Bassa</HI> General of the Land, a man very crafty, and much experienc't in warlike affairs: who having disembarked and landed their Army on the 18. of <HI>May,</HI> besieged and battered the Castle <HI>Sant Ermo,</HI> and after many contests and attempts, having beat down that wall flat to the Earth on the 23d. of <HI>June</HI> became Masters of the Fort, and put all the defendors to the Sword and cut them to pieces. There dyed then on the Turks part <HI>Dragut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ais</HI> the famous Pyrat, being wounded under the ear by the blow of a stone. Then they turned their force upon the two other <HI>Fortezza's</HI> of <HI>Sant Mi∣chael,</HI> and <HI>Saint Angelo.</HI> They planted a fierce battery against <HI>San Mi∣chael,</HI> which levelled the walls with the bank of the Fosse or Ditch by their falling therein, but in many and many assaults which they gave to the Castle, they were alwaies valiantly repelled by the Horse. <HI>Giovanni Valetta</HI> a French man the then great Master, a man of singular valour and prudence, not failing in any thing of conduct or necessa∣ry provision, that might merit the esteem of an excellent Comman∣der. At last <HI>Don Garcia de Toledo,</HI> having selected sixty of the most nimble and polite galleys out of those of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and fur∣nished them with nine thousand six hundred Souldiers between <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> advanced to land them securely on the Island. Which the <HI>Turks</HI> understanding forthwith imbarqued their Artille∣ry, and advanced with 8000 Souldiers to view the Christian Army, who fell upon them with such ardour and fury, that they immedi∣ately most basely run away, and got into their Galleys, leaving 1800 dead, having killed but only four on the Christians side: And in this manner were the <HI>Turks constrained</HI> to abandon the Island to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>oul shame and confusion, and the great honour of Almighty God, whose hand strengthning this small number, clearly demonstrated, that by his favour, the valour of a few can oppose the violence of many.</P>
