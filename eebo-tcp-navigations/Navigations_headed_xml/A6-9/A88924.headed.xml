<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are Welcome unto the <HI>History</HI> of a Tedious <HI>War,</HI> and unto a <HI>Period</HI> of that <HI>War</HI> so far in prospect, as to ren∣der its <HI>History</HI> Seasonable.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Reasonable</HI> man will readily allow, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is a <HI>Duty</HI> to God, and a <HI>Service</HI> to the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or to preserve, the <HI>Memory</HI> of such matters, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been the more <HI>Memorable Occurrences</HI> in the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> <HI>War,</HI> that ha's for <HI>Ten Years</HI> together, been mul∣tiplying <HI>Changes</HI> and <HI>Sorrows</HI> upon us. And the <HI>Author,</HI> in whose Historical Writings, the most <HI>Inquisitive Envy,</HI> ha's never to this Hour detected, so much as one Voluntary and Material Mistake, or one farthing paid unto the Readers in the Coin of <HI>Candia,</HI> ha's now chosen to preserve the <HI>Memory</HI> of these matters, while they are <HI>Fresh</HI> &amp; <HI>New,</HI> and one hath not <HI>Fifty years,</HI> which is the Channel of the <HI>River of Oblivion,</HI> to pass over un∣to them. This <HI>Expedition</HI> is used in the publica∣tion of our <HI>Decennium Luctuosum,</HI> in hope that if any mistake, worth Noting, do appear in <HI>these</HI> Writing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it may, <HI>Like</HI> and perhaps <HI>With,</HI> a <HI>Second Edition,</HI> be <HI>Corrected and Amended.</HI></P>
<P>He Expects no <HI>Thanks</HI> for his Essayes to <HI>Do Good,</HI> in this way, or any other, unto any part of his Country, to whom he would gladly devote all his <HI>Talents,</HI> if he were a Thousand Times bet∣ter <HI>Talented</HI> than he is; and though the most Ungrateful Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Imaginable (which are too well known by the Name of <HI>Country-pay</HI>) should be given him, he would still be of that Opinion, <HI>Recte fecisse Merces est,</HI> If a man may <HI>Do Good,</HI> it is enough.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Favour</HI> he desires of you, is, That you would <HI>not Enquire after him;</HI> or ask, <HI>who he is?</HI> but that, as he is at best, but an <HI>Obscure</HI> Person, he may continue in yet more <HI>Obscurity:</HI> which will be a greater pleasure to him than to be
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> placed among <HI>the Great men of Achaia.</HI></P>
<P>For indeed, He hath often thought on a pas∣sage written by Holy Mr. <HI>Row,</HI> to his Excellent Son, <HI>I pray, That God would make use of my self and you, in such a way, as that God only may be seen, and we not be taken notice of at all; that He may have the Glory, and we may not be seen.</HI></P>
<P>Could he have invited His EXCELLENCY unto such a glorious Table, as that in a certain Cabinet at <HI>Florence,</HI> which is furnished with Birds and Flow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, all consisting of Nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly polished <HI>Jewels</HI> it laid into it; a Work Fifteen years in making, and worth an Hundred Thousand Crowns: or could he have written a Book, wor∣thy to be laid up in the <HI>Cabinet</HI> of <HI>Darius:</HI> the Author might have been under a Temptation to have had his <HI>Name</HI> Engraved upon his <HI>Work.</HI> But a little Boild <HI>Indian Corn</HI> in a <HI>Tray,</HI> is as much as our Best History of an <HI>Indian War,</HI> compos'd perhaps in fewer <HI>Dayes,</HI> than there were <HI>Years</HI> in the <HI>War,</HI> may presume to be compar'd unto And since our History will not afford such a Di¦version unto <HI>His Excellency,</HI> under the Indispositi∣ons of His <HI>Health,</HI> as those of <HI>Livy</HI> &amp; <HI>Curtius</HI> did unto the Princes that Recovered their lost <HI>Health</HI> by Reading them; nor can any any passage here be so happy, as <HI>That</HI> which cured <HI>Laurentius Me∣dices</HI> of a Malady, by having it Read unto him it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l require no more than a <HI>Nameless Writer,</HI> to Assure that Great Person on this Occasion,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> That all the Good People of <HI>New-England,</HI> make their Fervent Vows unto the Almighty, <HI>For His Excellencies Prosperity, and the Welfare of His Excel∣lent Lady, and of His Noble and Hopeful Offspring.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Naming</HI> of the Author, is as little Ne∣cessary to Qualify him, that he may pay publick Acknowledgments unto the Honorable, the <HI>Lieu∣tenant Governour;</HI> not only for his Cares about the Publick, while it was <HI>Tempestuated,</HI> with the <HI>Indian War,</HI> which now makes an <HI>History;</HI> but chiefly for his more than ordinary Tenderness of that Society, which ha's been the very, <HI>Decus ac Tutamen,</HI> of <HI>New England.</HI> The <HI>Nameless Writer</HI> of this History, may Report, that with a Greater Expence, than that of the <HI>First-Founder,</HI> this Ho∣norable Person proves, that he <HI>Loves our Nation,</HI> by <HI>Building</HI> us another <HI>Edifice,</HI> for the Supply of all our <HI>Synagogues,</HI> and STOUGHTON-HALL, out shines HARVARD-COLLEDGE: and he speaks <HI>Kinder Language,</HI> as well as <HI>Better Latin,</HI> than that Eminent States-man in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whose Answer to a Petition for the priviledges of an University there to be restored, was, <HI>Non cura∣mus vostros privilegios.</HI> This Report may he give, without being obliged for to Confess any other <HI>Name</HI> than this, which he Readily Confesses; <HI>One that was once a Member of</HI> Harvard-Colledge.</P>
<P>I pray, Sirs, Ask no further; Let this Writing be, like that on the Wall to <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> where the
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> Hand only was to be seen, and not who's it was. The <HI>History</HI> is compiled with <HI>Incontestable Vera∣city;</HI> and since there is no <HI>Ingenuity</HI> in it, but less than what many Pens in the Land might Com∣mand, he knows not why his Writing <HI>Anonymously</HI> may not Shelter him, from the Inconveniencies of having any Notice, one way or other, taken of him. Though among his other small Furni∣ture, he hath not left himself unfurnished with skill in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Language, yet he never could bring himself to the Belief of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Proverb, <HI>Quien no parece, perece; i. e.</HI> He that appears not, perishes; He that Shows not himself to the world, is undone. At <HI>Milain,</HI> there is an <HI>Aca∣demy</HI> of Sensible Persons, called The <HI>Nascosti,</HI> or, <HI>Hidden men;</HI> At <HI>Venice,</HI> there is one of such persons, called, The <HI>Incogniti;</HI> and at <HI>Parma,</HI> there is one of them, called, The <HI>Innominati.</HI> If there were nothing else Disagreeable in them, the Author of this <HI>History,</HI> would be glad of an Admission into such an <HI>Academy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>History</HI> is indeed of no very <HI>Fine Thred;</HI> and the Readers, who every where <HI>Fish for no∣thing but Carps,</HI> and who Love, like <HI>Augustus</HI> to <HI>Tax all the World,</HI> may find Fault enough with it. Nevertheless, while the <HI>Fault</HI> of an <HI>Untruth</HI> can't be found in it, the Author pretends, that the famous History of the <HI>Trojan War</HI> it self, comes behind our little History of the <HI>Indian War;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> For the best An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iquaries, have now confuted <HI>Homer;</HI> the Walls of <HI>Troy</HI> were it seems, all made of <HI>Poets Paper;</HI> and the Siege of the Town with the Tragedies of the Wooden Horse, were all but a piece of <HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>And if a <HI>War</HI> between <HI>Us,</HI> and an Handful of <HI>Indians,</HI> do appear no more than a <HI>Batracho∣myomachie,</HI> to the World <HI>abroad</HI> yet unto us <HI>at home,</HI> it hath been considerable-enough, to make an <HI>History.</HI> Nor is the Author afraid of promi∣sing, that of all the <HI>Thirty Articles</HI> which make up this <HI>History,</HI> there shall not be <HI>One,</HI> without <HI>something</HI> in it, that may by our selves be justly thought <HI>Considerable.</HI></P>
<P>Should any <HI>Petit Monsieur</HI> complain (as the Captain, that found not himself in the <HI>Tapestry Hangings,</HI> which Exhibited the Story of the Spanish Invasion in 1588.) that he don't find himself mentioned in this <HI>History,</HI> the Author has his Apology. He has done as <HI>well</HI> and as <HI>much</HI> as he could, that whatever was worthy of a mention, might have it; and if this Collecti∣on of Matters be not compleat, yet he supposes it may be more compleat, than any one else hath made; and now he hath done, he hath not pull'd up the <HI>Ladder</HI> after him; <HI>others</HI> may go on, as they please, with a compleater Com∣posure.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<P>If the Author hath taken Delight, in this <HI>Hi∣story,</HI> and at all Times, to Celebrate the <HI>Merits,</HI> of such as have Deserved well of his Country, [which he has here done it may be, for some that never could afford <HI>him</HI> a good word!] Especially, if he do Erect <HI>Statues</HI> for <HI>Dead Wor∣thies,</HI> when there is no Room Left for Flatte∣ry, [for who will bestow <HI>paint</HI> upon a <HI>Dead Face!</HI>] And if he do all this, with all possible concern, to avoid casting <HI>Aspersions</HI> upon <HI>others:</HI> Why should any betray such <HI>Ili Nature,</HI> as to be angry at it? <HI>My Good Country, forgive him this Injury!</HI></P>
<Q>Huic Uni forsan poteram Succumbere culpae.</Q>
<P>But, whatever this <HI>History</HI> be, it aims at the <HI>Doing</HI> of <HI>Good,</HI> as well as the <HI>Telling</HI> of <HI>Truth;</HI> and if its Aim shall be attained, <HI>That</HI> will be a sufficient <HI>Reward</HI> for all the Trouble of Writing it. When he Desires any more, he'l give you his <HI>Name;</HI> In the mean Time, as a far greater man once was called, <HI>Ludovicus Nihili,</HI> which you may make, <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Nothingham;</HI> so the Au∣thor will count himself not a little favoured, if he may pass for one of no more Account, than a, <HI>No body;</HI> which would certainly make a very <HI>Blameless</HI> person of him.</P>
<P>However, that the <HI>History</HI> may not altogether want a <HI>Subscription;</HI> the Author, finding it a Custome among the Christian Writers of the <HI>Orient,</HI> when they have written a Treatise, to
<PB N="10" REF="6"/> Subscribe it after this manner; <HI>Scriptum per Ser∣vum vilem pauperem, omnibus Justitiis privatum, peccatorem magis quam omnis Caro;</HI> Or, <HI>Scripsit hoc pauper</HI> N. N. Or, <HI>Est Scriptura servi pauperis, et qui Benevolentia Dei indiget, et miserationibus;</HI> he will accordingly Subscribe himself, <HI>The Chief of Sinners.</HI> Nevertheless, he will humbly Lay claim to the Words, used by the <HI>Nameless Au∣thor</HI> of a Treatise, Entituled, <HI>The Faithful Stew∣ard:</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">Tho' I am worse then they speak of me, who cast Disgrace upon me, and I can Espy <HI>Ten</HI> Faults in my self, where they can discern <HI>One,</HI> yet I can, thro' Grace, Appeal to Thee, O Lord, with some Comfort, that I am <HI>Dis∣pleased</HI> with <HI>my self</HI> for my Sins, and would fain <HI>please Thee,</HI> in all Things, at all Times, in all places, and in every Condition.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>Decennium Luctuosum.</HI> OR, The Remarkables of a long WAR WITH <HI>Indian</HI>-Salvages.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>INTRODUCTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TWenty Three Years have Rolled a∣way since the Nations of Indians within the Confines of <HI>New England,</HI> generally began a Fierce <HI>War,</HI> upon the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants of that Country. The Flame of <HI>War</HI> then Raged thro' a great part of
<PB N="12" REF="7"/> the Country, whereby many whole <HI>Towns</HI> were L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id in Ashes, and many <HI>Lives</HI> were Sacrificed. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle more than one years Time, the <HI>U∣nited-Colonies</HI> of <HI>Plymouth, Massachuset,</HI> and <HI>Con∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticut,</HI> with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r United Endeavours, bravely C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quered the <HI>Salvages.</HI> The Evident Hand of Heaven appearing on the Side of a people whose <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> was alone in the Almigh∣ty <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> Extinguished whole <HI>Nations</HI> of the <HI>Salvages</HI> at such a rate, that there can hard∣ly any of them, now be found under any Di∣stinction upon the face of the Earth. Onely, the Eare of our Northern and Eastern Regions in that <HI>War,</HI> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om that of the rest. The Desol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions of the <HI>War</HI> had over∣whelm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d all the Settlements to the North-East of <HI>Wests.</HI> And when the Time arrived, that all hands were weary of the <HI>War,</HI> a sort of a <HI>Peace</HI> was patched up, which Left a Body of <HI>Indians,</HI> not only with Horrible Murders Unrevenged, but also, in the possession of no little part of the Countrey, with circumstances which the <HI>English</HI> might think, not very Honourable. Up∣on this <HI>Peace,</HI> the English returned unto their <HI>Plantations;</HI> their Number increased; they Stock'd their <HI>Farms,</HI> and Sow'd their <HI>Fields;</HI> they found the <HI>Air</HI> as <HI>Healthful;</HI> as the <HI>Earth</HI> was <HI>Fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tful;</HI> their <HI>Lumber</HI> and their <HI>Fishery</HI> be∣came a considerable Merchandize; continual Accessions were made unto them, until Ten or
<PB N="13" REF="7"/> a Dozen <HI>Towns,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> and the County of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> were suddenly Started up into something of Observation.</P>
<P>But in the Year, 1688. the <HI>Indians</HI> which dwelt after the <HI>Indian</HI> manner among them, Commenced another <HI>War</HI> upon these <HI>Plantati∣ons,</HI> which hath broke <HI>them</HI> up, and strangely held <HI>us</HI> in play for <HI>Ten Years</HI> together. In these <HI>Ten Years,</HI> there hath been a variety of <HI>Remarka∣ble Occurrences;</HI> and because I have supposed that a <HI>Relation</HI> of those <HI>Occurrences</HI> may be Ac∣ceptable and Profitable to some of my Coun∣try men, I shall now <HI>with all Faithfulness</HI> Endea∣vour it. <HI>With all Faithfulness,</HI> I say; because tho' there should happen any <HI>Circumstantial Mi∣stake</HI> in our Story, (for 'tis a rare thing for any Two men, concern'd in the same Action, to give the Story of it, without some <HI>Circumstantial Difference,</HI>) yet even thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also, I shall be willing to <HI>Retract</HI> and <HI>Correct,</HI> if there be found any just occasion: But for any one <HI>Material Error,</HI> in the whole Composure, I challenge the most <HI>Sagacious Malica,</HI> upon Earth to detect it, while matters are y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> so fresh, as to allow the Detecti∣on of it. I disdain to make the Apology, once made by the Roman Historian; <HI>Nemo Historicus non aliquid mentitus, et habiturus sum mendaciorum Comites, quos Historiae et eloquentiae miramur Au∣thores.</HI> No, I will write with an Irreproachable and Incontestable <HI>Veracity;</HI> and I will write not
<PB N="14" REF="8"/> one Thihg, but what I am furnished with so good Authority for, that any Reasonable man, who will please to Examine it, shall say, <HI>I do well to insert it as I do:</HI> And I will hope, that my Reader hath not been Studying of <HI>Godefridus de Valle's</HI> Book, <HI>De Arte nihil Credendi;</HI> About, <HI>The Art of Believing nothing.</HI> Wherefore, ha∣ving at the very Beginning thus given such a Knock upon thy <HI>Head, O malice;</HI> that thou canst never with Reason <HI>Hiss</HI> at our <HI>History,</HI> we will proceed unto the several Articles of it.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE. I.</HI> The Occasion and Beginning of the WAR.</HEAD>
<P>IF <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> had never given it as a great Rule of <HI>History, Historiae primum Studium, pri∣maria{que} consideratio esse videtur, insoliti gravis{que} Casus principio causas investigare,</HI> Yet my Reader would have expected, that I should <HI>Begin</HI> the History of our <HI>War,</HI> with an History of the Oc∣currences and Occasions which did <HI>Begin</HI> the <HI>War.</HI> Now, Reader, I am at the very first fal∣len upon a <HI>Difficult Point;</HI> and I am in danger of pulling a <HI>War</HI> upon my self, by Endeavour∣ing of thy Satisfaction. In Truth, I had rather be called a <HI>Coward,</HI> than undertake my self to Determine the <HI>Truth</HI> in this matter: but having <HI>Armed</HI> my self with some good Authority, for
<PB N="15" REF="8"/> it, I will Transcribe Two or Three Reports of the matter, now in my Hands, and Leave it unto thy own Determination.</P>
<P>One Account, I have now lying by me, Written by a Gentleman of <HI>Dover;</HI> in these Terms.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>The Eastern <HI>Indians,</HI> and especially those of <HI>Saco,</HI> and <HI>Ammonoscoggin,</HI> pretend many Reasons, for the late Quarrel against the <HI>English,</HI> which began this long and bloody <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Because the <HI>English</HI> refused to pay that yearly Tribute of <HI>Corn,</HI> agreed upon, in the <HI>Ar∣ticles of Peace,</HI> formerly concluded with them, by the English Commissioners</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because they were Invaded in their</HI> Fishery, <HI>at</HI> Saco <HI>River, by certain Gentlemen, who stop'd the</HI> Fish, <HI>from coming up the River, with their</HI> Nets, <HI>and</HI> Sains. <HI>This they were greatly Affronted at; saying,</HI> They thought (though the English had got away their Lands as they had, yet) the Fishery of the Rivers had been a priviledge Reserved Entire unto themselves.</P>
<P N="3">3.Because they were Abused by the <HI>English,</HI> in Suffering, if not Turning, their Cattel over to a certain Island to destroy their Corn.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the <HI>Fourth,</HI> and <HI>Main,</HI> provocation was, The Granting, or <HI>Pattenting</HI> of their Lands, to some English; at which they were greatly Enraged; threatning the Surveyor, to knock him on the Head, if he came to lay out any Lands there.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="16" REF="9"/>5. To these may be added, the Common Abuses, in <HI>Trading; viz.</HI> Drunkenness, Cheat∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which such as Trade much with them, are seldom Innocent of.</P></Q>
<P>Doubtless, these <HI>Indian</HI> Allegations may be an∣swered with many <HI>English</HI> Vindications. But I shall at present Intermeddle no further, than to offer another Account, which also I have in my Hands, written by a Gentleman of <HI>Casco.</HI></P>
<P>It runs in such Terms as these.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Many were the Outrages and Insultings of the <HI>Indians</HI> upon the <HI>English,</HI> while Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> was Governour. At <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> and other places at the Eastward, the Indians killed sundry Cattel, came into Houses, and threatned to knock the people on the Head; and at several Times gave out Reports, that they would make a <HI>War</HI> upon the <HI>English,</HI> and that they were ani∣mated to do so, by the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> behaving themselves so insultingly, gave just occasion of great suspicion. In order for the finding out the <HI>Truth,</HI> and to Endeavour the preventing of a <HI>War,</HI> Capt. <HI>Blackman,</HI> a Justice of Peace, with some of the Neighbourhood, of <HI>Saco</HI> River, Seized several <HI>Indians</HI> that had been bloody murderous <HI>Rogues,</HI> in the first <HI>In∣dian War;</HI> being the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ring Leaders, and most capable to do mischief. The said Capt. <HI>Blackman</HI> Seized to the Number of between Sixteen and Twenty, in order for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Ex∣amination,
<PB N="17" REF="9"/> and to bring in the rest to a Treaty. The said <HI>Blackman</HI> soon sent the said <HI>Indians,</HI> with a Good Guard, to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> in <HI>Casco-bay,</HI> there to be Secured, until orders could come from <HI>Boston,</HI> concerning them. And in the mean Time, the said <HI>Indians,</HI> were well provided with Provisions, and Suitable Necessaries. The rest of the Indians Robb'd the English, and took some English Prisoners: Whereupon Post was sent to <HI>Boston.</HI> Sir <HI>Edmond Andross</HI> being at <HI>New-York,</HI> the Gentlemen of <HI>Boston</HI> sent to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> some Souldiers for the Defence of the Country, and also the Worshipful Mr. <HI>Stoughton,</HI> with others, to Treat with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in order for the Settling of a <HI>Peace,</HI> and getting in of our English Captives. As soon as the said Gentle∣men arrived at the East-ward, they sent away one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners, to the rest of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to Summon them, to bring in the Eng∣lish they had taken; Also, that their <HI>Sachims</HI> should come in, to treat with the English, in order that a Just Satisfaction should be made on both sides. The Gentlemen waited the Return of the <HI>Indian</HI> Messenger; and when he Return∣ed, he brought Answer, That they would meet our English at a place, called, <HI>Macquoit,</HI> and there they would bring in the English Captives, and Treat with the English. And although the place appointed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> for the Meeting, was some Leagues distant from <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="10"/> yet our English Gentlemen did conde∣scend to it, in hope of getting in our Captives, &amp; putting a stop to further Trouble. They Dis∣pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch'd away to the place, and carried the <HI>In∣dian</HI> Prisoners with them, and staid at the place appointed, expecting the coming of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> that had promised a Meeting. But they like false perfidious Rogues, did not appear. Without doubt they had been counselled what to do, by the <HI>French,</HI> and their Abettors; as the <HI>Indians</HI> did declare afterwards; and that they were near the place, and saw our <HI>English,</HI> that were to Treat with them, but would not shew themselves, but did Endeavour to take an Opportunity to Destroy our English, that were to Treat them. Such was their Treachery! Our Gentlemen staid days to wait their co∣ming; but seeing they did not appear at the place appointed, they Returned to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and brought the Indian Prisoners; expecting that the other <HI>Indians</HI> would have sent down some Reason, why they did not appear at the place appointed, and to make some excuse for themselves. But instead of any compliance; they fell upon <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> and there kill'd several of our English. Whereupon the East∣ern parts were ordered to get into Garrisons, and to be upon their Guard, until further Or∣ders from Sir <HI>Edmond Andros;</HI> and that the In∣dian Prisoners should be sent to <HI>Boston;</HI> which
<PB N="19" REF="10"/> was done with great care, and not one of them hurt; and care taken daily for provision. But Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> Returning from <HI>New York,</HI> set them all at Liberty; not so much as taking care to Redeem those of our <HI>English</HI> for them, that were in their hands. I had kept one at <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI> a Prisoner to be a Guide into the Woods, for our English, to find out the Haunts of our Heathen Enemies. But Sir <HI>E. A</HI> sent an Ex∣press to me, that upon my utmost peril I should set the said Indian at Liberty, and take care that all the Arms, that were taken from him, and all the rest of those Capt. <HI>Blackman</HI> had Seized, should be delivered up to them, without any Orders to Receive the like of ours from them.</Q></P>
<P>It will be readily Acknowledged, that here was enough done, to render the <HI>Indians</HI> Inexcu∣sable, for not coming in, upon the <HI>Proclamation,</HI> which Sir <HI>Edmond Andros,</HI> then Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> immediately Emitted thereupon, requiring them, to Surrender the <HI>Murderers,</HI> now among them. A Spaniard, that was a Souldier, would say, <HI>That if we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Good Cause, the smell of Gunpowder in the Field is as sweet as the Incense at the Altar.</HI> Let the Reader judge after these things, what scent there was in the <HI>Gun∣powder</HI> spent for Nine or Ten years together in our <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>Indian Salvages.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that while we are upon this Head, we
<PB N="20" REF="11"/> may at once dispatch it, I will unto these Two Accounts, add certain passages of one more; which was published in <HI>September.</HI> 1689.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Such were the <HI>Obscure Measures</HI> taken at that Time of Day, that the <HI>Rise</HI> of this <HI>War,</HI> hath been as dark as that of the River <HI>Nilus;</HI> only the Generality of <HI>Thinking People</HI> through the Country, can Remember <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>Why,</HI> every one did foretel, <HI>A War.</HI> If any <HI>Wild English</HI> (for there are such as well as of another Na∣tion,) did then, <HI>Begin</HI> to Provoke and Affront the <HI>Indians,</HI> yet those <HI>Indians</HI> had a fairer way to come by Right, than that of <HI>Blood shed;</HI> no∣thing worthy of, or calling for, any <HI>Such</HI> Re∣venge was done unto them.

<PB N="21" REF="11"/> the <HI>Only</HI> way, of coming at those Wandring Salvages: But That very <HI>Sachim</HI> now treache∣rously, of an <HI>Embassador</HI> became a <HI>Traitor,</HI> and annexed himself, with his People, to the <HI>Heard</HI> of our Enemies, which have since been Ravag∣ing, Pillaging, and Murdering at a rate, which we ought to count, <HI>Intolerable.</HI> The <HI>Penacook</HI> Indians, of whom we were Jealous, we likewise Treated with; and while we were, by our <HI>Kindnesses</HI> and <HI>Courtesies</HI> Endeavouring to render them utterly Inexcusable, if ever they sought our Harm: Even <HI>Then</HI> did <HI>These</HI> also, by some <HI>Evil Instigation (the Devils,</HI> no doubt!) quickly Surprize a Plantation, where they had been Civilly treated a Day or Two before, &amp; Commit at once, more <HI>Plunder</HI> and <HI>Murder,</HI> than can be heard with any patience.</Q></P>
<P>Reader, Having so placed these Three Ac∣counts as to defend my <HI>Teeth,</HI> I think, I may safely proceed with our Story.

Whether an Order were not obtained from the King of <HI>England,</HI> at the Instance of the French Embassa∣dor, to Restore these <HI>Wines?</HI> Whether upon the Vexation of this <HI>Order,</HI> we none of us ran a <HI>New

And whether, the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were Extremely under the Influence of St. <HI>Casteen,</HI> that had Mar∣ried a Sagamores Daughter among them, did not from this very Moment begin to be obstre∣perous? And, whether all the Sober English in the Country, did not from this very Moment, foretel a <HI>War?</HI> But for any Answer to all these Enquiries, I will be my self a <HI>Tacitus.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE. II.</HI> The first Acts of Hostility, between the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the <HI>English.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen one Capt. <HI>Sargeant</HI> had Seized some of the principal <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Saco,</HI> by order of Justice <HI>Blackman,</HI> presently the <HI>Indians</HI> fell to Seizing as many of the <HI>English,</HI> as they could catch. Capt. <HI>Rowden,</HI> with many more, in one place, and Capt. <HI>Gendal,</HI> with sundry more, in another place, particularly fell into the Hands of these desperate <HI>Man catchers. Rowden,</HI> with many of his Folks, never got out of their
<PB N="23" REF="12"/> Cruel Hands: but <HI>Gendal</HI> with his, got a Re∣lease, one can scarce tell, <HI>How,</HI> upon the Re∣turn of those which had been detain'd in <HI>Boston.</HI> Hitherto there was no Spilling of <HI>Blood!</HI> But some Time in <HI>September</HI> following, this Capt. <HI>Gen∣dal,</HI> went up, with Souldiers and others, to a place above <HI>Casco,</HI> called, <HI>North Yarmouth;</HI> having Orders to build <HI>Stockado's,</HI> on both sides the Ri∣ver, for Defence of the place, in case of any Sud∣den Invasion. While they were at work, an <HI>English Captive</HI> came to 'em, with Information, that Seventy or Eighty of the Enemy were just coming upon 'em: and he advised 'em, <HI>To yeeld quietly, that they might Save their Lives.</HI> The Souldiers that went thither from the Southward, being terrifyed at this Report, Ran with an Hasty Terror to get over the River; but with more <HI>Hast,</HI> than <HI>Good Speed;</HI> for they ran directly into the Hands of the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> dragging along these their Prisoners with 'em, came up to∣wards the <HI>Casconians;</HI> who, having but a very Little Time to Consult, yet in this Time Resolved; First, <HI>That they would not be Seized by the Salvages;</HI> Next, <HI>That they would free their Friends out of the Hands of the Salvages, if it were possible;</HI> Thirdly, <HI>That if it were possible, they would use all other Force upon the Salvages, without coming to down right Fight.</HI> Accordingly, They laid hold on their Neighbours, whom the <HI>Salvages</HI> had Seized, and this with so much Dexterity, that
<PB N="24" REF="13"/> they cleared them all, Except one or Two; whereof the whole Number was about a <HI>Dozen.</HI> But in the <HI>Scuffle,</HI> one Sturdy and Surly <HI>Indian,</HI> held his prey so fast, that one <HI>Benedict Pulcifer,</HI> gave the <HI>Mastiff</HI> a Blow, with the Edge of his <HI>Broad Ax</HI> upon the Shoulder, upon which they fell to't with a Vengeance, and Fired their <HI>Guns,</HI> on both sides, till some on both sides were Slain. These were, as one may call them, <HI>The Scower-pit,</HI> of a long <HI>War</HI> to follow. At last, the <HI>English,</HI> Victoriously chased away the Salvage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Re∣turned safely unto the other side of the River. And Thus was the <HI>Vein</HI> of <HI>New England</HI> first o∣pened, that afterwards <HI>Bled</HI> for Ten years toge∣ther! The Skirmish being over, Capt. <HI>Gendal,</HI> in the Evening, passed over the River, in a Ca∣noo, with none but a Servant; but Landing where the Enemy lay hid in the Bushes, they were both Slain immediately. And the same Evening, one <HI>Ryal,</HI> with another man, fell un∣awares into the Hands of the Enemy; <HI>Ryal</HI> was afterwards Ransomed, by Monsieur St. <HI>Casteen,</HI> but the other man, was barbarously Butchered. Soon after this, the Enemy went Eastward, unto a place call'd, <HI>Merry-Meeting,</HI> (from the Con∣course of diverse Rivers there,) where several English had a <HI>Sad Meeting</HI> with them; for they were killed, several of them even in Cold Blood, after the <HI>Indians</HI> had Seized upon their Houses &amp; their Persons. And about this Time, the Town
<PB N="25" REF="13"/> call'd <HI>Sheepscote,</HI> was entred by these Rapacious <HI>Wolves;</HI> who burnt all the Houses of the Town, save Two or Three. The People saved them∣selves by getting into the Fort, all but one Man, who going out of the Fort, for to Treat with 'em, was Treacherously Assassinated. Thus the place, which was counted, <HI>The Garden of the East,</HI> was infested by <HI>Serpents;</HI> and a <HI>Sword</HI> Expell'd the poor Inhabitants. Little more Spoil was done by the <HI>Salvages</HI> before <HI>Winter,</HI> Except only, that at a place called <HI>Kennebunk,</HI> near <HI>Winter harbour,</HI> they cut off Two Families, to wit, <HI>Barrows,</HI> and <HI>Bussies;</HI> but <HI>Winter</HI> coming on, the <HI>Serpents</HI> retired into their Holes.

<P>WHen the Keeper of the Wild Beasts, at <HI>Florence,</HI> ha's entertain'd the Spectators, with their Encounters on the Stage, he ha's this Device to make 'em Retire into the several <HI>Dens</HI> of their <HI>Seraglio.</HI> He ha's a fearful <HI>Machin</HI> of Wood, made like a Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Green Dragon,</HI> which a man within it roules upon Wheels, and holding out a Couple of Lighted Torches at the Eyes of
<PB N="26" REF="14"/> it, frights the fiercest Beast of them all, into the Cell that belongs unto him. Sir <HI>Edmond Andros,</HI> the Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> that he might Express his Resolutions, to force the Wild Beasts of the East into order, in the <HI>Winter</HI> now come∣ing on, turned upon them as Effectual a <HI>Machin,</HI> as the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> of <HI>Florence;</HI> that is to say, An Army of near a Thousand men. With this Army, he marched himself in Person, into the <HI>Caucasaean</HI> Regions, where he built a Fort at <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> and another Fort at <HI>Pechypscot</HI> Falls, besides the Fort at <HI>Sheepscote.</HI> He, and his <HI>Army,</HI> underwent no little Hard ship, thus in the Depth of <HI>Winter</HI> to Expose themselves unto the Cir∣cumstances of a <HI>Campaign,</HI> in all the Bleak <HI>Winds</HI> and Thick <HI>Snows</HI> of that Northern Country. But it was Hop'd, That Good <HI>Forts,</HI> being thus Garrison'd with Stout <HI>Hearts,</HI> in several Conve∣nient places, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Indians might be kept from their usual Retreats, both for <HI>Planting,</HI> and for <HI>Fishing,</HI> and lye open also to perpetual Incursions from the English, in the fittest seasons thereof: And it was Thought by the most sensible, this method would in a little while compel the Enemy to Submit unto any Terms: albeit others conside∣ring the Vast Woods of the Wilderness, and the French on the back of these Woods, fancied, that this was but a project to <HI>Hedge in the Cuckow.</HI> However, partly the <HI>Army,</HI> and partly the <HI>Win∣ter,</HI> frighted the <HI>Salvages,</HI> into their Inaccessible
<PB N="27" REF="14"/> <HI>Dens:</HI> &amp; yet not one of the <HI>Indians</HI> was killed; but Sickness, &amp; Service, kill'd it may be more of our <HI>English,</HI> than there were <HI>Indians</HI> then in Ho∣stility against them. The News of matters ap∣proaching towards a REVOLUTION in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> caused the Governour to Return unto <HI>Boston</HI> in the Spring; &amp; upon his Return, there fell out several odd Events, with <HI>Rumours,</HI> where∣of I have now nothing to say, but, That <HI>I love my Eyes too well,</HI> to mention them. Some of the <HI>Souldiers,</HI> took Advantage, from the Absence of the Governour, to desert their <HI>Stations</HI> in the Army; and tho' this Action, was by <HI>Good men</HI> generally condemned, as an <HI>Evil Action,</HI> yet their Friends began to gather together here and there in Little Bodies, to protect them from the Gover∣nour, concerning whom, abundance of odd Sto∣ries then buzz'd about the Country made 'em to imagine, that he had carried 'em out, only to Sacrifice 'em. Some of the principal Gen∣tlemen in <HI>Boston,</HI> consulting what was to be done, in this Extraordinary Juncture, They A∣greed, that altho' <HI>New-England</HI> had as much to Justify a <HI>Revolution</HI> as <HI>old,</HI> yet they would, if it were possible, extinguish all Essayes in the people, towards an <HI>Insurrection;</HI> in daily hopes of Orders from <HI>England</HI> for our Safety: but that if the Country people, by any unrestrainable Violen∣ces pushed the business on so far, as to make a <HI>Revolution</HI> unavoidable, Then, to prevent the
<PB N="28" REF="15"/> Shedding of <HI>Blood</HI> by an ungoverned <HI>Mobile,</HI> some of the Gentlemen present, should appear at the Head of it, with a <HI>Declaration</HI> accordingly prepared.

Written and Signed by the Chief Gentlemen of the <HI>Gover∣nours Council,</HI> will not wonder at it, that a <HI>Revo∣lution</HI> was now rendred indeed unavoidable. It was a Government whereof <HI>Ned Randolph,</HI> a Bird of their own Feather, confess'd, as we find in one of his published Letters, <HI>That they were as Arbitrary as the Great Turk.</HI> And for such a Go∣vernment, a better Similitude cannot perhaps be thought on, than that of Monsr <HI>Souligne; 'Tis like the Condition of persons possessed with Evil Spirits, which will go an Hundred Leagues in less time than others can Ten; but at the Journies End find them∣selves to be so Bruised that they never can Recover it.</HI> The <HI>Revolution,</HI> (and, ye <HI>Tories,</HI> a <HI>Just</HI> one) was accordingly <HI>Made,</HI> on the Eighteenth of <HI>April;</HI> which Their Majesties, then happily Seated on the British Throne, kindly Accepted and Approved.

<PB N="29" REF="15"/> to <HI>Authorize and Empower them in their Admini∣strations.</HI> Thus they waited for further Di∣rections from the Authority of <HI>England,</HI> and such a <HI>Settlement,</HI> as would <HI>most Conduce</HI> (which were the words of the Kings Letter, bearing Date, <HI>Aug.</HI> 12 1689.) <HI>to the Security and Satisfaction of the Subjects in that Colony.</HI></P>

Above an Hundred, some say Five Hundred of the <HI>Indians,</HI> about break of Day, having Surprized the Secure and Silent <HI>English,</HI> they particularly rushed into the Garrison of the Generous Major, which was by <HI>Sinon Mesandowit</HI> (for, bestowing a <HI>Heathen Name</HI> upon him, we'l now call him <HI>so,</HI>) opened for them, and having first barbarously Murdered the Old Gentleman, who was Aequivalent unto <HI>Two and Twenty,</HI> they then Murdered Two and Twenty more, and Captived Nine and Twenty of the People; burn't four or five of the best Houses, took much Plunder, and so drew off: but kill'd Mr. <HI>John Broughton</HI> in their drawing off: while Mr. <HI>John Emmerson,</HI> a worthy Preach∣er at <HI>Barwick,</HI> by declining to lodge at the Hospi∣table
<PB N="31" REF="16"/> Majors, that Night, when strongly Invited, received a remarkable Deliverance.

Capt. <HI>Weems,</HI> had but few with him, that were able to <HI>Fight;</HI> and his own Face, was in the <HI>Fight</HI> by an Acci∣dent, horribly Scorched with Gun Powder. Wherefore, the day following, they Surrendred the Fort, upon Capitulations for Life and Liber∣ty; which yet the <HI>Indians</HI> broke, by Butchering and Captiving many of them. Capt. <HI>Skynner</HI> &amp; Capt. <HI>Farnham,</HI> repairing to the Fort, from an Island about half a Mile distant from it, were both Slain, as they Landed on the Rocks; and Mr. <HI>Patishal,</HI> as he lay with his Sloop in the <HI>Bar∣bican,</HI> was also taken and Slain.

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Heard,</HI> a Widow of a Good Estate, a Mother of many Children, and a Daughter of Mr. <HI>Hull,</HI> a Reverend Minister for∣merly Living at <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> now Lived at <HI>Quoche∣cho.</HI> Happening to be at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> on the Day before <HI>Quochecho</HI> was cut off, She Returned thi∣ther in the Night, with one Daughter, and Three Sons all masters of Families. When they came near <HI>Quochecho,</HI> they were astonished, with a pro∣digious Noise of <HI>Indians,</HI> Howling, Shooting, Shouting, and Roaring, according to their man∣ner in making an Assault. Their Distress for their Families carried them still further up the River, till they Secretly and Silently passed by some Numbers of the Raging Salvages. They Landed about an Hundred Rods from Ma∣jor
<PB N="34" REF="18"/> <HI>Walderns</HI> Garrison; and running up the Hill, they saw many Lights in the Windows of the Garrison, which they concluded, the <HI>English</HI> within had set up, for the Direction of those who might seek a Refuge there. Coming to the Gate, they desired entrance; which not be∣ing readily granted, they called Earnestly and bounced, and knocked, and cryed out of their unkindness within, that they would not open to them in this Extremity. No Answer being yet made, they began to doubt, whether all was well; and one of the young men then climbing up the Wall, saw a horrible Tawny in the En∣try, with a Gun in his Hand. A grievous Con∣sternation Siez'd now upon them; and Mrs. <HI>Heard,</HI> sitting down without the Gate, through Dispair and Faintness, unable to Stir any fur∣ther, charg'd her Children to Shift for them∣selves, for She must unavoidably <HI>There</HI> End her Dayes. They finding it impossible to carry her with them, with heavy hearts forsook her; but then coming better to her self, she fled and hid among the <HI>Barberry-Bushes</HI> in the Garden: and then hastning from thence, because the Day-Light advanced, She sheltned her self (though seen by Two of the <HI>Indians,</HI>) in a Thicket of other Bushes, about Thirty Rods from the House. Here she had not been long, before an <HI>Indian</HI> came towards her, with a Pistol in his Hand: The Fellow came up to her, and Stared
<PB N="35" REF="18"/> her in the Face, but said nothing to her, nor she to him. He went a little way back, and came again, and Stared upon her as before, but said nothing; whereupon she asked him, <HI>What he would have?</HI> He still said nothing, but went a∣way to the House, Co hooping, and Returned unto her no more. Being thus unaccountably preserved, She made several Essays to pass the River; but sound her self unable to do it; and finding all places on that side the River, fill'd with Blood and Fire, and hideous Out cryes, thereupon she Returned to her old <HI>Bush,</HI> and there poured out her ardent Prayers to God, for help in this Distress. She continued in the <HI>Bush,</HI> until the Garrison was Burnt, and the Enemy was gone; and then she Stole along by the Ri∣ver side, until she came to a Boom, where she passed over. Many sad Effects of Cruelty, she Saw left by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in her way; until ar∣riving at Captain <HI>Gerrishes</HI> Garrison, she there found a Refuge from the Storm; and here she soon had the Satisfaction, to understand, that her own Garrison, though one of the first that was assaulted, had been bravely Defended and mentained, against the Adversary. This Gen∣tlewomans Garrison, was the most Etxreme Frontier of the Province, and more Obnoxious than any other, and more uncapable of Relief; nevertheless, by her presence and courage, it held out all the <HI>War,</HI> even for <HI>Ten Years</HI> together;
<PB N="36" REF="19"/> and the Persons in it, have Enjoy'd very Emi∣nent preservations. The Garrison had been de∣serted, if <HI>She</HI> had accepted Offers that were made her b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Friends, or Living in more safety at <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> which would have been a Damage to the Town and Land: but by her Encourage∣ment this Post was thus kept; and She is yet Living in much Esteem among her Neighbours.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Sarah Gerish,</HI> Daughter to Captain <HI>John Gerish</HI> of <HI>Quochecho,</HI> a very Beautiful and In∣genious Damsel about Seven years of Age, lodg'd at the Garrison of her affectionate Grand-father, Major <HI>Waldern,</HI> when the Indians brought an horrible Destruction upon it. She was alwayes very Fearful of the <HI>Indians;</HI> but what Fear may we think now Surprised her, when they fiercely bid her go into such a Chamber, and call the People out? Finding only a little Child in the Chamber, she got into the Bed unto the Child, and hid her self in the Cloathes, as well as she could. The Fell Salvages quickly pull'd her out, and made her Dress for a March, but led her a∣way with no more than one Stockin upon her, a terrible March, through the Thick Woods, and a thousand other Miseries, till they came to the <HI>Norway Plains.</HI> From thence they made her go to the end of <HI>Winnopisseag</HI> Lake, and from thence to the Eastward, through horrid Swamps, where sometimes they must Scramble over huge Trees
<PB N="37" REF="19"/> fallen by Storm or Age, for a vast way together, and some times they must Climb up long, steep, tiresome, and almost Inaccessible Mountains. Her First Master was one <HI>Sebundowit,</HI> a Dull sort of a Fellow, and not such a <HI>Devil</HI> as many of 'em were; but he Sold her, to a Fellow that was a more harsh, and mad, sort of a <HI>Dragon;</HI> and he carried her away to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>A long and a sad Journey she had of it, thro' the midst of an hideous <HI>Desart,</HI> in the midst of a dreadful <HI>Winter:</HI> And who can enumerate the Frights, that she endured, before the End of her Journey? Once her Master commanded her to loosen some of her upper-Garments, and stand against a Tree, while he charged his Gun; whereat the poor Child Shrieked out, <HI>He's going to kill me!</HI> God knows what he was going to do; but the Villian having charged his Gun, he call'd her from the Tree, and forbore doing her any Damage. Another Time, her Master or∣dered her to run along the Shore with some In∣dian Girls, while he paddled up the River in his Canoo. As they were upon a praecipice, a Tawny Wench violently push'd her Head long into the River: But it so fell out, that in that very place, the <HI>Bushes</HI> hung over the <HI>Water;</HI> so that getting Hold of them, she Recovered her self. The Indians ask'd her. How she became so wet? but she durst not say, How; through Dread of the young Indians, who were alwayes
<PB N="38" REF="20"/> very Abusive to her, when they had her alone. Moreover, once being spent with Travelling all Day, and lying down Spent and Wet at Night, She fell into into so profound a Sleep, that in the Morning she waked not. The Barbarous Indians left her <HI>Asleep,</HI> and covered with <HI>Snow;</HI> but at length waking, what Agonies may you imagine she was in, to find her self left a prey for <HI>Bears</HI> and <HI>Wolves,</HI> and without any Suste∣nance, in an howling Wilderness many Scores of Leagues, from any Plantation? She Ran crying after them; and Providence having ordered a <HI>Snow</HI> to fall, by means thereof, she Track'd them until she overtook them. Now the young Indians began to Terrify her, with daily Intima∣tions, <HI>That she was quickly to be Roasted unto Death;</HI> and one Evening, much Fuel was prepared, be∣tween Two Logs, which they told her, was for <HI>her.</HI> A mighty Fire being made, her Master call'd her to him, and told her, that she should presently be Burnt alive. At first, she stood Amazed; afterwards she burst into Tears; and then she hung about the Tygre, and begg'd of him, with an inexpressible Anguish, that he would Save her from the Fire. Hereupon the Monster so Relented, as to tell her, <HI>That if she would be a Good Girl, she should not be Burnt.</HI></P>
<P>At last, they arrived at <HI>Canada,</HI> and she was carried unto the <HI>Lord Intendants</HI> House, where many Persons of Quality took much notice of her.
<PB N="39" REF="20"/> It was a Week after this, that she remained in the <HI>Indian</HI> Hands, before the price of her Ransome could be agreed on. But then the <HI>Lady Inten∣dant</HI> sent her to the <HI>Nunnery,</HI> where she was com∣fortably provided for; and it was the Design, as was said, for to have brought her up, in the <HI>Ro∣mish Religion,</HI> and then have Married her unto the Son of the <HI>Lord Intendant.</HI> She was kindly used there, until Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> lying before <HI>Quebeck,</HI> did upon Exchange of Prisoners, obtain her Liberty. After Sixteen Months Captivity, she was Restored unto her Friends; who had the Consolation of having this their Desireable Daughter again with them, Returned from the <HI>Dead;</HI> But coming to be Sixteen years old, in the Month of <HI>July</HI> 1697. <HI>Death,</HI> by a malignant Feavour, more Irrecoverably took her from them.</P>

<PB N="40" REF="21"/> many men, belong'd unto Lieut. <HI>Huckins's</HI> Garri∣son: and seeing 'em all go out unto their daily work, nimbly ran so between them and the Gar∣rison, as to kill 'em all (about Eighteen) but one, who being accidentally gone over the River, escaped them. They then Attacqued the Garri∣son, in which there now were only Two <HI>Boyes,</HI> (and one of <HI>them</HI> Lame) with some Women and Children; but these Two <HI>Boyes,</HI> very <HI>Man∣fully</HI> held 'em in play a Considerable while, and wounded several of them, and kept 'em off, till the Assailants had found a way to set the House on a Light Fire over their Heads.

But while the Forces now gone into the East, were Settling of <HI>Garrisons</HI> in con∣venient places, a huge Body of <HI>Indians,</HI> fell upon <HI>Casco,</HI> where one of their first Exploits, was their killing of Capt. <HI>Bracket.</HI> Ne∣vertheless, Capt. <HI>Hall,</HI> (a valiant <HI>Souldier</HI> in the Former War, and a valiant <HI>Commander</HI> in <HI>This</HI>)

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>MOnsieur <HI>Vincelotte</HI> of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> arrived here, the 25th. of the last Month, and since Embarked for <HI>France,</HI> by way of <HI>Bilboa,</HI> as A∣gent to Represent the Affairs of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>He sayes, That about Nine or Ten years since, the Earl of <HI>Frontenac,</HI> Governour of that place (who dyed last <HI>November,</HI>) did personally Attempt to Subdue, the <HI>Maquas, &amp;c.</HI> having no less than <HI>Fifteen Hundred</HI> Souldiers in his Army.</P>
<P>After a few Dayes March, they (being much <HI>Wearied</HI> and very <HI>Thirsty</HI>) came unto a certain small <HI>Well,</HI> of which they drank very plentifully. But in a few Hours after, sundry complained of much <HI>Illness,</HI> and according to their <HI>various Constitutions</HI> fell Sick (as it seem'd) of <HI>different Distempers;</HI> which occasioned so great Disorder and Confusion in the Army, that no less than <HI>Four</HI> well men, for a while, were Engaged in taking care of every <HI>one</HI> that was Sick. About Three Dayes after, the <HI>Ma∣qua</HI> Scout, narrowly observing the Motions of the <HI>French,</HI> rallyed together, as many as possible, to give a Check unto their Undertaking; which they soon accomplished, with very con∣siderable Advantage. But the <HI>French</HI> appearing so Numerous, forced them to Retreat, and in pursuit of them, took and ransackt a <HI>Small Town.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sickness</HI> by this Time increased unto so great an Height, as to occasion a <HI>Council of War,</HI> which ordered their speedy Return; and in a
<PB N="44" REF="23"/> short Time, no Less than <HI>Eight Hundred</HI> per∣sons Dyed out of the Army.</P>
<P>Now about <HI>Three Years</HI> ago, a certain Soul∣dier, who belong'd at that Time to the Army, went into <HI>France.</HI> In a short Time after his Arrival, he <HI>Robb'd</HI> one of the <HI>Churches,</HI> of a considerable value of <HI>Plate;</HI> but being soon discovered, he was Sentenced to be <HI>Burnt:</HI> He then sent unto sundry <HI>Father-Confessors,</HI> unto whom he acknowledged his <HI>many Sins;</HI> parti∣cularly, that <HI>Fact</HI> for which he was Condemn∣ed. But he therewithal said, That he had <HI>something else</HI> of more considerable moment to Impart, which did much afflict his Conscience; Namely, an Action of his, about <HI>Seven</HI> Years before committed, when Listed under the Conduct of the Earl of <HI>Frontenac,</HI> in an Enter∣prize against the <HI>Sennakers</HI> and <HI>Maquas'; For,</HI> said he) <HI>I was the only person at that Time In∣strumental to the Death of near Eight Hundred Souls. Having Received some Affront, from some of the Officers, I was prompted to seek some speedy Revenge, which my own corrupt Nature with the Instigation of Satan, did instantly accomplish; for being plentifully stored with some Rank poison upon another account, I threw it all into a Well, of which the Thirsty Army drank freely, and in the Event it proved so fatal unto them.</HI></P>
<P>For the further Confirmation of this Report Monsieur <HI>Vincelotte</HI> at the same Time told me,

<P>THE <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>War,</HI> be again Returning! The year 1690. must begin, very Inaus∣piciously. In <HI>February,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> with <HI>Indians,</HI> made a Descent from <HI>Canada,</HI> upon a Dutch Town called <HI>Schenectada,</HI> Twenty Miles above <HI>Albany</HI> under the Government of <HI>New York;</HI> and in that Surprizing Incursion, they killed about Sixty Persons, whereof one was their Minister, and carried about Half as many into Captivity; but the People there, assisted by the <HI>Maqua's,</HI> pursued them, and Recovered some of their Captives from them. Upon the Advice of this Mischief in the <HI>West,</HI> order was dispatch'd unto Major <HI>Frost,</HI> in the <HI>East,</HI> that the Towns there should stand upon their Guard. The Major did <HI>his</HI> Duty; but <HI>they</HI> did not Theirs: They Dream't that while the Deep Snow of the <HI>Win∣ter</HI> continued, they were Safe enough; but this prov'd as Vain as a <HI>Dream of a Dry Summer.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="24"/> On <HI>March</HI> 18th. the <HI>French,</HI> with <HI>Indians,</HI> being Half one, Half t'other, Half Indianized French, and Half Frenchified Indians, commanded by Monsieur <HI>Artel,</HI> and <HI>Hope-hood,</HI> fell Suddenly upon <HI>Salmon Falls,</HI> destroying the best part of the Town, with Fire and Sword. Near <HI>Thirty</HI> Per∣sons were Slain, and more than <HI>Fifty</HI> were led into what the Reader will by'nd by call, <HI>The worst Captivity in the World.</HI> It would be a <HI>Long</HI> Story to tell, what a particular Share in this Ca∣lamity, fell to the Family of One <HI>Clement Short;</HI> This Honest Man, with his Pious Wife, and Three Children, were kill'd; and Six or Seven of their Children, were made Prisoners: the most of which arrived Safe to <HI>Canada,</HI> through a thousand Hardships; and the most of these were with more than a Thousand Mercies after∣wards Redeemed from <HI>Canada,</HI> unto their Eng∣lish Friends again. But my Readers, will be so Reasonable, as to Excuse me, if I do not men∣tion the Fate of every Family, that hath Suffer∣ed a Share in the Calamity of this grievous <HI>War;</HI> for 'tis impossible that I should <HI>Know All</HI> that hath happened; and it would be improper for me to <HI>Write All</HI> that I know: And very little is the Advantage of having a Name Standing upon Record, only among unhappy <HI>Sufferers.</HI> About Seven Score <HI>English</HI> went out after 'em, and came up with 'em: nevertheless, through the Disadvantages of their <HI>Feet</HI> by the <HI>Snow,</HI> they
<PB N="47" REF="24"/> could make no <HI>Hand</HI> on it. Four or Five of ours were kill'd, and as many of the Enemy; but the Night put an End unto the Action.

Three</HI> Indians hotly pursued one <HI>Thomas Toogood,</HI> and <HI>One</HI> of them overtaking him, while the rest perceiving it, staid behind the Hill, he yielded himself a Prisoner.

<PB N="48" REF="25"/> on their Journey, they came to an Hill, where this man, being through his Corpulency, (for which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he was usually Nicknamed, <HI>Robin Pork</HI>) and an Insupportable and Intolerable <HI>Burden</HI> laid upon his Back, not so able to Travel as the rest, he Absconded.

They then cut a parcel of <HI>Wood,</HI> and bringing it into a plain place, they cut off the <HI>Top</HI> of a small <HI>Red Oak</HI> Tree, Leaving the <HI>Trunk</HI> for a <HI>Stake,</HI> whereto they bound their Sa∣crifice. They first made a Great Fire near this <HI>Tree of Death,</HI> and bringing him unto it, they bid him take his Leave of his Friends; which he did in a doleful manner; no Pen, though made of an <HI>Harpies</HI> Quill, were able to describe the Dolour of it! They then allow'd him a lit∣tle Time, to make his <HI>Prayers,</HI> unto Heaven;
<PB N="49" REF="25"/> which he did with an Extreme Fervency and Agony: Where-upon they bound him to the Stake, and brought the rest of the Prisoners, with their Arms tyed each to other, so setting them round the <HI>Fire.</HI> This being done, they went be∣hind the <HI>Fire,</HI> and thrust it forwards upon the man, with much Laughter and Shouting; and when the <HI>Fire</HI> had burnt some while upon him, even till he was near Stiffled, they pull'd it again from him. They Danced about him, and at every Turn, they did with their knives, cut col∣lops of his <HI>Flesh,</HI> from his Naked Limbs, &amp; throw them with his Blood into his <HI>Face.</HI> When he was Dead, they set his Body down upon the <HI>Glowing Coals,</HI> and left him Tyed with his Back to the Stake; where the English Army soon af∣ter found him.

<PB N="50" REF="26"/> any thing worthy to be call'd <HI>A Digression,</HI> a little <HI>Stand Still,</HI> and with mournful <HI>Hearts,</HI> look upon the Condition of the <HI>Captives</HI> in those cruel <HI>Hands.</HI> Their Condition truly might be Express'd in the Terms of the ancient <HI>Lamentations,</HI> (thus by some Translated,) Lam 4 3. <HI>The Daughter of my People, is in the Hands of the Cruel, that are like the Ostrich in the Wilderness.</HI> Truly, the <HI>Dark places</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> had their Unapproacheable <HI>Kennels,</HI> were <HI>Habitations of Cruelty:</HI> and no words can Sufficiently describe the <HI>Cruelty</HI> undergone by our <HI>Captives</HI> in those <HI>Habitations.</HI> The <HI>Cold,</HI> and <HI>Heat,</HI> and <HI>Hunger,</HI> &amp; <HI>Weariness,</HI> and <HI>Mockings,</HI> and <HI>Scourgings,</HI> and <HI>In∣solencies,</HI> Endured by the <HI>Captives,</HI> would enough deserve the Name of <HI>Cruelty;</HI> but there was this also added unto the rest, that they must ever now and then have their Friends made a <HI>Sacrifice of Devils</HI> before their Eyes, but be afraid of drop∣ping a Tear from those Eyes, lest it should, upon that provocation, be next their own Turn, to be so Barbarously <HI>Sacrificed.</HI> Indeed some <HI>few</HI> of the <HI>Captives,</HI> did very happily Escape from their Barbarous Oppressors, by a <HI>Flight</HI> wisely manag∣ed: and many <HI>more</HI> of them, were Bought by the <HI>French,</HI> who treated them with a Civility ever to be acknowledged, until care was taken to fetch 'em home. Nevertheless, many Scores of them Dyed among the <HI>Indians;</HI> and what usage they had, may be gathered from the following

<P><HI>JAmes Key,</HI> Son to <HI>John Key</HI> of <HI>Quochecho,</HI> was a Child of about Five years of Age, taken Captive, by the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Salmon Falls;</HI> and that Hellish Fellow, <HI>Hope-Hood,</HI> once a Servant of a <HI>Christian Master</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> was become the Master of this <HI>Little Christian.</HI> This Child, Lamenting with Tears the want of his <HI>Parents,</HI> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aster Threatened him with Death, if he did no Re∣frain his Tears; but these Threatenings could not Extinguish the Natural Affections of a Child. Wherefore, upon his Next Lamentations, this Monster Stript him Stark Naked, and lash'd both his Hands round a Tree, and Scourg'd him, so that from the Crown of his Head unto the Sole of his Foot, he was all over Bloody and Swollen: and when he was Tired with laying on his Blows, on the Forlorn Infant, he would lay him on the Ground, with Taunts remembring him of his Parents. In this misery, the poor Creature lay horribly Roaring for diverse Dayes together, while his Master, gratifyed with the <HI>Musick,</HI> lay contriving of New Torments, wherewith to Mar∣tyr him.

<P><HI>MEhetabel Goodwin,</HI> being a Captive among the <HI>Indians,</HI> had with her a Child about Months old; which thro' Hunger &amp; Hard∣ship, <HI>she</HI> being unable to nourish, <HI>it</HI> often made most grievous Ejulations. Her <HI>Indian</HI> Master told her, that if the Child were not quiet, he would soon dispose of it; which caused her to use all possible means, that his <HI>Netop-ship</HI> might
<PB N="53" REF="27"/> not be offended; and sometimes carry it from the Fire, out of his Hearing, where she sat up to the wast, in Snow and Frost, for several Hours, until it was Lull'd asleep. She thus for several dayes preserved the Life of her <HI>Babe,</HI> until he saw cause to Travel with his own <HI>Cabs</HI> farther afield; and then lest he should be Retarded in his Tra∣vel. He violently Snatcht the Babe out of it's Mo∣thers Arms, and before her Face knock out its <HI>Brains,</HI> and stript it of the Few <HI>Rag</HI> it had hither∣to Enjoy'd, and ordered her the Task, to go wash the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oody Cloaths.</HI> Returning from this <HI>Melan∣choly Task,</HI> She found the Infant hanging by the Neck, in a Forked Bough of a <HI>Tree.</HI> She desired leave to lay it in the <HI>Earth;</HI> but he said, <HI>It was better as it was, for now the Wild Beasts would not come at it,</HI> [I am sure, they <HI>had</HI> been at it!] <HI>and she might have the Comfort of seeing it again, if ever they came that way.</HI> The Journey now be∣fore them, was like to be very long, even as far as <HI>Canada,</HI> where his purpose was to make Mer∣chandise of his Captive, and glad was the Cap∣tive of such happy Tidings. But the Desperate length of the <HI>way,</HI> and want of <HI>Food,</HI> and grief of <HI>Mind,</HI> wherewith she now encountred, caused her within a few Dayes to faint under her Dif∣ficulties.

But hearing them call his <HI>Name,</HI> he Returned, and then permitted these his Friends, to Ransome his prisoner from him. After this, being Seated by a River side, they heard several <HI>Guns</HI> go off, on the other side; which they con∣cluded, was from a party of <HI>Albany</HI> Indians, who were Enemies unto these: whereupon this Bold Blade, would needs go in a <HI>Canoo,</HI> to discover what they were. They Fired upon him, and shot through him, and several of his Friends, be∣fore the Discovery could be made unto Satis∣faction. But some Dayes after this, diverse of his Friends, gathered a party to Revenge his Death, on their <HI>Supposed Enemies;</HI> with whom they joined Battel, and fought several Hours,
<PB N="55" REF="28"/> until their <HI>Supposed Enemies,</HI> did <HI>Really</HI> put 'em to the Rout. Among the Captives, which they left in their Fight, one was this poor <HI>Goodwin,</HI> who was <HI>Over joyed</HI> in seeing her self thus at Liberty; but the <HI>Joy</HI> did not last long, for these <HI>Indians</HI> were of the <HI>Same Sort</HI> with the other, and had been by their <HI>own Friends,</HI> thus through a strange <HI>Mistake</HI> set upon. However, this crue, proved more Favourable to her, than the former, and went away Silently with their Booty, being loth to have any <HI>Noise</HI> made of their foul <HI>Mistake.</HI> And yet, a few Dayes after, such an other <HI>Mistake</HI> happened; for, meeting with another party of <HI>Indians,</HI> which they imagined in the <HI>English In∣terests,</HI> they furiously engaged each other, and many were killed and wounded on either side: but they proved a party of the <HI>French Indians,</HI> who took this poor <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and presented her to the French Captain, by whom she was carri∣ed unto <HI>Canada;</HI> where she continued Five years, &amp; then was brought safe Back into <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE VIII.</HI> A Little Account of the Greatest Action, that ever <HI>New England</HI> Attempted.</HEAD>
<P>I have Read or Heard, That when the Insuf∣ferable Abuses, which the English Nation suffered from the <HI>Abbeys,</HI> were in the Parliament complained of, the Total Dissolution of those <HI>Abbeys,</HI> was much forwarded, by a Speech of a Gentleman in the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> to this pur∣pose; That his own House had been much annoy'd by <HI>Rooks</HI> building in a <HI>Tree,</HI> near unto it, and that he had used many ineffectual ways to disturb, and disroost these mischievous <HI>Rooks:</HI> until at Last, he found out an <HI>infallible way</HI> to be delivered from the <HI>Rooks,</HI> and that was to cut down the <HI>Tree</HI> that Lodged 'em. The Di∣stresses into which <HI>New-Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and</HI> was now fallen, made <HI>this</HI> very comparison to be thought of. The <HI>Indian Rooks</HI> grievously infested the Coun∣trey; and while the Country was only on the <HI>Defensive Part,</HI> their <HI>Men</HI> were Thinned, their <HI>Towns</HI> were Broken, and their <HI>Treasures</HI> consu∣med,
<PB N="59" REF="30"/> without any Hope of seeing an End of these Troublesome <HI>Tragedies.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Co∣lonies to the Northward, were the <HI>Tree,</HI> in which those <HI>Rooks</HI> had their <HI>Nests;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> ha∣ving in person first fallen upon the <HI>English</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> it was thought that the <HI>New-Eng∣landers</HI> might very justly take this Occasion, to Reduce those <HI>French</HI> Colonies under the English Government, and so at once take away from all the <HI>Rooks</HI> for ever, all that gave 'em any Ad∣vantage to Infest us. Accordingly, a <HI>Naval Force,</HI> with about Seven Hundred men, under the Conduct of Sr. <HI>William Phips,</HI> was dispatch'd away to <HI>L'accady,</HI> and <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> This Fleet, setting Sail from <HI>New-England, April</HI> 28. 1690. in a Fortnight Arrived at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and Sir <HI>William</HI> having the Fort Surrendred unto him, took Possession of that Province, for the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> But this was only a step towards a far greater Action! There was no Speech about the Methods of Safety made, which did not conclude, with, a, <HI>Delenda est Carthago.</HI> It was become the concurring Resolution, of all <HI>New-England,</HI> with <HI>New-York,</HI> that a vigorous Attack should be made upon <HI>Canada,</HI> at once, both by Sea, and Land. A Fleet of <HI>Thirty Two</HI> Sail, under the Command of Sr. <HI>William Phips,</HI> was Equipp'd at <HI>Boston,</HI> and began their Voyage, <HI>Aug.</HI> 9. and the whole <HI>Matter</HI> was put into <HI>Form,</HI> with so much Contrivance and Caution, and
<PB N="60" REF="31"/> Courage, that nothing but an Evident Hand of <HI>Heaven,</HI> was likely to have given such a <HI>Defeat</HI> unto it, as ha's been indeed generally and Remar∣kably given unto all the Colonies of <HI>America,</HI> when they have Invaded one another. If this Expedition did miscarry, and if <HI>Canada</HI> proved unto <HI>New England,</HI> what it prov'd unto the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> when at their Deserting it, they call'd it, <HI>Il Capo de Nada</HI> or, <HI>The Cape of Nothing</HI> (whence the Name <HI>Canada</HI>) there is no <HI>New Englander,</HI> but what will mentain, that it was with a less Dis∣graceful miscarriage, than what baffled, every one of those, that were made in this War, against the <HI>French Islands,</HI> by more powerful Fleets of those, who were forward Enough to Reproach <HI>New-England.</HI> I am sure, he that Reads the Ac∣count of what was done at <HI>Martineco,</HI> in the <HI>Re∣lation of the Voyage of M.</HI> de Gennes, lately pub∣lished, must be very easy in his Reflections upon what was done at <HI>Canada.</HI> And I will add, That if the <HI>New-England</HI> men return'd <HI>re infecta</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> yet they did not leave Two Hundred men behind them to the mercy of the <HI>French,</HI> as they who most Reproached <HI>New England,</HI> soon after did at <HI>Guadalupa.</HI></P>
<P>The fuller Narrative of these memorable Things, the Reader may find written, in, <HI>The Life of Sir <HI>William Phipps,</HI></HI> lately published; of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch I must here give this Attestation, That as my Acquaintance with the Author, gives me

<PB N="62" REF="32"/>
<P>In the very year, when the <HI>Massachusett</HI>-Colo∣ny began, the English Attempted the Conquest of <HI>Canada,</HI> and though the <HI>First</HI> Attempt miscar∣ried, the <HI>Second</HI> prospered. The Story of it, makes a Chapter, in Father <HI>Hennepins</HI> Account of the Vast Country lately discovered, betwixt <HI>Canada,</HI> and <HI>Mexico:</HI> and this is the Sum of it.</P>
<P>While a Colony was forming it self at <HI>Canada,</HI> an English Fleet was Equipp'd, in the year, 1628. under the Command of Admiral <HI>Kirk,</HI> with a Design to take Possession of that Country. In their Vogage, having taken a French Ship, at the Isle <HI>Percee,</HI> they Sailed up the River, as far as <HI>Tadousac,</HI> where they found a Bark, in which they set ashore some Souldiers, to Seize on Cape <HI>Tourment.</HI> And here a Couple of Salvages dis∣covering them, ran away to advise the people of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> that the English were approaching. When the Fleet arrived, the Admiral Summon∣ed the Town to Surrender by a Letter to Mon∣sieur <HI>Champelin,</HI> the Governour; But the Go∣vernour notwithstanding his being so Surprised with the Invasion, made such a Resolute Answer, that the English, (though as the Historian says, <HI>they are a People that will sooner Dy than quit what they once undertake</HI>) did conclude the Fort <HI>Que∣beck,</HI> was in a much better Condition for De∣fence than it really was; and therefore desisting from any further Attempt at this Time, they returned into <HI>England,</HI> with Resolution further
<PB N="63" REF="32"/> to pursue their Design at a more favourable Op∣portunity.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on <HI>July</HI> 19. 1629. in the Morn∣ing, the <HI>English Fleet</HI> appear'd again, over against the Great Bay of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> at the point of the Isle of <HI>Orleans;</HI> which Fleet Consisted of Three men of War, and Six other Vessels. Admiral <HI>Kirk</HI> sending a Summons form'd in very Civil Expressions, for the Surrender of the Place, the miserable State of the Country, which had been by the English Interceptions, hindred of Supplies from <HI>France,</HI> for Two years together, oblig'd the Sieur <HI>Champelin</HI> to make a softer Answer, than he did before. He sent Father <HI>Joseph Le Caron,</HI> aboard the Admiral to treat about the Surrender, and none of his Demands for Fifteen Dayes, and then for Five Dayes, Time to Consider on't, could obtain any longer Time, than till the E∣vening, to prepare their <HI>Articles.</HI> Upon the De∣livery of this Message, a Council was held, wherein some urged, that the English had no more than Two Hundred men, of Regular Troops aboard, and some others which had not much of the Air of Souldiers; and that the Courage of the Inhabitants was much to be reli∣ed upon, and therefore it was best for to run the risk of a Siege: But Monsieur <HI>Champelin,</HI> apprehending the Bravery of the English, re∣monstrated unto the Council, that it was better to make a Surrender on Good Terms, than be
<PB N="64" REF="33"/> all out in pieces by an unreasonable Endeavour to Defend themselves. Upon this, the Articles regulating all matters, were got ready, and Fa∣ther <HI>Joseph</HI> had his Commission, to carry them aboard the English Admiral, where the <HI>Signing</HI> of them was defe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd until To Morrow. On <HI>July</HI> 20. the Articles of Capitulation were Sign∣ed, on both sides, and the English being Landed, were put in possession of <HI>Canada,</HI> by the Gover∣nour of it. The French Inhabitants, who were then in the Country, had twenty Crowns a piece given them, the rest of their Effects remained unto the Conquerers, but those who were willing to stay, were favoured by the English with great Advantages. The Fleet set Sail again for <HI>Eng∣land, Sept.</HI> 14. and arrived at <HI>Plymouth, Octo.</HI> 18. in that year.</P>

<P>WHen the <HI>Indians</HI> at last perceived that the <HI>New Englanders</HI> were upon a Likely De∣sign to Swallow up the <HI>French</HI> Territories, the <HI>Prospect</HI> of it began to have the same Operati∣on upon them, that the <HI>Success</HI> of the Design, would have made <HI>Perpetual;</HI> that is, to Dispirit them, for giving the <HI>New Englanders</HI> any further Molestations. Nevertheless, <HI>Before</HI> and <HI>Until,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="33"/> they were thoroughly Advised of what was a doing, and likely to be done, they did molest the Country with some Tragical Efforts of their Fury. Captain <HI>James Convers</HI> was Marching through the vast Wilderness, to <HI>Albany,</HI> with some Forces, which the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony were willing to send by Land (besides what they did send by <HI>Sea</HI> unto <HI>Quebeck,</HI>) for the Assistence of the Army, in the <HI>West,</HI> that was to go from thence over the <HI>Lake,</HI> and there fall upon <HI>Mount Real:</HI> but unhappy Tidings out of the <HI>East</HI> required the Diversion of those Forces thither. About the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the French and Indians, be∣tween Four and Five Hundred, were seen at <HI>Casco,</HI> in a great Fleet of <HI>Canoo's</HI> passing over the Bay: but not Seeing or Hearing any more of them, for Two or Three Weeks together, the <HI>Casconians</HI> flattered themselves with Hopes, That they were gone another way. But about <HI>May</HI> 16 those Hopes were over; For one <HI>Gresson,</HI> a Scotchman, then going out Early, sell into the mouths of these Hungry Salvages. It proved no kindness to <HI>Casco,</HI> tho' it proved a great one to <HI>himself,</HI> that a Commander so qualified, as Captain <HI>Willard,</HI> was called off, Two or Three Dayes be∣fore. But, The Officers of the place, now con∣cluding, that the whole <HI>Army</HI> of the Enemy, were watching for an Advantage to Surprize the Town, Resolved that they would keep a Strict watch, for Two or Three dayes, to make some further
<PB N="66" REF="34"/> Discovery, before they Salley'd forth. Notwith∣standing this, one Lieut. <HI>Clark,</HI> with near Thirty of their Stoutest young men, would venture out, as far as the Top of an Hill, in the Entrance of the <HI>Wood,</HI> half a mile distant from the Town. The out-let from the Town to the <HI>Wood,</HI> was thro' a Lane, that had a Fence on each side, which had a certain <HI>Block-house</HI> at one End of it: and the <HI>English</HI> were Suspicious, when they came to Enter the <HI>Lane,</HI> that the <HI>Indians</HI> were lying behind the <HI>Fence,</HI> because the <HI>Cattel</HI> stood staring that way, and would not pass into the <HI>Wood</HI> as they use to do. This mettlesome Company, then ran up to the Fence, with an, <HI>Huzzab!</HI> thinking thereby to discourage the Enemy, if they should be lurking there: but the Enemy were so well prepared for them, that they answered them with an horrible Vengeance, which kill'd the Lieutenant, with Thirteen more upon the Spot, and the rest escaped with much ado unto one of the Garri∣sons. The Enemy then coming into Town, be∣set all the <HI>Garrisons</HI> at once, Except the <HI>Fort;</HI> which were manfully Defended, so long as their Ammunition lasted; but That being spent, with∣out a prospect of a Recruit, they quitted all the Four <HI>Garrisons,</HI> and by the Advantage of the Night, got into the <HI>Fort.</HI> Upon this, the Enemy Setting the Town on Fire, bent their whole Force against the <HI>Fort,</HI> which had hard by it, a deep <HI>Gully,</HI> that contributed not a little unto the Ruin

Articles were Agreed, That they should have liberty to March unto the Next English Town, and have a Guard for their Safety in their March; and the <HI>French Commander,</HI> lift∣ing up his Hand, Swore by the Everlasting God, for the performance of these Articles. But the Agreement was kept, as those that are made with <HI>Hugonots</HI> use to be: The English being first Ad∣monished, by the <HI>French,</HI> that they were all <HI>Re∣bels,</HI> for proclaming the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> their King, were Captived, and many of them cruelly Murdered by the <HI>Indians:</HI> Only some of them (and particularly, Major <HI>Davis,</HI>) were Carried unto <HI>Canada,</HI> where the Gentry, very civilly Treated them. The Garrisons at <HI>Papoodack, Spurwink, Black Point,</HI> and <HI>Blue Point,</HI> were so disanimated at these Disasters, that, without <HI>Or∣ders</HI> they drew off immediately, to <HI>Saco,</HI> Twen∣ty miles, within <HI>Casco,</HI> and from <HI>Saco</HI> in a few Dayes also they drew off to <HI>Wells,</HI> Twenty miles within the said <HI>Saco;</HI> and about Half <HI>Wells</HI> drew off as far as Lieut. <HI>Storers.</HI> But the Arrival of <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Souldiers</HI> from the Government, stopt

<P>THat memorable Tygre, <HI>Hope-Hood,</HI> (called also, <HI>Wohawa,</HI>) finding the Coast herea∣bouts too hot for him, went away with his Crue, a great way to the <HI>West-ward,</HI> with a Design to Be∣witch another Crue at <HI>Aquadocta</HI> into his Assistence. Here a party of <HI>French Indians,</HI> by a strange Mistake, supposing <HI>Hope Hood,</HI> &amp; his Wretches, to have been the <HI>Indians,</HI> who had lately done some Spoil upon them at <HI>Canada,</HI> furiously fell upon them, and in their <HI>Blind Fury</HI> slew him, and a considerable part of his Company.

About this Time, a <HI>Council of War,</HI> was called, at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> by which t'was thought adviseable, to
<PB N="70" REF="36"/> send out Captain <HI>Wiswel,</HI> with a considerable Scout for to Scour the Woods, as far as <HI>Casco:</HI> and it being Resolved, That one of the other Captains with about Fourscore Stout men should accom∣pany Captain <HI>Wiswal</HI> in this Action, they <HI>All</HI> with such a Generous Emulation offered it, that it was necessary to determine it by a <HI>Lot,</HI> which fell upon Captain <HI>Floyd.</HI> On <HI>July</HI> 4. assisted with Lieut. <HI>Andrews,</HI> and a Detachment of Twenty Two men from <HI>Wells,</HI> they took their March from <HI>Quochecho,</HI> into the Woods. But the Day following, the Enemy set upon Captain <HI>Hiltons</HI> Garrison in <HI>Exeter,</HI> which Lieut. <HI>Bancroft,</HI> then posted at <HI>Exeter,</HI> with the loss of a few of his men, Relieved. At this Time, there happened a Remarkable Thing. I know not whether the Story told by <HI>Plato</HI> be true, That one <HI>Herus Ar∣menius</HI> (whom <HI>Clemens</HI> will have to be <HI>Zoroaster</HI>) being Slain in War, lay Ten Days among the Dead, and then being brought away, and on the Twelfth Day laid on the Funeral Pile, he came to Life again. But it is true, that one <HI>Simon Stone</HI> being here wounded with Shot, in <HI>Nine</HI> several places, lay for <HI>Dead,</HI> (as it was Time!) among the <HI>Dead.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> coming to Strip him, at∣tempted, with <HI>Two</HI> several Blows of an Hatchet at his <HI>Neck,</HI> to cut off his <HI>Head,</HI> which Blows added, you may be sure, more Enormous wounds unto those <HI>Port-holes</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> at which the <HI>Life</HI> of the poor man, was already running out, as fast
<PB N="71" REF="36"/> as it could. Being charged hard by Lieut. <HI>Ban∣croft,</HI> they left the man, without <HI>Scalping</HI> him; and the English now coming to Bury the <HI>Dead,</HI> one of the Souldiers perceived this poor man to fetch a gasp: whereupon an <HI>Irish</HI> Fellow then present, advised 'em, to give him another Dab with an Hatchet, and so Bury him with the rest. The English detesting this Barbarous Advice, lifted up the wounded man, and poured a little <HI>Fair Water</HI> into his Mouth, at which he Coughed; then they poured a little <HI>Strong Water</HI> alter it, at which he opened his Eyes. The <HI>Irish</HI> Fellow was ordered now to hale a Canoo ashore, to car∣ry the wounded men up the River, unto a Cheirurgeon; and as Teague was foolishly pull∣ing the Canoo ashore, with the Cock of his <HI>Gun,</HI> while he held the Muzzle in his <HI>Hand,</HI> his Gun went off, and broke his <HI>Arm,</HI> whereof he remains a Creeple to <HI>this Day:</HI> But <HI>Simon Stone</HI> was tho∣roughly cured, and is at <HI>this Day</HI> a very lusty man, and as he was Born with <HI>Two Thumbs</HI> on one Hand, his Neighbours have thought him to have at least as many <HI>Hearts</HI> as <HI>Thumbs!</HI></P>
<P>Reader, Let us Leave it now unto the Sons of <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> to Dispute out the Problem, <HI>What Wounds are to be Judged Mortal?</HI> The So∣vereign Arbiter of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> seems to have determined it, <HI>That no Wounds are Mortal, but such as He shall in His Holy Providence Actually make so.</HI> On the one side, Let it be Remem∣bred,
<PB N="72" REF="37"/> That a Scratch of a <HI>Comb</HI> has proved <HI>Mor∣tal;</HI> That the Incomparable Anatomist <HI>Spige∣lius,</HI> at the Wedding of his Daughter, gathering up the Reliques of a Broken Glass, a Fragment of it scratched one of his Fingers; and all his Exquisite Skill in <HI>Anatomy,</HI> could not prevent its producing an <HI>Empyema,</HI> that Killed him: That Colonel <HI>Rossiter,</HI> cracking a Plumbstone with his Teeth, broke his Tooth, and Lost his <HI>Life;</HI> That the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> cutting a <HI>Corn,</HI> in his Foot, Cut asunder the <HI>Threed</HI> of his <HI>Life;</HI> That Mr. <HI>Fowler,</HI> a Vintner, playing with his Child, received a little scratch of a <HI>Pin,</HI> which turn'd unto a <HI>Gangrene,</HI> that Cost him his Life.

Captain <HI>Floyd</HI> maintained the Fight, after the Death of Captain <HI>Wiswal,</HI> several Hours, until so many of his Tired and Wounded men Drew off, that it was Time for him to Draw off also; for which he was blamed perhaps, by some that would not have continued at it so long as <HI>he.</HI> Hereupon Captain <HI>Convers</HI> repaired, with about a score Hands to look after the <HI>Wounded</HI> men, and finding seven yet <HI>Alive,</HI> he brought 'em to the <HI>Hospital,</HI> by Sun-rise the next morning.

<P>The Enemy appearing a Little Numerous and Vexatious, the Government sent more For∣ces to break up the Enemies Quarters; and Auxiliaries both of English and Indians, under the Command of Major <HI>Church,</HI> assisted the Enterprize. About Three Hundred Men, were dispatched away upon this Design, in the Be∣ginning of <HI>September,</HI> who Landed by Night in <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> at a place called, <HI>Macquoit,</HI> and by Night Marched up to <HI>Pechypscot Fort;</HI> where, from the Information of some Escaped <HI>Captives,</HI> they had an Expectation to meet with the Ene∣my; but found that the Wretches were gone farther a field. They then marched away for <HI>Amonoscoggin</HI> Fort, which was about Forty Miles up the River, and Wading through many <HI>Diffi∣culties,</HI> whereof one was a <HI>Branch</HI> of the River it self, they met with Four or Five <HI>Salvages,</HI> go∣ing to their Fort, with two English Prisoners. They Sav'd the <HI>Prisoners,</HI> but could not catch the <HI>Salvages;</HI> however, on the <HI>Lords-Day</HI> they got up to the Fort undiscovered, where to their Sorrow∣ful Disappointment, they found no more than one and Twenty of the Enemy, whereof they Took and Slew Twenty. They found some Conside∣rable Store of <HI>Plunder,</HI> and Rescued Five <HI>English Captives,</HI> and laid the Fort in Ashes: but one
<PB N="77" REF="39"/> Disaster they much Complained of; That the Captain of the Fort, whose Name was <HI>Agamcus,</HI> alias, <HI>Great Tom,</HI> slipt away from the Hands of his too <HI>Careless</HI> keepers. But if this piece of <HI>Carelessness</HI> did any <HI>Harm,</HI> there was another which did some <HI>Good:</HI> For, <HI>Great Tom</HI> having terribly Sca∣red a party of his Country-men, with the Tidings of what had happened; and an English Lad in their Hands also telling some Truth unto them, they betook themselves to such a <HI>Flight,</HI> in their <HI>Fright,</HI> as gave one Mr. <HI>Anthony Bracket,</HI> then a Prisoner with 'em, an Opportunity to Flie Four∣score miles another way. Our Forces returning to <HI>Mackquoit,</HI> one of our Vessels was there <HI>Care∣lesly</HI> run <HI>a ground,</HI> and compelled thereby to stay for the next Tide: and Mr. <HI>Bracket,</HI> had been miserably <HI>a ground,</HI> if it had not so fell out; for he thereby got thither before she was afloat; o∣therwise <HI>he</HI> might have perished, who was after∣wards much Improved in Service against the Murderers of his Father. Arriving at <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> a party of men were sent up the River, who coming upon a parcel of the <HI>Mankeen Wolves,</HI> then hunted for, killed some of them, and Siezed most of their Arms, and Stores, and Re∣covered from them an <HI>English man,</HI> who told them, that the Enemy were intending to Ren∣dezvouze on <HI>Pechypscot Plain,</HI> in order to an At∣tempt upon the Town of <HI>Wells.</HI> Upon this, they Re imbark'd for <HI>Macquoit,</HI> and repaired as fast
<PB N="78" REF="40"/> as they could unto <HI>Pechypscot Plain,</HI> and being Divided into Three parties, they there <HI>waited</HI> for the Approach of the Enemy. But being tyred with one of the Three <HI>Italian</HI> miseries, <HI>Waiting for those who did not come,</HI> they only possessed themselves of more Plunder there hid by the E∣nemy, and returned unto <HI>Casco</HI>-Harbor. The Enemy it seems <HI>dogg'd</HI> their Motions; and in the Night they made a mischievous Assault upon such of the English Army, as were too Remiss, in providing for their own Safety, in their going ashore; Killing, Five of our <HI>Plymouth</HI>-Friends, who had Lodg'd themselves in an House, without <HI>Commanders</HI> or <HI>Centinels.</HI> The English as soon as the Light of the Day, (which was the <HI>Lords-Day, Sept.</HI> 21.) gave 'em leave, quickly Ran upon the Enemy, and Eased the world of some of them, and made the rest Scamper from that part of the world, and got many of their Canoo's, and not a little of their Ammunition, and their best Fur∣niture for the Winter. The Army was after this Dismiss'd; only an Hundred men, were left, with Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Plaisted,</HI> who spent their Time, as profitably as they could, in Scouting about the Frontiers, to prevent Sur∣prizals, from an Enemy which rarely did <HI>Annoy,</HI> but when they could <HI>Surprize.</HI></P>

<P>BUt the <HI>Winter</HI> must not pass over, without a <HI>Storm</HI> of Blood! The Popish <HI>Indians,</HI> after long Silence and Repose, in their <HI>Inaccessible Ken∣nels,</HI> which made our Frontier Towns, a little Re∣mit their Tired Vigilance, did, <HI>Janu.</HI> 25. 1691. Set upon the Town of <HI>York,</HI> where the Inhabitants were in their unguarded Houses, here and there Scattered, <HI>Quiet and Secure.</HI> Upon the Firing of a <HI>Gun</HI> by the <HI>Indians,</HI> which was their <HI>Signal,</HI> the Inhabitants looked out, but unto their Amaze∣ment, found their Houses to be Invested with horrid <HI>Salvages,</HI> who immediately kill'd many of
<PB N="84" REF="43"/> those unprovided Inhabitants, and more they took Prisoners. This Body of <HI>Indians,</HI> Consist∣ing of diverse Hundreds, then sent in their <HI>Sum∣mons,</HI> to some of the <HI>Garrison'd Houses;</HI> and those <HI>Garrisons</HI> whereof some had no more than Two or Three <HI>Men</HI> in them, yet being so well <HI>Mann'd,</HI> as to Reply, <HI>That they would Spend their Blood unto the last Drop, e're they would Surrender;</HI> these Cowardly Miscreants had not mettle enough to meddle with 'em. So they Retired into their Howling Thickets, having first <HI>Murdered</HI> about <HI>Fifty,</HI> and <HI>Captived</HI> near an <HI>Hundred,</HI> of that un∣happy People. In this Calamity, great was the Share, that fell to the Family of Mr. SHUBAEL DUMMER, the Pastor of the <HI>Little Flock</HI> thus prey'd upon Those Blood-Hounds, being set on by some <HI>Romish Missionaries,</HI> had long been wishing, that they might Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e their Hands, in the Blood of some <HI>New English MINISTER;</HI> and in this Action, they had their Diabolical Sa∣tisfaction. Our <HI>Dummer,</HI> the Minister of <HI>York,</HI> was One, of whom, for his Exemplary Holin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Humbleness, Modesty, Industry, and Fidelity, <HI>The World was not Worthy.</HI> He was a Gentleman <HI>Well</HI>-Descended, <HI>Well</HI>-Tempered, <HI>Well</HI>-Educated; and now short of Sixty years of Age. He might have taken for his <HI>Coat of Arms,</HI> the same that the Holy Martyr <HI>Hooper</HI> Prophetically did, <HI>A Lamb in a Flaming Bush, with Rayes from Heaven shining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it.</HI> He had been Sollicited with many
<PB N="85" REF="43"/> Temptations, to <HI>Leave his Place,</HI> when the Clouds grew Thick and Black, in the <HI>Indian Hostilities,</HI> and were like to break upon it; but he chose rather, with a paternal Affection to stay a∣mongst those, who had been, so many of them, Converted and Edified by his Ministry; and he spent very much of his own <HI>Patramony</HI> to Subsist among them, when their Distresses made them unable to support him, as otherwise they would have done. In a word, He was one that might, by way of Eminency, be called, <HI>A Good Man.</HI> This <HI>Good Man</HI> was just going to Take Horse, at his own Door, upon a Journey in the Service of God, when the <HI>Tygres,</HI> that were making their Depredations upon the <HI>Sheep</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> Siez'd upon this their <HI>Shepherd;</HI> &amp; they shot him so, that they left him Dead among the Tribe of <HI>Abel,</HI> on the Ground. Thus was he, as <HI>Ambrose</HI> in his Elegant Oration, <HI>De obitu Fratris,</HI> Expresses it, <HI>Non nobis ereptus, sed periculis.</HI> His <HI>Wife</HI> they carried into Captivity, where through Sorrows and Hardships among those <HI>Dragons of the De∣sart,</HI> she also quickly Dyed; and his <HI>Church,</HI> as many of them, as were in that Captivity, Endur∣ed This, among other Anguishes, that on the Next <HI>Lord Day,</HI> one of the Tawnies, chose to Ex∣hibit himself unto them, <HI>[A Devil as an Angel of Light!]</HI> in the <HI>Cloaths,</HI> whereof they had Stript the Dead Body of this their <HI>Father.</HI> Many were the <HI>Tears,</HI> that were dropt throughout <HI>New-England,</HI>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE. XVI.</HI> The Memorable Action at <HI>Wells.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Vessel, the Name whereof I know not, [Reader, Let it be, <HI>The Charity,</HI>] being immediately dispatched unto <HI>Sagadehock,</HI> by the <HI>Charitable Compassions</HI> of the more Southward Neighbours, with Effects to accomplish it, hap∣pily Effected the Redemption of many that were taken Captives at <HI>York.</HI> But the rest of the Peo∣ple in that Broken Town, talking of Drawing off, the Government sent Captain <HI>Convers</HI> and Captain <HI>Greenleaf,</HI> with such Encouragements unto them, to keep their <HI>Station,</HI> as prevailed with 'em still to <HI>Stand</HI> their Ground. In <HI>February</HI> Major <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> was made Commander in Chief, &amp; Forces under the Command of Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> Captain <HI>Floyd,</HI> and Captain <HI>Thaxter,</HI> were by him so prudently posted, on the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> that by mentaining a continual Communication, it be∣came a Difficult Thing for the Enemy to make any more Approaches. Lieutenant <HI>Wilson</HI> parti∣cularly hearing of a man Shot at, in <HI>Quochecho</HI>-Woods, went out with a Scout of about Eighteen men, who came upon the <HI>Indians</HI> that had shot at the man; and killed and wounded <HI>all</HI> but <HI>one,</HI> of the whole Company. But now, <HI>Reader,</HI> the <HI>Longest Day</HI> in the <HI>Year</HI> is come on, and, it I
<PB N="88" REF="45"/> mistake not, the <HI>Bravest Act</HI> in the <HI>War,</HI> fell out upon it. <HI>Modockawando</HI> is now come, according to his Promise a Twelve Month ago. Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> was lodg'd in <HI>Storers</HI> Garrison at <HI>Wells,</HI> with but Fifteen men; and there came into <HI>Wells,</HI> Two Sloops, with a Shallop, which had aboard Supplies of <HI>Ammunition</HI> for the Souldiers, and <HI>Contribution</HI> for the Needy. The <HI>Cattel</HI> this Day came <HI>Frighted,</HI> and <HI>Bleeding</HI> but of the Woods, which was a more certain <HI>Omen</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> a coming, than all the <HI>Prodigies</HI> that <HI>Livy</HI> reports of the <HI>Sacrificed Oxen. Convers</HI> immediately issued out his Commands unto all Quarters, but especi∣ally to the <HI>Sloops</HI> just then arrived. The <HI>Sloops</HI> were Commanded by <HI>Samuel Storer,</HI> and <HI>James Gouge,</HI> and <HI>Gouges</HI> being Two miles up the <HI>River,</HI> he wisely brought her down undiscovered, unto <HI>Storers,</HI> by the advantage of a Mist then prevail∣ing. A careful <HI>Night,</HI> they had on't! The next <HI>Morning,</HI> before <HI>Day-Light,</HI> one <HI>John Dia∣mond,</HI> a Stranger that came in the Shallop on a Visit, came to Captain <HI>Conver's</HI> Garrison, where the Watch invited him in; but he chose rather to go aboard the Sloops, which were little more than a Gun-shot off; and, alas, the Enemy issu∣ing out from their Lurking places, immediately Siez'd him, and haled him away by the Hair of the Head, (in spite of all Attempts used by the Garrison, to Recover him) for an <HI>horrible Story,</HI> to be told by'nd by concerning him. The Gene∣ral
<PB N="89" REF="45"/> of the Enemies Army was Monsieur <HI>Burniff;</HI> and one Monsieur <HI>Labrocree</HI> was a principal Commander; (the Enemy said, he was Lieute∣nant General:) There were also Diverse other Frenchmen of Quality; Accompanied with <HI>Mo∣dockawando,</HI> and <HI>Moxus,</HI> and <HI>Egeremet,</HI> and <HI>Warum∣bo,</HI> and several more Indian Sagamores; The Army made up in all, about Five Hundred <HI>Men,</HI> or Fierce Things in the Shape of <HI>Men;</HI> all, to Encounter Fifteen <HI>Men,</HI> in one little <HI>Garrison,</HI> &amp; about Fifteen more <HI>Men,</HI> [worthily called <HI>Such!</HI>] in a Couple of open <HI>Sloops. Diamond</HI> having in∣formed 'em, <HI>How t'was,</HI> in all points, (only that for <HI>Fifteen,</HI> by a mistake he said, <HI>Thirty,</HI>) they fell to Dividing the Persons and Plunder, and A∣greeing, that such an <HI>English Captain,</HI> should be Slave to such a one, and such a Gentleman in the Town should serve such a one, and his <HI>Wife</HI> be a <HI>Maid of Honour,</HI> to such or such a <HI>Squaw</HI> proposed, and Mr. <HI>Wheelright</HI> (instead of being a Worthy Counsellor of the Province, which he <HI>Now</HI> is!) was to be the Servant of such a <HI>Netop;</HI> and the <HI>Sloops,</HI> with their <HI>Stores,</HI> to be so and so parted among them. There wanted but <HI>One Thing</HI> to Consummate the whole matter, even, the <HI>Chief Thing</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all, which I suppose they had not thought of; That was, For <HI>Heaven</HI> to Deli∣ver all this prize into their Hands: But, <HI>Aliter Statutum est in Caelo!</HI> A man Habited, like a Gentleman, made a <HI>Speech</HI> to them in English;
<PB N="90" REF="46"/> Exhorting 'em to Courage, and Assuring 'em, that if they would Courageously fall upon the English, all was their own. The <HI>Speech</HI> being Ended, they fell to the <HI>Work,</HI> and with an horrid Shout and Shot, made their Assault, upon the Feeble <HI>Garrison:</HI> but the English answered with a brisk Volley, and sent such a Leaden Showre among them, that they retired from the <HI>Garri∣son</HI> to spend the Storm of their Fury upon the <HI>Sloops.</HI> You must know, That <HI>Wells-Harbour</HI> is rather a <HI>Creek</HI> than a <HI>River,</HI> for 'tis very Nar∣row, and at low water, in many places <HI>Dry:</HI> nevertheless, where the Vessels ride, it is <HI>Deep</HI> enough, and so far off the Bank, that there is from thence no Leaping aboard. But our <HI>Sloops</HI> were sorely incommoded, by a Turn of the <HI>Creek,</HI> where the Enemy could ly out of danger, so near 'em, as to throw Mud aboard with their Hands. The Enemy was also privi∣ledged with a Great Heap of <HI>Plank,</HI> lying on the Bank, and with an <HI>Hay Stock,</HI> which they Streng∣thened with <HI>Posts,</HI> and <HI>Rayles;</HI> and from all these places, they poured in their Vengeance upon the poor <HI>Sloops,</HI> while they so placed Smaller parties of their Salvages, as to make it impossible for any of the Garrisons, to afford 'em any relief. Lying thus, within a Dozen yards of the <HI>Sloops,</HI> they did with their <HI>Fire Arrows,</HI> diverse times desperately set the <HI>Sloops</HI> on Fire: but the brave Defendents, with a <HI>Swab,</HI> at the End of a <HI>Rope,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="46"/> tyed unto a <HI>Pole,</HI> and so dip't into the <HI>Water,</HI> happily put the Fire out. In brief the <HI>Sloops</HI> gave the Enemy so brave a Repulse, that at Night they Retreated: when they Renewed their Assault, finding that their <HI>Fortitude</HI> would not assure the Success of the Assault unto them, they had recourse unto their <HI>Policy.</HI> First, an <HI>Indian</HI> comes on, with a <HI>Slab,</HI> for a <HI>Shield,</HI> before him; when a Shot from one of the <HI>Sloops,</HI> pierc∣ed the <HI>Slab,</HI> which fell down, instead of a <HI>Tomb∣stone</HI> with the Dead <HI>Indian</HI> under it: on which, as little a Fellow as he was, I know not whe∣ther some will not reckon it proper to inscribe the <HI>Epitaph,</HI> which the <HI>Italians</HI> use to bestow upon their <HI>Dead Popes; When the Dog is Dead, all his Malice is Dead with him.</HI> Their next <HI>Stra∣tagem</HI> was This: They brought out of the Woods, a kind of a <HI>Cart,</HI> which they Trim'd, and Rigg'd, and Fitted up into a Thing, that might be called, <HI>A Chariot:</HI> whereon they built a platform, shot∣proof in the Front, and placed many men upon that platform. Such an Engine they understood how to Shape, without having Read, (I suppose) the Description of the <HI>Pluteus</HI> in <HI>Vegetius!</HI> This <HI>Chariot</HI> they push'd on, towards the <HI>Sloops,</HI> till they were got, it may be, within <HI>Fifteen yards</HI> of them; when, lo, one of the <HI>Wheels</HI> to their Admiration Sunk into the Ground. A <HI>French∣man</HI> Stepping to heave the <HI>Wheel,</HI> with an Help∣ful Shoulder, <HI>Storer</HI> Shot <HI>him</HI> down; Another
<PB N="92" REF="47"/> Stepping to the <HI>Wheel, Storer</HI> with a well placed Shot, sent <HI>him</HI> after his <HI>Mate:</HI> So the Rest thought, it was best let it stand as it was. The Enemy kept Galling the <HI>Sloops,</HI> from their Several Batte∣ries, and calling 'em to Surrender, with many fine promises to make them <HI>Happy,</HI> which ours answered with a just <HI>Laughter,</HI> that had now and then a mortiferous <HI>Bullet</HI> at the End of it. The Tide Rising, the <HI>Chariot</HI> overset, so that the men behind it lay open to the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which im∣mediately Dispensed an horrible Slaughter among them; and they that could get away, got as fast, and as far off, as they could. In the Night, the Enemy had much Discourse with the <HI>Sloops;</HI> they Enquired, <HI>Who were their Commanders?</HI> and the English gave an Answer, which in some other Cases, and Places, would have been too true, <HI>That they had a great many Commanders:</HI> but the Indians Replyed, <HI>You ly, you have none but</HI> Convers, <HI>and we will have him too before Morning!</HI> They also knowing, that the <HI>Magazine</HI> was in the <HI>Garrison,</HI> lay under an Hill-Side, Pelting at <HI>That,</HI> by Times; but Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> once in the Night, sent out Three or Four of his men, into a Field of Wheat, for a <HI>Shot,</HI> if they could get one. <HI>There</HI> seeing a <HI>Black Heap</HI> lying together, Ours all at once let Fly upon them, a <HI>Shot,</HI> that Slew several of them that were thus <HI>Caught in that Corn,</HI> and made the rest glad, that they found themselves Able to Run for it. Captain <HI>Convers</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="47"/> was this while in much Distress, about a <HI>Scout</HI> of Six men, which he had sent forth to <HI>Newicha∣wannick,</HI> the Morning before the Arrival of the Enemy, ordering them to <HI>Return</HI> the Day follow∣ing. The Scout <HI>Return'd,</HI> into the very Mouth of the Enemy, that lay before the Garrison; but the <HI>Corporal,</HI> having his Wits about him, call'd out aloud, (as if he had seen Captain <HI>Convers</HI> making a Salley forth upon 'em,) <HI>Captain, Wheel about your men round the Hill, and we shall Catch 'em, there are but a Few Rogues of 'em!</HI> Upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> imagining, that Captain <HI>Con∣vers</HI> had been at their <HI>Heels,</HI> betook themselves to their <HI>Heels;</HI> and our Folks got safe into ano∣ther Garrison. On the <HI>Lords Day</HI> Morning, there was for a while, a Deep Silence among the As∣sailants; but at length getting into a Body, they marched with great Formality towards the <HI>Gar∣rison,</HI> where the Captain ordered his Handful of men to ly Snug, and not make a <HI>Shot,</HI> until every <HI>Shot</HI> might be likely to do some Execution. While they thus beheld a Formidable Crue of <HI>Dragons,</HI> coming with open mouth upon them, to Swallow them up at a Mouthful, one of the Souldiers began to speak of <HI>Surrendring;</HI> upon which the Captain Vehemently protested, <HI>That he would lay the man Dead, who should so much as mutter that base word any more!</HI> and so they heard no more on't: But the Valiant <HI>Storer</HI> was put upon the like protestation, to keep 'em in good
<PB N="94" REF="48"/> Fighting trim, aboard the <HI>Sloops</HI> also. The E∣nemy now Approaching very near, gave Three Shouts, that made the Earth ring again; and Crying out, in English, <HI>Fire, and Fall on, Brave Boyes!</HI> the whole Body, drawn into Three Ranks, Fired at once. Captain <HI>Convers</HI> immediately ran into the several Flankers, and made their Best Guns Fire at such a rate, that several of the E∣nemy fell, and the rest of 'em disappeared almost as Nimbly, as if they had been so many <HI>Spectres.</HI> Particularly, a parcel of them got into a small Deserted House; which having but a Board-Wall to it, the Captain sent in after them, those <HI>Bullets</HI> of Twelve to the Pound, that made the House too hot, for them that could get out of it. The <HI>Women</HI> in the Garrison, on this occasion took up the <HI>Amazonian</HI> Stroke, and not only brought Ammunition to the <HI>Men,</HI> but also with a <HI>Manly</HI> Resolution fired several Times upon the Enemy. The Enemy finding that Things would not yet go to their minds, at the <HI>Garrison,</HI> drew off, to Try their Skill upon the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which lay still abrest in the Creek, lash'd fast one to another. They built a Great <HI>Fire Work,</HI> about Eighteen or Twenty Foot Square, and fill'd it up with Com∣bustible matter, which they Fired; and then they set it in the way, for the <HI>Tide</HI> now to Flote it up, unto the <HI>Sloops,</HI> which had now nothing but an horrible <HI>Death</HI> before them. Neverthe∣less, their Demands, of both the <HI>Garrison,</HI> and
<PB N="95" REF="48"/> the <HI>Sloops,</HI> to yield themselves, were answered no otherwise than with <HI>Death</HI> upon many of them, Spit from the Guns of the Beseiged. Having tow'd their <HI>Fire-Work,</HI> as far as they durst, they committed it unto the <HI>Tide;</HI> but the Distres∣sed Christians that had this Deadly <HI>Fire,</HI> Swim∣ming along upon the <HI>Water</HI> towards 'em, com∣mitted it unto <HI>God:</HI> and <HI>God</HI> looked from Hea∣ven upon them, in this prodigious Article of their Distress. <HI>These poor men Cryed, and the Lord, heard them, and saved them out of their Troubles;</HI> The <HI>Wind,</HI> unto their Astonishment, immediately Turn'd about, and with a Fresh Gale drove the <HI>Machin</HI> ashore on the other side, and Split it so, that the <HI>Water</HI> being let in upon it, the <HI>Fire</HI> went out. So, the Godly men, that Saw God from Heaven thus Fighting for them, Cryed out, with an Astonishing Joy, <HI>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our Side, they had Swallowed us up quick; Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their Teeth; our Soul is Escaped, as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers!</HI> The Enemy were now in a pittiful pickle, with Toyling, and Moyling in the <HI>Mud,</HI> &amp; black'ned with it, if <HI>Mud</HI> could add <HI>Blackness</HI> to such Miscreants: and their Ammunition was pretty well Exhausted: So that now they began to Draw off, in all parts, and with Rafts get over the River; some whereof breaking, there did not a few <HI>Cool</HI> their late <HI>Heat</HI> by falling into it. But first, they made
<PB N="96" REF="49"/> all the Spoil they could, upon the <HI>Cattel</HI> about the Town; and giving one Shot more at the <HI>Sloops,</HI> they kill'd the only <HI>Man,</HI> of ours, that was kill'd aboard 'em. Then, after about Half an Hours Consultation, they send a <HI>Flag of Truce</HI> to the Garrison, advising 'em with much Flatte∣ry, to <HI>Surrender;</HI> but the Captain sent 'em word, <HI>That he wanted for nothing, but for men to come, and Fight him.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> replyed unto Captain <HI>Convers, Being you are so Stout, why don't you come, and Fight in the open Field, like a Man, and not Fight in a Garrison, like a Squaw?</HI> The Cap∣tain rejoyned; <HI>What a Fool, are you? Do you think, Thirty men a Match for Five Hundred? No,</HI> (sayes the Captain, counting as well he might, each of his <HI>Fifteen</HI> men, to be as Good as <HI>Two!) Come with your Thirty men upon the Plain, and I'le meet you with my Thirty, as soon as you will.</HI> Upon this, the <HI>Indian</HI> answered; <HI>Nay, mee own, English Fashi∣on is all one Fool; you kill mee, mee kill you! No, better ly some where, and Shoot a man, and hee no see! That the best Souldier!</HI> Then they fell to Coaksing the Captain, with as many <HI>Fine Words,</HI> as the <HI>Fox</HI> in the Fable had for the Allurement of his Prey unto him; and urged mightily that Ensign <HI>Hill,</HI> who stood with the <HI>Flag of Truce,</HI> might stand a little nearer their Army. The Captain, for a Good Reason, to be presently dis∣cerned, would not allow <HI>That:</HI> whereupon they fell to Threatning, and Raging, like so many
<PB N="97" REF="49"/> Defeated Devils, using these Words, <HI>Damn ye, we'll cut you as small as Tobacco, before to morrow Morning.</HI> The Captain, bid 'em to make Hast, for, <HI>he wanted work;</HI> So, the Indian throwing his Flag on the Ground, ran away, and Ensign <HI>Hill</HI> nimbly Stripping his Flag ran into the <HI>Valley,</HI> but the Salvages presently Fired, from an Ambush∣ment behind an <HI>Hill,</HI> near the place, where they had urged for a <HI>Parley.</HI></P>
<P>And now for poor <HI>John Diamond!</HI> The Ene∣my Retreating (which opportunity the <HI>Sloops</HI> took, to Burn down the Dangerous <HI>Hay-Stock,</HI>) into the plain, out of Gun-shot, they fell to Tor∣turing their Captive <HI>John Diamond,</HI> after a man∣ner very Diabolical. They <HI>Stripped</HI> him, they <HI>Scalped</HI> him alive, and after a <HI>Castration,</HI> they Finished that Article in the Punishment of <HI>Trai∣tors</HI> upon him; They Slit him with <HI>Knives,</HI> be∣tween his <HI>Fingers</HI> and his <HI>Toes;</HI> They made cruel <HI>Gashes</HI> in the most Fleshy parts of his Body, and stuck the Gashes with <HI>Fire-brands,</HI> which were afterwards found Sticking in the wounds. Thus they Butchered <HI>One</HI> poor Englishman, with all the <HI>Fury</HI> that they would have spent upon them <HI>all;</HI> and performed an Exploit, for Five Hun∣dred <HI>Furies</HI> to brag of, at their coming home. Ghastly to <HI>Express!</HI> what was it then to <HI>Suffer?</HI> They Returned then unto the <HI>Garrison,</HI> and kept Firing at it now and then, till near Ten a Clock at Night; when they all marched off, leaving
<PB N="98" REF="50"/> behind 'em some of their Dead; whereof one was Monsieur <HI>Labocree,</HI> who had about his <HI>Neck,</HI> a Pouch with about a Dozen <HI>Reliques</HI> ingeniously made up, and a Printed Paper of <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and several other Implements: but it seems, none of the <HI>Amulets</HI> about his <HI>Neck,</HI> would save him from a <HI>Mortal Shot</HI> in the <HI>Head.</HI> Thus in Forty Eight Hours, was Finished an Action as Worthy to be Related, as perhaps any that occurs in our Story. And it was not long before the Va∣liant <HI>Gouge,</HI> who bore his part in this Action, did another that was not much inferiour to it, when he suddenly Recovered from the French a valuable prey, which they had newly taken upon our Coast.</P>
<P>I doubt, Reader we have made this <HI>Article</HI> of our History a little too long. We will finish it, when we have Remark'd, That albeit there were too much <HI>Feebleness</HI> discovered by my Countrey∣men, in some of their Actions, during this War, at <HI>Sea,</HI> as well as on <HI>Shore,</HI> yet several of their Actions, especially at <HI>Sea,</HI> deserve to be Re∣membred. And I cannot but particularly be∣speak a Remembrance, for the Exploit perform∣ed by some of my Neighbours, in a Vessel going into <HI>Barbadoes</HI> They were in sight of <HI>Bar∣badoes</HI> assaulted by a <HI>French Vessel,</HI> which had a good number of Guns, and between <HI>Sixty</HI> and <HI>Seventy</HI> Hands.

<PB N="99" REF="50"/> two Tawny Servants. The Names of these <HI>Men,</HI> were <HI>Barret, Sunderland, Knoles, Nash, Morgan, Fosdyke,</HI> and Two more, that I now forget.

<HEAD>ARTICLE. XVII. <HI>The Fort at</HI> Pemmaquid.</HEAD>
<P>HIs Excellency Sir <HI>William Phipps,</HI> being ar∣rived now the Governour of <HI>New Eng∣land,</HI> applyed himself, with all possible Vigour, to carry on the <HI>War:</HI> and the Advice of a New
<PB N="100" REF="51"/> Slaughter some time in <HI>July</HI> made by the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> on certain poor Husband-men, in their Mea∣dows, at the North Side of <HI>Merrimack</HI> River, put an Accent upon the Zeal of the Designs, which he was now vigorously prosecuting. He Raised about Four hundred and Fifty Men, and in pursuance of his Instructions from <HI>White∣hall,</HI> he laid the Foundations of a Fort at <HI>Pem∣maquid,</HI> which was the Finest Thing that had been seen in these parts of <HI>America.</HI> Captain <HI>Wing,</HI> assisted with Captain <HI>Bancroft,</HI> went thro' the former part of the Work; and the latter part of it was Finished by Captain <HI>March.</HI> His Ex∣cellency, attended in this matter, with these worthy Captains, did, in a few Months, dis∣patch a Service for the King, with a <HI>Prudence,</HI> &amp; <HI>Industry,</HI> and <HI>Thirftiness,</HI> Greater than any <HI>Reward,</HI> they ever had for it. The Fort, called, The <HI>William Henry,</HI> was built of Stone, in a <HI>Quadran∣gular</HI> Figure; being about <HI>Seven hundred and thirty seven</HI> Foot in Compass, without the <HI>Outer Walls,</HI> and an <HI>Hundred and Eight</HI> Foot Square, within the <HI>Inner</HI> ones. <HI>Twenty Eight</HI> Ports it had; and <HI>Fourteen</HI> (if not <HI>Eighteen</HI>) Guns mounted, whereof Six were <HI>Eighteen-Pounders.</HI> The Wall, on the South Line, fronting to the Sea, was <HI>Twenty Two</HI> Foot <HI>High,</HI> and more than <HI>Six</HI> Foot <HI>Thick</HI> at the Ports, which were <HI>Eight</HI> Foot from the Ground. The Great Flanker, or Round Tower, at the <HI>Western</HI> End of this Line, was
<PB N="101" REF="51"/> <HI>Twenty Nine Foot</HI> High. The <HI>Wall</HI> on the <HI>East</HI> line, was <HI>Twelve</HI> Foot High, on the <HI>North</HI> it was <HI>Ten,</HI> on the <HI>West</HI> it was <HI>Eighteen.</HI> It was Computed, That in the whole, there were laid above <HI>Two Thousand Cart-Loads</HI> of Stone. It stood about a Score of Rods from <HI>High Water Mark;</HI> and it had generally at least <HI>Sixty men</HI> posted in it, for its Defence, which if they were <HI>Men,</HI> might easily have maintained it against more than <HI>Twice Six Hundred</HI> Assailants. Yea, we were almost Ready to flatter our selves, that we might have writ on the Gates of this Fort, as the French did over that of <HI>Namur,</HI> (yet after∣wards taken by K. <HI>William) Reddi, non Vinci po∣test.</HI> Now, as the Architect, that built the Strong Fortress at <HI>Narne</HI> in <HI>Poland</HI> had, for his Recom∣pence, his Eyes put out, lest he should build such another; Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> was almost as hard∣ly Recompenced, for the Building of This at <HI>Pemmaquid.</HI> Although this Fort thus Erected in the <HI>Heart</HI> of the Enemies Country, did so Break the <HI>Heart</HI> of the Enemy, that indeed they might have call'd it, as the French did theirs upon the River of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> The Fort of <HI>Crevecoeur;</HI> and the Tranquillity <HI>After</HI> Enjoy'd by the <HI>Country,</HI> (which was very much more than <HI>Before,</HI>) was, under God, much owing thereunto: yet the Ex∣pence of maintaining it, when we were so much impoverished otherwise, made it continually complained of, as one of the <HI>Countryes Grievances.</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="52"/> The Murmurings about this <HI>Fort,</HI> were so Epi∣demical, that, if we may speak in the Foolish cant of <HI>Astrology,</HI> and, Prognosticate from the Aspect of <HI>Saturn</HI> upon <HI>Mars,</HI> at its Nativity, <HI>Fort William-Henry, Thou hast not long to Live!

<PB N="103" REF="52"/> part of the English World, with a just Astonish∣ment: and I have met with some Strange Things, not here to be mentioned, which have made me often think, that this inexplicable <HI>War,</HI> might have some of its Original among the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> whose chief <HI>Sagamores</HI> are well known un∣to some of our Captives, to have been horrid <HI>Sorcerers,</HI> and hellish <HI>Conjurers,</HI> and such as Con∣versed with <HI>Daemons.</HI> The Sum of that Story is, Written in, <HI>The Life of Sir</HI> William Phipps; with such Irreproachable Truth, as to Defy the utmost Malice and Cunning of all our <HI>Sadducees,</HI> to Confute it, in so much as one Material Article: And that the Balant, and Latrant Noises of that sort of People, may be forever Silenced, the Story will be abundantly Justifyed, when the further Account written of it, by Mr. <HI>John Hale</HI> shall be published: For none can suspect a Gen∣tleman, so full of Dissatisfaction, at the proceed∣ings then used against the Supposed <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> as Now that Reverend Person is, to be a <HI>Super∣stitious Writer</HI> upon that Subject.</P>
<P>Now in the Time of that matchless <HI>War,</HI> there fell out a Thing at <HI>Glocester,</HI> which falls in here most properly to be related: a Town so Scitua∣ted, Surrounded, and Neighboured, in the Coun∣ty of <HI>Essex,</HI> that no man in his Witts, will ima∣gine, that a Dozen <HI>French men</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> would come, and alarm the Inhabitants for Three weeks together, and Engage 'em in several Skirmishes,
<PB N="104" REF="53"/> while there were two Regiments Raised, and a Detachment of Threescore men sent unto their Succour, and not one man Hurt in all the Actions, &amp; all End unaccountably. And because the Relation will be Extraordinary, I will not be my self the Author of any one clause in it; but I will Transcribe the words of a Minister of the Gospel, who did me the Favour, with much critical Caution to Examine <HI>Witnesses,</HI> not long after the Thing happened, and then sent me the Following Account.</P>

<HEAD>A Faithful Account of many Wonderful and Sur∣prising Things, which happened in the <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Glocester,</HI> in the Year, <HI>1692.</HI></HEAD>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P><HI>EBenezer Bapson,</HI> about midsummer, in the Year, 1692. with the rest of his Fa∣mily, almost every Night heard a Noise, as if persons were going and runing about his House. But one Night being abroad late, at his Return home, he saw Two men come out of his Door, and run from the end of the House into the Corn. But those of the Family told him, there had been no person at all there; where upon he got his Gun, and went out in pursuit after them, and coming a little Distance from the House, he saw the Two men start up from behind a Log, and run into a little Swamp, saying to each other,
<PB N="105" REF="53"/> <HI>The man of the House is Come, now Else we might have taken the House.</HI> So, he heard, nor saw, no more of them.</P>
<P>Upon this, the whole Family got up, and went with all speed, to a Garrison near by; and being just got into the Garrison, they heard men Stamping round the Garrison. Whereupon <HI>Bapson</HI> took his Gun, and ran out, and saw Two men again Runing down an Hill into a Swamp. The next Night but one, the said <HI>Bapson</HI> going toward a fresh Meadow, saw Two men, which looked like <HI>French men,</HI> one of them having a Bright Gun upon his Back, and both runing a great pace towards him, which caused him to make the best of his way to the Garrison, where being come several heard a Noise, as if men were Stamping and Running, not far from the Garrison. With∣in a Night or two after this, the persons in the Garrison, heard a Noise, as if men were throwing Stones against the Barn. Not long after this, <HI>Bapson,</HI> with <HI>John Brown,</HI> saw Three men, about a Gunshot off the Garrison, which they endeavoured to Shoot at, but were disap∣pointed by their Running to and fro, from the Corn into the Bushes. They were seen Two or Three Nights together; but though the a∣bovesaid strove to shoot at them, they could never attain it. On <HI>July.</HI> 14. <HI>Bapson,</HI> and <HI>Brown,</HI> with the rest of the men in the Gar∣rison,
<PB N="106" REF="54"/> saw within Gun-shot, half a dozen men; whereupon all the men, but one, made Hast out of the Garrison, marching towards them. <HI>Bapson</HI> presently overtook two of them, which run out of the Bushes, and coming close to them, he presented his Gun at them, and his Gun missing Fire, the Two men Returned into the Bushes. <HI>Bapson</HI> then called unto the other persons, which were on the other side of the Swamp, and upon his call, they made Answer, <HI>Here they are! Here they are! Bapson</HI> then run∣ning to meet them, Saw Three men walk sof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly out of the Swamp by each others Side; the middlemost having on a white Wast coat. So, being within Two or Three Rod of them, he Shot, and as soon as his <HI>Gun</HI> was off, they all fell down. <HI>Bapson</HI> then running to his suppo∣sed prey, cryed out unto his Companions, whom he heard on the other side of the Swamp, and said, <HI>He had kill'd Three! He had kill'd Three!</HI> But coming almost unto them, they all rose up, and one of them Shot at him, and hearing the Bullet whyss by him, he ran behind a Tree, and Loaded his Gun; and seeing them lye be∣hind a Log, he crept toward them again, tell∣ing his Companions, <HI>they were here!</HI> So, his Companions came up to him, and they all Ran directly to the Log, with all speed; but before they got thither, they saw them start up, and run every man his way; One of them run into the Corn, whom they pursued, and
<PB N="107" REF="54"/> hemm'd in; and <HI>Bapson</HI> seeing him coming to∣ward himself, Shot at him, as he was getting over the Fence, and saw him fall off the Fence on the Ground, but when he came to the Spot, he could not find him. So they all searched the Corn; and as they were searching; they heard a great Discoursing in the Swamp, but could not understand what they said; for they spoke in an <HI>unknown Tongue.</HI> Afterwards, looking out from the Garrison, they saw seve∣ral men Skulking among the <HI>Corn,</HI> and <HI>Bushes,</HI> but could not have a Shot at them.</P>
<P>The next morning, just at Day break, they saw one man come out of the Swamp, not far from the Garrison, and stand close up against the Fence, within Gun shot. Whereupon <HI>Isaac Prince,</HI> with a long Gun, shot at him with <HI>Swan∣shot,</HI> and in a moment he was gone out of sight, they saw him no more. Upon this, <HI>Bapson</HI> went, to carry News to the Harbour; and being about Half a mile in his way thither, he heard a Gun go off, and heard a Bullet whyss close by his Ear, which Cut off a Pine bush just by him, and the Bullet lodg'd in an Hemlock Tree. Then looking about, he saw Four men Running towards him, one with a Gun in his Hand, and the other with Guns on their Shoul∣ders. So he ran into the Bushes, and turning about, shot at them, and then ran away, &amp; saw them no more. About Six men returned
<PB N="108" REF="55"/> from the Harbour with him, searching the woods as they went; and they saw, where the <HI>Bullet</HI> had cut off the Pine bush, and where it was lodg'd in the Hemlock Tree, and they took the Bullet out, which is still to be seen. When they were come to the Garrison, they went to look for the Tracks of the Strange men, that had been seen, and saw several Tracks; and whilst they were looking on them, they saw one, which look'd like an <HI>Indian,</HI> having on a Blue coat, and his Hair Ty'd up behind, Stand∣ing by a Tree, and looking on them. But as soon as they spake to each other, he ran into a Swamp, and they after him, and one of them shot at him; but to no purpose. One of them also saw another, which look'd like a <HI>French man,</HI> but they quickly lost the sight of him.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 15. <HI>Ezekiel Day,</HI> being in Company with several others, who were ordered to Scout the woods, when they came to a certain Fresh Meadow, two miles from any House, at some Distance from the said Meadow, he saw a man, which he apprehended to be an <HI>Indian,</HI> cloath∣ed in Blue; and as soon as he saw him start up and run away, he shot at him; whereupon he saw another rise up a little way off, who al∣so run with speed; which together with the former, were quickly out of sight; and though himself, together with his Companions, diligent∣ly
<PB N="109" REF="55"/> sought after them, they could not find them. The same Day, <HI>John Hammond,</HI> with several other persons, Scouting in the woods, saw ano∣ther of these <HI>Strange men,</HI> having on a blue Shirt, and white Breeches, and something about his Head; but could not overtake him.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 17. Three or Four of these <HI>Unaccounta∣ble Troublers,</HI> came near the Garrison; but they could not get a shot at them. <HI>Richard Dolliver,</HI> also, &amp; <HI>Benjamin Ellary,</HI> creeping down an Hill, upon Discovery, saw several men come out of an Orchard, walking backward and forward, and stricking with a stick upon <HI>John Row's</HI> Deserted House, (the Noise of which, was heard by others at a Considerable Distance;) <HI>Ellery</HI> counting them, to be Eleven in all; <HI>Dol∣liver</HI> Shot at the midst of them, where they stood Thickest, and immediately they dispersed themselves, and were quickly gone out of sight.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 18. Which was the Time, that Major <HI>Appleton</HI> sent about Sixty men, from <HI>Ipswich,</HI> for the Towns Assistance, under these <HI>inexplicable Alarms,</HI> which they had suffered Night &amp; Day, for about a Fortnight together; <HI>John Day</HI> testi∣fies, that he went in Company with <HI>Ipswich</HI> and <HI>Glocester</HI> Forces, to a Garrison, about Two miles and an Half, from the Town; and News being brought in, that Guns went off, in a Swamp not far from the Garrison, some of the men, with himself, ran to discover what they
<PB N="110" REF="56"/> could; and when he came to the Head of the Swamp, he saw a man with a Blue Shirt, and bushy black Hair, run out of the Swamp, and into the Woods; he ran after him, with all speed, and came several Times within shot of him; but the woods being Thick, he could not obtain his Design of Shooting him; at length, he was at once gone out of sight, and when afterwards, he went to look for his Track, he could find none, though it were a low miry place, that he ran over.</P>
<P>About <HI>July</HI> 25. <HI>Bapson</HI> went into the Woods, after his Cattel, and saw Three men stand up∣on a point of Rocks, which look'd toward the Sea. So he crept among the Bushes, till he came within Forty yards of them; and then presented his <HI>Gun</HI> at them, and Snap't, but his Gun miss'd Fire; and so it did above a Dozen Times, till they all Three came up towards him, walking a slow pace, one of them having a Gun upon his Back. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did they take any more Notice of him, than just to give him a <HI>Look;</HI> though he snap'd his Gun at them, all the while they walked toward him, and by him; neither did they quicken their pace at all, but went into a parcel of Bushes, and he saw them no more. When he came home, he snap'd his Gun several Times, sometimes with but a few Corns of Powder and yet it did not once miss Fire. After this, there occurred several
<PB N="111" REF="56"/> Strange Things; but now concluding they were but <HI>Spectres,</HI> they took little further No∣tice of them.</P></Q>

<P>NOW, Reader, albeit that passage of the Sa∣cred Story, 2 Chron. 20.22. <HI>The Lord set Ambushments against the Children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, and they were Smitten:</HI> is by the best Expositors thus understood; That there was the Ministry of the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> wondrously Em∣ploy'd in this matter; the <HI>Angels</HI> in the Shape of <HI>Moabites</HI> and <HI>Ammonites,</HI> fell upon them of Mount <HI>Seir,</HI> and upon this apprehended provo∣cation they then all fell upon one another, until the whole Army was destroyed: Nevertheless, I entirely refer it unto thy Judgment (without the least offer of my own,) whether, <HI>Satan</HI> did not now <HI>Set Ambushments</HI> against the Good Peo∣ple of <HI>Glocester,</HI> with <HI>Daemons,</HI> in the Shape of Armed <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French-men</HI> appearing to con∣siderable Numbers of the Inhabitants, and mutu∣ally Firing upon them, for the best part of a Month together.

<P>IN the year, 1693. His Excellency sent away Captain <HI>Convers,</HI> to draw off the fittest of the Officers and Souldiers, quartered in the East, for a March, and causing about Three Hundred and Fifty more to be Levied, gave him, what he had merited above a year ago; even a Com∣mission of <HI>Major</HI> and Commander in Chief over these Forces. While Major <HI>Convers</HI> was at <HI>Wells,</HI> hearing of some Indians, that were seen in the Woods, he Surprised them all, and finding that they had cut off a poor Family at <HI>Oyster River,</HI> he gave the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief of them, something of what <HI>they</HI> also had merited. Going to <HI>Pemmaquid;</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="58"/> after some service there, they Sailed up <HI>Sheep∣scote</HI> River, &amp; then marched through the Woods to <HI>Taconet,</HI> which being Deserted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they ranged through many other Woods; but could meet with none of their Enemies.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE. XX.</HI> Bloody Fishing at <HI>Oyster</HI>-River. And Sad work at <HI>Groton.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Years Breathing Time,</HI> was a great Favour of Heaven to a Country, quite out of <HI>Breath,</HI> with Numberless Calamities: But the Fa∣vour was not so Thankfully Enjoyed, as it should have been. And now, <HI>The Clouds Return after the Rain.</HI> The <HI>Spectre</HI> that with Burning Tongs drove <HI>Xerxes</HI> to his War upon the <HI>Graecians,</HI> had not lost his Influence upon our <HI>Indians.</HI> The Perfidy of the <HI>Indians</HI> appeared first, in their not Restoring the <HI>English Captives,</HI> according to their <HI>Covenant;</HI> but the perfidious Wretches Excused this, with many Protestations. That which add∣ed unto our <HI>Jealousies</HI> about them, was, their In∣solent carriage towards a <HI>Sloop,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Wing;</HI> and the Information of a Fellow called <HI>Hector,</HI> That the <HI>Indians</HI> intended most certainly to break the <HI>Peace,</HI> and had promised
<PB N="121" REF="61"/> the <HI>French Priests,</HI> taking the <HI>Sacrament</HI> there∣upon, to destroy the first <HI>English Town</HI> they could Surprize. Rumours of <HI>Indians</HI> Lurking about some of the Frontier-Plantations, now be∣gan to put the poor people into <HI>Consternation;</HI> but upon an Imagination, that they were only cer∣tain <HI>Bever Hunters</HI> the Consternation of the people went off into <HI>Security.</HI> 'Tis affirmed by English Captives, which were then at <HI>Canada,</HI> that the Desolation of <HI>Oyster-River</HI> was com∣monly talk'd in the Streets of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> Two months before it was Effected; for the Spies had found no Town so Secure as <HI>That.</HI> And now, what was <HI>Talk'd</HI> at <HI>Quebeck</HI> in the month of <HI>May,</HI> must be <HI>Done</HI> at <HI>Oyster River</HI> in the month of <HI>July;</HI> for on Wednesday, <HI>July</HI> 18 1694. the Treachearous Enemy, with a great Army fell upon that place, about break of Day, and Killed and Captiv'd, Ninety Four, (or, an Hundred) persons; about a Score of whom, were men belonging to the Trained Band, of the Town. Several persons Remarkably Escaped this Bloody Deluge, but none, with more Bravery, than one <HI>Thomas Bickford,</HI> who had an House, a Little Pallisado'd, by the River Side; but no man in it besides himself. He dexterously put his Wife, and Mother, and Children aboard a Canoo, and Sending them down the River, he <HI>Alone,</HI> be∣took himself to the Defence of his House, against many Indians, that made an Assault upon him.
<PB N="122" REF="62"/> They first would have perswaded him, with many fair <HI>Promises,</HI> and then, terrified him with as many Fierce <HI>Threatnings,</HI> to yield himself; but he flouted and fired at them, daring 'em, to come if they durst. His main <HI>Stratagem</HI> was, to Change his <HI>Livery</HI> as frequently as he could; appearing Sometimes in one <HI>Coat,</HI> Sometimes in another, Sometimes in an <HI>Hat,</HI> and Sometimes in a <HI>Cap;</HI> which caused his Beseigers, to mistake this <HI>One</HI> for <HI>Many</HI> Defendents. In fine, The pittiful Wretches, despairing to <HI>Beat</HI> him out of his House, e'en left him in it; whereas many that opened unto them, upon their Solemn En∣gagements of giving them Life and Good Quar∣ter, were barborously butchered by them; and the Wife of one <HI>Adams,</HI> then with Child, was with horrible Barbarity Ripped up. And thus there was an End of the <HI>Peace,</HI> made at <HI>Pemma∣quid!</HI> Upon this, the Friends of Mrs <HI>Ursula Cutt,</HI> (Widow of Mr <HI>John Cutt,</HI> formerly President of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI>) desired her, to leave her Farm, which was about a Mile above the Bank Exposed unto the Enemy, on the South side of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> River. She Thank'd them for their <HI>Care,</HI> but added, that she believed, the Enemy had now done their Do for this Time; and however, by the <HI>End of the Week,</HI> her <HI>Business at the Farm</HI> would be all <HI>dispatched,</HI> and on <HI>Saturday,</HI> she would Repair to her Friends at the Bank. But, alas, before the <HI>End of the week,</HI> she saw the
<PB N="123" REF="62"/> <HI>End of her Life:</HI> On <HI>Saturday,</HI> about one or two a Clock, in the Afternoon, the <HI>Business at the Farm</HI> was <HI>Dispatched,</HI> sure enough! The Indians Then Kill'd this Gentlewoman, and Three other People, a little before they had Finished a point of Husbandry, then in their Hand. Nor did the Storm go over so: Some Drops of it fell upon the Town of <HI>Groton,</HI> a Town that lay, one would think, far enough off, the place, where was the last <HI>Scene</HI> of the <HI>Tragedy.</HI> On <HI>July</HI> 27. About break of Day, <HI>Groton</HI> felt, some Surprizing Blows, from the <HI>Indian Hatchets.</HI> They began their At∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ques, at the House of one Lieutenant <HI>Lakin,</HI> in the out skirts of the Town: but met with a Repulse there, and lost one of their Crue. Ne∣vertheless, in other parts of that Plantation, (when the Good People had been so tired out, as to lay down their <HI>Military Watch,</HI>) there were more than Twenty persons killed, and more than a Dozen carried away. Mr. <HI>Gershom Hobart,</HI> the Minister of the place, with part of his Family, was Remarkably preserved, from falling into their Hands, when they made themselves the Masters of his House; though they Took Two of his Children, whereof the one was killed, and the other some Time after happily Rescued out of his Captivity.</P>
<P>I remember, The Jews, in their Book <HI>Taanith,</HI> tell us, <HI>The Elders Proclaimed a Fast in their Cities, on this Occasion, because the Wolves had Devoured
<PB N="124" REF="63"/> two Little Children beyond Jordan.</HI> Truly, The Elders of <HI>New-England,</HI> were not a little concern∣ed at it, when they saw the <HI>Wolves</HI> thus devour∣ing their Children, even on this side of <HI>Merrimack!</HI></P>

<P><HI>REader,</HI> We must after This, ever Now and Then, Expect, the happening of some un∣happy Accident. The <HI>Blood-thirsty</HI> Salvages, not content with quaffing the <HI>Blood</HI> of Two or Three persons, found at work, in a Field at <HI>Spruce creek,</HI> on <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. &amp; of another person at <HI>York,</HI> the same Day, (Captivating also a Lad, which they found with him;) They did on <HI>Aug.</HI> 24. Kill &amp; Take, Eight persons at <HI>Kittery.</HI> Here, a little Girl, a∣bout Seven years old, the Daughter of one Mr. <HI>Downing,</HI> fell into their Barbarous Hands; They knock'd her o' th' Head, and barbarously Scalped her, leaving her on the <HI>Cold Ground,</HI> (and it was then very <HI>Cold,</HI> beyond what use to be,) where she lay all the Night Ensuing: Yet she was found <HI>Alive</HI> the Next Morning, and Recovering, she is to this Day <HI>Alive,</HI> and well: only the place broke in her skull, will not endure to be closed up. He had another Daughter, which at the same Time, almost miraculously Escaped their Hands. But so could not at another Time, <HI>Joseph Pike,</HI> of
<PB N="125" REF="63"/> <HI>Newbury,</HI> the <HI>Deputy Sheriff</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> who, on <HI>Sept.</HI> 4.

When he was going to <HI>Pemma∣quid,</HI> he left his Company, with a Strange Re∣luctancy and Formality, as if he had presaged the Event; and when at <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> he found the Event of his coming, he discovered a more than ordinary Disturbance of mind: his <HI>Passions</HI> foam'd and boyl'd, like the very <HI>Waters</HI> at the Fall of <HI>Niagara.</HI></P>
<P>But being thus fallen upon the mention of that <HI>Vengeance,</HI> wherewith Heaven pursued the chief
<PB N="126" REF="64"/> of the <HI>Salvage Murderers,</HI> it may give some Di∣version unto the Reader, in the midst of a long and a sad Story, to insert a Relation of an Acci∣dent that fell out a little after this Time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> (as the Captives inform us) be∣ing <HI>hungry and hardly bestead,</HI> passed through de∣serted <HI>Casco;</HI> where they spied several <HI>Horses</HI> in Captain <HI>Brackets</HI> Orchard. Their famished <HI>Squa's</HI> beg'd them to Shoot the <HI>Horses,</HI> that they might be revived with a little <HI>Roast meat;</HI> but the young men, were for having a little Sport before their Supper. Driving the <HI>Horses</HI> into a Pound, they took one of them, and furnished him with an <HI>Halter,</HI> suddenly made of the <HI>Main</HI> and the <HI>Tail</HI> of the Animal, which they cut off. A Son of the famous <HI>Hegon,</HI> was ambitious to mount this <HI>Pegasaean Steed;</HI> but being a pittiful Horseman, he ordered them, for fear of his Fall∣ing, to Ty his Legs fast under the <HI>Horses</HI> Belly. No sooner was this <HI>Beggar Set on Horse back,</HI> and the Spark in his own opinion throughly Equipt, but the Mettlesome <HI>Horse</HI> furiously and presently ran with him out of Sight. Neither <HI>Horse</HI> nor <HI>Man,</HI> were ever seen any more; the astonish'd Tawnies howl'd after one of their Nobility, disap∣pearing by such an unexpected Accident. A few Dayes after they found one of his <HI>Legs,</HI> (and that was <HI>All,</HI>) which they buried in Captain <HI>Brackets</HI> Cellar, with abundance of Lamentation.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE. XXII. <HI>A Conference with an</HI> Indian-Sagamore.</HEAD>
<P>BUt now <HI>Bommaseen</HI> is fallen into our Hands, let us have a little Discourse with him.</P>
<P>Behold, Reader, the Troubles, and the Trou∣blers of <HI>New-England!</HI> That thou mayst a little more Exactly Behold the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the matter, I'l Recite certain passages, occurring in a Discourse that pass'd between this <HI>Bommaseen</HI> (who was one of the <HI>Indian Princes,</HI> or, <HI>Chieftanes,</HI>) and a Minister of the Gospel, in the year. 1696.</P>
<P><HI>Bommaseen,</HI> was, with some other Indians, now a Prisoner, in <HI>Boston.</HI> He desired a Confe∣rence with a Minister, of <HI>Boston,</HI> which was granted him. <HI>Bommaseen,</HI> with the other <HI>Indians</HI> assenting and asserting to it, then told the Minister, That he pray'd his In∣struction in the <HI>Christian Religion;</HI> inasmuch as he was afraid, that the <HI>French,</HI> in the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion,</HI> which they taught the <HI>Indians,</HI> had Abused them. The Minister Enquired of him, What of the Things taught 'em by the <HI>French,</HI> appear'd most Suspicious to 'em? He said, The <HI>French</HI> taught 'em, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST, was of the <HI>French Nation;</HI> That His Mother, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was a <HI>French Lady;</HI> That they were the <HI>English</HI> who had Murdered him; and,
<PB N="128" REF="65"/> That whereas He Rose from the Dead, &amp; went up to the Heavens, all that would Recommend themselves unto His Favour, must Revenge His Quarrel upon the <HI>English,</HI> as far as they can. He ask'd the Minister, whether these Things were so; and pray'd the Minister to Instruct him in the True <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> The Mini∣ster considering, that the Humour and Manner of the <HI>Indians,</HI> was to have their Discourses ma∣naged, with much of <HI>Similitude</HI> in them, Look'd about for some Agreeable object, from whence he might with apt <HI>Resemblances</HI> Convey the <HI>Idae's</HI> of Truth unto the minds of Salvages: and he thought, none would be more Agreeable to <HI>them,</HI> than a <HI>Tankard of Drink,</HI> which happened then to be standing on the Table. So he pro∣ceeded in this <HI>Method</HI> with 'em.</P>
<P>He told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, [still with proper Actions painting, and pointing out the <HI>Signs</HI> unto them,] That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, had given us, a <HI>Good Religion,</HI> which might be Resembled unto the <HI>Good Drink in the Cup,</HI> upon the Table.</P>
<P>That if we Take this <HI>Good Religion,</HI> (even that <HI>Good Drink,</HI>) into our Hearts, it will do us <HI>Good,</HI> and preserve us from <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>That Gods <HI>Book,</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> is the <HI>Cup,</HI> wherein that <HI>Good Drink,</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> is offered unto us.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French,</HI> having the <HI>Cup</HI> of <HI>Good Drink,</HI> in their Hands, had put <HI>Poison</HI> into it; and then made the <HI>Indians</HI> to Drink that <HI>Poisoned Liquor,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="65"/> whereupon, they Run mad, and fell to killing of the <HI>English,</HI> though they could not but know, it must unavoidably issue in their own Destruction at the Last.</P>
<P>That, it was plain, the <HI>English</HI> had put no <HI>Poi∣son,</HI> into the <HI>Good Drink;</HI> for they set the <HI>Cup</HI> wide open, and invited all men, to <HI>Come</HI> &amp; <HI>See</HI> before they <HI>Tast;</HI> even, the very <HI>Indians</HI> them∣selves; for we Translated the <HI>Bible</HI> into <HI>Indian.</HI> That they might gather from hence, that the <HI>French</HI> had put <HI>Poison</HI> into the <HI>Good Drink;</HI> inas∣much, as the <HI>French</HI> kept the <HI>Cup</HI> fast Shut, (the Bible in an <HI>Unknown Tongue,</HI>) and kept their <HI>Hands</HI> upon the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they put it unto their mouths.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> Expressing themselves to be well-Satisfied, with what the Minister had hitherto said, pray'd him, to go on, with showing 'em, what was the <HI>Good Drink,</HI> and what was the <HI>Poi∣son,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had put into it.</P>
<P>He then set before them distinctly the chief <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> with all the Sim∣plicity and Sincerity of a <HI>Protestant:</HI> Adding upon each, <HI>This is the Good Drink, in the Lords Cup of Life:</HI> And they still professed, <HI>That they liked it all.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, he demonstrated unto them, how the <HI>Papists</HI> had in their Idolatrous <HI>Popery,</HI> some way or other Depraved, and Altered, every one of these <HI>Articles;</HI> with Scandalous <HI>Ingredients</HI> of
<PB N="130" REF="66"/> their own Invention; Adding upon each, <HI>This is the Poison which the French have put into the Cup.</HI></P>
<P>At last, he mentioned this Article.</P>
<P><HI>To obtain the Pardon of your Sins, you must con∣fess your Sins to God; &amp; pray to God, That He would Pardon your Sins, for the sake of Jesus Christ, who dyed for the Sins of His People: God Loves Jesus Christ infinitely, and if you place your Eye on Jesus Christ only, when you beg the Pardon of your Sins, God will Pardon them. You need confess your Sins to none but God, Except in cases, where men have known your Sins, or have been Hurt by your Sins; &amp; then those men should know that you confess your Sins; but after all, none but God can Pardon them.</HI></P>
<P>He then added; <HI>The French have put Poison in∣to this Good Drink; They tell you, that you must confess your Sins to a Priest, and carry skins to a Priest, and Submit unto a Penance enjoyned by a Priest; and this Priest is to give you a Pardon. There is no need of all This: 'Tis nothing but French Poison, all of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Wretches appearing astonish'd, to meet with one who would so fairly put them into a glorious way to obtain the <HI>Pardon of their Sins,</HI> and yet take no <HI>Bever Skins</HI> for it: in a Rap∣ture of Astonishment, they fell down on their <HI>knees,</HI> and got his <HI>Hand</HI> into theirs, and fell to kissing of it with an Extream show of Affection.</P>
<P>He shaking them off, with dislike of their posture, <HI>Bommaseen</HI> with the rest of them stood
<PB N="131" REF="66"/> up; and first lifting up his Eyes, and Hands, to Heaven; declaring, That <HI>God</HI> should be <HI>Judge</HI> of his <HI>Heart</HI> in what he said; he then said, Sir, <HI>I thank you for these Things; I Resolve to Spit up all the French Poison; You shall be my Father; I will be your Son; I beseech you, to continue, to Instruct me, in that Religion, which may bring me to the Salvation of my Soul!</HI> — Now, God knows, what <HI>Heart</HI> this <HI>Indian</HI> had, when he so Expressed himself: To <HI>Him</HI> let us leave it.</P>
<P>But so much for this Digression.</P>

At length, upon the Mediation of old <HI>Sheepscoat John,</HI> once a <HI>Praying Indian,</HI> of the Reverend ELIOT's <HI>Ca∣techmuens,</HI> but after-wards, a <HI>Pagan,</HI> and now a <HI>Popish</HI>-Apostate, a Great Fleet of <HI>Canoo's</HI> came,
<PB N="132" REF="67"/> in to an Island, about a League from the Fort at <HI>Pemmaquid, May</HI> 20. 1695. and, after they had laid still there, all the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> on <HI>Munday</HI> morning they sent unto the English, for another Treaty. They Declared, Their Design was to <HI>Exchange Captives,</HI> and Renew the <HI>Peace,</HI> and con∣demned themselves for their Violating the <HI>Peace</HI> made near Two years ago. <HI>Eight Captives,</HI> they Immediately Delivered up; and upon a Grant of a <HI>Truce</HI> for Thirty Days, Colonel <HI>John Phillips,</HI> Lieut. Colonel <HI>Hawthorn,</HI> and Major <HI>Convers,</HI> were sent Commissioners unto <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> for the management of that affayr.

Advice was immediate∣ly dispatch'd into all parts of the <HI>Eastern Country,</HI> to stand well upon their Guard: notwithstand∣ing which, on <HI>July</HI> 6. Major <HI>Hammond</HI> of <HI>Kittery,</HI> fell into the Hands of the Lurking <HI>Indians;</HI> and the next week, Two men at <HI>Exeter</HI> were kill'd by some of the same Dangerous <HI>Lurkers.</HI> Ma∣jor <HI>Hammond</HI> was now aboard a <HI>Canoo,</HI> intending to put ashore at <HI>Saco;</HI> but some of the Garrison-Souldiers there, not knowing that they had such a good Friend aboard, inadvertently Fired upon
<PB N="133" REF="67"/> the <HI>Canoo;</HI> and so, the <HI>Indians</HI> carried him clear away. They transported him at length to <HI>Ca∣nada;</HI> where he met with Extraordinary Civi∣lities; Count <HI>Frontenack,</HI> the Governour himself, nobly purchased him, of his Tawny-master; and sent him home to <HI>New-England,</HI> by a Vessel, which also fetch'd from thence a Considerable Number, (perhaps near <HI>Thirty</HI>) of English Prisoners.

<PB N="136" REF="69"/> Scalpt for Dead, and no doubt the Salvages upon producing her <HI>Scalp,</HI> received the <HI>Price of her Death,</HI> from those that hired them, and yet she so Recovered, as to be still <HI>Alive.</HI> Moreover, on <HI>July</HI> 26. the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> the People at <HI>Quoche∣cho,</HI> returning from the Publick Worship of God, <HI>Three</HI> of them were killed, <HI>Three</HI> of them were wounded, and <HI>Three</HI> of them were carried away Prisoners to <HI>Penobscut;</HI> which last <HI>Three,</HI> were nevertheless in less than Three weeks returned. But now we are got into fatal <HI>August;</HI> on the Fifth or Sixth Day of which Month, the French having Taken one of the English <HI>Men of War,</HI> called, <HI>The New-port,</HI> and Landed a few men, who joyn'd with the Indians, to pursue their Business, <HI>Chub,</HI> with an unaccountable Baseness, did Surrender the Brave Fort at <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> into their Hands. There were Ninety Five men double Armed, in the Fort, which might have Defended it against Nine Times as many Assai∣lants; That a <HI>Fort</HI> now should be so basely given up! Imitating the Style of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> I cannot forbear crying out, <HI>O merae Novanglae, neque enim Novangli!</HI> And yet if you read the Story written by the Sieur <HI>Froger,</HI> how poorly St. <HI>James's</HI> Fort, in <HI>Africa,</HI> was given up to the French in the year, 1695.

<PB N="137" REF="69"/> grown mighty <HI>Uppish,</HI> Triumph'd, as well they might, Exceedingly; and Threatned, that they would carry all before them. The Honourable Lieutenant Governour <HI>Stoughton,</HI> who was now Commander in Chief, over the Province, im∣mediately did all that could be done, to put a Stop unto the Fury of the Adversary. By <HI>Sea,</HI> he sent out Three <HI>Men of War,</HI> who, disadvantag∣ed by the Winds, came not soon Enough to en∣gage the <HI>French.</HI> By <HI>Land,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> being so Posted in all quarters, that the People could hardly Stir out, but about half a Score of the poor People in their Fields here and there were pick't off, he sent Colonel <HI>Gidney</HI> with Five Hundred men; who perceiving the Salvages to be drawn off, only Strengthened the Garrisons, and Return∣ed. The Lieutenant Governour, that he might not in any other point be wanting, to the Pub∣lick Safety, hereupon dispatched, Colonel <HI>Naw∣thorn,</HI> with a Suitable Number of Souldiers, and Frigats unto St. <HI>Johns,</HI> with orders to fetch a∣way some Great Guns that were lying there, &amp; joyn with Major <HI>Church</HI> who was gone with Forces that way, to attack the Fort at St. <HI>Johns,</HI> which was the Nest of all the <HI>Wasps</HI> that Stung us: but the Difficulty of the <HI>Cold Season</HI> so dis∣couraged our men, that after the making of some few Shot, the Enterprize found it self un∣der too much <HI>Congelation</HI> to proceed any further.

<HEAD>ARTICLE. XXV. <HI>A Notable Exploit; wherein,</HI> Dux Faemina Facti.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>March</HI> 15. 1697. the Salvages made a Descent upon the Skirts of <HI>Haverhil,</HI> Mur∣dering and Captiving about Thirty Nine Per∣sons, and Burning about Half a Dozen Houses. In this Broil, one <HI>Hannah Dustan,</HI> having lain in about a Week, attended with her Nurse, <HI>Mary Neff,</HI> a Widow, a Body of Terrible <HI>Indians</HI> drew near unto the House, where she lay, with Designs to carry on their Bloody Devastations. Her Husband, hastened from his Employments a∣broad, unto the Relief of his Distressed Family; and first bidding <HI>Seven</HI> of his <HI>Eight</HI> Children (which were from <HI>Two</HI> to <HI>Seventeen</HI> years of Age)
<PB N="139" REF="70"/> to get away as fast as they could, unto some Garrison in the Town, he went in, to inform his Wife, of the horrible Distress come upon them, E're she could get up, the fierce <HI>Indians</HI> were got so near, that utterly despairing to do <HI>her</HI> any Service, he ran out after his Children; Resolving, that on the Horse, which he had with him, he would Ride away with <HI>That,</HI> which he should in this Extremity, find his Affections to pitch most upon, and leave the Rest, unto the care of the Divine Providence. He overtook his Children about Forty Rod from his Door; but <HI>then,</HI> such was the <HI>Agony</HI> of his Parental Af∣fections, that he found it impossible for him to Distinguish any one of them from the rest; wherefore he took up a Courageous Resolution to Live and Dy with them all. A party of In∣dians came up with him; and now, though they Fired at him, and he Fired at them, yet he man∣fully kept at the Reer of his <HI>Little Army</HI> of Un∣armed Children, while they Marched off, with the pace of a Child of Five years old; until, by the Singular Providence of God, he arrived safe with them all, unto a place of Safety, about a Mile or two from his House. But his House must in the mean Time, have more dismal <HI>Tra∣gaedies</HI> acted at it. The <HI>Nurse</HI> trying to Escape, with the New-born <HI>Infant,</HI> fell into the Hands of the Formidable Salvages; and those furious Tawnies coming into the House, bid poor <HI>Dustan,</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="71"/> to Rise Immediately. Full of Astonishment, she did so; and sitting down in the Chimney, with an Heart full of most fearful <HI>Expectation,</HI> she saw the Raging Dragons riffle all that they could carry away, and set the House on Fire. About Nineteen or Twenty <HI>Indians,</HI> now led these a∣way, with about Half a Score other English <HI>Captives;</HI> but e're they had gone many Steps, they dash'd out the Brains of the <HI>Infant,</HI> against a Tree; and several of the other <HI>Captives,</HI> as they began to Tire in their sad <HI>Journey,</HI> were soon sent unto their <HI>Long Home;</HI> the Salvages would presently bury their Hatchets in their Brains, and leave their Carcases on the Ground, for Birds and Beasts to feed upon. However, <HI>Dustan</HI> (with her Nurse) notwithstanding her present Condition, Travelled that Night, about a Dozen Miles; and then kept up with their New Masters, in a long Travel of an Hundred and Fifty Miles, more or less, within a few Days Ensuing, without any sensible Damage, in their Health, from the Hard-ships, of their <HI>Travel,</HI> their <HI>Lodging,</HI> their <HI>Diet,</HI> and their many other Difficulties. These Two poor Women, were now in the Hands of those, whose <HI>Tender Mer∣cies are Cruelties;</HI> but the Good God, who hath all <HI>Hearts in His own Hands,</HI> heard the Sighs of these <HI>Prisoners,</HI> and gave them to find unexpected Favour from the <HI>Master,</HI> who laid claim unto them. That <HI>Indian Family</HI> consisted of Twelve
<PB N="141" REF="71"/> Persons; Two Stout men, Three Women, and Seven Children; and for the Shame of many an <HI>English Family,</HI> that ha's the Character of, <HI>Prayerless,</HI> upon it, I must now Publish what these poor Women assure me: 'Tis <HI>This;</HI> In Obedience to the Instructions, which the French have given them, they would have <HI>Prayers</HI> in their Family, no less than Thrice Every Day: In the <HI>Morning,</HI> at <HI>Noon,</HI> and in the <HI>Evening;</HI> nor would they ordinarily let their Children <HI>Eat</HI> or <HI>Sleep,</HI> without first saying their <HI>Prayers.</HI> In∣deed these <HI>Idolaters,</HI> were like the rest of their whiter Brethren, <HI>Persecutors;</HI> and would not en∣dure, that these poor Women should Retire to their <HI>English Prayers,</HI> if they could hinder them. Nevertheless, the poor Women, had nothing but fervent <HI>Prayers,</HI> to make their Lives Comfortable, or Tolerable; and by being daily sent out, upon Business, they had Opportunities together and asunder, to do like another <HI>Hannah,</HI> in <HI>Pouring out their Souls before the Lord:</HI> Nor did their praying Friends among our selves, forbear to <HI>Pour out</HI> Supplications for them. Now, they could not observe it without some wonder, that their Indian Master, sometimes, when he saw them Dejected, would say unto them; <HI>What need you Trouble your self? If your God will have you delivered, you shall be so!</HI> And it seems, our God would have it so to be. This <HI>Indian Family,</HI> was now Travelling with these Two Cap∣tive
<PB N="142" REF="72"/> Women, (and an English youth, taken from <HI>Worcester,</HI> a year and half before,) unto a Ren∣dezvouz of Salvages, which they call, a <HI>Town,</HI> somewhere beyond <HI>Penacook;</HI> and they still told these poor Women, that when they came to this Town, they must be Stript, and Scourg'd, and run the <HI>Gantlet</HI> through the whole Army of <HI>Indians.</HI> They said, This was the <HI>Fashion,</HI> when the Captives first came to a Town; and they derided some of the Faint hearted English, which, they said, fainted and swooned away under the <HI>Torments</HI> of this Discipline. But on <HI>April.</HI> 30. While they were yet, it may be, a∣bout an Hundred and Fifty Miles from the In∣dian Town, a little before Break of Day, when the whole Crew was in a <HI>Dead Sleep;</HI> (Reader, see if it prove not So!) one of these Women, took up a Resolution, to Imitate the Action of <HI>Jael</HI> upon <HI>Sisera;</HI> and being where she had not her own <HI>Life</HI> secured by any <HI>Law</HI> unto her, she thought she was not Forbidden by any <HI>Law,</HI> to take away the <HI>Life</HI> of the <HI>Murderers,</HI> by whom her <HI>Child</HI> had been butchered. She heartened the <HI>Nurse,</HI> and the <HI>Youth,</HI> to assist her in this En∣terprize; and all furnishing themselves with <HI>Hat∣chets</HI> for the purpose, they struck such Home Blows, upon the Heads of their <HI>Sleeping Oppressors,</HI> that e're they could any of them Struggle into any Effectual Resistence, <HI>at the Feet</HI> of those poor Prisoners, <HI>they bowed, they fell, they lay down;
<PB N="143" REF="72"/> at their feet they bowed, they fell; where they bow∣ed, there they fell down Dead.</HI> Only one <HI>Squaw</HI> escaped sorely wounded from them, in the Dark, and one <HI>Boy,</HI> whom they Reserved Asleep, in∣tending to bring him away with them, suddenly wak'd, and skuttled away from this Desolation. But cutting off the <HI>Scalps</HI> of the <HI>Ten Wretches,</HI> they came off, and Received <HI>Fifty Pounds</HI> from the General Assembly of the Province, as a Re∣compence of their Action; besides which they Received many <HI>presents of Congratulation</HI> from their more private Friends, but none gave 'em a greater Tast of Bounty, than Colonel <HI>Nichol∣son,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Maryland,</HI> who hearing of their Action, sent 'em a very generous Token of his Favour.</P>

About the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> Major <HI>March</HI> was Employ'd, with a∣bout Five Hundred Souldiers, not only to De∣fend the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> but also to seek out, and Beat up, the Enemies Quarters. In the mean time, the Lieutenant Governour, apprehending an <HI>Invasion</HI> from a Formidable <HI>French Fleet</HI> on the Coast of <HI>New-England,</HI> with his accustomed prudence and vigour, applied himself to put the whole Province into a posture of Defence: And the <HI>Militia,</HI> with the several <HI>Forts,</HI> especi∣ally that of <HI>Boston,</HI> (very much through the Contrivance and Industry of Captain <HI>Fairwea∣ther,</HI>) were brought into so good a posture, that some could hardly forbear too much Depen∣dence on our Preparations.

Before the Major arrived at <HI>York,</HI> a party of the Enemy kill'd a man that stood Centinel for some of his Neighbours at Work
<PB N="146" REF="74"/> in the Marsh at <HI>Wells;</HI> and catching another <HI>A∣live,</HI> they carried him a mile and half off, and Roasted him to <HI>Death:</HI> But Captain <HI>Brackett,</HI> that followed him <HI>quite</HI> as far as <HI>Kennebunk,</HI> did but <HI>almost</HI> overtake them: For truly, Reader, our Souldiers cannot, as Antiquity Reports, the old <HI>Graecian,</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Souldiers could, march at a Running pace or tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, heavily Loaded, five and twenty miles in four Hours; but rather suspect whether those Reports of Anti∣quity be not Romantick.

Arriving at <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> they did, upon the Ninth of <HI>September,</HI> come as occult as they could, further East among the Islands, near a place called, <HI>Corbins Sounds;</HI> and Landed be∣fore Day, at a place called, <HI>Damascotta River:</HI> where, before Half of them were well got a∣shore, and drawn up, the scarce-yet-expected Enemy, Entertained them with a <HI>Volley,</HI> and an <HI>Huzza!</HI> None of ours were Hurt; but Major <HI>March,</HI> Repaid 'em in their own <HI>Lea∣den Coin;</HI> and it was no sooner Light, but a <HI>Considerable Battel</HI> Ensued.

Our Army thus beat 'em off, with the Loss of about a Dozen men: whereof One was, the worthy Captain <HI>Dym∣mock</HI> of <HI>Barnstable:</HI> and about as many Woun∣ded, whereof one was Captain <HI>Phillips</HI> of, <HI>Charlstown;</HI> and in this Action, Captain <HI>Whiting</HI><PB N="148" REF="75"/> a young Gentleman of much <HI>Worth,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> Courageously acting his part, as Commander of the <HI>Forces,</HI> the <HI>Helpers of the War,</HI> which the Co∣lony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> had Charitably lent unto this Expedition, had his Life remarkably rescued, from a Bullet grazing the Top of his Head.

<PB N="151" REF="76"/> much doubted, <HI>What Indians!</HI>) have in this War, made several Descents upon some of the upper Towns, that were our most <HI>Northerly Set∣tlements</HI> upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. But the Pious, and Honest People in those Towns, have al∣ways given them a brave Repulse, and had a no∣table Experience of the Divine Favour to them, in their preservations. <HI>Deerfield</HI> ha's been an Extraordinary Instance of Courage, in keeping their <HI>Station,</HI> though they have lived all this while in a very <HI>Pihahiroth;</HI> and their worthy Pastor, Mr. <HI>John Williams,</HI> deserves the Thanks of all this Province, for his Encouraging them all the ways Imaginable, to <HI>Stand</HI> their ground. Once the Enemy was like to have Surprised them into a grievous Desolation; but <HI>he,</HI> with his Praying, and Valiant, little Flock, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st hap∣pily Repelled them. And now, about the mid∣dle of <HI>July,</HI> 1698. a little before Sun set, <HI>Four Indians,</HI> killed a Man and a Boy, in <HI>Hatfield</HI> Meadows; and carried away Two Boys, into Captivity. The Advice coming to <HI>Deerfield</HI> in the Night, they presently Dispatched away Twelve men, to way lay the Enemy coming up the River; having first, Look'd up unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that they might find the <HI>Ene∣my,</HI> and harm none but the <HI>Enemy,</HI> and Rescue the Children which the <HI>Enemy</HI> had Seized upon. After a Travel of near Twenty Miles, they per∣ceived the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their <HI>Canooes</HI> coming up the
<PB N="152" REF="77"/> River, but on the other side of it, within a Rod or Two, of the opposite Shore: Whereupon they so <HI>Shot,</HI> as to <HI>Hitt</HI> one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and then they all Jump't out of the <HI>Canooes,</HI> and one of the Boyes with them. The <HI>wounded Salvage</HI> crawled unto the Shoar; where, his <HI>back</HI> being broken, he lay in great Angush, often Endea∣vouring with his Hatchet, for to knock out his own <HI>Brains,</HI> and tear open his own <HI>Breast,</HI> but could not: and another <HI>Indian</HI> seeing the Two Boyes getting one to another, design'd 'em a Shot, but his Gun would not go off: Where∣upon he followed 'em with his Hatchet, for to have knock'd 'em on the Head; but just as he come at 'em, one of our men sent a <HI>Shot</HI> into him, that Spoilt his Enterprize; and so the Boyes getting together, into one <HI>Canooe,</HI> brought it o∣ver to the Friends thus concerned for them. These good men, seeing their Exploit perform∣ed thus far; <HI>Two Indians</HI> destroy'd, and <HI>Two Children</HI> delivered, they fell to <HI>Praising of God;</HI> and one young man particularly, kept thus Ex∣pressing himself; <HI>Surely, Tis God, and not we, that have wrought this Deliverance!</HI> But, as we have sometimes been told. That even in the Beating of a <HI>Pulse,</HI> the Dilating of the Heart, by a <HI>Diastole</HI> of Delight, may be turned into a con∣tracting of it, with a <HI>Systole</HI> of Sorrow: In the Beating of a few <HI>Pulse,</HI> after this, they sent five or six men, with the <HI>Canooe,</HI> to fetch the other,
<PB N="153" REF="77"/> which was lodged at an Island not far off, that they might pursue the other <HI>Indians:</HI> when those two <HI>Indians</HI> having hid themselves in the High-grass, unhappily Shot a quick <HI>Death,</HI> into the young man, whose Expressions were but now recited. This Hopeful young mans Bro∣ther-in-Law, was intending to have gone out, upon this Action; but the young man himself importuned his Mother to let <HI>him</HI> go: which, because he was an <HI>only Son,</HI> she denyed; but then, fearing she did not well to <HI>withold her Son</HI> from the Service of the Publick, she gave him leave: saying, <HI>See that you do now, and as you go along, Resign, and give up your self unto the Lord; and I desire to Resign you to Him!</HI> So he goes, and so he dies; And may <HI>he</HI> be the <HI>last,</HI> that falls in a Long and Sad <HI>War,</HI> with <HI>Indian Salvages!</HI></P>

<P>Major <HI>Convers,</HI> and Captain <HI>Alden,</HI> in pursu∣ance of Instructions Received from the Lieut. Governour and Council, arriving at <HI>Penobscet,</HI> on <HI>Oct.</HI> 14. 1698. were there informed, That <HI>Ma∣dockawando,</HI> the noted Sagamore, with several o∣ther <HI>Sachims</HI> of the East, were lately Dead. And six days after this, the chief <HI>Sachims</HI> now Living, with a great Body of Indians, Entertain∣ed them with a Friendly Discourse; wherein they said, That the Earl of <HI>Frontenac</HI> had sent them word, there was a <HI>Peace</HI> concluded be∣tween the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and that one of the Articles in the <HI>Peace</HI> was, for Prisoners on both sides to be Returned, and they were Resolved to obey the Earl of <HI>Frontenac</HI> as their Father; and accordingly such Prisoners of ours, as they had now at hand, might immedi∣ately Return, if <HI>we</HI> could <HI>perswade</HI> them, for <HI>They</HI> would not <HI>Compel</HI> them. When our Eng∣lish Messengers argued with them, upon the <HI>perfidiousness</HI> of their making a <HI>New War,</HI> after their <HI>Submission,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> replied, That they were Instigated by the <HI>Erench</HI> to do what they did, against their own Inclinations; adding, That there were two <HI>Jesuites,</HI> one toward <HI>Amo∣noscoggin,</HI> the other at <HI>Narridgaway,</HI> both of which, they desired the Earl of <HI>Bellomont,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Frontenac,</HI> to procure to be Remov∣ed; otherwise it could not be expected, that a∣ny
<PB N="155" REF="78"/> <HI>Peace</HI> would continue long. The <HI>Indians</HI> al∣so, and the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, gave them to un∣derstand, that the last <HI>Winter,</HI> many, both <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, were Starved to Death; and particularly, <HI>Nine Indians,</HI> in one company went a Hunting, but met with such hard cir∣cumstances, that after they had Eat up their <HI>Dogs,</HI> and their <HI>Coats,</HI> they Dyed horribly Fa∣mished: And since the last Winter, a grievous and unknown <HI>Disease</HI> is got among them, which consumed them wonderfully. The Sagamore <HI>Saquadock,</HI> further told them, That the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians, would fain have gone to War again, this last Summer, but the other <HI>Refused,</HI> where∣upon they likewise <HI>Desisted:</HI> And they Resolved now, to <HI>Fight no more;</HI> but if any Ill Accident or Action, should happen on either side, he did in the Name of the Indians Desire, That we would not presently make a <HI>War</HI> upon it, but in a more amicable way compose the Differences.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indian</HI> Affayrs might come to be yet more exactly understood, the General As∣sembly of the Province, Employ'd Colonel <HI>John Phillips,</HI> and Major <HI>Convers,</HI> to Settle them. These Gentlemen, took a Difficult and a Dan¦gerous Voyage, in the Depth or Winter, unto the Eastern parts, in the Province-Galley, then under the Command of Captain <HI>Cyprian Southack;</HI> and the principal <HI>Sagamores</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> there coming to them, did again Renew, and Sub∣scribe

<P>They informed me, That Three Captives in one <HI>Wigwam,</HI> were Starved to Death last Win∣ter.</P>
<P><HI>Mary Fairbanks,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Hutching,</HI> and some other Captives, told me, That <HI>Jonathan Hutching,</HI> belonging to <HI>Spruce-Creek,</HI> a Lad fourteen years old; They met him crying for want of Victuals, for in Two or Three Dayes he had nothing to Eat. Afterward, as he was going to fetch some Wood, he felt something hard in his Bosome.

<P>Some other of the Captives told me, That one <HI>Mary Catter,</HI> (which person we now brought home with us, belonging to <HI>Kittery</HI>) her Master and many other Indians, came down to <HI>Casco-Bay.</HI> There seeing some Sloops, or Shallops, they thought they were the English coming upon them, and ran away, into the Woods, and left the said <HI>Mary Catter</HI> very Sick in the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> without any thing at all to Eat.

<P>The Reader now ha's nothing but <HI>Peace</HI> be∣fore him. Doubtless he comforts himself with Hopes, of <HI>Times</HI> better to <HI>Live</HI> in, than to <HI>Write</HI> of!</P>
<P>BUt that which yet more assures a <HI>Break of Day</HI> after a long and sad <HI>Night</HI> unto us, is, That the Best <HI>King</HI> at this Day upon Earth, and the <HI>Greatest Monarch,</HI> that ever Sway'd the Scep∣ter of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> hath Commission'd a Noble Person, who hath in him an Illustrious <HI>Image</HI> of His own <HI>Royal Vertues,</HI> to take the Government of these Provinces; and he is accordingly Ar∣rived now near our Horizon.

<HEAD>ARTICLE XXIX. <HI>Quakers Encountred.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOr the present then, we have done with the <HI>Indians:</HI> But while the <HI>Indians</HI> have been thus molesting us, we have suffered Molestati∣ons of another sort, from another sort of Ene∣mies, which may with very good Reason, be cast into the same <HI>History</HI> with them. If the <HI>Indians</HI> have chosen to prey upon the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> and <HI>Out-Skirts,</HI> of the Province, the <HI>Quakers</HI> have chosen the very same <HI>Frontiers,</HI> and, <HI>Out-Skirts,</HI> for their more <HI>Spiritual Assaults;</HI> and fin∣ding little <HI>Success</HI> elsewhere, they have been La∣bouring <HI>incessantly</HI> and sometimes not <HI>unsuccessful∣ly,</HI> to Enchant and Poison the <HI>Souls</HI> of poor peo∣ple, in the very places, where the <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>E∣states,</HI> of the people have presently after been devoured by the Salvages. But that which makes it the more agreeable, to allow the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> an <HI>Article</HI> in our <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> is, That a certain silly Scribbler, the very First-born of <HI>Non-sensicality,</HI> (and a <HI>First-born</HI> too, that one might Salute as the Martyr <HI>Polycarp</HI> once did the wicked <HI>Marcion,</HI>) One <HI>Tom Maule;</HI> at this Time Living in <HI>Salem,</HI> hath exposed unto the Publick, a Volumn of <HI>Nonsensical</HI> Blasphemies and Haeresies, wherein he sets himself to Defend
<PB N="163" REF="82"/> the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their Bloody Villanies, and Revile the Countrey for Defending it self against them. And that the <HI>Venome</HI> of this Pamphlet might be Improved unto the <HI>Heighth</HI> of <HI>Slanderous Wick∣edness,</HI> there hath been since added unto it, in a∣nother Pamphlet, a parcel of Ingredients com∣pounded, for mischief, as if <HI>by the Art of the A∣pothecary.</HI> None but he, whom the Jewes, in their <HI>Talmuds</HI> call, <HI>Ben-tamalion</HI> could have inspi∣red such a Slanderer! Have the <HI>Quakers</HI> ever yet Censured, this their Author, for holding forth in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> [pag. 221.] <HI>That the Devil, Sin, Death, and Hell, are but Nothing, they are but a Non-Entity:</HI> And, [pag. 183.] That <HI>all men who have a Body of Sin remaining in them, are</HI> Witches? I have cause to believe, that they never did! Nor that they ever advised him to pull in his <HI>Horns,</HI> from goring the sides of <HI>New-England,</HI> with such passages as those, in [pag. 195.] the same horrible Pamphlet: <HI>God hath well Rewarded the Inhabitants of</HI> New-England, <HI>for their Unrighteous Dealings, towards the Native Indians, whom now the Lord hath suffered to Rew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Inhabitants, with a double measure of Blood, by Fire and Sword, &amp;c.</HI> And those <HI>Unrighteous Dealings,</HI> he Explains, to be the Killing of the <HI>Indians,</HI> (or Murdering of them) by the Old Planters of these <HI>Colonies,</HI> in their <HI>First Settle∣ment.</HI> Thus are the Ashes of our <HI>Fathers</HI> vilely <HI>staled</HI> upon, by one, who perhaps would not
<PB N="164" REF="83"/> stick at the Villany of doing as much upon their <HI>Baptism</HI> it self. I must tell you, Friends, that if you don't publickly, <HI>give forth a Testimony</HI> to Defy, <HI>Tom Maule,</HI> and <HI>his Works,</HI> it will be thought by some, who it may be don't wish you so well, as I do, that you own this <HI>Bloody Stuff:</HI> which, doubtless you'l not be so ill advi∣sed as to do. But, certainly, if the good peo∣ple of <HI>New-England,</HI> now make it not a proverb for a <HI>Lyar</HI> of the First Magnitude, <HI>He is as very a Lyar as</HI> TOM MAULE; they will deprive their Language of one Significant Ex∣pression, which now offers it self unto them.</P>
<P>Let us now Leave our Friend <HI>Maules</HI> Works, as a fit Volumn to be an <HI>Appendix</HI> unto the fa∣mous <HI>Tartaretus,</HI> and worthy of a Room in <HI>Pantagruels</HI> Library. The fittest way to answer him, would be to send him to <HI>Boston Woods!</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, I owe unto the Publick, a piece of <HI>History,</HI> which it may be for the Safe∣ty of our <HI>Northern Towns,</HI> to be acquainted with∣al. Know, Sirs, That once the famous <HI>George Keith,</HI> undertook to be the Champion of our <HI>New-English</HI> Quakers; and bid fair to be the very <HI>Dalae,</HI> or <HI>Prester John,</HI> of all the English <HI>Tartars;</HI> but a Minister of <HI>Boston,</HI> upon that oc∣casion, publishing a Book, Entituled, <HI>Little Flocks guarded against grievous Wolves,</HI> could not but complain of it, as a very <HI>Scandalous Thing,</HI> in <HI>George Keith,</HI> to maintain the points of the <HI>Foxian
<PB N="165" REF="83"/> Quakerism,</HI> while he really differed from them. All this while, <HI>George Keith</HI> was admired by our <HI>Quakers,</HI> as an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or, an <HI>Oracle:</HI> but, he finding it impossible to mentain the gross Tenets of the common <HI>Quakers,</HI> preach'd unto them the Necessity of Believing on a <HI>Christ without,</HI> as well as a <HI>Christ within.</HI> Hereupon, there grew such alienations between him, and the other <HI>Quakers,</HI> (who had been taught by <HI>George Fox,</HI> to say, <HI>The Devil is in them, who say, they are Saved by Christ without them:</HI>) that he not only ha's written diverse Learned Books, to confute those very Doctrines of the Common <HI>Quakers,</HI> which the Pastors of <HI>New-England</HI> had, upon his Pro∣vocation, Written against, but also ha's therefore undergone a Storm of <HI>Persecution,</HI> from the Friends in <HI>Pensylvania:</HI> Yea, 'tis verily thought, that poor <HI>George</HI> would have been made a Sacri∣fice to Squire <HI>Samael Jennings,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Pensylvanian Dragons,</HI> and that, since a crime which their Laws ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made <HI>Capital,</HI> was men∣tion'd in the <HI>Mittimus</HI> whereby <HI>Keith</HI> was com∣mitted, they would have Hang'd him, if a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣volution</HI> upon their Government had not set him at liberty. Being by the Fines, and Gaols, and Fierce Usages of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Pensylvania,</HI> dri¦ven over to <HI>England,</HI> the Wonderful Hand of God, hath made this very man, I think I may say, incomparably the greatest <HI>Plague,</HI> that ever came upon that Sect, of <HI>Energumens.</HI> Although
<PB N="166" REF="84"/> he do himself still retain the Name of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> yet he hath in one Treatise after another, Ear∣nestly called upon the Divines, throughout the Nation, more Vigorously to Employ their <HI>Ta∣lants,</HI> against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as a more <HI>Dangerous Generation</HI> of People than they are well aware; and he did in the year 1696. with the leave of the <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> Challenge the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to make their Appearance at <HI>Turners Hall,</HI> in the chief City of <HI>Europe;</HI> where he proved unto the Satis∣faction of a vast Assembly, that the chief Writers of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> assert <HI>Christ</HI> neither to be <HI>God,</HI> nor <HI>Man;</HI> and that they deny <HI>Christ</HI> to be pray'd unto; and that they had affirm'd, <HI>Christs out∣ward Blood, shed on the Ground, to be no more than the Blood of another Saint;</HI> and that they had charged him with <HI>New-Doctrine,</HI> for directing to <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ without us,</HI> as well as <HI>within us;</HI> and that at their Meetings, they had censured him, for saying, <HI>That Christs Body came out of the Grave,</HI> which they say, <HI>It never did:</HI> And many more such horrid matters. To confirm these things, Besides the grievous <HI>Bites</HI> which <HI>Francis Bugg,</HI> one of their late Friends, hath given them, one <HI>Daniel Leeds,</HI> without wholly casting off the Profession of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> hath lately Printed a Book, wherein he produces above <HI>Threescore</HI> In∣stances, of the <HI>Flat Contradictions,</HI> which he hath observed in the Books of the <HI>Friends,</HI> that have most pretended unto <HI>Infallibility;</HI> and he demon∣strates
<PB N="167" REF="84"/> from evident matter of East, that though they declared unto the World, <HI>That their Suffe∣rings had been greater, and more unjust, than the Sufferings of Jesus, and His Apostles;</HI> yet they themselves were no sooner mounted into the Seat of Government, than they fell to <HI>Persecuting</HI> as bad as any in the World. Albeit <HI>Fox</HI> writes, <HI>They that cause People to be put in Prison, and have their Goods taken away, are Disorderly Teachers, and shall be rooted out:</HI> Nevertheless <HI>Leeds</HI> proves by many Exemples, that the <HI>Pensylvanians</HI> did it, even upon their own Friends, for meer <HI>Scruples</HI> of their <HI>Consciences.</HI> 'Tis reported, The <HI>Quakers</HI> are so confounded at this Book of <HI>Leeds,</HI> that they have been at the charge to buy up the <HI>whole Impression</HI> of it, and so to Stiffle and Smo∣ther it: If it be so, I hope 'twill but produce a <HI>New Impression</HI> of so rare a Book. The <HI>Marvel∣lous Providence</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, having thus employ'd, the Pens of the <HI>Quakers</HI> them∣selves, to warn you, that you beware of <HI>Quaker∣ism,</HI> it will be a marvellous Infatuation in any of <HI>you,</HI> after this, to be led away with <HI>that Error of the Wicked.</HI> Reader, make a Pause, and here Admire the <HI>Marvellous Providence</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ! The first and great Apostle of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> even <HI>George Fox,</HI> the Shoe-maker, in his, <HI>Great Mystery,</HI> Pag. 94. Excludes from the Church of Christ, Those who <HI>are not Infallible, in Discern∣ing the Hearts of other men.</HI> Whereas now in
<PB N="168" REF="85"/> Spite of all their <HI>Infallibility,</HI> such Friends as <HI>Keith</HI> (and <HI>Leeds</HI>) whom they once admired, profess that they never in their <HI>Hearts Believed,</HI> as the Common <HI>Foxian Quakers</HI> do; and <HI>Qua∣kerism</HI> Suffers from none in the world more than these. But that I may a little Suggest unto you, certain Methods of Encountring those Adversa∣ries of your <HI>Faith,</HI> which <HI>go about, seeking whom they may deceive,</HI> and whom I do here offer to prove as horrid <HI>Idolaters,</HI> as even those that worshipp'd the Rats of <HI>Egypt,</HI> if it be fairly demanded of me, I will first Recite unto you, certain passages, of a Discourse, which a Minister of <HI>Boston,</HI> had with a very Busy and Noisy Teacher among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> (and another of the <HI>Friends,</HI>) in his Return from his <HI>Visitation</HI> unto some of our Northern Towns, where the Giddy People, had cry'd him up for a <HI>None-Such.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We are come to give thee a Friendly Visit.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to see you, at my House; you shall be welcome to the best Entertain∣ments, my House can afford you.</P>
<P>But will you do me the Favour, to let me understand, the Designs upon which you visit these parts of the Country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I come to preach Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me— What <HI>Christ,</HI> I pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The same Christ, that appeared unto</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="85"/> Abraham, <HI>and</HI> Isaac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob; <HI>and that appear∣ed unto</HI> Moses <HI>in the Bush, and that was with</HI> Israel <HI>in the Wilderness.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would interrupt you. I perceive, that we shall be drawn into some Discourse. Matter of <HI>Argument</HI> will occur, I foresee, in our Discourse. <HI>Argument</HI> sometimes does draw forth <HI>Words</HI> that may have too much <HI>Warmth</HI> in them. I purpose none such. But if you are sensible, that I do let fall any <HI>one such word,</HI> in our Disputation, do me the favour, to take notice of it unto me, and I'le immediately cor∣rect it. Now, if you please; —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Thou speakest very well. This is but according to the Good Report we have heard of thee.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, I am sensible, that you are come among us, to preach a <HI>Religion,</HI> different from that which is commonly Preached, Professed, &amp; Practised in the Country. If you approve the <HI>Religion</HI> of the Country, I can't see, where's the Sense of it, for <HI>you</HI> to take such tedious Journeys for our Illumination. I pray, be so kind as to let me know, what point in our Holy <HI>Religion,</HI> you do <HI>not</HI> Approve?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>'Tis not my Business here to Enquire in∣to thy Religion. I am come to preach the Religion of Jesus Christ; the same that the Holy Prophets and Apostles believed; even the Inward manifestation of Christ in our Hearts,</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>To make short work on it; I per∣ceive
<PB N="170" REF="86"/> you both to be that sort of people, we call <HI>Quakers.</HI> Now, there is among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that extream Uncertainty, Varie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and Con∣tradiction, that no man, can say what you hold, any further than each <HI>Individual Person,</HI> will con∣fess his own Tenets. I must therefore, pray the favour of you, to tell me; Do you own <HI>George Foxes</HI> Book, Entituled, <HI>The Great My∣stery?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>'Tis none of our Business, to tell what Books we own, and what we do not own: And it is none of thy Business to Ask us. I say, We own Je∣sus Christ, and His Inward Manifestation in our Hearts. And that's Enough!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'l Excuse me: I do again ask, whether you do own <HI>George Foxes</HI> Book, of, <HI>The Great Mystery?</HI> Because doubtless you have Read it. And if you'l ask <HI>me,</HI> as much con∣cerning any Book under Heaven, (that I have Read,) <HI>Whether</HI> I own it, or, <HI>How much</HI> I own of it, I'l answer you with all the Freedom in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I say, What hast thou to do with</HI> George Fox? <HI>or, to Examine me?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Friend, I do, and must, and will Examine <HI>You.</HI> For you are come to <HI>Hold Forth</HI> unto as many of <HI>my Flock,</HI> as you can. And the Word of God bids me to <HI>Try</HI> you. And, I have to do with <HI>George Eox</HI> too: because <HI>George Fox,</HI> in his Writings, has to do with <HI>me.</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="86"/> And if you will sincerely tell me, whether you own <HI>George Fox,</HI> or no, I shall more probably tell, <HI>who</HI> you are. In short; If you'l say, you Deny and Renounce <HI>George Fox,</HI> then I must go another way to work with you. If you'l say you own him, then I must endeavour to Save you, from some of his <HI>Damnable Haeresies.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What Haeresies?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Numberless. But I do at this Time call to mind <HI>Three</HI> of them.</P>
<P>First. <HI>That the Soul of man, is without Begin∣ning, and Infinite.</HI> This is, if I forget not, in the 90th page of that Book.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>That it is not contrary to the Scrip∣ture, That God the Father took upon Him Humane Nature.</HI> And, <HI>That the Scripture does not tell peo∣ple of a Trinity, nor Three Persons in God; but that these Three Persons were brought in by the Pope.</HI></P>
<P>This is in pag. 246.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>That they that are not compleat in San∣ctification, are not compleat in Justification.</HI></P>
<P>This is in, pag. 284. Now,</P>
<P>What say ye, Syrs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What hast thou to do, to Rake into the Ashes of the Dead? Let</HI> George Fox <HI>alone. Hast thou any thing to charge upon me?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall know, if you'l tell me, whe∣ther you own <HI>George Fox</HI> or no. And you <HI>can</HI> tell me, if you <HI>will.</HI> I would be more civil to <HI>you,</HI> Syrs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="172" REF="87"/>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I never saw that Book of</HI> George Fox.</P>
<P>[And so said, the other <HI>Quaker,</HI> that was with him.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Syrs, you astonish me! What? Ne∣ver see <HI>George Foxes</HI> Book, of, <HI>The Great Mystery!</HI> 'Tis impossible! This Thing is to <HI>me,</HI> a <HI>Myste∣ry!</HI> Syrs, That Book is the very <HI>Bible</HI> of <HI>Quake∣rism.</HI> 'Tis Essential unto a <HI>Quaker,</HI> at least, un∣to a <HI>Teaching Quaker,</HI> as you are, to be <HI>Indoctri∣nated</HI> from that Book. Never see it, man!— However, if you say so, I must Believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>[Fell into an Harangue, <HI>Repeating</HI> what he had Preached abroad, about the Coun∣trey; which, because I would misrecite no∣thing, I dare not undertake exactly to Recite in this place.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive our Conversation, will be to little Advantage, except we get a little closer to some <HI>certain point,</HI> which I have hitherto En∣deavoured but ineffectually.</P>
<P>Syrs, There are several points, which I would willingly bring you to. And there happening to be several of my Honest Neighbours at hand, I have pray'd them (with your leave,) to walk in, that they may be Witnesses of what passes between us.</P>
<P>First, I'll begin, if you please, with <HI>This.</HI></P>
<P>I told you at the Beginning, I would not wil∣lingly Treat you, with one <HI>Hard word.</HI> There is an <HI>Hard word,</HI> which will presently occur, by
<PB N="173" REF="87"/> the unavoidable course of Disputation. I would pray you, to ease me of the Trouble of speak∣ing it. You shall your self have the speaking of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What's that?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, Friend, what doth the Scrip∣ture say, of them that say, <HI>They know Jesus Christ,</HI> and yet <HI>keep not His Commandments?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay, What dost thou say, the Scripture sayes in that case?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will compel me, I see.—I say then: The Scripture saies, <HI>He that says, I know Him, and keeps not His Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</HI> 'Tis in 1 Joh. 2.4.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>And what then?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>this</HI> then. He that says, <HI>I know Jesus Christ,</HI> and yet <HI>keeps not the Command∣ments</HI> of Jesus Christ, is a <HI>Lyar,</HI> and the <HI>Truth is not in him.</HI></P>
<P>You say, <HI>You know Jesus Christ.</HI> But you must give <HI>me</HI> leave to say, That you <HI>Keep not the Com∣mandments</HI> of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI>—pray Syrs, do <HI>you</HI> help out the <HI>Con∣clusion.</HI> I am loth to speak it. You know what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, yes. We know well enough what Conclusion, thou wouldest be at: Thou wouldest say, That we are Lyars, and that the Truth is not in us.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right! Since it must be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But what Commandment of Jesus Christ, is there, that we don't keep?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="174" REF="88"/>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Commandment of Jesus Christ, is, For His Disciples to be <HI>Baptised with Water;</HI> But you, <HI>Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kers,</HI> do not keep that Com∣mandment of Jesus Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How dost thou prove, that Jesus Christ commanded Baptism with Water?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, you must have the word, <HI>Water,</HI> or nothing will content you. Else I would have urged, for a Sufficient proof, our Lords Commanding His Ministers, to <HI>Baptise</HI> men, [Matth. 28.19.] This <HI>Command</HI> Expresses our <HI>Duty.</HI> 'Tis not our <HI>Duty</HI> to <HI>Baptise</HI> men with the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> This belongs not unto <HI>Us,</HI> but unto <HI>Him,</HI> who's that <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is. You will not say, we <HI>Sin,</HI> if we don't <HI>Baptise</HI> the Disciples in all Nations, with the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> So then, it must be a <HI>Baptism with Water,</HI> which is there Commanded by our Lord. But, as I said, you must have the word, <HI>Water;</HI> &amp; you shall have it.</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> said,—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Apostle</HI> Peter! <HI>The Apostle</HI> Peter! <HI>Thou wast to prove that Jesus Christ Commanded Bap∣tism with Water. And now, Thou art come to the Apostle</HI> Peter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, Friend; not so fast! Will you say then, that the Commandments brought by the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> as the Commandments of Je∣sus Christ, are not the Commandments of Jesus Christ? But however, I'le mend the Expression,—</P>
<P>The <HI>Spirit</HI> of Jesus Christ in the Apostle <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="88"/> (Now, I hope, it fits you!)—</P>

<P>[J. S.] <HI>Thou art a Monster, all Mouth, and no Ears,</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Prethee, talk Civilly, Don't make me Believe, that I am at <HI>Ephesus.</HI> If I were in one of <HI>your</HI> Houses, I would not give <HI>you</HI> such Language; you had but now, a greater liberty to use your <HI>Mouth,</HI> than I have hitherto taken; and my <HI>Ears</HI> were patient. But, you foresee my Argument, is going to pinch you. 'Tis but <HI>Civility</HI> to let me Finish it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Thou wast to prove, that Jesus Christ Commanded Baptism with Water. And thou hast not proved it. And therefore thou Speakest Falsely.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? These little <HI>Shuffles</HI> won't help you.</P>
<P>I say, The <HI>Spirit</HI> of Jesus Christ, in the A∣postle <HI>Peter,</HI> after our Lords Ascension, when it was Impossible for <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism (which was into the <HI>Messiah</HI> Suddenly to come, not, already come,) should have place, did say, in Act. 10 47. <HI>Can any man Forbid Water, that these should not be Baptised, which have Received the Holy Ghost?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How does this prove, That Jesus Christ Commanded these to be Baptised with water?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus; —</P>
<P>If Jesus Christ had not <HI>Commanded Baptism with Water,</HI> any man might have then <HI>Forbid</HI> it.</P>
<P>But, no man could <HI>Forbid</HI> it.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore</HI> Jesus Christ Commanded it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="176" REF="89"/>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Therefore! Therefore!</HI> Argo, Argo! <HI>Why, Dost thou think, Religion is to be proved by thy</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>efore's, <HI>by thy</HI> Argo's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, I perceive, the word, <HI>There∣fore,</HI> is a ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dead doing sort of a Word to yee. I'le dismiss this Terrible Word. I'le only say, The Reason, why none could forbid Believers to be <HI>Baptised with Water,</HI> was meerly <HI>Because</HI> Jesus Christ Commanded it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>BECAUSE; <HI>Why, the word,</HI> Because <HI>is as bad as the word,</HI> Therefore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>[Smiling.] It may be so. But in the mean time, you are wonderfully unreasona∣ble! I say, why could none <HI>forbid Water,</HI> for the Faithful to be <HI>Baptised.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Who sayes, None could Forbid Water? 'Tis only said, Can any man Forbid Water?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, Syrs; And is not this, <HI>None can.</HI></P>
<P>But I'l bring the matter to bear upon you, without those two Dangerous words, THERE∣FORE, and BECAUSE; at which you are so terrified.</P>
<P>I will put the matter into the Form of a <HI>Question:</HI> And your <HI>Answer</HI> to this <HI>Question,</HI> shall put an End, to our present Velitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What have we to do to Answer thy Questions?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Question is,</P>
<P><HI>Whether a man might not forbid in the Worship
<PB N="177" REF="89"/> of Jesus Christ, what Jesus Christ Himself hath no way Commanded?</HI></P>
<P>You can Answer this <HI>Question,</HI> if you will; &amp; I desire, I demand your <HI>Answer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What? For us to answer thy Questions! That would be, to Ensnare our selves.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sensible of <HI>That.</HI> There∣fore, take Notice, You are <HI>Ensnared,</HI> in the <HI>Toyls</HI> of your own miserable Delusions. But still, I say, Answer my <HI>Question.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Do you see, Neighbours? Friend</HI> M. <HI>was to prove, that Jesus Christ commanded Baptism, and now, he's come to a Question!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I am Truly. And, I see 'tis a <HI>Question,</HI> that puts you into a <HI>Sweat.</HI> I beseech you to <HI>Answer</HI> it. I <HI>Require</HI> you to Answer it. What shall I say? I <HI>Defy</HI> you to Answer it. Par∣don my <HI>Cogency;</HI> You <HI>Force</HI> me to 't!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I say, How does a Question prove, That Jesus Christ commanded Baptism with Water? And why dost thou Baptise Infants?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I'le keep you to the <HI>Question.</HI> Your <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Question,</HI> will prove it; I am designing to make <HI>you your selves</HI> prove it. And, Sirs, I do here offer to you, That I will give the best <HI>Answer</HI> I can, to any <HI>Question</HI> in the world, that you shall put unto <HI>me:</HI> why are you so loath to Answer one short <HI>Question</HI> of mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I be not obliged to Answer thy Question?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must contrive some fair way, to

Yea, Sirs, I must in Faithful∣ness tell you, That you carry away, the dreadful Mark of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> upon you, Even, <HI>To be Con∣demned in your own Conscience.</HI> You go away, <HI>Self-Condemned,</HI> That you don't keep the <HI>Com∣mandments of Jesus Christ;</HI> and Therefore, That you are, — what, you Remember, the Apostle <HI>John</HI> said concerning you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I don't condemn Thee, for using Baptism with Water.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is no <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Question</HI> still: For you don't observe it your self; nei∣ther you, nor any <HI>Quakers</HI> under Heaven. Where∣fore I still urge for an <HI>Answer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Thou art not Civil to us. Is this thy Ci∣vility to Strangers?

But now thou are uncivil to us. That which I have to say, is, I will keep to that Book, the Bible, and I will preach what is in that Book.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>[Taking up the Bible,] Friend, you pretend then to understand <HI>this Book.</HI> I do here make you this offer; That I will immedi∣ately Turn you to <HI>Ten</HI> several places, in one Book of this Holy Bible, [the <HI>Chronicles,</HI>] And if you can give me a Tolerable Solution of any <HI>one</HI> of

<SP>

<P>Look you, Neighbours: I think, 'tis to no purpose, to proceed unto any other points, with such <HI>unreasonable Folks</HI> as these. You see, how <HI>'Tis.</HI> If <HI>you</HI> desire it, I'l proceed.</P>

<P><HI>Nay, Friend</HI> M.— <HI>I would not have thee to be so Hard upon us. I mean Thee no Harm. I hear, thou takest a great deal of pains for the good of thy people.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You differ from all your <HI>Friends,</HI> me∣thinks. What? Would you have us to be <HI>Hire∣lings?</HI> 'Tis very strange to hear a <HI>Quaker</HI> plead for the <HI>Maintainance</HI> of our <HI>Ministry.</HI> But for your satisfaction, I'l tell you, The people whom I Serve, I never once in all my Life <HI>Ask'd</HI> for any <HI>Maintainance</HI> or Salary; and I never made

<P>Nay, Friends, Be not you too Hard upon <HI>me,</HI> about that matter. I Approve <HI>Perse∣cution,</HI> as Little as any of you all. I <HI>abhor</HI> it; I have <HI>Preach'd</HI> against it, I have <HI>Writ</HI> against it, I have <HI>Bewayled</HI> the mistakes that some Good men have committed in it.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I can't tell <HI>That</HI> neither. For tho' I am sorry at my Heart, that ever you were Persecuted: Yet, I can't say, That because <HI>Bo∣ston</HI> was guilty of Persecution, therefore <HI>Newi∣chawannic,</HI> and <HI>Casc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bay,</HI> (places in other Pro∣vinces,) that never had any such thing in it, must be cut off.</P>

<P><HI>Yes, they Persecuted at the East ward. There were Two Women, of our Friends, cruel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Scourged there.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, you refer to a Story, published by one <HI>George Bishop,</HI> a Quaker: He
<PB N="181" REF="91"/> Complains bitterly, of the <HI>New England Persecu∣tion,</HI> because there came Two Quaker women Stark Naked, into our Publick Assemblies, and they were carried unto the Whipping post for it. This was in the Northern parts of the Country, as I have been told. These Baggages, I believe, were the persecuted women, you talk of!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, and what if they did appear Nak∣ed, to show the People the Nakedness of their Sins?</HI></P>

<P>For Shame, Sirs, let us have no more of This Talk.</P>

<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why didst thou treat</HI> George Keith <HI>so hardly?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>He deserved it, when I so Treated him. And you <HI>Quakers,</HI> have since Treated him Ten Times worse than ever I did. You write whole Books of Railing against him. I never got him into <HI>Goals,</HI> and under <HI>Fines.</HI> I should have been Troubled at any that would have done so. But <HI>you</HI> have done it. Therefore, I believe, 'tis best for you to leave that Subject.</P>
</SP>
<P>And so after a few other small <HI>Pulls,</HI> the <HI>Saw</HI> stood still. The <HI>Conference</HI> ended.</P>
<P>There are Five or Six witnesses, which I have to attest unto the Truth of this Relation, which I have here given, of a <HI>Conference,</HI> with a <HI>Quaker,</HI> which had all the <HI>Friends</HI> far and near <HI>wondering</HI> (as well as <HI>wandring) after him.</HI> And yet these <HI>Cretians</HI> boasted among their Friends, how much they had confounded the Minister in this <HI>Con∣ference.</HI></P>
<PB N="182" REF="92"/>
<P>All that I would presume now to Commend unto those <HI>Towns,</HI> which have such <HI>Quakers</HI> an∣noying of them, is This <HI>Brethren,</HI> carry it <HI>well,</HI> even with all convenient <HI>Civility</HI> &amp; <HI>Humanity,</HI> towards this Poor Deluded People; while you Charge your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> that they do not go unto their <HI>Meetings:</HI> and cast not your selves also into <HI>Temptation,</HI> by needlessly being <HI>There.</HI> But after all, yea, <HI>before all,</HI> make an Experi∣ment, which the Good People at <HI>Lyn</HI> made a little while ago, with a Success truly observable and memorable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> made a more than ordinary De∣scent upon the Town of <HI>Lyn,</HI> and <HI>Quakerism</HI> suddenly spread there, at such a rate as to A∣larum the Neighbourhood. The Pastor of the Church there, Indicted a Day, for <HI>Prayer with Fasting,</HI> to Implore the Help of Heaven against the unaccountable <HI>Enchantment;</HI> and the Good People presented accordingly, on <HI>July</HI> 19 1694. their fervent Supplica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, unto the Lord, that the <HI>Spiritual Plague</HI> might proceed no further. The Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our Lord Jesus Christ gave a Re∣markable Effect, unto this Holy Method of En∣countring the Charms of <HI>Quakerism:</HI> It proved a Better method, than any Coercion of the Civil Magistrate: <HI>Quakerism</HI> in <HI>Lyn</HI> received (as I am informed) a <HI>Death-Wound,</HI> from that very Day; The Number of <HI>Quakers</HI> in that place hath been so far from <HI>Increasing,</HI> that I am
<PB N="183" REF="92"/> told, it hath since rather <HI>Decreased</HI> notably. Now let other Endangered Plantations; <HI>Go, and do likewise.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI> are such Enemies, to the Holy <HI>Religion,</HI> which is the Life of <HI>New England,</HI> That you must Excuse my concern to have you For∣tify'd against <HI>their</HI> Attempts also, while I am giving you an <HI>History</HI> of your <HI>other Enemies.</HI> What <HI>all</HI> of them would be at, methinks, was a little intimated by what <HI>One</HI> of them once De∣clared. The <HI>Globe Tavern</HI> was near our Publick and Spacious <HI>Meeting-House</HI> at <HI>Salem:</HI> and a No∣ted <HI>Quaker</HI> there caused a paper to be set up on the Door of that Meeting-House, which had such Stuff as this written in it.</P>
<Q><L>Beware, Beware, and Enter not:</L>
<L>But rather to the Globe, and spend a Pot.</L></Q>
<P>This is but like a passage mentioned in the Life, of that Excellent man Mr. P. <HI>Henry,</HI> lately published. A Debauched Gentleman, in his Re∣vels, Drinking and Swearing, at <HI>Malpas,</HI> was Re∣proved by a Quaker, then in his Company. Why, said the Gentleman, I'le ask thee one Question; Whether it is better for me to follow Drinking and Swearing, or to go and Hear <HI>Henry?</HI> The Quaker answered; <HI>Nay, of the Two, rather follow thy Drinking and Swearing.</HI> Behold, the Spirit of <HI>Quakerism!</HI> When I once compelled a <HI>Quaker</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="93"/> to confess, that the Body of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> rose from the Grave, and went up into the Hea∣vens, he begg'd me that I would not improve his confession, as if made on the behalf of all his Friends. And another of them, as, I hear, pub∣lickly <HI>Held Forth</HI> by one of his late <HI>Stercorations,</HI> That the <HI>Husks</HI> of the <HI>Swine,</HI> on which the <HI>Pro∣digal</HI> fed in the <HI>Parable,</HI> were, The <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> in that which People call, <HI>The Sacrament.</HI></P>
<P>But what will become of those Forlorn Villages, that shall Resign themselves to the conduct of that <HI>Light within;</HI> which our Sa∣cred Scriptures indeed never expresly mention but once or twice, and then call it, <HI>Real Dark∣ness;</HI> and which may lead men to all this wick∣edness? There was among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in the Eastern parts of the World, a Sect called <HI>Batenists,</HI> from the Arabic, <HI>Baten,</HI> which sig∣nifies <HI>within:</HI>) who were Enthusiasts that fol∣lowed, <HI>The Light within,</HI> like our <HI>Quakers;</HI> and on this principle, they did such Numberless Vil∣lanies, that the World was not able to bear them. None of all their Diabolical <HI>Raveries</HI> which I know I am now pulling on my self, and which I value no more, than if they came from the <HI>Pouliats</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI> shall frighten me from solliciting your <HI>Christian</HI> Cares &amp; Prayers, That you be not over-run with English <HI>Batenists.</HI> And I must sollicitously make the Observation, That although such a Number of <HI>Quakers</HI> in our
<PB N="185" REF="93"/> Nation, be a dreadful <HI>Judgment</HI> of God upon men, smiting them with <HI>Spiritual Plagues</HI> for their Unfruitfulness and Unthankfulness under the Gospel; nevertheless, of a special <HI>Favour</HI> of God, that the Number of <HI>Quakers</HI> is no Greater; for if they should multiply, not only would <HI>Christianity</HI> be utterly Extinguished, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut <HI>Humanity</HI> it self Exterminated. It is well known, That when a <HI>Quaker</HI> had Stollen an <HI>Hour-glass,</HI> their <HI>Mahomet, George Fox</HI> of whom <HI>Sol. Eccles,</HI> in a Sheet call'd, <HI>The Quakers Challenge,</HI> pag. 6. saies, <HI>He was the Christ,</HI>) thus vindicated it [<HI>Great Myst.</HI> pag. 77.] <HI>As for any being moved of the Lord, to take away your Hour-glass from you, by the Eternal Power it is owned.</HI> Reader, Dost not thou even <HI>Tremble</HI> to think, what a <HI>Dark Land,</HI> we should have, if it should ever be fill'd with these pretended followers of the <HI>Light;</HI> who wear the Name of <HI>Tremblers?</HI> In Truth, I know not unto what better one might com∣pare them, than unto the <HI>Macheveliers</HI> growing upon St. <HI>Lucia;</HI> Trees which bear Apples of such an Odour and Colour as invites people to Eat thereof; but it is horribly Dangerous to do so; for there is no Antidote that can secure a man from speedy Death, who hath once tasted of them.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE XXX.</HI> Things to Come.</HEAD>
<P>FRom <HI>Relating</HI> of <HI>Things past,</HI> it would no doubt, be very Acceptable to the Reader if we could pass to <HI>Foretelling</HI> of <HI>Things to come</HI> Our <HI>Curiosity</HI> in this point may easily come to a, Degree <HI>Culpable,</HI> and <HI>Criminal.</HI> We must be Humbly content, with what the <HI>God</HI> in whose <HI>Hands</HI> are our <HI>Times,</HI> hath <HI>Reveal'd</HI> unto us.</P>
<P><HI>Two</HI> Things we will venture to Insert.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> For <HI>our selves,</HI> at home, Let us Remem∣ber an awful Saying of our <HI>Goodwin,</HI> quoted by my Reverend Friend, Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> in his late Excellent Sermon at our Anniversary <HI>Election.</HI></P>

<P>Secondly. For <HI>the Church</HI> abroad, I am far from deserting, what was Asserted, in the Sermon Preached at our Anniversary Election, in the year, 1696. <Q REND="margQuotes">The <HI>Tidings</HI> which I bring unto you, are, That there is a <HI>Revolution,</HI> and a <HI>Reformation,</HI> at the very Door, which will be vastly more wonderful, than any of the Deliverances yet seen by the Church of God, from the Beginning of the World. I do
<PB N="187" REF="94"/> not say, That the <HI>Next year</HI> will bring on this <HI>Happy Period:</HI> but this I do say, The Bigger part of this Assembly, may, in the course of Nature, Live to see it. These Things will come on, with horrible Commotions, and Concussions, and Confusions: The mighty Angels of the Lord Jesus Christ, will make their Descent, and set the World a <HI>Trembling</HI> at the Approaches of their Almighty Lord: They will <HI>Shake</HI> Nations, and <HI>Shake</HI> Church∣es, and <HI>Shake</HI> mighty Kingdoms, and <HI>Shake once more, not Earth only, but Heaven also.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Unto these <HI>Two</HI> Things, my Reader will not misimprove it, I hope, if I add a <HI>Third,</HI> lately fallen into my Hands; and never yet so Expo∣sed unto the Publick.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the <HI>Israelites</HI> were Engaged in a WAR, they made choice of a <HI>Priest</HI> among them, to Serve some of their greatest Occasions in it, and after a <HI>Sacred Unction</HI> bestow'd upon him, we are told by <HI>Maimonides,</HI> he was call'd <HI>Mashuach Milchamah,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Unctus Belli;</HI> which was as much as to say, <HI>The Priest of the War.</HI></P>
<P>To bring unto a People profitable Advices &amp; Reflections upon a WAR, wherein they are En∣gaged, and sound the <HI>Silver Trumpet,</HI> of the Gos∣pel, with agreeable Notes unto them in it, is to do in some sort, the Office of the <HI>Mashuach Mil∣chamah;</HI> and this Office the Ensuing Discourse presumes to do, with Endeavours that the Voice of Heaven by the <HI>Trumpet</HI> of our late <HI>War,</HI> may he heard giving a <HI>certain Sound,</HI> in these <HI>Echo's</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The History of a long <HI>War,</HI> hath, with all pos∣sible care of <HI>Truth,</HI> been given you. The Author Earnestly prayes, that if the least material <HI>Mistake</HI> have happened in the History, <HI>He</HI> may be Ad∣vised, &amp; <HI>It</HI> may be corrected. The Noise that may be made, by a few Sordid People, here &amp; there, in a Room <HI>Tophetized</HI> with Smoke, and Rhum, and Spittle, and Malice, and <HI>Lyes,</HI> crying out concerning the most Conscientious Essayes, to preserve <HI>Memorable Truths, They are a parcel of Lies!</HI> He values not. But he now tenders to the Acceptance of the more <HI>Civilized Readers,</HI> an Improvement of <HI>Memorable Truths,</HI> which it was <HI>His</HI> Duty to <HI>make,</HI> &amp; it will be <HI>Theirs</HI> to <HI>mind.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE REMARKEABLES of a long WAR, Collected and Improved. <HI>Boston</HI>-Lecture, 27<HI>d.</HI> 7<HI>m.</HI> 1698.</HEAD>
<P>IF a <HI>Book</HI> of some Consequence, be laid open before one that cannot <HI>Read,</HI> he may Look, and Gaze upon it; but unto what purpose, as long as he cannot un∣derstand it? This very Comparison, is by the Great <HI>Austin</HI> well applyed unto, The <HI>Judgments</HI> of God. And I will therefore so far Improve the Comparison, as to observe, That the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, under which we have been Languishing for <HI>Ten years</HI> together, are a sort of a <HI>Book</HI> put into our Hands; a <HI>Book</HI> indeed all writ∣ten in <HI>Blood;</HI> a <HI>Book</HI> yet full of <HI>Divine Lessons</HI> for us. But can every man Read this Terrible
<PB N="202" REF="102"/> <HI>Books?</HI> No, Methinks, I see the <HI>Book</HI> managed like the <HI>Book</HI> brought unto the Blessed Prophet of old, in Isa. 29.12. <HI>The Book is delivered unto him that is not Learned, Saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not Learned.</HI> It will cer∣tainly be a work, well becoming a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel, and every Serious <HI>Christian</HI> will be glad of seeing the Work done; To take this <HI>Book,</HI> and help you, as well as we can to <HI>Spell</HI> the <HI>Di∣vine Lessons</HI> contained in it</P>
<P><HI>Christians,</HI> Let us now do a work, for which the Great God hath given us, that Warrant, and that Command, in</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSAL. CVII. 43.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Who is Wise, and will observe these Things?</P></Q>
<P>THe various and marvellous Dispensations of the Divine Providence, towards the Chil∣dren of men, are in this Elegant <HI>Psalm</HI> admirably set before us. Among those Dispensations, there is a particular mark set upon this, That the God of Heaven <HI>Turns a Fruitful Land into Barrenness, for the Wickedness of them which dwell therein;</HI> &amp; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh men have <HI>Sown Fields there and have multiplied greatly, yet they are again Diminished, &amp; brought Low through Oppression, Affliction, and Sor∣row.</HI> Of such Dispensations, is this passage to be understood, as a Quaestion, <HI>Who is wise, and will observe these things?</HI> But if you will rather take it
<PB N="203" REF="102"/> as a Sentence, it still comes to the same sense, <HI>Who∣se is wise, will oserve these Things.</HI> And the French Version very Expressively intimates the <HI>Design,</HI> as well as the <HI>Event</HI> of this <HI>Observation; That so they may consider the Favours of the Lord.</HI> No Less than Ten years have Rolled away, since we have been plunged into the Distresses of a WAR, with a Barbarous Enemy. In this WAR, we have seen the <HI>Fruitful Land</HI> of almost one whole Province, and another whole County <HI>turned into Barrenness;</HI> doubtless, not without provocations of <HI>Wickedness in them, who dwelt therein;</HI> Men had <HI>Sown Fields</HI> there along the Shore in Settle∣ments for an Hundred miles together, and had <HI>Multiplied Greatly</HI> into a Cluster of <HI>Towns</HI> (be∣sides Lesser <HI>Villages,</HI>) that might Challenge the Name of a, <HI>Decapolis;</HI> but in this WAR, we have seen them <HI>Diminished again and brought Low, through Oppression, Affliction, and Sorrow.</HI> I am to Lead you this day thro' a Spacious Country, which has been on many Accounts, the most Charming part of <HI>New-England;</HI> and I must herewithal say, <HI>Come, Behold the works of the Lord, what Desolations He has made in that Land.</HI> Syrs, 'Tis time for us, to <HI>Observe these Things;</HI> and this, not with a meer <HI>Athenian,</HI> but with a more <HI>profitable</HI> Observation. I must not be Discouraged from this Holy Service, by the vain Scoffs of those that <HI>Blaspheme</HI> all Attempts to <HI>Consider the Wondrous Works of God,</HI> as if it
<PB N="204" REF="103"/> were nothing but a <HI>Telling of News in the Pulpit.</HI> The Biggest part of the Holy Bible, which is but a Relation of such <HI>Wondrous Works,</HI> would be Scoffed by such profane men, if they might not thereby become Obnoxius. No: If <HI>Whoso is wise, will observe these things;</HI> Then let no man call it Folly to make the <HI>Observation.</HI> A Long WAR, is the <HI>Text,</HI> which I am now to insist upon: And, if we would approve our selves <HI>Wise,</HI> after all the <HI>Stripes,</HI> that have in this WAR been given us, these things will occur to our <HI>Observation</HI> in it.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P><HI>I.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is Wise, may observe</HI> the Consequence of Entertaining the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Obtaining and Mentaining the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of that Glorious Gospel. The <HI>Gada∣rens</HI> of old, were loath to have any thing of CHRIST in their <HI>Coast:</HI> And anon comes a <HI>Roman War</HI> which distress'd all the Land: But the woful Town of <HI>Gadara</HI> was the very first place besieged in that <HI>War,</HI> and Sad Things were done unto it. Alas, How little of an <HI>Evangeli∣cal Church-State,</HI> was there to be seen among all our <HI>Eastern Settlements!</HI> It hath been for the want of this, that the Judgments of God, have more than once forbidden them to be called <HI>Settlements.</HI> The Towns were generally with∣out <HI>Preachers</HI> of CHRIST, and much more ge∣nerally
<PB N="205" REF="103"/> without <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST, for to Irradiate 'em: Yea, not one of the Towns, that are utterly broken up, had any <HI>Minister</HI> in it, for a long while before their Final Darkness came upon them. Such a <HI>Way of Living</HI> did content many of them, that it were horrible to Tell, what Ignorance of CHRIST they were thereby sunk into. I would never have told you, That some young men, twenty years old, in this Land, never so much as <HI>once</HI> heard the Name of CHRIST, in all their Lives, if I did not think, that the God of Heaven required us, all to mourn before Him, for such an <HI>Horrible Thing in the Land.</HI> Indeed the Strange Disast∣ers which attended the First Essayes, to Settle that Good Country, made many people, Ima∣gine the <HI>Indian Sorcerers</HI> had Enchanted the Ground so that no English could Thrive on such an Enchanted Soyl. But had they carried the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ with them, doubtless they had confuted that vain Imagina∣tion; all the <HI>Spells</HI> of Hell would have been insignificant; there would not have prevailed any <HI>Enchantment</HI> against a <HI>Gods-Spel</HI> which we have in our <HI>Gospel.</HI> The <HI>Original Design</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND, was to Settle <HI>Congregations,</HI> wherein the Lord Jesus Christ, should be known and serv'd according to His <HI>Gospel;</HI> and Instruct <HI>Families,</HI> that should be the Nurseries of those Congregations. The Plantations of the East,
<PB N="206" REF="104"/> had little of this <HI>Illustrious Design</HI> in their Eye; The Enjoyments of <HI>Gadarens</HI> did seem too much to Satisfy too many of them. <HI>For This cause,</HI> we may Believe it is, that our Lord JESUS CHRIST looking down from Heaven upon these <HI>Unchristi∣an Undertakings,</HI> Thunder-struck them with His Indignation: <HI>He saw the Foolish taking Root, but suddenly He Cursed their Habitation.</HI> When some of our <HI>Eastern People</HI> have been Pining away un∣der the Fatigues of their <HI>Captivity</HI> among the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> who had Stript them of all they had, <HI>Then</HI> they cryed out, <HI>Now, Now the Lord is punishing of us, for our Leaving of His Ordinances, and removing to a place of no Gospel for larger Accommodations in the World, and Exposing our Children to be bred up like the very Indians, into whose Hands we are fallen!</HI> That which Invites one to think, it may be <HI>For this Cause,</HI> is the Singular <HI>Distinction</HI> and <HI>Protection,</HI> which the CHURCHES of our Lord, have Enjoyed, throughout the whole progress of our Calamity. No places that have had CHURCHES gathered in them, have all this while been broken up, however some of them have had much <HI>Bread of Adversity, and Water of Affliction.</HI> The Enemy that have come in upon our Land <HI>Like a Flood,</HI> carried all before them as an <HI>Irresistible Torrent,</HI> until they came to places that have CHURCHES as it were to <HI>Garrison</HI> them. There the Almighty Lord hath check'd the <HI>Proud Waves,</HI> and said, <HI>Hitherto ye shall come,
<PB N="207" REF="104"/> and no further!</HI> But here let me add a very ob∣servable Thing: The Lord had some of His <HI>Elect</HI> among our <HI>Eastern People;</HI> but He ha's brought those <HI>Elect Home</HI> unto Himself, by burn∣ing them out of their <HI>Homes</HI> and Habitations. The <HI>Indians</HI> have driven 'em hither, and here they have met with the Gospel of Christ, and been effectually Called unto the Lord, and Joyn∣ed unto our Churches, and Blessed the Name of God for bringing them unto these Churches. <HI>Periissent nisi Periissent!</HI> Now, <HI>Whoso is Wise, and will observe these things,</HI> cannot but wish, That the <HI>Folly</HI> of Erecting Plantations, without the worship of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, may be no more committed among us. It was whole∣some Counsil, Given, and usually Taken, in the Beginning of <HI>New-England;</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">Let Christians no where sit down without Good Ministers, but let them rather tarry where they are, as <HI>Ezra</HI> tarryed by the River <HI>Ahava,</HI> till he had got some <HI>Levites</HI> to go with them.</Q> And it was even Then observed, That places which made Begin∣nings any long while without Ministers, were with miserable <HI>Unsettlements</HI> broken all to pieces. I sup∣pose, our Eastern Country, will shortly again be peopled: But let the people which intend there to Settle themselves, in the Fear of God Remem∣ber this Admonition; Don't venture to form <HI>Towns</HI> without the <HI>Gospel</HI> in them any more. If the Lamentable Experience which you have
<PB N="208" REF="105"/> more than once had, of a Blast from Heaven upon Enterprizes to Live without the Gospel of the Son of God, will not inspire you with more of Wisdom for the future, I will foretel your Fate, in those awful words, Psal. 28.5. <HI>Because they regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the O∣peration of His Hands, He shall destroy them, and not Build them up.</HI> Yea, But let all <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> at the same Time Learn, what the Wel∣fare of the Ruine, of all, will Turn upon. The whole World was made for our <HI>Lord-Messiah,</HI> and the <HI>Curse</HI> of God will more or less plague the World, according to the Re∣spects, which that <HI>Second Adam,</HI> our <HI>Lord Mes∣siah</HI> finds in it. But <HI>New-England,</HI> is by a more Eminent Profession that <HI>Immanuels Land,</HI> Let the Interests of the Christian Religion in <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> be pursued and preserved among us; Then, <HI>All will go well!</HI> Our Ac∣knowledgment of our Lord JESUS CHRIST in CHURCHES, that shall be so ordered, as to Represent Him, and His Kingdom, unto the World; This will be our <HI>Glory;</HI> and this <HI>Glory</HI> will be our <HI>Defence;</HI> or, as 'tis promised, in Isa. 4.5. <HI>Upon all the Glory shall be a Defence.</HI> But if once the <HI>Spirit of this World,</HI> Eat out the Spirit and Power of Religion, and the Order of our <HI>Churches,</HI> and mens value for a Room in the <HI>Churches,</HI> be lost, Then, write, <HI>Ichabod,</HI> up∣on all our <HI>Glory;</HI> and let us expect, that our
<PB N="209" REF="105"/> Holy Lord will <HI>Spue us out of His Mouth.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<P><HI>II.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us <HI>who∣so is wise, may observe,</HI> in the very <HI>Instruments</HI> of our Calamity, shrow'd Intimations of the <HI>provo∣king Evils,</HI> for which the Righteous God hath Chastised us, by such <HI>Instruments.</HI></P>
<P>When the Miseries of the <HI>Sword</HI> are inflicted on a people, it becomes them to consider what <HI>Provocations</HI> they have given to the Almighty God, who <HI>makes peace, and creates Evil; for 'tis He, the Lord, who doth all these things.</HI> The <HI>Sword</HI> by which we have been so grievously harassed, hath been in the Hands of God: and if our Father had not been very Angry, would He have taken a <HI>Sword</HI> into His Hands? We are Blind before Lightning, we are Deaf unto Thunder, if we do not sensibly perceive the <HI>Anger</HI> of God, in the Tremendous Rebukes that we have suffered: And we are unaccountably, and inexcusably stupid, if we do not Enquire, <HI>What means the Heat of this Anger?</HI> It was once the Commirration of God, in Ezek. 7.24, 27. <HI>I will bring the worst of the Heathen, and they shall possess their Houses, and the Hands of the people of the Land shall be Troubled:</HI> Such <HI>Trouble</HI> hath come upon us, from the <HI>worst of the Heathen!</HI> But what was the cause of all? It follows, <HI>I will do unto them after their way, and I will judge them according to their Deserts, and they shall know that
<PB N="210" REF="106"/> I am the Lord.</HI> It is but seasonable for us now to Look back upon our own <HI>way,</HI> and see how much we have <HI>Deserved</HI> all this Vengeance, by going out of the <HI>way.</HI> Two persons in their Travels beholding the horrid Ruines of <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> one of them said, <HI>Hic fuit Hostilitas;</HI> Behold the Fruit of <HI>Hostility!</HI> his Friend answered, <HI>Hic fuit Iniquitas;</HI> Behold the Fruit of <HI>Iniquity!</HI> If you will Travel over our <HI>East Countrey,</HI> how fre∣quent, how dismal occasions will you see, to Sigh, <HI>See what has been done by Hostility!</HI> But there will be as many occasions for a sadder Sigh than that; Namely, <HI>See the sad Effects of Iniquity!</HI> Now, in this Contemplation, I do not go to charge them that were once Inhabitants of the Now Ruined Plantations, with any <HI>Sins,</HI> but what are more or less to be found in all our Colonies. I ask no more from our Bre∣thren who yet Survive the Desolations that have come upon their Estates and Neighbours in those Plantations, but that they join with the rest of us all, in <HI>Searching and Trying of our ways,</HI> and in <HI>Judging of our selves.</HI> For, alas, <HI>Every mouth must be stop'd, and all the Land is become Guilty before God!</HI> Let us all then <HI>Enquire,</HI> What may have been those <HI>provoking Evils,</HI> for which the <HI>Holy and Blessed God,</HI> hath given the <HI>Sword</HI> a Commission so dreadfully to devour us? But then, Let us be sure <HI>to Enquire wisely concerning that matter.</HI> And here, I will not <HI>Enquire,</HI> whe∣ther
<PB N="211" REF="106"/> those that went before us, might never be too forward in any <HI>Unjustifyable Encroachments,</HI> to possess and command those Lands, which have since proved so Expensive unto us? <HI>Older men</HI> then I, are best able to manage that <HI>Enqui∣ry,</HI> though I also have heard it made. But that whereupon I rather bespeak your Thoughts, is This: Will you please to <HI>Enquire</HI> into the <HI>Pro∣perties</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> of our <HI>Adversaries?</HI> 'Tis possible, that in their <HI>Properties</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> we may read something of those <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> for which our God, hath Raised them up to be our Adversaries. It hath been commonly seen, That when the people of God have sinfully come to <HI>Imitate</HI> the <HI>Evil manners</HI> of <HI>other Nations,</HI> God hath made <HI>those</HI> very Nations to be a so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e scourge unto them. And the sense of This was that which long ago caused many sensible persons, to foretel, which of the <HI>Neighbour Nations,</HI> would bring our dear <HI>England</HI> Low. Now, since the INDIANS have been made by our God. <HI>The Rod of His Anger,</HI> 'tis proper for us to <HI>Enquire,</HI> whether we have not in some Instances too far Imitated the <HI>evil manners</HI> of the <HI>Indians?</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> are Infamous especially for Three Scan∣dalous Vices. First, They are <HI>Lyars</HI> of the first magnitude; One cannot believe a word they speak. Secondly, They are <HI>Sluggards</HI> to a proverb; they are for any way of Living rather than work. Thirdly, They are abominably
<PB N="212" REF="107"/> Indulgent unto their <HI>Children;</HI> there is no <HI>Fami∣ly Government</HI> among them. Will you now <HI>En∣quire,</HI> Sirs, how far we have <HI>Indianized</HI> in every one, but especially, the last of these <HI>Evil Manners?</HI> If we find these <HI>Indian-Vices</HI> to grow Epidemical among us, Oh! don't wonder, that our God hath been with <HI>Indian Hatchets</HI> cutting down the <HI>Tree,</HI> that brings forth <HI>Fruits</HI> thus disagreeable to Him that Planted it.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Whoso is wise, will Observe these things.</HI> And yet the <HI>Observation</HI> may Extend it self a little further. Sometimes, the Soveraign God chooses a Nation Remarkably laudable, for some <HI>Good Thing,</HI> to punish His own people, for the want of that Thing. Thus, when the <HI>Christian Churches</HI> fell into <HI>Idolatry,</HI> God sent the <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI> upon them, to <HI>Torment</HI> them with one <HI>Wo</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter another horribly; and the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are very Remarkable for this, That they are Great Haters of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and wherever they come, they destroy those <HI>Idols, and works of mens Hands,</HI> which are Adored in the <HI>Antichristian Apostacy.</HI> Well, But can any <HI>Good Thing</HI> be reported of our <HI>Indian</HI> Invaders? Yes, there is one <HI>Good Thing</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> have taught them; There is <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> among them, a daily <HI>Family-Worship</HI> upheld among them. I <HI>Fear, I Fear,</HI> this is more than can be said of many <HI>English</HI> Suffe∣rers, that have been annoy'd by those <HI>Indian</HI>-In∣vaders. It may be, the Wretched <HI>Indians</HI> have
<PB N="213" REF="107"/> cut off multitudes of <HI>Families,</HI> to whom they might have said, <HI>These Families never Pray'd unto God once in a Month, and we have done it eve∣ry Day!</HI> And many of our poor Folks, never heard any <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> in their Lives, till they were drag'd into the forlorn and howling <HI>Wig∣wams,</HI> of those wretched <HI>Salvages.</HI> I have hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it said, That in a Town or it may be more than <HI>Seventy Families,</HI> there have not been <HI>Twice Se∣ven Families,</HI> that have had any constant Invoca∣tion of God in them. If it be so, then hear the Voice of God in it, when He sent those Mon∣strous and Furious Barbarians, to burn down such <HI>Prayerless Houses:</HI> The Voice of Heaven in it, is, <HI>If Indians Will pray in their Families more than English, then let Indians destroy those English Fami∣lies.</HI> It was once the direful Imprecation, in Jer. 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy Great Wrath upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</HI> Truly, God ha's used a Sort of <HI>Heathen,</HI> to <HI>Pour out His Great Wrath upon Fa∣milies,</HI> which in this one point, were worse than those <HI>Heathen,</HI> that they <HI>did not call on His Name.</HI> For Gods Sake, be so <HI>Wise</HI> as to <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and let <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> be no where neg∣lected throughout the Land, lest while God is punishing us by the <HI>Pagans,</HI> we become worse than <HI>Pagans.</HI> Let me faithfully and solemnly ad∣vise you, Sirs; A <HI>Prayerless Family</HI> is a <HI>Pagan Family.</HI> Do not now imagine, That it is only

<P><HI>III.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whose is Wise, may observe,</HI> That the very <HI>Objects,</HI> of our <HI>Sins,</HI> have been made the very <HI>Engines</HI> of our <HI>Plagues.</HI> It is a thing <HI>Extraordinarily Observa∣ble,</HI> though it ordinarily happens; That, <HI>In quo quis peccat, in eo punitur;</HI> Men are <HI>Plagu'd</HI> by those very Things, with which they have <HI>Sinn'd.</HI> If an <HI>Eli</HI> omit his Duty towards his <HI>Children,</HI> it follows, in 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.33.

I must freely tell you, I Think, we are, The old <HI>Britons,</HI> did not what they should have done, to Convert the <HI>Saxons</HI> unto Christianity; and when the <HI>Britons</HI> were afterwards fearfully Destroy'd by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> their famous Countrey∣man <HI>Gildas</HI> told them, <HI>This is the Vengeance of God upon you, because you did no more, for the Con∣version of those Miserable Heathen.</HI> And I admire, that the <HI>English</HI> Protestants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after such Massacres from the <HI>Irish Papists,</HI> do no more Effectually make this Reflection.

<PB N="218" REF="110"/> of men among us. We will a little particula∣rize 'em. And first of all, You that are our Honoured <HI>Shepherds;</HI> Will you <HI>Observe</HI> how many of our <HI>Shepherds</HI> have been worried unto Death, by the <HI>Scythian Wolves</HI> of our Wilder∣ness? Two of our MAGISTRATES, have been Treacherously and Barbarously Killed by the <HI>Indian Murderers:</HI> They whom God En∣trusted with the <HI>Sword of Justice</HI> have had their Lives taken away by the <HI>Sword of the Wicked.</HI> I perswade my self, that the rest will be so wise as to <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and <HI>Observe</HI> how to answer the just Expectation of God, in their Administrations. After this, Oh! Why should not our <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> with more zeal than ever set themselves to ponder, <HI>How may I most Glorify God, and Christ,, and Serve his dear people with my Opportunities!</HI></P>
<P>Two of our MINISTERS, have been <HI>Struck down</HI> into the Earth by the <HI>Indian Dragons.</HI> They that have used nothing but the <HI>Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</HI> for the Sa∣ving of all about them, have had the <HI>Destroyers coming upon them,</HI> and have been <HI>Waited for of the Sword.</HI> I assure my self, that the rest will be so <HI>wise,</HI> as to <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and <HI>Observe</HI> how to fulfil our Ministry, with a very Excited Watchfulness. May all our <HI>Settled Pastors,</HI> upon such a thing befalling our Brethren, Resolve with themselves; <HI>Am unworthy I spared? I will
<PB N="219" REF="110"/> do more for my Lord, and more for my Flock, and more for all the Churches, than ever I did.</HI></P>
<P>We will pass on, There have been some <HI>Rich men,</HI> that were finely Scituated, and <HI>had all things Richly to Enjoy:</HI> But this <HI>War</HI> has reduced them to such Necessity, that within Less than One year, they have come to <HI>Beg their Bread:</HI> All their <HI>Treasures</HI> have been <HI>Treasures of Snow;</HI> One Summer has melted all away to Nothing.

Have not we seen almost such Vicissitudes? <HI>Rich men,</HI> If you are <HI>Wise,</HI> (which the <HI>Rich</HI> are <HI>not alwayes!</HI>) You will <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and upon the <HI>Observation</HI> say, <HI>Well, What man in his Right Wits, will now set his Heart upon such Transitory, as all Sublunary Vanities! Oh! my Soul, Do thou make sure of a Better and a Last∣ing Substance in Heaven; for Earthly Riches, take themselves Wing, and flee away towards Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Again, There have been abundance of <HI>Poor men,</HI> who have been by this <HI>War</HI> plunged still into deeper <HI>Poverty:</HI> They have gone without a <HI>Bit of Bread,</HI> for many dayes toge∣ther

You will <HI>Observe these things,</HI> and upon the <HI>Observation,</HI> says: <HI>Well, I had need make sure that my Soul may not be Starved by wanting the Bread of Life, and that my Soul may not be Na∣ked without the Garments of Righteousness; How dolefully am I circumstanced, if I go down from one Hell unto another at the Last!</HI></P>
<P>Once more; How many <HI>Women</HI> have been made a <HI>prey</HI> to those <HI>Bruitish men,</HI> that are <HI>Skil∣ful to Destroy?</HI> How many a <HI>Fearful Thing</HI> has been suffered by the <HI>Fearful Sex,</HI> from those <HI>men,</HI> that one would <HI>Fear,</HI> as <HI>Devils</HI> rather than men?

<PB N="221" REF="111"/> to abuse 'em at their pleasure a thousand inex∣pressible ways; and, if they had any of their <HI>Sucking Infants</HI> with them, then to see those Tender Infants handled at such a rate, that they should beg of the <HI>Tygres,</HI> to dispatch 'em out of hand. Such things as these, I tell you, have often happened in this Lamentable <HI>War.</HI> And now, O ye Handmaids of the Lord; will you not be so <HI>wise,</HI> as to <HI>Observe these things?</HI> But upon the <HI>Observation,</HI> say, <HI>Well, I will Bless God, for my Enjoyments; my Afflictions, be they never so many, are not such as my Neighbours have seen: My Enjoyments are more than my Afflictions. But, Oh! Let me Love and Serve the Good God, that has distinguished me with His Mercies.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be added; We have had our <HI>Old men</HI> whose <HI>Gray Hairs have not come down to the Grave in peace.

<P>But our <HI>Young men</HI> are they whom the Fury of <HI>War,</HI> hath been chiefly poured out upon Alas, Alas, for our <HI>Young men!</HI> They are the
<PB N="222" REF="112"/> persons, with whom, it seems to have been the very Errand of this <HI>War,</HI> to manage the terrible Controversy of God. <HI>New-England</HI> sets a pe∣culiar Accent of Grief upon this, among all her Lamentations; <HI>The Lord has trodden under foot my mighty men in the midst of me, He hath called an Assembly against me, to crush my young men.</HI> Come then, My <HI>Young men;</HI> Be so <HI>Wise,</HI> as to <HI>Observe</HI> these things; and upon the <HI>Observation,</HI> say, <HI>Lord, Let not me, and the rest of my Generation, continue among the Generation of thy Wrath.</HI> Yea, to have done; <HI>Children</HI> also have not been Ex∣cused from a snare in the Blows of this hideous <HI>War.</HI> Little <HI>Boyes</HI> and <HI>Girls,</HI> even these Little <HI>Chickens,</HI> have been Siezed by the <HI>Indian</HI> Vul∣tures.

<P>A Great King of <HI>Persia,</HI> having by Death lost the nearest Relation he had in the world, and being too passionate a Mourner for his Loss, an Ingenious man undertook, to Raise the Dead Relation, unto Life again, if the King would but furnish him in one point, that he apprehended necessary; It was demanded, <HI>What that was?</HI> and it was replied, <HI>Furnish me but with the Names of Three persons, who have never met with any Sadness and Sorrow, and by Writing those Names on the Monument of the Dead, I'l bring the Dead per∣son to Life.</HI> Truly, The <HI>Ten Years</HI> of our <HI>War</HI> have set many <HI>Ten Hundreds</HI> of persons a Mour∣ning over their <HI>Dead Friends;</HI> we have seen e∣very where, <HI>The Mourners go about the Streets:</HI> Now, I durst make you this offer; that if you can find <HI>Three persons,</HI> who have met with no matter of <HI>Sadness</HI> and <HI>Sorrow</HI> in these <HI>Ten Years,</HI> with the Names of them, we'l fetch your <HI>Dead, Friends</HI> to Life again.

<PB N="229" REF="115"/> and again upon us; wherein the <HI>Angels of Death,</HI> have Shot the <HI>Arrows of Death,</HI> into such as could not be reached by the <HI>Bullets</HI> of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ene∣my. This one Town, did in one year, loose, I suppose, at least Six or Seven Hundred of its People, by one contagious Mortality. And tho' of about Three and Twenty Hundred men, that we Employ'd in one Action, we did, in that Action, loose hardly Thirty men, yet how many Hundreds did afterwards miserably perish?</P>
<P>Again; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That the <HI>Harvest,</HI> hath once and again grievously failed in these years; and we have been <HI>Struck thro' with the Terrible Famine,</HI> almost as much as if the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy had been all the while Skulking about our Fields. The very <HI>Course of Nature</HI> hath been altered among us; A Lamentable cry for, <HI>Bread, Bread!</HI> hath been heard in our Streets: The Towns that formerly Supplyed other places with <HI>Grain,</HI> had now been <HI>Famished,</HI> if other places had not sent in a Supply to Them, and had a black prospect of being Famished, notwithstanding that Supply.</P>
<P>Once more; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That the <HI>Sea</HI> hath in these years been Swallowing up our <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and their <HI>Estates,</HI> far more than the <HI>Sword of the Wilderness.</HI> Alas, The Devouring Displeasure of God, hath said concerning us, <HI>Though they go to hide themselves from my Sight afar
<PB N="230" REF="116"/> off upon the Sea, Thence will I command the Serpent, and he shall bite them.</HI> And here, hath it been <HI>Enough,</HI> that our Vessels, enough to make an huge Fleet, have been taken by the <HI>French Ene∣my?</HI> A certain Writer hath computed it, That in only the First Two or Three years of the <HI>War,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Nation lost unto the <HI>French,</HI> more than Fifteen Millions of Pounds Sterling. But no part of the <HI>English</HI> Nation hath been more frequently or sensibly prey'd upon, by the <HI>French,</HI> than what hath gone out of <HI>New England,</HI> ever since the <HI>War</HI> began. I say, Ha's this been <HI>Enough?</HI> No, The wrath of God said, <HI>This is not Enough!</HI> I appeal to you, that have been <HI>Owners</HI> of Vessels, or <HI>Sailors</HI> in them, whether horrible <HI>Shipwracks</HI> have not been multiplied since the <HI>War</HI> began, very much more than ever they were before? <HI>Ah, Lord!</HI> How many of us, have Shed <HI>Rivers of Tears,</HI> over our dear Friends that have been <HI>Buried in the Ocean!</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; You may <HI>Observe,</HI> That in these years, those very Things which were intended for our <HI>Defence,</HI> have oftentimes been so much Improved for our <HI>Damage,</HI> that it was hard for us to say, which was the Greater, the <HI>Defence,</HI> or the <HI>Damage,</HI> which we had from them. It was a Lamen∣table Time with the <HI>Jewes,</HI> when that <HI>Curse</HI> came upon them, <HI>That which should have been for their Wel∣fare, Let it become a Trap, &amp; pour out thine Indignation upon them.</HI> Truly, The <HI>Indignation</HI> of God hath been <HI>poured out</HI> upon us, in this Fruit of the <HI>Curse,</HI> no
<PB N="231" REF="116"/> less frequently then sensibly, that some things which should have been <HI>for our Welfare,</HI> have at the same time, served also to <HI>Entrap</HI> the <HI>Persons,</HI> and <HI>Interests</HI> of many people, into sore Incon∣veniencies. There is no need of Explaining this Article; They that have been under this <HI>Indig∣nation</HI> of God, know the Explaining of it!</P>
<P>Finally, You may <HI>Observe,</HI> What <HI>Untimely Ends,</HI> and what <HI>Surprizing Fates,</HI> have come up∣on our <HI>Sons,</HI> in these <HI>Years of the Wrath of the Right-Hand of the Most High.</HI> When <HI>Craesus</HI> was in <HI>War</HI> taken by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> this Captive made unto the Conqueror, this Remark upon the Diffe∣rence between <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War; O Syr, I see, that in a time of Peace, the Sons Bury their Fathers, but in a Time of War, the Fathers Bury their Sons,</HI> Truly, Sirs, our Time of <HI>War</HI> has in <HI>Various Wayes</HI> of Morta∣lity, been Embittered with this Remark, <HI>The Fa∣thers have been Burying their Sons, all the Countrey over!</HI> Many of us, have had our <HI>Sons,</HI> even those very <HI>Sons,</HI> of whom we said, <HI>This same shall Comfort us!</HI> We have had them violently snatch'd away from us, and Cropt in the very Flower of their <HI>Youth;</HI> and they have Left us deploring, <HI>Oh, my Son, with all my Heart could I have Dy∣ed for thee, my Son, my Son!</HI> But in the midst of these Deplorable Things, God hath given up several of our Sons, into the Hands of the Fierce <HI>Monsters</HI> of <HI>Africa. Mahometan</HI> Turks and Moors, and Devils, are at this Day oppressing many of
<PB N="232" REF="117"/> our Sons, with a <HI>Slavery,</HI> wherein they <HI>Wish for Death, and cannot find it;</HI> a <HI>Slavery,</HI> from whence they cry and write unto us, <HI>It had been Good for us, that we had never been Born.</HI></P>
<Q><L>—Quis talia fando</L>
<L>Temperet a Lacrymis?—</L></Q>
<P>Thus, as <HI>Job</HI> sometimes complained, Chap. 10.17. <HI>Thou Renewest thy Witnesses against me, and increasest thine Indignation upon me; Changes and War are against me:</HI> Thus, in our Long <HI>War,</HI> we have seen those <HI>Changes</HI> on all Hands, and in all Kinds, which have <HI>witnessed</HI> against us, the Dreadful <HI>Indignation</HI> of God. God Threatned His people, (so I read it,) Amos 2.13. <HI>Behold, I will press your place as a full Cart presses the Sheaf:</HI> ['Tis an Allusion to the old way of Threshing the <HI>Corn,</HI> by drawing a Loaden <HI>Cart</HI> with <HI>Wheels,</HI> over the <HI>Corn.</HI> 9. <HI>d.</HI> You shall undergo <HI>Tribula∣tion.</HI>] Ah, <HI>New-England,</HI> Thou hast been under such a <HI>Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>Syrs, Have you not <HI>Observed</HI> these things? But you must <HI>wisely Observe</HI> them. And a <HI>wise Observation</HI> of these things, will cause you to see, <HI>That the War which hath been upon us, hath been a War of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> have been but a small part of those <HI>Armies,</HI> which the Great GOD, hath been bringing out against us, for <HI>Ten Years</HI> together; and we may conclude,
<PB N="233" REF="117"/> that <HI>all the Land</HI> have been more or less con∣cerned in those Crimes, for which the Almighty GOD, hath been with these <HI>Armies</HI> managing His Controvesy with us: Our Confession must be, <HI>Peccavimus omnes; We have all gone astray!</HI> But shall we not upon this <HI>Observation,</HI> take up some <HI>Resolution?</HI> If we are <HI>Wise,</HI> we fhall thus <HI>Resolve; 'Tis Time, 'Tis Time, 'Tis High-Time for us, to make our Peaee with God, Oh, Let us not go on to Harden our selves against God; we are not Stronger than He: But let us all Fly to the Lord Jesus Corist, who is our Peace, and so lay down the Arms of Rebellion, that God may be Reconciled unto us.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<P><HI>VII.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is wise, may Observe</HI> those <HI>Dispensations</HI> of Heaven towards us, that have carryed more than Ordinary <HI>Humiliations</HI> in them. It was said con∣cerning <HI>Miriam,</HI> (the Type of the Now Leprous and out-cast Church of <HI>Israel; The Lord hasten that Seventh Day, wherein it shall be Restored!</HI>) Numb. 12.14. <HI>If her Father had Spit in her Face, should she not be Ashamed?</HI> Ah <HI>New England,</HI> Thy <HI>Father</HI> hath been <HI>Spitting in thy Face,</HI> with most <HI>Humbling Dispensations;</HI> God hath been bringing of thee <HI>down to Sit in the Dust.</HI> When the <HI>War</HI> commenced, <HI>New-England</HI> might say, <HI>My God will Humble me!</HI></P>
<P>For, First; Shall our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> put a <HI>Rod</HI> into the Hands of base <HI>Indians,</HI> and bid <HI>Them</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="118"/> to Scourge His <HI>Children!</HI> Oh! the <HI>Humiliation</HI> of such Rebellious <HI>Children!</HI> Oh! the <HI>Provocation,</HI> that certainly such <HI>Sons</HI> and such <HI>Daughters</HI> have given Him! It was a very <HI>Humbling</HI> thing, that the Lord Threatned unto His <HI>Provoking Sons &amp; Daughters,</HI> in Deut. 32.21. <HI>I will move them to Jealousy, with those which are not a People; I will provoke them to Anger with a Foolish Nation.</HI> Should a Child of yours be Refractory, and you, Sir, should bid a <HI>Negro</HI> or an <HI>Indian</HI> Slave in your House, <HI>Go, Take that Child, and Scourge him till you fetch Blood of him!</HI> Surely, this would be to <HI>Humble</HI> him <HI>unto the Uttermost.</HI> Thus doth thy God <HI>Humble</HI> thee, O <HI>New-England,</HI> by putting thee over, into the Vile Hands of those which are <HI>not a People, but a Foolish Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Again; <HI>Who</HI> are they, by whose means we are now crying out, <HI>We are Brought very Low?</HI> When the most High God, was determined Effectually to <HI>Humble,</HI> His People, he said, in Jer. 37.10. <HI>Though ye had Smitten the whole Army of the Caldeans, that fight against you, and there re∣mained but wounded men among them, yet should they Rise up every man in his Tent; and burn this City with Fire.</HI> Truly, we had <HI>Smitten the whole Army,</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> that <HI>Fought</HI> against us Three and Twenty years ago, from one end of the Land unto the other; only there were left a few <HI>Wounded men among them</HI> in the East; and now, they have <HI>Risen up every man,</HI> and have set the
<PB N="235" REF="118"/> whole Country on <HI>Fire.</HI> Certainly, A more <HI>Humbling</HI> matter cannot be Related!</P>
<P>Moreover; Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That when about an <HI>Hundred Indians</HI> durst Begin a <HI>War,</HI> upon all these Populous Colonies, an Army of a <HI>Thousand English</HI> raised, must not kill one of them all; but instead thereof, more of our <HI>Souldiers</HI> perish by Sickness and Hardship than we had <HI>Enemies</HI> then in the world? <HI>Our God ha's Humbled us!</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That when the Number of our <HI>Enemies</HI> afterwards Increased, yet an Handful of them should, for so many Summers together continue our <HI>Unconquered Spoilers,</HI> and put us to such Vast Charges, that if we could have Bought them, for <HI>an Hundred Pound an Head,</HI> we should have made a Saving Bargain of it? <HI>Our God ha's Humbled us!</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That we should have had several fair <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to have brought this <HI>War</HI> unto a <HI>Final Period,</HI> but we should still by some <HI>fatal Oversight</HI> let Slip those <HI>Oppor∣tunities? Our God ha's Humbled us.</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humling</HI> Thing, That whatever <HI>Expeditions</HI> we have undertaken, for the most part we have come off <HI>Loosers,</HI> and indeed but plunged our selves into <HI>deeper Straits,</HI> by our <HI>Undertakings? Our God ha's Humbled us!</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That more than One or Two of our <HI>Forts</HI> have been Sur∣rendred,
<PB N="236" REF="119"/> and one of them that was almost Im∣pregnable, given away with a most <HI>Shameful Sur∣render,</HI> by one that hath since Received Some∣thing of what he Deserved? Thus, <HI>Our God ha's Humbled us.</HI></P>
<P>Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That we should have <HI>Evil pursuing of us</HI> at such a rate, that in other Lands afar off, and on the <HI>Exchange</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> Strangers have made this Reflection, <HI>Doubtless,</HI> New-England <HI>is a Countrey in Ill Terms with Heaven?</HI> But so, <HI>Our God has Humbled us.</HI></P>
<P>What shall I say? Is it not a very <HI>Humbling</HI> Thing, That when <HI>Peace</HI> is Restored unto the whole <HI>English Nation,</HI> and when <HI>Peace</HI> is Enjoy'd by all <HI>America,</HI> poor <HI>New-England</HI> should be the <HI>Only Land</HI> still Embroil'd in <HI>War?</HI> But thus, <HI>Our God, Thou hast Humbled us, and shown us great and sore Troubles, and brought us down into the Depths of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>O my dear People; How can I <HI>Observe these Things,</HI> and not like <HI>Joshua</HI> now <HI>fall to the Earth on my Face before the Lord,</HI> and say, <HI>What shall I say?</HI> But if you will <HI>wisely observe these Things,</HI> you will now <HI>get up, and Sanctify your selves,</HI> and <HI>put away the accursed thing from among you,</HI> O New-English <HI>Israel!</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, The <HI>High and Lofty One,</HI> who <HI>dwells in the High and Holy place,</HI> Expects that we should be a very <HI>Humbled People.</HI> I beseech you, Sirs, <HI>Observing these Things,</HI> let us in all the Methods
<PB N="237" REF="119"/> of Repentance <HI>Humble our selves under the Mighty Hand of God.</HI> After such <HI>Humbling</HI> Things, as have befallen us, God forbid, that it should be said of us, as in Jer. 44.10. <HI>They are not Humbled, even unto this Day!</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="part">
<P><HI>VIII.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is Wise, may Observe</HI> the <HI>Compassions</HI> of God, wonderfully Exercised, and Manifested, and Magnified, in the midst of our <HI>Confusions.</HI> There was a Time, when a <HI>Bush Burned with Fire, and yet the Bush was not consumed:</HI> whereupon said <HI>Moses,</HI> in Exod. 3.3. <HI>I will now Turn aside and see this Great Sight!</HI> Sirs, I am now to call upon you, <HI>O Turn aside, and see such a Great Sight as that!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, in the midst of all our <HI>Lamentations,</HI> we must own, with the Church, in Lam. 3:22. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercies, that we are not Consumed, because His Compassions fail not.</HI> But there are ma∣ny Particular and Astonishing <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Mercy,</HI> which we have seen in this Tedious <HI>War.</HI> Sirs, Come now to <HI>Observe</HI> some of those Things, with prepared <HI>Hallelujahs!</HI></P>
<P>It was the Petition, in Hab. 3.2. <HI>O Lord, In Wrath Remember Mercy. New England,</HI> Thy God hath heard this Petition for thee, in very wonderful Instances!</P>
<P>For, First, After a very Amazing manner ha's <HI>Mercy</HI> been <HI>Remembred</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="120"/> when we have been Rescued by the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, at the very point of our being else Ruined by <HI>His Wrath.</HI> Lord, <HI>Thou hast shewed thy People hard Things, and made us Drink the Wine of Asto∣nishment.</HI> But our <HI>Extremity</HI> hath been Gods <HI>Opportunity,</HI> to Relieve us. Several Times in the late years of our Affliction, we have been brought unto a dismal <HI>Non-plus</HI> in our Affayrs, and we would scarce imagine it possible for us to subsist any longer. But just <HI>Then!</HI> the Bowels of our Compassionate God have been moved for us; He hath said, <HI>How shall I give thee up, O</HI> New-England? <HI>How shall I give thee up,</HI> O Massachusetts? And so, He would not <HI>Execute upon us the Fierceness of His Anger,</HI> but with some unexpected Succours from the <HI>Machin of Heaven</HI> He hath Relieved us. We have several times been, Like a Little Vessel in a <HI>Storm;</HI> the Swelling Waves have Dashed, &amp; Ra∣ged, and Roared; the Rude Billows have been going over us, and we have been ready to <HI>Sink.</HI> But just <HI>Then!</HI> Our Compassionate Lord Jesus Christ, hath <HI>Awaked</HI> for our Safety, and mar∣vellously calmed our Circumstances. O thou Land, strangely Saved by the Lord, say now, as in Psal. 136.23. <HI>O Give thanks unto the Lord, who Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mer∣cy Endureth for ever.</HI> When our <HI>Debts</HI> have be∣come Insupportable, God has then <HI>Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mercy Endureth
<PB N="239" REF="120"/> for ever,</HI> and strangely Extricated us. When our <HI>Foes</HI> have been as an <HI>Overflowing Scourge,</HI> like to carry all before them, God has then <HI>Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mercy Endureth for ever,</HI> and strangely Lifted up a Standard a∣gainst them. When fearful <HI>Divisions</HI> have arisen among us, and horrid <HI>Convulsions</HI> have been rea∣dy to pull all to pieces,—I don't care to <HI>Remem∣ber</HI> them, any farther than to say, God has then, <HI>Remembred us in our Low Estate, because His Mer∣cy Endureth fer ever,</HI> and strangely healed those <HI>Breaches,</HI> that set the Land a <HI>Trembling.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; It hath been a very <HI>Strange Thing,</HI> and a Wondrous <HI>Remembrance</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath;</HI> That the <HI>Indians</HI> have been <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naccountably Restrained,</HI> from giving us, an Hun∣dredth part of the Trouble, which they might have done, had they but <HI>known,</HI> or <HI>us'd</HI> their own Advantages. This One Thing, Whosoever does <HI>wisely Observe</HI> it, must needs ascribe it unto a Special Operation of that God, who <HI>Forms the Spirit of man within him.</HI> It was the promise of God, unto His people, Exod. 34.24. <HI>No man shall Desire thy Land, when thou shalt go up to ap∣pear before the Lord thy God.</HI> The Faithful God strangely. Fulfilled this promise, for many Hun∣dreds of years together; <HI>No Enemy desired the Land</HI> of that people, at the Time of their going up to Worship the Lord in His Temple. And whereas, the <HI>Roman Enemy,</HI> did at length <HI>Desire
<PB N="240" REF="121"/> their Land,</HI> at the Time of their going up to the <HI>Passover,</HI> this one Thing, was enough to prove, that the <HI>Messiah</HI> was come, and the <HI>Passover</HI> no longer commanded. It shows, That there is a <HI>Strange Operation</HI> of God, upon the <HI>minds</HI> of men, to curb and check, and blind the <HI>Evil-min∣ded.</HI> Well; We have had our <HI>Frontier Towns,</HI> in many of which, the Lord Jesus Christ hath been Worshipped, and Sought, and Serv'd con∣tinually. Had the Lurking <HI>Enemy</HI> done as they might have done, how easily might one dozen of them, have kept the Towns in such perpetu∣al and perplexing <HI>Alarms,</HI> as would have caused them, even to have broken up! And what <HI>un∣known mischiefs</HI> might a few more of 'em, have brought upon our Scattered Plantations! I do again, and again say, This is from the <HI>Strange Operation</HI> of God, upon the <HI>Minds</HI> of the Ene∣my, that they have no more <HI>Disturbed our Land.</HI> For my own part, I will <HI>observe</HI> it, and <HI>Admire</HI> it, in such Terms as <HI>Austin</HI> used upon a Remar∣kable Providence; <HI>Quisquis non videt, Caecus; Quisquis videt, nec Laudat, Ingratus; Quisquis Laudanti reluctatur, Insanus:</HI> They are <HI>Blind,</HI> and <HI>Mad,</HI> that are Insensible of it!</P>
<P>Yet again, Have not our <HI>English Prisoners</HI> been favoured with such a <HI>Remembrance of Mer∣cy,</HI> in the <HI>midst of Wrath,</HI> as ought never to be <HI>Forgotten?</HI> The <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, inclined the <HI>French</HI> to Buy 'em out of the Hands of the
<PB N="241" REF="121"/> <HI>Indians,</HI> and use them with an Exemplary Hu∣manity and Civility. The <HI>Mercy</HI> of God pre∣served many of them alive, under prodigious and incredible Hardships, and at length Return∣ed many scores of them Home. And may not our <HI>English Women,</HI> that were <HI>Prisoners,</HI> take No∣tice of one Singular <HI>Mercy</HI> shown by God unto them, in preserving them from Violations by the <HI>Outrageous Lusts</HI> of the Salvages? This <HI>One Thing</HI> will be thought by some, almost as Great and Strange an Instance of an Immediate Interposition of the <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> as the muzzling of the Lions in the Den of <HI>Daniel! O ye Redeemed of the Lord, you, whom He hath Redeemed from the Hand of the Enemy; Give Thanks, to the Lord, for He is Good?</HI> Charge your own Souls, That you <HI>never forget His Benefits;</HI> Ask your own Souls, What you <HI>shall render to the Lord for all His Benefits:</HI> and <HI>Remember</HI> that Admonition of the Lord Je∣sus Christ unto you, <HI>Sin no more, Lest a worst thing do come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore; Who could not see <HI>Mercy Re∣membred,</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI> when God hath put it into the Hearts of His people in the <HI>Southern</HI> parts of the Countrey, to make <HI>Liberal Contributions</HI> of <HI>Money,</HI> and <HI>Corn,</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> for the Relief of the <HI>Northern</HI> parts? More than once, has the Noble <HI>Charity,</HI> of our Brethren in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> as well as of this
<PB N="242" REF="122"/> Town, been Expressed in such <HI>Contributions.</HI> Their <HI>Alms</HI> are <HI>Gone up for a Memorial before the Lord!</HI> The <HI>Blessing</HI> of many that have been <HI>Ready to perish,</HI> hath come upon you, <HI>O ye Merci∣ful Children of God,</HI> and you shall <HI>obtain mercy</HI> from Him.</P>
<P>Once more: Was ever <HI>Mercy Remembred</HI> in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI> more conspicuously than when powerful <HI>Adversaries</HI> Designing Inroads upon us, have been Diverted wonderfully. Ad∣vice hath been seasonably Dispatched unto us, of the Intentions in our Enemies to fall upon our Frontiers, and this <HI>Advice</HI> hath proved our <HI>Safety.</HI> Yea, sometimes when we have had no <HI>Advice,</HI> a Strange Direction from Heaven has Led us to those Actions, which have as much defeated the Intentions of our Enemies, as if we had Received the fullest <HI>Advice</HI> in the world: Besides this, <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>Salem,</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth</HI> especially: Will they ever forget the <HI>Last year?</HI> It was a <HI>Year of Salvations;</HI> yea, It was a <HI>Year of Miracles!</HI> Never, Never such a <HI>Year</HI> passed o∣ver us. The Almighty show'd that Favour to His people of old, <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.8. <HI>I will Encamp a∣bout my House, because of the Army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that Returneth. Alexander</HI> in an Expedition to the <HI>Southward</HI> did <HI>pass by</HI> the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> and he did <HI>Return</HI> a∣gain to the <HI>Northward,</HI> without Hurting that Land, that had the <HI>House of God</HI> in it. Formida∣ble
<PB N="243" REF="122"/> <HI>French</HI> Squadrons, have more than once <HI>pas∣sed by,</HI> to the <HI>Southward,</HI> and have <HI>Returned</HI> again to the <HI>Northward,</HI> intending doubtless a <HI>Destroy∣ing Visit</HI> into this Land by the way; but Our Lord Jesus Christ hath <HI>Encamped about His House here, because of the Navy.</HI> Yea, once, O <HI>New-England, the Lord thy God,</HI> He that would be the <HI>Holy One of</HI> New-England, gave <HI>Carthagena</HI> for thy <HI>Ransome,</HI> He <HI>gave men for thee, and</HI> Spani∣ards <HI>for thy Life.</HI> Another Time, when a <HI>Force</HI> likely enough to have carried all before them, were almost arrived unto us, we are advised, that God sent such a sudden, and such a wasting <HI>Sickness</HI> among them, as to make them for want of Hands, to desist from their Attempt. These were Illustrious <HI>Deliverances!</HI> And yet give me leave to say, We did the last year, see another <HI>Deliverance,</HI> that for ought I know, may be aequal to any of the rest. There was an <HI>English Fleet</HI> of our Good Friends with a direful Plague a∣board 'em, intending <HI>Hither.</HI> Had they <HI>Come,</HI> as they intended, what an horrible Desolation had cut us off, Let the Desolate places that some of you have seen in the Colonies of the <HI>South,</HI> declare unto us; And that they did <HI>not come,</HI> it was the Signal <HI>Hand of Heaven,</HI> by which the <HI>Goings of men are ordered.</HI></P>
<P>In Fine; Because God, <HI>being full of Compassion,</HI> would not <HI>Stir up all His Wrath,</HI> He hath <HI>Re∣membred Mercy</HI> to us, in the midst of <HI>Wrath,</HI> by
<PB N="244" REF="123"/> Raising us up Generous <HI>Benefactors,</HI> who have been able and willing to oblige us, with their <HI>Benefits.</HI> It must be with shame acknowledged, Our Usage of our <HI>Publick Servants</HI> has common∣ly been such, that for any <HI>Thinking man,</HI> to be willing at all to <HI>Serve</HI> the <HI>Publick,</HI> seems to be a Mark and Fruit of no little <HI>Generosity.</HI> Never∣theless, we have had persons of Exemplary <HI>Pa∣tience,</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> and <HI>Self denial,</HI> Sitting at the <HI>Helm</HI> of our <HI>Government,</HI> all this while that the <HI>Horrible Tempest</HI> hath been enough to make any man living <HI>Sick</HI> of being there. We have had persons, who have Disbursed and Expended of their <HI>Estates,</HI> and considerably Damnified their <HI>Interests</HI> for us, in our Distresses, when yet they foreknew what <HI>pay</HI> they should have after all. Yea, we have had, and still have, [I can at this moment fasten my Eye upon some of them, in the Assembly where I am now speaking,] <HI>Brave men,</HI> who have <HI>Bravely Jeoparded their Lives in the High places of the Field,</HI> for our Defence. O Treat 'em not with <HI>vile Ingrati∣tude,</HI> after all the Service they have done: <HI>Prefer</HI> them on all fit occasions, while they Live, <HI>Embalm</HI> their Memories, and <HI>Requite</HI> their Families, when they are Dead. But while we are Thankful to <HI>Them,</HI> Let us much more give Thanks to <HI>God</HI> for Them, even, for such <HI>Gifts</HI> of Heaven as we have Enjoy∣ed in them.</P>

<P>Well; Will you <HI>Wisely Observe</HI> these Things? <HI>Wisely!</HI> That is to say, <HI>Thankfully,</HI> and <HI>Fruit∣fully.</HI> It may be, If more Distinct and Solemn THANKSGIVINGS, were made unto <HI>God our Saviour,</HI> for these things, the <HI>Reliques</HI> of our Enemies would quickly feel the Rebukes of God upon them; not unlike those, in 2 Chron. 20.22. <HI>When they began to Sing and to Praise, the Lord set Ambushments against</HI> their Enemies, <HI>and they were Smitten.</HI></P>

<P><HI>IX.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is Wise, may Observe</HI> those things, that may Mightily Encourage our <HI>Prayer,</HI> and our <HI>Faith,</HI> for a Total Ruine, to be hastened on the <HI>Re∣mainders</HI> of our <HI>Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>There yet <HI>Remains</HI> a Knot of our Enemies, in those <HI>Inaccessible Thickets,</HI> where we Despair ever to <HI>Find 'em out;</HI> but I will Read their Doom, from Psal. 21.8, 9, 10 <HI>Thine Hand,</HI> O Lord, <HI>shall Find out all thine Enemies, Thy Right Hand shall Find out th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that Hate thee; The Lord shall Swallow them up in His Wrath, and the Fire shall Devour them; Their Fruit shalt thou Destroy from the Earth, and their Seed from among the Children of men.</HI> What <HI>Remains</HI> for <HI>Us,</HI> is, That we do by <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> put our Enemies over, into those Omnipotent <HI>Hands,</HI> that can <HI>Find them out,</HI> and cut them off. Oh! Let us keep our <HI>Hands Lifted up in Prayer,</HI> for a Total Dissipation of
<PB N="246" REF="124"/> those <HI>Amalekites,</HI> which have thus long and thus far prevailed against us! We have already had many Notable <HI>Answers of Prayer,</HI> in this our <HI>War:</HI> Every one of our <HI>Deliverances</HI> have been very No∣tably <HI>Such!</HI> We cannot say, How many particular Persons, have Received <HI>Answers of Prayer,</HI> in the particular Troubles, which this <HI>Evil Time</HI> hath <HI>Ensnared</HI> them withal. Doubtless, many a <HI>Christian,</HI> ha's in this Time, had opportunity to say, <HI>This poor man cryed, and the Lord Heard him, and Saved him out of all his Troubles!</HI> And several Towns, that have had a <HI>Remarkable Protection</HI> of God upon them, in this long Time of <HI>Danger,</HI> they have had a <HI>Praying People</HI> in them, and that <HI>Praying People</HI> have been the <HI>Chariots and the Horse men</HI> thereof. Why else does <HI>Deerfield</HI> Stand? How should our <HI>Prayer</HI> be <HI>Quickened</HI> by such Ex∣periences! But there is this further <HI>Quickening</HI> for it, That with the Cry of our <HI>Prayer,</HI> there will go up unto the Lord, the Cry of <HI>Blood;</HI> much Innocent, &amp; Righteous, &amp; Precious <HI>Blood,</HI> Cryes to Heaven, from the Ground against those <HI>Bloody</HI> and <HI>Crafty</HI> men, that have Treacherously shed it. Certainly, They must not <HI>Live out all their Dayes!</HI> And we have this prevailing plea against them, in the <HI>Court of Heaven!</HI> That they have most Falsely Broken their <HI>Covenants,</HI> in their <HI>Outrages.</HI> We may venture, to present our <HI>Me∣morials,</HI> in the <HI>Court of Heaven,</HI> against these <HI>Co∣venant Breakers,</HI> who are <HI>Implacable and Unmer∣ciful;</HI>
<PB N="247" REF="124"/> and we may use the words of <HI>Jephtah,</HI> against his Heathen Adversaries, <HI>The Lord the Judge, be Judge between us and them!</HI> We may use the words of <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> against his Heathen Adversaries, <HI>O our God, wilt thou not Judge them? Vladislaus,</HI> the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> Scandalously breaking his League, with <HI>Amurath</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperour, brought an Army into the Field a∣gainst him. The <HI>Turkish</HI> Army being horribly Broke, and Slain, and almost Vanquished by the <HI>Hungarian, Amurath</HI> in his Anguish, took out of his Bosome, the written League, that <HI>Vladi slaus</HI> had made with him, and holding it up in his Hands, with his Eyes to Heaven, he Cryed out, <HI>Behold, O Crucified Christ, the League which thy Christians in thy Name have made with me, and now without cause do Violate; If thou be a God, Re∣venge the Wrong that is now done unto thy Name, and shew thy power upon a Perjurious People, who in their Deeds Deny their God!</HI> Immediately the Course of the Battel turn'd; and Perjurious King was kill'd; and the Turks w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a most unex∣pected Victory. Truly we may in like manner now take the Instrument of the <HI>Submission</HI> and <HI>Agreement</HI> of the <HI>Eastern Indians,</HI> which Thirteen of their Chief Commanders did Sign more than Five years ago; and Holding it up to Heaven, we may Cry out, <HI>Ah, Lord God of Truth, wilt thou not be Revenged upon the False Wretches that have broken this League!</HI> Doubtless, our God will
<PB N="248" REF="125"/> Execute a dreadful <HI>Vengeance</HI> upon them, if we Humbly make our Suit unto Him for it; and He ha's wayes for His <HI>Vengeance</HI> to come at them, which <HI>We</HI> cannot Imagine. 'Tis affirm∣ed, That several Times in this <HI>War,</HI> our <HI>Enemies,</HI> have in the Woods met with Parties of <HI>Indians,</HI> which were their <HI>own Friends,</HI> but by a mistake apprehending each to be Enemies unto each o∣ther, they have hotly fallen upon one another, and many have been kill'd oh both Sides before the mistake was discovered. Yea, 'Tis affirmed, that not a few of the Chief <HI>Murderers</HI> among our <HI>Enemies,</HI> have accidentally killed themselves; the most Murderous <HI>Indians,</HI> have in a little while been their own Executioners. Who can tell, what <HI>Strange Wayes,</HI> the God <HI>unto whom Vengeance belongeth,</HI> hath to inflict it, on a Generation of His <HI>Curse?</HI></P>
<P>Only, Let us Remember to plead the <HI>Sacrifice of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, in our <HI>Prayer,</HI> with our <HI>Faith,</HI> for the <HI>Perfection</HI> of our <HI>De∣liverance.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, hath been a <HI>Sin-Offering for the Congregation,</HI> and a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> pleadeable, not only for <HI>Persons,</HI> but also for <HI>Peoples</HI> that belong unto Him. We read in 1 Sam. 7.9, 10. <HI>Samuel Offered a Burnt-Offering wholly unto the Lord, and Samuel Cryed unto the Lord of Israel, and the Lord heard him; and the Lord Thundred with a Great Thunder on that Day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them.</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="125"/> When we Cry to the Lord, Let us plead the <HI>Burnt-Offering</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; plead, That God ha's more Glorifyed His <HI>Justice</HI> in the Sufferings of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, than if our Houses were all Fill'd with the Cryes of our People Massacred by <HI>Indian</HI> Sal∣vages. <HI>Then</HI> will our God <HI>Thunder with a Great Thunder</HI> of His Consuming Wrath upon our <HI>Indian Philistines!</HI> That Note, which the Great <HI>Calvin</HI> ha's above an Hundred Times over, in his Commentaries on the Psalms, <HI>Nunquam Irritas fore preces,</HI> Or, <HI>Prayers will never be lost! Prayers will never he lost!</HI> It will much oftner be Repeated in our Blessed <HI>Experience,</HI> if our <HI>Prayers</HI> do present before God that Blessed <HI>Sa∣crifice,</HI> of which He sayes, <HI>'Tis a Sweet odour to Me!</HI></P>

<P><HI>X.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Whoso is Wise, may Observe</HI> those Loud Calls to a <HI>Reformation</HI> of our <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> which 'tis a Dangerous and a Desperate thing to neglect any longer. It was the Voice of the Blessed God, in Psal. 81.13, 14. <HI>O That my People had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my wayes! I should soon have Subdued their Enemies, and turned my Hand against their Adversaries.</HI> Ah, <HI>New-England;</HI> Thy God hath not <HI>soon Sub∣dued thine Enemies, nor soon turned His Hand against thine Adversaries:</HI> but let 'em Vex thee for <HI>Ten years</HI>
<PB N="250" REF="126"/> together. Surely, Thou hast not <HI>hearkened unto Him,</HI> nor <HI>Walked in His Wayes!</HI> In that which was called, <HI>The Holy War,</HI> the Embassadors of a <HI>Saracen Prince,</HI> demanded of a Famous Christian General, How he came to have, <HI>Manus tam Doctas ad Praeliandum, Hands</HI> that were so Able to <HI>Fight?</HI> The Christian General replied, <HI>Quia Manus Semper habui puras,</HI> Because I never de∣filed my <HI>Hands,</HI> with any <HI>Notorious Wickedness.</HI> Alas, our <HI>Hands</HI> have made but poor work at <HI>Fighting.</HI> 'Tis Time for us, then to <HI>Reform</HI> all the <HI>Notorious Wickedness</HI> in our <HI>Hands!</HI> Do we Dream that the Almighty hath spent all His <HI>Arrows?</HI> No, after, all that for <HI>Ten years</HI> to∣gether have been spent upon, us there are yet more <HI>Arrows,</HI> and <HI>Judgments</HI> left in the Quiver of God: And Except we <HI>Turn</HI> unto Him, who can say, What <HI>Arrows</HI> He may next ordain against us? The Roman Emperour Upbraided his General <HI>Terentius,</HI> for Loosing a Battel; but the General, having too much occasion to say so much, replyed, <HI>Sir, I must tell you, that it is you that Lost the Day for us, by your open Fighting against the God of Heaven as you do.</HI> If it be asked, How 'tis come to pass, that we have Sped so Ill in many a Battel, since this <HI>War</HI> began? Some will blame one, and some will blame another: but I will take Leave to tell all them that Lead an
<PB N="251" REF="126"/> Ungodly Life, <HI>Syrs, 'Tis to you, that we owe all our Ill Success!</HI> I need not quote one of the Ancients, namely, <HI>Ambrose,</HI> for that <HI>Observation, Graviores Inimici sunt mores pravi, quam Hostes Infensi:</HI> We have had enough in our own Ex∣periments to convince us, <HI>That our worst Enemies are our Vices, which provoke Heaven to Chastise us with all our other Enemies:</HI> And indeed, If our <HI>Wayes did please the Lord, our Enemies would be at peace with us. Observe wisely,</HI> and you cannot but <HI>Observe,</HI> the Language of Heaven, in the Circumstances thro' which we have passed for a whole <HI>Decad</HI> of years together, to be That, in Lev. 26.23, 24. <HI>If ye will not be Reformed by me, by these things, but will walk contrary unto me, Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I will punish you yet seven Times for your Sins.</HI> And that the Demand of REFORMATION may be Loud enough, it arrives to us now with a more than Ordinary Accent of <HI>Authority</HI> upon it. We have seen, and, Blessed be God, that we have seen, the Greatest Monarch that ever Sat upon the <HI>British Throne,</HI> Issuing Out His Royal <HI>Proclamation,</HI> upon the Pious Address of the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> assemble in <HI>Par∣liament;</HI> a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> wherein that Illustrious Prince declares His Royal <HI>Resolution</HI> to Discoun∣tenance all <HI>Vice</HI> whatsoever, and requires all <HI>Of∣ficers</HI> whatsoever to be vigilant, in the Discove∣ry, Prosecution, and Punishment thereof. We
<PB N="252" REF="127"/> have seen a most Excellent GOVERNOUR, who is the Greatest Person that ever set Foot on the English Continent of <HI>America,</HI> beginning His Government, with proclaiming for the Sup∣pression of all Vice in One of His Provinces: That Noble Person has therein done, Like a <HI>Vicegerent</HI> of GOD! His very Honourable <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> hath worthily done His part, with the Advice of His <HI>Council,</HI> in another of His Provinces. If these things prove but meer <HI>For∣malities,</HI> among a people, <HI>Hating to be Reformed</HI> after all, what will they be, but more Terrible Prognosticks of Tremendous and Amazing De∣solations at hand, than so many <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> on Fire, in Heaven over us. It is to be hoped, the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, will do what be∣longs to Them, for the Assistence of all <HI>Holy Essayes</HI> about <HI>Reformation;</HI> and their <HI>Churches,</HI> if call'd upon, will join with them, in the Me∣thods of <HI>Covenant,</HI> and of <HI>Discipline,</HI> for the pro∣moting of it. Yea, It is to be Hoped, That we shall all <HI>Zealously</HI> in our several Stations, do all that we can, for the pleasing of God, and for the Correction, and Suppression, and <HI>Refor∣mation</HI> of the Sin that may be displeasing to Him. It is a Thing very notorious unto us, That <HI>Idleness, Drunkenness, Uncleanness, Cheating, Lying, Profane Swearing,</HI> and above all, that which is the <HI>Root</HI> of all, the <HI>Profanation of the
<PB N="253" REF="127"/> Lords-Day,</HI> gains ground upon us. Let all that have any <HI>Power</HI> in their Hands, unto the utmost of their <HI>power,</HI> Endeavour to keep under those Enormities. But <HI>Last</HI> of all, Nay, I should ra∣ther say, <HI>First</HI> of all, O let every man set upon <HI>Self-Reformation,</HI> with all his might! I Remem∣ber, that passage, in Prov. 18.17. <HI>He that is first in his own Cause, seemeth right,</HI> is translated by the <HI>Vulgar Latin,</HI> so as to carry a further, and an useful Admonition in it; <HI>Justus primus est Accusator sui,</HI> A <HI>Just man,</HI> before he meddles with the <HI>Reproof</HI> of others, will <HI>first Accuse</HI> him∣self, and search the State of his own Soul, and Life, and faithfully <HI>Reform</HI> it. Oh! That very much of This might be done among us! How doth an Army of Thrice Ten Thousand men, presently <HI>Turn</HI> from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> because <HI>Every One Turns One?</HI> Syrs, We have <HI>Wisely Observed</HI> the Things that have in our Afflicted years be∣fallen us, and we have now to good purpose heard a Sermon of <HI>Observations</HI> upon those things, if we will now Retire, and ponder seri∣ously with our selves, <HI>What is there amiss, in my own Heart, and in my own Life, and in my own Family and by what Reformation of my self may I best answer the Expectation of the God, who has Cha∣stised us all?</HI></P>
<PB N="254" REF="128"/>
<P>We have been under the <HI>Lamentable Punish∣ments</HI> of our Sins, for two <HI>Lustres</HI> of <HI>years</HI> toge∣ther; 'Tis time for <HI>every man,</HI> and for all of us, as <HI>one man,</HI> to say, as in Lam. 3.40. <HI>Let us Search and Try our Wayes, and Turn again unto the Lord.</HI></P>
