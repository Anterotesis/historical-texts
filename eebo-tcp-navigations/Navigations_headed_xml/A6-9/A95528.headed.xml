<HEAD><HI>The certainty of the uncertaine Travels of</HI> John Taylor, <HI>performed in this yeere</HI> 1653.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TIs laudable to read well pen'd Relations</L>
<L>Of foreign Countries, &amp; their situations,</L>
<L>That by the judgement of the eie &amp; brain</L>
<L>Some knowledge to discourse we may attain.</L>
<L>For Histories, and learn'd Cosmographers,</L>
<L>And diligent acute Geographers;</L>
<L>One hath survay'd celestiall lofty sphears,</L>
<L>How all the Planets run in their carriers:</L>
<L>The stars, the signes, and every influence</L>
<L>In every Heavenly Orbs circumference,</L>
<L>And were it not for high Astronomy</L>
<L>(Whose lofty painfull steps have scal'd the sky)</L>
<L>For times and seasons we might grope and seek,</L>
<L>Not knowing yeers, or quarters, month, or week,</L>
<L>Or houres, or minutes, nor the Sabbath day,</L>
<L>Nor when to eat, or sleep, or debts to pay.</L>
<L>Millions of people would this knowledge lack</L>
<L>Except directed from the Almanack.</L>
<L>Thus Art, (with pains and travell of the mind)</L>
<L>Taught mean capacities, these things to find.</L>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<L>He travels far that goes beyond the Moone,</L>
<L>Or thinks this skill may be attayned soone.</L>
<L>Their overweening thoughts flie high and quick</L>
<L>But such mad fooles are only lunatick.</L>
<L>Geographers have travel'd land and seas</L>
<L>Each coast, and opposite Antipodes;</L>
<L>And the description of all lands and parts</L>
<L>Described are, in severall Maps and Charts.</L>
<L>The Sun &amp; Moon have seldom shewd their faces</L>
<L>On any Empire, Kingdom, place, or places,</L>
<L>Which Travellers have not viewd and survayd,</L>
<L>And by rare Geographique Art displayd.</L>
<L>By either sea or land, by night or day,</L>
<L>Geography hath chalk'd us out the way:</L>
<L>That with Maps, Compas, &amp; indifferent weather</L>
<L>True men or Thieves may travell any whither.</L>
<L>And thus throgh thick &amp; thin, ways hard or soft,</L>
<L>Thousand and thousand miles I travel'd oft.</L>
<L>Some men do travell in their contemplations,</L>
<L>In reading Histories and strange Relations:</L>
<L>Some few do travell in the wayes Divine,</L>
<L>Some wander wildly with the Muses nine;</L>
<L>For every man would be a Poet gladly,</L>
<L>Although he write and Rime but badly madly.</L>
<L>Sometimes the wits and tongues do, most unfit,</L>
<L>Travell, when tongues do run before the wit.</L>
<L>But if they both keep company together,</L>
<L>Delight and profit is in both, or eyther.</L>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<L>Discretion gravely goes a gentle pace,</L>
<L>When speech, a gallop, runs a heedles race:</L>
<L>Mans earthly portion 's travell, paine, and care,</L>
<L>(Of which I make a shift to get my share.)</L>
<L>Some do disdain, and hold it in high scorn</L>
<L>To know thatcht cottages where they were born</L>
<L>Some crosse the sea to see strange lands unknown</L>
<L>And heer, like strangers, do not know their own.</L>
<L>Their own, 'tis fit work for a golden pen</L>
<L>To write the names down of such knowing men:</L>
<L>Should ech on know &amp; have his own, 'twere rare</L>
<L>Right owners wold be rich, &amp; knaves stark bare.</L>
<L>Hee's counted wise, with the Italians,</L>
<L>That knows his own wife from another mans.</L>
<L>But hee's more wise that knows himselfe to be</L>
<L>Fraile, mortall, and a map of Misery.</L>
<L>But wisest he, that patient takes his lot,</L>
<L>And use the world as if he us'd it not.</L>
<L>Some seem to know most, yet know almost no∣thing,</L>
<L>For man, in knowledge, is a very slow thing.</L>
<L><HI>Nosce teipsum,</HI> Know thy selfe, and then</L>
<L>Each one will know himselfe the worst of men.</L>
<L>Many of forreign travels boast and vant,</L>
<L>When they, of <HI>England,</HI> are most ignorant.</L>
<L>But yeerly I survey my Country Native,</L>
<L>And, mongst 6. cases, live upon the <HI>Dative.</HI></L>
<L>I travell hard, and for my lifes supply,</L>
<L>I every yeere receive a Subsidie.</L>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<L>(Or else to come more neer unto the sence)</L>
<L>'Tis fit to call it a Benevolence.</L>
<L>Thus (travelling) a toyling trade I drive,</L>
<L>By reason of mine age, neer seventy five:</L>
<L>It is my earthly portion and my lot,</L>
<L>(The Proverb says, <HI>Need makes the old wife trot.</HI>)</L>
<L>Seven times at sea I serv'd <HI>Elizabeth,</HI></L>
<L>And 2. Kings forty five yeers, untill death</L>
<L>Of both my Royall Masters quite bereft me,</L>
<L>That nothing now but age and want is left me.</L>
<L>This makes me travell, and my friends to trie,</L>
<L>Else I might (like my fellowes) sterve and die.</L>
<L>Had the last State, had consciences so tender</L>
<L>To think on Oxford siedge, with that surrender,</L>
<L>Had they kept Articles and Covenants,</L>
<L>In some sort, then they had releev'd our wants.</L>
<L>But they were in the land of Promise borne,</L>
<L>Perform'd, and paid us nothing, but their scorn.</L>
<L><HI>Camelion</HI> like we had <HI>Ayre, Words,</HI> and <HI>Wind,</HI></L>
<L>With these three empty dishes oft we din'd.</L>
<L>And with light Suppers, and such breaking Fast,</L>
<L>With meagre Famine, many breath'd their last.</L>
<L>we nere bare arms, but houshold servants menial</L>
<L>We waited, if 'twere sin, it was but veniall.</L>
<L>These thirteen yeers no wages I could get,</L>
<L>Which makes me thus to try my friends &amp; wit.</L>
<L>Unto the Kings Revenews great Committee</L>
<L>We oft Petitiond, and implor'd their pitty;</L>
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<L>And first and last, we gave Petitions plenty,</L>
<L>I'm sure, in number, neer two hundred twenty.</L>
<L>Two thousand Books &amp; Bils then printed were,</L>
<L>Wherein our woes and wants wee did declare:</L>
<L>Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> was himselfe Lord Generall then,</L>
<L>He pitied us (poor miserable men;)</L>
<L>And he in person, more then one time went</L>
<L>And told our griefes unto the Parliament.</L>
<L>Besides, for us, to them he Letters wrot,</L>
<L>For all which, only, promises we got.</L>
<L>I will not curse those men, but this I say,</L>
<L>If need and want afflict them, I doe pray</L>
<L>They may be comforted, and fed, and clad</L>
<L>With promises, as we from them have had.</L>

<L>TH' yeer sixteen hundred fifty, with 3. added,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Tib</HI> my Mare, and I, a journy gadded:</L>
<L>I <HI>London</HI> left, the 9. day I remember</L>
<L>Of August, neer 3. weeks before September.</L>
<L>In 4. houres riding Post I got to <HI>Croydon,</HI></L>
<L>And so hath many a man, and many a boy done.</L>
<L>There was the George a horseback day &amp; night,</L>
<L>And there I, from my mares back did alight.</L>
<L>At Water there wine was, but that's a Riddle,</L>
<L>At <HI>Croydon,</HI> you may know both ends &amp; middle.</L>
<L>To <HI>Micham,</HI> from my way full 3. miles wide,</L>
<L>A Gentleman, I thank him, was my guide.</L>
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>
<L>Holland my sheets, and <HI>Holland</HI> was mine Host,</L>
<L>My entertainment good for little cost,</L>
<L>August the tenth, my bonny Beast and I,</L>
<L>From Surrey traveld to South Saxony,</L>
<L>Now called Sussex, where at <HI>Bellinshurst</HI></L>
<L>Six dayes I felt no hunger, cold, or thirst.</L>
<L>There at a sign, and no sign but a Frame,</L>
<L>Twas the Kings arms, but shatering shot &amp; flame</L>
<L>Did beat them down, as useles, of small stead,</L>
<L>For armes are of no use without a Head.</L>
<L>Mine Host was mighty good, and great withall,</L>
<L>And, amongst Hosts, may be a Generall.</L>
<L>Hee's friendly, curteous, although big and burly,</L>
<L>A right good fellow, no way proud or surly.</L>
<L>Six nights at <HI>Bellinshurst</HI> I freely stayd,</L>
<L>And all the charge of mare and man was payd</L>
<L>By a Gentleman, to name whom Ile refrain,</L>
<L>Whose love, my thankfull mind shall stil retain.</L>
<L>Thus in one week I rode Post 30. mile,</L>
<L>And neither man or mare tyr'd all that while.</L>
<L>A Reverend Preacher preach'd on Sunday twice</L>
<L>Directing souls to th' Heavenly Paradice.</L>
<L>And if we could but do as he did say,</L>
<L>His Doctrine told us all the ready way.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Billinshurst</HI> thy bounty I extoll,</L>
<L>Thou feastedst me in body and in soule.</L>
<L>There was rare Musick, sweet and gentile <HI>Ayres,</HI></L>
<L>For undeserved favours, <HI>I am theirs.</HI></L>
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
<L>My love to Mr. <HI>Fist,</HI> and to mine Host,</L>
<L>But love and thanks <HI>T. H.</HI> deserveth most.</L>
<L>From <HI>Billinshurst,</HI> August the sixteenth day,</L>
<L>I took my leave, before I took my way.</L>
<L>The way indifferent good, the welk in smiles,</L>
<L>I rode to <HI>Petworth,</HI> 7. good Sussex miles.</L>
<L>To set forth <HI>Petworth,</HI> its worth more worth is,</L>
<L>Then I am worth, or worthy; but know this,</L>
<L><HI>Northumberland</HI> the Noble, there doth dwell,</L>
<L>Whose good housekeeping, few Lords parallell.</L>
<L>There Honourable bounty is exprest,</L>
<L>With daily charity to th' poor distrest.</L>
<L>I speak not this for any thing I got</L>
<L>Of that great Lord, I felt or saw him not:</L>
<L>For had I seen him, my beliefe is such,</L>
<L>I should have felt and found his bounties tutch:</L>
<L>But I, for my part, never was so rude</L>
<L>To flatter, fawn, or basely to intrude,</L>
<L>Yet I declare him liberall, Honourable,</L>
<L>And there I din'd well, at his Stewards Table.</L>
<L>Thanks Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> there, the Cook exact</L>
<L>By his good friendship there, I nothing lackd.</L>
<L>Thanks to my Hostesse kind, good Mrs. <HI>Martin,</HI></L>
<L>who welcom'd me with good whit wine a quart in.</L>
<L>And last of all, but not of all the least,</L>
<L>I was kind Mr. <HI>Barnards</HI> costly Guest:</L>
<L>To me he shew'd his bounty from the Mint,</L>
<L>For which I give him heer my thanks in Print.</L>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
<L>He payd the chinque, and freely gave me drink,</L>
<L>And I returne my gratitude with Inke.</L>
<L><HI>August</HI> the 18. twelve long miles to <HI>Stenning</HI></L>
<L>I rode, and nothing saw there worth the kenning,</L>
<L>But that mine Host there was a joviall Wight,</L>
<L>My Hostess fat and fair; a goodly sight:</L>
<L>The signe the Chequer, eighteen pence to pay;</L>
<L>My Mare eat mortal meat, good Oats and Hay.</L>
<L>Twelve miles from <HI>Stenning</HI> I jogd on to <HI>Lewes,</HI></L>
<L>And there I found no Beggars, Scolds, or Shrews;</L>
<L><HI>Lewes</HI> hath no Bayliff, Mayor, or Magistrate,</L>
<L>For every one there lives in quiet state:</L>
<L>They quarrell not for wagging of a straw,</L>
<L>For each man is unto himselfe a Law;</L>
<L>They need no bridle (like the Horse or Mule)</L>
<L>Where every one himselfe can wisely rule.</L>
<L>At the terrestriall Star (a glistring Signe)</L>
<L>I lodg'd, and found good Diet, and good Wine;</L>
<L>Mine Host and Hostess courteous, free, and kind,</L>
<L>And there I sip'd and sup'd, but seldom din'd:</L>
<L><HI>Lewes</HI> is an ancient Town, as may be seen</L>
<L>In <HI>Cambden,</HI> page three hundred and thirteen:</L>
<L>Twelve men they chuse, the most substantiallest,</L>
<L>Most rich and wise, to govern all the rest;</L>
<L>And out of that discreet and honest dozen,</L>
<L>Two (as it were) high Constables are chosen:</L>
<L>These have no pow'r themselvs to hang or draw,</L>
<L>Or on offendors to inflict the Law;</L>
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>
<L>But to a Justice of the Peace, or <HI>Coram</HI></L>
<L>They bring the parties, &amp; their cause before am.</L>
<L>From Friday unto Friday I did stay,</L>
<L>But in the mean time I did take my way</L>
<L>Five miles to <HI>Torring</HI> where my old friend there,</L>
<L>The Parson welcom'd me with Country cheer;</L>
<L>His name is <HI>John,</HI> or honest Master <HI>Rice,</HI></L>
<L>Six meals he meated me, and lodgd me thrice.</L>
<L>He Preachd on Sunday, <HI>Augusts</HI> twenty one,</L>
<L>Two Sermons, tending to salvation:</L>
<L>His Doctrine's good, &amp; he himselfe doth frame</L>
<L>To live in conversation like the same.</L>
<L>I thank him, and his Wife and Family,</L>
<L>For making of so much (too much) of me:</L>
<L>Thus when he could no longer me retaine,</L>
<L>With love and thanks, I rode to <HI>Lewes</HI> againe.</L>
<L>This Town contains six Churches, and at least</L>
<L>It is a mile in length from West to East:</L>
<L>A strong and spacious Castle there hath been,</L>
<L>As by its moldred ruines may be see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</L>
<L>Thence 12 miles I was on my female beast born,</L>
<L>T'an unknown feast born, at a Towne cal'd East <HI>Bourne;</HI></L>
<L>I at an Inne alighted, and found there</L>
<L>Unlook'd for welcome, and good <HI>Sussex</HI> cheer:</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Thomas Dike,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Parker,</HI> Knights,</L>
<L>With kinde Esquires, whose names &amp; Epithites</L>
<L>I mention not, because I know them not;</L>
<L>But to them all my thanks is unforgot,</L>
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>
<L>For undeserv'd, unlook'd for, and unthought,</L>
<L>From thē my purse &amp; person both were fraught;</L>
<L>This was on <HI>Augusts</HI> twenty sixt, a Friday,</L>
<L>Near <HI>Dog dayes end,</HI> a very fair and drie day.</L>
<L>The next day, and the next I felt the bounty</L>
<L>Of the high Sheriff of <HI>Sussex</HI> famous County;</L>
<L>He entertain'd me Saturday and Sunday,</L>
<L>And would have kept me 20 dayes past Monday.</L>
<L>There was a high and mighty drink call'd <HI>Rug,</HI></L>
<L>Sure since the Reigne of great King <HI>Gorbodug</HI></L>
<L>Was never such a rare infus'd confection,</L>
<L>Injection, operation, and ejection,</L>
<L>Are <HI>Hogen Mogen Rugs,</HI> great influences</L>
<L>To provoke sleep, and stupifie the sences.</L>
<L>No cold can ever pierce his flesh or skin</L>
<L>Of him who is well lin'd with <HI>Rug</HI> within:</L>
<L><HI>Rug</HI> is a Lord beyond the Rules of Law;</L>
<L>It conquers hunger in the greedy maw:</L>
<L>And (in a word) of all the drinks potable,</L>
<L><HI>Rug</HI> is most puisant, potent, notable.</L>
<L><HI>Rug</HI> was the Capitall Commander there,</L>
<L>And his Lievtenant Generall was strong Beere.</L>
<L>Wine plenteous both in Bottles and in flaggons.</L>
<L>whose strēgth would quel S. <HI>George</HI> &amp; 20 draggōs</L>
<L>But <HI>Asshuerus</HI> Laws were there inrol'd,</L>
<L>No man was forc'd to drink more then he would.</L>
<L>There was good <HI>Will,</HI> good <HI>Wills son,</HI> &amp; good <HI>Williā</HI></L>
<L>As free as was the Emp'rour <HI>Maximilian:</HI></L>
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>
<L>Beasts, fowls and fish, from earth, &amp; sea &amp; ayre</L>
<L>Unto the Table, well Cook'd, did repair,</L>
<L>There were rare Birds I never saw before</L>
<L>The like of them, I think to see no more:</L>
<L>Th'are called <HI>Wheat ears,</HI> less then Lark or Spar∣row,</L>
<L>Wel roasted, in the mouth they tast like marow.</L>
<L>When once tis in the teeth it is involv'd,</L>
<L>Bones, flesh, and all, is lushiously dissolv'd.</L>
<L>The name of <HI>Wheat ears,</HI> on them is ycleap'd,</L>
<L>Because they come when wheat is yeerly reap'd.</L>

<L>Twelve miles on Augusts 9. and 20. day,</L>
<L>From <HI>Bourne</HI> to <HI>Battell,</HI> 4. miles on my way</L>
<L>At <HI>Pemsey</HI> doth a ruin'd Castle stand,</L>
<L>And there the Norman Conqueror did land.</L>
<L>Since his invading power arived there,</L>
<L>'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow 500, 60, and 6. yeere.</L>
<L>Eight miles from thence, the Battel fierce was strook</L>
<L>Where bloud of 70000, like a Brook,</L>
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>
<L>Or rather I may say like <HI>Sanguin</HI> Rivers</L>
<L>Which down hills, it impetuously delivers</L>
<L>Into the Vales: and where that bloud was spilt</L>
<L>The Conqueror caus'd an Abbey to be built</L>
<L>Of stately structure, and what it hath been,</L>
<L>By great extended ruines may be seen.</L>
<L>VVhen Norman forces <HI>England</HI> overcame,</L>
<L>From bloudy Battell, <HI>Battell</HI> had its name.</L>
<L>This Abbey now is kept, by right and due,</L>
<L>By the Honourable Viscount <HI>Montague.</HI></L>
<L>That Lord repair'd some part magnificent,</L>
<L>And ther's good house kept, when hees resident.</L>
<L>That noble Lord is, in account most famous,</L>
<L>Though many miserable Lords doe shame us.</L>
<L>At th' Empereall crest, or Eagle spred,</L>
<L>My selfe and mare, were stabled, lodg'd and fed.</L>
<L>About the reckoning I did not contend,</L>
<L>My friend <HI>T. H.</HI> paid all, and ther's an end.</L>
<L>August the thirtith, I rode on to <HI>Hastings,</HI></L>
<L>Wher was relief for men of severall tastings,</L>
<L>Or sundry pallats, put them altogether,</L>
<L>Or relisht appetites, take all or neither.</L>
<L>At <HI>Hastings</HI> I staid not, but hastily</L>
<L>I ambled 6. miles unto <HI>Winchelsey:</HI></L>
<L>Which hath been counted in the dayes of yore,</L>
<L>(Untill the seas contended with the shore)</L>
<L>A famous sea Town, rich in merchandise,</L>
<L>But buried in the Ocean now it lies.</L>
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>
<L>A Castle stands i'th sands, enduring flawes,</L>
<L>Gusts, tempests, storms, &amp; times devouring jaws:</L>
<L>In twice twelve hours, 'tis twice embraced round</L>
<L>In th' arms of <HI>Neptune,</HI> seeming to be drownd:</L>
<L>And when the flouds are eb'd into the main,</L>
<L>Three miles in sands 'tis compast round again.</L>
<L>In <HI>Winchelsey</HI> that now is I could ken</L>
<L>Nothing worth observation of my pen.</L>
<L>Two miles from thence, upon a hill, stands <HI>Rye,</HI></L>
<L>And there I, at the Star, did lodge and lie:</L>
<L>More ods there is 'twixt singing songs and crying</L>
<L>Then was betwixt my lodging, and my lying.</L>
<L>I lodg'd by night, and I did lie by day,</L>
<L>And as upon a bed I musing lay,</L>
<L>The chamber hang'd with painted cloth, I found</L>
<L>My selfe with sentences beleaguerd round.</L>
<L>There was Philosophy and History,</L>
<L>Poetry Aenigmatick mystery.</L>
<L>I know not what the Town in wealth may be,</L>
<L>But sure, I on that chambers walls did see</L>
<L>More wit then al the town had, and more worth</L>
<L>Then my unlearned Muse can well set forth.</L>
<L>I will not hold my Reader in dilemma,</L>

<L>My fare was good at <HI>Rye,</HI> my Reck'ning small,</L>

<L>So Muddy, that they mir'de my Mare and mee:</L>
<L>I past them, And on <HI>vltima Augusti,</HI></L>
<L>well meated, Mounted, man and beast both lusty;</L>
<L>I cross'd or'e <HI>Gulford</HI> ferry, and I went</L>
<L>From <HI>Rye</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> unto <HI>Hide</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI></L>
<L>Septembers first day, <HI>Sol,</HI> with golden eye</L>
<L>Gilt <HI>Neptune</HI> with celestiall Alcaymie:</L>
<L>With sovereign splendor, kissing medows green,</L>
<L>And mantled hills tops were coruscant seen.</L>
<L>VVhen <HI>Phoebus</HI> mounted was in glorious pride,</L>
<L>I mounted too, and rode away from <HI>Hide.</HI></L>
<L>Still as I past through sea Towns first and last,</L>
<L>I did enquire how businesses had past.</L>
<PB N="22" REF="12"/>
<L>The people said that Guns did bounce &amp; thump,</L>
<L>Betwixt our <HI>English</HI> ships, and Dutch <HI>Van Trump.</HI></L>
<L>At <HI>Rumney,</HI> and at <HI>Hide,</HI> they were in sight,</L>
<L>Folks heard the drums to beat, and saw the fight.</L>
<L>Thus, little was the newes from sea or shore,</L>
<L>Our weekly News books will tel 3. times more.</L>
<L>From <HI>Hide</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI> and to <HI>Canterbury</HI></L>
<L>Full 25. miles, dirty, wet and weary,</L>
<L>I took my lodging up, and down I lay</L>
<L>Till Friday came, Septembers second day.</L>
<L>Then with the Lamb I arose, and with the Lark</L>
<L>I got to <HI>Gravesend</HI> when 'twas almost dark;</L>
<L>But I mistake, from sleep I rowz'd my head,</L>
<L>And rose with th'Lark, but went with Lamb to bed.</L>
<L>On th' way I was not vext with Gates or Stiles,</L>
<L>But three and thirty dirty Kentish miles,</L>

<L>I there was welcome empty, welcome full:</L>

<L>I found most potent admirable Ale,</L>
<L>'Tis second to no drink, but <HI>East-Bourne Rug,</HI></L>
<L>Put it in Pot or Flaggon, Can or Jug;</L>
<L>You'le finde it is the grand Ale, and you'l grant,</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE North part of this Shire confronts upon Surrey, and Kent: the West but∣teth upon Hamshire; and all the rest of the County lieth stretched along the British sea. The City of most account within this County is Chichester, a beautifull, and large Towne; yet for the statelinesse of buildings <HI>Lewes</HI> doth seeme to contend with it, where <HI>William de Warron</HI> built a strong Castle, whereun∣to the Barons, in time of those civill brotles resorted in warlike manner, and fought a great Battell against their Soveraigne and his sonne, wherein the King,

<P>Places of other note are these.
