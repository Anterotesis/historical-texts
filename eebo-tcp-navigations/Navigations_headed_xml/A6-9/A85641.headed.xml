<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He King of <HI>Scots</HI> hath resumed the way of me∣diation for peace and union between his Roy∣all Majesty, and the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> propo∣sing (as an Expedient) that Cardinal <HI>Maza∣rin</HI> might be sent away as a Commissioner to treat about the general peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> but the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> seemed to wave it at present, until such time, that
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>by the advice and counsel of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> he was moved to accord thereunto; in pursuance whereof his roy∣all Highness gave his assent, That young <HI>Charles</HI> should be permitted to persue his mediation. Whereupon He imme∣diatly sent the Lord <HI>Montague</HI> with a Message to K. <HI>Lewis,</HI> wherein he declared himself as followeth:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of declaration">
<OPENER>May it please your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>WHereas by sad experience (in these our late distem∣pered and unhappy Times) We are sensible of the great Miseries and Calamities that are incident both to Prince and People, upon the distempers arising between the Head and Members, occurring chiefly from the flames of those, who are frighted with mortal apprehensions, and re∣tain unto themselves diversity of fears and jealousies, at the remembrance of those dangers, which wise Counsels, and great Favourites, may suddenly involve them in: There∣fore, having seriously weighed the sad effects thereof, and the great devastation that doth befall both Crown &amp; King∣doms thereby, which with grief of heart I speak it, I hum∣bly offer to your Majesty this Expedient, for preventing of these inevitable Ruines, That your Majesty will be pleased to consider upon some convenient way for the expelling of the Cardinal (though it were but a limitation of time pre∣fixed within your Royal Breast) and to satisfie the desires of the people; without which, little safety can be expected, and all hopes of Reconcilement utterly frustrated and taken away.</P>
<P>The King having received this Message, or Declaration, returned thanks to his Cousin <HI>Charles;</HI> but withall desired him not to intermeddle any further therein giving assurance that he was resolved to keep and protect the Cardinal.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Citizens of <HI>Paris</HI> were exceedingly ex∣asperated
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>in spirit, offering to raise 20000 men for the Pr. of <HI>Conde</HI> against the King: but its probable, that upon re∣ceit of the unwelcome tydings of the great blow given to the Princes forces by Gen. <HI>Turein,</HI> and valiant <HI>James Stuart,</HI> they may change their resolutions: for, indeed, the Defeat was great, being managed by a surprisal; the exact Rela∣tion whereof, take as followeth:</P>
<P>The King drawing near <HI>Paris,</HI> Marshal <HI>Turein,</HI> Generall <HI>Hocquincourt,</HI> and Col. <HI>Stuart</HI> being to attend the march of the Court with their Armies, came along the Rivers of <HI>Yonne</HI> and <HI>Seine:</HI> And <HI>Turein</HI> perceiving that if he got be∣twixt the Princes Army and <HI>Paris,</HI> he might be able to in∣terrupt their communication with the Parisians, marched with such care and expedition, that he arrived at <HI>Chartres,</HI> while the same time the Princes army removed from <HI>Mon∣targis</HI> to <HI>Estampes:</HI> And being resolved to set upon the ene∣my, he marched all night, and found them daawing up their army near <HI>Estampes;</HI> who spying the Kings army, immedi∣atly retired into the Town, placing their Foot within the Works and Fortifications; but caused their Horse to pass the River.</P>
<P>Hereupon the two Generals drew up near the Walls of the Town; and perceiving a good space of ground not wel guarded betwixt the outmost Suburbs and the Town, where they might cut off that part of the Suburbs, they attempted that place, and began the assault with much resolution, and the Town was well maintained by the Defendants; but the Kings Ordnance having the advantage of a commanding Hillock, did so annoy the Princes party in the Town, and made a breach in the Wall, so that the Kings forces entred; and after a sharp dispute, became Masters of the Town, sei∣zing upon the Magazine, and putting divers to the sword: during this dispute, the titular Duke of <HI>York,</HI> brake in with the horse, doing great execution.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>The Princes party were almost all killed, or taken, and his own Regiment totally cut off; for they denyed quarter. The Horse stood all upon a Hill, on the other side of the River, as Spectators of this bloudy Tragedy, and never attempted to relieve the Foot. The occasion of the Princes Army draw∣ing out thus, was to welcome Madamoiselle from <HI>Orleans,</HI> whence she came to see them. This action was the more observable, in that the Kings party consisted onely of 2000 Foot, and 500 Horse, against 6000 of the Princes; notwith∣standing they had the advantages of a deep Trench, a strong Wall, and the Town it self. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> (for so he is called here) commanded the Kings horse, who charged so puissantly, that his very first Onset sufficiently testified he fought either to Death or Victory; for after the first Vol∣ley, he brake in upon <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and the Princes own Re∣giment, doing great execution, and making the field resound with shrill ecchoes: In this fight was slain Mounsieur <HI>de Bloin,</HI> a Gentleman of irresistable courage: Yet notwith∣standing, the loss whereof, could not damp the general re∣joycing for so important a Victory: Which was pursued with such eagerness of spirit by the aforesaid Duke, that the Kings party were in half an hours time exceedingly tran∣sported with excess of gladness.</P>
<P>The King hearing of this Victory, sent an Express to young <HI>James,</HI> to hasten to the Court, where he was triumphantly entertained, and is now in great esteem amongst the <HI>French;</HI> Immediatly after his reception, he presented the King with a Narrative of the whole business, and a particular List of the Officers and Souldiers killed and taken on both sides: a Copy whereof I have hereunto annexed.</P>

<P>Since this great Defeat, we hear, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> hath taken the field with his new Auxiliaries; and that He hath sent a Letter to the Parliament, inviting over the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> to his assistance: Indeed, they are as much desired by the one party, as dejected by the other: but that which cau∣seth the most admiration, is, their drawing towards the Sea∣coast, whose design is said to be for the Port of <HI>Bordeaux.</HI> Several Commissions are given forth by the Scots King to raise forces against England; but amongst the rest Sir <HI>Geo. Carteret,</HI> late Governor of the Isle of <HI>Jersey</HI> hath broken his Articles with the Parl. by his actuall engagement against them, for the King; having already got 7 Frigats at Sea, &amp; a Commission to fight and plunder the English: He hath lately been abroad with the <HI>Francis, Patrick,</HI> and <HI>Michael,</HI> which carry 44 pieces of Ordnance, and hath taken a gal∣lant ship bound for Newfound Land, wherein was great store of Gold and Silver.
