<P>AS unknown, I salute you, having at present an im∣perfection of lamenesse, which is the occasion of me not coming unto you my self, but have sent this bea∣rer: The businesse is, that last year having a Kinsman, a Marchant, that was desirous to go to the Barbadoes upon such affaires as seem'd best to himself, he telling me, that he was to go upon a ship, whereof one <HI>Francis Hardedge</HI> was to go Commander, and according to my knowledg he had shipt a ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insufficient Chyrurgion, not worthy to undergo that place in a Spr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, which without doubt he very we I knew, I did dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wade my Kinsman from proceeding with him, telling him, that he would find his nature nor differ from his name; his reply was, would he had known of it sooner, for then he could o∣therwise disposed of himself, but now it was to late.

<P>MY love remembred unto you, we arrived here the 13. of this moneth I came very sick ashore, and am not well yet, I think if I had been two dayes longer at Sea I had fed fishes; for <HI>Mr. Hardedge</HI> victualled his Ship with stinking Beefe and Fish, and that infected our blouds; insomuch, that there was sixty, seventy, and eigh∣ty sick at a time, our Surgeon a Dunce, and kept his Cabbin all the cold weather; hee laid a man so fast a∣sleep, he never waked again, and being asked why he gave him so much opium, he answered, he did not know, hee was bound in his body, And our Master allowed us but meal a day, and stinking Bevaradge, and not enough of
<PB N="5" REF="4"/><!-- PDF PAGE 8 -->that neither. There was not one person but was sick two or three times, except one Gentleman and my self, who held out till within four days of our arrivall: In our sick∣nesse our Master would not allow us water to drink, not∣withstanding he brought ten Tun into the Harbour, and hath sold thirty Tun of Beer for himself and others. Nei∣ther would he allow us Oatmeal to make water-grewel; And if he had, there was not one corn of Salt in the ship to season although we lay a moneth in the Downes, and often desired him to buy some: The sick people had no∣thing but the thin broath of the Peas, and because they could eate no bisket he took that from them, and when they were well, they would have eate five or sixe Cakes a day, it they could have got them, insomuch they loo∣ked like death it selfe.</P>
<P>He denyed a woman with child beer, that was brought to bed two dayes after, and perisht, and three more, and the Child: wee cast over-board my Lord of <HI>Carlile</HI> his Secretary, I pray remember me to Mr. <HI>Crews:</HI> So I rest,</P>
