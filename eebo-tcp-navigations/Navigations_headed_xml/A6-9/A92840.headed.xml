<OPENER><SALUTE>Most worthy and beloved friend:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He last Letter which I sent to you, contained a Com∣plaint against the wicked, <HI>envious,</HI> and subtle practi∣ces of Popish and prophane malignants here, all which assaulting of us from the beginning of this Parliament, unto this very houre, one after another, have yet notwithstanding hitherto, through Gods speciall blessing, beene made frustrate; from which how deep a foundation of confidence is laid up in the hearts of all pious men, that God is amongst us, you may as readily conceive as I can ex∣presse. When did God (who neither wants wisdome to resolve, nor po∣wer to execute) cease from finishing his worke unto which he did at any time apply his hand? We haply may for a longer time be exercised, and by reason of the open armes and hidden contrivances, of Gods and our enemies, be put to the combat in this Land; however we may yet comfort our selves, <HI>as you sometimes did</HI> with your Zelandish Lion <HI>(Lu∣ctor &amp; emergo)</HI> i. e With struggling out of the deeps. For, <HI>Si Deus nobis∣cum, quis contra nos?</HI> i. e. If God be for us, who can be against us? These were the Mottoes of your Comfort in the times of your anxious grie∣vances, under the bloody persecution of the King of <HI>Spaine;</HI> and from your happy successe out of your pressures, and the daily experience of Gods miraculous and mercifull blessing toward us, we are taught to cor∣roborate our hearts, in the midst of all our adversities, with the same comfortable meditations It may well be controverted and called into question, which of the two be most predominant, whether the sorrow which we have from the obstacles and impediments which we doe uncessantly meet withall in the so much longed for, and daily laboured for work of Reformation both of Church and State: or else the joy and comfort which we receive from the observation, that he which dwels in the Heavens doth laugh upon all the designes of our enemies, and doth as it were out of the clouds every foot reveale unto us their treacherous Plots. But this is that which doth cordially grieve, and as it were pierce all honest soules amongst us to the very heart: that you our neighbours, who have beene so remarkably in former times
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> advanced by us to that liberty both spirituall and temporall, wherein you doe yet stand in spite of all your enemies, onely by Gods almighty arme, I say, this troubles us exceedingly, that you which are our Con∣federates, yea Confessors with us of one faith, members of one Church, and enemies of one and the same Antichrist the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> should so far f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your selves, and recede so far from the pious Maximes of your most laudable Ancestours, that <HI>you, I say,</HI> like a spurious generation, fo∣stred and bred up in the pure worship of God, in the Christian Refor∣med Religion, should become enemy to your Mother, and attempt to persecute that precious faith, which hath made you great, bostering up, and assisting the enemies of Gods Church, who being sworne Vassals of the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and intoxicated with Spanish and Jesuiticall Ma∣ximes, aime at nothing else, but in time quite and cleane to extirpate the Reformed Religion, and the pious Professours thereof. Your do∣ings against the Reformed Church in the Kingdome of France, doe yet remaine fresh in memory, the assistance which you afforded against those of <HI>Rochel</HI> hath so stigmatized your Nation, that your Posterity for many generations to come will not be able to raze it out. Give me leave to tell you that which all the world knowes well enough, that your Fleet sent forth against those of <HI>Rochel,</HI> was sufficient to have been the only cause, that (that place which was the only place of security in all <HI>France,</HI> for those which were of our Religion) was lost, and consequent∣ly, that the condition of those which professe our Religion in those parts was brought to that passe, that now (they having no longer any place of security reserved for them) they live only at the mercy of their professed enemies, who (as it were) have their knives upon their throats, and may dispatch them without any feare, whensoever it shall be su∣table to their mindes, and to their occasions: These are the very cour∣ses which you begin to take against us, indeed not as yet so manifest∣ly, but yet not a whit the lesse dangerously. True, you doe not at once send a Fleet against us, or a whole Army; but you send so many Ships successively one after another, with all sorts of Warlike Ammunition, Officers, and common Souldiers, as that they may well be reputed to be a considerable Fleet or Army: and all this <HI>is done by you,</HI> to arme, to bolster up to animate the Popish Faction (who would not be able long to hold out, were they not supplied with such tooles as these are from you) insomuch as that, so far as lyes in your power▪ you go about to make these Conquerours against us your Brethren, and fellow-mem∣bers of the same houshold of Faith.</P>
<P>This, I say, doth grieve and wound our soules, and that not only in
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> respect of our owne selves, but also in respect of your own Country, and of so many holy soules amongst you, as I am certainly confident doe from their hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s sorrow for these evill actions, and doe without cea∣sing sigh unto God in the heavens against them. We have hard mea∣sure, that we should be so dealt withall by you, that you should seeme to place your honour in having the greatest and most visible hand in promoting our ruine and desolation by Hispaniolized and Jesuicicall Papists, who by your meanes are armed against us, furnished with Of∣ficers, and as it were, set upon their legs by you. But I repeat it againe, <HI>(Si Deus pro nobis quis contra nos?)</HI> we hope not only to stand it out against our enemies, but also to be able with honour to manage our affaires, through the helpe of the Almighty, who having as yet, and that so of∣ten, both against open violence and secret practices, powerfully and mi∣raculously defended us, doth thereby plentifully assure us, that he will without molestation perfect that work of Reformation which he hath begunne amongst us, although it should so fall out as that mans helpe should not only cease, but though heaven and earth should lift up them∣selves against us, for those who are for us, are more then they who are against us. And yet our mercifull God doth not suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r us to want ei∣ther for many desirable meanes amongst us, or of good affections of strangers from abroad toward us: we are reasonably well furnished with Souldiers, Officers, Money and Weapons. Our Brethren, the Scots (whom men by all means have sought to corrupt, to abuse, and to make up against us) have publiquely declared themselves for us the last of the foregoing moneth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> and in pursuance of this Declara∣tion, they have dispatched three Commissioners, of whom one is that famous and incorrupt Zelote for the prosperity of Church and State, Sir <HI>Archibald Iohnston,</HI> whom Secretary <HI>Lanerick,</HI> in the name of the King would faine, yet without successe, have kept out of the forena∣med Commission. Now these Commissioners are charged in the name of the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to request his Majesty, that he would re∣turne to his Parliament assembled together in <HI>London,</HI> signe the Act for the abdication of the Bishops, as also that he would attest the Act about the convocating of a Synod, or an Ecclesiasticall Assembly, consisting of divers Godly and Learned Divines, for the contriving of another Ecclesiasticall Government, different from what hath beene upheld hi∣therto under the Bishops, even such as should be conformable to Gods word; that he would disbandon his Popish Armies, and be pleased as speedily as may be to assemble a Parliament in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Unto which particulars if it please his Majesty to yeeld, then we may quickly ob∣taine
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> a good understanding betwixt us: but if he stand off, then our Brethren of <HI>Scotland</HI> will quickly joyne in with us for the maintaining of our cause, which also is their owne. And all this so far, as that our gracious God doth more and more cause us to see the meanes by which wee hope speedily to see a successefull and a desirable issue <HI>out of our troubles.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore though it doth grieve us very much to be so ill dealt with∣all by you yet it troubles us no lesse to see you in these particulars so much to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to fight against God. The cause which we main∣taine is Gods cause, and therefore you may assure your selves, that by these indirect wayes of persecution, you doe as it were open the mouth of the Lord wide from the highest Heavens to say unto you, as some∣times he did to <HI>Saul,</HI> when he was an open persecutor of the Church of <HI>Damascus,</HI> Netherland, Netherland, why persecutest thou me? it will be hard <HI>for thee to kicke against the pricks.</HI></P>
<P>But that I may a little the more clearly discover the equity of these my Complaints and the righteousnesse of Gods insuing vengeance, <HI>which wil take hold of you,</HI> if you goe on in these evill wayes, I have thought fitting with <HI>this Letter</HI> to transmit unto you certaine Acts of State, that by perusing of them, and of what did farther follow upon them, may at length, together with all impartiall men, come to see how hypocri∣tically, unthankfully, and unmercifully you deale with us. At least here in <HI>England</HI> we have a rule, according to which we can make no o∣ther construction out of all these particulars neither doe we doubt, but that you also, if with a sound judgement you will looke into things, but that you will be constrained even against your selves <HI>to passe the like ver∣dict upon your selves.</HI></P>
<P>First of all, it is certaine, that so soone as ever that his Majesty the last Summer had withdrawne himselfe from the Parliament, and reti∣red to <HI>York</HI> assaying here to assemble and to draw up an Army together against his Parliament, which yet aimed then at nothing else, no more then it doth still (even as you sometimes did doe) but to defend their Liberties Lawes, and Priviledges to purge Gods Church amongst them from falsification in Doctrine and the remaining Leaven of Antichrist, and so to conforme themselves with the Reformed forraigne Churches in Doctrine, yea in Ceremonies and Discipline, so farre forth as it was possible; <HI>I say whilst they were about this,</HI> men from your quarters did presently begin to second this uncomely and incensed purpose of the King, (upon which he is put by profane Popish and Jesuiticall Coun∣sellours) with the convoy of People, Money, and warlike Ammuni∣tion,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> no otherwise then as if so be you had longed for an occasion ac∣cording to the Precident against those of <HI>Rochel,</HI> to promote the de∣struction of those which professed the reformed Religion in this King∣dome, and therfore did lay hold upon the very first opportunitie which did present it selfe unto you. Our Parliament disliking this, and fore∣seeing that by these dealings the foundations were laid, not onely in time quite and cleane to break off the commendable and profitable Al∣liance betwixt us and your State, and to change our long continued brotherly peace into an open warre, which would be most pernicious to both States, but that as for your parts the way was paved for our enemies, to oppresse Gods Church here: therfore the High and Ho∣nourable Assembly, for the preventing of the mentioned evills, thought fitting in <HI>September</HI> last to draw up and to dispatch an affectionate De∣claration to the Lords the States Generall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of your united Provinces, which was transmitted by Mr. <HI>Walter Strickland</HI> Esquire.</P>

<HEAD>The Declaration of the Lords and Commons of the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to the high and mighty Lords, the States of the <HI>United Provinces.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VVE the Lords and Commons in <HI>Parliament</HI> assembled, taking into serious consideration the meanes of composing the great distempers and combu∣stions begun in this Kingdome, which threaten the destruction and ruine of it, and of all other Protestant Princes and States, have thought good to make this Decla∣tion to the high and mighty Lords, the States of the <HI>Vnited Provinces,</HI> That wee understand by a Letter of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> a person fled out of this Kingdome for high Treason: That as he often endeavoured by his wicked and malicious Coun∣sells to make division between his Majesty and the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and hath been in great part the cause of that miserable and unnaturall warre which is made against us by his Majesty, so he hath laboured by all meanes in the <HI>Vnited Provinces</HI> to pro∣vide Armes, powder, and Ammunition for the fomenting of that warre, and ma∣king it more dangerous to this Kingdome; and for this purpose did addresse him∣selfe to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> by whose countenance and help (as wee are informed by the Lord <HI>Digbyes</HI> owne Letters) he hath made provision of great quantities of Ordnance, powder, Armes, and divers other other sorts of warlike provision.</P>
<P>And we are further informed by credible advertisement, that the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI> in favour of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and those other wicked Counsellours and in∣cendiaries, who being joyned together in these mischievous practices against the peace of this Kingdome, hath not only licenced, but the better to encourage divers Commanders, experienced Officers, and Souldiers to resort into this Kingdom in and of them against the <HI>Parliament,</HI> hath promised to reserve their places for them in their absence, and doth cause other provision of the same kind to be made, and pre∣pared to be sent over for their supply, to the great hurt of this Kingdome, and the danger of interrupting the most necessary profitable, and long continued amity between the two States.</P>
<P>We further desire to let them know, that we cannot believe that this is done by any authority or direction from their Lordships, considering the great help that they have received from this Kingdome, when heretofore they lay under the hea∣vie oppression of their Princes, and how conducible the friendship of this Nation (concurring with the wisedome, valour and industry of their owne people) hath been to the greatnesse and power which they now enjoy.</P>
<P>Neither can we thinke that they will be forward to help to make us slaves, who have been usefull and assistant in making them Freemen.</P>
<P>Or that they will forget that our troubles and dangers issue from the same foun∣taine with their owne; and that those who are set a worke to undermine Religi∣on and Liberty in the Kingdome are the same, which by open force did seeke to bereave them of both.</P>
<P>It cannot be unknowne to that wise State, that it is the Jesuiticall faction here,
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> that hath corrupted the Counsells of our King, the consciences of a great part of our Clergy, which hath plotted so many mischievous Designes, to destroy the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and still endeavoureth to divide <HI>Ireland</HI> from this Kingdome, by a most wicked and cruell Rebellion there, and to divide the King from his <HI>Parliament</HI> and People here, and by false slanders, and imputations of things never done nor in∣tended by us, hath incensed his Majesty, so as that after many bitter invectives published against us, without any just cause given, he hath now at last resolved to set up his Royall Standard, and draw his Sword for the destruction and ruine of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s most faithfull and obedient people, whom by the Lawes and Constitutions of this Kingdome, he is bound to preserve and protect.</P>
<P>The Cases and the Fortunes of both Estates being so involved and united, wee cannot expect to be hindered by them in our just defence, or that they will doe any thing, to aggravate the miseries and troubles of this Kingdome in the peace and happinesse whereof they have found much advantage, and by such unfriend∣ly and unseasonable supplies of our Common Enemies, make a way to their owne aswell as our ruine.</P>
<P>We therefore desire they may betimes looke into this mischiefe, and having searched it into the bottome, to stop the farther progresse of it, That they will not suffer more Ordnance, Armour, or any other like warlike provision to be brought over to strengthen those, who assoone as they shall prevayle against the <HI>Parliament</HI> (according to their principles and interests by which they are guided) will use that strength to the ruine of those from whom they have had it.</P>
<P>We desire they would not send over any Country men to further our destructi∣on, who were sent to them for their preservation, That they will not anticipate the spilling of English blood in an unnaturall Civill VVarre, which hath been so cheerefully and plentifully hazarded and spent in that just and honourable VVar by which they have been so long preserved, and to which the bloud of those per∣sons, and many other Subjects of this Kingdome is still in a manner dedicated, but rather that they will cashiere and discard from their imployment those that will presume to come over for that purpose.</P>
<P>And in satisfying these our reasonable and necessarie desires, they shall thereby not only secure us but themselves, yea, they shall most of all advantage his Maje∣sty, for whose service those things are pretended to be done.</P>
<P>The Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stion between his Majesty and <HI>Parliament</HI> is not, whether hee shall en∣joy the same prerogative and power which hath belonged to our former Kings, his Majesties Royall Predecessours, but whether that prerogative and power should be imploved to our defence, or to our ruine.</P>
<P>VVe expect nothing from him but security and protection from those mischie∣vous designes which have been so often multiplyed, and renewed against us, though hitherto (through Gods providence) as often frustrated.</P>
<P>It cannot be denyed by those who look indifferently on our proceedings and af∣faires, but that it will be more honour and wealth, safety and greatnesse to his Ma∣jesty in concurring with his <HI>Parliament,</HI> then in the course in which he now is: But so unhappy hath his Majesty and the Kingdome been in those, who have the great∣est influence upon his Counsells, that they looke more upon the prevailing of their
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> own party, then upon any those great advantages both to his Crowne and Royall person which he might obtaine by joyning with his people. And so cunning are those Factors for Popery, in prosecution of their owne aymes, that they can put on a counterfeit visage of honour, peace, and greatnesse upon those courses and coun∣sells, which have no truth and reality, but of weaknesse, dishonour, and miseries to his Majesty and whole Kingdome.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Strickland</HI> being come over to you with this Declaration into the Hague did desire audience the eighth of <HI>September,</HI> of the Lords the States Generall (who being taken up by occasion of the interlocution of a Lord Ambassadour, sent from our King) his worship was at length heard, after a long and toilsome attendance in the retireing Chamber, by deputed Commissioners, and the Declaration was received, which though it seemed strange to us here, that you not so much as knowing what we intended to propose to you, should be so unseasonable scrupu∣lous to entertain those <HI>in debita forma,</HI> which were dispatched from us, and to give audience unto them in what they were to deliver in our name; yet we did overlook this your slighting of us, from a speciall re∣gard which we bare to your Nation.</P>
<P>But it stops not here, in stead of the Lords the States generall affor∣ding due consideration to this our moving and amicable Declaration, in stead of answering of it, and of remedying of the injury complained of in it, by inquisition and punishment of those, vvhich had over shot themselves in these things, or of redressing these things by a solicitous circumspection in future times: I say, in stead of this, that remarkable Declaration of the Parliament was for a large time laid aside, and left unansvvered, none of the least reparations were offered for that vvhich had passed, and much lesse vvas there any punishment inflicted upon
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> any that had trespassed in this kinde: nay men were suffered, at least not hindered, to send over weapons, money, people, and that in great quantity and number, for the bolstering up of the enemies, and the ru∣ine of the Professors of the reformed Religion. Our Messenger, who did continually complaine of this, did fruitlesly lose his time, and (to speake the best of it) they laboured to appease him vvith faire speeches without fruits: I say as vve are informed here by good hands, men were so shie of our Messenger, that it was almost held to be a crime to confer vvith him, or to haunt his company.</P>
<P>This, as it did most extremely discourage many Gentlemen of the Parliament, who had particular information of all these particulars, so they, yea the vvhole Parliament vvere not a little exhilerated, that the Lords the States of the Province of Holland did so far heed our righte∣ous cause, and our complaints (vvhose memory for this shall ever bee blessed by us) as that they vvere pleased to arrest some ships vvith peo∣ple and ammunition, vvho othervvise should have been sent against us, to the enfeebling of us. And as the whole Parliament, because of this, vvas confirmed in their speciall affection tovvards the great and mighty Potentates the Lords the States of the Province of Holland, so they did desire to make it knovvne to their Greatnesse by a speciall Declaration, vvhich I have also thought fitting at this present to send unto you.

<P>It cannot be expressed what contentment this friendly Resolution of the States of the province of <HI>Holland</HI> did give to the Parliament: so much the ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, because, by a certaine Letter sent from <HI>Zealand</HI> to a certain Gentleman here we are informed, that the Lords of your Province out of their special affection to the cause of Gods Church, and consequently

<P>This Ansvver of the Lords the States generall was indeed belovv the expectation of divers vvorthy Gentlemen of the Parliament, because it doth altogether passe by divers remarkable points, and doth but curso∣rily touch upon others, and does speake equivocally of them all; and speakes not a word of vvhat had passed already, against vvhich yet the Parliament did so expresly and earnestly complaine in their Declara∣tion, (though to speake truth vve are informed, that the Commissaries of the Province of Holland did say for the excusing of the matter, and did desire that it might be booked dovvne, that that did happen with∣out the privity of the Government) yet notwithstanding this Answer
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> was so far entertained with thanks by the Parliament, as it did solemnly promise, that there should be no transporting of Weapons, warlike Ammunition, or of Officers and Souldiers, but that a carefull Neutra∣lity should be maintained tovvards both sides. Which vvas also, upon occasion of the reiterated complaints of our Messenger Master <HI>Strick∣land,</HI> corroborated and confirmed by divers other resolutions, made for that end in the Assembly of the States generall on the 6. and 21. of the said <HI>November</HI> respectively.</P>
<P>But to what purpose are promises without performances? words vvithout deeds? Is it fitting? Is it Christian? yea, is it so much as civill, to promise good things, and to doe evill things? Doth it agree with the integrity of honest men, yea of heathens themselves, to kisse vvith the mouth, and to vvound vvith the hand? As you speake, so doe; for you shall not be judged by your vvords, but by your deeds.</P>
<P>You promise us not to suffer that any Weapons, or warlike Ammu∣nition, shall be transported against us; and yet notwithstanding, even after the date of this resolution, and the promises made in a State-way to the Parliament, divers ships did arrive from your Quarters at <HI>New∣castle,</HI> laden with all sorts of vvarlike Ammunition; and others sailing that way, did in their voyage fall into the hands of the Parliament and more are daily fraught and sent away. I know vvell enough what usu∣ally against this is pretended by way of excuse, <HI>viz.</HI> That it ariseth from the covetousnesse of the Merchants, who have a thousand sleights to doe this covertly, which cannot well be hindred in a land of Trafficke, such as yours is: But (loving Friend) may we easily beleeve that a wise State will solemnly promise to hinder that, which they doe know afore∣hand that they have no power to hinder? Wherefore seeing the Lords the States have made us promises concerning this, wee are able to be∣leeve no lesse but that they be able (if they have but a minde to it) to hinder the often mentioned exportation; and if they doe not this effe∣ctually, it is a sure signe to us that they have no desire to doe it, and so consequently that they goe about to appease us with words. 'Tis true enough, that under colour of merchandizing much fraud is commit∣ted, and that now and then something may covertly be transported; but I am of opinion that both you and all others, men of understanding, will judge with me that it is a hard matter to slinke away with whole Ships loaden before the eye of all the world; and if they doe pretend to transport the Ammunition in Newtrall, or other confederate Coun∣tries, it were easie to set them down such causions, that the goods should only be delivered out in those places and no where else; and if men were
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> but earnest, such exact notice might be taken, and such severe procee∣dings might be taken against prevaricators, or those that should attempt any thing to the contrary as that they would have small courage to at∣tempt any such matters, and that others would take warning by them.</P>
<P>But suppose some fraud might be committed in this particular, yet I doe not thinke that you will use the same excuse, in regard of the Of∣ficers and Souldiers, who are come over against us after the date of the often mentioned resolutions and promises: for I doe not beleeve that amongst you, you doe use to shut up men in chests or cases, coop them up in barrells, or packe them up in baskets, and so send them away closed up and hid: their powder, weapons, and harnesse may in∣deed bee put up in these things, but they themselves doe usually enjoy more aire, and are not accustomed like Spirits to walk invisible. Judge therefore with me, how easie a matter it were (if your mindes were but sincere) to hinder these things. Here you cannot pretend covetous∣nesse, or the prevarication of Merchants for you doe no more drive Merchandise in your Countries with Officers and Souldiers, then we doe in ours; indeed they be a ware current enough but yet they bee of that nature, as that they goe and are managed of themselves, not by way of negotiation, but being directed under the conduct of the highest Powers, who vvith the Centurion in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Gospel have command over them, and are able to <HI>say to this, Goe, and hee goeth; and to the other, Come, and he commeth.</HI></P>
<P>Insomuch as that nothing is more cleare vvho they bee, who accor∣ding to their promise vvere able, and consequently ought to have hin∣dred the comming over of these Officers and Souldiers; for this end Master <HI>Strickla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> did labour hard with the Lords the States, but all in vaine; he gave up a great Register (as he informes the Parliament) of the Officers, as well Captaines, Lievtenants, as Ensignes, and expressed them by their names which came over against us, out of the respective Regiments of the Colonells <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan, Herbert, Goring, Craven;</HI> besides hundreds of well exercised Souldiers, who may every man of them stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for an Officer and are fit to conduct and to rule the Popish Ar∣mies. How much disservice is by this meanes done to the honest party of the Parliament, and how much the Popish troopes are by this means remarkably advanced her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by to frame a well-ordered Army, whereas before they did wander like stragling sheepe without shepheards, and were not much to be feared. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> am not so well able to expresse, but that you may more easily beleeve it And what endevours have you used from time to time, yea at any time, to hinder the passe of these people?
<PB N="15" REF="9"/> do you deale brotherly with us? are these the promises of Newtralitie, and that you would not suffer any people to goe forth against us?</P>
<P>Wee have indeed heard here with what pretences men goe about to palliate these persons offensive and pernitious dealings from those quar∣ters, which are so against the Church of God, both generally and spe∣cially. Namely, that the English Officers use in the winter time, once or so to goe over into <HI>England,</HI> for to visite their friends, to look after their goods, and so to dispatch their owne affaires, and that this can∣not be so narrowly looked into. But I pray you beloved friend, are not these egregious fictions? What probability is there in it, that so many Officers, and so many Souldiers should goe about their owne parti∣cular affaires, and that much about one and the same time, and that their businesse one with another, should just lye at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and not at <HI>London?</HI> Doe the particular affaires of your <HI>Low-Countrey</HI> Souldiers, Cannoneers and Ingineers, who in great numbers sort themselves with them, lye all at <HI>Newcastle?</HI> are they also to visite their friends there? I doe not thinke that they intend to digge Mines and Trenches in the Coale-Pits. Behold how shamefully men sport themselves in this weighty businesse, I thinke that those which use this blew excuse know better in their Consci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nces; which I commit to the Lord, the know∣er of the hearts, who in his time will discover this dissimulation, and will punish it heavily and certainly.</P>
<P>However we have with much contentment tooke notice, that all thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to whom the Government belongs, do not rest themselves satisfi∣ed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his excuse, and that the Lords the States of the <HI>Provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce</HI> of <HI>Holl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> (who wee find to be well affected to the Parliament, and to be earnestly inclined to the Cause of God) have in a speciall manner te∣stified their dislike of it, and taking no contentment in the foresaid bald excuse have tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a very good Resolution in the point, the Extract w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereof sent over by Master <HI>Strickland,</HI> was of la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e communicated unto me, by a Gentleman of the Parliament, which perhaps you your selfe as yet, have not seen, and therefore I thought fitting to send over to you, which sounds as followes.</P>

Souldiers, being in pay of that State, have bin al∣ready and lately embark'd or lie ready to go from some of their harbours for <HI>New∣castle,</HI> to joyne with the Army of the <HI>Papists,</HI> and other Malignant persons in the North quarters of this Kingdome, against the <HI>Parliament;</HI> and to the subversion of the Protestant Religion here, which hath much encouraged that party, and har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned his Majestie to adhere yet to the ill Counsell, which have been the Authors of these publicke troubles, and miseries of this Kingdome and to reject our diverse hum∣ble requests, that His Majestie would be pleased to returne according to the Laws of the Kingdome to his Parliament, and that by their Counsel and advice, our Religion and the Lawes against the wicked plots and designes, which have been a long time a foot, to the subversion of both, and are still intended, to secure, which to bring to passe, we have offered, and are yet still ready to secure his Majesties Person, Reputation, and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, as can be expected of true Christians and faithfull Subjects. Which we solemnly professe be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore Allmighty God to be our reall in∣tention, and hereby long to shew in deed. And that all that same, that is pretended and published to the contrary, as if we should have intended some designes, or put
<PB N="19" REF="11"/> in execution the least thing, that might have tended to the hurt of his person or prejudice of his Soveraignty, proceeds from the false and wicked calumnies of those that are Enemies to the publike peace; wherefore we desire that wise and carefull State, that they will perform those promises, and hinder and prohibite the transporting of Forces, Armes, Moneyes, and other warlike provisions against us: That they will be pleased to search and inquire into the faults and negligence of the Officers, which have permitted so manifold breaches and transgressions: That they will bee pleased to receive with all fit favour all such complaints and Infor∣mations, which concerning that businesse shall be made by Mr. <HI>Strickl nd,</HI> and look upon it not onely as a matter of some loving respect to the Kingdom, but also such a matter that concernes most highly the glory of God, the defence of the Prote∣stant Religion, their owne preservation and liberty. The which (if we are destroy∣ed shall n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t onely be deprived of a favourable and profitable allyance, but also be surrounded wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such enemies, which by the same rules and grounds, by which they have sought our ruine and destruction, will likewise strive by all manner of meanes and practises to destroy them.</P>

<P>THis Declaration was speedily dispatched by the Lords of the Par∣liament, that they might lose no time, and to prevent all grievan∣ces, sent away by an expresse Pinace most speedily rid away for that ve∣ry purpose, to their Messenger Master <HI>Walter Strickland,</HI> residing in the <HI>Hague</HI> for the present, who also did presently deliver up the same to the Lords the States Generall; but alas they did not take such earnest no∣tice of it, as the same was with an especiall zeale and speedy diligence dispatched unto them. I need not here to complaine much, let the Cause it selfe speake, and let all impartiall men judge. Good Lord, what kinde of fruits are these of our intreating and supplications, and of this so zealous a Declaration now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gaine sent a second time, from whence the Parliament had indeed expected some greater and better good things, and more contentment then from the former. But all things are falne out cleane contrary to our hope and expectation, to the wonderment, unsettlement, and griefe of us all. For by divers Informations from good hands, we are informed, that her Majesty our Queene hath caused to be shipped great quantity of all sorts of warlike Ammunition from a Zea D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rp of yours neere the <HI>Hague,</HI> I think they call it <HI>Grev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling,</HI> and that so visibly as that all men did take notice of it, yea the plain Coun∣trimen and Fishers w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re able to feele and perceive it: onely, which in∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d is lamentable they were not able or rather not willing to take no∣tice of it who only had power, and had also undertaken to hinder it: and that all this provision of Money, Weapons and Ammunition might be brought over without any resistance, we doe understand that there
<PB N="20" REF="12"/> was given to her Majesty a considerable number of warlike Ships, well armed, that so under pretence of transporting of her Majesty, for the doing whereof no great store of Ships was necessary, who in respect of her selfe needs not to feare any thing, all the foresaid goods might bee brought over for the assistance of the Papists, and the prejudice of the Reformed Religion and the faithfull Professors of the same.</P>
<P>But O <HI>Netherland,</HI> dost thou not yet see that thou fightest against God and his Anointed, and that therefore you are from the highest Heavens resisted, as sometimes <HI>Sisera</HI> was: did you not about this time finde the hand of God to be heavy against you? Were not the windes and floods of water furious against you? Did not the River <HI>Kison,</HI> I say the River <HI>Kison</HI> roare against you? Were you not threatned with terrible Inun∣dations, and overflowings of water? Were not (when before this time you were busie about this worke) your Ships in great numbers taken by your enemies, and now againe divers Ships through formidable storms and foule weather broken in pieces, which did belong to this last Fleet of the Queene, and others wholly untackled and saved with much ex∣tremity? Well, what doe you meane? doe you thinke all this to hap∣pen by chance after this order? Shall God so sensibly strike you, and will you ever remaine unsensible? Friends! lay it to heart, and be assu∣red, if you doe not feare the Lord when he gnawes you like a Cancer-worme, he will once meet you as a Lion and a Beare who are berest of their young. If you doe not heed the drisling of Gods chastisements, yet be at least afraid of his tempest. God sometimes sends Grashoppers and Lice, but when this profits not, then he hath also a Red Sea for to swallow up stupid people altogether.</P>
<P>There was sent over to us the Copie of a Pasport given to her Maje∣sty of Great Britaine, by the High and Mighty the Lords the States Generall, which in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgement is so framed, as that by vertue of it, any thing may be put in practice against us, what the Malignants shall have a minde to. My ayme is for to convince you, and clearly to de∣monstrate to all impartiall men, that we are very evilly dealt withall, and therefore I have herewithall sent you a Copy of the said Pasport, which is word for word with that which we have here with us, and it sounds as followes.</P>

<P>Well my friend what doe you think of such a Pasport? Is it not most artificially framed to serve turnes? And lest you imagine that I goe too far, and take up this matter too high, give me leave a little more to dis∣dismember this Pasport.</P>
<P>First, it is granted to her Majesty that she may transport not only all her baggage, but also all her goods, of what kinde soever they might be: what doe you thinke may not under this generall and unlimited Li∣cence be conveniently understood, all sorts of Ammunition which be∣long to her Majesty? for where all sorts of goods are allowed of, there these can be no more excluded then others; wherefore if men would have gone a safe way to work and have prevented fraud, with reverence be it spoken, some restrictions or limitations ought to have been joyn∣ed to this, <HI>viz.</HI> this, that by such expressions were not understood any warlike Ammunition, or such like things, by which meanes dull peo∣ple would more clearly have apprehended the meaning.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>
<P>Secondly, it is granted to her Majestie, That she may transport all these foresaid goods along by all the Chanels of your Countries, such as are the <HI>Tessel,</HI> the <HI>Maes, Goree-gat,</HI> or <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> respectively. Pray let us judge righteous judgement, and not conten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our selves with trifles: may not this conveniently serve to transport a good deale of Ammuni∣tion, under pretence of her Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esties goods, somewhat out of the eye of au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horitie? The <HI>Maes</HI> or at the utmost <HI>Gorei-gat</HI> were the only Chanels out of which her Majesties baggage was probably to be exported: but pray doe so much as tell me, to what purpose there is mention made of the <HI>Vessel,</HI> or of <HI>Wicling?</HI> it were cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainly very inconvenient for to trans∣port her Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esties baggage from the <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue</HI> towards <HI>North-Holland,</HI> or <HI>Zeland,</HI> (passing by more convenient and neerer Havens) that from thence th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y might be shipped towards England: unlesse happly the Se∣cretary to the Lords the States, whose name is subscribed to it, and who in all likelihood drew up this Pasport did by a miraculous influence foresee that her Majesty or some of her Ships might perchance through stormes or contrary winde, be driven in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o other Chanels then they sai∣led out of, and ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore would in time make some good provision a∣gainst it; yet here at <HI>London</HI> we cannot beleeve that it was thus framed out of any such provident resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct.</P>
<P>Thirdly, this transportation is granted to her Majestie not only du∣ring the time of her departure but also after her d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>parture out of your Lands. Who now can be so blinde h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re as not to see, that by these words a doore is set op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n not onely boldly to commit this foresaid fraud at this time, but even some yeares and daies after her Majesties departure, yea as long as it shall please her. For such a consent as is not limited to any time, may conveniently be extended to all times; seeing six or seven yeares are as well after her Majesties departure, as we may speak so of one day af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</P>
<P>Fourthly besides Sackes, Packs Chests, Coffers, Cases, there is also mention made of Tuns, and all these are prohibited to be visited or to be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesse to be opened, under what covert or pretence so∣ever it might be. Doe but tell me whether any thing coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more fa∣vourably have been framed, for the promoting of her Majesties designe of bringing ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r all sorts of Ammuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion unlesse the transportation of Weapons had beene openly yeelded unto? The five first sort of vessels are used by us for to packe up baggage in but we doe very seldome im∣ploy Tuns to that purpose, which are more often used by us to barrell up Herr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs Fish and such like things as also Gunpowder then to pack up cloathes, or such like baggage and yet notwithstanding the words of
<PB N="23" REF="13"/> this pasport lie so favourably, that though the Searchers or the Overseers of the Convoy should see before their eyes, that many hundred Tonnes of Gun-powder should be shipped in for her Majesty, yet by virtue of the forementioned pasport with their eyes open they would be blind: for they have as little leave to visite, or to search, much lesse to open the Tunnes, as the Sackes and Packes, although they should be able to ground their pretence upon this, that they did see the Gun-pow∣der spill out of them.</P>
<P>Behold this is the condition of this pasport, doe you judge your selfe whether I doe wrest and force the words, and whether they may not conveniently be inter∣preted and understood so as we have said. I will not say that the Lords the States generall aimed at the favouring of the Queene, to the prejudice of the Parliaments righteous cause, contrary to their reiterated promises; I have sufficiently under∣stood that amongst them there be many good Lords, who are well-affected from their hearts to the welfare of your Countrey, and of the Church of God in the same, and so consequently also to the just cause of the Parliament; nor will I accuse their Secretary for going beyond his Commission, indulging too much to his Pen, or perfidiously to have studied so to frame the pasport, that it might be misused by her Majesty according to her wish and contentment; and yet in the meane while, in case any good Lords should have misliked it, might by some probable glosse bee well explained and interpreted. Charity doth not easily thinke amisse: Whether this be either so or so, I cannot say.</P>
<P>But this I can say, that we have obtained certaine and divers informations from <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> from whence we doe understand that pasport to be used, or rather abu∣sed, much after the way that I have set downe in my former conceptions; more specially, that at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Delfe</HI> haven there bee fraughted away in <HI>New-castle</HI> ships, many hundred barrels of Gun-powder, Bullets, Morters, and all sorts of Military Ammunition, not covertly (as formerly) but at noone day, before the eye of all the world, and that without any mans gain-saying, because it goes all un∣der the name of her Majesties baggage and goods, (as indeed it is one kind of her goods, whereof all sorts are permitted to be transported) therefore though men see before their eyes that it be Bullets, Gun-powder, and such like warlike Ammuni∣tion, yet by vertue of the often mentioned pasport, men will not looke after it: for by the said pasport it is forbidden to visite, or to search, much lesse to open any of her Majesties baggage and goods of what sort soever, upon what covert or pretence soever.</P>
<P>Behold these bee the fruits of this pasport, which wee indeed did feare, and not without reason did apprehend would fall out so, so soone as the same came into our hands: wherefore many Gentlemen of the Parliament here, did most exceed∣ingly wonder at it, to behold that the Lords the States generall (who had made them such good promises of neutrality and circumspection) should have granted such an equivocating pasport: let men say of the intention what they will, we doe not desire, neither can we judge of the hearts, that is a worke belonging to God, who one day will doe it according to truth and righteousnesse: but this wee say, that to us it is almost all one, whether men in reference to us have a good or a bad intention, when they doe so order their actions. as that from them we in all pro∣bability
<PB N="24" REF="14"/> can expect nothing but bad fruits. And therefore it is not without reason doubted amongst us, which of the two doe more prejudice to our honest cause, yea to the cause of God, whether they who doe transport the weapons, by which the Popish Army doth with all force endevour to destroy the reformed Religion here in <HI>England,</HI> and the Confessors thereof; or they which doe grant such equi∣vocating pasports, by vertue whereof the Malignants doe undertake to doe it boldly.</P>
<P>Beloved friend, whether these proceedings which are used against us, can sub∣sist, all things being cast up, with an upright minde, gratitude, and mercifulnesse, whereunto your Nation is plentifully obliged to ours, I will referre it to the judg∣ment of all impartiall men. Read that over and over againe, and compare and ballance that with one another which we have formerly set downe, and what doth it amount to? Though I should not speake a word, the nature of the cause would convince you.</P>
<P>I have said it, and I say it againe, that men deale not sincerely with us; good things are promised to us, and in the meane while ill things are suffered to be done to us, brotherly words are given to us, and from thence wee get nothing but con∣trary deeds: Neutrality, yea all kinde of friendship is promised to us, and in the meane while we are assaulted from your Quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers with hostile attempts: Certain∣ly, if in these misfortunes which are befallen us, we might have feared any oppres∣sion, in sound judgement we might have misdoubted <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> as having a Religion, and for the most part the same Maximes, by which our enemies here are led; but from you our brethren, professors of the same Faith, we had not at any hand expected any evill. And yet notwithstanding, behold, when <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> stand still you doe shew your selves earnest to promote our ruine, so that here we must complaine with the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> and say, <HI>'I was not an enemy that re∣proathed me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me that did magnifie him∣selfe against me, then I would have hid my selfe from him; But it was thou, O man, mine equall, my guide, and my acquaintance, we tooke sweet counsell together. Amasa</HI> with a sa∣lute was surprized by <HI>Ioab;</HI> Christ with a kisse was betrayed by <HI>Iudas.</HI> I will not say that in all things wee have thus perfectly been dealt withall. or are thus dealt withall by you; but this I doe wish that long agoe you had told us what you were resolved to permit of to our prejudice, that having warning of it, we might in time have provided our selves against it; or else that with more deeds and effects you had verified your protestations of affection and friendship. Certainly the experience of your daily Convoy of Money, People, and Ammunition, for the oppressing of us, is so great and so cleare, as that all pious men do most heartily grieve for it, who in time of distresse had expected and hoped for some other manner of comfort from you, <HI>viz.</HI> that if they should (which God of his mercy prevent) be here subdued, they might amongst you finde a receptacle, and a place of refreshing from the heat of persecution: but now wee doe almost apprehend what wee are, to build upon those, who so unseasonably joining themselves to our enemies doe though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di∣rectly, yet effectually helpe to oppresse us. Are these the rewards of our faithful∣nesse shewed to you in the times of your grievances? when no men did bewaile you or pity you, but when you were sufficiently forsaken by all the world, we had
<PB N="25" REF="14"/> compassion on you, we have been a Harbour to your exiled and flying Ancestors, we did friendly embrace them in our armes, give them dwellings amongst us, yeelded eminent Priviledges unto them, which did so sweetly allure them, as that they have sought to plant their generation amongst us, even as their posterities do unto this day make up stately Dutch Churches at <HI>London, Norwich, Colchester, Sand∣wich, Yarmouth, Maydstone,</HI> and in other places amongst us: and is this now your reward, that you seek to destroy your Harbour, and to make a Wildernesse of it, and a Habitation for Dragons? Wee have assisted you with remarkable Summes of Money, which your Inhabitants of <HI>Flissing, Briel,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Rammekins,</HI> are able to testifie, and instead of thankefulnesse and Interest, shall your Money be sent over, for to set our enemies upon their leggs, and to helpe throw us under foot, and to spoile us? Wee have sent over our people to you in whole Regiments for to helpe together with you to defend your beloved wives and deare Children, your Lawes, Priviledges and Liberties; Yea your Religion, and the Reformed Worship of God, and shall reap no other Harvest from these Offices of fidelitie, then that in spite of our teeth, you should send forth our Countrey-men against us for the help and assistance of those enemies, who as in former time they did most tyrannically seek to bereave you of all these, so they doe now adaies labour to bereave us of them?</P>
<P>In their first Declaration the Parliament did certifie the high and mighty Lords the States Generall of their earnest desire, for to enter into a more close Alliance with your State, that by this means they might make themselves and you stronger, against the common enemies of the Reformed Church of Christ: Yea how much they doe lay that point to their hearts, they doe declare sufficiently, seeing they have made this point one of the most considerable Articles of Peace, which they have propounded to His Majesty, and is your helpe to our enemies and the Ene∣mies of God the expression of your love to us againe? Doe you thus lay the foun∣dations of such an Alliance which your State and ours, so necessarie and profitable for whole Christendome and Gods Churches in the same?</P>
<P>It is no longer agoe then the last Summer, that we did not onely suffer, but, If I may speake it, give you warning and consented to it, that you should take tenne of our English Ships, which had thought to runne into <HI>Dunkirke</HI> from under the conduct of our Man of Warre, and to bring them up to <HI>Flushing;</HI> Cordially af∣fecting, which yet by the Lawes of our Kingdome, is not as yet prohibited amongst us, that you should seaze upon that which was conveyed over to your enemies, and will you now so requite this, as to afford Convoy of all sorts of Ammuniti∣on against us, contrary to your owne Order and expresse promises made unto us, that if it were possible wee might all helpe to break the necks of one another.</P>
<P>If I should relate the faithfull assistance, the brotherly love, and the unwearied mercie, which our Nation at all times, but especially at the time of your lamenta∣ble Commotions, did shew to your Nation, I might sooner be able to begin then to make an end, and in this might easily loose my selfe, aske your Fathers, and they will tell you with <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> do you peruse your Chronicles and Histories, and you will quickly find what good <HI>Mordechai</HI> hath done you, how then are you able thus to oppresse his posterity? Did not the Religious Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> like a second
<PB N="26" REF="15"/> <HI>Hester,</HI> helpe ridde your Fore-fathers out of the clawes and blood-thirstie power of the proud Spanish <HI>Haman,</HI> with sufficient hazard of her owne Crowne and Kingdomes? How comes it about then, that you doe thus set your selves against the English Nation? assisting the enemies of that Religion the love whereof sent help from Her to you? O unthankfullnesse! unseemly before men, detestable a∣mongst <HI>Heathens,</HI> unsufferable amongst <HI>Christians,</HI> abominable before God; If those are lyable to punishment from the Lord, who requite not good with good, yea if wee are to recompence the evill of our enemies with love and well doing, with prayers and blessings: what judgement then doe you thinke may those ex∣pect, who reward evill for good; and do so lamentablie grieve their friends, yea, their Brethren?</P>
<P>Where is that mercy, which in this case you are bound to shew to your friends and allies, not onely in respect of an outward Alliance, but also in respect of that Covenant of Grace, made in our Saviour Jesus Christ? We are in a lamentable fire, by vertue whereof wee are daily more and more consumed, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his your mercie, rather to bring oyle then water to the flames, we are especially persecuted, because wee labour to drive out from amongst us Idola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous Popery: and will you by helping of our enemies labour to bring in amongst us againe? O <HI>Netherland!</HI> wee doe endeavour to throw downe the high places of <HI>Baal,</HI> will you now be the Instruments, by which the same might be bulit up againe? All that wee aime at, is to purge the flower of Gods Church amongst us, from the remaining superstiti∣ous chaffe of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and will you helpe and bolster up those, who more then ever seek to cast in more by whole handfulls? wee wish from our hearts that wee might be conformable, and brought nearer to you and other reformed Churches, in the manner of serving of God, and will you thus strengthen those who doe seek to make us more deformed, and labour to bring us farther from you? The Lord knows our hearts the most and the only thing that we have in our eye, is in∣deed Reformation in Politique affaires, and the great oversights committed therein, but especially of the mis-made Church amongst us. Doe but behold and consider the Articles of Peace delivered over to his Majestie by the Parliament, that we might once at last get out of our miserable misunderstandings of one another, you will find that most of them tend to the destruction of the Kingdome of Antichrist, and for the firme establishment of the points concerning the true Reformed Chri∣stian Religion: for this we are persecuted by whole Popish Armies (levied by the expresse Act of the Kings) and for the most part Armed by you, who wheresoe∣ver they doe domineere, do begin already to extirpate the Reformed Religion, and to plant Popery instead of it; as to this purpose, on the 30th of <HI>Ianuary</HI> last there was openly read in the Parliament, and by order of the same printed a Letter from the Lord <HI>Fairfax.</HI> In which his Lordship doth write these following words. <Q><HI>In Yorke where many Recusants are resident, Masse is ordinarily performed in all streets, and the Pro∣testants and their serving of God so affronted, as that few dare goe to Church: in other quar∣ters of the Land (as I am informed) the Religious farre and neare are either fled or taken, which persecutions if in time they are not stopped, they will either altogether extirpate the Protestant Religion out of these quarters, or at least greatly oppresse it.</HI></Q> Do but see by how many sorts of wiles, and by what power our holy purpose is opposed: behold the
<PB N="27" REF="15"/> Lions and the Tygers, with whom we doe wrestle; behold the travailing Woman, the amiable and beloved Spouse of Christ, which is forced to flee into the Wilder∣nesse because of the persecution of the Red Dragon and many of her members in divers quarters of this Kingdome are by these Popish murtherers so miserably wounded, that a Samaritan stranger would pitty her, bind up her wounds, and powre oyle and wine into them, and will you <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Levites,</HI> people of one Religion with us. passe by us without any compassion, and suffer us to lye halfe dead? But would to God you did onely passe by us, and did not put the Sword into these murtherers hands by which they have pittifully wounded us, and be∣ing halfe dead, might farther labour to cut our throats? Friends, consider what you have to doe. Judgement shall proceed without mercie, against those that shew no mercie, how formidable then shall Judgement be against those, who have been unmercifull, and that against their Brethren, who after a sort, that wee may so say, shall have whet the knife, to cut the throats of their confederates in the Faith.</P>
<P>VVould you in time of your troubles, when as the Papists, in your native coun∣trey began to advance themselves against the reformed Religion, have been con∣tent to have sided with the Papists; have given them weapons into their hands, and have provided for them all sorts of necessaries, to have massacred the professors of the reformed Religion? would you not thinke them that should doe so, to be open enemies and persecutors of Gods Church? Friend, you doe passe a sentence against your selves as sometimes <HI>David</HI> did before <HI>Nathan,</HI> for you do erre grosly if you take the Churches of God in <HI>England</HI> to be another then your owne: the Arti∣cles of your Faith do teach you, that there is but one holy Catholike Church though divided into severall Congregations. This is the mother of all the children of God, whose head is in Heaven, and her body upon the face of the whole earth, therefore to help persecute the Churches in <HI>England,</HI> is as much as to persecute the universall Church, and to lessen her in one of her members. O more then unnaturall worke! that you should helpe to oppresse her, whom you acknowledge to be your Mother, and whose children you boast your selves to be! O most lamentably distructed bo∣dy, in which the members doe advance themselves one against another! O, how came the Divell by this power, that he should be able to stirre up the Kingdome of Jesus Christ against it selfe, that taking away the paines from the common ene∣mies, they should mutually bite and destroy one another! O you witlesse people, doe you see what you doe? Doe you know that by these doings you make us and your selves unfitting to withstand our common enemie? You are yet in a reaso∣nable good condition, but how soone can the generall resolution of almost whole Christendome, come to you also, and bring you into great inconveniences? what help and comfort then can you expect from us, whom you have formerly so noto∣riously weakned, and helped to ruine us by your unchristian assistance?</P>
<P>The first Mottoes of your Liberty ought to make you wiser: you were wont to say, <HI>Concordia res parvae crescunt;</HI> or which is much at one, <HI>Vnity makes might;</HI> Your Lion (who holds seven shafts fast bound together in his clawes) should have taught you your bounden duty, in such a case, for what else doe you signifie thereby, but that as loose and unbounden shafts are fraile, and may easily be broken one after
<PB N="28" REF="16"/> another, whereas being bound together they will hold out against any Force: even so powers, though they be small, yet being joyned together they are formidable; yea, may easily be made invincible: was it not then in the prosecution of your own tenent, that you endevoured in convenient time to joine your complaints with those of your brethren, that being closer united to them, you might jointly resist the Romish Antichrist, that Whore, which is drunke with the bloud of the Saints and the Martyrs of Jesus, who doth persecute you, one with another, by the weapons of the Kings of the earth, whom shee hath given to drinke out of the Wine of the Cup of her Fornication? At least it was incompatible and altogether inconsistent with the nature of the Communion of the Saints, for you to use your powers for the weakning of those of your brethrens, and if it were possible, for the breaking of them quite and cleane to pieces.</P>
<P>It was sometimes, in the times of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> a fearfull voice from the Angel of the Lord, <HI>Curse ye Meroz, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the helpe of the Lord, to the helpe of the Lord against the Mighty.</HI> But what curses doe you not thinke are conceived against you, for to be denounced, and in time to be executed upon you, who not onely did come to helpe the Lord, but on the contrary, did helpe the enemies against the Lord? Remember <HI>Amalek,</HI> what became of him, and was done to him? when the children of <HI>Israel</HI> did passe over the Red Sea, and being wearied did thinke to finde some rest, then <HI>Amalek</HI> came forth and strove against him: But what saith the Lord to <HI>Moses? Write this for a memoriall in a booke, and rehearse it in the eares of I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shua, for I will utterly put out the remem∣brance of Amalek from under heaven, Exod.</HI> 17.14. <HI>Moses</HI> dyes, but the Lords Register continues still in being; it runs on a long time, yea an hundred yeares together be∣fore this sentence of the Lord is put in execution: God desers it till the times of <HI>Saul,</HI> but the greatnesse of divine vengeance the weight of the punishment, did re∣compence to the full the delaying of the sentence with their totall and finall ruine: unto <HI>Saul</HI> then it is said, <HI>Now goe and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, oxe and sheep, camell and asse,</HI> 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.3. Alas, who would not tremble at the relation of so severe a vengeance? who would not quake that shall take notice, that after the revolution of so many ages, the wickednesse of the fathers is visited upon the children; that the children, yea the sucking children, the small with the great, yea the beasts themselves are involved in the selfe-same mischiefes? Give me leave to tell you, that you have dealt no better with us then <HI>Amalek</HI> did with the <HI>Israelites:</HI> we were weary, because of the continuall wrestlings with the secret wiles, and publike force of our enemies; and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then you come to fight with us, and to disturbe our rest, through the side of those, who aime at nothing but our perdition, &amp; at yours too in convenient time. Yea, I will say more, and maintaine <HI>Amalek</HI> to have been more excusable then you, and your fault to be greater then theirs: <HI>Amalek</HI> had none of the feare of God, nor knew nothing of God; but you make profession to know him: Hee had no Covenant with <HI>Israel,</HI> but you have a double Allyance with us. VVe are your Brethren, Children of one Father, and one Mother. We call upon one God, in the Name of one and the same Mediatour Jesus Christ: We professe one Faith, One Religion, and have one Baptisme. You doe not sinne through ig∣norance
<PB N="29" REF="16"/> as did <HI>Amaleck.</HI> VVhat are you then to expect, but that the wrath of God will once kindle more heavily against you? which will loosen and untwist the foundations of your state? Doe not thinke that you stand so sure, though as yet you seeme to be something; the Popish Serpent in your bosome, the lapses in your Po∣licy, the fines amongst you so enhansed, the Militia so unruly, envy, and state, Am∣bition so much reigning amongst you, Corruptions so common, your inestima∣ble and so much lamented losses at Sea, which you have but lately sustained (con∣cerning all which wee heare the reports daily with sorrow) doe not these ex∣presly foretell you that your State begins to totter, and will certainly fall downe, in short time, if the Lord from heaven doe not prevent it. And whensoever pro∣ceeding as you doe, that shall once certainly fall upon you, what comfort will you then finde with God, against whom you have fought by his enemies? what comfort with us your brethren, whom you have helped to ruinate? yea, with your owne conscience, which then in the remembrance of that which now you doe without remorse. will lamentably gnaw you, and being convicted will make you confesse, that it is righteous with God to recompence oppression to the oppressors? In all likelihood you may now cast all this behind your backe, but the time may come quickly, in which difficulties pressing upon you, the folly and perversnesse of your spirit might be more discovered, and cause you (though too late) with the brethren of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> to complaine to one another, and say, <HI>We are verily guilty concer∣ning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soule, when he besought us, and we would not heare; therefore is this distresse come upon us.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you have, <HI>my beloved friend,</HI> the complaints of our Nation over you, which make us groane and cry out to God in the highest Heaven because of you, and not to be a little solicitous over you, that the threatned and righteous woe will one time or other come up∣on you. If I have spoken somewhat earnestly, and now and then somewhat affectionately, do you take it in good part from me, and be assured that I am not transported with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny par∣ticular passion, but with an upright zeale for to defend truth and innocency; yea, that all hath proceeded from an unfained love to the welfare of the Church of God, and Polity, not onely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mongst u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but also amongst you.</P>
<P>I have not complained against the Commons of <HI>Netherland,</HI> whom we know out of a de∣sire to the prosperity of the Kingdome of Christ, to be fully addicted to our cause; nor is my Letter <HI>directed</HI> against the Lords the States of your particular Provinces: they are our f iends. <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> have declared it openly, we expect no lesse from the rest, when∣soever time and occasion shall but present themselves, for to declare themselves farther. Nor have we any thing against the high and aspectable Colledge of the Lords the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es Generall; we know that there sit among them many godly lovers of his truth, who have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so still made us good promises, the effects whereof we hope to reape more and more. But we complaine upon those, who for private lucre do transport the said things to our enemies, and of those in governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who being carried with private interests, know how to carry matters so cunningly, that the wholesome order of the Land cannot be put in execution, but the contrary be stoutly practised without punishment. I suspect your State in this par∣ticul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to be no happier then ours, and the most in the world; and that the most noble members of your asp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctable Colledge have also their boyles, wens, and hurtfull excrescen∣cies, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n time ought by the soveraigne power of your Provinces to be pierced, cut off, and taken away, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you will not run the hazard shortly to perish one with another.</P>
<P>Wherefore I doe request that you would communicate this my Letter to your knowne
<PB N="30" REF="17"/> friends, or rather (if you shall so judge fitting) to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke it common in Print to all. Not to stir up commotions and sedit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, the Lord knowes my heart, (if any man should so con∣strue my writing, he would force my intention) but only to affore a Manuduction, that all the foresaid disorders comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tted against u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, together with the heavy consequences of them, might once through good order be remedied and prevented. Which whensoever I shall by my writing have attained unto, I do professe to have gained the only aime which I had pro∣posed to my selfe. But if I, my native-countrey, and yours, and Gods Church in both, should prove so unhappy, that my w iting should occasion more exacerbation then amendment, and you should resolve to continue your former assistance to Gods and our enemies; yet notwithstanding we do in the maintenance of Gods righteous quarrell, only through his help in the use of all good meanes, which his mercy doth as yet richly afford unto us both from within and from without, in time to become more then conquerours. And if it should otherwise fall out, that by reason of our sins we should be conquered, and our weaknesse should chance to fall under the powers which are against us, and are so notoriously strength∣ned by you, the Lord then will indeed be found irreprov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able in his wayes, and righteous in his judgements, which a thousand times over we have deserved; but as for men, we shall die in our integrity, and heaven and earth shall witnesse for us, that you most unrighteously have helped to destroy us. We shall have this rest in our consciences, that we die in the maintenance of Gods truth, and the defence of his deere bought Church. You on the con∣tary either falling into trouble together with us, or some while after us, will every way feele in your consciences that gnawing worme, which will never suffer you to take rest, but alwayes convince you, that you have helped to rend the Church, and sent your weapons to the destruction of his inheritance. Our gracious God be so good to you, that you may bee led by another spirit, unto whom I doe also pray from the bottome of my heart, that he would prosper you so long as you aime at his honour, and in pursuance of your Christian calling seeke to preserve his little Flocke, and endevour to build up the walls of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> as well within as without your Coun∣tries. Farewell. From <HI>London</HI> the 13. of <HI>February</HI> 1643.</P>
