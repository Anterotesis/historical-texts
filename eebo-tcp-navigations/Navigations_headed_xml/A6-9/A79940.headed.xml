<DIV2 N="Dieppe" TYPE="place">
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>IEPPE,</HI> a Town, but indifferently Forti∣fied, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dieppe.</NOTE> the Walls old, has an ancient Fort that commands the Port, and a Castle of the same Date, that does the like to the Land: The Harbour pretty safe, but very small: The little Trade they have, is Fish, yet most of it comes from <HI>Rye, Hastings,</HI> &amp;c. Is worse built than <HI>Calice;</HI> has several Monasteries, and a Preschè (as they call it) or Hugenots Church, which has a very great Congregation.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="Rouen" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>ROUEN,</HI> A large Timber-built Town, not much un∣like <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE> <HI>London</HI> within the Walls, before the Fire; The Scituation within Hills, that hang over it on every side; has a good Wall on three parts of it, and the River <HI>Seine</HI> on the other, which there is pretty large, the Tyde rising in it to a considerable heighth, so that great Vessels come up to the Quay, which is the most beautiful Street it has, being broad, and just the length of the Town: The River formerly had a Stone Bridge, and some of the Arches are still remaining, but its ra∣pidity and the great shoales of Ice destroyed it: At present, it has a Bridge of 19. large Boats, which is the most extraordinary thing in <HI>France,</HI> and a Duty on Merchandize maintains it: Beyond the River is a place set with some Trees, where the Ladies in the E∣venings make their Tour: It has a Parlement, is an Arch-Bishops Seat, has 70. Churches and Monasteries, and 32. Parishes; Their best Ghurch was built by the <HI>English,</HI> and their finest Monastery is now of English Women: It is esteemed to have in it 600000. Souls; by which crowd of Sluttish People, ill Scituation, and narrow Streets, it is most abominable filthy: It has an ill favour'd Bourse, hung with ugly Pictures of their French Kings; a small Trade for all sorts of Merchan∣dize, but the most considerable Commodity is English Lead: The Country thither, indifferent Fertile and Plea∣sant, most of it Corn, with some scatter'd Woods, Copses, and Apple Trees set in order on every side the Road, which serves in lieu of Vines.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="PARIS" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>PARIS,</HI>Is a great City, yet not above half as big <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paris.</NOTE> as <HI>London;</HI> the Building high, most of Stone, the Streets narrow, the Windows, Doors, and Shops, not very good; the Paving inconvenient for Horses at all times, and men in moist weather; being of large slip∣pery
<PB REF="3"/> stones of near a foot broad; has abundance of Pa∣laces which have no back Yards, nor stately Entrance; their Coaches stand in the Court, and their Stables under their Lodgings; their Rooms of State, all with the deformity of great unproportion'd Timber appearing on the Ceilings, nor excus'd by gilding, and the Churches neither beautiful nor neat: The River <HI>Seine</HI> runs through part of it, but is there so shallow, that it serves for nothing in the Summer but to wash their Cloaths, which they do upon long flat Boats: The Scituation is upon a level, excepting a little assent at the East∣end; the Air so good, that it was never known to have the Plague, though there be ill Scents enough to make it continually suspected: The principal Traffick of this City, is, their Language, Dancing, Fencing and Riding-Masters, Babies, Toyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with which they supply all Europe, yet have enough left for their own use.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="LOUURE" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>LOUURE,</HI> Has only one end, and one side of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Louure.</NOTE> it finish'd; and when the rest shall be added, will be one of the most extraordinary Pallaces in the World, both as to its Greatness and Figure, not any in <HI>Italy</HI> resembling it in either: Behind it is the great Gar∣den of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> which is near half as long as St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park: Is prettily planted with Firr-Trees, Cypress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and would be very fine, were they grown up, and that it had Gravel-Walks. Beyond this, is the <HI>Cour de la Reyne,</HI> a place by the River-side, set with Trees about a Mile long, like the great Walk in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park; wherein the Coaches take the Air in the Evening, and with some jostling, pass and turn, there being in the middle, and at the end, round places for that purpose. The end of the <HI>Louure</HI> has this Prospect, wherein is the Kings own Appartment,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> which contains these Rooms; Guard-Chamber, Ante-Chamber, Dressing-Room, Bed-Chamber, a Closet for Private Councel, another for Devotions, a large Cham∣ber for his Toys or Bijous, a Room built Gallery-wise to give Audience to Embassadors, a grand Sall for Ballets, and a Chamber for Comedies, with Theatre and Benches: Upon the same Floor is the Queens Appartment, which in every respect is as rich and large; but has one Room more, which is a Bed-Chamber distinct, for them to lye together; Under these (the Ground-Chambers) is the <HI>Dauphins,</HI> which are the same with those above: In these Lodgings there is much Gilding and Painting, Cabbinets of Eb∣bony, inlay'd with Brass-Work, some Statues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In one of the lower Rooms, is all the Models of the Towns in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> with their exact For∣tifications, Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In another, are ten thou∣sand Poppits, representing so many <HI>French</HI> Souldiers for the <HI>Dauphin</HI> to exercise, being made to turn and charge at Pleasure: To this, which makes one side of the <HI>Louure,</HI> is a Gallery about 800. yards long, and 10 broad, seeming to have been design'd for a Sumptuous Rope-House, and as such the Architecture Merits praise; under it are the Kings Stables, conve∣niently plac'd for the River.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="GARDEMEUBLE" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>GARDEMEUBLE,</HI> In the <HI>Old Louure,</HI> is the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardemeu∣ble.</NOTE> great Ward-robe kept, wherein are several Rich Beds, Canopies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his extraordinary Chair of State, the glorious Rigging of his great Ship, Damask Sails em∣broider'd with Gold, and Cordage suitable, Hangings for the exceeding long Gallery, many great pieces of white Plate, two large Cisterns us'd for Baptizing of the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> 24. mighty Dishes or Basons for Cup-Boords, 24. for Orenge-Trees, as many for Perfuming,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> two Candle-sticks of prodigious heighth and weight; se∣veral Stands near as big; 24. great frames for fruit and Banquets; a great Table with Figures emboss'd upon it of the Chariot of the Sun, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some great Ewres, with other Plate of less weight and show, but none of Gold: Next to this is a little Armory, where the most remarkable suite of Armes is that, was given the King by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> very finely engraved with the Figures and Prospects of the Conquer'd Towns in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> &amp;c. Is exceeding light, yet Musquet proof, as appears by the dint in it; there is besides several strange Weapons, Armour of <HI>China,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="ARCH TRYUMPHAL" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>ARCH TRYUMPHAL,</HI> Of Wood, and painted; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arch Try∣umphal.</NOTE> but the exact Model of what is intended to be in Marble; in beauty exceeding any of the Ancient <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> erected by this present great Emperor of <HI>France,</HI> in honour of himself; upon which is to stand his fa∣mous Statue by <HI>Bernino</HI>'s hand.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="GOBLINS" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>GOBLINS,</HI> A House built for the Kings Artificers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Goblins.</NOTE> such as Inlayers of Cabinets, Statuaries, Sculptors, Painters, Silver-Smiths, Tapistry-makers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all which, both great and small, the design is still the Kings Tryumphs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>OBSERVATOIRE,</HI> A Building not quite finish'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Observa∣toire.</NOTE> for the Kings Chymists and Mathematical experiments, which besides the sinking, it has below the Surface of the ground, there is a descent of 171. large steps; which go so low into the Rock, that at one side you meet the River <HI>Seine;</HI> from the bottom of this, by a hole quite through the Building, the Stars may be seen at Noon∣day; round about it are Labratories in two degrees or Stories: The Building is Stone, without any Timber; the Chambers Arch'd as well as the rest; the Quaries
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> just by it, which yield a Stone so soft, that at first digging, they work almost as easie as Wood.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="INVALIDES" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>INVALIDES,</HI> A sumptuous Hospital not quite fi∣nish'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Invalides.</NOTE> design'd for the maim'd Officers of the Army, and is therefore very large; it has two Courts, besides the Out-houses for Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The first is equal to the Building of the Louure it self, and the Quadrangle as big as that of Christ-Church; for to honour it, the King, Queen, Duke, and Dutchess reserve Lodgings to themselves in it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="PLACE-ROYAL" TYPE="place">

<DIV2 N="PONTNUEF" TYPE="place">

<P><HI>FOIRE St. GERMAIN,</HI> A large piece of ground <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foire St. Germain.</NOTE> under an ordinary cover of posts and tyles, divided into eight small Walks, or Streets; and the pleasure and benefit of it, is to cheapen, and then play for a Toy: It belongs to the Abbot, and yields him a very great Rent.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="St. GERMAINS" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>St. GERMAINS,</HI> Has a fine Scituation, but the <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Ger∣mains.</NOTE> House out of fashion; stands upon a Hill, and the River <HI>Sein</HI> running by it; on one side of it a Forrest which is well Wooded, and Pleasant; on the other an agreeable Country of Vineyards and Corn; has but one Court, is not large, nor any Rooms in it excellent; only the Kings Closet is pretty, being lined with Looking-glasses, painted with <HI>Cupids</HI> on them, and what there is of wood, cover'd with Gilding, the Roof being a Cupola, the Glasses very prettily deceive the eye, and the Floar in proportion of beauty to the rest; the Garden not extraordinary, but suitable to the House.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="St. CLOUD" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>St. CLOUD,</HI> A House of Monsieurs, not large, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Cloud.</NOTE> pretty; stands upon a Hill, and the Garden (which is not yet in order) all the way descending to the River∣side, the Cascade very good, which is ow'd to the Sci∣tuation; has a great deal of Wood, but can never have any good Walks.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="RUEL" TYPE="place">
<P><HI>RUEL,</HI> A House so little, that it can only serve <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruel.</NOTE> the King to Collation in; the Gardens and Walks the most &amp; pleasantest in <HI>France;</HI> the whole enclosure of it, being 300. Acres of ground, gives such room for variety, that there are Corn-fields as well as Cascades and Fountains in it.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<P> <HI>VERSAILLE,</HI> Though it seem to be scituate in a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Versaille.</NOTE> hole, being overlook'd on every side with Hills, yet ne∣vertheless stands on a little rising ground; the Front has wings, which by a new addition, are become much too long for the body; 'tis stone, colour'd as brick; not high, and cover'd with blew slate; the ridge with Iron gilded, which lyes on each side in Flowre-de luces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Between the Windows little heads in niches; and for yet greater Ornament, the Roof is adorn'd with Pinacles; to approach the Door, there are two ascents of Marble Diamond cut; on the last a little gilded jette d'eau; and in each corner, at the setting on of the wings, two gilded Vollerys, or Cages, stuck against the Wall like Martins Nests: It affords not above three Appart∣ments; the Kings, the Queens, and Dauphins; has some rich Furniture, and much painting; but his Majestys Bed-Chamber is most Bizzare, being meubl'd principally with Purslain, which it has in greater quan∣tity and variety than any Potters Shop in <HI>Europe;</HI> ad∣joyning to this, and the Queens Appartment, is a Terrase pav'd with Marble, supported with Pillars, and a Bason in the mid'st of it: The Garden is very large, and being a continued descent from the House, makes that side of it to appear higher, and more beautiful; has many Fountains, Basons, Statues, and great Walks, with tall Trees and Hedges; at the lower end a Canal, in which is a Yacht with all her Rigging: The King and all the Court enjoy the pleasure of it in their Coaches; the Deep-loose Sand, rendring it not agreea∣ble to walk in. The Ministers and Nobility have Houses set at some distance on a piece of ground waste like Common.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>The great Market place is large, at least as <HI>Smith∣field,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Il Mercato.</NOTE> stor'd with admirable Provisions of all kinds; but the Pork, Bacon, and Pidgeons so extraordinary, that they seem quite different meats from ours.

<P><HI>Vesuvius</HI> is about nine miles from <HI>Naples,</HI> but by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monte Ve∣suvio.</NOTE> its great heighth, appears very near; the way to it, is all cover'd with Stones burnt into Cinders of all sizes; the Hill it self very steep, cloath'd in Ashes; the sharp top blown away, and a round hole in it, esteem'd a mile wide, which is very deep, but of an equal bore; the sides of it is Rock, the bottom a perfect flat, except the very middle, where it perpetually smoaks, and by its venting there, has rais'd a little Hill, the upper part of which is tipt with Sulphur.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="50"/>
<P> Behind <HI>Naples</HI> is a passage cut through a Mountain, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pausilippo.</NOTE> large enough for two Carts to pass, long at least as the Maille in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, and very high, by which means it is not very dark, the light striking in at each end, a great way; and in the middle of it is a Lamp that hangs there for the Virgins sake, who has our Saviour in her Lap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grotta del Cane,</HI> is a little place cut in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotta del Cane.</NOTE> side of a Hill, where there breaths out from the ground a Vapour of that malignity, that in a moment it kills a Dogg, if his head be held low to it; and they usu∣ally throw him into the Lake <HI>Agnano,</HI> close by, which they say revives them again; but if they hold them too long in the <HI>Grott,</HI> they'l be mistaken, witness a Dog that follow'd me from <HI>Rome.</HI> A Torch held in the same manner, will instantly go out; and in this ex∣periment is seen its force, for hold high, it burns as at other times; but lower and lower, blewer and blewer, till it extinguish; 'Tis kept lockt, least some silly <HI>Ani∣mal</HI> should go into it for shelter, as once a <HI>Pilgrim</HI> did, and died.</P>
<P>The <HI>Solfatara</HI> has Hills round it, and seems to be a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Solfatara.</NOTE> place where a Mountain once stood; the ground is very hot, sounds hollow, and in divers places the Sulphureous smoak issues with great noise and violence: They make Cups and Pots of the Earth, which are us'd Physically, and gather great quantities of <HI>Sal-Armoniack, Nitre, Vitriol,</HI> and other preparations, from this natural La∣bratory.

<P>Near it are the Elizian Fields, a place of no great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elizium.</NOTE> Bliss, yet would have still been <HI>Paradice,</HI> had it not lost its Priests.</P>
<P>The <HI>Piscina Mirabile</HI> is a vast Cave, or Cellar, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Piscina Mi∣rabile.</NOTE> entirely under ground, lined with a plaister as hard as flint, supported with abundance of huge square Pillars, and suppos'd to have been a reserver of Water for the <HI>Roman</HI> Galleys that lay hard by it, in the <HI>Mare Mor∣tuum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cento Camerelle</HI> are a hundred little <HI>Grotta's</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cento Ca∣merelle.</NOTE> in the manner of the former, and for the same pur∣pose, though some say, for to keep Slaves in for the use of the Galleys.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Agrippina</HI>'s sumptuous Villa, the only entire part <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sepolc'r A∣grippina.</NOTE> remaining, is her Tomb, which in a dark hole, amongst the Ruins, by Torch-light may be seen.</P>

<P>The <HI>Sybills Grott</HI> is a large passage, cut in a Hill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotta di Sibilla.</NOTE> like that of <HI>Pausillippus,</HI> and formerly a Rode to <HI>Cuma,</HI> now wall'd up in the middle; about 150. yards with∣in it, there is a streight Entry, which leads to di∣vers little Rooms of several sizes, the one of which has been adorn'd with <HI>Mosaick</HI> work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the fur∣thest, there is a Spring of luke-warm water, which makes it suspected that these Chambers were cut for the sake of that; but being so far from light, or air, then what is suffocating, I cannot guess at the use, or the Inhabitant.</P>
<P>Just before the entrance into this <HI>Grotta,</HI> is the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lago Aver∣no.</NOTE> round Lake <HI>Avernus;</HI> and on the side of it, the Ruins of the Temple to <HI>Apollo,</HI> which is made an Argument, that the above-said Rooms were the Lodgings of a <HI>Si∣bill:</HI> At a little further distance are several scatter'd Ruins, and in the Hills about it, abundance of Baths and Sweating places, esteem'd good for several Dis∣eases; and in the <HI>Romans</HI> time had Statues there e∣rected, that pointed, and Inscriptions that told what part and distemper every Bath was proper for; but the <HI>Salernian</HI> Physicians growing poor by it, went una∣nimously one night and defaced them both.</P>
<P>Further on by <HI>Cuma</HI> is the Lake of <HI>Accheron,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Palude Ac∣cherusia.</NOTE> which now is no more horrid than the former, only its water of worse colour.</P>

<P> The Government of <HI>Naples</HI> is by a Vice-Roy, whose <NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment.</NOTE> Commission is usually for three years, with the allow∣ance of 24000. <HI>Duccats</HI> annually, besides what he fleas off the People: He is assisted by a Privy Coun∣cel, two Secretaries of State, and four Doctors of the Law, called <HI>Regenti della Cancellaria,</HI> which are term'd also his Councellors, and in matters of Impor∣tance, are joyned with the former. Of the same de∣nomination there are likewise two always residing in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and sit in the Councel of <HI>Italy</HI> there, exactly to enform them of the State of <HI>Naples;</HI> and in these, and all Courts of Justice, at least half of them must be <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The City is between eight and nine miles in com∣pass, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength.</NOTE> with Bull-works <HI>alla moderna,</HI> and encloses 300000. Inhabitants, besides Monasteries and Stran∣gers; has an Arsenal and five Castles; a Mole and Squadron of seaven Galleys; a Guard of fifty Horse al∣ways next the person of the Vice Roy; a hundred Hal∣berdiers that Guard in the Pallace; five Troops of light Horse-men, and 4000. Spanish Foot, which are there daily upon Duty likewise, and besides, supply the Castles.</P>
<P>The Kingdom is esteem'd to be 1468. miles in com∣pass; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Garrisons.</NOTE> in all the several Castles of which, and Guards upon the Sea-coasts, there are but 1608. Spanish Foot.</P>

<PB N="100" REF="52"/> same pay with the Spanish Foot. Of these, as well as all other Force in the Kindom, the Vice-Roy is Cap∣tain-General.</P>
<P>The several Provinces have Governors called <HI>Primi</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Governors of Provin∣ces.</NOTE> <HI>Guisticieri,</HI> which are allow'd a Guard of twelve Hal∣berds, but their Governments last but two years.</P>

And in lieu of the Excise and Gabels that were upon all sorts of things necessary to life, it was agreed likewise to give the King 300000. <HI>Duccats</HI> yearly, which is since increas'd 113000. <HI>Duccats</HI> by an ex∣traordinary Imposition on Tabacco, not included in the Covenant, because judg'd a thing not necessary to hu∣mane life. The Imposition on the Sheep and Pastu∣rage in <HI>Apuglia,</HI> amounts to 200000. <HI>Duccats</HI> yearly, And what the King receives in lieu of his Knights Service, or Tenure <HI>d'Adogo,</HI> 100000. yearly, which is all the certain Revenue the Spaniards have in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>The chief policy in this Government, is the keeping the Nobility at odds, which are so unwise as to be so to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy.</NOTE> greatest degree imaginable, not daring any one of them to go 20. miles out of Town, without a Guard of 50. or a hundred Horse, with which they are supply'd for the most part out of the Troops of <HI>Banditi,</HI> that for this reason are by them supported and protected, every great man having his Squadron of Rogues ready at a little summons to attempt any thing upon his Enemy. The Inquisition, they here, would very fain have as severe

<P>The holy Chamber brought by Angels to <HI>Loreto,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Loreto.</NOTE> has now a Church built over it; before which is a Fountain, and the Statue of <HI>Sixtus Quintus;</HI> and for yet better security from eyes and hands, is wall'd about with Marble, beautified with Statues of <HI>Sibills</HI> and <HI>Prophets;</HI> within 'tis little, the materials brick; has but one Window, and at that the Angel entred when he brought news of the Incarnation; the Furniture is much better, for the Cupboard of Plate they had sent with the House, was only some earthen Vessels; but now it has several of Gold, set with Jewels, besides Sil∣ver, Amber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there not being a Prince, nor great Family in <HI>Europe,</HI> that on the score of some danger or deliverance have not made their presents to it, except the <HI>English,</HI> who have either been more fortunate, or wiser than the rest. What is of value above all the Riches, is the Virgin with our Saviour in her Arms, made of Cedar, by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> which came also with the House, and is defended by an Iron-gate: In the Room where they keep their most superfluous Treasure, they show divers rich Gowns, for this Image, which are kept for Holy-days. It has an Apothecaries Shop be∣longing to it, for the use of Pilgrims, in which there are some pots that were painted by <HI>Raphael Urbin.</HI> The next remarkable thing is their Cellar, which is the largest in <HI>Italy,</HI> stor'd with vast Tuns of excellent Wine; another mark of Peoples Charity.</P>

<P>In St. <HI>Salvatore</HI> there is two Pictures by <HI>Titian,</HI> of <NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Salvatore</NOTE> the Transfiguration and Annunciation.</P>
<P>The Church of our Lady is built in an Oval, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Madonna di Salute.</NOTE> not yet finish'd, was a Vow of the Senates in a great Plague.</P>

<P>The <HI>Arsenal</HI> is esteem'd three miles in compass, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arsenal.</NOTE> though not half so much, is vastly great, having Rooms not only for materials, and to make all sorts of Provisions of War, and Magazines for them, when done, but
<PB N="105" REF="54"/> their Docks for Galleys, Ships, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are there also, and every thing that appertains to them, there furnish'd and wrought; all which employs constantly about 1500. Men. In two Chambers above-stairs are Arms for 50000. men, and in two other Rooms the same for 60. Gallies, among which there is the rich <HI>Bucentoro,</HI> gilded and carved all over, on which the <HI>Doge</HI> and <HI>Senators</HI> go to wed the Sea.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Murano</HI> is the place where their Glass∣houses <NOTE PLACE="marg">Murano.</NOTE> stand, whose Trade is infinitely decreas'd, and the Canal by it, the place of <HI>Corso,</HI> where the Summer Evenings the Ladies take the Fresco.</P>
<P>The Diversions there in <HI>Carneval,</HI> are variety of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carnevale.</NOTE> Habits and Humors, 10000. meeting every After-noon in St. <HI>Marks Piazza,</HI> of almost so many different Shapes and Gestures, where there is freedom of saying or do∣ing any thing whilst mask'd: After 'tis dusk, many of the best quality retire to the <HI>Ridotti,</HI> a sort of Gaming houses where they play at Cards, or talk with the La∣dies, a liberty they only have at this Season, and for that reason, the men in general are Cuckolded but once a year, from thence they either go to the Comedies or incomparable Opera's, where the Scenes and Voices so far excel the <HI>French,</HI> that they have scarce resem∣blance. Towards the latter end of <HI>Carneval,</HI> they make sport with Baiting of Bulls, and some of their heads are cut off with Swords at a blow: They have Girls, Boys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that play all the Tricks on the high and low Rope, flye down from St. <HI>Marks</HI> Steeple, with Fire works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the <HI>Cavallerizzo</HI> I saw twelve no∣ble <HI>Venetians</HI> richly arm'd and drest with Point, Fea∣thers, and Habits of different colours (to distinguish them) perform on <HI>Neapolitane</HI> Horses all the exercises of Lance, Sword, and Pistol; at Sea-monsters so plac'd,
<PB N="106" REF="55"/> that they made a pretty Figure in the action; after∣wards the Deities of Earth and Sea in great Machines being present, to the Musick, soft <HI>Tromba,</HI> and incom∣parable Voice of rare <HI>Antonina,</HI> gallop'd and stopt in such excellent time and order, that no Country Dance was ever better perform'd, not the least mistake or error happening all the time.</P>
<P>The Soveraignty is in the Grand Councel, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment.</NOTE> consists of all the other Councels and Magistrates; next in the Senate, or Pregadi, the Colledge, the Councel of <HI>Ten,</HI> the <HI>Quarante Criminale,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Grand Councel having the Supream power, con∣fers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grand Councel.</NOTE> Dignities, makes Laws, Creates Magistrates, and all the other Councels, and into it no Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> can enter, before the Age of 25. years, except by Balloting for it, and then if it be his lot, he may sit at 20.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pregadi</HI> are the body of the Senate, so called <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pregadi.</NOTE> from being pray'd to come to Councel, has now an ad∣dition of 60. more, called the <HI>Giunto,</HI> and admits be∣sides the <HI>Colledge,</HI> the <HI>Concillij Criminali,</HI> the Coun∣cel of <HI>Tenn,</HI> and some other Magistrates, in all to the number of 276. who Vote by little soft Balls like But∣tons, white and yellow put into a Box devided, of the same colours, which takes away all fear of making Ene∣mies, and prevents Cabals and Factions: To these are belonging 24. Secretaries, 12. attending, the others with Embassadors.</P>
<P>The Colledge consists of the <HI>Doge,</HI> and six Coun∣cellors, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colledge.</NOTE> together stiled the <HI>Sig<SUP>ria.</SUP></HI> and the eldest of them, in the <HI>Doges</HI> absence supplies his place, so that busi∣ness has no delay: There sits likewise three <HI>Capi,</HI> of the <HI>Quarante Criminale,</HI> which represent that Coun∣cel; six <HI>Savij Grandi,</HI> five <HI>di Terra Ferma,</HI> and five <HI>Savij alli Ordini;</HI> which last, are young men, plac'd
<PB N="107" REF="55"/> there only to Learn: These receive Petitions, open Let∣ters, give Audience to publick Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but no positive Answers, those depending on the Senate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Embrs. Aud.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the Entrance of Embassadors into this Colledge, they all rise up, and are bare, except the <HI>Doge,</HI> who is so only to Cardinals and Princes, on whose right hand they are afterwards plac'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doge</HI> is chosen by all the Nobility of above <NOTE PLACE="marg">Doge.</NOTE> thirty years old, by Ballotting several ways for Electors, and then they again for others, varying so often to pre∣vent Factions: The Duke, when Elected, has no So∣veraignty but in Name, the honour of a Throne, his Mantle and fantastick Crown; yet to make him some∣thing esteem'd, they allow all Letters to be directed to him, Money Coyn'd, and Dispatches Sign'd by him, but no Guards, least he should make himself more conside∣rable: His constant Revenue but 100. <HI>Zecchins</HI> a week, and his Children and Brothers deprived th'en∣joying any great charge in the State, during his Life, he himself not being permitted to go out of <HI>Venice</HI> without Leave, and is then without any power.</P>
<P>The Councel of <HI>Tenn</HI> now increas'd to the number <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Councel of</HI> Tenn.</NOTE> of Seaventeen, besides the Duke and his six Councellors, Elected of different Families, without the least affinity or Alliance; are Judges of Treasons and all Criminal matters of highest importance, and Instituted for a check upon the Nobilli: These chuse amongst them∣selves <NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquisitors.</NOTE> three Inquisitors of State, who serve by turns, have power to enquire against the <HI>Doge</HI> himself, and every slight suspicion is sufficient to Banish, Imprison, or punish with Death, without mercy, any that reveal their secrets, or Usurp any of the publick Treasure, or Revenue, not regarding the doing an Injustice to par∣ticulars for the publick good.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="56"/>
<P> The 40 <HI>Criminale</HI> is form'd most of the Nobilli too; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quaranta Criminale.</NOTE> of which sort of Council, there are two more, of a second Rank, or Poorer Nobillity; instituted, that none might be discontented, but every one might have his share in the Government: The one is called <HI>Civil Vecchia;</HI> the other, <HI>Civil Nuova:</HI> The first, for Appeals from the City, the latter from the Country; and they sit in Se∣nate by turns, every sixteen Moneths; which Change is practis'd, in the Senate it self, the Councel of Tenn, and in all other Offices, and Magistrates, except the Chancellor: The People by that means, in a little space, being freed from Oppression, and ill Governours, if such should chance to be Elected: Besides, so many Councels prevents the Altering of the Government; which from a few, might easier succeed, and sooner dis∣patch Business.</P>
<P>The Six <HI>Savij Grandi,</HI> are a kind of Ministers of State; who every day after Councel, consult together <NOTE PLACE="marg">Savij Gran∣di.</NOTE> of that Dayes Business; and once a Week, carry what is Ripe to the Senate; and being Men of great Experi∣ence, their Preparation prevents the Confusion that would arise from so many Opinions; the Ignorant be∣ing ever the greatest Number in all Assemblies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Savij di Terra Ferma</HI> are inferior to the For∣mer; <NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Savij di Terra Fer∣ma.</NOTE> can give their Votes in the Colledge, but not in the Senate: And of these are chosen the <HI>Savio Cas∣siere,</HI> and the <HI>Savio alla Scrittura;</HI> the first provides and disburses the Money; the other has the Superinten∣dance of the <HI>Militia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Procuratorij</HI> ought to be but Nine, but are now <NOTE PLACE="marg">Procura∣torij.</NOTE> Thirty six; encreased by their Necessities in the Warr of <HI>Candia,</HI> then selling these Honours, for 20000 Duc∣cats a piece; but as they dye, will come to their first Institution. The Dignity is esteem'd very great; for,
<PB N="109" REF="56"/> having the doors of the Senate always open to them, and freed from being sent Embassadors, except in ex∣traordinary; yet this Office nevertheless is void of all power, not having the liberty to enter either into the Grand Councel, or that of <HI>Tenn,</HI> but is purely Church∣warden, and without any other Authority than what relates to the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> the having a care of Orphans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Citizens are admitted to have several Charges; one <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grand Chancellor.</NOTE> of the Principal is made Grand Chancellor, with the Title of Ex<SUP>c•.</SUP> Ducal habit, and the priviledge to enter into Senate, Councels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where he may give his O∣pinion, but not Vote; his allowance 3000. <HI>Duccats</HI> a year, and worth 10000. more, is the only place that is for term of Life, and esteem'd the best in the Re∣publique.</P>
<P>They have also three <HI>Avogadors,</HI> a sort of Attorney <NOTE PLACE="marg">Avogadors.</NOTE> General, which to make more fierce and keen, are al∣low'd good part of the Estates Confiscated: The seve∣ral Providitori, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because too tedious, I omit; but 'tis to be observ'd that no man is suffer'd to enjoy two places, be they never so inconsiderable, and the Nobi∣lity must run through the most inferior employments, before they can possess those that are desirable, by which means they arrive at the great ones, when they are in riper years, and fitter to manage them, and the small ones are not despised; for if any refuse the charge he is Elected to, he is fined 2000. <HI>Duccats,</HI> and Banish'd the Grand Counsel for two years.</P>
<P>The noble Families, with those added in the War of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Nobility.</NOTE> <HI>Candia,</HI> are about 220. and before that, to conceal their small number, and take away emulation, they gave leave to Secretaries, Lawyers, Physicians and Nota∣ries to wear their habits, which they still continue.</P>
<PB N="110" REF="57"/>
<P> They are so Jealous of one anothers aspiring to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealousie.</NOTE> Soveraignty, that they will not suffer Popularity in a∣ny, and therefore poyson'd <HI>Loredano</HI> for having emi∣nently served his Country in quieting and appeasing a Tumult with his single presence, that none of the Magistrates with Arguments or Force could prevail upon.</P>
<P>To speak with any forreign Minister, or his Ser∣vants, is no less than Treason, and therefore they flye them like the Plague, a Policy in such a Government, absolutely necessary, for in so great an Assembly there will be some, from whom Embassadors by their presents would not want Intelligence of their greatest secrets, and now no Treasure or Reward can prevail to make them hang upon the Gallowes by the foot.</P>
<P>Their own Embassadors, at their return, are oblig'd to give in writing an account of their Negociation, and to lay their presents before the Senate which marks of honor, they are nevertheless not deprived of.</P>
<P>In the Government they leave the Reins loose, in all <NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy.</NOTE> things that are not directly prejudicial to the State; their greatest Vices, Wenching and Gaming, are coun∣tenanc'd, because it renders them too Slothful and Ef∣feminate to think of Rebellion; and in imitation of the Nobility, the Religious also take their liberty, it not being in the power of the <HI>Nuncio</HI> nor Pope him∣self to hinder; for the Secular Magistrate can only im∣prison, who will rather protect than punish; and they would not have the Priests of Exemplar piety, lest they should by the Vulgar be too much lov'd and rever'd, which might at one time or other prove dan∣gerous to the State; besides, by conniving at their De∣bauchery, they can the easier get their Monasteries sup∣press'd by the Pope when they have need of money.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="57"/>
<P> The Spiritual affairs are govern'd by a Patriarch, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Patriarch and Inquisition.</NOTE> which always is a noble Venetian, and chosen by the Senate, who have plac'd three Nobles also in the In∣quisition, as Assistants, without which the Ecclesiasticks can effect nothing; and order'd that the goods of the Condemn'd should not go to the Church, but to the Heirs of the Criminal; so that, that, which in other places is a terrible Tribunal, there frights no body, having power only to act by the Senates will, who suf∣fer Heresie because 'tis a City of Trade, and other Crimes and Sins being inferior to that, are not minded; <HI>Lutherans</HI> too, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are without scruple Bury'd in their Churches.</P>
<P>When any Dispatch arrives from <HI>Rome,</HI> the Senate <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pope ob∣lig'd.</NOTE> make use of two Doctors, one of Divinity, the other of Law; and the latter is to observe there be nothing in it any way to the damage of the State; and then ha∣ving both Sign'd it, 'tis presented to the Senate, with∣out whose assent no Bull has there any force; and if it require any Answer, those two above-nam'd Doctors form it to their mind; and then sending for the <HI>Nun∣cio,</HI> tell him in very good words their Resolution; and if he reply, or desire any further satisfaction in the mat∣ter, they are silent; and any Senator that has Relation to a Cardinal, or Popes Nephew, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cannot be at such debate.</P>
<P>The Devotion of the City in general, is after the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Devotion.</NOTE> Example of the young Nobilli, who use the Churches chiefly for Love appointments: And for the Monaste∣ries of Women, their Exercises are such as would have made even <HI>Aretine</HI> to blush, being accused of Wantonness, Shameful, and Incredible.</P>
<P>They permit abundance of Jews to Live and Trade <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jews.</NOTE> there, who are obliged to keep a small Banck to lend
<PB N="112" REF="58"/> to the Poor on Pawns, without Interest; and wear red Hats for distinction: These for their reputed Secrecy are very much cherish'd by the Nobility, there not being one but has his <HI>Jew</HI> for his Confident, nor <HI>Jew</HI> with∣out his Protector.</P>
<P>Their Territroies on <HI>Terra serma,</HI> are put into these divisions, <HI>La Marca Treviggiana, Il Friuli, Il Padou∣ano,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment of Terra ferma.</NOTE> <HI>Il Vicentino, Il Veronese, Il Bresciano, Il Bergamasco, Il Cremasco;</HI> then part of <HI>Dalmatia, Istria,</HI> the Islands of <HI>Corsu, Zante,</HI> and <HI>Cephalonia, Cerigo, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne,</HI> and three places still remaining to them in the Kingdom of <HI>Candia.</HI> In the Government of these, to make them most secure, they do all they can possible to keep the Nobility at odds, and make them to each other mortal Enemies, a Policy begun by <HI>Erizzo</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Udine,</HI> who observing the great Unity and Friendship of that Gentry, and natural Affection to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> writ to the State that they would provide some remedy for the inconveniences that might grow from it. The advice was grateful, and im∣mediately they sent him Ducal Letters to confer the Dignities of Counts on several of the most ancient Fa∣milies, which he was to do on pretence of rewarding their merits: These Honours were greedily received, and immediately between them and those that wanted, grew a mortal feu'd, not yet extinguish'd, which has not only prevented them from having any Plots or In∣telligence with their Neighbors, but by their frequent quarrels and follies, made them forfeit most of their E∣states, to the great advantage of the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>Their strongest places are <HI>Orsinuovi, Peschiera,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Places of Strength.</NOTE> <HI>Linago, Castel di Brescia, Castel S. Felice di Ve∣rona</HI> and <HI>Palma Nuova</HI> in <HI>Friuli,</HI> which is one of the best, being round, with nine Royal Bulworks, three
<PB N="113" REF="58"/> miles in compass, and requires 8000. Men. It is a Fortification against <HI>Germany,</HI> and secures that Coun∣try from the Ravage of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>As to their Souldiers, the Republique is serv'd by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Souldiers, Galleys,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Strangers, <HI>Germans</HI> and others, their Militia of <HI>Terra Ferma</HI> being of little Value, having no experience; but they think them useful on any suddain Alarm, and might resist till they could provide better; besides, do serve to make a show to their Neighbors of seeming al∣ways Arm'd: Their own people they dare not train, nor of them compose an absolute Army, lest they should turn their Arms upon the Nobility themselves, who they perfectly hate: The State therefore leaves them freely to enjoy all manner of Sloth and Luxury; the Republique by their Mony only, and others Dissenti∣ons, having made themselves thus considerable, not by their own Valour. Of this Militia (such as it is) they have 139. Companies, and the Captains and Serjeants have Pay; they have besides 20. Companies, of 200. each; and 15. Troops of Horse that are all paid; six Gallys always in the Gulf, and 30. more in rea∣diness, which they can double upon occasion.</P>
<P>Their Revenue is about four Millions and a half <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenue.</NOTE> yearly of <HI>Duccats,</HI> but in time of War they encrease their Gabels and Impositions on all things, which is ever paid without Force or Violence. In the last War with <HI>Candia,</HI> they sold all Offices, by which they rais'd 500000. <HI>Duccats,</HI> the Lands that was given to the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> Commons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> besides the great sum by the suppress'd Monasteries, and the advantage they had by leaving the door of Honour open to all that brought 100000. <HI>Duccats</HI> to be made noble; which last has been of ill Consequence, for being most Mer∣chants that were so admitted, that mony, and they, being
<PB N="114" REF="59"/> otherwise employ'd, they have since considerably decay'd in their Trade; the soul of that, and all other States: In the same time they also had a Lottery, with which they got a very great sum of money, and drew most of it out of Strangers pockets, and a long time publickly delay'd the giving the Prizes, alledging they were not all drawn; so had the use of both.</P>
<P>Of greatest advantage is the <HI>Banco di Giro,</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Banco di Giro.</NOTE> the Republick have the Benefit of more than five Millions of <HI>Duccats</HI> without a farthing Interest; every Merchant putting in part of his Estate there, which upon any bargain is pass'd to another without other de∣lay or circumstance, then altering the name; and if any man would have ready money for his Intrest in it, there are always those ready to give it him; and who have not moneys in this manner, have not any Credit; for there they go to see the worth first of him they intend to trust, and accordingly confide.</P>

<P>There was anciently great Enmity between the State <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genoua.</NOTE> of <HI>Genoua</HI> and this Republick; but since they appear'd for the Intrest of <HI>France,</HI> as well as <HI>Spain,</HI> it is much lessen'd.</P>

<P>To the Emperors damage they are always forward to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Emperor.</NOTE> contribute where it is not prejudicial to themselves, and the rather, because conscious how much they Usurp of his, They conclude he can never be their Friend; and are so strickt in their Dominion over the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> that they make him pay an acknowledgment for all Vessels that come into any of his own Ports in that Sea.</P>

<P>There is no Nation they hate so much as the <HI>French,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">France.</NOTE> for they look upon them as Authors of the War in <HI>Can∣dia,</HI> and the loss of it too, giving them seeming suc∣cours only, and behaved themselves there, as they did in their Fleet, assisting of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
