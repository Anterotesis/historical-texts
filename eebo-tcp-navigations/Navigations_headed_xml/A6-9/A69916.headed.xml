<HEAD>TO THE WORTHY
Samuel Sheppard, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
SHERIFF Elect for the
CITY of LONDON
And COUNTY of
MIDDLESEX.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, when I saw so considerable
a part of the Nation join'd in
the design of settling the <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade upon a new Foundation, I
thought I could scarce pitch upon a
more seasonable juncture, than this,
to make my Authors appear in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to give us an account of their
<PB REF="3"/>
ten Years Transactions, among the
same Nations, where in all probabi∣lity
our <HI>Indian</HI> Trade is to be carri∣ed
on to the Honour and Advantage
of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. I will not
pretend to enlarge my self here up∣on
the usefulness of Commerce in
General, or of that of the <HI>Indies</HI> in
Particular; if the station I am in did
not excuse me from undertaking
that task, the universal consent of all
civilized Nations, who look upon
traffick as one of the main Pillars of
the prosperity of the Common-Wealth,
is a demonstration suffici∣ent
to over-balance any thing that
can be said upon so ample a subject
by a private hand. And as to
what relates to the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade in
particular, our Neighbours the
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>Dutch,</HI> who have made it the foun∣dation
stone of the present flourish∣ing
State of their Common-wealth,
are living instances, to convince us
what improvements may be made in
this kind, if managed by a dextrous
hand. I might in this place have
made some Reflections, perhaps not
altogether useless, upon the present
condition of some of the <HI>Indian</HI>
Countries, especially upon those on
the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> who being
divided into so many petty Princi∣palities,
and for the most part Situ∣ated
very convenient for Traffick,
seem to invite us to be sharers with
them in the vast advantages the <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade affords: But when I
considered with my self the extra∣ordinary
ability of the Person, un∣to
<PB REF="4"/>
whom I was making my addres∣ses,
and on the other hand what
slender share of experience I had
in these affairs, I was not without
reason afraid I should run my self
into the same Error a certain an∣cient
<HI>Grecian</HI> Philosopher did, who
being Honoured with a Visit by that
renown'd <HI>African</HI> Warriour <HI>Han∣nibal,</HI>
entertain'd him with a very
long and tedious lesson concerning
the duty of a General. I will inge∣nuously
confess, it was chiefly upon
the score of your Merits, and the
reputation you have so deservedly
acquired in the management of an
affair of the utmost consequence to
the Glory and Advantage of the
<HI>English</HI> Nation, that when these
<HI>Indian</HI> Travellers after their return
<PB REF="4"/>
home from a long and most dange∣rous
Voyage, were to make their
appearance among us; I judg'd I
could not recommend them to the
protection of any other person, than
your self, who both for your Abi∣lity
and Zeal, have given such am∣ple
demonstrations to the World in
what relates to the affairs of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI>
that, as your Judgment, by
the consent of all sides, is unquesti∣onable,
so these Travellers have all
the reason imaginable to promise
themselves due Encouragement from
your generous inclinations. Before I
conclude; I cannot pass by in silence,
and apply with some small alterations
here, the words Mr. <HI>Rennefort</HI> makes
use of in respect of the <HI>French East-India</HI>
Company; that since our pre∣sent
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>East-India</HI> Company is establish∣ed
by the consent of the representa∣tives
of the whole Nation, under the
protection of his present Majesty,
who by his most Glorious Actions,
has made himself both Admired and
Redoubted in far distant Countries,
we have all the reason to hope, that
under the Direction of such Persons,
who have an equal share of Experi∣ence,
Conduct and Honour, they
may in time, at least equalize, if not
out-vie the rest of the <HI>European</HI> Na∣tions
that have established themselves
in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> Which is the
hearty wish of him, who subscribes
himself,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Humble Servant,
<HI>J. C. Med. D.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE
PREEACE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE ensuing Treatise, falling by
chance into my hands; after a
full perusal of it, I thought it highly
worth my care of making it appear in
the World under an <HI>English</HI> Garb, at
a time, when our Nation has a very
near concern in Foreign Affairs, and
its Genius seems more than ever bent
upon the improvement of its Knowledge,
<PB REF="6"/>
in relation to Foreign Countries. I lay
this down as a general meaning, which
I suppose few will contradict, that as
those who want the conveniency of sa∣tisfying
their curiosity by travelling a∣broad
themselves, (especially in far di∣stant
Countries) cannot in any way bet∣ter
supply this defect, than by applying
themselves to such Authors, as by a long
experience having had the opportunity of
informing themselves concerning the true
constitution of these-Countries, are in all
probability, the most proper Persons to an∣swer
their end, as having at their own
expence, endeavoured to improve the ge∣neral
knowledge of Mankind. It cannot
be denied, but that in our time, there
have appeared more Books of this kind
abroad, than perhaps all the Ages before
us can produce; and that the <HI>French</HI>
in particular have been more liberal
in furnishing us with the Relations of
their Travels, than any other Nation:
But not to deviate from the truth, it
<PB REF="6"/>
must be also confess'd, That as to what
relates to their Voyages to the <HI>Indies,</HI>
they are for the most part confin'd to the
Description of some particular Country or
other, whereas the ensuing Treatise gives
a view of a great part of that vast
Country, comprehended under the Name
of the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> It may also be ob∣served,
that many of our Modern Au∣thors,
in their Descriptions of these far
distant Countries, have affected a way
of surprising rather than instructing their
Readers; they represent both the Climate
of the <HI>Indies</HI> and its products, as the
effects of a quite different, if not contra∣ry
principle of Nature, from what we
find in our parts, whereas it may be suf∣ficiently
evident, to all such as will con∣sider
the whole without prejudice, that
Nature performs its operations in all
parts of the World, according to its pri∣mitive
Fundamental Laws, that the
Heats and Colds of these several Cli∣mates
differ only in degrees, and that
<PB REF="7"/>
the Monsters of <HI>Africa</HI> or the <HI>Indies,</HI>
are no more surprising to the Inhabitants
of these parts, than the Beasts that
are commonly seen and bred among us
are to the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Most of these
Authors seem to have been seized with
an itch of pleasing their Readers, and
of creating in them an Opinion of their
own more than ordinary Ability, and
insight into the Manners and Customs of
those Nations they have treated of, which
has made them dispose their Treatises
into large Volumes by many Digressions,
artificial Reflections, and sometimes in∣ventions
of their own, such as they
thought most suitable to the genious of
such as they intended to please. I don't
in the least question, but that those who
will peruse the ensuing Account, will
soon be convinced, that Monsieur <HI>Dil∣lon</HI>
its Author, (though a Man of a
more than ordinary Capacity and Learning)
has throughout the whole Treatise acted
with more Sincerity than Artifice, and
<PB REF="7"/>
to make use of his own Words in his Pre∣face.
That, <HI>tho' after a stay of Ten
Years in the</HI> Indies, <HI>he was by an un∣foreseen
Accident obliged to return
to</HI> France <HI>much sooner than he ex∣pected,
whereby he was prevented
of making some particular Observa∣tions,
which might have been suffi∣ciently
diverting to the Reader; and
that therefore, if this Relation might
not be equally pleasing to all who
affect Novelties beyond Truths, and
are taken with Voluminous pieces;
nevertheless, he could assure them,
that as his intention had been to re∣duce
the whole into as small a com∣pass
as the nature of the thing would
admit of, without entangling him∣self
in the Relation of many strange
Adventures, which he could not but
Judge to be nauseous to persons of
a solid Judgment, so he had taken
all the imaginable care not to insert
any thing but what was in all re∣spects
<PB REF="8"/>
consonant to Truth, and
what he had not by hearsay and up∣on
the Credit of others, but by his
own Experience, during his stay in
the</HI> Indies. I cannot pass by in silence,
that the Appendix concerning the Distem∣pers
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> ought to be look'd up∣on
as a singular piece, if it be considered
how little that is Authentick there is ex∣tant
upon that Subject, and that Monsieur
<HI>Dellon,</HI> being a Doctor of Physick, his
profession entitles him to have had a better
insight into it, than most other Travellers
could pretend to. That nothing might be
wanting, which in all probability could
give the better satisfaction to the publick,
I judged it not unadvisable, to add by
way of Supplement, some matters relating
to the <HI>Indies,</HI> taken out of Monsieur <HI>de
Rennefort</HI>'s History of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
which having a near affinity to many things
related by Monsieur <HI>Dellon,</HI> I thought
might much illustrate some matters, which
questionless for brevity's sake he thought
<PB REF="8"/>
fit to pass by in silence; some others there
are, which not being come to Monsieur
<HI>Dellon</HI>'s knowledge, (as about Mon∣sieur
<HI>de la Hay</HI>'s expedition against the
Isle of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and his Transacti∣ons
in the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI>) I be∣lieved
would be no ungrateful Addition to
render the whole the more compleat; e∣specially
when I made due reflection upon
the Character of Monsieur <HI>de Rennefort,</HI>
who having been intrusted for a conside∣rable
time with the management of Affairs
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the <HI>French East-In∣dia</HI>
Company, might claim the same Au∣thority
with Monsieur <HI>Dellon;</HI> but I will
not enlarge my self any further upon the
merits of my Author, being sufficiently
convinced that as his last Chapter, which
contains a project for the improvement of
the <HI>French East-India</HI> Company, shews
him to be a person of a more than ordinary
Capacity and Experience in the <HI>Indian</HI>
Affairs, so the whole Book will be in all
probability accepted of by the unbiass'd
<PB REF="9"/>
and judicious Reader, if not, as the most
ample and perfect in all its parts, at least
as the most Sincere and extensive for its
bulk, as representing in a small compass
a short view of many of the most considera∣ble
parts of those vast Countries, compre∣hended
under the Name of the <HI>East-In∣dies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure out of France.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Mankind have a certain Natural pro∣pensity
to Curiosity, but Young people
have commonly a greater Inclination to
satisfie their own Fancies, taken up for the most
part with Novelties, than those who are arrived
to a ripe Age. For my part having always been
<PB N="2" REF="17"/>
inflamed with a most ardent desire of Travelling,
after I had finished the course of my Studies, I
left <HI>Paris</HI> with no other resolution than to leave
<HI>France,</HI> and by the Conversation with Foreigners
to make my self acquainted with their Genius
and Manners.</P>
<P>Being informed that the Royal <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany
was Equipping some Ships at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> I
directed my course thither, and entred my self in∣to
their Service; in a Ship of 400 Tuns, cal∣led
the <HI>Strong,</HI> Commanded by Captain <HI>Merchand,</HI>
and left that Harbour within 14 days after, in the
Company of the <HI>Golden-Eagle.</HI> But we had scarce
been a few Hours under Sail, when a Calm ob∣liged
us to come to an Anchor, near the Isle of
<HI>Groy,</HI> about 2 Leagues from the <HI>French</HI> Shoar,
where we remain'd till the next Morning, when
with a fresh Gale of North-East Wind, we soon
lost sight of our Native Shoar.</P>
<P>The first inconveniency I was sensible of in this
Voyage, was, my being Sea-Sick, as well as all
the rest, who were most acquainted before with
the Watery Element, but a little time cured us of
that Distemper. For 8 days together we saw no∣thing
but the Sea and the Skies, when at last our
Sentries discovered 4 Sails to the Windward of
us, and we being at that time engaged in a War
with <HI>Spain,</HI> our Captain was getting every thing
ready, in case there should be any occasion of en∣gaging
the Enemy; ordering the <HI>Golden-Eagle,</HI>
who was a nimbler Sailer than we, to endeavour
to come up with them first: But having soon
discovered them to be <HI>French</HI> Ships, bound for
<HI>Newfoundland,</HI> we continu'd our Voyage without
any further hinderance; till some days after, when
a most furious Tempest arose, which lasted near
18 Hours, put us into no small distress; scarce
had we escaped that danger, but we were thrown in∣to
another, no less dangerous than the former▪
For our Ship Sprung a Leak, and then fell in such
a vast quantity of Water, that both our Pumps
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
not being sufficient to exhaust it, it was thought
most advisable, to make, together with the <HI>Golden-Eagle,</HI>
the best of our way to the <HI>French</HI> Coast.
Whilst we were just upon the point of putting it
in execution, the Leak was by good Fortune dis∣covered,
and soon stopped, so that we spent the
remainder of the day in making good Cheer for
Joy of having escaped so imminent a danger. The
next Morning by break of day, we came in sight
of a very large Ship, and the <HI>Golden-Eagle</HI> being
advanced within Canon-Shot, gave her the Signal
of Striking; but finding her not to comply imme∣diately
with our desire, we put out the White Flag,
when she instantly lower'd her Top Sail. This
was a Ship belonging to <HI>Diep,</HI> which was bound
to <HI>Senegal,</HI> where they Trade in Ivory, Feathers
and Gold-Dust; the Captain's Name was <HI>Le Moyne,</HI>
and having thus continued our Voyage together,
we left him near the Mouth of the River <HI>Niger,</HI>
directing our Course to <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> where we Ar∣rived
in 6 Weeks, after our first departure out of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Cape Verd.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a part of <HI>Africa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Verd.</NOTE> Situate at about 14
Degrees North Latitude; it has a pretty
large Bay, but no safe Riding for Ships, as ha∣ving
no shelter against the violence of the Winds,
and it is so dangerous Landing, all round the Bay,
that many <HI>Chaloups</HI> have been lost at their ap∣proach
near the Shoar. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inhabited
at that time a small Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea▪</HI></NOTE> at a little distance
from it, which has had almost as many Masters
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
as have thought it worth their while to take Pos∣session
of it; it being of so little Defence, that
the <HI>Dutch</HI> seem only to keep it, because no body
Disputes with them about the Propriety of a
place, which being very Barren, is destitute of eve∣ry
thing requisite for the necessity and conveni∣ency
of human Life, except what they are sup∣ply'd
with from <HI>Cape Verd.</HI></P>
<P>The people Inhabiting <HI>Cape Verd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inhabi∣tants of</HI> Cape Verd.</NOTE> are of a most
dreadful Aspect, much beyond what the rest of
the <HI>Africans</HI> are; the Women are as ugly as the
Men; the first carry their Children upon their
Backs, and suckle them over their Shoulders. They
are much addicted to hunting, and as lascivious as
they are ugly, prostituting themselves in publick
to Strangers. The <HI>Africans</HI> are for the most part
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> but besides this, they use many super∣stitious
Ceremonies, which have not the least Af∣finity
with those prescrib'd in the Alcoran. They
are generally very obliging to such Strangers as
chance to Land on their Coast; but Stealing is
so common a practice with them, that one is ob∣liged
to be constantly upon one's guard. They
Live for the most part upon what they catch when
they go a Hunting, and their Bread is made of
Millet, they having no great store of Rice or
Wheat.</P>
<P>But I will not pretend to enlarge my self here
upon their manner of living, others having suffi∣ciently
acquitted themselves as to this part before
me; and, as I have taken a resolution to deal
with the utmost sincerity in all respects, so I
will confess ingeniously, that I had not sufficient
opportunity to inform my self fully concerning all
matters relating to this people, we not staying here
any longer than was absolutely requisite, for the
providing us with necessary refreshments.</P>
<P>For after a stay of 12 days, the Wind being fa∣vourable,
we weighed Anchor, and put again to
Sea, but before we lost sight of the Shoar, we
were becalmed for some days, during which time,
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
we diverted our selves with Fishing, but especi∣ally
with catching of <HI>Requins,</HI> (which the <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
call <HI>Tuberos</HI>) of whom we took a consi∣derable
number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fish called <HI>Re∣quin.</HI></NOTE> only to have the satisfaction of
selling them; they being seldom made use of, but
in case of the greatest extremity, because their
Flesh is extreamly hard and scarce digestible.
There are some of them of that bigness as to be
able to swallow a Man; the Females bear their
Young ones in their Bellies, without the least ap∣pearance
of any Spawn; I have found a dozen
Young ones at a time, which being cut out of
the Bellies of the Old ones, were a Foot and half
long, and much better to Eat than the great
ones.</P>
<P>There are also several other sorts of Fish catch'd
betwixt the two Tropicks, and among others
those call'd by the <HI>Portugueses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonites.</NOTE> <HI>Bonites,</HI> a very de∣licious
Fish, and one of the best in those Seas.
The flying Fish are to be met with here in great
numbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flying-Fish.</NOTE> resembling both in shape and bigness
our Herrings, their Wings being not unlike to
those of a Flittermouse. They cannot make use
of them unless they be wet, which makes them
continually plunge themselves in the Water. It
is the most surprizing thing in the World to see
them in so prodigious numbers, if it be consi∣der'd
that they are surrounded in both the Ele∣ments
by their Enemies, who gives them but lit∣tle
rest, whereever they meet with them; for the
Birds continually persecute them in the Air, and
when they seek for refuge in the Water, the
<HI>Bonites,</HI> who have a great antipathy against them,
devour them; so that whereever they are, they are
never secure against their Enemies.</P>
<P>We pass'd the Equinoctial Line about 3 Weeks
after our departure from <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> and about a
Month after the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto we had met with no considerable dis∣aster,
during our whole Voyage; but now the
<HI>Golden-Eagle</HI> being destitute of fresh Water, we
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
were fain to share ours with her, and the next
following Night were separated from one another
by stress of Weather. But the worst of all was,
that our Ship sprung 3 days after another Leak,
which let in the Water in such a quantity, as to
make us sufficiently sensible of our imminent dan∣ger,
of being inevitably lost, we being at too great
a distance from any Shoar, to entertain the least
hopes of escaping the danger; but we had once
more the good Fortune to find out the Leak,
and by applying speedy and effectual Remedies
against the evil, that a few Hours before threat∣ned
our destruction, the hopes of Life began to
resettle our disturbed Spirits, which the fear of
our approaching cruel Fate and the constant fa∣tigues
had almost robb'd us of before. But we
were for a considerable time afterwards pestered
by contrary Winds, so that we did not come
within sight of the Isle <HI>Dauphin,</HI> (called by the
<HI>Portugueses,</HI> St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and by the Natives, <HI>Ma∣dagascar,</HI>)
under the 26th Degree of the Southern
Latitude, till 7 Weeks after we had pass'd the
Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> on the West-side, which did
not a little surprize our Pilates, who believed to
have been on the East side of it. We were put
to no small trouble, and endur'd great fatigues,
before we could double the Southern Cape of this
Island, by reason of the contrary Winds. It was
then that Distempers began to reign among our
Ships Crew, two thirds of them being disabled
by the Scurvy; this is that so much dreaded Sea-plague,
which the <HI>French</HI> Sea-Men call the Evil
of the Land, because it is from thence alone they
expect the cure of this dreadful Distemper. There
were very few of the whole Ships Crew, who
had not their share of it, and this joyned with
the continual fatigues, occasioned by the fury of
contrary Winds, put us almost in despair, as be∣ing
bereaved of all hopes of reaching the Shoar,
if Providence had not delivered us again by Mi∣racle.
For the Wind wheeling about, all upon a
<PB N="7" REF="19"/>
sudden, we came 3 Weeks after we had first dis∣covered
the Shoar of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> in sight of the
Isle of <HI>Burbon,</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Mascareigne,</HI>) ha∣ving
not lost above 3 of our whole Crew, yet
we were 4 days longer before we could reach the
Shoar, where we cast our Anchors, directly op∣posite
to one of the <HI>French</HI> Plantations, called St.
<HI>Paul,</HI> Situate on the West-side of the Island; the
first thing we had to do was to take care of our
Sick Men, who were brought on Shoar, where
we lost 2 more of our Men, one being Drowned,
and the other expiring so soon as he was set on
Shoar.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Isle of Burbon, otherwise called
Mascareigne.</HEAD>
<P>THO' I am sufficiently sensible that several o∣thers
before have given a particular Descrip∣tion
of this Island; I will nevertheless relate here,
what I have been an eye witness of, pursuant to my
intention.</P>
<P>This Island is Situate under the 21st Degree of
Southern Latitude;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Burbon</HI> described.</NOTE> 150 Leagues distant from the
Isle <HI>Dauphine.</HI> Its Circuit is of about 22 <HI>French</HI>
Leagues, and its figure almost circular. The
<HI>French</HI> have settled themselves there for above
these 40 Years, and there are not the least Foot∣steps
to be found of any people having Inhabited
this Island before that time. What the Ancients
have been perswaded about the Torrid Zone to
be Uninhabitable, is sufficiently contradicted by the
experience of our Modern Travellers; the Air
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
being not so excessive hot, as has been imagined,
in those parts, because the heats occasion'd by the
near approach of the Sun, are allayed by the
cool Rains that fall in the Night-time. It never
Rains here but towards the end of <HI>April,</HI> or the be∣ginning
of <HI>March;</HI> about which time, the Hurri∣canes
being so frequent on this Coast, Ships can∣not
approach, much less ride at Anchor, with∣out
great danger; the Island being destitute of
safe Harbours. From the time of the first Estab∣lishment
of the <HI>French</HI> in this Island, 'till our Ar∣rival,
there has not been one instance, that Tra∣vellers
who came to this Island were ever troubled
with any Distempers; on the contrary, 'tis very
rare but such as are afflicted with different Diseases,
are restored to their Health in a little time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Health∣ful.</NOTE> four∣score
of our Ships Crew can verifie this by their
own Experience, they having all been recovered
in 10 or 12 days. This Island is watered by a
great many small Rivers, abounding in Fish to
that degree, that if you intend to wade through
them, (which you may do for the most part with
ease,) you must provide your self with a good
Stick to lean upon, for fear of being carried a∣way
by the vast number and swiftness of the Fish,
which you may catch at pleasure with your Hands,
without any Lines or Hooks.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> call the Northern Coast of this Island,
the <HI>Burnt Country,</HI> because that in the Night-time
there constantly issues Fire out of the Ground,
which tho' it vanishes in the Day-time, yet ren∣ders
these Plains quite Barren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Fertili∣ty and Fruits.</NOTE> and unfit for use.
But on the opposite side, there is a great Tract
of Ground, which the <HI>French</HI> call the Beautiful
Country; this having been Cultivated with great
Industry, produces several sorts of Fruits, Grain,
and Herbs in abundance.</P>
<P>Here you have most excellent <HI>Water-Melons,</HI>
which the <HI>Indians</HI> call <HI>Patequas,</HI> and the <HI>Portugueses
Balancias;</HI> they exceed our <HI>European</HI> Melons in
bigness, their peel is greener, they're much tenderer,
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
nothing in the World is more proper to quench
ones Thirst, they being of a most agreeable re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh,
and you may eat as much of them as
you please, without the least danger to your
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ealth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bananas</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Figs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bananas <HI>or</HI> Indian <HI>Figs.</HI></NOTE> are no less plenti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l
here, and of a most delicious Taste. The Tree
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stalk on which they grow is different from ours;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seldom grows above 8 or 10 Foot high, with∣out
any Branches; quite on the Top of the Trunk,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere sprouts out a single bunch or cluster, of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ickness of a Man's Arm, and about 3 Foot long,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und which the <HI>Bananas</HI> hang like Grapes. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruit differs as well in Colour, as in Taste and

<P>The Sea <HI>Tortoises</HI> are somewhat rarer than the

Those that go out to catch them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How catch'd▪</NOTE> watch their op∣portunity,

But the Land <HI>Tortoises</HI> being not altogether

There are some of both kinds, of a pro∣digious
bigness, but they are of a different Taste;
The Flesh of the Sea <HI>Tortoises</HI> is look'd upon as a
sovereign Remedy against the Scurvy. There
have been 800 Eggs found at a time in a <HI>Tortoise,</HI>
every one as big as a Goose Egg▪ some ready to be

when the <HI>French</HI> soon extirpated the whole race of
these Tyrannical Leaders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are extir∣pated.</NOTE> there being nothing left
of them now, but the slender Remnants of a few
Women who were saved out of compassion to
their Sex.</P>
<P>The Isle <HI>Dauphine</HI> is near as populous as <HI>France;</HI>
they have no Cities, but a vast number of Villages
at a small distance from one another; their Houses
are all of Wood, the Doors so low, that a Child of
twelve years can scarce enter without bending
his Body; they make use neither of Windows nor
Chimneys, and their Houses are covered with leaves
or a certain kind of Straw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of li∣ving.</NOTE> which will keep out the
Rain for ten or twelve years, without being mend∣ed;
but if a Fire happens to light among these
Houses, it makes great havock. Their Houshold
Stuff consists in no more than a few Baskets, where∣in
they put their cloaths; if they don't like their
dwelling places, they remove their Houses without
much difficulty, some of them frequently changing
their Habitations.</P>
<P>Both Men and Women go bare-headed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ap∣parel.</NOTE> and let
their Hair grow to a great length. The men sel∣dom
wear any thing else but a piece of Cotton or
Silk, of the breadth of half an Ell, and an Ell and
a half long; this they wind round their Waste, one
end of it coming betwixt their Legs. The Women
wear a kind of narrow Wast-coasts, scarce covering
their Breasts, but the Sleeves reach down to their
Wrists; for the rest, they have a piece of stuff
which they wind round their middle, and from
thence reaches down to their Heels.</P>
<P>The poorer sort cloath themselves with a stuff
made out of the Bark of Trees, which reaches no
further than the Knees; because it should be no
impediment to them in their daily Employment.
Both Men and Women take equal Pride in Brace∣lets
and Necklaces; they walk all Bare-footed; they
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
Anoint their Bodies with a certain stinking Grease,
which together with their Natural Ugliness, ren∣ders
them the nastiest People in the Universe. They
make use of no other Beds than Mats spread upon

<P>The <HI>Rohundrians</HI> (their chief Governours or pet∣ty

of Quality are carried in the same manner, as
are also the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> here of any Fashion, espe∣cially
when they Travel.</P>
<P>They are much addicted to War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are War∣like.</NOTE> and very faith∣ful
to their <HI>Rohundrians.</HI> All the riches of these pet∣ty
Kings consist in the great number of their Oxen
and Slaves; they are embroil'd in continual Quar∣rels
with their Neighbours, which commonly end
in bloody Wars among themselves; the vanquish'd
are most cruelly treated by the Conquerors, who
spare neither Sex nor Age, but sacrifice all to their
Vengeance; if you ask them the reason of their
Cruelties, why they should carry their Vengeance
so far, as not to spare the innocent Babes, whom
they tear from their Mothers Breasts, to dash out
their Brains against the Rocks, they give you for
answer, That to spare them, would be to preserve
in them their most irreconcilable Enemies, who
one day, might be in a Capacity, to revenge upon
their heads, the Cruelties exercised against their Pa∣rents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenge∣ful.</NOTE>
which sufficiently Testifies, that they are ve∣ry

During our stay at▪ Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> we were enga∣ged
in a War with one of the most Potent Lords
of the whole Island, whose Name was <HI>Rasaf:</HI> He
brought about Fourteen Thousand Men into the
Field, whereas the whole strength of the <HI>French</HI> con∣sisted
only in an Hundred and Forty <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and
Three Hundred <HI>Negroes,</HI> who had espoused the
<HI>French</HI> Interest. They were Commanded by Mon∣sieur
<HI>de Charmagouz,</HI> who carrying along with him a
Led-horse, the poor <HI>Negroes</HI> were so surprized at
the sight of this Creature, that they paid it the same
respect as to its Master.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> met the <HI>Madagascarians,</HI> Command∣ded
by <HI>Rasaf</HI> in Person, in a great Plain, which by
reason of the inequality of their Number, being
very advantageous for <HI>Rasaf,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> rout the Islanders.</NOTE> he marched upon the
<HI>French,</HI> with a great deal of Bravery, but being
warmly received by the <HI>French</HI> Fire-locks, they were
soon repulsed and put to Flight; their Prince used
all possible means to Rally his Subjects, but these be∣ing
terrified by the surprize of the <HI>French</HI> Fire-Arms,
would not return to the charge, except some
few who were near his Person; with these he re∣newed
the Combat, endeavouring to dispute the
Victory with the <HI>French,</HI> till he lost both the Battle
and his Life, leaving a Booty of Thirty Thousand
Oxen, and a vast number of Slaves to the Conque∣rors,
who sent them to Fort <HI>Dauphine;</HI> some of them
died by the way, tired with the Fatigues of there
Engagement, and the tediousness of the Journey;
the rest were shared among the Victors.</P>
<P>This prosperous Success put all the petty Kings
of the whole Island into such a Consternation, that
dreading the Fate of <HI>Rasaf,</HI> and being become wiser
by his Misfortune, endeavoured by all means pos∣sible,
to purchase the Friendship of the <HI>French</HI> Na∣tion;
some of them came in Person to do Homage
to Monsieur <HI>de Mondevergue,</HI> and such as lived at a
greater distance, sent their Ambassadors to perform
the same in their Master's Name. But very few
performed their promise, some among them being
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
so perfidious as to make use of the same Arms which
they had received as presents at the time of their
being with Monsieur <HI>de Mondevergue,</HI> against the
<HI>French</HI> themselves; but they were soon Chastised for
their Insolence, and the misfortunes attending their
Rebellions, fell at last upon their own heads.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THere are so few foot-steps of Religion to be
seen among the Inhabitants of the Isle of <HI>Ma∣dagascar,</HI>
that it might admit of a Question; Whe∣ther
they have any or not?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sa∣crifices.</NOTE> They have neither
Churches nor Priests, the <HI>Rohundrians</HI> are the only
Persons, who observe some religious Ceremonies,
and that but very seldom, and upon extraordinary
occasions: At certain times they Sacrifice an Ox,
but as all the Subjects are Slaves, so no body but
the Prince is to perform the Sacrifice.</P>
<P>It is a General received Custom among them, to
Carbonade their Faces and Arms; but as they are
altogether stupid and ignorant, acting without any
rational motive, I have never been able to discover
the real intention of this Custom, whether it pro∣ceeded
out of a motion of Piety, or that they look'd
upon it as conducing to their Health, or whether
they thus Martyrized their Bodies for Ornaments sake.
The most intelligible among them, confess that
there is an infinite Sovereign Being, which Being all
Goodness has the direction of all Human Affairs;
nevertheless being perverted by an incorrigible ob∣stinacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adore the Devil.</NOTE>
they say, That they see no reason why we
should direct our Prayers to him, who cannot do
Evil, but that we ought to reserve all our Venerati∣on
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
and Vows for the Daemon, who has power to
Torment us. They don't believe the immortality
of the Soul, and consequently making no account of
a future State, they improve this to their best ad∣vantage,
giving themselves over to all manner of
Debaucheries; from whence it comes, that such a∣mong
them as have been by the Missionaries con∣verted
to the Christian Faith, finding the Rules of
Christianity too strict, and not suitable to their
former course of life, commonly return also to their
former Libertinism, as it has been sufficiently con∣firmed
by experience; for of three Thousand that
had been Baptized before our arrival, there were
scarce twenty that used to frequent our Church.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that some of the <HI>French,</HI>
by their manner of living, shew'd but a very ill ex∣ample
to these new Converts; for some of them
live so scandalous a life, that they were forbid the
use of the Sacrament, and to stand only in the
Church porch, during Divine Service. But this
Penance which was intended as a proper remedy to
correct their Libertinism, had almost proved the oc∣casion
of a Schism; for these Libertines having met
with a Priest of their own Kidney, they set up a
Chapel for their own use, where they exercised
Divine Worship in spite of the Commands of their
Superiours to the Contrary, till at last the said Cha∣pel
was ordered to be burnt.</P>
<P>Among some of the <HI>Madagascarians</HI> they observe
not any Rules in their Marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mar∣riages.</NOTE> they copulate to∣gether
without the least Engagement or promise on
either side, and leave one another as freely again as
they met at first. The quite contrary is practised
in the Countries of <HI>Galamboule</HI> and <HI>Antongil,</HI> where
they are so far from being common, that they keep
the Women very close, and if they are convicted of
Adultery, they are punish'd with Death. In other
places where they are more Barbarous, they with∣out
the least regard to the nearness of Blood, com∣mit
the most abominable incests at pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="27"/>
I will not determine here, whether the Women
of <HI>Madagascar</HI> are subject to the same pains as our
<HI>European</HI> Women in Child-bed; but thus much is
certain, that no sooner are they delivered, but lea∣ving
the Child upon a Mat, they go straight-ways
to the next River to Wash themselves, neither take
they any further care of the Child, but only to give
it now and then the Teat.</P>
<P>They have certain days which they solemnize
with Dancing to certain Instruments, made after
their way, besides which they eat at an excessive
rate. Their Songs are not composed to any certain
Tune, as it is Customary among other Nations,
but every one Sings as he pleases; one Voice begins,
the rest follow and make up a Chorus as well as they
can, endeavouring to make their Gesticulations
bear some proportion to their Song and small Tim∣brels;
all which together, makes a confused, but
sometimes not so very disagreeable a Noise.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Feasts,</HEAD>
<P>THe common Food of the Inhabitants of this
Island <HI>Dauphine</HI> or <HI>Madagascar,</HI> is Rice boil'd
with Salt and Water, which serves them instead of
Bread; not but that the Ground will bring forth
good Wheat, but the laziness of those, who should
cultivate it, deprives them of the advantage of this
so useful Commodity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are great Ea∣ters.</NOTE> They are all in general vast
Eaters; nevertheless if a Famine happens, they are
able to endure it with a prodigious Constancy, as
when on the other hand they are at liberty to eat
their fill, six of them will eat a good Ox at a
Meal.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28"/>
In their Feasts they observe the following method;
in the middle of the Assembly, which lie all
round about upon the Ground, they set a good
quantity of boiled Rice; then they lay a whole Ox,
(or sometimes two or three, according to the num∣ber
of the Guests) extended upon his Hide, which
serves instead of a Dish; every one cuts a good
piece for himself where he pleases, which having
put upon a Wooden Stick, he holds it a little to the
Fire, and so devours it before it be half roasted.</P>
<P>There is good store of Grapes in this Island, but
they make seldom any Wine of them; nay, the <HI>Ne∣groes</HI>
will scarce touch them to eat; for before the
<HI>French</HI> came into the Isle, they look'd upon them as
Poison. They make their Drink out of Honey,
which they call <HI>Tenteb,</HI> and their Wine <HI>Chictenteb,</HI>
which signifies as much as Honey Wine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hydro∣mel.</NOTE> or as we
call it, <HI>Hydromel:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> rarely use any other,
and prefer it before Wine.</P>
<P>In each Village there is a large publick Hall, o∣pen
on all sides, covered only on the Roof, where
they put upon any Solemn occasion, a great Vessel
with this <HI>Hydromel,</HI> containing three or four Hogs-heads,
according to the Number of People inhabi∣ting
the Village, and the <HI>Rohundrian</HI> having order∣ed
a proportionable quantity of Beef and Rice to
be brought thither, he himself follows in Person,
and thus entertains his Subjects from Morning till
Night.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Voyage to Galamboule.</HEAD>
<P>DUring our stay at Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> there Arrive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
several Ships from the <HI>Indies,</HI> laden with Pro∣visions,
which came very opportunely to supply
our present Necessities, occasion'd by the last Inu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dations
of the Locusts.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Mondevergue,</HI> being at that time pre∣paring
to return into <HI>France,</HI> he order'd a Ship
lately come from <HI>Suratte,</HI> to be got ready, in or∣der
to send it to <HI>Galamboule,</HI> and some Islands in
those parts, to fetch him what Necessaries he had
occasion for, and to bring away such <HI>French</HI> as
were in Garrison in several little Forts in those
parts, which were very chargeable to the <HI>East-In∣dia</HI>
Company, without any prospect of Advanta∣ges.
Abundance of Sick were also Shipp'd on
Board the Vessel, to be carried to the Isle of <HI>Bur∣bon,</HI>
for the recovery of their Health, with whom
I embark'd, in the Ship called the <HI>Crown,</HI> Com∣manded
by Captain <HI>Lovet,</HI> and set Sail in the be∣ginning
of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>The difficulty we met with at our going out of
the Bay <HI>Dauphine,</HI> was a sure presage of the Mis∣fortunes
that befell us afterwards, in our passage
from <HI>Madagascar</HI> to <HI>Mascareigne,</HI> which we could
not accomplish till after a most troublesome and
tedious Voyage of 30 Days; whereas, with a fair
Gale it may be performed in five: abundance of our

Sick Men died, in the mean while, we lost our

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were reduced to that extremity for want of

<P>The cause of these Disasters being in a great mea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re
attributed to the ill Conduct of the Captain,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere arose a Mutiny in the Ship, so that we had

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Bay of Antongil, and our return to
Fort Dauphine.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bay of <HI>Antongil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Bay of <HI>Anton∣gil.</HI></NOTE> is one of the most con∣siderable
in the whole World, for its bigness,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> firmness of its bottom, and the secure station
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ships, which are sheltered here against the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iolent Tempests; besides that the fertility of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rcumjacent Country, renders it one of the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvenient places for Ships to furnish themselves
with all manner of Refreshments. The Bay is 15
Leagues long, at its Entrance 3 broad, in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iddle 9, and so encreases gradually towards the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoar. It is able to contain a great number of
Ships, and comprehends within its Circuit several
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Islands, among which, the most considerable
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s called <HI>Maroca;</HI> Near this Island most of the
Ships come to an Anchor, as being sheltred against
the Winds from all sides. The South and East
Winds are most favourable to further the En∣trance
of Ships into this Bay; but on the other
hand, they are directly opposite to those who
are to come out; so that these Winds being very
frequent here, you may enter without much diffi∣culty
in a few Hours, but it will require often∣times
some Months before you can get out again.
They are as much pestered here with continual
Rains, as they are at the Isle of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, neither
is the Air much better; the people hereabouts
Live like the rest of the Inhabitants of <HI>Madagas∣car;</HI>
but that their Religion comes somewhat nea∣rer
to Mahometism; the Men are here Jealous of
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
their Wives, even to a degree of Madness, and
punish Adultery with Death: They never eat a∣ny
Swines-Flesh, and have such an Aversion to
this Creature, that if one chances to Die, they Bu∣ry
it very deep under Ground, least they should
be defiled by the smell, as they pass by. They
esteem Gold and Silver, no more than they do
Tin and Copper.</P>
<P>We catch'd here abundance of Wild-Fowl, and
reckoning the Commodities we Truckt with them,
at the rate they Cost us in <HI>France,</HI> we did not pay
for a good Fowl above one Penny.</P>
<P>After we had got on Board as much as we had
occasion for at present, we doubled the uttermost
Cape of the Bay, in order to our return to St.
<HI>Mary</HI>'s, where we also continu'd no longer,
than was absolutely requisite to Embark those we
came to fetch away. Some that were Married in
the Country, chose rather to stay behind, than to
leave their Wives,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leave</HI> St. Mary'<HI>s.</HI></NOTE> which the Captain would not
take on Board; and the next day after we set
Sail from the Island, we came to an Anchor in the
Road of <HI>Galamboule,</HI> where there is always a high
Sea, let the Weather be never so fair. After we
had Embark'd all the <HI>French</HI> that were to go along
with us, we blew up the Fort, at the sight of
which, and the Embarkment of the Canon, the
<HI>Negroes</HI> dreading the Cruelties of the Neighbour∣ing
Mountainers, their irreconcilable Enemies, af∣ter
our Departure, broke out into most horrible
outcries, and gave us all the possible Demonstra∣tions
of their utmost Despair. Their miserable
Condition moving us to Compassion, we took as
many of them as our Ship would hold, on Board
of us, endeavouring to comfort the rest with some
Presents, and the hopes of a speedy return, in or∣der
to deliver them out of the Hands of their E∣nemies.</P>
<P>Thus we quitted this dangerous Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaves</HI> Galam∣boule.</NOTE> on the
Twenty first of <HI>June,</HI> with a very favourable Gale,
so that on the Twenty sixth of the same Month,
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
we were within sight of the point of <HI>Itapere,</HI>
which is only 3 Leagues distant from Fort <HI>Dau∣phine.</HI></P>
<P>The Pilots frequenting these Coasts, are always
very careful to come to an Anchor towards Night,
near this Point, and to stay till Day-light, the
better to avoid the Rocks that are at the Entrance
of the Bay <HI>Dauphine;</HI> but our Pilot being fool∣hardy,
continu'd his Course all the Night, so that
at break of Day, beside the danger we had esca∣ped,
of being lost upon the Shelves and Rocks,
we found our selves a great way below the Bay.
The worst of all was, that being encouraged by
the hopes of a speedy Passage, we had not ma∣naged
our Provisions to the best Advantage, so
that having nothing left, but a small quantity of
Rice, we began to consult what was most expe∣dient
to be done in this present emergency; then
it was at last resolved to approach the Shoar, and
to Land all those whom we had brought along
with us from St. <HI>Mary's</HI> and <HI>Galamboule.</HI> Pursu∣ant
to this Resolution, we came to an Anchor in
the Bay of <HI>Galleons,</HI> which received its Name from
some <HI>Portuguese</HI> Galleons that were lost near this
place. This Bay being not above 3 Leagues from
Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> we only stay'd for Day-light, that
we might with the more conveniency disembark
our Men; where on a sudden, a fresh Gale ari∣sing
from the West, we immediately set Sail, and
after some small difficulties, which we easily sur∣mounted,
entred the so much desired Fort about
Noon, on the 5th of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>So soon as we found our selves in a place of se∣curity,
the whole Ships Crew made their Com∣plaints
against the Captain, who being immedi∣ately
dispossess'd, Monsieur <HI>Lambety,</HI> who had for∣merly
Commanded the Ship, was put in his
place.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure from Madagascar to the

<P>THE New Captain received immediate Or∣ders
to have his Ship refitted, and to prepare
every thing for his Voyage to the <HI>Indies,</HI> whither
he was to go in Company with the <HI>Mazarine</HI> Fri∣gat,
and a Hoy called the St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>The Season being very far advanced, we got
every thing in readiness with the utmost diligence;
so that all the three Ships being in a Sailing posture
by the 12th of <HI>August,</HI> we doubled the most Sou∣thern
Cape of the Isle <HI>Dauphine,</HI> with a North-East
Wind, blowing a fresh Gale; the <HI>Mazarine</HI> Fri∣gat
being an Old Ship, lost her Main Top-Mast,
and her Main-Yard, of which Accidents we were
quickly advertised in our Ship; but our Orders
being to make the best of our way to <HI>Suratte,</HI> we
did not stay for the rest, but pursued our Voyage
alone. The Wind proved as favourable to us as
we could have wish'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of <HI>St. Austin.</HI></NOTE> so that making use of all
our Sails, we pass'd in sight of the Bay of St. <HI>Au∣stin,</HI>
a good Port belonging to the Isle of <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI>
Situate on the West side of the Island, un∣der
the five and Twentieth Degree of Southern
Latitude; from whence we steer'd our Course to
the Isle of <HI>Don John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isle of</HI> Don John.</NOTE> where we intended to re∣fresh
our selves. The <HI>Portugueses</HI> have given the
Island this Name, after him who was the first dis∣coverer
of it. It is Situate betwixt the Continent
of <HI>Africa</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> near 3 or
4 other Islands, the most considerable of which,
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
is called <HI>Majota.</HI> We were scarce come within
sight of it, when being becalmed, the violence of
the Current drove us upon the Rocks, which sur∣rounded
this Island, where we must have infalli∣bly
perished, if the Calm had continued a little
longer; but there arising a Gale, we continued
our Voyage, without pursuing our design of re∣freshing
our selves, for feat of a new Acci∣dent.</P>
<P>We passed pretty near the Isle of <HI>Socotora,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of <HI>So∣cotora</HI></NOTE> Situ∣ate
not far from the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> from whence we have
the best Aloes. Here we were again becalmed
for some days, which being followed by a furious
Tempest, carried away our Main Top-Mast.
Thus we pursued our Voyage without any remar∣kable
Accident, till the 18th of <HI>September,</HI> where
we met with the St. <HI>John</HI> Hoy, on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coast;
We were parted from her the first day of our
Voyage, and being in want of Provisions, she fur∣nished
us with some, and so we continued our
Voyage together to <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Shoar about <HI>Suratte</HI> being very low, we
were very careful in sounding frequently the depths;
notwithstanding which precaution, we passed over,
the Sand Banks lying betwixt <HI>Diu</HI> and <HI>Daman,</HI> be∣longing
to the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> of which we shall have
occasion to speak hereafter, from the 18th to the
20th of <HI>September,</HI> being misguided by the unskil∣fulness
of our Pilot; Our Vessels being but very
small and not heavy Laden, we escaped this dan∣ger,
without receiving the least damage.</P>
<P>Towards Night, we discovered the Ships riding
at Anchor in the Road of <HI>Suratte,</HI> before we could
discover the Land; and, as the late danger we had
so narrowly escaped, made us act with more cir∣cumspection,
we cast Anchor till break of
Day.</P>
<P>The 21st we Arrived in the Road, about two
Leagues distant from the Rivers Mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive in the Road of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> and about
5 from the City of <HI>Suratte;</HI> We sent immediately
several <HI>Chaloups</HI> to give notice of our Arrival.
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
But scarce had we lost sight of them, but a violent
Tempest arising from the West, we did not ima∣gine
otherwise, but that they must infallibly be
lost, before they could reach the Shoar. The fu∣ry
of the Winds encreasing every Minute, we
cast out all our Anchors, they being the only hopes
we had left, without which we must have been
cast upon the Sand, and destroyed immediately,
this Hurricane being one of those the <HI>Indians</HI> call
the <HI>Elephant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Hurri∣cane.</NOTE> by reason of its violence.</P>
<P>We had at last once more the good fortune to
escape this danger, the Winds having abated their
fury; and to add to our good fortune, all our
Messengers Arrived safely at <HI>Suratte,</HI> to the no

Pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, and Sea-Men, to assist us in making the
River, but they did not come on Board of us till
the 23d. The St. <HI>John</HI> Hoy having been driven
in the last Storm upon a Sand Bank, had also the
good fortune to get clear by the help of the
Tyde.</P>
<P>With the assistance of those sent us from <HI>Suratte,</HI>
we made the River, which however by reason of
the swiftness of the Current we did not enter with∣out
much difficulty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive near the City of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> but at last Arrived safely near
the Garden of the Company, which is not above

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the City of Suratte.</HEAD>
<P>THE City is Situate under the one and Twen∣tieth
Degree of North Latitude, and is one of
the most considerable Ports in the Empire of the
<HI>Great Mogul.</HI> It is very large and populous, Built
upon the Banks of a fair River, which runs under
its Walls, and about 3 Leagues from thence dis∣embogues
into the Sea. When I Arrived near the
City, the Gates were not shut up; the Inhabi∣tants
were obliged for their Security to a neigh∣bouring
Prince called <HI>Sevagi,</HI> who by his frequent
Incursions has caused them to surround their City
with a good Wall, and to be constantly upon
their Guard. The Sand Banks which are at the
Entrance of this River, are very uncertain, being
by the violence of the Current frequently transpo∣sed
from one place to another, so that they are
rarely to be met withal two Years together in the
same place, which renders the passage of Ships both
very troublesome and dangerous.</P>
<P>The Streets of <HI>Suratte</HI> are handsome enough,
but they have this inconvenience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> that they are ve∣ry
dusty during the dry Season, which the <HI>Indians</HI>
call their Summer, tho' all the time the Sun is at
the greatest distance from them. To remedy this,
they continually water the Streets, especially in
those parts where the better sort Inhabit. The Hou∣ses
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>
are here but one Story high, those of the com∣mon
people are covered with Tiles; but people of
Fashions Houses are flat at Top, with Terrace
Walks, made with a certain sort of Plaster; which
appears as beautiful as White Marble, and keeps
out the Rain, they have only a little rising in the
middle, for the better convenience of conveying
the Water into the Streets; abundance of people
pass whole Nights upon these Terraces, to enjoy
the benefit of the cool Air.</P>
<P>All Houses of people of any Fashion, have their
Gardens surrounded with fine Arbours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Gar∣dens.</NOTE> bearing
Grapes twice a Year. Besides which, they have
great store of all sorts of Flowers, but especially
those they call <HI>Mougrin,</HI> which being not unlike
our <HI>Jassamin</HI> Flowers, are in great request among
the <HI>Indians.</HI> They have also certain Trees bearing
Flowers, which open at Sun-Rising, and fall off
at Sun-Set; and others of which the Flowers open
at Sun-Set, and decay at Sun-rising; and the whole
Year being but one continued Spring Season in this
Climate, furnishes them always with all sorts of
Fruits and Flowers.</P>
<P>People of Quality, nay, even those of an Inferi∣our
Rank, have their Bathing places, which being
made all of Stone, are extreamly neat. They
make use of them partly upon the account of their
Religion, partly to allay the violence of the heat
of the Climate.</P>
<P>The <HI>French, English,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> Inhabit the best
Houses in <HI>Suratte,</HI> those of the <HI>Armenians</HI> are no
less Sumptuous, and all of them are very pleasantly
Seated.</P>
<P><HI>Suratte</HI> is a place of great Commerce; Their
Diamonds are brought thither out of the Kingdom
of <HI>Golconda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com∣merce.</NOTE> which is Tributary to the <HI>Great-Mogul;</HI>

<HI>Good-Hope,</HI> as Musk and Civet come out of <HI>China,</HI>
the last of which, is taken from a certain Creature

bearing the same Name. There is besides this at
<HI>Suratte,</HI> a great Trade in Silk, and Gold and Sil∣ver
brocados, in the finest Cottons in the World,
in Indico and all sorts of Druggs, which are the
products either of the <HI>Indies</HI> or <HI>Arabia.</HI> Their Spi∣ces
they have from the <HI>Indies, Malaca</HI> furnishes
them with Nutmegs, <HI>Macasar</HI> with Clove-Gilly-flowers,
the Isle of <HI>Ceilon</HI> with Cinnamon, all the
Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> with Pepper; so that there is no∣thing
so precious or rare, but the Ware-Houses of
<HI>Suratte</HI> are sufficiently provided with it.</P>
<P>The Governour of the whole Province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gover∣nour's Court.</NOTE> which
is of a very large extent, has his Residence in this
City; He keeps a very Splendid Court, is atten∣ded
by a strong Guard, Consisting of several Com∣panies

he is carried by an Elephant, upon whose Neck,
is fastned a Tent, big enough to contain 12 or
more persons, according to the bigness of the Beast.
Sometimes he is carried in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> which is a

<P>The Place of the Governour of <HI>Suratte</HI> is not
Hereditary, and is seldom continued for above 4
or 5 Years to the same Person. On the West side
of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle.</NOTE> there is an Old Castle, surrounded
with a very deep Ditch. There is always a strong
Garrison kept here, under its own Governour,
who has no dependance on him of the City.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Europeans</HI> keep some Canons near their
Houses, wherewith they defend themselves against

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A further Description of Suratte.</HEAD>
<P>ABout a quarter of a League from <HI>Suratte,</HI> there
is a great <HI>Tancke</HI> or Cistern, made of Free-Stone.
It was Built by a Rich <HI>Banjan,</HI> and is of
a great Circumference; you go into it by a fair
pair of Stairs, and in the middle you see a little
Temple Consecrated to their Gods, unto whom,
they offer their Prayers, after they have Bathed
themselves. The Walks leading to it are very fine∣ly
Planted with Trees, and are look'd upon as the
most pleasant of the whole Country. There are
also about <HI>Suratte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Gardens.</NOTE> publick Gardens, which being
very neatly kept, want nothing that may recreate
the Eye, and are of free access for every Bo∣dy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banjans</HI> Inhabiting <HI>Suratte,</HI> are indeed the
Richest, and have the chief management of the
Traffick throughout the <HI>Indies;</HI> nevertheless, the
<HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Mahometans</HI> live in much more splendor.
If a person of Quality happens to pass through the
City, upon any Solemn occasion, he has his Trum∣pets
before him, which being 8 or 10 Foot long,
and proportionable in bigness, make a pleasant and
Warlike Harmony.</P>
<P>After the Example of these, Foreigners who bear
any considerable Office have the Arms of the
<PB N="41" REF="36"/>
Princes or Common-wealths, whom they serve,
carried before them, and have likewise their Trum∣pets,
which attend them where ever they go.</P>
<P>At about a League distant from the City, there
is a Village which is inhabited only by <HI>Persians</HI> or
<HI>Parsis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Village inhabited by <HI>Persi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> who adore the Sun and Fire; hither the In∣habitants
of <HI>Suratte</HI> come frequently to drink Palm-Wine,
which they call <HI>Tary.</HI> It is a most delicious
sort of Liquor; how it is made, I shall have occa∣sion
to mention hereafter. All round the City is a
fair, champagne and fertile Country; they Sow to∣wards
the end of <HI>September,</HI> when the rainy Season
is over, abundance of Wheat, which they reap in
<HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of <HI>Suratte</HI> is very good; it is never cold
here, and the heats are pretty tolerable.</P>
<P>The Port of <HI>Sovaly</HI> is about four Leagues to the
<HI>North-West,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Harbour of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> this is the place where all Foreign Ships
come to Anchor, but they can scarce abide there
longer than from <HI>October</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> the rest of the
Year being very dangerous for Ships, by rea∣son
of the frequent Tempests and changeableness of
the Winds. There are a great many fair Villages
round the Harbours, among which <HI>Sovaly</HI> has com∣municated
its Name to the Port, is the most consi∣derable.
Here most of the <HI>European</HI> Companies
have their Ware-houses and Offices, which they a∣dorn
with the Arms of their Principals to whom
they belong. The <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Subjects are not
permitted to enter the Port or <HI>Sovaly,</HI> for fear they
should defraud him of the Customs, none but the
<HI>Europeans</HI> enjoy this Privilege. These draw to this
Village great number of <HI>Banjans, Moors</HI> and <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI>
who during the time, that the <HI>European</HI> Vessels
tarry in this Port, set up their Booths, which be∣ing
put in good order, and divided into seve∣ral
Streets, make up a kind of a moveable Village,
where they sell every thing, which may be useful
to the Foreign Mariners. There hapned some
years before my arrival, an unlucky accident to a
<HI>Frenchman</HI> in this Port, which had been likely to
<PB N="42" REF="37"/>
have proved of very ill consequence. A <HI>Mahome∣tan</HI>
came on board a <HI>French</HI> Vessel to cheapen some
things, and amongst the rest, asked them, whether
they had any Pistols to sell? Several pair having
been shew'd him, he went to discharge one of them
out of a Window in the Cabin, but he, who was
the Seller, finding him very unexpert in handling
of Fire-arms, took one and discharged it himself;
but the Pistol being charged with three Bullets, he
unfortunately shot a young Child which was play∣ing
a shoar, through the Breast, of which it died
instantly. The news of this unfortunate accident
was soon spread, not only through the Village, but
in <HI>Suratte</HI> it self, where the Rabble began to be mu∣tinous,
and to declare publickly, that they would
not rest satisfied, till they had Sacrificed all the <HI>French</HI>
in <HI>Suratte,</HI> and had revenged the Death of the Child
upon a Nation, who made killing and slaying their
Pass-time; so that for several days together, no
<HI>Frenchman</HI> durst stir out of the Doors. At last, the
Person, who by his carelessness had been the occasi∣on
of this unfortunate accident, having by some of
his Friends convinced them of his innocence, the
matter was accommodated, and the Tumult ceased.
For it hapned, that the Child that was killed, be∣longed
to <HI>Pagan</HI> Parents, so that they were appeas∣ed
by the means of a Sum of Money, under condi∣tion,
that the who had committed the Fact, should
not be permitted to come ashoar, but to return into
<HI>Europe,</HI> by the same Vessel that had brought him
thither. If this Child had been a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> he
would not have come off at so easie a rate, but
would have been in no small danger of his Life, it
being an indispensable Law, and always religiously
observed among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> that if a Foreign∣er,
but especially a Christian, kills a <HI>Musulman</HI>
(a name which all the <HI>Mahometans</HI> assume, signify∣ing
as much as a true Believer) he must expiate
the crime by his Death.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their different Religions.</HEAD>
<P>TO give an exact account here of all the Sects
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> would be too tedious, if not
quite impossible. The <HI>Christian</HI> Faith was first
planted in those parts by St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and that Apo∣stle
sealed the truth of the Gospel which he had
Preached to these Infidels with his Blood. On the
Coast of <HI>Cormandel</HI> it is preserved in its purity to
this day; and before these People entred into com∣merce
with the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> they only made use of
the Gospel of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> in those <HI>Eastern</HI> parts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians in the <HI>In∣dies.</HI></NOTE>
but after the rest were Communicated to them,
they were not a little surprized, that so many great
and powerful Nations, were enlightned by the Go∣spel,
and adored the Name of Jesus Christ, as well
as themselves: It is true, there is some difference
in the ceremonial part, but the substance of their
Religion is the same with ours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> who have sufficiently testified
their Zeal for the propagating of the <HI>Christian</HI> Do∣ctrine,
have made considerable progresses in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
towards the Establishment of <HI>Christianity;</HI> no∣thing
can be more compleat than their Churches
and Monasteries, but their Zeal is involved in no
small difficulties, which obstructs their pious En∣deavours.</P>
<P>The severity of the Inquisition establish'd in all
places under the obedience of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquisition.</NOTE>
Holy by its Name, but so terrible in its Conse∣quences,
serves for nothing else than to abalienate
the Infidels from the <HI>Christian</HI> Church.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="38"/>
Though the <HI>Christians</HI> are not allowed the pub∣lick
Exercise of their Religion, in the Territories▪
under the jurisdiction of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> neverthe∣less
they are not debarr'd from Worshipping Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in private. There are certain private Convents, such
a one the <HI>French Capuchins</HI> have at <HI>Suratte;</HI> but they
are forbidden under pain of Death to teach any
thing to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> which may induce them
to embrace the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith, and if a <HI>Mahomet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
be suspected to have received the least tincture of
<HI>Christianity,</HI> he is Condemned to the Flames, un∣less
he will save his life by a publick Profession of
Mahometism.</P>
<P>There are at <HI>Suratte</HI> a great Number of <HI>Armenia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Christians, of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, who have their
Churches, as well as the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> the <HI>Eng∣lish,
Dutch,</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> Nations; but the
Sect of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is the most prodominant in the
<HI>Indies,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> both for its number
and strength. The Great Mogul himself, is a <HI>Ma∣hometan,</HI>
and most of his Subject, follow his Foot∣steps.</P>
<P>There is also in the <HI>Indies</HI> another sort of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parsis <HI>in the</HI> Indies.</NOTE>
called <HI>Parsis</HI> or <HI>Perse,</HI> descended from the race of
the Antient <HI>Persians,</HI> who being forced out of their
Native Country by the first <HI>Mahometans,</HI> endea∣voured
to preserve their lives from the rage of their
Enemies by flight. They were toss'd upon the Sea,
for a considerable time, and many of them being
lost in their Voyage, three of their Vessels came to
the <HI>Indian</HI> shoar, whereof the first set up themselves
near <HI>Suratte,</HI> the second at <HI>Dieu,</HI> and the third at
<HI>Gandavy,</HI> a Town betwixt <HI>Suratte</HI> and <HI>Daman.</HI> They
are neither very Numerous nor Rich, one of the
fundamental Rules of their Faith is, not to wear a∣ny
other Arms but a little Knife; they respect and
adore the Sun, and the Firelike Deities, and they look
upon it as a great crime to extinguish a Candle, or
at least they must do it by a sudden Agitation of
the Candle, if they would not have it burn any
longer. Their Lamps and Fire-places are their

<P>The <HI>Banjans</HI> are the next in order,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ban∣jans.</NOTE> but they are

that so soon as the Soul leaves the Body, it
is transplanted into another; for which reason it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that they neither kill, nor permit to be kill'd, any
living Creature: And some are so simple, as to di∣stribute

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Indian Women burn themselves
with the dead Carcasses of their Husbands.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Indian</HI> Histories affirm, That in former A∣ges
these Countries being Governed by <HI>Pagan</HI>
Princes, the Women often grown weary of their
Husbands, made a common practice of ridding their
hands of them by Poison.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this Custom was introduced.</NOTE> The many tragical in∣stances
of this Nature, did oblige at last those Princes
who were not always exempt from the cruel designs
of the Women, to make a Law, that all Women of
what Age and Quality soever, should be burnt with
the dead Carcasses of their Husbands. To give the
better colour to this cruel Decree, it was back'd by
the specious pretext of Religion, promising a large
share of Enjoyment to those unfortunate Creatures,
in the other World. Besides, that the <HI>Bramans</HI> paid
them very near the same reverence as to their Dei∣ties,
by which vain glory the crafty Priests having
gained upon the Weakness of their Sex, they fre∣quently
chose to make a vertue of necessity, and by
<PB N="48" REF="40"/>
a voluntary Act, to render their Deaths more glo∣rious.</P>
<P>Many Ages after the <HI>Mahometans</HI> being become
Masters of the greatest part of the <HI>Indies,</HI> were for
abolishing this dreadful Custom of forcing People to
be their own Executioners; for which reason it was
ordained, that none should be constrained to
Sacrifice themselves at their Husbands Funerals, but
that they should be left to their liberty, either to sur∣vive
or die with them.</P>
<P>The Governours are in Person to examine such of
the <HI>Pagan</HI> Women as offer themselves to be Burnt;
they are to endeavour by all fair means and perswa∣sions,
to divert them from their designs, and if they
persist in their Resolution, they are obliged to give
their consent, but withall to keep them under a
strict Guard, for fear, that if they should happen
to change their mind, they may not be rescued out
of their hands. They look upon this as a very ne∣cessary
precaution, the better to oblige them to re∣flect
seriously upon what they undertake, before
they enter upon so fatal a Resolution; for there have
not been wanting instances of those, who at first
courted and demanded Death from the Governours
with an undaunted Courage, who have been start∣led
and trembled at the sight of the Funeral Pile,
and too late repented themselves of their rash Vows.</P>
<P>The Ceremony is performed in the following
manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Ceremony is perform∣ed.</NOTE> The Corps of the deceased Husband is car∣ried
to the place where it is to be consumed by Fire,
the Inhabitants of <HI>Surat</HI> perform it commonly at a
Leagues distance from the City up the River, in a
certain place, called <HI>Soulpara,</HI> where there is one of
the most famous Temples of the whole Province,
it being their Custom upon such an occasion, to be as
near a Temple and the Water as they can; then
the Widow is brought thither in Triumph on Horse
Back, most magnificently attired with a Garland of
Flowers about her Head; she is surrounded by se∣veral
that play upon Musical Instruments, and fol∣lowed
by her Kindred and Friends, who Dance and
<PB N="49" REF="40"/>
Sing for joy, to have such a Heroine in their Fami∣ly,
or to be allyed to her by Friendship. Some∣times
they are carried by Water; when the dead
Corps is laid in the Boat, so as that the Widow,
who is seated upon a Chair, may set her Feet a∣gainst
it.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the place, the dead Corps is laid
upon the Bank of the River, where the Widow
washes it; which done, it is carried into a little
Hut of seven or eight foot square, made for that
purpose of very dry Wood, covered with Reed,
dip'd in Oil, Rosin and Brimstone, to render it the
more Combustible; it has a little Door through
which the dead Body being conveyed into the place,
the Widow comes out of the Water, and thus wet,
takes several rounds about the Funeral Pile, which
done, she embraces her Children, if she have any,
and the rest of her Kindred or Friends there present,
among whom having distributed what precious
moveables she has about her, they are removed at a
further distance, for fear their Tears should disturb
her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they burn them∣selves.</NOTE> Thus prepared she enters the fatal place,
where she is to sacrifice her self, and being seated
upon a heap of Straw, mix'd with Brimstone, near
the dead Carcass of her Husband, a <HI>Braman</HI> exhorts
her to constancy, comforting her with the hopes of
being soon reunited with her own better half; then
he gives her a Torch in one hand, and some leaves
of a Book in which he has been reading before in
the other, if her heart don't fail her, she sets the Pile
on fire her self, but if she be not courageous enough
to do it, the <HI>Braman</HI> after being come out, and shut∣ting
the door behind him, does her this last office,
whilst the Spectators sing certain Songs to the Ho∣nour
and Praise of the Lady, who thus happily has
made her self a Sacrifice.</P>
<P>The first time that I was an Eye-witness of this
Tragical Ceremony, I took most particular notice
of all Passages and Circumstances that attend it; she
that sacrificed her self, did not appear to be above
twenty Years of Age; she look'd upon her Funeral▪
<PB N="50" REF="41"/>
Pile with a very setled▪ Countenance, shewing not
the least marks of sorrow at her approaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate;
she with her own hands set fire to the combustible
matter that surrounded her; I was very near the
Pile, so that I could exactly see her lift up her de∣ceased
Husband's Head, and press her Cheeks to his,
which done, she pulled her Veil over her Face,
and died without the least appearance of regret.</P>
<P>Some time after, I saw such another Spectacle.
She that was to be sacrificed, was not quite so young
as the former, and had press'd the Execution of her
Vow with a great deal of Resolution, which how∣ever
began to fail her at that very time when she
stood most in need of it; for, scarce was she en∣closed
within the Funeral Pile, but she strove by all
means possible to get out, but the <HI>Braman</HI> immedi∣ately
set fire to the Combustible Materials, and thus
forced her to undergo that cruel fate, which she had
sought for with so much eagerness. So soon as the
Bodies are consumed by the Fire, their Ashes are
thrown into the next River, and the Families of
those Women who thus have sacrificed themselves,
are in great esteem ever after among the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>In those places where the <HI>Pagans</HI> are absolute Ma∣sters,
this Law is put in Execution with the utmost
severity, the Women that don't voluntarily offer
themselves to be sacrificed, being constrained by
force, to satisfie the cruel Law of their Native
Country.</P>
<P>But what is the most surprising of all, is, That
sometimes Men very far advanced in Years, marry
young Creatures of seven or eight years of Age, and
these notwithstanding the innocence and tender∣ness
of their Age, are forced to conform themselves
to the barbarous custom of their Country, if their
Husbands die before them.</P>
<P>There are some Kingdoms in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
these Sacrifices are performed in a different manner.
They dig a deep hole in the Ground, wherein they lay
the dead Corps; they make a great Fire round about
it, for three days consecutively; the Widow is led
<PB N="51" REF="41"/>
round about it, covered with a certain Veil, made
out of the Leaves of the <HI>Banana</HI>-Tree, and after
having taken her turns and bid farewell to all her
Friends, She throws her self into the Fire, where
She is consumed to Ashes.</P>
<P>Others dig a Grave,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several ways of Sa∣crificing themselves.</NOTE> wherein they Bury the
Dead Carcass of the Husband, and the Widow
being laid a-top of him, they throw so much Earth
upon them as covers her Body quite up to the
Neck; then the <HI>Braman</HI> approaches, and after ha∣ving
imparted to the poor Victim his Consolations
and Blessing, he Strangles her, and then covers
them all over with Earth.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Maudre</HI> has seldom less than 3 or
400 Wives, who are all obliged to be Sacrificed,
whenever he comes to Die.</P>
<P>There is another more Barbarous Custom ob∣served
at the Funeral Obsequies of the Princes of
the Race of <HI>Sevagi;</HI> for, all the Officers of his
Houshold (which amount to a considerable num∣ber,)
are Burnt with their Dead Corps; the same is
observed in several of the other petty Kingdoms of
the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

and indifferently Built. They abhorr Images, and
<PB N="52" REF="42"/>
have only one hollow place in their Mosques, to∣wards
the side of <HI>Mecha.</HI> And because the <HI>Ma∣hometans</HI>
who are very Zealous in their Superstiti∣ous
Worship, have not always the opportunity of
visiting their principal Mosques, they have e∣rected
every where some small edifices, which
contain no more than a Cistern or great Basin to
purifie themselves, and a hole in the Wall, where
to make their Ejaculations; all these are intitled
with the Name of a Mosque, and in this Sence
must be taken, what we hear related concerning
the vast number of Mosques in the City of <HI>Grand-Cairo,</HI>
and other Cities where the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Reli∣gion
is predominant.</P>
<P>According to the Institution of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the
<HI>Friday</HI> is their <HI>Sunday,</HI> which Day, being set apart
for the Exercise of their Devotion, they there offer
up their Prayers and Alms.</P>
<P>The Temples of the <HI>Pagans</HI> are without the Ci∣ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pagan <HI>Temples.</HI></NOTE>
tho' some of the Richer sort have them also in
their Dwelling-Houses, they are commonly very
large and Magnificent; all days are alike to them,
and the Offerings they make to their Gods consist
always in things that are inanimate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parsis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Parsis.</NOTE> who, as we said before, adore the Sun
and Fire, have neither Altars nor any other places
appointed for the Exercise of their Devotion. The
Image of the Sun, was formerly their Idol, but e∣ver
since they live under the jurisdiction of the
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> they are forbidden to adore it, and
if some among them continue this Worship,
they must do it in private, and with a great deal
of circumspection for fear of being discovered.</P>
<P>All the Subjects of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> wear Tur∣bans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit of the <HI>Indi∣ans.</HI></NOTE>
tho' somewhat distinguished in folding ac∣cording
to the difference of their Religion. The
<HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Parsis,</HI> never Shave their Beards.</P>
<P>The Men wear a certain kind of Vests, not un∣like
to our loose Coats, the Sleeves are very strait,
but withal so long as to be laid in a great many
pleats upon the Arm. They make use of a kind
<PB N="53" REF="42"/>
of Drawers or Breeches, very strait, not open be∣fore,
and reaching down to their Heels; the <HI>Pa∣gans</HI>
wear over these a thin Petticoat. Stockings
are not used in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and their Shooes are flat∣soled
like our Slippers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Women are very careful of their Hair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahome∣tan <HI>Women.</HI></NOTE>
which generally is very fine and long. Their
Habit is but little different from the Men, unless
it be in their Head Attire, which is made of a
Crepine of Lawn. They are very curious and
neat in their Apparel, and always perfumed with
the richest Essences of the <HI>Indies.</HI> The never ap∣pear
in publick with their Faces uncovered, the
<HI>Mahometans</HI> being naturally addicted to Jealousie,
to so excessive a degree, as to be mistrustful upon
the least occasion; of which I will give you an
instance, which may sufficiently verifie this asser∣tion,
to all who are not thoroughly acquainted
with their Inclinations.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Suratte</HI> tenderly loved one
of his Wives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealousie of the <HI>Maho∣metans.</HI></NOTE> by reason of her extraordinary
Beauty, wherein she exceeded all the rest. Being
sometimes obliged to be absent from her, he was
very desirous to have her Picture drawn, and un∣derstanding
that there was a certain young Picture-drawer
belonging to the <HI>French East-India</HI> Compa∣ny,
at <HI>Suratte,</HI> who was a very good Artist, he
sent to the President of that Company to desire him
to let him speak with the young Man. They be∣ing
ready to oblige him in so reasonable a request,
sent the young Painter to him, to whom he spoke
concerning his intention, promising to reward him
plentifully for his pains. The <HI>French</HI> Man retur∣ned
his Compliment, telling him, <HI>That he should
be very Proud of employing his Pencil in the drawing
the Picture of so Excellent a Person, without any hopes
of further Rewards;</HI> Then reply'd the <HI>Indian, go to
Work as soon as you please, and make use of your utmost
Skill to do it to perfection.</HI> I will, answer'd the Pain∣ter,
<HI>but you must take care to have me brought into
the presence of the Person, whose Picture I am to draw.</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="43"/>
How, said the Governor, interrupting his Discourse
angrily, <HI>would you pretend to have a Sight of my Wife!
And how is it possible for me to draw her Picture with∣out
seeing her,</HI> answer'd the Painter. <HI>Away with you,</HI>
reply'd the jealous <HI>Indian, you have no business here,
if you cannot draw her Picture without seeing her; I
will rather deny my self the satisfaction of having her
Picture, than that she should be exposed to the Sight
of any Man Living.</HI> By this you may see to what
an excess of folly the <HI>Mahometans</HI> carry their Jea∣lousie;
notwithstanding which, the Women don't
want ingenuity and dexterity to please themselves
upon certain occasions, in spite of all the care and
watchfulness of their Jealous Husbands.</P>
<P>The Women of the <HI>Parsis,</HI> and other <HI>Pagans,</HI>
wear nothing else but close Bodice fastned behind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pagan <HI>Women.</HI></NOTE>
the Sleeves reaching only to the Elbow: For the
rest they make use of a piece of Stuff, either of
Cotton or Silk, according to their Quality, which
they wind about their middle. They are general∣ly
very handsome, much addicted to Venery, un∣less
it be those of the <HI>Banjans,</HI> who are something
more Modest. They affect a great deal of Mag∣nificence
in their Jewels, and besides their Neckla∣ces
and Bracelets, wear on their Feet Golden-Rings
hollow within, and fill'd with Gravel or any other
thing that will make a noise. Their Heads are a∣dorned
with small Golden Coronets, richly beset
with Precious Stones. They have holes in their
Ears, in which they wear their Pendants, and in
their Nostrils, which are bored through, they hang
Gold and Silver Plates, of that bigness as almost to
cover their Faces. They are very clear Limb'd,
and well proportion'd; the richer sort Bath them∣selves
every day at home, the rest abroad in the
Rivers, where you meet with some of them from
Sun-rising till late at Night; where the <HI>Bramans</HI>
are employed to Pray for them, and to take care
of their Cloaths; I mean those, which they put
on after they have wash'd themselves; for they go
with their Cloaths into the River, and afterwards
<PB N="55" REF="43"/>
change them; which they do with so much dexte∣rity,
that the standers by, tho' never so attentive
and quick-sighted, cannot see the least thing which
favours of immodesty; They are very Religious
in observing their Ancient Laws and Customs, but
withall, extreamly addicted to Voluptuousness.</P>
<P>After 3 Months stay at <HI>Suratte,</HI> I Embark'd in the
Port of <HI>Sonaly,</HI> on Board a Vessel called the <HI>Mary,</HI>
which in Company of another Vessel called the

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure from Suratte for Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>WE set Sail from the Port of <HI>Sonaly</HI> the 6th of
<HI>January,</HI> with a very favourable Wind,
which thus continued till our Arrival at <HI>Rajapour,</HI>
where we left the <HI>Strong,</HI> and continued our Voyage
to <HI>Mirscou,</HI> and some other places in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
of which we shall have occasion to speak anon;
but because I have been at other times at <HI>Rajapour,</HI>
I will here insert what I found most worth taking
notice of, in this place.</P>
<P>It is Situate in the Territories of <HI>Sevagi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Raja∣pour.</HI></NOTE> a fa∣mous
Rebel, who for a considerable time has been
in Wars with the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the King of
<HI>Visapour</HI> his Liege Lord. It lies exactly under the
17th Degree of North Latitude, on the Coast of
<HI>Malabar,</HI> about 20 Leagues North from <HI>Goa;</HI> and
you come to it by a River, which runs with a very
gentle Current. Near the Mouth of it on the right
side of the Shoar, you see a small Village, Inha∣bited
only by Fisher-Men, and 4 Leagues beyond it
<PB N="56" REF="44"/>
is the City of <HI>Rajapour,</HI> which has Communicated
its Name to the said River. You may go up with
a Vessel of 100 Tuns, as far as to a small Island,
which is about half way betwixt the City and the
Mouth of the River; afterwards you make use of
<HI>Chaloups</HI> and Barges, to carry the Merchandice
to the City, where the River is so shallow that
at low Water it is fordable in some places.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> had here formerly a Factory, but
the <HI>Indians</HI> have dislodged them from thence. The
<HI>French</HI> Company has not many years ago got a
Settlement there, where they have a fine House
and Garden, near a great Cistern, from whence,
arises a Spring of Hot-Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural Bath of <HI>Rajapour.</HI></NOTE> not inferiour in ver∣tue
to any in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Adjacent Mountains
and Forests are full of Apes, which are much re∣verenced
by the <HI>Pagans,</HI> Inhabiting the Territo∣ries
of <HI>Sevagi,</HI> no body being permitted to kill
them, without running the Hazard of his Life.
The chief Commodities at <HI>Rajapour,</HI> are Saltperer
and Callicoes, but especially Pepper, which grows
thereabouts in great quantity.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sevagi</HI> is a very Potent Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Se∣vagi.</NOTE> who has
managed his Affairs with so much Prudence as to
have Establish'd himself, in spite of his Potent E∣nemies,
in all the Territories, Situate betwixt <HI>Su∣ratte</HI>
and <HI>Goa,</HI> unless it be some few Sea-Ports,
belonging to the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> He has made him∣self
so dreadful to his Neighbours, as to have
made the City of <HI>Goa</HI> it self Tremble at his Ap∣proach,
and has several times made those of <HI>Su∣ratte</HI>
feel the direful effects of his Fury, by Plun∣dering
all the Country round about, and carrying
away great Riches, without sparing either Mosques
or the <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples. But it has been observed
of him, that he always used a great deal of mode∣ration
towards the <HI>Europeans,</HI> perhaps for fear of
being called to a severe account by their Princi∣pals▪
which Motive might induce him to shew
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> favourable to them, without which, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been no difficult matter for him to
<PB N="57" REF="44"/>
have Plundered their Houses, like those of the <HI>In∣dians.</HI>
In the Year 1671. he made such an inroad
into the Territories of <HI>Suratte,</HI> when he made so
terrible a havock in the circumjacent places, that
the damage could not be repair'd for many Years
after. All his Strong holds are Built among the
Mountains; His Subjects are <HI>Pagans▪</HI> like himself.
But he Tolerates all Religions, and is look'd up∣on
as one of the most Politick Princes in those
parts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Strong</HI> being entred the River of <HI>Rajapour,</HI>
met there with another <HI>French</HI> Ship called the <HI>Gol∣den-Eagle,</HI>
which was Arrived there but a few days
before, coming from <HI>Achem,</HI> the Capital of the Isle
of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and the ordinary Residence of their
Queen, the Island being Governed by Women.
Before she touch'd at <HI>Achem,</HI> she had been at <HI>Ma∣susipatan,</HI>
a City belonging to the Kingdom of
<HI>Golconda,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> from whence
come the best Painted <HI>Indian</HI> Callicoes, the Co∣lour
of which, is as lasting as the Stuff it self, with∣out
losing any thing of its Beauty. The <HI>French
East-India</HI> Company have their Factors in all those
places.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What further happened during our Voyage to
Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>AS we continued our Course towards <HI>Malabar,</HI>
we passed within sight of the Forts Situate at
the Entrance of the River of <HI>Goa,</HI> whereof we shall
speak hereafter, and came before <HI>Mirscou,</HI> on the
14th, where we cast Anchor the same day, near the
Mouth of the River.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="45"/>
<HI>Mirscou</HI> is a City of the Kingdom of <HI>Visapour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirscou <HI>described.</HI></NOTE>
about 18 Leagues South of <HI>Goa,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI>
Company has their Ware-Houses for Pepper. The
Climate here is very agreeable and Fertile; the
first place you meet with after you are entred the
River, is the Town and Castle of <HI>Mirscou;</HI> it is
of a considerable bigness, surrounded with a deep
Moat, and the Castle is provided with a good Ar∣tillery.
He that was then Governour of the place,
was a <HI>Persian</HI> by Birth, who's Name being <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jab∣della,</HI>
treated us with all imaginable Civility. For
no sooner had he been advertised of our Arrival,
but he came to visit our Captain, and before his
departure invited us all to Supper, tho' it was not
as yet Dinner-time; he was so much delighted with
our Company, that he oblig'd us to go along with
him, so that we followed him to his Palace, some
in <HI>Palanquins,</HI> the rest on Horse-back, with his
Guards before us, under the sound of the Haut-boys
and Trumpets.</P>
<P>As soon as we were come within the Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Indian</HI> Feast.</NOTE> we
were brought into a spacious Room hang'd all o∣ver
with the richest Tapestries, where we were
seated round about him upon Cushions made of the
same stuff. Scarce had our Interpreters begun to
Compliment the Governour in our behalf, when
we saw come into the Room a Band of Women
Dancers, which he had ordred to appear there for our
Diversion; these Women make profession of Dan∣cing
and Singing, having no other Employment to
get a livelihood. They Dance with an extraordi∣nary
activity, and an exact observance of the Ca∣dence,
but their Gestures are not very modest, they
are generally well shaped, and appear very sump∣tuous
in their Apparel. This Ball which lasted the
greatest part of the Day, was diverting enough to
us, by reason of the Novelty of the Spectacle; but
we were extreamly fatigued by the long continu∣ance
of the shew, because we had not so much as
broke our fast before we came out, so that we had
much rather had a more substantial Entertainment,
<PB N="59" REF="45"/>
than that, which only served to divert our Eyes,
and all this time was not so entertaining to us, as a
good dish of Meat would have been. Night ap∣proaching
at last, we saw the Flambeau's brought
in, which put us in hopes, that Supper-time was
drawing near, especially when we saw our selves
conducted into the inner Court; but instead of Ta∣bles,
we saw the old sport of Dancing renewed▪
and this being over, we were entertained with an ar∣tificial
Fire-work, which lasted till ten a Clock at
Night, and almost put us quite out of Patience.
At last we were conducted to the place where we
were to Sup, the Table being laid upon the Ground
(according to the custom, as well of that, as other
<HI>Eastern</HI> Countries) under a very magnificent <HI>Cupo∣lo.</HI>
There was served up variety of most excellent
Meats, of which our hungry Stomacks would not
give us leave to distinguish the true relish; our
Drink was Fimonade, which was brought in great
porcelain Vessels, out of which we took the Li∣quor
with Spoons into small Glasses, of which eve∣ry
one present had one for his own use. The se∣cond
course was made up of the best Fruits of the
<HI>Indies</HI> and preserves, and the Feast being conclu∣ded
with the old Dancing sport, we did not take
our leave from the Governour till very late, who
caused us to be reconducted by his Guards and
Trumpets to the House belonging to the <HI>French</HI>
Company.</P>
<P>The next day we prayed him to come on board
our Ship, which lay in the Road. He came ac∣cording
to our Invitation, giving presents to every
Man in particular that had Supped with him. He
was received under the discharge of our Cannon,
and was entertained the whole day on board our
Ship. At his departure, we offered Him and his
Officers some presents (more valuable than his) in
the Name of the <HI>French East-India</HI> Company, which
he accepted; and went home as well satisfied with
our Entertainment, as we were with the many Ci∣vilities
he had shewn us the day before.</P>

makes profession of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, but
most of his Subjects are <HI>Pagans.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from before <HI>Mirscou</HI> the nineteenth of
<HI>January,</HI> five days after our Arrival, and the two
and twentieth of the same Month, arrived at <HI>Batie∣patan,</HI>
where meeting with good store of Pepper,
our Vessel got her full Cargo.</P>
<P><HI>Batiepatan</HI> is a Town belonging to the Kingdom
of <HI>Cananor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Batie∣patan.</HI></NOTE> on the East of <HI>Malabar,</HI> situate under

not above a League distant from the Sea-side,
and is inhabited for the most part by rich Mer∣chants,
who are all <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>At a small distance from the Town, is the King's
Palace, surrounded by a great many <HI>Pagan</HI> Tem∣ples,
very magnificently built; and it was near
this place the Governour had assigned a settlement
to the <HI>French</HI> at that time, till they could pitch up∣on
another place, which might be more suitable to
their purpose.</P>
<P>The Ship called the <HI>Strong,</HI> arriving some days
after ours, they were both dispatch'd with all pos∣sible

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>WHen we speak of the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> we
commonly comprehend that large tract of
Ground, which extends from <HI>Suratte,</HI> as far as to
Cape <HI>Comorin;</HI> but to distinguish it the more ex∣actly
from other adjacent Countries, belonging to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> we will fix its beginning at the Mount
of <HI>Eli,</HI> situate under the twelfth degree of <HI>North</HI> La∣titude,
this being the place, where the People begin
to assume the Name of <HI>Malabars</HI> or <HI>Malavars.</HI></P>
<P>Its extent all along the Coast is of above two hun∣dred
Leagues in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extent of <HI>Mala∣bar.</HI></NOTE> being divided into several
Kingdoms, the Princes whereof are generally <HI>Pa∣gans.</HI>
Most of these petty Kings possess but small
Territories; nevertheless they are independent, and
not tributary to any other Prince.</P>
<P>The most powerful of them all is the King of
<HI>Cananor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">King of <HI>Cananor.</HI></NOTE> being dreaded and respected by all the rest;
he is called <HI>Cotitri,</HI> a name belonging to all the

<P>The King of <HI>Samorin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">King of <HI>Samorin.</HI></NOTE> though his Territories are
much larger than the formers, yet is look'd upon as
much inferiour in Strength.</P>
<P>Their manner of Living, Religion and Customs
are the same, so that what we relate of the Kingdom
of <HI>Cananor,</HI> may be applied to all the rest of the
<HI>Malabars.</HI></P>
<P>The Air is very good all over the Country,
which is one of the most fertile in all <HI>Asia;</HI> they
reap Rice twice a Year, and have good store of most
excellent Fruits, but quite different from those in
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="47"/>
Though it be evident that the <HI>Cocoe</HI> is none of the
most delicious Fruit of the <HI>Indies,</HI> nevertheless its
usefulness being so universal, it deserves to be
mentioned here, and we will insert a particu∣lar
Description of the Tree that bears so useful a
Fruit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Malabars</HI> call it <HI>Tencar,</HI> which signifies as
much as straight, as having no Branches, though the
Tree it self be sometimes thirty or forty foot high,
seldom exceeding three foot in compass. The
Wood is spongy, and consequently useless for Build∣ing,
unless it be when it grows very old, when it
becomes much more solid.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocoe-Tree described.</NOTE> The roots of it are ma∣ny,
spreading almost above ground, notwithstand∣ing
which, the Tree out-braves the utmost fury of
Winds, it being very rare to see them t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn up even
by the most violent Hurricanes. Towards the top
there sprouts out about a douzen leaves of ten foot
long each, and one and an half broad, being divi∣ded
in the middle like those of the Date-tree; when
they are dryed, they serve instead of Tiles to cover
Houses withall; out of their finest Threads they
make very fine Mats. Tents and Huts of the cour∣ser
Branches. The middle part of the leaf serves for
Fuel. Their number is always the same; for so soon
as one falls, another grows in its stead. On the ve∣ry
top of the Tree there sprouts out a very large
Bud, not unlike a Cabbage or Cawly-flower, but
much larger and finer than ours, enough to serve
ten People for a Meal; but, because the Tree dies
soon after the Fruit is gathered, they commonly cut
down the Tree near the Root, when they intend
to make use of it. Betwixt the top and the leaves
come forth abundance of young Sprigs, about the
thickness of a Man's Arm; these they cut, from
whence destills a Liquor of a white Colour,
and a sweet and delicious taste, which the <HI>Tieves</HI>
(such among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> as apply themselves to
Husbandry) come to gather Mornings and Even∣ings
in certain Vessels fastned to the end of the Sprigs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palm-Tree Wine.</NOTE>
from whence flows the said Liquor.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="47"/>
This is the Wine of the Country, called by them
<HI>Houry,</HI> or <HI>Tary;</HI> it is so strong as to inebriate a Man
like our Wines;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vinegar and Bran∣dy.</NOTE> in few hours it contracts a
sharpness, and in one Day and Night turns quite
Sowre, when it is used instead of Vinegar, they
having no other throughout the <HI>Indies.</HI> They also
make of it a kind of <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> or Brandy, which
by repeated Destillations becomes excessive strong.</P>
<P>If you put this Liquor as soon as it is drawn from
the Quick-tree, into a Basin with a small quantity
of Lime, it becomes as sweet as Honey, which
they make use of for Preserves, and if it be boiled
for some time, it becomes Sugar, not quite so good
as that which is drawn from Canes, but which is
nevertherless much used among the common Peo∣ple
of <HI>Malabar;</HI> the Natives call it <HI>Jagara,</HI> and the
<HI>Portuguese Jagre.</HI> As long as the <HI>Tary</HI> destills out of
the Sprigs, the Tree bears no Fruit, but if you let
them grow, there come forth great Bunches, which
produce the <HI>Cocoes</HI> hanging in Clusters, to the num∣ber
of ten or twelve.</P>
<P>Their skin is very tender at first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocoes.</NOTE> and easie to be
slit, from whence flows a very clear and fresh Li∣quor,
of a very agreeable taste; some of them will
afford not much above a pint of Liquor, whereas o∣thers
give near a Gallon.</P>
<P>This Liquor is by degrees converted into a solid
substance, which is very soft and white, and then
the <HI>Malabars</HI> call the <HI>Cocoes Elenir,</HI> and the <HI>Portu∣guese
Lagne.</HI> Afterwards the moisture being all con∣sumed,
the Fruit becomes hard, and its taste is not
unlike our Hasle Nuts. They are so well known
in those parts, that it would be superfluous to give
a particular account here, to what use they are put
in <HI>Europe,</HI> since they are brought thither from all
parts in so great quantities, that they are no more
look'd upon now a days as a rarity, but are esteem∣ed
meerly for their Natural and intrinsick good∣ness.</P>
<P>The Tree brings forth Fruit three times a year;
some are as big as a Man's Head, and because they
<PB N="64" REF="48"/>
are beaten down by the least Wind, it is dangerous
to walk under these Trees when the Fruit is come to
perfection.</P>
<P>They make out of the outward Husk, when dri∣ed,
a kind of Hemp, the threads of which serve to
make strong Cordage and Cables, for the biggest
Ships; and as there is a prodigious quantity of this
Fruit all over the <HI>Indies,</HI> so besides what is consum'd
by the Natives, and what is exported by Foreigners;
they burn abundance of it, to make Charcoals for
the use of the Goldsmiths and others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Cooks season their Meats with a cer∣tain
Liquor which they get out of the <HI>Cocoes</HI> by scra∣ping
it, and the poorer sort extract an Oyl of it,
which they both Eat and Burn in their Lamps.
They fatten their Poultry and Hogs with the rem∣nants
out of which the Oil has been pressed, and so
the poor sometimes make Bread of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian <HI>Paper.</HI></NOTE> The Pith
of the Tree is White, and as fine as any Paper, for
which use it is much sought after by persons of Qua∣lity.</P>
<P>Considering the extraordinary benefit reap'd from
this Tree, he may well be look'd upon as one of the
most precious in the Universe, though he be none
of the rarest. What has been related by some, to wit,
That they make Ships that cross the Seas without
any thing but what the <HI>Cocoe</HI> affords, though it seems
to savour of a Romance, is nevertheless thus far true;
that they may equip a good large Barge with Masts,
Sails, (which are made out of the leaves) and Cor∣dage
loaden with the products of the Tree and Fruits
of the <HI>Cocoes.</HI></P>
<P>There are besides this two other kinds of Palm-trees;
the first bears that sort of Dates, which ne∣ver
come to maturity in the <HI>Indies;</HI> the Tree is not
above eight or ten foot high, without Branches, and
bears its leaves on the top, much like the <HI>Cocoe-tree,</HI>
but they are not near so large. They bore a hole
in the Arm of the Tree, from whence by the help
of a Pipe, they draw a certain Liquor not unlike
the <HI>Tary,</HI> we have mention'd before. The Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="65" REF="48"/>
call it <HI>Nary,</HI> and it serves them to make Vine∣gar
of and <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> but no Sugar.</P>
<P>The other kind is the Wild Palm-tree;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other sorts of <HI>Palm-Trees.</HI></NOTE> its fruit is
good for nothing; they call it <HI>Traf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uli;</HI> but the Li∣quor
which they draw out of it, is not inferiour to that
of the <HI>Cocoes.</HI> The Tree exceeds the other in Big∣ness,
and its leaves are so large, as that four of them
serve for a Coverlid to a Bed of five foot long; they
make of them Umbrella's, or as the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call
them, <HI>Somb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arios,</HI> which are very useful both against
the Rain, and heat of the Sun.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the two Fruits called the Jacque and the
Mangos.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Jacque</HI> is of so prodigious a bigness, that
one of them is sometimes a good Burthen for
a Man; though the Tree seldom exceeds our Ap∣ple-trees
in Bulk. Its leaves are not unlike to the
Laurel, but something larger: The Fruit is fastned
to the Stemm, because the Branches are not strong
enough to bear it; it buds out at first sight most
like Moss, is of a green Colour, till it comes to ma∣turity;
its Skin is most like that of the <HI>Anana's;</HI> it
is pretty thick but soft, and may easily be cut with
a Knife, provided you dip it first in Oil, or any o∣ther
oleaginous substance, which prevents the
Gumm from sticking to it. The Fruit is divided
within by many partitions, containing a certain sub∣stance
not unlike our Plums, and of the bigness of an
ordinary Pullet's Egg; there are sometimes two
hundred of them, the Pulp that surrounds it, is a∣bout
an inch thick, of a Yellow Colour, and tastes
almost like our best Melons. In the very midst of
<PB N="66" REF="49"/>
the Fruit, there appears something not unlike our
Chesnuts, which being the Seed of the <HI>Jacque,</HI> is
never eaten; and the whole substance it self is ve∣ry
unwholesome, unless you drink a good quan∣tity
of Water after it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mangos</HI> is a much more excellent Fruit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Man∣gos.</NOTE>
resembling our Nectarins; they are of different co∣lours,
to wit, Red, White and Green, when they
are Ripe. Some are of the bigness of an Egg,
some bigger than our largest Pears; their Skin is
pretty hard, but the Pulp soft; they are to be met
with all over the <HI>Indies,</HI> but are much better in some
places than in others, those on the coast of <HI>Malabar</HI>
are of the worst sort. About <HI>Suratte</HI> and <HI>Daman,</HI>
they are indifferently good, but the best are in the
Isle of <HI>Goa;</HI> they are not ripe till <HI>September,</HI> they are
most excellent preserved whilst they are Green; they
also pickle them with Vinegar; the Tree is of the
bigness of our Wallnut-tree, and the Wood very
fit for all sorts of Joyners Work.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Pepper, Cardamon, Cinnamon and Bethel.</HEAD>
<P>THE Shrub which bears the Pepper is always
planted near other great Trees, which keep
it upright; its leaves are very like the Ivy, whose
smell is as biting to the Nostrils, as the Fruit is to
the Tongue. The Pepper sprouts forth in small
Bunches; its colour is Green at first, but turns Red
when it comes to Maturity, and after it has been
dry'd in the Sun, appears such as we see it in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
There is but one kind, the difference betwixt
the Black and White (according to the opinion of
the vulgar) being nothing else, but that the first re∣tains
<PB N="67" REF="49"/>
its native husk, whereas the other is peeled,
which they do by thrashing it with small sticks be∣fore
it be quite dry, or after it is dryed, by soaking
it for a little while in Water, and then rub off the
outward peel; by which means, every body that has
black Pepper, may soon convert it into White, if
he will take the trouble to do it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> preserve it with Sugar whilst it is
Green,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper pre∣served.</NOTE> and make also a Pickle of it with Vinegar,
which they call <HI>Achar,</HI> a name they give to all their
Pickles made with Vinegar.</P>
<P>The Pepper grows in a great many places, but
no where in such abundance as from <HI>Rajapour,</HI> as far
as to Cape <HI>Comorin;</HI> the largest sort comes from
<HI>Visapour</HI> and <HI>Canara;</HI> the Pepper that grows on the
Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> that is from Mount <HI>Eli,</HI> to
the most Southern part of the Coast, is not so big as
the other, but it multiplies faster, and most Nati∣ons
furnish themselves with Pepper in those parts,
to transport it into their respective Countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cardamom</HI> grows in the Kingdom of <HI>Cananor</HI>
near a certain Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardamom.</NOTE> about six or seven Leagues
distant from the Sea-side, this being the only place
in the whole World where it grows; this spot of
Ground produces a vast yearly revenue to the own∣ers.
They need neither Sow nor Plant it, all the
pains they are obliged to take, is, to burn the Herbs
after the rainy Season is over, which grow there a∣bouts;
the Ashes of which produce the Carda∣mom.</P>
<P>It is transported from hence all over the <HI>Indies</HI> in∣to
<HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> the Inhabitants of these Coun∣tries
never relishing their Rice well, unless it be sea∣son'd
with the Cardamom, so that the greatest part
of it is consumed in the <HI>East,</HI> the rest is bought up
by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who chiefly make use of it in Phy∣sick:
It is three times as dear as the Pepper.</P>
<P>There also grows Cinnamon on this Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cinnamon.</NOTE> but
does not come in goodness near to that which the
Isle of <HI>Ceylon</HI> produces, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> former∣ly
took from the <HI>Pertuguese.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="50"/>
The Leaves which by the <HI>Malabars</HI> are called
<HI>Betle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Leaves of <HI>Bethel.</HI></NOTE> by the <HI>Portuguese Bethel,</HI> and the other <HI>In∣dians
Panthle,</HI> ought not to be pass'd by in si∣lence
in this place. They grow on Shrubs like
the Pepper, and are not unlike the Ivy Leaves as
well as the others; but they have a pleasant aro∣matick
flavour, their natural Colour being Green.
They whiten them without the least prejudice to
their native vertue, by laying them in Wooden
Casks, made out of the <HI>Bananas</HI> Tree, and by
sprinkling them with Water once a day. They
never chew them without the <HI>Areque;</HI> this is a
small Fruit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Areque.</NOTE> very like our Green Wall-Nuts, which
they lay in water to make the Peel rotten. The
<HI>Areque</HI> has a very offensive smell, whilst it is fresh,
but being dried, retains nothing of its ill scent; it
is a little biting upon the Tongue, and promotes
Spitting.</P>
<P>The Chaw made of the <HI>Bethel</HI> they prepare
thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian <HI>Chaw.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>They take about the quantity of a Pea of Chalk
or Lime, which they put among 3 or 4 Leaves
of <HI>Bethel,</HI> and mix with it a fourth part of an <HI>Are∣que</HI>
Nut, which they will use together, and chaw
it at pleasure. There are some of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
who add to it a few Grains of Cardamom, a small
quantity of Cloves and Cinnamon, which gives it
a very agreeable taste. The Tree which produces
the <HI>Areque,</HI> grows straight, without Branches, on∣ly
a few Leaves on the Top; the Wood is tolera∣bly
good for Building, but most us'd for Masts of
Barges, they being not strong enough for large Ves∣sels.</P>
<P>The Chaw being thus prepared, fortifies the Sto∣mach,
promotes Digestion, and leaves a good smell
behind it, moistens the Mouth, and dyes the Spit∣tle
and Lips red; from whence without Questi∣on
is arisen this vulgar error, that some have affir∣med
it makes the Gums Bleed.</P>
<P>It is a great Specifick against the Stone, as I my
self have Experienc'd several times, when I pre∣scribed
<PB N="69" REF="50"/>
it to some of my Acquaintance in that
case. And what may serve as a confirmation of
what I have asserted as to this particular, it is to be
observed that in those places, where it is frequent∣ly
used; I never met with any body that was
Afflicted with this Distemper.</P>
<P>Before a Man is used to this Chaw, it will cause
a Dizziness, occasioned by the <HI>Areque,</HI> but this
may in a great measure be prevented, by well
cleansing the said Fruit, from a certain white sub∣stance,
which is within it. The <HI>Europeans</HI> who
have for some time lived in the <HI>Indies,</HI> are gene∣rally
as fond of this Chaw as the <HI>Indians</HI> them∣selves;
and the Leaves of the <HI>Bethel</HI> as common as
they are, are nevertheless in great esteem, as well
among Persons of the first Rank, as the meanest
Peasants. If you pay a Visit to any body here,
the first thing which is presented is a Roll of this
Chaw; if you should let a Friend go out of your
House without it, he would take it as a gross Af∣front,
and so it would be look'd upon on the other
hand, if he should refuse to accept it; neverthe∣less,
no body is oblig'd to take it upon the spot,
the <HI>Asiaticks</HI> in general being very jealous of one
another, and extreamly fearful of Poyson.</P>
<P>There is a certain Tree all over the <HI>Indies,</HI> but
more especially in <HI>Malabar,</HI> which grows to a con∣siderable
height, its Leaves are like those of the
Laurel, or at least very little different; it bears a
whitish Flower of a very good scent; out of the
Stem distills a Gum, which is very useful for Ships;
but what is particularly remarkable in this Tree,
is, that its Branches after they are grown up to
some height, turn downwards again to the Ground,
where as soon as they touch they take root, and
in process of time, grow equal in bulk to the first
Stem. If the Inhabitants did not prevent the spread∣ing
of this Tree by continually cutting down its Bran∣ches,
one Tree would in time be sufficient to spread
it self all over the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="51"/>
<HI>Malabar</HI> abounds in almost all the same sorts of
Pulse we have in these parts, besides which, it has
some peculiar to it self; among these are certain
Beans of four Fingers long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Large Peans.</NOTE> the Cod containing in
length a foot and half. They come very quickly
to maturity, are of no good taste, and only used by
the poorer sort. They are never seen in Gardens,
unless it be to cover and shadow their Arbours or
Summer-Houses.</P>
<P>Besides which, they have on both sides of their
Walks, Hedge-rows of a certain Shrub, which spreads
and twists it self in a little time to admiration;
it is very full of Leaves, resembling those of the
Garden Burnet, and bears a great quantity of
Flowers, of a right Red Colour, not unlike the Jessa∣mine
Flowers, but having not the least scent, serve
only to please the Eye. They begin to blow at
Sun-rising, and fall off at Sun-set. Notwithstan∣ding
which, these Hedges never want Flowers the
whole Year round, without the trouble of Sowing
or Planting them after the first time, because they
scatter certain Grains upon the Ground, which im∣mediately
taking root, furnish the Hedge with an
immediate supply of new Shrubs and Flowers.
The <HI>Malabars</HI> are not such great admirers of Flowers
as the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are subject to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI>
and tho' their Country is not destitute of these
materials, from whence they draw their essences
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> yet their Women seldom make use
of any thing else than the Oil drawn from the Co∣coes,
they not being inclined so much to the va∣nity
of perfumes, as the rest of the <HI>Indian</HI> Wo∣men.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Elephant and some other Animals of
Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>THE Birds which are found in <HI>Malabar,</HI> are the
same which you meet with in other parts of
the <HI>Indies.</HI> Perroquets or Perrots, of all sizes and
Colours, are here in great numbers; they catch
them with Nets, sometimes 200 at a time, but
the <HI>Indians</HI> never take any pains to teach them to
Speak, as we do in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They do abound in all sorts of Wild fowl, which
they take with a great deal of ease, unless it be
the Wild-Peacock, which is very difficult to be
catch'd, which makes him to be look'd upon as a
rarity, not only for the Tail, but also for his Fea∣thers,
which are in great esteem among all the <HI>A∣siaticks;</HI>
they make Umbrella's, Shrines, and Fans
of them, for persons of Quality, which they adorn
with Gold, and Precious Stones. They have also
good store of Tame-Fowl.</P>
<P>The Elephant ought to hold the first rank among
the Beasts which are to be found on the Coast of
<HI>Malabar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephant.</NOTE> tho' it be brought thither from other
parts of the <HI>Indies.</HI> It is the biggest among all the
Terrestrial Creatures, the Head is not proportiona∣ble
in bigness to the Body, its Ears are in shape
not unlike to the Wings of a Flitter-Mouse; Its
Legs round and thick, and of an equal bigness,
but is not destitute of Joynts. He makes use of his
Snout to take hold of any thing that is offered him,
this he can draw in or extend at pleasure, and
where-ever he lays hold with it, no Man alive is
<PB N="72" REF="52"/>
able to wrest it from him against his will; he will
handle a Cimetar with the same dexterity as if he
had the use of Hands; this Trunk or Snout, is
hollow within, so that when the Elephant drinks,
he draws the Water through it into his Mouth.
I have seen them returning from the River side,
when some of them had kept in their Trunks near
a Pailful of Water, which they would spout into
the Faces of such persons as they bore a grudge
to; no Creature alive is more intelligible, nor has
a greater memory than the Elephant, of which
I have been sufficiently convinced, upon several
occasions.</P>
<P>Each City in the <HI>Indies</HI> entertains a certain num∣ber
of young Fellows, who's Business it is to sweep
their Houses and Streets. A Boy of about 12 or
13 Years of Age, who belonged to those employ∣ed
in this drudgery in the City of <HI>Suratte,</HI> having
swept together some excrements, and seeing an
Elephant coming that way, took up as many of
them as he could hold in both his Hands, and
threw it directly at the Elephant's Eyes, who went
on his way without showing the least sign of re∣sentment.
But several days after, meeting the
same Boy in a narrow Street, he took hold of him
with his Trunk round the Waste, and so tost him
above 100 times at a great heighth in the Air, to
the no small surprize of all that beheld it; I
did not imagine otherwise, but that it would have
cost the Boy his Life; but after some time we
were agreeably surprized to find that the Elephant
only intended to put him into a fright, in retal∣liation
for the Affront he had received from him
some days before; for, after he had thus sported
with him, as long as he thought convenient, he laid
him gently again in the same place where he had
taken him up, and without more ado went his
way.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vice-Roy, had an Elephant
of an extraordinary Bigness, which he being resol∣ved
to Present to the King, he ordered he should
<PB N="73" REF="52"/>
be Embark'd in the first Vessel, that was to go for
<HI>Lisbon.</HI> He that had the oversight of the Elephant,
being unwilling to leave his Native Country, used
in the mean while to tell the Elephant in the same
terms as one should speak to a Man, That they
were going to Transport him into a Country where
he must expect to undergo all the Slavery and
Hardship that could be imagined; which had
made such a lively impression upon the Elephant,
that all the Art of Mankind, could not get him
into the Vessel, which was to Transport him, se∣veral
having lost their Lives by his fury, who at∣tempted
to force him into the Ship; the Vice-Roy
being advertized of what had passed, and not
doubting but that this Trick had been put upon
him by the Manager of the Elephant, had him
brought into his presence, and threatned him with
Death, if within a limited time, he did not take
care to have the Elephant conveyed into the Ship;
the Fellow dreading the Vice-Roy's Anger, was
obliged to change his Lesson, and to tell the Ele∣phant,
that he was to be Presented to a great Prince,
where he was to lead a very easie Life, which had
such an influence upon this Creature, that they
afterwards Embark'd him without the least resi∣stance.</P>
<P>There is scarce any Person of Quality in the <HI>In∣dies</HI>
but what has some Elephants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usefulness of the <HI>Ele∣phant.</HI></NOTE> their Kings
make use of them when they are engaged in War,
they employ them in carrying their Canon and
Soldiers; I have seen some of the <HI>Indian</HI> Gover∣nors
going into the Country for their divertise∣ment,
upon the Back of an Elephant, where they
had fixed very large and Magnificent Tents, divided
into 2 or 3 Apartments, to wit, one for the Men,
and the other for the Women, and the third for
a Table provided with variety of eatables.</P>
<P>They adorn them with fine Coverings, not un∣like
in fashion to our Horse-Cloaths; I have seen
some of them which took up no less than 100
Yards of Cloath apiece; and yet these were made
<PB N="74" REF="53"/>
for Elephants that are not of the biggest size; for, I
can affirm it for Truth, because I have been an eye
witness of it, that there are some much larger;
which may be easily discovered by their Teeth.
For those of the Elephants on the Coast of <HI>Mala∣bar,</HI>
seldom exceed 3 or 4 Foot in length, and
may be carried without much difficulty by one
Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elephant</HI>'s Teeth.</NOTE> whereas the Elephant's Teeth of <HI>Bombaza</HI>
and <HI>Mosambigue,</HI> two places in <HI>Africa,</HI> are general∣ly
above 10 Foot long, and of such a bigness,
that two Men can scarce lift them from the
Ground.</P>
<P>Abundance of these Teeth are brought to the
<HI>Indies,</HI> each Elephant has no more than two of
them, which furnish us as well as other parts of
the World with what we call Ivory.</P>
<P>After I had by my own Experience been suffici∣ently
instructed concerning the nature of the E∣lephant,
I could not but admire with what Im∣pudence
some have forged their Fables concern∣ing
the Elephant's having no joynts in their Legs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fables con∣cerning the <HI>Elephant.</HI></NOTE>
how they could never lie down, and if by mischance
he happened to fall, he could never rise again;
that when he takes his natural rest, he leans against
a Tree, and that the only way to catch him is to
saw the Trunk of the Tree, which he is observed
to make his Sleeping-place, that so he may fall
down together with the Tree; but these are meer
Inventions of those who Travel no farther than
within the compass of their own homes; for, who∣ever
has been in any part of <HI>Asia</HI> must needs be con∣vinced
to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Elephant lies down without any great trou∣ble,
he bends his Knee as often as his Master mounts
on the Back of him, and Sleeps in the same posture
as a Horse.</P>
<P>They catch him in the following manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How he is catch'd.</NOTE> when
they know the way he commonly takes, they dig
a hole or ditch, which they cover slightly with
Branches, with some Earth a-top of it, where the
Elephant is drawn into the Snare; for the bulk of
<PB N="75" REF="53"/>
his Body being such, as to prevent his turning and
lifting himself as in so narrow a Compass, he is
catch'd by those who have laid the Trap.</P>
<P>The <HI>African Negroes</HI> eat his Flesh, and I have
heard it affirm'd for Truth, that his Snout is very
delicious meat; but generally they are kill'd for
their Teeth sake, tho' they also sometimes fall
out of themselves.</P>
<P>The Hyde rightly dress'd, is of such thickness,
that they are proof against a Musket-ball; abun∣dance
of the young ones are brought up and Tamed,
and are generally catch'd as they run astray, after
they have lost the old ones by one accident or ano∣ther.
Notwithstanding the prodigious Bulk of this
Animal, it Swims extreamly well, and goes a great
pace; besides which, it is as Courageous as it is
Strong, and does great Service to the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings
in their Wars.</P>
<P>During my abode in the <HI>Indies,</HI> there was a cer∣tain
Governor, who being willing to give an ex∣traordinary
piece of diversion to some persons of
Quality, caused an Elephant and Tyger to be
brought into a kind of an Amphitheatre, erected
for that purpose, to try their Strength and Activi∣ty,
against one another; the Tyger is a very nim∣ble
Creature, but much inferiour in Bulk to the
Elephant; his chief Strength lies in his Claws and
Teeth, of which he gave a sufficient proof to his
Enemy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Combat be∣twixt an Elephant and Tyger.</NOTE> for sometimes he was upon his Back,
sometimes under his Belly, where he left very
Bloody marks of his furious Attempts; the Ele∣phant
on the other hand, used his Snout with a
great deal of dexterity, tossing the Tyger at a
great distance, and endeavouring to trample him
under his Feet, whilst the other tore his Skin in
every part where he could lay hold with his Claws
or Teeth. Their fury did not end till with the loss
of their Lives, they continuing the Combat till
the Elephant pressing with utmost violence upon
the Tyger, and the other fastning with his Claws
to his Belly, they disputed the Victory, till both re∣main'd
dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="54"/>
Those who manage the Elephant are by the <HI>Ma∣labars</HI>
called <HI>Cornac;</HI> they sit upon the neck of the
Beast, where they hold themselves without the help
of a Bridle; they have always two sticks with Iron
Hooks at the end, one bigger than the other; the
small one they use instead of a Spur, wherewith
they strike the Elephant over the Head, to make
him go as they please; so that you seldom see any
of these Beasts without a Wound on their Heads.
The other they make use of to keep the Elephant
back, and to make him stop when he is furious, and
when the little one is insufficient.</P>
<P>I have seen some Elephants belonging to some of
the <HI>Malabar</HI> Princes get loose, who destroy every
thing they meet in their way, tear up Trees, and
pull down the Peasants Cottages (which indeed
in those parts, must not be imagined to be so well
built as ours) forcing the inhabitants to leave their
dwelling places, and to seek for shelter in the ad∣jacent
Towns; thus have I several times seen a con∣siderable
number of Country People come to our
Habitations, who dreading the fury of these Ani∣mals,
had been forced to abandon their Houses.</P>
<P>The Kings of the <HI>Malabars</HI> frequently employ
their Elephants to chastise their rebellious Subjects,
by letting them loose into their Grounds, where
they destroy not only all the Fruits of the Earth,
but also the biggest Trees, there being not wanting
instances, that a large Elephant has torn up a Co∣coe-tree.</P>
<P>The Merchants in the <HI>Indies</HI> hire Elephants to
draw their Vessels and Barges a shoar, when they
are to be refitted; and, as the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes keep
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to shew their magnificence, so the <HI>Bramans</HI>
make use of them on their great Feasts, when they
carry the Statues of their Idol, there being certain
Temples, which entertain a set number of Ele∣phants
meerly for that purpose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tiger, and some other Creatures of
Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>Malabar</HI> the Tigers are found in greater num∣bers
than in any other part of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Of
these Creatures so famous for their Cruelties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of Tigers.</NOTE> there
are three sorts, distinguished only by their different
sizes.</P>
<P>The first is not much bigger than a large Cat; of
this kind I saw one, which was kept in the House
of the <HI>French East-India</HI> Company, in the Kingdom
of <HI>Cananor,</HI> which was brought thither from <HI>Mir∣scou,</HI>
and when he cry'd, made as much noise as
an Ox. They fed him commonly with Flesh, and
if they threw him some Rice, he was so cunning as
to draw back as far as the Chain would give him
leave when he would watch his opportunity to
snatch up the Pullets and Ducks that came to feed
upon the Rice; at last our Tiger found means one
time to break his Chain, and to give us the Slip. I
was one of the foremost who pursued him, but got
nothing for my pains, but a Wound, which he
gave me with his Claws in the right hand, and so
he got into the open Fields, where we were not a∣ble
to overtake him.</P>
<P>The second kind is as big as a good Mutton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second kind.</NOTE> or
a slender Calf; these as they are most common, so
they do the most mischief among the Cattle, and
are therefore most closely pursued. The Princes in
those parts to encourage their Subjects to destroy
these mischievous Creatures, give always a
Bracelet of Gold to any Man that kills one of those
Tigers, which present is look'd upon in the <HI>Indies</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="55"/>
as a Badge of Honour, not unlike to our Knight∣hood,
no body being allowed to wear a Golden
Bracelet here, without being authorized to it by
the King of that Country, whose subject he is.</P>
<P>I was acquainted with an <HI>Indian,</HI> who alone kill'd
one of these Tigers, without receiving the least
hurt, and had no other Arms but his Shield and Ci∣metar.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> residing at <HI>Batiepatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tiger kills three <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> had not the
same good fortune with a Tiger which used to
come now and then into their Grounds in the Night-time.
For having made great Havock all round
their Habitations for a considerable time, they took
a resolution to watch his coming; for which pur∣pose,
having provided themselves with Fire-arms,
they met and wounded him with a Ball out of a Fu∣zee,
but the Wound not proving mortal, the Ti∣ger
fell in among them with such a Fury, that he
killed two or three of them, and got away.</P>
<P>I was once my self in no small danger of having
been surprized by this cruel Animal, not long af∣ter
my arrival in <HI>Malabar.</HI> The excessive heat of
the Season, made me very desirous to lay abroad
very often, having three great Dogs near me for my
Guard. One Night I was all on a sudden awaken∣ed
by their Cries, and seeing them fly away as
fast as they could from a certain Animal, that pur∣sued
them with great Eagerness; I called for help,
and some of our Domesticks being come with ligh∣ted
Torches to my assistance, we found two of the
Dogs, which were returned to the place where they
had left me, but the third was missing; we look'd
all about as far as we could, but in vain, not being
able to learn any tidings of our Dog till the next
day, when we found his Bones scattered at two
hundred paces from the House. This adventure
served me for a warning, not to expose my self thus
for the future, by lying abroad all Night.</P>
<P>The Tiger of the third kind is near as big as a
Horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third kind of Ti∣gers.</NOTE> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call it the <HI>Royal Tiger.</HI> I never
saw any of them alive, but have seen several of their
<PB N="79" REF="55"/>
Skins which were big enough to cover a Bed of six
foot long; they are only found towards the <HI>North</HI> of
<HI>Goa,</HI> where it is therefore extreamly dangerous Tra∣veling
alone, or without being well provided with
good Fire-arms.</P>
<P>I was acquainted with a certain Gentleman, a
<HI>Portuguese</HI> by Birth, whose name was <HI>John de Liquiera,</HI>
living at <HI>Daman:</HI> He had a Country House near
the said City, whither two Friends of his being come
to give him a Visit, he would needs divert them
with Hunting the wild Boar; going out early in the
Morning, in a Calash, each with a Fuzee, they
met with one of these <HI>Royal Tigers,</HI> and seeing him
at some distance, they agreed it would be best to
let fly at him, which <HI>John de Liquiera</HI> did with so much
dexterity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remark∣able Histo∣ry of a Ti∣ger.</NOTE> that he dropt down immediately, with∣out
the least appearance of life; it is easie to be
conceived that they were extreamly rejoyced at
their Victory, which they had gained at so cheap
a rate, and being in a solitary place, not far from
<HI>Liquiera</HI>'s Country House, they resolved to leave
their Prey, (which is esteemed a great rarity by rea∣son
of the Beauty of the Skin) till they had broke
their Fast. But afterwards returning to the place,
they were not a little surprized when they found
neither the Tiger nor any tract of Blood; so that
<HI>John de Liquiera</HI> against the advice of his Friends,
getting out of the Calash into the adjacent Bushes,
found the Tiger there wallowing in his own Blood;
but the enraged Animal, as if it had been sensible
of the approach of him who had given him his mor∣tal
Wound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> in danger of being torn in pieces by a Tiger.</NOTE> flew upon him with so much fury,
that he threw him immediately upon the Ground,
and fell a tearing his Flesh, where ever he fixed his
Claws. His other two Friends, who had follow'd
him at some distance, were at the greatest incerti∣tude
what to do in this extremity, they wanting
Arms to come to a close Engagement with the Tiger▪
to rescue their Friend, and they durst not make use of
their Fire-arms for fear of killing him instead of the
cruel Beast; their only hopes was, that the Tiger
<PB N="80" REF="56"/>
would be soon disabled by the loss of Blood, which
flowed like a stream out of his Wound; but per∣ceiving
his fierceness rather increase than abate, they
resolved to venture all, and advancing as near as
they thought convenient, one of them shot the Ti∣ger
with his Fuzee, so as that he drop'd down
dead upon the spot. They ran immediately to the
assistance of their Friend, whom they found with
his Face downwards, and his back and sides torn in
so miserable a manner, that it was the most tragical
Spectacle that ever was seen; they made a shift to
carry him to his own House, where having laid him
upon a Bed, they found his Wounds in so desperate
a condition, that they expected every moment,
when he would breath his last.</P>
<P>Whilst they were in this confusion, no body
knowing what to resolve on, one of the <HI>Pagan</HI>
Slaves belonging to this Gentleman, having been
informed of his Master's misfortune, came into the
Room, and told them, That if they would leave
him to his care, he would certainly save him. There
was scarce any body who made any great reflections
upon what the Slave had assured them; but looking
upon their Friends case as desperate, they accepted
his offer: And the Slave went immediately to apply
his remedy, which was made of the juice of certain
Herbs mix'd with Milk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marvellous cure.</NOTE> by the help of which he
in time restored his Master to perfect Health, or∣dering
him all the while, nothing else for his Dyet,
but Bread and Milk; a cure so miraculous, as scarce
will find credit in these parts.</P>
<P>This same Gentleman, who has given me the
Relation with his own Mouth, which he him∣self
is scarce able to make without horror, preserves
to this day the Skin of this Tiger, which being a∣bove
six foot long, serves him as a lasting remem∣brance
of this dreadful Adventure.</P>
<P>To avoid the Tigers in the Night-time, nothing
is more proper than to keep a Candle or some other
Light near one, which they avoid to come near▪
But in the Day-time you must be provided with
<PB N="81" REF="56"/>
good Fire-arms, or a Bow, to let fly at him, be∣fore
he comes too near you; but you must be sure of
your hits, for if you do not wound him mortally,
he becomes more furious, and you will be in great
danger of being torn in pieces; wherefore if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou be
not an excellent Marks-man, the best way is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dis∣charge
your Gun into the Air, the noise of which
will frighten, and make him turn his back to you.</P>
<P>The Skins of these three several sorts of Tigers,
are very near the same, as to their colour, their
Beauty makes them much esteemed, they use them
in the <HI>Indies</HI> to cover their Beds and Palanquins,
and in <HI>Europe</HI> are look'd upon as a great variety.
Formerly our great Warriors used to adorn their
Horses with them, it being one of the finest Furs in
the World.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some other Animals; of the Jaccal; of the
Buffler; of the Civet Cat and Ape.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Jaccal</HI> or <HI>Adive</HI> is about the bigness of
a middle siezed Dog, resembling a Fox to∣wards
the Tail, but has a Face not unlike a Wolf;
they are sometimes tamed and entertained at home
among other Domestick Animals. When they are
Wild, they hide themselves under Ground in the
Day-time, and never come abroad but in the Night,
when they look out for Pray. They commonly
appear in Troops, fall upon Children to devour
them, and sometimes frighten Travellers that are
unprovided with Arms; they howl in a most dole∣ful
manner, not unlike the cries of a great many
Children of different Ages mix'd together. They
<PB N="82" REF="57"/>
are at perpetual War with the Dogs, who are al∣ways
at their heels, if they appear near their dwell∣ing
places. They are generally the forerunner of
the Tigers, who never devour them, but make use
of them as their Setting Dogs, to draw the House
Dogs into the Snare; wherefore the <HI>Indian</HI> Peasants,
who are not ignorant of the cunning of the Tiger,
when they hear the <HI>Adive</HI> cry, take care to keep
their Dogs close at home, for fear of the Tiger. It
is an insignificant Creature, and quite useless, and
therefore deserves not our further Description.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buffler</HI> is larger than an ordinary Ox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Buffler.</NOTE> but
much of the same shape, only that his Head is some∣thing
longer and flatter; his Eyes, which are al∣most
White, much larger; his Horns, also flat and
sometimes ten foot long; his Legs very short and
thick. It is an ugly Creature to look on, having
scarce any Hair. He goes very slow, but will carry
a great Burthen. You may see them feed in herds
like the Cows, and they give good store of Milk,
whereof they make Butter and Cheese. Their flesh
is tolerably good, but not so delicious as Beef; they
swim excellently well, and pass without much dif∣ficulty
the largest Rivers; the wild <HI>Bufflers</HI> are dan∣gerous
Creatures, they often tear or crush to pieces;
in the Woods they are not so much to be dreaded as
in the Plains, because their large Horns are apt to
entangle in the Branches of the Trees, which gives
those who are surprized by them, time to escape the
danger. Their hides are put to many uses, the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
make Pitchers of them to keep their Water or
other Liquors in. Those on the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI>
are for the most part wild, and Strangers have liber∣ty
to hunt and kill them at pleasure for their own
use.</P>
<P>There are here abundance of Civet Cats;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vit Cat.</NOTE> this is
a small Creature very like our Cats, only that its
Nose is something sharper, and its Claws not so dan∣gerous;
the Perfume which it produces is engendred
in a small opening, which is under its Tail; it ap∣pears
not unlike a Grease, and is taken out from
<PB N="83" REF="57"/>
thence by little and little at a time, and is replenish∣ed
according as the Civet Cat is well or ill fed.
They drive a great trade in this Commodity at <HI>Ca∣licut,</HI>
but it is seldom to be got unfalsified, unless one
have the opportunity of taking it out ones self.</P>
<P><HI>Malabar</HI> has also Apes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apes.</NOTE> but not in such abun∣dance
as in some other parts of the <HI>Indies;</HI> they are
no where in so great numbers as in the Territories
of the Prince <HI>Sevagi,</HI> and in <HI>Canara.</HI></P>
<P>The Eastern Pagans look upon the Ape no other∣wise
than as a rational Creature, and believe that
they can speak as well as the rest of Mankind, but
that they forbear to make use of their Tongue, be∣cause
they would avoid those toils and hardships,
which Men endure.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Indian</HI> Pagans reverence them like
Deities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are reve∣renced by the <HI>Indi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> erect Statues, and consecrate certain days
which are celebrated by Sacrifices made to them;
in the Territories of all the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes that are
Pagans, it is forbidden by pain of death to kill
them.</P>
<P>It is a common thing to see them assemble and
appear in the Fields in great Companies, where
they will watch their opportunity to set upon the
Country Women, as they are going to Market,
and if not assisted by the Country Men, take away
from them their Eatables. The Females always
keep their young ones close in their Arms, whom
they will not part with upon any occasion whatso∣ever,
so that one may see them tip from one Tree
to another, with their young ones, as nimbly as if
they were alone. They will make great havock a∣mong
the Fruits of the Earth, but especially they
are great Lovers of Rice, and of the <HI>Tari,</HI> which
they will Drink out of the Vessels that are fastned to
the <HI>Cocoes.</HI></P>
<P>This Creature being always in motion, appears
at first sight to be very timorous, notwithstanding
which it is very fierce, and gives sometimes very
evident signs of a most undaunted courage.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="58"/>
One of my Acquaintance being abroad a Hun∣ting,
in the Kingdom of <HI>Cananor,</HI> had seated him∣self
under a Tree to eat some Comfits he had in
his Pocket; a very large Ape sat watching him
all the while upon the same Tree, to see whether
he would not leave something behind him, but be∣ing
discovered by the Gentleman as he rose out of
his place, he Shot him with his Fusee in the Bel∣ly;
the Ape without stirring from the place, or
showing the least sign of fear, tore the Wound
open with his Fingers, took hold of one of his
Guts, and so drew them out very leisurely, till he
dropt down dead upon the Ground.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some other Animals of Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>OXEN are only employed in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> to
Cultivate the Ground, and the <HI>Pagans</HI> pay
them too much reverence to kill and to eat them.
There is abundance of Wild Boars in <HI>Malabar,</HI>
and the <HI>Nahers,</HI> (Gentlemen of <HI>Malabar,</HI>) make it
their chief diversion to Hunt them; they all eat
Pork here, unless it be the <HI>Bramans,</HI> and <HI>Nam∣bouris.</HI>
They have also good store of Mutton and
Roe-bucks.</P>
<P>They go also frequently abroad to Hunt the <HI>Gase∣let;</HI>
this is a Creature extreamly like a Stag, but
that its Horns are plain, and its Body something
less; they take them with Nets, which is the ge∣neral
way of Hunting in the <HI>Indies.</HI> There are no
Rabbets in this Country, but Hares in abundance;
they are not eaten by the Inhabitants, and when
they catch them, they sell them to the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="58"/>
There are very few places in the World but
where Adders are to be met with, but those of the
<HI>Indies,</HI> and especially of the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI>
having something extraordinary beyond the rest,
deserve particularly to be taken notice of here.
I had heard so many surprising things of them be∣fore
I came into this Country, that I look'd upon
them for the most part as Fables, contrived on
purpose by Travellers, to deceive the credulous
people; but I have since been convinced by my
own Experience; nothing being more certain than
what I am going to relate concerning the Adders on
the Coast of <HI>Malabar.</HI></P>
<P>Some of them are not above an Inch thick, but
5 or 6 Feet long, and of a Greenish Colour, so
that they are not easily to be discerned in the Grass
and Bushes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adders in <HI>Malabar.</HI></NOTE> where they lie lurking to seize upon
such as pass by, and commonly endeavour to fa∣sten
either on their Eyes, Noses, or Ears. They
don't Communicate their Poyson by making an
impression with their Teeth, but they have a little
Bladder full of a very subtil Poyson under their Necks,
from whence issues that venomous substance, which
in spite of all the best Antidotes, always proves
Mortal, and that in less than an Hours time. These
Adders being so very frequent and difficult to be
discovered in these parts, all persons of any Fashi∣on
when they Travel, cause their Servants to go
before them at a certain distance, who with little
rods beat the Bushes, the better to discover those
dangerous Insects.</P>
<P>I knew an <HI>Indian</HI> who being a Christian, Tra∣velled
with a <HI>Pagan Indian</HI> from <HI>Basarto Batiepatan,</HI>
to visit one of their <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples; but whilst
they were upon the Road, one of these Green Ad∣ders
all upon a sudden fastned upon the <HI>Pagan In∣dian</HI>'s
Nose, and creeping into his right Nostril,
got out through the left, where she remain'd till
the poor Fellow fell down Dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P>There is another kind of Adders in <HI>Malabar,</HI>
called by the <HI>Indians Nalle bambou,</HI> that is to say,
<PB N="86" REF="59"/>
the good Adder; and by the <HI>Portugueses Cobra capel,</HI>
because it has a Skin of the breadth of a Hand
hanging over▪ its Head of divers Colours, as if it
were enamell'd, as all the rest of the Body is of a
very lively and agreeable Colour. The bite of
this Adder is not accounted so dangerous as the
former, for tho' it often proves Mortal, yet its
fatal consequences are sometimes prevented by pro∣per
Antidotes.</P>
<P>One cannot but be surprized at the most stupid
ignorance and blindness of those <HI>Pagans,</HI> who pay
a most profound reverence to all sorts of Reptils,
but especially to the Adders; their Statues ma∣king
up the chief Ornaments of their Temples.
They are blinded to such a degree of superstition in
regard of these Creatures, that it is impossible to
undeceive them, and to make them open their
Eyes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstition of the <HI>In∣dians</HI> con∣cerning Adders.</NOTE> For if an Adder appear in a House, they
first Address their Prayers to her, and if these
don't prevail, they endeavour to draw her away
from the House, by offering of it Food without
Doors; and if the Adder notwithsta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng this
will not quit the House, they are so far from at∣tempting
to dislodge her by any violent means,
that they daily apply their Rhetorick and Addres∣ses
to her, no otherwise than if she were a ratio∣nal
Creature.</P>
<P>A Secretary belonging to a certain Prince in those
parts, was at the time whilst I was in the Country,
wounded by one of these Adders; She was 8 Foot
long, and of the thickness of a Man's Arm; this
accident happening in the Country, the Secreta∣ry's
Servant took the Adder, which they enclosed
in an Earthen Vessel, and brought her up to Court;
a Convocation of the <HI>Bramans</HI> being held, they u∣nanimously
addressed their Prayers to the Adder,
intreating her in the most respectful manner that
could be, to spare the Life of the wounded Secre∣tary,
as being a person of great Ability in his Sta∣tion,
and consequently very useful to his Prince,
who threatned to burn the Adder, if She did not
<PB N="87" REF="59"/>
take care to keep his Secretary alive; but this
Adder being very stubborn as it seems, their Prayers
and threats proved equally ineffectual; for the Se∣cretary
being destitute in the Country of proper
Antidotes, died in a few days, to the no small re∣gret
of his Prince; notwithstanding which, being
perswaded by the <HI>Bramans,</HI> that his Favourite must
needs have committed some secret and erroneous
Crime against their God, who had thought fit to
punish him thus. In expiation of his Crimes, he
ordered the Adder to be carried out of his Palace,
where she was put in the Grass, with a great deal
of Ceremony, the Prince and all his Courtiers ha∣ving
paid her a great deal of respect, and ta∣ken
their formal leave of this Deity.</P>
<P>There are a great many among the <HI>Indians</HI> so
over superstitious in their Zeal as to carry every
day a certain quantity of Milk abroad, for the
nourishment of these Deities, that they may not
be obliged to seek for their Food, at or near their
Houses.</P>
<P>But if the ignorance of these poor people de∣serves
pity, the imposture of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramans,</HI> (their
Priests▪) ought to be detested by all the World.
There are among them some very well skilled in
Astrology, who have received some Tincture of
Learning, and are exactly well versed in the Hi∣story
of the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, and who consequently
cannot be supposed to believe themselves, what
they impose upon the Vulgar; I have often en∣tred
in Discourse with them upon that Subject,
and more especially with one who was my fami∣liar
Acquaintance, whom I used to upbraid with
their impostures, and in what abominable a man∣ner
they misemployed that talent, wherewith they
were intrusted by God; in thus grosly imposing
upon the credulity of an ignorant people by their
fabulous inventions, barely in hopes of gaining
some reputation, and a slender share of worldly
interest. He was so far from being moved or con∣vinced
with what I alledged to him, that on the
<PB N="88" REF="60"/>
contrary he persisted in justifying their proceed∣ings,
and had folly enough to endeavour to per∣swade
me of the verity of their Doctrine by the
following History. One of the Principal <HI>Bra∣mans,</HI>
belonging to one of the most famous Tem∣ples
among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> being very solicitous to
exhort his Auditors to Devotion, proposed to them
the erecting a Statue of Gold of an Adder, with
12 Eggs of the same substance, which being to be
effected by a voluntary Contribution, and the Sta∣tue
to be placed in a certain place within the Tem∣ple,
where it was to be Adored, he told them
that the same Statue in 6 Weeks time would not
only be turn'd into a live Adder of the same
bigness, but also hatch out of the 12 Eggs, so
many young ones, that would in time all become
Protectors of the said Temple. His proposition
being received with a general▪ consent, they con∣tributed
towards the erecting of the said Statue
with such a chearfulness, that it was soon brought
to perfection, and carried in great State by the
<HI>Bramans,</HI> followed by the joyful Acclamations of
a vast number of people to the Temple, where
it was set up in a place assigned for that purpose,
which was shut up close by the principal <HI>Braman,</HI>
till the 6 Weeks were expired; when having a∣gain
assembled the people, he went at the Head
of them to the same place where they had left the
Statue lock'd up before; and not finding the least
Remnants either of the Golden Adder, or the 12
Eggs, they unanimously concluded that they were
all turn'd into Living Adders. The Miracle was
followed by an universal Acclamation of the peo∣ple,
each of them striving to out-do the other, in
giving the most evident Demonstrations of Joy
for having been the happy Instruments of the pro∣duction
of those new Deities.</P>
<P>Tho' I could scarce forbear Laughing at the foo∣lishness
of this contrivance, yet the impudence
wherewith it was related by the <HI>Braman</HI> put me
into such a Passion, that I gave him sufficiently to
<PB N="89" REF="60"/>
understand that I was not to be imposed upon by
such Tricks; but he was so brazen faced as to per∣sist
in his former assurance, so that I was forced to
leave him to his own obstinacy.</P>
<P>But tho' the <HI>Pagans</HI> have imposed upon them∣selves
this as an unalterable Law, not to kill an Ad∣der,
the <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> are not obliged
to the same rule in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where you often
meet with them in your Dwelling Houses; nay,
I have several times found them lurking under the
Beds. What Antidote is most effectual to be made
use of against the Poyson of this Creature, I shall
have occasion to speak more at large hereaf∣ter.</P>
<P>The Adders of the largest size, are near 20 Foot
long, and of so vast a thickness, that they are able
to swallow a Man; but they are less dangerous
than the rest, because they are sooner discovered,
and consequently easier to be avoided. Besides,
that they are scarce ever to be met with, unless it
be in desarts; and, if they are sometimes seen near
great Towns or on the Banks or Shoar of the Sea
or Rivers, it is commonly after some great inun∣dation
of the latter, whereby they are sometimes
carried near to the abovementioned places; I ne∣ver
saw any of them but what were Dead, which
appear'd no otherwise than a Trunk of a large Tree
lying upon the Ground.</P>
<P>I heard once a Christian who had been former∣ly
a <HI>Pagan,</HI> relate a very remarkable History of
one of these Adders:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Remar∣kable Hi∣story of an Adder.</NOTE> It seems it was in Harvest-time,
and certain Country people being gone into
the Field to reap Rice, had left no body at home
but a Sick Child; which being got without doors,
had laid it self asleep, near the House, upon some
Leaves, where it thus continu'd till Night; all the
Domesticks being then returned from reaping, heard
some out-cries of the Child, which, being weary
of the fatigues they had undergone in the Field,
they did not much regard, as believing them to
proceed from the illness of the Child; but whilst
<PB N="90" REF="61"/>
Supper was getting ready, some of them having in
the mean while observing the Child to continue
its Cries, in a most lamentable manner, ran out
towards the place, where they found it almost
swallowed up by one of those Adders; one half of
the Child being within the Body of this venomous
Creature: It is easie to be imagined in what a
Consternation so unfortunate an accident put the
whole Family, but especially the Parents, who
did not know by what means to preserve the Child
from present Death; being afraid that if they
shou'd do any thing to exasperate this Creature,
it would at once devour the Child; after several
propositions made by the beholders of so Tragi∣cal
a Spectacle equally dangerous in the execution
of it, they resolved to try whether they could with
a good Cimetar cut the Adder asunder in the mid∣dle,
which was executed accordingly, with a great
deal of dexterity. But this venomous Creature
was so strong lived, as not to die immediately af∣ter
it was cut in pieces, so that it closed up the
unfortunate Child within the one half of his Body,
where it was soon venom'd so as that it dy'd in a
few Minutes after the Serpent.</P>
<P>One Evening we heard a Jaccal or Adive, cry
near our Habitation, which notwithstanding the
Barking of all the Dogs round about us, we per∣ceived
to approach nearer and nearer; whereup∣on,
the Servants being got abroad with lighted
Torches, made up towards the place, where they
heard the Jaccal cry, whom they found very near
devoured, by one of these Adders, who had que∣stionless
surprized him asleep; our Servants kill'd
both of them, and the Adder tho' not above 10
Foot long, yet was of such a thickness as to be
able to swallow so large a Creature as the Jaccal.</P>
<P><HI>Malabar</HI> produces Crocodiles of all sorts and sizes,
and here it was that I had my share in killing one,
as I have related before.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the people of Malabar, and their
Customs.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>Malabar</HI> are generally well
shaped, all of them Black, or at least very
Brown, but are not near so ugly as the <HI>Africans.</HI>
They let their Hair grow to a great length; they
don't want natural Ingenuity, but very rarely im∣prove
it by any useful Arts or Sciences. They
are very Treacherous, breach of Faith being their
daily practice. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> are accounted
the most perfidious, but the <HI>Pagans</HI> so closely fol∣low
their foot-steps in this point, that they almost
out-do their Masters.</P>
<P>The last of these two are the off-spring of the
Ancient Natives of the Country, and consequent∣ly
exceed the others in number. They are distin∣guished
into several Degrees, or Tribes. The first
is that of the Princes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Tribes a∣mong the <HI>Malabars.</HI></NOTE> the second of the <HI>Nam∣bouris,</HI>
or their chief Priests; the <HI>Bramans</HI> or com∣mon
Priests are of the third, and the <HI>Nahers,</HI> or
the Gentlemen of the fourth Rank. These as they
are by their Birth-right intitled to the prerogative
of bearing Arms, so they are not allowed to inter∣meddle
with Traffick, which if they do, they for∣feit
their Gentility, as they do likewise if they change
their Religion.</P>
<P>Those whom they call <HI>Tives,</HI> apply themselves
to Husbandry and gathering the <HI>Tary,</HI> or Palm-Tree-Wine,
these are also suffered to bear Arms, but
this is only by permission. The <HI>Moconas</HI> or Fisher-Men
are all obliged to live near the Sea-Shoar,
<PB N="92" REF="62"/>
and not permitted to follow any other Employ∣ment,
they are not suffered to bear Arms, even not
in case of the greatest extremity. The <HI>Mainats</HI> or
whiteners of Linen, the Weavers, and those that
make it their Employment to draw it, are divided
into so many different Degrees or Tribes.</P>
<P>The vilest and most contemptible of all are the
<HI>Pouliats,</HI> being despised by the rest, and living in
a manner like vagabonds in most wretched Huts,
made of the Leaves of the Palm-Tree; their whole
Employment is to watch in the Fields, where the
Rice grows. It is look'd upon as scandalous to
have any Conversation with them, nay, even to
approach them, and if any of the other Tribes
happen to speak to them unless it be at 10 or 12
Yards distance, they are obliged to purifie them∣selves
before they come into any other Compa∣ny.</P>
<P>If a <HI>Nambouri, Braman,</HI> or a <HI>Naher</HI> meets with a∣ny
of those <HI>Pouliats</HI> upon the Road, they command
them at first sight, to get out of the way, which
if they do not obey in an instant, they let fly at them
with their Muskets or Arrows, and kill them at
pleasure, provided it be not in some Sanctified
or Privileged place. If a <HI>Naher</HI> or Gentleman has
a mind to make trial of his Arms, he may shew
his dexterity upon one of those unfortunate wret∣ches,
without any regard to Age or Sex, or fear∣ing
to be called to an account for it. This vile
Generation being subject to so many disasters, it is
no wonder if they don't propagate so fast as the
rest of the <HI>Indians;</HI> their condition being look'd
upon so mean as not to be permitted to wear any
kind of Stuffs or Linen, but only to cover some
part of their Bodies with Leaves. They eat fre∣quently
Carrion, nay, even Insects, and what makes
them above all others abominable to the <HI>Pagan In∣dians,</HI>
is, that they eat Beef, which died a natural
Death. They are so despisable as that no Presents,
neither for their Gods, or their Princes, are ac∣cepted
of from them, unless it be Gold or Silver;
<PB N="93" REF="62"/>
but they are obliged to lay it down at a great di∣stance,
and retire immediately from the place, when
the <HI>Nahers,</HI> who are the Guards of the Prince's
Person, come and take it up, talking to them at a
distance, and giving them what answer is to be
made, without allowing them to approach within
20 Paces near to them. They are often fined in
very great Sums; and because it may seem strange
how they that are banish'd from all civil Society,
and have no way to improve themselves, should
be in a capacity to pay them; it is to be observed,
that the <HI>Malabars</HI> are so foolishly Superstitious, as
to Bury most of their Gold and Silver with them
after their Death, and it is look'd upon as a Crime
to Rob the Dead. But the <HI>Pouliats</HI> frequently
watch their opportunity to find out these hidden
Treasures, and to convert them to their own use;
which makes them to be considered among the
<HI>Malabars,</HI> as Sorcerers, and an infamous Generati∣on,
guilty of the most inormous Crimes; for which
reason it is, that upon the least suspicion they are
accused and condemned to Death. But the other
Tribes are not used with so much rigour, they be∣ing
not to be Convicted even in evil cases, with∣out
very substantial Evidence.</P>
<P>It is a fundamental Law among the <HI>Malabars,</HI>
as well as most other Nations of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which
they look upon as unalterable and never to be
neglected, to wit, That no body can rise beyond
the degree of his Tribe, wherein he is Born, and
let his Riches be never so great, neither he nor his
Posterity can exclude themselves from that Tribe,
or change their Condition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Nahers.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Nahers</HI> are the Gentlemen of the Contry▪
and may easily be distinguish'd from the rest
by their civil Demeanour and Conversation, as
well as by their Birth. There is a most ancient
Custom, which time has establish'd for a Law in
all the Kingdoms on the Coast of <HI>Malabar;</HI> that
all Strangers or others, who are not <HI>Pagans,</HI> are ob∣liged
never to Travel without a Guard of one or
more of these <HI>Nahers;</HI> this being an indispensible
necessity laid upon Travellers; because these Prin∣ces
never take cognisance of any violences offered
them, if they Travel without these Guards. If
they are to Travel from one Kingdom to another,
the <HI>Nahers</HI> of the place where they are, take care
to procure them out of the other Kingdoms, whi∣ther
they intend to go, some who are to conduct
them. To every one of these <HI>Nahers</HI> you pay eight
<HI>Tares per diem,</HI> which amounts to half a <HI>Fanon.</HI>
The <HI>Fanon</HI> is a small piece of Gold worth 16 <HI>Tares;</HI>
and the <HI>Tare</HI> is a small Silver Coin worth about a
half-penny. Each <HI>Naher</HI> has not above 4 <HI>Tares</HI> a
day, when he keeps Guard in a House, but when
he Travels he has double pay.</P>
<P>These <HI>Nahers</HI> have this most excellent quality,
that they never betray or abandon such Travellers
as they Guard upon the Road. If a Man happen
to lose his Life, whilst he is under their protecti∣on,
they will not survive him, but undergo the
same fate; if they should do otherwise, they would
be look'd upon as Cowards.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="63"/>
I have received a relation from very good Hands,
which well deserves to be inserted here: Two
Rich <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants Travelling along the
<HI>Malabar</HI> Coast, from the Northern to the Southern
parts, were pursuant to the Custom of the Coun∣try
Conducted by several <HI>Nahers,</HI> through the King∣dom
of <HI>Cananor;</HI> but coming to the Borders of
the Kingdom of <HI>Samorin,</HI> were provided with new
Guards, to protect them in their Journey through
that Kingdom. But these perfidious wretches be∣ing
inticed by the great quantity of Gold and
Jewels these Merchants carried with them, Mas∣sacred
them, and having robbed them of all their
Precious Moveables, retired to another Kingdom,
in hopes to find shelter there against the severity
of the Law. After the first, to whose care they
were committed, were returned to their homes,
the News of the Murther soon spread over the
Country, their Dead Carcasses having soon after
the Fact was commited, been discovered by some
others Travelling on the same Road; they were
examined concerning their Conduct, and having
given an exact Account, to whose care they had
left these Merchants, these Ruffians Names were
soon known, and consequently they were appre∣hended,
and sent to their Native Country, to re∣ceive
condign Punishment. Some part of the Trea∣sure
which they had taken from the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Merchants being found upon them, when they
were seized, was a convincing proof of their Guilt,
wherefore being Condemned to Death, their Wives
and nearest Kindred appear'd at the place of Ex∣ecution,
telling them, <HI>That since they had Commit∣ted
a Fact tending so much to the Dishonour of their
Family, they ought to be the Executioners, and so dis∣patch'd
them out of the way.</HI></P>
<P>There is another thing worth observing of these
<HI>Nahers;</HI> That Travellers who are Conducted by
a good number of these Guards, are often expo∣sed
to more danger, than if they were guided by
one of their Children; it being the custom of the
<PB N="96" REF="64"/>
<HI>Indian</HI> Robbers, never to hurt any Children or
such as are not able to defend themselves; but
never to spare any that are provided with Arms for
their Defence.</P>
<P>When these Children of the <HI>Nahers</HI> Travel in∣to
the Country, they are only provided with a
twisted Stick of a Foot and a half long, with a
handle a-top most like our Daggers or Bagonets;
but in lieu of being sharp at the end, it is as thick
at the bottom as a Fist; and this kind of Stick
they make use of till they come to the Age ap∣pointed
for their bearing of Arms. No body but
the Sons of the <HI>Nahers</HI> are permitted to wear such
a Stick, by which they are distinguish'd from the
rest, and when they thus Travel, they are not
allowed above three half-pence a day apiece.
But though this be the securest way of Travel∣ling,
none but the Poorer sort make use of them,
because that Travellers are commonly respected
in this Country according to the number of Guards,
which attend them from one place to ano∣ther.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some other Customs of the Malabars.</HEAD>
<P>THose of a higher Rank are obliged to have no
commerce with the inferiour Tribes, especial∣ly
in respect of Eating and Drinking, in which
point they are so scrupulous, as not to permit their
Victuals to be dressed by those of an inferiour Rank,
but rather, if possible, by one of a more noble De∣gree;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicety of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> in re∣spect of their Qua∣lity.</NOTE>
nay, such is their nicety, as not to make use
of the same Wells, where those of an inferiour con∣dition
fetch their Water. The same precaution is
observed in respect of their Lakes, where they pu∣rifie
themselves, the Rivers being only common to
all without distinction. They are no less Ceremoni∣ous
in their Houses, where if any of a lower Rank
happen to enter, the <HI>Braman</HI> is sent for, to take a∣way
the infection by certain Ceremonies used for
that purpose.</P>
<P>But above all, they observe this Rule with the
greatest exactness in the World, when they con∣tract
any Alliances by Marriages; nay, they are
even debar'd from having commerce with a Woman
of an inferiour Degree. Thus a Man may marry a
Woman of the same Quality with himself, or at
most of the next Degree under his, but not of a su∣periour
Degree; if any of either Sex are convicted
of having transgressed in this point, they are punish∣ed
with Death, except the Females of the Race of
the <HI>Nambouri's</HI> and <HI>Bramans,</HI> who have this particu∣lar
privilege belonging to them, That, if they are
surprized in any thing of this Nature, they are to
be left to the Prince's disposal, who sells them for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as they are generally the handsomest
<PB N="98" REF="65"/>
amongst the <HI>Malabars,</HI> so Foreigners are very eager
to purchase them at a dear rate.</P>
<P>Of this I saw an instance at <HI>Cananor,</HI> where a <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
Captain, who lately had lost his Ship at Sea,
to comfort himself for his loss, bought a handsome
<HI>Indian,</HI> the Daughter of a <HI>Braman,</HI> who had been
surprized in the very act with a <HI>Tive</HI> or Country∣man.
He happening to pass by our Habitation
with his pretty Slave, we entertained them with
the best we had, and asking the <HI>Indian</HI> Lady some
Questions concerning her adventures, she at first
would give us no answer; but at last bursting out
into Tears, she told us, That after the death of her
Mother, she lived with an Uncle of hers, who used
to send her frequently with some other young Maids
of the same Quality into the Field to look after his
Grounds; where having seen this young <HI>Tive,</HI> she
began to feel at first some tender sentiments for
his Person, but considering the inequality of their
Extraction, check'd her inclinations for some time,
till the young Countryman being become sensible of
her Passion, did by degrees so strongly insinuate
himself into her Affection, that in spite of all the ri∣gour
of the Law, he became absolute Master of her
Heart, so that she resolved to admit him privately
into her Uncle's House, which was done according∣ly
to her utter destruction, they having been so un∣fortunate,
as to be surprized the very first time,
where the poor <HI>Tive</HI> was sacrificed immediately be∣fore
her Eyes to the revenge of her Family, and she
conducted to the Prince, who according to the cu∣stom
of the Country, had sold her to the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Captain.</P>
<P>The Tears wherewith she accompanied her Nar∣ration
sufficiently testified the tenderness she had for
the unfortunate young Peasant, so that there was not
one of the whole Company, who did not shew a
great deal of Compassion for this unfortunate Crea∣ture.
But the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who, like all the rest of
that Nation, was of a very jealous Nature, not ap∣proving
of our tenderness for his handsome Slave,
<PB N="99" REF="65"/>
would not allow her to stay any longer near our
Company, but having ordered her to be conducted
to another place, he caused her to be Baptized,
when she lived with him, where I have several
times afterwards had the opportunity to see her.</P>
<P>If a Man of an inferiour degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severe pu∣nishment a∣mong the <HI>Malabars.</HI></NOTE> be accused of ha∣ving
received a favour from a Lady of a Rank su∣periour
to his, they conduct him loaden with Fet∣ters
on Hand and Feet to the Prince, where he is
put to death; but what is the worst of all, is, That
the death of the Criminal alone is look'd upon as in∣sufficient
to expiate the Crime; for the three next
ensuing days, after the Execution, the nearest kin∣dred
of the Lady, have free liberty to kill all such
Relations as they meet with, of him who has enjoy∣ed
the Lady, without any distinction of Age or Sex,
but this does not extend any further than in the same
district or jurisdiction, where the fault has been com∣mitted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nahers</HI> have a power to exercise this cruel∣ty
upon such occasions against the <HI>Tives</HI> and <HI>Cheres</HI>
or Weavers, as these have the same power over the
<HI>Mokcona's</HI> or Fishermen, and these again over the
<HI>Pouliats.</HI> The <HI>Nambouri's</HI> and <HI>Bramans</HI> are not al∣lowed
to kill any body, so that their authority
extends no further in this point, than to deliver
up these poor victims to the Slaughter. This
custom is the most cruel in the whole World,
and would be altogether insupportable, were it
not that they commonly keep these Criminals for
the space of eight days alive, whereby their nearest
Relations, who stand in fear of their Enemies, have
sufficient leisure given them to get out of the way,
till after the expiration of the three days allotted by
the Law, for revenging the affront put upon the
Family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A further Account of their Customs.</HEAD>
<P>THey don't look upon it as a Crime to kill a
<HI>Pouliat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Murther not punish∣ed with death.</NOTE> neither is any body to be call'd to an
account for it; nay, they very rarely punish mur∣ther
with death, though committed upon persons
of a more eminent Rank. The Law takes no cog∣nisance
of this point, so as to regulate the satisfacti∣on
on to be given for the Murther, leaving the whole
to the discretion of the Kindred of the murthered
Person, who revenge his death at pleasure.</P>
<P>But in case of any Robbery committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robbery se∣verely pu∣nish'd.</NOTE> they are
the severest people in the World, they having ge∣nerally
such an abhorrence to this Vice, as scarce to
spare any body that has but stoln a Bunch of
Pepper, or to the value of it, but he pays for it with
his life.</P>
<P>They have no close or barricado'd Prisons in <HI>Ma∣labar,</HI>
their Criminals are but slenderly guarded,
they are only Ioaden with Fetters, which are ne∣ver
taken off till they are either Discharged or Ex∣ecuted.</P>
<P>All causes both Civil and Criminal are pleaded
before the Prince, where both parties produce their
Evidences; if the accusation appear so doubtful as
not to be decided according to the Evidence produ∣ced,
the accused may clear themselves by an Oath
which is performed in the following manner.</P>
<P>They cause a piece of Iron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of taking the Oath by the <HI>Mala∣bars.</HI></NOTE> not unlike an hat∣chet
to be made red hot in the presence of him who
is to prove his innocence, which done, they lay up∣on
his Hand a leaf of the Bananas Tree, and a top
of that the hot Iron, which he is not to throw upon
<PB N="101" REF="66"/>
the Ground, till after the redness be gone; after
which, one who has the oversight over the Prince's
Laundry, standing by with a Napkin dipp'd in
water made of Rice, wraps it about his Hand,
and after having tied round about it a certain
Cord or Ribband, the Prince Seals it up with his
Signet: Three days after the Hand is opened,
and if there be no marks of any hurt done by the
Hot Iron, he is declared innocent; but if there
appear any impression made by the heat of the
Iron, he is look'd upon as a Perjur'd Person, and
Punish'd accordingly.</P>
<P>It is the Prince in Person, who is always to pro∣nounce
Sentence, from whence there lies no Ap∣peal;
and if the Criminal be Condemn'd to Death,
it is Executed immediately upon the Spot, only
leading him without the Precinct of the Royal Pa∣lace.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Indians</HI> in these parts look upon it as the
most glorious Action they can do, to Obey their Prince
without reserve, they have no occasion to employ
common Executioners upon such like occasions,
but the <HI>Nahers</HI> belonging to the Prince's Guards
are the most forward to execute his Orders against
these miserable Wretches; nay, nothing is more
common, than if the Crime be very heinous, for
the next Kindred of the Criminal, to strive who
shall be the first that shall give the fatal blow to his
Kinsman, to expiate as they say, the indignity he
has put upon the Family.</P>
<P>Their common way of putting Criminals to
Death, is▪ by running a Lance quite through their
Bodies, after which, they cut them into Quarters,
which are hang'd upon Trees.</P>
<P>In each Kingdom among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> there are
several Princely Families, which are altogether
descended and make up one Royal Line, superi∣our
in Rank to all the rest. It is a general Custom
in all the States of the <HI>Malabars,</HI> that after the De∣cease
of the King, the most Ancient of all the
Princes succeeds without the least opposition from
<PB N="102" REF="67"/>
the rest, so that a young Sovereign is the grea∣test
rarity that can be seen among the <HI>Mala∣bars.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing the New King does after his ele∣vation
to the Throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their right of Successi∣on.</NOTE> is, to chuse one from a∣mong
his own Subjects, whom he believes to be
most understanding and fittest for so high a Trust,
for his Lieutenant-General, who's Business is to
take upon him, the chief management of all Af∣fairs
of Moment. This is the highest dignity in
the State, and though it be always exposed to
Sail, yet does the King reserve to himself the Pre∣rogative
of choosing out of the Pretenders, such a
one as he likes best, and whom he thinks most
deserving, without any regard to his Birth or Qua∣lity;
so that a <HI>Naher</HI> or <HI>Chati,</HI> being invested with
this Dignity, will make himself to be obeyed by
the Princes themselves; tho' it happens also very
often that this Office is conferred upon Persons of
Eminent Quality. All their Acts and Letters Pa∣tents
are written with a kind of an Iron Pen, upon
the Leaves of the Wild Palm-Tree.</P>
<P>The King being fully satisfied in the Zeal and
Prudence of his Chief Minister of State, leaves
the whole management of Affairs to his Conduct,
and for the most part Lives in a retired place, but
with a great deal of Magnificence. This Governor
General manages altogether the whole Treasury;
it is he that makes Peace and War, without being
obliged to Communicate with any Body, unless it
be with the King himself, if, by reason of his great
Age, he be not incapable of taking cognisance of
publick Affairs; He remains always standing in
the King's Presence, permits not any of his Cour∣tiers
or Guards to enter his Bed-Chamber, and ne∣ver
speaks to him, without laying his Hand up∣on
his Mouth. He must be very careful in not
neglecting the least punctilio of these Ceremonies,
a fault of this nature not being to be repaired, un∣less
with the loss of his Office, the King always
reserving to himself the liberty of discharging his
<PB N="103" REF="67"/>
primier Minister from his place, when he pleases,
which however is very rarely seen in those parts,
where they act with a great deal of circumspecti∣on,
in a matter of so great consequence.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Cananor</HI> goes abroad, he is
either carried upon the Back of an Elephant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How their Kings and Princes ap∣pear in publick.</NOTE> or
else in a Palanquin, being Adorned with a Crown
of Massive Gold upon his Head, made not unlike
a Ducal Bonnet. This Crown weighs something
above 200 Guineas in Gold, and is always given
by the New Governor-General, immediately after
his Elevation to that Dignity, the Crown of the
last Deceased King being to be reposited in the
Treasury of the chief <HI>Pagod</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> Temple.
The King is surrounded by his Guards composed
out of the <HI>Nahers,</HI> under the sound of Drums and
Trumpets, and other Warlike Instruments. Some
Officers of his Court march at some distance be∣fore
the Guards, whose Business is to make way,
and to cry the King is coming. All the Princes
if they go abroad by themselves, as also the Prin∣cesses
are served with the same Magnificence; If
the Governour or Chief Minister of State be a
Prince, he goes abroad in the same Pomp, in re∣spect
of his high extraction, not of the dignity of
his Office. But if he be not of the Royal Fami∣ly,
he is only attended by his Guards, without the
sounding of any Instruments of War, neither is he
preceeded by any Officers who clear the way before
him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some other Customs of the Malabars.</HEAD>
<P>IT is sufficiently known that in all Political Con∣stitutions
Princes are considered as the Heads of
the Government, but among these <HI>Pagans</HI> their
Kings are (in all matters relating to Religion,) sub∣ject
to the <HI>Nambouri's</HI> and <HI>Bramans.</HI></P>
<P>Before I speak of their Marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they derive their Pedigree.</NOTE> it is to be ob∣served,
that the Children of the <HI>Malabars</HI> derive
their Pedigree from their Mothers, and that conse∣quently
they are counted to be of the same Race,
not of that of their Father's, the reason of which,
we shall have occasion to mention anon.</P>
<P>Princesses are Married here to the <HI>Nambouri's,</HI> or
<HI>Bramans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Rules they observe in their Marriages.</NOTE> and the Children begotten betwixt them
are Princes, and lawful Successors of the Crown,
each in their Rank. But, as there is not a sufficient
number of Princesses to furnish all the <HI>Nambouri's,</HI>
and <HI>Bramans</HI> with Wives, so they are allowed to
Marry Women of the same Rank with themselves,
and the Children begotten betwixt them are either
<HI>Nambouri's</HI> or <HI>Bramans,</HI> according to the Quality of
their Mothers.</P>
<P>The Princes Marry the Daughters of the <HI>Nahers,</HI>
but never any Princesses, and the Children begot∣ten
betwixt them belong to the Race of the <HI>Nahers,</HI>
and not of the Princes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nahers</HI> are obliged to Marry one of the
same Quality, or almost of the next degree to
themselves, to wit, of the <HI>Minats</HI> or <HI>Cheti.</HI> The
rest of the several Lines have the same liberty, to
Marry one of their own Rank, or one degree be∣low
<PB N="105" REF="68"/>
themselves, but, as we said before, the Wo∣men
must not debase themselves in the least de∣gree
in their Marriage, under pain of Death.</P>
<P>The <HI>Malabar</HI> Princes, the <HI>Nambouri's</HI> and <HI>Bramans,</HI>
as also the chiefest among the <HI>Nahers,</HI> have com∣monly
but one Wife, and they endeavour by all
obliging means in the World to engage them to
be faithful to them, and not to look out for ano∣ther
Husband, which is not in their power to pre∣vent
by any other than gentle means, this liberty
being allowed to the <HI>Malabar</HI> Women, provided
they don't Marry below themselves. For the <HI>Pa∣gan</HI>
Women in these parts (contrary to what is
practised among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI>) enjoy according
to the Custom of their Country this Prerogative,
to Marry as many Husbands as they please; and
what is the most surprizing, is, that all this is
done without the least disorder or Jealousie; for,
the Man when he comes to pay his Duty to his
Lady leaves his Arms at the Chamber-door, as a
sure sign to the rest, that the place is taken up, and
that they must stay his leisure before they can en∣ter.</P>
<P>Their Marriage-engagements are only during
pleasure, and when they are satisfied with one a∣nother,
they part as freely as they met. The or∣dinary
present which the New Married Men make
to their Wives, is, a piece of Linen Cloth, where∣with
to cover themselves.</P>
<P>It is from this Custom of Marrying so many
Husbands, and to abandon them at pleasure, that
their Children owe their Pedigree to their Mo∣thers,
it being impossible to know their true Fa∣thers;
neither are the Sons here considered as the
next Heirs, but the Nephews, but they must be
the Sister's Sons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> tho' they keep a most watch∣ful
Eye over their Wives, nevertheless do they ob∣serve
this Custom, in respect of Succession or Inhe∣ritance,
all over <HI>Malabar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="69"/>
They Marry their Daughters for the most part
at 12 Years of Age, and there are abundance a∣mong
them who bear Children before that Age,
tho' they are generally but very small, which may
perhaps be Attributed to their being Married at so
tender an Age.</P>
<P>Widwives are unknown in these parts, those of
a more advanced Age supply this defect in a
Country where they are Delivered with much
ease, in Comparison to what is done in <HI>Europe.</HI>
For the <HI>Malabar</HI> as well as the <HI>African</HI> Women,
are no sooner Deliver'd, but they wash themselves,
and take no further care of their Babes, than to
give them Suck.</P>
<P>The <HI>Malabar</HI> Women are for the generality well
shap'd, and not ill Featured, but the little ones are
in greater esteem than the tall ones; the privi∣lege
of Marrying so many Husbands as they please,
exempts them from that most cruel Custom of burn∣ing
themselves with the Dead Carcasses of their
Husbands, to which the rest of the <HI>Indian</HI> Women
are Subject.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="33" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Habits and Houses.</HEAD>
<P>AS to their Habits, there is scarce any difference
betwixt the Men and the Women in <HI>Mala∣bar;</HI>
they wear their Hair, which is Black, ve∣ry
long, and go Naked as far as the middle; even
the Princes themselves, who, if they sometimes
make use of a small Vest, always leave it open be∣fore.
They wear about their Middle a piece of
Cloth, which comes down as low as their Knees,
and never make use of Shooes or Stockings.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="69"/>
In other Countries Ladies of Quality endeavour
to out-vie one another by their rich Gold and
Silver Stuffs; but the quite contrary is practised
among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> where these Stuffs are not
worn but by the meaner sort, the Ladies of the
<HI>Nahers</HI> and all the rest of a Superiour Rank wear∣ing
nothing but fine White Callico. The richer
sort wear Girdles of Gold, and Bracelets of Silver
or Horn, in which, they take all most particular
Pride. The Women never adorn themselves with any
Jewels, unless it be a Ring. Both Men and Wo∣men
have holes in their Ears, which are so long,
that they hang down quite to their Shoulders;
because they are so careful in continually enlarg∣ing
the holes, that you may thrust a Fist into them,
which is occasioned by the weight of the Pendants,
who sometimes exceed two Ounces; some of
them wear Golden Chains, but these being the pe∣culiar
marks of the King's favour, are never be∣stow'd
but upon such as have signalized themselves
by some remarkable Action. All the <HI>Malabars</HI>
Shave their Beards close, except some few, that
wear Mustachio's.</P>
<P>Their Houses are commonly made of Earth, and
instead of Tiles they cover them with the Leaves
of the <HI>Cocoe</HI>-Tree, it being a great rarity here to
see a House of Stone or Brick. Their Furniture
consists in some Baskets and a few Earthen Pots and
Dishes; their Cups are of the same matter, and
their Kings themselves make use of them as the
<HI>European</HI> Princes do of Gold and Silver Vessels.
They have no other Light at Nights, but what
their Lamps furnish them with, which are sup∣ply'd
by the Oyl drawn from the Cocoes; when
they eat, they always turn their Back to the Light.
As they are never sensible of Cold here, so they
don't make use of Chimneys, but what Fire they
have occasion for, to dress their Victuals, is made
without Doors. Wheat being a scarce Commodi∣ty
in this part of the <HI>Indies,</HI> they make use only
of Rice instead of it. Their Dishes are dressed
<PB N="108" REF="70"/>
without Sauces, and consequently very unsavory;
their Beds are nothing else but Deal Boards, which
the Richer sort cover with Tapestry suitable to their
Quality, and the Poor only with Mats. There is
no Villages to be seen all over <HI>Malabar,</HI> every
one has his separate Habitation, and inclosure in
the Country; and, it is impossible for all of them
to live near the River side, and that it is a constant
Custom among them, not to make use of their
Neighbour's Water, there is no House so inconsidera∣ble
but what has a Well of its own.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Riches of their Pagan Temples.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples are most Magnificent,
being generally covered with Copper, and
sometimes with Silver. There is always a Basin
near the Temple, proportionable in bigness to the
largeness of the Temple, where the <HI>Pagans</HI> purifie
themselves before they approach their Idols. The
number of the <HI>Bramans</HI> is regulated according to
the Revenues belonging to the Temple. Every
day there is a certain quantity of Rice allotted for
the use of the Poor that live near it, as also for the
benefit of such Strangers as pass by that way, let
them be of what Religion they will; the <HI>Pagans</HI>
having only this Prerogative to enter within the
Temple, whereas, the others are obliged to remain
without Doors, under certain Barracks made for
that purpose, where they may Sleep, if Night
surprize them in their Journey.</P>
<P>Besides the ordinary Revenue of these <HI>Pagan</HI>
Temples, the people bring every day their Of∣ferings,
<PB N="109" REF="70"/>
which are given to the <HI>Bramans,</HI> who are
to offer it to the Idols. And as these Offerings don't
consist in any thing that has Life, so they are most
commonly Rice, Butter, Fruits, Preserves, Gold,
or Silver; the two last are but rarely offered, and
the rest serve the <HI>Bramans</HI> for the Maintenance of
their Families, they having no more to do than
to bring forth their empty Dishes to these ignorant
people, who think it a Crime to believe otherwise,
than what they have offered to have been consu∣med
by the Idols.</P>
<P>Some of the richest Temples have large Terri∣tories
belonging to them, from whence, they draw
their yearly Revenues; and if any one happen to
spill Blood in these Grounds, tho' in his own de∣fence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preroga∣tive of their Sacred pla∣ces.</NOTE>
and upon the most Innocent occasion in the
World, the Crime is unpardonable, and he that
commits it is punish'd with Death, without the
least respect to his Merits or Quality; nay, they
use so much Rigour in this point, that if any one
saves himself by flight, the next a-kin to him must
pay for it with his Life, to expiate, as they say, the
hainousness of the Crime committed against the Ma∣jesty
of the Gods.</P>
<P>Of this I saw an instance, during my stay in these
parts: Two <HI>Nahers</HI> passing through the Burrough or
Market-Town of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> and seeing a Rich Mer∣chant,
who was a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> receive a considera∣ble
Summ of Money in Ducats, took a resolution
to lie in wait for him at a certain place, through
which he was to pass, to kill him, and seize the
Money for their own use. Accordingly they fol∣lowed
him at some distance, till they overtook him
at a certain place, which they believed to be be∣yond
the Precinct of the Territories belonging to
the Temple of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> where they run him
through in several places, till they had killed him,
and so retired to <HI>Calicut,</HI> under the Jurisdiction of
the King of <HI>Samorin.</HI> The Dead Carcass of the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Merchant having been soon after found,
the <HI>Bramans</HI> were consulted, and being come to the
<PB N="110" REF="71"/>
place, they declared that he that had committed
the Murther, had defiled the Holy Ground of their
Idol, the place being within the Territories (which
are of a very large extent,) belonging to the Tem∣ple.
Complaints being made hereof to Prince <HI>O∣nitri,</HI>
he caused an exact enquiry to be made af∣ter
the Malefactor's Names and place of Abode,
who being two Brothers, they were Summon'd to
make their Appearance before the Prince, but be∣ing
no where to be found, they were Condemn'd
to Death, as if they had been present; and to ex∣piate
the Crime, an Unkle of theirs, so far advan∣ced
in Years, as not to be able to walk, without lean∣ing
upon some Body, was carried before Prince <HI>O∣nitri,</HI>
who examin'd him concerning the Fact and
the Flight of his Nephews; he answered, that he
was ignorant both of the causes and manner of the
Flight of his Nephews, but this availed but little;
for the Prince told him that he would give him
8 Days to find out his Nephews, and if in the mean
time he did not bring them forth, he should be
proceeded against as a Criminal. The poor Old
Man did what he could to save his Life, but in
vain, so that the next day after the prefixed term
was expired, he was Condemn'd to Die, and not∣withstanding
his Old Age, his Innocence, and the
Intercession of his Friends, was immediately execu∣ted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Idols.</HEAD>
<P>BEsides that these <HI>Pagans</HI> Worship many Idols,
which have no resemblance to any thing in the
World; there are several kinds of living Creatures,
whom they adore, but the most profound respect
they pay to the Sun and Moon. As at the new
Moon, they make great rejoycings, so when she
is Eclipsed, they appear abroad, making most hor∣rible
out-cries, whereby, as they say, they frighten
away the Dragon, who then endeavours to devour
the Moon. They use the same Veneration to their
Kings, as they do to their Gods, and they Reve∣rence
old Age to so high a Degree, that even the
most Potent and Richest of the <HI>Nahers,</HI> will not sit
down before those that are considerably older than
themselves, though their Enemies.</P>
<P>They count their time by the Moon, notwith∣standing
which, their Festivals are not fixed to
certain days, this depending meerly on the Capri∣cio
of the <HI>Bramans.</HI> These Priests are very ex∣act
in their Fasts, and upon any Solemn Day, they
call together such as live within a reasonable di∣stance
of the <HI>Temple,</HI> from whence they bring forth
the Idol, and having placed it upon an Elephant
very righly Harnassed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pro∣cessions.</NOTE> they carry it about in tri∣umph,
at the sight of which, the People to shew
their utmost Veneration, prostrate themselves up∣on
the Ground. The Elephant is surrounded by a
good number of the <HI>Nahers,</HI> who having each a
Fan tied to a long Cane in their hands, drive a∣way
the Flies; which, as the Bramans say, would
else be troublesome to their Gods, but in effect, be∣cause
<PB N="112" REF="72"/>
they would not incommode themselves. Whilst
the People make a confused Noise with divers In∣struments,
and their joyful Acclamations, one of
the <HI>Bramans,</HI> with a two edged Cymetar in his
hand, having some small Bells hanging at the han∣dle,
runs round about the Elephant, and after a
thousand ridiculous and extravagant Postures, which
are look'd upon by the People as Mysterious,
he wounds himself in the Head, offering his Blood
as a Sacrifice to the Idol, which is as little known
to him, as it is sensible of his extravagant impo∣stures.</P>
<P>Thus after having taken their Rounds through
such places as were appointed for that days Solem∣nity,
they carry the Idol back to the Temple in
the same manner, as it was brought out before. They
have also several other Ceremonies, which being a∣bominable
to relate, we will pass by in silence.</P>
<P>They burn the dead Bodies of their Princes, of
the <HI>Nambouri's,</HI> the <HI>Bramans,</HI> and the <HI>Nahers,</HI> but all
the rest of an inferiour Rank, are interred.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="36" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Arms.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the <HI>Malabars</HI> in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are very dexterous at their Arms.</NOTE> who are capable
of bearing Arms, use them with great Dexteri∣ty;
they take particular care to instruct their Chil∣dren
in those Exercises, and scarce are they able to
walk upwright, but they are furnished with Bows
and Arrows, which they make use of to shoot at the
Birds. They are so very careful in this point, that
in each Kingdom there are maintained certain Aca∣demies
at the King's Charge, where the young
People are trained up in their Exercise of Arms.
<PB N="113" REF="72"/>
The <HI>Indians</HI> are furnished with the materials for
their Arms from abroad, but they make them al∣ways
themselves for their own use.</P>
<P>Their Musquets are very light, though they are
six foot long, and there is no <HI>Naher,</HI> but he always
carries a mould about him for his Ball. They don't
lay the But-end of their Musquets to their Shoul∣ders,
but on their Cheeks, when they are going to
give fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE> and are most excellent Marks-men. They
make use also of a Lance, a Cymetar, and the Bow;
of the last of which they are masters to such a De∣gree,
that I have seen them frequently shoot two
Arrows immediately one after another into the Air,
with so much Dexterity, that the second hit the
first.</P>
<P>Their Bows are six foot long, their Arrows
three; the Iron at the point about three inches
broad, and eight long: They do not carry them
in a Quiver as they do at <HI>Suratte,</HI> where they are
not near so big, but they hold always seven or
eight of them ready in their hands. Besides this,
they have fastned to their sides with an iron Hook a
sort of a large Knife or Bagonet, of about half a foot
broad, and a foot and a half long; this they make
use of when they come to a close Engagement.
Those who wear Cymetars make use of Bucklers;
all of them wear their Arms without Scabbards or
any other Coverts, for which reason they are very
careful to keep them neat and bright.</P>
<P>The young People frequently perform their Ex∣ercises
of Arms in the presence of the Prince, or be∣fore
some others of the most eminent rank in the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>Those who have a more than ordinary esteem of
their skill in the exercise of Weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com∣bats.</NOTE> invite People
of Quality at certain times appointed for that pur∣pose,
to be judges of their Ability in the feats of
Arms, when the prize is given to such as behave
themselves best. Being animated by a double mo∣tive
of honour and interest, they attack one another
in these Combats, with so much vigour, that it
<PB N="114" REF="73"/>
most commonly costs the lives of several young fel∣lows.</P>
<P>If their happen to be a Family quarrel betwixt the
<HI>Nahers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Family quarrels how decid∣ed.</NOTE> they choose one or more of their vassels of
a mean condition on each side, who being well Fed
and Educated for that purpose, are appointed by
joint consent to decide the Quarrel. Time and
place being agreed on by the parties concerned,
the Prince appears there with his whole Court, in
whose presence these Gladiators being armed only
with certain Knives or Bagonets, invented and used
only for this purpose, fight naked till by the death
of one party or the other, the quarrel be decided in
favour of the Conqueror, who very often does not
long survive the Victory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Malabars</HI> are generally very patient, and
not easily put in a Passion; Besides which it ought
to be mentioned to their Honour, that they never
revenge themselves by any clandestine means, but
give themselves due satisfaction by the most ho∣nourable
ways that possibly can be, the use of poi∣son
being not so much as known among them.</P>
<P>When they go abroad into the Wars, they march
without observing the least order, without making
any account of Rank or File. They fight barely
out of a point of Honour, or at the most for a lit∣tle
Pillage, these Kings being most infected with
the Ambition of enlarging their Territories, it
brings a general received Custom among the <HI>Mala∣bar</HI>
Princes, to restore to one another, as soon as
the Peace is concluded, all that they have taken
during the War.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Mahometans in Malabar.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mahometans in <HI>Malabar</HI> owe their off∣spring
to such Foreigners of their Religion,
as formerly have settled themselves in those parts for
the conveniency of Commerce. For few of the
Pagans, but especially the <HI>Nahers,</HI> never apply
themselves to it, which is the reason, that most of
the Commodities imported, or exported, pass thro'
the hands of Strangers. The Villages or places in∣habited
by these Foreign Merchants, are called in
the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue, <HI>Basars,</HI> which is as much as
to say, a Market-place. The most considerable of
these trading places are generally seated on the Sea∣shoar,
or near the mouth of some River or another,
for the more conveniency of the Foreign Mer∣chants,
who are for the most part <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>The Mahometans dwelling in those parts are a vile
and treacherous sort of People, abundance of them live
upon Piracy, and attack all Ships they meet, with∣out
any difference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malabar Corsairs.</NOTE> provided they think them not
able to resist them; but what makes them most
dreaded, is, That they use their Slaves with a most
barbarous cruelty. Their Vessels resemble in shape
our Gallies, and are generally manned with five or
six hundred men; they call them <HI>Paros,</HI> and run
with them all along the <HI>Indian</HI> Coast, even as far
as the Red Sea. They very rarely attack any <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Vessels, especially if they be of any defence,
and if they happen to take any, it is commonly
done by surprize, seldom by open force.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="74"/>
If these Corsairs render the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas some∣what
troublesome, it is very safe travelling by
Land, especially, if you be conducted by some
<HI>Nahers,</HI> as you travel from one Town to another;
for robbing upon the High-way and Stealing, is
most severely punish'd, whereas Pirating is look'd
upon as a free Exercise, the Kings in those parts not
taking Cognisance of what is transacted upon the
open Sea, where they are perswaded the weakest
ought to submit to the strongest. These Corsairs
pay the tenth of what Booty they take, either in
Money or Slaves to the Prince, under whose Juris∣diction
they live; upon the Seas nothing is exemp∣ted
from their attempts, they attacking all they meet,
without any respect of Religion or Nation, or ha∣ving
the least regard to any passes, though given by
such Lords or Princes as they stand in awe of.</P>
<P>If their next Neighbours or their best Friends
chance to fall into their hands at Sea, they spare
them no more, than if they were the greatest stran∣gers
in the World, but load them with Irons till
they have paid their Ransom. These Pirats are
more ignorant and barbarous than the other Maho∣metans,
they are distinguished from the Pagans on∣ly
by their Beards, Turbants and Vests.</P>
<P>If they happen to take any Mahometans or Pa∣gans,
they only strip them of all they find,
but seldom make them Slaves, unless it be a person
from whom they expect an extraordinary Ransom.
The Christians are treated with more severity, and
are sure to die in Slavery, unless they be either ran∣somed,
or else embrace Mahometanism, when they
are much respected, and commonly are made Cap∣tain
of their <HI>Paros.</HI></P>
<P>At their first going abroad with one of those Ves∣sels,
their chiefest aim is to initiate the new Vessel
with the Blood of the first Christian Slave they take.
But among all the <HI>Europeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI> are their decla∣red Ene∣mies.</NOTE> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> most
frequently receive the bloody Marks of their most
barbarous cruelty; for which reason it is, that they
are declared Enemies to these Corsairs, and if they
<PB N="117" REF="74"/>
meet with any of them, they carry them for the
most part to <HI>Goa,</HI> where they put them in Chains
in their Galleys, or else keep them in Irons in the
<HI>Casal de Polvera,</HI> which signifies the Powder-House,
from whence, there is seldom any Redemption;
These <HI>Barbarians</HI> being naturally so covetous as
scarce ever to attempt the Redemption of their
Friends out of Slavery, unless it be sometimes a
Captain of their <HI>Paros,</HI> which however is scarce
ever granted by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who in requital
of the Cruelties exercised by them against their
Country-Men, rather choose to let them Die in
Bondage, than to make the advantage of their ran∣som.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> living among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> are
obliged to Accommodate themselves in all respects
to their Laws and Customs, unless it be in such
matters as are directly opposite to their Religion;
tho' the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in those parts are more Jea∣lous
to fill their Coffers, and in frequenting the
best Market-Town, than their Mosques.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The French Settlement at Tilcery.</HEAD>
<P>WE being seated at <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> in a place where
we wanted all manner of conveniency, by
reason of its distance from the Sea-side, as soon as
the two Ships called the <HI>Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Strong,</HI> had
set Sail in order to their return into <HI>France,</HI> we
made our Applications to Prince <HI>Onitri,</HI> to assign
us another more Commodious place for our Ha∣bitations,
which having soon been granted by the
means of some Presents, he himself settled us in a
<PB N="118" REF="75"/>
place called <HI>Tatichere,</HI> (afterwards by us named <HI>Til∣cery,</HI>)
being part of his own Estate, Situate about
4 Leagues to the South of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cananor.</NOTE> and 3 of <HI>Ca∣nanor.</HI></P>
<P>The last of these two places is Situate at 11 De∣grees,
and 40 Minutes North Latitude, in the
most Fertile and Beautiful part of the whole King∣dom.
Its Port is very fair and Commodious, du∣ring
the Summer Season, but dangerous in Winter.
It was in this place the <HI>Portuguese</HI> first settled them∣selves
after their first discovery of the <HI>Indies.</HI> There
is to this day to be seen a strong Tower Built of
Stone; which they had brought along with them
from <HI>Portugal;</HI> it is environ'd with a very good
high Wall, whereupon are Mounted above 100
pieces of Cannon; they soon after Built a very
handsome Town just by the Fort, and made them∣selves
so considerable in those parts, that they were
a Terror to all the <HI>Indians</HI> round about them. <HI>Ca∣nanor</HI>
is destitute of the conveniency of a River,
but this is supplied by a small Bay, where there is
very Commodious Landing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> having afterwards got a settlement
here under the protection of the King of <HI>Cananor,</HI>
the Inhabitants craved their assistance against the
encroachments made upon them by the <HI>Portugueses;</HI>
and these glad of so favourable an opportunity of
ridding their hands of their Rival's being assisted
by the <HI>Nahers</HI> of the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Portu∣gueses</HI> bea∣ten out by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> beat the <HI>Portugueses</HI>
after a most vigorous resistance, out of their strong
hold, rased the City, and kept the Fort for their
own use.</P>
<P>On the South side there is a very large Market-Town,
Inhabited by <HI>Mahometan</HI> Merchants, who
live there under the jurisdiction of a person of Qua∣lity
of their own Religion, who is nevertheless de∣pendant
from the King and his Chief Minister.
He that was there Governour all my time, was called
<HI>Atitaja,</HI> and was King of several of the <HI>Maldive</HI>
Islands.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="75"/>
These Islands are very Healthful and Fertile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mal∣dive</HI> Islands.</NOTE>
where by reason of their great Traffick, you may
be furnish'd with every thing the <HI>Indies</HI> afford. They
make use of neither Waggons, nor Coaches, but
instead of them use Elephants, Horses, and their Pa∣lanquins.</P>
<P>'Tis here that those <HI>Canas,</HI> which we call <HI>Bam∣bou's,</HI>
grow in great quantities. They are when they
come to perfection, as thick as a Man's Thigh,
and 20 or 30 Foot long; whilst they are very
young and tender they cut them and pickle them
in Vinegar. They slit them before they are dry,
to make Palanquins of them, but when they are
come to full perfection, they are sold at the rate
of 200 Crowns apiece.</P>
<P>Since the departure of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> from <HI>Ca∣nanor,</HI>
the <HI>Dutch</HI> are become as grievous to the In∣habitants
as the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and if their Pride was
insupportable to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the insolence of the
others is no less troublesome to them, so that in all
likelihood they would be forward enough to lend
a helping hand, to such as would attempt to drive
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> from thence.</P>
<P>At a League distance from <HI>Cananor,</HI> as you Tra∣vel
towards the South, you pass through a Town
called <HI>Carla,</HI> Inhabited by <HI>Tives</HI> and <HI>Cheti's,</HI> where
are made the best Callicoes, which retain the Name
of that place for their goodness sake.</P>
<P>A League further towards the South, you come
to <HI>Tremapatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trema∣patan.</NOTE> or as the <HI>Malabars</HI> call it, <HI>Talmorte,</HI>
being a very considerable Market-Town, Inhabi∣ted
by <HI>Mahometan</HI> Merchants. And hard by upon
a Hill, you see a Fort or Castle belonging to the
King, where there is no Garrison, tho' when the
Princes come that way, they always there take
up their Lodgings. There runs a very fair
River on one side of the <HI>Basar,</HI> or Market-Place,
which falls into the Sea not above 100 Paces
below it. This River is very broad, but so shal∣low,
that a Ship of above 100 Tuns cannot enter
it without great hazard. At its Entrance, (at a
<PB N="120" REF="76"/>
League's distance from the Shoar,) are abundance
of Rocks, and a small Island without any Inhabi∣tants,
where there is however very good Hunting;
besides which, it serves very often for a shelter to
such Vessels as in Tempestuous Weather cannot
make the River; there are no Corsairs at <HI>Trema∣patan,</HI>
but those who Cruise this way from the
Neighbouring Coasts, frequently lie perdue under this
Island, and wait for such ships as they intend to
surprize at their going into, or coming out of the
River.</P>

<P>We passed the Fort of <HI>Cananor,</HI> and the Town
of <HI>Carla,</HI> without meeting with any Pirates, but
as we made towards <HI>Tremapatan,</HI> we perceived one
to appear from behind the abovementioned Island,
making the best of his way towards us. Those
that knew them by the Bulk and Shape of their
Vessel, assuring me that they were Pirates, I to a∣void
the danger of meeting with them, ordered
our Vessels to get into a small River thereabouts,
and leaving them to be guarded by the <HI>Nahers,</HI> I
<PB N="121" REF="76"/>
Travell'd my self by Land, under the Conduct of
two of these <HI>Nahers</HI> to <HI>Tilcery,</HI> where I met with
the Ship called the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Marseille,</HI> Commanded
by Captain <HI>Perotin,</HI> who was formerly Lieutenant
in the same Ship, which carried me out of <HI>France,</HI>
as far as the Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Mada∣gascar.</HI>
Having told the Captain how our Ship
was beset in a small adjacent River, by a Pirate,
he sent out an Armed <HI>Chaloup,</HI> with 20 Men,
and 4 Patarero's, who, in sight of the Pirate, car∣ried
off our Vessels, without the least obsta∣cle.</P>
<P>The Ship the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Marseille,</HI> having immedi∣ately
received her Cargo of Pepper, Cardamom,

Capuchin, who by the Order of the Reverend Fa∣ther
<HI>Ambrosius de Previlly,</HI> of the same Order, and
Superiour of the Missionaries in the <HI>Indies,</HI> was
sent in Quality of a Missionary, to the Coast of

<P>That part which Prince <HI>Onitri</HI> had given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tilcery.</NOTE> or ra∣ther
Sold us for our Settlement, is Situate at 11
Degrees and a half North Latitude, a League distant
from <HI>Tremapatan,</HI> 3 Leagues from <HI>Cananor,</HI> and 4
from <HI>Batiepatan</HI> to the South. There is a House
Built according to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fashion, of Wood
and Earth, upon a rising Ground, in the midst of
an Orchard, containing betwixt 2 and 300 Co∣coe-Trees;
and something lower there is a large
inclosure full of Cocoe and other Fruit-Trees,
surrounded with a small Ditch. To the Land side,
there is a small Market-Town, Inhabited by <HI>Ma∣hometans,</HI>
who have there a Mosque, which is pi∣tifully
Built and as pitifully maintain'd, where the
<HI>Mahometans</HI> say their Prayers. On the Sea-Shoar
there are several Habitations of the <HI>Moncovas,</HI> or
<HI>Pagan</HI> Fisher-Men, and all round about it are ve∣ry
fair Grounds belonging to some of the Richest
<HI>Nahers</HI> of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="77"/>
<HI>Tilcery</HI> it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tilcery.</NOTE> as I have told you before, belonged
to the Prince <HI>Onitri,</HI> who Sold it to the Royal <HI>French
East-India</HI> Company, there being not another such
a convenient place for their purpose in the whole

<P>No sooner were the <HI>French</HI> put in possession of
the place, but they caused a House with Commo∣dious
Watch-Houses for their Merchandizes to be
Built out of such Materials as the Country affor∣ded,
all which, they fortified with all possible di∣ligence,
to serve them for a defence against any
surprize.</P>
<P>About the same time Father <HI>Gabriel,</HI> whom we

Dysentery, and being of Opinion, that the <HI>Indian</HI>
Physicians might be better Skill'd in the Distem∣pers
of their own Country, he sent for a <HI>Paudite,</HI>
(thus they call their Physicians,) who, notwith∣standing
the violence of the Symptoms, which to
me were no good Presages, promised to Cure him
in 3 days time, and in part he made good his
Word, for having given him a certain Medicine,
which, as far as I could judge was a Composition
of Opium, (by the <HI>Indians</HI> called <HI>Amphion,</HI>) of Oyl,
and of <HI>Jagra,</HI> or Sugar of the Cocoes, of which,
he was to take a Spoonful every Night and Mor∣ning,
he put an end to his Distemper and Life on
the 27th of <HI>June.</HI> By the loss of so good a Man,
we were deprived of the greatest Spiritual Com∣fort
we so much stood in need of in a Barbarous
Country, Inhabited by Idolaters, but as we were
forced to submit to Providence, so the Memory of
a person highly venerable for his Age, and other
rare Endowments, which begot a great respect in
the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> ought always to be Sa∣cred
among his Friends.</P>
<P>The better to secure our selves and the Effects
of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company at <HI>Tilcery,</HI> we were ob∣liged
for a considerable time to entertain 50 <HI>Na∣hers</HI>
in our Service, there passing scarce a day but
that we were Alarm'd by the Neighbouring <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="77"/>
who having conceived a Jealousie at our Buil∣dings
and Fortifications, openly threatned to take
the first opportunity to cut our Throats; which
obliged us to make our Application to Prince <HI>O∣nitri,</HI>
and to desire his Protection; but he being
at that time not at leisure to come in Person, the
Neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI> would not permit their
Workmen to assist us in finishing our Settlement;
at last after various obstacles to be surmounted,
and great Intreaties, Prince <HI>Onitri</HI> appearing among
us, and declaring that he would Protect us against all
that should dare to oppose us, he caused several of
those who had been most troublesome to us, to be
severely chastised, which put such a Terror a∣mong
the rest, that they did not disturb us for some
time after; especially when they saw that Prince
<HI>Onitri</HI> tarried thereabouts for full 6 Months, the
better to keep these mutinous people in awe by his
presence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Voyage of the Sieur de Flacour, into the
Kingdom of Samorin.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> who are in continual Broils with
one or other of these <HI>Indian</HI> Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War be∣twixt the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Samo∣rins.</HI></NOTE> did about
the same time renew the War with the King of
<HI>Samorin,</HI> being the most Potent among all the <HI>Ma∣labar</HI>
Princes. For some time the War was carri∣ed
on without any considerable advantage on both
sides, till the <HI>Dutch</HI> having got the better of the
<HI>Indians,</HI> made a great havock where-ever they
came, demolishing their Towns, and pillaging
their Temples, and at last laid Siege to a certain
<PB N="124" REF="78"/>
Castle called <HI>Batacota,</HI> or <HI>Trianvaca Catota Batacota.</HI>
The Fortress being very strong and of no small
consequence, and the <HI>Samorins</HI> having provided the
place with every thing necessary for its defence,
stood it out bravely at first against the <HI>Dutch;</HI>
but their heavy Artillery having disheartned the
<HI>Nahers,</HI> who defended the place, and the King ha∣ving
sought in vain for Succours among his Neigh∣bours,
who durst not break with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> judged
it most advisable to have recourse to the <HI>Europeans.</HI>
The <HI>Portugueses</HI> were not in a condition to assist
him, neither was he perhaps willing to give them
an opportunity of re-settling themselves in his Do∣minions;
wherefore he made his Application to
us, desiring our Assistance against his Enemies.
'Tis true, the War was not then declared be∣twixt
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> but considering that this
crafty Nation had all along thwarted our Designs
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> we resolved to embrace the party of
the King of <HI>Samorin.</HI></P>
<P>For which reason the Sieurs <HI>de Flacour</HI> and <HI>de Co∣che,</HI>
were sent thither from <HI>Tilcery,</HI> with full power
to conclude an Alliance with that King. They
were received with all imaginable Demonstrations
of Joy and respect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> side with the <HI>Samo∣rins.</HI></NOTE> and the King of <HI>Samorin</HI> among
other Articles, granted to the <HI>French East-India</HI>
Company, a tract of Ground in his Kingdom,
called <HI>Aticote,</HI> with all its dependencies, and the
Sovereignty it self, for the more convenient set∣tlement
of our Company. This place is not far
distant from <HI>Cochin,</HI> near a River capable of bear∣ing
Vessels of a moderate Bulk.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> having got scent of the Treaty con∣cluded
betwixt us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> Attack'd the
place more furiously than before, and the Prince
putting all his hopes in the <HI>French</HI> relief; the more to
encourage them to hasten to his assistance, promised
to put the Castle into their Hands as soon as re∣lieved,
which he caused to be Published near the
Enemy's Camp. But these were so far from being
frightned at it, that they push'd on their Attacks
<PB N="125" REF="78"/>
so vigorously, that the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> who was
constituted Governour of the Fort, after a brave
Defence found means to get out of the place;
and the <HI>Nahers</HI> discouraged by his departure, soon
delivered it to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who caused it to be
Demolished.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Samorin</HI> finding himself incapable
to sustain alone the Burthen of the War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace be∣twixt the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Samorins.</HI></NOTE> and be∣ing
disappointed in his hopes of a powerful suc∣cour
from <HI>Suratte,</HI> propos'd certain Articles of
Peace to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which being accepted of by
them, the Peace was Concluded; and the Sieur
<HI>de Flacour</HI> returned to <HI>Tilcery,</HI> having in vain en∣deavoured
to serve a Prince who had given him
many Demonstrations of his good will, and favou∣rable
inclinations to our Nation.</P>
<P>But as the King had been forced by an unavoi∣dable
necessity to clap up this Peace with the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI>
so all his thoughts were bent upon re∣venging
himself against them, as soon as the <HI>French</HI>
succours promised by their <HI>East-India</HI> Company,
should Arrive in those parts. For which reason,
he desir'd the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> to leave the Sieur <HI>de
Coche</HI> with him, who accordingly staid at his Court
in expectation of the succours promised by the <HI>East-India</HI>
Company.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">New Troubles arisen at Tilcery.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time our Enemies, who by the pre∣sence
and threats of Prince <HI>Onitri,</HI> had for some
time been kept in awe, being afresh encouraged by
his absence, began to be very troublesome to us.
The worst of all was that we did not only stand
in fear of the Neighbouring <HI>Nahers,</HI> and other <HI>Pa∣gans,</HI>
but the Corsairs of <HI>Bargara</HI> and <HI>Cognaly,</HI> also
threatned to come and Plunder us, and if they
found any resistance, to cut us to pieces. For
which reason we were forced to entertain a good
number of <HI>Nahers,</HI> and to put our selves in a posture
of Defence, as much as possibly we could, with a
resolution, rather to sacrifice our Lives, than to
submit to an intolerable Slavery among these <HI>Bar∣barians.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after the departure of the Sieur <HI>de Fla∣cour</HI>
for <HI>Samorin,</HI> there appearing a Vessel to the
South of our Shoar, with a White Flag, we also
set up ours, and an Ensign of theirs being sent
on Shoar, satisfied us, that it was the St. <HI>Francis,</HI>
a Ship belonging to our Company, Commanded
by Captain <HI>Vimont,</HI> having on Board the Sieur <HI>Pi∣lavene,</HI>
a Merchant of <HI>Paris,</HI> who was sent into the
<HI>Indies</HI> in Quality of a Director. This Vessel was
Bound for <HI>Suratte,</HI> and after its departure out of
<HI>France,</HI> having met with no Disaster till after
she had doubled the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> was At∣tack'd
by so furious a Tempest, that she lost her
Masts and some of her Ships Crew, and became ve∣ry
Leaky, which obliged the Chief Officers there to
<PB N="127" REF="79"/>
make a Vow, that if they happened to escape so
imminent a danger, they would go to pay their De∣votions
before the Corps of St. <HI>Francis Xavier,</HI> at the
place where it is deposited at <HI>Goa.</HI> After the Hur∣ricane
was abated, they refreshed themselves at <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI>
the Capital City of the Isle of <HI>Java,</HI> belong∣ing
to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> the biggest of all they are
Masters of in the <HI>Indies.</HI> Having provided them∣selves
there with what necessaries they wanted, they
were steering their course towards <HI>Goa,</HI> to discharge
their Vow, and from thence to continue their Voy∣age
to <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>This Ship did not continue above four and twen∣ty
Hours in our Road, in which time we took care
to send them on Board all manner of refreshments;
and the <HI>French</HI> Officers on board her, having under∣stood,
how we were kept in continual fear by the
<HI>Indians,</HI> presented us with some Cymetars, Mus∣quets
and Gun-powder, besides a quantity of Bran∣dy.
The sight of this Vessel, and the Arms which
they sent us wrought no small effect for our safety,
which we improved to our best advantage, by gi∣ving
it out among them, that we expected daily
more ships with Arms, Men and Ammunition from
<HI>France,</HI> which struck such a terror into our Enemies,
that they proved less troublesome afterwards. The
Sieur <HI>Deshayes</HI> Embarked in the Ship called the St.
<HI>Francis,</HI> having for some time before desired to be
dismissed, the Air of <HI>Malabar</HI> not being very agree∣able
to his Constitution.</P>
<P>After the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI>'s return from the King
of <HI>Samorin</HI>'s Court, we gave Notice to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> re∣siding
at <HI>Cananor,</HI> of the donation made to us by
that Prince, which they regarded as little as did
those inhabiting <HI>Cochin.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Arrival of several Vessels.</HEAD>
<P>A Little after, the Ship called the City of <HI>Bour∣deaux,</HI>
which came from <HI>Suratte,</HI> and was
bound for <HI>Mascate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mascate.</NOTE> a City of <HI>Arabia</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI>
Gulph, arrived in the road of <HI>Tilcery.</HI> The <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
had formerly settled themselves in that Port,
and for their security, built a new strong Fort, but
the <HI>Arabians</HI> chased them from thence, since which
time the <HI>French</HI> have settled a Factory there.</P>
<P>One Mr. <HI>Petit</HI> was Commander of the Vessel, he
staid but a little while in our Road, and sailed di∣rectly
to <HI>Mangalor,</HI> to load some Rice there. Be∣fore
his departure, he assured us, That the Sieur
<HI>de Caron,</HI> Director General of the <HI>French East India</HI>
Company in the <HI>Indies,</HI> being at his departure rea∣dy
to sail for <HI>Bantam,</HI> would certainly in a little
time pass by our way; upon which, having prepa∣red
every thing for his Reception, we placed con∣stantly
some Sentinels to observe whether any Ships
appeared towards the <HI>North;</HI> but having for some
time used our endeavours in vain, we began to i∣magine
that we had been mis-informed, when one
morning there came in sight of us the Ship called
the St. <HI>Paul,</HI> which was soon after followed by the
<HI>Vulture,</HI> and the St. <HI>Francis,</HI> in the last of which was
the Sieur <HI>de Caron,</HI> who was going to settle a <HI>French</HI>
Factory at <HI>Bantam,</HI> not far from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and ha∣ving
taken an exact account of the true State of
Affairs at <HI>Tilcery,</HI> he pursued his Voyage to <HI>Ban∣tam.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="80"/>
Prince <HI>Onitri</HI> having before received intelligence
of his arrival, came to pay him a visit, but he came
a little two late, the Sieur <HI>de Caron</HI> who was unwill∣ing
to let slip the opportunity of improving the ad∣vantage
of a fair Gale, being already under sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at
his Arrival. The Sieur <HI>de Caron</HI> however had sent
his excuses to the Prince with some presents, who
sent a Messenger after him in a Chaloup, who re∣paid
the Complement and regaled him with some
refreshments.</P>
<P>We had for a considerable time before laid a de∣sign
to settle a <HI>French</HI> Factory at <HI>Sirinpatan,</HI> called
by the <HI>Malabars, Padenote,</HI> which being communi∣cated
to the Sieur <HI>de Caron,</HI> before his Departure
from <HI>Tilcery,</HI> he ordered immediately the Sieur <HI>de
Flacour</HI> to take a Journey thither. He chose me for
his Companion, and notwithstanding the rainy Sea∣son
which continues for six Months together on
the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> resolved to undertake the
Journey without any further delay. I did all I could
to represent to him the inconveniency of travelling
at this Season, when the Roads by the overflowing
of the Rivers were perhaps rendred unpassable, de∣siring
him to delay his Journey for some little
time, but he persisted in his former Resolution, tell∣ing
me, That having but five and twenty Leagues
to travel, we should in all probability find the Roads
not so difficult to pass, as I imagined.</P>

<PB N="130" REF="81"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our departure from Tilcery.</HEAD>
<P>ACcordingly we set out from <HI>Tilcery,</HI> about the
middle of <HI>June,</HI> being conducted by some
Guides, and guarded by several <HI>Nahers.</HI> Our whole
Equipage consisted in no more than a Shirt and a
pair of Drawers; on our Feet we wore a kind of
Sandals, and to keep off the Rain, we were each of
us provided with an Umbrello, made out of the
leaves of Palm-trees.</P>
<P>The first days Journey proved extreamly trouble∣some,
being obliged to march all day long through
the Waters that had over flown the Roads, which
in some places came to our middle, so that we were
not able to travel above two Leagues the whole day;
at Night we took up our Lodgings which were sor∣ry
enough, in a small Market-Town, where we
dryed our Cloths without much difficulty, they be∣ing
all of Callicoe. Thus after a miserable Nights
Lodging, we continued our Journey the next Morn∣ing,
when we were refreshed with a small interval
of fair Weather, which however lasted but a few
hours. As we were marching through the Waters,
we were extreamly pestered with Horse Leaches,
which fastned themselves in great numbers to our
Legs, and fatigued us to that degree, that being
quite spent by Noon, we were forced to take up our
Quarters at the Habitations of some Mahometans.
In the afternoon the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> paid a visite to
the <HI>Naher,</HI> who though a Subject of the King of
<HI>Cananor,</HI> was Lord of the place, and without
whose consent we could not pass, which we easily
obtained by the means of a present. The next day
<PB N="131" REF="81"/>
we found the Road some-what better than we had
done hitherto, but another misfortune abated much
of our satisfaction; for after we had travelled near
four hours, we found our selves, being misled by
the ignorance of our Guides, near the same place
from whence we set out in the Morning. An un∣seasonable
anger would have stood us but in little
stead with those, who had us at their Mercy, and
in whom we were obliged to confide as our Con∣ductors,
so that patience was the best remedy we
could prescribe our selves, and thus we continued
our Journey in hopes of better luck. But we found
our selves soon deceived in our expectation, for we
had not travelled far, when the Rains began to be
more violent than ever, besides that we travelled
all over stony Grounds full of deep and large
Ditches, which we were forced to pass over small
Planks or pieces of Trees laid a cross. Armed with
Patience, and an unshaken Resolution to overcome all
Obstacles, we at last came to a Market-Town, in∣habited
by Mahometans, situated near a River
which runs by <HI>Cognaly.</HI> We were kindly received
by the Inhabitants, and the great Rains and pass'd
fatigues, obliged us to rest there for one day.</P>
<P>But, what we had suffered hitherto, was all it
seems nothing in comparison of what we were like∣ly
to undergoe for the future; the Dangers and Fa∣tigues
which were represented to us by these Ma∣hometans,
made so lively an impression upon me,
that I earnestly requested the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> not to
go further, and though every one there present was
of my Opinion, and gave himself fresh assurances of
the dangers and troubles he must undergo, he stood
firm in his resolution, to prosecute his Journey, in
order to dispatch his business before the return of the
Sieur <HI>de Caron.</HI></P>
<P>As for my part, I being not under any further
obligation, than to bear the Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> Com∣pany,
I thought it rashness to expose my life to dan∣ger
without any prospect of doing good; so that I
resolved to quit the Sieur <HI>de Flacour,</HI> and to take the
<PB N="132" REF="82"/>
conveniency of a small River, which discharges it
self not far from hence into the Sea.</P>
<P>According to this resolution, I hired a <HI>Canoe</HI> or
Boat, refusing to accept of the Fire-arms that were
offered me, because I did not imagine I should have
any occasion for them, being in hopes to reach and
lodge that Night at <HI>Bargara,</HI> in the House of <HI>Couleas
Marcal,</HI> a rich Mahometan Merchant, and famous
Pirate in those parts, with whom I had some Busi∣ness.
I passed without any hindrance, (having
only the Master and his Boy in my Company) by
<HI>Cotta</HI> or <HI>Cognaly,</HI> a Market-Town, from whence
the most famous Pirate in those Seas, whose Lord∣ship
it is, derives his Name; and thus being gently
conveyed by the current, I thought my self out of
all danger, as being near <HI>Bargara,</HI> when some Pirates
who had discovered me from far of, were making
towards me with their Boat. As I was not igno∣rant,
that all what these Barbarians lay hold on up∣on
the Water, they look upon as their own; we
made the best of our way to the shoar, but scarce
had we reach'd the Bank, when we perceived the
Pirates at the heels of us, which so terrified both
the Master of the Boat, and his Boy, who carried
my Portmantle, that they look'd for their safety in
the switness of their heels, leaving me to the mer∣cy
of those Robbers, who pursued me closely, till
they overtook me. I now began to repent my self
of having refused the fire-locks that were offered me,
one of which would have been a sufficient defence
against a couple of cowardly Rovers, who had no
other Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author taken by a <HI>Malabar</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> but their Lances. Finding me with∣out
any Arms, they soon knock'd me down, and
seeing there were no Witness of the violence offer∣ed
to me by Land, they forc'd me into their Boat,
and carried me back to <HI>Cognaly.</HI> As I was the first
of our Nation who had the misfortune to fall into
their hands, so I was conducted before their Chief∣tain,
who used his utmost endeavours to extort from
me a Summ of Money for my Ransom; but having
answered him that I had none to give, he asked me
<PB N="133" REF="82"/>
for what reason I had quitted the Sieur <HI>de Flacour,</HI>
and whether in his return he was to pass that way
through his Lordship; I told him, that I was not
able to give him an account, upon which he or∣dered
the Irons to be brought in, which were laid
close by me, so that I expected every moment to
be loaden with Irons.</P>
<P>But as good fortune would have it, this Chieftain
had heard something of the late alliance concluded
betwixt us and the King of <HI>Samorin,</HI> whose Subject
he was, which consideration together with the ut∣most
severity, used against such as commit Robbe∣ries
on Land, or in a River, had so good an effect
upon him, that he ordered the Irons to be taken a∣way,
and when I expected it least, turned the civi∣lest
man in the World, offering me his House and
every thing else for my conveniency.</P>
<P>But as I was eager to see my self at Liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at li∣berty.</NOTE> so I
returned him thanks for his offers, desiring him to
give me leave to go streight to <HI>Bargara,</HI> pretending
that I had business of great moment to transact
there that Night. He having granted my request,
and ordered a Vessel to be got ready, he presented
me in the mean while with some sweet Meats▪ of
which I took a few for Decency's sake, but did not
eat any of them for fear of Poison, though at
the same time it must be confessed, that Poison is
less known among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> than any other
Nation.</P>
<P>After I had taken my leave of the Pirate, I en∣tred
the Vessel which was to carry me to <HI>Bargara,</HI>
where I was no sooner arrived, but I met with the
same <HI>Canoe,</HI> which had left me before in the lurch,
the Master pretending that he had stay'd for me
there in hopes of my coming. But what rejoyced
me most was, That a certain Fisherman told me,
that there was very lately a <HI>Frenchman</HI> arrived in
this Market-Town. You may imagine, that I made
all the hast I could to find him out, and meeting
with my old Friend the Sieur <HI>de la Serine</HI> the Elder,
who was lately returned from <HI>Calicut,</HI> this happy
<PB N="134" REF="83"/>
meeting was no small comfort to me, for what I had
suffered during this troublesome Journey, of which
and the last adventure, I gave him an exact relation.</P>
<P>He having already settled matters with the Cor∣sair
who is Lord of <HI>Bargara,</HI> we travelled the next
day together to <HI>Tilcery,</HI> which being not above three
Leagues from thence, we arrived there before
Noon. There was scarce any body but was sur∣prized
at my sudden return, but at the same time,
approved of my Resolution, of not exposing my
self to the hazards of so dangerous a Journey, with∣out
an absolute necessity.</P>

one of the most fertile in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Bargara</HI> is about two Leagues distant from <HI>Mealy;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargara.</NOTE>
it is one of the most considerable Market-towns in
those parts, whether in respect of its commerce, or
of the riches of its inhabitants, who are most Pi∣rates:
It is destitute of a River, so that both the
Corsairs and Merchants are obliged to let their <HI>Pa∣ros</HI>

they want careening, or that they cannot hold out
against the violence of the Hurricanes. <HI>Bargara</HI>
lies upon the utmost Borders of the Kingdom of <HI>Ca∣nanor;</HI>
a certain <HI>Naher</HI> is Lord of the place, who,
though a subject to the King, yet enjoys the prero∣gative

<P>Not far from <HI>Bargara,</HI> there is a small Gulph made
by the River <HI>Cognaly,</HI> a place very commodious

in that part where it is adjoined to the Land, by rea∣son

Some years ago they revolted against the King
of <HI>Samorin,</HI> their Sovereign, who finding himself
alone not strong enough to reduce these Rebels to
Obedience, sought for aid by the <HI>Portugueses.</HI> These
having sent to his assistance a Fleet, he Besieged
them by Land, as they did by Sea, but with very
ill success; for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships having most of
them been tost by a Tempest, the King was for∣ced
to withdraw his Army, not without great loss,
without being able to reduce the Corsairs to their
Devoir. But the next year proved less favoura∣ble
to them; for the <HI>Portugueses</HI> being resolved to
revenge the Affront received the year before, made
a Descent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is carried to <HI>Goa,</HI> and Stoned to Death.</NOTE> routed them, and took their Chieftain
Prisoner, whom they led loaden with Chains to

these <HI>Barbarians,</HI> on account of the Cruel∣ties
exercised by them upon their Country-Men,
and other <HI>Europeans,</HI> he was stoned to Death by the

<P>One of his Nephews after having submitted him∣self

in his Estate and Employment, who has ever since
continued to Cruise upon the Merchant Ships with
such success, that he is dreaded all over the <HI>In∣dies.</HI></P>
<P>The Fort which has given the Name to the <HI>Ba∣sar,</HI>
or Market-Town, is Built at a small distance
from it, on the utmost confines of the Kingdom
of <HI>Samorin.</HI> From thence they count it seven
Leagues to <HI>Calicut,</HI> where you meet with nothing
but 3 or 4 small Towns, so inconsiderable as not
to deserve to be mentioned here.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Calicut.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAlicut,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Calicut <HI>or</HI> Coi-Cota.</NOTE> is in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue called <HI>Coi-Cota,</HI>
deriving its Name from two different
Words, the first whereof signifies as much as a
Cock, and the last a Fort; because, as it is related
among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Samorin</HI> was
in former Ages of no greater extent than you
might hear a Cock Crow. And tho' this Kingdom
be considerably augmented since, yet the City of
<HI>Calicut,</HI> (the principal of the Country,) retains the
same Name to this day.</P>
<P>It is Situated under the Eleventh Degree of North
Latitude, about 11 Leagues distant from <HI>Tilcery.</HI>
Formerly it was the Chief place of Commerce of
all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and though it be much declined from
its Ancient lustre, yet its Inhabitants are generally
very Rich, and most of them Merchants. This
was the place where the <HI>Portugueses</HI> first set foot on
Shoar, after their first Discovery of the <HI>East-Indies.</HI>
Their King who at that time kept his Residence in
that City, received them with a great deal of kind∣ness
and respect, granting them a considerable set∣tlement
in his Territories, but they were so far
from making a suitable return to his Civilities,
that they began to Lord it both over him and his
Subjects, so that the King thought himself obliged
to rid his Hands of these bold Guests; whom the
<HI>Samorins</HI> drove out of their Territories, and never
suffered them to re-settle there since.</P>
<P>All about <HI>Calicut</HI> there are very low Grounds,
subject to frequent Inundations, there being scarce
<PB N="141" REF="86"/>
a year but some part or other of this Kingdom is
laid under Water, by the overflowing of the Ri∣vers.
The Fort which the <HI>Portugueses</HI> formerly
had Built at a good distance from the Shoar, may
now be seen 2 Leagues deep in the Sea, above
half under Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Fort.</NOTE> so that you may frequently see
small Vessels pass betwixt that and the Shoar. These
Inundations are ceased by the strong South West
Winds, which blow on that Coast continually,
from <HI>May</HI> till <HI>September.</HI> Whilst I was there I was
an eye-witness of the Disaster that befel the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
whose Habitations, which had not been Built
many Years before, were entirely swallowed up by
the Waters.</P>
<P>The frequent mischiefs occasioned by these Inun∣dations,
has been one of the main reasons why the
Foreign Trade has in a great measure removed
from <HI>Calicut</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> which City, has laid the foun∣dation
of its greatness upon the Ruins of that of
<HI>Calicut.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Goa</HI> is the most considerable City of all the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
in the Possession of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who
wallowing in Riches, by reason of the vast Com∣merce
of the Foreign Merchant's Trafficking in
the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> grew at last so insolent and insup∣portable
to them, that they Transported their Ef∣fects
and Traffick to <HI>Suratte,</HI> which is now the chief
Trading place of all the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Calicut,</HI> is notwithstanding all this, accounted a very
good Market-Town, having 4 or 5 large and hand∣some
Streets; besides, the Suburbs, which are In∣habited
by Fishermen and <HI>Tives,</HI> all which joy∣ned
together make up a City of a pretty large
Bulk.</P>
<P>Since the Kings of <HI>Samorin</HI> have removed their
Court to another place, there resides here a Go∣vernour
(whom they call <HI>Bajador,</HI>) in the Royal
Palace, where there is as yet to be seen a very
large Bell, and some Brass Cannon, which were
brought thither, after they had chased the <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
out of their Fort.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="87"/>
Among the Sands of the Shoar there is good store
of Gold Dust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold Dust.</NOTE> which is very fine, and every Body has
the freedom to gather it at pleasure; the biggest piece
that ere I saw, was not worth above 15 Pence, and
commonly they are not worth above 4 or 5 Pence
apiece, abundance of people get a livelihood by
it; and with consent of the Governour (which is
to be purchased by a certain set Price, for the main∣tenance
of 100 Poor people,) you may have as
much Sand as you please, carried to your Dwel∣ling-places,
in order to separate it with the most
conveniency.</P>
<P>It is a considerable time since the <HI>English</HI> have
been settled at <HI>Calicut;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">English <HI>Factory.</HI></NOTE> but their Habitations ha∣ving
been ruined, (as we said before,) by the over∣flowing
of the Waters; they Built another House
in a rising and consequently less dangerous piece of
Ground. As in those far distant places the <HI>Euro∣peans,</HI>
tho' of different Nations, pay a great deal
of Civility to one another upon all occasions, and
as it would have been look'd upon by them as an
Affront, if we had not stopp'd at their Habitation
as we pass'd that way, we took up our Lodgings
with the <HI>English,</HI> who Entertain'd us with all the
Civility imaginable, and we staid with them much
longer than we at first intended, by reason that a
<HI>Paros</HI> of the Cosairs waited for our coming out of
the Port to surprize us.</P>
<P>Having staid for some time in hopes of his go∣ing
out of the Road, his Obstinacy at last over∣came
our Patience, and being resolved to run the
hazard, we rowed out of the Port in the middle
of the Day, but kept near the Shoar, in order to
Land if they should come to Attack us. But as
these Cowardly <HI>Barbarians</HI> seldom Attack any but
whom they believe either not to dare or to be able
to cope with them, our resolute Behaviour put
them to a stand, so that imagining us to be stron∣ger
than we were, they had not the Courage to come
near us. But this was not the only danger that threat∣ned
us, for we had not gone much further when espy∣ing
<PB N="143" REF="87"/>
another Vessel riding at a good distance from us
near the Shoar, put us into a great consternation; our
<HI>Nahers</HI> and Mariners having assured us that it was
without the least doubt a Corsair Ship, we entered
upon a Consultation what to do at this emergen∣cy,
whether it were not the safest way for us to get
a-shoar, and stay there till the Corsair had quitted
the Road, or for us to go straightways on Foot to
<HI>Tanor,</HI> and let our Vessel take the conveniency of
the Night to escape the Pirate. But there being no
Houses at any reasonable distance from the Shoar,
we did not think fit to put this Project in executi∣on,
but setting the best face we could upon the mat∣ter,
rowed as near the Shoar as we could in the
same manner as we had done before; and thus
with our Arms ready to receive the Pirate, if he
should come to Attack us, we pass'd unmolested be∣twixt
him and the Shoar, and Arrived safely the
same Evening at <HI>Tanor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Tanor.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TAnor</HI> is the principal Town of a petty Kingdom,
which has given it its Name; it is 5 Leagues
distant to the South from <HI>Calicut.</HI> It wants the con∣veniency
of a River, the Ships that are bound to
this place being obliged to ride in the Road where
there is tolerable good riding, but only in the Sum∣mer.
The Inhabitants of the place are <HI>Mahometan</HI>
Merchants, who, most of them are very Rich.
On the very Sea side there are two small Towns
Inhabited by Fisher-Men, whereof those of one
are <HI>Christians,</HI> those of the other <HI>Pagans.</HI> Near the
first of these two you see a small Church standing
<PB N="144" REF="88"/>
in a Church-Yard, where stands a very high Cross.
The King of <HI>Tanor</HI> keeps his Court at about a
League's distance from thence, his <HI>Mahometan</HI> and
<HI>Pagan</HI> Subjects living under the Jurisdiction of a
Governour of his, who has not the least Authority
over the <HI>Christians,</HI> who are under the Government
of him that has the oversight over the abovementi∣oned
Church, which has long since been in the pos∣session
of the Jesuits, who from time to time send
hither their Missionaries, to labour in the Conversi∣on
of these Idolatrous people to the Christian Faith.
He that was there at the time when I passed that
way, was called <HI>Matthias Fernandez,</HI> who having
lived there for these 7 or 8 Years together, is per∣fectly
well versed in the Language of the Country.</P>
<P>Tho' the whole Kingdom of <HI>Tanor</HI> be not above
8 or 10 Leagues long, and as many broad, yet is
their King as Absolute as any in <HI>Malabar,</HI> not being
Tributary to any other. He has always kept a very
strict Alliance with the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and these have
been as careful to maintain a constant good under∣standing
with him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King of <HI>Tanor</HI> is an Enemy to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> The differences which were
then betwixt us and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> being risen to
that pitch, that we expected nothing else but to
come quickly to an open Rupture, and this Prince
having always been a Mortal Enemy of the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
we endeavour'd by all means possible to gain his
good Will, for which purpose we made him some
Presents in the name of the <HI>French East-India</HI> Com∣pany.</P>
<P>All the Territories belonging to the King of <HI>Ta∣nor,</HI>
are extreamly Fertile, the Air is very whol∣some,
there is great plenty of Fish and extraordi∣nary
good Hunting. The ordinary Food of the In∣habitants
is for the most part Fish, unless it be some
persons much advanced in Years, who eat Fowl and
sometimes a Kid, Beef being look'd upon by these
as well as the other <HI>Pagans</HI> as a forbidden Fruit.
After we had dispatched our Business at <HI>Tanor,</HI> we
Travelled by Land to <HI>Calicut,</HI> whither we had sent
our <HI>Almadre</HI> or small Vessel before us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure from Tanor.</HEAD>
<P>WE did not set out till pretty late from <HI>Tanor,</HI>
which was the reason we could not Travel
farther that Night than to <HI>Chali,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chali.</NOTE> two Leagues di∣stant
from <HI>Tanor,</HI> where we lay that Night. This
is a Market-Town belonging to the King of <HI>Samo∣rin,</HI>
where besides the Merchants there live a good
number of <HI>Tives.</HI> It lies on a River capable of
bearing Ships of 100 Tuns Burthen, but is so
pestered with Pirates, that it is not very safe for
Merchant-Men to enter here. We being lodged
at a <HI>Tive</HI>'s House, we had the opportunity of see∣ing
them perform one of these ridiculous Cere∣monies
used among the <HI>Pagans,</HI> for the Recovery
of their Kindred, in case of any dangerous Sick∣ness.</P>
<P>A Nephew of our Host much Beloved by him,
was fallen dangerously ill of a Fever, and in spite
of all the Remedies that were used by his Unkle,
(who had left nothing unattempted which might
conduce to the Recovery of his Health,) was by
the violence of his Distemper reduced to that Con∣dition,
that his Life was despaired of. All other
Remedies having proved ineffectual, he had re∣course
to the Mysterious Superstition of his Reli∣gion,
and having sent for the <HI>Bramans</HI> belonging
to the next Temple, to try their Skill with the
Patient, they sent one of their Number, who began
the Ceremony with crying silence to the Compa∣ny.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="89"/>
After this he ordered a large Wooden Bowl to be
brought to him, which was laid all over the bot∣tom
with Leaves; into this he put some fresh <HI>Co∣coes,</HI>
some dry'd, some <HI>Bananas,</HI> some <HI>Jagre,</HI> or
Sugar of the <HI>Cocoes,</HI> some boil'd Rice, and some
broil'd Fish, besides a good cup full of <HI>Tary,</HI> or
Palm-tree Wine. The <HI>Braman</HI> put in every thing
with his own hand, muttering out certain Words,
and making most extravagant and ridiculous Po∣stures.
Round the great Bowl he stuck many Wax
Candles lighted, and betwixt each of them a stick
of the same thickness tied all round about with Flow∣ers.
Then the <HI>Braman</HI> fell to his Prayers, which
being ended, he called to one of the Standers by,
who gave him one of the lighted Wax Candles,
which he put in his Mouth. This was no sooner
done, but he appeared to be all in a Rapture, ma∣king
most strange Postures and Faces, this being the
very nick of time, when they believe him to be in∣spired,
and look upon what he pronounces, as O∣racles,
whether the Patient be to live or die. How∣ever
it was, this Devil happened to be none of the
most skilful; for he foretold that the young Man
should recover his Health, which proved quite con∣trary,
for he died in a few days after.</P>
<P>We went the next day from <HI>Chali,</HI> and arrived
the day following early at <HI>Calicut,</HI> where we found
the <HI>English</HI> busie in removing after the late inunda∣tion;
we travelled a league beyond it the same day,
where we lodged that Night, and the next follow∣ing
at <HI>Bargara,</HI> from whence we returned the next
day to <HI>Calicut.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Journey to Batiepatan.</HEAD>
<P>HAving received the wellcome News,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English</HI> Ships ar∣rived at <HI>Batiepa∣tan.</HI></NOTE> that the
<HI>English</HI> Ships, which the <HI>English East-India</HI>
Company sends every year to the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI>
to fetch Pepper, were safely arrived at <HI>Batiepatan;</HI>
I resolved with another Friend of mine to go thi∣ther,
to learn if possible some News out of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and from <HI>Suratte;</HI> we entred the River of <HI>Batiepa∣tan</HI>
before Noon, and came up as high as the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
House by that time they were just going to Din∣ner.
The <HI>English</HI> Factory of <HI>Batiepatan,</HI> is above
a League and a half from the Sea-side, built upon
a rising Ground just on the very River-side, which
will not bear any Ships of Burthen. The <HI>English</HI>
Commissary, and the Captains there present, enter∣tained
us very handsomely, so that we staid there
all the rest of the day; our Mariners having in the
mean while refreshed themselves, and fearing if
we staid any longer, we should be hard put to it
with drinking; we parted at Night, and came safely
the next Morning to <HI>Tilcery,</HI> where, in a few days
after, the <HI>English</HI> return'd us the visit.</P>
<P>But as these diversions were but very rare among
us, so I began to be weary of this kind of Life,
which had made me write several times to the Di∣rectors
of our <HI>East-India</HI> Company, to desire them
to remove me from <HI>Tilcery,</HI> being fully resolved to
leave it without their permission, if in a little time
I did not receive a favourable answer.</P>
<P>In the mean while we took another Journey to
<HI>Tanor,</HI> where we heard the news of the death of
<PB N="148" REF="90"/>
the young <HI>Tive,</HI> of whom I spoke before, to have
been cured by the <HI>Braman.</HI> We only stay'd here
for a few days, when having dispatch'd our business,
we return'd to <HI>Tilcery</HI> by Sea.</P>
<P>As it is very dangerous to coast it along the shoar,
by reason of the great number of the Corsairs, that
are watching thereabouts for pray, we put out to
Sea, where they are not so frequent. But scarce
had we sail'd a League, when we were on a sudden
over whelmed with such an infinite number of Fish,
as big as our Mackerel, which threw themselves in∣to
our Vessel, that the diversion we took at it at first
sight, not long after turned into fear of being sunk
by their weight. We were fain to set all hands to
work to throw them out as fast as possibly we could,
which however would have stood us but in little
stead, if we had not avoided the danger, by making
towards the shoar with all speed we could. Having
rid our selves thus of our unwelcome Guests, trou∣blesome
only by their number we put to Sea again
a second time, and arrived at <HI>Calicut</HI> about Mid∣night.</P>
<P>We entertained the next day the <HI>English</HI> with all
their Domesticks, and our selves with some of the
Fish that were come into our Vessel the day before;
besides which, our Ships Crew sold whole Baskets full
of them to the Inhabitants. We did not stay here
above two days, and having sent back our Vessel to
<HI>Tanor,</HI> we travelled back by Land to <HI>Tilcery.</HI></P>

<P>THE Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> returning from <HI>Sirinpatan</HI>
towards the end of <HI>November,</HI> gave us an exact
account of the Danger and Fatigues he had under∣gone
after I had left him upon his Journey, which
had taken him up five and thirty days, though he
had not above thirty Leagues to Travel. Besides
which he had been in danger of being drowned by
the violence of the Currents of those Rivers which
he had been forced to pass, having lost several of
his Company by these Disasters. But the good
success of his Negotiation, having made him a full
amends for the troubles he had suffered, he remem∣bred
the past dangers with a greal deal of Satisfa∣ction.</P>
<P>The Commodities brought from <HI>Sirinpatan</HI> are
the finest Callicoes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties brought from <HI>Sirin∣patan.</HI></NOTE> Sandal Wood, which grows

There is also in that Country, good store of a Na∣tive
Salt Petre, which is bought very cheap and
wants but little refining. The Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI>
shewed us some patterns of these Callicoes, half as
fine again as those of <HI>Suratte</HI> for the same price.</P>
<P>We were busied the remaining part of this year
in buying up of Pepper, to be ready at hand a∣gainst
the arrival of our Vessels, which were ex∣pected
daily to come into our Road; and in the be∣ginning
of <HI>January,</HI> the Ship called the <HI>Providence,</HI>
arrived to take in part of her Cargo in that Com∣modity.
The Captains name was Mr. <HI>Petit,</HI> who
<PB N="150" REF="91"/>
had not above seven <HI>Frenchmen</HI> on Board, the rest
of his Ships Crew being all Mahometans. He in∣form'd
us of the arrival of the Sieur <HI>de Blot,</HI> Dire∣ctor
of the <HI>French</HI> East-India Company in those parts,
and that he had sent his Orders to the Sieur <HI>de la

was not a little out of Humour to find that I had not
been mentioned by him, but as all the Gentlemen
that had any Command here, were my particular
Friends, so I obtain'd without much difficulty their
consent of going in the same Ship with the Sieur <HI>de
Serine,</HI> being resolved not to spend the best part of
my younger days, nor to confine my curiosity to
this remote corner of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de Flacour</HI> was the very person who was
unwilling to lose my Company, and to stay be∣hind
alone; but being convinced of the necessity of
my departure, I prepared my self to go along with
the above mentioned Captain <HI>Petit,</HI> so soon as he
should return from <HI>Tanor</HI> and <HI>Calicut,</HI> whither he
was sailed to take in such Commodities, as we had
bought up before.</P>
<P>In the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One of the Kings Ships arrives.</NOTE> one of the Kings Ships, car∣rying
sixty pieces of Cannon, commanded by Cap∣tain

out of <HI>France</HI> a year before them, having on board
a good Summ to pay the Troops in the service of
the <HI>East-India</HI> Company. They being separated
from one another, some days before by stress of Wea¦ther,
the Captain was at an uncertainty whether
the Pinks were behind or before him, and perceiv∣ing
our White Flag, they came to an Anchor in the
Road, but did not stay longer than four and twenty
hours, during which they were provided with all
manner of refreshments. The King's Ship was
scarce got out of sight, being not above four hours
under Sail, when Captain <HI>de Petit</HI> return'd with his
Ship from <HI>Calicut,</HI> and we were getting every thing
ready to set sail the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="91"/>
The same day towards Evening, we perceived a
small Vessel which was making towards our Road,

Chaloup a Lieutenant belonging to one of the Pinks,
which had been separated from the King's Ship,

kept all Day long out at Sea, but towards Night
constantly approached nearer the Shoar, to take the
advantage of the Wind, which blows from the Shoar
always after Midnight; in three days we came with∣in

<P>With much ado,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are in danger of being lost.</NOTE> we got safely into the Road of
<HI>Mangalor,</HI> by Eight a-Clock at Night, but the Pink
did not come to an Anchor there till the next Morn∣ing;
for fear of sticking upon the Sands, if they
should come in the Night-time, as we did, who
trusting to the skill of our Mariners, who pretend∣ed
to be well acquainted with that port, were in
great danger of being lost; for having put our
selves in the Night into a Chaloup, in order to go
on shoar, we miss'd the Passage, which is the only
way, through which one may safely enter the Ri∣ver.
We expected every moment to have been
split upon the Rocks, which lay hidden just under
the surface of the Water, but at last we had the
good luck to escape and get safely on shoar.</P>

unless at Spring-Tydes. The Town is Situate up∣on
a rising Ground, inhabited by Pagans and Ma∣hometan
Merchants; and near it you see the Fa∣ctory
of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> which they call in their
Language <HI>Feituria.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly all the Forts which are near the ports
of the Kingdom of <HI>Canara,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Portu∣gueses,</HI>
but the <HI>Canarins</HI> as well as most of the other
<HI>Indian</HI> People, thinking their Pride insupportable,
took their opportunity, whilst they were engaged
in a War with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to drive them from
thence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Portu∣gueses</HI> chased out of Canara▪</NOTE> who knew the importance of
these places, after the Peace concluded betwixt
them and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> have left no stone unturned to
regain from the <HI>Canarins</HI> these places; for which pur∣pose
they sent a Fleet on that coast, which ruin'd
the commerce of that Kingdom to that degree, that
it was reduced to the utmost misery, which obliged
the King of <HI>Canara</HI> to sue for Peace to <HI>Lewis de Men∣doza,</HI>
then Vice-roy of the <HI>Indies</HI> for the King of
<HI>Portugal,</HI> offering the restitution of the two most
considerable Forts of <HI>Mangalor</HI> and <HI>Barcalor.</HI> The
<HI>Portugueses</HI> accepted the conditions, but thinking it
two chargeable to entertain two strong Garrisons
at such a distance, they were contented with erect∣ing
new Factories in these places, reserving to them∣selves
half the profits of all the customs paid from
goods, exported or imported in these two Ports.</P>
<P>The subjects of the King of <HI>Canara,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King∣dom of Ca∣nara.</NOTE> are for the
most part <HI>Pagans,</HI> the rest are <HI>Mahometans:</HI> They
don't follow the Laws and Customs of the <HI>Malabars,</HI>
especially in what relates to the differences and de∣grees
of their Tribes; they are seldom without be∣ing
engaged in a War with the Neighbouring <HI>Ma∣labars,</HI>
where the <HI>Canarins</HI> commonly are worsted.
They live in most respects according to the Laws
and Customs of the Pagan <HI>Indians,</HI> who are subjects
of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> the King of <HI>Canara</HI> being his
Tributary.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="93"/>
The <HI>Canarins</HI> are of a Tawny Complexion,
and middle sized, wear their Hair long, and Cloath
themselves not unlike the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Suratte.</HI> They
are most of them very good Soldiers, and most
expert in Mining, besides that they don't Fight
so disorderly as the <HI>Malabars,</HI> but they are not
so brave, being more addicted to Commerce, for
which reason, you meet with them in all parts of
the <HI>Indies,</HI> to vend their Commodities.</P>
<P>The manner of Solemnizing their Feasts being
the most extravagant in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Feasts.</NOTE> deserves to
be taken notice of here: At these Solemnities they
carry their Idols in Triumph, being placed in a
Wagon, adorned on all sides with Flowers. But
what is the most surprizing, is, that there are se∣veral
sharp crooked Iron hooks fastned to the
Wheels upon which these poor Superstitious wret∣ches
throw themselves, and thus to signalize their
Zeal, cause themselves to be turn'd round with the
Wheels till they are cut to pieces.</P>
<P>Others lie sprawling upon the Ground, on pur∣pose
to be crushed to pieces by the force of the
Wheels and the weight of the Waggon, which pas∣ses
over their Bodies. All which is done out of a
vain belief they have that by thus Sacrificing them∣selves
for the Honour of their Gods, they shall en∣joy
the bliss of Immortality hereafter.</P>
<P>The manner of Executing their Criminals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they Execute their Cri∣minals.</NOTE> as it is
very Cruel, so it ought not to be pass'd by in si∣lence:
They strip them quite Naked, and thus tied
Hand and Feet, expose them upon the Sands to the
Sun, where they die a most miserable and ling∣ring
Death, being consumed by degrees by the vi∣olent
heat of the Sun and the Flies. And for fear
that the place where they are laid should grow
cool and afford them some intervals in their Mise∣ry,
they take care to remove them frequently, till
such time they expire amidst the most cruel Tor∣ments.</P>
<P>The Air of <HI>Canara</HI> is very pure and sufficiently
pleasant, and the Country tho' not of a very great
<PB N="155" REF="93"/>
extent, extreamly Fertile, this part of the Country
furnishing all <HI>Europe</HI> with Rice, besides which there
are great quantities of Rice exported from hence to
<HI>Achem, Bantam, Socotora, Moqua, Mascate, Balsora, Mosa∣mbique,
Bombase,</HI> and to several other places in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure from Mangalor.</HEAD>
<P>WE set Sail from <HI>Mangalor</HI> the next day after
the Pink, Commanded by the Sieur the
<HI>Barbot,</HI> and after we had Sailed 24 Hours, passed
in sight of <HI>Barcalor,</HI> but did not enter the Port,
being resolved to come to an Anchor that Night,
if possible, in the Road of <HI>Mirscou.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after our Arrival, we went to pay
our respects to the Governour <HI>Cojabdalle,</HI> of whom
we have had occasion to speak before, who, since
we saw him last, had been involved in great Trou∣bles.
He had been accused of Extorsions, and o∣ther
Malversation, whereupon, having been Sum∣mon'd
to appear before his Prince, he was Con∣demn'd
to a Prison, where he suffered great hard∣ships
for some time; but having at last found
means to justifie himself against these Aspersions,
the King his Master had restored him to all his
Offices and Dignities he enjoyed before his Dis∣grace.
The discontent occasioned by his late Trou∣bles
might easily have been read in his Face, when
we saw him, notwithstanding which, he received
us with a great deal of Civility; telling us, that
it was a great dissatisfaction to him to see our <HI>East-India</HI>
Company to Abandon the place where he
was Governour, and to see them transport it to
any Port where he had no Authority, and conse∣quently
<PB N="156" REF="94"/>
was not in a Capacity to serve them. We
return'd him Thanks for his Kindness, with assu∣rance,
that we were not without hopes of return∣ing
thither in a little time, and to settle the con∣cerns
of the Company upon a more solid founda∣tion
than before, under his Government; at which,
he was extreamly pleased, and writ a Letter to
the Directors of our Company at <HI>Suratte,</HI> to In∣vite
them to <HI>Mirscou,</HI> with great promises of all
the assistance he was able to give them.</P>
<P>After two days stay, we set Sail again from
<HI>Mirscou,</HI> and the next Morning early discovered a
Squadron of 13 Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They meet with Mon∣sieur <HI>de la Haye.</HI></NOTE> which proved to be the
<HI>French</HI> Squadron, Commanded by Monsieur <HI>de la
Haye,</HI> of which we have made mention before.
The Admiral with another Ship coming up with
us, informed our Captain that the Sieur <HI>de Caron,</HI>
one of the Directors of our Company in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
was on Board one of these Vessels, he went in a
<HI>Chaloup</HI> to pay him a Visit, and after his return, told
us, that the <HI>French</HI> Squadron was bound to the South,
and that there was a discourse among them of
creating Factories for the <HI>French East-India</HI> Com∣pany,
in the Isle of <HI>Ceylon;</HI> so we left them, Steer∣ing
our Course towards <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>We came the same Night within sight of the
Forts, which are at the Entrance of the River of
<HI>Goa,</HI> but being not very well acquainted with the
Coast, which is accounted very dangerous, we did
not come to an Anchor till early in the Morning
the next day, being the last of <HI>January.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Arrival at Goa.</HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>Goa</HI> is Situate under the 15th De∣gree
of North Latitude; it formerly belong∣ed
to the King of <HI>Visapour,</HI> but is now in the pos∣session
of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>The River of <HI>Goa</HI> is one of the finest in the
whole World, no Ships of what Burthen soever,
but may go up without the least danger to the
City.</P>
<P>This River is as it were divided into two Bran∣ches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Goa.</HI> Isle of <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE>
by an Isle called <HI>Goa,</HI> which has given its
Name to the City, which is Built upon it. The
Isle is of an Oval Figure, about 7 Leagues in
Circuit; the most narrow point of the Island ex∣tends
it self into the open Sea; Parallel with the
two Capes of the Continent, which makes a dou∣ble
Harbour equally Commodious for Vessels on
either side.</P>
<P>The Southern point of the Continent is called
by the <HI>Portugueses, Cabo de Rama,</HI> where they have
a strong Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fort</HI> Mour∣mougon.</NOTE> called Fort <HI>de Mourmougon,</HI> which
being always provided with a good Garrison, and
Artillery proportionable to defend the Entrance of
the Harbour on that side.</P>
<P>On the utmost point of the Island, which sepa∣rates
the two Harbours, there is another Fort which
has taken its Name from a Monastery of the <HI>Re∣collects,</HI>
(a sort of <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friars,) who have De∣dicated
their Church to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and is
by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> called <HI>Nossa Senhora Docaba.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="95"/>
On the Northern Cape of the Continent lies the
Fort of <HI>Agoada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort of <HI>A∣goada.</HI></NOTE> so called, because there is most ex∣cellent
Water thereabouts, which furnishes all
Ships that come into that Port.</P>
<P>The Fort of <HI>Agoada</HI> is the most considerable, both
for its strength and bigness, this being the most
convenient Harbour of the two for Anchorage,
where Ships cannot pass the Chanel but within
Cannon Shot of the Fort, as they are either go∣ing
or coming from <HI>Goa.</HI> The Governours of <HI>Goa</HI>
have here a House so Magnificently Built that it
would pass for a fine Palace, even in <HI>Europe,</HI> where
they divert themselves frequently.</P>
<P>About 3 Leagues from the City there are seve∣ral
other lesser Forts, where they keep no Garri∣sons,
and on both sides of the Shoar you see abun∣dance
of fine Country Houses, belonging to the In∣habitants
of <HI>Goa,</HI> and several very large and stately
Villages, by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> called <HI>Aldea's;</HI> the
vast number of Gardens which are seen near the
City being the whole Year round, stored with se∣veral
sorts of Fruits, Flowers, and Leaves, afford
a very pleasant prospect.</P>
<P>There is about a League from the City of <HI>Goa,</HI>
a very large Village or <HI>Aldea</HI> called <HI>Pangim,</HI> sur∣passing
in Beauty many goodly Cities, where per∣sons
of Quality have their Palaces, to shelter them∣selves
here against the heats of the Sun; and the
Gardens being in all respects suitable to the Gran∣deur
of the edifices, appear very surprizing to
Strangers.</P>
<P>Half way betwixt <HI>Pangim</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> is the Church
called <HI>Notra Senhora de Ribaudar,</HI> concerning which
the <HI>Portugueses</HI> relate the following History.</P>
<P>A <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> being come as
far as the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope,</HI> was there surprized
towards Night by a most violent Tempest, so that
the Mariners expected nothing but Death every
Moment, but the next Morning by break of day,
they found their Ship riding at Anchor in the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Goa,</HI> just opposite to the place, where in
<PB N="159" REF="95"/>
Memory of the Miracle, the abovementioned Church
is Built on the River side. To perpetuate the Me∣mory
of so surprizing an Adventure there is a Ship
Painted upon the Church-Door, and upon the ve∣ry
Banks of the River are to be seen 2 large Cros∣ses
made of Stone, which they say are of the same
length with the Ship, that performed this Mira∣culous
Voyage, which without question was the
nimblest Sailer that ever was known, since she
Sailed 2000 Leagues in one Night.</P>
<P><HI>La Casa de Polvera,</HI> or the <HI>Powder-House,</HI> is with∣out
the City, where they keep their Criminals Con∣demned
to Imprisonment; which is also the Prison
of all such <HI>Malabar</HI> Pirates as they take at Sea.</P>
<P>All such Vessels as come to <HI>Goa,</HI> betwixt the
20th day of <HI>May</HI> and the last of <HI>August</HI> are ob∣liged
to enter the River by the Southern Channel,
where lies the Fort of <HI>Mourmougon,</HI> no body being
permitted to pass during that time, through the
North Channels, near the Fort of <HI>Agoada,</HI> which
however is open for all the rest of the Year.</P>
<P>Those Ships that Arrive at <HI>Goa</HI> in a proper Sea∣son
of what bulk soever, may without the least
danger go up as high as the City, and ride at ano∣ther
just before the Vice-Roy's Palace.</P>

<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="160" REF="96"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the City of Goa.</HEAD>
<P>THIS City was once one of the most flourish∣ing
of all the <HI>Indies,</HI> but has lost much of its
former greatness in the last War betwixt the <HI>Por∣tugueses</HI>
and <HI>Dutch.</HI> It is the most considerable the
<HI>Portugueses</HI> are Masters of in all the Eastern parts;
being the Residence of their Vice-Roy of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
and where they keep their highest Court of Justice.
One half of it is Built upon an ascent upon the
very Bank of the River, the other part lies in a
bottom, where the heat is very excessive, which
makes the Inhabitants retire into the circumjacent
Country Villages, during the violence of the Hot
Season.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the City of <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> For the rest, the Market-places and Streets
of <HI>Goa</HI> are very fine; it is surrounded with a Wall,
but of little Strength, the Avenues tending to the
City being so well guarded, as not to stand in
need of any other Works to defend it against any
Attempts of an Enemy. The High Court of Ju∣stice
is kept in the Vice-Roy's Palace; this Court
is by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> called <HI>Ralacam;</HI> and it is to
this Court that all the other Subaltern Courts of
<HI>Goa,</HI> and other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> under the Ju∣risdiction
of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> may bring their Ap∣peals.</P>
<P>The Houses of <HI>Goa</HI> are generally very hand∣somely
Built,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses of <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> but somewhat Dark at their Win∣dows,
being made out of certain Oister-shells very
thin cut.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is Dedicated to St. <HI>Catharine,</HI> and
is a vast Structure, but rudely Built. Next to it
<PB N="161" REF="96"/>
is the Arch-Bishop's Palace, and the Bishops, or
rather the great Vicar's House, who is not inferi∣our
to any Bishop, and is called by the <HI>Portugueses
Bispo d'Anelt.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from this you see the Prison, called <HI>Ati∣ouvar,</HI>
where no body is Committed but upon the
account of Ecclesiastical concerns.</P>
<P>Just opposite to the Cathedral in a great Square,
stands that Famous House, whose very Name
makes many thousands Tremble in those parts;
this is the Court of Inquisition, called by the <HI>Por∣tugueses,
Santa Casaou Casa d'o santo Officio.</HI></P>
<P>There is also a Nunnery in the City, where the
Nuns live with a great deal of Austerity, without
making use of the same liberty as they do in <HI>Por∣tugal;</HI>
and it is to their Capacity and that of the
holy Inquisition, the <HI>Portugueses</HI> own themselves
chiefly indebted for the great affluence of their
Fortunes, and other conveniencies they enjoy at
<HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>Besides their Parish Churches, there are many Mo∣nasteries
of several Orders. The <HI>Jesuits</HI> have here
3 fine Churches, in one of which, the Corps of
St. <HI>Francis Xavier</HI> is deposited; besides which, they
have 3 most Magnificent Houses, each of them be∣ing
fit for the reception of a King, with abundance
of the best Lands round the City, from whence
they draw a vast yearly Revenue. All their Chur∣ches
are very finely Built, but the Hospital exceeds
the rest.</P>
<P>The Church of the <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otins,</HI> tho' not the most
Magnificent, yet is the neatest and most regular
of all the Churches in <HI>Goa;</HI> this Church is De∣dicated
to <HI>Nossa Sen Hora de Divina Providentia.</HI></P>
<P>The Church called <HI>de Misericordia,</HI> has nothing
remarkable beyond the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chari∣table Socie∣ty.</NOTE> but the Society for
whose sake this Church has been erected and has
derived its Name, deserves particularly to be taken
notice of here.</P>
<P>This Society is by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> called <HI>Irman∣dal
de Misericordia,</HI> and its Members <HI>Irmaous da
<PB N="162" REF="97"/>
Misericordia;</HI> the chief Citizens of <HI>Goa,</HI> and per∣sons
of the best Quality, not excepting the Vice-Roy
himself, are Ambitious of being Members of
this Fraternity, who Celebrate two great Feasts
every Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holy-Thursday,</HI> because on that day our Sa∣viour
gave to the World the most evident proof
of his Humiliation, when he wash'd the Feet of
the Apostles; and the other is Celebrated on the
day when the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> came to visit her Cousin;
this last is performed with more Solemnity than
the first, and as they go in Procession, they wear
a kind of Black Surplice.</P>
<P>The next day after the last Feast, the whole
Society meets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officers be∣longing to this Society.</NOTE> when they choose their Officers.
First they have a Prior, whom they call <HI>Prouve∣dor;</HI>
formerly none but Noblemen were chosen
to that Dignity, but of late the Rich Merchants
are chosen as well as the Noblemen. All the Con∣tributions
here are made for the Advantage of the
Poor, and there is scarce a <HI>Prouvedor,</HI> who at the
Years end does not contribute 20000 Livres of his
own. Besides the <HI>Prouvedor,</HI> there is a Treasurer
and Steward; a <HI>Prouvedor</HI> or Overseer of the Pri∣soners,
all which, are chosen out of the Members
of this Society. The Treasurer disposes of the
Alms among the Poor, as the Overseer of the Pri∣soners
sollicites their Business in causes both Civil
and Criminal, and often procures their Pardon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prouvedor</HI> General's Office is to manage the
Business of the whole Society, to assist underhand
Widows, Orphans, and all others that are in a low
Condition. The Members of this Society are ob∣liged
to visit the Poor and Sick, as also the Priso∣ners,
to Bury the Dead, to assist Criminals when
they go to Execution, and to give them what
Comfort they can even to the last Gasp, and to
cause Masses to be said for them after they have
suffered the Law. They choose every Year new
Officers, by which means, every one of the Mem∣bers
is in a probability of bearing his share, and
<PB N="163" REF="97"/>
tho' all these Offices are chargeable, there's very
few but what are very eager after them.</P>
<P>Charity is the whole foundation of this Noble
and most Glorious Society; and there is scarce a
City, no not a Burrough of note, under the Juris∣diction
of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> but what has a Church
Dedicated to the same use, with some Revenues to
be applied to the same purpose with this Society,
tho' for the rest they have no dependance on one ano∣ther.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Inhabitants of Goa.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>Goa</HI> may conveniently be
divided into several kinds: The first are the
true <HI>Portugueses,</HI> whom they call <HI>Reinots;</HI> the se∣cond
are the <HI>Mestices,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of In∣habitants in <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> begotten betwixt a <HI>Portuguese</HI>
and an <HI>Indian</HI> Woman, or a <HI>Negroe,</HI> the last of
these too much exceed the others in number. There
are besides this abundance of <HI>Indians,</HI> who having
Abandon'd their Superstitious Idolatry, are turn'd
<HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> The Slaves they call <HI>Cafres,</HI>
who are most <HI>Indians.</HI> There are also at <HI>Goa</HI> some
<HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Banyans,</HI> who are tolerated by the
<HI>Portugueses,</HI> by reason of the advantages they re∣ceive
from them, by way of Commerce. They
enjoy the same Freedom with the rest, but are
not permitted to make publick profession of their
Religion, which if they do, they are put under
the Inquisition, and are treated like Christian Apo∣states.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality are carried in <HI>Palanquins</HI> by
their Slaves, and seldom are seen on Horse-back,
<PB N="164" REF="98"/>
unless it be upon extraordinary occasions, as to
Conduct the Vice-Roy into the Country, or to as∣sist
at the running of the Ring, or Bull-fight∣ings.</P>
<P>The Slaves at <HI>Goa</HI> not wanting conveniency to
Desert their Masters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves at <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> and to shelter themselves in
the Adjacent Provinces, where they are out of
their reach, makes them not to be treated so harsh∣ly
as in some other parts, which makes these <HI>Bar∣barians</HI>
very unruly and insolent. They frequent∣ly
Rob on the High-ways, and tho' they are not
permitted to wear any thing else about them but
a Cane, yet they commonly knock Passengers on
the Head before they Rob them.</P>
<P>A certain Gentleman coming one day alone
from his Country-House, near <HI>Goa,</HI> was set upon
by one of these <HI>Negroe</HI> Slaves, who threatned to
knock his Brains out if he did not immediately sur∣render
his Money and Cloaths. The <HI>Portuguese</HI>
had a Sword and Dagger by his side, but the other
having surprized him unawares, and holding up
his Cane ready to strike if he made the least moti∣on,
he found himself not in a condition to put
himself in a posture of defence, without most im∣minent
danger of being killed. And finding no
other remedy than to surrender, he cunningly, but
in a careless manner, let drop some of his Money,
and whilst the Slave was busie in taking it up,
took this opportunity to draw his Dagger where∣with
he dispatched him presently.</P>
<P>It would be superfluous to enlarge here upon the
Manners and Customs of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> they be∣ing
too well known in these parts to deserve a parti∣cular
Description. There are very few but what are
sufficiently sensible that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> in general
have these three Qualities belonging to them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genius of the <HI>Portu∣gueses.</HI></NOTE> To
be Zealous to the highest degree of Superstition; to
be Amorous to a degree of Madness, and Jealous
beyond all reason. Neither will it appear strange,
if the Ladies of <HI>Goa</HI> are as tractable and obliging
to handsome Men, as those of <HI>Lisbon.</HI> 'Tis true,
<PB N="165" REF="98"/>
they are watch'd as narrowly as is possible to be
done, but they seldom want wit to deceive their
Keepers, when they are resolved to taste of the for∣bidden
Fruit; and they are the most revengeful
Creatures in the World, if they happen to be dis∣appointed
in their Expectation.</P>
<P>I cannot but remember a certain Amorous In∣trigue
which hapned at the same time when I was
at <HI>Goa.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ladies of <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> It seems a Lady of this City, had cast her
Eyes upon a certain young <HI>English</HI> Gentleman,
who was at that time at <HI>Goa,</HI> about some Business
concerning their <HI>East-India</HI> Company. Her Heart
being easily susceptible of Love, the very first sight
of this Stranger, had made so lively an impression
upon it, that she could not rest satisfied till she had
sent one of her Female Slaves, (no novice in the
procuring Trade,) to desire the <HI>English</HI> Man to
give her a visit; the Slave sufficiently acquitted her
self of her Charge, telling the Young Gentleman,
that he had the best opportunity in the World,
of taking his Satisfaction, her Lady's Husband be∣ing
abroad, so that the <HI>English</HI> Man overcome by
her intreaties and perswasions, promised to come
at the appointed time, at which she being over∣joyed
returned to her Mistress to bring her the
welcome News that her Gallant would certainly
be with her according to her appointment.</P>
<P>The Lady being one of those that cannot bear
delays without much impatience, made the poor
Slave stand Sentry two Hours before the appoin∣ted
time, to receive her Lover, and Conduct him
to her Apartment. But whether it was that the
<HI>English</HI> Man dreading the Jealousie of the <HI>Portu∣gueses,</HI>
did not think it worth his while to venture
his Life for a chance bit, or that some other rea∣son
hindred him, he did not make his personal ap∣pearance,
according to his promise; so that the
poor Slave after she had kept her post till Mid∣night,
return'd disconsolate to her Mistress, who
being put beyond all Patience, by reason of her
disappointment, revenged her self upon the Slave,
<PB N="166" REF="99"/>
whose Back paid for all; and she would certain∣ly
have felt the most direful effects of her fury,
if she had not promised she would go the next
Morning to find out the <HI>English</HI> Man, to upbraid
him with the breach of his Word, and not to
leave him till she had engaged him to comply with
her desires.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negroe</HI> Slave as it happened had the good
Fortune to meet with the <HI>English</HI> Man, unto whom,
she related in a most ample manner how she had
been treated by her Mistress, occasioned by his
neglect or breach of Word, most earnestly intrea∣ting
him only to afford her Mistress the favour of
one visit, without which, she would be in danger
of being torn to pieces by this passionate body.
He promised, out of Complaisance, to come
very shortly to pay her a visit, but perform'd his
promise no better than the first time, being obliged
to leave <HI>Goa</HI> in a few days after.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> and <HI>Mestices</HI> wear their Cloaths
in the <HI>Indies</HI> after the same manner as they do in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> except that they use no Stockings, their
Breeches reaching down to their Ankles, the bet∣ter
to defend themselves against the burning Heat
of that Climate.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Goa</HI> Ladies Dress is different from that
of the Ladies of <HI>Lisbon.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Dress.</NOTE> They wear a kind of
half Smocks, of the clearest and finest Muslin,
which serves more to keep them from being incom∣moded
by the Flies, than to cover their Bodies.
They don't reach below the Waste, and their
Sleeves come quite down to their Wrists. Their
Petticoats are of fine White Callicoe, scarce co∣vering
half their Legs, over which, when they go
abroad, they wear according to their Quality, some
Silk pieces of Stuff, which they wind twice round
them, and reaches down below their Ankles;
they don't wear Stockings no more than the Men,
and instead of Shooes make use of Slippers. They

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Concerning our stay at Goa.</HEAD>
<P>THere are in the River of <HI>Goa</HI> many very pleasant
and most fruitful small Islands, and on the Shoar
of the Continent, (being under the Jurisdiction of
the <HI>Sevagi,</HI> whom we have mentioned before,) a
most curious Fountain surrounded on all sides
with Trees, whither the Ladies of <HI>Goa</HI> go in gilt
Boats to divert themselves in the cool of the E∣vening.</P>
<P>The first thing we did after our Arrival at <HI>Goa,</HI>
was to visit Father <HI>Cornelius de St. Cyprian,</HI> Prior of
the discalceated <HI>Carmelites,</HI> who being our Coun∣try-Man
shewed us all the Respect and Civility
in the World; the day after we went to see Mr.
<HI>Martin</HI> a rich <HI>French</HI> Merchant, with whom we
stay'd three days; and who among other diversions,
shew'd us the Fountain I spake of before, where
the Ladies of <HI>Goa</HI> pass their Evenings; as we came
<PB N="168" REF="100"/>
thither we found the places round about it taken
up with several Companies of the fair Sex, so
that we were obliged to follow the custom of the
Country, and out of respect to the Ladies to re∣main
at some distance till they were gone.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> had caused above 20 of the <HI>Indian</HI>
Women Dancers to be conducted thither, who
shew'd their Activity by the light of several Tor∣ches,
and diverted us to our no small satisfaction
a great part of the Night; several of them being
very handsome and extraordinary well shap'd,
some of our Company entred with them in close
Conversation, and Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> having thus enter∣tain'd
us very handsomely, we took our Leave of
him, and spent the next day in setling our Business
in order to our Departure from <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Departure from Goa.</HEAD>
<P>THE Wind being not very favourable to us
as we Sailed out of the Harbour of <HI>Goa,</HI> we
could scarce reach that day within sight of <HI>Beta∣geurta,</HI>
a place Situate about 8 Leagues to the
North of <HI>Goa,</HI> and under the jurisdiction of the
Prince <HI>Sevagi;</HI> our intention was to have touch'd
at <HI>Rajapour,</HI> but not being able to go thither with∣out
much loss of time, we were obliged to go a∣shoar
at <HI>Achara,</HI> a place likewise belonging to the
Prince <HI>Sevagi,</HI> to take in fresh Provisions.</P>
<P>But as we were within a League of the Shoar, we
discovered 6 stout Vessels, which we believing to
belong to the Port of <HI>Achara,</HI> the Sieurs <HI>Petit, de la
Serine,</HI> and my self went with our <HI>Chaloup</HI> Man∣ned
<PB N="169" REF="100"/>
only with 7 <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and an Interpreter,
to take a full view of them; but scarce were we
come within Cannon Shot, when we perceived
them to be 6 <HI>Malabar</HI> Corsairs, who could have no
less than 1500 Men on Board.</P>
<P>Our Sea-Men being all <HI>Mahometans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are in danger of being taken by the <HI>Cor∣sairs.</HI></NOTE> had less
reason to be frighted at the danger that threatned
us than we, who being <HI>Christians,</HI> could not expect
the least Mercy from these <HI>Barbarians,</HI> notwith∣standing
which, they would have leap'd overboard
to save themselves with Swiming, if we had not
forced them with our Swords in hand to row to
the Shoar, this being the only means to escape the
danger into which we had thrown our selves by
our own imprudence and foolhardiness. The Sea-Men
seeing us so resolute ply'd their Oars so wa∣rily
that in a very small time they brought us
without the reach of their Cannon, so that we got
safely a-shoar, without having received the least
damage.</P>
<P>No sooner were we got a-shoar, but we were
informed that the same Corsairs had just before ta∣ken
a Hoy belonging to the <HI>French East-India</HI> Com∣pany,
valued at 2000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, which they ha∣ving
sold to the Governour of <HI>Achara,</HI> we saw the
Vessel lying afterwards in the River.</P>
<P>Tho' the Prince <HI>Sevagi,</HI> the Lord of this Port,
was absolutely in our Interest, yet all our Sea-Men
being <HI>Mahometans,</HI> except only three <HI>French</HI> Men,
we were very uneasie about our Ship, for fear it
should fall into the Hands of these Corsairs. Mr.
<HI>Petit</HI> the Captain had more reason to be concerned
than all the rest, he having left his Ship to go a∣shoar
in a place where he had no concerns on the
account of the Company; and to add to our af∣fliction,
the Wind being quite contrary, we could
not get back again to the Ship.</P>
<P>In this extremity, the Captain took a resolution
suitable to the emergency of our Affairs, which did
not admit of any delay; for which reason he got
into a small <HI>Canoe,</HI> or Fisher-Boat, and leaving
<PB N="170" REF="101"/>
us a shoar, was by two Fishermen happily con∣ducted
to his Ship.</P>
<P>We had no sooner received this well-come news,
but we found means to insinuate into those that li∣ved
near the Sea-side, that we were come hither on
purpose to ransom the Vessel, these Corsairs had ta∣ken
before; that we had sent our Captain on board
to attack these Pirates, and that we having five
and twenty Guns ready mounted, and 150 men on
Board, did not question but to give shortly a very
good account of them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Rhodomontado</HI> succeeded beyond expectati∣on;
for some of the Corsairs having been informed
of what we had related to the inhabitants, and seeing
our Ship to be in a readiness to set sail, they were
so frightned thereat, that they set up all the sail
they could, and making the best of their way to∣wards
the South, left a free passage for our Ship to
enter the port of <HI>Achara.</HI></P>
<P>After we had dispatch'd our business in this place,
we set sail from thence with a fair and fresh gale,
which brought us the same day to the Entrance
of the River of <HI>Rajapour,</HI> of which I will say no
more here, having had occasion to speak of it be∣fore.</P>
<P>We set sail again the next day, and were scarce a
League from the shoar, when to the North of us
we discovered a Vessel, with the white Flag; she
proved to be the <HI>Vulture,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French</HI>
East-India Company, being ordered in her return
to <HI>France,</HI> to touch at <HI>Bantam,</HI> whither she was to
carry my Lord Bishop of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> who was going
to <HI>Siam;</HI> but was, much against his Will, detained
by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Philippin</HI> Islands, and from
thence conducted into <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence he tra∣velled
through <HI>Italy</HI> into <HI>France;</HI> as may be seen in
the Relation Printed by order of the Fathers Missi∣onaries.</P>
<P>We all went to pay our respect to this Prelate,
and on St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s day heard Mass on board of
him. The Winds proving very contrary, all the
<PB N="171" REF="101"/>
rest of our Yoyage to <HI>Suratte,</HI> which is not above four∣score
Leagues from <HI>Rajapour,</HI> we were above a
month before we reached that Port, where we ar∣rived
the <HI>20th.</HI> day of <HI>March.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The arrival of the Ship called the Holy
Ghost.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day after our arrival in the Road of
<HI>Suratte,</HI> we received orders to enter the Port
of <HI>Sovaly;</HI> and I having no occasion to stay on board,
went a shoar and paid my respects to our Directors,
the Sieurs <HI>de Blot,</HI> and <HI>Baron.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the Ship called the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> burthen
600 Tuns, commanded by Captain <HI>le Rokd,</HI> came
to an Anchor in the Road of <HI>Suratte;</HI> she had on
board the Sieur <HI>de Goeron,</HI> Director General of the
<HI>French</HI> East-India Company, and his Son, and had
been near nine Months in her passage from <HI>France,</HI>
having been droven by tempestuous Weather a∣mong
the <HI>Maldive</HI> Islands, from whence few Ships
escape.</P>
<P>The Scurvy was got so desperately among the
whole Ships Crew, that they had scarce hands e∣nough
left to manage the Sails. So soon as the Di∣rectors
were advertised of her arrival, they furnish∣ed
her with skillful Pilates, which conducted her
into the Port of <HI>Sovaly.</HI> The sick Mariners being
brought on shoar, were committed to my care, and
what with the help of the Land-Air, and other pro∣per
Remedies, very few of them but what recover∣ed
in a little time.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="102"/>
Orders being come in the mean while from the
Directors, to get every thing in readiness for her
Voyage to <HI>Bantam,</HI> as also for the <HI>Parl,</HI> which be∣ing
a Ship of less Burthen, and loaden with Wheat
and Soap, did set sail on the beginning of <HI>May,</HI>
and the Ship called the St. <HI>Francis,</HI> being sent before
in <HI>April</HI> to the <HI>Persian</HI> Coast, I had orders sent me,
to get my self in readiness to go in the Ship the
<HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> We were just ready to set sail, ex∣pecting
only our last dispatches, when our Ship,
notwithstanding she was but lately built, sprung a
leak, and drew abundance of Water, so that she
was forc'd to be unloaden, and being judged unfit
for so great a Voyage, all her Cannon was taken
out, and ordered to be laid up in order to be re∣fitted,
but as she was entring the River, she struck
upon the Sands, and was staved to pieces in less
than four and twenty Hours.</P>
<P>The loss of so fine a Ship put us all out of hu∣mour,
and the Directors being willing to save some
of her Rigging, several were imployed for that pur∣pose,
but to no effect, some of them being drown∣ed
in the attempt.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Death of Mr. Blot.</HEAD>
<P>I Staid as long as the rainy Season lasted at <HI>Surat∣te,</HI>
where there happened at that time some
differences betwixt the Directors, which however
did not hinder us from taking our pleasure our
selves, as well as we could; but it was not long be∣fore
our Jollity was turn'd into Grief, by the sudden
death of the Sieur <HI>de Blot,</HI> one of the most conside∣rable
Persons of our Nation in those parts, who be∣ing
seized with a violent Fever, died after nine
days sickness.</P>
<P>According to the custom of the <HI>Europeans</HI> in the
<HI>Indies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. de <HI>Blot</HI>'s Fu∣neral.</NOTE> we invited all the chief Men of the <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> to the Funeral, who appeared there with
all their attendance, as did also abundance of other
Merchants, both <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch</HI> there present were in Mourning,
some on Horse-back, some in <HI>Palanquins,</HI> who ac∣companied
the Corps, which was carried in a
Mourning Coach to the Church-Yard, belonging
to the <HI>French,</HI> which was at a Miles distance from
the City.</P>
<P>The Rains being more violent than usual this
Winter Season, were followed by most terrible in∣undations,
which caused the Rivers to swell to an
extraordinary degree, so that abundance of Ships
were forced from their Anchors by the violence of
the Current, some of them run a Ground, others
were staved to pieces. A Ship belonging to the
Great Mogul was forced with only one Man in her
out of the River, and was never heard of since:
Another Ship of 1800 Tuns belonging to the
<PB N="174" REF="103"/>
same Prince, was carried by the violence of the Wa∣ters
so far upon the Land, that after the Waters
were: sunk, she was found a League from the River
side.</P>
<P>Much about the same time we received intelli∣gence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. de la <HI>Haye</HI> makes a descent at St. <HI>Tho∣mas.</HI></NOTE>
That the Sieur <HI>de la Haye</HI> had touch'd in
the Isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> in order to establish a <HI>French</HI> Fa∣ctory
there; but having been disappointed in his
design, he was sailed from thence to St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in
the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> to furnish himself with ne∣cessary
Provisions; but some of his Men who were
sent on shoar for that purpose, having been very ill
treated by the Inhabitants, he had landed his Forces
and taken their Capital City, which he de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended
with great Bravery against all the <HI>Indian</HI> Forces
thereabouts, that he laid Seige to the place. This
surprising News would scarce have found credit a∣mong
us, if it had not been confirmed by several
Letters.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> the Sieur <HI>Fer∣manel</HI>
who was Captain of the Ship called the St.
<HI>James,</HI> received orders to get every thing ready for his
departure, and I being commanded to go on board
the same Ship, we departed from <HI>Suratte</HI> without
knowing whither we were bound, our orders being
sealed up and not to be opened till we were twenty
Leagues at Sea of off <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>It was our Opinion, that the <HI>French</HI> Directors
having received secret intelligence, that we were
come to a rupture with <HI>Holland,</HI> and knowing our
selves much inferiour in strength to them in the
<HI>Indies,</HI> they were afraid; for the Ship called the St.
<HI>Francis,</HI> which being of no small consequence to the
Company they had ordered our Ship, to convoy
her in her return to <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>The orders being opened at the appointed place,
we found our selves to have been pretty near the
Mark, for we were commanded to stop and search
all such Ships as we met, that were weaker than
we, and to take all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships we could.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="103"/>
The Winds proved very changeable, notwith∣standing
which, our Voyage proved pretty success∣ful.
We came within sight of the Cape of <HI>Rasal∣gate,</HI>
situate on the South-side of the entrance into
the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph, and after we had doubled the
Cape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Mascate.</HI></NOTE> we sailed all along the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coast, and
passed in sight of the City of <HI>Mascate,</HI> very consi∣derable
for its most advantageous Situation.</P>
<P>Here it was that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> had formerly a
strong Fort, which being judged impregnable,
made them Masters of the whole <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph;
this so advantageous place the <HI>Portugueses</HI> lost by the
avariciousness of him who commanded in the Fort,
who having sold the Provisions laid up for the use
of the Garrison, to the <HI>Arabians</HI> at an excessive price,
in hopes of receiving fresh supplies in a little time;
the King of the Country took hold of this oppor∣tunity,
streightly Besieged the place, and forced the
<HI>Portugueses</HI> to surrender at Discretion. The <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
remain ever since at Enmity with these <HI>Arabi∣ans,</HI>
but have hitherto not been able to recover the
Fort.</P>
<P>From hence we coasted it along to the Cape of
<HI>Mosandan,</HI> where the Gulph begins to be so straight,
that the Land appears on both sides. Not far from
this Cape we discovered a Vessel, after which, pur∣suant
to our orders, we made all the sail we could
to come up with her. But finding that she avoid∣ed
our Company, we gave her a Cannon Ball, and
put up our Flag, when the Captain came on board
of us, and shew'd us his Pass from the <HI>French</HI> East-India
Company, by which it appear'd that she be∣longed
to some Merchants of <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>We came afterwards in sight of the Isle of <HI>Are∣que,</HI>
and it being a misty Morning, we took it for
that of <HI>Ormus;</HI> but we were soon undeceived as we
came nearer, and passed betwixt the two Islands of
<HI>Areque</HI> and <HI>Cevichemiche,</HI> near the last of which we
were forced to come to an Anchor, by reason of a
tempest that surprised us hereabouts. This proved
a most terrible Night to us, the Tempest being so
<PB N="176" REF="104"/>
violent as to put us in fear of losing our Anchors,
which if it had happened, we must have infallibly
split against the Rocks.</P>
<P>No sooner did day appear, but we left this dan∣gerous
place, and came to an Anchor in the Road
of <HI>Baudar Abasty,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Gameron,</HI> where
we found the St. <HI>Francis</HI> riding at Anchor, she ha∣ving
been there but two days before us; she came
last from <HI>Bassora,</HI> a City of <HI>Arabia,</HI> Situate upon
the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and was taken by the <HI>Turks</HI>
in the Year 1669.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Gameron, and of Ormus.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BAudar Abasty</HI> is a City belonging to the King
of <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Gameron.</HI></NOTE> having received its name from their
King <HI>Shach Abas,</HI> who caused this City to be Re∣paired
and Beautified. It was formerly called <HI>Ga∣meron,</HI>
and is Situate under the twenty seventh degree
of North Latitude; it is one of the largest and best
peopled Cities in those parts, where there is always
a great concourse of Merchants, as well <HI>Persians</HI> as
Foreigners Most of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships touch in this
Port, it being look'd upon as the staple of such <HI>In∣dian</HI>
Commodities as are consumed in <HI>Persia;</HI> their
Houses are built two Stories high, being flat and
Tarrassed on the top with Summer Houses, the
better to enjoy the benefit of the fresh Air. The
Streets are here very narrow, and their Market-places
not extraordinary large. People of Quality
divert themselves in their Country Houses built a∣mong
the Mountains, from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> du∣ring
which time, few others but Merchants, and
<PB N="177" REF="104"/>
those depending on them, are to be seen in the
City.</P>
<P>The Situation of this place is such, as to contri∣bute
not a little to the inconveniencies occasioned
by the excessive heats. For just without the Walls
of the City, to the East, there are several high
Rocky Hills, from whence the burning rage of the
Sun reflecting upon the City and the Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Situati∣on.</NOTE> makes
the heats almost insupportable. Besides which, the
hot South Winds lay so continually upon the Port,
which choaks up the Foreign Mariners not used to
the Climate, abundance of whom die very sud∣denly.</P>
<P>Upon these Hills there are vast quantities of the
Roses, we call Roses of <HI>Jericho,</HI> which open as soon
as they are put in Water, and shut again as soon as
taken out. The Mountains of <HI>Arabia</HI> lie on the o∣ther
side of the Gulph, which is not above eight
Leagues broad hereabouts.</P>
<P>There is not one fountain in this great City;
some Wells they have, but the Water is brackish:
So that they fetch all their fresh Water at a Leagues
distance from the Town. They have a certain kind
of Earthen Vessels, in which they keep their Wa∣ter
as cool as if it had been lately drawn from the
Spring.</P>
<P>The Ground about <HI>Baudar Abasty</HI> is very Sandy,
and consequently not very fruitful, but some
Leagues from thence, there grows most excellent
Wine, which they call <HI>Chiras</HI> Wine. They use
also another sort of White Wine, which is made
in the Isle of <HI>Quichemiche,</HI> where the Grapes are
without Stones.</P>
<P>Several of the <HI>European</HI> Nations have their Fa∣ctories
at <HI>Gameron,</HI> this City being a free Port for
all Foreigners to Trade in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> are all Mahometans, and so is their
Prince, but as there are abundance of Pagans also
in <HI>Persia,</HI> they allow them the free Exercise of their
Religion in their Temples, and their publick Bath∣ing
places. I met near this place with some of these
<PB N="178" REF="105"/>
Trees, of which I have spoken before, to wit,
that they turn their Branches down-ward, and when
they touch the Ground, they take root immediate∣ly:
I saw here one of this kind, under which 6000
Men might have been placed with good conveni∣ency.
I also met with a Pagan, whose hair was a∣bove
fifteen foot long, he was one of that Sect they
call <HI>Faquirs.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess, I did not stay long enough at <HI>Ga∣meron,</HI>
to make particular observations concerning
all their Manners and Customs; but thus much I
took notice of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants of <HI>Game∣ron.</HI></NOTE> That the Men are generally very
Civil and Complaisant, and the Women as Amo∣rous
as they are Handsome. They are not very
scrupulous in granting a favour to Strangers, many
of them looking upon it as a meer piece of Gallan∣try.</P>
<P>About three Leagues distant from the Continent
of <HI>Gameron,</HI> are three Islands: The first and the big∣gest
of all extends it self all along the Coast to the
North of <HI>Congo,</HI> a place about fifteen Leagues di∣stant
from <HI>Gameron,</HI> where the <HI>Portugueses</HI> share the
Customs with the <HI>Persians.</HI> The first of these Islands
is called <HI>Quichemiche.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quiche∣miche.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second is called <HI>Areque,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Areque.</NOTE> situate more to the
South, being uninhabited by reason of the lowness
of the Grounds. It has not above three Leagues in
compass. We were in no small danger of being cast
away, as we passed betwixt these two Islands, as we
were going to <HI>Baudar Abasty.</HI></P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Ormus</HI> is not above a Mile distant
from <HI>Areque</HI> to the South.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ormus.</NOTE> This Isle is much of the
same bigness with the former, but the Grounds are
not so low. Here are whole Mountains of Salt,
which by reason of their Whiteness, are seen at a
great distance at Sea. The ground is quite unfit to
produce any thing for the conveniency or sustenance
of Mankind, neither does it afford any fresh Water,
which they are obliged to carry thither from the Con∣tinent,
and to keep it in Cisterns.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="105"/>
The <HI>Portugueses</HI> built formerly in this Island a ve∣ry
strong Fort, which remains entire to this day,
with all its Artillery. They were droven from
thence by the <HI>Persians,</HI> with the assistance of the
<HI>English,</HI> who in recompence of this piece of service,
had granted them the one moity of all the Customs
of <HI>Baudar Abasty,</HI> by the <HI>Persian</HI> King. The <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
nevertheless enjoy the freedom of the Port, as
well as other Foreigners. Formerly they used to
fish for and catch very fine Pearls, betwixt this I∣sland
and the Continent, but at present they catch
most small ones, and those not very often.</P>

<P>WE having no other business in <HI>Persia,</HI> than to

<P>Some days after we discovered four sails of Ships,
which we believing to be <HI>Hollanders,</HI> put us under
some apprehensions of danger, for which reason,
we made a Merchant Man, belonging to <HI>Suratte,</HI>
lead the Van to get what intelligence they could of
them; but our fear was groundless, these four ships
proving to be <HI>French,</HI> and were commanded by

The Directors of the <HI>French</HI> East-India

had sent these three Ships to join us, with or∣ders

falling into the Hands of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet,
which they had intelligence to be out at Sea, com∣ing

<P>There happened some difference betwixt the two

with orders from the Directors, for the other to take

the matter went no further.</P>
<P>Though we were continually pestered with con∣trary
Winds, yet did we on the Sixth of <HI>January,</HI>
pass within sight of <HI>Diu,</HI> where there is a <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Colony, which had been some years before pilla∣ged
by the <HI>Arabians.</HI> For some days after, the
Wind blowing a favourable Gale from the North-east,
we came within sight of the shoar near <HI>Bassaim</HI>
on the tenth.</P>
<P>Just at the Entrance of the Port of <HI>Bombay,</HI> there
lies a Rock, which stretching a Mile deep into the
Sea, makes this passage very dangerous; for which
reason we sent for some Pilots, who conducted us
very safely on the <HI>12th.</HI> into the Harbour, which
is one of the safest in the World, provided you are
well acquainted with the Situation of the place, to
avoid the Rocks.</P>
<P>It was not many years ago in the possession of
the <HI>Portugueses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bombay.</NOTE> who surrendred it to the <HI>English</HI> at
<PB N="181" REF="106"/>
the time of the marriage betwixt the King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
with the Infanta of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> have since that time built there a ve∣ry
fine Fort, where the President of their East In∣dia
Company commonly keeps his Residence. They
have also laid the Foundation of a City, where they
grant Liberty to all strangers of what Religion or
Nation soever to settle themselves, and exempt them
from all manner of Taxes for the first twenty years.
We were treated here with abundance of Civility,
which we in part attributed to the good understand∣ing
there was at that time betwixt those two Nati∣ons.</P>
<P>We sent notice of our arrival at <HI>Bombay,</HI> to our
Directors at <HI>Suratte,</HI> and having received orders
from them to set sail without any further delay for
that Port, we weighed Anchor and left <HI>Bombay</HI> the
<HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> and in two days after came in the
Road of <HI>Suratte.</HI> We found there the St. <HI>John</HI> of
<HI>Bayonne,</HI> and another Vessel commanded by the Si∣eur
<HI>de Guille;</HI> they both belonged to the Sieur <HI>de
la Haye.</HI> They were together with the St. <HI>James,</HI>
bound for St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> whither they were to carry
the Sieur <HI>Baron,</HI> who with some Forces was going
to the relief of the abovementioned Sieur <HI>de la Haye,</HI>
who was Besieged by the forces of the King of <HI>Gol∣conda,</HI>
in the City he had taken from them before.</P>
<P>After my return from <HI>Persia</HI> to <HI>Suratte,</HI> I received
Letters from my Father out of <HI>France;</HI> the bearer of
them was one Mr. <HI>Care</HI> a Clergy-man, who being
obliged to go streightways to St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to carry
certain Instructions to Mr. <HI>la Haye,</HI> from the East-India
Company out of <HI>France,</HI> from whence he was
come with all the expedition imaginable by Land,
he had left them with the Sieur <HI>Petit,</HI> who was to
deliver them to me.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>Baron</HI> was no sooner gone for St. <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI>
but the Sieur <HI>Greton</HI> began to get his Equipage
in readiness, in order for his departure into <HI>Persia,</HI>
whither he was to go in the quality of an Ambassa∣dor.
Accordingly he set sail out of the road of <HI>Su∣ratte,</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="107"/>
on the 20th day of <HI>February,</HI> notwithstand∣ing
it was noised about the Town that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet had been seen on that Coast. But before his
departure, having obtained permission from him
to go whither I thought most convenient my self,
I disposed every thing to quit <HI>Suratte</HI> with the first
opportunity, to satisfie my Curiosity in some other
parts of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">My Departure from Suratte.</HEAD>
<P>MY chief design was to visit after my departure
from <HI>Suratte,</HI> all the places in the possession
of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> on that Coast as far as <HI>Goa,</HI> and
from thence to Travel into the Country of <HI>Benga∣la.</HI>
And as I was sufficiently sensible of what con∣sequence
it was to a Stranger Travelling in those
parts, to be provided with good recommendations
from persons of Note, I Address'd my self to the
Reverend Father <HI>Ambrose de Previlly,</HI> a Capuchin,
who accordingly gave me a Letter of recommen∣dation
to Father <HI>John de Forsecap,</HI> Rector of the
College of Jesuits in the City of <HI>Daman,</HI> whither
I was to go first of all. He was so kind as not
only to recommend me to him in person, but also
earnestly to desire him to favour me with his re∣commendatory
Letters to such places as I should
have occasion to visit hereafter.</P>
<P>After I had taken my farewel of all my Friends
at <HI>Suratte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaves</HI> Suratte.</NOTE> I set out from thence on the 3d day of
<HI>March.</HI> I Travell'd by Land in a Calash, drawn
according to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fashion, by 2 Oxen, with∣out
any other Company but my Guide. We laid
<PB N="183" REF="107"/>
that Night at a House which stood all alone,
where we had pretty good Accommodation. The
next day we came to <HI>Gandivi,</HI> where, notwith∣standing
I was provided with a Pass, I was stopp'd
by the Guard of the Town, who detain'd my
Goods; but having made my Complaints to the
Governour, he ordered them to let me pass with∣out
any further hindrance; so that early the next
Morning I pursued my Journey to the River of
<HI>Daman,</HI> where my Guide left me. I passed the
River the same Night, and being not ignorant of
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue, I was in a capacity to pro∣vide
for my self a Lodging, which I took up at a
certain <HI>Indian</HI>'s House, who being turn'd <HI>Christian,</HI>
made it his Business to Lodge Foreign Travellers.
The House was all of Straw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes to <HI>Daman.</HI></NOTE> and the Chamber
where I was to Sleep, open on the Top, the better
to enjoy the benefit of the fresh Air. Our Host's
Employment was to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke <HI>Aqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vitae</HI> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,

the City, of which I will give you a short Descrip∣tion

in possession of it to this day; it is about
20 Leagues from <HI>Suratte,</HI> and 80 from <HI>Goa;</HI> it
is not very large, but strong and neatly kept; the

The Houses are all handsome Buildings, and
the Churches very Magnificent, especially the Pa∣rish

defended themselves with great bravery against an

is one of the most considerable the <HI>Portugueses</HI>
are Masters of in these parts: He that was Gover∣nour
there at that time, was one <HI>Manuel Furtado de

there is a very safe Harbour for Ships, unless it hap∣pen

are sometimes forced from their Anchors, if they
be not carefully look'd after.</P>
<P>The City lies not above a good Cannon Shot
from the Sea side, and on the opposite Shoar of
the River is the Fort of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort of <HI>St. Jerom.</HI></NOTE> which is a great
addition to the Strength and defence of <HI>Daman;</HI>
for which reason it is, that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> are more
careful of this Fort, than of any other they are
Masters of in the <HI>Indies,</HI> they not allowing any
<HI>Negroes</HI> to be received among the Soldiers of the
Garrison, which always consists of 400 Men at
least. Every one of these are obliged to lie eve∣ry
Night within the Fort, and if any one chances
to do otherwise, without special leave from the Go∣vernour,
(who never grants it but upon extraor∣dinary
occasions,) they lose their Pay for that day,
for the first offence, and the second time they are
Cashier'd. The Governour of this Fort has no
dependance on the Governour of the City; they
are never above 3 Years in the same post, a Cu∣stom
observed by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> with all the rest

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Concerning our stay at Daman.</HEAD>
<P>NOT long before my Arrival at <HI>Daman,</HI> the
Sieur <HI>de St. James,</HI> Son of a <HI>French</HI> Physician,
and another young <HI>French</HI> Man, were Married
there. The last of these two had Married the Ba∣stard
Sister of a Lady of Quality, called <HI>Donna Pe∣tronilla
de la Cerda,</HI> who, after she was a Widow,
had Married a person of the first Rank among the
<HI>Portugueses.</HI> The Sieur <HI>de St. James</HI> had Married
the Daughter of this Lady, whose Name being <HI>Don∣na
Rosa de Mello,</HI> was in all respects answerable to
her Youth and Beauty.</P>
<P>I having heard much talk of them at <HI>Suratte,</HI>
I thought my self under an indispensible obligati∣on
to pay them a visit. But the first thing I did
was to deliver my recommendation to the Rector
of the Jesuit College, who receiv'd me with all
the Civility imaginable, and conducted me to the
Governour, who after he had treated me according
to his Quality, proposed to me to stay at <HI>Daman,</HI>
where there was at that time no other Physician,
but some <HI>Pagan Indians,</HI> whose Practice consisting
only in a few Receipts, they apply them indiffe∣rently
to all Patients. I return'd his Compliment,
desiring some time to consider of the matter; and
the Rector of the Jesuits observing my inclination
to Travelling to be more prevailing with me than
the Prospect of present advantages, urged me to
accept of the Governour's offers, assuring me, that
he would make use of all his interests for my fur∣ther
advantage.</P>
<P>The next following day I paid a visit to my
two Country-Men, of whom I spoke just now,
<PB N="186" REF="109"/>
they were overjoyed to see me, and Treated me
with a most Magnificent Collation; in the mean
while, the Sieur <HI>de St. James</HI> had spoke in my be∣half,
to his Mother-in-law, to desire her permissi∣on
to let me Lodge in their House, which she ha∣ving
easily granted, they had without my know∣ledge
sent for my Trunks, so that when after some
Hours stay, I was going to take my leave, they
intreated me to accept of their House, which at
their reiterated intreaties I could not refuse to my
two generous Country-Men.</P>
<P>I was not ignorant of the Custom of the <HI>Portu∣gueses,</HI>
with whom you can scarce meet with suffici∣ent
circumspection, in respect of the fair Sex, I
did not as yet mention one word concerning their
Ladies; but the next day they were the first that
mentioned and proposed a visit to them; I seem'd
to be careless in the matter, and having spent the
greatest part of the day in visiting some of my
Patients in the City, at my return towards Night,
they introduced me to them in their Apartments,
where I entertained them with the same freedom
as we do in <HI>France,</HI> whereat they seem'd not at
all displeased. They did ask me many Questions,
which I answered as well as I could, and <HI>Donna Pe∣tronilla</HI>
Addressing her Discourse to me, above the
rest, we did not part till late at Night.</P>
<P>I did not fail afterwards to visit them at least
once a day, and <HI>Petronilla</HI> treated me always with
more than ordinary Civility. She was of about
39 years of Age, notwithstanding which, she had
sufficient Charms, being of a very pleasing Aspect,
of an admirable Shape, delicately featured and a∣greeable
in all respects; she had a very lively Eye,
and her Humour was the sweetest and most Com∣plaisant
in the World. We diverted our selves to∣gether
for some Hours every Night, and I must con∣fess
that I never passed three Weeks more pleasantly
than these, in all my life time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Trapor.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DOnna Petronilla's</HI> Seat was at <HI>Trapor,</HI> she being
only come to <HI>Daman</HI> about some particular
Business; she was to be at home with her Hus∣band
before <HI>Easter,</HI> and desired me to conduct her
Home, being not above 10 Leagues from <HI>Daman.</HI>
Having first asked the Governour's Leave, I ac∣cepted
of their kind offer, and Travelled with
their whole Family towards <HI>Trapor.</HI> On the <HI>Mon∣day</HI>
of the Holy Week we laid at a place called
<HI>Danou,</HI> a Lordship belonging to the Eldest Son of
<HI>Donna Petronilla;</HI> near to this is the Mountain
called the <HI>Picque</HI> of <HI>Danou,</HI> resembling in shape a
Sugar Loaf; which lying betwixt <HI>Suratte</HI> and <HI>Bas∣saim,</HI>
serves for a guide to the Ships that Sail near
this Coast; there is here a small River which bears
no Ships of any Burthen but only some small
Craft.</P>
<P><HI>Donna Petronilla's</HI> Husband met us at <HI>Danou,</HI> and
received me with all imaginable Civility, and
the <HI>Wednesday</HI> following we came to <HI>Trapor</HI> or <HI>Ta∣rapour.</HI></P>
<P>This is a small City Built on the Sea side, half
ways betwixt <HI>Daman</HI> and <HI>Bassaim,</HI> belonging to
the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who have here a Deputy Gover∣nour,
depending on the Governour of <HI>Daman.</HI>
The Inhabitants here are very Rich, tho' the Ri∣ver
be so shallow as not to be Navigable, unless by
small Ships. There is but one Parish Church,
one Chapel belonging to the Charitable Society,
and a Church belonging to the <HI>Jacobin-Friars.</HI> On
the <HI>Friday</HI> in the Afternoon we heard a Sermon of
<PB N="188" REF="110"/>
the Passion of Christ, and the Priest made many
pauses, the more passionately, as I suppose, to re∣present
the Mystery of the matter he was treating
of. The Women sit in a Gallery by themselves
at Church, and have Curtains drawn before them,
to avoid their being seen by the Men; but if
they are not seen they make themselves to be un∣derstood
by their knocking their Breasts, by their
Sighs and Groans, which they send forth as often
as the Priest says any thing that moves Compassion.
Nevertheless, there are many among them, who
make but ill use of this Holy-day, and under the
cloak of this affected Zeal, carry on their Intrigues.</P>
<P>After Sermon we saw the Procession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Procession at <HI>Trapor.</HI></NOTE> which was
preceded by several Penitents, who having their
Faces covered, and their Backs naked, did whip them∣selves
with so much eagerness, that the Blood fol∣lowed
the lash. After these came the Inhabitants
of the place, each with a lighted Torch in his
Hand, and then the Priests. Immediately after
them was carried the Image, representing our Sa∣viour's
descending from the Cross, which being
surrounded with about 20 young <HI>Negroes</HI> Mask'd
and arm'd with Lances, with a Captain at the
head of them, and several Drums and Trumpets,
made alltogether a very strange Spectacle. For,
after they had taken a round in the City, the Cru∣cifix
was Solemnly Interr'd in a Sepulchre prepa∣red
for that purpose; and I must confess that this
Ceremony, which in other places, where the whole
is transacted with more decency, inspires the peo∣ple
with Devotion, did appear so ridiculous among
the <HI>Portugueses</HI> in those parts, that I could scarce
forbear Laughing my self.</P>
<P>I went again to Church on <HI>Saturday,</HI> where I saw
nothing worth particular Observation. But on
<HI>Easter-Sunday,</HI> after I had been present at the Cere∣mony,
when the Holy Sacrament was carried from
the <HI>Jacobin</HI> to the Parish Church, I heard there a
Sermon, which being the oddest I ever heard in my
Life, I cannot forbear mentioning some passages of
<PB N="189" REF="110"/>
it here: The Priest being come into the Pulpit,
and having made the Sign of the Cross;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Sermon.</NOTE> <Q>Gen∣tlemen,
(said he,) you cannot be ignorant, that
for three particular reasons we always have a
Sermon on <HI>Easter-Sunday.</HI> The first is to wish
a Merry Feast to the Congregation; the second
to put you in mind of my <HI>Easter</HI> Eggs; and
the third, to tell you a Merry Tale to make you
Laugh. Not to recede from my former Custom,
and to give you all due satisfaction as to the first
point, I wish you all Merry <HI>Easter</HI> Holy-days;
as to the second, I can assure you, that if you
will be pleased to send me some <HI>Easter</HI> Eggs I will
not refuse them. And as to what concerns the
third, I will only tell you, that I met yesterday
our Fatgutted <HI>Gregory,</HI> and what do you think I
said to him? I asked him whether he would al∣ways
act the Person of <HI>Pilate</HI> in the Passion of
our Saviour.</Q> With this he left the Pulpit, with∣out
as much as imparting the Benediction to his Au∣ditors,
who Laugh'd out aloud, that you might
have heard them at a considerable distance.</P>
<P>I passed the <HI>Easter</HI> Holy-days with a great deal of
satisfaction, which with the constant intreaties of
my Friends to stay me for some time longer, would
have been a sufficient motive for me not to quit a
place, where I received daily new proofs of their
Affection towards me, if I had not been engaged
upon my part to the Governour, to return to <HI>Da∣man</HI>
after the Holy-days were over.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">My return to Daman.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore <HI>Donna Petronilla</HI> went to <HI>Trapor,</HI> she had
done me the favour to introduce me into the
Acquaintance of Father <HI>John de St. Michael,</HI> Supe∣riour
of the <HI>Jacobins,</HI> and at my departure, she was
so generous as to give me a Letter of Recommen∣dation,
wherein, she desir'd him to serve me in eve∣ry
thing that might be in his power. I had left my
Trunks and other moveables with him, when we
departed for <HI>Trapor,</HI> so that I was obliged to make
my first visit to him, and to fetch away my Trunks;
but the Father had the goodness to engage me to
stay with him, till such time as I had taken a reso∣lution
whether I would settle at <HI>Daman,</HI> and if not,
till I should have taken a full view of all the Town,
to satisfie my Curiosity.</P>
<P>I remain'd with him thus 14 or 15 days, being
at a great uncertainty what to resolve upon, till
at last being overcome by the Civilities and intrea∣ties
of the Governour, and the Prayers of the In∣habitants,
who made me very advantageous offers,
I thought I ought not to refuse the kindness of my
Friends, who shew'd themselves the most Zealous
promoters of my concerns.</P>
<P>Accordingly I left the Convent, and having set∣tled
my self in a House of my own, I chose some
few Friends among the rest of the Inhabitants,
with whom I might divert my self at seasonable
<PB N="191" REF="111"/>
times, when I was at leisure from my Practice,
which needs must happen very often in a little place,
where I could visit a good number of Patients in a
few Hours.</P>
<P>There was at that time a certain Lady of great
Quality, called <HI>Senhora Francisca Sereira,</HI> living at
<HI>Daman,</HI> and one of her Daughters falling ill of a
violent and most dangerous Fever, I was call'd
to her, and had the good fortune to recover her,
which so deeply engaged the Lady in my interest,
that I cannot sufficiently acknowledge her genero∣sity,
and must confess that she was one main in∣strument
in making me stay so long at <HI>Daman</HI> as I
did.</P>
<P>For tho' I must confess that I received all the
kind usage I could expect from the Inhabitants of
this place, yet the natural propensity I had to Tra∣velling,
and to make curious and new. Observati∣ons
abroad over-balancing all other Considerati∣ons,
I did at last resolve to leave <HI>Daman.</HI> Pursuant
to this resolution, I took the conveniency of the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet, which goes every year to <HI>Cambe∣ja.</HI>
This Fleet being under the Command of <HI>Jo∣seph
de Mello,</HI> Arrives at <HI>Daman</HI> towards the latter
end of <HI>December,</HI> and was to be ready to Sail for
<HI>Goa</HI> towards the beginning of <HI>January.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our departure from Daman.</HEAD>
<P>ALL my Friends at <HI>Daman</HI> having in vain en∣deavoured
to detain me longer, I took at last
my leave of them, and embark'd my self upon one
of the Galleots belonging to the above mentioned
Fleet. We set sail on the first day of <HI>January</HI> for
<HI>Bassaim,</HI> where we were to stay for the Galleots,
which were behind at <HI>Cambeja.</HI></P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Bassaim</HI> the next day in the After∣noon,
when I, to satisfie my curiosity, went into
the Town, where I met with the Sieur <HI>de Segvine∣au,</HI>
a <HI>French</HI> Physician, who formerly came with me
in the same Ship from <HI>Madagascar</HI> to <HI>Suratte,</HI> and be∣ing
since that time Married and settled in this place,
gave me all the real demonstrations of a most sin∣cere
Friendship.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Bassaim</HI> lies twenty Leagues South
of <HI>Daman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Bassaim.</HI></NOTE> and is about four times longer. Their
Churches here are very Rich, and most magnifi∣cently
Built, their private Houses very neat and
Commodious, the Market places very large and
handsome, and the Streets very clean and regular:
It is surrounded with a Wall, but the Fortifications
are but slight.</P>
<P>The greatest conveniency belonging to this City,
is the River which washes its very Walls, and is a
safe Harbour for Ships of the greatest Burthen at
all Seasons, which draws thither the Merchants
from all parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Harbour.</NOTE> and renders the City one of the most
considerable the <HI>Portugueses</HI> are masters of in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>There live more Gentry in and about this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE>
than at <HI>Goa,</HI> from whence comes the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Pro∣verb,
<HI>Fidalgos de Bassaim,</HI> that is to say, Gentlemen
<PB N="193" REF="112"/>
of <HI>Bassaim,</HI> the Grounds hereabouts are extreamly
fertile, and produce great store of Rice.</P>
<P>Just without the Gates of the City is that famous
Church called by the <HI>Portugueses, Nossa senhora de re∣medio,</HI>
which being formerly a noted Pagan Tem∣ple,
is since turned into a Christian Church, where
due Reverence is paid to the true God. Upon the
great Altar is to be seen the miraculous Image of the
Holy Virgin.</P>
<P>They relate that a Thief having cast his Eyes
upon the rich Crown she wears upon her Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Indian</HI> Miracle.</NOTE>
had hid himself in the Church, with an intention
to steal it as soon as the Church should be shut up.
Accordingly the Villain approaching the Image,
was going to take off the Crown, but by a most sur∣prizing
Miracle, both the Robber and Crown be∣came
immoveable in the same instant, in which po∣sture
he was found so soon as the Church doors
were opened. There is a part of the Fore-head,
(which they say is the place where he fix'd his
Thumb) which at a distance, shines as bright as a
Star, and as you draw nearer and nearer, it disappears
by degrees, so that when you come to touch it, you
find nothing extraordinary in the matter.</P>
<P>This Image is in such Veneration in those parts,
that not alone the Christians, but also the Maho∣metans
and Pagans make their Vows to it, before
they undertake any thing of Moment, and as these
Vows commonly consist in some offerings or other,
this Church has gathered vast Riches.</P>
<P>We staid at <HI>Bassaim</HI> about five or six days, and
then set sail for <HI>Goa,</HI> where we arrived on the four∣teenth
day of <HI>January</HI> towards Night. I went on
shoar the next day, and by the advantageous offers
made by my Friends, was prevailed upon to stay near
three whole Years in this great City, of which I
have given you a Description before.</P>
<P>After this, some Affairs of moment happening,
which required my presence in my Native Country,
I was obliged to quit the <HI>Indies,</HI> in order to my spee∣dy
return into <HI>Europe.</HI> I took therefore the conve∣niency
<PB N="194" REF="113"/>
of a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Galeon, which being ready
to set sail for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> I (with the permission of the
Governour) embark'd my self in the said Vessel

him any Chirurgeons, but only a Barber to Trim
and let Blood upon occasion, and therefore he
hoped I would not refuse the offer he would make
me, to take care of the Ship as a Physician, and
that I should be honourably rewarded for my pains.
I return'd him thanks for his good Opinion, and
having accepted his offer, I was considered in the
quality of the Physician of the Ship.</P>
<P>We went on with a favourable Gale, till we
came under the Equinoctial Line, where we were
becalmed for a few days, when the Winds proving
again to our satisfaction, we continued our Voyage
with all the imaginable success, till we came under
the thirteenth degree of Southern Latitude. There
it was that the Winds began to change continually,
but as it did not blow hard, so we advanced some∣thing
every day in our Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="113"/>
We passed a great way to the East of the Isle
<HI>Dauphin,</HI> and towards the end of the Month of
<HI>March</HI> came to the height of the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI>
where our Pilots had a mind to sound the Coast,
for their better Instruction, when they should hap∣pen
to come this way another time; the Wind be∣ing
then in the East, and consequently very fair for
us, blew very briskly in the beginning of the Holy
Week, and on the Holy <HI>Wednesday</HI> grew so violent,
that we were forced to take in'most all our sails, and
to make use only of- our fore-mast Sail. The Sea
runs so terribly high, that our ship was tossed most
violently; notwithstanding which, we continued
our course, knowing-our selves to be far enough
from the shoar, to stand in fear of any sinister acci∣dent
from thence. But on <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning, the
Wind chop'd about to the West,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are over∣taken by a violent Storm.</NOTE> and blew so ter∣ribly,
that we began to be afraid of our Ship,
which though one of the strongest that ever I saw,
let in so much Water, that two Pumps were scarce
able to throw it out as fast as it came in. We chan∣ged
our course and run it before the Wind, which
continued with so much violence, that even the
most expert and most courageous of our Seamen be∣gan
to be afraid; but after a Storm which lasted
four and twenty Hours, the Wind veering about
to the East, we altered a second time our Course,
and with a moderate Gale stood it in towards the
Cape, which we discovered on the Holy <HI>Saturday</HI>
early in the Morning. We were again becalmed
for some days, till the next day after the Holy Days,
when with a North East Wind we doubled the Cape
of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> but were not within sight of it, being
afraid of being becalmed again if we did not keep
out at Sea.</P>
<P>We saw hereabouts several wracks of Ships which
we believed to have been lost in the late Tempest.</P>
<P>Towards Night we discovered a Vessel, which
steered a quite contrary course to us; but as they are
constantly upon their Guard at Sea, our Captain or∣dered
every thing to be got in readiness, if there
<PB N="196" REF="114"/>
should be any occasion of Engaging an Enemy; but
the next Morning at break of day, we found them
at so great a distance from us, that we had all the
reason to believe, there would be no occasion for
fighting at this time.</P>
<P>In the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are trou∣bled with the Scurvy.</NOTE> we had a worse Enemy
within our own Ship; this was that pernicious Evil,
the Scurvy, which in the month of <HI>April,</HI> began to
make a great havock among our Ships Crew, and
notwithstanding all our Precautions, kill'd us some
of our Men every day: To add to our Affliction
we were often becalmed, till at last a favourable
Gale arising, we made towards the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI>
where we were to touch in our Voyage, so that on
the <HI>19th.</HI> day of <HI>May,</HI> we discovered the shoar of
<HI>Brasil,</HI> near the Bay of <HI>All-Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Some Fishermen who were out at Sea, having
discovered our Vessel, came on board of us about
Noon, who undertook to conduct us safely into the
Road, but had almost lost our Ship, she striking
upon the Sands, but as good fortune would have it,
so slightly, that it drew us into no further ill con∣sequences.
But we had all the reason in the World
to thank Providence for our delivery, a Ship of the
same bulk with ours having been lost in the same
place some years before, so that scarce a Man escap∣ed
with life, of a thousand that belonged to the
Ship. But the advantage of a very fair Day and
Wind, joined with the indefatigable care of our
Mariners, made us by God's Providence escape the
danger, which threatned no less than our Destructi∣on.
Being got clear of the Sands, we came to an
Anchor at a good distance from thence, and the next
day being the <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> entered the Port and
cast Anchor before the Town, which bears the same
name with the Bay. We had lost five and twenty of
our Men in our Voyage from <HI>Goa,</HI> and had above
300 more on board, so terribly afflicted with the
Scurvy, that if we had been detained but never so
little a while longer at Sea, most of them would in∣fallibly
have died.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Arrival in Brasil, and its Description.</HEAD>
<P>DUring my stay in <HI>Brasil,</HI> I got intimately ac∣quainted
with a certain Merchant, a <HI>Spaniard</HI>
by Birth, but who having lived for a considerable
time in those parts, gave me an exact account of
the whole state of affairs of this Country, and
shew'd me much kindness in all other respects. I
am not ignorant, that several others before me have
given us an account of <HI>Brasil,</HI> nevertheless I will in∣sert
shortly what observations I have made here.</P>
<P><HI>Brasil</HI> is Situate on the Eastern Coast of <HI>America,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Descrip∣tion of <HI>Bar∣sil.</HI></NOTE>
where the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> (who where the first and sole
discoverers of it) have built several Towns and crea∣ted
Colonies, which now, after a long and vigo∣rous
War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who disputed with them
the possession of it, they enjoy quietly. The Coun∣try
is very pleasant, the Air tolerably good and
temperate, by reason of the frequent Rains, which
in a great measure, allay the heat of the Sun. The
Ground here produces abundance of Fruits with∣out
being cultivated; such as Citrons, Lemons, O∣ranges,
Ananas, Bananas, and several others. There
are also Grapes in <HI>Brasil,</HI> but not in such plenty as
in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They have prodigious quantities of Canes, which
turn to a mighty account, if the inhabitants did im∣prove
them to the best advantage, and knew how
to vend them abroad. From <HI>Brasil</HI> comes most excellent
Tobacco, and here it is that they have sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of
those Water Melons, which surpass all other k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds
in goodness. The Grounds of <HI>Brasil</HI> will not pro∣duce
<PB N="198" REF="115"/>
any Garlick or Onions. They are obliged to
be furnished with them from <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>They have also abundance of Coco's in <HI>Brasil,</HI> but
they coming not near in bigness to those in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
they make Tobacco and other Boxes of
them, some of them being so small as scarce to be
fit for Beads.</P>
<P>They don't draw any <HI>Tary</HI> from the Coco-trees in
<HI>Brasil,</HI> as they do in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> neither make
they any Suchar of it, or Aqua Vitae, because their
Canes furnish them sufficiently with the first, and
the latter they are supplied with from <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="25" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A further account of Brasil.</HEAD>
<P>BEsides the <HI>Brasil</HI> Wood there are several other
sorts of Trees in this Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties of <HI>Bra∣sil.</HI></NOTE> quite unknown
to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> among which is the chiefest, the
Tree from whence destills that Balsom, we sur∣name
of <HI>Peru:</HI> The Wood is made use of for Cabi∣net
Work for Ladies of Quality, because they have
a most sweet Scent, and Perfume any thing that is
enclosed within them. In the Southern Parts of the
Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Produces no Wheat.</NOTE> they have very good Wheat, but near the
Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> there grows none, and most
other parts of <HI>Brasil</HI> are deprived of the advantage
of this so useful a Commodity. They give two
reasons for it; first, because, say they, the Ground
is not fit for it; and secondly, which I look upon
to be the better of the two, because that they are
pestered hereabouts with such prodigious numbers of
Ants, that they consume the Grains before they take
root. Prillet and Rice grows in all parts of <HI>Brasil,</HI>
but the ordinary Food of the <HI>Brasilians</HI> is the flower
<PB N="199" REF="115"/>
of <HI>Mandioc,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Cassave,</HI> and the
<HI>Portuguese, Farina de Rao.</HI> This <HI>Mandioc</HI> root is pro∣pagated
by cutting of it in pieces, and putting them
into the Ground where they grow to a considerable
bigness; they are very White, and if they are eaten
unprepared, they prove often mortal. They take
away their venomous quality by steeping them in
Water, till they are soft, when they take them out,
and let them dry; this they repeat several times, and
so often, till they think them to be sufficiently cured
of their ill Quality, when they make flower of it,
almost as course in outward appearance as Gun∣powder,
which at the best is but insipid and ve∣ry
heavy, causing obstructions in such as are not u∣sed
to eat it. They make Cakes out of this Flower,
which they call <HI>Bejous,</HI> they are of somewhat a bet∣ter
taste than the common Bread, but retain the
same ill quality.</P>
<P>They are furnished with Wheat from <HI>Rio de Ja∣neiro,</HI>
and with good Flower from <HI>Portugal,</HI> so
that they are not absolutely destitute of wheaten
Bread in this Bay, but it is somewhat dearer here
than in other places. They have also sufficient store
of Oil, Wine, Linen Cloaths, Stuffs, and all o∣ther
Commodities requisite for the Conveniency and
Necessity of Human Life, which are imported
there from <HI>Europe.</HI> Their own Grounds furnish
them sufficiently with Flesh, Poultry and Fish, and
Fruits and Sweet-meats are very cheap here.</P>
<P>But <HI>Brasil</HI> is not without its great inconvenien∣cies;
they are always pestered with a certain kind
of Vermin, or small Worms, of which I shall have
occasion to say more hereafter in the Appendix of
this Relation, which treats of the Dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
those parts: Besides this, the Ants of all sorts, but
especially that kind which is of a reddish Colour,
and bigger than the rest, are a continual Plague to
them; for they cover the Grounds where-ever they
light in such prodigious heaps, that at a distance
you would take them for a little Village. Neither
are the Cities free from this Plague. These Crea∣tures
<PB N="200" REF="116"/>
are at continual War with the Rats and Snakes,
who notwithstanding the advantage of their strength,
in comparison of these little Creatures, yet are al∣ways
worsted by their infinite number.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Inhabitants of Brasil.</HEAD>
<P>NOT to entangle my self here in a tedious di∣gression,
and distinction of the Inhabitants of
this Country; I will only tell you in a few words,
That the Native <HI>Brasilians</HI> are to this day, Idola∣ters;
That they are much addicted to Witchcraft,
or at least are reputed so to be; they are very super∣stitious,
have neither Temples nor Feasts, and adore
the Devil. Their Hair they wear of a great length,
their Complexion is swarthy, they go Naked, are
naturally Brave and Nimble, and never forgive an
Injury. Their Arms are only a few Arrows,
which instead of Iron, are provided with a bone
of a Fish at the end; and if any of them make use
of Iron, they are such as have got it by the conversa∣tion
with the <HI>Europeans.</HI> They are not unskilful
in Husbandry, but are more addicted to Hunting
and Fishing. They eat all sorts of Flesh, and as they
never lay up any Provisions for future use, so they
endure Famine upon an occasion with an unparallell'd
constancy. They are naturally Warlike, and al∣ways
at Wars with one another; such of their
Enemies as they take Prisoners, they Fetter, and
publickly kill them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brasilians</HI> eat their dead Friends.</NOTE> and so eat them. They don't
even interr their dead Friends, but devour them, e∣ven
sometimes before the breath is out of their Bo∣dies.
For if they judge their Friends past all
<PB N="201" REF="116"/>
hopes of recovery, they kill them for fear they
should grow lean before they die; and because
they would husband their Dead Friends to the best
advantage, they dry their Bones, which they beat
to Powder, and make up in a kind of a pap, and
so eat it. When the <HI>Europeans</HI> upbraid them with
their Cruelties, they return us for answer, that we
are a Company of impious wretches, who suffer our
Friends and Parents to be consumed in the Earth by
the Vermine, when we might with more reason afford
them our Belly for their Burying-place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> in <HI>Brasil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Portu∣gueses <HI>in</HI> Brasil.</NOTE> live here for the most
part after the same manner as they do in other pla∣ces,
where they have settled their Colonies. They
have very good Forts in several parts of the Coun∣try.
They compel the Neighbouring <HI>Brasilians</HI> to o∣bey
them, and are so well provided in their Gar∣risons
as not to stand in fear either of the <HI>Brasilians</HI>
or <HI>Europeans,</HI> in case they should come to Attack
them.</P>
<P>Whenever any of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> have the mis∣fortune
to fall into the hands of the Wild <HI>Brasili∣ans,</HI>
whether by the chance of War, or any other
mishap, they receive the same treatment as we
have mentioned before; and these on the other
hand retaliate upon such, as they become Masters
of, the Cruelties committed against their Coun∣try-Men,
and in lieu of one Death, make them to
undergo what is a thousand times worse, I mean,
the most cruel Slavery in the World; all what is
left for the <HI>Brasilians</HI> to do in this case is either vo∣luntarily
to submit to the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> or, if they
find themselves not strong enough to resist them,
to fly and shelter themselves in more remote Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> prompted by an Ambition to ex∣tend
their borders, send constantly abroad their
Parties, who by degrees, as they Conquer these
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> curb them by some Forts, which they
Build in their new Conquests. Whilst I was there,
I was credibly informed that they had extended
<PB N="202" REF="117"/>
their Conquests above 80 Leagues deep into the
Country. They are very careful in instructing
the <HI>Brasilians,</HI> both Free and Slaves in the princi∣ples
of the Christian Religion; and there are some
among the <HI>Portugueses</HI> who have Married these <HI>Bar∣barian</HI>
Women, who tho' otherwise of a good Com∣plexion
and handsome enough, yet in their Beha∣viour
sufficiently shew the remnants of that Bar∣barous
Blood from whence they drew their off∣spring,
and by which they are easily distinguish'd
from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Women.</P>
<P>The vast number of Slaves used by the <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
in <HI>Brasil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Slave∣ry in <HI>Bra∣sil.</HI></NOTE> and the Hardship wherewith they
are treated, not having a sufficient allowance for
their sustenance, and being to be Punished in a
most severe manner for the least fault, proves the
occasion of great disorders and outrages, which are
committed by the Slaves, both in City and Coun∣try.
They are for the most part <HI>Negroes,</HI> brought
thither from <HI>Angola,</HI> and the <HI>Guinea</HI> Coast, their
chief Employment being to work in making of
Sugars, and Planting of Tobacco. They are
brought to Market in whole Droves, where they are
Bought and Sold no otherwise than we do our Cattle.
Those who have great Plantations have several hun∣dreds
of them at a time, who are under the tuiti∣on
of certain Commissaries, who are sometimes more
cruel than their Masters. Those who have no
Grounds of their own, give their Slaves leave to
work where they can, provided they pay them a
certain Tax Monthly or Weekly. Those who
work in their Master's Ground being used with so
much severity, if they fail to perform their Task,
and the rest being commonly overtasked by their
Covetous Masters, this makes them Rob and Steal
where-ever they come in the Country, and being
reduced to despair, they often revenge themselves
upon others for the Torments they are forced to
endure at home.</P>
<P>If these Vagabond Slaves render the High-ways
in the Country very dangerous, it is no less trou∣blesome
<PB N="203" REF="117"/>
to walk the Streets at Night in the Cities;
where, notwithstanding all the precautions, and
the severe Punishments inflicted upon all such as are
Convicted of these Crimes, they commit frequent
Robberies in the Streets.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the City and Port of the Bay of All-Saints.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bay of <HI>All Saints.</HI></NOTE> is Situate under the
15th Degree of Southern Latitude, the Port
from whence the Adjacent City has derived its
Name, is one of the largest and most Commodi∣ous
in the whole Ocean. There are a few Sand
Banks at one side of the Entrance of the Harbour,
but these are not so dangerous, but that they may
be easily avoided, provided you have a Pilot who
is well acquainted with the Coast and the Harbour.
The Entrance and the bottom of the Harbour lie
directly East and West, so that you need but turn
never so little Northwards, where you may cast
Anchor just before the City, and when you are
once got betwixt the two Capes, you are out of
all danger, there being very good Anchorage all
over the Bay, which is so large, as to be able to
contain several thousands of stout Ships. The Bay
is surrounded with very high Lands, which afford
a very pleasant prospect to the Sea-side, they are
irrigated with several small Rivers, which loose
themselves thereabouts before they reach the Sea-side.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="118"/>
Whalefishing is their constant employment in
this Bay from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>September;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whales how taken.</NOTE> there are very
few so ignorant, but what know that this prodi∣gious
Creature is taken by the help of a Dart tied
to a strong Cord. The Fishermen Cruise about
the Bay in their Boats, to watch the coming of the
Whale; so soon as she finds her self Wounded by
the Dart, she flies away, and the Fishermen fol∣low
her at a distance, letting the Cord go after
her, till such time that being quite spent by the
loss of Bloud she dies, and Swims upon the surface
of the Water. Then they draw her to the Shoar,
at high Tides, and cut her to pieces. The Oil
which is drawn from this Fish, is much used in
Lamps all over <HI>Brasil,</HI> and the <HI>Negroes</HI> and some of
the poorer sort eat the substance of the Fish with a
good Appetite.</P>
<P>After you are come about 2 Leagues within the
Bay, you see the City, which directly faces its
Entrance, just before you, where you may safely
ride at Anchor, at about half a League's distance
from the Shoar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>All Saints.</HI></NOTE> The City it self is Built upon a

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Manners and Customs of the Inha∣bitants.</HEAD>
<P>I Am not very well assured whether Debauchery
is so common all over <HI>Brasil,</HI> as it is at the Bay
of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> where even Women who pretend to
a reasonable share of Reputation, look upon it as
a piece of Gallantry to dress up their Female
Slaves in their own Cloaths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are very Debauch'd.</NOTE> to give them the bet∣ter
opportunity of vending their hidden Commo∣dities
at a dearer rate; from whence it may easily
be concluded, that there is scarce any other place
where Debauchery has got such an ascendant as here.
The Women are generally great Admirers of all
Strangers, but especially of the <HI>French;</HI> the worst
is that they are not so acceptable to the Men, who
being naturally Jealous to a degree of Madness,
this infirmity of theirs proves sometimes the occa∣sion
of great mischiefs, as may appear out of the
following relation.</P>
<P>A Young <HI>French</HI> Man who practised Physick in
<HI>Brasil,</HI> was sent for to a Lady that was very ill;
this Lady being Young, Handsome, and Rich,
the Young Physician made use of his best Skill to
recover her as soon as possible he could. He had
the good Fortune not only to restore her to her
Health in a little time, but also to insinuate him∣self
by his constant attendance, into the Affection
both of the Mother and Daughter, so that soon af∣ter
he was Privately Married to the Young Lady,
tho' with the consent of the Mother.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="119"/>
Some Enemies of the Young <HI>French</HI> Man who
envy'd his good Fortune, took an opportunity to
set a certain Gentleman, who had Married his
Wife's Eldest Sister against him, representing to
him, how unbecoming and little suitable it would
be to his Quality, to have a Brother-in-law that
was no more than a Chirurgeon, tho' he had assumed
the Title of a Doctor of Physick, and who perhaps
besides all this might be a Heretick. The Gen∣tleman,
who had more Wealth than good Sence,
being over-perswaded by these Malicious Fellows,
began to exclaim in the presence of the rest of
their Relations, against the indignity put upon the
whole Family by so scandalous a Match, not for∣getting
any thing which he thought might exaspe∣rate
them against this New Brother-in-law; but
finding them not to agree with him in their Sen∣timents,
he came one Night with a select number of
Ruffians into the City, where they found means to
get into the House of his Sister-in-law, and to
cut to pieces a certain Young Man, who bearing
some resemblance to the Young <HI>French</HI> Man they
sought for, and who had saved himself by flight,
pay'd dearly for it by the mistake of these Villains,
who took the flight after they had satisfy'd their re∣venge,
as they believed, for fear of being taken in
the Fact by the Neighbouring Inhabitants, who
were drawn thither by the most lamentable out∣cries
of the Women.</P>
<P>This Bloudy Action being come to the Judge's-Ears,
he ordered some Guards to be put in the
Young <HI>French</HI> Man's House, to prevent a second
Attempt, which they were resolved to make, as
soon as they had got notice that they had missed
their aim.</P>
<P>The Young <HI>French</HI> Man finding himself thus in
danger of being Assassinated, took a resolution to
leave <HI>Brasil,</HI> and to go to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> which he did ac∣cordingly,
never appearing abroad without a good
Guard, till his departure; when I was afterwards
in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> I understood that he was Petitioning the

<P>THE Grand Fleet which goes every Year from

till we came to Cape <HI>Verd.</HI> Much about the same
time it was we got sight of the Isle called <HI>Ferdnand
de Narogna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Isle of</HI> Ferdnand de Narog∣na.</NOTE> having borrowed its name from the
person, who first discovered it. Formerly all the
Ships that passed this way, used to provide them∣selves
with fresh Water in this Island, if they had
occasion for any. But some strangers having left
some of their Dogs behind them, these are multi∣plied
and become wild to that degree, that there is
no coming on shoar in that Island now a days.</P>
<P>As we came within ten degrees of the line,
the Wind began to be very changeable, and proved
soon after quite contrary to us, but it blowing a
pretty even Gale, we advanced by little and little,
till a most dreadful Tempest arising, drove us till
under the <HI>26th.</HI> Degree, where a great many of our
Ships lost their Masts and Sails.</P>
<P>But after having weathered it out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of <HI>Ter∣cera.</HI></NOTE> we at last came
in sight of the Isle of <HI>Tercera,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Por∣tugueses,</HI>
where they kept their King Prisoner for a
considerable time, and in all likelihood he would
have ended there his days, if they had not been
afraid that he might find means to get from thence.
It was on the twenty first of <HI>November,</HI> that we got
sight of this Island, and if the Seas had not run so
high, we would have gone a shoar to refresh our
selves; but as there is never a Port in the whole
Island, and that there is no safe Anchoring in the
Road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of St. <HI>Michael.</HI></NOTE> we continued our course, and on the three
and twentieth, came in sight of the Isle of St. <HI>Mi∣chael,</HI>
where abouts we staid all that Night near the
Cape. The next Morning all our Ships sent their
Chaloups a shoar to fetch some fresh Provisions, but
did not come to an Anchor, that they might be in
readiness to put to Sea upon all occasions, the Hur∣ricanes
being so frequent here at this Season, that
there is no safe riding for Ships.</P>
<P>The Isles of St. <HI>Michael, Tercera,</HI> and some other
adjacent Islands, belong to the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> they are
<PB N="210" REF="121"/>
very fertile, affording great store of very good
Wheat, which being from thence for the most part
transported to <HI>Portugal,</HI> they may well be called the
<HI>Granaries</HI> of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Our Chaloups being returned on the four and
twentieth at Night, we set sail with a North West
Wind, which did not last long, for all on a sudden
the Wind chop'd about to the East,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are over∣taken by a most dread∣ful Tempest.</NOTE> and from
thence to the South with such violence, that this
tempest appear'd to me the most terrible that ever I
saw in my life. It continued thus for ten days to∣gether
in so dreadful a manner, as is scarce to be ex∣pressed;
our Ship began to draw Water on all sides,
and we saw before our Eyes nothing less than our
approaching death. We made all the signals of di∣stress
to the rest by day, and by setting up our lights
by night, but in vain, the horrid darkness, but
above all the violence of the Tempest, had disper∣sed
all our Ships, so that we found our selves alone,
having lost all our sails, except our Fore-mast sail.</P>
<P>We had nothing left to hope for, and therefore be∣took
our selves to Prayers, and the whole ships crew
made their Vows to the Blessed Virgin, under whose
protection we at last escaped the danger. In the
mean while, every thing was in such a confusion, as
is easier to be imagined than to be expressed; the
Waves which rise as high as Mountains, beating
continually over the Ship, which we thought would
have been swallowed up every moment in the bot∣tomless
Abyss. The approaching day rendred
every thing much more supportable, but the dread∣full
darkness of the Nights put us under such appre∣hensions
of approaching death, that we were al∣ways
despairing of ever seeing day again. An ac∣cident
which befell us the last Night, was the most
terrible of all, which put even the most couragious
into despair.</P>
<P>It is to be known, that we had some Top-masts
and Yards in the Ship to make use of upon occasion,
which were so well fastned upon the Deck, that they
had not stirred hitherto. Our two Chaloups were
<PB N="211" REF="121"/>
placed a top of them, one within the other, and in
the smallest of the two, there were some hogs,
which we had brought from <HI>Brasil,</HI> to make pre∣sents
of them in <HI>Portugal,</HI> they being of an extraor∣dinary
size. The most violent tossing of the Ship,
for so many days together, had at last either loosen∣ed
or broke the Ropes, which had fastned all these
things together, so that the Masts, Yards and Cha∣lops
rowling from one side to the other, accor∣ding
to the motion of the Ship, and being thrown
against her sides, we did not imagine otherwise but
that she had been staved to pieces; there was not
one in the Ship, but what was uttering forth his last
Prayers, expecting every moment to be the last of
his life.</P>
<P>We had Passengers and Mariners on Board of
us of several different Nations, each of them offering
their Vows and Moans in a different Language;
this made the most doleful noise that ever was heard,
which together with the darkness of the Night,
made every thing appear more dreadful than it was;
no body daring to go upon the deck for fear of
being crushed to pieces, as we found the Hogs to be
afterwards. At last, Day-light began to appear, the
most wellcome that ever was seen, and our Mari∣ners
taking new Courage with the approaching
light, fastned the Chaloups and Masts again; and
scarce were a few hours past, but the sky began to
clear up, the Sun rejoyced us with its most delight∣ful
Rays, the Winds began to abate their Fury, and
we saw our selves soon freed from the apprehension
of danger.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The pursuit of our Voyage, and our Arrival
at Lisbon.</HEAD>
<P>AFter we had spent some time in putting things
in order, and stopping the leaks occasioned by
the late Tempest, we were cruising up and down,
often changing our course, to try whether we could
meet with any of our Ships, that were separated
from us in the last Storm; but meeting with no
Vessel that could give us the least account of them,
we thought it our best way to direct our course to∣wards
the Port of <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P>On the Eleventh of <HI>December</HI> towards Evening,
our Sentinels discovered a stout Ship making up
towards us; which we believing to be an <HI>Algerine,</HI>
we were getting every thing in readiness for a vi∣gorous
defence, in case we should be attacked by
these Corsairs. We continued in this Posture, the
approaching Night having robbed us of the sa∣tisfaction
to be rightly informed, whether this
Ship were an Enemy or not; as she put out her
Lights all the Night long, so we did the same,
to give them to understand, that we were not a∣fraid
of them. Thus we kept in sight of one a∣nother
till next Morning, and each of us having
done the best we could to come up with one a∣ther,
we soon found our mistake, the Ship pro∣ving
to be one of our Fleet, that had lost our
Company.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="122"/>
Thus we sailed in Company together all that
day, and the next following being the Thirteenth
of the same Month came in sight of the <HI>Por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣guese</HI>
shoar, and towards Night advanced pretty
near to the River, but could not enter it, by
reason of the contrary Winds, we cruised up
and down at its Entrance, till the Fourteenth,
without coming to an Anchor, when being join∣ed
by the rest of the Fleet, that were separa∣ted
from us in the last Storm, except two, that
came in two days after us: We entred the
Port on the Fifteenth in the Morning, with a
satisfaction much easier to be felt, than to be
expressed. We came to an Anchor just oppo∣site
to the King's Palace, who did us the Ho∣nour
to be a Spectator of our Entrance from a
Balcony, both sides of the River being lined
with an infinite number of People, who by
their Joyfull Acclamations, gave us sufficient de∣monstrations
of the Joy they conceived at our
happy Arrival in the Port of <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Port of Lisbon.</HEAD>
<P>I Stay'd six whole Months at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to satisfie my
Curiosity in taking a full view of this large and
Beautiful City. I had the honour to be acquain∣ted
with the Sieur <HI>Fabre,</HI> chief Physician to the
Queen of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who is in great esteem not on∣ly
with this Princess, but also among all the Gran∣dees
of the Kingdom. He was so obliging as to
offer me his House, and I must freely acknow∣ledge,
that I received during my stay in this City,
so many kindnesses and obligations from his hands,
that the only way left me to repay them, is to
confess ingeniously that they are so many as to
put me into despair of ever being able to retaliate
them, unless it be by a perpetual acknowledge∣ment.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that <HI>Lisbon</HI> is much frequen∣ted
by Strangers, and that such as have not had
the opportunity to go thither in person, may easily
be instructed concerning this great City, out of se∣veral
Books that treat of it in particular, never∣theless.
I hope it may not be unacceptable, if I say
something here as it were en passant, of a City, where
I stay'd six whole Months.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tagus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Lisbon.</HI></NOTE> by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> called <HI>Tejo,</HI>
is very famous both for its largeness, and the Gold
which is drawn out of its Sands. It waters several
goodly Provinces, and runs directly under the
Walls of the City of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where is one of the best
Harbours in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="123"/>
This River is Situate under the 39th and 40th
Degrees of North Latitude. Its Entrance is to be
seen far off at Sea by the Mountain called by the
<HI>Portugueses La Roqua.</HI> As you pass the Bar you must
be very careful to avoid the Sand Banks that are
on the South side.</P>
<P>Before you come up to the City of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> you
see the strong Fort and Town of <HI>Cascais.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort of <HI>Cascais.</HI></NOTE> This
place is about 5 Leagues distant from the Capital
City, is always provided with a good Garrison,
and has a Port capable of containing Ships of a
great Bulk, but they don't ride very safely here,
if the Wind blows hard at West or South West.
<HI>Cascais</HI> is dignified with the Title of a Marquisate,
belonging to one of the greatest Lords of the King∣dom.
Near this place is the Bar of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where
it is dangerous passing, if you are not provided
with a good Pilot, abundance of Ships having
been lost here for want of such guides as were well
acquainted with this passage.</P>
<P>About two Leagues beyond <HI>Cascais</HI> there are two
Forts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other Forts.</NOTE> one whereof is Built upon Piles in the
midst of the River; the <HI>Portugueses</HI> call it <HI>a Torre
de Bougio;</HI> the other is the Fort of St. <HI>Gian,</HI> or
St. <HI>Julian;</HI> both these Forts are provided with
good Garrisons and a good Artillery, all the Ships
that either enter or go out of the Port of <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
being obliged to pass within the reach of their Can∣non.</P>
<P>Half ways betwixt these two Forts and the City
is the Castle of <HI>Belem</HI> or <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> It is Built in the
River, which is but narrow in this place. This
Castle is as carefully guarded as the rest, and here
it is that the Officers of the Custom-House visit
all the Ships, going out of the Port, to see whe∣ther
they are discharged at the Custom-House, be∣fore
they come away.</P>
<P>Near this Castle upon the very Banks of the Ri∣ver,
there is a very large Town, where the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps
as they are going out are forced to come to an
Anchor, to stay for their last discharge from the
<PB N="216" REF="124"/>
Officers of the Custom-House within the Adjacent
Castle. It is a very Populous place, and affords
all manner of refreshment to such Ships as come
there to an Anchor.</P>
<P>There is in this place a Convent belonging to
the <HI>Bernardin</HI> Friars, one of the finest in the whole
Kingdom. It is called <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> (having given
its Name to the Adjacent Castle, and the Town it
self) being Consecrated to the Memory of the
Birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ. It was Foun∣ded
by <HI>Don Manuel,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> under whose
Reign the <HI>East-Indies</HI> were first discovered by the
<HI>Portugueses.</HI> In the Church are to be seen several
Tombs, and very Magnificent <HI>Mausolaeum's</HI> of the
Kings and Queens of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side of the River directly opposite
to the Convent of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> you see a very large
Structure, where such Ships as come from any
places suspected to be infected with the Plague,
are obliged to unload their Goods, and to keep
their Quarantain all along the River side. Betwixt
<HI>Bethlehem</HI> and the City, you see very pleasant Coun∣try
Houses, which afford a very delightful Prospect
to such as pass along the River.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the City of Lisbon.</HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>Lisbon</HI> is the ordinary Residence
of the Kings of <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">City of <HI>Lisbon.</HI></NOTE> is one of the finest
and richest Cities in all <HI>Europe,</HI> which affords eve∣ry
thing that is most rare and precious in Foreign
Countries. It contains 7 Hills within the Precinct
of its Walls, on one of these Hills is Built the
Castle. There are abundance of fine Churches in
<PB N="217" REF="124"/>
this City, among which, that of the <HI>Jacobin</HI> Fri∣ars
excels all the rest.</P>
<P>In one of the Chapels of this Church is an Altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Chur∣ches.</NOTE>
where a Crucifix of an inestimable value of Relieve,
is enclosed in an Iron Grate, with the Wound in
our Saviour's Side; it is daily exposed to publick
view, there being constantly kept 6 white Wax
Candles, and 7 Lamps burning before it. The
great Chapel belonging to the Cathedral is also a
most magnificent Structure.</P>
<P>In a Convent called <HI>a Madre de Deos,</HI> there is to
be seen the Handkerchief of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, which most precious Relick is shew'd to
the people every Holy <HI>Friday</HI> in the After∣noon.</P>
<P>The Streets of <HI>Lisbon</HI> are generally very narrow,
there being very few but such as have been lately
Built, which are passable for Coaches, and I sup∣pose
it is upon this account that Chairs and Lit∣ters
are so much used in this City.</P>
<P>The Royal Palace is Built upon the very Bank
of the River. The grand Place-Royal faces this
Castle, called by the <HI>Portugueses, Tereriro de Paco,</HI>
where they run at the Ring, and keep their Bull-fightings.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Lisbon</HI> several good Market-places,
and other large and fine Squares; abundance of
stately Buildings, and a great number of Fountains,
which are to be seen all over the City, and serve
both for an Ornament to the City, and for the con∣veniency
of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> are very cautious in following
the <HI>French</HI> Fashion in their Dresses. The <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Women are very little, but well shap'd. Ladies
of Quality appear abroad with their Faces unco∣vered,
the rest wear Veils, but they have a way
of opening them, when they have a Mind to be
seen.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">My Departure from Lisbon and return into
France.</HEAD>
<P>AFter I had made the best Observations I could
concerning every thing I thought worth taking
notice of in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> I took Shipping in a Vessel,
which was bound to <HI>Bayonne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>We weighed Anchor from before the Castle of
<HI>Bethlehem</HI> on the 22d of <HI>July,</HI> and the next day
got out to Sea; but the Wind turning about, and
it blowing very hard all the following Night, our
Mizen Mast Split, so that we were forced to make
towards the Shoar to refit.</P>
<P>We came to an Anchor the next day in the Port
of <HI>Cascais,</HI> where the Sieur <HI>Du Casso,</HI> an Inhabitant
of <HI>Bajonne</HI> and I went a-shoar, we continued there
till the 28th of the same Month, when we took
Shipping again, and got out at Sea a second
time.</P>
<P>But the Wind Steering about soon after we were
fain to keep at a great distance from the Shoar;
so we doubled the Cape of <HI>Finistre</HI> the 4th of
<HI>August,</HI> and Sailed along the Coast of <HI>Spain</HI> till
the 15th of the same Month, when we got sight of
our Native Shoar, and at the same time of a Vessel
that was making all the Sail she could towards
us.</P>
<P>We having no more than 25 Men, and 6 Guns
on Board, we thought it our best way to change
our Course; but whilst we were flying from our
supposed Enemy, we soon got sight of another,
which made us alter our Resolution, and to pursue
<PB N="219" REF="125"/>
our former course, which we did accordingly, but
so near the Shoar, that we might have an opportu∣nity
of running our Vessel on Shoar, if we should
be constrained so to do. Thus we Sailed all the
Night, surrounded with terrible apprehensions both
of the danger of the Shoar and our Enemies, but
by Day-light seeing but one of the Ships that were
in pursuit of us the day before, and finding our
selves not far off of the River of <HI>Bayonne,</HI> we made
all the sails we could, and happily entred it the
same Night. Thus after 10 Years Absence, and a
Thousand dangers and fatigues, the necessary con∣sequences
of long Voyages, I had the satisfaction
to set once more foot on Shoar, the 16th day of
<HI>August,</HI> in my Native Country, <HI>France.</HI></P>

Peculiar to the

AND THEIR
REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Vomiting.</HEAD>
<P>VOmiting is the first inconveniency Travel∣lors
are afflicted with at Sea, it is caused
partly by the motion of the Ship, partly by
the change of the Air.</P>
<P>Vomiting as common as it is, is sometimes not
without danger. I have seen some people of a ten∣der
Constitution weakned by it to that degree, that
<PB N="224" REF="128"/>
they were in no small danger of their Life, by the
great loss of Spirits. Others I have seen, who for
3 or 4 Months together have not been able to stir
out of their Beds.</P>
<P>To prevent in some measure the violent Vomit∣ting
at Sea, it is very convenient to take 2 or 3
proper Purges, a little before you go to Sea, espe∣cially
if you have not lived very regularly before.
When you are at Sea, you may mitigate the vio∣lence
of it, if you keep your self quiet betwixt
Decks, for the first 4 or 5 days of your Voyage,
but not to abstain from Eating and Drinking, tho'
you should bring it up again immediately after;
for, if you Vomit with a full Stomach, you don't
strain so violently as you do when it is empty,
when violent Vomitings cause often very dange∣rous
<HI>Haemorrhagies.</HI></P>
<P>It is of great moment, to feed at first upon no∣thing
but what is of very easie Digestion and good
nourishment, to drink but little Wine, and to ab∣stain
as much as possible can be from Brandy or
Aqua vitae, it having been found by Experience
that strong Liquors are so far from fortifying the
Stomach upon this occasion, that they are rather
very hurtful.</P>

<PB N="225" REF="128" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Scurvy, call'd by the French,
The Land-Evil.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scurvy, call'd by the <HI>French</HI> Mariners,
the Land Evil, is the most dangerous and trou∣blesome
of all those Distempers, which are inci∣dent
to those that undertake great Voyages; it
being not only contagious, but also scarce ever to
be cur'd till you get ashoar.</P>
<P>The general Causes of this Distemper are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the Scurvy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sea.</NOTE> the
Sea Air, the Salt Provision, both which cause great
alterations in the Blood; Melancholy, occasioned
by the tediousness, and other Inconveniencies of
long Voyages; Thirst, the common Companion
of those who are to pass into the Eastern-Parts,
and that commonly at such a time when they stand
most in need of Refreshment. And last of all,
the Nastiness of the Mariners, who seldom keep
themselves clean and neat.</P>
<P>For which reason it is, that the Officers, and o∣thers
above the common Rank on board these
Ships, are not so much subject to the Scurvy as
the common Sea-men, because they are better
provided with change of Linen, and feed upon
such things as are of a better Digestion and Nou∣rishment.</P>
<P>The first Symptoms of the Scurvy, appear most
commonly in the Mouth and Gums, which swell,
grow black, and emit a very ill Scent, so that you
are obliged to make very deep Incisions, and some∣times
to take away a considerable quantity of cor∣rupted
Flesh and Matter, which not only loosens
<PB N="226" REF="129"/>
the Teeth, but also often makes them fall out.</P>
<P>This Distemper discovers it self also frequently
by certain black Spots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Sym∣ptoms and Signs.</NOTE> which appear upon the
Arms, Legs and Thighs, and last of all over the
whole Body; and it is to be observed, that, the
broader these Spots are, and nearer the Heart,
the more dangerous is the Distemper.</P>
<P>This Corruption of the Gums, and the breaking
out into Blotches is commonly preceded, or im∣mediately
follow'd by a nauseousness in the Sto∣mach,
a Laziness by fainting and swooning Fits,
pains in the Head, Arms and Legs, and a Loose∣ness,
but seldom by any Fever, I having often
observed, that the Pulse commonly appears very
little declining from its natural State and Mo∣tion.</P>
<P>The Blood being (for Reasons above-alledged)
rendred thick and terrestrious, do's not circulate
freely in the lesser Vessels, which are spread in the
Gums, the extremities of our Bodies, and all
over our Skin; so that its motion ceasing in those
parts, they are depriv'd of their usual supply of
Spirits; what wonder is it if the coagulated Blood
go's into a Corruption, from whence proceed
those Tumors and Blotches; And as the said Cor∣ruption
is augmented in proportion, and commu∣nicated
to other parts, the circulation of the Blood
is by degrees also obstructed in the larger Vessels;
from whence proceed those violent Symptoms,
but especially those frequent Swoonings, which
are commonly the fore-runners of Death.</P>
<P>To prevent this <HI>Evil</HI> so destructive to Mariners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Precaution against the Scurvy.</NOTE>
the Officers, to whose management the Ship is
committed; ought, before their Embarquement
to take effectual care that their Ships be Victuall'd
with good and sound Provision, that the Biscuits
be not mouldy, or the Victuals tainted, which is
too frequently practised, to the great detriment
of the whole Ships-Crew, when either the Cap∣tain
dares not contradict those who have the Victu∣alling
of the Ship, or when out of covetousness
<PB N="227" REF="129"/>
he shares with others the Profits arising by this
Malversation.</P>
<P>When they are out at Sea, the Officers belong∣ing
to the Ship ought to be very careful to have
her kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neat and clean, to cause her to be
well swept, and wash'd with Sea-Water every day,
and to be sprink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d and sweetn'd two or three
times a Week with good strong Vinegar, which
purifies the Air, and renders it more subtil and
thin.</P>
<P>Each particular Person on board the Ship ought,
as far as is possible, provide himself with the Juice
of Citrons, Limons, Ros solis, preserv'd and dry'd
Fruits, but especially with good Store of Prunes;
to abstain as much as can be, from all sorts of
Meat, which are in the least tainted, from Salt-Flesh
and Fish, unless they be well fresh'd out; to
feed much upon Rice, Barley and Prunes, drink
Wine mix'd with Water, and not to abstain from
drinking if you be thirsty, unless it be in case of
the highest necessity; to change frequently your
Linen, and to wash often your Mouths and the
whole Body, to cleanse it from all the Filth and
ill Scents, which are engendred by the continual
Sweats, and which hindring the insensible Transpi∣ration,
do not a little contribute towards the pro∣duction
of the Scurvy.</P>
<P>But if a body be already seiz'd with this pernici∣ous
Disease, which will soon appear by the swel∣ling
and blackness of the Gums, no time ought
to be neglected to stop the progress of this Evil,
which in a little time will spread all over the Bo∣dy.
If it be in a plethorick and vigorous Body,
it will not be amiss to lett a little Blood, to facili∣tate
the circulation of the <HI>Blood;</HI> but this ought
not to be done in great quantity, for fear of im∣pairing
the Patient's Spirits, who in this Distem∣per
stands in need of all his strength to support
him against his Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="130"/>
Some days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedies against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rvy.</NOTE> you may make use of a gentle
Purge, but above all, you ought frequently to
apply Clysters, if you have conveniency to do it▪
but this is sometimes not to be put in practice, by

<P>It is of great help to those who are afflicted vvith

to keep them up close and very vvarm, Svveating

<P>MAlignant Fevers are not frequent in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
but the simple continual Fevers are
much in vogue. Among the intermitting Fevers,
the <HI>Tertians</HI> and double <HI>Tertians</HI> are the most com∣mon;
and as their Cure is very difficult in those
Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Italian <HI>Physicians.</HI></NOTE> so they prove often mortal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pagan</HI> Physicians, whom they call <HI>Pandites,</HI>
are a sort of People without Learning or any
Knowledge or insight into Anatomy. All their
Skill is confin'd to a certain number of Receipts,
which they have receiv'd by Tradition from their
Ancestors; these they apply promiscuously, with∣out
making the least Alteration, as often as they
meet with a Patient af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licted with the same Di∣stemper,
against which their Receipt was intend∣ed,
<PB N="233" REF="132"/>
without making the least reflection upon the
different Age, Sex, Constitution, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Strength of
their Patients. They are very timorous, and ra∣ther
will let a Patient perish than run the hazard
of a Remedy, which, as they believe, not being
sufficiently approved by experience, appears
doubtful to them, though they judge the Di∣stemper
to be mortal, or incurable without it.</P>
<P>Nevertheless it is observable, that by their long
experience they have made such Observations con∣cerning
certain Distempers peculiar to those
Countries, that they practise with better success
than the most learned foreign Physicians, who up∣on
certain occasions must follow their footsteps,
if they expect to succeed in their Cures in this
Climate.</P>
<P>They never allow their Patients afflicted with
any kind of Fever in the <HI>Indies,</HI> neither Meat,
neither Eggs or Broath, this would be as much as
the Patient's life is worth, if they should give
them any of these things. They allow them no
other Drink but fair Water, and for the rest for
their sustenance, they give them a <HI>Cange,</HI> which
is made in the following manner.</P>
<P>They beat about half a Pound of Rice in two
or three quarts of Water, which they boil so long,
till the Rice be well broken, which is commonly
done in an hours time. Then they strain it thro'
a Linen-Cloth, and squeeze it well to draw out
all the goodness from the Rice; of this they give
a Spoonful at a time, four or five times a day to
the Patient, making it always warm, and putting
a little Salt into it, to make it the more savory.
I shall have occasion to tell you anon, upon what
occasion they put Pepper into this <HI>Cange.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Cange</HI> besides that it nourishes well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cange</HI> of the <HI>In∣dians.</HI></NOTE> serves
also to squench the Thirst; I must confess I prefer
this much before our Jelly-Broaths, it coming
much nearer to the Diets prescribed us by the an∣tient
Physicians in these cases, than what is used
<PB N="234" REF="133"/>
now a-days in <HI>France,</HI> rather by the connivance
than the approbation of the Physicians.</P>
<P>For, is it not very strange to see a sick body to
take more Nourishment, whilst he is sick, than
perhaps he used to do when he was in Health? It
being beyond all question, that Jelly-broath taken
perhaps seven or eight times a day, and new-laid
Eggs, which we give our Patients, contain more
Nourishment, and produce a greater quantity of
pure Chyle than a moderate quantity of Bread
and Meat, which is the ordinary Food of People,
when they are in good Health.</P>
<P>Besides this, the <HI>Cange</HI> has also this Excellency,
that it causes no aversion in the Patient, which is
the general Inconveniency in these strong Broths,
which being taken with so much Repugnancy,
can scarce be supposed to produce any good effect.</P>
<P>If it be a continual Fever, they allow them no∣thing
else but <HI>Cange;</HI> but if it be a <HI>Tertian Ague,</HI>
they allow them betwixt the Fits, to eat a little
Bread and Sweet-Meats; But no kind of Meat or
Eggs, unless it be after the Ague has entirely left
them, and that there is no fear of a Relapse.</P>
<P>Letting of Blood is much used among the <HI>In∣dians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letting of Blood and Cupping.</NOTE>
and that with good Success; the <HI>Pandites,</HI>
being by long Experience, convinc'd of the use∣fulness
of this Remedy, will sometimes let Blood
twenty times one after another, without the least
Reluctancy to be observ'd in the Patient, who
never grumble here at what their Physicians do,
but are exactly observant to their Orders, much
beyond what is practised in most Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI>
where the Patients, their Friends, and the Nurses
propose their own Remedies, before the Physici∣an's
Prescriptions.</P>
<P>They let blood most commonly in the Foot with
extraordinary good Success; and I have made
this Observation, not only in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but also
in all other places which I have visited in my Tra∣vels,
as well as in <HI>France,</HI> that there are few Di∣stempers,
where the letting of Blood in the Foot
<PB N="235" REF="133"/>
proves not more successful than when done in the
Arm.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> prescribe Cupping and Leeches in
those Distempers, where they don't think it pro∣per
to let blood.</P>
<P>Clysters are also much in use among them, they
are composed of <HI>Senna, Cassia</HI> and <HI>Tamarinds,</HI>
and so are their Purges, which have the same ef∣fect
only by two different ways; they mix with
them some Sirups of Simples, to wit: of Cicho∣ry,
Roses, Limons and Maidenhair.</P>
<P>Chymical Preparations are unknown to the
<HI>Pandites;</HI> they are surprised when they see us Fo∣reigners
to produce such Evacuations as we do▪
by the help of such small quantities of Physick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pandites</HI> perceiving the Urine of the Pa∣tient
that is afflicted with a Fever to be white,
they judge it to proceed from a cold Cause, with∣out
having the least respect to the <HI>Delirium</HI> and
other Symptoms, which are the ordinary signs of
this Urine.</P>
<P>For which purpose they put Pepper in the
<HI>Cange,</HI> which they apply to the Patient's Head,
to warm the Brains, which, they say, are too
cold; and for the same reason it is, that they will
not let blood in such a case, before they find the
Urine to be of a high Colour.</P>
<P>I have made it my particular Observation, that
of all those that ever I saw, who were seiz'd with
a <HI>Delirium</HI> before they were let blood, and whose
Urines appear'd thus white in the beginning, very
few escaped with life, unless, by good fortune
they happen'd to light into the hands of some
<HI>European</HI> Physicians, who are better acquainted
with the true cause of this Distemper and its
Symptoms; of which, I cannot forbear to give
you an instance.</P>
<P>I liv'd at <HI>Daman</HI> for several Months, where,
inspite of all the <HI>Pandites</HI> there, who were very
envious at me, I was employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as a Physician in
all the best Families. I had some time before had
<PB N="236" REF="134"/>
under my Cure the eldest Daughter of a certain
Lady of the best Quality in that place, in which
I had succeeded so well, that I receiv'd all the ac∣knowledgment
imaginable from her hands. Ne∣vertheless,
one of her younger Daughters being
fal'n dangerously ill of a continual Fever with a
<HI>Delirium;</HI> the Lady, upon the perswasion of a
certain <HI>Pandite,</HI> who had been a Physician to the
Family a great while, made use of his Prescripti∣ons,
without letting me know any thing of the
matter; But finding her Child grow worse and
worse, she sent to me unknown to the <HI>Pagan</HI>
Physician, desiring my advice concerning her
Daughter. It was the ninth Day, when I was
call'd to her, and finding her Urine of a whitish
colour, and the Fever very high with a violent
<HI>Delirium,</HI> I drew from thence far different Indi∣cations
to what the <HI>Pandite</HI> had done; and having
remonstrated to her Mother the danger of her
Daughter, who was not above seven years of
age, I order'd her to be let blood immediately.
The <HI>Indian</HI> Physician hapning to come in the same
moment, maintain'd in my presence, that the
Fever proceeding from a cold Cause, the young
Lady would infallibly die if she were let blood;
but I laugh'd at the weakness of his Argument,
and my Advice prevailing with the Childs Friends,
she was let blood, and I took from her head the
Pepper mixt with the <HI>Cange,</HI> of which there was
near half a pound, very finely beaten upon the
Childs head; I let her, in all, five or six times
blood, after which the Fever left her, and I con∣summated
the Cure by giving her 2 or 3 Purga∣tions,
contrary to the expectation of the <HI>Pagan</HI>
Physician, who thought her death to have been
infallible.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Distemper call'd, The Indians
Mordechi.</HEAD>
<P>THe Distemper call'd by the <HI>Indians, Morde∣chi,</HI>
is properly no more, than an Indige∣stion,
very frequent among the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose
Stomachs by reason of the violence of the Heats,
and the continual Sweats, are very weak, and
consequently apt to be surfeited; so that some∣times
this Distemper, as slight as it appears at first
sight, is very dangerous, and kills People in a few
hours time, if they are not assisted with proper
Remedies.</P>
<P>Excess in eating and drinking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its causes and Signs.</NOTE> especially of
such things as are not of an easie Digestion, espe∣cially
at Night is the ordinary Cause of this Di∣stemper.
Its signs are, sudden Heat, pains in the
Head, want of rest, with a Fever, <HI>Delirium,</HI> Vo∣miting
and Looseness; the Pulse is strong and un∣even▪
the Urine sometimes red, sometimes white,
but always clear; These signs are not always ap∣parent
in one and the same Subject, but this Di∣stemper
being very acute, and making quick dis∣patch,
it is not advisable to stay till all of them
appear, but by some of them it is easie to guess
at the rest.</P>
<P>The first and chief Remedy to be apply'd to
those whom they imagine to be seiz'd with the
<HI>Mordechi</HI> is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cure.</NOTE> to burn their Feet; This they do
with a red hot Iron of the thickness of a common
Roasting-Spit, wherewith they touch the Feet
<PB N="238" REF="135"/>
of the Patient cross the Ankles, in that part where
it is most callous, and hold it close to the place,
till the Patient begin to cry out, and signifie there∣by
that he begins to be sensible of the Pain, when
it is taken away immediately; which done, they
take a Slipper or some such thing, and give two or
three good Stroaks upon the place, where the Iron
has toucht, which prevents the rising of a Blister,
without any further Application.</P>
<P>This manner of burning with an Iron, as ter∣rible
as it appears at first sight, does not any con∣siderable
to the place where it is apply'd; and I
have seen some walk as freely immediately after,
as if they had not been touch'd with any thing.
It is certain that this Remedy stops the violence of
the <HI>Mordechi,</HI> and oftentimes cures all its Sym∣ptoms
in an instant; and if it happen that the
Fever continue some time after, it never proves
dangerous, and is easie to be cur'd by ordinary
Remedies.</P>
<P>It is also in these Fevers, that the <HI>Indians</HI> put a∣bundance
of Pepper in the <HI>Cange,</HI> which they give
both inwardly to the Patients, and apply it out∣wardly
to their Heads, as we have mention'd it
before. And generally speaking, it is only by
these means and burning under the Feet, they
cure this Distemper, without letting Blood,
which would infallibly prove mortal, if it were
made use of in the beginning of this Distemper.
Neither do they prescribe any Purgations (if there
be occasion for any) till after the most violent
Symptoms are ceased, and that there is no further
appearance of a Fever.</P>
<P>I don't in the least question, but that abundance
of People will look upon this Cure, which is
perform'd by burning the Feet, as ridiculous, and
not fit to be taken notice of, considering there
seems to be so very slender a relation betwixt the
Remedy and the Distemper, for which it is put in
use. I cannot deny, but that at my first coming
into the <HI>Indies,</HI> I was of the same opinion, till
<PB N="239" REF="135"/>
being convinc'd of the truth of it by experience,
I have since that time put it in practice as well up∣on
my self, as a great many others, never with∣out
good success, when all other Remedies,
which I had apply'd to some, in hopes to remove
the cause of this Distemper have proved in∣effectual.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bloody-Flux.</HEAD>
<P>DYsenteries of all kinds are contagious, not
easie to be cur'd, dangerous, and very of∣ten
mortal, not only in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but more fre∣quently
on Ship-board.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are no less subject to this Distem∣per
than the <HI>Europeans;</HI> but the latter are not so
easie to be cur'd as the first, by reason of their
Debaucheries in Wine and <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> which is not
so common among the Eastern Nations.</P>
<P>If the Dysentery has a Fever for its Companion
(which indeed it is seldom without) the <HI>Pandites</HI>
give to the Patients of their <HI>Cange,</HI> and some Rice
very thick boil'd, but without Salt; this they mix
with an equal quantity of curded sowre Milk,
which they praise as the most sovereign Remedy
in the Universe against this Distemper; But
I must confess that I never saw it made use
of, but it prov'd fatal; they let blood in this
Distemper and repeat it frequently; But they
don't make use of any Purgations, nay not so much
as of any Anodyne Clysters, which they say, would
encrease the Evil, but in lieu of them they make
use of Astringents; which as they sometimes stop
the <HI>Flux,</HI> without removing the Cause; so the
Patients by the violence of the Torments, are put
<PB N="240" REF="136"/>
under most intolerable Inquietudes, resting nei∣ther
day nor night; To obviate this, they give
them <HI>Opium</HI> very plentifully, and that without
the least Preparation, sometimes ten Grains for
one Dose.</P>
<P>It can't be deny'd but that the <HI>Indians,</HI> being
accustomed to the use of <HI>Opium,</HI> they can bear a
much greater Quantity than the <HI>Europeans;</HI> ne∣vertheless
I can testifie it, I know very few that
have been cur'd by their <HI>Opium,</HI> as little as by their
other Remedies they make use of in this case.</P>
<P>But if this method commonly proves pernici∣ous
to the <HI>Indians,</HI> it was certainly fatal to such
<HI>Europeans</HI> as trusted themselves to the manage∣ment
of these <HI>Pagan</HI> Physicians; and I do protest
to you, that I never saw any <HI>European</HI> who was
afflicted with the Dysentery, but what died un∣der
their Hands.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe, that those who rightly under
stand the pernicious quality of <HI>Opium,</HI> will give cre∣dit
to what I say; and it was Chiefly upon this ac∣count
that I could never be prevail'd upon to fol∣low
the Method of these <HI>Pagan</HI> Physicians in this
case; I was rather contented that they should call
in those <HI>Pandites,</HI> and take their Remedies from
their own hands, without my Approbation.</P>
<P>Thus it hapn'd to a certain religious Person,
who during my stay on the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI>
being taken dangerously ill of a Dysentery with a
Fever, and finding that the Remedies which I had
prescrib'd did not produce the desir'd effect, he
asked my consent to call in a <HI>Pandite,</HI> which be∣ing
done accordingly, he prescribed the good Fa∣ther
five or six Doses of <HI>Opium,</HI> mixt with Oil
and <HI>Jagre,</HI> or <HI>Suchar</HI> of the <HI>Coco's,</HI> by which
means he sent the Patient to the other World.</P>
<P>It was no small dissatisfaction to me, to find,
that all the Remedies I apply'd in this case, did
not answer the desir'd Effect, which raised in me
an extraordinary desire, of finding out such a me∣thod,
as might effectually answer my expectation▪</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="136"/>
I had observed among the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> that they
prescribed only <HI>Cange,</HI> Rice, Bread, and Chaly-beat-water
in the <HI>Bloody-Flux,</HI> and that, after
some gentle Purgations, they made use of <HI>Astrin∣gent
Medicines,</HI> entirely rejecting the use of the
Curds and of <HI>Opium</HI> of the <HI>Pandites.</HI> This Method
I must confess, as it appears more reasonable, so
I thought it must be more secure than that used by
the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>But this not giving me all the Satisfaction I
could wish for in this case, I got at last, by good
fortune, acquainted with a certain Person, who
having liv'd for many years together in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
taught me a certain Preparation, which is as
easily taken as prepared, by the help of which,
and certain Rules to be observed in the manage∣ment
of the Diet, I have cur'd a great many Per∣sons
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> on Ship-board, and in <HI>France,</HI>
after my return from the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be deny'd, but that the <HI>Flux</HI> may
proceed from different Causes, and that therefore
there ought to be a suitable Change to be observ'd,
both in relation to the Remedy and Diet, but
this being no difficult task for a Physician, who
understands the true nature and cause of a Di∣stemper;

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Distemper'd Persons, call'd by
the Portugeses, Esfalfados.</HEAD>
<P>YOU meet frequently in the <HI>Indies,</HI> with a sort
of sick People, call'd by the <HI>Portugeses, Es∣falfados;</HI>
they are such as have wasted all their
natural Strength and Vigour, by the accesses of
Debauchery with Women; which frequently hap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns
in a Climate, whereby the continual Sweats,
occasioned by the excessive heats, there is a con∣stant
Dissipation of our Spirits; which is evident
in the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose Bodies being accustomed to
the Climate, are seldom subject to this Distemper,
tho' it must be also confess'd that they are much
more moderate in this point than the <HI>Portugeses.</HI></P>
<P>The cause of this Distemper is, what I have al∣ledged
just now; Its signs are, great Droughts,
Heats, Inquietudes, a continual Fever, with a
nauseous sme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in the Stomach; The Pulse beats
uneven, sometimes very high, and by and by so
low as to be sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e discernable; Their Urine is red
but clear.</P>
<P>This being a common Distemper in those parts,
which if treated like other Fevers, would doubt∣less
prove fatal. A Physician therefore when
call'd to a Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient, ought to act with a great deal
of circumspection, for fear of committing a mis∣take,
not to be repair'd afterwards, by all his Skill;
For which reason he ought very strictly to exa∣mine
his Patient concerning his former course of
Life, especially if it be a young body, who per∣haps
is unwilling to discover his Faults in the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence
<PB N="243" REF="137"/>
of his Friends, or Parents. For this Fever,
without duly pondering all the circumstances, may
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceive the most expert Physician, I having known
Examples of those that died of this Distemper,
because they were but once let blood.</P>
<P>The chief Indication of the whole Cure con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ists
in restoring the decayed strength and spirits of
the Patient, which is best to be done by giving
him Meats of an easie Digestion, and of good
Nourishment; as good Jelly Broths, New-laid
Eggs, and other Meats prepared with all sorts of
good Gravies. Let them drink good Wine, mix'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess or more with Water, according as they were
used to drink it, when they were in health; but
let them by no means drink common Water or
Barley Water, for fear that the abovementioned Di∣et
should augment the Fever, it being so far from
it, that it will certainly remove it.</P>

<P>IN the <HI>Indies</HI> they know no other Plague or In∣fectious

are as contagious there as in <HI>Europe,</HI> and tho' one
might suppose them to be less dangerous in a Cli∣mate,
where the Pores of our Bodies being always

<P>The <HI>Malabars</HI> use those infected with this Di∣stemper
more cruelly than any others of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bitings of the Adders.</HEAD>
<P>AMong the several kinds of Adders, which are
to be found in the <HI>Indies,</HI> some are of so per∣nicious
a nature, that, whenever they infect any
Person, he dies in an instant, without the least
hope of relief. Of this kind are the green ones,
of which I have spoke before, when I treated of
the Coast of <HI>Malabar.</HI> The Poyson which issues
<PB N="245" REF="138"/>
from the rest, being not altogether of so quick an
operation, give one sometimes leisure to obviate
the Evil by proper Antidotes.</P>
<P>They make use in the <HI>Indies,</HI> of a certain Stone,
which they say, is found in the Heads of some
Adders, and for that reason is call'd by the <HI>Portu∣geses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ad¦der-sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>
<HI>Pedra de Cobre,</HI> or Adders Stone. This
they apply to the place where the Adder has fixed
her Poyson, where the Stone fastens it self, with∣out
any other help, and having suck'd in as much
of the Poyson, as it is able to contain, it falls off;
Then they put it in Milk, where having discha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g'd
the Poyson it had attracted before, it is apply'd
afresh in the same manner, as before, till such time
that it will not fasten no longer, which is an evi∣dent
sign, that the Poyson is removed, and the
Danger past.</P>
<P>It is observable, that when this Stone is put in
Milk to discharge the Poyson, the Milk appears
as if Excrements had been put into it, and
of several Colours. I have been frequently an
eye-witness of the stupendious effects of this
Stone; but the worst is, that it is a great Rarity
to meet with a good one, there being abundance
of Counterfeit ones, who have not the same
Vertue.</P>
<P>If it therefore happen that any one be bitten
by an Adder, and you have not any of these
true Stone, at hand, the best way is to have that
part where the Wound is, scarified, and by the
help of Cups to draw as much Blood from thence
as you can; afterwards apply to the place such Re∣medies,
as have a peculiar Vertue to attract Poy∣son,
from the Center of the Body to it Circum∣ference.
For which purpose it is convenient, to
keep the Wound open for a considerable time, to
use Juice of Citrons or Limons, in every thing
you eat, drink Wine, and take inwardly the true
Powder of Vipers, provided it may be had una∣dulterated.
These are, in my Opinion, the most
proper Antidotes to be made use of, upon such an
occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="139"/>
The Poyson of these pernicious Creatures being
so volatile, and of so subtil a nature, as to be
soon conveyed to the Heart, many times before
it is possible to apply proper Antidotes, a great
many die miserably for want of present Conveni∣ency
to obviate the Evil, before it siezes their Vi∣tals.</P>
<P>It is upon this score, that we have seen some of
the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were sensible of their present
danger on such an occasion, cut off themselves im∣mediately
that Member which they knew to be
infected by the Poyson. Of this I remember an
instance in a certain <HI>Naher,</HI> during my stay at
<HI>Tilcery.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman being a little overcome by the
<HI>Tary</HI> or Palm-tree Wine, found one of these small
green Adders, (the most pernicious kind of all)
which he took by the Tail, and play'd with her so
long, till she found means to bite him in the Fin∣ger.
The <HI>Naher,</HI> notwithstanding he was in
drink, being sensible of the present danger of
loosing his Life, kill'd the Adder, and in an in∣stant
cut off his Finger.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Distemper, call'd by the Por∣tugeses,
Bicho.</HEAD>
<P>THE Word <HI>Bicho,</HI> signifies in the <HI>Portugese</HI>
Language as much as an Earth-worm, or a
small Creature; besides which the <HI>Portugueses</HI> use
it for three several sorts of Distempers, peculiar
to the Inhabitants of the Coast of <HI>Brasil.</HI></P>
<P>The first is occasioned by a certain kind of a
Worm, long and pretty thick, which being en∣gendred
in the Legs, causes most cruel Pains, af∣terwards
<PB N="247" REF="139"/>
very sordid Ulcers, and last of all, an
incurable Gangrene, if you don't prevent it in
time; by opening the Skin where it lies, from
whence you may draw out the Worm by winding
of it gradually round a large Needle or small
Sticks, but very gently, for fear of tearing the
Worm in pieces, in which case you must make a
large Incision, to take out the remaining part;
The Worm being remov'd, you may apply com∣mon
Detergents to the Ulcer, and afterwards Ci∣catrise
it, after the ordinary way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bicho</HI> of the second kind is a Worm, but
so small, as it is impossible to be seen by the most
clear-sighted. They are in great quantities in rui∣ned
Houses, as well as new Buildings, and among
Excrements and Dust.</P>
<P>They enter insensibly thro' the Pores of the
Skin, especially in the Feet, insinuate themselves
betwixt the Flesh and Skin, and will sometimes
settle under the Nails. The <HI>Negro's</HI> and <HI>Brasilians,</HI>
who go bare-footed, are often troubled with
them, and the <HI>Europeans,</HI> tho' they commonly
wear Shoo's and Stockins, are not always free
from this Mischance. These small Worms, don't
cause any immediate Pain; on the contrary, it is
a great while before you are sensible of them, un∣less
you carefully look upon your feet every day.
But they soon increase in your Skin, and in four∣teen
or fifteen days time, grow as big as a Pea,
and do easily discover themselves by their black
Colour. The safest way is, to take them out as
soon as you are sensible of them; for the longer
they remain in the Skin, the more difficult they
are to be taken out; and, if they are there long
enough, they will cause a Corruption, which pro∣duces
such malignant Ulcers, that I have seen of∣tentimes
<HI>Negro's,</HI> to have the Flesh of their Feet
corrupted in so miserable a manner, that the bare
Bones appear'd.</P>
<P>It is next to an impossibility to avoid catching of
these Worms: The only way is to take care not to
<PB N="248" REF="140"/>
let them settle long in the Skin; for if they be
taken in time, they are not attended with any
considerable ill consequences. If they have caused
any Corruption or Ulcers, they may be cur'd after
the common way, after you have taken out the
Worms, or have kill'd them with Tobacco-pow∣der.
Besides this, the <HI>Portugeses,</HI> living on the
Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> are pester'd with another Distem∣per,
which they call <HI>Bicho;</HI> This is an Inflama∣tion
in the Fundamental, which as it is very com∣mon,
so it is no less dangerous in this Country;
Heat-aches and Burning-heats in the affected part,
being the constant companions of these Inflama∣tions,
which are often not without a Fever; and
if neglected, produce in a few days time very
malignant Ulcers, from whence this Distemper
has gotten the name <HI>Bicho.</HI></P>
<P>Such as keep these parts clean by washing them
often with fair Water only, are less subject to this
Evil, than such as do otherwise. As soon as you
find your self siez'd by this Distemper, bath it
oftentimes a day with a Decoction made of Li∣mons,
and mix with it a little Salt. You may al∣so
put with good success Slices of Limons within
your Fundament, which often cures the Distem∣per
without any more ado, if you take it in the
beginning. But if it be already gone into a Cor∣ruption,
they used to dilate some Gun-powder
with a sufficient quantity of Rose or Plantain-Water,
in which Liniment they dip some Linen-Rags,
which they put in the Fundament, not neg∣lecting
to bath it before with the Decoction of Li∣mons.
Special care is to be taken, that if a Fever
appear in this case, not to let blood, it having
been found by Experience, that it has always
prov'd prejudicial. It is much more safe to keep
constant to Anodyne and Detersive Clysters, ac∣cording
as the Corruption or Inflammation is more
or less, and to conclude the whole Cure with a
gentle Purge.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Isle of St▪ Helens.</HEAD>
<P>THE Isle of St. <HI>Helens</HI> is situate under the
<HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> at sixteen degrees of Southern
Latitude, having but one Landing-place,
to wit, In that Part where the <HI>English</HI> have their
Fort. Its Circumference is of about five Leagues,
being surrounded with unaccessible Rocks; You
enter, or rather climb up to the Island, just near
the Fort, by many Steps, near a Mile high, from
whence a Soldier had broke his Neck, a few Weeks
before, as he was going up, this being the only
<PB N="4" REF="142"/>
Person that died there in six years before; The
Air was extreamly wholesome here, the heat of
the Sun being allay'd by the continual Dews and
small Rains.</P>
<P>It is a very fruitful Island, affording good store
of Pease, Beans, Reddishes, Turneps, Cabbages,
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ana's, Banana's, Citrons, Oranges, Melons and
Pomegranates. The <HI>English</HI> told us, that Vines
would not thrive in this Island. There is also a
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odigious Quantity of Rats, who consume all
the Wheat and Rice that is sow'd. They have
great plenty of Rabbits. They have several times
transported some Horses thither, but they grew so
wild in a little time, that they would let no body
come near them; and if they were pursu'd and
driven into a Corner, they would rather precipi∣tate
themselves from the Rocks that surround the
Island, into the Sea, than suffer themselves to
be catch'd.</P>
<P>There are also good Patridges, and some other
sorts of wild Fowl; so that they enjoy here all
the Conveniencies of Human Life, were it not
for these Rats, which being their only redoubta∣ble
Enemies, the <HI>English</HI> endeavour by all means
possible, to extirpate from this Island, which be∣longs
to the <HI>English East-India</HI> Company. The
Inhabitants live upon Biscuit, Oil, and Salt-Beef,
besides what their own Grounds furnish them with∣al.
Most of them have their settled Habitations
in the Island, and only come at certain times, in
their turns, to do duty in the Fort.</P>
<P>This Island affords a very delightful Prospect at
a great distance at Sea, by reason of the vast height
of the Rocks, which appearing at nine or ten
Leagues distance, seem to out-brave the force of
the whole Ocean.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Description of the Isle of Teneriffe.</HEAD>
<P>THE Isle of <HI>Teneriffe</HI> is about eighteen Leagues
long, and ten broad. The Principal Fort,
which lies under the eight and twentieth degree,
has four Bastions, which commands the adjacent
Town, call'd <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> where is the safest Land∣ing
in the whole Island.</P>
<P>Towards the North on the Sea-side, there are
three other small Forts, and on the South-side an∣other
Fort, built in the nature of a Castle with
round Towers. Betwixt the Sea-side and the
Town, there are two small Forts, which defend
the Passage that leads to the City. There are in
the place three Monasteries, belonging to the <HI>Ja∣cobines,
Carmelites</HI> and <HI>Austin</HI> Friars, as many
Nunneries, and a Cathedral very handsomly built.</P>
<P>About two Leagues from <HI>Lagona,</HI> there issues
out of a Mountain a very large Spring, on both
sides of which are very high Trees, who by the
thickness of their Leaves, keep the Sun-beams
from heating the Water, which is extreamly cool
near the Spring. The circumjacent Hills were
stor'd with Orange, Citron, and Pomegranate
Trees, the Fruits of which cover'd the Grounds
where they stood, on the foot of the Mountain,
is seen a very pleasant Wilderness, near one side
of which, the Water of the Spring fell from the
descent of the Hill, with a pleasing noise, and
gathering below in a Channel, run with an easie
current for a League and a half thro' the adjacent
Plains. From hence it was by a large Aqueduct,
<PB N="6" REF="143"/>
about half a League in length, conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d till
within two hundred Paces distance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
which was furnished with fresh Water by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
very large Cisterns with Cocks for the use of
the Inhabitants. There is also near the City <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a Hill a small Lake, surrounded with other Hills,
where the Cattle belonging to the Inhabitants are
furnished with Water.</P>
<P>The People of Quality in the Isle of <HI>Teneriffe,</HI>
are very obliging; But the Vulgar, are here, as
all over <HI>Spain,</HI> very proud and lazy, there being
scarce a Handycrafts-Fellow, but what has his
great Sword on his side, whether at home or a∣broad;
and will rather starve at home, or at the
best rather be contented with Pulse and Roots,
than to go to fetch it from abroad, there being
great store of Wild-Fowl here. The Women wear
Veils, but have a way of squinting through it
with one eye.</P>
<P>Their Wheat is not unlike the Turkey Wheat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣ducts of <HI>Teneriffe.</HI></NOTE>
Malvasier Wine they have in great plenty. A
whole Pipe cost commonly not above twenty Du∣cats.
They pay seventeen Reals for Custom when
it is exported, so that in all it does not amount to
above fourscore and nine <HI>French</HI> Livers; A Pipe
containing four hundred and fourscore pints of <HI>Pa∣ris</HI>
measure, which is above a hundred <HI>English</HI>
Gallons▪ They have here great plenty of Money,
for which reason your Foreign Merchants Trade
hither, with very great advantage.</P>
<P>The chief Commodities to be vended here, are,
Swords, Pistols, Knives, Combs, Cloths, Clokes,
Black and Grey, Broad Hats, Ribons and Linen-Cloaths.</P>
<P>Just opposite to <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> there is another
Harbour, which they call <HI>La Rota,</HI> the rest of this
Island being environ'd by unaccessable Rocks.

<P>THE City of <HI>Fernamboucq</HI> is built upon a Point

call the River <HI>Sallee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Fer∣namboucq.</HI></NOTE> Its figure is Circular, con∣taining

<P>There is a small Island, which being separated
by the abovementioned Branch of the Sea, from
the City, is joyned to it by a long narrow Bridge
sustained by forty five Arches, whereof some are
of Stone, the rest of Wood, the last are built for
the conveniency of the Tide, and the first to serve
as a solid foundation of the whole Fabrick. It is
called St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Island, it contains about a hun∣dred

near the Sea-shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Colombo.</HI></NOTE> being surrounded with a vast
number of fine Trees, which afford a very delight∣ful
Prospect. Just by is a very large Castle very
considerable for its strength. Besides which they
are Masters of <HI>Negombo</HI> and <HI>Japhnepatan,</HI> two very
considerable Cities, and have Fortified all the We∣stern,
Nothern and Southern Coasts of this Island;
as for the Eastern parts, they have, as it seems, neg∣lected
them, because thereabouts grows but little
Cinnamon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> had formerly in their Possession
several Forts in this Island, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
taken from them, and Demolished them. The
<PB N="10" REF="145"/>
two choicest were called <HI>Tinkemale</HI> and <HI>Battecalo,</HI>
situate betwixt the seventh and eighth Degree of
Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>The Last of these two is situate upon a River
disemboguing in a very fair Bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battecalo.</NOTE> where there is ve∣ry
safe riding at Anchor for Ships, who may with∣out
any danger enter the River which is both very
large and deep. On the point of this Bay there
might be built a Fort, which would lie very con∣venient
to Command the Bay.</P>
<P>I am well assured that the King of <HI>Ceylon</HI> would
be willing enough to bestow this tract of ground
upon a Foreign Prince, in case they would assist
him against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who export the Cinnamon
in prodigious Quantities, without paying any Cu∣stoms,
under pretence that they having been at
great Expences to deliver that Island from the <HI>Por∣tugueses,</HI>
they ought to keep such Cities and Forts
as they have taken from the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and (which
by virtue of a Treaty made with the King of <HI>Cey∣lon</HI>
they were to deliver into his hands) in their
possession as a pledge for their money till it be
repaid, and that in the mean while they take the
Cinnamon on discount of the interest.</P>
<P>There might easily a correspondence be setled
betwixt <HI>Battecalo</HI> and the City of <HI>Candie,</HI> the Re∣sidence
of the King of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> being situate in the
very Center of the Island, about two days journey
from <HI>Battecalo,</HI> and as many from <HI>Colombo.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from the City of <HI>Candie,</HI> towards the
side of <HI>Battecalo,</HI> there is a very fine Wood of Cin∣namon
Trees, which hitherto has escaped both the
hands of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> as being so
near the Residence of the King. But it is most
probable that the <HI>Dutch</HI> do not think it worth their
while to put themselves to the charge, of sending
a considerable Force at such a distance, the We∣stern
parts alone abounding so much with Cinna∣mon,
that from thence all the World may be fur∣nished
sufficiently.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Ceylon</HI> has several times offer'd thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Wood to Sale to any foreign power that would

of the best Commodities of his Country, which

This Cinnamon Trade might very well turn to ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Description of the City of Cochin.</HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>Cochin</HI> was formerly a very large
City, but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having burnt down
all the Suburbs and one half of the City,
have enclosed the same now with a very regular
Fortification, containing Nine Bastions, whereof
seven are on the Land-side, two upon the River.
There is still remaining a very strong Tower built
formerly by the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> which serves as a Ca∣stle
to the City.</P>
<P>There is an Artillery of three hundred Pieces of
Cannon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Cochin.</HI></NOTE> as well of Iron as Brass in <HI>Cochin,</HI> a hun∣dred
whereof are ready mounted upon the Basti∣ons.
The Garrison is seldom above three hundred
strong, composed of <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers, which consi∣dering
the large compass of the Fortifications is
but a slender defence, in a place where it may well
be questioned, whether the Inhabitants are altoge∣ther

at their devotion, considering that the <HI>Indians,</HI>
the <HI>Mestices</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> Roman Catholicks,
who without doubt would be willing enough to
shake off the yoak, are six to one of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>There is still a titular King, a native of the
Country at <HI>Cochin,</HI> in whose name all publick bu∣sinesses
are transacted, these people having so strong
an inclination to a Monarchical Government that it
is impossible, to rase out the impression they have
received from their Ancestors concerning the Roy∣al
Authority.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> took <HI>Cochin</HI> from the <HI>Portugueses</HI> in
the year 1662, and perceiving that the King, that
then was, shewed more Inclination for their Ene∣mies,
than for them, they found means to put him
to death with three of his next kindred. Two
Brothers had the good fortune to escape their hands.</P>
<P>The Eldest retir'd to <HI>Carnopoly,</HI> about four days
journey distant from <HI>Cochin,</HI> and his Brother sought
for refuge at <HI>Goa</HI> among the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who gave
him an allowance of four hundred Livers a Month.</P>
<P>The Eldest, whose name was <HI>Godolme,</HI> was the
rightfull Heir of the Kingdom, but the Prince to
whom he was fled for shelter was not in a condi∣tion
to reestablish him in his Throne, neither could
the <HI>Portugueses</HI> pretend to restore him, who had
embraced their Protection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utch</HI> be∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Cochin.</HI></NOTE> unless they could re-take
<HI>Cochin,</HI> and drive the <HI>Hollanders</HI> from thence,
which they were not in a condition to attempt,
these Princes were fain to quit their claim.</P>
<P>To satisfie the common People, the <HI>Dutch</HI> East-India-Company
gave one <HI>Montavy</HI> the Title of
King of <HI>Cochin,</HI> whom they gave an allowance of
a Crown a day, wherewith he was fain to live as
contented as he could in his Palace near <HI>Cochin.</HI></P>
<P>The Streets of this City are very large and hand∣some,
the Houses built of stone after the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Fashion, with fair Balconies. At the end of each
of the Capital Streets are cross Streets, and in the
Center of the City a very large Market place, the
ordinary Rendezvous of the Garrison.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="147"/>
Of twenty three Churches which were built by
the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> there is no more than one left in the
hands of the Roman Catholicks, belonging to the
<HI>Grey-Friars.</HI> The high Altars and all the Chappel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
are finely gilt, and beautified with Pictures. The
Convent which was designed for forty Friars, runs
to ruin, there being but one left now of all the rest,
who most of them took refuge at <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>This Church faces a very large Square, on the
other side of which is the Governour's house built
at the end of an Alley of Coco Trees, planted by
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> since their being Masters of the City.</P>
<P>The Church which formerly belong'd to the <HI>Je∣suits</HI>
is now dedicated to the Divine Service of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Inhabitants, but that which bore the Name
of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s-Church is turned into a Magazine.</P>
<P>Towards the Sea side, are to be seen the ruins of
that Famous Church called <HI>Nostra senhora de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la sa∣vida,</HI>
and nearer to the Fortifications, the Foun∣dation
of one designed to be much bigger than the
other. The rest are entirely demolished, and the
<HI>Dutch</HI> have employed the stones of these Churches
as of the best houses, towards making up their For∣tifications,
which are fac'd with a kind of a red
stone, extreamly hard, which they fetch from a
neighbouring Rock.</P>
<P>In the time of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> there were two
very stately Fountains in the City which have been
ruined by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who make now use of Well
Water only, which is here pretty good.</P>
<P>Every thing is Sold here at an extraordinary

<P>THE Inhabitants near the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope,</HI>
call'd in their Language <HI>Cafres,</HI> or <HI>Hauten∣tottes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inhabitants near the</HI> Cape of Good-Hope.</NOTE>
are all black, both Men and Women
go naked, only covering their privy Parts, with
a piece of an Oxes-hide. It is very rare to meet
here with a Savage who has above one Testicle,
which is always the left, the right being taken out
soon after they are born, this Ceremony being
used among them, as Circumcision is among the
<HI>Mahometans.</HI> The Chiefest among them wear a
kind of a little Cloak, made out of the Skin of
Beasts.</P>
<P>They look upon Blackness as a great Perfection,
and happy is he who is Master of a good old
black earthen Pot or Frying-pan, the out-side of
which serves them to blacken their Faces; which
afterwards they beautifie, (tho' in a most barba∣rous
manner) by making deep impressions in it
with their Nails, in which they put Brick-dust.
Their common Food is the Entrails of Beast. You
seldom meet any of them, without good store of
raw Tripe about them of all sorts of Beasts,
which they look upon as the best Dainty.</P>
<P>They all lead a Vagabond life, roving up and
down in the Fields in the day-time, towards night
<PB N="15" REF="149"/>
they retire to the Mountains or Forests, where
they have their Huts, covered with the Hides of
Beasts▪ near which they keep Fires all night long.
There are not the least footsteps of Religion to be
found among them, unless that they seem to shew
a particular respect to the Fire, when the Sun do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
not app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. It is next to an impossibility to ima∣gine

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tion their manner of living has to the Customs
of other Nations, who have received the least
tincture of Civil Society.</P>
<P><HI>Table-Bay</HI> is near twelve Leagues in Compass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table-Bay.</NOTE>
the Country round about being extreamly fertile
and beautiful. There is very safe riding at An∣chor
here for Ships, which lying under a high
Shoar, are on all sides protected against the vio∣lence
of the Winds. Our Ships rid here at six
Fathoms depth.</P>
<P>Nevertheless is this Bay at certain Seasons pe∣ster'd
with Hurricanes, which they call <HI>Raphales,</HI>
and prove sometimes dangerous, to such Ships as
are surprised by them in the Bay.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> had formerly a Fort here of four
Bastions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort.</NOTE> which defended the entrance of the
Bay; it was very strong, being well pallisado'd
with a deep Ditch round about it, well provided
with Cannon which commanded the Road; The
Commander in chief, and the Factor general used
to live within this Fort, but since they have built
another Royal Fort of five Bastions, being all
fac'd with square Stone, the other has been de∣molished,
and the Seat of the Governour, and
some other of their principal Men has been trans∣planted
likewise from thence to this place.</P>
<P>About two Leagues from the Sea-side, there is
a very fine and richly furnished▪ House belonging
to the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch East-India House.</NOTE> with a very
fair Garden belonging to it, where you might see
all sorts of Herbs and Pulse, and among the rest
Cabbages of a prodigious bigness. Here were
Olive-trees full of Olives, very fine Apples of
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
divers kinds, <HI>Bon Chretien</HI> Pears, Orange and
Chesnut-trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Very good Grapes.</NOTE> all of them either in Blossom, or
stock'd with Fruits. About two Acres of Ground
were enclosed, and planted with Vines, and the
Grapes did not want above a fortnight or three
Weeks to come to perfection. We met with a few
Bunches in this Vineyard, which being pretty ripe,
we tasted of them, but could not give an exact
Judgment of their goodness; but those who had
drunk of the Wine made out of these Grapes,
assured us, that both in taste and goodness, it came
near to the Rhenish Wine.</P>
<P>All round about this House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch <HI>Plantati∣ons.</HI></NOTE> and from thence
quite down to the Sea-side, we saw nothing but
<HI>Dutch</HI> Plantations, the owners whereof held their
Lands from the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Company, pay∣ing
only some small yearly Quit-Rent; besides
which, they were under an obligation to furnish
the Company with a certain Quantity of Wheat
at such a price as they should judge reasonable,
and to truck the Products of their Grounds for
such <HI>European</HI> Commodities as they stood in need
of, and are imported there by the <HI>Dutch East-In∣dia</HI>
Company. They are also forbidden to buy
any thing from the Natives of the Country, for
ready Money, because they should not diminish
their ready Cash; but this precaution seems su∣perfluous,
because these Savages will truck a Mut∣ton
or Cow for a piece of roul'd Tobacco of the
same length as the Beast.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of <HI>Sal∣daigne.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Saldaigne</HI> having been founded, and
visited by Orders from the Commander in Chief
of the <HI>Dutch-Fort</HI> at <HI>Table-Bay,</HI> they reported
that there was very good Anchorage there, and
great store of Fish; that on shoar they had seen
Fallow-Deer, and multitudes of wild Fowl and
Rabbits. That the Sea-Wolves, being thereabouts
to be catch'd in great numbers, might prove a pro∣fitable
Commodity by reason of their Skin, and the
Oil that is drawn from their Flesh. They could
not get sight of any of the Savages there. That
<PB N="17" REF="150"/>
the worst inconveniency seems to be the difficulty
there was of getting fresh Water, there being but
one small Spring near the place, where they could
come to an Anchor, all the rest being six Leagues
distant from thence; and that there was scarce any
Wood thereabouts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Islands in the Bay.</NOTE></P>
<P>They found and visited five Islands within the
Bay, among which, as they judged, two might
be fit to be cultivated, and to be stock'd with In∣habitants

or digg'd Springs of sweet Water. The other three
were so barren, as to be only a proper receptacle

in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Name, with a full
Power to administer Justice, and exercise all other
Acts belonging to the Government in all places
under the King's Jurisdiction (even not except∣ed
the Ecclesiasticks) all there present took
the Oath of Allegiance to the King, and that of
Fidelity to the Sieur <HI>de la Haye.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is acknow∣ledged as Vice-Roy.</NOTE> This done, he
caused immediately a General Amnesty to be pu∣blished,
in which were al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o included the Natives
of the Country, promising absolute Pardon for all
what was past, and exhorting all His Majesty's
Subjects in those Parts, to leave the Service of
Foreigners, and return into the Pay of the <HI>French
East-India</HI> Company, under pain of Death.</P>
<P>Then arising from the Throne, he constituted
the Sieur <HI>de Charmagou,</HI> Lieutenant-General in the
King's Name, and the Sieur <HI>de la Case,</HI> Major of
the Island, of which he took possession in the King's
Name, into whose hands the <HI>East-India</HI> Company
had resign'd it, by reason of the mismanagement
of their Agents and Officers.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de la Haye,</HI> whose Authority was not
limited as the former Governours had been, who
could not undertake any thing of moment with∣out
the approbation of the Directors and the
Council, being resolved to bring under the King's
Obedience the Neighbouring places, proposed to
the Sieurs <HI>de Charmagou,</HI> and <HI>de la Case,</HI> to attack
<HI>Remousaye,</HI> who being the next Neighbour to the
<HI>French,</HI> had refused to do Homage to him.</P>
<P>He had hitherto been an Ally of the <HI>French,</HI>
but having lately married his Daughter to <HI>Rami∣lange,</HI>
their mortal Enemy, the Sieur <HI>de la Haye</HI>
thought it most advisable to thwart the Design of
this new Alliance by an open Rupture.</P>
<P>For which purpose, having demanded from
them all the Arms they formerly had received
from the <HI>French,</HI> and such Fire-locks as they had
lately bought from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, they sent word,
that they were resolved not to part with their
Arms, as long as they had any Life left them.</P>

The Sieur <HI>de la Haye,</HI> having got together a
Body of seven hundred <HI>French,</HI> and six hundred

who behaved himself with great Bravery, and re∣pulsed
the <HI>French</HI> with considerable Loss in several
Attacks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacks the Na∣tives with∣out Success</NOTE> And finding himself not in a Condition
to resist the Fury of his Enemies, he found means
to make an honourable Retreat to a place where
he could not be pursu'd but with a great deal of
difficulty.</P>
<P>The most are of opinion, that the ill Success of
this Enterprise was to be attributed to the Jealou∣sie
there was betwixt the Sieur <HI>de la Haye,</HI> and the
Sieur <HI>de Charmagou,</HI> the last of which not brook∣ing
the Affront of being Commanded in a place,
where he had been Chief before, without question
rendred the whole Design abortive.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de la Haye,</HI> having been convinc'd
by experience that all his Industry, Policy, and
absolute Power stood him in little stead in a place,
where there was a Faction of a contrary Interest,
who directed all their Actions for a far different
End from his Intentions, he thought it most ad∣visable,
to leave the management of this Island to
those, who had contracted a habit of command∣ing
there, long before his arrival in those Parts.</P>
<P>For which purpose, having call'd together all
his Officers and others that were come along with
him from <HI>France,</HI> he ordered them to embarque
on board the Ship under his Command, with
whom he set sail for the Isle of <HI>Mascareigne.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaves</HI> Madagas∣car.</NOTE> about which
they had made such glorious Projects in <HI>France,</HI>
entirely abandoned by the King's Forces, and not
long after by the Company, there being scarce any

antient <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants, and some Missioners,
who resolving to stay behind, were afterwards,
for the most part massacred by the Natives, few
of them escaping into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="152"/>
The Sieur <HI>de la Haye</HI> came to an Anchor near
the Isle of <HI>Mascareigne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes to an <HI>Anchor</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Masca∣reigne.</HI></NOTE> directly opposite to the
<HI>French</HI> Plantation, call'd St. <HI>Denis,</HI> on the first of

of <HI>June</HI> following. In the mean while he caused
the General Amnesty and other Declarations which
he had brought with him from <HI>France,</HI> to be publi∣shed,
among which, there being one against spoil∣ing
the Game, under pain of Death, he ordered a
certain <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, who had been catch'd a
Hunting, to be ty'd to a Tree, in order, as it was
supposed, to have him shot to death. But judg∣ing
the terror of Death to be a sufficient Pu∣nishment
for his Crime, he order'd the Fusileers
that were to do the Execution, to discharge their
Fusees without Ball, which being done according∣ly,
the poor Gentleman was sav'd for that time;
but it seems Death had appear'd to him in so ter∣rible
a shape, that he had frightned him out of his
Life, he dying a few hours after he was taken
from the Tree.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de la Haye</HI> finding his presence no
further necessary in <HI>Mascareigne</HI> took on board
of his own Ship, the Sieur <HI>de Renaud,</HI> who had

for the conveniency of Commerce. There are a∣mong
the other several Sects of the Pagans, some
who call themselves <HI>Persis,</HI> who being descended
from the race of the Ancient <HI>Persians,</HI> that were
driven from their native Country by the <HI>Mahome∣tans,</HI>
do in Imitation of their Ancestors, Adore the
Fire to this day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pagan</HI> Priests or Doctors are called <HI>Bramans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Bra∣man.</NOTE>
some among them pretend to some knowledge
in Philosophy. They are clad in Cotton of a light
reddish colour, but so full of slashes and cuts that
they appear half naked▪ We saw one march at a cer∣tain
time thus through the streets, who being fol∣lowed
by a great number of Women, some among
them who seemed to be more devout than the rest,
wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d run before him, and kneeling down take

hold of his Privy parts to cure them, as we were
informed, of their Barrenness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banjans</HI> are <HI>Pagans</HI> who apply themselves

<P>The City of <HI>Suratte</HI> is Surrounded with a strong
Brick Wall twelve foot thick, each Gate being de∣fended
by two Towers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> The Houses of the com∣mon
People, are built only with Canes and Bran∣ches
of the Palm Tree; Those of the Richer sort
are of Wood and stone, but at the best not above
two stories high, flat on the top with Terrasses, ad∣orned
with flowers and water-works, for the bet∣ter
conveniency and diversion of its Iahabitants, e∣specially
among the <HI>Mahometans.</HI> Their Houses
have very few windows towards the streets, most
of them looking into the Court, they being extra∣vagantly
jealous of their Wives, for fear they should
be too much taken with strangers, of whom there
is here always a great number of all Nations.</P>
<P>They are no less careful of their Treasure, for
which purpose they have, as they have in <HI>Persia,</HI> se∣cret
deep wells, which being covered very artifici∣ally
with large stones, and strengthned with thick
Iron Bars, they hide in them all their most precious
movables, over which they put their Beds, and
make them their ordinary sleeping places.</P>
<P>At one end of the City of <HI>Suratte</HI> upon the very
Banks of the River called <HI>Tapty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle of <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> you see a very
fair Castle with four large Towers of Free-stone,
with a broad Ditch always full of Water. It has
a very good Garrison, no body being permitted to
enter it but those belonging to the Garrison. Every
hour in the day and night, they sound the Trumpet.
The Governour has no dependance on the Gover∣nour
of the City, and never remains in the same
station above three years, when he is re-called by
the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> They are so careful in prevent∣ing
any body from approaching near the Castle,
that they keep constant Centries at fifty paces di∣stance
round about it, for that purpose. The
Prince <HI>Sevagi,</HI> who has several times attack'd and
<PB N="24" REF="154"/>
Plundered the City of <HI>Suratte,</HI> could never make
himself Master of this Castle.</P>
<P>The chief Secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Civil Officers at <HI>Suratte.</HI></NOTE> who depends immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
on the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and is entrusted with all the
Registers and Accounts of what is imported at <HI>Su∣ratte,</HI>
of which he sends from time to time Copies to
Court, is the next in Dignity to the two Gover∣nours
to wit of the City and Castle. There is also
a <HI>Mufti,</HI> whose Office is to take cognisance of all
Religious concerns; A <HI>Cadi</HI> for the interpretation
of the Law; A Judge Criminal, who is invested
with an Authority to punish Criminals, nevertheless
under this limitation, not to inflict a Capital pu∣nishment
upon any without giving an Account of
the nature of the Crime to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and
receiving his approbation.</P>
<P>When he appears abroad he is surrounded by his
Archers well Armed▪ he is Captain of the night
Watch and Patroles round the City, every Night
from nine till three in the Morning. He ought to
be responsible for all Robberies committed within
the Precincts of this great City, but it is very rare∣ly
known that he gives satisfaction for any, very
few of the Inhabitants daring to encounter him up∣on
such an occasion. The Provost who is to take
care of the Circumjacent Country on the same ac∣count,
is also liable to make satisfaction for all Rob∣beries
committed upon the High-ways, but he so
closely follows the footsteps of the Judge Crimi∣nal
in this point, that he seldom makes any repa∣ration
to the losers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> all keep their Heads shaved,
but the <HI>Pagans</HI> look upon their hair as their chief
Ornament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dress of the <HI>In∣dians.</HI></NOTE> All the Subjects of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>
of what Religion soever, wear Turbants and Wast-coats
not unlike our Cassocks over their shirts. The
<HI>Mahometans</HI> make use of streight Drawers, which
reach down to their Ancles, the <HI>Pagans</HI> wear a
kind of a Petticoat; neither of them trouble them∣selves
about Shooes or Stockings, unless that some
of them wear Sandals not unlike our Slippers,
<PB N="25" REF="154"/>
which, among the richer sort, are finely embroi∣dered
with Gold. When they go abroad they
wrap about them a kind of a Toilet in the nature
of a Cloak; some of which are very rich, and
amount to a great price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometan</HI> Women wear very fine Wast-coats
under their Shifts, which are made of Mus∣lin,
and reach only to the Wast; round which
they wrap a piece of Stuff, which comes down
quite to their Feet, one corner of it turning up∣wards
all along the Back, over the Head.</P>
<P>Some of these Ladies, who are of a freer Car∣riage
than the rest, make use of the same Dress
with the Men, except that their Smock-Sleeves,
come but just to the Elbow, their Arms be∣ing
for the rest adorn'd with Bracelets of Dia∣monds,
and Gold, and Silver Locks, and Chains,
which they also wear round their Ankle-bones;
they seldom walk without Pattins, because they
judge it a great advantage to appear tall. They
have Holes both in their Ears and Nostrils, in which
they put Rings. They wear also many of them
on their Fingers, and among the rest, one with a
small Looking-glass in it, which serves them to
contemplate themselves.</P>
<P>The Pagan Women go with their Faces unco∣vered;
but the <HI>Mahometans</HI> never without a Vail.
The <HI>Indian</HI> Women are generally very neat, but
especially in their Hair, which are always very
fine, and dress'd with rich Perfumes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pagan</HI> Women, but especially among the
<HI>Parsis,</HI> are much more careless in their Dress than
the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> but they exceed them in the
richness of their Jewels, their Necklaces, and
Bracelets; they wear also a kind of Cornets upon
their Heads, are for the most part very handsom, and
extraordinary agreeable in Conversation, which is
so Charming, that they seem to be made for the
enjoyment of Love.</P>
<P>I don't know any place where Heremophro∣dites
are more common,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heremo∣phradites.</NOTE> than at <HI>Suratte,</HI> they are
<PB N="26" REF="155"/>
obliged to wear besides their Female Dress, a Tur∣bant,
for distinction's sake.</P>
<P>All the Burying-places are without the Walls of
<HI>Suratte;</HI> Those belonging to the <HI>French, English,</HI>
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> are surrounded with Brick-Walls;
The <HI>Mahometans</HI> have their Sepulchres in an open
Field without any enclosure, and are sometimes
in form of a Pyramide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Se∣pulchres.</NOTE> sometimes of a Cupola,
made of Plaister or Brick; the worst sort being
of a square figure of Stone, not unlike those
which are near <HI>Arles</HI> and <HI>Nismes</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pagan</HI> Clergymen have their separate Bu∣rying-places,
their dead Carcasses being not to be
burnt, no more than those of Children, that die
under two years of Age. The rest of the <HI>Pagan-Indians</HI>
are burnt after their Decease, after they
have been well wash'd in the River <HI>Tapty,</HI> which
they look upon as sacred.</P>
<P>Such Wives as do not burn themselves with
their deceased Husbands, are not regarded among
the <HI>Pagan-Indians,</HI> because they have betray'd
their weakness in shunning Death; wherefore
they always remain Widows, unless they renounce
their Religion, and turn either <HI>Christians</HI> or <HI>Ma∣hometans.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Parsis</HI> neither burn, neither interr their
dead Bodies;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Parsis.</NOTE> they lay them upon an Iron-Grate,
and thus expose them to the Sun, till their Flesh
being consum'd, the Bones fall through the Grate
into the Hole that is underneath the Grate. These
<HI>Parsis</HI> have no Temples, every Fire-place being
their Altar, where they pay their Devotion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> have several goodly <HI>Mosques</HI>
in <HI>Suratte,</HI> besides which they have many others
in the circumjacent places, which, tho' entitled
with the names of <HI>Mosques,</HI> are no more than so
many Arches with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole in them towards the
side of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and a small Cistern near it, for
the Conveniency of bathing.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="155"/>
The <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples are all without the City;
tho' some of the richer sort, by the powerful In∣tercession
of good Presents, obtain leave to have
private ones in their Houses; It is in these Tem∣ples
they exercise their Devotion, where they a∣dore
and bring their Offerings to their idols,
which sometime, resemble some living Creatures,
but for the most part are very strange and ridi∣culous
Postures, the Offerings serve for the main∣tainance
of the <HI>Bramans.</HI></P>
<P>Without one of the Gates of <HI>Suratte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A large Cistern near <HI>Su∣ratte.</HI></NOTE> there is a
great Tanke or Cistern of sixteen Angles, con∣taining
in compass two thousand Paces; it is
pav'd at the bottom with Freestone, having at e∣very
Angle, a pair of Stairs to go down into it,
except three which are reserv'd for watering-pla∣ces.
This Cistern is during the rainy Season, fill'd
with Water, which being conveyed thither by a
Canal, formerly supply'd the whole City with
Water, till of late years, the Inhabitants are more
commodiously furnished with it from five very
large and fine Wells. In the very center of this
Cistern is a magnificent Structure of Freestone,
whither you must go to in a Boat.</P>
<P>On the same side of the City, where this Ci∣stern
is, but at some miles distance, is the Prin∣cesses
Garden, so call'd, because it belongs to the
Sister of the <HI>Great Mogul;</HI> it has several fine Chap∣pels,
beautified with Walks on both sides.</P>
<P>About a Musket shot from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sacred Tree.</NOTE> is to be seen
that Tree, call'd by the <HI>Pagan Indians, The sacred
Tree,</HI> of such a bigness, that its Branches spread
two hundred and fifty Paces round. The <HI>Bani∣ans</HI>
have a particular Veneration for this Tree,
and adorn it with Banners; under its shadow is a
<HI>Pagan</HI> Temple, resembling a Grotto, dedicated to
a certain Idol, which they call, <HI>The Mother of
Mankind.</HI> At the Gate, there is constantly at∣tending
a <HI>Braman▪</HI> who receives the Offerings,
and marks the Fore-heads of such as come to pay
their Devotion, with a red Stroke.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="156"/>
All round about <HI>Suratte</HI> are many large Wells,
of about 36 Foot Diameter, for the conveniency
of Passengers to squench their Thirst, provided
with very commodious Steps. They draw the
Water out of these Cisterns or Wells in great quan∣tities,
by Oxen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they water their Grounds.</NOTE> who perform this service by the
help of certain Wheels; The Water being after∣wards
by small Channels or Ditches, conveyed all
over the neighbouring Grounds, renders them ve∣ry
fertile, so that they bear Wheat, notwithstand∣ing
the violence of the heat of the Climate; and
it seems not improbable, that the like Invention
might be put in practise in the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI>
with the same advantage.</P>
<P>The delicious Gardens about this City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> near <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ratte.</HI></NOTE> are the
most delightful in the World, affording among
other Fruits of all sorts, great store of Grapes,
nevertheless they don't make any Wine here, be∣cause
both the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> rather ad∣mire
the <HI>Tary,</HI> or Palm-tree Wine, which is al∣together
like the same which is drawn at <HI>Cape-Verd.</HI></P>
<P>All the Ships coming to <HI>Suratte</HI> out of the Ter∣ritories
belonging to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> as all other
<HI>Mahometan</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Vessels enter over the Bar of

the <HI>European</HI> and other <HI>Christian</HI> Vessels come to
an Anchor in the Port of <HI>Sovaly,</HI> at five Leagues

<P>As you go from <HI>Sovaly</HI> by Land to <HI>Suratte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Port of <HI>Sovaly.</HI></NOTE> you
cross a most delicious Champion Country, where

Houses at <HI>Sovaly,</HI> unless a few for the conveniency

of foreign Seamen: Besides which, there are here
three great Factories, to wit: of the <HI>French, En∣glish</HI>

which are distinguished by their Banners of their

<P>THE Empire of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> call'd o∣therwise

and the largest and most populous in all the <HI>Indies;</HI>
it is situate under the 20th degree. The Castle of
<PB N="30" REF="157"/>
<HI>Agra</HI> is but at some distance from the fair River
<HI>Camroin,</HI> betwixt which and the Castle, there are
certain places appointed for the exercising of
Troops, for the Combats of Elephants, and for
such other Sports as the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> does divert
himself with at certain times.</P>
<P>Within the Precinct of this Castle is the <HI>Royal</HI>
Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Castle.</NOTE> which has three distinct Courts, each of
them embellished with fine Portico's and Galleries
richly gilt, where the <HI>Omrats</HI> or Lords, the Offi∣cers
of the Court and of the Guards, have their
Lodgings.</P>
<P>Behind this there are several other most magni∣ficent
Pallaces, which are very pleasantly situated
near the River side. To be short, <HI>Agra</HI> infinite∣ly
exceeds <HI>Suratte,</HI> its Market-places, <HI>Mosques,</HI>
Temples, Tombs, Gardens and <HI>Bagnio</HI>'s, being
much more magnificent in all respects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogul</HI> does not at present keep his

from <HI>Suratte</HI> than <HI>Agra.</HI> He there keeps his
Court, which for its magnificence exceeds all o∣thers
in those Parts; his Palace is half a League in
compass, where is to be seen his Throne, so Fa∣mous
in the <HI>Indian</HI> Histories, being composed of
what is most valuable and precious in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
which ever since the Reign of the <HI>Great Tamerlain,</HI>
has been deputed by his Successors, to the present
<HI>Great Mogul Auren Zebe,</HI> (who deduces his Pedi∣gree
from that Great Warrior) for the beautifying
of this Throne, to render it the most accomplish∣ed
in the World. The <HI>Great Mogul</HI> wears upon
his Arm a Diamond, of an inestimable Value,
being as big as a Pullets Egg.</P>
<P>This Diamond was stoln out of the Diamond-Mines
belonging to the King of <HI>Bisnagar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diamond-Mines.</NOTE> betwixt
<HI>Tonguin</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> where every day are 20000
Men at work. The King reserves all the best Di∣amonds
for his own Uses, which are not to be sold.
The best of those we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> being only
look'd upon as inconsiderable, are sold to the <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="157"/>
Merchants. Such Diamonds as are abroad,
and exceed the common sizes are all stoln, as the
above-mentioned Diamond was, belonging to the
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> which weighs two hundred four∣score
and ten <HI>Mangetins,</HI> each <HI>Mangetin</HI> being five
Grains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogul</HI> sets aside every day two hours
for publick Audiences, and dispensing of Justice
to his Subjects, in the presence of the Great Lords
of his Court, who stand by with their Hands
cross their Stomachs. His standing Forces are al∣ways
three hundred thousand Horses, of which
fifty thousand are his Guards. The rest are divi∣ded
in the several Garrisons, under the Jurisdicti∣on
of their particular Governours, who never
have above ten thousand Men under their Com∣mand,
and are to assemble upon the first Sum∣mons
from the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> at the Rendezvouz,
were he sometimes Musters all his Forces, consist∣ing
of 30000 Horse. Their Infantry is very in∣considerable.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Court (as indeed in all o∣thers
in the <HI>Indies</HI>) nothing is to be done without
Money; The best and most accepable Comple∣ment
you can make to the Courtiers here, is, to
bring your Presents along with you, when you
are admitted into their presence. There is no
Nation but what is welcome to them, provided
they make use of the Gold Key, which in∣deed,
opens a free Passage to all, in most Courts
in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Arms used by the Subjects of the <HI>Great
Mogul,</HI> are; Swords, Ponyards, Bows and Ar∣rows,
Javellins and Pistols. The Infantry is pro∣vided
with Piques and Muskets. They also make
use of Armours and Head-pieces.</P>
<P>Before ever the <HI>Great Moguls</HI> kept their Court
at <HI>Agra</HI> or <HI>Dely,</HI> their Residence were at <HI>Lahor,</HI>
under the 30th degree of North Latitude. Be∣sides

All the way betwixt <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Lahor</HI> (which

is planted with Trees near the Road side, which
appears like one Ally of so many Leagues.</P>
<P>Besides the Provinces of <HI>Gusuratte, Agra, Dely</HI>
and <HI>Lahor,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> has sixteen more under
his Jurisdiction, each of which may pass very well
for a Kingdom. The Province of <HI>Cachenjire</HI> ex∣cels
all the rest for its pleasant Situation, but as to
its Revenues, it is less considerable than any of
the rest: The whole yearly Revenue of the <HI>Great
Mogul,</HI> amounts to three hundred and fifty Mil∣lions

<P>In the Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> there are
Elephants, Rhinoceros's, Camels, Dromedaries,
Bouflers, Horses, Mules; Mutton, Rabbits, Hogs,
Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Panthers, Dogs, Apes;
all sorts of Birds of Prey, Peacocks, Pullets,
Pidgeons, Patridges, Parrots, and all sorts of
wild Fowl. The Grounds are generally fertile;
the Men are very dextrous and ingenious at any
thing they undertake, and the Women very hand∣some
and complaisant. The Cities are for the
most part, very pleasantly situated, their Market
places and Squares very convenient, their Gardens
and Buildings most magnificent; especially their
publick Structures, which are erected either by their
Princes or rich Merchants, who generally are of the
Race of the <HI>Banians.</HI> The whole Country is full

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Musk, and from whence it
comes.</HEAD>
<P>THE Musck which is sold at <HI>Suratte</HI> is brought
thither from <HI>Tonquin</HI> and <HI>Bengalle,</HI> from whence
it is Transported into <HI>Europe;</HI> they put it
up in Leaden Boxes, notwithstanding which it
loses a third part in weight:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King∣dom of <HI>Betton.</HI></NOTE> But its true Origine
is neither in <HI>Tonquin</HI> nor <HI>Bengalle,</HI> but in the King∣dom
of <HI>Betton.</HI> This Kingdom is under the 42th
Degree, about 300 Leagues North from the Mouth
of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> which disembogues into the
Sea of <HI>Bengalle,</HI> being surrounded on all sides with
unaccessible Rocks. The King of this Country,
whom they call <HI>Geudonfrain,</HI> is a Soveraign Prince,
who has no dependency on the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> or any
other King, living always in Tranquility, by rea∣son
of these high Mountains, which serve them as
a Bulwork against any Attempts of the Enemies.
The Inhabitants are all of a white Complexion,
very tall, have large and flat Noses, and for the
rest, are a very simple People. They seldom Tra∣vel
beyond the compass of their own Country, un∣less
it be a few among them who Trade to <HI>China,</HI>
but they never come within the Territories of the
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and they suffer but very few of his
Subjects to Trade among them. It is the general
Opinion, that this Country of <HI>Betton</HI> is the only
in the World which produces the Creature
that furnishes us with that Perfume called Musk.
It is Transported from thence through the King∣dom
of <HI>Bengalle,</HI> into the Country of the <HI>Great
<PB N="34" REF="159"/>
Mogul,</HI> into <HI>Persia,</HI> the <HI>Red Sea, Turkey,</HI> and <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
And on the Eastern-side, into <HI>Tartary, China,</HI>
and <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>The Creature that bears the <HI>Musk</HI> is not unlike
a She-Goat; The Inhabitants catch them a Hunt∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they Catch this Creature.</NOTE>
and shoot them with Arrows. Sometimes
they dig Holes and thus catch them in the Trap.
They have also another way of entangling them
in Nets, and so knock them on the head; For they
fasten very large Nets round the Woods where
they know them to resort in whole Troops; which
done, they make a noise with a certain Instrument,
called by the Inhabitants, <HI>Gomene,</HI> which having
a sound most like our Bells, these Creatures are
thus frightned and catch'd in the Nets.</P>
<P>Both Males and Females have betwixt the Flesh
and Skin, just under the Navel▪ a certain Bag or
Bladder of a Semicirculer Figure, one part being
joined to the Flesh, which being full of an Un∣ctious
Substance, is sometimes bigger and plumper,
sometimes less and flatter; These Substance is these
that we call Musk.</P>
<P>Great care must be taken in gathering this Per∣fume
not to break the Bladder or Vessel that con∣tains
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Musk is gathered▪</NOTE> for fear of loosing part of so precious a
Commodity. To prevent which, they commonly
cut some small part of the Flesh where it adjoins
to it, out with the Bag, which, after it becomes
dry, is easily separated from it, when it appears
like a Ball and one entire Bag, if it be otherwise,
they suppose it to be Adulterated. They have
a way of sewing up the Slit so artificially, that it is
very difficult to be discerned.</P>

<P>First of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-In∣dia</HI> Com∣panies to be join'd.</NOTE> I lay this down as a Fundamental
Rule, That both the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Compa∣nies
are to be join'd into one, that so being but one
and the same▪ both their Stock and Forces may be
united, and consequently be rendred more Power∣ful,
the better to defend themselves against the At∣tempts
of their Ennemies, who being Envious at
their Success, will not in all likelihood meet with
the same Advantage against them when they find
them to act with united Counsels and Purses,
than they might if their Interests are separated.</P>
<P>All of what Degree soever should have free
admittance to this Company: I would have some
of the Prelacy, many of the Nobility and Magi∣stracy,
have considerable Shares in it. For the
rest, They should endeavour to make such as have
<PB N="36" REF="160"/>
had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable Commands both by Sea and Land,
the richest Merchants and Citizens of <HI>Paris, Roan,
Lyons,</HI> and the other chief Cities of the Kingdom,
Members of this Society.</P>
<P>There ought to be distinct Offices settled, one
for the Management of the Political Part, the other
for Traffick; each of them under the Dir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of
a President and Commissioners, who being Men
of Sense, and such as have been in the <HI>Indies</HI> be∣fore,
ought to have their Voices, and take Cogni∣zance
of all Matters relating to their respective
Offices of the Company, who ought to provide
them with a competent yearly Salary. The Lords
of the first, and of the most Illustrious Families of
<HI>France</HI> should be constituted Generalissimo's, one for
the <HI>East,</HI> the other for the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> These ought
to derive their Authority, and full Power to Com∣mand
in Chief from the King, without controul,
in all such Places as are Dependent from the said
Company, and all the Directors, and other Agents,
who are entrusted with the Management of Affairs
in <HI>Persia,</HI> both the <HI>Indies, China,</HI> and <HI>Japan;</HI> and
finally, all such Officers as have any Commissions
on account of the said Company, beyond the Bor∣ders
of <HI>Europe,</HI> ought to receive their Orders from
these Generalissimo's.</P>
<P>The Persons chosen for the discharge of so great
a Trust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Gene∣rals are to be chosen.</NOTE> ought to be such as have signalized them∣selves
by their great Actions, and are Endowed
with Moderation, Justice, Constancy, Valour,
Piety, and such other Qualifications as are requi∣site
for the discharging their Office, in a station of
so much consequence to the whole Nation.</P>
<P>Persons of a Noble Extraction and equally Qua∣lified
with such Endowments, when strengthened
with so great a Character, are most suitable to the
Genius of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, who living under the
Jurisdiction of a great and vertuous Prince at
home, don't without Reluctancy submit to the
Commands of others, who have scarce any title to
their Greatness, than perhaps bare chance, and are
<PB N="37" REF="160"/>
more beholding for it to Fortune than their own
Merits. We ought in this Point to follow the
footsteps of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who have found their
Viceroy's in the <HI>Indies,</HI> (who are always chosen out
of the Noblest Families of <HI>Portugal</HI>) prove very
advantageous to their Affairs.</P>
<P>I would have the Sea-Captains to be chosen for
that Service, of betwixt 35 and 45 years of Age;
If they be much older, their frequent Trials and
Hazards of the Seas, makes them more timerous
than they ought to be; whereas young People are
more daring, and consequently much more proper
to undertake those Hazards which must needs at∣tend
new Discoveries and unknown Countries.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, that there are few places
in those parts, were this Company strengthned and
established under the Protection of <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI>
may not establish themselves, either by the Consent
of the Inhabitants or force of Arms; wherefore I judge
it advisable to establish Colonies on the <HI>African</HI>
Coast, about 600 Leagues distant from one
another at farthest, and among the rest to take
care that one may be settled as near as possibly can
be near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> Some there must
also be established in <HI>America,</HI> but especially on
the Coast of <HI>Brasil.</HI> It would also be very conve∣nient
to make our selves Masters of one of the
Islands under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> near the <HI>African</HI>
Coast; where care must be taken to build a good
Fort for the security and conveniency of such as
from time to time should be sent thither from
<HI>France,</HI> the better to inure them by degrees to the
Sea-Air and the Hot Climate.</P>
<P>All these Places will be of great service at one
time or other to the <HI>French</HI> Ships in their Voyages
to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> it being unquestionable, that
one of the main Inconveniencies in those long
Voyages, proceeds from the want of convenient
Harbouring where to refresh themselves; and to
seek for a place of Retreat among Strangers is ve∣ry
chargeable, and seldom granted but under very
<PB N="38" REF="161"/>
strict Limitations, and consequently ought not to
be relied upon, nor to be made use of but in case
of necessity.</P>
<P>These places will also afford another considerable
advantage, which is, that such Persons that have
lived there for sometime, may be carried with
much better prospect to the <HI>Indies,</HI> than these,
who but lately were brought out of <HI>Europe,</HI> foras∣much
as they being already accustomed to the
heats of the Climate, their constitution must needs
be more agreeable to the Climate of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I would advise to carry to the <HI>Indies</HI> no other but
Secular Priests, the rest being generally Ambitious
and too much addicted to their own Interests, and
always intermeddling with State-Affairs, and
such other Matters as have not the least affinity
with the Character they ought to bear in the
World.</P>
<P>I would have this Company take this for a
Maxim in their Colonies: <HI>One Nation, one Reli∣gion.</HI>
The <HI>Dutch</HI> mixed with the <HI>French,</HI> and the
<HI>Hugonots</HI> with the <HI>Catholicks,</HI> did never live in a
good Union. We are obliged for this to the Pie∣ty
of <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> that in <HI>France</HI> there is now
but one, and that the true antient Religion; nei∣ther
see I the least reason, why the <HI>French</HI> should
have any occasion to make use of strangers in their
Colonies in the <HI>Indies.</HI> I am well assured that the
<HI>French</HI> are alone in a capacity to live under what
Climate soever; They Inhabit a Country surround∣ed
by the <HI>Spaniards, Portugeses, English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who have establshed themselves under the <HI>Torrid-Zone,</HI>
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>To give the <HI>French</HI> their due; there is not a
more Civiliz'd Nation in the World, their Manners
and Conversation being look'd upon as most agree∣able
to Introduce themselves in all places. Besides
which they are very Populous, Brave and Daring,
which makes them have an easie access wherever
they come▪ I appeal to experience, the kind Re∣ception
they met with in the Empire of the <HI>Great
<PB N="39" REF="161"/>
Mogul,</HI> of <HI>Calicut, Siam,</HI> and other places in the
<HI>Indies,</HI> of late years, are so many convincing de∣monstrations,
that these Princes received them in
their Territores with a more than ordinary satis∣faction.</P>
<P>Care ought to be taken that some Persons may
be sent into <HI>Japan,</HI> to undeceive that Prince, con∣cerning
the wrongful opinion the <HI>Japoneses</HI> are
preposess'd with in prejudice of the Catholick Reli∣gion.
And all opportunities ought to be courted to
get footing in this, as well as the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But it ought to be observed, that the persons in∣trusted
with these Negotiations in these two Em∣pires,
as well as in the other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
ought to be men of Experience and Authority:
These, as well as all other publick Affairs of Con∣sequence,
ought not to be left to the management
of Merchants; as it is in <HI>Holland,</HI> where Merchants
have a great share in managing Affairs of state, and
the Courts of Justice, and consequently are better
qualified for such business than those of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Care ought to be taken that from time to time,
Envoy's may be sent to those parts, who may re∣lieve
one another; and that they may be provided
with good Yearly Salleries which must be paid
them exactly, without being pinch'd in their Al∣lowances
by those who have the management of
the Treasury in their hands. For if Persons in such
a Station find themselves neglected, they will be
sure to lose no opportunity to retrieve themselves
at any rate.</P>
<P>It is also absolutely necessary for the Company,
to have a Certain City both in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
which lying, as near as can be, in the Center
of the <HI>French</HI> Colonies, must be the residence of
the Generalissimo's, each in his respective place.
The Cities ought to be of an Advantagious situati∣tion,
both in respect of their Fortifications and the
conveniency of their Harbours.</P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Madegascar</HI> ought to be considered
as the chief place of Retreat for such Ships of the
<PB N="40" REF="162"/>
Company as Sail to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> I am abso∣lutely
of opinion, that the first project made in
<HI>France</HI> concerning that Island, ought not to be laid
aside, but is to be pursued to all its intents and
purposes. For besides that, it is not for the Ho∣nour
of <HI>France</HI> thus to abandon an Enterprise,
which they look'd upon as so advantagious to the
Nation; The situation of this Island, its Products
and Riches▪ are sufficient Invitations for us to e∣stablish
our Colonies among them.</P>
<P>It ought to be taken into Consideration, that
this Island lies betwixt the two <HI>Indies,</HI> there is as
good a Road near <HI>Fort-Dauphine,</HI> and in the Bay of
<HI>Antogil.</HI> Beef there is in such plenty, that we have
taken forty Thousand Oxen at a time, after we
had defeated one of their <HI>Grands.</HI> Wild-Fowl,
Fish, Fruits, Grapes, Honey and Wax it produces
in great abundance, and the very Mountains bring
forth good store of Rice. Their Waters are excel∣lently
good, and the Ground is very Rich and
Fruitful. There is not the least question, but that
if the Grounds were carefully cultivated they
would produce very good Wheat, and the Grapes
might be brought to maturity. But if it were o∣therwise,
Wheat may be easily Transported thither
from <HI>Suratte,</HI> from the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Co∣romandet,</HI>
where it is very Cheap. The defect of
good Wine might be easily supplyed from the <HI>Ca∣nary</HI>
Islands, where it costs not above four Pence a
Pint, and a Pint considering its strength, will
go further than a Quart of <HI>French</HI> Wine; besides
that, this Wine gows better by keeping, it being
much finer after it has lain four years, than it was
at the first. It would also be no difficult matter to
transport thither of our <HI>Grave</HI> Wine, <HI>Persian</HI> and
<HI>Goat</HI> Wines, and as much Brandy as they have oc∣casion.</P>
<P>There is scarce any Commodity which the <HI>Euro∣peans</HI>
are Masters of in <HI>Africa, America▪</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI>
but what you meet with in the Isle of <HI>Madagascar▪</HI>
They have Pepper, a sort of Nutmegs, and Clove-Trees,
<PB N="41" REF="162"/>
all sorts of Gums,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches of <HI>Madag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣car.</HI></NOTE> Spices, Sugar, To∣bacco,
precious Stones, Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>I cannot be persuaded, that what the Natives tell
us is true; to wit, that what Gold they have, was
brought into the Island by some Ships which Casu∣ally
came near that shoar, whereof some perished
thereabouts; there being scarce a Man or Woman
so mean, but what have some Golden Ornaments
about them; not to mention here the Treasures
hoarded up by their <HI>Grands,</HI> which they never
touch but in case of the greatest extremity; and
seems to be a convincing argument, that there are
some Gold Mines in this Island.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de la Case</HI> was not ignorant of this ad∣vantage,
and Monsieur <HI>de la Milleray,</HI> was so well
convinced of the Riches and true Value of the
Products of this Island, that he would never part
with his right, while he lived.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>de Caron</HI> got once into his possessi∣on
a piece of Amber-Greese, weighing Eighteen-Ounces.
There is a Prodigious quantity of Silk
and Cotton in the Island, and yet these are the
chief Commodities, which are brought out of the
Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and of fourteen o∣ther
Kings, his Tributaries, who all must be court∣ed
by great Presents to allow the Exportation of
these Commodities.</P>
<P>As for the Air of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> it is very whole∣some
and pure, witness those of its Inhabitants
who arrive to a great age, it being common a∣mong
them to see some of a Hundred and Twenty
years of Age. It cannot be deny'd, but that it has
not proved so agreeable to the <HI>Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> constituti∣on,
but if the matter be duly weighed, it will ap∣pear,
that this proceeded more from the change of
Diet, and from their carlesness in not keeping
their Stomachs warm, than from any other cause;
For I have made this observation, that those born
under a cold Climate, if transported into those
parts, ought not to neglect that point, as they ten∣der
their health and lives.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="163"/>
There is one objection to be made, to wit:
That several other Nations, who have taken a▪
view of the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> never shew'd any
Inclination to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant their Colonies here; But this
I think derogates nothing from the true value
which ought to be put upon this Island. For it is
possible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why other Nations never set∣led in this Island.</NOTE> that these Nations who are less powerful
than the <HI>French,</HI> being before settled in many o∣ther
places, found themselves not in a capacity to
Conquer an Island, which is the biggest in the whole
World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueses</HI> have their Settlements in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
and the Ports of <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Isle
of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and the <HI>Molucees,</HI> and in short in all o∣ther
places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where the <HI>Portugueses</HI>
had established themselves before. The <HI>English</HI>
have their Forts on the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast, at <HI>Coroman∣del,</HI>
and several other places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
they Traffick with less charge and inconveniency,
than in a place which they were first to be possess'd
or by force of Arms.</P>
<P>The re-estab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishment of the <HI>French</HI> in the Isle of
<HI>Madagascar,</HI> ought to be committed to the ma∣nagement
of a Person, who by his Merits and long
Experience has acquired a great Reputation abroad;
This being a point of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icety, and such a na∣ture,
where one man by his Conduct may be able
to do more than a thousand others who act with∣out
prudence.</P>
<P>The first thing the <HI>French</HI> have to do after their
Landing, is to re-fortifie the Fort <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which
they ought to look upon as the Capital of their
Colonies here, and must be the residence of the
Governour, by reason of the temperature of the air,
and its convenient situation, which is on the Point
of <HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>The Conquest of this Island is not so difficult as
some have Imagined, the <HI>Grands,</HI> (or Lords) of
the Country, being divided among themselves by
so many different Interests, that the most Power∣ful
<PB N="43" REF="163"/>
among them is not in a capacity to bring one
hundred part of the Inhabitants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arms. Their
Arms having no comparison to ours, they are so
frightened at our Fire-locks, that we have seen
160 <HI>Frenchmen</HI> Force one third part of the Isle to
do homage to them. <HI>Dian Manangve,</HI> who be∣ing
one of their Principal Lords, and the only per∣son
that had got an insight into the <HI>French</HI> Affairs,
is now dead; and their Reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llion chiefly carried on
by his advice against the <HI>French,</HI> ought to serve
them as a precaution for the future, not to admit
any of their <HI>Grands</HI> into their Councils, and to let
them have any knowledge in the Military Art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Madagascarians</HI> are naturally jealous of
their Liberty, Rebel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous, Mistrustful, and Re∣vengeful,
seldom forgetting an injury. It will
be therefore the Duty of a Governour to take such
measures as may be most effectual to curb their In∣solency,
and especially so to clip their wings for
time to come, as to put them beyond all probabi∣lity,
to execute their vengeance and cruelties upon
their Conquerers.</P>
