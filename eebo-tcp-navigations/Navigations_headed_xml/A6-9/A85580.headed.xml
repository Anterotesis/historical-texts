<HEAD>A great and wonderful Victory obtain∣ed by the English horse and foot, un∣der the command of Gen. Venables, in the West Indies: With the manner how they landed in the French Con∣tinents, the opposition made by the Natives, and others, with their Ar∣rows, and the taking of most of their Gold and Silver Mines.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y an Express brought from the Barba∣does to VVhite-Hall, by a Merchant∣man, we understand, That Gen. Pen and Gen Venables, having been there with the Fleet, consisting of 35 gallant ships, after few dayes, being supplyed with 2000 foot, and 700 horse, with all other Necessaries and Furniture of
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>war, a general Councel were called aboard the George, where the Officers unanimously resolv∣ed to weigh Anchor, and by the Assistance of the Almighty, to prosecute the design in hand, ac∣cording to the Commission and Instructions of his Highness the Lord Protector. In pursuance whereof, Major Gen. Haines with his Squadron, was the first that hoysted sayl, and lanched forth amongst the cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Waves; and then immediat∣ly Valiant Pen, with Gen. Venables, and the rest of the Fleet bare up after them; bending their course towards the Cariby I slands; where, at the coming up of the Flag-ships, the whole Navy had a Rendevouz: And from thence (if Report sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aks truth) to another part of the Western In∣dies, where the French were as rich as potent, and by their extream predominancy, lamentably over awed the English; keeping them onely as meer vassals and slaves, to serve their insatiable wils: but upon the neer approach of Englands stately Ar∣mado, great was the Allarm throughout those I∣sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds, and many were struck with such a pannick fear, especially the Natives, that they lest many rich Commodities and goods behind them, en∣deavouring to fly further up into the Countries;
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>but the Monsieurs remanded them back again by so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, causing them to imbody with sundry darts, and saying, they would make them da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken the Sky with Arrows: And so drawing them up in a warlike posture, planted them and the English, (under Command of their own Officers) at the most eminent and dangerous Passes. This being done, the French Governour brought up his Re∣serves, and resolved to make opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sition, but the two Generals discharging some great Guns, and afterwards manning out their men so sast in long boats, that they soon forced their passage upon Land, in which heroick A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chievment, the Volun∣teers (formerly Commanders and Gentlemen of Fortune in the late K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs Army) performed sin∣gular service, shewing abundance of gallantry, and magnanimity of spirit in the very thickest of acti∣on. And, indeed, though they are said to be but four hundred, yet thus much (to the honour of English-men) may be said, that their Gallantry (in some respect) extended as farre, as the Noble Acts of Chivalry of those four thousand souldi∣ers at Numantia in Spain, who withstood forty thousand Romanes for fourteen years together, in which time having often valiantly repulsed them,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>and forced them unto two dishonorable composi∣tions; at last when they could well hold out no longer, they gathered all their Armour, Money, and Goods together, and laid them on a heap; which being fired, they voluntarily buried them∣selves in the flames thereof, leaving unto Scipio nothing but the bare name of Numantia to adorn his tryumph with. In like manner, the fame of this story (by way of circumstance) saith, That some of the Monsieus, having exceedingly in∣riched themselves chose rather to fire their Posses∣sions, and sacrifice their lives in the flames thereof, then yield and submit to a stranger; but the ma∣jor part conceiving it no way possible to with∣stand so resolved an enemy, cast down their arms and cryed for mercy. During which dispute, ma∣ny were killed and wounded (by estimation 300, but the number not certainly known) and two or three thousand taken prisoners; (of all sorts and sexes) besides, it is said, that the English are be∣come Masters of no less then three and thirty gold and silver Mines; which, if true, will doubtlesse make our English Continent the most flourish∣ing Common-wealth under the Sun, and eternize their never-dying-same throughout all Ages.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<P>And further it is said, that they have made so great an inroad into the Countrey, for the space of twenty or thirty miles, that not an enemy dare not so much as peep or shew his head in any ho∣stile manner. And by the tender respect, affability and clemency of the English towards the poor Natives, so great Effects have taken influence thereupon, that they are even sensible of their pre∣sent condition of Freedom, and so tractable, that upon the least motion or sign, they become ser∣viceable in any thing. But of this, and other par∣ticulars, a Confirmation is suddenly expected, in case any thing hath occur'd of Action, which no way yet seems unprobable, though in this jun∣cture of time presented somewhat dubious; by reason I had rather pre-suppose the event of mo∣tionary action, then incur the displeasure of any by way of detestation.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P>His Highness the Lord Protector, with the ad∣vice of the Council, having taken into their gra∣cious and serious consideration, the present estate and condition of the Sea and Land-forces, under toe command of Gen. Pen, and Gen. Venables, have Ordered and Appointed, that a considerable num∣ber of ships be forthwith expedited for the said ser∣vice, with such provisions and Necessaries as shall be conceived requisite: And accordingly Nine ships are now ready to be set forth, viz. The Hen∣ry, the Maiden-head, and seven others, with Bis∣kets, Cheese, Butter, Beer, Beef, Pork, Pease, and di∣vers other Necessaries: A prosperous Gale at∣tend them.</P>
