<HEAD>Of the Circles of the Map and their uses.</HEAD>
<P>THe Earth and Sea, composed themselves in a Sphericall figure, and is caused by the proper inclination of each part, which being heavy falls from every point of the circum∣ference, and claps about the center, there settlers as neer as it may towards his place of rest: we may ilustrate both the fi∣gure and scituation by a familiar similitude to an ingenious apprehension; Suppose we a knot to be knit in the midst of a Cord that hath many ends, and those to be delivered to sun∣dry men of equall strength to be drawne severall ways round from every part above, and below, and on each side.</P>
<P>Questionlesse while every man draws in the boes of the knots, it must needs become round, and whilst they continue to pluck with equall strength it must rest immoveable in the middle betwixt them, since every strength that would destroy, hath a strength equall to resist it; so it is in the bosome of the earth, where every part wheels upon equall priviledge of na∣ture, nor can any presse farther then the center to destroy this compacted figure, for it must meet there with a body that will oppose it, or if not, yet could it not passe, since every motion from the middle were to ascend, which nature will not per∣mit in a body of weight as the whole earth is.</P>
<P>The compasse of the whole is cast by our latest and most learned, to be 21600 English miles, which though none ever yet so pared as to measure them by the foot, yet let not the ig∣norant reject this accompt, since the rule by which they are led cannot faile: for we see by continuall experience, that the Sun for every degree in the heavens, gains sixty miles upon the earth, towards his Circuit round, and after three hundred sixty degrees, returneth to the same point in respect of us as before it was: repeat the number of 60 so oft and you will finde the accompt just, and so by proportion of the circum∣ference to the diamiter, which is <HI>tripla sesqui-septima,</HI> the same which 22 hath hath to 7. We may judge likewise of the earths thicknesse to the center. The whole diamiter must by rule be somewhat lesser then a third part of the circuit, that in pro∣portion to 21600 will be 6872. halfe the number will reach
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>the middle of the world, and that is 3436 in this report both of the quantity and forme of the earth; we must not require such exactnesse as cannot vary a hairs breadth, for we see the mountains of the earth, &amp; oftentimes the waves of the sea make the superficies unequal, it will be sufficient if there be no diffe∣rence, sensible to be reckoned in so great a <HI>bulk;</HI> for let us rude∣ly hew a ball out of rough stone, still it is a ball, though not so smooth as one of Christal, or suffer a mote to fall upon a sphear of glass, it changeth not its figure, far lesse are the moun∣tains which we see in respect of the whole lumpe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>What a Globe is.</HEAD>
<P>A Globe we define to be an Analogicall representation ei∣ther of the heavens or of the earth, and we call it Anago∣licall, not onely in regard of its forme, expressing the figure of the heavens, as also of the terrestriall Globe, consisting of the earth it selfe, together with the interflowing seas, but ra∣ther, because that it representeth unto us in a just proportion and distance each particular constellation in the Heavens, and every severall region and tract of ground in the earth, together with certain circles, both greater and lesser, invented by artificers for the more ready computation of the same.</P>
<P>The greater circles we call those which divide the whole superficies of the Globe into equall parts or halfs and those the lesser which divide the same into two unequall parts.</P>
<P>Besides the body of the Globe it selfe, there is also an∣nexed a certaine frame, with necessary instruments thereto belonging.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of the frame is thus; first of all there is a base or foot to rest upon, on which, there are raised perpendicular∣ly six pillars or columnes of equall length and distance, upon the top of which there is fastned to a levell a round plate orcircle of wood, which they call the Horizon, because that the uppermost superficies thereof performs the office of the true Horizon, for it divideth the whole Globe into 2 equal parts whereof that which was uppermost, representeth unto us the visible Hemisphere, and the other, that which is hid from us. So likewise the circle which divideth that part of the world
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>which we see from the other, which we see not is called the Horizon, and that point which is directly over our heads in our Hemisphere, and is on every side equadistant from the Horizon, is commonly called Zenith, and that point which is opposite to it in the lower Hemisphere, is commonly written Nadir these two points are called also the Poles of the Hori∣zon.</P>
<P>Furthermore, upon the superficies of the Horizon in a mate∣riall Globe, there are described first, the twelve signes of the Zodiack, and each of these is divided againe into thirty lesser portions, so that the whole horizon is divided into 360 parts, which they also call degrees, and every degree is divided into sixty parts, also each of them is called a scruple or minute, and so by the like subdivision of minutes into sixty parts will a∣rise seconds, and of these thirds, and likewise fourths, and fifths, &amp;c. but the like partition still of each into sixty parts.</P>
<P>There is also described upon the Horizon, the Roman Ca∣lender, and that three severall ways, to wit, the ancient way, which is still in use with us here in England, and the new way appointed by Pope Gregory 23, wherein the Aequinoxes and Solstice were restored to the same places they were in at the time of the Celebration of the counsell of <HI>Nice,</HI> and in the third, the said Aequinoctiall and Solsticall points are restored to the places they were in, at the time of our Saviour Christs nativity.</P>
<P>The months in the Calender, are divided into dayes and weeks, to which are annexed as their peculiar characters the 7 first letters of the Alphabet</P>
<P>The innermost border of the Horizon, is divided into thirty two parts, according to the number of the winds, which are observed by our moderne Sea-faring-men in their Navigati∣ons, by which also they are wont to designe forth the quarters of the Heavens, and the Coasts of Countries, the names of the windes are set downe both in English and Latine, in the Horizon of the materiall Globes.</P>
<P>The use of the Horizon is manifold, First it divides the heavens into 2 Hemisphears; Secondly it shews what stars ne∣ver set, and what never rise from under the earth, and so like∣wise what stars doe both rise and set; Thirdly, it sheweth the
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>cause of the equality and inequality of the artisiciall days and nights; Fourthly, it conduceth to the finding out of the la∣titude of any place; Fifthly, it is the cause of the rectitude and obliquity of the Sphear, whereof we have occasion to speake more largely hereafter.</P>
<P>There is also let into this Horizon two notches, opposite one to the other, a circle of brasse, making right angles with the said Horizon, and placed so that it may be removed at pleasure up and down by those notches, as need shall require; This Circle is called the Meridian because that one side of it which is in like manner divided into 360 degrees, supplyeth the office of the true Meridian. Now the Meridian is one of greater circles, passing through the Poles of the world, and al∣so of the Horizon, to which when the Sun in his daily revolu∣tion is arrived in the upper Hemisphere it is mid-day, and when it toucheth the same in the lower Hemisphear it is mid∣night at the place whose Meridian it is.</P>
<P>The Meridian (which comes first to be considered) is a great Circle compassing round the Earth from Pole to Pole; and is that which you see in the circumference of both Planisphears of the Map, and wherein are written the names of the Zones and Climates, This chief, first, fixed Meridian passeth through the Islands called Azores, according to the ancient Cosmo∣graphers; and there are two reasons why they did there be∣gin to reckon the longitude of the Earth.</P>
<P>First, for that at that time there was no land known further to the Westerne then that place.</P>
<P>Secondly, Under that Meridian the Needle in the Marri∣ners compasse had no variation, but did point directly North and South.</P>
<P>There be also many Meridians according to the divers places in which a man lives, the number of them equall to so many points as may be imagined in the Globe; but the usuall set∣ting them known to view, is by ten degrees asunder; and are those black lines which you see in both Planisphears, running downe along from the North to the South Pole.</P>
<P>The use of the Meridian, is to shew the longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City or Cape, is the distance of it East from the first great Meridian; and this lon∣gitude
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>is measured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian into the East, and containeth the whole compasse of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> 360. degrees.</P>
<P>To prove this by example, cast your eye on <HI>London,</HI> and you shall see it something to the East of the second black Meridi∣an; passe downe with that black line to the Aequinoctiall, and look as much East there, as <HI>London</HI> is from that Meridian above, then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall, from the first great Meridian to that place, and that distance is the lon∣gitude of <HI>London,</HI> which you may perceive to be 20 degrees and better: And the like manner of working is to be made for all other places.</P>
<P>That line full of degrees crossing both Planisphears straight along in the middle, and dividing the world into two halfs <HI>(viz.)</HI> North and South halfs; is called the <HI>Aequinoctiall line,</HI> or the Aequator; either because it is of equall distance from both Poles of the world, or else because the Sunne comming in this Circle makes the dayes and nights throughout the world of a length; which happens upon the 10. or 11. of March, and the 13, or 14. of September. It passes through <HI>Abassia</HI> or <HI>Prester Johns</HI> Kingdome, and Manicongo in Africa, through the great Island Sumatra, and the Maldive Isles of A∣sia; and in America, through Guiana.</P>
<P>The use of it is to shew the latitude of any Countrey, Ci∣ty, Promontory, or the like: Now the satitude is the distance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinocti∣all line or middle of the world; and is reckoned and mea∣sured upon the Meridian toward either Pole. Those there∣fore have Northerne latitude that inhabit between the Equi∣noctiall and the North Pole, as they have Southerne latitude that are between the same Equator and the South Pole.</P>
<P>Those black lines thwarting the black Meridians from East to West, are parallels, and are also called Aequidistants, being distant one from another 10 degrees toward both Poles; and are here set downe for the easie counting the latitude of any place from the Aequinoctiall: as for the latitude of <HI>London;</HI> count so many decimall Parallels, till you come to the Pa∣rellel which is nearest <HI>London,</HI> (you shall finde them to be five) then follow that line to the Meridian, and see the figures set
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>thereat; they are 50.) moreover, adde to that number of 50. so much as London is situate above that paralel, the space is one degree and a halfe; thus you shall finde the latitude of <HI>London</HI> (that is, the distance thereof from the Aequator to∣ward the North Pole) to be 51 degrees and a halfe: and in like manner must the latitude of all other places be sought. Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two, the whole Earth is reckoned.</P>
<P>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as also the Zodiack, are filled throughout with degrees, the number 360 and every degree consists of 60 minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20. leagues, or 60 miles.</P>
<P>The great circle that is drawn bending bias in one planis∣phear up to the Tropick of Cancer, in the other down to the Tropick of Capricorne, is the the Zodiack; it is replenished with degrees, and beares on it the Characters of the twelve signes.</P>
<P>The uses of it are to shew over what Countreys and people the body and beams of the Sun come perpendicular at some times or other in the year, and it shews to all (where the days increase and decrease) the longest and shortest days of the year, for the Sun (which causeth the same) being alwayes in this circle, and therein moving about one degree a day, all the while he is coming up from the Tropick of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increase in the Northerne Climates; but contrariwise in his course back from Cancer to Capri∣corne they shorten to us, and lengthen to those in the South∣erne Climates; and this Circles shews the four quarter of the yeare; Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</P>
<P>The Tropick of Cancer, (so called, or the Caelestiall signe Cancer) is a circle, whose distance from the Equinoctiall to∣ward the North, is 23 degrees and a half. When the Sun is come so far Northward as to touch this Circle, then is our longest day in the year.</P>
<P>It passes through the Southermost parts of Barbary and Aegypt, Arabia, India, China, <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> and the Island Cuba.</P>
<P>The Tropick of Capricorne, (likewise so named of the sign Capricorne in the starry heaven) is a circle of like distance at
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>the other Tropick from the Aequinoctial Southward, that is 23 degrees and a halfe. When the Sun is gone downe to the Circle Southward, it is our shortest day in the whole year.</P>
<P>This Tropick passes throngh Monomopata, Saint Laurence Island, Peru, and South coasts of Brasile.</P>
<P>The Artick, or North polar Circle, is distant from the North Pole, 23 degrees and a halfe; so much as the Tropick of Cancer from the Aequinoctiall; but the distance between that Tropick and it, is 43 degrees.</P>
<P>You may see it passe through Island, Norway, Boddia, Moscovy, Tartary, crosse <HI>Davis</HI> Straits, and Greenland.</P>
<P>The Antartike or South polar Circle, is distant from the South Pole, 23. degrees and a halfe; so far as the Tropick of Capricorne is from the Equinoctiall.</P>
<P>The Circle passes through Magellanica, or <HI>Terra Australis Incognita</HI> onely.</P>
<P>Now these four lesser circles, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the two Tropicks, and Polar Circles, doe fitly part the Earth into five Zones.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Zones.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a space of Earth, contained between two of the smaller circles, or within the compasse of either Polar Circle: the name signifies as much as a girdle, by reason that each Zone compasseth about the Earth in manner of a gir∣dle. Of these there be two kinds, one temperate, the other untemperate.</P>
<P>There be two temperate Zones; the one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The North temperate Zone is that space of earth contai∣ned between the Tropick of Cancer, and the North Polar Circle.</P>
<P>The South temperate Zone is that space of earth stretched along between the Tropick of Capricorne, and the South Polar Circle.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P>They are called temperate Zones, for that the aire thereof hath a farre better and more moderate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, then the untemperate Zones. The breadth of them is forty three degrees a piece, which de∣grees make either temperate Zone to be 2580 English miles broad a piece.</P>
<P>The untemperate Zones are twofold; one exceeding in the extremity of heat, the other as much in cold; they have been thought in former times altogether unhabitable, but latter experience hath found them more fit for habitation.</P>
<P>The Torrid or burnt Zone (which is the hot untempe∣rate Zone) is that space of heaven which you see contained between the Tropick of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of Torrid, because the Sun continually passes thereover, and casting downe direct rayes, affects it with a marvellous heat; thereby making it not so inconvenient for the Inhabitants, as the temperate Zones are. The breadth of this Zone is comprehended between the two Topicks, and containes 47 degrees, that is of English miles 2820.</P>
<P>The frozen Zones are spaces of Earth inclosed within either of the Polar Circles: of these there are two, one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The North frozen Zone, is that space of Earth contained within the compasse of the North Polar Circle. The breadth thereof reckoned twenty three degrees and a halfe, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Pole it selfe to the Polar Circle, which of English miles is 1410.</P>
<P>The South frozen Zone, is that space of Earth compassed all about with the South Polar Circle: It hath the like breadth from the South Pole, as the other frozen Zone hath from the North Pole: and likewise the number of miles is the same.</P>
<P>They are called frozen Zones, because they (for the most part) exceed in cold; and that is caused in regard that the Sunne, for a good part of the year, is under the Horizon, and sees them not; and when he is come up into their sight, his appearance (which for a pretty long season together) ra∣ther comforts them, then any vertuall heat proceeding from him; for there the aire is stuft with thick foggy vapours, and
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>his beames at highest fall but very oblilely on them; so that what through his want and unability to dispel the cold and the colds force to resist, and bear back the Suns heat; these Zones remaine almost unhabitable, and even (as the word is) frozen.</P>
<P>The names of all these, set in the right place of each Zone you shall see in that Meridian going about America and Magellanica.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Climates.</HEAD>
<P>IN that great meridian going about Europe, Asia, and Afri∣ca, are described the Climates; Now a Climate is a space of the Earth included within the space of two Parellels. The use of them is to shew the difference of length and shortnesse of dayes over all the world, as you may see in the midst of e∣very climate, set the number of the houres of the longest day in the year, under that Climate: the longest day in one Cli∣mate, differing halfe an hour from the longest in another. so that there are four and twenty Climates, consisting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be twenty foure hours in length, which is twelve houres longer then the or∣dinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be understood; Under the Aequinoctiall line, and thirteen degrees, that is, three Parallels, on either side thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of twelve hours, but after in every Clime increase the length of halfe an houre, so that there are numbred (as is said before) 48 Parallels, which make twenty four Climates, before the dayes become twenty foure houres long; the which length they being grown to, their increase is then by whole weeks and months, till in the four &amp; twentieth Clime: about the Pole, the day is full halfe a year long. And it is thus between the equator and the North Pole, so it is between the said Aequator and South Pole: wherfore there are 2 sorts of Climes, that is 24 Northerne, and as many Southerne. The Climates Northward are thus named; the first is <HI>Dia Me∣roes,</HI> because the middle Parallel thereof passes through the middest of the Inland Island <HI>Meroe,</HI> in the Continent of <HI>Afri∣ca;</HI> the second is <HI>Dia Sienes;</HI> the third <HI>Dia Alexandrias;</HI> the fourth <HI>Dia Rhodos;</HI> the fifth <HI>Dia Romes;</HI> the sixth <HI>Dia Ponton;</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>the seventh <HI>Dia Boristhenes;</HI> the eighth <HI>Dia Ripheos;</HI> the ninth <HI>Per Dianam.</HI> The South Climes hath the same names, save only that the word <HI>Anti</HI> is thereunto added; as <HI>Anti Dia Meroes;</HI> the next <HI>Anti Dia Sienes,</HI> and so along to the ninth South∣ward: further then the ninth Clime on either side the Ae∣quinoctiall they are not named, but yet the Climes run on both wayes to the number of twenty four as is seen in the Meridian. That there be but nine named; the reason is, be∣cause when these names were given, no more then nine Cli∣mats were knowne to those of ancient times; but since, though the number of them be increased to twenty four, the rest are not knowne by proper names, but remaine inno∣minate.</P>
<P>In the two opposite poynts of this Meridian are fastned the two ends of an iron pin, passing through the body of the Globe and its centre, one of which ends is called the Artick, or North pole of the world; and the other the Antartick or South Pole; and the pin it selfe is called the Axis; for the Axis of the world is the Diamiter about which it is turned, and the extreame ends of the Axis are called the Poles.</P>
<P>To either of these Poles when need shall require there is a certaine brasse Circle or ring to be fastned; which Circle is di∣vided into twenty four equall parts, according to the num∣ber of the hours day and night, and it is therefore called the houre Circle, and this Circle is to be applyed to either of the Poles in such sort as that the section where twelve is descri∣bed may precisely agree with the points of midday and mid∣night in the superficies of the true Meridian.</P>
<P>There is also another little pinne to be fastned to the end of the Axis, in the very Center of the howre Circle; this pin is so made as it turns about and poynteth to every of the twen∣ty four sections in the hour Circle, according as the Globe it selfe is moved about, so that you may place the point of it to what houre you please.</P>
<P>The use of this hour-circle and Index, is to denote the houres of the rising and setting of the Sun, and other stars, which must be pactised after this manner; First you mnst set the Globe to your elevation or pole, and then apply the de∣gree of the signe in which the Sun at that time is, to the Me∣ridian
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>and the Index to that 12 houres which is uppermost, and so having thus done you must turne the Globe about till the degree wherein the Sun is come to the Easterne side of the Horizon, which done the Index will point out the houre of his rising, and if you turne it about to the West side, you shall in like manner have the howre of his setting.</P>
<P>There is also belonging to the Meridian, a quadrant of Altitude, being made of a long thin plate, of steel or brasse and fashioned crooked, so that it may be applyed to the con∣vexe superficies of the Globe.</P>
<P>And having the fourth part of the Circle in length and this Quadrant is made in such sort as that it may be fastned on the Meridian, and so be applyed to the Zenith of any place whatsoever, being divided from one end to the other into 90 equall parts or degrees.</P>
<P>There is besides at the foot of the Globe, a Marriners Com∣passe placed, which serves to shew how to place the Globe rightly, according to the four winds or quarters of the world.</P>
<P>Besides these circles expressed in the Globe, there are also some certaine other circles in familiar use with the Practi∣call Astronomers, which they call verticall Circles; these are greater Circles drawn from the verticall point through the Horizon, in what number you please; the office of these Circles is supplyed by the helpe of a Quadrant of altitude which is a thin plate of brasse divided into 90 degrees; this Quadrant must be applyed to the vertex of any place, when you desire to use it, so that the lowest end of it noted with the number of 90, may just touch the Horizon in every place, this Quadrant is made moveable, that so it may be fast∣ned to the verticall point of any place.</P>

<P>THe whole world is divided into two parts, <HI>viz. Elemen∣tall,</HI> and <HI>Etheriall</HI> or <HI>Coelestiall</HI> parts.</P>
<P>The Elementall part is four-fold; <HI>viz. Earth, water, Aire, Fire,</HI> as may be seen in that round figure of the frame of the Heavens and Elements one within another; the inmost and
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>middlemost Circle containing Earth and water intermixed together; the next, the three Regions of the Aire, and imme∣diately above that Orbe, is the Element of Fire; all which you may easily discerne by their severall names in their proper places.</P>
<P>The Etheriall or Celestiall parts do compasse the Elemen∣tall part, and contain the ten upper Spheares, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 <HI>The Moon,</HI> 2 <HI>Mercury,</HI> 3 <HI>Venus,</HI> 4 <HI>Sol,</HI> 5 <HI>Mars,</HI> 6 <HI>Jupiter,</HI> 7 <HI>Saturne,</HI> 8 <HI>the starry Firmament,</HI> 9 <HI>the Christaline Heaven,</HI> having no stars at all; the 10. is the <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> or first mover, containing all the rest within it; and moving from the East to the West carrieth about with it in violence all the other Spheares.</P>
<P>The rest of the Sphears have contrary motions, every one in his kind, though far slower then the other: and their mo∣tions are contrary, from the West to the East, and so are car∣ried about oftentimes by the first mover, before they make one perfect revolution in themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Christaline</HI> or ninth Sphear his motion is almost im∣mensible, and is called the Trembling Motion, and is perfor∣med, according to the opinion of later Astronomers, in 49000 years.</P>
<P>The eight Sphear being the Starry Firmament performeth his motion in 7000 years.</P>
<P>The rest of the Sphears are the seven Planets, each Sphear containeth in it but one Star; whereof the uppermost and slowest is <HI>Saturne,</HI> which perfecteth his course in thirty years. <HI>Jupiter</HI> being next under that, makes his revolution in twelve years. <HI>Mars</HI> beneath him finisheth his course in two years. <HI>Sol</HI> passeth through the Zodiack in 365 days and 6 houres, which is one whole year. <HI>Venus</HI> ends her course in somewhat more then a year. <HI>Mercury</HI> holds equall pace with the Sun. <HI>Luna</HI> courseth about the Heaven once every eight and twenty dayes.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Ʋse of the Globes.</HEAD>
<P>THe first whereof is concerning the position of the Globe, and the other Climates. Now touching the position of the Globe, you are first of all to take care that it be placed per∣pendicularly to the true horizon; Secondly, That the distin∣ction of the winds answer directly to the windes of the reall Horizon, that so the East on your materiall Globe may look directly towards the true East of the world; for which pur∣pose especially there is usually placed a Nauticall compasse in the bottom of the frame. When you have thus placed your Globe so that it may be turned any way at pleasure, yet so that the base or foot be not moved out of its place. The next thing that is to be inquired after, is the latitude of the place wherein you live, which according as it is greater or lesse, you must elevate the Pole of your Globe above the horizon pro∣portionably. As for example, if the latitude be 50, 51, or 52. grad. or more or lesse Northward, then must you elevate the Artick pole, just so many degrees above the Horizon, and so likewise if the latitude be Southerne, you must doe the like by the Antartick or South Pole, But under the Aequator where there is no latitude at all both the Poles must be placed in the very Horizon at opposite points.</P>
<P>Now if you desire to know the longitude of any place ex∣pressed in the Globe, you must apply the same place to the Meridian, and observing at what place the Meridian cutteth the Aequator, reckon the degree of the Aequator from the Me∣ridian of St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Island to that place; for so many are the degrees of longitude of the place you look for.</P>
<P>In the same manner you may measure the difference of lon∣gitude betwixt any other two places that are described in the Globes.</P>
<P>Now if you desire to finde the latitude of any place expres∣sed in the Globe, you must apply the same to the Meridian, and reckon the number of the degrees that it is distant from the Aequator, for so much is the latitude of that place.</P>
<P>To finde the distance of two places, set your Globe in such sort, as that the Zenith of one of the plates be 90 degrees di∣stant
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>every way from the Horizon, and then fasten the Qua∣drant of altitude to the verticall point and so move it up and downe untill it passe through the vertix of the other place, the number of the degrees intercepted in the Quadrant be∣twixt the two places, being resolved into furlongs, miles or leagues, as you please will shew you the true distance of the places assigned, and the other end of the Quadrant that touch∣eth upon the Horizon will show on what winde or quarter of the world the one place is in respect of the other, or what an∣gle or position it hath for the angle or position is that which is comprehended betwixt the Meridian of any place, and a great Circle passing through the Zeniths of any two places assigned, and the quantity of it is to be numbred in the Ho∣rizon.</P>
<P>As for example, The longitude of London is 26 degrees and it hath in Northerne latitude 51 degrees and a halfe. Now it is demanded, what distance and angle of position it beareth to Saint <HI>Michaels</HI> Island, which is one of the Azore we must proceed thus to finde it; first, let the North Pole be Elevated 51½ degrees which is the latitude of London, then fastning the quadrant of altitude to the Zenith of it, that is to say 51 degrees and an halfe Northward from the Aequtor; we must turne it about till it passe through Saint Michaels Island, and wee shall finde the distance intercepted betwixt these 2 places to be 11 degree, 40. m. or thereabouts, which is 280. of our leagues, and if we observe in what part of the horizon the end of the quadrant resteth we shall finde the angle of position to fall neer upon 50 gr. betwixt South-west &amp; by west, and this is the Scituation of this Island in respect of London. The distance of place differing onely in latitude may be found out after this manner; First, you must substract the lesser latitude from the greater, resolving a degree into minutes, if the substracti∣on cannot be done otherwise conveniently, then multiply the degrees by 15, and divide the minutes by 4. and the sum produce will be the distance of those two places in common Germaine miles, one whereof containeth four of our En∣glish miles.</P>

<HEAD>To finde delineation of the Sun for any day given.</HEAD>
<P>HAving first learned the day of the Month, you must look for the same in the Callender described on the Horizon of your Globe, over against which in the same Horizon you shall finde the signe of the Zodiack, and the degree of the same that the Sun is in at that time, but if it be leap year, then for the next day after the <HI>28th.</HI> of <HI>February</HI> you must take that degree of the signe which is ascribed to the day following; As for example, if you desire to know what degree of the Zodiack the Sun is in the <HI>29th</HI> of Febru. you must take that degree which is assigned for the first of March, and for the first of March take the degree of the second, and so forward.</P>
<P>Now when you have found the place of the Sun, apply the same to the Meridian, and reckon thereon how many de∣grees the Sun is distant from the Aequator, for so many will the degrees be of the Suns declination for the day assigned; for the declination of the Sun, or of any other Star, is nothing else but the distance of the same from the Aequator reckoned one the Meridian.</P>
<P>You also finde out the Suns greatest declination by his greatest and least altitude, both in Summer and Winter, by substracting the least out of the greatest, for then halfe that which remaineth will the declination on you seek for.</P>
<P>Now to know the longitude of the Sun for any time, that is to say in what degree of the Zodiack he is, you must doe thus, seek in the limbe of the Horizon for the day of the month for which you would know the longtiude of the Sun, which found, you shall see over against it, among the signes of the Zodiack discribed also upon the Horizon the degree of the signe that exactly answereth to it, and which is the place of the Sun for that day and month, but if it be leap year you must remember after the <HI>28th</HI> of February to adde one day more still as you goe, as if you would look for the place of the Sun on the <HI>13th</HI> of March, you must take that degree which is set for the 14 of March which is the 3 gr. of Libra.</P>

<P>The like effect may be wrought by observeing the Meridi∣an altitude of any other star expressed in the Globe, for if you set your Globe so as that the star you mean, to observe be so much elevated above the Horizon, as the Meridian altitude of it is observed to be the elevation of the Pole above the Ho∣rizon will shew the latitude of the place.</P>

<P>FIrst having taken with your compasses the complement of the altitude of your first observation, now the complement of the altitude, is nothing else but the difference of degrees by which the altitude is found to be lesse then 90 degrees you must set one of the feet of your compasses in that degree of the Eccliptick that the Sun is in at that time, and with the other discribe a Circle upon the superficies of the Globe, tending somewhat toward the west, if the observation be taken before noon, but toward the east if it be made in the afternoon; then having made your Second observation, and observed the space of time betwixt it and the former, apply the place of the Sun to the Meridian, turning the Globe toward the East until that so many degrees of the Aequator have passed by the Meridian as answer to the space of time that passed betwixt your observations, allowing for every hour 15 degrees in the Aequator, and marking the place in the parallel of the Suns
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>declination, that the Meridian crosseth after this turning a∣bout of the Globe, and then setting the foot of your com∣passes in the very interfection, discribe an arch of a Circle with the other foot of the compasse, extended to the comple∣ment of the Second observation, which arch must cut the for∣mer Circle, and the common interfection of these two Cir∣cles, which shew the verticall point of the place wherein you are, so that having reckoned the distance of it from the Ae∣quator, you shall presently have the latitude of the same.</P>

<HEAD>How to make a Sun Dyall by the Globe for any latitude of place.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the making of a plaine Horizontall dyall, having first prepared your flat dyall ground parallel to the Horizon, draw a Meridian on it as exactly North and South as possibly you can, which done, draw another East and West, which must crosse it at right Angels; The first of which lines will shew 12, and the other 6 of the Clock both morning and evening. Then making a Center in the interfection of these two lines, describe a Circle on your dyall to what di∣stance you please, and then divide it as all othr Circles usu∣ally
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>are into 360 parts and it will not be amisse to sub-devide each of these into lesser parts if it may be conveniently done. And now it only remaines to finde out the distances of the houre lines in this Circle, for any latitude of place, which that we may doe by the use of the Globe, let it first be set to the Latitude of the place assigned, and then make choice of some of the greater Circles in the Globe that passe through the Poles of the world. As for example, The Aequinoctiall colour if you please, and apply the same to the Meridian, in which scituation it sheweth the mid-day, or 12 a Clock, then turning about the Globe toward the West (if you will) till that 15 degrees of the Aequator have passed through the Me∣ridian: you must marke the degree of the Horizon, that the same colour crosseth in the Horizon, for that point will shew the distance of the first and <HI>11th</HI> houres from the Meridian both of which are distant an hours space from the Meridian, or line of Mid-day; then turning againe the Globe forward till other fifteen degrees are past the Meridian, the same colour, will point out the distance of the <HI>10th</HI> hour, which is 2 hours before noon, and of the second hour after-noon; and in the same manner may you finde out the distances of all the rest in the Horizon, allotting to each of them 15 degrees in the Ae∣quator, crossing the Meridian; but here you must take notice by the way, that the beginning of this account of the distan∣ces, must be taken from that part of the Horizon on which the Pole is elevated, to wit, from the North-part of the Ho∣rizon, if the Artick Pole be elevate, and so likewise from the South part, if the Antartick be elevated.</P>
<P>The distances of the hours being thus noted in the Hori∣zon of the Globe, you must afterward translate them into your plaine allotted for your dyal ground, reckoning in the circumference of it so many degrees to each houre as are an∣swerable to those pointed out by the colour in the Horizon; and lastly, having thus, done the Gnomon or Stile must be e∣rected, where you are to observe this one thing, which is in∣deed the chief thing to be carefully looked unto, namely, that that edge or line of the Gnomon, which is to shew the hours by its shadow in all kinds of dyals must be set paralel to the Axis of the world, that so it may make an angle of inclina∣tion,
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>with its plaine ground equall to that which the Axis of the world makes with the Horizon, now that the stile is to stand directly to the North and South, or the Meridian line is a thing commonly knowne.</P>
<P>Now if you would make a plaine erect dyal perpendicular to the Horizon, which is commonly called a <HI>Mural,</HI> and re∣specting either the North or South, you must remember this one thing, that that which is an erect dyall in one place will be a Horizontall in another, whose Zenith is distant from that place 90 degrees either North-ward or South-ward.</P>
<P>And so likewise by this rule may be made any manner of inclining dyall, if so be that the quantity of the inclination be but knowne, as for example, if a dyall be made on a plain ground, whose inclination is ten degrees from the Horizon Southward, and for a place whose latitude is 52 gr. North-ward, you must describe it in that plaine and horizontall dial for the Latitude of 62 degrees North-ward, and if in the same Latitude the diall ground doe incline toward the North 16 gr. you must take in horizontall dial for the Northerne lati∣tude of 36 gr.</P>
