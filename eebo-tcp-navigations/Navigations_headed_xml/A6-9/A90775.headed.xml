<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>Iohnny Armstrong,</HI> OF <HI>WESTMORELAND,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>How in his youthful Days following Wars abroad in the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>and other Countries, he learned the Art of Arms, came off with great Success and Applause; and after his Return, settled at</HI> Guiltnock-hall, <HI>in</HI> Westmoreland; <HI>and of the noble Entertainment he gave to his hundred and sixty Men.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN former Times when the Wars were frequent be∣tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the two King∣doms were united in King <HI>James</HI> the First of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and Sixth of <HI>Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land,</HI> the bordering Countries, by reason of the Inroads that were made, were sometimes possessed by one Nation, and sometimes
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>by another; so that in these Contests there happened to live in <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> a brave and jolly Man named <HI>Johnny Armstrong,</HI> who made it his Business to keep up the good and laudible Customs of Charity, supplying the Poor with Cloaths and Food, not denying to any that asked; so that for his Liberality he was famed every where, and extreamly beloved by all, as well of his rich Neighbours as poor Ones; and though he had no free estate, yet there was such a Providence upon his Industry, which he used many ways, as in cloathing, buy∣ing and selling Forrests of Timber, breeding Cattle, and the like, that his Store vastly encreased, insomuch that a great many wondered how he could live at the rate he did, not well knowing how his Incomes should maintain it. For building a long Hall on purpose; he had a Table every Day furnished for eightscore Men, which he not only fed, but kept cloathed, and main∣tained in all other Marters; having Horse and Arms upon Occasion for the Defence of his Country, ready for them to mount, taking great Delight to exercise them, having been trained up a Soldier in foreign Lands, fighting against the Turks and Sarazens many Years in his youthful Days, and done great exploits which made him by many be stiled the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpion of the North, so that he kept the Borders very much in</P>
<P>His Mansion House was called <HI>Guilt-nock-hall,</HI> and his famed to this Day for his living in it, there being small Houses standing in the same Place, bearing the Name to this time; however, the larger Ruins shews it has been a Place very famous in former, for upon digging, the work∣men found the Foundations very spacious; and some of them have had the Luck to light upon earthern-pots,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>with the Coin of divers Kings, to the great inriching of them, and so they called it <HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI>'s Bounty∣money. Upon these things he imployed himself, till he was forty Years of Age, without being married, though several rich Offers were made to him of weal∣thy young Maidens; this made him consider of alter∣ing his Condition, not so much for the Desire of Mar∣riage, as he might get an Heir to keep up the Grandeur of his Hospitality, and to carry his Name to Posterity, as being defcended of a very ancient and worthy Fa∣mily, some of which are living to this Day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How being settled, vnd living gallantly, he bethought him∣self of Marriage, and fell in Love with a Gentleusan's Daughter of ao Fortune; and of the sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endid Enter∣tainment he made; and how thereupon he was taken for the King,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HIs Thoughts about Marriage were no sooner known, but out of the Respect the Gentry and others in the Country had for him, many suitable Matches were proposed; but as for Riches he lightly regarded it, relying mainly on the bounties of Pro∣videhce, he resolved to choose out one Handsome, In∣genious and Virtuous; and so it was not long e're he saw One as he was passing through a Market-Town, that he could fancy; and upon Inquiry, found she was a Gentleman's Daughter, though of a mean Fortune, her Father being fallen much to Decay, by the Losses he had received by the War between the two Nations, in his Estate and Goods: But this made no Difference between them, the Gentlemah was was glad to put his
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>Daughter off so well, and <HI>Johnny</HI> was as well pleased he had met with a virtuous modest Woman, not with∣out a Sufficiency of beauty to please him well enough; and the Day being appointed, he promised to come and marry her, and so fetch her home to his House. And in order to this, he arrayed his eightscore Men in Purple, laced all with Gold and Silver-Lace, with Silver-hilted Swords, embroider'd Belts, guilded Spurs, and Plumes of white Feathers in their Bonnets, and bravely mounted, he rid in most gallant Attire at the Head of them; so that the People through the Towns as he passed, taking him for the King, they run be∣fore him, throwing up their Hats, and shouting; nor could they hardly be persuaded by himself to the con∣trary.</P>
<P>His fair Mistress was of the same Opinion, when looking out at the Window, upon the knoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing at the Gate, and seeing her father's House surrounded with so gallant a Troop, fancying it could be none else, and that he might be a hunting in those Parts, and so came thither for entertainment; upon this she run and waked her Father, it being yet early, and told him the King was come with a numerous Train to visit him.</P>
<P><HI>God forbid,</HI> said he, <HI>what shall we do then? We shall be undone, for all our Provisions for thy Wedding will not be a Mouthful for them. Indeed the house looks fair and promising without, though my mean Fortune can allow but lean Coasmons. Go down and tell them I am not at home, I am sick, or any thing to put them off; for better so, than pretend to entertain them, when we cannot do it; better strain a Complement, than to be disgraced, or at least fast I know not how long after.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<P>Upon this, down she went, and peeping thro' the Wicket, demanded what brought them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Father's House; to which <HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI> replyed, My Pro∣mise to you, that I would this Day make you my Wife. Upon this, knowing his Voice, and looking wishfully on him, she could not but fancy him to be what before she had thought, till he alighted, and sa∣luted her kindly, assuring her he was no other than <HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI> of <HI>Guiltnock-hall,</HI> in <HI>Westmoreland.</HI> Upon this throwing open the Gates, she conducted him in, and run up to tell the Business, vvhereupon her Father coming down, kindly vvelcomed him. But vvhen he favv his Train, he blessed himself, to knovv vvhat he meant by bringing such a number of Men so bravely accutred, fancying he had invited all the Gentlemen in ten Countries: But when he told him they vvere such as usually attended him vvhen he went upon any important Affair, his Wonder yet more en∣creased, for though he had heard he had daily relieved abundance of Poor, he could not believe he could keep so many Men in that Garb.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>NOW Matters being at this pass, the Pages had the Care of the horses, vvhilst the Men light to refresh themselves; though all the Liquor in the house was not a Morning's Draught for them; vvhich made the old Gentleman, the Father conclude that this vvould be a Fasting-day of a Wedding. But vvhilst these Doubts and Fears shook him like a Palsie, all on a sudden arrived <HI>Armstrong</HI>'s Cooks and Scullions, tvventy in Number, with a Carrivan
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>of Provision ready to dress: after them his Butlers, being eight, with another of Wine, Cyder, Ale, and other Liquor; so that it seemed, when taken out, a Plenty sufficient to have supplyed a little City against a Siege. So to work went the Cooks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whilst he and his Bride, bravely mounted, rode attended by his Men to the Church, making such a Show as that Country had never before seen. The People upon Notice of it, coming far and near to be Spectators, some giving out, especially the ignorant Sort, that E∣squire <HI>Leonard</HI>'s Daughter had married the King for certain; for as he came out of the Church, he gave a hundred Mark to be distributed among the Poor, which they fancied none but a King could or at least would do.</P>
<P>When they came home, after the Wine of divers Nations had gone briskly about, they found the Tables covered with all manner of Varieties that Sea, Earth, or Air could afford, as, Fowl, Fish, Flesh, Fruits, and other Dainties; and yet above half was not brought in, so that they were obliged, for want of Room in the House, to have Tables spread in the Court-yard. For the Porter was ordered to make Proclamation, That all Comers should be welcome that Day; and so till Night they drank and feasted plentifully; and then his Musick and his Masqueraders to divert the Com∣pany till Bed-time; though indeed there was not Lodg∣ing for a fortieth part of them, so that open House was kept all Night. And he finding the ill Conveni∣niency of staying there longer, took his leave of his Father-in-law the next Morning, and conveyed his fair Bride home with him in great State, and with her li∣ved very happily, supplying her Father's Wants on all
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>Occasions with Provision and Money, and made him live very comfortably.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>How having carried his fair Bride home, she was magni∣ficiently entertained: How soon after he had divers Encounters with the Scots, and thereupon a War ari∣sing between the two Nations, after the Battle at</HI> Ban∣nock<HI>'s Bourn,</HI> Westmoreland <HI>fell into their Hands.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEing now at home, he so settled all things in good Order in that Country, that the King of <HI>England</HI> sent him Thanks for the Care he had in pro∣tecting Passengers from Robbers and Thieves, as like∣wise from the plundering Scots, which he made many times go short home, wherefore they mortally ha∣ted him, and layed some Designs to intrap him, but having his Guard of merry old true hearted Blades with him, he always came off with flying Colours. And during these Transactions his Wife was brought to Bed of a fair Son, which much rejoyced Parents Hearts, so that holding a Feast at his Christening, all the Country in a manner, so that the Fame of it rung far and near.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Joy, he had Notice, that a Party of Scots were advanced within ten Miles of his Seat, ravaging and plundering the Country, so that the People came flying before them a pace; but he and his Men mounting, gave them Battle on the Borders of the Country, and overthrew them with so woful a Slaughter, that very few returned to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> (which Garrison in those Days the Scots held) to tell of the Defeat.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<P>These, and such like Encounters and Depradations, caused an open War between the two Nations, which had been stilled for a Time; and King <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> marched towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> and entred it with a mighty Army, but very ill disciplin'd; for the Scotch Historians tell us they were a hundred thousand, besides Women, Lackeys, and other Servants, many carry∣ing their whole families with them to settle, when <HI>Scotland</HI> should be over-run. But <HI>Fortune</HI> was here a∣gainst the English, by reason of their Security and O∣ver-confidence in their Number, for in a mortal battle at a Place called <HI>Bannock's Bourn, Robert,</HI> the Scots King setting upon 'em, utterly vanquish'd 'em with a lesser Number, killing about ten thousand of them, with the Earl of <HI>Glouc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster</HI> and two hundred Knights, Squires; and on the Scots side about six thousand were killed, with divers Nobles and Gentlemen, so that they pursu∣ing their Success, won <HI>Westmoreland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI> Our famous <HI>Armstrong</HI> was not at this Battle, but was much surprized at it, and would have persuaded the re∣treating English, to whose Aid he was coming, to ral∣ly and face about; but wanting a warlike Prince to lead them, it proved ineffectual; and now he sound him∣self constrained to become a Subject to the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or leave his fair Seat, which he resolved not do, though his Wife and his Father in-law main<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y per∣suaded him to it, considering how much he had done against that Nation, and that he could not well expect but now it was in their Power they would not forget it: But he being of an undaunted Courage, told them, that he had been brought up a Soldier, and what he had done,
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>was according to the Law of Arms, and that even a ge∣nerous Enemy could not but approve it: Besides, in a little time all might be won back again by the English; and therefore he not being used to despair in Provi∣dence, or subject to fear, would not remove from a Place he so dearly loved upon Suggestions of Dan∣gers that might ever happen, least the World might impute to him a Cowardice he was never guilty of.</P>
<P>These Words put them Silence, and he still went on in his own generous Way of Living, keeping open House, and doing all the Good he could even to the Poor of either nation without Indifferency, that no Exceptions might be taken, or he be branded with Par∣tiality.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>How being persuaded to leave</HI> Guiltnock-hall, <HI>and retire from the Scottish Revenge, being refused for many Rea∣son; and great Commotions arising by the landing of the Danes and Redshanks, he was suspected upon the false Accusvtion of a Lord: How the King invited him to</HI> Edenborough, <HI>to destroy him, and he promsed to go.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DUring these Stirs, the Danes and Redshanks, two bloody Northern Nations, made great Havock in the Western Isles of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they had landed, and with them joyned some of the discon∣tented Scots, as well Noblemen as others, so that the King knew not who to trust, since some proved treacherous on whom he seemed mostly to rely; this vexed him, and made him suspicious even of his Friends, so that he imprisoned many of them out
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>of Fear they should joyn with the English, who were making Preparations to recover what they had so shamefully lost; or with the Northern Enemy, to whom flocked a great many Outlaws and idle Persons, who supposed in the midst of Spoil and Plunder, they should be enriched with the Goods and Chattels that others had industriously laboured for.</P>
<P>These Proceedings made many of the Great Ones whom he sent to, refuse to come to him, least they should be clapt up as the others had been; and then what Accusations might be brought falsly against them they know not.</P>
<P>This made him clap his Hand on his Breast, looking on those that were about him, and with a Sigh, said, <HI>Ah! is</HI> Scotland <HI>so full of Treachery, that never a Man from the highest to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owest Degree, dare appear before his King when he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds for him.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon an Officer of his Houshold standing up, and then bowing low said, <HI>May it please your Majesty, there is one, named</HI> John Armstrong <HI>in</HI> Westmoreland, <HI>a valiant and trusty Man, whom I doubt not may do you Service. What is he,</HI> said the King, <HI>or his Ability? Why,</HI> replyed the Officer, <HI>he lives very splendidly, gives Noble Entertainment to all Comers, and yet I never heard he had any Land to maintain it. Then,</HI> said the King, <HI>he must live by Plunder and Robbery; and of such there are too many in the Kingdom already. But does he keep any Men to attend him? Yes,</HI> replyed the other, <HI>he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ways in intains eightscore gallant Fellows, bravely attired; and when he goes abroad, they ride with him well mounted and armed.</HI></P>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<P>Whilst this Dialogue held, in came a Lord whom <HI>Armstrong</HI> and his Men had a little before the Fight at <HI>Bannock's Bourn</HI> routed on the Borders, and rescued a great Booty of Cattle taken from the poor English Coun∣try People, and challenged him to single Combat, but he durst not answer him. Of this mortal Enemy of his the King demanded, if he knew one <HI>Johnny Armstrong,</HI> of <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> and what he was? <HI>Know him,</HI> re∣plied he, <HI>Yes, may it please your Majesty, and so does all your poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubjects on the other, and this side the</HI> Tweed; <HI>he has been a bitter Enemy to our Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and is like to be so again, when the English, who now I hear are prepa∣paring to make an Attempt upon it; and unless your Ma∣jesty can get him into your Hands, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stroy him, and the Nest of Rebels he keeps, your new Conquests can never be secured to you.</HI></P>
<P>This false and malicious Report so incensed the King against this just and valiant Man, that he resolved, if possible, his Destruction, without enquiring further into the Matter; purposing to go with Forces, and im∣mediately fall upon him: But that was objected against lest, upon notice of the March, he should retire into the English Territories, and become yet a more im∣placable Enemy: Therefore it was thought adviseable in a secret Council, called to that purpose, he should be sent for to <HI>Edenborough</HI> under fair pretences of friend∣ship, and there he and his Train he brought with him, might be cut off without much Resistance.</P>
<P>This was agreed on as proper, whereupon the King writ to him the following Letter:</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>WE having heard much of the Fame of you, our dear and loving Subject, and your great Bounty, and many singular Vertues, have raised such Admiration in us, that we could do no less at this time, then take Notice of one who is beloved of the common People, and may be so greatly serviceable to us, when things go so badly; Therefore I will not command, but earnestly require you on the sight of this our Letter to repair to us at our City of</HI> Edenborough, <HI>with your Attendance, where you shall be heartily welcome. And for your safe Conduct, this our Letter, with our Royal Word and solemn Promise, shall be a sufficient Pledge and Secu∣rity.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Robert Rex.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter was sealed with the King's Signet, and sent with all secresie and speed, which he received as he came from Hunting; and having highly treated the Messenger, and giving him his Promise to wait on the King on the Morrow, he dismissed him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>How he went bravely attended with his eightscore Men to</HI> Edenborough, <HI>notwithstanding many Presages that forbid it: The Discourse he had with the King, who charging him wrongfully as a Traytor, and ordering him and his Men to be hanged, they fought with the King's Guards, the whole City in a bloody Battle, till they were all slain but his Page; and how his little Son promised to revenge his Father's Death.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe valiant <HI>John Armstrong</HI> being at this Invitation a little puzled to think what the Reason should be and therefore communicated it to his Friends, to have
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>their Opinions; but they were as much in the dark as himself; but since he had received the King's Letter of Conduct, and passed his Word to go, they concluded (all but his Wife, who was full of Fear for him) that it would be convenient for him to fulfill his Promise.</P>
<P>Whereupon he ordered his Men to be ready the next Morning, and to put on their best Apparel, which were Velvet Coats lac'd with three broad Gold Laces, and Scarlet Cloaks with five of Silver, as the most modish Fashion of those times, was also to put on their gold em∣broidered Belts, which were made to hang over their Shoulders, and every one a Falchion by his Side, with a silver Handle, a Buckler of Steel, and a plume of white Feathers in their Hats or Bonnets. The Emblem of them that they unluckily went into War and Mischief.</P>
<P>His Commands were not disputed, but in the Morn∣ing they were up with the Sun, and immediately had put themselves in array to march; when all on a sudden the glorious Luminary, that shone so bright at his as∣cending our Horizon, was clouded and overcast, and Thunders began to rumble in the Air, which was the Fore-runner of Rain and Whirlwinds; however, there being some Signs of clearing up, he resolved to set for∣ward, but coming to take his leave of his dearly beloved Wife and little Son, and giving them many tender Kis∣ses and Embraces, Tears trickled from his Eyes, con∣trary to their wonted Use, and his manly Courage fail∣ed him, and all on a sudden he grew sad and melan∣cholly; without being able to give any Reason for it. But his Wive's Intreaties and his Son's Tears, were too weak to stay him; so with kind Farewels they parted as they hoped, but for a time, but it proved a long one.</P>

<P>As they rid through several Towns, the People slock∣ed to see their Bravery; at last they came to the flowery Banks of <HI>Tweed,</HI> which part rightly <HI>Scotland</HI> from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and is its Boundary, over which River they passed by a Foard, and so rod on towards <HI>Edenborough,</HI> send∣ing word before of his coming, least so great a Troop might make the City shut their Gates on a sudden, for fear of a Surprize.</P>
<P>The King no sooner had notice of this, but he placed his Guards to be ready on the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder to execute his Commands; but when he came to his Prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so nobly attended, he began to doubt it might be a mistaken Ru∣mour of <HI>Armstrong</HI>'s coming, fancying it might rather be some foreign Prince come to pay him a Visit; where∣fore upon his low bowing, the King moved his Bonnet to him in a courteous manner, bidding him stand up; but he was no sooner certified it was he, e're the kind Language was turned into the hateful Names of Villain Traytor, Enemy to <HI>Scotland,</HI> Thief, Robber, and much more of this unexpected Language, which something startled him; whereupon he bending one Knee to the Ground, begged Pardon if he had done any thing that had offended his Majesty; but as for his coming thither it was in Obedience to his Letter, which promised him better Entertainment, and safe Conduct, and therefore desired to know to what end he was sent for, tendring his Service if it might be accepted. No, Traytor, repli∣ed he, in a Rage, I need not thy Service, and as for the fair Promises in my Letter, 'twas to decoy you and your Nest of Thieves hither; and lastly, the Cause of sending for you, was to hang you and your Men; which shall be done by eight of the Clock to morrow Morning. At this, the bold English Man rising up unconcerned, with∣out
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>out fear desired he might justifie himself and his Men and be cleared of the false Report his Majesty had per∣haps received of them. But the Lord who first accus'd him and some of his Creatures incensing the King a∣gainst him, it was denyed, and the Guards which were about two thoufand, had the Signal to drag them to Goal, and the next Morning to execute them.</P>
<P><HI>Hah,</HI> says <HI>Armstrong, hast thou thus broke thy Word with me, thus basely to ensnare and destroy me and my Men. Well, we are Men, and like Men we will die, if it must be so, and</HI> Scotland <HI>shall buy our Lives at a dear rate.</HI> Upon that, looking behind him, and encouraging his Follow∣ers to take Example by him, he drew his trusty Sword, and making at the King through the thick of his Guards struck at him with such Fury, that he had taken off his Head at the Stroak, had he not nimbly avoided by fal∣ling on the Ground. <HI>Armstrong</HI>'s Men seeing their Lea∣der engaged among so many Swords, immediately drew; and so laid about them that all the Place was slippery with Blood; driving those that remained unslain out of the Palace into the open Streets; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lst the Cry arose through all the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, as if it had been taken by Storm; so that at last three thousand more coming upon the He∣roick <HI>Armstrong,</HI> being tired with the Slaughter of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Enemies, and faint w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Wounds and loss of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood, af∣ter some staggering, fell to the Ground; yet calling to his Men, encouraged them to fight on for after he had bled a little, he would rise and help them again. This made them like enraged Lions, so that Heaps of dead bodies barred up their way; till at last over-powered by fresh Numbers, and seeing no way of an honourable Re∣treat; they all, like valiant Men, dyed in their Master's Cause, leaving a bloody Victory, for there fell by their
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>Hands two thousand five hundred Citizens and Soldiers. The King the mean while was retired to a strong-hold for Shelter; and only of <HI>Armstrong</HI>'s Party a little Page e∣scaped, to tell the dismal News; at which the Mourning of his Wife and all that Country made for his untime∣ly Fall, is more than we can relate: However, his lit∣tle Son sitting on his Nurse's Knee, vowed to revenge his Death, which, being a Man, he as gallantly performed,</P>

<HEAD><HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI>'s last Good-night.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IS there never a Man in all <HI>Scotland,</HI></L>
<L>from the highest estate to the lowest degree,</L>
<L>That can show himself now before the King,</L>
<L><HI>Scotland</HI> is so full of Treachery?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, there is a Man in <HI>Westmoreland,</HI></L>
<L>and <HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI> they do him call,</L>
<L>He has no lands nor rents coming in,</L>
<L>yet he keeps eightscore men within his hall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He has Horses and harness for them all,</L>
<L>and goodly steads that be milk white,</L>
<L>With their goodly belts about their necks,</L>
<L>with hats and feathers all alike.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King he writes a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oving letter,</L>
<L>and with his own hand so tenderly,</L>
<L>And hath sent it unto <HI>Johnny Armstrong,</HI></L>
<L>to come and speak with <HI>him</HI> speedily.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>John</HI> he looked this Letter upon,</L>
<L>good Lord, he lookt as blith as a bird in a tree,</L>
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
<L>I was never before a King in my life,</L>
<L>my Father, my Grandfather, nor none of us three.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But seeing we must go before the King,</L>
<L>O we will go most gallantly:</L>
<L>Ye shall every one have a Velvet-coat,</L>
<L>laid down with golden laces three.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And ye shall every one have a scarlet Cloak</L>
<L>laid down with silver laces five,</L>
<L>With your golden belts about your necks,</L>
<L>with hats and brave feathers all alike.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when <HI>John</HI> he went from <HI>Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tnock-h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll,</HI></L>
<L>the wind it blew hard, and full fast it did rain,</L>
<L>Now fare thee well thou <HI>Guiltnock-hall,</HI></L>
<L>I fear I shall never see thee again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now <HI>Johnny</HI> is to <HI>Edenborough</HI> gone,</L>
<L>with his eightscore Men so gallantly,</L>
<L>And every one of them a milk white steed,</L>
<L>with their bucklers and swords hanging on their knee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when <HI>John</HI> came the King before,</L>
<L>with eightscore Men so gallant to see,</L>
<L>The King he mov'd his bonnet to him;</L>
<L>he thought he had been a King as well as he.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Pardon, Pardon, my Sovereign Leige,</L>
<L>pardon for my eightscore Men and me,</L>
<L>For my name it is <HI>Johnny Armstrong,</HI></L>
<L>and a Subject of yours, my Liege, said he.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
<LG>
<L>Away with thee, thou false Traytor,</L>
<L>no Pardon will I grant to thee,</L>
<L>But to morrow morning by eight of the clock,</L>
<L>I will hang up thy eightscore Men and thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Johnny</HI> look't over his left Shoulder,</L>
<L>and to his merry Men thus said he,</L>
<L>I have asked Grace of a graceless Face,</L>
<L>no Pardon there is for you or me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>John</HI> pull'd out his trusty Sword,</L>
<L>and it was made of Mettle so free,</L>
<L>Had not the King mov'd his foot as he did</L>
<L><HI>John</HI> had taken his head from his fair Body.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come follow me my merry Men all,</L>
<L>we will scorn one Foot for to fly,</L>
<L>It shall ne'er be said we were hung like Dogs,</L>
<L>we will fight it out so manfully.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then they fought on like Champions bold,</L>
<L>for their hearts were sturdy, stout and free,</L>
<L>Till they had kill'd the King's good Guard,</L>
<L>there was none left alive but two or three.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But then rose up all <HI>Edenborough,</HI></L>
<L>they rose up by thousands three,</L>
<L>A cowardly <HI>Scot</HI> came <HI>Johnny</HI> behind,</L>
<L>and run him thorow the fair body.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Said <HI>John,</HI> Fight on my merry Men all,</L>
<L>I am a little wounded but am not slain,</L>
<L>I will lay me down for to bleed a while,</L>
<L>then I'll rise and fight with you again.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
<LG>
<L>Then they fought on like mad Men all,</L>
<L>till many a Man lay dead upon the Plain,</L>
<L>For they were resolved before they would yield,</L>
<L>that every Man should there be slain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So there they fought courageously,</L>
<L>till most of them lay dead there and slain,</L>
<L>But little <HI>Musgrove</HI> that was his Foot-page,</L>
<L>with his bonny Grizel got away untain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when he came to <HI>Guiltnock-hall,</HI></L>
<L>the Lady spied him presently,</L>
<L>What news, what news, thou little foot Page,</L>
<L>what news from thy Master and his Company.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My news is bad, Lady, he said,</L>
<L>which I do bring, as you may see,</L>
<L>My Master <HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI> is slain,</L>
<L>and all his gallant Company.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet thou art welcome home my bonny Grizel,</L>
<L>full oft thou hast been fed with Corn and Hay,</L>
<L>But now thou shalt be fed with bread and wine,</L>
<L>and thy sides shall be spurr'd no more I say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O then bespake his little Son,</L>
<L>as he sat on his Nurse's Knee,</L>
<L>If ever I live to be a Man,</L>
<L>my Father's Death reveng'd shall be.</L>
