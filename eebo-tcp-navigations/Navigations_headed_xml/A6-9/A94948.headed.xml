<HEAD>A True and Perfect Relation of a Strange and Monstrous <HI>Whale,</HI> cast upon the Shore at <HI>Rings-End</HI> near <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the begin∣ning of <HI>January 1678/9.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your more weighty Imployments, to which great Worth and approved Abilities have de∣servedly called you, can admit of any Diver∣tisement, I hope you will not take it ill if I en∣deavour to contribute towards it: Especially having Engaged my self to give a just and due ac∣count of such Occurrenc s as in this juncture of Af∣fairs shall happen here in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>I should be loath to disturb your more serious hours with Feigned Rumours, <HI>Chymaeras</HI> and Prodi∣gious Trisles of that nature to make up a Pamphlet;
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>but such things as have really happen'd, and are wor∣thy of Observation; and whereof many thousands in this Nation have been Witnesses, I may be the more confident to relate as real Truths; and consequent∣ly more fit to be communicated to your Knowledge.</P>
<P>About the latter end of the last Month, the year ended in an Angry humour; God grant the next may shine upon us with more Benevolent Stars, and Crown the best of Kings His most Gracious Majesty, with Length of dayes, Happy ensuing years, against all the malice of His Enemies and Envious Conspirators.</P>
<P>On the 22d. of <HI>December</HI> last, the Wind being at W.S.W. it blew a great Storm, but we heard of no loss of Shipping, only some few Merchantmen that fell foul one of another in our Harbour. This high Wind brought down such a vast quantity of Snow, as hath not been seen in this Country for many years; which in few dayes being washt away with the abundance of Rain that succeeded, and the great Floods that fell from the Mountains, caused so great a Fresh, that several Meadows and Islands about the River <HI>Liffy</HI> were overflown.</P>
<P>But what was the most remarkable and worthy Ob∣servation in this Occurrence, was a man who Swom down the River on a Hay-Cock. This man near a place called <HI>Killmanum</HI> near <HI>Dublin</HI> above the Bridge, en∣deavouring to save a Cock of Hay that the Water
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/>had encompassed, leapt thereon with a Pole in his hand; his Ship was now afloat, and he had no sooner got one foot aboard, but he was lanched forth into the main Current, and driven on with that success, that he past the Bridge without any Damage: When he arrived on the other side the Bridge, there were se∣veral Attempts made to save him, but the Rapidness of the Stream would admit of no help; only one Boat, which meeting full side with the Hay-Cook, was over∣turn'd with two men it, who were both lost. At last more obliged to Providence then his skill in Steerage, when he expected no less then the Main Ocean for his Re∣fuge, he was left in a safe Harbour on <HI>Clantarf</HI> Island betwixt <HI>Clantarf</HI> and <HI>Rings-end.</HI></P>
<P>This Adventure of the Hay-Merchant was the whole Discourse and wonder of the Town, and had conti∣nued so yet, if the Sea, more fertile in Monstrous Productions then the Land, had not afforded them new cause of Admiration: For the next day, (as if the Floods were weary of their Load and willing to dis∣charge themselves of so great a Burden) was thrown on the Shore a <HI>Whale</HI> of so vast a Magnitude, as never yet was discover'd in these parts, or hardly ever seen in <HI>Bermudas</HI> their Native Coast.</P>
<P>It was taken up by <HI>Rings-end,</HI> within two Miles of <HI>Dublin,</HI> where it lyes as yet, the wonder and amaze∣ment of all Spectators, who flock from all parts both of City and Country to satisfie their Curiosity with the sight of this Prodigious Spectacle.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y"/>
<P>This Immense Body of boundless Natures begetting, as it exceeds all other Creatures in quantity of it ex∣ceeds almost all possibility of inforcing a belief of the vastness of its Dimensions on any save those only that have been Spectators, and which I would not under∣take to describe unto you, had I not my self been an Eye Witness.</P>
<P>It is in Length 52 Foot, in Breadth proportionable, the Tail is 14 Foot broad when it is extended, the Fins of a Prodigious Length and Breadth, and the Head an∣swerable to the Bulk of the Body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his upper Jawes are supported from the under part of his Mouth with a Beam of Oke of eight Foot long; the Tongue was in Length eight Foot and a half, of a proportionable Tinck∣ness and Breadth; The Tongue being cut ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I have seen many people pass through his Jawes, and several stand upright in his Mouth at the same time.</P>
<P>But the most surprizing thing was this, when they had Dissected him of several Shoales of Fish, which they found in his Belly of all sorts whole and Undi¦gested, together with a Seaman intire in his Cloaths, (which being laid on the Shore by the side of the said <HI>Whale</HI>) was soon discovered by his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and several other st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>ing by, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be one of the two men that were overturnd by the Hay-Cock the day before.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/>
<P>Many strange Conjectures have been made of this prodigious Bulk; Astronomers and Astrologers have past their Judgments upon it, and scarce an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wife of Cobler in Town but have had something to say to it; and no doubt but it will serve the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with Rashers and Discourse for many dayes to come.</P>
<P>But for my part, all the Prediction I shall draw from it; is that our Kings most Sacred Majesty shall be now restored to a state of greater Glory and Security, (as he was formerly) to his lawful Kingdoms and Loyal People; delivered from the hands of all His Enemies and Bloody Conspirators, against the Life and Sacred Person of so Good, so Gracious, and so Indulgent a Prince.</P>
<P>Their design being to Subvert Monarchy, and alter the Government, which by God and the Laws are Established in these His Majesties Realms.</P>
<P>Such a <HI>Whale</HI> was cast up in <HI>England</HI> in the time of the late Usurpation, a little before the time of His Majesties blessed Restoration: And another was cast ashore at <HI>Carrig-Fergus</HI> in the North of this Country in the year 40. but that was very small in Comparison of this.</P>
<P>And we His Majesties Faithful Subjects do heartily wish here, that this Miraculous Prodigy cast on this
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>Shore, may be a true Omen, and Presage the Down∣fal of all such as were Consenters, Abetters, or Con∣trivers for carrying on this Horrible Plot, either against our most Gracious King or Government, whom that God may long preserve against all their Conspiracies, is the Hearty Prayers and Wishes of</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Affectionate Friend and Humble Servant. <HI>J. M.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
