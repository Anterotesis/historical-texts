<HEAD>A TRUE RELATION OF The taking of a ship sent from the Queen <HI>out of Holland to his Maiesty, October the</HI> 4.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N Thursday the sixth of October, a packet of Letters was brought to the House of Commons, &amp; from thence referred to the close Co∣mittee for the defence of the Kingdome, which came from <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and came out of <HI>Holland</HI> from the Queen which were intercepted in this manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>England</HI> having bought a ship with her own money, sent the same over into <HI>England</HI> with ten pieces of Ordnance, and forty or fifty bar∣rels of powder, and a hundred and fifty Cavaleers
<PB REF="3"/>which were to land at New Castle, and from thence to be conveyed to his Majesty, the King of Great Britain.</P>
<P>But when the said ship c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me neere to New-castle, she was driven in at <HI>YARMOVTH</HI> by a contrary wind, and when the Cavaleers that were in the said ship perceived that there was no remedy, but that they must come into Yarmouth, where they knew they should be searched, and all their intentions made frustrate, they began to bethink with them∣selves, that it was better to dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vad all their Letters, then to put it to the hazzard of having all their Se∣crets come to light,</P>
<P>And thereupon they agreed, that they would sink their Packet of Letters in the Sea, before they came to Land,</P>
<P>And for the better effecting of this, they put into the packer two or three bullets, and so threw them into the Sea, which being perceived by a Fisherman that was in a small boat neere to the ship, the said Fisherman dived after it into the Water being well acquainted with the depth of the Waters in that place) and took up the said Packet of Letters, and presented them to the Governours of Yar∣mouth.</P>
<P>VVhereupon the said Governours immediately resolved to send them to the Honourable Court of <HI>PARLIAMENT</HI> the great Councell of this King∣dome, which was this present day being the sixth of this instant month of October presented to the house of Commons, the worthy Members of the said House gave order and Command, that they
<PB REF="3"/>should be referred to the close Committee, which was accordingly performed, and at the opening of the same, there was one Letter sent from the Queen in <HI>HOLLAND</HI> to the Kings most excellent Maje∣sty, as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>That her Maiesty intends to be in England very speedily, having fourteen of the Hollan∣ders ships ready provided for her conduct into ENGLAND, together with divers other Let∣ters, the particulars whereof are not as yet known.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was also informed to the House, that the said ships and the Cavaleers, and other provi∣sion of Warre that were in the said ship were seized upon at Yarmouth, and there detained custody, untill they receive further Directions from the Parliament,</HI></P>
<P>This is the true and perfect Relation that came to both Houses upon Thursday, being the sixth of October.</P>

<HEAD>A true Relation of Master <HI>Hothaws</HI> taking of <HI>Keywood</HI> Castle.</HEAD>
<P>THis day Newes came to the House out of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> that Master <HI>Ho∣tham</HI> disclaimed any consent or a∣greement to the Articles of a peace be∣tween the Earie of <HI>Comberland</HI> and the Lord <HI>Fairefax</HI> and the rest of the Gentry of the County of <HI>Yorke:</HI> And that for said agreement Master <HI>Hotham</HI> with his Forces tooke the Town of <HI>Selby,</HI> and hath stopped the passage of all boats to <HI>Yorke,</HI> and taken a strong Castle called <HI>Keywood,</HI> belonging to the Bishop of that Diece, and resolves to maintaine his Majesties Pretogative, the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, the Lawes of the Kingdom and the Liberty and propriety of the sub∣ject
<PB REF="4"/>according to the Instructions sent un∣to them of that County from the Parlia∣ment, he being of opinion, that the Arti∣cles agreed upon are prejudiciall to the whole Kingdome, and of that County in particular, and that no one County ought to withdraw themselves from the com∣mon cause, bue to aime with the Parlia∣ment in the defence of the Kingdome, and with them to labour by all good meanes to procure a generall peace and protection from the King, for all his subjects with both the Houses of Parliament, have by many humble Petitions desired by His Majestie but cannot yet obteyne.</P>
<P>And according to the Parliaments De∣claration, if they should suffer any parti∣cular Counties to divide themselves from the rest of the Kingdome, it will be a meanes to bring all to tuine and destruct∣ion, and therfore the said Mr. <HI>Hotham</HI> is ready with those forces that he brought with him from <HI>Hull</HI> to assist the Parlia∣ment in this cause which newes was very
<PB REF="5"/>acceptable to the House, in regard that they had voted the said agreement to be void, because it was destructive to the peace of the Kingdome, and agreed that the <HI>L.
