<HEAD>NECESSARY OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING DOVER, AND OTHER SEA-TOWNS OF <HI>ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>OVER with her Castle hath (by Ancients) been accounted, The lock and key to the whole Realme of <HI>England.</HI> Likewise the five Ports, together with the two ancient Townes annexed, or incorporated into the same; with their seaven members, have all of them been places of great strength and importance; and con∣sequently, have therefore obtained many great priviledges. In this Latine Verse next ensuing (unfitting to be in this obser∣vation omitted) are all the said fourteen Haven Townes set forth.</P>
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Hastingus, Dover, Sandwicus, Romneus, Hithus,</L>
<L>Sunt Portus. Villae antiquae, Rya, Frigmare ventus.</L>
<L>Villa februm, gentis saxum, pelagi vada, Lydda,</L>
<L>Fordwich, Tenterden, Penensea, membra notantur.</L></Q>
<P>Englished, <Q><HI>Hasting, Dover, Sandwich, Romney,</HI> and <HI>Hith,</HI> are the Cinque or five Ports, <HI>Rye</HI> and <HI>Winchelsea</HI> are the two ancient Townes, united and incorporated into the same priviledges the said Cinque-Ports enjoy.</Q></P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P> <HI>Feversham, Foulkston, Sea-ford, Lydd, Fordwich, Tenterden,</HI> and <HI>Pevensey,</HI> are the Five Ports, and two ancient Townes, severall members, besides <HI>Deale. Walmer.</HI> Very many Villages and Pa∣rishes in the Island of <HI>Thanet</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and some elsewhere, enjoying the same liberties and priviledges for the Lands de∣fence.</P>
<P>The Castles of <HI>Dover, Sandowne, Deale, Walmer, Sandgate, Camber, Moates-Bulwarke,</HI> and <HI>Archcliff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Bulwarke▪</HI> these many yeares now past, have been much decayed in their several Ma∣gazens of Armes, and all sorts of warlike Munition, which have heretofore been kept and continually very well supported and maintained; as not onely honourable, strong, and defensible Forts, standing next unto the Seas, being Frontiers of this Realme; but also so necessary Fortifications for the defence and safeguard of the same, that they have alwayes been repaired, and with Munition continually supplyed, for the publique de∣fence of this Kingdome, yet of late yeares have wanted much provision of abiliaments for Warre, or warlike defence; besides all the defects in store. A part of the North Wall of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle since the yeare 1637. by tempestuous or such like wea∣ther, hath fallen downe into the Castle-trench. Likewise much of the Leads of the Kings lodgings in the said Castle have by boysterous tempests and great winds, blown quite up to the top of the stone-worke thereof, and some blowne over it; impairing the who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Tymber Fabricke underneath, to the great prejudice of <HI>Englands</HI> somtimes glorious &amp; formidable Common-wealth; notwithstanding, the severall provisions, stores, and Magazens of the said Castles, &amp;c. have been of late much decayed, have little or nothing been replenished.</P>
<P>At the first comming of the <HI>Spanish</HI> great Fleete of Warre in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> 1639. into the narrow Seas, and in∣to the Kings Chamber, there so called; The said severall Ca∣stles. Bulwarks, and places of Defence, were all, or most of them, without any strength formidable before the face of so strong and mightie a Fleete, or any power resistable, if an attempt had been performed by the vast and War-like <HI>Spanish</HI>-Fleete afore∣said; but contrariwise, in very weake plight and dolefull state, even in depaire of loosing the most part of the Sea-Townes
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>and Fortifications neere <HI>Dover,</HI> the <HI>Downes,</HI> and elsewhere, if not the dangerous destruction of the whole Island, nay, the whole Kingdome.</P>
<P>For further demonstration of the Castles and Sea-coasts se∣verall weaknesses, three hundred land-souldiers were appointed out of the said five Ports, Haven-Towns, and Members to be raised for pursuite of the <HI>Scots</HI> in that late expedition, if they had been compelled unto, and to march away from the said Ports, had been a designe onely to weaken, the then weake and too weak, sea-coasts for such a time of action: heretofore they have been accounted the keyes of <HI>England,</HI> yet at that time of emi∣nent danger, they might well have been esteemed, the Destru∣ction of <HI>England.</HI> Had we not been then by the <HI>Holland</HI> Navie defended (as one well termed it, the scourge of <HI>Spaine</HI>) whom together with us were protected by the divine providence a∣bove, in guiding Admirall <HI>Van-Trompe</HI> here below, <HI>England</HI> doubtlesse in the said yeer 1639 had miserably felt the savage crueltie of <HI>Spaines</HI> great Treacherie; to a Kingdom then and still in League and friendship with him. Heretofore the coura∣gious stoutnesse of the <HI>English</HI> had rather expire in a valiant re∣sistance, than yeeld to the lasting slavery of so proud a Nation.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of ever famous memorie, kept them under enough; and their <HI>Spanish</HI> proud hearts humble in sight onely of her Majesties ships, and her Vice-Admirall Sir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> as for instance, when the Armado of <HI>Spaine</HI> in the yeer 1588. was arrived in the Narrow Seas, having passed the place of their ex∣pected supply, and gotten Sea-roome for their high bodied Hulks, spread their main sails, and made away as fast as winde and water would give them leave, more fearing the small Fleet and Forces of the <HI>English,</HI> (though nothing in number like unto them) than standing upon termes of Honour either of their chieftains or Invicible Navy: Yet surely if they had known the want of Powder, (a fault unexcusable upon our coasts) they (no doubt) would have stood longer to their tacklings. But God in this of 1588. as likewise of the last Armado of <HI>Spaine,</HI> 1639. would have us to acknowledge, that we were onely delivered by his own gracious providence and arme, and not by any po∣licie or strength of our own. A Motto on the said Vice-Admi∣rall
<PB N="6" REF="4"/><HI>Drake,</HI> though not much pertinent to the matter in the pre∣cedencie of these observations treated on, yet deservedly to be remembred to the everlasting renown of so valiant and so true a Subject to the said Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI>
<Q><L>If Popery should (which God forbid) re-raigne,</L>
<L>They could not, Noble <HI>Drake,</HI> dig up thy grave,</L>
<L>As once they did, I say, with fell disdain,</L>
<L>Against good <HI>Luther</HI> furiously rage and rave.</L>
<L>They could not doe't 'gainst thee, I say, for why,</L>
<L>Thy bones in th'bottome of the sea do lie.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now to the Subject aforesaid, notwithstanding the weak∣nesse of the said Fortifications, in that time of streight 1639. <HI>Englands</HI> Sea provision was as weak, if not weaker than the Ca∣stles, Fortifications, &amp;c. Provision on the shore, onely foure of his Majesties ships (neer those Sea rowns and Villages afore∣named then and still in distresse, if no better fortified then with∣in these few moneths now past, if any occasion or attempt in a warlike manner be offered) for assistance and preservation of <HI>Brittaines</HI> great Island; What were his Highnesse said 4. ships of warre to the <HI>Spanish</HI> great Gallownes fiftie three in number? full of provision of all materials for warre, fitted with grave and (questionlesse) skilfull Sea-men. Moreover in each said ship or great Gallowne, were a very great store of Land-men: Like∣wise to each severall great companies were Captains both of sea and land souldiers, in those vast Gallownes.</P>
<P>The report of a friend of mine, skilfull both in Sea and Land Imployments, declared his opinion, That this mighty Fleet was bound either for <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> and, said he, a fit time for them to act their afore-intended Designes; By reason <HI>England</HI> hath enough to do with <HI>Scotland</HI> at present: yet (said he) though their pretence be for the relief of <HI>Flanders</HI> chief City and Sea-town <HI>Dunkerke,</HI> there to discharge their multitudes of Sea and Land Souldiers, said he, the Hulls or Bottoms of those mighty warlike Gallownes draw too much water for ever coming to <HI>Dunkerke,</HI> or any nearer than a League or two: therefore (said he) if their Commissions were made known, this Fleet is to land in some Port or Ports of <HI>England,</HI> for they have both Sea and
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>Land Companies, and likewise their Ordnance are mounted with Land carriages above the Decks of their Gallownes; To the intent immediatly after their landing in their Ports designed by their Commissions, that with the Field or Land carriages wherewith the said Ordnance are mounted, may display upon the Countrey; And likewise with mans strength, or otherwise, draw them against the Castles, Bulwarks, and fortified Places of this Island, thereby forthwith to obtain a great part of the Shire or Countie wherein they land, untill repulse, nay even to the City of <HI>London,</HI> the Metropolitane City of this Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> Many great Papists (of this Kingdom (for instance) during the Spanish Fleets stay in the Downs, a good Road for ships neer <HI>Dover</HI>) came thither, and were very jocant and jovi∣all, nay some of them in a kind of commanding way, seeing things almost compliant with their purposes.</P>
<P>And at the time aforesaid generally through the whole King∣dom, every Province or County had a Treasurer for the Pa∣Pists, to supply the wants either of weapons or money of all the Popish party that needed therein; so that consequently the said <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet came for and was provided for this Kingdom in that time of <HI>Englands</HI> distresse. I say distresse, by reason of the intended warre betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which (God be praised) hath ended in a blessed peace, and likewise the weak∣nesse of <HI>Englands</HI> Navie and Fortifications aforesaid. Now not omitting a true verse, describing this Kingdoms publique wel∣fare, (if truly observed) for the knowledge of <HI>Englands</HI> Wor∣thies in the Honorable and high Court of <HI>Parliament,</HI> now as∣sembled as followeth.
<Q><L>England's safe gates, are her Cirqueports,</L>
<L>Her stately ships, her walls:</L>
<L>Her Camps, the Sea; Bulwarks, her Corps;</L>
<L>Her heart, her Generals.</L></Q></P>
<P>The dayes are now dangerous, and full of mischiefs infinite, therefore if the great Councell of Parliament would but cast their eyes (on the Kings Navie, Castles, Towers, Bulwarks, Blockhouses, and all fortified places for <HI>Englands</HI> safetie and de∣fence,
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>and likewise upon a book entituled, The Advice of that worthie Commander Sir <HI>Charles Howard,</HI> newly published, and lately presented to this most Noble and Honorable Assemblie of Parliament; together with another small book entituled, M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Balls</HI> Propositions of Fortifications) and have them fully and exactly viewed, and certified under the hands of the severall Generals, Admirals, Captains, Lieutenants, Gunners, and Offi∣cers, both of Navie and Fortifications, as they will testifie upon their oaths on the holy Evangelists before this great Court of Parliament; That the Worthies thereof may know, the true state of the strength of the Kingdom, and so trienually in Par∣liament continually make restitution and provision for the same: For as a learned Member in this Parliament once spake, That <HI>England's</HI> safetie consists in being provided continually for warre, and to assist the Allies of the Protestant partie; the maintenance of the said warlike provision may continually be preserved and supplied by a blessed and happy peace.</P>
<P>That likewise persons of good trust, and well affected to the Protestant Religion, may continually be imployed in all the Kings ships, Castles, Towers, Bulwarks, Block-houses, and all other fortified places of this Kingdom; so that <HI>England</HI> may hereafter be as formidable as ever to the terror of her Enemies, and the safetie of her Inhabitants, and the advancement of the true Protestant Religion; the which questionlesse will give great satisfaction to all good Protestants, Gods children, and the Kings most loyall and obedient subjects.</P>
<P>Now let us all conclude, that your Indeavours may (by Gods most gracious assistance) be for our Countreys and Kingdom flourishing in true Religion, and repulse to all our Enemies do∣mestick and forraigne, both of Church and State, holding this Maxime for ever:</P>
