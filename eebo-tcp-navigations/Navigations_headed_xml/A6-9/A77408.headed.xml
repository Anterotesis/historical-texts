<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Turkish</HI> War upon the <HI>Empire,</HI> being at present the Great Action of <HI>Chri∣stendom;</HI> and that where∣upon all Mens Eyes, and thoughts are fix'd, who have any Consideration, even for <HI>Christi∣anity</HI> it self: It will perchance be a work not unacceptable, to give the World a brief Relation of the <HI>Rise,</HI> and <HI>Progress</HI> of the Quarrel; which is the Business of this lit∣tle Treatise, being a <HI>Narrative</HI> of the most Remarkable Passages of the last <HI>Campag∣nia,</HI> Written in <HI>High Dutch</HI> by an Indu∣strious, and Carefull Hand, and turned into <HI>English,</HI> for the Satisfaction of the <HI>English Reader.</HI> There is likewise Order taken for a Continuation of the Story, which shall come forth in its due time, be∣ing Committed to the Care of diverse In∣telligent Persons, where the <HI>Scene</HI> lyes, to gather the <HI>Materials</HI> for it; to the End, that nothing Worthy of Observation
<PB REF="3"/>may be omitted. As to the Narrative in Hand; (to give the Reader a clearer Prospect of the Matter;) We shall Ʋsher it in, with an Accompt Lately deliver'd to the <HI>States General</HI> by Count <HI>Zinzen∣dorf,</HI> (his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesties <HI>Envoyé</HI> at the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue</HI>) concerning the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the War, and so proceed.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The <HI>Reasons,</HI> whereupon was grounded the Proposal from his Sacred <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, to their Honorable Lordships the <HI>States General,</HI> which they may be plea∣sed to Weigh, and Consider.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> THat His Sacred Majesty gave no Cause for this War; but that Perpetual, and Irreconcilable Enemy to <HI>Christianity,</HI> provoked by no Injurie; without any Colour, or Pretence of Justice, or Honesty; In the Year <HI>1660.</HI> Seized upon <HI>Waradine,</HI> a strong Castle on the very Borders of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which he Garrison'd with a great party to infest the Neighbou∣ring <HI>Provinces.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="3"/><HI>2.</HI> Ʋpon which account, his Sacred <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, was not onely forc'd to Raise a suddain Army <HI>Himself,</HI> to oppose so great an Enemy, but also to call for ayd from the other Princes and States of the <HI>Empire;</HI> as likewise to look out to other <HI>Christian Kings</HI> and <HI>States,</HI> unlesse he would have exposed the whole Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> to present danger, and let those Royal Provinces of <HI>Transylvania, Wil∣lachia,</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> be rent off from <HI>Christendom,</HI> and Enslav'd to the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Empire.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> When the Enemy gave some hopes of a Friendly Composing the Busines, his Sa∣cred <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty was defective in nothing which upon hon st Conditions might conduce to Peace.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> When the last Year a Treaty was be∣gun between his Majesties Ambassad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, and <HI>Ati Bassa,</HI> Plenipotentiary from the <HI>Turk,</HI> which afterwards was by Common Consent perfected, and in Expectation of a Ratification, then began other more weigh∣ty Conditions to be required, and harder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erms, with a great deal of Perfidiousness, were almost imposed upon us: And at last
<PB REF="4"/>having gathered a great Number of Forces together, both out of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> vio∣lating the Faith and Religion of all former <HI>Treaties,</HI> he brake into <HI>Hungary</HI> at the same Instant, both Proclaiming, and Wa∣ging War; (His Majesties <HI>Embassadour,</HI> contrary to the Law of Nations, detain'd by force,) was proudly, and contumeliously used.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> 'Tis clear, this fraudulent Enemy hath taken his opportunity in a time, when his Majesties <HI>Hereditary</HI> Dominions have been exhausted by continual Wars, and other Causes; as likewise almost all other <HI>Chri∣stian Princes</HI> weakned, by Civil Discords amongst themselves.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> Notwithstanding which, his Sacred <HI>Impeiral</HI> Majesty, and his Dominions have omitted nothing, whereby they might sustain the burthen of so great a War, by their own strength, and hinder the progress of the Enemy until the Assistance from the Princes of the <HI>Empire</HI> could be ready.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> Which neither coming in time, nor with so considerable a Force as was necessa∣rily requir'd, the storms spread further: <HI>Newhausel,</HI> and other Cities of less Note
<PB REF="4"/>were subdued by the <HI>Turks; Moravia</HI> laid wast by the Incursions of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> many Thousand <HI>Christians</HI> carried away to perpetual Captivity, The Faith and Con∣stancy of <HI>Transylvania</HI> wavered; and which is most considerable, the Ambitious Enemy took courage from his Success; So that now he doth not onely promise himself the Kingdome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> but likewise publickly boasts, that he will suddainly be Head of the <HI>Western Empire.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><HI>8.</HI> To which purpose, as we are inform'd from good hands, he intends to be in the Field the next Spring, and with a greater Force then formerly, set upon his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, and the <HI>Christian Empire,</HI> re∣solving to carry away with him all that he meeteth with from fourteen Years of Age to Sixty</P>
<P N="9"><HI>9.</HI> 'I is true indeed, the danger of this War doth more immediatly hang over his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, and his Dominions, but then it is not less a truth, that all other <HI>Christian Princes,</HI> both in General and Particular are concern'd.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>10.</HI> Not onely because all professing <HI>Christianity</HI> are by that Bond united into
<PB REF="5"/>one Body, espeicall against him who equally detests all, taking his first Rise from the Ruines of <HI>Christian</HI> Kingdoms; particu∣larly the <HI>Eastern Empire</HI> it self, and now desires nothing more then by propagating the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Superstition, to extin∣guish <HI>Christian</HI> Religion</P>
<P N="11"><HI>11.</HI> But in another respect it is clear, that the Event of this War doth concern All, and every One, although they regard nothing but their own security</P>
<P N="12"><HI>12.</HI> For seeing it is manifest, the King∣dome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and other his Majesties Dominions have been for a long time the sole Bulwark of <HI>Christendom;</HI> and no lesse manifest that, That being broke through, the rest lies open to an Infinite Rab∣ble of <HI>Barbarians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Germany</HI> being in the midst of <HI>Europe,</HI> and joyning upon most <HI>Christian</HI> Kingdoms; the Consequence muct needs be this; His Sacred Majesty, and the strength of the <HI>Empire</HI> being once over-thrown, (which God forbid) that Cruel Enemy will lye heavy upon them all, and be equally formidable to every one of them.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>13.</HI> Neither is he only so for number of
<PB REF="5"/>Souldiers, (which all <HI>Christian</HI> Princes should they Muster their Forces together, would scare equall) but likewise for Mili∣tary Discipline; for in so numerous an Army there is none, that drink Wine; are delicate in the Dyet, or in any other un∣necessaries: none that maintain <HI>Char∣riots Feuds, Women,</HI> or any such like Impediments of War: So that the <HI>Turks</HI> can with less charge maintain <HI>Three Hun∣dred Thousand</HI> in Armes, then any <HI>Christian</HI> Prince <HI>Fifty Thousand.</HI></P>
<P N="14"><HI>14.</HI> Moreover, he hath this Advantage, he never regardeth the losse of his Men; the Effusion of whose blood he careth not for, so he may gain his design upon those he Warreth against; Subduing Town, and Country: the Common Souldiers them∣selves, out of a strange Superstitious per∣swasion, voluntarily devoting their Lives to his Service, whilst all <HI>Christian</HI> Princes are in another Condition, there being no Victory so great, but may be purchased too dear by <HI>Christian</HI> Blood.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>15.</HI> To these, we may add, that at this time (to the great disgrace of <HI>Christen∣dome</HI>) the <HI>Turk</HI> hath verynigh a perfect
<PB REF="6"/>Army of <HI>Christian Rebells,</HI> and <HI>Rene∣gadoes;</HI> who being formerly brought up in Warrs amongst <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, by en∣gaging themselves to the <HI>Turk,</HI> teach them the readiest way of Pitching Battles, Be∣sieging Towns, and ordering their Camp, heretofore not know by them.</P>
<P N="16"><HI>16.</HI> In the Common cause this is the sole difference; his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty cannot venture without some considerable danger, <HI>every wound given</HI> him (as the Proverb is) <HI>goes to the heart;</HI> but other Princes may engage without any Considerable da∣mage, in respect of their power and strength, so that they shall not partake of his Maje∣sties danger, but gain to themselves Eternal praise and honour.</P>
<P N="17"><HI>17. Six Hundred Years</HI> agoe, and diverse times since, the <HI>Christian</HI> Princes undertook a <HI>Forreign</HI> Expedition against the <HI>Turk;</HI> onely out of a design to propagate the <HI>Christian Cause;</HI> and the Common people Emulating their piety, Contributed thereunto voluntarily upon their own account.</P>
<P N="18"><HI>18.</HI> Neither is it probable any <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Princes have so far degenerated from
<PB REF="6"/>the piety of their Ancestors, as not to assist the same Cause, which is now more necessary, because to repell, not wage a War; so that that confederacy cannot but be most accep∣table to God, wherein all <HI>Christian</HI> Princes unanimously agree to maintain the Common Cause of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hristendom.</HI></P>
<P N="19"><HI>19.</HI> The Report of this Confederacy (for Fame makes all things sound at the best) may not alittle Contribute towards the War, or at least-wayes take from the Ene∣my that hope, which he hath hitherto pro∣mis'd himself from the discords of <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Princes, by which means he will not be so far Conceited, but dread that Power when united, which he Contemned, whilst divided into Factions.</P>
<P N="20"><HI>20.</HI> However things happen, his Sacred Majesty, under the protection of Divine Providence is resolv'd to venture, and Sa∣crifice, both to his own, and Peoples For∣tunes in defence of Himself, and the Pub∣lick good.</P>
<P N="21"><HI>21.</HI> But least he should seem defective in that which was his Duty, (it being a satis∣faction in misfortune to have omitted no∣thing, that might prevent it) he thought fit
<PB REF="7"/>to send some of his Chief Nobility to most Princes in <HI>Christendom,</HI> that as well by his Entreaty, as Example, they might par∣ticipate of so Glorious and Enterprize.</P>
<P N="22"><HI>22.</HI> Which thing having once purpos'd, He immediately thought upon their Ho∣nourable Lordships the <HI>States General,</HI> not doubting, but that their Prudence, and Acquaintance with such Affairs will give an answer that may be an Example to other Princes, and let them understand that a Common danger, is to be Engaged against by a Common Charge and Councell, hoping they will give such Assistance as shall be agreeable to the greatness of the danger, the Dignity which they bear amongst other <HI>Christian States;</HI> the Publick and Pri∣vate Wealth of those <HI>Provinces</HI> they com∣mand and that Glory which hath accru'd to them both in Peace, and War; and lastly to the True, and sincere Friendship which hath alwayes been between them, and the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI></P>
<P N="23"><HI>23.</HI> Especially when they well know there seldome occurrs Matter for so much Virtue and Praise, and therefore his Ma∣jesty doth easily assure himself that upon
<PB REF="7"/>their own accord they would engage inso Holy a War, and not suffer the <HI>Christian Cause</HI> to be Over-thrown, or stand still whilst others reap the Glory.</P>
<P N="24"><HI>24.</HI> One thing more must be observ'd, that the Greatest Concern in the Affaire, Consists in the Expedition, which as it Commends all Courtesies; so it is absolutely necessary to this that his Majesty may have sufficient time to anticipate the Councel of his Enemies.</P>
<P N="25"><HI>25.</HI> But above all things, this must be taken notice of <HI>(viz.)</HI> how much it concerns all men that will bear part in so Pious a work, that this Year, or as soon as can be, the War be undertaken, that so the Enemy being frustrated of his design of overcoming <HI>Hungary,</HI> and Subverting the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> may be willing to Embrace an ho∣nest Peace, which is a happiness his Majesty cannot promise himself, unless assisted from other <HI>Christian Princes;</HI> all being little enough, either to obtain the Victory, or con∣tinue the War.</P>
<P N="26"><HI>26.</HI> But the War being prolonged for some Years, the whole Strength of the <HI>Em∣pire</HI> will be consum'd, and by Consequence
<PB REF="8"/>a greater necessity of requiring <HI>Forreign</HI> Ayd, which in so miserable a Condition cannot be denyed, by those that regard their own security; so that we may say, how much the less <HI>Christian Princes</HI> contribute this Summer to the War; so much the more will they be fore't to give for the Future, neither then will it conduce so much to their praise, because requisite to their preservation.</P>
<P N="27"><HI>27.</HI> This is all his Majesty thought fit to Enform their Lordships of, though he might have added much more, but chose rather to omit it, least he should seem to doubt their Lordships willingness to Embrace so Noble a <HI>Specimen</HI> of a pious and generous a spirit, as it must needs be to ayd a distress'd Friend.</P>
<P N="28"><HI>28.</HI> As for the form and mannerof send∣ing the Assistance, it is very reasonable the whole Business should be left to the prudence and discretion of their Lordships; unless it may be thought expedient, that their Lord∣ships Commissioners, together with the un∣derwritten <HI>Envoyé Extra;</HI> from his <HI>Im∣perial Majesty</HI> should Examine, by what meanes the Business may be best perform'd, for the Publick Good, and least to their loss and dammage.</P>
<P N="29"><PB REF="8"/><HI>29.</HI> And as the Conscience of so Noble a Fact, is a sufficient Reward to valiant Spirits; so his Majesty, and all the Princes of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> shall for ever keep in memory, the greatness of the favour, and do promise upon the Faith of <HI>Germany,</HI> if occasion sever, they shall be willing to repay, what ever Obligations your Lordships will lay upon them.</P>

<HEAD>A Brief Chronicle Of the Late TVRKISH WAR.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning the Grounds of the Late <HI>Turkish</HI> War, which by Many Men, both Learned, and Un∣learned, has been long since foretold, several Men are of several Opinions: Some impute it to the
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>Action of <HI>Ragotzi,</HI> in the Year, 1657. in <HI>Poland;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The grounds of the Tur∣kish War.</NOTE> being under∣taken without the Consent of the <HI>Grand Signior:</HI> Others, to other Causes; but the Most (with my self) look upon it as the heavy Judgment of Heaven drawn down upon us by our multiply'd Trans∣gressions. But it is not My Pur∣pose to deduce the Causes of the Warre, I shall only acquaint the Reader with some Remarquable Passages concerning the Proceed∣ings of This Barbarous Enemy a∣gainst <HI>Hungary,</HI> and other Coun∣tryes Bordring upon him. To recite the Actions of Prince <HI>Ra∣go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zi</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> I reckon needle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as being already Breviated in my <HI>Polonian Relations.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1657. <HI>George Ra∣gotzi,</HI> Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> fi∣nished his War in <HI>Poland;</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>with much ado, made his Retreat to his Principality; where he found, too late, the extream mi∣sery which he had brought upon himself. For so it was, that the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> making the worst Construction of all <HI>Ragotzi</HI>'s Act∣ings in <HI>Poland</HI> (which Kingdome was then in Amity with the <HI>Turk</HI>) resolved to punish This Underta∣king in his <HI>Vassal,</HI> as an Assront to the State of <HI>Turkey.</HI> Upon the Apprehension of which Conse∣quence, Prince <HI>Ragotzi</HI> put him∣self into a Posture of Defence, to the utmost of his Power. In 1658 he was yet at Quiet;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turk</HI> falls upon <HI>Ragotzi.</HI></NOTE> but in 1659 the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> pour'd in a Nu∣merous Army of <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Tartar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> into <HI>Transylvania;</HI> who practis'd all the Insolvencies and Outrages of Burning, Killing, Ravishing, (and the like) imaginable. This Horrid
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>Invasion of the <HI>Infidels</HI> was vali∣antly oppos'd by <HI>Ragotzi</HI>'s Forces, Skirmishing with them at severall times very successefully, and so long as He liv'd, his Forts were not Attempted. Soon after; the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> (no longer brooking this Audacity in his <HI>Vassal</HI>) dispatch'd an Embassadour to the <HI>Emperour</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> with Rich Presents; Desi∣ring his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty not to concern himself in Prince <HI>Ragot∣zi</HI>'s Affairs, the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperour being resolv'd to prosecute the said <HI>Rogatzi</HI> to the highest point of Ex∣tremity.</P>
<P>In 1660, the <HI>Turk</HI> lost no times; but sent a greater Power then be∣fore, into <HI>Transylvania.</HI> In the mean whise, Prince <HI>Ragotzi</HI> march∣ed with a Considerable Force be∣fore <HI>Hermanstad,</HI> and it come to a Bloody Encounter, wherein <HI>Ra∣gotzi</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>deported himself valiantly killing 17 men with his own hand;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turk</HI> worsted by <HI>Rogotzi.</HI></NOTE> and so the <HI>Infidels</HI> for That Bout were forced to quit the Field, and leave the Victory to the <HI>Transyl∣vanias,</HI> and 6 or 7000 <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> upon the place. <HI>Ragotzi</HI> in the Persuit received 5 wounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who dyes of his wounds.</NOTE> and 5 dayes after This Fight (<HI>June</HI> the <HI>6th</HI>) he was brought to <HI>Great-Waradin,</HI> where he departed this Life.</P>
<P>The fall of this Prince ballanc'd the Advantage of the Victory, and exceedingly Animated the <HI>Turks,</HI> who pressing more and more ea∣gerly upon the <HI>Transylvanians,</HI> drove them every where to their strong Holds: Whereupon Ge∣neral <HI>Souches</HI> by Order from <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> drew toward <HI>Transylvania,</HI> to make it good against the <HI>Turks;</HI> and forthwith march'd thither with a
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>considerable Body, and possess'd himself of several Holds.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 14 of the same year, the <HI>Turk</HI> with 100000 Men laid close Siege to <HI>Great-Waradin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great <HI>Wa∣radin</HI> Besic∣ged.</NOTE> which was stoutly defended by one <HI>Marcus Claudius,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> the Gover∣nour of the Town. During the Siege, the <HI>Turk</HI> sent abroad strong Parties to subdue smaller Towns, forcing the People unto severall works, as the building of Bridges, and the Like, putting them to the Sword at last for their Reward: At one time killing 150 <HI>Christians,</HI> and at another, Loading 20 Wagons with <HI>Christians</HI> Heads which they carried away.</P>
<P>On the 6 of <HI>August,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gover∣nour killed, and the Place yield∣ed up.</NOTE> that brave Souldier and Governour, <HI>Marcus Claudius</HI> was slain by a short, &amp; (the Besieged being left without any hope of Relief) This strong Place
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>was surrendred upon the <HI>Turk</HI> upon Accord; being a passage into <HI>Tran∣sylvania, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Ragotzi,</HI> there started up One <HI>Barkay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barkay</HI> U∣surps upon <HI>Transylva∣nia.</HI></NOTE> a Creature of the <HI>Turks,</HI> making himself Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> whom the <HI>Turk</HI> protected and supplyed with Forces, whereby he undertook to reduce several Places, siding in pretence with General <HI>Souches</HI> (who wel understood this violence of the <HI>Turks,</HI> to be a design not only upon <HI>Transylvania,</HI> but also upon the <HI>Empire</HI> it self) and ma∣king large Professions under hand, that whatsoever he got by the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Ayd, was meant for the good of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> to whom he said that he Intended a Just and an Ho∣nourable Restitution, reserving on∣ly <HI>Waradin</HI> to remain under the Power of the Prince of <HI>Transylva∣nia;</HI>

<P>Toward the Close of this Year, a <HI>Blazing Star</HI> appear'd with the Tayle toward <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and the <HI>Head</HI> toward <HI>Transylvanta,</HI> which prov'd but a forerunner of the en∣suing Calamityes.</P>
<P>Soon after This, the <HI>Labolizish</HI> Peasants Rebell'd against the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> in <HI>Transylvania,</HI> whom they partly put to the sword, some they took Prisoners, and others they sold to the <HI>Turk,</HI> The Right suc∣cessour of <HI>Ragotzi,</HI> was <HI>Kemini Ja∣nos,</HI> (by many <HI>Transylvanians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kemini Ja∣nos <HI>opposes</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar kay.</NOTE> re∣ceiv'd and entertain'd for such) who was bitterly persecuted by <HI>Barkay</HI> and the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1661 He fought them at <HI>Thassabat,</HI> and made a great slaughter: But at Last, oppressed with Numbers, he left <HI>Transylva∣nia,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>and retreated to <HI>Tokay.</HI> And now it appear'd that the <HI>Turks</HI> bu∣siness was not to stop there, but to fall also upon <HI>Hungary.</HI> Where∣upon his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty granted Commissions for the raising of an Army, which was dispatch'd, part of it into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and part into <HI>Transylvania.</HI> In the <HI>Interim;</HI> Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> began to look to himself, and rais'd a strong Fort on the Wall over against <HI>Canisia,</HI> Naming it <HI>Serinswar:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Build∣ing of <HI>Se∣rinswar.</HI></NOTE> getting to∣gether a strong Body of <HI>Croats,</HI> and other Nations, that lay heavy up∣on the Quarters there about: which the <HI>Turks</HI> stomach'd not a little, however they carried it fair at pre∣sent, and for a while they talk'd of nothing but Peace, but at last they brake out into high expressions, that they would have <HI>Serinswar</HI> de∣molish'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre∣tence of the Quarrel.</NOTE> Count <HI>Serini</HI> punish'd,
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>and <HI>Transylvania</HI> subjected to the Power of the <HI>Turk</HI> by way of Re∣paration. None of which follow∣ed; but the <HI>Christians</HI> lookt upon it as every mans Interest to do his Best to defend himself against the Ambition, and Outrages of This Common Enemy; and there being nothing now to be expected but a great <HI>Turkish</HI> War, which was al∣ready begun by Parties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> enter upon <HI>Turky.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> entred upon the Borders of <HI>Turky,</HI> drawing toward <HI>Stul-Weis∣senburg,</HI> and <HI>Offen:</HI> and they sub∣dued <HI>Zamock, Warda, Erzy,</HI> and <HI>Hirt:</HI> all these being inconsiderable Houses, and Castles, which with their Defenders were blown up, and fired.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the <HI>Turks</HI> gathered together a Mighty Army Consisting of <HI>Asicatick, African,</HI> and <HI>Europaean</HI> People;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Preparati∣ons.</NOTE> and from this
<PB N="11" REF="14"/><HI>Acheron</HI> issued those Devils in the shape of men, that have since tor∣mented <HI>Christendom.</HI> To this nu∣merous Army, they had likewise provided an incredible proportion of Victuals, Ammunition, and Ar∣tillery. Nevertheless, several Trea∣ties were set a foot, which the <HI>Turk</HI> so long insisted upon, till he had gained his End, and drawn a for∣midable Power into the Field, to break in upon the <HI>Christians,</HI> who laboured as much as in them lay, to preserve the Peace; but who can live longer at Peace, then his Neighbour will give him leave?</P>
<P>The Army of the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> Consisted of 40000 <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Souldiers, who had the <HI>Turks</HI> for their <HI>Open,</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> for their <HI>Private</HI> Enemies (the ani∣mosity being so great, that many times it came to Blows betwixt the
<PB N="12" REF="15"/><HI>Germans</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians.</HI>) These many Inconveniences, part∣ly from the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who deny∣ed Victuals to the <HI>German</HI> Army, and partly from diseases arising from the disagreement of the Cli∣mate, were much weakned, and di∣minished. <HI>Hungary</HI> is questionless a very brave Country, and abounds in Wine, and certain Fruits, which taken to Excesse, breed dangerous Surfeits. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> in their deportment are generally Grave, and Modest, but being Affronted by the <HI>Germans,</HI> and others of a dif∣ferent Religion, they are prone to revenge, and hard to be Reconciled.</P>
<P>Toward the Month of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army was exceedingly pester'd with Surfeits, so that be∣twixt those that dyed, Many that lay sick, and others that were carri∣ed
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>out of the Country, it fell to a low Ebbe: and moreover, being then as far as <HI>Clausenburg,</HI> or there∣abouts, they were put to some di∣stress for Victuals and Forage: the Enemy encreasing daily more and more against them, (for in those Parts the <HI>Turkish</HI> Power was strongest) About this time, the Up∣start Prince <HI>Barkay</HI> fell into dis∣grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barkay</HI> in disgrace, <HI>Abafiv</HI> pre∣ferr'd.</NOTE> and the <HI>Turk</HI> preferred one <HI>Abafti</HI> to that dignity in his stead.

<PB N="14" REF="16"/>rounded on all sides, and striving to clear his passage, he seemed only carefull how he might fall with Honour: for his Army through ma∣ny Skirmishes, Diseases, and great Scarcity of Provision, was melted away, and hope of Succour there was none left; the <HI>German</HI> Army by the like Accidents being weak∣ned and put to a Retreat. Upon these Terms it was, that he com∣mitted himself to places of more security, and in <HI>Zathmar,</HI> He with Others, expected the Issue of the Treaty. But the <HI>Turks,</HI> (as has been said already) making use of a Trea∣ty only for their own Advantage, put themselves into a stronger Po∣sture: In the mean time dischar∣ging their Choler with great indig∣nation, one while against the Va∣liant <HI>Venetians</HI> (that have held them tack so long in <HI>Candia</HI>) by
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>and by against the divided <HI>Poloni∣ans;</HI> and now and then against the half-Conquered <HI>Transylvanians;</HI> but not a word all this while, nor so much as a look of displeasure a∣gainst <HI>Hungary.</HI> This <HI>Fox-play</HI> of the Treaty lafted till the Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Warre breaks out in 1663.</NOTE>1663, and then the-Fury of these <HI>Infidels</HI> brake out, not only upon <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and <HI>Hungaria;</HI> but upon the <HI>Emperours</HI> Hereditary Countries also; yea, and upon the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> it self.</P>
<P>This shall serve for an Introdu∣ction to the following <HI>Narrative.</HI> What further occurr'd betwixt these two Parties, is expos'd and publish'd at large, both at <HI>Franck∣fort,</HI> and elsewhere: so that I shall only take notice of such Passages as happen'd since <HI>July</HI> 1663. con∣cerning the <HI>Turks</HI> Proceedings in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and upon the Borders, and
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>what Opposition those <HI>Infidels</HI> have met with from the <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>UPon <HI>July</HI> the 17, 1663. the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> came in great Pomp and Magnificence to <HI>Offen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> comes with 100000 men to <HI>Of∣fen.</HI></NOTE> encamping himself in the <HI>Pesterfield,</HI> being 4. <HI>German</HI> miles in Compass. His Army was upward of a hun∣dred thousand men, above one hun∣dred great Guns, and of Wagons, &amp; Beasts, a number not to be belie∣ved. His first work was to lay two <HI>Ship-Bridges</HI> over the <HI>Danube;</HI> the one near to <HI>Gran</HI> and the other not far from <HI>Parkam.</HI> His Forces being quarter'd about those parts in Pro∣digious Multitudes, it was as yet doubtfull, whether he would fall upon <HI>Newhausel,</HI> or <HI>Raab;</HI> having his eye indifferently upon both, and lying still for a good while without Action. But this Blood-Thirsty
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>brute had shew'd himself much sooner, if a continual fall of Rain, and the Overflow of the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> had not hindred him: How∣ever at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> passe the River to∣ward <HI>New∣hausel.</HI></NOTE> he pass'd some thou∣sands of his Army over the Bridge near <HI>Parkam</HI> toward the side of <HI>Newhausel;</HI> when immediately a Report was spread by some of the Pesants that were turn'd to the <HI>Turk,</HI> that the River had torn their <HI>Ship-Bridges,</HI> and that those 4000 <HI>Turks</HI> that had passed over, were now Cut off from the Main-Body.</P>
<P>This Rumour it was, that in vei∣gled the Governour of <HI>Newhausel</HI> (Count <HI>Forgats</HI>) into a Couragious but an unhappy Refolution, which was, to fall upon those 4000 <HI>Turks,</HI> upon the supposition, that the Miscarriage of the Bridge had cut off their Retreat. It is very true, that he was earnestly dissuaded
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>from that Attempt, and told, that the Body was greater then he ima∣gined, but still persisting in his Re∣solve to fight them, upon the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> with his <HI>Hungarians, Hus∣sars</HI> and <HI>Heydukes,</HI> and 11 Troups of <HI>Germans,</HI> and 500 Musquetters (in all 6000 strong) he marched up to them, and finding the Enemy four times more then he expected, became sensible of the Abuse, al∣though alass! too late: for the <HI>In∣fidels</HI> having gotten certain Intelli∣gence of the <HI>Christians</HI> design, and of their coming, caused the Bridges presently to be Repayred, which they had purposely disordered, and marching over with a strong Power surrounded them. The <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and <HI>Hussars,</HI> that were appointed to stand, for a Reserve, seeing the Enemy come on so strong, betook themselves to flight;
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>but the <HI>Germans,</HI> and <HI>Heyducks</HI> that gave the Onset behaved themselves stoutly, and sold a Dear Victory to the <HI>Turks.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>gats</HI> def∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</NOTE> At last by Multitudes they were overcome, and those that could not get away, were mi∣serably Cut, and Mangled, <HI>Forgats,</HI> and some few others escaped to <HI>Newhausel.</HI> This Combat lasted 3 hours, and about 3000 of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and <HI>Heyducks</HI> were put to the Sword.</P>
<P>After this Victory, the <HI>Turks</HI> be∣ing therewith encouraged, and the <HI>Christians</HI> not a little dejected, the Enemy made ready to lay a formal Siege unto <HI>Newhausel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> lay Sie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Newhausel.</HI></NOTE> with what Success will be seen in this ensuing Relation.</P>

<HEAD>A Narrative of the Most Re∣marquable Occurrences at the Siege of <HI>Newhausel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> a Trou∣per of the <HI>Walterish</HI> Regi∣ment, who in an Encounter had been taken Prisoner hard by <HI>Par∣kam,</HI> came to <HI>Newhausel,</HI> and Affir∣med that the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> in his Presence, caused all the Prisoners to be put to the Sword, whereup∣on 40 of the Turkish Prisoners in <HI>Newhausel</HI> were behead in re∣quital.</P>
<P>On the <HI>16th.</HI> dito, the Enemy some Guns into the <HI>Turks</HI> Campe,
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>that did Execution among them. Toward the Evening, the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> summon'd the Town, giving them three dayes to consider of a Surrender; but being Answered Negatively, the Enemy began to play upon the Fort.</P>
<P>On the <HI>18th.</HI> the Turk, with a great Shout, and a Peal of Cannon, Approach'd the <HI>Vienna Gate</HI> Posted themselves there, and presently fell to digging, Notwithstanding the continual shot made upon them; and over against <HI>Forgats</HI> Bulwork, they raised a Battery from beneath.</P>
<P>On the <HI>19th.</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> play'd their great Guns, and continued till the 23, making every day at least 350. great Shot against the Wall, the Balls weighing 65, 48, 35, and 22. pound.</P>
<P>On the <HI>21th.</HI> the Besieged made a Sally, putting some of the <HI>Turks</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>to the Sword, and took one Ensign from them, whereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Post at the <HI>Vienna-Gate,</HI> possess'd themselves of a <HI>Roundel,</HI> in which Action, many were slain on both sides.</P>
<P>On the <HI>25th.</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> began to Batter the <HI>Vienna-Gate.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>27th.</HI> there came one <HI>Turk</HI> into the Mote, who was taken Prisoner, and confess'd that he was sent to Scout, for which he was immediately knock'd on the head.</P>
<P>On the <HI>29th.</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Horse retired from the Fort, and drew near unto the <HI>Island Schutt,</HI> at which time they fir'd twelve Guns.</P>
<P>On the <HI>31th.</HI> the Enemy At∣tempted the <HI>Pallisado</HI>'s, and began also to fill up the Mote; and on this day, Lievetenant Colonel <HI>Mortinisa Lamberg</HI> received a Shot, of which he dyed the day follow∣ing.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
<P><HI>September</HI> the First, at night the Besieged, vowed to stand to it with their Officers to the last drop of their Blood.</P>
<P>On the <HI>2d dito,</HI> a great Number of <HI>Janisaries</HI> came into the Mote, against whom many shot were made, at which time it was suppo∣sed that the Enemy would give an Assault.</P>
<P>On the <HI>3d,</HI> two Corporals were condemned to dye for deserting their Post.</P>
<P>On the <HI>5th</HI> 140 Auxiliaries came in from <HI>Comorra,</HI> and Lievetenant Colonel <HI>Hagen,</HI> was touched light∣ly with a ball of two pound eight, and upon the same day the <HI>Turks</HI> forced out of the Ground some of the Pallisado's hard by the Fort, at which work, many of them were slain.</P>
<P>On the <HI>6th,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> Approach∣ed
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>in digging, to the middle of the <HI>Town-Mote.</HI></P>
<P>On the 7th it rained, so that they could not work.</P>
<P>On the 9th, Nine of the Defen∣dents were killed by shot, and our of the <HI>Turks</HI> were slain by one <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P>On the 10th, and Officer was Con∣demned to dye for leaving his Post, and giving way to the Enemy.</P>
<P>On the 11th, the <HI>Turks</HI> brake down the <HI>Vienna. Gate</HI> Bridge, which was repaired, and drawn up the next night; Many shot were this day made, and great Execu∣tion done upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>On the 13th they played strong∣ly with their great Guns, both up∣on the Wall, and into the City, but without much Harm.</P>
<P>On the 15th the <HI>Turks</HI> made a shot just into the mouth of a great
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>Gun in <HI>Newhausel,</HI> which made the Gun fly, and killed one man hard by it. In the Afternoon, 5 of the <HI>Turks</HI> that intended to passe the Mote, gave an Alarme, at which time the Lievetenant Colonel of the <HI>Walterish</HI> Regiment was killed with a Shot.</P>
<P>On the 17th, the Marquis of <HI>Grana</HI> was hurt with a Bullet be∣low the knee; but the Grand <HI>Cap∣tain</HI> was wounded in the Head, whereof he dyed; also between eleven and twelve of the Clock, the Enemy made an Assault in two places, which lasted till two, with great losse on both sides. At the Evening, the Besieged flung light∣ed <HI>Pitch-Barrels</HI> among the Enemy, which drove them out of <HI>Frederick Sconce;</HI> but at the going out of the Lights, the <HI>Turks</HI> pressed in again with two foot Companyes.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
<P>On the 18th, the <HI>Turks</HI> were working of a Mine, but the Besie∣ged in their Counter-mining drove them back; However by this means, they made a Breach in the wall sufficient for a Passage; at which time, the Besieged stood but one pace from the Enemy, whom they forc'd to retreat with kindled Pitch-Barrells.</P>
<P>On the 20th, the <HI>Turks</HI> climb'd over the <HI>Pallisado</HI>'s and began to undermine <HI>Forgats-Sconce:</HI> and about four in the after-noon they Attaqued <HI>Frederick-Scone,</HI> and planted seventeen of their En∣signes upon it; but were beaten off successfully, they likewise made an Assault upon <HI>Forgats-Sconce</HI> to their great losse.</P>
<P>On the 21th, they came on by night in great silence, and made another Assault; at which time an
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>Eminent <HI>Bassa</HI> was slain, and two Captains of the Besieged; and on both sides many Souldiers lost.</P>
<P>On the 22th, they made an∣other furious assault, but they were repulsed with losse, and kept off with flinging of kindled <HI>Pitch-Barrels</HI> among them: yet they came on again, but to no purpose. At this Bout, the Besieged lost a∣bove forty men, amongst whom were two Lievetenant Colonells, on whereof was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the other was <HI>Hagen:</HI> On this day, Marquis <HI>Pio</HI> was wounded in his Head with an Arrow, and in his Neck he received another wound, Marquis <HI>de Grana</HI> was wounded also on the Head.</P>
<P>On the 23th, the Enemy Batter∣ed 2o furiously, that <HI>Frederick,</HI> and <HI>Serin-Sconces</HI> were beaten to the Ground, and a Breach made Large
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>enough for three Horse-men to have passed a Brest. This whole night they shot, without Intermis∣sion, and with Incredible Labour and Delving, they raised a Mount of Earth so high, that from thence, they could Command the Town, and beat the Besieged from the Walls.</P>
<P>Wherejpon the <HI>Hungarians</HI> whispered one another, to <HI>Surren∣der,</HI> (out of a fear to dispute it any longer) which moved the <HI>Germans</HI> likewise to speak of an <HI>Accord,</HI> to <HI>Marquis Pio,</HI> who telling them that the Enemy kept no <HI>Accord;</HI> one of the Souldiers replyed, that <HI>he did;</HI> and thereupon, the <HI>Marquis</HI> ran him through, and kill'd him: How∣ever, presently after, they sent to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> demanding Ho∣norable Conditions, whose An∣swer was, that they should set
<PB N="29" REF="23"/>down their own Terms, leaving only their <HI>Creat Guns</HI> in the <HI>Fort.</HI></P>
<P>On the 25th, the <HI>Turks</HI> were ad∣mitted to the <HI>Gran-Gate.</HI></P>
<P>On the 26th, they stay'd there till twelve at Noon, and then the <HI>Christians</HI> marched out, with 2422 sound, and Armed men, many sick <HI>Germans,</HI> four Piece of Ordnance with Baggage, for which the <HI>Turks</HI> allowed Horses, and Waggons, and Conducted the Garrison to <HI>Comorra.</HI> The <HI>Tartars,</HI> and some of the <HI>Turks</HI> fell to plundering of several Houses in <HI>Newhausel,</HI> and some of the Waggons of those that marched out; but a <HI>Bassa</HI> staid their hands, and kept them in or∣der by force. At this Surrender, the Enemy got seventy piece of Ordnance; great store of Armes, Powder, Wine, Meal, and Corn; Many of the <HI>Hungarians</HI> tarrying in <HI>Newhausel</HI> with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

<P>At <HI>Auspitz</HI> there came Gallop∣ping six Troupers, habited after the <HI>German</HI> Fashion; and in bro∣ken Language, called for a Dinner in an Inn, and Provender for their Horses, telling the People they would pay for it.

<P>These Successes Encouraged the Enemy to draw nearer to the <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> and to Endeavour the making of their <HI>Winter-Quar∣ter</HI> thereabouts, and in <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary.</HI> A Rumour was then dispersed, that the <HI>Great Vizier</HI> had Commanded the Magistrates of <HI>Frystadt,</HI> and the Neighbou∣ring Parts, upon pain of Death to make a <HI>Ship-Bridge</HI> over the <HI>VVaegh</HI> with all speed, and to provide Victuals and Fodder to entertain him at his comming back. Thus did new Cares and Troubles come on, in a Season, when every man flatter'd himself with some hopes of Respit and Re∣pose.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Serini,</HI> that till now, staid in the Isle of <HI>Schutt,</HI> put him∣self Instantly into Motion, and now and then, met with some
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>Parties, and took good Booty from them; But alass! This would not serve to set the Ballance even. Upon <HI>November</HI> 12. He took, in a Moorish Place, betwixt <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Comorra,</HI> ten Camels, and as many Mules, laden with Truncks full of Gold and Silver-Plate; to∣gether with the Conductours, who were bound for <HI>Constantinople</HI> with this Booty.</P>
<P>In <HI>Comorra</HI> (where the Officers were at that time under Que∣stion, and came off well, about the Surrender of <HI>Newhausel</HI>) there were great Complaints of Scar∣city of Provision; the Country being so miserably wasted round about it. Whereupon, at <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> it was taken into thought, how those out-lying Garrisons might be supplyed, and the Ene∣my disappointed of their Ayme,
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>who knew full well the State of their Necessities. It is certain, that the <HI>Auxiliaries,</HI> and other Forces that were Quarter'd in <HI>Co∣morra,</HI> would much rather have kept the Field, if all other Cir∣cumstances would have permitted it; but those <HI>Auxiliaries,</HI> who by too liberall Feeding on the <HI>Au∣strian</HI> and <HI>Moravian</HI> Fruits, had Contracted Diseases, neither could, nor would stir; beside that their General, Count <HI>Hohenlo,</HI> a Pru∣dent, Expert, and Judicious Com∣mander, gave many weighty Rea∣sons against it. No sooner had this Lord made an Acquaintance in <HI>Vienna;</HI> But ill Fortune met with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Ho∣henlo</HI>'s Chamber Robb'd.</NOTE> his Chamber being Robb'd of Writings, Moneyes, and Jewels, to the value of betwixt twenty and thirty thousands <HI>Rix Dollars.</HI></P>
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>
<P>The <HI>Swedish Auxiliaries</HI> were not yet come up; but by Advice from <HI>Leipsick,</HI> they were then upon their March, not far from <HI>Thuringen,</HI> (about the midst of <HI>November</HI>) and 150. horse were likewise to come from <HI>Pomera∣nia,</HI> which Forces became the Ground of great Mistakes hap∣pening to be in Motion just upon that Nick of time, when the <HI>Er∣fordians</HI> (being then Outlawed) were in expectation of the <HI>Ment∣zish</HI> Troups: Upon whom they Issued forth, and in their Re∣turn left two Carpenters behind them, whom they hanged upon a Waggon, which did much en∣flame the tumult: but the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> Troups, which had so much troubled the heads of divers Peo∣ple, proved to be a Force of a∣nother design, and quality.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>
<P>The Rumour of the Return of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, (now so late in <HI>November</HI>) encreased more and more; at which time <HI>Filleck</HI> (some ten Mile from <HI>Cassaw</HI>) was given for lost; So that cer∣tain Regiments were immediate∣ly sent to make good the other <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> which the Enemy had particularly in their Eye for a <HI>Winter-Quarter.</HI> Those <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> which about this time ran∣som'd themselves from the <HI>Turks,</HI> speak much of the Stupendious Preparations, which are now in hand against <HI>Christendome;</HI> Af∣firming it for a certainty, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is resolv'd to take the Field next Spring, with an Army of three hundred thousand Men, which causes great perplex∣ities in <HI>Poland, Hungary, Mora∣via, Silesia,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> but
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>the <HI>Polanders,</HI> being at peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> conceived them∣selves in some measure secured by virtue of that Agreement; but in the <HI>Tartars, Moldavians,</HI> and <HI>Wallachians,</HI> they have not much confidence: Especially, when they are upon their Excur∣sions. Many were of opinion, that the <HI>Turks</HI> were forc'd upon an irregular and precipitate Re∣treat for want of Provisions, and that their attempts so late in the year, upon <HI>Moravia,</HI> and the neighbouring <HI>Provinces,</HI> were caused partly by the Inviting plen∣ty of all necessaries, which those Countries afford; and in part, by the encouragement they received from their correspondents in those Quarters; beside the scarcitie, which their longer continuance, upon the <HI>Danube</HI> would infalli∣bly
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>have produced thereabouts, to the great inconvenience of their Armies next Spring.</P>
<P><HI>Hungary</HI> lay now groaning un∣der the burden of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Power, and longing for aid; the <HI>Infidels</HI> over-spreading it like a dismal Cloud, charged with Hail and Thunder: all mens thoughts being sollicitous for deliverance, and in continual expectation where the storm would fall. Many were of opinion, that submission was the best expedient in this ex∣tremity; but betwixt the sense of their <HI>Allegiance</HI> sworn to the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and the distrust they had of the <HI>Turks</HI> Justice to his word, divers held off.</P>
<P>The Enemy (who did nothing rashly, though as is generally sup∣posed, rather acting by <HI>Instigati∣on</HI> then <HI>choice</HI>) counted it most
<PB N="69" REF="43"/><HI>adviseable</HI> to draw toward <HI>Cassaw</HI> the head City of <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary;</HI> knowing full well that when ever the <HI>Christians</HI> should <HI>Ʋnite,</HI> they would make this place the Seat of War, and Settle themselves there: Wherefore the <HI>Infidels</HI> went roundly to work, removing whatsoever might hinder their Progresse, before any succor could come up to them, which succour would however at last signifie not much against so Potent an Enemy.</P>
<P>About this time, the <HI>Polanders</HI> were a little Frighted with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who though returning homeward with their booty al∣ready gotten, might yet be temp∣ted by their greediness after more to break into the <HI>Cracovian Way∣wood-ship;</HI> and from thence, to advance into <HI>Silesia,</HI> according to
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>the old saying, <HI>Si Turca veniet in Germaniam, Ibit per Poloniam.</HI> If the <HI>Turk</HI> comes into <HI>Germany,</HI> he shall passe through <HI>Poland.</HI> These Incarnat and Rapacious Devils, however kept off yet, and carried their prey to their <HI>Caverns</HI> there to divide it. One thing is, that <HI>Cham,</HI> being the Head and Soveraign of these <HI>Tartars</HI> which had been in <HI>Moravia,</HI> was a friend to <HI>Poland,</HI> and about this time his Forces went in abundance with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> (in per∣son) and the Army, together with a great number of <HI>Cossacks,</HI> against the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> marching over the River <HI>Nieper,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Boristhenes.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> however went on in their proceeding, sub∣duing <HI>Shemniz, Cremniz,</HI> &amp; other <HI>Mine towns,</HI> &amp; sending threatning Letters to the Magistrates there∣about,
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>who being over-aw'd by the Terrour of Menaces, moved the People under them to do Ho∣mage to these <HI>Infidels.</HI> The ta∣king of the Fort <HI>Navigrad,</HI> (upon the strength whereof the People so much depended) did not a lit∣tle conduce to the Subjecting of the rest. And now they made their excursions towards <HI>Tokay,</HI> (where their noblest Wines grow) a strong Hold, Moted round a∣bout, and alwayes reputed as in∣vincible. Upon this place they practised both <HI>subtilty</HI> and <HI>force,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tokay</HI> at∣tempted.</NOTE> as they had <HI>done</HI> before <HI>Novigrad;</HI> but honest men had the keeping of it, and so they were forc'd to pass it by.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Turks</HI> caus∣ed the late subdued <HI>Lewents</HI> to be demolish'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lewents</HI> demoli∣shed.</NOTE> as not liking the manner of the Fortification, and
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>sent a threatning Order to those of <HI>Frystadt,</HI> to dispatch out of hand two Bridges over the <HI>Waegh</HI> larger then the former, and to make them broad enough for whole Squadrons to pass a Breast; And now they began to talk loud of another Invasion into <HI>Moravia;</HI> to which end, many thousands of the <HI>Tawny-Tartars</HI> throng'd into the Camp, as if those of the o∣ther complexion, had not yet play∣ed the Devils sufficiently in the Country; Whereupon to prevent that Inrode, a <HI>Counter-mand</HI> was sent to most of those forces, that were now march'd, or marching off to their <HI>Winter-Quarters;</HI> and Order given them to bend their Course toward the <HI>Waegh.</HI> Al∣though this Countenance of the <HI>Turks</HI> design gain'd not much Credit, in regard of the season
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>of the Year, it was however held for good discretion, not to be too secure.</P>
<P>Near the end of <HI>November,</HI> came to <HI>Vienna</HI> diverse of the ser∣vants of <HI>Baron de Goes,</HI> (who had been long employ'd as the <HI>Empe∣rours</HI> Agent toward the inten∣ded treaty for Peace) Affirming that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> with the <HI>Tartar Cham,</HI> have resolved, with an Incredible Force, to come per∣sonally into the Field next spring; and joyn the utmost of their pow∣er against <HI>Christendome.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the taking of which Re∣solution, vast Quantities of Rice and Corn were ordered at <HI>Adri∣anople,</HI> and <HI>Philippopoli</HI> to be car∣ried to <HI>Greek-Weissenberg,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Offen.</HI> This de∣termination and proceeding, en∣gaged the <HI>Christians</HI> to use their
<PB N="74" REF="46"/>utmost Endeavours possible, for the bringing of a considerable bo∣dy into the Field next Spring; and to this purpose, his <HI>Imperial</HI> Ma∣jesty having first given Audience to the Report of the said <HI>Baron,</HI> gives immediate Order for Pre∣parations; taking his Journy to the <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Regenspurg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Em∣perour</HI> goes to the <HI>Diet.</HI></NOTE> to stir up the Princes of the <HI>Empire</HI> to a General Conjunction against the <HI>Turk.</HI> In the <HI>Interim,</HI> the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles Joseph,</HI> being de∣sign'd to keep his Residence in <HI>Vienna,</HI> put himself upon the way thither from <HI>Lintz;</HI> but fell in∣to such a weakness upon the Jour∣ny, that he was enforc'd to go back. The Chief Officers ap∣pointed to stay behind in <HI>Vienna,</HI> applyed themselves with all dili∣gence to the putting their Orders in Execution.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
<P><HI>Schinta</HI> was now provided a∣fresh with Ammunition and Pro∣vision, and the Great Artillery removed from thence, the <HI>Mon∣tecuculish</HI> Army, which for a long time had been Quarter'd near the <HI>Presburg Ship-Bridg,</HI> moving likewise toward <HI>Moravia.</HI> The Count <HI>de Souches</HI> conceived some hopes of recovering <HI>Neutra,</HI> and prepar'd accordingly; the loss of that place being reputed not much inferiour to the loss of <HI>New∣hausel: Neutra</HI> being an <HI>Episco∣pal</HI> Seat, <HI>New-hausel</HI> only a Quar∣ter for <HI>Souldiers,</HI> which begat a greater Zeal, and Earnestness to∣ward the Recovery of the Place.</P>
<P>This Fort (in <HI>Latine, Nitria</HI>) lies upon the River <HI>Neutra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Neutra</HI> descri∣bed.</NOTE> which encloses the Fort like an Island, together with the high and low Town; and from hence it takes
<PB N="76" REF="47"/>it's denomination. The River is pretty large, but not Navigable, although of a strong and deep stream, abounding with varietie of Excellent Fish: The <HI>Castle</HI> stands upon the top of a Craggy Rock, and the Prospect from it, is fair and large, upon a spacious Level; without any Mountain or high place, within distance to command or endanger it. The Town under it is built upon the side of the Hill, declining by degrees, till it comes to the River, which parts the upper and the lower Town.</P>
<P>Within this <HI>Castle</HI> stands an Eminent <HI>Minster,</HI> of a strong and goodly Structure, overtopping all the rest of the Buildings abou it. There is also a Princely Pallace, which hath been formerly famous for Rich Furniture, and choice
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>curiosities of Paintings, Hangings, and the like. From without, it is encompassed with a brave <HI>wood:</HI> So that in fine, This Place consi∣dered within it self, together with it's Situation and Prospect, can∣not be said to want any thing re∣quisite, to the accomplishment of a most delicious Habitation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ʋpper-Town</HI> below the <HI>Castle,</HI> contains a new-rais'd <HI>Fran∣ciscan Cloyster,</HI> and many other fair Fabricks, and Houses lately Erected. In this Town were ga∣thered together many Rarities, not onely of strange Birds and Beasts, but also of Mechanical and Artificial Works. Now albeit, that this Fort, in respect of it's Site and Fortification, might well enough Stile it self Impregnable, as in former times it has ever been reputed, (nor indeed was it ever
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>Assaulted till now) yet were not all these advantages sufficient to Maintain it, against the Malice and Treachery of a single Person, who without any Opposition, or the least colour of necessity, de∣livered up this Episcopal Seat, into the Hands of Blood-thirsty <HI>Infidels:</HI> the Places of so many Religious Persons, and other <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> being at present supplied by seven or eight hundred <HI>Jani∣zaries,</HI> among, and with the rest, which the <HI>Grand Ʋizier</HI> has put in for a Garrison. To conclude, in outward appearance it was plain enough, that the taking of this Place, was no Winter-Work.</P>
<P>When it was too late, the Suc∣cour above mentioned drew near to the <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> and punish'd some of those that were too for∣ward in going over, and submit∣ting
<PB N="79" REF="48"/>to the <HI>Turk:</HI> as particularly in <HI>Bugans,</HI> which in truth brought great misery upon the poor Coun∣try people; who amongst so many coming and going Parties, were in a great straight how to behave themselves. Count <HI>Peter Serini,</HI> with some of the <HI>Auxiliary forces</HI> attempted a visit upon those in <HI>Bosnia,</HI> and the other Turkish Troups, which he had lately ruf∣fled near to <HI>Carlstadt.</HI> Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> likewise, did all that was possible by several ways and means, to gall and weaken the Enemy: Nor were the Gar∣risons of <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Comorra</HI> lesse Vigilant and Active; but every day looking abroad, and many times returning with Prisoners, and good Booty. The <HI>Silesians</HI> also stood ready upon the Bor∣ders, with a Body of Nine or Ten
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>Thousand Men, to prevent the <HI>Turks</HI> breaking in upon them; but about this time, there pass'd not any Action of great Import: The Enemy toward the Month of <HI>December,</HI> lying close and quiet about <HI>Gran, Offen,</HI> and <HI>Greek-Weissenburg,</HI> to which last place the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> betook himself in Person, taking along with him <HI>Baron de Goes,</HI> his <HI>Imperial</HI> Ma∣jesties Resident at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court.</P>
<P>On the other side, <HI>Abafti,</HI> with his <HI>Agents,</HI> were close at work in <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary,</HI> trying what good might be done there, either by force or surprize, and using their utmost endeavours to dis∣pose the <HI>Hungarians</HI> to a general Revolt;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abafti</HI> tampers with the <HI>Hungari∣ans.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Abafti</HI> in the mean time chalking out the way to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> which he thought most
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>conducing to his purpose, telling him, that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were most likely to be wrought upon by mild and gentle means, which might be so propounded, and re∣presented to them, that of two Evils, they might look upon sub∣mission to be the least.</P>
<P>In this Injuncture, Prince <HI>Ra∣gotzi's</HI> Widow began sensibly to perceive, that <HI>Hungary</HI> would be no place for her to abide in: Whereupon, She and her Son ad∣dressed themselves to his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> making Suit, that in this their distress, some place of Retreat might be afforded them within that <HI>Crowns Dominions;</HI> but to this Request of Hers, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> demurr'd; not only out of particular respects to Her Husbands demerits from that Crown; but for fear also of disobli∣ging
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>the <HI>Turk,</HI> by allowing her Entertainment: Beside that the <HI>Cracovian Waywood-ship,</HI> by rea∣son of the <HI>Turks</HI> drawing that way, was now in greater care and fear then ever, and with all speed sent a Messenger to the <HI>Crown-Marshal,</HI> to sollicite the Court to consider of it: The <HI>Waywood</HI> himself refusing to go in Person to <HI>Ʋkrain,</HI> and to attend other peoples business, to the hazzard of his own: Whereupon he not onely obtained leave to stay at home, and look to his Charge; but also to write an amicable Let∣ter to the <HI>Grand Ʋizier,</HI> desi∣ring that a faire understanding might be continued, and invio∣lably preserved betwixt him and <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, in <HI>December,</HI> his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty began his
<PB N="83" REF="50"/>Journy towards <HI>Regensburg;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em∣perour begins his Jour∣ny to∣ward <HI>Regens∣burg.</HI></NOTE> and in his Absence, the direction of the <HI>Frivy-Council</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> was committed to the Count of <HI>Swartzenburg;</HI> and now were se∣veral <HI>Rumours</HI> (how unlikely so∣ever) raised at <HI>Vienna.</HI> First, as if the <HI>Polanders</HI> intended to con∣ferre that Crown upon young <HI>Ra∣gotzi;</HI> to the end, to Incorporate <HI>Transylvania</HI> with <HI>Poland;</HI> and the young Prince was then to Marry into the House of <HI>Inspruck.</HI> It was bruited in the next place, that the <HI>Turkish Chiaux,</HI> who came along with <HI>Baron de Goes,</HI> brought with him <HI>Plenipotence</HI> to propound a new Treaty, and to offer new Conditions of Peace; but this was a Story that gained little credit; for who could be so simple as to believe, that so Crafty, Powerful, and so Insolent
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>an Enemy, should in the full course of his Victories, entertain any thought of admitting, much less of propounding an Agreement with a People, whom at this time, he did equally both hate and de∣spise. The <HI>Christians</HI> (one would think) had suffered too much, by their former Credulity, to trust him again: And yet the late Go∣vernour of <HI>Novigrad</HI> (<HI>Ledami</HI> by Name) was so easie, as to rely up∣on the <HI>Turks</HI> word, and to per∣swade himself, that by the sur∣rendry of <HI>Novigrad,</HI> he might compound for the full enjoyment of his goods in <HI>Transylvania;</HI> but he found himself deceived; being not onely bereaved of his Fortune, but effectually of his Life too, by the <HI>Barbarous</HI> usage of those perfidious <HI>Insidels:</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> it seems, not having as yet
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>forgotten the faithful services in time past, which he had rendred to Prince <HI>Ragotzi,</HI> and that this <HI>Ledami</HI> had had a hand in putting <HI>Barkay</HI> to Death: (the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> Creature, and who had formerly Usurp'd upon that Prin∣cipality, under the protection of the <HI>Turk.</HI>)</P>
<P>The Strong-Hold <HI>Filleck</HI> was hard put to it, and suffered much; but has hitherto neverthelesse stood firm, and defended it self to the utmost. The Fort <HI>Sent∣shai</HI> indeed, in which one <HI>Ro∣chart</HI> commanded, yielded un∣worthily. True it is, that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army in the Field, was not now so numerous, as it was said to be: It was yet strong e∣nough however to oppose the Country, and to keep many Strong Hold, and several Provinces, in
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>continual Apprehensions and Al∣larmes.</P>
<P>The Various Motions, and Counter-Changes of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, had now for a good while amused the <HI>Christians,</HI> giving them occasion several times to draw to their Quarters, and then back again, till at last, the Ene∣mies design discovered it self to be directly upon new <HI>Serinswar.</HI> In this <HI>Interim,</HI> little past of Moment, onely now and then the <HI>Free-Heydukes</HI> Issued out from <HI>Comorra,</HI> and sometime met with a Purchase betwixt <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Newhausel.</HI></P>
<P>About the Sixth of <HI>December,</HI> some Thousand <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> moved toward the River <HI>Mur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> de∣signe up∣on <HI>Se∣rinswar.</HI></NOTE> (which encloses the Fort <HI>Serinswar</HI>) with design to gain a Passage that way, and fall upon

<PB N="88" REF="53"/>the fight so long: A ful∣ler view whereof, may be gather∣ed from what follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>The Copy of a Letter from Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> to His <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty.</HEAD>
<P>THe Providence of God did never more signally appear then <HI>Yesterday,</HI> in the preservati∣on not onely of my self, and the Forces uner my Command, but likewise of all the Neighbouring Countries hereabouts: At which time the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> with a mighty Power, and in the open day, advanced toward us, bring∣ing with them an orderly well-framed <HI>Ship-Bridge,</HI> with all
<PB N="89" REF="53"/>things appertaining thereunto; and two thousand <HI>Tartars</HI> were sent before, to lay it, and make it ready for the rest of the Forces. The little strength I had, I dispo∣sed here, and there, as I thought most for my advantage, and kept Guard my self with three Hun∣dred Horse. About break of day, notice was given me by a <HI>Warn∣ing-Piece,</HI> of the Infidels ap∣proach: Whereupon I instantly moved into sight, and found that two thousand of the Enemy were already over the water; our con∣dition was now desperate, it being neither possible for me to make a faire Retreat, nor indeed advise∣able to think of one; in this streight we took up a resolution, and Char∣ged into the middle of their Body, where we were wholly encompas∣sed; but God Almighty, out of
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>his Love to <HI>Christendome,</HI> took a∣way the Enemies Strength and Courage: for after the first shower of Arrowes, (that look'd as if it would have buried us, although doing very little Execution upon us) such a consternation seized them all, that they presently fled toward the <HI>Mur,</HI> where Encoun∣tering their Fellowes that were coming over to their assistance, they fell into such a distraction and amazement, that they could neither Advance, nor Retire, nor Swim, nor save themselves by Re∣sisting. In fine, the face of the River was quite covered with Horse and Men; and of this op∣portunity, I made what use I could, taking not so much as one Prisoner; so that betwixt killing and drowning, not many of them escaped: Above a thousand of
<PB N="91" REF="54"/>their empty Horses we took com∣ing out of the River, but the rest, together with their Riders (saving a very few) sank to the bottom.</P>
<P>Hereupon, they sent immediate∣ly for their foot, (being not far from the place) but before they could come on, two hundred of my own Foot came up to me with two Field-Pieces, and with these we maintained our Ground till the rest of my men came in like∣wise from other Parts; and when we had fought out the whole Day, and into the Night, the Enemy drew off before Morning in great Silence and Indignation. This <HI>Yesterdayes</HI> Deliverance and Vi∣ctory must never be forgotten, either by us, or our Neighbours; and yet how it may go hereafter with us, in the condition we now stand; no man is able to deter∣mine;
<PB N="92" REF="55"/>the <HI>Turk</HI> lying still in a great Body about <HI>Canisia;</HI> and only waiting for an Opportunity of taking his Revenge. Touching the strength of their Army, and who Commands it, I cannot ren∣der your <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty any warrantable Account, having taken no Prisoners; but common Report speaks them to be <HI>40000</HI> strong; although I must confess, that to my Eye, from the other side of the Water, they did not appear to be above <HI>10000</HI> Men. Their drift was undoubtedly to quit scores for the Mischief my men had done them near <HI>Co∣morra;</HI> to Plunder, and Destroy the Island; to enter into <HI>Steir-Mark,</HI> where they might have Ravaged, as far as <HI>Gratz,</HI> with∣out any Opposition: After which, to pass the <HI>Mur;</HI> and again to
<PB N="93" REF="55"/>March about to Count <HI>Budiani</HI>'s Territorries; and so to lie upon the Frontiers.</P>
<P>This Enformation, according to the best of my Knowledge, I do present most Dutifully to Your <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, with my hum∣ble Request, that You will Graci∣ously be pleased, to Order some further provision of <HI>Men, Artil∣lery, Ammunition,</HI> and other Ne∣cessaries for these Parts; or we must all yet be Ruin'd at last. God preserve your Majesty in a good Government.</P>

<P>Upon this Rout abovementio∣ned, <HI>Serini</HI> with his <HI>Croats</HI> about a Thousand strong, pressed the Enemy so hard in the Rear, that at this Bout, there were slain and drown'd of them at least three Thousand: The Souldiers got good Booty, beside three Piece of <HI>Ordnance,</HI> one <HI>Morter-Piece,</HI> many <HI>Ammunition-Wagons,</HI> and other things that their hast would not give them leave to stay for; and so they Retired to <HI>Canisia.</HI></P>

Serini,</HI> &amp; his Fort, with the bitterest Expressi∣ons imaginable of <HI>Indignation</HI> and <HI>Revenge:</HI> Whereupon the Count Sollicited his <HI>Imperial</HI> Ma∣jesty for Aid, and at his Request, the Earl of <HI>Hohenlo</HI> was ordered with six Thousand men to be at hand to Second him.</P>
<P>While these beaten Dogs were licking their Wounds at <HI>Canisia,</HI> contenting themselves for a while to Bark, where they could not Bite. General <HI>Souches</HI> in Con∣junction with the Forces of <HI>Saxe, Brandenburg, Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Mo∣ravia,</HI> Marched fourteen Thou∣sand strong toward the <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> to make all good against <HI>Abafti.</HI> In their March, they passed as far as <HI>Neutra</HI> and <HI>New∣hausel,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="57"/>without any Encounter; no Enemy appearing in the Field, and the Houses and Castles along the way, which the <HI>Turks</HI> a while before had Garrisoned, were now found Empty; into which the Count put Garrisons to keep all open behind him. <HI>Lewents,</HI> he took by Assault, being but weak∣ly Man'd, and put about four Hundred that were in it to the Sword.</P>
<P>While these things were doing, <HI>Abafti</HI> plaid his Game another way; labouring by Craft and In∣sinuations, to bring over the <HI>Pro∣vincial-States,</HI> which were assem∣bled at <HI>Cashaw,</HI> to his Party; and so to Unite those <HI>Corporations</HI> unto <HI>Transylvania.</HI></P>

<P>It was now about the middle of <HI>December,</HI> and the Enemy made great Preparations to take the Benefit of the first hard Frost: Whereupon, strong Guards were set upon the Rivers; and <HI>Vienna</HI> was at that time much troubled,
<PB N="102" REF="60"/>with a Discourse of pulling down a good part of the Suburbs, to make the place Defensible. The Enemy had his Eye now upon <HI>Moravia;</HI> and for Prevention, the New-raised Forces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> were Ordered to the River <HI>Mark,</HI> to keep a constant Watch upon the <HI>Infidels. Presburg</HI> was also care∣fully provided for, &amp; a <HI>Subterra∣nean</HI> Retreat made from the City, to the Castle, for an After-game, in case the Town should come to be Taken. About the beginning of <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Suns.</NOTE> there had been seen <HI>three Suns</HI> (some say <HI>five</HI>) with several <HI>Rain-Bows,</HI> that appeared over the famous Fort of <HI>Dreis∣den,</HI> which began now to work upon the People: So that mens Minds were filled with Perplexi∣ty, both from Above, and Be∣neath. Some would have it, that the three <HI>Suns</HI> portended so many
<PB N="103" REF="60"/>mighty <HI>Princes,</HI> that should come to be Rulers over <HI>Germany;</HI> and briefly, every man had his Guess. (God grant Peace and Comfort to <HI>Christendom.</HI>) It was now daily expected, that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army should attempt something in Re∣venge of the Blow they had lately received near <HI>Canisia;</HI> and Prince <HI>Abasty</HI> was on the other side ob∣served to aspire more directly to the Crown of <HI>Hungary;</HI> but the Vigilance of Counts <HI>Serini, Ho∣henlo, Souches,</HI> &amp;c. still found means, either to divert, or disap∣point the most dangerous part of their designes. They kept how∣ever in a Body near <HI>Canisia,</HI> mak∣ing many proffers upon the <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> Territories; although to little purpose; Heaven and Earth con∣spiring to frustrate their Intents, by a mild and open Winter, and the Conjunction of so many brave
<PB N="104" REF="61"/>Commnanders, keeping a Watch, and check upon their passage. On the other sides; those <HI>Turks</HI> which lay near to <HI>Offen,</HI> and a∣long the <HI>Danube,</HI> (even as far as the <HI>Save</HI>) took great care to main∣taine themselves in a Body, and to provide before hand for the next <HI>Campagnia;</HI> furnishing <HI>New∣hausel,</HI> and <HI>Newtra,</HI> with Am∣munition, Provision, and all other things whereof they had need; and in particular with 40000. Suits of Cloths, for the supply of their tattered Troops: But Provi∣dence disposed otherwise of a good part of these <HI>Turkish</HI> Provi∣dings, by casting them into the hands of theGarrison at <HI>Comorra,</HI> which upon several Sallies had the better of the Enemy, and many times brought off considerable Booty into the Castle. As for in∣stance, on the 15th of <HI>December,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="61"/>they snapt a prize of 60 Wagons (drawn by 400 Oxen) laden with Ammunition, and comming from <HI>Gran</HI> for <HI>Newhausel,</HI> which they caryed off safely to <HI>Comorra;</HI> the Purchase being valued at 16000. <HI>Rix-dollars.</HI> Those Carriages were committed to the Convoy of 300 men, whom they surprized, and Routed, distributing the Oxen amnong the Garrison.</P>
<P>About this time, Tidings were brought from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that 50000 of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> Forces were come thither, &amp; to the Parts there∣abouts, to take up their <HI>Winter-Quarters;</HI> and that there was a Monstrous Tax laid upon all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, in order to the carrying on the War against the <HI>Christians.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> were now at <HI>Five-kirk,</HI> and elsewhere waiting for a Frost, in great Bodies, having furnished
<PB N="106" REF="62"/>themselves with many Thousands of <HI>Sleds,</HI> for the furtherance of the Design; but the Season was so gentle, that they could make nothing on't. As on the other side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> toward <HI>Cro∣atia,</HI> there passed not any thing considerable at this time: So not much of Action neither, by the Forces of General <HI>Souches,</HI> which drew toward the <HI>Mine-Townes.</HI> A Party of <HI>Christians,</HI> in <HI>Turkish</HI> habits, adventured into <HI>Neutra,</HI> and killed some of the <HI>Turks;</HI> but the Castle presently took the Alarm, and put them to a Re∣treat, wherein they saved them∣selves, and carried away 20. con∣siderable Prisoners; but a <HI>Turkish</HI> Party from <HI>Newhausel</HI> to <HI>Schinta</HI> come not so well off; who sup∣posing that the Garrison, as well as the Artillery was removed; advanced so near the Place, that
<PB N="107" REF="62"/>what with he Guns from the Wall, and after that, a Sally out of the Town, 150. of them were kill'd upon the Spot, and the rest fled for their lives. They were now busie in <HI>Vienna,</HI> upon Mounting and fitting the Artillery that came from <HI>Schinta,</HI> and cast∣ing of <HI>Granadoes,</HI> and <HI>Field-Pieces,</HI> keeping an eye in the mean while upon <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary,</HI> where indeed the greatest danger lay, by reason of the Practises, and Insi∣nuations of <HI>Abafti:</HI> for preven∣tion whereof, the Counts of <HI>Ro∣thal,</HI> and <HI>Nadasti</HI> were employed to endeavour the upholding of the People in their Obedience. To which purpose, the Forces under the command of General <HI>Souches,</HI> where very serviceable: There was good hope likewise, that the <HI>Hungarian Palatine</HI> at <HI>Newsol,</HI> might have done some
<PB N="108" REF="63"/>good upon them, against the flat∣teries of <HI>Abafti;</HI> but he excused himself in regard that he was neither in health; nor if he were, could he pretend to so much In∣terest as to prevail upon them; beside, that he mistrusted <HI>Cashaw,</HI> and other places in <HI>Hungary</HI> would take it ill at his hand: So that the Counts before mentio∣ned, were forced to return, and seek their way through <HI>Po∣land,</HI> into <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary:</HI> Nei∣ther were the Inhabitants of the <HI>Mine Towns</HI> any kinder to the Forces that were sent to their Re∣lief; but partly, by the ill usage they found among the <HI>Hungari∣ans;</HI> &amp; partly, upon necessity they were forced to go back, leaving many of their Companions be∣hind them, that dyed of Surfets, and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Feavours. In fine, the <HI>Germans,</HI> and <HI>Hunga∣rians</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="63"/>could not set their Horses together; and <HI>Ahafti</HI> making use of their Divisions, betwixt fear, and perswasion, drew a great Par∣ty to his side. These heart-burn∣ings among the <HI>Christians,</HI> were of great service to the <HI>Infidels;</HI> Especially being encouraged by Letters from <HI>Zekelheit,</HI> giving Ad∣vice that the Garrison had alrea∣dy Revolted, and Expel'd their Commander, with all the chief Officers out of the Castle, upon pretence, that they had received thirteen Months Pay, that was then due to them, and kept it from them; openly declaring, that if they could get nothing where they were, they would serve another Master; (aiming no doubt at <HI>A∣bafty.</HI>) This Example had so great an influence upon other pla∣ces, that toward the end of this year, the whole <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="64"/>seem'd to be upon a desperate Pin.</P>
<P>By this time his <HI>Imperial</HI> Maje∣sty was safely arived at <HI>Regens∣purg,</HI> where all diligence was used in preparations, and dispatches for the Relief of the <HI>Empire;</HI> E∣specially, for sending of Ayd to Count <HI>Serini,</HI> whose wants of Military Provisions, were drawn out to the last point of expectati∣on. It was also taken into thought, how to raise 10000. men in <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> without charging the Gen∣try, out of a desire to spare them, till the utmost Exigent of a Field expedition should require it. At this time also were designed the Respective <HI>Imperial</HI> Embassa∣dours, to be Employed to all <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Princes, and States, on the behalf of the Cause of <HI>Christen∣dom,</HI> against the Common Ene∣my; who threatens <HI>Hungary</HI> with
<PB N="111" REF="64"/>150000. men, and the <HI>Grand Sig∣nior</HI> in the head of them. The <HI>Great Ʋizier</HI> with 100000. men, to break into <HI>Croatia;</HI> and <HI>Aly Bassa</HI> with 50000. men to com∣mand in <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary;</HI> the sooner to bring <HI>Hungary, Austria, Moravia,</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> under Sub∣jection to the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>Beside the loss of <HI>Zekelheit,</HI> and the wavering of all <HI>Ʋpper-Hunga∣ry;</HI> about this time was brought the ill news of 200. <HI>Sporkish</HI> Horse going over to <HI>Newhausel,</HI> for want of pay; and of the defeat of a Party of a matter of 120. that in their return from about <HI>Weissenburg,</HI> where they had sei∣zed good Booty, were ovrtaken by 400. <HI>Turks,</HI> 12. of them kill'd, 20. made Prisoners, and the rest dispersed; Neither as yet did Matters go much better toward the Frontiers of <HI>Croaetia,</HI> the <HI>Grand
<PB N="112" REF="65"/>Vizier</HI> summoning all the Bor∣ders upon miserable Penalties, to provide for the numerous <HI>Tartari∣an</HI> forces, which had those Parts Assigned them for their Quarter; but Count <HI>Serini</HI> thereupon com∣manded immediately 600. <HI>Croa∣tians</HI> to endeavour the breaking of their design, who persued their Orders effectually, Burning all the Barns and Forrage for 12 miles round: So that the Enemy was forced to dis-lodge, and Retire.</P>
<P>Thus far the <HI>Dutch</HI> Relation of the last <HI>Campagnia;</HI> reserving what has pas∣sed since, for another occasion; to be∣gin from the breaking off of this: wherein the Reader may expect, over and above the scattered particulars of the more Ordinary Chances, and En∣counters of the War, an exact and pun∣ctual Narration apart, of Count <HI>Serini's</HI> late Inrode into <HI>Turkey;</HI> together with whatever else Remarkabel shall here∣after occurre.</P>
