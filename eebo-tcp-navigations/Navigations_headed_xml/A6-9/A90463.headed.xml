<P N="22">22 For <HI>Herbes</HI> they have of all kinds for Gardena, nd Physicke Flowers.</P>
<P N="23">23 That their <HI>Maize</HI> or <HI>Virginia</HI> Corne, it yeelds them five hundred for one, increase, ('its set as we doe garden Pease) it makes good Bread and Furmitie, will keep seven yeares, and maults well for Beere, and ripe in five Moneths, set in <HI>Aprill</HI> or <HI>May.</HI></P>

<P N="25">25 They have store of <HI>Bees</HI> in their Woods, make plenty of ho∣ney and wax and also tame <HI>Bees</HI> in hives about their Houses.</P>
<P N="26">26 <HI>Indic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> begins to be planted, and thrives wonderfully well, growes up to a little tree, and rich <HI>Indies</HI> made of the leaves of it, all men begins to get some of the Seeds, and know it will be often∣times the gaine to them as Tobacco (and gaine now carries the Bell:) their hopes are great to gaine the Trade of it from the <HI>Mo∣gulls</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> Countrey, and to supply all Christendome, and this will be many Thousands of pounds in the yeare.</P>
<P N="27">27 Their Tobacco is much vented and esteemed in all places, yet the quantities so great that's made, that the price there is but three pence a pound. A man can plant two Thousand waight a yeare of it, and also sufficient Corne and Rootes, and other provisi∣ons for himselfe.</P>
<P N="28">28 They begin to plant much Hempe and Flax which they find growes well and good, onely hands are wanting to this and other workes.</P>
<P N="29">29 Iron Ore and rich Mine are in abundance in the Land, fit streams and waters to erect Iron Mils, woods never to be destroy'd to burne Coale, and all this lye on great Rivers bankes, easie for transportation of Wood and Ore, and there is Stone fit to build the Furnaces with; triall hath been made of this Iron Ore, and not better &amp; richer in the World; his work Erected would be as much worth as a Silver Mine, all things considered: not onely to make all Instruments of Iron for the Plantations Uses, but for Building, Shipping, there being wanting in that Countrey no other Mate∣rialls to that Worke; Then the casting of Ordnance, and ma∣king them, will abound to serve all the World; so of Mussquets, Armour, all kinde of Tooles, and Manufacture of Iron Workes will be produced in abundance, so that it would become speedily the Magazine of Iron Instruments in every kinde, and at cheape rates; so that no Nation could afford them halfe so cheape, and all men know, that Iron will command better Mines.</P>
<P N="20">20 Skilfull Iron-men for the Works sent out of <HI>England,</HI> with the assistance of as many more able labourers there in <HI>Virginia,</HI> housing and victuall ready provided for them; (fitting places for Erecting, the Mills found out already, and Oxen for draught at hand,) the Worke in fixe Moneths time would be effected, and foure hundred pound charge to transport the twenty men to <HI>Virginia,</HI> with all tooles and necessaries for the Worke would doe it: and these Men for their incouragement to have halfe the gaine made of the Iron to be yearely divided betwixt the Undertakers and Workemen, the profit and gaine would be to the inriching of all.</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="4" REF="4"/>30 They have 4 Wind-mills, and 5 Water-mills to grind their Corn; besides many Horse-mills of several kinds, and Hand-mills for several uses: A Sawing mill for Boards is much wanted; one mill driven by water, will do as much as 20 Sawyers &amp;c.</P>
<P N="31">31 There comes yeerly to trade with them above 30 saile of ships, and in these not so little as seven or eight hundred Ma∣riners employed, (some say above a thousand, this is a conside∣rable thing) and they return laden home in <HI>March;</HI> (this is a good seminary for Mariners.)</P>
<P N="32">32 The Commodity these ships bring, is Linnen Cloth of all sorts, and so of Woollen Cloth, Stockins, Shooes, and the like things.</P>
<P N="33">33 Most of the Masters of ships and chief Mariners have also there Plantations, and houses, and servants, &amp;c. in <HI>Virginia;</HI> and so are every way great gainers by Fraight, by Merchandize, and by Plantation and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe-staves, Clap-board, choice Walnut-tree-vvood, Ceader-tree-timber and the like, is transported by them if Tobacco is not their full lading.</P>
<P N="34">34 They have in their Colony Pinnaces, Barkes, great and small Boates many hundreds, for most of their Plantations stand upon the Rivers sides or up little Creek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and but a small way into the Land, so that for transportation and fishing they use many Boates.</P>
<P N="35">35 They make Pitch and Tarre▪ (and there is materials in the Woods for abundance.) Also for Pot and Sope-ashes, Woods most proper and store: hands want.</P>
<P N="36">36 That for Mulbery-trees, the natural and proper food for <HI>Silke-wormes,</HI> they have abundance in the woods, and some so large that one tree contains as many leaves as will seed <HI>Silke-worms</HI> that will make as much Silk as may be worth five pounds <HI>sterling</HI> money, this some <HI>French</HI> men affirme. And now they desire <HI>Silke-wormes-seed</HI> which is sent them▪ and their hopes are good of the thriving of it: A <HI>Commodity</HI> that may soon enrich them all with little labour, care or pains; all Materials so plentiful and at hand, the food in abundance, the Climate warm, &amp; the work done in five weeks time, and within doors, by women and children as well as
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> men, and at that time of the yeer in <HI>May,</HI> that it hinders not any o∣ther work or planting, sowing, or the like employments; such an ad∣vantage, that had the <HI>Dutch</HI> the like in any of their Plantations, they would improve it to the certaine gaine in the trade of Silke from <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> which we fetch with great charge and ex∣pence and hazard, and inrich Heathen and Mahumetans greatly; but to these things lack Publick and State encouragements to be∣gin the work: but more of this in an other place, it deserves a full handling.</P>
<P N="37">37 Vines in abundance and variety, do grow naturally over all the land, but by the birds and beasts, most devoured before they come to perfection and ripenesse; but this testifies and declares, That the Ground, and the Climate is most proper, and the Com∣modity of Wine is not a contemptible Merchandize; but some men of worth &amp; estate must give in these things example to the in∣feriour inhabitants and ordinary sort of men, to shew them the gain and Commodity by it, which they will not believe but by ex∣perience before their faces: And in Tobacco they can make 20. <HI>l. sterling</HI> a man. at 3<SUP>d</SUP> a pound <HI>per annum;</HI> and this they find and know and the present gain is that, that puts out all endeavours from the attempting of others more Staple, and Sollid, and rich Commodities, out of the heads and hands of the Common people: So as I say, the wealthier sort of men must begin and give the ex∣ample, and make the gain of other Commodities as apparent to them, by the effecting them to perfection, or it will not (as it hath not hither unto) go forward.</P>
<P N="38">38 That they have health very well, and fewer die in a yeer there, according to the proportion, then in any place of <HI>England;</HI> since that men are provided with all necessaries, have plenty of vi∣ctual bread, and good beer, and houseing, all which the English∣men loves full dearly.</P>
<P N="39">39 That the Passengers also come safe and well: the seamen of late years having found a way, that now in 5, 6, and 7 weeks they saile to <HI>Virginia</HI> free from all Rocks, Sands, and Pirats; and that they return home again in 20 dayes sometimes and 30 at most: the Winds commonly serving more constantly, being Westerly home∣ward, the Easterly outward bound.</P>
<P N="40"><PB N="6" REF="5"/>40 That the mouth of the two Capes of Land, Cape <HI>Henry</HI> on the South, and Cape <HI>Charles</HI> on the North; the entrance in is in 37 degrees: that the first River up the West is <HI>James</HI> River, where most of the Plantations are setled and Towns: the second is <HI>Charles</HI> river on the North of it; and the third called by the Indian name <HI>Tapahanuke,</HI> the 4 river <HI>Patawoenicke,</HI> the 5 river <HI>Patuxant,</HI> the 6 <HI>Bolus,</HI> the 7 <HI>Saquisahanuke:</HI> at the head of the great Bay of <HI>Chespiacke,</HI> into which Bay these 7 rivers from the West side of it do all enter and run into, and so the mouth of the Bay issueth out due East into the main Sea between the two afore∣said Capes: the Baylies North and South, and hath a Channel in draught of 140 miles, and in depth between 5, 6, and 15 fathomes in some places. The widenesse of the Bay is from the West side which is the great Land, to the East side of the Land which joynes upon the Sea called the <HI>Acamake</HI>-shore; the widenesse &amp; breadth of this Bay I say, is about 9, 10, &amp; 14 miles broad in some places of it; and these 7 Rivers have their mouths into the Bay, not a∣bove 20 miles, each River is distant from the other: But this in <HI>Smiths</HI> Map is more at large described.</P>
<P N="41">41 That some English about a thousand are seated upon the <HI>Acamake</HI>-shore by Cape <HI>Charles,</HI> (where Captaine <HI>Teardley</HI> is chief Commander) now called the County of <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P N="42">42 That they have Lime in abundance made for their houses, store of Bricks made, and House and Chimnies built of Brick, and some Wood high and fair, covered with <HI>Shingell</HI> for <HI>Tyle,</HI> yet they have none that make them, wanting workmen; in that trade the Brickmakers have not the art to do it, it shrinketh.</P>
<P N="43">43 That since the Massacre, the <HI>Savages</HI> have been driven far away, many destroyed of them, their Towns and houses ruinated, their cleer grounds possessed by the English to sow Wheat in: and their great King <HI>Opechaukenow</HI> (that bloody Monster upon 100 yeers old) was taken by <HI>Sir William Berkely</HI> the Governour.</P>
<P N="44">44 All kinds of Trades-men may live well there, and do gaine much by their labours and arts, as Turners, Potters, Coopers; to make all kind of earthen and wooden Vessells, Sawyers, Carpen∣ters,
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> Tyle-makers, Boat-wrights, Taylors, Shoemakers, Tanners, Fishermen, and the like.</P>
<P N="45">45 Young youths from 16 yeers and upward, for Apprentises and Servants for some yeers, then to have Land given them, and Cattel to set up. Thousands of these kinds of young boyes &amp; may∣dens wanting.</P>
<P N="46">46 That the Government is after the Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> (that is well for men before they go, to know under what Lawes they shall live:) A Governour and Councel of State; and yeerly ge∣neral Assemblies▪ men chosen and sent out of each County, (there being 12 in <HI>Virginia;</HI>) these men Vote, and by the major part all things are concluded; and they are Elected to those places by the most voices in the County for whom they are chosen, and by whom sent.</P>
<P N="47">47 They have 20 Churches in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and Ministers to each, and the Doctrine and Orders after the Church of <HI>England:</HI> the Ministers Livings are esteemed worth at least 100. <HI>l per an.</HI> they are paid by each planter so much Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Pole, &amp; so many bushels of Corn: they live all in peace and love.</P>
<P N="48">48 That for matter of their better knowledge of the Land they dwell in, the Planters resolve to make a further Discovery into the Country West and by South up above the Fall and over the Hills, and are confident upon what they have learned from the <HI>Indians,</HI> to find away to a West or South Sea by land or rivers, &amp; to disco∣ver a way to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>East Indies</HI> or unto some other Sea that shal carry them thither; For Sir <HI>Francis Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke</HI> was on the back side of <HI>Virginia</HI> in his voyage about the world in 37 degrees just opposite to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and called <HI>Nova Albion,</HI> and by the Natives kind∣ly used: And now all the question is only how broad the Land may be to that place from the head of <HI>James</HI> River above the Falls, but all men conclude if it be not narrow, yet that there is and will be found the like rivers issuing into a South Sea or a West Sea on the other side of those Hills, as there is on this side when they run from the West down into a East Sea after a course of 150 miles: but of this certainty M. <HI>Hen. Brigs</HI> that most judicious &amp; learned Mathe∣matician wrote a small Tractate, &amp; presented it to that most noble
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> Earle of <HI>Southampton</HI> then Governour of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Compa∣ny in <HI>England, Ann.</HI> 1623. to which I referre for a full infor∣mation.</P>
<P>And by such a Discovery the Planters in <HI>Virginia,</HI> shall gain the rich trade of the <HI>East India,</HI> and so cause it to be driven through the Continent of <HI>Virginia,</HI> part by Land, and part by Water, and in a most gainfull way and safe, and far lesse expenceful and dangerous, then now it is.</P>
<P>And they doubt not to find some rich and beneficiall Country, and commodities not yet known to the world that lies West and by South now from their present Plantation.</P>
<P N="49">49 That the <HI>Swedes</HI> have come and crept into a River called <HI>Delawar,</HI> that is, within the limits of <HI>Virginia</HI> in 38 degrees and 30 min. it lies, and are there planted▪ 100 of them drive a great and se∣cret trade of Furs, which they trade for with the Natives: it is but 2 dayes journey by land from our Plantations, and a dayes sail by Sea from Cape <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P N="50">50 And again, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have stoln into a River called <HI>Hudsons</HI> river in the limits also o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Virginia</HI> (and about 39 degrees) they have built a strong Fort there, and call it <HI>Prince Maurice</HI> and <HI>New Netherlands,</HI> they drive a trade of Furres there with the Na∣tives for above ten thousand pounds a yeer.</P>
<P REND="block">These two Plantations are between <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New Eng∣land</HI> on our side of Cape <HI>Cood</HI> which parts us and <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>Thus are the <HI>English</HI> nosed in all places, and out-traded by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they would not suffer the <HI>English</HI> to use them so: But they have vigilant <HI>States men,</HI> and advance all they can for a Common good, and will not spare any incouragements to their people to dis∣cover.</P>
<P>But it is well known, that our <HI>English</HI> Plantations have had little countenances, nay, that our <HI>Statesmen</HI> (when time was) had store of <HI>Gondemores</HI> gold to destroy and discountenance the Plantation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and he effected it in a great part, by dissolving the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> Company, wherein most of the Nobility, Gentry, Corporate Cities, and most Merchants of <HI>England,</HI> were Interested and Engaged; after the expence of some hundred of thousands of pounds: For <HI>Gundemore</HI> did affirme to his Friends, that hee had Commission from his Master to ruine that <HI>Plantation.</HI> For, said he, should they thrive and goe on increasing, as they have done under the Government of that Popular L. of <HI>Southampton</HI> my Masters <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and his <HI>Mexico</HI> would shortly be visi∣ted by Sea and by Land, from those Planters in <HI>Virginia.</HI> And Marquis <HI>Hambleton</HI> told the Earle of <HI>Southampton,</HI> that <HI>Gun∣demore</HI> said to King <HI>James,</HI> that the <HI>Virginia</HI> Courts, was but a Seminarie to a Seditious Parliament. But this is but a touch by the way, and for a future <HI>Item</HI> to our Countrey not to despise Plantations.</P>
<P N="51">51 The Land in <HI>Virginia</HI> is most fruitfull, and produceth, with very great increase, whatsoever is committed into the Bow∣ells of it, Planted▪ Sowed. A fat rich Soile every where wate∣red with many fine Springs, small Rivolets, and wholesome Waters.</P>
<P N="52">52 The Countrey is with pleasant rising small Ascents and Descents, Valleys, Hills, Meadowes, and some levell Upland: Its Woody all over, but where labour hath cleared the ground from Trees, and this truely is the great labour in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to fell Trees, and to get up the Roots, and so make cleare ground for the Plow.</P>
<P N="53">53 Stones, and Rocks, and Quarries of severall kinds, and very fit for the Iron Furnaces (as triall hath been made to endure fire) are in divers places found in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P N="54">54 There is divers skins of Beasts for Merchandize and u∣ses, as Beavers, Otters, Squirrels, wild Cats, and Christall is there found.</P>
<P N="55">55 Divers kinds of Druggs, Gummes, Dyes, Paints, that the <HI>Indians</HI> use.</P>
<P N="56">56 There is a kind of Flax the <HI>Indians</HI> use to make threeds of and strings, we call it silke grasse, i'ts fine to make both Lin∣nen
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> and Stuffe of it; abundance in many places of it groweth.</P>
<P N="57">57 To the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>James</HI> River, some fiftie miles by Land, and eighty by Sea, lyes the River <HI>Chawanok:</HI> whither Master <HI>Porey</HI> went by Land, and reported, the King there told him, that within ten days Journey <HI>Westward</HI> towards Sun set∣ting, there were a people that did gather out of a River sand, the which they washed in <HI>Sives,</HI> and had a thing out of it, that they then put into the Fire, which melted, &amp; became like to our Copper, and offered to send some of his People to guide him to that place. But master <HI>Porey</HI> being not provided with men as he would have had of <HI>English,</HI> he returned to Sir <HI>George Yearly,</HI> and acquainted him with the Relation. But before they could prepare for the Journey, and Discovery, the first Massa∣cre happened, and so to this day it hath beene unattempted. The Company also in <HI>England</HI> was dissolved, their Patent most unjustly, against all Law and Conscience, taken from them. Procured by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gold and Faction, and the Colony never looked after, whether sinke or swimme; and hath now these twenty foure yeares since, laboured for life, and onely to subsist with much adoe; The Cattell then left, increased to what you heare, and in all these many yeares no more People in it, and they having little Incouragement, and great unce∣tainties, whether ever to be continued a Colony, whereby men have had no heart to Plant for Posterity, but every man for the present, Planted Tobacco to get a livelyhood by it.</P>
<P>And had not this present Governour beene sent as hee was, and continued, who hath done all a Gentleman could doe to mainetaine it alive. It had upon this second Massacre beene utterly deserted and ruinated; as things stand in our owne Land. If any demand the cause of this late Massacre, all having been forgiven and forgotten, what the <HI>Indians</HI> did the first time; Those that are Planters there, write the occasion of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> doing so wicked an Act, was. ☞ That some of them
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> confessed, That their great King was by some <HI>English</HI> Infor∣med, that all was under the Sword in <HI>England,</HI> in their Native Countrey, and such divisions in our Land; That now was his time, or never, to roote out all the <HI>English▪</HI> For those that they could not surprize and kill under the feigned masque of Friendship and feasting, and the rest would be by wants; and having no supplyes from their own Countrey which could not helpe them, be suddenly Consumed and Famished. The <HI>Indians</HI> Allaruming them night and day, and killing all their Cattell, as with ease they might doe, and by destroying in the nights, all their Corne Fields, which the <HI>English</HI> could not defend. All this had (as they write) taken full effect, if God had not abated the Cou∣rages of the Savages in that moment of time, they so treache∣rously slew the <HI>English;</HI> who were presently (the Act done) so affrighted in their owne minds, that they had not the heart to follow the Counsells their King had commanded: but to the admiration of the <HI>English,</HI> prosecuted not their opportuni∣tie, nor were constant to their owne Principles, But fled away and retyred themselves many miles distant off the Colony; which little space of time gave the <HI>English</HI> opportunity to ga∣ther themselves together, call an Assembly, secure their Cattell, and to thinke upon some way to defend themselves, if need were, and then to offend their Enemies; which by the great mercy of God was done and effected; And the particulars of all is worthy in some other place to be remembred and manifested to the VVorld, that the great God may have his due Glory, Honour, and Praise for ever and ever, <HI>Amen, Amen, Amen.</HI> And now at this present the Colony is in good estate (and ne∣ver a third time to be so surprised by a seeming Friend.) And they conclude, their conditions are now, such as they may and will greatly improve the advancement and wel-fare of the Col∣lony, even by this late sad Accident; and the Pit there Enemies digged for them, they are like to fall into themselves, and their mischiefe will and hath assuredly fallen farre more upon their own Pates; since their great King was taken Prisoner.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
<P>And in briefe, they say in three Letters, that if God please, in mercy, now to looke upon poore <HI>England,</HI> that it fall not into a second Warre, nor relapses, but a happy Peace setled in their Native Countrey. Then they in <HI>Virginia</HI> shall be as hap∣pie a people as any under heaven, for there is nothing wan∣ting there to produce them, <HI>Plenty, Health,</HI> and <HI>Wealth.</HI></P>
<P N="58">58 Concerning <HI>New-England,</HI> that they have Trade with them to and fro, and are but foure dayes Saile off from <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI> that they have had many Cattell from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and Corne, and many other things; That <HI>New-England,</HI> is in a good Con∣dition for livelyhood. But for matter of any great hopes but Fish∣ing, there is not much in that Land; For its as <HI>Scotland</HI> is to <HI>England,</HI> so much difference, and lyes upon the same Land <HI>North∣ward,</HI> as <HI>Scotland</HI> doth to <HI>England:</HI> there is much Cold, Frost and Snow, and their Land so barren, except a Herring be put into the hole that you set the Corne or Maize in, it will not come up; and it was great pittie, all those people being now about twenty Thousand, did not seate themselves at first to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in a warme and rich Countrey, where their Industrie would have produced <HI>Sugar, Indico, Ginger, Cotten,</HI> and the like Commodities.</P>
<P>And its now reported in <HI>Virginia</HI> that Thousands of them are removing (with many from <HI>Summer Islands</HI> also) unto the <HI>Bahana Islands,</HI> neere the <HI>Cape of Florida;</HI> and thats the right way for them to goe and thrive.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng" SUBTYPE="summary">
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>Letters came now this <HI>March, 1648,</HI> re∣late further.</HEAD>
<P>THAT <HI>Opachankenow</HI> the old Emperour being dead since he was taken prisoner by our Governour, there is chosen a new one, called <HI>Nickotawances,</HI> who acknowledge to hold his Govern∣ment under King <HI>Charles,</HI> and is become tributary to him, and this <HI>March</HI> 1648, <HI>Nickotawance</HI> came to <HI>James</HI> town to our Noble Governor <HI>Sir William Bearkley</HI> with five more petty Kings atten∣ding him, and brought twenty Beavers-skinnes to be sent to King <HI>Charles</HI> as he said for Tribute; and after a long Oration, he con∣cluded with this Protestation; <HI>That the Sunne and Moon should first lose their glorious lights and sbining, before He, or his People should evermore hereafter wrong the English in any kind, but they would ever hold love and friendship together: And to give the Eng∣lish better assurance of their Faith, He had Decreed, That if any In∣dian be seen to come within the limits of the English Colony, (except they come with some Message from him, with such and such tokens) that it shall be lawfull to kill them presently; and the English shall be free to passe at all times when and where they please throughout His Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Indians</HI> have of late acquainted our Governour, that within five dayes journey to the Westward and by South, there is
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> a great high mountaine, and at foot thereof, great Rivers that run into a great Sea; and that there are men that come hither in ships, (but not the same as ours be) they weare apparell and have reed Caps on their heads, and ride on Beasts like our Horses, but have much longer eares and other circumstances they declare for the cer∣tainty of these things.</P>
<P>That Sir <HI>William</HI> was here upon preparing fifty Horse and fifty Foot, to go and discover thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thing himself in person, and take all needfull provision in that case requisite along with him: he was ready to go when these last ships set sail for <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Aprill</HI> last: and we hope to give a good accompt of it by the next ships, God giving a blessing to the enterprize, which will mightily advance and enrich this Country; for it must needs prove a passage to the South Sea (as we call it) and also some part of <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor <HI>Sir William,</HI> caused half a bushel of Rice (which he had procured) to be sowen, and it prospered gallantly, and he had fifteen bushhels of it, excellent good Rice, so that all these fif∣teen bushels will be sowen again this yeer; and we doubt not in a short time to have Rice so plentiful as to afford it at 2<SUP>d</SUP> a pound if not cheaper, for we perceive the ground and Climate is very pro∣per for it as our <HI>Negroes</HI> affirme, which in their Country is most of their food, and very healthful for our bodies.</P>
<P>We have many thousand of Acres of cleer Land, I mean where the wood is all off it (for you must know all <HI>Virginia</HI> is full of trees) and we have now going neer upon a hundred and fifty Plowes, with many brave yoak of Oxen, and we sowe excellent Wheat, Barley, Rye, Beans, Pease, Oates; and our increase is wonderful, and better Grain not in tne world.</P>
<P>One Captain <HI>Brocas,</HI> a Gentleman of the Counsel, a great Tra∣veller, caused a Vineyard to be planted, and hath most excellent VVine made, and the Country, he saith, as proper for Vines as any in Christendome, Vines indeed naturally growing over all the Country in abundance: only skilful men wanting here.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P>That at last Christmas we had trading here ten ships from <HI>London,</HI> two from <HI>Bristoll,</HI> twelve <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and seven from <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Richard Bennet</HI> had this yeer out of his Orchard as many Apples as he made 20 Butts of excellent Cider.</P>
<P>And <HI>Mr. Richard Kinsman</HI> hath had for this three or four yeers, forty or fifty Butts of Perry made out of his Orchard, pure and good.</P>
<P>So that you may perceive how proper our Country is for these fruits, and men begin now to plant great Orchards, and find the way of Grafting upon Crab-stocks, best for lasting, here being na∣turally in this Land store of wild Crab-trees.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Hough</HI> at <HI>Nausamund,</HI> hath a curious Orchard also, with all kind and variety of severall fruits; the Governour in his new Orchard hath 15 hundred fruit-trees, besides his Apricocks, Peaches, Mellicotons, Quinces, VVardens, and such like fruits.</P>
<P>I mention these particular men, that all may know the truth of things.</P>
<P>Worthy Captaine <HI>Matthews,</HI> an old Planter of above thirty yeers standing, one of the Counsell, and a most deserving Com∣mon-wealths-man, I may not omit to let you know this Gentle∣mans industry.</P>
<P>He hath a fine house, and all things answerable to it; he sowes yeerly store of Hempe and Flax, and causes it to be spun; he keeps Weavers, and hath a Tan-house, causes Leather to be dressed, hath eight Shoemakers employed in their trade, hath forty <HI>Negroe</HI> ser∣vants, brings them up to Trades in his house: He yeerly sowes a∣bundance of Wheat, Barley, &amp;c, The VVheat he selleth at four shillings the bushell, kills store of Beeves, and sells them to vi∣ctuall the ships when they come thither: hath abundance of Kine, a brave Dairy, Swine great store, and Poltery; he married the Daughter of Sir <HI>Tho. Hinton,</HI> and in a word, keeps a good house, lives bravely, and a true lover of <HI>Virginia;</HI> he is worthy of much honour.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
<P>Our Spring begins the tenth of <HI>February,</HI> the trees bud, the grasse springs, and our Autume and fall of Lease is in <HI>November,</HI> our VVinter short, and most yeers very gentle, Snow lies but little, yet Yce some yeers.</P>
<P>I may not forget to tell you we have a Free-Schoole, with two hundred Acres of Land, a fine house upon it, forty milch Kine, and other accommodations to it: the Benefactor deserves perpe∣tuall memory; his name <HI>Mr. Benjamin Symes,</HI> worthy to be Chronicled; other petty Schools also we have.</P>
<P>VVe have most rare coloured Parraketoes, and one Bird we call the Mock-bird; for he will imitate all other Birds notes, and cries both day and night-birds, yea, the Owles and Night∣ingalls.</P>
<P>For Bees there is in the Country which thrive and prosper very well there: one <HI>Mr. George Pelton,</HI> alias, <HI>Strayton,</HI> a ancient planter of twenty five yeers standing that had store of them, he made thirty pounds a yeer profit of them; but by misfortune his house was burnt down, and many of his Hives perished, he makes excellent good Matheglin, a pleasant and strong drink, and it serves him and his family for good liquor: If men would endea∣vour to increase this kind of creature, there would be here in a short time abundance of VVax and Honey, for there is all the Country over delicate food for Bees, and there is also Bees naturally in the Land, though we accompt not of them.</P>
