<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is blamed in our <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that they are apt too much to admire Foreigne Countreys and Commodities; and exotick Fashions also, because they are either igno∣rant
<PB REF="3"/>
of, or do not sufficiently prize the Excellencies of their own native Soil; and herein the old Proverb of the <HI>English</HI> is verified, <HI>They never know when they are well.</HI> VVe have little cause (I thinke) to envy any other Countrey, if we rightly understand our own happy condition. I have in my <HI>Prolegomena</HI> written encomiastically of this Nati∣on; and in the <HI>Book</HI> have spoken snccinctly of each Coun∣ty. Were the Subject well
<PB REF="3"/>
handled, I suppose it would be a pleasing Argument to you who have seen a great part of <HI>England.</HI> However you will (I hope) excuse my boldnesse in prefixing your Name to this worke, since I was willing to testifie here∣in, how much I am beholding to you for your many great Civilities and Courtesies to me and mine. I have heard you often say, Though you had a great Office many yeers, and was Executor also to three eminent Persons of the Nobi∣lity,
<PB REF="4"/>
yet you scarce ever had any complaint against you for Miscarriages in your Place, or a Suit at Law with any (one excepted) in your whole life. These, with a plentifull Estate, and a healthfull Constitution of Bo∣dy are mercies, and lay a stronger Obligation upon you, to be carefull to please and honour that God, who hath been so propitious to you.</P>
<P>Your exciting of others, and your own munificence also to so good a VVork, as
<PB REF="4"/>
to the edifying of a specious Chappel, for the solemn worship of God, and setling also a compe∣tent Maintenance for a Mini∣ster, is laudable. Your prudent avoiding Suretiship (though you were solicited by two Royal Per∣sons to be bound for them) is consonant to Scripture-Rules. But <HI>(Sir)</HI> in your declining Age, it will be your wisdome now, and comfort hereafter, to lay up your treasures in Heaven, to mortifie all inor∣dinate affections, and to secure your interest in Christ. <HI>Nus∣quam

<HEAD>TO THE CANDID READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Did intend the publish∣ing of this first Book of the <HI>Kingdome,</HI> or <HI>Seve∣ral Counties of</HI> England, together with another of <HI>The Kings of</HI> England. But the Book∣seller desired to put forth this first alone.</P>
<P>I have made much use of <HI>Cam∣den,</HI> and if I could have added to his Chorography, some new and me∣morable things of each County, which he had not observed, I should have thought it might have been usefull for a native <HI>Englishman</HI> and Foraign∣er.
<PB REF="6"/>
Perhaps I have not been able to make additions to him in every County; but I hope I have insert∣ed some special things in the whole over and above what he (travelling over most part of the Land for that purpose) hath published. I have per∣used <HI>Andre du Chesne</HI> his <HI>Histoire generale de Angleterre d'Escosse, &amp; d' Irlande,</HI> Councellor and Geographer to the King of <HI>France;</HI> and also <HI>Draytons Polyolbion,</HI> with M. <HI>Seldens Illustrations.</HI> Those that have writ∣ten of any Counties or Cities of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as <HI>Burton</HI> of <HI>Leicestershire, Dug∣dale</HI> of <HI>Warwickshire, King</HI> of <HI>Che∣shire, Nordens Speculum Britanniae,</HI> his brief Description of <HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Har∣fordshire, Lambert</HI> and another of <HI>Kent; Crews Surveigh</HI> of <HI>Cornwall; Stows Description of London; Somners</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Nevils</HI> of <HI>Norwich;</HI> we having onely as yet the Descrip∣tion of those three Cities. I made use also of <HI>Lelands Itinerary,</HI> a Ma∣nuscript written to <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, and his Comment in <HI>Cygneam Can∣tionem;</HI> M. <HI>Burtons</HI> Notes on <HI>Anto∣ninus</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
his Itinerary. I have confined my self to <HI>England,</HI> not medling with <HI>Wales, Ireland</HI> or <HI>Scotland.</HI> I have in the <HI>Prolegomena</HI> related some things which may make the Nation illustri∣ous, and also acquaint Strangers with the <HI>Politia</HI> or Government thereof. I have lately received from M. <HI>Du∣gard</HI> a learned Minister in <HI>Warwick∣shire,</HI> and Rector of <HI>Barford,</HI> a me∣morable observation concerning the Family of the <HI>Fairfaxes</HI> there, the like whereto is scarce to be found in any sacred or prophane Writer, which coming too late to insert in <HI>Warwick∣shire,</HI> I thought good to mention here.</P>
<P>The matchlesse Family of the <HI>Fair∣faxes</HI> in <HI>Barford,</HI> two miles from <HI>Warwick,</HI> wherein there are four Ge∣nerations, and three of them double, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

4. <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Alice:</HI> his great Grandfather and great Grandmother.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Not one of these three pairs hath been twice married: and every pair of them is an honour to marriage. They all for divers yeares most lo∣vingly dwelt together in one house, and ate together at one Table. At last they are divided in habitations, but not in affections. The youngest pair with their children live at <HI>Wib∣taft,</HI> in the furthest part of the Coun∣ty, nigh unto <HI>High-crosse:</HI> the other two pair in <HI>Barford.</HI> The great Grandfather is above fourscore yeares of age; a very proper and lusty man; an honest and loving neigh∣bour; and one that hath born the Office of High-Constable. The most remarkable of these particulars have been put into this Latine Epi∣gramme by the present Rector of <HI>Barford.</HI></P>
