<HEAD>The Publisher of the <HI>French</HI> Edition, to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>TWo things, courteous Reader, I have to tell thee: The one, that this Book was really made by a <HI>French-man,</HI> and so that they would be to blame who should attribute it to any Stranger, whose Incli∣nations are biass'd against <HI>France.</HI> Hereof I was willing to advertise thee, to hinder thee from believing that Passion guided the Author's Pen. It was rather, as he protested to me, through a design to render himself knowing in the History of the Times, that he traced the Relations which I give to the Publick. The other thing I have to tell thee, and which I desire thee to take in good part, is, That I find my self indispensably obliged to declare unto my Country the Intrigues of her Neigh∣bours, to make her change her Master, or at least to give her another Face, by de∣priving her of her <HI>Liberty.</HI> This appears so natural, that I believe none can think strange of my Enterprize. I will tell thee further, altho it be of no great impor∣tance
<PB REF="3"/> to thee, that I have received what I here give thee from the Author's own hand, who made some abode in this Town, hoping to get himself advanced in the Troops, which his Electoral Highness is raising for the defence of the Empire: But seeing great Difficulties raised a∣gainst him, as there are elsewhere against others, who would shelter themselves from the Storm, he grew weary of at∣tending, and bidding me adieu, delivered me his Manuscript in exchange for some Books. I give it thee as I received it, without either adding or diminishing. Those that shall take the pains to read it, will see how the <HI>French</HI> neglect nothing to put themselves in credit in all the Courts in <HI>Europe;</HI> and that it is not <HI>Holland</HI> alone, which they endeavour to amuse by <HI>Delusory Promises,</HI> so to car∣ry without any opposition, what remains for them to take in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and perhaps to pass further, if they meet with no Obstacle.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF Deluding Promises SINCE THE <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unknown to any, that there have for a long time been two Powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> under the shelter of which the other States lived in repose and assurance. We know also that these two Powers are <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> who likewise recei∣ved succour from the other States, to the end that these two Crowns might
<PB N="2" REF="4"/> continue as it were in an equal poize, so necessary for the good of all the rest. Neither of them therefore was suffered to aggrandize it self to the prejudice of the other: So that if <HI>Spain</HI> formed any Enterprise, all the neighbouring Princes presently decla∣red in favour of <HI>France;</HI> if also <HI>France</HI> would make any Conquests, the same Princes failed not to oppose it. And thus they diminished the Power of that Crown, which began to be suspected by them.</P>
<P>It was by this wise Policy, that the Affairs of <HI>France</HI> were re-established after the taking of <HI>Francis</HI> the First: For the King of <HI>England,</HI> who had an Army ready imbarqu'd to make a de∣scent into that Kingdom, fill'd with desolation and terror by the Captivi∣ty of its Monarch, was the first to propose a League against <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth; and all the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> en∣tring thereinto, they obliged the Em∣peror to make a Peace, and release his Prisoner, who had been carried from <HI>Pisqueton</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> upon Conditions far less advantagious than
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> those he had promised himself after his Victory.</P>
<P>By the same wise Policy it was, that the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> suffered the <HI>French</HI> without any opposition to keep <HI>Mets, Thoul,</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> which they had seized on by surprize: For altho they had reason to be very ap∣prehensive of this Nation, which is but too much addicted to usurp upon its Neighbours, yet since it was at that time sufficiently embarassed to defend it self against the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> they thought rather of ma∣king it their Support against that House, which for a long time aspired after an Universal Monarchy, than of fearing lest it should become one day so powerful, that it would it self have a design to oppress them.</P>
<P>This Conduct lasted as long as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in a flourishing condi∣tion. Wherefore the same Princes, at least a great part of them, saw al∣so with pleasure the Strength of <HI>France</HI> augmented by the taking of <HI>Rochel,</HI> which often served no less for an Asylum to Male-contents, than
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> for a Rampart to those of the Refor∣med Religion. But since those of the Religion abused it, as we may say, by making it a Retreat for the Facti∣ous; GOD would punish them, to teach them another time, that Things Divine are not to be mix'd with Pro∣phane. In the mean time the Mareschal de <HI>Bassompiere,</HI> who saw farther than many others, had a Saying witty e∣nough thereupon: For being one day drinking jovially with some of his Friends, a time when Men ordi∣narily discover the greatest Secrets of their Heart, he told them very seri∣ously, he believed they would be Fools enough to take <HI>Rochel:</HI> Which I impute not to any design he had of making an Insurrection, but to his Foresight, that the taking thereof would be of as ill consequence to the Neighbours of <HI>France,</HI> as it was fatal to those of the Reformed Religion. In effect we may say, that this was the first Step whereby the Kings of <HI>France</HI> mounted to that supreme Gran∣deur, which makes them at this day dreaded by all <HI>Europe.</HI> We may also
<PB N="5" REF="5"/> say, that the greatest Fault which e∣ver the <HI>Hollanders</HI> committed in their Politicks, was, that they did not at that time assist those of their Commu∣nion, who might at this day do the like for them. But assuredly they considered it as a Rebellious Town, and believed not that it was lawful, according to the modern practice, to prefer ones Interest before whatever is most sacred.</P>
<P>However it were, People being very far from believing that ever <HI>France</HI> could be so powerful, as to think of encroaching upon the Liber∣ty of its Neighbours, they with de∣light beheld the Care that the Cardi∣nal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> took to pull down the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> and they were e∣ven vext, that the Conspiracies which were continually framed against him, and which every moment sprang up afresh, like the Heads of <HI>Hydra,</HI> often hindred him from succeeding in his Designs.</P>
<P>It was for the same reason that all the Princes, instead of opposing the secret Intrigues whereby this Minister
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> endeavoured to take the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had seized it from the House of <HI>Bra∣ganza,</HI> were on the contrary very glad that this Affair went happily on. I have read in a very curious Manu∣script, that all the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> furnisht him with Money for that pur∣pose; and that the Affair being ter∣minated according to their desire, they could not forbear publickly testi∣fying their Joy: Insomuch that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> coming to know it, failed not to reproach them there∣with. In the mean time the Success shewed, that if this had in some sort weakned the strength of that Crown, yet had it not however brought them so low, but that it was still capable to keep the Ballance which was so requisit in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Men were still confirmed in this O∣pinion, a long time after the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had lost <HI>Portugal.</HI> For not to speak of the War of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which he so long sustained against the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> wherein, it must nevertheless be confessed, he gain'd no great ad∣vantage,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/> altho he had the same time to do both with the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> he so well defended him∣self against the one, and made such great Conquests over the others, that if the <HI>English</HI> had not interposed, he would easily have brought them a∣gain under his Yoke.</P>
<P>This Equality between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> continued till the Year 1656; except we will say, that <HI>France</HI> was much lower than <HI>Spain</HI> in the Years 1648, 1649, and so on to the Years 1652, 1653, when she was within two Fingers breadth of her Ruine. For it was during the space of these four Years, that there were seen to arrive so many extraordinary things, which Posterity will with difficulty believe, especially when the begin∣ning of the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. which was full of so great Desolati∣ons, shall be compared with the fol∣lowing Years of the same Reign, which have been accompanied with so great Felicity and Power: For to comprehend all this in two words, it shall suffice me to say, that the King
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> was once in the beginning of his Reign reduced to have but two Pullets for his Dinner; and that now, to say nothing of his Table, which is such as befits so great a King, there is in eve∣ry thing else so extraordinary a Mag∣nificence and Profusion, that every one is obliged to acknowledg, that there is none but the King of <HI>France</HI> who can at this day do as he doth.</P>
<P>But not to stray too far from my Subject, I say then, that the Equality between the two Crowns subsisted till the Year 1656, at what time the <HI>French</HI> began to render themselves so redoubted in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that the other Potentates apprehended, that if the War should continue but five or six Years longer, <HI>Spain</HI> would in fine be subdued.</P>
<P>The Years 1657 and 1658 were yet more unfortunate to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who during that time saw themselves stript of their best Places: So that it began to be well known, that if they had any thing yet in <HI>Flanders,</HI> they were wholly obliged for it to the Civil Wars of <HI>France,</HI> which made her turn
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> her Arms against her self, instead of turning them against her Enemies. For in fine, it was easier for her at that time, than it is now, to accom∣plish her Enterprizes, because that no-body being yet persuaded of her Puissance, they beheld her Attempts without taking Alarm thereat. It was believed also, that she was obli∣ged for the greatest part of her Suc∣cess to the Alliance she had made with <HI>England,</HI> who assisted her with great Forces both by Sea and Land, where∣at every one was so far from taking umbrage, that they were for some time very glad to see the humbling of a Nation, which had rendred it self odious to all others by its vanity. For we see even at this day, altho <HI>Spain</HI> be reduced to so great a necessity that it is the Table-talk of all <HI>Europe,</HI> yet she ceaseth not still to keep up the same Spirit, insomuch that the Secre∣tary of Mr. <HI>de Fuen Maior</HI> said pub∣lickly not very long since at the <HI>Hague,</HI> That the French would think twice upon it before they entred into <HI>Flanders,</HI> because they knew that
<PB N="10" REF="8"/> their Places were better fortified than ever they had been; adding a thou∣sand other Rhodomantadoes, which I will not rehearse, because these sorts of things are of themselves so dull, that they rather nauseate than divert the Reader. In the mean time I will say here by the way, that when the <HI>French</HI> really entred into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and a Supputation was begun to be made of the Forces the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had to man their Places, and bring into the Field against them, they were found to have about sixteen thousand Men distributed into many Regi∣ments, a great part of which you would rather take for Beggars than Souldiers. After this it may be jud∣ged how well-grounded their Brava∣does are, and whether so small a number of Forces is sufficient to keep above thirty Places, which are yet left them in the Low-Countries, and to oppose the <HI>French,</HI> who are al∣ready near forty thousand strong and who can encrease their Army as much as they shall think fit.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<P>But setting aside all these things, for to go on with what I have alrea∣dy begun, I shall say, That at the time when <HI>France</HI> might have promi∣sed her self the Conquest of all <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> as I have already observed, she set her self to make Peace: Which I shall attribute to many things; in the first place, to the Jealousy she be∣gan to conceive of the <HI>English,</HI> with whom she was to share her Con∣quests.</P>
<P>For the <HI>English</HI> were to have <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> which is as it were the Key of <HI>France;</HI> and it did not suit with the French Interest, to desire the Neigh∣bourhood of a Power which had been so fatal to them. I shall in the second place impute it to the desire that Car∣dinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> the first Minister of that Crown, had to pass the remain∣der of his days in repose, and to give some rest unto <HI>France,</HI> which stood in need thereof, after having been tor∣mented, not only by so long a War, but also by an abundance of Edicts of this same Cardinal's Invention, who cared not how he ruined the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> People, provided he might have wherewith to marry his Nieces ad∣vantagiously. It was, in the third place, to withdraw the King from the Love of one of his Nieces, who is at this day Madam <HI>de Colonna:</HI> For altho the Cardinal could have been very glad that the King had married her, yet durst he not however at∣tempt it, especially seeing the Queen-Mother opposed it, and all <HI>France</HI> would besides have risen up against so unworthy and shameful an Alli∣ance. In the mean time, since the Peace could not be so soon made, nor consequently the King's Marriage, which was to be the Work of the Peace, the Cardinal married his Niece in <HI>Italy;</HI> and she said to the King, who wept when she was upon the point of her departure, <HI>You say you love me, I see you weep; you are King, and yet you let me go:</HI> Meaning there∣by, that if he had cordially loved her, there needed none but himself to hin∣der her Journey.</P>
<P>The King was for some time dis∣contented at his losing of Madam <HI>de
<PB N="13" REF="9"/> Colonna,</HI> and to get this Love out of his head, the Cardinal brought him to <HI>Lions,</HI> whither Madam Royal, who was the King's Aunt, came with her Daughter, whom they talk'd of mar∣rying with his Majesty. When Ma∣dam Royal had saluted the King, the King repaid her Visit, and went to see Madamoiselle <HI>de Savoy,</HI> whom he found before her Looking-glass, as she was putting on her Hoods. She had exceeding fair Hair, and appear∣ed to the King very handsom in this posture, insomuch that having seen her again afterwards, as he was sus∣ceptible enough of the Impressions of Beauty, he insensibly forgat Madam <HI>de Colonna,</HI> and began to love Mada∣moiselle <HI>de Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> knowing that the Alliance with <HI>Savoy</HI> might be soon clapt up, if they did not speedily take care to prevent it; and that this might perhaps prove an Obstacle to the Peace, which they desired at least as much as Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> could do: they dispatch'd away <HI>Pimentel</HI> to <HI>Lions,</HI> who arrived
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> there <HI>incognito,</HI> and was even a long time there, without any Bodies know∣ing it except the Cardinal, to whom he caused it to be told, that he was come to consult about the Marriage with the Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> which had a long time before been proposed on the part of <HI>France,</HI> but whereunto <HI>Spain</HI> would not at that time hearken, foreseeing well, as it has since hap∣pened, that instead of concluding thereby a sure and durable Peace, it would one day prove a Subject of new Differences between the two Crowns. The Cardinal knowing his Arrival, sent Mr. <HI>de Lionne</HI> to him, for to confer with him about the Propo∣sitions he had to make. And these two inferior Ministers having squared out a Treaty, the King had the civi∣lity to acquaint Madamoiselle <HI>de Sa∣voy</HI> with what passed, sincerely con∣fessing to her, that he should be obli∣ged for the good of Peace to renounce the hopes of enjoying her, wherewith he had flattered himself, but in the mean time giving her his Word, that in case the Treaty were not conclu∣ded,
<PB N="15" REF="10"/> he would never marry any but her.</P>
<P>This Promise in some measure con∣solated Madamoiselle <HI>de Savoy,</HI> who was in the highest measure afflicted at the coming of <HI>Pimentel.</HI> But whilst she was perhaps making vows for the breaking off the Treaty, Heaven dis∣posed otherwise in the matter: For Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> and <HI>Don Lovis de Haro,</HI> meeting in the Isle of <HI>Bidassoa,</HI> otherwise called the <HI>Isle of Pheasants,</HI> concerted between them the things whereon <HI>de Lionne</HI> and <HI>Pimentel</HI> could not agree. After which the Mare∣schal <HI>de Grammont</HI> was sent into <HI>Spain,</HI> in quality of Embassador Extraordi∣nary, to espouse the Infanta by Proxy.</P>
<P>This Ambassy was very superb; but it had this in it particular, that the Mareschal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> who was a Man of Wit, determined to ride Post into <HI>Spain,</HI> with a number of great Lords, imagining that this would ve∣ry well become the Ambassador of a young amorous Prince. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> knowing his resolution to
<PB N="16" REF="11"/> arrive in this Equipage, sent the Count <HI>de Taxis,</HI> Postmaster-General of the Kingdom, to meet him, who furnished him with Post-Horses for himself and all his Train, which was composed of fifty Gentlemen of Note, besides some other Persons of meaner rank. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> defrayed all his Expences upon the way, where there was as much honour done him, as if he had been the King of <HI>France</HI> himself. And after he had received, as he past through <HI>Burgos,</HI> the Diver∣tisement of the Combat of Bulls, he arrived in the Evening at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where they were forced to light Flam∣beaus to see him make his Entry, which made his Train, that was very magnificent, to appear with the great∣er lustre.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI> sent to receive him at his entrance into the Palace, by one of the best qualified Persons of his Court. Another came to meet him at the foot of the Stairs, and a third at the door of the Guard-Chamber. They were all accompa∣nied by the greatest Lords of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="11"/> who being all reassembled in the Guard-Chamber, conducted him in the midst of them to his Audience with the King, who expected him under a Canopy embroidered with Gold, having about him all the Gran∣dees of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had spared no Cost to appear in all their Magnifi∣cence to the Eyes of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the King saw the Mare∣schal <HI>de Grammont</HI> come in, he went forward three steps to meet him, te∣stifying the Joy he received by his Journey, and asking him about the welfare of the King, and the Queen-Mother, who was his own Sister. The Mareschal <HI>de Grammont</HI> having thank∣ed the King for his Civility, declared to him the Subject of his Ambassy; after which he went to the Queen, to whom having made his Comple∣ment, he gave to the Infanta, who was by her side under the same Ca∣nopy, a Letter from the King his Master; after which he discoursed her always uncovered, to shew that he began to speak to his Queen.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
<P>This Ceremony being finished, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> resolved to be himself the Conductor of his Daughter; and after he had assured the Mareschal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> that he would be within a little while upon the Frontiers, the Mareschal took leave of him, and came to give his Master an account of what he had done in <HI>Spain.</HI> Some days after the King of <HI>Spain</HI> arrived with the Infanta, and the two Kings having seen and embraced one ano∣ther, the Infanta was put into the hands of the King of <HI>France,</HI> to whom she had been already married in <HI>Spain</HI> by Proxy.</P>
<P>This Alliance made all <HI>Europe</HI> en∣joy a profound Tranquillity for the space of six or seven years, except the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> which was at Wars with the <HI>Turk,</HI> as was also the Emperor. The King of <HI>France</HI> assisted both the one and the other which gave a great deal of Reputati∣on to his Arms: For the <HI>French</HI> being in the presence of the <HI>Turks</HI> when they attempted to pass the <HI>Raab,</HI> so vigorously repulsed them, that, altho
<PB N="19" REF="12"/> they were seconded by the Imperia∣lists, they failed not to carry away the principal Glory of that Jour∣ney.</P>
<P>There arose also some little Trou∣bles in Christendom, as well between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> as also between that Republick and <HI>Bernard-Galen,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Munster.</HI> But <HI>France</HI> demeaned her self so in these two Rencounters, as if she had been more desirous to pacify all these Differences, than to excite them: For altho she took part in the War sometimes with the one, sometimes with the other, yet she comported her self in such a manner, that it could not be said, that what she did was with a design of profiting by these Disorders.</P>
<P>Hitherto there was not any appea∣rance of her Ambition or Insincerity, except you will say that she sufficient∣ly manifested it by her under-hand assisting of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to the prejudice of what she had so solemnly promised by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty. In the mean time it being against the Interest of
<PB N="20" REF="13"/> all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should make themselves Masters of that Kingdom, there were enough found who excused her Proceeding, whe∣ther they indeed believed that this was permitted by the Laws of Policy, or whether their own Interest made them believe so.</P>
<P>The first Spark that appeared of her Ambition, which is at this day ready to consume all <HI>Europe,</HI> was in the year 1667, when without re∣garding either the Faith of Treaties, or the Obligations of Blood, she set her self to deprive the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was yet in a full Minority, of his Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> Nevertheless since she durst not un∣dertake the War, without having at least a Pretext for so doing, she spread abroad a Manifesto, as well in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> as in the neighbouring States, whereby it was endeavoured to be insinuated, that the Queen of <HI>France,</HI> who had by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty been made to renounce what∣ever she could pretend unto, as well in the Successions fallen, as in those
<PB N="21" REF="13"/> that might fall, could not validly make any such Renunciation, nor yet the King for her, since she was not only under age, but what she did was in complacency to the King her Father, who had forced her thereun∣to. As to the King, it was also as∣serted, That he was not at all obliged by whatever Renunciation he had made, because by the Laws of the Realm the Kings could do nothing without the consent of the Parlia∣ment of <HI>Paris,</HI> who had refused to verify the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, seeing it so disadvantagious to the Dauphin, who ought one day to be Heir to the Queen his Mother. From all these reasons it was inferred, That the King might lawfully carry his Arms into <HI>Flanders,</HI> unless <HI>Spain</HI> did him Justice upon his Pretensions, which extended over all <HI>Brabant,</HI> and the best Places of the other Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> And this was founded upon an ancient Custom there was in those Places, whence all these Pretensions arose, by which a Daughter of a first Venter ex∣cludes
<PB N="22" REF="14"/> even the Sons of a second.</P>
<P>This <HI>Manifesto</HI> was no sooner pub∣lished, being composed by a learned Advocate of <HI>Paris,</HI> but it made some impression upon the Minds of the Peo∣ple, and principally of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> who altho they loved not the <HI>French,</HI> had yet rather fall under their Domi∣nion, than see themselves daily ex∣posed to their Arms. The Baron <HI>d' Isola,</HI> who bore a very great affecti∣on to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> by which he was employed in important Nego¦tiations, took at the same time Pen in hand, to disabuse the People knowing that a longer Prevention was capable to produce bad Effects. Having in fine composed a little Book in answer to the Parisian Advocate the Interest of <HI>Spain</HI> was therein so well maintain'd, that if that Crown had had Souldiers, who would have defended her as gallantly with the Sword, as the Baron <HI>d' Isola</HI> had done with the Pen, she might have laugh'd at all her Enemies.</P>
<P>In the mean time, since it was not by the point of the Pen, but of the
<PB N="23" REF="14"/> Sword, that this Quarrel was to be determined, the King of <HI>France</HI> en∣tred into <HI>Flanders,</HI> at the head of a flourishing Army, being followed by the Queen in this Journey, because he believed, that she being of the Blood of the legitimate Sovereigns of these Provinces, the People would therefore shew the less aversion for the <HI>French.</HI> He took at first <HI>Charle∣roy,</HI> which made no great resistance, the Place not being yet above half-built. Then entring into the Heart of the Country, he possest himself of <HI>Tournay, Ats, Courtray, Oudenarde,</HI> and some other Places of less impor∣tance. The Mareschal <HI>d' Aumont,</HI> who commanded a Flying Army on the side of the Maritime Towns of <HI>Flanders,</HI> seized also of some strong Places; after which the King laid Siege to <HI>L'Isle,</HI> which is the chief Town of his <HI>Gallican Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> vvere already so weak, that their Places had not above half the Garrisons that were neces∣sary for their Defence. As for <HI>L'Isle,</HI> they had made a little better provisi∣on,
<PB N="24" REF="15"/> and the Conservation thereof be∣ing of great consequence to them, they drew out some Garrisons from the most remote Places, and such as they thought secure, whereof they formed a small Army, vvith vvhich they resolved to succour this Town, The King knowing that they vvere in the Field, sent to the Marquess <HI>de Crequi,</HI> vvho commanded four or five thousand Horse on the side of <HI>Ardenna,</HI> to come to him without de∣lay. The Marquess <HI>de Crequi</HI> having received such pressing Orders, mar∣ched day and night to obey them; and having but a small Body, and that all Horse, which is not so em∣barassing as a great Army, that draws after it abundance of Luggage, made such speed, that he arrived at the King's Army three days after he had received his Orders.</P>
<P>The King, who spared nothing in Spies, having learnt that the Count <HI>de Marsin</HI> also on his side advanced at the Head of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops, de∣tached the Marquess de <HI>Crequi</HI> with a Body of Horse and Foot, to go and
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> seize upon a certain Passage; the gal∣lantest Men about the Court desired to make part of this Detachment, be∣lieving that there would be playing at Sharps: But the King restraining their Ardor, obliged them to stay at the Siege, which he prosecuted in the mean time without giving any relaxa∣tion to the Enemy. <HI>Marsin,</HI> who had at first made great Marches, knowing that the Marquess <HI>de Crequi</HI> had possest himself of the only Pas∣sage by which he could succour <HI>L'Isle,</HI> found his Courage cool so much the more, as the Post was advantagious to the Enemy, whom he could not undertake to force thence, without putting himself and his Army in most evident danger: He continued how∣ever to go on, and being arrived within three quarters of a League of the Marquess <HI>de Crequi,</HI> he pitch'd his Camp in a Place strongly seated, but which yet not seeming to him strong enough, he fortified by good Retrenchments. But scarce had his Souldiers put their hands to the work, when the King, who had made him∣self
<PB N="26" REF="16"/> Master of <HI>L'Isle</HI> by Composition, drew his Troops through the midst of the Town, which much shortned their way, and putting himself at their head, he took, as he went, the Marquess <HI>de Crequi</HI> along with him, and went to attack the Enemy, who on his side prepared to give him a good reception. <HI>Marsin,</HI> who was a Man of Wat, believing at first that he had to do only with the Troops of the Marquess <HI>de Crequi,</HI> bravely re∣ceived the first Troops, which ad∣vanced to force his Retrenchments; but when he heard the Drums of the Musketeers, whose March he knew, and saw besides the Troops of the King's Houshold, who were to be known by the Gold upon their Cloaths, which the other Troops had not, caused the Retreat to be sound∣ed, and endeavoured to make it with the least confusion possible. But the <HI>French</HI> breaking into his Retrench∣ments so much the more easily, in that there was none to guard them fell upon his Rear, which they put in great disorder. <HI>Marsin</HI> ran speedily
<PB N="27" REF="16"/> thither, and as he equally performed the Duty of a Captain and a Souldi∣er, sometimes giving Orders, and sometimes fighting in person, when he saw himself press'd, he wanted but little of falling into the Enemies hands by the fault of his Horse, who rearing up an end, threw him to the ground. In fine, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were wholly discomfited, and there were five or six hundred kill'd upon the place, two hundred that died of their Wounds, and three or four hundred that were taken Prisoners. There were presented to the King six Co∣lours, and two Standards, that had been taken in the Fight, and the King rewarded those that presented them.</P>
<P><HI>Marsin</HI> being defeated, the King marched against the Town of <HI>Alost,</HI> which altho it were of no great De∣fence, yet caused the Enemy some Loss. In effect, the <HI>French,</HI> puff'd up with the taking of <HI>L'Isle,</HI> and the Success of the Battel they had given the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> presented themselves in full day within Musket-shot of the
<PB N="28" REF="17"/> Town; but before they got them∣selves any shelter, they had a great many Men killed, without reckoning the Wounded, which were also in no small number. The Trenches being opened, and the Batteries raised, which began to thunder upon the Town, it yielded to the King, who put a Garrison in it, which he might have done at the beginning of the Campaign without the loss of a Man, for he had found this Place abandon∣ed, but he believed it not to be of so great consequence as it was, which is now but too well known, since it is at this day the Subject of the War wherewith we are menaced, not to say the Pretext. After the taking of <HI>Alost,</HI> the King retired to <HI>Arras,</HI> where the Queen attended him, and from thence set forth for <HI>St. Germain en laye,</HI> which was the Place where he made his Abode.</P>
<P>The happy Success which the King had during this Campaign, joined with the pitiful condition wherein the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were, who could not bring ten thousand Men together, made
<PB N="29" REF="17"/> the neighbouring Princes think it their Interest to oppose in time <HI>France</HI>'s aggrandizing her self any more. Thus carried on by the same Spirit, which had made them so often take the part of <HI>France</HI> against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they took then the part of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against <HI>France.</HI> The King of <HI>England,</HI> the King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made an Alliance together, called the Triple-League, whereby they united themselves not to kindle the Fire, which already burnt but too fiercely, but to endea∣vour to quench it; and in case either of the two Crowns should obstinately persist in the War, it was stipulated that they should declare themselves a∣gainst it; which Clause was expresly put in, not to irritate <HI>France</HI> by testify∣ing that this Treaty was directly con∣cluded only to oppose her Ambition. But <HI>France,</HI> who knew what to think of it, was so incensed thereby, and particularly against the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whom she accused to have procured this League to be signed by the others, that she resolved in time and place to
<PB N="30" REF="18"/> be revenged thereof. In the mean time, not being strong enough to re∣sist alone these three Potentates, she was obliged to promise, that she would lay down her Arms, if <HI>Spain</HI> would on her side consent that she should continue in the possession of her new Conquests, <HI>Alost</HI> being excepted, which she offered to restore. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not at first hear speak of this Treaty, and were re∣solved not to permit that the Right of Convenience should be established thus at their prejudice. But two things made them soon change their Resolution: The one, that whilst they were amused in talking of an Accommodation, <HI>France</HI> had all on a sudden seized upon <HI>Franche Comté.</HI> The other, that one of the three States began, as they say, to waver when it came to the point, having been gained by the Money of <HI>France,</HI> whereof it was more sensible, than of its own true Interests. The Mi∣nisters of <HI>Holland,</HI> who were em∣ployed in this Treaty, know whether I impose any thing contrary to truth,
<PB N="31" REF="18"/> and I know that it was they who first began to perceive so shameful a Com∣merce. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> therefore con∣sented that the King should keep all the Places he had taken, except <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> and the County of <HI>Alost,</HI> which he had already promised to restore unto them.</P>
<P>It is besides to be understood, that <HI>Franche Comté</HI> had been conquered in eight days; but that which rendred this Conquest so easy is, that <HI>France</HI> had gained the Governour, who after he had made this fine Bargain with her, retired to <HI>Paris.</HI> But as the Treason is much better loved than the Traitors, I believe they kept but a part of their Promise vvith him, at least I have been told as much by one that pretended to know it. In the mean time, those that were employ∣ed to bring the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to consent to the Treaty, as it had been propo∣sed before the taking of <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> let <HI>France</HI> know, that the concluding the Peace depended only on her. <HI>France</HI> stuck at the parting with so fair a Province, but it being
<PB N="32" REF="19"/> necessary either to do it, or to re∣solve upon War, she chose that part that seemed to her most for her ad-advantage, which was to give up this new Conquest, together with the County of <HI>Alost,</HI> according as she had agreed to do. Thus by the Entremise of the Triple-League was Peace re∣stored to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But before I pass any further, I must acquaint thee with so unworthy an Action then done by the <HI>French,</HI> that Posterity will scarce believe it, nor should I my self have believed it, had I not seen it with my own eyes. It was accorded by an Article of the Treaty, That whatever should on the day of the Ratification of the Peace be found upon the Lands of <HI>France,</HI> should appertain unto her; and that whatever in like manner should be found upon the Lands of <HI>Spain,</HI> should appertain to the Crown of <HI>Spain. France</HI> therefore, designing to make her advantage of this Article, caused, before the coming of the Ratificati∣on, the Ax to be set to a Wood of tall over-grown Trees, which was
<PB N="33" REF="19"/> upon the Lands of <HI>Spain,</HI> and having fell'd the Timber, transported it into her own Lands, that when the Rati∣fication should come, she might dis∣pose thereof at her pleasure. I appeal to the Duke <HI>d' Arschot,</HI> or the Prince <HI>de Chimay,</HI> to testify whether I say any thing but Truth; for I well know that this Wood belonged to one of them, tho I cannot at present remember to which of the two it was.</P>
<P>War was not the sole Affliction which this year befell <HI>Flanders,</HI> GOD sending them moreover so terrible a Plague, that there was scarce an House exempted from it. In the mean time GOD preserved the <HI>French,</HI> of whom, tho they were in Garrison in the Towns where it made the greatest ravage, and above all at <HI>Oudenarde,</HI> yet was there not so much as one that died thereof. Some impute this to their Temper, which is very diffe∣rent from that of the <HI>Flemings;</HI> but for my part I attribute it to a per∣mission of GOD, who, when he plea∣ses, saves some to take others.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
<P>The Peace being made, as I just now told you, every one enjoyed in repose the Benefit he might expect thereof. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> alone, for having laboured for the Publick Good, saw themselves exposed to the Ha∣tred of <HI>France,</HI> who expected only a favourable occasion to make them feel her resentment. The Occasion, or, to say better, the Pretext was soon found. As there is nothing suf∣fered to be printed in <HI>France</HI> without License, some French-men, who were not perhaps over-well satisfied with the Government, or who, it may be, had received some particular discon∣tent, published certain diffamatory Libels against the King and his Mini∣sters, which bearing on their Title-page the Name of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> as the place of their Impression, the King took great Offence thereat, as if it were not usual to put upon a Book the Name of a Printer that knows nothing of it. There appeared also sometime after a Print, wherein the King was represented upon a Horse without Bit or Bridle, with this In∣scription,
<PB N="35" REF="20"/> <HI>He knows not whither he goes:</HI> Insinuating thereby, that it was to no purpose for him to make so many Reviews, that he might sur∣prize one or other, since he would every where find resistance.</P>
<P>But of all which at that time ap∣peared, for I mention not here the hundredth part, there was not any thing better invented, or more to the purpose, than a certain Medal, on the one side whereof was represented Monsieur <HI>van Beuningen,</HI> who had the greatest share in managing the fore∣mentioned Treaty of the Triple-League: and on the reverse, <HI>Joshua</HI> staying the course of the Sun, with these Latin Words, <HI>In conspectu meo stetit Sol.</HI> Now we must know that the Sun was the French King's De∣vice, and that those who had invent∣ed this Medal, meant thereby, that even as <HI>Joshua</HI> had stayed the Course of the Sun, for to defeat the <HI>Phili∣stins;</HI> so Monsieur <HI>van Beuningen,</HI> who was called <HI>Joshua,</HI> stayed the Course of the King, that was upon the point to destroy the <HI>Flemings.</HI></P>
<PB N="36" REF="21"/>
<P>This Medal no sooner appeared abroad, but <HI>France</HI> highly menaced those who had made it; and since she accused the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thereof, they thought it became them to shew the whole World, that they were not capable of such Actions. Wherefore they gave in charge to their Ambas∣sador to disabuse the King and his Ministers, but to take his time so fit∣ly for the doing it, that it might not be believed they were induced to make this Excuse through the fear of their Menaces. In the mean time, to say the Truth, this Medal was ne∣ver either invented or made in <HI>Hol∣land;</HI> I have heard say that it was made at <HI>Rome,</HI> and was the Inventi∣on of the <HI>Italians,</HI> who being, if we may so say, plunged over Head and Ears in Repose and Delights, know not oftentimes what to apply them∣selves unto, unless it be to speak ill of their Neighbour. Others impute it to some discontented French-man, who had perhaps been frustrated in his desires, or otherwise ill treated. How∣ever it was, this I well know, that
<PB N="37" REF="21"/> there is not so much as one Person in all <HI>Holland,</HI> who will grant that it was made in their Country, which yet, if it were so, they would easily acknowledg, since they are not over-guilty of concealing what they do.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Peace, whereof I ere-while spake, was still in being, but withal it was plainly seen, that in the Estate wherein things were, it could not long continue. <HI>France,</HI> who was sensible of her own Power, daily, as we may say, provoked eve∣ry one with her Bravadoes; and there was none but the King of <HI>England</HI> whom she managed, because she knew he was strong at Sea, and would be a great Succour to those in whose favour he should declare himself. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who knew all the Steps which <HI>France</HI> made towards him, endeavoured on their side to keep up the good Intelligence which was be∣tween the two Nations, tho not with their ancient submissiveness, as belie∣ving it no less the Interest of the <HI>English</HI> to hold a good Correspon∣dence with them, than it was theirs
<PB N="38" REF="22"/> to live in amity with the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Things were in this condition when there arose a Difference be∣tween that Republick and <HI>England</HI> upon the Subject of Commerce. The Republick endeavoured speedily and amicably to terminate this Affair, but the King of <HI>England</HI> who was highly sensible of some former Indig∣nities of theirs, being incessantly sol∣licited by <HI>France</HI> to declare War a∣gainst them, was so resolute to make his own Terms in this Treaty, that the Republick thought fit to have re∣course to <HI>France,</HI> whose Interest it was not to suffer the King of <HI>England</HI> to become so powerful. <HI>France</HI> for some time amused their Ambassador as if she had a design to make a League with them; but as what she did, was only to have time to gain the King of <HI>England,</HI> whose Friend∣ship she courted at an high rate; she had no sooner perfected her Treaty with him, but she began clearly to manifest her Intentions.</P>
<P>Besides, I might here say, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were somewhat defici∣ent
<PB N="39" REF="22"/> in their Conduct towards the King of <HI>England,</HI> with whom mat∣ters might have been accommodated notwithstanding his great Pretensi∣ons. But since I know that the sole Obstacle herein was Mr. <HI>de Witt,</HI> Pen∣sionary of <HI>Holland,</HI> who had a great influence on that Commonwealth, I should be to blame, should I cast up∣on many, what was the Fault of one alone: For in fine, it was none but he that hindred the terminating the Difference with the King of <HI>England,</HI> who was willing to remit many things in favour of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> for whom he demanded some Esta∣blishment; but <HI>de Witt</HI>'s Jealousy of this Prince was so great, that he pre∣ferr'd his own particular Interests be∣fore the common Utility. Not but that he was a Man of great Wit, and who foresaw well enough vvhatever might be the Consequence of an Af∣fair; but he had his Heart too much envenomed against the House of <HI>Orange,</HI> vvhereunto I shall attribute all the Infelicities vvhich soon after befell that Republick. In the mean
<PB N="40" REF="23"/> time, I will not say here, as many others have done, that this was an Effect of the Intelligence he had with the <HI>French:</HI> For let none believe, that to make my Court to the Living, I will dig up the Dead, and make their Process. Believe not, I say, that I will assert a thing which I know not, and whereof it is necessary I should be very well assured before I speak. In effect, a Writer, who de∣sires to have the Reputation of an honest Man, must be very careful to write nothing whereof he is not ex∣ceeding certain. Not but that there are very often things related, which are somewhat problematical; but it is then the Author's duty to let the Reader understand, that he is left to the liberty of believing as he shall think fit.</P>
<P>I say then, speaking of Mr. <HI>de Witt,</HI> that altho he were a very wise Man, he was nevertheless mightily overseen in not making his Peace with the King of <HI>England.</HI> For to to come a little closer to the matter: It behoved him either to satisfy that
<PB N="41" REF="23"/> King in what he required, or to be sure of the Alliance with the <HI>French,</HI> that he might not have at the same time these two Powers upon his Back; but since instead of having the <HI>French</HI> for him, it was they, on the contra∣ry, that exasperated matters, he had no other way but to content the King of <HI>England,</HI> who had many times de∣manded the Restitution of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Offices which had been enjoyed by his Predecessors, with so much Reputation to themselves, and Advantage to the Common∣wealth.</P>
<P>Moreover, had I undertaken it, I could easily here demonstrate, That there was nothing so contrary to the Good of the State, as the having thus removed the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> from the Affairs thereof. But since it would occasion the believing of what I will not have believed, that what I should do therein would be to captivate the Honour of his good Graces, I shall content my self with saying, That if Mr. <HI>de Witt</HI> prevari∣cated in any thing, it was undoubtedly
<PB N="42" REF="24"/> in this. But be it how it will, the Republick learning from all parts, that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> made terri∣ble preparations for the making War upon her both by Sea and Land, did on their side what they believed them∣selves obliged to do, not to be so soon overwhelmed.</P>
<P>My design is not to engage here in the History of a War so long and te∣dious as that was; for tho I was pre∣sent at many great Actions which past therein, and can speak thereof with as much assurance as another, yet since they fought in so many pla∣ces, that one Man cannot have been at them all, I should be obliged to re∣port many things upon the Testimo∣ny of others, which is very often de∣ceitful, every one ordinarily adding or diminishing in his Recital, accord∣ing to his particular Passion, and sometimes according to the Love he has for his Country. I shall not how∣ever pass silently over the Things I shall think fit for my purpose, which is to shew the Ambition of <HI>France,</HI> and the Maxims she makes use of
<PB N="43" REF="24"/> to bring about her Designs.</P>
<P>It is very certain, that when the two Kings resolved to declare War against the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that Common∣wealth was in no good condition to undergo it, whereof I will alledg three principal Reasons. The first and strongest was the little Union there was between the principal Per∣sons of the State, whereof some blind∣ly followed the Passion of Mr. <HI>de Witt,</HI> and others on the contrary demanded the Re-establishment of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in all the Offices of his Ance∣stors. Every one knows the Contests which arrived thereupon, and that in fine, neither of the Parties getting the Advantage, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was chosen Captain-General of the State, but with so limited a Power, as it was easily to be judged, that if Mr. <HI>de Witt</HI> was not able to obtain his whole desire, he had at least obtained a part thereof.</P>
<P>But what nevertheless shews that his Spirit reigned not so much as it heretofore had done in the Resoluti∣ons of State, is what pass'd some
<PB N="44" REF="25"/> time after, and I am here going to relate. He perceiving that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by his winning Temper, obliging Conduct, and in fine, by so many excellent Qualities as are in his Person, daily gain'd new Creatures; and that on the contrary, his own Credit every day diminished: he be∣gan to think of sheltring himself from the just Resentment of this Prince. I know that he consulted thereupon Mr. <HI>de Groot,</HI> and another Person, who yet in my opinion is no great Politician; and that they both confirmed him in the Resolution he had already taken, to make a Levy of Twelve Thousand Men in the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> besides the For∣ces they were to raise in conjunction with the other Provinces. His design herein was to be always Master of these Twelve Thousand Men, who were never to go out of Garrison, and he would not have the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to have any Authority over them: wherefore he had already pitch'd upon <HI>Mombas</HI> for their Com∣mander, in an opinion, without doubt,
<PB N="45" REF="25"/> that he could not chuse a greater Cap∣tain to continue in Garrison. But the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> whom this En∣terprise every way concerned, but principally in respect of his Office of Captain-General of the State, which was thereby struck at, so vigorously opposed it, that all this great De∣sign vanished away in Smoke.</P>
<P>The second Reason which should have made the <HI>States</HI> fear the not ha∣ving any great Success in this War, is, That they had scarce any Troops to guard so many strong Places, whereof their little Country is com∣posed, those they had being moreo∣ver raw and unexperienced, seeming to have participated of the Nature of the Inhabitants, who are so ad∣dicted to Trade, that they seem now uncapable of any thing else. In ef∣fect, as a Man becomes a Smith by his often working in Iron; so is it to be believed, that no Man becomes a Souldier, if he be not often in occa∣sions of War. For this nevertheless there seemed to be a Remedy, which was to have recourse to the neigh∣bouring
<PB N="46" REF="26"/> Princes, who had good Troops on foot, for which they ap∣peared not to have any use; but when they would address to them, they found these Princes so alarm'd at the Designs of <HI>France,</HI> that not knowing whether she would not turn her Arms upon their Countries, they were glad to stand upon their Guards.</P>
<P>The third Reason, and the last, at least of those which I intend to alledg is, That there was no hope of ha∣ving any Succour from Princes more remote, whereof some were Pensio∣naries of <HI>France,</HI> and others so weak and timerous, that they seemed to be afraid of offending her. It was to little purpose for the <HI>States</HI> to re∣present to them, that their Interests ought to be common against a com∣mon Enemy, who aspired after an Universal Monarchy; they were in∣sensible, as I may say: Which I do not however find very strange, since they are not at present much less tho many of them are in a great mea∣sure stript of their Soveraignty. The Emperor nevertheless took fire at the
<PB N="47" REF="26"/> Consequences that were at that time remark'd unto him, and which we at this day see to be so funest; but ha∣ving spoken but a moment with Fa∣ther <HI>Emerick,</HI> or some other Jesuit, how far was he from being the Man he seemed to be but a minute before! They represented it to him as a scru∣ple of Conscience, to undertake a War in favour of an Heretical Re∣publick; and he so readily fell into all the Snares they laid for him, that when he was press'd for an Answer, it was plainly seen, that 'twas no longer the Emperor who spake, but the Monks, who spake through the Emperor's Mouth. Thus whilst the <HI>French</HI> King at the head of his Army struck a Terror into all that part of <HI>Germany</HI> which lies near the <HI>Rhine,</HI> did he amuse himself with causing to be sung in his Closet an Air of De∣votion, being encompass'd by twenty Jesuits, who were Judges of the Me∣lody, and who never failed to ap∣plaud these worthy Employs of an Emperor. It was then through their Counsel, that he would not give any
<PB N="48" REF="27"/> positive Answer to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> till he had first consulted Heaven at <HI>Marienzel,</HI> whither he went with unconceivable Superstitions, altho those that loved his Person, or the Good of the Empire, endeavoured to disabuse him by the way.</P>
<P>The Jesuits kept as close to him in this Journey, as the Shadow doth to the Body; for they intending to sell him, and it being impossible for them to deliver him, if he once took Resolutions worthy an Emperor they endeavoured to entertain his Su∣perstitions, to the end they might ac∣complish their Work. One time, when there being arrived a Courier, who brought pressing News, the Em∣peror bade he should attend, for that he was busied about other Affairs; yet could it not be guess'd what Af∣fairs these might be, no Body having been seen to go in with him, till an hour, or perhaps I should not lie if I said an hour and half after, four Je∣suits were seen to come forth, and when these Gentlemen were gone out, the Courier was brought in.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="27"/>
<P>But to return to the Voyage or <HI>Marienzel,</HI> every one expected to see the Emperor take a Resolution con∣formable to the Sentiments which the Jesuits endeavoured to inspire in∣to him, when one of his principal Ministers, whose Name I am mad with my self for having forgot, being thereby hindred from recommending it to Posterity, bethought himself of an Artifice ingenious enough, to ex∣cite him to act once like an Emperor. He had during the Night received a Courier, who brought the News of the great Success that <HI>France</HI> had had in <HI>Holland,</HI> and of some Intrigues she was working in <HI>Germany,</HI> but delay∣ed telling him thereof till he was rea∣dy to go to Church, for fear the Je∣suits should turn his Mind, if they had time to discourse him. He shew∣ed him then the News he had recei∣ved as he was going to Mass, pre∣tending that they were but newly arrived, and without expecting till the Emperor demanded his Advice, told him, There was no longer time to deliberate thereon, unless he would
<PB N="50" REF="28"/> lose the Empire with all the Heredi∣tary Countries. None knew where∣on he discoursed the Emperor, tho every one desired to know it, because they saw him speak fervently, and e∣ven with some sort of transport. But this Minister, being very willing that all those who were present, whom he believed to be well-minded, should help him to destroy the ill Counsels which the Jesuits might have given the Emperor, at the same time acquainted them with what pass'd, and then there was no longer heard about him any thing, but that there was no more time to be lost, and that War must be declared against the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Jesuits were not there to be consulted upon so important an Affair; they were already gone to the Church, believing that there would be no o∣ther Inspiration but theirs: But the Emperor being throughly heated at the News he had just learnt, no longer remembred the Lessons they had given him. Things however went on in all the Forms, as if he had
<PB N="51" REF="28"/> indeed expected some Inspiration from Heaven: For after he had prostrated himself with his face to the ground, and continued some time in this po∣sture, taking a Crucifix into his hands, he kiss'd it three or four times, then looking fixedly upon it, as if he ex∣pected it should answer him, he on a sudden lifted up his voice, and said: <HI>O GOD of Mercy and Goodness, teach me whether I must at this day entertain Peace, or declare War! Ought I to be insensible of the Enterprizes of</HI> France? <HI>and must I let her take from me the Imperial Crown, which thou hast put upon my Head, without endeavouring to keep it?</HI> He said no more, but ha∣ving again kiss'd his Crucifix three or four times, bowed himself down as he had done before; then raising him∣self again all of a sudden, he turned towards the People, and said unto them, That it was done, that GOD would have him make War; but that he took the same GOD to witness, that what he did was not through Ambition.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="29"/>
<P>The Emperor's Prayer, which was not very long, extremely pleased the Jesuits, who are accused of delight∣ing more in the Courts of Princes, than in the Church of GOD. In ef∣fect, those that know the Original of the Quarrel, which was not long since agitated between the French King and the Pope, attribute it to the Fear they had lest this Pope, who was not so Jesuit-ridden as his Predecessors, should oblige them to do as the other Monks, that is, to sing High-Mass, to say Vespers in publick, to rise in the Night to sing Mattins, and to perform all other Monastical Functi∣ons, which I neither know, nor ever shall know, having never been a Monk, nor yet ever intending to be one. They say, That the Jesuits, having already received some Marks that the Pope loved them not, whilst he was yet but Cardinal, were still more persuaded thereof a little after his Exaltation, he having spoken in an Assembly of Cardinals of giving them a Protector, as other Religious Persons have, that is to say, a Man
<PB N="53" REF="29"/> who should look after their Actions, and give an account thereof. And indeed there would be nothing more advantagious or more necessary for the Good of Christendom: for were it so, we should not at this day see so many Factions in all the Courts of Princes, where we observe Men who would have us believe that they have renounced the World, intermedling not only in Matters of State, but al∣so in the Affairs of particular Per∣sons; we should not see so many Hus∣bands discontented with their Wives, so many Wives refractory to their Husbands; so many Children disobe∣dient to their Parents, so many Pa∣rents unnatural towards their Chil∣dren: for in fine, their Charms ex∣tend even to the perverting the Or∣der of Nature, as well as the Order of Monarchies: but they take little care for whatever may be thought of their Conduct, provided they bring about their pernicious Designs. I might say many other things, which would be no less true than these; but since there is none, who knows not
<PB N="54" REF="30"/> that whatever passes at this day funest in <HI>Europe,</HI> is the sad Effect of their abominable Counsels, it is better to pass over what I have to say in silence, for to let the Imagination work, which is fill'd with so great an Idea of their Wickedness, that all I can say thereof is but a Trifle in com∣parison of what every one saith within himself.</P>
<P>But to return to their Conduct to∣wards the Pope. When they saw that he already spoke of giving them a Protector, they assembled their best Heads, and resolved to raise him up so many Affairs, that he should not have time to think only upon them. And since there was no Person in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> more capable to make the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> tremble, than the French King, who had already terrified so many other States, they insinuated into him by the means of his Confes∣sor Father <HI>le Chaise,</HI> that the Pope daily enterprised upon his Authority; that if he did not make a timely op∣position, it was to be feared he would still more and more entrench thereon.
<PB N="55" REF="30"/> A Canon of <HI>Pamiers</HI> in the County of <HI>Foix,</HI> happened to die just in the nick; to entangle matters, they cau∣sed the King to provide a Successor for his Benefice, tho it was not his Custom to do it; and the Bishop ha∣ving on his part provided one, as it was his Right according to the Usage to do, they so far animated the King against the Bishop, that he was at the same time proscribed.</P>
<P>The Pope, who was not only jea∣lous to conserve the Rights whereof he was in possession, but also to fol∣low the laudable Custom of his Pre∣decessors, who have usurped so ma∣ny, that they are at this day equal, not to say superior, to the greatest Kings, believed that his Authority was concerned not to suffer a Bishop to be ill-treated for having done his Duty. See then at the same time the Arms of <HI>Rome</HI> in the Field, I mean a great Number of Briefs, which are called in this Court <HI>Spiritual Arms;</HI> but than they should not make much progress which they might have done if they found no resistance, there was
<PB N="56" REF="31"/> at the same time opposed unto them a like Army, that is to say, Abun∣dance of Decrees of the <HI>Sorbon,</HI> the most part of the Doctors whereof were ready to do whatever the King would have them, like good and faithful Subjects, that is, without en∣tring into the knowledg of the Cause. There were nevertheless some of the most ancient amongst them, who having suck'd in the Love of <HI>Rome</HI> with their Milk, refused to sign an Act, which had been decreed by the Clergy, and which a President, accompanied by some Counsellors of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> brought in∣to the <HI>Sorbon,</HI> to be registred there. But since they would not have any there who resisted the King's Will, some of them were sent to the <HI>Pyre∣nces,</HI> to keep company with Bears, others into the <HI>Alps,</HI> and the rest in∣to the remotest Provinces of the Realm.</P>
<P>If I would here relate the Conse∣quence of this great Affair, I must undertake the making of a great Vo∣lume: for I should be obliged to
<PB N="57" REF="31"/> shew the Zeal of the French Clergy for the Service of their King, and their Rebellion against the Pope; Letters of the same Clergy of their inviolable Attachment to the Fortune of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, and of their Con∣tempt of <HI>Rome; Theses</HI> maintained in the <HI>Sorbon,</HI> wholly contrary to such as were maintained there before; the General of the Jesuits refractory to the Orders of the Pope, and submit∣ting to the Orders of the King; in fine, so great a Disposition in the Clergy and Nobility to shake off the Yoke of Roman Obedience, that if the Chancellor of <HI>France</HI> had not re∣monstrated to the King, That so great a Change could not be made in the State, without causing perhaps an Insurrection amongst the People, who in matter of Religion are even to Su∣perstition attack d thereunto, altho they very often know not any Points of their Belief; There was great ap∣pearance of the Pope's losing his An∣nates, and whatever else he draws from so great a Kingdom. But since the Recital of so many things would
<PB N="58" REF="32"/> engage me to a Subject wholly diffe∣rent from that which I have here proposed to my self, I will return to the Jesuits, and, to follow the Thread of my Discourse in what concerns them, will say, That as much as they were edified at the Emperor's short Prayer, for the Reasons I have before alledged, so much were they mortified at the Resolution he had taken to make War. For in fine, al∣tho they knew better than any other, that it concern'd not only his Inte∣rest, but also his Glory, not to suffer all the Enterprises which <HI>France</HI> eve∣ry day made against the Empire; yet as they made profession to take al∣ways the stronger side, it was alrea∣dy some time that they had abandon∣ed the Interests of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> on which Fortune had be∣gun to turn her back, to embrace those of the House of <HI>France,</HI> to which she appeared favourable.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to relate here all the Contentions they caused in the Emperor's Court, to hinder the Ef∣fect of the Resolution he had taken,
<PB N="59" REF="32"/> altho it would perhaps be a thing cu∣rious enough to be known; but I shall only say, That to retard the March of the Troops which were to join those of the Marquess of <HI>Bran∣denburg,</HI> who had newly embraced the Defence of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they put into his Head, that he should no sooner have diffurnished the Fronti∣ers of <HI>Hungary,</HI> but the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had secret Intelligences there, would make use of the Opportunity, with∣out regarding the Truce which was between the two Empires. And the Emperor being but a weak Prince, and disposed to take the first Impres∣sions that were given him, this thought sank so deep in his mind, that altho he were not so ignorant of the Affairs of the World, as not to see that the Marquess of <HI>Branden∣burg</HI> could do nothing without him, he ceased not to leave his Troops in their Quarters, while the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> at the Head of his went to seek Honour and Glory.</P>
<P>All the Grandees of the Empire, at least those that were faithful to the
<PB N="60" REF="33"/> Emperor, could not forbear speaking aloud their Sentiments of a Proceed∣ing so extraordinary, and so replete with weakness. In the mean time, as they left no way unattempted to undeceive the Emperor, it being believed also that they would do it, that wherewith his Eyes were envelo∣ped being so palpable, that there was none but he who could have been blinded with it. The Jesuits, fearing to see all their Designs overthrown, changed then their Battery, and see∣ing that the Fear he had conceived of the <HI>Turks</HI> was likely to be soon dissi∣pated, they gave him new Apprehen∣sions of the Forces of <HI>Poland,</HI> adding, that he who commands that People would no sooner see the Troops of the Empire busied about the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but he would fall on the Provinces that were most convenient for him, were it only by this Diversion to testi∣fy unto <HI>France</HI> his Acknowledgment of the Services she had done him, in procuring his Elevation to the Throne. They added hereunto the Intelligence which appeared between the French
<PB N="61" REF="33"/> King and the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> the Influence which the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> who was a <HI>French</HI>-Woman, had on the King her Husband; and in fine, the Pranks which the French plaid, to make that Crown take Arms a∣gainst the Empire.</P>
<P>All these Remonstrances cast the Emperor into new Irresolutions. He had just given Order for his Troops to go out of their Quarters, but he sent them a Counter-Order before they were gone any great way.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>French,</HI> ha∣ving taken the Field, and being en∣tred into the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> divi∣ded their Forces into three Armies, for to encompass the more of the Country. The King commanded one, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> another, and the Viscount <HI>de Turenne</HI> the last: The first was animated by the pre∣sence of the King; the second, by the Reputation of the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> and the third, by the Confi∣dence they had in the Wisdom of the Viscount <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who was besides one of the greatest Captains of his
<PB N="62" REF="34"/> Time. But that which yet rendred all sorts of Enterprises more easy to the <HI>French,</HI> is, that they found no∣body in the Field to make head a∣gainst them, and so little Resistance in the Towns, that it gave occasion to believe that they had Intelligence in the most of them. For my part, I will not affirm that it was so or not, but shall only say, that there was a great presumption of it in what was done by <HI>Dossery,</HI> who comman∣ded at <HI>Rhinberg,</HI> which he surren∣dred without expecting the Canon, altho there were above fifteen hun∣dred Men in Garrison, with good Officers enough to command them.</P>
<P>But if any thing were capable to give suspicion of Intelligence, it was without doubt that which passed at the Passage of the <HI>Rhine:</HI> For if I will examine what was done by <HI>Mom∣bas,</HI> who had Orders to repair thi∣ther, and what he himself alledges for his own Justification, I find him absolutely culpable, or at least very ignorant in the Mystery of War. He saith, That having received Orders
<PB N="63" REF="34"/> from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to repair to <HI>Tolhus,</HI> he went thither with the few Troops he had given him, and expected there those which were far∣ther promised him to defend the Pas∣sage; but that these Troops not co∣ming, he well saw that he had given him this Command only to destroy him, which made him ask of those Deputies of the States, who were joined with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that they would send him to some o∣ther place, where he might acquire greater Glory.</P>
<P>As for my own part, as I was pre∣sent at the Passage, so can I scarce suffer my self to be told, that there needed many Men to hinder the <HI>French</HI> from passing. If the Squadron which march'd against the twenty, or five and twenty Curassiers, which past first, had put themselves into the midst of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> instead of staying, as they did, upon the Bank, there would have needed no more to keep the others from passing, who came as yet but in a single File, one after a∣nother: but having been so impru∣dent,
<PB N="64" REF="35"/> or so cowardly, as not to ad∣vance any further, they gave the <HI>French,</HI> who were retired into the Water, Time to embody them∣selves, and then when they return'd against them, ran away.</P>
<P>Thus there is no reason for <HI>Mom∣bas</HI> to say, that he had not Men e∣now to defend the Passage, since he had more than he needed, as I have now demonstrated. But let us grant him what he demands, and agree, as he will have it, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> gave him this Command to stroy him; what, doth he thence con∣clude that he might retire as he did? What Souldier is there so great a Novice in the Trade of War, as to be ignorant, that when a Gene∣ral has once sent him to a Post, he is obliged to keep it till such time as the General causes him to be relie∣ved? For let not <HI>Mombas</HI> pretend to excuse himself by the Order of the States Deputies. The States have Right to command the Prince of <HI>O∣range,</HI> who is their Captain-General; but it belongs to the Captain-General
<PB N="65" REF="35"/> to command the Military Officers. And I do not believe, that a Deputy of the States would intermeddle to give a Command contrary to what the Captain-General has commanded; for so he would expose himself, if he should address to a Man that knows his Business, to see his Command slighted.</P>
<P>We may then hence conclude one of these three things: First; That <HI>Mombas</HI> having abandoned the <HI>Rhine,</HI> because the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> sent him not the Reinforcement he had promised him, was a Man without Courage or Experience: since Expe∣rience would have taught him, that it required no great Number of Men to keep such a Passage as that; and had he been a Man of Courage, he would have despised a little Danger to acquire a great Glory.</P>
<P>The second thing that must thence be inferred, is, That after he had been commanded by the Captain-General of the State to keep a Post of so great importance, he must be very ignorant in Military Affairs, to
<PB N="66" REF="36"/> believe that he might quit it upon sight of an Order, begg'd from and granted by a Person, who does not so much as understand Martial Disci∣pline, and whom the State sends to give Order rather in Political than Military Affairs, wherein understand∣ing nothing himself, he refers him∣self to him in whose hands the Com∣mand of the Armies is entrusted.</P>
<P>The third Conclusion that is to be drawn thence, is, That if <HI>Mombas</HI> were neither cowardly, nor ignorant of his Business, which, to do him a pleasure, I am very willing to imagine, he was at: least guilty of Treason. And what would incline one to be∣lieve that there was some such thing in it, is, That he had the Winter before made a Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he saw the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> altho I cannot find that he was known to him before; nor can I learn that he has had the honour to see him since, ex∣cept when he made his Escape from <HI>Nieurbruk;</HI> for Princes, as well as other Persons, have no great esteem for Traytors.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="36"/>
<P>But let us pass over in silence a Campaign so replete with Desolation and Misery: And indeed the remem∣brance of so many funest Things can∣not please either one or other: For if, on the one side, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do not love to have the memory renewed of so many intestine Discords; the <HI>French,</HI> on the other side, have no great reason to desire we should put them in mind of an infinite Number of Faults they committed at that time, and whereunto we are indebted for the safety of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces.</HI> But we may here say, that this was the Work of GOD's Hand, who being pleased to save this State, saved at the same time the rest of <HI>Europe.</HI> In effect, there was none but GOD a∣lone, who was capable to trouble the Judgment of the <HI>French</HI> to such a degree, as to commit the Faults they did: For we do not read in History any thing like that which pass'd at <HI>Muiden,</HI> the taking whereof drew on that of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and that of <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> would have been accompanied with that of all the Seven Provinces:
<PB N="68" REF="37"/> yet after that four of their Horse had made themselves Masters of that Place, instead of putting a Garrison therein, they set themselves to run a∣bout plundring the Country; but perceiving then the Error they were guilty of, they would have returned to <HI>Muiden,</HI> whereof it was impossible for them to get possession, the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> having sent Forces thither.</P>
<P>This Fault was attributed to the Marquess <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> Lieutenant-General, and Captain of the Life-Guard, who commanded the <HI>French</HI> in the Province of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and who had not much experience. In effect it was observed, that as he was al∣ways uncertain of what he ought to do, he made six thousand Men take Horse, when there needed but two thousand, and thus exceedingly tired his Troops, without drawing thence any Benefit: For as he was afraid of not succeeding, he chose rather to return very often without doing any thing, than to incur any Hazard. This Conduct made him be called by the Troops, <HI>The Peaceable General;</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="37"/> but when he commanded not in chief, he was as enterprising as another, what he did being only want of Ex∣perience, and not of Courage.</P>
<P>The Oversight at <HI>Muiden</HI> was the cause that the Marquess <HI>de Rochefort</HI> was recalled from <HI>Ʋtrecht;</HI> but as he was one of the Kinsmen and good Friends of Mr. <HI>de Louvois,</HI> he was not the more disesteemed for it at Court, the Government of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being on the contrary given to him. Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> was sent in his place, a Man more known by the Cru∣elties he committed in <HI>Holland,</HI> than by his great Exploits; not that I will deny him to be a very brave Man, but he was not much more knowing than Mr. <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> which was al∣ways known when he commanded a Body of above ten thousand Men, for the rest enterprising, and therein very different from him in whose place he came.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we are to know that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> having arrested <HI>Mombas</HI> on the suspicion he had of his holding Intelligence with
<PB N="70" REF="38"/> the Enemy, caused his Process to be made, and there was a great appea∣rance that he would be made an Ex∣ample to others; when <HI>Mombas,</HI> whe∣ther he was conscious of his own Guilt, as is probably believed, or that he had heard there is nothing so sweet as Liberty, bethought himself of making his Escape, by corrupting his Guards. The History of his Flight is very agreeable and diverti∣sing, by reason of many Accidents which arrived therein; but since that makes nothing to my purpose, I shall only say, That having traversed six Leagues always up to the Girdle in Water, and sometimes higher, he got safe to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and thence to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> where was the Prince of <HI>Condé,</HI> who had been wounded at the Passage of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> He saw that Prince at four in the morning, stayed with him above two hours, and retired from thence to <HI>Cologne.</HI> But let us make here a little reflection, and see whether this Interview, with all that followed it, be not an indu∣bitable Proof of the Intelligence he
<PB N="71" REF="38"/> held with the Enemies.</P>
<P>If <HI>Mombas</HI> had been faithful, how durst he, who just came from bearing Arms against <HI>France,</HI> whereof he was born a Subject, put himself into the hands of the Prince of <HI>Condé?</HI> Was there not reason to believe that he would cause him to be arrested? and that a Crown which prohibits its Subjects upon pain of Death from serving of Strangers, would shew it self much more severe to him, who was not only refractory to this Ordi∣nance, but had moreover so lately drawn his Sword against it? I know well, he hath told some that he was seized with this fear, and that it was for this reason he did not stay at <HI>Ʋ∣trecht;</HI> Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> whom he had caused to be told that he was e∣scaped from <HI>Nieuerbruk,</HI> and whose Protection he had demanded, having answered, that he did not advise him to come into any Place where he had Command, because he should be obliged to arrest him.</P>
<P>But let us examine a little this Ar∣ticle, and see whether it be not, as
<PB N="72" REF="39"/> they say, to cast dust in ones eyes, to talk on this manner. <HI>Mombas</HI> makes his Escape to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> he enters there∣into at open day, he traverses the whole Town; he goes to lodge, as I take it, at the Palace-Royal, where he used to lodge when the Town did not belong to the French; he causes the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> to be told that he was escaped, he asks his Protecti∣on: and yet he would have us be∣lieve, that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> knew not he was there, but that ha∣ving sent him word he should have a care of coming thither, he was obli∣ged to go to <HI>Arnhem.</HI> Let us rather say, that since it was the Prince of <HI>Condé,</HI> who had been concerned in all things the foregoing Winter, Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> believing that it still belonged to him to meddle in it, was very glad that <HI>Mombas</HI> should ad∣dress himself directly to him, not but that he himself would have been very willing to have had a part in this Intrigue, but because he feared this might offend the Prince, in whose good opinion it was his Interest to keep himself.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="39"/>
<P>But let us prosecute a little this Affair, and see whether there be any appearance to say that <HI>Mombas</HI> was innocent. He seeks out the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> sends him word by <HI>Des∣roches,</HI> Captain of his Guards, that he should be very glad of the Honour to speak with him, and, in one word, puts himself into his hands, whereas he ought to have stood more upon his Guard, after the Advertisement he had received from Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg.</HI> In the mean time, as if the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had not had the same measures to keep as the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> he sees him, discourses familiarly with him of all things, and after he had promised him his Protection, counselled him to retire to <HI>Cologne,</HI> till such time as he could incline the King to pardon him.</P>
<P>Here I should willingly ask <HI>Mom∣bas,</HI> Whether he be himself so much a Fool, as to think others silly enough to give credit to his Words? In ef∣fect, how can it be imagined, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> would not only have seen him, but also counselled
<PB N="74" REF="40"/> him to retire to <HI>Cologne,</HI> if he had not done this by agreement with the Court, who were very willing not to have it believed, that all the hap∣py Success they had in <HI>Holland</HI> was an Effect of the secret Intelligence they held with <HI>Mombas?</HI> For otherwise, in what hazard would the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> have put himself, who would not have failed to be taxed, for ha∣ving not only seen a Man that was proscribed, but having also taught him a Place of Retreat? From all this, let us conclude, that <HI>Mombas</HI> was truly culpable; but let us at the same time add, that there were ma∣ny others so as well as he: which gave him the facility of making his Escape from <HI>Nieurbruk,</HI> these other Persons having for that purpose made use of all that was in their power, for fear he should accuse them also, when he should once see himself upon the Scaffold.</P>
<P>In the mean time he was not left long at <HI>Cologne;</HI> for since they be∣lieved they had done enough to salve the Appearances; by divulging that
<PB N="75" REF="40"/> he had been obliged to make his E∣scape a great way off, he was soon called back, and had Orders to go to the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> Who howe∣ver testified no great confidence in him. He was, notwithstanding, very assiduous in courting him, and offered to do him service even in the most vile and abject things; and it was not long of him, had they been wil∣ling to give but the least credit to what he said, that he was not belie∣ved to be a Man of great Impor∣tance. In fine, he had not taken so much care before to hide his Treason, but that he gloried as much then in making it appear. He asked Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> to give him two thousand Men, to go and attack the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> at <HI>Nieuerbruk,</HI> vaunting, that he would traverse all the Inundation which was between <HI>Wordes</HI> and that Town, and would thus surprize him in the Rear, whilst Mr. <HI>de Luxem∣burg</HI> should on his side attack him in the Front: But Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> who besides that he believed him no great Captain, had not confidence e∣nough
<PB N="76" REF="41"/> in him to give him thus two thousand Men, endeavoured to abate his warlike Sallies; whereat he so much the more wondred, as that they began to take him at the age of five and fifty years.</P>
<P>Some time after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> resolved to besiege <HI>Wordes,</HI> at the taking whereof the French had in cold Blood kill'd the Bayliff, who had advanced to shut the Gates against them. This Enterprise was conducted with a great deal of Pru∣dence, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> having surprized the Vigilance of the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> who had taken the Field to put Troops therein; but since the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> knew not whether it were not <HI>Naerden,</HI> at which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> aimed, because he had taken the way thither, he turned towards that Town; and whilst he was going thither, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> invested <HI>Wordes,</HI> and setled his Quarters there. I re∣late this Affair rather than many o∣thers, because therein an Adventure befell <HI>Mombas,</HI> which will shew in
<PB N="77" REF="41"/> what esteem he was in the mind of the <HI>French,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI> Before the Duke of <HI>Luxem∣burg</HI> knew that <HI>Wordes</HI> was besieged, he resolved to succour it, altho the thing appeared difficult, for two rea∣sons: The first, because he had but few Men with him; the other, be∣cause the way to go thither was very strait, and besides, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had already retrench'd themselves at the Head thereof. In the mean time, as he wanted not Boldness, he resolved to give something to Fortune. For this purpose he detached the Marquess <HI>de Genlis,</HI> Mareschal de Camp, to draw together from the Neighbouring Quarters the most Troops he possibly could; and having appointed him Time and Place for a Rendezvous, he went thither, where for a long time he expected the Marquess <HI>de Genlis,</HI> without seeing him come. As there needed no great matter to make him swear, he took occasion from thence to take into his mouth he Name of GOD, of whom he did
<PB N="78" REF="42"/> not often otherwise speak; he an hundred times reviled the Marquess <HI>de Genlis,</HI> threatning aloud to ruine him at Court; and not daring to accuse him of Cowardise, because there were many Persons who would have secretly given him the Lie, he accused him of holding Intelligence with the Enemy, but in covert and un∣certain Words, whereunto no-body would answer, because they well saw from what Spirit this proceeded. In fine, when he had vented his Choler in abundance of Injuries and Blasphe∣mies, he assembled a little Council of War, composed of the Count <HI>de Saux,</HI> the Marquess de <HI>Castelnau,</HI> the Count <HI>de Milly,</HI> the Cadet <HI>Scoupe,</HI> and <HI>Mom∣bas:</HI> This, as being capable to be the Geographer of the Country, wherein he had lived above twenty Years; those, as Persons fit not on∣ly to give Counsel, but also to exe∣cute the Counsel they should have gi∣ven. There it was proposed what was to be done; whether it were more expedient to pass on further, or to retire, whereunto the Duke of
<PB N="79" REF="42"/> <HI>Luxemburg</HI> seemed to incline, because <HI>Genlis</HI> had failed of his Word. As this Council was wholly composed of young Men, except <HI>Mombas,</HI> they were all of opinion to go on, and <HI>Mombas</HI> conformed himself to their Sentiment, because that he would have been alone of his own. Whilst these things were doing, the Count <HI>de la Mark,</HI> Camp-Master of the Regi∣ment of <HI>Picardy,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Wordes,</HI> dispatch'd a Man to the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> with Letters, whereby he informed him, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had already raised two Forts at the Head of the Inun∣dation, whereof the one was guard∣ed by the Count <HI>de Horne,</HI> General of the Artillery; and the other by <HI>Zuilestein,</HI> General of the Foot: And since the Succour must arrive by one of these two ways, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> ask'd <HI>Mombas,</HI> With which he thought it would be best dealing, whether with the Count <HI>de Horne,</HI> or <HI>Zuilestein? Mombas,</HI> glad that he could speak, which did not very often befall him, told the Duke of <HI>Luxem∣burg,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="43"/> that it was his Advice to attack <HI>Zuilestein,</HI> because he would some∣times drink hard, and did not stand so much upon his Guard as the Count <HI>de Horne</HI> might, who did not sleep, but was always upon the Watch.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> having resolved to follow this Counsel, not that he grounded himself upon what <HI>Mombas</HI> had told him, but because it was indifferent to him to attack <HI>Horne</HI> or <HI>Zuilestein,</HI> march'd his Troops up∣on the Causey which goes from <HI>Ʋ∣trecht</HI> to <HI>Wordes,</HI> having the Canal of <HI>Wordes</HI> on the one hand, and the Meadows on the other, but which wholly resembled a Sea, because they had already for some time been all under Water. When he was about half a League from the Enemy, he made an halt to send to view the Place, before he engaged any farther. Every one expected, that <HI>Mombas</HI> would ask to go thither, as well to give Marks of his Courage, as to shew his Zeal to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg:</HI> but whether he feared that he would not put confidence enough in him,
<PB N="81" REF="43"/> to refer himself to what he should say; or whether he were not willing to en∣gage himself as a private Souldier, he let this Employ be taken by two Ser∣geants, who were named by the Count <HI>de Saux,</HI> and for whose Bra∣very and Fidelity he answered to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg.</HI></P>
<P>These Souldiers by favour of the Night advanced within Musket-shot of the Fort of <HI>Zuilestein;</HI> but well knowing that unless they got farther, they could not give any certain Ac∣count of what was desired to be known, they cast themselves into the Inundation, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and making the least Noise they possibly could, for fear of being discover'd they re∣mark'd that there was a Mill before the Fort, where they had some Re∣trenchments, and had put some Pali∣zadoes; that in the Inundation there was an House, wherein they had placed some Musquetiers, which flank∣ed the Fort, that when the Enemies should go to the Attack, they might thence kill them many Men: In fine,
<PB N="82" REF="44"/> that the Fort was of Earth, but well palizadoed with a Ditch before, and Cannon; so that tho they had not much time to put it in condition, there was appearance nevertheless that they would make good resistance.</P>
<P>After the two Sergeants had rela∣ted what I have just now told you, Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> foreseeing that they would kill him many Men from the House, which was in the midst of the Inundation, resolv'd to cause it to be attack'd, and also went thither himself to animate the Souldiers by his Presence. In the mean time he made a Detachment to march against the Mill, and having appointed Men to support it, he commanded those that were near him to go into the In∣undation, to shew the way to the Troops. <HI>Mombas</HI> being one of the first that entred into it, had not gone above five or six steps, when he called out to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> that there was not much Water, and that he might securely come in. Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> believed him, but having a moment after made a false Step,
<PB N="83" REF="44"/> every one began to cry out that <HI>Mombas</HI> was a Traitor; and that af∣ter he had betrayed the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> amongst whom he durst no longer shew his Head, he endeavoured to regain their Favour, by destroying the Troops of <HI>France</HI> with their Ge∣neral. To these Reproaches were added Threats, and to the Threats also some Blows; so that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> not being able to re∣move this Impression out of their Minds, which were strongly seized therewith, gave command to <HI>Mom∣bas</HI> to retire near him; but as he would not entirely ruine his Honour, he took a Pretext of sending him to carry Orders to the Troops which marched against the Mill: after which he continued his way under a∣nother Guide.</P>
<P>The Minds of the Souldiers being by this means quieted, every one continued to march in the Rank wherein he had been put; and the House being attack'd at the same time with the Mill, those that were within, were hindred from thinking
<PB N="84" REF="45"/> to take the Enemy in the Flank, to provide for their own Defence. The Resistance was great both in the Mill and in the Fort; but the <HI>French</HI> ha∣ving attack'd them so much the more vigorously, took both the one and the other, and set them on fire, to the end, as I believe, they might have the pleasure of hearing it said, that they had not only surmounted the Waters by their Courage, but tri∣umphed also over that Element by a contrary. However it were, it was notwithstanding a thing which cost them dear: for <HI>Zuilestein</HI>'s Men, who had till that time shot at random, having then the Flame which served them for a Guide, scarce made any Shot afterwards which had not effect, especially the Cannoniers, who hence∣forward charged only with Cart∣ridges. This began to put the Ene∣my in great disorder, and in fine, it was to be believed, that they would not only have been rebutted thereby, but also forced to betake themselves to flight, had not Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> come to reassure them; he put him∣self
<PB N="85" REF="45"/> at their Head, and having en∣couraged them by his Example, every one observed him as if nothing had happened. <HI>Milly,</HI> who had the Vant-Guard, with the Regiment of <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> whereof he was Colonel, cast himself into the Retrenchments of <HI>Zuilestein</HI> with abundance of Cou∣rage; but as he endeavoured to break a Palizado, that he might get farther, he received a Shot in the Thigh, whereof he died a short time after. The Misfortune of <HI>Milly</HI> did not at all astonish those that were commanded to second him; but ha∣ving broken the Palizadoes, they took the Fort by Assault, in the defence whereof <HI>Zuilestein</HI> lost his Life, after he had done all that could be expected from a gallant Man. <HI>Mom∣bas</HI> would vaunt that it was he who kill'd him, because he believ'd what passed during the Night could not have been observed; but the Count <HI>de Saux,</HI> who had to do with him, testified, that it was a Sergeant of his Regiment to whom also he held himself obliged, not knowing what
<PB N="86" REF="46"/> Issue he should have had of that Af∣fair, if he had not come to his Assist∣ance.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Wordes</HI> relieved with much reputation to Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> but with little satisfaction to abun∣dance of Officers, who signalized themselves there, and amongst others to the Count <HI>de Milly:</HI> For the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> having forgotten, whe∣ther through Design or Chance, to speak of him in the particular Ac∣count he sent to the King. <HI>Milly</HI> was so discontented thereat, that his Wound, which was already but too dangerous, grew daily worse and worse; he told all those that came to see him, that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> had ruined his Honour for his whole Life; and that his Life being thus a Burthen to him, the most favourable thing that could befall him was to die quickly. The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> ha∣ving knowledg of these things by some-body that sent him word there∣of, writ at the same time to <HI>Milly,</HI> for whom he had a great esteem, That he was to blame, to lay so much
<PB N="87" REF="46"/> to heart a thing which the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> had done without design; that all <HI>France</HI> was persuaded of his Gallantry; and that he was himself ready to render account thereof to the whole World, as having often seen him manifest it upon occasions. <HI>Milly</HI> read this Letter with incredible Joy, told every one that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had restored him his Honour, and thrusting it between his two Night-caps, suffered it not to be ta∣ken from him, till he had given up the Ghost.</P>
<P>I had moreover forgotten to men∣tion a thing which happened at the Relief of <HI>Wordes,</HI> and which shews how little distance there is sometimes between Victory and Defeat. After the taking of the Fort of <HI>Zuilestein,</HI> there was a certain Report spread a∣mong the <HI>French,</HI> that there was yet another Fort between <HI>Wordes</HI> and the Army; and there appeared so great a Consternation thereat amongst the Souldiers, that every one demanded rather to return than to go any far∣ther. The Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> him∣self,
<PB N="88" REF="47"/> not over-well knowing what he had to do, consulted the principal Officers of his Army; and they ha∣ving declared to him that nothing was to be precipitated, before they were sure of what they apprehended, made him resolve to send to know the Truth. The Duke of <HI>Luxem∣burg</HI> chose for this purpose a Person that I could easily name if I would, in whom he had very great confidence, but who nevertheless answered not what every one expected of him; for having met in the way with <HI>la Palme,</HI> Lieutenant-Colonel of the <HI>Holland</HI>-Regiment of the Marine, whom the Count <HI>de Horne</HI> sent to as∣sist <HI>Zuilestein,</HI> not yet knowing that he had lost both his Fort and his Life, he cowardly turned back, and came to tell the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> that all that had been told him was true, that there was yet another Fort, and that he could not arrive at <HI>Wordes,</HI> without taking that first. One can∣not imagine the Terror that he struck into the Troops by this News, which so well confirmed what they already
<PB N="89" REF="47"/> apprehended. The Duke of <HI>Luxem∣burg</HI> thereupon assembled the Coun∣cil of War, and every one was of opinion to hazard nothing more, whereon the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> him∣self concluded, well knowing that he could lay all the Fault upon the Mar∣quess de <HI>Genlis,</HI> for not keeping his Word with him. But as they were upon the point to execute this Reso∣lution, two Horsemen, whom the Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> had detached to know what hindred the Succour from entring the Town, arrived from <HI>Wordes,</HI> and quieted their Minds, by the assurance they gave them, that this new Fort was but a Castle in the Air. Every one after this no longer doubting, they began to speak ill of him that had been sent to search into it; but he having the Protection of Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg,</HI> this pass'd not the Camp, and the General took no care to give the Court advice thereof, which would have caused this Officer to be cashier'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> dealt not in the same manner with Mr. <HI>de Genlis,</HI> who
<PB N="90" REF="48"/> was exiled; but as he excused him∣self upon the Impossibility of getting his Troops together in so short a time as Mr. <HI>de Luxemburg</HI> had assigned him, his Exile lasted not long, and he served again soon after as if no∣thing had been.</P>
<P>But let us pass over in silence so many other Evenements, wherein Fortune was sometimes favourable, and sometimes contrary to the <HI>French,</HI> let us say only, That their Conduct was so pitiful, that altho they entred into the Field with an Army of above Sixscore Thousand Men, and had not lost above Two Thousand of them, their Forces were nevertheless so separated by reason of their gree∣diness to keep their Conquests, that this opened the way to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to reconquer their Country, were they but never so little assisted by their Neighbours.</P>
<P>Amongst those that animated them to do something that might be glori∣ous, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> shewed them∣selves most affectionate, not only through the Antipathy they naturally
<PB N="91" REF="48"/> have against the <HI>French,</HI> but also through the Insults they daily recei∣ved from them: For their Armies encamped indifferently upon the Ter∣ritories of <HI>Spain,</HI> and those of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> their Commanders not being concerned at their giving occa∣sion of Complaint to a Nation, which they esteemed feeble, and not in con∣dition to resent it. The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who by the Death of <HI>de VVitt,</HI> sacrificed by the People, that imputed to him all the Misfortunes which were come upon the State, had been elevated to a supreme Gran∣dure, sought nothing on his side, but to keep up by some great Action the Esteem the People had conceived of his Person. For this purpose he press'd the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> Go∣vernor of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> to declare himself; but he still re∣coiled back, whether he was distrust∣ful of the Success, or rather because they could not agree together on what side to turn their Arms, each of them desiring that it should be on that side which was favourable to
<PB N="92" REF="49"/> themselves. In the mean while, since it was of consequence not to lose Time, which is never recovered, and especially in War, where there needs but one only moment to change all, they agreed at the last to attack <HI>Char∣leroy,</HI> which was advantagious both to the one and the other: because that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by that means delivered themselves from a Place, which gives the <HI>French</HI> entrance into their Country; the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> on their side, secured their Frontiers, which could not be attack'd, if they once made themselves Masters of that Place, because it was there that the Enemies made all their Magazines, and assembled all their Convoys. Thereby also they might hope, that they should not only thenceforward have more facility to make War, but also that the <HI>French</HI> would be ob∣liged to abandon their Conquests, be∣cause that not having any longer the means to lay Siege to <HI>Maestricht,</HI> without which they could not proba∣bly hope to make so many Places sub∣sist, all these Places would be lost of
<PB N="93" REF="49"/> themselves, the Country not being sufficient to furnish them with Ne∣cessaries.</P>
<P>Things being with so much pru∣dence, as it seemed, concerted, there remained nothing more but to exe∣cute them with discretion, which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> did on his side; but there was much to be said, that he was not seconded by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as he ought, and they had promised him. Nevertheless, for his own part, after he had spread a Report in his Army, that he would go to <HI>Tongres,</HI> and <HI>Maseik,</HI> for to disingage <HI>Mae∣stricht,</HI> which was block'd up by the means of these two Places above and below the <HI>Meuse,</HI> (for tho <HI>Tongres</HI> be not upon this River, yet since it is not far from it, it wrought the same Effect as if it had been thereon) he obliged <HI>Montal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> to put himself into <HI>Ton∣gres,</HI> after which he marched against <HI>Charleroy,</HI> which was destitute of the presence of its Governor, and where∣in besides there was but a very weak Garrison.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="50"/>
<P>The Surprize of <HI>France</HI> was extra∣ordinary at this Rencounter. This seemed to her not to be the Essay of a young Prince, who could not yet have much Experience, but on the contrary, the Master-Stroke of a Captain grown perfect in the Trade. In the mean time, as the Loss of this Place would draw with it strange Consequences for her, besides that she gave Order to all the Garrisons thereabout to march speedily to its Relief, all the Gallants of the Court took Post to have their part in the Glory. But there was no need for their making so much haste, all the Success of the Affair could consist on∣ly in an extraordinay Diligence, which should have obliged the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> that were upon the Place, to have had all things ready for the Siege. But as they are naturally slow, the Cannon arrived not till two days after the Place was invested; so that having thereby given time to the Troops to draw together, and to <HI>Montal</HI> to get into the Town, they were forced to raise the Siege, and
<PB N="95" REF="50"/> to carry away as much Shame from this Enterprize, as there was Honour to be gotten by it.</P>
<P>From this time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> saw how little ground there was to build any thing upon the Word of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have since conti∣nued to do always the same thing: For do we not know, that in all the Fights wherein they have been found, they rather brought Disorder than Succour? Were they not found at the Battel of <HI>Senef,</HI> pillaging the Baggage of their Allies? and were they not obliged to hang a very suffi∣cient Number of them to give Exam∣ple unto others? But that wherein their Weakness wholly appeared, was in the Excuses they made to <HI>France,</HI> immediately after the unhap∣py Success of the Siege of <HI>Charleroy;</HI> for the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> not only disavowed the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> but offered also to recall him from his Government, for to appease <HI>France,</HI> which made a great Noise for his ha∣ving thus dared to take Arms. In the mean time, they would not have the
<PB N="96" REF="51"/> <HI>Spaniards</HI> think of repelling Force by Force, which it was nevertheless to little purpose for them to do, there being such a Malediction upon them, that they seem to bring Misfortune upon those that take their part.</P>
<P>In the time that all this pass'd, Mr. <HI>de Brandenburg</HI> was at the Head of his Army, five and twenty thou∣sand strong, always expecting that the Emperor would bring his into the Field, which was held for most certain, after he had so solemnly ta∣ken the Resolution to do it in the Pilgrimage of <HI>Marienzel:</HI> But he was very much surprized to under∣stand that this Prince had changed his Sentiment, being prevented by the strong Alarms given by the Je∣suits, who had, as I have already said, but too much power over his Mind. This then obliged the Mar∣quess of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> on his side to think of making his Accommoda∣tion with <HI>France,</HI> whose Forces were superior to his. He could not pro∣bably flatter himself with the hopes of an happy Success, when those who
<PB N="97" REF="51"/> had most powerfully excited him to take Arms, thus turned their back upon him: for altho he had been at first sollicited thereunto by the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> the House of <HI>Austria</HI> in such manner joined her self to their Solll∣citations, that one would have said, that her own Interests were more con∣cerned therein than the Interest of her Neighbours. Which, in the mean time, afforded great matter of Admi∣ration to those who made reflection on past and present things; for they were wholly astonished to see, that a Nation which had so far hated ano∣ther, as several times to have caused the Heads thereof to be assassinated, should be so much changed, that she should her self go to seek Assistance in the Courts of Princes, for those whom she had by all manner of ways endeavoured to oppress. But if they had occasion to be at that time asto∣nished, they would have much more to be so now, in seeing what at pre∣sent passes: For if we will make but never so little Reflection on the Con∣duct of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is it not an
<PB N="98" REF="52"/> amazing thing, that they should be obliged at this day to have recourse to the same <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to whom they had so often served for Executioners; and that after having so many times in vain endeavoured to exterminate them, they should at present be con∣strained to acknowledg, that they subsist only by their Succour? In ef∣fect, there is not any one so blind, as not to see that it is the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to whom the Safety of <HI>Flanders</HI> is at this day due, and that, were it not for them, the <HI>French</HI> had long since made themselves Masters thereof.</P>
<P>The Accommodation of the Mar∣quess of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> with <HI>France</HI> was none of the most difficult to make: For since <HI>France</HI> demanded nothing, but that none should concern them∣selves with the Affairs of the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> she gave order to Mr. <HI>de Tu∣renne,</HI> who lay a little hard upon <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> to leave him in repose, on condition, as he offered, to conti∣nue Neuter during the War, provi∣ded the Places were restored to him, which <HI>France</HI> held from him in the
<PB N="99" REF="52"/> Dutchy of <HI>Cleves,</HI> as <HI>Wesel,</HI> and some other Places of less importance. This Accommodation being made upon these Conditions, Mr. <HI>de Brandenburg</HI> retired into his own Dominions, and Mr. <HI>de Turenne</HI> on this side the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>It thereby seemed that all sort of Succour was forbid the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But as it often happens, that Things produce Effects wholly contrary to those for which they were done; so it happened, that what should have hast∣ned the Ruine of the <HI>Ʋnited Provin∣ces,</HI> was what hastened their Preser∣vation: For <HI>France,</HI> to secure her self for the future from such like Enterprizes, no longer kept any measure with any Prince of the Em∣pire. She seized upon <HI>Treves</HI> and <HI>Bonn;</HI> and tho the Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> seemed to consent to the Invasion of the last Place, it was nevertheless known that he was forced thereunto; and that if the Bishop of <HI>Strasburg</HI> had not had so much power over him, he had perhaps taken Resolutions more worthy his Birth, and more
<PB N="100" REF="53"/> conformable to his Interests. How∣ever it were, all the Princes of the Empire excited one another no longer to suffer <HI>France</HI> to encroach upon their Liberty. Only Madamoiselle <HI>de Savoy,</HI> of whom I have spoken before, who was married to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> having a great Influence over the Spirit of her Husband, and withal remembring the Amity which the <HI>French</HI> King had heretofore testi∣fied to her, was very glad to shew him some Marks of her Acknowledg∣ment upon this occasion; for she hin∣dred <HI>Bavaria</HI> from entring into the League which was forming against <HI>France,</HI> on condition nevertheless that the Dauphin should marry her Daughter.</P>
<P>This League made the Affairs of the <HI>French</HI> change their Face. The Emperor, press'd by so many Prin∣ces, made himself Head of this League. And as <HI>Brandenburg</HI> had not made his Treaty, but that he saw himself abandoned by every Body; so he no sooner saw that all the rest entred into the Lists against <HI>France,</HI> but he
<PB N="101" REF="53"/> himself resolved also to make one a∣mongst them.</P>
<P>One of the first Objects of this League's Arms was the Siege of <HI>Bonne,</HI> by the Conquest whereof not only <HI>Germany</HI> was delivered from French Slavery, but also the Towns which that Crown had the foregoing Cam∣paign gotten from the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> For as they received thereby both Ammunition and Victuals, which they could not have by the <HI>Meuse,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> held <HI>Charlemont</HI> and <HI>Namur,</HI> they were forced to think of abandoning them, and that before the Army of the Allies, which was numerous, should seize on the Passages, and thereby hinder the re∣turn of the Garrisons. Mr. <HI>de Lux∣emburg,</HI> who was the farthest in the Country, where he had signalized himself by unheard of Cruelties, es∣pecially at the taking of <HI>Suammerdam</HI> and <HI>Bodegrave,</HI> was the first who re∣ceived Orders to retire. He speedily obeyed them, well knowing, that being so hated of the People as he was, it would not be secure for him
<PB N="102" REF="54"/> to stay there, if Fortune were once contrary to <HI>France.</HI> But the Marescal <HI>de Bellefonds,</HI> having shewn himself a little more stiff, because he thought this Command not conformable to the King's Interests, deserv'd to be exiled for offering to penetrate far∣ther into the matter than they would have him.</P>
<P>These happy Successes were ballan∣ced by the Loss which the Allies made of the Town of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and of <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> a Province appertain∣ing to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were also entred into the League, but had not made it much stronger thereby: for they had neither Forces nor Disci∣pline, and yet their Vanity went so far, as to desire to be esteemed the Soul of the Party; but if it had been so, it would have been a Party, whose Soul was upon its Lips just rea∣dy to depart.</P>
<P>I will not, as I have already said, relate all the different Successes of the War: for besides that it would be to engage my self in a Labour which I should never get out of with honour,
<PB N="103" REF="54"/> for the Reasons I have before alledg∣ed, what use would it be of to this Work, the Aim whereof is only to shew the Enterprizes and Insincerity of <HI>France,</HI> since her aspiring to the Universal Monarchy? I shall say nevertheless by the way, That if she had more Felicity than Infelicity, during the course of this War, it was because our Union was an ill-united Union, every Prince minding his own particular Interests, and little caring for the common Interest.</P>
<P>In effect, would they have believed the deceased Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was without doubt a great Captain, tho unfortunate, they would neither have lost <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> nor have had all the Misfortunes which attend it: For instead of going to make War in <HI>Alsatia,</HI> as they did, they should have gone strait into <HI>Lorrain,</HI> where all the Gentry attended him, ready to take Horse for his Service, have pass'd from thence to <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> established there the Seat of the War, and carried the Terror of their Arms into the Heart of <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="55"/> where they might have made Inroads when they would. Thereby they would have obliged the Enemies to keep a great Army in the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and they would have fed upon themselves, whereas they ate up the Allies, who were obliged, as we say, to lay the Cloth for them, the Emperor by his Authority causing the War to be carried into <HI>Alsatia;</HI> for through the same Reasons per∣haps, which are easily guess'd, and not necessary to be here related, that inclined the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to de∣sire that the War should be made in his Country, the Emperor desired they should conquer <HI>Alsatia,</HI> which was a Fief of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> that had been yielded to <HI>France</HI> by the Peace of <HI>Munster.</HI> However it were, Experience shewed, that what∣ever prospect the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> might have therein, he still reasoned like a great Captain; whereas the Emperor reasoned neither like a Cap∣tain nor Politician: For at least, when he carried the War on another side, he ought to have assured him∣self
<PB N="105" REF="55"/> how he might succour <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> in case it should be attack'd; but he had so little provided for it, that when the French Army was en∣tred thereinto, he began to negotiate with the <HI>Suisses,</HI> to move whom em∣ploying only Words, instead of o∣ther Means to which they are known to yield, they would never open the Passages, shewing therein as much Brutishness, if I may be permitted to say fo, as Interest.</P>
<P>The Loss of this fair Province drew after it very pernicious Conse∣quences: For the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who saw that he had thereby lost all hopes of ever re-entring into his Country, entirely detached himself from the Party, I mean as to his In∣clination, for to outward appearance he continued still with them, not knowing perhaps whither to go for to be better: And certainly I shall hereupon relate things, which every one perhaps doth not so well know as my self. In effect, there are many who know not, that after the taking of <HI>Franche Comté,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="56"/> sent to the French Court a Gen∣tleman, who had been heretofore his Page, named, as I take it, <HI>Cevillette,</HI> to offer to abandon the Party, if they would permit him to retire either into <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Lorrain,</HI> during the War, give him Appointments suitable to a Prince of his Birth, and put him into possession of his Country at the making of the Peace, on the Condi∣tions that had been proposed long before the War, whereof it would be superfluous to speak here, because this regards not my purpose.</P>
<P>Now tho all these Conditions did not any way please <HI>France,</HI> she cea∣sed not to hearken to the secret En∣voy of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> as if she had an Inclination to favour his Master; she answered him, That she was glad to see that he was re-entred into his true Interests, but that, for certain Considerations, it was impos∣sible for her at present to hearken to his Offers: First, because she had a care of his Honour, which those that envied him would not fail to blemish, if in the height of the War,
<PB N="107" REF="56"/> as it then was, he alone should stand still, and look on what pass'd in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> Nevertheless, if his Intention were really to attach himself to <HI>France,</HI> he should begin to withdraw his Son, the Duke of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> out of the hands of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> after which they would soon agree upon the Pensions he demanded, and up∣on an Equivalent for the Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> or upon Conditions to re∣store him to his States. Now they would not wholly break with him, by rejecting his Propositions, which were altogether ridiculous, conside∣ring the State wherein things then were; nor yet entirely rebut him: for by rebutting him, they should make him an irreconcileable Enemy, which was not agreeable to Policy, because they knew not in what man∣ner things might turn. And by ac∣commodating with him, they would have done themselves a notable Preju∣dice, for many reasons: First, be∣cause if he was once retired into <HI>France,</HI> he was a Spirit capable to excite the People to Sedition, and
<PB N="108" REF="57"/> put himself at their Head, which was more to be feared by the Court, than whatever else could befall them. Se∣condly, Because they pretended to hold commerce with him, and by that means discover all that pass'd in the Army of the Allies. And in fine, because being suspected, as he already was, by his own Party, where he thought nothing well done, especially since the Loss of <HI>Franche Comte,</HI> he created there Distrusts and Jealousies amongst the Princes, to whom he did not cease to remonstrate, that the War was not made for them, but for the Emperor; that he spake not for his own Interest, altho what was be∣fallen him, was sufficient enough to render them wise at his Costs; but let them consider only in what man∣ner the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> was treated, who thinking to remove the War from his Country, had quitted the Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> for to enter in∣to their Union; that he was eaten up by the one and the other, persecuted by the Garrison of <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> with∣out having been able thitherto to
<PB N="109" REF="57"/> oblige the Emperor to lay Siege un∣to it, altho it were one of the Con∣ditions of his Treaty, and that be∣cause the Emperor was by the same Treaty obliged to restore that Place to the Bishop of <HI>Spire,</HI> to whom it be∣longed before the <HI>French</HI> got it; that as much hangs over their Heads, if, as the Emperor acted only for his own Interests, they did not also on their side mind their own Affairs; that in all respects a good Peace was much better than a War, all the Pro∣fit whereof ought to fall upon one alone, and all the Loss upon others.</P>
<P>As <HI>France</HI> therefore well knew what his Discontent was capable to produce, she would not conclude any thing with him, but entertained him however with fair hopes. Some time after arrived the Affair of <HI>Treves,</HI> I mean the routing of the Mareschal <HI>de Crequi,</HI> which raised the Affairs of the Confederates to so high a pitch, that they seemed as if they were a∣bout to penetrate even into the Heart of <HI>France.</HI> But he that had caused the Evil, soon brought the Remedy,
<PB N="110" REF="58"/> I mean the Duke of <HI>Lorrain:</HI> For after he had gained the Battel, and said before every Body, that it was now that he would go as far as <HI>Paris,</HI> a secret Interposer from <HI>France,</HI> who resided in <HI>Treves,</HI> that he might up∣on occasion be near him, being intro∣duced unto him by <HI>Cevillette,</HI> who was but just delivered out of the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> with whom he had been Prisoner, whether by chance or upon design, beat down all these fair Resolutions with Bills of Exchange for two hundred thousand Crowns, which were paid at <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and which the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> left in the hands of a Merchant, because he was not of that humour as not to make advantage of his Money. And this it was that made Mr. <HI>de Louvois</HI> speak so boldly in the presence of all the Court, that if the Confederates had gained a great Victory, they should not draw thence so much Pro∣fit as was pretended, because instead of advancing into <HI>France,</HI> they would return to the Siege of <HI>Treves,</HI> and
<PB N="111" REF="58"/> thence into their Quarters. In ef∣fect, this was the Pretext that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> took, saying, That it was no point of good Sence to en∣gage themselves so far into a Coun∣try, and leave behind them so good Places; that the Scope of their Uni∣on was only to deliver <HI>Germany</HI> from Slavery, which they could no way better do, than by driving the <HI>French</HI> out of a Town, which was not only considerable for its Scituation, but also for being the ordinary Abode of one of the first Electors of the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>The News that came a day or two after, that the Mareschal <HI>de Crequi</HI> was got into <HI>Treves,</HI> finished the gi∣ving a colour to his Designs. He re∣monstrated to those who were not of his Opinion, that the Presence of such a Man was not to be contemned, who besides that he perfectly knew the Trade of War; was also anima∣ted by the Despair of what had be∣fallen him. In effect, he fought as a true Desperado; and if a Captain of Foot, named <HI>Boisjourdan,</HI> had not
<PB N="112" REF="59"/> treated secretly with the Besiegers, to put the Place into their hands, upon certain Conditions whereunto many others also consented, either this Mareschal would have been slain up∣on the Breach, or he would have shewn whereof a brave Man is capa∣ble, when animated by a great De∣spair. But as he was upon the Ram∣part, exciting every one to do his Devoir, <HI>Boisjourdan</HI> had the insolence to tell him, That it was in vain for him to animate them to a Defence, more rash than reasonable; that eve∣ry one knew what made him act, that it was the Despair of having been beaten; but that, since they were no cause thereof, it was for him to draw himself out of it as he could, without enveloping them in his Mis∣fortune; that the Town was of it self nothing worth; that the Walls were besides beaten down by the Can∣non, the Enemy lodged even in the Ditch, and in fine, every thing rea∣dy to take it by Assault, if they had not remedied it in Time and Place; that since they well believed, that for
<PB N="113" REF="59"/> the Reasons he had touched upon, he would never hear speak of Composi∣tion, they had taken care to do it without him, and that he had it in his Pocket; that it was his part then to conform to a thing, which, beside that it was already done, was also done with reason.</P>
<P>Never perhaps has such another Affair been heard of. It was indeed very extraordinary to see, that a simple Captain of Foot had thus treated of the Surrendry of a Place, to the prejudice of a Mareschal of <HI>France</HI> who was therein, and so many other Officers his Superiors. The Mareschal <HI>de Crequi</HI> also, finding himself so much the more moved, as the thing appeared to him new, put his hand to his Sword at the begin∣ning of his Discourse, and as he was going to kill him, a Souldier who stood Sentinel stopt him, by offering to fire upon him. This caused the Mareschal <HI>de Creqni</HI> to leave <HI>Bois∣jourdan,</HI> and pass his Sword through the Body of the Souldier; which done, he ran again after <HI>Boisjourdan,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="60"/> who seeing that he had to deal with so rude a Gamester, leapt through the Breach into the Ditch, thinking to save himself among the Imperia∣lists; by whom being despised, as a Man unworthy, after what he had done, to keep company with honest Persons, he would have pass'd into the furthest parts of <HI>Germany:</HI> But being discovered, as I take it, at <HI>Thionville,</HI> he was conducted from thence to <HI>Mets,</HI> where by Sentence of the Council of War he had his Head struck off, a very gentle Punish∣ment for so great a Crime as his.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Enemy, who was at the Gates, failed not to take hold of so favourable an Opportunity to make themselves Masters of the Town. They entred immediately, and the Mareschal <HI>de Crequi</HI> had scarce time to save himself in the Church, which was good enough, and where he pretended to make yet some resistance. They summoned him there to sign the Composition which <HI>Boisjourdan</HI> had made; for the Confederates would keep to it, wherefore they
<PB N="115" REF="60"/> had given Order that there should no Injury be done either to the Garri∣son, or Inhabitants. But the Mare∣schal, not willing that so shameful an Affair should be hereafter imputed to him, refused to do it, but in the mean time agreed with <HI>Saveuse,</HI> Co∣lonel of Horse, who had escaped with him after the Defeat, and had since followed his Fortune, that he should sign the Capitulation, to the end that having his Liberty, he might go to Court, to give an account of his Actions; for he was in great dis∣quiet, how they would receive there what had since this little while befal∣len him. <HI>Saveuse,</HI> who was intirely devoted to the Mareschal, failed not to execute his Orders, whilst he on his side endeavoured to obtain an honest Composition; but since the Post where he was, was not tenable, he was obliged to yield upon Dis∣cretion.</P>
<P>These happy Evenements for the Confederates, with what befell them also advantagious in <HI>Catalonia</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> had been defeated in open
<PB N="116" REF="61"/> Field, after they had given a Battel without Order and Discipline, ought to have been followed with many o∣ther great Successes; if the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who, as I have already said, was prepossest with Jealousy, had not also prepossest. others therewith. Thus instead of drawing thence the Advantage which they might have probably hoped for, they had the vexation to see that all this turned to Smoke; whereas the Enemy, dex∣trously profiting by our Discords, made every day new Conquests, the Loss whereof in the mean time fell al∣ways upon <HI>Spain,</HI> because it was on that side that they made their princi∣pal Enterprizes.</P>
<P>But to finish the beating down of this Crown, the Town of <HI>Messina,</HI> chief of the Realm of <HI>Sicily,</HI> revol∣ted against it, induced thereto by the terrible Exactions of their Viceroys, whose Friends had always hindred the Complaints that People made a∣gainst them from coming to the Ears of the Sovereign; for in fine, it is a Custom established amongst the
<PB N="117" REF="61"/> Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> to support one a∣nother; so that whatever becomes thereby of the Preservation of the State, it is all considered as nothing at what time their Interest comes in competition with it. And this it is which makes that Crown, altho it possess so many rich States and Coun∣tries of great Extent, to be at this day nevertheless poorer than a little Prince, who should not possess above the hundredth part of what it pos∣sesseth. In effect, without going any farther, what is <HI>Holland,</HI> in compari∣son of all <HI>Spain,</HI> of the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples, Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> the State of <HI>Milan,</HI> and so many others, that I should never have done if I would specify them all? In the mean time, what doth not <HI>Holland</HI> at this time do? And is it not she that might at this day save all <HI>Europe,</HI> if she would unanimously employ all her Forces? But to return to <HI>Messina;</HI> the Revolt thereof not only drew a new War on that side, through the Protection which <HI>France</HI> gave that Town, but also put a great deal of Disorder in
<PB N="118" REF="62"/> the Affairs of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were obliged hastily to withdraw their Troops from <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and send them into <HI>Italy.</HI> By this means the <HI>French</HI> finding themselves Masters in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> retook <HI>Bellegarde</HI> which they had lost, pillaged all the Coun∣try from the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains e∣ven beyond <HI>Gironne;</HI> and had they had a design of making themselves Masters thereof, as well as of many other Places, there is a great appear∣ance that nothing could have hindred them: But not being willing to esta∣blish themselves beyond these high Mountains, which Nature seems to have put for a Separation between the two Realms, they contented themselves with the Prey they had got, and let the People feather them∣selves every Winter, to the end they might plume them every Spring.</P>
<P>Altho the War of <HI>Messina</HI> was of very great consequence, yet should I not cross the Seas to seek a Subject for this Work, were it not that I shall at the same time find a fair mat∣ter to prove the Unfaithfulness of the
<PB N="119" REF="62"/> <HI>French.</HI> They sent thither at first the Marquess <HI>de Vallavoir,</HI> a Gentle∣man of <HI>Provence,</HI> not in quality of a Viceroy, but with a Command equal thereunto, so that he wanted nothing but the Name. He behaved himself in this Charge, during the space of eighteen Months, or thereabouts, with great satisfaction to the People, to whom he caused at his Arrival to be delivered <HI>gratis</HI> a quantity of Corn, which had been brought from <HI>France,</HI> and whereof the <HI>Messineses</HI> could ne∣ver have more need; for they had already a long time eaten Horses, Rats, Mice, and other unclean Ani∣mals, their best Repasts being only of these sorts of things, with a few ill-tasted Herbs when they could get them. But at the end of that time, <HI>Vallavoir</HI> having had a Difference with the Intendant, because they would both rob without sharing one with another, was revoked, and the Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> sent in his place, who brought into that Country a greater Name, but a less Sufficiency. He came thither with the quality of
<PB N="120" REF="63"/> a Viceroy, which so much the more pleased the People, as they believed that this would oblige <HI>France</HI> to do something more than she had hither∣to done, to disengage so considerable a Town, which was still so closely block'd up, that it received no other Succour to live upon, but what came to it from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the Duke was in the Town, he put all his Authority into the hands of his Secretary, took care to make provision of all sorts of good Wines, enquired where were the fairest Courtizans, caused a Chair to be made, wherein he might sleep com∣modiously as he was carried along; and in fine, forgot nothing whereby he might keep himself as portly as when he came thither. At the be∣ginning, when he pass'd along the Streets, every one extolled his Civi∣lity, because they observed him from time to time to bow down and lift up his Head, like a Man that would salute some-body; but at last, a Person having observed that it was because he slept, and having shewn it
<PB N="121" REF="63"/> to others, there was no more such pressing to see him pass along the way, which was very commodious for him, because he was not very de∣sirous that it should be always known whither he went.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Refreshments which <HI>Messina</HI> from time to time re∣ceived from <HI>France,</HI> it is impossible to say to what misery it was reduced. There needed no more but to give Bread, to have the richest Goods in the Town. Husbands there prostituted their Wives, Fathers their Daughters, Bro∣thers their Sisters; and there was not so much as the Superiors of Nunne∣ries, but endeavoured to subsist by the Intrigue of some handsom religious Woman. But the Hatred which the Inhabitants had conceived of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> was so strongly imprinted in their Mind, that all languishing and dying as they were, they chose rather their Miseries, than to return under their Dominion. They let them∣selves then be amused by the frivo∣lous hope, which the Viceroy from time to time gave them, that he would
<PB N="122" REF="64"/> soon go open the Passages; but they were other Passages that he thought on, which had in the mean time so ill treated him, that they had brought him to his Litter.</P>
<P>The Officers, according to the Example of their Chief, led not a more glorious Life. The Chevalier Duke, General of the Horse, made good provision of these sorts of Pas∣sages; and tho he were above five and fifty years old, yet must he have no less than four, so much fear had he of wanting. For the Commander of the Foot, as he brought with him out of <HI>France</HI> not a Preservative a∣gainst all sorts of Evil, but an Evil worse than all the Evils of <HI>Italy,</HI> he took of them where-ever he could find them, well knowing that worse could not befall him.</P>
<P>The Sea-Officers followed the Example of the Land-ones; and if they visited their Vessels, it was only to bring aboard them lewd Women. It was in the mean time impossible, that <HI>France</HI> should not have know∣ledg of these sorts of Disorders;
<PB N="123" REF="64"/> but the Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> held her by such sweet Bonds, that having com∣mitted the Fault to send him to <HI>Mes∣sina</HI> for a Viceroy, she had rather <HI>Messina</HI> should perish, than revoke this <HI>Sardanapalus.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the War, which every day grew hotter and hotter in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> had been so favourable to <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Parliament being now assembled, they humbly addressed to their King, who had at the end of the second Campaign made Peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> That he would be pleased to recall the English Troops, which were in the service of the French King; whereunto they also added, That he would declare War against the <HI>French,</HI> unless they abandoned the Protection of <HI>Messina,</HI> which was an Obstacle to the Peace that had been so long talkt of. The King of <HI>England,</HI> tho a Friend to <HI>France,</HI> yet condescending to the Requests of his People, sent to the French King to do both the one and the other, if he would have him still continue his Friend. This
<PB N="124" REF="65"/> News was a Thunder-clap to <HI>France;</HI> but since she must, as we may say, either obey, or resolve upon War with <HI>England,</HI> she began to shew the Choice she would make, by already dismissing the <HI>English</HI> that were in her Service. But it was here that her Insincerity appeared in its full ex∣tent, whereof perhaps the King of <HI>England</HI> may yet one day testify his Resentment, when his People, when the Fanatical Party amongst them had of late Years almost frighted in∣to a Rebellion, with Dreams and Visions of Popery and Arbitrary Go∣vernment, shall, which they begin a∣pace to do, have regained their for∣mer Loyalty and Zeal for his Service. You shall know then, that the <HI>English</HI> being dismiss'd, instead of making them go to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> or <HI>Calais,</HI> from thence to pass to <HI>Dover,</HI> which was their right way, they were sent through <HI>Burgundy,</HI> through <HI>Lionnois,</HI> and so through the Provinces which lead to the Ports of <HI>Guienne,</HI> that they might have time to debauch the Offi∣cers and the Souldiers. In effect,
<PB N="125" REF="65"/> the Souldiers, who since their being in <HI>France</HI> had been accustomed to Wine, seeing themselves in a Coun∣try where 'tis almost as common as Water, would not cross the Sea to go and drink Beer, but took Pay under the Captains of the Army of <HI>Cata∣lonia,</HI> who were for that purpose post∣ed in their way. As for the Officers, all those that had nothing to lose in their own Country, were likewise debauched, and placed at the same time in the Regiment of <HI>Furstemberg,</HI> which was in Garrison at <HI>Perpignan.</HI> Thus when the <HI>English</HI> arrived at the place where they were to imbarque, they were not the tenth part of what they should have been, if <HI>France</HI> had dealt faithfully in the matter. But let us see whether she will keep Faith any better with those of <HI>Messina.</HI></P>
<P>Being, as I have just now told you, necessitated either to abandon it, or to fall out with <HI>England,</HI> she had cho∣sen the first; she was in the mean time at a very great stand, how to bring it about without the knowledg of the <HI>Messineses,</HI> who, had they
<PB N="126" REF="66"/> known it, would not have failed to renew the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Vespers. To keep them then from knowing it, she be∣gan to spread a Report, that she would send into that Country another Person in the room of Mr. <HI>de Vivonne,</HI> insomuch that a Merchant, who had heard it at <HI>Rome,</HI> having related it at <HI>Messina,</HI> was put in Prison by the Order of the Viceroy, who was no way pleased with such sorts of News; but the Misfortune of the Merchant having more divulged the matter, every one was soon possess'd that there was a new Viceroy coming, and also that it was the Duke <HI>de la Feuil∣lade.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly altho I here blame <HI>France</HI> for her Dissimulation, I shall not for∣bear praising this new General, who acted with so much Order and Dis∣cretion at his Arrival, that no-body entred into distrust of that which brought him thither, and I can even say that there was not the least suspi∣cion of it, till such time as he was quite ready to set Sail. Before he arrived at <HI>Messina,</HI> he went ashore at
<PB N="127" REF="66"/> <HI>Augusta,</HI> where <HI>La Villedieu,</HI> who had been Captain of the Guards, was Governor; whom not having found at home, because he was, like the rest, making love to a Nun, he took one of his Horses, rode round the Ramparts, ordered new Fortificati∣ons, and in fine, gave his Orders like a Man that knew how to do something else than eat, drink, and sleep; af∣terwards, without staying a moment, he again went aboard his Vessel, and having continued his course, came in∣to the Road of <HI>Messina,</HI> whither the Jurats came in a Barque to receive him in Peace. The Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> came also to meet him upon the Har∣bor, where he gave him the right∣hand, as having no longer any Au∣thority in the Country. In effect, after he had dined with him, he went aboard a Vessel, set Sail for <HI>Provence,</HI> and endeavoured afterward to gain <HI>Lions,</HI> to get himself cured of a Ma∣lady, which began much to incom∣mode him.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de la Feuillade,</HI> after he had discoursed with the Jurats, went
<PB N="128" REF="67"/> upon the Harbor, whither he had sent for the Captains of the Gallies, whom he ask'd, whether they were ready to put to Sea? And when they answered that they were not, he demanded what hindred them, and against what time they could be ready? And they telling him, that it was impossible for them to be ready in less than a Months time, the Duke <HI>de la Feuillade,</HI> who knew what kind of life they led, made them so severe a Reprimand, that they well saw they had another manner of Man to deal with than Mr. <HI>de Vivonne.</HI> He told them, they might do as they thought good, but if they were not ready in eight days, he would put the Oars to his Vessels, and leave them to make love as long as they would. In the mean time, to cover this Haste with some considerable Design, he caused a Map to be drawn of all the neighbouring Towns which apper∣tained to the Enemies, as <HI>Saragosa, Melazzo, Palermo,</HI> and <HI>Sema,</HI> spread∣ing a report that he would soon march to reduce them.</P>
<PB N="129" REF="67"/>
<P>In the mean time, he sware upon the Holy Gospels in the Name of the King his Master, to protect the Coun∣try against all Persons whatever, and to keep their Privileges; an Oath which nevertheless he soon after brake, as I will shew you in its place. The Ceremony of taking it was ve∣ry fine, it was performed in the great Church, which they had hung with the richest Hangings in the Town, and whither the People came in so great a Croud, that they did not on that day think on their Misery: The Streets also through which the Vice∣roy was to pass, were hung, and Scaffolds erected every where to see him go: For tho he seemed to be come to deprive the Women of their Pleasures, yet since it was nothing but their Misery which made them do as they did, they look'd upon him however as the <HI>Messias,</HI> that was come to deliver every one from the Tyranny of Satan, I mean the Oppression of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> He observed, moreover, as he pass'd along, that one of the Citizens, the more to shew his Zeal
<PB N="130" REF="68"/> for the Service of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> had placed on the side of his Chamber-window a Canopy, under which was the Portrait of the King; and as he came back, he caused his Coach, wherein were the Jurats, to stop before that House, and told them, That since they came from making him swear before GOD to protect them and all the People, and to keep their Privileges; he desired, that they also should swear before the Portraiture of the King his Master, which was there present, that they would keep all Fidelity to him, would never speak of returning under the Dominion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and would cause to be severely punished, the first that should be so bold as to mention any such thing. At the same time these poor People, to whom an Interpreter had explicated what he said, (for he spake no otherwise to the Jurats, nor the Jurats to him) fell upon their Knees, and putting forth their hands out of the door of the Coach, sware before the Portraiture of the King all he would have them swear.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="68"/>
<P>This profound Dissimulation pro∣duced all the Effect he expected from it; they were confirmed daily more and more by his Conduct, that he would be the Deliverer of the State. Thus as he persisted always in the Resolution, as he said, of besieging <HI>Saragosa</HI> or <HI>Melazzo,</HI> for he spake no more of <HI>Palermo,</HI> they not only suf∣fered him to embarque Store of Vic∣tuals without suspicion, but the Ju∣rats also offered to encrease his Troops with some Companies of Ci∣tizens, if he thought he had not Forces sufficient for so great a Design. When the Provisions were inmbarqued, he caused the Foot to go aboard the Vessels, and there being now nothing to do but to withdraw the Hospital, he spake to the Jurats to find him out a Man, with whom he might bargain for the subsistence of the said Hospi∣tal, and he would lay him down Mo∣ney before-hand; but his Design, he said, was to leave as few People there as he could, because he believed the ill Air did them more hurt than their Malady it self; and when he should
<PB N="132" REF="69"/> once be before <HI>Saragosa</HI> or <HI>Melazzo,</HI> he would send them a League or two thence to take the Air, which would contribute more to their Health, than all the Remedies in the World. By this means he so well cajoled them, that they themselves sought him out the Man he desired, to whom he gave two Months Advance for fifty poor Wretches, who had their Soul upon their Lips, and who were so far from being able to brook the Sea, that it was judged they could not so much as get to the Vessel without certain Death. As for the others, they were imbarqued in a Vessel by themselves. So that this being done, the Duke <HI>de la Feuillade</HI> had nothing more to fear; for his Horse were at <HI>Augusta,</HI> all ready to imbarque, ex∣pecting only Vessels for that purpose. In the mean time, there being four∣teen Pieces of Cannon in Battery up∣on the Mouth of the Haven, he made his Vessels go out thence into the Road, whither he himself also went, after he was got aboard the Admiral. Thence he sent for the Jurats, to
<PB N="133" REF="69"/> whom he had given the most specious Orders in the World, of what they should do in his absence; and these over-credulous Jurats, imagining that he had forgot to tell them something, hasted diligently aboard him, but were very much surprized to hear him speak in these terms: <HI>That it was now no longer time to disguise any thing unto them, that the Expedition he was going to make, was to return into</HI> France, <HI>where the King his Master had need of his Troops and his Vessels; that as long as he could assist them, he had done it with a great deal of Joy and Clemency, since it had cost him above four and forty Millions; that now he could no longer do it, it was for them to find in their Constancy the Consolation which perhaps he could not give them.</HI></P>
<P>A Complement so dry, and so little expected, cast these poor Peo∣ple into a Despair, more easy to be conceived than described. They en∣deavoured to dissuade him from his Design by the most moving Words imaginable, and by Actions also the most submiss, casting themselves ma∣ny
<PB N="134" REF="70"/> times at his Knees; but seeing that all this operated nothing, they be∣sought him, that he would at least delay his departure for eight days, to the end that during that time, those who could no longer hope for Mercy from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they had so mortally offended, might re∣tire into <HI>France</HI> with their Families. A Prayer so just and so reasonable, ought not, methinks, to have been refused. But the Duke <HI>de la Feuillade,</HI> who gloried in being pitiless, told them, That this could not be, and that all he had to say to them was, That if those who would come, were not ready by the Morrow-Morning, he would weigh Anchor, and no lon∣ger expect any one. They gained however by the force of their Pray∣ers one Day more; after which they went to declare this sorrowful News to the Inhabitants, who were in so terrible a despair thereat, that I do not believe the like was ever seen. All the Men, all the Women, all the Children came upon the Haven, pier∣cing the Air with their Complaints,
<PB N="135" REF="70"/> and tearing the Hair from their Heads; there was heard only a dread∣ful Groaning, whereunto succeeded a mournful Silence, as it were, to give the <HI>French</HI> time to make reflection on their Miseries: but seeing, in fine, that they were not moved therewith, they began again the same Lamen∣tations, with Postures so worthy of Pity, that I shall never, as long as I live, think thereon, without being touched with compassion. In fine, seeing that this operated no more than before, every one resolved to em∣barque and there were four hundred of the best and richest Families in the Town, which pass'd into <HI>France,</HI> but with little satisfaction: For the <HI>French</HI> having soon after imputed to them a Conspiracy in <HI>Provence,</HI> whe∣ther it were true, or only a pretence to get rid of them, made them go out of the Country, and they are gone to linger out their Miseries in another Climate, where perhaps more compassion will be taken of their Misfortunes.</P>
<PB N="136" REF="71"/>
<P>As for those that remained at <HI>Mes∣sina,</HI> their Punishment was very spee∣dy: For the <HI>French</HI> had not yet weighed Anchor, when there arose in the Town a <HI>Spanish Faction,</HI> which had always subsisted therein, and which had several times endeavoured to reduce it under the obedience of its true Master. To this there op∣posed it self another, which would not hear speak of ever falling again under the Yoke of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and they were going to decide their Difference by compleating the Deso∣lation of this Town, the Image whereof was already but too fright∣ful, if the Governor of <HI>Regio,</HI> who was not above two Leagues off, had not stept in to hinder the Disorder. Whilst he was negotiating on the one and other side, to make them lay down their Arms, with Assurance of Pardon to both of them; the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> having by the help of their Faction made themselves Masters of the Town, entred thereinto with Drums beating, breathing forth no-but a just Vengeance, but which they
<PB N="137" REF="71"/> rendred too cruel by their manner of taking it; for without demurring any farther, as many People as put their Heads out of the Windows to see them pass, so many did they kill, at least of those who appeared to be any thing, aiming particularly at Persons of Quality.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to tell how many Massacres they made in this poor desolate Town, nor how much they thereby augmented the Aversion the People already had for them: for, besides that I should perhaps have difficulty enough to do it, things were carried to such extremities, it belongs not to my Subject, whereun∣to I should do much better to return, without digressing any farther.</P>
<P>The abandoning of <HI>Messina,</HI> joined to the Inclination which the King of <HI>England</HI> always had for <HI>France,</HI> brought again upon the Board the Propositions of Peace, which had al∣ready been talk'd of before, but that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would never hearken to them, because the <HI>French</HI> King spake not of restoring <HI>Messina.</HI> When I
<PB N="138" REF="72"/> speak here of Propositions of Peace, it is easily understood that I will speak of what pass'd in the Cabinet of Princes, and not of what pass'd at <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where they had already wasted so long time to no purpose. These Propositions did not equally please every Body: For altho the Emperor and Princes of the Empire, had done nothing yet so ad∣vantagious, but that a good Peace was to be preferr'd before so unpro∣fitable a War, since nevertheless they considered, that in the condition wherein things were, they could not hope for such an one as they desired, and as was to be wish'd for the Good of <HI>Europe,</HI> they were rather of opi∣nion to continue the War, than to do any thing whereof they might for the future repent. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> added thereunto, That since it was not easy to reassemble, when once they should be separated, they ought to take good care not to do it, without knowing how and upon what terms. But the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who in the Party of the Confederates had
<PB N="139" REF="72"/> the Power which the Jesuits attribute to the Pope, that is, of binding and loosing, said on the contrary, That for their part they were weary of the War: and as they had not the Keys of the Apostle, but the Keys of the Chest, my meaning is, that they pro∣vided for the Appointment, they said in two words, That they must treat, otherwise that they had not where∣withal to furnish out so great Ex∣pences.</P>
<P>This was a determinate Sentence to the greatest part of the Confederates, every one thought then only of ma∣king his Treaty the most advantagi∣ous he could. But as this was all that <HI>France</HI> desired, to wit, to dis∣unite them, she took care only to content the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in whom con∣sisted all the Strength of the Party. To this two things might much con∣tribute: the one, to restore unto them the Town of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> which they had in vain endeavoured to reco∣ver by Arms; the other, to give them some assurance that the Peace should be durable, and not subject to be
<PB N="140" REF="73"/> broken on the first occasion. As to the former, <HI>France</HI> did not at all he∣sitate; she promised at first the Resti∣tution of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> which gave the <HI>Hollanders</HI> more desire than ever to terminate the War, for they saw their Frontiers thereby assured, as well as their State in its first Splen∣dor. For the other, she procured the King of <HI>England</HI> to intervene, who promised to be Guarant of the Peace. And to give a great Idea of its Duration, there were Propositi∣ons made in respect of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom she offered to restore certain Places, which were to serve for a Barrier, as well to her as to the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> who by this means saw that <HI>France</HI> removed yet farther from their Neighbourhood, which was all they had to desire, not loving so dangerous a Neighbour. The <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> before they accepted of these Conditions, did all they could, be∣ing deceived by Appearances, to make them be accepted also by their Allies; but seeing that they were ob∣stinate not to do any thing therein,
<PB N="141" REF="73"/> they made their Peace apart, imagi∣ning well, as the truth was, that this would soon oblige them to speak o∣therwise. In the mean time, they sent to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was gone towards <HI>Mons,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had a long time block'd up, and which was very much straitned, to draw back his Troops. But whe-this Prince received not their Pacquets time enough, or whether he were in despair to see that they had let them∣selves be deceived by the Artifices of the <HI>French,</HI> he gave them Battel, believing perhaps to make the States change their Design, by doing some Action of great Eclat. This Fight was obstinate enough; but after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had forced the <HI>French,</HI> and gained a notable Ad∣vantage over them, he caused the Peace to be published, rather not to appear disobedient to the Orders of the Republick, than for any reason he had to hope for any good from it.</P>
<P>This Peace was followed by that of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Emperor, and the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> but the Mar∣quess
<PB N="142" REF="74"/> of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> finding that, according as his Accommodation had been proposed, it was wholly disad∣vantagious to him, refused to sign it: and this Refusal having obliged <HI>France</HI> to carry her Arms as far as <HI>Mindem,</HI> where there was some Skir∣mish to hinder the Passage of the Ri∣ver, the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> was fain to bend, but with little sa∣tisfaction to <HI>Suedeland,</HI> on whose be∣half the <HI>French</HI> had nevertheless un∣dertaken this War: For tho all the Princes restored her a great part of what they had gotten from her, yet since they still kept something, she i∣magined that all that <HI>France</HI> did for her, was nothing in comparison of what she ought to do, considering the Perils whereunto she had exposed her self, and even the Losses she had suffered for her sake: In effect, for having been willing at her suscitation to make a Diversion in <HI>Germany,</HI> she had lost the greatest part of her Ves∣sels, the Esteem of her Neighbours, her Riches, her Reputation, and in one word, was reduced to so bad a
<PB N="143" REF="74"/> Condition, that if the War had con∣tinued any longer, it would have been impossible to say what would become of her Fortune.</P>
<P>This first Discontent of <HI>Suedeland,</HI> was soon followed by two others, whereof one touched her Interest, and the other her Honour. The first was the Homage, which <HI>France</HI> de∣manded of her for the Dutchy of <HI>Deuxponts,</HI> by virtue of a Decree of the Royal Chamber of <HI>Mets,</HI> at this day so known and renowned in all <HI>Europe.</HI> The second was, the Re∣fusal she made to pay her the Subsidies she owed her of old; if she did not first consent to renew the Treaty which was between the two Crowns, and was very near expiring.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Hollanders</HI> saw that the <HI>French</HI> King was already preparing to make new Alliances, they began on their side to think of securing themselves from his Enterprises. For this purpose they proposed a League with the neighbouring Princes, where∣of the King having knowledg, was so offended thereat, that tho he would
<PB N="144" REF="75"/> himself have subjected the <HI>Suede</HI> to what I just now told you, he failed not to command the Count <HI>d' Avann,</HI> his Ambassador at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to tell the States, That if they prosecuted any further the Treaty they had be∣gun, he should take it for an Act of Hostility, and should see what he had to do. These Menaces were odious to all honest Persons, but they were so far from being frighted by them in <HI>Holland,</HI> that on the contra∣ry they made haste to conclude the Treaty, and to defend their Liberty by Arms, which they resolved also no more to lay down but upon good Terms, if the King obliged them to take them up again, whereof they were nevertheless in expectation eve∣ry day, till the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> was raised, which will perhaps make him think twice upon what he hath to do.</P>
<P>However it be, the Haughtiness wherewith he acted towards Sove∣reign Powers, giving cause to fear every thing from his Ambition, <HI>Suedeland</HI> made also a League with
<PB N="145" REF="75"/> <HI>Holland,</HI> by which they promised one another reciprocal Assistance. The King of <HI>France</HI> seeing that <HI>Suedeland</HI> had declared against him, was interi∣orly vexed thereat; but without letting it be seen, he sollicits the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> the ancient Enemies of the <HI>Suede,</HI> to enter into League with him, wherein he found not much dif∣ficulty; for these two Princes were so ill contented with the last Peace they were obliged to make, that they would not hear speak of allying them∣selves any more with Princes, who had so shamefully, as we may say, abandoned them. This was the rea∣son that the Ministers of the Empe∣ror, who pretended not only to op∣pose this Alliance, but also to make one with these two Princes, were so little hearkned unto. Add here∣unto, that their Interests sufficiently accorded with their Resentment; for as to <HI>Denmark,</HI> he never entred into any League wherein the <HI>Suede</HI> was; and there is as great an Antipathy between those two Crowns, as
<PB N="146" REF="76"/> there can be between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> he has for a long time also had a Pique at the <HI>Suede,</HI> ever since the great <HI>Gustavus</HI> got from him. <HI>Pomerania,</HI> which he had nevertheless reconquered with so much Glory during these last Wars, but was not happy enough to keep it, and that, as I have said, for having been abandoned by his Allies.</P>
<P>This Seed of War was soon fol∣lowed by Hostilities, much more ap∣parent on the side of <HI>France.</HI> All on a sudden, and when they least thought of it, she seized on the Town of <HI>Strasburg;</HI> and when the Emperor thought to make his Complaints thereof by the Count <HI>de Mansfield,</HI> whom he sent expresly to St. <HI>Germain en Laye,</HI> she answered the Count <HI>de Mansfield,</HI> That she wondred the Emperor should meddle with that which nothing concerned her; that <HI>Strasburg</HI> was one of the Dependen∣cies of <HI>Alsatia,</HI> and consequently be∣longed to her by virtue of the Treaty
<PB N="147" REF="76"/> of <HI>Munster.</HI> If the Emperor had been well counselled, not only then, but a long time before, this Misfor∣tune would not perhaps have befallen all <HI>Germany:</HI> for he had already suf∣fered but too much from <HI>France,</HI> who by virtue of a certain Right of De∣pendence, which she had set up to invade the Estates of every one, rui∣ned both Princes and Gentlemen; these of their Goods, by putting Gar∣risons upon them; those of their Ho∣nour, by depriving them of all Right of Sovereignty. But it was in vain for them to complain to him thereof; he had rather believe his Ministers, or, to say better, his Jesuits, than his Dignity, which would not permit him to suffer such an Affront without resenting it. He had remitted all this to the Diet; and the Diet, in∣stead of speedily determining things, as the Nature of the Affair required, spun them out in length, as if they had themselves been of accord with the Enemies of the Empire.</P>
<P>A Proceeding so feeble on all sides, gave <HI>France</HI> in the mean time oppor∣tunity
<PB N="148" REF="77"/> to make new Enterprises; and not content with having entren∣ched on the Liberty of <HI>Germany,</HI> she encroached also on that of <HI>Italy,</HI> which began to tremble, seeing her Troops in <HI>Casal.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had hitherto been Spectators of all that passed in <HI>Germany,</HI> began then to make a great Stir, so much the more, as that <HI>France</HI> had besieged the Town of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> under pre∣text also of that Right of Depen∣dence, whereof I just now spake. They moved Heaven and Earth to stir up the Potentates to cause Justice to be done them; but every one was as deaf, as if they had been hired by <HI>France</HI> to conspire with her in all she did. In fine, the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> as well that which is in <HI>Spain,</HI> as that which is in <HI>Germany,</HI> rouzed up it self, and seeing that the <HI>French</HI> had not yet fortified <HI>Casal</HI> nor <HI>Strasburg,</HI> they resolved to make some Attempt upon these two Places, before new Works and a stronger Garrison ren∣dred the thing more difficult. <HI>France,</HI> seeing that the Troops of the Em∣peror
<PB N="149" REF="77"/> drew near to <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and that those of <HI>Milan</HI> took the way of <HI>Casal,</HI> drew back at the same time hers from before <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> and made them march towards the Fron∣tiers. This Motion hindred the House of <HI>Austria</HI> from attempting any thing: but <HI>France</HI> would not ac∣knowledg why she had raised the Siege; on the contrary, she published that it was only through Generosity, the <HI>Turks</HI> being ready to make a de∣scent into <HI>Hungary,</HI> whereinto never∣theless they entred not till above a year after.</P>
<P>The Blocking up of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> had furnished abundance of People farther matter of Discourse. Honest Persons amongst the <HI>French,</HI> as well as other Nations, could not them∣selves sufficiently admire, that in the midst of a profound Peace, there should thus be so many Hostilities committed. But that which gave some occasion, as we may say, to weep, made others laugh, seeing they had not the courage to oppose it. In the mean time, <HI>France</HI> had no
<PB N="150" REF="78"/> sooner what she demanded, but she would have something more. And like herein to those Persons, who af∣ter they have a long time fasted, are not contented with a little nourish∣ment; so was not she contented to have thus one Place or two at a time, but she wanted a whole World to sa∣tisfy her Ambition. But since she had proved in the last War, that she should hardly bring it about by force, she resolved to make use of Address, a Means much less dangerous, and often more efficacious. Now to pre∣tend that this should be by dividing the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> besides that it was a thing which would require long time, and was moreover subject to change, because tho they might be deceived, yet not so far as to suf∣fer themselves to be utterly ruined, there was nothing sure therein, every one being in distrust. To shorten therefore the matter, she resolved to bring the <HI>Turk</HI> into <HI>Germany,</HI> hoping that the Empire, seeing it self mena∣ced by so redoubted an Enemy, would never fail to call him to its Assistance,
<PB N="151" REF="78"/> not having Forces of its own to re∣sist such a Power. <HI>Guilleragues,</HI> her Ambassador, who had so many Dis∣putes with the Grand-Visier touching the Affair of <HI>Scio,</HI> having received her Orders, believed it was a means for him to gain a good Esteem with the Port, which, like <HI>France,</HI> desi∣red only to invade the Estates of others.</P>
<P>In effect, the Grand-Visier, who since his advancement to that Office, had done nothing to make himself talk'd of, and who was very glad to bring himself into Esteem, received the Proposition so much the more a∣greeably, as he imagined the thing to be easy, after the manner that <HI>Guille∣ragues</HI> proposed it unto him: For this Ambassador promised, that as soon as he should be entred into <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> the King his Master should make Diversion on the side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the Grand-Visier knowing the Forces of <HI>France,</HI> no way doubted but that the Empire, being thus attack'd on two sides by two such considerable Powers, would in a short time be
<PB N="152" REF="79"/> brought to yield. <HI>Teckely,</HI> chief of the Malecontents of <HI>Hungary,</HI> with whom <HI>France</HI> held correspondence from the beginning of his Revolt, as∣sured the Grand-Visier of the same thing; for she caused the same Dis∣courses to be made to him, as to the Grand-Visier: but she deceived them both; and since, whatever Ambition she had, she endeavoured not to lose her Reputation amongst the neigh∣bouring Princes, she sought only to bring the Empire so low, that it could never rise again but by her means.</P>
<P>The Grand-Visier being so well a∣nimated to this Enterprize, caused such terrible Preparations to be made in all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, that not only the Emperor was alarmed there∣at, but also all <HI>Italy,</HI> which extreme∣ly apprehended lest this great Storm should pour down upon her. The Pope excited all the Christian Princes to give help against this common E∣nemy of Christendom: but knowing enough the State of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to believe that there was
<PB N="153" REF="79"/> no∣thing to be expected from that side, he sent a Brief to the King, by which he exhorted him, that in case his In∣terests permitted him not to assist the Emperor himself, he would at least not hinder other Princes from assist∣ing him. And for to give Example to others, he sollicited the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> to contribute with him to the making up a good Sum of Money, which he sent to the Emperor as soon as ever he could no longer doubt that it was against him that such extraor∣dinary Preparations were made.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>France,</HI> to make a shew of dealing sincerely with the Grand-Visier, caused her Troops to advance to the Frontiers, which did not much less astonish the Empire, than all the Preparations made a∣gainst it by the <HI>Turk.</HI> The Diet, whereof I spake before, thought it expedient, seeing the Arms of two such great Princes so ready to trouble the Repose of all <HI>Germany,</HI> to make the King explain his Design, and caused his Ambassador to write unto him for that purpose: But the King,
<PB N="154" REF="80"/> who cared not to declare his thoughts, answered, That he was not to give account of his Actions to any one; but that he would however tell them, that it was for them to give him speedy satisfaction upon all his Pretensions, otherwise he should take such course as himself thought best. In effect, not content with ha∣ving despoiled so many Princes of their Liberty, with having invaded <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and the ten Free-Towns, contrary to the Faith of Treaties, with retaining the Estates of the Princes of <HI>Petite Pierre</HI> and <HI>Waldens,</HI> without any appearance of Justice; and so many other things, which would be too long to particularize; he would also have the Diet to de∣clare, that whatever he had done was according to the Rules of Equity, and the Emperor himself must sub∣scribe this Declaration. Thus would he establish by the Right of Nations, what he had usurped only by Right of Convenience, and would have a Treaty to cover his Faith-breaking and Injustice. For my part, I shall
<PB N="155" REF="80"/> not blame those of the Diet, who counselled the Emperor to yield to the Time, to accommodate himself with <HI>France,</HI> which in the condition wherein things then were, was capa∣ble to do him a great deal of Mischief, and in fine, not to lose the Empire by unseasonable Stiffness; because I will believe that what they did was out of a good design. But the Em∣peror, all beset as he was with the E∣missaries of <HI>France,</HI> was not yet so deprived of his Understanding, but that he easily discerned whither such a Step as this tended, which by dis∣crediting him in the Empire, would have as much raised the Credit of the King of <HI>France,</HI> who desired only to enter thereinto like a Fox, but would afterwards have kept himself there like a Lion. In effect, he no sooner saw the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> but belie∣ving them now too far advanced to go back again, he retired from his Troops, at the Head whereof he had put himself under pretence of a Re∣view, to create the greater Jealousy.</P>
<PB N="156" REF="81"/>
<P>In the mean time, he caused the Electors, a good part of which were his Friends, to be told under∣hand, that they ought to call him to the assistance of the Empire, which was in danger of falling down under the Power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> if it were not supported by Forces capable to resist him. But on the other side, he ex∣cited the Grand-Visier to go streight to <HI>Vienna,</HI> without staying either at <HI>Raab</HI> or <HI>Camorra,</HI> adding, That these Places would fall of themselves, as soon as ever he should make himself Master of the other, which would draw also with it the Ruine of the whole Empire, and the Consternation of all the Electors. Altho the Grand-Visier distrusted the Sincerity of <HI>France,</HI> of whose Designs he every day learnt something; yet he belie∣ved however that this Counsel could not be amiss: and resolving to follow it, after he had terribly wasted the Country, he sent Detachments from under his Conduct, to block up these two Places so close, that their Gar∣risons might not incommode the
<PB N="157" REF="81"/> Convoys which came to his Army.</P>
<P>He marched afterwards on the side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> having already pass'd the <HI>Raab,</HI> by Intelligence with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> to whom the Defence thereof had been committed, and came to plant his Camp before <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> to the great astonishment of Christendom, and especially of the Emperor, who was obliged to retire to <HI>Lintz,</HI> whither the Jesuits would follow him, as faithful Companions of his Fortune. In the mean time, they not having been able to find Conveniences to depart all the same day, some of them were by the Peo∣ple immolated to their just Resent∣ment, as they pretended to follow their Fellows. They sent them to keep company with the three <HI>Hunga∣rian</HI> Barons, whom they had some time since caused to be put to death through Covetousness of their Estates, upon which the inferior People laid the Cause of the War, altho it had indeed another Original, as I think I have demonstrated. In effect, be∣sides all that I have already said, to
<PB N="158" REF="82"/> shew the Intelligence which the King of <HI>France</HI> held with the <HI>Turk,</HI> there happened a thing which no longer left any room to doubt it: For the Letters of one of her Ministers Se∣cretary were surprized, by which all the Intrigue was discovered; so that the Emperor having caused him to be arrested, was resolved to punish him severely: but understand∣ing that <HI>France</HI> had on her side ar∣rested the Secretary of the Ambassa∣dor the Count <HI>de Mansfield,</HI> whom she threatned to treat in the same manner as the Emperor should do the other, he durst not push things any farther, but was contented with threatning him severely, so to dis∣cover how far this Intelligence ex∣tended.</P>
<P>Moreover; Whether <HI>France</HI> ex∣pected to take great Resolutions up∣on what should pass at the Siege, or whether she were only willing to be the first that should know in what manner it would turn, the Marquess <HI>de Seppeville,</HI> her Envoy at the Empe∣ror's Court, had Order to dispatch
<PB N="159" REF="82"/> Couriers unto her upon the least Cir∣cumstances, which nevertheless suffi∣ciently testified, that it was something more than Curiosity which made her act. There came to her three in one Week, and Foreign Ministers learnt nothing but by her means. But she continually misrepresented things: for at first there ran a Report at <HI>Paris,</HI> that <HI>Vienna</HI> was already lost, which she was above all very desirous to insinuate into the Ministers of other Princes, whom, without ma∣king shew of any thing, she caused in the mean time to be sounded, to know whereon their Masters would determine, in case this News should be found true.</P>
<P>I could here, if I would, relate a∣bundance of memorable Actions that past at this Siege, whereof I have as good Memoirs as any other; but since in matter of War I never con∣cern my self to speak, but of those things where I have been present, I shall forbear to do it, contenting my self to relate here those which con∣cern my Subject, to wit, those where∣in
<PB N="160" REF="83"/> reigns the Insincerity of <HI>France,</HI> to the end that every one may take heed thereof. I am, moreover, going to surprize abundance of People, by saying, that her Design was not at first that the <HI>Turks</HI> should seize on <HI>Vienna;</HI> but let every one believe what he will, this shall not hinder me from continuing to speak the Truth, making above all things profession to do it, without suffering my self to be diverted from it by ought whatever. Now to prove my Assertion, there needs only to know the Offers she had made, and still every day did make to the Emperor, to send fifty thou∣sand Men to raise the Siege; the Ef∣forts she made with the Electors, to incline the Emperor to accept this Succour; the secret Reflections she prayed them to make on the State wherein the Empire was, and on the Necessity it had to be assisted, not only powerfully, but also speedily; that the Forces of <HI>Poland</HI> were nei∣ther yet assembled, nor assembling; that besides, they were not such Troop as they imagined, that it was
<PB N="161" REF="83"/> rather an Arrierban than an Army; that the Great Men of the Country were not all so contented, as they were said to be, with the Alliance which the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had made with the Emperor; and in fine, that they would bring so many Obstacles to the Succour which the Emperor thought to draw from thence, that they might indeed always talk of it, but should never see it come: That, on the contrary, that of <HI>France</HI> be∣ing quite ready, would march at the first Command; that the <HI>French</HI> were as good as the <HI>Polanders</HI> at Handy-Strokes, which this occasion requi∣red; that they had besides more Obedience and Experience, two things so necessary for the having an happy Success in their Enterprizes.</P>
<P>Certainly all these Reasons were specious to him that should not have been prepossest of her Unfaithfulness. But since all the Resistance which was made at <HI>Vienna,</HI> was to no other end, but not to see the Empire fall into the hands of another, it was believed
<PB N="162" REF="84"/> that all these Offers were rather to be rejected than accepted. In the mean time, they prayed the <HI>French</HI> King, since he had such good Designs, that he would remove his Troops from the Frontiers, the Jealousy whereof hindred abundance of the Princes of the Empire from sending theirs to the assistance of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But he an∣swered, That if they let the Empire be lost through their default, he would save it tho against their Wills; that he would keep himself always armed, and ready to assist them at the first Request they should make him; that he gave them his Word he would attempt nothing against the Empire, and that his Word ought to suffice them. But what reliance could there be upon a Word which had been so often violated, as I think I have shewn? Upon a Word, of the Frailty whereof there were so many Examples, and which, to excuse it self, still sought Pretences to cast up∣on others the Faults whereof it was it self only guilty? Upon a Word, in fine, which acknowledged no other
<PB N="163" REF="84"/> Law but Force and Violence, which would have every thing pass accord∣ing to its own Will; which would have all bend under it, Sovereign Princes, and those that were not so; but which never wanted Pretences to palliate whatever it did, were one but never so little in the humor to let ones self be seduced by its delu∣sory Persuasions?</P>
<P>These Considerations, which had obliged the Emperor to refuse so great a Succour, obliged also the o∣ther Princes to believe, that it was neither the Empires Interest nor their own to press the Emperor to accept it. Thus every one being in suspense, the Grand-Visier made a terrible Ra∣vage in all <HI>Austria,</HI> where he found not any Resistance: and tho the <HI>French</HI> King was not entred into <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> as he had promised, he ceased not to make a great Diversion, as I just now said, no-body daring to send away their Troops, for fear those of <HI>France</HI> should invade what they should find for their convenience.
<PB N="164" REF="85"/> Many Persons were thus led away in∣to Captivity by the Infidels, who be∣fore their besieging <HI>Vienna</HI> had de∣tached the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to come and make their Courses as far as the Gates of that Town. These Barbarians set fire where-ever they passed, pillaged the Castle of <HI>Laxembourg,</HI> and after they had carried away all the Goods that were therein, cut down also the Trees of the Avenues, through de∣spite (as it were) for not having found therein all the Riches they ex∣pected: from thence they retired to their Body, leaving in all the Places of their Passage, Marks of their Bar∣barity and Cruelty.</P>
<P>These Beginnings of the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> were happy enough to the In∣fidels; for all Places being yet fill'd with their Cruelties, and they having besides gained some Advantages over the Troops of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> General of the Emperor's Army, the Garrison, the greatest part whereof was composed of that Army, seemed apprehensive of coming to Blows
<PB N="165" REF="85"/> with them. This exceedingly trou∣bled the Governour, the Count <HI>de Starenberg,</HI> who had resolved to keep the Town for the Emperor, or at least to lose his Life upon the Breach; but he having found the means to rid them of all Fear, yet more through his own Example, than through any thing he could say to them, things soon changed their Face, and as much as the Imperialists were before appre∣hensive of the <HI>Turks,</HI> so much did the <HI>Turks</HI> then begin to be apprehensive of the Imperialists, who had daily some Advantage in every Sally. The Grand-Visier was not however re∣butted, but thought it strange that <HI>France,</HI> having promised him to make a puissant Diversion, should content her self only to look on, without keeping her Word. He complained thereof to <HI>Tekely,</HI> with whom he held Communication by Letters; and <HI>Tekely</HI> to <HI>Bohan,</HI> who was <HI>France</HI>'s Correspondent with him. <HI>Bohan</HI> failed not on his side to make his Complaint to Mr. <HI>de Seppeville,</HI> to whom he sentword, That the Grand-Visier,
<PB N="166" REF="86"/> uncertain of the Sieges Suc∣cess, might perhaps come to an A∣greement with the Imperialists; that it was for him to foresee the Prejudice which such a Treaty might bring to the Crown, and to apply the Reme∣dy he should judg convenient; but for his own part, he thought there was no other choice, but either to keep their Word, or by not keeping it, to resolve upon a Quarrel with the Grand-Visier.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> having knowledg of these things by a Courier which the Mar∣quess <HI>de Seppeville</HI> dispatched to her, and which arrived at <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> on Sunday the 29th of <HI>August,</HI> found her self very much embarassed, how to make her Politicks agree with so pressing a Demand. It was not ma∣ny days since she had given her Word not to attack the Empire; and con∣sidering, that if she should so soon break it without any cause, or even so much as pretence, she should not only draw upon her self the Reproa∣ches of all <HI>Europe,</HI> but should also
<PB N="167" REF="86"/> for ever lose the Confidence of the Electors, whom she managed with a great deal of care, she took a Reso∣lution which seemed to her capable to satisfy both the one and the other Party; that is to say, Not to attack the Empire directly, for fear of lo∣sing her Reputation with the Electors; but to carry her Arms into <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> which ought in some sort to satisfy the Grand-Visier, because this War had so great a Concatenation with all the neighbouring Powers, that it would soon put a good part of <HI>Europe</HI> in combustion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it befell her, as it ordinarily doth those who will please two Persons at a time, that is, that she neither pleased the Grand-Visier, nor the Electors. For these, whom the King had endeavoured to persuade, as he had done also all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> that his rising up from before <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> whereof I ere-while spake, was because of the Descent of the <HI>Turks</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> thought it strange that this Reason, which was
<PB N="168" REF="87"/> then so remote from Danger, should no longer subsist now when the Dan∣ger was so near. The Grand-Visier, on the other side, did not like, that all these great Promises terminated in making Spoil amongst People, Allies indeed of the Empire, but yet so re∣mote from it, whereas he desired that all these Hostilities should have been committed in the Center there∣of. But <HI>France,</HI> who cared little for the Ends of either of them, provi∣ded she might attain her own, let them say what they pleased, flat∣tering her self, that in respect of the <HI>Turks</HI> she had sufficiently satisfied the Engagement she had with them, by attacking <HI>Flanders,</HI> which makes part of <HI>Low-Germany;</HI> and for what con∣cerns the Electors, they had no rea∣son to complain, because she had kept her self within her Promise, which was only not to attack the Em∣peror, or Princes of the Empire. She believed moreover, that this Procee∣ding of hers terrifying <HI>Spain,</HI> and her Allies, in regard of the present Conjuncture, they would all conspire,
<PB N="169" REF="87"/> as diligently as they possibly could, to cause the Town of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> to be given her, for fear she should make greater Conquests, whereof they were apprehensive in the Con∣ditions wherein things were, and the Arms of the most part of the neigh∣bouring Princes being employed, as they were, either in combating the <HI>Turk,</HI> or only observing him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whom it greatly concerned not to suffer this Crown to make thus eve∣ry day new Attempts upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Loss whereof drew along that of their Provinces, assembled amongst themselves, to see what Remedy they might bring thereunto. To which they were moreover every day exci∣ted by Mr. <HI>de Fuen-Maior,</HI> Envoy of <HI>Spain,</HI> who spake so plainly of the King his Master's Inability to defend that Country, that he ingenuously confest unto them, that it could no longer be preserved without their Assistance. Many of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> concluded at first upon War, and
<PB N="170" REF="88"/> they were without doubt the most il∣luminated; but others, Lovers of Repose, and besides more attached to Commerce, having made use of the Pretence of the present Conjun∣ctures, for to render them apprehen∣sive of breaking Peace with so power∣ful a Crown, said, that their Opini∣on was to bring Matters to an Ac∣commodation. This Diversity of Opinions delayed their Resolution for ten or twelve days, during which they every day endeavoured to open the Eyes of those that were blinded, hoping besides that <HI>Vienna</HI> would be relieved, which would perhaps have drawn their Minds to do that which was convenient for the Glory and In∣terest of the State. But this News not coming, and they receiving on the contrary from day to day advice, that the Grand-Visier was obstinate to continue the Siege, caused his Camp to be wonderfully fortified, and in fine, prepared himself to fight the Relief, if any came, the States no longer expected that time to re∣solve; but the well-intention'd ha∣ving
<PB N="171" REF="88"/> made the others at last to take Resolutions worthy of their Courage, they determined to succour poor af∣flicted <HI>Flanders,</HI> by sending her eight thousand Men to put in her Places, and making a far greater Number to march, if Necessity required it.</P>
<P>This Resolution being taken, they sent Order to the Officers to leave their Garrisons, and march towards the Frontiers; and the Troops which were to pass into <HI>Flanders,</HI> pass'd thither, and the others entred into those Places of <HI>Brabant</HI> which belong∣ed to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as being more exposed to the Enterprizes of <HI>France,</HI> which they knew not yet whether to treat as a Friend or an Enemy; for she caused every day the States to be told by her Ambassador, that her de∣sign was not to break with any one, but to cause Justice to be done her concerning the County of <HI>Alost,</HI> which she pretended to be of the De∣pendencies of what had been granted her by the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> In the mean time, they still expected
<PB N="172" REF="89"/> with impatience the Success of the Succour which was preparing for <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> her self also ex∣pected the same, for to take openly her Resolutions upon what should arrive there; but at last, after a long expectation, they learnt that this Success was as glorious as the Christi∣ans could desire, the Grand-Visier's Infantry being totally routed, their Cavalry very much endammaged, all their Cannon and Baggage lost; in fine, the Place succoured; with a thousand other remarkable Circum∣stances, which it would be too long to particularize.</P>
<P>This great News, which was con∣firmed by a Courier, whom the Prince <HI>de Waldeck</HI> dispatcht expresly to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> put at first all the Officers of War, who desired only matter to employ their Valour, into unimaginable Transports of Joy. Every one figured to himself all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> reunited against <HI>France;</HI> they represented to themselves with plea∣sure so many Outrages revenged, so
<PB N="173" REF="89"/> many Attempts happily executed, so many unfortunate Princes reestablisht in their Estates; and in fine, every one in particular built himself a For∣tune according to the Grandeur of his Courage; when all of a sudden, they fell from a great Hope to a just Apprehension, that this great Success would bring rather Peace than War. Those who were of this Sentiment, alledged for their Reasons, That Peace not being yet made with the <HI>Turk,</HI> none would refuse to treat, if <HI>France</HI> departed from her Pretensions, which it was to be presumed she would do in the Fear she ought to have, lest, this Peace being made, all <HI>Europe</HI> should fall upon her: that one Mark of her having been always willing to reserve to her self this Back-door, is, that she had not yet attempted any thing, altho it were near a Month since she entred into <HI>Flanders:</HI> that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who were as it were the Soul of all the Party, would not have War, unless they were obliged thereunto by indis∣pensible Necessity; and that they
<PB N="174" REF="90"/> should no sooner see an Opportunity of being able to continue in repose, but they would embrace it with plea∣sure: that the others could do no∣thing without them: and that, in one word, the common Interest of Chri∣stendom set aside, it had been more advantagious for them that <HI>Vienna</HI> had been taken than relieved.</P>
<P>These Reasons were indeed strong; but there were opposed unto them o∣thers, which were no less strong: For hereunto it was answered, That altho Peace were not yet made with the <HI>Turk,</HI> there was nevertheless all reason to believe that it would in∣cessantly be made, it having been the Policy of the <HI>Turks</HI> to treat as soon as ever they were once beaten: That if the <HI>French</HI> had not yet attempted any thing, it was not so much to ex∣pect what would arrive from <HI>Vienna,</HI> as to leave some impression of their Moderation, pretending thereby, that <HI>Vienna</HI> being taken, the Empire, whereof they aimed to make them∣selves Masters, would call them in to
<PB N="175" REF="90"/> its Assistance, which would facilitate the means of their accomplishing their Designs: That now they were fallen from all these Pretensions, there was nothing more left them but to assert their Claim by Arms, which they were too glorious not to do: That the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> of whose Courage they seemed willing to enter into distrust, had reason to complain, that after having alone, as they had done, em∣braced the Defence of <HI>Flanders,</HI> they should be thought to be such slender Politicians, as not to lay hold of an Occasion which was so favourable to them, to make a Crown, whose Neighbourhood they ought so much to apprehend, to give up what he had swallowed: That, in fine, they were too wise, and too illuminated, not to see, that altho <HI>France</HI> should even incline to some Peace, it would be only a daubed-up Peace, such as have been those she has made these fifteen or twenty Years.</P>
<P>It remains now to examine which of these two seemed to have the
<PB N="176" REF="91"/> greater Reason, but methinks it is not very difficult to conclude in be∣half of the latter: For altho there be nothing to be added to their Rea∣sons, I shall say however, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who would easily have yielded to any Conditions of Peace in case <HI>Vienna</HI> had been taken, will now grow stiff, since they hope to be sup∣ported by <HI>Germany,</HI> which on her side will be very glad, after she shall have made Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> to free her self from the <HI>French</HI> Domi∣nation. However it be, the Victory which the Christians have gained, cannot but have good Effects; for whether we have Peace or War, we ought to hope for an happy Issue, and that one way or other we shall find means to mortify a Crown, which begins a little too much to mis-under∣stand it self.</P>
