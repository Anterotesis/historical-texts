<HEAD>A Taylors Bill, with few or no <HI>Items:</HI> by or for <HI>John Taylor.</HI></HEAD>
<L>NOw in the seventy fourth yeare of mine Age,</L>
<L>I take an <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welsh</HI> Pilgrimage:</L>
<L>From <HI>London</HI> first I bend my course to <HI>Chester,</HI></L>
<L>And humbly I to all men am Requester;</L>
<L>That when I have past over Hills and Dales,</L>
<L>And compast with my Travels famous <HI>Wales,</HI></L>
<L>That when to you that I a Book do give,</L>
<L>Relating how I did subsist and live,</L>
<L>With all my Passages both here and there,</L>
<L>And of my Entertainment every where.</L>
<L>Write but your Names and Dwellings in this Bill,</L>
<L>I'le finde you, for the Book give what you will.</L>
<L>Twelve Voyages and Journies I have past,</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="commentary">
<P>IN this Bill I did promise to give to my friends (Subscribers) a true Relation of my Journey,

<HEAD>A Short Relation of a Long Iourny, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<L>A Traveller that loves to see strange Lands,</L>
<L>May be a man or not a man of 's hands:</L>
<L>But yet 'tis very requisite and meet,</L>
<L>He should be furnish'd with good brains and feet;</L>
<L>For he that wants legs, feet, and brains, and wit,</L>
<L>To be a Traveller is most unfit:</L>
<L>And such am I by Age of strength bereft,</L>
<L>With one right leg, and one lame left leg left.</L>
<L>Beggers on their backs their brats do reare;</L>
<L>But I my issue in my leg do beare:</L>
<L>I dresse it often and impatiently</L>
<L>It lies and cries not, though it make me cry;</L>
<L>Yet I dare challenge Scottish <HI>Jock</HI> or <HI>Jackey,</HI></L>
<L>Or any light-heel'd nimble footed Lackey,</L>
<L>To travell such a Jaunt as I have done,</L>
<L>With th' right leg going, and the left leg run:</L>
<L>Or if I please, the case I'le alter so,</L>
<L>To make the worst leg run, the best to goe.</L>
<L>And sure my heart was stout, men may suppose,</L>
<L>To venture Travell with such legs as those.</L>
<L>But there be some few that do understand,</L>
<L>'Tis merry walking with a horse in hand.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>Such was my Lot, I had a stately Courser,</L>
<L>None courser quality'd, and for a worser,</L>
<L>There's neither <HI>Halifax,</HI> or <HI>Hull,</HI> nor <HI>Hell,</HI></L>
<L>That for good parts my horse can parallel;</L>
<L>He was a beast, had heated been and cheated,</L>
<L>Too much hard over rid and under meated,</L>
<L>That he as gaunt as any Greyhound was,</L>
<L>And for a Horses Skelliton might passe:</L>
<L>You might have told his ribs, he was so thin,</L>
<L>And seen his heart and guts, but for his skin;</L>
<L>He was not pursie foggy, cloy'd with greace,</L>
<L>And like his Rider lov'd rest, ease, and peace:</L>
<L><HI>Dun</HI> was, and is the Dumb beast, and was Done,</L>
<L>E're I begun, or he with me begun.</L>
<L>He had a black List, from the Mane to Taile,</L>
<L>Which is a colour that doth seldome faile:</L>
<L>To change of paces he had been inur'd,</L>
<L>But yet not one t'endure, or be endur'd;</L>
<L>His Trot would fling a Dagger out ot'h sheath,</L>
<L>Or jolt a man to death, or out of breath.</L>
<L>His Ambling was invisible to me,</L>
<L>From such smooth easie garbs his feet were free:</L>
<L>His common Pace in Sun-shine or in showre,</L>
<L>Was (as he pleas'd) about two mile an houre.</L>
<L>I never yet could put him in a sweat,</L>
<L>For he was never free, but at his meat.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>John</HI> upon <HI>Dun's</HI> back, were both <HI>Dun John,</HI></L>
<L>And thus the tedious way we wandred on.</L>
<L>Now to proceed in order duly, truly,</L>
<L>I <HI>London</HI> left the thirteenth day of <HI>July:</HI></L>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>The Wayes as faire as man could well desire,</L>
<L>'Cause I had none to <HI>draw Dun out o'th mire:</HI></L>
<L>I fifteen miles (to <HI>Rislip</HI>) that day went,</L>
<L>Baited at <HI>Edgworth,</HI> to give <HI>Dun</HI> content;</L>
<L>There my acquaintance, of good fame and worth,</L>
<L>Did welcome me: the next day I set forth,</L>
<L>With Boots, <HI>Sans</HI> Spurs, with Whip, and Switch of Burch,</L>
<L>I got on, twenty miles to <HI>Stoken</HI> Church:</L>
<L>The fifteenth day, S. <HI>Swithin,</HI> I and <HI>Dun,</HI></L>
<L>Did shuffle sixteen miles to <HI>Abington;</HI></L>
<L>There till the Tuesday following I abode,</L>
<L>From thence I sixteen miles to great <HI>Tue</HI> rode,</L>
<L>There at the <HI>Swan</HI> mine Host was free and kind,</L>
<L>He had but one eye, tother side was blinde;</L>
<L>But surely he a right Good-fellow was,</L>
<L>And there one night my <HI>Dun</HI> did eat good grass.</L>
<L>On <HI>July's</HI> twenty one from <HI>Tue</HI> I went,</L>
<L>And unto <HI>Warwick</HI> strait my course I bent,</L>
<L>There did I find another signe o'th <HI>Swan,</HI></L>
<L>Mine Hostesse kind, mine Host a Gentile man,</L>
<L>And for your love to me, good Master <HI>Venner,</HI></L>
<L>With humble thanks I am your praises Penner.</L>
<L>My gratitude to Master <HI>Jacob Harmer,</HI></L>
<L>His Drapers shop could never make me warmer,</L>
<L>Then high and mighty <HI>Warwick's</HI> drink did there,</L>
<L>It made my brains to Caper and careere,</L>
<L>It was of such invincible strong force,</L>
<L>To knock me (in five miles) twice from my Horse:</L>
<L>And sure I think the Drink was certainly</L>
<L>Infused with the conqu'ring ghost of <HI>Guy.</HI></L>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<L>On <HI>July's</HI> two and twentieth day I came</L>
<L>Ʋnto an ancient house call'd <HI>Hunningham,</HI></L>
<L>There were two Ladies of good Worth and fame,</L>
<L>Whom for some reasons I forbeare to name:</L>
<L>Their Son and Grandson <HI>(John)</HI> I'le not forget,</L>
<L>He's nobly minded as a Baronet;</L>
<L>Foure dayes they kept me with exceeding cheere,</L>
<L>And gave me silver because Travels deare.</L>
<L>From thence my Journey <HI>5</HI> miles I pursue,</L>
<L>To <HI>Coventry,</HI> most samous for true blew;</L>
<L>There the faire Crosse of ancient high Renown</L>
<L>Stands firme, though other Crosses all are down.</L>
<L>'Tis a dry City, and dry let it be,</L>
<L>'Twas not made dryer one small drop for me:</L>
<L>Like a Camelion there I brake my fast,</L>
<L>And thence I twenty miles to <HI>Lichfield</HI> past;</L>
<L>There at the <HI>George</HI> I took my lodging up,</L>
<L>I well was lodg'd, and well did sup and cup,</L>
<L>When there by chance, I cast my wandring eyon</L>
<L>The ruin'd Church, with griefe I thought on <HI>Sion:</HI></L>
<L>I sigh'd to see that sad confusion,</L>
<L>Like th' <HI>Hebrews</HI> by the Brook of <HI>Babylon.</HI></L>
<L>On <HI>July's</HI> twenty seventh I rode alone</L>
<L>Full sixteen miles unto a Town call'd <HI>Stone.</HI></L>
<L>Next day to <HI>Nantwich</HI> sixteen long miles more,</L>
<L>From thence to <HI>Chester</HI> near the <HI>Cambrian</HI> shore:</L>
<L>There was my welcome in such noble fashion,</L>
<L>Of which in Prose I'le make some briefe Relation.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="narrative">
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<P>MY Lodging at <HI>Chester</HI> was in the Watergate street, at the Sign of the Feathers, I lay on a Feather-bed, and in the same house I met with two Brothers of mine acquaintance thirty years, they brought me to the Chamber of a Reverend <HI>Italian</HI> Physition, named <HI>Vincent Lancelles</HI> he was more then 80 yeares of Age, yet of a very able body, and vigorous constitution: The Yong mens Names were <HI>Thomas Morrine</HI> and <HI>Francis Morrine,</HI> the people were pleased (out of their Ignorance, or in small Wit) to call the old Gen∣tleman a Mountebank; but I am sure he was deservedly well reputed and reported of, for ma∣ny Malladies and Diseases which hee cured, whereof divers were judged incurable: He help∣ed such as were grieved for three severall consi∣derations.</P>
<P>First, Hee cured the Rich, for as much as hee could get.</P>
<P>Secondly, Hee healed the Meaner sort for what they could spare, or were willing to part withall.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Hee cured the Poor for Gods sake, and gave them mony and other reliefe, as I my selfe (with thankfull experience) must ever ac∣knowledge: For he looked upon my lame leg, and applyed such Medicine, as did not only ease me, but I am in hope will cure me, the griefe be∣ing nothing but a Blast of Lightning and Thun∣der, or Planet stroke, which I received nine years <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<P>For a further courtesie, when I was taking my leave of <HI>Chester,</HI> I demanded what I had to pay for Lodging, Dyet, and Horse-meat, mine Host sayd, that all was fully payd and satisfied by the Good old Physition. My humble thanks remembred to Captain <HI>Vincent Corbet,</HI> but more especially to Captain <HI>John Whitworth</HI> at <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>On Fryday the 30. of <HI>July,</HI> I rode (and footed it) ten Miles to <HI>Flint</HI> (which is the Shire Town of Flint-shire) and surely War hath made it mi∣serable, the sometimes famous Castle there, in which <HI>Richard</HI> the Second of that Name, King of <HI>England</HI> was surprised by <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullinbrook,</HI> is now almost buried in it's own Ruins, and the Town is so spoiled, that it may truely be said of it, that they never had any Market (in the me∣mory of man) they have no Sadler, Taylor, Weaver, Brewer, Baker, Botcher, or Button∣maker; they have not so much as a signe of an Ale-house, so that I was doubtfull of a Lodging, but (by good hap) I hapned into the house of one Mr. <HI>Edward Griffith,</HI> where I had good meat and lodging for me and my dumb <HI>Dun</HI> Beast, for very reasonable consideration, and this (me thinks) is a pitifull discription of a Shire Town.</P>
<P>Saturday, the last of <HI>July,</HI> I left <HI>Flint,</HI> and went three miles to <HI>Holy-well,</HI> of which place I must speak somewhat materially: About the length of a furlong, down a very steep Hill, is a Well (full of wonder and admiration) it comes
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>from a Spring not far from <HI>Rudland</HI> Castle; it is and hath been many hundred yeares knowne by the name of <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> but it is more common∣ly and of most Antiquity called Saint <HI>Winifrids</HI> Well, in memory of the pious and chaste Virgin <HI>Winifrid,</HI> who was there beheaded for refusing to yield her Chastity to the furious lust of a Pagan Prince; in that very place where her bloud was shed, this Spring sprang up; from it doth issue so forceible a stream, that within a hundred yards of it, it drives certain Mils, and some do say that nine Corn Mils and Fulling Mils are driven with the stream of that Spring: It hath a fair Chap∣pell erected over it called Saint <HI>Winifrids</HI> Chap∣pell, which is now much defaced by the injury of these late Wars: The well is compassed a∣bout with a fine Wall of Free stone, the Wall hath eight Angles or Corners, and at every An∣gle is a fair Stone Piller, whereon the West end of the Chappell is supported. In two severall places of the Wall, there are neat stone staires to go into the water that comes from the Well, for it is to be noted that the Well it selfe doth continually work and bubble with extream vio∣lence, like a boiling Cauldron or Furnace, and within the Wall, or into the Well very few do enter: The Water is Christalline, sweet, and medicinable, it is frequented daily by many peo∣ple of Rich and Poore, of all Discases, amongst which great store of folkes are cured, divers are
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>cased, but none made the worse. The Hill des∣cending is plentifully furnished (on both sides of the way) with Beggers of all ages, sexes, condi∣tions, sorts and sizes, many of them are impo∣tent, but all are impudent, and richly embrode∣red all over with such Hexameter poudred <HI>Er∣mins</HI> (or Vermin) as are called Lice in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Monday, the second of <HI>August,</HI> when the Day begun, I mounted my <HI>Dun,</HI> having hired a little Boy (to direct me in the way) that could speak no English, and for lack of an Interpreter, we travelled speachless eight miles, to <HI>Rudland,</HI> where is an old ruined winde and war-shaken Castle; from that Town, after my Horse, and the Boy, and my selfe had dined with Hay, Oats, and <HI>Barraw Causs,</HI> we hors't and footed it twelve miles further, to a fine strong walled Towne, named <HI>Aberconwy;</HI> there I lodged at the house of one Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> (an English man) he is Post-Master there, and there my entertainment was good, and my Reckoning reasonable: There is a good defensive Castle which I would have seen, but because there was a Garrison, I was loath to give occasion of offence, or be much inquisi∣tive.</P>
<Q><L>The next day when the Clock strook two and fowre,</L>
<L>I mounted <HI>Dun, Dun</HI> mounted <HI>Penmen Mawre;</HI></L>
<L>And if I do not take my aime amisse,</L>
<L>That lofty Mountain seems the Skies to kisse:</L>
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
<L>But there are other Hils accounted higher,</L>
<L>Whose lofty tops I had no mind t' aspire:</L>
<L>As <HI>Snowdon,</HI> and the tall <HI>Plinnillimon,</HI></L>
<L>Which I no stomack had to tread upon.</L>
<L><HI>Merioneth</HI> Mountains, and Shire <HI>Cardigan</HI></L>
<L>To travell over, will tire horse and man:</L>
<L>I, to <HI>Bewmaris</HI> came that day and din'd,</L>
<L>Where I the good Lord <HI>Buckley,</HI> thought to find.</L>
<L>But he to speak with me had no intent,</L>
<L>Dry I came into's house, dry out I went.</L>
<L>I left <HI>Bewmaris,</HI> and to <HI>Bangor</HI> trac'd it,</L>
<L>Ther's a brave Church, but Time and War defac'd it:</L>
<L>For Love and Mony I was welcome thither,</L>
<L>'Tis merry meeting when they come together.</L></Q>
<P>Thus having travelled from <HI>Aberconwy</HI> to <HI>Beu∣morris</HI> and to <HI>Bangor,</HI> Tuesday 3. <HI>August,</HI> which in all they are pleased to call 14 miles, but most of the Welsh miles are large <HI>London</HI> measure, not any one of them but hath a hand bredth or small cantle at each end, by which means, what they want in broadness, they have it in length; besides the ascending and descending almost im∣passable mountains, and Break-neck stony ways, doth make such Travellers as my selfe, judge that they were no Misers in measuring their miles; besides, the land is courser then it is in most parts about <HI>London,</HI> which makes them to afford the larger measure: for course Broad∣cloath is not at the rate of Velvet or Satten.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
<P>Wednesday the 4. of <HI>August</HI> I rode 8 miles from <HI>Bangor</HI> to <HI>Carnarvan,</HI> where I thought to have seen a Town and a Castle, or a Castle and a Town; but I saw both to be one, and one to be both; for indeed a man can hardly divide them in judgement or apprehension; and I have seen many gallant Fabricks and Fortifications, but for compactness and compleatness of <HI>Caer∣narvon,</HI> I never yet saw a parallell. And it is by Art and Nature so sited and seated, that it stands impregnable, &amp; if it be well mand, victu∣alled, and ammunitioned, it is invincible, except fraud or famine do assault, or conspire against it.</P>
<P>I was 5. hours in <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> and when I thought that I had taken my leave for ever of it, then was I meerly deceived; for when I was a mile on my way, a Trooper came galloping af∣ter me, and enforced me back to be examined by Colonell <HI>Thomas Mason,</HI> (the Governour there) who after a few words, when hee heard my name, and knew my occasions, he used me so re∣spectively and bountifully, that (at his charge) I stayd all night, and by the means of him, and one Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> (a Justice of Peace there) I was furnished with a Guide, and something else to bear charges for one weeks travaile; for which curtesies, if I were not thankfull, I were worth the hanging for being ingratefull.</P>
<P>The 5. of August I went 12. miles, to a place
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>called <HI>Climenie,</HI> where the Noble Sure <HI>John Owen</HI> did, with liberall welcome, entertain me.</P>
<P>The 6. day I rode to a Town called <HI>Harleck,</HI> which stands on a high barren Mountaine, very uneasie for the ascending into, by reason of the steep and uneeven stony way; this Town had neither hay, grass, oats, or any relief for a horse: there stands a strong Castle, but the Town is all spoild, and almost inhabitable by the late la∣mentable troubles.</P>
<P>So I left that Towne (for fear of starving my Horse) and came to a place called <HI>Bermoth,</HI> (12. miles that day, as narrow as 20.) That place was so plentifully furnished with want of provi∣sion, that it was able to famish 100. men and horses: I procured a brace of Boyes to goe two miles to cut grasse for my <HI>Dun,</HI> for which I gave them two groats; for my selfe and Guide, I pur∣chased a Hen boyld with Bacon, as yellow as the Cowslip, or Gold Noble. My course Lodging there, was at the homely House of one <HI>John Thomson,</HI> a Lancashire English man.</P>
<P>Saturday the 7. of August, I Horst, footed, (and crawling upon all 4.) 10. slender miles to <HI>Aberdovy,</HI> which was the last lodging that I had in Merionethshire, where was the best en∣tertainment for men, but almost as bad as the worst for horses in all <HI>Merionethshire.</HI></P>
<P>August 9. I gat into <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> to a mise∣rable Market Town called <HI>Aberistwith,</HI> where,
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>before the late troubles, there stood a strong Ca∣stle, which being blown up, fell down, and ma∣ny fair Houses (with a defensible thick Wall a∣bout the Town) are transformed into confused heaps of unnecessary Rubbidge: within foure miles of this Town, are the silver Mines, which were honorable and profitable, as long as my good friend <HI>Thomas Bushell</HI> Esquire, had the ma∣naging of them, who was most industrious in the work, and withall by his noble demeanour, and affable deportment, deservedly gain'd the generall love and affection of all the Countrey, of all degrees of people: but since he hath left that important imployment, the Mines are neg∣lected.</P>
<P>From <HI>Aberistwith,</HI> I went to the House of Sir <HI>Richard Price,</HI> Knight and Baronet, where my entertainment was freely welcome, with some expression of further curtesies at my departure, for which I humbly thank the noble Knight, not forgetting my gratefull remembrance to Mr. <HI>Thomas Evans</HI> there: that whole dayes journey being 9. miles.</P>
<P>Tuesday the 10. of August, having hired a Guide, for I that knew neither the intricate wayes, nor could speake any of the Language, was necessitated to have Guides from place to place, and it being Harvest time, I was forced to pay exceeding deare for Guiding; so that some dayes I payd 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> sometimes 3. besides bearing
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>their charges of meat and drinke and lodging; for it is to bee understood that those kind of la∣bouring people had rather reap hard all the day for six pence, then to go ten or twelve miles easi∣ly on foot for two shillings. That day, after six∣teen miles travell, I came to the house of an ancient worthy and hospitable Gentleman, na∣med <HI>Sure Walter Lloyd,</HI> he was noble in bountifull house-keeping, and in his generositie, caused his horse to be saddled, and the next day hee rode three miles to <HI>Conway,</HI> and shewd me the way to <HI>Caermarden,</HI> which they do call 18 small miles, but I had rather ride 30 of such miles as are in many parts of <HI>England;</HI> the way continu∣ally hilly, or mountainous and stony, insomuch that I was forced to alight and walke 30 times, and when the Sun was near setting, I having foure long miles to go, and knew no part of the way, was resolved to take my lodging in a Reeke of Oats in the field, to which purpose, as I rode out of the stony way towards my field-chamber, my Horse and I found a softer bed, for we were both in a Bog, or Quagmire, and at that time I had much ado to draw myselfe out of the dirt, or my poore weary <HI>Dun</HI> out if the Mire.</P>
<P>I being in this hard strait, having night (of Gods sending,) Owl-light to guide me, no tongue to aske a question, the way unknown, or uneven; I held it my best course to grope in the hard sto∣ny way againe, which having found, (after a
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>quarter of an houres melancholy paces) a Hors∣man of <HI>Wales,</HI> that could speak English, overtook me and brought me to <HI>Caermarden,</HI> where I found good and free entertainment at the house of one Mistris <HI>Oakley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caermarden,</HI> the shire Town of <HI>Caermardenshire,</HI> is a good large Town, with a defencible strong Castle, and a reasonable Haven for small Barks and Boats, which formerly was for the use of good Ships, but now it is much impedimented with Shelvs, Sands, and other annoyances: It is said that <HI>Merlyn</HI> the Prophet was born there; it is one of the plentifullest Townes that ever I set foot in, for very fair Egs are cheaper then small Pears; for, as near as I can remember, I will set down at what rates victuals was there.</P>
<P>Butter, as good as the world affords, two pence halfe penny, or three pence the pound.</P>
<P>A Salmon two foot and a halfe long, twelve pence.</P>
<P>Biefe, three halfe pence the pound.</P>
<P>Oysters, a penny the hundred.</P>
<P>Egs, twelve for a penny.</P>
<P>Peares, six for a penny.</P>
<P>And all manner of Fish and Flesh at such low prices, that a little money will buy much, for there is nothing scarce, dear, or hard to come by, but Tobacco pipes.</P>
<P>My humble thanks to the Governour there, to <HI>William Guinn</HI> of <HI>Talliaris,</HI> Esquire; to <HI>Sure
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>Henry Vaughan;</HI> and to all the rest, with the good woman mine Hostess.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Pembrookshire,</HI> the people do speak English in it almost generally, and therefore they call it little <HI>England</HI> beyond <HI>Wales,</HI> it being the farthest South and West County in the whole Principality: The Shire Town, <HI>Pembrook,</HI> hath been in better estate, for as it is now, some hou∣ses down, some standing, and many without In∣habitants; the Castle there hath been strong, large, stately, and impregnable, able to hold out any enemy, except hunger, it being founded up∣on a lofty Rock, gives a brave prospect a far off: <HI>Tenby</HI> Towne and Castle being somewhat near, or eight miles from it, seems to be more usefull and considerable. My thanks to Mistris <HI>Powell</HI> at the <HI>Hart</HI> there.</P>
<P><HI>Tenby</HI> hath a good Castle and a Haven, but in respect of <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, all the Havens under the Heavens are inconsiderable, for it is of such length, bredth, and depth, that 1000. Ships may ride safely in it in all weathers, and by reason of the hills that do inclose it, and the windings and turnings of the Haven from one poynt of land to another, it is conjectured that 1500 ships may ride there, and not scarce one of them can see another. The Haven hath in it 16 Creekes, 5 Bayes, and 13 Rodes, of large capacity, and all these are known by severall names.</P>
<P>The goodly Church of S. <HI>Davids</HI> hath beene
<PB N="20" REF="11"/>forced lately to put off the dull and heavy coat of peacefull Lead, which was metamorphosed into warlike bullets. In that Church lies inter∣red <HI>Edmund</HI> Earle of <HI>Richmond,</HI> Father to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, for whose sake his Grandson (K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eight) did spare it from defacing, when hee spared not much that belonged to the Church.</P>
<P>Thus having gone and riden many miles, with too many turning and winding Mountains, stony turning waies, forward, backward, sidewaies, circular, and semicircular, upon the 17. of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> I rode to the house of the right Honourable, <HI>Richard Vaughan</HI> Earle of <HI>Karbery,</HI> at a place cal∣led <HI>Golden Grove;</HI> and surely that house, with the faire Fields, Woods, Walks, and pleasant scituation, may not onely be rightly called the <HI>Golden Grove,</HI> but it may without fiction be justly stiled the <HI>Cambrian</HI> Paradise, and <HI>Elizium</HI> of <HI>Wales;</HI> but that which grac'd it totally, was the nobleness, and affable presence and deportment of the Earle, with his faire and vertuous new married Countess, the beautifull Lady <HI>Alice,</HI> or <HI>Alicia,</HI> daughter to the right Honourable the late Earle of <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> deccased: I humbly thank them both, for they were pleased to Ho∣nour me so much, that I supp'd with them, at which time a Gentleman came in, who being sate, did relate a strange discourse of a violent ram which fell on the mountains in part of <HI>Rad∣norshire,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="11"/>and into <HI>Glomorganshire;</HI> the story was, as near as I can remember, as followeth:</P>
<P>That on Saturday the 17. of <HI>July</HI> last, 1652. there fell a sudden showre of rain in the Coun∣ties aforesaid, as if an Ocean had flowed from the Clouds to overwhelm and drown the moun∣tains, it poured down with such violent impe∣tuositie, that it tumbled down divers houses of stone that stood in the way of it; it drowned many Cattell and Sheep, bore all before it as it ran, therefore a poore man with his son and daughter forsook their house, and the father and son climed up into a tree for their safety, in the mean time the merciless waters took hold of the poore maid, and most furiously bare her away, down betwen two mountains, rolling and hurling her against many great stones, till at last it threw her near the side of the stream, and her hair and hair-lace being loose, it catched hold of a stump of an old thorn bush, by which means she was stayed, being almost dead; but as she lay in this misery, she saw a sad and la∣mentable sight, for the water had fiercely un∣rooted the tree, and bore it down the streame, with her father and brother, who were both un∣fortunately drowned: the Maid, as I was cer∣tified, is like to live and recover.</P>
<P>My humble thanks to the good yong hopefull Lord <HI>Vaughan,</HI> and to all the rest of the Noble Olive Branches of that most Worthy Tree of
<PB N="22" REF="12"/>Honour, their Father, not omitting or yet for∣getting my gratitude to Mr. <HI>Steward</HI> there, with∣all the rest of the Gentlemen and servants at∣tendant, with my love to Mr. <HI>Thomas Ryve,</HI> un∣known, and so <HI>Golden Grove</HI> farewell.</P>
<P>The 18. of <HI>August,</HI> I hired a Guide who brought me to <HI>Swansey</HI> (16 well stretch'd Welch Mountainous Miles) where I was cordially welcome to an Ancient Worthy Gentleman, <HI>Waker Thomas</HI> Esquire, for whose Love and Li∣berality I am much obliged to him and the good Gentlewoman his Wife; he staid me till the next day after Diner, and then sent his man with me a mile to his Sons house, named <HI>William Tho∣mas</HI> Esquire: There, as soone as I had rewar∣ded my Guide he slip'd from me, leaving me to the mercy of the House, where I found neither mercy nor manners; for the good Gentleman and his Wife were both rode from home; and though there were people old enough, and big enough, yet there was not one kind enough, or good enough to do me the least kind of courte∣sie or friendship; they did not so much as bid me come into the house, or offer me a cup of drink; they all scornfully wondred at me, like so ma∣ny Buzzards and Woodcocks about an Owle, there was a shotten thin scul'd shallow brain'd simpleton fellow, that answered me, that he was a stranger there, but I believed him not, by rea∣son of his familiarity with the rest of the folks,
<PB N="23" REF="12"/>there was also a single-soal'd Gentlewoman, of the last Edition, who would vouchsafe me not one poor glance of her eye-beams, to whom I said as followeth.</P>
<P>Fair Gentlewoman, I was sent hither by the Father of the Gentleman of this House, to whom I have a Letter from a Gentleman of his fami∣liar acquaintance; I am sure that the Owner of this Place is famed and reported to be a man en∣dowed with all affability and courtesie to stran∣gers as is every way accommodating to a Gen∣tleman of Worth and Quality; and that if I were but a meer stranger to him, yet his Gene∣rosity would not suffer me to be harbourless, but by reason of his Fathers sending his servant with me, and a Friends Letter, I sayd that if Mr. <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> had been at home I should be better enter∣tained.</P>
<P>To which Mrs. <HI>Pumpkins</HI> looking scornfully, ascue over her shoulders, answered me with <HI>(it may be so)</HI> then most uncurteous Mistris, quoth I, I doubt I must bee necessitated to take up my lodging in the Field: To which the said ungen∣tle Gentlewoman (with her posteriors, or butt end towards me) gave me a finall Answer, that I might if I would.</P>
<P>Whereupon I was enraged and mounted my <HI>Dun,</HI> and in a friendly maner I tooke my leave, saying, that I would wander further and try my fortune, and that if my stay at that house, that
<PB N="24" REF="13"/>night, would save either Mr. <HI>Shallow-pate,</HI> or Mrs. <HI>Jullock</HI> from hanging, that I would rather lie, and venture all hazards that are incident to Horse, Man, or Traveller, then to be beholding to such unmanerly Mungrils.</P>
<P>Thus desperately I shaked them off, that would not take me on, and riding I knew not whither, with a wide wild Heath under me, and a wider Firmament above me. I roade at ad∣venture, betwixt light and darkness, about a mile, when luckily a Gentleman overtook mee, and after a little talk of my distresse and travail, he bad me be of good chear, for he would bring me to a lodging and entertainment; in which promise he was better then his word, for hee brought mee to a pretty Market Towne called <HI>Neath,</HI> where he spent his money upon me; for which kindness I thank him. But one Doctour (as they call him) <HI>Rice Jones,</HI> (or Doctor <HI>Merri∣man</HI>) came and supt with mee, and very kindly payd all the reckoning. That dayes journey be∣ing but 6 miles sterling.</P>
<P>The 19. of August I hired a Guide for 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> (16 miles) to a place called <HI>Penline,</HI> where somtime stood a strong Castle, which is now ruined; ad∣joyning to it, or in the place of it, is a fair house, belonging to <HI>Anthony Turberville</HI> Esquire, where although the Gentleman was from home, the good Gentlewoman, his Wife, did with hospi∣table and noble kindnesse, bid me welcome.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="13"/>
<P>Fryday, the 20. of <HI>August,</HI> I rode a mile to an Ancient Town, named <HI>Coobridge,</HI> from whence I scrambled two miles further to <HI>Llanstrithyott,</HI> where the Noble Gentleman Sure <HI>John Awbrey,</HI> with his Vertuous Lady kept me three dayes, in the mean space I rode two miles to the house of the Ancient and Honorable Knight, Sir <HI>Thomas Lewis</HI> at <HI>Penmark,</HI> to whom and his good Lady, I humbly dedicate my gratitude: The same day after Dinner, I returned back to <HI>Llanstrithyott,</HI> which was to me a second Golden Grove, or Welch Paradice, for Building, Scituation, whol∣some Ayre, Pleasure and Plenty, for my free en∣tertainment there, with the Noble expression of the Gentlemans Bounty at my departure, I heartily do wish to him and his, with all the rest of my Honorable and Noble, Worshipfull and friendly Benefactors, true peace and happinesse, internall, externall, and eternall.</P>
<P>Monday, the 23. of <HI>August,</HI> I rode eight miles to the good Town of <HI>Cardiffe,</HI> where I was wel∣come to Mr. <HI>Aaron Price,</HI> the Town Clark there, with whom I dined, at his cost and my perrill, after Dinner he directed me two miles further, to a place called <HI>Llanrumney,</HI> where a right true bred generous Gentleman, <HI>Thomas Morgan</HI> Es∣quire, gave me such loving and liberall enter∣tainment, for which I cannot be so thankfull as the merit of it requires.</P>
<P>Tuesday, being both Saint <HI>Bartholomews</HI> Day,
<PB N="26" REF="14"/>my Birth day, the 24, of the Month, and the ve∣ry next day before Wednesday, I arose betimes, and travelled to a Town called <HI>Newport,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Carbean,</HI> and lastly to <HI>Ʋske,</HI> in all 15 well measu'd Welsh <HI>Monmouthshire</HI> miles: at <HI>Uske</HI> I lodg'd at an Inne, the house of one Master <HI>Powell.</HI></P>
<P>The 25. of <HI>August</HI> I rode but 12 miles, by an unlook'd for accident, I found <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Faire at <HI>Monmouth,</HI> a hundred miles from Smithfield; there I stayed two nights upon the large reckon∣ing of Nothing to pay, for which I humbly thank my Hospitable Host, and Hostess, Master <HI>Reignald Rowse</HI> and his good Wife.</P>
<P><HI>Monmouth,</HI> the Shire Town of <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI> was the last Welsh ground that I left behind me: <HI>August</HI> 27. I came to <HI>Glocester,</HI> where though I was born there, very few did know me; I was almost as ignorant as he that knew no body: my lodging there was at the signe of the <HI>George,</HI> at the house of my Namesake, Master <HI>John Tay∣lor,</HI> from whence on Saturday the 28. I rode 16. miles to <HI>Barnsley.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the places in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> that I have travelled to, this Village of <HI>Barnsley</HI> doth most strictly observe the Lords day, or Sunday, for little children are not suffered to walke or play: and two Women who had beene at Church both before and after Noone, did but walke into the fields for their recreation,
<PB N="27" REF="14"/>and they were put to their choice, either to pay sixpence apiece (for prophane walking,) or to be laid one houre in the stocks; and the pievish willfull women (though they were able enough to pay) to save their money and jest out the matter, lay both by the heeles merrily one houre.</P>
<P>There is no such zeale in many places and Pa∣rishes in <HI>Wales;</HI> for they have neither Service, Prayer, Sermon, Minister, or Preacher, nor any Church door opened at all, so that people do exercise and edifie in the Church-Yard, at the lawfull and laudable Games of Trap, Catt, Stool-ball, Racket, &amp;c. on Sundayes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Barnsley</HI> on Monday the 30. of <HI>August,</HI> I rode 30 miles to <HI>Abington,</HI> from thence, &amp;c. to <HI>London,</HI> where I brought both ends together on Tuesday the 7. of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>Those that are desirous to know more of <HI>Wales,</HI> let them either travell for it as I have done, or read Mr. <HI>Camdens Brittania,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Speeds</HI> labo∣rious History, and their Geographicall Maps and Descriptions will give them more ample, or contenting satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>Cambria Brittania: <HI>OR,</HI> Ashort Abreviation of the History, and Chro∣nicles of <HI>VVALES.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> JOHN TAYLOR.</BYLINE>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>ARADOC</HI> of <HI>Lancarvan,</HI> (a studious Antiquary, and a learned diligent Collector of the Successions and Acts of the Brittish Princes) did write the History of <HI>Wales,</HI> from the time and Raigne of <HI>Cadwallador,</HI> who lived in the yeare of our Re∣demption, 685, and continued the said Chrono∣logy near 500 years, till the Raigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the second King of <HI>England.</HI> It hath alwayes before those times, and ever since, that Writers for feare, or flattery, or profit, have used shamefull (or shameless) partiality, in publishing the fames of their owne Princes, and Countrey, above measure, and beyond truth; but in their detra∣cting and traducing others, they have been too liberall; and in relating their Valour, Vertues, or Injuries of such they fancyed not, they have been too sparing, or wilfully negligent.</P>
<P>But to make bold and speak the truth, it is
<PB N="30" REF="16"/>worth good consideration, to know what reason the <HI>English</HI> had to make Warr against the <HI>Welsh; Wales</HI> had ever been a free Countrey, not subject to any Prince, except their own; they owed no Homage or Alegiance neither to <HI>England,</HI> or to any other Crowne, or State; their Language, Lawes, and Customs, were of their own institu∣tions, to which Lawes both Prince and people were subject; they lived quietly upon their owne, and they never went forth of their owne bounds to rob the <HI>English,</HI> or to spoile and invade <HI>England,</HI> or any other Nation. Then the que∣stion is with much ease proposed and answered. What cause did the <HI>Welsh</HI> give to the <HI>English</HI> to make Warre upon them, to invade, plunder, spoile, and kill? the Answer is, or may be, Be∣cause the <HI>English</HI> were ambitious, and covetous, and also stronger then their Neighbours, and being able and willing to do injury, and oppress the <HI>Welsh,</HI> they many times attempted to sub∣ject and conquer them; and they (on the other side) did manfully resist, and oppose their <HI>English</HI> Invadors, as this brief Relation will truly declare and manifest.</P>
<P>Thus force resisted force, the <HI>Saxons, Danes, English, Irish,</HI> and <HI>Flemmings,</HI> all severally, and sometimes joyned together, to conquer, and make prey and purchase of poor <HI>Wales,</HI> they all striving to have the Goods and Lands that be∣longed not to them; and the <HI>Welsh</HI> men (with
<PB N="31" REF="16"/>their best indeavours) justly and valiantly hold∣ing their own. They had kept their Country &amp; language 2700. years, and the Historians, Anti∣quaries, and Gentry of that Nation did record their Laws, Pedigrees, and Genealogies, with as much, or more, exact truth then many, or a∣ny other Nations. They had lived under their own Governours (from the time of <HI>Heli</HI> the High Priest of the Jews,) 1800 years before <HI>Cad∣wallador,</HI> who went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and died there; from which time the chief Rulers of <HI>Wales,</HI> were sometimes stiled Kings, sometimes Princes; these were many times under one King or Prince, of <HI>Northwales;</HI> sometimes they had three Princes or Kings, as <HI>North-Wales, South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Powis Land.</HI> These three Princes, although they had many and mighty Enemies, did often make Warre upon each other, spoiling, and harrasing their Countrey, to the advantage of their Ene∣mies and ruine of themselves. But to proceed to the History.</P>
<P>In the yeare 688. <HI>Ivor</HI> (a kinsman of <HI>Cadwala∣dor</HI>) was Prince some small time; and hee also went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and there ended his daies.</P>
<P>The Next <HI>Ivor, Roderick Molwinnoc,</HI> the second Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> rained 30 years; he was Grandchild to <HI>Cadwallador,</HI> a valiant man, he died <HI>Anno</HI> 755.</P>
<P>The third was <HI>Canon Tindaethwy,</HI> a gallant Prince, he Warr'd with good success, against
<PB N="32" REF="17"/><HI>Offa,</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> who would have invaded <HI>North Wales;</HI> but <HI>Canon</HI> did defend himselfe so stoutly, that <HI>Offa</HI> with much loss retired: the English at that time had not one foot of ground in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 800. <HI>Mervin</HI> was the fourth King of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> he married <HI>Esylht,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Ca∣non;</HI> in his time <HI>Egbert,</HI> King of the West <HI>Saxons,</HI> invaded and spoyled <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and <HI>Kenulph,</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> did much mischiefe in <HI>Powis Land,</HI> whereby <HI>Mervin</HI> being overpowred, was slaine, valiantly fighting against the King of <HI>Mercia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 843. <HI>Roderick</HI> the second (called the Great) was the 5. King of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> hee had much war with the English <HI>Mercians,</HI> with va∣rious success, but for the most part fortunate. In his Raigne, the <HI>Danes</HI> came and spoiled <HI>Angle∣sey,</HI> against whom Prince <HI>Roderick</HI> manfully fighting was unfortunately slaine. But some do write, that he did beat the <HI>Danes</HI> out of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and slain afterwards in a Battell against the En∣glishmen, <HI>Anno</HI> 876. when he had raigned with much love and honour 39 years.</P>
<P>The 6. King or Prince was <HI>Anarawd,</HI> the son of <HI>Roderick;</HI> and about that time of <HI>Anno</HI> 877. the <HI>Normans,</HI> with their Duke <HI>Rollo,</HI> invaded a great Province in <HI>France,</HI> which from the name of <HI>Normans,</HI> (or Northern men) is to this day called <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of grace 878. the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="17"/>men came with great powers against <HI>Wales,</HI> be∣tween whom and the <HI>Welsh</HI> was then a bloudy battell, near the water of <HI>Conwy,</HI> where the <HI>Welsh</HI> had a mighty Victory, which they called the Re∣venge for the death of <HI>Roderick.</HI> Prince <HI>Anarawd</HI> died, after much trouble, in <HI>Anno</HI> 913. having Rained 34. years.</P>
<P>Seventhly, or the 7. Prince was <HI>Edwal Voel,</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> spoyled <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> burnt and spoiled <HI>Brecknock. Athelstane</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> enforced the <HI>Welsh</HI> to pay him a yearly tribute of 20 pounds in Gold, 300 pounds in silver, and 200 Bieves, or Cattell. Afterwards <HI>Edwal Voel</HI> had raigned 25 years, he and his Brother <HI>Else</HI> were both slaine, fighting with the <HI>Danes, Anno</HI> 938.</P>
<P>The 8. Prince was <HI>Howell Dha,</HI> he was a kins∣man to <HI>Edwal Voel,</HI> he was a Prince of <HI>South-wales,</HI> but he afterwards had all <HI>Wales;</HI> the <HI>English</HI> vexed him often, and did much hurt; but still <HI>Howel</HI> galantly resisted them, and died much lamented, in the year of Christ 948.</P>
<P>The 9. were <HI>Jevas</HI> and <HI>Jago,</HI> or <HI>James,</HI> both Brethren, and sons to <HI>Edwal Voel.</HI> They had cru∣ell wars with <HI>Owen,</HI> and his Brethren, (the sons of <HI>Howel Dha</HI>) in which Bickerings <HI>Owen</HI> (with his Brothers) were slaine. About this time the <HI>Danes</HI> spoiled <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and burnt <HI>Holy-head.</HI> And also <HI>Wales</HI> was much troubled by <HI>Edgar</HI> King of <HI>England;</HI> but it was agreed at last, that the tri∣bute
<PB N="34" REF="18"/>of gold, &amp; silver, &amp; cattel, which was laid on the Welsh Nation in <HI>Edwal Voels</HI> time, after it had been paid near 13 years, should be remitted, and in lieu thereof, the Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> were in∣joyned to pay a certaine number of Woolves heads (for at that time four-leg'd Woolves did as much mischiefe amongst Beasts, Sheep, and Cattell, as two-leg'd Woolves have done in these latter times amongst men,) and by the means of the yearly payment of the aforesaid Woolves heads, there was not one of those ra∣venous beasts in three years payment to be found in all <HI>Wales,</HI> or the Marches of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Brethren the Princes fell our, (for Lord∣ship and Love can brook no Rivalls or fellow∣ship) <HI>James</HI> imprisoned <HI>Jevaf</HI> a long time, at which time, the <HI>Danes</HI> entred <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and did much spoile, <HI>Howell</HI> the son of <HI>Jevaf,</HI> made sharp war against his Unkle <HI>Jago,</HI> or <HI>James,</HI> and beat him, and releast his Father, after which he took his eldest Unkle <HI>Meric,</HI> and put his eyes out; but never restored his Father to his former e∣state, but kept the Principality to himselfe: This was about the yeare of our Lord 974.</P>
<P>The 10. King or Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> (or al∣most all <HI>Wales</HI>) was <HI>Howell ap Jevaf,</HI> or the son of <HI>Jevaf, Anno</HI> 975. there was great wars and much bloudshed betwixt <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North-Wales;</HI> but <HI>Howell</HI> took his Unkle <HI>James,</HI> which had impri∣soned his Father <HI>Jevaf,</HI> and then possest all <HI>Wales</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="18"/>in peace, for a short while, for the <HI>Danes</HI> brake in and spoiled many Towns and places in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and did much mischiefe to the Cathedrall of S. <HI>Davids.</HI> And in 982. a great Army from <HI>England,</HI> wasted and spoiled <HI>Brecknock,</HI> and a great part of <HI>South-Wales;</HI> but Prince <HI>Howell</HI> made war against them, slew many, and made the rest flee. The second yeare after <HI>Howell</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> with an Army, in which war he was slaine valiantly fighting, in the yeare 984. to whom succeeded his Brother.</P>
<P><HI>Cadwallon,</HI> the 11. Prince, he first warred a∣gainst <HI>Jonavall</HI> the son of <HI>Meric,</HI> whose eyes <HI>Ho∣well</HI> had caused to be put out, who by right was right Lord of all <HI>Wales:</HI> In the end <HI>Jonavall</HI> was slain by <HI>Cadwalhon,</HI> and the next year after <HI>Cad∣walhon</HI> himselfe was kill'd by <HI>Meredith,</HI> the son of <HI>Owen,</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales, Anno</HI> 985.</P>
<P>The 12. King or Prince was <HI>Meredith ap Owen,</HI> or the son of <HI>Owen,</HI> which <HI>Owen</HI> was son to <HI>Ho∣well Dha,</HI> before mentioned; he began in the yeare 986. and had a most troublesome Govern∣ment; for the <HI>Danes</HI> again wasted <HI>Anglesey.</HI> They took Prisoner <HI>Lhywach,</HI> Brother to Prince <HI>Me∣redith,</HI> and put his eyes out, and the <HI>Danes</HI> tooke 2000 Prisoners, and either carried them away, or put them to ransome, and in the yeare 98. the <HI>Danes</HI> came againe and spoyled St. <HI>Davids, Lhandydoch, Llanbadarne, Llanristed,</HI> and all Religious Places of Devotion that their hea∣thenish
<PB N="36" REF="19"/>power could master.</P>
<P>In these troubles Prince <HI>Meredith</HI> was forced to give those miscreant <HI>Danes,</HI> a peny a Head for every man that was then alive in all his Domi∣nions; which payment was called the Black Ar∣mies Tribute; about this time all <HI>South-Wales</HI> was over-ran by the <HI>English,</HI> and (to fill the measure of the Affliction in <HI>Wales</HI>) <HI>Meredith</HI> made mighty havock in <HI>Glamorgan-shire:</HI> So that there was not any place in <HI>Wales,</HI> free from the fury of fire and sword. But to make the measure of misery heap and run over, the <HI>Danes</HI> came once more and made a prey of the Isle of <HI>Anglesey;</HI> with which continuall troubles <HI>Me∣redith</HI> being overladen and wearied, resigned his Princely Authority to <HI>Edwal ap Meric ap Mere∣dith,</HI> or his own Grandchild: <HI>Meredith died</HI> 998.</P>
<P><HI>Edwal</HI> the 13. Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> was scarce warm in his seat, but <HI>Meredith</HI> sought and fought for re-possession, and after much bloudshed, lost his labour. Then the <HI>Danes</HI> came again and spoiled much in <HI>North-Wales;</HI> and the Prince valiantly fighting was slain, and the same <HI>Danes</HI> came again to S. <HI>Davids,</HI> ransack'd it, and spoi∣led all the Countrey.</P>
<P>The 14. King was <HI>Aedan ap Belgored,</HI> he fought for the Principality with <HI>Conan</HI> the son of <HI>Ho∣well,</HI> and slew him in the year 1003. About this time the <HI>Danes</HI> spoiled many places in <HI>West-Wales;</HI> and in this Princes Raigne all the <HI>Danes</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="19"/>were slaine in one night; and <HI>Anno</HI> 1015. Prince <HI>Aedon</HI> was slain by his successor.</P>
<P><HI>Lhewelyn ap Sitsylht,</HI> after he had kill'd <HI>Aedan,</HI> was the 15. Prince; he had a peacefull and plen∣tifull beginning, till a low born <HI>Scot,</HI> whose name was <HI>Runne,</HI> faigned himselfe to be the sonne of <HI>Meredith ap Owen</HI> before named: But <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> met him, and fought with him, and in the end made <HI>Runne</HI> run, till at last he killed him; And after that, this Prince was slaine by <HI>Howell</HI> and <HI>Meredith</HI> the sons of <HI>Edwal,</HI> 1026.</P>
<P>The 16. Prince was <HI>Jago</HI> (or <HI>James</HI>) the son of <HI>Edwal,</HI> he rained over <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Rytherch ap Jestin</HI> swayed in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> 1031. But by continuall contention betwixt the Grandchil∣dren of <HI>Howell Dha, Rytherch</HI> (Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI>) was slain by the <HI>English;</HI> and then arose new Wars in <HI>NorthWales,</HI> for <HI>Griffith ap Lbewelyn ap Sytylth</HI> war'd against <HI>Jago,</HI> slew him, and pos∣sest the Principality, <HI>Anno,</HI> 1037.</P>
<P><HI>Griffith ap Lhewelyn</HI> was the 17. Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> he overcame both the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Danes,</HI> when they would have invaded his Land, <HI>in Anno,</HI> 1038. He had much trouble with Prince <HI>Howell</HI> of <HI>South-Wales;</HI> but in the end he overcame him, and possest his Principallity; after this <HI>Griffith</HI> was treacherously taken, by <HI>Conan</HI> the Son of <HI>Jago,</HI> and as <HI>Conan</HI> was carrying him a∣way towards some <HI>Irish</HI> Ships, the Country a∣rose up speedily and happily, and (after a sharpe
<PB N="38" REF="20"/>fight) redeemed their Prince <HI>Griffith,</HI> and <HI>Conan</HI> was forced to flie for his life. After that the Prince had another great fight with <HI>Howell ap E∣dwin,</HI> which <HI>Howell</HI> was joyn'd with the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> and in a bloudy battle the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> were overthrown, that very few esca∣ped; <HI>Howell</HI> was slain &amp; Prince <HI>Griffith</HI> victorious; but peace lasted not three Months, but <HI>Ritherich</HI> and <HI>Rees,</HI> two of <HI>Jestins</HI> Sons, made War upon <HI>Griffith,</HI> and after a cruel fight all day, the darke night parted them, that both Armies returned with great losse to their homes.</P>
<P>About this time there raigned in <HI>Scotland</HI> a bloudy usurping Tyrant, named <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> hee caused a Lord, one <HI>Bancho,</HI> to bee murthered, whose Son, named <HI>Fleance,</HI> escaped and fled into <HI>Wales,</HI> and was courteously entertained, with love and welcome to Prince <HI>Griffith; Griffith</HI> had a bountifull Daughter, with whom <HI>Fleance</HI> grew to be so familiar, that he got her with child; for which the offended Prince caused the head of <HI>Fleance</HI> to be strooke off, and in rage cast off his Daughter, who was in short time delivered of a Male Child, named <HI>Walter:</HI> This <HI>Walter</HI> grew to be a tall goodly Gentleman to whom few or scarce one was comparable for strength, feature, valour, agillity and affability: And when one in derision called him Bastard he killed him, and fled into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the yeare 1052, and in the Raign of <HI>Robert Bruise</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> then with
<PB N="39" REF="20"/>which King, the said <HI>Walter</HI> won such favour, for some gallant services which he had done, that with love and honour, he was made Lord <HI>Stuart,</HI> or <HI>Steward,</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and receiver of the Kings whole Revenue; and from that Office did come the name of <HI>Steward,</HI> now called <HI>Stuart,</HI> of which Sirname many Kings, Princes, Lords, and Gen∣tlemen have been and are descended.</P>
<P><HI>Griffith ap Ritherch ap Jestin,</HI> made hot War a∣gainst <HI>Griffith ap Lhewelyn,</HI> but <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> overcame and slew him, 1054. then he made an inrode in∣to <HI>England,</HI> and with the ayd of <HI>Algar</HI> Earle of <HI>Chester,</HI> hee spoyled all <HI>Hereford shire,</HI> and burnt the City of <HI>Hereford</HI> to ashes, and returned with much spoyle.</P>
<P>But in the conclusion the <HI>Danes</HI> were ayded by <HI>Harrold</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> and assisted by some perfidious <HI>Welsh</HI> Lords, they entred <HI>Wales</HI> with great Forces, at which time this Noble Prince <HI>Griffith ap Lhewelyn,</HI> was treacherously murdered by his own men, and his head presented to <HI>Har∣rold</HI> King of <HI>England.</HI> Thus this gallant <HI>Griffith,</HI> liv'd beloved, and dy'd lamented, when hee had governed 34 years.</P>
<P><HI>Blethyn</HI> and <HI>Rywalhon,</HI> were the Sonnes of <HI>Conum,</HI> and Brothers by the Mothers side to <HI>Griffith ap Lhewelyn;</HI> in the Raign of these two, <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> Surnamed the Conquerour, came into <HI>En∣gland, Anno</HI> 1066. and in 1068. two Sons of <HI>Grif∣fith ap Lhewelyn,</HI> did raise War against <HI>Blethyn</HI> &amp;

<P>After much trouble, many cruel fights, with great slaughters of, and against <HI>Normans, English, Irish, Scots,</HI> and continuall War with <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and divers places more in <HI>Wales;</HI> this victorious Prince dyed, much beloved aud lamented for, when he had Nobly Ruled 50. years, <HI>Anno</HI> 1137.</P>
<P>The 21. King was <HI>Owen Gwynneth,</HI> who was Sou to the last Famous Prince <HI>Griffith,</HI> he began with Wars against <HI>South-Wales,</HI> where the <HI>En∣glish</HI> had taken possession, with <HI>Flemmings, Nor∣mans,</HI> and others; he chased them away, burnt and spoyled <HI>Caermarden,</HI> and returned victorious∣ly to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> 1142. in the year, 1143. seven great Lords, all of them of Princely blood and pedigree, were slain in <HI>Wales;</HI> Also at this time
<PB N="42" REF="22"/>the <HI>Irish</HI> did much spoyle, and in conelusion were spoyled by Prince <HI>Owen,</HI> and near this time, <HI>Howell</HI> and <HI>Conan, Owens</HI> Sons, gave the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> and <HI>Flemmings</HI> a bloudy discomfeture at <HI>Abertivye,</HI> and returned to their Father with spoyle and honour: Yet these Wars continued still, but the <HI>Flemmings</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> were beaten twice more at the Castles of <HI>Carmarden</HI> and <HI>Lhanstephan,</HI> from the yeare of Christ, 1138. to 1160 being 32. years, <HI>Wales</HI> had not so much as six Moneths peace and quietness.</P>
<P>And then, before one yeare was expired the Princes of <HI>South-Wales</HI> quarrelled with Prince <HI>Owen,</HI> and after some dangerous bickerings <HI>Owen</HI> had the Victory. <HI>In Anno,</HI> 1163. <HI>Henry</HI> the Se∣cond, King of <HI>England,</HI> made great preparations for War, hee entred <HI>South-Wales,</HI> as far as <HI>Breck∣nok,</HI> and returnd without any cause of triumph∣ing. And in the year, 1165. the said King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second came in Person again, having in his Army the stoutest of <HI>Englishmen, Normans, Gas∣coigners, Flemmings, Guiencys,</HI> and some fugitive <HI>Welch;</HI> but Prince <HI>Owen</HI> joyned with <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and others, after much fighting, and losse on both sides, King <HI>Henry</HI> returned without Con∣quest, and fewer men then he brought forth: Also the next year, 1167. the same King made a greater inrode into <HI>Wales,</HI> to as much purpose as he had, done twice before. Also, presently, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick of these troubles, another Army of
<PB N="43" REF="22"/><HI>Flemmings</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> came to <HI>West-Wales,</HI> did much harm, and in the end returned with much losse.</P>
<P>Then presently, to make the misery of <HI>Wales</HI> compleat, the <HI>Welsh</HI> Lords fell together by the ears one with another; and after a weary and troublesome Raign of 32. yeares, the magnani∣mous Prince <HI>Owen Guineth</HI> dyed, <HI>Anno,</HI> 1169.</P>
<P>His Son <HI>David</HI> succeeded the 22 Prince, who was fain to fight for it, and kill his Brother <HI>Ho∣well,</HI> before he could attain the Princedom. Then did <HI>Henry</HI> the 2. King of <HI>England</HI> enter <HI>South-Wales,</HI> took the Town of <HI>Caerleon</HI> from the Lo. <HI>Jorworth,</HI> and quite destroyed it: and in 1172. after a te∣dious molestation, Prince <HI>David ap Owen</HI> was ex∣pulst from his Rule: and,</P>
<P><HI>Lhewelyn ap Jorworth,</HI> being lawfull Prince, took the Government, 1194. <HI>Richard</HI> the first of that Name being then King of <HI>England.</HI> This Prince had a quiet beginning in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> but <HI>South-Wales</HI> was much vexed; for K. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with <HI>David ap Owen,</HI> before named, who was de∣posed or expulsed, came with an Army against Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> who fought and beat K. <HI>John,</HI> and took <HI>David</HI> prisoner, and kept him fast; and the same yeare there was another bloudy Battell fought, between the <HI>English</HI> and the Lords of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and many men slain by the treachery of some Welsh Lords, for private interests.</P>
<P>In 12 yeares Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> had not one
<PB N="44" REF="23"/>months quietness, yet he was still victorious.</P>
<P>1211. K. <HI>John</HI> came into <HI>Wales</HI> with a mighty Army, with a purpose to destroy all that had life; but he returned with great loss: and the next year he came again, when (by reason that the <HI>English</HI> King had many <HI>Welsh</HI> Lords to take his part) Prince <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jorworth</HI> came to an agreement with K. <HI>John,</HI> and gave him 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 40 Horses: But covenants not being kept by occasion of the harsh dealing of the English Nobles, and their Officers, made to the Prince to raise an Army, and take some Castles and Coun∣tries, for which K. <HI>John</HI> caused the Gentlemen (which he had for Pledges) to be all hang'd; and with another great Army he came into <HI>Wales</HI> a∣gain, to no purpose; for K. <HI>John</HI> had his hands and head full of troubles at home, with the Pope and the <HI>French,</HI> that he was forced to leave <HI>Wales,</HI> and return, to his great grief and loss.</P>
<P>In the yeare of Grace 1214. there was great wars between the Lords of <HI>South-Wales</HI> and <HI>Powis, Welsh</HI> against <HI>Welsh,</HI> and much mischiefe done on both sides: And <HI>Anno</HI> 1215. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> made an Inrode into <HI>England;</HI> then hee wonne <HI>Shrewshury,</HI> sack'd it, and returned into <HI>South-Wales,</HI> he took <HI>Caermarden</HI> from the <HI>English,</HI> raised the Castle, and took 12 Castles more, and returned home triumphant: shortly after he subdued all <HI>Powis Land</HI> to his obedience, and in <HI>Anno</HI> 1217. he brought all <HI>Wales</HI> to his subjection. He had
<PB N="45" REF="23"/>not a weekes rest from the yeare 1218. to 1221. but either <HI>Welsh, English, Flemmings,</HI> or other troubles kept him from idleness, and still it was his happiness to be Victor.</P>
<P>King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> being reconciled to the Pope, the French expulst from thence, and the Kingdome in quiet, the King (having little to do at home) would have the tother bout with <HI>Wales,</HI> which he attempted with much Charge, and bad success, and shortly after died; to whom his son <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. succeeded, who made a speedy expedition against <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and returned home with much detriment, &amp; peace was made for a smal time; for in <HI>Anno</HI> 1231. K. <HI>Henry</HI> made another great preparation against the Prince, to the effect aforesaid.</P>
<P>In 1232. <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> made an expedition into <HI>England,</HI> and returned with much Riches and Honour. In 1233. <HI>South-Wales</HI> raised new wars; but the Prince went in person and beat them in∣to some quietness, overthrew their Castles and strong holds, and returned renowned.</P>
<P>And the same yeare K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. came in∣to <HI>Wales,</HI> with a greater Army then ever, com∣pact of divers Nations, with an intent to destroy all he could, but was deceived in his purpose, and went home a loser: Then K. <HI>Henry</HI> sent the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with the Bishops of <HI>Rochester</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> to make a peace with <HI>Lhew∣elyn,</HI> but it could not be effected.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="24"/>
<P>Then this peerless Prince died, beloved, and lamented, and was buried at <HI>Conwy.</HI> He married <HI>Jone</HI> the daughter of K. <HI>John,</HI> by whom he had two sons <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Griffith;</HI> this <HI>David</HI> kept his brother <HI>Griffith</HI> in prison all his raigne. The Noble Prince <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jorworth,</HI> raigned 56 years.</P>
<P>To whom <HI>David ap Lhewelyn</HI> succeeded, being the 24. Prince, <HI>Anno</HI> 1240. This Prince was cursed by the Pope, and hated by the people for imprisoning his Brother <HI>Griffith;</HI> for which the K. of <HI>England</HI> came against him with an Army, but a peace was made, and <HI>Griffith</HI> not releas'd, who striving to break prison and escape, by tying of Lines and Sheets, with such other stuff which he had, and as he gat out of a high window, he putting all his weight to the Lines, they brake, and he being fat and heavy, fell with his head downwards, where he lay a most pittifull dead spectacle, for his head and neck were beaten for∣cibly into his body.</P>
<P>Then K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. (as his Predecessors had often done) strived to have <HI>Wales</HI> under his obe∣dience, to which purpose he in 1245. raised a mighty Army, and was more mightily met and foyled by Prince <HI>David;</HI> soone after <HI>David</HI> died, when he had Ruled 5 years, 1246.</P>
<P><HI>Lhewelyn ap Griffith,</HI> or the Son of <HI>Griffith</HI> that dyed with a fall, was the 25 Prince, for his Un∣kle, Prince <HI>David</HI> had no Issue, this man was va∣liant,
<PB N="47" REF="24"/>but unfortunate, for his two Brethren, <HI>O∣wen</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> made War upon him, but he vanquisht them, and was Master of all <HI>Wales:</HI> he strived much to shake off the yoke of <HI>England,</HI> and perforce hee chased all the <HI>English</HI> out of <HI>Wales,</HI> with great slaughter, 1256. King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, with two great Armies entred <HI>Wales</HI> in severall places, did much spoile, received much loss, and returned angry.</P>
<P>In 1258. <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley</HI> with <HI>Germane</HI> Horsemen, did much spoile, and killed many in <HI>Wales,</HI> but in the end, the Welshmen gave them such welcome, that few of the <HI>Germanes</HI> return'd. In these times in all places in <HI>VVales</HI> was conti∣nuall strife, spoile, and bloudshed; for <HI>the</HI> En∣glish <HI>would Have; and the</HI> Welsh <HI>would Hold:</HI> In 1267. <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> entred <HI>England,</HI> spoyled and de∣stroyed <HI>Chester,</HI> and much of that County; but after that, the Welsh had a great overthrow at a place called <HI>Clun,</HI> and in 1268. <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>England</HI> with an Army entred <HI>VVales</HI> again; but by the means of Cardinall <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tobonus</HI> (the Popes Legate) a Peace was made, and the Prince paid to the K. of <HI>England</HI> 30000 Marks. In <HI>Anno</HI> 1272. King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. died, and his son <HI>Edward</HI> the 1. went to <HI>Chester,</HI> from whence he sent a Summons to command Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> to come to him and doe homage: But the Prince refused, and would not come to the King.

<PB N="48" REF="25"/>at once; but (upon hard conditions) a Peace was concluded, which lasted not long; for <HI>Anno</HI> 1281. they fell to it cruelly again: The Prince said, that <HI>it was a bard thing to live in War alwayes; but it was harder to live in continuall slave∣ry:</HI> soon after, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was slaine, va∣liantly fighting, and all <HI>Wales</HI> fell to the Crowne of <HI>England,</HI> after it had continued from <HI>Brute</HI> and <HI>Camber</HI> 2418 years, to the year of <HI>Christ</HI> 1282.</P>
