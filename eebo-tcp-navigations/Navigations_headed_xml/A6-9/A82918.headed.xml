<HEAD>THE SPANISH FLEET OVER∣throwne in the Sea going to assist the Rebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ENuy is the badge of ensuing cruelty, malice is the Typicall <HI>Idaea</HI> of tyranie, for when as intestine malice becomes inveterate, no∣thing can satisfie it, but bloud, nothing can quench the aspiring flame of their ardent intentions, but the immolation of bloud, nothing lastly can stop the impetuous violence of the swift run∣ning torrent of their greedy minds, but humane flesh. O horred Tyrannie, Yea where Envy is entertayned in the habitacle of the mind, there men will not desist to plough over the Ocean, untill they come to the object of their resolutions, where like in a luxurious harvest they will glutt their hungry swordes in humane flesh, and make drunke their thirsty speares with mortall bloud, and cut downe the trunkes of living men, as the ravenous sithe devoures the trembling come. This malice I say, so tyrannicall, so bloudy, so nefari∣ous have beene lodged in the intestine breasts of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> a long time: who have alwaies in∣tended to depopulate, and subvert the Brittish
<PB REF="3"/>Nation to the utter demolition of Protestant Religion. But being oftentimes prevented in their designes, they have beene more vehement∣ly desirous to come to the object of their former intended conspiracies against the British Nation. VVherefore having some oppertunity in <HI>Ireland</HI> having there Rebells that would connive with them, and concurre in a bloudy Massacre they sent over before St. Patricke Devons with a num∣erous multitude of men to the number of above five thousand and more in Armes, Who went in a Navie into <HI>Ireland</HI> to the auxiliation of the Rebells. Where although at their first arrivall <HI>Turone</HI> and his confederates joyfully entertayned him with respective congratulation for his love: yet the Earle of <HI>Clanrickards</HI> afterwards saluted him with a valley of shot and slew most of his men that were under his command. Having such ill successe in their first Navie, they congrega∣ted another three times greater then the former, to the number of fiveteene thousand men tran∣sporting with them many Armes and military Ammunition to re-asist the Rebells. Thus be∣ing armed as well internally in their resolutions as enternally, they tooke Shipping, and with great alacrity <HI>Navem ascenderunt,</HI> they thus pro∣ceeded to <HI>Ireland</HI> very jocund; having sent a <HI>He∣rald</HI> of Armes before to the Rebells giving them notice of their comming; but at length as they were all tuned in their luxurious thoughts of
<PB REF="3"/>inhumane crueltie, a suddaine and violent Tem∣pest arose, which dissipated their ships, beate them vehemently upon a Rocke, and their Navie being impetuously disjected in pieces, they were drowned in the all-devouring Sea. Thus we may see the just Judgement of Almightie God, whose omnipotencie will not permit such ravenous Wolves to devoure his little Flocke. For although like the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> they did follow us, as they did the <HI>Israelites,</HI> yet like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and all his Hoste, they were overwhelmed in the Sea. But not to digresse from my intended Sub∣ject in a too errant deviation, I will recall my Pen to it's former discourse. The Rebels being frustra∣ted of their expectation in the Spanish Fleet, and perceiving they were all drowned in the Ocean, be∣gan to deplore and condole their inauspitious fate, greatly lamenting their disastrous fortune. But would to God, while they pampe forth gushing teares from their eyes, for the overthrow of the Spaniards, that it might swell to a Deluge, and like them, overwhelme themselves in the inunda∣tion of their own teares. But to omit the superflu∣ous description of their griefe, I will expresse the Letter which was sent from the Spanish Fleet by the Herald of Armes to the Lord <HI>Donmadoffe</HI> the Arch Rebell in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the Right Honourable, and thrice Noble the Lord Donmadoffe in Clogam in the County of Manahom, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE plausible commendation of your magnanimous courage in prosecution of the Protestant party being oftentimes annunci∣ated unto us, have at this time respectively in∣duced us to present an auxiliary Army unto your honours gracious acceptance: which is the height of our ambition to obtaine. We have maturely considered of the multiplicitie of the numerous confronts given you heretofore by the Protestants, and of the abusive insultations which they have usurped over you, and sometimes over our selves too: we therefore are resolved to vindicate both our owne cause, and yours: which apparently shall be demonstrated, and sufficiently declared to the Brittish Nation at our first arrivall. My Lord, if your Honour would vouchsafe to con∣curre with us in a conjunction of our Armies we doubt not but we shall subvert them at our first salutation, and become so victorious, that we may returne with an Olive branch in our hands. In the meane time what we most implore in our ardent desires is your acceptance of our service: which if you grant, shall be a perfect Type of our ob∣sequious opitulation and a sufficient Caractar of our ensuing victory.</P>

<HEAD>An Order from the <HI>Committee</HI> that <HI>11300</HI> Horse should be conducted by Sir <HI>Simon Harecolt.</HI> into IRELAND. As also, <HI>A Letter read in the Parliament, sent from the Mayer of Doublin and other Justices of the Peace, how</HI> Tredagh <HI>is besieged, and</HI> Doublin <HI>in great feare of the Enemy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Committee having maturely and judi∣ciously considered of the extreame calami∣ty, and great misery which the Prote∣stants in <HI>Ireland</HI> dayly undergoe, by those bloudy and inhumane Tyrants, the Rebels: who have nei∣ther mercy nor partiality in them: did forthwith Order, that present and auxiliary ayd should be immediately provided for the assistance of the Protestant party; and they appointed more-over, That Sir <HI>Simon Harecolt</HI> should conduct eleven thousand and three hundred Horse for the same purpose. For they had diverse Letters directed unto them from the Mayre of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and other Justices of Peace, intimating, That <HI>Tredagh</HI> was besieged by the Rebels, and <HI>Dublin</HI> likewise in great danger of their tyrannicall inhumanity. Their proceedings are so nefariously abominable, that they seeme not onely to be detestable in the
<PB REF="5"/>sight of God, but also odious in the eares of Men. And whosoever truely perpends the Afflictions of the Brittish Nation, and what calamity they are involved, cannot but eliciate teares from his heart, were it of a meere Adamantine Composition. Their inhumanity is not terminated in the limi∣tation of humane lenity, but has beene so merci∣lesse, that the Parliament have respectively beene indued to send them an expedient and necessary auxiliation.</P>
