<HEAD>Of the reasons moving this people to transplant themselves and Families to those remote parts.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe great <HI>Jehova's</HI> working word effecting wondrously,</L>
<L>This earths vast globe, those parts unknown, to civill people by,</L>
<L>Columbus or <HI>Alkmerricus</HI> by providence direction,</L>
<L>Found out this Western world with store of mettels cleer extraction.</L>
<L>The Spanish project working well, tooke sudden such impression</L>
<L>In minds of many <HI>Europe</HI> held, who fell to like progression.</L>
<L>It's strange to see the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleete so many should provoke,</L>
<L>In <HI>English</HI> searching for like prize, they are vanisht into smoake.</L>
<L>Yet these undaunted hearts stir'd up a Colony to plant,</L>
<L>Hight Nova Anglia, for which they gain'd a patten grant.</L>
<L>Now all ancient seild and read in lands new population,</L>
<L>No parallell like this (I deeme) you'l finde in any Nation.</L>
<L>These people now begin with care to vese and plot, each man</L>
<L>That heares of this new Colony, with diligence doth scan.</L>
<L>Such motives as he hath in Eye, one he desires land,</L>
<L>Quoth he I see here landed men in reputation stand.</L>
<L>Hundreds and thousands I have not to purchase, but I will</L>
<L>Through seas much wood-land to atchieve, and medow ground my fill.</L>
<L>Ʋp starts another from a sad and serious contemplation,</L>
<L>How he a Gentleman might be, good man is his vexation.</L>
<L>House implements being turn'd to coyne, his cloath of fashion new,</L>
<L>To ship he hyes, much welcome Sir, for none his person knew.</L>
<L>New rais'd from sleepe, another cries, my earnings are but small,</L>
<L>I'le venter to this new-found world, and make amends for all.</L>
<L>In hast halfe breathlesse running, comes a man with longing sore</L>
<L>For novelties of new-found lands, the Seas he would leap o're.</L>
<L>His kindreds letters looking in, ha ha here's newes indeed,</L>
<L>From Brothers, Sisters, Ʋncles, Aunts, I'le ship my selfe with speed.</L>
<L>These but the straglers now remaines the chiefest troopes to eye,</L>
<L>Truth 'tis, their standard of resort was Christianity.</L>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<L>Couragious Captaines leading on, their coynes and lands 'way throwing,</L>
<L>Made many Souldiers follow fast, their bands in number growing.</L>
<L>When <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> began a Reformation,</L>
<L>It was a joyfull day to all, the godly of that Nation.</L>
<L><HI>Proh Dolor,</HI> it did not goe on, with joyfull acclamation.</L>
<L>But hirarchy and lordly throne of Prelacy invading,</L>
<L>The government of Christs deare flocke, then godlinesse was fading,</L>
<L>Some men impute it to the pride of Bishops, others say,</L>
<L>The loosenesse of the Laity did carry most away.</L>
<L>But sure it is that godlinesse, and purities deriding,</L>
<L>Mov'd many godly ones to seek, a place of new abiding.</L>
<L>Proud Bishops skil'd in policie of machivilian learning,</L>
<L>Fore-saw their pomp would fall to ground by Scripture cleer discerning,</L>
<L>New fangled fetches were devis'd for soone intrapping those</L>
<L>Who to the people faithfully truth wholly did disclose.</L>
<L>While things thus craftly were contriv'd, Preachers to prisons packe,</L>
<L>The Bishops Courts were fill'd with worke, and consciences on racke.</L>
<L>Come sirrah quoth the Commissary, you will no Surplice weare,</L>
<L>Nor yet proclaime our Sunday sports, a Puritan I feare</L>
<L>You are, and shall no more preach forth to people stir to reare</L>
<L>Against my Lords grace, I know well, your preaching doth him scare.</L>
<L>And to another: as for you, your faction is so much,</L>
<L>Whole townes run from their Parish Church to heare your word, are such.</L>
<L>As for to overthrow my Lord, and his commanding power,</L>
<L>If I live in this Diocesse, you shall not stand one houre.</L>
<L>In midst of all these wofull stirs grave godly men sit musing,</L>
<L>How they their talents might improve, to honour God in using.</L>
<L>Nine hundred leagues of roaring seas dishearten feeble parts,</L>
<L>Till cruell handling hasten on, and God doth strengthen hearts.</L>
<L>Come quoth the husband, my deare wife, canst thou the seas endure,</L>
<L>With all our young and tender babes, let's put our faith in ure.</L>
<L>With watry eyes the wife replies, what remedie remaines,</L>
<L>Forsaking all for Christ his sake, will prove the greatest gaines.</L>
<L>From in-land parts poore Christians packe to Sea-ports ships to enter,</L>
<L>A wonderment, in streets they passe, dividing their strange venter.</L>
<L>What meane these mad men soone sayes one, witlesse to run away,</L>
<L>From <HI>English</HI> beere, to water, where, no hoone companions stay,</L>
<L>But its the Surplice scares them hence, the Tippet and the Crosse,</L>
<L>Nay more they feare, my Lords grace here, will bring againe the masse.</L>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<L>Yea further I have heard of late our Puritans much wonder,</L>
<L>Because our Metropolitan intends to bring them under:</L>
<L>Thus passe the people to their ships, some grieve they should goe free,</L>
<L>But make them sweare, and search them bare, taking what coyne they see.</L>
<L>Now Satan seeing God had crost, his minde in making way,</L>
<L>For's people and his Pastors too, in wildernesse to stay.</L>
<L>Fearing Christs Kingdom would encrease, and his to ground be falling,</L>
<L>Stirs up fresh instruments like sheepe that wolfishly were haling.</L>
<L>Proud errour brochers, these croud in for liberty pretending,</L>
<L>The overthrow of <HI>Romish</HI> trash, their words against it bending.</L>
<L>Quoth one here none but Scholler may in pulpit be a Preacher,</L>
<L>Pleship my selfe, for sure I am, full gifted for a Teacher.</L>
<L>Ʋp starts another from a crowd, of women, her admiring,</L>
<L>An able tongue in Scripture learn'd, to preach forsooth desiring.</L>
<L>With revelations strange, yet true, as Scripture them accounting,</L>
<L>Another comes to ship himselfe, in knowledge all surmounting.</L>
<L>'Gainst Magistrates another cries, none such on earth should stand,</L>
<L>I'le venture o're the broadest Seas for freedome from their hand.</L>
<L>Thus diver sly dispos'd doe people pack up away,</L>
<L>To populate new Collonies, where none but Heathen stay.</L>

<L>Ship-owners seeing like it was their gain might holpen bee</L>
<L>And Ʋndertakers with like hope, to hire ships were free.</L>
<L>Close Cabbins being now prepar'd with bread, biefe, beere and fish,</L>
<L>The passengers prepare themselves that they may have their wish.</L>
<L>With little goods, but many words, aboord comes one, and sayes,</L>
<L>I long to set my feet on shore, where cloudy pillar stayes,</L>
<L>As high as clouds he darts his words, but it is earth he wants:</L>
<L>For having past the fishing banks, soon smels the gay ground plants,</L>
<L>In long boat with a scouring pace comes gentle-like attended,</L>
<L>New fashion'd by the Taylors hand, one for his parts commended.</L>
<L>Master at last quoth he, I'm not with labour much inured,</L>

<L>Hee's loath to say, that men of parts to govern towns are wanting,</L>
<L>And therefore he will through the seas, 'mongst others to be planting.</L>
<L>His Cabin is too strait, his fare too mean for his degree,</L>
<L>Now good Sir be content a while, on shore youl' he more free.</L>
<L>Eftsoones comes clambring up the ropes one in his mind revived,</L>
<L>That hee's no servant, quoth he, this was very well contrived,</L>
<L>Now I may goe where I can close with people and with Preacher,</L>
<L>But its great wages makes him close, for there he needs no teacher.</L>
<L>Brief dancing on the decks doth walk another boasting sore</L>
<L>Of godly kindred, and he longs to be with them on shore,</L>
<L>These and the like may England spare, but oh it's sad to say,</L>
<L>That privatly for publick work thy Worthies went away.</L>
<L>Sage, sober, grave and godly men, together counsell seeking</L>
<L>At th'hand of God, they fast and pray for their approved liking:</L>
<L>And will not stirre one foot, but by his word and will directing,</L>
<L>So on the seas most happily they found his hand directing.</L>
<L>Now large Revennewes hinder not, hoopt up in hogsheads they</L>
<L>Transport both lands and houses too, nine hundred leagues away.</L>
<L>Oh we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l away, now say the poore, our Benefactors going,</L>

<L>With trickling tears, scarce uttering speech, another sobbing sayes,</L>
<L>If our poore preacher shipped be, hee'l nere live halfe the way,</L>
<L>But one poore friend, another cries, my secret heart to plain,</L>
<L>And he and his are shipped, now I'le after him amain.</L>
<L>'Mongst these doth Satan get a fraught, Angels of light they seeming,</L>
<L>Were entertain'd among the rest, as holy Saints them deeming.</L>
<L>Hardly beset on every side, Gods people thus attended,</L>

<L>In straits to get their goods aboord, their wives and obildren small,</L>

<L>But God and godly friends, whom they find in their hard-ships free,</L>
<L>To send and lend them help in all, their great calamity.</L>
<L>The boysterous waves begin to hoyse their brittle barques on hye,</L>
<L>When suddenly the billowes breake, and dash their ships awry.</L>
<L>Ʋnwonted to such wondrous workes the little babes complaine</L>
<L>For harbour in their Mothers armes, whom sicknesse doth constraine</L>
<L>To sit as helplesse, yea, for help of others they doe cry,</L>

<L>In unknown depths, and pathlesse Seas, there nights and days they spend,</L>

<L>For all their height they fall downe flat, obey they must his will.</L>
<L>And now the Seas like medowes greene, whose ground and grasse even are,</L>

<L>Who would not wait on such a God, that heaven, earth, seas commands,</L>

<HEAD>Of their Civill Government</HEAD>
<P>THe Transplantation of this people and patten inrevaded, (though rare yet) honest advice in law was had by wise, so∣ber, and godly Gentlemens, fore-seeing the daily adding stones to such a work, would be more envyed then the Golden fleece of <HI>Cal∣chos.</HI> God giving favour, they attain'd a large patten under the bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Seale of <HI>England,</HI> to set up government, not only for the or∣derly
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>execution of judgment and justice among themselves, but for the suppressing of all malignant adversaries to the kingdome of Christ, that at any time should invade or disturb this government: for proofe ask their adversaries, who though <HI>Doeg</HI> like will tel you both Magistrates and Ministers joyne heart and hand herein, yet the latter meddle not with Civill Justice, as some would beare men in hand: But lets on, this patten hath proved corrasive to some, es∣pecially in not admitting appeales: Some seeking to have it reca'd; others crying out it's forfeit, yet hitherto held, and meet men year∣ly chose for Governour, Deputy, and Assistants, (whose acts of justice have passed sundry censures) as also from each Towne two Deputies are sent in the name of the Free-men, who joyning toge∣ther in one body or generall Court, have according to their patten made many Causes agreeable to the word of God, and their wil∣dernesse condition both for English and Indian to follow. Quarter Session, or Goale-delivery are kept by seven Magistrates, the Go∣vernour or Deputy being one: as also in the severall Shires for try∣als between man and man, are constant Courts kept, and in every Town certain persons are yearly chosen to end causes of lesser ver∣tue, with free accesse for any persons that finde themselves grieved, to appeal from one Court to another, even to the highest, which is the generall Court. Their laws are of three sorts; 1. The lawes of <HI>England,</HI> so far as the people and place can be capable. 2. Lawes wholly of their own. 3. When cases fall out, that neither of these will reach, they are to follow such rules as are cleerly drawn from the word of God: and because many men take upon them to in∣terpret the Scriptures now adays: so that instead of one of a thou∣sand, there appears a thousand to one, which makes them endea∣vour (with the ablest gifted men God hath given them) to obtaine positive lawes: for all matters may come in judgment, that Arbitra∣rinesse may be avoided. And now because the courage, dexterity, and skill of Commanders appeareth most when they meete with their enemie: know foure sorts of persons have battered this go∣vernment not only with their greater Artillery, at 900. leagues di∣stance, but with continuall small shot at 10. or 12. and sometimes at pistoll-shot, raising over-topping batteries, brest-works, &amp; out∣facing Galleries, delving deepe to undermine the foundation (though built on the surest rocke) casting forth fierce fireing gra∣nadoes, using all the stratagems such cunning Engineers could pos∣sibly
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>invent. The first onset was given by <HI>Bonasosias</HI> under the con∣duct of their host of Merri-mount, who having some tryals in the Courts of Justice, assaid to mend his bad cause with bribes: but finding repulse in both, began to make use of an Engine for battery called <HI>Pontifieatus</HI> (consulting with such as were best skil'd herein) to beate downe this new erected government, yet did little dam∣mage it, being of small force in these <HI>American</HI> parts: at length was intreated to depart, which he refusing, was shipt with a takele for the fertile Isle of great Brittain, which those Gentlemen now ru∣ling this Collony so lostly left, where he arriving, made his com∣plaint to those, whose lordly injunctions enforced the greater part of this people to make choise of a banished condition for them and theirs, enduring rather the wants of a wilderdesse, than a Prelats prison his (complaint being heard) appeales to <HI>England,</HI> being of purpose left out in the Mattachusets Patten, no Somner nor Purse∣vant was found to venter so far: yet the Host to make a merriment of the departure of so many reverend, learned, godly and judicious men (a sad Omen of some following tragedy) set forth a Pam∣phlet in print, full fraught with loud lies to make his <HI>Bonasosia's</HI> laugh. But prevailing little, ventured another voyage in these parts to find a new place for storming this government afresh, tracing the Countrey to and fro, was apprehended of Indian ammunition, ar∣row heads of a more mortal nature than any yet used among them. The second onset was given by greater troops of Sexs, not mar∣shal'd under the command of any one in chief: but those that could best use their battering Engine, were leaders of the rest: and verily they handled the matter so, that they came to handy gripes undis∣covered: their new Engine was called <HI>Populatri aure Captator,</HI> some∣what like the Trojan horse for rarity, it was covered with womens aprons, and bolstered out with the judgement and deep discerning of the godly and reverent: but to say truth, they fouly belied him; These Sectaries having made a breach in most Townes in the coun∣trey, publishing as through a trunk the great tyranny of those that rule over their own species, perswading Authority is so farre from maintaining liberty, that they cannot stand together: insomuch that Governours and governed began to wonder at the sudden al∣teration in Courts and countrey: so that it would have put an a∣ble Politick to a non-plus. But the Lord graciously assisting, they couragiously goe on, first unarming all suspected persons: and then
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>to prevent the spreading of this gangrin, they endeavour the dis∣persing of this red Regiment. Some at losse of esteeme voluntarily depart, others were banished, and others with-drawing submitted againe to the godly government of this Common wealth.</P>
<P>The third storm this government felt was from the scum of the former under the command of <HI>Samuel Gorton,</HI> who knowing some of his Sectaries were closely lurking behind in this government; sent forth his blasphemies to thunder downe all government as diabolicall, raging and railing against Magistrates and generall Courts, as murtherers, absolving from their obedience all such as would follow their opinion; had not the conceitednesse of their own elegancy hindered, they might have done much hurt, their leader being a very dangerous, bold-spoken fellow, and full of sawning; with which, having gained some 12. or 13. families to cide with him, inforcing land from the poore <HI>Indians</HI> by meanes of the most potent Sachim of those parts, under whose friendship they bare themselves bold against the united Colonies, building on the Indians land, having outed themselves from all governe∣ment, would not submit to any law or common reason, desperate∣ly going on, threatning bloud and death to any should come to ap∣prehend them; Yet at length were handsomely apprehended with∣out one drop of bloud spilt, for all their great boaster, brought to a generall Court, and there proceeded against: yet so slenderly (their offence being very destructive to all government: And of such an high nature) that their malice encreasing, their Censure did but exasperate, and not at all disinabled them to prosecute as formerly the great disturbance, if not overthrow of this little com∣mon-wealth; these persons yet remain, battering the united Colo∣nies with all the force they are able to make: and as they deny go∣vernment among Christians, so they endeavour to overthrow one government with another.</P>
<P>The 4<SUP>th</SUP> onset was made by a Doctor of physick, as Commander in chiefe, with sixe other inferiour Officers, who pretended they had thousands on their side: &amp; therefore to muster up al the force they could, proclaim (at a generall Court) themselves to be leaders to all discontented persons, who disliked any thing this govern∣ment had done (plausable to all the stragling <HI>Bonasosia</HI>'s and Prela∣ticall faction, that had hid themselves in holes since the former bickering) and furnishing them with fresh weapons, teaching them
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>to dissemble, as if siding with <HI>Englands</HI> government, promising to themselves the procurement of all the old Ceremonies and odds Holidayes. Next this blacke Regiment, appeared a red Regiment of fiery contentious persons, who for want of their wils against their adversaries in law, make many sad complaints; and now are perswaded, could they but cast down this government, they should have such laws, Lawyers, and Magistrates, that the case would goe alway on their side, whether Plaintiffe or defendant. In order fol∣lowed a white Regiment, consisting of sundry Sectaries, in hope of attaining liberty, or rather liscentiousnesse; were this government but once supprest to bring up the reare: under an Ensigne part, ar∣gent part, or colour, lappeared two sorts of people: the one dee∣ming it a way for encreale of trade, not only to blind-fold Justice, but stay her sword from falling on the heads of such as could cover their crime with pretence of conscience: The other possest with strong conceits, that if this government were not cast down, they should never come to govern. Thus furnished, they made strong opposition, some of them boasting what a day they should get: but their great numbers failing them, and in stead of thousands, there appeared not thirty: and further being apprehended in midst of their project, were imprisoned, and fined forther folly: yet but little in respect of their offence. Only thus much some have learned, to shew so much clemency to their adversaries, that it proves cru∣elty to their friends. What faithfulnesse, courage and justice in all these passages have been shewed by those in authority, cannot be waned by the reproachfull words, and piercing lookes of pale∣fac'd envy. And now my friend <HI>John,</HI> when thou hearest any up∣braiding, deriding, condemning, and exclaiming against this go∣vernment of this little Common-wealth, for my sake examine them before thou believe them, and you shall find them to have fled from one of these Regiments, or at least a wel-willer of theirs that could have wisht them the day: And now to end this slender touch of their Civill government, eye this following meeter.</P>

<HEAD>Of the planting of the Gospel of our Lord Christ in the Mattachusets, and other adjacent COLLONIES.</HEAD>
<P>WHen these persecuted servants of Christ Jesus first set foot on these American shores, having their tongues untied from the Prelates Injunctions, they preach with all diligence to their Auditors, doubling their hours to regain their lost time, being throughly warm'd with the manifestation of the love of their Lord Christ, in bearing them in his arms through the boystrous waves, a depthless Ocean; these exil'd Mi∣nisters of Christ soon began to gather into Churches, as meete stones were offered; and now you shall see how they hasted after fat Benefi∣tes, every one endeavouring to associate themselves with plain honest-hearted Christians rich in grace, the Lord assisting: with full purpose of heart to cleave unto the Lord Christ, and submit to his kingdome according to the rule of his word made known unto them: and also to exhort one another while it is called to day, (and this is the substance of that Church-covenant that so many are greived at;) this they doe with solemne and serious seeking of the Lord by prayer &amp; fasting. And now I beseech you all that rightly love the Lord Christ, forbeare taking up any prejudice against this poor people from the report of o∣thers. Could your eyes and eares see &amp; heare their comely order, and with what spirituall expressions the Lord assists his servants in the Mi∣nistry, it would assuredly (God helping) cause your bowels to yern to∣ward them &amp; the Churches to which they doe belong: many of whom hereafter are expressed by name, together with their annuall mainte∣nance so neere, as for the present I could gather.

In admit∣ting persons to the sacramentall union, they endeavour to see the manifestation of Gods grace wrought upon their souls, expressed by their godly lives and conversations, either by continued obser∣vance, or honest testimony, they are admitted by the Elders, with consent of the people; and all excommunications are by the same authority of the Elders, and consent of the people, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ administred to the terror of scandalous professors. As for prayer, singing of Psalmes, and the word prea∣ched, all are partakers of: and all children and servants in pub∣lick catechised, and verely the thirsting desires they have that all may come to the truth, even as it is in Jesus, appeares by the af∣fable and courteous carriage of all that preach the word, being instant in season and out of season, &amp;c. who are reputed both learned and judicious, and by Gods blessing on their labours, have gained many a soule to Christ. The people of these Colonies are generally labor ous after knowledge in religion, to which end they have societies, or neighbourly invitatations each of other, for edification; in which the industrious paines and care of their minister to propagate the truth, appeares, praying and opening the Scriptures thus privatly, besides all their publick administra∣tions. This truth may serve to shew the savourinesse of this salt: And now to take away the wonder how these ministers and peo∣ple should come by so many back friends, walking in mea∣sure so inoffensively, you shall understand, holinesse, righte∣ousnesse, humility, and learning in some called of Christ to be a∣ble ministers of his word and doctrine; divers, who love the pre∣heminence of both sexes, having taken a trick to preach to ad∣vance themselves, began to inveigh against learning, Scholars, and Colledges, and in mean time stretching out what themselves had, till they rent into non-sense, and verily these soon grew to a round company praising one anothers parts when others would not; and to cause others to admire them, they question the anci∣ent truths taught by their ministers, and that before the whole congregation, and tell you the meaning of the originall Text. These were abler to discerne (as they apprehend) than their El∣ders, who were fit for the Sacrament, delighting to shew their skill that way. Again, all know nothing is more opposite than damnable errors and saving truth. Now the unanimous agree∣ment

<PB N="20" REF="13"/>of their teaching Elders in the truth, hath caused those who are contrary minded, to misreport their words and actions, cun∣ningly casting false glosses on their doctrines, slighting all those godly Christians who agree in the fame truths, as weak punies, taking up all they have on trust. Further, take notice that our <HI>English</HI> nation having been accustomed after 16 yeares of age, to receive the Sacrament: now some here in these Colonies being upon good ground denied, with bitter speeches, and taunting lan∣guage, upbraid both magistrates, ministers and people, powring out their complaints into their bosoms who are their good frends in <HI>England,</HI> telling they are abridged of the liberties of <HI>English</HI> sub∣jects, &amp;c. Lastly, certain persons more affecting trade than truth, prove discontented with such as are against the sufferi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g grosse errors. These are the rubs have been cast in the way to hinder the through reformation; yet now, though with great difficulty, nearer accomplished than ever, if luke-warm liberty hinder not the good work of our God. And as for these instruments whom the Lord hath made use of, you marre the work, if you attribute ought unto them, and it will be very distastfull to their Christian appetites; yet I will shew their prosecuting the work in the fol∣lowing meeter.</P>

<P>These people, though much weakned in their estates, for the space of ten yeares, yet have erected Schooles in divers Townes, and also a Colledge in the Town of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> called <HI>Harves</HI> Colledge: The President being an able Proficient in the Tongues, very studious to promote learning, witnesse the young Audients both here and gone for <HI>England,</HI> hopefull instruments in the hands of the Lord for future times: the President is Mr. <HI>Dunster.</HI></P>

<L>Yet unto God this people feeling sayes,</L>
<L>Not unto us, but to thy name be praise.</L>
<L>Now must I mind what hindrances remain</L>
<L>To blast the fruit of all these Worthies pain.</L>
<L>Some would none should endevour unity,</L>
<L>Tyrants (say they) do hinder liberty:</L>
<L>Why truth's but one, and Christ will make you free,</L>
<L>Come to the Word, let that your touch-stome bee.</L>
<L>Some feare Presbytery hath too great power,</L>
<L>If you are Christs, then all they have is yours.</L>
<L>Some odd ones say they <HI>Independents</HI> are,</L>
<L>Therefore in others counsel they'l noe share</L>
<L>But now Ile end, and tell you friend, what will</L>
<L>Perswade their way do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>old with still.</L>
<L>Strong Arguments doe papers fill each way</L>

<L>Ʋnto experience let thy judgement bow,</L>
<L>Let actions speake, and not mens words to you.</L>
<L>For little time, some subtile Foxes will</L>
<L>Bridle their nature, and yet Foxes still.</L>
<L>Lord Bishops did some errors fend from sheep,</L>
<L>So beasts of prey others from preying keep.</L>
<L>Some new raisd errors Bishops power deny</L>
<L>To side with truth, and yet their error eye.</L>
<L>Neare twenty yeares these Churches you may trace</L>
<L>In godly steps, no false way they'l embrace.</L>
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
<L>Look in this glasse that thus is slubberd or'e,</L>
<L>And you may see foure things uneyd before.</L>
<L>No Prelate no King: that's not so, for see</L>
<L>Here Churches power and command agree,</L>
<L>Of civill power to which these Churches yeeld</L>
<L>Humble obedience, as their duty held.</L>
<L>Next note, some say, Opinions none must touch,</L>
<L>For feare they wrong the consciences of such,</L>
<L>With word of truth, God helping true endeavours,</L>
<L>Christs Pastor here error and conscience severs.</L>
<L>Third, Law and Gospel at such oddes have set,</L>
<L>That Rule of walking from it none may get.</L>
<L>But here experience from Gods word is found,</L>
<L>Gods folk with's word walk wary, looking round.</L>
<L>Last, humane learning is no mean, some say;</L>
<L>Blost by the Lord, to find his word and way,</L>
<L>But as a meanes this people found it have,</L>
<L>Yet trust not means, its onely God must save.</L>
<L>But England now to thee Il'e means commend,</L>
<L>Make use of these before their life they end.</L>
</LG>
<P>The grave, godly, and judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> is laid in earth Mr. <HI>Philips,</HI> Mr. <HI>Huet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harver,</HI> and some others of like esteem yet remaining in the united Colonies, of name and note: Onely my friend <HI>John,</HI> see here a short observation taken from the whole for thy own use.</P>
<LG>
<L>Church-covenant Band brought in with liberty,</L>
<L>But causeth men to walk licentiously.</L>
<L>Some buy the truth: for conscience liberty,</L>
<L>Error's brought in to blind men damningly.</L>
</LG>
<P>And now before I end, let me tell thee who are like to reap be∣nefite by transporting themselves to those Colonies: First, Mer∣chants who are skild in commerce with forraigne nations, lying near the Indies, and well stored with ship provision cheaper than <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Sea-men are well imploid, if skild in Navigation, shipping increasing every day, and would be farre more, had they Masters to manage the work.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>
<P>Thirdly, Has band-men are like to benefit themselves much all sorts of cattell increasing exceedingly, and tillage prospering, that thousands of Acres are broken up yearly.</P>
<P>Fourthly, all manuall occupations are falling into their ranks and places daily, (onely Printers of Cards, and Dice-makers, I could wish to forbeare,) very few but have increased in the riches of this life; and further how now men of estates may im∣prove what they have to their great advantage. And this I dare assure that one hundred pounds will doe that which five hundred could not doe at first planting of this little Common-wealth, which was the reason so many sunk in their estates; but now they see it too late, and some will not wait the Lords leasure for re∣pairing, but forsake their station, with others have gained much, and carry it to other places to shew, and so lose it again. But my <HI>Iohn,</HI> be thou more stable.</P>
<P>Last, let all those who desire to have themselves discovered to themselves, resort to this place; where, if they seek not them∣selves they may finde themselves, if not already lost in selfe-con∣ceitednesse of some strong opinion, for which if they desire to be admired, let them leave this long voyage, and keep at home.</P>
