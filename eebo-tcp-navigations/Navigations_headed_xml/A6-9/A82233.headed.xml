<HEAD>THE DECLARATION OF THE SEA COMMANDERS and Marriners in the Royall Navie and Fleet, now with his Hignesse Prince <HI>Charles</HI> now riding on the <HI>Downes.</HI> (<HI>August</HI> 2.)</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Ur late experience of the wofull effects of War, raiseth in us many most sad considerations, and feares of the un∣happie continuance thereof, in this our deare Mother Kingdom; unto the prevention of whose Calamities, wee are assured that God, and Nature, by all Obligations humane, and divine, most strictly bind us; In discharge therefore of this our duty unto God, and our Country, we doe in the presence of God publish un∣to the world, that we have already used, and shall forever hereafter use, the utmost of our endeavours, for the hap∣pie settlement, and quiet of this distracted and bleeding Kingdome: In evidence whereof, we have heretofore humbly petitioned both Houses of Parliament, for a
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>speedie Personall Treaty, betwixt his Majestie, and the two Houses, (being the only, and so often by them selves acknowledged expedient, to establish a safe, and well grounded peace) yet have been answered with such me∣ditated protractions and delayes, as gave us just cause to iudge, that all our Endeavours in this kind, would prove fruitlesse, and that the over-ruling partie in both (Houses never meant any such thing: So that throughly observing all our pious endeavours, (with those of others unto this purpose) herein frustrate, we could not bethink our selves of a more speedie and effectuall course, to arrive at that blessed, and by us most desired end; [the peace and prosperity of our Country] then by the rendition of our selves &amp; our returning unto our due Loyalty &amp; Obedience, unto his sacred Maiesty, our dear Soveraign; (from whom we cannot without much sorrow but acknowledge; that the subtile malice, &amp; many hypocritical pretentions, of his Maiesties most confirmed adversaries did to long alien us.) And in Order unto that to restore unto his Maiestie, as his most undoubted right) such Vessells of his Maie∣sties Navie Royall, as were in our power, together with what Ships of defence we had of our own, being by this course hopefull to render his Maiestie, (now suffering un∣der unparalel'd Oppressions) and his affaires more consi∣derable, unto such as opposed him, and hereby the better to dispose such, unto more visible tearmes of Accommo∣dation; that his Majestie might be restored unto his un∣questionable rights, and royall Prerogatives.</P>
<P>And this; we professe (before God) unto the whole world, that we could not but know and acknowleghe our
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>bounden duty, without a fearefull incurring within our own Consciences, the secret sentence of damnation; ha∣ving by our Oaths, and so many sacred Obligations, sol∣lemnly sworn and protested, the preservation of Religi∣on established by Law, his Majesties honour, person, and dignity, and the Liberty of the Subject. All which wee are accordingly resolved, God assisting, unto our utmost endeavours to preserve, though with the apparent hazard of our lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>And we doe hereby invite all Good Subiects, Especi∣ally our brethren the Sea Commanders, Marriners, and Seamen, unto a serious consideration of their severall and respective duties, unto these mentioned, great Interests, and conjure them with us vigorously to prosecute so ho∣nest and honourable ends, unto which both God, Nature, and their so oft iterated Oaths, (then which nothing can more awe a good Christian) most firmly bind them and from which, without manifest sinning against their owne Consciences, and the apparent losse even of their soules (which God forbid) they can no wayes recede; Especi∣cially when their Adherence unto so good and just ends, may probably put a full period unto the present miseries of this distressed Kingdome, or notably contribute unto so good a work; to provoke and annimate them unto the undertaking whereof with us, let them look upon the most deploreable condition of the present affaires in this Kingdome, let them behold the Protestant Religion, (in the religious exercise whereof God so mightily blessed our Kingdom, in the reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 6. in the happie dayes of never to be forgotten Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and in the good dayes of K. <HI>Iames</HI> of blessed memory) cast out of
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>doores, and almost quite overgrown with Schismes and Heresies.</P>
<P>Behold his sacred Maiestie, most disloyallie, and trea∣cherously cast into prison, and strictest durance; debarred the free exercise of his Religion, deprived of the society of his beloved Queen, the comfort of his deare children, the attendance of his faithfull servants: Behold our Liber∣ties trampled upon, and trodden underfoot, by the Ar∣bitrary power of a party, supported by force, and an Ar∣mie of Sectaries, who have raised Excises, Taxations, free Quarter, and other unsupportable burthens upon us.</P>
<P>Look upon the universal decay of forraign trade, wherby this Island so much flourished, and became rich and po∣tent above all Isles, and a wonder and an Amazement un∣to the whole world: what Country so ever we came to trade withall, we found this to be true: And now wee beseech you Brethren, to look upon the sad and ill favou∣red countenance of things amongst our selves, and how many families in our profession, are almost, or altogether impoverished, by the decay of forraign Traffique, and Trade, which is in a present possibility to be quite lost unto us and our whole Nation, and to be seized upon by Strangers. And that through the continuance of this most unnaturall war, which kept up, will bring utter ruin, and desolation unto this late flourishing Kingdom.</P>
<P>Two Armies are already entred into the Bowells of the Kingdom, and two more neare the entring, whence Trade both by Sea and Land will be so obstructed, that
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>it will be impossible to trade with any security, which as it will be unto the exceeding Impoverishment of the people of this Kingdome, so especially unto those of our profession.</P>
<P>Let us consider, that the persons from whom all these Evills come upon us, are some few in the House of Lords, and some of the House of Commons, and their <HI>Creatures, Excise-men, Farmers, Purchasers,</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> Lands, and the <HI>Committees</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and of the <HI>Coun∣tyes:</HI> Such as have cheated this Kingdome of many mil∣lions, and now fearing they should be called unto an ac∣count, will not be brought to heare of a personal Trea∣ty, or any course which may bring peace unto this mise∣rable Nation; Least their horrid Imposture, and Coz∣nage, wherewith they have abused the three King∣domes, should be reckoned for; to decline which by the Purse of the Commonwealth, (which they com∣mand) they maintain an Army of desperate Sectaries, to uphold themselves, and oppresse our Religion, King, and Kingdome.</P>
<P>There is no way, or meanes under Heaven, left you or us, to restore peace unto this afflicted Kingdom, to restore our Religion unto its auncient lusture and beauty his Ma∣jesty unto his Rights, and our selves unto our libertyes, then by adhereing unto his highnesse the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who is willing to venture his dearest blood to preserve ours; nay there is no other way left unto you to save your Soules; For if you will not keep inviolable your just Oathes, you run the Hazard of certaine damnation, The
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>Consideration whereof is fearfull, and calls upon you for a present resolution: Which if such as becomes you, you will forthwith repair unto the Navy, and Fleet with his highnes Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> &amp; in the best manner you may, tender your loyall Services unto him, for the good Ends mentioned, which if you shall do, assure your selves, you shall not only performe an Act exceedingly acceptable unto his Majesty, and his Highnesse, worthy of your selves and most desired by us; but also pleasing unto God, as being your bounden duty, what he requires at your hands, and the neglect whereof he will grievously punish.</P>
<P>This duty of your loyallty we expect from you, and if you shall any wayes decline it, know assuredly, that as we are able, so we are resolved to debar you of all benefit of forraign trade, and to deale with you as professed Ene∣mies unto your King, and Country, the very thought whereof ought to be most odious unto every honest man, and contrary unto whom we doubt not, you will always shew your selves.</P>
