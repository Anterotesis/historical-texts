<P>IT was this Consideration that gave birth to the Ad∣venture of the Renowned <HI>Columbus,</HI> That the parts of the Earth and Sea discovered, made up but half the Globe: And he could not imagine that the Wisdom of the Creator would design so vast a Compass as must make up the other part only for Fishes to inhabit Ʋpon this principle of reason, which carried with it a great proba∣bility of Success, He first solicited <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England;</HI> but being denied there, he made his Address to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> who by the perswasion of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Queen set out a small number of Ships, which after some Months sailing Westward (not with∣out the murmurings and despair of the Seamen) at length discovered an unknown, yet habitable World.
<PB REF="5"/>This Success of <HI>Columbus</HI> sounded by the Trump of Fame awakened the sloathful and incredulous <HI>World,</HI> who before would believe nothing possible but what their eyes could behold, or their outward senses fa∣thom: The <HI>World</HI> thus awakened, and having wiped their eyes with the <HI>Gold</HI> of <HI>COLUMBINA,</HI> saw more clearly their former Errors: Now the <HI>Golden-Age</HI> returns again <HI>Gold</HI> is exchanged for trifles, such as Knives, Hatchets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were valued at six times their weight in Gold; and Pearls, and Diamonds bear but an equal value with glass: But this lasted not long; for immediately such multitudes of Ships lanched out with expectations of gain, that they soon exhausted the discovered <HI>Mines,</HI> and reduced it almost to an equal value with that of <HI>Europe.</HI>

Several Discoveries was made, so that none lost their labour; and since that time many places have been dis∣covered, and yet there remains above a fourth part undiscovered; this gave me encouragement to take upon me this Adventure, though not without great trouble and care, such as the want of many Necessaries for my self and Seamen, which were much afflicted with a de∣sperate Sickness, that did deprive me of most of them; but I accidentally met with a vessel that lent me some of her men, which gave me greater encouragement to pro∣ceed in my <HI>Discovery,</HI> which Divine Providence did bless with success; for in four days after I came out of <HI>Fretum le Mair,</HI> I discovered the Land, which in the following Treatise I give you a relation of.</P>
<P>I do not doubt but this Discovery will be beneficial to <HI>Europe</HI> many ways; first as it may encourage several others to proceed in the like Adventures which may happi∣ly find out other Lands, and likewise these particular Islands may be beneficial, they being very fruitful, not over-peopled; abounding with many rich Mines, besides Pearls and precious Stones, with many other rich Com∣modities. The Inhabitants are a people very humane, witty, and intelligent, ready to receive any Instructions, and may be easily brought to Traffick.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> A Voyage from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> into the Southern Sea.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>January</HI> 1, 1669, We set Sail from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in the Vessel called the <HI>Flying-Faulcon:</HI> The Design of our Voyage be∣ing wholly Discovery. We made way to the <HI>Southern Sea;</HI> the twentieth of <HI>August</HI> following we came to the Streights of <HI>Magalan;</HI> and on the twenty sixth we had a sight of <HI>Terra del Fuega,</HI> by
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>which we Coasted three or four days, and then left; passing through <HI>Fretum le Mair</HI> into the Main-Ocean called <HI>Mare del Zur:</HI> on the sixth of <HI>September</HI> fol∣lowing we took an Observation, and found our selves in the Latitude of fifty degrees fourteen mi∣nutes. The Wind at East and by South; we sailed directly before the Wind; and on the tenth of <HI>September</HI> in the Evening we discovered Fire, an assured testimony of some Land: but early in the Morning we were better c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>firmed in our belief, being in sight of the very Land, and within a mile or thereabouts of it: we Coasted along several days, and could spy no Towns or Houses, but discovered many good Ports and Promontaries. On the thir∣tieth of <HI>September</HI> we discovered another piece of Land separate from this by a River or <HI>Fretum,</HI> a League and half in breadth. We still continued our Discovery by Coasting along this Land likewise. About the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> following we came to the other end of the <HI>Fretum</HI> before disco∣vered, by which we knew it to be an Island that we had discovered, and by computation Judg both the Islands to be in Compass about three hundred Leagues: we ventured into this <HI>Fretum,</HI> and at our entrance, I gave it the name of <HI>Fretum del Schooten.</HI> As we passed along we could discover on the Banks, Peo∣ple of an extraordinary size, and hairy: Having sailed about seven Leagues we discovered a River running Eastward up into the first Island; into this River we ventured, and having sailed about a mile, we discovered a Town (as we supposed by the great quantity of Smoak that ascended from thence); at
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>length drawing nearer to it we espied Houses, or rather Hills as they seemed to us by their Grass-Coverings; before this Town we cast Anchor, and made an Observation, and found our selves in the Latitude of fifty Degrees thirteen Minutes, South; and the Longitude Two hundred seventy five De∣grees thirty Minutes. We had not rid at Anchor above three hours before we could espy a <HI>Canoo</HI> coming over to us from the Town; the reason of which we could not well apprehend; at length draw∣ing near to us, we espied in it an <HI>European,</HI> as his Complexion and Habit did show; he had in his hand a shattered torn Jack-flag, in which we might dis∣cover something of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Arms: Being come to the Ship-side, he saluted us with these words, <HI>Dios vos guarda hermanos;</HI> which in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> language signifies, <HI>God save you my Brethren:</HI> I then returned his Salutation in his own language, saying, <HI>Sea bien veni do Hermano.</HI> Welcome Brother; and invited him into the Ship: which Invitation he wil∣lingly accepted, and came into the Ship; our Seamen would have taken the men in the <HI>Canoo</HI> into the Ship, but he would not suffer them, telling us they were Slaves, and ought not to be so much Countenanced: We took this <HI>Portuguese</HI> into the great Cabin, and gave him the best Entertainment our Ship could afford; after three or four hours stay in our Ship, he took his leave, and gave us an Invitation to his House, which he told us was in that Town we saw; and promised likewise to send <HI>Canoo's</HI> for the whole Ship's Com∣pany, which he accordingly performed in the Mor∣ning following.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
The Natives that Rowed in the <HI>Canoo's</HI> were all hairy, having no other Cloathing than what Nature had furnished them withall; and the least of them by computation above Eleven foot high; by these Gygan∣tick men, we were safely conducted to the Town, which consisted of about a thousand Houses, built of Timber, and covered over the top with Boughs of Trees wreathed together; and over them were placed very curiously Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensads, which make their Houses look like so many Hills covered with Grass.</P>
<P>At length we were Conducted to this <HI>Portuguese</HI> House, who it seems was Governour of this Town, and <HI>Cacique,</HI> or King of that part of the Country: His House was built after the same manner with the rest, bur much bigger.</P>
<P>At the Entrance to his House he received us with a great deal of Expressions of Joy, and conducted us into a very fair Room, where we were plentifully entertained with roasted Venison, and Wine in abun∣dance</P>
<P>Having pretty well satisfied our selves, he dis∣coursed with us concerning our Adventures, and re∣lated to us the manner of his Adventures, since his coming from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> after this manner.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> The Adventures of <HI>Vasques de Pagna,</HI> from the year <HI>1646,</HI> to November <HI>1670;</HI> as it was related by himself to <HI>Henry Schooten.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Vasques de Pagna</HI> set sail from <HI>Lisbon</HI> in the year One thousand six hundred forty-six, upon the same account that you did from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and by accident made this Island: being curious in the Discovery, I first Coasted about the two Islands, and then put into the <HI>Fretum,</HI> that parts the two Islands; and observing this River that runs up into the Country, I ventured into it; resolving to venture so far till I could see either Houses or Inhabitants; but by the neglect of my Mate, not being careful enough in sounding the Channel, my Ship unfortu∣nately struck upon a Sand, and split in a very short time, giving us little space to shift for our lives; in this streight every Man endeavouring to save himself, my self with two more got safe to the Shore; but of the rest of our Company I never could hear of since, and therefore conclude they were all drowned. We sought about for shelter from the Cold and Rain, it being about the time of the Winter-Solstice, at which time it is rather Colder than it is with you in <HI>Europe.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>At length we found a large hollow Tree, into which we entred, and slept for that night.</P>
<P>The next Morning as soon as we could see, we went to the Water-side to see whether any thing was driven a shore, or floated near to Land; when we came there we espied several pieces of our Ship floa∣ting about; and walking along by the shore we found a Barrel of Bisket, and near to that our Jack-Flag, both which we took up and went away very joyfully towards our Arbour, where we secured them, and gave thanks to God for his great mercy in making such Provision for us: Upon this Bisket we lived a∣bout three Months, and spent our time in Prayers, and walking the Grounds near to the Tree, retreating upon the least noise to our Harbour: In the second Month one of my Companions fell sick and died, and at three Months end my other Companion.</P>
<P>Now was I left in a miserable Condition, my Com∣pany dead, and my Victuals almost spent; but how∣ever I comforted my self with these thoughts, that the same God that hitherto had so plentifully provi∣ded for me, would still take care of me; I now resol∣ved to travel up farther into the Country, and if there were any Inhabitants (for as yet I had seen none) to commit my self to their mercy; being thus resolved, I thought to leave some Memorial behind me, that if it should happen that any <HI>European</HI> should light upon this place, they might know what Adventure I had made; I therefore took the Jack-Flag, and with a black-lead Pencil writ these Words as plain as I could, <HI>Vasques de Pagna of Lisbon was here;</HI> and then secured it in a convenient place in the Tree,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>where it might be secure from the injuries of weather. Then I took the remainder of the Bisket, and desired God to prosper my Journey, and travelled into the Country.</P>
<P>In two days travel I discovered hairy people, such as you see; at first I was something fearful of them, but my fear was soon taken away, for I found them to be more fearful of me, admiring at my Clothes and Complexion; and were ready to adore me. Walking a little further, I could espy, as it were, a grove of Hills which were their Houses, whose pleasant Ver∣dure was very delightful; being come near to the Town, I was surrounded with hundreds of these Hairy-people, admiring me, and making offers to adore me, supposing I was a god; but I did what I could to hinder them. At length it came to the King's ear, who came himself with several Priests to visit me, and made signs to me to let them know what I was; first lifting up their eyes to Heaven, and then pointing to me, and then to the Heavens again; but I let them understand by the like signs, that I did not come immediately from Heaven, but hoped to go thither; and this I did by first pointing to the Earth from whence I came, and to the Heavens whe∣ther I hoped to go. With which they were well satis∣fied, and conducted me to the <HI>Caciques</HI> House (for so they call their Kings): The <HI>Cacique</HI> telling his Priest (as I have been since informed by his Daughter my Wife) that I was of Coelestial Extract, and fit for no Company but the Gods and Kings. At this Palace I fared very well; and having very small hopes of returning to my Country, or seeing any of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>I thought it my best way to assure my self of a Being amongst them, and this I did by ingratiating my self with the <HI>Cacique</HI>'s Daughter, whom I found very ready to receive any kindness from me; her Father likewise casting a pleasant aspect on both, did give me encouragement to make some offers of Amours, which was kindly received, and we in a short time married according to the Custom of the Countrey; of which with their other Rites and Customs, I shall give you a full account hereafter. Being married, he gave me Two hundred Slaves, and bid me chuse out a place in the Island to inha∣bit, and build a Town that might be called by my Name.</P>
<P>Having taken my leave, I with my Wife and Slaves with store of all sorts of Provision, came towards this place, which I the rather made choice of, because it was the place I formerly had taken possession of; likewise hoping, that being near to this River, some <HI>European</HI> might at some time or o∣ther happen to sail into it, as I had done.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> A Continuation of the Relation, with the manner of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> treat∣ing us.</HEAD>
<P>HAving given us this relation of his Adventure, he carried us and shewed us the hollow Tree they first lodged in, which stands at the entrance to his House, painted with a sort of red Paint, like to our <HI>Oker,</HI> but much brighter colour; with which Commodity that part of the Countrey doth much abound: Then he carried us, and shewed us the places where he formerly had buried his Companions, over whose Bodies he had caused to be erected <HI>Py∣ramids,</HI> covered with Moss, and curiously checker∣ed with Boughs of Trees woven together cross∣wise. Having done this, he carried us into a stately large Room, whose Wall instead of Tapistry was bedeck't with Flowers and growing Moss, and chec∣ker'd with Boughs after the manner of the <HI>Pyramids</HI> (before mentioned); on the upper end of which, on a Seat or Bank, sate his Lady with Four Children; his Lady was near Twelve Foot high, his Eldest Son, about Twenty years of age, was more than Twelve foot; his Second Son about Six∣teen years of age, above Ten foot; his two Daugh∣ters
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>younger, one was Nine foot, and the other Seven foot in heighth. But that which was most re∣markable, was, that his Second Son and Eldest Daugh∣ter were smooth as we are, and yet retained the Nature of the Countrey as to height.</P>
<P>Being pretty well satisfied with our entertainment and diversions, we desired his leave to return to our ship, but he would not grant it, telling us that we should lye there that night; and then conducted us into another large Room, wherein was Hammocks provided for us to lye upon; here he treated us again with two or three Movyles of Wine, (which Mo∣vyle contained about a Gallon); having drank up our Wine, he bid us good-night, and left us to our repose.</P>
<P>Next morning as soon as Sun was up, he came to us, and asked us how we slept, and called for a Movyle of Wine for our Morning's-draught, and cau∣sed likewise some Venison to be brought to us, with which having broke our fast, he carried us to see his Town, and the Church which he had built. He told us, at his first coming to this place he was both King and Priest. And that he had converted his Wife, and had baptized her and all the inhabitants of the place, being all as his domestick Servants; but since, the people encreasing, he had constituted other Priests. After this discourse in the Church, we returned to his House, where he gave order for a Dinner to be provided for us, in the mean time he entertained us with a farther relation of the Govern∣ment and Customs of this Island in these words following.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> Of the Government, Religion, and Customs of the Inhabitants: With the nature of the Soil, and the several Commodi∣ties of the Island <HI>Benganga.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Island wherein you are, is called by the Na∣tives <HI>Benganga,</HI> Governed this thousand years by the Family of <HI>Gangois,</HI> of which Family my Fa∣ther-in-law is; who is called by the name of <HI>Conum∣bro Bengangois:</HI> his chief seat is <HI>Cubugnello,</HI> the Town where I was Entertained and Married. He is the Ab∣solute Monarch of the Island, and hath Fourty petty Kings that live about him, that do Homage, and pay Tribute to him yearly.</P>
<P>They worship in all parts of this Island, except mine, the Devil, who appears to them very often in a misty cloud, uttering or mumbling out some words concerning his will; which if they do not punctually perform, some great misfortune happens, either to them or their Children soon after. They believe that they that live well here, and do no man any injury, and obey the Laws of the <HI>Cacique,</HI> they shall enjoy much happiness after death, in pleasant fields, behind the Hills. At three times of the year they offer Sacri∣fices to their <HI>Dieu</HI> (as they call him) who appears in a
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>Cloud upon a high Mountain all the time of their Sa∣crificing; and these Sacrifices are sometimes Goats, and sometime Children.</P>
<P>Their manner of Marriage is in this manner: The Parents of both parties being first agreed, the Father of the Maid brings out his Daughter to the Young∣man, and they immediately upon the first sight de∣clare to their Patents their liking or refusal of each other; if they declare their liking, the Father of the Damosel in the presence of one of their <HI>Fritazeers,</HI> or Priests, gives his Daughter to the Young-man, and with her gives her Dowry, which is one or more Ser∣vants, according to his ability and their former agree∣ment; after this the <HI>Fritazeer</HI> offers a Sacrifice to the <HI>Dieu,</HI> and the Marriage is celebrated. They are here allowed to have but one Wife; and if either die, they are not permitted to marry again: Both Men and Women here are very chast and temperate in meat and drink: Their Women are not so fruitful as in <HI>Europe,</HI> it being a rare thing for one to see four Children in a Family. Theft and Murder are here severely punish∣ed with cruel Tortures unto death; so that a stranger may safely travel in this Island without fear of harm, except it be from Bears which lurk in the Woods, with which this Island is well stored.</P>
<P>The Commodities of this Island are Saunders, Palm-trees, Konock a sort of paint, Cassanack a kind of Pults of which they make their bread; great plen∣ty of Goats and Deer, Fowl of several sorts, Fish in abundance, Otters and Beevers good store. Here are also several Gold and Silver Mines, but they are not much regarded by the Inhabitants, they adorning them∣selves
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>more with Pearl and Amber, with which this Country is well stored. Their Drink is Palm-Wine, which they make after this manner: They bore a hole in the tree, and put into the hole a hollow Cane, and at the end of the tap they hang a vessel to catch the liquor: in an hours time if the Tree be any thing large, there will run out a gallon; this liquor is fit to drink presently, and is very pleasant and spiritous, intoxi∣cating the brain, as soon as the most generous Wine in <HI>Europe;</HI> here are several acres of ground yearly plan∣ted with these Trees, which serve for the use afore∣said. They have here a certain Tree which they call <HI>Cocotonuch,</HI> of the Bark of which they weave a Cloth which serves them for Hammocks and Mantles which they use in the Winter time; it being full as cold, or colder about <HI>June</HI> as it is in <HI>Europe</HI> in <HI>December.</HI> The people here by reason of their Temperance and Cha∣stity live longer than they do in <HI>Europe;</HI> the genera∣lity of them living till they are a Hundred and twenty, or a Hundred and fifty years of age: The like reason might be given for their extraordinary stature.</P>
<P>The Women here are very comely, and well fea∣tured; their faces indifferently smooth, but the Men are so rough and hairy in the face, that they look like so many Island-shocks.</P>
<P>Thus having given you an account of the Country in general, I shall give a particular account of my own Jurisdiction.</P>

<P>THis part of the Island that you are now in, is called by me <HI>Terra de Pagna</HI> after my own name. My Government and Laws are of two sorts, after the man∣ner of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> viz. Ecclesiastical and Civil: My eldest Son I have made Judg in all Civil matters; and my second Son in Ecclesiastical: The Ten Com∣mandments is the rule of our Government; the Lords Prayer and Creed the rule and foundation of our De∣votion: These things I have taught them in their own language, and they have them so imprinted in their memory, that I think there is no person in my bounds that is above ten years of age, but will readily repeat them.</P>
<P>The Limits of my Jurisdiction is ten Leagues round from the River. In it are four Towns near so big as this, governed by Deputies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VI.</HI> A Continuation of the Relation.</HEAD>
<P>HEre he was interrupted, notice being given that Dinner was ready, unto which we was conducted: Here was a noble Entertainment, with Venison of se∣veral sorts, Fowl plenty, and Wine in abundance; his Lady and Children honouring us with their Com∣pany. During our sitting at Dinner, his Lady who had learnt to speak <HI>Portuguese,</HI> made several Enquiries of us concerning <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> asking us if <HI>Europe</HI> was as big as this World she lived in? We told her, That this place was as small in comparison of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> as this Town was to the whole Island of <HI>Ben∣ganga.</HI> After this manner we discoursed, till night drawing near, put us in mind of going to our Ship; we therefore earnestly desired leave to depart, which the Governour very unwillingly granted, but made us promise that (if God would permit) we would re∣turn again, or at least acquaint the <HI>European</HI> World with this place, and more especially his own Coun∣try; desiring them to send over some Religious men to assist him in planting the Gospel amongst these mi∣serably deluded people.</P>
<P>Thus we took our leave, and came to our Ship, where we reposed for that night, and the next mor∣ning
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>weighed Anchor and hoised our Sails, and de∣parted, saluting the Town with all our Guns, which we suppose put the Natives into some fright, not being acquainted vvith those noises. As we passed along the <HI>Fretum</HI> we espied some few hairy men of the same stature with those of <HI>Benganga.</HI> Passing by a great Marsh, where there was no danger of Ambush, we ventured ashore, and struck down our Ancient in to∣ken of possession, giving it the name of <HI>Coma,</HI> by reason of the Hairy Inhabitants. Having done this, we came again to our Ship, and in Ten Months time arrived at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> sufficiently satisfied with our Discovery.</P>
<P>This is a true Relation of our Voyage and Disco∣very.</P>

<HEAD>An APPENDIX. The Qualifications of such as under∣take a Voyage for Discovery: With several Precepts to be observed by them.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> Of their Qualifications.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, It is requisite that they be men of middle age, of a good healthy Constitution, all their Senses firm, and in their full vigour, that they may be able to go through any dangers or hazards that may happen to them in such an uncertain Ad∣adventure.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="15"/>
II. They must be well skill'd in the Arts of Arith∣metick, Geometry, Gunnery and Fortification, Tri∣gonometry, Astronomy, and Navigation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> Precepts to be observed by such as under∣take these Adeventures.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, Let them be provided with a good strong Ship, store of Provision, Weapons defensive and offensive, with a sufficient quantity of Ammunition, and convenient Instruments for prospection and ob∣servation.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let the Seamen be healthy, stout, resolute Blades, such as are resolved against all dangers that may happen.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let them be very curious in their Observati∣ons, and calculate the Longitude and Latitude of all places they touch at.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Let them keep their Journal-book exactly; truly and faithfully recording all the passages of the Voyage, as the several changings of the Wind; the rumbs and distance of sailing upon those rumbs; the true sounding of the Channels in those Harbours they enter, and what rocks or sands they meet with, giving some necessary rules and cautions for shunning those dangers.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let them carefully observe the variation of the Compass, with the Currents, and trade-Winds.</P>
<P N="6"><PB REF="15"/>
VI. Let them use their utmost endeavour to un∣derstand the Religion, Customs, Manners, and Com∣modities, with the Inclinations of the Inhabitants, and commit it to writing, that they may give a true acccount of them when they return home.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Let them be curious in observing the Clouds; by the clearness of them whereof, they may know when they draw near to land: for by their passing over the land, wanting a supply of Vapours, the Clouds become more white and clear, as <HI>Columbus</HI> observed and ex∣perienced.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. "When in the day-time they observe the Clouds gathering together in heaps near the Hori∣zon, looking blew, and a section appear on that part of the Hemisphere, or by night discover fire, they may be certain they are approaching to land.</P>
<P N="9">IX. When they come near to the land, let them first coast along by it, and curiously observe the Creeks and Harbours, their manner of bearing, with their forms or figures.</P>
<P N="10">X. When they have coasted so long that they are sufficiently satisfied of the figure and situation of the place, and have found out a convenient River, either broad enough to secure them from any attempt the Natives may make upon them from shore; or else whose banks are distant from Woods or other Am∣busheado's.</P>
<P N="11">XL. When they find an opportunity to venture a∣shore, let them go well armed, that they may awe the Natives; who when they see their store, or bon∣pointed arrows do not pierce them, as they do their own Country-men, will be ready to offer divine ado∣ration
<PB REF="16"/>to them; but let them be very prudent in this case; neither absolutely hindering it, yet modestly denying such adoration, by pointing to the heavens, letting them know there they ought to pay their devotion; for by absolutely hindring their Adoration, they thinking you to be men, will make other attempts upon you, as the <HI>Indians</HI> did upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at their first coming thither, by holding them so long under water till they were confirmed they were mortal.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Let them be very careful when they are per∣mitted to traffick, and live quietly amongst the Na∣tives, that they shew good examples to them by their good lives and conversations; let them be just in all their dealings, punctual to their promise, and civil to the Natives in general.</P>
