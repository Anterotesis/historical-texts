<OPENER><SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He mutuall complaints of the <HI>Turky Company</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> late Embassador in <HI>Turky,</HI> being eminently publique; and many scandals being cast upon the Merchants, and upon the present Embassador, by private whispers of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> and his Agents: It is become even necessary to expose the following papers to publique view; being the copies of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sac. Crowes Warrants, Instructions</HI> and <HI>Letters</HI> to his Agents, and of some of their <HI>Returnes:</HI> together with the <HI>Factors letters</HI> unto the Company here; giving an account of his attempts against them.</P>
<P>And whosoever shall esteeme it worth his time to be truly informed of the matters in difference, as they depended before the late, and this present Parliament; may collect from these Papers, the true state of the controversie: The most materiall of which are confes∣sed by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> before a Committee of Parlia∣ment, to have passed under his own hand and Seale; and the others also will be as easily proved.</P>
<P>But be pleased first to understand the relation be∣tween the <HI>Levant</HI> (or <HI>Turky</HI>) Company and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow.</HI> He was first employed in the yeare 1638. as Embassador or Agent to Constantinople: and although he was dignified (as was usual) with the title of the Kings Embassador or Resident, and his Commission; yet it was not an Embassy upon matters of State, there being only Capitulations and peace for freedom of Trade between the Turkes and the English; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> under that honorable name, was the Levant Com∣panies Agent or publique Minister, upon severall agree∣ments and covenants mutually passed between them:
<PB REF="3"/> and as Their Agent only, the Company paid for the transportation and provision of himselfe, his <HI>Lady,</HI> and all his retinue: and also gave him Sixe hundred pounds as advance, for the furniture and ornament of his house at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> and covenanted to allow him a year∣ly Salary of neere Two thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which was paid him quarterly beforehand. And He covenanted <HI>to take care of the publique good of the Companies trade,</HI> and impartially <HI>to see it ordered by the rules and orders made by them:</HI> and <HI>to assist their Treasurer to cause the costs and charges of any Avania,</HI> (or Turkish charge upon fictitious pretences) <HI>that should happen upon a Nationall cause, to be borne by all the Company of Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs there, in indifferent proportions, as their Treasurer and the English nation there should thinke fit:</HI> and <HI>that he should not exact any Levy of moneys, or forcibly take the goods or moneys of any of the Traders there, upon any pretence what∣soever without the Companies order under Seale.</HI> This was the summe and substance of the trust reposed by the Company in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> (with some other things less materiall) to which he was obliged by Articles under his hand and seale.</P>
<P>Now the most gross, palpable and infamous breach of this publique trust, to the high dishonour of the En∣glish nation in the eyes of Turkes and Infidels, and to the utmost hazard of the loss and ruine of a very im∣portant part of the English Trade, and of the lives and fortunes of many of the English Nation, This is the subject matter of the Levant Companies complaint against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow:</HI> and the following Papers speak enough to be sufficient proof on their behalfe: from these every judicious eye may collect cleere evidence, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> did not only cast aside <HI>that care of the publique good of the Companies trade, and observing their
<PB REF="3"/> rules and orders,</HI> unto which he was obliged by Covenant; But also that he assumed and usurped to himselfe an absolute arbitrary power over all the Companies Estates in Turky, and their Factors Persons; and to be their absolute and supreme Judge even in his own case; and that he demeaned himselfe, as if he had been absol∣ved from all his Covenants; pursuing by all undue meanes of force and fraud his private interest, to the ruine of the Trade. And to make these Papers speake in method and order, be pleased (good Reader) to ob∣serve from them,</P>
<P N="1">1. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crowes Secret designe;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See page 15. 19 32. 47. 53. 55.</NOTE> as himselfe calls it, to his own Servants.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Disguises</HI> he cunningly deviseth to cover the frighting Deformity of it, at least untill he had compas∣sed it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Meanes</HI> directed and ordered by him, for the effecting his designe.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>proceedings</HI> he made towards <HI>the Execution</HI> of his designe, before the English in Turky could avoid his oppression.</P>
<P N="1">I. First, the Warrants, Instructions and Letters given under S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackviles</HI> hand and seale, to his servants <HI>John Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo Zuma</HI> discover with open face, that he designed <HI>to make himselfe Master of all the English Estates in Turky.</HI> The very words of his se∣cond Warrant are these,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">See Page 8.</NOTE> <HI>We hereby inorder sequestra∣tion of all moneys, Merchandizes and other goods and faculties whatsoever within the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minions of the Grand Signor where∣ever belonging to the members of the said Company in the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There was a Shedule of 64 names which had all the con∣siderable estates there. vid. fol.</NOTE> <HI>Schedule annexed; Requiring you to boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and enter all Ships and Vessels, and to breake open and enter into all and every the Houses, Ware-houses and Compting-houses of all and every the said parties; and to take, carry away, and put into safe
<PB REF="4"/> custody, all such moneys, Merchandize, goods and other facul∣ties of what nature soever, that you shall discover, find out and get into your power &amp;c.</HI> And in his letter to Hethering∣ton, he commands him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Page 33.</NOTE> <HI>to hinder Jorden and all other Masters of ships from lading, till he was Master of what he aymed at.</HI> And in another letter to Hetherington, he tells him thus;<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Page 49.</NOTE> <HI>You have order for rendring into your possession all goods aboard the Ships, belonging to any of our Nation; for if it be for any English, I care not for whom, or if by any English laden, I care not by whom, sequester it.</HI></P>
<P>And his intentions to graspe at no lesse then all, may appeare, not only by the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">21. 49. 51. 55.</NOTE> <HI>private carriage of his designe,</HI> enjoyning his Agents<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> <HI>that no creature should know any part thereof; Noe</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> <HI>not the French Druggerman em∣ployed by him in discovering the Merchants Estates:</HI> But by his express Instructions to them,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">16. 42. 47. 48. 54.</NOTE> <HI>to possesse themselves of what they could,</HI> without limitation: <HI>and</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Page 55.</NOTE> <HI>to exspect his further orders for the time of their seizing or plundering all there, that He might fall on to doe the same (which he called His worke) at Constantinople at the same time.</HI> And in ano∣ther letter to Lorenzo and Hetherington, he tells them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Page 44.</NOTE> <HI>He is advised of an English Ship arrived about Smyrna, which by advice from within rides without, and resolves for Scanderone, and to discharge and relade there; But he hoped to get a command for the Chiaus to secure that other Corner also.</HI> And the same letters also give cleere evidence that his further designe was, to transport himselfe and the English estates he could swallow, out of Turky into some other forraine Nati∣on; As in another letter to his complices,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Page 33. 85.</NOTE> <HI>Upon your advice, I shall make use of some one of these Ships here, to transport my Wife and family, and provide for the rest in time.</HI></P>
<P>And he<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">31. 32.</NOTE> severall times orders his Agents to agree with shipping at high rates, to transport the goods he
<PB REF="4"/> had plundered from the English. And the Reader may observe in severall passages<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">22. 24. 83.</NOTE> how highly S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sack∣vile</HI> was inraged at the stealing any English goods aboard, or the departure of any ship: He esteeming it all to be lost out of his purse; having swallowed in his hopes the whole English estate in that Empire. And he was so confident in the face of the Sun to avow <HI>the making himselfe a fortune</HI> upon the Companies estates there (for that was his sole, and utmost end what ever may now be suggested)<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">6. 7. 8. 74. 80. 81.</NOTE> That he demanded of the Fa∣ctors at once, <HI>Twenty five thousand pounds</HI> Sterling, for his Estate which he said was sequestred in England; and neere <HI>Ten thousand pounds</HI> Sterling for his hopes of future profits by his Embassy for seven years: and tells them that <HI>untill they had paid it him, neither their Persons nor Estates should be free; for he had vowed to God at the last Sacrament to sacrifice his Estate, Himselfe, Wife and Children, for the execution of this his absolute intent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly, these following Papers will shew the <HI>Disguises</HI> which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> invented and practi∣sed, for the more plausible carrying on this his grand and black Designe. First, he imposed a <HI>Leviation</HI> or taxe upon the English Estates, of <HI>a Hundred and ten thousand Dollars;</HI> under colour of a necessity for so much to satisfy the Companies debts: Requiring the same to be paid in <HI>ready money,</HI> when he told his Agents<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">15. 16.</NOTE> he knew it to be impossible; whom yet he instructed <HI>to take no security,</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> <HI>no not all the Nation for one mans taxe:</HI> Nei∣ther would he allow any time, when the Factors would submit to his Leviation, if they might have time to raise the money: But in pursuance of his secret Designe, he gives out Warrants and Instructions to <HI>Enter Warehouses and Comptinghouses, and seize upon all Goods, Money and Mer∣chandizes;</HI> that thereby he might not only have occa∣sion
<PB REF="5"/> to begin to rifle the English Estates, but to <HI>Discover</HI> them; and this with less odium and scandall from the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Iewes,</HI> and with more assistance from the <HI>Turkish</HI> officers, then would have bin, if his secret De∣signe had been fallen upon bare-faced. Yet to make it beyond dispute, that This was only intended in order to the designe of swallowing up all; The Reader may please to observe that this Leviation was and is by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> himselfe acknowledged to be a<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">15. 16. 16. 18. 19. 47. 48.</NOTE> Colour: His Agents being ordered<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE> to make that the ground∣worke of all their other worke; and<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE> not to discover his owne pretences till the last. As also that some of the Factors, hoping to prevent his further oppression, made tender of their part of the Leviation in money to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> himselfe; and he refused it, and gave order to his Agents at Smyrna,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE> <HI>to arrest the person and goods of</HI> Mr. Daniell Edwards, <HI>that offered it, notwithstan∣ding his tender of his money;</HI> and said <HI>he longed to have him in his power.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Brandon,</HI> another of the Factors, offering likewise his part, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> refu∣sed it, unless he would discover where all his Estate re∣mained; which M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Brandon</HI> denying, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> sends for his Broker, commanding a discovery from him, as also from M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>James Mudiford:</HI> But they still refusing, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> vowed that if it were between Heaven and Earth he would find it out: &amp; thereupon, on S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackviles</HI> command, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Brandon</HI> was clapt in Chaines. Nay<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">30. 34.</NOTE> <HI>the full of the Leviation would not be accepted:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">40. 48.</NOTE> Nor being paid, might the Factors be afterwards at liberty to lade their goods; But<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">29. 30.</NOTE> still his instruments are directed to seize. And this first disguise of a Leviation, carried Two more in his bowels; The one was, a seizure of more goods for charges, when they had enough double and treble for the Leviation; and those he set at 36000
<PB REF="5"/> Dollars: The other was to appraise the goods his A∣gents should Seize, at halfe values; That when his new pretences for his secret Designe should come, he might not want colour for swallowing up the whole.</P>
<P>The next maske of his designe was a meere fained pretence<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Page 7</NOTE> that the Parliament had sequestred his Estate in England, by the companies procurement; and therefore He would repaire himselfe out of theirs in Turky: and then he values his Estate at 297000 Dol∣lars (neere 80000 pound sterling) whereas it is belei∣ved that he had not a visible Estate to 3000 pound Value.</P>
<P>An other pretence was,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">6. 7 29.</NOTE> a claime of 174000 Dol∣lars for Consulage due to him; although he had con∣tracted under hand and Seale with the Company <HI>to assist in collecting that money for Them, to be paid to Their Treasurer;</HI> That being the usuall Receipt out of which the Com∣pany defray the extraordinary Charge of the Embassa∣dor and other Ministers abroad. But as he instructed his servants about the seizing some of the Factors per∣sons,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">50. 51.</NOTE> <HI>to Make a pretence, if they could not find one, for</HI> (he said) <HI>it was all one to him,</HI> so the worke were done; So he practiseth himselfe to forge and invent pretences to devoure the Companies Estates; that his rapine and violence might not be seene unmasked, least they should have lost the opportunity to act it.</P>
<P N="3">III. Thirdly, Let the Reader observe from these papers what unhappy Meanes, suitable to his Ends, he found out for compassing his designe.</P>
<P N="1">1. By false insinuations to the Vizier, he procures countenance from him for an Embargo: And there∣upon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1. 4. 11. 23. 26. 39. 41. 45.</NOTE> <HI>he arrests all the ships of the English at Smirna and Constantinople; and prohibites also the Lading of any goods; and commands the persons of any that should presume to lade,
<PB REF="6"/> to be arrested; and those that could not be apprehended, to be proclaimed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">26. 35. 69.</NOTE> <HI>Rebells: and</HI> so he afterwardes styled most of the English Nation there. And he further com∣mands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">44. 45. 46.</NOTE> <HI>Accounts to be given to his Agents by the Masters of the ships, of all the goods on board; and they to enter into all Ships, Warehouses or Counting houses; and to take into their power all Bookes of Accompts, Bills of Debt, Acquittan∣ces, Letters, or other writings or evidence whatsoever belon∣ging to any English whatsoever; and the same to keepe and and make use of in evidence.</HI> Thus under<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Page 31. 33. 35.</NOTE> a feyned Co∣lour of command from that State, he practised to im∣mure the whole English Estate, that none might escape his fingers.</P>
<P N="2">2. He ordered Rewards and promises to be made and given to Informers (without reserving his Agents within any bounds) that they might discover the mo∣neys, goods and debts of the Company. And<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Page 16.</NOTE> He orders his servants <HI>to employ some Jew or Armenian Brokers (under pretence of Bargains) to discover the English Estates:</HI> And his Agents<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Page 58.</NOTE> make him returne to these Instructions, <HI>That they had employed the most cunning Rogues in all the Countrey, to see if they could discover any other part of the Nations Estate either hid or lying out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He ordered<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Page 10. 18. 20. 32. 35. 36. 41. 50.</NOTE> the Bribing of the <HI>Cady,</HI> the <HI>Neipe,</HI> the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> the <HI>Customer,</HI> and all the Turkish officers and in∣ferior ministers, to gaine their assistance in his designe: and herein he gives his Agents<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Page 21.</NOTE> <HI>Latitude without limit;</HI> and tells them againe and againe<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Page 10. 18. 19. 20. 41.</NOTE> <HI>That they must spare no Cost;</HI> assuring them <HI>they may charge</HI> 10000 <HI>Dollars upon him by bills for that use,</HI> and commands them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Page 52. 54.</NOTE> to <HI>pawne</HI> the goods they seaze, for the same end; That they might buy the Turkish Ministers to execute his cruelty upon the Factors, and helpe to possess him of the companies Estate. And to make his Agents most impudent and
<PB REF="6"/> fearless in what they did, he gives them assurance in a boasting manner<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Page 38.</NOTE> That the <HI>Merchants should never have right against them, so long as they themselves had any thing to bribe the contrary:</HI> and he bad them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Page 53.</NOTE> <HI>Value themselves and their service at what rate they pleased, and they should be recompensed.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. He ordered his Servants to ingratiate themselves with all the Turkes; who were apt to mutiny by see∣ing the horrid rapine and injustice executed upon the traders with whom they dealt: and therefore he com∣manded them to <HI>spare no charge</HI> in presents,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Page 18. 40. 63.</NOTE> to make the very Townsmen of their party; and to perswade them <HI>that all that was done, was intended for the better regulation and advance of Trade;</HI> which he said was only in his power to increase and regulate.</P>
<P N="5">5. And yet to Secure himselfe of the whole English Estate more certainly, he tooke care to prevent the interposition of the justice of the very Infidells, which he feared might protect the Merchants from his oppres∣sion: Therefore he informed the Vizier,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Page 26.</NOTE> that divers English ships were joyned with the Venetian Fleet, the Turkes Enemy, and attended to give Battle to the Grand Signiors Fleete: and also<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Page 82.</NOTE> that some ships had been Laden by the Merchants with Powder and prohibited goods, for the Enemies supplies: And<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Page 69.</NOTE> counsells his Servants at Smirna to procure from the Turkish Ministers there, most dangerous and false Cer∣tificates, <HI>That the Factors perswaded the people of the place to mutinie:</HI> By this meanes exposing the Factors per∣sons at least to Slavery in the Gallies, if not death by Torments, and the Companies Estates to a certaine confiscation; if the Vizier himselfe had not discerned his falseness and Avanious designes against his own Nation. And though his allegations had not full credit;
<PB REF="7"/> yet, by them he obstructed, at least for a time, the only meanes of releife which the factors could expect; hoping in the interim to make sure of most of their Estate.</P>
<P>Thus He that was employed and trusted cheifely (as occasion should happen) to mediate with the Grand Signor and his Ministers that the Capitulations be∣tween him and the English might be kept,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Capitula∣tions. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. 16.</NOTE> as sacred and inviolate; and that noe English Causes between themselves might be under the jurisdiction of the Tur∣kish Ministers (the Grand Signor having granted, for our Nations security, that his Officers should not inter∣meddle therein) Even He that was thus trusted, having designed to make his private fortunes out of the Com∣panies Estates; endeavoured to his utmost to bring all the Nation there, under the Tyranny of the Turkish Ministers; conjuring his Servants to make noe Scruple<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge 50.</NOTE> <HI>to use the Turkish ayde</HI> against the Merchants persons and Estates, whatever came of it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fourthly, These papers will give you an account what <HI>progresse</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> made in the <HI>Execution</HI> of his intended rapine.</P>
<P N="1">1. His Orders for arresting the Ships in port, tooke such unhappy effect, by his subtilty in gaining Impe∣riall Commands upon false suggestions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 78.</NOTE> that some ships were stayed in port neare 7 moneths; to an insuppor∣table damage of the Merchants.</P>
<P N="2">2. He actually<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">.</NOTE> forced the payment of 110000 Dollars, under colour of a Leviation: and also<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 80</NOTE> Bonds for 25000 Dollars, under colour of maintenance for himselfe and his family.</P>
<P N="3">3. His Servants prevailed so effectually with the Turkish officers, That * they seized and imprisoned, first the Consul and most principall of the Factors at
<PB REF="7"/> Smirna; and afterwards most of the rest: and with Bar∣barous cruelty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 91.</NOTE> haled the Consul and Sixe of the cheife of that factory to a darke and close Dungeon, with the doores and windowes nailed upon them, in the extreame heate of Summer: Where they had in probability perished, if the mercy of the Turkes had not been prevailed upon with a bribe of 100 Dollars, to exceed the mercy of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackviles</HI> Servants, and to open a window for light and ayre. And at the same time they forced away from the Consul there the Imperiall Capitulations, which were the only security of the English against Death or Slavery by the Turkes. And within a few daies they hurried their Prisoners with Turkish guards 350 miles overland to Constantinople, to imprison them in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crowes</HI> owne House: Many of their fellow Factors being soone after brought in like manner to partake of the same bondage. And what he acted by his cruel Agents at Smirna, He him∣selfe undertooke to execute upon the Factory at Con∣stantinople; where taking the opportunity of a Gene∣rall Court or meeting of the Nation; He caused the Gates to be shut, and by surprise tooke them all his Prisoners; and set strong guards upon them, to prevent all accesse to them, and their sending the least paper abroad; some of them also being clapt in Chaines.</P>
<P N="4">4. He caused the Counting houses, Warehouses and Chambers of the English at Constantinople, to be sei∣zed and sealed up. And his servants Hetherington and Zuma did the same to the whole English Nation at Smirna; and proceeded also to breake open and ran∣sake all their Chambers, Trunkes and Counting houses; and to plunder and carry away unto Turkish Canes, all money, goods, faculties and effects whatsoever they could find, either at home or abroad: Exposing their
<PB REF="8"/> Servants and Families to the mercy of the Infidells for their subsistence.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 83.</NOTE>5. He breathed forth most severe threats and me∣naces by his Agents, against the Servants and families of the Factors, to extort from them discovery and con∣fession of their Masters Estates and debts, and for deli∣very of their Bookes; intending to devoure the whole: and the dread of the Turkish Souldiers and Officers (whose tiranny was so higly menaced) so affrighted the Factors Servants, that they fled to ships for refuge; leaving the plundered Houses to the open world.</P>
<P>Thus the Reader will find S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crowes</HI> Cruelty and vigor in Executing, to be no less, then his subtilty and policy in Contriving his designe of rapine upon the Companies Estates: and if the outcries and clamors of the Jewes and Turkes against such horrid oppres∣sions and destructive courses to all future Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 82. 93.</NOTE> to∣gether with some Presents made to the Vizier by some few of the factors that fortunately escaped imprison∣ment, had not caused the Turkish justice to interpose, and redeeme the Merchants Estates, and the Factors persons from his cruell and covetous hands, his designe had certainly been fully successefull.</P>
<P>Now let the Reader judge whether the Company were not obliged for their owne preservation, upon ad∣vice of these horrid attempts of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> to seeke some present redress. And this they did by hum∣ble addresses to the late Parliament, who were pleased to order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">P. 95.</NOTE> his Revocation; and by ordinance of Par∣liament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">P. 97.</NOTE> to authorise S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Bendishe</HI> to be Em∣bassador in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crowes</HI> stead. Yet when S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Tho∣mas Bendishe</HI> arrived) S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> contemnes the autho∣rity whereby he was sent; and pretends him to be no other then an Impostor, who had counterfeited Com∣missions
<PB REF="8"/> for an Embassy; although his authority (being both from the King and the Parliament) was as great as ever any Embassador carried into Turky: and he secretly insinuated to the Vizier, that the English Nation there were most of them Rebells; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Bendyshe</HI> intended to be their Head: Suggest∣ing also that he had Letters from the King to the Grand Signor for his owne continuance in the Embassy; hoping to have hindered the reception of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Bendyshe.</HI> But when the falsehood of his pretences ap∣peared to the Vizier, He caused his owne officers to send him on board a Turkish Vessell to Smirna, to be from thence shipped for England, to be dealt with ac∣cording to his demerits. And upon his arrivall here in <HI>April</HI> 1648,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 99.</NOTE> the Parliament committed him Pri∣soner to the Tower of London in order to his Tryall; and referred the Companies Complaints to be exami∣ned by the Committie for the Navy: and severall witnesses in the case were by them examined; although the Report was not made, through the cunning arti∣fices of S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> to delay the full hearing of the Cause. But it is humbly submitted to every ingenuous Reader, whether there was not cause sufficient to send home S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow:</HI> and whether S <HI>Thomas Bendishe</HI> was not obliged in faithfulnsse to his trust, to proceed as he did, in order to the performing his owne Embas∣sy: And whether the hand of Justice might not have fallen heavy upon S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> if there had been that vigorous prosecution which the blacknesse of his designes against the Company might have provoked them unto. Yet if S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sackvile</HI> had not by private in∣formations, and by pamplets (in a very secret and un∣ingenuous way dispersed) lately endeavoured to blast the Companies and the Embassadors reputation; and
<PB REF="9"/> also to have insinuated most false complaints of great injuries done to him by the Company; and if he had not commenced vexatious Suites at Law against them, upon hopes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvantage by the patience and forbea∣rance they have shewed towards him: These his crimes had not been made thus publique; being done without thought of Malice or prejudice to his person; and not without greife and shame That one who enjoyed so faire an Income from the Company, and underwent but an easy Expence, and therefore could not but be master of a very ample Estate; should thus <HI>betray</HI> them who <HI>intrusted</HI> and <HI>maintained</HI> him; and so wilfully purchase ruine to himselfe, with the expence of his owne fortunes, and <HI>above one hundred thousand Pounds</HI> loss to the Company.</P>

<P>WHereas the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, somtime before our com∣ming to this place, by a Court of their Assistants, there∣unto specially authorized, treated with us touching a yeerly allowance for our care and paines during our residence here as his Majesties Ambassador; to bee had and taken in such particu∣lars
<PB N="5" REF="11"/> as might have relation to their trade and occasions: And for a conclusion of such treaty as aforesaid, did offer unto us the election of any one of their agreements, formerly made with a∣ny of our Predecessors in like occasion. And for a further mani∣festation of their sincerity in their said offer, upon our accord thereunto, did at the Court aforesaid, in publick give into our Hands and possession the Copies of five of their agreements, made with our said Predecessors, with power to Choose which of them wee should best like of, to bee a rule and pattern for an absolute conclusion and condition to bee drawn up between us and them; thereon also promising that they would make, grant, and confirm the like unto us. And whereas wee thereon, and to the purposes and ends afore mentioned, chose and fixed upon that agreement, which the said Company had made with Sir <HI>Thomas Glover,</HI> formerly Ambassador, Resident for the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> with this state: and his Majestie by his favour did assure the same unto us, gratiously promising to make his em∣ployment of us here, as good and beneficial in all the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowances and perquisites thereof, as it had been to any of our Predeces∣sors whoever, and wee expected no less. The said Company, finding themselvs mistaken in their offer (as they pretended) first retired from the same, denying their said agreement (though sufficiently prooved before his Majestie) and then by force of presents and mony given under hand to the Officers of that time, so prevailed against us, that wee could not onely not ob∣tain that Right, which since hath appeared unto us, and (as well by their own agreement, as by his Majesties judgment then, Custome, and their former contracts) was due unto us; but were forced after to other agreements with the said Company, by which (over and above all such Rights, Privileges, and Per∣quisits, as then were and should bee granted unto us by his Ma∣jesties Capitulations, and besides all other gratifications and al∣lowances accustomed to bee given to his Majesties Ambassador, (which in houshold provisions, only the said Company, assured us were to the vallue of 800 l. <HI>per annum,</HI> sterling, at least) and over and above such Plate, and Houshold Stuff as they assured us, wee should finde of theirs here, and hold to our use during our residence, (of which wee found not the vallue of and Asper)
<PB N="6" REF="12"/> the said Company did covenant with us, (for and in respect of our paines and care only therein agreed to bee taken by us, in their affaires and occasions as aforesaid, for and during all our time as his Majesties Ambassador with this State,) they would pay or caus to bee paid unto us the sum of five thousand<NOTE PLACE="marg">viij. <HI>Sterling.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Chic∣keenes, per an.,</HI> to be paid by equal proportions quarterly before∣hand; by their failing wherein (besides our other engagements for them to a very good vallue) twenty and five thousand Dollars or there abouts rests at this day due and unpaid unto us: And whereas also after the agreements aforesaid, upon several argu∣ments held before his Majestie, concerning the rights of that Consulage which amongst other things is granted by the Grand Signor, and payable by his Capitulations to his Majesties Am∣bassador Resident at this imperial Port from strangers, (to which the said Company could shew no likely or probable title) The said Company were adjudged to relinquish their pretences to the said Consulage; and a grant thereof under his Majesties Royal Hand and signet, was thereon made and given to us, for our better support during the time of our residence here. The said Company (upon conditions between them and us agreed) did also promise to give us content therefore; with intent ne∣vertheless thereby to get advantage of our credulity and ab∣sence, and to draw us out of suspect of their evil intentions to∣wards us, which hath since, (as well by their several interrupti∣ons and hinderances here in the Collection thereof, as their practises, and endeavours at Council Table before his Majestie, and by their other appeals to the Courts of Parlament, where in these times of distractions, they presumed of som better ad∣vantage) hath appeared unto us; Whereby, and by suggesting several untruths against us, and by other false wayes they have endeavoured not only to deprive us of the strangers Consulage, and benefit thereof; but under that colour also and these their pretences, to keep themselvs from paying, as us from taking such other Consulage, as was, and is as much our right, and due unto us from themselvs, by the said Capitulations and the Grand Signor's grant thereon, for all their own goods Traded in; And now of late, but suspecting our just intentions of ma∣king a claim thereto, (for untill this present day wee never made
<PB N="7" REF="12"/> any demand therefore, or publick pretence therein) to prevent what they suppose wee might justiy do in our own right, (for wee take God to Witness wee know no other caus) under like unjust and scandalous pretences, wee are certified that they not only go about to get us remooved from our employment here, but <HI>upon fals suggestions,</HI> loos and bare suspitions onely, <HI>have gotten Order</HI> for the seizure of all our Lands and other Estates in <HI>En∣gland</HI> into their power; as som of their own Servants and Fa∣ctors here have the confidence to report and affirm; and as <HI>wee are assured</HI> from thence, without hearing of us; nay, so much as intimation to us of the grounds thereof, or such matters and things as they pretend at least to have against us, whereby wee might answer for our selvs; and so, whil'st wee are labouring (as for these many years wee have don, with all fidelity for them and their publique Interest, (whereof, as wee have proof sufficient in our actions, so wee have him that is Judg of the World for witness to our Conscience) they are <HI>contriving the ruine of us and our Posterity;</HI> which manner of proceeding so <HI>unjust, horrid,</HI> and <HI>odious</HI> before God and Man (as in all reason wee ought) taking to heart and our serious consideration, and as well that violence which is offered to the Lawes, and his Ma∣jesties Honor and Interest therein, as our self and our family) not pretending to extend that authority which his Majestie hath put into our hands to unlawful ends, but only to make a just use of it for the right &amp; lawful defens of our selvs &amp; it in the several occasions aforementioned; finding by acompt under the hands of the Treasurer of the said Company here, that for such goods as they have brought in and carried out from the Port of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there is due unto us according to the Capitu∣lations, and the Grand Signors grants therein, to the value of Dollars Ryals of 2/8, seventy four thousand; and that for the like in <HI>Smyrna</HI> there is due Dollars Ryals of 8/8, one hundred thousand <HI>in circa;</HI> and rating that Estate in Land which they have gotten into their power as aforesaid, but at the value wee were offered for it, <HI>viz.</HI> at ninety seven thousand and five hundred Dollars; in all, two hundred seaventy one thousand and five hundred Dollars.

<HEAD>Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> his Instructions to <HI>John Hethrington,</HI> dated in <HI>Pera</HI> the <HI>30<SUP>th</SUP></HI> of <HI>April 1646.</HI> For the execution of the aforesaid Warrants, with a Schedule of the nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of such men whose Goods hee chiefly aimed at, by a mark in the Margin.</HEAD>
<P>BY those Instructions wee have given to <HI>Lorenzo</HI> our Druggerman, in which wee send you as Assistant, and Superintendent, you will finde that wee have given him Or∣der (under color of the Leviation in hand, taking advan∣tage of their former refusal) to require either the money, and each mans part thereof respectively to bee paid into his hands there <HI>in specie,</HI> (which I conceive they are not able, or at least with their conveniency cannot, and so will not do,) or give him Caution by some good pawn (as in those Instru∣ctions) to a greater value; <HI>viz.</HI> one third part mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at least, for the payment of the money here, which you are to endea∣vour to see observed, or cause that course to bee taken there∣in, which is directed by Us in Our said Instructions to <HI>Loren∣zo; viz.</HI> upon their refusal, by means of the <HI>Chiouz</HI> and <HI>Cad∣die,</HI> to apprehend the chief and most refractory, and seal up the Ware-houses of them that have most Estate and Goods, and those chiefly aimed at, whose names you shall finde mark∣ed in a list of Names, and Schedule hereunto annexed, with a mark agreeable to that in the margin.</P>
<P N="2">2. You are to be carefull that no creature know any part of your design; and sure not to be Courted by good fellowship, or other shew of friendship to you, or us, by discourse tou∣ching the ends of your coming or otherwise to make the least discovery, that may give intimation, or light of your inten∣tions. To any demanding of you the reason of your coming down; you shall say (as true it is) that you are sent to bee a spectator, witness, and overseer, of the Druggerman and

<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="16" REF="18"/> <HI>Chiouz</HI> proceeding in the Leviation, which they came about, and which so much concerns mee, them, and the publick in∣terest, and that that bee not bawked, or delaid, and that I might bee sure, to have the better intelligence from time to time of theirs, and the Nations procedings and accordingly (this beeing the first part of your service) you are to carrie your self; and as you are to perswade the Consull and Na∣tion on the one side, with reasons civil, and fair terms; so on the other you are ro urge the Druggerman, and <HI>Chiouz</HI> to provoke (or procure the <HI>Caddie,</HI> as occasion of resistance shall bee offered) to do their offices.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whil'st you are laboring in this fair way, to these ends, and before you discover either too much passion, or eager∣ness, in pursuit thereof, or ought of your farther purposes, you must by all possible means and wayes seek to discover, what Goods and estate, each of the Nation (especially those before mentioned) have in their houses, and Magazeens, or carried abroad. <HI>viz.</HI> and principally Drugs, Cotten, and Gro∣graine yarnes, and more especially Silke, and Cloth: for the better knowledg whereof, you are to send som <HI>Armenian,</HI> or <HI>Jew</HI> Broker about, under colour and pretence of buying or bartering, for som Cloath, who by that advantage m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y enter their Ware-houses, and take notice what cloth or other Commodities they have, and where; and thereby give you light how to begin, and to proceed in your work to purpose.</P>
<P>But (as before directed) you are not to stir in the Second Warrant, untill the first have taken place, and you see the issue of that for the Leviation, on which if they pay you money there into the hands of <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> (which as before will bee impossible for them) your work will bee so much the easier, that money will serve mee as well: if they cannot pay, but offer your Bils without caution by pawn, you are not to take that, nor to accept any personall security, no not all the Nation for one of them, but in such case to proceed to a sei∣zure, and then bee sure you seiz enough, and all you can fasten on, especially of those men under the marks before mentio∣ned. But if they com to give Bills for the Money, which is
<PB N="17" REF="18"/> the thing you must chiefly press for, and will bee most like∣ly to be obtained; then those Goods so pledged and deposited (and for that purpose resting in your possession untill their Bills bee paid) will bee a sit subject for your other Warranr to work on, and (if there should after bee occasion of additi∣on) the rest would the more easily be found out and brought under; for which end, upon such seizure or pawn as before directed, you are to send us advice by express of the nature, condition, and quantity of such things as shall bee either ren∣dred you for a pawn, or seized by you, and what remaines of that parties besides, which if it bee in Cloth (and no o∣ther offer to bee had) you may take that at 45 Doll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs <HI>per</HI> Cloth, and so all other Commodities at a like under value, and after that rate ⅓ more then the value of each man's part in the Leviation (as in <HI>Lorenzoe's</HI> instructions) towards expen∣ces down for charges, suits of Law, casualties in sale, &amp;c. that may ensue.</P>
<P N="5">5. In case none of the two propositions take place with the Nation touching the Leviation, <HI>viz.</HI> either for payment of money there, or by Bills of Exchange, with security by pawn (wherein you are to know that <HI>the Law is</HI> on your side, and giv's you liberty to take what security lik's you, or refuse what like's you not) and that you bee thereby driven by way of force to make a seizure (which I doubt you will bee) In such case by means of the * <HI>Chiouz</HI> and * <HI>Caddie</HI> (as in <HI>Lorenzoe's</HI> in∣struction) you must first seize the persons most refractory, or most usefull to your occasion, into the <HI>Chiouz's</HI> hands; and keep them safe from communication with any other of the Nation; then seal up their, and every of their Ware-houses refusing; and after break them, and every of them open, and thence at your leisures, take out and carry, into som Cane or Canes first prepared by you, so much Silk, Cloth, Grograin, or Cotten-yarn, Druggs, Wax, and other like Merchantable Goods as you shall finde, and may amount to the value of his part of the Leviation so refusing; with ⅓ part more, as before; and the same shall keep so arrested and seque∣stred untill farther Order from us in that behalf; into what
<PB N="18" REF="19"/> Ware-house soever you enter, taking-precise notice and ac∣compt, as well what Goods you leav behind you, as what you take away, of which you are to give us punctual advice by express, for our better Government in what wee may bee occasioned farther to order and direct you, in execution of your second Warrant, after wee shall see the issue of the first.</P>
<P N="6">6. For your better means to effect these ends, you must bee carefull, and as much as in you lyeth, and before you begin ought, by Friends, Presents, Money, or els, first to make the <HI>Caddie</HI> sure to you, and so his x <HI>Neipe,</HI> and those in credit with them, whether of his houshold▪ or in the Town; and especially amongst those of the Town, <HI>Bustangees</HI> and <HI>Aga;</HI> and having them with you, and beeing backed with those Commands and that <HI>Fettfaro,</HI> which you have in your hand; you need not doubt of prevailing over the other or any op∣posing you, the chief and principal beeing settled, whom you may confirm yours, by telling them that the Trade, and so their good is concerned, advantaged and protected by the Ambassador, and his care thereof, whose proper work that is, and that power given him by the Capitulations, and the Grand Signors express commands now sent with <HI>Fettfaro</HI> thereon; declaring that all our Subjects should obey our Orders accordingly, without which it would bee impossible to have any Trade continued here or there, or they have any Commerce or benefit thereby, there beeing none almost now but English that Trade, and that must also fail if their publick Debts bee not paid.</P>
<P N="7">7. For this purpose, you are to spare no charge, whatever it cost; wee resolving to make the Estate of such as resist, to pay the expence, as well as our demands; and therefore you are well and diligently to observ the proceeding of the <HI>Cad∣die,</HI> and working of the Nation with him, or the Town; and accordingly, and with a diligence proportionable, ply your business.</P>
<P N="8">8. For the better effecting whereof, considering your self and the Druggermen as strangers to the forms of that place, and
<PB N="19" REF="19"/> that those of the Nation may bee false to you; and to the end you may not bee to seek, as well for means to com ac∣quainted with the <HI>Caddie</HI> and other chief men of the place in occasion, nor how to discover our Merchants Estates and proceedings, nor to have a constant intelligence on them, or want help in occasion; you shall make use of such Letters as you will have from the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, and our self, to the <HI>French</HI> Consul there, praying the Astance of his Drug∣germen in your occasions; under which gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als, having Or∣der from the Consul for his Druggermen in such occasion, beeing a <HI>Jew,</HI> you may for money (which you are not to spare) make him yours, and work him to your ends; but bee carefull (however) you trust him not with any secret, or discover the least particular and private part of our instructi∣ons; onely, that you are sent by my order, and the consent of the Nation here, for a Leviation towards som publick Debts and occasions belonging to the whole Nation; and doubting that som of them for avoiding payment, might go about either to conceal their Estates, or make opposition; as one Ambassador ought to do to another (in like case) I have desired the assistance of their Druggerman, doubting the fidelity of our own in a case wherein they are more de∣pendant on their own Merchants; by this means you will not onely enable your self by an experienced help, but take him off from joyning with and serving our Factors, and op∣posing or hindering you with the <HI>Caddie,</HI> &amp;c. and beyond this, hee is not like to bee of great use to you; except happi∣ly (finding him like to proov faithful, and to promise fideli∣ty) you can by Money make use of him for discovery of the Merchants Estates as before, or making the Townsmen ca∣pable of the grounds and reasons of this payment, and our present Order therefore; if so, you will not onely leav the Factors without a party, or other defence, against our Au∣thority, and the Grand Signors Commands (which I must expect they will endeavour by all means possible to them, in in the waies of resistance, faction, or bribing to avoid) but help to bring in their Estates also discovered; in both you
<PB N="20" REF="20"/> will have this advantage, that what ever you give, come's out of their main stock; and so you may spare the less.</P>
<P N="9">9. I hope the Customer before your arrival will bee a little calmer, then hitherunto hee hath been, and at last forsake the Merchants part; if not, you shall do well on your first arri∣vall, as on your old score of friendship, under colour of a visit, to make him sensible, not onely of those curtesies I have formerly don him, but to let him know how sensible I am of such his proceedings, and how contrary they are to his pro∣mises and oaths to mee, in case I could get him to bee made Customer of that place; at last, and in extremity, that if hee persist, you have power sufficient to curb him, or send him to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and see first before you com to action, how that language will work with him.</P>
<P N="10">10. If this take no effect to make him yours, (which I wish, if possible) you may tell him, hee can but expect a Custom for those Goods, which are ready to bee transported; and that whether those Goods go by these Ships or Land, hee shall have that, and a present to boot; conditionally hee suffer no Goods to pass by day or night, but such as hee shall have your or my allowance and note for, under your hand; where∣in if hee will assist you, that is, to deteign such Goods as I shall have occasion to attach and arrest; for all such as you arrest, you have power upon his performance of his part, to give him Bills for, payable by mee to the import of whatever they shall amount unto in Custom, together with such present to him therefore, as you and hee can agree for.</P>
<P N="11">11. In case this will not serv his turn, you are then to proceed by the <HI>Caddie,</HI> to mak <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze</HI> to the Port, of his demeanure; lea∣ving the prosecution of him, and his demeanure hereto us, in that way shall bee fitting his carriage, and our duty there∣in; towards the procuring of which <HI>Arze</HI> in occasion, and to make it such as may take hold on the said <HI>Bogus,</HI> or any of his Abbettors or Assistants, Friends, Servants or other Mer∣chants, his Majesties Subjects, or of the Subjects of the Grand Signor, or any strangers whoever, that shall bee ayding or
<PB N="21" REF="20"/> assisting of any of his Majesties Subjects, <HI>in contra</HI> to our law∣full Orders aforementioned, (grounded on his Majesties Au∣thority, the imperial Capitulations, and Grand Signors Commands agreeable thereunto) you are to spare no cost: but whatever you do that way, must bee private, and to bee sure with charge.</P>
<P N="12">12. Thus having latitude without limit to procure our just ends in manner before prescribed, as you are carefully to intend the matter committed to your trust; so you are dis∣creetly and with moderation to attend for sit time, and ob∣serv our directions in the series and succedency for manner of your proceedings; not absolutely limiting you, however therein, but (not having opportunity, first timely to advise us at this distance, and as otherwise might bee necessary in such case) observing and taking a fair and probable way to the main end you go for; wee leav you at liberty to do what shall appear most requisite; nevertheless willing you to ad∣vise us of all such digressions, and alterations in your pro∣ceedings, with the causes thereof, by expresses from time to time, and on all occasions; that thereon wee may govern our selves, and direct you as may bee most requisite for effe∣cting of that you go about, with Honour to his Majesty and safety to our selves.</P>
<P N="13">13. That Letter you carry with you to Mr <HI>Lancelot,</HI> will shew you and him the caus why I desire not to make use of his hand in this particular; it agreeing best with his own desire to bee spared in it; however if hee stand not inclined to the Leviation, and to farther it, at least comply therein for him∣self and his proportion, and stand neuter for the rest; the first man you are to begin withall must bee hee, whose person though as beeing Consul wee will not have you attach untill our further order (except in case of resistance) yet you shall enter into his Hous and Warehouses, as being a Marchant withall, and there seize, sequester, and take away, as in any other man's case, in the manner, and to the ends afore spe∣cified.</P>
<P N="14">14. But if you perceiv that the Nation have conveyed away a∣ny
<PB N="22" REF="21"/> considerable part of their Estates, that they stand resolute in denyall of the Leviation, or refuse to give caution there∣fore as directed, or doubt any sort of combination amongst them to those ends; and finde that Mr <HI>Lancelott,</HI> hath either connived with them or any of them in sending any Goods a∣board any of the Ships in Port, since our order of the 26 of <HI>January</HI> past, or to have sent any of his own Estate or others; you shall forthwith in such case, make use of the warrant to that effect, now also delivered into your hands, and for that especial purpose; and thereon caus the <HI>Chious</HI> to seiz, take into his power and safe custody, the bodies and persons of the said <HI>John Lancelott</HI> Consull, and six or eight more of the chief of the Nation, that you shall finde to have any hand therein, or shall refuse the Leviathan, <HI>viz. Daniel Edwards, Sam. Barnardiston, James Moyer, Henry Davis,</HI> or <HI>John Ball, John Pixley,</HI> &amp;c. and seal up their Houses, Warehouses, and Magazines, till farther Order from us: But if you shall have any just caus given you to suspect the conveying of any goods out of their Houses, Warehouses, after such entry, sei∣zure, and you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng up of their Houses, &amp;c. before such advice can come unto us, and wee return you answer, and give farther directions therein; in such case, and as be∣fore directed, in the cases aforementioned, you shall enter the Warehouses of the said parties, take accompt of Goods and Estate there; and then by inventory take into your posses∣sion, and carry away the same, and every part thereof, espe∣cially fine goods, to some other safe place provided by you beforehand to such purpose; and there keep and detain the same until our farther order; and the other grosse Goods keep sealed up till then.</P>
<P N="15">15. In case you should find <HI>Porter</HI> the master of the <HI>William</HI> &amp; <HI>Thomas,</HI> not gone from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> nor apprehended by the <HI>Chi∣ouz</HI> sent down before your arrivall for that end; you must use all possible means to get him into your power, and the hands of the <HI>Chiouz</HI> now going with you, and send him a∣long with the rest; of the insolency of whose proceeding there (I mean of that escape there made by him first, and then
<PB N="23" REF="21"/> of the assault after by his Mariners) you must use all possible diligence to discover the truth with its circumstances, and which of the Nation were his Counsellors, Abettors or Assi∣stants therein; and thereof, and the particulars give us advice; as also, and especially, who have laded any Goods on his Ship, and to what value; whereof you are to demand ac∣compt for Mr <HI>Brent,</HI> and Mr <HI>Lancelot,</HI> and if they two bee found guilty, especially the Consull, bee sure to bring him up for one.</P>
<P N="16">16. In the mean time you are to give strict charge by the <HI>Caddie</HI> to the Masters of the Ships, that none of them lade any goods on their, or either of their Ships, without fur∣ther Order; and sending the Consull, or other of the Mer∣chants, by some of the <HI>Chiouzes</HI> servants; and with the o∣ther <HI>Chiouz</HI> you are to stay with <HI>Lorenzo</HI> there, to make good the Estate, untill further Order from us upon advise.</P>
<P N="17">17. In Case when you shall have entred any of the Merchants houses, and there seized of any of their Goods, or Estates, as Cloth especially, any Jew, or other shall com and pretend that that Estate is his, and bought of that Marchant; in such case after the proof of the particulars of his bargain before the Law, hee is to proov also, that hee hath paid the money for it; or els not having paid, when hee payes to receiv his goods, and untill then, the Estate to remain with you, or untill other Order by Justices which will require him to pay the money, or free the Goods.</P>
<P N="18">18. For what concerns the strangers Consulage, after a day or two beeing there, you are to tell Mr. <HI>Lancelot,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brent,</HI> that according to their promise, I have long expected the ac∣compt of particulars from them, and the Tariffe by which they use to rate goods in Consulage; which you are to de∣mand at first, and to expect, with some shew of civility for a while.</P>

<HEAD>¶ Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI>'s Warrant to prohibite English ships to lade or depart.</HEAD>
<P>VVHereas wee have heretofore in the name of the Grand Signor been required by the Vizier, to will and command that none of the ships of his Majesties sub∣jects whatever, coming into the Ports of <HI>Constantinople</HI> or <HI>Smyr∣na,</HI> should depart; or any ship coming into the Port of <HI>Smyr∣na</HI> should lade or take aboard them any Goods or Merchan∣dize, or bee dispeeded thence, until licence from the Port, and our order thereon and in that behalf: And whereas the said pleasure of the Grand Signor, aswell by his own Imperial Commands, as by the Capt. <HI>Bassa</HI>'s letters, and our Orders thereon, have been signified to the Consul and Nation at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and to the several Masters of ships there; And that yet som of them still continue lading, and notwithanding have since such Order and Command, dispeeded som ships from that Port, to the hazard of the lives and fortunes not only of them that have so laden &amp; been aiding to the dispeed∣ing of such ships, but thereby given scandal to the sincerity of his Majesties friendship, and such jealousies thereon, as (in these times of Warr and Difficulties) may endanger a rupture between the Kingdoms, divers of the ships of his Ma∣jesties subjects at present being joyned with the Venetian Fleet; and actually in consort with them, lying and attend∣ing at the mouth of the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> ready to give the Grand Signor's Fleet battel at their own doors, and issue out of ther Ports. You are hereby required once more strictly to inhi∣bite, and in his Majestie's name to charge and command all &amp; every of his Majestie's subjects, Masters of ships riding in the Port of <HI>Smyrna</HI> whoever, to forbear taking on board their or either of their ships or vessels, any Goods or Merchandize for the account of English or other whoever; and that they depart not the said port, untill wee shall bee able to procure
<PB N="27" REF="25"/> and signifie other and further order in this behalf; as also to signifie unto and require all and every of his Majestie's sub∣jects residing in <HI>Smyrna</HI> as Factors or others, that untill such licence and signification as aforesaid, they and every of them forbear to lade or cause to bee laden on any such ship or Ves∣sel that now is or may hereafter come into the said Port within the time aforesaid, by themselvs or any other direct∣ly or indirectly, any Goods, Merchandize and other Estate whatever; as they and every of them doing the contrary will answer it, and the dammages that may ensue at his and their utmost perils; and if any of them, Masters of ships or Factors, or other his Majestie's subjects whoever, after publication or notification hereof before witness, shall refuse to obey and do contrary to this Our Order, or any part thereof, you shall proclaim him and them and every of them (so disobeying and doing) Rebels, and out of his Majesties protection; and thereon signifie his or their and every of their names to Us; to the end wee may proceed against them and every such ac∣cordingly.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Jo. Hetherington!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have this day received Letters from <HI>Smyrna</HI> of the 22. and 25. of <HI>April,</HI> finde thereby that <HI>Porter</HI> was not then de∣parted;
<PB N="28" REF="26"/> that the <HI>Chouz</HI> with the Druggerman were arrived; that all they or M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lancelot</HI> had done, was by a Letter rather to send him away than summon him, for ought I can discern to the contrary: wherein hee had intimated to him the Grand Signor's pleasure and my Order for his stay. In fine a piece of the old story, others not beeing to bee expected from one so deeply interested in the others lading. In conclusion, I finde <HI>Jorden</HI> come into that Port also unladed, and to have contra∣cted for his lading there, without regard to his promise or my ingagement for his lading here; and that also by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lancelott</HI>'s perswasions, contrary to the others own resoluti∣on, (as his Letter relate's) the meaning whereof can bee no other, than that hee and the Nation have been work∣ing, whil'st hee hath endeavoured to make mee believe other∣wise; <HI>viz.</HI> the carrying of all out of the Countrey, and de∣feating the Leviation, &amp;c. for that's the very language of the Nations meaning, whil'st they desire 4 moneths time yet for payment, (as those that have advice of that resolution pretend and say); but I have not yet received their general Letter, though divers Copies thereof are come to Town, which is a Riddle also.</P>
<P>Upon the premisses I shall not finde cause to alter any part of your Instructions, but second it in all as well form as mat∣ter; <HI>viz.</HI> First to proceed with that business of <HI>Porter</HI> and his Laders, to clap them up and make them and their Estates sure, as directed; then to proceed to the Leviation; and af∣ter to let the other fall in of cours, and take it's place in time. Only one Caution I shall think good to add, that in case there bee not or you cannot get a resolution for the Levia∣tion by a general consent in Court, with a Pawn for pay∣ment, in such manner as is directed; you need not trouble your self with that, but according to that List and Schedule annexed to the Order for Leviation, proceed to a sequestra∣tion and possession of every mans particular apart, not regar∣ding the Consent of the whole, by staying or looking to an Act of Court of their assent there; for you must know that this is an Order for execution, and an Act of Justice, procee∣ding
<PB N="29" REF="26"/> from mee as his Majestie's Commissioner, and you are to govern your self accordingly, and as men sent on such an Errand; and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to treat or capitulate beyond your I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>structi∣ons, and so you are to let those people know in occasion.</P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edwards</HI> hath given order for his part of the Leviation money by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Piggot;</HI> who even now make's tender of it to mee, and happily will think much to bee arrested for that: But I take no notice of any such tender to mee in person; the first Order run's for payment into <HI>Cancellaria</HI> by such a day; your Order goe's for Leviation and Charges for non-payment there; and (believe mee) the Charges of their refu∣sal at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> must bee born by them of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and not by mee or the Nation here. But leaving that dispute aside, (as a thing by the by) in case M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edwards</HI> should object this as a reason of his, for avoiding his part of the Charge, or for gi∣ving Caution; you may say that untill it bee certified to you, you can take no notice of it, neither spare him nor any o∣ther, but in the mean time are to proceed with him as the o∣ther: and over and above, in case hee should (notwithstand∣ing that Order of his before mentioned) bee contented yet to give in Caution by Pawn, as others are ordered to do, hee proving faulty in Lading the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> you are to proceed with him according to your Instructions and Com∣mand to such effect; for (I confess) I long to have him in my power, of all men in <HI>Smyrna,</HI> having suffered by him more than by any one there, except one that you have advice of.</P>
<P>To conclude, taking all you have to do into considerati∣on, I finde you have a difficult part to act, and therefore you are to bee sure to take it by those degrees you are directed in, and to be sure to avoid the confounding of one thing with a∣nother, and in the last place to make your demand of Consu∣lage, &amp;c. as by your last Warrant, but not that neither untill further Order, (I mean on the whole Nation).</P>
<P>And touching that, of <HI>Lancelott</HI> and his Companion, to proceed by degrees with them also, or rather than fail h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and his Companion coming up (as I presume they will, if
<PB N="30" REF="27"/> not for the <HI>Leviathan,</HI> for having laded on the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> contrary to order) you may let that pass till their ar∣rival here (having first sealed up their Warehouses and count∣ing houses, as directed,) by the by however getting what advice you may touching their carriage of that business. And whatever you come to discover, shall act, or do; I pray advise mee from time to time, &amp; daily, or every two dayes at the fur∣thest; for your intelligence will bee the onely rule for my future direction; not having further to add that I can think necessary at present I rest.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I Have this morning by the Consuls Messenger received the Originall of the nations generall Letter subscribing to the Leviation, desiring respite of payment for five moneths time; to which I give that answer you will finde in the Co∣py of mine to the Consul herewith sent you; by which you will discern that I still drive the business to a Caution and pledg; and with all reason I may demand it, for by that time they may have conveyed away their Estates, or received som other order from <HI>England,</HI> and so frustrate the Leviation totally, &amp; leav &amp; the Nation here under the Debt and ingage∣ment; which you may let the Nation know I have no reason to admit of, and so not to contradict that order I have for∣merly sent, which is to demand your Caution for perfor∣mance: next (suppose they would now pay the full, actually in hand to my Druggerman, you are to say, you have not power to take that neither, without like security for the Charges of their former refusal; which what it is or may bee, by their contrasts ensuing, I have not been nor shall bee able to set down in particulars, untill I see the issue. Whatever it
<PB N="31" REF="27"/> may bee, they may bee sure as I seek noe advantage in that, so I am resolved not to loos by it, and lay money out of my purs for their defaults; So if they consent on these terms, give you good caution into your hands, to bee put apart by you into some place under your power, you may consent; and having done so expect my further Order thereon: other∣wise you are to proceed without more Ceremony in the way you were first directed; And so I once more leav that business, the rather findeing that the nation here will not bee otherwise satisfied with their assurance, for ought I can dis∣cern, by those I have hitherunto spoken with; resolving to morrow to call a Court, and then I am sure to finde this opi∣nion of theirs more confirmed, (as I am sure I must) when I shall demand all mine own monies, amounting one way or other to near 30000 dollars, to bee presently paid; and to say truth, I am not resolved to exspect much longer for it. You will by the inclosed see what I write to Captain <HI>Jorden,</HI> and if I might yet expect to finde him other then a Tarpawling, I could wish hee would yet take in such goods as might offer themselves at <HI>Smirna</HI> on this occasion, and come up to <HI>Constantinople</HI> therewith; from whence I would assure him as good a fraight, as ever hee had, better then hee can expect from any hand in <HI>Turkie</HI> without mee. If you finde him not too much otherwise ingaged, or changed to be round since I saw him; you may sound him to that effect, having first in your power sufficient to lade him with for this place: If hee refuse it; or accepting, give you not a chearfull assu∣rance to comply therein, you are not to suffer him or any other to lade, until further order from the Port and mee; but protest against the customer and Merchants whoever till they shall lade on him or the other ship in Port: If on this, for the better disguise of the business, hee will bee contented with a Warrant of mine to press him to this service, you shall have that also; and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, partly by denying his Lading there, on the one side; partly by Warrant and Command on the other, hee may seem to bee constrained, and so for avoid∣ing of greater Inconveniences, to embrace the of∣fer;
<PB N="32" REF="28"/> assuring him that in case his ship bring not up those goods another shall or a Carravan: If hee shall have taken in any goods of strangers (which hee pretends to bee in a treaty for) they may likewise be put onshore again, upon &amp; under colour of command from mee to desist the voyage; and if need bee I shall send a Command from hence to that purpose also. If the Customer shall be brought to dispute the business, you may tell him other goods shall bee laden in the room, &amp; those of stran∣gers on other Ships now coming down, &amp; pay him as good a Custom or better, with a 2<SUP>d</SUP> advantage to his Patron here: wherein (if <HI>Jordan</HI> consent) you are not to be scrupulous to as∣sure the Customer, and so <HI>Jordan,</HI> som considerable advantage to themselvs apart and beyond their Ordinary way; and this still to bee carried under the Cover of Command from hence, and my order thereon; wherein (save in that to <HI>Jordan</HI>) you are already sufficiently Warranted. And for that also you shall with these have Warrant and Order, effectual to bee made use of in such occasion, as by the inclosed; <HI>viz,</HI> 1. a Warrant, a new prohibiting anv others lading: 2. A pro∣test against <HI>Jordan</HI> for not complying with mee; which never∣theless I would not have you use or drive to the extremity, untill further order, but seeming (as before that hee conti∣nues inclined to his Majesties service and not changed from his former profession, by and with his consent, as before di∣rected, to make use of them, as in publick to draw him to it, as it were by an outward seeming force; If hee dispute the loss of time, you may assure him, that it will not bee long but he shall have advice of an open Port and a freer seale here, then there; for the Gallies resolv and are Ordered to depart the Castles on Monday or Wednesday next, and then the issue of that business will bee quickly seen: the time hee shall spend in Demurrage between this and that, or her, shall likewise bee considered: which offers you must know, are ra∣ther out of som hope that <HI>Jordan</HI> may bee yet a little hone∣ster then his fellowes, (that is more likely to bee firm to mee in my design) otherwise finding him or having caus to su∣spect the contrary, you may let him go as hee is, that is to
<PB N="33" REF="28"/> say not trouble your self with looking after him or his E∣state much; onely hinder him and all others from lading un∣till I am Master of that I aime at; for upon your advice I shall make use of som one of these Ships here to transport my Wife and Family, and provide for the rest in time. God bless your proceedings, and my just endeavours to a lawfull defence. Whil'st I rest</P>

<P>The manner of your proceedings with these Warrants must bee thus: First you must publish that for prohibi∣biting lading or receiving goods on board, as well to the e∣very of the Nations Houses, as to the Ships in Port, and not refuse any of them Copie; giving it into the <HI>Cancellary</HI> to bee registred, but taking back the Warrant to your self: af∣ter this you will have a fitter time to treat with <HI>Jordan,</HI> and an occasion to make use of the other Warrant for protesting against him.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="29"/> turn, having so large a Commission as your Lordship was pleased to afford mee, hee should not have been discon∣tented, though it had been to the whole of what I had brought down; which rather to let the world see how much you are abused by those that provide you these men, or to let a busi∣ness of so high a nature as this fall to the ground. But my Lord, I wish better to them, then to accuse or to blame any, onely my own hard fortune, that at my entrance into a busi∣ness of trust, I should proov so unhappy, and bee so much abused; For as I yesterday advised your Lordship by this ungratefull fellow, the Consul with six more of the chief, were rendred at Justice before the <HI>Caddie</HI> into the <HI>Balouke's</HI> hands; who prrsently brought them home, and according to your Lordships order, wee desired him to keep them close, and not to suffer any to com to have any discours with them, for prevention of som such design as was acted on <HI>Porter;</HI> and accordingly hee did, and nayled up the Windowes to the Chamber, and promised me to carry them away as last night himself, for stay hee would not; but after this, hee suffers the Consuls Druggerman to come and treat with him, and for a present of Dollars 100 caused the Windowes to bee ope∣ned, and suffered his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvant and twelv Soldiers that wee had from the Castle to guard them, to let in the Nation for a Dollar or two a head, as long as they would come. As soon as I discovered his waies of treaty with these people, I told him plainly, except hee would immediately send these people up to your Lordship, I must bee forced to send an express to your Lordship, to lament, and that your Lordship may have Justice above: but I could get no absolute answer from him; somtime hee would go, another time hee would dispute, that they proffered to pay their money, and for that end hee came; so wee were forced to let the Leviation stand a little at a stay, and to pretend those men conformable to that com∣mand in his hands, and were to bee sent up for lading of goods on the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas;</HI> and withall hath promi∣sed to give him when hee is ready t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> go, Dollars 500 more, if hee will bee carefull to see the business performed according
<PB N="35" REF="29"/> to your Lordships desire and express; and till your Lordship shall send another to assist us, wee will detain the <HI>Chiouz,</HI> sent with <HI>Jean Maria.</HI> The <HI>Balouke</HI> is now gon to the <HI>Caddie</HI> to take his <HI>Arze</HI> along with him, and at his return, I hope will either go himself, or send the <HI>Chiouz</HI> with them; but whether hee go or stay, I continue my humble request to your Honor, that with what possible speed and conveniencie your Lord∣ship may, to send us som new supply, or els to this good caus and just demands of your Lordship, in my weak opinion, your Lordship may for the present bid adieu to it.</P>

<HEAD>Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI> his full approbation of what <HI>John Hethering∣ton,</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> had done; and his further Instructions to them how to proceed. Dated in <HI>Pera</HI> the <HI>27 May, 1646.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Jack Hetherington,</HI> and so <HI>Lorenzo,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have seen and well weighed what yours of the 12<SUP>th</SUP> ad∣viseth, with that of the 13<SUP>th</SUP>, which came not to my hands before the arrival of the <HI>Balouke Bassac,</HI> with the <HI>Chiouz</HI> and their Company; who at their arrival made terrible com∣plaints of your severe proceedings with them, especially the Consul, who had prepared a learned Elogie; but I cut him off in the midst by a short approval of what you had done, and told them plainly 'twas no more than what I had enordered you, and that if you had done less, you must have seen mee no more. I told them I came not hither to bee made a slave for the Companies Debt; I had their Cove∣nant to see that paid by Leviation, and that Leviation agreed by their own, &amp;c. bade them welcom to the trouble of their own procuring, and so left them for that present to a bet∣ter consideration, in the mean time put a guard upon them.</P>
<P>This morning (they having since <HI>Saturday</HI> had the liberty of my hous, and free conference with all that would come and go) they send mee a request as full of humility, as their first discours was of vapour; with promise to pay in their parts of the Leviation; whereupon they have liberty, with a Druggerman and Janizarie to go amongst their Compani∣ons at <HI>Gallata,</HI> to gather in their monies, but to return at night: <HI>Lancelott</HI> stayes still in the hous for the greater gra∣vity.</P>
<P>Yesterday I received yours of the 15 and 16, and to bee short, approov of all you have hithero done, with the mo∣deration and discretion you have used in the passages therof, taking due notice of the vile proceedings of that ill Servant
<PB N="38" REF="31"/> of the <HI>Viziers,</HI> and his Companion the <HI>Chouz;</HI> upon whose arrival, and receipt of your former, I prayed audience with the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and Saturday last obtained it; giving him thanks notwithstanding for the service don by his <HI>Balouke B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> acquainting him that som of those men were com, that o∣thers had hid themselvs and their Estates, and so prayed as in the Command you will see direct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vizier</HI> gave mee as gracious an audience as ever I had in <HI>Turkie,</HI> and a further assurance of respects, then ever I had from any <HI>Vizier;</HI> with an assurance also of the Grand Signors esteem; which hee spake publickly, and with intent, as I con∣conceiv, to do mee Honor; which I the rather relate to you, to encounter that vanity I finde in that supposition mentio∣ned in the latter part of your last, touching what they either had, or might do towards you, that are but my instruments; wherein you may defie their utmost, as long as they them∣selvs have ought in <HI>Turkie,</HI> to purchase the contrary (if such occasion were:) but no more of this folly; wishing you also not to take farther notice of it, then to observ from what people, and what grounds this sort of language proceeded, or may hereafter bee like to bee voted, and to advise mee as you have done in this, leaving mee to provide for your safe∣ties. In the mean, for what may concern the farther eon∣duct of your business; you are to observ.</P>
<P N="1">1. (As in your instructions) that you make the Leviation the ground-work of all your future work, for the better e∣stablishment of that Factory, as formerly inordered.</P>
<P N="2">2. Next, being informed that that Factory, not onely for avoyding of the just Debts for the publick already contracted, but also for doubt of paying such expences as may bee neces∣sary for the support of the publick charge in future, have concealed much of their Estates, and intend to convey it and themselvs out of the Countrey, (as som of them of late have done) you are to use all possible diligence to discover what Estate of the Nations remaines yet in that Factory, in their own, or others possessions, the particulars, and to whom it belongs, to send mee a List in a Schedule, or (if not that)
<PB N="39" REF="31"/> as neer an estimate thereof as you can get; and in the mean time to take what care you may (agreeable to your former Commands and Warrants) that no part thereof bee trans∣ported, untill farther order from us in that behalf.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas there are two English Ships in Port, expecting their fraight there; and that wee are informed they lade a∣way Goods of the Nations in strangers names, by connivance with the Customer, and his servants there in the night; you are strictly to prohibit the Masters of the said Ships to take in any Goods, especi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly the <HI>Jonas</HI> bound for <HI>England</HI> directly, and the like Captain <HI>Jordan,</HI> who pretends to lade for <HI>Italy;</HI> and Strangers Accompts, but under that colour, to carry away the Nations Estates, before Order taken for our future subsi∣stance; intending thereby under pretences of the dangers of the times, to leav us destitute and naked of all future meanes of subsistance: For prevention of which (as well as to procure means for payment of the present Debt) you are chiefly im∣ployed, and are to apply your whole endeavours according∣ly; and (agreeable to your former Warrant and Instructions) if any of the Masters or Factors shall attempt ought <HI>in contra,</HI> untill our farther Order upon your future advice, and till wee bee better secured in the premisses, you shall declare against all such as Rebells; and apprehend all such persons whoever, and send them to us together with their accusuti∣ons, to bee proceeded against accordingly.</P>
<P N="4">4. To secure your selvs the better against those doubts you make of the Captaines resistance; suspecting any such thing, and having discovered in whose hands they have any Estates, or for whose Accompts the Captaines, or either of them have any Estates on Board; you shall caus svch of their corespondents, and interested at Land, to give good caution and security for them and it, by pledg of other Estate, (for you are not to trust to any personal security insuch case whatever without a good and considerable pawn to the value, and proportionable to the doubts &amp; occasions,) and for this and you are to look out carefully, for such Estate as <HI>Jordan,</HI> &amp; the other have on shore in any of the Factors hands by way of

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="41" REF="32"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="40" REF="33"/> Hypothecation, or otherwaies; and what Goods or Estate any of those on shore, or here, have on board the Ships there; and to make attachment and sequestration thereof, to the said ends aforesaid, untill further Order from us in this behalf and if need bee, carry them before the <HI>Caddie</HI> to caus them comply with the Command, or stand committed into your own custodies and the <HI>Chiouzes.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. What you have don to the <HI>Caddy,</HI> and his Servants, wee approv of, and desire you to continue him yours, and so all his, or any of the chief of the Town; whatever it cost you; for their better perswasion whereunto (besides what you shall give, or present on that occasion) you are to let them, and so the generality know, that the chief end of all this, is but to secure the Trade for the future; there beeing a design amongst many of them to carry, all out of the Coun∣trey, for fear (as they pretend) in these times of Warr, and to leav the Ambassador alone; And that our ends are (by kee∣ping a good Estate in the Countrey) to secure the peace, and continue the commerce; which you may boldly affirm, since my coming into the Countrey, (within these 8 years) is doubled well neer to what it was; and they see by my care it daily increaseth.</P>
<P N="6">6. If any of the Nation after payment of their parts of the Leviation, or giving you caution therefore, should desire so to bee at liberty, to lade their other goods; you may not permit that, till further Order as before declared; And this for the reasons before specified, <HI>viz.</HI> That I must bee first secu∣red, in som reasonable measure from the Nation (which is now upon consult also here) how wee may subsist for the fu∣ture; or in default of the Companies performance, and going on with their Trade, may free, or secure my Hostages; and in the mean time, how my self, Secretary, Druggermen, and Officers may, or shall bee provided for.</P>
<P N="7">7. For the better understanding hereof in publick, you may caus the <HI>Caddie,</HI> and so his people to divulge this, (as really it is) to bee (besides payment of their Debts,) the true scope, and chief meaning of this our strict care, and pro∣ceedings;
<PB N="41" REF="33"/> for better evidence whereof, you may observ to them the escape of som of our Merchants already, and the carriage of <HI>Porters</HI> ship, departed in the manner it did; and thereon you may say to them, that if I have not better obser∣vance or security from my people for the future, I shall bee ill able to answer for them to this State, or for their actions at home, or preserve the Peace, for which I am principally sent hither; for which, though the Merchants manage the Trade, 'tis I that govern and protect it, that have power to increase or diminish it.</P>
<P N="8">8 Having the Commands you shall herewith receive, you are to desire the <HI>Caddie</HI> to publish to the Ships and Nation, and so likewise to give notice to the Customer, and all Offi∣cers about the Marine, That neither the Ships presume to take on board any other Goods, nor depart the Rode with those Goods they have, nor any English Merchant or other, whether of his Majestie's, or Subjects to the Grand Signor, or others, put on board any Goods or Merchandize whatever, on any English ship or Vessel whatever in that Port, untill our farther Order, agreeable to the Commands; wherein, and for effecting whereof, or discovery of the contrary, you shall not spare any cost whatever, to the <HI>Caddie</HI> or his Ministers, the Customer or his Servants, Jews, Waiters, Boatmen, or other Officers whoever by you used, or to bee used in the premisses.</P>
<P N="9">9. What Money you shall want, you may take up either of the Customer, or other whoever (where you can finde it) and cause it to bee charged upon Mr <HI>South;</HI> for which the money is ready by mee, if it should bee for 10000. Dollars.</P>
<P N="10">10. Lastly, if the Customers should make opposition, or scruple; you (as I formerly advised and secured you) may promise him his Custom for any Goods whatever you shall bee possest of by his means or discovery, with a Present to boot, and to his content; and then I know none have to com∣plain, but my Master's own Subjects, who by the Capitulati∣ons, Fettfaw, and Commands in your hands, ought to bee under, and subject to my Judicature onely, in things de∣pending
<PB N="42" REF="34"/> between themselvs, or relating to my Govern∣ment.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Bogus,</HI> since my writing thus farr, hath been with mee twice; but hee is either such a fool, or such a knave, or both, at least so unconstant, that I finde no great likelyhood of certainty in him; so have left him to you to treat and con∣clude with him there, as you shall finde occasion, and bee fit∣test for the service; as by the Postscript in the Copy of that Letter given him for you and <HI>Lorenzo.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. I long to hear in particular what you have discover∣ed and found out; at least an estimate of the value of that you may suppose to finde there, and to whom belonging; which I desire with the first opportunity to bee advised of. <HI>Bogus</HI> pretends much that way, and I wish hee may discover what hee promises, and (whether true or no) saies, that little of that which remains in their own Warehous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s belongs to the Merchants, but to <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> &amp;c. and that all or the greatest part of their Estates is conveyed into <HI>Turks, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> hands; thinks that the best way to make a true discovery, and to get possession of the right (assoon as the Nation had given satisfaction to the Leviation) would bee to make a shew of retiring and going away, and to stay a daies journey or two out of the Town, and that thereupon they would soon bring back all their Goods to their own Houses; but at this distance I cannot so well direct you, nor otherwise, than upon receipt of those Commands I now send you, to seize what you can first, and after watch the rest as wall as you may; and so secure something to Us for a future b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring; for Wee are now on the Stage, and must through with it, or (for ought I discern of their good wills) want a beeing here another day: these people, as fast as they can, packing and conveying all away; and for the present also (with such difficulties as you see) contending the payment of their own debts; not caring to leave Us, and our Hostages, Servants, Secretarie, Druggermen, and all, destitute in this savage place; without the remorse of men, less of Christians, which they hardly appear to bee.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="43" REF="34"/>13. <HI>Bogus</HI> at his parting from mee, gave mee assurance, that (in case I would) hee could and would take from the Masters of Ships there their Sails and Rudders; but I would not as∣sent to that, without your approbation therein; who by beeing on the place, will bee better able to judg of the possibi∣lities, conveniency, or inconveniencies of such an attempt; nor would I advise it, but in case of extremity, or upon a just suspition of some design to send away the Ships, or upon proof of their Lading contrary to Order, by night or other∣waies, whereof you are to bee carefull; and in occasion (see∣ing <HI>Bogus</HI> give way to the Ships lading, or the Ships lade con∣trary and without him, (as lade yet I hear they do) and un∣der the colour of Strangers names endeavour to convey all away) you shall repair to the <HI>Caddie</HI> for counsel and help, and take license and Order from him, with some of mine and his people to watch by boats in the night, and thereby the better secure their future endeavours; for which you need not spare any reasonable cost to the <HI>Caddie</HI> or Waiters; and therein I am confident <HI>Bogus</HI> will not oppose, but farther you; if hee do not, upon the least advice I shall begin anew with him.</P>
<P N="14">14. For your better assistance yet, and to the endl may leav no way unthought of, or you unwarranted or undirected to that end you go about; I have herewith sent you Warrant to require security of the Nation (especially those to whom any of the Ships in Port shall bee consigned, or any other you shall know to have estate of the Captaines in their hands, or to have laden on the said Ships) by pawn, to the value of their lading at least; and that the Captain or Captaines of the Ships shall not depart the place therewith without my leave and order; and in case any of them refuse so to do, you shall require their appearance before the <HI>Caddie,</HI> and there demand their Persons and Estates into your hands, especially of these Merchants and Traders left behinde, <HI>viz. Davis,</HI> the other <HI>Barnardiston, Inglesby, Ball,</HI> and such other of them as you shall finde busie in lading, or to have laden any considerable Estate on the said Ships, or to have any Estate of the Masters of Ships in their hands (the said Masters not complying and be∣ing
<PB N="44" REF="35"/> obedient to my Orders in manner as directed) wherein (as I wrote Mr <HI>Jordan</HI> yesterday) hee and the rest must pardon mee, if I value my self and Hostages, at least equally with them, if not before; and the Publick before any ones parti∣cular: however in due time shall have care of him, that, and the rest also, and all as becomes mee, if they will have but pa∣tience, and bee ruled by mee, discover what Estate they have on board, and for whose Accompts, &amp;c. which doing, they shall see I will deal them that Justice in the conclusion, that they shall have cause to thank mee. But if by the perswasi∣ons of others for private ends, they steer a contrary cours: though <HI>Smyrna</HI> bee a great way off mee, they will finde by de∣grees, that I shall have means and power to reach them.</P>
<P N="15">15. Even now I am advised, that there is another English Ship arrived about <HI>Smyrna;</HI> the name I hear not of, but that by advice from within, the Ship should ride without, and re∣solves for <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> and to discharge and take in her La∣ding there; for prevention, I hope to get you a command yet before the <HI>Chiouz</HI> depart, to secure that other corner also; least that outlet should bee more troublesom than the other.</P>
<P N="16">16. Lastly, upon serious considerations, and by all I can judg of by the discourses, fears, and contrivements of this place; I conclude that your shortest and securest way to your end (upon finding the least appearance of the Masters jugling with you, or of the Ships lading or departing, and not having a true discovery of what is laden on each of them, and by whom; or finding any of the Nation underhand assisting or abetting in any way contrary to your Instructions) will bee to fall presently to work on them that move or resist you, as by your Warrant herewith sent you is directed; which agrees with the Command &amp; my Opinion, which is, that by delaies, or a seeming retreat (at least untill what is discovered be made sure, and these Ships bee made render what they have of our Nation on them) we shall get little advantage by suspending; however leav all to your nearer Judgments, according to oc∣casion on the place, for which your Warrant is large enough. And so for the present I bid you farewell, resting</P>

<P>VVHereas, wee are informed that notwithstanding se∣veral Imperiall Commands sent by the grand Seig∣nior, and declared by his Officers <HI>Chiouses</HI> and others, accom∣panied with our Orders, warrant, and directions thereon, requiring, (for severall weighty and important Causes) all and every of his Majestie's Subjects, and others whosoever to forbear lading of any Goods or Marchandise on any English Ship or vessel within the Port or Scale of <HI>Smirna,</HI> or mem∣bers thereof, and all and every such Ship or ships, vessel or vessels, to forbear taking any such goods or Marchandise on bord them for accompt of any whoever, and not to depart the said Port or members, without express Order and Licence from the Port and Us, in that behalf, (the <HI>Visier</HI> declaring us by severall wayes, as his Majesties Minister, accomptable therefore) wee are certified, how by the Combination of some of our Nation with the Customer there, two or three shipps have been already dispeeded thence full laden, and two or three ships more rest there yet lading and near laden, &amp; ready to set sail and depart; and thereby leav us to answer such their Contempt and demeanor as wee may; without the least regard to his Majesties honor or Interest by Capitu∣lations with this State, or the safety of us, or the rest of those of his Majesties Subjects, who are to remain in the Country. These are to pray and require you immediately upon receipt hereof, by all possible diligence to make enquiry after, search out, demand of the Commanders and Officers of the ships, or finde out by the Customer or other wayes, what Goods are laden on either of the English ships now in the said Port, what quantity of Goods and Merchandize, and to whom the same belongeth; at least by whom and in whose names laden: And having found out and discovered the same, to make and cause the said parties (to your selves, or in default by the

<HEAD>¶ <HI>Sir</HI> Sackvile Crow's <HI>Letter to</HI> Jo. Hetherington. 28 May, 1646.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Jo. Hetherington,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving made an end of this dispatch near two daies since. I have stayed expecting, and untill this hour do, the <HI>Chi∣ouz;</HI> whom they pretend to stay for some Services of the Grand Signors, as they did the last: but I hope this day to get him dispacht, and so come to my private Instructions to your self:</P>
<P N="1">1. Wherein (as in my Publique to <HI>Lorenzo</HI> and you, as also in your former) you are to make that of Publique shew its face outward, and to come first in Action; the first part of that pretence is now almost finished, I mean the Leviation for Past-Charges; and when that shall bee fully finished, I resolve to begin with Prouision for the Publique in future; taking into consideration the distractions of <HI>England,</HI> the War at our door here, the <HI>French</HI> forces before <HI>Ligorne:</HI> and by all these a likelyhood that wee may bee in an ill condition here, ere long: and therefore it will bee fit to look out in time, and provide some means at least, for future subsistence; wherein the Company stand obliged to the Crown of <HI>En∣gland</HI> by their Charter, and to mee by their Covenant to make Provision.</P>
<P N="2">2. When this in hand is done, that other may bee taken order for; and in the <HI>interim,</HI> under the colour of the one and the other, the full of the Estate or most of it may bee dis∣covered; and after this, I shall have opportunity to bring in my own pretences, for which you have Warrant sufficient and particular with you already; and this latter Warrant now sent you, will serve you for the other two— and for∣mer part of the business, <HI>viz.</HI> for finding out, discovery, and securing what you finde until further Order, in what hands or place soever; However, I wish it by convenient degrees and steps, at least not findeing occasion to the contrary.</P>
<P N="3">3. With the Merchants, in its time you may treat their
<PB N="48" REF="37"/> reason apart, <HI>viz.</HI> that this concerns their own preservation, as well as mine; and that they may be sure before any Estate more goes out of the Countrey, I will see at least how as well this, as that Scale may bee preserved; That a Factory, this a Residence, untill it may pleas God wee meet with better times.</P>
<P>With the Masters you may deal in another way, (if they or either of them deserv it,) <HI>viz.</HI> assure them a good and consi∣derable fraight, if they will but have patience; and so may happily also consider their demurrage, in case they behave themselves as they ought; on the other side they may bee sure, I will not overthrow so just and reasonable a resolution and design of the Publick, and of so near a relation to the preservation of all the Trade, Peace, my self and Hostages here, for the consideration of 2 or 3 ships particular accom∣modation, or their demurrage a moneth more or less; and if you finde them not capable of this good Counsel and reason, or not so consciencious of the other as to prefer it before their own Ends, you are to proceed with them accordingly; for, I have no such obligation to either of them, as may seem weighty enough to ballance the former.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now in case any of the Factory after payment of their Leviation mony or securitie therefore, should desire to bee free to lade, or to have their Estate at Liberty; you are to tell them that by fresh Order from mee, you have command to hold the Goods, and Ships as directed, &amp; upon the grounds aforemen∣tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> till provision for the future bee mad;e this Levia∣tion being alreayd eaten up and spent, before paid; and though you should have made any other pretence hitherunto, (though till further direction you had not Order at least to mention ought of my particular beyond the Leviation) you may ex∣cuse it lightly, and say you were merry with them, ctc. as they are often with mee.</P>
<P N="5">5. If any should question the reason and ground of this proceeding now, that was never in President before, you may bid them and the Company thank themselves for a great part of it; for (besides the reasons before expressed) they have
<PB N="49" REF="38"/> Ordered their Factors to convey away all their Estates, and to leav mee naked here, and the General of the Trade at Ran∣dam, and every one to shift for himself; which I beeing ad∣vised of, have reason to look out as well for theirs as my own safety. Next I have heard of som Combinations against my particular, and shall desire to provide the best I may for that too; but bee sure you discover nothing of my own pretences, untill the last, and that not untill further order.</P>
<P N="6">6. You will in your Warrant, and so in the Command, finde Order for rendring into your possession all goods a∣board the Ships, belonging to any of our Nation; wherein I would have you walk with great circumspection; First to discover from the Customer and Masters what and by whom laden, (I care not so much for whose accounts, though if you can get that, it will bee well, and a further advantage; for if it bee for any English I care not for whom; or if by any En∣glish laden, I care not by whom:) then to sequester it: and that done, take Caution of the Master beeing aboard, and party to whom it belongs, that it bee alway forth-coming upon further Order; which if either the Master or Merchants shall refuse, you are without further respect whatever by the <HI>Chouz</HI> and <HI>Caddie</HI> to take them into your possession, as in your Instructions, and by the Command directed, which is to be your refuge at all times. In case the Masters shall say that they cannot tell to whom the goods belong till Bills of la∣ding signed; they cannot however deny to tell you by what and by whom laden; at least the Customer if hee will, can discover it, and you are to press either according to occasion; and if need bee bring them before the <HI>Caddy to</HI> that end; and (in case they refuse) there endeavour to caus them unlade a new; wherein the Customer shall not loos his Custom, you agreeing with him to that end.</P>
<P>If they have not signed Bills of lading (as most likely they have not, for that is commonly the last work) discove∣ring whose goods they are, or who laded them, you are to forbid the Masters to give Bills till further Order; and if the Masters refuse or delay, to proceed against them according

In case of resistance or any Clamorous Hubub, as in <HI>Porters</HI> case, by the Mariners, you may require a guard of the <HI>Caddie,</HI> and promise payment for it to their content; or make use of the Castle to hold your prisoners in occasion; (for I shall little doubt to use <HI>Turkish</HI> help against those that oppose that authority of my Masters which I hold in <HI>Turkie</HI> by com∣mission: and I conjure you bee not scrupulous in that— what will com of it: However, look you proceed not rash∣ly nor unadvisedly in any thing, nor suffer your self to bee particularly provoked, and so spoil your Cause, but proceed alwaies according to the Command and style of the plain, Lawes, and formes of it (where my authority will not serv) <HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Caddy</HI> and power of the place, &amp; their own officers, whatever you pay for it, which in all occasion will bee your justification and mine: and they will second your procee∣dings with <HI>Arz</HI> and <HI>Maxars</HI> from time to time to the Port; which in occasion you are to seek and to back your self and mee withall: and for this end bee sure to keep the <HI>Caddy</HI> and those about him so much yours, as not to suffer the Mer∣chants, Masters of Ships or other of the Town whoever, to have any: at least to such effect as may do you prejudice or the Cause.</P>
<P N="8">8. For search and entering of houses to that end, (though that bee the substance at the Command and shadow of this dispatch, and really the substance too, in occasion) you are to proceed in that with care, respect, and moderation also having good assurance by particular marks, signs, if you can, or witness touching what you go about and pretend unto, before you force or enter any place, for books or other things.</P>
<P N="9">9. Touching those four men principally appointed to be at∣tached, you shall observ a fit time for that, that is either fin∣ding them lading or to have laden since order, or to conceale their Estate, or to have conveyed them away, and thereon
<PB N="51" REF="40"/> take them into your possession, and if need bee (doubting their disturbance or future procedings in lading &amp;c.) to send them away immediately by som of the <HI>Chouzes</HI> servants; which, I know will not onely startle all the rest below, and give them new occasion to a better submission, then to think to conquer by a contrast. However have som such occasion first, or at least pretend it if you want one; for ti's all one in this case, and I confess I had rather you send these men away, then meddle with the Masters (if you can avoid it) for all their principal Traders and Patrones beeing sent away, the Masters must then perforce obey or bee gon, as they are, laden or unladen, (which will trouble them more then all the o-other sort of force you can use to them.)</P>
<P N="10">10. You are to observ, or at least to demand in my name, and by my order, to whom this new come Ship is consigned; and from that Party or Parties demand security in the premis∣ses; or for default proceed with him and them as in the other directed.</P>
<P N="11">11. If <HI>Bogus</HI> perform not what he hath promised me (with a thousand oaths,) <HI>viz.</HI> if hee hinder not the Ships from lading, take not order, and secure you, that they depart not without your leav and my direction first had; or discover not, or en∣deavour at least by some probable waies to discover such E∣states of the Merchants as are concealed, or shall do any other trick out of Rule, or against you; without saying much to him or quarrelling the thing there, send mee word by an express immediately, and by a horsman if to bee gotten.</P>
<P N="12">12. When you send any express at any time, be sure you do it privately, for the Merchants there have way to intercept Letters; And I doubt that Messe which your last promised mee the next day following may have miscarried, for hee appears not yet, it beeing four daies since the others arrival; The first Mess was twelv daies on the way, the last but eight. But I think I may thank the good Company for the formers stay, who were not willing hee should arrive before them; send therefore a servant a dayes journey out of Town with those you send hereafter, and let none know of your sending
<PB N="52" REF="41"/> away (not the Post-master or Cape of the Messes) till your Letters are ready, and then see them sent away presently, as be∣fore, requiring him not to take a Letter from any els but your self.</P>
<P N="13">13. Though I hope there will bee no occasion for you to doubt; yet I would have you circumspect (especially if you should come to any contrast with the Masters of Ships) that the Mariners take no advantage of you by a surprize, or una∣wares do you an affront or mischief; you know what sort of beasts they are: For which respect (in occasion) you may by the <HI>Caddies</HI> Order have a guard of his Servants, Souldiers of the Castle, or Janizaries, a dozen or more as there shall bee occasion: But I have no other thing that put's mee in minde of this, but what you your self mention in yours of their Bravadoes: However give them no advantage either by your doubts or over security.</P>
<P N="14">14. Lastly, (for I can at present think of nothing els ma∣terial,) if you want or think you shall want money for your occasions, you must supply your self by Bills of Ex∣change; for there is neither Credit, nor Bills to bee expect∣ed from hence, but what you have, or the Customer. In case it should come to a Vye there, and the <HI>Caddie</HI> were to bee presented, you may secure him by part of the Estate, till you can get Bills, or I provide for you. And so beeing weary and late, go to rest, resting.</P>

<P>YOu know at your departure from hence, I gave you and <HI>Hetherington</HI> a private Commission sealed up, and not to be opened untill occasion and farther advice; which being now confirmed unto me by the letters of the last ship which arrived the Port of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> I have written to <HI>Hetherington,</HI> and inor∣der you to proceed therein.

What care and Industrie I have used in their service for these 8 years, you have in part been an eye Witness to, and they all know the rest; and now (without so much as declaring the cause) to proceed with mee in the manner they do, exceeds the injustice of <HI>Turkie</HI> it self. <HI>Lo∣renzo,</HI> I have ever found you honest and faithfull to mee, in all I ever yet trusted or employed you in, and I am confident you will not fail mee in this that concernes Mee, my Wife, Children, whole Estate; wherein value your self and service to mee at what rate you will, I will recompence it, so you bee faithfull to Mee; which by the Laws of God and that Duty you owe Him you owe Mee also as a sworn Servant, especial∣ly in this of my just Defence, as against the assault of Theevs on the High-way.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Jo. Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo!</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of the 30 of <HI>May</HI> arrived in six daies, won∣dring at the delay of mine, and your want of Order, pres∣sing my dispatche of some further help and supply of Cre∣dit.</P>
<P>Yours accuse the receipt of mine of the 5, 6, and 7 past; want the 17 (which I also doubt miscarried) and mine of the 27. by <HI>Bizadee Chouz</HI> could not then bee arrived you, but before this I hope may bee.</P>
<P>By him you will have received fresh and full Commands in assistance of your power, and by him directions (in case you wanted money) what to do, which way to repair your selvs; <HI>viz</HI> either by Bills of Exchange, or by som of the goods under your hands, in case those that promised payment there, com∣plyed not, &amp; thereby gave you supply; for from hence I found no possibilitie of getting credit for money, and happily the <HI>Caddie</HI> would be contented (if for a reasonable sum) to take Bills of Exchange payable to some of his Friends here.</P>
<P>For advice in what concerned the carriage of your Busi∣ness; those Letters, as also mine of the 3 and 4 present (sent by a several expresses, as duplicates of each other) will have sufficiently instructed you, if arrived; as I hope before this they will bee.</P>
<P>In adjunct to which I send these confirming my former, with this addition only, <HI>viz.</HI> that you proceed to possess your selvs, as soon as you may, with what you can, and the same take into your power as pledg and securitie for the future provision of the Trade, and my indempnity from such unjust pretences as the Companie have raised against Mee. In prosecution whereof, you are to proceed by such gentle steps and paces, as may best and with least non effect your
<PB N="55" REF="42"/> work, and yet secure that you go about: I confess I have required of you a large summ in my last, and when I came to cast up those dammages I may sustein, the summ rather falls short of than exceeds my just doubts of their injust Endea∣vours upon what they have in their powers to prejudice mee in, and I am certified they have made themselvs Masters of in part: However I must content my self with what I may con∣veniently do, and not strein the cord too farr, least it break and requoil upon Mee, to the hazard of that hold I had of more, and what I might have made sure of, and so must leav that still to your discretion to mannage; with this Order notwithstanding, to take into your hands as much as you can of the finest Goods you can get; and where that fails, Cloathes will bee no ill merchandize, and so good security.</P>
<P>The Murmur here riseth every day to greater wonder, where these clouds will dissolve and terminate, which I keep obscure hitherunto, though not unsuspected; the rather, for that they say Captain <HI>Jordan</HI> is coming up, of which I hear not though deny not but hee may, (not complying and con∣forming himself as hee ought) and so who els of those there upon the same occasion: and your Rule is such at least for those 4 or 5 principally directed in my former.</P>
<P>As I promised you in my last, I shall begin my work here much about that time you are directed to set forward there; whereof within three or four daies you will be advised more certainly.</P>
<P>To morrow wee shall have a Court, and I shall there lay the foundation to the work, assuring my self of a denial before-hand, of what I am to demand; and then you may i∣magine what will follow.</P>
<P>My Demands will bee just, and grounded on their own Covenants, backed with Law and Equity, and so long I have seldom forsaken a good Cause; on the other side hitherto ne∣ver pursued an ill, at least contrary to my knowledg and con∣science, which by God's assistance shall bee my guide in this.</P>
<P>I confess I like not so well your lodging in any Merchants house; for 'twill bee impossible for you to keep your designs
<PB N="56" REF="43"/> from view, and your necessarie discourses from the discovery of others in an others house, where you must exspect to bee watched, and your papers sought after, and to have all possi∣ble art and intention used to circumvent you, though (I am of your minde) Mr <HI>Campion</HI> bee one of the best of them, how∣ever a Merchant still.</P>
<P>Next I should bee glad to hear you were removed from the water side, that is out of Marriners roade, and (if in that place you rest in you bee so) you have done the better; but whatever you do, have a care of a surprize, and next of be∣ing betrayed through any sort of confidence, or by any mens friendship whoever; and I the rather write this from some discoverie made out of these Letters which came enclosed un∣der yours, from that partie you think most sure, directed to a friend of his here, which I keep by mee against a fitter oc∣casion.</P>
<P>Beyond which I can say no more at present, having no∣thing of yours material and unanswered, nor further to ad∣vise, but that I rest exspecting your further advice of what you have done, that I may proceed accordingly, resting</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My most Honored Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding some unwillingness in the <HI>Caddie,</HI> to cause those Goods to bee delivered into our possession, which lay sealed up under his Seal, by reason that a great part of them are pretended unto by <HI>Jews, Turks, Armenians, &amp;c.</HI> Wee could not perform that promise wee made your Lordship, in our last, which was to give your Lordship an accompt the next day of what Goods wee had discovered, and of their value; but since understanding the <HI>Caddies</HI> minde by the late visit wee made him, have promised him dollars 1000, and to his sonnes dollars 500, and to the rest of his servants <HI>gratuities,</HI> to come either himself, or send his Son with the <HI>Neipe</HI> to mor∣row morning, and open all the Warehouses of the Nation in generall; and those goods which shall not appear to bee sold and paid for, to deliver into our possession, and the rest to keep sealed up untill wee may have answer from your Lordship concerning this particular; the Language hee un∣derstood better then our former, and hath faithfully promised, if his late indisposition would give him leav, to come and see it effected himself, or at least to send his Son, and caus all the Estate discovered, that is not pretended unto by any Sub∣jects of the Grand Signor, to be delivered into our possessi∣on; and more, if the Master of the <HI>Jonas</HI> should refuse to deliver into our possession, those Goods aboard his Ship, to assist us with some 40 or 50 Souldiers, and to enter his Ship <HI>per</HI> force; which I vow to God and your Lordship, should hee refuse to obey your Lordships Warrant, shall bee attempted; for besides the <HI>Caddies</HI> assistance, I am profered very good assi∣stance from one in port able to master him, but the man be∣ing a good subject, and a poor man withall, promising him some good reward for himself, and some consideration for the
<PB N="58" REF="44"/> time hee hath spent here, for his owners; I hope hee will comply, and not run the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzard of so great a mischief, as his deniall may occasion. Wee have imployed the most cunningst Rogues in all the Country, to see if they can discover any other part of the Nations Estate either hid or lying out, but as yet they have discovered nothing, but hope when this hub∣bub is over, to finde out something; in the mean time shall not bee wanting to use our utmost indeavours, to the effe∣cting of it. If that report be true wee hear, that <HI>Hassan Che∣lobee,</HI> shall bee Customer, and <HI>Bogus</HI> return, wee may bee able to do something, though I fear not much. For though En∣glish mens Goods, yet in anothers Warehous, will finde it a difficult business to prove it sold, and delivered and paid for, and will afterwards rather trust a <HI>Turk</HI> or a <HI>Jew,</HI> then let your Lordship have it. I beseech your Lordship, with the first to inorder us how to dispose of such goods as we hope to have here, and which of them must bee sent up; the chief Com∣modities here are Cloth, Silk, Cotten yarne, Grograin yarn, &amp;c. and they say in Master <HI>Lancelots</HI> hous is store of Tinne, (but Mr <HI>Santhill</HI>'s) I hear to the value of 40 or 50000. dol∣lars; If wee can procure here dollars 100000. for your Lordships use, I hope it may help satisfie your Lordships de∣mands, 'tis but taking the more above, if your Lordship can finde it. If wee can possess our selv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the <HI>Jonases</HI> Goods, which may amount to dollars 50000 more, being as they say half full, and all fine Goods, the <HI>Golden Lyon</HI> brought Dollars 9000 to <HI>Barnardiston;</HI> I shall search narrowly for that, and have some good assurance to finde out where the Money or Goods are; I wish my abilitie answerable to that servent desire I owe and bear to your Honors Service.</P>
<P>This day arrived a <HI>Saitie</HI> from <HI>Marcellis,</HI> and brings hope∣full news from <HI>England.</HI> His Majestie being blockt up in <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> disguised himself, and with a servant or two resolved to run the hazard, and put himself into the mercy of the <HI>Scots,</HI> rather then stand to the curtesie of the Rebels at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and 5. of May, by day break, His Majestie arriv d to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army near <HI>Newarke,</HI> to the wonder and amazement of them
<PB N="59" REF="44"/> all, as by the Letter here inclosed your Lordship will disco∣ver. Where tis advised hee was entertained with all obedi∣dience; they presently gave the Rebbels advice of it, (as by the inclosed) who presently sent the <HI>Scotch</HI> many expressions of their thankfulness, and withall desired them to conduct him to <HI>Warwick</HI> Castle, and there to deliver him into their power: the <HI>Scotch</HI> denyed it, and craved their excuse, His Majestie be∣ing in their power; would first bee assured on what conditi∣ons His Majestie should come, and if his Majestie liked them, and was willing to goe, (otherwise their pardon,) they were His Subjects, and must obey him, and would, and pretended they sought nothing, but the good of both Kingdomes, and they did not see that His Majestie demanded any thing unrea∣sonable; upon the arrivall of this answer at <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commissioners and the Roundheads differed, and the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commissioners told them plainly they demanded things unreasonable for the King to grant. What issue the happy difference may breed is doubtfull, but it is ho∣p d may better His Majesties condition much, they begin at <HI>London</HI> to speak high language against the Parliament, and are doubtfull because Lord <HI>Montross</HI> is marching towards His Majestie with 12000 men.

<P>YEsterday wee received your Lordships of the 4 present, being the Copy of the 3. And to day wee received your Lordships of the 8. and rejoyce to hear your Lordship is in such a readiness for your just demands, and wish your Lord∣ship less trouble, and better success, then wee this day have had, and wee doubt for many dayes shall incounter here: this morning the <HI>Caddies</HI> son, with his <HI>Neipe</HI> and principall Offi∣cers came, and wee began first with the Consulls hous, but before wee began 'twas spoken in the <HI>Caddies</HI> own hous, &amp; all over the Town, our design to seiz what we could finde; about 7 a clock his son came &amp; entred the Consuls hous, &amp; opened all the Warehouses, and took from thence, with <HI>Elfords</HI> and <HI>Keebles,</HI> som 400 Clothes, &amp; 9 Bales Mohairs; we left behinde us 38 Bales of Silk, 13 Bales his servant pretended were sold by his master to Mr. <HI>Brent,</HI> to be paid by Bill of Exchange at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and when advice came the Bills were paid, the Goods should bee delivered; in the mean time they lie in Mr. <HI>Lancelots</HI> Warehouse, with some 40 Clothes, 60 Barrels of Tynne, which Tinne belongs to Mr. <HI>Sainthill,</HI> and sealed up by the <HI>Neipe</HI> and us. Before wee had ended at this house, the whole Town was in an uprore, being fomented by Jews, and som of the young frie left behinde, and proclaimed in the Streets, that the Town would bee undone, the Trade lost and go to wrack, if this was suffered; so that before the Consulls door were so many of the scum of the Town, the Streets were packed thick of them. On the other side, a more unruly enemy threatned worse things, the Master of the <HI>Gol∣den Lyon,</HI> who had before given <HI>Barnardiston</HI> 9000 Dollars at
<PB N="61" REF="45"/> <HI>Cambio,</HI> and had no Goods in his possession, hearing how it would fare with them, lands 40 men at <HI>Barnardistons</HI> house, and vowed hee would have his money or goods, or swore hee would beat down the Town; so likewise the <HI>Jonas</HI> got her sails to yards, that the <HI>Caddies</HI> son and the <HI>Chiouz</HI> de∣sired to let it alone, untill another day, for fear of wors events'; so when they had made an end at <HI>Lancelots</HI> hous, would stay no longer, but promised to come another day. The Estate before mentioned wee carried away in spight of envie, and have put it up in a safe Cane: assoon as this was done, becaus the Captain would not come ashore, I got <HI>Jordan</HI> to go a bord the <HI>Golden Lion,</HI> and know the Master his intent, and to acquaint him with the danger might ensue thereon; all wee could urge was nothing, except▪ hee had satisfaction for his 9000 Dollars; at last told him, if hee knew where his Estate lay, wee would endeavour to help him to it, so hee found it out, and wee delivered it to him, and the man was very well satisfied. And now wee hope to finde little impedi∣ment, and to morrow morning the <HI>Caddies</HI> Son promiseth to come again, and wee doubt not the same day but to make an end. If your Lordship saw the little regard these people bear to the Grand Signors commands, the <HI>Caddie,</HI> or ought els but their private ends, your Lordship would (as wee hope your Lordship will) not blame us if procured but the half of what your Lordships Letter mentions. To morrow (if God bless us) wee shall send your Lordship more pun∣ctuall advice, and for the present crave leav to subscribe our selves,</P>

<P>OUrs of the 16 advised your Lordship, how with the <HI>Cad∣dies</HI> Son, his <HI>Niepe,</HI> and <HI>Chia,</HI> wee had entred the house of Mr <HI>Lancelot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and taken into our possession the Goods wee found therein, not pretended unto by Strangers; and how by the insolency of <HI>Nicolas Terrick,</HI> Master of the <HI>Hope∣well</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormerly the <HI>Golden Lion</HI>) wee were interrupted that day from proceeding any farther; and how by the means of Ca∣ptain <HI>Jordan</HI> wee had pacified that young, rash, and undiscreet Man; and that we hoped the next morning to proceed with∣out interruption, but it fell not out so: for the next morn∣ing wee went to <HI>Barnardiston's</HI> house, thinking to make all sure there; and when wee had begun, in come's the Master with a crew of his own, and said, those Goods hee had re∣ceived were not sufficient to give him satisfaction, and de∣manded of us the rest; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e answered, wee could not give him these Goods wee had sealed up before hee came into Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, for what hee demanded; but assured him, if hee knew of any thing standing out, wee would endeavour the best wee could for his satisfation; upon this, as wee understood since, a young man of the house whispered the Master in his eare, and told him, if hee were not satisfied before the Goods went out of the house, all was lost, hee would never have a penny of it; upon this, away goes the Master aboard with this young man in his company, and loosed his sailes, but threatned nothing; upon this comes in the Jewes and told the <HI>Niepe</HI> and the <HI>Chia,</HI> that the Master would shoot down the Town; but for all our perswasions that hee durst not, a∣way runs the <HI>Niepe</HI> and his Company, and leaves us there a∣lone: so wee resolved to have done it our selves, but the Merchants had so worked with the <HI>Hamalls,</HI> that there
<PB N="63" REF="46"/> was not one to bee seen; so beeing alone, and seeing his Boat coming ashore well mann'd, and fearing a surprize, wee presently repaired to the <HI>Chiouzes,</HI> and desired him to go with us to the <HI>Caddies,</HI> to see if wee could have any better as∣sistance from him. By this time the Town was in a great up∣roar, and the people something too insolent; the <HI>Caddie</HI> to prevent the worst, presently caused the Shops to bee shut up, and immediatly sent for all the chief men of the Town, (who by presents before wee had made our Friends) and there be∣fore them all, and a great company of the Townesmen, cau∣sed the Commands to bee read, and told them how much they were bound to see the Grand Signors Commands put in execution, and what dishonor it would bee for one Ship to command the Town: so after they had disputed the Busi∣ness, the <HI>Caddie</HI> sends an Officer aboard (accompanyed with the Druggerman to the Nation) to know whether hee would hinder the prosecution of the Grand Signors Command or no, and to know his answer; hee presently denyed hee ever intended to shoot at the Town, onely desired his own; so presently after the people were a little appeased, wee went to work again, and so this day have finished all: it beeing done in such confusion, wee cannot give your Lordship that exact accompt you may expect, within a day or two; for then wee will send your Lordship the particulars, with the values, in mean time wee stand upon our guard, having some 20 or 30 of the Souldiers of the Castle to keep watch every night; for, (my Lord!) here is no small hubbub in the Town, and threatning both of us and the Estate, but wee will secure both as well as wee can. Wee have sent your Lordship a rough draught of what wee have, and what wee have left sealed up, and finde it fall short farre of what your Lordship expected: the sooner your Lordship disposes of it, the better; for assure your self, there is daily some designe or other hatching; wee should bee very sorry after all this to have it miscarry, therefore pray (my Lord!) dispose of it (to prevent the worst) as soon as you may.

<P>SInce our last of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June,</HI> there has not much hap∣pened here worth giving your Lordship trouble in these busie times, nor any of your Lordships to answer; wee here∣with send your Lordship enclosed the Copy of what Goods wee have taken from the Merchants houses, authenticated by the <HI>Caddie,</HI> the Original wee keep here by us; by it your Lord-will soon see what will bee fit for <HI>Constantinople</HI> Market, and wee hope your Lordship will the sooner dispose of it: The Lead, Tynne, and Wyer will never vent so well here as at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but how 'twill bee conveyed thither, wee can∣not advise your Lordship; by Land 'twill bee too great a charge for so course a Commodity, and by Sea it will run too great a hazard, except we could get some <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Ship to carry it up, but a farr greater if it lie here, if that Rogue <HI>Moyer</HI> come in, before it and the rest of the Estate bee conveyed away from hence; for the greatest part of the Lead concerns his proper Accompt, and find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng two such Compa∣nions in Port, as the Master of the <HI>Triangle,</HI> and <HI>Hopewell,</HI> by his insolency (for your Lordship well knows how little hee values your Lordships authority) may so startle these discon∣tented and affrighted People here of the Town, that wee shall have a hard task to oppose him or them; but if your Lord∣ship please to clear the Estate from hence first, wee shall bee the better able to deal with them, and his Companions, when wee are rid of it; as for the Cloth, little or none of it will off here, the Town beeing so full at present, that may come up by <HI>Carravan;</HI> and if your Lordship think fit, the Grograin yarn, Mohaire, Wax, &amp;c. Goods that are fit for Christendom, may bee shipt away from hence and consigned
<PB N="66" REF="48"/> to whom your Lordship shall appoint, it's but changing the Covers, and new marking of them. Wee beseech your Lord∣ship to bee as speedy in the disposure of this Estate, as with your Lordships best advantage may bee convenient: For my Lord, the truth is, wee do a little doubt the security of it, as it lies here, and were your Lordship an eie-witness to those insolencies wee daily see here against the <HI>Caddie,</HI> and Grand Signors power, your Lordship would endeavour a speedy removal of it, as wee may seem to bee importunate to your Lordship. For,</P>
<P>The Master and Merchants dare not trust themselvs ashore, onely <HI>Jordan,</HI> and three or-four of the Factors that are good subjects to his Majesty.</P>
<P>Wee have been forced to pay privately some Debts to the Grandees of the Town to stop their mouthes; as that to <HI>Ha∣zume Mamet Aga,</HI> for the Bill of Exchange hee had of Mr <HI>Lancelotts,</HI> and was forced to give them a 11 Clothes for his Debt; so likewise to a <HI>Greek</HI> of the place, one that was ser∣vant to Monsieur <HI>Jean de Puii,</HI> who pretends <HI>Barnardiston</HI> is his Debtor 410 Dollars, hee beeing in Prison; Monsieur <HI>Jean de Puii</HI> desires us to lend the man two Clothes, and hee has obliged himself to us here, that if your Lordship allow not of it, hee will bee responsible for it.</P>
<P>Wee have been forced to deposite some of the Clothes for Dollars 1000, at 24 <HI>per Cent.</HI> interest, not finding any one that will trust us for <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and I hope this will serve our turnes whil'st wee are here: however, if your Lordship can furnish us with any Credit in occasion, it will bee the better.</P>
<P>The last night arrive Newes here, that your Lordship has imprisoned the whole Nation at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but from which of the Nations hands wee cannot discover, and how your Lordship makes large Demands upon them, and has declared Master <HI>Wylde</HI> uncapable of the charg of Consul, having taken the Covenant, which makes all these that are left here almost at their wits ends.

<P>YOu will have wondered much I am sure, why in all this time you have not heard from mee, amidst so much nois and ado; but I have been constant to my old Rule, I love not to trouble my self in hurlies of this nature, which must come to the rule of Reason at last. I have stood still to see these mad people spend 30000 Dollars at least, onely for a Command to release those Goods you have sequestred, and
<PB N="69" REF="49"/> to bring you and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> up to the Port; and this they have not in their hands neither, it stayes for the payment of Dol∣lars 5000 more; and then I am promised another quite con∣trary; which if the other should succeed to their desires, you may expect by an express, to bee there assoon as theirs, if not before; In the mean time I send you here the Copy of their Arze to the <HI>Vizier;</HI> to the end the <HI>Caddie</HI> there may bee ad∣vised of their falshood, and of their attempts against him here, which I will never forsake him in; and so you may assure him what ever it cost mee; hee having done nothing for ought I see or here, but what is justified to him by Capitulati∣ons, several Commands, the <HI>Viziers</HI> own Servant, and <HI>Chiouzes</HI> sent expresly to see it executed; on the other side, you may upon this make Mazars of the late insolency of the Nations taking away the Captain of a Ship out of the Consuls house every day (not having their will) menacing the Town with shot and Armes, upon the least occasion; threatning the <HI>Cad∣die</HI> and his Officers in such sort, as that they dare not execute their Offices, and the Grand Signors Commands; with such other circumstances as you shall hold sit, and bee b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter privy unto, and able to make good; as perswading the people of the place to mutiny and disorders, &amp;c. insomuch that you were forced to require a guard, &amp;c. for which, if need bee, you are to desire the <HI>Caddie</HI> in occasion to afford you <HI>Arze</HI> to the Port, and of your behaviour in that charge committed to you: I hope and doubt not but you have taken good wit∣ness of what Goods and Estates you have taken out of their Houses, &amp;c. for amongst the rest of their Avaniaes and villa∣nies they dayly coine, they say you have taken from them all their Estates; which they pretend to bee sometimes to the value of 600000 Dollars; sometimes 300000; and sometimes 200000. I heartily wish it were but as much as the least of these summes, if not the most; whatever it bee, more then what you last sent mee in yours of the 19 of <HI>June</HI> (if ought more, which I believ not) I pray send mee word, and by a Horseman alwaies express; for yours of the 16 fell into the Rebells hands, and your last gave mee no Copy of it. What
<PB N="70" REF="50"/> noise soever you encounter, I charge you budg not out of your place, or posture; for the storm is over, and God bee thanked I have broken their waves. And I doubt not but you will see a calme game played for the after one; for which I have fair blots, if any of them hit; hitherunto it hath not cost mee an Asper, for till the Officers bellies were prettily well filled at my neighbours, I knew they would bee costly guests on such occasions; now having been feasted with them a day, two, or three, I shall provide a banquet for them too, but at their cost (take my word) that are the occasion of my trouble. By the next express I pray send mee back those Ac∣counts of Consulage I gave you <HI>John Hetherington</HI> under <HI>Brents</HI> and <HI>Lancelotts</HI> hands, and advise mee whether you have learnt any more of those particulars <HI>Read</HI> told you of; and whe∣ther you have <HI>Lancelotts</HI> papers and Accompts under your power; and bee sure whatever you have, hold, and make them safe. 'Tis a wonder to mee I confess I hear not oftner from you, in your Instructions requiring it so strictly, and in every Letter putting you in mind of it; let mee hear here∣after though it bee nothing but Duplicates, every three dayes at the farthest; and bee sure (if you send about any important business) that you send a Horseman; if with duplicates, by Footmen: you must send some one or other with them, a day or a half daies journey, or els you may give them for lost; for these people lay all their wayes they can for interception. I have not more to trouble you with at present, but to desire you not to bee troubled with these troubles and encounters, that might justly bee exspected in a business of this nature, though not driven to this height; but the Sun it self hath its time of declining, and so Mr. <HI>Lancelott</HI> and his Gompany.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHat I delivered you in Court, and demanded as in your generall answer aforegoing, I acknowledged for truth, and for the grounds of my demands then expressed for so much as to that day I had been advertised by four seve∣rall dispatches touching the beginning of the <HI>Levant</HI> Compa∣nies endeavours against me in <HI>England,</HI> and here; but whe∣ther all or any of you bee certified thereof or no, it concerns mee as little to inquire, as to believ one way or other: sup∣posing it little for your advantage to confess it, if you bee; however, this I must profess, that the first alarmes I had there∣of in likelihood, were about three months since, and they
<PB N="76" REF="53"/> came from some of your selvs, by name Mr <HI>John Wyld,</HI> Mr <HI>Thomas Berkley, John Tye,</HI> and <HI>John Plumer,</HI> all of one hous yet, and of this place: Moreover, by report from the three later, about that time, that there was an Ambassador, by name Sir <HI>Peter Killegrew</HI> comming, who was said to have the Kings Commission, and other Orders to surprize mee, and take my charge, &amp;c. Of this latter news I confess I am not yet advised, though but this last week I was assured that Mr <HI>Thomas Berk∣ley</HI> should say to several men of this place, English and o∣thers, it would not bee long before they had anothar Ambas∣sador here, and then they should see great and strange altera∣tions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That securiry demanded of you in a case of this nature, I conceiv the most improvident and inconsiderate amongst you (were it in his own) would hold it for reasonable and just, and where ever this caus shall come to bee referred, I presume will bee esteemed accordingly, as well by the Rules of Religi∣on, as that natural policy and justice which every creature takes to it self, and for it's own defence; whereof (at this di∣stance from resort to other justice, having the power of a Judg, and a publick Minister on the place) I intend not to bart my self, lest another day I may bee judged and condem∣ned improvidently and pusillanimously guilty of my own unjust surprize, losse of my Estate, ruine and beggery of my Family, by such illegal and unchristian practises.</P>
<P>Though you may say, and I deny not, that as servants and Factors you are not criminally bound to answer for the of∣fences or injustice of your Masters; yet in actions of this nature, having Estates of theirs in your hands, by whose means the violence aforementioned is obtruded on mee, <HI>viz.</HI> My Estate seized, my Person intended to bee sequestred, and Place violently surprized, without so much as intimation of the caus; I do in justice require security of you as servants and Factors to the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, by whom these things are prosecuted, and out, and by the means of their Estates in your hands, and to the value before mentioned, for my in∣dempn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tie; which demand of securitie, I desire you to believ
<PB N="77" REF="53"/> and credit mee in, was not a begging question, but a milde overture to you, and a quiet prosecution of that rule of ju∣stice, whereby I have for near these eight years now governed amongst you; before I proceed in such course as the neces∣sity of the cause would otherwise inforce me to, of farther prejudice, and happilie inrepairable dammage to you refusing; which I lay before you, for better consideration this, second time, desiring you to believ that this proceeds not of vanitie, nor out of any relenting resolution, or want of power, from the least doubt of that dust some of you have improvidently raised to your own ruines, if I should pursue the advantage of the justness of my Cause; but meerly out of that desire I have of your better accommodation in my safetie: if you can by fair means, see you give way to it in the Propositions laid before you; and if not, that I may hereby (as in the sight of God and all his Angels) wash my hands, and free my conscience of all mischief that may follow, and of his ruine and misfortune, whoever complies not in his proportion, in that just way proposed, to secure mee, and to free himself and the publique Interest; to which end, if this bee not of force enough, you may bee sure of more: And so Gentlemen, with∣out further Complements, or regret to the Person of any, I rest, as hitherto you have found mee, and I desire to bee continued,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worshipfull,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SIrs, at present wee have our heads and hands full, and all little enough to preserve your Estates from devouring, and our selves from that evill consequence might ensue upon such unheard of proceedings and intentions, as have been long in private agitation; but when the Monster came to the birth, there wanted strength to bring forth; so in a good hour wee may say, the snare is broken, and doubt not the devices of the Craftie is frustrate by him, whose Almightiness shews it self most, when wee mortalls are least capable to help our selves. Wee shall, according to our obligation, give your Worships some accompt of the last progressions of his Lord∣ship Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow,</HI> whom his Majestie sent hither Am∣bassador, and to bee a Protector of your Estates, and our Per∣sons; how he hath performed this charge and dutie formerly, your Worships have in part heard; what hath happened of late, wee shall now chiefly insist upon.</P>
<P>After his Lordship had caused the stay of the ships in this Port and at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> under pretens of this States requiring it in respect of their Wars with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Sampson</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> Merchant, having been here almost seven moneths, to the great loss and dammage of Ships and Goods; Hee picks a quarrell with the Factory of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> for not comply∣ing according to his Order, in the payment of their parts of the last Leviation money; and hereupon sends down <HI>John Hetherington</HI> one of his servants, a most lewd, debaucht, pro∣phane, riotous fellow, (yet his Lordships Kinsman) accom∣panied with two <HI>Chiouzes,</HI> two <HI>Druggermen,</HI> a Janizarie, and other Servants, to proceed with those who should refuse to pay their Leviation according to the instructions hee had
<PB N="79" REF="54"/> given the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo Zuma</HI> Druggerman; but before the arrivall of these Agents, the Nation there had undertaken the payment by an obligatory letter to his Lord∣ship; this would not satisfie, nor deposition of goods for security, untill answer should come from hence of the pay∣ment of their Bills of exchange which was tendred; but the second day after their arrivall, <HI>Hetherington</HI> and his retinue goes to the <HI>Caddies,</HI> and thither causes the Consull and all the Nation to come; where it was pretended they had laden the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> with Corn, and sent her away, and there∣fore by vertue of an Imperiall Command (very privately here procured) the Consull, and six more of the Nation were de∣livered into the hands of the <HI>Chiouz,</HI> and so brought up hi∣ther, not being suffered to return to their own houses, but put a day and a night into an offensive dark place, the doors and windowes not only shut, but nayled upon them, not suffering either their Friends or Servants to come at them, or a win∣dow open till the evening, for which also they paid Dollars 100. In this disgracefull manner they were brought hither, where they have been since the 22 of the last moneth, Priso∣ners in his Lordships house to the 21 present, notwithstand∣ing they had complyed in paying the Leviation moneys in lesse then a week after their arrivalls; and by fair promises put off from day to day, for their dispatch to their business <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which could not but much suffer by their absence; their Magazines and Counting-houses continuing sealed from the time of their attachments; the Ships not permitted to lade or depart, though empty; and no debts due to them would bee paid in this their absence and time of distra∣ction.</P>
<P>The Leviation monies being satisfied (of which Dollars 31000, his Lordship forced into <HI>Cancellaria</HI>) and wee of <HI>Smyrna</HI> expecting no more rubbs in the way, his Lordship the 16 instant calls a Court, and there declared, that of what monies had been collected, there would not remain much on the old Accompt; therefore provision must bee made for the future growing charge, for so much as upon this pretended
<PB N="80" REF="55"/> imbargoe, no Ships would come in haste, and hee and his must bee maintained, which hee would provide for; here∣upon, when wee could not do otherwise, Dollars 25000 was promised, half by this Factory, for which his Lordship cau∣sed us to enter into Bond, as hee did those of <HI>Smyrna</HI> for the other half; this being effected, which we should not neither altogether have been so ready to have complyed in, but there∣by to put a period to all other demands, and enable our selves to proceed in our business for your Worships better service.</P>
<P>The 18 present his Lordship calls another Court, and af∣ter a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guing of some generall matters, with a seeming sadness tells us how that hee had been wronged by fals information from hence and <HI>Smyrna</HI> (but hee was so farr from proving it, as that hee would not discover so much as whom hee su∣spected) and thereupon the <HI>Levant</HI> Company at home, had by means of the Parliament procured sequestration of his Estate and Lands in <HI>England,</HI> and endeavoured to surprize his Per∣son; and therefore according to Religion, Reason, and com∣mon policy hee ought to secure himself and his Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es: and thereupon hee departed from us, requiring the Nation speedily to resolve of some present satisfaction that might se∣cure his Estate at home, and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson here, otherwise hee vow∣ed to God, hee would sudd nly do it himself, with no little disadvantage to our selvs and Principals: These strange, un∣reasonable, and unexpected demands, filled us with amaze∣ment, not knowing what answer to give to such a ground∣less demand; wee desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Secretary Signor <HI>Dominico</HI> to know his Lordships more particular desires therein, that so wee might better understand him, and to put his demands in∣to such a moderate way, as hee might receive some satisfacti∣on; hee returned us answer, that wee must resolve to satisfie his aforesaid demands b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore wee went thence; whereupon the Gates were shut, and also Guards set upon us, that wee should not converse with any, or convey so much as a Paper out of doors. Thus wee are all surpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, made close Pri∣soners, and our Counting-house, Ware-house, and Cham∣bers
<PB N="81" REF="55"/> sealed up, to make sure of our Goods and Estates there also: continuing in this sad condition all night, and finding no motion to proceed from his Lordship to declare himself farther, four or five of us was appointed by the generality, personally to crave his Lordships particular desires and de∣mands of us; whose answer was, that the lowest value hee could put upon his Lands the Company had sequestred, was 25000 pounds <HI>sterling;</HI> and for the loss hee should su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain by beeing put out of the Ambassadorship, which hee saith his Majesty hath granted him for his life, therefore the Strangers Consulage hee rates at Dollars 5000 <HI>per annum,</HI> which for the clear gain of seven years to come, is Dollars 35000. for which hee declared that hee would not accept of any perso∣nal security or obligation whatsoever; but a present dispositi∣on of Dollars 160000 in Money or Goods, into his own hands must bee made: And if to this wee would not conde∣scend, hee told us, that at the last Sacrament had vowed to God (as hee doth now) to sacrifice his Estate, Himself, Wife and Children, for the execution of this his absolute intent; and till then, neither our Persons, Estates, Ships here, or at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> should bee free. Wee told his Lordship, that finding not any of us had heard of any such things was (or intend∣ed to bee) done against him by the Company, it would give us great satisfaction to shew us those advices hee grounded this pretence upon: To this no answer was then given by himself, but dismissed us, leaving it to our last and speedy re∣solution, because hee was resolved to strike home. Immedi∣ately after, hee sent us word by a second, that hee could not let his Honour descend so low, as to shew his advices to any; this empty reply gave us too much reason, not onely to con∣clude this to bee a feigned pretence, but made us suspect his intention and aim was at all the Nations Estate in the Coun∣trey; and therefore wee returned him this reasonable and defensive answer, as your Worships will particularly perceive by the inclosed Paper: whereunto is adjoyned hit Reply to that our answer, as hee pretended, though it appears it was intended before, it beeing dated a day before our answer.
<PB N="82" REF="56"/> Whil'st thus wee continued, it happened that those four of us were fortunately absent from Court that day, who hearing of our conditions, wherefore, and why wee were thus detain∣ed, and what an ill period these proceedings tended unto, if not timely &amp; prudently prevented, they used their best endeavors to free us and your livelihoods from the claws of tyranny and covetousness; they applyed themselvs to Signor <HI>Illustrissimo Coppes</HI> the States of <HI>Hollands</HI> Agent, who as hee was ever a friend and favourer of the Nation, so now hee gave us good and great testimony thereof in this our greatest need and ex∣tremity: and chiefly by his means with a summ of Money; to∣gether with the clamors of the Jews, and many other of the Grand Signors Subjects against this our present abuse, and destruction of future Trade; The <HI>Vizier</HI> (whom they had well and fully possessed with the truth of all things) after three daies imprisonment sent a <HI>Chiouz</HI> for us to his Lordships hous, from whence wee were carried before the <HI>Vizier,</HI> who much upbraided his Lordship, saying, hee never gave him Commands for such proceedings, notwithstanding his Lord∣ships avaneous allegations against his own Nation, by saying an English ship at <HI>Smyrna</HI> was laden with Powder, Ammuni∣tion, &amp;c, and there resided for assistance of the Turks Ene∣mies, and other the like abuses and destructive courses against those here, tending not onely to the confiscation of Ships and Estates, but the risgo of enslaving our bodies, if not the loss of all or some of our lives, had his hellish Plots taken effect. The next day after our general Commitment, arrives five more of our fellow Factors from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> there seized upon and made Prisoners, and so by his Lordships command, in that nature brought to his hous, and put amongst us, not∣withstanding the advice from their correspondents hence was at <HI>Smyrna</HI> (before their departure thence) that their part of leviation Money was all paid in here, yet their leviation, with ⅓ more in Moneys and Goods was taken again from them by his impudently impious Ministers there, and all the rest of their Goods continued sealed up: so the intent (as your Worships may plainly perceive) was no other than first to
<PB N="83" REF="56"/> get the moneys here payed, then to seize upon their Persons, and next to take away and secure their Estates; thereby to prevent a just, reasonable, and natural defence; and now it too plainly appears, (because his Lordships imployers had ta∣ken course no messengers should come unto us;) Horsemen are daily dispeeded unto us by our Friends at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> advising us to the 20 instant, of the unnatural and devouring progres∣sions they had there made, which was done by the assistance of the <HI>Caddie,</HI> whom they had well bribed, beginning to act there at the same time as wee were here all imprisoned, so there was no intent of staying for our answer to his extra∣vagant demands. They first fell upon Mr <HI>Lancelots</HI> house, thence proceeded all throughout the Nation; so that they have not only taken away all the Goods, Moneys, and effects whatsoever they could finde in their houses, at home or a∣broad, but broke open and ransack'd all our Chambers, Trunks, and Counting-houses, which mounteth to a farr greater value than his demands of Dollars 160000; and by large promises to Informers endeavour to discover and take what is owing them abroad by people of the Countrey, and have so threatned our Friends and Servants to deliver our Books, and declare where's more of our Estates, that they are constrained to leave our naked houses to the open world, and betake themselves to the Ships in Port for refuge: All this it seems cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts them not, but are contriving Provisi∣ons by Policy and force of some Rogues of the Countrey, to unlade what Goods the Nation had put aboard the <HI>Jonas.</HI> For all which, wee have not onely the advice of our distressed Friends there, but such infallible information as your Wor∣ships may perceive by the inclosed authentick Copies of Let∣ters from his Instruments at <HI>Smyrna</HI> to his Lordship here; by which you will too plainly perceive his Lordship did and still doth aime at all the Estate the Nation had in the Coun∣trey; and for that cause hee was so much enraged for the de∣parture of the <HI>Hercules,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> whose Goods hee esteemed as so much loss to him.</P>
<P>Wee have been now seven dayes out of his Lordships
<PB N="84" REF="57"/> hands, and are endeavouring to free that Estate they have al∣ready taken at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> as also to defend our selves, and your Estates in future from him, and free the Ships out of Port (which no question at last will bee proved have been detain∣ed by his Lordship to this ill purpose;) And if possible, to procure the return of Dollars, 20 in 30000, his Lordship hath unavoidably forced from us in the Leviation Accompt, upon strange pretences. All which (by the assistance of our obliged and worthy Friend <HI>Sig. Illustrissimo Cuppes,</HI> together with the expence of Dollars 30 in 40000, to the <HI>Vizier</HI> and other Turkish Ministers) wee doubt not but speedily to eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct; for without this honest defensive remedy, wee can ex∣pect nothing but ruine to all your Estate in the Countrey, which still hee threatneth, and endeavours by all his devillish policy and means to effect; but the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and the two <HI>Cad. deleskiers,</HI> who are our Judges, are so possest with the truth and reason of our Caus. as well by the people of the Coun∣trey, as our selves, that they have given us full assurance by promises, protestations, and sound probabilities, that our just demands shall bee accomplished, for which wee all faithfully and earne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly endeavor night and day, and so do hourly ex∣pect a good determination of it; and till there bee an issue or s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttlement given to this our confused condition (which wee h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe will not continue for many dayes) no particular Prin∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al must expect advice from any Factor here, because no private man can fitly advise any thing till the general Business bee better ordered: And as wee proceed therein, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall by all waies and conveyances give your Worships a true and ex∣act Accompt. Wee do humbly beseech your Worships to ac∣knowledg the good Offices of the States Agent to their Am∣bassador with you, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully certifie him that <HI>Illustr. Sign. Cuppes</HI> appeared no waies against his Lordship as Ambassador, or trenching on the Kings Honour, but respectfully and mo∣destly for the safety of your Estates.</P>
<P>To particularize all passages and circumstances in this Bu∣siness, would prove more troublesom than needfull to your Worships, so please to accept of this Relation; for this is the
<PB N="85" REF="57"/> present state of yours and our condition; which though not so well as wee could wish, yet better than wee could ima∣gine: for the hand was up, the match lighted, and a little more time would have blown up all.

<P>His Lordships Cause is so bad, that <HI>Signor Domenico</HI> your Secretary, <HI>Signor George,</HI> and all other Druggermen, have not onely declined his Lordship, but apply themselvs to us, (and especially the former). In fine, wee conceive his Lord∣ship findes his former bad Proceedings have made him unca∣pable to return into <HI>England,</HI> and also uncertain of his Resi∣dence here; which, together with the improvident use hee hath made of his golden time, that hee intended to seize up∣on all Hee and his unworthy In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ruments could catch hold of; for to this pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pose hee diverted the <HI>Golden Fleeces</HI> advan∣tagious designe for <HI>Venice;</HI> which at first was approved and cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by his own consent, and occasioned her Factor here, to whom shee was consigned, to let her him to fraight, that so Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Family, and undue gott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Estate may be convey∣ed (as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d) into <HI>France,</HI> with whose Ambassador, there hath been often a more than ordinary correspondency of late.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Before the sealing up of our Letter, wee have procured an Imperial Command for the recovering of the Estate into our hands, taken away at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> as also for the attaching the Persons, and bringing up of those good Agents of his Lord∣ships
<PB N="86" REF="58"/> hither, to answer their proceedings and behaviour: the obtaining of which command, wee are not a little glad of, beeing our obligatory Testimony of the <HI>Viziers</HI> beeing our friend, and tyes him thereby to continue so, which wee hope effectually to finde, two daies hence, when his Lordship is to appear with us before him; but in case hee refuseth (as alrea∣dy hee hath don) the <HI>Vizier</HI> will give sentence against him.</P>
<P>Your Worships may bee pleased to take notice, that his Lordships chief Counsellor, in these his undue proceedings, is Mr <HI>Henry Hyde,</HI> of whose good service in your former oc∣casions at the <HI>Morea,</HI> wee need not to give testimony; but can assure your Worships, that since his comming hither, hee hath occasioned great disturbance amongst the Nation; and now at last, (had the design before mentioned taken effect) might have raised his decayed fortunes, by the ruine of yours and our Estates; but thanks bee to God, the Counsel of <HI>A∣chitophel</HI> is turned into foly. And for your late Treasurer <HI>John Woolf,</HI> the satisfying of whose debts hath so mounted the last leviation, hee is so farr from acknowledging the cur∣tesies done in acquitting him from his Creditors, that hee is becom assistant (though a weak one) to his Lordship in the proceeding aforementioned; And having deserted <HI>Gallata,</HI> with Mr <HI>Henry Hyde,</HI> resides at his Lordships, laying their heads togethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in contriving mischief against those from whom they have had their maintenance.</P>
<P>In case your Worships should not bee in a posture to pro∣cure an Ambassador so soon as you may desire, that you would pleas in the interim, and assoon as may bee to obtain a Letter from his Majestie to the Grand Signor or Vizier, in approbation and acknowledgment of what is done; and that his Lordships bee not nimbler then your Worships in getting the like against us which doubtless hee will endea∣vour. Wee shall not farther inlarge at present, but intend shortly, when all things shall bee fully and absolutely set∣tled, to write to your Worships again. So wee rest.</P>
<P>At instant a Copie of his Lordships Letter, with others directed to him, beeing come to hand, wee send them here∣with?
<PB N="87" REF="58"/> and from <HI>Smyrna</HI> are advised that the persons of <HI>He∣therington</HI> and the Druggerman are detained aboard our Ships there; and by this time the Command is with them, which will warrant the bringing them up, with their Papers that are also aboard; <HI>per</HI> which the Plot will more plainly appear. To morrow wee expect his Lordships appearance before the <HI>Vizier,</HI> when wee have hopes to reward the trouble hee in∣tended others, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The Factors general Letter from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> dated the <HI>4</HI> of <HI>July, 1646.</HI> to the Levant Company.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worshipfull Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may pleas you, our last from hence was <HI>per</HI> the ship <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> advising his Lordships proceedings for another leviation for discharging your Debts at <HI>Costantinople,</HI> beeing then informed that the whole amounted unto Dollars 118109; and how wee were resolved to withstand it, untill your Worships further pleasure should bee signified unto us concerning the same, for such reasons as wee then presumed to lay open unto you; and that in the mean time wee had presented our grievances to his Lordships gracious perusal, the Copy whereof went annexed to our said Letter, to both which you may pleas to have reference.</P>
<P>The 24 of <HI>March</HI> following, our Consul called a Court, and declared his Lordships answer to our said Letter, disli∣king our proceedings; and by a new Order prohibited the lading of Goods, and receiving them on board, and the de∣parture of Ships, untill the said leviation were paid accor∣ding to his former Order, and Schedule now sent down, shewing each man his proportionable part for this Factory of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> amounting in all to Dollars 54950, and for the Factory at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to Dollars 56000; is together Dol∣lars 110950. Whereupon, wee generally desired that his Lordship would bee pleased to suspend the execution of the said Order of leviation, untill such time wee should receiv your Worships farther Order about it, without which, wee our selvs were like to pay it out of our own Purses, as in the last leviation; receiving since particular Orders from some of our principals, not to pay any leviations, otherwise it should bee for our own Accompts, and not theirs.</P>
<P>The 24 of <HI>Aprill,</HI> the Consull called another Court, sig∣nifying
<PB N="89" REF="59"/> unto us that his Lordship did require an accompt for the departure of the Ship <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Suc∣cess,</HI> contrary to his Lordships Commands, there beeing an Officer of the <HI>Viziers</HI> come down to apprehend Captain <HI>Tho. Porter,</HI> and to carrie him up to <HI>Constantinople</HI> (which Ships departed at their own pleasures, beeing not in our pow∣ers to stay them.) And that concerning the leviation it was inevitable, and his Lordship was resolved upon it, and there∣fore would sorce us unto it, and expect repair of Honor from the Delinquents; whereupon fearing his Lordships farther displeasure, which might beget som greater inconveniencies amongst us, wee presumed to yield unto his Lordships Com∣mands, by way of a submissive orderly complyance, and con∣form our selvs unto the payment of our parts of the said le∣viation, in proportion to the Estates wee received on the last-general Ships, <HI>Hercules, Sampson,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna-Merchant,</HI> ac∣cording to our particular assessments; as appeareth by our general Letter presented his Lordship, and entred in <HI>Cancella∣ria,</HI> grounded upon the result of this dayes Court; desiring his Lordship would bee pleased to allow us four moneths time for payment, for such reasons as wee have alledged in the same.</P>
<P>The 6 of <HI>May,</HI> the Consull told us hee had received other letters from his Lordship, prohibiting not onely the lading of Goods, and the departure of any Ships, untill the leviation bee settled; but also therein more fully signifies and declares, that untill the Grand Signors Fleet bee gone forth hee canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> permit any Ship, either at <HI>Constantinople</HI> or here, to lade or bee dispeeded, and that accordingly his Lordship is so requi-of this State. And in like manner hath ordered and com∣manded those whom it concerns both above, and in this Port to observ the same. And moreover farther witnessing, which accordingly (as hee said) hee was bound to acquaint us how that the Embargoe at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and here was seconded, and his Lordship to avoid farther dangers and inconvenien∣cies to the Publick, could not refuse his consent thereun∣to.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="60"/>
<P>The 10 of <HI>May</HI> arrived here Mr <HI>John Hetherington,</HI> a ser∣vant to his Lordship, and Signor <HI>Lorenzo Zuma,</HI> Greek, one of his Lordships Druggermen from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who the next morning moved our Consul to call a Court for the Na∣tion; where being assembled, the Consul told the said <HI>He∣therington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> that their desires were performed, and therefore required them to deliver what they had in Commis∣sion from his Lordship; who produced an Order of the 27 <HI>April,</HI> directed to the Consul and us, for payment of the said Leviation forthwith, or else to proceed according to his far∣ther Order, Warrant, and Instructions in such behalf, and we to bee answerable to such loss, dammage, and inconvenien∣cies as may ensue thereby. To which wee answered, that the Leviation was subscribed unto, and therefore desired the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to stay four or five daies, untill his Lordship should return answer to our Letter of the 24 of <HI>April:</HI> the said <HI>Lorenzo</HI> told us, hee would retire and peruse his Lordships Commission, and in two houres return, to have a more full and satisfactory answer from us: which be∣ing expired, hee declared that his Lordships Commission re∣quired forthwith ready Money or Goods; (beeing his Instru∣ction, from which hee could not vary.) Whereupon Mr <HI>John Lancelot</HI> first answered (as hee was a Merchant) he could not deposite his Cloth, for his Credits sake, but would give his Bills for his and Mr. <HI>Dixwell Brents</HI> proportionable part of the leviation, payable at <HI>Constantinople per</HI> Mr <HI>Thomas Pi∣got,</HI> at five daies sight into his Lordships <HI>Cancellaria;</HI> which was refused, unless they would deposite the value in Cloth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part more towards charges, in the possession of him the said <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> which they said again, for their Credits sake (as they were Merchants) could not consent unto; so referred themselvs unto the said <HI>Lorenzo's</HI> farther proceed∣ings, if these proffers would not bee accepted of, beeing not possible for them at present to procure Moneys at Interest, or otherwise.</P>
<P>The like conditions wee all in generall profered for our proportionable parts, but were refused by the said <HI>Hetherington</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="60"/> and <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> whereupon the Consull told them, they had all our assents for payment of the leviation; and if that, with such reasons and proffers as wee propounded, might not bee satisfactory, the Consull and wee in generall referred our selves to the said <HI>Lorenzoes</HI> farther proceedings.</P>
<P>After this, the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> presently re-repaired to the <HI>Caddies,</HI> accompanied with a prime <HI>Chiouz</HI> of the <HI>Visiers,</HI> and declared their farther Commissions; after publication whereof, the <HI>Caddie</HI> sent for the Consull, and all our Nation, where the Capitulations were first taken away by Warrant, and the Consull in a most barbarous manner was laid hold on, with <HI>Dixwell Brent, Daniell Edwards, John Pixley, Samuel Barnardiston, George Hanger,</HI> and <HI>James Moye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and committed Prisoners into the custody of the said <HI>Chiouz</HI> and Officers, and transported to a house (taken by them on purpose) where they were violently, and in a formidable manner thrust into a dark Chamber, and at length were for∣ced to present Dollars 300, to have a window set open to give them light and ayre; the Consull telling the said <HI>Hether∣ington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> before hee was surprised, in the presence of the <HI>Caddies,</HI> that neither hee, or the Nation, had any wayes transgressed the Grand Signors or his Lordships Commands, and that hee did not fear what they could do unto him, no not so much as to dye, in performance of his faith and trust to the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, whom hee had truly served, as likewise for his love and affection hee bore to the Nation here under his charge, whom hee would never betray, hoping shortly to see his own Countrey again. And in two hours after, the said <HI>Hetherington, Lorenzo,</HI> and <HI>Chiouz, Caddie,</HI> and <HI>Neipe,</HI> sealed up all our Counting-houses, Magazines, and some Chambers; and in two dayes after transported the Pri∣soners overland, up to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where they were deli∣vered to his Lordships power and safe custody; wee in the mean time being left like so many Sheep without a Shepherd, and ignorant where to seek protection.</P>
<P>The next day after departure of these Prisoners, the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> sealed up our Cloth in our own

<P>The 18 day of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</HI> at the instance of the said <HI>Hetherinton</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> the remainder of us left here behinde met toge∣ther, where the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> told us wee had not brought in our bills of Exchange for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for the parts of our Leviation, and ⅓ part more; unto which wee answered, wee had complyed with his Lordships Commands, in all wil∣ling and obedient manner, according to our present possibi∣lities, untill wee should bee able to satisfie the same with our ready Monies here, or by our Bills payable in <HI>Constantinople</HI> at 5 dayes sight, wherein wee promised to use our utmost indea∣vors, hoping to redeem our Cloth again, which wee had deposited, and they sealed up, for our proportionable parts of the Leviation.</P>
<P>In few dayes after arrived here one of the principallest <HI>Chi∣ouzes</HI> of the Grand Signor with new commands sent down by his Lordship, by vertue whereof the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> seized upon the Persons of <HI>John Ball, Henry Davey, Phillip Farwell, Nathaniell Barnardiston,</HI> and <HI>John Ingoldsby,</HI> who were committed prisoners to the said <HI>Chiouz,</HI> who used them with some humanity, and sent up the next day to <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> to be delivered unto his Lordships power; after whose departure (all Law being set aside) the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> by this command came down, opened all our Ware∣houses, and by violence carried all our Goods away into se∣verall Canes of the <HI>Turks,</HI> as well what they had sealed up, for the Leviation, as all other Goods of what nature soever they could finde, unless it were such as was sealed up, and belonged to <HI>Turks,</HI> and other of the Grand Signors Subjects, and left many of us so bare, that wee had not wherewithall to afford us a piece of Bread, to ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p life and soul together, onely bare promises. The said <HI>Chiouz</HI> remaining behinde, put us dayly into great fears that wee should all bee sent up, or clapt up here in Prison, which caused many of us to repair on board the ship for succour, here being in harbour the
<PB N="93" REF="61"/> Ships <HI>Rainbow, Jonas, Hopewell,</HI> and <HI>Triangle.</HI></P>
<P>In all which time of this distraction and sufferings our miseries have been much condoled by the chief <HI>Turks</HI> and in∣habitants of this place, who seem to sympathise with us in our sad conditions; and had not the Commands been so powerfull, the whole Town would have risen up in our de∣fens and protection, who have privately advised of these abu∣ses, which as they themselves confess, are like to ruine, not only this scale, but that of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Constantinople</HI> also, to the dishonor of the Grand Signor, and ruine of many of his Subjects, and of a profitable and acceptable friend (our Nati∣on) to become a potent enemy against them.</P>
<P>The 28 of <HI>June</HI> came letters from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> advising the <HI>Visiers</HI> Order for rescuing both Factories from his Lord∣ships imprisonment, and particular advice to some of us here left, for apprehending the Persons of the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and to keep them in safe Custodies on board our Ships, fearing (wee having no order as yet to receiv our E∣states out of their possessions) they might convey our said Estates away, or sell them for half their worth, and so make their private escapes out of Town, expecting dayly a <HI>Chiouz</HI> to carry up their Persons to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and to free our Goods, hoping all will go well again for us. Hereupon the very same day, the said <HI>Hetherington</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> (without any nois or rumor) were by the Marriners conveyed on board severall Ships from the said <HI>Hetherintons</HI> lodging; <HI>viz. He∣therington</HI> on broad the <HI>Triangle, William Hodges</HI> Commander; and <HI>Lorenzo</HI> on board the <HI>Hopewell, Nicholas Terrick</HI> Com∣mander; where now they remain, to the contentment of the inhabitants here, who daily expect their sending up to the Port, there to answer to such crimes and insolencies as shall bee objected and proved against them.</P>
<P>Thus wee have presumed plainly and distinctly (according∣ly as wee conceive it becomes us) though briefly, to present unto your Worships perusall, the whole process of his Lord∣ships proceedings against us here in <HI>Smyrna</HI> (since our last) according to our experience of the passages; by which your
<PB N="94" REF="62"/> Worships may easily conjecture his Lordships farther inten∣tions. And for what hath occurred at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> your Worships will receiv by this conveyance, advise to both which wee pray you to bee referred; which being taken into your deliberate considerations, may afford such future means of protection, and incouragement to enter into a way of set∣ling this Turky Trade in such a posture, that wee hope these loss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may bee repaired with advantage.</P>
<P>And so wee numbly take our leaves, having given your Worships testimony of our concordance, in the discharge of our obligations and duties, and in conformity wee subscribe, evermore resting,</P>
