<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most High and Mighty Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas every Age breeds some ex∣orbitant spirits, who turn the edge of their own sufficiency, upon what∣soever they can devour in their am∣bitious
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>apprehensions, seeking rather a great then a good fame, and holding it the chiefest honour to be thought the wonder of their Times; which if they attain unto, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but in the cordition of Monsters, that are generally much admired, but more abhorred. Friendship is of that nature, as it alwayes desires to be entertained with mutual good Offices: therefore we must not suffer it to grow cold (by being too long non-resident) for coldness is a degree of dead∣ness.</P>
<P>They that are to make Demands or Requests to their friends, must regard how the same may stand with the safety of their friends, that their motions and requests may stand with their honour and sure∣ty to accord unto it. Good purposes as well in Prin∣ces, as private men, have many hinderers; therefore, when the commodities, or discommodities of taking or refusing are once throughly weighed, a speedy resolution is the best to cut off such inconveniences that delay of time commonly bringeth.</P>
<P>MY LORDS,</P>
<P>Our desire is, That all your Counsels and Con∣sultations, may abound with abundanee of alacrity and spirit, in all your procedures, which now lie flo∣ting, in this juncture of time: Indeed, it is great wis∣dom
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>in Councellors of State to make haste leisure∣ly: State alterations are best gradual: It is less dan∣ger to anticipate occasion, then to fore slow it; And a practical point of policy, either in Prince or States, to prepare for war, when they propound for peace; by reason, That the best Treaty is with a drawn Sword; and the safest Peace is concluded under a Buckler. In a word, Necessity of fighting, doubles courage in the souldier; and an impossibility of e∣scape adds spirit to the coward: And far better it is, to build him a silver bridge to invite him to go, then Bulworks of earth to necessitate him to stay: As for Our part, upon Our return from the Diet of the Christian Princes, We shall be willing to expose Life and Fortune with You, in discussing of Your Rights and Title.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter, with the inclosed, was sent from one of the Royal Stamp, who gives out, That the States have renewed and enlarged Vantrumps Commissi∣on, to fight, kill, take, and make prize of any English Vessels whatsoever not having the K. of Scots Co∣lours. He is to ship the residue of the standing Army and 40000 are said to be listed for a Reserve.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration of the Hollanders, touching their present Engagement, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas Unity within it self felicifies, and perpetuates; so civil discord de∣molishes, and destroys the very being of a Commonwealth; that Body being in great danger that bleeds inwardly; for long setled humors give foment to the distemper when it breaks forth, and prolongs the cure when it seeks remedy: Indeed, it is a perilous weakness in a State to be slow of resolution in the time of war: To be irresolute in de∣termination, is both the sign and ruine of a weak State: such affairs attend not time: let the wise states man abhor delay, and resolve rather what to do, then what to say: slow deliberations in a quick business are symp∣toms
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>either of a faint courage, weak forces, or false hearts. And to the end, that we may declare to the World, a detestation of these Odiums, let Us endeavor to take from our Countrey all scruples that may dis-invite it to a necessity of defence: Whom the fear of slavery necessitates to fight, the boldness of their Resolution will disadvantage the Assaylants, and deficilitate their design: sense of Necessity justifies the War, and they are hopeful in their Arms which have no other hope but in their Arms. 'Tis our own case even in this juncture of time; and therefore let Us unanimously resolve to en∣ter into a firm Union and Protestation, for the defence and preservation of our liberties and freedom, and to assist each other, with the hazard of lives, fortunes, and estates, by exposing all that is near and dear unto us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n pursuance thereof: In order whereunto,
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>We the Estates and Lords Provincial of the Province of Zealand, do here send greet∣ing to all the rest of the United Provinces, To desire them with one mutual consent to rise as one man, in the defence and vindi∣cation of our National Liberties, and to be aiding and assisting, both in monies &amp; pro∣visions, out of the publike Banks, and Trea∣sure-houses, for maintenance of the Navy, raised for the defence and safety of our anci∣ent Rights, Liberties, and Customs.</P>
