The same bounty of Summer, the same milde re∣mission of Winter, with a more virgin and unexhausted soyle being materiall arguments to shew that modesty and truth receive no di∣minution by the comparison.</P>
<P>Nor is the present wildnesse of it without a particular beauty, be∣ing all over a naturall Grove of Oakes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pines, Cedars, Cipresse, Mul∣berry, Chestnut, Laurell, Sassafras, Cherry, Plum-trees, and Vines, all of so delectable an aspect, that the melanchollyest eye in the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld cannot looke upon it without contentment, nor content himsefe without admiration.

<P>Nor is the Land any lesse provided of native Flesh, Elkes bigger then Oxen, whose hide is admirable Buffe, flesh excellent, and may be made, if kept domesticke, as usefull for draught and carriage, as Oxen Deere in a numerous abundance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and delicate Venison, Ra∣coones<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hares, Conyes, Bevers, Squirrell, Beares, all of a delightfull nourishment for food<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and their Furres rich, warme, and convenient for clothing and Merchandise.</P>
<P>That no part of this happy Country may bee ungratefull to the Industrious, The ayre it selfe is often clouded with flights of Pige∣ons, Partridges, Blackbirds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thrushes, Dottrels, Cranes, Hernes, Swans, Geese, Brants, Duckes, Widgeons, Oxeyes, infinites of wilde Turkeyes, which have beene knowne to weigh fifty pound weight, ordinarily forty.</P>
<P>And the native Corne of the Country Maiz, is so gratefull to the Planter, that it returneth him his entrusted seed with the increase of 2 or 3 hundred interest, so facilely planted, that one man in 48 hours may prepare as much ground, and set such a quantity of Corne, that he may be secure from want of Bread all the yeere following, though he should have never so large an appetite to consume it, and have nothing else to live upon. Nor is it above three, or at the most foure months intervall betwixt the time of planting and gathering: Plan∣ted in March, April, or May, it is ready for the Barne in June, July, and August; and of this by a provident management, you may have yeerely three or foure Harvests. The stalk bruised yields a juice as big as Rice, pleasant as Sugar, and the green Ears boyled in such juice is comparable in agreeablenesse to the palats to what ever our Pease, Sparagus, or Hartichoke, hath eyther for satisfaction or delicacy. Nor is the Corne difficult in preservation, for in six or seven yeares there is scarce any sensibility of its corruption.</P>
<P>But lest our palats should have so much of curiosity as to dislike what ever is not native to our owne Country, and wheat is justly e∣steemed
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
more proper this happy soyle, though at the first too rich to receive it, after it hath contributed to your wealth by diminution of its owne richnesse, in three or foure crops of Rice, Flax, Indian Corne, Coleseed, or Rapeseed, will receive the English wheat with a gratefull retribution of thirty for one increase, every Acre sowed with wheat will produce six, seven, or eight Quarter of the graine intrusted. And though Mr. <HI>Bullocke</HI> be pleased to under-ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at it halfe the crowne the bushell, which in the Canaries will yeeld ten and twelve shillings, and in Spaine eight, yet even in that proporti∣on you are recompenced with six, seven, or eight pound the Acre, of which two men by a discreet division of their time, will plow, reape, and in at the least 60 Acres.</P>
<P>Which though it may appeare a matter of admiration, yet I shall easily make it apparant by the following Narration, in which such is the exactnesse of the Ayre in this Country, that you may have five successive Harvests of the same grain in different seasons. For though a man and a boy with much ease may plow an Acre every day, the ground being pliable of a rich blacke and tender mold, and no frost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or snowes, no usuall droughts or raines to hinder the going of the plow, yet I shall allow a month for the plowing of twelve Acres, and thus plowing in September, October, November, December<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and January, you may have your severall Harvests in June, July, Au∣gust, and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptember, which may easily bee inned by the same hands the labour not falling in a glut upon them, but the Corne ripening according to its severall seasons.</P>
<P>And thus by two mens labours onely you have a gratefull re∣turne of at the least three hundred and sixty Quarters of Wheat, which will at that under rate formerly mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> 2s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6d. yeeld so many pounds sterling: Nor is there such difficulty in the threshing, as may be at first sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t suspected, since it may easily be tread out with Oxen, as it is usuall in Italy and other Countries.</P>
<P>The first Wheat being reaped, if you desire a croppe of Barley, the same L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd plowed in <HI>Iuly,</HI> will returne its ripe increase in <HI>September,</HI> so that from one and the same piece of ground you may have the benefit of two different Harv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts.</P>
<P>But the Rice (for production of which this Countrey is no lesse proper then those Lands which have the greatest reputation of fer∣tility) sowed, yeelds a greater encrease with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same labour 40 A∣cres

<P>The objection, that the Countrey is overgrowne with Woods, and consequently not in many Yeares to bee penetrable for the Plough, carries a great feeblenesse with it. For there are an im∣mense quantity of Indian fields cleared already to our hand by the Natives, which till wee grow over populous may every way be a∣bundantly sufficient, but that the very clearing of ground carries an extraordinary benefit with it, I wil make apparent by these follow∣ing Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. If wee consider the benefit of Pot-ashes growne from ten to fifty pound the Tunne, within these twenty yeares, and in all proba∣bility likely to encrease by reason of interdicting Trade betwixt us and the Muscovite, from whence we used to supply our selves; We shall finde the employment of that very Staple will raise a conside∣rable summe of Money, and no man so imployed can (if industri∣ous) make his labour lesse then one hundred pound, <HI>per annum</HI>: For if wee consider that those who labour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout this in England give twelve pence the bushell for Ashes, if wee consider to how many severall parts of the Countrey they are compelled to send man and horse before they can procure any qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntity to fall to worke u∣pon; if wee consider some of the thriftiest, and wise, and under∣standing men, fell Wood on purpose for this Commodity, and yet notwithstanding this Brigade of difficulties finde their Adventures and Labours answered with a large returne of profit, wee who have all these things, already at our owne doore without cost, may with a confidence grounded upon reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expect an advantage much grea∣ter, and a clearer profit.</P>
<P>Nor can wee admit in discretion, that a large quantity of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould not finde a speedy Market, since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he decay of Tymber is a de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect growne universall in Europe, and the Commodity such a neces∣sary Staple, that no civill Nation can be conveniently without it.</P>
<P>Nor are Pipe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taves and Clapboard a despicable commodity, of which one man may with ease make fifteene thousand yearely, which in the countrey it selfe are sold for 4l. in the <HI>Canaries</HI> for
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
twenty pound the thousand, and by this meanes the labour of one man will yeeld him 60l. <HI>per annum,</HI> at the lowest Market. If all this be not sufficient to remove the incumbrance of Woods, the Saw mill may be taken into consideration, which is in every respect highly beneficiall by this Timber for building houses, and shipping may be more speedily prepared, and in greater quantity by the la∣bour of two or three men, then by a hundred hands after the usuall manner of sawing.</P>
<P>The Plankes of Walnut-trees for Tables or Cubbords, Cedar and Cypresse, for Chests, Cabinets, and the adorning magnificent buil∣dings, thus prepared will be easily transported into England, and sold at a very considerable value.</P>
<P>But that in which there will be an extraordinary use of our Woods is the Iron mills, which if once erected will be an unde∣caying Staple, and of this forty servants will by their labour raise to the Adventurer foure thousand pound yearely: Which may ea∣sily be apprehended if wee consider the deerenesse of Wood in En∣gland, where notwithstanding this great clog of difficulty, the Master of the Mill gaines so much yearely, that he cannot but reckon himselfe a provident Saver.</P>
<P>Neither does <HI>Virginia</HI> yeeld to any other Province whatsoever in excellency and plenty of this Oare: And I cannot promise to my selfe any other then extraordinary successe and gaine, if this noble and usefull Staple be but vigourously followed.</P>
<P>And indeed it had long ere this growne to a full perfection, if the treachery of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndians had not crushed it in the beginning, and the backwardnesse of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants to reerect i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, hindred that Countrey from the benefit arising from that universall Staple.</P>
<P>But to shew something further, what use may be made of Woods besides the forementioned Wallnut Oyle, at the least a fourth part of the Trees in <HI>Virginia</HI> being of that <HI>species,</HI> is an excellent Staple, and very gainefull to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e industrious Labourer.</P>
<P>Nor is it a contemptible profit that may be made of Woods, if by boaring holes in divers trees, of whose vertues wee are yet ig∣norant, and collecting the juce thereof, a scrutiny be made which are fit for Medicinall Liquor and Balsomes; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Gummes, Perfumes, and Dyes, and heere I may justly take occasion to com∣plaine of our owne sloth and indulgence, if compared to the labo∣rious

Nor are the many Berries commonly of an excellent collour and lustre unfit for such experiments; since the labour is little or nothing, and the issue if succesfull of remarkable advantage. And this the Spanyard hath experimented to the encrease of gaine and reputation; and above this is so signally curious and industrious, that he hath discovered many rare and delightfull colours, not onely by the meanes before mentioned, but by bruizing and boyling divers Fish-shells, the brightnesse and variety of colours giving him a just reason to pur∣sue such curious examens.</P>
<P>The French relations of their Voyages to <HI>Canada,</HI> tell us, that the Indians and themselves falling into a contagious disease, of which Phisitians could give no Reason or Remedy, they were all in a short space restored to their health meerely by drinking water, in which Saxifrage was infused and boyld, which was then discovered to them by the Natives, and wee justly entertaine beliefe that many excellent Medicines either for conservation of Nature in her vigour or restauration in her decadence may be communicated unto us, if projection of this stampe be so much incouraged by hopes of re∣ward or honour, as to be put in practice.</P>
<P>By this Improvement of Woods, the Ground comming to bee cleared, wee have a soile fit to produce what ever is excellent in Na∣ture, the Vine and Olive which Naturally simpathize together, will thrive beyond beliefe, nor need it be any interruption to Tillage, since the Vintage and Harvest alwayes fall but in different Reasons.</P>

if wee set the Greeke Cyprian Candian or Calabrian Grape, those Countries lying parallell with this, there neede not be made the smallest question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but it would be a Staple which would enrich this Countrey to the envy of France and Spaine, and furnish the Nor∣therne parts of Europe, and China it selfe where they plant it not, (of which more heereafter) with the Noblest Wine in the World, and at no excessive prices.</P>
<P>And from this Staple 'tis not unworthy of our most serious con∣sideration, what an occasion of wealth would flow upon this Nati∣on: Virginia when well peopled being able to match Spaine in that his Soveraigne Revenue, and the State by addition to their Customes for exportation thereof according to the mode of France and Spaine, would in no short time be sensible of this most inesti∣mable benefit: To which if wee joyne the Profits of our Olives, wee may (Gods favourable hand blessing our industry) be the hap∣piest Nation in Europe.</P>
<P>Nor need wee be at that charge for Caske under which Spaine labours, where ever wee cast our eyes upon this Fortunate Countrey wee may finde Timber proper for it.</P>
<P>For the advance of which noble Staple, I should propose that the Greeke, and other Rich Vines, being procured from the Countries to which they are geniall, every Planter in that Coun∣trey might be enjoyned to keepe a constant Nursery, to the end when the ground is cleared, that they may be fit for removal, and the Vineyard speedily planted.</P>
<P>Further that some Greeke, and other Vignerous might be hired out of those Countries to instruct us in the labour, and lest their en∣vy, pride, or jealousie of being layd aside when their mysterie is discovered, may make them too reserved in communicating their knowledge, they may be assured, besides the continuance of their Pension of a share in the profits of every mans Vintage, which will the more easily perswade them to be liberall and faithfull in their instructions, since the publick advance of this designe cannot mis∣carry without a sensible losse to their particular interest.</P>
<P>That before their going over a generall consultation may be had whith them what ground is proper, what season fit, what pre∣vention of casualties by bleeding or splitting, what way to pre∣serve or restore Wine when vesseld, which <HI>species</HI> of Wine is fittest
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
for transportation over, or retention in the Countrey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which for duration, which for present spending: It being in experience mani∣fest that some Wines refine themselves by purge upon the Sea, o∣thers by the same meanes suffer an evaporation of their Spirits, joyne to this that some Wines collect strength and richnesse, others contract feeblenesse and sowernesse by seniority.</P>
<P>These consultations drawne to a head by some able person, and published to be sent over in severall Copies to Virginia, by the in∣spection of which people might arrive at such competent know∣ledge in the Mystery, that the reservation or jealousies of those Vig∣nerons, could not but be presently perceived and prevented.</P>
<P>But from hence no occasion should bee derived to breake or fall short of any contract made with those Vignerons, who are to be e∣xactly dealt with in performance of Articles, every way made good unto them, with all just respects to win upon them, and the non∣performance of this hath beene the originall cause why Virginia at this day doeth not abound with that excellent commodity. Those contracted with as hired servants for that imployment, by what miscariage I know not, having promise broken with them, and com∣pelled to labour in the quality of Slaves, could not but expresse their resentment of it, and had a good colour of justice to conceale their knowledge, in recompence of the hard measure offered them, which occasioned the laying aside of that noble Staple, the diligent prose∣cution whereof, had by this time brought Virginia to an absolute perfection in it, and to a great degree of happinesse and wealth which would attend it.</P>
<P>And had this beene as happily followed as it was prudently in∣tended<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that excellent Country had not hung downe its desolate head in so languishing a condition as the disrespect cast upon her, till of late yeares had reduced her to. Nor had the poore Planter (who usually spends all the profits of his labour in forraigne Wines) been impoverished by the want of it: but with delight might have sha∣ded himselfe under his vine, reaped the benefit of it in Autumne, and buried all the memory and sense of his past labours in a cheerfull re∣joycing by his owne harth with the issue of his owne vineyard.</P>

<P>All Authors of Agriculture unanimously consent that neither Arable Pasture, Meadow, or any other Grounds are so benigne ge∣nuine, or proper for planting Vines in, as those cleared Lands are, wherein not Shrubs, but Tall Trees were standing.

<HEAD><HI>VIRGINIA</HI> compared to <HI>CHINA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt to leave Persia and descend to a more wealthy and powerful parallell, the richest and mightiest Empire in the World lies in the same latitude and climate with our fortunate Virginia; namely China, divided from it onely by the Southsea, and (which will bee a part of another discourse) not of any long distance from it, agreeing with it in multitude of Staples. China is stored with an infinite number of Mulberry trees to feede Silkewormes with, and vends silke in such a vast proportion, that in one onely City <HI>Lempo,</HI> which some call <HI>Liempo,</HI> the Portugeses, have with no small admiration, observed that one hundred and sixty thousand pound weight of silk hath beene caried out in one Shippe in the onely space of three Mo∣neths.</P>
<P>Into <HI>Cambula</HI> the chiefe City of Tartary (as Authors of great

repute and credit, and one who was personally there, reports) there comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very day from China, a thousand waggons laden with silke. Nor is China lesse happy in its multitude of navigable Rivers, in its wonderfull fertility of all sorts of graine, Maiz, Rice, &amp;c. of which it receiveth every yeere three or foure most plentifull Harvests. Ri∣vers stored with an incredible quantity of Fish and Fowle, enriched and ennobled with numerous Mines of Gold, Silver, Brasse, Iron, and other Mettalls, Quicksilver, Nitre, Allum, Pretious stones, Pearles, Muske, Cotton, Sugars, Rubarb, China Root, vast propor∣tions of Flax, Furres extraordinary rich. To this happinesse of soile and situation, they associate an equall felicity of parts and industry, by which they pretermit not one span of ground which they assign not to particular and profitable uses, and by an ingenious division of the ground according to the quality of the soyle, designe the dri∣er part for wheat and barly, That which is more visited with an im∣proving moysture, to Rice and Sugar; As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents and Mountaines to groves of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes and Chestnuts, betweene which are planted Maiz Panicle, and all kinde of Pulse. In other proper places are Mulber∣ry Groves, Gardens, Orchards, Flax, and in a word no spot of ground misimployed from its proper advantage.</P>
<P>And that Virginia is parallell in neerenesse of Staples, as well as neighbourhood to the sunne, to that celebrated Empire, what mul∣titudes of Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to satisfie the most voluptuous of wishes, can China glory in which Virginia may not in justice boast of?

What Fleets come yeerely upon the coasts of New found Land, and New England for Fish, with an incredible re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rne? Yet tis a most assu∣red truth, that if they would make experiment upon the South of Cape Cod, and from thence to the coast of this happy Countrey, they would find Fish of a greater delicacy, and as full handed plen∣ty, which though Foraigners know not, yet if our owne Planters would make use of it, would yield them a Revenue which cannot admit of any diminution, whilest there are Ebbes and Flouds, Ri∣vers feed and receive the Ocean, or Nature fayles in (the Elementall Originall of all things) Waters.</P>
<P>There wants nothing but industrious spirits and incouragement, to make a rich Staple of this commodity; and would the Virgini∣ans but make Salt pits, in which they have a greater convenience of Tides (that part of the Universe by reason of a full influence of the Moone upon the almost limitlesse Atlantick causing the most spacious Fluxes and Refluxes, that any shore of the other divisions in the World is sensible of) to leave their pits full of Salt∣water, and more friendly and warme Sunbeames to concoct it into Salt, then Rochel, or any parts of Europe. Yet notwithstanding these advantages which prefer Virginia before Rochel, the French King rayses a large proportion of his Revenues out of that Staple yearly, with which he supplyes a great part of Christendome.</P>
<P>And if from this Staple the miserable French can procure a sub∣sistence, some of them a comfortable livelyhood, notwithstanding all the private oppressions of their grinding Landlords, the Publick Tallies, Subsidies, Aides, Imposts, and other hard Titles of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thori∣zed Rapine. What shall wee imagine the freeborne English in a Countrey where he owes no Rent to any but to God and Nature, where he has Land to satisfie his desires in its extent, his wishes in its fertility, where free-quarter is a word onely un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erstood by Re∣port, may expect of profit and content both in this Staple of Salt, in that of Wines made in those Countries, where either the Spa∣nish insolence and exactions, the French extortions, or the Turkish Imperiall Robberi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, though in the highest degrees of exorbitance,

are not of force so to disincourage the Inhabitants from attendance upon the Vineyard, which notwithstanding all those Horse-leaches of Imposition, returnes them such a profit a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make them keepe a middle path betweene the ascent of Riches, and precipice of Pover∣ty.</P>
<P>Nor would it be such a long intervall (Salt being first made) be∣twixt the undertaking of this Fishing, and the bringing it to per∣fection; for if every servant were enjoyned to practise Rowing, to be taught to handle Sailes, and trimme a Vessell, a worke easily pra∣ctised, and suddainely learned, the pleasantnesse of Weather in fish∣ing season, the delicacy of the Fish, of which they usually feede themselves with the best, the encouragement of some share in the profit, and their understanding what their owne benefit may bee when their freedome gives them an equallity, will make them wil∣ling and able Fisher-men and Seamen.</P>
<P>To adde further to this, if wee consider the abundance, largenesse, and peculiar excellency o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgeon in that Countrey, it will not fall into the least of scruples, but that one <HI>species</HI> will bee of an invaluable profit to the buyer, or if wee repeate to our thoughts the singular plenty of Herrings and Mackarell, in goodnesse and great∣nesse much exceeding what ever of that kinde these our Seas pro∣duce, a very ordinary unders<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anding may at the first inspection per∣ceive that it will be no great difficulty to out-labour and out-vye the Hollander in that his almost onely Staple: Which wee may also sell at a cheaper Market then in common estimation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if wee revolve the Salt to be our owne, which they buy from France, or fetch from the Isle of May, and that the very fraight of Passengers (of which allured by this improvement, and the publick approbation, there will be constant multitudes) in our owne Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppes will at the least defray 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fourths of the charges.</P>
<P>I should not unwillingly heare (though I dispaire ever to know it for a certainety) that <HI>China</HI> did exceede us in fishing; for were it granted, wee should not imagine those watry Inhabitants so cir∣cumscribed and limited to one part of the Ocean especially the same Climate and Latitude, inviting them as not to visit our opposite shore of Southwest <HI>Virginia</HI> in as great variety and plenty.</P>
<P>And to the more curious and able Persons I shall offer what singu∣lar object it were of variety and plenty, if they would take the ad∣vantage

From a thing almo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t lost to memory, (at the least to reputation) they have raysed the honour of that Island, to be a subject of admiration for wealth and Staple, and that so little a cir∣cumference of Ground should be able to vent the value of two hun∣dred and fifty thousand pound yeerely, as some Merchants have maintayned, not only addes to the weight and measure of their just estimation, but increases the favourable wishes of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overs of indu∣stry, that they had a larger proportion of ground to improve upon.</P>
<P>And if an invincible sloth doth not possesse us in Virginia, (wee meane the South) why should not wee rayse an equall or greater profit upon as fertile and convenient a soile? especially if we consider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he populousnesse of the place, has so raysed the price of Land there, which we have heere gratis, where number of inhabitants doe so little take from our abundance, that they adde to our wealth, securi∣ty and plenty, and the sole meanes to increase and improve upon Staples.</P>
<P>We have made it apparant that what ever China hath of Staple or delicacy, is produced or producible in this above-example Virgin.

<P>Nor is Tobacco in those Indian seas (especially cured as in Virgi∣nia, and of that strength and excellency) a commodity of inconside∣rable commerce, particularly if wee call to minde what gayne there is by the exchange for Indian commodities, so that any ordinary un∣derstanding may comprehend that although Tobacco should yeeld but three pence the pound in India, yet by way of barter with those Nations where the returne quadruples the value in England, the gaynes gotten by it might be very considerable.</P>
<P>But if we may beleeve Printed Relations (and the person delive∣ring it so cleerely, is, in my opinion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy of all credit) Tobacco from Surat to Moco yeeld ten for one profit, returned in Eastridge feathers to England, you have six to one profit; but this is for those Planters who are so infected with that disease of the Countrey, that they cannot admit of any other Staple, though more gainefull and lesse laborious.

<P>It will not be denied by any, whose forehead is not too brazen, that no Countrey is so proper for adventitions as its owne Native Commodities, the seeds of things suffer a deterioration by changing the propriety of that soile which was geniall to them, and the ex∣act order of Nature suffers a diminution, if wee imagine any other Climate or Region more proper for the perfection of any thing, then where it is originally produced.</P>
<P><HI>Tellier</HI> aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmes that this mystery of the Silke-worme hath not been experimented in Europe above a thousand yeares<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being trans∣mitted to our Climate out of the Asiatick World, in so much that Italy hath not beene above 200 yeares enriched with this industri∣ous Creature, France received it from Italy, and it is observed, that the warmer the Region, by so much larger and stronger encrease and texture receive they from the labour of this admirable and na∣turall Weaver.

<P>The poore people in both those Kingdomes buy their Mulberry leaves to feede this profitable and ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strious Spinner, and the very charge of those leaves amounts to a full halfe of all other their ex∣pences.</P>

<P>Yet divers Gentlemen in Italy make a larger increase of profit, by setting out their Mulberry trees to necessito<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s people, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the gaine arising from the worme so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d.

<P>And the same <HI>Tellier</HI> is bold to affirme, that <HI>non obstante</HI> the disa∣greeablenesse of the Country to that worme, in the Kingdome of France from the sole revenue now of Silke, arises a greater intrade then from their Corne, Oyle and Woad put together, which grow in that Kingdome in vast proportions. And another French Author affirmeth, that the benefit of the Silke worme, (of which France hath had no triall till within these fifty yeeres) ariseth to four Milli∣ons <HI>per annum,</HI> sterling, and this he pretends to have all circumstan∣ces of truth and certainty, drawne from an exact computation to confirme it.</P>
<P>If France (an almost improper Countrey for this improvement) can rayse within the verge of fifty yeeres, so large and numerous a revenue, what shall we imagine Italy (a warmer Region, and by much more convenient, although not altogether Native, for this in∣riching creature) may meerely upon this Staple returne in their Treasury, having besides the advantage of Climate, a hundred and fifty yeeres precedency in the mystery, and their seed more strong, better fed, and lesse subject to diseases and casualties?</P>
<P>But Virginia a Countrey which Nature hath no lesse particularly assigned for the production, food, and perfection of this Creature then Persia or China, stored naturally with infinites of Mul∣berry-trees, some so large that the leaves thereof have by French∣men beene esteemed worth 5l. in which the indigenall and naturall Worme hath beene found as bigge as Wallnuts; and the using in the South thereof in admirable plenty and excellence; if this mystery were but duly followed, and industriously promoved, might be a Magazine for all the Westerne World, and singly in her selfe out∣vy France, Spaine, and Italy, in all their advantages collected.</P>
<P>Heere the Leaves are onely sold by nature, who requires no other satisfaction then industry to make use of her bounty. Timber to e∣rect their Fabricks is provided, and costs no more then preparing a benevolent Sunne, and a Serene Sky, contributing their indulgence to its perfection. No narrow assignation of Ground (richer then

the most fertile France or Italy can pretend to, or boast of) to plant those Trees on, if not neare enough to the setled Plantations; in briefe, all the conveniences imaginable to assist and advance this to the Noblest Commerce in the World, if neglect and sloth make us not ingratefull to our selves, and nature, by abusing our selves, by not using her bounty.</P>
<P>To further this happy designe, let us descend into an unequall comparison: Let us compare our most incomparable Virginia, where the Mulberry and the Worme are aboriginall to Italy, where they are onely adventitious: Let us imagine our owne Worme of that strength and greatnesse onely equall to those of Brescia and I∣taly, where the usuall ofcome from sixe ounces of seede is 72, ot at least 60 pound weight of Silke, and adhearing to this Parallell; let us see the apparency in the profit.</P>
<P>A man and a boy, if their hands be not sleeping in their pockets, will feede as many Wormes as come of sixe or eight ounces of seed till they be past their foure first sicknesses, and within some 14 dayes of spinning: Indeed the last 14 dayes require a more extraordinary diligence and attendance, a more frequent and carefull feeding, be∣cause in that time they conceive, gather, and store up the disposing matter from whence the Silke comes, which by an incomprehensi∣ble mystery of Nature, they after as it were vomit out of their mouthes, and spinne out of their bowells. At this more particu∣lar season, there is a necessity of adding the labour of three or foure helpes more (to which Women or Children are as proper as Men) which is an inconsiderable accession considering the gaine arising from it.</P>
<P>That you may know the reason why Women, Children, lame and impotent persons are as fitting to attend the last fourteene dayes, as Men, will appeare by their labour, which is nothing but to feede them within doores, cleanse, dry, and perfume their lodgings, with some strengthning but not overstrong odour.</P>
<P>And as one skilfull in this noble mystery is sufficient for the em∣ploying, overseeing, and directing hundreds under him, so (the skill being rather experimentally to be taught, then built upon long and ambiguous precepts) he may bee able to perfect all those under him within the five or six weeekes time of their imployment in the full understanding the mystery. And the better to incourage both
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
the teacher and learner of the mystery, the master should be invited by reward to be liberall in communicating his knowledge, and those under his instruction encouraged by arguments of honour and profit proposed to the best proficient, would disperse seeds of emulation and diligence, since every one would imploy himselfe seriously to engrosse and appropriate to himselfe the reputation and advantage in the victory.</P>
<P>And in boyes and children, disputations frequently set on foot, with some slight distinction of merit, would make all that are inge∣niously disposed, quicken their observation and diligence, to gaine the credit of prelation. Though to take off all disincouragement or despayre, from those lesse apprehensive and docible, in this noble and gainefull Trade of Silke, there is no such absolute necessity layd upon them to be supersticiously and precisely curious in observing the Booke Rules, and written Precepts, that upon the omission or unpunctuall observation of any of those Precepts in hatching, lod∣ging, feeding, and tending of the Silke-wormes, wee should ima∣gine such minute deviations might occasion an improsperity or gene∣rall failing: for wee will admit something may be wanting either in materialls, accommodation, or precisenesse of knowledge; yet may the worke (a higher and irresistible cause not interrupting it) prosper and succeede, notwithstanding such defect, to the great con∣tentment and gaine of them which keepe them.</P>
<P>Let us imagine it to be granted that the indigency of the person improving the incommodiousnesse of the place, or want of House∣roome, which the Bookes exactly tye us to, be in many things pre∣terregular (though such a supposition may fall upon any other part of the World more justly then Virginia, where all materialls and convenien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y answer our exactest wishes) yet will dayly examples confirme us, that in Languedoc, Provence, and other parts of France, and as many in Spaine and Italy, amongst the common sort of that exaction tyred people, that one poore low-rooft Cottage, and one Roome in it is all the house extent they have to take their sleepe in, dresse their miserable dyet, and serve themselves of for use and re∣tirement; yet does this industrious Creature (such are the blessings with which God rewards the sweat of Industry) thrive as happily (and sometimes answer labour with a greater felicity) as those which the curiosity of Richer persons fit with all commodiousnesse

of Chamber feeding, and attending, which is a speaking encou∣ragement that no man should despaire, but reposing a cheerefull confidence in the blessing of the Almighty, with this R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solution, that what ever mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, what ever curiosity, art, or precept, may contribute towards the preparing and facilitation of a worke, yet the end, the event must depend on his eternall goodnesse to crowne it, and all our labours projected with never so great a Talent of humane wisdome and experience, must conclude with this never fai∣ling truth: That except the Lord build the house their labour is but lost that build it: Except the Lord keepe the City, the Watch∣man watches but in vaine. Wee must therefore lift up our hearts and eyes with thankefullnesse u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the Hills, unto the Mountaine of Israel, and Rock of <HI>David,</HI> from whence those streames of blessings must acknowledge their sole, their originall Fountaine, which may serve as an admonition, that neither the whole, nor any part of the work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be begunne without applying our devotions to him: Let it therefore be the Morning Omen to the worke, and the Eve∣ning auspice, Lord prosper the worke of our hands, prosper g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord our handy workes. After the Reposall of this confidence in God; let him apply himselfe with his greatest industry and ability, with this comfort and assurance, that he cannot but make a conside∣rable returne: Though wee should be much injurious to Art (the noble right hand and Midwife to Nature) if wee should deny a more promising probability of a riper and fuller gaine the more cu∣rious and observant he is in following all the approved experiments, Rules, directions, and precepts thereunto belonging.</P>
<P>But the chiefest aime and intention of those Rules are to illustrate the perfection of this Art, and to informe your knowledge, and bet∣ter your future experience and preventionall care, if any misadven∣ture arrive, or miscarriage in the Silke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wormes, or if they prosper not equally this yeare with the last; for by inspection upon them you may understand the cause and reason of such misadventure, and with it the remedy; and this also takes away all dispaire or disin∣couragement for men, commonly men till they are convinced in the naturall ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of a disaster or failing attribute, all such mischances to Nature, or else impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the non-thriving to their owne misfortune by a ridiculous opinion that they are not ordained to be fortunate in this or that Mystery, so freequently does Fortune incurre the blame
<PB N="35" REF="23"/>
of humane neglect or ignorance.</P>
<P>Besides wee are to imprint in our knowledge, that no Rules can have so much of generality and exactnesse, which will not admit of deviations arising from some particular and variable circumstances. Wee must not therefore conforme the nature of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imate to our Rules, but our Rules to it, in which wee must resume to your deli∣beration how, and in what one Climate differs from another, how the constitution of this yeare varie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the next, or the precedent, the immediocrities of heate, cold, drought, and moisture, serenity, or mists, &amp;c. The manner of their lodgings, the quality of the winde to be admitted or excluded: To temper a season inclining to a preternaturall coolenesse with an artificiall heate, to refresh and infrigidate the Aire in times of immoderate heate, by admitting the cooling Aire and Windes proceeding from a cooler Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arter, and this to be observed with a more particular care; when they spinne their Silke, that Creature then being very obnoxious to be stifled with too much heat.</P>
<P>There must be likewise a providentiall regard in a moist season, that the Mulberry leaves be carefully dryed after their gathering, before they be administred for food to the Silke-worme: But if the season pertake more of drought it will be wisedome to let the leaves lye and shade a little after their gathering, that they may have them coole and refreshing, and in seasons of temperature and con∣tinued droughts, it may be very requisite to water the Roots of the Mulberry-tree, which will be a refreshing to the leaves, and this is usually practised in Spaine; especially if the Mulberry-tree be sea∣ted in a hot or dry ground, which otherwise must not be so prescri∣bed without particular caution.</P>
<P>Nor is it below our consideration to weigh the condition of the place in which the Mulberry is planted, if in a sower foule or wet soile to collect what inconvenience that food may bring unto your worme, and therefore if your necessity will admit it to avoyd such wholly, if not to use them with such qualifications as may make them least offensive.</P>
<P>After having regard to the nature of the ground your Tree re∣ceives its juce from, the quality of the season, in which you gather them; it falls next to your consideration to compare the kinde and nature of the Tree, together with the kinde and nature of their
<PB N="28" REF="24"/>
seed, worme, and silke, and directing your selfe by an exact obser∣vation of particular circumstances, so to make exceptions, and to or∣der every thing with judgement and discretion thereafter, that your Bookes and experience may by that meanes walke hand in hand to∣gether.</P>
<P>But time and observations will affoord you many experiments, out of which perhaps some more rules of Art may be framed, in di∣vers particulars, more consenting to the Country and Climate of Virginia. Which finding, after good triall thereupon made, it will become the reputation of a good Patriot in generall, and a good Ma∣ster of a family in particular, to digest them into such a regular or∣der and method, that the publication thereof may be a common be∣nefit to all, and a private memoriall to particulars.</P>
<P>For since in Persia and China it does not fall under likelihood, that they can oblige themselves to observe all particulars in its stri∣ctest limitation, where such an infinite quantity of silke passeth through the hands of the people, it is very agreeable to reason that in a Climate of the same nature and parallell, namely Virginia, there may be rules found out of far l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse brevity, and more pertinency, then have yet been considered or published.</P>
<P>And yet where all these Rules are curiously observed, they make not onely in Spaine and Italy, but in the colder parts of France a far greater gaine (the quantity of adventure and time considered) by thus chargeably feeding of Silk-wormes, then by any other com∣modity whatsoever.</P>
<P>But to avoid that inconvenience of fetching leaves a far off, or attending the growth of your owne Mulberries, or that necessity which makes the poorer sort of our owne miserable people to lodge them in that Roome which is their Kitchin, their Chamber, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir all. With what ease and conveniency may there be a house set up in the middle of a Grove of Mulberries, naturally growing, where the Silkewormes, in a dry Cabinet of Boords, after the maner of Sicily, may be kept (described more largely in the Bookes which treat of this Silkeworme, then can bee expected in this paper) set up with stones in it, in case the Countrey and season require it, eyther to cor∣rect the ill sents, or (if so be they are seated in cold, moyst, or shady plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, of which your owne sense and experience will quickly ac∣quaint yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) to give the ayre a temper and qualification, which if not
<PB N="29" REF="24"/>
prevented, may destroy your worke by killing the Silkeworme.</P>
<P>And this Lodge built for them, the season of the yeere will in∣vite your selfe and family (I meane such part of your family as you assigne to this worke) to lodge there also, the time being at the most but six weekes, and for the first moneth, one third of your fa∣mily will be sufficient to feed them, but the last 14. dayes; the o∣ther 2. thirds will be requisit that the wormes may bee more often and plentifully fed the well feeding at that time contributing much to their strength and perfection, and consequently to the improving your expected silke, both in quantity and quality.</P>
<P>That all may be invited and courted to this undertaking, in this glorious Countrey, N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture hath left us destitute of no materialls. To erect these slight silken lodgings, will be no more expences, then your labour; nor is that any greater, then to cut out some posts and studdes, fit them, and set them up, then to cleave and saw out small quarters, rafters, plankes, pales, and boards, to make and set up the sides of the house, in stead of more substantiall walls, and to cover the roofe in stead of Tile. For the effecting of all which with the lesser trouble, that Countrey affords abundance of Woods, which will runne out, slit, and cleave into long lengths and br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adths, which by the directnesse of the Ground will rive in a manner, as if they had beene sawen for the worke. All which must be so close layd, joyned, and nayled together, the one still lapt over the other, that no Winde or Raine may penetrate therein to offend that labo¦rious Creature, and this may easily be prevented, if such chinkes and open places as you shall discover bee stopped up with Lome, Clay, and Lime, of which materialls in those Countreyes you will finde no want. And to this purpose the Indian Mats, and the like things may be made good use of in this way, which will be sure to keepe out Winde and perhaps Raine: But to these things your owne inventions, <HI>pro re nata,</HI> will abundantly furnish you with matter of preventing casualties: Nor will it bee unseasonable to repeat the extraordinary convenience of Saw-mills, which in this case will be in a high degree serviceable to you, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his the whole Colony will be beneficially sensible in boards, Plankes, hou∣sing, Silk-worm-lodgings, Timber, shipping, and all particular kinde of uses.</P>
<P>And this once erected, with what speed may such a house be clap∣ped
<PB N="39" REF="25"/>

<P>Or being in doubt of surprisall, some Families going into the Woods together may equally joyne together, and those woodden houses (still observing that the Roomes where the wormes are may be set end and end together, that so the Kitchins and their lodgings may be still the two extreames) may be cast into the forme of a Fort which pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sadoed, and your house sentinelled by halfe a dozen of good Dogges, wilbe a sufficient defence against all the Natives of the Countrey.</P>
<P>And this may be in case they worke not in common, which if by compact they agree upon, the Lodging for the wormes may be cast in the middle of such a circle, the Timber houses round about sha∣ding them from over much heat, wind or moisture, and the necessary fires there made, will throughly cleere the ayre of all vapours and mists which may disorder this innocent Spinner. The Silke Har∣vest ready, and the encrease brought to a just estimation: The Co∣habitors may according to the agreement made betwixt them, re∣turne with their Dividends, and this removall into the Woods will have the same nature of content which the Citizens take in a time of vacation and City wearinesse (Citizens being never so weary as when they have no worke) to visit the delights of the Countrey, though with different ends; since these in their Voyages of plea∣sure expend, the other both save and encrease their stock and trea∣sure. These Boards (the worke ended) being taken downe are ser∣viceable for seaven yeares together, and easily erected or renewed.</P>
<P>I am not altogether of advice, that the Indians be hired to assist you in these Remoter Workes, as sensible how apt they and the Divell t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Tutor may be to embrace an occasion of being treache∣rous; but if they could be brought to worke by Parties (well watched and Spyes amongst themselves set over them) in the mid∣dest of our most populous Plantations, with their Wives and Chil∣dren, who will easily runne through this curious, but not heavy la∣bour, and may be sufficient pawnes for the Indian fidelity, if cun∣ningly divided, they would be very serviceable in this kinde for a small Reward, and peradventure might be made great use of for
<PB N="38" REF="25"/>
this worke heereafter by undertaking it themselves, which may be manifested for these Reasons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. First, the Indian is naturally curious and very ingenious, which they shew in all their works and imitations: the only thing that frights them from bringing any work to perfection, is the la∣bour attending it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But to feed his curiosity, there is nothing in the world more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then this cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious atome of Nature the Silkeworme: to see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>taught Artist spin out his transparent bowels, labour such a monument out of his owne intralls, as may be the shame, the blush of Artists, such a Robe that Solomon in all his glory might con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esse the meannesse of his apparell, in relation to the workemen, cannot but bring them to admiration; and that thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s whose t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oughts are of a higher wing then ordinary, may bee convinced of a divine power of the hand of God in the Creation: which gaynd upon him, it will not be impossible to drive him to an acknowledgement of Redemption, if private ends or any other respect then that to Gods glory, possesse not those who should cover a multitude of sinnes, by winning a soule to his Creator, and forcing him from the jawes of his Destroyer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In this curiosity there is little or no labour (a thing which they abhorre) their women and children will bee sufficient to goe through with it: and if they could but be brought to it, our Trade with them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r silke would be of greater consequence, then all their Furs or other commodities put together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By this meanes it were possible to fasten Clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hs upon them, which if once it were effected, that which Mr. <HI>Bullocke</HI> excellent patly calls, The Universall not of Nature, Ambition would cement them to a more orderly course of life, and one still striving to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vie the other in bravery of habits: there would be no labour under Hea∣ven like this, to reduce them to civility, the toyle thereof being in∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsiderable, and the profit great to him in respect of his now tri∣fling Merchandise: and to us by trading with them, might bee re∣turned for 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. the pound at the most in commodities.</ITEM>

By this means would he be brought to plant great quantities of Mulberry trees round about his Plantation, which according to his constant inconstancy, evermore shifting, would necessarily, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wne numbers increasing, fall into our hands and possession, or if he

<ITEM>6. The Silkeworme harvest lighting at such a season of the year, wherein he by improvidence hath wasted all his Bread-corne, at which time he usually retires into the Woods to seeke a thinne s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bsistence, by the allurement of this great profit he would undo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b∣tedly stay at his Plantation, and allow us a share in his increase of Silke, for such provision of Maiz as would maintaine him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his would be a large accession of profit to the English.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>Neither doe I comprehend a sufficient Reason why in so happy a Climate as that of Virginia; there may not be a double Silke Har∣vest: This I am sure of, that there are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in Nature of retarda∣tion as well as acceleration of Springs, and both being industriously brought to the experiment, the acceleration anteceeding the first Spring, and the retardation postvening the latter by three weekes, (which may easily be effected by election and distinction of ground to plant in) and at the latter end of the Harvest the seeds being dis∣posed and ripened for production, will without doubt produce an effect answerable to the most inestimable profit intended by it.</P>
<P>That the election of Ground may doe this, wee may see by free∣quent examples betwixt things well cultivated, and that which is never transplanted from its first wildnesse, and there are many pre∣sidents round about us, where in one and the same Towne, one and the same fruit have oftentimes three Weekes distance of time be∣twixt their unequall maturity; the naturall warmenesse or coldnes of the Ground occasioning the advance or procrastination of fruits according to its severall disposition.</P>
<P>Nor can such a course be any interruption to Harvest or Vintage, both comming much after the season of the Silke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>worme, though
<PB N="33" REF="26"/>
I should (in submission to better judgement) conceive that with transplantation of trees (such as they would have come later then ordinary, for that purpose being loosed from the Ground neare upon the ascent of their sap would spring for that season ac∣cordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir expectation later then is usuall, and the next yeare its novelty of ground having made it wanton will come much ear∣lier, and more improved then those whose fixure to the place of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first pull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation keepes it selfe to its former constancy, and by this meanes the later Harvest would not be at the most three Weekes time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter the (usuall) income of the first.</P>
<P>And without doubt the Chineses and Persian could not vend such vast quantities of Silke, with which they fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shion so huge a part of the World with one single Harvest, which though wee are at present ignorant of, yet what should discourage us from delive∣ring such conjectures to a tryall, since the examen of it is not with∣out probability, nor the discovery without an extraordinary cer∣tainety of profit?</P>
<P>Those who will object that notwithstanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 years practice I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aly hath not discovered this mystery, or if discovered, found it destitute of successe, may be pleased to receive this Answer: That there is an immense disproportion betwixt the happyest Region of Italy, and the South of the excellent Virginia. Italy (and that an∣nually<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is subject much to inclemency of Winters, in respect of our more temperate Maid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, where Snows and black Swans are alike Prodigies; the cold th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is rather like a Phletomy to tame the Ple∣thorick abundance of Springs, then dead it: Nor are the Srpings of Italy so early as ours in that Climate, and the Mulberry shooting forth later then all other Trees by much, may by this meanes of transplantation and heat of soile, be equall with the first, and by that early apparence give day-light to this and other more abstruse Magnalia.</P>
<P>I have insisted so much the longer upon this Mystery of the Silk-worme, because (if it were handled by a better pen, judgement, and ability) it is every way noble and sublime, so much worthy the knowledge, not onely for the benefit (which is extraordinary rich how ever) but for the admiration of Nature, who hath ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evi∣ated all the Volums of her other Miracles into this her little, but exact Epitome, like that Artist who contracted the whole body
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>
of Iliads and Odysses into a Nutshell.</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sides what wee have sayd of Silke wee shall find the Indian profitable to himselfe, and as in the Staple of Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, of which when he has r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whole knowledge, wee cannot make the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st tittle of doubt, but he will with all eagernesse prosecute it: First, because it concernes his belly, to which no peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e under H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are more indulgent; and secondly, his Wife and Children who plant his Corne may take the charge of the Vineyard with not much more lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur. But that which turnes to our advantage is, that the Indian communicating the knowledge of the Grape to his Neighbours, and they transmitting it all along as far as New Spain, will stir up the Spanish jealousie to interdict all Viti-culture a∣mongst them, and as far as the extent of his power can fathome to prosecute severely all such Natives as shall make it a subject of their indu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try to the prejudice of Spaine. This must of necessity make strong combinations and leagues against the Spanish Tyranny, which though they are not of themselves able to shake off, yet will the Spanyard feare to extend himselfe further (except in such strength as at present his condition denies him) knowing the Indi∣ans untingu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shable thirst of Revenge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and his laying hold of all opportunities to put it in execution, with all the powers of his un∣derstanding cruelty and malice.</P>
<P>And thus shall the Spanyard in case he attempts our supplantati∣on be constantly discovered by the siding Indian, and if there be a necessity to prevent his malice, by turning his designe upon his owne head, infinite occasion of intelligence may wee have from the enraged Native, how to attaque him in his strongest security, where either the distance or impassability of the way will make him con∣fident and carelesse.</P>
<P>Further use may be made of the Native in fishing after Pearle, to which if wee allure him by a constant Trade with him for them, his owne profit will quickly enlighten his desire of more, and that desire quicken his industry.</P>
<P>That Virginia affordes multitude of Pearles, Mr. <HI>Lane</HI> is suffici∣ent to give publick information, where he tells us a Relation deli∣vered to him of a W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roance, who had so great quantity of Pearle, and did so ordinarily take the same, as that not onely his owne skinnes that he weareth, and the better sort of his Gentlemen and
<PB N="35" REF="27"/>
Followers are set with the sayd Pearle; but also his beds and hou∣ses are garnished with them, and that he hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such quantity of them that it is wonder to see: These are Mr. <HI>Lanes</HI> words exactly.</P>
<P>Nor is there any difficulty in the discovery of this, or ingrossing the Trade; especially since wee are the Masters of the Countrey, and if any other Nation should attempt to partake in the benefit of our Trade, the strength of Virginia is at present such as may repell by violence, all Forraigne incroachments upon their trade and livelyhood.</P>
<P>The Indians unanimously consent that twenty two mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s beyond <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Falls, is a Rocke of Chrystall, and this they evidence by their a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rowes very many whereof are headed with it. And that 3 dayes journey from thence, is a Rock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Hill of Silver Oare. Beyond which, over a ledge of Hills, by a concurrent Relation of all the In∣dians, is the Sea, which can be no other but that Sea which washes the shore of China, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That this report of a great Sea Southwest, beyond the Mountains, cannot have the least of fiction or confederacy, since all the Indians from Canada to Florida, doe unjarringly agree in the Rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, is obvious to the meanest apprehension.</P>
<P>The discovery whereof, if we fall upon it by degrees, will bee a worke of no long time or difficulty, but the unexpressible profit and glory of the action, will rayse the noble head of this above example Countrey to such a high Zenith of wealth, power, and lustre, that it will be reputed a very remarkable degree of felicity to any Nation which shall reach to such a Verticall point of glory, as to bee repu∣ted but our second in these most noble considerations.</P>
<P>By this meanes what wealth can there be in those richest provin∣ces of the World, in those Countries which Nature created for her Cabinets of excellency, which we shall not discover? What disco∣ver without a power of Appropriation? What opulency does Chi∣na teeme with which shall not be made our owne by the Midwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, by the Juno Lucina of this virtuall pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge?

The English name shall keepe company with the Sunne, and those Nations who owe him a particular adoration shall honour it as the next thing sacred.

And by this recourse all those curiosities of Art, in which those Easterne Nations transcend Europe, will bee conveyed to us with their per∣sons.

<P>But lest we should sing a Paean before a Victory, it will not bee unworthy our labour to discourse what meanes m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be used in this Discovery. Which if it should misse in its prosecution, (for which fayling there is not the least shadow of probability) yet might car∣ry a vast profit to recompence all your paynes and expences.</P>
<P>That it must not bee attempted at the first heat, but must have more recourses then one to the fire of a Triall, will bee made appa∣rent by these reasons.</P>
<P>First, the inconveniency or non feysibility of carrying so much provision as will serve the Discoverers, whose number, in my opi∣nion, cannot bee lower then two hundred, if wee le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slide into our deliberation the many unknowne Nations, through whose territo∣ries we are to make our passage, and which by common esti∣mation, are much more numerous in the Inland, then Marine Countreyes.</P>
<P>Next, admit wee undertake and compasse it with such a number, yet the discovery not being capable of secresie amongst such a mul∣titude of unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>takers, the publick resentment of such a felicity ap∣proaching, not suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring people to be silent: wee should have this ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive to the Spanyards knowledge, who will roule all stones under

Heaven to dispossesse or prepossesse, and indeed the danger his Peru, Chili and Philippines, by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch seating, may lie obnoxious to, will adde spurres to his inclination to prevent us, which till wee bee in in a condition to resist, may be effected with our absolute ruine.</P>
<P>The safest way therefore is, by degrees to steale upon the design, and take our way thither, by ceasing of places of advantage, very frequently found in that Contry, which we may progressionaly for∣tifie at every twenty or five and twenty miles distance, and to these places we may constantly send supplies of victualls and ammuniti∣on, not only for the men there Garrisond, but for our owne recep∣tion and maintenance in the Discovery: and these men standing continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly upon their guard, may (I meane those most remote) by conference with the Indians, discover with much ease, of what di∣stance, what accesse, what harbours, what frequentation, and by what people the neighbour Sea consists of; to take with them ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mplars of all Mineralls, Drugges, Dies, Colours, Birds and Beasts, drawne to the life in colours, which (by an invitation of reward) will be a surer meanes of discovery, (if any such be) then by multi∣tudes of people, whose number commonly (as in the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple of <HI>Fernando Soto</HI> in Florida) hastens no other discovery, but that of unavoydable famine, and being usually, either through necessity, or a disordred maner of living irregular and ungoverned, fright the in∣habitants from all commerce and conference or else make them join in a confederacy to abuse and remove them by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling their unwel∣come Company, golden lies, and miracles of Countreys farther di∣stant, where they are likely to find small satisfaction for their co∣vetousnes or hunger.</P>
<P>Reason and experience will condemne us of folly, if wee shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> refuse to profit by commendable examples, though proceeding from Enemies or Friends suspected: It will be therefore an incitement irreproveable to commend to our owne imitation the Custome which the industrious Spanyard practiseth in his designe of disco∣veries: Every one of the associates carry a little horne about their necks in such journeys, by which mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if the errour of the night or thickenesse of the Woods occasion any separation betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt them, or an Ambuscado of Enemies make the passage doubtfull, by win∣ding of that Horne, presently notice is given to the rest, who upon receiving the sound give the first winder notice of their residence,

to which they may repaire, or testifie their apprehension and readi∣nesse to prevent all hostile stratagems.</P>
<P>The same indefatigable Nation in their passage over Rivers, pre∣sently make themselves light Canoas after the Indian mode, with which entring themselves and swimming their Horses (whose heads they keepe above water by a coller fastened to the Boat) they over∣come difficulties of currents, which to any other but those seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insuperable, and indeed their labour in this kinde show them of ad∣mirable Resolution and Constancy.</P>
<P>Though wee may entertaine grounds of hope and confidence, that this discovery of the South Sea may be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de without any tedi∣ous Land-jou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney, since it is certaine that from the great confluence of Waters in the Gulfe of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>For our security it will be a naturall bar betwixt us and the jea∣lous Spanyard, who if he shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d injustly continue the possession of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Florida, which is indisputably English; yet thus dividided from us by a vast R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver full of Islands, and places convenient to command the Channell fortified and maintained by our Nation, he is too full of providence and caution to attaque us, if once in so good a posture.</P>
<P>For the conveniency which sufficiently speakes it selfe the ease of transportation by water, and all in our owne Chanell, the saving of Land charges, and probability of a more speedy passage, are prespi∣cuous arguments to commend it.</P>
<P>And to confirme the probabilities of this passage by the Lake the more strongly, the Indians of Canada confessed to <HI>Iames Cartier</HI> that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is but a Moneths sayling, from thence to go to a Land where Cynanon and Cloves are gathered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Others told the same person, that from the place where they left their Pinnace, there is a River which goeth South-West, from whence there is a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole Moneths

<P>Which if it should faile, why may not Virginia in her future fe∣licity of silke be a new China and Persia to Europe? why may not all the spicery of the East flourish with an equall successe in this our most justly tempered Climate? already can Virginia boast of Cina∣mon, which if transplanted might not be inferiour unto any? why may not the Cloves perfume Virginia with as aromatick redolency as the Philipine Gardens.</P>
<P>Our aire is more serene, better tempered then theirs, nor have we any more sense of Winter to hinder the ascent of sap then the Mo∣luccians, if it be any thing more harsh in cold, yet is it but a check to a peradventure too forward Spring.

<P>These allurements are for those whose delights onely are interest∣ed and denoted to this reti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed activity; but those who looke further will finde (that which is rarely or never contingent to other con∣tentments) this pleasure to be attended with an inestimable p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofit, and one of the most certaine returnes in nature: But this fertility-labouring Countrey, especial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in its Southerne beauties, in its Roa∣noak excellencies, like to a Princesse, all compos'd of Bounty, suf∣fers no addresse to be made unsatisfied.

it be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason that the nature of Plants, as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men, is desirous of Novelty and peregrination, or because that at their parting from their former grounds they leave there that ranke wildnesse virule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cy and ill quality from the Forest, where is first rooted the grate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull novelty and allurement of a well cultivated s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yle makes it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ceive a new by exiling it from the old savagenesse and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omestication of its first seat and nature.</P>
<P>Since then the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>moving of wild Plants addes so much to their improvement and melioration confirmed by naturall Reason and unerring experience: Why may not the diligent labour by remove∣all and transposing this excellent Staple of Silke grasse, make it thrive equally in greatnesse and goodnesse, there needes no more art to be used then th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of comparing the soile (transplantations into worse grounds being naturally improsperous) and though there ap∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re now somewhat of trouble (though nothing of lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur) in peeling the silky skinne of, yet that it may be broken as Flaxe or cleared by some Instrument (the Commodity richly rewarding the nobility of any invention) to this purpose; time and further exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rience will no doubt to the publick enric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of the Colony and this Nation make apparent.

<P>Next, what will not those Vines produce if well husbanded af∣ter their transplantation, and in this most delightfull labour the gain is so appare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t that almost the blindest judgement may perceive it.</P>
<P>Orenges, Lemons, Pine-aples, Plantanes, Peaches, Apricocks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Peares, Aples, in a word all sort of excellent Fruits will grow there in full perfection; you may sleepe whilst they are growing, after their setting or engrafting, there needes no more labour but your prayers, that they may prosper, and now and then an eye to pre∣vent their casualties, wounds or diseases.</P>
<P>Sugars, Indigos, Cotton, and Ginger, require a greater industry; but if wee consider the difference betwixt the two Climates of Barbadoes and Virginia, the immoderate heate of the first and the exact temper of the other, the labour though it may require as fre∣quent handling, yet is by much lesse toylesome.</P>
<P>In a word, if a man be yet timerous of a thriving condition in
<PB N="44" REF="32"/>
this Countrey; I shall with his pardon believe him, dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rustfull of Gods providence; or if he be so vitiously disposed as to hope after a Land where he may enjoy an undisturbed plenty without the sweat of his browes, the Maps are so extreamely deficient in the description of such a Countrey, that I must desire him to looke for a new World and Kingdome, for such an easie accommodation.</P>
<P>If any make an Objection why this Countrey stored with all these Riches, furnished with all these Staples, hath so long held downe her head in the lownesse of a desperate condition? Why being capable to crowne her browes with Garlands of Roses and plenty, she sate desolate amongst the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowes of neglect and poverty?

<P>But the incomparable Virgin hath rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed her dejected head, clea∣red her enclouded reputation, and now like the Eldest Daughter of Nature expresseth a priority in her Dowry; her browes encircled with opulency to be believed by no other triall but that of expe∣perience her unwounded wombe full of all those Treasuries which indeere Provinces to respect of glory, and may with as great justice as any Countrey the Sunne honours with his eye-beames, entitle her selfe to an affinity with Eden, to an absolute perfection above all but Paradize.</P>
<P>And this those Gentlemen to whom she vouchsafes the honour of her Embraces, when by the blessings of God upon their labours sated with the beauty of their Cornefield, they shall retire into their Groves checkered with Vines, Olives, Mirtles, from thence dilate themselves into their Walkes covered in a manner, paved with O∣renges and Lemmons, whence surfeited with variety, they incline to repose in their Gardens upon nothing lesse perfumed then Rose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Gilly-flowers.

<P>AS a Supplement to all which, since so many objections have beene, and are dayly made, lest a wilful silence might believe their scruples as authentick as reason it selfe; such as have beene made to me have had this answer returned them, with which I de∣sire to satisfie and communicate to all others who may have the same doubts.</P>
<P><PB REF="36"/>Why rather doe wee apply our selves to the South of Virginia, then the North? Why to a new where in probability all things may be wanting, rather then an old Colony where already there is great abundance?</P>
<P>To this may be returned, that the South of Virginia is more pro∣per then the North, by reason of its fertility and aptnesse to produce all those Staples o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sugar, Cotton, Ginger, which the colder aire in the North will not permit to flourish: That the South is more pro∣per, may appeare by the large quantity of Palmetoes which have been found there, who cannot flourish in any Countrey in which there may be so much as an appearance of Winter.</P>
<P>Neither need wee so much f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are a want or non-abundance in this new Colony, our nearenesse to Virginia and N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w England being a∣ble plentifully to furnish us with all sort of Cattle at a cheaper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate then in England, and the very r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>putation of this place once planted will quickly invite so many men as know by experience or infor∣mation the excellence of the place, to remove what ever is theirs out of those more cold Countries to joyne issue with us in the bet∣ter Sunbeam'd Carolana.</P>
<P>Another objection is, what security wee may expect from the Natives, who looke upon us as Intruders upon the Land of their Nativity, and seeing the South of Virginia in like manner to be possessed as the North, whether they will not in all probability at∣tempt what ever rage, malice, and treachery can dictate to them to oppose the beginnings of such possession to our extirpation, to which they will be more enabled (say they) since wee are at the first seating not likely to be so numerous, or so well fortified to re∣sist them, as in the North of Virginia, where already they have com∣mitted two mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cres notwithstanding the length of yeares to secure the implanters, and their large numbers.</P>
<P>Wee should attribute too much of the Bug-beare to the Indian armes, to believe that 10 of our men well appointed are not able to give law to their 100 aided with all the advantages of animosity and revenge, to which by nature I must confesse them prone, but their cowardise is so great, that they never act any thing but upon the scor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of anticipation or security; a nights march and the dawne of the day are the onely opportunities which they take to revenge former hostilities upon their sleeping enemies: he which considers

<P>The basenesse of these incomparable Poltrons considered, what cause should there be to feare them? yet to shew how those which through igno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance or doubt of their attempts may be sufficiently se∣cured, these remedies have been proposed and are resolved upon to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>move all futu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e attempts of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nature.</P>
<P>Our first seating will be upon as pleasant Islands as eye may de∣light, into which all accesse must be by water. The Indian (first bought out of those Seas, which a most inconsiderable trifle will pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chase and prohibited fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing there, with a severe punishment to all those who shall against such prohibition appeare with their Canoas upon the waters) cannot assemble upon the main to our pre∣judice, or gather together their Canoas without our notice; besides a small thing will buy spyes amongst themselves to discover all such practises; a knife or a hatch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will make them betray their neigh∣bours, or which is more, their kindred.</P>
<P>When our numbers (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the blessing of God) shall enable us to grow upon the maine, the same price which bought them out of Islands will purchase t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m out of the continent (I meane such a part of it as will sufficiently serve 100000. Inhabitants) in the bounds whereof no Indian shall appeare without an uncountrefaitable mark of permission, and spies used as before; we may make use of their intelligence concealing the Authors, which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll make those so discovered attribute to miracle what we receive by information<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and peradventure enter into a superstitious beliefe of our praescience of their machinations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which will deter their attempting the like for the future.</P>
<P><PB REF="37"/>Another objection which is usually made, whether this part of Virginia may not be too hot as the North of that Continent is too cold, considering the constitution of the English not proper to en∣dure it, the extreams of either being alike distastfull.</P>
<P>Though it be certaine that all over those Countries drawing near the Center of the Sun a constant Brise arises and continues from 9. to 3. with a great mitigation during the violence and height of the Sun, and that during those intervalls, servants are so indulged as not to labour without doors, yet it is certain that the violentest of heats in that Southern is not hotter then some dayes which we feele in England.</P>
<P>And though ancient Philosophy may stumble at the doctrine (able to make reason herselfe almost blear-eyed) yet those no lesse signall experiencers of the modern will tell us, that the causes of modera∣tion and habitability of those regions proceed from that which im∣posed upon our Patriarchs of learning, who upon favourable con∣jecture that the (supposed dangerous) neighborhood of the Sun, and the rapid transit of the cele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iall bodies, with the perpendicularnesse of direct rayes could not but perpetually exile all cold and moisture as non-naturall and forreine to their immediat residence. Neither had reason any allegations to the contrary, till experience opened its eye-lights by this demonstration, for moisture is never more vi∣olent in those (which we call torrid) regions then when the Sun is in his nearest visits; from hence arise winds and impetuous showers dayly, from hence the Sun having (in a degree of debauch) caronsed too much in his spacious and sweaty journey, over the Ocean does there discharge it; whereas in his abscence he receives no more of those moist vapours then he can temperately and healthfully con∣coct.</P>
<P>Besides, these frequent showers do not only coole and refresh the otherwise parching earth, but adde as much to its fatnesse and im∣provement, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the innundations of Nilus, Niger, and Zaire in A∣frica, and makes the earth invulnerable against the Sun's hostility &amp; arrowy beams: and as in an Alembick a fire of heat and violence enlargeth the quantity of vapours, which stifled as it were and issu∣lesse are converted into waters, but the fire being but meanly ea∣ger, drinks up those vapours in their exhaustion; so the Sun <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the greatnesse in the Giantism of his strength, onely exhales (not di∣gests)
<PB REF="37"/>
that quantity of vapours which he is inforced to disgorge in showers, which draughts of his are in his lesser heat in a more tem∣perate quantity imbibed and concocted.</P>
<P>Nor deserves it a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se part of consideration, that in that part of the world in which there are so many unbounded Gulphs, such im∣mense Rivers and inlets, the vapours and exhalations cannot but adde coolnesse and moisture to the neighbouring Elements of earth and aire: and which is an indisputable reason the almost equall length of dayes and nights dividing perpetually the time into equall portion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> causeth a lesse heat then presented it selfe to the conside∣ration-slumber of the ancients, which is confirmed by the Philoso∣phick Poet in these Verses.</P>
<Q><L>Quod{que} die solis violento in canduit aest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</L>
<L>Humida nox reficit paribus{que} refrigerat horis.</L>
<L>Nights what e're dayes burn with o're heated powers,</L>
<L>Coole and refresh by their length-equal'd houres.</L></Q>
<P>Joyne to this the plentifull discent of Dewes greater th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n unex∣perienced imagination can comprehend them, and in dispensation of moisture equall to petty showers behealth the dayes with coole∣nesse and freshnesse, which added to the neighbourhood of such an unfathomed depth, such an unembraceable greatnesse with their spa∣cious fluxes resolve the heated aire into a healthfull moisture: But nearer the Poles the continuance of the Sunne, the almost no nights, and long lived dayes make those parts more insufferably hot, then nearer an equall division of night and light, and this cause makes the Summer hotter in Russia then in England.</P>
<P>I had not dwelt so long upon this discourse, but onely to show that if the Centre and head-quarters of the Sunne perpetually assig∣ned betwixt the Tropiques be capable of coolenesse and habitabi∣lity: What shall Virginia a Region as fortunately and temperately seated as the noblest Countries under Heaven expect of moderate heates, and a by-these-infertiled surface?</P>
<P>To those other Questions how people shall transport themselves if of fortunes? how the lesse able be transported? what conditi∣ons they are to expect? I shall not doubt but publick bils will make manifest to them, and that speedily. For the other what meanes to live there? what way of improvement upon meanes? the book is referred unto for directions: But if that appeare unsatisfactory
<PB REF="38"/>
(that and all things humane being subject to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lings) I owe too much to my owne and that Countrey, not to give them further sa∣tisfaction to the best of my knowledge: And if they please to col∣lect the Stationers name and residence from the Frontispiece of the Booke, I am confident he out of his humanity and good affection, will either signifie to them where I may prefer my addresses to their information, or where I shall be to attend them, and withall con∣tribute my best knowledge in what may be usefull to them, or bring them to such of higher quality as may give them plenary satisfacti∣on.</P>
<P>It is my opinion (but the more ripe judgement of others) that this Countrey well husbanded, and peopled, will in regard of its variety of Staples, be such a constant entercourse of Traffick to our Merchant Adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, as to free them totally from all those dan∣gers which they now groane under, either by open hostility of knowne, or under hand dealing of pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te Enemies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trade will be so secured among our selves of all those Staples which France and Spaine sell us with a hand full of exaction and causelesse expostulati∣ons, that no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing but the casualties of the Sea will contribute to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st down countenances upon the Exchange or making our Mer∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants Bankrupt.</P>

to expresse our Civilities by vapour; and for all that vast Dowry of spaciousnesse, wealth, bounty of aire, and plenty of provisions, to proffer her a joynture of Tobacco, is a Com∣plement indistinguishable from incivill rudenesse.</P>
<P>What Riches may not the <HI>Silke-worme, Vine, Olive,</HI> and <HI>Almond</HI> afford us? By these noble undertakings wee contract <HI>China</HI> two thousand Leagues nearer to us, and are not trou∣bled though <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> were remooved five thousand more distant from us: and if wee could not satisfie the impla∣cable curiosity of our Senses without the Easterne Spices, it is without dispute, that what every Orient hath of Aromatick, would grow without any deterioration in this incomparable Countrey.</P>
<P>Yet if, by some occult propriety of nature, these Spices, and Gummes should not prosper with that successe in the Coun∣trey to which they are onely adoptive, as where they are natu∣rall: The South Sea flowing upon the skirts of this gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riously apparrelled Virgin, would not onely furnish us, but (through our meanes) all the Westerne World with whatever the <HI>Philip∣pines</HI> and <HI>China</HI> have in their brow, or bosome: which that it may be discovered, a Publique incouragement from the Merchants here, and the Colony there, would awaken all spirits which have any scintillation of Honour, or industry, to under∣take the imployment, effect it undertaken, and by the effect raise an unperishable structure for their owne glory, perpetua∣ted by the publique felicity.</P>
<P>The greatest defect that Colony can with consent complaine of, is their want of shipping, and the greatest with which o∣thers finde themselves perplexed, is the want of industry to build them. If <HI>Virginia</HI> had not as stately Timber as any other Region whatsoever: if it had not a Soyle naturally in∣viting them to improve her in Iron for Gunnes, Anchors,
<PB REF="41"/>
and other conveniences; in Hempe for Cordage, Flax for Canvase, and Pine trees for Mast: this defect might be allowed for reall: but where all these concenter, it is as unreasonable to complaine, as for a man seated at a Table covered with excellent provision, to accuse his fortune for suffering him to perish with hunger, because his meat is not digested in his stomack, without putting his hands and teeth to labour.</P>
<P>I could cordially wish that there were such quantity of clea∣red ground in <HI>Virginia,</HI> that every one at his first arrivall might fix upon the Plough, that the so much discoursed of Staples of Wheat and Rye, might be brought to an absolute ripenesse of perfection: But to imagine so many millions of trees of a facile removall, or that old Planters knowing the benefit thence arising, should part with them to others, and seeke new uncleared grounds for themselves, were meerely to dreame of impossibilities.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Vine, Almond,</HI> and <HI>Olive,</HI> may be set where the tree is onely barked about to hinder it from leaving; be∣sides if there were a necessity to have absolutely cleared grounds, (which reason it selfe cannot imagine,) yet foure Acres of ground so cleared for the <HI>Vine,</HI> will returne (by much) more profit, and lesse trouble, then twenty Acres of Wheat, at such rates as they are prized in the common estimation.</P>
<P>But since this profit reverts to the Purse without the toyle of eradicating trees, as great emolument, as if the ground were altogether treelesse, to what purpose should we court sweat and affliction? or increase our miseries without any addition to our happinesse?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the happinesse of this Nation depends upon your constancy and prosperity, if you seriously erect these staples, wee shall be free from the imperious usurpations of forraigne Prin∣ces

<P>A great care must bee had to water it often for the first yeare, if the weather be dry, the succeeding yeare you may pul up and trans∣plant your Mulberry trees into another ground more at large, <HI>viz.</HI> at two or three foot distance, which must bee not retransplanted till the growth arise to some six inches in the circumference, at which bignesse you may remove them to the ground designed for their constant fixation, leaving betwixt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach Tree a distance of six∣teene or twenty foot, that the too much vicinity may not make the extending branches mutually inconvenience either by exclusion of a full Sunne, or wound themselves by intertangence of one another: In such warme Countries as that of <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Root must bee preserved coole and moyst, by a deeper implantation then is usuall in colder Regions.</P>
<P>For the election of your Plants or Sciens you may take notice of two Families, or Races, of Mulberry trees, the black, and the white, discordant in Wood, Leafe, and Fruit; onely having this in com∣mon to spring later then other trees, as never emitting their leaves till all apprehension of cold is vanished, the black Mulberry is not subdivided into any other species having the wood solid and strong, the leafe large, and rude in the handling, the fruit black, great, and acceptable to the Palate: But there are three apparent∣ly different species in the white, distinguished onely by the colour of the fruit, namely, white, black, and red: Yet is this fruit by
<PB N="3" REF="43"/>
much le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se gratefull to the palate then that of the black Mulberry. No other distinction besides, the colour of the fruit discernes them one from the other, the Leaves of all three being of the same meane greatnesse of the same smooth feeling, the wood of the same internall yellownesse, almost as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irme as that of the black Mulber∣ry.</P>
<P>But the silke taking his quality from the leafe make us lay aside the black Mulberry tree, since the bottomes from thence are too grosse and heavy, whereas the white Mulberry makes silke fine and light, to temper which many feed the Wormes with two sorts of meats by dictinction of times, <HI>viz.</HI> at the beginning with white leaves, that the silke may bee fine, in the closing, with black to fortifie it, and make it weigh: Yet this though it have an ap∣pearance of reason at the first inspection, rarely answers the ex∣pectation, the very alteration of the meate as from that which is more delicate, to that which is more grosse, being disagreable to the nature of the Worme, who must shew that diminution in the quality of his silkes which hee feeles in the impairing of his nutri∣ment. Others make a contrary application of leaves by a more (imaginative solid foundation) which is to begin their dieting with black, and conclu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with white; which cannot succeed bet∣ter, for the black having disposed the matte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the silke, the white leaves after administred have no power to alter that seminall dispo∣sition.</P>
<P>Wee shall therefore fixe upon it as a Principle of Nature, not to vary the nourishment of this industrious Creature. If wee be∣gin with the black Mulberry, the continuance of it will bee neces∣sary. If the Ground you possesse bee already planted with black Mulberries, it is so much losse of time and expences to replant white: But if wee are to commence a thing <HI>de Novo,</HI> every mans reason leading him to chuse the most profitable, and common ex∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rience telling us that the white antecede the black ones so incre∣dibly in the poynt of Matu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, that six years of growth advance not so much the latter as two the first; it were an act declaring Bethlem for Dictator, not to prefer the most speedy and profita∣ble before the tedious and improper commodity. Besides which Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lument the Branches which by that speedy shoot they bring
<PB N="4" REF="44"/>
forth will bee usefull for propagation of that tree to infinite Num∣bers.</P>
<P>There is yet experimentall election amongst the white Mulber∣ries. Some affirming that the Leaves of those trees which emit the white fruit are fittest to bee assigned for this nourishment, which they fortifie by this reason; That Pullen and Swine doe most de∣light in the white, and never eate the red and black but by con∣straint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a conjecture not altogether irrefragable; for why may it not bee controverted that Pullen and Swine being a greedy Gene∣ration, may rather ballance that which is most grosse and fulsome, as best adapted for their Palate, then that which is nice, and subtle, and best according to the delicate tendernesse of this Creature? Others who have their owne experience to fortifie their assertion, commend the white Mulberry bearing the black fruit, the colour demonstrating a better concoction in the fruit, and consequently in the leafe then the others.</P>
<P>But (which wee must bee extreamely curious in) wee must ex∣pell from our yard all Muberry trees bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing leaves too much inden∣ted, which, besides that it is an apparent signe of small subsistence and uncompleated nature, is more defective in quantity and quali∣ty of nourishment, then that which is lesse interruptedly circular: Yet this may easily bee remedied, if you <HI>inoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late</HI> such trees in the Bud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or <HI>Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucheon,</HI> having neede of such freedome; the profit thence arising being very considerable for this kinde of nourish∣ment: For by this course that inconsiderable quantity of worthless and famelick leaves receives a happy melioration into an abundant plenty of substantiall and nutritive nature.

<P>The other way of gathering them with stripping them from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> branches, is without doubt extreamely nocent to the tree, and worm: to the tree by unbarking, wounding and perishing its bran∣ches.

<P>The remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of these inconveniences is easily effected by follow∣ing the course they practice in some parts of Spaine, which is by clipping the leaves from the branches with a sharpe in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trument, like a Taylors sheares; by this way you disleave many stalkes at once, which falling into a cleane sheete spread under that tree for the purpose, seperating afterwards the leaves also<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound from unsound, such as peradventure have much of the stalke, from those which are nothing but leafe, (the stalke being hurtfull to this tender Creature) and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ministred to them the Sunny side of the leafe upward is the most commendable practise of gathering and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eding that hath hitherto been delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="46"/>The leaves of the old Mulberry are to bee much prefer'd before those which are not come to an absolute perfection; the age of perfection in the Mulberry, we reckon to be accomplished in seven or eight yeares, as to soundnesse of nourishment; not that they grow not after, but by that time it is growne powerfull to concoct such succulency as might before over master it.</P>
<P>The trees disleaved must by a diligent hand be pruned immediat∣ly after the last collection; what ever is broken, wounded, or made unprofitable must bee carefully cut off. The extreames of all the branches must be top'd a little with a sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpe pruning knife, which is an invitation to nature to send forth the next yeare more vigo∣rously. But whether it be in gathering the leaves, or pruning the trees, it must bee our principall care that they be intirely beared, the omission of which, by not taking all the leaves off, turnes back the liberallity of the repeating Spring. This observation hath been grounded upon practise, made so successefull by experience, that it hath been found, that trees after such culture and disleaving, have within a month attired themselves with such a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w border of leaves, that the former imbalding them hath been impercep∣tible.</P>
<P>Which induces me to believe a former assertion, that it is possible to have a second silke harvest by this meanes, and why not equall with the first, I know not, since the seed is more youthfull and vi∣gorous then that of the yeare preceding growne feeble by its con∣tinuance.</P>
<P>The raines if they fall about the time this noble creature drawes unto her perfection and period, is by much more strangely prejudi∣ciall, then when they are in the greatest of their feeding, the wet leaves occasioning them many desperate diseases: the usuall way of prevention is to have a provision of leaves before hand, when there is any jealousie of rainy weather; but this provision must be laid in a cleane dry place which is fresh aired, and that we may re∣move all dangers of contracting too much heat, to be turned often, which course, although the Raine should not oppresse us, yet is it of great conveniency, not so much out of apprehension to be nece∣ssitated as for the quality of the food, it being much better after fourteen or fifteen houres resting in a place cleane and drie, then <PB N="9" REF="46"/>
when fresh from the tree. But if you are surprized by an unexpe∣cted season of wet, take those Mulberries which you intend to lop the next yeare, (and the Mulberry would be lop'd every ten or twelve yeare, which revives and strengthens the tree with a new youth) and cut their branches which hung up in a drie corner, ei∣ther of your house or barne, or any other coverture in airy places, will soone have their leaves drie, better condition'd, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of more efficacy then any leaves set to a fire, which is too suddaine, or to winnowing by a winde artificiall and unnaturall.</P>

<P>But leaving this to the scrutiny wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch shall be made by time, and experience, we must grant the prime opinion to the Spanish, which however it thrive in France for foure yeares, yet afterwards it degenerates extreamely, so that it must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very foure yeares be renew'd, for within that circle it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s a manifest d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clension in goodnesse.

<HEAD>The vivification of the Seed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Spring being come, and the Mulberries budding, it will be seasonable to put them to hatching, which (all other wayes omitted, as the keeping them in a Boxe, in ones pocket, between a womans Breasts, &amp;c.) sorts best with Reason and convenience, performed thus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>viz.</HI> That the seed removed from its first vessell, shall be committed into a Box lined with Cotton, over which you must put a white paper, which must seperate the seed from the Cotton, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cover the seeds (being not above halfe an inch thick) with a little b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Tow, over which Tow you are to lay a paper pierced very thick with small holes, much about the bignesse of the tag of a point; over this paper you shall lay some Mulberry leaves. And this is the preparative to hatch them.</P>
<P>To bring them forth, lay your Boxe so prepared between two Pillowes, which moderately warmed with a Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every two houres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and after the first three and foure dayes visiting the Box at every such warming, to the end to seperate such as you shall see hatched, who will not faile to creep through the Tow, and pierced paper to the Mulberry leaves, to which they will cleave: which to remove,

you must draw them out of the Boxe by taking hold of the Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber∣ry leave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a needle, and removing them and the Wormes adherent into a bigger Boxe or sieve; with paper at the bottomes, distinguish those of a hasty production from those of a more slow, that the worke may arise more equall. These thus brought forth must by gradations be accustomed to indure the coolenesse of the Spring, diminishing dayly something from his accidentall warm∣nesse: the first foure daies let them in the sieve covered with cleane linnen continue upon the bed, the curtaines closely drawne, then removed into a warme chamber, close from all penetrations, layd upon ranks close together, that they may give and receive mutuall warmth, allowing them a larger proportion of roome, as they in∣crease in body.</P>
<P>But the most assured way to preserve the Wormes untill their second change in warmth and security from Vermine, dust, or o∣ther hostilities of nature, is by a great Presse or Cubbord made with many stages, parget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed or pasted for the agreeablenesse of the odou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Oxe dung, made of firre, or mats, and to draw out at will seperately, equally distant foure inches, compassed round about with Linnen tackt to the doores, with paper w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndowes on the sides and formost doore, to admit or exclude aire after the exigency of the occasion; and heere vacant places being left at first to enlarge them, as they increase in growth may they bee distinguished accor∣ding to the Dates of their first appearance upon the Mulberry, re∣jecting all that seed, which is not enlivened before the fifth day, as unprofitable for working by confusion of times, and uselesse by their weaknesse.</P>
<P>Foure times doth this excellent Artist change his skinne, which is the cause of his so many sicknesses. The first sicknesse arriving within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight dayes from the beginning of his life, is knowne by these symptomes; the head growes bigge and white, and hee hides hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under the leaves: To administer any food were need∣less<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but that they are not all sick at one instant, so that some must bee giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to nourish them which have not arrived to, or past over their sicknesse, which you shall know by their change of colour and creeping upon fresh leaves.</P>
<P>The second sicknesse arising within eight dayes, or thereabouts,
<PB N="20" REF="52"/>
from thence is knowne by the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> accidentalls, and must have the same applications, onely now they would bee removed into new, cleane, and more spacious places: The third is in all like the two other, though something more dangerous; heere you must care∣fully prevent the accession of all cold ayres whatsoever: It may happen that some of these Wormes may grow yellow, which is almost incurable in themselves, and deadly contagious to all the rest; these must bee carefully selected from the rest and ejected. Remove, enlarge &amp; cleanse as before. Eight or ten dayes after appears the 4. change or sicknes, &amp; now the recovered Worms being increased to their full growth, must be removed, enlarged, &amp; cleansed, as before.</P>
<P>At appoynted houres morning and evening must this Worme be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fed from their hatching to their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st change or sickness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; from the second change to the third or fourth, they must bee fed three times the day at the least, taking this for an assured maxime, that after the recovery from their last siknesse, The very cloying of them with leaves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even to the satiety of their appetite, accelerates them to the perfection of their taske; for these curious Vessells will the sooner discharge themselves of their precious inclosed sub∣stance, by how much they are the sooner replenished. Nor is there any prodigall improvidence in this; for it hath beene obser∣ved that Wormes have eaten neare as much in eight dayes when more sparingly distributed, as in foure when liberally handed to them; so that by such wary dispensation they save no leaves, and lose foure dayes in point of time.</P>
<P>But a particular eye of care must bee had to the quality of the leaves you feede with. No goodnesse of a selected tree being ca∣pable to secure it selfe against accidentall diseases arising from the unnaturallnesse of seasons, wherein by extreames of drought or moisture, mildewes, heat drops, and other distempers, all the leaves oftentimes becomming yellowish, spotted, or speckled, declare the nature of that food highly unwholesome and pernicious: Such as grow out of the Sunne in the interior umbragious parts of thick trees are almost as dangerous: No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are the leaves of the second Spring which shoot afresh on trees already disleaved of lesse guilt, through the inequality of their Ages<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> One banquet of those gives the last repast that your Wormes shall have neede of, a fluxe thence

<P>This expeditious winding prevents the enclosed Worme of her full metamorphose into a Butterflye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the bottome from perfo∣ration: But then where shall wee finde so many workemen if the designe were generall, as could in seven or eight dayes winde off so many millions of bottomes? Not excluding therefore such as can have that conveniency, the next best course to kill the Butter∣flyes in those bottomes which wee cannot winde off, is by expo∣sing and laying them in the Sunne, the heate of which in its owne worke stifles this Creature: But let this bee two or three daye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> successively (not all at one exposure, lest your silke be burned in∣stead of stifling its spinner) two houres before, and two houres af∣ternoone

each day respectively. Let the bottomes, spread upon sheets be turned often, that the heate may destroy equally, no one excepted from this sharpe insolation; but this must not bee done with a rude hand, which instead of turning them may bruise the Worme, the slimy matter of whose body, being thus bruised, is very pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>judiciall both for staining the silke, and gluing it so toge∣ther, that no Artist can ever unwinde them.</P>
<P>Removing them therefore oftentimes during such sunning with a gentle hand, wrap them thus warmed in sheets, and let them lye in a fresh dry chamber.</P>
<P>But if the Sunne should faile, an Oven of such moderate heate as is usuall after two houres drawing the bread, or heated to such a degree of warmth (laying it over with boards, and the bottomes in sacks upon those boards, there remaining each time an houre and a halfe, repeating it till your experience by opening the most suspected bottome finde the inclosed Worme consumed) will bee of equall operation.</P>
<P>But that which is the best and least practised course is this: Take your bottomes, and fill such a Furnace or Copper as your Brew∣ers use, halfe full of Water: Within three fingers breadth of this boyling water, lay a lid or planke or board within the Copper, bo∣red through as thick with holes as a Cullender, and so fit to the side of the Furnace, that it by no meanes may sinke into the water: Upon this cover lay a thin Carpet of Darnix, or the like, and upon the Carpet the silke bottomes, which must bee often stirred, with care not to use too much violence. The mouth of the Copper, except when you stir the bottomes, must bee constantly covered, that the h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are may smother the Wormes: Your Wormes being dead, lay your bottomes in some roome, where there is aire to dry their moysture.

<P>But that they may not bee ignorant of the profit of the Vine, they will bee pleased to know that the Vine requires (once plan∣ted) little more labour then the Hoppe. To attend upon foure A∣crees of Hops is the ordinary undertaking of one man in ENG∣LAND, who besides this, neglects not many other labours. If one man in VIRGINIA bee not sufficient to doe as much as another in ENGLAND, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall either imagine him to bee lame or idle; nor let them object to me the heat of the Countrey; if the mid-dayes be hotter, the mornings are much colder, and the Labourer in VIRGINIA hath this advantage of being full of bread to satiety, whereas oftentimes the Hireling in ENGLAND having a family to feed, and sometimes no imployment, comes to worke with a famish'd body<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and courage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives meerly <HI>de die in diem,</HI> with as little hopes of ever changing the copy of his fortune, as renew∣ing the lease of his Cottage with his Landlord: those are but leane encouragements.

<P>By this I hope it granted, that the VIRGINIAN may without any extraordinary efforts of sweat and spirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abour equally with those of ENGLAND, and upon this accompt I shall assigne a Vig∣nard of four Acres to his tillage, an easie taske; let us compute the profit with the labour, and see what may be the proceed of this proportion well husbanded.</P>

<P>Here they will object the dearenesse or difficulty of Caske; but this objection must be made by those who know not VIRGINIA, where there is such an excellent convenience, and abundance of pe∣culiarly proper Timber, that the Winter will afford the other La∣bourers together with our Vigneron leasure, to cleave Pipe-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taves sufficient for private use of Caske, and to sell to the publique; one man (during that little season) being easily able to make foure thousand.</P>

<HEAD>What soyle is most proper for the Vine.</HEAD>
<P>HEE which will goe to plant the Vine without the twinne con∣sideration of the qualyty of the soyle, and the disposition of the aire, hath much affinity with him who goes to Sea without Lead or Compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se: the one seldome attaines his Port, nor the other his Harvest.</P>
<P>The quality of the ground whereon the Vine thrives best, is a fine small Mould, of a subsistance rather inclining to a gentle light∣nesse, then a churlish stubbornesse: they which would not have it to be very fat, are ignorant that while the Vine is yong, the soyle wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re you plant may be imployed to other tillage, and by such expence of its native richnesse, reduced to that which they com∣mend so highly, mediocrity: But if the fatnesse of the ground transmit a rich and never-failing sap into the nascent Vine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making it grow speedy and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongly, if the Vine participate of this fat∣nesse, which it may be they call grossenesse, as desiring to have it more subtile, there is small question to be made, but that this Wine so imbodied and fortified by nature, must have extraordinary spi∣rits to preserve it, and that age will have refined all that grossenesse into more pure and noble spirits; that if transported, the Sea will contribute to its melioration: whereas this Wine which they call subtile and delicate spirits, if either preserved long or transported far, will with so much applauded subtilty and delicacy lose all his spirits by age and evaporation.</P>
<P>Scruple therefore at the richnesse of your ground no more then at the ranknesse of your purse; tis in your power to correct either, if there were necessity: let it have the qualities of gentle, easie, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, and light, to be stirred, seated (if possible) on the decline of a Hill, not neare to any Marish ground, nor having any springs gliding through it; these Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h grounds you must avoyd as you would doe Levell in a Valley. And the reason is, that the Vine growing in these parts has a crude and undige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted bloud, quickly soures, and has neither strength to commend or preserve it, and the Frosts in the winter time sinking to his roots, by the moyst passage of his scituation, kills it; the Grapes plumpe and breake, and when as

<P>But VIRGINIA has a more certaine assurance; God and na∣ture have pointed them a soyle out with their owne finger; let them therefore fix their eyes upon those places where either the Vine or Mulberry grow conjoyn'd, or seperate, and let them assure themselves of the excellency of the soyle, a diffidence in this being an affront to Nature: yet this caution is to be used that though Val∣leyes are Marshy places, may sometime have them by nature, yet their florescence would be much more excellent and healthfull if removed to such a ground as formerly we have made choise of.</P>

<P>CUriosity about the choise of your Vine Plants will commend your Husbandry; let the Vine therefore from whence you take your Plant be of as little Pith as may be, such unpithy Vines being both fruitfull and fortified by nature, bearing a remarkable abundance of substantiall Grapes, and strongly resists the violence of the weather, and of this fertility and firmenesse will your Plant also participate. Let not the Vine you meane to plant from, be a∣bove the middle of his strength, or age, and observe about Septem∣ber those which are most laden with Grapes, fullest of eyes in their

branches, and have been least wounded by the unseasonablenesse of Weather. Take not a Vine growing on a South side, to transplant him to a Northerne: and set this downe for a principle in Nature, that all plants removed to a better scituation and soyle, answer your largest hopes, by their fruitfulnesse: but transplanted to a worse, assure your se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe that without an extraordinary cultivation, there cannot be the least probability of its thriving.</P>
<P>Let your Plant (if you may with conveniency) immediatly be planted after its seperation from its originall; for while it yet re∣taines any vitall vigour, it will the sooner apply it selfe to the de∣sire of life and nourishment. If your necessity will not admit of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estination, wrap it tenderly in its owne earth; and when your leisure will permit you to plant it, let it soake some foure or five dayes in water, and (if possible) running water: this immer∣ging is a very strong preparative to its sudden taking root.</P>
<P>If you apprehend a necessity of keeping him long or transpor∣ting him, (imagine it the Cyprian or Calabrian Grape thus to bee transportable into Virginia,) put him into a close Barrell fil'd up with earth; and that no aire may mortifie him, let both ends of the Plant be put into Onions or Garlick, or (which is better) made up with wax, and now and then watred, but not more then to keep the earth from resolving into a dry dust; for too much moy∣sture might (instead of preserving him) make him fructifie, and your Plant would become all root.</P>
<P>Wee have already spoken how we must chuse, but not what we must make choice of: Let your Plants therefore be of those which grow between the highest and lowest, (the lowest having too much of earthy juice, and the highest too little) let them bee round, smooth, and firme, having many eyes, and about one foot and a halfe of old wood cut off with the new.</P>

<P>Not enumerating therefore all their wayes of Planting, I dare lay my life that if the Vine were but set on foot in VIRGINIA, the ground prepared for it as they doe their Tobacco there, by a right line, holes made instead of their Hillocks, but larger, deeper, and at greater distance, that there might something grow betwixt them which might be inoffensive to it by nature, and cleare it from being choak'd with weedes, or something drawing a con∣trary juice, (peradventure Onions and Garlick) or something re∣quiring small nourishment, (as Lupins) which turn'd into the earth againe (distance of five foot being left for a Plough, with caution not to come too neare the Roots, which must be bared with a stowe, the Plough running first the length, and then the traverse of those rowes, which therefore must bee lineally straight) would both fatten the earth, and cultivate the Vine all at one moment. Yet submitting my selfe to judgements of greater experience then my modesty or na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e can ever hope for, I shall deliver the seve∣rall way of planting the Vine, with as much brevity as the matter, and my first resolution rather to contract then inlarge, will per∣mit mee.</P>
<P>The first preparing of the earth to receive the Vine must bee done in Spring or Summer, where the ground you digge or cast mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t bee cleansed from all manner of superfluities whatsoever; namely, Roots, Weedes, Stones, &amp;c. this digging must bee severall times repeated, that the earth by alternate changing its place of top and bottome may bee throughly tempred, the dry refreshed, and the moyst qualified: Thus cleansed, cast it into many furrowes (the sides whereof the French call Chevaliers or Guides, because it should guide you in the planting) the depth of eighteene inches or more; let the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld cast up above, bee so disposed, that it may an∣swer to the depth below.</P>

ordinary brick (but round) not bigger, which in the heate of Sum∣mer refreshes, in violence of Raine opens a passage to the water, that it dwell not at the Root to rot it.</P>
<P>The best season for planting of Vines is in October, the Moone increasing, the Furrowes must bee made in August, that the expo∣sed earth may have time of digestive preparation.</P>
<P>If your plant have Roots, you must when you plant it cut them off all, except it bee newly gathered, if it bee a slip or cut, which though it bee not so swift of growth the first yeare, yet is of much longer continuance, you must soake it in water, if it bee possible in running water five or six dayes.</P>
<P>Hee which plants the Vine, the ground thus prepared, and have∣ing a line with him, that hee may observe a just evennesse and streightnesse, both in the Row, and to the opposite Plant, that so every foure may make a regular quadrangle, must bow his plant, the bigger end forward one foot into the earth of the Ditch, let∣ting first some of the Mould from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides fall into it; let him tread upon the Mould the better to fixe the plant, and with his hand (the foot still pressing upon that part of the plant which is inearthed) gently raise or bow the top of the plant that it may grow erect: this done, let him cast some more Mould on it, to the thicknesse of six inches, and cut the top of the Plant, so as not to leave above three knots or joynts above the earth: Let him pro∣ceede in planting of the rest, observing the prescribed order: some set two plants together in this order, that if one should faile, the other might recompence the default.</P>
<P>If you will have your Vine to grow without stakes or props, cut it so, that you let it not increase above two or three joynts in the yeare, which will make it to stand firme against all stormes, if but naturally violent.</P>
<P>It will bee extreame ill husbandry to plant Vines of different kindes or qualities together, such diversity there is in their season of ripenesse; some preventing your expectation by the suddaine∣nesse of their maturity, others deceiving it by their late ripenesse.

<P>To provide against the blasting of your Vine: When you per∣ceive it upon the point of budding, cut it as late as may be; for

this late cutting it will make your Vine something later, and by consequence, blossome or flower at such time as the Sunne is ascen∣ded to his greatest degree of heat and fervor.</P>
<P>To breake off such Mists and Fogs as are already gathered in the aire, and give probable menaces to fall upon your Vines, you must apply your selfe to this remedy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> let a smoake round about your Vineyard be made with Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, kindled an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> set on fire.

<P>It is an opinion no way contradicted, that fertility is restored to a Vine become barren, if humane Urine kept a long while stale, to make it the more salt and ranke, be dropt by degrees upon the Vine stock, which must immediately after be laid about with dung and earth mixt together: the season for the application of this Cure mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be in Autumne.

Have they wanted the Sunne and Dew when upon the stalk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Could not the same Sunne and Dew which enripened them, refine and purifie them there? As for the earths meliorating them, if melioration bee understood by putrifaction, 'tis easily granted; Apples that
<PB N="49" REF="66"/>
lye on the ground are so meliorated, that is to say rotted, and shall the Grape a more delicate and tender fruit avoyd it? This is by way of digression, but it is necessary; for without this caution a modest man which reades with an obedient judgement any bookes of these men, taking the Authour for an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, subscribes to it, observes the prescription, and gaines a doctrine of future provi∣dence, by the losse of his present Vintage.</P>
<P>But after the Grapes have remained a day or two in the house, it will bee time to put them into the Fatt to bee trodden out equal∣ly. Those which tread the Grapes should before they go into the Fatt have their feete and legges washed extreamely, and themselves covered with a shirt as well as drawers, that their sweat may not mixe with the Wine, and that nothing in the act of eating fall from their mouths into it, they must bee punctuall in abstaining from eating of the Grapes, while they are at this their labour.</P>
<P>Surely this way of treading the Grape is derived from some ab∣stenious man, who devised this stratagem under a pretence of ex∣pediting the worke; but indeede to deter men from drinking that which is so uncomely prepared. I know they will alledge that by treading it flowes more naturally, and with all more pure forth, then that which is pressed; but withall give mee leave, say that the very Presse it selfe if it bee not too violently and greedily la∣boured, makes it glide forth altogether as naturally and purely, and which is more with greater equality; for in the Presse, all the Grapes feele the impultion at once, and if the Owner bee not too covetous to bring the drosse and gros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e parts of the Grape to a se∣cond squeezing, and mixing with the first; without dispute the Wine so expressed is altogether as good and strong as that which is trodden, but I am certaine much more cleanly.</P>
<P>The Wine (however) being expressed must be poured, drosse, Huskes, and all, into a Fat to worke or boyle in, which it must doe for the space of foure and twenty houres at the least, if you will have it fine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> delicate, and subtile; but if you desire to have it strong and noble, let it worke in the Fat foure or five day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, with a Cove∣ring over it, that so the vapour thereof may not exhale, or his force waste it selfe.</P>
<P>The Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Tub prepared, must have immediatly before his re∣ception

of the Wine, a little bunch of Vine branches laid before the Tap-hole, which (that it may not heave up with the Wine) must be kept downe with a cleane stone or Brick, or which is bet∣ter and lesse offensive, a ring of Lead wound about it: this when you draw the Wine will hinder the Huskes or Grapes from com∣ming out with the liquor. Your Fat must not be full by halfe a foot or more, that the Wine may have the more space to boyle or worke in.</P>
<P>Your Wine invessel'd must not be filled up to the Bung, nor the Bung closed, that the Wine may have the greater liberty of de∣spumation, and rejecting whatever it findes reluctant to its owne nature.</P>
<P>Every day you must fill up what is expurged, and something more, till you finde the Wine throughly appeased, and discharged of whatever might be obstructive to its generosity: nor must this Caske be in the Cellar, but either in the open aire, or in some Barne where it has a liberall respiration; besides the defects in Caske cannot be so easily discovered when the Wine is in the Cel∣lar, as in open places. When it is so throughly settled, that it hath given over all appetite or signe of boyling, you may have it com∣mitted to your Cellar, which should stand upon the North here, (in VIRGINIA upon the North-west as the coolest and driest An∣gle) paved with gravell or drye earth, which is lesse subject to moysture or exudations then Brick, or especially stone, absolutely remote and unmolested by any ill odours of Stables, Sinkes, Bathes, Marshy places, &amp;c. neither should it have any thing shut up or kept in it, which have any sent of acrimony or harshnesse, as Cheese, Garlick, Onions, Oyles, (Trane, Neatsfoot, Linseed, and others, not the Salade-Oyle) it being observed, that nothing is more open or obnoxious to contagion then Wine, especially when new.</P>
<P>Your Vessells must be so rank'd in order that they touch not one another, by this meanes to leave a liberty of sight to foresee a mis∣fortune, or prevent it when happened. They must be so close stopped in the Bung with Clay, that not the least irreption of aire may be capable to taint it, to which it is very subject.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Olive.</HEAD>
<P>THE Vine and Olive being such delightfull associates as to expresse a mutuall emulation for the Glory of fertility when planted together. This Treatise shall not divide them, they are both exhilaratives, the Vine rejoyces the heart, the Olive glads the countenance; and that VIRGINIA may expresse the delight she affords to mankinde by being reinforced with this second Sister of laughter, the Olive; this discourse particularly designed to her im∣provement, showes its planting and culture when planted.</P>
<P>The Olive tree, though it delight in a rich fat ground; yet if he have a warme aire, and a South, or South-East wind to refresh him, will in all places testifie a bounteous gratitude for its scituation in an almost unlaboured for fertility: Yet to prepare a place for this rich plant to prosper on, his prosperity being no small part of your owne, you must digge the pits where you intend to plant them, a yeare before such implanting; in this pit burne some straw, or which is better castings of Vine or Brambles (but no part of Oake, there being such a particular enmity betwixt this tree, and the Oake, that the Olive not onely refuses its neighbourhood, but dies if planted in the place where the Oake has beene rooted up) or you may leave it to the Sunne and Raine, which will without such a∣dustion exhale and purifie all infectious vapours: The place being provided to plant upon, we must next select our Plant.</P>
<P>Select your Plants from the Shoots or Branches of those Olive trees which are yong, faire, and fertile: Let them bee in thickne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se the circumference of an ordinary wrist, in length eighteene inches; plant it the bigger end downewards into the earth, prepared as be∣fore,
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
and ramme the Mould, mingled with Dung and Ashes close about it: Let it be digged every yeare in Autumne. The time to plant it is in April or May, it must not be transplanted for the first five yeares, nor the Bough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cut or pruned till it have attained eight. Graft it not but upon it selfe, so will it beare fruit better in the species and number; in its transplantation you must take up as much of the soyle with its roots, as you can possible, and when you reset it, give it the like scitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion for Coast and Quarter that it had before.</P>
<P>Olives are intended for two uses when gathered; either to bee served up at the table in collation, or to make Oyle of the largest sort of Olive, is most proper for the table, the lesser more particu∣larly convenient for Oyle: They must bee gathered with the least offence to the tree that may bee, the bruising of the branches with Poles as some use it in striking downe the fruit, makes the tree bar∣ren: The best way therefore is to ascend the tree by a Ladder, in faire weather (not so much for conveniency of the Gatherer; as for the profit comming from the Olive, which is not to bee taken from the tree, but when it is exceeding dry) and pulling them with your hand put them into a Wicker Basket, which you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall have carryed up with you to that purpose. Those Olives you intend to preserve or pickle, must not have that full ripenesse which is re∣quisite for those you purpose to make Oyle of. The Olives which you keepe for Banquets must be full of flesh, firme, fast, large, and ovall; if you will pickle them, put them into an earthen pot, and cover them with salt brine or verjuice, or else with Honey, Vine∣gar, Oyle and Salt smally beaten. If you intend to keepe them long, by changing your salt brine constantly every two or three Moneths, you may effect it.</P>
<P>For the Olives whereof you are to expresse your Oyle, you must gather no more at one time then what may be made into Oyle that day, and the day following: before you bring them to the Presse let them be spred upon hurdles, well pick'd, and cul'd; let the hurdles not be too thick set with twigs, that the Lees and watry humor of the Olive (which if expressed with Oyle would make it extreame full of faeculency, and corrupts it both in the nostr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and Palate) may expend, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te it selfe, and drop through; some there∣fore

<P>THough the Almond tree delight particularly in gravelly pla∣ces, of which VIRGINIA is too rich to afford a convenien∣cy; yet there is no dispute, but if the Mould wherein you plant them bee mingled with Oyster-shels, or such like, of which there is to bee found inexhaustible Quantities, they will have a greater virtue then gravell to the quickning and ingerminating of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree; having the perplexed hardnesse of gravell and unctuousnesse of marle united. The soyle thus prescribed; let the seat of your Almond be in a hot place fully exposed to the South or South-West, and it will not onely flourish to your expectation, but its fruit will bee excellently qualified, and in vast abundance: it groweth very well of the stone, which because it cannot bee procured new should be kept close in a Vessell of earth; to be transported, set it as you would your Peach; it thrives very well too of the branch or scien, which must bee cut from the top of the tree, and planted as the Olive, the earth rammed very hard about it, and prepared as before, both the stone and the scien should bee steeped for the space of twelve or foure and twenty houres in homed water; the best season to set or plant it in VIRGINIA, is in October and No∣vember. This tree will bee of admirable use there, in regard that both that and the Olive will hinder no undergrowing Corne; let neither this tree nor your Olive grow above ten foot in the stock, and in this as in Olives, if you see any branch aspiring higher then his neighbours, represse such ambition by cutting him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, other∣wise hee will divert all the sap of the tree into his owne body, and leave his fellowes in a starving and perishing condition; amongst which if you maintaine equality, they will altogether consent in gratitude to returne you a plentifull Harvest.</P>

<HEAD>An Explication of the Saw-mill, an Engine, wherewith by force of a wheele in the water, to cut Timber with great speed.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Engine is very common in Norway and Mountaines of Sweden, wherewith they cut gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at quantity of Deal-bords; which Engine is very necessary to be in a great Towne or Forrest, to cut Timber, whether into planks or otherwise. This heer is not altogether like those of Norway: for they make the piece of Timber approch the Sawes on certaine wheels with teeth; but because of reparations which those toothd wheeles are often subject unto, I will omit that use: and in stead thereof, put two weights, about 2. or 300. pound weight a piece, whereof one is marked A. the other B. The Cords wherewith the sayd weights doe hang, to be fastned at the end of the 2. peeces of mo∣ving wood, which slide on two other peeces of fixed wood, by the meanes of certaine small pulleys, which should be within the house, and so the sayd weights should alwayes draw the sayd peeces of moving wood, which advancing alway towards the Sawes rising and falling, shall quickly be cut into 4. 5. or 6. peeces, as you shall please to put on Saws, and placed at what distance you will have for the thicknesse of the planks or bords ye will cut: and when a peece is cut, then let one with a Lever turne a Rowler, wherto shall be fastned a strong

Cord which shall bring backe the sayd peece of wood, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lift again the weights: and after put aside the peece already cut, to take againe the Sawes against another peece of wood. Which once done, the ingenious Artist may easily convert the same to an Instrument of thresh∣ing wheat, breaking of hempe or flax, and other as pro∣fitable uses.</P>
