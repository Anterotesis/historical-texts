<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Long preface to a little book, is a Giants head, on a Pigmies shoulders: This shall be so short, as not to spend a line in promising bre∣vity. The following discourse really contains <HI>Magnum in parvo;</HI> being of small bulk, but treating of the greatest Subject, Government: to Au∣thorize it, I name the Author
<PB REF="4"/><HI>Charles</HI> the fifth Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> and King of <HI>Spain.</HI> That he was a person of as ex∣alted reason as quality; One Argument pertinent to the mat∣ter in hand shall serve, <HI>instar omnium,</HI> that in the height of prosperity, and flourishing in reputation, He resigned his Crowns to enjoy himself.</P>
<P>That the day after his re∣signation, was the first of his repentance, will appear to them who weigh the grandure of his spirit, and actions, a saying of more sharpness than solid truth; and Calculated to the Meridi∣an of their thoughts, who ad∣miring Crowns they never pos∣sess, make their passions the measure of other mens Actions; and conclude no man can wil∣lingly
<PB REF="4"/>part with what they so vehemently desire. But the Ge∣nius of <HI>Charles</HI> having attain∣ed these altitudes others aspire to, as the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of hu∣mane happiness; quitted them to mount into a higher sphear. The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire ruined, (as it raised) it self, and ha∣ving awed all forreign hostili∣ties into subjection, or allyance; Employed against it self, the strength and reputation of its Arms; which had not left in the world an Enemy that de∣served the honour, of falling by so vast a Power. <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth held it Greater Glory to Conquer himself, than the Na∣tions he had subdued: and find∣ing no Antagonist worthy his encounter, like the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>State, turned his force against himself; but with this diffe∣rence, that the <HI>Romans</HI> by Ci∣vil War, destroyed their Em∣pire; <HI>Charles</HI> by conquering himself, in vanquishing those ambitious passions which reign over Kings, and have Empe∣rors their vassals; by retyring from the Throne into an Ermi∣tage, obtained a Crown more Glo∣rious than that he resigned: ha∣ving divested himself of tempo∣ral honours, to fit himself for investiture in Caelestial Dig∣nities.</P>
<P>But admitting that saying as true, as 'tis smart and piquante; and that he quitted his Crowns, for fear of losing them; it de∣rogates not from the authority of his discourse, nor diminishes
<PB REF="5"/>the reputation of his wisdom. For if he had Cause to fear the loss of his Crowns, it argues greater prudence, by resignation to make an happy <HI>Exit</HI> in full felicity; than to outlive his hap∣piness, by seeing his Scepter wrested out of his hand; and the glorious day of his splen∣did triumphs, ending in the dismal Storms of War with his Son, like a new <HI>Phaeton</HI> just∣ling his Father out of the throne.</P>
<P>The Discourse is of Govern∣ment, but presumes not to in∣struct our Governours; and thought it may please the hu∣mour of the times, where Sub∣jects are more inquisitive into the duties of Soveraigns, than careful to practise their own,
<PB REF="6"/>readier to learn what Princes ought to do, then to perform what Liegemen are bound to: and like the Scribes and Pha∣rises in <HI>Moses</HI> seat, study Law and policy, to teach others, not themselves. 'Tis published to do it right, as worthy of publick view, and for publick advantage; For 'tis with men in society, as with figures in Arithmetique; they receive their value from the place they stand in: but authority thought it en∣largeth the influence, doth not change the nature of persons; as the figure that signifies a mil∣lion, is the same as when it denotes One; the greatest King∣dom, is but a Society made up of individuals, as the grea∣test numbers are composed of
<PB REF="6"/>the Digits, and the hugest vo∣lumes of the Letters of the Al∣phabet. The Emperour and his Subjects, being a grand Corpo∣ration, as a Major and Com∣monalty are a lesser, which re∣solves into that of Masters and Families; and they consist of particular persons, whereof eve∣ry one is a Corporation in him∣self; as made up of a mind to govern, and a body to obey. 'Tis a maxime in Philosophy <HI>Simplicia Compositis priorca:</HI> And the model of Civil Govern∣ment, was taken from the na∣tural, where the Soul is Sove∣raign to direct and command; and the affections and members, are subjects to obey and exe∣cute. Thus private men are Princes; and have a harder Pre∣vince,
<PB REF="7"/>than the greatest Sove∣raigns: for those lusts and pas∣sions which are private mens Subjects, have reigned over Soveraigns, and conquered Con∣querors, who bridled Nations, and governed the greatest Com∣munities.</P>
<P>These are advises to Govern a Kingdom; but by the trick of <HI>Mutatis Mutandis,</HI> what was designed only for <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Noke,</HI> may be fitted for <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Styles:</HI> and what <HI>Charles</HI> delivered for a direction to order States, may serve you for instruction to govern your self.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVICE OF <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Emperour of <HI>GERMANY,</HI> To his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Spain:</HI> Upon the Resignation of his Hereditary Crowns to his said Son.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most dear Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO Jewels appear so glori∣ous as those that embel∣lish the Crowns of Princes: Soveraignty is the Mistress to
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>which the Greatest Spirits de∣vote their Services; Making the Universe a Theatre of He∣roick Actions, to Justifie their Title to the Dignity they Af∣fect. This hath made the Re∣gal State an Object of Vene∣ration or Envy to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Inferi∣ours; and given cause to Kings to think the Earth a Stage too narrow whereon to display the Beams of their Ma∣jesty, and the Prerogatives of that Condition which hath no Equal under the Sun. This hath raised Ambition to that height, that Men trample on all Rights, Civil or Sacred, that obstruct their passage to the Throne: And even devest themselves of Humanity, in offering violence to the Laws
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>of Nature, that they may with more security put on and wear the Royal Purple; sacrificing the Lives of nearest Relations to the Interest of the Crown. Hence it is that the Examples of Quitting Crowns, and Re∣signing Scepters, are so rare, that succeeding Ages enter∣tain the Relation thereof as Fancies, rather than Historical Truths. So natural to Man is the thirst of Independant Freedom, that the Quitting of that which all desire to en∣joy, seems a Paradox not to be esteemed true in any Case, but Theirs, who by their in∣capacity to use that Excellent Priviledge, are unworthy to enjoy it; or by pretending a Voluntary Resignation, think
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>to palliate their Weakness, and hide their Disability to hold that Scepter, which if not yielded, would be wrest∣ed from them. Like those vain Sophists, who decried Riches, not out of a real Con∣tempt of them, but because they wanted them, and knew not how to gain them.</P>
<P>The value of Gifts depends much on the Knowledge or Ignorance of the Donor, in proportion to which, it rises and falls: The most magnifi∣cent Present from the hand of him that esteems it mean, be∣comes common, and lays on the Receiver an Obligation not answerable to the intrin∣sique value of the Gift, but suitable to the Estimat of the
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>Giver, which like the Princes Stamp, often makes the same Piece Currant, at a higher and lower Rate: A Wedge of Gold bestow'd by an Ameri∣can, who thinks Glass more precious, deserves only the small Acknowledgements due for a Present of Glass, not of Gold. What I have said of the Excellency of the Regal State, infers not an Alteration of my declared Resolution to Refign my Diadems to you; but that as you shall receive a Gift of the Greatest Magni∣tude, it comes from my hand, who perfectly know the tran∣scendant value of what I give. And that you may see your Obligations to me, as my Bounty to you, equally super∣lative;
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>and read my Excess of Kindness for your Person, and high esteem of your Abilities in the Character of that Love which hath engag'd me freely to transfer from my self to you the Supreme Authority, to which the Greatest Persons in past Ages, have aspired with that Ardency, and possessed with that Jealousie, that Sons, Fathers, and Brothers fell Vi∣ctims to their Passions, for Gaining or Keeping the Throne; though they, if de∣vested of that Soveraign Dig∣nity, would have redeemed with their own, the Lives of their Relations.</P>
<P>That no Man Resigns the Royal Power, but for Incapa∣city to manage, or Fear to lose
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>it, will be henceforth listed in the Catalogue of Vulgar Er∣rours, upon the convincing Evidence of my single In∣stance; who can without Va∣nity call <HI>Europe, Asia, Afri{que}</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> to testifie my Ability to sway and keep the Scepter in my hands; having fix'd so many recent Trophies of Conduct and Valour in these parts of the World, that the Antipodes must be search∣ed to find out an Enemy who may dare to attaque that Per∣son, whose Prudence and Prowess have gain'd him the Honour to be rank'd amongst the greatest Heroes.</P>
<P>Animals arrived at the years of maturity, are naturally in∣clin'd to preserve their Spe∣cies
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>by Propagation, and de∣light in the Productions of their kind: It is my desire, and will be my greatest pleasure, to see the exercise of these great Politique Vertues con∣spicuous in my Actions, conti∣nued by you; and to behold my Qualities and Dignities, as well as my Person, survive my self in you the Image of my Person, the actual Heir of my Dignities, and emulous Imita∣tor of my Examples.</P>
<P>The Sun, who in his Meri∣dian — Chariot guilds the World with glorious Beams, equally admirable as profitable to the Universe, withdraws at Night to rest in the Curtains of his beloved <HI>Thetis;</HI> that Mortals, who prize good
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>things more by Privation than Fruition of them, may be taught by the Darkness that ensues his Retirement, to wish for and receive his morning Light with due Respect: I am now resolved to confine my self to the Privacies of a Religious House, that the sud∣den Ecclipse of a Person whose Influence hath made this Empire and other States to flourish many years, may cause them to fix their Eyes on you, as the Rising Sun; and with full Acclamations promise themselves from your good Government, the continuance of that Happiness they enjoy∣ed under mine: And look up∣on you, not as <HI>Philip</HI> the Son of <HI>Charles,</HI> but as <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>Fifth, revived like a Phoenix out of his own Ashes, to re∣new the course of his youth∣ful Triumphs.</P>
<P>That you may answer their Expectations, before I Resign my Crowns into your hands, I shall give you some Directions which you are to esteem as highly as these Diadems, which have derived their Ma∣jestique Lustre on my Head, from the Rules you shall re∣ceive, more than from those Orient Diamonds that adorn them.</P>
<P>'Tis not my Intention to mind you here of those Du∣ties of Piety to God, Tempe∣rance, and Magnanimity in your Actions, and Justice to your Subjects; which are the
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>Basis of Thrones, and Pillars of Soveraignty: For that I am satisfied by your Practice, that you have heartily embra∣ced those Excellent Princi∣ples of your Education: And that whether you converse with the presēnt or past Ages, you cannot want frequent Ad∣monitions by Men or Books, to urge the exercise of those Fundamental Vertues. My Design is, to commend to your Observation some Rules and Maximes which my Experi∣ence, as Emperour and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> hath confirmed useful in the Government of those States I shall Resign into your Hands.</P>
<P>When you consider the nu∣merous Dominions you are to
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>succeed in, in <HI>Spain, Flanders, Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> with the different Constitutions and Inclinations of the People, the variety of their Laws and Politique Interests, you will presently conclude, That great Governments are great Bur∣dens; and the Prerogatives you enjoy above other Prin∣ces, are but Intimations and Marks of greater Cares and weightier Duties incumbent on you. The Cares of a Pilot are circumscrib'd within the narrow Compass of the Ship he guides; but those of an Admiral extend to the whole Fleet: The vigilance of other Princes, like the single States they Rule, is short and nar∣row; yours must be propor∣tionable
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>to your Dominions, dilated from East to West, and reach even to a New World. But that you may not be discouraged at the Troubles that attend your Greatness, Remember that as your Government is more Weighty and Large, so will your Glory be; which will run parallel with your Cares, and make you Renowned in those Remote Regions where the Names of other Princes are never heard of.</P>
<P>To advise a Great Prince to be content with the Domini∣ons he is born to, may seem ab∣surd to them who judge Con∣tentment a private Vertue on∣ly, and extol an Insatiable Ambition as the greatest Glo∣ry
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>of a King. But those Rules of Justice that prohibit Inju∣ries between private Men, do so much the more oblige Prin∣ces not to violate the Rights of their weaker Neighbours, as the Consequences of their Actions are more generally fa∣tal, involving not Families on∣ly, but Nations in Common Ruine; And as Princes, who are the Fountains, ought also to be the Examples of Justice to other Men. Besides, I look on the Empire as swell'd to that Bulk, that to adde to it, were to cram meat into a full Stomach, which will not nou∣rish the Body, but oppress the Concoctive Faculty, and render it incapable to digest the Aliment it had received
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>before. Sure I am, it will be more acceptable with God, and pleasing to men, for you to preserve the Grandeur of your Estates by good Govern∣ment, than by a wilde Ambi∣tion of New Conquests, to hazard your Hereditary Crowns.</P>
<P>The Life of a Prince is like the Body of the Sun, which draws the Eyes of all Mortals towards him, and is as conspi∣cuous as the Rays of Light: To think the bad Actions of a Prince can escape discovery, is to believe the Sun-Beams invisible. 'Tis beneath your Dignity to do any thing that may fear the Censure, or not abide the Test of the whole World. And when you re∣flect
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>upon the Jurisdiction of Princes, that it extends only to the Hands and Tongues, but reaches not the Thoughts and Conceptions of their Sub∣jects, which are exempt from Earthly Powers, and triable in that Court only where the Gods of the Earth stand at the Bar to accompt for their Acti∣ons, it will appear that though the bad Actions of a Prince may escape the Lash of his Subjects Tongues, and the violence of Revenge, they will be certainly Arraigned, Sentenc'd, and Condemned in their private Thoughts, which fear not the Rigor of Humane Laws, nor the Treacherous Malice of Informers. And the Sentences pronounced
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>there, will be readily execu∣ted, when a fit occasion pro∣mises Indempnity; and with so much the more eagerness and virulency as their former fear to express their Grievan∣ces was great: Like hidden Fires, that burst forth in more violent Eruptions. The end of this Discourse, is, to per∣swade you to such a Comport∣ment as becomes your Digni∣ty, and may satisfie your Peo∣ple that they are happy under your Conduct, by the Prote∣ction and Security they re∣ceive from your Care and Vigilance, in recompence of those Duties of Subjection and Obedience they pay you. This will beget an intire Con∣fidence on their part in your
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>Prudence and Goodness, and establish your Throne in the Hearts and Affections of your People. And though it be much controverted whether Princes are more secure in the Love or Fear of their People, I commend it to you as my sence, That the security of Government depends more on the Love than Fear of the Sub∣ject: And take it as my Advice to choose the way of sweet∣ness and Clemency to make your Throne durable, rather than that of Violence and Ri∣gor, to render your self more absolute; but withal to entail the hatred of the People on your Posterity. How fatal it hath been to Princes to press their People with excessive
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>severities, appears by those Examples, where the Tyran∣ny of the Old, forceth the People to entertain thoughts of New Masters; who are ne∣ver wanting to invite them to Disloyalty, by Promises of Ease and better Usage: And the People, willing to believe what they passionately wish, are easily perswaded to change that Condition than which they think none can be worse.</P>
<P>It is a vain Opinion, That the Security of Governours con∣sists in the Poverty or Slavery of their <HI>People,</HI> whom you must devest of Humanity, before you can render them sense∣less of those Pressures and Mi∣series that attend a needy and
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>servile Condition; nor is it possible for men under Pres∣sures and Miseries, not to de∣sire Ease and Happiness. And how frequent opportunities a Politique Body may have to attain their desires in this kind, is sufficiently illustrated by the hatred that attends Tyranny, the natural itch of Innovation, and Subtleties of Ambitious Men, who never fail to improve all occasions to raise their Fortunes on the Ruines of their Superiours.</P>
<P>It is the happiness of Prin∣ces, that the things which na∣turally procure the Love of the People, are also most wor∣thy the practice of the Prince: And that it is their Interest to exercise those Vertues which
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>they are obliged to embrace for their Native Beauty and Excellency, though Naked and Destitute of Forraign Advantages. What can more become a Prince, than the Religious observance of Faith, Continence, and Justice? And what can more endear him in the Affections of his Peo∣ple, than the practice of these Vertues, which will infallibly beget an intire Confidence in his Goodness, a hearty Kind∣ness and Love for his Govern∣ment, and a sincere Venera∣tion and Reverent Regard for his Person and State: Faith in your proceedings, and keep∣ing your Word, will gain Cre∣dit to your Promises at home and abroad; and the respects
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>due to a Generous and Noble Prince, whose Word hath some resemblance with that of God, which never deceives them that rely on it. Conti∣nence will make your Person venerable; and besides the in∣fluence of your good Exam∣ple will convince your People of the excellency of your Ver∣tue, who being above the power of Law, are a Law to your self; and by a volunta∣ry Election and generous In∣clination to Goodness, can keep within due bounds that unruly Passion which hath left a stain on the Names of the greatest Monarchs, and the Severity of Laws and Ri∣gor of Punishments cannot regulate in meaner men;
<PB N="23" REF="18"/>whom you can then freely re∣prove of those Vices, which if guilty your self, you could not without Blushing rebuke in others. Your Justice will fill your Dominions with Men of Worth and Merit, who see∣ing the Way to Honours and Preserments open only through the Temple of Ver∣tue, will become Votaries to Goodness, that they may re∣ceive from your Justice the Rewards due to excellent A∣ctions, and escape those Pu∣nishments and Disgraces your just Severity inflicts on Vice and Wickedness. These Ver∣tues will implant in your Sub∣jects Minds such Esteem for your Person, and Opinion of your Goodness, that when
<PB N="24" REF="19"/>any miscarriage in Govern∣ment happens by Injustice, or otherwise, they will impute it to the failings of your Mi∣nisters; Judging it as impossi∣ble for you to deviate from your Justice and Goodness, as the Sun to vary his constant Course.</P>
<P>The Affairs of Princes are divided between Peace and War, which have their parti∣cular Ways and distinct Rules of Management, and afford Occasions for the Exercise of different Vertues: It is the prudence of a Prince to make the one subservient to the o∣ther; and in the Sun-shine of Peace to provide for the Storms of War, which is a time of Expence, as the other
<PB N="25" REF="19"/>is of Gain: Both have proper and peculiar Arts, wherein the dexterity of a Prince is much seen, in using both to best advantage. And as the best end of War, is Peace; so a wise Prince in the Securities of a deep Peace, hath War in prospect.</P>
<P>The certain Charge that attends the Conduct of great States, is so vast, and the E∣mergencies that may require extraordinary Expence, so frequent and various, that Frugality and good Husban∣dry justly claim an honourable place in the Quire of Royal Vertues, it being impossible to act those great things that become a Prince, and make Thrones Renowned, without
<PB N="26" REF="20"/>a stock of money to supply their Occasions; the provisi∣on whereof, as it denominates a Prince frugal and prudent, so it strikes terror into his Enemies, procures respect from his Allies, reverencee from his Subjects, and lies in readiness to serve his Glory: Whereas Contempt is the in∣separable Companion of Po∣verty, though sitting in a Throne, and adorn'd with a Diadem.</P>
<P>The first step to make your self rich, is to make your Peo∣ple so; and that your Trea∣sure may be full, endeavour that theirs may abound and o∣ver-flow. Let it be your principal care to secure their Traffique, and protect them in
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>their Commerce. This, be∣sides the advantage of your Exchequer by your Customs, will win you the Affections of your People, whom nothing pleaseth more than the in∣crease of Wealth, which makes them esteem him the best Prince under whom they thrive most. The improve∣ment of their Estates is a sensi∣ble benefit and effect of your Protection, and an Argument so convincing and demonstra∣tive of good Government, that they yield a voluntary and chearful obedience to that Regiment from which they derive such real and palpable advantages; and will esteem it a Priviledge, not a Burden, to obey. When you are thus
<PB N="28" REF="21"/>become Master of their hearts, you may at a pinch command their Purses, who cannot but hold themselves obliged in good Nature and Interest, to part with a pittance to sup∣ply his Necessities, to whose Care and Protection they owe their Abundance; and may expect an increase of their store, by the Continuance of his Favour, as their denyal may incline him by remissness and neglect of their Concerns, to expose what they profess to hazard and danger; and dash all hopes of future im∣provement.</P>
<P>It will be a singular means to gain Esteem and Love from your People, if you make Provision of Necessaries a∣gainst
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>times of Dearth; And by affording them at reasona∣ble Rates for Relief of their Wants, it will appear to them that you prefer publique Sa∣tisfaction before your private Benefit: And the Reputation of your prudent Fore-sight and Care for their Good, will implant in them a solid Love for your Person, and Esteem for your Conduct, than which nothing can be of more advantage in the Course of your Affairs. No Bene∣fits leave so deep impressions as those that come seasonably for Relief of Necessities; which being a clear Evidence of your Love to your Sub∣jects, will beget a reciprocal Love from them. 'Tis vain
<PB N="30" REF="22"/>to think a Grieved People can be Courted to forget their Miseries by Sports and Pa∣stimes, or fooled out of the memory of their Sufferings, into Affection to their Op∣pressors, by Shews and Specta∣cles, which may for a moment please the fancy; but work not any other Effects than meerly superficial, as light and emp∣ty, as vain and transitory, as their Causes: The Bonds of Policy are real and ponde∣rous, and Subjection a serious thing, which affects so deeply the Hearts of Men, that no∣thing but the sensible Effects of a viligant Protection, derived to them by solid Advantages from their superiours, can make them love those Chains
<PB N="31" REF="22"/>which Nature abhors.</P>
<P>And since the Necessities of State may often force you to press your People to extra∣ordinary Supplies, by Taxes and Impositions; you are to consider that the power of a Prince depends upon his Peo∣ples Conformity to his Dire∣ctions, and uniform assent to serve and honour him. And inasmuch as nothing touches them more nearly in their E∣states and Fortunes (the Blood of the People) than the Exa∣ction of New Aids, that Gol∣den Mean which is the best Rule of Humane Actions, is to be observed accurately in these Affairs: And you are to take special heed not to strain the strings of your Power too
<PB N="32" REF="23"/>high, to prevent those Jars and Discords that usually dis∣order the whole harmony of Government on these occasi∣ons. And though in this ad∣vice I may seem to contradict my own practice, having often burdened my People with Taxes and Impositions; I have this to justifie my Asser∣tions, that I never took that Course, but forced by indis∣pensable necessities of my Wars, nor made use of it but against my Will; and that I never had encouragement from the effects it wrought in my Peoples Hearts to reite∣rate the practice.</P>
<P>To give you some Directi∣ons in a matter of so great mo∣ment; I observe that Moneys
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>are drawn by Princes from their Subjects two ways, vo∣luntary and compulsive: I call that voluntary, when the Sub∣ject does, as by Contract, re∣ceive <HI>quid pro quo</HI> from his Soveraign, in some particular Benefit, for the Money he pays; as in the sale of Offices, farming of Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Com∣pulsive, when no particular re∣compence is made by the Prince for what he receives, and the Subjects Money exa∣cted from him: for though in truth, when Taxes and Im∣positions are raised to serve Publique Necessities, and im∣ployed accordingly, the <HI>Prince</HI> is but the <HI>Peoples</HI> Steward, to dispose of their Aids for their benefit, wherein they receive
<PB N="34" REF="24"/>the recompence of their Sup∣plies: Yet these Benefits being commonly remote, general, and diffusive, pass as it were invisible and unperceived, by the particular Members of the Body politique, who are little affected with any Advantage, but what sensibly accrues to them in their private Con∣cerns. This is the reason why this later seems so harsh, and the other pleasant to the <HI>Peo∣ple;</HI> and may incline you to use this, rather than that. The Court of <HI>Rome</HI> may encourage all <HI>Princes</HI> studious of their profit, to establish the sale of Offices, as a great Help to fill their Treasures; which is clearly proved by the experi∣ence of the <HI>Papacy:</HI> for be
<PB N="35" REF="24"/>the Church never so poor in the Vacancy of the See, the succeeding Pope never fails to furnish himself abundantly in the very entrance of his reign by this single means of the sale of Offices.</P>
<P>That other way of Supply by Taxes and Impositions, is not so odious, but by dextrous management, discreet Officers, and presidents of other Coun∣treys under heavier Burdens, it may be practised without inconvenience. But it will concern the <HI>Prince</HI> by easie Access, kind Reception, satis∣factory Answers, and obliging Carriage, and by making out the Necessities that occasion this Grievance, to sweeten the Affections of the people into
<PB N="36" REF="25"/>a Belief that he hath not taken this course willingly, but com∣pelled by urgent Occurents of State, and for the defence or other advantage of his Sub∣jects. And in levying these Impositions, whether tempora∣ry or perpetual, have a watch∣ful Eye on your Officers, lest by Exactions and Violences they adde to the <HI>Peoples</HI> mise∣ries, and render them less able to furnish you another time.</P>
<P>Never impose high Customs on those things which are im∣ported or exported to serve the Necessities of the place; for in that case the moderate Custom makes the greater vent, and proves more advan∣tagious than heavy Impositi∣ons, which discourage Trade,
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>and not onely deprive the place of Necessaries for sub∣sistance, but stop the sale of those Superfluities it can spare, by the thin resort of forraign Merchants, where Great Customs devour the Gains of those that Traffique. To impose high Customs on forraign Superfluities impor∣ted, is not only just, in ma∣king them that affect those Novelties pay dear for their Fancies, but in deterring o∣thers from the vanity of ex∣pending on those Trifles the Moneys that may be otherwise better employed.</P>
<P>Allow convenient time for payment of your Taxes, and let them be gathered by ordi∣nary Officers, not new Com∣missioners,
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>whose violence commonly exasperates the people to the danger of the State. In a word, chuse ra∣ther to pawn or sell part of your Revenue to supply your Occasions, than by encreasing the peoples Burdens, to force them to a desire of Change. And when Necessity leaves no other way open, consider the nature of the places you Tax, what they can best furnish you withal; as <HI>Spain,</HI> with Money; <HI>Germany,</HI> Men; <HI>Italy,</HI> both Money and Men. Some∣times ingratiate your self with the people by a volun∣tary Remission of part of the Assessments; and let all mat∣ters of Grace flow to them immediately from your self,
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>and refer to your Ministers what is harsh and odious. Above all, see that what is so dearly purchased with the peoples groans and your dan∣ger, be brought to your Purse, and not diverted to the pri∣vate profit of your Officers. Keep Credit with the Mer∣chants, protect them in their Trade, and secure their Com∣merce; especially those of <HI>Genoa,</HI> whose Loans you will find useful in many Emergen∣cies, which may require quicker supplies than can be raised by the ordinary ways of Tax and Impositions.</P>
<P>The absolute necessity of an able Council, is evidently gathered from the impossibi∣lity of dispatching the Affairs
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>of State, by a single person, though of prodigious Abili∣ties: And that several Princes of dissolute Lives, and weak Capacities, have reigned with honour to the State, and to the satisfaction of their peo∣ple, meerly by the prudence and faithfulness of their Mi∣nisters; to whom the great∣est Princes owe most of their Glory, as the <HI>Atlas</HI>'s of their Government, on whose shoul∣ders they are triumphantly carried through the Difficul∣ties of Policy, into the Tem∣ples of Immortal Honour.</P>
<P>Your Wisdom cannot ap∣pear in any thing more, than in the choice of fit persons to serve you in your weighty Affairs, by Counsel and Exe∣cution.
<PB N="41" REF="27"/>And the better to guide your Election, think no man worthy employment un∣der you, but such whose Wis∣dom enables them to discharge their Trust to best advantage, and secure them from those Inconveniencies wherein men are involved by Ignorance and Imprudence. And lest passion or interest should incline them to employ their Talents to your prejudice; and study their own, more than your In∣terest and Honour: Your next care must be, That their Wisdom be attended with a generous Faithfulness to dis∣charge their Trust, intire Love for your <HI>Person,</HI> and a vertuous Disposition, with∣out which, it will be impossi∣ble
<PB N="42" REF="28"/>to give the people satisfa∣ction, when the scandalous Lives of your Ministers shall give them cause to suspect all their Actions, and to presage nothing but Ruine to the State from their Conduct who cannot govern themselves. Tis an excellent Secret, and one of the prime Mysteries in the Art of Government, for a <HI>Prince</HI> incapable to manage Affairs of State, to cover his Defects by employing men of Excellent Abilities, well-dis∣posed, and faithful to his Crown. The Glory of their Actions redounds to the <HI>Prince;</HI> and the people, never curious to enquire from what hand they receive their Hap∣piness, rest so well satified
<PB N="43" REF="28"/>with the Effect, that they care not to pry into the Cause, but applaud him an Excellent <HI>Prince,</HI> under whom they en∣joy peace and plenty, though perhaps he contributes little to the Felicity they live in.</P>
<P>The Advantages of Honour and Profit that attend the ser∣vice of <HI>Princes,</HI> attract multi∣tudes to seek and press for im∣ployment; but you are to re∣member that most of these men come to serve their ambi∣tious and covetous Humours, not the Interest and Honour of the State. But as I will not condemn all that catch at em∣ployment, and offer their ser∣vices, so I advise you to think your best diligence well laid out, to find men in all places
<PB N="44" REF="29"/>of your Dominions, fit to serve you; and having found them, to esteem your Trea∣sures of Wealth and Honour never better expended than in encouraging such men by am∣ple Rewards, and obliging them more strictly to your person and interest: The ra∣ther, for that the World affords numbers of excellent persons, who in private For∣tunes have princely Spirits, elevated to that pitch, that they admire not Riches or Ho∣nours, but prefer the Liberty of an obscure Retirement, be∣fore the splendid Servitude of high Employments. Yet these men, when drawn forth to appear on the Theatre of State, have acted their parts
<PB N="45" REF="29"/>with singular Dexterity, incomparable Integrity, and admired Courage. And settle it for a Maxime, That in mat∣ters of importance, a prudent and couragious Counsellor may promote your designs by his sound Advice, more than Legions of Souldiers, and whole Mountains of Treasure. And you may observe that the greatest <HI>Princes</HI> in all Ages have made choice of, and been served by the ablest Ministers; whereof <HI>Caesar,</HI> the greatest <HI>Prince</HI> in my Judgement, for Peace and War, that ever ap∣peared on the Stage of the World, is a sufficient Instance; No Age having produced a <HI>Prince</HI> equal to him, or a <HI>Prin∣ces</HI> Ministers comparable to
<PB N="46" REF="30"/>those he employ'd. The Rea∣son is obvious, <HI>Like will to like:</HI> And a gallant <HI>Prince</HI> presently discovers the Weakness of a Minister, and slights him; as a weak <HI>Prince</HI> comprehends not the Excellencies, and therefore seldom uses the Ser∣vice of an able Officer.</P>
<P>'Tis useful and necessary to observe the Genius of your Officers, and fit them with Employments suitable to their Inclinations and particular Ex∣cellencies: For a Minister who may perform Excellent Services to your Crown in <HI>Spain,</HI> if employed in <HI>Italy</HI> may prejudice your Affairs there, which are to be carried on with other Maximes, and manag'd by persons of tempers
<PB N="47" REF="30"/>different from your <HI>Spanish Mi∣nisters.</HI> In the choice of Gene∣rals and Captains of Armies, this Rule is of singular benefit, which may appear by that eminent Example of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> inferiour to none in Conduct or Success in Land-Wars, but most unhappy in Naval En∣gagements: So rare a thing is a man absolutely wise, that can at all times, in all places, and on all occasions, merit the praise of a dextrous Mi∣nister.</P>
<P>Lest the date of your Hap∣piness expire with the Lives of your able Counsellors, fail not to train up others for your service, in the life-time and under the tuition of your greatest Ministers, to be a
<PB N="48" REF="31"/>Nursery of gallant persons, whose eminent Abilities and worthy Actions, may perpe∣tuate the Felicity of your Estates. Take the Romans for your Example, who to pre∣vent the Inconvenience might ensue the leaving the stress of their great Affairs, to rely and depend on the Life of a single person, in all their Armies made provision of several able Commanders assigned to suc∣ceed in the Office of General, in case of misadventure to the person actually officiating the Chief Charge.</P>
<P>Never hazard matters of Importance in a time of dan∣ger, upon their management, who were never employed in Affairs of equal weight: In
<PB N="49" REF="31"/>which Cases you are to prefer the experience of your Anci∣ent, before the Humours of your younger Counsel∣lors.</P>
<P>'Tis a common Observation that young men are generally bold and credulous, as old men fearful and suspitious; therefore in the choice of Counsellors, respect chiefly the middle Age, as a mean be∣tween those Extreams: But rely most on their Advice, who have given proof of their sufficiency in dangerous occa∣sions, and are grown gray with the Cares of Government; whose Experience may tune the dissonant Humours of jarring Councils to a perfect Harmony: But think not I
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>exclude young or old men from your Councils, for the Common Observation like General Rules hath its excep∣tions in many Instances of young men of ripe Understan∣dings, and old ones of flouri∣shing Wits and warm Courage. I rather commend to your imitation that Roman Medley where the heat of young men was tempered by the cool and staid prudence of gray-heads, and the quintessence of both concurred in men of middle Age, who partaking of the vigorous Heat of the former, and sober Wisdom of the lat∣ter, were excellent both for Counsel and Execution, and together made up the Body of a Roman Senate.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="32"/>
<P>The Ancient Greeks, in four famous Examples, have intimated to us four special means to attain Wisdom.</P>
<P>The first by Experience: Expressed in the Story of <HI>A∣gamemnon</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> re∣presented as persons grown wise by variety of Business, and Observations gathered out of frequent Audiences, Treaties, and Consulta∣tions.</P>
<P>The second is by Histories and Memories, which in small Volumns comprehending the Transactions of many Ages, afford Instructions useful in Occurrences of the present Times, and furnish the Rea∣der with Examples of all sorts, discovering not only the mis∣carriages
<PB N="52" REF="33"/>of former Times, but the Causes of them; and shewing those Rocks on which unskilful Pilots have split the Ship of State, direct the dili∣gent Observer to steer his Course into a safe Port. This we have figured in <HI>Solon</HI> and <HI>Socrates.</HI></P>
<P>The third by Travel into forraign Countreys to mark the variety of Laws, of Policy, which may be useful in Oc∣currences at home, represen∣ted in <HI>Ʋlysses.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth in <HI>Nestor,</HI> by long Life, where one Lesson learnt yearly, swells at last to a System of Wisdom. When all these concur in one person, they make his person reve∣rend, and his Counsels Oracles.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>
<P>Nor will it be unsafe to rely on their Advice, who have joyned Historical to Experi∣mental Wisdom: And though the length of time supposed necessary to attain these seve∣ral sorts of Wisdom, seem to exclude young men from be∣ing Masters of any of them, yet a young Prince may soon attain them all, by frequent converse by the Eminent in every kind, and discreet use of their Counsels.</P>
<P>The second qualification of a Minister, is, That he be a Good Man: Where the ex∣quisit Arts of Hypocrisie, those invisible Deceits and Laby∣rinths in the hearts of Men, have made it almost impossible to pronounce a right Sen∣tence
<PB N="54" REF="34"/>without long and accu∣rate Observation of their A∣ctions: for Actions may be good in Substance and Effect, yet not denominate the Agent a Good Man, because they may be done with a bad in∣tent, or ill designs, or by ac∣cident, or may proceed from a wavering mind, not out of Love to Vertue, but to serve its Interest, or gratifie it self with more ease and security in some corrupt Lust, or vitious Practice; to promote which, the same person will by and by act things quite contrary to the good now done. He only deserves the Title of a Good Man, who having well weigh'd the Pleasures and Profits that court men to Vice,
<PB N="55" REF="34"/>makes a deliberate Election, and gives the preference to Vertuous Courses, being sa∣tisfied he hath an absolute Obligation to Truth and Goodness, devested of all Se∣cular advantages: Acts well, out of a Generous Principle, That 'tis his Duty to do so, and improves this Principle by constant Practice into an habitual Goodness: This is that fix'd immoveable Man, that <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, who must cease to be, before he can de∣viate from the Rules of Ver∣tue. Prefer this qualificati∣on in your Minister, before Riches, Favour, and all the Goods of Fortune; which if they want, let them be furni∣shed by you, in reward of
<PB N="56" REF="35"/>their Services; the rather, for that the meaner his For∣tune was whom your Bounty exalts, the stronger will the Obligation be, and his grati∣tude greater. That favour is most acceptable, which is proper and agreeable to the humour of him on whom it is bestowed: Therefore you are to dispence your Bounties in Honours, Profits, and Plea∣sures, as most suitable to their various Inclinations. And let not your Favourites or Offi∣cers deprive you of any part of that Gratitude which is due to your Bounty, which they will certainly do, if your favours flow not imme∣diately from your self, but are got upon their motion and
<PB N="57" REF="35"/>intreaty, or conferr'd by their hands.</P>
<P>Scorn to be so much your Favourites or Domesticks Servant, as to confine your self always to their Advice in what concerns your Family or Person, but use your Liber∣ty to take Counsel, where your Reason suggests the best may be had; and prefer the Considerations of Wisdom and Vertue, not onely to those of Riches and Honour, but the nearest Relations of Domesticks, or Favourites, not commended by the same qualities to your special re∣spect.</P>
<P>Cherish Emulation in your Ministers, by giving assured Hopes of Nobler Rewards to
<PB N="58" REF="36"/>the better desert, but take heed this Emulation between them proceed not to Jealousie, and perpetual Dislikes, as very prejudicial to your service in the Clashings of their Coun∣sels and Actions, and in the en∣vy that attends the Prefer∣ment of the most Meritori∣ous, which involves the Infe∣riour in perpetual Discon∣tents, and engages him to le∣vel all his Designs more to cross and lessen the others Authority, and traduce his Services, than to promote your Interest.</P>
<P>'Tis a common Error in <HI>Princes</HI> of great Parts not to consult with, or to neglect the Advice of their ablest Mi∣nisters, lest these should claim
<PB N="59" REF="36"/>a share in the Glory of their Actions, and rob them of part of that Honour which they would intirely enjoy: For since the Advice of Counsel∣lors depends so much on the Resolution of the Prince, what reason is there, but that the Prince may justly assume the intire Glory of the Action, though proceeding from his Ministers Advice; which, if not actuated by the Prince, had remained a formless im∣perfect Embryon, without Beauty or Efficacy? As the Architect carries the Honour of the Edifice, though the Model was framed with the Advice of a Labourer. Be∣sides, you may make great ad∣vantage of sounding the opi∣nion
<PB N="60" REF="37"/>of your Counsellors, without imparting to them the Secret of your Designs.</P>
<P>What is said of Counsellors, will be of use in your choice of Governours of Provinces, Towns, and Places of strength. I will adde onely this, That I hold it most se∣cure for the Prince to grant such Offices for some short time only, to prevent the dan∣ger of making Parties, and car∣rying on disloyal Designs; which the Opportunities of a long continuance in Office may tempt ambitious Spirits to. Nor can frequent Chan∣ges of this kind displease the People, who are naturally ad∣dicted to Novelty, and apt to nauseate things accustomed,
<PB N="61" REF="37"/>though never so Good.</P>
<P>Easie Access, and free Au∣dience, are great Obligations to the Commons; especially when you apply Remedies to the Grievances they complain of; and by the same means you will gain great Know∣ledge and Experience in busi∣ness, and an insight into a thousand Designs, which o∣therwise you had never heard of.</P>
<P>The like, and many other good effects will attend the Progresses you are to make in∣to the several parts of your Dominions; but take heed the frequency of them render them not contemptible, nor the Charge burdensom to your Subjects. As they must
<PB N="62" REF="38"/>not be too long intermitted, lest hope of impunity move your Deputies and Magi∣strates to oppress the People, and their hopes of Relief from the presence of their Prince, be extinguished.</P>
<P>Receive Petitions courte∣ously, hear patiently, express Compassions to those in mise∣ry, and endeavour that none may depart unsatisfied from your presence. See that the Power of Great Ones weigh not down the Right of the Poor. And in giving of Judg∣ment, respect not for the time, the good or ill report of the Persons, but the merits of the Cause. Confer Offices of Ju∣dicature on Persons of Learn∣ing and Integrity. And to en∣gage
<PB N="63" REF="38"/>them to discharge their Duties well, give them cause to believe that the first step to higher Dignities, is to behave themselves well in the lower.</P>
<P>Conscience and Charity o∣blige to a special regard of Churches, Orphans, Widows, Prisoners, Captives, and all Persons in misery and necessi∣ty; fail not to relieve them with expedition in their Cau∣ses. And settle it in your mind as an undoubted Truth, That God, who judges all without respect of Persons, hath declared himself pro∣pense and ready to hear the Cries of the Distressed, and will certainly punish those Kings and States, where such
<PB N="64" REF="39"/>Causes are slighted, or sacri∣ficed to Power or Affection: Which I could clear to you by Examples in the compass of my Experience; but that your Piety and Tenderness of Conscience make it superflu∣ous to adde more on this point.</P>
<P>The like expedition is to be used in the Causes of Mer∣chants and other men, who lose more by spending time in attending the tedious and chargable formality of <HI>Courts,</HI> than the matters in difference amount to in value.</P>
<P>Dispatch in person what Causes you can, the rest refer to your Officers; to whom you are for expedition to as∣sign severally their proper Tasks.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="39"/>
<P>In capital matters, temper Severity with Lenity, and incline rather to absolve a sus∣pected Criminal, than con∣demn an Innocent Person, but let not your Lenity be so ex∣cessive, as to encourage Of∣fenders. Weigh seriously the circumstances of Persons, Times, and Places; and hold not your self so obliged to the strict observance of the dead Letters of your Laws, but that on just grounds you may dispense with the Rigor of those punishments they in∣flict. Frame your Proceed∣ings by the <HI>Lesbian</HI> Rule, ply∣able to the variety of Circum∣stances; for then only the people have just cause to com∣plain that Justice is not equal∣ly
<PB N="66" REF="40"/>administred against Crimi∣nals, when they see the same Crime in several persons une∣qually punished, but cannot discern any Reason of the di∣versity.</P>
<P>However, have such respect to the majesty of your Laws, that the power of Dispensa∣tion may remain in your self incommunicable to any, but by special Commission on weighty Occurrences: And in these Cases, Governours of States are the best Judges to moderate Laws, who see those Reasons to incline them, which pass the Knowledge, and exceed the Capacity of ordinary Advocates: But be sure this moderation arise out of a Right in Equity,
<PB N="67" REF="40"/>not Errour in Affection.</P>
<P>Let no Service done you pass unrewarded; at least in good words, which may beget an expectation of real Benefit, when time serves. Be not cu∣rious to inquire into the pri∣vate Actions of your Subjects, but let it satisfie you that they live conformable to your Laws, without scandal and ma∣nifest offence to the majesty of your Government. Leave secret faults to his Judgement who searches the heart, and sees all things: What reason is there our hands should exe∣cute, where the Eye cannot pierce. Beware of prejudi∣cate Opinions, and ever re∣serve an Ear for the other side in matters of complaint:
<PB N="68" REF="41"/>Encourage not undue Practi∣ces by too much Facility, nor discourage just Addresses by a Rigor that may preclude all expectation of Reason from you of your proceedings.</P>
<P>Never pass sentence in Cho∣ler, or any other perturbation, lest you give just Cause, as <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> of Appeal from your self, blinded with Passion, to your self seeing with the Eye of Reason.</P>
<P>Let the Guards of your Person be so kept about you, that it may appear done more to set forth the majesty of Government, than out of any necessity to secure your Life.</P>
<P>To use Princely Garments sometimes, begets Reverence
<PB N="69" REF="41"/>for your Person, and strikes Awe into the Multitude; but generally to wear a plain Ha∣bit fitted to the Mode of the Country, procures much love; the Subject being much plea∣sed to observe in their Prince a careless contempt of those Complements in which others vainly place their principal felicity: Observe the like Rule in your Diet; neither incurring hatred from the people by Excess and Pro∣fuseness; nor Contempt, by sinking too near the condition of a Subject.</P>
<P>To conclude this point, the time of Peace is most fit for adorning Cities, repairing High-Ways and Bridges, ma∣king Rivers Navigable, build∣ing
<PB N="70" REF="42"/><HI>Churches,</HI> Hospitals, Guild-Halls, reforming Abuses in Religion, visiting Universities, <HI>Colledges,</HI> and <HI>Courts</HI> of Justice, Education of Orphans, Marri∣age of poor Maids, Redemp∣tion of Prisoners, and other Works of publique Benefit, which will oblige the People to Love and Thankfulness, re∣main Monuments to Posterity of your Goodness, and happy Reign, and crown you with Eternal Glory.</P>
<P>As the Tempests and Storms of blustering Winter, do by natural Revolution succeed the serene and calm Summer Season; So the tranquility of the securest Peace, does by the Politique Vicissitude and Circulation of Affairs, end in
<PB N="71" REF="42"/>the Troubles of War, by a necessity immutable as the Laws of Nature. But my present Business is not to de∣monstrate the Truth of this Sepeculation, but to direct your Conduct in Military Bu∣siness, by Rules approved by my long experience in several Wars of greatest importance.</P>
<P>The Skill of a Pilot is not seen in the Halcyon Dayes of fair Weather, when a rude Seaman in a Cock-Boat can lead a Dance for a whole Fleet to sport securely on the smiling Ocean; but when the angry Marine Gods in a scorn∣ful defiance, swelling their huge Waves unto the Clouds, threaten to throw back those Waters into the face of <HI>Jove,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="43"/>which he had showred down to make a disdained Addition to the liquid Element. The Ship of State is easily guided in Times of Peace, when all Discontents are husht into an intire Obedience to the Laws, and no Disturbance nor Con∣tention appears, but what ari∣ses out of Mens Emulation to conform to their Princes Wills: To steer an even and steddy Course to your desired Port, through the Audaci∣ous Tumults of Popular In∣surrections confronting your Authority, the violences of Forraign Enemies, who at∣taque your Power; as it will try your Prudence and Cou∣rage, so it is always attended with the Glory due to an ex∣cellent
<PB N="73" REF="43"/>Conduct, and will crown your Head with the Immortal Lawrels of a Trium∣phant Conquerour.</P>
<P>Directions are so much the more necessary for the Affairs of War, than Peace, as the ac∣cidents of War are more vari∣ous and unexpected, the Con∣duct thereof more uncertain, and subject to alteration on all sudden Occurrences; and the Errors irrecoverable, or not to be redeemed without much Damage and Inconveni∣ence: Nor can a Prince give better proof of his Vertue and Goodness, than by Mo∣deration in time of War, when Custom seems to tole∣rate, and Power tempts him to all licentiousness, when
<PB N="74" REF="44"/>Ambition prompts him to break through the Spider Web of Legal Bonds, and scorn any Rule of his Desires or Actions, but the Dictates of his Will; And his Sword promises security against the weak opposition of the tame Arts and unarmed Rights of Peace.</P>
<P>As the Majesty of your Em∣pire will certainly expose you to the Envy of Christian States, the Jealousie of the Turk, and the Enmity of both; So it will render War a matter not of Conveniency only, to purge your Domi∣nions of those superfluous hu∣mours that may molest, and corrupt Members which may destroy so great a Body, but
<PB N="75" REF="44"/>of absolute necessity for your Interest, that you may never be unprovided of powerful Forces and expert Comman∣ders, to serve your designs of inlarging your Empire, and to secure you against all Attempts os Forreign Power, and rebel∣lious Subjects, to which so great and divided a Dominion as yours, is as subject by the various Humours, Inclinati∣ons, and Interests of its Mem∣bers, and the busie Arts of your Neighbours, as the Re∣gion of the Air to storms and tempests, by the bustling vio∣lences of Winds and Vapours. Besides, there is just cause to fear that the disuse of Arms, will no less weaken and cor∣rupt the Body Politique, than
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>want of motion the Elemental Substances: And it will be very difficult to bring them back to endure patiently the Hardships of War, who have drunk deep of the delicious Nectar of Ease and Rest, and enjoyed the soft Pleasures of Peace, or to keep them with∣in the Bounds of Civil Laws, who have been long used to the Licentiousness of War: For as Martial Discipline seems too rigid and severe to those, so the Experience of several great Monarchies hath confirmed, that the Threats of Humane Edicts cannot deterr them from pursuing their Lusts in despite of Laws, the first Principle of whose Pro∣fession, is, <HI>Not to fear;</HI> and
<PB N="77" REF="45"/>whose Conversation with Death the King of Terrors, hath made the Loss of Life so familiar and contemptible, that like them who by con∣stant use of Poysons, have exempted themselves from the fatal effects thereof; Those Capital Punishments which appear to others as Bug-bears to fright them from transgres∣sing the Limits of their Du∣ties, have no operation on their tougher Constitutions, who having often exposed their Lives to utmost perils, meerly to serve the interests of their Leader, will not scruple to hazard them to please themselves.</P>
<P>The Jealousie of his Equals, the emulous ambition of his
<PB N="78" REF="46"/>potent Officers, and the suspi∣cious Capricchio's of inferi∣our Subjects, oblige a Prince to be always on his Guard with his Sword in Hand, to prevent those Injuries which unprovided Security will in∣vite them to offer him. And to compleat your Glory in matters of War, five things are chiefly requisite; Armies, Forts, Garrisons, Provisions, and Knowledge of the Na∣ture of Places, and Humours of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>It was the Custom of the Romans in the height of their Power, and is now the Turk∣ish Custom to bring prodigi∣ous numbers of men into the field: but the great Victories the Romans obtained before
<PB N="79" REF="46"/>with small numbers against vast multitudes of the barba∣rous Nations, And the Con∣quest of <HI>Asia</HI> by those few Troops which made up <HI>Alex∣anders</HI> Army, do clearly de∣monstrate that huge Bodies of Armed men are more for show than service; more fit for ostentation, as Marks of Pow∣er, than requisite to bring Enterprizes to effect; which they obstruct more by their confused multitudes, than they promote by their seem∣ing strength; Experience ha∣ving taught us, That the grea∣ter part were Spectators only, not Actors in the Battel. This hath induced me to concur with the Modern Captains in their opinion, That thirty
<PB N="80" REF="47"/>thousand Foot and four thousand Horse, or there∣abouts, may stand for a com∣pleat Army, without Excess or Defect, as a Number requi∣sit to serve the Designs of a Prince, and sufficient for the greatest Undertakings, easier disciplin'd, paid, and provi∣ded for, than greater Bodies, most agreeable to the Modern Art of War. And as the Vi∣ctories obtained by such rea∣sonable Forces are more ho∣nourable, so in truth 'tis rare to see a place so free from Ditches, Rivers, Woods, Lakes, Mountains, and other Impediments, as to be capa∣ble of a greater Number in Battel Array.</P>
<P>Besides, We see that the
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>Turk lays the stress of his Battels, and builds the Glory of his Victories, not on those infinite multitudes which swell his Camp, but on the Valour and Experience of those few Regiments of <HI>Jani∣zaries</HI> that attend him, as <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> placed more confidence in his tenth Legion than in all the rest of his Army, though the far greater Num∣ber and no mean Souldiers. And as <HI>Caesar</HI> notwithstanding the detriment by Battel and other Accidents, did by con∣stant supplies preserve that Legion always intire, so must a Prince take care by new for∣ces to make up the number of those Companies which the fate of War, the necessity of
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>Garrisons, or other Occasions, shall withdraw from his Army, which must be maintained in the full number we have pre∣scribed. And supplies of new men may be rationally thought to increase the Gal∣lantry of an Army, in that their want of experience makes them run more boldly into those dangers which the try'd Souldier cunningly de∣clines, or meets with cau∣tion.</P>
<P>Next the proportion of your Army, the Discipline of your Camp claims your dili∣gence: And herein be sure to establish such Rules that the Principles of Religion and Justice, may flourish there, that your Souldiers may pay
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>the Duty they owe to God, who is Lord of Hosts, and to themselves in a vertuous and honest Life, which must be attended with obedience and due respect to their General and all subordinate Officers: To effect this, encourage the Dutiful by Rewards and Ho∣nours, and punish the Stub∣born and Contumacious by Disgraces and Rigorous Cor∣rections. Stifle Mutinies in the Birth by sharp Executions, as the best means to make impressions in Souldiers hearts, whom Rhetorique makes more insolent. Soul∣diers, as other men, have times of leasure and vacation from the Exercises of the Camp; therefore to prevent the en∣trance
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>of Sloth and Idleness, 'tis the Generals part to invent such Divertisements as may by constant imployment secure them from those Vices, and withal render Military En∣gagements more familiar, and so less formidable to them. The duty of a Souldier is to obey willingly, and execute readily the Commands of his Officer: And that of a Com∣mander is to act with Cou∣rage, Discretion, and Faith∣fulness, to win them to a prompt obedience by Good Words, (as <HI>Caesar</HI> call'd them Fellow-Souldiers) and by care of their Persons, Rela∣tions, Credit, and Interest, which will oblige them upon occasion to humble Acknow∣ledgements
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>and real Grati∣tude.</P>
<P>When you have thus settled the proportion and Discipline of your Army, you cannot rationally presume of success in your enterprizes, without good Rules and Orders for fight; which though they va∣ry in this of War, as in other Arts, according to the diffe∣rent circumstances of Action; yet Maximes grounded on Reason and Experience will fit a man to use all occasions to best advantage: I have of∣ten observed a great disorder in the Modern Discipline, and had an earnest desire to re∣dress it, which will appear to you by my large Collection of Notes to that purpose;
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>but could never obtain lea∣sure from my Great Employ∣ments to perfect my Design, which may deserve the Pains of so great a Prince as you to compleat: The disorder is, That our Battels and Squa∣drons are marshalled in a di∣rect Line, every particular Man, and the Ranks in gene∣ral standing directly behind one another; so that 'tis im∣possible for the first to retreat without disturbance to the next Ranks: And thus the full strength and effect of the Army, depends on the three or four first Ranks of the Bat∣tel. My design was, to find out a method whereby the first Rank being forced to re∣tire might not bear upon the
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>second, nor the second upon the third; but that the hin∣der Ranks might without dis∣order or disturbance readily step forward into the place of the wearied men, and at once relieve them and engage the Enemy; so that no inconve∣nience may befall the Army upon the Retreat of the first Ranks; which I look as the chief Perfection of the Roman Discipline. To effect this, my project was, to divide the Vantguard-Battel and Rere∣guard into three Squadrons, one to anothers side in a Tri∣angular Form; the first to re∣present the point, the other two the sides; for being thus dis-joyned and severed by Art, it were easie to bring
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>forward the second to fight, without disturbing the first; and the third, without disor∣dering the other two: Whereby, besides other Ad∣vantages, the fortune of the Field will be thrice attempt∣ed in one Encounter. And from this rough draught of the Design, you may proceed to an exact Method how these Squadrons being sub-divided into smaller, may relieve one another with like Advantage, which Experience must per∣fect.</P>
<P>Another Errour in the Mo∣dern Discipline, is, That the best Souldiers are put in the first Ranks; whereby it comes to pass that if these begin to shrink and give back, the rest
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>by their example do the like, as if it were their Duty to imi∣tate their Betters even in bad Actions; which hath been the Ruine not only of Companies and Regiments, but intire Armies: And herein the Ro∣mans are worthy imitation, who placed in the Front those they called <HI>Hastati,</HI> or Pike∣men, consisting of young men of greatest strength and courage, mixed with a third part of old Souldiers, to tem∣per the heat, and direct the valour of the Youth; in the second Squadron, called <HI>Prin∣cipes,</HI> were two parts of old experienced Souldiers, and a third of young: The third called <HI>Triarii,</HI> was intirely made up of the most expert
<PB N="90" REF="52"/>and couragious in the Army. By this excellent Order it came to pass, that not only the first on-set of the Roman Ar∣my being made by the warm Blood and emulous Courage of their choicest Youth, was violent and impetuous, and their Defence vigorous a∣gainst the most brisk Assaults; but that if at any time they gave back or were repulsed, the second Squadron was rea∣dy to sustain the shock with greater Bravery; and upon their Retreat, the <HI>Triarii</HI> suc∣ceeded to maintain the fight, with assured hopes of Victo∣ry, to beat off those Enemies who could not but be ex∣treamly weakned by the Va∣lour of the <HI>Hastati,</HI> and expert
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>Courage of the <HI>Principes.</HI> This Order I approve of, as of greatest use. And though the high Reputation of the Ro∣man Arms may by their great and long success in War, justi∣fie the imitation of their Dis∣cipline without further Rea∣son; yet 'tis obvious to eve∣ry Eye on what solid Grounds of Prudence this Order was established, and that of the Greek <HI>Phalanges</HI> marshalled in direct Lines rejected by the Romans, who though they re∣ceived the Rudiments of War from the Greeks, became greater Proficients in the Art than their Teachers; making themselves Masters of the one and the other, by conquering <HI>Greece</HI> with those Arms the
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>use whereof they derived from the Grecians. Another Argument for Collateral Squadrons, is, That the <HI>Pha∣langes</HI> or Ranks marshalled in a direct Line, are subject to greater Execution by the Enemies Artillery, which scours all that stands before it in a strait Line. Besides many other Observations which you will find scattered in my Notes for your dire∣ction in this and other points of War.</P>
<P>Nothing can render your Name more Illustrious than the Glory of perfecting this project for the better order∣ing of Forces in Battel. But let not your Employments at Land, make you forget that
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>the Sea is part of your Domi∣nion: Provide stores of all necessary Implements for Fleets; Let your Vessels be well rigg'd, mann'd, and em∣ploy'd in the service of the State, and augmented to that number that may be sufficient to serve your Designs, with∣out depending upon your Neighbours or Subjects. And never admit any Vessel into the List of your Fleets, but such only wherein you have propriety: For private men are so wedded to their parti∣cular Interest, that upon the appearance of danger their study is to preserve their Ves∣sels, though to the Ruine of the State.</P>
<P>Cause your Forts to be
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>often viewed, their works frequently surveyed, and see them repaired and improved where requisite; and the Stores fill'd with all necessa∣ries. Provide faithful, expert and couragious Governours, and trusty Souldiers: The Accidents of Death, Sickness, and loss of men, will prompt you to exceed in number, ra∣ther than fall short; but make choice of such as may give you cause, with the Romans, to rely more on the Valour of your Souldiers, than the strength of the place, though never so well fortified by Art and Nature. Let your Forts on the Frontier be few but strong. When you are assaul∣ted, rather meet your Enemy
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>bravely in the Field, than coop your self up in a Garri∣son. When you are the Ag∣gressor, choose to annoy the Enemy by Forts and Sconces raised for that purpose; and not with intolerable expence of Moneys and Time, and loss of Men, to sit down before his places of strength, which sel∣dom recompence your pains in the taking. In erecting Forts take your Model from the na∣ture of the place, and apply your Industry to make the whole proportionable to the parts, and the parts to the whole. And though no place can be impregnable, make yours of that strength that may deprive the Enemy of hopes to take them without a
<PB N="96" REF="55"/>tedious siege, great loss of men, vast expence, and other disadvantages that attend those difficult Enterprizes.</P>
<P>The Provisions of War are Victuals, Artillery, Ammuni∣tion, Supplies, and Coyn; which are then sufficient when the quantity seems to maintain an Army in a capacity to per∣form any Martial Attempt; which had my weighty Occa∣sions permitted, I had reduced to a certainty. My project was, to raise a Gallant Army composed of <HI>Flemins, Ger∣mans, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> to be kept in constant exercise against the Turk and Chri∣stian Princes whom Danger or Interest should oblige me to engage with. For their
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>Maintenance I design'd to ca∣pitulate with them, That all Booties belonging to the ad∣verse State, as Artillery, Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be intirely mine and my Succes∣sors, and all private Spoils to be distributed among the Souldiers; yet so, as to oblige them at reasonable Rates to sell to an Officer to be appoin∣ted to that purpose; such Garments, Victuals, and other things of that nature, as were not necessary for present use, which should be stored up by him, and sold again to the Souldier upon occasion with some profit to me. This had been of great conveniency to me, but more to the Souldier, in having at hand all Necessa∣ries
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>to supply his wants, at cheaper Rates than he could expect to receive them from those who follow the Camp to raise their fortunes, and make unreasonable Gains by excessive Prices.</P>
<P>This done, my intention was, to constitute an Officer to receive and secure such Moneys or Goods as the Soul∣dier upon apprehension of any dangerous Service, or other consideration, should deposit with him; and to be answer∣able for the same to the Soul∣dier, his heirs and assigns with allowance of a reasonable gain at so much <HI>per cent.</HI> for the use, with Provision that the goods of such as died without Heirs, should according to the course
<PB N="99" REF="56"/>of the Civil Law, belong to the Chamber of the Prince, and the like Constitution for such as departed intestate: and what Souldier in the Army, whether private or in Com∣mission, would not prefer the securing of his Goods, where he, his Heirs or Assigns should certainly receive them, before the exposing them to the ha∣zard of Loss by the Enemy, and other Accidents? And to defray the charge of Carriage requisite for such things, al∣lowance should have been made by the Souldier out of the Gains to come to him from the Use. This Course will be of great Advantage to the Prince, who may make consi∣derable profit of the Moneys
<PB N="100" REF="57"/>remaining in the hands of his Officers on this Account, to supply his Occasions for pay∣ment of his Army, and other necessary Charges, without injury to to the Proprietors: And besides this, it will se∣cure the dependance of the Army upon him, the things deposited being good Pledges of their Loyalty, and serve as an inexhaustible Mine of Treasure, by the Moneys and Goods of those that die with∣out heirs and Intestate, or forfeit them by Disloyalty.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the recei∣ved Opinion that Moneys are the Sinews of War, you may believe it on my Experience, that it conduces much to the strength of an Army well ap∣pointed
<PB N="101" REF="57"/>in all other things, but is far less necessary than good Discipline, Courage, Experience, and other Condi∣tions requisite in well-order∣ed Troops, and indeed of no efficacy in point of War where these are wanting. There∣fore think your self more obliged to provide able Lea∣ders, expert Souldiers, and good Orders for your Forces, than Moneys; the reason is, That such an Army under the Conduct of a valiant and pru∣dent General, can never want means to maintain it self by Pillage and Victuals, to be gained even in the heart of their Enemies Countrey. And though Provisions may be sometimes scant, the bare Pro∣mises
<PB N="102" REF="58"/>of Pay and Rewards from a Prince in Reputation with his Army for Power to perform, and for keeping his Word, will keep them in heart in the greatest Difficulties. 'Tis true, the nature of War is such, whether offensive or defensive, and the Charge so excessive, that without some help 'twere impossible for a Prince to bear it; but the Courses intimated before, and the Booty of rich Towns and Cities to be gained by Sieges or Stratagems, will render it tolerable and easie: And it must be your Care to make the War contribute to the mainte∣nance of it self, by employing your Forces in Actions atten∣tended with Profit as well as
<PB N="103" REF="58"/>Honour, and declining all useless and unprofitable En∣terprizes.</P>
<P>Mortality and other Acci∣dents common to Man, make it impossible for an Army to subsist long intire in the same State without Supplies; in order to which, you are to cause frequent Musters to be made in all Places of your Dominion, fit to yeild Supplies of men, and Regi∣sters to be kept of all the Youth able to bear Arms, where it may be done with∣out apparent danger to the State by Tumult and Insurre∣ction. And as your old Soul∣diers must be preserved from Sloth by constant Exercises, so must the Youth that is to
<PB N="104" REF="59"/>supply the Camp, be trained by sufficient Leaders, for the Service of the War. In your choice, prefer those who are naturally addicted to Arms; and amongst them, chiefly those who have Lands, Goods, or Relations to secure their Loyalty to your Crown, and implant in them a greater fear of shame or punishment, than can be expected from them who carry all their Inte∣rests in their Persons, and have nothing to care for but their own safety: But never press any man upon whom the subsistance of a Family de∣pends, but such onely who may be spared without great inconvenience, whom you are to encourage with hopes of
<PB N="105" REF="59"/>Honour and Profit by the War.</P>
<P>The Dominions you suc∣ceed in, are so many and po∣pulous, that they will easily furnish you with means to raise and maintain a potent Army according to the Rules I have shewed; And if you keep good Correspondence, and preserve the Amity esta∣blished between Us and our Allies of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> you will, besides the <HI>Flemish, Italian,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nati∣ons, have the <HI>Germans</HI> at your Devotion, who are a mighty and a brave People; and make your self formidable to the greatest Powers on Earth: Whereas if you be at Discord with your Kinsmen of that
<PB N="106" REF="60"/>House, it will impair your Authority, encourage your Enemies, weaken your Pow∣er, and cool the Affections of your ancient Friends. Above all, have due regard, and ex∣press extraordinary respect for your Cousin the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> as a person of so much worth, that the greatest Empires are too narrow for the exercise of his Excellent Vertues. And observe it as a Maxime, That though matter of unkindness may sometimes fall out between the nearest Relations; yet more good may be hoped from the Love that springs out of Consanguinity, than the fairest pretences of Amity from a Stranger: And that it is more glorious to pre∣serve
<PB N="107" REF="60"/>the Good Will and Friendship of your Kindred, by yeilding to them in some things to end differences, than by Arms to force Stran∣gers to a Compliance with your Will.</P>
<P>To conclude this point of training Youth, please their Humour, and encourage their love to War by Priviledges of wearing Weapons, and ex∣emption from the burdens of Civil Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Study an exact knowledge of the situation and nature of all places under your Go∣vernment, wherein their abundance consists, and where their defects; supply these, and use the other as a means to establish Amity between the
<PB N="108" REF="61"/>several Members of your Em∣pire, making the Abundance of one part to fill up the De∣fects of the other: Cause Plots to be drawn of all their Places of strength, Moun∣tains, Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That by resorting to your Map, you may upon occasion order mat∣ters with more certainty.</P>
<P>Think it worth your pains to inquire not only into the Humours and Dispositions, but the Interests, Alliances, and Factions of your potent Sub∣jects, for the Balance of Au∣thority remaining in your Hand, you may easily make that side most weighty and considerable that is best affe∣cted to your service, and pre∣vent all disorders that may
<PB N="109" REF="61"/>ensue upon their engagements in Parties against one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>If any of your Countreys stand in danger of a Confi∣ning Enemy, secure them from injury by your provi∣dence. And when you have an exact account of their In∣clinations, Power, Alliances, Interests, Wants, Stores, Cu∣stoms, Affections, Commodi∣ties, Incommodities, and De∣pendancies, use all to your best advantage: Then consi∣der the State and Power of those you esteem your Friends, or stand Neuters in the Quarrel: Weigh well the Persons, Places, Times, Na∣tures, Customs, Neighbours, Officers, Adherents, and other
<PB N="110" REF="62"/>siderations incident to the Af∣fairs of your Foes and Friends. For nothing conduces more to a happy Victory, than a perfect knowledge of your own and your Enemies Abili∣ties, and a prudent use of that Knowledge. Be sure you ne∣ver quarrel a great Potentate for relief of such whose weak∣ness will rather endanger than assist your Crown, unless it appear that their Ruine may turn to your Inconveni∣ence.</P>
<P>In War, who spends most, makes least waste: Never en∣gage in a Quarrel but on just Grounds, and with prudent forecast of the Event; but when engaged, assure your self 'tis never safe to dally or
<PB N="111" REF="62"/>delay. Make Provision ever in the best time, and of more than may seem necessary, for the loss in the over-plus can be but small; and though it were great, can bear no pro∣portion with the danger of of hazarding the greatest un∣dertakings by want or scarci∣ty: Victory is the mark of the Art Military, and re∣quires in the beginning Wis∣dom, Diligence, and Vigi∣lance; in the pursuit, Cou∣rage, and Perseverance: Ra∣ther assault first, than stay till you are set upon, and lose the advantages of making War in your Enemies Countrey: If your Enemy prevent you herein, make Good your De∣fence, and by all means endea∣vour
<PB N="112" REF="63"/>by diversion to force him to retreat. Repose not the whole confidence of success in your Armies at Land, nor Fleets at Sea, which are sub∣ject to great uncertainties, as the Waves that bear them; but think Prudence and Cou∣rage the best means for Victo∣ry; and remember that at Sea commonly the greater Num∣ber prevails <HI>Caeteris Paribus.</HI> But for your further Instructi∣ons in matter of War, I refer you to my Notes, which will afford you Rules for all Occa∣sions. And now I shall apply my discourse to the Enemies you are to grapple with, that you may perceive my sence of their several Condi∣tions, and your Conduct in
<PB N="113" REF="63"/>your Wars against them.</P>
<P>The Turk is your greatest and most certain Enemy, both on the Account of Religion, which you are to prefer be∣fore all other Interests; and that the violent Constitution of his Tyrannical Government keeps him always on his Guard, to secure his Power against sudden Attempts; and so his Forces are ever in readi∣ness to be poured where hope of success invites him, who de∣sires no other Cause of Quar∣rel. When I consider the long course of <HI>Danubius,</HI> and the great Champaign of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> the situation of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and Neighbourhood of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> with the Power of the Neighbours on the one side,
<PB N="114" REF="64"/>and the desert Condition of the Borders on the other, I am induced to believe that he will wave the prosecution of his Conquests there for the present, and bend his Forces against the Islands, and your States in <HI>Italy,</HI> which he will assault before he breaks with <HI>Venice;</HI> the reason is, That if he fall on the Venetian first, he may expect greater Oppo∣sition by such Auxiliary For∣ces as you may send in their Aid; but need not fear the Venetians engagement against him in your Quarrel in a time of peace with them, as well for that all Republiques, whe∣ther Aristocratical or Demo∣cratical, flattering themselves with hopes of a perpetual sub∣sistance,
<PB N="115" REF="64"/>do naturally decline all hazardous Undertakings; especially when the Tranqui∣lity they enjoy, and dangers of Action, represent every Alteration for the worse. Be∣sides the plausible pretext of keeping their Faith inviola∣ble, and the necessary depen∣dance of the <HI>Venetian</HI> on the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire in point of Traffique; and the reasons they have of being satisfied with their new Acquest of the Isle of <HI>Candy</HI> from the Turk.</P>
<P>The Turkish Empire hath its period, but known only to God; and 'tis in vain to ex∣pect his Fall by Miracles from Heaven, which must be effe∣cted by sound Policies and
<PB N="116" REF="65"/>strength of Armed Men. The poor effects Experience hath shewed of an Universal League and Combination of Christians against the Turks, afford you this Rule, That while men manage the Affairs of the World, they will often sacrifice the best Cause and nearest Concerns of true In∣terest, to Humours and Passi∣ons; whereof you have a pregnant instance in the beha∣viour of the French King on a causless Jealousie in the mat∣ter in hand. This makes me conclude it a common Errour that the excessive Power of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> is to be humbled rather by the United Forces of several Princes, who cannot but have several Designs and
<PB N="117" REF="65"/>several Interests, than by the strength of one mighty Po∣tentate, whose Designs are like his Person, single and in∣tire, and his Interest one and the same. This great Work seems reserved for you, as the greatest Prince of the Chri∣stian Profession; and with the Aid of your Allies of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> of suffici∣ent Ability to encounter that Pagan Giant; but not with∣out a serious Consideration of the most proper means to at∣tain your ends, by such ways as sound experimental Wis∣dom shall direct.</P>
<P>And first what War is most available against him, Defen∣sive or Offensive, by Preven∣tion or by Diversion? As for
<PB N="118" REF="66"/>Defensive War, nothing but pure Necessity can justifie the choice of it; being the most unprofitable, uncomfortable, and dangerous, as that where∣in we do but expose and lay our selves open to the injuries of Hostility, to the manifest consumption of our strength, and to the apparent danger of our whole Interest, without hope of Restitution of Loss, or Reparation of Damages.</P>
<P>The impossibility of ma∣king the Preparations requisit for an Offensive War, without the knowledge of the Turk, and finding him on his guard, may disswade you from that course; as the multitude of Forces he maintains in con∣stant pay, and always in readi∣ness,
<PB N="119" REF="66"/>anticipates all Designs to molest him, by preventive Wars, or by way of Diver∣sion; so that my Advice is, To avoid the simple kinds of War, and to resolve on a mixt, Defensive in appear∣ance, but Offensive in act; which if wisely managed, may by degrees of Prevention and Diversion, be at length con∣verted into a pure Offensive; which must be effected more by slights and stratagems, than plain force, against this po∣tent Enemy: And to his pur∣pose you will find frequent Opportunities by the Trou∣bles and Encombrances of his other Wars, his Losses, and the Disorders of his Camp, and the Discord about the
<PB N="120" REF="67"/>succession of the Empire. But rely chiefly on the favour of God, which is partly pro∣cured by the use of means ap∣proved by humane Discreti∣on, as conducing most to the ends we aim at; and there∣fore you are to preserve the Affections of your Allies of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> to your Person and Interest. And as the state of their Affairs can∣not but oblige them to a strict Correspondence and Amity with you for the better At∣chievement of their Enter∣prizes; so you are to believe that to maintain Friendship and Good Intelligence with them, will not only strengthen your Interest in general, but is of absolute necessity in
<PB N="121" REF="67"/>order to Success against the Turk.</P>
<P>Accompt that your best time of war with the <HI>Otto∣man,</HI> when he is engaged with some potent Enemy else where, or perplexed with dangers and seditions, discontents or factions at home: But if the Conditi∣on of your Affairs cannot conveniently allow the ex∣pectation of these opportu∣nities, when your preparati∣ons have given him the Alarm, and drawn his for∣ces into the field, make use of shifts and delayes to fru∣strate his designs by declin∣ing engagement, and putting upon him the loss of the
<PB N="122" REF="68"/>whole expence of that <HI>Cam∣pagn:</HI> And the next year take the advantage of his se∣curity, want of preparati∣on and disability to appear on the sudden in compleat equipage: And be sure to march forward with all ex∣pedition, that you may for∣tifie your new Conquests, and be in a capacity to main∣tain them against him by a resolute defence before he advances to stop your course: and dispose your af∣fairs, so that when he begins to disband and draw off into his quarters, you may be ready to fall on: And by renewing the war, put him on the necessity of continu∣ing
<PB N="123" REF="68"/>his vast Armies in pay, (which he can by no means endure long,) or reduce his Army to so mean a pro∣portion, as may give you as∣sured hopes of victory.</P>
<P>No place is fitter for the seat of the war, than in some parts of <HI>Hungary</HI> remote from <HI>Danubius;</HI> for besides the narrowness of several pa∣ssages extremely incommo∣dious for the huge bodys of his Cavalry, He will be de∣stitute of those Convenien∣cies which the River affords for that immence baggage, and cumbersome train usu∣ally attending his Camp, whereof you may make ex∣cellent use to the benefit of
<PB N="124" REF="69"/>your, and prejudice, if not ruine of his designs. And to that purpose, I again Commend to you a good Correspondence with your Uncle the King of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> to whom you are to Grant and offer all Aydes of men or mony to keep the ballance even, till you find an opportunity to appear in the field.</P>
<P>The Turk relies intirely on the number and strength of his men: And your way to defeat him being by stra∣tagem; be carefull to draw him into straight and narrow places, where he cannot for want of room make use of his whole power. And
<PB N="125" REF="69"/>may be pinched for defect of Carriages, and necessa∣ry provisions. In Engage∣ments and Conflicts, provide Stout Companies of Foot to annoy his horse; who being generally without Ar∣mour, are soon routed by the strong impressions of a Gallant infantry. 'Tis a point of the Turkish disci∣pline, to reserve the Jani∣zaries for the last onset and recourse to victory: And if a choice sequadron be pickt out to engage them, from the beginning to the end of the battle; the unexpect∣edness of the stratagem will surprize, and much disorder the Janizaries, and abate
<PB N="126" REF="70"/>the courage of the rest of their Army, who are never out of hopes of victory, till the Janizaries are engaged and repulsed. By this po∣licy <HI>Hannibal</HI> gained seve∣ral victories against the <HI>Ro∣mans:</HI> And to it the <HI>Romans</HI> owe theirs over the <HI>Latines.</HI> Use all indeavours to in∣vite the people to Rebelli∣on against him, by good usage, immunities, exempti∣ons; or by building ram∣pires and forts fit for de∣fence and offence; where∣in you will find excellent instructions in my memori∣alls for speed and cheapness, and in the work their best use when perfected, to sub∣due
<PB N="127" REF="70"/>the forces of a great estate; whereof <HI>Caesars</HI> acti∣ons in <HI>France</HI> are an instance, as related in the Commen∣taries: And you may esteem the least declination of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> power, a great ad∣vantage to your affairs, by the opportunity it affords his suppressed subjects to endeavour the recovery of their lost liberties, which his tyranical government makes them willing to em∣brace, when invited by a fit occasion.</P>
<P>The solid strength of the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> receives addition of power by the willingness of other Prin∣ces, (and especially the
<PB N="128" REF="71"/><HI>Italians</HI>) jealous of our forces, to Assist that Crown against us: threfore let us con∣sider next the best way of making war upon the <HI>French.</HI> Had they known to im∣prove the taking of <HI>Casab,</HI> or <HI>Revolt</HI> of <HI>Sienna</HI> to the best advantage, we had felt e're this by dear experi∣ence, how much the <HI>Italians</HI> are inclined to novelty; and the great benefit the <HI>French</HI> may obtain with inconside∣rable charge in the wars of <HI>Italy:</HI> For though it can∣not be doubted, but that the Government of the <HI>French,</HI> if possessed of those places we hold in <HI>Italy,</HI> would in a short time be∣come
<PB N="129" REF="71"/>more offensive and insupportable to the inhabi∣tants, than ours: yet such is their itch of change, so great their jealousies of our forces in <HI>Milan, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Si∣cily</HI> that they throw open their Armes to receive any that promises to restore their liberty, which they think lost in the fetters of our power, in the places I have named. But 'tis your happiness, that by assaulting that King in his own domi∣nions (which you can easily doe) you will infallibly force him to recall his for∣ces from <HI>Italy,</HI> to defend <HI>France:</HI> And gladly imploy them to quench the fire
<PB N="130" REF="72"/>kendled in his own house, whom he had commanded to burn yours. It hath been their maxime long, not to leave an Enemy behind them: it must be yours to winn, and fortifie some place of importance in their passage to <HI>Italy,</HI> which may either stop their farther march, or at least entertain their forces so long, till yours be in readiness to re∣ceive them by defence, or stop them by diversion.</P>
<P>To this end, it was my design to build two or three forts between <HI>Turine</HI> and the <HI>Alps,</HI> of that Art and strength, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght deter the <HI>French</HI> from attempting <HI>Italy</HI> that way, by the diffi∣culty
<PB N="131" REF="72"/>of reducing those places to their obedience at so great distance from their Country: But this (as other designes) was prevented by my imployments else where: So that I propose it only, as worthy your consi∣deration, and hasten to give you brief rules for your wars in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>That King may be assault∣ed in his own Country two wayes, by taking some strong places upon the fron∣tiers, or by entring the heart of his Dominions with a compleat Army, and making your self Master of the field. But the strength of his Towns and Castles
<PB N="132" REF="73"/>on the borders, the vast expence, and tedious diffi∣culties of Sieges, the con∣stant charge and great Gari∣sons requisite to maintain and preserve them in your obedience, when taken; and the opportunities given him to Muster his forces, and make defence, before you can probably reduce the place you attaque; may in∣duce you to wave that course, and embrace the latter: and the rather, for that you have the conveni∣ency of Arming a great deal sooner than he; And thrust your forces into the bow∣els of his Kingdom, before he can be in readiness to
<PB N="133" REF="73"/>come into the field: And that his Country abounds so much with Victuals and other provision, that an Ar∣my cannot want in so great plenty: And needs only use its power to maintain it self by the spoils of the enemy. You cannot expect by one Assault, to break the force of so compact a Body as the Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> but think that expedition well made, wherein you become Master of a Limb, and bring some small part to your obedience; if you make good your ground, and retain firmly what you gain by peicemeal, every step you make advances you fur∣ther
<PB N="134" REF="74"/>towards the Conquest of the whole. This was <HI>Cae∣sars</HI> method in subduing that Nation. When you have once got footing there, a thousand opportunities from the distraction of that state, by their divisions and ani∣mocities in matter of Reli∣gion, the ambition of the great ones, and other acci∣dents, will present them∣selves for improvement of your interest. The Sun though he moves insensibly, doth compass the world in 24 houres. And common sence informs, you that the smallest particle taken from the lesser quantity, and ad∣ded to the greater, Auge∣ments
<PB N="135" REF="74"/>the one, and dimi∣nishes the other: which I mind you of, that you may not be discouraged, though you cannot on the sudden overcome this King∣dom; but persevere in the prosecution of your design upon this Assurance, that by gaining the parts, you will at last Master the whole.</P>
<P>If the French Kings mo∣tions give you cause to be∣lieve, that by the advantage of the season, and forward∣ness of the Country, he may enter <HI>Italy</HI> some moneths be∣fore your Army can arrive in <HI>France;</HI> Make shew of early, and great preparati∣ons against <HI>France,</HI> to march
<PB N="136" REF="75"/>thither as soon as the season of the year will permit: And by this stratagem you will oblige him to use those for∣ces for defence at home, which he designed for for∣reign Conquests: So jea∣lous is he of that Kingdom; So contrary is it to the Maxims of his Policy, to leave his frontiers unguard∣ed with an Army, when threatned with hostility from abroad, or to expose his Kingdom to an invation, in the absence of any conside∣rable part of his forces.</P>
<P>When you have resolved on either of these courses of war with <HI>France,</HI> take heed of wavering from your
<PB N="137" REF="75"/>choice, as a thing most distru∣ctive to your affairs: and avoyd it as a Rock shewed you by a Pilot, whose ship was split thereon. I entred <HI>France</HI> to∣wards <HI>Landrecy,</HI> with full purpose to have advanced into the heart of the King∣dom, before the <HI>Swissers</HI> ar∣rived to their ayd, but the altering of this resolution in my stay, to winn some Towns on the frontiers (which detained me longer than I expected, being de∣luded by the facility of re∣ducing the first I attaiqued,) gave the King time enough to provide strength sufficient to encounter me; and pro∣ved so fatal in the conse∣quence,
<PB N="138" REF="76"/>that I was con∣strained by plain force to re∣tire, and yield to conditi∣ons, which (to be free with you) served only for a Co∣lour of retreat, without any advantage to my affairs.</P>
<P>Pursue your victories in <HI>France</HI> effectually, and with diligence: And having for∣ced them to seek Ayds from abroad, fall on them afresh before the Auxilia∣ries Arive: And when the success answers not your ex∣pectation, repair your for∣ces, and hold them so long in play, till the season of the year make them despair of any advantage to be made in <HI>Italy</HI> by your re∣treat:
<PB N="139" REF="76"/>Rely not on the multi∣tude, but choice of your men; and prefer a gallant, though small Army, before a nume∣rous: and against <HI>France</HI> make special povision of strong Companys of foot to encounter their horse.</P>
<P>I will reiterate my advice against siting down with your forces before any place of strength that may require a long siege, unless invited by correspondence within, or some other particular advantage, that gives assur∣ed hopes of dispatch: and that not only for the rea∣sons given before, but that it is a matter of extream dif∣ficulty, to maintain an Ar∣my
<PB N="140" REF="77"/>long at a siege, where convenient room is not made for the Convoys. My randezvous a <HI>Marseilles,</HI> fru∣strated my design against <HI>Provence,</HI> and opened the eyes of the French King to spy his advantage, by diver∣sion in <HI>Turine;</HI> where he made war with security, forced me to retreat with great danger, gained credit with the States of <HI>Italy</HI> by the action, and had hazard∣ed all the estates you hold there, had he known as well to use, as perform his under∣takings.</P>
<P>The difficulty of recruit∣ing your Armies in <HI>Italy</HI> by supplies from <HI>Spain,</HI> when
<PB N="141" REF="77"/>requisite, upon any misadven∣ture; and the propensity of those States to Revolt from you, must incline you by assaulting <HI>France,</HI> to pre∣vent that King from casting his thoughts to disturb you in <HI>Italy;</HI> rather than to be on the disadvantage of an after gain, in ex∣pelling him from thence: And assure your self, that States, and especially the <HI>Italian,</HI> have no affection but for their interest, and will stick to you, to their own prejudice or danger, but will be ready upon the least appearance of your declining, to espouse the quarrel of the pre∣vailing
<PB N="142" REF="78"/>party, and fol∣low the fortune of the Conqueror. Bend all your force to recover <HI>Sienna,</HI> that other States may by that ex∣ample, perceive and fear the danger of slighting your Authority, and intermed∣ling with strangers, to the prejudice of your af∣fairs: And that you may by that means cut of the Correspondence between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Get perfect information of the affections, humours and interests of the per∣sons in greatest favour and credit with the French King, and the competi∣tors for great offices, and
<PB N="143" REF="78"/>use the best means to gain the strongest parties to your devotion; as the necessary and most excellent instru∣ments to promote your de∣signs. In alliances and trea∣ties, Esteem the removal of the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Pied∣mont,</HI> above millions of Crowns in Dower, or the most ample conditi∣ons in a league: And indeavour earnestly to in∣duce them to a desuetude from Arms, and a forget∣fulness of military exer∣cise. And when an op∣portunity is offered to your advantage, lose it not: As to <HI>Piedmont</HI> I will repeat my advice for
<PB N="144" REF="79"/>recovery of it; and be∣lieve it from my experi∣ence, to be of more im∣portance to your affairs, than if on the Flemish side you had bereaft the French King of a third part of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Your interest in <HI>Italy,</HI> is the main Artery by which the pulse of all your power beats: And wherein lyes the greatest mistery of your Policy: therefore must your eyes be ever open that way, even to Jealou∣sie: To preserve it the better, Use all devotion and kindness to the Pope and Apostlick See; Be cour∣teous to all the Cardinals,
<PB N="145" REF="79"/>Bishops, Prelats and other members of the Court, and ever ready to defend them, and the Catholique profession. In the Electi∣ons of Popes, when all the competitors are worthy of the dignity; Strive not to advance one before the other: And never use any means indirect, unlawfull or unchristian, to prefer your friends or creatures to the Chair; but look up∣on it as a sacred action to be left as the election of <HI>Mathias</HI> in the tent, to the disposal of the Holy Ghost. The expression of due re∣spects attended, with the consideration of your Do∣minions
<PB N="146" REF="80"/>situate in the midst of <HI>Italy,</HI> and other means in your power, as King of so many Countrys, and Patron of so many great Ecclesiastical benefices, will infallibly procure you the friendship of the greatest, and make the best amongst them dependants upon you, without loss or hinde∣rance to Princes of your quality, though the Pope were elected by the votes of that party, who de∣clared for another. But let me enjoyn you to pre∣fer alwayes the universal good of Christendom be∣fore your private benefit, though the Examples of
<PB N="147" REF="80"/>others seem to invert the Counsel I give you. As the Dominions of the Church, are the center of <HI>Italy;</HI> So, if <HI>Sienna</HI> were recovered, they would be surrounded with your Territories to the greater convenience for your de∣signs, and most commodi∣ous for an influence over the Court of <HI>Rome:</HI> If men of Piety sit in the Chair, they will in a religious ten∣derness of promoting Chari∣ty among Christians, both court and desire your love: if the Popes be worldly minded, and study more their pleasures and interest, then the duties of their
<PB N="148" REF="81"/>office, (which God forbid) they will be glad to pre∣serve his friendship, whom they dare not displease. Stick not to powre the trea∣sure of your bounties on that Court, in obliging the Car∣dinals, Bishops, and other Prelates, by dignities and preferments in your several Dominions; but especially them who are most intimate with the Pope, as most use∣ful in matters of grace and favour to be obtained from the Holy-Chair: though you are to rely most on the Justice and equity of your Demands, and the af∣fection of his Holiness.</P>
<P>The impressions of reli∣gion
<PB N="149" REF="81"/>are so deep in the hearts of men, that no∣thing can prejudice your affairs more, than to leave in their minds an opinion of your being disaffected to the Ministers of God: there∣fore if necessity force you to break with the Pope, be sure to clear your self from the imputation of the rupture, by making it appear, that the cause of unkindness proceed∣ed not from you, but from the other side: And that the course you take is not voluntary, but upon indispensable obliga∣tions of security and self preservation. In matters re∣lating
<PB N="150" REF="82"/>to a Generall Councel, conform your self to the determinations of the Ho∣ly-Chair; and whatever happens, let the world still perceive your Religion is unchangeable.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> you are sure of Peace with them, while you think fit not to break the league; by reason of their fear∣fullness to engage in war, though no assistance is to be expected from them for the reasons I have shewed. And that jealousie, and apprehensions of ill from the increase of power, will have greater influence in their counsells, than any
<PB N="151" REF="82"/>other considerations. Their long neglect of military discipline, and disuse of Arms, their letting slip so many brave opportu∣nities, the distractions of this age afforded them to Aggrandize their e∣state, may invite you to assault them; and their custome of making ad∣vantage of their weak neighbours miseries, may in a manner justifie it. A slothfull disposition and moderate prosperity, have inclined them to pre∣sume, their greatness may be maintained by ordi∣nances of peace and so∣ber rules of the Long
<PB N="152" REF="83"/>robe. But if you set upon them briskly, and pursue your first im∣pression with Celerity to prevent their band∣ing with other Princes; their unskilfullness in war, the weakness of their state, and the con∣fusions that will certain∣ly attend their fear of your Arms, will give you opportunity to com∣pass some great exploit before they awake out of sleep, or resolve what to spend, what friends to trust, what Leaders to employ, or re∣sume their old discipline for war. The conveni∣ence
<PB N="153" REF="83"/>they have to at∣taque you in <HI>Naples,</HI> and the inclinations of that people, to prefer their mild, and more civil Government, and kind usage of the inhabitants, before yours; will oblige you to get the start of them by carrying the war to their doors, and pre∣vent their attempts against your Dominions, by force∣ing them to provide for defence of their own: Let it be your care to powre your forces into the center of their state as the way to make your self master of the field, it being impossible for
<PB N="154" REF="84"/>them to put Garrisons into their places of strength, which they will first se∣cure, and at the same time to keep the field: And in the mean while the defect of Garrisons, Leaders provisions or for∣tifications, the factions and particular discontents of persons interessed, will certainly afford you the occasion, to possess your self of some of their places of stength; which will be a good step to your further progress, especi∣ally if by your Prince∣ly and Gracious deport∣ment, you encourage others to submit to your
<PB N="155" REF="84"/>obedience, by granting the Burghers, Captains and Sol∣diers reasonable Articles, and so good conditions, that they will have no just cause to complain of the change of Masters. When you are Master of the field, all places that are not strong will presently fall into your hands; which will force them into the field to en∣deavour the stopping of your prevailing Arms by battail, wherein the greatness of your strength, and expert skill of your Soldiers, may give you as∣sured hopes of victory over their new trayned
<PB N="156" REF="85"/>troops and raw Companies.</P>
<P>Let no pretence of friend∣ship, or professions of af∣fection from any Prince of <HI>Italy,</HI> move you to per∣mit him to aggrandize his state; but be perswaded by my advice, to keep them all within their due bounds, upon this infalli∣ble Ground, that they are true only to their in∣terest, and will no fur∣ther adhere to you, then while it is for their turn, but will appear against you, upon any proba∣ble hope to better their fortune. The divisions, and partialities of <HI>Italy,</HI> make it a matter of great
<PB N="157" REF="85"/>difficultie for you to pre∣serve in your obedience the States you enjoy there, their designs, and most ardent desires, being bent to establish a Duke at <HI>Mil∣lain;</HI> and a King at <HI>Naples,</HI> which may hold of no su∣periour, but reign Sove∣raign and Independant, as the means to weaken your encroaching power, and to free themselves from for∣raign servitude: And be∣cause they may upon all occasions treat on even terms, with such petty Princes; and that the bonds of a common inte∣rest, which is the surest obligation, would ingage
<PB N="158" REF="86"/>a King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and a Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> in a forreign league of Friendship with them, against forreign force, as involved in the like dan∣ger, with other States of <HI>Italy,</HI> of being opprest from abroad; whereas the ine∣quallity between them and you, is such that they neither dare engage in a war against you, for fear of losing the re∣mains of their liberty, and making their estates victims to your wrath; nor enter into a league, to add strength to your pow∣er, which they desire to see weakned, and increase your Authority, whereof
<PB N="159" REF="86"/>they are allready jealous. The Pope and <HI>Venetians</HI> are great promoters of the project I have told you; but the remedy is obvious to prevent their designes: for if you maintain your reputation, by a constant Activity in Armes, hold good intelligence in every State; Imploy able Mini∣sters to the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> make use of the di∣visions and factions of those Princes to your advantage, prevent combinations a∣mongst them, to your pre∣judice; keep out the French King from <HI>Italy;</HI> and when the waters are troubled dis∣creetly use the Golden∣hook,
<PB N="160" REF="87"/>you may conclude your affairs safe on that side.</P>
<P>These observations most dear Son I leave with you, as Rules for your conduct in Peace and War; And though the circumstances of things may vary, yet the reason of my advice, re∣maining the same, will be useful for direction in most occurrences of State. And now by the duty and gra∣titude you owe me your Father, your Prince and Benefactor, I charge you strictly, and constantly to observe with Reverence, the Laws of God and con∣science, to regard them as the controll of your reaso∣nings,
<PB N="161" REF="87"/>and Rules of indi∣spensable obligation in all your actions, that no de∣sign, no act, no stratagem can be just or worthy a Prince but what is consonant to them: And amidst the Ma∣jestick Glories of a mighty Prince, forget not your self to be a man, and that the prerogative of your Crowns exempts you from the ju∣risdiction of those tribu∣nals, where bribery may corrupt, affections blind, ignorance mislead, fear over∣awe, or impotence fru∣strate the judgement given, to reserve your cause to the dreadfull examination and sentence of that Judge,
<PB N="162" REF="88"/>who is Justice it self, and cannot be deceived; who for the sins of Princes gives their dominions to whom he pleases, without other respects to their Crowns, than to aggravate their offence in abusing the priviledges of their State, to the contempt of his Justice and presuming to commit such trangressions against his Laws, which they would not permit to be done by their Subjects against theirs. And remem∣ber you are to account to a Judge, from whom there is no appeal, who inflicts heaviest punishments on wicked Princes, as immedi∣ate
<PB N="163" REF="88"/>offenders against his Majesty, and therefore most fit to be made examples of Just Severity; as Good Kings are the immediate ob∣jects of his care and provi∣dence, partake most of his bounty and favours, and are in affection no less then in dignity, nearer to God than other mortals.</P>
