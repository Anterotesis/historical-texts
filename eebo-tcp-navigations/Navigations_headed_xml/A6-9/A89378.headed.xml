<HEAD>THE STATES OF HOLLAND And Zealand, Their Propositions to the King and Parliament, for an accommodation of Peace and Vnion betwixt the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and them selves, to oppose all Nations that shall come against them.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE States Generall for a long time have bin very scrupulous in declaring themselves, but since they began to discern what the Designs against the Parla∣ment of England were (and if
<PB REF="3"/> brought to passe would in conclusion prove their Raine.) Therefore the States of Holland and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealand for the better preventing of these designs of forreign Nations, they unanimously consented to have a generall meeting, at Amsterdam, where they concluded, and were more forward to ad∣vance this Association then before they were back∣ward, being now sensible of the Prince of Orenge his forwardnesse in giving way that Arms, Am∣munition, men, money, and other warlike provisi∣ons should be brought over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther, tending to the ruine of this present Parliament.</P>
<P>And furthermore for the preventing of these designs and Conspiracies, they are concluded for to declare their Resolutions to the Parliament of ENGLAND, and to present these following Propositions to that Grave and worthy Assem∣bly. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<P>THat whereas all forreign Nations ha∣ving intelligence of the Distractions and the great Disturbances that are now in this Kingdom, and the differences that are betwixt his Majesty and his great and ho∣nourable Assembly the High Court of <HI>Pur∣liament,</HI> have indeavoured and combined to∣gether, to raise a great power and strength,
<PB REF="3"/> together with an invincible Sayle of ships, with a wicked Resolution to come against these two Kingdoms of <HI>England and Scot∣land,</HI> to cast down and utterly destroy the true Protestant Religion: Therfore for the preventing of this damnable and Hell-bred Conspiracie, the States Generall, and the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> doe unani∣mously desire, that there may be a comply∣ance with the Parliament, and that there may be an Association and firme union be∣tween them, and the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<P>That as they understand, that in divers Places of Christendom there are great pre∣parations making for warre, for the de∣stroying and subverting of all the <HI>Prote∣stant Religion,</HI> so they most earnestly desire, that the three States may joyn together to defend the same.</P>
<P>The States further declared unto the House, that they had made stop of all the provision provided there to be sent to the
<PB REF="4"/> King, and are resolved that no aid shall be sent from thence.</P>
<P>The States are now in great controver∣sie with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for his for∣wardnesse to send supplyes to the King, and for his combining with Papists in forrein parts.</P>
<P>It was also further signified to the ho∣nourable houses of <HI>Parliament,</HI> by Letters from Mr, <HI>Strickland,</HI> that the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI> had provided 30. sayl of ships to tran∣sport Arms and Ammunition to his Majesty the King of <HI>England,</HI> but the States having information of them, immediatly hindered his proceedings, and made stopping of the said shipping.</P>

<HEAD>The Parliaments Answer to the States Propo∣sitions.</HEAD>
<P>UPon consideration of this businesse, the Commons have orderd that a Let∣ter of Thanks be returned to the States for
<PB REF="4"/> their fidelity to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and to in∣forme them that the Parliament do with much cheerfulnesse embrace their Proposi∣tion for an association, and firm Union be∣twixt these two Kingdomes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and them, and that they will haz∣za<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their lives and fortunes in defence of the true Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>It is declared, that Collonell <HI>Goring</HI> with 1500. Germans and French hath taken ship∣ping, and is comming for <HI>England</HI> to aid and assist his Majesty against the Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>But the Parliaments Navie which is now at Sea, having intelligence of their com∣ming, immediately hoysted Sayle and made towards them, the James, the George, and the Gray-hound drew nearer and nearer to them, and let fly two or three pieces at Colonell Goring and his Cavaliers, which made them tremble at the noyse of the Ca∣non, insomuch that they thought to have betook themselves to flight.</P>
<P>But Colonell Goring thinking himselfe sufficient enough to encounter with them,
<PB REF="5"/> charged a broad side against them, but the James and the George comming up with much fury, sunk two or three of Colonell Gorings ships, and held the rest play for the space of 4. hours, till at last the gorged Cavaleers began to betake themselves to flight.</P>
<P>There were slain of the Cavaleers in this battle about the Number of 500. as it is supposed, and of our side 20. with little or no hurt to the ships.</P>
<P><HI>The Lords and Commons assembled in Parl. do declare, that all souldiers that do commit any offence contrary to their Orders shall be brought to condigne punishment, and that they may be se∣verely proceeded against according to Law.</HI></P>
