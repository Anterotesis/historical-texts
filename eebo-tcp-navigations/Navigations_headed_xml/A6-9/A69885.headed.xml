Sir Thomas Twisden,
In the County of Kent,
BARONET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE desire I always had to
serve You, encouraged me
to prefix Your Name to this fol∣lowing
Treatise.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
Which being Collected from
the best of our <HI>English</HI> Historians,
whose Writings You have frequent∣ly
conversed with, I presum'd that
what was here so compendiously
Digested, would revive in Your
Mind some remarkable Observati∣ons,
not unworthy Your remem∣brance.</P>
<P>You have here, SIR, a short
view both of the ancient and pre∣sent
state of <HI>England;</HI> as also an
account of the most memorable
Battels, annex'd to the places near
which they were Fought. I have
spar'd for no Pains and Industry
to make it Perfect, I being ear∣nestly
desirous that it might in
some manner Merit Your Favour
and Esteem; which being once
gain'd, would be a great means in
engaging others (who are ambi∣tious
<PB REF="4"/>
of emulating Your Exam∣ple)
to receive it kindly.</P>
<P>How happy I have been in this
Performance, the Reader can best
determine; this I am sure of, That
if Learning and Sense, Wit and
Humour, join'd with an Address
that is every way becoming and
agreable, are accomplishments fit
to recommend a Gentleman, All
those who know You, and those
who are to know You, will ap∣plaud
my Judgment in chusing
You for my Patron.</P>
<P>Be pleased then, SIR, to af∣ford
a kind Reception to these my
first Offerings; let the fulness of
my Joy for Your safe return
amongst us, plead in my behalf,
and make an atonement for the
Faults You will here meet with.
Give me leave to hope that this
<PB REF="5"/>
short Description of Your own
Country, which cannot but be
very dear unto You, may find
some place among those excellent
Remarks which You have so late∣ly
made Abroad.</P>
<P>SIR, since the greatness of
Your Quality forbids me to come
near You as a Friend, Permit me
to Subscribe my self with all ima∣ginable
sincerity,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>NDER the Title of
<HI>ENGLAND</HI> we
comprehend the better
part of one of the best
and greatest Islands of
the whole Earth; which
together with that of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> is generally
term'd both by Ancient
and Modern Writers, <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> or <HI>Al∣bion.</HI>
It is bounded on the <HI>North</HI> with the
<HI>Hyperborean</HI> Ocean; on the <HI>West</HI> with the
<HI>Vergivian,</HI> or <HI>Western</HI> Ocean, which parts it
from <HI>Ireland;</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> it is divided from
<HI>France</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> Channel; and on the
<HI>East</HI> it is separated from <HI>Germany, Belgium,</HI>
and <HI>Danemark,</HI> with the <HI>Brittish,</HI> or as some
call it, the <HI>German</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
It is in length from <HI>Berwick</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI>
to the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> in the <HI>South,</HI> 375 Miles,
whereof 73 make a Degree; and from <HI>Do∣ver</HI>
in the <HI>East</HI> to the <HI>Lands-end</HI> in the <HI>West,</HI>
about 328; in compass 1300. In shape it
is Triangular, it having Three Promonto∣ries
shooting out into divers parts, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Cape of St. <HI>Burien</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Foreland
of <HI>Kent,</HI> and the Point of <HI>Catness</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
it contains according to Mr. <HI>Morden</HI>'s
computation, near 30 Millions of Acres,
being about the 1/1000 part of the Globe, and
the 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>33 part of the Habitable World.</P>
<P>Its Air is Temperate, the Cold in Winter
being neither so extream, nor the Heat in
Summer so vexatiously scorching, as in some
parts of the World, which have either a
more <HI>Southern,</HI> or <HI>Northern Scituation.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country is exceeding Fruitful,
'tis Bless'd with all the Commodities of
Heaven and Earth; it has Corn in abun∣dance;
it is rich in Pasture; it hath innu∣merable
quantities of Cattel; plenty of
Wild and Tame Fowl, and variety of all
sorts of Fish.</P>
<P>The People are Bold and Warlike, very
Tenacious of their Liberty, of a Generous
and Noble Disposition; see what the Inge∣nious
Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> says of them in his late
Poem.</P>
<Q><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<L>See, in the Ocean yon fair <HI>Western</HI> Isle,</L>
<L>Whose Three sharp Points th' insulting Waves
divide!</L>
<L>See with what beauteous Rivers 'tis suppli'd!</L>
<L>How rich the happy Fields thro' where they glide!</L>
<L>Well knew the Old <HI>Phoenicians</HI> that blest place:</L>
<L>Enur'd to Pain, there lives an hardy Race;</L>
<L>Daring as Virtues self for Conquest made:</L>
<L>Peace but their Recreation, War their Trade.</L>
<L>Jealous of Liberty they Chains refuse;</L>
<L>Fair Death before Inglorious Life they chuse:</L>
<L>Force cannot bend, but Kindness may improve,</L>
<L>And mildly melt their generous warmth to Love.</L>
<BIBL>Book the 3d. C. 1147.</BIBL></Q>
<P>As concerning its Name and its First In∣habitants,
Historians have left us in so great
an uncertainty, that we scarce know what
to resolve on; but we need not wonder at
so great an Obscurity, if we consider that
the First Inhabitants of Countries had other
Cares to employ their Thoughts, than to
deliver their Beginnings to Posterity; and
possibly had they been never so willing so
to do, they could not have effected it, see∣ing
their Life was so uncultivated and void
of all Literature, that it was almost impossi∣ble
for them to preserve the Memory of
things, and to make over the same to suc∣ceeding
Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Besides their <HI>Druides</HI> and <HI>Bardi,</HI> who Re∣hearsed
and Sung the Actions of their He∣roes,
not only like other Heathen Priests
Monopolized that little Learning they had
wholly to themselves, and were by this
means the only Persons suppos'd to be able
to give an account of what was past,
thought it not lawful to Write any thing.</P>
<P>Nor indeed have we any better account
of ancient times, even in those Civiliz'd
parts of the World, wherein Learning chief∣ly
flourished, when a profound Ignorance
overspread the face of <HI>Greece</HI> its self, as well
as other Nations; for if we would take the
pains to enquire strictly into the matter, we
shall there find as much darkness and obscu∣rity
as to their Original, as in these our <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Parts.</P>
<P>What Fabulous Stories would the subtle
<HI>Greeks</HI> impose upon us if we had the Faith
to believe them? Who (as a Learned Father
of our Church affirms) had not learn'd to
speak plain truth till the World was about
3173 Years old; for so it was when the
<HI>Olympiads</HI> began.</P>
<P>If we would enquire further into the
Succession of the <HI>Latins,</HI> and would take
the trouble to examine the two first <HI>Dynasties</HI>
the first before <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s coming into <HI>Italy</HI>
and the second of the <HI>Aeneadae</HI> after; fo
certainly it will be sufficient ground to que¦stion
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
the account of times before, if in the
third <HI>Dynasty,</HI> when the Succession seems so
clear, and so certain an <HI>Epocha</HI> as the Build∣ing
of <HI>Rome</HI> to deduce their accounts from,
their Chronology be yet uncertain; for se∣veral
of their best Historians make no scru∣ple
to confess, That no certain account can
be given of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was 25 Years af∣ter
the Olympiads, and but <HI>752 Ante Chri∣stum,</HI>
till the <HI>Regisugium,</HI> which was
268 Years <HI>Ante Christum</HI> 384.</P>
<P>A fair account then we are like to expect
concerning the first rise of our own Nation,
after so many revolutions of Ages, where∣in
Truth seems, as it were, more and more
to have withdrawn her self from us; which
to trace out, we must again return to the
<HI>Romans,</HI> who are the best able to satisfy us
in this case,</P>
<P>This is most certain, that the account of
Times before the <HI>Romans,</HI> either in <HI>Italy,
Germany, Old Gallia,</HI> or <HI>Brittain,</HI> is scarce sit
to be discoursed of under any other Head,
than that of Impostures; not that I think
that these Nations had lain in a perpetual
sleep till the <HI>Romans</HI> rous'd them with their
Swords, and waken'd them, as I may say,
into some kind of Civility; but that they
had no certain uniform way of conveying
the Transactions of their own, and former
times, to the view of Posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
On which account we may very justly
reject all those pretended Successions of <HI>Go∣mer</HI>
and <HI>Brute,</HI> as Fabulous; as also that
this Island was Inhabited by Giants; with
a great many other, I know not what,
pretty Stories, adapted to the Ignorance of
those times.</P>
<P>However, all Historians agree in this,
That it is highly probable that the first In∣habitants
of this Island were Originally de∣scended
from the ancient <HI>Gauls,</HI> (that part
of the World being long Inhabited before
this) which is sufficiently apparent from
the resemblance of their Government,
Manners, Conditions, Buildings, Habits,
and the Community of their Language,
which is the surest proof a Nations Ori∣ginal.</P>
<P>As for its Name, the most probable Con∣jecture
is, That it was termed <HI>Brittain</HI> from
<HI>Brit,</HI> which in the ancient <HI>Brittish</HI> Language
signifies Painted, and the word <HI>Tain,</HI> which
denotes a Nation; agreeable to the Custom
of the ancient <HI>Brittains,</HI> who used to dis∣colour
and paint their Bodies, that in their
Wars they might seem more Terrible to
their Enemies.</P>
<P>We are inform'd by <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> in his
Commentaries, That it was Governed at
first by several petty Rulers and Princes, of
different Interests and Counsels: He Land∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
in <HI>Brittain, A. M.</HI> 3095. or thereabouts,
but was repuls'd by <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssibelan,</HI> a Bold and
Warlike Prince, who was Chosen King, or
rather <HI>Generalissimo,</HI> by the Unanimous Con∣sent
of the other <HI>Roytelets,</HI> to repel the com∣mon
Enemy.</P>
<P>He afterwards made several Inroads into
it, but without any great Success; he in
the end being forc'd to leave it to the Go∣vernment
of its own Kings. <HI>Augustus, Ti∣berius,</HI>
and <HI>Caligula,</HI> seemed with good Ad∣vice
to have neglected it; but in the Reign
of the Emperor <HI>Claudius, Plau∣tius</HI>
the Praetor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. C. 43.</NOTE> and after him
<HI>Ostorius,</HI> subdued a great part
of it.</P>
<P><HI>Nero</HI> being Emperor, <HI>Sueto∣nius</HI>
his Lieutenant gained a
memorable Victory over <HI>Bon∣duce,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. C. 57.</NOTE>
the Wife of <HI>Prasutagus,</HI> King of the
<HI>Iceni:</HI> After which time the <HI>Romans</HI> still
gaining ground, the Island was at last totally
Conquered in the Reign of the
Emperor <HI>Domitian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. C. 82.</NOTE> and by his
Command first made a Pro∣vince
under <HI>Agricola,</HI> who much about that
time subdu'd <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> after they had kept it in Sub∣jection
several Hundred Years, were
upon the <HI>Northern</HI> Nations sacking
<HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> under the Command of <HI>Ala∣ricus,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
King of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> re∣called
by the Emperor <HI>Honorius;</HI> at which
time <HI>Brittain</HI> being left in a manner naked
and destitute of help, the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI>
presently invade it: The <HI>Brittains</HI> after they
had repelled them for several Years, being
at length much weakned, they Counsel
their King <HI>Vortigern</HI> to call the <HI>Saxons</HI> to
their Assistance; by whose Aid under the
Commands of their Captains <HI>Hengist</HI> and
<HI>Horsa,</HI> they overcame their Enemies in a
pitch'd Battel near <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI>
They rewarded the <HI>Saxons</HI> for this Victory,
first with the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> and afterwards
with the whole County of <HI>Kent;</HI> who
growing daily more Powerful, dispossessed at
length their Benefactors of their
Native Habitations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. C. 689.</NOTE> so that in
the Reign of <HI>Cadwallader,</HI> the
last of the <HI>Brittish</HI> Kings, they were com∣pleat
Masters of the whole Island, parcel∣ling
it out into seven Kingdoms, generally
called the <HI>Saxons</HI> Heptarchy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings striving amongst them∣selves
for Sovereignty, were at last, after they
had Ruled separately 129 Years, reduced
under subjection by <HI>Egbert</HI> King of the
<HI>West-Saxons, A. C.</HI> 818. who caused this
Land to be called <HI>England,</HI> by a Parliament
held at <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
From <HI>Egbert, England</HI> continued under
the Government of its own Kings, till the
Year 1017, which was 199 Years; about
which time <HI>Edmund,</HI> surnamed <HI>Ironside,</HI> be∣ing
Murther'd, (the <HI>Danes</HI> having for a
long time infessed our Coasts, hoping to
succeed as the <HI>Saxons</HI> before them had done)
<HI>Canutus</HI> King of <HI>Denmark</HI> seiz'd into his
hands the Regal Government.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danish</HI> Kings having Rul'd <HI>England</HI>
29 Years, <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> the Brother
of <HI>Edmund Ironside,</HI> succeeded in the King∣dom,
<HI>A. C.</HI> 1046. who out of the <HI>Saxon,
Mercian,</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Laws, Compil'd one
Universal Body of the Law, from whence
our Common Law is thought to have its
Original. He Reigned 20 Years, and died
<HI>A. C.</HI> 1066. to whom succeeded <HI>Harold;</HI>
who having Reigned near a Year, was slain
in a pitch'd Battel near <HI>Hastings</HI> in <HI>Sussex,
A. C.</HI> 1067. by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror;
from whom begins the most exact Compu∣tation
of the Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much I thought necessary to give
the Reader some insight into the first Ages
of our Nation, which I have endeavoured to
perform in as concise a manner as the Sub∣ject
could possibly admit of. I shall now
proceed in the Description of <HI>England,</HI> as it
stands divided by King <HI>Alfred</HI> into Shires or
Counties; which I have placed in that or∣der
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
as they are afterwards Treated of; be∣ginning
with the Learned <HI>Cambden;</HI> First,
in the furthest <HI>Western</HI> Parts, and so from
thence pass over the other Countries in or∣der;
imitating herein (as he judiciously
Observes) <HI>Strabo, Ptolomy,</HI> and others the
most ancient Geographers; who always
begin their Descriptions in the <HI>Western</HI>
Countries, as being first from the first <HI>Me∣ridian.</HI></P>
<P>The Shires of <HI>England</HI> are generally com∣puted
to be 39, to which if we add 13
more in <HI>Wales,</HI> reckoning the Isle of <HI>An∣glesey</HI>
to be one, the whole makes 52. 6 of
which were first Ordained in the Reign of
<HI>Edward</HI> the First, <HI>A. C.</HI> 1280. the rest
were constituted in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI>
the VIIIth by a Parliamentary Authority,
<HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1510.</P>
