<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AMerica</HI> was first discover'd by <HI>Christopher
Columbus</HI> a <HI>Genoese</HI> in the year 1492,
in the Name of <HI>Ferdinando</HI> King of
<HI>Arragon,</HI> but takes its Name from <HI>Ame∣ricus
Vespucius</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> who discover'd the
Country of <HI>Brezil</HI> five years after, by order of
<HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Europeans</HI> had no sooner enter'd on this
vast Continent, and the Islands about it, but the Na∣tives
shew'd 'em all imaginable Kindness and Respect,
and were ready to worship 'em as Gods; but these soon
took care to convince 'em of their Error, and to de∣liver
'em from the danger of falling into this sort of
Idolatry, by treating 'em with all manner of Cruel∣ties,
and tormenting 'em like so many Devils: so
that these barbarous People receiv'd as great a
turn in their thoughts concerning the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as
the Barbarians of the Island of <HI>Melita</HI> did in respect
of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> for as these believ'd him to be a God
whom they had just before taken for a Murderer, so
the other really found them to be Murderers, whom
they had a little before esteem'd as so many Gods.</P>
<P>The following Relation of the Destruction of ma∣ny
Millions of <HI>Indians</HI> by all the inhuman methods
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could invent, would appear incredible,
were not the truth of it confess'd, and attested by
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves, and among others, espe∣cially
by <HI>Don Bartholomew de las Casas</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Chiapa,</HI> who made large Complaints of these Cru∣elties
<PB REF="4"/>
to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the Royal Coun∣cil
for the <HI>Indies,</HI> with a design to put a stop to 'em
if possible. That he is a Person of irreproachable
Credit in this case, will appear by the following ac∣count,
wherein he challenges all the World to dis∣prove
the truth of the matters of Fact he asserts,
while he stood the Test of a Court who could easily
have detected him, if he had attempted to impose on
'em by a malicious Falshood.</P>
<P>This Bishop writes with such an Air of Honesty,
Sincerity, and Charity, as would very well have be∣come
one of a better Religion than that in which he
had the unhappiness to be educated. It may well sur∣prize
the Reader to hear a <HI>Spanish</HI> Prelat declaim
so loudly against Persecution, and plead so freely for
Liberty of Conscience in a Country subjugated to
the Inquisition. To hear him in his dispute against
Doctor <HI>Sepulueda,</HI> decry all methods of Violence for
the propagation of the Truth, as more sutable to
the Maxims of Mahometism than the Principles of
Christianity: To hear him assert the Natural Right
of all Mankind to Liberty and Property, and inveigh
against all Vsurpation and Tyranny in the smartest
Terms, is enough to move any one's Wonder, and Pity
too, when on the other hand 'tis observ'd how much
he magnifies the Power and Authority of the Pope in
some of his Propositions contain'd in the following
Treatise. But all may serve to convince one how great
an advantage or disadvantage a Man has as he
pleads the Cause of Truth or Error; and of the
great difference there is between the genuin Lan∣guage
of Reason and good Sense, and the servil
Prejudices of Bigotry and Superstition.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
'Tis no less a Subject of Admiration that a Book
of this stamp, which reflects so sharply on Persecution
and Tyranny, should see the light <HI>cum privilegio</HI> at
this time of day in <HI>France,</HI> where the Civil and Re∣ligious
Liberty of Subjects have not been provided
for with the utmost Care, where the Will of the
Prince has long since been the Law, and Dragoons
of late years the principal Missionaries for the Pro∣pagation
of the Gospel.</P>
<P>This Treatise was first compos'd in <HI>Spanish</HI> in the
beginning of the Reign of <HI>Charles V.</HI> and was
long since translated and printed in more Lan∣guages
than one; but having lately receiv'd a new
dress in Modern French at <HI>Paris,</HI> 'tis hop'd this
Translation from the <HI>French</HI> will not be unaccepta∣ble
to the English Nation. I'm sure the above∣mention'd
Principles of the Bishop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> con∣cerning
Property and Liberty both Civil and Reli∣gious,
are more agreeable to the Genius and Consti∣tution
of this Island, than to the present temper of
that part of the Continent which lies nearest to it;
and so this Book may expect at least as favorable a
reception in this Nation as in that where it has
been lately publish'd.</P>
<P>What the Bishop says here and there in favor of
his own Religion, is so weak, and has been so often
exploded here and every where else where the Refor∣mation
has obtain'd, that 'twould be unnecessary to
confute any of those Popish Fancies in this Preface.
'Tis enough for me that I have faithfully discharg'd
the part of a Translator. And if some particular
things occur more than once, it must be consider'd on
the one hand, that the Bishop had need to mention
<PB REF="5"/>
them on divers occasions, as when he disputed, and
when he wrote his Arguments for the use of the
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &amp;c. and on the other, that the Im∣portance
of the Affair, and the Greatness of his
Zeal to have the Grievances he complain'd of re∣dress'd,
made so deep an Impression of some things on
his Mind that he could not forbear to repeat 'em.</P>
<P>As for the Translation it self, I hope those that
shall have the Curiosity to compare it with the French
Copy, will find that I have done it Justice. And
if there is not that exactness of Method and Stile
the present Age expects, it may be the better ex∣cus'd,
when 'tis consider'd how long since the Original
was compos'd. However, the extraordinary things
contain'd in this History will make sufficient amends
for any Defects in the Composition of the Bishop of
<HI>Chiapa,</HI> and for the abrupt Transitions sometimes
us'd by the Compiler of this Treatise in putting the
Bishop's several Pieces together, of which it almost
wholly consists.</P>
<P>I shall only add, That as no History in the World
can parallel this for the inhuman slaughter of such
vast numbers of People; so these Barbarities, to∣gether
with the bloody Croisades in the 12<HI>th</HI> and
13<HI>th</HI> Centuries, as well as the many Persecutions
and Massacres since the Reformation, render it no
difficult matter to discern to what Church that Pro∣phetick
Character agrees, that <HI>in her was found</HI>
not only <HI>the Blood of Prophets and of Saints,</HI> but
<HI>of all that were slain upon the Earth.</HI> Rev.

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF THE
VOYAGES and CRUELTIES
Of the SPANIARDS in the
WEST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>THE <HI>West-Indies</HI> were discover'd in the
Year 1492; the year after the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
setled there, and inhabited this new
World. But for the space of these 49
years last past, an infinite number of People have
left <HI>Spain</HI> to dwell in these Countries: they generally
touch at <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> which is a very fertile and large
Island, and is become very famous: The Extent of
it is above 600 Leagues; 'tis surrounded with a mul∣titude
of small Islands, and abounds so with Inhabi∣tants,
that there's no Country in the World more po∣pulous.
The Continent, which is above 250 Leagues
distant from it, is of a vast Extent; a great part of
which has been already discovered, and fresh Dis∣coveries
are made every day: and such great num∣bers
of People inhabit all these Countries, that it
seems as if Providence had amass'd together the
greatest part of Mankind in this part of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
All these People are naturally simple, they know
not what belongs to Policy and Address, to Trick and
Artifice; but are very obedient and faithful to their
rightful Governors: They are Humble, Patient,
and Submissive, even to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have sub∣dued
and enslav'd 'em: they love to live quietly, and
are enemies to disputes and quarrels, hardly know∣ing
what 'tis to be malicious, and seldom meditating
Revenge.</P>
<P>They are a weak effeminate People, not capable
of enduring great Fatigues; they care not to be ex∣pos'd
to Toil and Labour, and their Life is of no long
continuance; their Constitution is so nice, that a
small fit of Sickness carries 'em off. The Children
of their Princes and Nobility, are in all respects
dealt with like those of the meanest Subjects: in
which they differ much from our <HI>Europeans,</HI> among
whom the Children of Kings and great Men, are
brought up with all the delicacy and tenderness ima∣ginable.</P>
<P>The People of this Island are so very poor, that
they live in the want of almost every thing; they
are very cool and indifferent in the pursuit of tem∣poral
Advantages, and seem not to be inclin'd to
Pride and Ambition; their way of living is so fru∣gal,
that the antient Hermites in the Wilderness
were scarce more Sober and Abstemious. All the In∣dians
in general go naked, only they have the mo∣desty
to wear a sort of Apron about their Waste.
They sometimes use a kind of shaggy Covering, or
a piece of Cloth an Ell or two long: Those of the
best Fashion lie on Beds made with Girts tyed in
Knots at the four Corners: their Apprehension is
quick and subtile, therefore they are very docile,
capable of receiving the impressions of sound Do∣ctrine,
and easily inclin'd to embrace the Principles
of the Catholick Religion: They are no Enemies to
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
good Manners, but have a greater disposition to Ci∣vility
than many other Nations, because their man∣ner
of Life is free from that care and distraction in
which the perplexity of Business involves others.
The very first Ideas and Instructions that are given
'em of our Religion, kindle in their Souls so great a
desire to the Sacraments and Divine Service of our
Church, that those Monks that instruct 'em, have
need of a great deal of Patience to moderate the im∣petuosity
of their Minds, and to answer all the Que∣stions
they have the curiosity to ask. And it may
truly be said that these Indian Nations would be the
most happy in the World, if endued with the know∣ledg
of the true God. The Spaniards themselves
who have treated 'em so ill, cannot but confess the
goodness of their natural Temper, and the great
disposition of their minds to every kind of Vertue.</P>
<P>The Almighty seems to have inspir'd these People
with a meekness and softness of Humour like that of
Lambs: and the Spaniards who have given 'em so
much Trouble, and fallen upon 'em so fiercely, re∣semble
savage Tigers, Wolves, and Lions, when in∣rag'd
with pressing Hunger. They applied them∣selves
forty years together wholly to the massacring
the poor Wretches that inhabited the Islands;
putting them to all kinds of unheard of Torments
and Punishments, (a part of which Cruelties exer∣cised
on these miserable <HI>Indians</HI> we design to describe
in the sequel of this Work) insomuch that this Island
which before the arrival of the Europeans, contain∣ed
about three Millions of People, is now reduc'd to
less than three hundred. The Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> the
length of which is equal to the distance between
<HI>Validolid</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> is entirely desert and destitute
of its Inhabitants, and nothing but Ruins now to be
seen in it. The Islands of St. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
have met with the like Treatment, which were
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
very fertile and populous, but are render'd desolate
and waste by the like means. The Islands near <HI>Cu∣ba</HI>
and <HI>Hispaniola</HI> on the North-side are sixty in
number, which are commonly call'd the Isles of Gi∣ants,
of which the least fruitful abounds more with
Plenty than the Royal Garden of <HI>Seville;</HI> but they
are destitute of Inhabitants, tho 'tis as wholesom
an Air as men can breath in. When the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
first landed in these Isles, there were above five
hundred thousand Souls; they cut the Throats of a
great part of these, and carried away the rest by
force to make 'em work in the Mines of <HI>Hispaniola.</HI>
When some pious Persons embarked to visit these
Isles after the Ravage the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made in 'em,
they found but eleven People left there: It was from
the motives of Charity and Compassion they under∣took
this difficult and perilous Voyage, in hope to
instruct these poor Creatures in the knowledg of Je∣sus
Christ. Above 30 Isles near that of St. <HI>John</HI> were
entirely depopulated, tho of a vast Extent, so that
there is scarce an Inhabitant to be found in them.</P>
<P>As for the Continent 'tis certain, and what I my
self know to be true, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have ruined
ten Kingdoms there, bigger than all <HI>Spain,</HI> by the
commission of all sorts of Barbarity and unheard of
Cruelties. They have driven away or kill'd all the
Inhabitants; so that all these Kingdoms are desolate
to this day, and reduc'd to a most deplorable Con∣dition,
tho this was formerly the best peopled
Country in the World. We dare assert, without
fear of incurring the reproach of exaggerating, that
in the space of those forty years in which the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
exercis'd their intolerable Tyranny in this new
World, they unjustly put to death above twelve
Millions of People, counting Men, Women, and
Children: and it may be affirm'd without injury to
Truth, upon a just Calculation, that during this
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
space of Time, above fifty Millions have died in
these Countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> who invaded these Isles, and boasted
of their Christianity, made use of two ways prin∣cipally
to exterminate the Inhabitants: the first of
which was by an unjust and bloody War carried on
with the utmost Barbarity and Cruelty; the other
was that detestable Policy which inspir'd them to
massacre all that had any remains of Liberty, or
endeavour'd to shake off their Tyrannical Yoke, and
to free themselves from so unjust and intolerable a
Slavery; for this the bravest, most potent, and most
warlike Nations off the <HI>Indians</HI> attempted. When
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had kill'd all the Men in the War, they
suffer'd the Women and Children to live, but with
the imposition of a Yoke so cruel and insupportable,
that their Condition was rendred as miserable as that
of Beasts. A multitude of other particular methods
were taken for the destruction of these poor <HI>Ame∣ricans,</HI>
but they may be reduc'd in general to those
two we have mentioned.</P>
<P>The Gold and Silver these People had in their pos∣session,
was the Motive that violently prompted the
<HI>Europeans</HI> to persecute and destroy 'em. The ear∣nest
desire they had of speedily enriching themselves,
in order to procure such Honour and Dignity as far
exceeded their Condition, inspir'd 'em with all this
inhumanity. In a word, their Avarice and Ambi∣tion
were arriv'd to an excess beyond Imagination;
the immense Riches of the new World, the tracta∣ble,
sweet, and good disposition of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
which render'd a descent into their Country easy to
any that would attempt it, have occasion'd all the
Ravage and Spoil, all the horrid Massacres and Cru∣elties
which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have caus'd 'em to suffer.
They made so little account of the miserable Inha∣bitants
of these Islands, that I may aver, without
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
fear of being accus'd either of Imposture, or of speak∣ing
inconsiderately, since 'tis that of which I have
been an Eye-witness, that they valued them less, and
treated them worse than Beasts. They had so little
regard to the Salvation of their Souls, that they
would not give themselves the trouble so much as to
speak of the Christian Faith and Sacraments to those
numberless multitudes of Men and Women whom
they sacrific'd to their Ambition and Tyranny. And
that which aggravates the enormity of their Crimes,
is, that these poor <HI>Indians</HI> had offer'd 'em no Inju∣ry,
but on the contrary, gave 'em as much Honour
and Respect as if they had been sent from Heaven;
till they were wearied out with repeated Outra∣ges
and Massacres, and constrain'd to betake them∣selves
to Arms contrary to their inclination, and to
repel force by force, to secure themselves from the
horrible Violences and Insults of their Enemies, who
invented divers kinds of Torments for them, with
a Barbarity beyond all Description.</P>

<HEAD>A particular Account of what the Spaniards did
in Hispaniola.</HEAD>
<P>AT this Island the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arriv'd in their first
Voyages, and here began to persecute and
murder the <HI>Indians,</HI> taking away their Wives and
Children, and using 'em, or rather abusing 'em at
their pleasure. They devour'd all that these poor
Creatures had amass'd together for their Subsistence
with a great deal of Care and Labour, not content
with what they freely offer'd 'em as far as their Po∣verty
and the meanness of their Condition would
permit: for they are satisfied with what is of pure
Necessity, not troubling themselves with superfluities,
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
or laying up great stores before hand. One <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
would consume in a day, that which would
have suffic'd three <HI>Indian</HI> Families of ten Persons
each, for the space of a whole Month. This ill
treatment and spoil soon made the Inhabitants of
this Island lose the Esteem they had conceiv'd of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they at first look'd upon as mes∣sengers
from Heaven: so that at length they began
to hide their Wives and Children, and whatever
Goods they had from 'em. Some retired into Caves,
others fled up into the Mountains to avoid meeting
with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who now appear'd so terrible and
cruel to 'em. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not content them∣selves
to beat 'em, and to offer 'em many other
Indignities, but cut their Throats in cold Blood:
and without any respect either to Age or Quality,
put their Princes, and the Governors of their Cities
to death: They came to that height of Impudence and
Villany, that a <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain had the Insolence
to abuse the Wife of the greatest King of the
Island. This vile fact drove 'em quite to despair,
so that from that time they sought means of dri∣ving
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of their Country; they be∣took
themselves to Arms, and did what they could
to defend themselves against these Tyrants: but
the Weapons they us'd were neither capable of
defending them, nor of offending their Enemies to
any purpose; and were more like those that Chil∣dren
use to play with, than such as are fit for Soul∣diers
to use in War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were mounted on fine Horses,
and armed with Lances and Swords, look'd upon
Enemies so meanly equip'd with the greatest Con∣tempt,
and committed the most horrible Slaughters
with Impunity. They pass'd through the several
Cities and Towns, sparing neither Age nor Sex,
but kill'd Women and Children as well as Men:
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
They rip'd up Women with Child, that Root and
Branch might be destroy'd together. They laid
Wagers one with another, who should cleave a Man
down with his Sword most dexterously at one blow;
or who should take his Head from his Shoulders most
cleverly; or who should run a Man through after
the most artificial manner: They tore away Chil∣dren
out of their Mothers Arms, and dash'd out
their Brains against the Rocks; others they threw
into the River, diverting themselves with this bru∣tish
Sport, and giving great shouts while they saw
'em in this misery: And to add insulting Scoffs to
their Cruelty, advis'd 'em to struggle in the Water,
and try if they could save themselves from drowning.
They held up the Bodies of Mothers and Children
together upon their Lances: they set up Gibbets,
and hang'd up thirteen of these poor Creatures in
honour to Jesus Christ and his twelve Apostles (as
they blasphemously express'd themselves): They
kindled a great Fire under these Gibbets, to burn
those they had hang'd upon 'em: They cut off the
Hands of those they sav'd alive, and sent 'em away
in that miserable condition, bidding 'em carry the
News of their Calamities to those that were retir'd
into the Mountains to escape the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>They erected a small Scaffold, supported with
Forks and Poles, upon which to execute their Chiefs,
and those of the most considerable quality among
'em. When they had laid 'em at length upon this
Scaffold, they kindled a gentle Fire, to make 'em
feel themselves die gradually, till the poor Wretches
after the most exquisite Pain and Anguish, attended
with horrible Screeches and Outcries, at length ex∣pir'd.
I one day saw four or five Persons of the
highest Rank in this Island burn'd after this manner.
But the dreadful Cries this Torment extorted from
'em, incommoding a Spanish Captain; and hindring
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
his Sleep, he commanded 'em to be presently
strangled. But a certain Officer whose Name I
know, and whose Relations are well known at <HI>Se∣ville,</HI>
put Gags into their Mouths to hinder 'em from
making a Noise, that he might not be depriv'd of
the brutish Pleasure of broiling them gently, till
they breath'd out their Souls in this Torment. I
have been an Eye-witness of all these Cruelties, and
an infinite number of others which I pass over in
silence.</P>
<P>And because these poor People took all the care
they could to hide themselves from a Generation of
Men so barbarous and wicked as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
had no Sentiment of Humanity, Honour, or Reli∣gion
left, but acted as if they were made for nothing
else but to destroy Mankind; to add further to their
brutish Cruelty, they taught Dogs to go a hunting
for these poor Wretches, and to devour 'em as if they
had been Beasts. And because the <HI>Indians</HI> after
they had been provok'd with so many unheard of
Injuries, now and then kill'd one of them when
they met with 'em stragling; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made
a Law among themselves to massacre a hundred <HI>In∣dians</HI>
for every <HI>Spaniard</HI> they should kill.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Kingdoms contain'd in the Island of
Hispaniola.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HIspaniola</HI> contains five great Kingdoms, the
Kings of which were very powerful, and go∣vern'd
all the other Chiefs, whose number is very
great: yet there are some independent Countries
which have their particular Lords, and are not
subject to any of those Kings. One of these Kings
they call <HI>Magua,</HI> which signifies a <HI>Plain,</HI> his Name
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
being taken from the situation of his Kingdom,
which is extremely pleasant. This Plain is 80
Leagues in extent from South to North, but is
only five, eight, and sometimes ten Leagues in
breadth. 'Tis encompass'd on every side with high
Mountains; 'tis water'd with a great number of
Brooks and Rivers, of which there are twelve that
come not behind those famous Rivers the <HI>Ebre,</HI>
the <HI>Duere,</HI> and the <HI>Guadalquivir</HI> for bigness. The
Rivers that water this Plain, especially those falling
down from a Mountain that looks towards the West,
abound with Gold. This Mountain bounds the
Province of <HI>Cibao,</HI> where the Mines bearing that
Name produce that pure Gold of the fineness of
24 Carrats, so much talk'd of in <HI>Europe.</HI> The So∣veraign
of this Kingdom was call'd <HI>Guarionex;</HI> he
had under him such powerful Subjects, that one of
'em could bring 16000 Men into the field for
the King's Service. I knew some of these Indian
Lords. This King was very submissive to the Kings
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and express'd a great deal of Affection to
them. His Humour was mild and peaceable; and
his Soul capable of every Vertue. He once or∣der'd
all his Subjects to bring him each of 'em a
great Purse of Gold; but finding they were not in a
condition to answer his Requirement, he remitted
half this Tax. The Inhabitants of this Island have
not the Art of extracting Gold out of the Mines.
This <HI>Cacique</HI> voluntarily offer'd himself to the Ser∣vice
of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> on condition the Queen
<HI>Isabella</HI> would take care that those Lands should be
cultivated, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> inhabited at their
first Arrival in the <HI>Indies,</HI> extending about the space
of 50 Leagues towards <HI>St. Domingo:</HI> for he said his
Subjects had no Experience or Skill to extract Gold
out of the Mines. If this Condition had been ac∣cepted,
he would faithfully and joyfully have accom∣plished
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
his Promise, which would have been of vast
advantage to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who might have
taken above three Millions of Gold every year out
of these Mines; and consequently there might now
have been fifty Cities in this Province as fine as
<HI>Seville.</HI></P>
<P>But what greateful Acknowledgments did the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> return to the kind Offers of this Prince,
who gave such Proofs of his Good-will to 'em, and
sincere desire to serve 'em? They cover'd him with
Shame and Infamy, his Wife was violated (as has
been said) by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, a Wretch un∣worthy
of the Christian Name. This Prince might
have waited for an opportunity to revenge himself
of this Outrage, but chose rather to retire and live
in Obscurity and Exile in the Province of one of his
Subjects, voluntarily abidicating his Kingdom and
Government. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being inform'd of the
place of his Retreat, pursued him with the utmost
Fury, without giving him time to hide himself. They
cruelly declar'd War against that Indian Lord that
had given him Sanctuary, and had receiv'd him with
a becoming Humanity and Respect; they ravag'd
all his Country, and never left off their Cruelties
till they had found and seiz'd this Fugitive Prince,
whom they loaded with Chains, and put on Ship∣board
to be carried into <HI>Spain</HI> as their Prisoner.
This Vessel was cast away in the Voyage, a great
many <HI>Spaniards</HI> drown'd, and an incredible sum of
Gold and Silver lost: Among the rest there was a
prodigious lump of Gold as big as a great Loaf,
which weighed 3600 Crowns. Thus did the Ven∣geance
of God meet with 'em for the enormous
Crimes they had committed in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The second Kingdom is called <HI>Marien,</HI> where
there is a fine Port just at the end of the other
Kingdom on the North-side: This Kingdom is
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
larger than <HI>Portugal,</HI> and more fruitful, and was
stor'd with vast numbers of Inhabitants; there are
divers Mountains in it, and several Mines abounding
with Gold and Copper. The Name of the King
of this Country was <HI>Guacanagari,</HI> who had divers
Lords under his Jurisdiction. 'Twas in this Coun∣try
that famous Pilot who first discover'd <HI>America</HI>
landed. <HI>Guacanagari</HI> receiv'd him with all imagi∣nable
Hospitality and Civility; he made the best
Entertainment he could for all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who
accompanied him: when their Ship was sunk, they
were receiv'd at this Prince's Court as kindly as if
they had been in the Houses of their own natural
Relations: here they met with all manner of Re∣freshments
and Recruits the Country afforded, which
were given 'em with great Expressions of Humanity
and Compassion on the account of their Hardships.
This King afterwards to secure himself from the
barbarous Usage of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they began
to commit their Massacres in his Country, abandon'd
his Kingdom, and was forc'd to retreat into some
of the remote Mountains, where he died with the
Fatigues and Inconveniencies to which he was ex∣pos'd.
Those Indian Lords that depended on him
found no better Treatment, but perish'd under that
horrible Slavery to which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had reduc'd
'em.</P>
<P><HI>Maguana</HI> is the third Kingdom of this Island,
and is an admirable Country, both for Health and
Fruitfulness. Here is made the best Sugar in <HI>Ame∣rica.
Caonabo</HI> was the King of it, who surpass'd all
the other Kings both in regard of his Power, the
Riches of his Kingdom, and the Respect and Cere∣mony
with which he was honour'd. This Prince
not keeping on his Guard, nor at all distrusting
what Tricks the <HI>Spaniards</HI> design'd to play him, was
surpriz'd in his own House by the Artifices they had
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
laid to insnare him. He was put in a Ship to be
carried into <HI>Spain,</HI> and there were at the same time
six Vessels in the Port ready to set Sail, when all on
a sudden there rose a horrible Tempest, which
batter'd the Ships to pieces and sunk 'em, with all
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were on board. King <HI>Caonabo</HI>
loaded with Chains perish'd, together with the
Vessel in which he was embarqu'd. The Almighty
was pleas'd to display his just and terrible Judgment
by this sudden Storm, in destroying so many <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
and thereby punishing the Crimes they had
committed in abusing the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> This King
had three or four Brothers, all of 'em valiant and
couragious Princes; who being much provok'd at
the unjust Captivity of the King, their Brother and
Soveraign, and inform'd of the Ravage and Massa∣cres
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made in other neighbouring
Kingdoms, and after all hearing the News of the
fatal End of their Brother, betook themselves to
Arms, and sought means of revenging themselves
on their Enemies. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> attack'd 'em with
their Cavalry, which is very formidable to the
<HI>Indians,</HI> whom they soon conquer'd, and made so
prodigious a Slaughter among 'em, that half the
Kingdom was depopulated and became desert after
this Defeat.</P>
<P><HI>Xavagua</HI> is the fourth Kingdom of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and
is as it were the Heart and Centre of all this Island;
the Language of it is the most refin'd and polite.
The People of this Kingdom are the most civiliz'd,
and their Manners more cultivated than those of
other parts of the Country: and there are a greater
number of great Lords and Persons of Quality
among 'em. These People are better shap'd, and
have a finer Aspect than those of the other King∣doms.
The King's Name was <HI>Behechio,</HI> he had a
Sister call'd <HI>Anacaona;</HI> both of 'em heap'd their Fa∣vours
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they landed in their
Country, and with a great deal of Generosity sav'd
'em from Death, which they could not otherwise
have avoided: They left no Stone unturn'd to shew
themselves obliging to the Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> After
<HI>Behechio</HI>'s Death his Sister <HI>Anacaona</HI> continued ab∣solute
Mistress of the whole Kingdom. One day
the Governor of the Island, accompanied with 60
Horse and 300 Foot, sends a Summons to about 300
of the greatest Lords of the Country to attend his
Person. These few Horsemen alone were able to
have ravag'd and laid waste not only all this Island,
but even the whole Continent, so defenceless were
these poor People. The Indian Nobles, not at all
suspecting any treacherous Design, were by the Go∣vernor's
Order brought into a House cover'd with
Straw, which he commanded to be set on fire,
where they perish'd miserably. Those of 'em who
attempted to escape were pursued by the Spanish
Troopers, and kill'd without Mercy. They also
kill'd a vast multitude of the common People, cut∣ting
'em and running 'em through with their Swords
and Lances. This same Governor caus'd Queen
<HI>Anacaona,</HI> who had the soveraign Authority after
the Death of her Brother (as has been said) to be
hang'd, that he might disgrace the Memory of that
Princess as much as he could by so vile and igno∣minious
a Death. If at any time a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> either
touch'd with the Sentiments of Compassion, or
prompted with those of Avarice, thought fit to
spare one of these poor Wretches for his own Ser∣vice;
another would come transported with Rage,
and fall upon him in his presence, and either run
him through the Body, or cut off his Legs, so as to
render him unserviceable. Some of these <HI>Indians</HI>
who escap'd this Massacre retir'd into an Island not
above eight Leagues distant from this Kingdom, to
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
shelter themselves from the Fury of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
but these were condemned by the Governor to
perpetual Slavery.</P>
<P>The Name of the fifth Kingdom is <HI>Hiquey: Hi∣quanama</HI>
the Queen, who govern'd it, tho very
much advanc'd in Years and decrepit, was hang'd by
order of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who tormented an infinite
number of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom by di∣vers
kinds of cruel Punishments. Some they burn'd
alive, they cut off the Arms and Legs of others,
and made Slaves of the rest. There are so many
things to be said of the ill Treatment and Cruelty
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> exercis'd against the People of this
Island, that 'tis impossible to recount 'em all; and if
that could be done, the recital of 'em would ap∣pear
incredible: and yet the <HI>Indians</HI> gave the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
no occasion to engage in so barbarous a War
against 'em, and to commit such Violences upon
'em; but one may truly say, these poor Creatures
liv'd in as great Subjection and Obedience to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> as the most submissive and obsequious
Order of Monks do in the most regular and well-disciplin'd
Monastery; so that there was no lawful
occasion given 'em to rob those of their Property,
or condemn 'em to a rigorous Slavery, who had
found means of escaping their bloody Massacres.
'Tis further to be observ'd, that the <HI>Indians</HI> offer'd
no Affront to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they first arriv'd
in <HI>America:</HI> So that they had no colourable Pretext
for Revenge, or the least right to punish 'em after so
cruel a manner. As for those Sins, the Punishment
of which God has reserv'd to himself, such as Hatred,
Envy, the passionate desire of Revenge, the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
had no occasion to reproach 'em on this ac∣count,
since these People have scarce more Strength
and Courage than Children of ten Years old. On
the other side, the <HI>Indians</HI> had a thousand just Rea∣sons
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
to make War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho these had
no reasonable pretence to treat them as they did
with a barbarity equal to that of the most savage
and inhuman Tyrants.</P>
<P>After this unjust War was ended with the De∣struction
and Massacre of all the Inhabitants of these
Countries, having reserv'd few besides the Women
and Children, they divided these among themselves,
some keeping 30 of them, others 40, others 100,
some 200, according to the Interest they had in the
Tyrant of the Island, whom they honour'd with the
Title of Governor; for 'twas he that gave 'em
these <HI>Indians,</HI> on condition they would cause 'em to
be instructed in the Maxims of the Catholick Reli∣gion,
tho the Persons to whose care he committed
'em were the most ignorant, cruel, covetous, and
vitious of all Mankind. These (as might well have
been expected) took no care to instruct 'em; but
confined the men to the Mines to get out Gold with
incredible Toil and Labour; they us'd the Women
for Husbandry and Tillage, tho this last was a La∣bour
hard enough for men of the most robust and
vigorous Constitution. They fed 'em only with
Herbs, or such like Food, that had but little Sub∣stance
or Nourishment in it: So that the Milk dry'd
up in the Breasts of the Women that gave suck, and
their Children in a little time pin'd away and dyed
with Faintness and Hunger. The Men having no
Conversation with the Women, but dwelling in se∣parate
Houses, there could be no farther propaga∣tion
of Children by 'em. Thus at length the Men
perish'd in the Mines with Hunger and Labour, the
Women dyed under the pressure of their servitude
in the Fields; so that all the Inhabitants of this po∣pulous
Island were exterminated in a short time.
And indeed if the same course were taken every
where else, all Mankind would be destroy'd in the
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
space of a few Years. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> oblig'd these
poor Creatures to carry Burdens of fourscore or a
hundred pound weight for a hundred or two hun∣dred
Leagues. And that they might travel the
more at ease, they would make these <HI>Indians</HI> carry
them in Chairs and Horse-litters on their Shoulders:
They us'd 'em like Beasts of Burden to carry their
Utensils, and what they pleas'd either for their Pro∣fit
or Pleasure, so that the Backs and Shoulders of
these poor Slaves were black with Bruises occasion'd
by the great weight of their Burdens. These in∣credible
Fatigues did not secure 'em from Blows
with Cudgels and Whips, accompanied with Curses,
nor from a great many other Punishments. But
'twould be endless to describe all the Miseries these
unfortunate People were made to suffer; it would
require whole Volumes, and the reading of so de∣plorable
a Story would deeply affect and soften eve∣ry
Mind not quite divested of Humanity.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd that the Destruction and Deso∣lation
of these Provinces began since the Death of
the most serene Queen <HI>Isabella,</HI> who departed this
Life in the Year 1504. Before this time the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
never durst exercise their Cruelties on the
People of this Island, nor destroy their Country: if
they offer'd 'em any Violence, 'twas as it were by
stealth, and with great Precaution. But after the
Death of this Princess, the Desolation became gene∣ral.
Before this fatal time, they took great care to
conceal whatever Hardships they made these People
endure, because the Queen was marvellously zealous
both to promote the Instruction and Salvation of the
Inhabitants of this new World, and to advance their
Temporal Advantages; and accordingly she gave us
many Examples of her Piety and Zeal.</P>
<P>In whatever part of <HI>America</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> set
their Feet, they perpetrated the same abominable
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
Villanies and Massacres, to oppress and exterminate
these poor Innocents. They seem'd to take Plea∣sure
in the invention of new kinds of Torments,
and their Fury augmented every day more and
more, till God Almighty provok'd by so many hor∣rid
Crimes, abandon'd 'em to a reprobate Sense,
and permitted 'em to fall as it were from deep to
deep, and from one Precipice to another.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Islands of St. John and Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1509 the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went into the
Islands of <HI>St. John</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> (which resemble
delicious Gardens) with the same Intentions and De∣signs
they had carried on in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola.</HI>
Here they committed a world of Robberies and
Cruelties, just as they had done in other places
where-ever they came. The Marks of their De∣vastations
and Murders were every where to be seen.
They laid all places desolate where they arriv'd,
exposing Men to the Mercy of Beasts. And after
having inflicted all sorts of Torments on 'em, put
'em in the Mines to work like Slaves as long as they
liv'd. They entirely depopulated these Countries,
so that in these two Islands, where there were com∣puted
to have been above 600000. Inhabitants be∣fore
their Arrival, there are scarce 200 now to be
found: The rest being all destroy'd with Misery
and Hardship, and that without having any Pains
taken with 'em to instruct 'em in our Religion, or
to administer the Sacraments to 'em.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Island of Cuba.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> pass'd into the Island of <HI>Cuba</HI> in
the year 1511, which contains as much ground
in length as from <HI>Vallidolid</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> There were
formerly fine and flourishing Provinces to be seen,
fill'd with vast numbers of People, who met with
no milder or kinder Treatment from the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
than the rest. On the contrary, they seem'd to
have redoubled their Cruelty upon those People.
There happen'd divers things in this Island that de∣serve
to be remark'd. A rich and potent <HI>Cacique</HI>
nam'd <HI>Hathuey</HI> was retir'd into the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> to
avoid that Slavery and Death with which the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
menac'd him: and being inform'd that his
persecutors were upon the point of landing in this
Island, he assembled all his Subjects and Domesticks
together, and made a Speech to 'em after this man∣ner.
<HI>You know</HI> (said he) <HI>the Report that is spread
abroad, that the</HI> Spaniards <HI>are ready to invade this
Island; and you are not ignorant of the ill Ʋsage our
Friends and Country-men have met with at their hands,

<HI>Hispaniola</HI> is called in their Language) <HI>they are now
coming hither with a design to exercise the same Outrages
and Persecutions upon us. Are you ignorant</HI> (says he)
<HI>of the ill Intentions of the People of whom I am speaking?
We know not</HI> (say they all with one Voice) <HI>upon
what account they come hither, but we know they are a
very wicked and cruel People. I'll tell you then</HI> (reply'd
the <HI>Cacique) that these Europeans worship a very cove∣tous
sort of God, so that 'tis difficult to satisfy him; and
to perform the Worship they render to this Idol, they'll
exact immense Treasures of us, and will use their utmost
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
Endeavour to reduce us to a miserable state of Slavery,
or else to put us to death.</HI> Upon which he took a Box
full of Gold and valuable Jewels which he had with
him, and exposing it to their view: <HI>Here is</HI> (says
he) <HI>the God of the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>whom we must honour
with our Sports and Dances, to see if we can appease
him, and render him propitious to us; that so he may
command the</HI> Spaniards <HI>not to offer us any Injury.</HI>
They all applauded this Speech, and fell a leaping
and dancing round the Box, till they had quite
tired and spent themselves. After which the <HI>Cacique
Hathucy</HI> resuming his Discourse, continued to speak
to them in these terms: <HI>If we keep this God</HI> (says he)
<HI>till he's taken away from us, he'll certainly cause our
Lives to be taken from us; and therefore I am of opinion
'twill be the best way to cast him into the River.</HI> They
all approv'd of this Advice, and went all together
with one accord to throw this pretended God into
the River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were no sooner arriv'd in the Isle
of <HI>Cuba,</HI> but this <HI>Cacyque</HI> who knew 'em too well,
began to think of retreating, to secure himself from
their Fury, and resolv'd to defend himself by force
of Arms, if he should happen to meet with them;
but he unfortunately fell into their Hands: and be∣cause
he had taken all the precautions he could to a∣void
the Persecutions of so cruel and impious a Peo∣ple,
and had taken Arms to defend his own Life, as
well as the Lives of his Subjects; this was made a
capital Crime in him, for which he was burn'd a∣live.
While he was in the midst of the Flames, tied
to a Stake, a certain Franciscan Frier of great Piety
and Vertue, took upon him to speak to him of God
and our Religion, and to explain to him some Arti∣cles
of the Catholick Faith, of which he had never
heard a word before, promising him Eternal Life,
if he would believe, and threatning him with eter∣nal
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
Torment, if he continued obstinate in his Infi∣delity.
<HI>Hathuey</HI> reflecting on the matter, as much
as the Place and Condition in which he was would
permit, ask'd the Frier that instructed him, whe∣ther
the Gate of Heaven was open to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
and being answer'd that such of 'em as were good
men might hope for entrance there: The <HI>Cacyque,</HI>
without any farther deliberation, told him, he had
no mind to go to Heaven, for fear of meeting with
such cruel and wicked Company as they were; but
would much rather choose to go to Hell, where he
might be deliver'd from the troublesom sight of such
kind of People: To so great a degree have the wicked
Actions and Cruelties of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dishonor'd
God and his Religion in the Minds of the <HI>Americans.</HI></P>
<P>One day there came to us a great number of the
Inhabitants of a famous City, situate above 10
Leagues from the place where we lodg'd, to com∣plement
us, and bring us all sorts of Provisions and
Refreshments, which they presented us with great
marks of Joy, caressing us after the most obliging
manner they could. But that evil Spirit that pos∣sess'd
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> put 'em into such a sudden Fury
against 'em, that they fell upon 'em and massacred
above 3000 of 'em, both Men and Women, upon
the spot, without having receiv'd the least Offence
or Provocation from 'em. I was an Eye-witness of
this Barbarity; and whatever endeavours were
us'd to appease these inhuman Creatures, 'twas im∣possible
to reduce 'em to Reason; so resolutely
were they bent to satiate their brutal Rage by this
barbarous Action.</P>
<P>Soon after this I sent Messengers to the most noted
<HI>Indians</HI> of the Province of <HI>Havane,</HI> to encourage
and engage 'em to continue in their Country, and
not to trouble themselves to seek remote places to
hide in, and advis'd 'em to come to us with assurance
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
of our Protection. They knew well enough what
Authority I had over the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and I gave 'em
my word, no Injury should be offer'd 'em: for the
past Cruelties and Massacres their Country-men had
suffer'd, had spread Fear and Terror through all the
Country; and this Assurance I gave 'em was with
the Consent and Advice of the Captains and other
Officers. When we enter'd into this Province, two
and twenty of their Chiefs came to us, and the ve∣ry
next Morning the Commander of our Troops,
without any regard to the Promise that had been
made 'em, would needs sentence 'em to be burnt,
pretending 'twas best to put these People to death,
because they might one time or other use some Stra∣tagem
to surprize and destroy us: And I had all
the difficulty in the world to prevent 'em from
throwing 'em into the Fire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Havane</HI> seeing themselves reduc'd
to a state of severe Slavery, and that there was no
Remedy left, but they were irrecoverably undone,
began to seek Refuge in the Deserts and Mountains,
to secure themselves if possible from Death: Some
strangled themselves in despair; Parents hang'd
themselves, together with their Children, to put the
speedier end to their Miseries by Death. Above
two hundred <HI>Indians</HI> perish'd here after this manner,
to avoid the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and abun∣dance
of them afterwards voluntarily condemn'd
themselves to this kind of Death, hoping thus in a
moment to put a period to the Miseries their Per∣secutors
inflicted on 'em.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Spaniard</HI> who had the Title of Sove∣raign
in this Island, and had three hundred <HI>In∣dians</HI>
in his Service, destroy'd a hundred and sixty
of 'em in less than three Months, by the excessive
Labour he continually exacted of 'em. The Recruits
he took to fill up their places were destroy'd after
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
the same manner; and he would in a short time have
unpeopled the whole Island, if Death, which took
him out of the way very happily for those poor
Wretches, had not shelter'd 'em from his Cruelties.
I saw with with my own Eyes above six thousand
Children die in the space of three or four Months,
their Parents being forc'd to abandon 'em, being
condemn'd to the Mines. After this the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
took up a Resolution to pursue those <HI>Indians</HI> that
were retir'd into the Mountains, and massacred mul∣titudes
of 'em; so that this Island was depopulated
and laid waste in a very little time. And 'tis a most
lamentable Spectacle to see so fine a Country thus
miserably ruin'd and unpeopled.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Continent.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1514, a merciless Governor, destitute
of the least sentiment of Pity or Humanity, who
was deservedly accounted a barbarous Tyrant, and
cruel Instrument of the Wrath of God, pierc'd into
the Continent, being follow'd by a great many
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> all animated with the Spirit, and pur∣suing
the Designs of their Leader. Tho some of
his stamp had enter'd the Continent before him,
and had kill'd a great many People, yet they had
only exercis'd their Robberies and Cruelties on the
Sea-Coasts. But he of whom I am now speaking,
surpass'd all his Predecessors in Cruelty and Impiety.
He was not content to ravage the Sea-Coasts, but
laid waste great Kingdoms and vast Countries, and
destroy'd an infinite number of <HI>Indians</HI> in the gross
Darkness of their Idolatry. He run through above
fifty Leagues of the finest Country in the World,
and carried Desolation with him where-ever he
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
went, ruining in a little time the most pleasant and
fruitful Country in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> There were
before the Arrival of this Tyrant, abundance of
Villages, Towns and Cities, that excell'd those of
all the neighbouring Countries. This Country a∣bounds
more in Gold than any yet discover'd. The
immense Riches that have fill'd <HI>Spain</HI> since she has
traded to the <HI>Indies,</HI> have been chiefly drawn out
of the Mines of the Country of which I am now
speaking.</P>
<P>The Governor of this new World invented va∣rious
kinds of Torments to constrain the Inhabitants
to give him all the Gold they had heap'd together.
In one Progress which some of his Captains made by
his Order to pillage and rob the People of their
Riches, they put above forty thousand of 'em to
the Sword; others they burnt, others they expos'd
to be devour'd by Dogs, and the rest they destroy'd
with divers other kinds of cruel Punishments.</P>
<P>The wretched Ignorance of those that have been
sent to govern the <HI>Indies,</HI> has occasion'd a great ma∣ny
Mischiefs and Disorders, and hinder'd the Con∣version
of the <HI>Indians:</HI> for what they endeavour'd
to perswade 'em by their Words, was contradicted
by their Actions; and the Sentiments of their
Minds were no ways conformable to the Pretensions
of their Tongues. They commanded the <HI>Indians</HI>
to embrace the Christian Religion upon pain of
Death, they menac'd 'em with cruel Slavery, or the
most exquisite Tortures, to force 'em to turn Christi∣ans,
or to swear Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain:</HI>
As if the Son of God, who dy'd for the Redemption
of Men, had ordain'd those whom he sent to preach
the Gospel, and to declare the Kingdom of God,
to constrain People that liv'd peaceably in their
own Country, to make profession of his Doctrine,
on pain of being plunder'd of their Goods, of being
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>
separated from their Wives and Children, of losing
their Liberty, and of being condemn'd to a cruel
Death, without having ever been instructed in the
Maxims and Principles of our Religion. And the
poor Creatures must be oblig'd to render an exact
Obedience to a King they had never seen or heard
of, till they were inform'd of him by these Messen∣gers
of his that treated 'em so inhumanly.</P>
<P>This bloody and impious Governor, urg'd with
the insatiable desire of heaping up Treasure, pilla∣ged
the <HI>Indians</HI> that dwelt both in the Villages and
Cities with Impunity, while they little thought of
securing themselves against his Robberies. He or∣der'd
his Souldiers to go privately to the places
where they suspected any Gold was to be found,
and to declare his Orders to the Inhabitants of this
new World after the following manner. <Q><HI>Caciques</HI>
and <HI>Indians</HI> of this Continent, we are come to de∣clare
to you that there is but one God, one Pope,
and one King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who is Lord and Master of
the Country you inhabit; we therefore require
you to come immediately and take the Oath of
Allegiance to him.</Q> After such kind of Preambles
as these, they would choose the Night to fall sud∣denly
upon these poor Wretches, when laid fast
asleep, without having taken any measures to secure
themselves from the Artifices of their Enemies,
who would set fire to their Houses, which being
thatch'd with Reeds and Straw, were burnt to Ashes
in an instant. The Women and Children were de∣vour'd
by the Flames almost before they had time to
consider where they were. They massacred such
as made a shift to escape the Fire, or kept 'em for
Slaves; they used Tortures to force 'em to tell
where they had hid their Gold. They printed
Marks on their Bodies with red hot Branding-irons;
and after all these Cruelties, us'd their utmost dili∣gence
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
to make a strict search for the Gold of these
miserable People, of which they got vast Quantities
together, besides Pearls and Diamonds, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> gave 'em to avoid their Fury. All the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
who had any Office or Place of Trust, com∣mitted
the same Rapine; every one sent as many
Souldiers as he could to make their Progresses, and
ravage all the Country. The first Bishop that was
sent into <HI>America,</HI> imitated the Conduct of these
covetous Governors, and made use of his Servants
to procure himself a share of the Spoil. The <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in a little time carried away above three
Millions out of this Kingdom; of which vast Sum
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had scarce 3000 Crowns for his
share. Here were above 800000 People slaughter'd;
and the succeeding Governors continued the like
Massacres till they had destroy'd the rest of the Na∣tives.</P>
<P>I must not pass over in silence one Action com∣mitted
in this Country by the Governor, of whom
I have been speaking. A <HI>Cacique,</HI> whether volun∣tarily
or out of fear I know not, gave him the weight
of 9000 Crowns in Gold: This great Sum not con∣tenting
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they tied this unhappy Prince
to a Stake, and setting fire to his Feet, endeavour'd
by this means to extort a greater quantity from him.
This Torment being intolerable to him, he gave
'em the weight of 3000 Crowns of Gold more,
which he had reserv'd; upon this they renew'd their
Tortures, to get still more out of him: but whether
he had no more to give 'em, or whether he was
resolv'd they should exact no more of him, he ex∣pir'd
amidst their Tortures. They put to death
many of the most considerable Persons of this
Kingdom after the same cruel manner.</P>
<P>A Company of <HI>Spaniards</HI> happening to light on a
Body of <HI>Indians</HI> that had retreated into the Moun∣tains,
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>
to avoid the Tyranny of their Persecutors,
in a great rage fell upon the poor Wretches, and
killing all the Men they could catch, carried away
three or fourscore Women Prisoners. The <HI>Indians</HI>
that escap'd being highly incens'd, came in Arms to
attack the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to try if they could oblige
'em to let go their Prey: These seeing the <HI>Indians</HI>
draw near 'em, and being unwilling to surrender
the Booty they had taken, stab'd the Women and
Maids in the presence of their Husbands and Fathers,
who were seiz'd with Horror and Despair at the
sight of so lamentable a Tragedy; and smiting their
Breasts, cry'd out, <HI>O merciless Men! O cruel Spa∣niards!
who can murder poor Women that never offended
you without Pity!</HI> And indeed they must be more sa∣vage
and bloody than Beasts of Prey, who can be
capable of such brutish Actions as these.</P>
<P>One of the greatest Lords of this Country,
whose Name was <HI>Paris,</HI> had a House about ten or
fifteen Leagues distance from <HI>Panama;</HI> he was very
rich, having a great quantity of Gold in his possessi∣on.
When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came to his House, he re∣ceiv'd
'em with as much Kindness and Civility as if
they had been his Relations. He frankly gave the
Captain the value of 15000 Crowns: This Captain,
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that accompanied him, concluded
that this Indian must needs have immense Treasures,
from the parcel of Gold he had given 'em; and
since they had undertaken this Journey on purpose
to rob him, to make the more sure of succeeding in
their Design, they pretended they would be gone,
and accordingly took their leave of him, but re∣turn'd
in the middle of the Night, and rushing into
the City unexpectedly, they set it on fire, and de∣stroy'd
abundance of the Citizens in the Flames,
and carried away thence 50 or 60000 Crowns. A
Person of the most considerable Quality of any in
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>
this City escap'd the fury of this Fire; and after a
Respite of three or four days, having got as many
Men together as he could, fell upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by
surprize, kill'd about fifty of 'em, and retook all
the Spoil of the City which they had burnt, and
particularly the Value of 40000 Crowns, of which
they had plunder'd him: the rest of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
made the best of their way and escap'd, but not
without a great many Wounds. Soon after this
they return'd with a greater Force to attack this
<HI>Cacique,</HI> and destroy'd the greatest part of his
Troops, making Slaves of the rest.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Province of Nicaraqua.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1522, the forementioned Governor
undertook to subdue the Province of <HI>Nicaraqua.</HI>
The great Fertility of this Country, the Goodness of
the Air, and the vast number of the Inhabitants
cannot be sufficiently express'd. There were Cities
in this Province four Leagues in length. The great
quantities of excellent Fruits that grow there, drew
together those great multitudes of People. These
Cities being situate in vast Plains, the People had
no Mountains near in which to hide themselves;
besides, the Climat is so sweet, and the Country so
agreeable, that the Inhabitants could not easily re∣solve
to quit it, and consequently were the more
expos'd to the Outrages and Persecutions of the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet they suffer'd all with as much pa∣tience
as was possible, that they might not be oblig'd
to change their Dwelling. And tho these People
are naturally of a mild and peaceable Temper, the
Governor, or rather the Tyrant, with the Ministers
of his Cruelty, resolv'd to treat the <HI>Indians</HI> of this
<PB N="29" REF="23"/>
Province after the same manner he had done those
of other Kingdoms. Here he committed so many
Enormities, such Robberies and Massacres, that 'tis
impossible for any Pen to relate 'em all. He sent
50 Troopers into this Province, which is bigger than
the Country of <HI>Rousillon,</HI> who massacred almost all
the Inhabitants, without any regard to Age, Sex or
Quality. If these poor Creatures fail'd to bring
'em a certain measure of Corn which they exacted
of 'em, or did not send into their Service such a
number of Slaves as they demanded, they kill'd 'em
without Mercy. And this being a plain Country
(as has been said) there was no place to shelter 'em
from the Spanish Horse, who pursu'd 'em with the
utmost Fury.</P>
<P>The General permitted these Villains to commit
all the Insolencies and Robberies they pleas'd, and
to take as great a number of Prisoners as they desir'd.
These they sometimes loaded with Chains of sixty
or eighty Pound weight; so that of 4000 Captives,
scarce six were able to endure this Fatigue, the rest
all dy'd by the way under the intolerable weight of
their Fetters. That they might not have the trouble
to open the Chains of such as dy'd with Hunger,
Thirst, Weariness and Toil, they cut off their
Heads. When the <HI>Indians</HI> saw the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pre∣pare
for these kind of Journeys, well knowing they
were never likely to see their Friends and Country∣men
any more, they, with many deep Sighs and
Groans, and floods of Tears, utter'd their Com∣plaints
after this manner. <HI>Time was</HI> (say they)
<HI>when we have travell'd these Journeys to serve the Christi∣ans,
and have been suffer'd after a certain space of time
to return home to our Wives and Children, but now there
is no hope of any such return; and this Separation must
be for ever.</HI></P>
<P>One day a Fancy came into the Governors Head,
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
to make a new distribution of the <HI>Indians;</HI> he took
'em away from those for whom he had no kindness,
and gave a greater number to those he respected.
This chopping and changing of Slaves occasion'd a
great scarcity for one Year, there being but a very
small Crop on the ground. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> endea∣vour'd
to supply this defect by taking from the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
all the Corn and other Provisions which they
had laid up in store for the Subsistence of their
Families. This Disorder produc'd a Famin among
'em, which destroy'd above thirty thousand People.
There was one Woman so intolerably press'd with
Hunger, that she kill'd her Child to appease her
Appetite.</P>
<P>All the Cities and Fields round 'em are like plea∣sant
Gardens, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cultivated ac∣cording
to the share each one had assign'd him by
Lot: and to save their own Revenues, they fed up∣on
the Stores that belong'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and liv'd
at their Charge, devouring in a few days what these
poor People had been a long time getting together
with a great deal of Care and Toil. There was
no <HI>Spaniard</HI> but had an Estate of his own, and kept
abundance of <HI>Indians</HI> in his House to manure his
Land, and to do other Domestick Business: and none
of these were exempted from Slavery, their Nobles,
their Women and Children were made to work day
and night for the advantage of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
exacted Tasks of 'em quite beyond their Strength,
and miserably wore 'em out with excess of Labour
and Hardship. They drove 'em out of their Houses,
and took possession of 'em; they seiz'd their Goods
and Lands, and instantly consum'd their Provisions,
thus reducing 'em to extreme necessity. Many of 'em
dy'd under the heavy Burdens they oblig'd 'em to
carry on their Shoulders as far as the Port, which was
above 30 Leagues; for hither they made 'em bring
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>
Planks and pieces of Timber for the building of
Vessels. They forc'd 'em to go and seek for Honey
and Wax in the Mountains, where they were de∣vour'd
by Tygers: Women big with Child were
not exempted from these hard Services, and often
perish'd together with their Fruit, under the pressure
of this rigorous Slavery.</P>
<P>That which contributed yet farther to unpeople
this Province, was the liberty the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took to
exact of the <HI>Caciques,</HI> and richest <HI>Indians,</HI> a great
number of Slaves. This kind of Tribute was au∣thoriz'd
by the Governor, and levied with a great
deal of Severity; for he threaten'd to burn 'em alive
if they fail'd to send him a Recruit of fifty Slaves
every three Months, or as often as he should give
order: tho the <HI>Indians</HI> have no great number of
Slaves ordinarily, and 'tis much if a <HI>Cacique</HI> has three
or four among his other Domesticks. If a Father
had two Children, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would take away
one of them, or two if he had three: The Parents
must submit, with how great Reluctancy soever; but
their Children were not ravish'd from 'em without
abundance of Tears and dolorous Complaints; for
they have a very tender Affection to their Off∣spring,
and breed 'em up with abundance of Care.
This kind of Tribute being often extorted, all this
Kingdom was in a few years depopulated. There
arriv'd five or six Ships here every year, which were
laden with Slaves, whom they transported into
<HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> and there sold 'em, where they
died in a little time; for it has been confirm'd by
many Experiments, that those <HI>Indians</HI> that are trans∣ported
from their Native Country into other Cli∣mats,
seldom live long: And that which contri∣buted
to kill 'em the sooner, was the neglect of sup∣plying
'em with sufficient Sustenance, and the ex∣cessive
Labour with which they were over-charg'd.
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>
In the space of a few Years there were above
500000 Slaves drawn out of this Province, tho they
were all burn free: and during the War that was
made against 'em, there dy'd about fifty or sixty
thousand besides these: the rest were condemn'd to
cruel Slavery, in which a considerable number dy'd
every day. There are about four or five thousand
People still to be found in this Province; but it was
once one of the best peopled Countries in all <HI>Ame∣rica:</HI>
And in a little time in all appearance the rest
will be destroy'd by the ill Treatment they conti∣nually
suffer.</P>

<HEAD>Of New Spain.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NEw Spain</HI> was discover'd in the year 1517, and
the year following the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to ra∣vage
it, and to massacre the Inhabitants, tho they
pretend to go out of <HI>Europe</HI> to people this Country.
Their Violences and Oppressions arriv'd to such a
height, that they had no regard either to God or
the King, but forgot both that they were Men and
Christians. Since they came into this Country, there
has been nothing but Rapine and Spoil, Massacres,
and buring of Cities, nothing but Tyranny and
Violence; so that they have in a short time depo∣pulated
and ruined vast Kingdoms from one end to
t'other. The remembrance of the Villanies and
Cruelties committed there, has cast such a Terror
into the minds of the Natives, that they can't think
of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> without trembling. They have not
yet left off tormenting 'em; on the contrary
they rather grow worse and worse, and their Perse∣cutions
augment every year. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> since
they first enter'd into <HI>New Spain</HI> have destroy'd
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>
450000 by violent Deaths in and about <HI>Mexico.</HI>
This Country contains four or five Kingdoms, that
come not short of the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> for Ex∣tent,
Fertility, and Plenty of all things: Here were
Cities to be seen more populous than <HI>Toledo, Seville,
Vallidolid, Saragossa,</HI> or <HI>Barcelona;</HI> for tho all these
Cities are well stor'd with Inhabitants, those of the
new World are yet more populous. The Country
of which I am now treating is above 1800 Leagues
in compass. Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have kill'd above
four Millions of People by Fire and Sword, and o∣ther
violent Deaths, both Men, Women and Chil∣dren,
within the space of 480 Leagues. They call
the Countries they have got by their unjust and
cruel Wars, their Conquests, into which they en∣ter'd
with the bloody design of exterminating the
Inhabitants, and behav'd themselves worse than
<HI>Turks,</HI> or the greatest Enemies of the Christian
Name would have done. I don't now reckon in the
number of those they have kill'd, such as have pe∣rish'd
in Slavery, or dy'd under the Hardships of
their Tyrannical Oppressions. No Tongue is capa∣ble
of describing to the life all the horrid Villanies
perpetrated by these bloody-minded Men. They
seem to be the declar'd Enemies of Mankind, and
act as if they were destin'd to destroy the whole
Human Race: And how accuratly soever one en∣deavours

<HI>Spaniards,</HI> the thousandth part of it cannot be

<HEAD>A more particular Account of New Spain.</HEAD>
<P>IN the flourishing and famous City of <HI>Cholula,</HI>
which contain'd more than thirty thousand Fa∣milies,
the principal Inhabitants, together with the
Priests, led by him whom they look'd upon as their
High-priest, came with abundance of Solemnity and
Pomp to meet the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and that they might
receive 'em with the greater Honour and Respect,
they had order'd matters so amongst themselves,
that those of the highest quality in the City should
conduct the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to their Houses, and give 'em
the best Entertainment they could. Notwithstand∣ing
this, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> resolv'd upon the spot to
make a horrible slaughter of 'em, thereby to render
themselves the more formidable, and to spread Ter∣ror
through all the Country. And this method they
us'd to observe in every Country through which
they pass'd, <HI>viz.</HI> to make a great Massacre at their
first Arrival, that the People, who are as meek as
Sheep, might not look upon 'em without dread.
They deputed some to go and treat with the chief
Men of the City, and places adjacent, to engage
'em to come and meet 'em, that they might confer
together. These were no sooner come to 'em, but
they put 'em in Chains, while the Inhabitants of
the City knew nothing of this Treachery. They
demanded 6000 <HI>Indians</HI> of 'em to carry their Bag∣gage,
their Utensils and Provisions: When they
were come, they shut 'em up in divers Yards, and
'twas a miserable Spectacle to see the poor Wretches
prepare to carry the Burdens they were to lay upon
'em. They were almost stark naked, and stoop'd
down prostrating themselves upon the Ground, sub∣mitting
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
like Sheep to the Blows and Wounds these
Tyrants gave 'em. When they were all thus pound∣ed
in several Courts or Yards, part of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
arm'd with Lances and Pikes fill'd up the Avenues
to hinder the <HI>Indians</HI> from escaping, while the rest
put 'em to the Sword; so that none of these escap'd.
Two or three days after they found some of them
among the Carcases all cover'd with Wounds and
Blood, that had been left for dead; these cry'd for
Mercy, and beg'd they might be suffer'd to live;
but these bloody Men were not at all soften'd by
their Groans and Tears, and the submissive manner
in which they ask'd their Lives, but cut 'em in pieces
upon the spot with a kind of nameless Cruelty.
Above a hundred of the principal <HI>Indians</HI> of this
place were put in Irons, and kept alive as yet:
But the Commander of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> order'd Stakes
to be fix'd in the Ground, and these unhappy Peo∣ple
to be fasten'd to 'em and burnt. The King of
the Country happen'd to make his Escape, and re∣tir'd
into a Temple with thirty or forty attending
him, hoping to find Sanctuary there: Here he de∣fended
himself for a whole day. But the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who never gave Quarter to any one whom they
found in Arms, set fire to the Temple, and burnt
all that were in it. They cry'd out of the midst
of the Flames: <HI>O vile and cruel Men! what hurt have
we done you, that you should kill us after this manner?
Be gone, be gone to</HI> Mexico, <HI>where our King</HI> Monte∣çuma
<HI>will punish you according to your deserts.</HI> 'Tis
said the Spanish Commander was at play during this
Tragedy; and that when the Flames had quite con∣sum'd
these poor <HI>Indians,</HI> in a Transport of barba∣rous
Joy, shall I say? or Fury, he utter'd these words:
<HI>Nero,</HI> says he, <HI>beholding from Mount</HI> Tarpeius <HI>the
Flames that laid</HI> Rome <HI>in Ashes,</HI> heard the Cries of his
Citizens without any Emotion of Compassion.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="27"/>
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made another great Massacre in
the City of <HI>Tepeaca,</HI> which is a yet finer and larger
City than the former, and comprehends in it a
greater number of Houses. Here they kill'd a mul∣titude
of the Inhabitants with their Lances and
Swords. They afterwards went to <HI>Mexico,</HI> where
King <HI>Monteçuma</HI> accompanied with his Nobles, and
those of the most distinguished Rank in his Court,
entertain'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with all sorts of Divertise∣ments,
to testify how mightily they were pleas'd
with their Arrival. The King's Brother came to
meet 'em with a splendid Retinue; he made 'em
noble Presents in Gold and Silver, and gave 'em
rich Stuffs painted with divers Colours: the King
himself receiv'd 'em at the entrance of the City with
all his Court, being carried upon a Golden Frame, or
Chair of State, and conducted 'em to the Palace
that was provided for 'em. But the same day they
seiz'd this unfortunate Prince, who thought of no∣thing
less, and posted fourscore Souldiers to guard
him, having loaded him with a heavy Chain. This
Action put all the <HI>Indians</HI> in a Consternation and
Fear. But to augment their Terror, they contriv'd
to signalize their Cruelty by some memorable Action.
All the Nobility of the City was engag'd in repre∣senting
Plays and Shows, and in dancing round the
place where their King was imprison'd, to allay the
Troubles of his Mind during his Captivity; in these
Plays they expos'd to view all their Riches and Mag∣nificence.
These were the Demonstrations of their
Joy, and of the desire they had to please the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI>
The Nobles and Princes of the Blood, ac∣cording
to their several degrees, were employ'd in
these Plays and Dances (as I have said) round about
their Prince's Prison; so that there were about the
Palace two thousands young Men that were the very
flower of the whole Kingdom, and the Pride and
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>
Glory of the Court of King <HI>Monteçuma:</HI> While
they were thus engag'd, the Commander of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> with one of his Troops came to fall upon
'em. He had sent the rest of his Souldiers into the
other quarters of the City, where the People were
using the like Divertisements, ordering 'em to seem
to join in with these Indian Sports, as if they were
mightily pleas'd with 'em, but withal giving 'em a
word to put these Dancers at a certain time to the
Sword. Accordingly they fell upon 'em, pro∣nouncing
the word <HI>St. James,</HI> which was the Signal
for massacring these poor naked <HI>Indians,</HI> that were
in no condition to defend themselves from Souldiers
arm'd with Swords and Lances: with these they
made large Wounds in the tender Bodies of the
young Noblemen of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who were all massacred,
and not so much as one of 'em escap'd. The <HI>Indians</HI>
in the other parts of the City were seiz'd with so
much Horror and Trouble, that they knew not
where to seek for shelter to secure themselves from
the fury of these Cut-throats, whom they loaded
with a thousand Curses. Since this time they don't
forget to celebrate the memory of this barbarous
Action with their Sighs and Tears, and have put
this day in the Rank of their most unfortunate ones,
since in it they lost in a moment the most illustrious
Nobility of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> who had suffer'd the Imprisonment of
their King with so much patience, hearing of the
Massacre of so many young Noblemen, could not
but express their Detestation of this so bloody and
wicked a Fact, and took up Arms to revenge them∣selves:
and tho <HI>Monteçuma</HI> had forbidden 'em to
offer the <HI>Spaniards</HI> any Violence, they attack'd 'em
vigorously, and kill'd divers of 'em, and the rest were
constrained to retreat. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> put a Dagger
to their Prince's Breast, and shew'd him in this
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>
posture to his Subjects through a Window, hoping
the sight of it would oblige 'em to lay down their
Arms, which the Prince himself likewise command∣ed
them to do; but they were too much provok'd
now to obey even his Orders. They chose one to
head 'em, and having put all their Troops under
his Command, attack'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> so furiously,
and fought with so much obstinacy, that these con∣cluding
they were not able to withstand 'em, left
the City, and retreated in the middle of the night;
which the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving, pursu'd 'em, and kill'd
a great number of 'em as they pass'd the Rivers.
However the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return'd soon after with a
greater Strength, and assaulted and took the City,
in which they made a horrible slaughter, and burnt
those <HI>Indians</HI> that were of greatest Note.</P>
<P>After they had committed all this Cruelty and
Spoil in the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> they carried Desolation
with them into the Province of <HI>Panuco,</HI> which is
not above twenty Leagues distant from it, and here
exercised their ordinary Barbarity. This Province
was mightily stock'd with People: but since the ar∣rival
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the greatest part of 'em has
been cut off. The Province of <HI>Tute-peca,</HI> and that
of <HI>Colima</HI> underwent the same Fate; each of which
Provinces is as big as the Kingdoms of <HI>Leon</HI> and
<HI>Castile.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis to be observ'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> invaded
these Provinces only to plunder and inslave the In∣habitants.
One of the first things they did was to
oblige 'em to take the Oath of Allegiance to the
King of <HI>Spain;</HI> which if they refus'd to do, they
were presently massacred, or made Slaves. They
declar'd those of 'em Rebels who came not to meet
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to submit to their unjust and cruel
Orders. Those of the highest rank among the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
were accus'd of this Crime, and this was im∣prov'd
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
against 'em to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> without
considering that 'tis a plain Rule in Law, that none
can be term'd Rebels but Subjects that are revolted
from their Prince.</P>
<P>There's no good Christian will make any dif∣ficulty
to conclude, that such Missionaries as the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have not the Qualifications necessary to
insinuate the Maxims of our Religion into these
People, who are naturally free, and know not how
to bear the Haughtiness and Insolence with which
they have been treated: for they are peremptorily
told, you must without any more ado submit to the
Obedience of a Foreign Prince, whom you never
saw nor heard of; and if you refuse so to do, we'll
cut you in pieces; and this no sooner said but done.
But that which is more unaccountable is, that those
who yield a blind Obedience to all they command
'em, are no better treated than the others; for they
are made miserable Slaves, they exact intolerable
Tasks of 'em, and condemn 'em to all sorts of Tor∣ments:
So that whole Provinces, both Men, Women
and Children, are destroy'd in a short time: Nay,
those whom they kill outright are the happier sort,
as having an end put to their Miseries in a moment.
But when they are forc'd by Menaces to promise
Fidelity and Obedience to a Foreign Prince, can it
be pretended they are oblig'd to it in Conscience,
when this suppos'd Duty is neither founded on the
Laws of God, nor those of Nations? Besides, the
Threatnings that are made 'em are capable of ter∣rifying
Men of the greatest Courage and Resolu∣tion;
wherefore all the Promises obtain'd by such
menaces have no value nor obliging force. I pass
over in silence the Affronts, the Insults and Injuries
that were offer'd the King of <HI>Mexico.</HI> In a word,
they have violated all the Laws of Nations, and
infinitely wrong'd and abus'd the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> This
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>
is all the Service the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have done these
People.</P>
<P>The Governor of this new World, supported by
his imaginary Titles, sent two Captains, scarce in∣ferior
to himself in Impiety aad Cruelty, into the
Kingdoms of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> which are situate towards
the South: they pierc'd as far as the Kingdoms of
<HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Gaymura,</HI> which extend Northward for
the space of about 300 Leagues; these Kingdoms
border upon that of <HI>Mexico.</HI> These Captains tra∣vell'd
both by Sea and Land, accompanied with a
good party of Horse, and a considerable number of
Foot.</P>
<P>The Captain whose Lot it was to travel into <HI>Gua∣timala,</HI>
did a world of mischief there (the other
soon dying) he carried Desolation with him every
where, and fill'd this Kingdom with Blood and Ruin,
to render the <HI>Spaniards</HI> formidable even to future
Generations. I am of opinion, that the mischief this
Captain did here surpass'd whatever the <HI>Europeans</HI>
had done before in the new World. He went by
Sea, and carried Sword and Fire throughout all the
Coasts. Some of the Inhabitants of the Kingdom
of <HI>Yucatan,</HI> which is in the way to the Kingdoms of
<HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Gaymura,</HI> made him magnificent Presents:
yet as soon as he had enter'd their Country, he sent
his Souldiers into every part of it, who committed
horrible Spoil, and massacred an infinite number of
these poor People. A furious <HI>Spaniard</HI> at the head
of 300 Men, enter'd the Country adjoining to <HI>Gua∣timala,</HI>
set fire to all their Cities, and cut the throats
of all the Inhabitants, without giving any quarter:
he carried away what Booty he could, and continued
to pillage the Country for the space of sixscore
Leagues. This Captain had rebell'd, and revolted
against his General; and his design in ruining the
Country after this manner was to put the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>
out of a condition to pursue him, by preventing
their finding Subsistence in a Country thus ruin'd,
and by exposing 'em to the fury of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who
would omit nothing to revenge upon 'em the Injuries
and Mischiefs they had receiv'd from their Com∣panions,
which fell out accordingly: For the Spanish
General attempting to pursue this Rebel, was kill'd
by the <HI>Indians.</HI> Those that succeeded him exer∣cised
all manner of Cruelties on 'em, and reduc'd al∣most
all of 'em to Slavery, after they had spoil'd 'em
of all their Goods, Provisions, Clothes, Corn, Wine
and other necessaries of Life. The Provinces of
<HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Hondure,</HI> which were like Gardens of
Pleasure, were turn'd into melancholy Deserts, al∣tho
this Country was very full of People. 'Tis
impossible to reflect on these things without being
sensibly touch'd and soften'd into Compassion, tho
one were naturally of an obdurate and sowr Tem∣per.
They kill'd two Millions of People in this
Country in less than ten years; so that there are
scarce two thousand left in all the vast Extent of it;
and these are groaning under a heavy yoke of Bon∣dage.
When they propos'd to 'em to take the Oath
of Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they would
give 'em no time to deliberate; they must imme∣diately
obey, or else die by Fire or Sword.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Kingdom of Guatimala.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> signaliz'd their entrance into this
Kingdom by divers Massacres, tho the King
came to meet 'em in his Chair of State supported
by his Slaves, follow'd by a great number of his Lords,
and with Trumpets and Drums before him, to give
the greater Testimony of Joy; he shew'd 'em all
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>
the Courtesy and Civility in the world, manifested
a great deal of Kindness in readily supplying 'em
with plenty of Provisions, and gave 'em whatever
they could reasonably desire. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> lodg'd
without the City the first night, thinking they should
not be secure enough in a place so well fortified.
The next day they engag'd the Prince of the place
to come out to 'em with the greatest part of the
Persons of Quality, obliging to bring with them a
certain quantity of Gold. The <HI>Indians</HI> made answer
that 'twas impossible for them to do what was re∣quir'd,
because their Country did not yield this Me∣tal.
However this refusal so mov'd the Indignation
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that for no other Offence, without
any formal Process, they cast 'em all alive into a
great Fire. The most considerable Inhabitants of
these Provinces, seeing their Masters so cruelly
treated, only because they gave not the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
all the Gold they demanded, retir'd with all speed
into the Mountains, ordering the common People
to submit to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as their Masters, and
giving 'em a strict charge by no means to give the
least notice of the places where they were gone to
hide themselves. Abundance of these poor People
came accordingly to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> begging of 'em
to receive them into the number of their Servants,
and promising to serve 'em faithfully as far as they
were capable. The Spanish Commander roughly
answer'd 'em, that he would not so receive 'em, but
cut 'em to pieces without Mercy, unless they would
discover the places whither their Masters were re∣treated;
the <HI>Indians</HI> replied, they did not know:
however they readily offer'd themselves, their
Wives and Children to their Service; and said, they
would continue in their Houses expecting their Or∣ders;
they further told 'em, they might treat 'em
as they pleas'd, 'twas in their power either to kill
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>
'em, or to save 'em alive to employ 'em in their
service. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this went into their
Villages and Towns, and found these poor <HI>Indians</HI>
with their Wives and Children busy at their Work,
and in great security, believing they had no need to
fear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would attack 'em; yet these blood-thirsty
Men massacred 'em without pity. After
this they went to another great Town, the Inha∣bitants
of which confiding in their Innocence, thought
themselves in no great danger; but this whole Town
was destroy'd in less than two hours, and the Mas∣sacre
was so general, that no Age, nor Sex, nor
Quality met with Pity, but all were put to the
Sword, unless such as fled before the arrival of the
<HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> at length finding it impossible either
by their Patience, their Submissions, or their Presents
to soften the cruel and savage Temper of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
who cut their Throats without any reason,
or any sentiment of Pity, resolv'd to get together
in a body, and take Arms to defend themselves: for
seeing Death was inevitable to 'em, and become a ne∣cessary
Evil, they chose rather to die with Weapons
in their hands, thereby to sell their Lives at as dear
a rate as they could, and to revenge themselves as
much as possible on their Persecutors, than to suffer
their Throats to be cut like Sheep without making
any resistance. They wanted effectual Arms, they
were quite naked, and knew their Strength was
much inferior to that of their Enemies; they had
no Horses, nor did they understand the use of 'em
in Battel: they had to do with a furious and warlike
Enemy that gave 'em no quarter, and design'd no∣thing
but their Extirpation. They therefore thought
it necessary to use Stratagems: it came into their
heads to make Pits up and down the ways by which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to pass, and to cover 'em with
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
Straw and Leaves that they might not be perceiv'd,
that so their Horses might fall in 'em, and break their
Necks or Legs. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were two or
three times taken in these Traps, but afterwards
took care to avoid 'em, and resolv'd to cast all the
<HI>Indians</HI> they could take into these Pits, whether
Men, Women or Children, of what Age or Con∣dition
soever; they threw in Women big with
Child, and old Men as well as others, till they had
quite fill'd 'em. It was a most lamentable sight to
see some Women empaled together with their Chil∣dren,
and so expos'd to the fury of greedy Dogs,
and others run through with Lances and Halberts.
They burnt one of the greatest Lords of the Coun∣try
with a gentle Fire, and insultingly told him 'twas
to do him the more honour, that they put him to
death after this manner. These Butcheries and Cru∣elties
were committed for seven years together.
The Reader may conjecture what multitudes of poor
<HI>Indians</HI> were slaughter'd during so tedious and
bloody a Persecution.</P>
<P>'Tis fit to be remark'd, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were
receiv'd with great Acclamations, and with all the
demonstrations of a sincere Joy in the Province of
<HI>Cuzcatan,</HI> which is situate on the Sea-side, and ex∣tends
forty or fifty Leagues in length. In this Pro∣vince
is the famous City of <HI>St. Saviour; Cuzcatan</HI> is
the Metropolis of the Province. These People sent
30000 <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> laden with Indian
Poultry, and all other Provisions the Country would
afford in great abundance. After they had receiv'd
these Presents, the Spanish General order'd his Men
to choose as many <HI>Indians</HI> as each of 'em desir'd for
their Service, while they remain'd in that Province:
Accordingly one took a hundred, another fifty, as
they had occasion to carry their Baggage. These
poor Wretches serv'd them with all the care and
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>
diligence they could, and were even ready to wor∣ship
'em. At length the General demanded of 'em
a great quantity of Gold, that being the main busi∣ness
for which he came: they with a great deal of
Humility and Submission, told him they would readi∣ly
give him all they had, and presently got together
all the Lances they had, which were made of Cop∣per
gilt, and which they took for pure Gold by the
looks of it. The General soon made trial of it, and
finding what it was, address'd himself to the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in these terms: <HI>We must carry Destruction with
us</HI> (says he) <HI>through all this Country, seeing here's no
Gold to be found: Every one of you may keep the</HI> Indians
<HI>you have chosen for your perpetual Slaves: You may load
'em with Chains, and brand 'em with the marks of their
Slavery:</HI> Which was immediately done: For they
printed the King's Arms with a hot Iron upon all
they could take. Those of 'em that escap'd, provok'd
with the ill Treatment which they every where
met, assembled all the <HI>Indians</HI> they could to make an
Effort to deliver themselves from the Persecutions
of their Enemies by force of Arms; but their En∣terprize
was not successful, so that an incredible
number of 'em was kill'd.</P>
<P>After this Expedition the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return'd to
<HI>Guatimala,</HI> where they built a City; but God was
pleas'd by his just Judgment utterly to overthrow,
and destroy it. They kill'd all without Mercy whom
they suppos'd to be in a condition to incommode
'em by their Arms, and the rest were condemn'd to
Slavery. They extorted from 'em a Tribute of
Boys and Girls, and sent 'em into <HI>Peru</HI> to be sold.
The other Inhabitants of this Kingdom, which is
100 Leagues in length, were likewise destroy'd.
Thus one of the most pleasant and fruitful Countries
in the World was reduc'd to a melancholy Desert.
The Governor himself has freely confess'd, that this
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
was the most populous Country in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
not excepting <HI>Mexico</HI> it self, which is certainly
true. In this noble Country the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have de∣stroy'd
no less than four or five Millions of Men in
fifteen or sixteen years, and continue every day to
treat those that remain after the same manner.</P>
<P>These inhuman Creatures were wont when they
declar'd War against any City or Province, to bring
with 'em as many of the conquer'd <HI>Indians</HI> as they
could, to make 'em fight against their Country-men;
sometimes they had fifteen or twenty thousand of
these new Subjects among 'em. But because they
were not able to furnish 'em with all necessary Pro∣visions,
they allow'd 'em to eat those other <HI>Indians</HI>
whom they took in War, so that in their Camp they
had Shambles stor'd with human Flesh. Infants were
kill'd in their sight, and then broil'd and eaten;
Men were slaughter'd like Beasts, and their Legs
and Arms dress'd for food; for the <HI>Indians</HI> like the
taste of those Parts better than others. The News
of these horrible Practices soon alarm'd the neigh∣bouring
Countries, and fill'd 'em with Terror and
Consternation.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Indians</HI> were worn out with carrying
the Tackle of the Spanish Ships, which they would
needs have brought from the North to the South
Sea, which are 130 Leagues distant: They made
'em carry Anchors of a great weight all this long
way; they laid great Guns upon the naked Backs of
these poor Creatures, under the weight of which
they were not able to stand; so that the greatest
part of 'em dy'd by the way, not being able to en∣dure
these Fatigues. To increase their Misery, they
divided their Families, taking Husbands from their
Wives, and Wives from their Husbands; their
Daughters were taken from 'em, and given to the
Seamen and Souldiers to satisfy their Lust, and to
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
appease their murmuring. They fill'd the Ships
with <HI>Indians,</HI> and suffer'd 'em to perish with Hunger
and Thirst; because they would take no care to fur∣nish
'em with Necessaries. But to give a particular
account of all their Cruelties would require large
Volumes, the view of which would astonish all that
should have the curiosity to look into 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had two powerful Fleets destin'd
to the same purpose of destroying the poor <HI>Indians.</HI>
How many Parents have they bereav'd of their
Children! How many Children of their Parents!
of how many Adulteries and other infamous Practi∣ces
have they been the Causes, the Actors, and Ac∣complices!
How many People have they inslav'd!
What Miseries and Calamities have they not brought
upon this new World! What Fountains of Tears
have they open'd! What Rivers of Blood have they
pour'd out! How many Lives have they taken away
after such a manner as might render 'em yet more
miserable in the other World! which is a melan∣choly
Reflection both in regard of the <HI>Indians</HI> who
have suffer'd so many Cruelties, and of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
who have been the Authors of so much Mischief and
Villany.</P>

<HEAD>Of New Spain, of Panuco and Xalisco.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had committed all the fore∣mention'd
Cruelties and Massacres in <HI>New
Spain,</HI> there came to <HI>Panuco</HI> another Tyrant as bar∣barous
and unmerciful as the former. He loaded his
Ships with multitudes of the Natives, and carried
'em to <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where they were sold
for Slaves: so that in a little time he render'd the
whole Country destitute of People. Fourscore of
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>
these <HI>Indians</HI> (tho they have reasonable Souls as
well as other Men) were exchang'd for one Horse.
When the President of the City of <HI>Mexico</HI> was made
Governor of all <HI>New Spain,</HI> there were also a great
many Assessors and Auditors made, who all rul'd
like so many petty Tyrants, and committed un∣parallel'd
Cruelties and Outrages in the exercise
of their Offices. They acted such abominable things,
and made the Country so desolate in a very little
time, that if the Franciscan Monks had not oppos'd
their Disorders with a great deal of Courage and
Resolution, and had not the Royal Council by their
Messages given Orders for the preservation of this
Province, all <HI>New Spain</HI> had been ruin'd in less than
two years, and been made as desolate as <HI>Hispaniola.</HI>
One of the President's Companions employ'd eight
thousand <HI>Indians</HI> to make a Wall round his Garden,
but he gave 'em neither Wages nor Victuals; so
that they almost all dy'd before the Work was fi∣nish'd:
neither the hard Labour they endur'd, nor
their Death could make this merciless Man relent.</P>
<P>After the former General, of whom we have
spoken above, had made an end of destroying and
wasting the Province of <HI>Panuco,</HI> and was inform'd
that the Royal Council would arrive in a little
time, he advanc'd farther into the Country, hoping
to find some new Province on which to exercise his
wonted Rapine. He forc'd fifteen or twenty thou∣sand
<HI>Indians</HI> to attend him, to carry the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
Baggage and Provisions, which they did till they
all died in the way except two hundred. He came
at length into the Province of <HI>Mechuaca,</HI> about forty
Leagues from <HI>Mexico.</HI> The King of this Province
very civilly came out to meet him, and was as offi∣cious
to serve him as could be desir'd; but for his
reward was loaded with Irons, because suppos'd to
have a great Treasure by him; and the better to
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>
extort great Sums from him, he was made to suffer
a great many Torments. His Hands being tied to
a Stake, and his Legs stretch'd out, they drop'd
burning Pitch on 'em, and basted his Body with
boiling Oil from time to time, that his Skin might
be gradually roasted. Over against him stood a fu∣rious
Souldier with a Bow shooting Arrows into his
Breast: Another let loose hungry Dogs to bite and
tear him in every part; all these Tortures were to
make him confess where he had hid his Gold: And
these Cruelties would have been continued longer
if a Franciscan Frier had not happen'd to come and
rescue him out of their hands; however he could
not save his Life, for he expir'd soon after. Many
<HI>Caciques</HI> and great Men of this Province were put to
death after this manner, to make 'em confess where
they had hid their Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>About this time there arriv'd another Person in
this Country, who was more greedy of Money, than
solicitous about the Salvation of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI>
He happen'd to find some of their Idols which they
had hid, (for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would very seldom give
themselves the trouble to inform these Idolaters of
the True God) Upon this he imprison'd the most
considerable Persons in the Nation, till they should
discover to him where they had put their Idols, be∣cause
he suppos'd theirs were made either of Gold
or Silver; but he fail'd in his Expectation: however
to mend the matter, he impos'd great Sums on the
<HI>Indians,</HI> which they were to pay for the redemption
of their Idols, that they might worship 'em after
their wonted manner. These are the Improvements
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have been making in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
and this is their Zeal for the Glory of God and Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>After this Tyrant had run through the whole
Province of <HI>Mechuaca,</HI> and pillaged it, he came to
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
<HI>Xalisquo,</HI> a Country very populous and fruitful, and
the most famous in all <HI>America;</HI> there are Towns
in it of seven Leagues in length. These <HI>Indians,</HI> as
the others had done before, came out to meet him
with great expressions of Joy; but he soon left up∣on
'em the marks of his Cruelty, which he had cul∣tivated
by long Experience. The noble Presents
made this Tiger could not mollify him. His design
was to heap together a great quantity of Gold, this
was the only Idol he ador'd; and all means were in∣different
to him, so he could but attain his end.
He set fire to all the Cities through which he pass'd,
and destroy'd 'em to the very Foundation. He kept
those of the highest Dignity prisoners, after he had
inflicted divers kinds of Torments on 'em. The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> loaded all the <HI>Indians</HI> they could take here
with Chains, which was a great number. The Soul∣diers
made Women big with Child carry their Bag∣gage,
till they fainted and sunk under their Burdens
with hunger and weariness. Others not able to
carry both the heavy Burdens they gave 'em, and
their Children too, were forc'd to leave these by the
way, by which means a prodigious number of Chil∣dren
perish'd.</P>
<P>A <HI>Spaniard</HI> attempting to ravish a Virgin in the
presence of her Mother, the Mother did what she
could to hinder him; upon which, to prevent her
from farther opposing his brutish design, he drew
his Sword and cut off her Arms, and afterwards
kill'd her Daughter because she would by no means
consent to his filthy Desires, but resisted him with
a virtuous Indignation and Courage to her last
breath.</P>
<P>Four thousand and five hundred of these poor <HI>In∣dians</HI>
were branded with a hot Iron by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who mark'd 'em thus for Slaves, tho they were
born free and independent. The very Children,
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>
as well as those that were grown to maturity, suffer'd
this Punishment and Infamy: They pretended they
had right to make a great number of 'em Slaves,
to defray the Charge of their long Travels; and
that they might lawfully make these poor Creatures
endure all sorts of Torments, to force 'em to de∣clare
where they had hid their Gold: Some of 'em
they burnt, others were torn in pieces by hungry
Dogs; they cut off the Feet, Hands, Arms, Tongues,
and sometimes the Heads of others, to terrify the
rest by these sad Spectacles, that they might oblige
'em the more easily to submit to Slavery, or to shew
'em the places where they had secur'd their Trea∣sure.
And all these things were acted with the
knowledg and consent of the Governor, who would
sometimes order more Blows to be given 'em, when
they were beat or whip'd, to compleat their Mi∣sery.</P>
<P>Fourscore Towns and Villages at least were burnt
in the Kingdom of <HI>Xalisco:</HI> Which tragical sight,
together with all the various Cruelties they suffer'd
every day, so provok'd the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they arm'd
themselves and fell upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and kill'd
some of 'em: after which Expedition they fled up
into the Mountains, but at length were massacred in
this place of Refuge by other <HI>Spaniards</HI> who made
Excursions through these Provinces to lay 'em waste.
They put all of 'em to the Sword who made any
offer to defend themselves, so that this place became
a horrible scene of Blood: And there is scarce any
Remnant of this once numerous People left. The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were certainly blinded, harden'd and aban∣don'd
by the Almighty, that they made no Reflection
on the Laws of God or Men, which all forbid the
exercise of such Violence as they have been guilty
of in <HI>America.</HI> They had no just occasion given 'em
to drive the Inhabitants of those Provinces from
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
their Native Country by force of Arms, and to
massacre 'em so barbarously: they did not consider
how unjust and criminal these Outrages were, and
how contrary it was to all the Laws of Nations, for
them to treat those who had never injur'd 'em with
so much Cruelty. They pretend the Wars they
have made against these People are just and lawful;
that God hath left 'em to their Mercy, and that
they have right to make such Conquests as these,
and to destroy all these Nations: So that it seems
they would fain make God himself Partner with 'em
in their Tyranny and Wickedness; and one may
well apply the words of the Prophet <HI>Zechariah</HI> to
'em: <HI>Feed the flock of the slaughter; whose Possessors
slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that
sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich; and
their own Shepherds pity them not.</HI> Chap. 11. 4, 5.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Kingdom of Yucatan.</HEAD>
<P>A Very profligate Person who had neither Ho∣nour
nor Conscience, was made Governor of
the Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan</HI> in the year 1526; which
Dignity he procur'd by his Lies and Artifices, and
the false accounts of Matters which he sent to the
King of <HI>Spain.</HI> A method which other Tyrants
have hitherto likewise follow'd to obtain places of
Trust: For under the umbrage of the Title of Go∣vernor,
which seems to give some Dignity and Au∣thority
to all they do, they take the liberty to ex∣ercise
their Robberies and Violences with Impunity.
The Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan</HI> contain'd a prodigious
number of People; the Air of this Country is very
temperate and pleasant: it has great plenty of
Fruits, and all the Necessaries of Life; it exceeds
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
<HI>Mexico</HI> it self in Fertility: There is more Wax and
Honey found in this than in any other part of <HI>America</HI>
that has been yet discover'd. This Kingdom is 300
Leagues in compass. The Inhabitants of it are more
polite, more civiliz'd, and better disciplin'd in Morals,
and in what belongs to the good order of Societies,
than the rest of the <HI>Indians.</HI> There is a remarkable
Prudence and Justness of Mind in them, which is not
to be found in others. These natural Endowments
without doubt ought to have encouraged Christians
to take the pains to instruct 'em in the knowledg of
the true God; and they seem'd to have no small
disposition to receive the Maxims of the Catholick
Religion. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> might have built great and
flourishing Cities in so pleasant and commodious a
Country, where they might have liv'd in the midst
of Pleasure and Plenty, as it were in another Earth∣ly
Paradise: but their Stupidity, their Avarice, and
the enormous Crimes they have committed in <HI>Ameri∣ca</HI>
have render'd 'em unworthy of these Advantages.
They attack'd these poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who liv'd in pro∣found
Peace and Security, with the utmost Violence
of a cruel War, and massacred a prodigious num∣ber
of 'em, tho the number of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was
but three hundred. This Country produces no
Gold; if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could have found any Mines
there, they would have condemn'd the <HI>Indians</HI> to
'em, who must have perish'd with Hunger and Hard∣ship.
These covetous Wretches esteem'd Gold
more than Souls, which were purchas'd by the Blood
of Jesus Christ; they made Slaves of those whom
they sav'd alive, and fill'd the Ships they had brought
to the Coasts of this Kingdom with 'em, and so ex∣chang'd
'em for Wine, Oil, Vinegar, salt Pork,
Horses, and all other Necessaries. They would give
fifty or a hundred of the handsomest young Girls
for a measure of Wine, Oil or Vinegar, and would
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>
sell a hundred or two of lusty well-made young Men
at the same rate. They swop'd a Prince's Son for
a Cheese, and a hundred Persons of Eminency for a
Horse. They continued in this Country till they
heard of the Riches of <HI>Peru,</HI> the News of which
made 'em leave it immediately, and thus their Per∣secutions
ended in the Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan.</HI> How∣ever,
before they went they committed all the Ex∣cesses
and Disorders that can be imagin'd against
both God and Men: so that those three hundred
Leagues of one of the finest Countries in the World,
that was very rich and full of People before their
arrival, were in a little time reduc'd to a vast
Desert.</P>
<P>'Tis not easy to believe the Account of all the
villanous Actions they committed in this Kingdom:
I'll recite but two or three particular Facts. They
had prepar'd fierce Dogs which they kept hungry
to go a hunting after the poor <HI>Indians;</HI> as they were
hunting they lighted on a Woman that was sick,
who not being in a condition to fly to avoid being
devour'd of the Dogs, hang'd her self, after she had
hang'd a Child she had with her of a year old; the
Dogs presently camt to her, and began to devour
her: but a certain Frier that was happily there
perceiving the Child not to be yet quite dead, bap∣tiz'd it.</P>
<P>When they quitted this Kingdom, they invited
the Son of one of the Princes of the Country to
accompany 'em, who shew'd a great unwillingness to
abandon his Country to follow 'em, on which they
threatned to cut him in quarters if he did not con∣sent
to their desire. The Child still persisting in
the same mind, one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> drew his Sword
and cut off both his Ears: This ill Treatment how∣ever
could not make him alter his purpose, upon
which this Brute cut off his Nose and Lips, and
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
laugh'd while he was committing this barbarous
Action.</P>
<P>Another brag'd that he had got many Indian
Women with Child, that he might sell 'em for the
more Money. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have been so in∣human
as to give Infants to their Hounds when they
were hungry: they would take these poor Babes by
the two Legs, and violently tear 'em asunder into
two pieces, and then feed their Dogs with 'em,
They were left of God to such a reprobate mind,
that they made no more account of human Crea∣tures,
that were ransom'd by the Blood of Jesus
Christ, than of Beasts.</P>
<P>I pass over an infinite number of other unheard
of Cruelties, which surpass all Imagination. When
these covetous and ambitious Tyrants left the King∣dom
of <HI>Yucatan</HI> to go in search after the greater
Riches of <HI>Peru,</HI> four Franciscan Friers came thither
to comfort these miserable People, and to endeavour
by their preaching to bring those that had escap'd
the fury of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the knowledg of the true
God. The same Friers were very earnestly soli∣cited
by many other <HI>Indians</HI> to come into their
Country likewise to teach 'em the Maxims of their
Religion. They assembled in great companies to
inform themselves what sort of Men these Religious.
Persons were, who call'd one another <HI>Father</HI> and
<HI>Brother,</HI> to inquire into their true designs, and to know
wherein they differ'd from other <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
had exercis'd so much Cruelty over all the <HI>West-Indies.</HI>
They were willing to entertain 'em on con∣dition
they would come alone to instruct 'em, with∣out
any other <HI>Spaniards</HI> to attend 'em; which the
Friers promis'd very readily, assuring 'em they would
not offer 'em the least Injury. The Governor of
<HI>New Spain</HI> likewise now order'd 'em to promise the
<HI>Indians,</HI> that they should be treated more kindly
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>
for the time to come, and should find no farther oc∣casion
to complain of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Severity. Thus
these Religious Men began to preach the Gospel of
Christ with a great deal of Zeal, and inform'd these
People moreover of the good Intentions of the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> towards 'em; so that in about forty days
time, they brought all their Idols to throw 'em in
the fire: they as readily brought their Children,
whom they bring up with a great deal of tenderness
and fondness, to be instructed; and built both Houses
and Churches for these Friers with all the Affection
and Forwardness imaginable. All the several Pro∣vinces
strove with great Emulation for their Com∣pany,
their Zeal was so great for the new Religion
they preach'd to 'em. So that what the Governors
could never obtain of the <HI>Indians</HI> in many years,
these Friers accomplish'd in a very little time: for
the Princes and Great Men of these Provinces, at
the head of their People in a General Assembly,
voluntarily submitted to the Government of the
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whom they acknowledg'd for their
Soveraign, and put themselves under his Protection;
as may be seen by the account these Friers sent into
<HI>Spain</HI> sign'd with their own hands.</P>
<P>These pious Men were transported with Joy to
find a door open'd to 'em to preach the Gospel in
these vast Provinces, to those that had escap'd the
Barbarity of the several Governors, who had massa∣cred
such prodigious numbers. About this time
there came into these parts eighteen Spanish Troo∣pers
with twelve foot Souldiers, who brought with
them abundance of Indian Idols which they had
taken out of other Provinces; the Commander of
these Souldiers sent for one of the principal Chiefs of
the Nation, and commanded him to take these Idols
and distribute 'em throughout the Country, and to
bring him Indian Men and Women in exchange for
<PB N="57" REF="37"/>
'em, threatning him with a severe War if he re∣fus'd
to obey him. This Prince was so terrified
with these Menaces, that he carried away all these
Idols, and dispos'd 'em in the several Cities of his
Province, requiring the People in the name of this
Spanish Captain to worship these false Gods, and to
render 'em all the Honour and Service they were
formerly wont to do. To recompense this Action
they gave him liberty to make as many Slaves as he
pleas'd. The <HI>Indians,</HI> frighted with the threatnings
that were made 'em, deliver'd up their own Children;
he that had two gave one, and he that had three
gave two. This was the Event of this impious
Traffick, the <HI>Cacyque</HI> being forced to obey the Or∣ders
of the Spanish Captain. One of these ungodly
Wretches, whose name was <HI>John Garcia,</HI> being taken
dangerously sick, and ready to expire, bethought
himself that he had a considerable number of these
Idols under his Bed; and therefore order'd an In∣dian
Woman that he kept to sell 'em, telling her she
might make a good market of 'em, the matter of
which being very valuable, he told her every Image
was at least fairly worth an Indian in exchange.
This was the <HI>Spaniards</HI> last Will and Testament,
and these were the marks he gave of the pious dis∣position
of his Mind, and in the midst of such Cares
as these he gave up the Ghost. By this Story it may
easily be conjectur'd what good Examples the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
set before the <HI>Indians,</HI> and what progress the
Catholick Religion is likely to make among these
People; who being Eye-witnesses of such Actions as
these, easily perceive that the <HI>Europeans</HI> have so
little sentiment of Religion, that they don't much
care whether poor Infidels be reduc'd to pay the true
God that Worship and Honour they owe him, or
not. It can hardly be said that <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Crime,
who caus'd two Golden Calves to be cast, and ob∣lig'd
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
his Subjects to worship 'em, is more hainous
than that of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who drive such an abo∣minable
trade with Idols, and occasion so much
scandal by this shameful kind of Traffick. This is
the manner of their Conduct and Behaviour in the
new World. They sacrifice every thing to their
detestable Avarice, and sell Christ Jesus himself for
Gold. They are every day renouncing him, and
dishonouring his Religion by the many infamous
Crimes of which they are guilty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> seeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> still continue to
ruin their Country, notwithstanding all the express
Promises the Friers had made 'em that they would
abstain for the future from their wonted Robberies;
and that instead of mending their own Lives, they
brought Idols even from other Countries to expose
to sale among them, who had voluntarily resign'd
their own to the Friers to be committed to the
Flames, being resolv'd to worship but one God in
their Country for time to come: Seeing all this
(I say) they were extremely enrag'd at the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
and no less provok'd against the Friers, whom
they accosted after this manner. <HI>Why</HI> (say they)
<HI>have you deceiv'd us thus by your false Promises? Did
not you assure us the</HI> Spaniards <HI>should no more invade
and oppress us? Why have you burnt our Gods, to bring
us strange Gods out of other Countries? Are these better
or mightier than our own?</HI> The poor Friers endeavor'd
to appease 'em as well as they could, tho they scarce
knew how to answer their Complaints, having no
good Reasons to offer to excuse the matter. How∣ever
they applied themselves to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> re∣proach'd
'em for having so exceedingly scandaliz'd
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and conjur'd 'em to leave the Country,
which they absolutely refus'd to do; and which was
still more vile and unworthy, they perswaded the
<HI>Indians</HI> that they had not come into their Country
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>
but at the request of these Friers: Which pretence
had the success they desired; for the <HI>Indians</HI> giving
credit to these Stories, resolv'd to kill the poor
Friers; but some of 'em giving 'em notice of the
Design, they made their escape in the night. After
they were gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiv'd they were im∣pos'd
on, and receiv'd full information of the Malice
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the base trick they had play'd
'em, and therefore dispatch'd a Message to the Friers
to entreat 'em to return, and forgive the fault they
had committed, assuring 'em they heartily repented
of their Ingratitude.</P>
<P>These pious Men that were devoted to the Ser∣vice
of God, and animated with an ardent Zeal for
the Salvation of Souls, confiding in the Protesta∣tions
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> return'd to 'em according to
their request, and were receiv'd as if they had been
Angels come down from Heaven: they continued
three or four Months among 'em, receiving abun∣dance
of respect and kindness from 'em. The <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
who still refus'd to quit the Country, tho
the Vice-roy had expresly order'd 'em so to do, and
had us'd all his Authority to oblige 'em to it, were
declar'd Rebels and Traitors; however this did not
hinder 'em from continuing their Rapine and Inso∣lence.
And tho the Friers were satisfied they would
not always escape with Impunity, yet they fear'd it
might be a long time before they receiv'd their De∣serts;
and considering moreover that the continual
Insults they made on the <HI>Indians,</HI> depriv'd them of
the liberty of preaching to 'em, upon the whole
they thought meet to resolve to leave this Kingdom,
which was depriv'd of the light of the Gospel by
the Malice of the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> and thus these poor
<HI>Indians</HI> who manifested such good Inclinations to∣ward
Christianity, were abandon'd to their former
Darkness and Idolatry, in which they continue to
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>
this day, while those profligate Wretches still by
the same Obstacles in the way of their Conversion.
When these Friers were constrain'd to retire out of
the Country, the <HI>Indians</HI> began to imbrace the Chris∣tian
Religion with a great deal of Zeal and Fervor;
but being unhappily depriv'd of all means of In∣struction,
they wither'd like tender Plants, for want
of Water.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Province of St. Martha.</HEAD>
<P>THE Province of <HI>St. Martha</HI> was famous for the
rich Golden Mines that are near it, and for
the fruitfulness of its Soil. The People are nume∣rous,
and very skilful in getting Gold out of the
Mines, which easily engag'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to go thi∣ther,
and that in great numbers; they made conti∣nual
Excursions over all this fine Country to ravage
and spoil it; they massacred vast numbers of the
Inhabitants, took away all their Gold, and fill'd their
Ships, which serv'd 'em for Magazines, with the Booty.
They soon laid waste this flourishing Province by
the Robberies and Villanies they committed: they
did the greatest mischief upon the Sea-coasts, but
they soon after pierc'd higher up into the Country,
where they endeavour'd to make a Settlement. The
Country being rich and fertile, divers Spanish Cap∣tains
successively invaded it with their Troops, and
the last was still more cruel and inhuman than his
Predecessor. They seem'd ambitious to outvie one
another in the Enormity of their Crimes and Villa∣nies.
In the year 1520, a Spanish General attended
with a great many Souldiers enter'd into this Pro∣vince
with a resolution of ruining it entirely. He
continued there for seven years together, and carried
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>
away an immense Treasure with him; at last he
was condemn'd to be banish'd, and dyed in his
Exile without shewing the least token of Repen∣tance.
Those who succeeded him went on to mas∣sacre
those <HI>Indians</HI> that he and other Tyrants had
spared; they made both the common People, and
the Nobility of this Province suffer most horrible
Torments, to oblige 'em by the violence of their
pain to discover their Gold: they laid this Coun∣try
waste for above 40 Leagues, not leaving one
soul alive; tho this Province was well stock'd with
Inhabitants before their arrival.</P>
<P><HI>To give a particular Relation of all the Extrava∣gances,
Massacres and Desolations, of all the Impie∣ties
and Villanies committed by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>in this
Province against God, against the King, and against
the innocent</HI> Indians, <HI>would require a large Histo∣ry:
I must therefore content my self to pass over
many Circumstances after a cursory manner. The
Bishop of this Province, writing to the King of</HI>
Spain <HI>in the year 1541, among other things thus
expresses himself:</HI> Great Sir, To redress the Grievances
of this Province, it ought to be deliver'd from the Ty∣ranny
of those that ravage it, and committed to the
Care of Persons of Integrity, who will treat the Inha∣bitants
with more kindness and humanity; for if it be
left to the mercy of the Governours, who commit all sorts
of Outrages with impunity, 'twill be destroy'd in a very
little time. <HI>The same Bishop farther adds in his Let∣ter:</HI>
The ill Conduct of the Governours may well engage
your Majesty to deprive 'em absolutely of their Places,
to relieve these Provinces; and if this course be not
taken, the disease will be incurable. I am necessitated
to let your Majesty know, that the Spaniards who
come into this New World, live here rather like Devils
than Christians; they neither serve God nor the King;
they violate all the Laws of God and Men with Impuni∣ty.
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>
Nothing can be a greater hindrance to the Conversi∣on
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> than the ill Treatment and Persecu∣tion
they make 'em suffer continually. These People na∣turally
love peace and quietness; but the barbarous usage
they meet with from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> inspires 'em with horror
and indignation against all Christians, whom they there∣fore
call in their Language <HI>Yares,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Devils.</HI>
Nor is it without reason that they appear so odious and
abominable to these poor Creatures, since the Actions
they see 'em commit, are more like those of Devils, than
of reasonable Creatures, or Christians. For while the
<HI>Indians</HI> see the Officers as well as Souldiers commit such
detestable Crimes; they believe the Laws of Christianity
authorize these inhuman Actions, and that neither our
God nor our King forbids 'em. 'Tis to no purpose to
pretend to undeceive 'em, and remove these Prejudices,
as the Case stands; 'tis but only to expose the Laws and
Religion of Christ the more to the Contempt of these Ido∣laters.
The <HI>Indians</HI> now begin to defend themselves from
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by force of Arms; and choose rather to
perish together at once than to suffer a thousand deaths by
the Cruelty of these unmerciful Men. Your Majesty has
more Servants in this New World than you imagine;
for there are none who bear Arms in these vast Coun∣tries,
and make it their business to plunder, kill, and
burn, but give out that they are employ'd here in your
Majesty's business, and endeavour to perswade the World
that 'tis by your Majesty's Order, and for your Interest,
that they do all this Mischief to the <HI>Indians:</HI> tho the
Truth is, they use 'em after this violent manner, only
to enrich themselves by plundering 'em of all they have.
It seems absolutely necessary for your Majesty to stop the
Course of these Robbers by some Exemplary Punishment;
and that your Majesty declare you will have none of
their Services, who so highly dishonour God and Religion.</P>
<P>Thus far the Letter which the Bishop of St. <HI>Mar∣tha</HI>
wrote to his Catholick Majesty: By which it
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>
may be conjectur'd how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have abus'd
the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> They in derision and scorn call
those the Warlike <HI>Indians,</HI> that fly into the Moun∣tains
to save their Lives. And when they force
these miserable People, to travel in rough and dif∣cult
ways, sweating under the great Burdens
they oblige 'em to carry, not content with having
overloaded 'em, they aggravate their misery by
beating 'em unmercifully, and bruising their Fa∣ces
with the pommels of their Swords, till the poor
Wretches driven to despair with all this Op∣pression,
often cry out, <HI>I can hold out no longer; kill
me out-right; put an end to my Miseries by a speedy
Death.</HI> And many deep sighs accompany these
Expressions, which sometimes they are scarce able
to utter, their Strength is so exhausted with their
Toil, their Weariness, and the unmerciful Blows
which they give 'em, without any regard to their
other Miseries.</P>

Spoil from the Coast of <HI>Paria</HI> quite to the
Gulf of <HI>Venecuela,</HI> which is the space of above
200 Leagues; and after having committed their
wonted Robberies, have taken as many <HI>Indians</HI> as
they could, and either sold 'em, or made Slaves of
'em themselves, contrary to the promises often made
'em, that they would treat 'em as their Friends,
and as a free People; which Protestations they ne∣ver
took care to observe. And tho these poor People
did 'em all the good Offices they could, and were
very ready to serve 'em on all occasions; tho they
liberally gave 'em all they had to subsist on them∣selves;
yet 'tis not to be express'd with what Inju∣ries
and Mischiefs the <HI>Spaniards</HI> requited all this kind∣ness.
I purposely omit a great many Disorders which
they committed along this Coast, being willing to
insist only on those matters that are most remarka∣ble.</P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Trinidado</HI> is larger and more fruitful
than that of <HI>Sicily,</HI> it is join'd to the Continent on
that side where it touches <HI>Paria;</HI> the Inhabitants
are a very honest sort of People, teachable enough,
and well inclin'd to Virtue. A Spanish Captain, ac∣companied
with 60 Cut-throats like himself, invad∣ed
this Country in the year 1510, and immediate∣ly
commanded the <HI>Indians</HI> to come to him, pretend∣ing
he was come to live peaceably with them in
the Island; who receiv'd him and his Company
with as great Testimonies of kindness, as if they
had been their own Children. The chief men of
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>
the Country as well as the common People all wait∣ed
on 'em with abundance of alacrity and joy; they
every day brought 'em a quantity of Provisions suffi∣cient
for a much greater number of men: For the
<HI>Indians</HI> are very much given to hospitality, and rea∣dily
supply Strangers with all the Necessaries they
have. In a little time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would needs
make 'em build a vast house, that all the <HI>Indians</HI>
might lodg together in the same place; they us'd
this Artifice to catch 'em in the snare they were
preparing for 'em. When the work was carried
up about the height of two men, they inclos'd a
great many <HI>Indians</HI> within, that the work might be
the sooner finish'd, as they pretended; but the de∣sign
was to hinder any Communication between
them that were within and those that were with∣out:
part of the Souldiers kept the doors of the
house with their Weapons in their hands to prevent
any from going out; another part went in among
'em with their naked Swords, threatning to cut
their Throats, if they made any stir or disturbance;
and so bound 'em all like so many Sheep. If any
one attempted to make his escape, they immediately
cut him in pieces; however divers of 'em escaped,
some whole and others wounded, who joining with
those that had not yet been shut up in this fatal
House, and arming themselves with Bows and Ar∣rows
to the number of 200, retir'd into another
House, where they thought themselves secure, if
they could defend the door against the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
but these set it on fire on the other side, and cruel∣ly
destroy'd these poor Creatures. After this bar∣barous
Expedition they retreated into the Island of
St. <HI>John</HI> with about 180 Prisoners, who had suffer'd
themselves to be bound; where they sold half of 'em,
and the rest in <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> When I severely reprov'd
this Captain for his perfidiousness and cruelty, he

<PB N="65" REF="42"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="66" REF="43"/>
satisfied himself with making me this answer: <HI>Don't
you trouble your self about these matters; they that sent
me gave me Orders to act after this manner, and to
take all those by force that I could not bring away under
the shadow and pretence of Peace.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were
guilty of a world of such base Actions, in seizing
these <HI>Indians</HI> contrary to their promises that they
would treat 'em like Friends.</P>
<P>Let any one now make reflection on the Conduct
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and see if they have any appea∣rance
of right to reduce the Inhabitants of <HI>America,</HI>
as they do, to such a miserable state of bondage. It
was resolv'd among the Dominican Friers to send
some of their Order, to display the Light of the
Gospel among the <HI>Indians</HI> that liv'd in the gross dark∣ness
of Idolatry, and were out of the way of Sal∣vation:
They first sent one that was a Licentiate in
Divinity, of great reputation for his Piety and Vir∣tue,
who took with him a Lay-brother: they both
went through this Country to seek a commodious
place for the building of a Monastry; and conferr'd
with some of the Inhabitants what measures to take
to succeed in this design. When the other Friers were
arriv'd, the <HI>Indians</HI> receiv'd 'em as if they had been
Messengers sent from Heaven; they manifested abun∣dance
of affection to 'em, heard what they said
with great attention, as far as they were capable of
understanding them; for these religious Persons
not being yet sufficiently acquainted with their
Language, were constrain'd to make use of signs to
express their meaning.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Ship that brought the Friers
gone off, but there came another full of Souldiers,
who made use of Treachery and Artifice, according
to their wicked Custom, to seize the Prince of this Na∣tion,
unknown to the Friers. This Prince's name was
<HI>Alfonso,</HI> which was given him either by the Friers, or
<PB N="67" REF="43"/>
some other <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for these <HI>Indians</HI> take upon 'em
Christian Names with a great deal of Joy; and before
they are instructed in our Mysteries, very eagerly de∣sire
to be baptized. This Prince <HI>Alfonso,</HI> together with
his Princess, not aware of the Artifices of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and the deceitful trick they had resolv'd to play 'em,
were perswaded to go on board one of their Ships,
and many other <HI>Indians</HI> did the like, being all made
to believe there was a great Feast prepar'd for 'em;
and they needed the less importunity to entice 'em
into the Ship, because they suppos'd the Friers, in
whom they put abundance of Cofidence, had Inte∣rest
and Authority enough among the Soldiers to se∣cure
'em from all manner of danger: otherwise
they would not have so easily trusted themselves in
the hands of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The very moment they
enter'd the Vessel, these perfidious Men set sail, and
carried 'em to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where they sold 'em for
Slaves. All the Country was alarm'd at the sad
tidings that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had carried away their
Prince and Princess; and came in Crowds to seek
the Friers, who narrowly escap'd being kill'd by 'em.
These good men were extreamly griev'd at the
treachery us'd with these poor People; and would
rather have died than suffer'd these Outrages to
be on all occasions committed against 'em, if they
could have prevented 'em, because these were the
great obstacles that hinder'd 'em from embracing the
Catholick Religion. However, the <HI>Indians</HI> were ap∣peas'd
by the promises the Friers made 'em, that
they would write by the first Vessel that should
go to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> to procure their Prince and Prin∣cess
to be sent back. Accordingly a Vessel being
in a little time prepar'd for this Voyage, they
made use of the opportunity to write to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI>
to engage these Robbers to restore their Prey, which
they obstinately refus'd to do, the Governours of
<PB N="68" REF="44"/>
that Island having had a share in the Booty. These
good Friers who had given their word to the <HI>Indians,</HI>
that their Prince <HI>Alfonso</HI> and his Princess should be
restor'd to em in four months, seeing twice four
Months elaps'd without any hope of their return,
were oblig'd to prepare for death; there was now
no way to avoid shedding their blood for the Glory
of Christ, and in his Service, which Sacrifice they
had offer'd in the ready disposition of their Minds
to suffer before they came from <HI>Spain:</HI> In short,
they were massacred by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who believed
they were Accomplices of the foremention'd Trea∣chery;
and thought their suspicion well founded,
because the Friers had promis'd to redress their
Grievance in four months time; and yet they saw
these promises produc'd no effect: Besides, these
Barbarians make no great difference between those
religious Men that go to the <HI>Indies</HI> only to instruct
and preach to 'em, and the Spanish Souldiers who
go thither only to enrich themselves by robbing 'em.
However, these good Fathers were unjustly put to
death; and one may without scruple place 'em in
the Order of Martyrs, and conclude they are now
enjoying God in the glory of Heaven. They obe∣diently
resign'd themselves to go into <HI>America</HI> ac∣cording
to the direction of their Superiours, and
had no other intention in their Voyage, but that of
preaching the Christian Faith to these Idolaters,
and of putting 'em in the way of Salvation, with a
resolution to suffer any hardships, or even death it
self, in the prosecution of so pious a Design.</P>
<P>The cruel Treatment the <HI>Indians</HI> met with from
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> occasioned 'em likewise to kill two
Dominican Friers about the same time. There was
in these Provinces, near the Gulf of <HI>Codera,</HI> a City,
the Prince of which was nam'd <HI>Higuerote;</HI> who was
naturally of a sweet and amicable temper, and his
<PB N="69" REF="44"/>
Subjects civil and complaisant: when the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
came first ashore in his Country, the Inhabitants treat∣ed
'em with abundance of Kindness; they supplied
'em with Provisions and Stores in great plenty;
and omitted nothing they were capable of doing
to refresh and recruit 'em after the fatigues and
troubles of their Voyage. This Prince had sav'd
the lives of a great many <HI>Europeans,</HI> who had ex∣ercis'd
their Cruelty and Oppression in other Pro∣vinces,
when they came to his Coasts half dead with
hunger and weariness; and after he had recruited
'em with his good Entertainment, sent 'em safe and
in a good state of health to the Isle of <HI>Pearls,</HI> which
was the ordinary Residence of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho
he might have securely kill'd 'em all, without being
ever suspected of the fact. Upon this the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
were so well perswaded of <HI>Higuerote</HI>'s good inclina∣tion
toward 'em, that they took his house for their
home, and were as kindly entertain'd in it as they
could expect to be in their own. While this Coun∣try
thus enjoy'd a profound Peace, a Spanish Captain
coming ashore there, invited divers of the Inhabitants
to come on board his Vessel; which they often did,
from the entire confidence they had in the repeated
Promises the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made 'em that they would
do 'em no injury: At length when many of 'em
were got into the Ship, the Captain gave a Sig∣nal
to put out to Sea, and sail'd directly for the Isle
of <HI>St. John,</HI> where he sold all the poor Creatures,
whom he had thus perfidiously surpriz'd. I soon
after arriv'd in the same Island, where I saw this
Robber, and had a particular account given me of
the Circumstances of this villanous Action; and it
seems, to compleat the Crime, he utterly destroy'd
this Prince's City. These things were not well re∣sented
by the rest of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that us'd to cruise
up and down the neighbouring Coasts to pillage 'em;
<PB N="70" REF="45"/>
for they could not but abhor the Action of this Cap∣tain,
that he should by so infamous a piece of Trea∣chery
abuse this Indian Chief, who had done 'em so
many good Offices from time to time, and was wont
to entertain 'em as if they had been his own Chil∣dren.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> took away above two Millions of
Men from the Coasts of these Provinces, and trans∣ported
'em into the Islands of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> and <HI>St. John,</HI>
where the greatest part perish'd in the Mines, or
by other Hardships which they made 'em suffer. It
would produce Compassion in the hardest Hearts,
to see these Coasts that were once so full of People
now absolutely desert. It has been observ'd by ma∣ny
Trials, that one third part of the Slaves which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take on board their Vessels die by the
way, besides those they kill when they search their
Houses to take these poor Wretches away. The
end the <HI>Spaniards</HI> propose to themselves, which is
to get Riches at any rate in the world, induces 'em
to commit all this Violence; they carry away great
numbers of Slaves, to produce considerable Sums of
Mony, and yet take but a small quantity of Provi∣sions
in their Ships to maintain all these People, for
fear of being at too great a charge in transporting
'em; nay sometimes they have scarce enough for the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that man the Ship: so that many of the
<HI>Indians</HI> perish miserably with Hunger and Thirst;
and sometimes they cast the greatest part of 'em
over board, to preserve the rest. A certain Pilot
told me, that in a Voyage he once made from
the <HI>Lucay</HI> Islands to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> which is about se∣venty
Leagues, he had no need either of a Com∣pass,
or the observation of the Stars to guide his
Vessel; for he assur'd me the floating Bodies of
the <HI>Indians</HI> that had been thrown into the Sea,
serv'd for his Guide throughout this Passage, and
<PB N="71" REF="45"/>
conducted him straight to the port to which he
was bound.</P>
<P>To see the <HI>Indians</HI> arrive in any Island where they
design to sell 'em, can't but excite Compassion and
Trouble in every Mind that is not divested of all
Sentiments of Humanity: To see a great number
of Men. Women and Children stark naked, and so
worn out with Hunger and Hardship, that many of
'em can scarce stand, and others fall down with Faint∣ness;
and to see 'em divided into several Companies
like Sheep, Husbands separated from their Wives,
and Children from their Parents; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
are wont to divide 'em by ten or twenty in a Com∣pany,
and then to cast Lots which share each Man
shall have. This is the trade of these Pirats, who
arm and fit out Vessels on purpose to carry away
these poor Wretches from their own Houses, to in∣rich
themselves by selling 'em for Slaves. When a
<HI>Spaniard</HI> happens to have an old or sick Man fall to
his share among the rest, he'll complain of such a
Lot, and say to his Companions, <HI>Why d'ye give me
this old Fellow that's good for nothing? he is not worth his
keeping: What shall I do with this sick Slave, that will
only be a charge to me, and can do me no Service?</HI> 'Tis
easy to see by all this how little account they make
of these People, and what little regard they have
to the Rules of Christian Charity; 'tis too evident
they neither have any love to God, nor to their
Neighbour, tho on these two (as our Saviour says)
both the Law and the Prophets depend.</P>
<P>The detestable Cruelty and Tyranny of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in insnaring and seizing these poor <HI>Indians,</HI>
when they go in quest of 'em to inslave 'em, and
employ 'em in fishing for Pearls, is scarce to be ima∣gin'd.
The Torments they make these unfortunate
People endure, can scarce be compar'd to any less
than those of Hell. What they suffer in the Gold
<PB N="72" REF="46"/>
Mines, tho very terrible, yet is far inferior to that
we are now relating. They make 'em dive in the
Sea five or six fathom under water (where they are
forc'd to hold their Breath) to take up Mother of
Pearl; and when they come up to the surface of the
Water with Nets full of those Shells, to get a little
Breath, if they keep above water something longer
than ordinary to refresh themselves a little, a mer∣ciless
<HI>Spaniard</HI> who attends with a Boat, beats and
abuses 'em without measure, and often takes 'em by
the hair of the head, to force 'em again under
water, to continue their fishing. They feed 'em
with a little Fish and a piece of dry hungry Bread,
and don't give 'em a Belly full of that neither; they
have no other Bed than the hard ground on which
they make 'em sleep in their Chains, for fear they
should run away. They are often drown'd in fishing
thus for Pearl, or else devour'd by a sort of Sea∣monsters,
that will swallow a Man whole, so that
they hear no more of 'em.</P>
<P>'Tis no hard matter to perceive by what has been
said, that the Precept of Christian Charity is ill ob∣serv'd
in this kind of fishing, seeing these poor
Slaves are expos'd to imminent danger of perishing
both in Soul and Body. The Avarice of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
who mind nothing but Gain, is such, that
they scarce take any care to instruct their Slaves,
and to fortify 'em by communicating the Sacraments
to 'em. They oppress 'em with so much Labour
and Fatigue, that they die in a little time; and 'tis
impossible Men should continue long under water
without Respiration, and endure the great Con∣straint
they suffer in holding their Breath: The
coldness of the Water sometimes makes 'em vomit
Blood; and they soon die, partly by having their
Stomachs so violently press'd by long holding of
their Breath under water, and partly by the ex∣cessive
<PB N="73" REF="46"/>
Cold they endure, which causes that flux of
Blood of which I have just now spoken. Tho they
have naturally black Hair, the Fatigue they undergo
changes the colour of it; so that it becomes like the
Hair of Sea-wolves. The foam of the Sea sticks so
fast to their Shoulders, and in such a manner, that they
look more like Monsters than Men. By this fishing
trade the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have destroy'd all the People of
the <HI>Lucay</HI>-Islands, which were the most skilful and
experienc'd in this Employment; and the reason
why one of those <HI>Indians</HI> was sold for fifty Crowns
or more, and sometimes for a hundred, was be∣cause
they were marvellously dextrous at swimming
and diving. However, those of other Provinces
were employ'd too in this work when they could
take 'em; so that by this means an infinite number
of People have been destroy'd.</P>

<HEAD>Of the River Yuya-pari.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Province is water'd by the River <HI>Yuya-pari,</HI>
tho the source of it is two hundred Leagues
distant. A Spanish Captain once had the boldness
to go up this River to penetrate farther into the
Country, and to ravage and spoil it. He massacred
abundance of People in his way, laid the Coun∣try
waste with Fire and Sword, and ruin'd them
by whole Families, while they were peaceably en∣joying
themselves in their Houses, and thought of
nothing less: But after all this mischief, himself pe∣rish'd
miserably, and his Souldiers quarrel'd and
destroy'd one another. They that afterwards came
into this Country succeeded him in his Cruelties, and
are still laying it waste; they commit abundance of
Massacres and Robberies there with Impunity, and
<PB N="74" REF="47"/>
seem to undertake their long Voyages and Journeys
on purpose to precipitate an infinite number of
Souls into Hell, that were redeem'd by the Blood of
the Son of God.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Kingdom of Vençuela.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1526, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> abus'd by the
Artifices of some ill-designing People, who made
use of a thousand fetches and excuses to conceal
from him the great Devastations the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
made in the new World, to the great prejudice of
the Glory of God, the Christian Religion, and the
Salvation of the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> gave the Government
of the Kingdom of <HI>Vençuela,</HI> which is bigger than
all <HI>Spain,</HI> to several <HI>Flemish</HI> Merchants, with full
Jurisdiction and Power to do what they pleas'd there,
and to dispose of the Country as they thought
convenient. They accordingly enter'd it with
three hundred Men, and found the People there to
be of a meek, tractable and peaceful Disposition, as
indeed the <HI>Indians</HI> generally are when left to their
natural Temper, and not enrag'd by the Abuses so
often offer'd 'em. These were still more brutish
and cruel than those <HI>Spaniards</HI> of whom we have
been hitherto speaking: They exceeded Tygers,
Wolves and Lions in Barbarity, when they saw
themselves Masters of this great Kingdom, in pos∣session
of it, and the Jurisdiction of it entirely put
into their hands: they thought they had ample li∣berty
to do there whatever they pleas'd, and that
they might satisfy their Covetousness at any rate,
and by all the methods they could imagine, tho
never so unjust. They took no care but how to heap
up vast Treasures of Gold and Silver; and the abo∣minable
<PB N="75" REF="47"/>
means they us'd to this end, shew'd they
had no regard either to God or their Prince; nay,
they seem'd to have utterly forgotten that them∣selves
were Men, having put on such an inhuman and
savage Fierceness; or to come yet nearer to their
true Character, they appear'd like so many Devils
in the shape of Men.</P>
<P>They ran through these rich and pleasant Pro∣vinces,
and instantly laid the Country waste for forty
Leagues together, wherein were fruitful Vallies of
a prodigious extent, and Towns and Villages stor'd
with great quantities of Gold. The destruction
they made was so general, that scarce a Man was
left to carry the News of the Cruelties they ex∣ercised
in this Kingdom to other Provinces: none
but those that hid themselves in Caves and Holes of
the Earth, could escape the Sword of these furious
and inhuman Creatures. They invented new kinds
of Punishments wherewith to torment 'em, to force
'em to part with their Gold by discovering the places
where they had hid it: After this manner they
destroy'd three or four Millions of People. The
Instances of three or four Facts will sufficiently dis∣cover
how these Brutes behav'd themselves in this
Kingdom.</P>
<P>One of the first things they did, was to seize him,
whom they look'd upon as the Soveraign Prince of
the whole Kingdom; they loaded him with Irons
to get the more Gold out of him: they endeavour'd
by the Tortures to which they put him, to make
him discover the places where he had secur'd his
Treasures; but he had the good fortune to escape
their hands, and fly into the Mountains: His Sub∣jects
surrounded him, and hid him in the Woods;
but their number was too great to be long conceal'd:
so that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pursued 'em with Swords in
their hands, and made a dreadful Massacre among
<PB N="76" REF="48"/>
'em; others of them they took alive, and sold for
Slaves.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had took their King Prisoner,
they were receiv'd in all these Provinces with sing∣ing,
dancing, and all the highest demonstrations of
Joy, as if come to bring Peace and Plenty with 'em
into the Country: They frankly and voluntarily
gave 'em immense Sums of Gold and Silver; for
which all the Compensation they had was to be
run through, and cut with Lances and Swords, and
massacred without pity. One day when they came
out to meet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to do 'em the more ho∣nour,
the <HI>Flemish</HI> Commander having order'd a
great number of 'em to assemble together in a cer∣tain
House, cut 'em all in pieces immediately, only
some of the poor Wretches got upon the Beams to
avoid the fury of the Souldiers; upon which this
Commander caus'd the House to be fir'd, and de∣stroy'd
them in the Flames. The whole Country
was soon turn'd into a Desert; for all that escap'd
the Souldiers Rage retir'd into the Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> after this pass'd into a vast Pro∣vince
upon the Confines of that of <HI>St. Martha,</HI>
where they found the Natives following their ordi∣nary
business in profound Peace. All the while they
continued here they liv'd at the charge of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
who serv'd 'em with as much Affection and
Diligence, as if they had ow'd their Lives to 'em:
nay, they bore with their troublesom Humors, and
continually receiv'd ill Treatment from 'em with in∣credible
Patience. The <HI>Indians</HI> moreover to qualify
their ill Temper, brought 'em a prodigious quanti∣ty
of Gold, and many other things of great value.
Yet these Tyrants, when upon the point of leaving
'em, instead of gratefully acknowledging all the
good Offices they had receiv'd of 'em, resolv'd to
put 'em all to the Sword. The <HI>Flemish</HI> General
<PB N="77" REF="48"/>
(who has since been suppos'd to be a Heretick, be∣cause
he never went to Mass himself, nor suffer'd
others to go) commanded his Men to take all the
<HI>Indians</HI> with their Wives and Children, and put 'em
into some very large place capable of containing
'em all; and then to declare to 'em that if they had
a mind to redeem their Liberty, with that of their
Wives and Children, they must necessarily lay down
a certain Sum, which this unjust Governor had tax'd
'em according to his own capricious Humour; and
to urge 'em the more to answer his Requirement, he
barbarously prohibited his Men to give any Victuals
to these poor Creatures, till each of 'em had paid
the Sum impos'd on him. Many of 'em sent to their
Houses for the Sum demanded, being willing to do
what they could to redeem their Liberty, and to
have leave to go seek something to eat: Yet they
were no sooner got out of the Clutches of this co∣vetous
Governor, but he instantly sent Soldiers to
take 'em again, and subject 'em to the same Confine∣ment
from which they had ransom'd themselves
with so much difficulty: so that they dy'd in this
Captivity with Hunger and Thirst, unless they spee∣dily
bought their Liberty again, which they forc'd
'em to do by this barbarous usage. So that many
of 'em were taken and retaken thus three or four
times, and every time oblig'd to ransom themselves
with great Sums. Those that were not able to pay
the Tax laid upon 'em, continued in this cruel Prison
till they pin'd away with Hunger and Misery. Thus
was this opulent Province that abounded with Gold,
made desolate in a very little time. There was one
pleasant and fertile Vale ravag'd by these Brutes,
which extended no less than forty Leagues; they
burnt a Town in it consisting of a thousand Houses.
After this resolving to advance farther into the
Country to discover a new way to <HI>Peru,</HI> they made
<PB N="78" REF="49"/>
use of a multitude of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Journey, whom
they loaded with Chains, and their Baggage toge∣ther:
those that fainted under their Burdens with
weariness, they kill'd upon the spot, cutting of
their heads; and divided the Burdens of them that
died among the Survivors.</P>
<P>If one could exactly describe all the Ravage and
Massacres the <HI>Spaniards</HI> commited in this Province,
together with all the Towns they fir'd, so deplora∣ble
a Story would fill every Reader with horror, and
almost surpass belief. Many other Tyrants came
afterward into this Province, who follow'd the steps
of the former in searching for Gold and other Trea∣sure;
but they found the Country so burnt, pillag'd
and desolate, tho it had heretofore been both very
populous and fertile, that they themselves could
not but stand amaz'd to think what Cruelties the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> had endur'd.</P>
<P>All these Violences were plainly prov'd by the
Procurator of the Treasury of the Council of the
<HI>West-Indies.</HI> The Acts and Proceedings made in
this Affair are yet preserv'd upon record; yet not
one of these Tyrants was ever put to death for
the Injuries offer'd these poor <HI>Indians:</HI> so that all
the Process that was made against 'em prov'd to ve∣ry
little purpose. Those Ministers of Justice that
have been hitherto sent into the <HI>Indies</HI> have regard∣ed
nothing but their Interest; and studied how to
enrich themselves without taking the trouble to
examin and punish the Crimes of these Tyrants,
who did so much mischief, and committed so many
Outrages on the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> They content them∣selves
to say in general, that such and such have
committed great Crimes, and abus'd the Inhabitants of
the New World; that they have lessen'd the King's
Revenues to such a degree. But when they have
made these loose and general Enquiries, they go no
<PB N="79" REF="49"/>
farther: Whereas more effectual Remedies ought
to be used to stop the Course of all these Mischiefs.
There is not so much care taken as to evidence and
verify these matters; nor do they give their Acts
and Proceedings all the Life and Authority they
ought: for to discharge their Duty faithfully to
God and the King, they should make such Tyrants
as these restore all the Plunder they have so unjustly
got. And 'twould be no difficult matter to prove
that they carried out of this Kingdom of <HI>Vencuela</HI>
above 3 Millions of Gold, having utterly ruined
the Country for 40 leagues together in the space of
17 years; for so long they continued spoiling this
noble and fruitful Region. They have cheated
the King of above 2 Millions of his Revenues; nor
can they ever be able to repair the damage they
have done this delicious Country, unless the ma∣ny
thousand People they have cruelly murder'd
could be rais'd again from the dead. What I am
now speaking of, only respects the King's tem∣poral
Interest, which they have so ill manag'd, with∣out
saying any thing of their Blasphemies, their
Impieties and Outrages committed immediately a∣gainst
the Divine Majesty. And who shall make
reparation for the loss of so many Souls they have
precipitated into Hell, in not suffering the Missio∣naries
to instruct 'em? These are the Fruits of
their detestable avarice and profanity. As soon as
ever they enter'd this Kingdom, they several times
loaded divers Ships with great numbers of <HI>Indians,</HI>
whom they carried into the Isle of <HI>St. Martha,</HI> and
sold for Slaves. Great multitudes of these poor
Creatures were likewise carried into <HI>Hispaniola,
Jamaica,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>St. John,</HI> to the number at
least of a million of Men. The Royal Council has
been sufficiently inform'd of all these Disorders and
Cruelties; but they are pleas'd to connive at 'em,
<PB N="80" REF="50"/>
and are as willing to shut their Eyes, and take no
notice of all the Robberies and Villanies the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
have committed on the Coasts of the Isle of
<HI>St. Martha;</HI> tho they might have easily hinder'd all
this mischief if they had applied themselves to it.
'Twas the infamous Avarice of these Tyrants, that
induc'd 'em to take so many <HI>Indians</HI> to sell 'em for
Slaves: and the very same covetous humour and
phrenzie has seiz'd all the Europeans that have hi∣therto
set foot in <HI>America.</HI> Their Custom has been
to take the poor <HI>Indians</HI> out of their houses, with
their Wives and Children, to load 'em with Chains,
to mark 'em like Sheep that they might distinguish
'em one from another, and afterwards to sell 'em as if
they had been born Slaves.</P>

<HEAD>Of those Provinces of the Continent called
Florida.</HEAD>
<P>THREE merciless Tyrants have invaded these
Provinces one after another since the year
1510, all animated with the same Spirit, and mov'd
by the same designs. They all committed the same
Outrages throughout this Country, to put them∣selves
by robbing and pillaging into a capacity of
buying places of honour and profit, far above their
quality: but God was pleas'd to punish 'em after a
very signal manner; for they all came to a misera∣ble
end; they were buried in the ruins of those
Houses, which they had built with the Spoils of
so many miserable People whom they had ruin'd
and murder'd. Thus were these Provinces left de∣solate.
These Brutes would doubtless have com∣mitted
yet more Villanies, had not the just Judg∣ment
of the Almighty shorten'd their days, and pu∣nish'd
<PB N="81" REF="50"/>
'em in this Country for the Massacres and
Robberies they had committed in other parts of
the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>When they came into <HI>Florida,</HI> they found it plen∣tifully
stor'd with People, who were wise and well
disciplin'd both in Civil Affairs, and in Morals:
they immediately began to cast a Terror through∣out
the Country by I know not how many Massa∣cres;
so that the poor <HI>Indians</HI> who had never
known any thing like it, were put into a mighty
Consternation. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> us'd 'em instead of
Beasts of burden to carry their Arms, Utensils and
Provisions: yet the Inhabitants of one great Town
express'd abundance of Joy at their arrival, enter∣tain'd
'em with the best they had, and furnish'd 'em
with plenty of Provisions as long as they continued
there; they offer'd 'em 600 of their strongest men
to carry their Baggage, and look to their Horses.
Yet the Spanish General was so little touch'd with
the courtesie of these People, that he kill'd their
Prince with a Lance, that so he might be in a better
condition to pillage them, who little thought of
such a bloody fact as this, and other Cruelties with
which their barbarous Guests requited their kind∣nesses.
They with their Swords and Lances kill'd
all the Inhabitants of another Town, who stood
upon their Guard, and endeavour'd to defend
themselves from the Hostilities of these Tyrants.
They put Men and Women, great and small, Mas∣ters
and Servants all to the Sword, without any
respect either to Age, Sex or Quality. In another
Village a Spanish Captain kill'd above 200 <HI>Indians:</HI>
he cut off the Lips and Noses of others, and sent
'em away in this condition to terrify the rest of the
Country by so horrible a sight. These Cruelties
hinder'd the success of the Missions of our Aposto∣lick
Men in the <HI>Indies,</HI> who had no good reasons to
<PB N="82" REF="51"/>
produce to these poor Wretches to excuse such
Barbarities as these. One may easily guess by this
Instance what love the <HI>Indians</HI> must have for the Ca∣tholicks,
and what confidence they can put in their
Promises. What Idea can they have of God, when
he is described to 'em as infinitly good and merciful?
What can they think of his Law, which they are
told is so holy and just; when they see those that
profess to observe it, not scruple to commit all these
Crimes?</P>
<P>Most of these cruel Villains perish'd miserably
without the least contrition or repentance; and tho
God is infinitely gracious and merciful, there is
reason enough to fear they are condemn'd to eter∣nal
Torments.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the River de la Plata, or Silver-River.</HEAD>
<P>SEveral Spanish Captains have undertaken Voyages
to the <HI>Silver-River,</HI> since the year 1502. The
Country upon it is of a vast extent, and contains ma∣ny
great Kingdoms and noble Provinces. The In∣habitants
are a very rational and civil sort of Peo∣ple,
and live at a considerable distance from the
other <HI>Indians;</HI> which render'd it an easy matter
to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to molest 'em with impunity, and
to exercise all their wonted Rapine and Cruelty
among 'em. They every where carry with 'em the
same design of enriching and making themselves
great and powerful at the cost of these unhappy
People, whom they plunder of their Treasure, as if
it were the spoil of a just and lawful War. Wher∣ever
they come, they use the same ways and means
to compass their design; they torment and kill the
People, pillage and destroy the Country, ruining
whole Nations to possess themselves of their Gold
and Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="51"/>
On the Banks of the <HI>Silver-River</HI> they have de∣stroy'd
divers great Provinces and Kingdoms; and
cut the Throats of multitude of <HI>Indians,</HI> treating
'em with all the Cruelties they could invent: for
when they were at this vast distance from <HI>Spain,</HI>
they did not much fear the King's Authority; be∣lieving
the remoteness of the place where they com∣mitted
their Crimes, would secure 'em from the
danger of suffering for 'em. This hope of impu∣nity
made 'em more barbarously cruel in this Coun∣try
than in others; so that they liv'd here after the
most licentious manner imaginable, without the
least regard to Law or Justice. However some of
their Actions have been reported to the Council of
the <HI>Indies.</HI> A certain Governor one day command∣ed
his Souldiers to enter into a Town, and massa∣cre
all the Inhabitants, if they should refuse to
give 'em what provisions they wanted. The Sol∣diers
prompted by this Order, and supported by
the Authority of the Governor that sent 'em, kill'd
5000 of these poor Creatures; who looking on
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as their declared Enemies, were not
willing to trust 'em, or to have any commerce
with 'em; and therefore hid themselves, not so
much to avoid giving 'em what they as'kd, as to
escape the points of their Swords. The other <HI>In∣dians</HI>
were so terrified by this slaughter, that they
readily offer'd themselves in great numbers to serve
the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> These <HI>Indians</HI> when they were one
day call'd by the Governour to receive some orders
from him, I know not by what hap, made some de∣lay
to present themselves before him; upon which
he commanded 'em to be deliver'd up to another
Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> who were their mortal Enemies.
The poor Wretches as soon as they heard this cruel
Sentence, cried out most hideously, entreating the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> with tears in their Eyes rather to kill 'em
<PB N="84" REF="52"/>
outright with their Swords and Lances, than to
abandon 'em to the rage of their sworn Enemies.
Nor could they by any means be got out of the
house were they were; upon which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
hew'd 'em in pieces one after another; while the poor
<HI>Indians</HI> complain'd to 'em of their barbarity, expres∣sing
themselves with hearts full of anguish and despair
after this manner: <HI>We came voluntarily to meet you,
to offer our Service to you, and to shew you all the re∣spect
we could; and all the return you make to our kind∣ness
is to murder us without pity. Our Blood that is
dash'd on every side upon the Walls of this House shall be
an everlasting witness of your cruelty, and cry for ven∣geance
against you for the unjust death you make us suffer.</HI>
'Tis impossible to reflect on this Action without be∣ing
mov'd both with horror and compassion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the great Kingdoms and Provinces of Peru.</HEAD>
<P>A Spanish Commander with a great number of
Soldiers enter'd these Kingdoms with the Ti∣tle
of Governour; and with a Resolution to heap
up a vast Treasure in a little time. He had already
given some proofs of his skill and capacity on the
Continent; and he every day perfected himself
more and more in the Art of cutting of throats
and pillaging. He was naturally cruel, without
Faith, Honour or Religion; he knew no other
God than Gold or Silver, and therefore gave him∣self
liberty to commit all sorts of Crimes, to get these
Metals any way in the world. He did abundance
of mischief in the large Provinces of <HI>Peru.</HI> 'Tis
not possible to represent to the life what Persecuti∣ons
the Inhabitants of this rich Country underwent;
and what cruel sorts of death they were made to
<PB N="85" REF="52"/>
suffer, to extort their Gold and Silver from 'em.</P>
<P>When this Governour first enter'd <HI>Peru,</HI> he rifled
divers Villages, and took away prodigious quantities
of Gold. He then pass'd into an Island (not far
from this Kingdom) which is very pleasant, fruit∣ful
and populous. The Prince of this Island, toge∣ther
with the Inhabitants, came out to meet the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
and received 'em with great joy and civility.
But in the space of six months, which time the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
continued here, they consum'd all the Corn and
other Provisions they found in the Island. After this
they discover'd that the <HI>Indians</HI> had hid some Corn
under ground, to keep against a time of scarcity, for
the subsistence of their Wives and Children; which
they were constrain'd to leave to the discretion of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> who took possession of it as their own Pro∣perty;
and hereby reduc'd these poor People to the
utmost necessity. Soon after this they left the Island,
but first kill'd a great many of the People, and car∣ried
away the rest with 'em for Slaves. Thus by the
many Cruelties they committed, this Island is quite
depopulated.</P>
<P>From hence they went into the Isle of <HI>Tumbala,</HI>
which is situate near the Continent; here they mas∣sacred
all the Inhabitants that fell into their hands.
The rest frighted at this cruel slaughter, fled every
way they could to avoid 'em; and tho they did this
only to save their Lives, it was interpreted a Rebel∣lion
against the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but was only an Ar∣tifice
of this Tyrant to entrap these miserable Peo∣ple,
that he might make 'em surrender to him all
the Gold and Silver they had: which they brought
to him in great quantities, while he still demanded
greater, being resolv'd to leave 'em nothing: And
when he had strip'd 'em of all they had, he told
them he receiv'd 'em into the number of the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects, and pretended a great deal of kind∣ness
<PB N="86" REF="53"/>
to 'em, promising he would treat 'em as his
friends, and not do 'em the least hurt for the time
to come. This Hypocrite was for plundering the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and terrifying 'em with menaces of the
King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s displeasure; but had the Policy not
to receive 'em into the number of this Prince's Vas∣sals,
till he had robb'd 'em of all they had. And
yet the Title of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects did
not secure 'em for the future from his Insults and
Robberies.</P>
<P>The name of the Soveraign Prince and Empe∣ror
of all these Kingdoms was <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> who
brought with him an innumerable Army of naked
men, who made use of a ridiculous sort of Wea∣pons,
not understanding the force of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
Swords and Lances, and Horses, with which these
<HI>Indians</HI> had never been acquainted; he advanc'd his
Troops near the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> crying with a great deal
of courage, <HI>Where are these</HI> Spaniards? <HI>I'll never leave
'em till they have made me satisfaction for all my Subjects
that have been kill'd by them; of all my Towns which
they have burnt, and of all my Riches which they have
carried away.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> came to meet this
Prince in good order and well-arm'd, and made a
horrible slaughter among his Souldiers; they took
the King himself, who was carried on a stately Seat
upon the Shoulders of his Subjects. This Prince
finding himself in this miserable Condition, began
to treat with 'em about his Ransom, for which
he promised to give 'em 4 Millions of Crowns: for
this Sum they engag'd to give him his Liberty; yet
would not stand to their own Agreement, but
obliged him to assemble all his People, who to obey
their Prince's order came together in Crowds. This
King bore such a sway in the minds of his Subjects,
that he boasted that the Leaves of the Trees in the
Woods durst not move without his order. He told
<PB N="87" REF="53"/>
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he was their Prisoner, and they had
now power to put him to death if they pleas'd.
Upon this they held a Council of War to deliberate
what to do with him; and resolv'd to burn him
with a gentle Fire: only there was one Captain not
quite so inhuman as the rest, who told 'em they
ought to content themselves with strangling him,
and then burning him after he was dead. When
the King was inform'd that he was condemn'd to
die, he thus express'd himself; <HI>Why will ye needs put
me to death? What Crime have I committed against
you? Did you not promise to restore me my Liberty, pro∣vided
I would pay that Fine of Gold you impos'd on me?
Have not I given you a greater Sum than you demanded?
However if you are resolv'd to kill me first send me at
least to the King of</HI> Spain. But all his Complaints,
all his just Reproaches and Protestations could not
hinder them from burning him. 'Tis easy to see
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had no right to make War with
this Prince and to treat him so inhumanly. But
the Captivity of this King, the Sentence of Death
pronounc'd against him, and the Cruelty with which
they put it in execution, after they had extorted
such vast Treasures from him, all sufficiently disco∣ver
the Genius of these Tyrants, and of what In∣justice
and Violence they have been guilty both
against the Princes and People of the new World.</P>
<P>I have a Letter from a Monk of the Order of
St. <HI>Francis</HI> written to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by which
it will appear how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> behav'd themselves
towards the <HI>Indians:</HI> The very Terms of which
Letter I'll here set down.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I, Frier <HI>Mark de Xlicia</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI>
General of all the Monks of the said Order in <HI>Peru,</HI> who
came into this Country with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that first in∣vaded
it, do testify what I have seen with my own Eyes of
<PB N="88" REF="54"/>
the manner of their treating the People of this new World.
Having been an Eye-witness, I have a certain knowledg
of the Disposition and Manners of the Inhabitants of <HI>Pe∣ru;</HI>
they are a meek, good-humour'd and peaceable Na∣tion,
and have shewn a great deal of Affection and Re∣spect
to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> I have seen 'em give 'em great
Sums of Gold and Silver, and Pearls of a great value
very readily; they render'd 'em all the Services they could
require of 'em with all the diligence that could be reasonably
desir'd. They never offer'd to make War with 'em, nor
so much as to put themselves in a posture of Defence, till
they had receiv'd all imaginable Injuries from 'em, and
were thereby constrained to it contrary to their Inclina∣tions.
They gave the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as many Men and
Women as they needed for their Domestick Business;
and when they had receiv'd 'em into their Towns and
Villages with all the Honours they could think of, they
supplied 'em liberally with all the necessary Accommoda∣tions
of Life.</P>
<P>I farther testify, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> without having
receiv'd the least occasion of Offence from the <HI>Indians,</HI>
seiz'd their great <HI>Cacique Atabalipa,</HI> soon after they
enter'd his Country, and burnt him after they had receiv'd
four Millions of Gold of him, and after having taken
immense Sums out of his Province without any Resistance.
They inflicted the same Punishment on <HI>Cochilimaca</HI> his
Captain General, when he came to meet them in an ami∣cable
manner with many other Noblemen of <HI>Peru.</HI> A
few days after another great Lord of the Province of
<HI>Quitonia</HI> suffer'd the same fate; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> burnt
him without having the least occasion given 'em for so
cruel an Action: With the like Barbarity and Injustice
they burnt <HI>Schapera</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Canaries.</HI> They
also burnt the feet of <HI>Aluis,</HI> the first and greatest Lord
of the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> and put him to a great
many other Torments to make him reveal K. <HI>Atabalipa</HI>'s
Treasures, of which he was utterly ignorant, as it evi∣dently
<PB N="89" REF="54"/>
appear'd by the sequel. They condemn'd <HI>Coco∣pagaganga</HI>
to the same Punishment, who was Prince of
the Province of <HI>Quitonia:</HI> He suffer'd himself to be
over perswaded by the Treaties of <HI>Sebastian Banalcaçar</HI>
a Spanish Captain, to come in an amicable manner and
surrender himself to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> this Captain having
given him his word that no Injury should be done him; yet,
contrary to this promise, he was burnt alive, with several
<HI>Caciques</HI> besides: and I have been inform'd, that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> design'd to shew no Mercy to any <HI>Indian</HI> in
the Country.</P>
<P>I moreover affirm, that I my self have seen the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in several places cut off the Noses, Ears and
Hands of Indian Men and Women, without any Provo∣cation,
in cold Blood (as it seem'd) purely for the sake of
doing Mischief, which is a most inexcusable sort of Bar∣barity.
I have seen the <HI>Spaniards</HI> set their fierce and
hungry Dogs at the <HI>Indians</HI> to tear 'em in pieces and de∣vour
'em. And I have seen 'em set fire to so many
Towns and Villages, that 'tis impossible I should recollect
the number of 'em. 'Tis certain they have torn Children
from their Mothers Breasts, and thrown 'em with all their
might as far as they could, to divert themselves with this
brutish Sport. I have often been a Witness of many other
Cruelties of this nature, which have fill'd me with Dread
and Horror; but I should be too prolix and tedious to give
the Detail of 'em.</P>
<P>I protest, that once the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they had as∣sembled
the greatest number of <HI>Indians</HI> they could in three
great Houses, set fire to 'em and burnt 'em all alive,
without any reason, having not receiv'd the least affront
from 'em. And a certain Priest, whose name was <HI>Ocana,</HI>
happening to attempt to take a young Child out of the
Flames, a <HI>Spaniard</HI> that saw him, took the Child from
him, and immediately cast it again into the Fire, where
it was burnt with the rest. This <HI>Spaniard</HI> the same day
be committed this black and cursed Action, died suddenly
<PB N="90" REF="55"/>
as he was going to the Camp; and I was of opinion that
his Carcase ought not to be interred.</P>
<P>I have seen the <HI>Spaniards</HI> send Deputies to the <HI>Ca∣ciques</HI>
and chief <HI>Indians,</HI> to engage 'em to come and
meet 'em without fear, promising 'em to employ their In∣terest
with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> on their behalf: but as soon
as they were come upon the Credit of the Promises that
had been given 'em, they were burnt without Pity or any
formal Process. Two of the most illustrious and conside∣rable
<HI>Indians</HI> were burnt in my sight, one at <HI>Andonia,</HI> and
the other at <HI>Tumbala.</HI> All the Efforts I made to secure
'em from the Flames, and to get 'em out of the hands of
these bloody Wretches, were to no purpose; my Discourses
and Exhortations made no impression on 'em. I can
say with a good Conscience, and in the presence of God,
that so far as I have been able to learn, by the long time
I have been among 'em, the Inhabitants of <HI>Peru</HI> have
never fomented any Mutiny or Rebellion, or done the least
Injury to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have treated them so inhu∣manly;
but whatever Torments they have suffer'd, they
seem'd to have laid aside the thoughts of Revenge. And
when they found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were always deceiving
'em, and breaking the Promises they made 'em; when they
found they treated 'em with so much Tyranny, contrary to
all Law and Equity; and that they did not scruple to
commit all sorts of Outrages against 'em, they rather
chose to die, than to be continually expos'd to such Mi∣series.</P>
<P>I have been inform'd by the Accounts the <HI>Indians</HI>
themselves have given, that there is a great deal more
Gold among 'em undiscover'd than has been yet found;
the ill Ʋsage and Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having made
'em conceal it: and they are resolv'd never to discover it
while they are treated with so much Injustice and Tyranny,
but will rather die as their Companions have done, who
have been put to death with so much Cruelty. The Injuries
offer'd these poor <HI>Indians</HI> are very hainous Sins in the
<PB N="91" REF="55"/>
sight of God, and contrary to the Interest and Service of
the King, who has been cheated of more Treasure in <HI>Peru</HI>
than would keep all the People in <HI>Castile.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus far the Letter of that Monk, which was
confirm'd by the Attestation of the Bishop of <HI>Mexi∣co:</HI>
He was an Eye-witness of what he here relates,
for he went through this Country for the space of
fourscore or a hundred Leagues, and continued there
nine or ten years, in a time when there were but
few <HI>Spaniards</HI> there. But as soon as it was reported
in <HI>Spain</HI> that this new World was so full of Gold,
there presently came four or five thousand People,
who spread themselves through these noble Pro∣vinces,
and possess'd five or six hundred Leagues of
the Country, which they entirely ruined, commit∣ting
all those Disorders and Crimes that have been
mention'd before. They have destroy'd a great ma∣ny
more People here than this Frier takes notice of
in his Letter: and without having any fear of God
before their Eyes, or any regard to the King, or
the least sentiment of Compassion to their fellow-Creatures,
they have almost destroy'd one half of
Mankind; for in the Provinces of <HI>Peru</HI> alone they
have kill'd above forty Millions of People.</P>
<P>A few days after what I have related above, they
kill'd a great Queen with Arrows made of Reeds;
she was Wife to Prince <HI>Elingue,</HI> who still governs
this Province in quality of King: the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did
what they could to seize this Prince's Person, and
omitted no Tricks and Artifices to accomplish it;
this was the occasion of his Revolt against the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
and he has ever since continued their declar'd
Enemy. They took his Queen contrary to the Rules
of Equity and Justice; and 'tis said they kill'd her
at a time when she was big with Child, meerly to vex
and grieve the King her Husband, who lov'd her
<PB N="92" REF="56"/>
very tenderly. If all the Massacres the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have committed in <HI>Peru</HI> should be recounted, every
one would be astonish'd at the recital, and the num∣ber
of 'em after an exact Computation would sur∣pass
all probability, and appear too great to be
believ'd.</P>

<HEAD>Of the new Kingdom of Grenada.</HEAD>
<P>A Great number of <HI>Spaniards</HI> went from <HI>Vene∣çuela,</HI>
the Isle of <HI>St. Martha,</HI> and <HI>Carthagena</HI>
in the year 1536, to make a Discovery of <HI>Peru:</HI> Di∣vers
others went up higher, three hundred Leagues
beyond <HI>St. Martha</HI> and <HI>Carthagena,</HI> to discover
those excellent Countries that were very fertile, and
full of People of a mild and sociable Temper;
where is abundance of Gold and precious Stones
found, especially Emeralds: they gave this King∣dom
the name of <HI>New Grenada,</HI> because the Cap∣tain
that first set his foot in it was born at <HI>Grenada.</HI>
They that accompanied him were very profligate
Men, and extremely cruel; they shed human Blood
without any scruple or remorse, for they had been
long accustom'd to all sorts of Wickedness, and
therefore 'tis the less to be wonder'd at that they
have committed so many Crimes in this <HI>New Grenada,</HI>
where they abandon'd themselves to all manner of
Abominations. I shall only mention some Instances
of 'em, because an exact recital of their Cruelties
would fill the Minds of all that read this History
with too much Horror.</P>
<P>A certain Governor that could not get his share
of the Booty another had got before him in ra∣vaging
this new Kingdom of <HI>Grenada</HI> at his pleasure,
tho he could have seconded him with all his heart
<PB N="93" REF="56"/>
in the Cruelties and Robberies he committed here;
yet being enrag'd to see such a valuable Prey escape
him, thought meet to appease his Trouble after a
sort, and to revenge himself on the other by making
authentick Informations confirm'd by the concur∣rent
Testimony of many Witnesses, which expos'd
to light all the Vexations, Murders and Cruelties
which this Tyrant had been guilty of in <HI>New Gre∣nada.</HI>
The said Informations were read in the Coun∣cil
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they have been hitherto pre∣serv'd,
and are yet to be seen.</P>
<P>In these Informations the Witnesses depose, that
this new Kingdom enjoy'd a settled Peace before the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> came thither; that the People shew'd 'em
all the kindness imaginable as soon as they came a∣mong
'em; that they maintain'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with
their Labour, and the Fruit of the Ground which
they manur'd; that they gave 'em prodigious quan∣tities
of Gold, and abundance of precious Stones,
amongst others a great many Emeralds; that they
freely brought 'em whatever was most valuable in
their Cities, the Government of which the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
divided among themselves when they had can∣ton'd
'em into several parts: for this they counted a
proper method, the better to compass their design
of heaping together all the Gold they could possibly
find.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Indians</HI> were first subjugated to the
Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the chief Captain, who
was General of the rest, took possession of the King's
Person as well as of the Country, and kept him
Prisoner for five or six Months, without any reason
in the World, demanding Gold and Emeralds of
him continually. This King, whose name was <HI>Bogata,</HI>
in the midst of his fears, promis'd the Spanish Ge∣neral
to deliver up all the Gold-plate he had, hoping
by this means to get out of the hands of this Tyrant:
<PB N="94" REF="57"/>
he sent a great many <HI>Indians</HI> to his House to fetch
these precious Goods; and at the several turns they
made he gave the <HI>Spaniard</HI> a great quantity of
Gold and Emeralds; who was not content with all
this, but threaten'd to kill him. Accordingly he
commanded this unfortunate King to be brought be∣fore
him to receive his Sentence. This is the Treat∣ment
these Tyrants give the most illustrious Persons
of the new World: This haughty General pro∣nounc'd
a fatal Sentence against this Prince, by
which he was condemn'd to most horrible Torments
if he did not immediately send for all the Gold he
had: Accordingly this Tyrant's Executioners laid
hold of the King, stretch'd him out at length upon
the ground naked, and pour'd boiling Rosin upon his
Belly; besides this, they put his feet into a Fire, hav∣ing
fasten'd his Neck to a Stake fix'd in the ground,
while two of these Hangmen held him by the Arms.
The cruel General came from time to time to look
upon him while this Torture continued, threatning
to take away his Life if he did not speedily deliver
up his Gold. God seem'd by his Providence to sig∣nify
his Displeasure against these Cruelties, in suf∣fering
the City where they were committed to be
consum'd with Fire in a moment. The rest of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> took pattern by their General, and fill'd
up his steps: And having no other trade than that
of tormenting the <HI>Indians,</HI> and cutting 'em in pieces,
they practised the same Villanies in divers parts of
this Kingdom: They inflicted terrible Punishments
on several <HI>Caciques,</HI> and all their Subjects, who too
imprudently depended on the good words and pro∣mises
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made 'em: And this after they
had given 'em incredible Sums of Gold, and many
Emeralds. These Presents, tho so valuable, could
not soften their obdurate Hearts, and render 'em
civil to their Benefactors▪ The Tortures to which
<PB N="95" REF="57"/>
they put the <HI>Indians</HI> were to make 'em bring yet
more Gold and precious Stones; and the same motive
has induc'd 'em to burn all the great Lords of the
Country with a slow fire. A great multitude of
<HI>Indians</HI> one day came to meet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with a
great deal of humility and simplicity (as their man∣ner
is) to offer 'em their service, supposing them∣selves
safe; but while they were sleeping without any
apprehension of danger, being faint and weary,
a Spanish Captain commanded his men to massacre
'em all, which was accordingly executed. This
was done to strike the whole Country with terror
and consternation, and to fright the Inhabitants
out of their Gold by the horror of so tragical a
Spectacle. The General made his Souldiers swear
how many <HI>Caciques</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> each of 'em had
kill'd, and how many they had reserv'd alive for
their Slaves; these he immediately order'd 'em to
bring out into the most publick place of their City,
and made 'em there cut off the heads of 4 or 500
of these poor Creatures. Divers Witnesses have
depos'd that this Captain order'd the hands and no∣ses
of many <HI>Indians</HI> both Men and Women to be cut
off, and exercis'd other unheard of Cruelties among
'em. He sent into <HI>Bogata</HI>'s Province to enquire who
had succeeded that Prince, whom he had so inhu∣manly
put to death: The Men he sent to make this
Discovery took as many <HI>Indians</HI> as they could; such
of 'em as could not tell the name of their late Prin∣ce's
Successor, were barbarously abus'd, some of 'em
had their Arms and Legs cut off; others were ex∣pos'd
to the fury of greedy Dogs, and soon torn in
pieces by 'em.</P>
<P>They fell upon a great number of Caciques and
Indian Noblemen by a treacherous surprize in the
middle of the Night, after they had assur'd 'em they
need not fear any affront or abuse from them. The
<PB N="96" REF="58"/>
innocent <HI>Indians</HI> confiding in these fair promises,
were come down out of the Mountains where they
had hid themselves, to lodg in the Cities, not sus∣pecting
the ill design the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had against 'em:
However these perfidious men surpriz'd 'em, and
cut off the Hands and Arms of all they took, let∣ting
'em know they were chastiz'd after this severe
manner for not telling the name of their late King's
Successor. Another time the General sent a great par∣ty
of Soldiers into a City to make war with the In∣habitants,
because they sent him not a basket of Gold
which he had demanded: they made these poor
people suffer a thousand Outrages, and massacred vast
numbers of 'em. They inhumanly cut off the no∣ses
and hands both of Men and Women, and gave
others to be devour'd by their Dogs, which were
wont to be fed with human flesh.</P>
<P>The people of one of these Provinces, seeing
5 or 6 of their Chiefs burnt to death with a slow
fire, were frighted by this horrible sight into the
mountains to shelter themselves from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
they were about 5 or 6000: hereupon the Spanish
Commander sent a Company of Soldiers to pursue
'em, and treat 'em as Rebels. 'Tis hard to imagine
by what right they assum'd an Authority to punish
people as rebels, that were free-born, and did not
in the least depend on 'em. When the Spanish
Soldiers were got into this Mountain, they fell on
the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who were naked and disarm'd,
with a fury like that of Wolves and Lions, when they
set upon a flock of Sheep to devour 'em; till at
length they were so spent and fatigu'd meerly with
slaughtering these poor Creatures, that they were
forc'd to give over a while to take breath; after
which they renew'd this Massacre with more vigour.
And to cut short their bloody work, they threw
down the greatest part of these <HI>Indians</HI> headlong
<PB N="97" REF="58"/>
from the top of the Mountain, which was very high.
It has been depos'd by those that were Eye-witnesses
of this Tragedy, that they forc'd above 700 of these
poor <HI>Indians</HI> all together down this Precipice, so
that they look'd like a Cloud as they fell; they were
all dash'd in pieces by this dreadful fall, and died
miserably.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> push'd on this barbarous Expedition
to the utmost; for they made a diligent search in
all the remote Corners of the Mountain, and gave
no quarter to any they found; those they could catch
were either cut to pieces, or after many wounds cast
down from the top of the Mountain. Nor did these
Cruelties satisfy 'em, but they shut up divers <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
both Men and Women, whom they had reserv'd
for Slaves, in a house cover'd with straw, which
they set on fire and so consum'd 'em. They likewise
went to the City of <HI>Cola,</HI> where they took abun∣dance
of People, with about 15 or 20 of their
Great Men; they expos'd these to the fury of their
Dogs, which devour'd 'em, having first cut off the
hands and feet both of Men and Women; and
fix'd these sad Spoils on Poles, that they might be
obvious to the view of all, and that the dreadful
sight might cast terror and amazement in the minds
of all that surviv'd.</P>
<P>The Ravage and Cruelties these bloody-minded
Men exercised in this new Kingdom of <HI>Grenada</HI> are so
great, that if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> dos not apply a spee∣dy
remedy, and set bounds to their excessive Avarice
and insatiable thirst of Gold, that whole Kingdom
will soon be destroy'd, and the Land lie unculti∣vated
and unimprov'd, for want of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the space of 2 or 3 years, since this Kingdom
has been discover'd, they have without the fear of
God or Man put the Inhabitants to death, without
any emotion or pity to see so much human blood
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>
pour'd out. There are now scarce any People to
be found there after all these Massacres. There are
divers fine large Provinces near <HI>New Grenada;</HI> this
Country is called <HI>Popoyan</HI> and <HI>Cali,</HI> and is above
50 leagues in extent, which they also have ruined,
and made as desolate as the former. Here they
have so slaughter'd the people, that this once po∣pulous
Country is now quite destitute of Inhabitants.
Those that come from thence relate such terrible
things of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> proceedings there, that one
can't hear their sad Stories, without being pierc'd
with trouble and compassion in a very sensible man∣ner.
In these Provinces they have ruin'd many fine
Cities from one end to t'other; so that they now
lie buried in their own Ashes: there are scarce any
of the ruins of those Cities to be seen, which once
contain'd above 2000 Houses. In a word, this Coun∣try
which was full of Villages, Towns, and Cities
for the space of 50 leagues, is now so bare, that
there's scarce any token remaining to signifie there
ever were any such buildings.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came from <HI>Peru</HI> into <HI>New
Grenada</HI> and <HI>Popoyan</HI> through the Province of <HI>Qui∣tonia;</HI>
others of 'em came to <HI>Cali</HI> by the way of
<HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Vraba,</HI> but all join'd together to car∣ry
on the same design, spoiling a Country of 600
leagues in extent of all its Riches, and extirpating
all the Inhabitants after they had plunder'd 'em.
When this cruel War was ended, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took
some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom they had reserved for
Slaves, into their service, and caus'd the heads of se∣veral
of their Companions to be cut off in their sight
to terrify 'em; telling 'em they must all expect to
undergo the same fate, if they did not serve 'em
faithfully. By the recital of such barbarous Actions
as these, the Reader may easily imagin how the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
behave themselves towards the <HI>Indians</HI> in the
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
several parts of <HI>America.</HI> They feed their fierce
Dogs with human flesh, on purpose to accustom 'em
to tear Men in pieces, and devour 'em. They car∣ry
these Dogs with 'em wherever they go, and
barbarously murder the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> to feed these
savage Curs with their flesh. They'l say one to ano∣ther,
Give me a quarter of that <HI>Indian</HI> to make my
Dog a feast; and when I kill one, I'll pay you again.
They commonly hunt in the morning with these
Dogs; and when ask'd by their fellows what luck
they have had, they answer according to their success.
Sometimes one will say, I am content, my Dogs have
kill'd about a score of 'em; so that one would think
they were speaking of Wolves or wild Boars. Can
any thing be imagin'd that exceeds such horrible
Cruelty as this? And all these Barbarities have been
prov'd and averred by strict Examinations made and
produc'd before the Council of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="in general">
<P>But I shall add no more, till I shall receive farther
information of their other Villanies, which may be
expected to be yet greater than those I have men∣tion'd,
if greater can possibly be committed. And
that which is most deplorable is, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
take no care to speak to these people of the My∣steries
of our Religion; nor seem to regard 'em
any more than Dogs or wild Beasts. Nay they
have forbidden the Monks and Missionaries to in∣struct
'em, whom they have even persecuted, and
laid a thousand Obstructions in their way, to hin∣der
'em from preaching the Gospel to these poor
Creatures who passionately desired it; and all because
they thought the Conversion of these People would
be an Obstacle to their covetous Designs, and hin∣der
'em from getting all the Gold they desir'd. So
that these miserable people have been industriously
kept in their former ignorance, and know no other
God than those of Wood, Stone or Copper; unless
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>
it be the People of <HI>New Spain</HI> (which is but a small
part of <HI>America)</HI> where the Monks have exercised
their Function, and have been suffer'd to display
their Zeal with more freedom. In the other Pro∣vinces
the <HI>Indians</HI> perish without Baptism, or any
other Sacrament; and no one gives himself the
trouble to instruct 'em; as will farther appear by
an authentick Letter from a Bishop of this Country,
who expresses himself in these Terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Frier <HI>Bartholomew de Las-Casas,</HI> Monk of the
Order of <HI>St. Dominique,</HI> having signified my desire to
be recall'd from the <HI>Indies,</HI> had leave to come over to
the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> to give an account of the deplorable
Condition of the <HI>Indians.</HI> To this I have been mov'd
by the Zeal with which God has inspir'd me for Souls re∣deem'd
by his Blood. My earnest desire is, that they
may know their Creator, and embrace his Word, that
they may be sav'd. And I cannot choose but extremely
pity <HI>Spain,</HI> my native Country, because I am greatly
afraid God will utterly destroy it, for the enormous
Crimes committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (who go into the <HI>In∣dies)</HI>
both against God, against the King, and against
their Neighbours. I don't doubt but divers illustrious
Persons of this Court, who are truly zealous for the Sal∣vation
of Souls, are very sensibly touch'd with the Cala∣mities
and Miseries those multitudes of poor Creatures
suffer in the New World, who are abandon'd to the fury
of the Spanish Souldiers. I resolv'd long ago to draw up
an exact relation of these matters, but have been still
hinder'd by the continual urgency of those affairs in which
I have been engag'd till now. However I have at length
accomplish'd this design at <HI>Valence,</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Decem∣ber,
Anno</HI> 1542. This Treatise gives a short account
of the Violence, Tyranny, Persecutions, Robberies, Mas∣sacres
and Devastations committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in
all the parts of <HI>America</HI> where they have dispers'd them∣selves.
<PB N="101" REF="60"/>
These Calamities and Disorders are advanc'd to
a degree that surpasses all belief, and is the more surpriz∣ing
in that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are much less furious and cruel
every where else. Indeed the People of <HI>Mexico</HI> and of the
places adjacent, are now treated much better than others;
insomuch that no body there dares offer violence to any
<HI>Indian</HI> openly: 'Tis true they exact immense Sums of
'em, but the forms of Justice are at least so observ'd,
that the People are protected from the Insults and Affronts
of such as have more power than themselves. I have
great hope our Illustrious Lord, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Em∣peror
and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who begins to take cognizance
of the Tyranny and ill behaviour of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> toward
the <HI>Indians,</HI> will undertake the protection of these mise∣rable
People, who are persecuted against his will, as well
as against the will of God. All the miseries that have
bin inflicted on these newly discover'd Nations have bin hi∣therto
conceal'd from our Prince with no less subtilty and
address than malice. Yet now 'tis not to be doubted but
this wise Emperor, into whose hands God has cast the Go∣vernment
of those vast Regions, and who bears so sincere
an affection to Justice, will give effectual Orders to put
a stop to these Persecutions. May God preserve this Illu∣strious
Emperor in all the Glory and Prosperity that at∣tends
him, for the Salvation of his Soul, and the Pre∣servation
of the Church. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>A year after the writing of all of these matters
above recited, there were published in the City of
<HI>Madera</HI> certain Laws and Constitutions made by his
Majesty at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> in the month of <HI>December</HI> in the
year 1542. which were calculated according to the
urgent necessity of Affairs to rectify the Disorders
that were then commited with so much Insolence both
against God and Man, to the utter destruction and
desolation of the New World. For the constituting
of these wise Laws his Majesty assembled a great
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>
many Persons, illustrious both for their Quality and
Learning, and moreover endued with great Piety,
who deliberated on these important Affairs in di∣vers
Sessions at <HI>Valladolid.</HI> At length by the unani∣mous
Consent of the whole Assembly, divers Pro∣positions
were ratified and publish'd; and which ap∣pear
the more conformable to the Rules of Christia∣nity,
in as much as the Persons who compos'd this
famous Assembly had never been any way concern'd
in the Outrages offer'd the <HI>Indians;</HI> they were such
as had neither wash'd their hands in their Blood,
nor reap'd any advantage by the immense Treasures
that had been taken from 'em with so much Vio∣lence,
after the murder of incredible numbers
of innocent People. For the Avarice and Cruelty
of those <HI>Spaniards</HI> who first set foot in <HI>America</HI> have
been the fatal Causes of all the Miseries that new
World has undergon.</P>
<P>After the publication of these new Orders for
regulating the Affairs of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Protectors
of those cruel Tyrants, who had still some Credit
at Court, procur'd several Precepts to constitute
Officers to send into divers Provinces of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
for they were much concern'd to see the course of
their Violence likely to be stop'd, and their wonted
Robberies and Extortions obstructed. And thus
they to whom the care of suppressing these Disor∣ders,
and preventing the farther Insults of these
Tyrants was committed, made no conscience of
violating that Equity and Fidelity they ow'd both to
God and their Prince; for they knew very well
what effect the Edicts that were made must needs
have, and therefore alarm'd the People before the
arrival of the Judges who were sent to the <HI>Indies</HI>
to publish the Laws of their Prince, and to put 'em
in execution: so that as soon as these Judges came
into <HI>America,</HI> they appear'd to be of the same stamp
<PB N="103" REF="61"/>
with those that sent 'em, and neither regarded God
nor Man; they immediately forgot the King's Or∣ders,
and laid aside the Reverence due to so great
a Prince; and being willing to take part with those
Tyrants, that they might have a share of the Booty,
behav'd themselves with a Cruelty beyond imagi∣nation,
and justified those Villanies which they were
sent to punish.</P>
<P>So that since the year 1542, such Rapine and
Violence has been committed in <HI>Peru,</HI> that the like
has not been heard of either in the <HI>Indies,</HI> or any
other part of the World: Nor do they exercise
their Cruelty only on the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom they have
almost exterminated, but are suffer'd by the just
Judgment of God to turn their Arms one against
another with great fury to their mutual destruction.
Some of the People of this new World under the
protection of these Rebels, were encourag'd to re∣fuse
Obedience to the Emperor's Orders; others
pretending they were desirous to address Petitions
to his Imperial Majesty, have suffer'd themselves to
be carried down the stream with the rest, and have
revolted too. For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not easily per∣swaded
to surrender those Treasures they have un∣justly
usurped, or to release those <HI>Indians</HI> whom
they have inslav'd. If they don't so often massacre
'em, they increase the weight of their Irons, and im∣pose
Laws on 'em more and more unjust and rigo∣rous.
And the King with all his Authority has not
yet been able to stop the course of these Mischiefs,
because they are generally link'd together in a Con∣federacy,
both small and great; and all use the li∣centious
trade of robbing and spoiling more or less
according to their power, some more publickly,
and others after a clandestine manner. But that
which yet further discovers the Boldness and Inso∣lence
of these Hypocrites is, that they still make
<PB N="104" REF="62"/>
pretences that they consult nothing but the King's
Interest, and the Glory of God in all they do;
while 'tis most apparent, they are continually rob∣bing
the King, and that with impunity, and are
always dishonouring God and Religion by their cri∣minal
and scandalous Practices.</P>
<P>That which next follows is a Fragment of a Let∣ter
of a certain Person who accompanied the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in their Voyages and Journies, giving an ac∣count
of their Actions in the various places through
which they pass'd: But this Letter being design'd to
be sent with other Papers, he that made up the
Packets lost several Pages of it which contain'd very
remarkable and extraordinary things concerning the
Actions of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This Fragment I send you
is the Body of the Letter, the beginning and end of
which are both wanting. However, seeing that
which it contains deserves the notice of the Publick,
I thought meet to print it, and hope the view of it
will produce the same effect of moving you to com∣miserate
the Calamities of the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> as I
presume the more ample Relation I have given you
above has done: And consequently that your won∣ted
Charity will excite in your Minds an ardent de∣sire
to oppose and rectify all those Disorders as much
as in you lies.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>—The Captain order'd these <HI>Indians</HI> to
be chain'd for Slaves, which was presently done,
and he carried away with him great numbers of
Men and Women in Chains; so that the whole
Country was soon turn'd into a Desert. They
took away all the Crop of Corn these poor Crea∣tures
had, and whatever else they had laid up for
the subsistence of their Families, by which means
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>
they were soon reduc'd to extreme want; so that
many were found dead in the High-ways merely
with Famine. There were also above ten thousand
of those <HI>Indians</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took to carry their
Baggage, that died on the Coasts: for almost all
that went any distance from the Sea were kill'd
with the excessive Heat they met with on the Con∣tinent.
This same Captain following the steps of
<HI>John Ampudia,</HI> sent before him two <HI>Indians</HI> whom
he had taken in the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> to disco∣ver
the Villages and Towns that were in their way,
and where any Booty was to be got; these <HI>Indians</HI>
were either his own Slaves, or those of his Soul∣diers,
some of whom had two or three hundred
Slaves a Man, and others more or less, as they had
more or less Baggage and Provisions to carry.
These <HI>Indians</HI> return'd to their Master, together
with such others as they could bring away with 'em.
And in these Expeditions all sorts of Cruelties were
committed upon Women and Children. They did
the same in the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> they fir'd
their Houses wherever they came, and burnt all
the Stores of Corn the <HI>Indians</HI> had. And to shew
their spite the more, as if all this Mischief had
been too little, they kill'd their Cattel only for
the Suet and Marrow, having no occasion for the
Flesh; only the <HI>Indians</HI> who attended the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in these Expeditions ate the Livers, that being one
of their principal Dishes. 'Tis scarce to be be∣lieved
what numbers of Cattel they kill'd here;
they destroy'd above a hundred thousand after this
manner only for the Fat and Livers, and so made
the Country desolate by this needless slaughter,
which brought such a Famine and Misery upon the
Inhabitants, that they died for want of Food:
They besides carried away out of this Province all
the Corn they did not burn; so that tho the Coun∣try
<PB N="106" REF="63"/>
produces abundance, there was so great a Scar∣city,
that a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Septier is a measure of Corn containing about 240 pound weight.</NOTE> Septier of Corn was worth ten
Crowns, and a Lamb was sold for the same Price.</P>
<P>The Commander of these Troops being return'd
from the Sea-Coast, resolv'd to leave the Province
of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> and to join <HI>John Ampudia.</HI> To ac∣complish
this Design he raised above two hundred
Men Horse and Foot, among which were divers
Citizens of <HI>Quitonia.</HI> He gave 'em leave to bring
with them the <HI>Caciques,</HI> and all the other <HI>Indians</HI>
which had formerly fallen to their share, and to
add as many others to 'em as they pleas'd, which
they did. One <HI>Alphonso Sanchez</HI> carried with him
his <HI>Cacique,</HI> whose name was <HI>Nenuyta,</HI> with a hun∣dred
other <HI>Indians</HI> and their Wives. <HI>Peter Cobo</HI>
accompanied him with a hundred and fifty <HI>Indians</HI>
and their Wives, who were forc'd to drag their
Children after 'em, for fear they should perish with
Hunger. One <HI>Moran,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Popayan</HI> carried
above two hundred People with him; and all the
rest of the Souldiers did the same proportionably
to their Stock and Occasions. They desir'd permis∣sion
to make all the Indian Men and Women that
attended 'em their absolute Slaves, which was
granted; and this Privilege continued as long as
they liv'd, tho these <HI>Indians</HI> were the Subjects and
Vassals of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> as well as the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
themselves.</P>
<P>With such an Equipage as this our General left
the City of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> to go take possession of that
of <HI>Octaba,</HI> which fell to his lot. He demanded of
the <HI>Cacique</HI> five hundred Men to join his Forces,
which were deliver'd to him, with divers other
Persons of Note. Part of these <HI>Indians</HI> he distri∣buted
<PB N="107" REF="63"/>
among his Souldiers, and took the rest to
himself, some of whom were loaded with Chains,
and others with his Baggage and Provisions. 'Twas
a lamentable sight to see these poor Wretches tied
one to another with Cords. When these <HI>Spaniards</HI>
parted from the Province of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> they carried
away no less than six thousand <HI>Indians,</HI> of which
scarce twenty came back to their own Country;
for the extreme Fatigues and scorching Heat they
endur'd in those hot Countries soon cut 'em off.</P>
<P>The General having made <HI>Alphonso Sanchez</HI> Cap∣tain
of a Company, this Brute meeting some
Women and Children in his way, loaded with
Provisions, and waiting for him to present him
with what they had brought, massacred 'em all
without pity. In this cruel Action, a <HI>Spaniard</HI>
going about to kill an Indian Woman broke his
Sword in two the first blow he gave her; at the
second stroke he broke it again, so that he had no∣thing
but the Hilt left in his hand: but that which
is more surprizing is, that this poor Woman re∣ceiv'd
no Wound by the blows he gave her. Ano∣ther
Souldier striking an Indian Woman with a
large Dagger, had about three Inches of it broken
off at the first stroke, and the whole Blade quite
to the Hilt at the second.</P>
<P>When this General, of whom we have been
speaking, parted from <HI>Quitonia,</HI> he cruelly sepa∣rated
Husbands and Wives one from another,
giving the young Women to the <HI>Indians</HI> that went
with him, and leaving the old Women to those
that remain'd in the City. One of these Women
follow'd him with loud Cries when he went away,
and beg'd of him with abundance of Tears, that
he would not take away her Husband from her,
telling him she had the charge of three Children,
and 'twould be impossible for her to provide for
<PB N="108" REF="64"/>
'em if she were bereav'd of her Husband; so that
they must necessarily be starv'd. The General re∣puls'd
her not without some Indignation, upon
which she redoubled her Sighs and Cries, telling
him her Children were ready to die with Hunger:
at length seeing her Prayers and Tears made no
Impression on him, she took a Stone and dash'd out
the Brains of all her Children in his sight.</P>
<P>When this Commander arriv'd in the City of
<HI>Palo,</HI> which is situate in the Province of <HI>Lilia,</HI> he
met with Captain <HI>John Ampudia,</HI> who went before
him to make a discovery of the Country, and to
settle Peace in it: he was now Governor of this
City, which had a Garison in the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s
Name, and was under the direction of the Mar∣quess
<HI>Francis de Piccaro,</HI> who had establish'd a
Council there consisting of eight Counsellors, that
had the Inspection of the whole Country, and kept
it in Peace and Union by the good management of
<HI>Peter Solano de Quenon. Ampudia</HI> hearing our Ge∣neral
was arriv'd in the Country, came to give him
a Visit, accompanied with many of the Inhabitants
and <HI>Indians,</HI> who brought him abundance of Fruit,
and other Provisions. Many of the neighbouring
<HI>Indians</HI> came afterwards on the same Errand, and
after them the Inhabitants of <HI>Xamundia, Palonia, So∣limania</HI>
and <HI>Bolonia,</HI> did the like. But because they
did not bring so great a quantity of Corn as de∣manded,
the General sent a Troop of Souldiers
with a great many <HI>Indians</HI> to seek some elsewhere,
with Orders to take it where ever they found it.
With this Order they went into <HI>Palonia</HI> and <HI>Bolo∣nia,</HI>
where they found the <HI>Indians</HI> dwelling very
peaceably in their Houses; and without any re∣gard
to the Laws of Nations or of Hospitality,
took away all the Corn and other Provisions, to∣gether
with all the Gold and Silver they had, and
<PB N="109" REF="64"/>
put many of the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in Chains to make
Slaves of 'em. These unhappy People came to
make their Complaint to the General of the ill
Treatment and Injustice they had suffer'd, and to
intreat him to cause Restitution to be made of
what had been so violently taken from 'em, but in
vain, for he would do nothing in the matter, only
gave 'em his promise that his Men should do 'em no
hurt for the future, and that they should never come
again into their Country: yet four or five days
after they went into another part of the Country
for Corn, and pillag'd the poor <HI>Indians</HI> as they had
done before; who were so provok'd to see them∣selves
deluded by the General, who had broke his
Promises almost as soon as he had made 'em, that
the whole Country betook themselves to their
Arms in an instant; which Tumult afterwards oc∣casion'd
many Disorders and great Offences to be
commited both against the Majesty of God and
the Dignity of the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> At length these
People fled, and left this whole Country desolate.
They that retreated into the Mountains came down
from time to time to seek Provision; the <HI>Indians</HI>
likewise engag'd in a cruel War one with another,
wherein the stronger party us'd to eat the weaker:
For that Indian Nation that inhabits the Moun∣tains
are a fierce and warlike People, and mor∣tal
Enemies to their Neighbours. After this In∣surrection
the General went to the City of <HI>Ampu∣dia,</HI>
where he receiv'd all the Honours due to his
Character; he afterwards march'd with two hun∣dred
Horse and Foot toward <HI>Lilia</HI> and <HI>Pelinia.</HI></P>
<P>He sent his Captains all round the Country to
make a cruel War upon the <HI>Indians;</HI> they fir'd a
great many Houses, robb'd all that fell into their
hands, and kill'd abundance of 'em. This killing
and pillaging continued many days together. The
<PB N="110" REF="65"/>
Lord of the Country hoped to put a stop to these
Miseries, and to allay the bloody Rage of these Ty∣gers
by sending their Subjects to 'em with all sorts
of Provisions and other Presents. Soon after this
they came to <HI>Lilia</HI> with all the <HI>Indians</HI> they had
taken, for they would not discharge one of 'em.
They pass'd through <HI>Ycea</HI> in their way, and were
no sooner arriv'd there, but they fell to pillaging
and massacring all they met with; they exercis'd
their usual trade of firing their Houses, they con∣sum'd
above a hundred of 'em in one Village; nor
did other Towns and Cities in the neighbouring
Country, which they call <HI>Tulilicui,</HI> fare any better.
When the <HI>Cacique</HI> at the head of a great company
of <HI>Indians</HI> came to meet 'em, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Com∣mander
demanded Gold of him and his Subjects:
they told him they had no great quantity, but
would readily give him all they had; and accor∣dingly
brought him that little they had got toge∣ther.
Upon which he deliver'd a kind of Receipt
sign'd with his own hand to each of 'em, which was
to serve for a token by which to distinguish those
that had given him Gold from the rest; adding,
that whoever had not this Receipt should be ex∣pos'd
to the Dogs to the devour'd by 'em. The
poor Creatures terrified by these Menaces, brought
him all the Gold they had in very great haste, and
those that had none were fain to retire into the
Mountains, or into other Cities to save their Lives;
and thus the Country was depriv'd of the greatest
part of its Inhabitants. A little after he order'd
the <HI>Cacique</HI> to send two <HI>Indians</HI> to the City of
<HI>Agua,</HI> to signify that he requir'd the Inhabitants to
meet him, which they might do with safety, and
to bring with them all the Gold they could. After
he had dispatch'd this Order, he went to another
City, and the same might sent a party of <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="65"/>
to seize some of the People of <HI>Tulilicui,</HI> who
brought him a hundred Men and Women the day
following, of which he reserv'd the most robust
and lusty, whom he thought fit to carry great Bur∣dens,
for himself and his Souldiers, and put many
of 'em in Chains, giving the young Children to
the <HI>Cacique</HI> of <HI>Tulilicui</HI> to eat, in whose House their
Skins fill'd with Ashes are still to be seen. After
this Expedition he went toward the Provinces of
<HI>Calili,</HI> where he join'd Captain <HI>John d' Ampudia,</HI>
who was gone another way to make a further
discovery. These two Commanders left great
marks of their Cruelty in all the Provinces through
which they pass'd. <HI>Ampudia</HI> happen'd to come
to a certain City, the Governor of which, whose
name was <HI>Bitacon,</HI> had made deep works under
ground to hinder the approach of an Enemy:
Two of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Horses, that of one <HI>Antony
Redondon,</HI> and that of <HI>Marc Marqués,</HI> fell into these
Traps, and the latter of 'em dy'd with the fall,
but the other escap'd the danger. However this
small loss by the Stratagem of the <HI>Indians</HI> so pro∣vok'd
this Captain, that he order'd his Men to
take all of 'em they could light on, which was
about three hundred, and to cast 'em into these
Pits; besides this they fir'd a hundred Houses.
From hence they came to a very great and populous
City, here they had no Interpreter by whom to
converse with these <HI>Indians;</HI> however they massa∣cred
abundance of 'em with their Swords and
Lances. As soon as these two Commanders met
one another again after all these Expeditions, <HI>Am∣pudia</HI>
gave the other a relation of what he did at
<HI>Bitaconia,</HI> and told him how many <HI>Indians</HI> he had
cast into the Pits that were made at the entrance
of the City, while the other applauded all he had
done, telling him he had reason to serve 'em after
<PB N="112" REF="66"/>
that manner: And added, that for his part he had
destroy'd above two hundred <HI>Indians</HI> near the Ri∣ver
<HI>Bamba,</HI> which waters the Province of <HI>Quito∣nia.</HI>
Thus these two Tyrants made War upon all
this Country at the same time. They both after
this enter'd into the Provinces of <HI>Birumia</HI> and
<HI>Anzerma,</HI> where they left everlasting tokens of
their Barbarity and Fury. One <HI>Francis Garcia,</HI>
whom they sent out to pillage the Country, treated
the People with abundance of Insolence, till he
reduc'd 'em to extreme Indigence and Misery.
The <HI>Indians</HI> came to him by couples, making
signs to desire Peace for the whole Country, pro∣mising
to give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all they should de∣mand,
and to deliver up their Gold, and their
Wives too, provided they would give 'em their
Lives; but receiv'd no other Answer from this
cruel <HI>Garcia,</HI> but that they must be gone, for he
had drank too much, and was now in no condition
to consider of what they said. He enter'd their
Country full of Fury, and running through the
whole Province, put it all under Military Execu∣tion,
robbing, and spoiling, and massacring the
Inhabitants without mercy: he carried away
two thousand of the People with him, who were
put in Chains, and dy'd under the rigor of their
cruel Bondage: And before he left this Country
he put fifty more to a violent Death.</P>
<P>After he had fill'd this Province with misery
and horror, he passed into the Province of <HI>Calili.</HI>
When any of the <HI>Indians</HI> that carried his Baggage
fainted with weariness, and fell under their Bur∣dens
in the way, they kill'd 'em on the spot, to
terrify the rest by these bloody Actions, that none
of 'em might dare to pretend themselves sick to
get rid of their Burdens and Labours. And thus
they were all destroy'd by degrees; for partly be∣cause
<PB N="113" REF="66"/>
they were not sufficiently look'd after, and
partly because unreasonable Labour was exacted of
'em, there was not so much as one of all those <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
left alive, which they brought from <HI>Quitonia,
Pastonia, Quilla, Cangapatra, Popaya, Lilia, Calicia,</HI>
and <HI>Anzerma.</HI> As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return'd, they
past through a great City, where they put most
of the Inhabitants to the Sword, and carried away
300 Prisoners, whom they inslav'd according to
their usual manner.</P>
<P>The General sent <HI>John Ampudia,</HI> when they
were in the Province of <HI>Lilia,</HI> with a considerable
Party of Soldiers into those parts of the Country
most inhabited, to take as many <HI>Indians</HI> as he could
to carry the Baggage; because not one of that num∣ber
they brought from <HI>Anzerma</HI> and <HI>Allia,</HI> which
amounted to about 1000 Men, was able to endure
the Fatigue, but all died in the way. They here
took as many as they had occasion for to carry their
Baggage, and the rest were left to the discretion
of the Soldiers, who put 'em in Chains, and kept
'em till they were starv'd; so that this Country
was quite unpeopled, neither <HI>Spaniards</HI> nor <HI>Indians</HI>
being now to be found in it. After all these Ra∣vages,
they advanc'd toward <HI>Popaya,</HI> leaving
<HI>Martin d' Aquirra</HI> by the way, he being unable to
follow the rest. As soon as they arriv'd at <HI>Popaya;</HI>
they form'd a Garison in the City, and treated the
Inhabitants with the same Insolence and Violence
they had us'd in all other parts of the Country where
they had made their Progress. Here they coined
Money with the King's Image and Arms upon it;
they stamp'd all the Gold they had, as well as
that which <HI>John d' Ampudia</HI> had got by his Rob∣beries,
after this manner. All this Gold was
melted by the General's Order, without keeping
any Account of it, or paying any of the Soldiers,
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>
unless it were such as had lost their Horses; so
that he kept almost all the Gold for his own private
use. He pretended indeed to take the 5<HI>th</HI> part of
it, which is the King's due, and to go to <HI>Cuzco</HI> to
give an Account of it to his Majesty's Intendent;
but took another way, and return'd into the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Quitonia,</HI> taking up many <HI>Indians</HI> as he went,
who all died under the heavy Yoke of their slavery.
He afterwards effac'd the King's Image, which he
had stamp'd upon this new Money. And 'tis re∣markable
concerning this Man, that he could not
but reflect on all the mischief he had done, and on
the Cruelties he had committed; for he was wont
to say of himself, Whoever shall come into these
Provinces 50 years hence, and be told what kind
of life I led here, will say, <HI>Such a Tyrant went this
way, and here are everlasting marks of his Violence
and Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be conceal'd from <HI>Your Highness,</HI> that
the rest of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> who came into the <HI>Indies</HI>
after him, have endeavour'd to tread in his steps,
and have exactly follow'd the Example he set 'em;
for they have committed the same Injustice and
Villany and so they still continue to do.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="proposed reforms">
<P>Among the other Remedies propos'd by the Lord
<HI>Bartholomew de Las-Casas</HI> in the Assembly of Prelats
and Learned Men whom the King call'd together at
<HI>Valladolid,</HI> to reform the Affairs of the <HI>Indies,</HI> in
the year 1542, he advises, That the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
should take the <HI>Indians</HI> under his protection, and
consider 'em as his lawful Subjects, that by this
means they may be shelter'd and guarded from the
continual Tyranny and Insolence of their Enemies,
and not be utterly extirpated by Massacres, which
have bin so often committed with Impunity. For as
fruitful and populous as this New World has been,
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>
it will soon be laid entirely waste, and turn'd into a
barren Desert, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be still suffer'd to
root out the Inhabitants, as they have hitherto
done.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="bishop to the king">
<HEAD>The Words of the Bishop on this Subject are as
follows:</HEAD>
<P>The most proper and best Expedient, and which is
of great importance for your Majesty's Interest, with∣out
which all others will be fruitless, is, that your Ma∣jesty
send express Orders to all your Courts and Tri∣bunals
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to receive all the <HI>Indians,</HI> both
those that have been already subjugated, and those
that shall be conquer'd for time to come, into the num∣ber
of your free Subjects, that all the Provinces they
inhabit be united to the Kingdoms of <HI>Castile</HI> and
<HI>Leon,</HI> and that all the Inhabitants be incorporated
as your own People, so that they shall not be capa∣ble
of being inslaved by any <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and that this
Law and Order be inviolably observ'd: that for the
future these new Provinces may not be dismember'd
and alienated from the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> under any
pretext whatsoever, tho never so great necessity
should be pretended; and never so pressing inter∣cession
be made with your Majesty to obtain the Ti∣tle
of a particular Soveraignty for any one: That
all the world may know that the Government
of those Provinces that are subdued in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
is inseparably united to your Majesty's Crown,
and a part of your Property. That to confirm this
Constitution the better, and to render it the more
solemn and inviolable, your Majesty would please to
take an Oath upon the Holy Gospel, on your Crown,
and all that is most sacred, in the form and manner
Princes are wont to do on such Occasions, that you
will never revoke this Edict; and that your Succes∣sors
<PB N="116" REF="68"/>
be oblig'd to take the same Oath: And that your
Majesty take care to make it one express Article of
your last Will and Testament to engage your Succes∣sors
to observe this Law, and to make others ob∣serve
it, as much as lies in their Power.</P>
<P>Divers reasons are afterwards produc'd to shew
that this Policy is of absolute necessity for the Pre∣servation
of <HI>America,</HI> and to hinder the utter Extir∣pation
of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The insatiable Covetousness of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
mind nothing but to amass together heaps of Trea∣sure,
makes 'em unwilling to suffer any Priest or
Monk to come into those Cities where they are
Masters, for fear their worldly Interest should receive
considerable damage by that sort of Men; because
(they say) it makes the <HI>Indians</HI> idle, to assemble 'em
(as they do) to instruct 'em in the matters of Reli∣gion;
for all the time they take up to preach to 'em,
they detain 'em from the Work imposed on 'em.
Sometimes when the poor <HI>Indians</HI> have been assem∣bled
for their instruction in Christianity, the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
have insolently accosted 'em with Cudgels in
their hands; taking such a number of 'em as they
think fit, to carry their Baggage or any such like Ser∣vice;
and if they are unwilling to obey, they force
'em to it with Blows in the sight of all the rest,
and in the presence of the Monks that instruct 'em;
which is a great Scandal to our Religion, and a
mighty Obstacle to their Conversion, who are
strangely terrified and hinder'd in these pious Exer∣cises
as well as the Monks that preach to 'em, by
this ill usage.</P>
<P>Another Inconvenience the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend they
receive from these Instructions, is, that when the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
are converted and plac'd in the number of Chri∣stians,
they grow proud and insolent, thinking bet∣ter
of themselves than they are, and refuse to work so
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
hard as they did before. For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are very
ambitious to command the <HI>Indians</HI> as their absolute
Slaves, and to be obey'd, respected, and even a∣dor'd
by 'em; and therefore omit nothing that may
hinder them from becoming Christians.</P>
<P>Sometimes 3 or 4 Towns or Villages are given
up to the disposal of a certain number of <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and the Inhabitants distributed among 'em, to some
more, to others fewer; and it often happens that
a Woman falls to one Man's share, whose Husband
falls to the Lot of another, and their Children to
a third; so that they divide these miserable Fami∣lies
like Flocks of Sheep. They employ 'em in all
sorts of service, as to manure the ground, to work
in the Mines, and to carry Burdens in Journeys of
50 or 60 Leagues. And their Masters so constantly
exact the hard Tasks of Work they set 'em, that the
poor Wretches have not time to attend the Instructi∣ons
of the Divine Word, and to learn the Rules of
Christianity. These People, tho free, have been
made Slaves, and the greatest part of 'em destroy'd.
Parents and Children have been slaughter'd toge∣ther;
Villages and Cities entirely ruin'd, and not
a House left standing. And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no
more regard to their Salvation, than if their Souls
and Bodies died together, and were uncapable of
eternal Rewards or Punishments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> undoubtedly have an Obligation of
Duty upon 'em to instruct them in the Doctrine of
Christ; but they are so ignorant themselves, that
'tis not much to be wonder'd at, if they take no care
to inform others. I knew one <HI>John Colmenero</HI> in the
Isle of <HI>St. Martha,</HI> as dull, as ignorant and whimsi∣cal
a fellow as one should meet with, to whom the
care of instructing the <HI>Indians</HI> in a great City was
committed, tho he scarce knew how to make the
sign of the Cross; and when he was examined about
<PB N="118" REF="69"/>
the course he took to instruct the <HI>Indians,</HI> could
make no other answer, but that he taught 'em to say,
<HI>Per signin sanctin Cruces.</HI> By which one may easily
guess at the profound Understanding of the Man.
And how indeed is it possible for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to
teach the <HI>Indians</HI> Christianity, and to inform 'em
what is necessary to Salvation, when the most no∣ted
Spanish Lords, and such as make the greatest fi∣gure
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> scarce know how many Com∣mandments
there are? For they go into <HI>America</HI>
only to gratify their insatiable Covetousness. They
are generally given to all sorts of Vices; and so im∣modest,
voluptuous and effeminate, that if a just
Comparison were made between them and the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
these latter would be found to have much
more Virtue and Honesty: For as ignorant and bar∣barous
as they be, they are content with one Wife
according to the Laws of Nature, as a necessary help
to 'em; whereas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lay aside all respect to
the will of their Maker, and take 14 or 15 Women,
or as many as they please, to satisfy their brutish
Passions, how opposite soever this Plurality of Wives
is to the Law of God. The <HI>Indians</HI> scarce know what
it is to take away one another's Goods, and live in∣nocently
by their Neighbours, without offering 'em
any Violence or Oppression. And what thoughts
must such People as these have of those that call
themselves Christians, when they see 'em commit
all manner of Crimes and Villanies; when they
see 'em guilty of so much Injustice and Treachery,
and in a word, of all the Abominations of which
men that are left of God, and have no principle of
honour or conscience can be capable? This makes
many <HI>Indians</HI> laugh at the God we worship, and
persist obstinately in their Incredulity. They be∣lieve
the God of the Christians to be the worst of
Gods, because his Worshippers are the worst of
Men.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="69"/>
As for your Majesty, they think you are the most
cruel and impious Prince in the World, while they
see the Cruelty and Impiety your Subjects so inso∣lently
commit; and they verily believe your Maje∣sty
lives upon nothing but human flesh and blood.
Probably this account may very much surprize your
Majesty, who perhaps have not yet receiv'd suffi∣cient
information about these matters; but this Opi∣nion
is of long standing, and become inveterate
among 'em. I could produce a great many Instances,
of which I have been an Eye-witness, to convince
you of the Truth of it; but I am afraid of making
your Majesty too uneasy, and of filling the Reader's
mind with too much horror, by reciting such extra∣ordinary
and unparallel'd Stories, which may give
a just occasion of Wonder, that God has so long
defer'd to inflict some exemplary and terrible Judg∣ment
upon <HI>Spain,</HI> to punish all the Abominations
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have committed in the <HI>Indies.</HI> The
Pretence of subjecting the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Govern∣ment
of <HI>Spain,</HI> is only made to carry on the design
of subjugating 'em to the Dominion of private Men,
who make 'em all their Slaves. One <HI>Spaniards</HI> who
has the Government of a Town or City, does more
mischief by his vitious and scandalous Example,
than a hundred Priests and Monks can do good in en∣deavouring
to advance Christianity by all their
Piety, and the exemplary Sanctity of their Lives.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have the Government of any
place committed to 'em, or have any personal con∣cern,
or special interest in it, they'l be sure to op∣press
and harass the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and offer 'em all
the Abuses that can be. And 'tis now become almost
impossible for your Majesty or your Ministers to stop
the Course of these Oppressions, and regulate these
Disorders; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> terrify the <HI>Indians</HI> by
their threatnings, and sometimes kill 'em to prevent
<PB N="120" REF="70"/>
their complaints against 'em: and of this kind of
Cruelty we have many Instances: So that the poor
<HI>Indians</HI> are continually molested and harassed, with∣out
any calm Intervals in which to compose their
Minds, and therefore are not capable of applying
their Thoughts to the consideration of Divine
things. Their whole Life is spent in Sorrow and
Anguish under their Persecutions and Torments.
This makes 'em mortally hate your Majesty, and
abhor the Christian Religion; for they can't but
think you impose a severe Yoke on 'em with intole∣rable
Tyranny, that you are the most covetous
Prince upon Earth, and that therefore they ought
to leave no stone unturn'd to get clear of your Go∣vernment.
The despair under which they lie, occa∣sions
'em to belch out a thousand Curses against our
God, attributing all the Miseries they suffer to him,
whom they accuse of Blindness, Injustice, and want
of Compassion, for not punishing the Outrages com∣mitted
against 'em under the pretence of obliging
'em to embrace his Religion, and for not chastising
the Impiety of such as make a boast of being his
Servants, while they are guilty of the highest Abo∣minations.
This inflames their Zeal towards their
false Gods, which they say are much better than
ours, who has brought all manner of Miseries upon
'em, whereas their own were the Authors of all
kinds of Blessings.</P>
<P>We shall make it evidently appear to your Ma∣jesty,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in about eight and thirty or
forty years have unjustly put to death above twelve
Millions of your Subjects; and what an incredible
damage must your Majesty have farther sustain'd by
these Massacres, as they have hinder'd all these Peo∣ple
from multiplying, who would have amounted to
an infinite number, the People of this new World
being very fruitful, and the Climat generally ve∣ry
<PB N="121" REF="70"/>
temperate and pleasant, and consequently very
proper for Generation? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have massa∣cred
and destroy'd all these Nations, to possess
themselves of their Country, and to usurp the Go∣vernment
of it, so as to have it entirely at their
disposal. And how injust soever those Wars have
been which they have made upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> if the
poor Creatures put themselves in a posture of De∣fence,
they cruelly cut their throats without any
distinction of Quality, Sex or Age: Such as escape
their Fury they reserve for Slaves, many of whom
they condemn to the Gold or Silver Mines, others
they yoke together like Beasts to make 'em carry
vast Burdens. They don't much concern themselves
whether the <HI>Indians</HI> live or die, provided they reap
some advantage by their Labour, and heap up Gold
at any rate in the World. I pass over in silence a
great many of the Torments these poor People have
been made to endure on all occasions. If any shall
attempt to perswade your Majesty of the contrary,
we'l undertake to prove what Violence the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
have us'd among the <HI>Indians</HI> by invincible and
undoubted Evidence: And shall not scruple to say,
that whoever take upon 'em to deny the truth of
these matters, have in all appearance partaken of
those Robberies, or at least hope to have a share of
'em one time or other. For what shew of proba∣bility
is there in saying the Contagion of the Air
has so entirely destroy'd the People of a Country of
2500 Leagues extent, that there's scarce a Man to
be found?</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who know no other God but their
Interest, have sullied the Reputation of the poor <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
with the most odious Stain that can be imagin'd,
in accusing 'em of being addicted to an infamous
and abominable Sin against Nature; a Calumny as
ill contriv'd as 'tis unjust. For that Crime has never
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>
been heard of in the Islands of <HI>Hispaniola, St. John,
Cuba,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which have been very populous.
This I can speak with assurance, as knowing it to be
true, because I took care to inform my self of it
as soon as I came ashore in the new World. Nor
is it so much as known what this Vice is in all <HI>Peru:</HI>
not one Man has ever been found guilty of it in the
whole Kingdom of <HI>Yucatan;</HI> and the like may be
asserted in general of other Countries of <HI>America:</HI>
Only 'tis said, that in some very remote parts of
it there are some People addicted to this monstrous
Crime: But is it reasonable for this to accuse the
whole new World, and to cast an everlasting Re∣proach
on so many different Nations? We must say
the same of another Enormity charg'd upon the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
namely their eating of Human Flesh. There
are indeed in some particular places a sort of Men
so barbarous that they eat their own kind; but 'tis
very injust to take occasion from this to report the
same of all <HI>America</HI> in general. Another pretence
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> use, by which to justify their ill Carriage
towards the <HI>Indians,</HI> is their Idolatry; as if it did
not belong to God rather than to them, to punish
those that offend him by such abominable Worship
when he sees meet.</P>
<P>Besides, the Lands and Territories they possess are
not under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor are
the <HI>Indians</HI> oblig'd to own any other Governors than
their lawful and natural Soveraigns. Our Ancestors
before they were instructed in the Doctrine of
Christianity, were buried in the gross darkness of
Idolatry as well as the <HI>Indians.</HI> And before the
coming of Christ, all the Nations of the World in
general were guilty of that Crime. But that which
evidently proves the Minds of the <HI>Indians</HI> to be ve∣ry
susceptible of our Religion, is the Mildness, Hu∣mility
and Courtesy they at first express'd to the
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the patience wherewith they have
since undergone their Cruelties.</P>
<P>'Tis a most inexcusable piece of Wickedness in
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they have made use of all the
Obstructions they could, and that deliberately, to
hinder the <HI>Indians</HI> from imbracing the Christian
Faith; they have driven away all the Monks that
came into the <HI>Indies</HI> to preach the Gospel, from those
places where they had power enough to do it, be∣cause
they did not care these Religious Persons
should be Witnesses of the Tyranny and Cruelty
they exercis'd on the poor People. They have even
debauch'd the <HI>Indians</HI> by the ill Example they have
set 'em, and taught 'em a great many Vices they
never heard of before they conversed with the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> such as Oaths and Blasphemies against the
Name of Christ, the Practice of Extortion, Lying,
and many other Sins that seem'd opposite to the
sweet and peaceable Temper of these People: So
that to leave these poor <HI>Indians</HI> under their Govern∣ment,
is visibly to expose 'em to utter Destruction,
and to make 'em miserable both in Soul and Body.</P>
<P>King <HI>Ferdinando</HI> was so far impos'd on by the Ar∣tifices
of some self-interested Men, as to give 'em
leave to transport the Inhabitants of the <HI>Lucay</HI>-Islands
into <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> these People were forc'd out
of their Houses, and out of their Country, in pur∣suance
of this Grant, which was subtily obtain'd,
and occasion'd the destruction of above a hundred
thousand People; so that there now remain but
eleven of 'em in fifty Islands, some of which are
bigger than the <HI>Canaries,</HI> that were well stor'd with
People. And this I can affirm on my own know∣ledg,
if your Majesty could have seen the Ravages
and Massacres that have been committed in the <HI>Lucay</HI>
Islands, you would have been pierc'd with the most
lively sentiments of Compassion; and then I should
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>
have been afraid to incommode your Majesty by re∣viving
the memory of that Tyranny, in giving an
exact Recital of it. We have taken notice above of
the injust Wars the <HI>Spaniards</HI> formerly rais'd against
the <HI>Indians;</HI> we have shewn how they massacred 'em
against all Law and Equity, how cruelly they de∣priv'd
'em of their Children, their Parents, and
Friends; how they have laid waste one of the finest
Countries in the World, and render'd it in a man∣ner
destitute of Inhabitants. This Barbarity makes
the Earth groan, the Angels lament these Miseries:
And God himself has given us to know by the Judg∣ments
he has inflicted on us, how much these injust
and violent Actions displease him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken from the <HI>Indians</HI> all
they had; they make 'em work till they spit Blood,
they expose 'em to all sorts of Hardships, and ex∣act
intolerable Tasks of 'em; and, which is yet more
horrible, after all they load 'em with heavy Blows,
beating, whipping and tormenting 'em with the ut∣most
Cruelty. To give up the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Go∣vernment
and Tyranny of these Men, is as great a
madness, as to give Children into the hands of Men
that are acted by a raging Phrenzy, and have
Knives and Daggers ready in their hands to cut their
Throats; or to sacrifice Men to the fury of their
sworn Enemies, who have long entertain'd the desire
of Revenge, and form'd a design to murder 'em; or
to expose a young beautiful Virgin to the Discretion
of an impudent Ravisher. Who in such a conjuncture,
without the interposition of special Grace, would
abandon himself to the Conduct of his Passions?
In a word, it would be the same thing as to give 'em
up to so many wild Bulls, Wolves, Lions and Tigers,
when inrag'd with pressing Hunger: for all the Pro∣hibitions
that should be given these wild Beasts not
to touch such as are expos'd to their fury, would
<PB N="125" REF="72"/>
have just the same effect to prevent 'em from being
devour'd, as any Charge that can be given the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
to hinder 'em from murdering the <HI>Indians</HI> to
possess themselves of their Gold and Silver. We
dare assure your Majesty after the long Observation
we have made of these matters, that if your Ma∣jesty
should order a Gibbet to be set up at every
<HI>Spaniard</HI>'s door, and should swear upon your Crown,
that you would cause every Man to be hang'd that
should kill or offer any considerable Injury to the
<HI>Indians</HI> to get their Riches; this would not be an
effectual Remedy to these Disorders, if your Ma∣jesty
gave 'em any Authority or Power over
'em either directly or indirectly. The same occa∣sions
of doing mischief would still present, and
defeat all the Prohibitions that could be made, and
all the Punishments that could be us'd to terrify
'em.</P>
<P>Nor are the poor <HI>Indians</HI> expos'd only to be made
Slaves by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but suffer abundance of Op∣pression
from a cruel Tyrant, that has the Govern∣ment
of each Town or City, who has a severe Eye
over 'em, to see how they acquit themselves of
their Labors, and perform the Tasks impos'd on 'em.
His business is to plague and torment 'em so many
different ways, that their Sufferings are almost be∣yond
comparison; he beats 'em with Cudgels, tears
their Flesh with Whips, and causes burning drops
of Fat to be distill'd on their naked Bodies. He is
continually exercising his Invention in contriving
new Tortures, he violates their Wives, takes away
their Turkeys, which they count one of their great∣est
Treasures; these Fowls serve him to make Pre∣sents
to the General, who is superior to all these
petty Tyrants. But 'tis impossible to give a parti∣cular
description of all the Punishments these poor
Wretches endure; and after all to stop their Com∣plaints,
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>
they threaten to accuse 'em of Idolatry.
Thus the poor <HI>Indians</HI> are subject to the Authority
of several different Powers, to your Majesty, to their
<HI>Cacique,</HI> and to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor, besides twen∣ty
other little Tyrants, destitute of Reason, Honor
and Conscience, who commit all sorts of Outrages;
and likewise the <HI>Moors</HI> whom the chief Tyrant em∣ploys
to rob and oppress the poor <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis much to be fear'd that Almighty God will
make <HI>Spain</HI> feel some extraordinary marks of his
Displeasure and Indignation for these enormous
Crimes: nay, there appear already some tokens of
the Divine Anger against the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation, for
the Disorders and Devastations made by some in the
new World: for tho God had laid up such quanti∣ties
of Treasure there, that it may be said neither
<HI>Solomon</HI> nor any other Prince ever possess'd a stock
of Gold and Silver comparable to that which the
People of these vast Regions enjoy'd; yet they have
bin so pillag'd, that now there's little remaining
among 'em: But that which is more unaccountable
is, that there's scarce any of that Silver now to be
found, that was so common in <HI>America</HI> when the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> first discover'd it. This makes every thing
extraordinary scarce there, so that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
reduc'd to extreme Poverty and Indigence.</P>
<P>All the while <HI>Larés</HI> govern'd the <HI>Indies,</HI> there was
no more care taken to instil the Principles of
Christianity into the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and to put 'em
in the way of Salvation, than if they had no Souls
to save. This General applied himself only to plun∣der
the great Cities, and would give a hundred <HI>In∣dians</HI>
to one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and fifty to another, as he
had more or less respect for 'em. He made no
distinction of Age or Condition, but promiscuously
distributed old Men, and big bellied Women, as well
as others, Persons of Eminency and Princes as well
<PB N="127" REF="73"/>
as the common People, to oblige his Favorites; as
if these <HI>Indians</HI> were his absolute Property. Their
new Masters made 'em work in the Gold Mines, or
employ'd 'em in any other Service they pleas'd;
and without regard to their Rank or Quality, ob∣lig'd
'em to bear this slavish Yoke till they dy'd.</P>
<P>This Governor suffer'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to confine
eighty thousand of 'em in the Mines, who were all
married Men, while their desolate Wives were forc'd
to labor in the Villages, in digging the ground,
making Ditches, and throwing up Banks, a sort of
work fit only for the strongest Men, and the rather
because they had neither Shovels nor other Instru∣ments
proper for their business. In other places
they put 'em upon spinning and other works of that
kind, which they found would turn to account; and
would sometimes keep Husbands and Wives from
seeing one another a whole year together; and when
they met after this long separation, they were often
so fatigued, and consum'd with Hunger and Labor,
that they were incapable of Multiplication. Some∣times
the Children dy'd for want of Sustenance,
their Mothers Milk being exhausted with hard La∣bor
and Hunger; by this means there dy'd seven
thousand Infants in the space of three months in the
Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> of which I was an Eye-witness. Some
of the Women transported with despair strangl'd
their own Children; others that were with Child
took poisonous Herbs to destroy their Fruit. Thus
the Men dy'd with hardship in the Mines, and the
Women in the Villages; so that the whole Country
became desert in a little time, because the Women
ceas'd to bring forth Children into the World.</P>
<P>This Governor deliver'd up all the <HI>Indians</HI> to the
Discretion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and suffer'd 'em to treat
'em with all the Rigor and Severity they pleas'd,
and to oppress 'em with the hardest Labor they
<PB N="128" REF="74"/>
could. They employ'd Men to chastise 'em that
were more savage and barbarous than Tygers, these
scourg'd and beat 'em most unmercifully, and gave
them all the ill Treatment they could devise; they
would never discover the least sign of Kindness or
Pity, but always shew'd themselves austere and bar∣barously
cruel. It would be very inhuman to treat
the <HI>Moors</HI> themselves after this manner, tho they
are so very cruel to the Christians, and do 'em all the
mischief they can, when they have the Ascendent
over 'em. But the <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally a good-humour'd,
easy, peaceable, submissive, and tractable
sort of People. Some of 'em have by the many
Miseries they suffer'd, been driven to despair of any
mitigation of 'em, and therefore fled into the Moun∣tains,
where they expected Death every moment.
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> to hinder 'em from flying after this
manner, appointed a bloody Fellow to make it his
whole business to hunt out these <HI>Indian</HI> Refugees up∣on
the Mountains. The Governor besides establish'd
a sort of Officers in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Cities of great Con∣sideration
and Authority, whom he call'd Visitors;
to each of these he gave a hundred <HI>Indians</HI> to serve
him, besides his ordinary Domesticks, the better to
support his Dignity. He chose such to this Office
as had signaliz'd themselves by their Cruelty. When
the <HI>Alquazils</HI> presented the <HI>Indians</HI> they found on the
Mountains to these Visitors, there were Persons
suborn'd and instructed to accuse 'em after this
manner; <HI>This Indian is a lazy Dog, that fled into the
Mountains to avoid Work, therefore I desire he may
be chastiz'd as he deserves.</HI> After the giving of
this Evidence, the Visitor us'd to cause the poor
<HI>Indian</HI> to be tied to a Stake, and beat with a tarr'd
Rope, which the Seamen call a Salt-Eel, and indeed
is like a Rod of Iron, till the Blood would start out
in I know not how many parts of his Body, and the
<PB N="129" REF="74"/>
poor Creature would lie for dead upon the place.
God is witness of all the Cruelties these miserable
Innocents have endur'd: 'Tis not possible to re∣count
the hundredth part of what I have seen with
my own Eyes. A man had need have a Body of
Iron to undergo the Labor they endure in getting
Gold out of the Mines. They must delve and search
a thousand times over in the bowels of the Moun∣tains,
till they dig 'em down from top to bottom;
they must work the very Rocks hollow. After this
the Gold must be wash'd in some River, and the
poor Creatures that do this work must be perpe∣tually
in the Water, which gradually alters and
spoils the Constitution of their Bodies; and if the
Mines happen to be full of Water, they are forc'd
to empty 'em. That your Majesty may the better
judg of the Labor and Toil they suffer in the Gold
Mines, your Majesty may please to consider, that the
Pagan Emperors accounted this the worst and most
intolerable Punishment to inflict on the Martyrs,
next to Death it self. The <HI>Indians</HI> are sometimes
kept a whole year in these Mines: but since the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
have observ'd, that it kill'd most of 'em to
keep 'em there so long together, because their Bo∣dies
were uncapable of sustaining the Fatigues of
such a tedious and continual Labor, they resolv'd to
make 'em work only for the space of five months
successively, and then to give 'em a respite of forty
days, wherein they employ'd 'em in melting Gold.
But this pretended Rest did 'em no great good, for
they were not much less incommoded during this
time than before, being employ'd in other very
troublesom kinds of Work. The <HI>Indians</HI> don't
know what Holy-days are; for they work as hard
and as long on those days as at other times. Nor
have they a sufficiency of Bread allow'd 'em; and
what they have is a very ordinary sort, that has
<PB N="130" REF="75"/>
not much strength in it, being made of Roots and
Cassave; so that if they don't eat Flesh or Fish with
it, it yields very little Nourishment. They like∣wise
give 'em a sort of Pepper that grows in the
Country, and looks much like a dry'd Grape.
Those <HI>Spaniards</HI> that pretend to keep their Slaves
extraordinary well, distribute a Porker every week
among fifty <HI>Indians;</HI> but he that presides over 'em
at the Mine keeps one half of it for his share, and
gives them the other, which is but every one a bit.
Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are so wretchedly covetous,
that they send their Slaves into the Fields and Moun∣tains
to feed upon what Fruit they can find, and
then oblige 'em to work two or three days without
giving 'em any thing to eat. Your Majesty may
easily imagine, that such kind of Food can't possibly
sustain their weak and languishing Bodies, that are
continually enfeebled and exhausted with hard La∣bor;
or that these poor Creatures that are mace∣rated
with all manner of Hardship and Fatigue,
without any rest, or relaxation of their Misery, can
live long under the pressures of so cruel a Servi∣tude.</P>
<P>The abovemention'd Governor at last order'd
they should have Wages distributed among 'em, <HI>viz.</HI>
that three<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Blanc is about the value of a Half-penny.</NOTE> Blancs should be given each of 'em to
spend every two days, as the Reward of the hard
Labors they exacted of 'em. This was only to mock
the poor Wretches, for this Mony would scarce
buy 'em the least Trifle. But for many years they
had nothing at all given 'em, yet this does not
disturb 'em so much as want of Victuals; for there
is nothing in the world they so much desire as to
eat well, insomuch that if they could but satisfy
themselves with one good Meal, they would after∣wards
<PB N="131" REF="75"/>
be content to die. This Governor depriv'd
'em of all the liberty they enjoy'd, and suffer'd the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to inslave 'em, and treat 'em as severely
as they pleas'd; and indeed the ill usage they have
met with is beyond what the Mind of man can ima∣gine.
They have not the liberty to dispose of any
thing they have: The condition of Beasts is prefera∣ble
to theirs, for these are at least sometimes turn'd
loose to fill their Bellies with Grass in the fields, and
have a little ease and liberty; whereas the poor
<HI>Indians</HI> have scarce any time of rest allow'd 'em,
but are constrain'd to do whatever the covetous
<HI>Spaniards</HI> command 'em. They lead 'em to work
like Beasts of Burden rather than Men. If at any
time they give 'em leave to go home to take a little
Repose, they neither find their Wives nor Children
there, nor any thing to eat, and have no other re∣lief
than to lay themselves down and die. The in∣credible
Fatigue they undergo wears 'em out the
sooner, because they are naturally of a weak and
tender Constitution; and when they are sick and
faint, they are still made to work without any Com∣passion:
nay, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are so cruel as to beat
and abuse 'em when they are just ready to die, calling
'em lazy Rascals, as if they refus'd to work, and
feign'd themselves sick, merely out of Idleness. At
last when they see their Illness increase to that de∣gree,
that they can expect no more Service of 'em,
they send 'em home, giving 'em six or seven great
Roots, almost like Turnips, with a small quantity
of Cassave, to carry 'em a journey of fifty or sixty
Leagues; so that they often miserably languish and
die before they have proceeded far on their way:
we often found a great many of 'em dead on the
Roads, others we found ready to expire, and others
by their Groans and Sighs gave us to understand
their extreme Hunger. When the Governor had
<PB N="132" REF="76"/>
not a sufficient number of Men for the Works in
the Mines, he supplied the places of them that were
releas'd by death, by casting Lots for others, which
method was observ'd once a year.</P>
<P>When he enter'd into the Continent, he came
like a sweeping Judgment of God, or as a Wolf
among Sheep: He committed so many Robberies,
Massacres and Cruelties, depopulated and destroy'd
so many Towns and Cities, giving the <HI>Spaniards</HI> li∣berty
to do what they pleas'd, that no History can
parallel his Barbarity: He robb'd both the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> and his Subjects, without being ever call'd to
account for it; he left above forty Leagues of a
very populous and fertil Country to the discretion
or rather fury of his Soldiers: All that pleasant
Tract of Ground from <HI>Daria</HI> where he landed to
<HI>Nicaraqua</HI> was reduc'd to the utmost Desolation;
so that five or six Millions of Mony will not re∣pair
the Damage done there. This vile and cruel
Man abandon'd the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Tyranny of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> which was the source and original Cause
of all the Persecutions under which those poor Peo∣ple
have since groan'd, and of all the Devastations
that <HI>America</HI> has suffer'd wherever the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have set their feet. This Contagion by degrees
spread far and near; so that this General by let∣ting
loose his Soldiers after this licentious manner,
has occasion'd the ruin of many millions of Men,
and the desolation of divers great Kingdoms that
were subjected to your Majesty's Dominion. If we
say the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have destroy'd seven Kingdoms
bigger than that of <HI>Spain,</HI> we can speak it with
confidence, as knowing it to be true, and having
known the time when they were fill'd with multi∣tudes
of People, tho now there are scarce any to
be found, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having extirpated the Peo∣ple
of these large Kingdoms, and left the Walls
<PB N="133" REF="76"/>
and Houses of the Towns and Cities without Inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>Your Majesty has no fix'd and constant Revenue
in the <HI>Indies;</HI> your Effects are like Leaves, which
when once they fall from the Trees appear no more
till a year after. That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are possess'd
of the absolute Government of the <HI>Indies</HI> is the
true cause of this Disorder; for the number of the
<HI>Indians</HI> every day decreasing, your Majesty's Re∣venues
must necessarily receive a proportionable di∣minution.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> is in great danger to be
invaded by Foreign Nations, especially by the <HI>Moors</HI>
and <HI>Turks,</HI> who perhaps may one day be in a con∣dition
to destroy it: For God is a just Judg, and
cannot look upon the Villanies and Oppressions, the
Robberies and Murders of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
without indignation. All the Nations of this new
World, who were created (as well as his others) af∣ter
the likeness and image of God, and ran∣som'd
by the precious Blood of Jesus Christ, have
been unjustly and cruelly tormented and persecuted
by 'em; they have made horrible slaughters among
'em to requite the many Kindnesses they heap'd on
'em with all imaginable Freedom and Civility. And
that which still aggravates their Crimes the more,
and must needs farther provoke the Divine Displea∣sure,
is, that God had made choice of <HI>Spain</HI> to car∣ry
his blessed Gospel into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to bring
many populous Nations to the knowledg of himself;
for which if they had fallen in with his Designs, he
would, besides those eternal Rewards reserv'd for
'em, have given into their hands many good and
fruitful Countries, abounding with Mines of Gold
and Silver, Diamonds and other precious Stones
and Pearls; in a word, with all sorts of temporal
Blessings, beyond what any one can imagine, unless
<PB N="134" REF="77"/>
such as have seen it with their own eyes. And 'tis
to be remark'd that God usually observes this Rule
in the execution of his Judgments, to proportionate
his Penalties to the Crimes committed against him.</P>
<P>The Outrages and Cruelties these innocent People
have felt are so horrid and notorious, that their
Tears and Groans and Blood, the cry of which has
reach'd the Throne of God, will undoubtedly draw
down Vengeance on those that have offer'd all this
violence to their Persons, and plunder'd 'em of their
Estates. The Report of these Cruelties is spread
through the whole World, and has been carried even
to the most barbarous Nations, and has made 'em ab∣hor
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and conceive a mortal hatred a∣gainst
'em: A hatred which extends to the Person of
our King, as well as Subjects, and is extremely
prejudicial to the whole Nation in general.</P>
<P>None can be so ignorant as not to foresee what
Mischiefs the Desolations in <HI>America</HI> are like to
bring upon <HI>Spain;</HI> and succeeding Generations will
be but too much convinc'd of the truth of this Pro∣phecy:
And if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> still suffers the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to domineer and tyrannize as they have hi∣therto
done in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and makes not effectual
provision by proper Edicts to stop the Course of the
many Miseries the People of this New World un∣dergo,
those Countries will in a little time be totally
depopulated. And God will undoubtedly make all
<HI>Spain</HI> feel the Effects of his Wrath in punishing such
Crimes as these; since the whole Scripture is full of
Threatnings, and plain Instances of the Judgments
of God on such as have been accessory to the Sins of
others by permitting them.</P>
<P><HI>Most Illustrious and Mighty Prince;</HI> The Royal
Council for the <HI>Indies,</HI> animated with a sincere Zeal
for the Glory of God, and your Majesty's Honour,
desir'd me a few days ago to write to your Majesty
<PB N="135" REF="77"/>
all that I had told you <HI>viva voce</HI> before, and to ex∣plain
to you what Right the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have to
those Kingdoms in the <HI>Indies:</HI> and the rather be∣cause
some who are uneasy to see the liberty your
Majesty is pleas'd to give me in conversing with
your Royal Person about these Affairs, to engage
you to regulate those Disorders committed in <HI>Ameri∣ca,</HI>
have declar'd against my Sentiments with a great
deal of heat and animosity. They say the Zeal
with which I oppose the Violence and Injustice of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (and these I'm resolv'd to oppose as
long as it pleases God to continue my life) prompts
men to call in question the Title the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
pretends to have to the New World. However I
have perform'd what the Council demanded of me,
and drawn up thirty Propositions, without giving
my self the trouble of proving them at large, partly
because they are all certain and evident, and partly
because I was much urg'd to dispatch the business,
and to send them to your Majesty; which I have ac∣complish'd
in the fear of God, and according to
the dictates of my Conscience, with a strict regard
to Truth.</P>
<P>Since the desire I have of being serviceable to God
daily increases, I thought my self oblig'd to refute
the Impostures and Calumnies of some ill-designing
Persons, who wilfully shut their eyes against the
Truth, because 'tis directly opposite to the Designs
and Projects they have form'd. They flatter them∣selves,
that under the false pretext of serving the
Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> who are ordinarily of a sweet and
benign temper, and ready to judg of others by the
good Sentiments they find in themselves; I say, they
flatter themselves that they shall still be able to im∣pose
on 'em, and bear a sufficient sway in their minds
to bring 'em into the snares they have laid for 'em.
It was the complaint of <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> in the History of
<PB N="136" REF="78"/>
<HI>Esther,</HI> that corrupt and vicious Subjects alter'd the
good disposition of Princes, and betray'd 'em into
Excesses, that occasion'd the ruin of whole King∣doms
and their Kings together. 'Tis for this rea∣son,
<HI>Great Sir,</HI> I have briefly drawn up these Propo∣sitions,
to set this matter before you in a clear light.
This I have done to discharge my own Conscience,
and that I might the better answer the Obligations of
that Ministry wherewith God has entrusted me. I
find my self growing old, being advanc'd to the 50<HI>th</HI>
year of my age; and the great acquaintance I have
had with the Affairs of <HI>America,</HI> has furnish'd me with
a very distinct knowledg of 'em; so that my circum∣stances
render me in some respects more capable
than others of giving proper Advice to those that
are propos'd for the Government of <HI>America,</HI> that
they may know how to put a period to its Mise∣ries:
for I have no other intention or desire in this
matter, than that of suppressing the Injustice and
Cruelty that has so long harass'd the Inhabitants of
the New World.</P>
<P>They that endeavour to cross my good Design
with the greatest warmth, and deck themselves with
a false appearace of zeal and affection to your Ma∣jesty,
tho at the bottom they have no regard either
to truth or justice, take care to hide their Designs
under the specious colour of promoting your Ma∣jesty's
Service and Interest, and of establishing your
Majestiy's Right and Title to <HI>America,</HI> while indeed
all they do is directly contrary to your Majesty's Ser∣vice,
whether in respect of Spirituals or Temporals.
And I believe all intelligent Christians, that have a
true zeal for their Religion, will be of this opinion,
when I have made the Errors and Extravagancies of
those that oppose my Sentiments appear; for these
Gentlemen hand over head maintain that the Kings
of <HI>Spain</HI> have a Right to found and establish them∣selves
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>
a Title to the Government of <HI>America</HI> by
force of Arms, after the same manner that <HI>Nim∣rod,</HI>
who was the first mighty Hunter (as the
Scripture expresly observes) and first began to
tyrannize over Men, laid the foundation of his
Dominion; or as <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and the
antient Romans extended the bounds of their Em∣pire;
or just as the Turks to this day oppress the
Christians, and invade their Territories. All the
World may easily perceive that they who reason thus,
are ignorant of the true Interest of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
and shamefully violate all the Rules of Justice. To
prove what they advance, they add new Errors to their
first Extravagancies, till they shew by the wretched
Maxims they expose, that they have neither Honor
nor Christianity. For it often falls out, that while
they who wander from the Tract of Truth and Vir∣tue,
go about to excuse the Errors they have made,
they fall into other Mistakes that are still more gross
and dangerous.</P>
<P>There are others of 'em who produce Titles that
appear to be somewhat better founded, and alledg
Arguments that seem more probable and honest.
These say we may justly take possession of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
and subdue the People, because we have a greater
stock of Prudence and Wisdom than other Nations,
and because our Country is nearer to the <HI>Indies</HI> than
many others. But 'tis easy to see that none of these
Reasons are concluding, having no solid Foundation
to support 'em.</P>
<P>That your Majesty may the better comprehend
the force of the Reasons that have been produc'd be∣fore
you, and more easily distinguish what is agree∣able
to the Rules of Equity from what is con∣trary
to 'em, and discern your faithful Servants
from such as mind nothing but their own Interest,
I shall come my self, and <HI>viva voce</HI> explain to your

is founded. In the mean time I send your Majesty
an Abstract of my Propositions, which your Majesty

<P>Among all the Instruments that can be chosen

the Obstructions that impede the publication

advancing this Work, and to send such of their Sub∣jects

<P>To avoid confusion, the Vicar of Christ may di∣stribute

<P>In making this division the Pope ought not to re∣gard
the increase of the Honors, Titles, Riches and

the Conversion of the Infidels; since this alone is the
Intention of Christ in the trust he reposes in 'em, to
take care of the Instruction of Souls, which is a dif∣ficult

In this affair they ought to have no temporal Advan∣tage

as transitory and of small consequence: Yet it would
not be just, if they can do any thing for the advan∣tage

that they have taken a world of pains to rescue
those Kingdoms which they inherited from their

imminent danger, when they attempted to enter
again into the Kingdom of <HI>Grenada,</HI> to which they
had a lawful Title, and which they at length re∣duc'd
under the Yoke of Christ, and the Catholic

that they sent the famous <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> to

our Saviour used to introduce his Religion into the

For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> employ 'em night and day
in the Mines, and all other kinds of Labor; some∣times
obliging 'em to carry heavy Burdens forty or
fifty Leagues, so that their condition is worse than
that of Beasts. Besides, they persecute those <HI>Indians</HI>

<HEAD>XXIX Proposition.</HEAD>
<P>The distribution which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> make of

<HEAD>A Dispute between Don Bartholomew de Las-Casas,

<P>DR. <HI>Sepulueda,</HI> at the instigation of some <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
who had committed great Ravages in
the <HI>Indies,</HI> wrote a very elegant Book in Latin in the
form of Dialogues, which contain'd principally two
Conclusions, namely, that the Wars of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in the <HI>Indies</HI> were very just, and that they might
lawfully subjugate the People of this new World;
and that the <HI>Indians</HI> were oblig'd to submit to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and acquiesce in their Government, be∣cause
these are more wise and prudent than the
others. And in case they refuse to submit, this
Doctor asserts, that they may be constrain'd to it
by force of Arms. These are the two Points that
have occasion'd the ruin of incredible numbers of
<HI>Indians;</HI> so that the Country is almost entirely un∣peopled
for the space of two thousand Leagues,
where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have left the marks of their
boundless Cruelty. This Doctor, to give some co∣lor
and shew of Truth to his Reasons, declar'd that
he had no other design in writing than that of justi∣fying
the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Title to the <HI>Indies.</HI> He
presented his Book to the Royal Council, and was
very importunate to obtain leave to print it, which
was several times refus'd; after which he ap∣plied
himself to some of his Friends, who were in
the Emperor's Court, to patronize this Work. The
Bishop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> being well inform'd of the steps
this Doctor made, with all his might oppos'd the
Impression of his Book, plainly demonstrating what
ill Consequences the publication of it might pro∣duce.
The Members of the King's Council per∣ceiving
<PB N="151" REF="85"/>
this matter was purely Theological, resolv'd
to dismiss it to the Universities of <HI>Salamanca</HI> and
<HI>Alcala,</HI> desiring them to make a thorow Examina∣tion
of this Treatise, to see if it contain'd any thing
that might justly obstruct the printing of it. These
two Universities after they had accuratly examin'd
it, declar'd that it was not fit to be printed, as
containing unsound Doctrine. The Doctor now
despairing of seeing his Book obtain in <HI>Spain,</HI> sent
it to <HI>Rome,</HI> earnestly recommending it to the Bishop
of <HI>Segovia,</HI> who was one of his particular Friends.
When it was printed, it was prohibited by the Em∣peror's
express Order, who caus'd the Copies to be
seiz'd, forbidding any of 'em to be sold in <HI>Spain:</HI>
but because it was impossible to prevent divers Co∣pies
in the vulgar Language from being spread
among the People; the Bishop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> thought
himself oblig'd to refute this Book in defence of
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to let all the world know how scan∣dalous
Doctrine it contain'd, being accommodated
to open a door to all manner of Disorders. Dr. <HI>Se∣pulueda</HI>
was cited to give an account of his thoughts
on this Subject by word of mouth, and the Bishop of
<HI>Chiapa</HI> was engag'd to answer him: The Dispute
lasted five whole days, after which <HI>Dominic de Soto,</HI>
a great Divine, and Confessor to his Majesty, was de∣sir'd
to give a summary account of this Dispute,

without offending his Conscience, in con∣forming
himself entirely to the Bull of Pope <HI>Alex∣ander.</HI>
'Tis first necessary to enquire whether the
Emperor may justly make War with the <HI>Indians</HI>
before the Faith of the Gospel be preach'd to 'em;
and whether these People will be in any condition to
receive the Light of the Gospel, after they have
bin subdu'd by force of Arms; whether they will
be more tractable and docil, and better dispos'd to
receive the Impressions design'd to be given, so as to
reject their Errors, and embrace the Doctrine of
the Gospel. Dr. <HI>Sepulueda</HI> maintains, that this War
is not only allowable and lawful, but necessary.
The Bishop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> is of the contrary Opinion,
and pretends that this War is unjust, and an invin∣cible
Obstacle to the propagation of the Faith in the
<HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sepulueda</HI> supports his Opinion by four principal
Arguments: The first is founded on the enormous
Crimes of which the <HI>Indians</HI> have bin, and are eve∣ry
day guilty, especially their Idolatry, and their
Sins against Nature. His second Reason is taken
from their Barbarity and Ignorance, which may be
reform'd under the Government of a People so in∣telligent
and polite as the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> His third
Reason respects the facility he supposes of publish∣ing
the Christian Faith to the <HI>Indians</HI> when they are
once subdu'd. His fourth Argument is taken from
the cruel Treatment the <HI>Indians</HI> give one another, in
that they offer human Sacrifices to their false Gods.
He confirms his first Reason three ways: 1<HI>st.</HI> By
<PB N="153" REF="86"/>
Examples and Authorities taken out of the holy
Scripture. 2<HI>dly.</HI> By the Suffrage of Doctors and
Canonists. 3<HI>dly.</HI> By a particular account of the
gross Crimes which the <HI>Indians</HI> commit. He cites
a Passage out of <HI>Deut.</HI> 20. to explain after what
manner War ought to be made on the <HI>Indians;</HI> the
words are these: <HI>When thou comest nigh unto a City
to fight against it, then proclaim Peace unto it. And it
shall be, if it make thee answer of Peace, and open unto
thee, then it shall be that all the People that is found there∣in,
shall be Tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
thee. And if it will make no Peace with thee, but will
make War against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: And
when the LORD thy God hath deliver'd it into thy
hands, thou shalt smite every Male thereof with the
Edg of the Sword:</HI> ver. 10, 11, 12, 13. and <HI>ver. 16.
But of the Cities of these People which the Lord thy God
doth give thee for an Inheritance, thou shalt save alive
nothing that breatheth.</HI> The Doctor adds, that this
Passage is not to be strictly taken, and enforc'd a∣gainst
the <HI>Indians</HI> with so much severity: tho 'tis al∣so
said, <HI>Thus shalt thou do unto all the Cities that are very
far from thee;</HI> by which Passage the Gloss understands
those of different Religions. From hence he con∣cludes,
that we may lawfully declare War against
those Nations that are of a Religion different from
ours.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Bishop</HI> answers him four ways. First, he
says, it was not to punish the Sin of Idolatry, that
God commanded the <HI>Israelites</HI> to make War with
the Gentiles and Infidels: That God was pleas'd to
single out precisely seven Nations, the <HI>Canaanites,</HI>
the <HI>Jebusites,</HI> &amp;c. mentioned in <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. who possess'd
the Land of Promise bequeathed to <HI>Abraham</HI> and
his Posterity. He allows it to be true, that God de∣sign'd
to punish the Idolatry of those Heathen Na∣tions,
in giving 'em up to the <HI>Israelites;</HI> but he says
<PB N="154" REF="87"/>
if God's intention had bin only to chastise 'em for
their Idolatry, he would also have punish'd all the
Nations of the whole World after the same manner,
seeing they were all polluted with the same Sin.
Whereas God specified only these Nations to be
abandon'd to the Sword of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> to shew
that it was rather to accomplish the Promise he had
made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> than to punish these Idolaters
that he deliver'd 'em into the hands of their Ene∣mies.
That God himself expresly forbad the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI>
to offer any Violence to the <HI>Edomites,</HI> or to the
<HI>Egyptians</HI> who had entertain'd 'em when they were
strangers in their Country.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Passage of <HI>Luke</HI> 14. where it
is said, <HI>Compel them to come in,</HI> is not to be under∣stood
of an external Constraint by War and Arms,
but ought to be interpreted of internal Inspiration,
and the Motions which God produces in the Hearts
of Men, either immediatly, or by the Ministration
of Angels.</P>
<P>In the third place the Bishop maintains, that Chris∣tian
Emperors have never engag'd in War with
Heathen Nations to oblige 'em to renounce Idolatry,
and to induce 'em to imbrace the Christian Faith;
that the Wars of <HI>Constantine</HI> were purely on a po∣litic
account, and that the Passage of the Eccle∣siastical
Historian, <HI>lib. 10. cap.</HI> 6. is to be understood
in that sense. That this Prince who was so ani∣mated
with Piety, when he subdued by his Arms the
<HI>Goths, Sarmatians,</HI> and other barbarous Nations, ex∣cepted
those that sought his Friendship, and desir'd
Peace. That because he subjected himself to the
Divine Commands, God was pleas'd to recompense
his Virtue in subjecting all the People of the World
to his Dominion. Besides, he says, <HI>Constantine</HI> made
War with the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> because they
made incredible Ravage and Spoil wherever they
<PB N="155" REF="87"/>
came. But when these barbarous People were at
peace with the Christians, and offer'd 'em no Injury,
they were suffer'd to live at quiet.</P>
<P>He adds in the 4<HI>th</HI> place, That if we would do a∣ny
good upon Pagans, it must be by the power of
good Examples, and not by Violence. He cites to
this purpose a passage of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> who says it
belongs only to men transported with Rage, and to
Assassins to use force against those that are inferior to
'em in Power: that this Father also condemns such
as were not able to do the Pagans any hurt, and yet
rashly offer'd themselves to death, to gain the repu∣tation
of Martyrs. He also quotes a Passage out of
<HI>Deut. 7. When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the
Land whither thou goest to possess it,</HI> &amp;c. ver. 1. <HI>Ye
shall destroy their Altars, and break down their Images,
and cut down their Groves, and burn their graven Images
with Fire,</HI> ver. 5. Upon which Passage he says St. <HI>Au∣gustin</HI>
expresses himself after this manner: Many of
the Pagans have Idols in their Fields, must we take
upon us to break these Idols in pieces? 'Tis much
better to endeavour to get 'em out of their Hearts.
When they have embrac'd Christianity, and exhort
us themselves to break these Idols, we shall do it with
pleasure. We must in the mean time pray for their
Conversion, without appearing violent and passio∣nate
against 'em because of their Idolatry: We are
not ignorant where they hide their Idols, and yet
we let 'em alone, because God has not given us a
Commission to take 'em away without their leave.
When then does God give us leave to take 'em from
them? Not till the owners of these Idols are become
Christians.</P>
<P>He farther produces the examples of the Apostles
and Martyrs, who took no other course to overthrow
Idols but by their Doctrine. He grants that indeed
on some accounts War may be made with Infidels;
<PB N="156" REF="88"/>
for instance, if they have violently usurp'd the Lands
of Christians, as they have the <HI>Holy-Land;</HI> if they
profane our Churches, break down our Images, and
offer any great outrages to Christians, in hatred and
contempt of their Faith: That when the Emperor
<HI>Constantine</HI> forbad the Heathens to keep their Idols,
it was for fear the Christians should be scandaliz'd
by 'em.</P>
<P>He says, If God severely punish'd the Crimes of
the <HI>Sodomites,</HI> it does not therefore follow that we
may take upon us to punish all Infidels for their un∣natural
Pollutions: That we are to admire the Judg∣ments
of God, but not always to imitate every
thing he does. He says, we may punish Infidels if
they blaspheme the Holy Name of God, or dishonour
the Saints and the Church; if they openly hinder
the publication of the Faith, and if they massacre
those that preach it: but that it is not lawful to de∣clare
War against 'em merely on the account of their
Idolatry, their unnatural Sins, or any other Crimes
they commit among themselves.</P>
<P>And whereas Dr. <HI>Sepulueda</HI> says, The Indians are
a barbarous People, and born for Slavery: the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Chiapa</HI> answers this Objection, in saying,
That we ought not to make War upon Infidels to
bring 'em to the true Religion, which is only to be
demonstrated by genuin Reasons, that the under∣standing
may be captivated according to the words
of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> That it must be a pious Affection to the
Christian Faith that will dispose men to embrace
it; and that care ought to be taken that they may
have no aversion against those that preach it; who
therefore ought by their good Examples to engage
the <HI>Indians</HI> to relish the Doctrine they endeavour to
propagate among 'em: That War is visibly contrary
to this end, because it fills the minds of those Ido∣laters
with horror and indignation against the Chris∣tians,
<PB N="157" REF="88"/>
for bringing so many Miseries upon 'em; and
that they cannot chuse but think the Law of Christ
an execrable Doctrine, since it authorizes (as they
imagin) such terrible Disorders. The Bishop con∣cludes
in saying, 'tis a mere delusion to assert, that
the Wars made against these Infidels are not design'd
to introduce Christianity among 'em by open force,
but only to subjugate those barbarous Nations the
better to dispose 'em to receive the Faith of Christ
voluntarily. He pretends that this is ill reasoning,
because War spreads so much terror among those
People, that if they afterwards embrace the true
Faith, 'tis to be suppos'd they do it rather out of fear
than love: and that their Neighbours when they hear
what Violence, Spoil, and Massacres have attended
this War, may probably, to avoid the like Mischiefs,
blindly embrace the Faith, without knowing what
they do themselves.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Sepulueda</HI> urges for another reason of War,
that the <HI>Indians</HI> massacre innocent Persons, either to
sacrifice, or to eat 'em. To which Argument the
Bishop returns this answer, That if the Church ex∣horts
us to undertake the defence of Innocents, it
ought not in this case to be by the way of Arms.
First, because of two Evils we ought to chuse the
least. If the <HI>Indians</HI> massacre some innocent Persons
to eat 'em, 'tis indeed a great Evil; but War would
bring much greater slaughters with it: besides, that
these Wars dishonour our Religion, and render the
Christians odious to the Infidels; who tho they sa∣crifice
men, are not altogether inexcusable, because
of their great Ignorance, and have reason not to
put themselves into the hands of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldi∣ers,
who come with their Swords in their hands to
rob and kill 'em, instead of instructing 'em in Reli∣gion;
whereas they have no right to punish 'em for
their Errors: That <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, when the <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="89"/>
subdued divers barbarous Nations, who were wont
to offer men in Sacrifice, they did not punish 'em for
that Crime, but only forbad 'em to do the like for
the future. That it is not to be expected of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
that they should renounce their Errors in a mo∣ment;
that the light of Nature which informs 'em
there is a God, teaches 'em to shew him respect, and
to return him thanks for the Benefits they receive
of him, and likewise to endeavour to make atone∣ment
for the Sins they commit against his Divine Ma∣jesty;
and that they ought to devote the best they
have to him in Sacrifice: Consequently their evil
Custom of sacrificing human Creatures to the sup∣pos'd
Deities they worship, is the less to be wonder'd
at, since they have no knowledg of Divine Revela∣tion,
but only the glimmerings of natural Light to
direct 'em; which Light too is obscur'd with much
thick darkness in the minds of Pagans. That these
People believe they perform a very acceptable Ser∣vice
to God, when they offer him the Lives of Men;
that this may be confirmed in some sort by the Te∣stimony
of Holy Writ, seeing God, when he would
try the faithfulness of <HI>Abraham,</HI> commanded him to
sacrifice his only Son, whom he tenderly lov'd;
which God might do, as he is the absolute Master of
the Lives of Men: that besides this Instance, the
Scripture testifies that God requir'd the <HI>Israelites</HI> to
redeem their own Lives by the sacrifice of Animals.
That the Word of God remarks, that 'tis impossible
to give a greater Testimony of Love, than to offer
ones self for the Person belov'd: that those Women
in the <HI>Indies</HI> that were most dear to their Husbands
while they lived, chose to be buried alive with 'em,
to give the greater proof of their conjugal Fidelity
and Affection.</P>
<P>In answer to the other Argument alledg'd by Dr.
<HI>Sepulueda,</HI> namely, that the barbarity of the <HI>Indians</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="89"/>
which (he says) shews they were born for Slavery,
is a sufficient reason to declare War against 'em, in
order to subject 'em to the Government of the <HI>Eu∣ropeans:</HI>
the Bishop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> says, there are three
different sorts of <HI>Barbarians.</HI> First, that this Term
is taken in general to signify any Nation that differs
from others by some strange Opinion, or peculiar
Customs, tho they want not Prudence or Policy to
conduct their Affairs. That the second kind of
<HI>Barbarians</HI> is of those, who have no Language pro∣per
by which to express themselves to other People;
such as the English formerly were, when they had
no Letters or Characters whereby to explain their
Thoughts. The third sort of <HI>Barbarians</HI> are such as
resemble savage Beasts, by the dulness and stupidity
of their Minds, by their brutish Inclinations, and by
the extravagance of their Customs; who wander up
and down in the Fields, never dwelling together in
Towns or Cities; who are without Laws or Civil
Government, and take no care to observe the Law of
Nations; who rove about to commit Robberies,
and use Violence on all that have not power enough
to resist 'em; such as the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Alans</HI> were for∣merly,
and such as the <HI>Arabs</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> are to this day:
That 'tis as lawful to make War with this sort of
People, as to hunt wild Beasts, and would be a great
piece of service to the World to reduce 'em to any
tolerable Disciplin. But as for the <HI>Indians,</HI> that
tho they have some extravagant Customs, but
not any good Policy, yet they ought not to be
look'd upon as properly <HI>Barbarians;</HI> seeing they are
of a quite contrary disposition, being meek, civil,
and tractable in their Manners; that they are a nu∣merous
People, who have Cities and Laws, and un∣derstand
divers Arts; that they have Princes over
'em, and live under a kind of regulated Government;
that they not only punish Sins against Nature, but
<PB N="160" REF="90"/>
have Laws that award capital Punishments for some
Crimes of lesser consequence: That their Policy has
its particular Rules; that upon all these Accounts
their pretended Barbarity is not a sufficient Reason
for any to declare War against 'em, but would be a
piece of visible Tyranny and Injustice; and that
this Course would be so far from promoting the
Gospel, that 'twould be the very way to cut off all
hope of establishing Christianity among them. That
therefore the best expedient would be to send
Preachers into the <HI>Indies,</HI> to endeavour to convince
some of the principal <HI>Indians</HI> of the truth of our
Religion; and to make Treaties of Peace with 'em,
to favour the entrance of the <HI>Europeans</HI> into the <HI>In∣dies</HI>
by such a gentle and peaceable Method as this:
that if any danger should arise after this, we might
build some Forts upon the Frontiers, and so treat
with 'em with the greater Security, and make 'em
gradually relish our Religion, by setting 'em good
Examples.</P>
<P>The Royal Council for the <HI>Indies</HI> having heard this
Dispute, between the Bishop of <HI>Chiapa</HI> and Dr. <HI>Se∣pulueda,</HI>
concerning the manner in which the <HI>Indians</HI>
ought to be treated, order'd the Bishop to draw up
his Thoughts of this matter in Writing, whereby
they should be the better able to determin this questi∣on,
Whether they might lawfully inslave the <HI>Indians,</HI>
or were oblig'd to set at liberty all they had hitherto
reduc'd to slavery. In answer to their desire, the
Bishop farther explain'd his Sentiments after the fol∣lowing
manner.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Indians</HI> taken in the <HI>Indies</HI> since the disco∣very
of the New World to this day, have bin un∣justly
inslav'd; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who retain 'em in
bondage against their wills, can't do it with a good
<PB N="161" REF="90"/>
Conscience, because they had no right to declare
War against 'em; for it follows by consequence they
could not lawfully deprive 'em of their Liberty, nor
were they ever authoriz'd by their Prince to make
War upon 'em. Now there are but two Motives
that can render any War just, namely, some righte∣ous
Cause, or the Authority of one's Prince. And
what just motive then could the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have to de∣clare
War against the <HI>Indians,</HI> who never did 'em
any wrong, nor ever gave 'em any disturbance? They
were people they had never seen; they had never
made any descent into any Country that belong'd to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to spoil and ravage it; they had ne∣ver
profess'd Christianity as the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> had
done, who were Christian in the time of St. <HI>Au∣gustin;</HI>
or as the Kingdom of <HI>Grenada,</HI> the Empire
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> did
formerly. Nor can we justly reproach the <HI>Indians</HI> as
declar'd enemies to our Religion, or that they ever
attempted to destroy it by open Persecutions, or se∣cret
Perswasions, by Presents, or any other manner
whatsoever, that can be used to engage Christians to
renounce their Faith, and turn Idolaters: For nei∣ther
the Law of God, nor that of Nations ever
permitted War to be made against any People mere∣ly
to establish Christianity among 'em. Unless any
one will pretend that the Gospel of Christ, which a∣bounds
with Charity, Meekness, and Humanity, ought
to be introduc'd into the World by Force like the
Religion of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> can't say, that they had no other
end than that of protecting the Innocent, seeing
they have made it their whole business to rob, pil∣lage,
and murder the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> taking upon 'em
to usurp their Goods and Lands. Besides, if the
War they undertook had bin in defence of those poor
Wretches the <HI>Indians</HI> unjustly put to death for Sa∣crifices,
<PB N="162" REF="91"/>
it would not have bin carried so generally
thro' the <HI>Indies,</HI> but would have bin a sort of Civil
War kept up only in some particular Places: Nor
would the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have had right even in such Pla∣ces,
to have made Slaves of those whom they took
in such a War.</P>
<P>They can't so much as pretend that ever they had
a Command or Order to this day from their Prince,
to declare War against the <HI>Indians:</HI> 'Tis easy to e∣vidence
such a Fact as this; for the Governors and
Generals have nothing to do but to show their Com∣missions
if they have any. There's not one of 'em
who has any fear of God, or respect for his Prince,
that will pretend to shew any such Commission, ex∣cept
the Vice-Roy <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> and <HI>Don Sebastian
Ramire</HI> Bishop of <HI>Cuenza;</HI> all the rest that have made
War on the <HI>Indians,</HI> are Thieves, and Robbers, Mur∣derers,
and declar'd Enemies of Mankind. Seeing
then the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have had no lawful reason to sup∣port
their Declarations of War against the People
of <HI>America,</HI> nor have bin authoriz'd in such Proceed∣ings
by their Prince, it evidently follows that the
War they have made is injust, and contrary to the
Laws of God and Men, and consequently that the
<HI>Indians</HI> ought not to have bin treated as Slaves.</P>
<P>All the ways the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have us'd to compass
this end of inslaving these People, have bin mon∣strously
wicked, made up of nothing but Fraud and
Treachery, unlawful Tricks and Artifices, and such
unheard of Villanies as can't but fill the Minds of all
that hear 'em with astonishment and horror. Some
to insnare the poor <HI>Indians</HI> that liv'd among 'em,
have constrain'd 'em to own themselves their Slaves
in Courts of Justice: after which extorted Confes∣sion,
the Governors have order'd the King's Arms
to be fix'd upon their Skin with a hot Iron; tho they
were not ignorant what an unlawful Course had been
<PB N="163" REF="91"/>
taken to abuse the poor Creatures. Others hir'd the
<HI>Indians</HI> with a little Wine, or a Shirt, or by giving
'em some other trifle of small value, to bring 'em fa∣therless
and motherless Children, whom they put on
Shipboard, and transported into other Countries,
where they were sold for Slaves, especially into <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
the Islands of St. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> or other
neighbouring Islands. But at first the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
us'd open Violence, attacking the <HI>Indians</HI> that liv'd
peaceably in their Houses, setting their Towns on
fire, massacring some, and after the exercise of all
this Cruelty, carrying away those they could take
alive to sell 'em for Slaves. They us'd without any
formal process, to brand 'em with the King's Arms;
which was enough to make 'em pass for Slaves; and
accordingly they were sold from one hand to ano∣ther,
till they were transported into the Islands.
These were all the forms of Justice the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ob∣serv'd
in carrying away the <HI>Indians</HI> from the Conti∣nent
into the Islands of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> the Isles of <HI>Cuba</HI>
and St. <HI>John,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Pearls, Yucatan</HI> and <HI>Panu∣co.</HI>
And by these execrable Artifices they have since
carried away vast multitudes of People of every
Age, Sex, and Condition, from the Kingdoms of <HI>Ven∣cuéla,
Guatimala,</HI> and <HI>Nicaraqua,</HI> to fell 'em in <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI>
and in <HI>Peru.</HI> They once put 4 or 500 of 'em
in one Ship, the greatest part of whom died in their
passage for want of Food, the Allowance given 'em
being so very small.</P>
<P>At a Town consisting of about 200 people, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> would require the <HI>Cacyque</HI> to send 'em
300 <HI>Indians</HI> at such a certain day and hour, to carry
their Provisions, and work for 'em. The poor
<HI>Cacyque</HI> was mightily concern'd he could not ex∣ecute
this Order, not having People enough in the
whole Town; and not knowing what to do in the
case, desired to have a day or two more allow'd him:
<PB N="164" REF="92"/>
But these Brutes would interpret this delay as an ex∣press
breach of their Orders; and immediately ask∣ing
leave of the Governor to go and fall upon 'em,
would attaque 'em in their houses, cutting the
throats of many of 'em in a barbarous manner, and
carrying away the rest as Prisoners of War, whom
they inslav'd contrary to all Law and Equity. Some∣times
they would order a <HI>Cacyque</HI> to send 'em half
a hundred men to labour for 'em, and would set
'em to what work they thought good, after which
they would embark 'em in Ships and carry 'em away;
and sometimes would mark 'em with the Letters of
their own Names without fixing the King's Arms
on 'em. When they were angry with 'em, they
would load 'em with Chains, and make 'em carry
heavy Burdens beside, for 100 or 200 Leagues. Af∣ter
they had us'd 'em in what Drudgery they pleas'd,
they would sell 'em, tho the <HI>Indians</HI> are as freeborn
as any other Nation. By this means the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have unpeopled the Province of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which
is situate between <HI>Guatimala</HI> and <HI>Nicaraqua.</HI></P>
<P>When they formerly advanc'd far into the Coun∣try
to make further Discoveries of the <HI>Indians</HI> that
liv'd there, these good-natur'd People came to meet
'em loaded with Turkeys, and other Provisions,
which they freely offer'd 'em, but for their kindness
were either hew'd in pieces, or lese made Slaves,
on pretence they were found in Arms in the Fields.
Nor could the Governors be ignorant of these
Violences and Disorders or the Soldiers, since them∣selves
had the best share of the Spoil.</P>
<P>When they had divided those Countries among
themselves, which they had so unjustly usurp'd, and
render'd themselves the absolute Masters of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
as if they had coquer'd 'em in a just and
lawful War, they oblig'd the <HI>Caciques</HI> and natural
Princes of those People to bring 'em such a Sum of
<PB N="165" REF="92"/>
Gold as they were pleas'd to command 'em. If they
had not such a quantity, they told the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
they would willingly give 'em all they had to ap∣pease
'em; but receiv'd a severe reply from these
cruel Men in such terms as these: <HI>If you don't bring
us all the Gold we demand within such a time, we'll set fire
to all your houses.</HI> The poor <HI>Cacyques</HI> would some∣times
make such a return as this in a lamentable
Tone: <HI>Indeed our Country has no great store of Gold in
it; and besides, we have not bin curious to search for
Mines.</HI> Upon such an Account as this the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have fasten'd 200 Stakes at a time in the ground,
and tied the poor Wretches to 'em with terrible
Menaces, and then let loose those ravenous Dogs up∣on
'em, that us'd to be fed with human flesh. It
may be the <HI>Cacique</HI> would be so terrified with such
a horrible Spectacle as this, that he'd go among his
Subjects, and take Children out of every Family,
and give 'em to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for Slaves to pacify
'em. If there were but 2 Children in a house, one of
'em was taken away, and that must be the strongest
and likeliest to do service. When the <HI>Cacique</HI> had
got together such a number of his People as the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
requir'd, he would come to present 'em to them
himself. And it was a most lamentable thing to
hear the Sighs and Crys of Parents, when their dear∣est
Children were ravish'd from 'em, to be transport∣ed
into remote Countrys for Slaves. When these
Children were brought to the Governor to be brand∣ed,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would order the <HI>Caciques</HI> to engage
the <HI>Indians</HI> to testify that they were Slaves, and
the Children of Slaves, and that they were bought
in the Market; and would threaten to burn 'em,
unless they would stand to such Lies as these. And
when the Person appointed to examin them, who
was well acquainted with all these Tricks, would
ask the Children of what Country they were; they
<PB N="166" REF="93"/>
made 'em answer, that they were Slaves, and that
their Parents were so, and that they were bought in
such a Market. After this Examination they were
mark'd with the King's Stamp. His Majesty's Go∣vernors
and Officers are very well acquainted with
all this Roguery of the Soldiers, and have had
too great a hand in the invention of these Artifices,
as appears by their having the largest share of the
Booty.</P>
<P>When the Missionary Monks had got a great num∣ber
of <HI>Indians</HI> together in their Church to instruct
'em in the knowledg of the true God, the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
would suddenly come upon 'em with their
Swords in their hands, and take what number of
'em they thought meet; which could not but much
scandalize the rest, and extremely griev'd the Mis∣sionaries,
who were only told by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that
they wanted Men to carry their Baggage and Provi∣sions,
and so were forc'd to take all patiently. When
they had thus seiz'd the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> they set their
mark upon 'em, and sold 'em for Slaves.</P>
<P>The Governors at first seldom refus'd any that
ask'd leave to plunder the <HI>Indians,</HI> and ruin and de∣polulate
the Country. This was a kind of recom∣pense
they gave 'em for the great Services they had
render'd the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> But afterwards they
took a Course that did not seem so dishonest and
cruel, but was equally pernicious to the People of
the New World, which was to buy Slaves of the
<HI>Caciques,</HI> threatning 'em to burn 'em alive if they
did not furnish 'em with such a number as they de∣manded,
for which they would only give 'em a
Shirt or some such Trifle; so that the poor <HI>Caciques</HI>
became themselves the ruin of their own Country
for fear of being burnt, and made it their business
to go among their Subjects to gather great numbers
of Slaves together, to sasisfy the Avarice of the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="93"/>
At last they would make the <HI>Caciques</HI> pay
'em this tribute with other People; so that they
were constrain'd to go to some of the neighbouring
<HI>Caciques,</HI> and would make their Complaint to 'em
after this manner: <HI>These Tyrant threaten me</HI> (would
one say) <HI>to cut my throat if I don't furnish 'em with
such a number of</HI> Indians <HI>for Slaves, and they won't
suffer me to chuse out some of my own Subjects for 'em;
therefore I desire the liberty to take some of yours, and
you shall have as many of mine for 'em. I am content</HI>
(would the other say) <HI>and the rather because I my
self am oblig'd to pay such a Tribute as you are, and to
seek for Slaves out of my own Country to satisfy the</HI> Spa∣niards.
The <HI>Caciques</HI> themselves were wont to bring
these poor Slaves to be mark'd, and were made to
swear they were none of their Subjects, but that they
had taken 'em among their Neighbors; which was
true, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were never the less guilty in
constraining 'em so to do. The Governors that knew
their injustice and roguery, wink'd at it, and would
never accuse any of 'em of these prevarications be∣fore
the Judges of the Royal Council; for they
made it no part of their care to perform their Duty
to God and the King faithfully; nor did they seem
to be touch'd with the least Compassion in observ∣ing
all the violence committed against those misera∣ble
People.</P>
<P>I could produce a multitude of proofs to con∣firm
what I say, but one shall suffice at present.
There came an Order from the King to the Gover∣nor
of the Province of <HI>Nicaraqua,</HI> to forbid him to
inslave any <HI>Indians,</HI> or to brand him with the King's
Arms: at the same time there was a Ship in the
Road that was design'd to be fill'd with Slaves;
which made the Governor forbear to publish the
Order he had receiv'd, till the Vessel was laden
with <HI>Indians,</HI> and ready to set sail; nay he privately
<PB N="168" REF="94"/>
gave notice to those that were concern'd in the Ship,
to make what haste they could, and carry away as
many Slaves as they needed, because the King had
sent an express Prohibition to hinder any from being
inslaved for the future.</P>
<P>It was once matter of Astonishment to see the
fruitfulness, plenty and multitude of Inhabitants, that
fill'd the Province of <HI>Honduras;</HI> and 'tis now as de∣plorable
to behold the Misery, Desolation, and
want to People there, which resemble it to a melan∣choly
Wilderness. The Governor of this Province
made use of a trick not much unlike that of which
we have been speaking. He ow'd a great Sum of
Mony to some Merchants for Wine and other Com∣modities
he had bought of 'em; who had their
Vessels in the Port, and expected this Governor to
pay 'em in Slaves. But the Emperor's Order forbid∣ding
him to make any Slaves in this Province being
very strict, he durst not take up <HI>Indians</HI> publicly to pay
his debts, for fear of provoking the Emperor by acting
directly against his Command: He therefore sent out
two of his Captains, one to the Sea-Coast, and the
other farther up into the Continent, with Orders to
take up such <HI>Indians</HI> as were likely to make the least
noise and disturbance by their Complaints; these he
order'd to be embarqued, and to prevent to himself
any danger from the Court, he pretended these <HI>In∣dians</HI>
were seditious Persons and Malefactors, whom
he was oblig'd to banish, because it would have been
of ill consequence to have let 'em remain in their
Country: This was the Pretext under which he sold
'em for Slaves to pay his Debts. And with this sort
of Coin the <HI>Spaniards</HI> us'd to buy all sorts of Com∣modities
that came from <HI>Europe,</HI> and whatever else
they thought necessary. So that 'tis no wonder
that those fine and rich Provinces are become for∣lorn
Deserts, since this Trade of buying and selling
<PB N="169" REF="94"/>
Slaves has been allow'd, which was first practis'd in
<HI>Hispaniola.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to deceive the
<HI>Indians</HI> would perswade 'em they should go with
them into <HI>Spain,</HI> when they design'd only to carry
'em to the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and sell 'em there. And
there are many still at <HI>Havana,</HI> that were taken af∣ter
this manner; for when other <HI>Spaniards</HI> heard of
the Stratagems their Countrymen us'd to impose on
the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> they would use the same Tricks,
and brag of 'em instead of being asham'd; so that
the World has been sufficiently inform'd of these Ar∣tifices.
The Miseries and Desolations of the Provin∣ces
of <HI>Nicaraqua</HI> and <HI>Guatimala,</HI> of the greatest part of
<HI>Mexico, Tabesco,</HI> and <HI>Panuco,</HI> are incontestible Proofs
of the Cruelties and other Crimes of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI>
The Archbishop of <HI>Mexico</HI> wrote an Account of 'em
by way of complaint to the Royal Council for the
<HI>Indies,</HI> wherein he inform'd 'em that the Governor
had loaded twenty eight Ships with Slaves. The
Governor of the Province of <HI>Xalisco</HI> took for his
own Share 4560 Slaves, Men, Women and Chil∣dren,
some of whom were but one, others two or
three years old; all was fish that came to net; be∣sides
an infinit number that other <HI>Spaniards</HI> took in
this Province, against the King's express Orders,
who was much displeas'd that those People should
be inslav'd, who ought to have bin instructed in the
knowledge of the true God, and of the Christian
Religion, in order to their Salvation. Those Fle∣mish
Merchants that got possession of the Kingdom
of <HI>Vençuela,</HI> to pillage and destroy it, made horri∣ble
Spoil there for the space of twenty years. That
all I say is the very Truth, may better appear
by consulting the Archives of the Royal Council,
which are full of complaints against the insidious
Contrivances of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the great Violen∣ces
they have committed to enslave the poor <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="95"/>
These poor Wretches have no body to interceed
for 'em, or to protect 'em; and are always in great
consternation, because continually expos'd to the in∣sults
of their Enemies, who oppress 'em without be∣ing
call'd to account for it. So that they despair of
relief, not knowing to whom to address themselves
for justice.</P>
<P>Now seeing the Artifices that have bin us'd to in∣slave
these poor Creatures, are so unjust and tyranni∣cal;
and seeing these People as well as others are
born free, it follows that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have acted
contrary to the Law of Nations, in inslaving all those
<HI>Indians</HI> whom they have taken for that end ever
since the Discovery of the New World, and have
by their Violences evidently transgress'd the Law of
God and Nature.</P>
<P>To prove yet farther that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are ob∣lig'd
to restore those <HI>Indians</HI> their Liberty, whom
they yet detain in bondage, there's only need of
making one reflection, namely, that the Law of God
obliges us to make restitution of every thing we
have taken unjustly from our Neighbours, and to
make reparation for the injuries done 'em; and
without doing thus 'tis impossible to be sav'd. Up∣on
this Principle 'tis evident, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
ought to release their <HI>Indians</HI> Slaves, and to do what
in 'em lies to make 'em amends for the wrong they
have done 'em, against all Law and Equity; for 'tis
not to be suppos'd the sin will be forgiven, till
what has bin unjustly taken away is restor'd; and
consequently the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have treated the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> after so ill a manner, and yet don't go
about to make 'em satisfaction, are under the guilt
of a mortal Sin.</P>
<P>To make this appear yet more evidently, two
things must be suppos'd. First, that there were no
Slaves in <HI>New Spain,</HI> on the Borders of which there
<PB N="171" REF="95"/>
dwelt divers Nations, especially the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> that
are more dexterous and politic than other <HI>Indians:</HI>
This every one knows who is acquainted with
the new World. Secondly, That the term <HI>Slave</HI>
does not signify the same thing among the <HI>Indians</HI> as
among the <HI>Europeans,</HI> but only denotes a Servant
with the former, or one that has some particular
obligation to assist us in our necessary Affairs; so
that to be the Slave of an <HI>Indian,</HI> is to be but one
degree below his Son; 'tis to dwell in his House, to
take care of his Goods and Silver, to wait on his
Wife and Children, which is consistent with the
enjoyment of his Liberty: He sets the House in
order, sows the Land, and does any necessary work,
as occasion requires. And his Master on his part
treats him with a great deal of Kindness and Hu∣manity,
as if he were not oblig'd to render him this
Service. Those Missionaries that have learn'd the
<HI>Indian</HI> Language, and know the import of their
words, can testify the truth of what I say.</P>
<P>It is farther to be suppos'd, that in <HI>New Spain</HI> and
<HI>Mexico</HI> many unlawful ways have bin us'd by the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to inslave the <HI>Indians,</HI> in so much that one
would have thought they knew nothing of the true
God, nor had ever heard of the Precepts of the
Gospel. When there was a Famin there, which sel∣dom
happens in those rich and fertil Countries,
those <HI>Indians</HI> that had a stock of Corn, perswaded
them that were poor to sell 'em their Children for
some of their Corn: with this proposal they com∣ply'd
very willingly, because their Servitude is so
easy, their Slaves not being oblig'd to any very hard
Labor. And the <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally obsequious and
submissive to those on whom they depend; they
would give one of their Children for five Bushels of
Corn, and this was the ordinary Price they gave.
'Tis true, this was an unjust method of making
<PB N="172" REF="96"/>
Slaves, because all things ought to be common in a
time of extreme Necessity; for the Law of Na∣ture
obliges us freely to give or lend to those that
are under pressing want.</P>
<P>Another occasion on which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made
the <HI>Indians</HI> their Slaves was this; when any one had
found an <HI>Indian</HI> with some Ears of Corn which he
had stolen, he had Authority to make him his Slave.
The Missionaries have observ'd that some of 'em
would maliciously scatter Ears of Corn in the High∣ways,
that they might seize those for Slaves that
had innocently gather'd 'em up. Besides this, the
Parents and Relations of him that had the Corn
found upon him were made Slaves for this imagina∣ry
Theft, which is a very unjust and criminal Ar∣tifice.
They likewise had invented a sort of Play
among 'em, in which he that lost was made a Slave;
the best Players would make as if they knew not
how to play, to insnare those that were ignorant
into their Service. If any one whom they had thus
caught, presum'd to run away, his nearest Relations
were forc'd to supply his place. When a Free-man
had lain with a Woman that was a Slave, her Master
had power to seize him, or his Wife, if he were
married, and to oblige him to serve him till she was
brought to bed. Which Custom obtain'd through∣out
the whole Country. He that had a young Maid to
his Slave, would inslave any one that lay with her,
which was attended with great Inconveniences;
for the Masters of these young She-slaves would put
'em upon enticing Men to lie with 'em, on purpose
to catch 'em in this Trap. If a Slave took any thing
out of his Master's House to give it to his Relations,
they all immediately became his Master's Slaves.
When several Merchants went into other Countries
for Slaves to sell in <HI>New Spain,</HI> where they had the
best trade for 'em, they lent those that were poor
<PB N="173" REF="96"/>
their Goods and Corn upon Usury; and when they
were not in a condition to pay for what they had
bought, they seiz'd 'em for Slaves. If he that ow'd
the Sum, died before the Debt was discharg'd, and
his Wife and Children were not capable of paying
the Creditor, they became his Slaves. In time of Fa∣min,
Parents would sell one of their Children to serve
a Master for a certain number of years; but indeed
there was no end of this Servitude, for if the Master
dy'd, his Relations would take possession of his Slave.
But the Bishop of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who is a very pious and
virtuous Prelat, has written an account in Latin of
all the Tricks the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have us'd to inslave the
<HI>Indians;</HI> by which 'tis easy to see with how much
Injustice they have abus'd the Simplicity and Neces∣sity
of these poor wretches to reduce 'em to a mise∣rable
state of Bondage.</P>
<P>From what I have been relating it appears, that
the <HI>Indians</HI> being Idolaters, and destitute of the
knowledg of the true God, and the Rules of Chris∣tianity,
don't regulate their Actions by such Mo∣tives
as the fear of Hell, and the desire of Heaven,
and the hope of having their good Works rewarded
hereafter: Therefore they are vicious and corrupt
in many respects; for instance, they don't observe
the Law of Nations in the Wars they make one up∣on
another; by which one may well guess there are
many other injust things done among 'em.</P>
<P>But the Faith of Christ, and the Precepts of the
Gospel are for preserving only good Laws and
Customs, and for abolishing those that are bad, espe∣cially
such as are opposite to the Law of Nature,
and prejudicial to Human Society. Therefore those
<HI>Indians</HI> that are converted, who have bin guilty of
Polygamy, are oblig'd to put away all their Wives
but one, according to the prescription of the Law
of God, as well as to restore all the Goods they
<PB N="174" REF="97"/>
have gotten by unlawful ways of Robbery or Extor∣tion.
If Christians follow the evil Customs of In∣fidels,
or tolerate 'em when they can hinder 'em,
they manifestly render themselves Accomplices in
the Crimes of those Idolaters, because we are ob∣lig'd
by the Divine Law to abstain from such Actions
as may occasion Scandal, or any way injure the
temporal or spiritual Welfare of our Neighbor.
For this reason St. <HI>Paul</HI> commanded Christians not
to eat things offer'd to Idols, lest it should be
thought they approv'd of those damnable Sacri∣fices;
tho they might eat of those very meats, pro∣vided
the Pagans did not see 'em, and so were not
scandaliz'd by the Action.</P>
<P>All Christians are oblig'd by the Divine Word
to do what in 'em lies for the Abolition of sinful
Customs, or at least to abstain from 'em, and dis∣approve
'em themselves. And when a man doubts
whether any Action he is about to do is just or injust,
he can't do it with a good Conscience: this is a ge∣neral
Rule that admits of no exception, because
Christians are oblig'd by the Doctrin of the Gospel,
rather to lose all they have than to commit the least
Sin. Therefore while the Mind hesitates and doubts,
whether the Action on which one thinks be sin or
no, we ought necessarily to abstain from it. The
very desire of doing such an Action is contrary to
right Reason, and to the Love of God; because it
would be to expose one's self to the hazard of trans∣gressing
the Divine Will, to do that concerning
which one labors under an uncertainty whether it
be lawful or forbidden. And the Doubt, when one
thus ventures to sin, is no longer a mere Doubt,
but most certainly becomes an Offence against God,
because we are always oblig'd to take the safest
course. When it falls out that we meet with two
ways, and are uncertain which is the right, we
<PB N="175" REF="97"/>
ought always to chuse that which is the least dan∣gerous,
according to that Maxim of St. <HI>Augustin</HI>
in his penitential Book, <HI>Take what is certain, and
leave what is uncertain.</HI></P>
<P>The Rules of the Civil Law, which are confirm'd
by Reason, by the Law of Nature, and that of
Christian Charity, admit of a Dispensation in some
cases, when there is a prospect of some great Good,
to which a greater strictness would probably be
prejudicial. But 'tis a general Rule, that when a
Man deliberates on two doubtful things, he is to
determin his choice on that side where he may avoid
Sin, where there are the fewest Inconveniences,
and where his Neighbour's Interest runs the least
hazard. Upon this Principle, Clergy-men ought
not to be oblig'd to retire and live separatly from
their Mothers, Grandmothers or Sisters, or to for∣sake
their Father's House; because such a Separation
may be very disadvantagious to 'em, tho there may
possibly be some Inconvenience likewise in their
dwelling together.</P>
<P>That man retains a thing with an evil Conscience,
about which he is in doubt whether it be lawfully
gotten, or which he has receiv'd of one who had
no right to it, or who had reason to doubt whether
it belong'd to him or no. Whatever is possess'd
under such circumstances, is kept contrary to the
Rules of Justice, and against both the Law of God
and Nature. Therefore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who keep
those <HI>Indians</HI> in slavery, concerning whom they are
in doubt whether they have bin bought, or given
to those of whom they had 'em, act contrary to
Justice and to the Law of God, in retaining 'em
while under this doubt. Every one knows that a
man is oblig'd to restore whatever he does not law∣fully
possess, and whatever he has receiv'd from one
that had no just right to it, because a man can't
<PB N="176" REF="98"/>
communicate a right to another which he has not
first himself. Thus when any one buys or receives
any thing from a Person who sells or gives it, and
yet has no right to it, he is unjust if he keeps it,
and is oblig'd to make restitution. The Reason is
evident, because 'tis no less than the commission of
Theft, wilfully to retain any thing against the will
of him to whom it appertains. And tho this thing
should have past through a thousand hands before it
came to you, you would have no right to withold
it from the proper Owner, because these were all
unlawful Possessors, and consequently ought to have
made restitution. And tho some human Laws give
permission to retain a thing which one has bought
with Mony that is coin'd with the King's stamp, and
is current in the Commonwealth, yet this is no law∣ful
Title to it, because human Laws must not pre∣scribe
contrary to the Law of God and Nature, nor
to good Morals, which forbid Theft, and the with∣olding
of another man's Goods against the consent of
the rightful Owner. Inferiors, and such are Kings
themselves in respect of the Divine Majesty, can't
justly establish any thing in prejudice to the Law of
God, which is superior to all other Laws.</P>
<P>He that buys stolen Goods knowingly, is an Ac∣cessory
in the Robbery: and if he does but suspect
they are stolen, and has not bin so diligent as he
might have bin, to inform himself whether they
were lawfully gotten, he can't keep 'em with a good
Conscience; because no man can innocently do that
which exposes him to Sin. And if we will not take
the pains to inform our selves whether that which
is sold or given to us be lawfully gotten, when we
are in doubt about it, we can't be the lawful Pos∣sessors,
because this is a culpable and wilful Igno∣rance.
Those who have in such cases consulted Men
capable of giving information, are excusable, un∣less
<PB N="177" REF="98"/>
themselves be of such a Character as obliges
'em to be acquainted with Law and Equity, as Ci∣vilians,
Judges, and the like; or when they ask ad∣vice,
content themselves with consulting only one
Person, tho they have opportunity of advising with
many; or ask counsel of interested Persons, and such
as will not answer according to the Dictates of their
Conscience, instead of consulting Men of Integrity
who will give advice according to the Rules of Law
and Equity; or when they address themselves to
Persons whose Honesty is suspected upon good
grounds. A Man is not excusable under such Cir∣cumstances
as these, tho he ask Counsel of the
Learned in the Law; and after having taken their
Advice, acts contrary to Right and Equity. These
four Circumstances being regarded, may be of great
use to ease scrupulous persons of their doubts, and
to give 'em peace of Conscience.</P>
<P>And by these Principles it may be easily known
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> unjustly retain most of their <HI>In∣dian</HI>
Slaves against the Law of God: and if they
have a right to any of 'em, the number is very small,
and they have reason to doubt whether these have
been lawfully made Slaves; because those they have
had from the <HI>Indians</HI> have been brought to 'em as
a Tribute extorted from 'em against their will, by
Fear, Menaces and Torments; so that they have no
just Title to 'em: or if they have bought 'em of
<HI>Indians,</HI> they have us'd unfair tricks to procure 'em,
having terrified the <HI>Caciques,</HI> and constrain'd 'em
by Tortures to deliver up their Subjects into their
hands, threatning otherwise to acuse 'em to the
Judges for worshipping and offering Sacrifices to
Idols; so that the poor <HI>Caciques</HI> when they could
not give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as many <HI>Indians</HI> as they de∣manded,
us'd to steal 'em where they could▪ 'Tis
true, when these Disorders came to be known to his
<PB N="178" REF="99"/>
Majesty, he expresly forbad any such ways of in∣slaving
the People for the future.</P>
<P>As for those few Slaves which the <HI>Indians</HI> have
voluntarily sold, tho the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have hitherto
made no question that they had a lawful right to
'em, they have had however reason enough to doubt
it, and they ought by no means to have taken
possession of 'em, till they had first us'd all necessa∣ry
diligence to get information whether they might
do it with a good Conscience; and if after all their
inquiry the matter remain'd dubious, they ought
not to have bought 'em while under that scruple:
So that all the ways they have taken to procure
themselves great numbers of Slaves are unlawful:
And when the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes saw how eagerly the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> pursu'd this trade, they would tyrannize
over their Subjects, and force 'em to become Slaves,
that they might be capable of answering the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
demands, and of buying the trifles they sold 'em.
The Judges of the Royal Council, who have sounded
this matter to the bottom, have declar'd, that scarce
any of the <HI>Indians</HI> have been lawfully inslav'd, and
on this account have set many of 'em at liberty.</P>
<P>The Missionary Monks who understood the Lan∣guage
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were acquainted with
their Secrets, have declar'd, that those who have
kept 'em as their Slaves, have done so without any
just ground: and they had no interest to speak after
this manner, being only concern'd about the Salva∣tion
of Souls.</P>
<P>And can it be thought that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were ig∣norant
of what themselves had done, who made
themselves formidable to the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and forc'd
'em by severe Punishment to procure 'em what
Slaves they requir'd? And these ignorant Infidels,
who have so little of the fear or love of God, might
easily perswade themselves that there was no In∣justice
<PB N="179" REF="99"/>
in doing what they saw Christians do before
'em; so that their ill Examples might well embolden
'em to steal away fatherless Children, to trepan the
ignorant, and even to make use of force and vio∣lence
to get Slaves to sell to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> For
after this manner have the <HI>Indians</HI> been corrupted
and induc'd to commit all kinds of Injustice against
their own Country-men to procure Slaves, since
they have had Conversation with the Christians,
who incouraged 'em in these Tricks, not only by
their Words, but likewise by their Example. And
'tis most certain, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not be igno∣rant
of these unrighteous Proceedings, since them∣selves
were the occasion and instruments of all this
Mischief: and it must at least be granted, that they
were oblig'd to suspect whether the Slaves that were
brought 'em were taken as lawful Prisoners of War,
and to inquire whether they might keep 'em with a
good Conscience or not.</P>
<P>They drove this trade with suspicious Persons,
and therefore might well have presum'd that they
offended the Rules of Justice; and that those that
gave or sold these Slaves to 'em, had no right so to
do. Men ought to be very cautious how they deal
with the <HI>Indians,</HI> lest they approve of the Theft and
other Crimes of these Infidels. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> knew
well enough what was commonly reported of the
<HI>Indians</HI> every where, that they us'd many unjust and
tyrannical ways to get Slaves on all sides; and there∣fore
ought to have scrupled the buying of 'em such
as were naturally free, and who had bin inslav'd
against the Law of Nations: So that they can ne∣ver
excuse themselves from possessing 'em unjustly,
and from participating of the Crimes of the <HI>Indians</HI>
in stealing and captivating great numbers of People.
Among a hundred thousand Slaves whom the <HI>Indians</HI>
have sold to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or paid 'em by way of
<PB N="180" REF="100"/>
Tribute, perhaps not one of 'em was properly a
Slave, or taken in a just and lawful War. But al∣lowing
some of 'em to be so, how could they be dis∣tinguish'd
from the rest in this vast number? Besides,
that there is a great difference, as we have already
observ'd, between the Slaves of the <HI>Indians</HI> and
those of the <HI>Europeans:</HI> The former make Slavery
not very uneasy or troublesom, their Slaves being
in a manner free, and not much differing from their
Children; whereas Slavery among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is a
most terrible condition, and those that are subjected
to it, enjoy no Favor, Comfort or Rest, but are con∣tinually
expos'd to Hunger and Thirst, and other
severe Punishments: Nor are there any Laws or
Statutes that can soften the cruel Temper of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and hinder 'em from exacting of their
Slaves such Service as surpasses human Strength.</P>
<P>From all the Principles we have been establishing,
it follows, First, that his Majesty is oblig'd by the
Law of God to set all those <HI>Indians</HI> at liberty,
whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made their Slaves, and
unjustly retain as such. First, Because his Majesty
is oblig'd to do Justice to all the World, to great
and small, without respect of Persons, without de∣spising
the Cause of the miserable and afflicted, who
are not in a condition to defend themselves, or re∣dress
their own Grievances. 'Tis the principal du∣ty
of Kings to execute Justice, and protect the
weak against the oppression of the strong; and
when they fail in this, they sometimes draw down
the Divine Vengeance on their own Persons and
Kingdoms; because the Cries of the poor, and such
as labor under Misery, incessantly go up to the
Throne of God. And since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> unjustly
oppress the <HI>Indians,</HI> who have no way to secure
themselves from the Violence and Tyranny of their
Persecutors; 'tis evident his Majesty is oblig'd to
<PB N="181" REF="100"/>
stop the course of their Injustice, and to restore
those poor People their Liberty who groan under
so cruel a Bondage. Nor ought this to be one mo∣ment
deferr'd, seeing these Vexations are publick
and notorious, and his Majesty cannot be ignorant
of 'em.</P>
<P>Those Kings that are willing to observe the strict
Rules of Justice, whether Pagans or Christians, ought
to use their utmost Efforts to keep their Subjects in
peace, tho at the same time they should forget no∣thing
that may conduce to lead 'em in the way of
Virtue; because the end that every Governor of a
Commonwealth ought to propose to himself is, to
act so as to render all his Subjects virtuous. How
much more are Catholic Princes, who profess to
follow the Rules of Christ, oblig'd to govern their
Subjects according to his Precepts, and to remove
all the Obstacles that are likely to turn 'em out of
the way of Truth? In which Enterprize they cannot
succeed without giving 'em good and equal Laws,
and obliging 'em to an exact observance of 'em.</P>
<P>Christian Princes are moreover bound to exhort
their Subjects to serve the true God, and to yield
obedience to the Doctrin of Christ, as much as
possibly they can. And seeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by un∣justly
retaining the <HI>Indians</HI> in slavery, are continually
in the habit of a mortal Sin, and consequently don't
live according to the Laws of Christ, our Kings
ought to command 'em to release all the <HI>Indians,</HI>
that they may remove this great Obstacle which lies
in the way of their Subjects Salvation. The Royal
Character of Princes obliges 'em to make Laws and
Regulations, that Justice may be maintain'd, and
the People subject to their Government preserv'd
in the practice of Virtue; and are likewise requir'd
by the Divine Law to employ their temporal Power
for the augmentation of the Catholic Church, and
<PB N="182" REF="101"/>
the maintenance of Ecclesiastical Disciplin, that the
Professors of Christianity may not rebel against the
Ministers of Christ. In this they may lawfully em∣ploy
the terror of their Arms, to keep all People
to their Duty; for otherwise Temporal Powers
would not be necessary for the administration of the
Affairs of the Church. From hence it may fairly
be concluded, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> ought to use
his power to render Justice to the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who
are so tyrannically oppress'd, and to strengthen the
hands of the Ministers of the Church in the <HI>Indies</HI>
by his Authority, who are not able to make any
progress by their Ministry among the Natives, nor
to reclaim the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their Vices, while they
are suffer'd to afflict and persecute the poor <HI>Indians,</HI>
because these continual Violences, and their fix'd
resolution to persist in 'em, are habitual Sins. At
present they regard not at all the Remonstrances and
Menaces of Prelats, or Ecclesiastical Censures, but
go on adding Sin to Sin, in so much that the Church
in the <HI>Indies</HI> is in a forlorn condition, and under
great difficulties: so that the <HI>Indians</HI> ought to be set
free, that the Obstructions lying in the way of their
Salvation may be remov'd, and that they may the
better be engag'd to submit to the Doctrin that is
preach'd to 'em: For by this means Christian
Pastors will have a full liberty to exercise their Mi∣nistry,
and to discharge their Apostolic Functions.</P>
<P>The Bishops of <HI>America</HI> are oblig'd by the Law
of God continually to sollicit his Majesty and his
Royal Council to deliver the <HI>Indians</HI> from the Op∣pression
under which they groan, and to give 'em
their former Liberty, because these Bishops are ne∣cessarily
engag'd by their Character to do the best
they can for the discharge of their Pastoral Office,
which consists in governing and teaching the People
under their Conduct, and in providing for all their
<PB N="183" REF="101"/>
spiritual necessities; as also in securing 'em as well as
they can from any temporal Injury, and in rescuing
'em from the hands of Oppressors, especially when
the Vexations they suffer are so many stumbling
blocks in the way of their Salvation. Nor ought
they to be wanting in procuring 'em all the tempo∣ral
Advantages they can.</P>
<P>The Dominican and Franciscan Friers are very pi∣ous
and prudent, and deserve to be highly commend∣ed,
in that they have agreed to refuse absolution to
all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>New Spain,</HI> who keep <HI>Indian</HI>
Slaves, and to oblige 'em to bring this affair under
examination before the Royal Council, in con∣formity
to the Laws newly made; tho they would
have done better not to have had recourse to this
Tribunal. These Monks know very well by experi∣ence
what unjust and deceitful Methods have been
us'd to inslave the <HI>Indians,</HI> and can't doubt but God
has been highly offended by these Violences, and
that those who have committed 'em are oblig'd to
repair the Injuries of which they have been guilty.
A Confessor who undertakes to hear Mens Confessi∣ons,
one who officiates in quality of a Bishop or
Curat as a spiritual Judg, ought to understand the
Obligations of his Ministry, and to have that know∣ledg
and prudence which is requisite to perform it
after a becoming manner, that he may pass a wise
and just Judgment on all matters propos'd to him,
and rightly discern what wrong is offer'd to any op∣pressed
Party. If his ignorance or negligence is the
cause of his Mistake, so that he obliges not his Pe∣nitent
to restore any ill-gotten goods, he commits a
great Sin, and is himself bound to make restituti∣on
and amends for the Injustice done the offended
Party: Just as a Physician who has through igno∣rance
done some considerable Mischief to his Pa∣tient,
or occasion'd his death, ought to make some
<PB N="184" REF="102"/>
special Reparation for his fault. The same may
be said of Judges that pass an unrighteous Sen∣tence,
while they are ignorant of the Law, or take
no care to inform themselves of the merit of the
Cause before 'em, because such neglect and igno∣rance
are criminal, and they ought to know the
matters on which they are intrusted to pass a Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>'Tis certain all the Ecclesiastical Persons in <HI>New
Spain</HI> are well assur'd that the <HI>Indians</HI> have been in∣slav'd,
and are still kept in bondage, contrary to all
Law and Equity; and therefore are not oblig'd to
refer the Examination of this Affair to the Royal
Council: besides, there are all sorts of tricks and
devices used to divert the Council from taking cog∣nizance
of the matter, lest they should suppress those
vexatious Practices. His Majesty ought with all
speed to issue out his Orders for the release of these
miserable People, and so much the rather, because
the oppression they are under is the occasion of the
ruin of an infinit number of Souls. And this is the
only way to reclaim the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the habit of
a mortal Sin, and to put the Prelats in a conditi∣on
freely to acquit themselves of their Ecclesiastical
Functions.</P>
<P>Among all the Expedients Frier <HI>Don Bartholomew
de Las-Casas,</HI> Bishop of the Royal City of <HI>Chiapa,</HI>
propos'd for the reestablishment of Peace and Tran∣quillity
in <HI>America,</HI> the most effectual was that of
directly subjecting all the <HI>West-Indies</HI> to the Crown
of <HI>Spain,</HI> that so the Spanish Lords might be uncapa∣ble
of making the <HI>Indians</HI> their own Subjects and
Vassals. And he supported this Proposal with many
very cogent Reasons.</P>
<P>First he says, the Princes and People of the New
World being Infidels, and their Conversion to our
<PB N="185" REF="102"/>
holy Faith appearing necessary, 'tis very proper
they should be under the Protection of a Catholic
and powerful King, who has a true zeal for the ho∣nor
and propagation of the Christian Religion, and
might send able Missionaries into the New World,
to bring those Idolaters to the knowledg of the true
God, and to embrace our Divine Religion, and sub∣mit
themselves to the Holy See. And hence it ap∣pears
that nothing can be more advantageous to the
<HI>Indians,</HI> than to put themselves under the protecti∣on
of Catholic Princes, that no particular Lords
may be capable of taking possession of 'em as their
Property. This is what the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> ought
to regard, without sharing with any others that Pow∣er
and Authority they have acquired over the <HI>In∣dians;</HI>
for they ought to preserve this Jurisdiction
immediately to themselves, and not divide it to in∣vest
private Men with it. And this is an Affair of
so great consequence, that no less than both the
temporal and eternal Welfare of those Nations de∣pend
on it; for the Conversion of the New World
would be a very advantageous thing to the Com∣monwealth.</P>
<P>'Tis neither just nor possible to abandon this Juris∣diction
to private Persons, since none but the King
can be invested with it; because when the Pope has
once made choice of any Person or Power for this Af∣fair,
it ought not to be delegated or entrusted to ano∣ther.
When he has in this matter declar'd himself
in favor of any Person illustrious by his Character
and Merit, who has a perfect knowledg of any Cause
he may have to determin, 'tis to be presum'd he'l
pass such a Judgment as the Pope himself would
have done. Now 'tis manifest that in the Case in
question we have a Person cloth'd with Grandeur and
Dignity, seeing he is King of <HI>Spain,</HI> a very good
Christian, and zealous for the Catholic Religion;
<PB N="186" REF="103"/>
and the matter is of great importance, because it
concerns the preaching and propagation of the true
Faith and Worship of God, the Conversion of nume∣rous
Nations, and the Government of 'em; which
is to be administred with Lenity and Prudence,
that Justice may be maintain'd among 'em, and the
love of Virtue inspir'd into 'em: which is an Em∣ploy
too great for any but Soveraign Princes to
perform.</P>
<P>'Tis certain the Holy See has chosen the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> to be entrusted with the Government of the <HI>In∣dies;</HI>
which may be prov'd by two considerable Cir∣cumstances.
The first of which is the Clause added
in the Commission, <HI>We rely upon your Fidelity, Prudence
and Justice:</HI> which is inserted in the Bull of Grant
and Commission of the <HI>Indies</HI> to the most serene Kings
of <HI>Spain,</HI> wherein the Pope says in express Terms;</P>
<P><Q>Knowing you to be Kings truly Catholic, as we
have been assur'd by many experiences, and that
your Piety is every where regarded throughout the
Christian World, we doubt not but you will use
all the care and diligence you can for the Exaltati∣on
and Increase of the Catholic Faith; as you have
spar'd no charge or pains to rescue the Kingdom
of <HI>Grenada</HI> from the hands of <HI>Sarazens</HI> and Infidels,
which has so much conduc'd to the Glory of the
name of God.</Q></P>
<P>The second Circumstance is, that when any ex∣press
Order is added in the Commission, the first
Clause of it is express'd in these Words:</P>
<P><Q>We exhort you by your Holy Baptism, which
obliges you to submit to our Apostolic Orders;
and we conjure you by the Bowels of Compassion
in Jesus Christ, that you would generously under∣take
this Expedition, to engage the People of the
New World to embrace the Christian Religion:
nor let any Hardships or Perils discourage you, but
<PB N="187" REF="103"/>
put your trust in God, who will make your Work
succeed to his Glory.</Q></P>
<P>The other Clause contains a kind of Command,
and is thus express'd;</P>
<P><Q>We command you in virtue of the holy Obe∣dience
you owe us; and we doubt not but you
will undertake this Affair with a great deal of
zeal and fervor, and send into the Islands and
Continent Men fearing God, able, experienc'd,
and capable of instructing the Inhabitants of the
New World in the Catholic Faith, and of inspir∣ing
'em with the love of Virtue.</Q></P>
<P>These Circumstances make it sufficiently appear,
that the Pope gave the charge of causing the <HI>Indians</HI>
to be instructed to the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> in conside∣ration
of the signal Services render'd the Church by
that Crown; nay, that he has oblig'd them to un∣dertake
this good work by his express Command to
apply themselves to it, in virtue of the holy Obe∣dience
they owe him.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this these Princes solemnly engag'd
themselves to second the Pope's designs with all their
Power: Their Promise was turn'd into a Covenant,
and became a formal Obligation on 'em; and con∣sequently
'tis the indispensible Duty of the Kings of
<HI>Spain</HI> to be the Ministers of the Holy See in carry∣ing
the Word of God into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and contribut∣ing
all their Power to continue the work of convert∣ing
the <HI>Indians:</HI> Their care should be extended to
their temporal as well as spiritual Concerns; and
they ought to neglect nothing that may be necessary
for their preservation or conversion. Nor is it law∣ful
for these Princes to abdicate this Authority, and
divest themselves of this Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Let your Majesty therefore please to consider se∣riously
how strict and indispensible this Obligation
is; be pleas'd to remember that in the year 1499,
<PB N="188" REF="104"/>
when <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> the first Discoverer and
Admiral of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> had permitted each
<HI>Spaniard</HI> that accompanied him to take one <HI>Indians</HI> in
recompence of the great Services done the Crown
of <HI>Spain</HI> in that Voyage, when those <HI>Indians</HI> arriv'd
in <HI>Spain,</HI> your Majesty so much resented it, that
'twas not easy to appease your Anger on that occa∣sion.
Your Majesty ask'd if the Admiral had power
to destroy your Subjects; and commanded the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
to send back to the <HI>Indies</HI> all the <HI>Indians</HI> they
had brought from thence on pain of Death. Ac∣cordingly
they return'd in the year 1500, when
<HI>Francis Bobadilla</HI> went to take the Government of the
New World.</P>
<P>The second reason that proves your Majesty under
an obligation to incorporate the <HI>Indies</HI> into the In∣heritance
of your Crown, and not to suffer the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in the least to usurp any thing in quality of
Lords and Masters, is, that otherwise 'tis impossible
the People should ever be brought to espouse Chri∣stianity.
To comprehend the force of this Reason
it must be remember'd that the Design of your Maje∣sty's
Title to possess these newly-discover'd Nations,
is no other than the publication of the Gospel, to
spread the knowledg of Jesus Christ among 'em;
and consequently your Majesty is oblig'd to remove
all Impediments that oppose this end, by establish∣ing
good Laws and Orders, and using all other just
ways and means to render this design prosperous.
The End is always the great Spring that should give
motion and direction to our Actions; and 'tis this
we ought to have principally in view, that we may
the better foresee what Obstructions are likely to
lie in our way, and take the most sutable measures
to attain the end propos'd. Now 'tis certain, that
the Power usurp'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over the <HI>Indians</HI>
is one of the greatest hindrances to the preaching of
<PB N="189" REF="104"/>
the Gospel among 'em for their Conversion. All
the World knows their excessive Avarice makes 'em
unwilling to suffer the Missionary Monks to preach
the Gospel to the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom those Tyrants look
upon as their Vassals; because the publication of the
Gospel (they say) occasions a considerable damage
to 'em two ways. First, because these Monks make
the <HI>Indians</HI> lose too much time in hearing their In∣structions;
these People (say they) are naturally
lazy and negligent, so that when they are diverted
from their Work, 'tis hard to bring 'em to it again.
It has often happen'd when the Monks had got the
<HI>Indians</HI> together in their Church to instruct 'em, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have come upon 'em, and taken away a
hundred or two by force, beating 'em cruelly to the
scandal of the rest, in spite of what the poor Monks
could say or do. And such Violences can't but ex∣tremely
impede the Salvation of the <HI>Indians.</HI> Another
Disadvantage the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to receive from
the Conversion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> is, that when they are
once instructed in the Maxims of Christianity, they
grow proud and untractable, and not so capable to
serve 'em: and is not this an open Confession that
their private Interest is dearer to 'em than the Sal∣vation
of these Peoples Souls? The frame of their
mind is an habitual mortal Sin against Charity, the
Order of which they pervert, not only in not pro∣moting
their Salvation themselves, which they ought
every day to do, being oblig'd in Conscience either
to instruct 'em, or procure others to do so; but
also in that they are so far from acquitting them∣selves
of this duty, that with all their might they
hinder others from informing 'em, without being
afraid of the Judgments of that God, who will one
day severely punish 'em for want of Charity to their
Neighbours, in witholding light from 'em, tho
<PB N="190" REF="105"/>
they have so much need of Information. They
hinder the pious Missionaries from coming to preach
to 'em, lest they should become acquainted with their
Vexations and Cruelties, which are so great and
strange, that the Monks are seiz'd with horror when
the <HI>Indians</HI> relate 'em. And when they see with their
own Eyes how miserably the <HI>Indians</HI> are treated,
they make it their business (as they are bound in
duty to God) to oppose these Disorders. They
sometimes advertise the Judges of those Tribunals
your Majesty has established there of these things,
to seek to redress 'em that way; tho the means hi∣therto
used have had very little effect; because
the Governors and Judges having a great many <HI>In∣dians</HI>
themselves, to whom they are unmerciful and
cruel, abuse their Power in oppressing these poor
Creatures, causing 'em to be punish'd rigorously for
the slightest faults. This is the true reason why the
Monks are look'd upon as so many troublesom Spies,
and the Enemies of their temporal Interest; so
that they can't endure so much as to see 'em, nor
would they willingly tolerate 'em in the Country,
but often curse 'em, and invent all sorts of Calum∣nies
against 'em. The poor <HI>Indians</HI> almost despair
to see any end of their Miseries; and having nothing
to trust to but the Zeal and Charity of the Monks,
do love and reverence 'em as their Deliverers and
Protectors, still putting great Confidence in them
under all their troubles; they often come in Bodies
out of their Towns and Cities to meet 'em: But 'tis
a great mortification to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to see the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
pay these good Men so much respect; and
they take occasion from hence to reproach 'em,
pretending the Monks design to make themselves
the Lords and Masters of these poor Wretches. But
God only knows what Labors and Hardships these
<PB N="191" REF="105"/>
Missionaries undergo, and to what Extremity they
are often reduc'd by poverty and hunger; when
they undertake great Journeys with inexpressible
fatigue, in rough and troublesom ways, to assist the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and shew 'em the way of Salvation; and to
admonish the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of their enormous Sins, in
tormenting 'em so many ways, in robbing and mur∣dering
'em: all which Violences call for large resti∣tution,
if they expect to be sav'd. Covetousness
and Injustice reign more in the <HI>Indies,</HI> than in all the
World besides; tho the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no just right
nor power there, since they don't derive it of your
Majesty. The <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally timorous and
cowardly, or rather the ill Treatments and Cruel∣ties
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have terrified 'em to that de∣gree,
that consternation and dread are become na∣tural
to 'em, insomuch that they scarce remember
they are Men.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible for Men in their Condition to ap∣ply
themselves to hear the preaching of the Gospel,
that so they might become Christians, since the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> so strenuously oppose it; who ought there∣fore
to give up the Title they have usurp'd over
them, ever since they made a Conquest of 'em, as
they are wont to boast. They that have any Interest
in a Governor's favor, dispose of the Persons of
the <HI>Indians</HI> as their proper Goods, and divide 'em
among themselves, as if they were born absolute
Vassals. Two or three <HI>Spaniards</HI> will sometimes
appropriate to themselves a whole Nation of <HI>Indi∣ans.</HI>
It may be the Master of the Family falls to
the Lot of one, his Wife to another, and their
Children to a third. They are sent to the Mines
loaded like Horses, and forc'd to carry heavy Bur∣dens
a hundred or two hundred Leagues; this is
seen every day. To obviate these Disorders, it
<PB N="192" REF="106"/>
will not be sufficient that your Majesty demand your
Tributes, and threaten those with severe Punish∣ment
who shall presume to torment the <HI>Indians</HI> for
the future, or exact such Tasks of 'em as they are
not justly oblig'd to perform; for they'l still persist
in the same course.</P>
<P>As the severe Bondage of the <HI>Indians</HI> is a great
obstacle to their Conversion on the one hand, so on
the other is the course taken to disperse 'em at a
distance one from another, whereby 'tis almost im∣possible
to assemble a considerable number of 'em.
Both these ways prevent their being instructed in
our Religion, and put in the way of Salvation.
'Tis necessary in order to their being fed with the
Divine Word, that they live in Society, and be in
a condition to be easily assembled; and 'tis as ne∣cessary
they should enjoy an entire Liberty, that
they might voluntarily embrace the Word of God.
The Learned say there was no System of written
Laws given by God in the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> because
the Church was his Family, and did not consist of any
whole Nation. Nor did God see good to give his
Law to the <HI>Israelites</HI> while in <HI>Egypt,</HI> tho they were
then a numerous People, and computed to be no less
than six hundred thousand Men able to bear Arms,
because they were not a free People, being yet in
Captivity. But the Almighty gave 'em his Law
when these two conditions were found in 'em to∣gether,
namely, when they were both Numerous and
Free; which was not till he had employ'd his Power
to deliver 'em from the Yoke of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But of
all Laws, that of the Gospel especially requires
both these Conditions, because it supposes Persons
at liberty to seek to be instructed in it, and to put
the Precepts of it in practise. And 'tis very pro∣per
for those that observe the Laws of Christ to
<PB N="193" REF="106"/>
incorporate themselves and live in Societies, that
they may perform the solemn Acts of Divine Wor∣ship
by the practice of the seven Sacraments and
other Ceremonies of the Church. 'Tis necessary
for Christians to meet together from time to time
in public to hear the Word of God, and assist at
other parts of his Worship, that so new Converts
may be confirm'd in the manner of Life they have
embrac'd; for without these helps they would in∣sensibly
decline in their Zeal, and might come even
to lose their Faith. In short, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
permitted to keep the <HI>Indians</HI> scatter'd up and down
on the Mountains, and in the Vallies, and to employ
'em perpetually in performing the unreasonable
Tasks they exact of 'em, it will be impossible to
instruct 'em in our Religion to any purpose.</P>
<P>By what has been said, your Majesty may very well
conceive what Disorders reign in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
how necessary 'tis to hinder the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from re∣taining
the Natives under so severe a Yoke, and
from proceeding to depopulate the Country as they
have hitherto done. And that which is yet more
deplorable, is, that they suffer 'em to die without
taking care to have the Sacraments administer'd to
'em, having no more regard for 'em than for Dogs
or Horses. One would think they believ'd these
People to have no immortal Souls, but were uncapa∣ble
of Rewards or Punishments in the other Life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are no way qualified either to be
Lords and Masters of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or to teach 'em
the Doctrin of the Gospel, or to induce 'em to im∣brace
it by their Examples. A considerable num∣ber
of <HI>Indians</HI> were committed to the care of <HI>John
Colmenero</HI> to be instructed in our Religion, tho he
was so ignorant that he knew not well how to make
the sign of the Cross, or give any tolerable account
of his own Faith; in so much that when he was ask'd
<PB N="194" REF="107"/>
what he taught those <HI>Indians</HI> under his Conduct, he
could make no other Answer than that he taught
'em to make the sign of the Cross, but pronounc'd
the words wrong that are us'd in that Ceremony.
When the <HI>Indians</HI> of one Province had brought all
their Idols to the Missionaries, with Protestations that
they now detested that impious Worship, and were
resolv'd to serve the true God for time to come,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sold these very Idols to other <HI>Indians,</HI>
or exchang'd 'em for Slaves. What concern of Mind
can the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be suppos'd to have for the Salva∣tion
of these People, when they only design to en∣rich
themselves, and thereby to be qualified for Em∣ployments
above their Rank; and when they are
so ignorant, that they don't know the Creed, or ten
Commandments? They are sordidly covetous, and
indeed give themselves up to all sorts of Vices; so
that their Lives are infamous and abominable. The
<HI>Indians</HI> are comparatively more honest and virtuous
than they are: for tho they are Pagans and Idola∣ters,
yet are content with one Wife, as Nature
teaches 'em, while they see Christians take fourteen
or fifteen Women, how expresly soever the Law
they profess forbids it. Many of the <HI>Indians</HI> scarce
know what it is to rob one another, to offer Vio∣lence
to any one, or to commit Murder: Whereas
they see the Christians guilty of all these, against
all Reasons and Justice, and that they violate all their
Oaths, so that there is no ground to put the least
confidence in 'em. The poor <HI>Indians</HI> that are Wit∣nesses
of the Crimes of such as call themselves
Christians, think the God they worship is the vilest
and most unjust God in the world, because he does
not immediately inflict some signal Punishment on
those that pretend to serve him, for their flagitious
Lives. They also think your Majesty the most cruel
of all Princes, because your Subjects are so abomi∣nably
<PB N="195" REF="107"/>
vicious; they fancy (as I have before said)
that your Majesty drinks human Blood, and eats
the Flesh of Men. And tho these things may ap∣pear
strange and surprizing to your Majesty, they
are no news to us who have been accustom'd to 'em.
And we can't but wonder, that some extraordinary
marks of the Divine Anger and Indignation have
not been inflicted on <HI>Spain</HI> to make her smart for
the Crimes committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI></P>
<P>Your Majesty may by this time very well perceive
the Character of those Men to whom the charge and
care of the Souls of the <HI>Indians</HI> is committed. And
'tis no wonder that there's so little done either for
their temporal or spiritual Advantage, since the dis∣covery
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> under such Conduct. God is
no more known there now than he was before, un∣less
it be in the Province of <HI>Mexico.</HI> And that
slight Instruction the People have had there has cost
'em very dear: Tho the Son of God commanded
his Disciples to give that freely which they had
freely receiv'd. The <HI>Indians</HI> were committed to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on condition they would undertake to
teach 'em the Christian Religion: therefore since
they have acquitted themselves so ill of that Com∣mission,
they ought to make restitution of all they
have taken from 'em under this pretext. However,
God will not be mocked, who sees all things, and is
a witness of all the wicked Actions of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who have made it their business only to torment
and inslave these poor People instead of taking
care to inform 'em of the Truth. And indeed
these secular Men are not very proper to be made
Preachers of the Gospel. Your Majesty has been
ill serv'd in not having had good Information given
you of the ill deportment of your Subjects. For
'tis not to be doubted but your Majesty would
<PB N="196" REF="108"/>
have provided a Remedy, if due care had been
taken to give you advice of it: Or if your Majesty
had not done it, you would have very much wrong'd
your Conscience in sending such Men into the new
World to preach the Faith, and give testimony to
the Doctrin of Jesus Christ, who are absolutely un∣capable
of so honourable a Ministry, and even de∣cry
and debase it by their scandalous Conversation.
'Tis therefore necessary that this Employment be
taken away from Secular, and committed to Reli∣gious
Persons, as agreeing better with their Cha∣racter,
which may be done without giving these
Ecclesiastical Ministers any occasion to claim a tem∣poral
Jurisdiction over the <HI>Indians;</HI> for if that
should be allow'd, we should fall into the same In∣conveniences
we are endeavouring to avoid. The
corrupt Lives and evil Examples of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
do more hurt than the preaching of an infinit
number of Priests and Monks can do good. There∣fore
your Majesty is oblig'd in Conscience to de∣prive
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the power they usurp over
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and never suffer 'em to make 'em their
Vassals.</P>
<P>One principal Reason that proves this Proposi∣tion
is, that People ought to enjoy Peace and Tran∣quillity,
that they may be in a condition to at∣tend
the Worship of God, and the good Works
prescrib'd by the Christian Religion, and not to be
diverted from the Sacraments by being condemn'd
to continual Labor. Which state of Peace and
Rest can't subsist without preserving to every Man
his Property, and guarding him from all the assaults
of Injury and Injustice. The Governors of Com∣monwealths
are bound by the Law of God to re∣move
out of the way all Obstructions to so necessary
a Peace, and speedily to allay those Dissensions and
Troubles that may continue Discord among such as
<PB N="197" REF="108"/>
profess Christianity, because 'tis directly opposit to
the end of God in creating Men; for he sends 'em
into the World to observe his Commands, and to
apply themselves to the exercise of Religion and
good Works, that they may thereby merit eternal
Life. This good order is necessary in every Christi∣an
Republic, but there especially where the Christian
Faith has been but lately entertain'd. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
are too covetous and self-interested to have any
Jurisdiction over the <HI>Indians</HI> granted 'em, because
they'l never give 'em any respit or repose, but go
on to rob and torment 'em all the ways they can in∣vent.
There is no kind of Injustice but they com∣mit
it to spoil these poor People, and therefore
there is no way to shelter 'em from their Oppres∣sions,
but by annexing the <HI>Indies</HI> to the proper In∣heritance
of your Majesty's Crown. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
kill the <HI>Indians</HI> with impunity in the Fields, in the
High-ways, and in the Mines, and do it more bold∣ly,
because many times there are no Witnesses pre∣sent
to convict 'em of their Cruelties. So that no∣thing
can be more evident, than that the <HI>Indians</HI> are
not in a condition to compose their Minds to at∣tend
to the Divine Word, so as to be induc'd to
obey the Divine Commands, while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
their absolute Lords, who will continually harass
'em with endless Trouble and Persecution, which
will fill their minds with Anguish and Vexation, and
all kinds of Misery, nay with an aversion to your
Majesty, and a great hatred to our God, and to his
Law, which seems to 'em so severe, so heavy and
intolerable a Yoke. They can't but think your Ma∣jesty's
Government is tyrannical, as well as that the
God whom we adore is unjust and unmerciful; sup∣posing
him the Author of all the Violence they suffer
from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> because while they, on pretence
of preaching the Catholic Faith, bring so many
<PB N="198" REF="109"/>
terrible Calamities upon 'em, their God suffers this
without punishing their Injustice and Impiety after a
very remarkable manner. These unfortunate Peo∣ple
have no other Relief than what they find in
their Tears, which they pour forth day and night,
protesting their own Gods were more kind and fa∣vourable
than the God of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and saying
they enjoy'd a settl'd Peace, and all the Cove∣niences
of Life while they serv'd their own Gods,
whereas ever since they had been under the power
of the Christians, they had been expos'd to all man∣ner
of Abuses. This makes 'em abhor the Catholic
Faith, and by consequence puts those that preach
to 'em out of a condition to attain their end: So
that your Majesty is beyond all question oblig'd by
the Law of God to rescue the <HI>Indians</HI> from the Yoke
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to take 'em under your own
Protection.</P>
<P>I farther add, that the power your Majesty has
over the People of the New World, has been
granted you by the Grace of God and the Suffrage
of the Church, both for the temporal and eternal
Advantage of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which Privilege is a kind
of necessary means of their Salvation. So that the
Government of 'em belongs of right to none but
your Majesty, with the exclusion of all other Powers
whatsoever, unless they desire to frustrate all the
Advantages both spiritual and temporal, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> might hope to reap from the Conversation
of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Your Majesty's Character and
Jurisdiction over 'em engages you to remove all Ob∣stacles
that may hinder them from obtaining these
Advantages, and being sav'd through Faith by the
preaching of the Gospel. Your Majesty ought not
to suffer your Authority to become infamous and
odious, nor your Subjects to usurp a tyrannical
Power that will infallibly issue in the destruction of
<PB N="199" REF="109"/>
the <HI>Indians,</HI> if they must be Vassals to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who treat 'em so cruelly and inhumanly. When
we first arriv'd in the New World, we saw innu∣merable
multitudes of People inhabiting the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>New-Spain, Cuba, Jamaica,</HI> and the Isle
of <HI>St. John,</HI> which are now all desolate. The Pro∣vinces
and Kingdoms of the Continent are in a yet
more deplorable condition, tho once as well peo∣pled
as <HI>Toledo</HI> and <HI>Seville.</HI> There's scarce any place
in the World where Men and other Animals multi∣ply
so much as they do in the <HI>Indies,</HI> because the
Air of the Country being temperate, favours Ge∣neration.
But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have found out the
art of entirely depopulating large Countries fill'd
with infinit numbers of People, for they have un∣justly
massacred some to possess themselves of their
Gold and Silver, others they have destroy'd by ex∣cessive
Labors, or by forcing them to carry unrea∣sonable
Burdens in long Journies; in a word, they
have sacrific'd the poor <HI>Indians</HI> to enrich themselves.
We advance nothing but the very Truth, and all
that we have said does not express half of what we
have seen; nor will it be a difficult task to convince
them of falshood who dare maintain the contrary
before your Majesty. None but such as have shar'd
in the fruit of this Rapine and Cruelty, will oppose
the truth of such Facts as are known to all the
world. And 'twill be in vain to pretend that any
contagious Distemper has made a Country of 2500
leagues desolate, which before was very populous.</P>
<P>The manner of governing Kingdoms ought to be
conformable to the Law of God and Man, for the
good and profit of the People, who are to be de∣fended
and preserv'd from the Violence and Injustice
of those that are destitute of the fear of God, and
use a tyrannical Power, merely obtain'd by Usur∣pation,
for the ruin and destruction of those that are
<PB N="200" REF="110"/>
under 'em. Your Majesty may easily be inform'd
how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have abus'd the Power you grant∣ed
'em for the Conversion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in turning
it to afflict and destroy 'em with unexampled Cruel∣ty.
And that which makes the case yet more la∣mentable
is, that none of those who have been em∣ploy'd
in your Majesty's service have ever given you
advice of these great Disorders, tho so very preju∣dicial
to your Interest, besides the loss of an infi∣nite
number of Souls who have perish'd in the dark∣ness
of Paganism, out of which they might have
been easily reduc'd if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had in the least
been govern'd by the fear of God.</P>
<P>Your Majesty may please to remember that one
Article of the Will of the most Serene Queen <HI>Isa∣bella,</HI>
is express'd after this manner:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Item,</HI> Since the time wherein the Apostolic See
granted us the Isles and Containent of the Ocean, it
has always been our principal Intention to cause
the Light of the Gospel to shine on the People of
the New World, and to send Prelats and Monks
thither to convert and instruct 'em in the truth of
the Catholic Faith. Therefore I beseech my Lord
the King, and the Princess my Daughter, to labour
with all their might to render this Enterprize
successful, and to secure the <HI>Indians</HI> from receiving
any damage either in their Estates or Persons, but
on the contrary to take care they be treated with
all sorts of kindness; and that strict and speedy
Justice be executed upon any one that shall offer
'em the least Injury, and to keep exactly to the
terms of the Apostolic Brief dispatched for this
Grant.</Q> These are the express Words of that Il∣lustrious
Princess: And yet no sooner was she ex∣pir'd,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to abuse the <HI>Indians,</HI>
and to offer 'em all the Outrages of which we have
been speaking, and could give your Majesty a more
ample Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="110"/>
To all the foregoing Reasons it may be added,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are declar'd Enemies to the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI>
and design nothing but their destruction, and
to get possession of their Country; which is so un∣doubted
a truth, that 'tis altogether needless to
prove it. For he is properly a Man's declar'd Ene∣my,
who goes about to accuse him of some ca∣pital
Crime, that deserves death; who deprives him
of his Liberty and the greatest part of his Goods;
who makes a cruel War upon him and inslaves him;
who seeks all Occasions to kill him, and takes away
his Wife and Children to inslave 'em; who usurps
all the Goods of his Relations when they die, and
unjustly ravishes from him all that is dear to him.
Certainly such Violences as these are against the
Rights both of People and Princes; and 'tis suffici∣ent
to demonstrate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be the declared
Enemies of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they have done 'em all
the mischief which we have been relating. For
they have calumniated and accus'd 'em of the most
horrible and infamous Crimes that can be imagin'd,
meerly to get possession of their Estates, and strip
'em of all they had under this pretext; whereas the
practices they charge 'em with are purely imagi∣nary,
and such as have never been so much as heard
of in the great Islands of <HI>New Spain, Cuba, Jamaica,</HI>
and St. <HI>John,</HI> tho they have been all very populous;
for after the most exact Enquiries we were able to
to make, we could never find the least appea∣rance
of those abominable Sins, to which some few
<HI>Persians</HI> are addicted. The <HI>Indians</HI> of the Kingdom
of <HI>Yucatan</HI> know not what this unnatural Vice is.
Nor are there any great number of 'em that eat hu∣man
Flesh. They are farther accus'd of Idolatry;
but Men have no right to punish 'em for this Crime,
which ought to be left to the Judgment of God.
Our Ancestors were formerly Idolaters, as the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="111"/>
are now; and the whole Universe was pollu∣ted
with this Sin before the coming of Christ, and
before the Apostles had preach'd the Christian Faith.
For God dispers'd them up and down the World to
dissipate the darkness that was spread over the
Earth: and they did not employ violence and force
of Arms to punish Idolatry, or other Sins that were
the Consequences of Infidelity; they made use of
nothing but the good Examples of their Virtue and
Holiness, together with their Doctrin, which con∣tain'd
the Menaces and Promises of the Word of
God; and we ought to do that in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which
they did in other parts of the World. This was the
Course which Christ himself first took, and then
oblig'd his Apostles to follow his Example. The
Son of God came to seek and to save that which was
lost. Which of our Ancestors could have been sav'd
if they had been put to death for Crimes commit∣ted
in the time of their unbelief? the express Words
of the Gospel are contrary to this Method; for
Christ says to his Disciples, <HI>Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead
the third day; and that repentance and remission of Sins
should be preach'd in his Name among all Nations, be∣ginning
at</HI> Jerusalem: <HI>And ye are Witnesses of these
things,</HI> Luke 24. 46, 47, 48. which evidently proves
that the Gospel ought to be at first preach'd to Infi∣dels,
by declaring of Peace, and the remission of
Sins that are past, since Christ has given no power
or permission to men to punish 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have moreover presum'd to main∣tain
that the <HI>Indians</HI> were like brute Beasts, utterly
uncapable of disciplin, and unfit to receive the light
of Christianity. Your Majesty has good reason to
punish those that declare such notorious Falshoods:
For under this Colour they have obtain'd of your
Majesty a power to possess themselves of the <HI>Indies</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="111"/>
as their absolute Property, and to do the <HI>Indians</HI> what
mischief they please. Thus have they impos'd on
the Conscience of the most Catholic King; and ob∣tain'd
leave to carry away the Inhabitants of the
Islands and Countries that lie near <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and
have accordingly forc'd 'em out of their own Coun∣try
against all Law and Equity; so that an innume∣rable
multitude both of Men and Women that in∣habited
above fifty Islands, some bigger than the <HI>Ca∣naries,</HI>
have been destroy'd, insomuch that there are
but eleven Persons left. I have been an Eye-witness
of this desolation, as well as <HI>Peter de Lisle,</HI> who is a
man of honor and credit, and now a Monk of the
Order of <HI>St. Francis.</HI> He built a Brigantine, and
man'd it with Sea-men to make a review of those
once populous Islands; and they found in all that
vast Country but eleven People (as has been said)
tho they spent two years in making this Voyage.
'Tis impossible for me to express to your Majesty,
on the one hand, the great meekness, goodness of
temper, and sincerity of the People of the New
World, and on the other, what enormous Rava∣ges
and Cruelties the Christians have exercised up∣on
'em. Your Bowels would be mov'd with Com∣passion,
and your heart too much affected, if an ex∣act
description of all this were made you.</P>
<P>Cruel Wars have been rais'd in divers rich Pro∣vinces,
without any fair occasion, but only to gratify
the covetous humour of the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> At the same
time they flatter themselves that they have Authority
from your Majesty to employ force and violence to
inslave these People. And all the difference they make
between those <HI>Indians</HI> they look upon as their Sub∣jects,
and those whom they treat as Slaves, is, that
they sell the latter publicly, but use a little more for∣mality
about selling the former, by seeking pretences
to hide their Injustice. In the unjust Wars they have
<PB N="204" REF="112"/>
made with 'em, after having kill'd the Masters of Fa∣milies,
they have also murder'd their Wives and Chil∣dren,
and possess'd themselves of all they had. And
God is now pleas'd every day to shew us by his severe
Chastisements that he has been grievously offended
by these Robberies and Cruelties. The Welfare of
the <HI>Indians</HI> both as to Body and Soul is in the great∣est
danger; for if they must be subject to the abso∣lute
Power of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they'l utterly destroy
'em, without sparing any, so much as to propagate
their Race. If the Law of Nature forbids us to
commit a Pupil to the charge of one that is a mor∣tal
Enemy to him or his Parents, or has embezel'd
his Estate, or set him an ill Example; and yet he has
been given up to the care of a Person of this Cha∣racter;
the Judges would be oblig'd to rectify the
matter, by taking him from under his Conduct,
whatever security he offers to give for his fidelity.
'Tis much the same case with the <HI>Indians</HI> in respect of
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for these would have it believ'd that
they are the Guardians, Tutors, and Protectors of
the other: tho 'tis only a fraudulent pretence to en∣snare
'em. The <HI>Indians</HI> know well enough how to
govern themselves, without being beholden to Guar∣dians;
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are no way capable of in∣structing
'em in the things of Religion, which yet
is the main thing the <HI>Indians</HI> want, and the greatest
kindness that can be done 'em. And 'tis easy to see
what disposition the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have towards 'em, as
to their temporal advantage. So that 'tis most cer∣tain
they are their declar'd Enemies; since they have
strip'd 'em of all their Goods, offer'd all sorts of
abuses to their Persons, and taken away their Wives
and Children, whom they have condemn'd to perpe∣tual
Slavery; which course, together with the cruel
Wars made upon 'em, has almost quite unpeopled the
New World. How is it possible that men that lead
<PB N="205" REF="112"/>
such kind of Lives, should inspire the <HI>Indians</HI> with
the desire of embracing the Law of God, and the
love of Virtue, especially seeing they many ways
persecute the very Monks, who are so zealous for
the Reformation of these Idolaters? On the con∣trary,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> spare nothing that may debauch
'em, and expose 'em to all sorts of Vice by the evil
Patterns they set 'em: They teach 'em to swear and
blaspheme the holy Name of God, tho in reality the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> don't do it designedly, but only because
they hear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> use such Expressions. 'Tis
therefore plain that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ought not to have
any Jurisdiction over the <HI>Indians,</HI> if their advantage
either as to this Life or that to come be consider'd,
seeing they are the mortal Enemies of this People,
and think of nothing but how to destroy 'em. It
would therefore be a piece of great Injustice to
abandon 'em to such Men, when their Disposition
toward 'em is so well known; it being a mortal Sin
to expose one's Neighbor to evident danger of
losing his Life: And we doubt not but your Majesty
will be cautious of falling under the guilt of such a
Crime, and not give up the <HI>Indians</HI> to the fury of
the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>All just and reasonable Laws, and those Philoso∣phers
that have written on Morality are against
placing any Government in the hands of necessitous
and covetous Men, whose greatest end is to get rid
of their Poverty, and to deliver themselves from
that mean condition in which they live, and there∣fore
are ready to sacrifice all the obligations of
Duty to the desire they have of becoming rich.
And because this greedy Passion is continually in∣creasing,
and their Minds are wholly set on the ways
of heaping up Wealth, and filling their Chests, they
find no rest but in satisfying their Avarice. They
abhor Poverty as Nature does a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> and there∣fore
<PB N="206" REF="113"/>
have no other thoughts night or day but to
contrive means of amassing together as much Trea∣sure
as they can. Upon this account the Philosopher
determins that 'tis a dangerous thing to put Nations
or Provinces under the Government of such as are
covetous or needy, who are resolv'd to be rich at
any rate in the world. We are inform'd in Histo∣ry
that the <HI>Romans</HI> being about to send two Consuls
to govern <HI>Spain,</HI> one of whom was poor and the
other covetous; when this Affair was propos'd to
the Senat, <HI>Scipio Africanus</HI> gave his opinion that
neither of 'em was proper to make a Governor,
there being reason to fear that both would abuse
their Authority to feather their Nests out of the
public Stock; because such kind of Persons are like
Leeches in a Commonwealth, and make it their
principal care to gather something on every side,
and to devour the Substance of the People, making
themselves rich at their charge, because their
covetous Desires can never be satiated as long as
they remain in this World: Nay it must be ad∣ded,
that this Vice most commonly proves incura∣ble;
so that if Men greedy of Lucre get Authority
over any People, they will not fail to spoil and ruin
'em, because the Passion that animates 'em, keeps no
bounds or measures. No Laws nor Penalties with
which they can be menaced, will be strong enough
to restrain 'em, as long as they are invested with
Power; and the more successful any covetous Man
finds his Industry to be, the more earnestly does he
desire and pursue Riches, which he accounts the
supreme Good. The desire of being rich produces
much the same effect in the mind of a poor cove∣tous
Man, as the hope of Celestial Happiness would
in that of a good Man; for as this perfectly fills up
the Capacity of his Mind that ardently wishes for
it, so the Miser's Soul can desire nothing besides
<PB N="207" REF="113"/>
hoards of Treasure, wherein his Happiness consists,
because Money answers all things: For this is that
which capacitates Men to undertake the greatest
Enterprizes, and to obtain whatever they desire in
this World, the highest Employments, Honors and
Dignities, costly Habit, and the most delicious Dain∣ties;
this facilitates their commission of all sorts of
Crimes, gives 'em opportunity to be reveng'd on
their Enemies, to acquaint themselves with Persons
of great Quality, and to obtain their Favour and
Esteem. 'Tis on these accounts that the Men of the
world seek it with all their might, and expose them∣selves
to so many Fatigues and Perils, as well as per∣petrate
the greatest Villanies to procure it.</P>
<P>Now the possession of Riches can never satisfy
the Soul, so as to give it perfect content; for 'tis
perpetually craving what it does not yet possess.
Therefore the Worldling, who has chosen Mony
for his chief Good and last End, is indifferent as to
other things, but devotes himself entirely to this,
employing all his care and diligence to increase his
Bags; and his thirst of Gold grows more and more
violent, by how much the more his Estate swells,
according to the Philosopher's Maxim, that Motion
is by so much the more impetuous, by how much
the nearer it approaches its end.</P>
<P>Avarice is a more incurable Evil than Concupis∣cence,
because its Object, and the things it promises
attract the Hearts of Men with greater violence;
and the power of Mony is of a larger extent, be∣cause
it puts a Man in a condition to gratify his
Lust, whereas this on the other hand can't procure
him Riches. The love of Mony endures longer on
the Mind than the Appetite of sensual Pleasures,
how violent and impetuous soever they may be for
a time. Covetousness is always on the advance, and
seldom extinguish'd but with a Man's Life: For the
<PB N="208" REF="114"/>
more a Man's natural Infirmites increase, the more
the desire of heaping up Wealth fortifies it self; as
'tis observable in old Men, that the nearer they ap∣proach
their end, the more covetous they usually
grow; because as their Health and Strength gra∣dually
diminish, they think they have the more need
of the assistance of the things of this World.</P>
<P>These Reasons make it evident, that if any Ju∣risdiction
or Government be given to covetous Men,
they will not fail to oppress and vex those that are
subjected to them, that they may make themselves
rich at their costs; and that nothing will hinder 'em
from gratifying their Avarice whenever they have
a fair occasion; for this Vice is the root and spring
of all others, 'tis the source of Treason, Fraud,
Perjury, Violence, Rapine, and barbarous Cruelty.
This Passion is said to be blind, because it occasions
blindness in the Mind, and benights the Reason with
the grossest Darkness, and hinders him that is cap∣tivated
with it from perceiving his danger. The
sight of Gold, tho it causes the commission of all
manner of Crimes, and is the source of Calumnies,
gives him more Joy than the light of the Sun, be∣cause
he finds his Account in the ruin of others.
It excludes Fidelity, and banishes Union and Con∣cord
out of the World; it violates Charity, and
produces all manner of Mischief; it knows no Com∣passion,
but induces Men to disclaim their very Pa∣rents,
and break all the ties of Faith and Amity;
it never suffers a Man to sympathize with his Neigh∣bour's
Miseries, but even makes him disregard his
Relations as if utterly unacquainted with them.
The covetous Man never forgives himself his own
Expences, and leads a miserable Life in the midst of
Plenty and Wealth. This greedy humor so darkens
the Understandings of those that are bewitch'd by it,
that they know not how to make a right Judgment
<PB N="209" REF="114"/>
of any thing, but instead of following the Dictates
of reason, are on all occasions driven down the im∣petuous
Current of their beloved Vice, all their
Thoughts and Desires are directed this way, and
yet they can never quench the insatiable Thirst that
preys upon their Souls.</P>
<P>But I must now apply all these Reasons to the sub∣ject
in hand: and I beseech your Majesty to give
attention to the Consequences I draw from 'em.
All the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that leave their own Country to
go into the <HI>Indies</HI> are poor, and 'tis only Avarice
that drives them thither; for they don't only pre∣tend
to raise themselves a little above a condition of
Poverty and Want, but to amass vast Treasures to∣gether,
without setting any Limits to their unmea∣surable
Covetousness, that they may be able to buy
honorable Offices and Emploiments, and advance
themselves far above their degree. We have been
taught by experience that in a few years, many <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
who were in the meanest and basest condition,
and always led a miserable Life, have considerably
alter'd their fortune by the Riches they have brought
from the New World, and likewise introduc'd
great corruption of Manners throughout all <HI>Spain.</HI>
The love of Mony is now grown to that height,
that Gold and Silver seem the only Gods that are
worship'd. They that know not how to advance
themselves by industry and labor, do it by plundring
and robbing without any fear of punishment. They
take away from the poor <HI>Indians</HI> all they find in their
houses, and after all make 'em work to get still more
out of their sweat and labor; so that if any Autho∣rity
over the <HI>Indians</HI> be allow'd 'em, they'l certainly
abuse it to enrich themselves, while this detestable
covetousness reigns in their minds. And what can
the poor <HI>Indians</HI> do to shake off their tyrannical
Yoke, since they are naturally meek, quiet and timo∣rous,
<PB N="210" REF="115"/>
and dare not complain or murmur; or if they
should, have no body to hearken to 'em or defend
'em? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have an absolute Power,
are always chiding and domineering over 'em wher∣ever
they are, in the Fields, on the Mountains, in
the Mines, in the Desarts, or in the High-Ways.
They take all the furniture of their Houses from
'em, which is their greatest Riches, as well as ex∣pose
'em to the greatest dangers, and most intolera∣ble
Labours, beating and inflicting on 'em the se∣verest
Punishments for the least Trifle, when they
hope to get any thing by it. What a piece of In∣justice
then must it be to abandon such meek
and submissive Creatures to the fury of such men
as these, when they are in no capacity to resist the
tyranny of their Persecutors, but are made their
meer tools?</P>
<P>What would one say of that Judg, who after
he has received information of the violent passion of
a wild Spark in the heat of Youth, to a beautiful
Virgin, should notwithstanding order 'em to live to∣gether
in the same house, and give him an absolute
power over her, but withal threatning to punish
him severely if he offer'd her any violence? Could
any one safely confide in the Promises of such a man
as this, whatever Protestations he should make of
moderating his passion on so critical an occasion? It
is not to be doubted but such a Judg would commit
a mortal Sin, in thus exposing his Neighbour to so
dangerous a Temptation, tho he should happen to
abstain from the Sin to which he has so great a pro∣pension.
It almost amounts to the same thing to
put the <HI>Indians</HI> under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
who are their mortal Enemies; for if they
don't massacre 'em in cold blood meerly out of the
hatred they bear 'em, they do it however to get
their Goods, and rob 'em of their Treasure. And
<PB N="211" REF="115"/>
as in the former Instance it would be next to a Mi∣racle
for that amorous Youth not to abandon him∣self
to the Conduct of his Passion, when the Object
of it is committed to his disposal; so 'tis not to be
expected that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should abstain from com∣mitting
all sorts of Outrages on the <HI>Indians,</HI> and sa∣crificing
both their Estates and Lives to their own
Interest, since their Avarice irritates 'em with
greater violence (if possible) than Lust does the
other in the former case: so that Laws back'd with
Menaces and Punishments will make no impressions
on the minds of these men, but they'l be sure still to
exercise a thousand Cruelties on the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> if
no other course be taken to give check to their Co∣vetousness.</P>
<P>I entreat your Majesty to consider what befals any
Province to which you send a Governor. If he be
covetous, and regardless both of his Honor or Reli∣on,
what Disorders and Mischiefs does he not bring
with him? Tho he has not so absolute a Power as
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have over the <HI>Indians</HI> whom they keep
in their Houses; tho the Royal Council of <HI>Spain</HI>
think themselves concern'd to oppose his Prevarica∣tions;
and tho the King's Presence one would think
should be a strong Bridle to restrain his Exactions:
yet in two years time, such a Governor as we have
bin describing will become rich, by the Rapine and
Extortion he commits in the Province put under his
care. What then is it likely the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will do,
in the remotest parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> when they have
an unlimited Power over the <HI>Indians,</HI> and neither
stand in awe of God nor the King; and when these
poor People are under so great apprehension of
still more intolerable Cruelties, that they dare not
complain of the violence they suffer? And how
shall they report their Grievances? shall they go to
the Royal Council, which is it may be three or four
<PB N="212" REF="116"/>
hundred Leagues from 'em; or shall they address
themselves to your Royal Throne, which is distant
above three thousand? What course shall they take
to prove the Insults, Vexations and Persecutions
they endure from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in Countries so re∣mote,
where they can expect no relief?</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are so hardn'd by their excessive
Avarice, that they are not in the least touch'd with
the Groans and Complaints of these miserable Peo∣ple;
for nothing makes impression on their minds
but Gold and Silver. The Condition to which they
advance themselves in the <HI>Indies</HI> is so far above their
former state, that it inspires 'em with intolerable
Pride and Arrogancy. They pass away their time
in pleasure and feasting, and clothe themselves after
so sumptuous a manner, that nothing in the World
can be more magnificent. And withal it may well be
said that nothing can equal the corruption, licen∣tiousness
and dissoluteness of their Manners; and to
supply all these superfluous Expences and Excesses,
they suck out the very Blood of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI>
Now seeing there's no hope of obliging the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
to alter their Conduct, and both the Laws of
God, and right Reason, and all the Maxims of Poli∣cy
and Prudence oppose the giving of any Govern∣ment
into the hands of covetous and indigent Per∣sons,
who are prejudic'd with a violent desire of
gain: Much less ought your Majesty to suffer the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to usurp a Title to the <HI>Indians</HI> as their
Free-hold, when they are so greedy and insatiable,
that they'l make no difficulty to sacrifice all kinds of
duty to the desire they have of raking sums of Mo∣ny
together any way in the World. For all their
Industry will be employ'd in pillaging their Vassals;
and which is yet more to be lamented, while they
cruelly deprive 'em of temporal Life, they likewise
take a course to expose 'em to eternal Death.
<PB N="213" REF="116"/>
Therefore your Majesty ought to incorporate the
<HI>Indies</HI> with the Inheritance of your Crown, that you
may be the universal Father, Protector, Governor
and Lord of all the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>I add to all the foregoing Reasons, that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
impose intolerable Burdens on the <HI>Indians,</HI>
and exact such Services of 'em as reduce 'em to the
extremity of misery and despair. 'Tis their first
and principal duty to serve and obey their own na∣tural
Princes; because this is founded on the Law of
Nature. In the second place, they owe your Maje∣sty
service and obedience, as being their universal
Soveraign; which is an obligation of Divine Right,
founded on the Engagement your Majesty has con∣tracted
to send 'em the Light of the Gospel, and
to take care for their Instruction in the orthodox
Faith. The third kind of Service is that which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> oblige 'em to render them whether they
will or no, which is a severe and tyrannical Yoke, nay
more intolerable than what the Heathen Tyrants im∣pos'd
on the primitive Christians; it may be liken'd
to the torment the Devils inflict on the Damned in
Hell. The Violence of it is contrary to all the Laws
of Nature and Reasons, nor can it be justified by any
human Laws. It must be remembred that the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
are naturally weak, going always naked, and
continually expos'd to the heat of the Sun: 'tis there∣fore
contrary to all Justice that they should be op∣press'd
with heavy Burdens far above their strength,
as well as contrary to Charity, and the Custom of all
reasonable Men. All the service these poor Crea∣tures
do can't satisfy the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who therefore set
an Officer over 'em strictly to inspect their Actions,
and render their servitude still more terrible. This
Employ is usually bestow'd on some cruel and inexo∣rable
Monster, who always stands over 'em to make
'em work the harder, and punctually to obey all his
<PB N="214" REF="117"/>
Commands. The Executioners of the divine Wrath
in Hell can't be more wicked and hard-hearted than
this sort of Men: They brand 'em with hot Irons,
and are continually beating and abusing 'em; they
are not content to make 'em labor without inter∣mission,
and to set 'em unreasonable Tasks, but al∣ways
reproach and chide 'em while they undergo
this Toil, and besides all this, violate their Wives
and Daughters, or make Presents of many of 'em
together to their Masters on whom they depend,
and who set 'em to work as so many principal Ty∣rants,
who also make it their business to invent cruel
and unsufferable Torments. And to hinder the
<HI>Indians</HI> from complaining of their Miseries, they
threaten to inform against 'em, that they have seen
'em worship their Idols. This is the sad state to
which these People are reduc'd. They depend on
no less than four several Masters, on your Majesty,
their <HI>Caciques,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to whom they are in∣slav'd,
and his Deputy, who is the greatest Plague
to 'em that can be. Nay, 'tis impossible to tell how
many Masters they have, seeing all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do∣mineer
over 'em as so many Tyrants, robbing 'em
by turns, and making no scruple cruelly to abuse and
murder 'em.</P>
<P>Seeing the preaching of the Orthodox Faith is
the only thing that could warrant the reduction of
the <HI>Indians</HI> to a state of dependance on any foreign
Power, in order to their Conversion; and seeing
none can pretend on this account to be their lawful
Soveraign but your Majesty; it follows that your
Majesty ought with all your might to oppose the
Power which private Men assume over 'em, and
which can't be look'd upon as any better than Ty∣ranny.
Your Majesty is oblig'd for the common
good of all your Subjects to establish a regular and
stable form of Government among 'em, which may
<PB N="215" REF="117"/>
conduce to their Conversion and Salvation: and see∣ing
the soveraign and single Power you have over
'em is sufficient for the end propos'd, other Juris∣dictions
are not to be tolerated, because they can
only prove burdensom and incommodious, and con∣trary
to the common Maxims of Government re∣ceiv'd
in the World, which will not allow a People
to be subject to several different Princes; much
less should the <HI>Indians</HI> be thus subjected, because of
their Poverty, Meekness, Patience, Humility, and
the tenderness of their Constitution, partly occa∣sion'd
by their going naked, their unwholsom Food,
and the Labor they undergo to get their living.
After all this 'twould be sufficiently tedious and un∣easy
to 'em if no other Duties were exacted of 'em
than those which your Majesty and their <HI>Caciques,</HI>
who are their immediat Princes, impose. How then
can they be able to endure those excessive Tasks,
those heavy Blows, Vexations and Abuses of which
we have spoken above? If your Majesty has a mind
to preserve the <HI>Indians</HI> from utter Destruction, these
new Burdens ought not to be impos'd on 'em, nor
should they be condemn'd to this severe Slavery.
This would be to violate the Laws of Justice and
Charity: For the Masters of Policy and Prudence
usually say, that tho a Prince require extraordinary
assistance of his Subjects in some pressing Exigencies
of the Commonwealth; yet where these Subjects are
under other subordinate and immediate Lords, to
whom they are oblig'd to pay the same Duties, this
cannot be done, because this would be to over∣charge
'em with endless Taxes: for 'tis contrary to
all Justice to oppress 'em with a double Burden, and
all good Laws formally condemn it; for the Rules
of Equity forbid all Oppression and Injury. There∣fore
since the <HI>Indians</HI> are already bound to serve
their natural and immediate Princes, and to pay 'em
<PB N="216" REF="118"/>
all the homage and duty of Subjects, it would be un∣just
to subject 'em to such new Masters as pretend to
a right of exacting new Services of 'em. The
Taxes that are impos'd on any Estate should be pro∣portionate
to the Revenue that may be expected
from it; and there ought not to be more Homage
and Service annex'd to it than is reasonable for
the advantage of him that owns that Estate. If in∣animate
things have this privilege, how much more
ought it to be so with Men, who deserve to be
us'd a little better? Since therefore your Majesty's
Government alone is sufficient for the welfare and
advantage of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to set other Lords over
'em would be to act contrary to Justice. For who
can deny it to be contrary to all the Laws of Equity,
to subject the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who mind no∣thing
but to raise Estates by making a Prey of 'em?
An 'tis as opposit to Charity to add new Burdens to
them that can scarce bear such as are already im∣pos'd
upon 'em, and to increase the Calamities of
such as are sufficiently beset with Affliction, besides
the pains they take for the subsistence of their Wives
and Children▪ Charity teaches to do to others as
we would have them do to us, to secure 'em from
all the Evil we can, and to relieve 'em in their In∣digence
when they address themselves to us, and
shew us their Necessities, because we our selves are
desirous of the Assistance of others, when in distress.
The Laws of Christ are founded on such Maxims as
these: <HI>Do to others what you would have others do to
you;</HI> and, <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self;</HI>
in which one word, St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, the whole Law is
contain'd. He farther says, <HI>Bear ye one another's
Burdens, and so fulfil the Law of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be consider'd, that all the Inhabitants of
the New World are born free: Nor do they lose
this Liberty in recognizing your Majesty for their
<PB N="217" REF="118"/>
Soveraign, and universal Emperor of the <HI>Indies.</HI>
On the contrary, if there be any defects in their
Polity, your Majesty's Government may supply 'em,
by which their Liberty will be render'd the more
compleat. This was the design of that most Chris∣tian
Princess, Queen <HI>Isabella,</HI> as appears by all the
Writings she left about this Affair. A few days be∣fore
her Death she commanded General <HI>d' Alcantara,</HI>
then Governor of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> to treat all the <HI>Indians</HI>
as a free People. And in a general Assembly of
Divines and Lawyers held at <HI>Burgos,</HI> his Catholic
Majesty declar'd in Council, that the Inhabitants of
<HI>America</HI> were free, and commanded they should be
treated as such. The same was done by your Ma∣jesty,
after having consulted the most learned Di∣vines
and Canonists in the year 1523.</P>
<P>Now if it be an incontestable Principle that all
the <HI>Indians</HI> are free, and that all of 'em that have
been, or shall be discover'd in time to come, can't be
subjected to any other Jurisdiction but that of your
Majesty, and that they own to your Majesty alone
that Homage and Obedience which free Cities and
Nations are oblig'd to pay their lawful Soveraign,
'tis most evident that no private Men can pretend
to the same. Nay, they are more free in respect
of us than other Nations, because the Kings of
<HI>Spain</HI> have no Title to 'em as their Subjects by
right of Inheritance, or that of Purchase, or of
Conquest, as they might have had, if they had
been conquer'd in a lawful War, that had bin for∣mally
declar'd, for the revenge of some great
Offence which the <HI>Indians</HI> might have commited
against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or against the universal
Church, or some very considerable Member of it,
for which they had refus'd Satisfaction when de∣manded:
or if they had unjustly retain'd any Lands
or Goods of which they were unlawfully possess'd.
<PB N="218" REF="119"/>
But on the contrary, they have frankly and volun∣tarily
submitted themselves to your Majesty. And
yet they have bin hitherto not only neglected, but
treated by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as wild Beasts are by Hun∣ters,
tho they never did any thing to deserve such
ill usage. They have yet seen nothing to convince
'em of your Majesty's Grandure, Justice, Goodness,
and Magnificence, having found nothing but Ty∣ranny,
Violence, Injustice and Cruelty from the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> your Subjects, whose ill Actions and bad
Examples render 'em infamous; so that the <HI>Indians</HI>
look upon 'em as the vilest of Men. And this makes
'em think upon the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> with horror,
who yet never gave 'em occasion to entertain such
thoughts of 'em. But they fancy your Majesty per∣fectly
knows all the ill treatment they endure, and
that 'tis by your Consent and Approbation; they
believe 'tis all done by your order, and that you
give your Protection and Favour to those that insult
over 'em.</P>
<P>The Title your Majesty has to the <HI>Indians</HI> is
founded only on the Obligation you have taken
upon your self to have 'em instructed into the true
Faith, as appears by the Apostolic Briefs granted
on this account: which ought to engage your Ma∣jesty
to moderate your Government so much the
more, and to treat 'em with the greater tenderness
and kindness. The Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> should signalize
the First-fruits of their Soveraignty over the <HI>Indies,</HI>
by the tokens of Peace and Love to these People,
and by taking care to furnish 'em with good Ex∣amples:
In a word, they ought to treat 'em as their
Neighbors and natural Subjects, for fear the com∣mission
of any Injustice or Cruelty among 'em should
prejudice 'em against the Christian Faith, and in∣dispose
'em to receive the Counsils and Maxims of
our Religion. There should not be the least occa∣sion
<PB N="219" REF="119"/>
given 'em on any account to blaspheme the
Name of God, which would be an Obstacle to the
great end of their Conversion. Nothing should be
left undone, that may make 'em love your Majesty,
and induce 'em to praise God on finding them∣selves
under a Government so easy and commodious.
They deserve in some respect to be dealt with after
this manner, because of the freedom of their birth,
which makes it unjust for any to violate their Li∣berty.
'Tis necessary for the Honor of the Chris∣tian
Religion, that they embrace it voluntarily,
because God himself will have men make a free
choice in matters of Religion; nor is any man
whatsoever to be treated with violence in this case,
and forc'd to embrace a Religion against his Will.
And temporal Princes commit a great piece of in∣justice,
if they put a force on the minds of their
Subjects in a business wherein they ought to have an
entire liberty of Conscience: they should rather
observe the Rules which God, the Universal Sove∣raign
of all his Creatures, has constituted. There
is no Power or Authority on Earth that has a right
to violate the Liberty of any People, because 'tis
the most valuable thing they possess, and preferable
to all other things in the World. Hence it is there
are such advantageous Constitutions in the Civil
Law in favor of Liberty. And the particular Cus∣toms
of the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> prescribe that no∣thing
be determin'd in prejudice of a Man's Liberty
in doubtful things, nor the least force or constraint
put upon men that are free. And when their con∣sent
to any thing is violently extorted, it ought not
to be imputed to 'em, because 'tis an infringement
of the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>If 'tis unlawful to seize on the Goods of Men that
are free without cause, much more is it to offer
violence to their Persons, and to inslave 'em, which
<PB N="220" REF="120"/>
is the greatest Injury they can receive next to the
loss of Life it self. If a Father can't choose himself
another Heir without the consent of his Son, who
has a natural Title either to the whole, or at least
a 4<HI>th</HI> part of his Father's Estate; much less may
inferior Lords pretend to a right of appropriating
the Kings Subjects to themselves, unless his Majesty
consent by abandoning his own Right, which is found∣ed
on the voluntary Agreement of his Subjects. If
the current Mony of the Kingdom can't be alter'd
without the People's consent, because the alterati∣on
may be attended with great Inconveniences;
much less can the People themselves be taken from
the Dominion of the King against their Will, and
subjected to the absolute Power of private Masters;
because this forc'd Change is a Violation of their Li∣berty.
It must be farther added, that such as are
tributary to your Majesty, can't pass under the Juris∣diction
of another Person, which would be more
uneasy and disadvantageous to 'em, and under which
they would perhaps be condemn'd to a more servile
and laborious Course of life. How much more
ought they who enjoy an entire liberty under any
Prince's Government, to be preserv'd in the possession
of their Privileges; and how injurious would it be
to deliver 'em up as Vassals to particular Lords,
who would probably abuse their Authority, and
treat their Persons with violence, as well as greatly
prejudice 'em in their Estates? 'Tis most injurious
both to the Lives and Liberties of Men, to depend
on divers Lords and Masters, because their Service
and Labors multiply according to the number of
those under whose jurisdiction they are: And 'tis to
be presum'd they will not be all alike just and equita∣ble.</P>
<P>'Tis very much the Interest of Princes, not to suf∣fer
the number of their Subjects to be diminish'd,
<PB N="221" REF="120"/>
because it will deprive 'em of much of the advan∣tage
and service they may reasonably expect from
'em. And 'tis as much the Interest of Subjects, not
to suffer themselves to be transfer'd from the Do∣minion
of the Prince under which they have always
liv'd, to that of an inferior Master. Those that
know the difference between the Government of
Kings, and that of particular Lords, which is usual∣ly
hard and severe, will do any thing to be secure
from the latter; while they are well pleas'd with
the former, and readily dispose themselves to bear
a Yoke that appears so much easier and lighter
than the other. And this is the reason why the ge∣nerality
of Men do all they can to avoid falling un∣der
the dominion of private Men to the prejudice
of that Royal Jurisdiction to which they have been
continually accustom'd. And this Sentiment is jus∣tified
by the suffrage of all wise Men, and favor'd
by all just Laws.</P>
<P>'Tis a general Rule, that a Prince can do nothing
that may cause any considerable damage to his Sub∣jects,
unless they freely give their own consent:
And this your Majesty every day observes, where∣in
you follow the steps of your Ancestors, who to
avoid doing any thing contrary to the rules of Jus∣tice
and Equity, frequently us'd to assemble their
Council, and to take their advice who were Per∣sons
of great Wisdom and Sense, and to make a due
improvement of it. In the present affair, it would
be injurious to the <HI>Indians</HI> to give 'em up to the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
as their Vassals, because they use 'em so bar∣barously,
and reduce 'em to the utmost degree of
Servitude. And such a matter as this is not to be
concluded, without proposing it to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and
obtaining their consent. For thus to change their
condition without consulting 'em, were to put a
treacherous trick upon 'em against the Laws of Na∣ture,
<PB N="222" REF="121"/>
Justice and Charity, because this subjection
would be to a severe and tyrannical Power; as is
evident by what the <HI>Indians</HI> have hitherto met with
from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Beside, such an alteration would
be contrary to the Will and Law of God, because
it would hinder the progress of the Catholic Faith,
and inspire the <HI>Indians</HI> with hatred to the Gospel,
and would tend to the general destruction of those
People whom your Majesty is bound to preserve and
protect. This you owe 'em from a motive of Cha∣rity
and Zeal for the good of your Neighbor, as you
are a Christian Prince, and moreover by the Obli∣gation
of your Office, as the Vice-gerent of Jesus
Christ.</P>
<P>From all the Reasons alledg'd, it may well be con∣cluded,
that if even the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves would
voluntarily consent to be inslav'd, and utterly re∣nounce
their Liberty; yet this consent of theirs
would be void and null of it self, because a thing
every way so mischievous ought by no means to be
tolerated. Your Majesty would be oblig'd by the
Law of God to hinder 'em from ruining themselves
in such a manner; because the Tyranny the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
exercise over 'em is so great, that many of
the <HI>Indians</HI> have fallen into utter despair under their
unsufferable Impositions, and chosen rather to stab
or poison themselves than to pine away gradually
under their miserable Bondage: Others have fled
into the Mountains, where they have become a Prey
to Tigers and Lions; others have died merely with
Sorrow and Anguish, when they found they were
condemn'd to a Life so full of Misery and Toil,
without any hope of respit or mitigation. I knew
a <HI>Spaniards</HI> who was so famous for his Cruelty, that
above two hundred People kill'd themselves, some
one way and some another, to avoid his Barbarities
in <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> A like number underwent the same
<PB N="223" REF="121"/>
fate in the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where this Tyrant exercis'd
his Violence and Rapine.</P>
<P>But tho the common Interest of all Nations in
the World ought to prevent their Kings from alie∣nating
them from their own Dominion to make 'em
the Vassals and Subjects of private Men, and tho this
is founded on natural Reason and Justice; yet some∣times
in pressing Exigencies Princes may alienate a
part of their Territories to extricate themselves out
of some great and perplexing difficulty, from which
they cannot otherwise get free. For instance, if
they have no other course to take for the defence of
the Commonwealth, it seems lawful for 'em to ex∣change
the Jurisdiction they have over their Subjects,
provided they some way indemnify 'em, or repair
any damage this exchange may occasion. But 'twould
be impossible to indemnify the <HI>Indians</HI> if they should
be left to the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who bring
upon 'em inexpressible Calamities and Mischiefs, that
can never be repair'd by any advantage they may
allow 'em; for they take a course to destroy both
their Souls and Bodies. Therefore seeing the Con∣version
of the <HI>Indians</HI> depends principally on your
Majesty's Title and Jurisdiction over 'em, you ought
not to do any thing that may blast the hope of this
Design, and will infallibly hinder these People from
embracing Christianity. And it must be remem∣ber'd
they have freely and willingly chose your Ma∣jesty
for their Soveraign, which is a kind of Con∣tract
they have made with your Majesty, that can∣not
be violated without their Consent, unless it be
to put 'em in a condition more easy, advantageous
and secure, than what they enjoy under your Ma∣jesty's
Dominion. And your Majesty is oblig'd to
promise and swear to 'em, that you will always
preserve their Privileges, as they are ordinarily kept
in the generality of Kingdoms, when a free People
<PB N="224" REF="122"/>
submit themselves to the Government of a new
King. This Practice is almost as antient as the
World, for ever since Men began to spread them∣selves
upon the face of the Earth, it has always been
the custom of Princes to promise and swear to 'em to
employ all their Power in preserving and defending
'em from Oppression. Which evidently proves that
your Majesty has not power to give up the <HI>Indians</HI>
to the absolute Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
have had the cruelty to destroy such numerous Na∣tions
of 'em, without any legal Process, or leave to
make their Defence. For it would be to act contra∣ry
to the Law of God and Nature to expose 'em to
so many Miseries, which are as so many invincible
Obstructions to hinder 'em from turning Christians.
Nor is there any Prince on Earth, who can justly
pretend to have such a Power: for Soveraign
Princes have no Authority to do any thing that may
provoke the Justice of God, who has not set 'em
over their People for their ruin and destruction, or
for the overthrow of the Church; but on the con∣trary
has set 'em in the World to defend the Church,
to bring their People to espouse the true Faith, and
edify 'em in it.</P>
<P>Reason and the Law of Nature direct that those
who have made an ill use of the Privileges granted
to 'em, should be depriv'd of 'em. Now the Juris∣diction
allow'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over the <HI>Indians</HI> was
only on condition they would instruct 'em in Reli∣gion,
and defend 'em from their Enemies; and they
have not only fallen short of this Engagement, but
even barbarously abus'd those they were oblig'd to
protect. 'Tis remarkable in the Laws of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that if a Master treats any one of his Slaves inhu∣manly,
he is oblig'd to sell him, because 'tis but just
that he who tyrannizes over his Subjects should lose
his Jurisdiction over 'em, which of right devolves
<PB N="225" REF="122"/>
on the Prince. He that abuses his Title is not wor∣thy
to possess it: and a Man neither owes Homage
nor Obedience to a Tyrant. So that your Majesty
ought in quality of Soveraign Lord of the People
of the New World, to defend 'em, and do 'em
Justice, when they are wrong'd; and consequently
to rescue 'em from the power of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that
they may enjoy their Liberty.</P>
<P>'Tis moreover a Custom establish'd by the Laws
of <HI>Spain,</HI> That if the King grant any Privilege
contrary to the Catholic Faith, 'tis null and void, as
much as if it were contrary to the civil Good and
Welfare of the Kingdom, or to the Rights of any
particular Persons. And the same account is to be
made of any Privilege given contrary to the Law
of Nature: as for example, if a King should take
away any private Man's Estate, to bestow it on ano∣ther.
Therefore your Majesty cannot divest the na∣tural
Princes of the <HI>Indians</HI> of their Dominion over
'em, to invest the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with it, who not only are
Foreigners to 'em, but also treat 'em after a tyrannical
manner. 'Tis therefore necessary for your Majesty
to revoke so unjust a Privilege, destructive to the
People, and directly opposit to the Catholic Faith,
as well as to your Majesty's Service, the advantage
of your Kingdom in general, the good of many
Members of the Commonwealth in particular, and
which is contrary to Reason, and the Law of Na∣ture.</P>
<P>'Tis farther constituted by the Customs of <HI>Spain,</HI>
in conformity to the Imperial Laws of your Ma∣jesty,
as well as those of the Church, that when a
Privilege in process of time proves injurious, and
occasions more hurt than good, it ought to be im∣mediately
abolish'd, without so much as consulting
the Prince that granted it; because from that very
moment wherein this Privilege began to be detri∣mental,
<PB N="226" REF="123"/>
it ought to be suppos'd the Prince design'd
to revoke it: so that it can have no more force or
authority, because not according to the Prince's In∣tention,
who always ought to have Equity and the
Divine Will in view. Now since the Privilege
granted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to subject the <HI>Indians</HI> as Vassals
is become so pernicious, and occasions an irrepa∣rable
damage to the Christian Religion, and to the
Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and has bin the cause of the ruin
of such vast numbers of People, and of the desola∣tion
of some of the finest Countries in the World;
and seeing in all appearance it is the very reason of
those Calamities with which God is now afflicting
<HI>Spain,</HI> 'tis necessary to apply a speedy Remedy, and
to go to the root of the Disease, in revoking so
pernicious and tyrannical a Grant.</P>
<P>Besides, the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over the
<HI>Indians</HI> has never bin judicially approv'd by the
Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> He that first shar'd these poor
People among 'em, as if they had been so many
Sheep, had no order to make this distribution,
which absolutely desolated and unpeopled <HI>New Spain,</HI>
but exceeded the limits of his Power; so that no just
Consequence can be drawn from what he did. It
was the great General <HI>d'Alcantara</HI> who began this
irregular course in <HI>America.</HI> In the year 1502, the
most serene King <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and Queen <HI>Isabella</HI> sent
General <HI>De-Larés</HI> from <HI>Grenada</HI> to govern the new
Conquests: At which time there were but three
hundred Christians in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> This
Governor was expresly charg'd to treat the <HI>Indians</HI>
as free Nations; to be very kind, tender and chari∣table
toward 'em, to do 'em exact Justice on all
occasions, and not to impose too severe a Yoke on
'em, or to inslave 'em; in a word, to protect 'em
from all Injuries, lest any Violence should prove a
Stumbling-block to divert 'em from entertaining
<PB N="227" REF="123"/>
the Christian Faith, and inspire 'em with an aversion
to the Professors of it. General <HI>De-Larés</HI> carried
with him three thousand <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who landed at
<HI>St. Domingo,</HI> where they soon found themselves re∣duc'd
to great straits for want of Food. However,
the strict Orders he had receiv'd would not permit
him to do any Violence to the <HI>Indians,</HI> or to infringe
their Liberty in the least; upon which he writes
many things to the Queen against the <HI>Indians,</HI> hop∣ing
to render 'em odious to her by his Lies and
Slanders, that he might have leave to abuse the poor
Wretches at his pleasure. Among other things he
wrote, that it would be impossible to preach the
Christian Faith to 'em as long as they were suffer'd
to enjoy an entire Freedom, because they industri∣ously
avoided all manner of acquaintance with the
Christians; in so much that they refus'd to work
for 'em, tho they offer'd 'em Wages for their La∣bor,
and chose rather to wander up and down as
Vagabonds, than to keep company with Christians
to inform themselves of their Religion. As if he
thought the <HI>Indians</HI> were oblig'd to divine that
there was a new Religion to be preach'd to 'em,
which they ought to embrace; or that they ought,
as poor as they are, to forsake their Houses, Wives
and Children, and to leave their Lands unmanur'd,
to come to seek the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and so expose them∣selves
to die with Hunger in a Journey it may be of
two hundred Leagues or more; or as if they were
under any obligation to undergo the fatigue of bring∣ing
Provision to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> such a tedious way as
this.</P>
<P>His Majesty, who was sincerely zealous for the
Salvation of these Idolaters, and publishing the
Name of Christ in the New World, answer'd the
General after this manner: <Q>We very ardently
desire the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI> to our holy
<PB N="228" REF="124"/>
Faith, and that they be taught the Mysteries of
the Catholic Religion; and think it necessary to
the success of this Design, that the <HI>Indians</HI> and
<HI>Spaniards</HI> converse and live together. Therefore
we by these Presents command you to oblige the
<HI>Indians</HI> to deal with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI>
and to have Conversation with 'em, to assist 'em
in building their Houses, and in getting Gold and
other Metals out of the Mines, and to pay 'em
their Wages exactly, according to their labor
and desert. You shall likewise order every <HI>Ca∣cique</HI>
to have a certain number of <HI>Indians</HI> always
in a readiness to be employ'd in such Work as
shall be assign'd 'em, provided that care be taken
to preach to 'em, and instruct 'em in the Word
of God on all Holy-days, and that they be always
treated as Free-men, and not as Slaves; and be∣sure
let them meet with no ill usage, nor have any
occasion to complain: Yet let some distinction be
still made in favor of such as embrace the Faith.
But let no Person be permitted to wrong 'em, or
give 'em the least disgust in any thing whatsoever.</Q>
These are the very words of the Letter which the
King sent to the Governor of the <HI>Indies,</HI> by which
his Majesty sufficiently signified that his principal
design in the <HI>Indies</HI> was the Salvation of those Ido∣laters,
and that for that end they should converse
with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which plainly proves he had no
other regard to this Commerce betwixt the Christi∣ans
and these Infidels, but only as a necessary means
for their Conversion. And it must be farther ob∣serv'd,
that when the King gives order to oblige
each <HI>Cacique</HI> to send the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a certain number
of <HI>Indians</HI> to work for 'em, on condition of being
paid for their Labor, he did not intend that all the
Men in the <HI>Indies</HI> should be bound to perform such
Tasks, much less that the Women, Children, old
<PB N="229" REF="124"/>
Men, and Chiefs of each Nation, whom the <HI>Indians</HI>
look upon as their natural Princes, should be thus
treated. The King design'd there should be due
consideration had of their Necessities, that they
should have liberty to provide for their Wives and
Children, and go every night home to refresh them∣selves
with their Families, and sleep in their own
Houses. And it may be farther remark'd in the
King's Patent, that he did not in the least design
the <HI>Indians</HI> should be made to work every day and
without intermission, seeing it provides they should
be paid daily after their Labor; his intention was
that they should be engag'd by fair means to do
what was requir'd of 'em, and not forc'd to it whe∣ther
they would or no; in short, that they should
be us'd in all respects as a free People. Besides, the
King commanded that all their Labors should be
moderate, and proportionate to their Strength, and
that they should rest on Holy-days and Sundays, that
their Wages should be sutable to their Work, suffi∣cient
to encourage 'em in taking pains, and to re∣lieve
their Families in all their domestick Necessi∣ties.</P>
<P>If the King had a perfect account of the nature
of the Land in the <HI>Indies,</HI> of the Weakness, Pover∣ty,
Meekness and good humor of the Inhabitants,
of the rigor and severity of their Labors, and the
great difficulty of getting Gold out of the Mines;
if he knew the desolate state in which they are often
left, and the little care taken to engage 'em to re∣ceive
the Sacraments before they die, he would
without doubt employ some effectual means to put
an end to these Disorders. The first Admiral of
the <HI>Indies,</HI> who made the discovery of this New
World, though the acted conformably to the King's
Interest in rendering the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>New Spain</HI> tri∣butary,
by obliging 'em to dig a certain quantity
<PB N="230" REF="125"/>
of Gold out of the Mines, and condemning others
that were remote from any Mines to other kinds of
Tribute. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he carried with
him, shook off the Obedience they ow'd the King,
and set up for so many Tyrants, committing Vio∣lence
and Spoil beyond what can be easily imagin'd
in the Province of <HI>Xavagua,</HI> one of the finest and
most populous Countries in the <HI>Indies.</HI> The King
being inform'd of these Ravages, wrote his mind
to General <HI>De-Larés,</HI> and order'd him to put a stop
to the Cruelty and Violence of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the
<HI>Indians,</HI> and to govern 'em as a free People, which
Orders were not well executed: For the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
shut up the <HI>Indians</HI> by force in the Mines, to employ
'em in the toilsom work of digging for Gold, which
requires a very robust Constitution: And when
they had got this Gold, they were forc'd to be all
day in the Water to wash it. At first the <HI>Indians</HI>
were kept in the Mines for a whole year, till the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> found they were not able to endure such
hard and continual Labor, and therefore gave 'em
some time of respite, contenting themselves to
keep 'em only for five Months in digging Gold, after
which they employ'd 'em forty days in melting it.
This they pretended was a time of rest for these
poor Creatures, tho this latter sort of Work is
more toilsom than that of grubbing up of Roots,
and clearing Ground that is over-run with Wood:
so that they don't know what a Holy-day or Sun∣day
means throughout the whole year. They are
sometimes almost famish'd, having nothing given
'em save a few dry Roots that yield but little Nu∣triment:
Tho the most liberal of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dis∣tribute
a Porker once a week among half a hundred
<HI>Indians,</HI> which is little more than every one a taste.
Nay some of 'em have not been willing to give the
<HI>Indians</HI> that serv'd 'em any thing at all to eat, but
<PB N="231" REF="125"/>
out of mere Avarice sent 'em to feed like Beasts in
the fields, or to gather fruit upon the Mountains,
after which they forc'd 'em to work two or three
days together without eating. One Man frankly
confess'd to me that he had got a great Estate in a
little time by this kind of frugality. What strength
can Bodies that are naturally of a tender Constitu∣tion
be suppos'd to have when fed after this manner,
and oppress'd besides with excessive Labor? 'Tis
impossible they should subsist long under this cruel
Bondage; which makes 'em lead a sorrowful, lan∣guishing
and miserable Life, being destitute both of
convenient Food and Rest.</P>
<P>Tho the King order'd each <HI>Indian</HI> to be paid in
proportion to his Work, that they might have some∣thing
to live on, and be capable of buying them∣selves
Necessaries; this Command has been ill ob∣serv'd,
for they had nothing at all for many years;
so that they were put to the greatest Extremity,
and suffer'd Hunger to that degree that they desir'd
nothing more than to die, that they might find an
end of their Miseries. These are the Calamities
the poor <HI>Indians</HI> have suffer'd in the Service of
Christians, who have had no regard either to their
Souls or Bodies.</P>
<P>As for those Orders that have been given the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to treat the <HI>Indians</HI> as a free People, not
to over-charge 'em with Labor, not to do 'em any▪
Injustice, and to let 'em mind their own Affairs,
and order their business as they saw good, they have
bin no more heeded than the other. For they have
been made mere Slaves, and certainly have not so
much liberty as Beasts. And the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as good
Christians as they are, are not at all mov'd by all
the Calamities these poor Wretches undergo, but look
upon them as the vilest of Slaves, and not fit to have
the liberty of doing any thing they have a mind to
<PB N="232" REF="126"/>
do. They are constantly expos'd to the Cruelty of
these Tyrants, and not treated like human Crea∣tures,
but wild Beasts, who are kept in Chains by
their Owners, and dispos'd of at their pleasure.
If they sometimes let 'em go to their own Country,
they will not suffer 'em to carry their Wives and
Children with 'em, nor hardly any thing to eat; so
that they are presently constrain'd to return, while
the Reflection they make on their deplorable Con∣dition
often makes 'em desire death to relieve 'em.
If the excessive Labors impos'd on 'em make 'em
sick, as it often happens (because, as I have ob∣serv'd,
the natural Temper of their Bodies is none
of the strongest) the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do not in the least
pity their Condition, but oppress 'em with intole∣rable
Tasks, reproaching 'em as lazy, and only
feigning themselves ill to be excus'd from Labor.
And when they see their Sickness increase, so that
they become unserviceable, they send 'em to their
own Country, which is sometimes forty or fifty
Leagues distance, giving 'em nothing but a few sap∣less
Roots to eat by the way, so that they often die
miserably, not being able to accomplish such a Jour∣ney.
Sometimes we find some of 'em on the Road
just ready to expire, others groaning hideously in
the Agonies of Death, and others quite dead. Those
of 'em that are able to speak, say nothing but <HI>Hun∣ger,
Hunger.</HI> Your Majesty by this account may see
that the Governor of the New World had little
regard to the Orders that were given him, to treat
the <HI>Indians</HI> as a free People.</P>
<P>That Governor was expresly charg'd not to do
any thing to the <HI>Indians</HI> that might hinder 'em from
receiving the Principles of the Christian Religion,
or prejudice their Lives or Health, because the King
had no design to destroy 'em: yet this Man saw in∣finit
numbers of 'em perish that were imploy'd in
<PB N="233" REF="126"/>
melting of Gold. The Labors exacted of 'em were
like a furious Pestilence, which cuts off multitudes
of People in a little time; and yet this sad Spectacle
could not engage him to revoke his cruel Orders,
or so much as mitigate the severity of 'em. How∣ever
he knew well enough that he was not able to
excuse his Proceedings either before God or the
King, being expresly contrary to the Charge that
had been given him; and therefore us'd so much
Subtilty and Artifice in the management of this
Affair, that none of his Cruelties on the <HI>Indians</HI>
were known in <HI>Spain</HI> for those seven years in which
he tyranniz'd over the New World. They that
came after him, trod in his steps by destroying the
<HI>Indians,</HI> tho his Catholic Majesty recommended it
to 'em to induce the <HI>Indians</HI> to receive the Catholic
Faith, by shewing all kindness to 'em, and not to
make War upon 'em on the account of Religion, or
to constrain 'em to embrace Christianity by force,
but rather to treat 'em as the King's Liege People,
imposing a certain Tribute on 'em, as on his other
Subjects. All this was express'd in the Instructions
given to <HI>Pedrarias,</HI> when he was made Governor of
the <HI>Indies;</HI> notwithstanding which he enter'd <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>
just as a hungry Wolf falls on a flock of Sheep,
and made horrible slaughters on all sides, using such
unheard of Torments, and making such waste and
spoil, that nothing like it is to be found in any
History. He might have been look'd upon as a
heavy Plague, sent by God to execute his Wrath in
extirpating the <HI>Indians.</HI> This Man, and those that
accompanied him, cheated your Majesty of five or
six Millions of Gold, and 'tis impossible to compute
the Spoil they made in the <HI>Indies.</HI> They depopulated
a Country of above four hundred Leagues, as rich,
fertil and pleasant as any in the World. All this
Tyranny was us'd to make the <HI>Indians</HI> deliver up
<PB N="234" REF="127"/>
all their Gold: But by the just Judgment of God
they made no great advantage of their Robberies;
and it would have bin more for their interest to
have kept the <HI>Indians</HI> alive, and to have made a con∣siderable
Profit out of their hard Labors. If a par∣ticular
account should be given your Majesty of all
the Disorders committed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the
noble Province of <HI>Nicaraqua,</HI> your Majesty would
be astonish'd; and if they had not still continued
their Tyranny over these poor People, every day
killing and destroying 'em, I should not have ex∣pos'd
my self to the fatigue of so tedious and trou∣blesom
a Voyage, to give your Majesty an account
of it. When your Majesty is assur'd that the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
have depopulated so many vast and noble King∣doms,
and that they still continue to destroy what∣ever
escap'd the fury of former Governors; when
you are convinc'd that they have carried Fire and
Sword through seven Kingdoms that are larger than
<HI>Spain,</HI> your Majesty will easily be perswaded that
what I have said is no Exaggeration. I have seen
these Kingdoms in a manner as full of People as
Hives are of Bees, where now there are none to be
found, having been all murder'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
so that there are only naked Walls and empty
Houses to be seen in many once populous Cities.
The Orders given by the most Catholic Queen <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>
to General <HI>De-Larés</HI> were very prudent and
useful, but he did not think fit to observe 'em; and
the Relation he gave the King and Queen of matters
from time to time, were very far from Truth, tho
supported by the Testimony of divers <HI>Indians.</HI> He
acted quite contrary to the Instructions given him,
violating all the Rules of the Law of Nature and
Reason; by which 'tis evident he went beyond his
Commission, and prevaricated in those Letters he
directed to the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI> by intermixing
<PB N="235" REF="127"/>
Falshoods in his account, and disguising what was
true. And 'tis certain if your Majesty had been
inform'd how tyrannically this Governor treated
the <HI>Indians,</HI> you would never have entrusted your
Authority in his hands; and by consequence your
Majesty is oblig'd to declare that you detest the Pro∣ceedings
of this Governor as injust and tyrannical,
and to abrogate all he has done, and declare that
the <HI>Indians</HI> ought not to have been subjected to the
Dominion of particular Men, and that all the In∣juries
they have suffer'd are contrary to the Law of
God and Nature, as well as to the Imperial and
Canon Laws; seeing they have been tormented in
their Persons, molested in their Liberty and Estates,
and condemn'd to die. Your Majesty is oblig'd, as
you are a just Prince, and an Enemy to Violence, to
suppress these vexatious Practices, and to deliver the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> from the Tyranny of those that have
oppress'd and tormented 'em.</P>
<P>If your Majesty neglect to take this cruel Yoke
from their Necks, they will infallibly perish. And
that lovely Country which is naturally fruitful and
populous will soon become a vast Desert; for the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that go thither, don't go to people the
Country, but to inrich themselves by pillaging it.
Those that have lately gon into <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and
other depopulated places, and carried thither the
Commodities of <HI>Europe,</HI> have not been able to dis∣pose
of 'em, there not being People to buy 'em: So
that these Disorders are directly opposite to your
Majesty's Interest; for what advantage can you re∣ceive
from the ruin of those People? And what will
the World say of so just a Prince as your Majesty,
if when you are inform'd of the mischief don by
your Subjects in those vast Kingdoms, and among
such multitudes of People, you should not apply su∣table
Remedies to so dangerous a Disease? It can't

of Gold out of the Mines, and condemning others
that were remote from any Mines to other kinds of
Tribute. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he carried with

what I have said is no Exaggeration. I have seen
these Kingdoms in a manner as full of People as
Hives are of Bees, where now there are none to be
found, having been all murder'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
so that there are only naked Walls and empty
Houses to be seen in many once populous Cities.
The Orders given by the most Catholic Queen <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>
to General <HI>De-Larés</HI> were very prudent and
useful, but he did not think fit to observe 'em; and
the Relation he gave the King and Queen of matters
from time to time, were very far from Truth, tho
supported by the Testimony of divers <HI>Indians.</HI> He
acted quite contrary to the Instructions given him,
violating all the Rules of the Law of Nature and
Reason; by which 'tis evident he went beyond his
Commission, and prevaricated in those Letters he
directed to the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI> by intermixing
<PB N="235" REF="130"/>
Falshoods in his account, and disguising what was
true. And 'tis certain if your Majesty had been
inform'd how tyrannically this Governor treated
the <HI>Indians,</HI> you would never have entrusted your
Authority in his hands; and by consequence your
Majesty is oblig'd to declare that you detest the Pro∣ceedings
of this Governor as injust and tyrannical,
and to abrogate all he has done, and declare that
the <HI>Indians</HI> ought not to have been subjected to the
Dominion of particular Men, and that all the In∣juries
they have suffer'd are contrary to the Law of
God and Nature, as well as to the Imperial and
Canon Laws; seeing they have been tormented in
their Persons, molested in their Liberty and Estates,
and condemn'd to die. Your Majesty is oblig'd, as
you are a just Prince, and an Enemy to Violence, to
suppress these vexatious Practices, and to deliver the
poor <HI>Indians</HI> from the Tyranny of those that have
oppress'd and tormented 'em.</P>
<P>If your Majesty neglect to take this cruel Yoke
from their Necks, they will infallibly perish. And
that lovely Country which is naturally fruitful and
populous will soon become a vast Desert; for the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that go thither, don't go to people the
Country, but to inrich themselves by pillaging it.
Those that have lately gon into <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and
other depopulated places, and carried thither the
Commodities of <HI>Europe,</HI> have not been able to dis∣pose
of 'em, there not being People to buy 'em: So
that these Disorders are directly opposit to your
Majesty's Interest; for what advantage can you re∣ceive
from the ruin of those People? And what will
the World say of so just a Prince as your Majesty,
if when you are inform'd of the mischief don by
your Subjects in those vast Kingdoms, and among
such multitudes of People, you should not apply su∣table
Remedies to so dangerous a Disease? it can't
<PB N="236" REF="131"/>
be thought that your Majesty, whose Mind abounds
with so much Goodness, and so great a Zeal for
Equity and Justice, can tolerate such cruel Oppressi∣ons
as these.</P>
<P>To what has been said, it may be added, to de∣monstrate
that the power the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have over
the <HI>Indians</HI> is prejudicial to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that by this means your Majesty loses an infinit
number of Subjects, who are every day cut off with∣out
any lawful occasion; whereas if suffer'd to live,
they would chearfully submit to your Majesty's Go∣vernment
when they saw the difference between
your Majesty's Yoke, and that Slavery in which
they are held by their private Masters. If your
Majesty had once receiv'd 'em into the number of
your Subjects, so that they might be secur'd from
the inhuman Severities they now daily endure, they
would love and serve your Majesty with incredible
Zeal, being naturally inclin'd to be very submissive
to their Princes.</P>
<P>Your Majesty may farther consider, that you lose
immense Riches by the cruel depopulation of the
<HI>Indies,</HI> which otherwise you might justly acquire;
for 'tis impossible for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to subsist long in
the <HI>Indies,</HI> if the Natives be exterminated. And
those Treasures sufficient to enrich all <HI>Spain,</HI> would
be no small advantage to promote your Designs, and
enable you to resist your Enemies. If there come
no Mony from the <HI>Indies,</HI> but that Spring of Trea∣sure
be suffer'd to dry up, <HI>Spain</HI> must necessarily
sustain great Inconveniences for want of it. Ex∣perience
already shews that the <HI>Indies</HI> don't furnish
us with so great a quantity as in time past, and 'tis
likely to diminish more and more for time to come.
Besides, the manner of extorting it from the <HI>Indians</HI>
can't possibly last long, because 'tis too violent a
course. The Isle of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> is an unexceptionable
<PB N="237" REF="131"/>
Instance of what I say; for whereas above three
Millions of very fine Gold were drawn out of it at
first, it cannot now afford the tenth part of that
Sum. The least Reflection your Majesty can make
will easily convince you how your Revenues every
day diminish. Your Majesty has nothing certain and
stable in the <HI>Indies,</HI> if the Land be not cultivated,
and the Inhabitants preserv'd for those Labors that
are so advantageous. You have now but a small
number of <HI>Indians</HI> in all <HI>New Spain,</HI> from whence
your Majesty might annually have drawn a Million
of Ducats, if the <HI>Indians</HI> had been preserv'd, and
your Majesty's Interest at first regarded. There
have been yet greater Confusions and Disorders in
<HI>Peru,</HI> and the Mischief daily increases; from which
Kingdom your Majesty might yearly receive two or
three Millions of Gold if the <HI>Indians</HI> were not
treated with so much Injustice and Inhumanity, ma∣ny
of 'em having been murder'd, togther with their
great King <HI>Atabalipa.</HI> All the Gold the Christians
have taken by force in <HI>Peru</HI> would of right have
belong'd to your Majesty, because that <HI>Indian</HI> Prince
would have voluntarily presented himself to your
Majesty with all his Treasures. The Church has
likewise receiv'd great damage by these Cruelties;
for as your Majesty has been frustrated of those
immense Riches, so the Church has lost an infinit
number of Souls who have perish'd in their Igno∣rance,
when they might have been taught the Myste∣ries
of our Faith: so that the Losses sustain'd both
by Church and State are irreparable.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> which your Majesty rules
with so much Equity, is surrounded with Enemies,
and in danger of being wasted and ruin'd by the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> those declar'd Enemies of the
Catholic Faith: Because God, who is the just Judg
and Soveraign Lord of the Universe, is grievously
<PB N="238" REF="132"/>
offended with the Violence and Massacres which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have committed in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where they
have opprest and slaughter'd innumerable multi∣tudes
of People. These <HI>Indians</HI> have rational Souls
form'd after the image and likeness of God, and
ransom'd by the Blood of his Son, who keeps an
account of 'em, and will not think 'em of no value,
how ignorant and barbarous soever they seem to
be. He was pleas'd to choose <HI>Spain</HI> to the Service
of carrying the Light of the Gospel into the New
World, and to engage those Nations to entertain
the Christian Faith. And it seem'd as if the Al∣mighty
had discover'd all these Temporal Riches to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as a recompense for those Spiritual
Pleasures with which they were to enrich the <HI>Indies.</HI>
But tho he open'd a way for 'em into those vast
Regions, so wealthy, fertil and pleasant, so full of
Mines of Gold, Silver and precious Stones; instead
of being thankful for all these Favors, they have
committed the most hainous Crimes to provoke him.
Now 'tis usual for God to distribute his Punishments
by a rule of proportion, adjusting them to the na∣ture
of the Offence. If Men sin by Pride, he covers
'em with Confusion and Shame; if they get any
thing unjustly through Avarice, he often suffers 'em
to lose their own Goods; and they that have stolen,
are in turn rob'd themselves. Those that oppress
and murder others, he permits to fall into the hands
of such as treat 'em with the like Cruelty: They
that take away their Neighbors Wives and violate
'em, have sometimes the same Outrages committed
on their own. And such as usurp Kingdoms that
don't belong to 'em, by God's Judgment come to
see their own Kingdoms invaded by their Enemies;
and thus it is with other Judgments which frequently
answer the different kinds of Sin. The Holy Scrip∣ture
and other Histories are full of Instances to this
<PB N="239" REF="132"/>
purpose; and Experience every day furnishes us
with such marks of the Divine Displeasure as these.
The <HI>Moors</HI> once over-run <HI>Spain,</HI> and this was in∣terpreted
as a Judgment from God to punish the
Crime of King <HI>Roderick,</HI> who ravish'd the Daughter
of Count <HI>Don Julian,</HI> tho 'tis more probable it was
to punish the Crimes of the People of <HI>Spain,</HI> and
the Injuries they offer'd their Neighbours, and that
the Crime of this King only fill'd up the measure of
those Vices.</P>
<P>'Tis convenient to inform your Majesty what is
thought by Persons of the best sense, who are go∣vern'd
by no Prejudice, but only compassionate the
Sufferings of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> I have heard many
such Persons say, I pray God these extravagant
Cruelties don't one day fall heavy upon <HI>Spain!</HI> It
may be such words as these that drop from many
wise Men, are so many Advertisements and Menaces
from God, who has been highly incens'd against this
Nation by the Crimes of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> And we
already see that <HI>Spain</HI> is reduc'd to great Necessities,
and Mony is very scarce among us; tho more Trea∣sures
have bin brought hither than <HI>Solomon</HI> possess'd
in all his Glory: Most of those that have brought
these Riches from the <HI>Indies</HI> have made a miserable
end, and their Children are reduc'd to extreme
Poverty, which justifies the old Maxim, <HI>Vix gaudet
tertius Haeres,</HI> the third Heir seldom enjoys an ill-gotten
Estate; and that Passage of holy Scripture,
<HI>He that oppresseth the poor to increase his Riches—shall
surely come to want,</HI> Prov. 22. 16. Because, as has
bin said, the Divine Judgments bear some propor∣tion
to the Crimes that Men commit. If your Ma∣jesty
have the curiosity to inform your self of the
detail of all these matters, we can shew you a List
of the principal Tyrants that have committed the
greatest Disorders in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by pillaging and
<PB N="240" REF="133"/>
massacring those poor People, and have themselves
all died in a dreadful and despairing manner. It
seems their Violence and Cruelty, the great quan∣tity
of Blood shed in the Massacres they have com∣mited,
and their other vicious Actions, the effects
of which are yet to be seen, cry aloud to Heaven
for Vengeance; while the Tears, and Sighs, and
Entreaties of so many poor Innocents have filled
Heaven and Earth, and put all the World into a
Consternation, to the utter shame and reproach of
all the Spanish Nation, and of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
too. Since then it depends only on your Majesty to
lay the Ax to the Root of all these Disorders, and to
do Justice to these afflicted People, it will be an
Argument of your Prudence and Equity to employ
your Power to deliver the <HI>Indians</HI> from the terrible
Oppressions and Calamities under which they yet
groan.</P>
<P>Your Majesty may be pleas'd farther to observe,
that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have an Authority given 'em
over the <HI>Indians,</HI> however it may be qualified, they
will infallibly abuse it; for being naturally proud,
they'l become still less obedient to your Majesty's
Commands: Nay the immense Sums which they'l
get in the <HI>Indies</HI> will enable 'em to confederate
with other Nations, to withdraw their Allegiance
entirely from your Majesty at long-run, and to sup∣port
one another in their Rebellion. We already
see that the richest of 'em, that flatter themselves
with the Title of Conquerors, are so intolerably
presumptuous, as to set themselves above the Rules
of common Justice. Your Majesty's Vice-roy said
not long since in one of his Letters, that the <HI>Indians</HI>
ought to acknowlege no other God nor King than
himself. Your Majesty therefore should take it for
granted that it is not consistent with the Security of
your Government, that there should be any great
<PB N="241" REF="133"/>
Lord in the Continent of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> invested
with an absolute Jurisdiction over the <HI>Indians;</HI> this
Power ought to be inseparable from your Royal
Person: 'Tis not convenient for the future to give
any one the Title of Count, Marquess, or Duke over
either the <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Spaniards</HI> that are setled there;
because 'twill prompt 'em to think too highly of
themselves, and to advance themselves above their
Condition, which may have very mischievous Con∣sequences:
In a word, this may probably open 'em
a way to make themselves Kings of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
thereby devest your Majesty of the Right you have
to those Countries.</P>
<P>Nor will it be more safe to trust this Power in
the hands of those Gentlemen that compose your
Majesty's Council in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which may also be
attended with Inconveniences; for 'tis impossible
for the Affairs of <HI>America</HI> to be well administred if
the Members of that Council be absolute Lords of
the <HI>Indians:</HI> To be sure then the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
shall never know the truth of what passes there;
this would produce nothing but Fraud and Im∣posture,
and be an infallible means to compleat the
Ruin of the <HI>Indies.</HI> They that govern in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
industriously endeavour to prevent the Court of
<HI>Spain</HI> from receiving any true Information how
matters stand there, that they may securely pillage
the Country, and live at their own Discretion.
They have oppos'd those Friers whose Zeal carried
'em to <HI>America</HI> to preach, and have hinder'd 'em from
reaping the fruit they might have expected from
their Labors. The Judges and other Officers were
afraid the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI> would be pre∣judicial
to their Temporal Interest; and Avarice
bore sway in their Minds instead of that Zeal they
ought to have had for the Salvation of those Infi∣dels.
God is witness that this is true, and 'tis not
<PB N="242" REF="134"/>
difficult to prove it. They continued to persecute
the Monks, till one of 'em, pitying them iserable
case of these Idolaters, came on purpose to inform
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> of the Violence of his Officers,
and of the Obstructions they rais'd against the pub∣lication
of the Gospel there. Cardinal <HI>Ximenes</HI> at
that time manag'd the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> who being
well inform'd of the Affairs in the <HI>Indies,</HI> imme∣diately
resolv'd to devest the Council there of the
Jurisdiction they pretended to have over the <HI>Indians,</HI>
as being very pernicious. But the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
are at so vast a distance from those Countries, that
they have not been able speedily to redress all the
pressing Grievances that incessantly afflict those mi∣serable
People. Their Laws and Orders given at
so great a distance have no great Efficacy: and 'tis
next to impossible for 'em to have a true account
what Persecutions the <HI>Indians</HI> suffer: Or if a true
Information should be had, they can only give some
general Orders, without descending to make spe∣cial
provision against all those Mischiefs that can't
be well known unless they were upon the place
where they are acted. Besides, the Persons to whom
these Orders are directed, commonly conceal 'em,
or defer the execution of 'em; so that when they go
about to fulfil 'em, 'tis too late, and the Remedies
applied prove unseasonable and useless. Nay, they
are often so wicked as to act in direct contradiction
to what is commanded 'em; and flatter themselves
with hopes of never being call'd to account, because
they are so remote from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>If your Majesty would reserve to your self alone
the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Indies,</HI> without sharing it
among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> it would be the greatest hap∣piness
imaginable to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and nothing could
more rejoice 'em, because then they would be con∣vinc'd
they should be no more expos'd to the In∣sults
<PB N="243" REF="134"/>
and Persecutions of their Enemies; and would
have so great a respect for your Majesty, obey you
so universally, and love you so sincerely, that they
would be always ready to sacrifice their Lives for
your Service. You could then require nothing of
'em, but they would do it chearfully, because they
seem to have a great propension to submit to
your Royal Crown; whereas if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
their absolute Masters, as their Obedience will
be forc'd, so it will be of no long continuance,
and they'l do all they can to get free of so severe
a Yoke.</P>
<P>Moreover, when the <HI>Indians</HI> are once perswaded
they are under your Protection, that they may live
safely in their own Houses, and need fear no injury
either in their Persons or Goods; all that are re∣tir'd
to the Mountains will soon come down to dwell
in the Plains, as they were wont heretofore. For
abundance of 'em have retreated to avoid the Cru∣elties
of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and chuse rather to be de∣vour'd
by wild Beasts in the Mountains, than to fall
into the hands of their Persecutors, tho Christians.
The poor Wretches suffer a world of Inconveniences
in those places whither they have retir'd, wanting
almost all the Necessaries of Life: And 'tis impossi∣ble
to find 'em out to instruct 'em in the Christian
Faith: whereas if they liv'd together in Towns and
Cities, they might easily be taught Religion, and a
regular sort of Government establish'd among 'em,
whereby they would be brought to the Service of
the True God, which would become familiar to 'em:
By this means the Ground would be cultivated, the
Roads frequented and render'd more safe, and the
Country no longer be desert and forlorn: The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> would be supplied with Provisions, and
convenient places to lodg in on their Journeys, and
have a thousand other Advantages of which they
<PB N="244" REF="135"/>
are now depriv'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> deserting their Ha∣bitations.</P>
<P>Your Majesty may remember that after a mature
examination of this Affair by many learned Men
and able Divines, they unanimously declar'd, that
the Dominion of the <HI>Indies</HI> could not be justly given
to private Men, nor dismember'd from your Ma∣jesty's
Crown. This Determination was signified
to <HI>Ferdinando Cortez,</HI> with orders to put it in execu∣tion.
Your Majesty was pleas'd on the same account
again to call together an Assembly of Persons of
great Learning and Virtue, who after a long de∣bate,
declar'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not lawfully
be made Lords of the <HI>Indies.</HI> After which your
Majesty gave most express Orders to prohibit it,
revoking all Grants to the contrary procur'd on
those false Accounts and Misrepresentations that
had been given you. Your Majesty commanded the
Governor of <HI>Florida</HI> to put these Edicts in execution,
as may be still seen by his Instructions. Among the
principal Articles of these Constitutions, one is,
That the <HI>Indians</HI> ought to be accounted free, and
not obliged to any other Services than the rest of
your Majesty's Subjects who enjoy their Liberty
under your Government: That they ought to
pay Tithes to God, unless excus'd for some time,
and likewise such Tribute to your Majesty as is im∣pos'd
lawfully, and in proportion to the Goods
they possess, and the quality of their Land, accord∣ing
to the reasonable Estimate of those that govern
'em.</P>
<P>If it be desir'd that the <HI>Indians</HI> should be taught
the Catholic Faith, and brought to embrace our
Customs, while they keep up a sort of Government
among themselves, your Majesty ought not to give
them as Slaves to any one whatsoever, either for
ever, or for a limited time; for this would be to ex∣pose
<PB N="245" REF="135"/>
'em to the same Miseries they have hitherto
endur'd, and perhaps to increase them: for after
this there will be no dependence to be had on the
Orders and Prohibitions made in favour of the
<HI>Indians,</HI> whatever Penalties shall be annex'd to fa∣cilitate
their Execution; for those that have bin
already made are very wise Edicts, and might be
very useful if put in practice. And one chief
Reason against giving the <HI>Indians</HI> for Vassals to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is the small account these latter
make of the Lives of those poor Creatures; for
'tis not to be imagin'd with what Contempt they
look upon 'em, unless by those that have seen it:
Their excessive Covetousness induces 'em to make
'em labor beyond their Strength, not caring what
becomes of 'em so they get any thing by 'em.
If any Persons give your Majesty a contrary ac∣count
of these matters, you ought to look upon 'em
as Enemies to the State, and disaffected to your Ma∣jesty's
Service.</P>
<P>If your Majesty be convinc'd by the Arguments
produc'd, you will prevent the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from com∣mitting
a great many Violences and Murders, of
which they are every day guilty. You will secure
<HI>Spain</HI> from this Contagion, in preventing your
People at home from partaking of the Sins of
their fellow-Subjects, and sharing the Plunder with
them which they have so unjustly gotten. For all
Men of sense acknowledg that the Crimes of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> render all <HI>Spain</HI> obnoxious to
the Curse of God; that the course they take to be∣come
rich is unjust; that the Gold and Silver they
bring from the <HI>Indies</HI> is stolen, and that they are
oblig'd to restore it to the right Owners whom
they have unjustly plunder'd: which likewise evi∣dences
that those that partake of these usurp'd
Riches have no good Title to 'em; for they ought
<PB N="246" REF="136"/>
to have no Commerce with those publick Robbers,
nor to sell 'em any Commodities for their stolen
Gold; they should not so much as receive Presents
from 'em, or consent to be their Heirs: And if so,
it follows that all <HI>Spain</HI> is become guilty of the
Crimes of those Men; so that there are few but
have reason to be under trouble of Conscience, and
are in danger of Damnation, because there are scarce
any who have not participated of the Rapine of
those that have come from the New World.</P>
<P>It has bin objected by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that if they
have not a Jurisdiction over the <HI>Indians</HI> as their
Vassals, it will be impossible for 'em to live in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
and consequently that your Majesty will not be
able to keep those Kingdoms that have bin conquer'd
in your Name, nor to publish the Catholic Faith
there. For they say, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can't subsist
there, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> can't preserve his Domi∣nion
over the <HI>Indians,</HI> nor maintain Monks among
'em to preach to 'em, so that they must be destitute
of the Light of the Gospel; and those of 'em that
have already receiv'd it, will gradually lose it for
want of fresh Instruction, and so return to their for∣mer
Idolatry, and other Sins.</P>
<P>They that reason after this manner, do it not so
much from a Principle of true Zeal and Compassion,
lest so many Souls should perish, as from a desire of
oppressing these People, and that they may grow
rich by the Spoil they get from 'em. 'Tis only their
privat Interest makes 'em talk at this rate; for they
are not at all concern'd about your Majesty's Inte∣rest,
or the Salvation of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Tis not
the Good of the Public, or the Glory of God that
moves 'em; for their Conduct sufficiently shews what
little respect they have to the Law of God, which
forbids 'em to do the least hurt to any one, how
great an advantage soever it might procure 'em.
<PB N="247" REF="136"/>
They ought to know, if they have the true Senti∣ments
of Christianity, that tho your Majesty should
run the risk of losing all your Conquests in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
and be render'd uncapable of causing the
Christian Faith to be preach'd among the <HI>Indians;</HI> it
were better to forgo all such great Advantages, than
to obtain 'em by ruining the Inhabitants after the
manner hitherto practis'd. It had bin no great Mis∣fortune
to your Majesty, if your Empire had not
extended so far as the <HI>Indies;</HI> and 'tis an ill way of
going to work, to endeavour to establish Christianity
there by such criminal Methods. The reason of
which is evident, because we are forbidden <HI>to do evil
that good may come,</HI> Rom. 3. 8. God is not pleas'd
with the greatest Sacrifices if polluted with any Sin,
but abhors all such Offerings. 'Tis a most hainous
Sin, and worthy of eternal Damnation, to massacre
Infidels on pretence of introducing the Christian
Faith among 'em, and of extirpating a part of 'em
to save the rest. God dos not require Men to re∣ceive
his Word on such hard terms, and absolutely
forbids such a kind of Zeal for the Salvation of Souls
as this. He would not have us pretend to be more
concern'd about the Salvation of Souls than himself.
That which he requires of us is to keep within the
compass of his Laws, and not to exceed the Limits
he has prescrib'd. For 'twould be an Argument of
much Stupidity, and a great sin for any one to throw
a Child into a Well to baptize it, and so to drown
it on pretence of saving its Soul. And is it not a
greater Crime, and more odious and abominable in
the sight of God, to scandalize, destroy and massa∣cre
so many thousand People, under the pretext of
putting the rest in the way of Salvation? 'Tis our
business to do all the Good we can in conforming our
selves to God's Commandments, and keeping with∣in
the bounds he has set us, leaving the rest to him∣self.
<PB N="248" REF="137"/>
But this is a false Gloss which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
use to cover their Avarice; for the Salvation of the
<HI>Indians</HI> is no part of their Care; all they mind is
rather to ruin and inslave 'em, than to make Chris∣tians
of 'em. Therefore in opposition to all their
false Pretences, we assure your Majesty, that if you
please to reserve to your self alone the Dominion
of the <HI>Indies</HI> without admitting the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to
assume the quality of Lords and Masters over the
<HI>Indians,</HI> it will be an infallible means to establish the
Catholic Faith among them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will be
able to live commodiously among 'em in greater
numbers than they have hitherto done; and all
other Inconveniences will be remov'd, which will
mightly conduce to the Glory of God, the Advan∣tage
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Aggrandizement of your
Empire, and the general Good of all <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE
ART
OF
Travelling to Advantage.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS commonly thought that the Advantages
of Travelling are always out-balanc'd by
the Inconveniences that attend it; that
tho a Man is at never so much Charge in
his Voyages, he must still undergo a great deal of
Hardship; and when all is done, the Profit he reaps is
not to be compar'd with the Fatigues he endures.
But nothing can be more false than this Opinion; for
in truth, the advantage of Travelling infinitely sur∣mounts
the trouble of it: and as the Experiment of
a Chymist, whatever it costs him, is very well re∣warded
when he makes some considerable discovery
of Nature; so that Traveller that knows how to
improve his Mind as he ought by his Voyages, is al∣ways
well requited for the Inconveniences he has
sustain'd.</P>
<P>The Prejudice that some entertain, that the want
of that Experience which is to be gain'd in Voyages
and actual Discoveries, may be supplied by reading
Books that treat of such matters, or by the force of
the Imagination, which gives its own shape to all
things it represents, and never makes 'em appear as
they are in themselves, is a mere Illusion: For what∣ever
<PB N="2" REF="138"/>
ever forestals and prepossesses the Judgment is so
little capable of forming the Mind, that 'tis the ve∣ry
thing which corrupts it, and deprives it of its
natural relish for Truth, and that disposition to re∣ceive
it, which serves as a foundation for Reason to
build upon. That which is found in Books is not
always true; for besides that Decency will not per∣mit
Men to write but within the compass of certain
Rules, Flattery, the humor of the Time and Nation
wherein a Man lives, the public Interest, or the ma∣nagement
of private Affairs, always make some dif∣ference
between what a Man writes, and what may
be thought by those among whom he lives: Which
forms an almost invincible Obstacle in the way of
Truth, and hinders her from shewing her self in her
proper shape.</P>
<P>But in Travelling we find all imaginable help and
assistance to furnish our Minds with Experience and
Knowledg; for what is conceal'd in Books is by
this means openly discover'd to us; and we judg of
things with more safety, because we see 'em with
greater perspicuity when the Curtain is drawn aside.
When we go to the very Principles of things, and
draw Water at the Fountain, the taste and quality
of it must needs be most agreeable. This is the way
to know Men as they really are, and not only as the
Interest of some Persons makes 'em appear to be;
and to judg of their Actions, Manners, and Poli∣ticks
in themselves, and not on the Credit of fo∣reign
Relations; so that the Mind receiving thence
a pure and vivid light, that sets it above the dan∣ger
of Prejudice, is at the same time confirm'd and
improv'd on solid grounds, and at length rais'd to
the upper Region of Policy where its great Pheno∣mena
appear.</P>
<P>We are taught in the Book of <HI>Ecclesiastes,</HI> that to
become wise a Man must go into strange Countries,
<PB N="3" REF="138"/>
<HI>Sapiens in terram alienigenarum Gentium pertransiet;</HI>
and it follows afterwards, <HI>in absconditis suis concilia∣bitur,</HI>
by that means he shall be acquainted with the
most profound Notions of Wisdom, that is, of
RELIGION; <HI>Occulta Proverbiorum exquiret,</HI> he'll
make a scrutiny into their Maxims, Manners and
Customs, that is, into MORALITY: <HI>bona enim
&amp; mala in hominibus tentabit;</HI> he'll have the advan∣tage
by conversing with the Living (which is much
better than to consult the Dead) to know the sources
of that Good and Evil which Men do either to
themselves, or one another, that is, in one word,
POLICY. These are the three fundamental Prin∣ciples
by which a wise Man ought to regulate his
Conduct, and in these he ought to accomplish himself
by Travelling: For a Man is confirm'd in his <HI>Reli∣gion</HI>
by the knowledg he acquires of the importance
and certainty of it; he forms a solid Scheme of
<HI>Morality</HI> from the different Practices he observes in
the World, and informs himself in the true Rules
of <HI>Policy</HI> by the use he finds other People make
of 'em. From which it follows, that if a Man
would be wise, he ought to travel; and 'tis hard∣ly
to be expected that any one who neglects this
method, will prove eminent for Prudence and Po∣liticks.</P>
<P>This Art of Travelling to advantage requires
four Conditions that are all absolutely necessary in
every one that would succeed in it. The first is,
That his Mind be already form'd and fix'd, and yet
this in such a manner as not to be strictly determin'd.
The second is, That he be not prepossess'd with Pre∣judices.
The third is, That his Capacity bear a
proportion to the Science or Business to which he is
devoted, and in which he desires to be accomplish'd.
And the fourth is, That he want no assistance
necessary to bring him into acquaintance with the
<PB N="4" REF="139"/>
best Masters, and that he know their Sentiments at
the first hand.</P>
<P>I say, the first Condition is to have the Mind form'd,
but not determin'd; that is, it should not be so
crude as eagerly to receive all sorts of Impressions,
and yet sufficiently dispos'd to give a free admission
to Truth, which will perhaps be understood better
by an Example. One that travels too young is im∣mediately
dissatisfied in the exercis of the Religion
he professes, by the different manners of Worship
he discovers abroad; therefore the greenness of his
Age makes him run a greater risk than is commonly
thought in the discussion of matters of Religion,
tho it renders him very fit to endure Fatigues, the
difference of Climats, of Food, and of the various
Seasons of the Year. Nor is a Man any more fit to
improve by Travelling when too much advanc'd in
Years, because his Mind is too much determin'd,
and in no very good disposition to learn what he
thinks he knows well enough already. So that that
part of a Man's Age from twenty five to thirty five
is the most proper time for Travelling, because his
Mind is neither wholly crude, nor entirely form'd;
that which he has already learn'd only disposes him
to judg the better, while he seeks to be inform'd
after another manner; and thus he makes so fair a
decision of what he learns, that all the Sophisms in
the World will never shake him. By this 'tis easy
to see whence it is that so few are the better for
Travelling, and can only give an account of such
Circumstances as Soldiers and Postilions might ea∣sily
relate; 'tis to be attributed either to their too
great Youth or too great Age.</P>
<P>The second Qualification of a Traveller is, That
he be void of Prejudice in every thing, about which
he desires to receive Information; because Prejudice
produces such an Effect upon our Reason, as a Film
<PB N="5" REF="139"/>
does upon the Eye; it casts such a Mist upon it, and
renders it so uncapable to make a fair Judgment of
what is propos'd to it, that nothing can be more
opposite to the discovery of Truth than Prepossessi∣on,
which if it bear sway in the Mind, will give little
hope of improvement by Travelling.</P>
<P>The third Quality requisite is, To have a Capacity
of Mind proportionate to the business to which a man
applies himself, and in which he seeks to be accom∣plish'd:
For seeing the Rudiments of Painting and
other Arts are not to be learn'd by Travelling, and
observing the finest Strokes of the best Masters;
but a Man must be cut out for a business before he
presumes to seek Improvement in it by going abroad:
They that suppose to turn a Blockhead into a Man of
Parts by sending him into foreign Countries, will
find themselves mistaken. He that has but a small
Natural Capacity will never have a large one, what∣ever
course be taken to improve it: 'Tis true, he may
learn by Travelling to fill up what Capacity he has,
but he'll never be able to go beyond it; for the
Minds of Men have their several degrees of height
and strength, as well as their Bodies; and as 'tis
impossible by all the Art in the World to add one
inch to a Man's Stature when at his full growth, so
'tis utterly impracticable to enlarge the Capacity
of his Mind beyond the Bounds which Nature has
prescrib'd.</P>
<P>The fourth Qualification is, To be furnish'd with
all necessary Assistance to facilitate his Access to the
Masters of those Arts and Sciences he has a mind to
learn; in which respect every Country has a diffe∣rent
Genius; so that 'tis often seen, that what may
contribute to a man's assistance in one place, will by
no means do him any good in another. For in∣stance,
In <HI>Germany</HI> a man shall never get inward
with Great Men by being profuse in his Expences,
<PB N="6" REF="140"/>
but will by this means be the more likely to fall un∣der
suspicion, and become much less welcome than
one of another Character. To gain Esteem there,
a Man must bring with him a good Reputation, a
distiguish'd Birth, or an extraordinary Merit. In
<HI>Italy</HI> the quite contrary Humor obtains. And in the
<HI>Levant</HI> neither one nor t'other takes place, but an
Air of Simplicity, Sincerity and Honesty will in∣troduce
a Man into any Company. An eloquent
and voluble Tongue does well in <HI>Poland,</HI> but very
ill in <HI>Spain,</HI> and still worse at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> A great
shew of Devotion will naturalize a Man in <HI>Portugal,</HI>
but render him ridiculous in the Northern King∣doms.
A pleasant and merry Humor will spoil a
Man's business in <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but give him easy
access in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As for the knowledg of Tongues, besides that it
is impossible to acquire all a Man wants if he travel
any thing far, and that it will not do him all the
Service that is commonly imagin'd, if he has only a
mind to run through <HI>Europe,</HI> it is a great occasion of
the Corruption of Manners, by easily introducing
Men into places of Debauchery; and on the other
hand it has been observ'd, that it contributes very
little to the forming of the Mind: for besides that
it is not the common People that a Man ought to be
curious in consulting; and among Men of figure the
knowledg of their Language renders a Man ob∣noxious
to suspicion, 'tis sufficient that a Man can
speak any one Language that is know: As the
Italian Tongue is very common in <HI>Greece</HI> and the
Lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> besides the help one may have from
Interpreters, of whom there are great numbers for
all the living Tongues in <HI>Europe.</HI> And if you speak
a dead Language with any Native of a foreign
Country, he has no advantage above you; and if
you are better vers'd in it than he, he'll be sure to
<PB N="7" REF="140"/>
supply what he wants in Expression by the degree
of Knowledg, wherein he excels you in respect of
the matter about which you converse, and will give
you a greater insight into it in half an hour's Dis∣course,
than you should have obtain'd it may be in
twenty Visits, if you had made use of his Native
Language. 'Tis sufficient if you have Language
enough to make your self understood about your
necessary Affairs; and there are always People to
be found, who will make use of your Native Lan∣guage,
to discourse with you so as not to be under∣stood
by others, that they may learn something of
you that others don't know; and that they may
give you occasion to learn something of them which
you don't yet understand. But Curiosity ought to be
kept within the bounds of Patience and Discretion,
and that being suppos'd, there's scarce any thing
but a Man may be capable of it in Travelling; if
one can but add to the Conditions I have been men∣tioning
a lively and yet obsequious Fancy, and easy
and faithful Memory, a sweet and insinuating Hu∣mor,
a Curiosity that is not impatient, and an im∣partial
way of judging. These are the Qualities that
give a Man an easy and agreeable reception into all
Companies, and prepossess the People of any Na∣tion
with favourable thoughts of a Traveller who is
endow'd with 'em. These cut his Work short, re∣move
all Obstacles in the way of his acquaintance
with them, and bring them into such a familiarity
with him, as will be sure to engage their Confidence,
if he be but careful to observe himself, as well as
study the Temper of others. These are the Vehi∣cles
of Policy, which by discovering the Humor,
Inclinations and Genius of every Nation, insensibly
bring us to the knowledg of their Maxims, their
Reasons of State, their Designs, their Conduct and
various Sentiments. In a word, 'tis by the help of
<PB N="8" REF="141"/>
these Qualifications, that a Man becomes a <HI>Proteus</HI>
in foreign Countries, and knows how to transform
himself into the shape of others, and so to conceal
his own. And by consequence must needs reap ad∣vantage
by all the good he sees or hears, which is
agreeable to his Character, and the Capacity of his
Mind.</P>
<P>I say, he should have a lively, but obsequious Ima∣gination,
which may pass for a Paradox among such
as judg hastily, just as they feel their Fancies touch'd;
and supposing a lively Imagination can never be ob∣sequious
without losing its Vivacity at the same time,
will tell me I require an impossibility: 'tis there∣fore
convenient to undeceive 'em by a sensible Com∣parison.
When one that seeks for Game sees some∣thing
move in a Bush, his first motion is to put him∣self
in a posture to shoot; but if he discharges im∣mediately
without any further Observation, he may
well be counted rash, and his precipitancy will spoil
his Design: whereas if he has prudence and patience,
he'll observe what 'tis that stirs, and endeavour to
discover what Game may be in the Bush, which way
it came, and whither it goes, which gives him the
greater advantage to direct his Aim, so that his shot
can hardly miss. There's no Comparison can be
more just and applicable to the case in hand. A
Traveller that has a mind to make some Discoveries
in the Mysteries of State-Policy, is prying and ob∣serving
with an Activity like that of one who is
seeking after Game; every thing that appears more
than ordinary ought to strike his Mind so as to ex∣cite
his Attention: but nothing ought to determine
him but his Reason, and a due application of the
Principles of Policy; he should see and hear, and
take a measure of every thing, without imagining
he has got any thing till he has measur'd it with
that profound Discussion I have been commending.
<PB N="9" REF="141"/>
Statesmen are extremely crafty, and know how to
dodg with a Stranger, especially when they see in
him a great Vivacity and Eagerness to receive what
they tell him.</P>
<P>These Artifices are us'd in all Nations more or
less according to the degree of their Refinement and
Subtilty: Therefore the intelligent Traveller must
imitate the cunning Hunter, who sometimes makes
as if he did not see his Game, merely to surprize
it the more easily: He must make as if he did not
hear some things, and as if he understood much less,
and discover'd nothing at all; from whence one of
these two things must necessarily follow, either that
he will be suppos'd to be ignorant and stupid, which
will render him less suspected, and occasion a new
Explication of the matter discoursed of in more
open and intelligible terms; or else that the Per∣son
he converses with, will immediately give ano∣ther
turn to the Subject in hand by different Ex∣pressions,
and the variety of Terms cannot choose
but give some light into what he would conceal or
disguise.</P>
<P>He may also learn somewhat from the common
report of a Province or City, to inform him what is
the predominant Genius of a Nation, or of the Court
that governs it, only with this difference, that what
he is told of the Spirit of any Nation, is generally
and almost infallibly true; whereas the Idea that is
given of a Court is almost always false; so that
'twould be a kind of Miracle if ever it should
happen to be true. There is in the Voice of the
Publick a certain tract of Truth, Simplicity, In∣genuity
and Sincerity, which keeps the Multitude
either from being easily deceiv'd themselves, or
from deceiving others; and so much the more, be∣cause
(as <HI>Origen</HI> says) God, the first Cause of all
things, has reserv'd only this way to make an im∣pression
<PB N="10" REF="142"/>
of Truth on the Minds of the Populace, who
are not capable of any other discussion of things,
much less of refin'd Politicks; which gave occasion
to that wise saying, <HI>The Voice of the People is the
Voice of God.</HI> But the Court is another World,
where all things are compounded, and from whence
Simplicity, Candor, Sincerity, and oftentimes even
Justice and Truth are exil'd. And seeing the Men
of this World are different from others, 'tis not to
be wonder'd at if one is deceiv'd by their Disguises,
and if the warm Fancy of a young Man is every
day impos'd on by them: For every thing they do
is with design, and therefore 'tis no wonder that
there's double dealing in all Affairs, so that one
knows not where to have 'em. Hence it is that
those Authors that write Relations of the State of
Princes-Courts, are carried away with so many
Illusions: For the more account they make of that
certain knowledg they pretend to have of 'em, and
the more the Ministry see they depend upon it, the
more they vary in their discourse with such an Au∣thor,
to deprive him of the sight of what he aims
at, by embarassing his Mind with diversity of Me∣diums.</P>
<P>There's no Rock more dangerous to an intelligent
Traveller, than the popular Reports which a Prince's
Council either purposely spreads abroad, or suffers
to be divulg'd: There's no stress to be laid on such
Stories, and a Man ought to be careful not to suffer
himself to be surpriz'd by 'em. A wise Roman on
such an occasion one day said to me, <HI>Se questo fosse
véro, non to saprébbe il popolo.</HI> <Q>The Credit the Peo∣ple
give this Report may be enough to convince
you that there's no such matter at the Palace, but
that the business is either already finish'd, or else
'tis a stroke that is not resolv'd, and it may be
not thought on, for if it was either the one or the
<PB N="11" REF="142"/>
other, you may be sure the People would have
known nothing of it.</Q></P>
<P>However 'tis true, that common Reports as they
precaution the Fancy instead of instructing it, do
not fail to furnish a Traveller with such Notices, as
must needs turn to his account. These Reports
<HI>Salust</HI> very wisely calls, <HI>Experimenta Nationum, The
Trials of the People;</HI> for there is at least so much
probability in 'em, that they have some Principle
that gives rise to 'em, and that they have given
some colour to an End which a Court is willing to
hide by some specious means.</P>
<P>I confess the <HI>Italians</HI> excel all Christian Nations
in this method of Travelling; but the People of
the East infinitely out-do the <HI>Italians</HI> themselves:
and 'tis from the long Conversation I have had with
both, that I have receiv'd what Light I have in this
matter, especially the way of abating the heat of
Fancy, and preventing it from being transported
beyond due bounds by its Vivacity, in which the
Eastern People are inimitable; and 'tis a Quality
one can't behold in 'em without Astonishment.</P>
<P>But seeing a Fancy that is tractable and obedient
determines nothing, and what it discovers may as
well deceive it as inform it; it ought to commit the
discussion of all to the Judgment that so it may come
to a result: For this purpose the Judgment ought to
be sublime and clear, tho these two Qualities are
not so compatible as at the first glance they seem to
be: for the elevation of the Mind exposes it to
Mists and Clouds, tho clearness of thought is com∣mon
to an extensive Soul. The former is like the
tops of Mountains which reach to the Clouds, and
almost always seem cover'd with a Mist to them
that stand in the Plain. That is, to explain the
Similitude; That Genius which is naturally sub∣lime,
being less capable than others of stooping
<PB N="12" REF="143"/>
down to the many frivolous Circumstances which
concur to the discovery of the politick Spirit of a
Court, often happens to pass such a Judgment as is
not free from all Objections, or else his way of ex∣pression
is less clear and intelligible than that of
others. On the contrary, they that affect clearness
of Judgment creep on the ground as it were, still
following the natural extent of their Minds which
serves for a Line to direct their steps; and as with∣out
this they could never go directly to the end they
have in view, so by the help of it they do every
thing with a becoming Justness and Deliberation.</P>
<P>Happy are they whose Genius is both sublime and
extensive, for the elevation of their Minds shews
'em what Souls of an inferior Rank could never
have discover'd; and their extension serves to help
to render every thing present to 'em without con∣fusion,
because the elevation of their Minds gives
'em a prospect of every thing; so that they see both
distinctly, and as it were at one view, whatever
is necessary to direct 'em to make a right Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>To inculcate this matter the better, it may not
be amiss to make use of a Comparison. Suppose
three Men walking in the field together discover an
Object at a distance: one of 'em having observ'd
it, says 'tis a Cart going on the top of a Hill; ano∣ther
supposes it to be a Bush wav'd up and down by
the Wind; and the third is confident 'tis a Man on
horseback riding against the Wind. Now it being
naturally impossible for the same Object to be at
once a Cart, a Bush, and a Man on horseback, 'tis
most certain that at least two of the three are
mistaken in their Judgments; and if one of them
judges right, it must be he that considers with the
greatest force of thought all possible Motions of that
Object about which he has thought fit to make a
<PB N="13" REF="143"/>
Judgment. This discovery is not to be ascrib'd
precisely to the sense of seeing, since this is suppos'd
to be alike in all three; therefore the truth of this
Judgment must be attributed to the quality of his
Mind who has the best notices of the matter.</P>
<P>The application of this Comparison is easy: Tra∣vellers
often think they have discover'd every thing
that passes in a Court, those Enterprizes that are yet
only to be seen at a distance, and those Designs that
are still more remote; yet 'tis not possible that all
that make these Observations should have the same
elevation of Mind, and none but such as have a very
sublime and clear Judgment are capable of speaking
accuratly of what they have observ'd. Hence it is
that we see so many different accounts of foreign
Countries, and yet all of 'em publish'd for truth by
their respective Authors; and indeed they may be
so, but this in proportion to the Character of the
Minds of those who compos'd 'em in their Travels,
according to the Judgment they made of things.</P>
<P>If I had not read in the account of the Voyage to
<HI>Athens</HI> the History of one <HI>Hieros Damaskinos</HI> of <HI>Ca∣loyero,</HI>
with whom I had just such another interview
as the Author of that Relation says happen'd to
him, I would here give an account of it at large;
but shall now only add something which that Tra∣veller
seems not to have met withal. There were
three Gentlemen of different Countries and my self
one day discoursing with this illustrious <HI>Caloyer</HI> about
the Policy of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which each of us pretended
to look upon as barbarous and uncultivated, on pur∣pose
to give him an occasion to speak of it after such
a manner as might give us light into it. He told
us he had no skill in Policy either in general, or in
the use of it among the <HI>Turks;</HI> and that he made it
his business only to understand and explain the holy
Scripture to his Disciples of <HI>Athens:</HI> but he said if
<PB N="14" REF="144"/>
we would address our selves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> as to the
<HI>Vaivode</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> or any other Person of Note,
they would be sure to give us satisfaction in those
matters.</P>
<P>I remember I was the only Person in the company
that could not be perswaded that this <HI>Caloyer</HI> was
unacquainted with Politicks. A very ingenious <HI>Po∣lander</HI>
thought he was too much devoted to the study
of the Scripture to have any great matter of skill
in other things. A <HI>German</HI> that was of our com∣pany
took him for a Person only vers'd in the No∣tions
of the School-men, and capable of criticizing
on the holy Scripture: an <HI>Italian</HI> that was with us
maintain'd that as he was one of that remnant of
Greeks who seem to be the Posterity of the Peasants
of former times; he had not subtilty of mind
enough to penetrate into such Politicks as were as
burdensom to 'em as they appear'd violent and un∣reasonable.</P>
<P>We push'd our Curiosity yet further, and by good
luck a <HI>Sangiac</HI> who was upon his return from <HI>Candie</HI>
to the Port, and pass'd through <HI>Athens,</HI> was so kind
as to inform us of many things we had a mind to
know; and among other things told us there was no
Man in the World knew more of those matters
than this Grecian. It may easily be imagin'd I hug'd
my self for judging differently of this Man from the
rest of the company. And at last, after many earnest
Sollicitations, we engag'd this learned <HI>Caloyer</HI> to take
off the Mask, and shew us that he was under such a
serious disguise of Simplicity as would have deceiv'd
a thousand People.</P>
<P>To return from this Digression; I say, to judg
well of all that presents and strikes the Imagination
of a man in travelling into foreign Parts, whether
it concern Religion, Morals or Politicks, there's
need of both elevation and clearness in the Judg∣ment;
<PB N="15" REF="144"/>
that is to say, such a measure of both, as
may dispose things in so much order that they don't
perplex and confound the Minds of other Men, nor
produce any thing in 'em but Light. And this
Qualification is not to be acquir'd if a Man is not
born with a sutable disposition. It can't be well ex∣plain'd
but by Practice; however, to give some Idea
of it, it seems to me to consist in three things:
First, In laying the stress of one's Judgment on that
which makes the least appearance in an Intrigue or
Negotiation; for Policy being the Academy of Dis∣guise,
and an exercise of Craft and Subtilty, gene∣rally
that which appears least in a politick Obser∣vation
may pass for the most real and true part of
it. Secondly, In never counting any thing suffi∣ciently
explain'd to determine one's mind about it,
that so the unexpected sounding of some Circum∣stance
or other, that does not seem to be thought
of, may give one a discovery of somewhat of which
the Ministry of a Court perhaps is not aware. And
so much the more in as much as speculative Policy
being suppos'd impenetrable, and not beginning to
appear till 'tis going to be put in execution, 'tis in
the Circumstances of the Execution that you are
to seek the certain discovery of the Design. Third∣ly,
In the opposition of one thing to another; for
altho the means employ'd in any particular politick
Design may be absolutely alter'd from one day to
another, because there's no Medium always essential
to and inseparable from Policy, yet 'tis certain, con∣sidering
how Men are made, that 'tis probable the
Council of a Prince don't alter their common No∣tions,
nor take up Resolutions as contradictory one
to another as Black to White: and therefore the
Opposition an intelligent Traveller discovers in the
Affairs on which he is making observation, ought to
suspend his Judgment, and to oblige him to for∣bear
<PB N="16" REF="145"/>
determining his Opinion, till time give him
further light. The first of these Rules forms the
Judgment, and renders it solid; the second culti∣vates
and refines it; and the third advances it to
Perfection. The first is owing more to Nature than
Experience; the second depends as much on Expe∣rience
as on a Genius: and the third raises the
Mind to a consummate Prudence, which is the highest
pitch of politick Wisdom.</P>
<P>That Traveller who has not an elevation of Mind
capable of such Inventions as may out-wit another,
may make use of the second Character of a prudent
Mind, namely, to enquire much into things, and
determine but little about 'em; but if a Man wants
both the one and the other of these Qualities, we'll
venture to prophesy that he'll never become a Po∣litician.</P>
<P>The Memory in the judgment of many passes for
one of the most excellent Faculties of the Soul:
But few consider, that seeing it brings out nothing
but what has been committed to it before, when
there is Confusion in the Mind, there must also ne∣cessarily
be the like disorder in the Memory. 'Tis
a great advantage to a Traveller to have a Memo∣ry
easily impressible, provided it be faithful; for if
a Man because he has seen much, goes about to utter
a great deal without giving an intelligible account of
matters, by reason of that Confusion which the ama∣zing
diversity of Things, Names and Circumstances
ordinarily occasions, his Memory appears to be a
mere Labyrinth of Perplexity.</P>
<P>I have always look'd upon an easy Memory to be
like a handsome Face, which hides a great many
Infirmities in a crazy Body, and strikes the Fancy
more than all these Imperfections, tho they really
much out-balance it. For besides that such a Me∣mory
serves for a Rock for the Imagination to split
<PB N="17" REF="145"/>
on, and this becomes as dangerous to the Reason
and Judgment, supposing it not to be incompatible
with the regular exercise of either of these; yet
'tis most certain a great multiplicity of Facts require
either abundance of time to range 'em in good or∣der,
or a prodigious heat of Fancy to melt 'em
down (as it were) altogether, without making any
alteration in 'em. So that it seems an impossible
supposition, that an easy Memory can be strong and
true, so as not to divert from that steady Applica∣tion
which the Judgment requires.</P>
<P>And yet both are necessary for a Traveller, so
that one of these Qualities without the other would
be of no use to get the knowledg of the State-Resolutions
of any foreign Politicians: For if what
he learns to day is not supported with all those
Circumstances that may render it more than pro∣bable
to his discussion, and is not produc'd afresh in
all its Circumstances when any Affair that bears a
proportion to it presents, 'tis easy to conceive that
all the Circumstances that help'd him at first to de∣cide
the matter in hand being represented to him but
by halves, and in the room of those that are omit∣ted
others substituted which alter the state of the
case; 'tis not difficult, I say, to conceive that such
an easy Memory must cast him into confusion, be∣cause
it does not faithfully revive all those Cir∣cumstances.
This Conclusion may be set in a clearer∣light
by an Example.</P>
<P>The Visier <HI>Kara Mustapha</HI> who besieg'd <HI>Vienna</HI>
remember'd the Advice, and a great many of the
Projects Count <HI>Tekely</HI> had given him in his Tent at
their enterview beyond <HI>Buda</HI> before this great En∣terprize:
And his Memory reproduc'd that in his
extremity, which his Pride had made him despise.
The Count perswaded him to possess himself of the
Bridges of <HI>Vienna</HI> on the North-side before he made
<PB N="18" REF="146"/>
a formal Siege, presuming that by this means he
would either block up the late Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>
with his Troops in <HI>Leopalstat,</HI> or oblige him to quit
it with the more speed, and a greater number of his
Men, which would make the Circumvallation more
easy, and the Garison probably less numerous, or
else the Duke would expose himself to be first routed
in the field▪ and never was any Advice more wisely
given, or more rashly contemn'd.</P>
<P>When this Visier was mortified by the Resistance
of the Besieged, and resolv'd to attempt any thing
to repair the damage he had sustain'd, and the time
he had lost in this Siege, he was willing to have re∣course
to Count <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Counsel, and would needs
endeavour to be master of those Bridges, without
considering the difference of Time and other Cir∣cumstances;
he gave his Orders for the execution
of this Design, but instead of depriving <HI>Vienna</HI> of
good part of its Garison, or of weakening those
Succors which the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> manag'd so
long, and to so good purpose against him, as he
might certainly have done in the former Juncture,
he diminish'd his own Force, and sent his Troops to
be cut in pieces without being able to execute the
Orders they had receiv'd.</P>
<P>By this one may judg that an easy Memory is al∣ways
dangerous when 'tis unfaithful; tho I confess
'tis less so in the speculation of a Traveller than in
the conduct of a Statesman, who ought from the
very first step he takes to distrust it more than de∣pend
on it. Memory is a great help at the Bar, and
in the Pulpit, but 'tis the least Qualification of a
Statesman. 'Tis by reading (which is a kind of
Travelling) and by Travelling (which is a living
sort of reading) that a Man is to be convinc'd of
this Truth, that an easy Memory being usually
treacherous when 'tis over-charg'd with many things
<PB N="19" REF="146"/>
that have no mutual connexion, nothing is to be
omitted that may render it less easy and more
faithful.</P>
<P>I think I have observ'd by Experience three Rules
that contribute much to reduce the Memory to this
state, which is certainly no easy matter to accom∣plish.
The first is, for a Man to learn well the chief
foreign things about which he has a mind to employ
his Memory, without troubling himself to retain the
proper Names of Places, Persons and Times, of
which Gazetteers seldom fail to give a very particu∣lar
account for the information of the Curious, be∣cause
'tis their province to know things of this
kind. The second is, To join that which one de∣sires
to know, to what one knows already by some
<HI>Epocha</HI> of Facts, Times, or Conjunctures, which re∣semble
and refer one to another; as, for instance,
to join to the raising the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> the politick
Proposition made by the King of <HI>Poland</HI> for his
eldest Son to be married to the Archdutchess as his
Reward for relieving that City. The third is, to
unite and accommodate both the one and the other
to the Circumstances and actual Conduct of the
Country where a Man is at present, or whither he
is to return; because what passes there can't easily
escape the Mind, being often reviv'd by the Memo∣ry,
and therefore that which has been link'd to it
will also be retain'd, and the Memory render'd faith∣ful
to such a degree, that all things will be easily re∣collected.</P>
<P>I say a Man ought in the first place thorowly to
possess his Mind with the first discoveries he makes
in his Travels; that is to say, after he has made a
deep search into the Precepts of Policy (without
which nothing is to be expected of him) to look on
every side upon that which first strikes his Mind in a
manner different from the Prejudices he has brought
<PB N="20" REF="147"/>
out of his own Country, that so he may object a∣gainst
his own Prepossession all those Reasons that
he imputes to the Prejudices of others, which is fit
to be demonstrated by an Example.</P>
<P>A French Man that goes to <HI>Rome</HI> furnish'd with
many Advantages and Recommendations that give
him access to Persons of Quality, is presently loaded
with Civilities, without being taken into that kind
of Familiarity with them, which is so agreeable to
his Humor: This makes him impatient, and it seems
no small Punishment to him to continue six weeks
at <HI>Rome,</HI> to live all the while in an Inn: But at
length the Reasons of this kind of Treatment are
open'd to him, and he comes to understand that the
<HI>Italian</HI> loving Splendor tho he is not rich, and af∣fecting
to be liberal without incommoding himself,
waits to regale him after a magnificent manner and
in good company, when he finds a proper time for
it, and then his Splendor, Profusion and Magnifi∣cence
will appear at once. He must therefore ex∣amine
all the Reasons of this kind of Conduct; and
by opposing this liberty the <HI>Italians</HI> reserve to them∣selves,
to the ordinary profuseness of that Nation,
he'll be convinc'd that they do well at <HI>Rome</HI> not to
live in that familiarity he so much desir'd. These
Discoveries will be serviceable to him at <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI>
and he'll appear a knowing Man in other places
in proportion to the faithfulness of his Memory in
reviving the Reasons, and different respects that
have determin'd him at <HI>Rome.</HI> This is what I call
a thorow possessing of the Mind with that which
one desires to commit to Memory.</P>
<P>The second method is, to join things together by
some <HI>Epocha</HI> that is remarkable, and not easy to be
chang'd. This Connexion is like a Guide always
going before the Judgment with a light in his hand,
so that he seldom mistakes his way who is conducted
<PB N="21" REF="147"/>
by it. The <HI>Epocha</HI> contributes much to the fidelity
of the Memory, and the things being allied toge∣ther
by a proper reference and proportion, 'tis al∣most
impossible that the revival of 'em in the Me∣mory
should not be exact and true.</P>
<P>The reason of which is not from the nature of
those Incidents which accidentally happen to be
link'd together, but from the immediate applica∣tion
of the Mind, which because it omits nothing
that may give it a deep impression of a thing, can't
see two different Circumstances which concur to the
same Fact, without making a certain fix'd Point, as
well for the Time, as other Conjunctures: 'Tis this
that has occasion'd so many Digressions in antient
Historians, who have not been able to resist that
natural Inclination of shewing in the same Treatise,
what they had observ'd at the same time, and by
the same discoveries.</P>
<P>In fine, the third method of rendering the Me∣mory
faithful is, to reunite the Notices one receives,
and the Conjunctures that present, to what actually
passes in one's own Country; because the revival
of what is acted there must needs be frequent and
of long duration, and a Man's mind will necessarily
be concern'd about it; and seeing this obliges a
Man to join to his present Observations, that which
pass'd in his own Country when he was there, he
is as it were tied fast to the Circumstances of things
so that he cannot easily mistake 'em, but is necessa∣rily
oblig'd to revive 'em in his mind. 'Tis true,
there must be strength of Thought, Labor and Time
to reunite these things after long Voyages, especi∣ally
if our Traveller has not had much correspon∣dence
with his own Country: But Experience every
day shews that 'tis no impossible thing.</P>
<P>This is, in my opinion, the innocent Art of ren∣dering
an easy Memory faithful; let us now pass
<PB N="22" REF="148"/>
to the other Qualifications of a Traveller.</P>
<P>It has been said that he ought to have a sweet and
insinuating Humor, not by a study'd composing of
himself, which will soon betray him when he tarries
long in a place, but by a docility of Mind, which
makes a Man as it were naturally comply with things
that one would think must needs shock him, to judg
of him by the gust of his Country. 'Tis this
sweetness of temper which becomes Affability in
those who are in public Posts, but in Travellers it
should always be Condescension, without degene∣rating
into a servile weakness of Mind: And they
ought to have the art of using this Condescension
after an advantageous manner, so as to engage those
with whom they converse, either to confide in 'em,
or to inform 'em. Suppose, for instance, that one
happens to be with an English-man who boasts of
his own Nation, in respect of its Strength, Courage,
Trade, Plenty and Independence; and scarce ever
speaks of a French-man, an Italian, or a German,
without contempt; a Traveller who has docility,
and yet firmness of Mind, will in sincere terms give
his Suffrage to applaud what is good in the English
Nation, and in their Polities, without undertaking
to make comparisons between Nation and Nation,
or so much as between Man and Man, which ought
to be industriously avoided; because there are al∣ways
in foreign Countries some Persons that go un∣der
a disguise, whose Genius, Country, Interest and
Designs, can scarce ever be discover'd, but yet by
this means may be won upon. In observing this
Conduct, our Traveller would not fail to attract the
Confidence of such an English-man, and so might
get out of him why the English Nation is so fickle
and unsteady in the midst of all its Prosperity, why
they are so eager after Gain amidst so great Riches,
and why they are so unfit for long Enterprizes and
<PB N="23" REF="148"/>
tedious Conquests, tho they have such good Armies
and Fleets. In a word, he'd learn more of this
English-man in three days, than he could perhaps
in reading all the Historians that have written of
that Country.</P>
<P>But to give the Demonstration of this, when ever
any thing flatters and pleases a Man to such a degree
as to make him despise what does not seem to bear a
proportion to it, either he is a Fool, or under a dis∣guise,
or an intelligent Man set upon his own Inte∣rest,
and over-zealous for it. If the first, a wise
Traveller will easily discover him, and contemn
him, without troubling himself to talk with him.
If the second, he'll make trial of him by the Rules
I have been laying down; so that this Man under a
Mask shall not be able to proceed far without being
either reduc'd to silence, or else betraying himself.
If the last, he can't be a man of Knowledg but by
the universal Principles of Policy, in which he has
no advantage above our Traveller, or else by such
particular Decisions he has made as are proper to
his Country; and in this point he excites all the
Curiosity of our Traveller, who for his own satis∣faction
must apply himself to receive Instruction
with all that nice Complaisance which we have been
already supposing; he must hearken, applaud, and
enquire: for Attention and Applause always pro∣cure
the Esteem and Confidence of him that speaks;
and a sweet, ingenuous and modest way of inquiring
always returns with some discoveries; Experience
shews that it never fails to get some degrees of
knowledg out of those upon whom 'tis duly tried.
The Information I have receiv'd even from a Ser∣vant
as it were by accident, of a Visit made by a
certain Person to his Master, has furnish'd me
with the first occasion of diving into an Affair, of
which I had not the least thought, and the disco∣very
<PB N="24" REF="149"/>
very of which gave me that satisfaction which is a∣greeable
to one that travels for his Information.</P>
<P>But to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> this Effect the more certain; to this
quality one ought to add a Curiosity that is not im∣patient.
Curiosity is needful in travelling, but then
it ought not to be too brisk and lively, that one
may the better dissemble the Motives of it, and
cover 'em with the usual pretexts of such a vain
Curiosity as only applies it self to the description
of Churches, Palaces, Gardens, Fortifications, and
the detail of such Counsels and Circumstances as
the meanest Servants of a Court always understand,
as well as those that compose Historical Relations.
There must be Curiosity to mitigate the uneasiness
and difficulty a man must be sure to meet with in
accommodating one's way of Living, Habit and
Manners, to the Custom of Countries so unlike one's
own: for seeing Self-love hath more pressing Rea∣sons
when it deprives it self of what is pleasing to it,
to expose it self to that to which it has an aversion;
'tis necessary that it be requited for quitting what it
so naturally likes, by some other satisfaction which
the Fancy has the art to represent as greater, more
rare, and more durable; without which there's no
probable ground to expect a Man should travel with
delight, and 'twould be an unadvised thing to at∣tempt
it. For to suppose that all those advantages
a Man may make use of in Travelling will excuse
him from all kind of uneasiness, is to please one's
self with a mere Delusion, especially when a Man
goes out of the Christian part of <HI>Europe.</HI> Curiosity
therefore must serve instead of all other Pleasure to
make amends for the Expence and Uneasiness to
which our Traveller is expos'd.</P>
<P>This Curiosity deprives it self of what it designs
to obtain, when it once appears to be impatient,
and it really is impatient when ever it appears to
<PB N="25" REF="149"/>
be so. Men of all Countries in the World are
fram'd after such a manner, that no Man is willing
to oblige another to his own disadvantage; and the
most grateful and officious Person that can be will
never give an occasion of getting an advantage over
him by what he discovers. All that observe a Tra∣veller
have in this respect the same impression; eve∣ry
body suspects that Man to have some special de∣sign,
who leaves his Family and his Country to ex∣pose
himself to Sickness and other Dangers and In∣conveniences,
which are inevitable. They that sup∣pose
he has only a sensual Curiosity are always in∣dulgent
enough to satisfy him in that respect, be∣cause
self-love obliges a Man to discover whatever
is curious in his own Country to a Stranger: but it
being another sort of Traveller that I have been
supposing, namely, one who seeks to get an insight
into State-Policy; the chief Advice I would give
him, is not to devest himself of Curiosity (for that
would be unreasonable) but not to be impatient in
seeking to give it satisfaction.</P>
<P>Impatience is the daughter of Desire, and this
if it be reasonable, must be the production of the
Judgment, which will fully convince a Man that
whatever sets him at a greater distance from the
end he has in view, can't be proper to lead him to
it. Now Impatience will infallibly set our Tra∣veller
at a greater distance from the End he pro∣poses,
and consequently cannot be fit to promote
the Pleasure he expects from it. But to make it
the better understood how and why Impatience re∣tards
the satisfaction of the Curiosity, one need on∣ly
observe that it produces such precaution in the
Minds of those with whom a Traveller converses,
as becomes a kind of Partition-wall, that he must
either pierce through or break down before he can
discover what is acted on the other side of it. The
<PB N="26" REF="150"/>
more importunate a Man of understanding perceives
a Stranger to be to get information, the less willing
he is to satisfy him, and keeps the greater guard
on himself not to gratify his desire till he is as it
were necessitated to do it, and has learn'd something
of this Traveller that may oblige him to it. This
Obstacle is so great that one must not think either of
slighting it, or of overcoming it without a conside∣rable
space of time, and a great deal of manage∣ment.
If a Man presumes to do the former, he'll
find every body prejudic'd against him, when the
Person he has slighted comes to explain himself after
a manner that is disadvantageous to him: and if he
depends on the latter course, he engages himself in
a great Charge with more than a moral uncertainty
of succeeding in his Design.</P>
<P>Would it not therefore be much better for our
Traveller to appear free and easy in the presence of
such Persons, that they may not become so cautious,
but may attribute that only to his Curiosity which
by his Impatience he'll give 'em occasion to impute
to a desire of knowing the present state of the Go∣vernment
in which they are concern'd? And on
this head it will not be improper to alledg an Ex∣ample
of which I have been a witness my self. I
happen'd to be in a certain foreign Court, where
there was a Dutch-man who had a great deal of
Wit, and made too great an appearance not to be
suspected; this Person desir'd Audience of one of
the principal Ministers of State, who in conversa∣tion
making use of that right which his Rank and
Authority gave him, ask'd him, <HI>What was the Mo∣tive
of his Travels?</HI> The Dutch-man thinking to
make his Court to him, answer'd, that <HI>it was to
learn of him as well as by the Example of other Persons
of his figure, to understand the Government of a State.</HI>
The Minister coldly replied, <HI>You had need of a great
<PB N="27" REF="150"/>
deal of time, and a ripeness of Age to succeed in a business
of this nature.</HI> To which this Stranger made this
foolish return, <HI>My Curiosity</HI> (says he) <HI>and impatience
after Knowledg may abridg both the one and the other.</HI>
At this Answer the Statesman rose up and left him,
with these words, <HI>For my part, Sir, I perceive I shall
contribute nothing to either.</HI> And the Dutch-man was
driven to despair to find himself suspected by a
Minister of State, who had receiv'd him with affa∣bility,
and now look'd upon him as a Man of no
sense.</P>
<P>Needs any more to be said to shew that Curiosity,
which is suppos'd necessary to a Traveller, ought
not to be impatient? But for this end there's need
of a great deal of judgment, and a good faculty
of discerning the Humor of Nations, and the Tem∣per
of particular Mens Minds, which is a Talent
that one can't communicate to any Man.</P>
<P>After all it is not impossible not to be impatient
to learn what one goes so far to seek: for as our
Traveller has not assign'd his Voyages a precise
space of time, much less does he pretend to pre∣scribe
Laws to foreign Nations; 'tis his business to
accommodate the extent of his Curiosity to the
measure of his Capacity, and to proportion the
effects of it to the good success he has had in fo∣reign
Discoveries: All Occasions, Seasons and Con∣junctures
are not equally proper for this purpose.
There are some States in which nothing at all
is to be learn'd during the time of War, and
others wherein one can get no information but in
such a time. In one place Peace is an Obstacle to
politick Discoveries, in another War shuts up all
the Avenues to the confidence of particular Persons.
There are some Ministers under whose Conduct Men
dare not speak, and others under whose Govern∣ment
people say any thing. Hence it is that some
<PB N="28" REF="151"/>
Travellers learn more than others, tho perhaps they
are Persons of like Ability and Curiosity. And if
I may be permitted to add my Opinion, I shall not
scruple to say, that a Man ought to travel at several
times and occasions to the same Court, to be well
assur'd of Improvement, and that he has penetrated
into the Maxims and Conduct of it.</P>
<P>Let any one judg after this, whether Impatience is
not an invincible Obstacle to Curiosity, and how
great a disadvantage they must be under, whose too
great Vivacity precipitates 'em, and whose warm
Temper exposes 'em rather to the Censure than
procures 'em the Confidence of foreign Nations.</P>
<P>'Tis still much worse when a Man has not such
a politick undetermin'd posture of Mind as to act
with impartiality, and not to shew any prejudice or
a strong inclination to the Maxims of his own
Country on the one hand, and on the other hand
an indifference for those of others. And this being
the great and indeed the original fault that Men
carry into other Countries, one can't too much ar∣gue
against it, and shew the danger of it.</P>
<P>Universal Reason, which is the foundation of
Policy, directs that a Man of Honor part from his
own Country undetermin'd in his Mind, that is, so
dispos'd to learn of all Men according to the fore∣mention'd
Passage of the wise Man; <HI>Bona enim &amp;
mala ex hominibus tentabit; He shall try what is good
and evil among Men:</HI> That he may appear docile
to every Man, and receive any one courteously who
is willing to give him any Information. 'Tis not
only useless but dangerous to travel without this
disposition; for the diversity of Minds one meets
with being the only remedy against Prejudice, an
inconsiderate and heady Traveller often ruins his
Health, as well as corrupts his Reason, by every
thing which might otherwise improve the one and
<PB N="29" REF="151"/>
restore the other. 'Twas this that made the late
Elector Palatine say, <HI>That Man is a fool that goes out
of his own Country without hopes of returning with
more Honor, Wisdom and Knowledg than what he carried
abroad.</HI></P>
<P>This disposition being suppos'd will be followed
by another, and that is, that a wise Traveller will
never return undetermin'd in his Mind, as he was
when he went out: But fully convinc'd what is the
greatest and most solid Advantage, with which he
has had the address to form his Mind in proportion
to the Capacity he has had of casting abundance
of differing matters together, only to extract out
of 'em what might contribute to his improvement in
Knowledg.</P>
<P>This temper of Mind is more easily spoken of
than found; for the Mind must be moulded after
an extraordinary manner to be capable of that do∣cility
which places a Man at the feet of others to
learn their Instructions; and 'tis next to a Miracle
to find a Genius of this Character, which is fix'd
and solid enough to come to a determination in the
midst of such a prodigious number of Maxims
which all result from Reason as their Principle, tho
the Effects they produce appear so opposite one to
another. And again there is danger lest this do∣cility
with which a Man prepares himself in going
abroad, should degenerate into Irresolution, Easiness,
and servile Complaisance at his return. That which
is to be seen in the greatest part of those who are
willing to make too deep and prying a search into
matters of Religion in prejudice to the establish'd
Systems, who often by their too curious Enquiries
are brought at last to sit loose from all Religion, and
die in this irresolution of Mind, often happens to
those middle-witted Persons whose Minds are tracta∣ble
in appearance, but weak in reality, so that by
<PB N="30" REF="152"/>
the very prospect of the many different Maxims of
Government, they become uncapable of governing;
because their Minds are not endow'd with a vigor
and heat sufficient to melt down all such matters
together, and to extract out of 'em only what pre∣cisely
sutes with the Government of the Country in
which they live.</P>
<P>One may every day see not only a great many
Travellers, but even Ministers of State and Am∣bassadors,
whose Minds are so fram'd, that their
Heads turn round instead of becoming firm and sta∣ble
at the appearance of so many different Circum∣stances
and Measures. On which account the old
Prince <HI>Lubomirski</HI> was wont to say, that <HI>such sort of
Men are sent abroad to learn the art of being regular
Fools.</HI> Indeed such Persons appear so little furnished
with the general Ideas of Policy, and so deeply
preposses'd with the particular Maxims of their
own Country, that their Weakness is discover'd
almost as soon as they begin to talk.</P>
<P>To speak yet more plainly for the good of the
publick, 'tis Ignorance that determines the Judg∣ments
of some Travellers; even before the Maxims
of foreign Countries are known to 'em, they go from
home so full of Prejudice, that they are resolv'd to
return possess'd with greater Opiniatrety than when
they went out: whence it comes to pass either that
they can learn nothing because of their prevention,
or else they see and observe so much that they can
come to no decisive Judgment, like those who have
more Victuals in their Stomachs than they have natu∣ral
heat to digest. To this purpose the late Prince
<HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> us'd to say; <HI>If these Travellers
would learn with a design of improving in Knowledg,
they would act becomingly; but to presume they know every
thing, before they are capable of learning, is the way to be∣come
a distinguish'd Fop.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="152"/>
And Ignorance in this matter contains in it three
respects, which the greatest part of the World does
not sufficiently consider, at least they seldom or ne∣ver
unite 'em all together. The first regards the
Principles of universal Policy; which Persons of or∣dinary
Parts almost perpetually confound with the
actual Determinations of the Government of their
Country. 'Tis true, there are every where some
Minds more sublime and judicious, who go to the
bottom of things, and seek out means of repairing
the Defects of the Politicks of their Country: but
it generally so happens that Persons of this Genius
are seldom advanc'd into favor, and meet with ve∣ry
little Respect in a State; whether it be that they
want Docility to accommodate themselves to the
Humors of others, or Submission to procure them
Patrons, or Ambition to push 'em forward. It was
of this sort of Men that the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> once
said, <HI>They were of the same use to States, as Props to
old Houses to hinder their fall.</HI></P>
<P>The second sort of Ignorance respects Persons of
another Genius, who surpassing the former as well
in Number as Authority, are in possession of the
privilege of setting a value upon things, and giving
weight to Decisions that are made: and hence it al∣most
necessarily comes to pass, that that is suppos'd
to be best and truest, which appears to be most au∣thoriz'd,
and most generally receiv'd. And this
Mistake is almost irreparable, if we take the mat∣ter
in general, in as much as the number of just and
sublime Minds being every where very small, and
that of narrow Capacities almost immense in pro∣portion
to the other; there is between both a sort
of middle-siz'd Understandings, to whose Decision
those of a subordinate Rank pay a blind deference,
which produces that publick Impression which ob∣tains
on the generality of People, that such as fill
<PB N="32" REF="153"/>
the first places in any Government, are ordinarily
the wisest and ablest Men. This popular Opinion
is often heard without contradiction, and this si∣lence
encreases the number of the Suffrages that are
given 'em, by which means People are confirm'd
and rivetted in their Ignorance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> with some appearance of Reason va∣lue
themselves upon their scrupulous care of avoid∣ing
the first of these Instances of National Igno∣rance;
because they indeed apply themselves more
than any other Nation to dive into the Principles
and special Uses of universal Policy: And we de∣sign
hereafter to shew what is their Motive, and how
it is supported, in a Treatise of the Politic Genius
of the United Provinces. But they have too little
firmness to keep 'em from falling into the second
Error, which will always mightily check the Projects
they lay in particular Determinations.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> very stupidly fall
into all the faults of the first Mistake by their negli∣gence
and contempt of the Principles of Universal
Policy, which they seem not to know, but only so as
to appropriate them to themselves without any di∣stinction
of Actions, Persons, Interests and Obsta∣cles,
which foils 'em at every turn, and defeats 'em
in all Treaties. But they preserve among 'em the
liberty of speaking with firmness of Mind about
public Affairs against the second Instance of Natio∣nal
Ignorance: and therefore the Duke of <HI>Holstein
Ploen</HI> said one day at <HI>Vienna</HI> with a great deal of soli∣dity;
<HI>By the first course the</HI> Dutch <HI>will support themselves
a great while, but never advance very far: Whereas the</HI>
Spaniards <HI>have enough to do to sustain themselves by
reason of the actual weakness of their present Situation;
but if ever they come to recover themselves, they can't
fail of making a very great advance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="153"/>
The third respect of this National Ignorance
proceeds from the Indisposition Men are in to know
others, by reason of the little sincerity and appli∣cation
they use to get the knowledg of themselves,
which betrays 'em into frequent Mistakes, and oc∣casions
'em to take the Faults of a Nation for the
Genius of it, and the Art of augmenting those
Faults (instead of mending 'em) for Motives of
governing it. Nay more than this, Men are wil∣ling
to misunderstand their own Properties which
might be cultivated, and by that means neglect the
Remedies by which they might continually rectify
them.</P>
<P>Perhaps these Metaphysical Abstractions will not
sute every body's Palat; but I have already de∣clar'd
that I speak in general without making a
particular application of things, and am unwilling
to offend any one. However 'tis certain that every
Nation has its faults, its singular qualities, its bright
and dark sides; and if an Instance of this be de∣sir'd,
the love of Riches will one time or other
ruin the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but the indefatigable Industry they
are capable of to acquire Wealth, will be their
support a long time. Ambition is a fault in the
<HI>French,</HI> which may run to dangerous Extremes; but
their Valor and Activity will serve a great while
to sustain 'em.</P>
<P>To avoid being ignorant of any thing that relates
to this, both these are to be throughly consider'd,
and exactly balanc'd one against the other; and a
Man ought to be convinc'd by himself which side
has the greatest weight, either to do the most
Mischief, or procure the most Good. But in good
earnest do Men usually begin their Voyages with
such a preliminary Knowledg as this? And yet less
than this will not suffice to travel to any pur∣pose;
and for want of this Discussion, Men carry
<PB N="34" REF="154"/>
nothing but Ignorance with them into Foreign
Courts.</P>
<P>I could advance a great deal on this Head, but
shall produce only two Examples, which may serve
to instruct others, and 'tis in what I have been a Wit∣ness
my self.</P>
<P><HI>A certain Gentleman that made a good Appea∣rance,
and had very great Recommendations (a
fatal help in a Foreign Court when a Man has not
the art of supporting them well by his own Conduct)
was ask'd by a Minister of State, What was the oc∣casion
of his Travels, because he seem'd to be of a
weak Constitution, and considerably advanc'd in
Years, and therefore probably had some particular
design in view. The Gentleman ingenuously an∣swer'd:</HI>
Sir, I travel to acquaint my self with <HI>Europe,</HI>
and to take occasion hereafter to make my own Country
acquainted with it. <HI>The Minister replied;</HI> If the
Pencil that is to draw your Picture of <HI>Europe</HI> is like that
with which you describe your own Country, there will be
more Fancy than Truth in your Originals. Sir, I can
scarce believe <HI>(return'd the Gentleman)</HI> that there are
any more perfect ones than those I have left in my own
Country. <HI>Upon which the Minister rose up and said,</HI>
Sir, you seem to me to be rather struck with one certain
Impression than to have a true knowledg of things; you'll
judg of us by that in which you most excel: Have a care
that you be not judg'd of here by that in which you are most
deficient.</P>
<P>This Stranger was cast into so great a perplexity,
when he compar'd this Answer with the first Com∣pliments
of Esteem for his Country, and for the Re∣commendations
he brought from thence, that he was
quite nonplus'd. And tho he would several times
fain have recover'd himself, and endeavor'd by
great Expence, Industry and Conversation with in∣genious
Men to inform himself better than he had
<PB N="35" REF="154"/>
done; all signified nothing but to give occasion to
have it said to him at the end of eighteen Months,
<HI>Sir, you had need to come and consult us; you see a
Man learns much if he knows but little when he leaves his
own Country; and that he has made no small advantage,
who has acquir'd by his Travels the art of Learning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The second Instance is of one who was sent with
the Charge of a Negotiation to a Court, where he
had Orders to tarry only so long as was necessary to
perform his Duty, and to wait for an Answer. He
came and lodg'd in a Publick House, where he was
complimented on the part of the Chief Minister by
an Abbot, who found him ready to sit down at
Table, very much displeas'd at the way of dressing
the Victuals which was prepar'd according to the
gust of the Country: After the first Compliments
were past, this Envoy could not help saying,</HI> What
sort of a Country have you here, Sir? Here is not so
good eating as in other places where I have been, and
nothing near so good as at my own Table. Sir, <HI>(said
the Abbot)</HI> Men reason here as they ought to do, but
do not much trouble their heads about the art of Cookery;
that they leave to other Nations to carry to the highest
pitch of Perfection they please. What <HI>(reply'd the
Envoy)</HI> can there be just reasoning in a Country where
every thing seems out of order <HI>At which the Abbot
rose up and said,</HI> You shall judg of our Country (if
you please) by your selves; and we'll refer our selves
in this matter to your Opinion, provided you don't pre∣tend
to subject ours to your pleasure.</P>
<P>By the recital of this foolish Discourse of the
Envoy, the Minister of State had a sufficient disco∣very
of his Character: the day following he came
to his Audience, where nothing was discours'd but
State-Affairs; and as he was going out, says the
Minister in a tone of Railery: <HI>Be sure to get a good
Dinner, Sir, and pray order your matters so as to dine
<PB N="36" REF="155"/>
with me to morrow.</HI> The Envoy did not fail to
come, and opposite to him was plac'd one of those
secret Censors, who penetrate a Man as soon as he
begins to open his Mouth, without regard to his
Office, of which they never speak directly or in∣directly.
He was magnificently regal'd, and at
the time when the Table allows a liberty of free
Discourse; <HI>Well Sir,</HI> says this Censor, <HI>how d'ye
like this Country? There's nothing but Magnificence</HI>
(says the Envoy) <HI>every where, but yet here's one thing
wanting:</HI> to which the other wittily reply'd; <HI>If it
be nothing but your Approbation, we can do well enough
without it.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed this Envoy was not long enough at this
Court to improve himself by it: for when he left
it he was so entirely displeas'd with it, that by
signifying his Disgust, he gave occasion to 'em to
let him know a thousand ways, that they were
every jot as much disgusted with him. At his re∣turn
he made a ridiculous Description of this Court:
but Men had need take care what they say, for
there happen'd to be a Stranger in the company
who made this disdainful Reply: <HI>If your own Coun∣try</HI>
(said he) <HI>could not furnish you with common
Sense, how could you expect that a Court which you
did but just pass through should teach you what you had
no disposition to learn?</HI> This Repartee was carried
to that Court of which this Envoy had given so
unsutable a Character, and 'tis certain he a long
time pass'd there for the greatest Fool that ever was
honour'd with a public Employ: These are the
Effects of Ignorance, and a sottish Prejudice.</P>
<P>That is never to be learn'd in Travelling which
'tis suppos'd a well-bred Man ought to know be∣fore
he engages in Travels. For the Principles
of Society and Policy are so link'd together, that
he that transgresses the former, renders himself ri∣diculous
<PB N="37" REF="155"/>
when he speaks, to signify some unjust Pre∣ference
that he makes in it.</P>
<P>The confounding of a personal Determination
of a Minister of State, together with a National
Determination, is a second Stumbling-block, against
which the greatest part of inconsiderate and raw
Travellers break their Shins: Who when they are
spoken to about the actual Symptoms of the Go∣vernment
of their Country, on purpose to put 'em
upon discoursing, if instead of intimating by a wise
Reply, that they know how to distinguish the In∣terests
and Designs of their Country from the
personal Motives of those who govern it, which
on that account determine them otherwise, they
confound them both together, they pass for Fools,
and mere Butterflies, that always flutter about that
which casts the greatest Light. And after a Man
has once made such a false step, let him try as
long as he pleases, he'll find it impossible to set
himself right again in the Esteem of Men of sense,
Railery will take its turn after serious Discourse;
and the greater Expence he shall be at to intro∣duce
himself into good Company, the more ridi∣culous
will he appear to 'em. And if you tell
these stupid Creatures, or (if you please) these
pretended Politicians, that they err in the first
Principles of Policy, they'll treat you as a ridi∣culous
and whimsical Person; nay some of 'em
have been so ill-temper'd as to endeavour to render
a Man suspected, for having had respect and kind∣ness
enough for his Country to advertise 'em of
their Mistake.</P>
<P>The Faults of every Nation are known in all
foreign Countries: Nay they compose divers Axi∣oms
of 'em, which are not altogether false; for
after all, if they are not all of 'em absolutely true,
there's something in 'em infallibly so. And whe∣ther
<PB N="38" REF="156"/>
it be Prejudice or Time that has given Au∣thority
to this sort of Proverbs, 'tis certain who∣ever
shocks 'em, goes for an extravagant Man.</P>
<P>The Art of Travelling teaches a Man to keep
his equal distance from the Extremities of wholly
denying, or wholly confessing such National Faults.
For 'tis equally dangerous to err on either hand,
which very few Persons consider: He that denies a
Fault that is imputed to his Country, pulls an old
House upon his head in irritating the People among
whom he resides at present, which must needs be a
great piece of Imprudence. Nor is that Traveller
much wiser who falls into the other Extreme, that
is, coldly and tamely to grant every Story that is
impos'd on his Country; for tho he should capti∣vate
some vulgar Minds by this Air of Sincerity,
he'll be sure to get the Reputation of a Fop among
Persons of Note. 'Tis still worse when a Traveller
grants that with which his Country is reproach'd,
only to take his turn immediately to twit that
Nation where he is thus attack'd with that Fault
which is imputed to it in our Traveller's Country;
for this is to insult over People at their own home,
and therefore can't choose but irritate 'em. And
the wisest Men will disapprove of any man's coming
into a Country to reproach it with a Fault, which
'tis always asham'd to be thought to have, and
perfectly hates to hear laid to its charge. What
then must a Man do in this case? Why that which
no body will ever teach you, if you neglect to
learn it before you leave your own Country; And
that is, to study well the Defects and Virtues
of your Country by setting 'em in opposition one
to the other, that so you may oppose 'em when
occasion requires to what is imputed to you, and
may speak of the one, without signifying any thing
for or against the others, by entering into a parti∣cular
<PB N="39" REF="156"/>
Examination and Confutation of 'em. By
this Conduct you'l pass in Foreign Nations for a wise
Man, by this means your Capacity will be known,
and you'l be consider'd and esteem'd in proportion
to the Knowledg you appear to have, and to the
Advantage others may have of learning by you
to become acquainted with a Nation which perhaps
they never design to see. And since one Story
draws out another, that which you give concerning
your Country will infallibly procure you the know∣ledg
of the Nation where you are; and by this
Address you'll easily get a solid understanding of
what you came to seek, namely, the discovery of
the Genius, Policy, and Manners of a whole Nation.
This is the Product of Skill in the Art of Travelling.
I'll give one Instance which formerly touch'd me
very sensibly. A certain <HI>Italian</HI> being in <HI>Lithuania,</HI>
one of the principal Lords of the Country said to
him in Conversation: <HI>Whence is it, Sir, that the</HI>
Italians <HI>never forgive an Injury? My Lord,</HI> reply'd
the <HI>Italian, 'tis because they are never easily offended.</HI>
Now this being the great fault of the <HI>Polish</HI> and <HI>Li∣thuanian</HI>
Nobility, the Repartee was very witty, and
as it seem'd to me, the most subtil and ingenious
Censure that a Man could pass on 'em. The <HI>Lithua∣nian</HI>
Nobleman receiv'd the Impression of it so pru∣dently,
that he even affected to expose the fault
of his Country yet farther, in making this return:
<HI>Sir,</HI> (said he) <HI>we should be as easily offended as you
have been made to believe of us in your Country, if
we could be capable of being displeas'd to hear the Truth
told us with so good a Grace.</HI> He afterwards pre∣sented
him with a Horse, and order'd that he
should be conducted at his Charge from his Estate,
which lies within two days Journy of <HI>Grodnaw,</HI>
as far as <HI>Dantzick,</HI> whither this <HI>Italian</HI> had a mind
to go.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="157"/>
And now let any one put in the room of what
he has been reading, such a disposition of Mind as
the greatest part travel with, and he'll easily per∣ceive
what is produc'd by that busy Preference
which determines on the first Prejudices, which
are almost always false, and may easily judg by
this whether it was not necessary to give the Pub∣lick
a method of Travelling. I intend hereafter
to treat of the Politic Genius of all the Courts of
<HI>Europe,</HI> and hope the manner in which I shall dis∣course
of 'em will sute the relish of the World;
because I am to treat of the Facts and Maxims of
common Use and Conversation, without which 'tis
impossible to penetrate into the true Spirit of
those Courts: And I shall begin with the Port, or
Ottoman Court.</P>
