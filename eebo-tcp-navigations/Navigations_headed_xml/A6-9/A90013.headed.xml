<HEAD>The Propositions of Prince <HI>Charles</HI> to the Earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI> their Ingagement at Sea, and a dangerous Fight thereupon.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VPon the neer approach of our Fleet to the revol∣ted ships, the Princes Mariners began to mutiny; <HI>His Highness caused a Councell to be called, &amp; advised with his Officers of a speedy &amp; facile way to unite the said ships; and it was agreed, that every chief Officer in the ships should declare, that His Highnesse had procured</HI> 6000. li. <HI>in Gold, which they should have amongst them, with many other promises and perswasions, that the treaty would end all differences, both by Sea and Land, and then they should come off with more honour, then accepting of an Act of Indempnity now; and finding that the Saylers were somwhat pacified for the present, the Prince sent a Message to the Lord Admirall, declaring his great dislike that his Lordship should endeavour any way to draw His servants from Him, requiring him to desist for the future to do the like, and come and joyn with Him; which doing, He would procure a pardon for him from the King His Royall Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The L. Admirall answered, that he takes it in dishonor that either in himself, or any others, there should be the least thought of his breaking the trust reposed in him; ac∣quainting his Highnesse, that if he were exposed to the greatest extremity that is incident to man, he would ne∣ever dissert the</HI> Parliaments <HI>service; and being in a good
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> condition at Sea, his advice to the Prince was, to come &amp; joyn with the</HI> Parl. <HI>but its thought nothing will be effected till its known how the treaty goes, and we hear that Sir</HI> T. Lunsford <HI>hath bin lately dispatcht privately from the</HI> Brill <HI>for the Isle of</HI> VVight <HI>upon some Message to the King, or for some instructions or advice from those that attend his Mai. this treaty.</HI></P>
<P>By other intelligence we likewise hear, that M. <HI>Mur∣rey</HI> is gone for <HI>England,</HI> but upon what Design as yet. we cannot hear.</P>
<P>Some of our ships ride within two leagues of the revolted ships, with whom we would fain ingage, but as yet cannot; for the <HI>Hollander</HI> instead of securing those revolted ships of the parl. of <HI>England</HI> (a service which in some measure might well be expected at their hands) by holding a neutrality, say they will pre∣vent acts of hostility neer unto their parts, though it were never so many for promoting the affaires of the Parliament. Some assistance of Volunteers is said to be expected from Denmarke which hath beene long spoken of and is still likely, to be as slowly performed for we hear of none that come to the revolted ships, but some few which fled out of England, who are like to have as good a match by comming over to join with them, that are like to mutiny among themselves as the Hollanders had by coveting and engrossing the new Gold that of late they got out of England, or as those which adventured 7000 li. Armes to recrute Duke Hambletons forces, which were taken the last week going for Scotland. Some action hath happened between the two Fleets, upon the Princes indeavour to sayl from <HI>Gory,</HI> and two of his ships in danger of sin∣king.</P>

<P>Letters from the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> say, that the King hath lately received a message from <HI>France,</HI> which re∣present things there in a very sad condition, as to him∣self and friends, and that the Queen cannot b ing about her Design for <HI>England,</HI> the English quarrel beginning to be <HI>a la mode de France.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty is possest with the sad condition of the Scots, yet saith, that their Conquerors in the North are worthy of unparallel'd honour, whose further transactions and Declaration therein, he much expects and accordingly will make his Concessions in the main, which is not to be looked for till the 40 dayes are almost expired.</P>
<P>It is said that his Maj. hath given his positive answer to the second Bill, and hath also given his royall word to passe the same; and that He is very well satisfied in judgment, with the Aswer from the Divines, to his pa∣per for Episcopacy, which was</P>
