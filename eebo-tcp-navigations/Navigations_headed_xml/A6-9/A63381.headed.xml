<HEAD>A True and Faithful ACCOUNT Of an Intire and Absolute VICTORY OVER The French FLEET IN THE WEST-INDIES, BY <HI>Two East-India Ships,</HI> And other VESSELS, at BARBADOES, Made into MEN of WAR. WITH The Number of those Taken and Sunk in the Engagement, together with the Taking, Sack∣ing, and Burning several of the <HI>French</HI> Plan∣tations in those parts.</HEAD>
<P>YEsterdays Post gives Advice from <HI>Bristol,</HI> that two days before there was arrived a small Vessel which came directly from the Island of <HI>Nevis</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> leaving the same the beginning of the last Month, and Informs, That about 12 or 14 Sail of <HI>French</HI> Vessels, form'd into Men of War, had, besides the taking of <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> Infested the Coast greatly, obstructing the Traffick and Commerce of the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, Alarming all the Islands with making a Descent, whereby they were forced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o stand continually upon their Guards, and in several places beat them off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon their Attempts.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>'Twas greatly feared that they would have performed some considerabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Detriment upon <HI>Nevis,</HI> and several other lesser Islands, before Assistanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could come to them from <HI>England:</HI> But it so Fortunately hapned that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company's Ships, <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the <HI>London,</HI> Vessels o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considerable Burthen, being at <HI>Sancta Hellena,</HI> in their Return to <HI>England</HI> from <HI>India,</HI> and there hearing of the War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and therefore considering how dangerous it might be to make a safe passage t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>London,</HI> since they also understood that the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by which they usually Sailed, was in possession of the <HI>French,</HI> they took a Resolution to make to the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where they were joyfully received, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hopes to find a Convoy there, or stay till some of His Majesties Ships arri∣ved to accompany them to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Interim,</HI> the Noise of the <HI>French</HI> continuing on the Coast, the As∣sembly of the Island met, and Representing to Captain <HI>Andrews,</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other Commander of the <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, how serviceable it would be both to King and Countrey, to unlade their Effects, converting their Ships into Men of War, and stand after the <HI>French,</HI> promising at the same time, that they would afford all possible Assistance of Men, and other Shipping; That they would make it their utmost Endeavour so to represent the Matter t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King, and Company, that they doubted not but that they should applau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and confirm the Undertaking.</P>
<P>Accordingly the two Captains were prevailed upon to Unfreight their Ships, and become Men of War; and being joined by Seven other smalle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vessels, Equipped out by the Plantations, they put to Sea with 2300 Land men on Board, went in search after the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, whom they found nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> and Attacked them, being about the like Number, and in less than two hours time Boarded, and took their Admiral, a Ship of 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Guns, and another of 30, sinking two others of the Fleet: And had un¦doubtedly destroyed the whole, had they not run under the Cannon of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fort.</P>
<P>After which, our Fleet made a Descent upon <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>French</HI> lately took from the <HI>English,</HI> drove all the People to the Woods, kil¦ling those that made Resistance, sacked and destroyed the greatest pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thereof, and after three days returned to their Ships, laden with great Plun∣der and Riches.</P>
<P>The same Account adds, That this Victorious Fleet of <HI>Barbadians,</HI> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great Honour and Reputation of the Island, being flushed with Success was resolved to make Efforts on other the <HI>French</HI> Plantations, the like o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they did to <HI>Martinico, Guadalupa,</HI> &amp;c. And 'tis said they have acqui∣red near 100000 l. of Merchandizes, and Things of Value from their En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my, returning to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> laden with Victory and Spoil, to the great En¦couragement and Preservation of all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, and Terro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Afrightment to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
