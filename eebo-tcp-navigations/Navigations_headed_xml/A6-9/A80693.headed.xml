<HEAD>A RELATION Of the Court of ROME.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Sacred Colledge of the Cardinals.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He High Bishop hath for his Collateralls Seventy Cardi∣nalls, that is, Six Bishop-Car∣dinals, Fifty Priest-Cardinals, and Fourteene Deacon-Cardinals: This number being determined by a Bull of Pope <HI>Sixtus Quintus,</HI> are all of them toge∣the called the Sacred Colledge of Cardi∣nalls; And amongst these Cardinals there is alwaies one, who is Chamberlaine of the Sacred Colledge; an Office distinct from his Holiness Chamberlaine of whom in its
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> place shall be spoken: That being granted for life, and this of the Sacred Colledge but for one yeare. The Cardinals which are resident in the Court, succeeding unto it by order of seniority, have during the said yeare the charge of the revenues of the sacred Colledge; and at the end of his Office he gives to every Cardinall his por∣tion, which they that are absent doe not enjoy longer then six moneths after they are parted from <HI>Rome.</HI> Their eminent Lord∣ships make a Secretary of the Colledge, a Nationall Clerk, and a caster up of ac∣compts. The Secretary is alwaies an <HI>Ita∣lian.</HI> The Clerke exercises his Office one yeare onely, and so long, and no more, do every one of the following Nations hold it in their turn, namely the <HI>Germans, French, Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>English;</HI> but the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> doe not enjoy it at this day. All these have good and honorable Entertainement from the Palace, and each of them hath of the heires of every Cardinall that dies five and twenty duckets of the Chamber a peece, and as much of every new Cardinal.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>Of the Secretary of the Sacred Colledge.</HEAD>
<P>THe Office of the Secretary is to enter into the Conclave, and write the let∣ters in the name of the Sacred Colledge, which are subscribed by three Cardinals, Heads of the Orders, that is, the first Bi∣shop-Cardinall, the first Priest-Cardinal; and the first Deacon-Cardinal; which let∣ters are sealed with their three seales. Hee is present and assists in the generall con∣gregations which are made every morning at that time; and in the Congregations of the Heads of the Orders, setting downe all the Orders and Decrees which are made in those Congregations. He keepes a Register also of all the resolutions, which are taken in the secret Consistories, given unto him by the Cardinall Chamberlaine of the sacred Colledge, in which consistory he officiates in a long red habit downe to the ground, and with an hood of the same colour on his shoulders, but at the <HI>extra omnes,</HI> he also goes out of the consistory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>Of the Nationall Clerk of the Sacred Colledge.</HEAD>
<P>THe Nationall Clerk is simply the Se∣cretaries substitute, in whose absence he is to supply his roome, who also stands in the Consistory with the same habit as the Secretary doth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the caster up of the accompts of the Sacred Colledge.</HEAD>
<P>THe Caster up of the accompts, is to keepe good reckoning of the reve∣newes and incomes of the Sacred Col∣ledge, and render an accompt thereof to the Cardinall Chamberlaine abovesaid.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Popes Masters of the Ceremonies.</HEAD>
<P>THe Pope hath foure Masters of the Ceremonies, whereof two are called participants. These have good entertain∣ment from the Apostolicall Palace, and the heyrs of every Cardinall that dyes payes them fifty duckets of the Chambers, and they have likewise an hundred and
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> twelve Duckets of every Cardinal that is newly created, so that their Office yields them seven hundred Duckets yearely a piece: The others are called supernume∣rary, unto each of whom is given by every new Cardinall twelve duckets of the Chamber; and of them the most ancient onely hath intertainement from the Apo∣stolicall Palace: neverthelesse they are all foure Masters of the Ceremonies to the Pope, and the Sacred Colledge, and have equall authority in ordayning the Pontifi∣call functions, advising the Lords Cardi∣nals what they are to doe, and command∣ing every person. They all of them like∣wise are present in the Congregations of Rites, and one alone in the Ceremoniall Congregation, entring all of them into the Conclave. When the Pope sends any Gar∣dinall <HI>Legate de Latere,</HI> he putteth unto him one of those Masters, who are conti∣nually attired in Purple, after the manner of the secret Groomes of the Chamber to his Holiness, amongst whom they are num∣bred, but whilst they are in their habit, they do not give place unto any other, but to the Master of the Chamber, and the Popes Cup-bearer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>Of the Master of the Sacred Palace.</HEAD>
<P>THe Master of the Sacred Palace inha∣bits continually in the Palace of the <HI>Vatican,</HI> with two followers. An Office that alwaies belongs to the Fathers of the Re∣ligion of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> whose charge it is to oversee all the works that are to be prin∣ted in Rome; of which after he hath ap∣proved of them, he keepes a copy; and when they are subscribed by the Lord U cegerent, his Reverend Paternitie setts his hand also unto them, or one of his fel∣lowes, who are Masters, and Fathers of quality, of the same Order. The said Master is present also in the Congregation of the Iudge, &amp; hath place in his Holiness Chap∣pell under the Lord <HI>Deacon,</HI> or the most ancient Auditor present, <HI>della</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ruota is the Ex∣checquer house in</HI> Rome.</NOTE> <HI>Ruota.</HI> There is given him daily from his Holiness intertainment of his owne person, the Fa∣thers his fellowes, and divers servants, to∣gether with a Coach, and other commo∣dities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>Of the Popes Lord Vestry-keeper.</HEAD>
<P>THere lives also in the said Palace the Lord Vestry-keeper, the which charge alwaies belongs to the Fathers of the Order of the <HI>Augustines,</HI> who have the care of the Popes Vestry, wherein is stuffe of great value. He alwaies serves his Holi∣nesse at Masse whensoever hee celebrates, either pontifically or privately; and it ap∣pertaines unto him to provide the Wine, the Water, and the Host, that are to bee consecrated. When he is a titular Bishop, he hath place in the Chappell amongst the Bishops assistants and if he be not a Bishop, he goes notwithstanding in the habit of a regular Prelate. He sits in the Chappell a∣bove the Dean, and Auditor <HI>della Ruota,</HI> waiting upon the Popes Myter, who gives to him daily great intertainment, in the very same manner, as he doth to the most reverend Master of the sacred Palace.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Popes Secretary and under Secretaries.</HEAD>
<P>THe Pope Keeps a noble and numerous Court, divided into divers Classes;
<PB N="8" REF="9"/> The sirst is the Secretary, which is alway's the Cardinall Nephew, or Nephewes, who hath many Secretaries under him; and this Cardinall writes, and subscribes the letters made by his Holiness Order to all Princes, Nuncio's, and others. He signes also the Pattents of many Governors, Po∣destates, provosts Marshalls: &amp; other officers of the State-Ecclesiastical: But the pro∣visions of the Goverments of Cities, and great Territories, Presidentships, Vicele∣gations, &amp; Legations of Provinces, &amp; al dis∣patched by <HI>Brieve sub annulo Piscatoris:</HI> And all those on whom these charges are con∣ferred doe take their oath before the Lord Cardinall Chamberlaine, in the presence of a Notary of the Chamber, &amp; sweare on the <HI>Brieve</HI> it selfe; they that are absent doe it by their Proctor. All the Ambassadors of Princes, at their deparure from negotia∣ting w<SUP>th</SUP> the Pope, give an account of their negotiation to the said Cardinall Nephew, and the like doe all the Ministers of <HI>Rome.</HI> The said Nephew uses to have the Title of Superintendent Generall of the State Ecclesiasticall, which his Holiness gives to him by <HI>Brieve,</HI> and by <HI>Prieve</HI> also he gives him the Title of Secretary.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>Of the Master of the Popes House, and others of the same Court.</HEAD>
<P>THere is moreover the Master of the House, who is alwaies a Praelate; (for you must know, that the Pope never gives the title of <HI>Majordomo</HI> to any) as also the Master of the Chamber; the Cup∣bearer, the Sewer; the chiefe Harbinger, the Carver; the under-master of the Chamber; the under cupbearer; the un∣der-Sewer; &amp; the under-Master of the House; together with secret Chamber∣laines, of whom the Pope declares seven or eight participant-chamberlaines, as seem∣eth good to his Holinesse. And one of these secret Chamberlaines is alwaies se∣cret Treasurer, who bestowes his Holiness Donations and Almes. There is besides an other secret Chamberlaine, that is Wardrobe-keeper, who hath an under-Wardrobe-keeper, and goes in purple. There are other Adjutants likewise. Now it is to be noted, that the said Wardrobe∣keeper hath not in his charge, either hang∣ings, beds, or other such like stuffe, but on∣ly Iewels, Reliques, Gold, Silver, and other things of great value. They doe also di∣stribute
<PB N="10" REF="10"/> daily the blest <HI>Agnus Dei's,</HI> which are made in the said Wardrobe. The Popes were wont to make the <HI>Agnus Dei's</HI> every seven yeares, but Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eighth in the yeare 1600. made them many times, as also great store of Shrines, which hee caused to be distributed freely.</P>
<P>The entertainement of a secret Cham∣berlaine amounts to a thousand crownes a yeare, and he that is a participant-cham∣berlaine hath eight or nine hundred crownes more then those that are not par∣ticipants, because they participate of the rewards and donatives, which are given to the Popes Chamber, and of some pro∣fits of the Apostolicall Chancerie.</P>
<P>The same entertainement, or little less then these Chamberlaines, have the secret-Chamberlaines, who helpe the Pope to officiate and serve him at Masse, when he sayes it private∣ly: One of them carries the Cross be∣fore his Holiness; and when he goes on foot, another bears up the traine of the gowne. Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eighth alwaies kept sixe secret chaplaines, amongst whom was a German, a Spaniard, a Frenchman, a Polander, and a Iapponese, who was at∣tyred after the manner of his country, but
<PB N="11" REF="10"/> in purple colour, all of them nobly borne. His Holinesse hath for the Master of his Chamber the Lord <HI>Silvio Antoniani Romano,</HI> who exercises also the charge of Secretary of the secret <HI>Brieves</HI> much to his commen∣dation, who for the goodnesse of his life, and eminency of learning was created a Cardinall. Moreover his Holiness keepeth a secret Clerk of the private Chappell who hath a good entertainement, &amp; some perquisites; and when the Pope goes to the Chappell pontifically, it belongs to the said Chaplaines to carry the triple Crowne and the pretious Miters, going before the Crosse in the same red habit, which the se∣cret Chamberlaines weare.</P>
<P>There are also the Chaplaines of the Guards and Palfreymen, to the end they may hear Masse every morning, who are called common Chaplaines.</P>
<P>There are secret Adjutants of the Cham∣ber, who have halfe the entertainement of the Chamberlaines aforesaid; and they also doe participate of some fees and per∣quisites, which doe not appertaine to the secret Chamberlaines.</P>
<P>There are besides them Chamberlaines of honour, all persons of quality, and illu∣strious both for birth, and learning. Then
<PB N="12" REF="11"/> are there the Chamberlaines <HI>della Bussola;</HI> the chamberlaines <HI>extra muros;</HI> and the chamberlaines <HI>Scudiere;</HI> every one of the which keepes the watch, and hath his of∣fice distinct, saving the chamberlaines of honour, who doe not appeare in the Pa∣lace, but when they will; and by them the Popes use to send the Hatts to the new Cardinalls.</P>
<P>There is a Sewer, and a Carver of the Sacred Colledge, who hath both of them good entertainment and provision.</P>
<P>There is also a Sewer and Carver of strangers, and a Sewer for the poore, who waits every morning on those poore, which eate in the Palace at his Holinesse charge; an institution introduced by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eight, who ordained, that the Father Rector of the Penitentiaries of St. <HI>Peter</HI> of the Societie of <HI>Jesus</HI> should take care to bring in every morning twelve Pilgrims to eate in the Palace, as is before∣said. All the above mentioned Officers have good entertainement, and provision, and are attyred in purple, according to their quality, in a long habit downe to the ground. Likewise there are two Physiti∣ans for the Family, with good entertaine∣ment, and a purple habit, besides the se∣cret
<PB N="13" REF="11"/> Chamberlain's Physitian.</P>
<P>His Holinesse keepes a Gentleman of quality with the title of Master of the Sta∣ble, (for the Popes do not use to give the title of Master of the Horse) who hath good entertainment, provision, &amp; enjoyes many perquisites. This same alone, besides the Chamberlaines of honor of the Popes Court, goes with a cloak and sword, and hath under him many persons with ho∣nest provisions, whom he may place and displace at his pleasure; and in the stable he hath two hundred Horses, with many Mules for Litters, and carriages. <HI>Clement</HI> the eight introduced the conferring of the title of secret Chamberlain on Cavaliers of the Cloak and Sword; and those same held that title onely for honors sake, with∣out imploying themselves in any thing of service. Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the eleventh also gave this title of Master of the Horse to Signior <HI>Pompeo Frangipani,</HI> a principall Roman Ca∣valier, and a souldier of great merit.</P>
<P>There are other under-Officers, which have the custody of the Popes furniture, &amp; Houshold-stuffe; and these are to take care to see the rooms accommodated, when there is a Consistorie, a Signature of Grace, and a Congregation.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<P>Then there are secret and publique sweepers, who are apparelled in Purple, with an under-coat to the calf of the legg, and were formerly the Popes Coachmen, when he was a Cardinal; as also Palfrey∣men, which are alwaies above forty; for you must know, that every new Pope u∣seth to take for his Palfrey men, all the Deans of the Cardinals, and Ambassadors Palfreymen, that are in <HI>Rome</HI> at the time of his Assumption: which custome is invi∣olably observed, and they are attired in red, or white cloth, as they will them∣themselves, but at the Popes charge, with a purple cloake, and guilt sword. There are likewise twelve Macebearers, and twelve Vergers, both of them vendible Offices, and each one is worth six hundred crownes, or thereabouts, yielding them fifty crowns a year a piece.</P>
<P>There are moreover a great number of lower Offices, which shall be noted in the end of the present Relation.</P>
<P>You are to understand, that the Gate of the Palace stands alwaies but half open, and through it in that manner doth every Cardinal, Ambassador, and other person passe, that go to negotiate with his Holi∣nesse; but both the leaves of the Gate are
<PB N="15" REF="12"/> opened when the Pope himselfe passeth thorough it, or any of the Brothers, or Nephewes of his Holinesse who are then living.</P>

<P>BUT the highest Officers are the Secre∣taries of State, who have great enter∣tainment from the Pope, and are attired in purple, and doe altogether dependon the Cardinal-Nephew aforesaid; and all∣though they negotiate with the Pope, yet they take their directions from the said Cardinal, and to his Eminencie they send their letters to be subscribed. These Se∣cretaries have distributed amongst them the Nuntiatures Provinces, and one of them is a Secretary of the cyphers, which hath but halfe the entertaintment of the o∣ther Secretaries, who do all live in the Popes Palace, and each of their enter∣tainments is fifteene hundred crowns a year, besides the emoluments of their Se∣cretaries place.</P>
<P>Then are there Secretaries of secret <HI>Brieves,</HI> and of <HI>Brieves</HI> that go under tax∣ation, as shall be spoken of in his proper

E∣very one of these hath, besides emolu∣ments, great entertainment from the Pope; and every one of his Holinesses Officers are apparelled in purple, but distinctly according to the place he holds; howbeit the secret Chamberlaines, and those of honor use to wear an under, and upper Garment, the former of Tarzanello in the winter, and of taffeta-sarcenet in the summer, and the other of serge, or say; both of them in every season of purple colour. The Secretaries also are apparelled either with the purple habit of a Prelate, or conformably to the secret Chamberlaines, as aforesaid; the rest are ordinarily clothed with woollen, light or heavy, according to the season. Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eight, in the holy year 1600 caused all his Family to be apparelled in cloth, and this order was ob∣served untill his death: &amp; all the said year his Holines kept no furniture in the rooms where he usually abode; no more did the Cardinal Nephewes, nor the other Car∣dinals

<P>THE Secretaries of the <HI>Brieves,</HI> that go under Taxation, are four and twenty, and every Secretaries place is worth a thousand crowns, yielding be∣tween seven or eight hundred crowns a a year; His Holinesse declares one of these four and twenty superior to the rest, who goes in the habit of a Referendarie, or Do∣mestique Prelate, is lodged in the Palace as an Officer thereof, and hath great enter∣tainment. All the <HI>Brieves</HI> dispatched by this Secretary do pay, except the Indul∣gences, <HI>ad tempus;</HI> and all the said <HI>Brieves</HI> are taxed by one of the four &amp; twenty Se∣cretaries, it belonging to every one of them in his turn to be over the Taxation, and the Originalls of these <HI>Brieves</HI> are review∣ed by the Cardinal Prefect of the <HI>Brieves,</HI> of which Office shall be spoken in its place: Then are the <HI>Brieves</HI> sealed with

<HEAD>Of the Generall of the holy Church.</HEAD>
<P>THE Generall of the holy Church is likewise made by his Holinesse <HI>Brieve,</HI> and his staffe, and an Oath is given him pri∣vately in the Chamber: In time of peace his pay is a thousand crowns a month, and in the time of War three thousand. His authority, and jurisdictions are very great, for five hundred Officers hold their places of him by Patent; which are the Master of the Camp of the Provinces, the Sergeant Majors thereof, the Collaterall Generall, the Paymaster, the Captains of horse, the the Captaines of the Militia, the Colonels of <HI>Ancona,</HI> of <HI>Spoleto,</HI> and of the Mount <HI>San Giovanni;</HI> the Colonel of the little Re∣giment of <HI>Corsi,</HI> the Captains of the <HI>Corsi,</HI> the Collateral, and paymaster of the same; the Collaterall, and Paymaster of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> with the Captains of the horse; the Cap∣tain of the Halberdiers, the Captain of <HI>Ber∣gantino,</HI> and all the other Captaines of the souldierie of that Garrison, and State; as also the Captain of the horse of <HI>Bologna;</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="15"/> the Collaterall, and Paymaster of <HI>Avig∣nion,</HI> and the Captaines of the horse and foot which are in that Regiment; many Captaines of Forts, and all the Captaines of the sconces, and strong holds, which are on the Sea side, and upon the consines: There are likewise two Generalls of the horse, who hold of him by Patent. Hee hath authority to command over the Ge∣nerall of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and over the Generall of <HI>Avignion;</HI> both which Generalls have each of them two hundred crowns a month a∣piece, besides the entertainment of some demy-launces.</P>
<P>He hath also under him a Lieutenant-Generall, with three thousand crownes a years entertainment; and a Sergeant Major Generall, with five hundred crowns a years entertainment; but these four last places are granted by his Holinesse <HI>Brieve;</HI> who likewise makes the Generall of the Artillerie, with an hundred crownes a months entertainment. No souldier can be imprisoned without a License under the Generalls hand, who hath supreme autho∣rity over them. The Souldiers of the Bands or Battagliaes, (whether you will, which are inrolled throughout the whole state of the holy Church) are fourscore
<PB N="22" REF="16"/> thousand foot, and three thousand and five hundred horse: And none of these souldiers have any pay, but onely enjoy divers exemptions, and priviledges, of wearing armes, and others: so that his Ho∣linesse in time of need, may serve himselfe of them without giving impediment to the husbandman in manuring the ground for the mantenance of the City with pro∣vision of victuall: And all these stand rea∣dy armed upon any suddain warning, as in the time of War, being continually dis∣ciplined by their Officers, whereby they become very good Souldiers.</P>
<P>The before-named Generalls of the horse, have each of them an hundred crowns a month entertainment; the Com∣missaries of the horse, which are two, have fifty crowns a month apiece; the seven Marshalls of the Camp of the Provinces, fifty crowns a month apiece; the seven Sergeants Maiors of the Provinces have each of them five and twenty crowns a month; the Collaterall General seventy crowns a month; the Captains of the bands, 20 crownes a month apiece, with their howsrent defrayed, and other perquisites; the Colonells beforenamed thirty crowns a month apiece. The Colonell of the <HI>Corsi,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="16"/> with the Collaterall, Paymaster, Cap∣tains, Officers, and souldiers thereof, are paid after the manner of War: And these are thoroughout all the holy Church im∣ployed againgst the <HI>Banditi,</HI> and sometimes in the Popes Gallies.</P>
<P>It is also necessary to know, that Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eight by the means of Signior <HI>Mario Farnese,</HI> at that time Generall of the Forces of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> made in that fortresse an Armory, replenished with all kind of armes, for the arming of five and twenty thousand foot; and another Armory in <HI>Bo∣logna,</HI> for the arming of ten thousand: And in the Papacie of <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth, the same <HI>Don Mario</HI> introduced into <HI>Tivoli,</HI> a City distant sixteen miles from <HI>Rome,</HI> excellent workmen for the making of all sorts of armes of War; and of those armes framed in <HI>Tivoli,</HI> he made an Armory in Castle St. <HI>Angelo</HI> for the arming of twelve thousand foot; and another Armory for the arming of five thousand; and in the Vatican Pa∣lace two like Armories; as also one in <HI>An∣cona,</HI> and one in <HI>Ravenna.</HI> He likewise cau∣sed fourscore pieces of great Ordnance to be cast. By this it may be seen how great the forces of the Pope are, who hath armes to arm an hundred thousand men, and all
<PB N="24" REF="17"/> his Vassalls are apt for the Warrs, being naturally addicted thereunto. The state of the Holy Church abounds with Captains, and men of command; and in the Castle Saint <HI>Angelo</HI> are millions of ready coine in Gold, besides a million and an halfe in Jewells.</P>

<HEAD>Of the chief Penitentiarie</HEAD>
<P>IN the time of Saint <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and of <HI>Corne∣lius</HI> the Pope, two hundred yeares after <HI>Christ</HI> our Lord, many Christians having sacrificed to Idolls, there was great con∣tending, wehther the relapsers should be admitted to reconciliation, whereupon sprung the schism made by <HI>Novatianus;</HI> fi∣nally the Major part prevailed, that they should be accepted: But because some had sinned lesse, then others, there were Priests deputed, which <HI>pro modo culpae ad∣missam
<PB N="29" REF="19"/> poenitentiam indulgent:</HI> From whence grew the use of Penitentiaries, and all that intervenes in those cases: Whereupon it was constituted, that in each of the Pa∣triarchall Churches of <HI>Rome,</HI> there should be two Priests, who should have the care of imposing pennance according to the penitentiall Canons, which are most an∣tient, as the Bibliothecarie makes mention; and this is all that is found written of it. Now it is likely, that those Priests consti∣tuted in the said Churches, had a head, with whom they were to confer, which upon occasion communicated important cases to the Pope; and this was the Peni∣tentiary, who in truth ought to be very antient: but the most antient mention that <HI>P. Panvino</HI> hath of it, is in that of <HI>Gregory</HI> the tenth in <HI>capit. ubi periculum.</HI></P>
<P>The charge of the chiefe Penitentiarie is exercised at this day by a most eminent Cardinal, conferred on him by his Holi∣nesse, and yields him about eight thou∣sand crowns a year. He hath under him a Prelate with the title of the Regent of the Penitentiaria; whose jurisdiction is over the cases referred to his Holinesse, granting absolutions <HI>gratis ubique,</HI> directed to ap∣proved confessors in Parliament, sealed

<HEAD>Of the Vicechancellor.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chancellors wrote all that which antiently occurred to the Pope to write, both when he gave answer to doubts of faith, which were demanded of him by the Provinces, and Bishops; as all∣so
<PB N="31" REF="20"/> concerning any other thing: And the chiefest person of the Popes spirituall Do∣minion had that authority, which at this day the Secretaries of the <HI>Brieves,</HI> and the Secretaries <HI>ab intimis</HI> have; and moreover the same, which in the Kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> and in many other States, the Chancellor hath <HI>Lucas de Penna,</HI> reciting a certain Epistle of Saint <HI>Isidores,</HI> sets downe what the authority of this Office is. Hee had under him twelve, which were called <HI>Schrinerari,</HI> and one <HI>Protoschrinerario;</HI> all which assisted him in sustaining the weight of his charge, according as he di∣rected them.</P>
<P>The most antient mention, which is found of this Office is in Saint <HI>Jerome,</HI> in an Epistle of Monarchy <HI>ad Gerontiam,</HI> who was Chancellor.</P>
<P>This Office untill <HI>Gregory</HI> the eight was alwaies given to Bishops, or Cardinalls; and about the year 1100. the Bishop-Car∣dinal of Saint <HI>Rufina</HI> was ever Chancellor, for so had <HI>Benedict</HI> the eight granted it by dispensation. It fell from that custome in the year 1071. under <HI>Alexander</HI> the se∣cond, after whose time it was alwaies in the hands of Priests, or Deacon-Cardinals. <HI>Gregory</HI> the eight, who had this Office, be∣ing
<PB N="32" REF="21"/> made Pope, began to give it out of the Colledge of Cardinalls, and conferred it on a <HI>Lateranense</HI> Canon, who, because he was no Cardinal, intitled himself <HI>Can∣cellarij vicem Agens.</HI> The giving that Office out of the sacred Colledge continued an hundred years; and the Ministers <HI>vicem a∣gentes,</HI> were called Vicechancellors, as a more commodious word.</P>
<P>This Office under <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight, re∣turned into the sacred Colledge of Cardi∣nalls, and was given to <HI>Ricardo Pelroni,</HI> a Nobleman of <HI>Siena,</HI> who being made a Cardinal, never remembring the antient institution, continued Vice-chancellor, and so thorough heedlesnesse it came to be the name of the Office.</P>
<P>He that had this Office was called Chancellor or Bibliothecarie, which is as∣much in effect, because he was likewise Praefect of the Library. In the time that the Emperor nominated the Pope, the Master of the Rolls called himself <HI>Archicancellari∣us Imperij pro Italia, &amp; Apostolicae Sedis Bib∣liothecarius, vel Cancellarius, seu Archicancel∣larius,</HI> and they that were in <HI>Rome</HI> said; <HI>Da∣tum Romae per manum N. Diaconi Cardinalis Vicecancell. Archiepiscopi Colonien. Aposto∣licae Sedis Bibliothecarij, seu Cancellarij:</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="21"/> whence it is to be noted, that the date was put downe by the said Chancellor.</P>
<P>Nor was the Office of the Datarie di∣stinct from the Chancellor; which distin∣ction was established at <HI>Avignion,</HI> and therefore it is to be considered, that the Datarie in his date said not, <HI>per manum B.</HI> but <HI>Simpliciter.</HI></P>
<P>An eminent Cardinall exerciseth the charge of Vicechancellor, and it yeelds him between fifteene and sixteene thousand crownes a yeare; whose jurisdiction is o∣ver the dispatches of Apostolicall letters concerning all matters, whereof the sup∣plications are signed, except those which are dispatched by <HI>Brieve sub Annulo Pisca∣toris:</HI> And in his Palace three times a week, that is, Tuesday, Thursday, and Sun∣day, doe the Officers of the Chancery A∣postolicall assemble together; which are the Regent, and the Abbreviators <HI>de Parco magiore,</HI> being twelve Prelats besides the Regent; and who are all attyred in the purple habit of a Prelate, and their Offi∣ces are sold, the Regentship for two and twenty thousand crownes, and every Ab∣breviator for eleven or twelve thousand crownes; their money yeelding them be∣tween eight and ten in the hundred: and
<PB N="34" REF="22"/> six of the Abbreviators Offices, together with that of the Regent are at the dispo∣sing of the Cardinal Vicechancellor. These thirteene Prelates have place in his Holi∣ness Chappell, but the Regent never goes thither in respect of precedencie with o∣ther Prelates. They are also Refendaries, both of the one and the other Signature; and the Regent moreover hath power to commit the causes of Appeales in <HI>Rome,</HI> which he committs to the Auditors of the <HI>Ruota,</HI> and to the Referendaries, distribu∣ting them by order, so that every one may have a part in them.</P>
<P>The Office of the <HI>Abbreviators,</HI> is to make the Originalls of the Bulls upon the sup∣plications already signed by his Holinesse, and to review the Bulls after they are faire written in parchment. The Abbreviators <HI>de Parco minore,</HI> the Clerkes, and other Of∣ficers, which are there, who have bought their places, and whose profit is founded on the emoluments of such dispatches, and annates, assist in the taxing, reviewing, and signing the Bulls; receiving their fee of the summe taxed, which is paid by him that dispatcheth the Bulls. Furthermore, the Cardinall Vicechancellor is he, that in the secret Consistoreis take the collatiōs of
<PB N="35" REF="22"/> the Cardinalls tythes, and the declarations of promotions, and collations of Bishop∣pricks, which the Pope makes <HI>pro tempore,</HI> as also of consistoriall Abbies, giving forth the scedules of such provisions.</P>

<P>THe Head of the Deacons, which had the care of the revenues, was the Arch∣deacon, who was the Cardinall, and his dignity, that was most ample, continued to the yeare 1100. at which time in regard of the too much greatnes thereof, (for ma∣ny of them bearded the Popes, and with the power that they had, made their way to the Papacie) that dignitie was taken a∣way, and in stead thereof another institu∣ted, called Chamberlaine, which was con∣ferred on a Cardinall, to whom Coadju∣tors were given, which were stiled Clerks of the Chamber Apostolicall, whose Of∣fice from the institution thereof is that of the Chamberlaine: Now there was added unto it the Treasurer, for a difference which the Popes would have betweene it and the Chamberlaine; and afterwards for the same respect the President was al∣so added.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
<P>The Cardinall Chamberlaines place yeelds him, one yeare with another, be∣tween twelve and fourteene thousand crownes, and his jurisdiction is to take Cognisance of all the causes, which apper∣taine to the Chamber Apostolicall, and the Clerkes thereof, of whom I will speake in its place joyntly, and of some of them likewise severally. Hee sits in the Chamber, when he is not kept from thence by the Consistories, and the most part of the dispatches there passe under his name, although they be discussed, and subscribed by the Clerke. Now you must know, that in the Chamber Apostolicall the Cardinal Chamberlaine, and all the other Prelates, sit with their purple Pontificall Coape Rochett; and the other Officers, which assist also in the said Chamber, with other habits different from the ordinary.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Datarie.</HEAD>
<P>THen there is the Datarie, which though it be a moveable office, yet is it the most esteemed of all others, being usually given by the Pope to Prelates of worth, and oftentimes for many years past to Cardinals, through whose hands, the vacancy of all Benefices, which are not expressed to be above the valew of foure and twenty duckets a yeare, do passe; and he doth cause supplications to be signed, even without the participation of the Pope; and for other benefices of greater valew, dignities, and Canons places, the Datarie may in carrying the supplications to his Holynesse, and ex∣posing the concurrents unto him, favour the merits of one more then another: It stands in his power to pardon that part of of the compositions, wherein certain sorts of graces are taxed; for the which, accor∣ding to the stile of the Datarie, is paid, sometimes a greater, sometimes a lesser summe, as the matters are.</P>
<P>He and his under-Dater, have every day audience of the Pope, carrying the sup∣plications to be signed by his Holynesse,
<PB N="73" REF="42"/> under the which supplications, he puts the date, that is, <HI>Datum Romae apud,</HI> from whence he is called the Datarie: albeit such Cardinalls, as have exercised that place from the time of Cardinall <HI>Arigone,</HI> untill now, have been cased of the labour of dating the supplications, causing them to be dated by others.</P>

<P>HE hath under him the under-Dater, whose office is to consider all the dis∣patches, which passes through the Data∣rie, except the vacancies of the benefices that happen by death, for they go through the hands of the Dater himselfe, or of his substitute expresly deputed by him for that purpose, and it is named the office of <HI>per obitum,</HI> which giveth an account of them to the Dater, for to have them af∣terwards signed, when they are all carryed to the Popes audience. This under-Dater goes apparelled in purple.</P>
<P>He that is Dater hath two thousand crowns a year entertainment from the Pope; the under-Dater a thousand, and
<PB N="74" REF="43"/> so proportionably all the other lower of∣ficers.</P>
<P>He hath also Revisors, which help him to review the supplications after they are signed, whereunto they put such re∣strictions, as to them seem convenient; all the supplications of the Datarie passing through their hands.</P>
<P>He hath moreover an officer, who hath his name of the petty-Dates, through whose hands passe all the supplications, at the foot whereof the petty Date useth to be put, that it may be afterwards ex∣tended, whensoever the suppliant will go on with his supplications; for many times, for want of money to defray the charge, or in regard of some other lawfull cause, he stays many months in making the dis∣patch, before they will cause the said great Date to be extended unto the sup∣plication, after it is signed.</P>
<P>He hath another officer having his ti∣tle from the compositions, unto whom those supplications signed, and reviewed by all the other officers, are sent, which ought to pay compositions; nor do they part from him, untill the summe of mony wherewith the aforesaid supplications are taxed, be satisfied, sending the
<PB N="75" REF="43"/> others which doe not pay composition, to the Register, of whom shall be spoken hereafter.</P>
<P>He hath another officer of the missives, whose care is to send generally the sup∣plications past, as abovesaid, by the Data∣rie to the Registers, that is, to the pub∣lique, and to the secret Registers, with making distinction of those which are to be sent to the publique Registers, and in resignations, and pensions, to set down the day when they are sent to the Regi∣sters; by meanes of which missive the con∣sents have at other times been extended, according to the <HI>Clementina,</HI> which, after <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth, hath been no long∣er in use.</P>
<P>He hath an other officer, called the re∣visor of Matrimoniall dispensations, who hath no other care, but to cause all sup∣plications to be signed, which concern dispensations in the degrees of consan∣guinitie, and affinity, as also excommuni∣cations, <HI>ad Revelationem,</HI> called <HI>Signifi∣cavit.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the aforesaid Officers, which the Dater hath under him, there is not any that buyes his office, but he of the compo∣sitions, all the rest being chosen by the
<PB N="76" REF="44"/> Dater, except the under-Dater, who is wont to be chosen by the Pope.</P>
<P>There are twenty Officers, who are cal∣led Registers of Supplications, which Of∣fices are sold; and it appertaines unto them to Register all the Supplications, <HI>de verbo ad verbum,</HI> that are signed by the Pope, or others his Officers deputed for the same: and after they are registred, they are sent to the Chancery, to cause the dis∣patch of the Bulls, according to the tenor of the said Supplications.</P>
<P>There are also foure Officers, which are called Masters of the Register, unto whom it belongs to heare the Supplications, re∣gistred by the Registers, read, to see if the Register agrees with the originall; &amp; they themselves set on the backside of the Sup∣plications the Registratiō, which is a great <HI>R.</HI> within the which are their names writ∣ten.

<P>There is the Office of the Leade where∣unto goe all the Bulls for the affixing of the Lead to them, which universally are seene by all the Popes <HI>pro tempore.</HI> This Of∣fice is bought for three thousand crownes, and yeelds about three thousand crownes a yeare.</P>

<P>There is the Register of the Bulles, which are registred in it by Officers deputed thereunto, and are vendible after they are dispatched <HI>ad aeternam Rei memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>In the Register of the Bulles are the Ma∣sters of the Register of the Bulles, which is a venall Office. To them it belongs to con∣ferr the Registers with the Originalls; and having compared them together, they sett on the backside of the Bulles the Registra∣tion, which is a great <HI>R</HI> with their names written within the said letter.</P>
<P>The Bulles and Graces <HI>in forma Dignum,</HI> are those provisions of Benefices, and Dig∣nities, which the Pope committs to the Ordinarie, to be conferred on the suppli∣cant, if he shall be found fit.</P>
<P>The Bulles of Grace are they, wherein the Pope provides, and conferrs liberally of himselfe, without committing the Col∣lation to the Ordinary, or others.</P>
<P>That is said to be an obreptitious suppli∣cation, wherein the suppliant delivers that which is false.</P>
<P>A Surreptitious is that, wherein the truth is concealed, but they are often put for one and the same, and in summe obreptitious∣nesse and surreptitiousnes are committed, when that it is said which is not, or that is concealed which is.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="45"/>
<P>Between the dispatches of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>France</HI> there is no other difference, but that in those of <HI>Spaine,</HI> all the <HI>Bulles</HI> or <HI>Brieves</HI> are dispatched; in those of <HI>France,</HI> there is no dispatch of Bulles at all, such as con∣cessions, and resignations are, wherein the signing of the supplication alone is suffici∣ent, except it be of Monasteries and Ab∣bies, which are taxed <HI>in libris Camerae,</HI> whereof the Bulles are also dispatched, it being established in that manner between <HI>Pope Leo</HI> the tenth, and the said Kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> likewise.</P>
<P>Furthermore the Apostolicall dispensa∣tions, granted to divers French Cardinals, enabling them to conferre Benefices, takes away a great part of the dispatches.</P>
<P>Besides the Office aforesaid, there are the under written venall Offices, that doe not exercise jurisdiction, which are worth the ensuing summes.</P>

<P>THe Participant Subdeacons, are in number five. Their Office is, for one of them to carry the Papall Crosse before the Pope, whensoever he goes forth in publique about Divine, or humane affairs, either on Horse-back or on foot, as the occasion requires. When the Pope re∣paires
<PB N="88" REF="50"/> to the Chamber of Ornaments, to put on his sacred vestures, two of them are there ready, to help the Deacons Car∣dinalls, in attyring him with them, which being done, one of them takes up, and carries the Crosse before him: Between the Crosse and the Pope, none are to go, but only the Cardinalls, and such as do sit on their seat. The Master doore-keep∣ers do alwaies associate the Crosse, the one on the one side, and the other on the other, with their silver verges. When the Pope either after the Sermon, or at the end of Masse, is to give his solemn Bene∣diiction, the Sub-deacon takes up the Crosse, and placeth himselfe just before the Pope, turning the Crucifix towards him; for it is to be noted, that whensoever the Crosse is carried before the Pope, the Sub deacon ever turnes the Crucifix back∣ward upon him, and when he is not pre∣sent, he turnes the Crucifix forward. Of the severall services which the Sub-dea∣cons performe in divers acts unto the Pope, and their administration about the Pall, is sufficiently spoken of in other places; these are all the offices of the Court, that are of most eminency.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Solemne Benediction which the Popes use to give three times in the yeare.</HEAD>
<P>THe Popes by an ancient institution use to blesse the people solemnly thrice a yeare, that is, on Maundy Thurse∣day, Easter day, and Ascension day. Anci∣ently they were wont to fulminate excom∣municants every time before they gave their benediction, but now that is onely done upon Maundy Thursday.

<HEAD>Of the Benediction of the <HI>Golden Rose</HI> by the Pope.</HEAD>
<P>THe Popes are accustomed on the fourth Sunday of Lent, when as <HI>Laeta∣re Hierusalem,</HI> is sung in the Church, to blesse the Golden-Rose, and to give the same to some great Prince, if he be present in the Court: but if there be no Prince in the Court worthy of so great a gift, it is sent abroad to some King or Prince as seemeth best to his Holinesse, with the advice of the sacred Colledge: for the Pope
<PB N="93" REF="52"/> useth either before, or after Masse, to call the Cardinalls into his Chamber, or to some other place according as it pleaseth him; and deliberateth with them, to whom the said Rose shall be given or sent: whereupon there is a little Altar prepared, with two silver Candlesticks on it, to which the Pope repairing, he kneels down before it, and thus prayes. <HI>O Lord God, by whose word and power, all things are made; and by whose providence the whole world is governed, which art the joy and gladnesse of all the faith∣full: we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that thou wilt of thy goodnesse, vouchsafe to blesse and sanctifie this Rose, which at this present, in signe of spirituall joy we hold in our hands: And be∣cause the Church doth this day to the glory of thy name, triumph and rejoyce in this signe, be gra∣tiously pleased to impart unto it perfect gladnesse, so that to all them which with devotion shall re∣ceive it, thou wilt grant remission of sins, increase of faith, thy mercifull protection, and all pros∣perity; for his sake who with the liveth &amp; reigneth in the unity of the Holy spirit, God for ever and ever, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>This prayer ended, the Pope anoynts the Golden Rose with <HI>Balsamum,</HI> puts Musk upon it, sprinkles it with holy-wa∣ter, and perfumes it with incense; all
<PB N="94" REF="53"/> which are ministred unto him, by the Lord keeper of the vestry. After this, the Pope departs away, and carryes the said Rose to his Chamber, where, if he, unto whom he intends to give it, is present, he is called for, and to him, kneeling at his feet, he gives the Rose saying: <HI>Receive from us, who, though most unworthy, do hold the place of God on earth, this Rose, whereby is signified, the joy of both the</HI> Hierusalems: <HI>namely, of the Tri∣umphant and militant Church; receive it, I say, beloved sonne, who according to thy noble ex∣traction art indued with greatnesse, and power, to the end thou mayest be the more enabled with all vertue in Christ our Lord, as the Rose planted on the banks of many waters; which grace vouchsafe he to grant unto thee of his infinite mercy, who is three in one from everlasting to everlasting, in the name of the Father, of the sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.</HI> Then he unto whom the Rose is given, after he hath kissed the Popes foot and hand, departs to his owne home, accompanied with the whole Col∣ledge of Cardinalls, in the midst of two of the ancientest of them, and attended upon by the foot posts of the Roman Court, who use to receive from him, unto whom the Rose is given, great rewards.</P>

<HEAD>Of the manner of the Canonization of a Saint by the Pope.</HEAD>
<P>AFter that the Fame of the excellencie of life, and Holinesse of some cer∣tain person, together with the miracles he hath done, have been spread abroad, and that the Pope hath been made acquainted therewith, by some King, Prince or peo∣ple, which doe pray, that the said person being dead, may be inrolled in the Cata∣logue of Saints, and be declared and ho∣noured for a Saint; his Holinesse doth ad∣vise of the matter with his Brethren, whereupon if he thinks it fit to proceed to inquisition, he requires some Pre∣lates, which are resident in those parts, where the said person lived, and lies bu∣ried, diligently to informe themselves, and carefully to enquire of the fame, opinion and peoples devotion, concerning the said person: which inquisition they are to make without the Legall examination of witnesses; and what they finde, faithfully to report by their Letters unto the Pope, who doth then propound all that hath been related by the said Prelates unto the sacred Colledge, and with them, delibe∣rates
<PB N="96" REF="54"/> whether their relation seem wor∣thy enough of a further enquirie, which if it doe, the same, or other Prelates are re∣quired most diligently to enquire of the matter, to examine witnesses, and throughly to search into all things which may conduce to the finding out of the truth thereof; and articles and interrogato∣ries, are sent under the Apostolicall <HI>Bull</HI> to the said Prelates, wherewith they are to examine witnesses upon oath, concerning the excellencie and sanctimony of life, and purity of Faith of the said person; as also touching the miracles he hath wrought: which being accordingly per∣formed by them, they are to send all that they have done, together with the depo∣sitions of the witnesses, faithfully written in their Letters, sealed with their seales, to the Court; which the Pope having re∣ceived, commits the examination thereof to some Auditors of the sacred Palace, who make processes, to the end they may see whether the inquisition, and probation be legitimate, and sufficiently made: Then if they report that all is as it ought to be, the Pope againe, by the advice of his Brethren, appoints three Cardinalls, diligently to examine the inquisitions,
<PB N="97" REF="54"/> proofes, and depositions of the witnesses, and carefully to consider all things, that are to be considered, especially concern∣ing the said persons excellency of life, and puritie of faith, which if they shall be judged by the Colledge to be well proved, and worthy of sanctification, the Pope with the consent of the Cardinalls, pro∣ceeds to the approbation of the said per∣sons life, and miracles, which have been so sufficiently proved, and decrees the Can∣nonization of him: After this, all the Pre∣lates of the Court, with the Pope and sa∣cred Colledge, assemble together in the secret Consistory; where his Holinesse briefly propounds to what end they are there met, and declares with what dili∣gence and faithfulnesse the inquisition of this matter hath been made, how full and legall the attestation thereof hath been, and with what instance, Princes and peo∣ple have sued unto him about it: where∣fore he requires them, that in discharge of theri consciences, they would each of them in particular deliver their opinion freely and sincerely; and when they have done so, he gives them thanks for their good counsel, exhorting them to pray un∣to God, that he will not suffer them to
<PB N="98" REF="55"/> erre in so weighty a businesse, and so they all goe away. The day of Canonization being determined, there is in the meane time a wooden Scaffold erected in Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church, of that bignesse, as upon it may be fitted a Chappell, with an Altar, a Pontificall Throne, seats for the Cardi∣nalls assisting the Pope, for Ambassadors, for a quire of singing men, and places for all the orders of the Roman Court, like unto the Chappell of the Apostolicall Palace, with Lattice windows, and of that capacitie, and with such manner of seats: there is also a faire paire of Stairs made to ascend unto that Scaffold, which on the outside is strewed all over with herbs and flowers, and on the inside is hung with goodly peeces of Tapestry: the Church too is very richly adorned, and the Armes of the Pope, and of the Church, as also the image of him that is to be Ca∣nonized hanged round about it. The day of Canonization being come, the Pope in all his Pontificalibus, and with his triple Crowne on his head, goes under a Canopy of State, borne over him in Pro∣cession, with all the Cardinalls, Prelats, and Officers, each of them with a new wax light burning in his hand, unto the
<PB N="99" REF="55"/> said Church of Saint <HI>Peter;</HI> where being arrived, his Holiness ascends the said Scaf∣fold, and sitting downe in the throne pre∣pared for him, all the Cardinalls come, and doe him obeisance. After that, he repaires unto the Altar, and places himselfe in a∣nother seate, made ready for him; where he makes a speech, relating summarily, and in generall termes, all that hath beene done in the businesse, as also the life, and miracles of the person aforesaid; exhor∣ting them all, to joyne with him in prayer unto God, that he would not permitt his Church to erre in this affaire. That done, the Proctor of the cause humbly beseech∣eth the Pope, in the name of the Princes, or people, which are suitors to him for it, that he will pronounce and declare <HI>N.</HI> to be a Saint; and that hee will cause him to be inrolled in the catalogue of Saints, and as a Saint to be honored of all faithfull Christians. Whereupon the Pope with a loud voyce saith thus: To the honour of the invisible Trinity, for exaltation of the Catholique faith, and augmentation of the Christian Religion, We by the autho∣rity of the said God Almighty, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, and the blessed Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> doe by the advice
<PB N="100" REF="56"/> of our Brethren Decree and declare <HI>N.</HI> of blessed memory to be a Saint; and to bee inrolled in the Catalogue of Saints: Or∣daining, that his feast shall by the Church Universall be on such a day every yeare devoutly, and solemnly celebrated. And do moreover by the same Authority grant unto all, that, being truly penitent, and confest, shall with devotion visit the shrine of the said Saint <HI>N.</HI> pardon of their sinnes for an hundred and forty dayes. Now some Popes doe grant plenary Indulgence to such visitants, as we reade <HI>Boniface</HI> the ninth did, when he Canonized <HI>Brigid</HI> for a Saint: The Pope having finished in the manner aforesaid, <HI>Te Deum laudamus</HI> is sung by the Gentlemen of the Chappell, at the end whereof the Deacon saith, <HI>Pray for us blessed Saint N.</HI> whereunto the Pope ad∣deth, <HI>He are us, O Lord, for the prayers, and me∣rits sake of holy Saint</HI> N. After this his Ho∣linesse sings the Masse of the day, with the commemoration of the said Saint; and whilst the Creede is sung, three Cardinalls offer unto the said Saint in the Offertory three white waxe lights, three turtle doves also white, and other birds. Masse being done, the Pope departs away, accompani∣ed with the Cardinalls, as he useth to be.</P>

<P>UPon Munday, Thursday, after the solemne Benediction, the Cardinalls accompany his Holinesse, who is carried in his chaire by his Palfreymen, unto the Ducall Hall, where being arrived, he puts off his Papall ornaments, and by the Dea∣con Cardinall assisting him being adorned with a purple stole, a red pluniate and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pluniate is a black long coate.</NOTE> plaine Miter, he sitts downe in the Pontifi∣call seate prepared for him: Then putting incense into the Censer, he blesseth the Deacon Cardinal, who is to reade the Gos∣pel. That done, he kisseth the Text which is held forth unto him by the Apostolicall Subdeacon; and so being Censed by the said Cardinall Deacon, the Anthem of <HI>Mandatum novum,</HI> beginning to be sung by the Singing men, he layes by his pluniate, and an aprone before him, in which habit he washeth the feet of twelve poore men, unto each of whom he causeth to be given by the Treasurer Generall successively cer∣taine Medalls of gold and siluer; and by the Master of the Houshold the Towell, wherewith their feet were wiped. That done the Pope returnes unto his seate, af∣ter
<PB N="102" REF="57"/> he hath put off his aprone, washed and dryed his hands, the bason of water being held unto him by the greatest secular No∣ble man, or Prince there present, and his hands wiped by the chiefe Priest-Cardinal. Then putting his red pluniate on againe, and laying downe his Myter, he sayes the Pater Noster, together with the verses, and prayer them. After this he placeth him∣selfe anew in his seate, puts on his Miter, goes on foot to the Chamber of dressing, and so returnes to his lodging.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Cardinalls, and their Originall.</HEAD>
<P>THis word Cardinall, signifies no other, then <HI>Presbyter principalis; nam altissimae Caeli portae vocantur cardines, ventique inde ve∣nientes appellantur cardinales. In Parochia in qua erant plures Clerici; qui caeteris praeerant in ea parochia, &amp; qui suberat Episcopo, appellaba∣ter Presbyter Cardinalis, &amp; ista convertebantur, habebat curam annimarum, et erat Presbyter Cardinalis.</HI></P>
<P>This word, as it is likely, was found out in the time of Pope <HI>Higinius,</HI> an hundred and fifty yeares after Christ, whereas many Priests were placed in Parishes, and degrees of them setled, whereupon the Office be∣ing
<PB N="103" REF="57"/> found, it was probable the name was then also found.</P>
<P>The first mention of the word Cardinall was in the time of Saint <HI>Silvester,</HI> three hundred yeres after Jesus Christ our Lord appeared by the Synod held in Rome un∣der Saint <HI>Silvester.</HI></P>
<P>This word Cardinal is at this day com∣mon to three degrees; to Priests, Deacons, and Bishops. At the first, as we see before, it was given to Priests only, whose Office it was then in particular, to have a care of the buriall of the Faithfull, whereunto the other Priests were not admitted, as is ex∣tant in <HI>Anastasius</HI> the <HI>Bibliothecarie</HI> in the life of Pope <HI>Marcellus.</HI> As for the rest, the Priests were equall, in preaching, in admi∣nistring the Sacraments (except Bap∣tisme as I have already said) in assisting the Pope, in being imployed as Legates; and this before <HI>Constantine.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Constantine,</HI> the Priest Cardinalls began to have I know not what kind of more prerogative above other Priests that were not Cardinals; so that leaving off that particular care of Baptisme, and Burialls, they onely went forth in Legations, and of them above for the most part was the Pope made, having power over the Priests, and
<PB N="104" REF="58"/> Clerks of their jurisdiction.</P>
<P>This continued sixe hundred yeares, un∣till <HI>Gregory</HI> the seventh; at which time, as∣well by the Emperor, as of the rest of the Clergy, and people from the election, the authority of the Cardinalls increased, for that they were they alone, which made the Pope, and commonly out of their own order. Now that they might maintaine their dignity, the revenew of their Titles not being sufficient for many of them, they began to have <HI>in commenda</HI> simple Benefi∣ces, Canonships, Archpresbyters, and the like.</P>
<P>When a Bishoprick was given to any of these, the dignity of Cardinall was void, as inferior to the other. Afterwards, when they were made Bishops, they demanded that by way of grace they might retaine the nomination only, leaving the title of Priest, calling themselves <HI>Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinales,</HI> without title, but <HI>Cardi∣nales Ecclesiae Dei.</HI> In the time of Pope <HI>Alex∣ander,</HI> the third, after they were made Bi∣shops, perceiving that to bee a Cardinall was a great importance for their attaining to the Papacie, and for their intervening in their election of the Pope, they began to retaine the Title, as to be both Bishop
<PB N="105" REF="58"/> of a place, &amp; a Cardinal of Rome together, howbeit with this advertisement, that no Bishop was made a Cardinall, because it was reputed a descending in degree: but if the Cardinall was made a Bishop, he retai∣ned both the one and the other.</P>
<P>In processe of time, the Bishops begin∣ning to desire to be Cardinalls, sought for meanes to make Cardinalls that were no Priests, but they were not able to doe it untill <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight was Pope, when as the Court went to <HI>Avignion,</HI> where every thing going to confusion, both Bishops, Priests, and Deacons were made Cardi∣nalls; and Cardinals had Bishopricks, and Abbacies more then one, given them <HI>in commenda:</HI> upon this occasion too the Car∣dinalls began to proceed Bishops, that were meere Bishops; and this precedencie began not absolutely, but in <HI>Avignion.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Deacons and Priests Cardinalls.</HEAD>
<P>DEacons Cardinalls were anciently seven, like unto the seven Deacons which were instituted by the Apostles; the chiefe of the Deacons was called Deacon-Cardinall, or Archdeacon,
<PB N="106" REF="59"/> that signified asmuch in imitation of the Priests Cardinalls, who were in title above the other Prelates, as appears in the Synod of Saint <HI>Silvester.</HI></P>
<P>These Deacons had care of the revenues of all the Churches, and the Almes of the faithfull, providing for all the Priests, aswell Priests Cardinalls, as others, and for the Pope also; and this unto the time of <HI>Constantine.</HI> But here is to be noted, that the sub-Deacons had the care of receiving the revenues, and the Deacons of keeping and dispensing them, according as it was ordained.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Constantine,</HI> persecutions ceasing, those seven Deaconships, not sufficing Deacons for the service of every title were appointed in the parishes where there were Priests and Priests-Cardinalls, who had a care of the Popes, that is, the Church of <HI>Romes</HI> revenues; and those were called Deacon Cardinalls, untill the year a thousand, in the time of Pope <HI>Silvester,</HI> or thereabout.</P>
<P>At which time, the Deacons attending no longer on the revenue, whereof there was a new particular Officer constituted, they were left only to the reading of the Gospell before the Pope; in which time,
<PB N="107" REF="59"/> because the number of the seven regiona∣ry Deacons were increased, for <HI>Rome</HI> was then divided into so many Regions, and every one of them had the charge of read∣ing the Gospell in the Church of his Regi∣on, when as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope went to say Masse in either of their said Churches; and they were called Cardinalls of the first, of the second, and of the third Region, accord∣ing as the Region was named, whereof they were intituled Cardinalls.</P>
<P>The other foure Deacons were called Palatine Cardinalls, in the Lateran, <HI>Alta∣ris Ministri,</HI> because they read the Go∣spell before the Pope in Saint <HI>John de La∣teran.</HI></P>
<P>These Deacons had their settled dwel∣ings in <HI>Rome,</HI> neer to certain Churches, or Oratories, without cure of soules; from which Churches leaving the name of Re∣gions, they began to have their denomi∣nations; that is, <HI>Petrus Diaconus, Cardinalis sancti Adriani,</HI> whereas they said before, <HI>Regionis talis,</HI> and this was five hundred yeers agoe, or thereabout, in the time of <HI>Paschall</HI> the second,</P>
<P>The reputation of these grew up to∣gether, with that of the Priests Cardinals, in regard they had all of them the name,
<PB N="108" REF="60"/> and prerogative of a Cardinall, and assist∣ed in the Election of the Pope.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Bishops Cardinalls.</HEAD>
<P>THere are here to be noted three things, the first, in regard the tran∣slation from one Bishoprick to another was anciently held inconvenient, for three hundred yeares space together, namely, to the yeare nine hundred, none that was a Bishop of another place, was ever chosen Pope of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but one still that was either a Priest or a Deacon of the said Roman Church; &amp; the reason thereof it may be was, because the Priests of <HI>Rome</HI> would have none elected but one of their owne number: the first that was otherwise elected was <HI>Formosus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Porto,</HI> in the eight hundred nintie and one: whereupon arose many uproares for transgressing the antient Custome, as may be seen in <HI>Pla∣tina.</HI></P>
<P>The second, that a Citty being once possest by the enemy, the Bishop thereof was admitted into some other Bishoprick that was void, with condition, that upon restitution to his owne Church, he should returne to his flock, and be called the</P>
<PB N="109" REF="60"/>
<P>Priest or Bishop of that place, which had been committed unto him: as if <HI>Fundi</HI> had been taken by the Turks, thus it would be said, <HI>Petrus Episcopus Fundanus et Sacerdos, Cardinalis Ferracinens.</HI> If so be the charge of the Bishoprick of <HI>Ferracina</HI> had been conferred on him, as appears in Saint <HI>Gre∣gory,</HI> where there are foure or five exam∣ples of it.</P>
<P>The third, that in the consecration of the Pope, there were deputed seven Bi∣shops, namely, <HI>Albanus, Ostiensis, Portuen∣sis, Sanctae Rufinae, Tusculanus, Prenestinus, Sabinensis:</HI> And these in the beginning did not intervene in the Election, but only in the consecration.</P>
<P>Foure hundred years after, or there a∣bout, in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> the third, they were admitted to the Election, and then they began to be called Bishops Car∣dinalls, like unto the Priests and Deacons Cardinalls, which intervened in the Ele∣ction of the Pope: but before that, there was never any called Bishop Cardinall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="110" REF="61"/>
<HEAD>Of the Cardinals Titles.</HEAD>
<P>THe Titles of Priests-Cardinalls, were of a determinate number, that is, eight and twenty, as those of the Deacons eighteen, and those of the Bishops seven. Now in Rome there were five Churches built, which were called Patriarchall; that is, Saint <HI>John de Lateran,</HI> representing the Pope: Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> representing the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> that of <HI>Alexandria, Sancta Maria magiore,</HI> that of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> and Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> without the Walls, that of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>To the Ministers of the <HI>Lateran</HI> (for that it was the Cathedrall) were deputed the seven Bishops Cardinalls, to that of the others (because they were of lesse dignity) seven Priests Cardinalls for each of them; and this number was setled for twelve hundred years, untill the time of <HI>Innocent</HI> the second; before whom, Cardinalls were not made many together, but one by one as they came to be void.</P>
<P><HI>Innocent</HI> the second, finding divers Car∣dinallships void, began first to make many Cardinalls together, which was continued untill about four hundred years since; at
<PB N="111" REF="61"/> which time the number of Cardinalls seeming to be too great, they began when Cardinalls dyed, not to put others in their roomes, but to give them in <HI>commen∣dum</HI> to other Cardinals or leave the Go∣vernment of them to the Cardinalls Arch∣priests; so that in processe of time it came to that passe, as no longer minding the antient number of fifty three, they grew to be exceedingly diminished: howbeit, Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, not only restored them to the said number again, but it was by him, and Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third, and Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth exceeded, insomuch that the eight and twenty titles of the Priests Cardinalls not sufficing, Pope <HI>Leo</HI> made thirteen, Pope <HI>Iulian</HI> the third, three, and Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fourth one more: Now it is to be noted, that before Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> they never exceeded the number of fifty and three.</P>
<P>It was an antient custome observed in the Church, for fourteen hundred yeers together, that no opposition was amongst the Cardinalls; for a Deacon made not himselfe a Priest, unlesse he lost his Dea∣conship, and then took upon him the title of Priest; and in like sort, if a Priest became a Bishop, he left the title of Priest,
<PB N="102" REF="62"/> but continuing a Priest he never changed his title, neither a Bishop his Bishoprick, nor a Deacon his Deaconship.</P>
<P>One of those actions sprang from the Schisme of the Councell of <HI>Pisa,</HI> where the Cardinall yeelding to the one and the o∣ther obedience, some Cardinals of <HI>Avigni∣on</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> being of the same Cardinall∣ship, it was necessary that one of them should relinquish his, and for this they be∣gan afterwards to change, which hath been the ruine of the Churches, where there were Titles of Deaconships.</P>
<P>It was an ancient custome likewise, which lasted five hundred yeares, even to the time of Pope <HI>Sixtus quartus,</HI> that a Dea∣con should have no title, nor a Priest a Deaconship, it being a thing repugnant to give the cure of soules to a Deacon, and to a Priest a Deaconship.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Sixtus quartus</HI> was the first that confounded this Cardinalship, giving to Priests Deaconships, &amp; titles to Deacons; and the matter went so farre forward, that there is not a title, which hath not had a Deacon: wherein yet is to be noted, that the Deacon, although he hath a title, as the Cardinall <HI>Montallo</HI> had of <HI>San Lorenso in Domaso,</HI> yet hee useth not the name of
<PB N="113" REF="62"/> title, as to say, <HI>Alexander Sancti Laurentii, &amp; Damaso Diaconus Cardinalis,</HI> without men∣tion of the title: and contrarily the Priest Cardinall, that hath a Deaconship, where∣as he ought to speake of the title, not be∣cause it hath no title, yet he adjoynes it, as <HI>Jacobus Sabellus</HI> of the title, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of the habit of the Cardinalls.</HEAD>
<P>THe Cardinals, before <HI>Innocent</HI> the fourth, untill the yeare a thousand, two hundred and fifty, went in the ordi∣nary habit of a Priest, like to that of the Monks. <HI>Innocent</HI> the fourth first of all ad∣ded to it the red Hatt; afterwards, in the time of <HI>Boniface</HI> the ninth, they had the red and violet habit, in the same manner and forme as it is used at this day. Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the second gave the Myter of silke, the red cap, the red cloth for the Mule, and guilt stirrops. <HI>Gregory</HI> the fourteenth gave the red cap to the Regular Cardinalls, going otherwaies apparelled in that colour, which those of the order, whereof they were then used, but of the same fashion and stuffe as the other Cardinals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> howbeit they wore no Roche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="114" REF="63"/> sock of cloth; and when they adorne themselves, instead of a Rochet they put on a coate with wide sleeves, and adorne themselves over that; the other Cardi∣nalls, which are not Regulars, put on the <HI>Ammitts</HI> over the Rochet, which they weare ordinarily, &amp; then their ornaments; in like manner the Regular Cardinal ought to put on the <HI>Ammitt</HI> over the Coat. The shaven Crowne is the common badge of all the Clergy men; the Manipule is the badge of the Subdeacon; the crosse-Stole of the Deacon; the Planeta of the Priest; the Myter of the Bishop; the Pall of the Arch∣bishop, of the Primate, &amp; of the Patriarch; and the Diadem of the Pope, which for sixe hundred yeares together was adorned with onely one Crowne, but at the returne of the Apostolick Sea from <HI>Avignion</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> the Popes began to weare the triple Crowne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Creation of the Cardinalls.</HEAD>
<P>THe Pope doth use to make Cardi∣nalls two severall waies; the first is this: Those persons which are abiding in <HI>Rome,</HI> whom his Holinesse purposeth to
<PB N="115" REF="63"/> promote, have notice given them thereof over night by the Cardinall Nephewes, whereupon the next morning they repaire to the Palace at the usuall houre.</P>
<P>The Pope, when as the secret Consistory is shut up, pronunceth the Cardinalls, whom he intends to make; and in the same Consistory causes them to bee called in, where kneeling downe at his Holines feet, the Pope puts the red hatt on his head, and making the signe of the Crosse on it, hee sayes to him, <HI>Esto Cardinalis,</HI> and weare this red hatt, as a signe, that thou wilt without feare expose thy self even to death, and the effusion of thy dearest bloud, for the exalta∣tion of the holy faith, for the peace &amp; qui∣et of Christian people, and augmenting the state of the holy Roman Church; in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then the new Car∣dinall takes off the Hatt from his head, and kisseth his Holinesse feet.</P>
<P>The second way is this. In the secret Consistory the Pope pronounceth in order of dignitie the Cardinalls which he hath made, and then gives a list of them to the Cardinall Nephew, who sends his Master of the Chamber with his owne Coach to fetch those persons which are promoted,
<PB N="116" REF="64"/> from out of such parts of the City as they live in, and bring them to his Eminencies Lodgings. There they have their Crowns shaven, and are attyred in purple like Cardinalls; the garments wherewith they were apparrelled before are the vailes of the Cardinall Nephewes adjutants of the Chamber; and the Cardinall Nephewes Barber that shaved their crownes receives from them five and twenty duckets for his fee. After dinner the same Cardinall ha∣ving feasted the new Cardinalls, conducts them to his Holinesse, before whose feet kneeling on their knees they have the red hatt put upon their heads in the manner before declared; and after many words of humility, and thanks, they depart away: and so goe all in the habit of a Cardinall together to visit his Holinesse kinsfolks, as∣well men as women continuing afterwards in their houses untill the publique Consi∣story, alwaies cloathed in purple till the day of the said Consistory, though it bee <HI>extra tempora,</HI> and giving audience to every one that comes to visit them. Now all the time before the publique Consistory the new Cardinall ought not to accompany any one, and if he does so, he does ill; for al∣beit Cardinalls come to visit him, he can∣not,
<PB N="117" REF="64"/> nor ought not to accompany them farther then the Chamber doore, where hee received the visit: But the ancient good rule was, that the Cardinalls did not visit the new. Cardinalls before the pub∣lique Consistory; and if they chanced to doe it, by occasion of kindred, as other∣waies, they went to them by night, and were not seene.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of those that are made Cardinalls being absent from <HI>Rome.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE, who in his Holinesse name is adver∣tised, that he is created a Cardinall, must presently cause a shaven Crowne to be made him, and himselfe as a Car∣dinall, but in purple; for hee may not use red, untill he have received the hatt sent unto him by the Pope: and from that time he is to be called Cardinall, and so he may subscribe himselfe.</P>
<P>The red hatt is alwaies carried by one of the Popes Chamberlaines, accompanied with his Holinesse <HI>Brieve,</HI> for which the new Cardinall payes an hundred duckets to the Chamber. Now the ceremonie of conferring the hatt upon him, is perfor∣med,
<PB N="118" REF="65"/> where there is no <HI>Nuntio</HI> by the Em∣peror, the King, the Arch-Bishop, or Bi∣shop of the place.</P>
<P>The newes of the Cardinalship, before the Hat is brought, together with the Popes, or one of his Nephews letters, is carried by a Currier, unto whom a good reward is given, as also to the Chamber∣laine that brings the Hat, there is a great reward also given, which usually, from them who are present in <HI>Rome</HI> at their pro∣motion, is at least five hundred Duckats, and from them which receive the Hat out of <HI>Rome,</HI> a thousand Duckats, with three hundred more at the publick consistory, when they are confirmed in their Dignity; which reward is divided amongst the se∣cret participant Chamberlaines; and to the Chamberlain that carried the Hat, belongs an equall share, although he be none of the participants. Of the rewards given to the Currier are three parts made, one to the Cardinall Nephews secretary, one to the Master Generall of the Posts, and the third to the Currier himselfe, the expence of the voyage being first deduct∣ed out of it.</P>
<P>The Cardinall which goes to <HI>Rome</HI> to take the Hatt, is to goe in the travelling
<PB N="119" REF="65"/> habit of a Cardinall, but of purple colour, and on his head an ordinary hatt, with a Gold band, and faced with red silk: being arrived at <HI>Rome</HI> he will be mett with the Caroches, which the Cardinalls send, and in particular with the Cardinal Nephews, wherein he shall be conducted to the Apo∣stolicall Palace, &amp; being come to the said Cardinall Nephews Lodgings, he must complement with his eminencie, and then by his Barber, he must have the Cardinals shaven crowne made on his head, and putting off his travelling habit, he must put on a long Robe with a Rochet, and so he must be conducted by his Eminency to the Pope, upon the sight of whom, the new Cardinall must kneel down before him, and then after other bowings of him∣selfe; he must goe and kiss his Holinesse feet, and hand; that done, having been admitted <HI>ad osculum,</HI> used many words of thankfulnesse for the dignity of a Cardi∣nall conferred on him, and taken leave of his Holinesse, he must accompany the Cardinall Nephew to his lodgings, where he must complement him anew, and from thence he must goe and visit the Popes Kinsfolks, who most commonly dwell in places remote from his Palace.</P>
<PB N="120" REF="66"/>
<P>Having performed all this, he must re∣paire to his owne house, out of which he may not stir untill his Holinesse give him a publick Consistory; howbeit, he may in the mean time receive visits, but privately without going forth of his Chamber, and without accompanying the visitors, let them be what they will, as is delivered before.</P>
<P>On the day of the publick Consistory, the accustomed pompe of the solemne riding is used, and the new Cardinall, if he be an Arch-Bishop or Bishop, wears on his head a black Pontificall hatt, faced with Green; but if he were before only a Priest, a Prelate, or of the short robe, he must wear a hat in the same manner, but faced with black, and must go attired in red, if the day doe permit it; and his cloake must be of raterd Grogeram, being accompanied with all the Cardinalls, and so he goes to receive the red Hat from the hands of his Holinesse: In which solemni∣ties many ceremonies occurre, but one cannot erre therein, because all is guided by the Masters of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>The same day, the Popes Cardinall Nephew feasts the new Cardinall; he is afterwards to visit the whole sacred Col∣ledge
<PB N="121" REF="66"/> with all his traine, and in his habit, begining at the Deacon Cardinall, and then the rest one after another, without order: and in the same habit he is to re∣ceive, and render the visits of, and to the Ambassadors of Kings, and Princes, and o∣ther great personages.</P>
<P>In the first secret Consistory, after the publick Consistory, the Pope performes the ceremony of shutting up the new Cardinalls mouth, his Holinesse speaking and praying, and the new Cardinall not saying a word. This shutting up of the mouth, deprives the new Cardinall of his active and passive voice.</P>
<P>In the second Consistory, his Holinesse opens his mouth, declares his title unto him, and espouses him with a Gold Ring, that hath a Saphire set in it, for which in times past, the Cardinals heir (in case he dyed) paid five hundred duckats in the Chamber: Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth gave this fee of the Ring to the German Colledge of <HI>Rome,</HI> but afterwards Pope <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> took it from thence, and by <HI>Gregory</HI> the fifteenth, it was assigned to the sacred Colledge <HI>de propaganda fide,</HI> and it was by a Pontificall Bull ordained, that it should be alwaies done by every Car∣dinall
<PB N="122" REF="67"/> from the very day of his promoti∣on.</P>
<P>Any one that shall be made a Cardinall, and before his coming to <HI>Rome</HI> shall be de∣clared a Legat; he may exercise his Legat∣ship, if his Holinesse pleasure be not o∣therwise, untill he hath first the Hat; and in that case the Pope useth to send it unto him with a <HI>Brieve:</HI> afterwards when that Legation is finished, and that the same Cardinall comes to <HI>Rome,</HI> he is at any hand to have a publique Consistory granted to him, together with the wonted solemn riding. Every Cardinall hath the Hatt, which his Holinesse puts on his head, brought home to him to his house by a secret Chamberlain, in a silver and gilt Bason, that is carried by the Popes cup∣bord-keeper, unto whom is used to be given a reward of five and twenty crowns of Gold.</P>
<P>Besides these, the new Cardinall is to give the rewards which are mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>Every Cardinall passeth the Bull of his Cardinalship, which being subscribed by the Pope, and all the Cardinals present in <HI>Rome,</HI> the usuall seale of lead is put to it, and sometimes one of Gold.</P>

<HEAD>The Order which is observed, when a Cardinall dyes.</HEAD>
<P>WHen a Cardinall is deceased, he is carried by night to the Church which is nearest to the place where he dy∣ed, and is layd on a high scaffold upon a counterpoint of mourning cloth of gold, a∣dorned with sacred ornaments, of that sort which the order of his Cardinalship required, and the wonted Myter on his head, and at his feet his pontificall red Hat. The next day after dinner, the whole fraternity of Friers goe to the same Church, and there say the Office of the dead over him; during the which the Car∣dinalls in purple habits, and cloakes of the same colour enter into the Church, where after they have prayed to the Holy Sacra∣ment they goe to the feet of the Corps, and sprinkling it with holy water, they say the Pater-noster, with the prayer, <HI>Absolve Do∣mine,</HI> &amp;c. and so repaire to, and sit downe in their ordinary seates: All this is done by every Cardinall severally if they come in single, but if many come in together, then the most ancient of them performes the ceremony for all the rest that are pre∣sent in the Church.</P>
<PB N="128" REF="70"/>
<P>The foure Masters of the Ceremonies waite upon the Corps, in their upper gar∣ments of fine purple Say; as likewise all the Apparitors in long purple habits down to the ground, with silver maces in their hands, and for a reward each of them hath a Priests Cap given him: There are also standing two of the dead Cardinalls Pal∣freymen, clothed in mourning, carrying two banners of black Taffeta, with the de∣ceased Cardinalls Armes on them. The Church too is all hung with black, and the same Armes, together with the trophees used in Funeralls.</P>
<P>They are buried for the most part in the Churches of their Titles; and he that will have it done with pompe, hath, besides the fraternity with great lights, the Ma∣ster of the Houshold, the assistant Pre∣lates, and participant Apostolicall Proto∣notaries, riding pontifically on their Mules; together with their Masters of the Cere∣monies, and his Holinesse Family, in long red robes, namely the Squires and Cham∣berlaines extraordinary. And this cere∣mony is alwaies performed about two of the clock in the night. But such as will be buried without Pompe, are carried to the place, where they are to be interred, about
<PB N="129" REF="70"/> two howers within night secretly in a Coach.</P>
<P>Cardinalls which are of great families, and have rich kindred, have their obse∣quies celebratedi n the Churches, where they are buried, with stately Horses, where all the sacred Colledge assist at the saying of Masse, making Orations in the praise of of the Cardinall deceased, and perfor∣ming all the other Ceremonies before re∣lated.</P>
<P>The assistant Prelates are such Patri∣arches, Archbishops, as his Holinesse de∣clares to be so: their Office is to assist and serve the person of the Pope in the ponti∣ficall Chappells, in holding the Missal, and candle to him; as also in singing Masse be∣fore him, at such time as it doth not be∣long to the Cardinalls to doe it. In his Ho∣linesse Chappell they have the chiefe place next to the Cardinalls, and are reckoned as a part of the Popes family, having a dai∣ly allowance of the bread, wafers, and wine of the Palace. Vpon the first Masse, that one of these Prelates sings in the Chappell Pontifically, he is to give a great reward to the Masters of the Ceremonies, &amp; to others of the Chappell.</P>

<HEAD>Of the manner of shutting and opening a new Cardinals mouth.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first Consistory, the Pope shuts the new Cardinalls mouth, and prohi∣bits him from presuming to speak any thing in the Consistories, or Councells, untill such time as by the advice of his Brethren he shall be induced to open his mouth.</P>
<P>In the second or third Consistory, the Pope useth to open his mouth in this manner. After all the Cardinals, both old and new, are there congregated together, the Pope commands the new Cardinals to goe forth, which accordingly they doe, and in a decent place without the Con∣sistory wait his Holinesse pleasure where∣upon the Pope propounds unto the old Cardinals, whether it seemes fit unto them that the mouths of the new Cardinalls should be opened, and they severally con∣senting, the new Cardinalls are called in again: Then the Pope exhorts the new Cardinalls, standing before him, with words full of Fatherly love, to behave themselves gravely, courteously, and dis∣creetly in all things, to speak in the Con∣sistories
<PB N="131" REF="71"/> with reverence and modesty, to deliver their opinions, not by way of con∣tradicting and impugning that of others, but respectfully observing every one to declare their minds with that judgment and wisdome, which the Lord should vouchsafe to indue them withall, to have God alwaies before their eyes in giving their counsells and votes, to govern their houses and families with all moderation and honesty, not suffering in them any gamsters, quarellers, riotous, or infamous persons; for that commonly the vices of the Master, do appear in the lives of the servants, according to the saying, such as the King is, such are the people; to bestow themselves when they are free from pub∣lick affaires, in the Study of good Letters; and alwaies to have some part of the holy Scriptures read at their Tables. This ex∣hortation ended, he opens their mouths, saying: We open your mouths to speak in all Councells, in Electing of the high Bi∣shop, and in all acts, both within the Con∣sistory, and without it, which appertains to Cardinalls, and which they are used to exercise, in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.</P>
<P>This done, the new Cardinalls approch∣ing
<PB N="132" REF="72"/> one after another to the Pope, the first of them kneels down before his Holinesse, who taking a pretious Ring, prepared for that purpose, puts it on the Ring finger of the new Cardinals right hand, saying: To the honour of Almighty God, &amp; of the Ho∣ly Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; <HI>Paul,</HI> we commit unto thee, the Church of Saint <HI>N.</HI> together with the Clergy, people, and Chappels thereof, according to the forme wherewith it u∣seth to be committed to Cardinals, which have the title of the said Church.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Election of the Apostolicall Legat <HI>de Latere.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Pope doth in the secret Consisto∣rie propound the causes for which the creation of Legats seemeth necessary unto him, and requires his brethren to vote whether any shall be created, and how many: After they are agreed of them, they name the persons, who upon their nomination goe straightway out of the Consistory; and when the Fathers have resolved who they shall be, they are called in againe: Then his holinesse as they are all sitting, declares unto them one by one
<PB N="133" REF="72"/> how considing in his prudence, wisdome, vertue, &amp;c. he hath with the advice of his Brethren designed him to be an Apostoli∣call Legat into such parts, and enjoyns him to take the charge thereof upon him. Now he unto whom the Pope addresseth his speech, riseth up on his feet, and when he hath done speaking unto him, he, with his Hat off, gives the Pope, and the sacred Colledge many humble thanks for their good opinion of him, notwithstand∣ing his insufficiency; and with modest words excuseth himselfe, and desireth them to commit that charge to some such person, as is more experienced, and better fitted for it then he: But the Pope still pressing it upon him, at length he offereth his obedience to his Holinesse pleasure; and reiterating his thanks unto him, he falls downe on his knees before him, and kissing his feet and hand, he is received <HI>ad Osculum Oris,</HI> both by the Pope and all the Cardinalls, who doe afterwards go, and accompany him to his house, where he prepares himselfe for his journey, be∣ing in the meane time visited by all the Cardinalls. The day of his departure come, a secret Consistory is held, at the end whereof, taking leave of his Holinesse,
<PB N="134" REF="73"/> he is conducted by all the Cardinalls to the gate of the City, and there having given them thanks, and kissed them all one after another, he goes away in peace. After the Cardinall Legat hath past out of the Territory of the City, where the Pope resides, he begins to blesse, puts on a red Cloak, and hath the Crosse carried before him. Now all the while that he is in his Legation, he doth not participate of the emoluments of the Apostolicall Chamber, or of the Annats.</P>

<P>POpe <HI>Clement</HI> the eight with much prudence ordained, that a person de∣stined to a Church in Italy, should go and submit himselfe to the examination of certain Cardinals, Prelates, Divines, and Canonists. Now this is the order which is observed with a person that is destinated to a Church: he must go to his examinati∣on before his Holinesse, where he must be all the while upon his knees, kneeling on a Cushion: If he doth not carry him∣selfe well, he is rejected; if he doth carry
<PB N="135" REF="73"/> himselfe well, they approve of him, and he is interrogated in that faculty, whereof he hath taken the degree of Doctor, or of some other which he hath made profession of. The examination then ended, and he approved of, the Pope appoints some Car∣dinall to propound that Church; but be∣fore it comes to the proposition, these things ensuing are to be done.</P>
<P>First, the person destinated must make profession of his faith, before the Cardi∣nall Ponente; then in the presence of his Eminencie must the oath be given to the witnesses which are to be examined, as∣well concerning the state of that Church, as of the qualitie, birth, and manners of the person destinated to be Bishop thereof: That done, the Cardinall gives order to his Auditor for the drawing up of the processe, which is made by the Cardinall Vicars, or the Auditor of the Chambers Notary: howbeit, he that is destinated to the Church, must first produce the privi∣ledge of his Doctorship, and others, if he have any, as Patents and such like, which may any way make for him, then are the witnesses to attest, that he is borne of law∣full marriage, that his Parents were ne∣ver suspected of heresy, and that he is a∣bove
<PB N="136" REF="74"/> thirty years of age, according as it is ordained by the Councell of <HI>Trent, de vita, et moribus.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, other witnesses are exami∣ned concerning the estate of that Church; as what is the revenue of it, of what quali∣tie the Citty and Province is, wherin it is seated; and whether it be immediatly subject to the Apostolique Sea, or els is a suffraganship of some Arch-Bishoprick.</P>
<P>What Lands and Towns it hath in its Diocesse, how many thousands of soules it containes, how many Monasteries and Reliques there are in it, what Clergy, how many Canons and dignities, how many Convents of Friers and Nuns, how many Parishes, how many Bells, and how many such like things it hath.</P>
<P>The Processe being compiled, the Car∣dinall Ponents subscribes it, and then sends it to be reviewed by the three Cardinals, heads of their Order, who having review∣ed it, subscribe it also, and so return it to the Cardinall Ponents, with whom it al∣waies afterwards remains: In the first Con∣sistory, then it is published, and in the next following, it is propounded, deli∣vering briefly in Latin that which is con∣tained in the Processe. Now before the
<PB N="137" REF="74"/> Cardinal Ponents propounds the Church, two Schedules are sent to the Caster up of the accompts of the sacred Colledge, which are made at the instance of the per∣son elected, who therein promiseth to pay unto the Cardinall Ponents, to the sacred Colledge, to the reverend Chamber, and to the Officers of the Chancery, all the mo∣ney which is to be payd for the dispatches in the passing of that Church.</P>
<P>The day before the Consistory of the proposition, the Cardinall Ponents sends a memoriall by one to all the Cardinalls, wherein is succinctly set forth all that is expressed in the Processe; to the end, that if any Cardinall will say ought against it, he may know what he hath to speak of. When as the Cardinall Ponents have fini∣shed the proposition, the Pope turnes to the Deacon Cardinall, and asketh him whether he hath any thing to say in con∣tradiction of it; unto which, rising up on his feet, his Eminency answers no; where∣upon his Holinesse decrees that Church to such an one. Of all this, the Cardinall vice-Chancellor takes cognizance, and af∣terwards gives forth the Decree made in the Consistory; upon which decree, the Cardinall Ponents frames the Schedule
<PB N="138" REF="75"/> subscribed with his hand, by vertue whereof, together with another like it, made by the Cardinall vice-chancellor, and called the contra-Schedule, the <HI>Bulls</HI> are dispatched.</P>
<P>The person propounded, is not to goe out of his house that morning when his proposition is to be made, but then is to have his Crowne shaven; after dinner he must attire himselfe in the purple habit of a Bishop, and so go to the Popes Palace, where by the Lord Master of the Cham∣ber he is brought to kisse the feet of his Holinesse, who with his owne hands, puts the Rochet, which Bishops use to weare, upon him, and then he is to give the Pope thanks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After this, the new Bishop is to visit all the sacred Colledge, beginning at the Deacon-Cardinall, whom he must alwaies visit first; for the rest, he needeth not to observe any order, but to visit them one after another as it shall fall out: The next he is to visit, are the governors of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Auditor of the Chamber, the Treasurer-Generall, and the <HI>Datarie,</HI> from whom he is to procure the Patent <HI>dell' Alternative,</HI> before he departs to his residence.</P>
<P>From the day he received the Rochet,
<PB N="139" REF="75"/> he is stiled Elect, and assoon as he is con∣secrated he is absolutely called Bishop, but not before. Arch-Bishops are not E∣lect untill the Pall be given to them.</P>
<P>There are to be three Bishops to the Consecration; he that consecrates, who for the most part is a Cardinall, and two o∣ther Bishops likewise consecrators: In the day of the consecration the new Bishop precedes the other more antient Bishops, in regard it is the day of his nuptialls; and ordinarily, that Cardinall which conse∣crates, invites the consecrated Bishop to dinner, as also the assistant Bishops, the Master of the Ceremonies, and some others.</P>
<P>Every Arch-Bishop, or Bishop, ere he be consecrated, must before the Prime Deacon Cardinall, sweare upon the Evan∣gelists fealtie to the Apostolique Sea, and obedience to the Roman high Bishop, and this is required to be done by the Master of the Ceremonies, in the presence of wit∣nesses; during the performance whereof, the said Cardinall sits in his seat with his Hatt on, and the Prelate is bare-headed, kneeling on a cushion.</P>
<P>All these things before mentioned doth the Arch-Bishop also, yea something more; for a Consistoriall Advocate demands the
<PB N="140" REF="76"/> Pall for him in the secret Consistory, and and then the said Arch-Bishop enters into the secret Consistory for it: If the Arch-Bishop be not present in <HI>Rome,</HI> he takes it <HI>per procuratorem.</HI></P>
<P>All these Prelates, untill they are con∣secrated, may not wear a Ring with a rich stone in it on their finger, nor when they celebrate Masse may they have any other vesture, save only that of a Priest; neither may they performe any other ce∣remony, which Bishops use to doe.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Arch-Bishop and Bishop is to goe into the Chancerie, and kneeling bare-headed on his knees, must once more swear before the Lord Regent of the Chancerie (who sits with his hatt on his head, as in like manner do all the other Prelates, which are named Abbreviators <HI>di Parco Magiore</HI>) to be obedient to the ho∣ly Mother the Church, and to the high Bishop, as he did formerly before the Prince Deacon Cardinall; if any of them be absent in that case, all is dispatched by a <HI>Bull</HI> containing the same, and they are to performe every of those things, except it be going to examination, <HI>per procuratorem.</HI></P>
<P>The Cardinalls are exempted, aswell from doing all that is before mentioned,
<PB N="141" REF="76"/> as going to be examined, their dispatches being made by a secret way: And when any of them is to be provided of some Church, he is provided of it in the Consi∣story by his Holinesse: whensoever the Pope propounds either Cardinalls, or no Cardinals, there is no processe, much lesse any publication thereof, his attestation of the person by word of mouth sufficing.</P>
<P>The Cardinall Ponents hath ordained <HI>de jure</HI> fifteene duckets of the Chamber for every hundred, whereat that Church which is propounded by him is taxed: but when as his Holinesse propounds one, that fee goes to the Apostolicall Secretaries; &amp; when he propounds a Church in a person of a Cardinall, that was never at <HI>Rome,</HI> he must pay fifteene in the hundred, but if he be present in <HI>Rome,</HI> or hath been there at other times, he is exempted from such pay∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Archbishops Pall, and the tra∣dition thereof.</HEAD>
<P>SUch as are promoted to be Metropoli∣tan Churches, are not called (though they be consecrated Bishops,) either Arch∣bishops
<PB N="142" REF="77"/> or Patriarchs, nor may they in the meane time consecrate, celebrate a Synod, or exercise many other Pontificall functions, before they receive the Pall, taken from the body of blessed <HI>Peter;</HI> which they are to demand by themselves, or their Proctor, within the space of sixe moneths. The care of making and keep∣ing the Palls appertaines to the Aposto∣licall Subdeacons, who make them of pure and white wooll in this manner. The Nunnes of Saint <HI>Annes</HI> Monastery do offer every yeare two white Lambes on the Al∣tar of that Church in the Festivall day of Saint <HI>Anne,</HI> whilst the <HI>Agnus Dei</HI> is singing in solemne Masse. Now those two lambes are delivered to the Canons of the La∣teranens Churches, and are afterwards consigned by them to the Apostolicall Subdeacons, who put them to feede in certaine pastures, untill the time of shea∣ring them be come: then they sheare off their wooll, and mixing it with other like pure and white wooll, they spin it into yarne, wherewith the Palls are woven three fingers broad into an orbicular form, so as it may compasse the Archbishops shoulders: The Pall hath a kind of labell hanging down before to the brest, and two
<PB N="143" REF="77"/> more behind, on each shoulder one, hang∣ing downe to the reines, an hands breadth and an halfe long; upon the end whereof are thin leaden plates of the same breadth, round at the bottom, which are covered over with black taffeta, that is sowed downe upon the said pendant labells be∣fore and behind. The Palls being made after this sort by the Subdeacons, they are carried to the Cathedrall Church of the Prince of the Apostles, and by the Ca∣nons thereof are laid upon the bodies of the Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> under the high Altar, where being watched one night, according to the wonted custome, they are taken from thence, and restored againe to the Subdeacons, who carefully keep them in a convenient and decent place. The use of the Pall, so far as we can finde, is very ancient, and had its originall from Pope <HI>Linus,</HI> the immediate Successor of the Apostle <HI>Peter;</HI> for so we reade writ∣ten by Bishop <HI>Maximus</HI> in an Homilie of the Sacerdotall vesture, who there saith, our Patriarkes doe hold that our Ephod (namely the Pall) was instituted by <HI>Linus,</HI> the second Roman Bishop after <HI>Peter,</HI> and given by God to our Prelates for a singular and speciall priviledge of power. And
<PB N="144" REF="78"/> <HI>Eusebius Caesariensis</HI> in a sermon of the <HI>Epi∣phany</HI> writeth thus; Nothing is more an∣cient then that Sacerdotall vesture of our Prelates, which succeeded to that made of the silke and gold in the old Testament, wherewith <HI>Linus</HI> first of all was adorned, in signe of plenary power, and whereunto as we have received from ancient writers, he gave the types, and name, calling it a Pall. When as any Prelate wants the Pall, it is first demanded by some one of the Consistoriall Advocates, whom to that end he hath especially constituted for his Proctor, of the Pope in the secret Consi∣storie with much instance. The Pope ha∣ving commanded the Advocate forth, re∣quireth the opinion of the Fathers, whe∣ther the Pall shall be given accordingly, or no: Then he committs to the chiefe Dea∣con-Cardinall the consigning of the Pall to the said Prelate, or his Proctor; where∣upon the said Cardinall appoints the place and day, where, and when the Pall shall be consigned, which for the most part is in the Chappell of the said Cardinalls house, but sometimes in Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church at the high Altar. The day being appoin∣ted, the Prelate comes to the place ordai∣ned, where are present the Deacon Cardi∣nall,
<PB N="145" REF="78"/> and the Apostolicall Subdeacon with the Pall, which he spreads over the midst of the Altar. Then the Prelate kneeling on the stepps of the Altar before the said Deacon Cardinall, prayeth the Pall may be given unto him in these words: <HI>I. N.</HI> Elect of the Church of <HI>N.</HI> do most instant∣ly desire, that the Pall, taken from the bo∣dy of blessed <HI>Peter,</HI> wherein is the pleni∣tude of the Pontificall Office, may be con∣signed unto me. Vpon this the said Deacon Cardinall taking the Pall from off the Al∣tar, puts it upon the shoulders of the Pre∣late, kneeling still on his knees, saying; <HI>To the honour of Almighty God, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and of the blessed Apostles</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> Paul, <HI>and also of our holy Father the Pope, and of the holy Church, we give thee this Pall, taken from the body of blessed</HI> Peter, <HI>wherin is the pleni∣tude of the Pontificall Office, together with the title of Archbishop, that thou maist use it on cer∣taine dayes, which are expressed in the priviled∣ges granted by the Sea Apostolicall in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen.</HI> This said, he is admitted by the said Dea∣con Cardinall <HI>ad osculum pacis;</HI> then the Master of the ceremonies takes the Pall from off his shoulders, and having before witnesses made an act of that which hath
<PB N="146" REF="79"/> past, he folds up the Pall, and carries it to the said Prelate, or reserves it in some sa∣cred place, untill the Prelate goes away, and then gives him the Pall, together with the publick instrument drawne thereup∣on.</P>
<P>They who are to receive the Pall, after it is demanded, and granted to him in the Consistory, do usually compound with the sub-Deacons, who, as we have said, do keep the Palls, and do receive from the Prelats, sometimes more, some∣times lesse in the hundred, according to the valew and taxation of the Church: The Masters of the Ceremonies too, in re∣gard of their Office, and the drawing up of the instrument, have certain fees, ac∣cording to the proportion of the valew, and taxation of the Churches, but not so much as the sub-Deacons.</P>

<HEAD>Of the publick consistory.</HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as we have mentioned the publick Consistory, and may do so a∣gain hereafter, we have thought meet to explain the order and manner of the same. In the Apostolicall Palace there are two
<PB N="147" REF="79"/> Pontificall Halls, which are contained in the Conclave, the greatest of them is used to be furnished, and made ready for the publick Consistory, when as either Kings or their Ambassadors are to be received, and the Canonization of a Saint is to be celebrated. In the other hall, are the Am∣bassadors of Princes, &amp; common-wealths, when they come to yield obedience to the Pope, received; as also the Apostolicall Legats, returning from their Legations, and new Cardinalls coming to the Roman Court: In it too are the new Cardinals published, and all causes handled which require a publick Consistory. At the upper end of the Hall, is a Pontificall Throne erected, with an ascent of three ample steps unto it, the forme of the Throne is almost foure-square, and about twelve hand-breadths broad, in the midst where∣of is a seat joyning to the Wall, with a great and little foot-stoole; all the floor of the Throne is covered with Scarlet cloth, and so is the great footstool, but the Wall is adorned with cloth of Gold, and likwise the seat, over which hangs a cloth of State of the same stuffe; on the right hand within the Throne are the seats of the Bishops, and Priests Cardinalls, two
<PB N="148" REF="80"/> hands breadth from the Wall, having a back to lean against as high as their shoul∣ders, and a step seven or eight fingers high to set their feet upon, unto which is ad∣joyning another seat, that stands athwart the Hall, so that they who sit upon it do look the Pope in the face: On his holinesse left hand is the seat of the Deacons-Car∣dinalls, betwixt the which and the seat that goes crosse the Hall, is a void space, about an eleven or twelve hands-breadth, which serves as a door into the entrance of the Consistory. These seats are adorned with Arras and Tapestry, and are of one and the same length and breadth; all the room about the seats is overspread with green cloth.</P>
<P>The Pope goes to the publick Consisto∣ry arrayed in the same manner as he goes to the Chappell, with the Crosse and Car∣dinals preceding him; when he comes there, he sits downe in his seat, and so do the Cardinalls in theirs, after they have done their accustomed obeisance to his Holinesse. The Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Pronotaries and all the Prelates, sit upon the three Steps of the Pontificall Throne, and with them last of all the Sub-deacons, Auditors, and Clerks of the Chamber:
<PB N="149" REF="80"/> The long robed Courtiers sit on the ground between the Cardinals seats; the Chamberlaines and Secretaries do sit also on the ground, betwixt the Prelates, and the long robed Courtiers: If the Popes Nephews, or some great Princes are pre∣sent, which are not to sit on the Cardinals seats, they stand neare to the Pope: The Ambassadors of Kings, and Princes, and great noblemen, stand on the Popes right hand, between the steps of the Throne and the Wall; the Popes domestick ser∣vants, and Courtiers, stand on his left hand between the steps of the Throne and the Wall: the Consistoriall Advo∣cates, stand behind the Priests and Dea∣cons-Cardinall seats: the Procurators of Kings, Princes, and religious orders, stand behind the Bishops-Cardinalls seat, betwixt the Wall and the seat; in the space between the Priests, and Deacons-Cardinalls seats stand the Sergeants at arms, as it were at the door of the Con∣sistory, and there do they that are to come unto the Pope enter: The Master of the sacred shoushold stands before the Ser∣geants at armes, at the end of the Priests Cardinalls seat, and in the head of the Deacons-Cardinalls seat, are the Masters
<PB N="150" REF="81"/> of the Ceremonies, that they may be al∣waies ready to execute the Popes com∣mands, and to give order for any thing that is to be done.</P>
<P>When the Consistory is held for judi∣ciall causes, which the Pope useth to do, at such time as it is not held for other causes, the Proponent Advocate stands behinde the Priests Cardinalls seat just opposite to the Pope, and opening his cause, doth in the end cast the Schedule of his supplication amongst the long robed Courtiers which sit on the ground, who transmit it unto the hands of the vice-Chancellor: Now if any of the other Ad∣vocats will contradict him, and answer for his adversary upon the finishing of the de∣bate, the Pope answers plainly by word of mouth <HI>Placet,</HI> or with a limitation, that he will advise upon it, and the vice-Chan∣cellor with his owne hand signes the sup∣plication, according to the Popes answer, and writes the same downe in a Booke, which he hath alwaies there by him; causes being so dispatched, all riseup, and the Pope returnes to his Chamber, in the same manner as he came.</P>

<HEAD>Of the secret Consistory.</HEAD>
<P>THe secret Consistory is held in some remoter roome of the Apostolicall Palace, at this day called the Papall Cham∣ber; where in the midst of it is a Pontifi∣call seate erected against the wall, which is raised from the ground without steps or degrees; and hath a great footstoole, on which the the Pope setts his feet, and ano∣ther litle one, whereby one may ascend higher. The Cardinals seats are placed be∣fore the Pope, on the right, &amp; left hand, eve∣ryone in its order. The Popes seate is ador∣ned with cloth of gold; the Cardinalls seates are bare, but painted red with his Holinesse Armes upon them. The place between the Popes seate and the Cardinals is usually covered with tapestry. The ju∣nior Deacon Cardinall hath a little bell by him, wherewith hee gives notice to the Keepers of the Consistory, if the Pope or Fathers will have them to doe any thing. In the space between the Cardinalls seates are two formes placed round at a pretty di∣stance the one from the other, untill all are come in, so that the Cardinals may betwixt
<PB N="152" REF="82"/> them, as through a doore, passe to their seates; but when all of them are congre∣gated, those two formes are put close to∣gether againe in their place. When as Con∣sistoriall matters begin to be treated of; all other Prelates, besides the Cardinalls are shut out. Two secret Chamberlaines waite without at the doore of the Consi∣story, that they may bee ready upon the ringing the bell, for any command. The Pope propounds such businesses as are to be handled in the Senate, and in order re∣quires their opinions, which are called votes, then each of them rising up gives his vote; whereupon his Holinesse, accor∣ding to the major part, decrees.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Conclave.</HEAD>
<P>THe place of the Conclave (for so is that called at this day wherein the Fathers are shutt up for election of the Pope) is in the Apostolicall Palace; and it containes two Halls, and Chappells, with some other roomes, and houses of Office: all which are so closed up with a wall that one can see no windowes, but what are ve∣ry high, those only excepted by which you
<PB N="153" REF="82"/> passe unto the Chappells, and second Hall. The Halls are for the Cardinalls to walke in, and recreate themselves in, when they are not imployed in the Election; the other roomes are for the use of such, as are also shutt up with the Cardinalls in the Conclave. The gate at the entrance into the first Hall hath a wicket in it, through which the Cardinalls dyet is brought in unto them; and the said gate and wicket are made safe with strong iron barrs, and foure locks. In the lesser Chappell the Fa∣thers meete to celebrate Divine Service, and to make the election. In the greater Chappell are so many Cells made, as there be Cardinalls voting in election; which are distant about a foot one from another, and are not separated asunder by any wall, or such like matter, but by curtaines or thin cloth, which hang upon rafters set up all along in a decent manner for that purpose. Now these Cells all are marked with the letters of the Alphabet, and on the day be∣fore the Cardinals enter into the conclave, and are severally assigned to each of them; not by order, but by lott: and then doe their servants in that interim make provi∣sion of curtaines, beds, and other furniture for them. The Conclave being thus pre∣pared,
<PB N="154" REF="83"/> especiall order is taken that none may goe, stand, or abide above, below, or on any of the sides of the Conclave, nor that any may see, speak, or any way send, or cast any thing unto them that are shut up in it, lest thereby any might be enabled to search into their Counsells by voice, signe, sound, or any other device. More∣over there are foure guards of the further Conclave appointed: the guard of the first gate of the Palace is committed to some great Prelate, or Nobleman, who with two or three hundred souldiers, is to guard the Palace and the Fathers night and day. The second guard is within the first gate, as one goes up unto the Conclave, and is under the charge of the Conservators, and <HI>Caporioni</HI> of the Citty of <HI>Rome.</HI> The third guard is a little higher at the second gate, and is intrusted to a select number of noble personages. The fourth and last guard is at the immediat entrance into the Conclave, and is in the hands of seven or eight of the worthiest Bishops of the Ro∣man Court. The guard of the first gate of the Palace is setled assoon as the Pope is dead, but so are not the others untill the Cardinalls enter into the Conclave. The gate and wicket at the entrance into the
<PB N="155" REF="83"/> first Hall is, as I have said before, made fast with four locks, one to the outside of the gate, and one on the outside of the wicket; also one on the inside of the gate, and one on the inside of the wicket: the two keys of the locks on the outside of the gate and wicket are kept by the guard of that place, the other two keys of the locks on the in∣side of the gate and wicket, are in the cu∣stody of the Masters of the Ceremonies, so that neither the Gate nor the wicket can be opened without the consent both of them that are within and without.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of what was without the Conclave.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst of all in all the passages there were good Guards placed by the Prince <HI>Sa∣velli,</HI> as keeper of the Conclave, and per∣petuall Marshall of the Holy Church; which Guards never stirred from thence night nor day, untill the creation of the new High Bishop. On Saint <HI>Peters Piatza</HI> were also foure Courts of Guard of <HI>Levaes</HI> Souldiers, sett there by the Lord <HI>Don Tad∣deo Barberino,</HI> as Generall of the Holy Church, by the appointment of the Sacred Colledge, during the vacancie of the Sea.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="87"/>
<P>Vpon the Staires of the Apostolicall Palace, that lookes to the <HI>Piatza,</HI> the <HI>Switzers</HI> of his Holinesse guard made a ba∣ricado of Tables, with two courts of Guard; and another within the Court yard of the first Gate: and on the staires, whereby one descends unto Saint <HI>Peters</HI> were two others likewise.</P>
<P>The Conclave was walled up by the Masons, and all the doores, every little crany, together with the great, and lesser windowes of the Lodgings were close made up; leaving only on the top an overturne of foure, or five hands bredth, covered with linnen cloath, where∣of part was nailed downe, and part of it was not.</P>
<P>There were on divers parts seven pas∣sages, whereby the Diet entred, comming in this order: first of all, came two of that Cardinalls Palfery-men, unto whom the Dyet went, with two long purple coloured Maces of wood in their hands, having their Masters Armes on them; next to them went the Mace-bearer with a silver Mace, and other Gentlemen; after whom came the Sewer with a Napkin on his shoulder, followed by two Palfrey-men, who carried cups, goblets, and silver chasingdishes;

As soone as all the dyet was entred, an Apparitor, assisting for that purpose, in a purple robe, with his Mace of silver, shut up the Passage; whereupon the assisting Prelate went to see whether the said passage was well shut, and then with a paper sealed up the lock; the like was done on the inside by the Masters of the Ceremonies.</P>

<P>IN the morning, after the shutting up of Conclave, the Deacon Cardinall cele∣brated the Masse of the Holy Ghost, and gave the Communion to all the other Car∣dinalls, making a briefe exhortation to the whole sacred Colledge for the election of
<PB N="164" REF="88"/> the new High Bishop. In the end after many scrutinies for the space of thirty and seven dayes concerning divers persons, and the vacancie of the Sea for a moneth and seventeene dayes, on Thursday the fifteenth of <HI>September</HI> 1644. the most emi∣nent Cardinall <HI>Pamphilio,</HI> having said his Masse in the <HI>Paolina</HI> Chappell, according as he used to doe every morning, entred with the other Cardinalls into the Chap∣pel of <HI>Sixtus Quartus,</HI> and seating himselfe in his place, the Masse <HI>pro Electione Romani Pontificis</HI> commenced, which was sung eve∣ry morning by the Lord Vestry-Keeper: After which began the Scrutiny for the most eminent Cardinall <HI>Pamphilio,</HI> where∣in he had fifteene votes, and then in the accesse thirty and three; the said scrutinie continuing for the space of sixe houres. Afterwards, the said Chappell being ope∣ned, the Lord Vestry-Keeper with the five Masters of the Ceremonies, and the Secre∣tary entred into it, and burnt the Sche∣dules. That done, the first Deacon Car∣dinall, the first Priest Cardinall <HI>Caporini,</HI> &amp; in the stead of the Prince Cardinall <HI>de Me∣dici,</HI> who was sick of the goute, the second Deacon Cardinall <HI>Barberino,</HI> went and made humble suite unto the most eminent

<PB N="166" REF="89"/> formost to the lodging of Benediction, where having caused so much of the wall of the window of that Lodging to be broken downe as they might well passe through it with the Crosse, the Cardinall shewed it to the people, who with great desire stood expecting it on the Piatza, in sign that by the grace of God there was an Election made of a new Roman high Bishop, and his Eminence with a loud voice declared it to the people with these ensuing words. <HI>Annuncio vobis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gaudium magnum, habemus Papam eminent ssimum, et reverendissimum, Dominum</HI> Johannem Bap∣tistam Pamphilium <HI>quisibi nomen imposuit</HI> Innocentium <HI>decimum.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon all the people that stood on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Piatza, fell out into great ac∣clamations of joy, and ran up and down the streets, striving a vye who should first give notice of it to their friends, and kin∣red; so that there was nothing but shout∣ing for joy every where, long live Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the tenth, long live the new high Bishop, long live the house of <HI>Pamphilio:</HI> and at the very same instant was the won∣ted sign given to the Castle Saint <HI>Angelo,</HI> which shot off all its great Ordinance, for a clear demonstration to the whole Citty
<PB N="167" REF="89"/> of the creation of the new Pope, upon the thundring whereof, there was not a Bell in all <HI>Rome,</HI> which was not rung for joy, being accompanyed with the sound of Drumes and Trumpets, and volleys of shot, aswell from the foot as the Horse, which stood quartered on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Piatza, and divers other places.

<HEAD>Ceremonies performed in going out of the Conclave.</HEAD>
<P>WHilst his Holinesse and the Cardi∣nalls were making a collation, and reposing themselves, the Conclave was by a great number of Masons every where unwalled and unclosed; after which, the Cardinals aforesaid went againe into the said Chappell, to make the second ado∣ration, and the Pope being seated before the Altar in his Pontificall robes, the Deacon Cardinall began first, as before, to do him reverence, &amp; then all the rest of the Cardinals, one by one, did the like: that ended, the Crosse, and the musick of the Chappell, singing divers Anthems,
<PB N="168" REF="90"/> and going before him; the Pope was car∣ried in a Pontificall Chair to Saint <HI>Peters,</HI> where being placed on the high Altar, he was the third time reverenced by all the Cardinals, in the manner as aforesaid, the musick of the Chappell singing in the mean time, <HI>te Deum laudamus; &amp;c.</HI> which once finished, together with the Cardi∣nalls adoration, the Deacon-Cardinal read in <HI>Cornu Epistolae</HI> certain verses, and prayers concerning the new high Bishop, who all the while sat upon the Altar, from whence descending, he turned himselfe to the people, and gave them his Benedicti∣on; and then going out of the Chappell with the said Cardinals, whom he saluted on every side of him as he went along, he put himselfe into a close Pontificall chair, and so was carried to his lodgings with a great train of attendants.</P>
<P>The same evening, and the two others following, the Castle of St. <HI>Angelo</HI> shot off all its great Cannon, and over all <HI>Rome</HI> were huge Bone-fires made, and stately lights set forth, in every window too of the Cardinalls, Princes, and Ambassadors, were great Torches of white waxe, which after they had burned a little, were thrown for joy amongst the people.</P>

<P>Thus ended the Ceremonies of the creation of the new Pope, and the peo∣ples externall rejoycing, because they hoped, that by the benignity, wisdome, and goodnesse of <HI>Innocent</HI> the tenth, they should see an innocent Golden age esta∣blished in the World.</P>

<HEAD>Of the manner of the Coronation of the said Pope <HI>Innocent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON Tuesday the fourth of October 1644. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the tenth, a Roman, sung a solemn Masse, and per∣formed other Ceremonies for his Corona∣tion in Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church of the Vati∣can, which was hung all about with most rich Arras, by Cardinall <HI>Barberino,</HI> who was Arch-priest thereof. Now the manner of this solemn Coronation we will endea∣vour to describe hereafter, as briefly, and with as much fidelity, as possibly we can.</P>
<P>On Tuesday aforesaid, then about se∣ven of the Clock in the morning, his Ho∣linesse passed from his lodgings to Pope Sixtus quartus his Chappel (which served for a room of preparation in that occasion) in his Chamber habit, being supported on
<PB N="170" REF="91"/> either side by the Lord Master of the Chamber, and the Cup-bearer, attired in red cloakes, with hoodes lined with red taffeta sarcenet, as all the other secret Chamberlaines of honour, and the Chap∣laines in like sort were, before whom in long red robes, but without hoodes, were the Chamberlaines, <HI>extra muros,</HI> and his Holinesse Squires: before the Pope also went the Emperors Embassador, <HI>Don Ca∣milo Panfilio,</HI> Generall of the Holy Church, the Ambassador of <HI>Bologna,</HI> and the Go∣vernor of <HI>Rome,</HI> then on either hand were the Captains of his Holinesse guards, both of Horse and Foote, after whom followed the Cardinalls in red habits, which com∣ing to Sixtus his Chappell, went in to the rest of the Cardinals who were there at∣tired in like sort. The Pope being in this manner arrived at the said Chappell, en∣tred with the aforesaid Master of the Chamber, Cup-bearer, <HI>Cesars</HI> Ambassador, <HI>Don Camillo,</HI> and the Governor of <HI>Rome,</HI> into a little room of the Vestry, where there was a long table covered over with a great table cloth adorned with gold pur∣ple, upon the which was set ready pre∣pared by his Wardrop-keeper, who stood thereby in a Chamberlains red habit, a
<PB N="171" REF="91"/> great gathered Vesture of Taffeta Sarce∣net, which by the Master of the Chamber, with the assistance of the Masters of the Ceremonies was girded about his Holi∣nesse, and then taking from him his Hatt, they put a red sattin nightcap on his head, in which manner he passed with the rest of the persons aforesaid into <HI>Sixtus</HI> his Chappell; where he no sooner appeared, but all the Cardinals standing up with their heads uncovered, made a most low obeisance unto him, and he returned them a very fatherly salutation; all the Cardi∣nalls followers, which were in a great number there, being all the while on their knees. The Pope then went and stood leaning against the Altar of the said Chap∣pell, whereupon the two Deacon Cardi∣nalls, <HI>Barberino</HI> and <HI>Ginetti,</HI> with their usu∣all obeisance came and took from him his red sattin nightcap, and instead thereof put on his head another of white taffeta sarcenet. In the mean time all the Cardi∣nals circled him round about, and were bidden by the chiefe Master of the Cere∣monies to put on their hats; then the said two Deacon-Cardinalls received from the hands of the Apostolicall Sub-Deacons the ensuing ornaments, which had been
<PB N="172" REF="92"/> taken out of his Holinesse Vestry, and laid ready by them on the said Altar, that is, an Amite, an Albe, or Surplice, a Girdle, a Stole, a red Rochet embroidered all o∣ver with gold twist, and a great Brouch of Gold, wherewith they attired his Ho∣linesse; after which, the chief Deacon having put upon his head a most pretious Myter, the Master of the Ceremonies cried out with a loud voice <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra,</HI> whereupon the Apostolicall Sub-Deacon took up the gestatory Crosse, which is usually carried before the Pope, at the passing by where∣of all the Cardinals put off their hatts; be∣fore the Crosse went the Popes Squires two and two in a processionall manner, after whom followed an infinit number of Courtiers, decently apparelled; then came the Chamberlaines <HI>extra muros,</HI> with a great company more of Courtiers, next to them went the Consistoriall Ad∣vocates, the Popes secret Chamberlaines of honour, the Referendary Prelates of the Chancery, the Bishops, Arch-Bishops, and Patriarchs; as also seven of his Holi∣nesse Chaplaines, each of which carried in his hand a most pretious Crown or My∣ter: then came the Crosse aforesaid, and the Deacons, Priests, and Bishops Cardi∣nals
<PB N="173" REF="92"/> having at parting made a most low obeisance to the Pope, who stood all the while leaning against the Altar as afore∣said) marched two and two with their train of followers before them; next went the three Conservators of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Priors of the <HI>Caporioni</HI> in their long gowns of black Velvet, the Ambassador, the Prince, and the other persons aforesaid: After all this, the Pope was by the two Deacon Cardinals, and his Master of the Chamber, conducted from the Altar to his gestatory Chair, wherein being seated by the Masters of the Ceremonies, they made a sign unto his Holinesse Palfrey men, who were attired in long Rose-co∣loured garments that reached to the ground, to advance the said Chair: On either side of the procession were the guard of Switzers with naked swords on their shoulders, and halberds, who with the launcespezzadoes made way through the great throng of people, which were in an infinite number dispersed over all the places thereabout.</P>
<P>And thus was his Holinesse carried to Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church in the said gestatory chair under a goodly rich Canopy, which was born up by the Knights of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<PB N="174" REF="93"/>
<P>Being arrived at the Porch of the said Church, where neere to the Holy Doore was a Throne erected under a cloth of State, with a raile about it to keepe off the presse of the people, and accommodated with seates for the Cardinalls to sit on, His Highnesse then, being placed on the said Throne, admitted the Chapter, and Clergy of <HI>Peters</HI> Church, to kisse his feet; which ceremony performed, hee entred with great Majesty through the chiefe Doore into the Church, whilst the people that were numberlesse, cryed out in the <HI>Piatza,</HI> in the Porch, and in the Church, <HI>Long live Innocent the tenth.</HI> And being come before the Holy Sacrament hee kneeled downe on a carpet there prepared for him, and prayed: then arising up hee went to Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> the great Chappell called the <HI>Clementine,</HI> where under a most rich cloth of State was a chaire placed, in the which being sett, with the Ambassador of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Don Camillo Panfilio</HI> on his right hand; and the Conservators of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Prior of the <HI>Caporioni</HI> on his left, all the Cardinals, and other Prelates came &amp; ren∣dred him obedience; the Cardinalls by kissing of his hand, and the Bishop by kis∣sing of his knee. After this his Holinesse ha∣ving
<PB N="175" REF="93"/> his Papall Crosse before him, gave a solemne benediction to the people, who with their propitious acclamations made that great Church to resound againe.</P>
<P>This Ceremony ended, the Cardinals, Bishops, Prelates, and others, fell to put∣ting on their Holy white Ornaments, whilst his Holinesse was reading the pray∣ers, and preparations for Masse.</P>
<P>When his Holinesse had done reading, and the musick the <HI>Benedicamus Domino,</HI> he washed his hands, the chiefe Conser∣vators holding the water unto him the first time, and at Masse, <HI>Don Camilo,</HI> Ge∣nerall of the Holy Church, his Nephew, the second time, the Ambassador of <HI>France</HI> the third time, and the Emperors Am∣bassador the fourth time.</P>
<P>After this there was brought in by the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Acolythite is a Clerk inferior to a Sub-Deacon.</NOTE> Apostolicall Acolythits other Ornaments for his Holinesse, covered over with very white fine linnen, which they delivered unto the Cardinall Deacon of the Gospell; whereupon the Pope putting off those he had on him, till then he was arayed with those that came in last, and had put upon his head a rich Miter, imbroidered with gold, and set all over with pearls and pre∣tious stones.</P>
<PB N="176" REF="94"/>
<P>That done the most eminent Prince Cardinall of <HI>Tuscany</HI> ordered the manner of the going of the procession, wherein his Holinesse Chaplaines carried the Crownes aforesaid, in the order above mentioned, but with different habits, having now such as were sacred on them, and before the Crosse went an Acolythite with a Censor and an Incense-pan in his hand: After the Procession went the Dean of the sacred Ruota, in the midst of his Holinesse Master of the Chamber, Cup-bearer, and secret Chamberlaines, which were followed by the Pronotaries, and other Prelates in their Coapes. In the space between Saint <HI>Gregories</HI> Chappell, and that of the Apostles, the Ceremony of the <HI>Blaze</HI> was performed thrice, with some distance of time between, by one of the Popes Masters of the Ceremonies, who holding a bundle of Flax in one hand, and a burning light in the other, set the Flax on fire, and so making the blaze, said, <HI>Pater Sancte, sic transit gloria Mundi.</HI> When as his Holinesse was come neer to the Altar of the Apostles, he kneeled down on a Cushion prepared there for him, and prayed without his Myter, then rising up on his feet he made the confession for Masse in this order.</P>
<PB N="177" REF="94"/>
<P>On his right hand stood Cardinall <HI>Lanil</HI> the Dean, as the assistant Bishop; on his left was Cardinall <HI>Barberino,</HI> Deacon of the Gospell, and behind them the Dea∣cons Cardinals assisted: In the mean while the Gentlemen of the Chappell began to sing the introit of the Masse: The confessi∣on ended, his Holinesse having his Myter upon his head againe, went and sat downe in the gestatory chair, wherein he was brought thither; whereupon three Car∣dinalls, <HI>Lanti, Roina,</HI> and <HI>Cheva</HI> read each of them a prayer for the Pope, who being come out of the said Chaire and his Myter taken off, the Prince Cardinall of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and first Deacon, with the help of the se∣cond Deacon, put upon him the Pall, say∣ing thus, <HI>accipe Pallium sanctum plenitudi∣nem Pontificialis officii, ad honorem omnipo∣tentis Dei, et gloriosissime Virginis</HI> Mariae, <HI>ejus Matris, et Beatorum Apostolorum</HI> Petri <HI>et</HI> Pauli, <HI>et sanctae Romane Ecclesiae.</HI> Upon the doing hereof, the Cardinall aforesaid of the Gospell stuck in the three Labels of the said Pall three Pins, having each of them on their heads different Jewels, one in the labell in the breast, another on the right shoulder, and a third in the labell on the left shoulder. Then his Holinesse
<PB N="178" REF="95"/> with his Pall upon him, and without a Myter, went to the Altar, which he kissed, as also the Book of the Gospell; and put∣ting Incense into the Censer, he censed the Altar, and then gave the Censer unto Cardinall <HI>Antonio Barberino</HI> Deacon of the Gospell: that done, the Prince Cardinall of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> having the help of the other assisting Cardinall, put the Myter on his Holinesse head again; he was three times censed by the said Cardinall <HI>Antonio,</HI> and aswell the said Cardinall <HI>Antonio,</HI> as the other two Deacon Cardinals kissed the Pope on the left cheek, and on the breast.</P>
<P>After this, his Holinesse went and sat downe upon the Throne, where all the Cardinals and other Prelates, aswell Pa∣triarchs, Arch-Bishops, and Bishops; as Abbots, and Penitentiaries of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> came in their sacred vestures, and reve∣renced him: the Cardinals were admitted <HI>ad osculum pedis, manus, et oris;</HI> the other Prelates kissed his foot and knee, but the Abbots and Penitentiaries his foot only.</P>
<P>The obeysance being finished the Pope standing up on his feet reade the <HI>Introit,</HI> and the <HI>Kyrieleson,</HI> and after which the <HI>Gloria in Excelsis Deo,</HI> together with the prayer of the Masse <HI>de die Coronationis</HI> be∣ing
<PB N="179" REF="95"/> sung, he went and sate him downe a∣gaine in his seate.</P>
<P>Then the Prince Cardinall of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> with the Apostolicall Subdeacons, the Au∣ditors of the <HI>Ruota,</HI> the Consistoriall Ad∣vocates, and other Officers, divided into two rankes descended to Saint <HI>Peters</HI> con∣fession place, where with a loud voyce the Cardinall said; <HI>Exaudi Christe,</HI> and the rest answered, <HI>Domino nostro, Innocentio decimo, a Deo decreto Summo Pontifici, &amp; universali Pa∣poe vita:</HI> the which words, aswell the <HI>Ex∣audi Domine,</HI> as the <HI>Domino Nostro,</HI> &amp;c. were repeated three times. Afterwards in like manner the said Prince Cardinall of <HI>Tus∣cany,</HI> said three times also with a loud voice, <HI>Salvator Mundi,</HI> and was still an∣swered, <HI>Tu illum adjuva Sancta Maria, tu il∣lum adjuva.</HI> That done, the Latine Epistle was read by the Apostolicall Subdeacon, and the Greek by the Greek Subdeacon; as also the Gospell in Latine by Cardinall <HI>Antonio,</HI> and the Greek by the Greek Dea∣con. Many other ceremonies besides, that are usuall when the Pope sings Masse, were performed, which for brevities sake are o∣mitted.</P>

<PB N="182" REF="97"/> which was published in Latine by the most eminent Cardinall of <HI>Tuscan,</HI> and in <HI>Itali∣am</HI> by Cardinall <HI>Barberino.</HI> Then his Ho∣linesse once more gave his Benediction, and so returned to his lodgings, after he had been disabled of his Pontificall ornaments in <HI>Sixtus</HI> his Chappell, where he recei∣ved from Cardinall <HI>Cappone,</HI> in the name of the sacred Colledge, the auspicious wish of <HI>ad multos annos.</HI> After his Holinesse had blessed the people, a signe was given unto the Castle Saint <HI>Angelo,</HI> which there∣upon discharged all its great Ordinance, and so did likewise the <HI>Germans</HI> many vol∣leys of shot in Saint <HI>Peters Piatza.</HI></P>
<P>There was in this Church neere the A∣postles altar, on the right, and left hand, two great scaffolds erected, hung with rich crimson damaske imbroidered with gold, which were full of Ladies; amongst whom the excellent Lady <HI>Donna Olimpia Malda∣chini Panfilia,</HI> his Holiness sister in Law, the <HI>Marchiones Ginstiniana</HI> her daughter; <HI>Donna Anna Collona;</HI> the Dukes of Saint <HI>Gemini,</HI> the Princesse of <HI>Nerida,</HI> the Princesse of <HI>Sulmona,</HI> the Princess of <HI>Rossano,</HI> and a great number of other titular Ladies, which for brevities sake vve vvill not mention. It is impossible to describe the
<PB N="183" REF="97"/> infinite company of people, which stood ramping in the aire, some on the tops and eves of houses, others in inches, over win∣dows, and many such places; amongst o∣thers, there was a great frame in manner of a Castle upon foure wheeles, made to clean the Church, and almost as high as the roof thereof; on the which partly sit∣ing and partly hanging, and holding by it in very great danger, were above three hundred persons.</P>
<P>The same evening and the next, a world of bonfires were made over all the Citty, and an infinite company of lights set out in the windowes of most of the houses thereof, all which was accompanyed with the sound of Drums and Trumpets, and the thundring of great Ordnance, and volleys of musket shot.</P>
<P>Many other particularities there were, which not to exceed the bounds of a briefe relation are omitted, only it shall suffice to say, that for many and many yeares before, <HI>Rome</HI> was not seen so full of gladnesse and rejoycing, as it was at this present, for the happy exaltation of this their new Bishop.</P>

<P>UPon wednesday then the 23. of No∣vember 1644. about seven of the clock in the morning, all the waies being filled with an innumerable com∣pany of people, the Pope set forth from the Apostolicall Palace in this order.</P>
<P>After some Trumpets, and a vantguard of Horse, rode certain of the Cardinals servants by two and two, each of them carrying his Masters valise of Scarlet em∣broidered with Gold; next to them went so many of their Mace-bearers, with their silver Maces at their Saddle bow, having their Cardinals armes engraven upon them: then immediatly came the said Cardinalls traine of followers, together with those of Ambassadors, Princes, and Nobility of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> all of them in rich apparell, as such an occasion re∣quired, and mounted on gallant steeds.</P>

<HEAD>The Ceremonies performed in the Late∣ranense Church.</HEAD>
<P>IN this order the Pope went to the Church Porch of Saint <HI>Iohn de Lateran,</HI> where, being lighted out of his Litter, Cardinall <HI>Colonna,</HI> Arch-bishop of the said Church, gave his Holinesse the crosse to kisse, which hee did kneeling upon his knees: That done sitting dovvn in a seate prepared for him in the said Porch, the Canons, and Clergie came in order to kisse his feet. After that the Cardinall

<PB N="190" REF="102"/> at the upper end of it, prepared for him, where he gave unto every Cardinall one medal of Gold, and another of silver, and to them which had more Offices, he gave for every office one medall of gold; after he stood up, and taking out of the assistant Chamberlaines lap asmuch coine as he could hold in his hand, being neither silver nor gold, he threw it to the people, saying, gold and silver have I none, but such as I have I give unto you.

<HEAD>Of the sicknesse, death, and obse∣quies of the Pope.</HEAD>
<P>ALbeit the Roman high Bishop doth excell all mortall men in dignity and authority, and is able to bind and loose all things on earth, yet cannot he avoid the extreame necessity of Fate; for the disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant greater then his Lord God did not spare his only begotten sonne, but would have him dye, that he might deliver man from Eternall Death, to the end all may know, that none is exempted from cor∣porall death: The Pope is to think, that though he be the highest of all, yet he is mortall, and ought carefully to beare in mind that Ceremony of the blaze which is used amongst other solemnities of his Coronation: Holy Father, thus passeth away the glory of the world; all flesh is grasse, and the beauty thereof as the flower of the field. Wherefore he should accordingly be alwaies prepared, as a good Pastor and a diligent Steward, to render an account of his stewardship unto his Lord, desiring to be dissolved, and to be
<PB N="192" REF="103"/> with Christ, and carefully endeavour to performe with praise that last act, where∣with the elect are wont to be Crowned. Now if the Pope doth not know whilst he is sick the danger of his disease, the Phy∣sitians that are about him, assoon as they are in doubt of him, do exhort him pri∣vatly with prudent words to doe all that is behoofefull for the good of his soule, promising in the mean time not to be wan∣ting in any thing that may conduce to the recovering of his health; after which they acquaint the Popes Confessor with the state of hs body, who more plainly, yet secretly, and with much reverence and charitie, declares unto his Holinesse the perill he is in, admonishing him to sub∣mit himselfe unto the pleasure of the Al∣mighty; and considering what place he doth hold to direct other Princes by his words and example in the way of Salvati∣on. The Pope of his owne accord, which is best, or incited by the said admonitions, taking notice of the approach of his last day, first of all devoutly confesseth him∣selfe of all his sinnes to his ghostly Father, and desires a full absolution of them from him; then in a convenient time he com∣mands all his domesticall Prelates, and
<PB N="193" REF="103"/> the chiefe of his family to be convented before him, in whose presence, and of that of the Holy Sacrament of Christs body, he makes an open confession of his faith, which he affirmeth he hath ever constantly held, and therein will by Gods grace live and dye. Afterwards he prayeth them all to forgive him, if by chance he hath unjustly offended any one, bestows some spirituall graces on them, and de∣siring them to pray for his soule, he re∣quires of the Vestry-keeper, or of some o∣ther Prelates, that he may receive the Sa∣cred <HI>Viaticum;</HI> and that when it shall seem seasonable unto them, they will admini∣ster the other sacraments of the Church unto him. This done, whilst he is in good and perfect memory, he sends for the sa∣cred Senate of the Cardinals, before whom he againe makes confession of his faith, craves pardon if in his government he hath offended any of them, intreats them to pray for his soule, commends the Church of God to them, exhorts them to be diligent, and unanimous in the election of his successor, and to chuse such an one, as might feed the flock of Christ more a∣bundantly, then he could doe, naming, if he thinks good, one, or more, whom in
<PB N="194" REF="104"/> his judgment he holds to be most fit: He also opens unto them his debts, and what is owing to him; manifests likwise unto them his writings, monies, and Jewels, makes his Will, and appoints the place of his buriall: Furthermore he recommends unto them his family, and retainers, and conferring on them such spirituall graces, as they desire of him, he dismisseth them with his blessing. Hereupon the Cardinals perceiving the Pope to be drawing to his end, elect three of the Colledge, namely, one of every order, who together with the Chamberlain, take an inventory of all the goods that are in the Apostolicall Palace, and put them up in a safe place under good custody: they look over all that is in the Lord Vestry-keepers charge, continuing it still in his hands, because he is a perpetuall Officer: The Colledge of Cardinals do also take care that no tumult may arise in the Citty, if the Pope doth die there, prudently, and in time intro∣ducing the Ecclesiasticall Militia, which they dispose of in the most opportune pla∣ces of the citty: They likewise provide for the provinces of the Church, sending grave and wise men Commissaries unto them. The Pope being as it were at the
<PB N="195" REF="104"/> last gaspe, some of his domesticall Prelats, still offer him the Crosse to look upon and kisse, putting him in minde of Christs passion: The Vestry-keeper also Ministers the sacred unction unto him, and com∣mends his soule to God after the usuall manner; whilst the Penitentiaries stand round about him, reading the penitenti∣all Psalmes, and other devout prayers, as he is expiring: After then that he hath yeelded up his spirit unto his Creator, his Chamberlaines prepare hot water with odoriferous herbs, and having washed his Body clean therewith, they wash it all over againe with warme aromaticall white-Wine, fill up all the places thereof, whereat dead persons doe commonly purge, with Mirrhe and Aloes, stuffe his Nose and Eares with musk, and rub his whole body over with Balsamum. All this performed, the Penitentiaries put on him his ordinary Clothes, and over them such his sacred vestments as he was used to celebrate Masse with, and in that man∣ner lay him on a Bier covered with cloth of gold, having the Popes and the Churches armes hanging upon it: under his head they put a pillow of cloth of gold, and at his feet they put two other
<PB N="196" REF="105"/> such like, with two Pontificall Hatts up∣on them. The Corps is thus adorned in the Popes privie Chamber, where if his Holinesse dyed in the night, it is kept un∣till the next day by the penitentiaries, watching and singing all the while a∣bout it: Morning come, the Corps is carried by the Penitentiaries at a conve∣nient time to the great Chappell, the Subdeacon going before it with the Crosse; as also the Gentlemen of the Chappell, singing <HI>Subvenite,</HI> together with fifty or three-score burning torches, borne by the deceased Popes equires, and all the whole family following after. There the Peni∣tentiaries singing the Vespers, and Vigils, untill the comming of others of Religious Orders: At length the Colledge of the Clergy, and the convents of Friers repaire thither, and immediately falling to fing the Vigils they sprinckle the Corps with holy water, cense, and absolve it. That done, the deceased Pope is carried with many torches before him, and the whole following after him, to St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church, and placed in the midst of it, where he re∣maines two or three dayes, to the end the people may visit him, and kisse his hand: Then is he returned back to the great
<PB N="197" REF="105"/> Chappell, and in the night interred there: In the meane time preparation is made for his obsequies; an hearse is erected in the said Church, which is hung all about with the Popes Armes, as well as the said hearse, and on every side of it are formes placed for waxe lights to be set upon them, as al∣so round about the Church are great waxe lights distant from one another the space of a speares length; and on every of the said formes are a dozeon waxe lights more. All things being well disposed then, the Messengers of the Roman Court, doe on the evening of the appointed day of the Obsequies give intimation unto all the Cardinalls, Prelates, Ambassadors, and Officers of the Court of Rome, that the next day the Obsequies of the late Pope of blessed memory doe begin; whereupon the morrow following at a convenient houre, the said Reverend Cardinalls doe all in mourning repaire unto the said Church, and sett themselves downe neere to the high Altar on seates prepared for them: the like doe the Prelates, Ambas∣sadours, and other Courtiers: and the de∣ceased Popes domestick servants doe like∣wise early that day march from the Apo∣stolick
<PB N="198" REF="106"/> Palace by two and two all in black, to the said Church, where they are placed round about the Hearse. Then is the Ce∣lebration of the deceased Popes Obsequies begun after the funerall manner of the Church of Rome: and on that first day are two hundred Masses said, and large almes distributed to men and women of severall Orders of Religion for the soule of the said Pope; as also a sermon made in the praise of him. On the ninth day like∣wise (for so long doe the Obsequies last) are as many Masses said as on the first, and every day about an hundred. The same ninth day, after the Masse of the dead, is also the Masse of the Holy Ghost sung, and an exhortatory sermon made for the ele∣ction of the new Pope.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the Pope the Col∣ledge of Cardinals doe signifie the same by their letters to Princes, and great Prelates, using the Apostolicall stile, calling the for∣mer sonnes, and the latter brethren, in the manner as the Pope doth.</P>
<P>This Vicechancellor also assooneas the Pope is, dead, takes away the Bulls, where∣with the Apostolicall Letters are sealed, from the Keepers of them; and that part
<PB N="199" REF="106"/> whereon the name of the Pope is inscri∣bed, he causeth publiquely, and before many persons to be razed, and made alto∣gether unfit for sealing: the other part, whereon the heads of the Apostles are in∣graven, he delivers tyed up in a linnen cloth, and sealed with his seale, to the Chamberlaine; taking speciall care that no Letters may be sealed after the death of the Pope.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Any ages are past (saith Saint</HI> Je∣rome, ad Laetam de instit. fil.) <HI>since of the old</HI> Rome <HI>there hath no longer been seen the beauty of the Forum, the excellencie of the Temple of</HI> Tarpei∣an Jove, <HI>the magnificence of the</HI> Thermae, <HI>or Baths built in the forme of provinces, the riches of the</HI> Pantheor; <HI>and of infinite other edifices, at the sight where of</HI> Ammianus Marcellinus <HI>stood amazed: and after the time of St.</HI> Jerome, <HI>the Citty of the Roman Gentles changed face in such sort, as</HI> Fuligines <HI>saith,</HI> et arenarum telis omnia Romae Templa cooperta sunt: mo∣vetur urbs sedibus suis. <HI>But now it is so strangely renued, that we cannot know what we read thereof in antient writters. It changed face I say in St.</HI> Jeromes <HI>age, at such time as</HI> mun∣danus populus ante delubra semiruta ad
<PB REF="109"/> Martyrum tumulos currebat. <HI>And after the cruell spectacle of the killing of the Citizens for the faith of Christ, it was purged from Idolatrous blood; and impietie and gentilisme being at one time extinguished, trophees were every where e∣rected to the preaching of the holy Apostles</HI> Pe∣ter <HI>and</HI> Paul. <HI>Finally the Empire of</HI> Rome <HI>was renovated with a strange Metamorphosis, and made, as</HI> Rupertus <HI>the Abbot saith</HI> lib. 3. cap. 2. de Divin offic. Caput mundi, Domini Christi Regis aeterni vehiculum, et habi∣taculum currus atque Thronum. <HI>Yet were not the antient Temples for all that taken away, but the superstitions were converted to Godly, and the wicked and impure to chast and religi∣ous uses; yea the very Baths and Theaters were all sanctified: But these too afterwards became the prey of the Barbarians, and of time; so that di∣spoiled of their pretious ornaments, and in part destroyed, they remained deformed reliques, al∣together unsufficient to excite in any the marvaile of the antient magnificence. At last the new City rose up again, with Palaces, Churches, Gardens, Pyramides, Columns, and other fabricks, no lesse to be regarded then the antient: There wants not in it an infinite number of Marbles, and other stones of great price; exquisite Mosaique works, excellent Pictures, and rare statues, and sepul∣chers:
<PB REF="109"/> In it also are noble Libraries, and Hospi∣tals for all infirmities, and nations; besides Col∣ledges and seminaries for youth, with large and spacious houses for the receiving and relieving of Orphans, and Children, both of the one and the other sex, that are abandoned and left to the wide world: It is likewise replenished with con∣vents of Fryars, Monasteries of Nunnes, and O∣ratories of laymen, who exercise themselves con∣tinually in the works of pietie, charitie, and de∣votion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Passing then oftentimes up and down this Cit∣ty, either for recreation, or devotion, and dili∣gently observing it on every part, illustrated with many famous antiquities, modern rarities, and superbe-edifices, which for their multitude can not without danger of the truth be trusted to the me∣mory of the spectator, I resolved to note all briefly with that order, which seemed to me most easie for the convenient viewing of them. Having done so then, and shewed it to my friends, they judged it to be very necessary for the travelling strangers, who roaming many times intricately thorough</HI> Rome, <HI>part from it afterwards confounded with the magnificence of a Chaos, and not satisfied in their desires: wherefore I thought fit to publish it for their better accommodation and benefit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now it may be some of them will complaine,
<PB REF="110"/> that I guide them with too Laconick a discourse for the understanding of that which is to be seen; but beleeve me if they would be informed of the be∣ginnings, augmentations, and qualitie, of all the Temples, Palaces, Gardens, Piatzaes, Statues, Pictures, Hospitals, Colledges, Fraternities, Mo∣nasteries, and other things of the Citty, many bookes would be required for the contenting of their Curiosity: But my intent only is to signifie so much briefly as will be sufficient for the speed of a strangers travell, who if he can have time e∣nough for it, he may arrive to the full knowledge of all the sacred and prophane antiquities of the Citty, with the study of certain Authors in print; of which that he may not be confounded with the multitude of them that have written thereof, I will quote some few that will very well serve to give him satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let the travelling stranger then furnish him∣selfe with</HI> Andrea Fulvio, de Palestrina, <HI>who wrote in latin, and was translated into Ita∣lian by</HI> Paolo del Rosso, <HI>in the year 1543. and newly printed by</HI> Franzini <HI>in</HI> Venice 1588. <HI>with figures, and the Annotations of</HI> Giralomo Fernucci.</P>
<P><HI>Next with</HI> Giovanni Bartolomeo Marti∣ano, <HI>but he must be sure to get that of the last Edition in folio, for the other printed in octavo
<PB REF="110"/> is not right, and reproved by the author himself.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All the editions of</HI> Fauno, Lucio Mauro, <HI>and</HI> Bernardo Gamucci <HI>are good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of all the Churches of</HI> Rome Ottavio Pan∣cirolo <HI>hath written, the Title of his book being</HI> Tesori Nescosti; <HI>and after him</HI> Pompilio Torto Stationer, <HI>under the name of</HI> Lodovi∣co <HI>his sonne, whose book is intituled,</HI> Ritratto di Roma moderna.</P>
<P><HI>Of all the pious works of</HI> Rome Camillo Fanucci <HI>hath written exceeding well.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of the Church-yards of</HI> Rome, Bosio <HI>hath treated, but he did not finish the work. It was printed with the revisall of</HI> Giovanni Severa∣ni, <HI>and an edition of many figures; being intitu∣led</HI> Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sotterranea.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Statues,</HI> Ulysses Aldrovanda <HI>hath written, and</HI> Francesco Perrior <HI>hath designed and cut an hundred of the most famous Statues of</HI> Rome.</P>
<P><HI>Of the pictures which are in some Churches frontispices, and Palaces,</HI> Gasparo Celio, <HI>and</HI> Giovanni Baglione <HI>have written.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The feasts which are daily celebrated in Church∣es and other places of the Citty, he shall finde printed in a sheet of paper, which is yeerly publish∣ed, and intituled</HI> Diario Romano.</P>
<P><HI>Finally, though I am certain that I have not
<PB REF="111"/> set forth anything in this treatise, which I have not read in some good Author, or seen with mine owne eys, or received from persons worthy of Credit, or established in the most common opinion of the World; yet doe I not for all that professe to take from any one that is of more understanding, the liberty of holding that opinion which shall seem better unto him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus communicating unto thee Reader, either stranger or other, that which I have done for mine owne use, commend it if it may serve thy turn al∣so; but if no, leave it to that end whereunto I directed it, which was only to show me how to walk in the Citty with some rule and contentment.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The first daies walke. By ill Borgo Vaticano.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He street, which in regard of the multitudes of lodgings in it, is most known to strangers, called <HI>della tenta;</HI> as also those others <HI>dell' Orsa,</HI> and <HI>di Tor nona,</HI> seem to me to be most necessary for the beginning and end∣ing of every daies walk, which the travel∣ling stranger shall make to view the most curious things of Rome.</P>
<P>In going from home, then direct your way to <HI>Elius</HI> his bridge, built by the Empe∣ror <HI>Elius Adrianus,</HI> at this day called <HI>Ponte Sant' Angelo,</HI> and <HI>di Castello:</HI> at the entrance into it are two statues of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> and Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> very worthy of regard; the first being the handy work of <HI>Lorenzeto Fiorentino,</HI> and the second, the better of the two, of <HI>Paolo Romano.</HI> Adjoining to the said second <HI>Statua</HI> is a Court, appointed for the execution of justice, although for great and heinous offences it is done in the hithermost Piazza of the Bridge.</P>
<PB N="202" REF="113"/>
<P>On the left hand in the <HI>Tiber</HI> you shall see the relicks of the antient triumphall Bridg between two Mills, whereof there are many on that River, which they say was the invention of <HI>Bellissarius.</HI></P>
<P>In the forefront of the bridge you shall discerne <HI>il Castel Sant Angelo,</HI> whose tower of Massie building was made in imitation of <HI>Augustus</HI> his <HI>Mausoleum,</HI> which stood just over against it on the other bank. It served the said <HI>Elius Adrianus</HI> for a Sepul∣cher, <HI>Bellisarius,</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and the <HI>Goths,</HI> in severall times for a Fortresse: After∣wards it fell into the hands of <HI>Narsetas,</HI> sent by the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperor to the aid of the Romans, who fortified it anew; but the <HI>Goths</HI> dispoiled it of its statues and other ornaments; ever since the time of Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> it was called <HI>Castel Saint Angelo,</HI> from the apparition of an Angell on the top of it, for a sign of the end of the plague which was then very great in the City. In the year 985. it was named the Castle and Tower of <HI>Crescentius,</HI> from one <HI>Crescen∣tius</HI> a <HI>Nomentan,</HI> for that he had fortified it with new works; and though many have done the like, yet was it most notably for∣tified by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixth: and lastly it was exceedingly bettered with
<PB N="203" REF="113"/> new Bulwarks, Ramparts, and Ditches; and abundantly furnished with great Ord∣nance, and all sorts of arms and amuni∣tion, by the late Pope <HI>Vrban</HI> the eight.</P>
<P>Having past the Castle, you shall see on your right hand certain Arches united un∣to it, which were built by the said Pope <HI>Alexander,</HI> from the Pontificall Palace to the Castle, for the commoditie of the Popes: and the said <HI>Vrban</HI> the eight caused them to be covered with a roofe, restored them in many places, and separated them from the houses for the more securitie.</P>
<P>On the left hand betwixt the Hospitall <HI>di St. Spirito,</HI> and <HI>Borgo Vechio</HI> was the Gate <HI>Aurelia</HI> of the antient City, and according to some named the triumphall Gate.</P>
<P>Then go straight unto <HI>Borgo Nuova,</HI> which was first called the <HI>Alexandrine</HI> street, from Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixth, who levelled and paved it; where in the midst on the right hand, you shall see a fair Church of <HI>Santa Maria Traspontina,</HI> under the government of the Carmelite Fryers.</P>
<P>Over against that is the Tribunall, and prisoners of <HI>Borgo.</HI></P>

It is at this day in the possession of Cardinall <HI>Spinola,</HI> of the title of Saint <HI>Occi∣lia.</HI></P>
<P>A little further on the right hand you shall finde the Church of the Cardinals train bearers,, then the Palace of the late Cardinall <HI>Rusticucci,</HI> which gives the name to the hithermost Piazza: Beyond that on the same hand is the Oratory of Saint <HI>Ca∣terina,</HI> governed by a lay confraternity.</P>
<P>When you are entered into the Piazza observe the beauty of the fountain, set up there by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth, with a cup, or boul all of one piece, of a certain speck∣led stone, called a <HI>Granito.</HI> On the left hand stands the <HI>Obelisck,</HI> brought out of <HI>AEgypt,</HI> and erected to the Emperors <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> in <HI>Nero's Circque,</HI> the place where Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Vestry is now, from whence
<PB N="205" REF="114"/> <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> removed it, and erected it anew with foure Lyons of gilded mettall which seem to support it, consecrating it to the Holy Crosse: the bignesse of it below is fourteen yards, and forty two minims, the height of it two and forty yards and an halfe, the upper part of it is three yards big and foure minims.</P>
<P>In this Piazza are the Palaces of the Priorie of <HI>Malta,</HI> and of the Family of the <HI>Ciboes,</HI> as also the Colledge of the Peni∣tentiaries of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> which are religi∣ous men of the company of Jesus, and the Vatican Seminary.</P>

And in summe, consider the immensitie of the whole Church, in the scite whereof were in times past two anti∣ent Temples of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> two fals Gods of the Gentiles: Omit not going into the Vestry, and into the Grott, beau∣tified with many curiosities, and suptu∣ously adorned; use means to get up into the steeple, and there admire the beauty and vastnesse of the frontispice, vaulted roofe, and great Lanthorne of the Church, and enter if commodiously you can into the boule, which is on the top of it, with a companion, and your owne wonder.</P>

<P>There observe an Ancient Temple with chamfred Pillars, dedicated <HI>Santa Maria Egittiaca,</HI> &amp; was in times past the Temple of Chastity, or according to some, of Fortune.</P>
<P>A little beyond on the right hand is a round Temple with Chamfred pillars, now the Church of <HI>Sancto Stephano,</HI> long agoe painted, as <HI>Fulvio</HI> writes, by <HI>Pacuvius</HI> the Poet, Nephew to <HI>Ennius,</HI> and dedicated to <HI>Hercules,</HI> or as others will have it to <HI>Juno Matuta.</HI></P>

By this Temple were the <HI>Gemonie</HI> stairs, so called from the lamentation of the condemned to death, who were thrown down headlong from off those staires, some thinke that the said stairs were neer to the <HI>Campidoglio.</HI></P>
<P>In this place were the Arches of <HI>Horati∣us Cocles</HI> erected to him in memory of that generous act of his in maintaining the <HI>Su∣blician</HI> Bridge against the Tuscans, the marks whereof you will see at the right hand on the <HI>Tiber.</HI></P>
<P>In this place likewise was, as some be∣leeve, the antient Gate <HI>Trigemina,</HI> before the walls of the City were enlarged by <HI>Claudius, Frontino</HI> saying that <HI>Cacus</HI> dwelt at the salt pits, where the Gate <HI>Trigemina</HI> stood.</P>

<P>In the wall of the City you will see <HI>Cajus Testius</HI> his great Piramide, by the vulgar beleeved to be the sepulcher of <HI>Remus,</HI> and on the forepart of it is this inscription.</P>

<P>Thereby is the most ancient Church of St. <HI>Balbina,</HI> adjoyning unto the which was in old time the Temple of <HI>Silvanus.</HI></P>

<P>Following along by the said hill you will see the Church of <HI>Santa Sabina,</HI> built, as some will have it, in the very place where the said Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> stood, within the convent lived St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> the founder of the Order of the Dominican Fryers; and to it doth the Pope with the Colledge of Cardinalls ride in pompe on the first day
<PB N="225" REF="124"/> of Lent. Adjoining thereunto was the Temple of <HI>Juno Regina.</HI></P>

<P>The Piazza is called so from an antient <HI>statua,</HI> reputed excellent, although through the injurie of time it is reduced to one only as it were deformed trunck; the name thereof is thought to be feigned, and to us is the similitude of it unknown; It serves the officers of the Popes Court,

<P>Between this Cirque and <HI>Monte Palatino,</HI> you will see the ruins of an Emperiall Palace, and where you are turning to Saint <HI>Gregorio,</HI> was the ancient gate of <HI>Romulus,</HI> called <HI>Romanula.</HI></P>

<P>You will in like manner see the Hospitall of men and women <HI>dell salvatore;</HI> and then go and reverence the Church of Saint <HI>Ste∣fano
<PB N="230" REF="127"/> Rotondo,</HI> which some think was the Temple of <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperor: of it, <HI>Matteo Silvagio,</HI> who wrote in the time of <HI>Paul</HI> the third, saith, <HI>Quam tecto nunc caren∣tem marmoreis columnis, et crustatis varii co∣loris, marmore, parietibus Mosaicoque opere inter primas Urbis Ecclesias ornatissimam fuisse judicamus:</HI> You will see in this street the conveyance of the <HI>Appian</HI> water.</P>

<P>Passe on along by the defaced Church of Saint <HI>Tomasso,</HI> to the house and now the Church of <HI>Santi Giovanni</HI> and <HI>Paolo,</HI> wherein they were secretly beheaded, and buried by the commandement of the Em∣peror
<PB N="231" REF="127"/> <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate: There too was the Palace and Court of <HI>Tullius Hostilius,</HI> the third King of the Romans; as also the dwelling of some Popes.</P>
<P>Descend from this place to the Piazza made by Cardinall <HI>Antonio Maria Salviati,</HI> where you will see the Church of Saint <HI>Gregorio,</HI> by him built in the place where his owne house stood, and dedicated to Saint <HI>Andrea.</HI></P>
<P>Then go up to <HI>Monte Palatino</HI> through a street which stands in the face of the Piazza, and every where you will discern the ruins of the Imperiall Palace called <HI>Maggiore.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the top of the Hill on the left hand is another Garden of the <HI>Mattei,</HI> and on the right hand you will meet with the <HI>Hippodrome,</HI> or Emperors Quierie or stable, where saint <HI>Sebastian</HI> was shot to death, neer to the which is the Church dedicated to the said saint, lately restored from the very foundation, and richly endowed by Prince <HI>Taddeo Barberino,</HI> Prefect of <HI>Rome,</HI> who had the patronage of it. Under this Church is salt Peter digged, and against it are the famous <HI>Farnesian</HI> Gardens, at the gate whereof towards <HI>Campo Vaccino,</HI> was <HI>Cesars</HI> house scituated.</P>
<PB N="232" REF="128"/>
<P>Being come out of the Garden, you will see the Church of <HI>santa Maria Liberatrice,</HI> in the place where the Temple of <HI>Vesta</HI> stood, as <HI>Andrea Fulvia</HI> writes, which place is famous, either for the Lake, whereinto on that part <HI>Metius Curtius</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Sabines</HI> fell; or for the gulph, into which the Roman <HI>Curtius</HI> precipitated himselfe: It was afterwards closed up up∣on the occasion which Cardinall <HI>Baronius</HI> recounts, in the year 324. by saint <HI>Silvester</HI> the Pope, who built upon it this Church; before the which are three chamfred pil∣lars seen, with their Chapters, and Corniches, of admirable workmanship, and it is thought that they belonged to the <HI>Portico</HI> of <HI>Jupiter sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or.</HI></P>
<P>Following on your way by the side of this hill, you will finde the round Church of <HI>san.

<PB N="233" REF="128"/> by the Popes, with dedicating the antient Temple to <HI>san Teodoro,</HI> and introducing the use of carrying thither young Infants, oppressed with hidden infirmities, to the end they might be freed from them by the intercession of the said saint.</P>
<P>This Church had been reduced to ma∣nifest ruine, had not the piety of Cardi∣nall <HI>Barberino</HI> provided for it, by covering the roofe all over anew, restoring the walls, and the Mosaique worke of the Chancell.</P>
<P>Before this Church there was a wood, and a Fen, or moorish ground, occasioned by the waters falling downe from the neighbouring hills, and setling in this low place, which was by <HI>Tarquinius Superbus</HI> fil∣led up with earth, and the wood cut downe, so that being made dry and firme ground, it was by the conveyance of the <HI>Cloaca Massina</HI> converted into the Roman <HI>Forum</HI></P>
<P>From thence go to see the faire Church <HI>della Madona della Consolatione,</HI> which was built upon occasion of the miracles which an Image, painted by Master <HI>Antonazzo</HI> on the side of a wall next to the Capitoll, be∣gan to worke on the six and twentieth of June 1470. and was consecrated on the

<P>Not farre from that arch was the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Puteale, is a well or Pit.</NOTE> <HI>Puteal</HI> of <HI>Libonus,</HI> and the Antiquaries say it was called <HI>Puteale,</HI> from a well adjoining to the Pretors Tribunall built by <HI>Libonus.</HI></P>
<P>Here also is another Church dedicated to <HI>St. Cosino,</HI> and <HI>St. Damiano,</HI> which at first was wholy under ground, and in regard of the dampishnesse thereof altogether impracticable, but the late Pope <HI>Vrban</HI> the eight reduced it with a Massy pavement to a good condition, and adorned it with pictures, and other rich ornaments.

<P>Within a little of this is the Emperor <HI>Titus</HI> his Arch, which by the Ecclesiasticall writers was called <HI>Septem Lucernarum,</HI> from a Candlestick there seen curiously engraven: In the roof within is the image of <HI>Titus</HI> rarely cut: Not far from this in that part of mount Palatine which stood on the sacred way, was the Temple of <HI>Rome,</HI> whose roofe was covered with sheets of Brasse, that were carried to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Church, by Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the first.</P>
<P>Coming from under the said Arch, go and see on the right hand the first Arch that was erected to <HI>Constantine</HI> the Empe∣ror; there are in it Imagerie, and some <HI>sta∣tuaes,</HI> whereof the heads were carried by <HI>Lorenzo Medici</HI> to <HI>Florence.

<P>The first that made a grant of the stones of this edifice, was <HI>Theodoric</HI> King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> at the request of the Roman people, with these words. <HI>Saxa ergo, quae suggeritis de Amphithe atro longa vetustate collapsa, nec a∣liquid ornatu publico jam prodesse nisi solas tur∣pes ruinas ostendere, licentiam vobis eorum, in usus duntaxat publicos, damus, ut in murorum faciem surgat, quod non potest prodesse, si jacet.</HI> But <HI>Paul</HI> the second pulling downe that part which looked to Saint <HI>Giovanni,</HI> and to St. <HI>Paolo,</HI> imployed the marble thereof in building of St. <HI>Marks</HI> Palace, and after∣wards Cardinall <HI>Rafaele Riario</HI> built with the same stones the Palace of the Chance∣rie at <HI>St. Lorenzo in Damasco;</HI> and Cardinall <HI>Farnesse</HI> (who was <HI>Paul</HI> the third) built his Palace therewith in <HI>Campo di Fiore;</HI> all of them as stately edifices as any <HI>Rome</HI> hath.</P>
<P>At this <HI>Colisseo</HI> began the <HI>Labican</HI> way, which from the Church of <HI>St. Clemente,</HI> and
<PB N="241" REF="133"/> then from <HI>St. Pietro</HI> and <HI>St. Marcellino,</HI> went out of <HI>Porta Maggiore</HI> to <HI>Labico,</HI> a place not far distant from <HI>Rome,</HI> which is thought to be called at this day <HI>Valmontone.</HI></P>
<P>Keep on your course towards <HI>St. Giovan∣ni Laterano,</HI> which will lead you to the most antient Church of <HI>St. Clemente;</HI> from whence go up on the right hand to <HI>Monte Celio,</HI> and see the antient devout Church <HI>delli Santi quatro Coronati,</HI> which was de∣stroyed by the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and restored by Pope <HI>Paschall</HI> the second, as also adorned with a most rich Chancell by Cardinall <HI>Millino;</HI> on this point of the Mount is a Monasterie of Nunnes, and of young orphan girles.</P>
<P>Further forward, having past the <HI>Salvia∣ti</HI> Colledges Vineyard, you will see on the left hand the devout little Church of <HI>san∣ta Maria Imperatrice,</HI> called in the antient book of rites and <HI>Ceremonies, St. Gregorie in Martio,</HI> from the near adjoyning convey∣ance of the water, called <HI>Maria.</HI></P>
<P>Being parted from thence, ascend up through a little street to <HI>St. Clemente,</HI> for to go to the <HI>sette Sale,</HI> a place now shut up, and there take your way by the hill named <HI>delle Carine,</HI> to the Monasterie of the Nunnes <HI>della Purificatione,</HI> and to the Noble
<PB N="242" REF="134"/> Temple of <HI>san Pietro in Vincoli,</HI> surround∣ed with the relicks of the Emperor <HI>Titus</HI> his Baths, and Palace. In this Temple you will see saint <HI>Peters</HI> sacred Chains, together with a <HI>Moses,</HI> and other goodly statuaes, the works of <HI>Buonarota.</HI></P>
<P>Behind this same Temple in a Vineyard stands the reserve of the water of the Em∣peror <HI>Titus</HI> his Baths, called the <HI>sette Sale,</HI> worthy to be seen.</P>
<P>In the Piazza of the said Temple, you will see a modern and faire Church of <HI>san Francesco di Paolo,</HI> built by the Colledge of the <HI>Minimi</HI> Fryars; and a little lower a modern Monasterie of Nunnes.</P>
<P>Afterwards descending, enter into <HI>Vico Scelerato,</HI> so called from the wickednesse committed by <HI>Tullia</HI> in riding in her Coach over the Body of her Father; and go to a little Church of <HI>Santa Andrea,</HI> seated in the place, named <HI>Busta Galica,</HI> from the bones of the Frenchmen there heaped up together, as <HI>Varro</HI> writes, and of the vulgar called <HI>in Portogallo,</HI> where see the most de∣lectable Garden of Cardinall <HI>Pio,</HI> formerly belonging to Cardinall <HI>Lanfranco.</HI></P>
<P>In this place the Antiquaries seat the <HI>Tigello Sororio,</HI> which was a long pole, or rafter, laid acrosse the street, for the purg∣ing
<PB N="243" REF="134"/> of the parricide committd by that <HI>Ho∣ratius,</HI> who after the slaughter of the <HI>Curia∣tii,</HI> returning Conqueror killed his sister there.</P>
<P>Here also between the <HI>Colisseo</HI> and <HI>Tra∣janus</HI> adjoyning <HI>Forum,</HI> doe the Antiqua∣ries place an Arch, called <HI>Aurea.</HI></P>
<P>Proceeding on you will see <HI>la Torre de Conti,</HI> built by <HI>Innocent</HI> the third, and was not many years since more then halfe pul∣led downe, because it threatned ruine; and direct your way to an antient wall made like the point of a Diamond, which was the Confine of <HI>Nervaes Forum:</HI> passe from the same to an arch, where on the left hand are three chamfred pillars, upon which riseth up the steeple of the next Church of <HI>St. Basilio,</HI> and it is said they are remaines of the Emperor <HI>Nerva's</HI> Temple, although others have written that the said Church was built by Pope <HI>Symmachus</HI> up∣on the ruins of <HI>Trajanus Forum.</HI> These parts were all Gardens, and by Pope <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> the fourteenth made streets, which were replenished with edifices in lesse then two years space.</P>
<P>Passe on to the Monasterie of the Nunnes of <HI>St. Vrbano in Campo Carleo;</HI> then to <HI>St. Maria in Campo Carleo,</HI> and to the

<P>You may terminate this daies walke at <HI>St. Marco</HI> the Pope, where his body is con∣served, and at his Palace, whereof <HI>Platina</HI> writes in the life of <HI>Paul</HI> the second: <HI>Aedi∣ficavit etiam splendide, ac magnifice apud St. Marcum.</HI> Afterwards <HI>Silvagio</HI> writes of <HI>Paul</HI> the third: <HI>Ampliavit et auxit plateas ci∣cumcirca St. Marcum, id est circa Palatium e∣jusdem, quod Papale Palatium nuncupavit, pro oestivo tempore mutatorium, ob aeris salubritatem; Item Pontem a dicto Palatio usque ad Capitoli∣num montem a parte altera Monasterij S.

<P>See the Church of St. <HI>Eusobio,</HI> and the Quire thereof, made of Wal-nutt tree, ex∣cellently carved: There is some contro∣versie amongst Antiquaries, whether this was not the Emperor <HI>Gordians</HI> Baths.</P>

In this Mona∣sterie do the Nunnes of the order of <HI>Santa Chiara</HI> inhabit, and herein dyed St. <HI>Brigid,</HI> as some writers think.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of many, that in this place were the <HI>Olympiad</HI> Baths: Behind the which in that place towards the <HI>Quatrinal</HI> were also the Baths of <HI>Agrippina</HI> the Mo∣ther of <HI>Nero;</HI> and towards the <HI>Subburra</HI>

<P>Passe on to the Church of <HI>S. Marcello, nell Corso,</HI> which was sometimes the house of <HI>Santa Lucina,</HI> where St. <HI>Marcellus</HI> the Pope was put to death by the Tyrant: neer to this place is the Palace of Cardinal <HI>Cesi.</HI></P>

There also will you see that famous Temple, called by the antients, the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> and now Saint <HI>Maria Rotonda:</HI> It is held to be the fairest, and best piece of workmanship of all o∣thers whatsoever of that kind. The Foun∣der of it is thought to be <HI>Marcus Agrippa,</HI> and it was built in the fourteenth year af∣ter Christs Birth. Out of the observation made by skillfull Architects it is concei∣ved,
<PB N="255" REF="140"/> that the Portico was made at a diffe∣rent time from the Temple, in regard that the work is disjoyned the one from the o∣ther. It was stricken with lightning, and burnt in the year of Christ 113. and was restored by <HI>Lucius, Septimius, Severus,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius, Antonius,</HI> Emperors. The roof or vaulting thereof, by reason of age, and an Earthquake, threatned ruine, but it was repaired, and covered in some pla∣ces with lead by <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth, and other succeeding Popes. Observe the mag∣nificence of the Portico, in the quality and greatnesse of the pillars, which mea∣sured with the Roman span are six spans, &amp; 29. minuti thick; the Gate of brass, restored by <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth, twenty spannes, and two minuti wide; the bredth of the whole Temple from one side to another, being an hundred, and ninety spannes; and so much is the height thereof, from the pave∣ment to the mouth of the overture above. It hath one onely light in the superior part thereof, which is thirty six spannes and an half wide; the thicknesse of the wall, which compasseth the Temple is thirty and one spanns.</P>
