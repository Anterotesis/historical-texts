<P>These Provinces were first Conquered by the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> afterwards by the <HI>French,</HI> and then divided into several Governments depending on the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> till the year 1305. reduced to one by <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> (of which house is the King of <HI>Spain</HI>) Then they passed to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> by <HI>Mary Henrietta</HI> Heiress of the House of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth (having gotten from <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> his Prisoner at <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> a renunciation of the Old right the <HI>French</HI> had to <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>) was sole Master of these Provinces; But in the year 1581. some of them openly revolted from <HI>Philip</HI> II. his Son,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having two years before made their <HI>Ʋnion</HI> at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> to secure themselves from the Cruelties and Barba∣rous usage of the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> their Governour.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the <HI>Catholick-Provinces</HI> or <HI>Flanders</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> or the nine <HI>Catholick Provinces,</HI> commonly called by the general name<NOTE PLACE="marg">Name.</NOTE> of <HI>Flanders,</HI> (the principal of these Provin∣ces,) including the two Fees of the Empire, <HI>viz.</HI> the Archbishoprick of <HI>Cambray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds.</NOTE> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege,</HI> are bounded on the North with the <HI>Ocean</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces;</HI> On the West or, North-West, with the <HI>Ocean:</HI> On the South and South-West with <HI>France:</HI> and on the East with <HI>Germany.</HI> Their Extent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent.</NOTE> South and North is about 140 miles, from <HI>Thionville</HI> in <HI>Luxemburg</HI> to <HI>Boisleduc</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> about 150 West and East, from <HI>Gravelins</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> to <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> on the confines of the Dukedom of <HI>Juliers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Flanders</HI> is generally one of the best and most plentiful Countries in the World;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quality.</NOTE> extremely Po∣pulous and full of excellent Towns and Villages; its Air is good; its Soil most Fertile; the People good na∣tured, hardy and laborious. This Countrey was once so very rich,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> that the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Reve∣nues from thence, when he had all, was greater than any Prince in Christendom, the King of <HI>France</HI> except∣ed; but at present the charge of keeping is much greater than the Revenues. The strength<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength.</NOTE> of these parts is ve∣ry great; but its best and strongest places are in the possession of the <HI>French;</HI> and for a long time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not been able to keep those they have still, without the help either of the <HI>English, Dutch</HI> or <HI>Branden∣burghers.</HI></P>
<P>The Traffick<NOTE PLACE="marg">Traffick.</NOTE> in <HI>Flanders</HI> has been always very great, but now nothing so much as formerly, by reason of the prodigious increase of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> in these late years. It chiefly consists of several sorts of Manufactures, as rich Tapestries, fine Camlets, Ser∣ges, coloured Says, Mock Velvets, great quantities of fine Linnen, Damasks, Cambricks, Taffaties, Points, Laces, and striped Stuffs for Beds, which are transported into many Countries; all sorts of Ribbons, Bastard Sattins, and many other things of this Nature, made at the Cities of <HI>Mons, Ghent, Brussels, Ypres, Lille, Bruges, Mechlin, Valenciennes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants.</NOTE> of these Provinces consist of Flemmings, Walloons, Spaniards, with some intermixture of French, Dutch, and English, especially at present. The Religion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> among them is various, according to their several Na∣tions. In those places which are in the Possession of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> that of the Roman Church is only pub∣lickly allowed, and the Protestants tolerated out of Policy by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> only. On the contrary in those places that belong to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> the Protestant is only publickly ex∣ercis'd, and the Popish suffered in private. The Archbishop∣ricks and Bishopricks are all Roman Catholick.</P>
<P>The Languages<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> most generally used in these Parts are the <HI>Walloon</HI> and <HI>Flemmish;</HI> The Wal∣loon
<PB N="5" REF="5"/> is a corrupt French, spoken in <HI>Artois, Hainault, Namur, Luxemburg, French-Flanders,</HI> part of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and the Bishop∣rick of <HI>Liege.</HI> The Flemmish or <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> is a Dialect of the German, spoken in the <HI>Marquisate, Mechlin,</HI> part of <HI>Brabant, Flanders,</HI> and part of the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege.</HI> The Spanish is also much in use among the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects, and the French among the better sort; The Ger∣man has been lately introduced there by the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> Governour of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>The Principal Rivers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> in these Parts are the <HI>Maes</HI> or <HI>Meuse,</HI> and the <HI>Scheld</HI> or <HI>Escaut.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Maes</HI> Lat. <HI>Mosa</HI> has its source in <HI>France</HI> near <HI>Mount de Vauge</HI> in the Bishoprick of <HI>Langres</HI> in <HI>Champagne,</HI> passes through <HI>Charlemont, Bouvines, Dinant, Namur,</HI> (where it re∣ceives the River <HI>Sambre) Liege, Maestricht, Venlo, Grave</HI> and <HI>Dort,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Wahal</HI> (a branch of the <HI>Rhine</HI>) near <HI>Hervoerden,</HI> where it takes the name of <HI>Merwe,</HI> and having form'd an Island called <HI>Ysselmonde</HI> near <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> runs into the <HI>Ocean.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>This Province was heretofore governed by Earls, which did Homage to the King of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> as did also <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> after that <HI>Flanders</HI> was fallen to him by marrying <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Lewis Malatin,</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> in 1369. passing afterwards into the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter and Heiress of <HI>Charle les hardy</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to <HI>Maxi∣milian</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany. Charles</HI> V. (as we have already hinted) when he took <HI>Francis</HI> I. Prisoner, in the Battel of <HI>Pavia</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> enfranchis'd it from that servitude. But af∣terwards in King <HI>Philip</HI> II's time, it was extreamly curtail'd and harrass'd, which made many of the inhabitants retire in∣to <HI>England,</HI> and this did not only depopulate it, but impove∣rish'd it considerably, by carrying away a great part of its Trade. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> revolting at the same time, added to its Calamities by a War of 40 years continuance, and the <HI>French</HI> have of late made great Devastations in it.</P>

<P>I. <HI>Ghent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GHent</HI> or <HI>Gaunt,</HI> in Latin, <HI>Gandae aut Ganda∣vum aut Gandavium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gand.</NOTE> is one of the largest Cities in Europe, being seven Miles in compass within the Walls. They give out, that it was founded by <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> in a very Commodious place for Trading, <HI>viz.</HI> on the Confluent of four considerable Rivers, (the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Lys,</HI> the <HI>Moer,</HI> and the <HI>Leye</HI>) which run through it, and di∣vide it into 26 Islands which are joined together with as ma∣ny great Bridges, and 72 little ones. It is well Walled and Trenched about, and the private Buildings for the most part fair and stately. There are a great many Water and Wind-Mills; Seven Churches, and 55 Monasteries or Hospitals. Several Market-places, of which that of <HI>Fryday</HI>'s has no equal in Europe. The Castle, which is the Princes Palace, con∣tains
<PB N="11" REF="8"/> as many Rooms as there are Days in the Year, there the Wooden Cradle of <HI>Charles</HI> V. is still to be seen. The Cathedral is a most Magnificent Building, and the Tow∣er <HI>Bell-fort</HI> is above 400 steps high. The Town-house is al∣so worth taking notice of. The Cittadel consists of four re∣gular Bastions, but it lies not so very convenient as many others in these parts. This City is the seat of the Parliament or Provincial Court of <HI>Flanders;</HI> yet one may appeal from it to that of <HI>Mechlin,</HI> which judges without further appeal. The Trade of this City consists chiefly in Cloths, Stuffs and Silks of which there are so great quantity made, that among the 50 Companies of Tradesmen, those relating to Commo∣dities of this Nature make one third. It stands about twelve Miles from the Sea; 27 miles South West of <HI>Antwerp;</HI> 30 North West of <HI>Brussels;</HI> 94 South of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> 154 North East of <HI>Paris,</HI> and 160 East of <HI>London;</HI> Long. 22 d. 58 m. Lat. 51. d. 6. m.</P>
<P>Fifty thousand Inhabitants of this City, under the Stan∣dard of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> have formerly been formidable to the neigh∣bouring States, and their Princes themselves, in the Reigns of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> VI. Kings of <HI>France.</HI> In 1539. they revolted from the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. and would have put themselves under the protection of <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> who not only refused their offer, but gave the Empe∣ror free passage thro' his Dominions into the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> The Emperor having reduced them to obedience, put to Death 30 of the principal Burgesses, and banish'd a great number; took from them their Artillery, Arms, and Privi∣ledges, and built a Cittadel to curb them for the future.</P>
<P>This City was invested by the <HI>French</HI> King's orders the first of <HI>March</HI> 1678. On the fourth the King in Person came be∣fore it. The besieged to no purpose cut their Dikes, and drowned part of the Country, for the King lodged his Forces, and pressed so vigorously the Siege, that on the 9th of the same month the Town and Cittadel were both carried. It was restored to the Spaniards about four Months after by the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Bruges.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bruges</HI> or <HI>Bruggen</HI> Lat. <HI>Bruga</HI> and <HI>Brugae,</HI> is scituated in a great Plain within eight or nine miles of the Sea, upon the Canal called <HI>Reye,</HI> which being divided into several Naviga∣ble
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> Torrents runs in divers places of the City, and afterwards these join in the same Canal which goes to the <HI>Sluce.</HI> But this last belonging to the Hollanders the Inhabitants of <HI>Bruges</HI> about 40 years ago made a new Canal which goes to <HI>Ostend,</HI> that is but about three Leagues from it, and the Tide mount∣ing above half way, it bears Ships of 400 Tuns to <HI>Bruges,</HI> which maintains a standing Trade there. Yet it flourished more in former days, before Merchants had bethought of retiring to <HI>Antwerp.</HI> Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV. erected <HI>Bruges</HI> into a Bishoprick suf∣fragant of <HI>Malines</HI> in 1559, and <HI>Peter Curtius</HI> was the first Pre∣late of it. This is one of the greatest and beautifullest Ci∣ties of <HI>Flanders,</HI> fortified with good Ditches, great Ramparts, and strong Walls. The publick Buildings are very sumptuous, the Streets large and strait, with several fine Places, and chiefly that of the Market, whereat six great Streets begin that lead in a strait line to the six principal Gates of the City. There are seven Parish Churches. The Cathedral is that of St. <HI>Do∣nat</HI> or <HI>Donatian.</HI> The Provost of this Collegial Church was born President in the Court called St. <HI>Donat</HI> and hereditary Chancellor of <HI>Flanders,</HI> but this dignity has been united to the Episcopal Title, and the Bishop enjoys the priviledge now. Besides St. <HI>Donat</HI> there are the Collegial Churches of St. <HI>Salvator</HI> and <HI>Our Lady</HI> the Abbies of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Audemburg,</HI> and about 60 Religious Houses. At the side of the Cathedral is the Bishops Palace, and over against it is a great Market-place, where the Town-house is, an ancient Building enriched with Figures, and divers curious pieces of Sculpture. The Castle also deserves to be seen. Justice is rendred here by six Magistrates, who all have a particular Jurisdiction, <HI>viz.</HI> The City, the Frank, the Provost-ship at present, the Bishoprick, the Court for Feodal Tenures, <HI>Zizleele</HI> and <HI>Mandasche.</HI> There is also the Water-house with an admirable Machin to convey Water into all the quarters of the City. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a great Trade here in Wooll, Silk, Cotton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are a great many Tradesmen who make Fustians, Tapestries, Cloths, and Stuffs, of Silk. They are divided into 68 Professions. This City had a share in the troubles of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> during the Civil Wars. The <HI>English</HI> loosing <HI>Calais</HI> in 1558 removed the Staple for Wooll to <HI>Bruges,</HI> and that for some time preserved it from decaying. <HI>Philip</HI> I. King of <HI>Spain</HI> was born here in 1478. <HI>Bruges</HI> stands 24 miles N. W. of <HI>Ghent</HI> 11. E. of <HI>Ostend.</HI> 34. N. E. of <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> 40 W. of <HI>Antwerp</HI> Long. 22 d. 24. m. Lat. 51. d. 17. m.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<P>III. <HI>Ostend.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ostend</HI> Lat. <HI>Ostenda</HI> is a Sea-port Town seated in a Marsh, at the Mouth of the River <HI>Guele,</HI> and among divers Channels; but is chiefly environ'd almost on all sides by two of the great∣est of them, into which Ships of the greatest bulk may enter with the Tyde: it is very well fortified, having a strong Rampart, a deep Ditch, and eight regular Bastions, its con∣trived so, that the Sea may be let in round the Town for a great space, which makes it much more strong and defensible than before, and as it were impregnable. The Spaniards pos∣sess no other Port in <HI>Flanders</HI> but this and <HI>Newport,</HI> and this being the most considerable, they are making the Haven large, and have made a great Work in order to the carrying of their Ships over into that Cut which goes from <HI>Ostend</HI> to <HI>Bruges,</HI> out of their Harbour by the means of a very great Lock or recep∣tacle of Water which communicates with both. The Town stands low, but the streets are streight, large and uniform; The Haven such, that it can never be block'd up. This Town was besieged from <HI>July</HI> 5. 1601. to <HI>September</HI> 22. 1604. by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being then in the hands of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and at last was surrender'd upon good Articles, after a Siege of three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours. Its stout defence against the Arch-duke <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> and Marquess <HI>Ambrosius Spinola</HI> may be well ascribed to the supplies from <HI>England,</HI> and conduct of Sir <HI>Francis Vere.</HI> The <HI>Spaniard</HI> lost 78124 men before this Place; Tho' when the Arch-duke invested it, they did not expect it should hold out a Fortnight, which made the Dutchess promise she would never shift her Smock until it were taken; the number of those that were kill'd, or died in the Town during the Siege amounts to 150000. <HI>Ostend</HI> stands about nine miles N. E. of <HI>Newport;</HI> 11 W. of <HI>Bruges,</HI> 20 S. W. of <HI>Sluys,</HI> and almost 35 W. of <HI>Ghent,</HI> Long. 22 d. 8 m. Lat. 51 d. 18. m.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Newport.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Newport</HI> is a strong Sea-port Town. The little River <HI>Yperle</HI> runs on one side of it, which tho' but a mean Channel, yet where it falls into the Sea makes a considerable long and se∣cure Haven, especially at high Tydes. This Town is of good strength, has broad and streight streets, but the Houses are generally low, and most part of Timber. The Inhabitants
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> support themselves chiefly by the Fishing-Trade. It stands nine miles S. W. of <HI>Ostend,</HI> 16 N. E. of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> 19 almost W. of <HI>Bruges,</HI> and 40 W. of <HI>Ghent,</HI> Long. 21 d. 55 m. Lat. 51 d. 14. m. Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Nassaw</HI> gave the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a great defeat near this place in 1600.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Oudenard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oudenard</HI> Lat. <HI>Aldenardum</HI> is divided by the <HI>Scheld</HI> in two parts, and secured by a Castle called <HI>Pamele,</HI> which is join∣ed to the Town by a Bridge over that River. This is a rich place and drives a great Trade by the Manufacture of Tapestry which flourisheth here. This Town was taken by the <HI>French</HI> in 1658. restored by the <HI>Pyraenean Treaty,</HI> and retaken by them again in 1667. besieged without success by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1674. but by the Peace at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> restored to them in 1679.

<HEAD>Chiefs Towns belonging to the Hollanders in <HI>Brabant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I. <HI>Boisleduc.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BOisleduc, Bolduc,</HI> or <HI>Bosleduc,</HI> Lat. <HI>Boscum-Ducis, Sylva-Ducis, Bolducum,</HI> and in Dutch, Hertogenbosch, the Ca∣pital of the <HI>Dutch-Brabant,</HI> with a Bishoprick Suffragant of <HI>Malines,</HI> is situated upon the River <HI>Domel,</HI> which there re∣ceives the <HI>Aade,</HI> and afterward the <HI>Diese,</HI> and discharges it self about two Leagues from thence into the <HI>Meuse,</HI> at the place where it formeth the Isle of <HI>Bommel. Boisleduc</HI> is built in a plain, where there was a Hunting Forrest belonging to the Dukes of <HI>Brabant.</HI> But Duke <HI>Henry</HI> going to oppose the in∣cursions
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> which those of <HI>Guelder-land</HI> made into his Country caused this Wood to be cut down in 1172. where the Foun∣dations of this City were laid, which Duke <HI>Jeffery</HI> finished in 1184. Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV. erected it into a Bishoprick in 1559. and <HI>Francis Sonnius</HI> was its first Prelate; The Bishops now are but Titular and make their residence at <HI>Goldorp</HI> since <HI>Boisleduc</HI> is fallen into the hands of the Hollanders. This City is natu∣rally strong as well by its situation as by its fortifications; It is environ'd with Rivers and Meadows covered with Water so that the Avenues to the Town are upon artificial Causeys, made turning and winding, and commanded by one or other of the six Forts, built at some distance without the Town. Its Ditches are filled with the Waters of the said Rivers, which enter into the City by divers Channels very commodious to the Inhabitants. They are almost all Soldiers, tho' they do not neglect Trade, which occasioneth this saying, <HI>That the In∣habitants</HI> of <HI>Boisleduc</HI> are <HI>Warlike Merchants.</HI> The City is large, fair, well built and very populous. The Cathedral Church of St. <HI>John</HI> is one of the most sumptuous of the <HI>Nether∣lands,</HI> with a very fine Clock. The Market-place is envi∣roned with fine Buildings where 10 of the greatest Streets do end. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> became at last Masters of it in 1629. by the Valour and Conduct of <HI>Frederick Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> This City stands 43 miles N. E. of <HI>Antwesp,</HI> and 50 almost S. of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> Long. 24 d. 30 m. Lat. 51 d. 42 m.</P>

Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> sold it again in 1350. to <HI>John Polon</HI> Lord of <HI>Lieck,</HI> who left an only Daughter <HI>Johanna,</HI> Married in 1404. to <HI>Engelbert</HI> of <HI>Nassau.

This City suffered very much during the War between the States and the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> took it from the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces July</HI> 18. 1581. <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> be∣came Master of it against in 1590. by a Boat loaden with Turf,
<PB N="26" REF="16"/> under which he hid 60 Souldiers, who rendered themselves Masters of the Castle, and he afterwards took the City by Ca∣pitulation. They tell a very remarkable thing of one of these Soldiers, that was hidden under the Turf, <HI>viz.</HI> That not being able to abstain from Coughing, he desired one of his Companions to kill him, for fear his Cough should disco∣ver the Enterprize. Ever since this surprize, it is the Cu∣stom here to search all laden Boats by stabbing them with a Spit. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> kept <HI>Breda</HI> until 1625. That the Mar∣quess of <HI>Spinola</HI> General of the Troops of <HI>Spain</HI> besieged it, <HI>Aug.</HI> 27. 1625. and took it the 5th of <HI>June,</HI> 1625. This Loss af∣flicted the <HI>Hollanders</HI> extreamly, but they retook it in 1637. and have kept it ever since. <HI>Breda</HI> is of a Triangular Figure, at each Angle there is a Gate Built with Brick, and the Cur∣tins are flanked with Thirteen Bastions, besides several Ca∣valeers all mounted with Cannon. <HI>Breda</HI> however is not ve∣ry well Built, yet there is a pretty fair Street in it, the Town-house and some other Places indifferent. It is in a Marshy Ground, and often overflown. Its Fields are plen∣tiful in Pastures, watered by the Rivers of <HI>Aade</HI> and <HI>Mereck,</HI> which being joined enter into the City, and form divers Channels. The Palace of the Castle was lately imbellish'd, and the Fortifications repaired, and new ones made, by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> now King <HI>William</HI> III. of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> (to whom the City and Barony belongs) so that now it is a large Regular City, and is both by Nature and Art thought impreg∣nable: Besides the Ramparts which are all supported by very strong Brick Arches, and raised above the Houses of the Place, there are a great many Outworks, surrounded with double broad Ditches full of Water. <HI>Breda</HI> is 27 Miles N. E. of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> 20 W. of <HI>Boisleduc,</HI> and 52 S. of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> Long. 23 d. 57 m. Lat. 51 d. 38 m.</P>

They have Fortified this Place well and regularly, with a Channel that goes to the Sea, defended by divers Forts: The Buildings of the Town are fair and handsom, and its three Market-places large and capa∣cious. Amongst the Edifices, the Church of St. <HI>Lambert,</HI> and the Marquesses Palace deserve Observation.

It is the Capital City of the Country of <HI>Cuickland,</HI> remarkable for its Fertility, and has been a long time in the Hands of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Only about the Year 1672. the Torrent of <HI>French</HI> Victory swept it away into the Power of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.

<P><HI>Antwerp,</HI> Lat. <HI>Antuerpia</HI> or <HI>Andoverpum,</HI> and <HI>Antwerpen</HI> by the Natives, is the Capital of the Marquisate of the Holy Empire, with a Bishop's See under the Archbishop of <HI>Ma∣lines.</HI> The derivation some give of its Name is Fabulous. This City was formerly one of the Richest and most Beauti∣ful of the whole World, seated in a spacious Plain upon the Right side of the <HI>Scheld,</HI> where the River divides the Dutchy of <HI>Brabant</HI> from the County of <HI>Flanders.</HI> It was en∣larged by <HI>John</HI> I. <HI>John</HI> III. and <HI>Charles</HI> V. It contains 212 Streets, and 22 publick <HI>Piazza</HI>'s. The Houses are all neat and fashionable, and many of them Magnificent. In a word, all the Structures, both Sacred and Prophane, admirable. Our Lady's Church, the Cathedral, is a piece of of incompa∣rable Workmanship: it's above 500 Foot long, 240 broad, and 340 high, contains 66 Chappels, embellish'd with Mar∣ble Pillars, all different in shape, and adorned with curious Pictures, as well as the Body of the Church. The Tower is
<PB N="36" REF="21"/> one of the highest and fairest of <HI>Europe,</HI> Built of white Stone, where are 33 large Bells: The Three Chief Doors are cas'd with Marble, and gilt with Gold. This fine Church was almost burnt to the Ground in the Year 1533. and af∣ter that pillag'd during the Civil Wars for Religion. It was erected into a Cathedral by <HI>Paul</HI> IV. in the Year 1559. There are Four other Parish Churches, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>George,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and St. <HI>Malburge,</HI> besides 25 Colleges, Nunneries and Religious Houses, amongst which the <HI>Jesuits</HI>-Church is very Magnificent; it's paved with Marble on the two lower sides one above another, which are supported by 56 Marble Columns: The Four Roofs are hung with 38 large Pictures of <HI>Rubens</HI> in Gold Frames, and the Wall pierced with 40 cross Windows lin'd with Marble. The chief Altar is all of Marble, Jasper, Porphyre, and Gold. The Jesuits Treasure is valued Two Millions. The Town-house consists of Four Apartments, and the Easterlings House, the Exchange, and the Galleries that surround it, deserve to be seen. The Cittadel, one of the strongest and most regular is of a Pentagon Figure. It encloses two little Hills that give a Prospect all over the Countrey. This Cittadel was built in 1567. by the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI> The City lyes 18 Leagues from the Sea, between <HI>Malines, Louvain, Brussels</HI> and <HI>Bruges.</HI> The Harbour is very lovely, and most conveni∣ent, there being no less than Eight Channels for Ships to come up by to the City, in the chiefest of which 100 may ride together. There are 74 Bridges upon these Canals, all which Conveniences brought a great Trade to the Town, but the Neighbourhood of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> has deprived it of the greatest part. This City suffered much in the Revolt of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who plundered it Three days together, burnt above 600 Houses, and Kill'd and Drowned 10000 of the Inhabitants. The Confederates re∣pair'd it, but it was after that retaken by the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> after a Years Siege, memorable for the many Ma∣chines and Devices us'd in it. <HI>Antwerp</HI> stands 24 Miles N. of <HI>Brussels.</HI> Long. 23 d. 36 m.

The situation is very plea∣sant, and because of the Tide, the Trade is very good. There is an Archbishoprick's See founded by <HI>Paul</HI> IV. in 1559. with the Title of Primate of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> Car∣dinal <HI>Granville</HI> was the first Archbishop. The Cathedral Church is Consecrated to St. <HI>Rombaut. Malines</HI> is the place of the great Royal Council, instituted by <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> in 1473. There is also the Parliament of the
<PB N="38" REF="22"/> Knights of the <HI>Fleece;</HI> and the Prince's Arsenal. Speaking of this Arsenal, I cannot but mention, that the Thunder ha∣ving set on Fire several Barrels of Powder in 1546. it broke out with such fury, that it overturned a Tower, and above 300 Houses, dryed up the Ditch about the Town, and cau∣sed extraordinary Damage. In the Suburb is St. <HI>Alexis</HI>'s Nunnery, where there are 15 or 1600 Nuns, who are allow∣ed to walk abroad, to pay and receive Visits, and to Marry when they please. The Lordship of <HI>Malines</HI> had its own Lords, until 1336. that it became a free Town. After that time it belonged to the House of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> till it entred into that of <HI>Austria</HI> in 1477. Its Inhabitants are free from all Taxes, for the good Service perform'd to <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Bold,</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Nuis</HI> upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Here have been Two Provincial Councils, the first in 1570. and the second in 1607. The chief Trade of this place con∣sists in Tanning, making of Linnen Cloth, Point and Lace, (which bear the Name of the City) and casting great Ar∣tillery and Guns. It stands 11 Miles N.

But it is of no small consideration for its strength, for it is encompassed with a strong Wall and a Trench, and the access to it, which is on the North side, is extreamly difficult, lying all along upon the edge of the Rock: From one side thereof to the other, the Gate of the Town, (over which are the Governours Lodgings) spreads it self, and quite locks up and commands the whole passage. Here was before a very strong Castle. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> took this City in 1632. but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> recovered it again.

<P><HI>Cambray,</HI> Lat. <HI>Cameracum,</HI> seated upon the <HI>Scheld,</HI> is great, fair, well Built, and one of the strongest Towns of <HI>Europe,</HI> with Two Cittadels in it. Some Authors write that <HI>Camber</HI> King of the <HI>Sicambrians</HI> was the Founder of it. <HI>Clau∣dion</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> Conquered it in 445. and afterwards it fell to <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Bald</HI> in 843. and 870. after the Death of
<PB N="64" REF="35"/> <HI>Lothaire</HI> II. and sometimes after, it became the Subject of War between the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> the Emperors of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Counts of <HI>Flanders. Baldwin</HI> I. Count of <HI>Flanders</HI> took it, and gave it to his Son <HI>Raoul.</HI> The Emperors de∣clared it a free Town, but for all that the <HI>French</HI> never quit∣ted their Claim to it. In 1542. <HI>Francis</HI> I. of <HI>France</HI> consen∣ted it should be <HI>Neuter;</HI> but the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. took it the Year after, and kept the Inhabitants in awe by a Cittadel Built at their own Expences. It changed Masters some time after, when the Duke of <HI>Alencon</HI> Brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> III. was made Count of <HI>Flanders</HI> in 1582. He was also Master of <HI>Cambray,</HI> and left it to <HI>John Montiu</HI> Sieur of <HI>Belagny,</HI> who soon after join'd himself to the League, and afterwards made Peace with <HI>Henry</HI> IV. who made him Prince of <HI>Cambray,</HI> and Mares∣chal of <HI>France</HI> in 1594. but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> surprised this Town, and forced him to deliver them the Cittadel, the 9th of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI> 1595. The Inhabitants acknowledged <HI>Philip</HI> II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> but the Archbishop made such Complaints, and shewed such Reasons, that the King was satisfied with being Master of the Cittadel, and Protector of the Country, and left all other Jurisdiction to that Prelate. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> Fortified this Town very well, and kept such a strong Garison in it, that it was look'd upon to be impregnable. Yet the King of <HI>France</HI> took it in 1677. The great Cittadel is upon a heighth which commands all the Town; the Ditch is wrought in a Rock. The Ramparts of the Town are also Environed with deep Ditches chiefly to the East, defended with many good Basti∣ons. It reaches to the River, and has another good Fort to defend it of that side, which lying low, may be soon drown∣ed by drawing the Sluces. The Chapter of this City is one of the most considerable of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> consisting of 48 Canons, and 95 Ecclesiasticks, which Officiate in our La∣dy's Church. It's affirmed, that <HI>Diogenes,</HI> a Grecian by Na∣tion, was the first Prelate of <HI>Cambray,</HI> sent into <HI>France</HI> by Pope <HI>Siricius</HI> about 408. Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV. made it an Arch∣bishoprick in 1559. upon the Request of King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> and the Bishopricks of <HI>Arras, Tournay,</HI> St. <HI>Omer</HI> and <HI>Namur,</HI> were given for Suffragants. The Archbishops take the Title of Dukes of <HI>Cambray,</HI> Counts of <HI>Cambresis,</HI> and Princes of the Empire. The Streets of this Town are wide and very neat, and the chiefest and richest end in a great Place, where the Town-house is Built, and has a very curious Clock.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Description of the River <HI>Rhine</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Rhine,</HI> Lat. <HI>Rhenus,</HI> has its Sources in the <HI>Alps</HI> in Mount <HI>Adula</HI> or St. <HI>Gothar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Source.</NOTE> in the Country of <HI>Grisons,</HI> or <HI>Rhaetia,</HI> two or three Leagues from the Fountain of the <HI>Rhone.</HI> It springs from two Fountains, the one called <HI>Veder Rhyn,</HI> or <HI>first Rhine,</HI> and the other <HI>Hindes Rhyn,</HI> or the se- <HI>second Rhine,</HI> which join both together.</P>
<P>This River begins to be Navigable, near <HI>Chur,</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Course.</NOTE> and entring into the great <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Constance,</HI> it passes to <HI>Schaf∣fouze,</HI> and <HI>Basil,</HI> from thence it runs into <HI>Alsatia,</HI> and in∣creasing by the Waters of many great Rivers, it Waters the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> The Archbishopricks and Electorates of <HI>Mayence</HI> or <HI>Mentz, Treves</HI> or <HI>Triers;</HI> and <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Ceulen;</HI> then the succession of <HI>Cleves</HI> and <HI>Juliers:</HI> And finally it en∣ters
<PB N="74" REF="40"/> the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> at the Fort <HI>Schenk,</HI> where it di∣vides into two Branches, whereof the one called <HI>Vahal</HI> runs through <HI>Nimeguen, Tiel</HI> and <HI>Bommel,</HI> and joining with the <HI>Meuse</HI> it looses its name. The other branch takes its course towards the North, almost as far as <HI>Arnheim,</HI> where it sepa∣rates into two parts, whereof the one called the <HI>Yssel</HI> passeth to <HI>Doesburg</HI> and <HI>Zutphen</HI> and discharges it self into the <HI>Zuy∣der-zee;</HI> The other Arm, which since the year 860 has form∣med a new Course by the over-flowing of the Sea, is called <HI>Lech;</HI> and runs not by <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> and <HI>Leyden</HI> as it did then, but to <HI>Wyck, Cullemburg,</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> and finally, dischargeth it self into the <HI>Merwe,</HI> and from thence into the <HI>Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>This River, fam'd by the Greek and Latin Wri∣ters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> is without doubt the greatest in <HI>Europe,</HI> next the <HI>Danube,</HI> and noted for the excellent Wine, which grows on its Banks called <HI>Rhenish-Wine.</HI> The Etymology of its name is variously discoursed of by Authors; some deriving it from the German word <HI>Reyn,</HI> which signi∣fies Flowing hitherward; or <HI>Rein,</HI> which signifies clearness and purity, because it was formerly made a Test of Conjugal Chastity; for as, <HI>Hoffman</HI> relates, the Ancient Inhabitants about the <HI>Rhine,</HI> did use to try the Legitimacy of Children, by throwing them into it, reckoning such as sunk to be <HI>Ba∣stards,</HI> but those who swam, were look'd upon as lawfully be∣got; Hence <HI>Claudian,</HI> <Q>Et quos Nascentes explorat gurgite <HI>Rhenus.</HI></Q> It was also called, <HI>Aurifer</HI> by some because of the Gold found mix'd with its Sand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rhine</HI> was the Ancient Boundary betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany. Constantine</HI> the Great, begun a Bridge over this River at <HI>Cologne,</HI> to strike terror into the <HI>French. Charlemaign</HI> built a wonderful one of Wood over it at <HI>Mentz</HI> of 500 paces long, which was burnt by a casual Fire about a year before his Death.</P>
<P>In the Description I design to make of the <HI>Course of the Rhine,</HI> I shall confine my self to that which is most remark∣able both in the Treaties of Peace, and in the present and for∣mer Wars between <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> That is from its en∣trance into <HI>Alsatia</HI> down to the Fort <HI>Schenk</HI> in the <HI>Low-Coun∣tries;</HI> which comprehends six different Territories, <HI>viz.</HI>

<PB N="78" REF="42"/> has a Timber Bridge of great length: This is a place of ve∣ry great strength and Wealth, and so ancient, that it is said to have been built <HI>Ann. M.</HI> 1955. The <HI>Arsenal</HI> and <HI>Town-house</HI> do well deserve the view of Strangers, and the Cathedral de∣dicated to the Blessed Virgin their Admiration, not only for the Magnificence and vastness of the Structure, and its Gates of Brass, but more particularly for its Steeple called Tower of <HI>Mynster,</HI> which is Pyramidal and of a <HI>Structure,</HI> that lies all open and pervious to the light, being the most esteemed for its Workmanship of any other steeple in Christendom. It is 574 Foot high, and has 700 steps; but that which is most of all admired is the Clock Work, which besides the Hours of the Day, represents the motions of the Planets. In the year 1440 or thereabouts the Art of Printing was first invented by one <HI>John Guttenburg</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> who removed about the same time to <HI>Mentz,</HI> and there mostly used and im∣proved this noble Art; so that a mighty contest has been ma∣naged between <HI>Harlem, Strasburg</HI> and <HI>Mentz,</HI> which of them shall have the honour of this Invention. In 1529. This City embraced the Protestant Religion, and the year following en∣tred a League with the Reformed Cantons for her Defence; since that time its Government was Republican, till <HI>September</HI> 1681. that the <HI>French</HI> King having before possess'd himself of all <HI>Alsatia,</HI> suddenly surprized this important Place in a time of Peace when no body suspected it: which may be ascribed to the Pride and Folly of the Town, and their over-great Love of Liberty, by refusing 500 men the Emperor offered them for their security. The old Fortifications of this Town were but a double Wall, and a <HI>Fausse-braye</HI> so that it was not capable of making a long resistance, but the French have forti∣fied it very strongly, There is a Cittadel built on that side that goeth to the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and towards the Bridge there is a Horn-Work that runs a great way. There are also two small Forts at the two chief Gates, which lead toward <HI>Alsatia,</HI> so that in case of a Revolt, they can cut off all Communication with the Country. There are also Forts in some Islands of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and some <HI>Redoubts;</HI> so that all round this place there is one of the greatest Fortifications in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Ca∣pitulations made with the <HI>French</HI> have not been hitherto well observed; yet there is not above 200 <HI>Romish</HI> Converts. This City is already sunk in its Trade; and will sink more when the Fortifications are finish'd. There is an University found∣ed by the Senate in 1538. <HI>Strasburg</HI> stands 55 miles N. of <HI>Basil</HI>

<PB N="92" REF="49"/> Eight Romanists. The Government of the City was all Lu∣theran, but the Cathedral was in the Hands of the Bishop, a Roman Catholick. There were several Convents of both Sexes, and a College of Jesuits. The <HI>Calvinists</HI> had also a Church here, but their number was not considerable. Tho' the Town subsisted chiefly by the Imperial Chamber, yet there was an endless Dispute between them and the Cham∣ber, concerning their Priviledges. For the Government of the Town pretended that the Judges of the Chamber, as they were private Men, and out of the Court of Judicature, were subject to them; and in the Year 1685. they put one of them in Prison; and on the other hand, the Judges said their Per∣sons were sacred. In the last War in 1672. between the <HI>French</HI> and the Emperor, this City enjoyed a Neutrality on the Account of this Chamber, but in the Year 1638. was taken and Garrison'd by the <HI>French,</HI> and in 1689. a War en∣suing for the Recovery of the Countries Ravish'd from the Empire by the <HI>French,</HI> they with the utmost Inhumanity burned and destroy'd this Ancient and Venerable City.

<P>THE Electorate of <HI>Cologne</HI> borders the Duke∣dom of <HI>Juliers</HI> on the North and West.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds.</NOTE> The Electorate of <HI>Triers</HI> on the South; and <HI>Hesse</HI> and part of <HI>Westphalia</HI> on the East. Its Extent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent.</NOTE> cannot easily be determined, because it is strange∣ly intermixed with other Provinces.</P>
<P>The Archbishop is great Chancellor of the Em∣pire in <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> but never exercises the Function of his Office; For Princes that hold any Principa∣lities of the Empire are its perpetual Vicars, in which qua∣lity they can do in all places in their Jurisdictions what the Emperor could do in common cases, and in higher points have recourse to the Imperial Court. Wherefore the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Metz,</HI> who is great Chancellor of <HI>Germany,</HI> is Keeper of the Archives, and the Titles that concern <HI>Italy.</HI> The Golden-Bull bears, that the Archbishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> has the Privilege of Crowning the King of the <HI>Romans:</HI> Never∣theless it seems this does not belong to him, but when the Ceremony is perform'd in his Diocess, or in the Suffragan Bi∣shopricks; for the Archbishop of <HI>Metz</HI> disputes it with him, when it is done elsewhere. This does not hinder but the Archbishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> goes before him of <HI>Mayence,</HI> within the districts of his Metropolitan, and Chancellorship of <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> where he puts himself at the Emperors Right, leaving the Elector of <HI>Mayence,</HI> who preceeds him in all other Places, the Left. The Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> has also by the Golden-Bull the second Suffrage in the Electoral College, with Privilege to Vote immediately after the Archbishop of <HI>Treves,</HI> and exercise Justice by his Officers in all Criminal Cases in the Town, tho' otherwise Free and immediately depending
<PB N="103" REF="54"/> on the Empire. But the Towns-People do not suffer him to make any long stay with them, nor come with a great Train, which has been the occasion of several Debates these many Ages, and is the Reason why that Prelate keeps his residence for the most part at <HI>Bonn.</HI> The great Chapter of <HI>Cologne</HI> is one of the noblest in Europe, It consists of 60 Canons, all Princes or Counts; for they receive no meaner Person; quite contrary to that of <HI>Treves</HI> and <HI>Mayence;</HI> where they receive neither Princes nor Counts, unless for some weighty reasons. The twenty four Elders of the sixty form a particular Chapter for the Election of the Archbishop, and have their active and passive Votes, having power to chuse any of the Colleagues, or be chosen themselves to the Vacant Dignity.

<P>I. <HI>Cologne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cologne,</HI> or <HI>Colon,</HI> or <HI>Ceulen,</HI> Lat. <HI>Colonia Ʋbiorum,</HI> and <HI>Co∣lonia Agripina,</HI> is seated upon the <HI>Rhine;</HI> It is an Imperial Free City, and one of the four Capital <HI>Hance Towns,</HI> with an University, and Archbishoprick, whereof the Prelate is Prince and Elector of the Empire. This Place is very an∣cient deriving its Origin from the <HI>Ʋbiens,</HI> who courted <HI>Ju∣lius Caesar</HI>'s Alliance, to resist the <HI>Suevi</HI> their Mortal Enemies. In <HI>Augustus</HI>'s Reign they put themselves under <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s Pro∣tection, and passing the Rhine they founded on the left Bank the Town of <HI>Cologne,</HI> which they then called the Colony of <HI>Agrippa.</HI> Some say the Place was built before they came, and that they only enlarged it, about twenty or twenty four years before our Saviours Birth; and afterwards <HI>Agrippina</HI> Grand-Daughter of this <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI>'s Mother, to shew her power when Married to the Emperor <HI>Claudius,</HI> made
<PB N="104" REF="55"/> the Circuit of the City far wider than it was before, and esta∣blished a Colony of Veterans in it, about 48 years after our <HI>Saviours</HI> Birth. When <HI>Vitellius</HI> and <HI>Vespasian</HI> disputed the Empire, <HI>Anno Chr.</HI> 69. This Town was besieged by <HI>Tutor</HI> and <HI>Sabinus,</HI> who had revolted against the <HI>Romans.</HI> She obeyed the pressing necessity, received their Garrison, which she afterwards massacred, when <HI>Cerealis</HI> had beaten the Rebels. King <HI>Merouee</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> beat the <HI>Romans</HI> hence in the Reign of <HI>Valentinian</HI> III. and soon after <HI>Attila</HI> ruin'd it. But being rebuilt by the <HI>Romans; Childeric</HI> Son to <HI>Merouee,</HI> took it from them a second time, and gave it to a Prince his Cousin, Fa∣ther to <HI>Sigebert,</HI> called the <HI>Lame King of</HI> Cologne, <HI>and</HI> Riba∣rols, who was killed in 599. by <HI>Cloderic</HI> his Son. It was then that <HI>Clovis</HI> the Great, who for this Murther put the Executioner to death, united the People of <HI>Cologne</HI> to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> under which it remained during the Reigns of the Kings of the first Race. Under those of the second it fell to the Princes of <HI>France,</HI> Kings of <HI>Germany.</HI> In 881. when <HI>Charles the Big</HI> went to have himself pro∣claim'd Emperor beyond the <HI>Alps, Godfrey</HI> and <HI>Sigefroy,</HI> Kings of the <HI>Normans,</HI> took and burnt <HI>Cologne</HI> with fifteen or twenty of the best Cities in <HI>Gallia Belgica.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Otho</HI> the Great, under whom it was repaired, subjected it to its Prelates about 950. but succeeding Emperors made it free. <HI>Frederick</HI> I. allowed it great Privileges, since which time it encreased mightily, especially in 1260. when it entred into the League of the <HI>Hance-Towns,</HI> and became Capital of the fourth of their Provinces. After this it was govern'd by Senators until the Senate was changed in 1513. by a rising of the Peo∣ple, who Massacred the Consuls, Treasurers and some other Magistrates, accused to have cheated the Publick. The Se∣nate now is much like that of old <HI>Rome.</HI> It governs and judges in civil matters; but for criminals it has only the pow∣er to seize and examine them, without the Authority of ac∣quitting or condemning them. For the Elector reserves this to himself as the highest degree of Sovereign Authority; and 'tis for this reason, that tho' the Town is free, yet it does him Homage and swears Allegiance, upon condition that he will preserve the Privileges it enjoys. As for the rest <HI>Cologne</HI> is called the <HI>Rome</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> for its greatness, its Senate and fine Buildings. For it is certainly one of the finest, strongest, and biggest of all <HI>Germany,</HI> environed with strong Walls, that have eighty three Towers, and a Triple
<PB N="105" REF="55"/> Ditch that surrounds it, in form of a Half-Moon. There are 365 Churches. The Metropolitan St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s would be one of the most magnificent in the whole World, if quite finished. Besides which it has ten Collegiate, nineteen Parish Churches; thirty seven Monasteries, several Hospitals and Chappels The University was re-established in 1388. Besides which there is a Jesuits College built after the <HI>Italian</HI> fashion, with a very fine Dome. There are five great squares or principal Places in this Town, where, besides its bigness the cleanness of the Streets, the magnificence of both its Private and Publick Structures, the sweet humour and ci∣vility of the Inhabitants, amongst whom there is a great number of Learned Men, contribute much to render it consi∣derable. It has been a Bishoprick in former times Suffra∣gan of <HI>Treves,</HI> but was erected into an Archbishoprick in 755. ten years after <HI>Mayence</HI> was made one in favour of <HI>Boniface.</HI> The first Archbishop was called <HI>Adolph.</HI> He had for Suffra∣gants, the Bishopricks of <HI>Munster, Liege, Osnabruck, Min∣den</HI> and <HI>Ʋtrecht;</HI> but the two last being become secular, there are but the three first that depend on it now. The Ancient∣est Assembly of the Clergy held at <HI>Cologne</HI> was that of 346. wherein <HI>Euphrates</HI> then Bishop of the Town was deposed for siding with the <HI>Arians,</HI> and <HI>Severinus</HI> put in his Place. <HI>Charlemaign</HI> ordered another there in the VIII. Century; and there were some others held in the IX, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In 1688. Prince <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was chosen Archbishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> in oppo∣sition to Cardinal <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> who being support∣ed by the King of <HI>France,</HI> entred this Electorate to maintain his pretended Right by force of Arms, and made himself Master of <HI>Bonn, Keiserswert,</HI> &amp;c. which were retaken in 1689. by the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> and restored to the right owner. This contest about the Election of the Archbishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> is the more remarkable, that it was the first sparkle that kindled the War, which has raged these 5 years through most part of Chri∣stendom. <HI>Cologne</HI> stands 25 Miles E. of <HI>Juliers,</HI> 68 almost N. of <HI>Triers,</HI> 70 S. of <HI>Munster</HI> and 74 N.

<P><HI>Bonn,</HI> is situate upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> 14 Miles almost South of <HI>Co∣logne,</HI> in a very fine Country, environed with Hills, and co∣vered with Vines and Wood. Several Authors think that it was built by the <HI>Trojans</HI> after the destruction of <HI>Troy.</HI> How∣ever, it is certainly the <HI>Ara Ʋbiorum</HI> of the Ancients, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> Its name was also found in some Medals of <HI>Augustus,</HI> related by <HI>Goltzius</HI> under the name of Colony, <HI>Col. Julia Bona.</HI> It is a regular Fortification, the Walls are faced with Brick, and the Ditch which is dry, is pretty broad; but the Counterscarp is none of the best. As for the Town it self, it is small and poor, yet remarkable as being the ordinary Residence of the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> who has there a very fine Castle, and curious Gardens in the Neigh∣bourhood. The Town-House is also very well built, with divers Paintings, and a Clock with a melodious Chime, after the fashion of the Country. There are still fine Churches to be seen, the principal of which is dedicated to the Holy Martyrs, <HI>Cassius, Florentius</HI> and <HI>Malusius.</HI> This Town suffer∣ed much in the first Wars of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and was fiercely attackt partly by the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and partly by the Troops of the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> who carried it at last by Fa∣mine, in 1588. In this City <HI>Frederick</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> chosen in opposition to <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was Crowned Emperor in 1314. It was in times past an Imperial City, but now it is under the Archbishop of <HI>Cologne.</HI> In 1673. the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> now King of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> having taken <HI>Naerden</HI> and secured <HI>Holland</HI> by a part of the Army, he marched with the rest into <HI>Germany,</HI> and joined part of the Confederate Troops to Besiege <HI>Bonn</HI> which had been put into the <HI>French</HI> Kings hands, by the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and the taking this Place forced the <HI>French</HI> to withdraw his Forces out of the united <HI>Netherlands.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> made themselves Masters of it again in the beginning of this late War, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having given Troops to Cardinal <HI>Furstemburg</HI> to maintain his pretend∣ed Right to the Electorate. It was besieged in Summer 1689. by the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> who after having almost ruined it with Bombs, took it by Capitulation. At the last Siege of this Town, they found a Vault in which there was an Iron Chest, that was full of Medals of Gold, to the value of 100000 Crowns the Metal was Ducat-Gold and the Impressions
<PB N="107" REF="56"/> made for <HI>Roman,</HI> but very ignorantly, as being not above four or 500 years old, some few of them that seem'd true, were of the latter <HI>Greek</HI> Emperors.</P>

This Town was first Mort∣gaged to <HI>Adolph</HI> Duke of <HI>Cleves,</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> IV. Emperor of <HI>Germany. Gerard</HI> Duke of <HI>Cleves,</HI> Brother of <HI>Adolph,</HI> sold it to the Archbishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> for 100000. <HI>Florins,</HI> about <HI>An.</HI> 1399. and in 1464. it was finally with <HI>Bielstem</HI> and <HI>Fre∣derberg,</HI> confirmed to him, in exchange for <HI>Soest</HI> and <HI>Santen,</HI> by <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Cleves.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> had possest themselves of it for Cardinal <HI>Furstemberg,</HI> but the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> retook it in 1689.

Near this City are many Mines, as Lead, Sulphure, Vitriol, Iron, Coal, and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> with which they make Brass, or multiply Copper in their Furnaces. This City is al∣so Famous for its hot Baths, which are very much frequented, and exceeding convenient; three of them are within the Walls, and very convenient, the principal is called the Empe∣rors Bath; it has Five Bathing Rooms, in one of which <HI>Char∣lemaign</HI> used to Bath and Swim. These Baths rise so hot, that they let them cool 12 Hours before they use them. There is also a Fountain of this hot Water, much resorted to, and drunk of in the Summer. A little from this City on the o∣ther side of a Hill, at a Village called <HI>Borsett,</HI> are many hot Springs on both sides of a little Rivulet, which compose 28 Baths, whose Springs are hotter than any of the City, and are cool'd 18 Hours before they be used. This City suffered much in the late Wars, being taken by the Protestants, and retaken by <HI>Spinola</HI> in 1614. Several Councils have been held in this City; which is also famous for a Treaty of Peace con∣cluded there betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1668.

<P><HI>Geneva</HI> or <HI>Geneve,</HI> Lat. <HI>Januba, Genabum, Geneva,</HI> or <HI>Ge∣neventium Civitas</HI> is an ancient City of the <HI>Allobroges,</HI> upon the Frontiers of <HI>Savoy,</HI> seated upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> at the ex∣tremity of the Lake <HI>Leman,</HI> (now called Lake of <HI>Geneva.</HI>) It is a neat, large, rich City, well fortified, and has an ad∣mirable situation; partly upon a Hill, partly in a Plain which has the Lake on the North. The <HI>Rhine</HI> issuing out of the Lake, incompasses the City to the West, and divides it from that delightful part call'd St. <HI>Gervais.</HI> At the end of the City the <HI>Rhine</HI> receives the River <HI>Arve,</HI> which is another Rampart of <HI>Geneva</HI> to the South, and besides the defence it
<PB N="131" REF="68"/> draws from those Rivers to the South and West, and from the Lake to the North, it has very good Fortifications. St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church is built upon a Hill, and was formerly the Ca∣thedral. There are in this City several Piazza's, a fair Town-House, with a Pair of Stairs of particular Workmanship, an Arsenal in good order, vast Walks, and beautiful Streets, es∣pecially along the Lake. The <HI>Rivieres</HI> or Bank-sides make three different Streets; for there is in the middle a Passage for Coaches and Horses, with Shops on both sides, having Porticco's before them, supported with Pillars, where you walk securely from the Weather. It is a City of great Trade, in a Soil abounding with Wine. It is very an∣cient and was very considerable in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as several<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Spon</HI>'s Antiquities of <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE> Inscriptions testifie. After several Revolutions and suffering much by the Incursions of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> she had Counts of her own, of which the most Ancient was <HI>Robert</HI> or <HI>Ratbert</HI> in the year 880. After that, this City preserved her Liberty for many years under the Imperial protection, till being de∣serted by the Emperors, engaged in Civil Dissentions, she had recourse to her own Bishops, then in great Authority, but they embroyling themselves with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> those Discords strangely afflicted her, being already twice consumed by Fire. So that she was forc'd to struggle with the succeeding Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> for her Liberty; which she did with various Fortune, being reduc'd to great extremities by <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> after a long Siege; And like to have been seized by <HI>Emanuel,</HI> which forc'd her to a strict Alliance with the <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Berne</HI> and <HI>Friburg,</HI> by whom she was deli∣vered from her Fears, and the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> brought to an easie composition, and Renunciation of their Pretensions. But nothing conduced so much to her Establishment as her embracing the <HI>Reformation,</HI> first Preached to her by <HI>William Farel</HI> her first Minister, to whom succeeded <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza</HI> who both died at <HI>Geneva;</HI> so that after she had renewed a perpetual League with the <HI>Cantons</HI> before-mentioned, by their support in 1535. the Council of <HI>Geneva</HI> abolished the Ro∣man Religion, and forced her Bishop <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>la Beaume</HI> to re∣move his See to <HI>Annecy.</HI> About 350 years ago this City was twice burnt in seven years time; and the change of Religion having heightened its Neighbours Rage against it, it suffered a very sharp Siege and miserable Famine in 1584. But yet prevailed so far by the help of the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Zurich,</HI> that
<PB N="132" REF="69"/> the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the Bishop were forced to renounce all their pretensions to it. Nor did it reap less glory from its defeating the Nocturnal <HI>Scalado</HI> of <HI>Charles Emanuel</HI> in 1602. In these late years the <HI>French</HI> King has several times threatned this City of a Siege, but has been kept from such a design by the fear of breaking with the <HI>Switzers.</HI> The Em∣peror <HI>Charles</HI> IV. instituted here an University in 1368. which is still very flourishing <HI>Geneva</HI> stands 75 Miles N.

The <HI>Danube,</HI> or <HI>Danaw,</HI> Lat. <HI>Danubius,</HI> the greatest River of <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> which rises in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> at the foot of a Mountain called <HI>Abnuba</HI> in the <HI>Black Forest</HI> in <HI>Suabia.</HI> It runs through <HI>Suabia, Bava∣ria, Austria,</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> and here washes <HI>Presburg, Komo∣ra, Gran, Buda, Belgrade, Semendria,</HI> and some other places of less note, and so goes into <HI>Walachia, Servia,</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> and disburthens it self into the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> by six or seven great Streams, with so much rapidity, that its Water continues fresh for 20 Leagues. From the Source to the Mouth are reckoned above 700 Leagues, and all the way a very fine Country. The upper part is called <HI>Danube,</HI> and the lower <HI>Ister;</HI> which latter name it is by most Authors said to take, at its Cataracts near <HI>Axiopolis,</HI> It receives 60 other Rivers, 30 of which are Navi∣gable. The chief are <HI>Inne, Iller, Leck, Ens, Morau, Vag, Drave, Save, Tibisc</HI> or <HI>Teiss;</HI> the four last are in <HI>Hungary.</HI> Tho' this River rise from a very small Fountain, yet there is none in <HI>Europe</HI> comparable to it, for length, breadth, and deepness; of its length we have heard; it is called broad by way of eminence above all other Rivers; for its depth, <HI>Jor∣nandes</HI> writes, that it is 200 Foot deep in many places. Then as to the quality of the River, it is for the most part coloured like Whey, and very wholesom both to Drink and Bathe in. It has many sorts of excellent Fishes, and some poysonous. It is very often frozen in the Winter. The number of its Mouths, which is seven in all, is controverted, because two of them are dead and marshy, but Five great Streams all a∣gree on, of which two only are Navigable. This River has had many Naval Fights upon it, between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians;</HI> at one time were 20 Galliots 80 small Pinnaces, and little less than 100 Ships of Burthen imployed upon it in
<PB N="168" REF="87"/> a Siege of <HI>Buda.</HI> At the Siege of <HI>Belgrade, Mahomet</HI> the Great brought 200 Ships and Gallies up the Stream; the <HI>Hun∣garians</HI> sent a like number from <HI>Buda,</HI> which after a sharp En∣counter, took many of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ships, and forc'd the rest on Shore, and burn'd them. In this present War also, great Fleets have been fitted out on both sides on the <HI>Danube,</HI> some of the Ships carrying 30 Guns.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Drave,</HI> or <HI>Drau,</HI> Lat. <HI>Dravus,</HI> has its Source in the <HI>Alps,</HI> runs through <HI>Carinthia, Stiria,</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> and here falls into the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Save,</HI> or <HI>Saw,</HI> Lat. <HI>Sava,</HI> has its rise in <HI>Germany,</HI> in the <HI>Ʋpper Carniola,</HI> near to <HI>Carinthia,</HI> and then running Eastward through both the <HI>Carniola</HI>'s, and separating <HI>Sclavo∣nia</HI> from <HI>Croatia, Bosnia</HI> and <HI>Servia,</HI> after a Course of 300 Miles falls into the <HI>Danube</HI> a little above <HI>Belgrade.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Teiss</HI> or <HI>Tibisk,</HI> of which 'tis commonly said that two parts are Water, and the third Fish.</P>
<P>The other Rivers here of less note are the <HI>Raab</HI> which forms an Island of the same Name. The <HI>Marisch,</HI> the <HI>Vag,</HI> the <HI>Gran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lakes.</NOTE> and the <HI>Sarvithze</HI> which comes out of the Lake <HI>Balaton,</HI> besides which there are also the Lakes of <HI>Newdsiler</HI> and <HI>Beczkerk.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> are more inclined to War, than to Arts or Trading,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners.</NOTE> they are Cruel, Proud, Revengeful, and so divided among themselves, that it is no wonder if they be exposed to the <HI>Barbarians.</HI> They speak several Languages, and chiefly <HI>Latin,</HI> which is familiar to them. They eat and drink with excess, and live very nasty in their Houses; yet the Gentlemen live nobly, and are great Lovers of Horses, Hunting and Feasting. They are only stately in their Gardens and Baths, and provided their Palaces be large, they care not how ill furnished they be. They hate the <HI>Germans,</HI> though the Nobles seem to stick to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> to save themselves from the Oppressions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who value a Peasant as much as a Gentleman.</P>
<P>The greatest strength of this Kingdom consists in light Horse called <HI>Hussars;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength.</NOTE> their Foot Souldi∣ers are called <HI>Heiduques.</HI></P>
<P>The Clergy, the Barons, the Nobles, and the Royal and Free Towns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment.</NOTE> make Four Bodies or States. The States are to meet once in three Years, according to the Laws of the Country; and they have Right to Elect the Palatine, who by the Laws
<PB N="169" REF="87"/> of the Land, is to be a <HI>Hungarian,</HI> and has the whole directi∣on of the War, and Judicature. Nevertheless <HI>Croatia,</HI> de∣pendent of <HI>Hungary,</HI> has a Viceroy who has as much Autho∣rity as the Palatine.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Hungary</HI> two Archbishopricks, <HI>viz. Strigonia</HI> and <HI>Colonitz;</HI> and 16 Bishopricks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbishop∣ricks. Bishopricks.</NOTE> five under the Archbishop of <HI>Strigonia,</HI> eight under that of <HI>Colonitz,</HI> and three Suffragan of <HI>Spalato</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> were Converted to Christia∣nity by <HI>Gisle,</HI> St. <HI>Henry</HI>'s Sister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> Married to their King <HI>Stephen,</HI> about the Year 1000. In the XVIth Century, the generality embraced the Protestant Re∣ligion, some the Lutheran; and only a few Noble Families kept to the Romish, but since the late Conquests of the Em∣peror of <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Romish</HI> has got the upper Hand, and the Protestants there have been cruelly persecuted. There is also a mixture of <HI>Jews, Mahometans, Anabaptists, Arrians,</HI> and <HI>Ʋ∣nitarians</HI> or <HI>Socinians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was the first <HI>Roman</HI> that attack'd <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> subdued it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> The <HI>Goths</HI> af∣terwards took it, and this Kingdom became a prey to the <HI>Huns</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> who were turned out of it by the <HI>Hongres,</HI> a People of <HI>Scythia,</HI> who lived mostly on Blood; those that speak of <HI>Hungary,</HI> reckon <HI>Balamer</HI> or <HI>Ba∣lamber</HI> amongst its Kings. They reckon also <HI>Aptar,</HI> and the two Brothers <HI>Bleda</HI> killed in 444, and <HI>Attila</HI> named the <HI>Plague of God,</HI> who died in 453. having left many Vestiges of his Expeditions in the other parts of the World, with his <HI>Huns</HI> (who were <HI>Scythians</HI> mixt with <HI>Turks, Tartars, Ava∣res</HI> and <HI>Alans</HI>) as <HI>Huningen, Hunaldstein,</HI> and many other places of <HI>Germany,</HI> beginning with the word <HI>Hun. Attila</HI>'s Children by their Divisions lost their Father's Conquests. A∣bout 744. the <HI>Huns</HI> made another Incursion into <HI>Pannonia,</HI> now <HI>Hungary,</HI> under one <HI>Alme,</HI> who had <HI>Arphad</HI> for Successor. These gave the Name to <HI>Hungary. Zultan</HI> descended from <HI>Arphad,</HI> is said to have been <HI>Toxis</HI>'s Father, who begot <HI>Geiza,</HI> Father to St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> Crowned in 1000. or 1020. by whom begins the Chronological Succession of the Kings of <HI>Hungary.</HI> Since that, they were peaceably govern'd by their own Kings, until <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great's Death, whose Daughter and Heiress Married <HI>Sigismund</HI> of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> but his Government being not liked, they called in <HI>Charles Duras</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="88"/> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and <HI>Stephen Vayvode</HI> of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> combi∣ned with <HI>Bajazet</HI> I. Emperor of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Thus <HI>Hungary</HI>'s Misfortunes began, and since 1394. it has almost all along been the Seat of War, and became a prey to the <HI>Turks</HI> chief∣ly under <HI>Amurath</HI> and <HI>Soliman.</HI> But in this present War the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> has retaken most of those places the <HI>Turks</HI> did possess in <HI>Hungary.</HI> This Elective Kingdom is al∣most made Hereditary, since the Death of <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Young</HI> killed at the Battel of <HI>Mohach</HI>'s in 1526. at which time the <HI>Turks</HI> rifled <HI>Buda,</HI> and burn'd the Library of <HI>Matthias. John de Zapol,</HI> Earl of <HI>Scepus,</HI> was saluted King by part of the <HI>Hun∣garians,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> by the other part, but the last carried it. Since that time the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> takes the Title of King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1687. <HI>Joseph</HI> the Emperor's Son, was Crown∣ed King of <HI>Hungary;</HI> and in case the House of <HI>Austria</HI> should fail, the Branch of <HI>Spain</HI> is to succeed to the Crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies of Coronati∣on in <HI>Hun∣gary.</HI></NOTE> The most remarkable things at the Co∣ronation, were that Ten <HI>Hungarian</HI> Lords went before him, each carrying a Standard represen∣ting the Ten Provinces which depend on that Crown. The Arch-Duke made an open Profes∣sion of the Christian Faith, then was covered with St. <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>'s Royal Cloak, and had the Crown put on his Head, he taking an Oath to preserve the Priviledges of the Kingdom. Mounting his Horse afterwards, he rode full Career to ano∣ther Theatre, where, taking his Cimiter in his Hand, he made four Crosses therewith, toward the four Corners of the World, to signifie that he would defend the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> against all its Enemies.</P>

<HEAD>Description of the Remarkable Places in <HI>Upper Hun∣gary.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I. <HI>Presburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PResburg,</HI> called by those of that Country <HI>Poson,</HI> Lat. <HI>Poso∣nium,</HI> or <HI>Pisonium</HI> and <HI>Flexum,</HI> is seated upon the left side of the <HI>Danube.</HI> It is the Capital of <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI> and gives its Name to a Province, which lyes between <HI>Moravia</HI> and <HI>Austria,</HI> and the <HI>Danube.</HI> This was the Place of Conventi∣on for the Estates, since the loss of <HI>Strigonium,</HI> the Metropo∣litan. This City is pleasant, the Castle stately, beautiful and well situate on the top of a Hill, and all built of white Stone. Herein is kept the so highly esteem'd Crown of <HI>Hungary,</HI> commonly said to have been brought by an Angel from Hea∣ven to St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> their King, and of a different Figure from other Crowns. The Garden of the Archbishop is very fine, the Walks, the <HI>Grotto</HI>'s, the Figure of <HI>Jeronymo,</HI> the La∣byrinth, Fish-Ponds and Fountains are Noble, and worth taking notice of. In the Dome or Cathedral Church lyeth the Body of St. <HI>Joannes Eleemosynarius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Jesuits have a part of the same Church, and a Noble Apothe∣caries Shop full of Rarities. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have also a Noble Church here. <HI>Presburg</HI> stands by the Borders of <HI>Austria,</HI> 34 Miles N. W. of <HI>Raab,</HI> 46 E. of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and 95 almost N. W. of <HI>Buda.</HI> Long. 38 d. 14 m. Lat. 48 d. 25 m.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Newhausel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Newhausel,</HI> Lat. <HI>Neofolium,</HI> called <HI>Owar</HI> by the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> stands upon the little River <HI>Neutra</HI> or <HI>Nitrach;</HI> it is little but strong, and Capital of a large Country. It is Built in a Moor∣ish Plain, which is hard at the bottom, so that it is passable
<PB N="174" REF="90"/> every where; Its Fortifications are in form of a Star, with six Rays, having at each point a high raised Bastion. The place is surrounded with a Ditch full of Water, of a Rod and a half deep, and eighteen in breadth. It has only two Gates, and before each of them there is a Half-moon, without any other Outworks but a covered Way. The Turks made them∣selves Masters of this Place in 1663. And on the ninth of <HI>Ju∣ly</HI> 1685. Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with the general Officers of his Army having reviewed it, resolved to attack it. On the 16th of <HI>August</HI> he defeated the <HI>Serasquier</HI> that marched to relieve it, took twenty pieces of Cannon, some Mortars with Bombs, and four Standards; three days after, the Town was carried by Assault after a Siege of 40 days and all the Garri∣son put to the Sword. There were 100 Brass Cannons found in it, with Plate and other Booty, to above the value of two Millions. This Town lies 36 Miles E. of <HI>Presburg</HI> 12 N. of <HI>Komora,</HI> and 64 N. W. of <HI>Buda,</HI> Long. 39 d. 10 m. Lat. 48 d. 23 m.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Tyrnaw.</HI></P>

Yet <HI>Notwithstand∣ing</HI> this precaution they were discovered, apprehended and condemned to be burn'd alive. When they were put to the Torture, they were ask'd what put them upon such a horri∣ble Cruelty. They answered, it was because they were taught by their Ancestors, that the Blood of a Christian was a powerful Remedy to stop the Blood in <HI>Circumcision;</HI> Second∣ly, because it was a Philtre which created Love in those that eat Meat steep'd in it, Thirdly, That it did stop the over∣flowing of the Months and the Hemorrhoids; Fourthly, That it was to observe their ancient Custom of offering the Blood of a Christian to God yearly, adding that the Inhabi∣tants of that City, were enjoyned to perform their Sacrifice

<P><HI>Agria,</HI> by the <HI>Germans</HI> called <HI>Eger,</HI> by the <HI>Hungarians, Eclaw,</HI> is seated upon a River of the same name, which about three Leagues farther falls into the <HI>Tibisc,</HI> with a Bishoprick Suffragan of <HI>Strigonia.</HI> This City is small, but so well forti∣fied that it is accounted one of the strongest Holds of <HI>Hungary.</HI> It was besieged by <HI>Soliman</HI> in 1552. without effect. This Siege is so memorable that 'twill not be amiss to relate some particulars of it. When <HI>Soliman</HI> came before this Place with 70000 Men, it was neither strong by Nature or Art, but the Courage of the Garrison supplied that defect. There were in it 2000 <HI>Hungarians</HI> and 60 of the chief Nobility, with all their Wives, Children and Moveables. They bound them∣selves by Oath to hold to the last extremity, and put all their Provisions into publick Magazines, when the <HI>Turks</HI> summon'd them, they shewed them a Coffin from the Battlements, sig∣nifying that they would rather dye than surrender. The Town was battered 40 days with 50 Pieces of Cannon, and the <HI>Turks</HI> making three Assaults in one Day, were repulsed with the loss of 8000 Men. The instances of the Courage of <HI>Women</HI> during this Siege, are almost incredible. The <HI>Turks</HI> being so terrified with such Prodigies of undauntedness in both Sexes raised the Siege, and the Garrison Sallying out, kill'd a great number of them, and took all their Baggage. In 1596. <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. made himself Master of this Place, after having defeated the Forces sent to relieve it; and the Infi∣dels,
<PB N="176" REF="91"/> contrary to the Capitulation, Murthered the Garrison. From that time <HI>Agria</HI> continued in the Hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> till it was retaken by the Imperialists in 1687. after a Block∣ade of three years; during which there died of Hunger and Diseases above 10000 <HI>Turks.</HI> When the Garrison was forced to Capitulate, The Governour fearing lest the Imperialists should retaliate, what had been done in 1596, would not surrender till the Emperor sign'd the Articles. Four thou∣sand Inhabitants went out with the Garrison, 300 staid and demanded Baptism, and abundance of Christian Slaves were released.

<P>I. <HI>Buda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BƲDA</HI> or <HI>Offen</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and for∣merly the ordinary residence of its Kings, because of its pleasant situation. <HI>Sigismund,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who was Crowned in 1387. and was afterwards Emperor, beautified it with several sumptuous Palaces, and caused the Castle to be built, where afterwards his Successors kept their Court. This City passed for one of the Beautifullest of the King∣dom, before the <HI>Turks</HI> had it; but whilst it was in their possession, they suffered the finest Buildings to fall to ruin. It is built on the right side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> upon a Mountain which makes its situation very advantagious. <HI>Pest</HI> is on the other side, a little below it, and there is commonly a Bridge of 60 Boats, which serves for a Communication from the one to the other. The lower City, called <HI>Wasserstadt,</HI> or Town of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which is like a suburb, reacheth from the Up∣per City to the <HI>Danube,</HI> on the same side. The Upper City takes up all the Declivity of the Mountain, and is Fortified with good Walls, which have Towers at certain distances af∣ter
<PB N="182" REF="94"/> the ancient manner. The Castle is at the extremity of the City Eastward, upon a Hill which commands the greatest part of it.

In 1529. <HI>Soliman</HI> made himself Master of it again, after the Garrison had stood eleven Assaults, and restored it to the <HI>Vayvode</HI> of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> who had lost it before. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> in 1540, and 1541. Attack d it again, when <HI>Soliman</HI> coming the third time to relieve it, raised the Siege and made himself master of the Place by Stratagem and Surprise, and so took it from the Queen, whom he came to assist. <HI>Matthias</HI> the Arch-Duke besieged it again in 1598. and after in 1601. but with no success. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sat down before it in 1684. from <HI>July</HI> 14. to <HI>November</HI> 1. but was forced to raise the Siege and leave it.

<HEAD>Relation of the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> from <HI>June 15. 1686.</HI> to <HI>September 2.</HI> in the same year.</HEAD>
<P>THE 15th of <HI>June</HI> the two Bodies of the Imperial Army advanced equally; Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with the Ca∣valry encamped at <HI>Dotkamp,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> at <HI>Mo∣hatz,</HI> opposite to one another, the <HI>Danube</HI> lying betwixt them. The same day the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Staremberg</HI> arrived at <HI>Moratz</HI> with the Infantry and part of the Baggage of the Army. The 16th Prince <HI>Charles</HI> went to incamp with the Horse at St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Staremberg</HI> with the Foot at <HI>Dostkam,</HI> and the
<PB N="183" REF="94"/> Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> at <HI>Wailan,</HI> so that the Infidels, from the Ramparts could see the Christians on both sides the <HI>Danube.</HI> The 18th all the Infantry having joined the Army, the whole Army marched, and invested the Place on all sides. They began the same day to make a Bridge of Boats, as well for the Passage of the Troops of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as for Communication with the other side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and afterwards resolved to Attack the Town in four different Places. The first at∣tack, on the side of the lower Town was commanded by Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and carried on the by the Imperial Troops. The second on the side of the Castle, by the Elector of <HI>Ba∣varia;</HI> The third was carried on by the Troops of <HI>Saxony;</HI> and the fourth by those of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> under General <HI>Scho∣ning.</HI> The 19th Prince <HI>Charles</HI> caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Army to appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch to the Baths, and there fixed the General Quarter, with some Regiments of Foot, within a quarter of a Mile of the City. On the 21st the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> marched his Troops over the Bridge, and came to incamp at the foot of the Mount St. <HI>Gerard.</HI> The 22d the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> Grand Master of the Teutonick Order, arrived in the Camp with Count <HI>Dunevald.</HI> The next day the Christians began to batter the <HI>Wasserstadt,</HI> and having made a sufficient breach they entred it, whilst the Infidels retired into the Upper City. On the 30th the Marquess of <HI>Turlac</HI> arrived in the Camp with the Troops of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and at the same day arrived also the Auxiliary Troops of <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>Suabia,</HI> and two Compa∣nies of <HI>Passau</HI> and <HI>Ratisbonne.</HI> The 2d of <HI>July</HI> the Troops of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> arrived under the Command of the Marshal Ge∣neral <HI>Schoning.</HI> The 13th the Christians mounted and made themselves Masters of the Breach; but the <HI>Turks</HI> setting Fire to a Furnace, several Voluntiers of great Note, with a great Number of Soldiers, were killed or wounded. The 23d it was thought fit to summon the Besieged. The Count of <HI>Koningseck, Ayde de Camp</HI> General, was sent with an In∣terpreter and a Drummer to make the Summons. The Turks came to meet him, and took the Letter which they present∣ed to the Commander. There was a Truce of two Hours made on both sides. The Turks brought a Letter wrapped in Scarlet, written by the Governour, in answer to that of Prince <HI>Charles;</HI> wherein he declared that he was resolved to make a vigorous defence. After this answer there was great firing made on both sides. The 27th the Christians gave a General Assault and became Masters of three Towers, at the
<PB N="184" REF="95"/> three Quarters of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> of the Marshal of <HI>Schoning,</HI> and of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The 1st of <HI>August</HI> the Besieg∣ed sent two Agas, who offered in the name of the Visier of <HI>Buda,</HI> to remit this Place, with all its Dependencies, and what other two Towns the Emperor should make choice of, if he would make Peace; but as Prince <HI>Charles</HI> was informed, that the Emperor would do nothing but with the consent of his Allies, he dismissed the Agas. On the 14th the Turks who came to the relief of <HI>Buda</HI> appeared in Battel Ar∣ray; Prince <HI>Charles</HI> fought them, defeated them, took eight Pieces of Canon, and forty Standards with the loss of 200 Men. The next day, there were found in the Field 2200 dead Bodies of the Infidels. The 22d the <HI>Bavarians</HI> seized on one of the Towers of the Castle. The 29th the Succours of the <HI>Turks</HI> made another attempt to enter into the City, but they were repulsed by the Christians. The 31st they got advice that the Grand Visier was extreamly disatisfied with the two Bassa's who commanded the Troops which the Christians had defeated the 29th, and that his Army was but of about 30000 Men. Lastly, The 2d of <HI>September</HI> was the General Assault given: The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> accompanied with the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> began it, attacking the Castle. A little while after, Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> attended by the Prince of <HI>Croy, Newbourg</HI> and <HI>Commerci,</HI> the Generals <HI>Souches, Diepenthal, Scherssemberg,</HI> and the chief Voluntiers of the Ar∣my, marched to the Assault. After a fierce Combat which lasted an hour, the Governour being killed upon the breach, the Turks lost Courage, and retired in disorder to the foot of a Wall of the Castle. The Imperialists being entered the City made a terrible Slaughter. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> found a stronger resistance at the Castle; for the Turks who were therein their Retrenchments, not knowing that the City was taken, defended themselves with a great deal of Courage; at last, being overpowered, they set fire through despair, to several places of the City. After a great Massacre, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> caused Quarter to be given to near 2000 Men, who were retired into the Castle, whilst the Earl of <HI>Coningseck</HI> carried the same orders to the Imperialists from Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> This they did, because the Infi∣dels might have defended themselves yet a great while, for they had at their Head, the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janissaries</HI> with the Bassa's Lieutenant, the Mufti, and several other Officers, who were made Prisoners by the <HI>Bavarians.</HI> Most of the
<PB N="185" REF="95"/> Women and Children were also saved. The Infidels being disarmed some were conducted to a Mosque, and the rest left in the Castle, whilst the Fire they had kindled in the City raged so far, that the Walls of the Houses hardly es∣cap'd its fury. The next Day the two Generals visited the Place, and found in it above 400 Pieces of Artillery, four of which of an extraordinary bigness, they call the four Evan∣gelists. There was Ammunitions also found in it for more than a Month. The Christians did not lose above 100 Men in this Action, and as they were preparing to go to attack the Grand Vizier in his Camp, they were informed that he had abandon'd it. A Treasure of 300000 Ducats discovered in the City, was given to the Bassa to use as he should see occasion. There were also 60000 Sequins found, with other sums, buried in the Ground in divers places. The Library of the Ancient Kings of <HI>Hungary,</HI> so much augmented by <HI>Matthias Corvin,</HI> being not in the least damnified, was trans∣ported to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Peter-Waradin</HI> or <HI>Petro-Waradin</HI> called by the Inhabitants <HI>Petrowar</HI> Lat. <HI>Acuminium,</HI> or <HI>Petro-Varadin,</HI> is situate on the <HI>Danube</HI> between the <HI>Save</HI> and the <HI>Drave,</HI> and has been very famous during the present War. The Turks made it their common passage into upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> after the Emperors Forces had made themselves Masters of <HI>Buda,</HI> and for that purpose kept a Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube</HI> here: the Revolt and Mutiny against the prime Visier, after the Battel of <HI>Mohats,</HI> happened here, whereby that General was forc'd to fly for his Life to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and thence to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> It has since been taken and retaken by both Parties. Its Fortifications were blown up by the Imperialists in 1688. and the Town quite burnt down a little after. But the Empe∣ror in 1691. begun to refortify it, and intends to make it a place of great strength. It stands 32 Miles N. W. of <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI> and 36 S. E. of <HI>Esseck,</HI> Long. 41 d. 55 m.

<P>II. <HI>Esseck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Esseck</HI> is a Town upon the <HI>Drave</HI> which has been very fa∣mous in the Present Wars betwixt the Turks and Imperialists; The Town stands low and the Streets are plank'd with Trees. Upon one side of the Gate, is a part of a <HI>Roman</HI> Inscription <HI>M. Aelian,</HI> &amp;c. on the other a Man's head in Stone. In or near this Place <HI>Constantius</HI> defeated <HI>Magnentius</HI> the Usurper and Murtherer of <HI>Constantine</HI> II. in 359. The Town is great and populous, by reason of the Trade and Commerce, but not strong; and therefore the Turks have of late bestowed much cost and pains in fortifying it. But that which is the great wonder is the Wooden Bridge, 8585 Geometrical paces long, and 17. broad; running over the <HI>Drave,</HI> over a long Marsh and the River <HI>Fenns,</HI> from the City to the Fort of <HI>Darda,</HI> which is on the other side in the lower <HI>Hungary.</HI> It was built by <HI>Soliman</HI> the <HI>Magnificent</HI> in 1521. as soon as he had taken <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and has Rails on both sides, with Towers of Wood at every quarter of a Mile. Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> burnt part of it in 1664. which necessitated the Turks to
<PB N="207" REF="106"/> build that part a little nearer the <HI>Danube,</HI> because they could not without great charges and difficulty, pluck up the re∣mainder of the Trees which the Water had preserved from the Fire. By this Bridge the Turkish Armies used to pass between <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Near this Place the Un∣fortunate <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was defeated in 1526. in attempting to stop <HI>Soliman</HI>'s passage into his Kingdom. Count <HI>Lessy</HI> burnt this Bridge a second time in 1685. and possess'd himself of the Town of <HI>Esseck;</HI> but the Castle holding out he blew up their Magazines, plunder'd the Town and left it. In 1686. The <HI>Turks</HI> began to build it after another manner, by driving rows of Trees into the Earth, and filling up the space with Earth, that it might not be subject to be ruin'd by Fire. But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> destroyed it in 1687. drove the <HI>Turks</HI> over the <HI>Drave,</HI> and in a few days entirely ruined, what 8000 men had been many Months a Building. After the taking of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Turks sat down with an Army of 15000 Men before this place, but retired without success in 1690. It stands 65 Miles N. W. of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and 100 S.

The Cathedral of this City was of old a Temple that stood
<PB N="217" REF="111"/> in the midst of <HI>Dioclesian</HI>'s Palace. Since this Temple was changed into a Church, they have broken through the Wall to make a Quire to it, and made several Windows in it, for before it received light only by the Gate or Door, according to the Custom of the Heathens, who commonly made their Temples all dark, to render their Mysteries the more vene∣rable, by the borrowed light of many Torches and Lamps. The Walls of <HI>Dioclesian</HI>'s Palace, which contain the two thirds of the City, are in a manner whole and intire, and make an exact square, with a Gate in the midst of each side. The Country round this Place is very fruitful, and all Provisions very Cheap. It stands 30 Miles S. E. of <HI>Sebenico</HI> 74 S. E. of <HI>Zara</HI> and 92 N.

The Castle of <HI>Salimanega,</HI> which is joined to the place on the North-side is built upon a very rocky place, and is commanded by the Mountain of St. <HI>Veneranda,</HI> whence also the Tower of <HI>Fastagick,</HI> which is partly built upon the Rock, and partly upon the joining Ground, can be batter'd. This great Tower was used by the <HI>Turks</HI> as a Magazine for Powder. The high Fortress called <HI>Goringrad</HI> is 650. paces from the Town, on the Northern side, and this may be bat∣ter'd to pieces from the top of <HI>Mont-slichi,</HI> which is nigh it. This place was Attacked in 1538. by the Pope, the Empe∣ror's, and <HI>Venetian</HI> Army, and taken by them, and Garrison∣ed with <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but they put three Colours into it, one for the Pope, one for the Emperor, and a third for the Repub∣lick.

<PB N="219" REF="112"/> Men, that were joined by the <HI>Sangiac</HI> of the Province, he Battered the Place, and carried it by Assault. The <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> sustained a great Loss on this occasion, for there were 4000 of them either killed, or put to Irons. The <HI>Venetians</HI> endeavoured to retake it in 1572. but were forc'd to give over the Enterprize, yet have at last made themselves Masters of it in 1687. jointly with the Pope's Troops, and those of the Order of <HI>Malta,</HI> which fell out thus; Count <HI>Herbestein</HI> Great Prior of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and General of the Gallies of <HI>Malta,</HI> and Commander of the Pope's Seven Gallies, received Orders from the Pope to join the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army in the <HI>Morea,</HI> com∣manded by the Generalissimo <HI>Morosini,</HI> to undertake some considerable Enterprize in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> which he did upon the 7th of <HI>August</HI> 1687. and with the General <HI>Cornaro</HI> resolved upon the Siege of <HI>Castel-Nuovo;</HI> this Resolution was put in Execution the 2d of <HI>September;</HI> the 29th the <HI>Turks</HI> quitted the Town, and the next Morning those of the Castle yielded upon condition, that they might have with them what they could carry upon their Backs, with Vessels to Transport them into <HI>Albania,</HI> all which was executed the 2d of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> came out, being 9000 well-arm'd, and about a 1000 Women and Children. <HI>Castel-Nuovo</HI> stands 12 Miles W. of <HI>Cattaro.</HI> Long. 41 d. 26 m.

<PB N="220" REF="113"/> yielded <HI>Antivari</HI> to the <HI>Turks</HI> in 1571. <HI>Augustin Pasqualigo</HI> surrendred <HI>Budoa,</HI> whereof he was Governour, but was not blamed because of the weakness of the Place. <HI>Zacharias Salo∣moni</HI> Governour of <HI>Cattano,</HI> having retook it soon after with the Land ana Sea Forces, the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> took care to fortifie it, so that though it is a small Place, yet it is very Regular. It suffered much in 1667. by an Earthquake, but great care was taken to Repair the Ruins caused by this Ac∣cident. This Town is a Bishop's See Suffragan of <HI>Antivari,</HI> and stands 8 Miles N.

<HEAD>Of the Republick of <HI>Ragusi.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>RAgusi,</HI> or <HI>Ragusa,</HI> is a City and Republick upon the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> with an Archbishop's See. Some Authors esteem it to be the same with the Ancient <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> but others will have the Ruins of that City to be on the other side, in a place called <HI>Ragusi Vecchio.</HI> However it be, this City which the <HI>Selavonians</HI> call <HI>Dobronich,</HI> is very well Built. Its situation is upon a Rock, so high on one side and craggy, that 'tis a Covert to it, and on the other side it stretches
<PB N="221" REF="113"/> along a little Tongue of Land where 'tis washed by the Sea. Near this City is the Fort of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and a Port. It's Inhabited by many Merchants, and the best peopled place in <HI>Dalmatia.</HI> The Government of it is almost like unto that of the Republick of <HI>Venice.</HI> It's true, that the fear of losing their Liberty is so great, that it obliges them to change their Duke or Governour every Month, and to continue their Offi∣cers in their Posts but for six Weeks; wherefore Gentlemen cannot wear a Sword, nor lye abroad without informing the Senate therewith; and in the Night time, Strangers, and especially <HI>Turks,</HI> are lock'd up in their Lodgings by them. Moreover, the Gates of the City are never open but for three or four Hours by Day in Summer time, and not above an Hour and a half in Winter. The <HI>Ragusians</HI> pay Tribute to the <HI>Turks,</HI> whom they fear; to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whom they hate; to the Pope, Emperor, and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> upon considera∣tion. <HI>Ragusia,</HI> or the Country of <HI>Ragusa</HI> is but inconsidera∣ble, comprehending no more than the Town of that Name, <HI>Stagno,</HI> and two or three Villages. This City is very much subject to Earthquakes, and had terrible shocks in 1637. and 1667. The Senate of <HI>Ragusa</HI> is composed of Sixty Senators, whereof Forty at least, must meet together when they as∣semble for Judgment. Civil Matters, at the Commencement of the Suit, are brought before Six of the Senate, from whom there is an Appeal to the College of Thirty, who are no Senators, and if the Decrees be for Sums exceeding 500 Crowns, the Appeals are finally determin'd by the Senate. Their Judicial Proceedings are in <HI>Latin,</HI> but they plead in <HI>Italian,</HI> or the Language of the Country. Criminal Affairs are judged by an Officer, from whom there is an Appeal to a Jurisdiction composed of Six Senators, and if the Sentence be confirm'd there, the Affair is terminated; but if other∣wise, the Senate takes Cognizance thereof, and Judges it. As to Politick Affairs of lesser Importance, the Governour with Six of the Senate decides them, and these Six Senators exercise that Charge a Year. <HI>Ragusa</HI> stands 82 Miles N.

The Bishops wear a certain Cap down to their Ears, like the Hollow of a Hat without Brims. Nor do they bear crosses in their hands, but only a little crutch of <HI>Ebony,</HI> tipped with Ivory or Mo∣ther of Pearl. In the Sacrament they make use of leaven'd Bread, and administer the Sacrament in both kinds.

The Walls are Built after the old Fashion with Turrets or Towers at certain Intervals, and are about four Leagues in Circuit. It is strengthned with three Forts, the least of which is the furthest from the Walls of the City, and stands at the Landing place, mounted with twenty Pieces of Cannon; the other two are larger, and are joined to the City Wall, the Sea beating upon them, each of them planted with 40 Pieces of Cannon.

<P>I. <HI>Setines</HI> or <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Setines</HI> anciently called <HI>Athens,</HI> was one of the most famous and flourishing Cities in the World, the Capital of <HI>At∣tica,</HI> formerly a Kingdom, and the chief seat of Learn∣ing and Valour, taking its rise <HI>An. Mun.</HI> 2496. and continuing 487 years, under 17 Kings, the first whereof was <HI>Cecrops</HI> and the last <HI>Codrus</HI> Son of <HI>Melanthus.</HI> After that they were govern'd by 10 <HI>Archontes,</HI> or Rulers, during life; than by <HI>Archontes</HI> for 10 years; and at last by annual Praetors. <HI>Draco</HI> first gave 'em Laws, which were too severe, then <HI>So∣lon</HI> instituted Milder introducing Democratical Government, 594 years before our Saviour. <HI>Athens</HI> sustained many great Wars against the <HI>Persians, Lacedaemonians, Thebans, Rhodians</HI> and <HI>Macedonians.</HI> It suffered much under <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> and after his Death yet more under <HI>Antipater, Craterus</HI> and <HI>Cassander. Demetrius</HI> made it free again, but be∣ing refus'd shelter there after his defeat in <HI>Phrygia,</HI> he invest∣ed and made himself Master of the Town after a years Siege. Sometime after it shook off the <HI>Macedonian</HI> yoke, and put it self under the Protection of <HI>Rome,</HI> until <HI>Ariston</HI> making him∣self Tyrant thereof, irritated the <HI>Romans,</HI> who took and plun∣der'd it under <HI>Sylla</HI> 87 years before Christ. After this, <HI>Pom∣pey the Great</HI> permitted it the use of its Laws, for which kind∣ness it declared for him against <HI>Caesar,</HI> who after the Battel of <HI>Pharsale,</HI> when he had power to punish his Enemies, said, <HI>Truly the</HI> Athenians <HI>deserve to be chastis'd, yet in consideration of the merit of the Dead, I pardon the Living.</HI> All was Magnifi∣cent in <HI>Athens,</HI> and worth the admiration of Posterity. The <HI>Areopage,</HI> the <HI>Lycaeum,</HI> the <HI>Academy, Portique, Temple,</HI> and o∣ther fine Buildings are well described in the Works of ancient
<PB N="240" REF="123"/> Authors. St. <HI>Paul</HI> Preached here, and several Persons of Note embraced Christianism, as <HI>Dionysius</HI> the <HI>Areopagite,</HI> and a Noble Lady called <HI>Damaris.</HI> After that the Church of <HI>Athens</HI> became very considerable, for in the II. Century a great num∣ber of the <HI>Athenians</HI> suffered Martyrdom, animated by the Ex∣ample of their Bishop <HI>Publius.</HI> This happen'd in 123. un∣der <HI>Adrian,</HI> who came to <HI>Athens</HI> in 126. This City was after∣wards erected into an Archbishoprick. It is defended by a Cittadel called <HI>Acropolis,</HI> inaccessible on every side, save the West, seated in the Middle between two Hills; the one call'd <HI>Musaeum,</HI> within Cannon Shot, the other <HI>Anchesmus,</HI> which has no place to Mount Great Guns on, being Spired like a Sugar-Loaf, and having no more compass on the top, save that in which St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chappel is built, the place where formerly the Statue of <HI>Jupiter</HI> was Worshiped. The City is North of the Cittadel, and so covered by it, that it can hardly be seen on that side next the Sea, well situated and wealthy, tho' in a hot Climate, which is tempered by the North Winds. The Inhabitants are about 10000 <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> the latter have four Mosques in the City, and one in the Castle. The Citizens are reckoned Treacherous and Cun∣ning, whence comes the Proverb, <HI>From a Jew of</HI> Salonica, <HI>a Greek of</HI> Athens, and <HI>a Turk of</HI> Negropont, Good Lord De∣liver us. They speak <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> promiscuously, and differ only in Habit, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> wear closer on their Bodies. Their Women seldom stir abroad, when they do, they cover their Heads with a Veil of Calico, and throw over 'em a large Crimson Velvet or Violet colour'd Mantle with their Silver Clasps. The Maids never go abroad till their Wedding-Day, being courted by Proxies. Upon their Nup∣tials they wear a large Crown of Filigram and Pearls, and are led from Church to the Bridegrooms House, with Hautboys, Drums and other Musical Instruments playing before them. The Archbishoprick of <HI>Athens</HI> is not worth above 4000 Crowns a year; wherefore most of the Jesuits are retired to <HI>Negro∣pont.</HI> But the Consuls of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> keep each of 'em a Chappel here. The Soil about this City is fruitful in Wine and Olives, especially those called <HI>Colymbades,</HI> reserved for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s own eating, being large and well-tast∣ed. The Castle stands on the North, on a descent from the City, in which is a magnificent, large white Marble Temple, supported with beautiful Pillars of black Marble, and Por∣phyry. On the Frontispiece are the Figures of Horse-men,
<PB N="241" REF="123"/> as big as the life, prepared for Combat. Round about it are to be seen the noble Atchievements of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> in <HI>Basso Relievo,</HI> every Figure almost two Foot and a half high. Close by this Temple is a beautiful White Marble Palace much decay'd. At the Foot of the Castle are 17. Co∣lums 18 Foot in circumference, and proportionable in height the remainder of 300, which they say, formerly belong'd to the Palace of <HI>Theseus.</HI> Over the Portal, yet intire, is this Inscription in <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This ancient City of</HI> Athens <HI>is certainly the City of</HI> Theseus.</P>
<P>And another within thus,</P>
<P><HI>The City of</HI> Athens <HI>is the City of</HI> Adrian <HI>and not of</HI> Theseus.</P>
<P>Here is also the <HI>Fanari</HI> or Lantern of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> whether he retired to study in privacy. It is a small Marble Tower, with six Columns round it, and a Lamp with branches over the <HI>Duomo</HI> which covers it, whence perhaps it was called the <HI>Lantern</HI> supposed to have been dedicated to <HI>Hercules</HI> by the several Figures set in the Frises thereof combating in Lions Skins. Here are also the Ruins of the <HI>Areopagus,</HI> whose Gla∣cis, or Senate-House, 40 paces long, is supported by vast pieces cut out of the Rock, and pointed like a Diamond. In the midst thereof is a kind of Speakers Chair cut out of the Rock, with Seats round it for the Senators. Add to these the Remains of the Temple of Victory, built after the <HI>Jonick</HI> Order, where the <HI>Turks</HI> lay their Powder. The Arsenal of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> and the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> both of the Dorick Or∣der. <HI>Setines</HI> was taken by Mahomet II. in 1455. but re∣gain'd by the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1687. It stands nigh the Gulph of <HI>Engia,</HI> about 120 Miles almost N. of <HI>Misitra,</HI> 160 S. E. of <HI>Larissa</HI> and 420 S. W. of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Long. 48 d. 20 m. Lat. 37 d. 25 m.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Stives,</HI> or <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stives</HI> anciently called <HI>Thebes,</HI> was once one of the most celebrated Cities of Greece, the Capital of <HI>Baeotia</HI> the Birth place of <HI>Pindar</HI> (who calls it <HI>Heptapyle</HI> by reason of its seven Gates,) and of the renowned General <HI>Epaminondas.</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="124"/> This City sustained great Wars against the <HI>Athenians, Lace∣daemonians</HI> and <HI>Macedonians,</HI> it submitted to the last with re∣luctancy, so that upon the report of <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> be∣ing Dead, they revolted and sollicited their Neighbours to do the same: but the Town being taken a second time, it was quite destroyed, not one House being left standing, but that of <HI>Pindarus. Cassander, Antipater</HI>'s Son repair'd it 20 years after, and it had afterwards the Title of Archbishoprick, but is now an inconsiderable Borough subject to the Turks. The <HI>Venetians</HI> took it in 1687. and soon after left it again, it stands 40 Miles N. W. of <HI>Setines</HI> or <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Aulis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aulis</HI> is a City of <HI>Baeotia</HI> upon the Streight of <HI>Negropont,</HI> fa∣mous for the Harbour that belongs to it, where <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Captains rendezvouz'd before they set Sail for <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Marathon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Marathon</HI> called at this Day <HI>Marathona,</HI> or <HI>Marason,</HI> is a small Town in <HI>Attica.</HI> It is famous for the Victory which 12000 <HI>Athenians</HI> under the Command of <HI>Miltiades,</HI> obtained over the <HI>Persian</HI> Army of above 500000 Men <HI>Anno Rom.</HI> 264. towards the end of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>V. <HI>Livadia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Livadia</HI> is a Town and Castle of <HI>Achaia,</HI> from which all that Principality is now called <HI>Livadia.</HI> It is subject to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and stands 70 Miles W. of <HI>Athens</HI> or <HI>Setines.</HI></P>
<P>VI. <HI>Megara.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Megara</HI> called by the <HI>Turks Megra</HI> (the Birth-place of <HI>Eu∣clides</HI>) was anciently a famous City, built upon two Rocks, but now one is Desolate, and the other has but about 3 or 400 pitiful Cottages built one story high, and close toge∣ther,
<PB N="243" REF="124"/> the Walls of which are but the Ruins of the former Houses, or a few Fagots covered with Clay. A place at first Capital of a Monarchy, under the Reign of 12 Kings, than a Republick, which maintained divers Wars with the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI> and others, and established a Colony in the Island of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>VII. <HI>Delphos.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Delphos</HI> or <HI>Delphes</HI> is a little Village of <HI>Phocis,</HI> under Mount <HI>Parnassus,</HI> famous in ancient History for the Temple of <HI>A∣pollo,</HI> whence he pronounced his Oracles.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>Lepanto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lepanto</HI> Lat. <HI>Naupactus,</HI> is a City of <HI>Aetolia,</HI> (now <HI>Livadia</HI>) a Country of <HI>Achaia,</HI> called by the <HI>Turks, Einebachri,</HI> seated near the entrance of the Western Bay of <HI>Corinth,</HI> now called the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> This City is built on the South-side of a Mountain formed like a Sugar Loaf, on the top of which is a strong Castle, surrounded with four strong Walls set at some distance one above the other; between which Walls the Inhabitants have their Houses, and by them the City is divided into four Parts. The Port is very handsome and beautiful, and may be secured by a Chain. The Mouth of it is so strait, it will hold but a few Ships, and those cannot go out and in at sometimes neither for want of Water. The Country round this City is pleasant and full of delightful Gar∣dens. The Wine of <HI>Lepanto</HI> is the best of all <HI>Greece;</HI> but they pitch their Vessels as they do generally over all <HI>Morea,</HI> and at <HI>Athens,</HI> to preserve the Wine (as the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> are wont to Sulphurate them for the same purpose) which renders the Taste, at first, somewhat disagreeable to Strangers. The <HI>Turks</HI> have five or six Mosques here, and the <HI>Greeks</HI> have two Churches, one in each Suburb, tho' but very small, and they but few in number, and ill treated, for which reason their Archbishop kept his residence at <HI>Marta.</HI> The Jews have three Synagogues there. The Chiefest Com∣modities of the Place are, Leather, Oyl, Wheat, Tobacco, Rice and Barley; but the most considerable of all the rest is <HI>Turkey</HI> Leather. In 1408. this City was under the Empire of
<PB N="244" REF="125"/> <HI>Greece,</HI> but <HI>Emanuel</HI> then Emperor assigned it to the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI> who took care to fortifie it as it is now. In 1475. <HI>Ma∣homet the Great,</HI> the same that took <HI>Constantinople</HI> having gain∣ed <HI>Corinth,</HI> besieged it with an Army of 30000 Men, but was forced to raise the Siege, but in 1498. <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. attack'd it with an 150000 Men, and took it by the Treachery of the Venetian Governour, whom he had corrupted with Money. In 1687. The <HI>Venetians</HI> having in the foregoing years almost beat the Turks out of all the <HI>Morea,</HI> their General <HI>Morosini</HI> landed near <HI>Patras,</HI> notwithstanding all the opposition of the Seraskier, whom he fought and defeated on the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> and having taken <HI>Patras</HI> and the <HI>Dardanel</HI> Castle on that side; he crossed to the other to <HI>Lepanto,</HI> where he found the <HI>Turks</HI> making haste to empty the Place for him, whereup∣on he took possession of it with out striking a blow, and found in it 120 Pieces of Brass Cannon. <HI>Lepanto</HI> stands 100 Miles S. E. of <HI>Prevesa</HI> 140 W. of <HI>Setines,</HI> and 480 S. W. of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> Long. 45 d. 30 m. Lat. 37 d. 25 m.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Dardanels</HI> of <HI>Lepanto.</HI></P>
<P>At the Entrance of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> are two Capes, about 13 or 14 Miles S. W. of <HI>Lepanto;</HI> that which joins to <HI>Morea</HI> is called by the Ancients, <HI>Anthirium Promontorium,</HI> now adays <HI>Cape Antirio,</HI> and has a little Fortress called the Castle of <HI>Morea</HI> or of <HI>Patras;</HI> The other that joins to <HI>Achaia,</HI> is called by <HI>Strabo, Rhium Promontorium,</HI> vulgarly Cape <HI>Rio,</HI> and has also a little Fort called Castle of <HI>Romelia.</HI></P>
<P>These two Castles are also called <HI>Dardanels</HI> of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> in allusion to those of the <HI>Hellespont.</HI> Their Figure is square, environed with strong Walls, mounted with good Cannon even with the Water. All the Commodities that go out of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> pay here a Toll, which comes to about 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Famous <HI>Sea-Fight</HI> of <HI>Lepanto</HI> in <HI>1571.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It was near the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> that a famous Sea-Fight was fought against the <HI>Turks, Octob.</HI> 2. 1571. in which they lost above 30000 Men, being the most bloody defeat they ever met with since the first establishment of their Empire.
<PB N="245" REF="125"/> Besides the slaughter, the <HI>Christians</HI> took 5000 Prisoners, amongst whom, were the two Sons of <HI>Haly,</HI> General of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet. They took also 130 Galleys, stranded, burnt, or sunk 90. and redeemed near 20000 <HI>Christian-Slaves.</HI> Nei∣ther was the Booty less considerable, for their Fleet pillaged all the Isles thereabouts, and took many Merchant-Men.

<P>The Principal Rivers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> in this beautiful Country are,</P>
<P N="1">1. The River <HI>Carbon</HI> (formerly called <HI>Orsea, Alpheus,</HI> or <HI>Alpehius,</HI> and <HI>Strimphalus</HI> or <HI>Nyctymus Fluvius</HI>) so much famed for its Virtue of taking away the spots and blemishes of the Skin, which besides 140 Torrents or Brooks receives the Rivers <HI>Celadon, Erimanthus,</HI> and <HI>Amarinthe.</HI> The Poets feigned that it ran under the Sea into <HI>Sicily,</HI> to be joined with the Waters of the Spring <HI>Arethusa,</HI> because it goes often un∣der the Ground, and comes out always with more strength.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Vasili Potamos,</HI> formerly <HI>Eurotas, Iris, Hemerus,</HI> and <HI>Marthaton</HI>) which rises at the same place where the River <HI>Carbon</HI> has its Source, and washing <HI>Misitra,</HI> discharges it self in the Gulf of <HI>Colchine.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> after several Revolutions, fell into the Hands of <HI>Emanuel</HI> a Greek Emperor about 1150. who at his Death, having divided his Empire among his Seven Sons, was thereby the Cause of its Ruin. These Princes were called <HI>Despotes,</HI> that is, Lords or Governours; they depended upon the Em∣peror, both as to their Government and Election; otherwise they were absolute, and their Dignity almost Hereditary, for it seldom hapned that the Emperor chused any Successor to the late <HI>Despote,</HI> but his Son, Brother, or near Relation. <HI>Constantine</HI> sirnamed <HI>Dragares</HI> Brother of <HI>Theodorus</HI> II. was Despote, when <HI>Amurat</HI> made an Irruption into <HI>Morea.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> Emperor stopt his fury by the Promise of a yearly Tri∣bute.

<P>I. <HI>Patras.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Patras,</HI> is a very Ancient and Flourishing City, called by the <HI>Turks Badra</HI> and <HI>Balabutra;</HI> it is seated near <HI>Cape Rio</HI> on
<PB N="249" REF="127"/> the North side of a Mountain, on the top of which stands a good Fortress, 18 Miles almost S. of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> and 120 N. W. of <HI>Misitra.</HI> Long. 45 d. 40 m. Lat. 37 d. 20 m. It is the Capital of the Dutchy of <HI>Chiarenza,</HI> and an Archbishoprick. Towards the beginning of the <HI>Roman</HI> Monarchy, this City had a great number of Inhabitants, by reason both of its commodious Situation for Trade, and of the Fer∣tility of its Soil. It is about five Miles distant from the Gulf that bears its Name, where it has a good Sea-port called <HI>Panormus,</HI> which the Emperor <HI>Augustus</HI> chused for the Retreat of his Navy; and for that Reason made the In∣habitants of <HI>Patras, Citizens of Rome,</HI> and granted them several Immunities and Priviledges, which gave occasion to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> to call this City, <HI>Augusta Aroe Patrensis.</HI> The Goddess <HI>Diana</HI> was worshipped here under the Name of <HI>Diana Latria,</HI> and had a yearly Sacrifice offered her of a young Man, and a Maid pickt out of the handsomest in all the City. This Su∣perstitious and Bloody Sacrifice continued till <HI>Euripiles</HI> came to <HI>Patras,</HI> and was made a Christian Convert by the Apostle St. <HI>Andrew. Patras</HI> is now very well peopled, especially with <HI>Jews,</HI> who drive a great Trade there with the <HI>Grecians</HI> of the Neighbouring Islands, and the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Mer∣chants. Its Air is none of the wholesomest, by reason of the Neighbouring Mountains covered with Snow, almost all the Year round, and of the Waters that surround it. This City, with the Territory belonging to it, was formerly in the Pos∣session of the Despotes of <HI>Greece,</HI> the last of which not being able to keep it against the <HI>Turks,</HI> sold it in 1408. to the Re∣publick of <HI>Venice.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> took it from the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1463. but in 1533. they retook it from the <HI>Turks</HI> under the Command of General <HI>Doria.</HI> The next Year after the <HI>Turks</HI> expelled the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who took it again in 1687. after their General <HI>Morosini</HI> had given the <HI>Turks</HI> a considerable overthrow in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Chiarenza.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chiarenza,</HI> which is thought to be the Ancient <HI>Cyllene,</HI> stands on the right side of the River <HI>Inachus,</HI> called by <HI>Ptolo∣my, Penaeus Fluvius,</HI> upon a Hill near the Gulph of <HI>Patras.</HI> It has been a famous City, and the Capital of the Dukedom of the same Name, under its own Princes. The <HI>Venetians</HI>
<PB N="250" REF="128"/> made themselves Masters of it, when it was still in a pretty good condition. But it is now so extreamly changed, that there is scarce any thing to be seen besides its Ditches, and some miserable Vestiges of what it has been. Its Port which was capable of many good Ships, is now filled up with Sands. It stands about 25 Miles S. W. of <HI>Patras.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Caminitza.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caminitza,</HI> called by <HI>Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy, Olenus,</HI> and by <HI>Pliny, Olenum,</HI> stands three Miles from the Gulph of <HI>Patras,</HI> on the right Bank of the little River <HI>Pirus,</HI> betwixt the Cape of <HI>Chiarenza</HI> and <HI>Patras,</HI> at an equal distance from each. It owes its Foundation to <HI>Olenus</HI> Son of <HI>Vulcan;</HI> but tho' it has been a great City with a Bishop's See Suffragan of the Arch∣bishoprick of <HI>Patras;</HI> it is now reduced to a small inconside∣rable Borough.</P>

<P><HI>MOdon,</HI> called by the <HI>Turks, Mutum,</HI> anciently <HI>Methone,</HI> is in that part of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> formerly called <HI>Messenia:</HI> It is a strong, rich and trading City, with a Bishop's See under the Archbishop of <HI>Patras.</HI> Its Seat is very advantagious, being upon a Cape of the Sea of <HI>Sapienza,</HI> at the Foot of which is a fair and good Port. This City was the ordinary Residence of the Sangiac or Governour of <HI>Morea</HI> for the Grand <HI>Seignior.</HI> It has at several times undergone several Revolu∣tions. The Emperor <HI>Trajanus</HI> granted it great Priviledges, which were confirmed upon it by <HI>Constantine the Great.</HI> In 1124. the <HI>Venetians</HI> made themselves Masters of it, under the Doge <HI>Domenico Michiole,</HI> but the Emperor of <HI>Constantinople</HI> retook it the next Year after. In 1204. upon the Division of the Em∣pire it fell again into the Possession of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from whom it was taken by <HI>Leo Veteran</HI> a famous Pyrate of <HI>Genoa.</HI> This Usurper did not enjoy it long, for being taken in the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> he was brought to <HI>Corfu,</HI> where he suffered an Ignominious Death, which so frighted his Party, that the Captains <HI>Dandolo</HI> and <HI>Promalino</HI> made themselves Masters of <HI>Modon</HI> without any opposition. In 1498. <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. laid Siege to it with an Army of 150000 Men, and took it after a sharp Battel with the Army of the <HI>Venetians.</HI> which came to relieve it. In 1659. <HI>Morosini</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> General took it from the <HI>Turks,</HI> but they regained it in the end of the <HI>Candi∣an</HI> War. In 1686. the <HI>Venetian</HI> Arms again prevailed to de∣liver this noble and strong City out of the Hands of the Infi∣dels.
<PB N="252" REF="129"/> They found in it 90 Pieces of Cannon. <HI>Modon</HI> stand 15 Miles S. W. of <HI>Coron,</HI> and 70 almost W. of <HI>Cape Matapan.</HI> Long. 40 d. Lat. 34 d. 58 m.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Coron.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coron,</HI> has a strong and commodious situation on the left side of <HI>Cape Gallo,</HI> called by <HI>Ptolomy, Acritas Promontorium,</HI> once a Bishop's See under the Archbishop of <HI>Patras.</HI> It was anciently accounted a Colony of the <HI>Thebans</HI> called <HI>Pedasus</HI> by the Poets; <HI>Epea</HI> by <HI>Pausanias,</HI> and <HI>Corone</HI> by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny.</HI> The Figure of this City is an irregular <HI>Triangle.</HI> At one of the Angles there is a great Tower built in 1463. by the <HI>Venetians</HI> for a Magazine; the two other sides that are not washed by the Gulph that bears its Name, leave a space wide enough to go round the Fortress, which is environ'd with an old Wall, of an unequal thickness, flank'd with great Towers; and a little way further towards the East, there is a Suburb with 500 Houses. This City has had several Masters. <HI>Baudrand</HI> thinks that it was yielded to the <HI>Venetians</HI> by the Despotes Princes of <HI>Morea;</HI> but <HI>Verdizzotti</HI> assures us that they never had it before the Division of the Eastern Empire. In 1204. it was surprized by <HI>Leo Veteran</HI> a <HI>Genoese</HI> Pyrate; but after he had been Executed at <HI>Corfu, Coron</HI> returned to its Lawful Masters the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from whom it was taken by the formidable Army of <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. in 1498. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> under General <HI>Doria</HI> took it from the <HI>Turks</HI> in 1533. and soon after were forced to leave it. In 1685. Ge∣neral <HI>Francisco Morosini</HI> made himself Master of <HI>Coron</HI> not∣withstanding the Vigorous Defence of the Besieged, and the Succours that came to their Relief. Several Men of Note lost their Lives during the Siege, which lasted 49 days; and among the others the Commandeur <HI>La Tour,</HI> General of the Land Forces of <HI>Maltha,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Brunswic,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and Captain <HI>Ravagnin.</HI> All the <HI>Turkish</HI> Garrison was put to the Sword. This Town stands 15 Miles N. E. of <HI>Modon.</HI> Long. 46 d. 20 m. 35 d.</P>

<P>III. <HI>Calamata.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Calamata,</HI> called by <HI>Baudrand, Thelame, Theramme, Thu∣ria,</HI> and <HI>Abia,</HI> is an unwalled Town of the left side of the Ri∣ver <HI>Spirnazza,</HI> or <HI>Pamissus.</HI> It is seated in an open Country of the Province of <HI>Belvedere,</HI> is pretty well peopled, and had a good strong Castle of a Regular Fabrick. In 1659. Gene∣ral <HI>Morosini</HI> made himself Master of it by a Stratagem, and a∣bandon'd it, after he had burn'd it, and the Country round it. The same General took this Castle again in 1685. and soon after caused it to be razed.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Navarin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Navarin,</HI> or <HI>Zunchio,</HI> Lat. <HI>Navarinum, Nelea, Pylus Mes∣seniaca,</HI> the Birth-place of the famous <HI>Nestor,</HI> is called <HI>Ja∣varin</HI> by the <HI>Turks.</HI> It is divided into the new and old City. The old is built upon a steep Rock, which runs into the Sea, and makes its situation very strong, besides what Art has done to render it, as it were, impregnable. On the left side thereof is the new City on the side of a Hill, fortified with good Walls, and a Cittadel with six Bastions, built by the <HI>Turks</HI> in 1572. at the bottom whereof is a Haven, the best and most capacious of all the <HI>Morea.</HI> The entrance of this Harbour is commanded by the Cannon of the old <HI>Navarin.</HI> In 1644. <HI>Sultan Ibrahim</HI> chose this Haven for the Rendezvouz of his Fleet, consisting of 200 Sail, design'd against <HI>Candia.</HI> In 1498. the <HI>Turks</HI> after the Surrender of <HI>Modon,</HI> took <HI>Navarin</HI> from the <HI>Venetians</HI> and kept it till 1686. when General <HI>Mo∣rosini</HI> appearing before old <HI>Navarin</HI> with 200 Sail, Command∣ed by General <HI>Coningsmark,</HI> forced the Garrison to a Surren∣der: But the <HI>New Town</HI> made a stout Defence, in hopes of being Relieved by the Serasquier of <HI>Morea,</HI> then upon his March. General <HI>Coningsmark</HI> leaving the Management of the Siege to Chevalier <HI>Alcenago,</HI> fought and defeated the Seras∣quier, upon which the Town Surrendred.

<P><HI>Malvasia,</HI> or <HI>Napoli di Malvasia,</HI> anciently called <HI>Epidau∣rus,</HI> or <HI>Epidaurus Limera,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Monembusia,</HI> is seated near the farthest South-Eastern Cape called <HI>Cape Ma∣leo,</HI> with an Archbishoprick under the Patriarch of <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI> Is is built upon a Rock, whence it has a pleasant Prospect, both into the Sea, and the adjacent Country. It is also surrounded with the Sea, and joined to the Continent by a Timber-bridge, yet it has Springs of good fresh Water, sufficient both to serve the City and their Gardens. This
<PB N="255" REF="130"/> City is of a very great strength, being only approachable on the South side, and there it is defended by a good Tripple Wall. Next to this Wall there is a Suburb with a good num∣ber of Houses, walled about with a strong Rampart. There is also a very convenient Harbour defended by the Fortress. Its Soil is very fruitful in Grapes, of which is made the most exquisite Wine in all <HI>Greece,</HI> and so much fam'd through all the World: It yields also as much Corn as serves to maintain 60 Persons, which considering the natural strength of the Place, are enough for a Garrison. This City owes its Foundation to a Colony of <HI>Argos;</HI> and was anciently famous, and much frequented, on account of <HI>Aesculapius</HI>'s Temple. Tho' this place seem impregnable, yet it was taken in 1204. from the Emperor of the East, by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> under the Command of <HI>Baldwin</HI> Count of <HI>Flanders,</HI> (the same that was Crowned Emperor of <HI>Constantinople</HI>) and retaken again from <HI>William</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Baron, to whom it was given by <HI>Baldwin.</HI> Whereupon he resigned his Right to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who at∣tacked it with a powerful Fleet, and kept it till 1537. that they Surrendred it to <HI>Soliman</HI> to Purchase a Peace. In the <HI>Candian</HI> War they took it again by Storm, plundered, burnt it, put most of the Inhabitants ro the Sword, carried away the Cannon, and then left it. The <HI>Turks</HI> afterwards re∣builded it. In 1689. the <HI>Venetians</HI> Besieged it again, under the Command of the Doge <HI>Morosini,</HI> who being called home by the Senate on <HI>Septemb.</HI> 14. left it block'd up by three Forts, and a Squadron of light Frigats. On the 10th of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> 1690. it was Surrendred to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> being the last Town in the <HI>Morea</HI> that withstood them. It stands 50 Miles almost E. of <HI>Misitra,</HI> and 100 S. of <HI>Setines.</HI> Long. 48 d. 5 m. Lat. 35 d. 40 m.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Misitra.</HI></P>
<P>This City was first called <HI>Sparta,</HI> then <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> and now <HI>Misitra:</HI> It is one of the Antientest of the World, and the most famous of <HI>Greece.</HI> Authors vary much about its Foundation; some ascribe it to <HI>Spartus,</HI> Son to King <HI>Amicla,</HI> others to <HI>Sparta,</HI> Wife to a King of <HI>Lacedemon;</HI> others to <HI>Ce∣crops,</HI> who also founded <HI>Athens;</HI> and others assure us, that it was founded by <HI>Spartus</HI> Son to <HI>Phoroneus</HI> King of <HI>Argos,</HI> in Patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI>'s time, 1763. Years before our Saviour. In
<PB N="256" REF="131"/> <HI>Polybius</HI>'s time it was of a round Figure five or six Miles about, being Commanded by Mount <HI>Taigetus</HI> on the West. This City now has but the Miserable Ruins of its former Greatness: It is divided into four Quarters separated from each other. The Castle makes one, the Land another, and two Suburbs, called <HI>Melokorion</HI> (or the middle Suburb) and <HI>Exokorion</HI> (or the outward Suburb). The <HI>Exokorion</HI> is seperated from the other three by the River <HI>Vasoli Potamos,</HI> but has Communica∣tion with them by a Stone-bridge. The Castle called <HI>To Ca∣stron</HI> has very good Walls, and is so advantagiously seated on a rising Ground, that some Historians assure it was never ta∣ken by open force, either by the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Venetians,</HI> Never∣theless General <HI>Morosini</HI> made himself Master of it in 1687. It stands 120 Miles almost S. of <HI>Setines,</HI> 150 S. E. of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> and 526 S. W. of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Long. 47 d. 32 m. Lat. 35 d. 26m.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Zarnata.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zarnata,</HI> is a Fortress which both Art and Nature have conspired to make strong, being seated on a very pleasant rising Ground, and defended with Towers and other For∣tifications. In 1685. the Garrison frighted at the approach of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army Surrendred to General <HI>Morosini</HI> upon Articles. It stands 25 Miles almost W. of <HI>Misitra.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Chielefa.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chielefa,</HI> is a considerable Fortress seated on a steep Rock, of a square Figure, environ'd with good Walls, flank'd with five huge Towers: It is a Mile in circumference, and stands about two Miles off the Sea, and 17 N. of <HI>Cape Matapan,</HI> near the place where <HI>Vitulo</HI> a famous trading City stood formerly, which has given its Name to <HI>Port Vitulo,</HI> now little frequented, because it is neither safe nor commodious. In 1685. <HI>Chielefa</HI> Surrendred to General <HI>Morosini.</HI> The next Year after the <HI>Turks</HI> endeavouring to regain this Place, were routed and put to flight by the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>

The Sea round this Cape is very deep, and has there two good Ports; the first is called the <HI>Port of Quails,</HI> by reason of the prodigious number of Quails that fly thither; the other is called the Port of <HI>Maina.</HI> Be∣twixt these two Ports, and upon the Ruins of the Ancient <HI>Cersapolis,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> built formerly a Fortress which they called <HI>Turcotigi, Oliminias</HI> add <HI>Monige,</HI> which the <HI>Greeks</HI> In∣terpret <HI>Castro di Maini.</HI> In 1570. the <HI>Venetians</HI> took this Fort and razed it.</P>

Besides the advantages of the situation, which render this City one of the strongest in <HI>Europe,</HI> it is defended by a Cittadel Built on a Rock in the Sea, a hundred Yards off the City, which consequently cannot be Attack'd by Land. <HI>Napoli</HI> was formerly a Bishop∣rick Suffragan ef <HI>Corinth,</HI> but now it is an Archbishop's See, and the ordinary Residence of the Governour of the Province, which is Inhabited by 60000 <HI>Greeks,</HI> besides a vast number of Strangers of several Nations.

<PB N="259" REF="132"/> General <HI>Coningsmark</HI> to possess himself of Mount <HI>Pala∣mida,</HI> which is within Musket-shot of the Town, and com∣mands it; and whilst he battered it from this Place, <HI>Morosini</HI> gave Battel to the <HI>Serasquier</HI> that came to relieve it, defeated him, and took <HI>Argos,</HI> their Fleet at the same time taking <HI>Ter∣nis. Aug.</HI> the 29th the <HI>Serasquier</HI> advanced again with a 1000 Men, and fell upon the <HI>Venetians</HI> in their Trenches, where the Battel was dubious for three Hours, but at last the <HI>Turks</HI> fled. After the Battel the Siege was pusht on with vigour, and the <HI>Turks</HI> Capitulated to Surrender, on the usual Terms, and were conducted to <HI>Tenedos.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Argos.</HI></P>
<P>There have been three Cities called by this Name, the first is <HI>Argos Amphilochium</HI> in <HI>Epirus;</HI> the second <HI>Argos Pelas∣gicum</HI> in <HI>Macedon;</HI> and lastly <HI>Argos Peloponnesiacum,</HI> of which we are now to Treat. It has been anciently called <HI>Phoronia, Hippobote, Jasia, Diposia, Jappia,</HI> and lastly, <HI>Argos.</HI> It was formerly the Capital of the famous Province of <HI>Argia</HI> or <HI>Argo∣lis,</HI> and one of the most Celebrated Cities of <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> It is seated on the River <HI>Planissa,</HI> Lat. <HI>Inachus Fluvius</HI> 7 Miles almost W. of <HI>Napoli di Romania.</HI> It was first a Bishoprick under the Archbishop of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and then erected into a Metropolitan it self. It has the Mount <HI>Cronia</HI> on the West, and the Ruins of old <HI>Mycene</HI> on the South.</P>
<P>This City has undergone so many Vicissitudes, that it has now but the bare Name left as a Memorial of its Ancient Greatness and Splendor; the Magnificence of its Buildings being reduced to some pitiful paltry Houses, and a Cittadel. This City was sold to the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1388. by <HI>Mary Erigana,</HI> or <HI>Anguien,</HI> in whose Hands it remained till <HI>Mahomet</HI> II's time. The <HI>Venetians</HI> took it from the <HI>Turks</HI> in 1463. and lost it again a little while after. But in the Year 1686. Ge∣neral <HI>Morosini</HI> recovered it again from the <HI>Tarks.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Corinth,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Coranto; Gerame</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Ephyro</HI> by <HI>Lauremberg,</HI> is seated in the middle of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> to which it gives its Name. It has the Title
<PB N="260" REF="133"/> of an Archbishoprick, and stands 85 Miles E. of <HI>Patras,</HI> and 54 S. W. of <HI>Athens.</HI> It is commanded by the famous Fortress called <HI>Acrocorinth,</HI> which is near it. Its Situation is so ad∣vantageous, that it is called by some the Eye, and the Bulwark of <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> The Romans upon pretence of an affront offered to their Ambassadors, sent the Consul L. <HI>Mamius</HI> who burn'd and pillaged this City <HI>Anno Mundi</HI> 3818. but by the Care and Magnificence of <HI>Augustus</HI> it recovered its former Beauty and Riches. Since that time it has often felt the fury of War, especially under <HI>Amurath</HI> II. and <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Son, so that it has now but the miserable ruins of its former Great∣ness, and 20 or 30 Houses or rather Cottages, it is subject to the <HI>Venetias</HI> since 1687.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Corinth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Corinth,</HI> Lat. <HI>Isthmus Argolicus</HI> and <HI>Corinthia∣cus,</HI> is a neck of land about six or seven Miles broad betwixt the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> and that of <HI>Engia</HI> which joins <HI>Morea</HI> to <HI>Achaia.</HI> It was anciently very famous for the <HI>Ludi Isthmii</HI> or <HI>Isthmian Games,</HI> instituted here by <HI>Theseus,</HI> as also for its Theater, <HI>Stadium, Neptunes</HI> Temple and the Forest of Pine∣Trees, whose Leaves served to Crown the Combatants. Se∣veral Princes as, <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great, Pitia, Demetrius, Ju∣lius Caesar, Caligula, Nero</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> either to advance Navigation and Trade, or meerly to raise a Monu∣ment to their Fame, have at different times attempted the digging through of this <HI>Isthmus;</HI> but whether interrupted by more important business, or wearied with the tediousness of the Work, they have all of them left it unfinished. Whence came the Latin Proverb, <HI>Istmum fodere,</HI> against those who undertake things beyond their strength. Afterwards on this neck of Land a Wall was built, which was called <HI>Hexa∣milon</HI> because it contained six Miles, which is the whole breadth of the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> This Wall was demolished by <HI>Amu∣rath</HI> II. and being rebuilt and fortified by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> was a second time pulled down by <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. in 1443.</P>

<P>I. <HI>Corfu.</HI></P>
<P>This is one of the most considerable Islands under the <HI>Ve∣netians.</HI> It has had several Names some call it <HI>Scheria,</HI> others <HI>Drepano, Ephira, Corintoa, Effiso, Cassiopea, Argos, Ceraunia, Cercira,</HI> and <HI>Corcyra,</HI> from which lost its present Name of <HI>Corfu</HI> is derived. It is 70 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles long W. and E. and 20 Miles broad in some Places, 12 in others, and 120 in com∣pass; its Soil is very fruitful, abounding with Corn, Honey, Wine, and very good Oyl. The Air is serene, mild and tem∣perate, which may be easily believed, if we consider the Forests of <HI>Cedar</HI> and <HI>Orange</HI> Trees, that grow there.</P>
<P>There are 100 Villages or Castles and a Town that bears the name of the Island, in all which they reckon about 41000 Inhabitants. The City of <HI>Corfu</HI> is seated in the middle of the Island with a very strong Fortress, built upon a steep Rock whose foot is washed by the Sea. It is an Archbishops See, and is governed by six Nobles, which are sent thieher every other year by the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> who is in pos∣session of this Island, since 1327. Before that time it was subject to the Kings of <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Curzolaires Islands.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Curzolaires</HI> Islands are five in number, they were known to the Ancients, under the name of <HI>Echinades</HI> or <HI>E∣chinae;</HI> the greatest of them are <HI>Same</HI> and <HI>Dulichio,</HI> about a Mile from the Continent, and 31 Miles W. of <HI>Lepanto.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Santa Maura.</HI></P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Santa Maura</HI> or <HI>Lefcade</HI> was called by the An∣cients <HI>Leucus,</HI> or <HI>Leucadia.</HI> It was formerly a Peninsule, joined to the Continent of <HI>Achaia,</HI> but the People of that Country digged it into an Island. It is 70 Italian Miles in Compass; abounds with Corn, Wine, Oyl, Tobacco, and all manner of Fruits. This Island has 30 Villages, and the City of <HI>Santa Maura</HI> which is environ'd by the Sea, betwixt <HI>Lef∣cade</HI> and the Continent, and is joined to this, by several lit∣tle
<PB N="264" REF="135" MS="y"/> Islands, which communicate to one another by Bridges, and by an Aqueduct supported by 360 Arches. Its Walls are of an Eptogonal irregular figure flank'd with five great Towers: to the East, it has an Harbour called <HI>Damata.</HI> General <HI>Morosini</HI> made himself Master of it in <HI>July</HI> 1684.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Cefalonia.</HI></P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Cesalonia,</HI> was formerly called <HI>Melena</HI> by some, <HI>Samo,</HI> or <HI>Same, Dulichio, Tilebi, Casso</HI> and <HI>Chieffali</HI> by others. It lies on the S. of <HI>Corfu,</HI> and is 170 Italian Miles in compass. It is very fruitful in Corn and Fruits; The Trees bear twice in the year, and the Wheat they sow in the spring, is reap'd in <HI>June.</HI> There grow also Lemons of an extraordi∣nary bigness; and great quantities of Raisins which are trans∣ported into <HI>England.</HI> Besides several Villages and Boroughs, there is a City that has the same name with the Island, and the Fortress of <HI>Asso.</HI></P>
<P>The CIty of <HI>Cephalonia</HI> is a Bishop's See, its Cathedral is an Annex of that of <HI>Zanteg,</HI> it is the Seat of the Governour who is a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Proveditor.</HI></P>
<P>The Fortress of <HI>Asso</HI> was built by the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1595. on a very high steep Rock, surrounded with the Sea, so that it is accounted inaccessible. The Fortifications are raised ac∣cording to its Situation which is very Irregular, this Fortress is joined to the Island of <HI>Cefalonia</HI> by a Neck of Land about 20 Paces broad.</P>
<P>This Island was freely given to the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1224 by one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ajus</HI> its Lord and Governour.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Teacchi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teacchi,</HI> called <HI>Itaca</HI> by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny, Nericia, Val di Compagno, Val di Compare, Cephalonia Picciola,</HI> by others, <HI>Tiachi</HI> by the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Phiacchi</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> lies on the N. E. of <HI>Cefalonia,</HI> from which it is separated by a Channel 20 Italian Miles long, and five broad. This Island is famous in Antiquity for being the Country of <HI>Ʋlysses,</HI> and the Re∣sidence of the Chast <HI>Penelope</HI> during the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> The Inhabitants are 15000 in number, which are Governed by
<PB N="265" REF="135"/> one of the Citizens of <HI>Cefalonia,</HI> sent thither every year with the Title of <HI>Capitan</HI> of <HI>Teacchi.</HI></P>
<P>VI. <HI>Zante.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zante</HI> was called <HI>Zacyn</HI> thus by the Ancients. The North of this Island is full of Craggy steep Rocks, but to the South it has fine, delightful Plains covered with Fruit-Trees of all sorts. Besides a great number of Villages, there is a Town and Castle that bears the name of the Island, with the Title of a Bishoprick, and the ordinary residence of the Governour or Proveditor of the Island, who is a Noble Venetian. He has two Counsellors under him, and the Place of all three, lasts two years. The Castle is built on a Hill that commands all the Island; at the foot of the Town, which stretches along the Sea side the space of two Miles. They make there vast quantities of Raisins, strong racy Wines, and most excellent Oyls, to the value of 50000 Ducats <HI>per An.</HI></P>
<P>Most of the Inhabitants are <HI>Grecians,</HI> who profess the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion; the Latins, including the Soldiers, make but an inconfiderable number. There are about 3000 <HI>Jews,</HI> who have there three Synagogue, and thrive a very great Trade. There are also some <HI>English</HI> Merchants, most of them, Pro∣testant. This Island is subject to frequent Earth-quakes which is the reason, why they built their Houses generally but one Story high. There are in this Island several <HI>Greek</HI> Churches and Religious Houses to the number of 44. under the Government of a Bishop, who is to be chosen by the <HI>Greek</HI> Curates of all the Island. None are admitted to that Dignity, but those who have profest the Monastical Life of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> which is the reason, why there are here, so many Houses of that Order. The Bishop has no Revenue besides the free Gifts of the People, and his Fees for Ordination both which, amount to a considerable sum of Money.</P>
<P>This Island was sold to the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> by <HI>Robert Tarente</HI> in 1350. with several other Islands.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Strivales</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Strivales</HI> are two little Islands, called by Seamen <HI>Stamfane,</HI> and by the Ancients <HI>Strophades, Strivali, Strom∣phides,</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="136"/> and <HI>Calydnes.</HI> They stand low, and almost reach to the Water; their Haven is 50 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles distant from <HI>Cefalonia.</HI> They are very small, the greatest of the two not being above four Miles in Compass: Yet they yield great quantity of Grapes, out of which extraordinary good Wine is made. There are no other Inhabitants but a sort of Monks called <HI>Caloyers,</HI> who have Built their Convent like a Fortress defended with good Cannon to secure them∣selves from the Assaults of the <HI>Turks.</HI> These Islands are fa∣mous in the Ancient Poets, who feign'd them to be the Dwelling-place of the <HI>Harpies.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Article II.</HI> Islands in the Sea of <HI>Sapienza,</HI> and <HI>Candia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are in these Seas but three little Islands, and two great ones, called <HI>Cerigo</HI> and <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P>The first of the three is called <HI>Sphagia,</HI> or <HI>Sphateria,</HI> or <HI>Sfragia,</HI> vulgarly of <HI>Sapienza.</HI></P>
<P>The second is called <HI>Cabrera,</HI> or <HI>Fuschella,</HI> or <HI>Teganuse,</HI> and <HI>Cauriera.</HI></P>
<P>The third is called <HI>Venetico.</HI> Near these Islands are many Rocks, where the Pyrates of <HI>Barbary</HI> use to watch the Mer∣chant-Men which come out of the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> or from <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>Cerigo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cerigo,</HI> is an Island of the Sea of <HI>Sapienza</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Colochina,</HI> about six Miles distant from the Continent. It was formerly called <HI>Cytherea, Porphyrusa,</HI> and <HI>Schothera.</HI> It is 60 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles in Compass. The City that bears the Name of the Island, has the Title of a Bishoprick. Both Art and Nature have contributed to make it strong. It is Built upon a high craggy Rock, on the Sea-side, with good Bastions (tho' irregular) defended with Cannon. At the foot of this Fortress there is a Haven not much frequented, because it is narrow, and exposed to the Winds: But 12 Miles from this
<PB N="267" REF="136"/> Port, there is another, large, commodious, and safe. This Island abounds with Fowl, but yields but little Corn, Wine and Oyl, so that Provisions are here extraordinary dear. Here are many Villages, but of little or no considera∣tion. There are also some Monasteries of <HI>Hiero-Monachi,</HI> and <HI>Caloyers.</HI> Amongst the others, there is one Built upon a ve∣ry high steep Rock, on the right side, and pretty near the Fortress, for which the Inhabitants have a great Veneration, by the perswasion they have, that St. <HI>John</HI> began there his Book of <HI>Revelations.</HI> This Island is also famous in the Fa∣bles of the Ancients, for being either the Birth-place, or the Residence of <HI>Venus</HI> during her Youth; to whom they had De∣dicated a Temple in the Eastern part of the Island, under the Name of <HI>Citherea.</HI> This Island is subject to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who send thither every other Year one of their Nobles, with the Title of <HI>Castellain,</HI> and Proveditor.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Candia,</HI> anciently called <HI>Crete,</HI> is an Island and Kingdom situated at the entry of the Archi∣pelago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> stretching from East to West one side towards <HI>Asia,</HI> and the other towards <HI>Africa.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent.</NOTE> It's greatest length is from <HI>Cape Salomon</HI> to <HI>Cape Cor∣nico.</HI></P>

It's assured that towards the Sources of the Brook called <HI>Lene,</HI> which is to the North of <HI>Mount-Ida;</HI> there is a Grotto wrought into a Rock, which is said to be the Laby∣rinth of <HI>Minos,</HI> made according to <HI>Dedalus</HI>'s Directions. Its Inhabitants of this Island were the first that made them∣selves powerful at Sea by <HI>Navigation,</HI> and on Land by the use of Arrows. The sides their Experience at Sea, they taught the way of taming and managing Horses; they first of all in∣vented Musick, and were also the first that recorded their Laws. Yet they have always had the Repute of being Vicious, Lyars, and Pyrates.</P>
<PB N="268" REF="137"/>
<P>This Island was very famous for the Labyrinth of <HI>Minos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> Invented by <HI>Dedalus,</HI> and for the Ship called the <HI>Bull,</HI> wherein <HI>Europa</HI> was carried away; for the Amours of <HI>Pasiphae,</HI> and by the Birth of <HI>Jupiter</HI> to whom this Island was Consecrated. The Ancients reckoned above 100 Towns in it, and called it <HI>Hecatompolis.</HI> The <HI>La∣cedemonians</HI> took <HI>Candia,</HI> in <HI>Darius</HI>'s Name, in the 422 Year of <HI>Rome;</HI> but <HI>L. Celius Metellus</HI> Consul of <HI>Rome</HI> made him∣self Master of it in 686 of <HI>Rom.</HI> Afterwards this Island was Subject to the Emperors of <HI>Rome,</HI> and those of <HI>Constantinople</HI> until 823. that it was taken by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who Built the Town of <HI>Candia,</HI> that gave its Name to the Island. <HI>Nice∣phorus Phocas</HI> retook it in 962. <HI>Boniface,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Mont∣ferrat</HI> was Master of it, and after <HI>Constantinople</HI> was taken by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Venetians,</HI> he sold it to the latter in 1204. The <HI>Venetians</HI> fortified this Island in some places to curb the Inhabitants which were very subject to Rebel; for in 1364. they had a mind to bring in the <HI>Genoeses,</HI> but they were di∣verted by the wise Politicks of the Republick. The <HI>Turks</HI> un∣der pretence of Besieging <HI>Maltha</HI> in 1645. to be Revenged for the great Prize that the Knights under the Command of <HI>Bois-Baudran</HI> had taken in 1644. with a <HI>Sultan</HI> and an <HI>Otto∣man</HI> Prince, fell into <HI>Candia,</HI> where they continued the War until 1669. They made themselves Masters of <HI>Canea</HI> in 1645. and then laid Siege to the Town of <HI>Candia,</HI> which notwithstanding the endeavours of the <HI>French</HI> to rescue it from the Hands of the Infidels, after a desperate War of 24 Years was forced to yield to the <HI>Turks,</HI> but made honour∣able Conditions. After the taking of this Important Place, the <HI>Turks</HI> made themselves Masters of the greatest part of the Island, which they have kept ever since. The Chief For∣tresses which were left to the <HI>Venetians</HI> by their last Treaty with the Port, are <HI>Grabusa,</HI> the <HI>Suda,</HI> and <HI>Spina Longa.</HI> As for their Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> the <HI>Venetians</HI> are <HI>Roman Ca∣tholicks,</HI> but the other Inhabitants of the Island are of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Article III.</HI> Islands in the <HI>Mare Egeo,</HI> or <HI>Archipelago.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are in this Sea a great many Islands, of which there are but three worth taking notice of, <HI>viz. Egena, Culu∣ri,</HI> and <HI>Negropont.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>Egena.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Egena,</HI> lyes about 15 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles from the Sea-coast of <HI>Athens,</HI> 10 of <HI>Culuri,</HI> and 12 of <HI>Morea.</HI> It is called <HI>Egina</HI> by <HI>Strabo, Aenone</HI> by <HI>Baudrand, Myrmidonia</HI> by <HI>Brietius,</HI> and <HI>Engi</HI> by the Mariners. It is 30 Miles in Compass, but has no Harbour for Ships. Partridges multiply here to that degree that the Inhabitants are used to search their Nests, and de∣stroy their Eggs in the Spring, to prevent the prejudice so great a quantity of Fowl might cause to their Seeds.</P>
<P>There are here two fine Monuments of Antiquity; the first is a Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> towards the North of the Island; the second is another Temple Dedicated to <HI>Jupiter</HI> by <HI>Aeacus</HI> first King of this Island.</P>
<P>The Town which bears the Name of the Island, was for∣merly dignify'd with the Title of a Bishoprick Suffragan of the Archbishop of <HI>Athens,</HI> and famous for the Birth of <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Medicis;</HI> but it is now reduced to a Miserable Borough joined to the Fortress, which is only remarkable for the Advantages of its situation, upon a high craggy Rock, which over-looks several Islands of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>This Island was formerly subject to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but since the time that <HI>Frederick Barberossa</HI> took it from them, it was become a Receptacle of Banditto's and Pyrates. In 1674. <HI>Morosini</HI> forced them to Surrender at Discretion, and having pillag'd and demolished the Town, he caused 300 <HI>Greeks,</HI> and 40 <HI>Turks</HI> to be Chain'd in order to Row upon the Gal∣lies of the Republick of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<PB N="271" REF="138"/>
<P>II. <HI>Culuri.</HI></P>
<P>This Island was called by the Ancients <HI>Salamis,</HI> and is known to the Mariners under the Name of <HI>Santa Bursia,</HI> and under that of <HI>Cychria, Scyrar,</HI> and <HI>Pityussa</HI> to <HI>Baudrand.</HI> It has a Village which bears its Name, seated on the most Sou∣thern part of this Island, with about 200 Houses in it, and an Harbour, which according to Mr. <HI>Spon</HI>'s Travels, is one of the largest in the World, being Seven Miles long, and Two broad. This Island lyes about 10 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles from <HI>Egena,</HI> 2 from <HI>Attica,</HI> and is about 35 in Compass. It has about a Thousand Inhabitants; and abounds with Corn, Rosin, Pit∣coal, and Spunges, which the Inhabitants Transport to <HI>A∣thens.</HI> Over-against the Coast of <HI>Athens,</HI> there is a small Bo∣rough of 20 Houses, called <HI>Ambelachi,</HI> with a little Harbour; four or five Miles from this Village, was the Ancient City of <HI>Salimene,</HI> a Bishop's See under the Archbishop of <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Negropont.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Negropont,</HI> is an Island of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> separated from <HI>Achaia</HI> by <HI>Euripus.</HI> It was of old called <HI>Eubaea</HI> and <HI>Chalcis;</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Egribos,</HI> and the Inhabitants <HI>Egripos.</HI> Some Authors tell us, that this Island formerly was part of <HI>Baeotia,</HI> a Province of <HI>Achaia,</HI> from whence it was separated by an Earthquake. It is 365 Miles in Compass, 90 in length from S. to N. and 40 in breadth. Its two most noted Capes are <HI>Cabo Figera,</HI> or <HI>Cabo d'Oro,</HI> (formerly called <HI>Caphareus</HI>) and <HI>Cabo Lithar.</HI></P>
<P>This Island is very fruitful, and abounds in all Provisions. There is the Mountain of <HI>Caristo,</HI> famous for its excellent Marble, and the Stone <HI>Amiantos</HI> or <HI>Asbestos,</HI> whereof they make a kind of Linnen, which is made clean by casting it in∣to the Fire, as being incombustible. This Island produces Cotton enough to furnish Sails for a whole Fleet. There are two Rivers in it, <HI>Similio</HI> and <HI>Cereo;</HI> the first of which makes the Fleeces of the Sheep white, and the other makes them black, if the Poets may be credited.</P>
<P>The Governour of this Isle is now a Captain <HI>Bassa,</HI> who has the Command also of <HI>Achaia.</HI> During the Government of
<PB N="272" REF="139"/> Doge <HI>Pietro Ziani,</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Constantinople</HI> bestowed this Island upon the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> but they lost it in 1469.</P>
<P>The Capital City has the same Name with the Isle, and is sometimes called <HI>Euripont</HI> from <HI>Euripus,</HI> on whose Banks it is seated, towards the Continent of <HI>Achaia,</HI> 45 N. of <HI>Setines,</HI> 130 almost S. E. of <HI>Larissa,</HI> and 380 S. W. of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Long. 48 d. 25 m. Lat. 38 d. 20 m. It is joined to <HI>A∣chaia</HI> by a Draw-bridge, which leads to a great Tower, for∣merly Built by the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the <HI>Euripus,</HI> from whence they pass to the Continent by a Stone-bridge of five little Arches. This City is about two Miles in compass, but the Suburbs, which are Inhabited by <HI>Greek</HI> Christians, are more populous than the City, where none but <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> dwell. All the Inhabitants are said to amount to the number of 15000, of which 10000 are Christians. There are four Mosques, one whereof was formerly the Cathedral Church Dedicated to St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and was under the Archbishop of <HI>Athens.</HI> The <HI>Jesuits</HI> have a House in the Suburbs where they teach Youth. The <HI>Turks</HI> Attack'd this Place in <HI>June</HI> 1469. with a Fleet of 300 Sail, and an Army of 120000 Men, <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. being present; the Besieged over-powered by numbers, were fain to give way after a Gallant Defence. The Proveditor <HI>Erizzo,</HI> upon the <HI>Turks</HI> entring the City, retrenched himself, and did not Surrender till the <HI>Sultan</HI> had promised him his Life, but he broke his Promise, and caused him to be Sawed through in the midst. He had a Daughter called <HI>Anne,</HI> who beeause of her Beauty was presented to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but she disdaining his Caresses, incensed him to that degree that he cut off her Head with his own Hand. Afterwards the <HI>Turks</HI> exer∣cised all manner of Cruelties upon the Garrison, and the In∣habitants of the City, putting all to the Sword above 20 Years old. In 1688. the <HI>Venetians</HI> Besieged this City with 24000 Men, and Storm'd it twice, but without Success.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of <HI>Euripus.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>EƲripus,</HI> is an Arm of the Sea, between <HI>Achaia</HI> and <HI>Ne∣gropont,</HI> so narrow just over-against the Capital City of the Island, that a single Galley can hardly pass between the
<PB N="239" REF="139"/> Cittadel and Tower of the <HI>Venetians:</HI> The Ancients called it <HI>Euripus Euboicus,</HI> the Natives call it <HI>Egripos,</HI> and the <HI>Italians, Stretto di Negroponte.</HI> This Channel has its Ebbs and Flows, like the Ocean, but still with some particular Differences. <HI>Aristotle</HI> was so puzzled to find out the Reason of the Flux and Reflux of the <HI>Euripus,</HI> that he is said to have cast him∣self headlong into it; tho' others affirm that he Poyson'd him∣self, and others still that he died of a Cholick.</P>
