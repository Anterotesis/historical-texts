<HEAD>Sir Francis Drake REVIVED, Giving an Account of his Sur∣prizing of <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and of several other nota∣ble Atchievements perform∣ed by him in those Parts.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Whitsun-Eve,</HI> May 24. 1572. Captain <HI>Drake</HI> in the <HI>Pascha</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> of 70. Tuns, his Ad∣miral, with the <HI>Swan</HI> of the said Port of 25 Tuns, his Vice-Admiral in which his Brother <HI>John Drake</HI> was Captain, set sail, having in both of them of Men and Boys 73. sufficiently provided with Necessaries for such a Voyage.</P>
<P>The Wind continuing at N. E. gave us very good Passage, so that in five Weeks after, we had sight of the Island of <HI>Guada∣lupe,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
one of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> Islands. The next Morning <HI>June</HI> 29th. entring between <HI>Do∣minica</HI> and <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> we descried 2 Canows coming from a rocky Island 3 Leagues off <HI>Dominica.</HI> Landing on the South side of it, we remained three days there to refresh our men, and to water our Ships. There we saw some poor Cottages built with <HI>Palmito</HI> Boughs and Branches, but no Inhabitants; the Cottages (probably) serving only for the use of those that came thither at certain times to fish.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1. being the <HI>3d.</HI> day after, about 3 in the Afternoon wé sailed thence for the Con∣tinent of <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and the fifth day we saw the high land of <HI>Sancta Martha;</HI> but we directed our Course for a Place, called by our Captain in his former Voyage, <HI>Port Phesant,</HI> by reason of the great store of those Fowls, he and his Company had there, where we arrived in six days. It is a round Bay, and safe Harbour, not past half a Cables length over at the mouth, but within 8, or 10 every way, of 10, or 12 fathom water, full of good Fish, and of a fruitful soil.</P>
<P>At our entrance here, our Captain having left his Brother to attend the Ships, with some few of his Company went to land. But as we were rowing ashore, we saw a Smoke in the Woods near the place our Captain fre∣quented;
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
therefore our Captain thought fit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take more strength with us, suspecting some Enemy there. But this smoke was oc∣casioned by a Fire, which one Mr. <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> and his Company had made, and had continued at least five days before our Arrival. This <HI>John Garret</HI> left a Plate of Lead nailed to a huge Tree of near five Fa∣thom about, in which were Engraven these words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Drake, <HI>if you fortune to come to this Port, make haste away; for the</HI> Spaniards <HI>which you had with you here the last year, have bewrayed this place, and taken away all that you left here. I departed from hence this present</HI> 7th. <HI>of</HI> July, 1572.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very loving Friend,
John Garret.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Yet our Captain Resolved to tarry here still he had built his <HI>Pinnaces;</HI> and therefore caused the <HI>Pinnaces</HI> to be brought ashore for the Carpenters to set up, employing the rest of his Company in fortifying a place he had chosen out to work in, being 3 Rudes, which he did, with Trees, thirty foot in height, round, leaving only one Gate to issue at, near the Water-side, which was every night shut up with a Tree drawn cross it. The Plat
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
was of a <HI>Pentagonal</HI> form; two Angles were towards the Sea, and that side between them left open for launching our <HI>Pinnaces;</HI> the other four sides were firmly closed up. With∣out the ground was rid fifty foot round. The rest was very thick with Trees, of which many were of those kinds, that are never without green leaves, till they are dead at the Root, (but there is one kind among them like our Ash, which when the Sun is vertical to them, and causeth great Rains, casts all its leaves in three days, and in six days again becomes all green) of a prodigious height, supported with six Buttresses growing out of their Body, in each of which three men may be so hid, that they who stand in the next Buttress shall not see them. The Wood of those Trees is as heavy as Brasil, or <HI>Lignum Vitae,</HI> and is of a white Colour.</P>
<P>The day after our arrival, there came an <HI>English</HI> Bark of the Isle of <HI>Wight, James Rawse</HI> Captain, and <HI>John Overy</HI> Master, with thirty men. They brought in with them a <HI>Spanish</HI> Carvel of <HI>Sivel</HI> (taken the day before) and a Shallop taken at <HI>Cape Blanch.</HI> This Captain was desirous to joyn with ours, and was received accordingly.</P>
<P>July 20. Seven days after his coming, ha∣ving dispatched our Business, we departed from that Harbour towards <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
within three days we arrived at the Isles of <HI>Pinos,</HI> and found two Frigates of <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> lading Timber thence.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Negroes</HI> in these Frigats we were in∣formed of the State of the Town, and of a Report, that certain Soldiers were daily ex∣pected from the Governour of <HI>Panama</HI> for the defence of the Town against the <HI>Symerons</HI> (a black People, who fled from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> their Masters, by reason of their Cruelty, and since grown into two Kingdoms, the one to the East, the other to the West of the way from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to <HI>Panama.)</HI></P>
<P>Our Captain set those <HI>Negroes</HI> ashore, that they might joyn themselves to their Countrey∣men, the <HI>Symerons,</HI> or at least that he might prevent their going to alarm the Town with News of his Arrival, <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> being far distant from that place by land; and him∣self resolved to go thither with all speed and secrecy.</P>
<P>And so disposing of his Companies, ac∣cording as they inclined, he left the three Ships and Carvel with Captain <HI>Rawse,</HI> and chose into his four Pinnaces, fifty three of our men, and twenty of Captain <HI>Rawses,</HI> well armed.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28. Thus parted from our Compa∣ny, we arrived at the Island of <HI>Cativaas,</HI> being twenty five Leagues distant, <HI>Aug.</HI> 2. where
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
our Captain trained his men, delivering to each their several Arms, encouraging them with certain hopes of success.</P>
<P>The same day we sailed for <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI> Before Sun-set we reached <HI>Rio Francisco.</HI> Thence he led us hard aboard the shore (that we might not be descried) to within two Leagues of the Point of the Bay, where we rode till it was dark.</P>
<P>When our Captain, finding those of our Company proposing difficulties, resolved to take the opportunity that Night; and so we arrived there at three of the Clock after mid∣night. About the same time a Ship of <HI>Spain</HI> had arrived there, who suspecting us, sent her Gundeloe to alarm the Town, which our Captain perceiving, prevented, so that we landed without any difficulty, and seized up∣on six Pieces of Ordnance, the Gunner ha∣ving fled, whereby the Town was alarm'd.</P>
<P>Our Captain left twelve men to keep the Pinnaces, that we might safely retreat in case of danger, and securing the Platform, he thought it best to view the Mount on East side the Town, fearing lest there might be Ord∣nance planted there, whence we might be annoyed; but seeing no fear of Danger thence we returned to the City, where we parted; <HI>John Oxnam</HI> and 16 of his men going about behind the Kings Treasure house, entred the
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
East end of the Market, and our Captain by the broad Street passed to the Market place with sound of Drum and Trumpet. The Fire∣pikes were equally divided betwixt them, and proved no less advantageous to our men than frightful to the Enemy.</P>
<P>Yet the Inhabitants had put themselves in Arms, and drew up their Companies in some order at the South-east end of the Market place. And to make a shew of far greater numbers of shot, they had hung lines with Matches lighted athwart the West end of the Market place, between the Church and the Cross, but perceiving their Stratagem by us discovered, they fled.</P>
<P>But the Soldiers presented us with a volly of shot, levelling so low, that their Bullets oft times grazed the Sands: And we having once fired upon them, and feathered them with our Arrows (made on purpose) came to push of Pike, when our fire-Pikes did us great ser∣vice, where our men some with their Pikes, and some with the butt-end of their Muskets so annoyed the Enemy, that they threw down their Arms to provide for their safety by flight.</P>
<P>In the Chase several of our men were hurt with the Arms which the Enemies had let fall as they fled, which caused us to desist the pur∣suite; so we returned to the midst of the Mar∣ket place.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Our Captain having taken 2, or 3 <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> commanded them to shew the Gover∣nours house where the Treasure was kept. At our coming thither, the great door (where the Moyls usually unlade) was open, a Can∣dle lighted on the top of the stairs, and a Gen∣net ready sadled: By means of this light we saw a huge heap of Silver, being a pile of Bars about 70 foot in length, 10 in breadth, and 12 in heighth; but our Captain forbid any to touch it, but to stand on our Guard.</P>
<P>There was in the Kings Treasure near the Water-side, more Gold and Jewels than all our four Pinnaces could carry.</P>
<P>When we were returned to our strength, we were alarm'd with news, that our Pinnaces were in danger to be taken, and that if we got not quickly aboard, we would be overpower∣ed with Multitudes of Soldiers and Towns People. Our Captain therefore sent his Brother and <HI>John Oxnam</HI> to search out the Truth of it, who found our men in the Pinnaces much frighted, by reason of great Companies they saw running up and down, some with Matches lighted, some with other Weapons from the out-parts of the Town, who came often near us, and, firing, retreated.</P>
<P>Presently after there fell a mighty shower of Rain with Thunder and Lightning, so that before we could recover a shelter, some of
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
our Bow-strings were wet, and some of our Match and Powder dammaged; which while we were refurnishing, several of our men were muttering on the foresaid Reports of the strength of the Town; whereupon our Cap∣tain told them, he had brought them to the Mouth of the Treasure of the World, if they would want it, blame themselves only; and therefore when the storm was over, unwilling to give his men longer leisure to demur, or the Enemy further respite, he stept forward, com∣manding his Brother with <HI>John Oxnam</HI> and their Company to break the Kings Treasure∣house, the rest to follow himself to keep the strength of the Market place, till they had dis∣patch'd their Business.</P>
<P>But as he stept forward, he began to faint through much effusion of Blood out of a wound in his Leg, he received in the first encounter, which though it smarted, he con∣cealed, till his fainting discovered it, the Blood having filled the prints our footsteps made, to the great dismay of all our Company, thinking it incredible, that one man should lose so much Blood, and live.</P>
<P>And therefore tho' they would have hazarded much for such a Booty, yet would they not endanger their Captains life, but having gi∣ven him some Cordial, and tied up his Leg, they entreated him to go aboard, that his
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
wound might be drest, and then return ashore, if he thought fit.</P>
<P>This, when they could not perswade him to (as knowing, that if they went aboard, they could never recover that state again, in which they now were, and thinking it more honoura∣ble to jeopard his life for so great a Prize, than to leave such an Enterprize unaccomplished) they with force and entreaty carryed him a∣board his Pinnace, abandoning a Rich Spoil to preserve their Captains Life.</P>
<P>Thus we embarkt, <HI>July</HI> 29 by break of day; many of our men besides our Captain were wounded, only a Trumpeter slain; where∣upon our Chirurgions were busie in dressing their Wounds, but especially our Captains. And before we departed the Harbour, we took the aforesaid Ship of Wines belonging to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But before we had her free of the Haven, they of the Town shot at us. But notwithstanding we carried our Prize to the Isle <HI>Bastimienses,</HI> or the Isle of <HI>Victuals,</HI> where we staid two days to cure our wounded men, and refresh our selves.</P>
<P>At our arrival here, the Governour sent to our Captain a Principal Soldier of the late sent Garrison, to view us, who at his coming pro∣tested he came of meer good Will, for that we had undertaken so great an attempt with so few men; and that at first they feared we
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
had been <HI>French,</HI> of whom they expected no mercy, but perceiving us to be <HI>English,</HI> their fears were the less, knowing, that tho' we took the Treasure, yet we would use no Cru∣elty towards their persons.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this fair pretence, his Governour had sent him aboard, by reason divers of the Town had affirmed they knew our Captain, who had been often on their Coast last two years; he desired to know, 1. Whether our Captain was the same Cap∣tain <HI>Drake</HI> or no? 2. Whether our Arrows, which many of their men were wounded with, were poisoned? And 3. how they might be cured? Lastly, what Victuals or Necessaries we wanted, promising to supply us. Our Captain, though suspecting him a Spie, yet answered his demands; That he was the same Captain <HI>Drake,</HI> that it was not his manner to poison Arrows, and that the Wounds might be cured by ordinary Chirurgery; as for Wants, he told him, He wanted nothing, but some of that special Commodity that Country yielded, and therefore before he departed he meant to reap some of their Harvest they got out of the Earth.</P>
<P>To this the Gentleman replied, What then was the Reason we departed the Town at this time, where there is above 360 Tun of Silver ready for the Fleet, and a greater
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
value of Gold; but when our Captain had declared the cause, he acknowledged our wisdom in departing, was no less than our courage in attempting.</P>
<P>Thus with courteous entertainment, after Dinner, he was dismissed in such sort that he protested he was never so much Honored in his life.</P>
<P>After his departure, the <HI>Negroe</HI> afore∣mentioned confirmed his report of Gold and Silver, and told us how we might acquire store of it by means of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> whom though he had very much incensed, yet if our Captain would undertake his Protection, he durst hazard his life, as knowing our Captains name was most precious among them.</P>
<P>Whereupon we further consulted, and because this place seemed not safe, next day we Sailed for <HI>Port-Plentie</HI> where we had left our Ships and recovered it next night.</P>
<P>At our return to our Ships, Captain <HI>Rause</HI> doubting of our safe continuance upon that Coast, departed: our Captain in the mean time having put all things in readiness resol∣ved with his 2 Ships and 3 Pinnaces to go to <HI>Carthagene.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 13 We came to an Anchor in 3 Fathom Water, between the Islands of <HI>Cha∣resha</HI> and St. <HI>Bernards.</HI> Our Captain led
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
the Pinnaces about the Island into the Har∣bour of <HI>Carthagene;</HI> where he found a Fri∣gate at Anchor, &amp; one man only aboard, who being askt for the rest of his company, told they were gone ashore that evening; that 2 hours before night there past by a Pinnace making all speed they could, and askt him if any <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French</HI> had been there late∣ly, and upon Answer that none had been, they bid them look to themselves: that after this Pinnace was come to the out-parts of <HI>Carthagene</HI> many great Pieces were shot off; whereupon one going to the Topmast espied over the Land diverse Frigates bringing themselves within the Castle.</P>
<P>This report our Captain credited; and having further examined this old Mariner, he understood that there was within the next Point a great Ship of <HI>Sivel</HI> ready to Sail next morning for <HI>Domingo,</HI> and taking this old man into the Pinnace he rowed towards this Ship, which we boarded. As soon as we were on the Decks we threw down the Gates and Spare-decks to prevent the dan∣ger of closs Fight; and then we cut her Cables, and towed her with our three Pin∣naces without the Island, without danger of their great shot.</P>
<P>Which when the Town heard of, they put themselves into readiness, and came
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
down to the very point of the Wood, a∣gainst us.</P>
<P>The next morning we took two Frigats, in which were two of the Kings <HI>Scrivano's</HI> with 7 Mariners and 2 <HI>Negroes,</HI> come from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and bound for <HI>Carthagene,</HI> to certifie them of our aforementioned ex∣ploit at <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI> Yet our Captain at the <HI>Scrivano's</HI> entreaties set all the Com∣pany a shore, and then bare up to the Island of St. <HI>Bernards,</HI> three Leagues off the Town.</P>
<P>Our Captain now considering that he was discovered, found that he must wait some time before he could accomplish his design, and likewise that his Pinnaces must be well mann'd; in order to which he had a design to burn one of the Ships and make the other a Storehouse; but finding that his Company would be loth of that, he thought of ano∣ther expedient; and therefore sent for <HI>Tho∣mas Moon</HI> (Carpenter in the <HI>Swan)</HI> and de∣sired him to bore several holes in the Well of that Ship as near the Keel as he could, and that with all secresie. He was very averse from doing it, but having heard our Cap∣tains reasons, he was at last perswaded, and did it accordingly.</P>
<P>The next morning our Captain designed to go a Fishing, and going aboard the <HI>Swan</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
he desired his Brother to go with him, who desired him to stay alittle and he would immediately attend him. Our Captain per∣ceiving the Carpenter had fulfilled his de∣sire, demanded of them why their Bark was so deep? Whereupon his Brother sent one down to the Steward to know what was the matter; who going down immediately alarum'd them with news that the Ship was full of Water. Whereupon all hands were set to work, but all in vain; Our Captain consulting with them about it, found, that despairing of saving her they referred to him what should be done: And therefore he proposed to them that he would go into the Pinnace till such time as a Frigate were provided, and that his Brother should be Captain in the Admiral, and the Master should be also there with him instead of this; which seeing she could not be saved he would have fired that the Enemy might not have her, but first that every one should take out of her what they lacked or liked. This was put in execution that night, and so our Captain had his desire, having now men enough for his Pinnaces.</P>
<P>The next day we resolved to seek out a fit place in the Sound of <HI>Dorienne</HI> where we might leave our Ship at Anchor undis∣covered by the Enemy: that so the Enemy
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
imagining us departed we might better fol∣low our purposes with our Pinnaces.</P>
<P>And accordingly we departed for the said Sound, and in 5 days reached it, where we stayed 15 days, keeping very close, that our Enemies might think we were departed.</P>
<P>Here we were not Idle, but besides our trimming and fitting our Pinnaces, he cau∣sed us rid a Plat of Ground to build us Houses for our Lodging, wherein the <HI>Negroe</HI> was serviceable to us. As also at spare times we had several sorts of recreations as every man fancied.</P>
<P>After the fifteen days expired, our Cap∣tain leaving the Ship with his Brother took 2 Pinnaces for <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and passing by <HI>Carthagene,</HI> when we were within 2 Lea∣gues of the River we Landed to the West∣wards on the Main. Where seeing some <HI>In∣dians,</HI> they asked us what we would have? and knowing we desired fresh Victuals they brought us some; for which courtesie our Captain sufficiently rewarded them.</P>
<P>Thence we departed to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where we entred at 3 in the Afternoon. From thence till night we rowed up the stream, making but small progress. We moared our Pinnaces to a Tree that night, by reason of a huge shower of Rain with Terrible Claps of Thunder, (which is usual there
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>
and continues about three quarters of an hour) after which it was very calm, and then we were infested with Flies called <HI>Mushitos</HI> (like our Gnats) which bite spite∣fully; our best remedy against them was Juice of Lemons.</P>
<P>At Break of day we departed up the River; where we espied a Canow with 2 <HI>Indians</HI> fishing in the River, but we spoke not to them for being descried, nor they to us, think∣ing us <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Afterwards we espied cer∣tain houses on the other side the River. And a <HI>Spaniard</HI> which kept those houses thinking us his Country men, made a Smoke, for a sign to us to turn that way, but when we drew near him, he saw his mistake, and so fled from his houses, which were 5 in num∣ber full of white Rusk, Bacon with several other Provisions, to serve the Fleet return∣ing to Spain. With store of this we loaded our Pinnaces, and hastned our departure, by reason of intelligence we had of certain <HI>In∣dians,</HI> that the Frigats (30 in number which usually transport Merchandise out of <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> &amp; thence to these houses, and so in <HI>Canows</HI> up to <HI>Nueva Reyno,</HI> and return in Exchange, Gold Treasure and Commodi∣ties of that Kingdom) were not returned from <HI>Cartagena</HI> since the first report of our being there.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="13"/>
<HI>Sep.</HI> 10. As we returned to our Pin∣naces the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sent down the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Villa del Rey,</HI> with Bows and Arrows against us, but we rowed down the Stream, one League, and Anchored till the morning, then we got to the Mouth of the River, where we unladed our Provisions, cleansed our Pinnaces, and took it in again, and then went Westward.</P>
<P><HI>Sep.</HI> 11. Between <HI>Cartagena</HI> and <HI>Tolou</HI> we took 5 or 6 Frigats laden with Victuals; we set the Men at liberty, having heard all we could of 'em, keeping only two of the Frigats well stored with Victuals.</P>
<P>Three days after, we arrived at <HI>Port-plen∣ty,</HI> where we built 4 Store-houses, to keep our Provision in, several Leagues asunder, that if the Enemy should surprize any one, we might be furnished by another, our <HI>Negroes</HI> being very useful to us in this Work.</P>
<P>At this time Captain <HI>John Drake</HI> fortu∣nately found out the <HI>Symerons</HI> as he rowed aloaf the Shore, by the direction of our a∣foresaid <HI>Negroe, Diego,</HI> who calling to the <HI>Symerons,</HI> dealt so effectually with them that he gave and received two men, as pledges of Fidelity, appointing a meeting next day at a River, midway, between the <HI>Cabezas</HI> and our Ships, called <HI>Rio Diego.</HI></P>
<P>These two being well qualified men, did
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
with all reverence, declare to our Captain their great joy conceived by his arrival, as knowing him to be an Enemy to the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> and therefore were ready to assist him against their Enemies to the utmost: and that their captain did then stay at the mouth of <HI>Rio Diego</HI> to attend his pleasure, and that they would have come by Land to this place, but that the way is very troublesome, by reason of steep Mountains, deep Rivers and thick Brakes; desiring therefore our Captain would take order about it: Our Captain weighing their Speech with former Intelligence, and comparing it with their great kindness towards his Brother; resol∣ved with his Brother and the two <HI>Symerons,</HI> in his two Pinnaces, to go towards the River, which he did that night; ordering the rest of their company to follow them next mor∣ning, because there was a place of great safe∣ty. The safety of it consisted not only that it was a fruitful Countrey, and that no <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> were there, but especially that it ly∣eth among a great many goodly Islands full of Trees, where, though there be Channels, yet there are such Rocks and Shoals that no man can enter by night, nor by day without discovery: whereas our Ship might lye hid∣den within the Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Sep.</HI> 14. The next day we met with them
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
at the aforesaid place, the rest being at a miles distance. After we had entertained them, and received testimonies of their good will, we took 2 more of them into our Pin∣naces, leaving our 2 men with them, ap∣pointing a meeting with them and some more at the River <HI>Guana.</HI> So we departed to∣wards our Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 16. Two days after we found her, being much damnified by tempest. And ha∣ving repaired her, <HI>Sept.</HI> 18. Our Captain sent a Pinnace towards the bottom of the Bay, to found out the Channel, for the bringing her in, and the next day got her safe into the best Channel; it was 5 miles distant from the <HI>Cativaas</HI> betwixt the Island and the Main, being very narrow, and full of bushes. We had scarce setled there when our 2 men with the Troup of <HI>Symerons</HI> came in sight of our Ship, whom we brought aboard.</P>
<P>Our Captain desiring they would put him in a way to procure Gold, they told him if they had known of it before, they could have given him store of it (as having taken a great quantity from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> which they sunk into the River) which now they could not do, because the Rivers in which it was thrown were very high, and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in these rainy months use not to carry their Treasure
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>
by Land. This answer satisfied us of their honest meaning towards us. Therefore our Captain resolved for these 5 months to stay a Shore, and so <HI>Sept.</HI> 24. we built houses for our aboad that time, and a Fort Triangle wise, 13 foot high. But after 14 days repose here, our Captain purposing to go to <HI>Cartagena</HI> with 3 Pinnaces, left his Brother to govern those left behind with the <HI>Symerons</HI> to finish the Fort begun.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 7. Thus we set Sail and came that night to an Island (which he called <HI>Spurkite,</HI> from great store of Birds in that shape.) The next day we were clear of these I∣slands, and about 4 days after, near the I∣sland of St. <HI>Bernards</HI> we chased 2 Frigates ashore, and recovering one of the Islands we stayed there 2 days to wash our Pinnaces and catch Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 16. Thence we went towards <HI>Tolou</HI> and landed in a Garden where certain <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> delivered us their Bows and Arrows and gave us such fruit, as the place yielded, for which we requited them. Our Captains de∣sign in taking those places was to learn the true state of the Country and the Fleets.</P>
<P>Thence we went towards <HI>Charesha</HI> the Island of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> where we let fall our Grappers betwixt the Island and the Main over against the goodly Garden Island. Our
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>
Captain, would not suffer us to land there, knowing it would have proved dangerous; and within 3 hours after, passing by the Point of the Island, we had a volly of 100 shot from them; and yet but one of our men was hurt.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 17. This evening we departed to Sea, and the next morning we took a Bark, which we easily boarded, for that the Cap∣tain with most of the Passengers had gone a∣shore. She had in her great store of Sope and Sweet-meats bound from St. <HI>Domingo</HI> to <HI>Cartagena. Oct.</HI> 18. The next day we set all the men ashore (save a young <HI>Negroe</HI> we kept) but kept the Bark, and in her bare to the mouth of <HI>Cartagena</HI> Harbor, and An∣chored.</P>
<P>That, Afternoon some Horsemen came down with the <HI>Scrivano</HI> aforementioned to the point, and held up a Truce Flag, desiring safe conduct to our Ship; which granted the <HI>Scrivano</HI> came a board, and thanking our Captain for former courtesies, he promised that night to procure us store of Victuals, whatever displeasure he might incur thereby. But we found this only a device of the Go∣vernor's to delay time till they were of suf∣ficient strength to entrap us; and therefore we put to Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 20. The next day in the Afternoon we took 2 Frigates come from <HI>Cartagena,</HI> the
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>
one of 50 the other of 12 Tuns, having only ballast in them; we kept the Frigats but set the men ashore in the great Frigats Gun∣delow.</P>
<P>The next morning they came down to the Wester Point with a Truce Flag; &amp; our Cap∣tain manned one Pinnace and rowed ashore; when we were near the shore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fled into the Wood as afraid of us, but in∣deed 'twas only to draw us on; as we reach∣ed the Land our Captain leaped ashore in their sight, but made no stay; when he was come aboard again, we haled off and rode a while; They came forth again, and sent a youth to demand what was our intent to stay thus upon the Coast? Our Captain answered, for Traffick; he sent him again to shew him that 'twas prohibit, to Traffick with Foreign People for any thing except Powder. He answered he was come to exchange his com∣modities for Gold and Silver and was purpo∣sed to effect it. However he gave this Mes∣senger a Shirt for his reward.</P>
<P>We heard no answer all that day but kept in our Frigats, keeping good watch all night. The next morning the wind turned Easterly, and we-saw two Sails (which were sent from <HI>Cartagena</HI> to fight us) com∣ing to us; whereupon our Captain went to encounter them, and approaching them we
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>
saw many men aboard them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the Shore thought to recover their Frigats (being left unmanned) while we were bu∣sied with the other. But our Captain pre∣vented it, for leaving <HI>John Oxnam</HI> to treat those two Ships, he made speed to his Fri∣gats, and caused the <HI>Spaniards</HI> consult to save their lives by flight, leaving several of their weapons behind them. And seeing he could not man them, he burnt the one and sunk the other. This done he returned to <HI>John Oxnam</HI> (who all this while lay silent by the Men of War) and the wind blowing from Sea, we were forced to bear into the Har∣bor before them, they supposing we fled; but as soon as we felt smooth Water, getting the wind, we fought them at advantage, so that they were willing to press no nigher: and as they let fall their Anchors, we drop∣ed ours in the wind of them. They seeing no gain to be had of us retired to the Town; but we by reason of bad weather Rode there 4 days.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 27. A Frigat came from Sea, and seeing us, ran her self ashore, unhanging her Rudder and throwing away her Sails; when we were come up to her, a party came down to the point of the Main, whom we by our shot caused quickly retire into the Woods. Whereupon we went to Sea with intent to
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
ride at the Rock called <HI>Las Serenas</HI> 2 Leagues off, but through tempest were forced to return into the Harbor. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had a new device; for they sent forth a Party against us, who at our encountring them fled with intent to draw us after them, having an ambush set for us; besides, 2 Pinnaces well mann'd came towards us and attacqued us boldly; and seeing us bear from them, they concluded of Victory: But our Captain Commanding his other Pin∣nace to be brought a head of him, and to let fall their Grappers each a head the others, environed both the Pinnaces as for a close fight. We (as well as they) spent Powder apace, but had but one of out men wound∣ed; what they had we knew not, but their Pinnaces were shot through in diverse places and the Powder of one of them took fire; whereupon we bore towards them, which they seeing, betook themselves to their old Sanctuary.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 3. Thus seeing little hopes off suc∣cess in this place, our Captain thought it best to go Eastward towards <HI>Rio Grand</HI> to fur∣nish our selves with Victuals, being now scarce of them, and 2 days after we came to the Villages of store, where before we had furnished our selves sufficiently, but now found nothing, to our great grief; the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> having caused the People to fly to the
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>
Mountains, and driven away their Cattel that we might not be relieved; afterwards we saw a Frigate at Sea, and made quickly towards her, hoping to be relieved thence, but when we had boarded her we found she had neither Meat, nor Money.</P>
<P>Thus we endured scarcity for 7 or 8 days, bearing room for <HI>Santa Martha</HI> in hopes to find Shipping there, and finding none we Anchored under the Western point; which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having notice of, conveyed 30 or 40 shot among the Clifts, which so annoyed us that we were forced to be gone with all speed. Then we entred into con∣sultation what to do, the Company being for landing somewhere Eastward to get Victu∣als; But our Captain thought it better to bear towards <HI>Rio de Haca</HI> or <HI>Carizao.</HI></P>
<P>The Company of the other Pinnace an∣swered, that neither their Pinnaces could hold out, nor they themselves subsist with so slender provision. He answered they had more than he had, and therefore doubted not but they would trust providence. And so he hoysed his fore-Sail and set for <HI>Carizao,</HI> which they perceiving followed him.</P>
<P>As we had Sailed 3 Leagues we espied a Sail plying Westward, and so joyfully bare towards her; she, being a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship above 90 Tun, shot her Ordinance at us. We durst
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>
not attempt boarding her, it being Stormy, but attended her, and 2 hours after it being Calm, we boarded her, and furnished our selves sufficiently with Provision.</P>
<P>All things set in order, &amp; the Wind arising, we plyed off and on all night; when it was day the Captain sent <HI>Edward Hixom</HI> to search out a good Harbor, who having found one re∣turned, and we came in with our new Prize: Our Captain promising liberty and all their Apparel to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> if they would procure us fresh Water and Victuals, which they did; and towards the evening we came all aboard again leaving, our late Prisoners, the <HI>Span∣iards</HI> ashore according to our promise to their great joy, and so set Sail.</P>
<P>At this time a sickness raged among us, and <HI>Charles Club</HI> one of our Quarter-masters died of it to our great grief: we impured it to cold, men had taken lying in the Pinnaces. But however it pleased God, that all the rest of our Company recovered.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 15. Next morning our Captain com∣manded the <HI>Minion,</HI> his lesser Pinnace, to hasten before him toward his Ships at Fort <HI>Die∣go</HI> within the <HI>Cabeza</HI>'s, to acquaint them of his coming, and prepare all things for our Land Journey, if so be they heard any thing from the <HI>Symerons</HI> of the Fleets arrival.</P>
<P>When we came to our Ship we were sur∣prized
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>
to our great Grief, with the news o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Death of <HI>John Drake</HI> our Captains Bro∣ther and one <HI>Richard Allen,</HI> both slain in attempting to board a Frigate: The manne<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus: Having seen this Frigate at Sea, the Company were very importunate on him to set upon her; he told them he wanted wea∣pons to assail with, and knew not how strong the Frigate might be. But this not satisfying he told them that they should not through hi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cowardise lose any Prize. Thereupon every man shifted as they could, and emptyed thei<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Boats of the Planks (that were therein fo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carrying on their Fort,) they took such poo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Arms as they had, and so made towards the Frigate, and boarded her. But they found her Armed round about whith a close figh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Hides full of Pikes and Calivers which were discharged in their faces; of which there were several wounded, and <HI>John Drake</HI> and <HI>Richard Allen</HI> mortally; but notwithstand∣ing they got free of the Frigate and reco∣vered their Ship, where those 2 died.</P>
<P>Thus having moared our Ship our Cap∣tain resolved to lie hid, expecting to hear of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, and therefore supplied his Company with the <HI>Symerons</HI> out of his aforesaid Magazine, besides wild Beasts out of the Woods. After a Months Sail most of our men fell sick of a <HI>Calenture,</HI> and se∣veral
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
died, of whom <HI>Joseph Drake,</HI> another of our Captains Brothers, was one, whom for the discovering of the Nature of that dis∣ease, our Captain caused be opened by the Surgeon, who found his Liver swollen, his Heart as it were sodden and his Guts all fair. Within 4 days the Surgeon that cut him up died also, by reason of an over strong pur∣gation he had taken.</P>
<P>The <HI>Symerons</HI> during our absence ranged up and down the Country to learn what they could for us; now they bring us news that the Fleet was arrived at <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI> Our Captain sent the <HI>Lyon</HI> to descrie the truth thereof; who espying a Frigate, boarded and took herladen with <HI>Maiz,</HI> Hens and Pompions from <HI>Tolou.</HI> The men therein, who assured us of their arrival, our Captain used very cour∣teously, guarding them from the cruelty of the <HI>Symerons</HI> who were thirsting after their Blood.</P>
<P>And when he prepared for his Journey to <HI>Panama,</HI> he gave <HI>Ellis Hixom</HI> charge of his Ship and Company, and especially of those <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>All things thus ordered, our Captain con∣ferred with the <HI>Symerons</HI> about Provision for this Journey; they told him that great store of Shoes were necessary, by reason of the many Rivers with Stones and Gravel they were to pass. All things provided we took
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>
our Journey on <HI>Shrove Tuesday, Feb.</HI> 3. By this time 28 of our men had died, and a few healthy men were left aboard with <HI>Ellis,</HI> who had strict charge not to trust any Messenger that should come in our Captains name without his handwriting.</P>
<P>We were in all 48, 18 <HI>English,</HI> and the rest <HI>Symerons,</HI> who, besides their Arrows bore our Provision and Victuals, and be∣cause they could not carry enough, by the way they provided us store with their Arrows.</P>
<P>They have each 2 sorts of Arrows; the one to defend himself, and offend the Enemy; the other to kill his Victuals. These for fighting are somewhat like the <HI>Scottish</HI> Ar∣rows only somewhat longer and headed with Iron, Wood or Fish-Bones. But the Ar∣rows for Provision are of 3 sorts; the first serveth to kill any great Beast near hand, and hath an Iron head of a Pound and a half, shaped like the head of a Javelin, as sharp, as a knife: The second for lesser Beasts, and hath an head of three-quarters of a Pound. The third for all manner of Birds, and hath a head of an ounce weight. These heads tho of Iron, yet kept their edge long. For these and such uses Iron is of more value here than Gold: and he that can temper it well is most esteemed.</P>
<P>Every day we marched at Sun Rising,
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>
continuing till 10 in the Forenoon, then resting (near some River) till past 12, we marched till 4 a clock at night, when we reposed our selves in some convenient place.</P>
<P>When we came to the place we intended to lodge at, the <HI>Symerons</HI> laid aside their Burthens, to cut down Poles and <HI>Palmito</HI> Boughs or <HI>Plantain</HI> leaves, and with speed set up six Houses; first fastning 3 or 4 great Posts with Forks, deep into the ground, up∣on them they laid one Transome (about 20 foot) making the sides like the roofs of our Country Houses, Thatching it close with the aforesaid Leaves, so that it would keep out rain a long time.</P>
<P>We found near the Rivers several Fruits, as <HI>Mammeas, Guyavas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Limons,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>3d.</HI> day of our Journey they brought us to a Town of their own, situate upon the side of a Hill near a River, encompassed with a Dike 8 foot broad, and a thick mud Wall 10 foot high. It had one long and broad Street from East to West, and two cross Streets narrower; there were in it fifty or sixty households, which were so cleanly, (that not only the Houses, but Streets were plea∣sant. Their Apparel is somewhat after the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> fashion. This Town is distant from <HI>Nom∣bre de Dios</HI> 35 Leagues, and 45 from <HI>Panama,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>
it is sufficiently stored with Beasts, Fowls and several Fruits.</P>
<P>As for their Religion, they have no kind of Priests, only they hold the Cross in great reputation: but at our Captains persua∣sion they were contented to leave their Crosses and learn the Lords Prayer, and be instruct∣ed in some measure in Gods True Worship. They keep a continual watch in 4 parts with∣in 3 miles of the Town, for fear of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> who sometimes by the Conduct of some <HI>Symerons,</HI> Captives to them, have come in upon them.</P>
<P>We stayed there all night, during which time they related unto us several Broils be∣twixt them and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> particularly one: A Gentleman entertained by the Go∣vernor of the Country undertook last year, with 150 Souldiers to put them, Young, and Old to the Sword, being conducted by one of them that had been taken Prisoner; he sur∣prized it half an hour before day, whereby many of the Men escaped, but many Wo∣men and Children were killed: but the same morning by Sun rising (their guide being slain) the <HI>Symerons</HI> assembled themselves and behaved in such sort, that they drove the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> to such extremity, that partly by the disadvantage of the Woods, having lost their guide, and partly by famine, not above 30
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>
of them returned. Their King dwelt in a City 16 Leagues South-east of <HI>Panama,</HI> wherein are supposed to be 1700 fighting Men.</P>
<P>Our Captain was kindly entreated by them all, and was desired to abide with them some time, but he being intent on his Journey, thankt them for their kindness, and march∣ed on in his intended Journey.</P>
<P>The order of our March was thus; Four of the <HI>Symerons</HI> as knew the way best went a mile before us, breaking off Boughs of Trees and throwing them on the way for a direction to those that followed, 12 of them were our Vantguard, and 12 our Rereward, we in the middle.</P>
<P>Our way through Woods by reason of the shade was cooler than it is in most parts in <HI>England,</HI> in the Summer time.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 11. We came to a High Hill, mid∣way where was a great Tree whence we might see both the North and South <HI>Atlan∣tick</HI> Ocean; one of the <HI>Symerons</HI> took our Captain by the hand and led him up thither who likewise called us up to it. The Tree was cut, and several steps made in it to as∣cend; near unto the top was made a con∣venient Bower, wherein 10 or 12 Men might easily sit.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="21"/>
Being throughly satisfied with the sight, we descended, and continued our former Jour∣ney; when we came to the Champion Coun∣try we found the Grass of an extraordinary height. The Inhabitants are forced to burn it thrice a year that their Cattel may feed on it; after which it springs up fresh in 3 days; Its stalks are as big as a Wheaten reed, and though Cattle feed on it, yet in a few days it grows so high that they cannot reach it.</P>
<P>After we were come within a days Journey of <HI>Panama,</HI> for fear of being discovered, we went out of the ordinary way, and came to a Grove within a League of <HI>Panama;</HI> thence we sent a <HI>Symeron</HI> who had been formerly at <HI>Panama,</HI> in habit of a <HI>Negroe,</HI> to learn on what night (for they travel from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> by night, by reason they have no shades there, but from thence to <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> by day, for that the Country there a∣bounds in Woods) they were to carry their Treasure to <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI> who returning certified us that the Treasurer of <HI>Lima</HI> was to go that night with 8 Moyles laden with Gold, and one with Jewels. And further, that there were 2 <HI>Recoes,</HI> 50 Moyles in each, la∣den mostly with Victuals, with some little quantity of Silver, to come forth that night af∣ter the other. Hereupon we marched till we
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>
came within 2 Leagues of <HI>Venta Cruz;</HI> two of our <HI>Symerons</HI> sent before, found a <HI>Spani∣ard,</HI> whom they brought to us; who exa∣mining him were confirmed of the truth of that our Spy had told us. This Souldier having learned who our Captain was, prayed him to preserve him from the fury of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> and that seeing he was a Souldier, and assured him of more Gold that night than they could dispose of, besides Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That he would please to let him have so much as might suffice him and his Mistress to live upon.</P>
<P>Being at the place appointed, our Captain with half his men lay on one side of the way about 50 paces off in the long Grass; <HI>John Oxnam</HI> with the Captain of the <HI>Symerons</HI> and other half on the other side of the way, the like distance; but so far distant that by that time the one Company could seize on the foremost Moyles, the other might take the hindmost, and likeways that if we should have any Skirmish that night, we might not endamage our own men. We had not lain thus, much above an hour, when we heard the <HI>Recoes</HI> coming, and going betwixt <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Venta Cruz.</HI> And though strict charge was given that none of our men should stir as any passed from <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> as know∣ing they had nothing but Merchandise; yet
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>
<HI>Robert Pike,</HI> one of our men forgot himself and entising a <HI>Symeron</HI> with him, went hard by the way side, and a Cavalier from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> coming by, stood up to see what he was, and though the <HI>Symeron</HI> pull'd him down again, yet the Gentleman took notice of him, seeing one all in White, (for we had put our shirts over our Cloaths that if we should happen to Skirmish with them we might know our own men in the night) and presently put spurs to his Horse. This al∣teration of his Horses pace was observed by our Captain, who therefore suspected we were discovered, but could not imagine by whose fault. Yet supposing it might be by reason of the danger of the Place, we lay still in expectation of their coming, who by this time were within half a League of us, and had come, but that this Gentleman meeting them reported what he had seen, and persuaded the Treasurer it was either Captain <HI>Drake,</HI> or some from him, who, ha∣ving been frustrate of their hopes of Trea∣sure from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> were resolved to have it here, and thereupon he prevailed with him to turn his <HI>Recoe</HI> out of the way, and to let the other <HI>Recoes</HI> which were laded mostly with Victuals to pass on, in regard the loss of them would not be considerable. Thus were we disappointed of a most rich booty.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="22"/>
The other two <HI>Recoes</HI> coming up we sei∣zed upon them. One of their chief Car∣riers told our Captain how we were disco∣vered, and withal advised us to shift for our selves betimes. Whereupon <HI>Pedro,</HI> the Chief of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> told us that there were but two ways for escape, either to Travel back the same secret way we came, for four Leagues, into the Woods; or else to make a way through <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> by our Swords; The latter of which notwithstanding the dangerousness of it, our Captain chose, as being the shortest way. Therefore command∣ing all to refresh themselves, he told them his resolution, asking <HI>Pedro</HI> if he would give him his hand, not to forsake him, which he willingly did, vowing that he would rather dye at his Feet than leave him to the Ene∣mies Fury, if he held this course. Thus we took our Journey to <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> with help of the Moyls, till we came within a Mile of the Town, where we turned away the <HI>Recoes,</HI> charging their Conductors not to follow us. There the way is cut through the Wood, so as two <HI>Recoes</HI> may pass by one another. For those Woods grow as thick as our thickest Hedges in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A Company of Soldiers came out against us to the middle of this Wood, with whom a Convent of Fryers joyned; Our Captain
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
informed of their coming, by two <HI>Symerons</HI> sent before, gave charge that none of us should shoot till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had first Fired. When they came up, their Captain charged ours to yield our selves Prisoners, which our Captain refusing, they immediately Fired, doing us no considerable hurt, save only <HI>John Harris</HI> one of our Company was kil∣led. But our Captain perceiving their Shot slacking, gave us a Sign to discharge upon them, and then march or wards with in∣tent to close with them. They retired to a place of greater strength, and we hasten∣ed our pace to prevent it. Which the <HI>Syme∣rons</HI> perceiving (though frighted with the Shot they had stept aside) rushed forwards with their Arrows ready in their Bows, leap∣ing and dancing, and singing <HI>Yó pehó, yó pe∣hó,</HI> and so continued till we overtook some of the Enemy, who conveyed themselves within the Woods to have taken their stand at us. But our <HI>Symerons</HI> brake in through the thickest of them, forcing them to flye; diverse of our men were Wounded and one <HI>Symeron</HI> killed, who yet revenged his own death before he died.</P>
<P>Thus we entred the Town, being about 40 or 50 Houses, having both a Governor and other Officers, and some fair Houses, with some Store-houses, besides he Monastery.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="23"/>
We found here 3 Gentlewomen lately de∣livered of Children who were come hither from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to bring forth their Children; because it hath been observed that no <HI>Spaniard,</HI> or White, could ever be delivered at <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> but the Chil∣dren died within 3 days; yet being brought up here or in <HI>Panama</HI> 5 or 6 years, and then brought to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> if they escap't sick∣ness six weeks they lived as healthy as any where. These Gentlewomen at our first coming were in great fear, yet, our Captain having charged the <HI>Symerons</HI> to hurt none save those that were Armed, they received no harm. Having set our Guards on all passages to prevent danger, we stayed in this Town an hour and a half refreshing our selves, and our Company and the <HI>Symerons</HI> had got some Pillage. A little before we departed 12 Horsemen come from <HI>Panama,</HI> supposing we had been gone, entred the Town, but were forced quickly to retire.</P>
<P>Thus having dispatcht our business in this Town we marched over the Bridge, ob∣serving the same order as formerly, and our Captain longing to be at his Ships hastned his Journey as much as possible, by reason whereof we marched with hungry Stomachs.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="24"/>
In our absence the <HI>Symerons</HI> we left with our men had built a little Town 3 Leagues off where our Ship lay, where our Captain at their entreaty made some stay, and sup∣plied us with Shoes, which had been wore out in our Journey.</P>
<P>These <HI>Symerons</HI> were very serviceable to us, being to us guides, Intelligencers, Pur∣veyors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when any of our men was wearied, two of them would take him up and carry him 2 miles together, and like∣wise shewed themselves very Valiant.</P>
<P>At our first entrance into this Town our Captain dispatcht a <HI>Symeron</HI> with an order and token to the Master of our Ship, who being come was quickly set aboard; and shewing a Tooth-Pike of Gold, which he said our Captain had sent for a token to <HI>Ed∣ward Hixom</HI> with charge to meet him at such a River, tho the Master knew it was the Captains, yet by reason of his former order he demurred, which the <HI>Symeron</HI> per∣ceiving, told him, that because it was night when he was sent, our Captain could not send a Letter, but with the point of his Knife wrote upon the Tooth-Pike; where∣upon the Master looking upon it, read it, and being confirmed of the truth of it, prepa∣red accordingly, and repaired to the mouth of the River of <HI>Tortugos,</HI> where we met to our
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>
mutual rejoycing. We seemed to those who had been at rest aboard, strangely meta∣morphosed, which might probably be through our long Fasting and Travel, but our inward grief for being frustrate of our design, was no doubt the main cause.</P>
<P>Thus returned from <HI>Panama,</HI> our Cap∣tain purposing further to attempt the same Journey, he would not suffer the edge of his men to be rebated. And therefore ha∣ving a design to attempt in some other places, and particularly <HI>Veragua,</HI> a rich Town lying between <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua</HI> where is the Richest Mine of Gold on this North side, he asked his Company their opi∣nions. Some thought it best to procure more Victuals, that we might keep close till a convenient time, which might easily be done, seeing the Victual Frigates were not well Defended, whereas the Treasure Fri∣gats were well Manned. Others were for intercepting Frigats laden with Treasure, both because we had store of Victuals, and that they might be had at any time, where∣as Treasure was only to be found when the Fleet is there, which was now. The <HI>Symerons</HI> being askt their opinion, declared that near <HI>Veragua Sinnior Pezoro</HI> (their Ma∣ster, from whom they had fled) had dwelt in a strong Store house, above 19
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>
years, who seldom went abroad; and that he keeps 100 Slaves in the Mines (each be∣ing obliged to bring in daily of gain 3 <HI>Pe∣zoes</HI> of Gold for himself, and two for his Women (8 s. 3 d. the <HI>Pezoe)</HI> whereby he had gathered a vast Treasure, being cruel and covetous, and never went abroad with 5 or 6 men in his Guard, although he was always in fear. And that if our Captain were so resolved they would so conduct him thither as he should not be descried, but might surprize them, and that although his House were very strong yet they could easi∣ly procure him access to his Treasure.</P>
<P>Our Captain having heard all their opi∣nions, concluded to reconcile the 2 first opinions, and therefore sent <HI>John Oxnam</HI> Eastwards to provide for Victuals, he him∣self resolving to go Westwards in the <HI>Minion,</HI> to lye off and on the <HI>Cabezas</HI> to attend the Frigats that transported the Treasure: But disliked the <HI>Symerons</HI> proposal, lest our men might thereby be wearied, whom he design∣ed to strengthen for his next service.</P>
<P>Therefore he dismissed such of the <HI>Sy∣merons</HI> as were desirous to go, with such gifts as were most pleasing, entertaining still aboard those that were willing to stay, and so they steered their course as is said.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="25"/>
The <HI>Minion</HI> about the <HI>Cabexas</HI> met with a Frigate of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> in which was some Gold, having a <HI>Genoway</HI> Pilot, who being ci∣villy used, certified our Captain of the state of the Town, and Harbor, and of a Fri∣gate wherein was a Million of Gold, ready to depart in a few days, offering to conduct him to it, if he would do him his right, for that he know the Channel so well that he could enter safely by night, and utterly undescried, and that because the way by Land from the point is far and difficult, and by Sea but 5 Leagues, though we were dis∣covered, we might dispatch our business be∣fore the Town could have notice. He like∣wise told he heard of <HI>Drakes</HI> being on the Coast, whereby they were greatly afraid, but had not as yet provided themselves a∣gainst him.</P>
<P>Our Captain hearing this, had a mind to return to his Ship, to have been better in∣formed of the place by some <HI>Symerons</HI> there; But the <HI>Genoway</HI> urged to lose no time, promising success if we delayed not, and therefore our Captain following his ad∣vice, set in for to enter the Harbor.</P>
<P>But when we came to the mouth of it, we heard a report of 2 Chambers, and a∣bout a League off, 2 Answering them, where∣by our <HI>Genoway</HI> suspected we were disco∣vered,
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
assuring us that this order was taken since his departure.</P>
<P>But not only this, but providence like∣wise crossed our designs. For the wind that formerly was Easterly turned to the West; whereupon we returned to our Ship, where on <HI>Sheer Thursday</HI> we met according to appointment with our <HI>Bear,</HI> who had em∣proved his time better than we, having taken a Frigate wherein were 10 men, great store of <HI>Maiz,</HI> 28 fat Hogs, and 200 Hens. Our Captain unladed her and made her up for a Man of War, having heard by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they were building 2 little Gallies in <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to waft the <HI>Cha∣gro</HI> Fleet to and fro, but not yet lanched, Wherefore he purposed to take that Fleet, and, to encourage his Company, feasted them sumptuously that <HI>Easterday</HI> being <HI>Mar.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>The next day with this new Frigat and <HI>Bear</HI> we set for <HI>Cativaas,</HI> and landed 2 days after, staying till noon, when seeing a Sail to the Westward, we plyed towards her, and she bare with us till they saw we were no <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and their Catain supposing us those <HI>English</HI> men he had heard of he made towards us.</P>
<P>He was a <HI>French</HI> Captain of <HI>New-Haven</HI> and being distrest he prayed our Captain to help him to some Water, for that he had
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>
nothing but Wine and Sider aboard, which had greatly empaired the health of his men. Our Captain sent him some relief for the pre∣sent, willing him to follow us to the next Port where he should be better supplyed. He sent our Captain a Case of Pistols and a guilt Symeter (which had been the late K. of <HI>France</HI>'s whom <HI>Mons. Mongomery</HI> hurt in the Eye, and was given him by Mr. <HI>Stroffe)</HI> and our Captain requited him with a Chain of Gold, and a Tablet.</P>
<P>This Captain reported to us the first news of the Massacre in <HI>Paris</HI> at the K. of <HI>Na∣varres</HI> Marriage on St. <HI>Bartholomews</HI> Day last, of the Admiral of <HI>France</HI> slain in his Chamber, and divers others of the Popish Cruelties. He told what famous reports he had heard of us; and he desired to know of our Captain what way he might compass his Voyage. Tho' our Captain was jealous of him, yet upon consultation he resolved to take him and divide his men and put them with ours proportionably, so as we needed not fear much hurt of them, so that we might both gratifie them and serve our own turn. Having thus agreed with him we sent for the <HI>Symerons;</HI> two of them were brought aboard our Ship, to give the <HI>French</HI> assurance of this agree∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="27"/>
As soon as we had furnisht our selves and re∣fresht the <HI>French,</HI> which was done in five or six days, taking twenty of the <HI>French</HI> and fif∣teen of ours, with our <HI>Symerons,</HI> and leaving both our Ships in safe Road, we man'd our Frigat and two Pinnaces, and went toward <HI>Rio Francisco,</HI> and because it had not Water enough for our Frigat we left her at the <HI>Ca∣bezas,</HI> man'd with <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> to <HI>Robert Doble,</HI> to stay there till our Pinnaces return'd; and then bare to <HI>Rio Francisco,</HI> where our Captains landed, and ordered them, that had the Charge of the Pinnaces, to be there the fourth day following.</P>
<P>And thus knowing that the Carriages went now daily from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> we went secretly through the Woods, towards the High-way, betwixt them; it is reckoned five Leagues by Sea but the way we went was seven. When we were come within an English Mile of the way, we past the night in great silence, in a convenient place, where we heard the Car∣penters working in their Ships, as they usu∣ally do by reason of the heat of the day there. The next morning upon hearing the great number of Bells, the <HI>Symerons</HI> rejoyced, as having that opportunity again, of which we were disappointed before; now they assu∣red us we should have more Gold than we
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
could bear away, as in truth it fell out: For there came three <HI>Recoes,</HI> one of fifty Moyls; the other two of seventy each, which carri∣ed in all near thirty Tun of Silver. We put our selves in readiness, and went down near the way, where we stayed not long till we saw them, and took such hold on the fore∣most and hindermost Moyls, that all the rest stayed and unladed, as their manner is.</P>
<P>They were guarded with about forty five Soldiers, which occasioned some small Skir∣mish, in which Conflict the <HI>French</HI> Captain was dangerously wounded, and one <HI>Symeron;</HI> but in the end we put them to flight, and then we unladed the Moyls. And being weary we were content to take a little with us as we could easily carry, hiding the rest in convenient places.</P>
<P>But when we had disposed of all our matters (being about two hours) and were ready to march back, we heard both Horse and Foot coming, as it seemed to the Moyls, for they did not follow us, after we entred the Woods; and the <HI>French</HI> Captain disa∣bled by reason of his Wounds stayed, ho∣ping thereby to recover his strength. But after we had marched two Leagues, the <HI>French</HI> Souldiers complaining that they wanted one of their Men also; and it was found upon examination that he had drunk
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
too much Wine, and over-lading himself with Pillage, and hasting to go before us, lost himself in the Woods; and, as we af∣terwards knew, he was taken by the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> that night, and upon Torture shewed them where we hid our Treasure.</P>
<P>We marched all that day and the next, to <HI>Rio Francisco</HI> to meet our Pinnaces; but when we came thither we saw seven <HI>Spanish</HI> Pinnaces. Whereupon we were afraid that they had taken or spoiled ours, our Captain having given them strict charge to repair thither. But the night before there having fallen much Rain, and the Wind contrary and boysterous, our Pinnaces could not come thither, whereby they were preserved from the danger of falling into the <HI>Spaniards</HI> hands, who had been sent on purpose to take our Pinnaces, upon their hearing that we intercepted the Treasure; our Captain fear∣ing lest having taken our Pinnaces they had forced our Men by Torture to confess where his Frigat and Ships were; yet he comforted us when we were fearing the worst, &amp; said to us; <HI>It is no time now to fear, but rather to hast to prevent that which is feared: And suppose the Enemy to have taken our Frigats, yet it would require time to examine Mari∣ners, and to execute their resolution, before which time we might get to our Ships, tho</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>
<HI>not by Land, yet by Water. Let us therefore make a Raft with Trees that are happily brought down the River this last Storm, and put our selves to Sea; I will be one, who will be the other? John Smith</HI> offered himself, and two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> that could swim well, and a <HI>Symeron,</HI> especially <HI>Pedro</HI> (who was left be∣hind because he could not Row.) The Raft was fitted and a Sail of Bisket. Sack prepared; An Oar was shaped out of a young Tree to serve for a Rudder. Our Cap∣tain at his departure promised, that if it plea∣sed God he got safe aboard his Frigat, he would in despite of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> get them all aboard. Thus they sailed three Leagues sitting continually up to the Waste in Wa∣ter, and at every Surge of the Waves to the Armpits, whereby their Skins were much fretted. At last they see the two Pin∣naces, to our Captains great joy, who know∣ing them, chearfully declared to the rest, that they were our Pinnaces, and that all was safe. But the Pinnaces not seeing the Raft, nor suspecting any such matter, and Night and Wind growing on, were forced to turn into a Cover behind the Point to stay that night. Which our Captain seeing put his Rafter a shore, and ran by Land about the Point, where he found there, who upon sight of him made as much hast to have him A∣board,
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
as being afraid he was chased by the Enemy, seeing him thus running, and at∣tended by so few. But when he was got Aboard he rid them of their doubts, shewing them a Quoit of Gold, thanking God that our Voyage was made. And he told the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> that their Captain, with two of his Men, were left behind, sore wounded, but it should be no disadvantage to them.</P>
<P>That night our Captain Rowed to <HI>Rio Francisco,</HI> where he took in the rest with the Treasure; and by dawning of the Day sailed back to our Frigat, and from thence to our Ship, and then divided the Gold and Silver equally betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>About a fortnight after, having taken all necessaries out of our Ship, into our Frigat, and given her to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> we had de∣tained all this time, we set out with the <HI>French</HI> Ship, Riding some days by the <HI>Cabe∣zas.</HI> In the mean time our Captain s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/> twelve of our Men with sixteen <HI>Symerons,</HI> to try if they could liberate the <HI>French</HI> Captain that was taken, or at least, bring away the Treasure we had hid, <HI>John Oxnam</HI> and <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sherwell</HI> were intrusted with it; For they would by no means hazard our Captain who yet conveyed them ashore at <HI>Rio Fran∣cisco,</HI> where he received one of the <HI>French∣men,</HI> who having escaped the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
now coming towards our Pinnace, he told us that within half an hour after our depar∣ture the <HI>Spaniards</HI> overtook them, and took his Captain, and his companion; but that he escaped by reason he cast away all his car∣riage, and that thereby he made himself fit for flight. As for our Silver we hid, he thought it was all carryed away, for near 2000 <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI> were digging up all the ground thereabout for it. Notwithstanding this, our Men went to the place, and for all the narrow search that was made, brought back to our Frigate 13 Bars of Silver, and some Quoits of Gold. Now we purposed to go homewards, and our Captain in order there∣unto designed to look for a sufficient Ship to carry so much Victuals as might serve for our Voyage.</P>
<P>The <HI>French-men</HI> having formerly gone from us, met with us again, and were very loth to leave us, but accompanied us to St. <HI>Bernards,</HI> and would further; but that we heard the Fleet was ready to Sail for <HI>Spain,</HI> riding near <HI>Cartagena.</HI> Thus we departed from them passing by <HI>Cartagena</HI> in fight of all the Fleet, with a Flag of St. <HI>George</HI> in the Main Top of our Frigate, with Silk Streamers and Ancients down to the Water, Sailing forwards till night, when we lay off
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
and on, bearing small Sail. About Mid∣night we took a Frigate come from <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> of 25 Tuns, laden with Maiz, Hens, and Hogs, with some Honey, (which was then very useful, as reviving our crazed People.) The next morning we set the Pri∣soners ashore, and without stop Sailed to the <HI>Cabezas,</HI> where we hove all our lading ashore, and brought our Frigats on the <HI>Ca∣rine,</HI> and new tallowed them.</P>
<P>Being ready to depart we burnt our Pin∣naces, that the <HI>Symerons</HI> might have the Iron work; and our Captain desired <HI>Pedro</HI> with some others of them, to take what they had a mind to in the Ship, promising to with-hold nothing from them, without which we could subsist in our Voyage, and that he would look out some Silks and Linnen for their Wives; which while he was choosing out of his Trunks, <HI>Pedro</HI> espyed the <HI>Cymeter</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Captain had given him, and had a great mind to it, and being loth to ask our Captain for it himself, he desired another to do it for him, promising him a Quoit of Gold for his pains, and that he would give our Captain 4 other great Quoits. Our Captain being accordingly moved for it, though un∣willing to part with it, yet willing to gratifie him that had deserved so well, gave it him. He was exceedingly rejoyced hereat, declar∣ing,
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
that he would present his King with it, who he knew would make him a great man for it, and in requital he desired our Captain to accept four pieces of Gold. Our Captain received it in most kind sort, but put it not to his own private use, but caused it to be cast to the whole adventure, saying that it was reason that they which bare part of his burthen in setting him to Sea, should share in the profit.</P>
<P>Thus we took our leave of that People setting over to the Islands of—, and thence towards <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> but being to stand for the <HI>Havana</HI> we plyed to the Wind∣ward several days, at which time, we took a small Bark in which were 200 Hides, and a Pump which we set in our Frigat. The Bark, as not useful for us, we gave them a∣gain, and afterwards came to <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Antho∣ny,</HI> where we refreshed our selves, and took 250 Turtles by night, which we powdered and dried for our use.</P>
<P>There were at this time belonging to the several Plantations of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> above Two Hundred Frigates some of 120, some of 12, but most of 30 or 40 Tuns, most of which during our abode in those parts we took, and some of them twice or thrice, and yet never burnt or sunk any of them unless Men of War sent against
<PB N="54" REF="31"/>
us, or set to entrap us. The Men we used very civilly, either immediately dismissing them, or if we kept them any time, provi∣ding for them as for our selves, and sheltered them from the Rage of the <HI>Symerons.</HI> We set Sail from this <HI>Cape</HI> of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and performed our Voyage very prosperously. For whereas our Captain intended to touch at <HI>New-found-land</HI> there to have Watered, being very scarce of it, it pleased God to give us such store of Rain Water that we were suf∣ficiently furnished, and within 23 days, we past from the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Florida</HI> to the Isles of <HI>Silley,</HI> and so arrived at <HI>Plimouth</HI> on Sunday about Sermon-time, <HI>August 9th.</HI> 1573.</P>

<HEAD>Sir Francis Drake <HI>His Voyage about the WORLD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CAptain <HI>Francis Drake</HI> having in a former Voyage in the year 1572. and 73. had some view of the <HI>South Atlantick</HI> and thereupon conceiving a desire of being better acquainted with it, tho he was crossed in his design for several years, partly through secret envy, and partly by his serving here for his Prince and Country; at length in the year 1577. By Gracious commission from his Soveraign and by help of divers Friends Adventurers, he fit∣ted himself with 5 Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Pelican,</HI> Admiral, burthen 100 Tuns, Captain Ge∣neral <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Vice-Admiral, burthen 80 Tuns, Captain <HI>Jo. Winter;</HI> the <HI>Marigold,</HI> a Bark of 30 Tuns, Captain <HI>Jo. Thomas;</HI> the <HI>Swan,</HI> a Fliboat
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
of 50 Tuns. Captain <HI>Jo. Chester;</HI> and the <HI>Christopher,</HI> a Pinnace of 15 Tuns.</P>
<P>These Ships he Mann'd with 164 able Men, and furnished them with all necessaries, not forgetting ornaments and delights, ha∣ving with him several expert Musicians; he likewise made some Pinnaces, but carried aboard in pieces for to be set up when occa∣sion served. Thus furnished, we set Sail from <HI>Plimouth, Nov.</HI> 15. 1557. at 5 a Clock in the Afternoon; but meeting with contrary Wind we were forced to put in at <HI>Falmouth.</HI> The next day there arose such a Storm, that the Admiral and <HI>Marigold</HI> were fain to cut their main Mast: And therefore when the Storm was over we returned to <HI>Plimouth</HI> to repair our damages; which done we put to Sea again, <HI>Dec.</HI> 13. When we were out of sight of Land we easily conjectured whither our General intended, by his course, and his appointing <HI>Mogadore</HI> our place of meeting if any of our Ships should be parted from the Fleet. The first Land we had sight of, was <HI>Cape Cantine</HI> in <HI>Barbary</HI> on <HI>Christmas-day</HI> in the Morning. The shore is White sand, the In-land mountainous, in 32 deg. 30 min. North lat. Coasting from hence 18 Leagues Southward, we arrived at the Island <HI>Moga∣dore</HI> before named. It is under the King of <HI>Fess,</HI> in 31 deg. 40 min. a mile off the shore
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>
making a good Harbor between the Land and it. It is uninhabited, but a League in Circumference, overgrown with shrubs not unlike our Privet, full of Doves, and much frequented by ravenous Birds. At the South side of it are 3 hollow Rocks, under which are store of wholesom, but ugly Fish. We sent a Boat to sound the Harbor, and finding it safe, we brought in our Ships, <HI>Dec.</HI> 27. and continued there till the end of the Month, setting up one of our Pinnaces. The Inha∣bitants perceiving us, gave us signs of their desire to be brought aboard, to whom our General sent a Boat, in which two of the <HI>Moors</HI> were received, one of ours being left ashore as a Pledge.</P>
<P>We entertained them very courteously that they might thereby understand that we came in peace, offering to traffick for their Coun∣try commodities. To this they agreed, pro∣mising, to bring such things as they had to exchange for ours. It is a Law among them to drink no Wine, notwithstanding privately they taste it liberally, as we found. At their return they restored our Pledge. The next day they brought with them Camels in shew loaden with Wares; and therefore according to order (our General being then ashore in the Island) we shut off a Boat. Our Boat being come to Land, <HI>John Fry</HI> one of our men
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>
mistrusting no danger, stept out of the Boat, but was presently laid hold of, and carried away. The cause of this was a desire the K. had to know whence our Fleet was; whether it were a forerunner of the K. of <HI>Portugals;</HI> but he having declared who we were, was immediately sent back with a present to his Captain. But in the mean time our Captain resenting it, landed his Company, and marched into the Country without resistance; wherefore having pro∣vided some Wood, and viewed an old Fort built by the K. of <HI>Portugal,</HI> now ruined by this K. we departed, <HI>Dec.</HI> 13. for <HI>Cape Blank,</HI> so that when <HI>Fry</HI> return'd we were gone, yet the K. sent him home to <HI>England</HI> in an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P>Till <HI>Jan. 4th.</HI> we had Foul weather; yet we reached <HI>Cape de Guerre,</HI> where we took 3 <HI>Spanish</HI> Fishermen, and carried with us to <HI>Rio del Oro</HI> under the Trop. of <HI>Cancer</HI> where we took a Carvel; from thence we Sailed to Cape <HI>Barbas,</HI> and took another Carvel, and <HI>Jan.</HI> 16. to <HI>Blank.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Cape</HI> lyeth in 20 deg. 30 min. on the North side resembling the Corner of a Wall; the Land betwixt it and <HI>Barbas</HI> is low and Sandy. Here we observe the South <HI>Guards</HI> (called the <HI>Crosiers)</HI> 9 d 30 m. above the <HI>Horizon.</HI> We took a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship ri∣ding
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>
here; all her men having fled save two, and carried her with the rest into the Harbor 3 Leagues within the <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P>Here, being a plentiful place, our General purposed to stay a while to refresh his men. During our aboad he was visited by the Peo∣ple of the Country, who brought down a Woman a <HI>Moor,</HI> with an Infant hanging by her dry dug, having scarce life in her, to be sold as a Cow and Calf, but our General would not deal in such goods. They also brought Ambergreece and Gums to exchange for Water, of which they are very scarce; our General gave them Water, but would take nothing for it, as also some of our Victuals; their manner of eating whereof was In∣human.</P>
<P>Having trimmed our Ships and discharg∣ed the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> save one we took with us, we departed for the Islands of <HI>Cape de Ver∣de,</HI> intending there to take in Water, for that from thence we intended straight for <HI>Bra∣zil</HI> without touching Land. And having the Wind at N. E. and E. N. E. Trade Winds being usual in those places, we Coasted <HI>Bonavista,</HI> and the next day, <HI>Jan.</HI> 28. we came to Anchor in the West part of the Island <HI>Maio</HI> in 15 deg. being high Land, save only the Northwest part, a League from the Sea very low, and is Inhabited by the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="34"/>
Landing here we found a great many rui∣nous Houses with a poor naked Chappel. The Springs and Wells were stopped up, and we could have no Water for our use, where∣fore we marched up to seek some, or at least to see if the People could be prevailed with to help us. In this Journey we found the soil very fruitful, full of Fig-Trees, and in the Valleys, where their Cottages were, Vineyards bearing ripe Grapes, tho now in Winter, (the Sun scarce ever withdrawing himself from them.) There were also <HI>Coco</HI> Trees, no branches sprouting forth but at the Top, with several others. We found good Water in several places, but being far off the Road, we could not carry it to our Ships. The People would not come near us, keeping themselves close in their Houses.</P>
<P>This Island hath great store of Goats, Hens, and Salt made Naturally by the Suns heat, so that of the product thereof, they keep continual Traffick with the adjacent Islands. We departed thence <HI>Jan.</HI> 30. Next day we passed St. <HI>Jago</HI> 10 Leagues West in the same Latitude, inhabited by <HI>Portugals,</HI> and <HI>Moors.</HI> The <HI>Portugals</HI> being former∣ly sole Lords of that Country, used that ri∣gor towards their Slaves, that they were forced to try some means of help, and there∣upon fled to the Mountainous parts, where
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>
by continual escapes encreasing to a great number, they now live in that terror of their oppressors that they endure no less bon∣dage in mind than formerly in Body; be∣sides the damages in their goods and Cattel, they suffer dayly from them.</P>
<P>On the South-west of this Island, we took a <HI>Portuguese</HI> laden with Wine, Wollen and Linnen Cloath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bound for <HI>Brazil.</HI></P>
<P>As we passed by in sight of 3 of their Towns, they shot off 3 great Pieces, which we answered.</P>
<P>Twelve Leagues South of St. <HI>Jago</HI> lies that Island called by the <HI>Portuguese Fogo,</HI> the Burning Island, in which riseth a steep Hill 6 Leagues high, within the bowels of which is a constant fire, which breaketh out with violence 4 times an hour. Herein is engendered a great quantity of Pumice stones, which being by the Vehemency of the Fire, carried up into the Air, fall down upon the Hill, and many times into the Sea. The rest of the Island is fruitful, and Inha∣bited by <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>Two Leagues to the South of this Island, lies a pleasant Island, full of Trees, which are always green, whence it is cal∣led the <HI>Brave Island,</HI> being a Storehouse of many Fruits, as Figs, Coco's Plantons, Oranges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> full of pleasant streams of
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>
Water: But there is no convenient Road for Ships. For after long sounding, we could find no ground at any hand, neither was it ever known that any line would fetch ground in any place about the Island. So that the Top of <HI>Fogo,</HI> burneth not so high in the Air, but that the root of <HI>Brava</HI> is buried as low in the Seas. The only Inhabi∣tant of this Island is an Hermite, as we sup∣pose, for we saw but one House, built as it seems for such purpose; and he was so de∣lighted in his solitary life, that he would by no means abide our coming, but fled, leav∣ing behind him a Cross with a Crucifix, and such other Idolatrous trash.</P>
<P>Here we dismissed the <HI>Portugals,</HI> taken at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and gave them for their Ship our new Pinnace, with Provision to carry them home.</P>
<P>Having thus taken in fresh Water, we departed, <HI>Feb.</HI> 2. and fell with the Coast of <HI>Brazil, Apr.</HI> 5. 1578. during which Voy∣age, where we saw nothing but Sea and Air; as we beheld the wonderful Works of God in his creatures, so likewise we did tast the goodness thereof, for relief of our ne∣cessities. We often had adverse Winds, and sometimes Calms, and also terrible Light∣nings and Thunder, yet with a mixture of comforts; for it pleased God that (whereas
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>
we were but badly furnished with Water) when we were within 4 degrees of the Line on this side, and past it so many on the other, we had every day some rain, whereby our want of Water was much supplied. This was also observable, that notwithstanding the badness of the passage, and Storms we some∣times had, yet not one of us lost our com∣pany save only the <HI>Portugal</HI> prize for one day, but next day found us again.</P>
<P>Among the many strange creatures we saw, we took particular notice of a flying Fish, as big as the ordinary Pilchards, its fins are of the length of its whole body, resemb∣ling and supplying the use of Wings; for therewith, when it is chased by bigger Fish, and cannot escape by Swimming, it lifteth it self above the Water, and flyeth a pret∣ty height, sometimes lighting on Boats or Barks: The Quils thereof are proportiona∣ble, set together, with a thin Film, so that they would serve for a longer or higher flight, but that the dryness of them is such, that unless moistned every 10 or 12 strokes, they grow stiff and unfit for motion. The encrease of this Creature is wonderful, which if it had not been so, their kind could not have been continued, they being a prey to so many Creatures. And when they flee into the Air, in shunning one hazard, they com∣monly
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>
incur another by some ravenous Foul.</P>
<P>When we came within 3 Leagues of <HI>Bra∣zil,</HI> in 31 deg. 30 min. South latitude, ha∣ving 12 Fathom Water, we were descried by the Inhabitants, and we saw huge fires made by them in several places, which custom though it be universal among Christians and Heathens, yet is differently used by them, to wit, for a sacrifice to Devils, with many other conjurations, casting up heaps of sand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that if any Ships stay upon their Coast, their ministring Spirits may make wrack of them, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have found to their loss. But this devilish intent of theirs was of no effect to us, for though we had great Storms, yet we sustained no da∣mage but the separating our Ships. And seeing we could find no Harbor thereabout we coasted along Southward, till <HI>April</HI> 14 in the morning we passed by <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Mary</HI> in 35 deg. near the mouth of the River <HI>Plate,</HI> and running within it 6 or 7 Lea∣gues we came to Anchor under another <HI>Cape</HI> which our General after called <HI>Cape Joy,</HI> because the second day after our An∣choring here, the <HI>Christopher,</HI> we had lost in the former storm, came to us again. The cares our General took besides the main care of effecting our Voyage, were
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>
these; to keep our whole Fleet together; to get fresh Water for our men; and to re∣fresh them when wearied. And therefore at our departure from <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> the next place of meeting, if we should be dispersed, or for Watering, was appointed to be the River of <HI>Plate.</HI></P>
<P>The Country thereabout is temperate, of a sweet Air, and fruitful soyl: and hath a∣mong other things, plenty of large Deer.</P>
<P>We removed hence 12 Leagues further, where was a long trace of Rocks, not far from the Main, making a commodious Har∣bor, especially against the South-wind, and rode till the <HI>20th</HI> day, where we killed store of Seals. We weighed again hence and sail∣ed further up the River till we had but 3 Fathom, and were in fresh Water, but because the Winds were strong, and we could have no safe Harbor there, we went to Sea a∣gain, <HI>Apr.</HI> 27. The Land here lieth, S. S. W. and N. N. E. with shoal water some 3 or 4 Leagues off into the Sea; it's in 36 deg. 20 min. or better, South. Latitude.</P>
<P>At our coming to Sea the <HI>Swan</HI> lost com∣pany of us. And therefore our General to pre∣vent the like in those that remained, knowing that the Coast (it drawing now toward Win∣ter) uses to be subject to tempestuous wea∣ther, determined to seek out some conveni∣ent
<PB N="66" REF="37"/>
Harbor, and searched all that Coast from 36 to 47 deg. but found none. And <HI>May</HI> 8. by another Storm the <HI>Caunter</HI> was severed from us. <HI>May</HI> 12 we saw Land in 47 deg. where we came to Anchor in such Road as we could for the time. Our Ge∣neral named the place <HI>Cape Hope,</HI> by rea∣son of a Bay within, which promised a con∣venient Harbor. But by reason of the ma∣ny Rocks lying off it, we durst not hazard our Ships into it, without trial first made.</P>
<P>Our General (who never was wont in matters of importance to trust to other mens care) went himself with some others in a Boat, <HI>May</HI> 13. to sound it out: and being now nigh the Shore, suddenly a thick fog arose with a great tempest; our General thought it now best to return to his Ship but the fog was so thick that, they could see none of us. Captain <HI>Thomas</HI> out of love to our General, hazarded in with his Ship, where he found him, and received him aboard, and then dropt an Anchor there, and lay safe during the Storm, while we were tos∣sed at Sea. The next day the weather being fair, our General went ashore, that he might by making of fires gave signs to the disper∣sed Ships to come together again, whereby at last they all met except the <HI>Swan</HI> and our <HI>Portugal</HI> prize, the <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="37"/>
In this place (the people being fled for fear of our coming) we found near the Rocks, in houses made for that purpose, 50 <HI>Ostriches</HI> at least, with other Foul, some dryed and some drying for their provision. The <HI>Ostriches</HI> Thighs were as big as ordinary Legs of Mutton; they cannot flie, but run so swift∣ly that a man cannot overtake them, nor come within shot of them: we found the Instru∣ments the people use to take them with: Among others this is one; they have a large Plum of Feathers tyed together upon the end of a Staff, in the fore part resembling the Head, Neck and Bulk of an <HI>Ostrich;</HI> in the hinder part, spreading it self out so large as to hide the Body of a man: with this they drive them into some neck of Land by the Sea, where spreading long Nets, with their Dogs, they overthrow them. The Coun∣try is very pleasant, and of a fruitful Soil. Being afterwards driven to this place again, we had great familiarity with the people, who rejoyeed at our return, because we had done no hurt this time: But because this place was not fit for our purpose we depart∣ed <HI>May</HI> 15. and held our course S. and by W. In 47 deg. 30 min. we found a Bay convenient for us, in which we Anchored <HI>May</HI> 17. and the next day went further in, where we abode 15 days.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="38"/>
The first day of our arrival here, our General sent Captain <HI>Winter</HI> Southward, he himself going to the North, in search of the 2 Ships, and it pleased God he met with the <HI>Swan,</HI> which he brought with him into the Harbor; where being unladen, she was cast off, and her Iron work and other necessaries reserved for use, the remainder being made fire-wood. The other Ship we could not as yet hear of.</P>
<P>After a little stay here, some of our men being ashore, in an Island near the Main, the People of the Country shewed them∣selves to us, with Leaping, Dancing, Shout∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after their manner; Our General sent a Boat straight to them, with Knives, Bells, Bugles and such things, whereupon they assembled on a Hill near the Water-side &amp; sent 2 of their Company, running one after the other with great grace, but when they drew near, they halted, refusing to come to our men; which our men perceiving sent such things as they had, and laid them in their view, and as soon as our men were departed they came and took them, leaving in exchange thereof Feathers, and Bone made in fashion of a Toothpike, carved about the top, 6 Inches long. Whereupon our General with divers others at low Wa∣ter went over to the Main.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="38"/>
Against his coming they remained still on the Hill setting themselves all in one Rank, ordaining one of them to run from one end of it to the other, and back again, East and West, holding his hands over his Head, and yielding forward his Body to∣ward the rising and setting of the Sun, and every 2d or 3d turn erecting it towards the body of the People after their ridiculous manner. When they saw us ascending the Hill to them, they seem'd afraid. Which our General seeing retired, whereby they were confirmed we had no design to injure them, and came down with great speed after us, and trafficked with us. The wares we had from them were Arrows of Reeds, Feathers, and Bones as aforesaid.</P>
<P>They go Naked, except a Skin of Fur they cast about their shoulders, when they sit in the cold; but when they are doing any work, they gird it about their Loins. They wear their Hair long, and when they Tra∣vel they put it up with a roll of <HI>Ostrich</HI> Feathers, using these rolls likewise for Qui∣vers, and for carrying provision, some on either side within these rolls (for a sign of honor) have a large and plain Feather shewing like horns a far off.</P>
<P>They paint their Bodies, with divers co∣lours: some wash their Faces with Sulphur;
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
some paint their whole Bodies black leaving only their Neck white; some one Shoulder black another white, and their Sides and Legs after the same manner, the black part hath set upon it white Moons, and the white black Suns, the Marks and Characters of their Gods.</P>
<P>This advantage (I conceive) they have of painting their Bodies; that it Armeth them against the nipping cold, for the Co∣lours being soakt into the inner part of their skin, fills up the pores so close that no cold can enter. They have clean, comely and strong Bodies, they are swift of foot and Active.</P>
<P>It's strange to think how they having ne∣ver before known Christians, in a short time were so kind, judging us a People they ought to serve, not injure, esteeming our General as a Father, us as Brethren. One of the chiefest of them receiving a Cap of our Generals went a little from us, and pierced hie Leg with an Arrow till the Blood streamed, hereby signifying his unfeigned Love. They were in all, that conversed with us, about 50.</P>
<P>In the Southermost part of this Bay there is a fresh Water River wherein are a great many Islands, of which some have such store of Seals as would mantain an Army of men:
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
others are in like sort replenished with Foul. We could not perceive that People had any Boats, or Canows to come to these Islands. Their Victuals for ought we saw they eat raw. They go all Armed with Bows an Elve long, with Arrows of Reeds, and head∣ed with Flint-stone Artificially cut and fastened.</P>
<P>This Bay by reason of plenty of Seals we called <HI>Seal Bay</HI> (for we killed 200 in one hour.) And being now well provided, we Sailed thence <HI>June</HI> 3. towards the Pole <HI>Antarctick. June</HI> 12. we Anchored in a little Bay and stayed 2 days, discharging our Caunter the <HI>Christopher,</HI> which we laid up here.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 14. We departed and kept our course till the <HI>17th.</HI> then we Anchored in a Bay in 50 deg. 20 min. distant not above a degree off the mouth of the <HI>Streights,</HI> through which lay our way to the South Sea.</P>
<P>Here our General altered his course, and steered Northward, to seek after our Ship we had lost, because that if we entred the <HI>Streight</HI> without them, it would go hard with them. And next day being <HI>June</HI> 19. towards night, within a few Leagues of St. <HI>Julian</HI> we found her: and because both Ship and men were distressed by weather,
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>
our General bare into St. <HI>Julian, June</HI> 20. that he might repair her, and refresh them. It standeth in 49 deg. 3 min. South. Lat. and hath on the South side of the Harbor picked Rocks, and in the Harbor many Islands. Being come to Anchor, our General with some of his Company, rowed further in a Boat, to find out a place for Watering. At his landing 2 of the Inhabitants (by <HI>Magellane</HI> called <HI>Patagous</HI> or <HI>Pentagours</HI> from their huge stature, and strength) vi∣sited him, seeming to rejoyce at his arrival: taking great pleasure in seeing Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> (Master Gunner of the Admiral) shoot an <HI>English</HI> Arrow, trying to shoot with him, but were far short of him.</P>
<P>Another of these came up, and checkt his fellows for their familiarity with us, and dealt with them to become our Enemies; which our General and his men not suspect∣ing, used them as before, and one <HI>Robert Winter</HI> shooting an Arrow at length, his Bow-strings broke; which they seeing, fear∣ing that more than our other weapons, took courage, and coming behind them, while they, suspecting nothing, were going to∣wards their Boat, shot at him who had the Bow, that he might not string it again, and wounded him in the Shoulder, whereupon he turning about was with another Arrow
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>
shot through his Lungs, yet he fell not. And the Master Gunner discharging his Calliver, which miscarried, was slain out∣right. In this extremity our General, be∣having himself Wisely and Couragiously, ordered his men to shift from place to place, encroaching upon the Enemy, and to use their Targets and other weapons for their defence, and to break as many Arrows as they could come by; knowing that their Arrows being spent, they could have them at their pleasure. And he himself shooting off the Calliver, dispatched the beginner of the quarrel, who had killed our Master Gunner, whereby the courage of his part∣ners was abated, so that they were glad to save themselves by flight. Our General chose rather to depart, than take revenge, that he might save one of his men who was dangerously wounded, who notwith∣standing dyed 2 days after he was carried aboard. Our Gunners Body being left a∣shore that night, our General next day with his Boat well manned, went ashore to fetch it, which they found lying where it was left, but stript of his outer Garment and an Arrow stuck in his right Eye. Both these Bodies were decently interred in one Grave.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="41"/>
<HI>Magellane,</HI> rightly termed them Giants; for they differ from the common sort of men, in Stature, Bigness, Strength of Body and Hideousness of Voice, but they are not so monstrous or Giant like as reported, there being some <HI>English</HI> men as tall as they. But the <HI>Spanish</HI> cruelties have made them more monstrous in mind than they are in Body, and inhospitable to Strangen. Notwithstanding, the terror they conceived of us, so quench't their heat, that they for∣got revenge, and seeming to repent of the wrong done us, suffered us to do what we would for 2 months space without mo∣lestation.</P>
<P>To this evil received of them, a greatr was devised among our selves, but it was detected and prevented in time, which if it had taken, our General and his faithful Friends, had been murthered, to the final frustrating of our whole design.</P>
<P>This Plot had been contrived at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and was discovered to our General there, yet our General gave no credit to it, as being a person he had such affection to. And therefore afterward he not only con∣tinued his favour (to this suspected person) but used him as his bosom friend. And he was often offended at them who discovered the Treachery to him. But at length per∣ceiving
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>
his lenity did no good, and that his Ambition was not allyed, he resolved to call his practices in question before it were too late. And therefore assembling his Captains he had him before them, where the Gentleman knowing himself Guilty, shewing great remorse for his unkind deal∣ing, besought them to execute justice upon him. Whereupon they all adjudged him worthy of death. This judgments was held ashore in one of the Islands of that Port, which in memory of that was called the Island of <HI>True Justice and Judgment.</HI> He desired to receive the Sacrament before his death, which was granted. And <HI>John Fletcher,</HI> Preacher of the Fleet administred it to him: Our General likewise communi∣cating with him: afterwards they dined to∣gether as lovingly as ever they had done, and took their farewel as they had only been going a Journey. After dinner the sentence was executed upon him, he shew∣ing great remorse for that heinous crime, and great signs of devotion at his death. Af∣terwards we buried him, setting a Mill-stone we found there, broke in two, at his head and feet, and engraved thereod the names of our men that were buried, and a memo∣rial of our Captains name in Latine.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="42"/>
After he was executed, our General discharging the <HI>Mary,</HI> our <HI>Portugal</HI> Prize, (being leak) defaced her; and having Wa∣tered and Trimmed our Ships, and reduced our Fleet to 3 Ships, besides our Pinnaces, we departed this Port, <HI>Aug.</HI> 3. and set our course for the <HI>Streight,</HI> S. W.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 20. We fell with the <HI>Cape,</HI> near which is the entrance into the <HI>Streight,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> called <HI>Capo Virgin Maria,</HI> appearing at 4 Leagues distance, with steep gray Cliffs full of black Stars, against which the Sea beating represents the spouting of Whales, the highest Cape being like Cape <HI>Vincent</HI> in <HI>Portugal.</HI> At this Cape our Ge∣neral caused his Fleet in homage to our Soveraign Lady the Queens Majesty, to strike their Top-sails: and in remembrance of his Honourable Friend, Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton,</HI> he changed the name of his Ship from the <HI>Pelicane</HI> to the <HI>Golden Hind.</HI> Which being ended with a Sermon, and Prayers, and Thanksgiving for her Majesty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we continued our course into the said Frete, and came into a narrow Strait exceeding dan∣gerous, it lyeth W. N. W. and E. S. E. and having lost it we came to a large Sea; the night following, we had an Island in sight equal to <HI>Fogo</HI> in height, and burning like it.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="42"/>
It hath formerly been reported as truth, that the Seas have a continual current from East to West in this <HI>Streight,</HI> but we found it otherwise, the Ebbings and Flowings be∣ing as orderly here as on other Coasts.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 24. We fell with 3 Islands bearing Triangle wise one from another, in one of them, being large and Fruitful, our Ge∣neral with some of his men landed, taking possession of it in Her Majesties name, and called it the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Island. In the other 2, which were not so large, we found good store of strange Birds, which could not fly at all, nor run so fast as to escape us; they are less than a Goose, and bigger than a Mal∣lard, short, and well set together, having no Feathers, but in stead thereof a sort of hard and matted Down: their Beeks are like the Bills of Crows, they lodge and breed on Land, where making earths as Coneys do in the Ground, they lay their Eggs. They feed on the Sea, where they swim incredibly swift. In one day we killed 3000 of them. These 2 Islands our General named, the one St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s the other St. <HI>George</HI>'s.</P>
<P>In the Island of St. <HI>George</HI> we found the Body of a man so long dead before, that his bones fell asunder, being moved out of the place they lay in.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="43"/>
From these Islands to the entry of the South Sea the Frete is very crooked. And though it be true that <HI>Magellane</HI> reporteth of this passage that there are many fair Har∣bors and store of fresh Water, yet when any contrary Winds arise, it is extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>The Land on both sides is high and Mountainous, having on the North and West the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> on the South and East nothing but Islands, among which lye innumerable Fretes into the South Sea, the Mountains are prodigious for height, being still encreased with congealed Clouds, and frozen Meteors, which are scarce ever diminished by the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>Yet the plain grounds are fruitful, the Grass plenteous, Herds many of very strange sorts, the Trees for most part always green, the Air temperate as ours.</P>
<P>When we approached the entrance of the South Sea, we were so shut up to the North∣ward, and had such large and open Fretes to the South, we knew not what way to pass, without further discovery; and that our Ge∣neral, Anchored the Fleet under an Island, went with some others in a Boat, to find the passage, which having done they returned, meeting with a Canow under the same I∣sland,
<PB N="79" REF="43"/>
which was made of the Bark of di∣verse Trees, having a Prow and Stern standing up, and Semicircle wise yielding inward: the Body of most excellent Work∣manship: so that our General concluded that it was not contrived by the Art, nor for the use of such rude people as these: it had no other caulking in the Seams but stitching with thongs made of Skins, and yet kept out the Water,</P>
<P>The People are of a low stature, but compact, they paint as the others do. With∣in the Island they had a mean Cottage of Poles covered with the skins of Beasts.</P>
<P>Their Vessels and Cups are of Barks of Trees. Their working-tools they use are knives made of huge and monstrous Mussel shels, which after they have broke off the thin and brittle substance of the Edge, they grind upon stones, till they have put such an Edge on them that they will cut the hard∣est Wood, yea the hardest Bones.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 6. We got free of these Islands and entred the South Sea; at the Cape where∣of our General intended to have gone ashore, and there after a Sermon Preached, to have left a Monument of her Majesty, Engraven in Mettal; but could not conveniently.</P>
<P>By all our observations we conluded that this Strait was 150 Leagues in length, the
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>
bredth in some places more, in others less; and in the end found it to be no Strait, but only Islands.</P>
<P>When our General saw that our men were not able to endure the cold he intended to have returned toward the Line, lest our men by the excessive cold might contract some grievous distemper; but it pleased God to thwart his design. For the 2d. day after we entred <HI>Mare Pacificum,</HI> a Furious storm with contrary Winds arose, whereby we were in great Jeopardy of our lives,</P>
<P>In the time of this storm, <HI>Sept.</HI> 15. the Moon was Eclipsed in <HI>Aries,</HI> and darkned about 3 points for 2 hours; but our storm continued 52 days. And <HI>Sept. 30th.</HI> in the night, the storm encreasing, the <HI>Marigold</HI> was separated from us; whom we never met again, altho our General had ordered, that if any of our Fleet lost our Company, we should meet again on the Coasts of <HI>Peru</HI> in 30 deg. or thereabout.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sept.</HI> 7. (when the storm began) till <HI>Oct.</HI> 7. we could not recover Land (be∣ing driven to 37 deg. of South. Lat.) and this day toward night entred a Harbor, on the aforesaid Streight toward the South Sea, hoping to shelter till the storm were over, but had not been there 3 hours, till by vi∣olence of the storm, our Admiral lost an
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
Anchor by the violence of the Flaw, and also lost sight of our Vice-Admiral the <HI>Ele∣zabeth,</HI> which we never saw more, for she arrived in <HI>England, June</HI> 20. next year. So that now our Admiral was left alone, and altho our General sought the rest of his Fleet carefully, yet could by no means find them. Thus parted from our friends, we were driven back into 55 deg. South Lat. among the Islands aforesaid. And after we had been there 2 days, and a∣little refresht our selves, of a sudden a Tem∣pestuous storm arose, whereby we were in extreme hazard of our lives, and expected to be swallowed up every moment. But it pleased God of his infinite mercy, when all our hopes were gone, miraculously to deliver us. Being thus delivered, we were necessitated to seek for some place of refuge, both to provide necessaries, and refresh our men. We returned among the said I∣slands, where we hoped for better rest, and the rather because we found the Peo∣ple of that Country travelling from one place to another, with whom we trafficked for several commodities, and had respite for 3 days, being in continual fear of the immi∣nent dangers, the troubled Seas, and bluster∣ing Winds threatned us; which accordingly happened; for we were assaulted by a more
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>
vehement storm, leaving behind us our An∣chor, and a great part of our Cable, driven betwixt Wind and Water, till we fell with the uttermost part of the Land, towards the South Pole, when we discovered how far the same reacheth South ward from the Coast of <HI>America</HI> aforenam'd.</P>
<P>The uttermost Cape of these Islands lyes in 56 deg. where no Mainland nor Island is to the South, but the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and South Sea met.</P>
<P>It was hitherto dreamed that these Islands were a Main, and that it was <HI>Terra Incog∣nita,</HI> and truly it might be so called before this time, for before this it was never dis∣covered, that we heard of.</P>
<P>And here we may refute that error, held by many, that it is impossible to return out of <HI>Mare del Zur</HI> into the Ocean, by reason of the supposed Eastern Current, and Levant Winds; for neither did we meet with such Current, nor had such Winds to carry us through, but always in our passage found it easier to return into the West Ocean than to go forward into <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> where∣of we had much experience, being glad oft times to alter our course, and fall a stern a∣gain, with frank Wind, further in one After∣noon, than we could fetch up again in a
<PB N="83" REF="45"/>
whole day with a reasonable gale. They are no less mistaken in alledging the narrowness of the Frete; for we found the quite con∣trary.</P>
<P>As we reached the utmost part of these I∣slands, <HI>Oct.</HI> 28. our storm ceased. Here we found the night in the latter end of <HI>Octob.</HI> not above 2 hours long, so that it seems, when the Sun is in the Tropick of <HI>Caprioorn</HI> they have little or no night. The Inhabi∣tants Manners Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are, the same with those aforementioned, before we entred the <HI>Streights.</HI> Our General called these Islands <HI>Elizabethides.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 30. We departed thence steering our course North-west, to coast along <HI>Peru</HI> (be∣ing the appointed place for our Fleet to re∣assemble) the next day we came to 2 Islands, wherein were great store of Birds, whereof we were sufficiently furnished with Victuals; Thence, steering still North-west, we found our selves, like to have been deceived in taking our rules by the common Maps, which set down the Coast of <HI>Peru</HI> to lye 12 deg. Northwards from the supposed <HI>Streight</HI> when it is quite contrary, and therefore we altered our Course.</P>
<P>That part of <HI>Peru</HI> all along to the height of <HI>Lima</HI> being 12 deg. South of the Line, is mountainous and barren, except a few
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>
places Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>Being thus fallen with the Land, we Coasted along till we came to 37 deg. and finding no convenient place, nor likelyhood of hearing of our Ships, we ran off with an Island in sight called by the <HI>Spaniards Mucho,</HI> where we Anchored <HI>Nov.</HI> 25. and found it to be a fruitful Island, well stored with all necessaries, as Sheep, and other Cattel, Maiz, a kind of Grain they make Bread of, <HI>Potatos</HI> and such other Roots besides it is plenteous of Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The In∣habitants are such <HI>Indians</HI> as by the cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were driven from the Main. With them our General intended to Traffick for Victuals and Water; and for that end the same night we arrived, he and some others went ashore, to whom the Peo∣ple shewed respect, making a present to our General; we also presented them such things as we had, signifying that we came to Traffick, and recruit our selves with fresh Water; and they promised to furnish us with such things as they could afford. The next day our General repaired to the shore, and sent 2 of his men, with their <HI>Baricoes</HI> to the Watering place assigned, who ha∣ving past half of the way, were traiterously slain by the People; who having likewise
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>
set an ambush for our General and the rest of our men that were in the Boat, behind the Rocks, suddenly wounded most of our men, before they could free themselves; our Ge∣neral besides several wounds on the face and head, had one passing through his Nose into the <HI>Basis Cerebri.</HI> But the worst of all was, we had none to cure our men save a Surgeons Boy, yet it pleased God they were all cured. The cause of this barbarity of these Islanders was their hatred to the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> (whom they suspected us to be.) Our General tho he might have revenged this with small loss, yet valuing the loss of one of his more than 100 of theirs, he desisted, committing his cause to God. The weapons this People use in their Wars are Arrows of Reeds with heads of Stones very brittle and indented, and Darts of a great length headed with Iron, or Bone. The same day that this hap∣pened we departed thence, and because we were nownear the appointed place of meeting, and partly because our men were crasie, we set in for some convenient place in the Main, and coming to the Bay called <HI>Philips-Bay</HI> in about 32 deg. we dropt Anchor, and sent our Boat to discover, if the place could fur∣nish us with such things as we needed; they after long Travel, could see no appearance of relief, either as to Victuals or Water,
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>
seeing nothing save huge heads of wild Buffs; but in their return, they espied an <HI>Indian</HI> fishing in his Canow, whom they brought aboard. Who being courteously entertained, after we had shewed him what we had, and made him understand what we needed, we sent him away with our Boat and his own Canow to land him where he would; who at his landing, willed our men to stay till his return, and anon met 2 or 3 of his friends, to whom he shewed his gifts; which gave such content, that a little after, he with their Governour and others came to us, bringing with them Hens, Eggs, Hogs and such like, and (that they might remove suspicion of evil) they sent it in a Ca∣now by it self, and their Governor entrust∣ed himself to our men, and came to our Ge∣neral. By him we understood, we could not be relieved here, but he offered to conduct us to a Harbor not far distant to the Southward, where we might have all necessaries; which our Gen. accepted of; and <HI>Dec.</HI> 4. depart∣ed hence, and next day came to an Anchor in that Harbor. It is called by the <HI>Spaniards Valperizo,</HI> and the Town adjoyning St. <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Chinly;</HI> it is in 35 deg. 40 min. here we had all necessaries in abundance: amongst other things we found in the Town, diverse store-houses of the Wines of <HI>Chinly,</HI> and in
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>
the Harbor a Ship called the <HI>Captain</HI> of <HI>Mo∣rial,</HI> or the <HI>Grand Captain of the South, Admiral to the Islands of</HI> Salomon, laden mostly with the said Wines, and besides, some fine Gold of <HI>Baldivia, &amp;c.</HI> We spent sometime in refreshing our selves, and easing this Ship of her burden, and <HI>Dec.</HI> 8. being furnished with necessaries we departed, re∣turning back to the Line, with our <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot, whom our General rewarded to his own content, and set him ashore again where he desired.</P>
<P>Being thus provided our General was for seeking after our Ships; And considering that we could not conveniently run in with our Ship to every Harbor, and that our Boat could not carry men enough, to en∣counter the violence of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if we happen'd to meet them, we determined, as we went toward the Line to seek out a convenient place, where we might trim our Ship, and build a Pinnace.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 19. We entred a Bay to the South∣ward of the Town of <HI>Cyppo</HI> Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in 29 deg. 30 min. and ha∣ving landed 14 of our men to search, we were discovered by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who sent out 300 men, 100 of them being <HI>Spaniards,</HI> well mounted on Horses, the rest <HI>Indians</HI> running as Dogs at their heels all naked.
<PB N="88" REF="48"/>
But our men seeing them come, made all their escape, save one <HI>Richard Minivy,</HI> who being too bold, would not be entreated to escape with the rest, but chose either to out∣brave them, or die in the place; which he did. His Body was by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be∣headed, his right hand cut off, his heart pluckt out, all which they carried away in our sight, the rest of his Body they caused the <HI>In∣dians</HI> to shoot full of Arrows made of green wood, and left it, which we buried next day. Finding but bad entertainment here we departed, and next day came to a conve∣nient Harbor to the Northward of it, in 27 deg. 55 min. South Lat. where we trimmed our Ship, and built our Pinnace; which done our General, with some of his Company went in the Pinnace, in search of our Ships, but after a days sailing, were forced to return by contrary wind.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 9. we left this place, and <HI>Jan.</HI> 22. came to an Island in the same height with the North Cape of <HI>Mormorena;</HI> here we met with 4 <HI>Indians</HI> in their Canows, who promised to bring us to a place where we might Water, but when we came thither, we scarce found any. As we were search∣ing for Water, we lighted on a <HI>Spaniard</HI> sleeping, who had by him 13 Bars of Sil∣ver, weighing 4000 <HI>Spanish</HI> Duccats which
<PB N="89" REF="48"/>
we took. Not far from hence we met with another <HI>Spaniard</HI> with an <HI>Indian</HI> Boy, driv∣ing 8 <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, each Sheep bearing 2 leathern bags, in each of which was 50 pound weight of fine Silver, which we likewise took.</P>
<P>Beyond the Cape aforesaid we passed several <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, the People whereof came to us in Boats made of several Skins, of which 2 being joyned together of equal length in form of a Boat, having in each of them a small Gut, or some such thing blown full of Wind, whereby it floateth, and is rowed very swiftly; they exchanged with us Fishes for Knives, Glasses and such like, great rarities to them.</P>
<P>Not far hence lies <HI>Mormorena</HI> in 22 deg. 30 min. where tho 2 <HI>Spaniards</HI> governed, yet we exchanged with them for several Commodities: among other things Sheep which were as big as a Cow, with strength proportioned; on one of their backs at one time 3 men and a Boy might sit without touching the ground by a foot, without any trouble; their Wool is very fine, their flesh good, and they serve in stead of Horses for burdens. Here &amp; toward the province of <HI>Cusko,</HI> 100 <HI>l.</HI> of common earth yieldeth 25 s. of pure Silver, after the rate of a Crown an Ounce.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 7. We came to <HI>Arica</HI> in 20 deg.
<PB N="90" REF="49"/>
which stood in the fruitfullest soil in all that Coast; it is Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> In 2 Barks here we found Forty and odd Bars of Silver, each weighing about 20 <HI>l.</HI> which we took; and so went to <HI>Chowley, Feb.</HI> 9. and in our way to <HI>Lima</HI> we took a Bark loaden with Linnen: <HI>Feb.</HI> 15. we arrived at <HI>Lima,</HI> and tho the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had 30 Ships in the Harbor, we Anchored a∣mong the midst of them. <HI>Lima</HI> is in 12 deg. 30 min. Here we heard of a Ship that had 1500 Bars of Silver in her besides other things we boarded her and took what we had a mind to. Here also we had news of the Ks. of <HI>Portugal,</HI> of <HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Fez</HI> all dead in one day at one Battel; also of the death of the K. of <HI>France</HI> and the Pope. Lastly here we had notice of a rich Ship laden with Gold and Silver for <HI>Panama,</HI> that had set sail from this Haven: Where∣upon <HI>Feb.</HI> 16. we went in pursuit of her. <HI>Feb.</HI> 20. We fell with the Port of <HI>Paita</HI> in 4 deg. 40 m. with St. <HI>Helen</HI> and the River <HI>Gutaquil, Feb.</HI> 24. We past the Line 28, and <HI>Mar.</HI> 1. Fell with <HI>Francisco,</HI> where a∣bout mid-day we descried a Sail, and when we had made up with her and boarded her, we found her to be the Ship we were pursuing: We found in her some Fruits, Conserves, Sugars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a great quantity of Jewels,
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>
and precious Stones, 13 Chests of Ryals of Plate, <HI>80l.</HI> weight of Gold, 26 Tun of un∣coyned Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> valued about 360000 Pezoes. We gave the Master a little Linnen for these Commodities, and after 6 days de∣parted.</P>
<P>And being now come to Cape <HI>Francisco</HI> in 1 deg. <HI>N.</HI> Lat. and hearing nothing of our Ships all the way, tho we enquired diligently, we concluded they were not before us; and considering that now was the only time (Sum∣mer approaching) for the discovery of what passage there was to be found about the Nor∣thern parts of <HI>America</HI> from the South Sea in∣to our Ocean, which our General chiefly de∣signed, we all willingly consented to seek out a convenient place for furnishing our selves, and trimming our Ship in order there∣to. And so we set on <HI>March</HI> 7. to the Island of <HI>Caines</HI> at which we arrived <HI>March</HI> 16. and settled in a fresh River for our purpose aforesaid. In our Journey hither, we met with a Ship laden with Linnen, and <HI>China</HI> Silk and Dishes, and a Faulcon of Gold with a great Emerauld in its breast. We depar∣ted hence <HI>March</HI> 24. for our intended disco∣very, and passed by the Port <HI>Papagaia,</HI> and diverse others, and some Gulphs which con∣tinually send forth violent Winds. And un∣derstanding that if we did not run off to Sea
<PB N="92" REF="50" MS="y"/>
we should be troubled with Calms, our Ge∣neral determined to go into some Port to fur∣nish our selves with all necessaries, that we might go to Sea. And accordingly <HI>April</HI> 15. 1679. we entred <HI>Guatulco,</HI> in 15. deg. 46. min. inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where we had necessaries, as also a Pot as big as a Bushel full of Ryals of Plate, with a Chain of Gold and Jewels.</P>
<P>From thence we departed to Sea <HI>Apr.</HI> 16. and sailed 500 Leagues for a Wind, and until <HI>June</HI> 23. 1500 Leagues in all, till we came to 42. deg. of North. Latitude, where in the Night time we were opprest with extreme nipping cold, whereby several of our mens health was impaired, and the day following notwithstanding the heat of the Sun, the cold was nothing abated, so that the Ropes of our Ships were frozen, and the Rain which fell was a kind of Icy substance. And when we came 2 degrees further it was in that ex∣tremity, that our men could not make use of their hands, not to feed themselves; and our Meat as it was removed from the fire was in a manner immediately frozen, whereby our men were extremely discouraged; yet by our Generals persuasions, they resolved to endure a little extremity to obtain agreater Glory.</P>
<P>The Land in that part of America lying
<PB N="93" REF="50"/>
nearer the West, than we imagined, we were nearer it than we were aware; and the nearer it we came the colder it was. <HI>June</HI> 5. we were driven on the shore by contrary Winds, and cast Anchor in a Bay, where we were in danger by reason of extream flaws that beat upon us, and upon their inter∣mission were troubled with thick, stinking Fogs.</P>
<P>In this place we could not abide, by reason of cold, and therefore were forced to go Southwards again. From the height of 48. to 38. coasting along the Land, we found it to be plain; every hill (which were many but not high) though it was <HI>June,</HI> was co∣vered with Snow. <HI>June</HI> 17. in 38. deg. 30. min. we found a fit Harbor and anchored therein, continuing till <HI>July</HI> 23. and were still molested with cold. We conjecture upon se∣veral reasons that either there is no Northern passage, or at least not navigable, for to pass by others this seems to confirm it, that tho we searched the Coast diligently even to 48. deg. yet found we not the Land to trend so much as one point in any place towards the East, but rather running on towards the Northwest.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 18. The Countrey People sent out a man in a Canow to us, who directed his discourse to us all the way as he came;
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>
and being come near us, he had a tedious Oration, using many motions; which ended with great shew of reverence he returned: He came again the 2d. time as also the 3d. after the same manner, and brought with him, as a present, a Bunch of Feathers arti∣ficially gathered on a string, made for those who guard the Kings Person to wear on their heads, he brought also a Basket made of Rushes, filled with an Herb, called <HI>Tabak.</HI> Our General proffered him several things, but he would receive nothing save a Hat.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21. Our Ship being leaky we put in to the shore to repair her; (but to prevent all danger, our General landed all his men, with necessary Provisions to build Tents, and make a Fort for us; Which the Coun∣try People seeing, came down in great hast to us with such Arms as they had, yet with no intent to hurt us, their intent being ra∣ther to worship us as Gods. And being willed by signs to lay from them their Bows and Arrows, they did it instantly.</P>
<P>To the intent therefore that this Peace which was desired might be more confirmed, our General treated them very courteously, bestowing upon them Shirts, Linnen, and other things, to cover their nakedness, withal signifying unto them, that we were but men
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>
as they were, which notwithstanding, we could hardy persuade them of. They in re∣compense bestowed on our General and others of our men, Feathers, Cawls, and Quivers of their Arrows, made of Fawns Skins, and Skins of Beasts their women wore; and so departed with joy to their Houses; which are digged round within the earth, having clefts of Wood set up and joyned close at the top, like our Spires; they are very warm and without Chimneys; Their Door is like an ordinary scuttle in a Ship slope-wise, their Beds on the Ground with Rushes strewed upon it. Their men for most part go na∣ked; They are of a tractable and loving Nature; Their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, with which tho they are skillful they do but little execution, they are so slight, being more fit for Boys than men; they are prodigiously strong and swift. Their Women make themselves loose Gar∣ments of a kind of Bulrushes to cover their lower parts: about their shoulders wearing the Skin of a Deer; They are very obedient to their Husbands.</P>
<P>When they were returned home they emitted lamentable Cryings, which we heard tho about an English Miles distance.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding their submissive demea∣nor, our General thought it best not to trust
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>
them too much, and, therefore with expedition we set up our Tents and entrenched our selves with a Stone-Wall, that so if they proved perfidious we might be able to repel them. Two days after a great multitude of them came to us, bringing presents with them as before, or rather sacrifices, they deeming us to be Gods.</P>
<P>When they came to the top of the Hill at the bottom whereof we stayed, they stood, where one with strange gestures delivered a tedious Oration, at the end whereof all the rest bowing their bodies cried <HI>Oh,</HI> (as a sign of their assent;) after which their men came down, leaving their Women and Children, with their Bows on the Hill, with presents to us, glad that we would receive them of them: in the mean time their Women fell a Crying, Shreeking, and tearing their Flesh from their Cheeks, with a fury casting them∣selves on the Ground, dashing themselves on hard Stones or any thing it was in their way, those that were big with Child not ab∣staining from this madness. Which our Ge∣neral seeing fell a praying with Hands lifted up to Heaven (shewing that God, whom we served, and they ought to worship, was above) and sung Psalms, and read in the Bible: to all which they were very atten∣tive, and took such delight in our Singing of
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>
Psalms, that every time they came to us they desired us to sing.</P>
<P>Three days after the greatest part of all that People thereabouts assembled, with the King attended with his Guard. Before his coming he sent 2 Ambassadors to signifie it to us; in delivery of their message, the one spoke low the other the same word for word more au∣dibly, which done our General understood by their signs that they desired a present of him to their <HI>Hioh</HI> or King; which he sent.</P>
<P>As their King was coming to us, they cried after a singing manner; and as they drew near their carriage was more grave. In their Front a man bare the Scepter (a cer∣tain kind of black Wood a Yard and a half in Length) before the King, whereon Hanged 2 Crowns with 3 long Chains, and a bag full of the Herb <HI>Tabah.</HI></P>
<P>Next him that bare this Scepter was the King: on his head was a Cawl of Knit∣work somewhat like a Crown: on his Shoul∣ders to his Wast a Coat of Coney Skins; his Guard had Coats of other Skins, some having Cawls with such Feathers, or covered with a Down, which groweth on an Herb like Lettice: This Herb is not permitted to be wore by any but those that are about the King, and the seed of it is used only in sacri∣fice to their Gods. After these came the
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>
common People, naked, whose long hair was tied in a Bunch behind, in which stuck Plumes of Feathers, but in the fore part had but one Feather like a Horn. Every one had his Face painted, but of different colours. Their Women and Children came last, The Women had Baskets in their Arms, wherein were Bays of <HI>Tabah</HI> and other presents: Their Baskets were made of Rushes, yet in such sort that most part of them would hold Water; they were hanged with pieces of Pearls Shells, and with 2 or 3 links of the Chains, signifying they were Vessels dedicated to the use of their Gods.</P>
<P>Our General assembled all his men and ordered them to be in a posture of defence, that if they attempted any thing against us might we prevent it.</P>
<P>When they came near us they gave us a general Salutation; after which he that bare the Scepter spake aloud what another whis∣pered him in the ear for half an hour, which was ended with a general <HI>Amen;</HI> and all the rest, save the Children, came down the Hill setting themselves in their former order.</P>
<P>Being come near us the Scepter-bearer with a stately carriage began a song, dancing thereto, as also did the King and all the rest, save the Women, who danced but did not sing. Our General perceiving their simple
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>
meaning ordered that they might have free entrance; they entring continued their Song and Dance a pretty while, their Wo∣men following with their Baskets, their faces <HI>&amp;c.</HI> torn as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Afterwards they made a sign to our General to sit down, and the King with others made several Speeches, esiring him by signs to take upon him the King∣dom, and afterwards with one consent they set the Crown upon his Head, with other Ceremonies, honouring him by the name of <HI>Hyoh,</HI> ending the Solemnity with Songs and Dances.</P>
<P>These things our General accepted of, taking them in the Name and to the Use of Her Majesty. The Ceremonies ended, the common People of them leaving the King with our General, went among our People, and finding such as pleased their Fancies (which commonly were the youngest of us) they enclosing them round offered sa∣crifices; Crying with lamentable shreeks, weeping, scratching, and tearing the flesh off their Faces.</P>
<P>After our necessary businesses were dis∣patched, our General with some of his Company went up into the Land, to be bet∣ter acquainted with the Nature and Commo∣dities of their Country. The Inland we
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>
found to be of a very fruitful soyl, Stored with all things fit for man, particularly fat Deer in great numbers. There were like∣wise a strange sort of Conies, their heads and bodies like other Conies, but smaller; their Tails like that of a Rat, and their Feet like the Paws of a Mole. Under their Chins on each side they have a Bag into which they gather their meat when their Bellies are full, to feed their young, or sorve themselves another time. Their Skins are of great ac∣count, for their Kings Holy-days coat is made of them.</P>
<P>This Country our General called <HI>Albion,</HI> from the White Banks which lye toward the Sea.</P>
<P>Before our departure thence, our General caused to be set up a Plate of Brass nailed to a Post, with her Majesties name and picture, and Arms on a Sixpence, the day and year of our Arrival, and of their resigning the Kingdom into Her Majesties hands, as a Mo∣nument of Her Majesties Right and Title to that Kingdom.</P>
<P>And now the time of our departure ap∣proaching, those People, who had formerly so much joy in our Company, were now sorrowful and dejected beyond all measure, all their former joy being metamorphosed
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>
into Mourning at the report of our de∣parture.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 23. They took a sorrowful Wel∣fare of us, entreating us to remember them in our absence, and to return to them, and im∣mediately ran up to the tops of the Hills to keep sight of us as long as they could, making Fires on all hands. Near this place lye some Islands, which we called the Islands of St. <HI>James,</HI> where we had a great many Seals and Birds.</P>
<P>Our General now considering, that the cold encreased, the Sun being now nearer the South, left off his design of finding passage through the Northern parts, and therefore with consent of the rest bent his Course for the <HI>Moluccaes</HI> and sailed without sight of Land for 68 days space, and <HI>Sept.</HI> 30. came to some Islands, lying in 8 deg. North. Lat. As soon as we were perceived, a great number of Canows came towards us, bringing with them Coquo's, Fish, Po∣tato's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Canows, as most of the <HI>Moluc∣caes</HI> are made of one Tree hollowed within with great art, very smooth; their Prow and Stern were of one fashion, yielding in∣ward, very high, and hanged full of gli∣stering shells; on each side their Canows
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>
lay out 2 pieces of Timber to keep them from overwhelming.</P>
<P>The People have the nether part of their ears cut round hanging down on their Cheeks; the Nails on some of their Fingers were an Inch long, and their Teeth black as Pitch, the colour whereof they use to renew with a certain Powder. The first Company of those Canows, began to Traffique with us peaceably, entreating us to go nearer the shore, that they might easilier prey upon us. But these passing away, others came that discovered their Natures, for when they got any thing in their hands, they would neither give recompence nor restore it; and being rejected for their bad dealing, they began to resent it, throwing stones at us which they had brought on purpose; whereupon our General caused let fly a great Gun; at the noise of which they, frightned, leapt out of their Canows into the Water, and diving under the Keel of their Boat stayed there till we were gone a good way from them, and then recovered their Canows and made hast to the shore. Notwithstanding we were af∣terwards troubled with others of the same gang, and could not be rid of them, till we made them smart. And so we left this Island <HI>Octob.</HI> 23. naming it the <HI>Island of Thieves,</HI> and <HI>Octob.</HI> 16. fell with 4 Islands in 7 deg.

5 min. North. Lat. <HI>Octob.</HI> 21. we anchored at the biggest of them called <HI>Mindanao. Oct.</HI> 25. we passed by the Island <HI>Talao,</HI> and to the Northward of it saw 3 Islands, <HI>Teda, Selan, Saran:</HI> and <HI>Nov.</HI> 1. we past the Isle <HI>Suaro</HI> in 1 deg. 30 min. and <HI>Nov.</HI> 3. came in sight of the <HI>Moluccaes.</HI> They are 4 high picked Islands very fruithful, yielding abundance of Cloves. East from them lyes a great Island, called <HI>Gillola.</HI> We intended to go to <HI>Tidore,</HI> but coasting an Island of the King of <HI>Tere∣nat's</HI> his Deputy came off to us, who en∣treated our General to stay at <HI>Terenate,</HI> for that his King would be glad of his coming, and would assist him to his utmost Power, whereas if he went to <HI>Tidore,</HI> (inhabited by <HI>Portugals)</HI> he would find them deceitful; and besides, that then his King would not re∣ceive us, as being at enmity with them. Hereupon our General next Morning came to an anchor there, and sent a Messenger to the King, with a Velvet Cloak for a present: signifying to him, that he desired to be sup∣plyed with necessaries, for which he would give him other goods, and likewise that it was by persuasion of his Viceroy that he came thither. But before this the Viceroy had spoke to the King on our behalf, shewing how beneficial an Alliance with us would be to him, and how discouraging to
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>
his Enemies. Whereupon the King imme∣diately sent the Viceroy with others of his Nobles to our General, to shew him that he was ready to do any thing for us that lay in his power, upon our Prince's account; and that he would shortly visit us in our Ship. By that time they came to us, our Messengers were at Court, who were honorably con∣ducted to the King, and most Graciously by him entertained. Whereupon the Prince hastened his before promised visit; the manner of his coming was thus:</P>
<P>First, he sent before 3 great Canows wherein were some of his Nobles of all ages, attired all in white Lawn, or Cloath of Ca∣lecute, but with some difference, their Canow covered from one End to t'other with fine Mats, bore up by a frame of Reeds.</P>
<P>The rest were Souldiers standing orderly on both sides, without whom were the Ro∣wers, in 3 Galleries on each side, lying off the side 3 or 4 yards, one built lower than the other; in each of which Galleries was a like number of Banks that the Rowers sate upon: On the forepart of each Canow sate 2 men, one holding a Tabret, the other a piece of Brass, who striking therewith by the sound directed the Rowers to keep their Strokes; and the Rowers ending their Strokes with a song, gave warning to the others to strike
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>
again. They had in each Canow one small Piece; besides every man had his Sword, Dagger, and Target, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These Canows coming near our Ship rowed round us one after another, and the men as they passed did us homage, the greatest Persons beginning; afterwards putting our Messenger aboard, they told us that their King had sent them before him to conduct our Ship into a better Road.</P>
<P>Not long after the King came up with 6 grave Fathers and did obeysance to us in humble manner. He was of a tall stature, Corpulent, of a Princely Countenance. His respect among his Subjects was very great, none of his Councillors daring speak to him but on their Knees.</P>
<P>We received him in best sort we could, as with discharging of Ordinance, and great store of small shot, sounding of Trumpets, and other Instruments of Musick, wherewith the King was extremely delighted. Be∣sides, our General gave him some presents. His Brother likewise made us a visit, and was also courteously entertained by our Ge∣neral. The King when we came to Anchor, departed, promising to come aboard next day, and in the mean time to send us necessaries: Which the same night and next morning we had by way of Traffique, as Hens, Rice,
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>
Sugar Canes, Liquid Sugar, a fruit they call <HI>Figo</HI> the same which the <HI>Portugals</HI> name <HI>Plantanes, Cocoes</HI> and a kind of Meal they call <HI>Sago,</HI> made of the tops of Trees, tasting like sour Curds, but melting like Sugar. The Inhabitants make a kind of Cake thereof which will keep good ten years: We had also some Cloves. Our General having all things provided, expected the King at the time appointed; who came not, but sent his Brother with his Apology, entreating our General to come a shore; that his Brother in the mean while should remain aboard as a pledge for his safety; but the Company would by no means permit him, especially for that his Brother had dropt some Words aboard which gave suspicion of ill intent. Our General therefore in his stead sent some of his Gentlemen with the Kings Brother to Court, detaining the Viceroy for a Pledge. They being come near the Castle were re∣ceived by another of the King; Brothers and Persons of Quality, and conducted honorably to the Castle; where being brought into a stately House, a great multitude was there, the greatest Persons being placed round the House according to their degrees, the rest remaining without.</P>
<P>The House was four square, covered with Cloath of diverse colours, born up on a
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>
Frame of Reeds, the sides being open, and furnished with seats round; this it seems was their Council House. At the side of this House next the Castle, was seated the Chair of State, with a large Canopy over it; the ground also for 10 or 12 paces round it was covered with Cloath of Arras. There were seated 60 Ancient Noblemen, of the Kings Council; at the nether end of the House, were a great Company of Young men in good attire; without on the right side of the House were 4 old men attired in long red Garments, their heads after the Turkish Fashion, who lived as Lidgiers there, to keep continual Traffique with this People, with several others of foreign Nations.</P>
<P>The King at last coming attended by 8 or 10 Grave Senators had a rich Canopy born over him, guarded with 12 Lances, the points downwards; our men With His Brother met him, and were graciously en∣tertained.</P>
<P>The Kings Attire was very sumptuous; From his Waste downwards was all rich Cloath of Gold, his Legs bare, on his Feet Shoes of Cordivant died red; on his Cap were diverse Rings of plated Gold, an Inch and a half broad; a great Chain of Gold about his Neck; on his left hand a Diamond,
<PB N="108" REF="58"/>
an Emerald, a Ruby and Turky; on his Right hand Rings set with rich Stones.</P>
<P>As he sate in his Chair of State, a Page stood by him with a Fan, richly embroy∣dered with Saphires. Our Gentlemen hav∣ing delivered their Message, and received answer were safely conducted back again.</P>
<P>The Castle was of no strength, there being only 2 Cannons there, and those un∣mounted, which were left by the <HI>Portugals</HI> by whom the Castle was built: Who by their Tyrannies exercised both on their King and People, which they did to confirm them∣selves, so incensed the People that they were forced to leave it with their furniture in it.</P>
<P>The People are <HI>Moors</HI> very superstitious in observations of New Moons, and Fastings; For on those days the Viceroy when aboard of us, would neither eat nor drink in the day, though in the Night he ate very largely.</P>
<P>While we stayed here a goodly Gentlemen of a discreet behaviour came aboard to view our Ship, and discourse our Captain. He was born in the Province of <HI>Baghia</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> whose Predecessors had reigned there 200 years. The Cause of his coming from home, was, that being accused of Treason, and tho innocent, yet could not make it appear,
<PB N="109" REF="58"/>
and knowing the strictness of the Law there, he petitioned the King that he would please to commit his Trial to Gods providence, and permit him to travel, with condition that if he brought not home some conside∣rable Intelligence, the King had never be∣fore heard of, he should die; the King gran∣ted his sute, and he had been now 3 years at <HI>Tidore.</HI> He earnestly entreated our General to declare unto him such if he could, and likewise all occurrences happening in his long and dangerous Voyage; wherein our General satisfied him; he likewise informing our General of all things worth notice in their Country, withal entreating him to go along with him to <HI>China,</HI> but our General could not be persuaded thereto.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 9. We set sail thence, and considering our Ship needed reparation we determined to seek for a convenient place for that pur∣pose, and <HI>Nov.</HI> 14. we arrived at an Island South of <HI>Celebes,</HI> in 1 deg. 40 min. South. Lat. which place being uninhabited gave us more encouragement; and so we anchored, and in dispatching our business spent 26 days.</P>
<P>The whole Island is overgrown with Wood; the Trees are large, high and straight, the leaves whereof are like our Broom; among these Trees were a multi∣tude
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
of Worms (no bigger than Flies) which by night did cast great light. There was here also a great number of Bats, of the Bigness of a Hen, with flie wonderfully swift, but their flight is short, and when they light they hang by the Boughs with their Backs downwards. There was here likewise a Kind of Cray Fish, of such size that one would satisfie 4 men, being very wholesom Food. They do not live in the Sea, but dig themselves caves under the roots of Trees, lodging by Companies; when we came to take them they climbed up Trees to hide themselves. This Island we called <HI>Crab Island. Dec.</HI> 12. We put to Sea, and on the 16 had sight of <HI>Celebes</HI> or <HI>Sillebis;</HI> but having a bad Wind, and being entangled with Islands, and other difficulties and dangers, we could not recover the North of <HI>Sillebis,</HI> or continue or course further West, but were necessitated to steer Southwards, finding that course very dangerous by reason of the many Shoals; and <HI>Jan.</HI> 9. when we thought we were past all danger, and had a prosperous Gale of Wind, of a Sudden, when we were sailing with full Sail, in the beginning of the first night Watch, our Ship was laid fast on a desperate Shoal; where we expected nothing but present death. Notwithstanding having first recommended
<PB N="111" REF="59"/>
our selves to God by prayer, we endeavoured to use the means, and in the first place plying our Pumps, we found the leak nothing encreased, which was some, tho small en∣couragement to us. Our next Essay was for good ground and anchor-hold to Seaward of us, whereon to hale, by which means, if by any, our General told us there was some hope left; but when we sounded, we found that even a Boats length from the Ship we could not find ground; so that our hopes quite vanished, and nothing but present death, or at least a lingring death was before us. In those fears and perplexities we spent this night; next morning we tryed to see if we could now find any Anchor-hold, but this succeeded no better than the former. But it pleased God miraculously to deliver us, so that we got clear of it.</P>
<P>This Shoal is 3024 Leagues in length, &amp; lyes in 1 deg. betwixt 56 and 57. min. South. Lat. This was the greatest danger we met with in our whole Voyage. Yet we were tossed with several storms for 3 weeks after. <HI>Jan.</HI> 12. being not able to bear Sail, we dropt our Anchors upon a Shoal in 3 deg. 30 min. <HI>Jan.</HI> 14. We again anchored at an Island in 4 deg. 6 min. South. Lat. After this we had foul Weather, so that we were weary of the Coast of <HI>Celebes.</HI> The farthest Cape of <HI>Ce∣lebes</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>
is in 5 deg. South Lat. <HI>Jan.</HI> 20. We were forced to run with a small Island not far thence, and sought for a place where we might anchor; when suddenly a storm arose out of the Southwest, whereby we were in fear of being cast away on a Lee shore; and had if the merciful Goodness of God had not wrought our delivery. Having escaped this danger we continued our course till 26 day, when, the winds arising, we could bear no sail till <HI>Feb.</HI> 1. At which time we saw very high land, and would willingly have got in there, but that the weather was so bad. <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. We saw a little Island, but could not fetch it. <HI>Feb.</HI> 6. We saw 5 Islands, one to the East and 4 to the West of us, at the biggest of which we anchored, and watred. <HI>Feb.</HI> 8. we departed thence, and descried 2 Canows, who having seen us before came willingly to us, conducting us to their Town, not far off named <HI>Baratina;</HI> it is in 7 deg. 13 min. South Lat.</P>
<P>The People are Gentiles, of handsom Body, comely Stature, civil Demeanor, just in dealing and courteous to Strangers. The men go naked save their Heads and Secret parts, having Pendules at their Ears. Their Women are covered from the middle to the Foot, wearing Bracelets upon their Arms, for most part of Horn or Brass, each at least weighing 2 Ounces. With this People
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>
Linnen Cloath is the best Merchandise, as also <HI>Margareta's</HI> and such other things.</P>
<P>Their Island is rich and Fruitful, aboun∣ding in Gold, Silver, Tin, Sulphur <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fruits are likewise plentiful as Nutmegs, Ginger, Long-Pepper <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here we spent 2 days, and departed, <HI>Feb.</HI> 10. In 8 deg. 4 min. <HI>Feb.</HI> 12. we espied a green Land to the Southward, and a little after 2 Islands on the same side, and one more on the North, all which we past: <HI>Feb.</HI> 14. we saw other big Islands; and <HI>Feb.</HI> 15 past between 4 or 5 big Islands in 9 deg. 40 min. <HI>Feb.</HI> 18. we anchored in a little Island, and departed next day. <HI>Feb.</HI> 22. we lost sight of some Islands on our Star-Board side. After this we steered Westward, seeing nothing considerable, till <HI>Mar.</HI> 9. in the morning we espied Land, some part thereof very high, in 8 deg. 20. min. and bearing farther North, <HI>Mar.</HI> 10. we anchored; we first took in Water, and afterwards sent our Boat ashore, and traffiqued with the People of the Country, and next day brought our Ship nearer the Town; our General sent Linnen and Woollen Cloath, and some Silks as a Present for the King, in requital whereof he returned Rice, Cocoes, Hens, and other Victuals. This Island we found to be <HI>Java,</HI> the middle whereof is in 7 deg. 30 min. South Lat.
<PB N="114" REF="61"/>
<HI>Mar.</HI> 13. Our General with others went ashore, and complemented the King with his Musick, shewing him likewise the manner of our exercising Arms; we were cour∣teously received, and dismissed with promise of more supplies.</P>
<P>In this Island there is one Chief but ma∣ny Under-Governors, whom they call <HI>Raias,</HI> who live in great love. <HI>Marc.</HI> 14. we re∣ceived Victuals from 2 of them, and on the 15. three of these petty Kings visited our Ge∣neral, who were highly satisfied with what they saw, and with our entertainment, and on their return related what they saw to <HI>Raia Donan</HI> the Chief King, who next day came aboard us, bringing Victuals with him for our relief. Few days past but one or more of these Kings visited us, so that we were acquainted with most of them; and our Ge∣neral always entertained them to the utmost of his Power; especially with our Musick wherewith they were extremely delighted. The People of this place, as also their Princes, are a loving, and just dealing People, which we found in our traffiquing with them.</P>
<P>Taking our leaves of them. <HI>Marc.</HI> 26. we set our course W. S. W. directly towards the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> and <HI>May</HI> 21. we espied a part of the Main of <HI>Africa.</HI> We coasted
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>
along till <HI>June</HI> 15. and past the Cape within shot of it. <HI>July</HI> 15. we fell with Land again about <HI>Rio de Sesto. Jul.</HI> 22. we came to <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> and watered in the Mouth of <HI>Tagoine,</HI> and put to Sea again; here we had Oisters and plenty of Lemmons. <HI>Aug.</HI> 15. we were under the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> having the Wind at N. E. and were 20 Leagues off land. <HI>Aug.</HI> 22. we were in the height of the <HI>Canaries.</HI> And <HI>Sept.</HI> 26. It pleased God we safely arrived at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> after we had spent 2 Years, 10 Months and odd days, in seeing the Wonders of the Lord in the Deeps, in discovering so admirable things, and escaping so many dangers and diffi∣culties in our encompassing the World.</P>

<P>We departed the 14. <HI>Sept.</HI> and being on that part of the Coast of Spain, called the <HI>Moors,</HI> we espied some Ships; The General sent the Vice-Admiral to see what they were; they being <HI>Frenchmen</HI> bound homewards with Salt, on sight thereof deserted most of their
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
Ships, and our General having a fancy for one of them, called the <HI>Drake,</HI> took her along with him, but payed for her at his return: The rest were dismissed. After∣wards putting off to Sea we met with more <HI>French</HI> Ships, returning with <HI>Newland</HI> Fish, whom our General, after speech with them dismissed, without doing them any hurt. The next day we descried another Ship of 240 Tun, and Mr. <HI>Carleil</HI> Lieut. Gen. took her; the Admiral coming up, the Master and principal Men of her were exa∣mined apart, and she was found to belong to <HI>Spain,</HI> tho most of the Seamen belonged to St. <HI>John de Luce;</HI> This Ship was laden with <HI>Newland</HI> Fish, (we call it <HI>Poor John)</HI> which was distributed amongst our Ships.</P>
<P>Two days after we put in at the Isles of <HI>Bayon,</HI> the winds crossing us, and anchored. But the General ordered all the Pinnaces and Ship-Boats to be manned, and every man to be furnished with sit Arms; which done, the General went into his Galley rowing towards the City of <HI>Bayon</HI> with in∣tent to surprise it; but we were met by an <HI>English</HI> Merchant, sent from the Go∣vernor to discover us; after our General had spoke with him, he sent Capt. <HI>Sampson</HI> with him to the Governor, desiring to be re∣solved
<PB N="119" REF="63"/>
of 2 Points: To wit, whether there were Wars between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England?</HI> And, why our Merchants were arrested. Our General with advice of the Lieut. Gen. purposed to get as near the City as they could, that upon Capt. <HI>Sampsons</HI> return, if need were, they might make a sudden at∣tempt before it were dark.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Sampson</HI> returned with this answer, That the Governor said he knew of no Wars; And as for the stay of the Mer∣chants, that it was the Kings pleasure, but with no intent to injure them, and that afterwards by the Kings Order they were discharged, for confirmation of which he sent such Merchants as were in Town of our own Nation: Upon which it was ad∣vised, that night to land our Force. The Governor sent us some refreshment. A∣bout midnight a Storm arising, we went aboard, and before we reached our Fleet, several of our Ships were driven from their Anchor Holds, of which one was driven back to <HI>England,</HI> but all the rest came up to us again. The Storm lasted three days, which being over our Lieut. Gen. was sent with his and 3 other Ships to <HI>Vigo,</HI> where he took many Boats, and some Carvels, laden with things of small Value, mostly Household Stuff, and among the rest
<PB N="120" REF="64"/>
he found one Boat laden with the principal Church-Stuff of the High-Church of <HI>Vigo,</HI> where also was their great Cross of Silver, of embossed Work, double gilt all over. All we had in this place amounted to 30000 Duckets. The next day the whole Fleet went up to a Harbor above <HI>Vigo,</HI> where the Lieut. Gen. stayed our coming. In the mean time the Governor of <HI>Galisia</HI> had raised 2000 Foot, and 300 Horse, and marched from <HI>Bayon</HI> to this place, and sent to parly with our General, which was grant∣ed; at their meeting it was agreed, that we should have Water and other Necessaries, paying for the same.</P>
<P>Afterwards we departed for the <HI>Canaries;</HI> and fell with <HI>Palma</HI> with purpose to have landed there, but by reason of the many Guns, that were planted there, which were discharged upon us, and other inconve∣niences, we were forced to alter our Reso∣lution, and determined to land in the Isle of <HI>Ferro;</HI> and when we had landed 1000 Men there, and stayed two days, the Inhabitants accompanyed with an <HI>Englishman,</HI> came to us, declaring their State to be so poor, that they were ready to starve; which was not untrue; and therefore that night we put to Sea again.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="64"/>
<HI>Nov.</HI> 13. We fell with Cape <HI>Blancke,</HI> and put into the Bay, where were some <HI>French</HI> Men of War, whom we entertained cour∣teously, and afterward departed to the Isles of Cape <HI>Verde,</HI> and <HI>Nov.</HI> 16. we saw the Island of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and in the Evening anchored the Fleet between <HI>Plaie</HI> or <HI>Prdie</HI> and St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and landed 1000 Men under the leading of the Lieut. General, who kept us marching till we came to a convenient Plain, and when we were all gathered there, he thought it best to make no attempt till day; after we had taken a little respite, he di∣vided the Army into three Parts. By that time we were well ranged daylight appear∣ed, and having advanced hard by the Wall, and seeing no Enemy to resist, the Lieut. Gen. ordered Capt. <HI>Sampson</HI> and Capt. <HI>Barton</HI> with 30 shot apiece, to enter the Town, which stood in the Valley under us, and after them was sent <HI>St. Georges</HI> Cross to be placed towards the Sea, to give advertise∣ment to our Fleet; and that day, being <HI>Nov.</HI> 17. all the great Ordnance about the Town, being above 50 Pieces was shot off in honour of our Queens Coronation day. In the mean while the Lieut. Gen. stayed upon the Hill with most of his Forces till the Town was quartered out for lodging the Army, which done every Captain took his
<PB N="122" REF="65"/>
own Quarter, and in the evening kept sus∣ficient Guard to prevent danger. Here we stayed 14 days taking such spoils as the place afforded, but found no Treasure.</P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>St. Jago</HI> is in Form like to a Triangle, having on the East and West sides 2 Rocky Mountains, on the top of which were built some Fortifications; one the South side is the Main Sea, and on the North a Valley between the aforesaid Mountains, the Valley and Town grow very narrow between the 2 Clifts. In the midst of the Valley cometh down a Brook of fresh Water, which hard by the Sea maketh a Pond very convenient for Wa∣tering. The Valley at the Towns End is wholly converted into Gardens, and Orchards, wherein are diverse sorts of Herbs, Fruits and Trees, among which are the Cocoes and Plantens; The Cocoes have a hard shell and green Husk over it, bigger than a mans 2 Fists; of the shell drinking Cups are made, within this shell is a white Rine resembling the White of an Egg when it is hard boyled, and within that a Water whitish and clear, about a half Pint, which are very cool, and as some say restorative. The Planten groweth in Cods like to Beans, but bigger, and when it is ripe, the meat of it becometh yellow, and is very pleasant.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="65"/>
While we abode here a <HI>Portugal</HI> came hither with a Flag of Truce, to whom Capt. <HI>Sampson</HI> and <HI>Goring</HI> were sent; as they came to him, he asked of what Nation they were, and being told, he asked if there were Wars between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they answered, our General could best satisfie him in that, and proffered him safe conduct if he would go to him; but he refused, pretending he was not sent by his Governor. Then they told him, that if his Governor would consult his own or his Countreys good, his best course were to present himself to our General, Sir <HI>Fancis Drake,</HI> whereby he might assuredly find favour, otherwise within 3 days we would march over the Land, and prosecute them with Fire and Sword.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 24. The Gen. Lieut. Gen. with 600 Men marched to <HI>Sancto Domingo,</HI> a Village 12 Miles within the Land, where the Go∣vernor, Bishop, and better sort lodged but found it abandoned.</P>
<P>After we had stayed a while, we marched homewards; as we were on our way, we saw the Enemy both Horse and Foot, though not of such Force as to encounter us.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 26. Our General ordered the Army to be embarqued into their Ships, and Capt. <HI>Goring</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Tucker,</HI> with 100 Foot
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>
were ordered to make a stand in the Market place, till our Forces were all embarqued, the Vice-Admiral waiting to take them aboard. And also our General ordered Capt. <HI>Sampson</HI> with a Party to seek out such Munition as was hidden in the ground at the Town of <HI>Praie,</HI> having been promised to be shewed it by a Prisoner taken the day before. When they came thither, the Prisoner failed of his pro∣mise; and they searching all suspected places, found a Piece of Ordnance of Iron, and an∣other of Brass. In the afternoon our General anchored the Fleet before <HI>Praie,</HI> and went ashore, and caused us burn the Town, and af∣terwards embarqued the same night, and put off to Sea Southwest.</P>
<P>Before our departure from St. <HI>Jago</HI> the Gen. administred the Oath of Supremacy to the Souldiers, as also an Oath for every man to do his utmost for the service of the Action, and to obey the Orders of the Gen. and his Officers.</P>
<P>All the time of our being here none of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came near us: the cause of which, we conjecture, was the fresh remembrance of Injuries they had done some of our Coun∣treymen, by reason whereof we left tokens of our discontent.</P>
<P>From hence we put over to the West<HI>-Indies,</HI> and in our way were afflicted with a

grievous distemper, whereof above 300 died in a few days: This sickness seised our People, with extream heat and a burning Ague; and those that escaped, suffered a great diminution in their strength and wits. In 18 days space we had sight of the Island of <HI>Dominica,</HI> which is inhabited by a savage People, who go all naked, their Skin is co∣loured with paint of a reddish Tawney; personable and strong men; they admit little converse with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet they used us very kindly, helping us with necessa∣ries; they brought us store of Tobacco, as also a kind of Bread, called <HI>Cassado,</HI> very white and savory, made of the Roots of <HI>Cassania;</HI> for which we gave them Glass, coloured Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we went to the Westwards of St. <HI>Christophers</HI> Island, where we spent some days of <HI>Christmass,</HI> but could see no Inhabitants. Here it was unanimously re∣solved, to proceed to <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> And by the way we met a small Frigat, bound thither, which we took, and having exa∣mined the Men, one of them informed us, that it was a barren Haven, and the Land well fortified with a Castle, so that we could not land within 10 Miles of the City; to which place he promised to conduct us.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="67"/>
Hereupon we went on all this night in our Voyage, and the General put himself into the Bark <HI>Francis,</HI> as Admiral, and in the Morning, we came to the aforesaid place, 10 Miles Westward of <HI>Domingo.</HI> When we were landed, our General returned to his Fleet, committing the Charge of us to the Lieut. Gen. We marched at 8 a Clock, and at Noon we approached the Town, where those of the better sort, about 150 Horse, began to present themselves, but we so played upon them with our small shot, that they soon retreated, so that we had leave to proceed towards the two Gates of the Town, that were next the Sea. They had manned them both, and planted their Ordnance, and also some Troops of small shot in <HI>Ambuscado</HI> by the way side. We di∣vided our whole Force, being 1200, to attack both the Gates.</P>
<P>Their Ordnance was no sooner discharged on us, doing but small execution, but our Lieut. Gen. advanced with all speed, to pre∣vent their recharging, and notwithstanding their <HI>Ambuscadoes,</HI> we quickly entred the Gates, and forthwith repaired to a spacious Square before the great Church; whither also came Capt. <HI>Powel</HI> with the other Party. This place we fortified and stayed here all day. After Midnight they that were in the
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>
Castle hearing us at the Gates, forsook it, some flying others taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>Next day we quartered through the Town, and kept this Town a Month. One day as we stayed here, the Gen. sent on Message to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a <HI>Negroe</HI> Boy, with a Flag of White; this Boy meeting unhappily with some <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they struck him through the Body with one of the Horsemen staves; the Boy notwithstanding returned to our General, and after he had declared it to him, died forthwith in his presence. Whereat our General was so incensed, that he caused two Friars, then Prisoners, to be led out to the same place and hanged, and also dis∣patcht a Messenger to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> de∣claring that unless the Party who had killed the Boy were delivered up, every day 2 Pri∣soners should be hanged so long as any were left. Whereupon the day following, he was brought to the Towns End to be delivered up, but our General ordered them to dispatch him: which they did.</P>
<P>During our abode here many Treaties past between them and us for Ransom of their City, but upon disagreement, all the morning we fired the outmost houses, which was hard to perform, they being strong stone Houses; and tho for 14 days 20 Ma∣riners spent the whole forenoon in firing
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>
Houses, yet not one third part of the Town was consumed, so that in end being weary of this, we were content to accept of 25000 Duckets (5 s. 6. d. <HI>per</HI> Ducket) as a Ransom for the rest of the Town. I cannot omit the relation of a notable instance of the in∣satiable ambition of the <HI>Spanish King:</HI> As we entred his House there, over against us we spied a large Scutcheon, the Kings Arms; in the lower part thereof is described the Globe of the Earth, and a Horse standing, his hinder part within the Globe, and his fore∣part without, lifting up as it were to leap, with this Motto: <HI>Non sufficit Orbis, The World is not enough.</HI> Which some of the wiser <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they were treating with us, were even ashamed of.</P>
<P>Now tho this is naturally a rich Place yet we had no Treasure here. The reason is, be∣cause the <HI>Indians</HI> were long ago consumed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Tyranny, and for lack of People to work, the Golden and Silver Mines are quite given over, instead thereof using Copper. Their Chief Trade con∣sisteth of Sugar, Ginger, and Hides of Oxen and Kine, bred here in infinite Numbers and of vast bigness. Here also we had Plenty of strong Wine, sweet Oyl, Vinegar, Olives, Excellent Wheat Meal packed up in Wine Pipes, Woollen and Linnen Cloath, Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="68"/>
all which were brought out of <HI>Spain.</HI> We found but little Plate, because they use much <HI>China</HI> Wair.</P>
<P>Hence we put over to the <HI>Main</HI> Land, and came in sight of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> standing hard by the Sea. The Harbor Mouth lyes 3 Miles Westward from the Town, which we entred about 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. In the Evening we landed near the Harbor Mouth, under the Leading of our Lieut. Gen. and afterwards about Midnight mar∣ched forwards easily, keeping close by the Sea side. But as we came within 2 Miles of the Town, their Horsemen met us, and taking the Alarm, retired upon the first Vol∣ley of our shot.</P>
<P>At this time we heard some Pieces of Ar∣tillery discharged, with small shot towards the Harbor, whereby we understood, that, according to our Generals order the Night before, the Vice-Admiral, with Captain <HI>Venner,</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> and <HI>Crass</HI> &amp;c. with Boats and Pinnaces did attacque the little Fort on the Entry of the inner Haven, though to small purpose. In which attempt the Vice-Admiral had the Rudder of his Skiff shot through.</P>
<P>The Troops being now in their March half a Mile this side the Town, the Ground grew streight having the Main Sea on one
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>
side, and the Harbour on the other. This streight was fortifyed with a stone Wall, and Ditch. There was only so much unwalled, as might serve for passage, and that was well Barricado'd. This Wall had 6 great Pieces planted on it, which shot directly on our Front. On the inner side of the Streight, they had brought 2 Gallies to the Shore, where∣in they placed 11 Pieces of Ordnance and 400 small shot, which Flanked our coming on, and on the Land side in the Guard only of this place 300 shot and Pikes. They discharged many shot both great and small, but our Lieut. Gen. approached by the lowest ground, so that most of their shot was in vain; he also forbid us to shoot till we were come to the Wall side. The first place we came to was the Barricado's, where we dis∣charged our shot just on our Enemies Faces, and joyned with them, and made them quickly retire; Our Lieut. Gen. slew the Chief Ensign Bearer of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> We followed them into the Town, and won the Mercate place. At every Streets End they had made Barricado's, but we quickly took them with small loss. They had set <HI>Indians</HI> in several corners with poysoned Arrows; they had also stuck small sticks sharply poin∣ted, and poysoned, in the ground in our way; but we coming close by the shore shunned most of them.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="69"/>
We stayed here 6 Weeks, and the Sickness aforesaid still continued; Few escaping, and those that did escape, scarce ever recovered their strength, or their wits; so that when any spoke foolishly, it was usual to say he had been sick of a Calenture; The cause of it was supposed to be the Evening Air (they term it <HI>La Serena)</HI> which they say produces this distemper to any then abroad who is not a Native. By reason hereof we gave over our design for <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> where all the Treasure was, and thought of returning home.</P>
<P>While we were here one day our Watch espied 2 small Barks at Sea making towards the Harbor; Whereupon Capt. <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Varney</HI> with others embarqued themselves in 2 Pinnaces; that they might take them be∣fore they knew of our being there; but they having notice of it ran themselves ashore, and the men hid themselves in Bushes: Our men immediatly boarded them, and were suddenly shot at by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of the Bushes; whereby Capt. <HI>Varney</HI> died presently, and Capt. <HI>Moon</HI> died of his Wounds some days after; and so we returned disappointed, having had but few men, far inferior to them in Number.</P>
<P>In this time diverse Courtesies past be∣tween the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and us, and among
<PB N="132" REF="70"/>
others, the Governor, and Bishop of <HI>Car∣tagena</HI> with others came to visit our General.</P>
<P>We began to fire this City as we had done others, but at last they ransomed it for 110000 Duckets. A far greater Ransom than <HI>Domingo,</HI> because it is a Place of grea∣ter Traffique (whereas the other is chiefly inhabited by Lawyers and Gentlemen, being the chiefest Court of Judicature of the Islands about it.) Yet having warning of our coming they had carried away their Treasure and principal Substance. The Ransom aforesaid being only mentioned for the Town, on payment thereof we left it, and drew part of our Souldiers into the Abby a quarter of a Mile below the Town, on the Harbor. Whereupon they offered us a Ransom for the Abby and the Castle on the Mouth of the Harbor; and when we asked alike for both; they proffered us 1000 Crowns for the Abby, and to dispose of the Castle as we pleased; and therefore we delivered them the Abby, and blew up the Castle, and so departed to our Ships, which in the mean while were making all preparations for their Voyage. This Island is very fruitful, bearing many pleasant Fruits; it is but 2 or 3 Miles about. After 6 Weeks stay here we put to Sea, and 2 or 3 days after our Ship we had taken at <HI>St. Do∣mingo,</HI> fell into a great leak, and lost Com∣pany
<PB N="133" REF="70"/>
of us; but next Morning our General missing her cast about, and at last found her in great distress: whereupon we returned to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> where she was unladed, and her Goods and Men disposed in other Ships: after which we departed, and arrived at Cape St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and finding no Water there, we put to Sea; but were forced to return; and then our scarcity of Water being greater we were more diligent in seeking af∣ter it, and had it in abundance: In taking in of which our General wrought as hard as the meanest of his Company, to his unspeakable Praise. After 3 days we departed, and touched no where, but coasted along <HI>Florida,</HI> and <HI>May</HI> 28. we saw a place, on the Shore built like a Beacon in 30 deg. We manned our Pinnaces, and went ashore, and marched up the River side, to see what place the Enemy held, our General marched with the Com∣panies, the Lieut. Gen. led the Vantguard, and when we had gone a Mile, we saw a Fort on the other side the River, built by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and a little Town without Walls 3 Miles above it. We prepared Ordnance for the Battery, and about Evening our Lieut. Gen. shot off a Piece, which stroke through their Ensign. In the Night the Lieut. Gen. took a little Rowing Skiff, and 12 men well Armed, as Capt. <HI>Morgan, Sampson,</HI> and
<PB N="134" REF="71"/>
others, to view what Guard the Enemy kept; the Enemy seeng him come, took the Alarm, and being fearful, that all our Force was coming, abandoned the Place when they had shot off some Pieces. Where∣of a <HI>Frenchman</HI> (a Prisoner) informed us; Thereupon our Gen. and Lieut. Gen. with some Souldiers, put over to the Fort. In our approach some that stayed behind shot off 2 Pieces; yet we entred, finding no man there. We found here 14 great Pieces of Brass Ordnance, and of Money to the Value of 2000 l. Next day we essayed to go to the Town, but could not by reason of Rivers and broken ground, and therefore were forced to go up the River in our Pinnaces. When we approached the Land, they dis∣charged some shot on us, and presently with∣drew. And the Serjeant Major finding one of their Horses ready, mounted, and followed the Chase, and outrunning his Company he was shot through the Head, and after∣wards stabbed in several parts of his Body by others, to our great Grief. In this Place, called St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> the King kept 150 Souldiers, and at St. <HI>Helena,</HI> 12 Miles Northward the same number, to keep other Nations from inhabiting any part of that Coast. Here it was resolved to assault St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and then to seek out our Countrey∣men
<PB N="135" REF="71"/>
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in their Plantation distant thence 6 deg. Northwards. But when we came by St. <HI>Helena,</HI> the Shoals appearing dangerous, and we having no Pilot that would undertake to guide us, durst not ha∣zard in, but coasted along, and <HI>June 9th.</HI> on sight of a great Fire, the General sent his Skiff to the shore, where they found some <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and brought them aboard, who directed us to their Port. But some of our Ships being of great draught, we anchored all two Miles from the shore. Our General wrote to Mr. <HI>Ralph Lane</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Go∣vernor, shewing how ready he was to supply their Necessities. Next day Mr. <HI>Lane</HI> with others coming to him, our Capt. proffered either to leave a Ship, a Pinnace, and some Boats, with sufficient Masters and Mariners, with a Months Victuals to stay and make further discovery of the Country, and so much, as would bring them into <HI>England</HI> after such time, if they thought fit; Or if they desired to return into <HI>England</HI> now, he would give them Passage; they accepted the former. Whereupon the Ship being received into Charge by some of their own Com∣pany, before they had received their Pro∣vision a storm arose, and continued 3 days, which put all our Fleet in disorder, besides the loss of Anchors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that Ship was
<PB N="136" REF="72"/>
driven quite away, and never saw us again till we came to <HI>England,</HI> with several other losses Notwithstanding our General pro∣ffered them another Ship, tho not so good as the other, nor the same Provision. Where∣upon Mr. <HI>Lane,</HI> requested our General, that they might have passage for <HI>England;</HI> which being granted, and the rest sent for out of the Country, and shipped, we depart∣ed that Coast <HI>June</HI> 18. and arrived safely at <HI>Plimouth, July</HI> 28. 1586.</P>
<P>The total Value of what we got in this Voyage was 60000 <HI>l.</HI> whereof the Compa∣nies that travelled in the Voyage were to have 20000 <HI>l.</HI> the Adventurers the other 40000.</P>
<P>We lost 750 Men in the Voyage.</P>
<P>The Men of note that died were, Capt. <HI>Powel,</HI> Capt. <HI>Varney,</HI> Capt. <HI>Moon,</HI> Capt. <HI>For∣tescute,</HI> Capt. <HI>Bigges,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cecil,</HI> Capt. <HI>Hannam,</HI> Capt. <HI>Greenfield: Tho.

In the 37. Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth, Aug.</HI> 28. 1595. We embarked at <HI>Plimouth;</HI> thence we sailed towards the <HI>Grand Canadoes,</HI> and <HI>Sept.</HI> 6. we espied a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, in the Northern Cape, whom we overtook.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 9. We espied 20 <HI>French</HI> Men of War, who chased us, but could not fetch us up, and therefore left us.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 25. We descried 2 Islands, <HI>Hamseroth,</HI> and <HI>Forta-Fontura,</HI> both standing W. and by S. in 28 deg. distant one from the other, 4 or 5 Leagues, and from the Grand <HI>Cana∣does</HI> 10 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 26. We anchored in that part of <HI>Canadoes</HI> otherwise called, St. <HI>John Decrus,</HI> where we endeavoured to get to Land in small Boats, but the Enemy knowing our design, entrench'd themselves at the place where we should have landed, discharging their great and small shot from the Town and Castle, forcing us to retire with loss of men, the Enemy being near 400.</P>
<P>The same day we departed to a Place where we watered; it lyes W. and by N. of this Town. The Inhabitants of it are <HI>Savages;</HI> and some of our Men stragling here were slain, and others bitten with Dogs, they keep on purpose to destroy strangers. This Island yields much <HI>Canadoe</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>
Wine, diverse sorts of Grain, Conies and Partridges. There is another Island (20 Leagues from this) called the <HI>Tenereffe</HI> a very high Land.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 28. We departed towards the West <HI>Indies,</HI> taking our course S. W. and by W. on the 29. we sailed S. W. and by S. the 30. S. W. the first of <HI>October</HI> W. and by S. the 13. W. in the height of 16 deg.</P>
<P>The 25 of this Month, the <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Adventure</HI> fell foul on each other, about ten at Night, they of the <HI>Adventure</HI> were forc'd to cut their Misson, and throw it over-board.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 27. We espied <HI>Martinino,</HI> an Island inhabited by a barbarous People, called <HI>Canibals;</HI> 10 Miles from this Island is another, called <HI>Dominica,</HI> where is much Tobacco; the people traffiqued with us in exchange for their Tabacco. The Weapons they use are Bows and Arrows, made of Reeds, with sharp Pieces of Braseil on the ends; they wear their Hair long, cut round by their Shoulders. <HI>Octob.</HI> 30. we came to <HI>Gordelowpa</HI> (distant from this ten Leagues) where are many Rivers issuing from the Mountains with great force into the Sea. From whence we sailed toward the River <HI>Della-Hatch,</HI> N. W. and by N. and <HI>Nov.</HI> 7. we descried three Islands of the <HI>Trigonies,</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>
viz. <HI>Mononalla, Rotmido,</HI> and <HI>Savoa. Nov.</HI> 10. we set sail for <HI>John de Portrizo,</HI> W. and by N.</P>
<P>These Islands (belong to <HI>Virginia)</HI> in some of their Harbours 1000 Ships may ride at Anchor. <HI>Novem.</HI> 12. we Anchored within 4 Miles of <HI>Portrizo,</HI> against a great Fort, where was placed a Piece of Ordnance, which plyed us divers times with shot. This day Sir <HI>John Hawkins</HI> died; The same night also (as Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Baskerfield,</HI> and others sate at supper,) Sir <HI>Nicholas Clifford,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stratford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brut Browne,</HI> were wounded with the same Piece of Ordnance from the Fort; and as Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> was drinking a Cup of Beer, his Stool was struck from under him, but he received no hurt; Sr. <HI>Nicholas Clifford</HI> died instantly of his Wounds. The same night also we went against the Town, and Anchored.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 13. Our General called a Council. Next Night 500 Men went with Shot and Fire-works to burn the 5 Men of War, which rode within the Harbor, one of which held 400 Tun, the rest smaller. In this Ship was planted much Ordnance, be∣sides small shot, which played on our Men, and also great store of shot from the shore. Tho we were no Gainers by this assault, as
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>
having lost a Ship and several Men, yet it was a valiant attempt. All those that were in that great Ship were slain and drowned save 4. we took up: They told us, that by reason they had notice of our coming our design was marred: they told us also, that this Town had in it 3000000 of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Treasure: and that they kept our Men they had taken in the <HI>Little Francis,</HI> whereupon our General wrote to the Go∣vernor to use them civilly. This Town stands on a small Island, encompassed with the Sea on one side, and a great. River on the other.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 15. Sir <HI>Jo. Hawkins,</HI> and Sir <HI>Nich. Clifford</HI> were thrown over Board: the same day we espied a <HI>Spanish</HI> Carvel, coming towards St. <HI>Jo. de Portricho,</HI> and our General sent off some men to take her, but those in the Castle perceiving it shot off a Piece, whereby they had warning, and ran ashore. <HI>Nov.</HI> 16. We departed thence, and sailing 36 Leagues, came to St. <HI>Jermans</HI> Bay: there we landed some Companies to Guard the Carpenters that built out Pinnaces. Near this is a House, called an <HI>Ingeneroide,</HI> where Sugar is made. This day Captain <HI>Brut</HI> died.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 23. <HI>John Standly</HI> was had before a Court Marshall. <HI>Nov.</HI> 22. Sir <HI>Tho. Baskerfield</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>
took 2 men of this Island a <HI>Negroe</HI> and <HI>Cle∣meronne: Nov.</HI> 24. the Ship, the <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Frollony</HI> of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> was burnt in the Bay: the same day we departed for <HI>Crusao,</HI> distant from St. <HI>Jermans</HI> 150 Leagues, &amp; stayed but three or four Hours. <HI>Nov.</HI> 29. we espied the Main Land, called the <HI>West-Indies</HI> N. N. E. from us, we sailed along the Coast to <HI>Della Hatch,</HI> and the same day anchored with∣in 10 Leagues of it. <HI>Dec.</HI> 2. We sailed to the Town all that day, and entred it at one a Clock at Night, the Enemy had Fled, leaving about 12 Souldiers in the Town, who gave us a Volley, and then all Fled save 2 we took Prisoners. They had carried all away, so that we found nothing in the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 3. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> parlyed with us for a certain Sum to ransom the Town, and on the 4th, they brought Pearl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but less in value than we compounded for; our Ge∣neral refused it, and ordered to burn the Town, which was accordingly done, at our departure. <HI>Dec.</HI> 16. the Governor came to Parly: our Men went to seek for Victuals, and met with the Governor. We took more Prisoners, and found some of their Goods and carried them away. At our departure we lest the Town all on Fire, save a Religious House not finished, and another House the Trea∣sury
<PB N="144" REF="76"/>
used to be kept in. In it we found some of their Treasure and Merchandise. This Country yieldeth store of Cattle and Fowl. The People are <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Negroes,</HI> they are wild and savage People, (save those the <HI>Spaniards</HI> keep in Subjection) and War against the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> There is a Moun∣tain 10 Leagues, hence whereon Snow re∣maineth constantly. <HI>Dec.</HI> 19. we came to <HI>Sancta Martha;</HI> the Inhabitants had Fled to the Mountains, but we pursued them into the Woods, and found some Treasure; the same day we took the Governors Deputy. <HI>Dec.</HI> 20. we departed, leaving it on Fire; we were told, that we were within 3 Leagues of a Gold Mine.</P>
<P>On Christmass day we sailed to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and on the <HI>27th.</HI> anchored before it; this day the Serj. Major died. We landed our Men a Mile from the Town, and mar∣ched towards it; the Enemy gave us a Bra∣vadoe of shot and fled into the Woods, their Goods and Treasure being sent before. They had but 3 Pieces of Ordnance, and one of them broke with a shot. We found some Treasure in the Woods. Our General had notice of the Governors going to <HI>Panama,</HI> and Sir <HI>Tho. Baskerfield</HI> went with 500 Men to surprize him; in this journey we were in great Hazard of our
<PB N="145" REF="76"/>
Lives, we went but 9 Miles, and could get no farther, being stopt by a Fort the Enemy had on the Top of a Rock through which we behoved to march; the Passage was so narrow that but one man at once could go up, so that we were forced to retire with loss. Several both Commanders and Soldiers were hurt. Returning to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> we saw it all on Fire, and thereupon hasted to our Ships. In this March a Pair of Shoes were sold for 30 s. and a Bisket Cake for 10 s. our want was so great.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 5. We departed, and on the <HI>10th.</HI> came to <HI>Scoday,</HI> it is N. and by W. from <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI> the same day we chased a <HI>Spanish</HI> Frigat, and on the <HI>11th</HI> brought it to our General. The same day our General commanded all our sick Men to be carried ashore, and to be lookt to in best sort we could. <HI>Jan.</HI> 22. We departed back towards <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and came to <HI>Porta Vella Jan.</HI> 27. on which day Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> died, whose Death was much lamented. His In∣terment was thus: His Corps being laid in a Coffin of Lead, he was let down into the Sea, the Trumpets in doleful manner soun∣ding all the while, and all the Cannons in the Fleet were discharged. We stayed here till <HI>Feb.</HI> 8. In this Harbor they were beginning to build Houses again. The day before we departed the Enemy took 6 of our

Men. <HI>Feb.</HI> 18. we departed hence, we took our course for <HI>Gemico</HI> North and by West. <HI>Feb.</HI> 2. we descried some Islands called <HI>Gourdanes,</HI> distant from <HI>Porta Vella</HI> 200 Leagues, and West from <HI>Gemico.</HI> To the East they are high Land, to the West low; we sailed to the Cape of <HI>Co∣renthus; Feb.</HI> 27. we passed the Shoals to the West of this low Land, one of our Ships being in danger, and <HI>Mar.</HI> 1. we saw 20 of the Kings Men of War, and af∣terwards fought with them 2 Hours, and worsted them: we plyed the Vice-Ad∣miral so hard, that if she had not fled, she had sunk; and another that was with her, her Powder took Fire. Next day we sailed to Cape St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> Thirteen of them following us, when they came nigh us, we sent 2 Ships to them, but they made away. <HI>May</HI> 4. we came to St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> distant from Cape <HI>Corenthus</HI> 18.

<HEAD>A Brief RELATION <HI>Of</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Invasion.</HEAD>
<P>TO conclude, we shall give you a Brief account of the defeat of the <HI>Spanish Ar∣mado,</HI> being this worthy Gentlemen served in Her Majesties Fleet set out against it.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI> being importuned by the Pope, and some <HI>English</HI> Fugitives to attempt a conquest of <HI>England,</HI> entred into consul∣tation about the manner of it: The Marquess of St. <HI>Cruce,</HI> who was to command the <HI>Ar∣mado,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> were for first surprizing some Sea Port Town in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Zealand.</HI> But others alledged that it would be easier to seize some Port in <HI>England,</HI> which latter was approved of. And in order thereto he set forth the <HI>Armado,</HI> being in
<PB N="148" REF="78"/>
all 130 Ships, containing 57808 Tun, wherein were 845 Mariners, 19295 Soul∣diers and 2088 Galley Slaves: and were pro∣vided with 220000 of Bullets and great Shot, of Powder 4200 Kintals, (each Kintal 100 <HI>l.</HI> weight) of Lead for Bullets 1000 Kintals, of Match 1200 Kintals, 7000 Musquets, 10000 Halberts and Partizans, with store of Murthering Pieces, Double Cannon and Field Pieces, with all other Provisions necessary for accomplishing their design.</P>
<P>The Marquess of <HI>Sancta Cruce</HI> dying, <HI>Don Lodovicos Peros</HI> Duke of <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> was made General in his Place: <HI>Joh. Mar∣tinez de Richalde</HI> was Admiral; <HI>Don Fran∣cisco Bovadille</HI> Mareschal: <HI>Don Martin Al∣caron</HI> was Vicar-General for the Inquisition, attended with 100 Jesuites: Cardinal <HI>Allen</HI> was appointed Superintendent of Ecclesiasti∣cal Affairs in <HI>England.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> also built flat bottomed Ships in <HI>Flanders,</HI> for carrying of Horses, with Bridges fitted to ship and unship the Horses: he set men at work to make the River navigable from <HI>Antwerp</HI> to <HI>Gaunt</HI> and <HI>Bridges,</HI> and laded 300 Boats with Munition and Victuals: 200 more not so big as the former lay ready at <HI>Newport</HI> Haven, and 37 Men of War at
<PB N="149" REF="78"/>
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with all other Provisions requisite to carry on the design.</P>
<P>He had lying near <HI>Newport</HI> under the Command of <HI>Camillo</HI> 30 Companies of <HI>Ita∣lians,</HI> 2 of <HI>Walloons,</HI> and 8 of <HI>Burguignons.</HI> At <HI>Dyxmew</HI> he mustered 80 Companies of <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> 60 of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and 60 of <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> and 700 Fugitive <HI>English</HI> com∣manded by Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> who were in great contempt: Nor was <HI>Stanley,</HI> nor the Earl of <HI>Westmorland</HI> and others, who offered their service, heard, but barred all access and rejected, as Traiters to their Countrey. At <HI>Conick</HI> also he had 4000 and at <HI>Watene</HI> 900 Horse commanded by the Marquess of <HI>Guast.</HI></P>
<P>To this Land service came the Duke of <HI>Pastrana,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s supposed <HI>Base</HI> Son, the Marquess of <HI>Bourgon,</HI> one of Duke <HI>Ferdinands</HI> Sons, with others of like Quality.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> was very forward in this design, dispersing his Indulgences and Pardons to all that contributed thereto: and promised likewise to give a Million of Gold, the one half presently, the other when any notable Haven in <HI>England</HI> should be won: but with this <HI>Proviso,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> should be held as Feudatory to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> hearing of these great Preparations, having first represented her
<PB N="150" REF="79"/>
case to God, and implored his Protection, she provided what force she could.</P>
<P>The Charge of her Navy she committed to <HI>Charles Howard</HI> of <HI>Effingam</HI> Lord Ad∣miral of <HI>England:</HI> Her Vice-Admiral was the Famous Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> who were sent to the West of <HI>England.</HI> She appoint∣ed <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Seimour,</HI> second Son to the Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> to lye upon the Coasts of <HI>Flanders</HI> with 40 Ships, to prevent the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI>'s joyning his strength with the <HI>Armado.</HI> She ordered the Land-forces to be mustered, appointing <HI>Duilley</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> Lieut. 20000. whereof were dispo∣sed along the South Coast. She had also 2 Armies; one consisting of 1000 Horse and 22000 Foot, encamped near the Mouth of the Thames; where the Enemy purposed to land; the other led by the <HI>L. Hunsdon</HI> con∣sisting of 34000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, which were to guard her Person.</P>
<P><HI>Arthur</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Knolles,</HI> Sir <HI>Rich Bingham,</HI> and Sir <HI>Roger Williams,</HI> were appointed to consult for Managing the Land service. They advised that all com∣modious landing Places should be manned and fortified; and that the Trained Bands throughout the Coast shires should meet upon signal given to hinder the Enemies Landing. And in case they should land, that they
<PB N="151" REF="79"/>
should lay all the Countrey about Waste, that the Enemy might have no Food but what they brought from their Ships, and that they should continually busy the Enemy with Alarms, but not hazard a Battle till greater Force were got together.</P>
<P>Some also suggested that the Papists at home were more to be feared than the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> abroad; whereupon some of them were imprisoned. Directions also were sent to the Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> how to demean himself in this imminent danger.</P>
<P>In the midst of these Preparations, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to cast a mist over her Majesties Eyes, importuned for a Peace, and at last prevailed so far, that a Treaty of Peace was entred upon, our Queen notwithstanding Resolving to treat with her Sword in her Hand. And in <HI>Febr.</HI> she sent her Com∣missioners into <HI>Flanders,</HI> to treat with the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> who pretended a Com∣mission for that effect, but they were delayed from time to time, and when they proposed any thing, by one pretence or other it was delayed, till at last they heard of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleets being near <HI>England,</HI> at which time they, having safe conduct from the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> were glad to return in safety.</P>
<P>This <HI>Armado,</HI> which had the Popes spe∣cial Blessing, in token of its holy Warfare,
<PB N="152" REF="80"/>
had 12 of its Ships called by the names of the 12 Apostles, their Ships being of such size that they floated like Castles upon the Waves, set sail <HI>May</HI> 20. out of the River <HI>Taye,</HI> steering its course towards the <HI>Groin</HI> in <HI>Galizia,</HI> the Place appointed for assembling, but whilest they were sailing thither, a storm arose, whereby they were dispersed, several of them were disabled, besides 3 <HI>Portugal</HI> Gallies, which were driven on the Coasts of <HI>Bayon</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and by the valor of one <HI>David Guin</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Slave, and the help of other Slaves were delivered into the hands of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>About the same time the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, in all about 100 Ships, whereof 15 were Vi∣ctuallers and 9 Voluntiers of <HI>Devonshire</HI> Gentlemen, hearing that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were ready to sail, set forth of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to meet and fight them by the way, but before they reached the <HI>Syllies,</HI> they were driven back by tempest to <HI>Plimouth;</HI> only some of their Scouts descried some of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, that were dispersed.</P>
<P>News being brought that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in distress, the Lord Admiral <HI>Howard</HI> taking advantage of the first fair Wind, lanched forth, <HI>July 8th,</HI> and bore his Sails almost within sight of the Coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> purposing to surprize their Ships; but the
<PB N="153" REF="80"/>
Wind suddenly turning South, and he, wisely foreseeing the disadvantages of his staying there, returned to <HI>Plimouth.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time it was confidently report∣ed, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet could not set forth that Year: and our Queen was so confident thereof, that she ordered 4 of her biggest Ships to be brought to <HI>Chatham:</HI> but our Admiral foreseeing the hazard of it, wisely retarded it; which was a singular Provi∣dence, for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet entred the <HI>Channel, July 11th,</HI> where Anchoring, they sent to the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> to signifie their Arrival, and require him in the Kings name to for∣ward his Charge for that service.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20. At noon they were descried by the <HI>English;</HI> which was a surprizal to them, most of their Men being ashore. Never∣theless our undaunted Admiral towed forth such Ships as he could get in readiness into the Sea. When they were got out, they saw the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Ships with lofty Towers, in Front like a half Moon: they seemed to make for <HI>Plimouth,</HI> but yet steered their course by towards <HI>Calice,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> suffer∣ing them to pass by, that they might chase them in the Rear with a fore-right Wind.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 21. The <HI>English</HI> Admiral sent be∣fore him a Pinnace to denounce War by dis∣charging her Ordnance; himself following
<PB N="154" REF="81"/>
in the <HI>Ark Royal</HI> set upon (the Admiral he thought, but) <HI>Alonzo de Leva</HI>'s Ship, where they had a fierce Encounter. Soon after <HI>Drake, Hawkins,</HI> and <HI>Forbusher</HI> came up, playing with their Ordnance on the hindmost Squadron of the Enemies, commanded by <HI>Rechalde,</HI> who did all he could to stay his Men from flying, till his own Ship bat∣tered with shot with difficulty was drawn into the Main Fleet. At which time the Duke of <HI>Medina</HI> gathered together his Fleet, and kept on his intended course towards <HI>Callice,</HI> and caused them to gather them∣selves up close in form of a half Moon. But our <HI>English</HI> Admiral having maintained a hot fight for 2 hours, thought it best to de∣sist the pursuit, there being not above 30 of their Ships come up yet. In this fight the <HI>Katharine</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship, being sorely battered, was taken into the midst of the Fleet to be repaired; And an huge Ship <HI>Biscaie</HI> of <HI>Don Oquendo</HI>'s, in which was a great part of the Kings Treasure, was fired by a <HI>Flemish</HI> Gunner, for being misused by them; but the Fire was quickly quenched. All this while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> declined fight∣ing, walling in the rest with their strongest Ships, in which posture they made a flying March towards <HI>Calice:</HI> and a great Gallion, wherein was <HI>Don Pedro de Valdez, Vasquez</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="81"/>
<HI>de Silva, Alenzo de Saias,</HI> and other Noble∣men, being battered with <HI>English</HI> shot, in avoiding it fell foul of another Ship, where∣by she lost her Fore-mast, and could not keep up with the rest, and was cast behind. But night coming on, our Admiral past her, sup∣posing there was nothing left in her, and fearing to lose sight of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he followed the Lanthorn of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which he thought was carried, as was ap∣pointed, by Sir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> but he was pursuing 2 Ships he thought <HI>Spanish,</HI> but when he came up to them, he found they were Friends, and so dismissed them. Yet by this mistake of his the greatest part of the Fleet wanting his light was forced to lye still so that he and the rest could not fetch up our Admiral till next day.</P>
<P><HI>July 22th</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> espied the aforesaid Gallion, and sent forth a Pinnace to command them to yield: <HI>Valdez</HI> answered that they were 430, and himself was <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and stood on his honour: the other replyed if he did not yield forthwith, he should know <HI>Drake</HI> was no <HI>Dastard; Pedro</HI> hearing that it was Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> in∣stantly yielded himself, and coming aboard Sir <HI>Francis</HI> Ship protested, they would have died, before they had yielded to any save him, whom <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Neptune</HI> alwaies at∣tended,
<PB N="156" REF="82"/>
and whose civility to the Conquered had often been experienced. Sir <HI>Francis</HI> to requite his Complements, placed him at his own Table, and lodged him in his own Cabine; the rest he sent to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where they remained Prisoners till their Ransom was paid. The same day <HI>Michael de Oquendo</HI> Vice-Admiral of the Fleet, his Ship was on Fire, the upper part of it being burnt; but the Gunpowder in the hold not taking Fire, the Ship fell into the Hands of the <HI>English,</HI> and was carried in to <HI>Plimouth.</HI> All this day the Admiral spent in setting his Fleet in order, appointing every Ship his Station, commanding them, on pain of Death not to desert it, and sent one to the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> to acquaint him with his Condition.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 23. early the <HI>Spaniards</HI> taking the benefit of a Northerly Wind turned about against the <HI>English;</HI> but the <HI>English</HI> being nimbler than they turned Westwards, and quickly recovered the Wind of them, and all that day battered those Wooden Castles: The fight was variable, whilst on the one side the <HI>English</HI> bravely rescued the <HI>London</HI> Ships, and on the other the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> as stoutly delivered <HI>Richalde;</HI> most of the <HI>Spanish</HI> shot flew over the <HI>English</HI> without hurting them, but the <HI>English</HI> never discharged a
<PB N="157" REF="82"/>
shot on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> but did Execution. The <HI>English</HI> Admiral would not hazard a fight by grappling with them, as some had advised, knowing they had a strong Army in the Fleet, besides the strength of their Ships, which could not but at extreme disadvantage be boarded. This day besides other remar∣kable losses the Enemy sustained, a great <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship with other Smaller were taken by the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gathered themselves into a round, their greatest Ships standing outmost to guard the battered Ships.</P>
<P><HI>July 24th,</HI> the 4 great Galliasses fought with some <HI>English</HI> Ships, who galled the Ene∣my with their shot: But our Men wanting Powder, the Admiral sent some Ships to fetch supply. In the mean while it was ordered by a Council of War that the <HI>English</HI> Fleet should be divided into 4 Squadrons, and the Admiral was Chief, Sir <HI>Fracnis Drake</HI> led the <HI>2d,</HI> Capt. <HI>Hawkins</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Forbusher</HI> the <HI>4th.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July 25th,</HI> at the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> there was a sharp Encounter. The St. <HI>Ann,</HI> a <HI>Portugal</HI> Gallion was set upon by some <HI>English</HI> Fri∣gates, to whose rescue came 3 Galliasses, which the Admiral and Lord <HI>Tho. Howard</HI> charged so that they could scarce save her. It was reported, that this day the <HI>Spanish</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="83"/>
Admiral was grievously rent with great Ordnance, and had been near taken, had not 2 Ships come up to her; after whose com∣ing they set upon the <HI>English</HI> Admiral, but she made her escape. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral sent again to the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> to joyn his Fleet with them, and send them supply.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 26. the <HI>English</HI> Admiral to encourage his Captains bestowed the Order of Knight∣hood, on several that had behaved themselves courageously; And it was resolved by all, that they would no more assail the Enemy till they came to the Strait of <HI>Calice,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Henry Seimour</HI> with his Ships waited their coming. And so far was this <HI>Armado</HI> from terrifying the <HI>English</HI> Coasts, that, they hired Ships from all parts on their own Charges, and came to our supply; of whom were, the Earl of <HI>Oxford, Northumber∣land, Cumberland,</HI> with several other Gentle∣men.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 27. the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet setting forward, anchored before <HI>Calice,</HI> intending to joyn with the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI>'s Forces at <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> followed hard upon them, and cast Anchor within <HI>Culvering</HI> shot of them, consisting now of 140 Sail, the Lord <HI>Hen. Seimour,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Winter</HI> having joyned them. From hence once more the D. of <HI>Medina</HI> sent to the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> and se∣veral
<PB N="159" REF="83"/>
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nobility went ashore, among whom was the Prince of <HI>Ascoli</HI> the Kings Base Son who returned no more; his Ship was afterwards cast away on the <HI>Irish</HI> Coast. The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> being by them persuaded, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had the better, conceived great hopes of his future Advance∣ment: yet his joy was but short, for the next Evening he had news of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> bad success. And indeed he could not in that Juncture assist them; for his Boats leaked, his Provisions failed, and his Seamen with∣drew from him: as also he could not get out by reason of a considerable Fleet of <HI>Dutch</HI> well furnished, that lay before <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Newport.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> or∣dered the Lord Admiral to take 8 of his worst Ships, and fill them with Combustible matter, and to charge their Guns with Bul∣lets, Stones, Chains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was accor∣dingly done; and on <HI>Sunday July</HI> 28. at 2 a Clock in the Morning they were let drive amongst the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under the Guidance of <HI>Yong</HI> and <HI>Prowse;</HI> who having fired their Trains and returned, such a sudden Thun∣derclap was given that the Poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> were wonderfully amazed: and to avoid this danger had no other Remedy, but to cut their Cables and drive at Random, where they
<PB N="160" REF="84"/>
had several Disasters, some of them fell foul upon another, others ran aground on the Sands, and some of them fell into the <HI>English</HI>'s Hands.</P>
<P>In this surprizal the Duke of <HI>Medina</HI> or∣dered the whole Fleet to weigh Anchor to avoid the danger, which done, to return to their Station; and he accordingly gave a signal to the rest to do it by discharging his great Guns; but in this Consternation the Warning was heard but by a few, the rest being scattered.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 29. After this disaster, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the best order they could came over against <HI>Graveling,</HI> where the <HI>English</HI> deprived them of the conveniency of <HI>Calice Road,</HI> and kept them from supply out of <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> And <HI>Drake</HI> and <HI>Fenner</HI> incessantly discharged their Guns on them, as also the Lord Admiral and others: On the other hand the Duke of <HI>Medina, Leva,</HI> &amp;c. at last got clear of the Shallows, yet most of their Ships were piti∣fully torn and shot through, besides several that were sunk. The Gallion St. <HI>Matthew</HI> coming to rescue the St. <HI>Philip</HI> was together with the other miserably torn with shot by <HI>Seimour</HI> and <HI>Winter;</HI> and afterwards driven near <HI>Ostend,</HI> and at last taken by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Francisco de Toledo,</HI> a Colonel over 32 Bands, his Ship proved so leaky, that he
<PB N="161" REF="84"/>
with some others left her; the Ship afterwards was taken by the <HI>Flushingers.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> disappointed of their brave Designs, were now content to defend them∣selves, and the Wind turning S. W. they passed <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> following them close. And the <HI>English</HI> Admiral dispatched the Lord <HI>Henry Seimour</HI> to the Coast of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> to stop the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI>'s coming out, and to joyn with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> there.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 31. early, the N. W. Wind blew hard, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> laboured to recover the Nar∣row Strait, but were driven towards <HI>Zealand.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> gave off the Chase, as seeing them near Ruin. But the Wind turning S. W. and by W. they got clear of the Shallows, and that Evening called a Council, wherein it was resolved to return into <HI>Spain</HI> by the Northern Passage. And thereupon they di∣rected their Course Northward, and the <HI>En∣glish</HI> followed them to prevent their landing in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Yet most thought they would return again; whereupon our Queen with a Masculine Courage, viewed her Army at <HI>Tilbury,</HI> and walking through the Ranks with a Truncheon in her Hand, wonderfully encouraged all of them. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> betook themselves to an absolute Flight, and bended their Course towards <HI>Norway;</HI> and being now freed of the <HI>English,</HI> consulted se∣riously
<PB N="162" REF="85"/>
what to do: they were tender of the Popes credit, feared the wrath of King <HI>Philip;</HI> that the Glory of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would be laid in the Dust; The Invincible <HI>Armado</HI> became a Scorn, if they returned so into <HI>Spain.</HI> On the other hand they considered, that 5000 Souldiers were slain; many maimed; 12 of their greatest Ships sunk, lost, or taken; their Cables, Masts or Sails, cut, rent and broken; their Provisions failing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which things considered, they concluded to go quickly to <HI>Spain.</HI> And knowing that the King of <HI>Scots</HI> would not supply them, nor the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> they cast all their Horses and Mules over Board, to spare their fresh Water. And so steering their Course to sail about <HI>Cathenes,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> they steered between the <HI>Orcades</HI> and the Isles of <HI>Farr</HI> unto 61. deg. North. Lat. from whence the Duke of <HI>Medina,</HI> with his best stored Ships, took Westwards over the Main towards <HI>Biscay,</HI> and at last arrived in <HI>Spain:</HI> where he was deposed from all his Authority, discharged the Court, and com∣manded to live private.</P>
<P>The rest of the Ships being 40, fell nearer with the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where many of them were cast away, such as escaped there, some of them were driven into the Channel, where some of them were taken by the
<PB N="163" REF="85"/>
<HI>English,</HI> others by <HI>Rochel</HI> men, and some of them arrived at <HI>New-Haven</HI> in <HI>Normandy:</HI> So that of 134 Ships that set Sail out of <HI>Lisbon</HI> only 53 returned into <HI>Spain:</HI> of the 4 Galliasses of <HI>Naples</HI> but one: of the 4 Gallions of <HI>Portugal</HI> but one: of the 91 Gallions and great Hulks from diverse Pro∣vinces but 33. In short, they lost in this Voyage 81 Vessels, 13500 Souldiers, Pri∣soners taken above 2000: In <HI>England</HI> were taken, <HI>Don Pedro de Valdez, Don Vasquez de Silva,</HI> and <HI>Don Alonzo de Saies,</HI> and others; In <HI>Ireland Don Alonzo de Luzon,</HI> and <HI>Roderigo de Lesse,</HI> and others; In <HI>Zeland</HI> was <HI>Don Diego Piementelli:</HI> Yea, there was not a Noble Family in <HI>Spain,</HI> but in this Ex∣pedition lost a Son, Brother, or Kinsman.</P>
<P>In the aftermentioned Wracks above 700 Souldiers and Sailers were cast ashore on <HI>Scotland,</HI> who on Intercession of the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> were after a Years time sent over into <HI>Flanders:</HI> But more unmercifully were those Dealt with who were driven into <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> some of them being put to death by their old Friends, the <HI>Irish,</HI> others by the Command of the Lord Deputy, who feared lest they might joyn with the <HI>Irish,</HI> to di∣sturb the Peace of the Nation. The Remain∣der being terrified therewith committed themselves to Sea in their shattered Vessels,
<PB N="164" REF="86"/>
and were many of them swallowed up by the Waves.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> lying one Night in her Army at <HI>Tilbury,</HI> the Lord Treasurer <HI>Burley</HI> came thither, and delivered to the Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> the Examination of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who was taken and brought into <HI>England</HI> by Sir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> which Examination (saith Dr. <HI>Sharp)</HI> was thus:</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro</HI> being asked by some Lords of Council, what was the Intent of their com∣ing? answered, What, but to subdue your Nation, and root it out? What (said the Lords) meant you then to do with the Catholicks? We meant (said he) to have sent them (good Men) directly to Heaven, as you that are He∣reticks to Hell. But (said the Lords) what meant you to do with your Whips of Cords and Wire, you have such store of in your Ships? What, (said he) we meant to whip you Hereticks to death that have assisted my Masters Rebels, and done such dishonour to our Catholick King and People. But what would you have done (said they) with their Young Children? They (said he) that were above 7 Years, should have gone the same Way their Fathers went, and the rest should have lived. Only, we would have branded them in the Foreheads with the Letter <HI>L.</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="86"/>
for <HI>Lutheran,</HI> and reserved them for perpe∣tual Bondage.</P>
<P>This I take God to Witness, (saith my Author) I received of these great Lords as on Examination before the Council, and by their Commandment published it to the Army.</P>
<P>The next day (saith he) the Queen rode through her Army, attended by <HI>Leicester, Essex,</HI> and <HI>Norris,</HI> and diverse other great Lords, where she made an excellent Oration to her Army, and commanded a Publick Fast to be kept.</P>
<P>After this great Deliverance Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> (who ever held ingratitude Base, Especially towards her Almighty Protector) as she began with Prayer, so she ended with Praise and Thanksgiving, commanding Pu∣blick Thanksgiving to be Celebrated in the Cathedral of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> on <HI>Sunday Sept.</HI> 18. at which time 11. of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ensigns were hung upon the lower Battlement of that Church.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> her self on <HI>Sunday Sept.</HI> 24. came to St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> and humbling her self on her Knees, with audible voice she praised God for that Wonderful Deliverance wrought to Her and her People.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="87"/>
At <HI>Southwark</HI> Fair also the <HI>Spanish</HI> Flags were hung upon <HI>London</HI> Bridge. But the solemn Day appointed for Thanksgiving through the Nation was <HI>Nov.</HI> 19. being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> which accordingly was observed with great Joy and Praising of God.</P>
<P>This Admirable Deliverance was congra∣tulated by most other Nations, especially Reformed, and several Learned Men cele∣brated the same in Verse, among which I only mention two: The first is that <HI>Poem</HI> made by Reverend Dr. <HI>Beza,</HI> which is this:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="poem">
<L>STraverat innumeris Hispanus classibus aequor,</L>
<L>Regnis juncturus Sceptra Britanna suis.</L>
<L>Tanti hujus rogitas quae motus causa? superbos</L>
<L>Impulit Ambitio, vexat avaritià.</L>
<L>Quam bene te Ambitio mersit vanissima ventus;</L>
<L>Et tumidae tumidos Vos superastis aquae!</L>
<L>Quam bene Raptores Orbis totius Iberos</L>
<L>Mersit inexhausti justa vorago Maris!</L>
<L>At tu, cui venti, cui totum militat Aequor,</L>
<L>Regina, O mundi totius una decus:</L>
<L>Sic regnare Deo perge, Ambitione remota,</L>
<L>Prodiga sic opibus perge juvare pios,</L>
<L>Ut te Angli longum, longum Anglis ipsa fruaris,</L>
<L>Quam dilecta bonis, tam metuenda malis.</L>

<L><HI>SPains</HI> King with Navies great the Seas bestrew'd.</L>
<L>T'augment with <HI>English</HI> Crown his <HI>Spanish</HI> sway.</L>
<L>Ask ye what caus'd this proud attempt? 'twas lewd</L>
<L><HI>Ambition</HI> drove, and <HI>Avarice</HI> led the way.</L>
<L>It's well; Ambitions windy puff lies drown'd</L>
<L>By Winds and swelling Hearts, by swelling Waves:</L>
<L>It's well; those <HI>Spaniards</HI> who the <HI>Worlds</HI> vast round</L>
<L>Devour'd, devouring Sea most justly craves:</L>
<L>But thou, O <HI>Queen,</HI> for whom <HI>Winds, Seas</HI> do war,</L>
<L>O thou the Glory of this Worlds wide Mass,</L>
<L>So reign to God still, from Ambition far,</L>
<L>So still with bounteous aids the <HI>Good</HI> imbrace:</L>
<L>That Thou maist <HI>England</HI> long, long <HI>Eng∣land</HI> thee enjoy,</L>
<L>Thou terror of all <HI>Bad,</HI> Thou <HI>Good</HI> Mens joy.</L>
