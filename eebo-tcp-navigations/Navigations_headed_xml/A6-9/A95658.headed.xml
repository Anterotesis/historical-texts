<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here was never age more guil∣ty than this present, of the great expence, and waste of paper: whose fair innocence hath been extreamly stubber'd by Errors, Heresies, Blasphemies, and what not, in these bold times: which like so many (the foulest of all) blots, &amp; blurs, hath defiled very much of it, so true is that of the Poet,</P>
<Q><L>—Tenet insanabile multos</L>
<L>Scribendi Cacoëthes.—<HI>Ju.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Certainly there hath been of late abun∣dantly more printed than ought, than should: &amp; if what follows in this discourse lay under the guilt of any such just exce∣ption, it should feel the fire, not the press.</P>
<P>The summe &amp; substance of what here follows (as a description of that Empire) I long since composed, shortly after my re∣turn from <HI>East-India,</HI> and then presented it in writing unto the late King, when he was Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> in the year 1622. with this short following Epistle.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Renowned Prince,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have nothing to plead for this high presumption, but the Novelty of my subject, in which I confesse some few have prevented me, who bv traveling <HI>India</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Europe,</HI> have writ∣ten somewhat of those remotest parts, but like unto poor Tradesmen, who take up Wares on trust, have been deceived themselves, and do deceive of others.</P>
<P>For my self I was an eye-witnesse of much here related, living more than two years at the Court of that mighty Monarch the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> (who prides himself very much in his most famous Ancestor <HI>Tamberlane)</HI> in the descripti∣on of whose Empire, your Highnesse may meet with large Territories, a nu∣merous Court, most populous, pleasant, and rich Provinces, but when all these shall be laid in the Balance against his miserable blindnesse, your Highnesse shall have more cause to pity, than envy his greatnesse.</P>
<P><PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
I am not ambitious to make this my Relation publick, and therefore if it consume more paper, it shall not be my fault: As it is, in a fearfull boldnesse 'tis offered to your Princely hands, and if it may be any way pleasing and usefull, I have my reward; if not, my most hum∣ble desires to have ministred something this way unto your Highnesse, shall be my comfort.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus <HI>(Reader)</HI> thou hearest when this Relation was first written, and into what hands it was then put: And although there be now a very great space of time 'twixt the particulars then observed, and their publication now; which may make thee look upon that which is here brought forth <HI>as an untimely birth,</HI> or as a thing <HI>born out of due time.</HI> Therefore know (which may give thee some satisfaction herein) that for the commodities, and discommodities of those remote parts; for the customes and manners of that people; for their Religion and policie, with every
<PB REF="4"/>
thing beside (wherein thou mayest desire information) which lies within the vast compasse of that huge Monarchy expres∣sed in the Map, and further described in this following discourse (time not making that people at all to varie from them∣selves) thou mayest look upon it now, as if it hath been taken notice of, but imme∣diately before it was here communicated; and if it prove usefull now, I shall be ve∣ry glad that it was reserved even for this present time, wherein it might do some good.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding this, it should ne∣ver have been brought by me into this more open view, (especially in such a scribling writing age as this) <HI>where there is no end of making many books;</HI> (and many of those written to no end, but what is evil and mischievous) but that the Printer, who had gotten my Ori∣ginal Copie, presented as before, desired to publish it. And because so, I have re∣vised, and in some particulars by perti∣nent, though in some places very long di∣gressions
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
(which I would intreat the Rea∣der to improve) so enlarged it; that it may, (if it reach my aim) contain matter for instruction and use, as well as for re∣lation and novelty. So that they, who fly from a Sermon, and will not touch sound, and wholesom, and excellent treatises in Divinity, may happily (if God so please) be taken before they are aware, and over∣come by some Divine truths that lie scattered up and down in manie pla∣ces of this Narrative. To which end I have endeavoured so to contrive it for every one (who shall please to read it through) that it may be like a well form'd picture, that seems to look stedfastly upon everie heholder, who so looks upon it.</P>
<P>But here Reader, let us sit down and wonder that in these dayes (which are cal∣led times of Reformation) manie choise books are often published, which contain in themselves, and declare unto others very much of the minde of God: yet are laid aside, as if they were not worth the looking into, and in their stead <HI>Roman∣ces,</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>
and other Pamphlets, <HI>ejusdem fari∣nae,</HI> of the like kinde, which do not in∣form, but corrupt rather the mindes of those, which look so much into them, teaching wickednesse while they seem to reprove it, are the books (O times!) which are generally call'd for, bought up, read, and liked.</P>
<P>When a Traveller sometimes observed the women in <HI>Rome</HI> to please themselves in, and overmuch to play with their Curs, and Monkeys; he asked whether or no the women of <HI>Rome</HI> did not bear Children to delight themselves withall. The storie is so parallel to what I before observed; that he who runs may make Application, and therefore I forbear to do it.</P>
<P>As for that I have here published I know,—<HI>habent sua fata libelli,</HI> that books have their Fates, as well as their Authors; and therefore this Relation now it is got into the World, must take its chance, whatsoever its successe, or acce∣ptance be: But however I shall never be of their minde, who think those books best,
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
which best sell, when certain it is that they are not to be valued by their good sale, but good use.</P>
<P>Which while some may make of this; others who love to carp, and censure, and quarrel (so as <HI>to make a man an offen∣der for a word)</HI> may put harsh interpre∣tation upon some passages they may find in this following discourse. <HI>Mala mens, ma∣lus animus,</HI> an evil minde in it self, is an evil minde to all others. 'Twas said of <HI>Diogenes</HI> that he was <HI>tuba convitio∣rum;</HI> the <HI>Trumpet</HI> of <HI>reproaches;</HI> and that when he accused <HI>Plato</HI> of pride, he beat it down with greater pride. The <HI>Gra∣marians</HI> were laughed at for taking so much pains to find out the faults of <HI>Ulys∣ses,</HI> and would not take notice of any of their own. They are the worst of the Crea∣tures that breed in, and delight to be ever stirring up and down in corruption. But I would have all, who have an eye stand∣ing too far out of their heads, and are therefore apt to see more in others than themselves, and consequently may observe
<PB REF="6"/>
more than is meant, from some passages of this book, to bound all their conceivings a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to what they may finde here within the compasse of it, by that rule, which holds good in charity and law, and is true in Di∣vinity likewise, <HI>in dubiis benigniora,</HI> that when any thing delivered may bear two interpretations, to take the fairest.</P>
<P>And now that this following relation may not appear to be a losse, either of time or paper, he that shall please to read it, in our passage to <HI>East-India</HI> may observe very large foot-steps of the Almighty in his works of Creation &amp; Providence. And when I have brought him thither on shore he may finde that there is not one que∣stion (as before) of any consequence con∣cerning those parts I have undertaken to write of, but it findes satisfaction in one part or other of this discourse. For the Court there, there is so much riches and splendour sometimes to be seen in it, that it may draw up the meditations of those which behold it, as the thoughts of <HI>Ful∣gentius</HI> sometimes were, (when he beheld
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/>
the glorie of the Court of <HI>Rome)</HI> raised up seriously to consider of the glorie of Heaven. And for the soil it is exceeding pleasant, rich, and good, as in some other parts of the world, where the inhabitants are meer strangers to God; and if Al∣mighty God hath given such sweet places of abode here on the earth to very many whom he owns not; how transcendently glorious is that place which he hath pre∣pared for them that love him.</P>
<P>Yet for the Inhabitants there, a man may clearly see, the law of Nature to be so ingraved upon the hearts of very many, both <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Mahometans:</HI> as that it may make multitudes, who pro∣fesse themselves Christians (if they would but turn their eyes inward) extreamly to wonder, how it comes to be so much wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out of theirs.</P>
<P>And then he may further behold, such <HI>Temperance, Justice,</HI> unwearied <HI>devo∣tion</HI> (but in a wrong way) with many o∣ther excellent <HI>Moralitics</HI> so to shine its them; that by this very light, he may see
<PB REF="7"/>
thousands of those (whom before I nam'd) that have means to know, and there∣fore should do better, in many things to come exceeding short of them, who (them∣selves are ready to conclude) come short of Heaven.</P>
<P>But I shall not further anticipate my discourse, in being like a vain-glorious entertainer, who fills the ears of his guests with his dishes, before they see, or taste them. Which if thou shall please to do, read on, and thou art very welcome how∣ever.</P>

So to make a re-entry upon a long-since fini∣shed Voyage; The third of <HI>February</HI> 1615. Our Fleet consisting of six good Ships, three great, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Charles,</HI> Admirall of that Companie, then a New-built goodly Ship of a Thousand Tuns, (in which I sayled;) the <HI>Unicorn;</HI> a new Ship likewise, and almost of as great a burden; the <HI>James,</HI> a great Ship too; Three lesser, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Globe,</HI> the <HI>Swan,</HI> the <HI>Rose,</HI> (all under the Com∣mand of Captain <HI>Benjamin Joseph)</HI> fell down from Graves-end into <HI>Tilbury</HI> Hope. where we continued till the eighth day following, when we weighed Anchor, and by a slow, that we might have the safer passage, the twelfth came into the Downs, where an adverse wind forced our abode till the ninth of <HI>March,</HI> on which day it pleased God to send us, what wee had much desired, a North-East wind, which made us leave that weary Road, and set sayl for <HI>East-India;</HI> and the eleventh about night, we were in the height of the <HI>Lizard</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and that day, for that time took our last sight of our Country.</P>
<P>This wind was favourable to us till the six∣teenth day at night, at which time a most fearfull storm met us, we being then in the Bay of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> whose violence continued five whole dayes and nights; and that Tempest was the most live∣ly and reall Comment, that ever I observed▪ on that place recorded in <HI>Psal. 107. 23. verse,</HI> &amp;c. thus rendred;</P>
<Q><PB N="3" REF="17"/>
<L>In winged Ships who passage make,</L>
<L>And through vast Seas their journeys take,</L>
<L>See, while their Ships on Billowes keep,</L>
<L>God's works, and wonders in the deep;</L>
<L>Who there Commands the Winds to storm,</L>
<L>These mount the waves, on which are born</L>
<L>The tottering Ships on watery heaps,</L>
<L>Now high to th' Heavens, then low to th' Deep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</L>
<L>The Sea-mens hearts they melt for woe,</L>
<L>Nor Head, nor Foot their office know;</L>
<L>They reel like to a drunken one,</L>
<L>And stagger, for their wisdome's gone.</L>
<L>Then cry they to the Lord in these</L>
<L>Great streights, who them hears, them frees;</L>
<L>The winds, and waves obey Gods will,</L>
<L>The storme's a calm, the waves lie still,</L>
<L>Then are they glad—&amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>The 28. day we had sight of the Grand <HI>Canaries,</HI> and of that Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain in the Island of <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Peake.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Qui—Caput inter nubila condit.</L>
<L>—so high,</L>
<L>As that it threats the Neighbouring skie.</L>
<L><HI>or</HI>—that shrowds</L>
<L>It's loftie head amongst the Clouds.</L></Q>
<P>This over-grown rise of Earth, is in shape like to a Pyramis or Sugar-loafe, circled, and wrapt
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
about which many wreaths of clouds, which en∣compass it by severall distances, as first earth, then clouds, above which the earth appears a∣gain, then clouds, again, then earth, the top of it being of such an immense height, that it may be as truly sayd of this, as <HI>Virgil. Eclog▪</HI> 5. writes of <HI>Olympus.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Candidus insuetum miratur limen Olympi,</L>
<L>Sub pedibus{que} videt Nubes, &amp; sidera.—</L></Q>
<Q><L>So beautifull, it Heavens unwonted spires,</L>
<L>And Clouds, and Stars under its feet admires.</L></Q>
<P>This <HI>Peake</HI> of <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> in a cleer day, may be seen (if the Mariners report truth) more than forty leagues at Sea. These Islands lye 28 Degrees of North Latitude.</P>
<P>The 31. being Easter day, we passed under the Tropick of <HI>Cancer;</HI> and the seventh of <HI>April</HI> the Sun was our <HI>Zenith</HI> or <HI>Verticall,</HI> at noon day directly over our heads, which we found by this infallible Demonstration made by a slender knife, or long Needle, set upright, and did cast no shadow. The Sun in this course like the Equino∣ctiall, divides the Globe of the Heavens in two equall parts; and in this Motion ariseth so di∣rectly or upright, that there is but a very little time 'twixt the darkness and the appearance of the body of the Sun in the morning for 'tis dark
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
immediatly before the Sun then appears; and so 'tis in the Evening presently after the Sun hath left the Hemisphere. Here wee were becalmed fourteen dayes, enduring extreme heat.</P>
<P>The sixteenth we met with winds, (we being then against, and not far from the Coasts of <HI>A∣frica)</HI> which the Mariners call the <HI>Turnadoes▪</HI> ve∣ry strange Gusts indeed, like those in <HI>Aeschylus,</HI> on the shore <HI>Aesc.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: <HI>(ad finem.)</HI></P>

<Q><L>—Whirlwinds around</L>
<L>Hurry the dust: the blasts rebound</L>
<L>Storming on all sides: thus together.</L>
<L>Enraged Gusts oppose each other.</L></Q>
<P>Or like those in <HI>Virgil</HI> at Sea. <HI>Aeneid. 1. v. 85. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Haec ubidicta, Cavum conversa cuspide montem</L>
<L>Impulit in latus: at venti velut agmine facto,</L>
<L>Quà data porta, ruunt, &amp; terras turbine perslant.</L>
<L>Incubuere mari, totum{que} à sedibus imis</L>
<L>Unà Eurus{que} Notus{que} ruunt, creber{que} procellis</L>
<L>Africus: &amp; vastos volvunt ad littora fluctus.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Thus sayd, with his spears point the hollow Hill</L>
<L>He turn'd aside, the winds left to their will</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="19"/>
All sally out, and blustering through the world</L>
<L>Fall on the Sea; which from the depth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is hurld</L>
<L>By th' East, and South at once, and stormy North,</L>
<L>Which to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shore, huge wallowing waves roul forth.</L></Q>
<P>Those self-opposing blasts we there had, were so variable and uncertain, that sometimes with∣in the space of one hour, all the thirty two seve∣rall winds, (which are observed in so many points of the Compasse) will blow, so that if there be many Ships in company, you may ob∣serve them all to sayl so many severall wayes, and every one of them seem to goe directly be∣fore the wind. Now that it should be so here, and not known so to be in any part of the world be∣side I ever heard of, if not in those winds, which they say are sometimes sold by the <HI>Lapland</HI> Witches, I can give no reason for it, unlesse Satan (who is most Tyrannicall where he is most o∣beyed) that Prince of the Ayr seems to rule more here, than hee doth in other parts. And most certain it is that he rules very much in the Inhabitants on that Main, the poor, ignorant, and most miserable Negroes, born for sale▪ and slavery, and slaughter. These strange Gusts were accompanied with much Thunder and Light∣ning and with extreme rain, so noysome, that it made their cloths who stir'd much in it▪ presently to stink upon their backs; the water likewise of
<PB N="7" REF="19"/>
those slimy, unwholsome, hot, and unsavorie showres, wheresoever it stood, would presently bring forth many little offensive Creatures. These Turnadoes met with us when we were about 12. Degrees of North Latitude, and kept us company ere they quitted us, two Degrees South∣ward of the Equinoctial, under which we passed the 28. of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>The 19th of <HI>May</HI> being Whitsunday, wee passed the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> so that we were seven weeks compleat under the <HI>Torrid Zone.</HI></P>
<P>Between the Tropicks wee saw (almost every day) different kinds of fishes, in greater abundance than else-where, as the great <HI>Leviathan whom God hath made to take his pastime in the Sea; Granpisces,</HI> or lesser whales, <HI>Sharkes, Turtles</HI> or <HI>Torteises, Dolphins, Bonitoes, Albicores, Porpisces, Flying fishes,</HI> with many others. Some Whales we saw of an exceeding greatnesse, who in calm weather often arise and shew themselves on the top of the water, where they appear like unto great Rocks, in their rise, spouting up into the Ayr with noyse, a great quantity of water which falls down again about them like a showr. The Whale may well challenge the Principalitie of the Sea, yet I suppose that he hath many ene∣mies in this his large Dominion; for instance, a little long Fish called a Thresher often encoun∣ters with him, who by his agilitie vexeth him as much in the Sea, as a little Bee in Sum∣mer,
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
doth a great Beast on the shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Shark</HI> hath not this name for nothing; for he will make a morsell of any thing he can catch, master and devour. These <HI>Shark</HI> are most rave∣nous fishes; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have many times observed that when they have been swimming about our Ships (as oftentimes they doe) and we have cast over-board an iron hook made strong for this purpose, fastned to a roap strong like it, bayted with a piece of beese of five pounds weight▪ this bayt hath been presently taken by one of them and if by chance the weight of the fish, thus taken, in haling him up, hath broken out the Hooks hold, not well fastned (as sometimes it did) so that he fell again into the Sea, he would pre∣sently bite at an other Bayt, and so bite till he was taken. Not much unlike many vile men, who think they may safely take any thing they can finger and get, and having been fastned in, and escaped out of many Snares will take no warning but be still nibling and biting at what they like not once considering that there is an hook within the bayt, that will take them at last, and hamper them to their unavoydable de∣struction. This Sea-shark is a Fish as bad in eat∣ing, as he is in qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>y a very moyst watery fish, yet eaten at Sea (because any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh thing will there down) but no good food. This Fish turns himself on his back to take his prey by which he gives warning to many other little fishes, who ever
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
swim about him, to avoyd his swollow. Those Fishes that thus keep him company, are called by the Mariners, <HI>Pilate-fishes,</HI> who alwayes shape their course the same way the Shark takes, and by consequence (nature having made them so wary) he becomes their guard, they not his food. And there are other fishes too they call <HI>Sucking∣fish,</HI> that stick as close to the body of the Shark, as a Tike on the shore doth to the body of a Beast, and so receive their nourishment from him and he must be contented, for while he is swimming up and down, he cannot possibly free himself of them▪ Many of these Sharks grow to a very large greatness; they have a broad roundhead, in which are three rowes of teeth very strong and sharp, by which they are able to take off the leg of a man at one bite, as some have found by wofull experience, while they have been carelesly swimming in these hot Seas, where these Sharks most use and certainly were they as nimble as they are mischievous, would doe very much hurt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turtle</HI> or <HI>Torteis</HI> is one of those crea∣tures we call <HI>Amphibia,</HI> that lives sometimes in the Sea and sometimes on the shore, he is mar∣vellously fortified by Nature dwelling (as it were) continually under a strong roof, which moves with him, and covers (when he will) his whole body; therefore <HI>Testudo</HI> which signi∣fies a Torteise, signifies also the roof or vault of
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
an house, which covers all within it. Those con∣cave backs (like bucklets, but of an Oval shape) that cover these creatures, are many of them so exceeding strong, that they will bear off the weight of a Cart-wheel. These Torteises increase by eggs (as I have been often told) are very good to eat, the substance within them (whether you will call it flesh or fish) first boy∣led, and after minced with butter, tastes like but∣tered Veal, Their shell makes (as is very com∣monly known) excellent good Combes, Cups, or Boxes, and further it is used by them in <HI>East-India,</HI> to make or adorn little or great Ca∣binets.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphin</HI> is a fish called for his swiftnesse the Arrow of the Sea differing in this one parti∣cular from all other fishes I ever observed, in that he hath many little teeth upon the top of his tongue. Hee is very pleasing to the eye, smell and taste, of a changeable colour, finn'd like a Roach, covered with many small scales, having a fresh delightsome sent above other fishes, and in taste as good as any; these Dolphins are wont often to follow our ships, not so much I think for the love they bear unto man, (as some write,) as to feed themselves with what they find cast over board, whence it comes to pass, that many times they feed us, for when they swim close to our ships wee often strike them with a broad in∣strument, full of barbs, called an Harping-iron,
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>
fastned to a roap, by which we hale them in; This Dolphin may be a fit Embleme of an ill race of people, who under sweet countenances, carry sharp tongues.</P>
<P><HI>Bonitoes</HI> and <HI>Albicores,</HI> are in colour, shape, and taste, much like unto Mackrels, and as good fish as they, but they grow to be very exceeding large.</P>
<P>The <HI>Porpisces</HI> or <HI>Hogfish,</HI> are like the former; very large and great, but better to look upon than to taste; they usually appear at Sea in very great sholes or companies, and are (as if they came of the race of the <HI>Gadaren</HI> Swine, that ran violently into the Sea) very swift in their motion, and like a company matching in rank and file; They leap or mount very nimbly over th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> waves and so down and up again, making a melancholy noyse, when they are above the wa∣ter. These are usually, when they thus appear, certain presagers of very foul weather.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flying fishes</HI> have skinny wings like unto Batts, but larger▪ they are stifned and strength∣ned with many little bones, such as are in the back finns of Pearches, by which they fly▪ but a little way at a time; they have small bodyes like unto Pilchers, and appear when they fly, in marvellous great companies, and some of them often fly into our ships, by which we have tasted that they are excellent good fish. Of all other, these flying Fishes live the most miserable lives,
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
for being in the water, the Dolphins, Bonitoes, Albicores, and Porpisces, chase persecute and take them, and when they would escape by their flight, are oftentimes caught by ravenous Fowls, somewhat like our Kites, which hover over the water. These flying Fishes are like men profes∣sing two trades and thrive at neither.</P>
<P>I could further enlarge, but my business is not to write an History of <HI>Fishes,</HI> yet in those wee have named, as in thousands more which inha∣bite that watery Main, I desire with <HI>David,</HI> to admire and say, <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy works;</HI> manifold, and wonderfull indeed, as he that will take notice, many observe every where, but in a speciall manner (because they are more rare) in the great varietie of strange Creatures, which the Sea, that womb of moysture, brings forth, in which many things we behold are won∣derfull, and many things besides we cannot see, are certainly more full of wonder.</P>

<P>But to proceed on our Voyage, the 12. of <HI>June</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
early in the morning, we espied our long-wished for harbour the Bay of <HI>Souldania,</HI> about twelve leagues short of the Cape of good Hope, where we came happily to an Ankor that forenoon. In which Bay we found a Dutch-ship bound for <HI>Bantam,</HI> which had taken in her course, and brought thither, a small <HI>Portugal</HI> bound to <HI>An∣gola,</HI> a Colonie belonging to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> lying in the skirts of <HI>Africa,</HI> about ten degrees South of the Line; in which small ship amongst many rich Commodities (as we heard) to the value of five or six thousand pounds sterling, there were ten <HI>Portugal</HI> Virgins (as they call'd themselves) sent to that Colonie I suppose for Husbands. The young women were well-favoured, and well clad in silks, but such were the courtesies of these Dutch-men towards them, as that they took not only away all the goods, Artilerie, and good provisions of their ship, but they rob'd these poor captive Maidens of all their apparell, (which they most sadly complained of) to one poor suit (and I suppose of their honour too, if they brought it with them) then giving them water for their wine, and a very scant proporti∣on of all other provisions, turn'd them with their unarm'd, leakie, and ill-man'd ship, to the mercy of the Seas, the twentieth day following.</P>
<P>This Bay of <HI>Souldania</HI> lyeth in 34 degrees and half of South Latitude in a sweet Climate, full of fragrant herbs (which the soyl produceth of its
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
self) pleasing to the sense, where our ships com∣panies, when they have often-times there arrived, with very weak and feeble bodies, usually by that Sea disease the Scurvy, in which disease (I shall observe by the way) if any that have it, be not too much overgone with it, assoon as hee comes to enjoy the fresh ayr on any shore, with fresh water, and fresh food he will presently re∣cover; but if this disease have over-much pre∣vailed on him, immediatly after he sets his foot on shore, he usually dies. I say our people when they have come hither with very crazie bodies, have often found here much good refreshing; for besides a most delectable brook of pure good water, arising hard by, out of a mighty hill (call'd for its form the Table, close by which there is another Hill, which ariseth exceeding high like a Pyramis, and called by Passengers the Sugar∣loaf) there are good store of Cattell, as little Beeves, called by the barbarous Inhabitants. Boos; and Sheep which they call Baas, who bear a short coarse hairie wooll, and I conceive are never shorn. These Boos and Baas, (as they call them) were formerly bought in great plenty, for small quantities of Kettle-brasse, and Iron Hoops, taken off our Empty Cask; (which are all for this long voyage hoop'd with Iron.) These Salva∣ges had their cattell which we bought of them, at a very great Command, for with a call they would presently run to them, and when they had
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
sold any one of their bullooks to us, for a little inconsiderate peece of brasse, if we did not pre∣sently knock him down, they would by the same call, make the poor creature break from us and run unto them again, and then there was no get∣ting them out of their hands, but by giving them more brasse, and by this trick now and then, they sold the same beast unto us, two or three times; and if they had thus sold him more often, he had been a good penny worth; how ever in this wee might observe, the covetousness and deceit of this brutish people. Here yee must know that this people of all metals seem to love brasse, I think (as you may ghesse afterward) for the ranknesse of its smell; with which they make great rings to wear about their wrists; yea, so taken are they with this base metall that if a man lay down before them a peece of gold worth two pounds sterling, and a peece of brasse worth two pence, they will leave the Gold, and take the brasse On this shore there likewise are found excellent good, though small roots for Salads, which the soyl brings forth without husbanding. And in the head of the Bay, may be taken with netts, great store of fayr fat Mullets, of which we took abundance.</P>
<P>This remotest part of <HI>Africa,</HI> is very moun∣tainous, over-run with wild beasts, as Lions, Ty∣gres, Wolves, and many other beasts of prey, which in the silent night discover themselves by
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
their noyse and roaring; to the Teeth and Jawes of which cruell Beasts, the Natives here expose their old people, if death prevent it not, when once they grow very old and troublesome, laying them forth in some open place in the dark night, <HI>When the wild beasts</HI> (as <HI>David</HI> observes, <HI>Psal. 104. 20, 21.) doe creep forth, and the young lyons roar after their prey.</HI> One miserable poor old wretch was thus exposed when we were there, who by his pittifull cryes, was discovered by our Court of Guard, there on shore, and not far off from him, and by them relieved and delivered for that present time, out of the jawes of Death; And wee asking <HI>Coorce</HI> one of the Natives (whose story you shall have by and by) why they did so, he told us, it was their custome, when their people had lived so long, that they knew not what to doe with them, thus to be rid of them.</P>
<P>Wee saw in this Bay of <HI>Souldania</HI> many Whales, and about the shore divers party-colou∣red Fowles; And here are Ostriches to be seen. For the soyl about the Bay, it seems to be very good, but the Sun shines not upon a people in the whole world, more barbarous than those which possesse it; Beasts in the skins of men, rather than men in the skins of beasts, as may appear by their ignorance, habit, language, diet, with other things, which make them most brutish.</P>

First for God, the great God of Heaven and Earth, whom generally all the people in the world, Heathen, as well as Christians doe confess, they (as this <HI>Cooree</HI> told us) acknowledge none. For their speech it seemed to us inarticulate noyse rather than Language, like the clucking of Hens, or gabling of Turkeys; and thus making a very strange confused noyse, when they walk here or there: if there be two or three, or five, or ten, or twenty, or very many more in company, it is their manner to walk in rank one after the other, in small paths they have made by their thus walking, as Kine in Summer many times doe, when they come home to the Payl; or as wild∣geese who fly in ranks, and as they fly make a noyse; so these walking together thus gabble from the first to the last in company, as if all spake, but none answered. Their Habits are their sheeps skins undrest, thonged together, which cover their bodies to the middle, with a little flap of the same skin tyed before them, being naked downward, and when tis cold keep the woolly, when hotter weather, the fleshy side of those skins next to their bodies. Their ornaments and Jew∣els. Bullocks or sheeps-guts full of excrement, about their necks, and therefore when we bought their Cattell they would take (and we were content they should) their skins, guts, and gar∣bage, which plentifully furnished them with that rich attire, and gay ornaments; and when they
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
were hungry, they would sit down upon some hillock, first shaking out some of that filthy pud∣ding out of the guts they wore about their necks, then bowing and bringing their mouths to their hands, almost as low as their knees, like hungry doggs would gnaw, and eat the raw guts, when you may conceive their mouths full of sweet green sawce. The women as the men are thus adorned, thus habited, and thus dieted only they wear more about their lower parts than the men. And (by the way) these carry their suck∣ing infants under their skins upon their backs, and their brests hanging down like Bag-pipes, they put up with their hands to their children, that they may suck them over their shoulders. Both sexes make coverings for their heads like to skull caps, with Cow-dung, and such like filth mingled with a little stinking grease, with which they likewise besmear their faces, which makes their company unsufferable, if they get the wind of you. I observed, that some of the rest of their dyet was agreeable to the former, for they would eat any refuse thing, as rotten and mouldy Bis∣kets, which we have given them, fit indeed for nothing but to be cast away; yea, they will eat that which a ravenous dog in <HI>England</HI> will re∣fuse. I once tooke notice of a Couple of them, who had found on the neighbouring shore a large piece of a dead fish the Sea had cast up, which did most sufficiently stink, they presently made a
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
little fire with dry Cow-dung, and with this they warm'd it, and then they eat it, with as much seeming appetite, as an hungry man with us, would feed upon a very choyse and savoury dish, which makes me almost to believe, that those wretched creatures have but three senses, wanting the benefit both of Smelling and Tasting. They lodge upon the earth in Hovels, so ill covered, that they keep not out the weather, made like to those we call Summer-houses, with Boughs and sticks.</P>

<P>These Brutes devote themselves to idlenesse, for they neither dig nor spin. For their stature and making they are very streight, and well lim'd, though not very tall but in their faces very ill∣favoured, for the noses of most of them are flat. They have little or no beard; the hair on their heads short black and curled; their skins very tawny; swift they are of foot, and will throw Darts, and shoot Arrows, which are their wea∣pons very dangerously.</P>
<P>Me thinks when I have seriously considered, the Dresses the Habitations, and the Diet of this people, with other things, and how these beasts
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
of Mankind live all like Brutes, nay worse, I have thought that if they had the accommodati∣ons wee enjoy (to make our lives more com∣fortable) by good dwelling, warm clothing, sweet lodging, and wholsome food, they would be abundantly pleased with such a change of their condition; For as Love proceeds from Knowledge, and liking; and we can neither love nor like any thing we cannot know: so when we come to a sensible understanding of things wee knew not before; when the Belly teaches, and the Back instructs a man would believe that these should work some strong convictions. But I shall here insert a short story; About three years before I went to <HI>India,</HI> it happened, that one of the Companie ships returning thence, and arriving at this barbour, after a little stay, when she was ready to set sayl for <HI>England,</HI> and having then two of these Salvages aboard, her Com∣mander resolv'd to bring them both home with him, thinking that when they had got some Eng∣lish here they might discover something of their Country which we could not know before. These poor wretches being thus brought away, very much against both their minds, one of them (meerly out of extreme sullenness though he was very well used) died shortly after they put to Sea, the other who call'd himself <HI>Cooree</HI> (whom I mentioned before) lived and was brought to <HI>London,</HI> and there kept, for the space
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
of six moneths, in Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI>'s house (then Governour of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company) where he had good diet good clothes, good lodg∣ing, with all other fitting accommodations; now one would think that this wretch might have conceived his present, compared with his former condition, an Heaven upon earth, but he did not so, though he had to his good entertainment made for him a Chain of bright Brasse, an Ar∣mour, Brest, Back, and Head-piece, with a Buck∣ler all of Brasse, his beloved Metall, yet all this contented him not, for never any seemed to be more weary of ill usage, than he was of Courte∣sies; none ever more desirous to return home to his Countrey than he; For when he had learned a little of our Language, he would daily lye up∣on the ground, and cry very often thus in broken English, <HI>Cooree home goe, Souldania goe, home goe;</HI> And not long after when he had his desire, and was returned home, he had no sooner set footing on his own shore, but presently he threw away his <HI>Clothes,</HI> his <HI>Linnen,</HI> with all other <HI>Co∣vering,</HI> and got his sheeps skins upon his back, guts about his neck, and such a perfum'd Cap (as before we named) upon his head; by whom that Proverb mentioned, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 22. was lite∣rally fulfill'd, <HI>Canis ad vomitum; The dogge is return'd to his vomit, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> swine to his wal∣lowing in the mire.</HI> From all which wee may draw this Conclusion, that a continued Custome
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
may make many things that seem strange and loathsom to some, even naturall to others, and that the most brutish life may seem civill, and best to a most brutish man; and he thus plead∣ing for it.</P>

<P>After this fellow was returned, it made the Natives most shie of us when we arrived there, for though they would come about us in great Companies when we were new come thither, yet three or four dayes before they conceiv'd we would depart thence, there was not one of them to be seen, fearing belike we would have dealt with some more of them, as formerly we had done with <HI>Cooree.</HI> But it had been well if he had not seen <HI>England;</HI> for as he discovered nothing to us, so certainly when he came home, he told his Country-men (having doubtless observed so much here) that <HI>Brass</HI> was but a base and cheap commoditie in <HI>England,</HI> and happily we had so well stored them with that metall before, that we had never after such a free Exchange of our Brass and Iron for their Cattell. It was here that I asked <HI>Cooree</HI> who was their God? he lifting up his hands answered thus, in his bad English, <HI>England God, great God, Souldania n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God.</HI></P>
<P>Now if any one desire to know under whose Command these Brutes live or whether they have
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
any Superiority, &amp; Subordination amongst them∣selves, or whether they live with their females in common, with many other questions that might be put, I am not able to satisfie them; But this I look upon as a great happiness not to be born, one of them, and as great, nay a far greater misery, to fall from the loyns of <HI>Civill</HI> &amp; <HI>Christian Parents,</HI> and after to degenerate into all brutishness, as very many doe, <HI>qui Gentes agunt sub nomine Christia∣norum;</HI> the thing which <HI>Tertullian</HI> did most sad∣ly bewail in many of his time, who did act <HI>A∣theism</HI> under the Name of <HI>Christianity,</HI> and did even shame Religion by their light and loose pro∣fessing of it. When <HI>Anacharsis</HI> the Philosopher was sometime upbraided with this, that he was a <HI>Scythian</HI> by birth, he presently returned this quick and smart answer unto him that cast that in his teeth; <HI>Mihi quidem Patria est dedecus, tu autem Patriae,</HI> my Country indeed is some disparagement to me, but thou art a disgrace to thy Country, as there be many thousands more beside, who are very burdens to the good Places that give them <HI>Brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> &amp; <HI>Bread.</HI> Alas, <HI>Turkie,</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> and these <HI>Africans,</HI> with many millions more in that part of the world &amp; in <HI>America,</HI> and in <HI>Asia,</HI> I and in <HI>Europe</HI> too, would wring their hands into peeces, if they were truly sensible of their condition, because they know so little; And so shall infinite numbers more one day born in the visible Church of God, <HI>in the valley of visions,</HI> Es. 22. 1.
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
have their very hearts broken into shivers, because they knew so much, or might have known so much, and have known and done so little; for without all doubt, the day will one day come, when they who have sinned against the strongest means of Grace and Salvation shall feel the heaviest miserie, when their means to know God, in his will revealed in his Word, shall be put in one Balance, and their improvement of this means by their Practice in the other, and if there have not bin some good proportion betwixt these two, manifested in their lives, what hath been wanting in their <HI>Practice</HI> shall be made up in their <HI>Punishment.</HI> But I would not here more digress. I have one thing more which accidentally relates to this place, and then I will leave it.</P>
<P>In the year 1614. ten English men having received the sentence of death for their severall crimes at the Sessions house in the old-Baily at <HI>London,</HI> had their Execution respited by the in∣treaty of the <HI>East-India</HI> Merchants, upon con∣dition that they should be all banished to this place, to the end (if they could find any peacea∣ble abode there) they might discover something advantagious to their trade; And this was accor∣dingly done. But two of them when they came thither were taken thence, and carried on the voyage. One whose sirname was <HI>Duffield</HI> by Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> that year sent Ambassadour to the Great <HI>Mogol;</HI> that fellow thus redeemed
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
from a most sad Banishment, was afterward brought back again into <HI>England</HI> by that noble Gentleman, and here being intrusted by him, stole some of his Plate and ran away; another was carried on the Voyage likewise, but what became of him afterward I know not. So that there remained eight which were there left with some Ammunition▪ and victual, with a small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oat to carry them to and from a very little un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>habited Island lying in the very mouth of that Bay, a place for their retreat and safety from the Natives on the Main. The Island called <HI>Pen-guin Island,</HI> probaby so named at first by some Welshman, in whose language <HI>Pen-guin</HI> signifies a white head and there are very many great lazy fowls upon, and about this Island, with great cole∣black bodies, and very white heads, called <HI>Pen-guins.</HI> The chief man of the eight there left was sirnamed <HI>Cross,</HI> who took the Name upon him of Captain <HI>Cross,</HI> He was formerly a Yeo∣man of the Guard unto King <HI>James;</HI> But having had his hand in blood twice, or thrice, by men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by him in severall Duels, and now being condemned to die with the rest, upon very great fute made for him, he was hither Banished with them, whither the <HI>justice</HI> of Almighty God was dispatched after him, as it were in a <HI>Whirlwind,</HI> and followed him close at the very heels, and overtook him, and left him not till he had payd dear for that blood he had formerly spilt. This
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
<HI>Cross</HI> was a very stout, and a very resolute man▪ who quarrelling with, and abusing the Natives; and engaging himself farre amongst them, im∣mediatly after himself with the rest were left in that place, many of these Salvages being go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> together, fell upon him, and with their <HI>Darts</HI> thrown, and <HI>Arrows</HI> shot at him, stuck his body so full of them, as if he had been <HI>Larded</HI> with <HI>Darts</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> making him look like the Figure of the man in the <HI>Almanack,</HI> that seems to be wounded in every part, or like that man described by <HI>Lucan, totum pro vulnere corpus,</HI> Who was all wound, where <HI>blood touched blood.</HI> The retaliations of the Lord are sure and just; Hee that is mercy it self abhorrs cruelty above all other sins; Hee cannot endure that one man should devour another, as the <HI>Beasts</HI> of the field, <HI>Birds</HI> of the ayr, <HI>Fishes</HI> of the Sea doe, and therefore usually shewes, exemplary, signall re∣venges for that sin of Blood, selling it at a dear rate unto them that shed it. Every sin hath a tongue, but that of blood our-cryes; and drowns the rest; Blood being a clamorous, and a restless suter, whose mouth will not be stopt▪ till it re∣ceive an answer, as it did here. The other seven, the rest of these miserable <HI>Bandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI> who were there with <HI>Cross,</HI> recovered their Boat, and go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off the shore, without any great hurt, and so row∣ing to their Island, the waves running high, they split their boat at their landing, which engaged them to keep in that place, they having now no
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
possible means left to stirre thence. And which made their condition while they were in it most extremely miserable, it is a place wherein growes never a tree, either for sustenance or shelter, or shade, nor any thing beside (I ever heard of) to help sustein nature; a place that hath never a drop of fresh water in it, but what the showrs leave in the holes of the rocks. And besides all this, there are a very great number of Snakes in that Island (as I have been told by many that have been upon it) so many of those venemous worms that a man cannot tread safely in the long grasse which growes in it, for fear of them; And all these put together must needs make that place beyond measure uncomfortable to these most wretched men. To this may be added their want of provision having nothing but dry Bis∣ket, and no great quantity of that; so that they lived with hungry bellies, without any place fit for repose, without any quiet rest, for they could not choose but sleep in fear continually; And what outward condition could make men more miserable than this? Yet notwithstanding all they suffered, these seven vile wretches, all live to be made examples afterward of Divine Justice. For after they had continued in, and endured this sad place for the space of five or six moneths, and they were grown all even almost mad by reason of their several pressing wants and extremities, it pleased
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
God by providence, to bring an English Ship into that road, returning for <HI>England;</HI> four of these 7. men being impatient of anymore hours staythere, immediatly after that ship was come in, made a <HI>float</HI> with the ruines of their split boat, which they had saved togither, and with other wood which they had gotten thither, and with raveld and un∣twisted boat-roapes, fastned as well as they could all together (for there are no such sudden teach∣ers and instructers as extremities are) These four got upon the <HI>Float,</HI> which they had thus prepa∣red, and poysing it as well as they could by their severall weight, hoped by the benefit of their Oares, and strength of the tyde, (that then ran quick toward the ship newly arrived) they might recover it; but this their expectation failed them, for it being late in the day when they made this attempt, and they not discovered by the ship, which then road a good way up in the Bay, be∣fore they could come up neer unto her, the tyde return'd, and so carried them back into the main Sea where they all perished miserably. The day following, the ship sent a boat to the Island, which took those three yet surviving into her, as the other four might have been, if they could but have exercised their patience for one night lon∣ger; these survivers came aboard the ship, related all that had befallen to their fellows; But these three notwithstanding all their former miseries, when they were taken into the ship, behaved

That when the rod is upon a man, if he be not <HI>taught</HI> as well as <HI>chastned;</HI> all the stripes bestowed on him are cast away.

<P>The year following we carried three more condemned persons to be left in this place, but they hearing of the ill successe of their predeces∣sors, and that it was very unlikely for them to find any safe footing here, when we were ready to depart thence, and to leave them on the shore, they all came and presented themselves on their knees, with many tears in their eyes unto our chief Commander Captain <HI>Joseph,</HI> most hum∣bly beseeching him, that he would give order that they might be <HI>hanged</HI> before he departed, in that <HI>place,</HI> which they much rather chose, than to be there left; wee thought it was a very sad sight to behold three men in such a condition, that made them esteem <HI>hanging to be mercy.</HI> Our Com∣mander told them, that he had no Commission to execute them, but to leave them there, and so he must doe, and so believed he had done; But our fift ship the <HI>Swan</HI> staying in this place after us a day or two, took these poor men into her, and then took her course for <HI>Bantam</HI> whither she was bound. And the <HI>Rose</HI> our last ship, whose sight and company we lost in that most violent
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
storm (before mentioned) at the beginning of our voyage was safely preserved, and happily af∣terward found her way to <HI>Bantam</HI> likewise.</P>
<P>Wee made our abode in this Harbour till the 28th following, on which day we being well watered, and refreshed, departed. And the 29th we doubled the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> whose Lati∣tude is 35 <HI>Degree</HI> South. Off this <HI>Cape</HI> there setteth continually a most violent Current Westward, whence it comes to pass, that when a strong contrary wind meets it (as often-times it doth) their impetuons opposition makes the Sea so to rage, as that some ships have been swal∣lowed, but many more very much endangered amongst those huge mountains of water, and very few ships pass that way without a storm. We kept on in a circular course, to gain a South-west wind; for yee must know, that the wind in those parts, and so in <HI>East-India,</HI> blows (and but with a very little variation) half the year South-west, and the other half North-East; we sayled here Southerly, till we had raised the <HI>South-Pole</HI> almost forty degrees above the Horizon. This <HI>Pole</HI> is a Constellation of four starrs, the Ma∣riners call the <HI>Crosiers,</HI> these starrs appear neer one another like a <HI>Cross,</HI> and almost equidistant. And while we had the view of this <HI>Pole,</HI> the Sun (as it must needs be) was North at Noon un∣to us.</P>
<P>The 22. of <HI>July</HI> we discovered the great
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dagascar,</HI> Commonly called St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> we being then betwixt it and the <HI>African</HI> Shore, which Iland lies almost every part of it unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or within the Southern <HI>Tropick:</HI> we touched not at it, but this I dare say, from the Credit of others who have been upon it, that as it is an exceeding great Iland (if not the greatest in the known world) So is it stored with abundance of very excellent good Provisi∣ons, though inhabited by a barbarous and heathenish people, but stout, and warlike, and very numerous.</P>
<P>Over against this Iland, on the main Con∣tinent of <HI>Africa,</HI> are <HI>Zef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la,</HI> and <HI>Mozambique,</HI> whereon the Portugals have got some footing; the places (as may be strongly sup∣posed) whither <HI>Solomon</HI> sent his Navy of Ships, built at <HI>Eziongeber,</HI> which stood on the banks of the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d-Sea</HI> in <HI>Arabia</HI> the <HI>Happy,</HI> the Countrey of that famous <HI>Queen</HI> of the <HI>South,</HI> who hearing of the wisdome, and renown, took her journey thence to visit the Court of King <HI>Solomon, who had understanding like a flood.</HI> From that place forenamed, <HI>Solomon</HI> sent his Ships <HI>for gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vory, &amp;c.</HI> 1 Ki. 10, 22. they Coasting all along the shore of <HI>Africa;</HI> for in the dayes of <HI>Solomon</HI> the Art of Navigation was not known, and Sea-men then steering without <HI>Cart</HI> or <HI>Com∣pass</HI> were necessitated to keep the neighbouring
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
Land alwayes in their sights, as without questi∣on those ships did, and to those forementioned places, stored (as is related) above other Parts of <HI>Africa.</HI> with those richest Commodities.</P>
<P>I might have taken notice before, (but yet it will not be unseasonable) of many suddain, strong and violent <HI>Gusts</HI> of wind frequently to be observed in those-South-west Seas which sur∣prize a Ship so suddainly, that if she have ma∣ny sayles abroad, and the Mariners be not very watchfull, and Nimble to strike them their strength is such, that they will endanger her over∣turning And to these there are many strange wa∣tery Clouds they Call <HI>Spouts,</HI> which appear like a <HI>Funnel,</HI> or water tankard, very large and big at the one end but small on the other which hangs lowest and of a very great length; They Contain a great Quantity of water wrapt to∣gether by a <HI>whirl-wind,</HI> that falls within a very narrow Compass, the abundance whereof by 'its great weight, if it fall directly (as sometimes it doth) upon the body of a small ship, it will much endanger it and would do much more harm but that these <HI>Spouts</HI> when they are seen, may be easily avoided.</P>
<P>From the Iland <HI>Madagascar</HI> we proceeded on in our Course, and the 5 of <HI>August</HI> follow∣ing approached neer the little Ilands of <HI>Mohi∣lia, Gazidia,</HI> St. <HI>John de Castro,</HI> with some o∣thers, whose Names I have not, called in general
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
the Ilands of <HI>Comora,</HI> lying about 12. Degrees South of the <HI>Equator.</HI></P>
<P>The day following being the 6 of <HI>August,</HI> early in the morning our men looking out for Land espied a sail which stood directly in our Course. but far before us; at first sight she ap∣peared, as if there had been some great hill in∣terposed betwixt us: for first, we had sight only of her Colours in her high <HI>Maintop,</HI> af∣ter this, of her <HI>Masts</HI> and <HI>Sailes,</HI> and then of her <HI>Hull;</HI> after which manner, ships at Sea do every where appear at great distance one to another, which proves that that mighty Col∣lection of waters called Seas, have a <HI>Convex,</HI> or Globous and round body placed by Almigh∣tie God, as it were in <HI>Hills,</HI> or <HI>Heaps,</HI> and being above the earth, and higher than it, they have set <HI>Limits,</HI> and Commanded they are to their <HI>Bounas,</HI> contrary to their Nature, which they may not passe, for to saith the Psalmist, <HI>Ps. 104. 9 Thou hast set a bound which they may not passe over, that they return not again to Co∣ver the earth.</HI> But this is known to all that have been at sea, therefore we proceed. Upon the first sight of that ship, we were all glad of the object. improving all endeavours we could to overtake her withall preparing our great ordnance, that if she were a <HI>Friend</HI> we might salute her▪ if an <HI>Enemy</HI> be in readinesse for her. so eagerly pursuing this unlooked for ship with
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
the wings of the wind, after that we had gi∣ven her Chase about five howers, her Colours and bulk discovered her to be a very great Por∣tugal <HI>Caraque</HI> bound for <HI>Goa,</HI> lying in the Skirts of <HI>East-India,</HI> and principally inhabited by Portugals, the Citie of Residence for the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> her Comman∣der called <HI>Don Emanuel de Meneces,</HI> a brave resolute man, as the sequent will demonstrate. About noon the <HI>Globe</HI> our least ship (by reason of her Nimblenesse sailing better than her fel∣lows) came up with her on her broad side to windward, and according to the Custome of the Sea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayl'd her, asking whence she was; she answered indirectly of the Sea, calling our men <HI>Rogues, Theev, Hereticks, Devils,</HI> and the Conclusion of her rude Complement was, in loud <HI>Cannon</HI> language, discharging se∣ven great Peeces of Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lrey at our <HI>Globe</HI> (though she had very little reason so to do, we having four ships in Company, and she alone) whereof six pierced her through the <HI>Hull,</HI> maim∣ing some of her men, but killing none Our <HI>Globe</HI> replied in the same voice, and after that fel of.</P>
<P>About three of the Clock in the afternoon, the <HI>Charls</HI> our Admiral came up with her so near, that we were within pistoll shot, our Commaunder Captain <HI>Joseph</HI> proceeded re∣ligiously, in offering them a treaty, before he
<PB N="37" REF="34"/>
proceeded to revenge; So we saluted her with our <HI>Trumpets,</HI> she us with her wind <HI>Instru∣ments,</HI> then we shewed our men on both sides aloft; this done, our Commander called to them requiring <HI>Theirs</HI> to come aboard to give an account for the injury they had lately before offered us; they answered, they had never a boat; our <HI>Commaunder</HI> replyed that he would send them one, and immediately cansed his <HI>Barge</HI> to be man'd, and sent off to them, which brought back one of their officers▪ and two o∣thers of inferiour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank, with this message from their <HI>Captain,</HI> how that he had promised the King of <HI>Spain</HI> his Master not to leave his Ship, and therefore forc'd he might, but never would be Commanded out of her. <HI>Captain Joseph</HI> received the message, and used those that brought it Civilly, and then ordered, that they should be shewed (in a broad side of great Guns, that lay all ready p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im'd to be sir'd a∣gainst them) how we were prepared to vindi∣cate our selves, which put the poor <HI>Portugals</HI> into a fit of trembling, and upon it desir'd out <HI>Commander</HI> to write a few words to theirs that happily with their perswasion might make him come, <HI>Captain Joseph.</HI> willing to preserve his honour▪ and to prevent blood, consented, and forthwith caused a few lines in <HI>Spanish</HI> to this effect to be wrot unto him▪ That.</P>
<P>Whereas he <HI>the Commander</HI> of the <HI>Carraque</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>
had offered violence to our ship that saild peaceably by him, he wil'd him to come pre∣sently, and give reason for that wrong, or else at his perill.</P>
<P>So he discharged those <HI>Portugals▪</HI> sending one of our Masters Mates back with them, with those few words▪ and this further message, that if he refused to come, he would sink by his side, but that he would force him before he left him; <HI>Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entium verb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sunt prophetica,</HI> his words came to passe, for he himself suddainly after, fell by a great <HI>Shot</HI> that came from the <HI>Caraques</HI> side. The <HI>Commander</HI> of the <HI>Caraque</HI> not∣withstanding the Message, and Menace sent to him, was still peremptory in his first answer; So our men returning, <HI>Captain Joseph</HI> himself made the three first <HI>Shot</HI> at them, all which, the mark being so fair, and neer, hit them; this done, the bullets began to fly on both sides, our <HI>Captain</HI> Cheering his Company immediate∣ly ascended the half-<HI>Deck,</HI> the place where <HI>Commanders</HI> use to keep in those encounters, to shew their own galantry▪ and to encourage the Company under their Command where he had not been the Eighth part of an hower, ere a great <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot</HI> from the <HI>Caraques</HI> quarter deprived him of life in the twinkling of an eye. For this <HI>Captain Joseph,</HI> he was certainly one, who had very much of a Man in him for years antient, who had commanded before in <HI>Sea∣sights,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="35"/>
which he met withall, within the <HI>streights</HI> in the <HI>Madland Sea,</HI> and neer death, ma∣ny times in them, which took others round about him, while himself went off untouched, and the Reason was, because his appointed time for dy∣ing was not yet come.

<P>Yet as <HI>Sophocles</HI> sometimes spake of <HI>Philo∣ctetes,</HI> that he killed others glorioussy when he was slam himself: So the blood of this resolute <HI>Commander</HI> was more than sufficiently reveng∣ed, as will appear by the Consequence in the fall and Ruine of most of his provoking enemies.</P>
<P>After <HI>Captain Joseph</HI> was slain, the Master of our ship continued the fight about half an hower, then (knowing there was another to be admitted into that prime place of <HI>Command)</HI> the night approaching, for that time gave over, putting out a flag of Counsel to call the <HI>Cap∣tain</HI> of the vice Admiral <HI>(Capt: Henry Pep∣well)</HI> who was to succeed, and the other <HI>Com∣manders</HI> aboard to consult about the prosecuti∣on of this encounter. The night being come, we now proceeded no further. The <HI>Caraque</HI> stood still on her Course, putting forth a light at her <HI>Poop</HI> for us to follow her▪ and about midnight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame to an Anker under the Iland of <HI>Mohilia,</HI>

which when we perceived, we let fall our An∣kers to.</P>
<P>The seaventh early before it began to dawn, we prepared for a new assault first Commending our selves in <HI>Prayer</HI> to Almighty <HI>God,</HI> who doth whatsoever he pleaseth <HI>in Heaven, and in Earth, in the Sea, and in all places, Ps.</HI> 135. 6. towards the close of which exercise, I spake some words of exhortation, and encouragment, to all the people of the ship there together assembled; But was presently out-<HI>Rhetorick'd</HI> by our New <HI>Commander,</HI> who spake to the Company thus; My master's, I have never a speech to make unto you, but to speak to the <HI>Cooper</HI> to give every one of you a good Cup of <HI>Sack▪</HI> and so God blesse us. Here was a speech indeed that was Short and Sweet▪ that had somthing following it▪ to make it most savoury, that it might be tasted, as well as heard.

<P>The morning come we found the <HI>Caraque</HI> so close to the <HI>Shore</HI> and the nearest if our ships at least a league off that we held our hands for that day expecting when she would weigh her Ankers and stand off to Sea, a fitter place to deal wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h her. And that afternoon, we chested our late slain <HI>Commander</HI> putting some great shot with him into it that he might presently sink, and without any Ceremony of <HI>Guns, &amp;c.</HI>

<P>A little before night that present day the <HI>Ca∣raque</HI> departed again to <HI>Sea,</HI> we all loosed our <HI>Ankers,</HI> opened our <HI>Sayles,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollowed. The day now left us and our proud <HI>Adver∣sary</HI> unwilling as it should seem to escape, put forth a light (as before) for us to follow him, (as afterward we did to purpose) The night well∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> spent we commended again our selves and cause to God, when I observed more seem∣ing devotion in our <HI>Sea-men</HI> that morning, than at any time before, or after while I kept them company; who, for the generality are such a kind of <HI>people</HI> that nothing will bow them, to bring them on their knees, but extream <HI>Hazads.</HI> When this exercise was ended the day began to appear in a <HI>red ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> which prov'd <HI>bloud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> unto many that beheld it. And now we entred upon a second encounter, our
<PB N="43" REF="37"/>
four ships resolving to take their turns one after the other, that we might compel this proud <HI>Portugal</HI> either to bend, or break.</P>
<P>But before I shall give an account of our further engagement. I will take notice of two accidents which to me seemed very observable, and exemplary; the first this, there was one in our ship whose Sir name was <HI>Raven</HI> (a ser∣vant to our late slain <HI>Commander)</HI> who imme∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately before we began to engage, came to me and told me that he had a very great de∣sire to follow his <HI>Master;</HI> with what mind he spake this I know not, but if hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ly and with desire his speech was very all for if it be an ex∣treme madnesse for a man to intreat God▪ to take away the life of his <HI>Beast,</HI> much more to request him to take away his own <HI>Life.</HI> But whatsoever his Petition was in respect of his inward desire it pleased Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghev God pre∣sently to answer him herein, by the first great <HI>Shot</HI> that came from the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>my,</HI> which strook off his <HI>Head.</HI> Aman may hope to speed <HI>well,</HI> that knows how to Peti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on <HI>well▪</HI> but by the Righteous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgment of God it oftentimes fall out, that such unadvised <HI>requests,</HI> meet with a return of most sad, and unwelcome <HI>an∣swers</HI></P>
<P>There was another a <HI>Taylor</HI> (but not in our ship) who while the Company he sailed with, were engaged, brought his pressing▪ iron to
<PB N="44" REF="38"/>
one of the <HI>Gunners,</HI> and desired him to put it into a Peece of <HI>Ordnance</HI> already laden, telling him that he would send it as a token to the <HI>Por∣tugals,</HI> withall swearing that he would never work again at his trade; it pleased God imme∣diately after to sentence him out of his own mouth, and <HI>to let his tongue to fall upon him∣self,</HI> for that great <HI>Peece</HI> was no sooner dis∣charged, but a great <HI>Bullet</HI> was returned from the enemy, which strook him dead.</P>
<P>And now Reader thou mayest suppose us speaking again to our adversary, and he to us, in the harshest and lowdest of all <HI>Dialects,</HI> no arguments being so strong as those that proceed from the mouths of <HI>Guns,</HI> and <HI>Points</HI> of <HI>Swords.</HI> Our <HI>Charles</HI> the Admiral played her part first, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e she had been at defyance with her ene∣my half an hower there came another great shot from him, which hitting against one of our iron <HI>Peeces</HI> mounted on our half <HI>Deck,</HI> brak into many little parts, which most dan∣gerously wounded our New <HI>Commander,</HI> and the <HI>Master</HI> of our ship▪ with <HI>three</HI> others be∣side, who received several hurts by it. Captain <HI>Pepwels</HI> left <HI>Eye,</HI> by a glance of a <HI>Peec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of that broken bullet, was so <HI>Torn</HI> that it lay like <HI>Raggs</HI> upon his cheek; another hurt by a peece of the same bullet, he received on his <HI>Jaw-bone,</HI> and by another, on his <HI>Head,</HI> and a fourth hurt he received in his <HI>Leg,</HI> a ragged peece of that
<PB N="45" REF="38"/>
broken shot sticking fast betwixt the two bones thereof, grating there upon an Artery, which seemed by his complayning to afflict him so much, that it made him take very little notice of all the rest of his <HI>Hurts,</HI> it being most true of bodily Pains, that the extremity of a greater pain will not suffer a man much to feel and complain of that which is lesse, as that tor∣men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing pain by the <HI>Toot-ach,</HI> makes a man insensible of the a king of his head▪ and when the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Stone</HI> surprise the Body at once together, the torture by the <HI>Gout</HI> is as it were lost in the extremity of the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>And thus was our new <HI>Commander</HI> wel∣comed to his Authority; we all thought that his wounds would very suddainly have made an end of him, but he lived till about fourteen Moneths after, and then <HI>Dyed</HI> as he was re∣turning for <HI>England.</HI> I told you before, that this man suffered not alone by the scattered peeces of that broken shot, for the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Ship</HI> had a great peece of the Brawn of his <HI>Arm</HI> strook off by it, which made him likewise unserviceable for a time, and <HI>three</HI> other of the Common sailers received several and dangerous hurts by it likewise.</P>
<P>The Captain and Master both thus disabled, deputed their Authority to the chief Masters mate, who behaved himself resolutely and wisely; so we continued <HI>Alternis vicibus</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="39"/>
one after the other, shooting at our <HI>adversary,</HI> as at a <HI>But,</HI> and by three of the clock in the af∣ter noon had shot down Her <HI>Main-mast</HI> by the board her <HI>Mizen-masts,</HI> her <HI>fore top mast,</HI> and moreover had made such breaches in her thick sides▪ that her case seemed so des∣perate as that she must either <HI>yeild,</HI> or <HI>perish.</HI> Her <HI>Captain</HI> thus distressed stood in for the shore being not far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Iland of <HI>Gaziaia;</HI> we pursued as sar as we durst without hazard of Ship wrack then we sent off a Boat with a flag of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uce</HI> to speak with him, He waved us with another, upon which Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onnick</HI> our chief Merchant imployed in that service came up to them and being invited, entred their ship, where he was civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly used, and there he deliver∣ed this Message to the chief <HI>Commander,</HI> and his Company, that he had brought them <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Peace.</HI> if they would accept it, withall tel∣ling them that they had deserved so well by their undaunted valour, that if they would put themselves into our hands, they should be en∣tertained with all honour and respect; how, the Ordinary sort in the <HI>Caraque</HI> were taken with this profer I know not, yet all this would not work upon that high-resolv'd <HI>Commander,</HI> who like <HI>Fabr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ly</HI> could not be turn'd in the least measure, from his <HI>former</HI> and <HI>firm</HI> resolution, But</P>

<P>So he contemning the <HI>Misery</HI> he could not <HI>prevent;</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> like a prun'd <HI>hedge</HI> which growes stronger by Cutting answering our meffenger thus that no infelicity should make him alter his first resolution, and therefore must not be talk't out of the ship; That he would stand off to Sea if possibly he could and fight us again, and then if <HI>fire,</HI> or <HI>sword</HI> forc'd him, he might un∣happily be taken but he would never yield, and if we took him alive he hoped to find the respect of a Gentleman, and till then we had our answer. So our Meffenger was dis∣charged, and shortly after, this distressed Ship wanting her <HI>wings,</HI> was forc'd by the wind and waves upon the adjacent Iland of <HI>Gazidi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where she stuck fast between two Rock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: those that were left alive in her, by their boats got upon the shore, which when they had all re∣covered, willing (as it should seem) to destroy what they could not keep, they set her on fire to

make her a <HI>Coal,</HI> rather than we should make her a <HI>Prize.</HI> She was a ship of an Exceeding great value in <HI>Coyn</HI> and <HI>Bullion,</HI> besides many other rich commodities▪ (if report afterward abused us not) but we got nothing from her but <HI>blows,</HI> for which she was repayed by us with <HI>Ruin.</HI> The poor distres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <HI>Portugalls</HI> after they had left their Ship were most inhumanly used by the barbarous Islanders, who spoyled them of all they brought on shore for their suc∣cour, some of them finding Death in the place they chose to escape, it and doubtless they had made havock of them all, had they not presently been relieved by two <HI>Arabian Junks</HI> (for so their small ill built ships are called) there in Trade; which, in hope I suppose of some great reward, took them in, and conveyed them safely to their own City <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>In this Sea-fight we lost, out of our four ships but five men; three out of our Admirall, and two out of the <HI>James</HI> besides we had a∣bout twenty in our whole Fleet hurt. But of seven hundred which sayled in the <HI>Carrague,</HI> (for she was a Ship of an exceeding great bulk and burthen our <HI>Charls,</HI> though a ship of a thousand Tunns, looking but like a <HI>Pinace</HI> when she was beside her) there came not near half her Company to <HI>Goa</HI> as afterward we were informed.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Charles</HI> in this opposition made at her
<PB N="49" REF="40"/>
adversary for her part, three hundred seventy and five great Shot (as our Gunners reported) to these we had one <HI>Hundred▪</HI> Musquetiers that plyed them with small shot all that <HI>while;</HI> neither was our Enemy Idle, for our ship received from him at least one hundred great <HI>shot,</HI> and many of them dangerous ones, through the <HI>Hull▪</HI> Our <HI>fore-mast</HI> was <HI>peirced</HI> through the mid∣dle, our <HI>Main-mast</HI> hurt, our <HI>Main-stay</HI> almost spoyled, and many of our <HI>Main-shrouds</HI> cut asunder.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Reader,</HI> thou hast the sum of that <HI>sea∣encounter,</HI> which I did the rather insert, because I believe that of all warlike oppositions there are none that carry more horror in them than Sea-<HI>Fights</HI> do, if the parties engaged be both very resolute, as very many who use the Sea are, who will desperatly run upon the mouth of a <HI>Cannon,</HI> rush into the very <HI>jawes</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> be∣fore they have at all learned what it was to live; that being most true, which was antiently ob∣served in the generality both of <HI>souldiers,</HI> and <HI>Sea-men, Armatis Divûm nullus timor,</HI> that they fear neither <HI>God</HI> nor <HI>Man.</HI> And therefore when I seriously consider of the terrours which usually accompany this kind of fighting, I do more pity and less wonder at the behaviour of a poor <HI>Scotch Merchant</HI> in such an encounter, who observing the Bullets to make quick re∣turns, gets into his Cabin, and there covered
<PB N="50" REF="41"/>
himself as close as he could; but being pursued thither by his own tears, which he could not keep thence, they made his lower Passages both to open, and then feeling himself in those parts more warm and moyst than usually he was, cried out. <HI>Ice slene, Ice slene, Ice all goar blud;</HI> yet when he was searched his hurts proved not mortal. But in good earnest, there is no oppo∣sition in the World so full of dread as this, and no Contentions 'twixt men and men carry them so far out of themselves, and make them turn so savage, as these.</P>
<Q><L>Where men act Wolves parts, where their high∣est skill</L>
<L>Expressed is by knowledge how to kill;</L>
<L>One Bullet throws a Leg into the Main,</L>
<L>An Arm that follows it, as if again</L>

<L>And at his feet there others gasp a dying:</L>
<L>Here goes an Head, and there an Heart is made</L>
<L>Its lodging to forsake, and fly to's shade.</L>
<L>Of all Encounters there are none so fell</L>
<L>As Fights at Sea, where nought but Horrors dwell.</L>
<L>Mongst all the Arts of Killing none more dire</L>
<L>Than these by Bullets, Wracks, Noyse, Sword and fire.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="51" REF="41"/>
I want words to express the extreme horror that is to be observed in these Sea-fights, where <HI>Fire</HI> like <HI>Lightning</HI> darts into mens <HI>Eyes,</HI> and the over-loud Cracks of great Ordnance like <HI>Thunder</HI> roars in their Ears, besides the Noyse made by <HI>Musquets, Drums</HI> and <HI>Fifes,</HI> with men hurrying up and down the Ship▪ in a con∣fused tumult, wrapt about in a thick Cloud of suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cating smoak made by the Powder. Here a <HI>Bullet</HI> comes and leaves Death behind it, and there <HI>Splinters</HI> kill or ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m others; so that a man in this Case is many times as if he were placed in the midst of a <HI>Beam</HI> holding two <HI>Bal∣lances,</HI> where the one <HI>Scale</HI> hangs over the <HI>Fire,</HI> and over the <HI>Water</HI> the other: For it often fals out in these Encounters, that by sink∣ing or firing a Ship a man is put to this most miserable choyce, either to <HI>Burn</HI> or <HI>Drown;</HI> and in these extremities there is no escaping by flight, as in <HI>Field-Battels.</HI> And therefore though it be easy and safe to <HI>sail in the Harbour,</HI> or to sit upon the shore, and there to make these most sad Conflicts matter of talk, discourse or, merri∣ment as some do, yet I conceive they should not be seen or heard of without <HI>grief</HI> and <HI>de∣testation:</HI> Because the very name of a <HI>man</HI> im∣plies <HI>Humanity,</HI> which a man forgets to shew, when he sees or hears of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uine and destructi∣on of others with Content, who are men like himself. It is well observed, that Almighty God
<PB N="52" REF="42"/>
in Scripture shewing mercy is oftentimes called by the name of a <HI>Man,</HI> as <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 24. &amp; 29▪ <HI>A Man wrestled with</HI> Jacob <HI>and blessed him.</HI> So in many other places. But when God threa∣tens displeasure and vengeance against a man, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, <HI>I will not meet thee as a man,</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 47. 3. that is, he will shew no pity, no compassion. Which implies thus much, that they who at any time are wanting in this, deserve not the names of <HI>Men,</HI> they being <HI>without natural affections;</HI> Appearing to be such, as if they had been hewen from the <HI>Rocks,</HI> and not fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Loyns of flesh and blood; as if they had <HI>sucked the Dra∣gons in the Wilderness,</HI> rather than the Daugh∣ters of Men. But to conclude what I have to say of this; If it be very terrible (as indeed it is) to be in the midst of such Encounters as these, though a man come off untouched, it is much more to smart under the sad consequences thereof; It being by much more hard to <HI>feel,</HI> than it is easy to <HI>talk</HI> of them.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Reader,</HI> if thou shalt be pleased to accompany me further, I shall carry thee from this sad discourse, where we may be both re∣freshed upon a near rich and pleasant Iland; And to make way for our entertainment there, take further notice, that after we saw the <HI>Car∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>que</HI> in a flame (which was about midnight) we stood <HI>off</HI> and <HI>on</HI> till morning, to see if any thing might be found in her Ashes; of which
<PB N="53" REF="42"/>
when we despaired, we sought about to <HI>succour</HI> and <HI>comfort</HI> our wounded and sick <HI>men</HI> on the shore. The Land there was very high, against which the Sea is alwaies deep; so that it was the tenth day of that month <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re we could be possessed of a good Harbour; which en∣joyed, we found the Iland called <HI>Moh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> very pleasant, full of Trees, and exceeding fruitful, abounding in <HI>Beeves, Kids, Poultrey</HI> of divers kinds, <HI>Rice, Sugar-Canes, Plantens</HI> (of which Fruit more shall be spoken hereafter) <HI>Oranges, Coquer-nuts,</HI> as with many other wholsome things, of all which we had sufficient to relieve our whole Company, for little quantities of <HI>White Paper, Glass Beads,</HI> low prized <HI>Looking-Glasses,</HI> and cheap <HI>Knives.</HI> For instance▪ we bought as many good <HI>Oranges</HI> as would fill an Hat for one quarter of a shee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of white writing-<HI>Paper,</HI> and so in proportion all other Pro∣visions.</P>
<P>Here we had the best <HI>Oranges</HI> that ever I tasted, which were little round ones▪ exceeding sweet and juicie, having but a little s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e skin within them, and the rinde on them almost as thin as the paring of an Apple: We eat all together, Rinde and Juice, and found them a Fruit that was extraordinary well pleasing to the Tast.</P>
<P>Much of their Fruits the Ilanders brought unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in their little <HI>Canoos</HI> (which are long narrow
<PB N="54" REF="43"/>
boats, but like troughs out of firm trees) but their Cattel we bought on the shore; Where I observed the people to be streight, well limm'd, stout, able men, their colour very <HI>tawney;</HI> most of the men, but all the women, I saw un∣cloathed, having nothing about them but a Co∣vering for their <HI>shame.</HI> Such as were cloathed had long Garments like unto the <HI>Arabians,</HI> whose Language they speak, and of whose Re∣ligion they are, <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> very strict (as it should seem) for they would not endure us to come near their <HI>Churches.</HI> They have good convenient <HI>Houses</HI> for their Living, and fair <HI>Se∣pulchres</HI> for their Dead.</P>
<P>They seemed to live strictly under the Obe∣dience of a <HI>King,</HI> whose place of residence was some miles up in the Countrey; His leave by Messengers they first craved, before they would sell unto us any of their better Provisions. Their <HI>King</HI> hearing of our arrival, bad us welcome by a Present of <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves,</HI> and <HI>Goats,</HI> and <HI>Poultrey,</HI> and the chief and choyce <HI>Fruits</HI> of his Coun∣trey, and was highly recompenced as he thought again, by a <HI>Quire</HI> or two of white <HI>Paper,</HI> a pair of low prized <HI>Looking-Glasses,</HI> some strings of Glass <HI>Beads,</HI> some cheap Knives, and with some other English toyes</P>
<P>We saw some Spanish Money amongst them, of which they seemed to make so little reckon∣ing, that some of our men had from them many
<PB N="55" REF="43"/>
<HI>Royals</HI> of Eight in exchange for a little of those very low and very cheap Commodities which before I named.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coquer-nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tree</HI> (of which this Iland hath abundance) of all other Trees may challenge the preheminence: for, meerly with these Trees, without the least help of any other Timber, or any other thing (unless a little Iron-work) a man may <HI>build,</HI> and <HI>furnish,</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>victual</HI> a small Ship to Sea.

<P>Now well-stored with these <HI>Nuts</HI> and other good Provisions, after six daies abode there; the breaches our Ship had lately received in fight

being repaired, and our men well refreshed, we put again to Sea the sixteenth day, and a pro∣sperous gale following us, were carried happily a second time under the <HI>Aequinoctial,</HI> without the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st heat to offend us, the 24 day of the same Month. Our Course was for the Iland of <HI>Zocotora</HI> near the mouth of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> from whence comes our <HI>Aloes Zocotrina;</HI> but an adverse gale from the <HI>Arabian</HI> shore kept us so off that we could by no means recover it. We passed by it the first of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>Missing that Fort we proceeded on our Voyage, and the fourth of <HI>September</HI> made a solemn <HI>Fu∣neral</HI> in memory of our late slain <HI>Commander,</HI> when after Sermon the small Shot and great Ordnance made a large Peal to his Remem∣brance.</P>
<P>On the sixt of <HI>September</HI> at night, to our admiration and fear, the <HI>Water</HI> of the <HI>Sea</HI> seem∣ed to us as white as milk, which did not appear onely so in the body of the Sea, but it looked so likewise in <HI>Buckets</HI> of water which we did then draw out of the Sea. Others of our Nari∣on passing on that Course have observed the like: but I am yet to learn what should be the true reason thereof, it being there very far from any shore, and the Sea so deep as that we could fetch no ground.</P>
<P>The 21. we discovered the main Continent of <HI>Asia</HI> the Great, in which <HI>East-India</HI> takes
<PB N="57" REF="44"/>
up a large part. The 22. we had sight of <HI>Deu</HI> and <HI>Damon,</HI> places that lye in the skirts of <HI>India,</HI> principally inhabited and well fortified by <HI>Portugals;</HI> and the 25 of <HI>September</HI> we came happily to an Anchor in <HI>Swally-Road</HI> within the <HI>Bay of Cambaya,</HI> the Harbour for our Fleet while they make their stay in these remote Parts.</P>
<P>Then after a long, and troublesome, and dangerous passage, we came at last to our de∣sired Port. And immediately after my arrival there, I was sent for by Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> Lord Embassadour, then residing at the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court (which was very many miles up in the Countrey) to supply the room of Mr. <HI>John Hall</HI> his Chaplain (Fellow of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Col∣lege in <HI>Oxford)</HI> whom he had not long before buried. And I lived with that most Noble Gentleman at that Court more than two years, after which I returned home to <HI>England</HI> with him. During which space of my abode there I had very good advantage to take notice of very many <HI>places,</HI> and <HI>persons,</HI> and <HI>thing,</HI> tra∣velling with the Embassadour much in Progress with that King up and down his very large Ter∣ritories.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Reader.</HI> I would have thee to sup∣pose me setting my foot upon the <HI>East-Indian</HI> shore at <HI>Swally</HI> before named. On the banks whereof, amongst many more English that lye
<PB N="58" REF="45"/>
there interred, is laid up the body of Mr. <HI>Thomas▪ Coryat,</HI> a man in his time <HI>Not us nimis omni∣bus,</HI> very sufficiently known. He lived there, and there died while I was in those parts, and was for some Months then with my Lord Em∣bassadour, during which time he was either my Chamber-fellow or Tent-mate, which gave me a full acquaintance of him. That <HI>Greek∣travelling-Thomas</HI> (they which know his story know why I call him so▪) formerly wrote a Book entituled <HI>Coryats <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ies,</HI> Printed in the be∣ginning of the year 1611. and then ushered into the World by very many Copies of excel∣lent Verses made by the Wits of those Times, which did very much advantage and improve, if not enforce the sale thereof (doing themselves much more honor than him whom they under∣took to commend in their several <HI>Encomiasticks)</HI> And if he had lived, he would have written his last Travels to, and in, and out of <HI>East-India,</HI> for he resolved (if God had spared him life) to have rambled up &amp; down the world (as some∣times <HI>Ulysses</HI> did) and though not so long as he, yet ten full years at least before his return home, in which time he purposed to see <HI>Tartaria</HI> in the vast parts thereof, with as much as he could of <HI>China,</HI> and those other large Places and Pro∣vinces interposed betwixt <HI>East-India</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> whose true Names we might have had from him, but yet have not. He had a purpose after
<PB N="59" REF="45"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his to have visited the Court of <HI>Prester John</HI> in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> who is there called by his own people, <HI>Ho B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, The King;</HI> and after this it was in his thoughts to have cast his eyes upon many other places; which if he had done, and lived to write those Relations, seeing as he did, or should, such variety of <HI>Countries, Cities, Na∣tions, Things,</HI> and been as particular in them as he was in his <HI>Venetian Journal,</HI> they must needs have swoln into so many huge Volumns, as would have prevented the perishing of Paper. But undoubtedly, if he had been continued in life to have written them, there might have been made very good Use of his Observations; for as he was a very <HI>Particular,</HI> so was he without question a very <HI>Faithful Relator</HI> of things he saw; he ever disclaiming that bold liberty which divers Travellers have, and do take, by <HI>speaking</HI> and <HI>writing</HI> any thing they please of remote parts, when they cannot easily be <HI>contradicted,</HI> taking a Pride in their feigned Relations, to overspeak things; being resolved in this case
<Q><L>Not onely things to do, but or'-do;</L>
<L>Speaking, writing all, and more too:</L></Q>
I therefore for my part, believing this <HI>Relaton</HI> to be none of those▪ have taken some things from his trust and credit in this my following
<PB N="60" REF="46"/>
Discourse; And because he could not live to give an account unto the world of his own Travels, I shall here by the way make some little discovery of his footsteps and flittings up and down, to and fro, with something besides of him, in his long peregrinations, to satisfie very many yet living, who if they shall please to read this Discourse, may recall that man once more into their remembrance, who while he lived was like a perpetual motion, and there∣fore now dead should not be quite for∣gotten.</P>
<P>In the year 1612. he shipt himself from <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> now called by the Turks <HI>Stombole,</HI> where he took special notice of all things there most observable. In which place he found very great respect, and encou∣ragement from Sir <HI>Paul Pinder,</HI> then and there Embassadour, to whose House he had free and welcom access whensoever he pleased. Being there for some time, he took his opportunities to view divers parts in <HI>Grecia;</HI> and in the <HI>Hel∣lespont</HI> took special notice of those two Castles directly opposed to each other, called <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos,</HI> which stand on the several banks that bound that very narrow Sea; which Places <HI>Musaeus</HI> makes famous in his very an∣tient Poem of <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Leander.</HI></P>
<P>He desired much to see where those seven Churches sometimes famous in <HI>Asia</HI> the Less
<PB N="61" REF="46"/>
stood; but since their sin so darkned their light, and God removed their <HI>Candlesticks</HI> from them (as before he threatned) those Places lye so in the dark, that it cannot be well discovered where they once were: Onely <HI>Smyrna</HI> is fa∣mous at this present day for <HI>Trade,</HI> but not <HI>Re∣ligion;</HI> and <HI>Ephesus</HI> and some others of them keep their names still, though they left and lost their <HI>Faith,</HI> and profession of <HI>Truth,</HI> with the rest.</P>
<P>He saw what yet remains of the Ruins of sometimes great <HI>Troy,</HI> but
<Q><L>Jam Seges est ubi Troia fuit—</L></Q>
That place which was once so populous as if it had been sow'n with People,
<Q><L>And seeded thus, had after born</L>
<L>Millions of men, now's sow'n with Corn. <HI>And</HI></L></Q>
<HI>—O jam periere Ruinae,</HI> the very Ruins of that place are almost all gone to Ruine: The most observable thing there yet remaining is part of an exceeding great <HI>House,</HI> which is con∣tinued by Tradition to have been sometimes a part of the famous <HI>Palace</HI> of great King <HI>Priamus.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Smyrna</HI> he found a Passage to <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Egypt</HI> that is called by some in
<PB N="62" REF="47"/>
regard of the Plenty it produceth, the <HI>Granary</HI> or <HI>Storehouse</HI> of the World. And in <HI>Egypt</HI> near <HI>Gran-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iro</HI> (antiently called <HI>Memphis)</HI> he ob∣served what remains of the once fam'd <HI>Pyra∣mids.</HI> Returning thence back to <HI>Alexandria</HI> with one Englishman more, they found a pass by Sea to <HI>Jatta▪</HI> antiently called <HI>Joppa,</HI> and there they met some others going to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which is about twenty English miles distant from <HI>Joppa,</HI> whence they departed together to∣wards <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and found it a very solitary, rocky, uncomfortable way, full of danger, by reason of the wild <HI>Arabs</HI> who keep about those Passages to make poor Travellers their <HI>prey</HI> and <HI>spoyl.</HI> But they came safe to <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> now inhabited by <HI>Turks,</HI> and that place called by them <HI>Cutts;</HI> where he told me, that himself and his Companion were courteously received by the <HI>Father Guardian</HI> of the <HI>Convent</HI> of <HI>Franciscan Friars</HI> that keep their residence in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and by some of them were met at the Gate of the City, where they were compel∣led by the Turkish Souldiers who keep those Gates (as all others that bear the names of Christians, are) at their first coming thither to redeem their <HI>heads</HI> by paying each of them the value of <HI>five shillings,</HI> before they could have admittance into that place; which they had no sooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d▪ but they were presently carried by those <HI>Franciscans</HI> which met them to their
<PB N="63" REF="47"/>
<HI>Convent;</HI> and then the first thing they did to or for them, they washed their feet, then set some comfortable refection before them, and after went in <HI>Procession</HI> about a little Cloyster they had, praising God that he had brought in safety those two <HI>Votaries</HI> (as they called them) to visit that Holy Place. A day or two after they ac∣companied them to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> the place of our <HI>Blessed Saviours birth,</HI> about five English miles distant from <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and in the way be∣twixt those two places shewed them a Rock, on which (as they said) the <HI>Blessed Virgin</HI> sate down, as she went on a time betwixt <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> to give her <HI>Babe</HI> suck; and that the <HI>Rock</HI> might not feel <HI>hard</HI> under <HI>her,</HI> it yielded (as they told them) to her <HI>body</HI> like a <HI>Cushion,</HI> and that impression made by her so sit∣ting remaineth unto this day; and is most de∣voutly kissed by Votaries as they pass up and down. After this they returning back shewed them all that was to be seen in and about <HI>Jeru∣salem.</HI> Many particulars they told them (sto∣ries which are there kept by Tradition) con∣cerning our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> and his Mother: Then they had a sight of as much of Mount <HI>Cal∣varie</HI> (where our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> suffered) as could be shewed them, that Hill being now en∣closed within the Wals of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> They undertook to shew them afterwards the place wherein our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> was buried; and

after that upon Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> the very place whence he after ascended, where upon a Rock there was an <HI>impression</HI> of the former part of two <HI>feet,</HI> such as is seen in soft earth, when a man lifts up his body to leap thence; and these <HI>Franciscans</HI> confidently affirmed, and seemed undoubtedly to believe, that it was so as they shewed and told them. Many other things they affirmed, which being but Circumstantials, (though appertaining to the best of all <HI>stories)</HI> were enough for these Pilgrims to <HI>believe,</HI> and enough to make <HI>doubt of.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Jerusalem</HI> this our Traveller had made upon the <HI>Wrists</HI> of his left <HI>Arm</HI> the Arms of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> a <HI>Cross Crossed,</HI> or <HI>Crosslets;</HI> and on the <HI>Wrist</HI> of his <HI>right,</HI> a single <HI>Cross</HI> made like that our Blessed Saviour suffered on; and on the sides of the <HI>stem</HI> or <HI>tree</HI> of that <HI>Cross</HI> these words written, <HI>Via, Veritas, Vita▪</HI> some of the letters being put on the one side of that stem or tree, and some of them on the other; and at the foot of that <HI>Cross</HI> three <HI>Nails,</HI> to signifie those which fastned our <HI>Saviour</HI> unto it: All these impressions were made by sharp <HI>Needles</HI> bound together, that pierced onely the skin, and then a black Powder put into the Places so pierced, which became presently indelible <HI>Cha∣racters,</HI> to continue with him so long as his flesh should be covered with <HI>skin:</HI> And they were done upon his Arms so artificially, as if they had
<PB N="65" REF="48"/>
been drawn by some accurate Pencil upon Parchment. This poor man would pride him∣self very much in the beholding of those Cha∣racters, and seeing them would often speak those words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> written to the <HI>Galati∣ans, Gal.</HI> 6. 17. (though far besides the Apo∣stles meaning) <HI>I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Now after that himself and Camrade had seen what they desired in and about <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> they took their leave of those <HI>Franciscans,</HI> lea∣ving with them money to recompence the cur∣tesy they had received from them; the <HI>Friars</HI> being very poor, and consequently unable to en∣tertain them freely without requitals.</P>
<P>From hence they took their way to take a view of the <HI>Dead Sea</HI> (so called, either because the water therein is still, and moves not, or be∣cause no living Creature is in it, and nothing thrives on the banks thereof) the place where <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and <HI>Admah</HI> and <HI>Ze∣boim</HI> once stood, those Cities <HI>which Almighty God overthrew in anger, and repented not,</HI> Jer. 20. 16. Hence they went to have a sight of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> which dischargeth it self into that most uncomfortable <HI>Lake;</HI> and from hence they journied <HI>North-east</HI> through those <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> (which for the sin of <HI>Salomon</HI> were rent from his son <HI>Rehoboam)</HI> till they came to Mount <HI>Li∣banus.</HI> Thence back to <HI>Sidon,</HI> which retaineth
<PB N="66" REF="49"/>
that name still. And here he told me as his last observation made in that Land of <HI>Ca∣uaan,</HI> sometimes <HI>(like the Garden of the Lord)</HI> flowing with <HI>milk and honey,</HI> being then en∣riched with a very great variety, and abundance of Gods good Creatures; and in the daies of <HI>David</HI> so populous, that there were numbred in it at one time <HI>thirteen hundred thousand fighting men,</HI> 2 Sam. 24. 9. besides Women and Children, and others unfit to draw swords; which was a most wonderful thing, to consider that such a spot of ground in comparison, not above one <HI>hundred</HI> and <HI>sixty</HI> miles in length, from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beersheba,</HI> and not above <HI>sixty</HI> miles in bredth, from <HI>Joppa</HI> to <HI>Jordan,</HI> should be able to bear and feed such a numerous people; and now the very self-same tract of Earth, either for want of manuring, or (which is rather to be conceived) for the want of the blessing of Almighty God which once shined upon it, but now long since withdrawn from it, <HI>(For a fruitful Land the Lord makes barren for the wickedness of them that dwell therein,</HI> Psal. 107. 34.) is now become unable to sustein one in an hundred of such a number.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sidon</HI> they got a passage by Sea unto <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> now called <HI>Scanderoon</HI> (in the extremest bottom of the <HI>Mediterranean Sea)</HI> which is one of the unwholsomest places in the World; where I have often heard that no
<PB N="67" REF="49"/>
Stranger (that was born far from it) comes to continue there for the space of one Month, but is sure to meet with a sickness, which very often proves Mortal. At this place his English Com∣panion left him, and turned his face towards <HI>England,</HI> and he presently took his way towards <HI>Aleppo</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> about seventy miles or more distant from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> which is as much re∣nowned for wholsomness, as the place before∣named for being unwholsome; and therfore it is called, <HI>sweet-air'd Aleppo.</HI> Here he being kindly received by the <HI>English Consul,</HI> stayed a time to gain the company of a <HI>Carava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which consists of a great mixt multitude of people from divers parts, which get and keep together travelling those parts, for fear of the incursions and vio∣lences by <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Murtherers,</HI> which they would undoubtedly meet withall, if they tra∣velled single, or but few together. With these he after set forwards towards, and to that City antiently called <HI>Nineveh</HI> in <HI>Assyria,</HI> which we find in the Prophesie of <HI>Jonah</HI> was sometimes <HI>a great and excellent City of three daies journey,</HI> Jonah 3. 3. but now so exceedingly lessen'd and lodg'd in obscurity, that passengers cannot say of it, <HI>this was Nineveh,</HI> which now hath its old name changed, and is called <HI>Mozel.</HI> From hence they journied to <HI>Babylon</HI> in <HI>Chaldaea,</HI> si∣tuated upon the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> once likewise so great that <HI>Aristotle</HI> called it a <HI>Countrey,</HI> not
<PB REF="50"/>
a <HI>City,</HI> but now it is very much contracted, and 'tis called <HI>Bagdat.</HI> From this place they pro∣ceeded through both the <HI>Armeniaes,</HI> and either did, or else our Traveller was made to believe, that he saw the very Mountain <HI>Ararat</HI> whereon the <HI>Ark of Noah rested after the Flood,</HI> Gen. 8. And from hence they went forward to∣wards the Kingdome of <HI>Persia,</HI> and there to <HI>Uzspahan,</HI> the usual place of residence for that great King, then called <HI>Sha Abbas,</HI> or <HI>King Abbas.</HI> And after they went to <HI>Seras,</HI> an∣tiently called <HI>Shushan,</HI> where the <HI>great King Ahasuerus</HI> kept his Royal and most Magnifi∣cent Court, <HI>Est.</HI> 1 From hence they journied afterwards to <HI>Candahor,</HI> the first Province North east under the subjection of the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> and so to <HI>Lahore</HI> the chiefest City but one belonging to that great Empire; a place, as I have been often told by <HI>Tom: Coryat</HI> and others of very great <HI>trade, wealth</HI> and <HI>delight,</HI> lying more temperately out of the Parching Sun than any other of his great Cities do: And to this City he wanted not Company, nor afterwards to <HI>Agra,</HI> the <HI>Mogol's Metropolis</HI> or chief City.</P>
<P>And here it is very observable, that from <HI>La∣hore</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> it is four hundred English miles, &amp; that the Countrey betwixt both these great Ci∣ties is rich, even, pleasant and flat, a <HI>Campania;</HI> and the rode-way on both sides all this long di∣stance
<PB N="69" REF="50"/>
planted with great <HI>Trees</HI> which are all the year cloathed with leaves exceeding beneficial unto Travellers for the shade they afford them in those hot Climes. This very much extended length of way 'twixt these two places is called by Travellers the <HI>Long Walk,</HI> very full of <HI>Vil∣lages</HI> and <HI>Towns</HI> for Passengers every where to find Provision.</P>
<P>At <HI>Agra</HI> our Traveller made an halt, being there lovingly received in the <HI>English Factory,</HI> where he staid till he had gotten to his <HI>Turkish,</HI> and <HI>Morisco</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, some good knowledge in the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Indostan Tongues,</HI> in which study he was alwaies very apt. and in little time showed much proficiency. The first of those two, the <HI>Persian,</HI> is the more <HI>quaint;</HI> the other, the <HI>Indostan,</HI> the vulgar <HI>Language</HI> spoken in <HI>East-India:</HI> In both these he sud∣denly got such a knowledge and mastery, that it did exceedingly afterwards advantage him in his Travels up and down the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Territo∣ries, he wearing alwaies the <HI>Habit</HI> of that Na∣tion, and speaking their <HI>Language.</HI></P>
<P>In the first of these, the <HI>Persian</HI> tongue, he made afterwards an <HI>Oration</HI> to the Great <HI>Mo∣gol,</HI> bringing in that Story of the <HI>Queen of She∣ba,</HI> 1 King. 10. (in which parts of that Sacred Historic the Mahumetans have some know∣ledge) and he told him, that as the <HI>Queen of Sheba</HI> having heard of the fame of King <HI>Salo∣mon,</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="51"/>
came from far to visit him, which when she had done, she confessed that though she had heard very much of him and many things be∣yond her belief, yet now seeing what she did, acknowledged that she had not heard half of that which she now saw concerning the <HI>Wis∣dome,</HI> and <HI>Greatness,</HI> and <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inue,</HI> and <HI>Riches of Salomon:</HI> So our <HI>Orator</HI> told the <HI>Mogol,</HI> that he had heard very much of him before he had the Honour to see him (when he was very far off in his own Countrey) but now what he beheld did exceedingly surmount all those for∣mer Reports of him which came to his ears at such a distance from him: Then larding his short Speech with some other pieces of Flat∣tery, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> liked well, conclu∣ded: And when he had done, the <HI>Mogol</HI> gave him one hundred <HI>Roopus,</HI> which amounts to the value of <HI>twelve pounds</HI> and <HI>ten shillings</HI> of of our English Money; looking upon him as a <HI>Derveese,</HI> or Votary, or Pilgrim (for so he called him) and such as bear that name in that Coun∣trey seem not much to care for money, and that was the reason (I conceive) that he gave him not a more plentiful Reward.</P>
<P>After this he having got a great mastery like∣wise in the <HI>Indostan</HI> or more vulgar Language, there was a woman, a Landress, belonging to my Lord <HI>Embassadors house,</HI> who had such a freedome and liberty of speech, that she would
<PB N="71" REF="51"/>
sometimes scould, brawl and rail from the <HI>Sun-rising</HI> to <HI>Sun-set;</HI> one day he undertook her in her own language, and by <HI>eight</HI> of the clock in the morning so <HI>silenced her,</HI> that she had not one word more to speak.</P>
<P>I shall have occasion to say more of this man in some passages of this following Discourse, and therefore shall not wrap all I have to speak of him in this, although it be a very long di∣gression: Yet because I must now shortly bring you to his journies end, I shall take the freedome to enlarge my self a little further concerning him here in this place, before I leave him for the present; and to give thee, <HI>Reader,</HI> a piece of his <HI>Character,</HI> it speaks thus:</P>
<P>That he was a man of a very coveting <HI>eye, that could never be satisfied with seeing,</HI> as <HI>Salomon</HI> speaks, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 1. 8. though he had seen very much; and I am perswaded that he took as much content in <HI>seeing,</HI> as many others in the <HI>en∣joying</HI> of <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Rare</HI> things. He was a man that had got the mastery of many hard Langua∣ges (as before I observed) to the <HI>Latine</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> he brought forth of <HI>England</HI> with him; in which, if he had obtained wisdome to hus∣band and manage them as he had skill to speak them, he had deserved more fame in his gene∣ration. But his knowledge and high attain∣ments in several Languages made him not a little ignorant of himself, he being so covetous,
<PB N="72" REF="52"/>
so ambitious of <HI>praise,</HI> that he would <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>endure</HI> more of it than he could in any measure <HI>deserve;</HI> being like a Ship that hath too much <HI>Sail,</HI> and too little <HI>Ballast:</HI> Yet if he had not fall'n into the smart hands of the Wits of those Times, he might have passed better. That itch of <HI>Fame</HI> which engaged this man to the under∣takings of those very hard, and long, and dan∣gerous Travels, hath put thousands more (and therefore he was not alone in this) into strange attempts onely to be talked of.</P>
<P>One long ago <HI>built</HI> a Temple to <HI>Diana</HI> in hope of <HI>Glory,</HI> intending it for one of the Great Wonders of the World; Another after in hope of <HI>Fame burnt</HI> it. Whither will not the thirst of <HI>Fame</HI> carry men! It hath made some seek to climbe up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> though by a wrong way: Thus the Builders of <HI>Babel</HI> say one to another, <HI>Let us build us a City, and a Tower, whose top may reach up to Heaven, and let us make us a Name,</HI> Gen. 11. 4 And it hath made others, who are <HI>penurious</HI> of their <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>prodigal</HI> of their <HI>Souls,</HI> not fear to run down headlong into <HI>Hell.</HI> 'Twas <HI>Fame,</HI> without doubt, that stirred up this man unto these voluntary, but hard underta∣kings, and the Hope of that <HI>Glory</HI> which he should reap after he had finished his long <HI>Tra∣vels,</HI> made him not at all to take notice of the <HI>hardship he found in them.</HI> That hope of name and repute for the time to come did even feed
<PB N="73" REF="52"/>
and feast him for the time present. And there∣fore any thing that did in any measure <HI>eclipse him</HI> in those high conceivings of his own worth, did too too much <HI>trouble him,</HI> which you may collect from these following instances.</P>
<P>Upon a time one Mr. <HI>Richard Steel</HI> a Mer∣chant and servant to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, came unto us from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Mandoa,</HI> the place then of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s residence (of which place somewhat more hereafter) at which time Mr. <HI>Coryat</HI> was there with us▪ This Merchant had not long before travelled over-land from <HI>East-India,</HI> through <HI>Persia,</HI> and so to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and so for <HI>England;</HI> who in his travel home∣ward had met with <HI>Tom: Coryat,</HI> as he was journeying towards <HI>East-India;</HI> Mr. <HI>Steel</HI> then told him, that when he was in <HI>England, King James</HI> (then living) enquired after him, and when he had certified the King of his meeting him on the way, the King replied, <HI>Is that Fool yet living?</HI> which, when our <HI>Pilgrim</HI> heard, it seemed to <HI>trouble</HI> him very much, because the King spake no <HI>more</HI> nor no <HI>better</HI> of him; saying, that <HI>Kings</HI> would speak of poor men what they pleased.</P>
<P>At another time when he was ready to de∣part from us, my Lord <HI>Embassadour</HI> gave him a Letter, and in that a Bill to receive ten pounds at <HI>Aleppo</HI> when he should return thither: The Letter was directed unto Mr. <HI>Libbeus Chapman,</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="53"/>
there <HI>Consul</HI> at that time, in which that which concerned our Traveller was thus: Mr. <HI>Chap∣man,</HI> when you shall hand these Letters, I desire you to receive the Bearer of them, Mr. <HI>Thomas Coryat,</HI> with curtesy, for you shall find him a very honest poor Wretch; and further I must in∣treat you to furnish him with ten pounds, which shall be repayed, &amp;c. Our <HI>Pilgrim</HI> lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d tho gift <HI>well,</HI> but the <HI>language</HI> by which he should have received it did not <HI>at all</HI> content him, telling me, That <HI>my Lord had, even spoyled his curtesy in the carriage thereof; so that if he had been a very Fool indeed, he could have said very little less of him than he did, Honest poor Wretch!</HI> and to say no more of him was to say as much as nothing. And furthermore he then told me, that when he was formerly undertaking his journey to <HI>Venice,</HI> a Person of Honour wrote thus in his behalf unto Sir <HI>Henry Wott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> then and there <HI>Embassodour: My Lord,</HI> Good Wine needs no Bush, neither a Worthy man Letters Commendatory, because whithersoever he comes he is his own Epistle, &amp;c. <HI>There</HI> (said he) <HI>was some language on my behalf; but now for my Lord to write nothing of me by way of Com∣mendation, but Honest poor Wretch, is rather to trouble me than to please me with his favour.</HI> And therefore afterwards his Letter was phras'd up to his mind, but he never liv'd to receive the money. By which his old acquaintance may see
<PB N="75" REF="53"/>
how tender this poor man was to be <HI>touched</HI> in any thing that might in the least measure <HI>dis∣parago</HI> him. O what pains this poor man took to make himself a Subject for present and after discourse! being troubled at nothing for the present, unless with the fear of not living to reap that fruit he was so ambitious of in all his undertakings. And certainly he was surprized with some such <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>fears</HI> (for so he told us afterwards) when upon a time he being at <HI>Mandoa</HI> with us, and there standing in a room against a stone <HI>Pillar,</HI> where the Embas∣sadour was, and my self present with them, up∣on a sudden he fell into such a <HI>swoon,</HI> that we had very much ado to recover him out of it; but at last, come to himself, he told us that some sad <HI>thoughts</HI> had immediately before pre∣sented themselves to his <HI>Fancy,</HI> which as he conceived put him into that <HI>distemper;</HI> like <HI>Fannius</HI> in <HI>Martial—Ne moriare mori,</HI> to prevent death by dying: For he told us that there were great Expectations in <HI>England</HI> of the large Accounts he should give of his Tra∣vels after his return home; and that he was now shortly to leave us, and he being at present not very well, if he should dye in the way to∣ward <HI>Surat,</HI> whither he was now intended to go, (which place he had not as yet seen) he might be buried in Obscurity, and none of his Friends ever know what became of him, he
<PB N="76" REF="54"/>
travelling now, as he usually did, alone. Upon which my <HI>Lord</HI> willed him to stay longer with us, but he thankfully refused that offer, and turned his face presently after towards <HI>Surat,</HI> which was then about three hundred miles di∣stant from us, and he lived to come safely thi∣ther: but there being <HI>over-kindly</HI> used by some of the English who gave him <HI>Sack,</HI> which they had brought from <HI>England,</HI> he calling for it as soon as he first heard of it, and crying, <HI>Sack, Sack:</HI> Is there such a thing as <HI>Sack!</HI> I pray give me some <HI>Sack:</HI> and drinking of it, though, I conceive, moderately (for he was a very tem∣perate man) it increased his <HI>Flux</HI> which he had then upon him; and this caused him within a few daies after his very tedious and troublesome Travels (for he went most on foot) at this place to come to his Journies end; for here he over∣took Death in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> 1617. and was buried (as a foresaid) under a little <HI>Mo∣nument,</HI> like one of those are usually made in our <HI>Church-yards:</HI> On which he should have been remembred by this or the like <HI>Epitaph,</HI> if it could have been there engraved upon his <HI>Tombe.</HI></P>

<L>Here lies the Wanderer of his age,</L>

him. And shall now proceed to give an ac∣count of what I have undertaken, and do prin∣cipally intend in the description of the large <HI>Territories</HI> under the subjection of the Great <HI>Mogol.</HI> Which following Discourse (that I may put it into, and after continue it in some due order) I shall digest into several Parts or Sections: As,</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the several Provinces, the chief Ci∣ties, the Principal Rivers, the extent of this vast Empire in its length and bredth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE most spacious Monarchy under the subjection of the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> divides it self into thirty and seven several and large Pro∣vinces, which antiently were particular King∣domes, whose true Names (which we there had out of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s own Records) with their Principal <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> their <HI>Situation</HI> and <HI>Borders,</HI> their <HI>Extent</HI> in length and bredth, I shall first set down very briefly, beginning at the North-west. Yet as I name these several <HI>Provinces,</HI> I shall by the way take notice of some particulars in them which are most re∣markable.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="79" REF="55"/>
1. <HI>Candahore,</HI> the chief City so called; it lyes from the heart of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Territories North-west; it confines with the King of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> and was antiently a Province belonging to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cabut,</HI> the chief City so called, the ex∣tremest part North of this Emperours Domini∣ons; it confineth with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artaria;</HI> the River <HI>Nilob</HI> hath its beginning in it, whose Current is Southerly till it dischargeth it self into <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Multan,</HI> the chief City so called; it lyeth South from <HI>Cabut</HI> and <HI>Candahore,</HI> and to the West joyns with <HI>Persia.</HI> This Province is fam'd for many excellent Bowes and Arrowes made in it: The Bowes made of Horn; excellently glued and put together; the Arrows of small Canes or Reeds, both of them curiously set off by rich <HI>Paint</HI> and <HI>Varnish:</HI> They which are made here are more neat and good than in any part of <HI>East-India</HI> besides.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Haiacan,</HI> the Province of the <HI>Baloches,</HI> who are a very stout and warlike people that dare fight. I insert this, because there are in∣finite multitudes of people in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Terri∣tories who appear as likely as these, but so low∣spirited (as I shall after observe) that they dare not sight. This Province hath no renowned City. The famous River <HI>Indus</HI> (called by the Inhabitants <HI>Skind)</HI> borders it on the East;
<PB N="80" REF="56"/>
and <HI>Lar,</HI> a Province belonging to the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> meets it on the West.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Buckor,</HI> the chief City called <HI>Buckor-Succor;</HI> that famous River <HI>Indus</HI> makes its way through it, and gently enricheth it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Tatta,</HI> the chief City so called; the River <HI>Indus</HI> makes many Islands in it exceeding fruit∣ful and pleasant, the Main Current whereof meets with the Sea at <HI>Sinde,</HI> a place very fa∣mous for many curious <HI>Handicrafts.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Soret,</HI> the chief City is called <HI>Janagar;</HI> it is but a little Province yet very rich; it lyes upon <HI>Guzarat;</HI> it hath the Ocean to the South.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Jesselmure,</HI> the chief City so called; it joyneth with <HI>Soret;</HI> but <HI>Buckor</HI> and <HI>Tatta</HI> lye to the West thereof.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttack,</HI> the chief City so called; it lyeth on the East side of <HI>Indus,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Hai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>can.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Peniab,</HI> which signifieth five Waters, for that it is seated amongst five Rivers, all Tri∣butaries to <HI>Indus;</HI> which, somewhat South of <HI>Labore,</HI> make but one Current: It is a large Province; and most fruitful. <HI>Lahore</HI> is the chief City thereof, built very large, and abounds both in people and riches, one of the most prin∣cipal Cities for Trade in all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Chishm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere,</HI> the chief City called <HI>Sira∣nakar;</HI> the River <HI>Bhat</HI> finds a way through it,

though it be very mountainous, and so creeps to the Sea.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Banchish,</HI> the chief City is called <HI>Bishur;</HI> it lyeth East, somewhat Southerly from <HI>Chish∣meere,</HI> from which it is divided by the River <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Jangapore,</HI> the chief City so called; it lyeth upon the River <HI>Kaul,</HI> one of those five Rivers which water <HI>Peniab.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Jenba,</HI> the chief City so called; it lyeth East of <HI>Peniab.</HI></P>

<PB N="90" REF="61"/>
made by theespecial observation &amp; direction of that most able and honourable Gentleman Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> here contracted into a less <HI>compass;</HI> yet large enough to demonstrate, that this great <HI>Empire</HI> is bounded on the <HI>East</HI> with the King∣dome of <HI>Maug; West,</HI> with <HI>Persia;</HI> and with the Main Ocean <HI>Southerly; North</HI> with the Moun∣tain <HI>Caucasus</HI> and <HI>Tartaria, South</HI> with <HI>Decan</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Bengala. Decan,</HI> lying in the skirts of <HI>Asia,</HI> is divided betwixt three <HI>Mahu∣meran Princes,</HI> and some other Indian <HI>Rhaiaes,</HI> which are Princes likewise.</P>
<P>The length of these Provinces is <HI>North-west</HI> to <HI>South-west</HI> more than <HI>two thousand</HI> English miles; <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> the extent thereof is about <HI>fourteen hundred</HI> miles; the Southermost part lying in twenty, and the Northernmost in forty and three degrees of North Latitude.</P>

<PB N="92" REF="62"/>
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Soyl there, what it is, and what it produceth, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis most spacious and fertile Monarchy (called by the Inhabitants <HI>Indostan)</HI> so much abounds in all necessaries for the use and service of man, to <HI>feed,</HI> and <HI>cloath,</HI> and <HI>enrich</HI> him, as that it is able to subsist and flourish of it self, without the least help from any Neighbour-Prince or Nation.</P>
<P>Here I shall speak first of that which Nature requires most, <HI>Food,</HI> which this Empire brings forth in abundance; as, singular good <HI>Wheat, Rice, Barley,</HI> with divers more kinds of good <HI>Grain</HI> to make Bread (the staff of life) and all these sorts of Corn in their kinds, very good and exceeding cheap. For their <HI>Wheat,</HI> it is more <HI>full</HI> and more <HI>white</HI> than ours, of which the In∣habitants make such pure, well-relished Bread, that I may say of it, as one sometimes spake of the Bread made in the <HI>Bishoprick of Leige,</HI> it is <HI>Panis Pane melior,</HI> Bread better than Bread.</P>
<P>The ordinary sort of people eat Bread made of a coarser Grain, but both <HI>toothsome,</HI> and <HI>whol∣some,</HI> and <HI>hearty;</HI> they make it up in broad <HI>Cakes,</HI> thick like our <HI>Oaten-cakes;</HI> and then bake it upon small round iron <HI>hearths,</HI> which
<PB N="93" REF="62"/>
they carry with them when they journey from place to place, making use of them in their <HI>Tents.</HI> It should seem to be an antient Cu∣stome in the East, as may appear by that pre∣sident of <HI>Sarah</HI> when she entertained the Angels, who found her in her Tent; <HI>She took fine meal, and did knead it, and made Cakes thereof upon the hearth,</HI> Gen. 18. 6.</P>
<P>To their Bread they have great abundance of all other good Provision, as of <HI>Butter</HI> (beat∣ing their Cream into a substance like unto a thick Oyl, for in that hot <HI>Climate</HI> they can ne∣ver make it hard) which though soft, yet it is very sweet and good. They have <HI>Cheese</HI> like∣wise in plenty, by reason of their great number of <HI>Kine,</HI> and <HI>Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Goats.</HI> Besides, they have a Beast very large, having a smooth thick skin without hair, called a <HI>Buffelo,</HI> which gives good milk; the flesh of them is like <HI>Beef,</HI> but neither so toothsome nor wholsome. These <HI>Buffeloes</HI> are much employed in carrying large skins of water (for they are very strong Beasts) which hang on both sides of them, unto Families that want it: their <HI>Hides</HI> make the most firm and excellent <HI>Buff.</HI></P>
<P>They have no want of <HI>Venison</HI> of divers kinds, as <HI>Red-Deer, Fallow-Deer, Elks</HI> (which are very large, and strong, and fierce Creatures) <HI>Antilops, Kids, &amp;c.</HI> but their <HI>Deer</HI> are no where imparked, the whole Empire being (as
<PB N="94" REF="63"/>
it were) a Forrest for them; for a man can travel no way but he shall here and there see of them. But because they are every mans Game that will make them so, they do not multiply to do them much hurt, either in their <HI>Corn,</HI> or other <HI>places.</HI></P>
<P>To these, they have great store of <HI>Hares,</HI> and they have plenty of <HI>Fowls wild</HI> and <HI>tame,</HI> as abundance of <HI>Hens, Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Partriches, Peacocks, Quails,</HI> and many other singular good <HI>Fowl.</HI> They have variety of <HI>Fish;</HI> all which, by reason of their Plenty. and because many of the Natives eat no kind of Flesh at all▪ nor of any thing that hath or may have life, and those that feed on such things eat not freely of any of those living Creatures they are all bought there at such easy rates, as if they were not worth the valuing. They do not cut their Chickens when they be little to make Capons, and therefore they have no Creatures of that name, but men, their Eunuchs called there <HI>Cogees</HI> or Capons in their Language: so made, when they be very young, and then deprived of all that might after pro∣voke jealousie; and therefore they are put to be attendants on their women, the great men of that Nation keeping many of them, a soft, tender people, <HI>tener Spado,</HI> as <HI>Juvenal</HI> cals one of them, that never come to have any <HI>Hair</HI> on their <HI>Faces.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="63"/>
But to return again to their Provisions, the <HI>Beeves</HI> of that Countrey differ from ours, in that there are none of them very large; and those they have, have each of them a great <HI>bunch</HI> of grisly flesh which grows upon the meeting of their <HI>shoulders.</HI> The <HI>flesh</HI> of their <HI>Beeves</HI> is much <HI>whiter</HI> than the flesh of <HI>ours,</HI> and very sweet, tender and good. Their <HI>Sheep</HI> differ from ours by their great fleshy <HI>Bob-tails,</HI> which se∣vered from their bodies are very ponderous. Their <HI>Wool</HI> is generally <HI>coarse,</HI> but their flesh is not so.</P>
<P>Now to season all their good Provisions, there is great store of <HI>Salt;</HI> and to sweeten all, abundance of <HI>Sugar</HI> growing in that Countrey; which, after it is well refined, may be there had at a very low rate; out of which they make very pure white <HI>Sugar-Candy,</HI> which may be had there at a small easy Price likewise.</P>
<P>Their Fruits are every way answerable to the rest, the Countrey abounding in <HI>Musk-Melons</HI> (very much better, because they are better di∣gested there by the heat of the Sun, than these with us) They have many <HI>Water-Melons,</HI> a very choyce good Fruit, and some of them as big as our ordinary <HI>Pompions,</HI> and in shape like them; the substance within this Fruit is spongie, but exceeding tender and well tasted, of a colour within equally mixed with <HI>red</HI> &amp; <HI>white,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="64"/>
and within that an excellent <HI>cooling</HI> and <HI>pleasing liquor.</HI> Here are likewise store of <HI>Pome-granats, Pome-citrons;</HI> here are <HI>Limons</HI> and <HI>Oranges,</HI> but I never found any there so good as I have seen elswhere. Here are <HI>Dates, Figs, Grapes, Prunelloes, Almonds, Coquernuts</HI> (of which I observed something before) and here they have those most excellent <HI>Plums</HI> called <HI>Mirabolans,</HI> the stone of which Fruit differs very much from others in its shape, whereon Nature hath cu∣riously quartered several strakes equally divided, very pretty to behold; many of which choyce <HI>Plums</HI> (they write) are very cordial, and there∣fore worth the prizing, are there well preserved, and sent for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>They have to these another Fruit we English there call a <HI>Planten,</HI> of which many of them grow in <HI>Clusters</HI> together; long they are in shape, made like unto slender <HI>Cucumbers,</HI> and very yellow when they are Ripe, and then tast like unto a <HI>Norwich Pear,</HI> but much better. Another most excellent Fruit they have, called a <HI>Manggo,</HI> growing upon Trees as big as our <HI>Walnut-trees;</HI> and as these here, so those Trees there, will be very full of that most excellent Fruit, in shape and colour like unto our <HI>Apri∣cocks,</HI> but much bigger; which taken and rolled in a mans hands when they are through ripe, the substance within them becomes like the <HI>pap</HI> of a <HI>roasted Apple,</HI> which then suck'd
<PB N="97" REF="64"/>
out from about a large stone they have within them, is delicately pleasing unto every <HI>Palate</HI> that tasts it. And to conclude with the best of all other their choyce Fruits, the <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anas,</HI> like unto our <HI>Pine-Apples,</HI> which seems to the Ta∣ster to be a most pleasing Compound made of <HI>Strawberies, Claret-wine, Rose-water</HI> and <HI>Sugar</HI> well tempered together. In the Northernmost parts of this Empire they have variety of <HI>Pears</HI> and <HI>Apples,</HI> every where good <HI>Roots,</HI> as <HI>Car∣rets, Potatoes,</HI> and others like them. They have <HI>Onions</HI> and <HI>Garlick,</HI> and some <HI>Herbs</HI> and small <HI>Roots</HI> for <HI>Salads;</HI> and in the Southern∣most parts, <HI>Ginger</HI> growing almost in every place: the large Races whereof are there very excellently well preserved, as we may know by our tasting them in <HI>England.</HI> And all these things I have last named may be there likewise bought at very low rates And lastly, some one kind or other of their very good and choyce Fruits may be there had at every time or season of the Year.</P>
<P>And here I cannot chuse but take notice of a very pleasant and clear liquor, called <HI>Toddie</HI> issuing from a Spongie Tree, that grows strait and tall without Bowes to the top, and there spreads out in tender branches, very like unto those that grow from the Roots of our rank and rich <HI>Artichokes,</HI> but much bigger and longer. This <HI>Toddie-tree</HI> is not so big, but that it may
<PB N="98" REF="65"/>
be very easily embraced, and the nimble people of that Countrey will climb up as fast to the top thereof (the stem of the Tree being rough and crusty) as if they had the advantage of Ladders to help them up. In the top tender branches of those Trees they make incisions, which they open and stop again as they please, under which they hang Pots made of large and light <HI>Gourds,</HI> to preserve the influence which issues out of them in a large quantity in the night season, they stopping up those vents in the heat of the day. That which thus distils forth in the night, if it be taken very early in the mor∣ning, is as pleasing to the tast as any new <HI>White∣wine,</HI> and much clearer than it. It is a very piercing, and medicinable, and moffensive drink, if taken betimes in the day, onely it is a little windy: but if it be kept till the heat of the day, the Sun alters it so, as if it made it an∣other kind of liquor, for it becomes then very heady, not so well relished, and unwholsome; and when it is so not a few of our drunken <HI>Sea-men</HI> chuse to drink it; and I think they so do, because it will then presently turn their brains; for there are too too many of the common sort of those men who use the Sea, who love those brutish distempers too much, which turn a man out of himself, and leave a Beast in the skin of a man. But for that drink, if it be taken in its best, and most proper season, I conceive it to be
<PB N="99" REF="65"/>
of it self very wholsome, because it provokes urine exceedingly; the further benefit whereof some there have found by happy experience, thereby eased from their torture inflicted, by that shame of Physicians, and Tyran of all Maladies, the <HI>Stone.</HI> And so cheap too is this most pleasing Wine, that a man may there have more than enough for a very little money.</P>
<P>At <HI>Surat,</HI> and so to <HI>Agra,</HI> and beyond, it seldome or never <HI>rains,</HI> but one season of the year; but yet there is a refreshing <HI>Dew</HI> during all that time <HI>the Heavens there are thus shut up,</HI> which every night fals, and <HI>cools,</HI> and <HI>com∣forts,</HI> and <HI>refresheth</HI> the face of the <HI>earth.</HI> Those general <HI>Rains</HI> begin near the time that the Sun comes to the Northern <HI>Tropick,</HI> and so con∣tinue till his return back to the <HI>Line.</HI> These showers at their beginning most extremely vio∣lent▪ are usher'd in▪ and usually take their leave with most fearful Tempests of <HI>Thunder. Light∣ning,</HI> more terrible than I can express, yet seldome do harm; the reason in Nature may be, the subtilty of the <HI>Air</HI> in those parts where∣in there are fewer <HI>Thunder-stones</HI> made, than in such <HI>Climates</HI> where the Air is <HI>thick, gross,</HI> and <HI>cloudy.</HI> During those three months it rains usually every day more or less, sometimes one whole quarter of the <HI>Moon</HI> together, scarce without any intermission; which abundance of moysture, with the heat of the Sun, doth so
<PB N="100" REF="66"/>
enrich their Land, which they never force (if I observed right) by Soyling of it, as that, like <HI>Egypt,</HI> by the inundation of <HI>Nilus,</HI> it makes it fruitful all the year after. When the time of this <HI>Rain</HI> is passed over, the face of the Skye there is presently so serene and clear, as that scarcely one <HI>Cloud</HI> appears in their <HI>Hemisphere</HI> the nine months after.</P>
<P>And here a strong Argument that may fur∣ther, and most infallibly shew the goodness of their Soyl, shall not escape my Pen, most ap∣parent in this, That when the Ground there hath been destitute of Rain nine months to∣gether, and looks all of it like the barren Sands in the Deserts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> where there is not one spire of green Grass to be found, within a few daies after those fat enriching showers begin to fall, the face of the Earth there (as it were by a new <HI>Resurrection)</HI> is so revived, and through∣out so renewed, as that it is presently covered all over with a pure <HI>green Mantle.</HI> And more∣over, to confirm that which before I observed concerning the goodness of that Soyl, amongst many hundred Acres of <HI>Corn</HI> of divers kinds I have there beheld, I never saw any but what was very <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> standing as thick on the Ground as the Land could well bear it.</P>
<P>They till their Ground with Oxen and Foot-Ploughs, their Seed-time in <HI>May,</HI> and the be∣ginning of <HI>June,</HI> they taking their time to dis∣patch
<PB N="101" REF="66"/>
all that work before that long Rainy sea∣son comes; and though the Ground then hath been all the time we named before without any sufficient moysture by showers, or otherwise, to supple and make it more fit for tilliage, yet the Soyl there is such a brittle fat mould (which they sow year after year) as that they can very easily till it. Their Harvest is in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> the most temperate months of all that year.</P>
<P>Their Ground is not enclosed, unless some small quanty near <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Villages,</HI> which stand scattered up and down this vast Empire very thick, though, for want of the true names, not inserted in the Map.</P>
<P>They mow not their Grass (as we) to make Hay, but cut it off the ground, either green, or withered, as they have occasion to use it.</P>
<P>They sow <HI>Tobacco</HI> in abundance, and they take it too very much, but after a strange way much different from us; for first, they have little Earthen Pots, shaped like our small <HI>Flower-pots,</HI> having a narrow neck, and an open round top, out of the belly of which comes a small spout, to the lower part of which spout they fill the Pot with water, then putting their <HI>Tobacco</HI> loose in the top, and a burning coal upon it, they having first fastned a very small strait hollow <HI>Cane</HI> or <HI>Reed</HI> (not bigger than a small Arrow) within that spout, a yard or ell
<PB N="102" REF="67"/>
long, the Pot standing on the ground, draw that smoak into their mouths, which first falls upon the Superficies of the water, and much dis∣colours it. And this way of taking their <HI>To∣bacco,</HI> they believe, makes it much more cool and wholsome. The <HI>Tobacco</HI> which grows there is doubtless in the Plant as good as in any other place of the world, but they know not how to cure and order it, like those in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to make it so rich and strong.</P>
<P>The Countrey is beautified with many <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Groves</HI> of Trees, in which those winged <HI>Choristers</HI> make sweet Musick. In those Woods some excellent <HI>Hawks</HI> make their nests, and there are very often to be seen great flocks of <HI>Parakeetoes,</HI> or little <HI>Parrats,</HI> who have their breeding and lodging amongst those Melancholy Shades. And (in the number of many other Creatures covered with Feathers) there are some very little Birds less than our <HI>Wrens,</HI> who are exceeding pretty, for their neat shape, and their covering, with most curious parti-colour'd Fea∣thers, full of variety of little spots. I have seen there many of those rare Creatures kept to∣gether in large Cages, who please the <HI>Eye</HI> with their curious <HI>Colours,</HI> and the <HI>Ear</HI> with their variety of pleasant <HI>Notes.</HI> The <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Groves</HI> in the Southernmost parts of <HI>Indostan,</HI> have great store of wild <HI>Apes,</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> and <HI>Baboons</HI> in them, some of which I have seen
<PB N="103" REF="67"/>
as high as our tallest <HI>Greyhounds,</HI> which live among the Trees, and climbe them at pleasure. Those <HI>Apes, &amp;c.</HI> are very terrible to those little Birds, which make their Nests in those Woods; and therefore Nature hath taught them this subtilty (to preserve their young ones from those Creatures which would otherwise destroy them) to build their Nests in the twigs, and the utmost boughs of those Trees, where some of them hang like little Purse-nets, to which those <HI>Apes</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> be they never so little and light, cannot come to hurt them.</P>
<P>Besides their Woods, they have great variety of fair goodly Trees that stand here and there single, but I never saw any there of those kinds of Trees which <HI>England</HI> affords. They have very many firm and strong Timber-trees for building, and other uses; but much of their brush, or small wood, I observed to be very <HI>sappie,</HI> so that when we brake a twig of it, there would come a substance out of some of it, like unto <HI>Milk,</HI> and the sappiness of that under∣wood may (as I apprehend it) be ascribed in part to the fatness of that Soyl. Some of their Trees have Leaves upon them broad as <HI>Bucklers,</HI> o∣thers are parted small like out <HI>Fern</HI> or <HI>Brakes,</HI> as the <HI>Tamerine</HI> Tree, which bears <HI>Gods</HI> some∣what like our <HI>Beans,</HI> in which when the Fruit is ripe, there is a very well tasted <HI>pulp,</HI> though it
<PB N="104" REF="68"/>
be sowr, most wholsome to open the body, and to cool and cleanse the blood.</P>
<P>There is one very great and fair Tree grow∣ing in that Soyl, of special observation, out of whose <HI>Branches</HI> or great <HI>Arms</HI> grow little <HI>Sprigs</HI> downward till they take <HI>Root</HI> (as they will certainly do if they be let alone) and ta∣king Root, at length prove strong supporters unto those large Branches that yield them. Whence it comes to pass, that those Trees in time (their strong and far-extended Arms being in many places thus supported) grow to a very great height, and extend themselves to such an incredible breadth, they growing round every way, as that hundreds of men may shade them∣selves under one of them at any time; the ra∣ther, because these, as all other Trees in those Southern parts of <HI>East-India</HI> (as particularly I observed before) still keep on their <HI>green Coats.</HI></P>
<P>For their <HI>Flowers,</HI> they are for the generality like unto painted <HI>Weeds,</HI> which, though their colour be excellent, they rather delight the <HI>eye</HI> than affect the <HI>smell;</HI> for not many of them, except <HI>Roses,</HI> and some few kinds more; are any whit fragrant: Amongst them that are, there is one white <HI>Flower,</HI> like to Spanish <HI>Jes∣samin</HI> (if it be not the same) which is exceeding∣ly well sented, of which they make a most ex∣cellent
<PB N="105" REF="68"/>
pure sweet <HI>Oyl,</HI> with which they anoynt their <HI>heads,</HI> and other parts of their bodies; which makes the company of those that do so very <HI>savoury</HI> and <HI>sweet.</HI></P>
<P>This Empire is watered with many goodly Rivers (as they are expressed in the Map) the two principal are <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges;</HI> where this thing is very observable (for they say there that it is very true) that one pint of the water of <HI>Ganges</HI> weigheth less by <HI>one ounce</HI> than any other water in that whole great <HI>Monarchy▪</HI> And therefore (they say) that the <HI>Mogol,</HI> where∣soever he is, hath water brought him from that <HI>River,</HI> that he may drink thereof, by some ap∣pointed for that service, who are continually either going to it, or coming from it: The wa∣ter is brought unto the <HI>King</HI> in fine <HI>Copper Jars,</HI> excellently well tin'd on the inside, and sealed up when they are delivered to the Water∣bearers for the <HI>King</HI>'s use; two of which <HI>Jars</HI> every one carries, hanging upon Slings fitted for the Porter's shoulders.</P>
<P>Besides their Rivers, they have store of <HI>Wels</HI> fed with Springs; and to these, they have many <HI>Ponds,</HI> which they call <HI>Tanques,</HI> some of them exceeding large, fill'd with water when that abundance of Rain fals (of which more here∣after.)</P>
<P>That most antient and innocent Drink of the World, <HI>Water,</HI> is the common drink of
<PB N="106" REF="69"/>
<HI>East-India;</HI> it is far more pleasant and sweet than our water; and must needs be so, because in all hot Countries it is more rarified▪ better digested, and freed from its rawne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by the heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and therefore in those parts it is more desired of all that come thither, though they ne∣ver made it their drink before, than any other liquor and agreeth better with mens bodies. Sometimes we boyl the water there with some wholsome seeds and after drink it <HI>cold,</HI> and then it is by much more cold after an <HI>heat.</HI> (Like unto some <HI>men,</HI> who have shewed for∣merly much <HI>zeal</HI> and heat for good, and after∣ward become more <HI>chill</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> than ever they were before) Sometimes we mingle our water there with the <HI>juice</HI> of <HI>Limons</HI> and <HI>Sugar,</HI> which makes an exceeding pleasant drink, which we call there <HI>Sherbet.</HI></P>
<P>Some small quantity of <HI>Wine,</HI> but not com∣mon, is made amongst them; they call it <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> distilled from Sugar, and a spicy rinde of a Tree called <HI>Jagra;</HI> it is very wholsome, if taken very moderately.</P>
<P>Many of the people there, who are strict in their Religion, drink no Wine at all; but they use a Liquor more wholsome than pleasant, they call <HI>Coffee,</HI> made by a black seed boyled in water, which turns it almost into the same colour, but doth very little alter the tast of the water; notwithstanding it is very good to
<PB N="107" REF="69"/>
help <HI>digestion,</HI> to quicken the <HI>spirits,</HI> and to cleanse the <HI>blood.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet another help for those that for∣bear Wine, by an Herb they have, called <HI>Beetle,</HI> or <HI>Paune,</HI> in shape somewhat like an Ivy-leaf, but more tender; they chew it with an hard <HI>Nut,</HI> somewhat like a <HI>Nutmeg</HI> (but not in tast like that) and a very little pure <HI>white-lime</HI> amongst the leaves, and when they have sucked down the juice, put forth the rest. It hath (as they say and I believe very much of it) many rare qualities, for it preserves the <HI>Teeth,</HI> strengthens the <HI>Stomack,</HI> comforts the <HI>Brain,</HI> and it cures or prevents a tainted <HI>Breath.</HI> This I am sure of that such is the pleasing smell of this <HI>Beetle,</HI> being chewed in a close <HI>room,</HI> that the breath of him so chewing it fils it with a very pleasing <HI>savour.</HI></P>
<P>This Empire further affords very excellent good <HI>Horse,</HI> curiously <HI>made,</HI> high <HI>mettled,</HI> and well <HI>managed</HI> by the <HI>Natives.</HI> Besides their own, they have many of the <HI>Persian, Tartarian,</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> breed, which have the name to be the choyce ones of the World. But of these more when I come to speak of the <HI>In∣habitants.</HI></P>
<P>Here are a great number of <HI>Camels, Dro∣medaries, Mules</HI> and <HI>Asses,</HI> imployed for the carriage of burthens, or the carrying of the people, to which use also they employ many
<PB N="108" REF="70"/>
of their <HI>Oxen,</HI> and their <HI>Buffeloes</HI> likewise. (which before I spake of) The <HI>Camels,</HI> as I oft observed there, have one strange <HI>quality,</HI> who <HI>cry</HI> and make a very piteous noyse at <HI>night,</HI> when they take off their <HI>burthens;</HI> but in the <HI>morning,</HI> when they are <HI>laid on,</HI> the poor Creatures are very still and quiet, making no <HI>noyse</HI> at all. Many wicked men, who are most fitly called by the Psalmist, <HI>the Beasts of the people,</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. 68. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. (for so it is in the Vulgar Translation, <HI>Beast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for want of Reason, and for not using Reason well, worse than <HI>Brutes)</HI> may be most fitly resembled by those dull <HI>Camels,</HI> who being burthen'd and clogg'd with a great <HI>load</HI> of sin already, enough to press them down into that <HI>bottomless pit,</HI> seem to feel nothing, nor to complain at all, but with much quiet and content keep on their burthens▪ and take up, more still; as if that wickedness, which the Prophet <HI>Zachary, 5. 7. compares to a Talent of Lead,</HI> were as light as a <HI>Feather.</HI> But when we go about by our <HI>Exhortations, Intreaties, Perswasions</HI> of them, and by the strongest Ar∣guments besides we can invent, press them <HI>to suffer God through Christ Jesus to save their souls,</HI> and consequently to get themselves freed from that most intollerable burthen, which will unavoydably sink them into Hell at last, if they be not freed from it; then these, like those stu∣pid Creatures, cry and complain, and seem to
<PB N="109" REF="70"/>
be much disquieted, as if we did them much wrong, while we labour to do them the great∣est right. The reason is, because <HI>their Pride</HI> (as every beloved sin besides) <HI>compasseth them as a Chain,</HI> Psal. 73. 6. it is their <HI>Jewel,</HI> their <HI>Ornament</HI> (as they think) and therefore they will keep it, they will not part from it, though it be their greatest <HI>shame,</HI> because they esteem it their chiefest <HI>Glory.</HI> I would intreat my <HI>Reader,</HI> when he comes to this digression, to read it over and over again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dromedary</HI> is called by the Prophet <HI>Je∣remy, 2. 23. the swift Dromedary;</HI> the reason may be, because these, like the <HI>Camels,</HI> have very long legs, and consequently make long steps, and so travelling rid ground apace; or because at a pinch, or time of need, they will carry a man exceeding far without rest, and but with a very little food.</P>
<P>They have some <HI>Rhynocerots,</HI> but they are not common, which are very large square Beasts, bigger than the largest Oxen <HI>England</HI> affords; their <HI>skins,</HI> without <HI>hair,</HI> lye in great wrinkles upon their <HI>necks, breasts</HI> and <HI>backs,</HI> which doth not make them seem lovely unto the beholders. They have very strong, but short Horns, grow∣ing upon very firm bones, that lye over their Nostrils; they grow upwards, towards the top of their head, every one of these Creatures be∣ing fortified with one of them, and that enough
<PB N="110" REF="71"/>
to make them so terrible, that they are shunn'd by other, though very large Creatures. With these Horns (from which those Creatures have their Names) are made very excellent <HI>Cups,</HI> which (as is conceived) give some virtue unto the liquor put into them, if it stand any whit long in those <HI>Cups.</HI></P>
<P>And now to conclude with the largest and the most intelligent (as we shall hereafter shew) of all the sensible Creatures the Earth produceth, the <HI>Elephant,</HI> of which this vast Monarchy hath abundance; and of them, the <HI>Mogol</HI> is Master of many thousands; and his Nobles, and all men of quality besides, in those large Territo∣ries, have more or less of them. But of these much shall be spoken in my sixt Section.</P>
<P>I observed before, that the Inhabitants of this <HI>Empire</HI> did carry most of their burthens upon the backs of their Beasts, and in a special manner this people employ their <HI>Camels</HI> and <HI>Dromedaries</HI> for this use, to carry their Mer∣chandizes from place to place, and therefore I shall let my Reader see</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>What the chief Merchandizes, and most Staple, and other Commodities are, which are brought into this Empire.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE most Staple Commodities of this Empire are <HI>Indico</HI> and <HI>Cotten-Wool;</HI> of that <HI>Wool</HI> they make divers sorts of <HI>Callico,</HI> which had that name (as I suppose) from <HI>Calli∣cute,</HI> not far from <HI>Goa,</HI> where that kind of Cloth was first bought by the Portugals.</P>
<P>For the Spices brought hither by the <HI>East-India</HI> Fleet they are had more Southerly; from the Islands of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> from <HI>Java major</HI> and <HI>minor,</HI> from the <HI>Moluccoes,</HI> and from other places thereabout: In which, as in the <HI>Molucco</HI> Islands, and those other parts too from whence the richest Spices come, the Low-Countrey Merchants have got such footing, and such a particular interest, that our English Factors there (for the present) buy those Commodities, as we sometimes do buy Provisions and Com∣modities here at home, out of the engrossing <HI>Hucksters hands:</HI> So that our English in those parts have a free Trade for no kind of Spice, but for that, which is one of the lowest prized, namely <HI>Pepper,</HI> which they fetch from <HI>Bant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> Which more general Trade of the Dutch, they have
<PB N="112" REF="72"/>
formerly gained, at a very vast expence, by for∣tifying them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ves there, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the places where∣ever they settle; and then standing upon their <HI>Guard,</HI> put a kind of force upon the <HI>Natives</HI> to fell them their <HI>Commodities.</HI></P>
<P>What the carriage of that people hath for∣merly been in those parts towards our English, <HI>(where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Sword hath been longest)</HI> is suffici∣ently made known by other Pens: This I may conclude from their example (and I would that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ingular and alone in it) that when a people will not be ordered by that <HI>Royal Law,</HI> which commands us, <HI>Mat. 7. 12. to do nothing, but what we would be content to suffer: as to do nothing unto other's, but what we would be well content to suffer from others:</HI> But on the contrary when they measure things, not by the <HI>strait</HI> and <HI>even Rule</HI> of <HI>Equity,</HI> but by the <HI>crooked</HI> and <HI>oblique Line</HI> of <HI>Power▪</HI> arming their In justice to do what they <HI>please,</HI> because they can do what they will; This causeth many to make very <HI>bold with God</HI> in cases that seem to give advantage unto their high Thoughts and Com∣modities: for what evil cannot <HI>Ambition</HI> and <HI>Covetousness</HI> do, when they are back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with an <HI>arbitrary</HI> and <HI>unlimited power</HI> here <HI>below,</HI> if they be not <HI>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> by a stronger <HI>Arm</HI> from <HI>above?</HI> Whence we se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it often come to pass, that when the Laws of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Nations,</HI> yea of <HI>God himself,</HI> lye in the way of their profit,
<PB N="113" REF="72"/>
or earthly advantages (whatever their sufferings or loss be afterward) they either <HI>spurn</HI> them thence, or else <HI>tread</HI> and <HI>trample</HI> upon them at pleasure, to compass their ends for the present. This I can say of the Dutch (something from my own knowledge, but more from the report of others) that when I lived in those parts, and we English there were more for number than they, and consequently could receive no hurt from them, we there used them as Neighbours and Brethren; but in other places, where they had the like advantage of us, they dealt with us neither like Christians, nor Men. But I will not here any longer digress, but return to speak further of the <HI>Commodities</HI> to be had in <HI>East-India.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indico</HI> we bring thence, is a good, and a rich Commodity. It is there made of little <HI>leaves,</HI> not bigger than those on our <HI>Gooseberry bushes,</HI> and the <HI>shrubs</HI> that bear those leaves are about their <HI>bigness.</HI> These leaves they slip off from the small branches of those bushes, which grow with round and full heads without pricks. The leaves thus stripp'd off, are laid in great heaps together certain daies, till they have been in a hot sweat; then are they removed, and put into very great and deep Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sels fill'd with a sufficient quantity of water to sleep them in, where they leave their blew <HI>tincture,</HI> with their <HI>substance!</HI> this done, the water is drain'd out
<PB N="114" REF="73"/>
into other exceeding broad, but very shallow <HI>Vessels▪</HI> or <HI>Vats,</HI> made of <HI>Plaister</HI> (like to that we call Plaister of <HI>Paris)</HI> which will keep in all the Liquor till the hot Sun in short time ex∣tracts the moysture from it; and then what re∣mains in the bottom, is a <HI>Cream</HI> about one quarter of an inch thick, which suddenly be∣comes hard, and dry, and that is our <HI>Indico;</HI> the best sort whereof comes from <HI>Biana,</HI> near unto <HI>Agra,</HI> and a coarser sort is made at <HI>Cir∣keese,</HI> not far from <HI>Amadanaz;</HI> about which two places are a very great number of those <HI>shrubs</HI> planted which bear those <HI>leaves.</HI></P>
<P>For their <HI>Cotton-wool,</HI> they sow seed, and very large quantities of Ground in <HI>East-India</HI> are thus seeded. It grows up like small <HI>Rose-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes;</HI> and then puts forth many <HI>yellow blossoms;</HI> those afterward falling off, there remain little <HI>Gods,</HI> about the bigness of a Man's <HI>thumb,</HI> in which the substance at first is <HI>moyst,</HI> and <HI>yellow;</HI> but as they ripen, they swell bigger, till they break their Covering, and after, in short time, that within them becomes <HI>Wool,</HI> as white as <HI>Snow,</HI> and then they gather it. Amongst that <HI>Wool</HI> they find <HI>seeds</HI> to sow again as they have occasion; but those <HI>shrubs</HI> bear that <HI>Wool</HI> three or four years e're they supplant them. Of this <HI>Cotton-wool</HI> they make divers sorts of white <HI>Cloth</HI> (as before I observed) some <HI>broad,</HI> some <HI>narrow,</HI> some <HI>coarse,</HI> some <HI>sine,</HI> and very fine indeed,
<PB N="115" REF="73"/>
for some that I have seen there I believe was as fine as our purest <HI>Lawn.</HI> Much of the coarser sort of that <HI>Cloth</HI> they dye into <HI>Colours,</HI> or else stain in it variety of well-shaped and well∣coloured <HI>Flowers</HI> or <HI>Figures,</HI> which are so fixed in the Cloth, that no water can wash them out. That pretty art of <HI>staining,</HI> or printing and fix∣ing those variety of Colours in that white Cloth, the People of <HI>Asia</HI> have engrossed to themselves, where the most curious <HI>Pint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>daes</HI> are made; whither neighbouring, as well as more remote Nations, bring their Monies to fetch them thence.</P>
<P>In <HI>Decan,</HI> which bounds upon the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Territories South (the Princes whereof are Tri∣butaries unto him) there are many <HI>Diamond Rocks,</HI> in which are found those most pretious of all other Stones; and they are to be sold in this Empire; and consequently to be had by those who have skill to buy them and Money to pay for them. But as all the Stones in <HI>East-India</HI> are not <HI>pretious▪</HI> so those that are, the Natives know very well how to <HI>value.</HI></P>
<P>But further, for the <HI>Merchandizing Com∣modities</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Provinces afford, there is Musk (by reason of their abundance of Musk-Cats) to be had in good quantity; and there are Bezar-stones, which are not so called from any Beast of that name, but they grow in the <HI>maws</HI> of <HI>Goats,</HI> which when they observe to

<P>The <HI>Scorpions</HI> are in shape like unto our <HI>Cra∣fishes,</HI> and not bigger, and look <HI>black</HI> like them, before they are boyled: they have a little round <HI>tayl</HI> which turns up, and lyes usually upon their <HI>backs,</HI> at the end whereof is their <HI>sting,</HI> which they do not <HI>put</HI> in, and <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> out of their bodyes, as other venemous creatures <HI>doe,</HI> but it alwayes appeares in their <HI>tayles</HI> ready to <HI>strake;</HI> it is very <HI>sharp,</HI> and hard, and not long, but <HI>crooked</HI> like the <HI>talon</HI> of an <HI>Hawk.</HI></P>
<P>The aboundance of Flyes <HI>(like those swarmes in Egypt Ex.</HI> 8. 21.) in those parts did likewise very much annoy us, for in the heat of the day their numberless number was such, as that we could not be quiet in any place for them, they beeing ready to fly into our <HI>cupps,</HI> and to cover our <HI>meat</HI> assoon as it was placed on the <HI>table,</HI> and therefore we had alwayes some of the <HI>Na∣tives</HI> we kept there, who were our servants, to stand round about us on purpose while we were eating, with <HI>Napkins</HI> to fright them <HI>away.</HI> And as in the day one kinde of ordinary <HI>flyes</HI> troubled us; so in the night we were likewise very much disquieted with another sort called <HI>Musqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etoes,</HI> like our <HI>Gnatts,</HI> but somewhat less, and in that
<PB N="124" REF="78"/>
season we were very much troubled with <HI>Chin∣ches,</HI> another sort of little troublesome and of∣fensive creatures, like little <HI>Tikes,</HI> and these an∣noyed us two wayes, as first by their <HI>biting,</HI> and <HI>stinging,</HI> and then by their <HI>stink.</HI> From all which we were by far more free when we lodged in <HI>tents</HI> (as there we did much) than when we a∣bode in <HI>houses;</HI> where in great <HI>cities</HI> and <HI>towns,</HI> (to adde unto the disquiets I before named) there were such an aboundance of large hungry <HI>Ratts,</HI> that some of us were bitten in the night as we lay in our bedds, either on our <HI>toes</HI> or <HI>fin∣gers,</HI> or on the <HI>tipps</HI> of our <HI>eares,</HI> or on the <HI>tops</HI> of our <HI>noses,</HI> or in any part of our bodies besides they could get into their <HI>mouths.</HI></P>
<P>The winds in those parts (as I observed be∣fore) which they call the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t soone,</HI> blow con∣stantly one way, altering but few points, six months <HI>Southerly,</HI> and six months <HI>Northerly.</HI> The months of <HI>April, May,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> till the rain falls, are so extremely <HI>hot,</HI> as that the winde when it blowes but gently, re∣ceives such <HI>heat</HI> from the parched <HI>ground,</HI> that the <HI>reflection</HI> thereof is ready to <HI>blister</HI> a mans face that receives the <HI>breath</HI> of it, And if God did not provide for those parts, by sending a <HI>breeze</HI> or breath, or small gale of <HI>winde</HI> daily, which somewhat tempers that hot sulphureous <HI>air</HI> there were no living in that Torrid Zone for us English, who have been used to breath in a tē∣perate

climate; and notwithstanding that bene∣fit, the air in that place is so hot to us English, that we should be every day <HI>stewed</HI> in our own <HI>moisture,</HI> but that we <HI>stirre</HI> very little in the <HI>heat</HI> of the day, and have cloathing about us as thin as we can make it. And no marvail, for the coldest <HI>day</HI> in the whole year at <HI>noon</HI> (un∣less it be in the time when those raines fall) is <HI>hot∣ter</HI> there than the hottest day in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I have there observed most strange and suddaine <HI>changes</HI> of <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> within few houres, as in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December</HI> the most temperate months of their year (as before) and then at midnight the air was so exceeding fresh and cold, that it would produce a thin Ice on the water, and then as we lay in our Tents, we would have been very glad of the warmth of a <HI>Rugg</HI> upon us, and the <HI>Noon</HI> of that following day would be so extreme <HI>hot,</HI> as that it was troublesome then to keep on the <HI>thinnest cloath∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes there, the winde blowes very high in those <HI>hot</HI> and <HI>dry</HI> seasons, not long before the rain begins to fall raising up into the air a ve∣ry great height, thick clouds of <HI>Dust</HI> and <HI>Sand,</HI> which appear like dark clouds full of <HI>moy∣sture,</HI> but they deceive <HI>like the bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k in Job 6. 15. that hath no water in it.</HI> These <HI>dry showers</HI> (which Almighty God threatens to send among a people as an heavy judgment, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 34.

<P>But there is no <HI>place</HI> nor <HI>Countrey</HI> under Hea∣ven, nor yet ever hath been, without some <HI>dis∣commodities. The Garden of Eden had a Serpent in it,</HI> Gen. 3.

<P>And so having observed what is truth, and what is enough to be said of the <HI>inconveniences</HI> and <HI>annoyances,</HI> as well as of the <HI>commodities</HI> and <HI>contentments</HI> which are to be found in those parts, I come now to speak of the <HI>people</HI> that in∣habit there.

<P>THe Inhabitants in generall of <HI>Indostan</HI> were all antiently <HI>Gentiles,</HI> called in generall <HI>Hin∣does,</HI> belonging to that very great <HI>number</HI> of those which are called <HI>Heathens,</HI> which take up al∣most two thirds of the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>people</HI> who Inhabit the face of the whole earth: But of this

more hereafter. There are some <HI>Jewes</HI> (but they are not many) here and there scattered and lost as it were, in those other great numbers of peo∣ple; the greatest company of <HI>Jewes</HI> now to be found together in any one place of the world (as I have been made to believe from the observa∣tion of others) are to be seen at <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> whither they are returned, and where setled, to take their fill of their <HI>fore-fathers Flesh-pots.</HI> For the Inhabitants of <HI>East-India,</HI> ever since they were subdued by <HI>Tamberlain,</HI> they have been mixed with <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> which though they be by far in respect of their number less than those <HI>Pagans,</HI> yet they bear all the sway, and command all in those Countreys.</P>
<P>There are besides these, (now become as it were natives there) a great number of <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> (who are <HI>Mahumetans</HI> by Reli∣gion) that there inhabit, very many of which the <HI>Mogol</HI> keeps for Souldiers to serve on hors-back called there <HI>Haddees:</HI> There are of both these many daring, stout, hardy and valiant men. For the <HI>Persians</HI> there are of them many comely persons, not so swart as those of <HI>East-India.</HI> But for the <HI>Tartars</HI> I have there seen, (and I have seen many of them) they are more to be commended for their <HI>valour</HI> than <HI>beauty,</HI> a <HI>square, stout, strong people, having pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter faces, and flat Noses.</HI> There are many <HI>Armentans</HI> and some <HI>Abissins</HI> amongst them, who wear the

<HI>Livery</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> in being called Christians, the greatest part of whose <HI>Christianity</HI> lyes in their <HI>Name.</HI> Those <HI>Armenians</HI> there make some <HI>wine</HI> to sell, of Reysons, Sugar, and other ingredients, that is <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>heady,</HI> and <HI>luscious, tasted</HI> too much by many <HI>Christians</HI> that Come thither, as by <HI>those too</HI> that make it. Of the green <HI>grapes</HI> there, though they have abundance and they great, and sweet, and good, yet they make no <HI>wine</HI> at all: The <HI>Mahumetans</HI> (in obedience to a precept of <HI>Mahumets</HI> which forbids <HI>wine)</HI> nei∣ther <HI>make,</HI> nor <HI>drink</HI> it, and others are not suf∣fered there to make it of those green <HI>grapes,</HI> for fear (as I suppose) they should <HI>make,</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> too <HI>much</HI> of it.</P>
<P>To those I have named of other nations, (that are to be seen in <HI>East-India)</HI> there are be∣sides some few almost of every people in <HI>Asia,</HI> and many <HI>Europeans</HI> of divers parts (that use to <HI>stirre</HI> from their own <HI>fires)</HI> to be found amongst them; and among that great variety of <HI>people</HI> and <HI>nations</HI> there to be observed, I have taken speciall notice of divers <HI>Chinesaas,</HI> and <HI>Japane∣saas</HI> there, and those I have seen of them for the generality, are a people of no large stature, with little eyes, and noses something flatted, <HI>de tribus Capillis,</HI> with a few black hayres that stand scattered on their upper lipps, which make them as handsome beards as are to be seen on our <HI>Hares,</HI> or <HI>Catts.</HI></P>

<P>How usuall is that <HI>Proverb,</HI> that when men are suspected to do otherwise than they should, to answer, what, <HI>am I Jew, that I should do so, and so?</HI> I have observed something to this pur∣pose, from the people of <HI>East-India,</HI> who are very valiant at <HI>tongue-fights,</HI> though not so with their weapons (as you will hear after∣ward) that people I say, who have a very <HI>nimble</HI> but a <HI>base quality</HI> in <HI>rayling</HI> at, and <HI>miscalling</HI> one another, and their language is so full, and significant, that they can call a man in it, two or three base things in one word; But when they come to call him, whom they miscall, <HI>Judeo</HI> Jew, they believe (as I have been often told) that they can goe no higher, esteeming that, above all o∣ther tearms, the heighest <HI>name</HI> of <HI>obloqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Yet we do believe, (because the Lord hath promised it) that he will finde a time to call home this people again to himself, when they shall receive honour above all the contempt they have been long under, after they shall see with sorrow, and with the eye of <HI>faith, Him,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their <HI>Forefathers,</HI> out of ignorance, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and unbelief <HI>Pierced.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="82"/>
For the <HI>stature</HI> of the Natives of <HI>East-India</HI> they are like us, but generally very <HI>streight,</HI> for I never observed, nor heard of, any <HI>crooked</HI> per∣son amongst them. And one reason may be, be∣cause they never <HI>lace</HI> nor <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt</HI> in their <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dyes,</HI> and when they <HI>sleep,</HI> they accustome themselves to stretch out their bodyes at their full length with∣out any thing to raise up their heads. And fur∣ther amongst many other things I take speciall notice of there, I never observed any <HI>deformed person,</HI> nor <HI>Idiot,</HI> or naturall <HI>fool</HI> in those <HI>parts.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the cōplexion of this people, they are all of them of a <HI>sad tawney</HI> or <HI>Olive colour,</HI> their <HI>hair</HI> black as a <HI>Raven,</HI> very harsh, but not <HI>curl'd.</HI> They like not a man or woman that is very white or fair, because that (as they say) is the colour of <HI>Lepers</HI> common amongst them. Most of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> except the <HI>Moola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> (which are their Priests) or those which are very <HI>old</HI> and <HI>re∣tyred,</HI> and have (as it were) given the <HI>world</HI> quite <HI>over,</HI> keep their <HI>chinns</HI> continually <HI>bare,</HI> but suffer the hair on their upper <HI>lipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to grow very <HI>long;</HI> and they keep it in its naturall colour by combing it continually with <HI>black-lead combes,</HI> till they be of good yeares; but afterward, when time hath so <HI>snowed</HI> upon them, that they can no longer keep in nor conceal their <HI>gray haires,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> use the <HI>Rasor</HI> (as they did) no more but let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of their <HI>chins</HI> to grow <HI>long</HI> and <HI>large,</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="82"/>
which makes many <HI>gray-beards</HI> amongst them, and I conceive that there are of those, many <HI>old men.</HI></P>
<P>And further it is the manner of the <HI>Mahu∣metans</HI> to <HI>shav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> all the hair from off their heads, reserving only one <HI>lock</HI> on the <HI>crown</HI> of them for <HI>Mahume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to pull them up to heaven (as they fondly conceit). The <HI>Hindooes</HI> shave their heads likewise, but cut all off, and both of them, shave thus and that very often, but however their <HI>bald∣nes</HI> appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res not at all, because their <HI>Heads</HI> are continually covered with a <HI>shash,</HI> or a wreath of narrow▪ <HI>Callico-cloth</HI> many times wrapt about them (usually for the colour <HI>white,</HI> or <HI>red)</HI> which they never pull off as we doe our <HI>hatts</HI> in com∣plements. Their much and often <HI>shaving</HI> makes many excellent <HI>Barbers</HI> amongst them, who be∣sides their <HI>Sizers</HI> and <HI>Rasors</HI> use a little instru∣ment about the length of a short <HI>bodkin,</HI> very sharp, made like a <HI>chizell,</HI> but not broader at the cutting end than the <HI>shank</HI> of a six-penny <HI>nayl,</HI> with which they <HI>pare</HI> and <HI>cleanse</HI> the nayles on their fingers, and toes. Every Barber carryes al∣wayes about him, a round <HI>looking-glass</HI> made of <HI>steel,</HI> about the compass of a large <HI>tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncher∣plate,</HI> made somewhat hollow, and kept by them exceeding <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>sleek,</HI> so that it will represent the face of him that beholds it on the convex side very well. These <HI>Babers,</HI> as they walk up and down, often present these glasses un∣to
<PB N="134" REF="83"/>
men whom they finde sitting still, which is a tender of their service if they shall please to make use of them.</P>
<P>The people there often wash their <HI>bodyes,</HI> and keep their <HI>feet</HI> as clean and as sweet as their <HI>hands.</HI> The better sort annoint themselves very much with sweet <HI>oyles,</HI> which makes their com∣pany (as before I observed) very <HI>savoury.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Natives</HI> there (of which there is some∣thing before in my third <HI>Section)</HI> shew very much ingenuity in their <HI>curious manifactures;</HI> as in their <HI>silk stuffs</HI> which they most artificially weave, some of them very nearly mingled either with <HI>silver</HI> or <HI>gold,</HI> or both. As also in making excellent <HI>quilts</HI> of their <HI>stayned cloth,</HI> or of fresh coloured <HI>Taffata</HI> lined with their <HI>Pintado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> or of their <HI>satten</HI> lined with <HI>Taffata,</HI> betwixt which they put <HI>Cotton wooll,</HI> and work them together with silk. Those <HI>Taffata</HI> or <HI>Satten</HI> quilts, are ex∣cellently <HI>stitched</HI> by them, being done as <HI>evenly,</HI> and in as good <HI>order,</HI> as if they had been <HI>drawn</HI> out to them, for their <HI>direction,</HI> the better to work them. They make likewise excellent <HI>car∣petts</HI> of their <HI>Cotten-wool,</HI> in fine <HI>mingled</HI> colours, some of them more than three yards broad, and of a great lenghth. Some other Richer Carpets they make all of Silk, so artificially mixed, as that they lively represent those flowers, &amp; figures made in them. The ground of some other o their very Rich Carpets is Silver or Gold, abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="135" REF="83"/>
which are such <HI>silken</HI> flowers, and Figures (as before I named) most excellently and orderly disposed throughout the whole worke.</P>
<P>Their skill is likewise exquisite in making of <HI>Cabinetts,</HI> or <HI>Boxes,</HI> or <HI>Trunks,</HI> or <HI>standishes,</HI> curiously wrought, within, and without; inlaid with <HI>Elephants tooth,</HI> or <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Pearl,</HI> or <HI>Ebony,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortoyse shell,</HI> or <HI>wire;</HI> they make ex∣cellent Cupps, and others things of <HI>Agate,</HI> and <HI>Cornelian,</HI> and curious they are in cutting all manner of stones <HI>Diamonds</HI> as well as others.</P>
<P>They paint staves, or bedsteads or cheasts of Boxes, or Fruit dishes, or large Chargers, extreme neatly, which, when they be not inlayd (as be∣fore) they cover the wood (first being handsomely turnd) with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hick Gumme, then put their Paint on, most artificially made of liquid silver, or gold, or other lively colours, which they use, and after make it much more beautifull with a very cleer varnish put upon it.</P>
<P>They are excellent at Limning, and will cop∣pie out any picture they see to the life: for confir∣mation of which, take this instance; It happened that my <HI>Lord Ambassadour</HI> visiting the <HI>Mogol</HI> on a time, as he did often, He presented him with a curious neat small oval Picture done to the life in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Mogol</HI> was much plea∣sed with it; but told the <HI>Ambassadour</HI> withall, that happily he supposed that there was never a one in his Countrey that could do so well in that
<PB N="136" REF="84"/>
curious Art, and then offered to wager with him a <HI>Leck</HI> of <HI>Roopies</HI> (a sum which amounted to no less then 10000 l. sterl.) that in a few dayes he would have two Coppies made by that presented to him, so like, that the <HI>Ambassadour</HI> should not know his own. He refused the great Wager, but told the King he would adventure his judgmēt on it: Two Coppies taken from that Originall were within few dayes after made, and brought &amp; laid before the Ambassadour, in the presence of the King; the Ambassadour viewing them long, ei∣ther out of Courtship to please the King, or else unable to make a difference 'twixt the pictures being all exquisitly done, took one of them which was new made, for that which he had formerly presented, and did after Profess that he did not flatter, but mistake in that choise. The truth is, that the <HI>Natives</HI> of that <HI>Monarchy</HI> are the best Apes for imitation in the world, so full of inge∣nuity that they will make any new thing by pat∣tern, how hard soever it seem to be done, and therefore it is no marvell, if the <HI>Natives</HI> there make Shooes, and Boots, and Clothes, and Lin∣nen, and Bands and Cuffs of our <HI>English Fashion,</HI> which are all of them very much different from their fashions and habits, and yet make them all exceeding neatly.</P>
<P>They have Markets, which they call <HI>Bazars,</HI> to sell and buy their commodities, in all their great Towns twice every day, a little before, and
<PB N="137" REF="84"/>
an hour after Sun rising in the morning, and so a little before and a little after Sun-set at night. The other parts of the day being too hot for those great confluences of people to meet toge∣ther; and those are the seasons we <HI>English-men</HI> there make use of, to ride abroad and take the air, the rest of the day we usually spend in our houses. The people there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell almost all their provisions, as very many other things, by weight.</P>
<P>For the forein Trade of this people, it is usu∣ally once a year into the <HI>Red Sea</HI> to a City cal∣led <HI>Moha</HI> in <HI>Arabia</HI> the <HI>happy,</HI> about thirty leagues from the mouth of it; It is a principall <HI>Mart</HI> for all <HI>Indian</HI> commodities, but the <HI>staple</HI> and most principall there vented is their <HI>Cotten-cloth,</HI> either white, or steyned, and their <HI>Cotten-wooll.</HI> Hither they come from <HI>grand Cai∣ro</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as from many other parts of the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions to <HI>trafique;</HI> Hither they come from <HI>Prester Johns</HI> Countrey which lyes on the other side of the <HI>Arabian Golfe</HI> (for so the <HI>Red Sea</HI> is there called) and not above fourteen leagues over at the City <HI>Moha.</HI></P>
<P>The Ship or <HI>Junk</HI> (for so it is called) that usually goes from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Moha</HI> is of an excee∣ding great burden, some of them I believe four∣teen or fifteen hundred Tunns, or more, but those huge vessels are bery ill built, like an over-grown Liter, broad and short, but made exceed∣ing big, on purpose to waff passengers forward

and backward: which are <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who goe on purpose to visit <HI>Mahomets</HI> sepulcher, at <HI>Medina</HI> neer <HI>Mecha,</HI> but many miles beyond <HI>Moha.</HI> The passengers, and others in that most capacious vessell that went and returned that year I left <HI>India,</HI> (as we were credibly told) amounted to the number of seventeen hundred. Those <HI>Mahumetans</HI> that have visited <HI>Mahu∣mets</HI> Sepulcher, are ever after called <HI>Hoggees,</HI> or holy men.</P>
<P>This <HI>Junk</HI> bound from <HI>Surat</HI> to the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> as she hath many people in her, so hath she good Ordnance, but those Navigators know not well how to use them for their defence. She begins her voyage about the twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> and finisheth it, about the end of <HI>September</HI> fol∣lowing. The voyage is but short, and might easi∣ly be made in less than three moneths, but the ship is very slow, and ill-built to abide foul wea∣ther, and in the long season of the rain, and a little before and after it, the winds upon those coasts are commonly so violent that there is no comming but with much hazard into the <HI>In∣dian Sea.</HI> This Ship returning is usually worth (as I have heard it faithfully reported and if my credit given to that report make me not to abuse my Readers two hundred thousand pounds ster∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>g, and most of it brought back in good Gold and Silver; some fine <HI>Chamlets</HI> they bring with them home likewise, but that huge mass of

<HEAD>SECTION VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the care and skill of this people in keep∣ing and managing their excellent good Horses. Of their Elephants and their ordering and managing them. And how the people ride and are carried up and down from place to place.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Souldery here, and so many of the Gen∣try, and better sort of the people, who live at Court, shew excellent good skill in riding and managing of their well turn'd, high metald, choise horses, which are excellent good at moun∣ting up, bounding and curvetting, and when they runne them at their full swiftest speed will stop them at a foots breadth; for the scantling of those creatures, they are in proportion like ours, but excellently well eyed, headed, limn'd; for their colours there are some of them Raven black, but many more of them white, curiously dap∣led; and a very great number Pied and spotted
<PB N="140" REF="86"/>
all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and there are some of other bright co∣lours. But it is a usual custom there amongst <HI>Gal∣lants</HI> who ride upon the bright coloured horses, to have their leggs &amp; lower parts of their <HI>Bellyes</HI> and <HI>Brests</HI> died into a <HI>Saffron</HI> colour (of which they have much there) which makes them look as if they had stood in some <HI>Dyars vate,</HI> just up to such an <HI>height</HI> of their <HI>bodyes.</HI></P>
<P>The hair upon their Horses (whom they keep plump and fat) is very short, soft, and lyes sleek upon them, and I wonder not at it, they are kept so daintily, every Horse being allowed a man to dress and feed him, and to run by him when he is rode forth, and this is all his work.</P>
<P>They tye not down their horse heads when they stand still (as we do) with hal ets, but se∣cure each horse by two ropes, fastned to their hinde feet, which ropes are somwhat long to be staked down behind them in tents, or other places wherein they are kept.</P>
<P>They cut grass for them green or withered on the earth as they have occasion to use it, never mowing their ground and making hay as we do. But that which keeps their Horses in heart, and in flesh, is the provender they eat which is a kinde of round grain they call <HI>Donna,</HI> somewhat big∣ger than our Tares, which they give not unto them drye but boyl'd. and mingled with some corse sugar amongst it and when it is cold give it them, made up in round Balls, which they put
<PB N="141" REF="86"/>
into their mouths, as if they cramb'd them; and sometimes they put a little Butter into these bals to scour their bodyes.</P>
<P>Their choyse good horses are valued there at as dear if not an higher rate, than those we esteem most of in <HI>England</HI> are prized with us. They make excellent Sadles, and some of them of great value adorned with handsome and rich trapings, all of them very easy both for the horse, and his rider. They manage their horses with strong snafles, whose reigns and head-stalls are made suitable to their Saddles and Trapings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elephants</HI> in this vast Monarchy are very numerous, and though they be the largest, and that by far, of all the Creatures the earth brings forth, yet are they so tractable, unless at some times when the Males are mad (of which more afterward) as that a boy of twelve years old is able to rule the biggest of them, in which we may in a speciall manner read a Comment on that truth which tells us how that the Lord hath put <HI>the fear of man upon all the creatures here below;</HI> even upon the greatest of them, as well as the least. <HI>Thou makest him</HI> saith David Psal. 8▪ 6, 7. <HI>to have domixion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet; all sheep and Oxen, yea and the beasts of the field, &amp;c.</HI> Now if Almighty God should let loose the Crea∣tures upon man, if he should let go those reigns by which they restrained, and suffer the Crea∣tures
<PB N="142" REF="87"/>
to renounce their obedience to man, when man throws off his yoak of obedience to God, what mischief might not those vast overgrown Creatures do in those parts where there are so many of them? nay, What mischief might not any other Creatures do, even the least of them, as the <HI>Locust,</HI> and <HI>Canker-worm,</HI> and <HI>Catterpillar,</HI> &amp;c. which are called <HI>Gods great Army, Joel</HI> 2. 25. If God should give them Commission to put themselves in Battel-aray, and to march forth, to vex and annoy the Nations of the earth?</P>
<P>We may read <HI>Ex.</HI> 8. how that all the Power that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> were able to make, could not guard and defend them from the in∣cursions made upon them, and mischiefs done to them, by Froggs, and Lice, and Flyes. <HI>There are spirits which are Created for vengeance</HI> (saith <HI>Syracidos) &amp;c. as the teeth of wild beasts, and Scorpions, and Serpents, punishing the wicked to destruction, they rejoyce to do Gods Com∣mandement,</HI> &amp;c. If Almighty God should free the Creatures from their subjection, they would be able with their <HI>Horns,</HI> and <HI>Hoofs,</HI> and <HI>Fangs,</HI> and <HI>Teeth,</HI> and <HI>Beaks,</HI> and <HI>Claws,</HI> and <HI>stings,</HI> (which are their natural Artillerie) exceedingly to annoy, if not to destroy man from the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>Elephants</HI> (I have begun to speak of) they are very huge vast overgrown Crea∣tures, some of whem which I have seen, I con∣ceive
<PB N="143" REF="87"/>
at the least twelve foot high, but there are amongst them (as they say) fourteen or fifteen foot in height. The colour of them all is black; their skins thick, and smooth without hair; They have full eyes, but not proportionable to their great bodys, they have eares like our Oxen, but not exceeding large, and those eares edged (as it were) about with a short hair-fringe; and at the end of their tayls (which are slender and not very long) there growes some hair likewise, and a little on their eyelids; but no where els about their bodyes.</P>
<P>The feet of the <HI>Elephants</HI> look like the <HI>trunks</HI> of small trees cut square off from their roots, round about which there are thick, and short, and broad claws growing.</P>
<P>Some that write of them have abused the world with this tradition that they have no joints in their leggs, and therefore stand when they sleep against trees to hold them up, which is all very false, for they ly down and arise again at their pleasure as other beasts do.</P>
<P>Their motion is not swift, a walking rather than a pace, about three miles at the most an hour, but of all heasts that carry burdens, they are most sure of foot, for they never fall, nor yet stumble to endanger their Rider.</P>
<P>They are most docile creatures, and of all those we account meerly sensible come neerest unto reason.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="88"/>
<HI>Lipsius</HI> in his Epistles Cent. 1. Epist. 50. out of his observation from others, writes more of them than I can confirm, or any, I perswade my self, believe; yet many things most remarkable, which seem indeed to be acts of reason rather than sense, I have observed in them, for instance, an <HI>Elephant</HI> will doe any thing his keeper Com∣mands him, as if he bid him to affright a man, he will make towards him as if he meant to tread him into peeces, but when he is come at him do him no hurt at all; so if he would have him, to abuse or to disgrace a man, he will take dirt or dust, or kennel-water into his Trunk, and dash it on his face.</P>
<P>Their Trunks are grisly snouts of a great length, hanging down betwixt their long teeth, which teeth nature hath given them for their de∣fence, otherwise they are of little use to them. In their Trunks they have such marvellous strength, that by them they can do very much mischief, for if they strike an Horse, or Camel, or any other the like beast with them, (as sometimes they do when as they are mad) they will so break their bones, as that they will spoyl, nay kill them at one blow, and much more a man if he chance to come in their way.</P>
<P>Those Trunks of the <HI>Elephants</HI> are to them as an hand by which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed themselves, and make great use of them otherwise upon all occa∣sions, for with those Trunks they tear off bowghs
<PB N="147" REF="88"/>
from trees, by winding them about them, and after, with them, put boughs into their mouths, and eat the tenderest parts of them. With these they pull up green corn (if they be suffered) and grass by the roots, and then against their leggs beat off the earth and dust that hangs a∣bout them, before they eat thereof. Thus they deal with sedgs, or weeds which they find in the water, first washing off the dirt which hangs on the roots thereof, and then down they go in∣to their vast bellyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elephants</HI> delight much to bathe them∣selves in water, in which, when they find depth enough, they swim as well as any other Crea∣tures.</P>
<P>I observed before, that the male <HI>Elephants</HI> when they grow lusty are sometimes mad for their <HI>Femals,</HI> but in few dayes come again in temper; before which time they are so mischie∣vous, that they will strike any thing, but their Keepers, that comes in their way; and their strength is such (as before I observ'd) that there is no blow they give which lights either upon men or beast, but carryes death with it. At those times to prevent mischief they are kept apart from Company, fetterd with strong chaines unto trees; but if by chance in their phrensie they get loose (as sometimes they do) they will make after every thing they see stir, in which case they have no means to stop them
<PB N="148" REF="89"/>
in their violent course, but by firing of <HI>Crackers</HI> made of Gunpowder, whose sparkling, and noyse makes them to stand still and tremble. When those creatures are in that mad distem∣per, they sweat much, which makes their sa∣vour exceeding rank and filthy like that ill smel of a Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he is fatting in his Stye, but by much more strong, and more offensive than that.</P>
<P>An <HI>English Merchant</HI> there, of good credit upon his own knowledge, reported this thing which followes, and is very observable, of an <HI>Elephant</HI> in <HI>Adsmeer,</HI> (the place then of the <HI>Mogols</HI> residence) who being brought often through the <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market place, a woman who usually sat there to sell herbs, was wont to give this great <HI>Elephant</HI> an handfull, as he many times passed by; this <HI>Elephant</HI> after, be∣ing mad, brake his fetters, and took his way through that <HI>Bazar;</HI> the people being all of them much affrighted, made hast to secure themselves by getting out of his way, amongst whom was this herb-woman, who, for fear and hast, forgot her little Child which she had brought thither; the <HI>Elephant</HI> came to the place where this woman usually sate, stopt, and seeing a little Child lying there about her herbs, took it up gently with his <HI>Trunk,</HI> not doing it the least harm, and presently after layd it down upon the stall of an house that was hard by;
<PB N="149" REF="89"/>
and then proceeded on in his furious course. <HI>Acosta,</HI> a Jesuit, relates the like of an <HI>Elephant</HI> in <HI>Goa</HI> from his own experience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elephant,</HI> though he be vast, and terrible, yea and cruell too, when he is set to do mis∣chief, or when he is mad, yet otherwise is a tame gentle Creature, so that the dread of this huge beast, most appears to the eyes. But not∣withstanding his terribleness, I once there saw a <HI>Creature</HI> compared with an <HI>Elephant,</HI> not much bigger than a small <HI>Fish</HI> compared with a <HI>Whale,</HI> boldly to encounter one of them. The occasion by which this so came to pass of∣fers it self thus; that year I went for <HI>East-In∣dia,</HI> the Merchants here (as from the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in whose name they sent all their pre∣sents) amongst many other things, then sent the <HI>Mogol</HI> some great English <HI>Mastives,</HI> and some large Irish <HI>Greyhounds,</HI> in all to the num∣ber of eight, dispersed in our severall ships; one of those high spirited Mastives in our voyage thither, upon a day seeing a great <HI>Shoale</HI> or company of <HI>Porpisces</HI> (before described) moun∣ting up above the waves, and coming toward that ship wherein he was, suddenly lept over-board to encounter with them, before any did take notice of that fierce creature, to prevent that engagement, wherein he was irrecovera∣bly lost, the ship then having such a fresh gale of winde, that she could not suddenly slack her

course, whereby that poor creature might have been preserved. Another, one of the Irish <HI>Grey∣hounds</HI> had his head shot off in our fight. The <HI>Mange</HI> was the destruction of four more of them, only two of the Mastives came alive to <HI>East-India,</HI> and they were carried up, each of them drawn in a little Coach, when I went up to the Embassador, that he might present them to the <HI>Mogol.</HI> The fiercest of these two, in our way thither, upon a time breaking loose, fell upon a very large <HI>Elephant</HI> that was hard by us, fastning his teeth in the <HI>Elephants</HI> Trunk, and kept his hold there a good while, which made that huge beast extremely to roare; and though the <HI>Elephant</HI> did swing the Mastive up and down above ground many times (as not fee∣ling his weight) that he might throw him off; yet he could not suddenly do it, but at last free∣ing himself from the dog by throwing him a good space from him, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e came a Mungrill Curr of that Countrey towards our Mastive, who then lost this his most unequal match, fell upon that dog and kild him, by which means we recovered our Mastive again into our custo∣dy, he having not received any apparent hurts; by which we may see how much Courage and Mettle there is in those right fierce Mastives.</P>
<P>This storie pleased the <HI>Mogol</HI> very much when the dogs were presented to him, and he allowed each of them four attendants of those
<PB N="151" REF="90"/>
Natives to wait upon them, who by turnes two and two together carried them up and down with him in <HI>Palankees,</HI> (after described) to which they were tyed, and the other two went by them, fanning the flyes from off them; and the King caused a pair of silver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongs to be made on purpose, that with them when he pleased, he might feed those dogs with his own hand. But this story by the way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> hath many of his great <HI>Elephants</HI> train'd up for the war, who carry each of them one iron <HI>gun,</HI> about five foot long, lying upon a strong <HI>frame of wood,</HI> made square that is fit∣ted to a thick broad Pannel fastned about him; with very strong and broad Girses or Girts. The <HI>gun</HI> like an <HI>Harquebush</HI> hath a peece of iron like a Musket-rest fastned on the sides thereof, made loose to play up and down. The bottome of that Iron Rest so fixed, is long, to be let through that frame of wood on the foreside, and so to be keyed in at the bottom. At the four corners of this frame are small flags of silk, with sundry devices painted on them, put upon little neat coloured staves; upon the neck of the <HI>Elephant</HI> sits a man to guide him, and within the frame a <HI>Gunner,</HI> to make his shot as he finds occasion. The peece thus mounted, car∣rves a bullet about the bigness of a <HI>Tennis Ball.</HI></P>
<P>Some <HI>Elephants</HI> the King keeps for the exe∣cution
<PB N="152" REF="91"/>
of Malefactors, the manner how, fol¦lowes in <HI>Section</HI> 23. And some he keeps to car∣ry himself, and women; and some <HI>Elephants</HI> are kept for State (of which more when I shall come to speak more particularly of the great <HI>Mogol.)</HI> Other <HI>Elephants</HI> are there imployed for the carrying of burdens▪ their strength be∣ing so great as that they will bear a marvailous weight.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elephants</HI> are all governed with a small <HI>rod</HI> of steel about half a yard long, made sharp on the lower end, and towards that end there is an hook returned, life a fish-hook, that is very sharp likewise, by which their Riders sit∣ting on their necks, pull them back, or prick them forward at their pleasure.</P>
<P>These vast Creatures, though the Countrey be exceeding fruitfull, and all provisions in it cheap, yet by reason of their huge bulk, if they be well kept and fed, are very chargeable in keeping; they are kept usually under the shade of great trees, where by a strong chain of iron upon one of their hinde leggs they fasten them. And as they stand, the abundance of flyes vex them, and therefore with their fore-feet they make dust, (the ground usually being very dry) and with their Trunks cast the dust about their bodyes to drive away those flyes from them.</P>
<P>The King allowes every one of those great male <HI>Elephants</HI> four femals, which in their
<PB N="153" REF="91"/>
language they call their wives. These brutes (as they say) will not endure any to behold them when they are coupling together; which may condemn many who call themselves men and women, but have so lost all modesty, that <HI>they are not ashamed when they commit any act of filthiness, no they are not ashamed, neither can they blush.</HI> The Female <HI>Elephants</HI> (as they fur∣ther say) carry their young, one whole year ere they bring them forth, Thirty years expire ere they come to their full growth, and they fulfill the accustomed age of men ere they dye. And lastly, notwithstanding the great Number there of those vast Creatures, and the excessive charge in keeping them well, they value them at ex∣ceeding high rates.</P>
<P>For this people, when as they journey from place to place, the men of the inferiour sort go all on foot, their women that cannot so tra∣vell, ride on little Oxen, inured to carry bur∣dens, or on Asses, which carry their little chil∣dren with them; the women like the men a∣stride. Others that are of better quality ride on Horses, Mules, Camels, Dromedaries, or else in slights Coaches with two wheeles cove∣red on the top and back end, but the fore-part and sides open, unless they carry women. Those Coaches will carry four persons beside the dri∣ver, but two may lye at ease, and at length in them upon quilts, that ly in the body of them,

upheld by girt-webb, with which they are bot∣tom'd, which makes them by far more easie These Coaches are covered for men of qualityr with some thing that is <HI>costly;</HI> much of ou <HI>English</HI> broad cloth that is dyed red, is there bought from us and imployed for that use. At the back end of this <HI>coach</HI> they have a long round <HI>bolster,</HI> that reacheth both sides, stuffed with Cotten-wool, and covered with <HI>Velvet</HI> or <HI>Sattin,</HI> or with some other thing that is rich. These <HI>Coaches</HI> are drawn by <HI>Oxen,</HI> one yoak to a Coach, some of which <HI>Oxen</HI> have their short hornes neatly <HI>tipped with silver plate,</HI> and some others with <HI>brasse;</HI> and they have each of them a fine Collar of large round <HI>bells,</HI> some of them made of <HI>Silver.</HI> They are <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> &amp; suted as our Coach-horses for stature and colour; most of them thus imployed are white, and some pide, or spotted all over with several colours. They are <HI>guided</HI> with small <HI>cords</HI> which goe through the parting of their <HI>Nostrils,</HI> and so twixt their hornes into the Coach mans hand who by these restrain them when, and guides them how he pleaseth, and when he would have them go on, <HI>pricks</HI> them forward with a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al and short staff he keeps in his hand pointed like a <HI>goad.</HI> These <HI>Oxen</HI> there are very neatly made, <HI>slender, strait limb'd</HI> and not very large, but naturally very <HI>nimble,</HI> and by daily use made so fit to per∣form that labour, (being kept well shod) as
<PB N="155" REF="92"/>
that they go 20 miles a day &amp; more, with good speed. They keep those Oxen for this service, as their horses, well dressed, and so well fed, that they be plump and fat, and consequently very handsom to behold.</P>
<P>The <HI>men</HI> there of the <HI>greatest</HI> rank and <HI>qua∣lity,</HI> ride sometimes in those <HI>Coaches,</HI> and some∣times on their curious <HI>Horses,</HI> and sometimes on their brave <HI>Elephants</HI> but however they are car∣ried, they have their horses which wait upon thē, when they go abroad, that they may bestride them when they please And at other times they ride on mens shoulders, in a slight thing they call a <HI>Palankee,</HI> made somewhat like a <HI>couch</HI> or stan∣ding <HI>Pallat,</HI> covered with a Canopie, wherein a man may lye at his full length, as many of those <HI>Grandees</HI> do, when they are removed from place to place, giving themselves up to ease, and over unto those sins which follow it; and while they are thus carried, they make the shoulders and joints of those that feel their heavy weight, to bow and buckle under their burdens. This as it should seem was an ancient, but a base effemi∣nacy sometimes used in <HI>Rom. Juvenal</HI> in his first Satire, describing a fat <HI>Lawyer</HI> thus carried.</P>

<P>I am no Leveller, I hate the thought of it, as a wild fancy, and phrensie that is most de∣structive; knowing, that there is an absolute ne∣cessity amongst men of superiority and subordi∣nation, where some must command, and o∣thers obey.

Therefore though many which are very poor, who to gain bread are content to submit themselves unto any Low Conditions; yet others (twixt whom and them nothing so much as an inequality of estate makes the maine difference) should not thus imploy them, if not for the mans, yet for his manhood sake; not put such a vast distance, such a maine difference betwixt others and themselves, made of the very selfesame mould, and happily more graciously beheld by that invisible eye than themselves are, before whom they must first or last all appear, and that upon equal tearmes.</P>
<P>But I shall here degress no further; but return again to that people (I mean

those of quality amongst them) who out of <HI>Pride,</HI> or <HI>Idleness,</HI> or <HI>both,</HI> are thus carried up and down, or by some other meanes I named before, though they remove never so little way from one place to another, accounting it very dishonorable for them to go on foot.

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their numerous Armies; Their Am∣muniton for war; How they lade themselves with weapons; How terri∣ribly they appear; yet how pusillani∣mous, and low spirited they are.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHere first, for their numerous Armies, it will appear to be no strange thing, if we consider the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> to be what he is, an overgrown <HI>Prince,</HI> (as before described) in the vast extent of his large territories, being like a huge <HI>Pike</HI> in a great Pond, that preys upon all his neighbours, who therefore pur∣chase, and keep his favour by very great Pre∣sents given him by any of homage, and a sub∣miss acknowledgment of his mighty Power. And besides, the <HI>Mogol</HI> is a master of unknown
<PB N="159" REF="94"/>
treasure, having <HI>Silver</HI> as 'tis written of <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> 1 K. 10. 27. <HI>Like stones in the streets.</HI> And certainly in far greater abundance than ever <HI>Solomon</HI> had. Though I must tell my Rea∣der, that all metals there, are not silver and gold, nor all stones precious. Now he that can command what treasure he will, may likewise command what men he please, as the <HI>Mogol</HI> doth besides his own people. Many <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> (before spoken of) very valiant men, who serve him as Souldiers on horse-back, and so the major part by far; whether Natives, or strangers, are mounted for his service in his wars.</P>
<P>Hence it is that the <HI>Armies</HI> there consist of incredible multitudes; they talk of some which have exceeded that mightie <HI>Host which Zerah King of Ethiopia brought against King Asa,</HI> 2 Chron. 14. 9. but they having not well lear∣ned that horrid bloody <HI>art of war,</HI> as the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> have; and wanting Commanders, and other Officers to manage their great Compa∣nies, are not so <HI>skilfull to destroy▪</HI> as otherwise they might be: it is a phrase most properly and fitly applyed unto savage, and absurd, and bru∣tish, and unreasonable man, to the Enemies of God, and of his Church by the Prophet <HI>Eze∣kiel,</HI> 21. 31. Where Almighty God threatens <HI>that he will deliver them into the hands of bru∣tish men, and skilfull to destroy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="95"/>
The weapons they use in their Wars are Bowes, and Arrowes, Swords, and Bucklers, short Lances, having excellent good steel-heads, &amp; short peeces like unto <HI>Carbines,</HI> besides those carried upon <HI>Elephants</HI> (before described) some footmen in their warrs carry those lesser Guns, with Bowes and Arrowes, Swords and Bucklers, and they are excellent Marks-men. They make good Gun-powder for their own use, and fire their Guns with March, or Touch-wood. Their swords are made crooked like Falchons, and are very sharp, but for want of skill in those that temper them, will easily break, but not bend. And therefore we sell at good rates our English Sword-blades that will bow, and be∣come strait again. They have, (and they say that for many generations past have had) great Ordnance, though they seldom make use of them in their Wars.</P>
<P>Their warlike musick are some Kettle-drums carried on horse-back, with long winde Instru∣ments, which make not Musick, but noyse so harsh, and unpleasing, that it is enough to fright away their enemies.</P>
<P>They say, that in their military engage∣ments, they make at the first very furious on∣sets, which are too violent long to continue, for the Scale quickly decides the Controversy, when that side which happens first to be worsted, and to be put into disorder, knowes better to Run than to Rally again.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="95"/>
There are some of the <HI>Mogols</HI> own subjects which are men of courage; those of note among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are called <HI>Baloches,</HI> inhabi∣ting <HI>Haiacan,</HI> adjoyning unto the Kingdom of <HI>Persia,</HI> (spoken of before) and there are others called <HI>Patans,</HI> taking their denomination from a Province of that name in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala.</HI> These will look an enemy boldly in the face, and maintain with their lives, their reputation and valour. Amongst the many Sects of <HI>Hindooes</HI> or Gentiles (after spoken of) which are subject to this King, there is but one race of fighters called <HI>Rashboots,</HI> a number of which live by spoyl, who in troops surprize poor passengers, for the most part murthering those whom they get under their power. These excepted, the rest of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> natives for the generality of them had rather <HI>eate</HI> than <HI>quarrel,</HI> and rather quarrel than fight. I say quarrel, for I have several times observed there, that when two of them, have been both well armed, and have most shamefully abused one another, in baser language than I can express, yet durst not draw their weapons; in conclu∣sion, when one of them hath caught the other by the throat, and forced him up against some wall, the sufferer would cry out pitiously, and the standers by would admire the other for his valous, saying <HI>Sha-Abas;</HI> a proverbial speech amongst them relating to the late King of <HI>Persia,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="96"/>
called <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> a Prince much renowned for valour; and when any man did a thing they thought gallantly, they cryed <HI>Sha-Abas,</HI> as much to say, it was done as well as the <HI>Persian</HI> King could have done it.</P>
<P>Yet, however the people here in general are Cowardly they appear men of very terrible as∣pects, having great long <HI>Mustachos</HI> upon their upper lipps, their Chins continually kept bare by the rasor, which makes them all to look like the Pictures of our old <HI>Britaines;</HI> or like those our rude Painters daub upon clothes, and call them the <HI>Nine-worthies.</HI> And further, to make them the more formidable, they will appear on horse-back as if they were surrounded with an <HI>Armorie,</HI> or carrying an whole <HI>Armorie</HI> a∣bout them, thus appointed; At their left sides <HI>swords</HI> hanging on belts, under them sheaves of many <HI>arrowes;</HI> on their left shoulders broad <HI>Bucklers</HI> fastned, and upon their backs smal <HI>Gunns</HI> like to Carbines fixed likewise; at their right sides <HI>Bowes</HI> hanging in cases, and <HI>Lances</HI> (about two yards and an half long) hanging in loops neer their stirrops (when they carry them not in their hands) yet for all this <HI>Harness</HI> the most of them are like those <HI>Ephramites,</HI> Psal. 78. 9. <HI>Who being armed, and carrying bowes, turned their heads in the day of battell.</HI> For they dare not look a man of courage in the face, though they be thus <HI>fortified,</HI> with such
<PB N="163" REF="96"/>
variety of <HI>weapons</HI> for their defence. Nay, a man of resolution will beat one of these out of all his weapons, with a small stick or cane. So that I shall do the Natives of that Countrey no wrong, if I say of them, that they are <HI>Solâ Li∣bidine fortes,</HI> most strong and valiant in their base lusts, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>The base Cowardise of which people, hath made the great <HI>Mogol</HI> sometimes to use this Proverb, that one <HI>Portugal</HI> would beat three of his people; and (because the <HI>English</HI> there have many times prevailed much at Sea against those <HI>Portugals)</HI> he would further add, that one <HI>English-man</HI> would beat three <HI>Portu∣gals.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, that the <HI>Portugals,</HI> especially those which are born in those <HI>Indian</HI> Colonyes, most of them a mix'd seed begotten upon those Natives, are a very low, poor-spirited people, called therefore <HI>Galijnas del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mar,</HI> the Hens of the Sea.</P>
<P>One notable instance to prove this, it hap∣pened that the <HI>East India</HI> Company had a ve∣ry little <HI>Pinnace</HI> they called the <HI>Coaster,</HI> which they kept in those parts for discoveries; mann'd she was but with ten men, and had only one small <HI>murdering-peece</HI> within her. She upon a time met with a <HI>Portugal</HI> ship, going then to∣wards <HI>Ormos,</HI> which had one hundred and thir∣ty men aboard her, and Guns answerable to
<PB N="164" REF="97"/>
her burden, and Company; Our petty <HI>Pinnace</HI> came up with her, discharged her murdering peece, which slew one of her chief Officers, up∣on which, without any further resistance, she presently strook her Sayles and yeelded. Our <HI>English</HI> presently commanded her Gunners, and some other of her Chief Officers, to come a∣board them, which immediatly they did, and there kept them bound, till they had taken what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leased out of their Ship, and then let them go being most deservedly used in that their suffering, they being thirteen to one, and yet such beasts they were, as that they durst not make any resistance.</P>
<P>But take some stories of valiant <HI>Portugals</HI> before I leave them, and these you shall have from some of that Nation themselves, whom, we not seldom met in <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> &amp; would there beg relief of us; but I never knew any come to us upon those tearmes, but his <HI>pride</HI> would excuse his Poverty thus, that he was Challenged into the field, and there in single combat had fairly slain a man, how that he durst not return again any more into the <HI>Portugal Colonyes,</HI> for fear of the law, and it was that which put him at present into that sad exigent to ask relief, and this was their usual plea there, when in truth and in deed, we did believe them to be such pit∣tifull wretches, or men of such a strange resolu∣tion, as that, (as it was written of one called
<PB N="165" REF="97"/>
<HI>Pisander)</HI> they would be made to fear their own shadowes.</P>
<P>However, upon this account there came up∣on a time at my first coming into <HI>India,</HI> unto the factorie at <HI>Surat,</HI> where I then was, a most valiant <HI>Portugal</HI> (if you will give him leave to tell his own storie, and believe it when he hath done) who first for his person was a <HI>Quantus tantus, tantillus,</HI> a very poor, little dwarfish man, whose person promised as little valour as any that I ever saw, though I know that high Courage is not tyed to an huge bulk, for (if stories abuse us not) <HI>Alexander</HI> the great was But a <HI>little man;</HI> but what ever <HI>Alexander</HI> was, I am sure, that this was a poor little thing, but however he told us, that he was by birth an <HI>Hidalgo,</HI> which signifies in Spanish <HI>the Son of somebody,</HI> or no ordinary man, but a Gentle∣man of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that he came from thence as a Companion to the King of Spains <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> sent to <HI>Goa,</HI> and himself was called the <HI>Knight</HI> with the Golden <HI>Rapier,</HI> and that suddenly af∣ter his coming to <HI>Goa,</HI> he was honorably in∣vited into the field, there to fight a single Com∣bat with a very gallant man of that place, but he soon left him there dead; and having done so, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> prevented him with a pardon for that fact, before he ask'd it, but willing him withall, now he had been sufficiently tryed, to confine his <HI>Rapier</HI> to its scabard. But he told
<PB N="166" REF="98"/>
us further, that he could not long after live quietly there, but was provoked again by a man of high resolution, unto a second encoun∣ter, when he had the like success as before, in killing his Adversary. The <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> now was very angry with him, but upon much intreaty, as he said, pardoned him a second time; upon the receit of which favour he told us that he was then resolved to throw away his Rapier, to get into a Religious house, and there to remain the residue of his dayes, a <HI>Convertado</HI> or <HI>Peni∣tent.</HI> But the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> could not be long with∣out his Company, and therefore to gain it, re∣stored him again into his former favour: But for himself he was still so unhappie (the fame of his great valour being spread abroad) as that he could not long enjoy that Peace, and quiet, which he now so much desired, but received a third Challenge from a very gallant, and very valiant man, as he describ'd him, a man big enough to beat a <HI>Goliah,</HI> and then he further told us, that his honour was ever more dear unto him than his life, and therefore notwith∣standing the loss of the <HI>Vice-Royes</HI> favour, and what els might happen, he entred the lists with him, and though he found him the stoutest ad∣versary that ever he opposed, yet after a long conflict this little Knight kild that great Giant, and left him there dead likewise, which done, He (not daring to return any more unto <HI>Goa)</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="98"/>
told us, that he came naked out of the field as we then saw him with no ornaments (I assure you) about him, fit to make him a <HI>Vice-Royes</HI> cōpanion, nor any <HI>weapon</HI> fit to <HI>Dub</HI> him <HI>Knight</HI> of the Golden <HI>Rapier.</HI> He further added, that he was now resolved not to live any longer a∣mongst the Christians, but that he desireth to live amongst the <HI>English;</HI> but when we replyed that we were Christians, he cried <HI>Jesu Maria!</HI> as wondring at it, and further told us that, he never heard so before.</P>
<P>When this <HI>Rhadomantadist</HI> had ended his perillous story, it was dinner time, and the Merchants bid him to sit down with us and eat, and so he did, where certainly he layd about him more valiantly than ever he had done be∣fore in the field, giving our meat many a cut, and eating, as if he had been more than half starved. He continued with us there for some few dayes, and after, when his hunger was well satisfied, and his spirits well refreshed, he began to take some exception against his place at the Table, because he eat at the lower end thereof, saying, that the company there were but <HI>Fa∣ctors, Servants,</HI> but he was a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and therefore his due place was higher at the board, but then corrected himself, saying, that it was not to be much considered where he sate, for his place made the upper end of Table where ever he was placed, &amp; suddenly after, this <HI>Don Quixet</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="99"/>
being weary of his stay with us (though he was but too well used) and having a great minde to ramble further, told our Company, that he being an <HI>Hidalgo,</HI> it was very dishonorable for him to take entertainment upon the Tearmes he had it, and therefore desired us to make a little Purse for him, on which he would live as long as he could, and then <HI>Creep</HI> into some <HI>Desert</HI> place, and there <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>dy.</HI> And now our great <HI>Ghest,</HI> having spent all his <HI>humor,</HI> and told us all his <HI>Dream,</HI> had his desire granted in some money that was given to him, and so we parted with our <HI>Knight Errant,</HI> who lived longer than he told us he would live, for half a year after I took notice of him at the <HI>Mogols</HI> Court, and there I leave him.</P>
<P>I will now shortly relate a story of another of his Nation (and I do believe as good a Gen∣tleman as himself) who called himself <HI>Anto∣nio de la Valla.</HI> It happened, that a little before our comming thence, my Lord Am∣bassador going from his own house to dine at the <HI>English</HI> Factory in <HI>Surat,</HI> and I waiting on him, there appeared then to us a walking <HI>Skeli∣ton,</HI> most miserably clothed, the poorest, and leanest creature that ever mine eyes beheld, who faintly begg'd of him some relief, telling (what was true) that he was almost quite starv'd; the Ambassadour pittied, and relieved him, and as we returned back, found this poor Creature

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of our safe and secure living amongst the Natives there, if we do not pro∣voke them. Of their faithfulness un∣to those that entertain them as ser∣vants: for how little they serve, and yet how diligent they are, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHere first for our living in <HI>East-India,</HI> it is with as much freedom and safety, in our <HI>journeys,</HI> and <HI>Tents,</HI> when we travell; in our houses when we are more fix'd, as if we were in <HI>an army of Banners</HI> appointed for our guard; or
<PB N="171" REF="100"/>
as if the <HI>Vines</HI> and <HI>Fig-trees</HI> under which we there sit <HI>were our own.</HI></P>
<P>But there are <HI>spoylers</HI> sometimes met withall, in those Provinces, that live by their <HI>swords,</HI> and <HI>bowes,</HI> having <HI>nothing</HI> for their subsistence (because they will take no other course) but what they get by <HI>rapine</HI> and <HI>spoyl;</HI> of whom somewhat more afterward.</P>
<P>And now by the way for those <HI>villains</HI> who thus live, wherever they be, and those sturdy <HI>rogues</HI> who are next to them in guilt, by eating up the bread of the poor, having able <HI>limbs</HI> to carry them, that they may beg from house to house, and <HI>hands</HI> to receive <HI>Almes,</HI> but none to <HI>labour;</HI> both thefe being the very <HI>vermin</HI> of those Commonwealths wherein they are suffe∣red to breath, it were very well if such of these as have not deserved to be cut off by the hand of Justice, were all served as <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> dealt with two <HI>Rogues, alterum é Macedonio fugere, alterum persequi jussit.</HI> He made one of them to whip the other out of his Countrey, and so he was rid of both of them.</P>
<P>But to return unto the place from whence I am now digressed. I travelled from <HI>Surat</HI> with four <HI>Englishmen</HI> more, and about twenty of the Natives in our Company, we beginning our journey the first of <HI>January</HI> towards <HI>Sir Thomas Row,</HI> at the <HI>Mogols</HI> Court, then above
<PB N="172" REF="101"/>
four hundred miles distant from <HI>Surat.</HI> We had six wagons drawn with Oxen, in our Company, laden with rich English goods (the principal part whereof was English broad cloth) assign'd to an English Merchant at the Court, and some other Carriages we had, of all which we made a ring every night neer some large <HI>Town</HI> or <HI>Village,</HI> where we resolved to stay, and pitched our Huts within that Circle, some of us watching, and the Natives with us, every night; we went on that long journey ve∣ry safely, only in some places where there was any suspicion of danger, we had a guard of horse appointed to go with us for our defence, by the Command of <HI>Sultan Caroon</HI> the Prince, and now King, (who had his revenue out of those parts we then travelled thorough) who sent a Footman, that continually kept us company, with his letters to command a Company of Souldiers that were horsemen, to guard us where he thought good, who as they did not expect, so they would take no recompence for their paines, though we freely offered it them. But the providence of God did so order it, that though we had their company in several places, we never had need of their help for our de∣fence. The truth is, that the people there in ge∣neral are very civil, and we never had any af∣fronts or ill usage from them, if we did not first provoke them.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="101"/>
But if we did, they would not well bear it, for twice in one week at my first comming to <HI>Surat</HI> the whole town in general were in an uproar, and surrounded our house there, both times some of our English Provok'd those Na∣tives to stir against us, but by our speedy ad∣dresses unto the Governour of that place, we excusing the fault of those that ministred the occasion of their discontent, they being newly come thither, and altogether unacquainted with their customes, he presently commanded that wild Assembly to depart from our house, and so immediatly they did, we receiving no hurt at all from any of them.</P>
<P>When my Lord Ambassadour at first arri∣ved at <HI>Surat,</HI> it so was, that an English Cook he carried with him, the very first day of his comming thither, found a way to an <HI>Arme∣nian</HI> Christians house, who sold wine in that place, they call <HI>Armenian Wine.</HI> But (by the way) I do believe that there was scarce ano∣ther in that populous City of that trade; the greater shame for those whosoever they be that suffer so many unnecessary <HI>tipling-houses</HI> (in the places where they have power to restrain them) which are the Devills nursery, the very Tents wherein Sathan dwells, where Almighty God receives abundance of dishonour, drun keness being a sin which hath hands and fingers to draw all other sins unto it; For a drunkard can
<PB N="174" REF="102"/>
do any thing, or be any thing but good. That <HI>Armenian Wine</HI> I speak of is made of Reysons of the Sun and Sugar, with some other things pur and boyled in water, which Wine, when it is ripe and cleer, is in Colour like to our <HI>Mus∣cadels,</HI> pleasant enough to the tast, but heavy and heady. The Cook had his head quickly o∣ver-freighted with it, and then staggering home∣ward, in his way met the Governors Brother of <HI>Surat,</HI> as he was riding to his house, the Cook made a stand, staying himself up upon his sword &amp; scabbard, and cry'd out to the Go∣vernours Brother, <HI>Now thou Heathen dog.</HI> He not understanding his foul language, replyed civilly in his own <HI>Ca-ca-ta,</HI> which signifies, what sayest thou? the Cook answered him with his sword and scabbard, with which he strook at at him, but vvas immediatly seised on by his follovvers, and by them disarm'd and carried to Prison; the Ambassadour had present intel∣ligence of the misbehaviour of his drunken servant, and immediatly sent vvord unto the Governours Brother, that he vvas not come thither to patronize any disorderly person, and therefore desir'd him to do vvith him what he pleased, upon which he presently sent him home, not doing him the least hurt. But before I leave this storie, it will not be amiss to en∣quire who was the <HI>Heathen dog</HI> at this time, whether the debaucht drunken <HI>Cook</HI> who call'd
<PB N="175" REF="102"/>
himself a Christian, or that sober and tempe∣rate <HI>Mahometan</HI> who was thus affronted.</P>
<P>In our journey towards the <HI>Court</HI> (after we had been in our way about seven dayes from <HI>Surat)</HI> we rested at a place called <HI>Ditat,</HI> where many of the Inhabitants offered to guard us and our goods, though we (observing there no dan∣ger) desired it not, but they would do it, and in the morning expected and asked something of us, by way of recompence. One of our Com∣pany (who had been in <HI>East India</HI> a year or two before) told them, that what they had done they did without ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desire, and therefore they should have nothing from us, but some ill language which he then gave them. We set forward in the morning according to our wonted custom they followed after us, to the number at the least of three hundred men (for the place was great and populous) and when we were gone about a mile from that Town, stopped our carriages; he of our Company who told them they should have no recompence, was presently ready to shoot at them with his <HI>Mus∣ket,</HI> which made them all to bend their Bowes at us, but I happily and suddenly stepping in, prevented his firing at them, and their shooting at us, which if I had not by Gods good Provi∣dence done, but we had madly engaged such a great multitude, there could not have been less expected in the sad issue thereof, than the
<PB N="176" REF="103"/>
loss of all our lives, and goods, but having a little Parlee with them, for the value of three shillings of English money given amongst them, they were all quieted and contented, and im∣mediatly left us, wishing us a good journey.</P>
<P>After this, when we had gone forward a∣bout twenty dayes journey (which daily re∣mooves were but short, by reason of our heavy carriages, and the heat of the weather) it hap∣pened, that another of our Company, a young Gentleman about twenty years old, the Bro∣ther of a Baron of <HI>England,</HI> behaved himself so ill, as that we feared it would have brought very much mischief on us.</P>
<P>This young man being very unruly at home, and so many others that have been well born, when their friends knew not what to do with them, have been sent to <HI>East India,</HI> that so they might make their own <HI>Graves</HI> in the <HI>Sea,</HI> in their passage thither, or els have <HI>Graves</HI> made for them on the <HI>Indian</HI> shore, when they come there. A very cleanly conveyance (but how just and honest, I leave to others) for Parents to be rid of their unruly Children; but I never knew any who were thus supposed to be sent thither, but they outlived that voyage.</P>
<P>For the young Gentleman I spake of, his im∣ployment was to wait upon our chief Com∣mander in his Cabin, who very courteously when he came to Sea, turn'd him before the
<PB N="177" REF="103"/>
<HI>mast</HI> amongst the common saylors [a great pre∣ferment for a man of his birth,] but for all this he outliv'd that harsh usage, and came safely to <HI>East India,</HI> and my Lord Ambassadour hea∣ring of him, and being well acquainted with his great kindred, sent for him up to the <HI>Court,</HI> and there entertain'd him as a Companion for a year, then giving him all fit accommodati∣ons, sent him home again as a passenger for England, where after he safely arrived.</P>
<P>But in our way towards that Court, it thus happened, that this <HI>hot-brains</HI> being a little behind us, commanded him [then neer him] who was the Princes servant [before spoken of] to hold his horse, the man replyed, that he was none of his servant, and would not do it. Upon which this most intemperate mad youth, who was like <HI>Philocles</HI> that angry Poet; and therefore called <HI>Bilis, &amp; Salsigo,</HI> Choler and Brine, [for he was the most hasty and cho∣lerick young man that ever I knew] as will ap∣pear by his present carriage, which was thus; first he beat that stranger, for refusing to hold his horse, with his horse-whip, which I must tell you, that people cannot endure, as if those whips stung worse than <HI>Scopions.</HI> For of any punishments that carry most disgrace in them, as that people think one is to be beaten with that <HI>whip,</HI> where with all they strike their beasts; the other to be beaten [and this they esteem the
<PB N="178" REF="104"/>
more disgracefull punishment of the two) a∣bout the head with shooes. But this stranger (being whipt as before) came up and com∣plained to me, but to make him amends, that <HI>frantick young man</HI> (mad with rage, and he knew not wherefore) presently followed him, and being come up close to him, discharg'd his <HI>Pistol</HI> laden with a brace of <HI>bullets</HI> directly at his body, which bullets, by the special guidance of the hand of God, so flew, that they did the poor man no great hurt, only one of them first tearing his coat, brused all the knucles of his left hand and the other brake his bow which he carried in the same hand. We presently dis∣armed our young <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dlam,</HI> till he might return again to his witts. But our greatest business was how to pacifie the other man whom he had thus injured: I presently gave him a <HI>Roo∣pee;</HI> in our money two shillings and nine pence; he thanked me for it, and would have taken it with his right, but I desired him to take it with his maym'd hand, and so he did, and could clinch it very well, which I was glad of. Then we did shew (as we had cause) all the dislike we could against that desperat act of him, from whom he received his hurt, telling him, that we were all strangers, and for our parts had done him no wrong at all, and there∣fore hoped that we should not be made any way to suffer for the faults of another, and we
<PB N="179" REF="104"/>
further told him, that if he would be quiet till we came up to the <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> he should have all the satisfaction he could desire. He told us, that we were good men, and had done him no wrong, and that he would til then rest contented; but he did not so, for about two houres after we met with a great man of that Countrey, having a mighty train with him, (as al the <HI>Grandees</HI> there have when they travel (of whom more after∣ward) He presently went towards him, that to him he might make his complaint; and so did, telling him, that he was the <HI>Princes</HI> ser∣vant, why he came to us, and how he had been used by us, shewing him his hand and his other breaches. The great man replied, that it was not well done of us, but he had nothing to do with it, and so departed on his way. That night, after we came to a strong large Town, and pla∣cing our selves on the side of it, he did what he could (as we imagined) to rayse up that peo∣ple against us, some of them comming about us to view us, as we conceived, but putting on the best confidence we could, and standing then upon our guard, and all of us watching that night, but (in a special manner) by the good providence of God, who kept us in all our journey, we here felt none of that mischief we feared, but early in the morning quietly de∣parted without the least molestation. After which, with a little money, and a great many
<PB N="180" REF="105"/>
good words, we so quieted this man, that we never after heard any more complaining from him. So that (as before I observed) we were not at any time in any dangers of suffering by that people, but some of our own Nation were the procuring causes of it.</P>
<P>For the people there, they are generally very Civil, and usually keep themselves so within the bounds of command received from their su∣periours, over which they do not pass, as that they are not apt to take fire, and to throw off their voak, that they might do mischief; They happily considering, that as in a <HI>natural,</HI> so in a <HI>body Politick,</HI> there must be hands and feet, as well as <HI>head</HI> and <HI>shoulders,</HI> all parts as well as any, the defect of the least being so prejudi∣cial to both those bodyes, that they know not how to want it; But for both, when they are fitted with all their integral parts, all mem∣bers must do their several offices, the <HI>foot</HI> not medling with the business of the <HI>Head,</HI> fur∣ther than to receive Commands from it. And therefore that precept of the Apostle, Ephes. 6. 5. <HI>Servants be obedient unto them that are your Masters according to the flesh &amp;c.</HI> though they never learn'd it from S. <HI>Paul,</HI> yet having found that lesson cleerly written even in the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> with all carefulness they remember, and with all diligence they practise it, as well knowing the absolute necessity of superiority,
<PB N="181" REF="105"/>
and inferiority amongst men, that some must <HI>give,</HI> others must <HI>take command;</HI> for were it not for those <HI>cords</HI> to lead some, and to <HI>hamper</HI> and restrain others, there were no living for men amongst men, but one would destroy another, as the <HI>Beasts</HI> of the field, the <HI>Fowles</HI> of the Air, and <HI>Fishes</HI> of the Sea do; were it not for those ligaments and tyes, the very <HI>sinewes</HI> and <HI>nerves</HI> of every Kingdom and Commonwealth would crack asunder, and all would run into confu∣sion.</P>
<P>I have often heard it observed of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> that they are <HI>Optimi servi,</HI> but <HI>Pessimi Domini,</HI> ill Masters, but good servants. I shall not fur∣ther enquire into the truth of that proverbial speech; but, for this people, this I can affirm; that they are excellent servants, who are as much at the command of their Masters, as the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> after the death of <HI>Moses,</HI> were unto <HI>Joshua, Josh.</HI> 1. 17. there telling him, <HI>all that thou commandest us we will do, or whither∣soever thou sendest us we will goe;</HI> Or as the <HI>Cen∣turions</HI> servants in the <HI>Gospel</HI> were at the word of command to their Captain, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. 9. who, <HI>if he bad them go, they went, if come, they came, if do this, or that, they did it:</HI> So these, if they be commanded to carry letters of a sud∣den many miles distant, from one place to ano∣ther, they yield obedience in this, as to all other the commands of their Masters, without regret
<PB N="182" REF="106"/>
or dispute, not <HI>objecting</HI> against, but doing the wills of those that imploy them.</P>
<P>Before I observed, that for the generality of this people they have very low and timorous spirits, but there are some I named in my last Section, who are stout daring men, as the <HI>Ba∣loches, Patans,</HI> and <HI>Rashbootes,</HI> who, as they have the honour above all the rest of the people in those large Provinces to be accounted va∣liant; so, as occasion is offered, they will shew themselves so to be: and therefore they are much hyred as Convoyes to secure mens Per∣sons and goods, from place to place.</P>
<P>For those Provinces, they are not without <HI>Mountains of prey, and Tabernacles of Robbers,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> speak, where desperate men keep in some <HI>woods</HI> and <HI>deserts,</HI> which are not far from great road-wayes, most frequented &amp; used, and there, like the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> in Com∣panies meet, and spoyl, and destroy poor pas∣sengers, when they expect them not; it being the cursed manner of those <HI>spoylers,</HI> if they pre∣vail against; them whom they surprise, to kill them before they rifle them, and therefore the first thing heard from them is, <HI>Mor, mor, mor,</HI> that is, Kill, kill, kill, which they all speak out as loud as they can. We were often told of them as we travelled sometimes in the night, by rea∣son of the extreme heat of the day, after we had taken leave of the King; and so wer jour|
<PB N="183" REF="106"/>
journeying towards <HI>Surat,</HI> that we should meet with those cruell <HI>villans,</HI> but, through Gods mercy, we were never in danger of them but once, and that was about midnight, neer a large City called <HI>Brodera,</HI> but we being a competent number of English men together, about twenty, and all of us resolved to fell our lives at as dear a rate as we could, and having twice so many <HI>Indian</HI> servants with us, which are very nimble with their Bows and Arrowes, we with our Pistols and Carbines, which we presently discharged amongst them, and our <HI>In∣dians</HI> plying them with their arrowes, made them suddenly to retreat, we receiving little hurt from them, but after this we made no more night <HI>marches.</HI></P>
<P>Those <HI>Indians</HI> I named before, are so faith∣full to their trusts unto whomsoever they en∣gage, to the <HI>English</HI> as well as to any <HI>other,</HI> that if they be at any time assaulted, they will rather dye in their defence, than forsake them at their need. So that I am very confident, that if an English Merchant should travel alone with a very great treasure in <HI>gold,</HI> and <HI>Jewels,</HI> both, or either, from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Lahor,</HI> which is more than one thousand English miles, and take those <HI>Indian</HI> servants only for his compa∣ny, and guard, and all they knew what be car∣ried with him, He paying them their wages, they would be so far from injuring him of the
<PB N="184" REF="107"/>
least penny of his wealth, that whosoever be∣sides should attempt his spoyling, must make a way through their blood, before they should be able to do it</P>
<P>Here is a great and good example of Faith∣fulness, and it is very true. But I much doubt, that if a great <HI>Indian</HI> Merchant, I mean a na∣tive of that Countrey, should come for <HI>England</HI> with the like treasure, with a desire to pass through this whole nation, and should for his more safe passage take a guard of sword∣men here, and pay them well for their service, they might lye under such a strong tentation, as might make them to spoyl the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> by shortning his journey, dividing his substance, and by disposing so of his person, that it should never tell tales.</P>
<P>But for that people, as their faithfulness is ve∣ry remarkable, so is their diligence very exem∣plary likewise; for they keep continually within the call of their Masters, and will not at any time depart thence without special leave. And the plenty of all provisions being very great throughout the whole <HI>Monarchy,</HI> they serve at very low rates, which I never knew them to rayse, not requiring more than five shillings ster∣lings every new Moon, payd the next day after its Change, which is all the recompence they do desire, or expect from their Masters, to provide themselves with all necessaries</P>

<Q><L>Their coat, their shooes, their bread, their fire,</L>

<P>And for this do as good service, as if they had ten times as much wages.</P>
<P>They stand to be hyred in the <HI>Bazar</HI> or Mar∣ket-place, an antient custom, as may appear, <HI>Matth.</HI> 20. 3. where some of them may be at all times had.</P>
<P>But it is their manner, when they are hyred to receive advance-money, that is, one moneths pay before hand, and to have their pay thus in hand every moneth so long as they serve, and so honest they are, that if they be bidden to pro∣vide themselves of other Masters, they will serve out the time for which they have received pay, to an hour before, they depart.</P>
<P>Now these who are so exact in performing their dutie by their faithfulness and diligence, must be exactly paid their <HI>Salary</HI> at the time they expect it, otherwise they will be ready to quit their service, as one of them whom we thus hyred, left us as we we were travelling up to the <HI>Court,</HI> the reason, because our money was almost quite gone (though we were supplyed again a day or two after) and we could not punctually pay him at his day, as we had for∣merly
<PB N="186" REF="108"/>
done. This fellow led one of our <HI>Ca∣mels,</HI> and had been with us two moneths be∣fore, but upon this little fayling him, would needs leave us, but before he departed he made a speech to his <HI>Camel,</HI> telling him, that he had led him thus long, and had during that time lived by him, but now our money (as he sup∣posed) quite fayling, he told him that he must begon, desiring God to bless him, and that he might have some other to lead him that might not be less carefull of him than he had been. So he took leave of his <HI>Camel,</HI> though not of us, and departed. All the rest of his company were perswaded to continue with us, and had their pay a day or two after, and so we proceeded on our journey, and so shall I further in this dis∣course.

<HEAD>SECTION IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their buildings in Villages, Townes, and Cities. How their Houses are fur∣nished. Of their Sarraes or houses for the entertainment of Passengers. Of their Tents, Wells, and of their places of pleasure, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Observed before the Richness of their Soyl, and how those Provinces are watered by ma∣ny goodly Rivers, fed with abundance of Springs and how their fields are clothed with very much plenty of <HI>Corn</HI> of divers kind, sold there at such low rates that every one may there eat bread without scarceness.</P>
<P>Now I come to take notice of their buildings; and here I must tell my Reader, that this people are not much taken or infected with that plague of building (as the <HI>Italians</HI> call it) wishing the love of it as a Curse to posses the thoughts of them they most hate; and there∣fore, as the <HI>stones</HI> in <HI>India</HI> are not all precious, so the <HI>houses</HI> there are not at all <HI>Palaces;</HI> the poor there cannot erect for their dwellings fair <HI>Piles,</HI> and the <HI>Grandees</HI> do not cover their heads under such curious <HI>Roofs,</HI> as many of the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> doe; the reason, first, because all the
<PB N="188" REF="109"/>
great men there live a great part of the year, (in which their Moneths are more temperate, as from the middle of <HI>September,</HI> to the middest of <HI>April)</HI> in <HI>Tents, Pavilions,</HI> or moveable ha∣bitations, which, according to their Fancyes, they remoove from place to place, changing their air as often as they please. And secondly, because all the great men there have their <HI>Pen∣sions</HI> and whole subsistence from the <HI>King,</HI> which they hold upon very fickle and uncertain tearmes; for as they are setled upon, and con∣tinued unto them by the Kings favour, so are they forfeited and lost by his frown. Of which more afterward.</P>
<P>Yet though they make not much use of them, they have in plenty, excellent good materials for building, as Timber, Bricks, stone and marble of divers kinds and colours, of which I have seen some very good <HI>Vaults</HI> and <HI>Arches,</HI> well wrought, as in their <HI>Mosquits</HI> or Churches, so in some of their high erected <HI>Tombos,</HI> (of which more afterward) and so in some other places likewise.</P>
<P>For their buildings in Cities and Towns, there are some of them handsome, others fair, such as are inhabited by Merchants, and none of them very despicable.</P>
<P>They build their houses <HI>low,</HI> not above two <HI>stories,</HI> and many of their topps <HI>flat,</HI> and <HI>thick,</HI> which keep off the violence of the heat, and
<PB N="189" REF="109"/>
those flat topps supported with strong Timber, and coated over with a <HI>plaster</HI> (like that we call plaster of <HI>Paris)</HI> keep them dry in the times of the <HI>Raines.</HI></P>
<P>Those broad <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arases,</HI> or flat <HI>Roofs,</HI> some of them loftie, are places where many people may stand (and so they often doe) early in the mor∣ning, and in the evening late, like <HI>Camelions,</HI> to draw, and drink in fresh <HI>ayr;</HI> and they are made after this fashion, for <HI>prospect,</HI> as well as <HI>pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>After this manner (as it appeares in the sa∣cred storie) the Jewes were wont to build, for <HI>David from the Roof of his house,</HI> 2 Sam. 11. 2. <HI>espies an object, &amp;c.</HI> such a one, as if God had not been very mercifull, was sufficient to have undone him for ever, as they write of the <HI>Basi∣lisk,</HI> that it kills by sight.</P>
<P>By the way, let me here further adde, that <HI>Davids</HI> eyes thus wandred to fetch home a temptation, immediatly after he had risen from the bed of idlleness and ease; for while he was imployed in <HI>business,</HI> he was <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>safe.</HI> The <HI>industrious</HI> have not such leisure to <HI>sin,</HI> as the <HI>idle</HI> have, who have neither <HI>leisure,</HI> nor <HI>power</HI> to avoid <HI>it. Exercise,</HI> as it is wholesome for the <HI>body,</HI> even so for the <HI>soul.</HI> The remissi∣on whereof breeds diseases in both.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> from the roof of his house sees <HI>Bath∣sheba,</HI> when probably she saw not him; lust is
<PB N="190" REF="110"/>
quick-sighted. <HI>David</HI> had no sooner seen that object, but his eyes presently <HI>betray,</HI> and re∣coyl upon his <HI>Heart,</HI> smiting it with sinfull desires, which made him to covet her; and pre∣sently to send for her, that he might enjoy her.</P>
<P>That which <HI>David</HI> here did, (and after∣ward grievously repents for so doing,) shall one day be the wofull song of many a wretched soul; as the <HI>Lascivious</HI> mans song; the <HI>Covetous</HI> mans song, the song of <HI>Theeves, Idolaters, Glut∣tons, Drunkards,</HI> as of <HI>others. I saw, I coveted, I took,</HI> for all these receive their <HI>death,</HI> by their <HI>eye.</HI></P>
<P>There <HI>Bathsheba</HI> was washing herself from her uncleaness, and presently after in an Adul∣terous bed, became more unclean than ever she was before; never was <HI>Bathsheba</HI> more foul than when she was newly washed, the <HI>worst</HI> of <HI>na∣ture</HI> being <HI>cleanliness</HI> to the <HI>best</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> But I proceed.</P>
<P>Those houses of two stories, have many of them very large upper roomes, which have ma∣ny double doores in the sides of them, like those in our <HI>Balconies,</HI> to open and let in fresh air, which is likewise conveyed in unto them, by many lesser lights made in the walls of those roomes, which are always free and open; The use of glass windows, or any other shuttings, be∣ing not known there, nor in any other very hot Countreyes.</P>
<P>Neither have they any Chimneyes in their
<PB N="191" REF="110"/>
buildings, because they never make any use of fire but to dress their food, which fire they make against some firm wall, or without their <HI>Tents</HI> against some bank of <HI>Earth,</HI> as remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as may be from the places where they use to keep, that they may receive no annoyance from the heat thereof.</P>
<P>It is their manner in many places, to plant a∣bout, and amongst their buildings, trees which grow high and broad, the shadow whereof keeps their houses by far more cool; this I ob∣served in a special manner when we were ready to enter <HI>Amadavar,</HI> for it appeared to us, as if we had been entring a Wood, rather than a City. That <HI>Amadavar</HI> is a very large and po∣pulous City, entred by many fair Gates girt a∣bout with an high and thick Wall of Brick, which mounts above the topps of their houses, without which wall there are no suburbs. Most of the houses within the City are of Brick, and very many of them ridged &amp; covered with tiles.</P>
<P>But for their houses in their <HI>Aldeas,</HI> or <HI>Vil∣lages,</HI> which stand very thick in that Country, they are generally very <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>base.</HI> All those Countrey dwellings are set up close together, for I never observed any house there to stand single, and alone. Some of their houses in those villages are made with earthen walls, mingled with straw, set up immediatly after their <HI>Raines,</HI> and having a long season after to dry them
<PB N="192" REF="111"/>
throughly, stand firm, and so continue; they are built low, and many of them flat: but for the generality of those Countrey <HI>Villages,</HI> the <HI>Cottages</HI> in them are miserably <HI>poor, little,</HI> and <HI>base;</HI> so that as they are built with a very little charge, set up with sticks rather than Timber, (if they chance to fire, as many times they do) for a very little they may be reedified.</P>
<P>Those who inhabit the Countrey Villages, are called <HI>Coolees,</HI> these till the ground, and breed up Cattel, and other things for provision, as <HI>Henns</HI> &amp;c. These they who plant the <HI>Sugar,</HI> the <HI>Cotten-wooll,</HI> and <HI>Indico</HI> &amp;c.—for their <HI>Trades</HI> and <HI>manifactures</HI> they are kept in <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Towns,</HI> about which are their choicest fruits planted. In their Cities and Towns, without their dwellings, but fix't to them, are <HI>pend∣houses</HI> where they shew and sell their provisions, as bread, and <HI>flower-Cakes</HI> made up with <HI>Su∣gar,</HI> and fruits, and other things, and there they shew their manifactures, and other Com∣modities, some of which they carry twice every day to sell in the <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market.</P>
<P>I saw two houses of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> one at <HI>Man∣doa,</HI> the other at <HI>Amadaver,</HI> which appeared large and stately, built of excellent stone well squared and put together, each of them taking up a large compass of ground, but we could ne∣ver see how they were contrived, within because there▪ are none admitted, strangers or others, to
<PB N="193" REF="111"/>
have a sight of those houses, while the <HI>Kings wives</HI> and women are there, which must not be <HI>seen</HI> by any but by <HI>himself,</HI> and his <HI>servants</HI> the <HI>Eunuchs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mogols</HI> Palace Royal is at <HI>Agra</HI> his <HI>Metropolis</HI> (of which more afterward) but for the present I shall take a little notice of a very curious <HI>Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> I saw belonging to his house at <HI>Mandoa,</HI> which stood a small distance from it, for the building of which there was a way made into a firm Rock, which shewed it self on the side of an Hill, <HI>Canopied</HI> over with part of that Rock. It was a place that had much beauty in it by reason of the Curious work-manship bestowed on it; and much pleasure by reason of its cooleness.</P>
<P>That City <HI>Mandoa</HI> I speak of, is situated upon a very high mountain, the to whereof is flat, and plain, and specious. From all parts that lye about it but one, the ascent is very high, and steep; and the way to us seemed exceeding long, for we were two whole dayes Climbing up the Hill, with our Cariages, vvhich vve got up vvith very much difficulty; not far from the bottom of vvhich Hill, vve lodged at a great tovvn called <HI>Achabar-pore,</HI> vvhere vve ferried over a broad River (as vve did in other places) for I observed no bridges made there, over any of their Rivers vvhere their high-vvayes lye. That Hill on vvhich <HI>Mandoa</HI> stands, is stuck∣round
<PB N="194" REF="112"/>
(as it vvere) vvith fair trees, that keep their distance so one from and belovv the other, that there is much delight in beholding them either from the bottom or top of that Hill.</P>
<P>In those vast and far extended woods, there are <HI>Lions, Tygres,</HI> and other beasts of Prey, and many wild <HI>Elephants.</HI> We lay one night in that wood with our Carriages, and those <HI>Lions</HI> came about us discovering themselves by their Roaring, but we keeping a very good fire all night, they came not neer enough to hurt ei∣ther our selves, or cattel; those Cruel Beasts are night-walkers, for in the day they appear not.</P>
<P>After (when through Gods most gracious assistance) we had overcome those difficulties, and dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, we came into a plain and even Countrey in which travelling a few dayes more we first met with my Lord Ambassador mar∣ching towards <HI>Mandoa</HI> with that great King, with whom I then setled, and continued with him, till he was returned home.</P>
<P>We were in our journey to the Court from the beginning of <HI>January</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ill the end of <HI>March,</HI> we resting a while at <HI>Brampore,</HI> which is a very spacious and populous City, where we had a Factorie. And after that, we were vio∣lently deteined in our journey by <HI>Sultan Caroon</HI> the Prince, vvhom vve met in his march to∣vvards <HI>Brampore,</HI> &amp; a very marvelous great re∣tinue with him. The reason why he interrupted
<PB N="195" REF="112"/>
us in our course was, that he might see the pre∣sents we had for his Father the King; but we having command from the Ambassador to tell him, that we durst not open them, till we came to the King, we most humbly craved his pardon to spare us in that; so presenting him with a pair of Rich <HI>Gloves</HI> (though they be things they wear not in those hot Countryes) and a rich embrodered bag for perfume (which amongst many other things of the like kinde were brought from <HI>England</HI> to be given away for presents, after that he had carried us back three dayes journey, he let us go, taking further order for our safe Convoy.</P>
<P>And now Reader, thou mayst suppose us al∣most setled in <HI>Mandoa,</HI> the place then of the <HI>Mogols</HI> residence, not much inhabited before we came thither, having more <HI>ruines</HI> by far a∣bout it, than standing <HI>houses.</HI> But amongst the Piles of building that had held up their heads above <HI>Ruin,</HI> there were not a few unfrequen∣ted <HI>Mosquits</HI> or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Churches; yet I observed, that though the people who attended the King there, were marvailously streightned for room, wherein they might dispose of very great numbers of most excellent horses, which were now at that place, they would not make stables of any of those Churches, though before that time, they had been forsaken, and out of use.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="113"/>
One of those deserted <HI>Mosquites,</HI> with some large <HI>Tomb</HI> neer it, both vaulted over head (which shall be after described) were the best places there to be gotten for my Lord Ambas∣sadour and his Company to lodge and be in, we carrying our bedding, and all things apper∣tayning thereto, all necessaries belonging to our Kitchin, and every thing beside for bodily use, from place to place, as we occasionally remoo∣ved. Here we stayed with the <HI>Mogol</HI> from the middle of <HI>April,</HI> till the twentieth of <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> following and then began our progress with him, towards the City <HI>Amadavar.</HI></P>
<P>Our abiding place at <HI>Mandoa,</HI> was very neer one of the sides of that vast wilderness, out of which, some of those wild beasts ofttimes in the night came about our habitation, and sel∣dom returned back without a <HI>Sheep</HI> or a <HI>Goate,</HI> or a <HI>Kid,</HI> some of which we always kept about us for our provision. And it was a wonderfull great mercy, those furious, and ravening, and and hungerbit Creatures, did not make their prey sometimes, in the dark and silent nights, while we were sleeping, on some of our bodyes, the fore-part of our dwelling standing upon pillars, and there was nothing in those open di∣stances, that had any strength in it to keep them from us.</P>
<P>One night, early in the evening, there was a great <HI>Lion</HI> which we saw, came into our yard,
<PB N="197" REF="113"/>
though our yard was compassed about with a stone-wall, that was not low.) And my Lord Ambassadour having a little white neat <HI>shock,</HI> that ran out barking at him, the Lion prefently snapt him up, leapt again over the wall, and a∣way he went.</P>
<P>But for a ravening and roaring <HI>Lion,</HI> as I be∣lieve that he cannot be made tame when he is old; yet certainly he may be bred tame, being kept full, and high fed. For the <HI>Mogol,</HI> at my being there, had a very great <HI>Lion</HI> (I often saw) which went up and down, amongst the people that frequented his Court, gently as a dog, and never did hurt only he had some Keepers which did continually wayt upon him.</P>
<P>For those wild and Cruell Beasts, one of our <HI>English-men</HI> watching in a tree by night; (that stood not far from our dwelling) with a fire-lock charged with some small bullets, shot a <HI>Tygre,</HI> and kill'd him stone▪ dead, as he was comming towards us. It was a large Beast, higher than an <HI>Irish-Greyhound,</HI> with Grizled hayr, a long head, and sharp and short picked eares, having a mouth filled with cruell teeth; after which (we usually keeping a little fire without our house every night) were not so much troubled with those night-walkers.</P>
<P>Now to return to that from which I am oc∣casionally digressed. I told you before what their buildings are. And now for the furniture
<PB N="198" REF="114"/>
that the greatest men have in them, it is <HI>Curta supellex,</HI> very little; they being not beautified with hangings, nor with any thing besides to line their walls, but where they are best adorned, they are kept very white, and set off with a little neat painting and nothing else; for they have no <HI>Chaires,</HI> nor <HI>stooles,</HI> nor <HI>couches,</HI> nor <HI>tables,</HI> nor <HI>bedds,</HI> enclosed with <HI>Canopies,</HI> or <HI>Curtains,</HI> in any of their rooms. And the truth is, that if they had them, the extreme heat there would forbid the use of many of them; all their brave∣ry is upon their <HI>sloores,</HI> all which are made even with fine earth, or plaster, on which they spead their most excellent <HI>Carpets</HI> in their Tents, as well as in their dwelling houses, laying some Coarse thing under to preserve them; on which they sit as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aylors</HI> on their shop-boards, when they meet together, putting off their shooes (which they usually wear as slippers and their feet bare in them) when they come to tred up∣on those soft <HI>Pavements,</HI> and keeping them off till they remoove thence, this helps to keep cool their feet, and is very pleasant in those hot Countreyes. On those Carpets they sleep in the night time, or else upon an hard quilt, or lying upon a slight and low bed-stead they call a <HI>Cot,</HI> bottomed with broad girt-web made of <HI>Cotten-Wool.</HI> But where ever they lye, they stretch themselves out at their full length when they go to sleep, usually upon their backs, without any
<PB N="199" REF="114"/>
pillow, or bolster, to raise up their heads. Very many of the meaner sort of people (as I have often observed) lye thus stretched out to take their rest upon the ground, in the dry sea∣son of the year, with a white Callico Cloth spread all over them, which makes them to appear like so many dead corps layd forth for burial. This lying so even, and at length with their bodyes thus extended, may be one reason why the people there are all so streight lim'd, having none crooked amongst them, and another, because they never girt, nor lace in their bodies (as before was observed). Some of those slight bedsteads, they call <HI>Cotts,</HI> in their standing houses hang by rops, a little above ground, which are fastned to the four corners thereof; moved gently up and down, by their servants, to lull them asleep</P>
<P>They have no <HI>Inns</HI> in those parts for the en∣tertainment of strangers, but in some great Townes large Houses they call <HI>Sarraas</HI> very substantially built, with brick, or stone, where any passengers may find house-room and use it without any recompence; but there is nothing to be had beside room, all other things they must provide and bring with them, as when they lodge in Tents.</P>
<P>Amongst their buildings I must take special notice of their <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Tankes,</HI> upon both which in very many places they bestow excee∣ding
<PB N="200" REF="115"/>
much cost in stone-work; for their <HI>Wells</HI> which are fed with Springs, they make them round, but very wide and large. They are wrought up with firm stones layd in fine Pla∣ster; they usually cover those Wells with a buil∣ding over head, and with <HI>Oxen</HI> draw water out of them, which riseth up in many small Buckets, whereof some are alwayes going down, others continually comming up, and emptying them∣selves, in troughs, or little rills, made to receive, and Convey the water whither they please.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Tanks</HI> are made in low places, and many of them very deep and large, one mile, and some of them much more in compass, made round or four square, or in more squares, about which there is a low stone-wall, that hath ma∣ny doors in it, and within that wall steps, made one below the other round about it, that go down to the bottom thereof, (which is paved likewise) those steps are made of well squared lasting stone, layd firm, and even in very good order, for people that have not plenty of water otherwise, to go down and take it. These great receptacles of water, are made neer places that are very populous, fill'd when that long season of rain (before spoken of) comes, immediatly before which time, they clense them, that the water may be more cleer, and wholsom. They hold water all the dry season of the year.</P>
<P>For their places of pleasure, they are in their
<PB N="201" REF="115"/>
Groves, where their curious fruit-trees (before described) grow; but especially in their Gardens, wherein they plant little vineyards that afford marvailous fair &amp; sweet Grapes, which they cut green, for their eating, or make Reisons of them. But for Wine, they make none, because their <HI>Mahomet</HI> forbids the drinking thereof. In those Gardens likewise, they have many <HI>Pome-Granat-trees,</HI> with all other of the choy∣sest <HI>fruits</HI> and <HI>flowers</HI> their Countrey affords; to which nature daily yields such a supply, as that there is beauty to be seen in those trees, and plants, and that continually. In the middle of those Gardens, they have such Wells (as be∣fore are described) the topps whereof stand a good deal higher than the planted ground, which lyes even, and flat below them, from whence water is conveyed in narrow open pas∣sages, (they knowing not the use of leaden Pipes) to all the parts of them in the dry season of the year. In those Gardens likewise they have little round <HI>Tanks</HI> to bath in; whose sides and Bot∣tomes are made firm and smooth with that plaster before named; they are fil'd by <HI>aqua∣ducts</HI> from those Wells, and they can empty them when they please, as well as fill them. The water that is conveyed into those small <HI>Tanks,</HI> usually runns down broad stone Tables, that have many Hollowes made in them, like to <HI>scollop-shels,</HI> with water in its passage, makes
<PB N="202" REF="116"/>
such a pretty murmure, as helps to tye their senses with the bonds of sleep, in the hot sea∣sons of the day when they constantly keep their houses, and then they lye down neer them on their Carpetts, to be lul'd asleep. Those Bathing places are within, or very neer their Garden-houses, which usually are by far more neat, than any other of their dwelling.</P>
<P>In such a Garden-house, with all those ac∣commodations about it, my Lord Ambassadour lay with his company at <HI>Surat,</HI> the last three moneths before he left <HI>East India.</HI></P>
<P>And further, in those hot seasons of the day; the people of better quality lying or sitting on their <HI>Carpets,</HI> or <HI>Pallats,</HI> have servants standing about them, who continually beat the Air up∣pon them with <HI>Flabellas,</HI> or <HI>Fanns,</HI> of stiffened leather, which keeps off the flyes from annoy∣ing them, and cool them as they lye. Thus ta∣king their ease, they call for <HI>Barbers,</HI> who very gently gripe their armes, and shoulders, and other parts, they can in any measure grasp, and they strike likewise very softly those parts with the sides of their hands; it is very pleasing as they do it, and causeth their blood to stir in their veins, it is therefore very much used in those parts, to such as do not heat their blood by bodily motion.</P>
<P>For their pastimes within doores, they have <HI>Cards,</HI> but much different from ours in the fi∣gures
<PB N="203" REF="116"/>
made in them, and in their greater num∣ber of suits. Those Cards I have often seen and have been more often told, that they have very good skill in that most innocent and ingenious game we call <HI>Chests.</HI></P>
<P>They delight themselves sometimes with the Company of <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> and <HI>Juglers;</HI> for their <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> they keep venemous <HI>Snakes</HI> in baskets, and will suffer themselves to be bitten or stung by them; which part thus bitten, or stung, presently swells, and immediatly after that, they cure themselves again by <HI>Oyles</HI> and <HI>Pouders,</HI> which they apply unto the place, and then offer to sell them unto the people standing by.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Juglers</HI> are the cunningst that ever I saw, to do strange things by sleight of hand; as in this trick I shall here name, where I have ob∣served them to lay down <HI>scu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tles</HI> or broad open wicker <HI>Basketts</HI> upon the ground, three or four one upon another, all which appeared empty, as they laid them down; but taking them up a∣gain one after the other, in the bottom of them there would appear, three or four living <HI>Turtle-doves:</HI> which they would cover again with the same <HI>scuttles,</HI> and tossing and turning them as they took them off, and up the second time, none of those <HI>pretty creatures</HI> were to be seen any more. But how they first conveyed them thither, and how after thence, we could not possibly discover.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="117"/>
For their Pastimes abroad they have <HI>Hawks</HI> of divers kinds, greater and less, and Partridges, and other choise Fowl grear store to fly at. They have Hares, and Antilops, with other wild Beasts to hunt, and these not a few. Their doggs for chafe are made somewhat like our Grey∣hounds, but much less, who never open in the pursute of their game. They hunt likewise with Leopards train'd up and made fit for their sport, who by leaping seize on that they pursue; but by reason of the heat of the Countrey, those sports are not there much used. The <HI>Mogol</HI> when he hunts, carryes Hawks and Doggs, and all things beside with him, to make him Pastime, that if one sport fail, he may be plea∣sed with another.</P>
<P>They say, that they have a curious devise to take wild fouls that use the water, into which a fellowgoes, with a foul of that kinde he desires to catch, whose skin is stussed so artificially, as that with a noyse he counterfets of that foul, it appears to be alive, the man keeps all his bo∣dy but head under water, on which he fastens that counterfet foul to stand foreright on the top thereof, and thus comming amongst them, he plucks them (as they say) by their leggs un∣der water at his pleasure. But this I have only by tradition.</P>
<P>For other Pastimes abroad, this I am sure of, that when the weather is more temperate, they
<PB N="205" REF="117"/>
shoot much in their Bowes, and are very ex∣cellent Marks-men, somewhat like <HI>those left∣handed men</HI> spoken of <HI>Judg.</HI> 20. 16. And with their Gunns in which they shoot single bullets (for they have not the use of small shot) they are somewhat long in taking their aim, but they will come very neer the mark.</P>
<P>Others delight themselves very much in ma∣naging their excellent Horses; But so shall not I delight my Reader, if I dwell too long in par∣ticulars. And therefore having spoken of their buildings, I shall now invite him, though not to eat, or taste, yet to take notice</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their Diet, their Cookery in dressing it, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AND though this Countrey affords very much variety of excellent good provisions, yet the <HI>Mahometans</HI> feed not freely on any flesh, but on that which is strange, and forbidden (of the <HI>Hindooes</HI> diet I shall speak afterwards) but for the <HI>Mahometans</HI> they are a people, as I conceive, not much given to their Palate, but are very carefull of, and temperate in their diet,
<PB N="206" REF="118"/>
as having learn'd by experience, that full bel∣lyes do more oppress, than strengthen the body, that too much of the Creature doth not com∣fort but destroy Nature. It being a tryed truth, that Gluttony reacheth, and kills those whom swords cannot touch. All diseases of the body for the most part being contracted to it by sur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etts, in one kinde or other, and therefore they keep themselves to a thin diet, and eat not to pamper and please their appetite, but to satisfy and support nature, which is contented with a little every where, but with less in hot Coun∣treyes, where mens digestion of food is not so quick and good; this being further a tried truth, that those bodyes are most strong, active, and healthy, which are most temperate.</P>
<P>Therefore though they have abundance of flesh and foul, and have fish too, yet are they temperate in all of them. For Swines flesh it is an abomination unto the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and therefore they touch it not. And for other kinde of flesh, they eat very little of them alone, to make their full meals of them, for they dress no kinde of flesh in great peeces, or whole joynts, nor scarce any of their Foules whole.</P>
<P>For boyling of flesh in water, or Baking or Rosting any flesh, are peeces of Cookery (if I observed well) they know not; but they stew all their flesh as their Kid, and other Venison, &amp;c. cut into sippets, or flices, or little parts, to
<PB N="207" REF="118"/>
which they put Onions and Herbs and Roots, and Ginger (which they take there Green out of earth) and other Spices, with some Butter, which ingredients when as they are well pro∣portioned, make a food that is exceedingly pleasing to all Palates, at their first tasting there∣of most savoury meat, happily that very dish which <HI>Jacob</HI> made for his Father <HI>Isaac,</HI> when he got the blessing <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.</P>
<P>With their flesh and herbs, &amp;c. they some∣times stew Henns and other foul cut in peeces, which is like that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call an <HI>Olio,</HI> but more toothsome.</P>
<P>But their great common standing dish there is Rice, which they boyl with more art than we: for they boyl the grain so as that it is full and plump and tender, but not broken in boyling: they put to it a little green Ginger, and Pepper, and Butter, and this is the ordinary way of their dressing it and so tis very good.</P>
<P>Sometimes they boyl peeces of flesh, or Hens, and other foul cut in peeces in their Rice, which dish they call <HI>Pillaw;</HI> as they order it, they make it a very excellent, and a very well-tasted food.</P>
<P>Once my Lord Ambassadour had an enter∣tainment there by <HI>Asaph Chan,</HI> who invited him to dinner (and this was the only respect in that kinde he ever had, while he was in <HI>East In∣dia)</HI> That <HI>Asaph Chan</HI> was a man made by
<PB N="208" REF="119"/>
his great alliances, the greatest subject and fa∣vourit in all that Empire; for his sister was the <HI>Mogols</HI> most beloved wife, and his daughter was married unto <HI>Sultan Caroon</HI> the Prince, and very much beloved by him, but of all these, more afterward.</P>
<P>This <HI>Asaph Chan</HI> entertained my Lord Am∣bassadour in a very spacious and a very beauti∣full Tent, where none of his followers besides my self, saw, or tasted of that entertainment.</P>
<P>That Tent was kept full of a very pleasant Perfume; in which sents the King and Gran∣dees there take very much delight. The floor of the Tent was first covered all over with very rich and large Carpets, which were covered a∣gain in the places where our dinner stood, with other good Carpets, made of stich't Leather, to preserve them which were richer; and these were covered again with pure white and fine Callico Clothes, and all these covered with ve∣ry many dishes of silver, but for the greater part of those silver dishes they were not larger than our largest trencher-plates, the brimms of all of them gilt.</P>
<P>We sate in that large Room as it were in a Triangle; The Ambassadour on <HI>Asaph Chans</HI> right hand a good distance from him, and my self below; all of us on the ground, as they there all do when as they eat, with our faces looking each to the other, and every one of us had his
<PB N="209" REF="119"/>
several mess. The Ambassadour had more dishes by ten, and I less by ten, than our enter∣tainer had, yet for my part I had fifty dishes. They were all set before us at once, and little paths left betwixt them, that our entertainers servants (for onely they waited) might come and reach them to us one after another, and so they did. So that I tasted of all set before me, and of most did but tast, though all of them ta∣sted very well.</P>
<P>Now of the provision it self, for our larger dishes, they were filled with Rice, dressed (as before described) And this Rice was presented to us, some of it white, in its own proper co∣lour, some of it made yellow with Saffron, and some of it was made green, and some of it put into a purple colour, but by what ingredient I know not, but this I am sure, that it all tasted very well; And with Rice thus ordered several of our dishes were furnished; and very many more of them with flesh of several kinds, and with Hens, and with other sorts of foul cut in peeces, as before I observed in <HI>their Indian Cookery.</HI></P>
<P>To these we had many Jellie, and Culices; Rice ground to flower, and then boyled, and after sweetned with Sugar-Candy and Rose-water to be eaten cold. The flower of Rice mingled with sweet Almonds, made as small as they could, and with some of the most fleshy
<PB N="210" REF="120"/>
parts of Henns, stewed with it, and after, the flesh so beaten into peeces, that it could not be discern'd, all made sweet with <HI>Rose-water</HI> and <HI>Suger-Candy,</HI> and sented with <HI>Amber-Grec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;</HI> this was another of our dishes, and a most lus∣cious one, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> call <HI>Mangee Real,</HI> Food for a King. Many other dishes we had, made up in <HI>Cakes,</HI> of several formes, of the finest of the wheat-flower, mingled with <HI>Almonds,</HI> and <HI>Sugar Candy,</HI> whereof some were sented and some not. To these <HI>Potatoes</HI> ex∣cellently well dressed; and to them divers <HI>Salads</HI> and the curious fruits of that Countrey, some preserved in <HI>Sugar,</HI> and others raw, and to these many <HI>Roots</HI> Candied, <HI>Almonds</HI> blanched, <HI>Rey∣sons</HI> of the Sun, <HI>Prunellas,</HI> and I know not what, of all enough to make up that number of dishes before named; and with these <HI>quelque chose,</HI> was that entertainment made up.</P>
<P>And it was better a great deal, than if it had consisted of full &amp; heaped up dishes, such as are sometimes amongst us provided, for great and profuse entertainments. Our bread was of very good excellent wheat, made up very white and light, in round <HI>Cakes;</HI> and for our drink, some of it was brew'd for ought I know, ever since <HI>Noah his flood,</HI> that good innocent water, being all the drink there commonly used (as before) and in those hot Clymates (it being better digested there than in other parts)
<PB N="211" REF="120"/>
it is very sweet, and allayes thirst better than a∣ny other liquor can, and therefore better plea∣seth, and agreeth better with every man, that comes and lives there, than any other drink.</P>
<P>At this entertainment we sat long, and much longer than we could with ease cross leg'd, but all considered, our feast in that place was better than <HI>Apicius,</HI> that famous <HI>Epicure</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> with all his witty Gluttony (for so <HI>Paterculus</HI> calls it, <HI>ingeniosa Gula,)</HI> could have made with all provisions had from the <HI>Earth,</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI> and <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord Ambassadour observed not that uneasy way of sitting at his meat, but in his own house had <HI>Tables</HI> and <HI>Chayres</HI> &amp;c. served he was altogether in <HI>Plate,</HI> and had an <HI>English,</HI> and an <HI>Indian</HI> Cook to dress his dyer, which was very plentifull, and cheap likewise; so that by reason of the great variety of provisions there, his weekly account for his house-keeping came but to little.</P>
<P>The meaner sort of people there eat <HI>Rice</HI> boyled with their <HI>green-Ginger,</HI> and a little <HI>Pepper,</HI> after which they put Butter into it, which is their principal dish, and but seldom eaten by them: but their ordinary food is made (not of the flowr of wheat▪) but of a course well tasted grain, made up in round broad and thick Cakes, which they bake upon their thin iron plates (before spoken of) which they carry
<PB N="212" REF="121"/>
with them, when as they travell from place to place; when they have bak'd those cakes, they put a little butter on them, and doubtless the poor people find this a very hearty food▪ for they who live most upon it, are as strong as they could be, if they had their diet out of the Kings Kitchin. I shall here say no more of this, but proceed to speak</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Civilities of this people; Of their Complements, and of their Habits.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AND here the people in general (as be∣fore was observed) are as civil to stran∣gers, as to their own Countrey-men; for they use when they meet one another, or when they meet strangers, to bow their heads, or to lay their right hands on their brests, and to bow their bodyes as they pass, saluting them fur∣ther with many well-wishes.</P>
<P>They use not to uncover their heads at all, as we do in our salutes, (from which custom of ours, the <HI>Turks</HI> borrow this imprecation for their enemies, wishing their souls no more rest after death than a Christians hat hath, which
<PB N="213" REF="121"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s alwayes stirred) but the meaner sort, instead of uncovering their heads to their superiours use these abject ceremonies, by putting their right hand to the earth, and then laying it on their head, or by falling down on their knees; and then bowing their heads to the earth, both sig∣nifying, that those unto whom they shew these reverences, and respects, may tread or trample on them, if they pleased.</P>
<P>When we visite the <HI>people</HI> there, of better <HI>quality,</HI> they entertain us with much humani∣ty, first rising up to us, they bow their bodyes, and then intreat us to sit with them on their Carpets, where they are free in their discourse, which we usually exchange with them by an Interpreter. If we have any business with them, they return very civill and fair answers, and for our further entertainment give us <HI>Beetle</HI> or <HI>Paune</HI> to chew (before spoken of)</P>
<P>In their neer, and more close and hearty Sa∣lutes, they do not joyn hands as we, but do that which is hatefull to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and not at all in use with us; for they take one another by the Chin, or Beard, and cry. <HI>Bobba,</HI> which is Father, or <HI>Bij,</HI> which is Brother: and this ap∣peares to be a very ancient Complement, for thus <HI>Joab</HI> long ago saluted <HI>Amasa,</HI> 2 Sam. 20. 9 but this they do in love, not as <HI>Joab</HI> did there, in treacherie.</P>
<P>In their Complements they express many
<PB N="214" REF="122"/>
good wishes to one another, as <HI>Salam Alla∣cum,</HI> God give you health; the reply, <HI>Alla∣cum Salam,</HI> the same health God give you. And <HI>Greb-a Nemoas,</HI> I wish you the prayers of the poor. And <HI>Tere gree gree kee Bulla doore,</HI> which made English speaks thus, I wish one good to come, unto you after another every <HI>Gra,</HI> (which is a space of time a little more than a quarter of an hour) and they have many more Complements like these, handsom, and significant. As inferiour people (who have their dependance on others) use to say unto them, <HI>I eat your Breat and Salt</HI> (as much to say) I am your servant, I live by you, and you may do <HI>with me,</HI> or <HI>to me,</HI> what you please.</P>
<P>Now as this people of <HI>East India</HI> are Civil in their speeches, so are they Civilly clad, for there are none who weare their own skin alone for their covering, as very many in the Western <HI>India</HI> do.</P>
<P>For the Habites of this people, from the highest to the lowest, they are all made of the same fashion, which they never alter, nor change; their Coats sitting close to their bodyes unto their wasts, then hanging down loose a little below their knees, the lower part of them sit∣ting somewhat full; those close Coats are fast∣ned unto both their shoulders, with slips made of the some cloth, which for the generality, are
<PB N="215" REF="122"/>
all made of courser, or finer white <HI>Callico;</HI> and in like manner are they fastned to their wast, on both sides thereof, which Coats coming double over their brests, are fastned by like slips of cloth, that are put thick from their left arme∣holes to their middle; The sleeves of those coats are made long and somewhat close to their Armes, that they may <HI>ruffle,</HI> especially from their elbowes, to their wrists. Under this Coate they usually weare another sleight one, made of the same cloth, but shorter than the other, and this is all they commonly weare upon the up∣per part of their bodies. But some of the greater sort in the cooler seasons of the day there, will s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip on loose Coats over the other, made either of quilted silk, or <HI>Callico,</HI> or of our English Scarlet Broad-cloth (for that is the colour they most love). Under their Coats they have long <HI>breeches</HI> like unto <HI>Irish-Trouses,</HI> made usually of the same Cloth, which come to their Ankles, and <HI>ruffle</HI> on the small of their leggs. For their feet they keep them (as was before observed) alwayes bare in their shooes.</P>
<P>Some of their <HI>Grandees</HI> make their Coats and Breeches of striped <HI>Taffata</HI> of several co∣lours, or of some other silk stuff all of the same colour, or of slight cloth of <HI>Silver</HI> or <HI>Gold,</HI> all made in that Countrey. But pure white and fine <HI>Callico-Laune,</HI> (which they there make like∣wise) is for the most part the height of all their
<PB N="216" REF="123"/>
bravery; the collars, and some other parts of their upper coats, being set off with some neat stitching.</P>
<P>Upon their heads they weare a long wreath of cloth, about half a yard broad, usually white, but sometimes of other colours. Which cloth worn for their head covering, is sometimes in∣ter-woven in spaces with <HI>threds</HI> of coloured <HI>silk,</HI> or <HI>silver,</HI> or <HI>gold,</HI> and when not so, one end of that wreath of cloth worn by <HI>Gallants</HI> is usual∣ly thus interwoven, and so put upon their heads, that its gayness may appear. This head-cove∣ring of theirs, they call a <HI>Shash,</HI> which incircles their heads many times, and doth mervailously defend them from the violence of the Sun. And because this covering must needs keep their heads hot▪ they provide for this, as well as they can, by shaving the haire continually from off them. And they have <HI>girdles</HI> made of the same <HI>wreaths</HI> of cloth for the better sort, thus <HI>interwoven▪</HI> which come twice at least about them, made very trim with that kinde of wea∣ving, especially on both ends, which hangdown directly before them.</P>
<P>And thus have I presented a <HI>Mahometan</HI> there in his proper dress, whose habit will more visibly appear together in the <HI>Mogols</HI> Picture, portrayed and after put into this discourse.</P>
<P>Now for the <HI>Mahometan▪</HI> women; (because I had never sight of those of the greatest quali∣quality)
<PB N="217" REF="123"/>
I cannot give such an account of them in respect of the Habits; for these, unless they be dishonest, or poor, come not abroad; but for the fashion of their garments, they do not differ much from those the men weare, for they weare Coats, and Breeches one very like the other, onely women bind their long haire with <HI>Philets,</HI> which hang down behind them. They wear likewise upon their heads <HI>Mantles</HI> or <HI>Vailes</HI> (usually made of white <HI>Callico,</HI> or of their <HI>Pintadoes)</HI> which hang down over their other garments. Further, the women have their <HI>Eares</HI> boared, not only in their flapps, but round about them, wherein they weare very little <HI>Pendants;</HI> those of the richer sort are made of flat, narrow and thin peeces of <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Sil∣ver;</HI> those worn by the poorer sort made of <HI>Brass,</HI> or <HI>Iron</HI> kept bright, so that all are in the same fashion; they bestow some work upon the edges and ends of those <HI>Pendants.</HI> And those women have the lower part of their left <HI>nostrils</HI> pierced, wherein they weare a <HI>Ring</HI> (when they please) of <HI>Gold,</HI> or <HI>Silver,</HI> or of some o∣ther baser metals. Those Rings of Gold have little <HI>pearles</HI> fastned to one end of them▪ and that <HI>Pearle</HI> is dril'd through, that both ends of the ring may meet in it. And doubtless, the wo∣men of the greatest quality, (though I saw it not) are bedeck't with many rich <HI>Jewels.</HI> This I have observed in some of those of the better sort I there saw, that they did wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e great
<PB N="218" REF="124"/>
broad <HI>Hollow Rings of Gold</HI> enamel'd; and some made of Silver, or Brass, upon their wrists, and upon the small of their leggs, to take off and on; two or three of them upon each Arm, and Leg, which make a tinkling noyse, very probably such Ornaments as the Jewish women were threatned for, <HI>Esaiah</HI> 3. where Al∣mighty God tells them, <HI>that he would take a∣way their tinkling Ornaments about their feet, the Bracelets, and the Ornaments of their leggs, their Rings, and Nos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>For my Lord Ambassadour, and his Compa∣ny, we all kept to our English Habits, made as light and coole as possibly we could have them. His wayters in <HI>Red Taffata</HI> Cloakes guarded with green Taffata, which they alwayes wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e when they went abroad with him, my self in a long black Cassock; and the Colours and fa∣shion of our garments were so different from theirs, that we needed not, wheresoever we were, to invite spectators to take notice of us.</P>
<P>And now, the Constancy there observed by the Natives of both sexes, in keeping to their old fashions in their habits, exampled to them by their predecessors in many foregoing Gene∣rations, and by them still continued, is the great prayse of this people, as the Commendation of every Nation in the world almost, besides ours, still constant to their ancient fashions in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r apparell.</P>
<P>The consideration of this might <HI>shame,</HI> and
<PB N="219" REF="124"/>
make us to blush at it (if we were a people whom shame in this case could take) shame I say, and condemn too, the lightnes, and wan∣tonnes, the want of sobermindedness, and in∣constancy of our people here in this case, who most justly deserve, even for this very thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be made <HI>Bare</HI> and <HI>Naked,</HI> because they are ne∣ver long pleased, scarce at all contented, with the fashion of that they weare for their cove∣ring, continually varying and multiplying their vanities, expressed by their habits. So that what the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> 5. 5. speaks of <HI>Israel,</HI> may be applyed to <HI>England</HI> that the pride thereof doth testifie to its face.</P>
<P>It is an Observation in <HI>Heraldry,</HI> that the richer the <HI>Coate</HI> is, the fewer are the <HI>Colours</HI> in it. But whatsoever many Gallants of these times bear in their <HI>Scutcheons,</HI> I am sure they want no colours in their cloathing, as if they were created <HI>Knights</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and engaged to wear about them every <HI>Colour</HI> in the <HI>Rain∣bow.</HI></P>
<P>Unto what a shamefull &amp; unjustifiable length is the Haire of very many grown to, fitter to be measured by a Carpenters Rule, than by a Combe, when mens haire hangs about their shoulders like Manes on the necks of Horses. A wild &amp; strange fashion never taken up till these rylate times (almost in the memory of Chil∣dren) which puts such strange disguises upon
<PB N="220" REF="125"/>
many, that when it first took its rise here in this Nation, if then a man had met a few of them (who now thus bury, and loose their heads in their haire) he would have then con∣ceived that he had met with <HI>Furies,</HI> rather than <HI>men.</HI> Since which time that evill custome hath so prevailed amongst us, as if the commonness thereof, were a sufficient excuse for its unde∣cency.</P>
<P>And (by the way) I should be exceeding glad, if I could exempt and wholy separate from their Company, all those whose business it is to be the <HI>teachers</HI> and <HI>instructers</HI> of others, yet in this particular deserve that blame which gives very much offence unto many of those who are sober, minded. <HI>Thou which teachest another, teachest thou not thy self?</HI> saith the Apo∣stle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 21. the very coal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of which Scrip∣ture burns out against them, who do not labour to live up unto every rule they prescribe to o∣thers, who dare without blushing to do that themselves, which they are bound to reproove in others.</P>
<P>If these would but consider, how much gra∣vity there is required in a <HI>Minister of the Go∣spel,</HI> and look but a little with other mens eyes, they would presently see a long haire (I had al∣most said a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agpoule) to become a Pulpit so ill, that they would never presume to ascend that place again in that shamefull disguise.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="125"/>
I might hereunto add the many <HI>trickings</HI> and <HI>trimmings</HI> of some likewise which appear in that place, very much unbecomming the gra∣vity of their profession; In which respect, the de∣cency and comeliness which hath appeared in others, in those particulars I named, may be a strongwitness against them; in others, who have been thought fit to be removed from their places, and to be thereby layd aside; In others, who have made room for those, either by their death, or otherwise. Now those great undecen∣cies (as I apprehend them) are faults, whatso∣ever is said in their justification, which, as for∣mer times could not paralel them, so the times present cannot excuse them.</P>
<P>But for others whom before I named, rather than they will not come up unto this height of vanitie, they make the haire of Women, which before was dead, to live again (as it were) upon their heads. Concerning whom, if you put that question in the Prophet Jeremy 18. 13. <HI>and ask among the Heathen, who hath heard or done such things?</HI> It will be answered, none there, none of them; yet this unnatural sin makes ma∣ny amongst us, even to pride themselves in this their shame. <HI>For doth not Nature it self teach, that if a man wear long haire, it is a shame un∣to him,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 14.</P>
<P>And for the other Sex amongst us, they are so carryed on by the <HI>foot of Pride,</HI> as they come
<PB N="222" REF="126"/>
never a whit behind, of whom there are too too many, when God hath bestowned upon them a very large portion of outward <HI>feature,</HI> and <HI>beauty,</HI> more than upon many others, it is ve∣ry strange, that those, not yet content with his most excellent workmanship, should go about to amend it, as they think, by spending many precious houres to varnish a little <HI>Rottenness, spotting</HI> and <HI>painting</HI> themselves, as if <HI>beauty</HI> could be increased by <HI>deformities,</HI> thus presen∣ting themselves to the view of others, as if they had received many <HI>skarres</HI> and <HI>wounds,</HI> &amp;c. so they have by <HI>the rod of pride</HI> (to take those words in a borrowed sense) which they cover with their black patches.</P>
<P>For outward <HI>beauty,</HI> without doubt it is an excellent gift of God, and so to be esteemed; but when the <HI>Soul</HI> answers not the <HI>face,</HI> in not being beautifull like it, it leads to a Curse. And experience teacheth us, that many of the <HI>foulest</HI> Souls in this respect dwell <HI>fairest.</HI> There are no two things help to people Hell more, than <HI>wanton witts</HI> and <HI>beautifull faces;</HI> that <HI>beauty</HI> therefore is worse than any <HI>deformity,</HI> when it abuseth the <HI>Soul;</HI> when the <HI>Soul</HI> is made <HI>worse</HI> by it in making the party on whom it is bestowed, either <HI>proud</HI> or <HI>filthy.</HI></P>
<P>In the one and thirtieth of the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> 3. 14. a woman is compared to a <HI>Merchants ship,</HI> which as it is there spoken of a <HI>good</HI> wo∣man,
<PB N="223" REF="126"/>
so it may be applyed to a <HI>bad</HI> one like∣wise, that she is like a ship, alwayes ready for <HI>trade,</HI> and therefore setts off herself as much as possibly she can with all variety of <HI>rigging.</HI> And further, concerning both Sexes in this case, I shall borrow something from another to speak of them, which I long since observed in these following verses, but a little varied.</P>
<Q><L>Our women here in Gauds excell,</L>
<L>And in their loose attires do swell</L>
<L>More light then sailes when fresh gales play:</L>
<L>Yet are our men more loose than they,</L>
<L>More Kemb'd &amp; poudred, Rub'd &amp; trim'd,</L>
<L>More bath'd, &amp; sleek'd, &amp; slacker limm'd;</L>
<L>Grown so, effeminate in their Mind.</L>
<L>As if resolv'd to loose their kind.</L>
<L>Both swell in plenty, wealth, and Ease,</L>
<L>And health abus'd, made their disease.</L></Q>
<P>Now much of all this proceeds from <HI>Fashi∣ons,</HI> one fashion bringing in another, and the fa∣shion must bear out, and excuse all; This <HI>Fa∣shion</HI> [as it should seeme] is the best <HI>Preacher</HI> and <HI>Oratour</HI> in our Nation. It were well if our <HI>preachings, exhortations,</HI> and <HI>reproofs</HI> were in <HI>fashion</HI> too, for then I am sure they would gain a great party, win a great many both men and women unto them, that now of all things can∣not abide them; for they leave these, and still <HI>fashion themselves after the world,</HI> in every
<PB N="224" REF="127"/>
Garish devise, disguise, and dress; or rather af∣ter the Devill himself, for they are <HI>Satanae inge∣nia,</HI> as <HI>[Tertullian</HI> calls them] inventions of the Divell, and not of men. And both may just∣ly fear, that when Almighty God shall come <HI>to judge the quick, and dead,</HI> he may not own these, who have so deformed that simple fa∣shion, in which he first Created them, but may say as <HI>Cyprian</HI> observes, <HI>Opus hoc meum non est, haec mea non est imago,</HI> This is not my workmanship, nor this the similitude I first made. When God shall say otherwise of their Garments, then <HI>Jacob</HI> sometimes did of <HI>Josephs, Genes. 37. 33. Haec non est tunica silii mei,</HI> This is not my Sons Coate. When <HI>their own clothes,</HI> [to take that of <HI>Job</HI> in a literal sense] Job. 9. 33. <HI>shall make them to be abhorred.</HI></P>
<P>Little do these consider, that Almighty God can give them a <HI>rent, instead of a Garment,</HI> and and can cover them with <HI>Leprosie,</HI> instead of <HI>Clothing;</HI> that when he pleaseth, he can put a vizard upon their faces, and can strike as well the daughters of <HI>England,</HI> as those of <HI>Sion,</HI> with a <HI>scab Es.</HI> 3. 17. And cover them with <HI>blackness</HI> and deformity, instead of <HI>beauty.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon [good Reader] my length and lan∣guage in this digression, for I am not <HI>bitter,</HI> but <HI>Charitable. Infector vitia, non homines.</HI> They are the vices and vanities of people, not their persons I reproove.

<P>I cannot like to praise ildle Pamphlets, nor yet honour and esteem vain persons, whatsoever their outsides be. It is a mark, amongst others, of a good man, that he is one <HI>in whose eyes a vile person is contemned,</HI> Num. 15. 4. in whose eyes, or before whom, and in whose judgment, a vile person [whatsoever he may otherwise be] who makes himself vile by his irregular course, and carriage, is contemned, or little or nothing set by, or regarded.</P>
<P>They were wont to cry out against the <HI>Court,</HI> for bringing forth and nursing up many strange and new <HI>Fashions.</HI> Now in respect of this, the whole Nation is an enlarged dissipated <HI>Court;</HI> and the great City in it, as it shares very much in this National sin, so it must bear a very great part of blame for this, and if, even for this very thing, it escape a, signal judg∣ment, it will fare much better than it de∣serves.</P>
<P>When <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperour some∣times rode in Triumph through <HI>Rome,</HI> and then observed the state and bravery of that City, he said, <HI>se tot vidisse Reges, quot Ci∣ves,</HI> that he beheld as many Kings, as Citi∣zens: the like may be said of our great Ci∣ty <HI>London,</HI> wherein a very great number appear, by reason of their strange excess
<PB N="226" REF="128"/>
in apparell, <HI>Princes,</HI> and <HI>Princesses!</HI> rather than <HI>Citizens.</HI></P>
<P>Which varied and multiplyed Pride in Clothing there, took a very great Rise in that greatest visitation by the <HI>plague</HI> of <HI>Pe∣stilence</HI> that ever that City felt, in the year 1625. When very many of that populous City left their houses, and shops, and went into the countrey, putting themselves, and wives into the dresses then in fashion (a thing never done by them before) which were worn by the Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen of the best rank, and e∣ver since have kept in, if not exceeded them in their Habits. A sad use made of such an extraordinary judgment. And ever since, he that strictly viewes that place, may observe a great contest twixt <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> for the upper end of the <HI>Table.</HI> Be∣fore which time, none but the <HI>princi∣pal sort</HI> of women there were clothed in silks; now very many even ordinary <HI>ser∣vants</HI> are thus <HI>clad.</HI> That City then began to lead the way into this bravery; since (evill examples being easily imitated) all the populous places in this Nation follow them. So that we may take up a general Lamentation against the pride of this whole Nation, but of that City in a more special

<P>I cannot deny but that things which are <HI>rich,</HI> and of the greatest <HI>value</HI> that are <HI>made,</HI> may be <HI>worn,</HI> yet doubtless this is a truth too, that all who can finde money to pay for them, are not fit to wear them. For (as it is well distinguished) there is, <HI>necessi∣tas Naturae &amp; personae.</HI> The bodyes of all re∣quire covering, to defend them from cold, and mean <HI>cloth</HI> may warm as well as a rich <HI>Plush:</HI> yet such as are of high <HI>Birth,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI> are fit to wear rich garments, which will not become others, the consideration of their persons gives them liberty herein, which it doth not to other people, who would finde much more comfort in <HI>frieze,</HI> or <HI>cloth,</HI> or <HI>stuff,</HI> then in <HI>velvet,</HI> or in any other <HI>Rich thing</HI> infected by the <HI>pride</HI> or <HI>fashion</HI> of those that wear them, whosoever they be.</P>
<P>But here I might borrow the words of the, Prophet and cry, <HI>How is our silver be∣come

<P>When the rude <HI>Souldiers</HI> saw the <HI>Sena∣tors</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> sit gravely, and demeaning themselves as became their places, they held them to be <HI>Gods;</HI> but as soon as they dis∣covered the <HI>failings</HI> and <HI>passions</HI> of men, they presently took them to be <HI>men</HI> &amp; <HI>des∣pised</HI> and <HI>spoiled</HI> them. It will be thus with all men of <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>birth,</HI> and <HI>place,</HI> while they do things becoming themselves, in expressing <HI>Noblenes,</HI> and <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>vertue</HI> in their lives &amp; courses, they cannot choose but be highly esteemed; but if they discover in themselves the <HI>passions,</HI> the <HI>pride,</HI> the <HI>vanitie</HI> and <HI>vilenes</HI> that is in the worser sort of people, if they make themselves. <HI>Cheap,</HI> they will grow into <HI>contempt;</HI> as the horrid vices of <HI>Tiberius</HI> the Emperour, made him

to be hated even of his greatest flatte∣rers.</P>
<P>A good heart knowes not how to reve∣rence, and put an high esteem upon any thing it observes in man besides, <HI>Gods Image;</HI> and when that appeares not, but the contrary, mens tongues and penns will make bold with the greatest.</P>
<P>But why do I spend so much <HI>time,</HI> and <HI>ink,</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> in such a seeming <HI>impertinent, unplausible,</HI> and <HI>unprofitable</HI> reproof? for though that which I have named be such a fault in this Nation, as no language can ever excuse, and no time, I fear, will re∣form; because the people of this Land by a long custome, and continuance, do chal∣lenge such a propriety in new fashions, are so habituated to them, that in probability nothing which can fall, either from the tongues, or penns of men shall ever be able to reform it.</P>
<P>Yet before I leave this just reproof, I shall add a few words more, for those that invent, and urge arguments in the defence thereof; as first, some say that these new in∣vented things, which multiply fashions, serve to keep, and maintain many poor people in work: To these I answer, as it was spoken of <HI>Judas,</HI> when he grumbled at the expence
<PB N="230" REF="130"/>
of that <HI>oynment</HI> bestowed on our Blessed <HI>Saviour,</HI> John 12. 5. 6. saying, <HI>This might have been sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor;</HI> but this he said (saith the text) <HI>not that he cared for the poor,</HI> &amp;c. So, this some speak, not that they love the poor, but the fashion; which poor doubtless might finde as comfortable a subsistence, if they were not thus imployed. And Secondly, whereas others pretend, and say that their hearts may be good and humble, whatsoever their habits be, I dare conclude, that it is as impossible for a <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>humble,</HI> and <HI>mo∣dest heart</HI> to dwell under a vain and fanta∣stick habit, as for <HI>evill</HI> to be <HI>good.</HI></P>
<P>I know that it is a very strange Case which can finde no Advocate; A <HI>poysoned pill</HI> may be gilded over, as well as that which is wholesome. <HI>Favorinus</HI> long agoe wrote in the Commendation of a <HI>Quartan Ague.</HI> That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul and filthy disease, hath not wan∣ted a pen to excuse, and commend it. <HI>Fools, saith Salomon, make a mock at sin.</HI> Prov. 14. 9. Others have made a very <HI>bad wife</HI> the subject of their <HI>Commendation,</HI> because (they say) she brings a man to <HI>repentance.</HI> What is it not that the Luxuriancy and ranknes of wit cannot put a varnish on? when men, like the silly Fly, play with fire
<PB N="231" REF="130"/>
till they sindge their wings, and fall into it. Let me speak therefore as a Divine to all those which plead for new fashions, and therefore think they may be, because they are generally taken up, and followed. That sinns are by so much the greater, by how much they are more general and universal, and that sin is so far from being extenua∣ted by the multitude of offenders, which live under the guilt thereof, that nothing can more aggravate it.</P>
<P>With men, commoness pleads for favour; with God, it pleads for judgment; the <HI>Le∣prosie</HI> of the whole body being by far more loathsome, then that which appears but in a part thereof; and so much of this, I will now proceed to take notice of other par∣ticulars, which follow in this relation, As,</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their Language, their Books, their Learning, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Language</HI> of this Empire, I mean the Vulgar, bears the name of it, and is called <HI>Indostan;</HI> it hath much affinitie with the <HI>Persian,</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> tongues, but the <HI>Indostan</HI> is a smoother language, and more easy to be pronounced than the other, a language which is very significant, and speaks much in few words; They write it (as we) to the right hand. It is expressed by letters, which are very much different from those <HI>Alphabets,</HI> by which the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> tongues are formed. The <HI>Per∣sian</HI> there is spoken as their more quaint and Court-tongue. The <HI>Arabian</HI> is their learned language, both written backward to the left hand like the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> from whence they borrow many words, which come so neer it, as that he who is a good <HI>Critick</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> may very well guess at the meaning of much in both those languages. The <HI>Persian</HI> is a language, as if it consisted all of <HI>Guttur all letters,</HI> (as some
<PB N="233" REF="131"/>
in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Alphabet are called) filling the mouth in the Pronunciation of them; for as the words in that language are full of <HI>sense:</HI> so in their speaking they are full of <HI>sound.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> by which there hath been so much knowledge conveyed in∣to the world, they are as ignorant of them both, as if they had never been; and this may be one great reason why there is so little learning amongst them. But for the people themselves, they are men of very strong reason, and will speak <HI>ex re natâ,</HI> upon any offered occasion, very exceeding well; and doubtless they are a people of such strong Capacities, that were there litera∣ture amongst them, they might be the <HI>Au∣thors</HI> of many excellent <HI>works;</HI> but as the case stands with them, all that is there at∣tainable towards learning, is but to read and write.</P>
<P>And here by the way let me insert this, that I never saw any <HI>Idiot</HI> or natural <HI>Fool,</HI> nor any <HI>deformed</HI> person amongst them, in any of those parts.</P>
<P>For <HI>Logick</HI> and <HI>Rhetorick</HI> which are so instrumental, the first to enlarge, and the second to polish discourses, they have none but what is <HI>Natural.</HI> They say, that they
<PB N="234" REF="132"/>
write some witty <HI>Poems,</HI> and compose ma∣ny handsome <HI>Annals</HI> and <HI>Stories</HI> of their own, and other adjacent Countreys.</P>
<P>They delight much in <HI>Musick,</HI> and have some stringed, but many more winde Instru∣ments; They have the use of <HI>Timbrils</HI> like∣wise; but for want of pleasing <HI>Airs,</HI> their <HI>Musick</HI> in my ears never seemed to be any thing but <HI>discord.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Books</HI> are not many, and those are <HI>Manuscripts.</HI> That rare and happie in∣vention of <HI>Printing,</HI> which hath been the advancement of so much learning within <HI>Christendom,</HI> is not known <HI>without</HI> it.</P>
<P>They have heard of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> whom they call <HI>Aplis,</HI> and have some of his books (as they say) in the <HI>Arabian</HI> tongue, in which language (they further say) they have ma∣ny books written by <HI>Avicenna,</HI> that anci∣ent Physician, who was born in <HI>Samar∣chandia,</HI> one of the most fam'd places within the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Empire, the Countrey (as they believe) where <HI>Tamberlain,</HI> the <HI>Mo∣gols</HI> great Ancestor, drew his first breath.</P>
<P>Some parts or fragments they have of the old <HI>Testament;</HI> of which more, when I shall come to speak of their Religion.</P>
<P>Many amongst them profess themselves to have great skill in judicial. <HI>Astrologie,</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="132"/>
that great <HI>Cheat,</HI> which hath been very an∣ciently, and often put upon (as the Sacred Storie witnesseth) the people inhabiting the <HI>East,</HI> and <HI>South</HI> parts of the world. I call it a <HI>Cheat,</HI> because there is, and must needs be, so much uncertainty in it, all things here below being ordered, and overruled, by the secret, and unerring pro∣vidence of Almighty God, <HI>which frustra∣teth the tokens of the Lyars, and maketh Diviners mad, that turneth wise men back∣ward, and maketh their knowledge foolish,</HI> Esay 44. 25. First, these Diviners are <HI>mad</HI> when things fall not out according to their bold predictions; And secondly, they have been, and not without cause, esteemed as <HI>mad-men,</HI> in foretelling things which they could not know, and much less bring to pass.</P>
<P>And therefore I have heard a great Ma∣ster in, and a publick Professor of <HI>Astrono∣mie,</HI> who could see as far into <HI>Constellations</HI> and observe as much from them as, any o∣ther, often say, that he would go by the ve∣ry selfesame rules that others did, to pre∣dict things to come, and would write that which was quite contrary to what they ob∣served, yet what he wrote should as often fall to be as true as what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>old.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="133"/>
Yet notwithstanding the truth of these premises, the great <HI>Mogol</HI> puts so much confidence in his <HI>Astrologers,</HI> that he will not undertake a journey, nor yet resolve to do any thing besides of the least conse∣quence, unless his <HI>wizards</HI> tell him it is a good and a prosperous hour, to begin, and set upon such an undertaking, and at the ve∣ry instant he hath his directions from them▪ he sets upon the thing he undertakes, and not before.</P>
<P>It is strange to consider what <HI>ignorance</HI> or <HI>despair</HI> in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>case may not put men <HI>upon,</HI> may not put men <HI>into: ignorance</HI> in that <HI>King</HI> thus besotted with an high opi∣nion of his <HI>Astrologers.</HI> So <HI>despair</HI> in <HI>Saul</HI> another King long before him, who after he had lost the favour of God grew despe∣rate, and resolved that if God would not answer him, Sathan should. And therefore he said in his distress unto his servants, 1 <HI>Sam. 28. 7. Seek me out one that hath a familiar spirit.</HI> The condition of <HI>Saul</HI> was at this time exceeding sad, as appears by his complaint, v. 15. <HI>The Philistins make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more either by Pro∣phets, or Dreams, and what shall I do?</HI> I confess that the loss of God is the greatest
<PB N="237" REF="133"/>
of all losses. For, as his <HI>favour</HI> to a believing Soul, in the want of every thing besides, is <HI>enough, because his loving kindnes is better than life it self)</HI> Psal. 63. 3. So, the <HI>gaining</HI> of every thing the world can afford with the <HI>loss of Gods Countenance,</HI> makes <HI>profit loss, a Chaire of State uneasy,</HI> an heredita∣ry, (and much more) a usurped Scepter so unweildy, as that it cannot be managed with comfort.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Saul,</HI> a King, is so perplexed in his thoughts, when as Almighty God <HI>had taken his loving kindnes from him,</HI> that he asks the question, what shall I do? Not what thou did'st (wretched <HI>Saul)</HI> against the streame of thine own Conscience, to seek unto those whom thou had'st but of late condemned, and punished, to take a course which thou knowest to be divellish. Mise∣rable <HI>Saul,</HI> how couldst thou hope to find God at thy Command, that wouldst not be at His! How couldst thou look that God should regard thy voyce in trouble, that wouldst not regard his in Peace? <HI>Saul</HI> had now forfetted Gods favour, and God takes the forfeture; and there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore it was not to be wondred at, that he walked so irregu∣larly, when he had put himself out of Gods Protection.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="134"/>
Thus before <HI>(Numb.</HI> 22.) when all help failed <HI>Moab,</HI> the Magician was sought unto. If there be any one Project worse than another, a wicked heart will finde that out; though it be a sign of a most des∣perate cause, when Sathan is made either a mans Counsellor or Refuge.</P>
<P>What men may do by the help of Astro∣logie, and do it safely and without sin, de∣serves Commendation, not blame, nor Cen∣sure. But certainly to conclude of future events, is above Art or, Man; because those things Almighty God hath lockt up among his secrets, far above all reach, or search. Nay, the most intelligent Spirits know no∣thing of future Events; or could those evill Spirits truly foretell things to come no way pre-existent, they could not without great danger and sin be consulted withall; for the evill of their Nature debarrs all the benefit that can come by their information; for they never do a man an apparent good one way, but they do him a Real mischief another.</P>
<P>The Devill (as we may conceive) knows things past, and as he animates and encou∣rages a man to theft by his suggestions, tel∣ling him, that he is poor, and must live, and therefore may steal; that if he cannot sup∣port
<PB N="239" REF="134"/>
himself by warrantable, he must live, and therefore may take other courses. Now that Devill which courts a man to Theft, can certainly tell what he steales, and there∣fore can discover goods stol'n: wherein the Devill makes a double advantage unto him∣self; first, in making the Thief his own, and secondly, the other, who leaves God, and repaires to him in his instruments for a discovery of goods thus stoln.</P>
<P>Now for a <HI>Mahometan</HI> who lives in the dark to consult <HI>Southsayers,</HI> and <HI>Wizards,</HI> it is no great marvell, because his igno∣rance of God puts him upon those mad shifts and conceits to have recourse unto Sathan: But for such as profess themselves Christians, who live under that cleer light, which strictly forbids all such courses; for these in their losses to repaire unto cun∣ning men, and women (as they call them) who cannot possibly help them, but by some secret <HI>compact with the Devill,</HI> is certainly a very grievous sin, an undertaking most horribly impious. So then, they whosoever they be who to find out their stoll'n goods, hazard the loss of their Souls, however they speed shall gain nothing by that en∣quiry.</P>
<P>Yet this hath been a sin very ancient in
<PB N="240" REF="135"/>
the world, and undertaken for more ends, than I have named. When</P>
<P><HI>Filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos.</HI> The naughty Children, of as bad Parents, have sought out to have the <HI>Nativity</HI> of their <HI>Fa∣thers Calculated,</HI> that they might be told (if such a thing could be discovered) how long they had to live, thinking every minute a month till they see them kneeling in <HI>Brass,</HI> or <HI>stone,</HI> or more <HI>cheaply buried;</HI> that so they might be setting that abroach with <HI>profuse Lu∣xury</HI> which their parents had been long bar∣relling up with <HI>great Avarice.</HI> It falling out many times by the righteous judgment of Al∣mighty God, that when wickedness <HI>getts,</HI> wic∣kedness shall <HI>consume</HI> that estate so <HI>gotten;</HI> ac∣cording to that in the Prophet <HI>Micha. 1. 7.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their Physicians, Diseases, Cures. When they begin their year. How they measure their time, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEre are those which pretend unto much skill in Physick, though (for ought I could ever there observe) the people make but little use of them, they fearing more <HI>Medicum quam Morbum;</HI> and therefore do believe the Physician to be the more dangerous dis∣ease.</P>
<P>The common diseases of that Countrey are <HI>bloody fluxes,</HI> with others that come not to blood, hot-<HI>Feavers, Calentures,</HI> which ceise on and fire the head and brain, more than o∣ther parts. These, many times put our men at Sea into very high distempers, especially while they are under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> which makes the poor creatures visited with them, sometimes to conceit the spacious Sea and Waves therein to be great <HI>Fields</HI> full of <HI>Heycocks;</HI> and if they were not sometimes happily prevented, would leap over-board to tumble in them.</P>
<P>For ordinary <HI>Agues,</HI> such as are so common among us, and for those two torments rather
<PB N="242" REF="136"/>
than diseases (when they are selt in extremity) the <HI>Gout</HI> and the <HI>Stone,</HI> they have the happiness to be ignorant of them.</P>
<P>But sometimes they are visited with an <HI>in∣flamation, or an extreme burning,</HI> such as is spoken of, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 22. or rather with a most grievous <HI>Pestilence,</HI> which on a sudden sweeps away many thousands when it comes into great Populous Cities. This <HI>Pestilence</HI> makes the bo∣dyes of men there which are visited with it, like an house, which on a sudden is covered all over wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h fire at once. The City <HI>Amadavar</HI> (at our being there with the <HI>King)</HI> was visited with this Pestilence, in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> and our fa∣mily was not exempted from that most incom∣fortable visitation, for within the space of nine dayes, seven persons that were <HI>English</HI> of our family were taken away by it, and none of those which dyed lay sick above twenty houres, and the major part well, and sick, and dead in twelve houres. As our <HI>Surgeon</HI> (who was there all the Physician we had) and he led the way, falling, sick at <HI>Mid-day,</HI> and the fol∣lowing <HI>Mid-night</HI> dead. And there were three more that followed him, one immediatly after the other, who made as much hast to the grave as he had done, and the rest went after them; within that space of time (I named before.) And (as before I observed) all those that died in our family, of this pestilence, had their bo∣dyes
<PB N="243" REF="136"/>
set all on fire by it, so soon as they were first visited; and when they were dying, and dead, broad spots of a black and blew colour appeared on their brests; and their flesh was made so extreme hot by their most high distem∣per, that we who survived, could scarce endure to keep our hands upon it.</P>
<P>It was a most sad time, a <HI>siery trial</HI> indeed. But such is the goodnes of Almighty God, that he makes the miseries of men here, <HI>Aut tolera∣biles, aut breves,</HI> either sufferable, or short; so that if the thing imposed be extreme heavy to be born, it continues not long, as this most grie∣vous visitation; most violent for the time, like a mighty storm, and then blown away. For here the mercy of God suddenly <HI>stept in, betwixt the living and the dead;</HI> so that not only in our family, but also in that great City, the Plague was stayed.</P>
<P>All our <HI>family</HI> [my Lord Ambassadour only excepted] were visited with this sickness; and we all, who through Gods help and goodnes outlived it, had many great blisters, fild with a thick yellow watry substance, that arose upon many parts of our bodyes, which when they brake, did even <HI>burn</HI> and <HI>corrode</HI> our skins, as it ran down upon them.</P>
<P>For my part, I had a <HI>Calenture</HI> before at <HI>Mandoa,</HI> which brought me even into the ve∣ry <HI>Jawes of Death,</HI> from whence it pleased
<PB N="244" REF="137"/>
God then to rescue and deliver me, which a∣mongst thousands and millions of mercies more received from him, hath, and shall for ever give me cause <HI>to speak good of his Name.</HI></P>
<P>There are very few English which come thi∣ther, but have some violent sicknes, which if they escape, and live temperately, they usually enjoy very much health afterward. But death made many breaches into my Lord <HI>Ambassa∣dors</HI> family, for of <HI>four and twenty</HI> wayters, besides his Secretary and my self, there was not above the fourth man returned home. And he himself by violent Fluxes, was twice brought even to the very brink of the Grave.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>East India,</HI> in all their vio∣lent hot diseases, make very little use of Physi∣cians, unless in be to bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th a veine sometimes, after which they use much fasting as their most hopefull remedy.</P>
<P>That foul disease [a most into consequence of filthy incontinency] is too common in those hot climates, where the people that have it are much more affected with the trouble it brings, than with the sin or shame thereof. As many a∣mongst us, who care not for issue, but lust; and after pay dear for their filthines, which many times rotts, or else makes bare the bones of them that are thus filthy. For as <HI>vertue</HI> and <HI>goodnes rewards it self:</HI> so to it self <HI>wickednes</HI> is a <HI>punishment, poena peccati peccasse:</HI> saith <HI>Seneca,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="137"/>
this is cleer in the sad consequences of many o∣ther sins, <HI>cui <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hu? cui vae?</HI> who hath wo? who hath sorrow? <HI>Solomon</HI> askes the question, and resolves it too, <HI>Prov. 23. 29. they that tarry long at the wine, &amp;c. for it will bite like a Ser∣pent, and sting like an Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</HI> How many sad diseases are contracted to mens bodyes by this kind of intemperancy? who can recount the hurts that by this means come to the whole body, especially to the <HI>Head, Stomack, Liver,</HI> and the more noble párts? who can recite the <HI>Rheumes, Gouts, Dropsies, Appoplexies, In∣flamations,</HI> and other distempers hence arising? Drunkennes being like that Serpent <HI>Amphisbae∣na,</HI> which hath a sting in the <HI>mouth,</HI> and a sting in the <HI>tail,</HI> for it kills two wayes, first the <HI>Body,</HI> and after that the <HI>Soul.</HI></P>
<P>How were the thoughts of <HI>Amnon</HI> rackt a∣bout the compassing of that incestuous, unna∣tural and <HI>brutish lust</HI> with his Sister <HI>Tamar?</HI> for first he is sick for her, and after he had reaped the bitter fruit of his beastly desires, (his lust en∣ding in loathing) he was sick of her, <HI>and hated her exceedingly, and said unto her, arise, be gone,</HI> 2 Sam. 13. 15.</P>
<P><HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Cassius</HI> were traytors which <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> fear'd, <HI>Macilenti &amp; pallidi,</HI> men pal'd with Anger, whose <HI>thoughts</HI> to do mischief, drank up all their own <HI>sap</HI> and <HI>moi∣sture.

of the bones,</HI> Prov. 14. 30. hence the <HI>heart</HI> of the malicious and envious man, is never without <HI>torment,</HI> for it boyles continually, as it were in <HI>Brine;</HI> And therefore this sin is said to have much justice in it self, <HI>Justius invidia ni∣hil est,</HI> because it eateth the heart and marrow of her master, as he desireth to have the heart of another to be eaten up. And thus may it be said of Anger, when it boyles up to rage (as ma∣ny times it doth) <HI>in se s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mper armatur furor,</HI> that it is always in Armes against it self.</P>
<P>The people in <HI>East India</HI> live up to our greatest ages; but without all question they have more old people than we; a thing not to be wondred at▪ if we consider the great Tempe∣rance of that people in general in their eating and drinking.</P>

<P>We lived there some part of our time a little within, or under the <HI>Tropick of Cancer,</HI> and then the Sun was our <HI>Zenith,</HI> or Verticle at noon day directly over our heads, at his return to his Northern bounds. (of which I have spo∣ken something before) The Sun-rising there, was about six houres in the Morning before its appearing here, so that it is twelve of the clock with them, when it is but six with us. We had the Sun there above the <HI>Horizon</HI> in <HI>December,</HI> when the dayes are shortest neer eleven houres, and in▪ <HI>June</HI> when they are at their fullest length, somewhat more than thirteen houres; which long absence of the Sun there from the face of the earth, was very advantagious to cool both the Earth, and Air.

<P>Of the most excellent moralities which are to be observed amongst the People of those Nations.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NExt to those things which are <HI>Spiritually</HI> good, there is nothing which may more challenge a due and deserved commendation, than those things which are <HI>Morally</HI> and <HI>Ma∣terially</HI> so; and many of these may be drawn out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o life, from the examples of great num∣bers amongst that people.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Temperance</HI> of very many, by far the greatest part of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> it is such, as that they will rather choose to dye, like the <HI>Mother</HI> and her <HI>seven Sons</HI> mentioned in the second of <HI>Machabees</HI> and seventh Chap∣ter, then eat or drink any thing their Law for∣bidds them. Or like those <HI>Rechabites,</HI> mentio∣ned Jer. 35. <HI>Where Jonadab their father com∣manded them to drink no wine, and they did for∣bear it for the Commandement sake.</HI> Such meat and drink as their Law allowes them, they take only to satisfie <HI>Nature,</HI> (as before) not, <HI>appetite,</HI> strictly observing <HI>Solomons</HI> Rule, Proy. 23. 2. <HI>in keeping a knife to their throats,</HI> that they may
<PB N="249" REF="139"/>
not transgress in taking too much of the Crea∣ture; hating <HI>Gluttony</HI> and esteeming <HI>drunken∣nes,</HI> as indeed it is, another <HI>Madnes,</HI> and there∣fore have but one word in their language, (though it be very Copious) and that word is <HI>Most,</HI> for a <HI>drunkard,</HI> and a <HI>mad-man.</HI> Which shewes their hatred of drunken distempers; for none of the people there are at any time seen drunk, (though they might find liquor e∣nough to do it, but the very offal and dreggs of that people, and these rarely, or very sel∣dom.</P>
<P>And here I shall insert another most heedfull particular to my present purpose, which de∣serve a most high commendation to be given unto that people in general, how poor and mean soever they be; and that is, the great exemplary care they manifest in their <HI>piety</HI> to their <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> that notwithstanding they serve for very little (as I observed before) but five shillings a <HI>Moon</HI> for their whole livelyhood and subsi∣stence; yet if their Parents be in want, they will impart at the least half of that little to∣wards their necessities, choosing rather to want themselves, then that their Parents should suf∣fer need.</P>
<P>I would have this read, and read over again by many who call themselves Christians, yet most shamefully neglect those loynes from which they fell, looking upon their Pa∣rents,
<PB N="250" REF="140"/>
if they be in need, either with a scorn∣full, or a grudging eye. Whence we have this saying amongst us (which that people would spit at) that one Father and Mother will better provide for ten helpless Children, then so many Children make fitting provision for one poor Father and Mother, as if they were not the Sons and Daughters of men, but rather Chil∣dren of the <HI>Horseleeches,</HI> who are ever Crying, <HI>Give, give,</HI> never returning ought, or any thing proportionable to answer that love and care they have received from their Parents.</P>
<P>It is the Precept of the Apostle, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6. 2. (which is often repeated before in the sacred storie) <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, which is the first Commandement with promise,</HI> with promise of a blessing unto all those who perform that duty as they ought. Now this ho∣nouring of Parents must be expressed by all wayes that manifest Childrens duty, not only in an outward respect and distance, but also in a free release of them, if Children be able, and Parents stand in need.</P>
<P>'Tis well observed, that when <HI>Noah</HI> once <HI>surprized by wine, had layd open his Nakednes in his Tent,</HI> Gen. 9. and by one houres drunken∣ness had discovered that, which more then six hundred years sobriety had modestly concealed, (for drunkennes doth both make imperfecti∣ons, and prefents them thus made to others
<PB N="251" REF="140"/>
eyes) that his Sons <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> out of du∣ty and respect unto their Father, took a garment and went backward, that they might cover, not behold their Fathers nakednes. Which act of Duty and respect unto their Father, was large∣ly repayed unto them in their posterity; whereas <HI>Cham</HI> their brother for his undutifulnes in this case, beares his Fathers curse, and lives under it, and is plagued in his children. We may con∣clude it as a rule, that there have not been any very neglectfull of, or rebelliously undutifull unto their Parents, that have prospered in them∣selves and seed. <HI>Absolon</HI> lifts up his hand a∣gainst his Father <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>his head is after lifted up, and hanged in an Oke, where he dyed miserably.</HI> 2 Sam. 18. I could instance further, if it were the busines of this discourse. But I re∣turn again to the place from whence I am di∣gressed, and must say</P>
<P>Further for this people, (which is not the least commendation of them) they are in gene∣ral a Nation that do never pride it in any new Fashions; for as they are very civilly clad, so I am confident, that they keep to the very selfe same Fashion, that their Ancestors did weare, many hundred yeares agoe (as before I ob∣served)</P>
<P>And certainly if a man should take his jour∣ney <HI>from the rising of the Sun, to the going down of the same,</HI> he should not find a people in all
<PB N="252" REF="141"/>
the world so overrun with an <HI>Itch</HI> after a new fashion, as the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> are, [of which likewise something before.]</P>
<P>For the <HI>Mahometans</HI> [who live much upon the labours of the <HI>Hindooes,</HI> keeping them un∣der, because they formerly conquered them] there are many of them Idle, and know better to eat than work, &amp; these are all for to <HI>morrow,</HI> a word very common in their mouths, and the word is <HI>Sub-ba,</HI> which signifies to <HI>morrow,</HI> and when that day comes, to <HI>morrow,</HI> and so still to <HI>morrow,</HI> they will set down upon their busi∣nesses to <HI>morrow,</HI> will do any thing you would have them to do to <HI>morrow,</HI> they will bestow any thing upon you <HI>Sub-ba,</HI> to morrow. <HI>Pol∣licitis divites,</HI> most rich in promises, in perfor∣mances not so. That being true of many of those <HI>Mahometans,</HI> which <HI>Livie</HI> sometimes spake of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> that he stood most to his pro∣mise, when it was most for his Profit [though to do the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in general right, such as are Merchants and Traders▪ are exact in their dealings] or, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> writes of <HI>Anti∣gonus</HI> the King, who was called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as being ever about to give, but seldome giving. Or as <HI>Martial</HI> of his <HI>Posthumus.</HI></P>

<L>To morrow still thou sayest thou't come to me:</L>
<L>Say Posthumus when will that morrow be.</L></Q>
<P>But for the <HI>Hindooes</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> the an∣cient inhabitants of <HI>East India,</HI> they are a very industrious people very diligent in all the works of their particular callings, believing that <HI>bread sweetest,</HI> and most savoury, which is gain'd by <HI>sweat.</HI> These are for the generality the people that plant and till the ground; These they which make those curious Manifactures that Empire affords; working [as we s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with tooth and nail] imploying their <HI>eares</HI> and <HI>toes,</HI> as well as their <HI>fingers,</HI> to assist them [by holding threds of silke] in the making of some things they worke. These are a people who are not a∣fraid <HI>of a Lion in the way, of a Lion in the streets,</HI> as the slothfull man is, <HI>Prov.</HI> 26. 13. but they lay hold on the present time, the opportunity, to set upon their businesses which they are to do to day, they being very laborious in their several imployments, and very square and exact to make good all their engagements.</P>
<P>Which appeares much in their <HI>Justnes</HI> ma∣nifested unto those that trade with them; for if a man will put it unto their consciences to sell the Commodity he desires to buy at as low a rate as he can afford it, they will deal squarely, and honestly with him; but if in those bargainings a man offer them much less than their set price,
<PB N="254" REF="142"/>
they will be apt to say, what, doest thou think me a <HI>Christian,</HI> that I would go about to <HI>de∣ceive thee?</HI></P>
<P>A salt, a sharp, a biting <HI>Sarcasme,</HI> or rather an horrible truth to be put upon the Score of many who call themselves Christians, yet re∣solve, <HI>quocun{que} Modo Rem,</HI> to get what they can gain, however they get it. It therefore con∣cernes all, and that most highly, who trade in those parts, and are called by that Name, if they will trade for <HI>Heaven</HI> as well as <HI>Commodities</HI> (which if they do not, their returnes will be sad and poor, and all their labour lost) to look a∣bout them, and to be very circumspect, in all their doings and dealings, that the <HI>Name of God &amp; his Doctrine be not blasphemed, and Chri∣stianity</HI> it self made to suffer, by any of their unjustifiable carriages.</P>
<P>I never observe that place, <HI>Gen.</HI> 20▪ 18. where <HI>Abimelech</HI> reprooves <HI>Sarah,</HI> but methinks it is sad for <HI>Sarah, the wife of Abraham, of A∣braham the Father of the Faithfull,</HI> to do that for which she might be reprooved by <HI>Abime∣lech.</HI> It was a shamefull reproof indeed for a woman of her sort to be taught her duty, and upbraided with her faults by an Heathen man. Surely, it cannot but grieve every good heart, to hear that which is too often, and truly spo∣ken, to the shame and reproach of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> that there is more <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fidelity,</HI> more just
<PB N="255" REF="142"/>
<HI>dealing</HI> and <HI>moral honesty,</HI> more <HI>care</HI> of their <HI>word,</HI> more good <HI>neighbourhood</HI> and kindnes, more <HI>Charity</HI> and mercifulnes, among a num∣ber of meer <HI>natural</HI> men, nay, among <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI> than amongst a great many, who are of chief note for the profession of the Go∣spel.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Canaanites</HI> and <HI>Perizzitos</HI> had seen what the Sons of <HI>Jacob, Symion</HI> and <HI>Levi,</HI> had done unto the <HI>Shechemites,</HI> how that they had broken their promise and Covenant with them, how cruelly and barbarously they had us'd them, this made <HI>Jacob</HI> to say (though alas he was far from approoving and consenting to that they did) that <HI>it would make his Religion to stinke among the Inhabitants of the Land.</HI> Gen. 34. 30.</P>
<P>Surely for <HI>Moral Honesty</HI> it is most true, (that even those <HI>Heathens</HI> I have named) mar∣vailously exceed us in it; and Oh! that <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> would be made to blush at the Considera∣tion thereof. <HI>Christians,</HI> that have the Book of God for their direction, where they may run and read their duties, besides that Book of Na∣ture, which is the only guide that people have to walk by; yet that these who live <HI>in darknes and in the shadow of death,</HI> should perform ma∣ny of the strictest things of <HI>the law of bondage,</HI> and Christians who li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> under a <HI>Law of Liber∣ty,</HI> Liberty in and though Christ Jesus, Liberty
<PB N="256" REF="143"/>
(I say) for all those that do not abuse it, should be so blinded with light, that they perform not the things, <HI>no no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>It is a most sad and horrible thing to consider, what scandal there is brought upon the <HI>Chri∣stian Religion,</HI> by the loosenes, and remisnes, by the exorbitances of many, which come a∣mongst them, who profess themselves Chri∣stians, of whom I have often heard the Natives [who live neer the Port where our shipps arrive] say thus, in broken English, which they have gotten, <HI>Christian Religion, Devil Religion, Christian much drunk, Christian much do wrong, much beat, much abuse others.</HI></P>
<P>The unmatcht extremities of Tyranny and Cruelty [to which nothing could be added to make it more cruel] practised by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon the people of <HI>West India,</HI> is above all example, and almost belief. When their bloo∣dy outrages were such, as made those wretched Natives to submit unto any kinde of death, which they would voluntarily impose upon themselves, rather than endure the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Tyranny. <HI>Benzo</HI> in his story of <HI>West India,</HI> writes strange things of them. First, of their cru∣elty, that they destroyed more than twenty Mil∣lions of people amongst them, and then that those <HI>Indians</HI> would say of them, <HI>En Christia∣ne, quid sunt Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp;c.</HI> O Christian, what are Christians? and thus they answered them∣selves
<PB N="257" REF="143"/>
by defining them. Christians are such as thirst after innocent blood, Christians such as desire other mens Lands, other mens Wives, o∣ther mens Gold, and Silver, and would hold out little wedges of Gold, and say, <HI>En Deus Christianorum,</HI> behold the God of the Christi∣stians! They would further add, that the Chri∣stians said, that they were the Children of God, and that after death they went to Heaven, upon which they gave this judgment. <HI>Qualis Deus iste, qui tam impuros &amp; sceleratos filios habet?</HI> What kind of God was the God of the <HI>Christians,</HI> which had such impure and wicked sons? And if he were like them, there could be no goodnes in him. And if those <HI>Christians</HI> went to heaven, they would not desire to go thi∣ther, for they would not be where the <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> were. And thus was the <HI>honour</HI> of God, the <HI>Name</HI> of Christianity, by their most lewd and most cruel behaviour, derided, defamed, re∣proached by those which were <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Pay∣nims.</HI></P>
<P>But to return again unto the people of <HI>East-India,</HI> though the Christians which come a∣mongst them do not such horrible things, yet they do enough to make Christianity it self evill spoken of, as a Religion that deserves more to be abhorred, than imbraced. For truly it is a sad sight there to behold, a <HI>Drunken Christian,</HI> and a <HI>sober Indian;</HI> a temperate <HI>Indian,</HI> and a
<PB N="258" REF="144"/>
<HI>Christian given</HI> up to his <HI>appetite.</HI> An <HI>Indian</HI> that is just and square in his dealing, a Chri∣stian not so, a <HI>Laborious Indian,</HI> and an <HI>Idle Christian,</HI> as if he were borne only to fold his Armes, or <HI>fruges tantum Consumere natus:</HI> to devour <HI>Corne,</HI> and wear out <HI>wooll.</HI> Oh what a sad thing is it for <HI>Christians</HI> to come short of <HI>In∣dians,</HI> even in <HI>Moralities,</HI> to come <HI>short</HI> of <HI>those,</HI> who themselves believe, come <HI>short</HI> of <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Now if any aske whence those <HI>moral</HI> virtues flow that so much adorne <HI>Heathens;</HI> I answer in those words of our <HI>Saviour</HI> spoken to <HI>Peter</HI> in another case, <HI>Mat: 16. 17. that flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto them.</HI> But certainly it proceedes from more then these, and that is, from those <HI>Remnants</HI> &amp; <HI>Remaines,</HI> from those common <HI>impressions</HI> &amp; <HI>norions,</HI> which are sealed up in the <HI>minds</HI> of every one that hath a reaso∣nable <HI>Soule,</HI> a part of <HI>Adams</HI> first integrity be∣fore his fall, a substance or blessing in a tree that seemed to be dead. Little sparkes raked up (as it were) under many ashes, which can never die nor be utterly extinguished so long as the Soule liveth. Hence the Apostle speaks this of the Gen∣tiles, <HI>Ro: 2. 14, 15. that they having not the Law, doe by nature the things conteyned in the law, which shews the works of the law written in their hearts,</HI> &amp;c. But so much be spoken of the Moralities of that people. I come now to take notice</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their Religion, their Priests, their Devotion, their Churches <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ANd now I come to speake of their Religi∣on I shall first take notice of the <HI>Mahome∣tan Religion</HI> there professed. That of the <HI>Hin∣does</HI> or <HI>Heathens</HI> shall finde a place wherein I may speake of it afterwards.</P>
<P>But first of the <HI>Mahometan Religion,</HI> because the great <HI>Mogol</HI> with his <HI>Grandees,</HI> and allother of quality about him are <HI>Mohometans;</HI> which Religion (if it deserve that name) took its first Rise, and began to be professed in the world a∣bout the yeare of <HI>Christ</HI> 620, as hath been ob∣served by many writers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ringleader</HI> to it, and chiefe founder of it was <HI>Mahomet,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> by birth, born (as is said) in a very obscure <HI>place,</HI> and of very meane &amp; low <HI>Parentage,</HI> but a man fill'd with all <HI>subtilty</HI> and <HI>Craft;</HI> who, (as they write) af∣ter that he had much enriched himselfe by wives, came to be the <HI>Commander</HI> of a Com∣pany of <HI>Arabian Volunteers</HI> that followed <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperour in his <HI>Persian</HI> warrs; but not long after himselfe and Soul∣diers, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling first into Mutiny, and after that
<PB N="260" REF="145"/>
to Rebellion, which was an excellent <HI>prepara∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve</HI> to put an innovationor <HI>change</HI> on Religion, and his Souldiers standing close unto him, <HI>he himselfe,</HI> with the help of <HI>Sergiues</HI> a Christian by profession, but an Heretical <HI>Nestorian Monke,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Abdala</HI> a <HI>Jew</HI> composed a Reli∣gion that hath nothing in it, or that savours of nothing so much, as of rude ignorance, and most palpable imposture; it being a <HI>Monster</HI> of many heads; a most damnable <HI>mixture</HI> of horrid <HI>im∣pieties,</HI> if it be considered alltogether.</P>
<P>Yet because it conteins much in it very <HI>plea∣sing</HI> to <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>blood,</HI> and <HI>soothes</HI> up, and <HI>com∣plies</HI> exceedingly with corrupt <HI>nature,</HI> it want∣ed no followers presently to embrace, and as∣sert it; so that in a little time, like a <HI>Gangrene,</HI> it spred it selfe into many parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> and since that hath enlarged it selfe like Hell; so that, at this present day it hath more that <HI>profess</HI> it in the world, then those which profess <HI>Christani∣ty,</HI> if we take in all collectively that doe but beare the Names of Christians, the world over.</P>
<P>The poore people, that are so much abused by the strong delusions of that great <HI>Impostor,</HI> say for themselves thus, that God hath sent three great <HI>prophets</HI> into the world, first <HI>Moses,</HI> and after him <HI>Christ,</HI> and then <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and further adde that when <HI>Christ</HI> left the world hee promised to send a <HI>Comforter</HI> into it, and that <HI>Comforter</HI> w <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="145"/>
and therefore they close with him.</P>
<P>I shall not neede amongst men professing Christianity to write any thing in answer to those their frantick assertions, neither will Imake it my business to enlarge my selfe in the discove∣ry of the <HI>Mahometan Religion,</HI> because that hath beene done by so many hands already; only this I wil say of it, &amp; not much more, that it hath <HI>Will-worship</HI> for its <HI>Foundation, Fables</HI> and <HI>Lyes</HI> for its <HI>support,</HI> and a groundless <HI>presumption</HI> for its <HI>super-structure.</HI></P>
<P>For its <HI>Foundation,</HI> first, abundance of <HI>will-worship,</HI> manifested in many outward perfor∣mances, which are not hard to be performed, because the depraved will of man, is ready prest and bent to performe things of that kind with readiness, Cheerfullness, and delight. <HI>The works of your Father the Devil you will doe,</HI> saith our Saviour, of the obstinate <HI>Jews,</HI> doe them, be they never so hard, with content and willingness.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>Mahometan Religion</HI> hath a∣bundance of <HI>strange, monstrous, fables</HI> and <HI>Lyes</HI> for its support, their <HI>Alcoran</HI> (for the sub∣stance of it) being a fardle of foolish impossibili∣ties, fit to be received by none but <HI>fooles,</HI> and <HI>mad-men;</HI> for they can gaine no more credit with those that are judicious, then what is rela∣ted in the ryming story of that antient Knight Errant, <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton;</HI> or in the Poems of <HI>Orlando</HI> the furious, where may be found some
<PB N="262" REF="146"/>
like such paralel fictions, as of <HI>Astalpho</HI> who mounted a <HI>Griffin,</HI> which car∣ried him up immediately into the <HI>Moon,</HI> where (they say) <HI>Mahomet</HI> somtime was, the reason I conceive which made himselfe, and his followers ever since so full of <HI>Lunacy,</HI> or <HI>mad∣ness.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, it hath a groundless <HI>presumption</HI> for its superstructure, which presumption drawes that mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-ed people into a carless security, they esteeming themselves the only true <HI>believers</HI> of the world, and none true belivers but them∣selves</P>
<P>Yet it cannot bee denied, but that there are some things in the precepts which <HI>Mahomet</HI> hath prescribed to be received and observed by his followers, that are good; layd downe in eight commandements which are these.</P>
<P>First, <HI>that God is a great God, and the only God, and Mahomet is the Prophet of God.</HI></P>
<P>Second, <HI>that Children must obey their pa∣rents, and doe nothing to displease them either in word or deed.</HI></P>
<P>Third, <HI>that every one must doe to another that, and only that which he would have ano∣ther doe to him.</HI></P>
<P>Fourth, <HI>that every man five times every day must repaire to the Mosquit or Church, to pray there, or wheresoever hee is, hee must pray e∣very day so often, if not in the Church, then elsewhere.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="146"/>
Fift, <HI>that one whole moone in every yeare, e∣very man, come to yeares of discretion, must spend the whole day, twixt the rising, and set∣ting of the Sunne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in fasting.</HI></P>
<P>Sixt, <HI>that every one out of his store, must give unto the poore liberally, freely, and volun∣tarily.</HI></P>
<P>Seventh, <HI>that every one (except those Vota∣ries which renounce marriage) must marry, to increase and multiply the Sect, and Religion of Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Eight, <HI>that no man must kill, or shed blood.</HI></P>
<P>Now much in these commandements agrees with <HI>the word of truth;</HI> and we neede not wonder at it, when we consider, that even the Devil himselfe (as we may observe in the Gos∣pel) hath sometimes had a Scripture in his mouth. So have <HI>Hereticks,</HI> and so did <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> and his assistants mix some Scripture in their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> to put a fairer gloss upon their irreligion. But what Scriptures they all urge, are for the most part, if not ever, wrest∣ed, by their mayming, or perverting, or misap∣plying of them. Thus the Devill quotes a Scrip∣ture Mat 4. 6. but one part is left out, and the rest miss▪ applied. Those therefore who wrest or mangle scripture to serve their owne turne, we may see from whose schoole they have it. Thus <HI>Mahomet</HI> cites scripture to doe more
<PB N="264" REF="147"/>
mischiefe by it; let no man content himselfe, and think all is well, because he can some∣times speak good words, have a scripture in his mouth; when he considers that <HI>Hereticks, Hypocrits</HI> doe so, that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> nay <HI>Satan</HI> himselfe hath done as much.</P>
<P><HI>Satan can transform himselfe into an An∣gel of light,</HI> and seeme holy to doe mischiefe. Thus <HI>Simeon,</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> (out of conscience pretended) <HI>could not give their Sister to an uncircumcised man.</HI> Gen. 34. there was <HI>God</HI> in their mouthes, but <HI>Satan</HI> in their hearts, they hide their <HI>Cruelty</HI> with <HI>Craft,</HI> and cover their <HI>Craft</HI> with <HI>Religion.</HI> Of all mischiefes, those that smile most, are most deadly. the uglyest and vilest of all projects well make use of <HI>Reli∣gion</HI> as a Foyle, to set them off; Poysoned <HI>Pills</HI> can finde <HI>Gold</HI> to <HI>cover</HI> them; because the <HI>worse</HI> that any thing is, the better <HI>shew</HI> it de∣sires to make.</P>
<P>But to proceed; the <HI>Mahometan priests</HI> are called <HI>Moolaas</HI> who read some parcells out of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> upon Frydays (which are their sabboths, or days of rest) unto the people assem∣bled in their <HI>Mosquit</HI> or Churches, and then fur∣ther deliver some precepts, which they gather out of it, unto their miserably deluded hearers.</P>

much of their time as Scriveners to doe busi∣nesses for others; or to teach their yong Chil∣dren to write and reade their language in writ∣ten hand, for (as before) they have no Printing. Those <HI>Moolaas</HI> are more distinguished from the rest of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> by their <HI>Beards</HI> (which they weare long) then by any other of their <HI>habits.</HI> Their calling gaines, and gives them very much reverence and esteeme amongst the People; as another sort of <HI>priests</HI> there have, of an high <HI>order</HI> or ranke▪ which live much re∣tired; but when they appeare openly are most highly reverenced; they are called <HI>Seayds</HI> who derive themselves from <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> have faire Churches which (as before) are called <HI>Mosquits;</HI> their Churches are built of Marble or Courser stone, the broad side towards the <HI>West</HI> is made up close like a firme wall, and so are both ends, in which there are no lights; the other broad side towards the <HI>East</HI> is erected upon <HI>Pillars</HI> (where a man may take notice of excellent workemanship both in vaults, and arches) the spaces betwixt them pillars stand open. Their Churches are built long and narrow, standing <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> which way they lay up the bodies of their dead, but none of them within their Churches.</P>
<P>At the four Corners of their <HI>Mosquits</HI> which
<PB N="266" REF="148"/>
stand in great Cityes or in other places much peopled, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are high and round, but small Turrets, which are made open with lights every way, wherein a man may be easily seene, and heard; their devout <HI>Moolaas five times every day</HI> ascend unto the tops of those high <HI>Turrets,</HI> whence they proclaim, as loudly as they can possibly speake, their Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> thus in Arabian, <HI>La alla illa alla, Mahomet Resul-alla</HI> that is, he re is no God but one God, and <HI>Ma∣homet the messenger from God,</HI> That voyce in∣stead of Bells, (which they use not in their Churches) puts the most devout in minde of the houres of their <HI>devotion,</HI> those <HI>Priests</HI> being exceedingly zealous to promote the cause, and to keep up the honour of their <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as the men of <HI>Ephesus</HI> sometime were, when they feared that the credit of their baggage <HI>Diana</HI> was like to be called into question, they took up a <HI>Cry which continued for the space of two houres,</HI> Crying out with one voyce, <HI>greaet is Diana of the Ephesians</HI> Act. 19. 24.</P>
<P>When a mans Religion is right, he ought to be very zealous in the maintenance of it, very fearefull of the hazard, or loss thereof. And therefore if these <HI>Mahometans,</HI> or those men of <HI>Ephesus</HI> had had truth on their side, they would both have deserved much commendation for what they did. And so <HI>Micha</HI> too who thus
<PB REF="148"/>
complained when he had lost his jmages, Judg. 18. 24. <HI>they have stol'n away my Gods, and what have I more?</HI> I confess that the loss of God is the greatest of all losses, but those were proper Gods which <HI>Micha</HI> there bewayled, that would be stol'n, that could not save themselves; who if the fire spare them, rust or rottenness, or time will consume them. But those <HI>Mahometans</HI> though they doe not en∣dure either <HI>Idoles</HI> or <HI>Images,</HI> in their houses, or Churches, yet are they very forward to cry up their irreligion and to shew much zeale for it.</P>
<P><HI>Zeale,</HI> is derived from a word that signifies to burne, it is a compound made up of many affections, as of <HI>griefe, joy, love, anger,</HI> well tempered together, and when it is so, it hath its due commendation both of God and man; and <HI>cursed is he that goes about to extinguish that holy fire,</HI> that holy fire (I say) which hath <HI>light</HI> in it as well as <HI>Heat,</HI> and heate as well as light. The truth of <HI>Zeale</HI> may be further discovered (of zeale that is good) if we confi∣der first the <HI>Roote</HI> from which it springs, and thats the <HI>knowledg</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of God; Second∣ly the <HI>Rule</HI> by which it is carryed on, and acts, and that's the <HI>word,</HI> and will of God, and last∣ly the <HI>end</HI> it aymes at, and intends, and that's the <HI>honour</HI> and glory of God; and <HI>zeale</HI> thus
<PB N="268" REF="149"/>
ordered cannot be too violent: but when for want of these it becomes irregular, and shews it selfe over much in bad causes (such as before were nam'd) it is, <HI>Cursus celerrimus, sed prae∣ter viam,</HI> a swift violent motion but quite out of the way.</P>
<P>And if it be good to be zealous in a good cause, then it is better to be zealous in the best: and the best cause to shew zeale in, is the cause of God, <HI>Pro Aris &amp; Focis</HI> was the old good Proverb; first to stand up for <HI>Gods rights,</HI> and afterward for <HI>our owne:</HI> and to believe that that <HI>vnum necessarium,</HI> which our <HI>Saviour</HI> commends unto us, Lu. 10, 42. is that one thing <HI>principally and especially necessary,</HI> though the Devill, and our owne corruption will tell us, (if we will believe them) that there is nothing more needless. When <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> came to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and spake unto him about <HI>sacrifi∣cing unto the Lord their God, Pharaoh</HI> replyes, <HI>yee are idle, yee are idle, therefore yee say let us goe and sacrifice unto the Lord,</HI> Ex. 5. 17. the same Devill that there spake in <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> speaks in all ignorant and prophane people, who call <HI>Religion</HI> idleness and <HI>hypocrisie;</HI> a <HI>strict</HI> and e∣ven walking with God, <HI>singularity</HI> or a doing more then God requires us to perform.</P>
<P>But however that is most true which was spoken by <HI>Philo judeus, ubi de religione, ibi
<PB N="269" REF="149"/>
quo{que} de vita agitur,</HI> we must act for religion as we would strive for life. <HI>Philosophy</HI> tels us that <HI>Tactus est fundamentum animae sensitivae,</HI> that the very foundation of natural life is feeling; so then no feeling no life, and the want of spi∣rituall feeling argues a want too of spirituall life. The poore seduced <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and many others in the world are very keene, and sharp and forward to maintaine that which they call Religion; the more shame for those who profess themselves Christians, and have a <HI>sure word</HI> to build their hope upon, yet are <HI>ferventissimi in terrenis, in coelestibus frigi∣dissimi,</HI> as hot as fire in <HI>earthly,</HI> as cold as ice in <HI>heavenly</HI> things. A sad thing to consider that so many should have <HI>their tongues bent like Bowes for lyes,</HI> (as the prophet <HI>Jeremy</HI> complaines <HI>Jer.</HI> 9. 37.) and <HI>Christians</HI> not vali∣ant for the truth; that others should drive like <HI>Jehu,</HI> furiously, madly, and that in the waies of <HI>error, injustice, oppression, prophaness,</HI> as in all other kinds of wickedness; and <HI>Christians</HI> in the cause of God more heavily, slowly, like the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> when their chariot wheeles were off. Shall <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>In∣fidels</HI> solicit bad causes so earnestly; and <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> those actions which are good so faintly! <HI>Acrius ad p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rniciem, quam nos ad vitam;</HI> make more hast to destruction then <HI>Christians</HI>

to life, and happiness! It was St. <HI>Jeromes</HI> com∣plaint, <HI>considerare pudet quantus feruor, quae cura,</HI> &amp;c. That he was asham'd to consi∣der how <HI>solici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous</HI> some men were in earthly, and how <HI>sluggish</HI> others in heavenly things, as if they durst not so much as to <HI>owne the cause of God▪</HI> they were wont to say of cowards in <HI>Rome,</HI> that there was nothing <HI>Roman</HI> in them; it may be applyed to <HI>Christians</HI> who shew no resolutions for <HI>Christ</HI> that there is nothing <HI>Christian</HI> in them, they even betraying the cause of <HI>Christ</HI> while they so faintly maintain it. Hardly would they dye for <HI>Christ,</HI> who dare not <HI>speake</HI> for him; certainly they would never be brought to afford him their <HI>blood,</HI> that will not for the present afford him their <HI>breath.</HI></P>
<P>But to returne againe to those <HI>Mahometan Priests,</HI> who out of zeale doe so often pro∣claim their <HI>Mahomet. Tom Coryat</HI> upon a time having heard their <HI>Moolaas</HI> often (as be∣fore) so to cry got him upon an high place di∣rectly opposite to one of those Priests, and con∣tradicted him thus. <HI>La alla illa alla, Hasaret Eesa Ben-alla,</HI> that is, no God, but one God, <HI>and the Lord Christ the Son of God,</HI> and further added that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was an <HI>Impostor:</HI> and all this he spake in their owne language as loud as possibly he could, in the eares of many <HI>Ma∣hometans</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="150"/>
that heard it. But whether (circum∣stances considered) the <HI>zeale,</HI> or <HI>discretion</HI> of our Pilgrim were more here to be commend∣ed, I leave to the judgment of my Reader. That he did so, I am sure, and I further believe how that bold attempt of his, if it had been acted in many other places of <HI>Asia,</HI> would have cost him his life with as much <HI>torture</HI> as cruel∣ty could have <HI>invented.</HI> But he was here taken for a mad-man, and so let alone.</P>
<P>Happly the rather, because every one there hath liberty to profess his owne Religion freely and if he please may argue against theirs, with∣out feare of an <HI>inquisition,</HI> as <HI>Tom Coryat</HI> did at another time with a <HI>Moolaa,</HI> and the Questi∣on which of these two was the <HI>Mussleman</HI> or true <HI>Believer,</HI> after much heate on both sides, <HI>Tom Coryat</HI> thus distinguished, that <HI>himselfe</HI> was the <HI>Orthodox Mussleman</HI> or true true be∣liever, the <HI>Moola</HI> the <HI>pseudo Mussleman</HI> or false true believers; which distinction, if I had not thought it would have made my Reader smile had been here omitted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> have a set forme of pray∣er in the <HI>Arabian tongue,</HI> not understood by many of the common people, yet repeated by them as well as by the <HI>Moolaas,</HI> they likewise rehearse the Names of God and of their <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> certain times every day upon <HI>Beads,</HI> like
<PB N="272" REF="151"/>
the miss-led <HI>Papists,</HI> who seem to regard more the <HI>Number,</HI> then the <HI>weight</HI> of prayers.</P>
<P>Certainly <HI>Will-worship</HI> is a very easy duty, and if Almighty God would be as much pleas∣ed with it, as man is, so much of that service would not be quite lost: But in those services wherein God is highly concern'd to rest in the performance of any <HI>duty,</HI> when tis done, or any other way to <HI>fayle</HI> in the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it, makes those services which some may e∣steeme <HI>holy,</HI> no better then <HI>Sins; Prayers,</HI> an <HI>Abomination:</HI> there being a vast difference twixt <HI>saying of prayers, and praying of prayers;</HI> twixt the service of the <HI>head,</HI> and that of the <HI>heart; prayer,</HI> and <HI>prayer</HI> (heedefull circum∣stances considered) differing as much as <HI>Reli∣gion,</HI> and <HI>Superstition.</HI></P>
<P>But for the carriage of that people in their devotions, before they goe into their <HI>Churches</HI> they <HI>wash their feet,</HI> and entring into them put off their <HI>shooes.</HI> As they begin their devotions they stop their <HI>eares,</HI> and fix their <HI>eyes,</HI> that nothing may divert their thoughts, then in a soft and still voyce they utter their <HI>prayers,</HI> wherein are many words most significantly expressing the <HI>Omnipotency,</HI> and <HI>Greatness,</HI> and <HI>Eternity,</HI> and other <HI>Attributes</HI> of God. Many <HI>words</HI> likewise that seeme to express much <HI>Hu∣miliation,</HI> they confessing in divers submissive
<PB REF="151"/>
gestures, their owne unworthiness, when they pray casting themselves low upon their <HI>Face,</HI> sundry times, and then acknowledg that they are <HI>Burdens</HI> to the <HI>Earth,</HI> and <HI>poyson</HI> to the <HI>Ayre,</HI> and the like, being so <HI>confounded</HI> and <HI>asham'd</HI> as that they seeme not to dare so much as to <HI>lift up</HI> their eyes towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> but after all this, comfort themselves in the <HI>mercyes</HI> of God, through the mediation of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>If this people could as well <HI>conclude,</HI> as they can begin and continue their <HI>prayers,</HI> in respect of their <HI>expressions,</HI> and <HI>carriages</HI> in them, they might find comfort; but the <HI>con∣clusion</HI> of their devotions <HI>marrs all.</HI></P>
<P>Yet this, for their <HI>commendation</HI> (who doubt∣less, if they knew better would pray better) that what <HI>divorsins,</HI> and <HI>impediments</HI> soever they have arising either from <HI>pleasure</HI> or <HI>profit,</HI> the <HI>Mahometans</HI> pray <HI>five times</HI> a <HI>day.</HI> The <HI>Mogol</HI> doth so, who sits on the <HI>Throne;</HI> the <HI>shepherd</HI> doth so that waits on his <HI>flock</HI> in the field, (where by the way, they doe not follow their flocks; but their flocks, them) all sorts of <HI>Mahometans</HI> doe thus whether <HI>fixed</HI> in a <HI>place</HI> or moveing in a <HI>journey,</HI> when their times, or hours of Prayer come, which in the morning are at <HI>Six, Nine,</HI> and <HI>Twelve</HI> of the clock; and at three and <HI>six</HI> in the afternoone.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="152"/>
When they pray it is their manner to set their <HI>Faces</HI> that they may look towards <HI>Me∣dina</HI> neere <HI>Mecha</HI> in <HI>Arabia</HI> where their great Seducer <HI>Mahomet</HI> was buried, who pro∣mised them after one thousand years, to fetch them all to Heaven; which terme, when it was out, and the promise not fulfilled, the <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI> concluded that their <HI>fore-Fathers</HI> miss∣tooke the <HI>time</HI> of the promise of his <HI>comming,</HI> and therefore resolved to <HI>waite</HI> for the accom∣plishment of it <HI>one thousand years more.</HI> In the mean time they doe so <HI>reverence</HI> that <HI>place</HI> where the body of <HI>Mahomet</HI> was <HI>lay'd</HI> up, that whosoever hath beene there (as there are divers which flock yearely thither in Pilgrimage) are for ever after called, and esteemed <HI>Hogg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> which signifies holy men.</P>
<P>And here the thing being rightly and serious∣ly considered, it is a very great shame that a <HI>Mahometan</HI> should pray five times every day, that <HI>Paganes</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> should be very fre∣quent in their devotions, and <HI>Christians</HI> (who only can hope for good answers in Prayer) so negligent in that <HI>great prevailing duty.</HI> For a <HI>Mahometan</HI> to pray <HI>five times</HI> every day, what diversions soever he hath to hinder him, and for a <HI>Christian</HI> to let any thing interrupt his devotion; for a <HI>Mahometan</HI> to pray five times a day, and for one that is called a Christian not
<PB N="275" REF="152"/>
to pray (some believing themselves above this and other ordinances) <HI>five times</HI> in a <HI>weeke,</HI> a <HI>moneth,</HI> a <HI>year.</HI></P>
<P>But this will admit less cause of wonder if wee consider how that many bearing the Names of Christians cannot pray at all, those I meane which are prophane and filthy, and who live as if there were no God to hear, or to <HI>judg,</HI> and no <HI>Hell</HI> to <HI>punish.</HI> Such as these can but <HI>babble,</HI> they cannot pray, for they <HI>blas∣pheme</HI> the Name of God, while they may thinke they <HI>adore it.</HI></P>
<P>I shall adde here a short storie, It happen∣ed that I once having some discourse with a <HI>Mahometan</HI> of good quality, and speaking with him about his <HI>frequent praying</HI> I told him that if himselfe, and others of his profession who did believe it as a duty to pray so often, could <HI>conclude</HI> their Petitions in the <HI>Name of Jesus Christ,</HI> they might finde much comfort in those their <HI>frequent performances,</HI> in that great <HI>duty:</HI> He answered, that I needed not to trouble my selfe with that, for they found as great comfort as they could desire in what they did. And presently he would needs inferr this Relation.</P>
<P>There was (said hee) a most devout <HI>Mus∣sleman</HI> who had his habitation in a great City where <HI>Mahomet</HI> was zealously professed, and that man for many yeares together spent his
<PB N="276" REF="153"/>
whole day in the <HI>Mosquit,</HI> or Church, in the mean time, he minding not the world at all, became so poor that he had nothing left to buy bread for his family, yet notwithstanding his poor condition he was resolved still to ply his devotions, and in a morning (when he percei∣ved that there was nothing at all left for the fur∣ther subsistence of himselfe and houshould) tooke a solemne leave of his wife and Children resolving for his part to goe and <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>dye</HI> in the <HI>Mosquit,</HI> leaving his family (if no relief came) to famish at home. But that very day he put on this resolution, there came to his house in his absence a very <HI>beautifull young man</HI> (as he appeared to be) who brought and gave unto his <HI>wife</HI> a very good quantity of <HI>Gold</HI> bound up in a white <HI>Napkin,</HI> telling her, that God had now remembred her husband, and sent him his <HI>pay</HI> for his constant paines taken in his <HI>devo∣tion,</HI> withall charging her not to send for her husband, for though he had taken such a so∣lemne leave of her that morning, yet he would come home to her againe that night, and so he departed from her. The woman presently bought in some necessaryes for her house (for they had eaten up all before) and further made some good provision for her husband against his coming home in the evening, (for so he did) and finding all his family very cherefull and merry, his Wife presently told him, that there had been
<PB N="277" REF="153"/>
such a one there (as before described) and left so much gold behinde him, with that fore men∣tioned message delivered with it. Her husband presently replyed that it was the <HI>Angel Gabriel</HI> sent from God, (for the <HI>Mahometans</HI> speak much of that <HI>Angel)</HI> and he further added that <HI>himselfe</HI> had <HI>nothing</HI> to bring home unto her but a little <HI>grett,</HI> or <HI>sand</HI> which he tooke up in his way homeward, and bound it in his gir∣dle, which he presently opening to shew her, it was all turn'd into <HI>pretious</HI> stones, which a∣mounted unto a very great value in Money. The <HI>Seventh part</HI> of which as of his gold likewise he presently gave to the <HI>poore,</HI> (for, said he, a <HI>Mussleman</HI> is very charitable) and then in∣ferrd, that if we doe not <HI>neglect</HI> God, God will not <HI>forget</HI> us, but when we stand most in <HI>need</HI> of help will <HI>supply</HI> us. Vnto which <HI>con∣clusion</HI> we may all subscribe, leaving the <HI>pre∣mises</HI> which are layd downe in that <HI>story,</HI> unto those that dare <HI>believe</HI> them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> say, that they have the Bookes of <HI>Moses,</HI> but they have very much cor∣rupted that story, in ascribing that to <HI>Ishmael</HI> which is said of <HI>Isaac</HI> Gen: 22. as if <HI>Ishmael</HI> should have beene sacrificed, not <HI>Isaac.</HI> (of which more afterward) They say that they have the Booke of <HI>Davids</HI> Psalmes; and some Writings of <HI>Solomon,</HI> with other parcels of the old <HI>Testament;</HI> which, if so, I believe a
<PB N="278" REF="154"/>
made much to vary from their original.</P>
<P>They speak very much in the Honour of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> whom they call <HI>Moosa Calim-Alla; Moses</HI> the publisher of the minde of God. So of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> whom they call <HI>Ibrahim Carim-Alla Abraham</HI> the Honored, or Friend of God.</P>
<P>So of <HI>Ishmael</HI> whom they call <HI>Ismal,</HI> the Sacrifice of God. So of <HI>Iacob▪</HI> whom they call <HI>Acob</HI> the blessing of God. So of <HI>Joseph,</HI> whom they call <HI>Eesoff▪</HI> the betray∣ed for God. So of <HI>David,</HI> whom they call <HI>Dahood</HI> the Lover, and prayser of God. So of <HI>Solomon,</HI> whom they call <HI>Selymon</HI> the wisdome of God, all expressed, as the former, in short <HI>A∣rabian</HI> words, which they sing in ditties unto their particular remembrances.</P>
<P>And, by the way, many of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> there are called by the names of <HI>Moosa,</HI> or <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> or <HI>Ismal,</HI> or <HI>Acob▪</HI> or <HI>Eesoff</HI> or <HI>Dahood,</HI> or <HI>Selymon:</HI> so others are called <HI>Mahmud,</HI> or <HI>Chaan,</HI> which signifies the Moone; or <HI>Frista,</HI> which signifies astarre, &amp;c. And they call their women by the Names of <HI>Flowers</HI> or <HI>Fruits</HI> of their Countrey, or by the names of <HI>Spices</HI> or <HI>Odours,</HI> or of <HI>pearls,</HI> or <HI>precious Stones,</HI> or else by other Names of pretty or pleasing signification. As <HI>Iob</HI> named one of his daughters <HI>Jemimah,</HI> which signifies, <HI>Cleare as the day,</HI> the second <HI>Keziah,</HI> which signifies <HI>pleasant</HI> as <HI>Cassia</HI> or sweete spice. And the name of the third <HI>Keren-happuch,</HI> signify∣ing
<PB N="279" REF="154"/>
the <HI>Horne</HI> or <HI>strength</HI> of <HI>beauty,</HI> Iob 42. 14.</P>
<P>But I'll return again to that people that I may acquaint my reader with one thing of spe∣ciall observation and tis this: That there is not one among the Mahometans (of any under∣standing) which at any time mentions the name of our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> called there <HI>Hazare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ee∣sa</HI> the <HI>Lord Christ,</HI> but he makes mention of it with <HI>high Reverence</HI> and respect. For they say of <HI>Christ</HI> that he was a good man and a just, that he <HI>lived without sin,</HI> that he did greater miracles than ever any before or since him nay further they call him <HI>Rha-how-Alla,</HI> the <HI>breath of God,</HI> but how he should be the Son of God, cannot conceive, and therefore cannot believe.</P>
<P>Perhaps the <HI>Socinians</HI> first tooke that their o∣pinion from these, which bids them to have e∣very thing they receive as truth, to be cleered up unto them by the strength of Reason, as if there were no need of the exercise of faith.</P>
<P>And truly (I must needs confess) that to beleeve <HI>the Incarnation of the Son of God,</HI> is one of the hardest and greatest taskes for Faith to encoun∣ter withall that God should be <HI>made a Man,</HI> that this Man Christ should be born of a Vir∣gin, that <HI>Life</HI> should s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring from <HI>Death,</HI> and that from <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Scorne, Triumph,</HI> and <HI>Victorie should come,</HI> &amp;c. But Christians must bind up all their thoughts, as to these, in that
<PB N="280" REF="155"/>
excellent meditation of <HI>Picus Mirandula,</HI> say∣ing, <HI>Mirandam Dei Incarnationem,</HI> &amp;c. concerning that admirable, and wonderfull In∣carnation of <HI>Christ the Son of God,</HI> I shall not say much, it being sufficient for me, as for all others that look for benefit by Christ, to be∣lieve, that he was begotten, and that he was born. These are Articles of our Faith; and we are not christians if we believe them not.</P>
<P>It may seem very strange therefore, that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> (who understand themselves better) should have such a very high esteem of our <HI>Blessed Saviour Christ,</HI> and yet think us who profess our selves <HI>Christians</HI> to be so un∣worthy, or so uncleane, as that they will <HI>not eat with us,</HI> any thing that is of out <HI>dressing,</HI> nor yet of any thing that is dressed in our <HI>vessels.</HI></P>

<P>This people after their retirement, will choose rather to <HI>famish</HI> then to <HI>stirr</HI> from their <HI>Cells:</HI> and therefore they are relieved by the Charity of others, who take care to send them some very meane covering for their bodies (for it must be such otherwise they will not accept of it) when they stand in neede thereof, and something for their bodily sustenance, which must be of their courser food, otherwise they will not take it, and no more of that at one time then what is sufficicnt for the present support of nature.</P>

<P>And others there are amongst them they call religious men, who wear nothing about them but to hide their <HI>Shame,</HI> and these (like the <HI>men∣dicant Fryars)</HI> beg for all they eate.

and all to no purpose. O what pains will su∣perstition put men unto! It is said of <HI>Idolaters, that they hasten after another God.</HI> Ps. 16. 4. or they make post-hast after him. The <HI>Philistims</HI> flock't early, and in troopes to the Temple of their <HI>Dagon;</HI> A shame that Christians should goe singly and slowly, and many times late (as they doe) unto the house of God, dealing with religious duties, as school-boyes doe very often with their lessons, in minding every thing more than the business they are about. What pitty it is to see people so industrious in their miss-devotion in doing things very hard to be done which God never required at their hands! which may make us to believe that if they were rightly made acquainted with what God <HI>would have them to doe,</HI> they would be carefull in do∣ing it.</P>

A man is naturally apt to think that God is with him while he prospers though in evill.

and Permission of Almighty God; thus Good things are done by his Privity, Assistance and Approbation; things that are Evill, by his Pri∣vity, Permission, but not Liking. The wicked are called the sword of God. <HI>Ps. 17. &amp;c.</HI> They do his will in executing his vengeance, so <HI>Babylon</HI> was called the Hammer, and <HI>Assyria</HI> the Rod of the Lord; But these Swords, and Hammers, and Rods when they have done the service which was appointed for them to doe, are thrown into the fire, and meet with grea∣ter Vengeance afterward, then they had for∣merly executed.

<P>It must needs be therefore a sin transcendent∣ly wicked, for any who know God and his Truth, to entitle God and Religion unto acti∣ons that are Evill, by fathering prosperous wickedness upon them, as if they did at all countenance such things as Reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ion flatly for∣bids, and Almighty God professedly abhors.</P>

<P>But to return again to these <HI>Mohometans;</HI> They keep a solemn <HI>Lent,</HI> they call the <HI>Ram-jan,</HI> or <HI>Ramdam,</HI> which begins the first New∣moon, which happens in <HI>September,</HI> and so con∣tinues during that whole Moon. And all that time, those that are strict in their Religion, forbear their Women: and will not take either Meat or Drink any Day during that time, so long as the Sun is above their <HI>Horizon,</HI> but after the Sun is set they eat at pleasure. The last day of their <HI>Ramjan,</HI> they consecrate as a
<PB N="291" REF="160"/>
day of <HI>mourning</HI> to the memory of their deceas∣ed <HI>friends,</HI> when I have observed many of the <HI>meanner sort,</HI> seeme to make most <HI>bitter la∣mentation.</HI> But when that day of their general mourning is ended, &amp; begins to dye into night, they fire an innumerable company of <HI>lamps,</HI> and other <HI>lights;</HI> which they hang or fix very thick, and set upon the tops of their <HI>houses,</HI> and all other most conspicuous places near their great <HI>Tanks,</HI> that are surrounded with build∣ings, where those <HI>lights</HI> are <HI>doubled</HI> by their <HI>Reflection</HI> upon the water, and when they are all burnt out; the ceremoy is done, and the people take food.</P>
<P>The day after this <HI>Ram-jan</HI> is fully ended, the most devout <HI>Mahometans</HI> in a solemn manner assemble to their? <HI>Misquits,</HI> where by their <HI>Moolaas,</HI> (some selected parts of the <HI>Al∣coran)</HI> are publickly read unto them, which <HI>book</HI> the <HI>Moolaas</HI> never <HI>touch</HI> without an ex∣pression of much outward reverence.</P>
<P>For their works of charity, there are some rich men that build <HI>Sarraes</HI> in great Cities, and Towns (spoken of before) where passen∣gers may find <HI>house-room</HI> and that freely, without a return of any <HI>recompence,</HI> wherein themselves, and goods may be in safety.</P>
<P>Others make <HI>wells</HI> and <HI>Tanks</HI> for the pub∣lick benefit; Or maintain <HI>servants,</HI> which con∣tinually attend upon <HI>road-wayes</HI> that are much

<P>Now lastly for a close of this section. I shall intreat my Reader to call to mind, and to take a second, and a very <HI>serious view</HI> of the reve∣rence and a we which seemes (so far as eyes can judge) to be in that people; <HI>Reverence</HI> and awe (I say) of the <HI>Majestie</HI> before whom they appear when they are in their devotions.</P>
<P>Whose most submissive <HI>carriage</HI> in that du∣ty, doth very much <HI>condemn</HI> infinite <HI>numbers</HI> of those. who professe <HI>Christ</HI> while they are in Religious services, <HI>rushing</HI> upon, and <HI>conti∣nuing,</HI> in those holy duties, without any seem∣ing <HI>reverence</HI> or <HI>regard</HI> at all of the dreadfull <HI>Majestie</HI> before whom they <HI>appeare,</HI> as if <HI>God were not,</HI> or as if he were <HI>not worth the regard∣ing;</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="161"/>
As if <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> and <HI>judgment,</HI> an everlasting separation from the prelence of God for evermore, were <HI>tearms</HI> meerely inven∣ted to affright people <HI>withall,</HI> and as if there were no such <HI>places</HI> and no such <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>I confesse it is true that external <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> by bowing the body in the performances of Religious duties and the like may be <HI>found</HI> in the <HI>falshood of Religion,</HI> and when a man <HI>rests</HI> in these alone easy <HI>performances,</HI> it is to <HI>com∣plement</HI> with Almighty God, &amp; not to <HI>worship him,</HI> yet as he looks for <HI>more</HI> than these in our humble addresses to him: So he expects <HI>these</HI> likewise, for without all doubt the most sub∣missive <HI>gesture</HI> of the <HI>body</HI> in this case may both <HI>expresse</HI> and <HI>further</HI> the <HI>piety</HI> of the <HI>soul.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore though the <HI>God of spirits,</HI> doth most regard the <HI>soul</HI> of our devotions, and looks most at the <HI>heart,</HI> while holy duties are performing, yet it is true likewise that it is not only <HI>unmannerly,</HI> but most <HI>irreligious,</HI> to be <HI>misgestured</HI> in <HI>them,</HI> the <HI>carless</HI> and uncomly carriage of the body in this case, making the <HI>soul</HI> to be prophane &amp; <HI>signifying</HI> it so to be. <HI>To him will I look even to him, that is poor and of a contrite spirit, that trembleth at my words Es.</HI> 66. 2.

<P><HI>Sancta Sancté,</HI> holy duties must be done in

<P>AMongst many other things that confirm the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in their irreligion, this certainly is not the least, the indulgence which <HI>Mahomet</HI> gives them to take more wives than one (for they may take four if they please) and that further promise which that monstrous <HI>Seducer</HI> hath made unto his followers of a fleshly <HI>Paradise</HI> hereafter, wherein he will pro∣vide for them all wives which shall have large rowling eyes, which they look upon in that sex as a great beauty. And it is a very suitable comfort for such as walk so much after the flesh.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="164"/>
For <HI>Poligamy,</HI> or the having of more wives than one, <HI>Lamech</HI> a great Grand-child of <HI>Cain,</HI> was the first that brought it into the World, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 19. And it was first brought into the Church by <HI>Abraham:</HI> which act of his, as of others after him (good men in their generation) though it found <HI>permission,</HI> never had <HI>approba∣tion</HI> from Almighty God. And further, though under the times of the Law it found some <HI>con∣nivence,</HI> yet since the Gospel there hath been <HI>no such custom in any of the Churches of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And in those former times it was the charge of Almighty God to the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> even before they were, <HI>that they should not multiply wives,</HI> Deut. 17. 17. Yet <HI>Solomon</HI> (who in this discovered a great deal of folly, as in other things abundance of wisdom) went further be∣yond the bounds of that Law, than any other whom God owns in Scripture. The poor man in his later age lost himself amongst an house full of wives. For the storie saith, <HI>that he loved many strange women,</HI> 1 King. 11. 1. Every word had nothing but <HI>Bane</HI> in it.

The <HI>Abissins</HI> say, that when the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Sheba</HI> came to visite <HI>Solomon,</HI> that she return∣ed back with Childe by him, from whose issue (they further say) have come the race of their Kings ever since. But here I leave my Reader to believe in that as much, and no more than he please. This is clear in the sacred storie, that <HI>Solomon,</HI> though he had a thousand wives and Concubines, he had but three Children, <HI>Reho∣boam</HI> his onely Son, and <HI>Taphal,</HI> and <HI>Basmah</HI> his two Daughters, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 4. 11. 15. an evi∣dent sign that God never approved of his mul∣titude of wives, when by his blessing on the single and holy wedlock of others, he hath mul∣tiplied them in a very happy and numerous issue.</P>

He who fol∣lows nothing but his eyes in the choise of a wife, that marries a beauty, or a face, or a por∣tion, may after finde a Philistine in his bed,

<P>The truth is, that many a Childe hath been cast away upon riches, and therefore wealth in peoples matches should be as some Grains, or Scrupses in a Ballance, superadded unto the Gold of virtuous qualities, to weigh down the Scales.

weaknesse, &amp; <HI>Solomon</HI> (whom before I nam'd) so much renowned for wisdom, had not mani∣fested so much folly in miscarrying so fearfully by wives, which turned away his heart from God; and therefore when he was come again to himself, he freely confesseth to all the world, <HI>Eccles. 7. 28. that he found more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is as snares and nets, and her hands as bands, who so pleased God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be ta∣ken by her.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Mahometans</HI> trouble not them∣selves with these thoughts for though some of that people, as the strict votaries there, marry not at all; and the <HI>Moolaas</HI> content them∣selves with one wife, and so do some others: yet they that please may have four wives, and as many women beside as they can get, and keep; whom they command as wives, and this liberty there is denied to none that will make use of it.</P>

Often have I heard this question put how these <HI>Mahomitans</HI> can do with so many wives, some of which they keep pent up in little Cot∣tages, or Tents, and in other places and parts of the World, where mens dwellings are ve∣ry large and spacious, there is scarce room e∣nough to be found for one wife, in a great house.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who have most wives, and women, are most jealous, and their jealousie such, as that they will not suffer the Brothers, or Fathers of their wives to come to them, or to have any speech with them, except it be in their presence. And a continued custom by this restraint hath made it odious for such wo∣men, as have the reputation of honesty, to be seen at any time by any man, besides their own husbands, or by those before named, and by them but very seldom. But if they dishonour their husbands beds, or being unmarried are found incontinent and filthy, professing chastity, rather than they shall want the severest punish∣ment, their own Brothers hands will be first against them to take away their lives, and for so doing, shall be commended, but nor questi∣oned.</P>

To what an height of wickednesse can licentiousnesse raise up a man, in making him to urge such a relation as a wife (and because a wife) to be the onely reason of his dislike, or disaffection; which should be the firmest bond of his love.

<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 18.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their burials, of their mourning for their dead, and of their stately Se∣pulchres and Monuments.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> it is their manner to wash the bodies of their dead before they interre them. An ancient custom as it should seem among the <HI>Jews,</HI> for it is said of <HI>Dorcas,</HI> that after she was dead, they washed her bo∣dy, as a preparative to her burial, <HI>Act.</HI> 9. 37.</P>
<P>They lay up none of the bodies of their dead in their <HI>Misquits,</HI> or Churches (as before) but in some open place in a grave, which they dig very deep and wide, a Jewish custom, like∣wise to carry the bodies of their dead to bury them out of their Cities and Towns, <HI>Luke</HI> 7. 12.</P>
<P>Their mourning over their dead is most im∣moderate,
<PB N="306" REF="169"/>
for besides that day of general la∣mentation at the end of their <HI>Ram-Jan,</HI> or Lent, (before mentioned) they houl and cry many whole dayes for their friends departed, immediately after they have left the world and after that time is passed over, many foolish wo∣men, so long as they survive, very often in the year, observe set dayes to renue their mourn∣ing for their deceased friends, and as a people without hope, bedew the graves of their hus∣bands, as of other their near relations, with abundance of (seemingly) affectionate tears; as if they were like those mourning women mentioned, <HI>Jer.</HI> 9. 17. who seemed to have tears at command, and therefore were hired to mourn and weep in their solemne lamenta∣tions.</P>
<P>And when they thus lament over their dead, they will often put this question to their deaf and dead Carkasses, why they would die? They having such loving wives, such loving friends, and many other comforts, as if it had been in their power to have rescued themselves from that most impartial wounding hand of death.</P>
<P>Which carriage of theirs deserves nothing but censure and pity though if it be not Theatrical, we may much wonder at it, and say of it as it was said of the mourning in the floor of <HI>Atad, Gen. 50. 11. that it is a grievous mourning,</HI> or
<PB N="307" REF="169"/>
<HI>as the mourning of</HI> Hadadrimmon <HI>in the val∣ley of</HI> Megiddon, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12. 11. if we take those lamentations onely in a literal sence.</P>
<P>But to speak unto this as a Christian; cer∣tainly the Apostle, <HI>who forbids immoderate mourning for friends departed,</HI> 1 shef. 4. 13. imployes and allows of that mourning which is moderate.</P>
<P>To behold a great Funeral, where there are abundance of mourning garments, and no weeping eyes, is not a good sight; for a man to die as <HI>Jehojakim</HI> (a very bad Son of an excel∣lent good Father) of whom it was sadly pro∣phesied, <HI>that he should die without lamentation, non plangent eum, Eheu frater, they shall not la∣ment for him, saying, Ah my brother!</HI> his <HI>Ashes</HI> should not be moistned with one <HI>tear,</HI> and to be buried as <HI>Jehojakim was with the burial of an Asse,</HI> Jer. 2. 18, 19. is very sad. And doubt∣lesse it had been better for a man never to have been born, than to live undesired and to die unlamented. For a man to run a long race through the world, and to leave no token of good behinde him but to be like an Arrow shot by a strong arm up into the aire; wherein it flies a great circuit, yet immediately after it is fal'n, it cannot be discern'd that it was ever there, I may say of such a one, that <HI>he was born out of due time,</HI> or rather that <HI>it had been good for him if he had not been born at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="170"/>
But now further concerning their places of Burial, many <HI>Mahometans</HI> of the greatest qua∣litie in their life time provide fair Sepulchres for themselves and nearests friends compassing with a firm wall, a good circuit of ground near some <HI>Tank,</HI> (before spoken of) about which they de∣light to Burie their dead, or else they close in a place for this use, near springs of water, that may make pleasant fountains, near which they erect little <HI>Misquits,</HI> or Churches, &amp; near them <HI>Tombs▪</HI> built round, or four square, or in six, or eight squares, with round vaults, or Canopies of stone over head, all which are excellently well wrought, and erected upon P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llars, or else made close to be entered by doors every way, under which the bodies of their dead lie inter∣red, the rest of that ground thus circled in, they plant with fruit Trees, and further set therein all their choisest flowers, as if they would make <HI>Elysian fields</HI> (such as the Poets dream'd of) wherein their Souls might take repose.</P>
<P>Thus to bury (as it should seem) was an ancient custom, for it is written of <HI>Manasseh King of</HI> Judah, <HI>that he was buried in the gar∣den of his own house</HI> so of his Son <HI>Amon, that he was buried in that garden likewise, 2 King.</HI> 21. 18. and 26. verses, thus I <HI>seph</HI> of <HI>Arima∣thea</HI> had his Sepulchre in his garden, and it was well placed there, that when he was in the place of his greatest delight, his meditations
<PB N="309" REF="170"/>
might be seasoned with the thoughts of his death.</P>
<P>There are many goodly Monuments which are richly adorned; built (as before was ob∣served) to the memory of such as they have esteemed <HI>Paeres,</HI> or Saints (of whom they have a large <HI>Kalender)</HI> in which are Lamps conti∣nually burning, attended by votaries, unto whom they allow Pensions for the maintaining of those lights; and many (transported there with wilde devotion) dayly resort to those mo∣numents, there to contemplate the happinesse those <HI>Paeres</HI> (as they imagine) now enjoy.</P>
<P>And certainly of all the places that Empire affords, there are none that minister more de∣light, than some of their burying places do, neither do they bestow so much cost, nor shew so much skill in <HI>Architecture</HI> in any other structures, as in these.</P>
<P>Now amongst many very fair <HI>Piles</HI> there dedicated to the remembrance of their dead, the most famous one is at <HI>Secandra,</HI> a Vil∣lage three miles from <HI>Agra;</HI> it was begun by <HI>Achabar-sha</HI> the late <HI>Mogols</HI> Father, who there lies buried, and finished by his Son, who since was laid up beside him. The materials of that most stately Sepulchre are Marble of divers colours, the stones so closely cemented together, that it appears to be but one conti∣nued stone, built high like a <HI>Pyramis</HI> with ma∣ny
<PB N="310" REF="171"/>
curiosities about it, and a fair <HI>Misquit</HI> by it, the Garden wherein it stands very large planted (as before) and compassed about with a Wall of Marble, this most sumptuous <HI>Pile</HI> of all the structures that vast Monarchy affords, is most admired by strangers. <HI>Tom. Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at</HI> had a most exact view thereof, and so have many other <HI>English</HI> men had, all which have spoken very great things of it.</P>
<P>And if we here step aside, to look into other Countreys and stories, we may observe much to this purpose, (though none that I have ever heard of like that I last named) where many, whose foregoing lives, have little deserved those following remembrances, yet after death have had their bodies lodged in rich Monuments, when others of great worth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and most deserved memory have been very obscurely buried.</P>
<P><HI>Varro</HI> writes of <HI>Licinius,</HI> or <HI>Licinus,</HI> but a Barber to <HI>Augustus Caefar,</HI> who getting wealth, was after his death honoured with a fair Monument of Marble, when grave and wise <HI>Cato</HI> had but a small meer stone to cover him, and renowned <HI>Pompey</HI> had in this kinde no remembrance at all, of all whom <HI>Varro</HI> briefly writes thus:</P>
<Q><L>Marmoreo Licinus tumulo jacet, at Cato parvo,</L>
<L>Pompeius nullo.—</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="311" REF="171"/>
<L>Licinus <HI>entomb'd under rich Marble stone:</HI></L>
<L>Cato <HI>a small one had: Great</HI> Pompey none.</L></Q>
<P>When <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> had vanquished <HI>Ptolo∣mey,</HI> and the distressed King hoped to preserve his life by flying into a Boat, there were so ma∣ny of his Souldiers which followed him, that they lost their lives by that very means they hoped to preserve them; for their too much weight sunk the Boat, and they all with their most unhappy King drown'd together. Con∣cerning whom, I have what here follows (but a little varied) thus observed to my hand.</P>
<Q><L>Mixt with <HI>Plebeians</HI> there a Monarch lies,</L>
<L>The last o'th race of <HI>Egypts Ptolomeys.</HI></L>
<L>Under no covert but his <HI>Niles</HI> cold waves:</L>
<L>No <HI>Pyramids,</HI> nor rich Mansolian graves,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Arched</HI> vaults whose structures do excell</L>
<L>As his forefathers <HI>Ashes</HI> proudly dwell.</L>
<L>And dead, as living do their wealth expresse,</L>
<L>In sumptuous Tombes, or gorgious Palaces.</L></Q>
<P>This was the Fate of that last <HI>Egyptian Mo∣narch,</HI> and it is sad to consider, that an <HI>Egypti∣an Monarch</HI> should be buried under water and mudd, and a <HI>Roman Barber</HI> covered with Marble.</P>
<P>The like hath been the condition of many others, who have deserved in their generation lasting remembrances in this kinde, but have not found them, when others, who have merited
<PB N="312" REF="172"/>
nothing at all, have had much said, and (in that respect) much done for them after death. And therefore one of this age, very eminent for great parts, writing of a great man, by place, and deserts, but obscurely buried; and observing rich Monuments set off with large and unde∣served <HI>Encomiums</HI> for others, which deserved them not, first blames
<Q><L>—The flattering stone</L>
<L>Which oft belies the dead when he is gone.</L></Q></P>
<P>And after writes further in relation to him before mentioned; thus</P>
<Q><L>Let such, as fear their rising, purchase vaul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</L>
<L>And statues, onely to excuse their faults.</L>
<L>While, thou shalt rise thorough thy easie dust</L>
<L>At the last day, these would not, but they must.</L></Q>
<P>And truly if we consider, and impartially read many <HI>Hyperbolical</HI> expressions engraven upon some Monuments, we may make a pause at the two first words, which are commonly these. <HI>Here lies,</HI> and write them thus, <HI>hear lies,</HI> and there make a stop, because little, or nothing that follows hath any truth in it. And there∣fore though many great and rich men, have their bodies after death covered with stately <HI>Piles,</HI> which hold forth many, and high com∣mendations of them, yet these cannot keep their
<PB N="313" REF="172"/>
names from putrifying and rotting as much above ground, as their bodies do under it. <HI>The name of the wicked shall rot,</HI> Prov. 10. 17. <HI>His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street,</HI> Job 18. 17. or if their names survive, and be remembred, they shall but continue their shame, as here lies, or there dwelt such an oppressor, such a cruel, or such a covetous Muck-worm, or such a filthy, or such a prophane ungodly person, or such an intemperate drunken sot; whom many times such an inscription would fit, (if it were writ∣ten over their doors) as <HI>Diogenes</HI> sometimes caused to be written upon the door of a like in∣temperate person, who had written before that his house was to be sold, under which that <HI>Cy∣nick</HI> wrote thus, I thought this house would surfet so long, that it would spue out its master, for <HI>God shall take such away, and pluck them out of their dwelling places, and root them out of the land of the living,</HI> or as the Prophet <HI>Jere∣miah</HI> speaks, <HI>their dwellings shall cast them out.</HI></P>
<P>But however they which deserve true honour, should have it both alive and dead. <HI>The me∣mory of the just shall be blessed. Abel</HI> was the first that ever tasted death, and he died by vio∣lence, he died for Religion. Oh how early did Martyrdom creep into the world! yet <HI>Abol,</HI> who hath been so long dead, <HI>yet speaketh,</HI> Heb. 11. 4. or the Testimony which Almighty God
<PB N="314" REF="173"/>
gave of that righteous <HI>Abel</HI> is yet spoken of, and so shall be, till eternity hath swallowed up time.</P>
<P><HI>The remembrance of</HI> Josiah <HI>is like a compo∣sition of the perfume that is made by the art of the Apothecary, sweet in all mouths</HI> &amp;c. and so shall remain; when stately Monuments erected to preserve the memorie of others, shall be so <HI>defaced,</HI> that it will not appear where they <HI>once were.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, all Kings and Potentates of the earth of what Nation soever they be, must first, or last lay down their swords and Scepters, and Trophies at the gates of death. No earthly King shall ever carry his Crown further, than <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Cyrenian</HI> did the Crosse, to <HI>Golgotha,</HI> to the grave, which narrow compasse of earth, shall at last put a confinement to all their great thoughts, who have believed (as <HI>Alexander</HI> sometime did▪ the whole world by much to little, to bound their desires.</P>

But if the body be embalm∣ed with all sweet Odors and Spices, if chested in, or covered with Marble, or with any thing that is richer, and the Soul all this while in torments, condemned to everlasting burnings, what comfort can it take; no more, nay, not so much as a man who hath a curious Crimson <HI>Silk-stocking,</HI> drawn over a broken, or a Gou∣ty and tormenting Leg.</P>
<P>For the Saints departed hence <HI>non tumulos curant,</HI> when <HI>their Souls are bound up in a; bundle of life,</HI> and they enjoy the company <HI>of all the blessed spirits made perfect,</HI> they care not what becomes of their earthly parts. As be∣fore
<PB N="317" REF="174"/>
they went into their Chambers to undresse themselves: so now they go down into their graves to put off their <HI>nasty</HI> and <HI>dirty raggs,</HI> that when they arise thence they may be inve∣sted with <HI>Roabs</HI> that are rich and glorious, well knowing that <HI>Christ at the last day will change their vile bodies, and make them like unto his glorious body.</HI> While a mans Soul is safe it is not at all to be heeded what becomes of his body: That may be slain, but cannot be hurt, as bold and good <HI>Ignatius</HI> told his persecutor <HI>occidere potes, laedere non potes,</HI> thou canst kill me, but thou canst not hurt me. The good man may be stripped of all his temporall riches, but <HI>that long enduring substance laid up for him in the Heavens,</HI> is above all his enemies reach. They may be degraded here from all their worldly <HI>honours,</HI> but not of this honour to be the <HI>servants of God.</HI> They may be deprived of their lives, but not of their salvation. The ex∣ecutioner that cut off Saint <HI>Paul's head,</HI> could not take away his Crown. And therefore whither they breath forth their lives out of the mouth of the body, or the mouth of a wound, it is all one—<HI>vivit post funer a virtus;</HI> the virtuous man out-lives his life, and after findes, that there are no such lasting <HI>monuments,</HI> as to be <HI>entomb'd</HI> in the hearts of the good who will be ever shewing forth the praises of those, which have deserv'd them.

<HEAD>SECT. XIX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Hindooes, or Heathens which inhabite that Empire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ANd for these, the first that I shall take notice of, is, that they agree with others in the world, about the first Roots of man∣kinde <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and the first of them they call <HI>Babba Adam,</HI> or <HI>Adamah,</HI> Father <HI>Adam,</HI> and the second <HI>Mamma Havah,</HI> Mo∣ther <HI>Eve.</HI> And from <HI>Adam</HI> they call a man <HI>Adams.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Adam</HI> they further say, that when his wife was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit, she took it and chaud it, and then swallowed it down, but when her husband was swallowing it, the hand of God stop't it in his Throat, and
<PB N="319" REF="175"/>
from hence (they say) that every man hath there an hollow bunch which women have not.</P>
<P>The names they give to distinguish one man from another are many, and amongst them these following are very common. As <HI>Juddo,</HI> or <HI>Midas,</HI> or <HI>Cooregee,</HI> or <HI>Hergee,</HI> and the like. <HI>Casturia</HI> and <HI>Prescotta,</HI> are Womens names amongst them, but whither these, as those names they call their men, or women by, are names of signification, or onely of sound I know not.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Hindooes</HI> are a very laborious, and an industrious people: these are they which till and plant the ground, and breed the Cattle, these are they which make and sell those cu∣rious Manufactures, or the Cloath and stuffe which this Empire affords.</P>
<P>This people marry into, and consequently still keep in their own <HI>Tribes, Sects, Occupa∣tions,</HI> and <HI>Professions.</HI> For instance all <HI>Bramins</HI> (which are their Priests, the Sons of all which are Priests, likewise) are married to <HI>Bramins</HI> daughters, so a Merchants son marries a Mer∣chants daughter, and so men of several trades marry to the same trade. Thus a <HI>Coolee,</HI> (who is a tiller of the ground) marries his son to a <HI>Colees</HI> daughter; and so in all other professions they keep themselves to their own Tribes and Trades, not mixing with any other, by which means they never advance themselves higher than they were at first.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="176"/>
They take but one wife, and of her they are not so fearfull and jealous as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are of their several wives and women, for they suffer their wives to go abroad whether they please. They are married very young, about six, or seven years old, their Parents making Matches for them, who lay hold of every op∣portunity to bestow their Children, because confin'd to their own Tribes, they have not such variety of choise as otherwise they might have▪ and when they attain to the age of thir∣teen, or fourteen, or fifteen years at the most they bed together.</P>
<P>Their marriages are solemnized (as those of the <HI>Mahometans)</HI> with much company, and noise, but with this difference, that both the young couple ride openly on Hors-back, and for the most part they are so little, that some go on their Horse sides to hold them up from falling. They are bedeckt, or strewed all over their Cloathing, with the choise flowers of that Countrey, fastned in order all about their Gar∣ments.</P>
<P>For their habits they differ very little from the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> but are very like them civil∣ly clad, but many of their women were Rings on their Toes, and therefore go bare foot. They we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r likewise broad Rings of Brasse, or better Metal upon their Wrists, and small of their Legs, to take of and on.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="176"/>
They have generally (I mean the women) the flaps, or tips of their ears boared when they are young, which holes daily extended and made wider, by things put and kept in them for that purpose, at last become so large, as that they will hold Rings (hollowed on the out-side like Pullies) for their flesh to rest in that are as broad in their circumference, some of them (I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dare say) as little Sawcers. But though those fashions of theirs seem very strange at first sight, yet they keep so constantly to them, as to all their other habites without any alteration, that their general and continual wearing of them makes them to seem lesse strange unto others which behold them.</P>
<P>And for their Diet very many of them (as the <HI>Banians</HI> in general (which are a very strict Sect) will eat of nothing that hath had, or may have life. And these live upon Herbs, &amp; Roots, and Bread▪ and Milk, and Butter, and Cheese, and Sweet-meats, of which they have many made very good by reason of their great abun∣dance of Sugar. Others amongst them will eat fish, but of no living thing else. The <HI>Rash∣boots</HI> will eat Swines flesh, which is most hate∣full to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> some will eat one kinde of flesh, some of another (of all very sparingly) but all the <HI>Hind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os</HI> in general ab∣stain from Beef, out of an high and over-excel∣lent esteem they have of Kine, and therefore
<PB N="322" REF="177"/>
give the <HI>Mogol</HI> yearly, besides his other e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣ctions, great sums of money as a ransom for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose Creatures; whence it comes to passe, that amongst other good provisions, we meet there but with little Beef.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Mahometans</HI> Burie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>Hindoos</HI> in general (not believing <HI>the resurrection of the flesh)</HI> burn the bodies of their dead near some Rivers (if they may with convenience) wherein they sow their ashes.</P>
<P>And there are another Sect, or sort of Hea∣thens living amongst them called <HI>Persees,</HI> which do neither of these; of whom, and how they bestow the bodies of their dead, you shall hear afterward.</P>
<P>The Widows of these <HI>Hindoos</HI> (first men∣tioned) such as have lived to keep company with their Husbands, for (as before) there is usually a good space of time 'twixt their wed∣ding and bedding. The Widows (I say) who have their Husbands separated from them by death, when they are very young, marry not again, but whither, or no this be generally ob∣served by them all I know not, but this I am sure of, that immediately after their Husbands are dead, they cut their Hair, and spend all their life following as Creatures neglected both by themselves, and others, whence to be free from shame, some of them are ambitious to die with Honour (as they esteem it) when their fiery
<PB N="323" REF="177"/>
love carries them to the flames (as they think) of Martyrdom, most willingly following the dead bodies of their Husbands unto the fire, and there imbracing, are burnt with them.</P>
<P>A better agreement in death than that of <HI>Eteocles</HI> and <HI>Polynices,</HI> the two <HI>Theban</HI> bro∣thers, of whom it is said that they were such deadly enemies while they were alive, that af∣ter, when both their bodies were burnt together in the same <HI>fiery Pile,</HI> the flame parted and would not mix in one, of which <HI>Statius</HI> thus:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Nec furiis post fata modus; flammaeque rebelles</HI></L>
<L><HI>Seditione Rogi.—</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>Whose rage not death could end, rebellious ire</L>
<L>Inflam'd to civil War their funeral fire.</L></Q>
<Q><L><HI>—Nec mors mihi finiit iras.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>Mine anger with my body shall not die,</L>
<L>But with thy Ghost, my Ghost shall battel trie.</L></Q>
<P>But those, which before I named, agree so well in life, that they will not be divided by death, where their flames unite together. And although the Woman, who thus burns with her Husband, doth this voluntarily, not by any compulsion (for the love of every Widow there is not thus fired) and though the poor Crea∣ture, who thus dies may return and live if she please, even then when she comes to the <HI>Pile,</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="178"/>
which immediately after turns her into ashes: yet she who is once thus resolved, never starts back from hir first firm and setled resolution, but goes on singing to her death, having taken some intoxicating thing to turn or disturb her brains; and then come to the place where she will needs die, she settles her self presently in the middest of that combustable substance pro∣vided to dispatch her, which fuel is placed in a round shallow trench, about two foot deep, made for that purpose near some River, or other water (as before) and though she have no bonds but her own strong affections to tie her unto those flames, yet she never offers to stir out of them. But</P>
<Q><L>Her breathlesse Husband then she takes</L>
<L>In foulded arms; this done she makes</L>
<L>Her humble sute to 'th flames to give</L>
<L>Her quick dispatch, she cannot live</L>
<L>Her honour dead. Her friends there come</L>
<L>Look on, as if't were, Martyrdom;</L>
<L>And with content are hit her led,</L>
<L>As once to view her marriage bed.</L></Q>
<P>And thus, she being joyfully accompanied unto the place of her dying by her Parents and other friends, and when all is fitted for this hellish Sacrifice, and the fire begins to burn; all which are there present shout, and make a
<PB N="325" REF="178"/>
continued noise so long as they observe her to stir, that the screeches of that poor tortured Creature may not be heard. Not much unlike the custom of the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> who, when <HI>they made their Children passe through the fire to Molech,</HI> caused certain <HI>Tabrets,</HI> or <HI>Drums</HI> to sound, that their cries might not be heard, whence the place was called <HI>Tophet, 2 King.</HI> 23. 10. which signifies a <HI>Drum,</HI> or <HI>Tabret.</HI></P>
<P>Now after their bodies are quite consumed, and lie mixed together in ashes, and those ashes begin to grow cold, some of them are gathered up by their nearest friends, and kept by them as choise Relicks, the rest are immediately sowen by the standers by upon the adjacent River, or water.</P>
<P>Alas poor wretches! what a hard Master do they serve, who puts them upon such unrea∣sonable services in the flower of their youth and strength, thus to become their own executio∣ners; to burn their own <HI>bones</HI> when they are full of <HI>marrow,</HI> and to waste their own <HI>breasts,</HI> when they are full of <HI>milk.</HI> Now Almighty God requires no such thing at his peoples hands, &amp; therefore it is by far the more strange to consider that the Devil should have such an abundance of servants in the World, and God so few.</P>
<P>But for those poor silly Souls, who <HI>sing</HI> them∣selves into the extremity of <HI>misery,</HI> &amp; thus mad∣ly
<PB N="326" REF="179"/>
go out of the World, through one fire into another, through <HI>flames</HI> that will not last long into <HI>everlasting burnings,</HI> and do it not out of necessity, but choise, led hereunto by their <HI>tempter</HI> and <HI>murderer,</HI> and consequently become so injurious and mercilesse to them∣selves▪ certainly they deserve much pity from others, who know not how to pity themselves. For <HI>nemo miserius misero non miserants scip∣sum.</HI> There are none so cruel as those, which are cruel, and pitilesse to themselves. But though (I say) there are some which thus throw away their own lives, yet if we consider those <HI>Hin∣doos</HI> in general we may further take notice.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the tendernesse of that people in pre∣serving the lives of all other infe∣riour Creatures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr they will not (if they can help it by any means) take, but on the contrary do what they can to preserve the lives of all inferiour Creatures, whence (as before I told you) they give large money to preserve the lives of their <HI>Kine</HI> (a reason for this you shall have after∣ward) and I have often observed, that when our <HI>English</HI> boyes there have out of wanton∣nesse been killing of Flies (there swarming in
<PB N="327" REF="179"/>
abundance) they would be very much troubled at it, and if they could not perswade them to suffer those poor Creatures to live, they would give them mony, or something else to forbear that (as they conceived) cruelty.</P>
<P>As for themselves (I mean a very great num∣ber of them) they will not deprive the most uselesse, and most offensive Creatures of life, not <HI>Snakes,</HI> and other venomous things that may kill them, saying, that it is their nature to do hurts, and they cannot help it, but as for themselves they further say, that God hath gi∣ven them reason to shun those Creatur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, but not liberty to destroy them.</P>
<P>And in order to this their conceit, the <HI>Ba∣nians</HI> (who are the most tender hearted in this case of all that people) have <HI>Spittles</HI> (as they say) on purpose to recover lame birds &amp; beasts.</P>
<P>Some ground for this their tendernesse hap∣pily proceeds from this consideration; that they cannot give life to the meanest of the sensible Creatures, and therefore think that they may not take the lives of any of them: for the poor∣est worm, which crawleth upon the face of the earth, <HI>tam vita vivit, quam Angelus,</HI> (as one of the ancients speaks) live for the present as much as the Angels, and cannot be willing to part with that life, and therefore they imagine that it is most injurious by violence to take it.</P>
<P>But (as I conceive) the most principal cause
<PB N="328" REF="180"/>
why they thus forbear to take the lives of in∣feriour Creatures, proceeds from their obedi∣ence unto a precept given them by one of their principal, and most highly esteemed Prophets and Law-givers they call <HI>Bremaw;</HI> others, they have in very high esteem, and the name of one of them is <HI>Ram,</HI> of another <HI>Permissar.</HI> I am ignorant of the names of others, and I con∣ceive that my Reader will not much care to know them. But for him they call <HI>Bremaw,</HI> they have received (as they say) many precepts, which they are carefull to observe, and the first of them. This</P>
<P><HI>Thou shalt not kill any living Creature what∣soever it be, having life in the same, for thou art a Creature, and so is it, thou art indued with life, and so is it, thou shalt not therefore spil the life of any of thy fellow-Creatures that live.</HI></P>
<P>Other <HI>precepts</HI> (they say) were delivered un∣to them by their Law-giver about their devoti∣ons, in their <HI>washings and worshippings</HI> where they are commanded.</P>
<P><HI>To observe times for fasting, and hours for watching, that they may be the better fitted for them.</HI></P>
<P>—Other directions they have about their <HI>festivals</HI> wherein they are required,</P>
<P><HI>To take their food moderately, in not pamper∣ing their bodies.</HI></P>
<P>—Concerning <HI>Charity</HI> they are further commanded.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="180"/>
<HI>To help the poor as far as they are possibly able.</HI></P>
<P>—Other precepts (they say) were given them likewise in charge; as</P>
<P><HI>Not to tell false tales, nor to utter any thing that is untrue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not to steal any thing from others, be it never so little.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not to defraud any by their cunning in bar∣gains, or contracts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not to oppresse any, when they have power to do it.</HI></P>
<P>Now all those particulars are observed by them with much strictnesse; and some of them are very good, having the impression of God upon them, but that scruple they make in for∣bearing the lives of the Creatures made for mens use, shews how that they have their dwel∣ing in the dark, which makes them by reason of their blindnesse to deny unto themselves that li∣berty, and <HI>Soveraignty</HI> which Almighty God hath given unto man <HI>over the beasts of the field, the fowles of the Air, and the fishes of the Sea,</HI> appointed for his food, given unto him for his <HI>service</HI> and <HI>sustenance,</HI> to serve him, and to seed him, but not to make havock and spoil of them.</P>
<P>However, the tendernesse of that people over inferiour Creatures shall one day rise up in judgement against all those, who make no
<PB N="330" REF="181"/>
scruple at all in taking the lives, not of sensible Creatures, but men, not legally to satisfie good and known Laws, but violently to please their cruel and barbarous lusts.</P>
<P>Histories are fill'd with many inhumane, and strange examples of this kinde. <HI>Valerius</HI> writes of <HI>Lucius Sylla</HI> (whose cruelty and thirst after bloud, made him a Monster of mankinde, a very Prodigy of Nature) that when he had cau∣sed some thousands of men to be put to death, or (more properly) to be murdered in one day, he presently gave command that this monstrous fact of his should be recorded, least the memory of so honourable an action (for so he call'd in) might be forgotten.</P>
<P>He kill'd a Gentleman of <HI>Rome</HI> at the same time for not enduring the sight of an innocent man of quality, whom he saw causelesly mur∣dered. Never (saith the Author) was it heard of before, that pity should be punished, and that it should be thought a Capital offence to be∣hold a Murder with grief.</P>
<P>For that <HI>Sylla,</HI> it might have been said of him as it was afterward of <HI>Nero,</HI> that he was a Creature made up of dirt and bloud, a Mon∣ster set upon mischief, who had so much ma∣lice and cruelty in his Nature (as any other may have left in his bloud) that <HI>Valerius</HI> writes thus further of him, <HI>ut in dubio esset Syll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne prior, an iracundia Syll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sit extinct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that it was
<PB N="331" REF="181"/>
a question whither himself, or anger were first extinguished, most strange and turbulent per∣turbations and storms, o anger, and malice, and mischief, <HI>quando ir a mortalium debet esse mor∣talis</HI> (as <HI>Lactantius</HI> well spake) when the an∣ger of mortal men should be mortal like them∣selves.</P>
<P>And so most <HI>barbarous and cruel</HI> are all they whatsoever they be, who have their hearts (so bound and confirm'd as it were with sinews of iron) that they delight in nothing so much as in the <HI>slaughter of men</HI> whatsoever they be, whither strangers, or brethren, and then make their boasts and brags, I have knockt so many on the head, saith one, and I have kill'd so ma∣ny saith another, and I so many saith a third, and others so many, and so many, which clear∣ly shews that <HI>they are Children of their Father the Devil, who was a murderer from the be∣ginning:</HI> for his language is ever in their mouths, <HI>ure, seca, occide,</HI> burn, cut, kill, do execution, and take no pity, spare not, sparo none, whether strangers, or known persons, old, or young, men, women, children, brethren, or whosoever else comes and crosseth them in their way, as it was in the dayes of that monstrous <HI>Sylla</HI> before named, when
<Q><PB N="332" REF="182"/>
<L>Gray-heads, young Orphans, Virgins, pregnant wives,</L>
<L>All died: 't was crime enough that they had lives:</L></Q></P>
<P>That <HI>Empresse</HI> was of a far better minde, who wisely advertised her husband, sitting and playing at Tables, &amp; minding his Game more than the Prisoners before him, on whom he pronounced the sentence of death: his wife (I say) thus spake unto him as <HI>Aelian</HI> reports, <HI>non est vita hominum talorum ludus,</HI> &amp;c. the life of man is not as a Game at Tables, where a <HI>woodden-man</HI> is taken away by a blot, and thrown aside, and after taken again into the play, and there is no hurt done; but the life of a living man, once lost is irrecoverable.</P>
<P>When <HI>Vedius Pollio</HI> a <HI>Roman,</HI> at a Supper provided for <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperour, would have <HI>drown'd</HI> his servant, because he had bro∣ken a cup of <HI>Christal,</HI> the Emperour (though an Heathen) withheld him, and controuled him in these words (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> reports) saying, <HI>Homo cujuscunque conditionis quatenus homo, &amp;c.</HI> a man of what condition so ever he be, if for no other cause, yet because he is a man, is more to be valued than all the Crystal cups in the world. And doubtlesse he deserves not the name of a man, who knows not how to va∣lue a man.</P>
<P>But how is mankinde in these last ages of
<PB N="333" REF="182"/>
the world become degenerate, and wilde from that which Nature first shaped it unto. For <HI>man</HI> was made in the beginning to <HI>man,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> was made to <HI>Aron,</HI> Ex. 4. 16. <HI>in some sense a God,</HI> for <HI>succour</HI> and <HI>comfort:</HI> but how contrary to this rule do most men walk; so that we may justly complain with that noble and virtuous French-man <HI>Philep Morney,</HI> saying, what is more rare amongst <HI>men</HI> than to finde a <HI>man,</HI> that is, (as he interprets himself) amongst men, how many beasts are there for want of the use of reason, and for not using reason well, how many Devils. Lions, (saith <HI>Plini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)</HI> fight not against Lions, <HI>Serpents</HI> bite not Serpents, but the most mischief man sustains comes from man.</P>
<P>Thou art deceived (saith <HI>Seneca)</HI> if thou givest credit unto the looks of those that meet thee, who have the faces of men, but the qua∣lities of wilde beasts. Some like the <HI>Crocodiles</HI> of <HI>Nilus</HI> that can flatter and betray, weep and murder, cry and kill. Oh how hath mankinde in these latter ages justified the madness of the most savage and untractable beasts, and steel'd their affections with more cruelty, than ever Lions, or Serpents could learn in the wildernes.</P>
<P>But certainly that crying clamouring sin of bloud, or murther, unlesse it be washed away with a floud of tears, issuing from a bleeding, and a broken heart, and died into another co∣lour
<PB N="334" REF="183"/>
by the bloud of <HI>Christ,</HI> will in conclusion bring woe and misery enough upon them that shed it. For there was never any drop of inno∣cent bloud spilt upon the earth, from the bloud of righteous <HI>Abel</HI> to this present hour, or that shall be shed so long as there are men, and ma∣lice, and mischief in the world, but it swells as big as the <HI>Ocean Sea</HI> in the eyes of God, and cannot be washed away by all the waters therein. And further, neither the heat of the Sun, nor the dust of the ground shall ever be able to drie, and drink it up till it be either avenged▪ or pardoned; unlesse the earth and heavens, and all that are therein can be bribed to keep silence, and to take no notice thereof.</P>
<P>Without all doubt, <HI>when God shall make in∣quisition for bloud, he will remember:</HI> for <HI>he that bottles up the tears of his poor people, cannot forget their bloud.</HI> Whence it comes to passe by the righteous judgement of Almighty God, that they, <HI>who delight in bloud,</HI> have usually enough of it before they die, or if <HI>bloud do not touch bloud</HI> for the present, it will deny a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peace after the fact committed. <HI>Had</HI> Zim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>peace; who slew his Master?</HI> 2 King. 9 31. no he had no peace, no more have any guilty of that sin, if their consciences be not for the pre∣sent <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oof'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over:</HI> if the mouth of them be not for the present <HI>bung'd</HI> up.

the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were smitten, all their waters in their Rivers, Ponds, and Pools, as in their Ves∣sels of wood &amp; stone were changed into bloud: So in the minde and conscience of a murtherer, there usually remains <HI>a plague of bloud;</HI> His eyes shall behold no other colour but <HI>Sanguine,</HI> as if the air were died into it; The visions of his head in the night shall cast a <HI>boul of bloud in his face,</HI> all the cogitations and thoughts of his heart shall overflow with the remembrance of that bloud he hath spilt. The consideration of which, (methinks) should be enough to trou∣ble and affright men that lie under the guilt of this sin, if they fear either guilt, or conscience, which will first, or last fly in their faces.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> writing <HI>de serâ numinis vindictâ</HI> of the late but sure revenges executed upon men by divine justice, hath this story of the <HI>Del∣phians,</HI> who made no scruple to murder <HI>Aesop</HI> amongst them, but after this when they were most grievously plagued by variety of heavy judgements, they, who had imbrued their hands in his bloud, walked up and down in all the publick assemblies of <HI>Greece,</HI> and caused this to be proclaimed by noise of <HI>Criars,</HI> that whosoever would, should be avenged on them <HI>for Aesops death.</HI> They believing themselves, the procurers of those plagues which were then upon them. <HI>Deus patiens redditor,</HI> God is a patient rewarder, whose revenges are slow, but

<P>'Tis sad to consider that Heathens (as before was observed) should have so much tendernesse in their Nature, and any bearing the names of Christians so much cruelty: that Heathens should make so much scruple in taking away the lives of base inferiour Creatures, of those which are not onely uselesse but offensive, and men called Christians so forward by wayes of violence to cut off the lives of men, never▪ en∣quiring into the justice of their quarrel, but the rate of their pay, and (as if their own lives, and the bloud of others were not worth the valuing) will adventure to kill, or be kill'd for a dayes wages. Thus making havock of men as fearfully made, as dearly redeemed, as ten∣derly cherished, &amp; brought up as themselves yet <HI>occidendi causa occidunt,</HI> they kill, because they take pleasure in killing, and are no more trou∣bled at the death of a man, than if a Dog had fallen before them.</P>
<P>'Tis true that Lions will tear, and Dogs will bark and bite, and Serpents will sting, because it is in their nature so to do; yet men, Christians
<PB N="337" REF="184"/>
must do otherwise; and not make the slaugh∣ters of men, of multitudes of people professing <HI>Christ,</HI> delightfull arguments of their ordina∣ry discourse, or Table talk, as if it were a rela∣tion that had pleasure in it, as if there were no difference 'twixt the cutting down of men, and the mowing of Straw and Stubble.</P>
<P>I confesse that when men have an imme∣diate commission from God, to execute ven∣geance on those he would have destroyed, they may do execution with boldnesse, without pity, or regret: for it is as great a fault to spare when God bids destroy (for he wrongs the in∣nocent, who spares the gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty) for which very thing <HI>Saul</HI> payes dear, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.) as to de∣stroy when God bids spare. The <HI>Israelites</HI> had such a Commission often granted, and renewed, for the rooting out of those Nations, which God would have grubb'd up root and branch, and then they were to destroy without pity. But afterward that people, because they did so much abuse their prosperity, and successe, and after both, their peace, they perish themselves by the Sword of War. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had many-many warnings; but would not take them, <HI>be∣fore the woe took hold of it.</HI> And therefore after all those monitions, <HI>Titus</HI> the Son of <HI>Vespa∣tian</HI> the Emperour was made instrumental to fulfill those many Prophesies, which threatned <HI>Jerusalems</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> overthrow. But that Com∣mander,
<PB N="338" REF="185"/>
and Conqueror, though a stranger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an adversary, and a profest enemy to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and sent to destroy them, when he saw (as <HI>Josephus</HI> reports) the spoyl and slaughter which fell up∣on that wofull, and most miserable City, he calls his Gods to witnesse that he was exceed∣ingly troubled at it. <HI>He that is glad at cala∣mity shall not be unpunished,</HI> Prov. 17. 5. And if an Heathen, a forraign enemy sent to destroy, could take no pleasure in executing of punish∣ment, though upon enemies, but the contrary: men which enjoy the light, should be by much more troubled, in the beholding of slaughters, which happen among themselves, or brethren. And therefore <HI>Tully</HI> writing to <HI>Atticus</HI> speaks exceeding wisely in telling him thus, <HI>extremum est malorum omnium bells civilis victoria.</HI> His reason, because men having done much mi∣schief already in those unnatural engagements, are flesh't and heartened to go on, and to do more mischief still. Hence it was that the very Heathens were not wont to make any triumphs for victories gain'd in their Civil Wars, as <HI>Lu∣can</HI> speaks.
<Q><L>Bella geri placuit nullos habitura Trium∣phos.</L></Q></P>
<P>And there is very much to this purpose in that sad, but very remarkable story of the <HI>Isra∣elites</HI> and <HI>Benjamites,</HI> as we may observe in the
<PB N="339" REF="185"/>
of <HI>Judges,</HI> Chapters 20. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. Some <HI>Benja∣mites</HI> there at <HI>Gebiah</HI> had committed an abo∣minable wickednesse, the rest of that Tribe, in∣stead of <HI>punishing,</HI> did <HI>patronize</HI> it, and chose rather to <HI>die</HI> in the <HI>resisting</HI> of <HI>justice</HI> than <HI>live,</HI> and <HI>prosper</HI> in the <HI>furthering</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>It is one of the mad principles of wicked∣nesse, that when men have once resolv'd to do a thing, be it never so bad, and to say they will do it, it is very great weaknesse to relent, therefore they will chuse to suffer, to die rather then yield, or go back from their resolutions, thinking that causes, whatsoever they be when they are once undertaken, must be upheld, although with bloud. And from this false ground, the <HI>Ben∣jamits</HI> there put themselvesin Arms, and will be <HI>Champions</HI> to defend the <HI>leud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of their <HI>brethren,</HI> and make themselves worse by the <HI>ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting</HI> of a monstrous sin, than the others were by the <HI>commission</HI> thereof. Because the last was done upon resolution, and so probably was not the other. Now that no man may conclude a cause therefore good, because the successe is so, the <HI>Tribes of Israel</HI> that went against the <HI>Benjamits</HI> had by far the better of the cause: But the <HI>Benjamits</HI> for the present the better in their success, for the wickednesse of <HI>Benjamin</HI> sped better for a time, than the hone∣sty of <HI>Israel.</HI> Twise was the better part foil'd by the lesse and worse, the good cause was sent
<PB N="340" REF="186"/>
back with shame: The evil returned with vi∣ctory and Triumph. But wickednesse could never brag of any long prosperity. <HI>The trium∣phing of the wicked is short.</HI> And wickednesse cannot complain of the lack of payment, for still God is <HI>even</HI> with it at the last, as we may observe in the story of those <HI>Benjamits,</HI> who in conclusion were made to pay extreamly dear for their sin. In whose example we may take notice, that the <HI>retaliations</HI> of the Lord are <HI>sure</HI> and <HI>just.</HI> But after all this, when the rest of the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> (being so highly provo∣ked) had slain such a very great number of the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> almost to the utter ruine of their <HI>Tribe,</HI> for acting and abetting such a mon∣strous wickednesse, observe how the rest of <HI>Is∣rael</HI> behaved themselves towards their <HI>Breth∣ren,</HI> they did not rejoyce, and make Triumphs for that their victory▪ but <HI>they weep over their dead bodies,</HI> Judg. 21. 2. and study how that breach a mong the <HI>Benjamites</HI> (which their sin and provocation had enforced the rest of <HI>Israel</HI> to make) might be made up again.</P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Oded</HI> gave good counsel (in a case which was something parallel to this) and it was well followed, 2 <HI>Chr.</HI> 28. for when they of <HI>Samaria</HI> had taken a very great number of their brethren of <HI>Judah</HI> &amp; <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Captives▪ <HI>two hundred thousand, and much spoil,</HI> and were carrying it, and them to <HI>Samaria;</HI> the Prophet
<PB N="341" REF="186"/>
(I say) gave this counsel, that they should not strip, and starve, but put cloathing on their loins, and shoes on their feet, and meat, and drink in their bellies, and send them home again; and so they did.</P>
<P>There are very many who walk quite con∣trary to these rules, and dare do as those wic∣ked ones (mentioned in the second Chapter of the book of wisdom) saying, <HI>let us oppresse and let our strength be the rule of Justice,</HI> as if there were no power, either in Earth, or Hea∣ven to contradict them. But however let o∣thers, who observe the courses of Gods Provi∣dence, and withall see <HI>the oppression of the poor, and the violent perverting of judgement and justice in a Province,</HI> not marvel at the matter: <HI>for he that is higher than the highest regard∣eth, and there be higher than they.</HI></P>
<P>In that Parable, <HI>Luke</HI> 16. Dogs are men∣tioned, and why so? that their tongues might condemne the mercilesse bowels of their Ma∣ster, who shewed pity in their kinde. When their Master had no Compassion on the poor <HI>Lazar,</HI> he not considering that there is a mer∣cy, a pity, and a care due unto the most despi∣cable piece of humanity. <HI>Frustra misericor∣diam petit, qui misericordiam non facit;</HI> in vain shall they one day hope for mercy and pi∣ty that will not now exercise it.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly there is nothing becomes power
<PB N="342" REF="187"/>
and greatnesse better than bowels, and inwards of pity and mercy. These make the faces of men in power to shine, and themselves to re∣semble God, who is most properly called <HI>opti∣mum, maximum,</HI> first by the name of his good∣nesse, and then by the name of his greatnesse, first by the name of his mercy, and then by the name of his might.</P>
<P>But the ignorance of those <HI>Indians</HI> (before spoken off) makes them more pitifull than they need to be: and if they had knowledge to make doubt of) and to scruple other things as they should, I might have spared my next <HI>Se∣ction,</HI> which will acquaint my Reader by tel∣ling him further.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of other strange and groundlesse, and ve∣ry grosse opinions, proceeding from the blacknesse, and darknesse of ignorance in that people.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALl error in the World proceeds either from ignorance (commonly joyned with pride) or else from wilfulnesse. This is most true as in natural, and moral, so in spiritual things. For as knowledge softens &amp; sweetens mens manners: so it enricheth their mindes:
<PB N="243" REF="187" MS="y"/>
which knowledge is certainly a most divine, a very excellent thing, otherwise our first Parents would never have been so ambitious of it. This makes a man here to live twice, or to en∣joy here a double life in respect of him that wants it. But for this knowledge it certainly must be esteemed better, or worse, by how much the object of this knowledge is worse, or better. Now the best object of this knowledge is a right understanding, and knowledge of the true God, which that people wants.</P>
<P>For there is <HI>scientia contristans</HI> (as <HI>Bernard</HI> speaks) a sad, an unquiet, an unpeaceable, and an unsatisfying knowledge, as to know that there is a God, (for so this people do) and to be ignorant, (as this people, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llions more are) to serve him aright, and how to make him their God. As for men to know that they are sin∣ners, and not to know this unto amendment of life: as to know that there is an Heaven and not to know how to attain it. As to know that there is an Hell, and not to know how to avoid it. And more particularly for such as professe Christ, to know that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> died for sinners, and to be ignorant how to apply a Plaster of his bloud, and merits unto the hurts of their poor wounded Souls &amp; further, though knowledge be so excellent; for any, to seek af∣ter the <HI>Tree of knowledge</HI> more than the <HI>Tree of life,</HI> is a most uncomfortable search.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="188"/>
Now touching this people, they are altoge∣ther ignorant of God, as they ought to know him, and they have no learning amongst them, but as much as enables them to write and to read what they have written and they having no insight into the reasons and causes of things (I mean the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uder sort, both of the <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles)</HI> when they observe things which are not very ordinary, as when they see any Eclipses, but especially of the Moon (hap∣pily some of them <HI>sacrificing to her,</HI> and cal∣ling her <HI>the Queen of Heaven,</HI> as those Idola∣ters did, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44. 18.) they make a very great stir and noise, bemoaning her much, which helps (as they conceive) to free, and bring her out of it. <HI>Juvenal</HI> observing that custom, (which ap∣pears to be very ancient among the Heathens) re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roves a very brawling clamorous Woman in his sixt Satyre thus:
<Q><L>Una, laboranti poterit succurrere Luna.</L></Q></P>
<P>That she made noise enough to deliver the Moon out of an Eclipse.</P>
<P>Their ignorance in this, as in many many other things is much to be pitied: as the know∣ledge and learning of many others, which (by their not improving of it) is to them as the letters which <HI>Uriah sometimes carried against himself, it condemnes the bearer.</HI></P>
<P>But though the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> or <HI>Heathens</HI> there
<PB N="345" REF="188"/>
have no learning, yet they want not opinions, for their divided hearts are there distracted into <HI>four-score,</HI> and <HI>four</HI> several <HI>Sects,</HI> each differing from others, very much in opinion about their irreligion, which might fill a man, even full of wonder, that doth not consider, how that <HI>Sa∣tan,</HI> who is the author of division, is the seducer of them all.</P>
<P>Those many Sects (as I conceive among them) consist of people there of several trades, occupations, and conditions of life, which seve∣ral sorts of people (as before I observed) marry into their own tribes, and so unite and keep to∣gether amongst themselves, that they had not much correspondency with any other people. These without doubt have several wayes of worship within themselves, which makes them so seperate from others, as that they will not eat with any, but those of their own Tribes.</P>
<P>For <HI>Heathens,</HI> that have neither light nor guide to be thus divided, and to live in dark∣nesse hath not so much wonder in it, but for Christians, who have been in the <HI>valley of visi∣ons</HI> thus to separate, ministers matter of won∣der, or pity, nay, of both. And for us of this Nation, if we still continue to multiply opini∣ons in Religion as we have begun▪ which God forbid) we shall enlarge the proverb, that if a man have lost his Religion and cannot finde it, either in <HI>Poland,</HI> nor yet in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> let him seek for it in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="189"/>
The illiterare Priests of all that people for the generality of them are called <HI>Bramins,</HI> who derive themselves from <HI>Bramon,</HI> whom (they say) was one of the first men that inhabited the World, and after the sin of that first World brought the Flood: the race of that <HI>Bramon</HI> (whose very name they highly reverence) was continued in <HI>Bremaw,</HI> who (as they say) out-lived that deluge, and is honoured by them likewise as one of their great Prophets &amp; Law-givers.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Bramins</HI> (as I conceive) are they, which the ancient stories call <HI>Brachmanes,</HI> but with this difference, that those <HI>Brachmanes</HI> were accounted learned men, for the learning of those times wherein they lived: But those <HI>Bramins</HI> are a very silly, sottish, and an igno∣rant sort of people, who are so inconstant in their <HI>principles,</HI> as that they scarce know, what the particulars are which they hold, and maintain as truths.</P>
<P>As anciently amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> their <HI>Priest∣hond</HI> is <HI>hereditary,</HI> for all those <HI>Bramins</HI> Sons are Priests, and they all take the daughters of <HI>Bramins</HI> to be their wives. (Of which some∣thing before.)</P>
<P>They have little Churches they call <HI>Pagode,</HI> standing near, or under their green Trees, built round; But as their ancient <HI>Brachmanes</HI> were said not to èndure, these on the contrary have
<PB N="347" REF="189"/>
Images in their <HI>Pagods</HI> made in monstrous shapes, but for what end they have them, I know not.</P>
<P>Now, from the manner of those <HI>Heathens,</HI> which I believe hath been for many-many years retained in their Idolatrous worships. I conceive that the <HI>Jews</HI> long ago borrowed that unwarrantable custom of worshipping God in <HI>Groves,</HI> or <HI>under green Trees.</HI></P>
<P>Both men and women before they go to their devotions (which are very frequently per∣formed) wash their bodies, and keep off all their cloaths, but the covering of modesty till they have done, led hereunto by a precept (as they say) commanded them to be perform'd by their Law-giver <HI>Bremaw,</HI> which requires them dayly <HI>to observe their times of devotion expres∣sed by their washings, and worshippings, &amp; prayer to God; which must be all done with purity of hearts.</HI></P>
<P>And it is the manner of this people before they take their food to wash their bodies, then (which I much observed while we lived in Tents) they make a little Circle upon the ground, which they seem to consecrate, after which they sit down within that Compasse, and eat what they have provided; and if any come within that Circle before they have ended their meal, they presently quit the place, and leave their food behinde them.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="190"/>
That outward washing (as this people think) avails very much to their cleansing from sin, not unlike the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who were all for the out-side of Religion, and would not eat <HI>with unwashen hands,</HI> Marc. 7. 2. unlesse they washed themselves up to the Elbows, (as <HI>Theophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act</HI> observes) hence those <HI>Hindoos</HI> ascribe a cer∣tain Divinity unto Rivers, but above all to that Famous River <HI>Ganges,</HI> whither they flock day∣ly in Troups, that there they may wash them∣selves; and the nearer they can come to the head of that River, the more virtue they be∣lieve is in the water. After they have thus washed, they throw pieces of Gold, or Silver (according to their devotion and ability) into that River, and so depart from it.</P>
<P>Thus Reader thou hast somewhat of the car∣riages of this people in life. Now after death some of them talk of <HI>Elyzian fields</HI> (such as the Poets dream'd of) to which their Souls must passe over a <HI>Stix,</HI> or <HI>Acheron,</HI> and there take new bodies. Others of them think that ere long the World will have an end, after which they shall live here again on a new earth. Some other wilde conceivings of this people follow afterward.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Bramins</HI> have told me that they ac∣knowledge one God, whom they describe with a thousand eyes, with a thousand hands, and as many feet, that thereby they may expresse his
<PB N="349" REF="190"/>
power, as being all eye to see, and all foot to follow, and all hand to smite offenders. The consideration whereof makes that people very exact in the performances of all moral duties, following close the light of Nature in their dealings with men, most carefully observing that Royal Law, <HI>in doing nothing to others, but what they would be well contented to suffer from others.</HI></P>
<P>Those <HI>Bramins</HI> talk of two books, which no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long after the Creation, when the World be∣gan to be peopled (they say) were delivered by Almighty God to <HI>Bramon</HI> (before spoken of) one of which books (they say) containing very high and secret, and Mysterious things was sealed up &amp; might not be opened; the other to be read, but onely by the <HI>Bramins,</HI> or <HI>Priests.</HI> And this book, thus to be read came after (as they further say) into the hands of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> (of whom likewise something before) and by him it was communicated unto <HI>Ram,</HI> and <HI>Per∣missar,</HI> two other fam'd Prophets amongst them, which those Heathens do likewise ex∣ceedingly magnifie, as they do some others, whose names I have not. Now that book which they call the <HI>Shester,</HI> or the book of their written word, hath been transcribed in all ages ever since by the <HI>Bramins,</HI> out of which they deliver precepts unto the people.</P>
<P>They say that there are seven <HI>Orbi,</HI> above
<PB N="350" REF="191"/>
which is the seat of God and that God knows not small and petty things, or if he do, regards them not.</P>
<P>There have been <HI>Philosophers</HI> of the like minde, who madly thought that Almighty God had no regard of humane affairs. For which very thing <HI>Tully,</HI> though an Heathen, doth most highly condemne them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peripateticks</HI> housed the Providence of God above the Moon, and thought that it had no descent beneath the Circle thereof, to intend inferiour things and businesses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Atheists</HI> in the Psalm, who say <HI>that there is no God,</HI> inferre from hence, <HI>how can God see?</HI> what do the <HI>Epicures</HI> in <HI>Job</HI> say lesse; or <HI>Eliphaz</HI> speaking in their names, <HI>Job 22. how can God know? can he judge through the dark clouds? the clouds hide him that he cannot see,</HI> and <HI>Chap.</HI> 24. 14, 15. he brings in the mur∣derer and adulterer, acting their parts with much boldnesse, confidence, and presumption, &amp; upon this false ground <HI>that no eyes see them,</HI> for if they did believe the contrary, then cer∣tainly they would not dare to do what they do, which shews that there is a very <HI>Atheisme</HI> in the hearts of most men, which makes them not afraid to do that in the presence of an <HI>all∣seeing God,</HI> which for fear, or shame they durst not do in the sight of a <HI>little Childe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Averroes,</HI> a Spanish <HI>Phisician</HI> (that he
<PB N="351" REF="191"/>
might seem to be mad with reason) by reason goes about to exempt, and with-draw smaller things from the sight and providence of God, as if it were most injurious to bring down the Ma∣jesty of God so low, thinking that the know∣ledge and understanding of God would be∣come vile, if it were abased by taking notice of mean and inferiour objects.</P>
<P>A very strange opinion, as if a <HI>looking-glasse</HI> were deformed, because it represents <HI>deformi∣ties:</HI> Or the <HI>Beams</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> defiled, because they fall upon <HI>dunghils</HI> and other filthy places, or the <HI>Providence</HI> of God vilified, <HI>who though he hath his dwelling so high, yet he abaseth him∣self to behold the things in heaven and in earth,</HI> Psal. 113. 6.</P>
<P><HI>As he spake the word in the</HI> beginning, <HI>so all things were made,</HI> Gen. 1. thus ever since he <HI>sustaineth, and beareth up all things by the power of that word,</HI> Heb. 1. His <HI>Creation</HI> was the <HI>Mother</HI> to bring things <HI>forth;</HI> his <HI>Provi∣dence</HI> the <HI>Nurse</HI> to bring them <HI>up.</HI> His Crea∣tion a short <HI>Providence,</HI> his <HI>Providence</HI> a per∣petual <HI>Creation;</HI> The first setting up the <HI>frame</HI> of the house, the second looking to the stand∣ing▪ and <HI>reparations</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>And therefore I will bring in <HI>Tully</HI> again to gain-say, and condemne those forenamed mad opinions, who (in his first book <HI>de naturâ deorum)</HI> tells us, that the Providence of God
<PB N="352" REF="192"/>
reacheth, <HI>usque ad Apium, For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>que per∣fectionem,</HI> to the husbanding of <HI>Bees</HI> and <HI>Pis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> And in his eight book on the same sub∣ject, (where speaking against the <HI>Epioures</HI> and <HI>Atheists</HI> of that age) he saith, <HI>curiosus, &amp; plenus negotii Deus▪</HI> that God is a curious God, exquisite in all things, and full of businesse, So far he an Heathen could see, and so much say.</P>
<P>But a Christian that knows more, can speak further, that God is not a carelesse, an impro∣vident God, or a God to halves and in part, above and not beneath the Moon, as the <HI>Sy∣rians</HI> dreamed, upon the mountains, and not in the valleys; but he is a God in lesser, as well as in greater matters: Who beholds at one view all places, and all persons, and all things. And as <HI>our times are in Gods hands:</HI> so he takes notice of every thing done by us in every minute and moment of our time; He know∣ing all things not as they appear, but are, <HI>sim∣plici notitia,</HI> (as the Schools speak) with a sure, certain exact knowledge. Thus he takes no∣tice of every sin that is committed, and of eve∣ry circumstance in sinning. He saw the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins of the whole World in the book of his eternity, long before the foundations of the World were laid. He sees them in every mans breast before his hands commit them. <HI>I knew thee</HI> (saith God) <HI>before thou camest forth of the Womb;</HI> Jer. 1. 5. And <HI>God tells</HI> Israel, <HI>that he knew what
<PB N="349" REF="192" MS="y"/>
they meant to do long before they came out of the land of</HI> Egypt: the consideration whereof may curb, and confound all those that say <HI>God shall not see.</HI></P>
<P>This Providence of God did reach <HI>to the handfull of Meal, and the cruise of Oil in the poor Widows house,</HI> 2 King. 4. And so it reach∣eth to the <HI>Calving of Hindes;</HI> to the <HI>feeding of young Lions and Ravens;</HI> to the <HI>falling of Spar∣rows on the ground;</HI> to the <HI>numbring of our hairs,</HI> as to every thing beside.</P>
<P>But to return again to that people, the <HI>Hin∣doos</HI> I spake of, and these circumscribe God to place, and further conceit that he may be seen, but as in a <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st afar</HI> off, but not <HI>near.</HI></P>

<P>Thus much from <HI>Ovid</HI> of that <HI>Pythago∣rian</HI> fancy, which that untaught people come up very near unto, thinking that all the Souls, both of men and women after they leave their bodies make their repose in other Creatures, and those Souls (as they imagine) are best lodged that go into <HI>Kine,</HI> which (in
<PB N="352" REF="194"/>
their opinion) are the best of all sensible Crea∣tures; &amp; therefore (as before) they give year∣ly large sums of mony unto the <HI>Mogol</HI> to re∣deem them from slaughter. And this people further conceit, that the Souls of the wicked go in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>vile</HI> Creatures, as the Souls of Gluttons and Drunkards into Swin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. So the Souls of the voluptuous and incontinent into Monkies &amp; Apes. Thus the Souls of the furious revenge∣full cruel people into Lions, Wolves, Tygres, as into other beasts of prey. So the Souls of the envious into Serpents, and so into other Crea∣tures according to peoples qualities and dispo∣sitions, while they lived successively from one to another of the same kinde, <HI>ad infinitum</HI> for ever and ever, by consequence they believing the immortality of the world. And upon that same mad and groundlesse phansie, probably they further believe, that the Souls of froward, peevish, and teachy women go into Waspes; and that there is never a silly Fly, but (if they may be credited) carries about it some Souls (happily they think of light women) and will not be perswaded out of their wilde concei∣vings, so incorrigib <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are their sottish errours.</P>
<P>The day of rest which those <HI>Hindoos</HI> ob∣serve as a <HI>Sabboth</HI> is <HI>Thursday,</HI> as the <HI>Maho∣metans Friday.</HI> Many Festivals they have which they keep solemnely, and Pilgrimages, the most famous briefly spoken of before in
<PB N="253" REF="194" MS="y"/>
those short descriptions of <HI>Nagraiot,</HI> and <HI>Syba</HI> observed in my first section.</P>
<P>Now there are a race of other Heathens (I named before) living amongst those <HI>Hindoos,</HI> which in many things differ very much from them, they are called <HI>Persees,</HI> who (as they say) originally came out of <HI>Persia,</HI> about that time <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his followers gave Laws to the <HI>Persians,</HI> and imposed a new Religion on them, which these <HI>Persees</HI> not enduring left their Countrey, and came and setled themselves in <HI>East-India,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Guzarat,</HI> where the most part of them still continue (though there are some of them likewise in other parts of <HI>India)</HI> but where ever they live they confine themselves strictly to their own <HI>Tribe,</HI> or <HI>Sect.</HI></P>
<P>For their Habits, they are clad like the other people of that Empire, but they shave not their hair close as the other do, but suffer their bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s to grow long.</P>
<P>Their profession is for the generality all kinds of husbandry, imploying themselves very much in sowing and setting of Herbs; in planting and dressing of Vines, &amp; <HI>Palmeeto,</HI> or <HI>Toddy,</HI> Trees, as in planting and husbanding all other Trees bearing fruit, and indeed they are a very indu∣strious people, and so are very many of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Hindoos</HI> (as before observed) and they do all very well in doing so, and in this a due, and
<PB N="354" REF="195"/>
deserved commendation belongs unto them. For,</P>
<P>There is no condition whatsoever can pri∣viledge a foulded arm. Our first Parents be∣fore their fall <HI>were put into the Garden of</HI> E∣den <HI>to dress it.</HI> Certainly if idlenesse had been better than labour, they had never been com∣manded to do work but they must labour in their estate of innocency, because they were hap∣py, and much more we in our sinfull lost estate that we may be so. It was a Law given be∣fore the Law, <HI>that man should eat bread by the sweat of his brows,</HI> and it is a Gospel-precept too <HI>that he, who will not work, should not eat. The sluggard desireth and hath nothing</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon)</HI> because he doth nothing but desire, and therefore his desires do him no good, <HI>be∣cause his hands refuse to labour.</HI> That <HI>body</HI> therefore well deserves to pine and starve with∣out pity, when two able hands cannot feed one mouth.</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t further for those <HI>Persees</HI> they use their li∣berty in meats &amp; drinks, to take of them what they please, but because they would not give offence, either to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> or <HI>Banians,</HI> or to other <HI>Hindoos</HI> amongst whom they live, they abstain from eating Beef, or Swines flesh.</P>
<P>It is their usual manner to eat alone, as for every one of them to drink in his own Cup, and this is a means (as they think) to keep them∣selves
<PB N="355" REF="195"/>
more pure, for if they should eat with others, they are afraid that they might parti∣cipate of some uncleannesse by them.</P>
<P>Alas poor Creatures that do not at all un∣derstand themselves, and their most miserable condition, <HI>for to them that are defiled, and un∣believing is nothing pure.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I observed before, the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> there are very strict in this particular; so that they will not eat with any mixt com∣pany, and many of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> not eat with one another. And this hath been an ancient custom among Heathens. <HI>It is said,</HI> Gen. 43. 32. <HI>that the</HI> Egyptians <HI>might not eat bread with the</HI> Hebrews, <HI>for that was an abomination to the</HI> Egyptians, for this very reason it was, that the women of <HI>Samaria</HI> spake thus unto our <HI>blessed Saviour,</HI> John 4. 9. <HI>how is it that thou being a</HI> Jew <HI>askest water of me, which am a woman of</HI> Samaria, <HI>for the</HI> Jews <HI>have no deal∣ings with the</HI> Samaritanes. But without doubt that forbearance, or shy-ness to eat, one man with another can fetch no ground, either from religion, or reason, if it could, Peter <HI>would ne∣ver have eaten with the Gentiles,</HI> Gal. 12. Nor our blessed Saviour <HI>with Publicans &amp; sinners,</HI> at which the <HI>Scribes &amp; Pharisees</HI> take very much exception, <HI>Marc.</HI> 2. 16. No man as a man is to be accounted <HI>common, or unclean,</HI> Act. 10. 28. and a man shall do much better, who eats and
<PB N="356" REF="196"/>
drinks with a <HI>sober Heathen,</HI> than to keep company with a <HI>debaucht</HI> drunken sensual man, though he call himself a Christian, eat∣ing and drinking with him <HI>such things as please him,</HI> by being his companion in his Riot and excesse.</P>
<P>For those <HI>Persees,</HI> further they believe that there is but one God, who made all things, and hath a Soveraign power over all. They talk much of <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and of other evil Spirits, but they say, that those and all Devils besides are kept so under, and in awe by two good <HI>Angels,</HI> that have power over them, as that they cannot hurt or do the least mischief, with∣out their leave, and licence.</P>
<P>As many of the <HI>Hindoos</HI> ascribe to much unto water, (as before) so these to fire and the reason of it is this, because they have had this tradition from many ages &amp; generations past, that their great Law-giver, whom they call <HI>Zertoost</HI> was rapt up into Heaven, and there had fire delivered unto him, which he brought down thence, and he ever after commanded his followers to worship it and so they do, and further they love any thing that resembles fire, as the Sun and Moon, and therefore when they pray in the day time they look towards the sun, and so towards the Moon in their night-devo∣tions, and from that so over-high esteem they have of fire, they keep fires continually burn∣ing
<PB N="357" REF="196"/>
in their <HI>Eggarees,</HI> or <HI>Temples</HI> in Lamps fed with Oyl, which are alwayes attended by their Priests, and they talk of many of these which have burned without extinguishment from many foregoing generations.</P>
<P>And by the way, that wilde and mad phan∣sie of theirs, that their <HI>Zertoost</HI> did fetch fire from Heaven is as certainly true, as that ancient fiction and fable of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> that he did steal fire thence.</P>
<P>But to proceed, their Priests they call <HI>Da∣roos,</HI> or <HI>Harboods</HI> above both which they have a Chief, or High Priest they call the <HI>Destoor,</HI> who not often appears openly, but when he doth, he meets with much reverence and re∣spect given unto him by the common people, and so do those other Church-men which are his inferiours: unto all which they allow free maintenance for their more comfortable sub∣sistance.</P>
<P>Those Church-men by their Law are com∣manded to dwell near, and to abide much in their <HI>Eggar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> or <HI>Temples</HI> to give advice, or direction unto any that shall repair unto them for it. They observe divers Feasts, and imme∣diately after, each of them a Fast follows.</P>
<P>That living sensible Creature, which they first behold every morning (that is good &amp; ser∣viceable) is to them (as they say) a remembran∣cer all the day after, to draw up their thoughts
<PB N="358" REF="197"/>
in thanks-giving unto Almighty God; who hath made such good Creatures for mans use and service.</P>
<P>There are good things (as I have been in∣formed) in that book of their Religion deliver∣ed them in precepts, which their Law-giver hath left unto them for the direction of their lives.</P>
<P>As first, <HI>To have shame and fear ever pre∣sent with them, which will restrain, and keep them from the committing of many evils.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>when they undertake any thing, seriously to consider whither it be good, or bad, commanded, or forbidden them.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>To keep-their hearts and eyes from coveting any thing that is anothers, and their hands from hurting any.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>To have a care alwayes to speak the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>To be known onely in their own bu∣sinesses, and not to enquire into, and to busie themselves in other mens matters.</HI></P>
<P>All which are good moral precepts, but they have another which mars and spoils all the rest, and that is upon the greatest penalties they can be threatned withall.</P>
<P>Sixthly▪ <HI>Not to entertain, or believe any other Law besides that which was delivered unto them by their Law-giver.</HI></P>
<P>This people take but one wife, which hath
<PB N="359" REF="197"/>
liberty, as the wives of the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> to go a∣broad. They never resolve to take Wives, or Husbands without the advice of their Church-men, and when they come to be married, they stand some distance one from the other, there being two Church-men present on in the be∣half of the Man, and in behalf of the Woman the other. The first of these asks the Woman whither, or no she will have that man to be her Husband, and the other asks the Man whither, or no, he will have that Woman to be his Wife, and they both consenting, the Priests bring them together <HI>and join their hands,</HI> pray∣ing that they may live in unity and love toge∣ther, and then both those Church-men scatter Rice upon the married couple, intreating God to make them fruitfull in sending them many Sons and Daughters, that they may multiply as much as that <HI>seed</HI> doth in the ears that bear it. And so the Ceremony being thus performed, which is about the time of midnight, the whole company depart, leaving the married couple together.</P>
<P>At the birth of every Childe, they imme∣diately send for the <HI>Daroo,</HI> or Church-man, who comes to the parties house, and there being cer∣tainly enform'd of the exact time of the child∣birth, first undertakes to <HI>calculate</HI> its Nativi∣ty▪ and to speak something of it by way of pre∣diction, after which he confers with the Pa∣rents
<PB N="360" REF="198"/>
about a name whereby it shall be called, which when they have agreed upon, the Mo∣ther, in the presence of the company there as∣sembled, gives it that name.</P>
<P>And now lastly, touching the Burials of that people, they <HI>incircle pieces of ground</HI> with a round Wall, that is of a good height, set apart for that purpose. These burying places stand remote from houses &amp; roade wayes the ground within them is made smooth, or else paved on the bottom, in the middest whereof they have a round pit, made deep like a draw▪ well: The bodies of their dead, both men, women, and children are carried to those places, upon a Beer made of slight round Iron bars (for they will not have dead bodies touch any wood, least they should defile it, because that is <HI>fewel</HI> for their <HI>adored fire)</HI> and thus brought thither are laid round about near the inside of that Wall upon the ground, or pavements. Covered with a thin white Cloath; the <HI>Daroo,</HI> or <HI>Harboode</HI> accompanies the dead body near unto the door which enters that place (alwayes kept fast shut, but when it is opened upon this occasion to let in their dead) and come thither, speaks these words in the audience of all those which are thither assembled, <HI>That whereas the party deceased consisted of all the four Elements, he de∣sires that every one of them may now take his part.</HI> And this is the form they use, when they
<PB N="361" REF="198"/>
there thus dispose of the bodies of their dead. Which being there so left in that open place, are presently laid bare by the Fouls of the Air, who in short time after pick all their flesh clear from their bones, by consequence their fleshly part having no other Sepulchres, Graves, or Tombs, but the Craws and Gorges of those ravenous Fouls. And when upon this occa∣sion they enter that round stage of Mortality, the bare <HI>Skelitons</HI> they there finde, which have parted with all their flesh, are by those bearers of the dead cast into that deep round pit, where they mix promiscuously together, and so make room for other dead bodies.</P>
<P>But now that my Reader may not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onceive that I have endeavoured in some of these strange relations to write a new <HI>Romance,</HI> I would have him to think, that for my part I do believe that there is very much of truth in the particulars I have inserted, if there be any credit to be given to some men of much inte∣grity that lived amongst them, who made it a great part of their businesse to be satisfied in many of the particulars here spoken of, or if I might trust mine own eyes and ears that saw and heard much of it, which could have en∣abled me to have written a great deal more concerning the <HI>Rites, Ceremonies, Customes,</HI> wilde <HI>conceivings;</HI> and mad Idolatries of this people, as of the <HI>Hindoos</HI> spoken of before, if
<PB N="362" REF="199"/>
I durst have thrown away more time upon them; all which would have made my judici∣our Reader thus to have concluded with me, that those <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> ground very many of their opinions upon custom, tra∣dition and phansie not reason, much lesse upon safe rules that might lead them into and after keep them in the way of truth. They esteem∣ing it a very great boldnesse, a very high pre∣sumption to be wiser in their Religion th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their forefathers were (as many of the more ignorant sort of Papists will often say, though it be directly against themselves) and therefore are desirous to do, and to believe as their An∣cestors have before them; to fare as they have fared, and as they have sped to speed, though they perish everlastingly with them, never con∣sidering of, or ruminating on those things which they hold and maintain for truths, being like unto unclean <HI>Beasts, which chew not the Cudde.</HI></P>
<P>So much of that people in general: I come now more particularly to speak.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their King the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> his discent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw those <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> I have named, live under the subjection of the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> which <HI>Name,</HI> or rather <HI>Title</HI> (if my information abuse me not) signifies cir∣cumcised, as himself, and the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are; and therefore for his most general title he is called the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> as the chief of the cir∣cumcised, or the chief of the circumcision.</P>
<P>He is lineally descended from that most fa∣mous conqueror, called in our stories <HI>Tamber∣lane,</HI> concerning whose birth and original Hi∣stories much differ, and therefore I cannot de∣termine it; but in this, all that write of him agree, that he having got together very many huge multitudes of men, made very great con∣quests in the <HI>South-East</HI> parts of the World, not onely on <HI>Bajazet</HI> the Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> but also in <HI>East-India,</HI> and elsewhere; for what cannot force by multitudes do? This <HI>Tamberlane</HI> in their stories is called <HI>Amir Timur,</HI> or the great Prince and Emperor <HI>Ti∣mur,</HI> who (as they say) towards his end, either by an hurt received in his thigh, or else by an unhappy fall from his Horse, which made him
<PB N="364" REF="200"/>
halt to his grave, was ever after that called <HI>Ti∣mur lang,</HI> or <HI>Timur the lame,</HI> from whence he is corruptly in our stories, named <HI>amberlane,</HI> the late <HI>Mogol,</HI> at whose Court we lived, was the ninth in a direct line, from that his great Ancestor.</P>
<P>And now that my Reader may see the great <HI>Mogol</HI> in a <HI>Portrature</HI> (which was taken from a Picture of his drawn to the life) I have caused that to be here inserted, which presents him in his dayly unvaried Habite, as he is bedeckt, and adorned with Jewels, he continually wears; for the fashion of the Habite, in which he is here presented, it is for the fashion the Habite of that whole vast <HI>Empire;</HI> so that he who strictly views this; may see the dresse of the men throughout that whole great Monarchy.</P>
<P>After this I have set up the <HI>Royal standard</HI> of the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> which is a <HI>Couchant Lyon</HI> shadowing part of the body of the Sun.</P>
<P>And after that I have caused his <HI>Imperial Signet,</HI> or <HI>great Seal</HI> to be laid down before my Readers eyes, wherein nine rounds, or Cir∣cles, are the Names and Titles of <HI>Tamberlane,</HI> and his lineal successors in <HI>Persian</HI> words, which I shall make presently to speak <HI>English,</HI> and (as I conceive) no more in <HI>English,</HI> than what is fully expressed in those original words.</P>
<P>This Seal (as it is here made in <HI>Persian</HI> words) the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> either in a large, or

And the words on the <HI>Mogols</HI> Seal being <HI>imboss't,</HI> are put upon both sides of his Silver and Gold Coin, (for there is no image upon any of it.) And the like little Signets, or Seals are used by the great men of that Countrey, and so by others of inferiour rank, having their Names at length engraven on them with which they make impressions, or subscriptions by Ink put on them, to all their acts &amp; deeds, which round Circle is their hand and Seal to.</P>
<P>For <HI>Timar-lang,</HI> or <HI>Tamberlane,</HI> he was famous about the year of <HI>Christ</HI> 1398. in the last year of the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>Se∣cond, King</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> And he the first of the Race of those great <HI>Monarchs</HI> hath a Title, which <HI>speaks thus:</HI></P>

Here are very high titles taken by <HI>Tamber∣lane</HI> and his successors, and the lower we go, the greater still they are, but the last of them swels biggest of all, calling himself amongst other phansies <HI>the Conqueror of the world,</HI> and so he conceits himself to be; As they write of <HI>Thrasyllus</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> who believed that all the ships on the Sea were his own, and there∣fore he would call them, <HI>my ships,</HI> when ever he saw them floating on the waters; and thus the great <HI>Magol</HI> imagines all the Kings, Nations, and people of the world to be his Slaves and Vassals.</P>
<P>And therefore when the <HI>Grand Signiour,</HI> or great <HI>Turks</HI> sent an Ambassador to the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> who came unto him attended with a great train and retinue, and after when he was ready to take his leave, desired of the <HI>Mogol</HI> to know what he should say to his Master when he was returned; tell thy Master said the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI> that he is my <HI>slave,</HI> for my Ancestor Con∣quered him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> feeds and feasts himself with this conceit, that he is <HI>Conqueror of the world,</HI> and therefore (I conceive that he was troubled upon a time, when my Lord-Ambassador, have∣ing businesse with him, and upon those terms; there is no coming unto that King empty handed without some present, or other (of which more afterward) and having at that
<PB N="368" REF="203"/>
time nothing left, which he thought fit to give him, presented him with <HI>Mercators</HI> great book of <HI>Cosmography</HI> (which the Ambassador had brought thither for his own use) telling the <HI>Mogol</HI> that that book described the four parts of the world, and all several Countreys in them contained, the <HI>Mogol</HI> at the first seem'd to be much taken with it, desiring pre∣sently to see his own Territories, which were immediately shewen unto him, he asked where were those Countreys about them, he was told <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> as the names of the rest which confine with him, and then causing the book to be turn'd all over, and finding no more to fall to his share, but what he first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw, and he calling himself the <HI>Conqueror of the world,</HI> and having no greater share in it, seemed to be a little troubled, yet civily told the Ambassa∣dour that neither himself, nor any of his peo∣ple did understand the language in which that book was written, and because so, he further told him that he would not <HI>rob</HI> him of such a <HI>Jewel,</HI> and therefore returned it unto him a∣gain.</P>
<P>And the truth is, that the great <HI>Mogol</HI> might very well bring his action against <HI>Mer∣cator</HI> and others, who describe the world, but streighten him very much in their Maps, not al∣lowing him to be Lord &amp; Commander of those Provinces, which properly belong unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="203"/>
But it is true likewise that he, who hath the greatest share on the face of the earth, if it be compared with the whole world, appears not great. As it was said of the Lands of <HI>Alcibia∣des</HI> that compared with the Glob of the whole earth, they did not appear bigger than a small tittle. The <HI>Mogols</HI> Territories are more ap∣parent, large, and visible, as any one may take notice, who strictly views this affixed Map, wch is a true representation of that great Em∣pire in its large dimensions. So that although the <HI>Mogol</HI> be not master of the whole World, yet hath he a great share in it, if we consider his very large Territories, and his abundant riches, as will after more appear, whose wealth and strength makes him so potent, as that he is able, whensoever he pleaseth to make <HI>inroades upon,</HI> and to do much mischief unto any of his Neighbours, but I leave that, and come now to speak.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Mogols</HI> policy in his govern∣ment exercised by himself and substitutes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ANd it is that indeed, which is the worst of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll governments, called by <HI>Aristotle</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="204"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Arbitrary, illimited, Tyrannical, such as a most severe Master useth to Servants, not that which a good King administreth to Sub∣jects.</P>
<P>Which makes it very uncomfortable for those that live as subjects there, under the com∣mand of others, taller than themselves by their swords length, or so to be fixed in any part of the World.
<Q><L>—Where no Laws resist</L>
<L>The sword, but that it acteth what it lists.</L></Q></P>
<P>As in that <HI>Empire</HI> where the King measureth his power by his sword, or Launce in making his will, his guide, and therefore any thing lawfull that likes him; which carriage of his might very well become that Embleme of ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mited power, which is a sword waved by a strong arm and hand, and the word <HI>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> volo, sic jubeo,</HI> or thus will I have it; and if any there be so far discontented as to make any the least question at what he doth, he hath a far stronger argument still in readinesse, than all the force of Logick can make, and that is very many thousands of men that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and able Souldiers, whom he keeps continually in arms, and pay, that can make any thing good, which he shall please to command.</P>
<P>There are no Laws for Government kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that Empire upon record (for ought I could ever
<PB N="371" REF="204"/>
learn) to regulate Governours there in the ad∣ministration of Justice, but what are written in the breast of that King and his Substitutes, and therefore they often take liberty to proceed how they please, in punishing the Offender ra∣ther than the offence, mens persons more than their Crimes, <HI>aegrotum potius, quam morbum.</HI></P>
<P>Yet ever they pretend to proceed in their wayes of judicature (which is the right pro∣gresse in judgement) <HI>secundum allegata &amp; pro∣bata,</HI> by proofs and not by presumptions.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Mogol</HI> will sit himself as Judge, in any matters of consequence that happen nere unto him. And there are no Malefa∣ctors that lye more than one night in prison, and many times not at all, for if the party of∣fending be apprehended early in the day, he is immediately brought before him that must be his Judge, by whom he is presently either ac∣quitted, or condemned; if he be sentenced to be whipt, he hath his payment, and that (usually with very much severity) in the place (often,) where he received that sentence. If condem∣ned to dye, he is presently (which as I appre∣hend it is a very hard course, though used an∣ciently among the <HI>Jews)</HI> carried from his sen∣tence to his execution, which is done usally in the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or <HI>Market-place.</HI> And this round and quick Justice keep, the people there in such order, and awe, as that there are not many ex∣ecutions.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="205"/>
Murder and Theft they punish with death, &amp; with what kinde of death the Judge pleaseth to impose, for some Malefactors are hang'd, some beheaded, some impaled, or put upon sharp stakes (a death which hath much cruel∣ty, and extream torture and torment in it,) some are torn in places by <HI>wilde Beasts,</HI> some kill'd by <HI>Elephants;</HI> and others stung to death by <HI>Snakes.</HI></P>
<P>Those which are brought to suffer death by <HI>Elephants</HI> (some of which vast Creatures are train'd up to do execution on Malefactors) are thus dealt withall. First if that overgrown Beast be commanded by his Rider to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>patch that poor, trembling Offender presently, who lies <HI>prostrate</HI> before him, he will with his broad round foot immediately presse him to death, but if that wretched Creature be condemn'd, <HI>it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> mori, ut se mori sentiat,</HI> so to dye as that he may feel tortures, and torments in dying (which are as so many several deaths.) The <HI>Elephant</HI> will break his bones by degrees, (as men are broken upon the wheel) as first his Legs, then his Thighs, after that, the bones in both his Arms, this done, his wretched Spirit is left to breath its last out of the middest of those bro∣ken bones.</P>
<P>But it is a very sad thing, and very much un∣beseeming a man, as he is a man, to seem to take pleasure in executing of punishment, as
<PB N="373" REF="205"/>
those appear to do, who make it their businesse to study, and invent tortures to inflict on o∣thers.</P>
<P>Thus those <HI>Monsters of men</HI> did (in the pri∣mitive times of Christianity) devise new tor∣ments (for the exercise of the Faith, and pa∣tience of Christians) which in their relations are extream hard and sad to read of, much more in their suffering of them were they to be endured. Yet almighty God did then so sup∣port his people in the middest of all those grie∣vous extremities they were made to suffer, that their <HI>Tormentors</HI> were more troubled to in∣vent, then they were to endure tortures, so that they overcame, while they were overcome, and were (not more than men) but <HI>mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Con∣querors,</HI> over those, who seemed to conquer them.</P>
<P>I cannot deny but that the strength of <HI>pride</HI> may carry men very far, the strength of <HI>del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sion</HI> much further, as we may observe from the examples of the ancient <HI>Stoicks,</HI> and since them from others, whose Frantick opinions have made so prodigal of their limbs and lives, as that they would seem very little to regard ex∣treamity of tortures and sufferings, yea death it self.</P>
<P>When one told <HI>Theodorus, (Seneca</HI> the Phi∣losopher reports the stories) that he would hang him up alive in the Air, he answered thus, <HI>mi∣nitare
<PB N="374" REF="206"/>

Oh what pleasure is there in racking. Now what pity wrought in others, pride and delusion wrought in these.</P>
<P>The truth is, <HI>non p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>a, sed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ausa facit Mar∣tyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> it is not a mans suffering, but the reason of it, which made a <HI>Martyr,</HI> and therefore (however others bear things ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) they, and they onely <HI>to whom it is given not onely to be∣lieve, but also to suffer,</HI> can behold their suf∣ferings so with a clear eye of Faith, that though they be intolerable in themselves, and seem so to others, yet are they made easie to them. <HI>Ignatius</HI> came to the <HI>stake</HI> and <HI>kissed</HI> it, at which he was presently burnt. Others have in∣imbraced those flames which immediately af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n'd them into ashes, whence Tyrants &amp; persecutors have often served, though much a∣gainst their wills to build and enlarge the Church of <HI>Christ.</HI> As the persecution of <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> served to spread the Doctrine of salvation, in the Countreys thereabouts, and to raise up a number of Churches, that happening to per∣secutors, which might happen to a man, who to put out a <HI>quick fire</HI> of burning Coals should scatter them all over his Chamber, and so set
<PB N="375" REF="206"/>
on fire his whole House. The Church of Christ hath ever gained in persecution what it hath lost in prosperity. Therefore those Christians in the primitive Church when they were tor∣tured, <HI>would not except of deliverance,</HI> Heb. 11. 35. that is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pt of it upon any <HI>sinfull terms,</HI> and in the 138. of the same Chapter, they re∣ceived, or took possession of the promises which they had onely in hope a far off, and embraced them, as if they had had them <HI>in hand</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, they hug'd them, they kiss'd them as re∣sting abundantly satisfied, with the hope and expectation of them.</P>
<P><HI>If in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> life onely the people of God had hope, then were they of all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n most miserable,</HI> for they are here as some chief &amp; tender plants of another Countrey, who have much ado to live, and grow, whereas the wicked like weeds th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive without watering. The Devil is called the Prince of the World, and therefore it would be very strange, if any of Gods people should finde very much content where Satan hath <HI>so much to do.</HI> Here in this World <HI>optimi pissim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agunt,</HI> the best usually fare worst &amp; the righte∣ous have most wrong. But it will not alwayes be thus, <HI>a time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord,</HI> and then all tears shall be wiped from his peoples eyes, and all sadnesse shall be removed from their Spirits. <HI>Nec Malleus Tyrannorum, nec secur is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse∣cutionis,</HI>
<PB N="376" REF="207"/>
and (as one of the ancients sweetly comforts) when the Hammer of Tyranny can∣not touch, nor the Ax of persecution hurt them, for they shall be out of the reach of all fears, troubles, annoyances which make their lives here, sometimes for the present seem bitter unto them.</P>
<P>Without doubt the services of Gods people would be very ill rewarded, if they should con∣tinue here in this life still. But God (who lends them to the world) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owes them a far better turn than the whole earth can pay them, and therefore when he sees good removes them hence, because it is for their preferment, in the mean time though the miseries of Gods people be great, their dayes are short. And although Almighty God do not say it <HI>vocally,</HI> yet se∣cretly he speaks to all his people, as sometimes he did to <HI>Moses;</HI> after he had done all the words, which he appointed him to do here; he bids him go up to Mount <HI>Nebo,</HI> and <HI>dye there, Deut. 32. 50. go up and dye;</HI> as if he had said, <HI>go up and eat.</HI> So <HI>Joseph</HI> before him, <HI>said unto his brethren, I dye,</HI> Gen. 50. 24. as if he had said, <HI>I eat, I drink, I sleep.</HI> It is neither news or strange for any dear servant of God to think of dying: because he knows that he shall part with nothing by death, but what is a burden to him, his sin: loose nothing by dying, but what he would fain be rid of, his corruption.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="207"/>
Hence the ancient Fathers naming the death of the faithfull their birth, and the day of their Martyrdom the day of their Nativity, shewed what great satisfaction and content they had, in the thought and hope of the life to come. In the mean time they beheld their sufferings whatsoever they were so with the eye of Faith, (as before) that it made them easie to be en∣dured, <HI>while they looked not at things which were seen,</HI> or did not much regard them, <HI>but at the things which were not seen:</HI> for the things they saw, or felt here, how bitter, or sharp so∣ever they were, were temporal, transient, would have an end, but <HI>the things they saw not,</HI> but assuredly expected <HI>were eternal,</HI> where they should finde <HI>weight of glorie</HI> for <HI>lightnesse of affliction,</HI> 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18. And therefore said the same Apostle, <HI>Rom. 8. 18. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared unto the glorie which shall be revealed.</HI> I reckon <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, it is a <HI>Metaphor,</HI> either taken from <HI>accountants</HI> that put many particulars into one entire summe; or else from <HI>Logicians,</HI> who draw certain, or infallable <HI>con∣clusions</HI> from foregoing <HI>premises,</HI> Thus, I rec∣kon, or I conclude when I compare <HI>profit</HI> and <HI>losse</HI> together, as <HI>what</HI> I shall certainly gain, and what I may happily loose by the profession of the Gospel; when I have put all crosses and incumbrances in the one <HI>Scale,</HI> and the recom∣pence
<PB N="378" REF="208"/>
of the <HI>reward</HI> in the <HI>other,</HI> it amounts all to this, that the eternal <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight</HI> of the <HI>Crown</HI> doth exceedingly <HI>outweigh</HI> the momentary weight of the <HI>Crosse.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is with all men, <HI>who</HI> in their greatest pressures can see further than <HI>earth,</HI> as that first Martyr, professing the Gospel, <HI>Stephen did,</HI> (who died not upon a bed of <HI>Down,</HI> but under a shower of stones) yet could out of that terrible and thick <HI>storm look▪ into Heaven;</HI> and so do others, who can behold whatsoever they feel with the eye of Faith, and this is like that <HI>Tree</HI> which <HI>Moses cast into the bitter waters of</HI> Marah, <HI>and it made them sweet,</HI> Exod. 15. But as for others I have <HI>named,</HI> and shall further name, to behold their sufferings and torments, onely with the <HI>eye of sense,</HI> it must needs make their <HI>tortures</HI> (however they bear them out) out of measure to <HI>torment.</HI></P>
<P>I have been told by some, who were eye-witnesses (whom I dare credite, and therefore I dare relate it) of strange kindes of death exe∣cuted by the command of the King of <HI>Japan</HI> upon his subjects, where some are <HI>Crucified,</HI> or nailed to a Crosse: Others rather <HI>roasted, than burnt</HI> to death; Thus, there is a <HI>stake</HI> set up, and a Circle of fire at a pretty distance, made round about it; the condemned person being naked, is so fastned to that stake, as that he may move round about it, and so doth as
<PB N="379" REF="208"/>
long as he is able to stir, till his flesh begins to blister; then he falls down, and there lyes roar∣ing till the fire, made about him puts him to silen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by taking away both his voice and life.</P>
<P>Now they say that one great reason, why they put men there unto such exquisite tor∣ments, is, because they hold it a thing of the greatest <HI>dishonour</HI> there for any man to dye by the hand of an <HI>Executioner:</HI> therefore they are usually commanded, when they are sentenced to dye, to rip up, or cut open their own bellies, and those who will not so do are tormented in dy∣ing. Hence most of that people, when as they have received that hard command to prevent death, by dying; call for their friends about them, eat, and seem to be merry with them, &amp; then in the close of the meal, and in their pre∣sence, commit this sad slaughter upon them∣selves, as first those poor wretches make them∣selves naked to the middle, he, or they, who are to dye, then the most wretched <HI>self-murderer,</HI> who is to act that bloudy part, strikes a sharp Knife into the bottom of his belly, then rips himself up, and after gives himself one other cut cross his belly, and when he hath done both these, if after he can but wipe his bloudy knife upon a white paper, or Napkin that is laid by him, he is believed to part with his life with a very great deal of honour, and imme∣diately (as he is made to believe) goes to <HI>Faka∣man,</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="209"/>
whom they say is the God of War. So much power the Devil hath in those dark pla∣ces of the World, to make the people there do what he please. Oh 'tis a misery of all miseries here, to be a drudge, a bond-man, a slave to the Devil! as those, and so infinite multitudes more professing Christ are, by obeying Satan in his most unreasonable commands, and yet will not be made sensible of that, their basest bond∣age.</P>
<P>But to return again to the place frō whence I have made some excursion, when I was in <HI>India</HI> there was one sentenced by the <HI>Mogol</HI> himself, for killing his own father to dye thus; first he commanded that this <HI>Paricide</HI> should be bound alive by his heels, fastned to a small iron Chain, which was tied to the hinde leg of a great Ele∣phant, and then that this Elephant should drag him after him one whole remove of that King, from one place to another, which was about ten miles distant, that so all his flesh might be worne off his bones, and so it was, when we saw him in the way following that King in his progresse, for he appeared then to us a <HI>skeliton,</HI> rather than a body.</P>
<P>There was another condemned to dye by the <HI>Mogol</HI> himself, (while we were at <HI>Ama∣davar)</HI> for killing his own Mother, and at this the King was much troubled to think of death; suitable for so horrid a crime, but upon a little
<PB N="381" REF="209"/>
pause, he adjudged him to be stung to death by <HI>Snakes,</HI> which was accordingly done. I told you before that there are some <HI>Mountebanks</HI> there, which keep great <HI>Snakes</HI> to shew tricks with them; one of those fellows was presently called for to bring his <HI>Snakes</HI> to do that exe∣cution, who came to the place where that wretched Creature was appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to dye, and found him there all naked (except a little co∣vering before) and trembling. Then suddenly the <HI>Mountebank</HI> (having first angred and pro∣voked the venomous Creatures) put one of them to his Thigh, which presently twin'd it self about that part, till it came near his Groin, and there bit him till bloud followed, the other was fastned to the outside of his o∣ther Thigh, twining about it, (for those <HI>Snakes</HI> thus kept are, long and slender) and there bit him likewise, notwithstanding, the wretch kept upon his feet nere a quarter of an hour, before which time the <HI>Snakes</HI> were taken from him; But he complained exceedingly of a fire that with much torment had possessed all his Limbs, and his whole body began to swell exceed∣ingly, like <HI>Nasidius,</HI> bit by a <HI>Lybian</HI> Serpent, called a <HI>Prester,</HI> of whom Mr. <HI>May</HI> in his Translation of <HI>Lucan,</HI> the ninth Book thus writes:</P>
<Q><PB N="382" REF="210"/>
<L>His face and cheeks a sudden fire did rost;</L>
<L>His flesh and skin were stretch'd, his shape was lost.</L>
<L>His swelling body is distended far,</L>
<L>Past humane growth, and undistinguish'd are</L>
<L>His limbs, all parts the poyson doth confound,</L>
<L>And he lies hid in his own body drown'd.</L></Q>
<P>Now much after this manner did the sting∣ing of those <HI>Snakes</HI> work upon that wretch, &amp; about half an hour after they were taken from him, the Soul of that unnatural Monster left his growing Carkasse, and so went to its place. And certainly both those I last named so sen∣tenced, and so executed, most justly deserved to be handled with all severity, for taking away the lives of those from whom they had receiv'd their own▪ Some of our family did behold the execution done upon the later, who related all the passages of it, and for my part I might have seen it to, but that I had rather go a great way not to see, then one step to behold such a sight.</P>
<P>After the example of that King, his <HI>Gover∣nours</HI> deputed and set over Provinces and Ci∣ties proceed in the course of Justice, to impose what punishment and death they please upon all offendors, and malefactors.</P>
<P>That King never suffers any of his <HI>Vicege∣rents</HI> to tarry long in one place of Govern∣ment,
<PB N="383" REF="210"/>
but removes them usually (after they have exercised that power, which was given un∣to them in one place, for one year) unto some other place of Government, remote from the former, wherein they exercise their power, and this that King doth, that those, which be his Substitutes, may not in any place grow Popu∣lar.</P>
<P>I told them before that this people are very neat, shaving themselves so often, as that they feel the Rasor almost every day; but when that King sends any of them unto any place of Go∣vernment, or upon any other imployment, they cut not their hair at all, till they return again into his presence, as if they desired not to ap∣pear beautifull, or to give themselves any con∣tent in this while they live out of the Kings sight; and therefore the King, as soon as he sees them, bids them cut their hair.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Mogol</HI> by Letters sends his com∣mands to any of his Governours, those papers are entertain'd with as much respect as if him∣self were present; for the Governour having intelligence that such Letters are come near him, himself with other inferiour Officers ride forth to meet the <HI>Patamar,</HI> or messenger that brings them, and as soon as he sees those Let∣ters▪ he alights from his horse, falls down on the earth, and then takes them from the messenger and layes them on his head, whereon he binds
<PB N="384" REF="211"/>
them fast, and then returning to his place of publick meeting, for dispatch of businesses, he reads them, and answers their contents with all care and diligence.</P>
<P>The King oft times in his own person and so his substitutes appointed Governours for Pro∣vinces and Cities, Judge in all matters Crimi∣nal that concern life and death. There are other Officers to assist them, which are called <HI>Cut-walls</HI> (whose Office is like that of our <HI>She∣riffs</HI> in <HI>England)</HI> and these have many substi∣tutes under them, whose businesse it is to ap∣prehend, and to bring before these Judges such as are to be tried for things Criminal, or Capi∣tal, where the Offender (as before) knows pre∣sently what will become of him. And those Officers wait likewise on other Judges there, which are called <HI>Cadees,</HI> who onely meddle with Contracts and Debts, and other businesses of this Nature 'twixt man and man. Now these Officers arrest Debtors, and bring them before those Judges, and their sureties too, bound as with us in Contracts confirmed (as before) under their hands and seals, and if they give not content unto those which complain of them, they will imprison their persons, where they shall finde and feel the weight of fetters; nay, many times they will sell their persons, their Wives and Children into bondage, when they cannot satisfie their Debts; And the cu∣stom
<PB N="385" REF="211"/>
of that Countrey bears with such hard and pitilies courses, such as was complain'd of by the <HI>poor widow</HI> unto the Prophet <HI>Elisha;</HI> who when her husband was dead, and she not able to pay, <HI>the Creditor came and took her two sons to be bond men,</HI> 2 King. 4. 1.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> looked to be presented with some thing, or other, when my Lord Ambassa∣dour came to him, and if he saw him often empty handed, he was not welcom, and there∣fore the <HI>East-India</HI> Company were wont eve∣ry year to send many particular things unto him, in the name of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that were given him at several times, especial∣ly then when the Ambassadour had any re∣quest unto him, which made a very fair way unto it.</P>
<P>Amongst many other things, when my Lord Ambassadour first went thither, the Company sent the <HI>Mogol</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Coach, and Harnesse for four Horses, and an able Coach-man, to sute and mannage some of his excellent Horses, that they might be made fit for that service. The Coach they sent was lined within with Crimson <HI>China velvet,</HI> which when the <HI>Mogol</HI> took notice of, he told the Ambassadour that he wondred the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> would trou∣ble himself so much, as to send unto <HI>China</HI> for Velvet to Line a Coach for him, in regard that he had been informed, that the <HI>English</HI> King
<PB N="386" REF="212"/>
had much better Velvet near home, for such, or any other uses.</P>
<P>And immediately after the <HI>Mogol</HI> caused that Coach to be taken all to pieces, and to have another made by it, for (as before) they are a people that will make any new thing by a pattern, and when his new Coach was made according to the pattern, his work-men first putting the <HI>English</HI> Coach together, did so with that they had new made, then pulling out all the <HI>China</HI> Velvet which was in the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Coach, there was in the room thereof put a very rich Stuffe, the ground silver, wrought all over in spaces with variety of flowers of silk, excellently well suited for their colours, and cut short like a Plush, and in stead of the brasse Nails that were first in it, there were Nails of silver put in their places. And the Coach, which his own work-men made was lined and seated likewise with a richer stuffe than the for∣mer, the ground of it Gold, mingled like the other with silk flowers, and the Nails silver and double guilt; and after having Horses and Har∣nesse fitted for both his Coaches, He rode some∣times in them, and contracted with the <HI>English</HI> Coach-man to serve him, whom he made ve∣ry fine, by rich vests he gave him, allowing him a very great Pension; besides, he never carried him in any of those Coaches, but he gave him the reward of ten pounds at the least, which
<PB N="387" REF="212"/>
had raised the Coach-man unto a very great Estate, had not death prevented it, and that immediately after he was setled in that great service.</P>
<P>The <HI>East-India</HI> Company sent other pre∣sents for that King, as excellent Pictures which pleased the <HI>Mogol</HI> very much, especialy if there were fair and beautifull Women portrayed in them. They sent likewise Swords, Rapiers, ex∣cellently well hatcht, and pieces of rich <HI>im∣broidery</HI> to make sweet baggs, and rich Gloves, and handsome Looking glasses, &amp; other things to give away, that they might have alwayes some things in readiness to present both to the King, and also to his Governours, where our Factories were setled, for all these were like those <HI>rulers of Israel</HI> mentioned, <HI>Hosea 4. 18. who would love to say with shame, give ye.</HI> They looked to be presented with something, when our Factors had any especial occasion to repair unto them, and if the particular thing they then presented did not like them well, they would desire to have it exchanged for something else, happily they having never heard of our good and modest proverb, <HI>that a man must not look into the mouth of a given Horse.</HI> And it is a very poor thing indeed which is freely given, and is not worth the taking.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> sometimes by his <HI>Firmauns,</HI> or
<PB N="388" REF="213"/>
or Letters Patents, will grant some particular things unto single, or divers persons, and pre∣sently after will contradict those Grants by other Letters, excusing himself thus, that he is a great, and an absolute King, and therefore must not be tied unto any thing, which if he were, he said that he was a slave, and not a free man: Ye what he promised was usually enjoyed, although he would not be tied to a certain performance of his promise. There∣fore there can be no dealing with this King upon very sure terms, who will say and un∣say, promise and deny. Yet we <HI>English</HI> men did not at all suffer by that inconstancy of his, but there found a free Trade, a peaceable re∣sidence, and a very good esteem with that King and people; and much the better (as I conceive) by reason of the prudence of my Lord Ambassadour, who was there (in some sense) <HI>like Joseph</HI> in the <HI>Court of Pharoah,</HI> for whose sake all his Nation there, seemed to fare the better. And we had a very easie way upon any grievance to repair to that King, as will appear now in my next <HI>Section</HI> which speaks.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of him, shewing himself three times pub∣lickly unto his people every day, and in what state and glory he doth oftentimes appear.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIrst, early in the morning at that very time, the Sun begins to appear above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> He appears unto his people in a place very like unto one of our <HI>Balconies,</HI> made in his houses, or Pavilions for his morning ap∣pearance, directly opposite to the East, about seven, or eight foot high from the ground, a∣gainst which time a very great number of his people▪ especially of the greater sort, who de∣sire as of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en as they can to appear in his eye, as∣semble there together to give him the <HI>Salam,</HI> or good morning, crying all out as soon as they see their King with a loud voice <HI>Padsha Sala∣met,</HI> which signifies, <HI>live ô Great King,</HI> or O great King, <HI>health and life,</HI> (as all the people cried, 1 <HI>King. 1. 39. God save King</HI> Solomon: and thus they clapped their hands for joy when <HI>Jehoash</HI> was made King, crying, <HI>God save the King,</HI> or let the King live, 2 <HI>King</HI> 11. 12.) At noon he shews himself in another place like the former, on the South-side, and a little be∣fore Sun-set, in a like place, on the West-side
<PB N="390" REF="214"/>
of his house, or Tent, but as soon as the Sun forsakes the <HI>Hemisphear,</HI> he leaves his people ushered in and out with Drums and Winde in∣struments, and the peoples acclamations.</P>
<P>At both which times likewise very great numbers of his people assemble together to present themselves before him: And at any of these three times, he that hath a <HI>suite</HI> to the King or desires Justice at his hands, be he poor, or Rich, if he hold up a Petition to be seen, shall be heard and answered.</P>
<P>And between seven and nine of the Clock at night, he sits within his House, or Tent, more privately in a spacious place, called his <HI>Goozal∣can,</HI> or bathing house made bright, like day by abundance of lights, and here the King sits mounted upon a stately <HI>Throne,</HI> where his Nobles and such as are favoured by him stand about him, others finde admittance to, but by special leave from his Guard, who cause every one that enters that place to breath upon them, and if they imagine that any have drunk wine, they keep him out.</P>
<P>At this time my Lord Ambassadour made his usual addresses to him, and▪ I often waited on him thither, and it was a good time to do businesse with that King, who then was for the most part very pleasant, and full of talk unto those which were round about him, and so con∣tinued till he fell a sleep, (oft times by drink∣ing)
<PB N="391" REF="214"/>
and then all assembled immediately quit∣ted the place, besides those which were his tru∣sted servants, who by turns watched his Per∣son.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> hath a most stately, rich and spacious house at <HI>Agrae,</HI> his <HI>Metropolis,</HI> or chief Citie, which is called his <HI>Palace Royal,</HI> wherein there are two Towers, or Turrets a∣bout ten foot square covered with massie God (as ours are usualy with Lead) this I had from <HI>Tom. Coriat,</HI> as from other <HI>English</HI> Merchants, who keep in a Factory at that place. And fur∣ther they told me, that he hath a most glorious <HI>Throne</HI> within that his Palace, ascended by di∣vers steps, which are covered with plate of <HI>silver,</HI> upon the top of which ascent stand four <HI>Lions</HI> upon pedestals (of curiously coloured Marble) which Lions are all made of <HI>Massie silver,</HI> some part of them guilded with Gold, and beset with precious stones. Those Lions support a <HI>Canopy</HI> of pure Gold, under which the <HI>Mogol</HI> sits, when as he appears in his greatest state and glory.</P>
<P>For the <HI>beauty</HI> of that <HI>Court</HI> it consists not in gay and Gorgious apparel, for the Countrey is so hot, that they cannot endure any thing that is very warm, or massie, or rich about them. The <HI>Mogol</HI> himself for the most part is cover∣ed with a garment (as before described) made of pure, white, and fine Callico Laune, and so
<PB N="392" REF="215"/>
are his Nobles, which Garments are washed after one dayes wearing. But for the <HI>Mogol,</HI> though his cloathing be not rich and costly, yet I believe that there is never a Monarch in the whole world that is dayly adorned with so ma∣ny Jewels as himself is. Now, they are Jewels which make mens covering most rich, such as people in other parts sometimes wear about them, that are otherwise most meanly habited, to which purpose I was long since told by a Gentleman of honour sent as a Companion to the old▪ <HI>Earle of Nothingham,</HI> when he was imployed as an extraordinary Ambassadour by King <HI>James,</HI> to confirm the peace made 'twixt himself and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which Ambassadour had a very great many <HI>Gentle∣men</HI> in his train, in as Rich <HI>cloathing</HI> as <HI>Velvets</HI> and <HI>Silks</HI> could make, but then there did appear many a great <HI>Don,</HI> or <HI>Grandee</HI> in the <HI>Spanish Court,</HI> in a long black bayes Cloak and Cas∣sack, which had one <HI>Hatband of Diamonds,</HI> which was of more worth by far, than all the <HI>bravery</HI> of the Ambassadours many <HI>followers.</HI></P>
<P>But for the <HI>Mogol</HI> I wonder not at his ma∣ny Jewels, he being (as I conceive) the great∣est, and richest Master of precious stones that inhabites the whole earth. For <HI>Diamonds</HI> (which of all other are accounted most pre∣cious stones) they are found in <HI>Decan</HI> (where the Rocks are, out of which they are digged)
<PB N="393" REF="215"/>
the Princes whereof are the next Neighbours and Tributares to the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> and they pay him as Tribute many Diamonds yearly, and further, he hath the refusal of all those rich stones they sell, he having Gold and Sil∣ver in the greatest abundance, (and that will purchase any thing but heaven) and he will part with any mony for any <HI>Gems</HI> beside, that are precious and great, whither <HI>Rubies,</HI> or any other stones of value, as also for rich <HI>Pearls.</HI></P>
<P>And his Grandees follow him in that phan∣sie, for one of his great Lords gave our Mer∣chants there, twelve hundred pounds sterling for one Pearle, which was brought out of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> The Pearle was shaped like a Pare, very large, beautifull, and Orient, and so its price deserved it should be.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Mogol</HI> having such an abundance of Jewels, wears many of them dayly, enough to exceed those women, which <HI>Rome</HI> was wont to shew in their <HI>Starlike dresses,</HI> who in the height and prosperity of that Empire
<Q><L>—Were said to wear</L>
<L>The spoils of Nations in one ear.</L></Q></P>
<P>Or, <HI>Lollia Paulina,</HI> who was hid with Jewels. For the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> the Diamonds, and Ru∣bies, and Pearls, which are very many, &amp; dayly worn by him, are all of an extraordinary great∣nesse, and consequently of an exceeding great
<PB N="394" REF="216"/>
value. And besides those he wears about his <HI>Shash,</HI> or head covering, he hath a long Chain of Jewels hanging about his Neck (as long as an ordinary Gold Chain) others about his wrists, and the Hilts of his Sword and Dag∣ger are most curiously enriched with those pre∣cious Stones, besides others of very great value, which he wears in Rings on his fingers.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Ju. Sat.</HI> 1.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>He airs his sweaty fingers with rings freight,</L>
<L>And Jewels, as if burdened with their weight.</L></Q>
<P>The first of <HI>March</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI> begins a royal Feast, like that which <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> made in the third year of his Reign, <HI>Esth. 1. wherein he shewed the riches of his glorious Kingdom.</HI> This feast the <HI>Mogol</HI> makes, is called the <HI>Noo∣roos,</HI> that signifies nine dayes, which time it continues, to usher in the new year, which be∣gins with the <HI>Mahometans</HI> there, the tenth day of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Against which Feast, the Nobles assemble themselves together at that Court in their greatest Pomp, presenting their King with great gifts, and he requiting them again with Prin∣cely rewards, at which time I being in his pre∣sence, beheld most immense and incredible
<PB N="395" REF="216"/>
riches, to my amazement, in Gold, Pearls, Pre∣cious stones, Jewels, and many other glittering vanities. This Feast is usually kept by the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI> while he is in his Progresse, and lodges in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents.</P>
<P>Whether his Diet at this time be greater than ordinary I know not, for he alwayes eats in private among his Women, where none but his own Family see him while he is eating; which Family of his consists of his Wives and Children, and Women, and Eunuchs, and his boyes, and none but these abide and lodge in the Kings houses, or Tents, and therefore how his Table is spread, I could never know, but doubtlesse he hath of all those vanities that Em∣pire affords, if he so please. His food (they say) is served in unto him in Vessels of Gold, which covered, and brought unto him by his Eunuchs, after it is <HI>proved</HI> by his <HI>Tasters</HI> he eats, not at any set times of the day, but he hath provision ready at all times, and calls for it when he is hungry, and never but then.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>September</HI> (which was the late <HI>Mogols</HI> birth day) he retaining an ancient yearly Custom, was in the presence of his chief <HI>Grandies</HI> weighed in a <HI>Balance,</HI> the Ceremony performed within his House, or Tent, in a fair spacious Room, whereinto none were admit∣mitted but by special leave. The <HI>Scales</HI> in which he was thus weighed were plated with
<PB N="396" REF="217"/>
Gold, and so the beam on which they hung, by great <HI>Chains</HI> made likewise of that most precious <HI>Metal,</HI> the King sitting in one of them was weighed first <HI>against silver Coin,</HI> which immediately after was distributed among the <HI>poor,</HI> then was he weighed against Gold, after that against Jewels (as they say) but I observed (being present there with my Lord Ambassa∣dour) that he was weighed against three several things, laid in silken <HI>Bags</HI> on the contrary Scale, when I saw him in the <HI>Balance I thought on</HI> Belshazzar, <HI>who was found</HI> to light, <HI>Dan.</HI> 5. 27. By his weight (of which his Physicians yearly keep an exact account) they presume to guesse of the present estate of his body, of which they speak flatteringly, however they think it to be.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Mogol</HI> is thus weighed, he casts about among the standers by <HI>thin pieces of sil∣ver</HI> &amp; some of Gold, made like flowers of that Countrey, and some of them are made like <HI>Cloves,</HI> and some like <HI>Nutmegs,</HI> but very thin and hollow. Then he drinks to his Nobles in his <HI>Royal wine</HI> (as that of <HI>Ahasuerus is called)</HI> Esth. 1. 7.) who pledge his health, at which so∣lemnity he drank to my Lord Ambassadour, in a Cup of <HI>Gold</HI> most curiously <HI>enameled,</HI> and set all over the outside with <HI>stones</HI> (which were small Rubies, Turkesses, and Emeralds) with a Cover, or Plate to set it in, both of <HI>pure Gold,</HI>
<PB N="397" REF="217"/>
the brims of which plate, and the cover were <HI>enameled,</HI> and set with <HI>stones</HI> as the other, and all these together weighed <HI>twenty &amp; four ounces of our</HI> English <HI>weight,,</HI> which he then gave un∣to my Lord Ambassadour, whom he ever used with very much respect, and would moreover often ask him why he did not desire some good, and great gifts at his hands, he being a great King, and able to give it, the Ambassadour would reply, that he came not thither to beg any thing of him, all that he desired was that his Countrey-men the <HI>English</HI> might have a free and safe and peaceable trade in his Domi∣nions, the <HI>Mogol</HI> would answer that he was bound in honour to afford them that, we co∣ming from the furthermost parts of the world to trade there, and would often bid the Ambas∣sadour to ask something for himself, who to this would answer, that if that King knew not better to give, then <HI>he</HI> knew to <HI>ask,</HI> he must have nothing from him, upon these terms they continually both stood, so that in conclusion the Ambassadour had no gift from him, but that before mentioned, besides an horse, or two, and sometimes a <HI>Vest,</HI> or upper Garment made of slight Cloath of Gold, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> would first put upon his own back, and then give it to the Ambassadour. But the <HI>Mogol</HI> (if he had so pleased) might have bestowed on him some great <HI>Princely gift,</HI> and found no
<PB N="398" REF="218"/>
greater misse of it, than there would be of a Glasse of water taken out of a great Fountain; yet although the <HI>Mogol</HI> had such infinite Trea∣sures, yet he could finde room to store up more still, the desires of a covetous heart being so unsatiable, as that it never knows when it hath enough, being like a bottomlesse purse that can never be fill'd, for the more it hath, the more still it covets.</P>
<P>See an image hereof in <HI>Alcmaeon,</HI> who being will'd by <HI>Craesus</HI> to go into his Treasure house, and there take as much Gold as himself could carry away, provided for that purpose a long Garment that was double down to his <HI>ankles,</HI> and great <HI>bootes,</HI> and fill'd them both; nay, he stuffed his <HI>mouth,</HI> and tied wedges of Gold to the <HI>locks</HI> of his <HI>head,</HI> and doubtlesse, but for killing himself, he would have fill'd his <HI>skull</HI> &amp; <HI>bowels</HI> therewith. Here was an <HI>heart</HI> set upon Gold, and Gold over-lading an heart, for the Man stowing so much about him, as that he could not stir with it, forfeited what he might have had, and was turned out of the Trea∣sury, as poor and empty as he came into it. He is a <HI>rich</HI> man whatever he hath (be it more, or lesse) that is <HI>contented.</HI> He is a <HI>poor</HI> man, who still wants more, in becoming poor by plenty, wanting what he hath, as well, as much, as what he hath not, and so do very many, who are the greatest engrossers of the worlds wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="218"/>
But certainly there is no heart more poor and barren than that which is set upon abun∣dance, and as a the ground wherein there are <HI>Mines</HI> of Gold and Silver, and the most pre∣cious Stones is most <HI>barren;</HI> so the <HI>hearts</HI> of such as are most violently carried on after the desire of these things are most <HI>barren likewise.</HI> Therfore almighty God in wisdom hath laid up Treasures in the bowels of the earth <HI>secretly,</HI> and <HI>basely, secretly</HI> that they should not be to much <HI>sought after,</HI> and <HI>basely,</HI> that they should not be too much <HI>desired</HI> nor valued. Hence the Prophet <HI>Habak.</HI> 2 6. speaks thus to covetous men, <HI>woe be to him that lades himself with thick clay, how long?</HI> where riches are compared to <HI>thick clay,</HI> because they are but the very self-same earth we tread on, better <HI>hardened</HI> and <HI>coloured;</HI> and because they are many times a burden unto him that hath them, <HI>how long?</HI> saith the Prophet is there no end of encreasing? <HI>how long?</HI> hath the <HI>Sea</HI> bars and bounds. and the desires of man in this case without all <HI>mo∣deration? how long?</HI> can any ever hope to fill and satisfie their hearts with this? let them know that the barren <HI>womb,</HI> and the unmerci∣full <HI>grave,</HI> and unsatiable <HI>death</HI> will sooner be <HI>satisfied,</HI> than the <HI>hearts</HI> set upon riches find sa∣tisfaction from them, for <HI>he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver,</HI> Eccles. 5. 10. and therefore they who can come up to a right
<PB N="400" REF="219"/>
understanding of themselves in this case, will have a far greater cause to fear, than to desire <HI>abundance.</HI></P>
<P>Which that great Emperour <HI>hath,</HI> yet still would have <HI>more.</HI> This covetousnesse carries men very far; and <HI>ambition</HI> (which is a <HI>refin'd,</HI> or rather an <HI>heightned</HI> covetousnesse) still fur∣ther.</P>
<P>I have observed much of the <HI>Riches,</HI> and <HI>Pomp,</HI> and <HI>Greatnesse,</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> So in the book of <HI>Esth.</HI> Chap. 1. we may read <HI>of the goodly Tabernacle of King</HI> A∣hasuerus, <HI>in the Garden of his Palace, where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastned with Coards of fine linnen, and purple, and silver rings, and pillars of Marble! the Beds were of Gold and Silver, upon a Pavement of Porphyre and Alabaster, and Stone of blue-colour;</HI> and he gave those (whom he there feasted) <HI>drink in changes of vessels of Gold, &amp; royal wine in</HI> abun∣dance, <HI>according to the state of the King.</HI> We may further read there of his <HI>hundred and se∣ven and twenty Provinces,</HI> and his <HI>Princes,</HI> and <HI>Captains thereof,</HI> his <HI>Throne and his Palace at Shushan,</HI> &amp;c. So of the <HI>Treasures of Hezekiah,</HI> Esa. 39. his <HI>Silver and Gold,</HI> his <HI>spices</HI> and <HI>pre∣cious Oyntments, and Armory, and all the store of his house, which he and his Fathers had laid up,</HI> &amp;c. So of <HI>Belshazzar his thousand Princes, Wives and Concubines,</HI> Dan. 5. O what <HI>shadows</HI>
<PB N="401" REF="219"/>
do these <HI>hundreds</HI> and <HI>thousands</HI> cast over the <HI>heads of men,</HI> to give comfort unto them for the present, and to make them say <HI>under these co∣verts will we sit and be at rest,</HI> and forget, that some sudden <HI>messenger</HI> from the <HI>Lord,</HI> either <HI>sicknesse,</HI> or <HI>death,</HI> or the <HI>like</HI> can presently <HI>de∣prive</HI> them of all their present <HI>enjoyments</HI> and <HI>comforts.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Mogol</HI> takes a course to put the re∣membrance of <HI>death</HI> as far from him, as possi∣bly he can, and therefore there is no man that at any time wears any <HI>blue thing</HI> in that Kings presence, which is there the colour of mourners, neither is the name of <HI>death</HI> at any time men∣tioned in that <HI>Kings ears,</HI> but when any one is dead, of whom his Majesty must have intelli∣gence, the message is delivered unto him in milde, soft, flattering terms to this purpose, <HI>such, or such a one hath made himself a Sacri∣fice at your Majesties feet. ô Mors quam acer∣ba est memoria tua homini Pacem habenti in Possessionibus suis.</HI></P>
<Q><L>O death, how bitter are thy thoughts to one</L>
<L>Who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase enjoyes in his possession!</L>
<L>No losse he deemes so great, as losse of breath,</L>
<L>Death 'tis to such a one, to think of death.</L></Q>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of his pastimes at home and abroad, and where something of his qua∣lity, and disposition.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw what he doth, and how he behaves himself amongst his house-full of Wives and Women cannot be known, and therefore not related; but when he shews himself (as before) <HI>thrice openly</HI> to his people, every day he had alwayes something▪ or other presented
<PB N="403" REF="220"/>
before him to make him sport, and to give him present content.</P>
<P>As sometimes he delighted himself in seeing <HI>Horses ridden,</HI> the Natives there (as before) being very excellent in their well managing of them. Sometimes he saw his great <HI>Elephants</HI> fight. And at other times he pleased himself in seeing <HI>wrestling</HI> or <HI>dauncing,</HI> or <HI>jugling,</HI> and what else he liked.</P>
<P>And it happened that (but a few years be∣fore our abode there) a <HI>Juggler</HI> of <HI>Bengala</HI> (a Kingdom famous for Witches, and men of that profession) brought an <HI>Ape</HI> before the King (who was ever greedy to please himself with Novelties) professing that he would do many strange feats, the <HI>Mogol</HI> was ready presently to make a trial of this, and forthwith called some <HI>boyes</HI> about him (which he was conceived to keep for such a use as I dare not name,) &amp; pluc∣king a Ring from his finger gave it one of them to hide, that he might make a trial whither, or no the Ape could finde it out; who presently went to the boy that had it. The <HI>Mogol</HI> made some further trials like this, where the Ape did his part as before. And before the Ape was ta∣ken out of his presence, this strange, following, and unexpected thing came into the <HI>Kings</HI> thought. There are (said he) many <HI>disputes</HI> in the World about that true <HI>Prophet</HI> which should come into the World. We said the

<P>Then <HI>Mahobet-Chan,</HI> a great Noble man of that Court, and in high favour with the King, said, that it was some imposture of the Christians (though there were none that did bear that name there present) and desired that he might make a third trial, which granted, he put but eleven of those names together, reser∣ving the name of <HI>Christ</HI> in his hand; the Ape searching as before, pull'd forth his <HI>paw empty,</HI> and so twice, or thrice together, the <HI>King</HI> de∣manding
<PB N="405" REF="221"/>
a reason for this, was answered, that happily the thing he looked for was not there, he was bid to search for it, and then putting out those <HI>eleven names</HI> one after the other, in a seeming indignation <HI>rent them,</HI> then running to <HI>Mahobet-Chan</HI> caught him by the hand where the Name of <HI>Christ</HI> was <HI>concealed,</HI> which de∣livered, he opened the <HI>Scrolle,</HI> and so held it up to the <HI>King,</HI> but did not tear it as the former, upon which the <HI>Mogol</HI> took the Ape, and gave his Keeper a good Pension for to keep him near about him, calling him the <HI>Divining Ape,</HI> and this was all that followed upon this admirable thing, except the great wonder and amazement of that people.</P>
<P>There was one some years since wrote this story (but somewhat varied from that I have here related) in a little printed Pamphlet, and told his Reader that I had often seen that Ape while I lived in those parts, which particular he should have left out; but for the Relation it self, I believe it was so, because it hath been often confirmed there in its report unto me by divers <HI>persons,</HI> who knew not one another, and were differing in Religion, yet all agreed in the <HI>story,</HI> and in all the <HI>circumstances</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>This I am sure of that Almighty God, who can do what he will do (for all things are so far from being impossible to him, that nothing is hard) can do <HI>wonderfull things</HI> by the <HI>weak∣est
<PB N="406" REF="222"/>
means,</HI> that the <HI>weaker</HI> the instruments are, the more <HI>glory</HI> moy be ascribed unto him while he acts by them.</P>
<P>In the sacred storie <HI>Pharoah</HI> had no sooner asked, who is the Lord? <HI>Ex.</HI> 5. but presently some of the weakest of the Creatures rise up, and appear (as it were in Arms) to tell him, who the Lord was; so that he who formerly thought that there was no power, either in hea∣ven, or earth, to master, or contradict him, is presently confuted, and conquered by <HI>Frogs,</HI> and <HI>Flies,</HI> and <HI>Lice,</HI> and <HI>Caterpillars,</HI> by those poor, infirm, silly, and most despicable <HI>Crea∣tures,</HI> who when they had entred the lists, would not give proud <HI>Pharoah</HI> over, till they had humbled him, and magnified their maker, <HI>virtus Dei in infirmitate. Balaams</HI> Asse had more discovered unto him than unto his Rider, and so had this <HI>Ape</HI> (as it should seem) more, than to his <HI>beholders,</HI> or to his keeper.</P>
<P>Now for the disposition of that King, it ever seemed unto me to be composed of <HI>extreams,</HI> for sometimes he was barbarously cruel, and at other times he would seem to be exceeding fair, and gentle.</P>
<P>For his cruelties, he put one of his women to a miserable death, one of his women he had formerly touched and kept Company withall, but now she was superannuated, for neither himself nor Nobles (as they say) come near
<PB N="407" REF="222"/>
their wives, or women, after they exceed the age of thirty years, though they keep them, and al∣low them some maintenance. The fault of that woman, this the <HI>Mogol</HI> upon a time found her, and one of his Eunuchs kissing one ano∣ther, and for this very thing the King presently gave command that a round hole should be made in the earth, and that her body should be put into that hole, where she should stand with her head onely above ground, and the earth to be put in again unto her close, round about her, that so she might stand in the parching Sun, till the extream hot <HI>beams</HI> thereof did kill her, in which torment she lived one whole day, and the night following, and almost till the next noon, crying out most lamentably while she was able to speak in her language, as the <HI>Shu∣namites</HI> Childe did in his 2 <HI>King. 4. Ah my head, my head!</HI> which horrid execution, or ra∣ther murder was acted near our house, where the Eunuch by the command of the said King was brought very near the place where this poor Creature was thus buried alive, and there in her sight <HI>cut all into pieces.</HI></P>
<P>That great King would be often overcome by Wine, yet (as if he meant to appropriate that sin to himself) would punish others with very much severity, who were thus distempered.</P>
<P>I have long since heard a story which is some∣what pararel to this, that in former times when
<PB N="408" REF="223"/>
this land, in which we live, did not so much stink of that beastly sin of drunkennesse, which robs a man of himself, and leaves a beast in the skin of a man, I say, when drunkennesse in <HI>England</HI> was not so common: There was a <HI>Ju∣stice of Peace</HI> in this Nation (and I believe that the story is very true) which laid a poor <HI>Butoher</HI> by the heels for presuming to be drunk, telling him that he was but a poor beggerly fellow, and he presume to be drunk, and therefore he would punish him, saying further, that it was enough for his eldest Son so to be, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but this by the way.</P>
<P>Sometimes for little, or no faults, the <HI>Mogol</HI> would cause men to be most severely whip't, till they were almost ready to dye under the rod, which after they must kisse in thankful∣nesse.</P>
<P>He caused one of his servants of the higher ranke, to be very much whipt for breaking a <HI>China</HI> Cup he was commanded to keep safe, and then sent him into <HI>China,</HI> (which is a mar∣velous distance from thence) to buy another.</P>
<P>Sometimes in other of his mad distempers he would condemne men to <HI>servitude,</HI> or <HI>dismem∣ber,</HI> or else put them to death, as sacrifices to his will and passion, not Justice. So that it might be said of him <HI>quando male nemo pejus,</HI> that when he did wickedly none could do worse, as if it had been true of him which was spoken
<PB N="409" REF="223"/>
of that monster <HI>Nero</HI> observed before, who was called <HI>Lutum sanguine maceratum,</HI> dirt soaked in bloud.</P>
<P>For his good actions he did relieve conti∣nually many poor people; and not seldom would shew many expressions of duty and strong affection to his Mother, then living, so that he who esteemed the whole World as his Vassals would help to carry her in a <HI>Palankee</HI> upon his shoulders, and in this he did exceeding∣ly differ from that most unnatural and cruel <HI>Nero,</HI> who most barbarously killed his own Mother <HI>Agrippina,</HI> causing (as they write) that Bed, in which he was conceived, and from whence born, and wherein he took up his first lodging to be ript up and spoiled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> would often visite the cells of those he esteemed religious men, whose persons he esteemed sacred, as if they had been <HI>Demi∣gods.</HI></P>
<P>And he would speak most respectively of our blessed Saviour Christ, but his Parentage, his poverty, and his crosse did so confound his thoughts, that he knew not what to think of them. (As <HI>Bernard</HI> complained of some in his time, that they took offence at the clowts and rags of our <HI>blessed Saviour,</HI> at the humility and meannesse of his birth) believing that it could not stand with the Majesty of the <HI>Son of God</HI> to appear in the World, in such meannesse
<PB N="410" REF="224"/>
as he did; though he had been told that <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> came into the World in that low condi∣tion that he might beat down the pride thereof. And that at his first <HI>coming</HI> he came for sin∣ners, and then he came in great <HI>humility</HI> but at his second coming he shall come against sin∣ners, and then will he appear in power, &amp; great glory.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>Mogol</HI> is very free and noble un∣to all those which fall into, and abide in his af∣fection, which brings me now to speak.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the exceeding great Pensions the <HI>Mogol</HI> gives unto his Subjects, how they are raised, and how long they are continued, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHich great revenues that many of them do enjoy, makes them to live like great Princes rather than other men. Now for those Pensions, which are so exceeding great, the <HI>Mogol</HI> in his far extend∣ed Monarchy allowes yearly pay for <HI>one Mil∣lion of horse,</HI> and for every horse and man about eighteen pounds sterling <HI>per annum,</HI> which is exactly paid every year, raised from Land, and other Commodities which that Empire affords
<PB N="411" REF="224"/>
and appointed for that purpose. Now some of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s most beloved Nobles have the pay of <HI>six thousand horse;</HI> and there are others (at the least twenty in his Empire) which have the pay of 5000. horse, exceeding large Pen∣sions above the <HI>revenue</HI> of any other Subjects in the whole World, they amounting unto more than <HI>one hundred thousand pounds</HI> yearly unto a <HI>particular man.</HI> Now others have the pay of <HI>four thousand horse;</HI> others of three, or two, or one thousand horse, and so downward, and these by their proportions, are appointed to have horses alwayes in readinesse well mann'd and otherwise appointed for the Kings service, so that he who hath the pay of five, or six thou∣sand, must alwayes have one thousand in rea∣dinesse, or more, according to the Kings need of them, and so in proportion all the rest which enables them on a sudden to make up the num∣ber, at the least of <HI>two hundred thousand horse,</HI> of which number, they have alwayes at hand one hundred thousand to wait upon the King wheresoever he is.</P>
<P>There are very many private men in Cities and Towns, who are Merchants, or Trades∣men that are very rich, but it is not safe for them that are so, so to appear, least that they should be used as <HI>fill'd sponges.</HI></P>
<P>But there is never a Subject in that Empire, who hath <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>inheritance,</HI> which he may
<PB N="412" REF="225"/>
call his own, but they are all Tenants at the will of their King, having no other <HI>title</HI> to that they enjoy besides the Kings favour, which is by far more easily lost than gotten; It is true that the King advanceth many there, unto ma∣ny great honours, and allows them as before, marvelous great revenues, but no Son there en∣joyes either the Titles, or means of his Father that hath had Pensions from that King, for the King takes <HI>possession of all</HI> when they are dead, appointing their Children some competent means for their <HI>subsistence,</HI> which they shall not <HI>exceed,</HI> if they fall not into the Kings affe∣ction as their Fathers did, wherefore many great men in this Empire live up to the height of their means, and therefore have a very nume∣rous train, a very great retinue to attend upon them, which makes them to appear like Prin∣ces, rather than subjects.</P>
<P>Yet this their necessary dependance on their King binds them unto such base subjection, as that they will yield with readinesse unto any of his unreasonable and wilfull commands. As <HI>Plutarch</HI> writes of the Souldiers of <HI>Scipio, nullu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> est horum, qui non conscensâ turri semet in mare praecipitaturus, si jussero,</HI> that there was never a one in his Army, by his own report, that would not for a word of his mouth, have gone up into a Tower, and cast himself thence head-long into the Sea, and thus the people here will do
<PB N="413" REF="225"/>
<HI>thing the King commands them to do;</HI> so that if he bid the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her to lay hands of violence upon his Son, or the Son upon his Father, they will do it, rather than the will of their King should be disobeyed. Thus forgetting Nature, rather than Subjection.</P>
<P>And this tye of theirs (I say) upon the Kings favour makes all his Subjects most servile flat∣terers, for they will commend any of his actions, though they be nothing but cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty, so any of his speeches, though nothing but folly. And when the King sits and speaks to any of his people publickly, there is not a word falls from him that is not written by some Scr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veners, or Scribes that stand round about him.</P>
<P>In the year 1618. when we lived at that Court, there appeared at once in the Moneth of <HI>November</HI> in their <HI>Hemisphear</HI> two great <HI>Blazing-stars,</HI> the one of them, <HI>North,</HI> the other <HI>South,</HI> which unusual sight appeared there for the space of one Moneth. One of those strange Comets in the <HI>North,</HI> appeared like a long <HI>blazing Torch,</HI> or <HI>Launce fired</HI> at the up∣per end, the other in the <HI>South,</HI> was round like a <HI>pot boyling out fire.</HI> The <HI>Mogol</HI> consulted with his flattering <HI>Astrologers,</HI> who spake of these Comets unto the King, as <HI>Daniel</HI> some∣times did of <HI>Nebuchadnezzars</HI> dream, <HI>Dan. 4. 19. My Lord, the dream is to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof unto thine
<PB N="414" REF="226"/>
Enemies.</HI> For his <HI>Astrologers</HI> told him that he needed not trouble himself with the thought thereof, for it concerned other <HI>places</HI> and <HI>peo∣ple,</HI> not <HI>him</HI> nor <HI>his.</HI> But not long after this, their <HI>season</HI> of <HI>Rain,</HI> (before spoken of) which was never known to fail till then, failed them, and this caused such a famine and mortality in the <HI>South parts</HI> of his Empire, that it did very much unpeople it, and in the <HI>Northern</HI> part thereof (whether the <HI>Mogol</HI> then repaired) his third Son <HI>Sultan Caroom</HI> raised, and kept to∣gether very great forces, and stood upon his guard, and would not disband, till his Father had delivered his eldest Son <HI>Sultan Coobseroo</HI> into his hands, and how, when he had him in his power he used him, you shall after hear.</P>
<P>In the mean time, take one admirable ex∣ample of a very grosse flatterer, but a great fa∣vourite of that King, who was noted above o∣thers of that Nation to be a great neglecter of God, believing it Religion enough to please the <HI>Mogol</HI> his Master. This man was a Souldier of an approved valour: But upon a time he sitting in <HI>dalliance</HI> with one of his Women, she pluckt an <HI>hair</HI> from his <HI>breast</HI> (which grew about his <HI>Nipple)</HI> in wantonnesse, without the least thought of doing him hurt. But the little wound, that small, and unparalel'd instrument of death <HI>made,</HI> presently began to <HI>fester,</HI> and in short time after became a <HI>Canker</HI> incureable;
<PB N="415" REF="226"/>
in fine, when he saw that he must needs dye, he uttered these words, which are worth the re∣membring of all that shall ever hear them, say∣ing:</P>
<P><HI>VVho would not have thought but that I, who have been so long bred a Souldier, should have dyed in the face of mine Enemy, either by a sword, or a Launce, or an Arrow, or a Bullet, or by some such instrument of death: But now (though too late) I am forc'd to confesse that there is a great God above, whose Majesty I have ever despised, that needs no bigger Launce than an hair to kill an Atheist, or a despiser of his Majesty,</HI> and so, desiring that those his last words might be told unto the King his Master, died.</P>
<Q><L>Till sin into the world had made a breach,</L>
<L>Death was not heard of: ever since in each</L>
<L>Poor creature may it, doth it couchant lye,</L>
<L>The kernel of a Grape kills one; a fly</L>
<L>Another choaks; by a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrupted breath</L>
<L>Of air one dies; and others have found death</L>
<L>In a small bit of meat; or by a Corn</L>
<L>Too closely cut, or by a prick of Thorn.</L>
<L>When death comes arm'd with Gods imperial word,</L>
<L>An hair can pierce as deep as sharpest sword.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> never advanceth any, but he gives him a new name, and these of some pret∣ty signification; as <HI>Pharoah</HI> did unto <HI>Joseph,</HI> when he made him great in his Court, <HI>Gen.</HI> 41.
<PB N="416" REF="227"/>
45. the new names (I say) that the <HI>Mogol</HI> gives unto those he advanceth and favours are significant. As <HI>Asaph Chan,</HI> the gathering or rich Lord, whose sister the <HI>Mogol</HI> married, and she was his most beloved wife, and her bro∣thers marvelous great riches, answered his name, for he died worth many Millions (as I have been credibly informed) the greatest sub∣ject (I believe) for wealth that ever the world had: so another of the <HI>Mogols Grandees</HI> was called <HI>Mahobet-Chan,</HI> the beloved Lord. An∣other <HI>Chan-Jahan,</HI> the Lord of my heart. An∣other <HI>Chan-Allaam,</HI> the Lord of the world. Another <HI>Chan-Channa,</HI> the Lord of Lords. He called his chief Physician <HI>Mocrob-Chan</HI> the Lord of my health; and many other names like these his <HI>Grandees</HI> had, which at my being there belonged to his most numerous Court.</P>
<P>And further for their Titles of honour there, all the Kings <HI>Children</HI> are called <HI>Sultans,</HI> or Princes; his daughters <HI>Sultanaus,</HI> or Princesses, the next title is <HI>Nabob</HI> equivalent to a <HI>Duke,</HI> the next <HI>Channa,</HI> a double <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Earle.</HI> The next <HI>Chan,</HI> a <HI>Lord.</HI> So <HI>Meirsa</HI> signifies a <HI>Knight</HI> that hath been a General, or Comman∣der in the Wars. <HI>Umbra,</HI> a Captain; <HI>Haddee,</HI> a Cavalier, or Souldier on horse-back, who have all allowed them means by the King (as be∣fore) proportionable for the supports of their Honours, and Titles, and Names.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="227"/>
His Officers of State are his Treasurers, which receive his revenues in his several Pro∣vinces, and take care for the payment of his great Pensions, which, when they are due, are paid without any delay: There his chief Eu∣nuchs (which command the rest of them) take care for the ordering of his house, and are Stew∣ards and Controulers of it; his Secretaries, the Masters of his <HI>Elephants;</HI> and the Masters of his Tents are other of his great Officers, and so are the keepers of his <HI>Ward-robe,</HI> who are en∣trusted with his <HI>Plate</HI> and <HI>Jewels.</HI> To these I may add those which take care of his Customs for goods brought into his Empire, as for com∣modities carried thence. But these are not ma∣ny, because his <HI>Sea-ports</HI> are but few. The Cu∣stoms payd in his Ports are not high, that stran∣gers of all Nations may have the greater encou∣ragement to Trade there with him, but as he expects money from all strangers that Trade there: So it is a fault he will not pardon (as be∣fore) for any to carry any quantity of silver thence. He hath other Officers that spread over his Empire, to exact monies out of all the la∣bours of that people who make the curious ma∣nufactures. So that like a great Tree he receives nourishment from every, even the least Roots that grow under his shadow, and therefore though his Pensions are exceeding great (as be∣fore) they are nothing comparable to his enuch greater revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="228"/>
By reason of that Countries immoderate heat, our <HI>English</HI> Cloath is not fit to make Ha∣bits for that people, that of it w<SUP>ch</SUP> is sold there, is most of it for colour Red, &amp; this they imploy for the most part to make coverings for their <HI>Elephants</HI> and <HI>Horses,</HI> &amp; to cover their <HI>Coaches,</HI> the King himself taking a very great part there∣of, whose payments are very good, onely the Merchant must get the hands of some of his chief Officers to his <HI>bill,</HI> appointed for such dis∣patches, which are obtained as soon as desired. And this the King doth to prevent the abuses of particular, and single persons.</P>
<P>And now that I may present my Reader with the further glory of this great King, I shall lead him where he may take a view.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Mogols</HI> Leskar, or Camp Royal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHich indeed is very glorious, as all must confesse, who have seen the in∣finite number of Tents, or Pavilions there pitched together which in a plain make a shew equal to a most spacious and glorious Citie. These Tents I say, when they are altogether, co∣ver such a great quantity of ground, that I be∣lieve it is five <HI>English</HI> miles at the least, from one side of them to the other, very beautifull to
<PB N="419" REF="228"/>
behold from some Hill, where they may be all seen at once.</P>
<P>They write of <HI>Zerxes,</HI> that when from such a place he took a view of his very numerous Army, consisting at the least of three hundred thousand men, he wept, saying, that in less than the compasse of one hundred years, not one of that great mighty Host would be alive. And to see such company then together of all sorts of people (and I shall give a good reason pre∣sently why I believe that mixt company of men, women, and children may make up such an huge number, as before I named, if not exceed it) and to consider that death will seize upon them all, within such a space of time, and that <HI>the second death hath such a power over them,</HI> is a thing of more sad consideration.</P>
<P>Now to make it appear that the number of people of all sorts is so exceeding great, which here get, and keep together in the <HI>Mogols Les∣kar,</HI> or Camp Royal; first there are one hun∣dred thousand Souldiers, which alwayes wait about that King (as before observed) and all his <HI>Grandees</HI> have a very great train of fol∣lowers and servants to attend them there, and so have all other men according to their several qualities, and all these carry their Wives and Children, and whole family with them, which must needs amount to a very exceeding great number. And further to demonstrate this,
<PB N="420" REF="229"/>
when that King removes from one place to an∣other, for the space of twelve hours, a broad passage is continually fill'd with passengers, and Elephants, and Horses, and Dromedaries, and Camels, and Coaches, and Asses, and Oxen, (on which the meaner sort of men and women with their little Children, ride) so full as they may well passe one by the other. Now in such a broad passage, and in such a long time, a very great number of people, the company conti∣nually moving on forward, may passe.</P>
<P>Thus this people moving on from place to place, it may be said of them, what <HI>Salvian</HI> speaks of <HI>Israel,</HI> while they were in their jour∣ney to <HI>the land of promise,</HI> that it was <HI>Ambu∣lans respublica,</HI> a walking Common-wealth. And therefore that ancient people of God were called <HI>Hebrews,</HI> which signified passengers, and their dwelling so in Tents, signified thus much to all the people of God in all succeeding ages, that here they dwell in moveable habitations, <HI>having no continuing City here,</HI> but they must <HI>look for one, and that is above.</HI></P>
<P>It is observed of <HI>Cain,</HI> that he (a wicked man) was a tiller of the ground, (though that calling of it self deserves much commendation) or as a man fastned to the earth, whereas <HI>Abel</HI> his brother (a man fearing God) was a Shep∣heard, which is a moving, rouling occupation, from one place to another, <HI>thou tellest my flit∣tings,</HI>
<PB N="421" REF="229"/>
saith <HI>David,</HI> Here we often shift our places, and our company, and must do so, our businesses carrying us up and down, to and fro, but our felicity hereafter shall consist in rest, in not changing for ever after, either our compa∣ny, or place, but when the Godly man shall ac∣complish, as an hireling his day, when his work, which God hath appointed him here to do, is done and finished, he shall lye down in peace, and receive his penny, and enjoy his reward.</P>
<P>The Tents pitch'd in that <HI>Leskar,</HI> or Camp Royal are for the most part white, like the cloa∣thing of those which own them. But the <HI>Mo∣gols</HI> Tents are red, reared up upon Poles, higher by much than the other. They are placed in the middest of the Camp, where they take up a very large compasse of ground, and may be seen every way, and they must needs be very great to afford room in them, for himself, his wives, children, women, Eunuchs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the sore-front, or outward part, or Court within his Tent, there is a very large room for accesse to him, 'twixt seven and nine of the Clock at night, which (as before) is called his <HI>Goozulcad.</HI></P>
<P>His Tents are encompassed round with <HI>Ca∣nats,</HI> which are like our <HI>Screenes</HI> to fold up to∣gether; those <HI>Canats</HI> are about ten foot high, made of narrow strong <HI>Callico,</HI> and lined with the same, stiffened at every breadth with a <HI>Cane,</HI>
<PB N="422" REF="230"/>
but they are strongest lined on their outside by a very great company of <HI>arm'd Souldiers,</HI> that keep close about them night and day. The Tents of his great men are likewise large, placed round about his. All of them throughout the whole <HI>Leskar</HI> reared up in such a due and con∣stant order, that when we remove from place to place, we can go as directly to those move∣able <HI>dwellings,</HI> as if we continued still in fixed and <HI>standing habitations,</HI> taking our direction from several <HI>streets</HI> and <HI>Bazars,</HI> or Market places, every one pitched upon every remove alike, upon such, or such a side of the Kings Tents, as if they had not been at all removed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> (which I should have observed before) hath so much wealth, and consequent∣ly so much power, by reason of his marvelous great multitudes of fighting men; which he al∣wayes keeps in Arms, commanding at all times as many of them as he please, that as the <HI>Moabites</HI> truely said of <HI>Israel,</HI> (while they had Almighty God fighting with them, and for them) so it may be said of him (if God restrain him not) that his huge Companies are able to <HI>lick up all that are round about him, as the Oxe licketh up the grasse of the field,</HI> Numb. 22. 4.</P>

But that which here seemed unto me to be most strange, was, that notwithstanding our marvelous great company of men, women; and children there together, that must all be fed, and the very great number of other Crea∣tures which did eat Corn, as we never there wanted water: so, we had so many victualers with us, and so much provision continually brought in unto us, that we never felt there the want of any thing beside, but had it at as low rates as in other places.</P>

could never see any of them, I shall here take the liberty to speak somewhat I have heard and do believe:</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Mogols</HI> wives and women; where something of his Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHom I conceive to be Women of good feature, though for their colour very swart, which that people may call beauty, it being the complexion of them all, as the <HI>Crow</HI> thinks his bird fairest, but (as before) I never observed any crooked, or deform'd per∣son of either sex amongst them: For the honesty of those great mens Wives and Women, there is such a quick eye of jealousie continually over them, that they are made so by force, though (as they say) they are never much regarded by those great ones after the very first, and prime of their youth is past.</P>
<P>For that great Monarch the <HI>Mogol</HI> in the choise of his Wives and Women, he was guided more by his eye and fansie, than by any re∣spect had to his honour, for he took not the daughters of neighbouring Princes, but of his own subjects, and there preferr'd that, which he looked upon as beauty, before any thing else.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="232"/>
He was married to four Wives, and had Con∣cubines, and Women beside (all which were at his command) enough to make up their num∣ber a full thousand (as they there confidently affirm'd.) And that he might raise up, his beast∣ly and unnatural lusts, even to the very height, he kept boyes as before <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>His most beloved wife (when I lived at his Court) he called <HI>Noor-Mahal,</HI> which signified the <HI>light of the Court,</HI> and to the other of his Wives, and Women, which he most loved, he gave new names unto them, and such names as he most fancied.</P>
<P>For his Wife I first named, he took her out of the dust, from a very mean family, but how∣ever, she made such a through conquest on his affections, that she engrossed almost all his love, did what she pleased in the Government of that Empire, where she advanced her brother <HI>Asaph-Chan;</HI> and other her nearest relations, to the greatest places of Command and Ho∣nour, and profit in that vast Monarchy.</P>
<P>Her brother <HI>Asaph-Chan</HI> was presently made one of the <HI>Starres</HI> of the first <HI>Magnitude</HI> that shined in that <HI>Indian Court,</HI> and when he had once gotten, so kept the <HI>Mogols</HI> favour by the assistance of his sister <HI>Noor-Mahal,</HI> that by the Pensions given, and many Offices bestowed on him, he heaped up a Masse of Treasure above all belief (as before) and married his daughter un∣to <HI>Sultan Caroom,</HI> who is now King.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="233"/>
The <HI>Mogol</HI> of all his so many Wives and Concubines had but <HI>six</HI> Children, five Sons and one Daughter. The names he gave his Chil∣dren, and others were names that proceeded from Counsel (as he imagined) rather than chance. His eldest Son was called <HI>Sultan Coob∣surroo,</HI> which signified the Prince with the <HI>good face,</HI> his person and beauty answered his name, for he was a Prince of a very lovely presence. His second Son he called <HI>Sultan Perum,</HI> Prince of the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> or <HI>of the sweet influences of the</HI> Pleiades. His third Son (now King) though that great dignity was never intended to him by his Father, was called <HI>Sultan Caroom,</HI> or the Prince of bounty. His fourth <HI>Sultan Sha∣har,</HI> or the Prince of <HI>fame.</HI> His fift, and last Son was called by him <HI>Sultan Tauct, Tauct</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> tongue, signifies a <HI>Throne,</HI> and he was named so by the King his Father, because the first hour he sat peaceably on his Throne, there was news brought him of that Sons birth.</P>
<P>The first Son of that King, which he hath by any of his <HI>married wives,</HI> by prerogative of birth, inherits that <HI>Empire,</HI> the eldest Son of every man (as before) called there <HI>(the great brother.)</HI> And he that inherits that Monarchy, doth not openly slaughter his younger brothers, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do; yet it is observed, that few younger brothers of those <HI>Indostan</HI> Kings have long <HI>survived</HI> their <HI>Fathers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="233"/>
Yet notwithstanding that long continued custom there for the eldest Son to succeed the Father in that great Empire; <HI>Achabar Sha,</HI> Fa∣ther of that late King; upon high &amp; just displea∣sure taken against his Son, <HI>for climbing up unto the bed of Anarkelee,</HI> his Fathers most beloved Wife (whose name signified the <HI>Kernel</HI> of a <HI>Pomegranate)</HI> and for other base actions of his, which stirred up his Fathers high displea∣sure against him, resolved to break that ancient custom, and therefore often in his life time pro∣tested, that not he, but his Grand-childe <HI>Sultan Coobsurroo,</HI> whom he always kept in his Court, should succeed him in that Empire.</P>
<P>And now by the way, the manner of that <HI>Achabar Sha</HI> his death (as they report it in <HI>India)</HI> is worthy observation. That wicked King was wont often to give unto some of his Nobles (whom upon secret displeasure he meant to destroy) <HI>Pills</HI> prepared with <HI>Poison</HI> that should presently put them into incurable dis∣eases. But the last time he went about to pra∣ctise that bloudy treachery, he died himself by his own instrument of death, for then having two <HI>Pills</HI> in his hand, the one very like the o∣ther; the one <HI>Cord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll</HI> for himself, the other <HI>Corrasive,</HI> for one of his <HI>Grandee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> he meant to purge, and flattering him with many proffers of courtesie before he gave him the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, that he might swallow it down the better, at last have∣ing
<PB N="430" REF="234"/>
held them both in the palm of his hand long, by a mistake <HI>took the poysoned Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him∣self,</HI> and gave him the other, which Pill put the King immediately into a mortal <HI>flux of bloud,</HI> which in few dayes put an end to his life in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itie <HI>Lahore.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Achabar Sha</HI> thus dead. <HI>Sultan Coobsurroo</HI> his Grand-Childe, then aged about twenty years, took his opportunity at the first bound, and ascended the Regal Throne at <HI>Lahore,</HI> where by a general Acclamation of that very great and populous City he was pronounced, and acknowledged King. His Father (the late <HI>Mogol)</HI> was thus acknowledged at <HI>Agra.</HI> Two great Armies were presently levied, and meet together to decide the controversie, and the generality of the people within that Em∣pire, thinking it meet that the Father should be King before the Son, clave by far, more to him then to his Son, by which means <HI>Sultan Coob∣surroo</HI> was defeated and taken prisoner, and a very great many of young Gallants with him, whereof his Father immediately after caused to
<PB N="431" REF="234"/>
be <HI>impaled,</HI> or put upon <HI>Stakes</HI> (that most cruell and tormenting death) eight hundred in two severall ranks in one day, without the City <HI>Lahore,</HI> and then carried his Son most disgracefully through them, <HI>bidding him to behold the men in whom he trusted.</HI> His Son told him that he should have serv'd him so, and spared the other, who did nothing in that a∣ction but upon his command; his Father re∣plyed that he could serve him so presently if he so pleased) his Son, wild and desired him so to do, telling his Father that he had no joy at all to live, after the beholding of so many gal∣lant men dead. Notwithastanding, the King spared his life, casting him into Prison where his eyes were sealed up (by something put be∣fore them which might not be taken of) for the space of three years, after what time that seal was taken away, that he might with freedom enjoy the Light, though not his Liberty. And after his Father had taken him out of Prison, he kept him alwaies near about him, but with a very strong guard upon him, so that he fol∣lowing the King his Father in his Progresses, we sometimes saw him. And once he called my Lord Ambassadour to him as we passed by him, asking him many questions, as how far distant our Country was from them, and what we brought thither, and what we carried thence, and how the King his Father had u∣sed
<PB N="432" REF="235"/>
him since his arrive there, whither or no he had not bestowed upon him some great gifts. The Ambassadour told him that his business there was to obtain a free trade for his Nation the English, and that being granted him, he had reward enough. The Prince replyed that this could not be denyed us, we coming so far to trade there with him; and the Prince further asked him how long he had been there, the Ambassadour told him about two years, the Prince replyed again, that it was a very great shame for the successor of <HI>Tamberlane,</HI> who had such infinite Rules, to suffer a man of his quality to come so far unto him, and to live so long about him, and not to give him some Royall gift; and he further added that for himself he was a Prisoner, and therefore could do him no good but he would pray for him, and so he departed.</P>
<P>For that Prince, he was a Gentleman of a very lovely presence and fine carriage, so excee∣dingly beloved of the common people, that as <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tonius</HI> writes of <HI>Titus,</HI> he was <HI>Amor &amp; Deliciae,</HI> &amp;c. the very love and delight of them. Aged then about thirty and five years. He was a man who contented himself with one wife, which with all love and care accompanied him in all his streights, and therefore he would never take any wife but her self, though the liberty of his Religion did admit of Plurality.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="235"/>
It was generally beleeved to be the intent of his Father (for he would often presage so) to make this Prince his first-born his successor, though for the present out of some jealousie (his being so much beloved of the people) he de∣nyed his liberty.</P>
<P>His Fathers love, brings upon him the ex∣tream hatred of his Brother <HI>Caroom</HI> the <HI>Mo∣gals</HI> third Son, who then lived in very great Pomp and splendor at that Court, ayming at that Empire, to which end he put many jea∣lousies into his Fathers head (now grown in years) concerning his Brother <HI>Coobsurroo,</HI> and that his Father might live more secure and out of all present fear of him, if he so pleased, upon which insinuations, partly by force (as I ob∣served before) and partly by intreaty of friends about the King, he was by the King put into the Cruel hand of his Brother <HI>Caroom,</HI> who told his Father that he would have both his eyes upon him, and further so provide, that he should never have cause to fear him any more, and he was as good as his word, for presently after he had gotten possession of him (tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh his Father had given him as great a charge as possibly he could to use him well, and to keep him honourably, and by no means to hurt him, which was all promised by <HI>Caroome,</HI> to be faithfully observed) he caused his second Bro∣ther <HI>Sultan Parveen</HI> to be poysoned, and not
<PB N="434" REF="236"/>
long after that, strangled that most gallant Prince his eldest Brother, which did so trouble his Father, that the grief thereof (as it was strongly beleeved) shortned his days, who not long after this (much against his mind) made room for that murderer to succeed him in that Empire, who layd the foundation of his high advancement, in the blood of his Bro∣thers, and rather than he would have missed it, would certainly made a way through the blood of his Father likewise, All Laws of honesty, of Nature by him thrown down, trampled under foot, forgotten and made void to compass and gain his most unjust ends, as if he resolved to practise that language which <HI>Polynices</HI> out of the height of Ambition spake in the Tragedy</P>

<P>WHich I shall here insert, and in some mea∣sure shew, by a Copy of a Letter writ∣ten by the great <HI>Mogol</HI> unto King <HI>James</HI> in the Persian tongue here faithfully translated, which was as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>UNto a King rightly descended from his an∣cestors, bred in Military affairs, clothed with honour and Justice, a Commander worthy of all Command, strong and constant in the Re∣ligion, which the great Prophet Christ did teach King</HI> James, <HI>whose love hath bred such an impression in my thoughts, as shall never be forgotten, but as the smell of Amber, or as a Garden of fragrant flowers, whose beauty and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dour is still increasing: so be assured my love shall still grow and increase with yours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Letters which you sent me in the be∣half of your Merchants I have received, where∣by I rest satisfied of your tender love towards me, desiring you not to take it ill, that I have not wrote to you her etofore, this present Letter I send you to renew our loves, and herewith do certifie you, that I have sent forth my</HI> Fir∣maunes
<PB N="437" REF="237"/>
<HI>throughout all my Countries to this effect, that if any English Ships or Merchants shall arrive in any of my Ports, my people shall permit and suffer them to do what they please, freely in their Merchandizing causes, aiding and assisting them in all occasion of injuries that shall be offered them, that the least cause of discourtesie be not done unto them, that they may be as free, or freer than my own people.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as now, and formerly, I have received from you divers tokens of your love: so I shall still desire your mindfulness of me by some No∣velties from your Countries, as an argument of friendship betwixt us, for such is the custome of Princes here.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And for your Merchants I have given ex∣press order through all my dominions, to suffer them to buy, sell, transport, and carry away at their pleasure, without the let or hinderance of any person whatsoever, all such goods and Mer∣chandizes as they shall desire to buy, and let this my Letter as fully satisfy you in desired Peace and love, as if my own Son bad been the Mes∣senger to ratifie the same.</HI></P>

<P><HI>WHen your Majesty shall open this Let∣ter, let your Royal heart be as fresh as a small Garden, let all people make reverence at your gate. Let your throne be advanced higher.

<P><HI>The Letters of love and friendship which you sent me, the present tokens of your good affecti∣on towards me, I have received by the hands of your Ambassadour Sir</HI> Thomas Row, <HI>who well deserveth to be your trusted servant, deli∣vered to me in an acceptible and happy hour, upon which mine eyes were so fixed, that I could not easily remoove them unto any other objects, and have accepted them with great joy and delight,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>What followed in both those Letters, was to testifie his care and love towards the English. Now all these Letters were written in the Per∣sian tongue, the Court language there, and their Copies were sent to the Ambassadour, that he might get them translated.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Jesuits sent thither by their Su∣periors to convert people unto Chri∣stianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN that Empire all Religions are tolerated, which make the Tyrannicall Government there more easy to be endured. The <HI>Mogol</HI> would speak well of all of them, saying that a man might be happy, and safe in the profes∣sion of any Religion, and therefore would say that the Mahometan Religion was good, so the Christian Religion good, and the rest good; and therefore by the way,</P>
<P>The Priests or Ministers of any Religion find regard and esteem amongst the people. I shall speak something to this from my own particu∣lar usage there, then very young, while I lived in those parts; yet when I was first there brought into the presence of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> immediatly after my arrive at his Court, I standing near the Ambassadour (for no man there of the greatest quality whatsoever, is at any time suf∣fered
<PB N="441" REF="239"/>
to sit in his presence) and but a little di∣stance from that King in his <HI>Goz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> he sent one of his Grandees to me, to let me know, that the King bad me welcome thither, that I should have a free access to him when ever I pleased, and if I would ask him any thing, he would give it me (though I never did ask, nor he give) and very many times afterward (when waiting upon my Lord Ambassadour) I ap∣peared before him, he would still shew tokens of Civility and respect unto me, and I never went abroad amongst that people; but those that met me upon this consideration, that I was a <HI>Padrae</HI> (for so they call'd me) a Father or Minister, they would manifest in their be∣haviour towards me much esteem unto me. But for the Jesuits there.</P>
<P>There was one of that order in <HI>Goa</HI> (a City of the Portugals lying in the skirts of India) of very much fame and renown called <HI>Jerony∣mo Xauere,</HI> sent for by <HI>Achabar Sha</HI> the late Kings Father in the year 1596. to argue be∣fore him the doctrine of Christianity, there being alwaies present a <HI>Moolaa</HI> or Mahome∣tan Priest, and a third person, who followed no precise rule, but what the light of nature meerly led him to, and these two were to ob∣ject what they could against his reasoning.</P>
<P>The Jesuit in the <HI>Mogols</HI> own language (which was a great advantage to him) began
<PB N="443" REF="240"/>
to speak first of the Creation, and then of the fall of man, in which the Mahometans agree with us.</P>
<P>Then he layd down divers grounds to bot∣tom his reasonings on.</P>
<P>That man by Creation was made a most excellent Creature, indued with the light of reason, which no other sublunary Creature be∣sides himself had; then</P>
<P>That man thus endued, must have some rule or Law to walk by, which he could not prescribe unto himself, and therefore it must be given him from above.</P>
<P>That this Law was first given unto man from God, and afterward confirmed by Pro∣phets sent into the world, in divers ages from God.</P>
<P>That this Law thus delivered must needs be one Law, in all things agreeing in it self. And so did not the Law of Mahomet.</P>
<P>That this thus delivered was most confor∣mable to right reason; And so was not the Law of Mahomet.</P>
<P>That man fall'n from God by Sin was not able to recover himself from that fall, and therefore it was necessary that there should be one, more than a man to do it for him, and that that one could not be Mahomet.</P>
<P>That this one was, Christ God, as well as man, God to satisfie (the Mahometans them∣selves
<PB N="442" REF="240"/>
confessing that Christ was the breath of God) and man to suffer death as he did.</P>
<P>That Christ the Son of God coming into the world, about that great work of satisfy∣ing Gods anger against man for sin, it was ne∣cessary that he should live a poor and labori∣ous life here on Earth (at which the Maho∣metans much stumble) and not a life that was full of pomp, and pleasure, and delicacie.</P>
<P>That the Gospel of Christ, and other holy Books of Scripture, which the Christians re∣tain and walk by, contain nothing in them that is corrupt and depraved; But there is very much to be found in their Alcaron which is so.</P>
<P>That the great worth and worthiness shining in the person of Christ, was by far more ex∣cellent than any thing observable in Mahomet (for they themselves confess that Christ lived without sin, when Mahomet himself acknow∣ledgeth, that he had been a filthy person.)</P>
<P>That the feigned and foolish, and ridicu∣lous miracles, which they say were done by Mahomet, were nothing comparable to the miracles done by Christ, who (as the Maho∣metans confess) did greater miracles than ever were done before or since him.</P>
<P>That there was a great deal of difference in the manner of promulgating the Gospel of Christ, into the world, and the introducing of the Laws of Mahomet.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="241"/>
That Christ hath purchased Heaven for all that beleeve in him, and that Hell is prepared for all others that do not rely on him, and on him alone for Salvation.</P>
<P>There were many more particulars besides these, which that <HI>Jeronymo Xaucere</HI> laid down before the <HI>Mogol</HI> to ground his arguments on, which that King heard patiently at severall times during the space of one year and half, but at last he sent him away back again to <HI>Goa</HI> honourably, with some good gifts be∣stowed on him, telling him as <HI>Felix</HI> did, after he had reasoned before him, <HI>that he would call for him again when he had a convenient time,</HI> Acts 24. 25. Which time or season neither of them both ever found afterward.</P>
<P>These particulars which I have here inser∣ted (with many more I might have added to them, upon all which that <HI>Jeronymo Xaucere</HI> enlarged himself before the <HI>Mogol</HI> in his ar∣guings before him) were given unto me in La∣tine by <HI>Francisco Corsi,</HI> another Jesuit resident at that Court, while I was there, and long be∣fore that time. And further I have been there told b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other people professing Christianity in that Empire, that there was such a dispute there held, and for my part do beleeve it.</P>
<P>For that <HI>Francisco Corsi</HI> he was a <HI>Floren∣tine</HI> by birth, aged about fifty years, who (if he were indeed what he seemed to be) was a
<PB N="445" REF="241"/>
man of a severe life, yet of a fair and an affa∣ble disposition: He lived at that Court, as an Agent for the Portugals, and had not onely free access unto that King, but also encourage∣ment and help by gifts, which he sometimes bestowed on him.</P>
<P>When this Jesuit came first to be acquain∣ted with my Lord Ambassadour, he told him that they were both by profession Christians, though there was a vast difference betwixt them in their professing of it. And as he should not go about to reconcile the Ambassadour to them: So he told him that it would be labour in vain if he should attempt to reconcile him to us. Onely he desired, that there might be a fair correspondency betwixt them, but no dis∣putes. And further his desire was that those wide differences 'twixt the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> and us might not be made there to appear, that Christ might not seem by those differences to be di∣vided amongst men professing Christianity, which might be a very main obstacle, and hin∣derance unto his great design and endeavour, for which he was sent thither, to convent peo∣ple unto Christianity there. Telling my Lord Ambassadour further, that he should be ready to do for him all good offices of love and ser∣vice there, and so he was.</P>
<P>After his first acquaintance, he visited us often, usually once a week. And as those of
<PB N="446" REF="242"/>
that society, in other parts of the world are ve∣ry great intelligencers: so was he there know∣ing all news which was stirring and might be had, which he communicated unto us.</P>
<P>And he would tell us many stories beside, one of which, if true, is very remarkeable. And it was thus; there are a race of people in East India, the men of which race have (if he told us true) their right legges extraordinary great and mishapen, their left legges are like other mens. Now he told us, that they were the po∣sterity of those who stamped St. <HI>Thomas the Apostle to death,</HI> come thither to Preach the Gospel, and that ever since the men of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> race have, and onely they of that Nation, that great deformity upon them. Some few people I have there seen of whom this story is told, but whither that deformity be like <HI>Gehiza</HI>'s leprosie, hereditary, and if so, whither it fell upon that people upon the occasion before na∣med, I am yet to learn.</P>
<P>The Jesuits in East-India (for he was not alone there) have liberty to convert, any they can work upon, unto Christianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath thus far declared, that it shall be lawfull for any one, perswaded so in conscience, to become a Christian, and that he should not by so doing lose his favour.</P>
<P>Upon which, I have one thing, here to in∣sert, which I had there by report (yet I was bid
<PB N="447" REF="242"/>
to beleeve it and report it for a truth) concer∣ning a Gentleman of quality, and a serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> who upon some convicti∣ons wrought upon him (as they say) would needs be Baptized and become a Christian. The King hearing of this convert sent for him, and at first with many cruell threats comman∣ded him to renounce that his new profession, the man replyed that he was most willing to suffer any thing in that cause, which the King could inflict.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> then began to deal with him another way, asking him why he thought him∣self wiser than his fore-Fathers, who lived and dyed Mahometans, and further added many promises of riches and honour, if he would re∣turn to his Mahometism, he replyed again as they say (for I have all this by tradition) that he would not accept of any thing in the world so to do; The <HI>Mogol</HI> wondring at his con∣stancy told him, that if he could have frigh∣ted, or bought him out of his new profession, he would have made him an example for all wa∣verers; but now he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perceived that his resolu∣tion indeed was to be a Christian, and he bid him so continue, and with a reward dischar∣ged him.</P>
<P>The late <HI>Mogol</HI> about the beginning of his reign, caused a temple to be built in <HI>Agra,</HI> his chief City, for the Jesuits, wherein two of his
<PB N="448" REF="243"/>
younger Brothers Sons were solemnly Bapti∣zed, and delivered into their hands to be tray∣ned up in Christianity, the young Gentleman growing to some stature (after they had had their tuition for some years) desired them to provide them wives out of Christendome fit∣ting their Birth, in which having not suddain content, they gave up their Crucifixes again into the Jesuits hands, and so left them; who had these conjectures upon this their revolt, that either the King their Unkle caused them to be Baptized; to make them more odious to the Mahometans, being so near of his blood; Or else it was his plot to get them beautifull wives out of <HI>Europe,</HI> which himself meant to take if he had liked them.</P>
<P>The Jesuit I last named <HI>Francisco Corsi</HI> upon a time (at our being there) having his house, amongst very many more consumed by a suddain fire, it so was that his wooden Cross, set on a Pole near the side of his house, was not (as he said) consumed. Upon which he pre∣sently repayred to that Court, carried that Cross with him, and told the King thereof. The Prince <HI>Sultan Caroome</HI> (who was no fa∣vourer of the Christians) being then present, and hearing him talk how his Cross was pre∣served, derided him, saying, that it was one of his fabulous miracles, and further added, that he would have a fire presently made before the
<PB N="449" REF="243"/>
King, whereinto he would have that Cross cast, and if it consumed not, his Father himself, and all the people there would presently be∣come Christians, but if it did himself should be burnt with it. The Jesuit not willing to put himself upon so suddain and so hot a tryall, answered that he durst not tempt God, who was not tyed to times, and it might be that Almighty God, would never shew that people that infinite favour to make them Christians, or if he had such a great mercy for them in store, it might be that the time of manifesting it was not yet come, and therefore if he should now submit to that tryall, and Almighty God not please to shew a further and a present mi∣racle, his Religion would suffer prejudice there for ever after and therefore he refused.</P>
<P>It should seem that the Jesuits there do ex∣ceedingly extoll the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which I have gathered from poor people there, natives of that Country, who have often asked Alms of me, when I stirred abroad amongst them, and whereas one hath desired me to give him some relief for Christs sake, there are many who have begged it for the Virgin <HI>Maries</HI> sake.</P>
<P>Well known it is, that the Jesuits there, who like the Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isees, <HI>Mat. 23. 25. that would go Sea and Land to make one Proselyte;</HI> have sent into Christendome many large reports
<PB N="450" REF="244"/>
of their great Conversions of Infidels in East India; but all these boastings are but reports; the truth is that they have there spilt the pre∣cious water of Baptism upon some few Faces, working upon the necessity of some poor men, who for want of means, which they give them, are contented to wear Crucifixes; but for want of knowledge in the Doctrine of Christianity are onely in Name Christians. So that the Je∣suits Congregations there are very thin, con∣sisting of some Italians, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> en∣tertains (by great pay given them) to cut his Diamonds and other Rich stones. And of o∣ther European strangers which come thither, and some few others of the Natives before mentioned. So that in one word I shall speak this more of the Jesuits in East India, that they have there <HI>Templum,</HI> but not <HI>Ecclesiam.</HI></P>
<P>When I lived in those parts it was my earnest desire and daily prayer, to have put my weak hands unto that most acceptable; but hard labour of washing Moors, that the Name of Jesus Christ might have been there enlarged (if God had pleased to honour me so far) by my endeavours. But there are three main and apparent obstacles (besides those which do not appear) that hinder the settlement and growth of Christianity in those parts. First the liber∣ty of the Mahometan Religion given the peo∣ple there in case of Marriage. Secondly, the
<PB N="451" REF="244"/>
most debaucht lives of many coming thi∣ther, or living amongst them who profess themselves Christians, <HI>per quorum latera pa∣titur Evangelium,</HI> by whom the Gospell of Jesus Christ is scandalized, and exceedingly suffers. And lastly the hearts of that people are so confirmed and hardned in their own evill old ways, their ears so sealed up, their eyes so blinded with unbelief and darkness, that onely he, <HI>who hath the Key of</HI> David, <HI>that shuts when no man can open, and opens when no man can shut, can open to them the dore of life.</HI></P>
<P>I have some things more by way of inference to adde unto this relation, which con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eins mat∣ter, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it appears to me,</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of serious, and heedfull, but sad Consi∣derations, which shall be my Corol∣lary, and Conclusion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>DIvers particulars have been already ob∣served in this relation, and I should have taken notice of many more, but that my desire was rather to feed and to refresh, then to cramme and cloy my Reader.</P>
<P>But that I may not so do; while I am pro∣fessing the contrary; for the inferences alrea∣dy put, or those yet to be inserted) which either necessarily or obliquely depend on my story, or those which are more remote from it; I shall at all not despair of my Readers pardon (not∣withstanding my length) if he shall seriously peruse, and carefully improve what he finds here written.</P>
<P>The principall end whereof, was to make this Nation ashamed by many carriages of the Heathens; <HI>As the Jews were provoked to
<PB N="453" REF="245"/>
jealousie by them that were not a people.</HI> Deut. 32. 21. And as God instructs man by the Oxe, and Ass, and Stork, and Turtle, and Crane and Swallow, and by the little Ant, or Pismire, Creatures which are onely sensible<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> much more they may be minded of, and learn the practice of some duties from men, people (though strange and remote) yet endued with reason.</P>
<P>It cannot be denyed, but that there is a spe∣ciall use to be made in a clear sight or inter∣view of Nations Persons, Things. Yet he is the best observer, who strictly and impartially so looks about him, that he may see through himself. That as the Beams of the Sun put forth their vertue, and do good by their re∣flection: so in this case the onely way for a man to receive good, is by reflecting things upon himself.</P>
<P>Therefore it was a very good precept which <HI>Plato</HI> sometimes gave unto his Scholars, when they took notice of any thing bad, or of an evill report which they beheld in others for every one of them presently to ask himself this question, <HI>num ego feci tale? have not I done the like?</HI> A Christian must put the Que∣stion further, in asking his own heart, may not I do the like? for there is nothing so bad acted by one, but another left to himself may com∣mit the same, so long as the seed and spawn
<PB N="454" REF="246"/>
of every sin, the rankness of corruption by rea∣son of the pravity of mans nature, is lodged in every soul.</P>
<P>When the Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> (with tears run∣ning down his Cheeks) told <HI>Hazael</HI> that he should be King, and being so what mischief he should do to <HI>Israel, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he should set their strong holds on fire, slay their young men with the sword, dash their children, and rip up the women with child. Hazael</HI> replyes, but what? <HI>num quid servus tuus Canis? am I thy servant a dog that I should do this great thing?</HI> 2 Kings 8. 3. As if he had said, can I be so forsaken of hu∣manity, as to do such monstrous and prodigious things as these? yet he lived to do them; And so have others to act such things, as they would long before have heard with abhorrency, if they had been told them; doing things in the present, which future times would not beleeve could ever be done. And we shall have cause by fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less to wonder at this, if we consider that the very best in the whole cluster of mankind, left to themselves without curb or rein to keep them in order, may become as base, as bad, as the worst upon earth, as the most wretched in Hell.</P>
<P>Yet to see Nature very much refined in ma∣ny Heathens, and to observe it again to lye so mixt, amongst all its lees and dregs in as ma∣ny, if not in thousands more, of those who
<PB N="455" REF="246"/>
profess themselves Christians (is a thought which cannot pass by those (who love and pray for the increase of Christs kingdom) without much sorrow and sadness to attend upon it.</P>
<P>The Consideration whereof (as of many other things, wherein the due and deserved commendations, even of those very Heathens reflects shame upon us) enforceth me, least I should be like those Bottles, in <HI>Job 34. that were ready to burst for want of vent;</HI> enfor∣ceth me (I say) having my Pen in my hand to expatiate, and to let out my thoughts much further (I confess) than the rules and bounds proper to be observed in an Historicall Narra∣tion can well bear. Yet however, I shall take liberty in this my last Section to enquire into some causes and reasons, why those Heathens compared with us, but a wilderness, should be so fruitfull in many Morall good performan∣ces, and we compared with them a Garden en∣closed, should be so barren and fruitless. And while I shall thus enlarge my self, I would not be looked upon as one altogether out of my way, though I be here found more at home than abroad, more in <HI>England</HI> than <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>This Narrative in some foregoing passages hath taken notice of some Mahometan pre∣cepts, as of others delivered by those Heathens, to be as Rules for their followers to walk by.</P>
<P>Now for the Doctrin of Christianity which
<PB N="456" REF="247"/>
we profess, <HI>it is that which teacheth a man to look for true and eternall happiness by Christ alone, there being no other Name under Heaven given amongst men, whereby they may be saved.</HI> Acts 4. 12. No way under Heaven, but one∣ly by and through Christ Jesus and by him a∣lone. And therefore we must not look after another new way, as for a new Christ, a new passion, a new resurrection or the like. And here Reader let us sit down a little, and suffer our thoughts to be taken up with that, I called before matter of serious, and sad, I and of admirable consideration.</P>
<P>They who have curiously surveyed the world, and the severall Nations which inhabits it, have divided the Inhabitants thereof into thirty parts, whereof nineteen are Heathens; six are Mahometans, and five are Christians, by which account (and I conceive that there is a good proportion in it) if all the people which pos∣sess the whole face of the earth were numbred, there would be but one in six, so much as to bear the name of a Christian. And to make up this Number, we must take in all Christs retainers throughout the world, who do but bear his Name, as well as those which be his household Servants.</P>
<P>As all those poor superstitious blind Abissins in <HI>Ethyopia,</HI> as also all those which inhabite <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the two <HI>Armenia</HI>'s, under the
<PB N="457" REF="247"/>
Tyranny of the Turk and King of <HI>Persia</HI> (of whom something before in my first Section) now with some of those poor souls I have conferred, and could never hear any thing from them unto any purpose, onely they would tell me they were <HI>Christiano's,</HI> but why they were so, I perswade my self that they could not render any thing like a good reason, their whole Christianity, I fear almost all of it, lod∣ged (as before) in their very Name.</P>
<P>To these we must adde the <HI>Russians,</HI> and the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who are most sottishly ig∣norant, for one of their Churchmen, being as∣ked how many Evangelists there were, an∣swered, that he did not well know, but he thought four, and when others have been as∣ked such obvious and easy questions, that a very child might make answer too, they would reply, that they could not give an answer unto it themselves, But God and their great Duke knew all things. Now as they are a most ig∣norant. so are they a most treacherous, pro∣phane, filthy and an Idolatrous people.</P>
<P>But further all those beside that bear the Names of Christians in the world, as the <HI>Ia∣cobites</HI> and the <HI>Maronites</HI> inhabiting <HI>Pale∣stina,</HI> the Greek and the Romish Church, with all others bearing that name, must be added to make up that number before spoken of.</P>
<P>And now to come unto the Reformed
<PB N="458" REF="248"/>
Churches (or rather unto those which call themselves so) how few amongst them are Chri∣stians indeed; who are so in name; when we may run through many Congregations, as the Prophet <HI>Jeremy, was commanded to run through</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5. 1. And not find a man a Christian in earnest and indeed, as well as in Name so.</P>
<P>I confess that it is nothing, or at least no hard matter for a man professing Christianity to act Religion, to play devotion, to appear excel∣lent upon the Stage, as the Pharisees did, to be all for shew, nothing for substance, to af∣fect the praise of men, as the Pharisees did, and to get the praise of men, and this is all Hypocrites can look for. And I know that the worst of men may sometimes be in good moodes. But as good thoughts are long before they come into bad hearts▪ so they continue not long, ma∣king but a through fare in them, being like a Post that passeth by.</P>
<P><HI>Bless me, even me my Father, was wicked</HI> Esaus <HI>request.</HI> No man would ever be mise∣rable, if it were enough for him barely to de∣sire happiness. In the 1 K. 21. you may see <HI>Ahab</HI> upon his knees, but all that he shewed was but the visard of sorrow, not the face, or if the face, not the heart, or if the sorrow of the heart, not the repentance, a sorrow for the judgement, not a repentance for the sin. <HI>The
<PB N="459" REF="248"/>
very Devils houl to be tormented,</HI> and grief is not alwaies a sign of Grace. In the 7 of <HI>Hos.</HI> 14. mention is made of some, <HI>that houl upon their beds, when they do not seek God in their hearts.</HI> And experience tells us, that the har∣dest Flint and Marble will sometimes seem to drop, it being easy to appear good, but hard to be so.</P>
<P><HI>Copia rara bonorum,</HI> they who are good in∣deed are rare Creatures, all good and sound Christians considered together, in respect of those, which are not so, being like Whales in the vast Ocean, <HI>apparent rari nantes,</HI> which are seen rarely (not as other Fishes) but here and there, no where to be seen in Companies. <HI>Or like the shaking of the Olive tree, when the fruit is gathered, Or like the gleaning of Grapes when the vintage is done.</HI> Esay 24. 13. Called by one or two out of a City or tribe. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 4.</P>
<P>Now if we put all this together; as first, that there is no way, no means to attain salvation, but onely in, and through Christ Jesus. Se∣condly that there be very few in the world which do, in respect of those, which do not so much as bear the Names of Christians. Thirdly, amongst those which bear this Name, very few there are (as to men it appears) which shall have benefit by Christ, compared with those that shall not, what shall we say to all
<PB N="460" REF="249"/>
this? even that which the Prophet doth in an∣other Case, <HI>Es. 5. 14. that Hell hath enlarged it self, and opened its mouth above measure.</HI></P>
<P>Alas poor Indians, who live in darkness and in the shadow of death and cannot help it but wo be to Christians, who have light to walk by and will not improve it; for the first of these they cannot know, for the second they care not to know, they will not know, which makes them more excusable, because there is no plea for the willfull.</P>
<P>Many Indians, poor souls! walk in that little light they have, unreproveably in respect of moralites, and doubtless, if they knew bet∣ter, would do better (though I am perswaded, that God will never honour Jesuits so far, as to convert them unto Christianity, notwith∣standing their great brags of their many Con∣verts there) but what can be said in excuse of those, who profess themselves Christians, and live amongst so many clear visions yet even there do so shut up their eyes against their light, as that they know nothing in Religion as they ought to know it.</P>
<P>Therefore, if we leave those Indians a while, and come home unto our selves, who are col∣lectively and together called all Christians, we shall find that the succession of times here amongst us, have very much resembled that Image, <HI>which</HI> Nebuchadnezzar <HI>saw in his
<PB N="461" REF="249"/>
dream.</HI> Dan. 2. whose Head was Gold, Sto∣mack Silver, Belly Brass, Thighs Iron, but the Feet were of Clay, for the lower we descend the worse we are; for it may be truly obser∣ved, that in former times, in which there was by far less knowledge, there was by much more honesty, more honesty in mens dealings with men; and in order then to their duties due un∣to Almighty God, what zeal and care, and constancy did our forefathers shew, while they snatched at the bread of the word, even from the middest of flames, and did seek after it with all their endeavour, while they were surrounded with many perils for so doing. Oh how happy would those esteem themselves to be, if they could but purchase with much price and more hazard, any part or parcell of the New Testament in that language they could understand it, how then would they have so∣laced themselves with that sweet Companion. And if then they were put into Prisons for glorifying God, in the self same prison they glorified him more, and were willing to run as fast to Martyrdom, as people in these days to pleasure, or Covetousness; were as pro∣digall of their lives in the service of God, as o∣thers are of their money now in the service of their lusts, suffering then more willingly for Christ Jesus, than most are now to speak of him, or for him. In these times how many
<PB N="462" REF="250"/>
miles would people have gone to have heard that word of God which they now turn their backs upon, the plenty of Ordinances having made many poor, and long enjoyment of the word, made them wanton with it weary of it, and ready to loath it, as the Israelite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did their Manna, calling it out of contempt <HI>this Manna, Numb.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>Hence, as pampered Bellys, and wanton Palates come to Feasts and Banq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets, where nothing can please but some odd Sauce, or some new invention: so very many come to Ser∣mons, and to the reading of good Books, and will be satisfied with nothing but the vanity and froth of wit, though indeed it can give no satisfaction being like wind in the Stomack, which fills but feeds not. Or they come to hearing the word, as if (like <HI>Malchus</HI> the high Priests servant) they had their right ears strook off, for they hear not with judgement, but sinisterly, and often with prejudice to the person speaking and to the doctrine delivered, be it never so excellent, and he that delivers it of much integrity and desert. Such hearers as these regard not what is solid, substantiall, and of most use to informe the understanding, and to stir up the affections; but that which is delightfull, and pleasant to feed the phancie, with Oylie passages, which like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iddle of the Sun, goes through the wood, and through
<PB N="463" REF="250"/>
the wood, and breaks never a stick, so these through the head, and through the head, and stay not. Now those, who thus hear, are easi∣ly brought to admire every thing they un∣derstand not, as to slight and scorn those plain and wholesome, and profitable truths which are made easy to their understanding. And from this strange lightness and vanity of their minds, they grow into a neglect of the holy Scriptures, those fountains of living water, as of other excellent treatises, which clear and explain them, to wade in Kennels or filthy Puddles. And (as one well observes) commit Idolatry (as it were) with idle or fabulous, or else other dangerous Books. Like <HI>Polician</HI> who prefer'd the Odes of <HI>Pindarus</HI> before the Psalms of <HI>David.</HI> When (if he could have understood so much) he might have found more weight and strength, and wisdom and eloquence in the Holy Scriptures, than in all the writings of the world beside.</P>
<P>And certainly that very great neglect of the Holy Scriptures, hath been the Parent, which hath brought forth so much Athisem amongst us; when people instead of the writings of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Prophets, and Evangelists, and other parts of that most sacred Book, which was wont to lye in their windows, as their best ornament &amp; to sit in their uppermost rooms a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their best Ghest in their houses, there are many
<PB N="464" REF="251"/>
Romances, and other vain and frivolous sto∣ries, which take up their places, much viciating and corrupting the minds of many Readers; who rather than they should want Books, that might afford matter to please and feed their wanton humours, have the Turkish <HI>Alcoran</HI> taught to speak English.</P>
<P>Now from that little love and liking that men have, and bear to the truth, there have proceeded many endeavours of la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to grub, and root up the very foundations of Religion, by turning all fundamentals (which should be received, not controverted) into questions and dispates, as it was in the time of the School∣men about three hundred years last past, that by so doing had almost disputed all Religion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Church then; that being a true maxim, which these times have not well con∣sidered of, <HI>Pruritus disput andi, Religionis scabies,</HI> that the itch of disputing breeds an Ul∣cer or Scab in Religion.</P>
<P>It was never worse in <HI>Israel, than when e∣very one did that which was right in his own eyes,</HI> and this we may take notice of in the 17. 18. 19. and 21. Chapters of <HI>Judges.</HI> And how ill it hath been in this Church where∣in we live, since the Reigns of Discipline have been slackened, or broken, he that hath eyes to see may sadly behold; and he who hath an heart; which holds any pity in it, may bitter∣ly lament.</P>

I have observed that there is very much order to be taken notice of in that remote people, for the better carrying on of things amongst themselves, and they find much outward peace and quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in it, though it be but a disorderly order. But for that Order and Discipline, which is managed and car∣ried on by safe and good Rules, they are so consistent to the well being of a Church or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te, as that they cannot be separated or severed without much damage and de∣triment unto both; Order and Govern∣ment in a State, that may give Rules to, and require obedience from humane Socie∣ties. So <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Discipline</HI> in the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch, which may direct, uphold, encourage and defend people in the profession of Religi∣on. Because Anarchy and confusion must needs stretch, crack and break those Bands asunder, which hold men firmly together in a State; and like a Moth by degrees eats up the life, the very Soul of Religion in the Church.</P>
<P>In the 16. Chapt. of <HI>Numbers, Korah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> with others their com∣plices and adherents (all men of leveling spi∣rits, and consequently enemies to order and Government) rose up and <HI>gathered themselves together</HI> against <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and
<PB N="466" REF="252"/>
said unto them, <HI>you take too much upon you, seeing all the Congregation is holy, every one of them;</HI> And probably upon this false ground thought that they were as good, and therefore it was fit that they should be as great as <HI>Moses: Superiority</HI> is one of the chiefest markes that envy shoots at, and that made these now rise up against their Governours, and they tell them <HI>that all the Congregation was holy,</HI> it had been very well if they had been so, for then these of them would not have so misbehaved them∣selves as they did. But every word they said was false, for what holiness could there be in <HI>Mutinie, disobedience, rebellion</HI> and <HI>irreligion,</HI> if these could make them holy, nothing could make them impure. But why did not those <HI>Rebels</HI> lift up their weapons against <HI>Moses,</HI> as well as their voices? the reason was because they could not, for God hath put such impressi∣ons of Majestie upon the face of lawfull Au∣thority, that wickedness is much confounded, even at the very sight thereof. But what doth <HI>Moses</HI> now? They rose up against him, and he falls down before God, and petitions against them; There is nothing that can be so mischie∣vous to the wicked, as the imprecations of the righteous. <HI>Him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay,</HI> not by <HI>weapons,</HI> but <HI>Prayers;</HI> which prayers of Gods people can reach ungodly men, where no Sword can touch

them, now if it be sad for any (to be so far out of the reach of Prayer) as not to have the Prayers of Gods people put up for them it is by much more grevious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have the petitions of those that can so much prevaile with God, sent up against them. But I return to that I spoke too before.</P>
<P>He that takes notice of the carriage of those <HI>primitive Christians</HI> mentioned in the three first Chapters of the <HI>Acts,</HI> shall ever and anon find <HI>one accord,</HI> and <HI>one assent</HI> to be specified in them, to be spoken of them, how that they were all of one mind, as if they had been all but one man. But in these times wherein we live, the Divell hath cast such a <HI>Ball of contention,</HI> even amongst people professing Religion, that as in the eleventh of <HI>Genesis, division of tongues hindred the building then;</HI> so division of hearts very much hinders the building up of Christia∣nity now.</P>
<P>Come to a Jew, and you shall find how that the principal thing which scares him, and makes him to startle from the Gospel, is the <HI>dissention</HI> of those, which profess it, which he interprets to proceed from the lack of <HI>Unitie</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> in the <HI>foundation</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>And what said the Papists long since (and
<PB N="468" REF="253"/>
it had been well if there had been no truth in it, that <HI>what one preaches in the morning, ano∣ther contradicts after dinner.</HI> And <HI>what peace, what accord in that house</HI> (say they) <HI>where the Husband is a Calvinist, the Wife a Luthe∣ran, or one for</HI> Martin, <HI>the other for</HI> Luther, <HI>the Servant an</HI> Oecolampadian <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These latter times have fitted us with more seve∣ral names of distinction, and enough for a very numerous family, where so many peo∣ple of so many minds do sometimes meet.</P>
<P>They say of Bees, that stir and strife a∣mong them is a signe that their King is a∣bout to leave them, to remove out of the Hive and be gone; Strife and Division in Religion, is a sad presage, that either God hath, or else is about to leave a People. It is a principle in Nature, that <HI>vis unita for∣tior, Strength united receives more strength;</HI> and Experience shews that Planks and Timber well joyned together make a Ship, but disjoyned they cause shipwrack; So connexion of Stones and other materialls make an House, but <HI>dissipation</HI> of them a <HI>ruin;</HI> So Agreement of Christians builds up the Church, Dissention amongst them pulls it down.</P>

well arm'd, and unanimous; unanimity, in the profession of the truth of Religion would make it impregnable.</P>
<P>Division and subdivision are Tearmes that have their use in <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> but they are dan∣gerous to be heard of in Religion. This way therefore, and that judgment, and the other opinion or perswasion, can never repair, but make more breaches still in the Church of Christ, and I fear that much lesse than half an age will make the Church in this Nation most sadly to feel and to rue the truth hereof: for as God is one, so is his will one, and his way one, and oh how happie were it for Christians, if they could get into, &amp; keep in that way. How many exhortations have we in the sacred book to peace and unitie; <HI>live in peace, and the God of peace shall be with you.</HI> How are they re∣proved in scripture that walk disorderly, or are unruly, both Metaphors taken from Soul∣diers that have their severall stations assign'd them, and if they break their rankes it is very dangerous.</P>

name who are the breakers and disturbers thereof in this Church wherein we live, where the connivencie at some, whose opinions were thought lesse dangerous, hath been unhappily made <HI>Genus Generalissimū</HI> from whence all the errors that have been heard of late in this Na∣tion have taken their rise: for while liberty was given to some, it was taken by others, and from hence it is come to passe, that all those Anci∣ent heresies recorded by <HI>Irenaeus</HI> and <HI>Epiphani∣us</HI> and others (which we hoped had been long since buried in forgetfulness) have in these late times of liberty (I say) been raked up out of their corruption, revived, and with new fa∣ces and glosses put upon them, presented to this Nation in Printed booksPunc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and have been preached by some, and applauded by others and defended by more, to the endangering of the very life and soul of Religion, and the utter overthrow of true Godliness here amongst us.</P>
<P>It was well resolved by good and reverend <HI>Calvin, ne decem quidem maria &amp;c.</HI> that it would not grieve him to sayle over ten Seas, about a uniform draught in the profession of Religion.</P>
<P>Other particular men have wished (and I believe most heartily) that all these imper∣tinent, and unprofitable differences about uniformity in the profession of Religion, which so much disturb the peace of the Church of
<PB N="471" REF="254"/>
Christ, were buried in their Ashes.</P>
<P>Oh how many are led away with <HI>per∣verse disputings,</HI> a people of uneven, unquiet unpeaceable and untractable spirits, quite fall'n off from their first Principles, revolted and gone, so wedded to their own opinion, as that there is no reasoning with them, for whatsoever can be said to the contrary, they will be sure to hold their conclusions, they being wiser in their own conceits <HI>than seven men that can render a reason.</HI> And that great opinion they have of their own wisedome; that love and likeing they have to their own false way makes them uncapable either of Counsel, or cure; they peremptorily refusing to return into the way of truth.</P>
<P>Many of these have abundance of error (which proceeds from their own Pride and ignorance) setled in their hearts as So∣lomon saith Pr. 22. 15. <HI>a child hath folly bound up in his heart,</HI> and in regard that all reasonings and disputings in this case with them will do no good, (for we leave them still where we first found them) it were very well for such, and much better for the Church of God in this Nation, if the Rod of Discipline and correction were long enough, and smart enough to drive it thence.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="255"/>
Yet the greater part of these pretend con∣science for what they do, when indeed (as before) it is the Pride of their hearts, the ig∣norance and darkness of their minds, toge∣ther with the perve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sness of their wills, which carries them into, and keepes them in errour.</P>
<P>For the conscience and will they are both lodged together in the same soul, and there∣fore may be easily mistaken, or taken one for the other, as they have often been, and still are by people of this Nation, wherein we live, whence it comes to passe by the <HI>righ∣teous judgment</HI> of Almighty God, that very many here amongst us in these later times have been given up (their sin being part of their punishment) <HI>to believe, and to be led away with lies, because they would not enter∣tain the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>whereas the people in general of those remote parts, honour and reverence a Church∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, and for that very reason because he is so:</HI> these before named <HI>(men of corrupt minds)</HI> cannot endure us who are the called and allowed minister, and publishers of the truth of God and meerely for our office sake, bestowing on us all termes of obliquie and scorn they can possibly invent, esteeming us as that blessed Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> and other good men of his time were accounted by some <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="473" REF="255"/>
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 13. which properly signifieth filth or dirt scraped off mens shoes, <HI>we are made saith the Apostle as the filth of the world, and are the off-scouring of all things unto this day,</HI> as if we were the very offall, or filth of manking, unworthy so much as to have being upon the face of the earth.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas again the Mahometans, and hea∣thens give their Priests not only honour, but cōfor∣table maintenance</HI> &amp; without all grudging; there are very great numbers amongst us, being very much led away by principles of worldly mind∣ed ness &amp; coveteousness, cannot abide us for our maintenance sake, not cōsidering how that they who <HI>preach the Gospel must live by the Gospel,</HI> and that by Divine right we have an honou∣rable maintenance allowed unto us by Al∣mightie God, as it is most cleere by many passages of the <HI>new Testament,</HI> as well as the <HI>Old.</HI> And by the Laws of the Land, wherein we live, we have as great a <HI>civil right</HI> to what we may challenge from the people for our livelihood, as any that would deny it us hath either to his bread, or shirt.</P>
<P>Yet this is contradicted by many, and the reason is, because they do, and will contradict it, we have cause therefore to bless God for good Laws, to direct and lead some, as to con∣strain
<PB N="474" REF="256"/>
and bind others, for there is no hope in this case to work Convictions upon many, such as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> calls <HI>the beasts of the people,</HI> who would defraud us, if they could, of all our just rights. For doubtless if we were left wholy to their curtesie, we might expect no more, probably not so much from them as <HI>Micha gave his Levite</HI> Judg. 17. 10. <HI>ten Shekels of Slver by the year, and a little clothing, and victuals.</HI> Now those <HI>Shekels</HI> were rated diversly, some at fifteen pence, others at twenty pence, and the highest rate of them was two shillings and six pence the <HI>Shekel,</HI> but which of these <HI>Micha</HI> gave his Chap∣len I cannot tell, neither can I say what our people in this Nation, left to themselves, would generally give their Minister by a volun∣tary gift.</P>
<P>But doubtless it would go very hard with many, with most, who if they were left alto∣gether unto their peoples feeding, would speed little better than a yong <HI>Welsh-man</HI> of the university of <HI>Oxford</HI> somtimes did (and I am very certain that the relation is true) who after he had gotten a lambe-skin upon his Shoulders, being Bacheler of Arts, pre∣sently went into the Countrey for preferments, (as he said) and what he found was but four Pounds a year (as he told me) for
<PB N="475" REF="256"/>
reading prayers in a Church, with liberty in the Belfary to teach a few Children, out of which he was to provide himself of food, and cloathing, and all other necessaries. I meeting him some half year after, he told me how he sped, and that it was but small, but small, I asked the poor man further how he did make a shift to live, he told me, that he had been sick of an Ague the greatest part of that time, could take but little food, and if it had not been so with him, his preferment would have starved him. And thus certainly would it be with many others, if they were left for their livelihood meerly to mens cur∣tesies.</P>
<P>Who think the bread of the Church sweet, and therefore would eat it up all from us, and leave us with their good will no part thereof, and happily they may find or ima∣gine it sweet in their mouths, but in their stomacks it will proove hard of digestion. Honey in the one, Gravel in the other, we leave these to God <HI>the righteous judge,</HI> who complaines, <HI>that he is rob'd and wrong'd in the injury done to us. Mat.</HI> 3. 8. And will find a time to reckon with men for all these arrerages, and therefore if repentance and restitution in this case, when wrong hath been done, and after-reformation prevent it
<PB N="476" REF="257"/>
not, they will one day find enough mould in the grave, and enough fire in Hell.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> (as <HI>Valerius</HI> reports) though they were Heathens, yet when <HI>Phydias</HI> was to make for them the jmage of <HI>Minerva,</HI> (which Goddesse as they call'd her, was in very high esteem amongst them) and when that work-man told them that he would make it for them either in Marble, or Ivory, they heard him thus far, but when he further advised them to have it made in <HI>Marble,</HI> because that would be cheapest, they presently commanded him silence, and put him out of doores.</P>
<P>And if Heathens could not endure to entertain the thoughts of cheapness, though but in the making of an Idoll, let them of this Nation blush, and have their faces covered with shame, whoso∣ever they be that love to serve God (as they call it) but to be at as little cost in that service as possibly they can, as if they studied <HI>Jeroboams Politicks,</HI> whose Policie eat up his Religion, who after he had usurped his Kingdom, did invent this taking snare to fasten the people unto him, in giving them some seeming immunity in the profession of Religion, telling them
<PB N="477" REF="257"/>
<HI>that it was too much for them to go to Jerusa∣lem to sacrifice. 1 King.</HI> 12. 28. (though they were commanded so to do by Al∣mighty God) and therefore he set up <HI>Calves,</HI> one in <HI>Dan,</HI> and the other in <HI>Bethel,</HI> that they might stay at home, and serve God better <HI>cheap,</HI> with more <HI>ease,</HI> and (doubtlesse as they were perswaded) with no <HI>less safety.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>further for that people, they do so highly prize those books in which their lawes are written, that they know not how suffici∣ently to esteem and value them, and therefore will not presume to touch them without much reverence.</HI> What shall I say, as to this, unto very-very many of this <HI>Nation,</HI> and such as have long lived under the Ministry of the word, but having profited nothing by it, know not how to put any valuation on it, and therefore esteem it a <HI>trouble,</HI> a <HI>burden,</HI> rather then a blessing or <HI>benefit,</HI> and consequently would be very well content (so they might be freed from all charge to the publishers thereof) if the whole book of God were served <HI>as that roll was,</HI> written by <HI>Baruch</HI> from the mouth of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> the Prophet, <HI>Jer. 36. Cut all in peaces and burnt in the fire.</HI></P>
<P>Such as these will never be perswaded to follow that most excellent counsel which <HI>Solomon</HI> gives, <HI>Prov. 23. 23. Buy the
<PB N="478" REF="258"/>
truth, but sell it not. Buy</HI> it of <HI>God</HI> by <HI>Pray∣er,</HI> buy it of <HI>Books</HI> by <HI>reading,</HI> buy it of <HI>Orthodox</HI> men by hearing, buy it of other <HI>good Christians</HI> by <HI>conferring,</HI> buy it over and over again, you cannot over buy it, <HI>Non Priamus tanti.</HI>—There is nothing in the world to be weighed against it, to be compared with it. <HI>But sell it not for a world.</HI> Yet there are a great many dunghil men of the earth, who with <HI>Aesops</HI> cock prefer a <HI>Barly</HI> Corne before the Pearle, and there∣fore are most unwilling to part with a <HI>Penny</HI> for that most rich <HI>commodity.</HI></P>
<P>It is strange, further to consider (as I obser∣ved before) and is very true, that <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI> should never see their <HI>Alcoran</HI> (though but a fardle of falshoods and fooleries) or hear any part of it read, without a <HI>shew</HI> of great <HI>attention, affection</HI> and <HI>reverence;</HI> and Heathens do so likewise at the hea∣ring of their precepts; and all of them give honour and maintenance which is comfortable and without grudging unto those that be their Teachers: (though they lead them quite out of the way) and <HI>men</HI> dare to usurp the names of <HI>Christians</HI> and yet would be content (I would not be uncharitable in this sad assertion) would be content (I say) so they might be at no charge for hearing the truths of God. If there were no book of God at all ex∣tant,
<PB N="479" REF="258"/>
no Gospel, no Minister to declare and publish it.</P>
<P>But the time will one day come, when people. (if ever they return to a right knowledge of themselves) who have ma∣nifested so much <HI>thrift</HI> in the profession of <HI>Religion,</HI> shal rue and repent the time that ever they did so. When they may desire to see one day more <HI>of the Son of man, one day more of the Gospels,</HI> which they so slighted before, but all in vain. <HI>When distress and anguish commeth upon them, then shall they call upon God, but he will not hear them</HI> &amp;c. the reason follows, <HI>because they hated knowledg. Prov.</HI> 1. 27, 28. &amp;c. because they <HI>hated</HI> and <HI>despised knowledge, as Esau</HI> was said to despise his <HI>birth-right,</HI> because he put no greater <HI>valuation on it.</HI></P>
<P>I confesse that if we whose businesse it is to teach and direct others, do not in the first place labour to <HI>teach</HI> and instruct our <HI>selves.</HI> If we be like the statue of <HI>Mercury</HI> which pointed the way to others while it stood still it selfe; Or like <HI>Watermen,</HI> that look <HI>forward</HI> while they Row and move <HI>backward.</HI> If we seduce or <HI>mis∣lead</HI> our people, by <HI>Error,</HI> or <HI>Exam∣ple;</HI> If we do not manifest <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>mer∣cy,</HI> and <HI>pitty</HI> to our Congregations, but while we undertake the oversight of their <HI>souls,</HI> either silently or else in passion or

<P>But secondly, if in our whole course we <HI>manifest Zeal for God,</HI> Zeal joyned with <HI>knowledge</HI> and carried on with <HI>discre∣tion;</HI> If we <HI>propose</HI> the honour of God as our principal <HI>aim</HI> and <HI>end,</HI> and make <HI>Love, Charity, Long-suffering, Gentlenesse, Good∣nesse, meeknesse, modesty, temperance</HI> to <HI>shine</HI> in our <HI>lives,</HI> that it may be said of us in Particular, <HI>non tantum praedicat sed vivit,</HI> that we <HI>live</HI> as well as <HI>preach;</HI> for then do we <HI>preach</HI> the truths of God as we <HI>should,</HI>
<PB N="485" REF="261"/>
when we endeavour to <HI>live up</HI> unto those duties <HI>our selves</HI> which in our exhortations we <HI>commend to others.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly, if we live though not without <HI>failings,</HI> yet without <HI>scandal,</HI> in not giving any just cause of offence unto others (what∣soever they may <HI>say</HI> or <HI>think</HI> of us) and thus we must labour to live, (&amp; we deserve to suffer without pitty if we do not so) that we may be <HI>inculpabiles</HI> though not <HI>in∣culpati,</HI> not meriting the least <HI>blame,</HI> though we must look to be <HI>blamed</HI> by some, who will not passe a right judgment of us, how good soever our deservings are, the way to heaven being as well through evil as good report; and hence it comes to pass that many times while we are most <HI>faithful</HI> we are most <HI>foully used,</HI> by <HI>scornes</HI> and contumelies put upon us which we must <HI>gather</HI> up, and keep together, as so many <HI>jewels</HI> hereafter to adorn our <HI>Crowns.</HI> In the mean time be very well content to be the <HI>drunkards songs,</HI> rather then their <HI>Compa∣nions:</HI> To <HI>suffer</HI> any wrongs from others rather then <HI>do</HI> the least unto any. To carry chearfully the <HI>reproaches</HI> of wicked men to <HI>heaven,</HI> rather then their <HI>applauses to hell.</HI> In a word if we be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>blamo∣lesse,</HI> though not <HI>sinlesse,</HI> for so we <HI>cannot</HI> be while our bodies are cloathed with <HI>flesh,</HI> but if we walk by <HI>rule,</HI> evenly, carefully,
<PB N="486" REF="262"/>
<HI>Circumspectly,</HI> we are most injuriously dealt withal, if we be denyed any of those re∣spects and encouragements which are due unto us.</P>
<P>And further if there be <HI>no way to attain Salvation but only in and through the merits of Jesus Christ,</HI> all those who presume <HI>to name the Name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> should be∣hold much <HI>beauty in the face of them</HI> which proclame these glad tydings, especially if they consider what fair <HI>Characters</HI> are put upon them by Almighty God both in the <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new Testament.</HI></P>
<P>In the Old Testament called <HI>the strength of a Kingdom, and the excellency of their strength; The Chariots of Israel, and the horsemen thereof, 2 King.</HI> 13. 14. (see <HI>Ezek.</HI> 24. 21.) so it is said of the godly Levites the Ministers of that time, that <HI>they strength∣ned the Kingdom of Judah and made Rehobo∣am</HI> strong 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 11. 17. and so they do all places besides wheresoever they are.</P>
<P>In the new Testament they are called <HI>Ministers of Christ, and stewards of the My∣steries of God</HI> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <HI>Ambassadors for Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 20. &amp;c.</HI> and God hath pro∣mised <HI>to be with</HI> his faithful Ministers and Messengers <HI>alway unto the end of the world.

<P>All which promises well considered and duly regarded, might remove far from us many causes of just complaining which now we have, and may make us take up the complaints of one of the <HI>Ancients</HI> and say, <HI>ad quae tempora reservati sumus,</HI> and to repeat it over and over again, Oh to what times are we reserved: In what daies do we live.</P>
<P>For that people in <HI>East India;</HI> two prin∣cipal causes of their more accurat walking, compared with others, may be these. First because they keep <HI>close</HI> unto those <HI>principles</HI> (most of them founded in the book of Na∣ture) which are given them in charge to <HI>walk by.</HI> And secondly, because the <HI>currant</HI> of justice run very <HI>quick</HI> in these parts (as I have observed before.)</P>
<P>But for us of this Nation, I need not en∣quire into the <HI>causes</HI> and <HI>reasons,</HI> of the most fearful <HI>miscarriages,</HI> and of the many ma∣ny <HI>evils</HI> committed <HI>amongst us,</HI> they lye so open unto every knowing and observing mans understanding, and therefore they want no great discovery. Only I shall take liberty to repeat some of them which are first <HI>more general,</HI> and then those which
<PB N="488" REF="263"/>
are more special and particular.</P>
<P>And first the general and <HI>Principal cause</HI> of all the evil in this, and consequently of every nation under heaven, hath its Ori∣ginal from that <HI>masse of Corruption,</HI> that poysoned <HI>fountain,</HI> which hath infected the whole world, or from that <HI>leaven</HI> which hath sowred the whole <HI>lumps</HI> of mankind. <HI>Ne mali fiant times; Nascuntur.</HI> Every one is <HI>born bad</HI> as well as <HI>becomes so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin</HI> stick∣ing more close to mans <HI>nature</HI> then his <HI>skin</HI> doth to his <HI>flesh.</HI> And that Original guilt like a <HI>fretting leprosie</HI> hath eaten into the <HI>manners</HI> of all, corrupting the whole man, in all the parts of his <HI>body,</HI> and in all the faculties of his <HI>Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Persons</HI> of our first Parents defiled their <HI>Nature;</HI> But ever since the <HI>Nature</HI> of every one defiles his <HI>person.</HI> Whence the hearts of all <HI>are evil from their youth, estran∣ged from the womb,</HI> and <HI>go astray assoon as they are born.</HI></P>
<P>Now secondly, for those <HI>causes,</HI> which are more special and particular of the <HI>in∣crease</HI> and <HI>groweth</HI> of <HI>wickednesse</HI> in this <HI>Na∣tion,</HI> they proceed much from the <HI>want</HI> of <HI>restraint</HI> upon people, who are so natural∣ly apt to <HI>wander</HI> out of the way, that <HI>dare</HI> take any <HI>unfit</HI> and unlawful <HI>liberty</HI> they please to take.</P>
<P><HI>An eye</HI> and a <HI>sword,</HI> make a fit <HI>embleme</HI>
<PB N="489" REF="263"/>
to expresse Magistracy, an eye to observe and watch, and a sword to chastise some, and to support and defend others. But when this <HI>eye</HI> is <HI>dim,</HI> or <HI>sleepy,</HI> then justice must needs <HI>faintly draw</HI> her <HI>breath.</HI> When <HI>Canker</HI> and <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> growes upon the <HI>sword of Authority</HI> for want of use, and thence cries out against him who should otherwaies manage it, <HI>for bearing the sword in vain</HI> (as <HI>Canker and rust doth from the covetous mans silver and Gold, Ia.</HI> 5. 3. and is a witnesse against him,) it is a principal cause why the qualities and <HI>dispositions</HI> of so many people amongst us (who cannot go without a Reine) are so <HI>invaded,</HI> and <HI>vitiated,</HI> nay quite overthrown.</P>
<P>It is a good and a true saying▪ <HI>Qui non vetat peccare cum possit, jubet;</HI> those which are in Power contract the guilt of all those sins upon themselves which they might re∣strain in others <HI>but do not.</HI> The great sin of <HI>Eli</HI> (otherwise a good man) for which he paid dear, because <HI>when his sens made themselves vile he restrained them not, 1 Sam.</HI> 3. 13. All, which the poor indulgent Fa∣ther there saith unto his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wde sons, was, <HI>why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil doings by all the people: nay my sons, for it is no good report that I hear.</HI> When any par∣ties offending deserve if not <HI>death,</HI> yet some severe <HI>smart,</HI> it is not enough to <HI>chide</HI> them, because there must be some <HI>proportion</HI> twixt
<PB N="490" REF="264"/>
the <HI>Punishment</HI> and the <HI>offence.</HI> To give a <HI>light cheek</HI> for a <HI>great offence,</HI> or to award the <HI>stocks</HI> for <HI>theft,</HI> or the <HI>whip</HI> for murder, is to patro∣nize offenders, rather then to punish them.</P>
<P>And further, the <HI>want</HI> of Discipline in the Church since the <HI>hedge</HI> hath been <HI>trampled down</HI> &amp; kept so low about it, hath apparently been the most principal cause of the <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>error</HI> and <HI>heresie</HI> and <HI>Athesme, which hath corrupted so many minds amongst us.</HI></P>
<P>Then thirdly, the very shameful neglect of other publike Persons in their several places, as of <HI>Masters</HI> in their <HI>Families,</HI> of <HI>Parents</HI> to∣wards their <HI>Children,</HI> and lastly of <HI>Ministers</HI> in relation to their <HI>Flocks</HI> have been all of them, and are most sadly mischeivous in this Nation.</P>
<P>I begin with the last I named, <HI>Ministers</HI> of the word, many of which are too too <HI>carelesse</HI> their charges, in taking no considerable <HI>pains</HI> for what they deliver unto their <HI>people,</HI> but on the contrary by <HI>hasty</HI> and undegested meditations, <HI>offer unto God that which cost them nothing;</HI> Or that preach as most hear, resting meerly in the thing done.</P>
<P>And further, there are others much to be <HI>blamed</HI> likewise, in that they do not <HI>study the</HI> people, that so they might apply themselves unto them in all waies of instruction, re∣proof, or comfort. In the last Chapter of <HI>St. Johns Gospel</HI> our blessed Saviour speaks thus
<PB N="491" REF="264"/>
to <HI>Peter</HI> thrice, <HI>Simon Peter, lovest thou me? lovest thou me? lovest thou me?</HI> as if he had said, Dost thou love me? dost thou love me? and dost thou love me indeed? what then? shew thy love to me in this, <HI>feed my lambs, feed my sheep:</HI> I have bestowed my <HI>dearest blood</HI> upon them, do thou <HI>bestow thy best pains.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>wise</HI> and faithful Minister of the <HI>Gospel</HI> must consider that he hath <HI>lambs</HI> in his <HI>flock</HI> as wel as <HI>sheep,</HI> and therefore must fit his dis∣course unto all the <HI>several capacities</HI> of his <HI>hearers,</HI> providing, as <HI>strong meat</HI> for <HI>wel grown</HI> Christians, so <HI>milk</HI> for <HI>Lambs</HI> and <HI>babes.</HI> And he must deale with these <HI>babes</HI> who are but newly entred into the <HI>school of Christ,</HI> as pa∣rents do with their little children when they begin to <HI>spel</HI> or <HI>read,</HI> encourage and praise them, though what they do be not so praise∣worthy: so if he see any the least spark of good in them, to blow it up, and not rigidly shut <HI>the dore of hope against</HI> those, when God keeps it open; nor despise smal, the smallest things in whō <HI>the Image of God</HI> at all appears.</P>
<P>All Congregations then consisting of some very low and weak, as of others of more high and quicker capacities, those who have the o∣versight of them must take special notice of this in applying themselvs unto their several understandings accordingly. Which if so, I think they do very ill who do very much if not altogether neglect the Reading of the
<PB N="492" REF="265"/>
holy Scriptures in their Congregations, as if that were not an <HI>Ordinance of God.</HI> And they are much to be blamed likewise who endea∣vour to feed their people with <HI>Sauce</HI> rather then <HI>food, as Ephraim fed on wind;</HI> Or as that Roman Emperour who seemed to entertain his guests with flesh, and fowles, and fishes of divers kindes, the figures of all which were most exactly counterfeited in thin silver plate with paint put upon it, and presented before them, which they might touch and admire, but they could not tast, and much lesse carry away: so these amuse, trouble, and perplex many of the people whom they undertake to feed, with abstruse passages, or uncooth ex∣pressions, with high speculations, or with aery notions, or with Metaphysical terms, clouding and obscuring many truths, while their businesse is to explain them; for by new and unfit dresses put upon them, they some∣times make truths which are easy in them∣selves, more hard to be understood; and be∣cause they themselves may happily under∣stand their own meanings, conceive that their hearers must do so likewise, as if they were all in the upper form of Christianity, and if they were, would be no more able to under∣stand some passages preached and printed (though some women say that they under∣stand them very well) then the others were to eat of that Emperours dishes.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="265"/>
And as these high exalted notions are very useless (to say no more) in our Preachings, because so few can reach them: so a too∣too much affected plaineness in them, which many times are presented to hearers in such unseemly, and unpleasing, if not absurd ex∣pressions (though I know that there is a lear∣ned plaineness, as well as a plain ignorance) as in probability will never give that infor∣mation to the understanding, nor that mo∣tion and quickning to the affections, as may work upon both, or either. <HI>In all la∣bour there is profit</HI> saith <HI>Solomon Pr.</HI> 14. 23. which as it is true in earthly; so in spirituall things, where the Crown is reserved for the diligent. And to what purpose hath the Spirit and wisdom of God strewed the Ho∣ly Scriptures over with the choicest flowers and figures of Rhetorick, &amp;c. with many full, but short sentences, if they were alto∣gether useless in our Preachings. In which we are commanded to use all arguments we can possibly invent, to perswade men to take Christ and Salvation; and when these perswasions come from our hearts, as well as our heads, the greater pains we then take, and the more our discourses are fur∣nished and set off with Scripture Elegancies, the more succesfull and prevayling we may hope they will prove.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="266"/>
They therefore (as I humbly conceive) judge very rashly, and very much amiss, who in dispensing the word, conclude nothing to be so spirituall, as that which is low, and flat, savouring of very little, or no pains, but is very idly, if not ignorantly performed.</P>
<P>And therfeore as good parts of learning, but above all, much P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety; so there is great wisdom and prudence most requisite to be found in every faithfull Minister of the Gos∣pel, for the better carrying on of his Mini∣steriall Office, the want of which is with∣out doubt, a chief reason why we labour so much in vain, and do no more good in our places.</P>
<P>Which good he that desires to do must be <HI>Carbo &amp; Lampas,</HI> first burning in himself, and then shining unto others. And further he must go in and out before his people, not onely in priority of place, but also in prece∣dency of vertue, and Godliness, encoura∣ging his people in all ways of holiness, not onely by precept but example likewise. And as it is written of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> that he was wont to be not in the rear, but head of his troops, and there spake to his Souldiers, <HI>non ite sed eamus,</HI> not go ye, but let us go: so must Ministers of the Gospel speak unto those in their severall charges, and lead them
<PB N="495" REF="266"/>
so, that they may safely and boldly follow them.</P>
<P>And then, for the comfort of all those, who have been wise and faithfull in this their great trust, and have done the utmost of their endeavours to do much good there∣by; although they have not gained a fair Seal to their Ministry by converting many souls to God, they shall be sure of a full dis∣charge, who have been thus faithfull, what∣soever their success hath been; that when their careless and unprofiting hearers, that he bound over unto the judgement seat of Christ, with this sad testimony against them, <HI>Noluerunt incantari;</HI> this or that people would not be admonished, they shall receive a <HI>Quietus est,</HI> from that great and high Tribunal, which shall speak thus, <HI>well done good and faithfull servant.</HI></P>
<P>A second great cause of the many grow∣ing evils amongst us, proceeds very much from the great neglect and remisness of Masters, or Governours of Families, who do not take care as they might, as they ought to keep in order those under their roofs, and to nurture them up in the fear of the Lord. For examples herein have much power in them to sway either to good or evill. And the greater the example is, the
<PB N="496" REF="267"/>
greater hope if it be good, but if evill the greater danger; for greatness hath ever a train to follow it, either in good or evill. <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> were great examples of good herein, as he that turns to their stories may clearly see.</P>
<P>But on the other side <HI>Jeroboam</HI> is seldom mentioned in the writers of <HI>Israel,</HI> but he draws a tayl after him like a Blazing Star, <HI>Jeroboam</HI> the Son of <HI>Nebat,</HI> who did not onely sin himself, but made <HI>Israel</HI> to sin 1 <HI>K.</HI> 14. 16. by whose high precedency, but evil example, he did exceeding much mischief so defiling his Throne, that if ye look for∣ward upon all the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> his succes∣sors, you shall not find amongst them all one good man. <HI>Omnes ad unum</HI> from <HI>Jeroboam</HI> the first to <HI>Hoshea</HI> the last King of <HI>Israel</HI> they were all nought. Now they who were so bad in the Government of a Kingdom, with∣out doubt could not be good in the well ordering of a family.</P>
<P>And hence let all know that as they may do much good, and consequently reap much comfort, in the true managing of their fa∣milies: so on the contrary they shall be sure one day to suffer, and that heavily for the disorder of them, when they shall be called to a strict account, not onely for their own
<PB N="497" REF="267"/>
sins, but sor the sins of others, under their charge, who by their precedency and exam∣ple they have drawn into, or else by their connivency suffered in wickedness.</P>
<P>A third (and that shall be last cause I will name of so much increase of wickedness in this Nation, and because it is so destructive and mischievous, I shall speak more largely to it) is the great carelesness of Parents in their not looking to their Children in their first institution and breeding; for without all doubt the very sad miscarriages of all sorts of Children, of higher and meaner ex∣traction or descent, proceed very much from their first ordering; when many Parents quite undoe their Children, <HI>stulto &amp; impro∣bo amore;</HI> by reason of their foolish indul∣gence, the great sin of <HI>Eli</HI> (before spoken of) who brought up his Sons to bring down his house; who, for giving them their way too much, was said, <HI>to honour his Sons more than God.</HI> So <HI>David</HI> after him was obser∣ved over much to indulge his Son <HI>Absolon,</HI> when he was young, and to requite him for this ill breeding, <HI>Absolon</HI> lives heavily to vex his Father <HI>Davia</HI> when his Father was old.</P>
<P>The Children of many Parents (especially of great ones) bred when they are young at
<PB N="498" REF="268"/>
home or abroad, are very often left too much unto their own will, to learn or else to do almost what themselves please, when get∣ting few, or no grounds of learning in their youth or non-age, suddainly after many of them travell, and then wanting for the most part good guides for their youth, they be∣ing abroad first see nought, and then be nought, and after all this without speciall mercy, they dye nought.</P>
<P>I do not deny but that there may be ve∣ry many good experiences gaind by travell, but very few do, in respect of those, which do not improve that advantage: whence it often comes to pass, when a great number of these come to write themselves men, be∣ing unable to read Books for want of those principles of learning they might have got∣ten; and unwilling to settle themselves in other good imployments, whereby they might be enabled to give a fair account of their precious time, they often learn to drink, and swear, and rant, and game, and Court Women (to speak it in the mode∣stest sense) or to spoyl good Clothes, they resolving to enjoy the pleasures that are present, as if they had been born to no other end but to sit down, <HI>and to eat and drink, and to rise up to play.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="268"/>
Hence with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose mad youngsters men∣tioned in the book of Wisdom, they say one to another, <HI>Come let us enjoy the good things that are present, let us fill our selves with cost∣ly wine, and let not the flowr of the spring pass by us; let us Crown our selves with rose buds before they be withered, let none of us go with∣out his part of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptuousness▪ let us leave to∣kens of our joyfulness or jollity in every place, for this is our portion, and our lot is this,</HI> leading such lives as the very Heathens do abhor.</P>
<P>For they will deny themselves nothing that may please their sensuall appetites, not wine in bowls nor forbidden flesh, nor any thing beside; while they feed without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, and drink without measure, and swear with∣out feeling, and live without God, daun∣cing a round about the mouth of Hell, into which they fall and perish everlastingly be∣fore they are aware, not considering how others have sped which have so done before them. As <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niahs</HI> feast ended in horror. So <HI>Belshazzars</HI> Banquet concluded with a Cup of wrath. So the <HI>Philistines</HI> mirth in their unavoydable ruin. And thus the peace∣able days of the wicked are described, who spend their lives in pleasure, and suddainly they are in Hell; all their whole mirth put together, being but as the merry madness
<PB N="500" REF="269"/>
of one hour; for they must assure them∣selves, that when their meal is ended, a great and heavy reckoning will follow.</P>
<P>Of all the Ages of men there is no time of life whereon we may ground more hope, and more fear than in Child-hood and youth. And therefore those Parents, who would have comfort in their Children, must look very carefully to their first seasoning; For as it was the Policy of the King of <HI>Ba∣bylon, Dan.</HI> 1. 4. to have the Children of the Jews, and not the old men to be taught the language of the Chaldeans: so it is the subtilty of the Divell, to have Children, while they are very young, traynd up in strange language, and to have them corrup∣ted with evill habits, which may make them, like a vessell, that hath ill liquor put into it at the first, tast of their first seasoning while life remaineth.</P>
<P>That dangerous time of youth, by the envy, and cunning, and help of Satan, car∣ries very many young men left too much unto themselves into most shameful courses, They being of themselves like a Ship on the maine Ocean, that hath neither Helm, nor compass, and therefore moves it knows not whither. Or in this, like weak limb'd Children, who, if they be suffered to go too
<PB N="501" REF="269"/>
much, and to soon, lame themselves for ever.</P>
<P>Yet many think that in that time of life, their youth gives them some liberty and priviledge, <HI>aliquid aetati juvenum est conce∣dendum,</HI> they say, which words abused, make them the Divels dispensation, and not Gods; though they may fondly and falsly suppose, that because they are young, they may be borne withall in any thing they do, as if Pride, Drunkenness, Whoredome, and the like most fearfull exorbitances, were not faults in youth, they not considering that want of years and want of judgement (which judgement enables to put a right difference 'twixt good and evill) usually go together. And that youth is like unto green wood, which is ever shrinking and warping; for <HI>as with the antient there is wisdom,</HI> Job. 12. 12. so pampered and ungoverned youth is com∣monly rash, heady, insolent, wedded to its own will, led by humour, a rebell to rea∣son, a subject to passion, fitter to execute than to advise: and because youth cannot consider, as it should, it is no marvell if it so often miscarry. The ways of youth being steep, and slippery, wherein it is very hard to stand, as very easy to fall, and to run into most fearful exorbitances: It being the usual
<PB N="502" REF="270"/>
manner of young men, so much to intend (as they falsly think) the love of themselves in the love of their pleasures, as that they cannot attend the love of God. And there∣fore that man may much better hope to come safely and happily unto the end of his course, who hath passed over his first jour∣ney (I mean his youth) well,</P>
<P>But (which is a very great hinderance unto many young men, when they do but begin to enter upon their way) there are many Parents which do not desire, that their Children should be good betimes, they be∣ing misled by one of the Devils Proverbs, which is <HI>a young Saint an old Devill.</HI> It is true, that some, who have been wild and wicked in youth, have proved good in age: But it is a most tryed truth, to encourage the groth of early holiness, which hath been made good by much experience, that <HI>a Saint in youth, an Angell in age.</HI></P>
<P>And truly very many Children may thank their Parents for much of the evill that is in them, beside their Birth-sin, poysoning them (as they do) by their evill examples. Children confidently believing that they may lawfully do any thing, they see their Parents do before them, hence <HI>Juvenal</HI> speaks well</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="503" REF="270"/>
<HEAD><Q><L>Maxima debetur pueris reverentia—</L></Q></HEAD>
<P>Therefore Parents should take heed what they do, or what they spe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k before their Children. As 'tis writ<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en of wise <HI>Cato</HI> (though an Heathen) that he was wont to carry himself with as much grav<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty before his Children, as if he had been before the Senate of <HI>Rome.</HI> The neglect of which care, shall give Children cause one day to speak that in truth unto their Parents, which <HI>Zipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rah</HI> sometimes sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke unadvisedly un∣to her husband <HI>Moses,</HI> when he had Cir∣cumcised her son, <HI>Ex 4. 25. Surely a bloody Husband art thou unto me:</HI> so these will say to their Parents that they have been bloody Fathers, and bloody Mothers unto them, in giving them a Serpent, when they should have given them a Fish, a stone when they should have given them bread; in teaching them to swear, when they should have taught them to pray, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oing them by their evill, when they might have done them much good, by their holy and unblameable examples, as also by their early instruction, and their timely correction, which might have prevented (through Gods blessing) their rushing into the pit of ruin.</P>
<P>But why Parents thus generally fail in
<PB N="504" REF="271"/>
their duties, we need not much marvell, if we consider the carelesness or rather inabi∣lity of most Parents to instruct their Chil∣dren</P>
<Q><L><HI>Scilicet expectas ut tradet mater honestes,</HI></L>

<Q><L>No Mother can good precepts give,</L>
<L>Who hath not learn'd her self to live.</L></Q>
<P>It is not to be hoped that Parents should give their Children better precepts than they have learn'd themselves.</P>
<P>But here I must prevent an objection, and 'tis this. That if Parents be not wanting in their duty herein, it is not al the care they can possibly have, which of it self can make good Children. For how many good Children have fall'n from bad Loins: And how many gracious Parents (to their greatest grief) have been the Fathers and Mothers of most untoward Children. The reason is, because goodness doth not like lands and goods de∣scend from Parents to Children, for God will be the free giver and bestower of all his Graces, <HI>and will have mercy, on whom he will have mercy.</HI> So then if our Children be good, we must thank God for that; if evill they may thank us and themselves, us for their
<PB N="505" REF="271"/>
birth-sin, and many times for more of their evill then so (as before:) themselves, for the improvement of that evill in the ways of wickedness.</P>
<P>However we may conclude this as a rule, that those Children of all others, (in all pro∣babilities) are like to prove best, who have been best seasoned in their young years; <HI>for train up a Child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it,</HI> Pr. 22. 6.</P>
<P>In the wars 'twixt <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> there was a little Maid of <HI>Israel</HI> taken by the <HI>Sy∣rians 2 Kings</HI> 5. and she was put to wait up∣on the wife of <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>Syrian.</HI> That <HI>Naaman</HI> was a great man with his Master the King of <HI>Syria,</HI> and honourable, saith the story, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but he was a Leaper, and that stain of Leprosie sauced all his greatness so much, that the poorest man in <HI>Syria</HI> would not have changed place with him, to have had his skin to boot. There is no greatness that can exempt a man from the most loath∣some and wearisome conditions: doubtless that Leprosie, must needs be a grievous bur∣den to that great Peer. The Maid of <HI>Israel</HI> tells her Mistriss, would God my Lord were with the Prophet which is in <HI>Samaria,</HI> for he would recover him of his Leprosie Her
<PB N="506" REF="272"/>
Mistriss presently tells her Lord, who upon this report immediately repayr unto that Prophet, and is healed of his disease. I re∣port that storie to this end, that it is very good for Parents to acquaint their Children while they be young with the knowledge of God and of his Prophets, for we do not know what great good they may do by it, The generall neglect of which, and of ma∣ny other duties of Parents, for the good and welfare of their Children, as the great faylings of others (I have named) in their severall relations, are principal, and most apparent causes of the distemper and sick∣ness of the whole Body of this Nation, even from the sole of the foot, unto the Crown of the head.</P>
<P>Never such liberty taken by youth of all sorts, of both sexes as now. How general∣ly do they forget God, the guide of youth, for how do they slig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him by that irreve∣rence they shew in religious duties, they being seduced in ways that carry them from Religion, and consequently▪ from God. What lightness, looseness, pride, drunken∣ness, and prophaneness may be observed in too too many of them. What a generall de∣bauchery expressed by wickedness in life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath eaten into the manners of such multi∣tudes
<PB N="507" REF="272"/>
of the younger sort of people, more by far in the present, than in foregoing times; whence it comes to pass, that there never was such a scarcity of good servants. So that if Almighty God (that can do what he will do) do not please to put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bs on them that may reform, or restrain them, the succeeding age is like to prove a monstrous genera∣tion.</P>
<P>How much uncharitableness and censo∣riousness, that is accompanied in some with blindness of mind, and consequently with error, about the things of God, hath taken up the thoughts of many more of riper years.</P>
<P>And lastly there is so much covetousness, which turns so many wholy into themselves, without respect had unto any others, which makes so many steer their course for wealth, esteeming any thing that may be gotten to be good gain, being resolved to be rich how∣ever they come by wealth, though that they get be like the waters of <HI>Bethelem 2 Sam.</HI> 23 17. Which <HI>David</HI> there calls blood, be∣cause gotten with so much hazard and jeo∣pardy of their lives that got those Waters: So of the lives and souls too of those that get this wealth; and yet for all this for <HI>Ju∣das</HI> his wages they will do <HI>Judas</HI> his work;
<PB N="508" REF="273"/>
they want peices of silver, &amp; must have them as <HI>Judas</HI> had, though they earn them as dear∣ly, and suffer for them as deeply as <HI>Judas</HI> did.

<P>The Prophet <HI>Esay</HI> once cryed, <HI>Es. 45. 8. O yee Heavens drop down Righteousness!</HI> when righteousness was taken up into the Clouds: So may we say, Oh! yee Heavens drop down kindness! Love, Charity in our times, that people may know that they were not borne onely for themselves, that they came not into the world to laugh, and joy, and rejoyce to themselves, nor to eat and drink, or to thrive and grow rich, and to live alone to themselves, and to their own private relations, but for others, who stand in need of them, who by the very Pre∣rogative of mankind, may challenge an in∣terest in their succour and service.</P>

<P>A man may think to sin without danger for a time, but never without fear. Oh this conscience, when it is throughly awakned, will appear to be a very strange, a terrible thing if, it be full of guilt, for then it will swell so big, as that it will be ready to break open the brest of him that bears it.</P>
<P>And it would do so, but for these Reasons, first, because it is many times hoodwink't, mask't, <HI>or seared, as with an hot iron,</HI> ha∣ving the mouth of it (as before) bung'd up, or hooft over, and this makes it not to see, or to be sensible of its present condition.</P>
<P>And 2. a man by the malice and cunning of Satan may be brought to esteem the doing of
<PB N="482" REF="275"/>
things good, which in themselves are most hor∣rid, &amp; damnable. Now conscience is to the soul, as it is represented to it, <HI>the time shall came that he which kills you shall think he doth God good service,</HI> and upon his false ground, a man may be never troubled at the acting of the worst things, they shall think they do God good service, but they do but think so, and shall first or last bemade to pay dear for so thinking &amp; so doing.</P>
<P>But however, this will be found a truth, that conscience is ever marked and ob∣served by her own eye, though no other eye perceive her; followed she is, and chased by her own foot, though nothing else pursue her; she flyes when no man followes; and and hath a thousand witnesses within her own brest, when she is free from all the world beside; she is a worm that ever gnaweth; a fire that ever burneth; and though a guilty man could es∣cape the hands of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verliving God, yet should he find it misery enough, and more than he could possibly beare, to he under the rack, or lash of a never dying conscience; the con∣sciences of the wicked being so filled with the guilt of sin, that there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom left for the peace and consolation of God to dwell in them. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain</HI> felt this weight like a <HI>Talent of</HI> head upon his soul, which he thought could never be removed, and therefore he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ers a blas∣ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>y against the grace of God never to be

But, <HI>Nemo polluto queat anim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mederi,</HI> No cure so difficult as the cleansing and healing of a polluted soul, <HI>no balme in Gilead, no Phisitian there can of himself help it,</HI> and as all the wealth of the world cannot buy off the guilt; so all the waters in the Sea cannot wash off the filth of one Sin.</P>

<P>Oh this fear, when it takes its rise from guilt, is a most terrible thing. It is written of <HI>Tiberi∣us</HI> the Emperour (a very politick and subtile, but a most prodigiously wicked man, who to compasse his ends the better, was <HI>summus si∣mulandi &amp; dissimulandi artifex;</HI> A very Ma∣ster-peece of dissimulation) that for a time he seemed to stand in awe of no power either in Heaven or earth, but after this monster had retired himself from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Capri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> for the more free enjoyment, of his most noysome

<PB N="467" REF="276"/>
in any parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulars laid down in my ma∣ny digressions, for my witnesses are in Hea∣ven and in my own bosome too, that I de∣sire to be angry and offended at nothing so much, as at that which angers, and displeaseth Almighty God, hating that which is evill in all, (and as far as I can know my own heart) am desirous to do it in my self first and most. But the sad consideration of the strange and still increasing wickednesses of this Nation (wherein we breath) bid me take leave to en∣large my self far in this case, <HI>and to rebuke sharply or cuttingly, to go to the very quick;</HI> I say the wickednesses of this Nation, to whom that of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> may be fitly ap∣plyed, <HI>that we are waxen fat, we shine over∣passing the deeds of the wicked,</HI> putting far from us the evill day while we laugh out the good, lying under the most heavy weight both of spirituall and other judgments, but feele them not, having been like <HI>Solomons foole,</HI> that could laugh when he was lashed, in ma∣ny things justifying <HI>Turks, Pagans, Heathen,</HI> in being <HI>corrupted more than they all.</HI> Our sins being like that <HI>tree which Nebu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hadnezzar saw in his vision, whose top reached up to Heaven,</HI> and hath spread it self in its branches over all the parts of the earth here below.</P>

<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="19 pages" DISP="〈19 pages missing〉"/>
<P><PB N="486" REF="277"/>
for notwithstanding all these sad and horrible truths I have named, I must say this, that if God have a people, a Church in any place <HI>under Heaven,</HI> (which none but an <HI>Atheist</HI> or a <HI>Divell</HI> will make doubt of) they may be found in this Nation, and in that we may take comfort, for they are the <HI>righteous that deliver the Island, the remnant that keepe it from desolation,</HI> and were it not for those few, whom the very great multitudes, amongst whom they are mingled, scorn and hate, this Nation could not continue, which should make the wicked of this land, if not out of piety, yet (if they understood themselves) out of policy to love and respect those for whose sake they fare so much the better.</P>
<P>God hath had a Church long planted in this Nation, and I dare say that since the Gospell hath been published to the world, it was ne∣ver preached with more Power than it hath been here in these later times; As for our Fore-fathers, they instead of the food of life, issuing from the two breasts of the Church, the Law and the Gospels, were made to feed on moudly &amp; fennowed Traditions. The book of God was sealed up from them, in an unknown tongue, which they could neither understand nor read, but for us at this present day, our Tem∣ples are open, we may come, our Bibles are eng∣shed, we may read, our Pulpits frequented we may heare, &amp; from these considerations ariseth a
<PB N="487" REF="277" MS="y"/>
great cause both of wonder &amp; greife (unto every one who loves the glory of God, the happi∣ness of his countrey, and the good of himself and Relations) to consider that here, where there is so much light and truth, light to guide, and truth to settle men in the way of life and Salvation, there should be so much wavering, wandering, and wickedness.</P>
<P><HI>For aske among the Heathens who hath done such things? the Virgin Israel hath done very fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hily,</HI> or an horrible thing, as if the Prophet had said in other language, Strumpets, Harlots, Prostitutes, (who sell, their Souls with their Bodies) had done but their kind, but for <HI>Israel,</HI> whom I have esteemed as a <HI>Vir∣gin,</HI> for England which I have owned above all the Nations of the earth to do such and such things, who would have thought it? Nay, further (as before) considering all the means, that we of this Nation have had, above all the Nations in the world beside to teach us to <HI>know God,</HI> and the great variety of mercies we have enjoyed, to provoke us to <HI>love God</HI> (that have had the <HI>wind</HI> and <HI>Sun</HI> of all other people) the <HI>Sun shines</HI> not upon a Nation (if we be considered collectively, and together) worse than we are.</P>

Nation considered (as before) are a people that justifie <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> oh what proficients have we been in the <HI>School</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> when as those sins, which <HI>the Apostle would not have so much as named among Christians,</HI> have been so <HI>common amongst us,</HI> so that we may boldly say how that <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and those other Cities, which Almighty God <HI>overthrew in anger, and repented not;</HI> those Cities <HI>which suffer the just and eternall vengeance of Almighty God,</HI> lie not in Ashes for greater sins than have been committed amongst us.</P>
<P>But I can take no pleasure to be long raking in filthiness, and corruption, I will therefore make hast to give over this unpleasing, unsa∣voury and nauseating discourse; The rather, because I know, that neither counselling nor declaming against the sins of the present times doth much good. This I believe that if I were <HI>filled with a spirit of false-hood and could prophesie of wine and strong drink,</HI> my book would want no buyers to read, and like it: but I shall leave that dis∣course unto those that have not heard <HI>of Death in the Pot;</HI> for my part I shall desire to be in∣rolled in the number of those, who can <HI>wish with the Prophet Jeremy, that their heads were waters, and their eyes fountains of teares, &amp;c. and that they had in the wilderness a lodging place,</HI> that they might <HI>set down and weep day
<PB N="463" REF="278" MS="y"/>
and night</HI> for the sins of the Nation and pla∣ces where they live; that they might sit down, and weep, and weepe, over and over again those sins, <HI>figh and cry</HI> for the Abominations they must needs take <HI>notice of,</HI> by which retire∣ment they might be freed from seeing and hearing, and from vexing their Souls, <HI>from day to day</HI> at the <HI>unlawfull deeds, and filthy con∣versation of others</HI> and have better leisure to think themselves out of this wicked world.</P>
<P>Oh what cause have we of this Nation to beleeve that judgment is near, when the Lord hath tryed us every way, and all hath done us <HI>no good.</HI> As f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst God hath been exceeding good unto us in many favours, so that it might have been said of <HI>England</HI> (as one speaks of <HI>Israel)</HI> that the Lord made that people a president of his love and favour, that all the Nations of the world might learn by them, from their example what God could do, and what he would do for a people whom he loved, but we have not been bettered by these benefits, and doubtless if many amongst us had not been so blinded with light, and sick of being well, the body of this Church and state had never received such wounds as seeme incurable. Oh if we had not sinn'd away our mercies; God would never have taken away any of his <HI>loving kindnesses from us:</HI> but our of∣fences have been marvellously increased by our
<PB N="490" REF="279"/>
obligations, there being no sins of so deep a die as thosewhich are committed against mercy.</P>
<P>The Lord hath tryed us otherwise, <HI>his judgments have been in the land,</HI> and the <HI>keenest</HI> of all <HI>temporall</HI> judgments, the <HI>sword,</HI> and the <HI>sharpest</HI> of all <HI>swords,</HI> that which peirceth deepest▪ because, drawn amongst our <HI>own selves,</HI> which hath made us <HI>our own spoy∣lers, &amp; our own prey, yet we the inhabitants here∣of have not learn'd Righteousness,</HI> we have been encouraged by peace, and we have slighted that, and we have felt the <HI>sword of war,</HI> and that hath done us no good.
<Q><L>—Saevior armis</L>
<L>Libertas nocuis.</L></Q></P>
<P>Liberty as it hath been abused, having gi∣ven us deeper &amp; more dangerous wounds, than ever the sword could. So that neither the Ma∣jestie of God, nor the Mercy of God, the Goodness of God, nor the greatness of God, the favour of God, nor the frown of Almigh∣ty God hath wrought upon us to reform us.</P>
<P>Now all these particulars put together, they may give us great cause to feare, what we shall be made to feel, the weight of many sad con∣clusions, which for the present we will not re∣gard; as that sin committed and unrepented of, ever leaves a venome and a sting behind it; and therefore, that to sin, is not the way to pros∣per, that the longer a reckoning runs one, the
<PB REF="279" MS="y"/>
greater still the Summe; and that the further compass a blow fetcheth about, the heavier still it lights.</P>
<P>I shall speak it again, under how many sad discouragements have many able sober minded, and orthodox Ministers of the Gospel laboured in these later times, who as if they had not enemies enough abroad, find them at home in their own house, their own coat, <HI>proprijs pennis configimur,</HI> wounded we are by our own quills, by some who are ex∣cellent at close bites, and though they speak us fair, can open their mouths as wide against us as any others, and then when we deserve nothing but well. As the <HI>Athenians</HI> by their <HI>Ostracisme</HI> would punish desert, and Crown ignorance. But vessels that are most hollow and empty make the greatest sound and noyse. And as <HI>love thinketh no evill:</HI> So envy can speak no good; we need not wonder at this, when we consider that men of the highest deservings have many times had the worst usage.</P>
<P>And then if we find such dealing from a∣mongst our selves, we need not marvel at any thing we suffer from others, from any, from all that do not think well of us, that do not love us, and for that reason which <HI>Martiall</HI> expresseth in this <HI>Epigram.</HI></P>

<P>When the Cynick was asked what beast did bite soarest and worst, he answered of tame beasts a flatterer, and of wild beasts a <HI>Slan∣derer:</HI> many a good man sometimes feeles the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeth of both these, of the tame beasts, who when they creep into their bosomes will spit in their faces; of the wild beasts by their de∣tractions, slanders, censures, prejudices, contra∣dictions, and what not, who make their tongues worse than the tongues of doggs, for they are medicinable; they cure, they heal, but the tongues of these are sharpe, they wound, they kill.</P>
<P>But in regard that it is the nature of these beast thus to do, a wise and a good man, who deserves well, yet heares ill, hath no more cause to be troubled at it, than the bright and full Moon going on her course hath at the barking of many doggs.</P>
<P>And as some speak evill of us because we do not <HI>run with them to the same excess of riot,</HI> to distemper, and overthrow our bodies: so others will not abide us, because we cannot come up to them in a like luxuriency and rank∣ness
<PB REF="280" MS="y"/>
of opinions▪ to disturb our brains, and to destroy our souls.</P>
<P>Now further, how have the Ministers of the Gospel in these last times (wherein the world grows worse and worse) been discou∣raged in the neglect that many find <HI>for the paines</HI> taken in their great work, their own proper means and maintenance withheld from them by the fraud and deceit of some, and forceably taken away by the power and vio∣lence of others, and grudgingly paid them by many more, as if that greatest of all works, the work of the ministry, deserved no wages:</P>
<P>And lastly (which is more and worse) what grevious heart-breakings do the faithfull Mi∣nisters of the Gospell meet withall in their paines, a very great abundance of that spiri∣tuall seed of the word they sow so continually miscarrying, upon the thorny, hard, rockey▪ barren hearts of their hearers.</P>
<P>It was an excellent commendation that <HI>Quintilian</HI> gave of <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperour that he was <HI>Patientissimus veri,</HI> most pati∣ent to heare and to entertain truths, how hap∣pie should we be if our hearers in general de∣served the like praise.

<P>Some, that live in great and grosse sinns, cannot endure to have those their sinns ripp'd up or laid open; dealing with us herein as a mad-man doth with a Chyrur∣gia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, flying in his face when he goes about to open a Vein that might recover him out of his Madness.

<P>When our Blessed Saviour fed the people, they resolved presently to make him a King, <HI>John</HI> 6. but after when, he rebuked their vile manners, they cryed <HI>Crucifie him, Crucifie him, let him be crucified</HI> John 19.</P>
<P>I have formerly heard from many of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation (and I do believe the Re∣port is very true <HI>(that if a man did preach against their Bishops, while they were ha∣ling them down, they would hear him with a great deal of seeming attention, it did so please their humour; but if the same man told the people afterward of their Swearing, Drunken∣ness, Whoring or the like, they would cry</HI> Wha, wha, what doth the man ail? what would the man have?

<P>Thus the <HI>Priest of Bethel,</HI> though he could not abide that <HI>Amos</HI> in his prophesie should grate upon the <HI>house of Israel,</HI> yet if he would fly into the land of <HI>Judah,</HI> and prophesie there, he was not against that. And though that the <HI>Jewes</HI> could not endure that <HI>Jeremy</HI> should meddle, with the burden of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> yet if he would prophesie against <HI>Edom,</HI> and <HI>Moab,</HI> and <HI>Ammon,</HI> he might for all them. Mens dainty eares cannot endure to have their own sins touch'd, because truth like light is of a discerning nature, and makes things manifest. <HI>Hence evill men love darkness more than light, because their works are evill,</HI> As dark-shops are best for bad wares. Light is good, but to bad eyes offensive; Honey is sweet, but to wounds smarting; So truth is wholesome, but to guilty men distastfull, like the bloody waters in <HI>Egypt</HI> sweet and potable to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> (as <HI>Josephus</HI> reports) but so unsavoury to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> as that they would not down.</P>
<P>As they write of some creatures that they have <HI>gallu</HI> in their eare, <HI>fell in aure:</HI> so the hearing of some truths distasts many. <HI>like wa∣ters of wormwood,</HI> which may make a new proverb <HI>bitter as truth,</HI> for this many times puts some men into the <HI>Gal of bitterness,</HI> an∣gers,
<PB N="526" REF="282"/>
nettles them, as ulcerous men use to shrink at the lightest touch, yea sometimes to cry out at the very suspition of touching. So that we are often driven unto this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> if we desire to please we must not speak truth, for if we tell truth, we cannot please.</P>
<P>Tell a Politician this truth, that, <HI>Summara∣tio est quae pro Religione facit,</HI> that that's the best, the strongest reason, which makes most for Religion, and that the best policie which makes most for Piety, this truth crosseth his purposes, projects, designes, and therefore he cannot abide it.</P>
<P>Acquaint a covetous man with that truth spoken by St. <HI>Paul, that the love of money is the root of all evil</HI> (because every sin either direct∣ly or consequently springs from Covetousness) you offer him losse, you are a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>respasser to his trade, an Enemy.</P>
<P>And let that truth spoken by St. <HI>Peter</HI> be pressed upon a filthy voluptuous person, that fleshly lusts war against the soul; he regards you not, but though he perish in his lust, he will enjoy the pleasures that are present.</P>
<P>Thus other sinners either question or quar∣rell at the truths that are told them: Censure and Hatred being the ancient lot of truth, Censure of the message, and Hatred to the bearer.</P>
<P>When <HI>Lot</HI> came unto his <HI>Sons in Law</HI> then liveing in <HI>Sodome,</HI> and acquainted them with

Gods purpose immediately to burn that, and other adjacents Cities, though he warned them as a prophet, and admonished them as a father, that if they loved their lives they must presently quit that place, they would not harken unto him, but as <HI>Livie</HI> observes of others (though in another case) <HI>nec morbum ferre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossunt, nec remedium,</HI> that they were troubled both at their sickness and cure, so these sons in lawof <HI>Lot,</HI> might happily be a little startled, at the report that <HI>Sodome</HI> should be destroyed; but more troubled at the thought of leaving <HI>Sodome, which was as the Garden of the Lord, before it was destroyed,</HI> and that special love they did beare to that place might share up their infidelity to question the truth of that threat, and to reason the case hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ily thus. Who ever yet knew it to rain fire? and whence should that Brimstone come? and if it must rain fire and Brimstone, why rather upon <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> than upon other places? and therefore they were very willing to believe that their father in that <HI>menace mocked them,</HI> in telling them a fable or fancy of his own head, upon which they resolve to put it to an adventure, rather to stay and burn in <HI>Sodome,</HI> than to live and be safe and happie out of it.

<P>St. <HI>John</HI> tells us in his third Epistle and fourth chap. <HI>that he could have no greater joy than to hear that those which he had taught did walk in the truth,</HI> that is, did live in some mea∣sure
<PB N="529" REF="283"/>
as they were taught; which indeed is the joy and rejoycing the crown of every <HI>faithfull Minister of the Gospel.</HI> On the other side there can be no greater griefe, unto those who watch over mens souls to keep them safe, and above all things desire by the ministery of the word, <HI>to bring them from darkness to light fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the Power of Satan unto God,</HI> pressing upon them all arguments they can possibly invent which may p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rswade them to suffer God through <HI>Je∣sus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ist</HI> to save their souls, and when this is done, to find all their l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bour lost, all their strength and indeavour to be spent in vaine. The spiritual sword of the word having had its edg and point broken off, and battered upon the stony hearts of their hearers, which it could not pierce. Oh this is an argument of discourse and discouragement above all other argu∣ments that can be thought on, unto those who know how to value a precious soul, and to desire its salvation.</P>
<P>And truly (which before was pointed at) if parents do not assist us in the ordering of their children, and Masters of servants in the reforming of their families: and to these if Magistrates suffer their swords to rust in their scabbards, rather than to draw them out in our assistance that they may reach scandalous offen∣ders, whom the sword of the word cannot peirce, we may preach <HI>till our Tongues cleave
<PB N="530" REF="284"/>
to our gums, or fasten to the roofes of our mouths,</HI> and all to little purpose. And I must further add, that if all I named before do their parts, the voyce of the Minister will be too weak, the sword of the Magi∣strate too short for to reach and bring down rebellious sinners unto the obedience of Christ, <HI>unless the mightie arme of the Lord</HI> be revealed in his ordinances: yet however b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause the ministry of the word is the ordinary means which Almightie God hath appointed and sancti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed, to con∣vert s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uls unto him, (not excluding other mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that tend to this end) there might be a very great hope of doing God much service this way by this present generati∣on, if Magistrates and Ministers and others in their several places did endeavour with all their might, to preach down sin, and to smite down sin, and to pray down sin, and to live down sin.</P>
<P>But sad experience shews that it is far otherwise. And it is a most evident signe that the destruction is neer when the <HI>mes∣sages from God,</HI> and the <HI>Messengers of God</HI> are, as in these daies so generally neglected; when the faithfull Dispencers of Gods Or∣dinances, who are <HI>spirituall Phisitians,</HI> have improved all their skill, to cure mens

he shook his Raiment against them saying, <HI>Your blood be upon your own heads,</HI> as if he had said, I found you the Children of Death, and so I leave you, grow in your filthiness and unrighteousnes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you have fullfilled the measure of your Fore-fathers, for my own part I wash my hands in innocency, I can free my Soul in the sight of God, I was carefull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o apply my Cures unto the hurts of <HI>Corinth,</HI> but they would not be healed.</P>
<P>Which thing, if the Lord in just judge∣ment ever suffer to betall this Land, as there are not very many moneths passed since there was a great and strong endea∣vour by some (who fetched their Counsells from the depths of Hell) to remove both <HI>Candlesticks</HI> and <HI>Candles</HI> cut of it, that so the people of this Nation might <HI>have re∣turned again to Aegypt</HI> and in time become Bruits, Atheists, and worse than Heathens.

Providence prevented it. I say if any such thing ever happen to this Land, they who shall be so unhappy as to live to the fight of that wofull day, may borrow those words which that poor distressed woman somtimes uttered in the extream bitterness of her soul, saying 1 <HI>Sam. 4. 22.

<P>But blessed be God, Prophets are yet in <HI>England,</HI> and long may they continue in it, the Pearl is yet to be found in our field, the Gospell is yet amongst us. Oh that as we have the sound thereof daily in our eares, the letter of it walking through our lipps, so we might see the power thereof more manifested in our lives.</P>
<P>To speak a few words more of those <HI>In∣dians</HI> with reflection still upon our selves, let us consider that as the Ground is more or less manured, so tis expected it should
<PB N="535" REF="286"/>
bring forth fruit accordingly <HI>some an hun∣dred, and some fifty and some thirty fold, some more some less, but all some.

An Hebrew must live as an Hebrew, not as an Aegyptian. A Prophet as a Pro∣phet, and not (by drudging and digging) as an Husbandman. A Believer must live as a Believer, and not as an Heathen or Infi∣del. A Professor of the Gospell must walke as a Professor of the Gospel, not as a Li∣bertine, an Epicure or Athiest. For a Wil∣derness to be barren there is no wonder at all in that, but if those Trees which have been well husbanded, dung'd and dress'd, continue still fruitless, they deserve cursing. <HI>Arbori infructuosae debentur duo, secur is et ignis.

<P>When I have seriously thought on the many and mighty Nations at this day in∣habiting the remote parts of the Earth, and how that many of them are people that
<PB N="536" REF="287"/>
live in happy and most fruitfull Soils, which afford every thing to please, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, and to enrich the Sons of Men in sweet Aires; that being most true of the Psalmist, <HI>The earth hath God given to the Children of men, Psal.</HI> 115. 16. To the Children of men who are meer Aliens and Strangers to God. Many of these enjoying as delectable places as the Sun shines on. And for the people themselves, many of them, for flesh and bloud, as comely as the Earth bears. And further, many of them people which are provident to forecast, ingenuous to in∣vent and most able and active to perform. Concerning whom, they who have tryed them may further say, <HI>surely they are a wise people a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of great understanding;</HI> but considering again, that they <HI>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oying every thing, want every thing</HI> in <HI>wanting Christ,</HI> it makes their condition in all their enjoyments, which seeme to make them happy, most miserable.</P>
<P>To which purpose <HI>Lactantius</HI> speaks well of the Learning of Heathen Philosophers, <HI>Omnis Doctrina Philosophorum sine capite &amp;c.</HI> That all their learning was without an head, because they knew not God, and therefore seeing they were blind, and hear∣ing
<PB N="537" REF="287"/>
they were deaf, and understanding they understood nothing as they ought to have done it. So for outvvard things, though they have abundance, yet they have nothing, because they have not God, in the right knowledge and understanding of him, as he ought to be known in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>They want Christ because they are alto∣gether unacquainted with him; but if vve, who have had such a continuall povver of him, and have such advantages to knovv him by hearing him so often teach in our streets, if vve vvant him, for vvant of closing vvith him, and consequently be never a vvhit the better for him, it will make our estate by far, to be more lamentable than theirs. <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sydo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> and <HI>Sodome,</HI> and all the people I have named, will speed bet∣ter at the day of judgement than we shall do.</P>
<P>These Heathens in <HI>East-India</HI> (as I strong∣ly believe) see as far with the eye of Nature as it can possibly reach, and nature it self teacheth them, and teacheth all the world beside, that there is a God, but who this God is, and how this God is to be worship∣ped, must elsewhere be learn'd. Thus nature without Grace being like <HI>Sampson</HI> when his eyes were out, who could not readily find
<PB N="538" REF="288"/>
the Pillars of the house wherein he was, no more can any man of himself fasten unto any pillar of prop of truth, unless the Spi∣rit of God instruct and direct him how to do it.</P>
<P><HI>Veritatem Philosophia quaerit, Theologi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> invenit, Religio possidet,</HI> saith <HI>Mirandula.</HI> Phi∣losophy seeks truth, Divinity finds it, but Religion possesseth it not the face or mask, or visard, or forme, but the truth and pow∣er of Religion, of which something by the way.</P>
<P>The truth, and power of Religion, I say, for there have been ever many misconcei∣vings about Religion. How many stirs, and quarrels, and Heats have we known about the list, and fringe of Christs Garment, (as one of most high deserving long since obser∣ved) and these mistakes in Religion have made many to agree no better than the Bricklayers of <HI>Babel,</HI> who when their tongues were divided could not understand one anothers speech, but did mistake one thing for another; And thus do many now who take nature (if but a little refined) for Grace; Will for Conscience. So a floa∣ting knowledge for true wisdom, cruelty for Justice, covetousness for frugality, base∣ness for humility, presumption for hope, a
<PB N="539" REF="288"/>
distempered heat for true zeal, and vaine cre∣dulity for faith. And the reason of all this is, because the best Graces have their Coun∣terfeits, and from hence come those many mistakes.</P>
<P>Now for the power and truth of Religion we shall the better know it, if we first briefly discover what it is not, and then what it is. What it is not; It doth not consist in a bare hearing of the word, though heard never so frequently, nor in a bare performance of o∣ther duties, which are good in themselves, though praiers perform'd ne'r so constantly; long prayers wil not excuse the devouring of vvidovvs houses, nor the doing of other good duties, any the like acts of oppression and violence. Thou Preachest, thou hearest, thou readest, thou prayest, but how livest thou? what doest thou? if these questions cannot be well resolved, all good perfor∣mances will prove nothing worth.</P>
<P>Again, the power and truth of Religion is not manifested in a rash censuring and condemning of others, I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican (you know who said it.) It doth not consist in the ex∣alting of a mans self above others, whatso∣ever his gifts and graces are. It is not to be found meerly in an ability to talk or
<PB N="540" REF="289"/>
prattle, or dispute, or wrangle, and after to hold the conclusion, whatsoever may be said against it in the premises.</P>
<P>But for the truth and power of Religion, if we would briefly, and in some particulars know what it is, it is that which makes a man labour first to know, and then to be∣lieve, and to do whatsoever is to be bele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved and to be done, but to believe and do rather than to know. It is that which makes a man put a better esteem upon others than upon himself. It is that which puts a guard on the lips, a bridle on the tongue, a cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b on the will, and gives Rules to the affections; vvhich, vvhen they are high and exalted, keep the heart still lovv, Because the more acquaintance the heart hath vvith God, the more humble it is, even behol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing through Gods purity its ovvn vileness. And there∣fore a man (in vvhom the truth and povver of Religion shines) vvhen he hears of sinners, borrovvs the Apostles language, and saith of himself, that I am the chief, for he kee∣ping a continuall guard and vvatch over him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf, can accuse himself of thousand, both faylings and sins, vvhen he is free from all the vvorld beside. This further makes a man to behold indifferent things vvith obedience, rather than vvith opposition or dispute,
<PB N="541" REF="289"/>
knovving that the vvisdom vvhich is from above, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first <HI>pure</HI> and then <HI>peaceable.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly therefore, when the truth and power of Religion is separated from the profession thereof, a mans Religion is no∣thing worth for in this Case there is small difference 'twixt an Israelite and an <HI>Ishmae∣lite,</HI> 'twixt a Circumcised Hebrew, and an uncircumcised Philistine, 'twixt a Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ized Englishman, and an unwashen Turk F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the barren Figtree in Gods Orchard is in no better case, than the bramble in the wilder∣ness, for God will lap them both up in the same bundle of condemnation, It being all one to deny the faith, and not soundly and sincerely to profess it.</P>
<P>It is reason which makes us men, it is Re∣ligion that makes us Christians, woe be to us that we were borne men if, we be not Christians, woe be to us that we are called Christians, if our lives shame our Christiani∣ty, if we be not Christians in deed, and in earnest, as well in name, and in profession so.</P>
<P>We quarrell at the superstition and blind devotion of others. But let us examine our selves, whether superstition in them, hath not a great deal of more heat in it, than Re∣ligion in us; whether in their blind devo∣tion,
<PB N="443" REF="290"/>
the avvfulness in their se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vices of God, doth not arraign and condemn irreverence in ours.</P>
<P>Ready we are to judge the Papists for their rash vows of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>y, but let not us that do so, ever hope tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cleaneness will bring us to Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>n. And we that are for∣ward to condemn the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts for their mad conceivings about works of Supererrogation, must never think that Faith without works, will justifie us before God. That we, who wonder at such people as I have named in East India, as at others for their austeritie of life, which they voluntarily and uncon∣strainedly submit unto in their will-wor∣ships, must never conceive that doing vvhat vve please, what vve vvill, can bring us at last to true happiness. God hath called us (saith the Apostle) to glory and vertue, to vertue and holiness as the means, to glory and happiness as the end. That thereforeof St. <HI>Hierom</HI> is undoubtedly true, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifficile imò impossibile est &amp; quis transeat à deliciis ad delicias,</HI> &amp;c. That it is an hard, yea, an im∣possible thing, for a man to leap from plea∣sure to Paradice, here to have his belly fill'd continually with the delicacies of the Crea∣tures, there to have his mind satisfied vvith the fulness of joy, and in both vvorlds to appear glorious.</P>
<P><PB N="554" REF="290" MS="y"/>
Stories are fill'd with rare examples of virtue even in Heathens, <HI>Seneca</HI> the Philo∣sopher Writes of <HI>Sixtius,</HI> that vvhen the day was ended, and the night vvas come, vvhere∣in he should take his rest, he vvould first ask his mind <HI>quoa malum sanasti hodie</HI> &amp;c? vvhat evill hast thou healed this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay? vvhat vice hast thou withstood? and in what part art thou bettered? I find this recorded of another, who was so exact in his walking, that his whole life was <HI>perpetua censura,</HI> &amp;c. a continuall censure of himself. <HI>Ari∣stides</HI> for his uprightness was called the just. And <HI>Tully</HI> Writes of <HI>Fabricius</HI> that he was a man who would resolve well, and after so unmoveably bent to perform what he had resolved to do, <HI>ut facilius solem è suo cursu,</HI> &amp;c. that you might as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon put the Sun out of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> course, as <HI>Fabricius</HI> from his intended purpose: I have ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erved before, that ve∣ry many people in East India, what lets and impediments soever they have, will by no means omit their frequent devotions, nor any other thing they esteem themselves bound to perform, as to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he far grea∣ter shame for Christians; when every tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e is sufficient to make such a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion as may hinder them in Religious dut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</P>
<P>And for many of those Heathens I have
<PB N="544" REF="291"/>
spoken of, they live up even to the very height of nature, and want means to lead them further. Now what shall I say more of them? surely thus, that our Blessed Sa∣viour lik'd and loved the young man in the Gospel, <HI>Mar.</HI> 10. 21. even for that mora∣litie he saw in him, <HI>Jesus beholding him, lo∣ved him.</HI> And so may Almighty God who is infinite in mercy look in favour upon ma∣ny of these poor Creatures, that go as far as they can, in shewing them Jesus Christ, and in his face beholding them; <HI>for many shall come from the East and West, and North, and South and shall sit down with</HI> Abraham <HI>and</HI> Isaac <HI>and</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acob <HI>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But this is a consideration lockt up a∣mongst Gods secrets, and therefore I dare not pry any more or further into it; neither shall I for the present enlarge my self in this <HI>Miscellany;</HI> which I could have made to swell into a Volume. But if that I have writ∣ten be as well taken as it is well meant, it is enough if not too much.</P>
<P>However there are two things which I must adde in relation to my self. The first (that I may not alwaies lye at the mercy of my Reader) this though, <HI>difficile est Satyram non scribere,</HI> that if my Pen hath let fall any thing in this discourse unbeseeming my cal∣ling
<PB N="545" REF="291"/>
and years, I most humbly beg pardon for that; I shall leave the Press to make an ansvver for it self.</P>
<P>For the Second, I shall presume one par∣don, and that is for the leaneness and lowness of my stile, vvherevvith this Relation is cloathed, when my Reader considers, that I lived amongst Indians vvhich made me rude.</P>

<L>THis Lif's our way, in which where ere we be</L>
<L>We miss our path, if that felicitie</L>
<L>Be not our utmost aym; towards which we meet</L>
<L>With Cross-ways, Rubs and streights that cause our feet</L>
<L>To stumble or to faint: yet must we on,</L>
<L>What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'re we meet, untill our journeys done.</L>
<L>We seek a Country, cannot find it here,</L>
<L>Here in this Pilgrimage, i'th whole world, where</L>
<L>The streightest, smoothest paths, which most do please,</L>
<L>Are clog'd with toyl and trouble; but want ease.</L>
<L>Our God, and Country too are both above,</L>
<L>We keep our way whiles that we thither move,</L>
<L>But loose it when our motion doth not tend</L>
<L>To that hop'd period, which may make our end</L>
<L>Happy and safe. There is no standing still</L>
<L>Here in this life; we do extreamly ill,</L>
<L>When we proceed not, for if once we slack</L>
<L>To press towards the mark, we then draw back.</L>
<L>Who therefore sees beyond his eyes, must know</L>
<L>He hath a further journey still to go:</L>
<L>For though he could with weary paces get</L>
<L>The world's great round, his tyresome progress yet</L>
<L><PB REF="292" MS="y"/>
Were not all pass'd, still must he think his ear</L>
<L>Fill'd with that voice <HI>Elias</HI> oft did hear,</L>
<L>What doest thou here <HI>Elias?</HI> up be gone,</L>
<L>Andafter many days still cry'd go onne.</L>
<L>Who follows close Gods call, and way runs best,</L>
<L>Till he receives his penny, take his rest.</L>
<L><HI>In three parts of the vvorld I've been, novv come.</HI></L>
<L><HI>To my last journey, that vvill bring me home.</HI></L>
