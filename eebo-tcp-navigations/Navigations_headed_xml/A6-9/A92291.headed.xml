<HEAD>REASONS <HI>Proposed for the</HI> Encourage∣ment <HI>of all People to under-write to the</HI> New Subscriptions, <HI>appointed to be made to the late</HI> East-India <HI>Companyes Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <HI>BEcause</HI> the said Company have been a long time a Corporation, for the <HI>Honour and Profit</HI> of the Nation.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Because</HI> they have <HI>a great Estate, clear of all Debts and Incumbrances</HI> at Home and Abroad, intrinsically worth more than 150 <HI>l. per cent.</HI> which is above 1100000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Because all their Charters,</HI> as well their Old ones, as those two lately obtained, are to be confirmed by <HI>Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Because</HI> their <HI>Stock</HI> will <HI>Rise considerably</HI> so soon as these <HI>Subscrip∣tions</HI> are compleated, or any <HI>Ships Arrive,</HI> although it be not worth <HI>much,</HI> and that the Company should not be confirmed by <HI>Act of Parli∣ament;</HI> and then one may easily sell out again to <HI>Profit.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>1. <HI>Because</HI> the said <HI>Company</HI> have been a long time a <HI>Corporation, to the Honour and Profit of this Nation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But as all <HI>Generals</HI> are made up of <HI>Particulars,</HI> so it may not be amiss to give <HI>some particular Instances</HI> to shew how they have been a long time <HI>a Corporation to the Honour and Profit of this Nation,</HI> which appears very plain by what follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> that they obtained the grant of <HI>the sole Trade of the</HI> East-Indies <HI>exclusive</HI> of all others, and exer∣cised the same, though the <HI>Subjects of</HI> England, could not, nor can be excluded from it but by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> as may appear by <HI>the Kings Message</HI> sent to the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> in <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1692. and likewise by the Opinion of the <HI>Judges,</HI> which has been given in this Matter.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they have obtained <HI>the power of Seizing the Ships and Goods</HI> of their Fellow-Subjects, for Trading into the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and have actually put the same Power in <HI>Erecution,</HI> contrary to <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they have procured <HI>Ships outward-bound to be Arrested and Stopped in</HI> England, upon
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>pretence of <HI>their having notice,</HI> that they were Bound to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> though <HI>no Law</HI> hinders them from going thither.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they have Obtained and Executed <HI>the Power of Seizing, Imprisoning, and Fini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g</HI> the Persons of their Fellow-Subjects for Trading into the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> which <HI>no Law Prohibits,</HI> or <HI>makes Criminal;</HI> and it must not be denied, but that 'tis <HI>a Great Honour and Profit to any Nation,</HI> where a few Subjects have arrived to the Exercise of <HI>such Powers,</HI> which some of <HI>the Greatest Potentates in the World</HI> cannot pretend to.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they Com∣menced, and Prosecuted several <HI>Suits at Law,</HI> in Actions of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> — and 200000 <HI>l.</HI> — each; against divers of their <HI>Fellow-Subjects,</HI> for Trading to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> which by Law they might do; and thereby have put them to <HI>Great and Vexatious Oppressions,</HI> without any other Remedy than <HI>Patience,</HI> the common Comfort of all Misfortunes.</P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they Pro∣cured <HI>a Commission</HI> to Execute <HI>Martial Law;</HI> and have Executed the same on <HI>the Lives</HI> of their Fellow-Subjects, <HI>contrary to Law.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>for the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> That they Caused the Subjects of <HI>England <HI>to be Hanged;</HI></HI> when on their Tryals they were only found Guilty of a <HI>Riot:</HI> — Which is a greater Power than <HI>the King himself</HI> has; who can cause no man to be <HI>Hanged,</HI> but <HI>by due Course of Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They have <HI>Paid such vast Summs of Money for Customs,</HI> although the <HI>Duties</HI> on all <HI>East India</HI> Goods are now so <HI>extremely Low:</HI> For they have Paid in Two whole Years of their Trade, <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds;</HI> which upon the Trade they formerly used to drive, or might now be driven, would have amounted to more than <HI>Ten Times</HI> that Summ.</P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They have in a manner given this whole Trade to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who now supply all the World (<HI>England</HI> not excepted) with most sorts of <HI>East-India</HI> Commodities.</P>
<P>But however they are Commended, <HI>as Honourable, and Pro∣fitable to the Nation;</HI> yet some of their Actions have been No∣toriously and Scandalously <HI>Fraudulent</HI> and <HI>Immoral,</HI> as well as <HI>Cruel</HI> and <HI>Bloody.</HI> For the <HI>Hanging</HI> those Persons was Voted <HI>Murther</HI> by <HI>the Honourable House of Commons,</HI> and the obtaining a Grant to Execute <HI>Martial Law,</HI> and Signing Instructions to put the same <HI>in Execution, <HI>were adjudged Crimes;</HI></HI> for which some Men might justly be Excepted out of the <HI>Act of Indemnity.</HI></P>
<P>These are some few of <HI>their Proceedings</HI> toward their Fellow-Subjects, but it would require a very large Volume to give an Account of the rest of them.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="2"/>
<P>And Their Actions abroad, towards the <HI>Natives of</HI> India, have been no less to the <HI>Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> than what they have done to their Fellow Subjects <HI>at home.</HI></P>
<P>For, <HI>to the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> After <HI>their Factors</HI> had run in Debt Three or Four Hundred Thousand Pounds at <HI>Surat, their President</HI> got away from thence <HI>without Paying it;</HI> and the greatest part thereof remains <HI>Ʋnpaid even to this day;</HI> besides the Restitution which they are to make.</P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They gave Passes to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects, for the secure Trading of their Ships; and afterwards Took those very Ships <HI>who had their own Passes,</HI> which were <HI>Plundered and Robbed.</HI> How this agrees with <HI>the Faith of Nations,</HI> let all Men judge.</P>
<P><HI>To the Honour and Profit of the Nation,</HI> They made a <HI>Cruel and Unjust War on the</HI> Mogul<HI>'s Subjects;</HI> on purpose to <HI>Plunder them,</HI> and send home those Effects; thereby to <HI>avoid Paying their Just Debts.</HI>—</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>And having thus given <HI>a short Account</HI> of their having been a long time <HI>a Corporation, to the Honour and Profit of the Nation;</HI> I shall in the next place consider <HI>Their Stock, both at Home and A broad,</HI> which they pretend to be Intrinsecally Worth above <HI>150 per Cent.</HI> which is <HI>1100000</HI> l.</HEAD>
<P><HI>You have the Companies honest Words,</HI> That their Stock is worth above 1100000 <HI>l.</HI> — which it amounts to at 150 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and they asserted it it to be worth Intrinsically more, in the Answer they gave to the Regulations of the Lords of the Council last year. — And certainly <HI>No Man</HI> will doubt the Truth of what <HI>they say,</HI> when they value it but at 744000 <HI>l.</HI> — For to be sure, <HI>They <HI>will speak nothing but Truth;</HI></HI> it being well known what care they have always taken, <HI>to Assert nothing but what is So.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Their Estate at Home, is Visible:</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By</HI> their having sent out <HI>in Three Years time,</HI> viz. 1688/89, 1689/90, 1690/91, <HI>in Seven Ships,</HI> containing about 3000 Tunn, such a <HI>Prodigious Summ</HI> as 26000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By</HI> their having in <HI>England</HI> so <HI>Vast a Stock</HI> as 38901 <HI>l.</HI> 08 <HI>s.</HI> 08 <HI>d.</HI> to drive so <HI>Small a Trade</HI> as that to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> (being not above <HI>One Quarter of the Trade of the World,</HI>) as may appear by their own Accounts given in to <HI>Parliament</HI> in 1691, (including therein 9920 <HI>l.</HI> for their Buildings,) though they had sent out in Three whole Years time before about the <HI>full Summ</HI> of 26000 <HI>l.</HI> — and had about 9000 <HI>Tunn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Shipping</HI> arrived home, between the Time of their Accounts given in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Parliament</HI> in 1689, to that of 1691.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By</HI> their calling in 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> of their Stock before they could send out <HI>the last Years Ships,</HI> which was a publick Declaration to the World, they <HI>had a sufficient Stock</HI> to carry on their Trade.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>By</HI> their having <HI>so much Money</HI> left in <HI>England</HI> to carry on <HI>their Trade</HI> after the 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> was called in, that they are necessitated to draw in 744000 <HI>l.</HI> more this Year, <HI>to send out their</HI> 12 <HI>Ships,</HI> which <HI>they cannot do</HI> without it; and therefore they procured ⅓ to be appoint∣ed to be <HI><HI>paid down</HI> at the Subscribing,</HI> and ⅔ at the 10th. <HI>January,</HI> and have agreed to allow 10 <HI>per cent,</HI> discount, <HI>to have the whole paid pre∣sently,</HI> that so they may <HI>pay themselves</HI> the 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> they paid to send out the Ships <HI>last Year,</HI> and what they have since advanced to pay pro∣miscuous and other incident Charges for <HI>secret Services.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Their Estate Abroad is as visible.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI><HI>By</HI> their having sent home in a few years</HI> above 2000 Tuns of their Shipping empty.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI><HI>By</HI> their keeping their Ships</HI> so little a while in <HI>India,</HI> and sending them home with such <HI>considerable Cargoes</HI> and part full, when Goods were so <HI>Plenty,</HI> that they sold here for double or three times their usual Prizes. Two of these Ships now lately arrived, having been <HI>only about five years out,</HI> and Two of those sent out in 1689 and 1690 not yet returned, although Ships commonly stay out on that Voyage Eighteen or Twenty Months; <HI>which plainly shews</HI> the Reason that the Nation has not been supplied with <HI>East-India Commodities,</HI> has been (as they assert) because <HI>His Majesty</HI> would not let them have <HI>more Ships</HI> in 1689, and 1690.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI><HI>By</HI> their Farming out their Trade to Foreigners</HI> and others, to lade <HI>East-India Goods</HI> on their Ships on permission, and not Trading them∣selves, when those Goods were so plentiful here, that there was scarce any to be had, and that they sold them for <HI>double or treble</HI> as much as usual; which is a <HI>convincing Argument</HI> of the <HI>large Effects</HI> they have <HI>Abroad:</HI> And with what has been already observed, will fully make out their having there 828868 <HI>l.</HI> 00 <HI>s.</HI> 05 <HI>d. quick Stock,</HI> as was asserted by them in their Account given in Parliament, in 1691.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>By</HI> their having such a <HI>prodigious Summ</HI> of Money at <HI>Surratt,</HI> that their <HI>General or President,</HI> and all their <HI>Factors there,</HI> by reason of their Debts, are <HI>confined to the Town,</HI> and not permitted to stir out of it without a Guard <HI>to watch them:</HI> And having so <HI>much Stock there,</HI> and so large a Credit, that they are forced to <HI>borrow Money</HI> to pay for the <HI>Charges of their House keeping,</HI> when by their Accounts in 1691. they only pretended to have there 180000 <HI>l.</HI> besides all Debts and Demands paid.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI><HI>By</HI> their having had home in two Years</HI> such a vast <HI>number of Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and <HI>Goods,</HI> including this Ship now last arrived, makes together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ships Burthen about 1400 Tun; and <HI>much of their Cargo so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and fine, that it will scarce pay Custom, Freight and Demo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y"/>besides, that great part of the best Goods have been on permission for private Accounts, and in that time <HI>the Dutch</HI> have had home but Thirty-one Ships <HI>richly laden,</HI> containing about 15000 Tun, besides Three cast away, which shews that Goods <HI>cannot be had in the</HI> East Indies <HI>with∣out <HI>Money.</HI></HI></P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III. And having thus given an Account of their great <HI>Estate at Home and Abroad,</HI> I shall in the next place consider the Third <HI>Reason</HI> proposed, <HI><HI>because</HI> all their Charters,</HI> as well their Old ones as these Two <HI>lately obtained,</HI> are to be Confirmed by <HI>Act of Parliament.</HI></HEAD>
<P>You have the Assurance of the <HI>Company's Word,</HI> which they have <HI>never yet broke,</HI> and therefore it ought not to be mistrusted, <HI>that all their Charters</HI> shall be confirmed by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> they having by their Behaviour <HI>so well deserved it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because</HI> the Company have asserted <HI>for Law,</HI> That the <HI>King</HI> can exclude his Subjects from the <HI>East-India Trade</HI> without an <HI>Act of Par∣liament,</HI> which makes the Concurrence of the Parliament unnecessary; when <HI>His Majesty</HI> in his <HI>Message</HI> last Sessions tells them expresly, <HI>That their Concurrence is necessary to make a compleat and useful Set∣tlement of that Trade.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because</HI> it makes the Trade <HI>so Diffusive and National,</HI> by giving so <HI>small a share</HI> of it (as above 250000 <HI>l.</HI>) to Four or Five Men only, excluding none of the Nation from coming in who are weary of their <HI>Money.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Because</HI> a Stock of 744000 <HI>l.</HI> will certainly drive a <HI>much greater Trade to the</HI> East-Indies, and will be <HI>more National</HI> and <HI>Diffusive,</HI> and will also cope much better with the <HI>Dutch</HI> then so <HI>small</HI> a Stock as <HI>Two Millions raised by new Subscriptions.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Because</HI> the <HI>Company</HI> by treating the <HI><HI>Regulations</HI> of the Lords of the Council</HI> with so much Respect, and for the good Services which they have done the Nation, have obtained <HI><HI>a new Charter</HI> according to their own Desire,</HI> which they will make use of <HI>to ease <HI>those</HI> of their Money,</HI> who have a mind to come and subscribe; therefore they presume on the like requital also from the <HI>Parliament,</HI> by having their said Charters confirmed.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Because</HI> that this <HI>Company</HI> has been Establish'd by <HI>Two new Charters,</HI> when the <HI>Honourable House of Commons</HI> have twice addressed to have their <HI>Old Charters dissolved.</HI></P>
<P>And its very remarkable, the <HI>Company</HI> are now <HI>Established</HI> on the <HI>same Regulations,</HI> which were formerly proposed to them by the <HI>Lords of the Council</HI> (to which they gave the modest Answer which His Majesty sent the <HI>House of Commons last Session</HI>) with little other difference than this only, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Leading Men may keep <HI>their great Stocks,</HI> and have Liberty, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e they never so great,</HI> each Man to write in</HI> 10000 <HI>l.</HI> more, <HI>and <HI>are to
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>give no Security,</HI> to make the Stock worth</HI> 744000 l. <HI>or so much <HI>as any thing,</HI> and may <HI>divide</HI> out all again in six Months, if they please;</HI> and these Differences are <HI>such small Trifles,</HI> that they signifie nothing, considering their making so <HI>honourable a War</HI> on the <HI>Mogul,</HI> and at the same time <HI>making</HI> such large <HI>Dividends</HI> on purpose <HI>to put themselves out of the power of a Parliament,</HI> and to embroil the Trade, <HI>giving it in a manner wholly to the <HI>Dutch,</HI></HI> which are such <HI>good Services as may well re∣commend them;</HI> and they ought to prevail with <HI>all well meaning People, <HI>who are weary of their Money,</HI></HI> not to delay <HI>one Minute</HI> in subscribing; <HI>for they may be presently eased of it,</HI> without any trouble, <HI>at the</HI> East-India <HI>House.</HI></P>
<P>The Company certainly deserve very well to have 744000 <HI>l. given them in that Trade for nothing,</HI> seeing that if they have not <HI>some Ad∣vantage,</HI> they will have great cause to complain of <HI>a bad Bargain;</HI> but they are resolved, that those who come in <HI>shall pay the Fidler:</HI> And yet if any of them will be <HI>so just and honest</HI> as to help draw in the <HI>Simple and unwary, they shall be secured, <HI>especially</HI></HI> if they are of the ad∣verse Party, or can talk the thing <HI>well up and down</HI> the Town; <HI>for they shall have Dignified Men for their Security;</HI> that they shall loose nothing; but have Principle and Interest repayed, if they please, <HI>in twelve Months.</HI> And as for the loosing a <HI>good Name,</HI> that's a <HI>silly Thing,</HI> so as there be a Penny to be got by it. What's more common than to have <HI>decoy Ducks</HI> to fetch in Game; such Men shall have <HI>the Honour</HI> to serve for <HI>Trappanners</HI> to help deceive the unwary, whilst others will run away with the <HI>Benefit.</HI></P>
<P>What remains, is lastly to consider the 4th. <HI>Reason</HI> proposed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV. <HI>Because</HI> their <HI>Stock</HI> will <HI>Rise considerably</HI> here, so soon as these <HI>Subscri∣ptions</HI> are Compleated, or any <HI>Ships Arrive,</HI> although it be not worth <HI>much,</HI> and that the Company should not be Confirmed by Act of <HI>Par∣liament;</HI> and then one may easily <HI>Sell</HI> out again to <HI>Profit.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Doubtless</HI> some such <HI>Arguments</HI> were used formerly, to perswade some <HI>Persons to Buy Stock at</HI> 300 <HI>and</HI> 250 <HI>l.</HI> then was the time to Buy Stock? and so it is now; and the great <HI>Cause</HI> which they who followed that <HI>Advice,</HI> have to <HI>Thank</HI> them who gave it, is <HI>Reason</HI> sufficient to in∣duce them to <HI>follow it for the future;</HI> they believed the <HI>Doctrine</HI> then promoted, <HI>viz.

<PB N="7" REF="4"/><HI>made,</HI> can afford to sell much <HI>better Penny worths,</HI> than they who are but now <HI>come in;</HI> and they will be glad of the first <HI>Opportunity</HI> to slip out: <HI>Most People</HI> are perswaded to come in on this <HI>Prospect,</HI> and some to be sure must be <HI>disappointed:</HI> What if the <HI>Subscriptions</HI> should not be <HI>Compleated?</HI> Or what if their <HI>Ships</HI> now <HI>Abroad,</HI> should any of them <HI>Miscarry?</HI> Why then truly, they must make the best of a bad <HI>Bargain,</HI> and may again with as much Reason <HI>Complain</HI> of a bad <HI>Pennyworth,</HI> and will have just the same <HI>Relief,</HI> to be <HI>laugh'd</HI> at for their <HI>Pains,</HI> in <HI>meddling</HI> with what they did not understand.</P>
<P><HI>By what has been already Observed,</HI> it may plainly appear, that <HI>the late Company</HI> have been a long time <HI>a Corporation to the Honour and Profit of the Vation,</HI> and <HI>that their Stock is worth</HI> 744000 <HI>l. nay</HI> 1100000 <HI>l. and <HI>hat they will doubtless be confirmed by Act of Parliament, and that it will Rise considerably.</HI></HI> There might be much more added, if it were necessary, but this is thought sufficient to induce <HI>all indifferent People,</HI> who are weary of their <HI>Money,</HI> to join with them by <HI>new Sub∣scriptions,</HI> without delay, upon such great Encouragements as these are. I shall only add one thing more.</P>
<P>That it will serve to enable 2 or 3 <HI>men to pay themselves a considerable Sum of Money for what the Company owe them</HI> besides the last 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> which is now made a <HI>Debt,</HI> and to Pay their other Debts besides; which must likewise be paid out of this new <HI>Subscription Money;</HI> and they shall have so much the more Money paid them, if they will Subscribe it in the <HI>Stock. This is a very <HI>profitable and national</HI></HI> Design, <HI><HI>especially</HI> for those who are to receive the money out</HI> which is to be Subscribed in; and <HI>its worth observing</HI> how, that to incline people to pay in 50 <HI>l. per cent.</HI> last Summer, they allowed 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> discount, and raised the Stock above 100 <HI>per cent.</HI> that so the <HI>managing men</HI> might draw in others, and get out what Money they had advanced, <HI>and that they might also send out the six Ships</HI> which <HI>for want of money</HI> they were forced to keep till <HI>June,</HI> which should have gone in <HI>February</HI> before; and now they have ordered 10 <HI>l. per cent.</HI> discount for one months time, and they keep up the Stock at 93 <HI>l. per cent. <HI>to incline people to pay in all their Money freely</HI></HI> by the 10th of <HI>December,</HI> that so they may be able to send out <HI>their</HI> 12 <HI>Ships this Year,</HI> and also to <HI>Pay themselves</HI> what they have disbursed, together with the 50 <HI>l. per cent.</HI> they paid last year, and which is now <HI>to be Refunded; <HI>if people will put out their Eyes, and always be thus bubbled out of their Money as well as their Senses,</HI></HI> they may go on till they are weary▪ and perhaps this is done, that the old pretence might still be urged for their continuance, <HI>viz. <HI>That a great many Widows, Or∣phans, and Innocent and Ignorant People might not be Cheated and undone, if they should be Dissolved.</HI></HI></P>
<P>But let not these Gentlemen deceive themselves and others, Doubtless the <HI>Parliament</HI> will not be thus affronted, but will take notice of <HI>these <HI>Proceedings</HI></HI> and Assert the <HI>Right and Liberty of the Subject to to the Freedom of this Trade</HI> which has been thus violated, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oose <HI>sō great a Trade to the whole Nation,</HI> by giving it it either to
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>2 or 3 particular Men to make them <HI>as great as Dukes,</HI> or else to our <HI>Friends the Dutch,</HI> and therefore <HI>its to be hoped</HI> they will <HI>provide that all the Subjects of</HI> England <HI>may <HI>Freely Trade</HI> to the</HI> East-Indies, according to <HI>the Right</HI> whch they have <HI>by Law so to do, until this Trade be Setled by Act of Parliament;</HI> and thereby not only the <HI>Trade will be secured to the Nation,</HI> but the <HI><HI>Iust Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties of the People will be maintained and preserved.</HI></HI></P>

<P>I suppose these Reasons will be sufficient to convince any unin∣teressed persons, but if not, hereafter they shall have more: For the present I shall conclude with <HI>the Honest Popes Blessing</HI> on all those who are still willing to be <HI>deceived.</HI></P>
