<P>THE
Present CONDITION
OF THE
<HI>Muscovite</HI> EMPIRE,
Till the YEAR 1699.</P>
<P>IN TWO
LETTERS:
The First from a Gentleman, who was Conversant
WITH THE
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Ambassadour in <HI>Holland:</HI>
The Second from a Person of Quality at
<HI>VIENNA,</HI>
Concerning the late
<HI>Muscovite</HI> EMBASSY,
His present <HI>Czarish Majesty;</HI>
THE
RUSSIAN EMPIRE;
AND
<HI>GREAT-TARTARY.</HI></P>
<P>WITH THE
LIFE
Of the Present
Emperour of <HI>CHINA.</HI></P>
<P>By Father <HI>J. BOUVET,</HI> Missionary.
<HI>By</HI> the Author of the <HI>Antient and Present State of</HI> Muscovy.</P>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Two following <HI>Let∣ters,</HI>
which I have here
presented to the Reader,
being lately come to my hands, and
containing a short but most exact
and authentick Account of the pre∣sent
Condition of the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Empire, I thought I could scarce
do more acceptable piece of Ser∣vice
to the Publick at this Juncture,
than to communicate them to the
Curious. The first Letter was writ∣ten
by a Gentleman, who being at
<HI>Amsteldam</HI> at the time of that So∣lemn
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Embassy; and
whilst the <HI>Czar</HI> was there present,
had the Honour to be intimately
<PB REF="3"/>
acquainted with some of the <HI>Mus∣vites</HI>
of the first Rank there, which
gave him the opportunity to be in∣form'd
concerning these Matters,
which hitherto either are
not at all, or at least, but very con∣fusedly
come to our Knowledge.
Those who will seriously reflect
upon what this Gentleman has been
pleased to tell us concerning the
two. Sieges of <HI>Asoph,</HI> its true Situ∣ation,
Advantage and Strength;
concerning the present State of the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Navy, and their Mari∣tim
Affairs; with several other
most Curious Observations, relate∣ing
to his <HI>Czarish Majesty's</HI> Person,
especially since his departure out of
<HI>England,</HI> I suppose, agree with
me in Opinion, that this Account
is the most exact, and perhaps also
the mos;t authentick we have had
of this kind for many Years before.
The second being an Abstract of
several Letters written by a Person
of Quality then Residing at the
Imperial Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> gives us
<PB REF="3"/>
a faithful Account both of his own
Sentiments and of the whole Imperial
Court concerning the present State of
Affairs in <HI>Muscovy;</HI> with very Cu∣rious
Observations upon several re∣markable
Subjects, relating to the
last Peace with the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the
Way by Land through the <HI>Great-Tartary</HI>
into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Any one that will be at the
pains to compare the Maps the
Geographers have been pleased to
put upon the World formerly, of
the North Eastern Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI>
with this Account, will soon be
convinced of their Ignorance, when
they have represented this Part of
the World, which is Stock'd with
vast Numbers of Inhabitants, and
Water'd by so many great and fair
Rivers, as inhabitable Forrests and
Desarts. In the whole, these two
Letters may well be consider'd as a
Supplement of the <HI>Antient and Pre∣sent
State of</HI> Muscovy, published
at the time of His Czarish Maje∣sty's
being in <HI>England;</HI> many things
<PB REF="4"/>
of Moment which have happened
since, being inserted here, and re∣lated
upon the Credit of those
Persons, who had the opportunity
of taking the best Information that
can be expected of this kind. I
will not pretend to enlarge much
upon the Historical Portraicture,
given us by Father <HI>Bouvet,</HI> of the
present Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> sup∣posing
that his being an Eye-wit∣ness
of what he relates, and his
offering it to the most Christian
King, will be a sufficient Plea, both
for his Authority and Veracity, to
the unbyass'd Reader.</P>

<P>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</P>
<P>WHen I consider the Genius
of the Age we live in,
which is so much inclined to call in
question every thing that comes
from far Remote Places, I have all
the Reason in the World, to fear
that these Memories will undergo the
same Fate and will not meet with
that favourable interpretation, the
faithfulness and exactness where∣with
they are written, might just∣ly
Challenge from unqualified Per∣sons.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
But as I have not inserted the
least thing, of which I have not
either been an Eye-witness my self,
or else have received it my self from
unquestionable hands, so I am apt
to flatter my self, that the Reader
will look upon this Relation with
another Eye, than is commonly
done upon ordinary accounts; I
hope no body will think me so Im∣pudent,
as to dare to Present to the
most quick-sighted and greatest Mo∣narch
of the World, any thing
which is not in all its circumstan∣ces,
agreeable to Truth; which
must heeds bring upon me the just
Indignation of His Majesty, and
at the same time, be a means to
forfeit the Good Opinion of
the Greatest Emperour of the
<HI>Orient.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever the Spirit of Con∣tradiction
may be able to invent, to
render these Memoirs suspected to
the World. I don't question, but that
Truth which is represented here
without Contradiction, in its Genu∣ine
<PB REF="5"/>
Shape, will protect me both
here and in <HI>China</HI> against all gain∣sayers;
the only thing which I have
to relent at, being, that I have not
been able to represent in their full
Lustre all such Matters, as must
needs be infinitely pleasing to all,
who are truly Zealous for the pro∣pagation
of the Faith.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE
Most Christian King.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it please your Majesty.</OPENER>
<P><HI>THE Portraicture which I am
taking the Liberty to present
at this time to Your Majesty, is cer∣tainly
the One of the rarest and most
curious that has been brought from
the</HI> East. <HI>All the Memoirs both of
time past, and even of this Country,
can furnish us, but with very few Sub∣jects,
which, If I dare presume to
say so, are more worth Your Attention
and Cnriosity; I need not say any thing
more than, that it is the Portraicture
of a Monarch, who, having the good
Fortune to Resemble Your Majesty in
most Respects, enjoys the same Ad∣vantages
in reference to his great Sta∣tion.
among the Pagan Princes, which
Your Majesty is possess'd of in the
Christian World.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
<HI>The Jesuits, which by Your Maje∣sty
have been Employed, as Missiona∣ries
into</HI> China <HI>some years ago,
were not a little surprised to meet at
the utmost corner of the Earth with
what they had never seen before but
in</HI> France, <HI>that is to say, a Prince,
who, like Your self, has improved his
sublime Genius by that Greatness of
Soul, which alone renders hint worthy
of the greatest Empire of the Ʋni∣verse;
who bas the same uncontroul∣ed
Power over his Passions, at over his
Subjects, equally Adored by his Peo∣ple
and Esteemed by his Neihgbours;
who, as his Glorious Enterprizes have
been Crowned with Success, so stands
more indebted for it to his own Valour
and Conduct, than Fortune; In short, a
Prince in whom are center'd most of
these great Qualifications requisite to
makes an accomplish'd</HI> Hero, <HI>and who
would without question be accounted
the most Glorious Monarch upon Earth,
if his Reign had not been coincident
with that of Your Majesty.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
It must be confess'd that hitherto
be is so unhappy as to be a Pagan,
which makes him uncapable of these
most Eminent Prerogatives, without
which, all the other Royal Qualities
want the most solid Foundation; yet
it may be truly said of him, that he
has made a considerable step towards
it by the High Esteem he has of our
Religion, by the Satisfaction he takes
in the Conversion of his Subjects to
the Christian Faith, which gives its
no small hopes, that in time by the
Grace fo God, be entirely united to
the Church.</P>
<P><HI>For, considering what favourable
Inclinations God has been pleased to
inspire into his Heart for the Chri∣stian
Religion, by the means of our
Arts and Sciences we are not beyond
hopes, that one day he may prove the
Destruction of the Pagan Idolatry in</HI>
China; <HI>endeavouring</HI> in this, as in
many other things, to tread in the
footsteps of Your Majesty who have
made it Your Chiefest Glory, to root
out Heresie in your Dominions, and
<PB REF="7"/>
to propagate the true Religion thro∣out
all Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Will it not be the greatest Happi∣ness
and Glory of Your Majesty's
Reign, that the same Arts and Sci∣ences,
which have been brought to
the highest pitch of Protection; by your
Encouragement and protection, should
be the happy Instruments of these fa∣vourable
Inclinations, the present Em∣perour
of <HI>China shews for our Reli∣gion;
and if the Chineses</HI> should be
convinced in time of the Great ad∣vantage
the Truth of the Gospel has
over their vain Philosophy, to
serve as a Means both for the Sove∣raign
and his Subjects, to submit
themselves, notwithstanding all their
Self-conceit, (in which they surpass
most Nations) to the forcible truth
of the Christian Religion.</P>
<P>These are the hopes which may
be conceiv'd from true Historical
Portraicture of this Prince; the on∣ly
thing I fear, is, that the Pencil of
the Painter has done considerable
wrong to the Original. But if all the
<PB REF="8"/>
Lineaments are not so Nice and Ex∣act
as they should be I am sure they
are true; and all the Favours this Mo∣narch
has been pleased to heap upon
us, have not been Powerful enough to
induce me, to deviate in the least from
the Respect due to Your Majesty:
and Truth it self in so Nice a Point,
in which the Interest of the Gospel
which was never separated from Yours,
is so narrowly concerned.</P>

<HEAD>The Present
CONDITION
OF THE
Muscovite EMPIRE,
TILL THE
YEAR 1699,
In a LETTER from a Gen∣tleman,
who was Conversant
with the late Muscovite Am∣bassadours
in Holland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your last you desired me to acquaint
you with what I had been able to learn
concerning the present State of <HI>Musco∣vy,</HI>
during the Stay of that most solemn
Embassy of His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty in this Ci∣ty.
I am extreamly well pleased, you have
put me in the way of satisfying in some
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
measure your Curiosity, having by the fre∣quent
Conversation with the said Ambassa∣dours,
had the opportunity to inform my
self of several Matters of great Conse∣quence,
not commonly known in these
Parts. I cannot but be amaz'd at the
strange. Notions the greatest Part have
form'd to themselves of the present Con∣dition
of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> being prepossess'd
with an Opinion, that this Monarchy is of
so little Consequence in respect of the other
<HI>European</HI> Kingdoms, as scarce to be worthy
taking notice of.</P>
<P>But whoever will take the trouble to
make a true insight into the present Posture
of their Affairs, will be forced to confess,
that there are few Kingdoms in <HI>Europe,</HI>
which at this time may be look'd upon as a
more proper Object of our Curiosity.</P>
<P>It is not to be denied, but that before the
Year 1645, when Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovitz,</HI>
(his present <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Father) came
to the Crown, the <HI>Mascovites</HI> were much
more barbarous, that they cultivated but a
very slender Correspondence, and had but
little Commerce with foreign Nations; and
that being ill vers'd in all manner of Sci∣ences,
they were consequently very igno∣rant
of the Military Art and Discipline, at
least as it is practised now a-days in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
which was the true Reason of their
ill Success in so many Encounters, and that,
tho' naturally fierce and hardy, they were
frequently worsted by their Enemies, tho'
much interior in Number.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
The Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovitz,</HI> a Prince
of a vast Understanding, and a Great Po∣litician,
having immediately after his Ac∣cession
to the Throne, investigated the true
Cause of the Disadvantage, the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
lay under at that time, in respect of other
foreign Nations, applied all his Thoughts
to remove this Obstacle; The best Expe∣dient
he could pitch upon, was, to draw in∣to
his Service as many foreign Officers as
possibly he could, to instruct his Subjects in
the Modern Art of War; And the better
to compass his Design, he made use of all
the Politicks that could have been invented
by the most refined Politician. For being
sensible, that it would be no easie Task to
engage a considerable Number of well qua∣lified
foreign Officers into his Service, he
insensibly brought them over to his Party,
by the Promises of great Pay, of entire
Liberty of Conscience, of what Religion
soever; and by taking them into his Ser∣vice
but for a little time: all which was ve∣ry
punctually observed on his side. Thus
he put his projected Design in execution,
with so extraordinary Success, that accord∣ing
to the Account given by the Baron of
<HI>Meyerbergh,</HI> who was in the Year 1662,
sent by his present Imperial Majesty <HI>Leo∣pald,</HI>
as his Ambassadour into <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
there were among the foreign Officers in
the Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovitz</HI>'s Service, two
Generals, two Marshals de Camp, above a
hundred Collonels, a great Nnmber of Ma∣jors;
Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns, in
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
prodigious Numbers, who were all paid
very punctually: This Account coming
from a Person, who otherwise seldom speaks
well of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and their Affairs,
deserves to be particularly taken notice of
in this place.</P>
<P>These abovementioned Officers, having
made their Levies in divers parts of the
Country, subject-to the Obedience of the
Czars of <HI>Muschovy,</HI> and brought them under a
regular Martial Disciplines, did afterwards
in several Encounters with the <HI>Poles</HI> and
<HI>Swedes,</HI> give sufficient Proofs, that the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> don't want Bravery, when
they are led on by good and experienc'd
Officers. But, besides these new Levies, the
Czar had always on foot a certain standing
Number of old Troops, not unlike to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Legions; those the <HI>Muscovites</HI> call
<HI>Strelitzes,</HI> consisting of forty Thousand
Men, under the Command of the Chiefest
of the Nobility of the Empire.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed, that the in∣troducing
of a more regular Discipline a∣mong
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Forces, was not the
only Reason which induc'd the Czar <HI>Alexis
Michaelovitz,</HI> to entertain so vast a Num∣ber
of foreign Officers in his Service, it
having been prov'd by Experience, That
the same was in a great measure, founded
upon the Security of the Prince's Person,
who before that time, having committed
the whole Management of their standing
Forces to the Nobility, thereby gave them
frequent opportunies of abusing their Pow∣er
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
in opposition to the Royal Authority.</P>
<P>This Great Prince died in the Year 1676,
much lamented by his People, whose Dar∣ling
he was, as having not once, in all his
Reign, in the least abused his Absolute Pow∣er,
but given them a thousand Demonstra∣tions
of his Moderation, Justice and Pie∣ty.
It was he, that first changed the face of
Affairs of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, and laid
that Foundation, upon which the
Greatness of <HI>Muscovy</HI> has been built
since that time, and which is likely to be
brought to perfection, by the present Grand
Czar Peter <HI>Alexiovitz.</HI></P>
<P>He left the Succession of the Crown to
his eldestt Son, <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz,</HI> who reign∣ed
but six years, his early Loss was like∣wise
much lamented by his Subjects, being
a very Accomplish'd Person, and who had
given extraordinary hopes of a Good and
Great Prince, having exactly followed his
Father's footsteps, especially in what con∣cerns
the foreign Officers, and the Encou∣ragement
of Commerce. He was a great
lover of all Sciences, but especially of the
Mathematicks, and design'd to have all
the Houses of the City of <HI>Muscon,</HI> new
built of Brick, and the Streets pav'd with
Stones, if he had not been prevented by
Death; It was under his Reign, that Ge∣neral
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> of whom I shall have oc∣casion
to speak more anon, entred into the
Service of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> He was on a sudden, seiz'd
by a violent and continual Feaver, of which
he died in a few days afte; having before
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
his death appointed his younger Brother
<HI>Peter,</HI> begotten by second Adventure, his
Successour, as judging his own Brother
<HI>Ivan (John)</HI> who was of a weakly Consti∣tution,
uncapable of bearing the Burthen
of so Great an Empire.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>Peter Alexiovitz</HI> was pro∣claimed
Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> when he was
scarce eleven years of Age. By the Prin∣cess
<HI>Sophia,</HI> Daughter of the deceased Czar
<HI>Alexis Michaelovitz,</HI> by his first Marriage,
being of a very aspirng Temper, and na∣turally
disposed to Caballing, could not
brook to see her own Brother excluded from
the Succession to the <HI>Russian</HI> Throne; for
which Reason, she set all her Engines at
work, to put the Crown upon her Brother
<HI>Ivan Alexiovitz,</HI> or rather, her own Head.
The better to encompass this Design, she
took care to have it spread abroad, that the
late Czar <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz,</HI> her Brother, had
been poysoned by the Physicians, at the
Instigation of some of the Chief Men of
the Empire, whose Names were industri∣ously
published as the Anchors and Pro∣moters
of so hellish a Crime. Being sen∣sible
that nothing could strengthen her In∣terest
more, than if she, could draw the
<HI>Strelitzes</HI> into her Party; it was rumour'd
abroad, That a Design was form'd
against them at Court, it being resolved,
That the Strong Liquor which was to be
given at die Czar's Funeral, should
be mix'd with Poyson.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
This succeeded according to the Princes∣ses
Expectation, for the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> being En∣raged
by this sudden and unexpected News,
ran in a most Furious manner to the Pal∣lace,
where they began the Fray with the
Slaughter of two of the Czar's Physicians,
the Chief of whom was a <HI>Jew</HI> by Extra∣ction;
the next were some of the Princi∣pal
Officers of the Crown, such as were
mark'd out by the Princess, as being oppo∣site
to her Interest. Their Rage did not
stop here, but after they had committed a
thousand Insolences and Murthers, they
assaulted, and entred the Czar <HI>Peter Alexio∣vitz's</HI>
Lodgings, where they shew many of
his most faithful Officers and Friends of
the first Quality, in his presence, and then
proclaimed Prince <HI>Ivan Alexiovitz,</HI> Grand
Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>Pe∣ter
Alexiovitz.</HI></P>
<P>Thus a Calm succeeded the Storm which
however lasted not long. For the Princess
<HI>Sophia,</HI> whose Ambition was not satisfied
with seeing her Brother <HI>Ivan</HI> mounted up∣on
the Throne, entred into secret Cabals
With <HI>Fedor (Theodore) Chikolowitin,</HI> the Ge∣neral
of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> unto whom she re∣presented,
That she only having made use
of her Brother, as a Pretext to put the
Crown upon her own Head, she was wil∣ling
to make him her Spouse, and Associate
in the Empire, if he would join his Power
and Interest with hers; and that it would
be no difficult Matter to compass their De∣sign,
the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire being too heavy
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
a Burthen for the Shoulders of two Infants.</P>
<P>The General of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> not able to
resist such powerful Charms, they left no
stone unturn'd to bring their projected Design
to maturity, which was to be begun with
the Death of both the Czars, and would in
all humane probability have succeed accor∣ding
to their wish, if the Plot had not
been timely discovered to Their Majesties.</P>
<P>The two Czars having all the reason in
the World to mistrust the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> retired
thereupon to the Convent of <HI>Troitza,</HI> a
strong and well fortified place, about
twelve Leagues distance from the Capital
City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> where Monsieur <HI>Le Fort</HI>
gave them many signal Proofs of his Bra∣very
and Fidelity. To be short, they drew
the General of the <HI>Strelitzers</HI> into an Am∣bush
near <HI>Troitza,</HI> where being taken, he
was carried Prisoner into the Convent, and
had his Head cut off. He was a Person of
mean Extraction, who, as he had raised
himself to that height by his own Valour,
so he brought himself to a miserable End
by his Treachery; The Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> was
shut up in a Convent, where she is very
narrowly watch'd.</P>
<P>Quiet being thus recovered in the Go∣vernment,
by removing the Two Chief
Heads of the Rebellion, these Regiments
of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> as had shew'd themselves
most vigorous against the Czars Interest,
being divided into many small Bodies, were
sent into several parts of the Country un∣der
the Guard of some other Troops, whose
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Officers having received secret Instructions
to fall upon them at a certain appointed
time, they put their Orders in execution,
with so much Exactness, that very few es∣caped
their Hands.</P>
<P>It was particularly taken notice of at that
time, and sook'd upon as a Presage of the
future Grcatness of the present Czar <HI>Peter
Alexiovitz,</HI> that, when several of his nearest
Friends were massacred by the Rebellious
<HI>Strelitzes</HI> in his presence, he did not shew
the least Alteration in his Countenance, which
struck such an Amazement into the Soldi∣ers,
that they durst not presume to dethrone
him, but were contented to proclaim his
Brother <HI>Ivan</HI> his Associate in the Empire.
Those who have known his present <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty in his most tender Age, do unani∣mously
confess, That from his very Infancy,
there has been observed in him a certain
Greatness of Soul, and a piercing Wit,
much above the common Rank. He used
to be very seldom idle, but always in Acti∣on,
lively and brisk, and shew a great deal
of eagerness to be instructed in all Matters
of Moment, especially in what had any re∣lation
to the Manners and Customs or fo∣reign
Nations. He was scarce fifteen years
of Age, when he applied himself to the
Study of the Mathematicks, his Inclinations
tending more particularly to Navigation,
and other Mcchanick Arts, which he look'd
upon as the most Instrumental, to promote
these Great Designs, he has since put in
execution with a most stupendious Con∣duct
and Prudence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
In the last War betwixt the <HI>Turks,</HI> the
<HI>Emperour, Poland</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> was
Engaged in a War against the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
who being, as it was supposed, encouraged
by some Missionaries, had upon very frivo∣lous
Pretences attack'd the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> but
the <HI>Czar</HI> being resolved not to let slip so favou∣rable
an opportunity to act against the <HI>Ot∣tomans,</HI>
in conjunction with the beforemen∣tioned
Christian Princes, he chose rather to
abato something of his Pretensions to procure
a lasting Peace betwixt him and the <HI>Chi∣neses,</HI>
He had also all the Reason imagi∣nable
to promise himself a happy issue of
this War on his side, the <HI>Turks</HI> being at
that time by their ill Success, and the ma∣ny
Battels they had in <HI>Hungary;</HI> redu∣ced
to so low a condition, that they were
not in a capacity to make any considera∣ble
resistance; and he look'd upon the Con∣quest
of <HI>Asoph</HI> as a thing of so much con∣sequence
to the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Empire, that it
ought to be attempted at any rate, especi∣ally
since the Fortifications of that place
were in so different a Condition, as to give
him no small hopes of succeeding in this
Enterprize</P>
<P>Besides, this, the <HI>Czar</HI> was induced by ano∣ther
motive, which as it was nearer home, so he
look'd upon it as the most pressing in relation
to his own Person. He had as yet in fresh me∣mory
the rebellious inclinations of his Guards
he <HI>Strelitzes</HI> and did not question, but that by
this War he should find means to rid himself of
them, or at least to repress their Insolence,
by augmenting the number of foreign Of∣ficers,
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
well qualified and exercised in the
Military Art, whose Fortunes depending abso∣lutely
on him, he might intirely be assured
of their Service and Fidelity. Accordingly it
was resolved to make considerable new Levies
to be commanded by foreign Officers whose
number was augmented to eight thousand;
and the Troops under their Command being
in some time after, brought by their care
under a very regular Discpline in the
year 1695. The City of <HI>Asoph</HI> and <HI>Ka∣sikermeen</HI>
were both besieged the same time,
to render the relief of <HI>Asoph</HI> the more diffi∣cult
to the Enemy, this being the place
Chiefly aimed at by the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>Our Geographers do most commonly fix
the scituation of <HI>Asoph</HI> to the North of the Ri∣ver
<HI>Tanais</HI> on the side of the <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI>
whereas its true scituation is to the <HI>South,</HI> on
the side of <HI>Circassia,</HI> upon a rising ground ve∣ry
near the <HI>Palus Moetis.</HI> Neither is this
City built upon an Island, as it is represented
in some Maps, neither are any other Islands
to be seen thereabouts, either near the
mouth of the River, or in the <HI>Palus Moetis</HI>
it self, as it is likewise expressed in these
Maps, unless it be one very small Isle
which lies at the very mouth of the River
<HI>Tanais</HI> (now a-days called the <HI>Don</HI>) to∣wards
the North-west, very near the
Coastt.</P>
<P>About two Leagues above this Fortress,
the River <HI>Tanais</HI> emits a branch which
runs towards the North, in the form of
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
a Semy-circle before it enters the <HI>Palus
Moetis,</HI> but it is both very narrow and shal∣low.
A good way, beyond this, a little above
the Town, issues forth another Branch,
which ruuning likewise to the North in
the form, approaching, to a Semy-circle,
divides it self into five other Branches, just
before it disembogues into the Sea. But
this Branch is also of a very slender depth,
and the Ground thereabouts, through which
those several Channels pass, very low
and Marshy, so, that at high Water when
the Wind blows strong from the South,
which drives the Waters from the black
Sea, upon that Coast, all the Country here∣abouts
lies under Water.</P>
<P>You will, I suppose, be not a little sur∣prised,
when I tell you, that the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
in their Maps put <HI>Asoph</HI> under the
47th degree of Northern Latitude, and so
do likewise the <HI>Turks;</HI> whereas in our
Map; we find it under the 51 degree, or
thereabouts. But, what deserves our par∣ticular
observation is, That, our Maps a∣gree
exactly with theirs in the scituation
of that part of the Country where the <HI>Ta∣nais</HI>
or <HI>Don,</HI> approaches nearest to the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI> which both they and we put under
the 49th Degree. I can only thus much
assure you, that, the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who are
generally taken for very ignorant and unpo∣lish'd,
have composed the most exactest
Maps of their own Country in the World, I
having seen some of them my self; and that
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
they exclaim against ours, as very imper∣fect
in this point.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Asoph</HI> was formerly no more
than a small Place, fortified only with
one single Wall, after a very irregular
manner; its Form approaching to a <HI>Hexa∣gon,</HI>
two of its opposite sides lying near pa∣rallel
with the River, surrounded with ma∣ny
Towers, after the ancient Fashion. A∣bout
the middle of that side which is oppo∣site
to the <HI>West,</HI> there was a very large
Tower of a considerable heighth, round at
the bottom, running up like a Pyramid, but
flat on the top; within the body of the
Place there was another Retrenchment,
which supplied the place of a Cittadel, and
was provided always with a good Garrison.
The <HI>Turks</HI> afterwards surrounded the whole
with new Fortifications of Earth, compos'd
of our large and high Bastions, but not very
regular, yet is the Ditch both very broad and
deep. Two of these Bastions towards the <HI>South-East</HI>
Side lie pretty close to one another,
for the better defence of the place, in re∣spect
of the nearness of several Hills, which
else would command the Town. The third
Bastion to the <HI>South-West,</HI> is at a great di∣stance
from the other two, and the fourth
Bastion towards the <HI>West</HI> is yet further di∣stant
from the third. The Courtin betwixt
thest two last Bastions has in the midst an
Obtuse. Angle; the like has also the Courtin
towards the <HI>East,</HI> which, runs down to the
River; and on the River side it is very
well provided with strong Pallisadoes.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Besides this, they had built a little above the
Place two strong Towers of brick-work, and
of a quadrangular figure, one on each side
of the River, provided with good store of
Cannon, by which means, and a very strong
Chain, they prevented the <HI>Donaick Cosacks</HI>
from passing that way to the black Sea, who
formerly used to take the advantage of the
darkness of the Night, when they went a
Pyrating upon, the <HI>Turks.</HI> This was the
condition of <HI>Asoph,</HI> when the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
first laid siege to it, in the Year 1695.</P>
<P>It may well seem strange, that the <HI>Turks</HI>
should either so little understand the ad∣vantage
of the Scituation of this Important
Place, or else be so negligent in providing for
its Security, as not to take away all Hopes
from the <HI>Muscovites</HI> of succeeding in this
Enterprise. In my Opinion, it was not
only their highest Interest to have secured
a Place of so much Consequence against
any Attempt of this nature, by rendring it
Impregnable, but also to have as much as
possibly they could, extend their Conquests
on that side, by making themselves Masters
of the Country betwixt the Rivers <HI>Don</HI>
and <HI>Wolga,</HI> which thereabouts approach
within seven Leagues distance to one ano∣ther.
Besides which, there are two other
Rivers betwixt the <HI>Don</HI> and the <HI>Wolga,</HI> one
of which coming from the <HI>North East,</HI>
is pretty large, and discharges it self into
the River <HI>Don.</HI> The other much lesser co∣ming
from the <HI>South West,</HI> disembogues into
the <HI>Wolga.</HI> These two Rivers carry their
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
Currents within one League and an half
distance. These two Rivers, are invisible
in our. Maps, in lieu of which they have
obtruded upon us a suppositious River, called
<HI>Camus,</HI> which is not to be found therea∣bouts.
The Ground betwixt these two
Rivers is very convenient for Building of
Forts and Fortifications, there being but a
few small Rocks, which may be made
passable, and convenient enough for such
an Undertaking.</P>
<P>The Turks shewed themselves but indiffe∣rent
Politicians, and who had but a slender
insight in matters of this nature, when
they let slip so favourable an Opportunity
of extending their Conquests on that side
during the Intestine Troubles, which har∣rassed,
and almost destroyed the <HI>Mus∣tovite</HI>
Empire in our Age, at the same
time that the <HI>Ottomans</HI> were in a most flou∣rishing
Condition. If they at that time had
joined these two Rivers by a Canal, and
strengthened the same with some Forts; or
if they had built but one considerable Fortress
upon the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> the whole Kingdom
of <HI>Astracan</HI> must of necessity have fall'n into
their Hands, by which means it would have
been no difficult task for them to render
themselves Masters of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Lake, or
Sea, which is the Inlett into the Heart of
<HI>Persia,</HI> and at no great distance from the
<HI>Indies,</HI> Subject to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and for
the rest it is surrounded by a great number of
Petty <HI>Tartarian</HI> Princes, who might either
have been easily Conquered, or at least
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
brought over to their Party to make
them instrumental in the Conquest of
<HI>Asia,</HI> What would in such a Case have
become, of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who would
have been continually allarm'd, and
harrassed on all sides by an infinite
number of <HI>Tartars,</HI> by those of the <HI>Cri∣mea,</HI>
of <HI>Circassa, Bulgaria,</HI> by the <HI>Calmuck</HI>
and <HI>Mogul Tartars,</HI> who like a Torrent
would have over-run this vast Empire, and
would have rendred the Conquest of all the
Circumjacent Countries as cheap and easie
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> as these Vagabonds formerly
did, when they took up Arms under those
Renown'd Heroes, <HI>Ginghis Khan,</HI> and <HI>Ta∣mur
Lenek.</HI></P>
<P>These, are two things which pre∣vented
the <HI>Turks</HI> from making use of that
critical Juncture to their Advantage. The
first was, that they look'd upon the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
as too inconsiderable to stand ever
in Competition with them, seeing they had
not Courage enough to accept of the For∣tress
of <HI>Asoph</HI> from the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> who had
taken it by Surprise. The second was, That
the were not so fully satisfied of the
Consequence and use of a good Naval
Strength, by which means they might
most conveniently have enlarged their
Dominions on that side, and carried the
terror of their Arms not only along the
<HI>Wolga,</HI> but also by the way of the <HI>Caspian</HI>
Sea into the very heart of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>Bat to return to the Siege of <HI>A∣soph.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
The <HI>Turks</HI> had provided the City of
<HI>Asoph</HI> with great Stores of Ammunition
and Provision, and all other things ne∣cessary
for a long and vigorous Defence,
the Garrison consisting of ten Thousand
chosen <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars;</HI> notwithstanding
which, the present <HI>Czar Peter Atexiovitz,</HI>
resolved to besiege it in Person. His Ar∣my
consisted of one Hundred Thousand
Foot, and twenty Thousand Horse, all
chosen Troops, arid among them the
whole Body of his Guards, or <HI>Strelitzes,</HI>
commanded under the <HI>Czar,</HI> by a great
many good and Experienced Generals.</P>
<P>Whilst they were busy in persecting the
Lines of Circnmvallation, and Contravalla∣tion,
and carrying on the Trenchcs, the <HI>Czar</HI>
ordered a smal1 Fort of four Bastions to be
made at some distance above the two a∣bovementioned
brick Towers on the <HI>South</HI>
side of the River, upon a piece of Ground
that lies betwixt, and is encompassed by
two small branches which spring out of
that River, and re-unite themselves about
half ways distance betwixt these Towers
and the City. All the Communication
being cut oft betwixt the Place and the
Towers by these two branches, it was
hot long before the <HI>Muscovites</HI> made them∣selves
Masters of them, and it, being judg∣ed
most expedient to Fortifie that, on the
<HI>South</HI> side of the River, it was immediately
put in Execution accordingly, by surround∣ing
it with three good Bastions, and an
Angle on each of the Courtins on the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
River side. The Fort was called <HI>Calansa.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the Trenches were
carried on with the utmost Expedition and
Vigour, especially on the <HI>South East</HI> side of
the Place, where the <HI>Muscovites</HI> being ad∣vanced
to the top of the Hills, which in
some measure command the Town, they
Fired most furiously out of their Cannon,
and threw a prodigious number of
Bombs into the Place, by which means
they hop'd soon to terrifie the Garrison to
come to a Capitulation; but those within
consisting of old and well Disciplin'd
Troops, who were not to be vanquish'd at
a distance, the Trenches were carried on to
the body of the Place, but not without
great Slaughter on the <HI>Muscovite</HI> side; the
Enemies by their frequent and vigorous
Sallies disputing every Inch of Ground
with the utmost bravery. The <HI>Muscovites</HI>
were likewise couragiously repulsed in se∣veral
Attacks before they could lodge them∣selves
upon one of the bastions, where the
Garrison, like desperate Men, fell upon
them with such an incredible Fury, that
the <HI>Russians</HI> after a most obstinate Defence,
were forced to quit it at last, with the loss
of a great number of their Men, especially
of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> who, as they were most
exposed, so they bore most commonly the
greatest Share in the loss, the <HI>Czar</HI> making
use of this Opportunity, both to try their
Valour, and rid his Hands of them in a
handsome way; though at the same time
it must be confess'd to his Immortal Glory,
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
that he was not sparing of his own Per∣son,
but exposed himself to the Enemies
Fire as well in the several Attacks
that were made, as upon other occasions,
having had several Persons slain by his side
in the Sallies made by the Besieged. The in∣vincible
Resolution of the Garrison thus
protracting the Siege beyond all Expecta∣tion,
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> began to be in want
both of Ammunition and Provisions, which,
together with the approaching cold and
wet Season, obliged them to change the
Siege into a Blockade.</P>
<P>But the Disgrace received before <HI>Asoph,</HI>
was in some measure recompensed by the
Conquest of <HI>Kasiker meen,</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> City
Scituated on the <HI>South</HI> side of the River
<HI>Boristhenes,</HI> about two Leagues distance
from the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>It is encompassed by four strong brick
Forts of a quadrangular Figure, and an e∣qual
bigness, adjoining to one another.
Three of them lye upon a strait Line, but
the Fourth makes up a right Angle with
the Second. The first of these Quadrangu∣lar
Forts lies upon the very Bank of the
River <HI>Borishenes,</HI> being Flancked with
several good Towers as well as the two o∣thers,
which are upon the same Line. But
the fourth exceeds the three others in
Strength, being on one side provided, in∣stead
of Towers, with two large, and high
Bastions, surrounded with a good Ditch.</P>
<P>Just opposite to the place you see a
small Island in the River <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> re∣sembling
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
in form, a Neats Tongue, called
in their Language <HI>Towan.</HI> Upon this Island
the <HI>Tartars</HI> had erected two Forts of four
Bastions each, which on the upper end of
the Island was called <HI>Momberethkermenn;</HI>
as the other on the lower part was named
<HI>Muftritkermeen;</HI> on the opposite side of the
River belonging to the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI> there
was also another Fort in all respects like to
the other two, just over against <HI>Momba∣rethkermeen,</HI>
upon the Bank of the before
mentioned River <HI>Boristhenes.</HI></P>
<P>The Army of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was
chiefly compos'd of <HI>Cossacks,</HI> inhabiting
those parts, and who some years before had
submitted to the <HI>Czar's</HI> Obedience. To
facilitate the Siege of <HI>Kasikermeen,</HI> it was
resolv'd to Attack first the said Forts, which
being done, accordingly they were soon ta∣ken
by the brave <HI>Cossacks</HI> who imme∣diately
after laid Siege to the Place it∣self.</P>
<P>The train Attack was carried on against
the Fort with the two bastions, the Ground
thereabouts being most proper for the car∣rying
on of the Trenches, which were ad∣vanc'd
with so much Expedition, that in
a short time they carried in by Assault. The
Enemies however got time to retreat into
the other Forts, where having beat a Par∣ley,
it was agreed that they should March
out of the Place with their Arms and Bag∣gage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="18"/>
The <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army on that side was
commanded by the General <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI>
who having contrary to the Capitulation,
connived at some disorders committed by
the <HI>Cossacks</HI> against the Garrison; his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty was so much dissatisfied at it, that
he shewed his Resentment in very hard
Terms to the General. He, who did not
expect such a Reprimand, desired thereup∣on
leave from the <HI>Czar</HI> to lay down his
Commission, which being readily granted
him likewise beyond his expectation, he, after∣wards
repented atleisure. The better to divert
himself in this Melancholly Disposition, he
resolved to Travel in Forreign Countries,
and you are not ignorant, how he visit∣ed
most of the Courts of <HI>Italy,</HI> and had the
Curiosity to go to the Isle of <HI>Maltha,</HI>
where, as well as in all other Pla∣ces,
thro which he Travelled, he was re∣ceiv'd
with all imaginable Respect due to
his Birth and Merits.</P>
<P>The succeeding Winter was chiefly ta∣ken
up with vast Preparations for the next
ensuing Campaign, which being to be o∣pened
with the Siege of <HI>Asoph,</HI> great stores
of Ammunition, Bombs, and Provisions
were got in readiness for that Enterprise
to prevent the <HI>Turks</HI> from sending any
Relief by Sea; many Gallies and Brigan∣tines
were order'd to be built near the City of
<HI>Muscow,</HI> but especilly at <HI>Veranowitz,</HI> a City
Scituate on the River. <HI>Don,</HI> about a Hundred
Leagues distant from the Capital City. But
what is most remarkable is that the <HI>Czar Pe∣ter</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
having a particular curiosity to be pre∣sent
at the building of some of the biggest
Gallies, he caused them to be set upon the
Stock, in the River <HI>Ocea,</HI> at some small
distance from the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> they
being from thence to be Transported to
<HI>Veranowitz,</HI> by Land, were so artifici∣ally
contrived, that they might be taken
to pieces without much trouble, and so be
joined together again at <HI>Veranomitz.</HI></P>
<P>To be short, by the great Vigilancy of
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, all things were got
in such forwardness, that there was no∣thing
wanting to put the projected Design
in Execution.</P>
<P>'Tis to be observ'd that the City of <HI>Asoph</HI>
had been kept block'd up during the
whole Winter, and that the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
having maintain'd their Post all this while
upon the abovementioned Hills, which o∣verlook
the Place, they had been so In∣dustrious
in guarding all the Avenues, that
the Besieged had not receiv'd the least Sup∣ply
of Men, or Provisions. To cut off all
further hopes of Succours, it was resolved
to open the Campaign very early in the
Spring, for which purpose all the Troops
design'd for this Expedition, were order'd
to March to their Rendezvous, and from
thence strait to the Siege of <HI>Asoph,</HI> which
was begun by throwing a most prodigious
quantity of Bombs into the place, with
such extraordinary Success, that the whole
Body of the city was reduced to Ashes,
and Rubbish, and the old Fortifications to
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
one large Stone heap, so that there was
scarce a place left for the Garrison to shel∣ter
themselves against the fury of the Ene∣mies
Cannon and Bombs, all being de∣stroyed
even to the deepest Vaults and
Caves.</P>
<P>Besides which, the Number of the be∣sieged
was reduced to less than two thou∣sand
Men capable of bearing of Arms,
both by the furious Attacks made upon
the place in the last years Siege, and the
continual firing from the <HI>Muscovites</HI> Great
Artillery, and throwing in of Bombs; in
this; not withstanding which, they were
deaf to any proposals of a surrender,
living in hopes of the promised Succours.</P>
<P>At last it appeared, to their great Joy
and Satisfaction, consisting of twelve Gal∣lies,
a great number of Saiques laden with
Provisions and Ammunition, and a good
number of fresh Troops, besides fifty thou∣sand
Ducats, to be distributed among those
brave Fellows that had so Valiantly de∣fended
their Post.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having before-hand
received Intelligence of the approach of
this Succours, had caused seven of his
largest Gallies, of a hundred foot length
each, besides several lesser, and a great
number of Brigantines to pass that small
branch of the <HI>Don,</HI> which issues forth a lit∣tle
above the Town As the Water is ve∣ry
shallow in this Channel, so it was not
without a great deal of difficulty, that the
largest Gallies could be brought along that
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
way, and would in all likelihood have
scarce succeeded, if the <HI>Czar</HI> by his Pre∣sence
and Encouragement had not anima∣ted
the Workmen to surpass all Difficulties,
which at last they did, to the no small A∣stonishment
of the besieged.</P>
<P>This Obstacle being happily surrnounted,
his Czarish Majesty judged it of very great
consequence for his purpose to plant good
Store of Cannon upon the little Island we
have mentioned before, because the Shoar
being very low, the Cannon-ball would
strike even with the surface of the Water;
besides, that the greatest part of the Isle
being covered with Wood, did prevent the
Enemy from discovering the Design.</P>
<P>The same favourable disposition of this
Island furnished the <HI>Muscovites</HI> with an
Opportunity of putting some of their
lightest Gallies and Brigantines for a Re∣serve,
behind the Isle, unperceiv'd by the
Enemy, whom, they intended thus to at∣tack
both in Front and Flank, as they pas∣sed
by that way, which succeeded accord∣ing
to Expectation.</P>
<P>For, all these Precautions having been
taken before the Enemies Fleet came in
sight, some of the biggest <HI>Muscovite</HI> Gal∣lies,
with many Brigantines were sent out
to meet them, making a Show, as if they
intended to Engage the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet;
but no sooner were they come within Can∣non
Shot of one another, but the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
feigning to dread the <HI>Ottomaa</HI> Fleet,
superior in Number to them, made a run∣ning
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
Fight, making the best of their way
towards the Shoar, and posted themselves
below the Island. The <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving
the Enemy to fly before them, and not in
the least forewarn'd of the red that laid
behind the Island, thought themselves, by
the small number of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Gal∣lies,
that appear'd in sight, assur'd of the
Victory.</P>
<P>Flush'd with these hopes, they made all
the Sail they could to fall in among the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> but no sooner were they come
within reach of the Cannon from the Isle,
but they receiv'd such a warm Salute from
thence, that they saw their Gallies torn to
pieces on all sides by the Enemies Cannon,
in an insant, with a great Slaughter of
many of their Men. Bur this was
only the fore-runner of what was to
ensue.</P>
<P>For his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, who had a
watchful eye on all sides, and who was
sometimes upon the Isle, sometimes on
board the Fleet of Reserve, that lay be∣hind,
having soon observed the Consterna∣tion
the <HI>Turks</HI> were put in by this unex∣pected
Salute, and willing to improve their
Confusion to his Advantage, got on board
in Person one of the lightest Gallies, Man'd
only with forty Men, giving the Signal
for the rest to follow him with all the Oars
they could. Thus the Enemy found them∣selves
surrounded on all sides by the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
who attack'd them with great bravery;
the <HI>Czar</HI> himself boarding the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ad∣miral,
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
and being successfully, seconded by
the rest, the Victory was almost as soon
completed as begun, the <HI>Turks</HI> being routed
so entirely, that not one Gally escaped,
but what was either sunk or taken; and it
must be confess'd, That the <HI>Czar</HI> shew'd
so much Conduct during the whole Action,
that no more could have been expected
from the Prudence and Valour of the great∣est
Captain of our time.</P>
<P>So compleat a Victory soon decided the
Destiny of <HI>Asoph,</HI> for the Garrison, who
had been Spectators of their Loss, being
now bereav'd of all Hopes of Succours,
demanded a capitulation. In confederation
very honourable of their bravery, they had
Conditions granted them, it being com∣prehended
in one of the Articles, that be∣fore
their, marching put of the Place, they
should surrender to the <HI>Muscovites</HI> a cer∣tain
Officer, who had desearted his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's Service, and discovercd what
he knew concerning his Designs to the
Enemy. The <HI>Czar</HI> to recompence the
Sea-Officers and others on board his Fleet
for their last Service, and to give them
some marks of his Liberality, ordered
the Fifty Thousand Ducats, taken
oil board the <HI>Turkish</HI> Admiral, to be
distributed among them.</P>
<P><HI>Asoph</HI> was no sooner surrendred, but
the <HI>Czar</HI> made it appear to all the World,
that he was sufficiently sensible of what
Consequence the Conquest of this Place
was to his Affairs. For, the first thing he
<PB N="27" REF="21"/>
did, was to give his Orders for the resto∣ring
the Fortifications, and bringing them
with all possible Speed, to a state of De∣fence;
and not content with this, he
caused the Ancient Walls within the For∣tifications,
for the most part rain'd by
the Bombs, to be entirely rased, and in
lieu thereof, the Foundation was laid of
a new City, td extend to the Fortifica∣tions
made of Earth.</P>
<P>Those were likewise considerably aug∣mented
by the Addition of two new
Bastions in the same places where we
mentioned before the two obtuse Angles
to have been. All the ancient Bastions
were enlarged, and made regular, accor∣ding
to our modern Rules of Fortification;
each of them being strengthened by a
Half-Moon. The Ditch was defended by
a good Counterscarp, with a cover'd
way, from whence was carried a Line
up to the top of the Hill, which over∣looks
the Town, where a goodly Fore
was erected (or the Defence of the Line,
and to keep a Communication with the
Place.</P>
<P>All these Precautions, though very con∣siderable
in themselves, yet were thought
insufficient in respect of the Accomplish∣ment
of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Design, who
was resolv'd to render <HI>Asoph</HI> impregnable;
as being the main Frontier place on that
side of the Empire. Pursuant to this
Design, the Foundation was laid of a new
Fortress, just opposite to <HI>Asop,</HI> in the marshy
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
Grounds, which was to have a Communi∣cation
with that City by a bridge of thir∣ty
Arches to be built over the Marshes.
This Design, of which I have seen the
Model, was soon put in Execution, the
City which was to be put in the Center of
the place being called <HI>St. Peter.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Body of the Fortifications
consisted of six Bastions, the two first
facing the River side, with a Half-Moon
betwixt them. The other two Bastions
lying on each side are at a small distance
from the others; but the two opposite to
the <HI>North,</HI> lye at a much greater distance,
defended by three Half-Moons The
whole is surrounded with a double Ditch,
and a cover'd way. The Ground upon
winch this Fortress was built, is raised to
that heighth, as to command <HI>Asoph,</HI> and
when the Wind blows from the <HI>South,</HI>
the Marshes round about the Fortress are
all under Water, so that there is but one
way to approach it to wit, by the Bridge.</P>
<P>These Fortifications would have been
more than sufficient, if His Majesty had
had no other design than to defend his Fron∣tiers,
to bridle the <HI>trim Tartars,</HI> and to keep
the neighbouruing <HI>Cosacks</HI> inhabiting the Coun∣try,
near the <HI>Don,</HI> in awe, but this Monarch
had matters of greater Consequnce in view,
which he knew would in a little time
redound to the great benefit of the Em∣pire.
His design was to make use of this
place to serve for the conveniency of carry∣ing
down the River the Commodities of
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
the product of <HI>Muscovy</HI> into the <HI>Palus
Maeotis,</HI> and to transport them by the
way of <HI>Caffa,</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> into
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>He wisely foresaw that by this means he
might introduce, and settle Navigation in
his Dominions, to the great encrease of the
Wealth of his Subjects, who thereby
would be used to the Sea, so that in time
they might render themselves redoubtable
to their Enemies. But to bring this great
and noble Design to Perfection, it was ab∣solutely
necessary to put the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Fleet into such a Condition, as to be able
to coop with the <HI>Turks</HI> in the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> and
to render themselves so formidable, that
the Enemies might be obliged at the next
Peace to allow them a free Commerce, and
the Liberty of their Ports upon those
Coasts, and of <HI>Constantinople</HI> it self.</P>
<P>By the restoring, and strengthning the
Fortifications of <HI>Asoph,</HI> and laying the
Foundation of the new Fortress of St.
<HI>Peter,</HI> the present <HI>Czar</HI> had in view three
great Points, each of which, as it tended to
the great benefit of the Empire, so it was
sufficient to Eternalize his Memory.</P>
<P>The first was the making of a conveni∣ent
and safe Harbour, capable to contain
a great Fleet.</P>
<P>The second, the joining of the two Ri∣vers,
the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and <HI>Don,</HI> by a Canal, fit
to carry Ships of a great bulk.</P>
<P>And Lastly, the building, and equipping
of fourscore Men of War, as well Frigats
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
as Gallies, with a hundred and fifty Brigan∣tines,
to make Head against the <HI>Turks,</HI> where∣ever
they should attempt to dispute with
him the free Commerce at Sea.</P>
<P>It was found quite impracticable to ren∣der
<HI>Asoph</HI> a good Port; for, tho' the Ri∣ver
<HI>Don</HI> is the most proper in the World
for Shipping betwixt <HI>Veranowitz</HI> and <HI>Asoph,</HI>
as being very deep, without any Islands,
and its Current very smooth, being not
interrupted by any Sands; but the Mouth.
of this River is so full of Shelves, and
choak'd up with Sands, that at Ebb-Tide
there is not above seven Foot Water, so
that those Geographers who have describ'd
us the Entrance of this River as very con∣venient,
and one of the moil famous Ports,
have imposed their own Inventions upon
the World for Truth.</P>
<P>It was for this reason His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
ordered the Coast thereabouts to be found∣ed,
being willing to find out a convenient
Place to make a Port of, as near as possi∣bly
could be to the City of <HI>Asoph.</HI> When
the <HI>Turks</HI> formerly used to send any Ships
of a considerable burthen to that Town,
they were, obliged to unload near the En∣trance
of the River <HI>Mious,</HI> in the <HI>Crim
Tartary,</HI> about five and twenty Leagues
distancc from <HI>Asoph,</HI> where at Low Water,
it is at least fifteen or sixteen Foot
deep.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mauscovites</HI> sounding along the same
Coast, came to a certain Cape at about seven
Leagues disteance from the <HI>Don,</HI> where, at
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
an Ebb Tide there was twelve Foot, Water.
The Coast was hereabouts very high, and
steep, the Ground Sandy, but so hard
that it resembled both in Substance and
Hardness a Free-Stone. To the <HI>East</HI> of the
Cape there was a small Bay, and at about
a Leagues distance from thence to the
West there was a small River, whose Cur∣rent
turn'd in form of a Half-Moon, round
that Point of the Land. The Shoar
from the bay was of an easie Ascent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> having been exactly informed
Concerning the convenient Scituation of this
Place, order'd a Fort of Five bastions to
be erected, and a City to be built some∣what
below it, likewise defended by a good
Fortification, betwixt vvhich and the Bay
there was a Plain, through vvhich vvas to
be cut the great Channel, which was to
dissembogue near the Point, of the Land,
into the Sea; and in the midst of this,
there vvas to issue another less Channel
tovvards the Bay, for the conveniency, of
Vessels of less burthen. I have seen the
Model of the vvhole Design. The Port
is to be, Three Thousand Seven Hundred
and Fifty Foot long, and half as
broad.</P>
<P>Concerning the Conjunction of the
Rivers, <HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>Don,</HI> vve have already
mentioned before the advantageous Scitua∣tion
of the, Grounds betwixt the tvvo Ri∣vers,
and the condition of the tvvo lesser
ones, which come within a much nearer
distance of one another, so that the whole
<PB N="32" REF="24"/>
design being founded upon very good
Grounds, it will succeed in all Probability. For
it is proposed to stop the Waters of these
two lesser Rivers, which are to be join'd
in the Grand Canal by many Sluices, to
bring them to such a heighth as sha11 be
judged sufficient for the passage of Ships of
a considerable burthen; there are daily
above tvventy Thousand Men Employed to
dig the Ground, besides others who are
to bring the vvhole to Perfection.</P>
<P>As to vvhat relates to the third part to
wit, his Navy, it must be confessed that the
<HI>Czar</HI> made use in this Point of all the fore∣sight
and Prudence that could be e expected
from the molst refin'd Politician. For, be∣ing
immoveable in his Resolution of rid∣ding
his Hands of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> that used
to stand under the Command of the best
of the <HI>Russian</HI> Nobility, he judged not
vvithout Reason that at this Juncture
he could not pitch upon a more seasona∣ble
and more glorious Expedient than
this, to Employ them in the Service of their
Country, and at the same time to take
away from them all opportunities of fu∣ture
Revolts, Pursuant to this Resolution;
he issued his Declaration, wherein he told
them that the Present State of Affairs be∣ing
such, as required the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to ap∣pear
formidable at Sea, and he being
fully convinced, both of their Valour, and
Fidelity, he wished nothing more at this
time, than to see them apply themselves
to the Knowledge of Maritime Affairs,
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
to qualifie themselves for the best Com∣mands
at Sea. That for this purpose he
had taken all imaginable care to provide
a sufficient. number of Sea Officers, Fa∣mous
for their Skill in Maritime Affairs,
and the managing of Sea Engagements,
under whose Conduct they might be
trained up in this Art, and fitted for the
highest Commands. That he being re∣solved
to try the Foundation of the
present Glory of the <HI>Russian</HI> Monarchy up∣on
its Naval Strength, and rendring him∣self
redoubtable at Sea, would head them
in Person, and shew them by his own Ex∣ample
what Footsteps to tread in. According∣ly
it was resolved, that each Subject, propor∣tionable
to his Ability, should contribute to
the Equipping, and maintenance of a cer∣tain
number of Men of War, the chief Ci∣ties
of the Empire, being like wise obliged to
bear a proportion in this Tax, By this
means His Majesty Equipped a good Fleet
without the least impairing his ordinary
Revenue, and engaged at the same time
the Nobility, and chief Men in the Cities
to take. Cognizance of Maritime Affairs,
to render themselves capable of the Sea∣Service,
which they were to look upon
for the future, as the main and most du∣rable
Establishment of the whole Em∣pire.</P>
<P>These several Projects were no sooner
set on foot with the utmost Expedition,
by the most admirable Vigilancy, and
indefatigable Care of the <HI>Czar,</HI> put towards
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
<HI>Autumn,</HI> he set out on his Journey in or∣der
to his return to the Capital City of
<HI>Muscow,</HI> leaving a great body of his
Troops under the Command of the <HI>Gene∣ralissimo</HI>
of his Armies, the Prince <HI>Alekis
Simoniwitz Schein,</HI> near <HI>Asoph,</HI> to cover
the Workmen that were Employed in
bringing the Works projected thereabouts
to Perfection. At his Arrival in the City
of <HI>Muscow,</HI> he was received with all the
Demonstrations of Honour due to a Con∣querour,
Marching along the Streets to the
Cattle in Triumph, with a great many Cha∣riots
loaden with the Spoils of the Enemy,
and Prisoners, before him. Among the
rest was to be seen the Officer, who having
Deserted the <HI>Czar's</HI> Service, was surrender'd
to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> pursuant to the Capitu∣lation
before <HI>Asoph;</HI> had his Hands tied
behind him, and was soon after Executed,
as a Terrour to others. It is past Expres∣sion,
with what loud and joyful Acclamati∣ons
this publick Entry was Solemnized by
the People, who flocked thither from all
Parts to adorn the Triumph of the Con∣quering
Prince. Great were the Rejoicings
that were made that Night all over the Ci∣ty,
but the best was reserved till the Win∣ter:
when a most Glorious Firework was
let off upon the Ice.</P>
<P>The whole was composed of several Ar∣tificial
Machines, inclosed in a double Square,
surrounded with Rockets of all sorts and
Sizes, which took up a great space upon
the Ice.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="25"/>
His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty took a particular
Delight to be among the Engineers, and
had himself a Hand in making the greatest
Machine, which was erected in the very
Center of the rest. It was a double Spread
Eagle, who with his left Paw darted Roc∣kets
upon an Horrizontal Line at one of the
Horns of a Half-Moon, which succecded
according to Wish the Fireworks conti∣nued
all the Night long, the whole Design
of it being laid by His Majesty himself,
and drawn with his own Hand, which he
did me the Honour to shew me in Per∣son.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding that the whole Empire
seem'd to take Share in the Glorious Conquest
of their Prince, and that nothing but Feast∣ings,
and Rejoicings were to be seen in all
Parts, during the whole Winter; there
remained nevertheless, a certain dis∣contented.
Party among the Nobility,
who being encouraged by the secret Ca∣bals
of the Princess <HI>Sophia;</HI> found means,
in spight of her Confinement, to keep an
underhand Correspondence with her, for
the promoting their Designs against the
<HI>Czar's</HI> Person. They were so well pre∣pared
for the Undertaking of any Enter∣prize
of this Nature, that there wanted but
little Fuel to kindle the Flame; They
Could not brook the Loss of their belo∣ved
<HI>Strelitzes,</HI> whom they had always
looked upon as the Chief Supporters
of, their Authority; which at last made
them conceive so implacable a Hatred a∣gainst
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
the Czar, that they entred into a Con∣spiracy
against his Life. To put their Design
in execution, they had brought over to
their Party four Captains of the first Re∣giment
of the <HI>Strelitzes;</HI> but the difficulty
was, in what manner the Attempt was to
be made For they look'd upon it as im∣practicable,
to declare openly against a
Prince, who, besides that he was much be∣loved
by the People, had at his devotion
a good Number or the best Troops, Com∣manded
by foreign Officers, who were
quartered in and about the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI>
and ready upon all Occasions to sacrifice
their Lives for His Majesty. It was pro∣posed
among them, That the Czar was
used to go sometimes abroad with very
slender Attendance, and to appear in the
Streets of <HI>Muscow</HI> without any considera∣ble
Retinue; this was also look'd upon as
too dangerous, considering the general Love
the People bore to his Person.</P>
<P>After many Debates, it was at last re∣solved,
That considering that Czar, who
takes share in every thing that concerns his
Subjects Welfare, was wont to appear in
Person, in case of any Accident of Fire,
which frequently happens, and makes a
most terrible Havock in the City of <HI>Mus∣cow,</HI>
where most of the House are of
Wood; they look'd upon this as the most
proper Opportunity to encompass their
Design; wherefore it was concluded to set
Fire to some Houses in the night-time,
when they did not question to draw the
<PB N="37" REF="26"/>
Czar thither, and during the Confusion,
to find means to Assassinate him. The
next thing to be done was, (according to
their own Confession) to have joyn'd the
<HI>Donaick Cossacks</HI> with their Party, to have
released the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> from her Con∣finement,
recall'd Prince <HI>Wassily Galizin</HI> out
of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and surrendred the Administra∣tion
of the Govevernment into their hands,
who were also to restore the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> to
their antient Station.</P>
<P>But it pleased Heaven to touch the hearts
of two of these four Captains, that
were Engaged in this Conspiracy; their
Names were <HI>Largon Gilisarof</HI> and <HI>Gregory
Sileri,</HI> who being struck with Remorse at
the penetrating of so detestable a Fact, did
throw themselves at His Majesty's feet, in∣genuously
confessing their Crimes, and dis∣covering
their Accomplices, that very day
preceding the Night which this Tragedy was
to be acted.</P>
<P>It was on the 1st day of <HI>February,</HI> in
the year 1697, when His Majesty was in∣form'd
concerning this Conspiracy formed
against his Life, at the House of General
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> where he happened to dine that
Day, He appear'd very little mov'd at
so surprising a piece of News, but, without
any Change in his Countenance, arose from
the Table, and being followed only by a
few Persons, in whom he confided most,
he went directly to the House of the Chief
of the Conspirators, whose Name was <HI>John
Sickler,</HI> and elevated by the Czar to the
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
Dignity of a Councellour of State. When
His Majesty came to the House of this wic∣ked
Wretch, he commanded the rest to
remain without doors; He himself entred
only with three Gentlemen more, and
pretending he had occasion to ask his Ad∣vice
in some Matter of Moment, ordered
he should follow him; But no sooner was
he come into the Street but he was seiz'd,
and immediately carried to Prison, as were
likewise five more that were his Accom∣plices
in the Conspiracy; to wit, The <HI>Boyar
Alexis Sekouin, Fedor Puskin,</HI> Son of the
<HI>Boyar, Matfe Puskin,</HI> two Captains of the
<HI>Strelitzes,</HI> and a <HI>Donaick Cossack.</HI> They all
confess'd their Crimes, and being condemn∣ed
by all the <HI>Boyars,</HI> were executed on
the fifth day of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 1697,
in the Great Market-place, before the Ca∣stle.
First, their Arms and Legs were cut
off, then they had their Heads severed from
their Bodies. Their Heads were fixed on
the top of a Stone Column, erected for
that purpose, and their Arms and Legs
struck upon Iron-bars round about it; the
Trunks of their dead Carcasses were left
in the Market-place for eight days after;
till the Scent became so nauseous to the In∣habitants,
that, they were forced to be re∣mov'd
from thence.</P>
<P>It having by Confession of some of the
Conspirators been made apparent, That the
<HI>Boyar, Ivan Miloslaski</HI> was the Chief Head of
the Rebellion which hapned in the year
1682, immediately after present Czar∣ish
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
Majesty's Accession to the Crown, his Body
Was disinterr'd, which being found very
near intire, without any considerable decay
(tho' it had lain under ground near twelve
Years,) several Gibbets were erected, on
which were hung the Quarters of his Car∣cass,
which were torn to pieces in an in∣stance
by the enraged Multitude.</P>
<P>These several In-lets contrived and car∣ried
on against his Czarish Majesty's Per∣son
and Life, are so many instances, to
convince the World, how dangerous it is
for a Prince to change the antient form of
a Government, it being unquestionable,
that thereby he must needs draw upon
himself the implacable Hatred of that
Party, who arc Sufferers by that Change.
But it must also be confess'd, that no∣thing
can be more glorious for a Prince,
than to promote the publick Welfare, at
the peril of his own Life; which may
without the least Contradiction to truth,
be applyed to the present Czar <HI>Peter A∣lexiovitz,</HI>
who had no other Aim in re∣moving
the antient establish'd Guards of
the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> from their Station, than
the publick Tranquility; knowing this
arrogant and violent body of Troops, to
have been the Source of the many Re∣volts
and Troubles, that have harassed the
<HI>Russian</HI> Empire in our Age.</P>
<P>His Majesty was graciously pleased to
pardon such of the Conspirators, as were
not so deeply engaged in the Design a∣gainst
his Life, being now resolved to
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
begin his Journey into <HI>Germany,</HI> with all
imaginable Expedition. It is to be taken
Notice of, That this Prince had for a
considerable time before premeditated this
Journey, but had only suspended his Re∣solution
till he saw the Success of the
Siege of <HI>Asoph,</HI> not questioning but that
he should then be for some time upon
the defensive, till the beforemention∣ed
Fortifications, and other Works,
which he had projected, could be brought
to perfection.</P>
<P>He was sufficiently sentible, That, con∣sidering,
the present State of his Empire
was founded, upon the service of his fo∣reign
Officers, and a good Naval strength,
whereby he might appear formidable in
the black Sea, nothing could conduce
more towards the prompting and impro∣ving
so great a Design, than, if he should
go hi person to visit some of the Courts
of <HI>Europe,</HI> and especially to make some
considerable stay in <HI>Holland.</HI> But, as
if was absolutely necessary to appear with
a most splendid Equipage and Atten∣dance,
besitting the Greatness of so Po∣tent
a Prince, if he would be acknowledg∣ed
in these Parts through which he was
to pass for the Grand Czar of <HI>Muscovy;</HI>
and as he wisely foresaw that his Rank
would not be a great Obstacle to his
Design, which was to see and penetrate
by degrees in such Matters, as he was
desirous to be informed of himself, so
he judged it most convenient for his
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
present Purpose, to go in the Quality of
a private Gentleman, under the prote∣ction
of that most solemn Embassy, which
he then resolved to send, and has since
appear'd with so much splendor in se∣veral
Courts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Pursuant to this Resolution, he appoint∣ed
for his Ambassadours, My Lord <HI>Le
Fort,</HI> General of His Majesty's Armies,
and of the first Regiments or his Guards,
Admiral of his Fleet, and Viceroy of
<HI>Alovogorod.</HI> My Lord <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz,
Gollanin,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and My
Lord <HI>Procofet Bodgnanovitz, Wolnitzin,</HI>
Lord high Chancellor of the Empire.</P>
<P>His Majesty by giving the first Rank
in this Embassy to the General <HI>Le Fort,</HI>
gave the most ample Demonstration that
could be, in what Esteem the said Ge∣neral
was with him, in consideration of
his pass'd Great and Signal Services;
and to let the World know, what re∣compences
he was ready to bestow up∣on
all (the Foreigners) that deserved well of
him, since from a simple Captain, he was
mounted in a short time, to the highest
Dignities in the Empire, notwith∣standing
the difference of his Religion.</P>
<P>The second Ambassadour, is likewise
a person of Great Wisdom, and most ex∣cellent
parts, well versed in publick Ne∣gotiations,
having been sent twice by the
Czar as his Ambassadour Extraordinary
into <HI>China;</HI> and it was he that Concluded
the last Peace betwixt <HI>Muscovy</HI> and that
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>
Empire, He is in great Esteem with
the Grind Czar.</P>
<P>The third Ambassadour has been fre∣quently
employed with good Success in
those Transactions the <HI>Muscovites</HI> have
been engaged in with the <HI>Ottoman Port.</HI></P>
<P>The Czar, before his departure out of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> found means under a plausible
pretext, to send abroad such as lay un∣der
the least Suspicion of raising any Di∣sturbances
in his Absence. It is to be
observed, that for several years before the
Czar had sent many of his Subjects, of
all Sorts and Qualities, in whom he ob∣served
some extraordinary Qualifications,
a travelling in foreign Parts at his Char∣ges,
the better to instrust themselves in
several Arts and Sciences, and to quali∣fie
themselves for the Service of their
Country, after their return. He made
use of the self-same pretext to rid his
hands at this time, of those whom he
suspected to be against his Interest, and
inclinable to foment any ill Designs a∣gainst
him, in his Absence; For some of
them were sent abroad a travelling in
far distant Countries, before his depar∣ture,
the others who lay under more Su∣spicion
than the rest, were ordered to
follow the Embassy.</P>
<P>The Administration of the Govern∣ment
during his Majesties Absence, was
committed to the Care of the three Prin∣ces,
<HI>Loss Kerilvitz. Alariskin, Procorofskoi,</HI>
and <HI>Boris Alexiorvit Gallizin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="29"/>
The first is Uncle to His present Ma∣jesty,
being the Brother of the Empress
<HI>Dowager,</HI> his Mother. He is Chief Mi∣nister
of State.</P>
<P>The second is the Lord Treasurer of
the Empire, a person advanced in years
and much esteemed for his great Ability.</P>
<P>The third is his Majesty's Favourite,
being likewise Minister of State, besides
many other places, which arc of a great
yearly Value to him. He is a Nephew
of the unfortunate Prince <HI>Wassily Gallizin,</HI>
Chief Minister of State, but since banish∣ed
into <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty gave them most particular
Charge of the Prince his only Son, being then
scarce nine years of Age; This young
Prince is of a very vigorous Constitution,
Robust, Tall, and well Shaped, having
a great resemblance, as well in his Face
as his Natural disposition, to the Czar his
Father.</P>
<P>General <HI>Gourdon</HI> had orders to Encamp
with twenty Thousand of the best Troops
near the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> to keep a watch∣ful
eye, and to be in readiness upon a∣ny
occasion, that should offer. This Ge∣neral
is a <HI>Scotchman</HI> by Extraction, who
entred into, the Service of the Czar <HI>Alexis
Michaelovitz,</HI> his present Czarish Majesty's
Farther. He has given eminent Proofs of
his Valour and Ability upon several Oc∣casions,
which has deservedly acquired
him the Esteem both of his Czarish Ma∣jesty,
and the whole <HI>Muscovite</HI> Nation,
<PB N="44" REF="30"/>
notwithstanding he is a Roman Catho∣lick.</P>
<P>Things being thus disposed, His Maje∣sty
left the City of <HI>Muscow, Incognito,</HI>
with his Ambassadours, who were attend∣ed
by a most numerous and magnifi∣cent
Train. They took the way of <HI>Ples∣cow,</HI>
passed through the Frontiers of <HI>Li∣vonia,
Courland</HI> and <HI>Samegitia,</HI> and so ar∣rived
safely at <HI>Coningsbergh,</HI> the Capital
City of the <HI>Ducal Prussta,</HI> where they were
received with a great deal of Splendor
by his Electoral Highness of <HI>Brandenbyrgh.</HI>
In this City, his Czarish Majesty receiv'd
the Post-news, by a Messenger sent
for that purpose, That the Elector of
<HI>Saxony</HI> was elected King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and,
that the Cardinal Primat, had protested
against the said Election, under pretext,
That die Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was legally
chosen. Upon which, immediate orders
were dispatched to the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Ambas∣sadour,
then residing in <HI>Poland,</HI> to main∣tain
the Rights of Election made to the
Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and to assure him, in
behalf of his Czarish Majesty, That he had
sixty thousand Men in readiness, at his
Service, in order to maintain his just Pre∣tensions
to the Crown of <HI>Poland;</HI> and, That
orders were already sent into <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
for the Troops to advance from <HI>Smolen∣sko,</HI>
towards the Frontiers of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> to re∣tain
that Great Dutchy in his <HI>Polish</HI> Ma∣jesty's
Devotion. It is without all que∣stion,
the fear of so Powerful an Assistance,
<PB N="45" REF="30"/>
had no small Influence over many of the
<HI>Poles,</HI> in the contrary Interest; it being
most evident, that when the Prince of
<HI>Conti</HI> appear'd in person near <HI>Dantzick,</HI>
those of <HI>Prussia,</HI> though not averse to
that Prince's Interest, durst not declare
for him.</P>
<P>After some stay at <HI>Coningsbergh,</HI> his
Czarish Majesty continued his Journey
towards <HI>Berlix,</HI> the Ordinary Residence
of his Electoral Highness of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI>
where he was received with all the pos∣sible
demonstrations of Honour and E∣steem
due to a Prince of so Eminent a
Rank. It is most certain, That the Grand
Czar was so well satisfied with his Re∣ception
here, and with the Great Quali∣fications
he discovered in his present
Electoral Highness, That he has declared
several times since, that as soon as the
young Prince his Son should be fit to
Travel, he would send him to the Court,
of <HI>Berlix,</HI> to tarry there for some con∣siderable
Time.</P>
<P>No sooner had their High and Migh∣tinesses,
the States General of the United
Provinces received advice, that this so∣lemn
Embassy was on their way towards
their Frontiers, but they sent some De∣puties,
who were to receive their Ex∣cellencies
in the name of the States Ge∣neral
upon the Frontiers; and orders
were given not only to defray them at the
Charge of the State, but to welcome
them with considerable Presents, and by
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>
the discharge of the great Cannon of all
the great Towns through which they pas∣sed;
their High and Mightinesses being
willing upon so extaordinary an Occasion,
to eternalize the Memory of the Honour,
they were going to receive by so solemn
an Embassy, the most glorious that ever
was seen; in respect of Personal Apppear∣ance
of so great a Monarch, with whom
they were Engaged in a most strict Tye
of Friendship and Commerce. After
they had travelled some Leagues in the
Territories of the United Provinces, his
Czarish Majesty left the Embassy, that
he might with the more speed reach
the City of <HI>Amsteldam;</HI> and that by tra∣velling
thus in Disguise, he might with
the more freedom, and unperceived, take
a view of every thing he thought worth
his Curiosity. Accordingly he came to
<HI>Amsteldam,</HI> accompanied only by two or
three Gentlemen, so disguised, as not to
be known by any body, where he lodg∣ed,
at a Common-Inn for one night on∣ly,
The next day he went to <HI>Sordam,</HI> a
large Town on the opposite side of the
River of <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> and about two Leagues
distant, this place being most famous
for the great number of Ship-Wrights
and others, who are there employed con∣tinually
in building of Ships.</P>
<P>His Majesty immediately after his ar∣rival
there, took up with a private lodg∣ings
at a <HI>Burgher</HI>'s House, which lay much
out of the way, his aim being to keep him∣self
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>
from being discovered, as much as
Possible could be. His Chief and first em∣polyment
in this place, was to inform
himself in person from the Work-mens
own Mouths, and to be an Eye-witness
in what manner they built their Ships;
He bought a small Yacht of about twen∣ty
five or thirty Foot long, which he
took a particular Pleasure to steer
himself, and to Sail in the Company on∣ly
of those three Gentlemen, that at∣tended
him up and down the River of
<HI>Amsteldam</HI> (called the <HI>Tey</HI>) where his grea∣test
delight was, to make his own Ob∣servations,
and to feed his eyes with that
most beautiful Prospect of that vast num∣ber
of Ships, which not unlike a Forrest,
lie close together in the Road of that
City.</P>
<P>But it was not many days before he
was robbed of the Satisfaction of passing
away his time thus undiscovered. For a
certain Lock-Smith, who had lived a few
years before in the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> hap∣pening
to take particular. Notice of
him one day, as he passed by, knew him
first; and having told some of his Com∣rades,
the inhabitant flock'd in such Num∣bers
about him, when he appear'd a∣broad,
that being tired with the Crowd,
he resolved to leave <HI>Sordam,</HI> sooner than
he intended at first.</P>
<P>This News being come to Ears of
the Merchants of <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> Trading to
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> some of whom had the Honour
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>
to know His Majesty, they immediately
went in a Body to pay him all imagi∣nable
Respest, and to pray him to ho∣nour
them with his Presence in the City
of <HI>Amsteldam;</HI> where he arrived from <HI>Sor∣dam</HI>
some days before the Ambassadours,
who had received Orders to tarry for some
time there, before they went to the <HI>Hague,</HI>
in order to be Admitted to the publick
Audience of Their High and Mightinesses.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Magistrates of
<HI>Amsteldam</HI> took effectual Care to provide
every thing for the Magnificent Reception
of the said Embassy, great store of Can∣non
being planted upon the Bastions, facing
the River <HI>Amstell,</HI> which way the Ambas∣sadours
were to come. All the young
Men of the City mounted on Horseback,
with very splendid Equipages and those
of the best Rank and Quality, went to
meet him in their Coaches. The Ma∣gistrates
deputed some of their Members
to Compliment Their Excellencies at
their Landing, which was about a quarter
of a League without the City, whither
they were conducted in the Yatchs of the
State, and received with a Discharge of
all the Cannon round the Ramparts.</P>
<P>The three Ambassadours wire conduct∣ed
by the Deputies into the Coach of one
of the Chief Magistrates of the City; the
Deputies took their Places in the second,
and the rest of the Coaches were taken up
by the Gentlemen of the Embassy, among
whom, as it was reported, was His Czar∣ish
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>
Majesty. But first of all, rid the be∣forementioned
Gentlemen on Horseback,
who leading the Van, were followed by
the Trumpets of the State, and these by
some <HI>Tartars,</HI> Armed with Bows, and
some <HI>Muscovites</HI> on Horseback. After these
marched on foot twenty Pages belonging
to Their Excellencies the Ambassadours,
very richly Clad, their Coats being of
Scarlet Cloth, covered all over with very
rich Gold and Silver Galloons. These
went immediately before the Coach, where∣in
sat the three Ambassadours, Guarded
on each side by twelve Tall and lusty
Fellows, Cloath'd in a <HI>Slavonian</HI> Dress, car∣rying
each a Silver Ax in their hands, and
Cimmetars with Silver Hilts on their Sides.
They had red Cloaks over their <HI>Cassacques,</HI>
trimm'd on both sides with large Silver
Buttons, and large Plated Loops; all which
together, made a very Glorious and Mag∣nificent
Show. These Coaches were fol∣lowed
by a great many Footmen, like∣wise
clad in red Scarlet Cloath, trim∣med
with Silver Galloons. His Excellen∣cy
the General <HI>Le Fort,</HI> appeared that day
in an <HI>Europian</HI> Habit, and the other two
Ambassadours, in a Muscovite Dress, but
their Apparel was extreamly Rich. Thus
they passed in very good order through
the Chiefest Streets of <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> to the
Lodgings prepared for them, where stood
a Company of City Trained-bands in
Arms, to render their Reception the more
Magnificent; All the Streets through which
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
they passed, were crowded with an in∣finite
number of People, who were flock'd
to the City to be Spectators of the most
solemn Entrance that had been seen there
for many years before; and for several
days after, their Excellencies were trea∣ted
with all the magnificence imagina∣ble,
at the Charge of the City of
<HI>Amsteldam;</HI> all which, though it amount∣ed
to a considerable Summ, nevertheless
the Magistrates being willing upon this
Occasion to give the most ample
Demonstrations that possible could be, of
their Esteem and Respect for His Czarish
Majesty's person, caused a great Fire-Work
to be prepared, representing a Triumph∣al-Arch,
in Honour of his Majesty.</P>
<P>It was erected upon the River <HI>Am∣stel</HI>
(which had communicated, its Name
to the Famous City of <HI>Amsteldam</HI>) in a
place where it might be seen at a great di∣stance,
being of great height, and having
four Fronts alike to the four principal Cor∣ners
of the World; the whole Fabrick being
of the <HI>Corinthian Order,</HI> adorned with the
Arms of His Czarish Majesty, with Tritons,
Vessels, and many other Embellish∣ments.
The whole Machine was built
upon many Flat-bottom'd Vessels, join'd
close together, which being covered
all over with a Linnen Painted Cloth, the
bottom upon which the Fabrick was found∣ed,
represented at a distance, a small Island.</P>
<P>This Fire-work being too remote from
their Excellencies Lodgings, to be seen
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>
there in its full Perfection, the Magi∣strates
intreated them to go with them
to a noted Tavern of <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> called
the <HI>Doclan,</HI> where they had the advan∣tage
of being Spectators of the Success
of the Fire-works, to their entire Satisfa∣ction,
and were regaled with a most
magnificent Collation. His Majesty being
graciously pleased to appear in person at
this Feast; it was then the first time,
that I had the opportunity of taking a
full view of him, as well as others, at
leisure. He is a very Tall and Lusty
Person, Well set, with very good Features
in his Face, and, though there is a great
deal Vivacity in his Eyes, (which are
Black and Sprightly) as well as Activity
in his whole Air, he has certain Marks
of a Sweet Disposition in his Physiogno∣my.
He is very affable in Conversation,
giving frequent opportunities to be enter∣tained
with any thing that is Curious.</P>
<P>Some Hours after it was Dark, the
Fire-works began to Play, with extraor∣dinary
Success, to the Admiration of all
the Spectators in General, and His Czar∣ish
Majesty in partiulcar, who could not
sufficicntly speak praise in of it, and de∣clare
publickly the Satisfaction he had
taken in the whole Entertainment. The
Concourse of People was so. great at this
publick Rejoycing, that by the Throng,
some of the Iron Rails of the Bridge of
the <HI>Amstel</HI> being broke down, a great
many of those upon the Bridge, fell into
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>
to the River, some of whom were drown∣ed,
the rest narrowly escaping with Life,
by the help of some Boats that were near at
hand.</P>
<P>But the Deputies of the Admiralty of
<HI>Amsteldam,</HI> bring sensible that they could
give no greater satisfaction to the <HI>Czar,</HI>
than in what related to the knowledge of
Naval Affairs, took effectual care to shew
his Majesty all their Store-Houses, belong∣ing
to the Building and Equipping of their
Men of War.</P>
<P>I have it from good Hands, that these
Gentlemen who were deputed to attend
him thither, were extremely surprised to
see him with so much eagerness enquire
after every thing, that had the least rela∣tion
to these Affairs, and with how much
Skill and Judgment he would talk and argue
concerning these Matters, into which (as
they were perswaded before) he had but a
slender Insight.</P>
<P>Some Days after, his Majesty took a Pro∣gress
to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where he had an Inter∣view
with his <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty; this being
the first time these two Great Princes, E∣minent
for their Virtue and Bravery, met.
They Discoursed for several Hours toge∣ther,
and parted from one another with all
the marks of a mutual high Esteem.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors stay'd near two Months
at <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> before they went to the
<HI>Hague,</HI> in order to their Audience: For
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty being resolv'd that they
should make their Appearance there with
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
all the Splendor imaginable, Order'd that
the Number of their Domesticks should
be considerably augmented, that they
should be all new Cloathed, and Richer
than before. They had also an addition
to their Equipage three of the richest Coach∣es
that could be made, with so many Sets
of very fine Horses.</P>
<P>Every thing being got ready for their
Departure to the <HI>Hague,</HI> they set out on
their Journey, carrying along with them
good store of Sables and other rich Furs,
to be Presented to their High and Mighti∣nesses
from the <HI>Czar</HI> their Master, pur∣suant
to the Custom of most Eastern Na∣tions.</P>
<P>Their Excellencies were receiv'd at the
<HI>Hague,</HI> with all the marks of Honour and
Respect due to their High Character, and
the Day for their publick Audience being
appointed, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty followed
in Person in Disguise, wearing a plain
blew Coat, a large white Perriwig, and
white Feather; and being perfectly well
acquainted both with the Person, and ex∣traordinary
Merits of the Sieur <HI>Witsen</HI> (who
is this Year Burgo-Master of <HI>Amsteldam</HI>)
he borrowed his Coach, and desired him to
accompany him thither, Which was per∣formed
with so much dexterity and secrecy
by the said Sieur <HI>de Witsen,</HI> that his Ma∣jesty
was not discover'd by any body li∣ving.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="35"/>
It was in the Month of <HI>September</HI> of the
last Year, when there was the greatest
show of Forreign Ambassadors, that ever
was seen at the <HI>Hague,</HI> occasion'd by the
Negotiation of Peace at <HI>Reswick,</HI> whither
most Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> had sent their Pleni∣potentiaries,
who all striving to outview
one another in Magnificence, it was no
easie matter to add any thing to the Splen∣dor
of their Equipages: Yet his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty being sensible that the Eyes of the
World, would in a most peculiar manner
be fixed upon his Embassy; and being in∣vited
by a most commendable Emulation;
to maintain upon this, as well as all other
occasions the Glory and Lustre of his Emi∣nent
Station in the World, as claiming the
Title of an Emperor, and bearing the Im∣perial
Arms, he was fully resolv'd that
this most Solemn Embassy, honour'd by his
Presence, should bear the marks of, and be
answerable to his Grandeur.</P>
<P>In effect, according to the Testimony of
all that were Spectators of this Solemn Au∣dience,
every thing was manag'd with so
much Order, Majesty and Gravity, and
with so much Magnificence, that nothing
could be added to the Lustre of this Solem∣nity,
which in all Respects was suitable to
his Majesty's Design and Grandeur.</P>
<P>It is confess'd by all hands, that never
any Ambassador appear'd in a more Splen∣did
Attire, than the General <HI>le Fort,</HI> the
first Ambassador did that Day; he was
Clad after the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Fashion, in a long
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>
Robe of Cloth of Gold, Lin'd with the
most precious Sables that ever were seen.
This Robe, as well as the Vest which he
wore under it, was cover'd before with Di∣amonds
of an inestimable Value, and upon
his Bonnet there appear'd a large Jewel of
Diamonds in the shape of a Herns Feather,
with such lustre as dazled the Eyes of the
Beholders: He harangued their High and
Mightinesses id the <HI>Russian</HI> Tongue, with
an Air altogether Majestick, suitable to the
Character he bore upon so Solemn an Occa∣sion.
The two other Ambassadors, who
appear'd likewise in very Rich Apparel,
made also their Compliments to their High
and Mightinesses with a Majestick Gravity:
But that which added the greatest Lustre to
this Audience, was, that all the Ambassa∣dors
of most Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> honour'd
these Men with their Presence, and his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had the satisfaction to be
an Eye Witness of all what passed, from a
Closet which had a Window opening into
the Audience Room, without being per∣ceived
by any body, and returned the next
day privately to <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> extreamly
well pleased with his Journey. Neither did
their Excellencies make any long stay at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> they having no other Matters to
propose to the States, but the confirmation
of former Treaties.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands, that the prin∣cipal
Motive of this <HI>Embassy</HI> was, that un∣der
the specious Pretence of this Publick
Solemnity, the <HI>Czar</HI> might with the more
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>
conveniency pass <HI>Incognito,</HI> through such
Places as he intended to visit; his particu∣lar
aim in respect to his Journey into <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
being to have the opportunity of
being undiscover'd at <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> to take,
with the more conveniency a full view of
such Matters as related to Maritime Affairs,
and without any disturbance, to take Peo∣ple
fit for the Sea-Service into his Pay, and
at the same time to supply himself with
such Necessaries, as was requisite for the
carrying on his Grand Design.</P>
<P>This sufficiently appear'd after his return
from the <HI>Hague,</HI> by his Request to the
Magistrates of <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> to wit, to chuse
private Lodgings for himself, and a few
Gentlemen of his Retinue at one end of
the City. It must be confess'd the Lodg∣ings
were but very indifferent, in respect of
the Quality of the Person that was to Inha∣bit
them; but in regard of their Situation,
they were in all Points agreeable to his
Majesty's Intention, they being just adjoyn∣ing
to the <HI>East-India</HI> House, which lying
near a convenient Road for Ships, there
was the most agreeable prospect that could
be to the Water-side, of all what passed to
or from <HI>Amsteldam.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner hail his Majesty taken posses∣sion
of these small Lodgings, but he ap∣plied
all his Thoughts to the knowledge of
two Things: The first was to be Instructed
in all Particulars; which had any relation
to the Building and Equipping of Ships:
The second, to learn the manner of Bom∣barding
<PB N="57" REF="36"/>
Places by Sea, which being a thing
he was desirous to be inform'd of, he spar'd
no pains to attain to. But as his Genius
was always bent to the Mathematicks, and
as he had been Instructed most particularly
in the Mechanick part of it, which contains
the Fundamental Principles of both: It was
yet long before he made himself Master of
these Mysterious Arts; especially, since his
desire was such, as not to rest satisfy'd
with being a looker on, but would lay him∣self
a hand to the Work sometimes, with a
great deal of Pleasure, and finish a piece
with his own Hands, which he did with so
much dexterity, that one would have
swore he had been accustomed long ago, to
handle the Axe and the Hammer. I have
my self seen two pieces of his own Handy-Work;
one was a small Frigat of three or
four Foot long, the other a little Wind-Mill.</P>
<P>What else can be gathered from all this,
but that his Conduct in relation to these
Matters, is founded upon most profound
Reasons of State? It seems evident to me,
that the sole motive of it, is the Glory
and Greatness of the <HI>Russian</HI> Monarchy;
and that by the eagerness he shews upon
this occasion, of advancing the Naval
Strength of his Empire, he intends to give
the most evident demonstratons he is able,
(to his Nobility and People) that on its due
Establishment, depends the chief Welfare
of the Realm; and that by divesting him∣self
thus of his Royal Dignity for a time,
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
and applying himself in Person to the Build∣ing
of Ships, he intends to serve for an
Example to invite them to follow his Foot∣steps.
He is too sensible that the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
are naturally inclin'd to Pride and
Laziness, and he look'd upon it as the best
means to correct those Vices in them, and
hinder their further progress among them,
if he by his own Example did encourage
them to Labour and Industry.</P>
<P>At his spare Hours, his greatest delight
used
to be, to take a view Of any thing that
was curious, or worth his observation in
private Persons Houses, where he lay'd hold
of all opportunities, to enter into a fami∣liar
Discourse with them, in so obliging a
manner, that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who are ex∣treamly
taken with familiar Conversation,
were charm'd with his franck Behaviour;
which had this effect upon them, that it is
almost incredible, how many voluntarily
offer'd themselves to serve him; I having
been an Eye-witness my self, that a great
number of able and well deserving Persons
could Hot be admitted into the Service, be∣cause
the intended Levies were compleated
in much less time than was expected.</P>
<P>Not long after the Ambassadors return
from the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Majesty receiv'd an
Express from <HI>Muscovy,</HI> with the agreeable
News of a Battle, fought betwixt the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
under the Command of the Prince
<HI>Schein;</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> near <HI>Asoph.</HI> The
<HI>Cham</HI> of the <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI> had in the be∣ginning
of the Spring, caused a great num∣ber
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
of <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> to pass in many small
Bodies, and at different times thro' <HI>Caffa,</HI>
in order to join them with the <HI>Tartars</HI> of
<HI>Circassia;</HI> and especially those Inhabiting
near the River <HI>Cubance.</HI> Knowing that the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Army was divided into Vseveral
Bodies, the better to cover the Workmen,
that were employed in several Places, in
compleating the before-mentioned Fortifi∣cations,
he look'd upon this as a fit oppor∣tunity
to surprise them unawares: For
which purpose, he order'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> Com∣manded
by <HI>Sultan Galga,</HI> to advance with
great and speedy Marches toward the Ene∣my.
But the <HI>Muscovite</HI> General <HI>Schein,</HI> ha∣ving
received Intelligence of their approach,
had just so much leisure given him, as to
draw together his Troops in an advan∣tageous
place, where he resolv'd to engage
the Enemy. These perceiving themselves
superiour in number to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and
being encourag'd by that pretended fear
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army, which did not
move from their Post, fell with great fury
upon them, and were received with great
bravery by the <HI>Russians,</HI> who were con∣tented
to defend themselves in their Post,
till their General perceiving the first heat
of the <HI>Tartars</HI> spent, attack'd them very
briskly, put them first into Confusion, and
soon after to the Rout, with a great
Slaughter on the Enemies side, whom they
pursued to the River <HI>Hagalinek,</HI> where ma∣ny
of them were drowned: This River
runs through <HI>Circassia,</HI> about two Leagues
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>
distant from <HI>Asoph.</HI> Our Maps put this Ri∣ver
to the North on the other side of the
River <HI>Don,</HI> above thirty Leagues from
<HI>Asoph</HI></P>
<P>Their Excellencies the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Am∣bassadors
made publick Rejoycings upon
this Occasion, and invited the Magistrates
and other Persons of Quality to a Magni∣ficent
Entertainment, where they were di∣verted,
with Dancing, Musick, Fireworks,
and all sorts of other Divertisement. His
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was pleas'd to appear there
in Person, and in so pleasant a Humour,
that all the Guess were extreamly satisfy'd
with his Goodness, and at parting, made all
the most sincere Protestations to his Ma∣jesty,
that they should keep in everlasting
Remembrance, the extraordinary Favour
be had been pleas'd to bestow upon them,
in honouring them with his Presence.</P>
<P>Towards the beginning of the Winter,
this Victory was Seconded by the News of
another Advantage, obtain a near the Ri∣ver
<HI>Borysthenes.</HI> For the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> in
conjunction with those of <HI>Budziack</HI> and
<HI>Oczakow</HI> having besieged <HI>Kasikermeen,</HI> had
carried on their Trenches to the very Coun∣terscarp,
and at the same time made them∣selves
Masters of the Adjacent small Isle of
<HI>Towam.</HI> But a Body of <HI>Muscovites</HI> having
joined the <HI>Cossacks</HI> inhabiting those Fren∣tiers,
came time enough to the relief of
the Place, forcing the <HI>Tartars</HI> to abandon
the Siege and the Isle, with a considerable
loss on their side. Upon which his Majesty
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
gave Orders, that the said Island should
be strengthned by some regular Fortifi∣cations.</P>
<P>The same Express brought likewise the
News, that the new Harbour about, seven
Leagues from <HI>Asoph,</HI> (of which mention
has been made before) was brought to per∣fection,
the Place being already Inhabited
by Ten Thousand <HI>Mufcovites,</HI> his Majesty
having expresly forbidden any Forreign
Nation to settle there. He gave the Name
of <HI>Setruchina Tuba</HI> to this City. In a little
time after, Advice was also brought his
Majesty, that a great number of the <HI>Circassian Tarltars</HI>
voluntarily submitted to
his Obedience; and thereupon being joined
by some <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops, they had ex∣tended
their Conquests into the <HI>Crim Tar∣tary,</HI>
to the River <HI>Mious,</HI> about five and
twenty Leagues distant from <HI>Asoph,</HI> where
the <HI>Turks</HI> formerly used to unload their
Ships bound to that Place; and that the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> were then busie in building a
strong Fort near the Mouth of that River,
thereby to make themselves Masters of,
and to command that Road.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> having now taken a resolution
to pass over into <HI>England,</HI> before his de∣parture
out of this Country, gave notice
of his Intention to his <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty,
who immediately sent some Yachts and
light Friggots to conduct him thither. He
Embark'd with an Attendance only of
Twelve or Fifteen Persons, ordering his
Ambassadors to stay behind at <HI>Amsteldam,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>
and to buy up good store of Artillery and
Ammunition: And being happily arriv'd
in <HI>England,</HI> he was received there with all
the Honour and Respect due to so Great a
Prince; His <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty offering him
for his Residence the Royal Palace, call'd
<HI>Sommerset-House,</HI> (which is very Remark∣able
for its pleasant Scituation on the River
<HI>Thames,</HI>) and a Guard to attend his Person;
but the <HI>Czar</HI> persisting in his Resolution
to pass his time in <HI>England,</HI> Incognito, he
refused to accept of the King of <HI>England's</HI>
Offers.</P>
<P>After he had received the Compliments
from his Majesty and the Royal Family,
and return'd the same to them, he spent
some time in taking a view of the Two
Houses of Parliament, and what else was
worth his Observation at Court; and then
retir'd at some distance from the City of
<HI>London.</HI> for the conveniency of the Pro∣spect
upon the River, from whence he
might observe the Workmen, that were
Employed thereabouts in the building of
Ships. He stay'd above Two Months in
<HI>England,</HI> during which time, he Employ'd
most of his spare Hours, in viewing all
what was Curious or Remarkable, espe∣cially
among the best Artists.</P>
<P>Some <HI>London</HI> Merchants having proposed
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, the Establishment
of a new Commerce of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> to be
Transported only by them into <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
and the other Countries under his Majesty's
Obedience, he sent for <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>
Gallavin,</HI> his Second Ambassador, to Treat
with them concerning this Point at <HI>London;</HI>
The Treaty was brought to a good issue, to
the satisfaction of both Parties; and it has
been computed, that the <HI>Czar's</HI> Yearly
Customs arising from that Commodity,
will amount to above a Million of <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>But what is worth our particular Obser∣vation
in this Voyage into <HI>England,</HI> and
which most of all discovers the main De∣sign
of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, is, his Progress
to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> to be a Spectator of a Sea
Engagement betwixt two <HI>English</HI> Squa∣drons,
near that Port. I had forgot to tell
you before, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did Enter∣tain
him near <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> with such ano∣ther
Mock-sight, where a great many Yachts
were drawn up in different Lines, to shew
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty the manner of En∣gaging
one another, and Retiring after
an Engagement at Sea.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having been present∣ed
by the King of <HI>England,</HI> with a very
fine Yatch, Richly Guilt, carrying Thirty
Pieces of Cannon, and one of the nimblest
for Sailing in the whole Kingdom; he
sent her to <HI>Archangle,</HI> and he himself re∣turn'd,
notwithstanding the badness of the
Season into, <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while that their Excellen∣cies
were gone back to the Hague, in Order
to take their Audience of Leave from their
High and Mightinesses, the Magistrates of
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> being sensible, that immediately
after their Return, the <HI>Czar</HI> would set for∣forward
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
on his Journey to <HI>Vienna,</HI> made
great preparations to signalize their Zeal for
His Majesty by some fresh marks of Ho∣nour:
But he no sooner had notice of their
Design, but he sent to desire them to de∣sist,
being willing to leave their City with∣out
noise, and undiscover'd, after a Thou∣sand
Testimonies of their Esteem and
Friendship to his Person, received both
from the Magistrates and other Inhabitants,
during the Six Months he had stay'd among
them.</P>
<P>He was just upon his departure, when he
was surprised by the unwelcome News,
that there had been a Mutiny near the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Muscow,</HI> among some Remainders
of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> but that General <HI>Gourdon</HI>
had soon dispersed them, and taken most
of their Ringleaders Prisoners; who as
they have thereby hasten'd the entire Ruine
of their Party, so they have brought them∣selves
to a miserable End, having received
since that time the due Rewards of their
Treachery. For a great Number of them
were Hang'd on Gibbets, and many of the
Nobility had their Heads cut off.</P>
<P>You cannot be ignorant of what has
passed since his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Departure
out of <HI>Holland;</HI> with what Honour and
Respect this Great Prince was received at
the Imperial Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> with what
extraordinary Splendour and Magnificence
his Embassy appear'd there; as likewise,
what obliged his Majesty to return on a
sudden into <HI>Muscovy.</HI> It is also sufficient∣ly
<PB N="65" REF="40"/>
known to you, that he left <HI>Procofet
Bogdanovitz Wolnizin,</HI> as his Ambassadour
and Plenipotentiary for the Negotiation of
Peace to be set on foot upon the Fron∣tiers
of <HI>Hungary,</HI> betwixt the Confederate
Princes and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port.</P>
<P>His Majesty took the way of <HI>Poland</HI> in
his Return homewards, where he had an
Interview, not far from <HI>Lembergh,</HI> with his
present <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty, who assured him,
That he was resolved to continue the
War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> unless Peace might
be obtained upon very good Conditions,
and especially by the Surrender of <HI>Ca∣minieck</HI>
to the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever the issue of this Treaty
may be, you will easily grant me, if
you will be pleased to reflect seriously
upon what I have told you before, That,
supposing the Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI> should not
be comprehended in the said Peace, he is
alone capable of waging War against the
<HI>Turks,</HI> and not without hopes of Success
on his side. For his Frontiers being so
well provided and strengthned with good
Fortifications on that side where the
<HI>Turks</HI> must attack him; he has no more
to do, than to be upon the Defensive by
Land, and in the mean while to attack them
briskly at Sea. And it is more than pro∣bable,
That this is the Grand Design of
this Prince, who seems to have taken
such sure Measures in respect to the Esta∣blishment
of his Maritime Affairs, that
there is all the Reason in the World to
<PB N="66" REF="41"/>
believe, that he will always Triumph
over the <HI>Turks</HI> at Sea, who never did any
thing Memorable in that Se'rvice; and
who according to all outward Appear∣ance,
are less in a Condition than ever
to signalize themselves upon the Watery
Element at a time, when their Empire
appears in a declining State.</P>
<P>I will leave it to your own Judg∣ment,
whether it would not shake the
very Foundation of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Monarchy,
considering its present tottering Conditi∣on,
if the <HI>Muscovites</HI> should chase the
<HI>Turks</HI> out of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and make
themselves Masters of their Ports on these
Coasts, which from the City of <HI>Caffa,</HI> as
far as to the mouth of the <HI>Borysthenes,</HI>
must thereby be exposed to the Mercy
of the <HI>Muscovites?</HI> And it is not im∣probable
that <HI>Constantinople</HI> it self might
be hardly put to it, or at least run the
Hazzard of being laid in Ashes by a
Bombardment. What would in such a
case, become of the <HI>Crim-Tartary,</HI> which
being already enclosed on all sides by a
good number of strong Fortesses, must of
necessity fall, without making one Blow,
into the hands of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> if all
Commerce and Correspondence betwixt
the <HI>Peninsula</HI> and <HI>Constantinople</HI> should be
cut off, by the <HI>Muscovites</HI> becoming Ma∣sters
of the <HI>Black-Sea;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="41"/>
Besides, it is to be considered, that as
Places are attack'd now a-days, they have
only <HI>Precop</HI> and <HI>Caffa,</HI> which are in a
Condition to make some slender Defence.</P>
<P>But, Sir, being unwilling to tire your
Patience with too long a Letter, I will
come to a Conclusion; I must only repeat
to you once more, what I have intimat∣ed
before, That it was the greatest O∣ver-sight
the <HI>Turks</HI> could be guilty of, not
to take all the imaginable Precautions a∣gainst
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> becoming Masters
of <HI>Asoph,</HI> who thereby have opened them∣selves
the way into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> over
which the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire always claim'd
the Sovereignty in a most peculiar man∣ner.
To make some Amends for so un∣pardonable
an Error, the most likely
means they have left, seems to be, to con∣clude
an everlasting Peace with the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
thereby to lull them asleep, that
they may not lay hold of this Opportuni∣ty
of rendring themselves redoubtable in
the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port might thus reap a
considerable Advantage by the Commerce
with <HI>Muscovy,</HI> by establishing certain Duties
to be paid for the passage of Ships through
the Channel leading to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in
the same manner as it is practised in
<HI>Denmark,</HI> where the King of that Name,
receives Customs of the Ships that pass
and repass the <HI>Sound,</HI> in their going to,
and coming from the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="42"/>
This appears to me the only most pro∣bable
Means, to plunge them out of that
Misfortune which they have drawn upon
themselves by their own Neglect, it being
allow'd by all that have any insight into
the present State of Affairs in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
That the present Czar <HI>Peter Alexiovitz,</HI>
has taken a firm Resolution, not to rest
satisfied, till he has opened this Passage
in order to establish a free Commerce
with foreign Nations, and to encourage
them to come into his Ports near the <HI>Pa∣lus
Meotis.</HI></P>
<P>This, Sir, is the present Condition of
the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, which was formerly
look'd upon as most barbarous, but which
now bids fair for the Priority with any in
<HI>Europe,</HI> by reason of the Encrease of its
Commerce with most Nations of the
World, by the indefatigable Vigilancy of
their present Monarch, who being scarce
28 Years of Age; what is it that may
not be expected from so Great a Prince,
if God pleases to bless him with a long
Life.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Wolga</HI> is above five hundred
Leagues (to reckon from its first Spring)
to the Canal, by which it is join'd with the
River <HI>Don,</HI> and this River, from thence
to the City of <HI>Asoph,</HI> four hundred Leagues
more, fit for Ships of good Burthen,
and from the Canal of Communication
betwixt these two noble Rivers, there is
two hundred Leagues distance to <HI>Asoph</HI>
upon a straight Line, all extream good
<PB N="69" REF="42"/>
Grounds; <HI>Asoph</HI> and <HI>Astracan</HI> being situ∣tuate
under the most happy Climate in
the World. The Western side of the
River <HI>Wolga</HI> is very well inhabited al∣ready,
and there is no great question,
but that the Conveniency of Commerce,
and Plenty of the Country, will soon
invite some of the Neighbouring vaga∣bond
<HI>Tartars</HI> to follow the footsteps of
other more civiliz'd Nations, when once
they are made sensible of the Benefit of
an Industrious and settled Life. This
is sufficiently verified by the Example of
many of the <HI>Asiatick Tartars,</HI> who have
by degrees abandoned their vagabond and
idle Life, and follow'd their Prince into
<HI>China,</HI> where they are become Wealthy
by their Traffick; the like may be said
of many of the <HI>Crim-Tartars,</HI> those of
<HI>Astracan, Siberia, Dauria,</HI> and other
parts subject to the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>If we cast our eyes upon that Part of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> whereabouts the Port of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI>
is, and consider, that not above an
Age ago these Patts were as little inhabi∣ted
as any of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> being low Grounds,
and situate under a very cold Climate;
But since the Establishment of Commerce
in this Harbour, the Country all there∣abouts
is very well stock'd with Inha∣bitants,
and many goodly Towns and
Villages.</P>
<P>In the Southern Parts of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the
Cities of <HI>Wologda, Jeresla, Rostof, Pere∣slaw,</HI>
and others owe all their Encrease of
<PB N="70" REF="43"/>
Wealth to traffick. Add to this the ad∣vantage
of Commerce betwixt the <HI>Indies,
Persia</HI> and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> by the way of the
<HI>Caspian</HI> Lake or Sea; all which Commo∣dities
may for the future be transported
by the newly projected Canal betwixt
the two Rivers <HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>Don,</HI> into all
Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> what immense Profit
and Riches must not by this means be
conveyed into <HI>Muscouy!</HI> which being al∣ready
so considerable for its vast Extent
and Advantageous Situation for Trade,
may in all probability thereby become
the most Potent and Redoubtable in the
World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A
LETTER
FROM
A Person of Quality, Residing at
VIENNA,
Concerning
The present CONDITION
OF THE
Muscovite EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the late Journey of the present
Czar <HI>Peter Alexiovitz,</HI> has been
for some time past, the surprize
of all <HI>Europe;</HI> so I thought I could not
make you a more Seasonable Return at
this time, for the Obligation you were
pleased to lay upon me some Months ago,
in communicating to me your Observati∣ons
concerning His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Stay
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> than to inform you
of what has past since his coming in∣to
this Court, and his Return into <HI>Mus∣covy;</HI>
of which I have been partly an eye∣witness,
the rest I stand indebted for the
Correspondence of my Friends, upon,
whose Integrity and Judgment, I can
fully rely.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to insist upon the
Motives which induced the Czar to En∣gage
in so Extraordinary an Undertaking,
it being agreed on all hands, that as his
Design was to build the Frame of the
present <HI>Russian</HI> Monarchy upon a much
more solid Foundation, than it was in for∣mer
times, so he judged nothing could
more conduce to obtain this Great End,
than if he should take this Opportunity,
of being inform'd in Person concerning
these Maxims, which have rendred some
of the <HI>European</HI> States, so flourishing in
our Age,</P>
<P>For, whereas the <HI>Russian</HI> Monarchs used
to make the Ignorance of their Subjects
the Main Foundation-stone of their Au∣thority;
so it is obvious to every unbyas∣sed
Person, that his present Majesty looks
upon the Improvements of all Arts and
Sciences, and the Establishment of a re∣gular
Discipline, as the Main Pillars of
the Greatness of this Monarchy.</P>
<P>It was in the Prosecution of this Grand
Design he appear'd, though <HI>Incognito,</HI> in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and after having
satisfy'd himself in those Matters which
<PB N="77" REF="45"/>
were the Chief Subject of his Curiosity,
he resolved to visit likewise the Imperial
Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he arrived with
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Embassy, towards the latter
end of <HI>June</HI> last past.</P>
<P>He had scarce been a few days in this
City, when he received Letters from <HI>A∣soph,</HI>
That part of that Garrison, to the
Number of betwixt seven and eight
Thousand Men, having receiv'd Intelli∣gence,
That the <HI>Tartars</HI> had put a great
Number of their best Horses in the cir∣cumjacent
Pastures, under the Guard of
three thousand Men, were marched out
against them, had defeated the Guard,
and brought near thirty thousand Horses
into <HI>Asoph.</HI></P>
<P>These Letters were in a few olays after
follow'd by an Express from▪ <HI>Muscovy</HI>
with an Account, That the Remainders
of the antient <HI>Muscovite</HI> Guards (whom
they call <HI>Strelitzes</HI>) had Mutiny'd, un∣der
Pretence of Want of Pay; and that
being join'd by some others, were mar∣ched
towards <HI>Muscow,</HI> the Capital City
of the whole Empire, with an Intention
to Surprize and Ransack the Place. The
<HI>Strelitzes;</HI> who formerly might be compa∣red
to the Janisaries of the <HI>Turks,</HI> had
given such frequent proofs of their Bar∣barity
and Cruelty against the Inhabitants
of this City, upon such like Occasions,
that many of them being terrified by so
unexpected a Revolt in the Czar's Ab∣sence,
left their Habitations, and a gene∣ral
<PB N="78" REF="46"/>
Consternation had seised the whole
Empire, as dreading the Effects of the
Fury of these Insolent Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Princes <HI>Loff Kerilvitz, Nariskin
Procorofskoi,</HI> and <HI>Boris Alexiovitz Gallizin,</HI>
who had the Supream Administration of
the Government during the Czar's Absence,
were not wanting in their Duty, to en∣courage
the Inhabitants both by Words,
and their own Example; and that nothing
might be wanting on their side, to reduce
this rebellious Crew to their Duty, sent
some of the Nobility, back'd by a good
number of Troops, to endeavour to ap∣pease
their Fury; but they were so far
from hearkning to the Propositions offered
them by the Deputies of the Governours,
that they fired at them, and forced them
to retire to the City.</P>
<P>Thus all fair means proving ineffectual,
General <HI>Gourdon</HI> was sent out with a good
Body of faithful Troops, Commanded for
the most part by foreign Officers, who
meeting with the Rebels, as they were
advanced within four Leagues of <HI>Muscow,</HI>
Attack'd, and totally Routed them, kil∣ling
many of them upon the Spot, and
carry the rest Prisoners to the City,
where many of them receiv'd afterwards
the due Reward of their Treachery.</P>
<P>The Czar being over-joyed at the Suc∣cess
of his Arms against these Mutineers,
resolved not only to stay for some time at
this Court, but also to continue his Jour∣ney
from hence to <HI>Vienice,</HI> before his
<PB N="79" REF="46"/>
Return into <HI>Muscovy.</HI> I have hinted to
you before, the Chief Motive which in∣duced
His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty to undertake
so long and dangerous a Journey; but
besides this, there may be alledged ano∣ther,
having a peculiar Respect to the
Imperial Courts. For the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> hav∣ing
by the Conquest of <HI>Asoph,</HI> opened
themselves a Gate into the <HI>Palus Meotis,</HI>
and consequently into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> had
all the Reason in the World to promise
themselves the entire Conquest of the
<HI>Crim-Tartary,</HI> and the <HI>Tartarian Peninsula</HI>
it self, if the War should be carried on
but for two years longer by the Confede∣rates
against the Infidels, there being no∣thing
but the Cities of <HI>Precop, Crim</HI> and
<HI>Caffa,</HI> places of no great Strength, which
could make any considerable Resistance,
and prevent them from making themselves
Masters of all the Coast from <HI>Asoph,</HI> to
the mouth of the River <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> where
they had already got firm footing, by the
Conquest of the Fortress of <HI>Kasikermeen,</HI>
in the Year 1695, and the Submission of
many of the <HI>Cossacks</HI> upon the Frontiers,
to the Czar's Obedience. His <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty, who from the beginning of his
War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> had had no less in
view than the reducing of these Places,
and making himself Master of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
had, before his departure out of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> made all the necessary Prepara∣tions
for the promoting of so Great a De∣sign.
He had not only strengthned the
<PB N="80" REF="47"/>
City of <HI>Asoph</HI> by some new Fortifications,
and erected a strong Fortress at some
small distance from thence, but had caus∣ed
a new Port to be made for the Con∣veniency
of his Navy, This Great Prince,
who perfectly understands the advantage∣ous
Situations of his Dominions for Com∣merce,
(one of the Main Pillars of the
Prosperity of the Commonwealth,) has,
ever since his Accession to the Throne,
left no stone unturn'd, to improve it to
the utmost Advantage.</P>
<P>It is to the <HI>Muscovites, Europe</HI> stands
indebted for the Discovery of the Way
by Land into <HI>China;</HI> and by the frequent
Embassy sent by the present Czar into that
Country, the Way through the <HI>Great-Tar∣tary</HI>
is as well or better known to the
<HI>Russians,</HI> than some Provinces of their
own Empire. Several goodly Cities and
Villages have been built for the Conveni∣ency
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Carevans, And a
vast Tract of Ground has been incorpora∣ted
with the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>It is incredible of what Consequences
the <HI>China</HI> Trade by Land, is to the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
who by the Help of their Sleds
drawn by <HI>Renes</HI> in the Winter-time, per∣form
this great Journey with much Ex∣pedition,
Many of the Vagabond <HI>Tartars,</HI>
incited by the Industry of the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Merchants trading in these parts, have
quitted their Solitudes, and have settled
themselves in <HI>Siberia,</HI> and some other Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> which were scarce in∣habited
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>
within these hundred years. The
Communication betwixt <HI>Muscovy</HI> and
some part of the <HI>Indies,</HI> as well as the
<HI>Persian</HI> Empire, by help of the <HI>Caspian
Sea,</HI> as it is obvious to every body
that will but cast an Eye upon the
Maps, so it is no less advantageous to
the <HI>Russians</HI> than the <HI>China</HI> Trade. The
<HI>Banajans</HI> (the most Trading People of
all the <HI>Indies</HI>) have a very considerable
Settlement in the City of <HI>Astracan</HI> (the
Boundary of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> on that
side) from whence they furnish <HI>Masco∣vy</HI>
with all the most precious Things
the <HI>Indies</HI> afford, and by the continual
passage of Merchants and others, trading
from the City of <HI>Muscow</HI> to <HI>Astracan,</HI>
and other places upon the <HI>Wolga,</HI> the
Country betwixt the <HI>Ocea</HI> and <HI>Wolga</HI>
is better stor'd with Villages and Inhabi∣tants,
than many of the most Fertile Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Czar Peter Alexiovitz</HI> was as
well before, as in his late Journey, suf∣ficiently
convinced, that all these Advan∣tages
were but imperfect in respect of
what might be hoped for, if by o∣pening
his way into the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> he
could settle a Communication with <HI>Italy,</HI>
and some other provinces of <HI>Europe,</HI>
by which means the Riches of <HI>China,</HI>
of the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> might be con∣veyed
this way, to the no small Bene∣fit
of the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="48"/>
The Conquest of <HI>Asoph</HI> had opened
him the way to attain this end without
any great difficulty, considering the
present declining State of the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Empire, and the flourishing Condition
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> if he could prevail with
his Imperial Majesty to continue the
War a few years longer against the In∣fidels.
It is agreed on all sides, That his
Imperial Majesty shew'd as much incli∣nation
towards continuing the War with
the <HI>Turks,</HI> than the Czar himself, and
would have been as forward as any of
the Confederates to second the lauda∣ble
Zeal of His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, if the
present conjuncture had not obliged him
to prefer the Interest of his Country
before his Inclinations, at a time, when
the Infidels made such considerable Of∣fers
to the Confederates for the obtain∣ing
a Truce or Peace.</P>
<P>For, besides that, by the Animosities
Reigning in <HI>Poland,</HI> that King was not in a
Condition to give any considerable diversion
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Subjects of the Hereditary
Counries of his Imperial Majesty being
exhausted by the heavy Taxes, requi∣site
for the carrying on so chargeable a
War, stood in absolute need of some
Respite to take breath, and the totter∣ing
State of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s health,
was a sufficient warning to the Imperial
Court to be upon their Guard against <HI>France,</HI>
where vast Preparations were made to back
their claim to that Crown by Force.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="48"/>
These were the true reasons that in∣duced
his Imperial Majesty to consent
some Months after, to a Truce of 25
years with the <HI>Ottoman Port,</HI> wherein
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> included; but
chose to accept of the same only for
two years, for certain Reasons of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
I shall have occasion to mention to you
anon.</P>
<P>On the 29th day of <HI>June,</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty had a private Audience from the
Emperour, and desiring to be <HI>Incognito,</HI>
he was conducted by a pair of Back-stairs,
to the Emperour's Antichamber, where he
was received by his Imperial Majesty in
Person at the door; no body was admitted
to be present at this Audience besides the
Count <HI>Wallenstein,</HI> Lord High Chamberlain,
and the Count of <HI>Dieterichstein,</HI> Master of
the Horse to the Emperour; the Czar was
accompanied up Stairs only by the General
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> his first Ambassadour, who sup∣plied
the place of an Interpreter betwixt
these two Illustrious Personages at this In∣terview.</P>
<P>After the first Complements were pass'd,
the Emperour put on his Hat, but finding
that the <HI>Czar</HI> remain'd uncovered, he al∣so
took off his Hat again, and remained
thus till the Interview, which lasted about
half an Hour, was pass'd.</P>
<P>Some-days after, the Czar took an exact
View of the Imperial Armory, Library,
and other Rarities belonging to the Impe∣rial
Pallace, and the Emperour being sen∣sible
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>
of the Czar's Inclinations towards
the Mathematicks, sent him a Present of
the choicest Mathematical Instruments that
could be found.</P>
<P>He likewise invited the Czar to a very
splendid Entertainment, which began with
a most Admirable Consort of Musick, and
after a Magnificent Collation, ended with
a certain kind of Masquerade, call'd in
<HI>Germany,</HI> a <HI>Wirthshaft,</HI> frequently to be
seen in the Courts of the <HI>German</HI> Princes,
where the Master of the Feast always re∣presents
the Person of a Host; no body
but persons of the first Rank of both Sexes
being admitted to this Diversion.</P>
<P>In this, each Masker was clad after the
Fashion of some different Nation, with a
Lady in an Habit answerable to the same
Nation, so that the most remarkable Na∣tions
of the World, being represented by
this illustrious Company, adorn'd with the
Richest Stuffs, and a prodigious quantity
of precious Stones, it afforded a most un∣usual,
but at the same time, most Mag∣nificent
and agreeable Spectacle to the
Czar.</P>
<P>To be short, this Court, to shew their
utmost Respect to so Extraordinary a
Guest, strove to out-vye all the rest which
His Majesty had visited before; There
was nothing but Jollity and Feasting to
be seen, during his Stay at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and
among others, the Count of <HI>Starenbergh,</HI>
General of the Emperour's Armies, sig∣naliz'd
himself on this Occasion, having,
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>
invited the <HI>Czar</HI> and his Ambassadours,
with all the Persons of Quality of both
Sexes, then at <HI>Vienna,</HI> to a most splendid
Feast.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> in his Turn, took the oppor∣tunity
of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Day, to Entertain the
Principal Lords and Ladies of the Court,
at the Pallace of <HI>Guntersdorff,</HI> where the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Ambassadours were lodg'd;
the Emperour solemniz'd the same by an
Artificial Fire-Work, and a fine Consort
of Musick.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of <HI>July,</HI> the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Ambassadours had their publick
Audience of His Imperial Majesty, which
was very splendid, especially in respect of
the rich Presents design'd for the Empe∣rour,
which consisted in the most precious
Ermines, and Sables, and Cloths of Gold
and Silver, born by fifty Persons, Clad all
in black Velvet. They were receiv'd at their
Entrance into the outward Court by the
Guards in Arms, and after being admitted
to the Audience of the Emperour with
the usual Ceremonies, were most splendid∣ly
Treated at Court, and reconducted
to their own Pallace.</P>
<P>It was but a few days after, when the
<HI>Czar,</HI> having taken a Resolution to go to
<HI>Venice,</HI> in order, as it was supposed, to
concert Matters with that Republick, how
best to annoy the <HI>Turks</HI> at Sea, he sent
some of his Train and Equippage before.
The <HI>Venetians</HI> were no sooner inform'd of
His Majesty's Resolution, but they appoint∣ed
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>
four Procurators of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> to re∣ceive
and attend him. They ordered the
necessary Carriages to the Frontiers, and
the Pallace of <HI>Toscari</HI> in the Arsenal, was
to be fitted up for his Receiption. But
when every body expected to hear of the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s Departure for <HI>Venice,</HI> great was
their Surprize when they understood, that
he had taken his Leave on a sudden of the
Emperour, and was return'd with only
thirty of his most Trusty Servants, (among
whom were General <HI>Le Fort,</HI> and <HI>Feder
Alexiovitz, Gallowin,</HI> his two Ambassa∣dours)
by the Way of <HI>Polond</HI> into <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
leaving <HI>Procofet Bog danovitz Wolnit∣zin,</HI>
his third Ambassadour at <HI>Vienna,</HI> as
his Plenipotentiary, to manage his Inte∣rest
at the approaching Treaty betwixt
the <HI>Confederates</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>You may easily suppose, that the whole
Court was not a little amazed at this un∣expected
Change of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s former
Resolution, every one judging of the
Matter according to his Opinion, but the
Generality attributing it to some great
Commotion in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the Truth of
which was not confirm'd to us, till some
time after.</P>
<P>I told you before, that soon after his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's arrival at <HI>Vienna,</HI> he re∣ceiv'd
the News of a Revolt among the
<HI>Strelitzes</HI> in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and of their Defeat
by General <HI>Gourdon,</HI> which made the <HI>Czar</HI>
take a Resolution to go to <HI>Venice</HI> before his
Return into <HI>Muscovy;</HI> but the event has
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>
shewn since, that they were not so entire∣ly
despersed, but that their Party appear'd
very formidable, notwithstanding their
last Rour. For by the Confession of some
of the Rebels that were put to the
Rack, they were back'd in this Enterprize
not only by the Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> the present
Czar's Sister, but also by a great many of
the Nobility, who had been disgusted at
the Czar's Severity against some of their
Kindred, and by a considerable Part of
the Army upon the Frontiers of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> with her Adhe∣rents,
taking the Advantage of the Czar's
Absence, left no stone unturn'd to insinu∣ate
into the People, that he had over-turn'd
the whole Frame of the Antient
<HI>Russian</HI> Government, by reducing the
Standing Forces of the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> to so in∣considerable
a Number, and depriving
Them of their most antient Priviledges, in
lieu of which, he had set over them a
great number of foreign Officers, who
were his absolute Favourites, and Domi∣neer'd
over the Natives at pleasure.</P>
<P>That the Chief aim of his Journey in∣to
foreign Parts, was to bring along with
him such a Number of Foreigners, as
should be able so entirely to subdue the
antient Nobility of the Empire, as to be
past all hopes of recovering their former
Priviledges and Dignity.</P>
<P>There were also some among the Cler∣gy,
who being jealous of the Czar's Fa∣vour
towards these Foreigners, that were
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
not of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, blew up the
coals, clamouring with great Zeal to their
Auditors, That their Religion was in most
imminent Danger, by the Encouragement
given to Foreigners of another Religion,
who, as they were the Instruments of o∣verturning
the antient Foundation of the
State, so they would in time prove the
utter Ruine of their Religion.</P>
<P>To this it was added, That the Czar
being at present in far distant Countries,
they could not wish for a more seasonable
Opportunity to recover their Loss, by
putting the Government into the hands of
the Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> which of Right be∣longed
to her in the Czar's Absence, and
which she had managed with so much
Dexterity during her Brother's Minority.</P>
<P>These Insinuations were so prevailing
with many, that they had brought over to
their Party, not only the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> and
other Malecontents of the Nobility, who
were ready at all times to join against the
Czar, but also some of the Head of the
Clergy, many of the Chief of the Army,
and among them the General that Com∣manded
upon the Frontiers of <HI>Lithuania,</HI>
as likewise some Lords and Courtiers of the
first Rank, who were, always look'd
upon as absolutely devoted to the Czar's
Interest.</P>
<P>Notice having been given to the Czar of
these Cabals against his Person and Go∣vernment,
when he was just upon his de∣parture
for <HI>Venice,</HI> this obliged him to
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>
alter his Resolution, being sensible
that the surest measures he could
take at such an extraordinary Juncture,
were to endeavour to divert by his Royal
Presence, the Storm that threatned the
destruction of his Government in his Ab∣sence.</P>
<P>According to this to this Resolution, he took
the nearest way through <HI>Poland,</HI> with a
few of his faithful Friends, and after a
Stay of three days at <HI>Rava</HI> near <HI>Leopold,</HI>
where he had an Interview with his <HI>Polish</HI>
Majesty about Matters of great Moment,
especially concerning the approaching
Treaty with the <HI>Turks;</HI> he continued his
Journey with so much expedition, that he
appear'd in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> when his Enemies
believ'd him to have been at <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>His so unexpected Appearance, as it
fill'd all his faithful Subjects with Joy,
so it struck such a Terrour into the Re∣bellious
Party, that being thereby bereav'd
of all hopes of Success, they, durst
not as much as make any Attempt to put
their projected Design in execution.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having in the mean
while, taken a firm Resolution, to strike
at the Root of this Rebellion, and to era∣dicate
Root and Branch this Factious
Crew of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> above two thou∣sand
of them were executed in sight of
the Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> all the rest being ba∣nished
into <HI>Siberia,</HI> and some other re∣mote
Provinces; Mary of the Nobility,
of which number were prince <HI>Colorin,</HI> and
<PB N="90" REF="52"/>
the General <HI>Romanodokowski,</HI> with several
Ladies of Quality, some Fryers, and other
Priests of the first Rank, were some Ema∣pal'd,
some broken upon the Wheel, o∣thers
buried alive.</P>
<P>I don't question but that you will look
upon these Transactions of the Czar, as
favouring of too much Severity, both in
respect of the Number and Quality of
those on whom these Rigorous Punish∣ments
were inflicted; but if you will
call to mind the reiterated Conspiracies,
carried on by this Party ever since his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Accession to the
Crown,
both against his Person and Government,
you will, I am apt to believe, be obliged
to own, that what was done upon this
Account by the Czar, was not an Effect
of his Natural Disposition, which is in no
wise inclinable to Cruelty, but must be
attributed to the present Urgency of the
Affairs of the State, which required, that
those Members, who after all the Leni∣tives
had been made use of in vain, to
allay their malignant Humours, were now
to be treated with Corrosives, and such as
were quite degenerated into an incurable
Gangrene, must be separated from the
rest, by cutting off the infected Parts.</P>
<P>You cannot be ignorant that since his
Majesty's return into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> a Truce has
been concluded with the <HI>Turks</HI> for 25
years, in respect of his Imperial Majesty
and the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> but for two
years only with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty. The
Treaty betwixt his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty and the
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>
<HI>Turkish Sultan,</HI> was sign'd under the Tents
near <HI>Carlowitz,, December</HI> the 25th, 1698,
by <HI>Procofet Bogdanovitz Wolnitzin,</HI> as
Ple∣nipotentiary
and Ambassadour Extraor∣dinary
of the Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and <HI>Me∣hemed
Rami,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Mauro Corda∣ti
de Scarlati,</HI> as Plenipotentiaries of the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, consisting in these three
fol∣lowing
Articles.</P>
<P>1. That by Vertue of this Treaty, a
Truce is concluded betwixt these two
Potent Empire for two years, to begin
from the 15th day of <HI>December,</HI> S. N.
1698. And that in the mean while, all
possible Endeavours shall be used on both
sides, to re-settle a perfect Amity and
good Understanding betwixt both Parties,
either by a firm and perpetual Peace, or
the prolongation of this Truce for a long∣er
space of Years.</P>
<P>2. That in the mean time all Acts of
Hostility under what Pretence soever, shall
be forborn, and all Animosities laid aside
betwixt both Parties.</P>
<P>3. That the <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Crim-Tartary</HI>
shall
be comprehended in this Truce, who in
the mean while, shall be obliged to pre∣vent
all Excursions on his side. And ef∣fectual
Care is to be taken on both sides,
that none of the other <HI>Tartarian Hords,</HI>
or any of the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> as well those under
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> as <HI>Ottoman</HI> Jurisdiction,
may
commit any Hostilities or Depredations,
such of the beforementioned <HI>Tartars</HI> or
<HI>Cossacks</HI> (whether <HI>Muscovites</HI> or
<HI>Turks</HI>)
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>
that shall in any wise violate or act con∣trary
to this Article, being to be exem∣plary
punished by their respective So∣vereigns.</P>
<P>I am apt to imagine, that considering
the small Space of Time concluded in
this Treaty for the Truce betwixt these two
Potent Princes, it will be look'd upon a∣mong
you, who live at so great a di∣stance,
as a Politick Contrivance of this
Court and that of <HI>Poland,</HI> to wipe off the
Blemish of deserting so Potent an Ally,
who has given so considerable a Diversion
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> during some Years of this
War; but I do not question before I come
to the Conclusion of this Letter, to make
it apparent, that as the whole was trans∣acted
by his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Orders and
good liking, so the same is founded upon
a most solid and refined Reasons of State,
on die side of the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>I told you before, That the Czar of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> having by the Conquest of the
City of <HI>Asoph,</HI> situate so near the <HI>Palus
Miotis,</HI> not only opened his Way into the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> but also to the entire Conquest
of the <HI>Crim-Tartary,</HI> and the whole <HI>Pe∣nirsula,</HI>
as far as to the <HI>Borysthenes</HI> it self,
had all the Reason in the World, to be de∣sirous
of the Continuance of the War a∣gainst
the <HI>Turks;</HI> and that this was one of
the Chief Motives of his Journey to the
Come of <HI>Venna.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="53"/>
But his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty being made suf∣ficiently
sensible, that at this juncture of
time, the Confederates, without great
Prejudice to their own Interest, could
not refuse the Advantageous Propositions
offered by the <HI>Turks,</HI> he could not pitch
upon a better Expedient than this Truce
of two years, to accomplish his Great,
Design of either making himself Master
of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> or at least to oblige
the <HI>Turks</HI> to grant his Subjects a free
Trade in their Ports, for the Conveniency
of Transporting the <HI>China, Indian, Per∣sian,</HI>
and <HI>Russian</HI> Commodities into <HI>Italy,</HI>
and other Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This will be manifest, if we make a
due comparison betwixt the present po∣sture
of Affairs, betwixt the <HI>Turks</HI> and
<HI>Muscovites</HI> on that side. For, not to
mention here the present flourishing State
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Empire, and the decli∣ning
Condition of the <HI>Turks</HI> in general,
it is most evident, that the <HI>Ottomans</HI> lie
under no small Disadvantages, in respect
of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> on that side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> by the late Conquests
upon the <HI>Borysthenes</HI> and <HI>Palus Miotis,</HI> by
the Submission of the <HI>Cossacks</HI> and <HI>Circas∣sian
Tartars,</HI> by strengthning the old, and
erecting several new Fortresses in these
Parts, have so strengthned their Frontiers
thereabouts, that they seem to be inpe∣netrable,
considering the powerful
Succours, they are able to send to the
Relief of any place that shall be attack'd
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>
by the <HI>Turks;</HI> the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Armies by
the introduction of a regular Martial
Discipline among them, and the vast
Number of well qualified foreign Officers,
who command them, being at least equal,
if, not superiour to the <HI>Turkish Janisaries</HI>
themselves, the Flower and Main strength
of their Armies, which also has been re∣duced
to a much less number, by the Mis∣fortunes
they have suffered in the last
War against the Christians.</P>
<P>It is furthermore to be considered, that
the <HI>Turks</HI> having hitherto look'd upon the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> as so inconsiderable, that the
<HI>Crim-Tartary</HI> was thought a sufficient Bul∣wark
against them, their Fortresses and
Maritime Towns, though of the greatest
Consequence to them, in respect of main∣taining
the Dominion of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
have been neglected; whereas by the Vigi∣lancy
of his present <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Frontiers are in a better State
than any of his other Dominions, by the
Addition of several regular Fortifica∣tions.</P>
<P>The Naval Strength of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> tho'
scarce worth mentioning a few years ago,
has by the indefatigable Care of the pre∣sent
Czar Peter <HI>Alexiovitz,</HI> been establish∣ed
upon so good and firm a Foundation,
that the same is incomparably superior to
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet (which has been batter'd
so often by the <HI>Venetians</HI> of late) both in
respect of number of Ships, and the good∣ness
of their Seamen and Commanders,
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>
of which last, the <HI>Czar</HI> has taken a con∣siderable
number into his Service, during
his stay in these Parts.</P>
<P>The Treaty betwixt the <HI>Christians</HI> and
<HI>Turks</HI> being chiefly built upon this Foun∣dation,
that Matters should remain among
all Parties in <HI>Statuo-quo,</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
had little prospect of obtaining thy Do∣minion
over the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> or a free Com∣merce
in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ports by a long Truce,
which would have given the <HI>Turks</HI> leisure
to recover Breath, and to strengthen their
Fortresses and Maritime Places on that
side; whereas two years cannot be judged
in any wise a proportionable time requi∣site
for to put themselves in a State of
defence against so Potent a Neighbour as
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> is at present; so
that at the expiration of these two years,
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty has all the Probability
on his side to obtain his aim, either by
the prolongation of this Truce, or force of
Arms.</P>
<P>That this is his Czarish Majesty's design,
seems sufficiently probable to me from his
vast Preparations at Sea, being informed
from very good hands, that he has at <HI>Ve∣roniza</HI>
only near fourty stout Men of War,
ready to put to Sea, most of which carry
betwixt fifty and sixty Guns besides
thirty more which are to be ready and fit
for Service against the next Spring, and
a proportionable number of Great and
small Gillies, Man'd for the most part
with foreign Mariners, very Expert in the
<PB N="96" REF="55"/>
Sea-service. What Force are the <HI>Turks</HI>
able to oppose at this time against such a
Naval Strength, when they have not been
able to cope with the <HI>Venetians</HI> at Sea in
this last War? I am not ignorant that
some of our Politicians in this Court are
of Opinion, that when, by the intended▪
Canal betwixt the two Rivers, <HI>Wolga</HI> and
<HI>Don,</HI> a Communication is made with the
<HI>Caspian-Sea,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> may with more
Conveniency extend his Conquests that
way; but considering, that the <HI>Caspian-Sea</HI>
has few good Ports, and that the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Territories are separated by
Land by vast Desarts from <HI>Persia,</HI> and
that there is a strict Correspondence be∣twixt
these two vast neighbouring Em∣pires,
founded upon the Conveniency of
their mutual Commerce, I see no great
Reason why it may not be more reasona∣bly
supposed, that, in case the <HI>Turks</HI> do
not by granting free Commerce to the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> after the expiration of this,
two Years Truce, prevent the Storm, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty should not turn his Arms,
against them, especially in the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
where every thing seems to flatter him
with hopes of Success and great Advan∣tages
on his side.</P>
<P>I am afraid I have been too tedious
in these Reflections, wherefore I would
not tire your Patience, if I had not some∣thing
to add, before I come to the Con∣clusion
of this Letter, concerning the
<HI>Grand-Tartary,</HI> and other Northern Coun∣tries,
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>
betwixt the River <HI>Oby</HI> and the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Wall; in the Description of which,
as the antient Geographers have labour'd
with such ill Success, and given us their
own Inventions for Truth; and the Mo∣dern
Historians for the most part, have
described us inaccessible Desarts in lieu of
a well inhabited Country; so, I reckon
it will not be disagreeable to you, if I give
you some Account of what I have been
able to learn concerning this Point, from
somld of the most open-hearted and most
ingenious among the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> during
the Stay of the late Great Embassy in this
Court.</P>
<P>I have told you before that the World was
beholding to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> for the dis∣covery
of the Way by Land through the
<HI>Great-Tartary</HI> into <HI>China.</HI> For the Way
by Land through <HI>India,</HI> and the Territo∣ries
of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> being found al∣most
impracticable by reason of the vast
Desarts; the Inhabitants of <HI>Siberia,</HI> after,
they had submitted to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
furnished them with sufficient Opportuni∣ty
to discover the Way into <HI>China</HI> oh that
side. For these People being encouraged
by the Advantages of vending their Sa∣ble
Martins to the <HI>Muscovites</HI> at so exces∣sive
a rate, as well as their black Fox-Skins,
scarce ever known before in those
Parts, did, to satisfie their Avarice, en∣gage
themselvs in those far distant Coun∣tries
in quest of those Creatures, by which
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>
means they were by degrees, and as it
may be said insensibly brought upon those
Roads which lead into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>After the first discovery of these Roads,
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> did leave no stone un∣turn'd,
to make themselves acquainted
with the Countries that lie betwixt them
and the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall; for which purpose
they used, under some pretence or other,
to send frequent Messengers into <HI>China,</HI>
who have taken divers Roads, and many
times making great Circumferences in
their Journeys, they by this means, in
process of Time, made all the discoveries
they could wish for. They discovered
besides the <HI>Ostiakoi, Bratskoi,</HI> and <HI>Tungo∣eses,</HI>
who have their Habitations near the
Rivers which border upon <HI>Siberia,</HI> three
different sorts of <HI>Tartars,</HI> very remarka∣ble
for the vast extent of those Coun∣tries
they are possess'd of; to wit: The
<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI>
and the <HI>Calmucks.</HI></P>
<P>The first are the same which by the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> are call'd, the <HI>Eastern-Tartars:</HI>
Their Country is of a vast extent, en∣closed
betwixt, the <HI>Eastern</HI> Seas and the
Rivers <HI>Chingala</HI> and <HI>Yamour.</HI> They were
the first that many Ages ago, entred
<HI>China,</HI> but now are Tributaries to that
Empire; which makes them much more
civiliz'd than the rest of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> by
reason of their great Commerce with the
<HI>Chineses;</HI> the Rivers of <HI>Yamour</HI> and <HI>Chin∣gala,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="56"/>
affording great store of Rubies and
Pearls, which supply the defect of their
Cattle, which is very small. They are
in their Bodies not unlike to the <HI>Crim-Tartars,</HI>
and both their Language and
Characters not unlike the <HI>Persian,</HI> but they
write like the <HI>Chineses,</HI> from the top down∣wards.
Though they are not altogether
ignorant of Guns and Gun-powder, yet
not being well inform'd of all the Ad∣vantages
belonging to them, they make
but seldom use of them, they are Go∣vern'd
by several <HI>Chans.</HI></P>
<P>To the West of these <HI>Eastern-Tartars,</HI>
are those of <HI>Mongul,</HI> inhabiting a spaci∣ous
Country, betwixt the River <HI>Yamour,
China, Turquestan,</HI> and the <HI>Calmucks,</HI> from
whom they are divided by vast Desarts.
They are Govern'd by three Princes,
who have each of them several other
<HI>Chans</HI> under their Jurisdiction. They are
call'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> the <HI>Western-Tar∣tars,</HI>
and acknowledge in some measure,
the Authority of the Czars of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
by reason of the Neighbourhood of <HI>Si∣beria,</HI>
and some other Countries there∣abouts,
Subject to the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Empire,
with whom they keep Traffick in Cattle,
of which they have a great Plenty, this
Country being very full of Rivers, good
Meadows and Pastorages. They are un∣acquainted
with the use of Fire-Arms,
and inhabit neither Towns nor Villages.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="57"/>
The <HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> possess that vast
Tract of Land, which lies betwixt these
<HI>Mongal Tartars</HI> and the <HI>River Wolga,</HI> as
far as to the Desarts of <HI>Astracan;</HI> they
are divided into many <HI>Hordes,</HI> each under
the Command of a particular <HI>Chan,</HI> yet
they acknowledge one Principal <HI>Chan,</HI>
who deduces his Pedigree from the Great
<HI>Tamerlan,</HI> and keeps a very Noble Court
after the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Manner; They have
no fixed Habitations no more than the
<HI>Monguls,</HI> but live in Tents very Commo∣diously
contrived As they never, stay
long in a place, so they are the quickest
in the World at Encamping and Decam∣ping,
which is the reason the Czars of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> seek for their Alliance, by cer∣tain
yearly Presents; and these are very
ready to keep a good Correspondence with
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> for the Conveniency of
vending their Horses and Slaves, which
they take from the other Neighbouring
<HI>Tartars.</HI> They are all inclining to an O∣live
colour, their Eyes small but spark∣ling,
their Noses short and somewhat
flat. Their Habits are for the most part
the same, being distinguished only from
one another, by a Tuft of Silk upon their
round Bonnets, according to the colour
of the <HI>Horde</HI> to, whom they belong.
They wear only Sheep-Skins, sew'd to∣gether
in the nature of Vests, with a Cord
round their Waste, whereon they fasten
their Bows and Quivers.</P>

You may easily imagine, that when the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> had once opened their Passage
into those Parts, it was no difficult Task
for them, to subdue those inhabiting near
their Frontiers by force of Arms, and by
the Terror of their Strength, to settle a
fair Correspondence with the rest; so
that following first the Tracts of the Rivers
<HI>Oby, Schelinga, Genessai</HI> and <HI>Yamour,</HI> they
built several Fortresses upon the said Ri∣vers,
both to secure their Conquests, and for
the more convenient Passage of their <HI>Ca∣ravans</HI>
to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The last Fortress, which the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
built upon the River <HI>Yumour,</HI> is called
<HI>Albazin,</HI> which, as it is not above a Months
Journey from <HI>Peking,</HI> the Capital of the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Empire, so it prov'd the occasion
of the late War betwixt the <HI>Chineses</HI> and
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> which was carried on for some
time with equal Vigour on both sides, till
at last, the present Czar <HI>Peter Alexiovitz,</HI>
being made sensible by Experience of the
great Inconveniences that attended this
War on his side, in reference to the vast
distance of Frontiers, which are five
or six Months March from the City of
<HI>Muscow;</HI> whereas on the other hand, the
<HI>Chineses</HI> send their Supplies with much
more Ease, and infinite less Charge, by
reason of the nearness of the <HI>Eastern-Tar∣tars,</HI>
their Subjects; and the <HI>Czar</HI> having
at the same time a strong Inclination to
come to a Rupture with the <HI>Turks,</HI> at a
<PB N="102" REF="58"/>
Juncture when their Affairs were but in
an ill posture, resolved to come to an Ac∣commodation
with the <HI>Chineses,</HI></P>
<P>The first meeting of the Ambassadours
of these two Potent Empires upon the
Frontiers near <HI>Albazin,</HI> proved unsuccess∣ful,
the <HI>Chineses,</HI> according to their an∣tient
Customs; insisting upon some Cere∣monies,
that would not in any wise be
granted by the <HI>Museovites;</HI> But the se∣cond
Treaty succeeded according to wish,
the <HI>Chineses</HI> being forced to abate of their
Pride, and to Treat the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Am∣bassadours
from that time, with all the
Respect due to their Character.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> having not till very
lately applied themselves to the Sea, it is
no great wonder, if they have not neg∣lected
the Passage by Water into <HI>China,</HI>
by the Way of the Rivers <HI>Oby, Genessai,</HI>
and <HI>Yamour;</HI> and in lieu thereof, have
left nothing unattempted to open their
Passage thither by Land. 'Tis true, the
Heaps of Ice, which for the greatest part
of the Year are to be met with at the En∣trance
of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> the many Water∣falls
of the River <HI>Genessai,</HI> and the Bul∣rushes
which choak almost up the mouth
of the River <HI>Yamour,</HI> are Obstacles,
which though they might have been sur∣mounted
by industrious and expert. Sea∣men,
yet were so terrifying to the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
as to bereave them of all hopes of
Success.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="58"/>
And to confess the Truth, considering
the Method used by the <HI>Russian</HI> Merchants
and <HI>Caravans,</HI> and the good Order taken
for their convenient Passge through these
Parts, the same contribute not a little to∣wards
mitigating both the Trouble and
Charge of so long a Journey.</P>
<P>They set forward most commonly
from the City of <HI>Muscow</HI> in <HI>February,</HI>
when the Snow being well beaten, they
travel in nineteen or twenty days, as far
as <HI>Tobolskoy,</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Siberia,</HI>
eight hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles di∣stant
from the City of <HI>Muscow.</HI> If it
happens to thaw about that time (which
is very seldom) they take the conveni∣ency
of the Rivers on this and the other
side of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> by which means
they cross the Country till they come
to the <HI>Ostiakoi,</HI> the first of the <HI>Eastern-Tartars,</HI>
Subject to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy.</HI>
But if the Frost continue, they go on by
Land the same way, where they change
their Horses for <HI>Renes</HI> or <HI>Rain-deers,</HI>
which carry them with incredible swift∣ness
over the Snow and Ice to the City
of <HI>Genessai,</HI> built by the <HI>Muscovites</HI> upon
the River of the fame Name, for the con∣veniency
of their Merchants traveling
in those Parts; Here it is they take Ves∣sels
which carry them upon the Rivers
<HI>Tongusi</HI> and <HI>Augara,</HI> against the Stream,
to the Lake of <HI>Baikala.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="59"/>
From this Lake, they either take
Shipping upon the River <HI>Schelinga,</HI> as
far as to a City of the same Name,
owing likewise its foundation to the
<HI>Muscovites;</HI> or else proceed in their
Way by Land, immediately after they
have cross'd the beforementioned Lake,
through the Country of the <HI>Mongul Tar∣tars,</HI>
who readily furnish them with
Mules and Dromedaries, to the Con∣fines
of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>But for the better understanding of
this Famous Passage by Land, I will
conclude this Letter with giving you
the best Account I could get, of se∣veral
of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> here, of the
Road lately taken by several Embassy's
sent into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>They go from <HI>Muscow</HI> to the Famous
Convent of <HI>Troitza,</HI> about sixty <HI>English</HI>
Miles; from thence to the City of <HI>Peresla,</HI>
as many Miles from <HI>Troitza.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Peresla,</HI> they go to the City of <HI>Ro∣stof,</HI>
sixty Miles from the last, and so
to the City of <HI>Jeresla,</HI> near a hundred
and twenty Miles distant from thence.</P>
<P>From <HI>Jeresla,</HI> they go to the Great
City of <HI>Wologda,</HI> which lies one hundred
and eighty Miles from the last.</P>
<P>From this place, they continue their
Journey to the small City of <HI>Tottma,</HI>
upon the River <HI>Wergno Suchuno,</HI> and so
to <HI>Ʋstiuga,</HI> a considerable Place upon
the River <HI>Suchana;</HI> from thence to a
<PB N="105" REF="59"/>
small City, call'd <HI>Lolowitzgotz,</HI> upon the
River <HI>Wietzegda,</HI> which oxonerates it
self in the. River <HI>Dwina.</HI></P>
<P>About fifty Miles from thence, they
pass through a great Forrest above se∣ven
hundred Miles long; after which
they come to <HI>Kaigorod,</HI> a City upon the
Famous River <HI>Kama.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Kaigorod,</HI> they proceed to <HI>So∣lokamskoy,</HI>
a City upon the River <HI>Ʋsol∣sko,</HI>
which thereabouts discharges it self
in the River <HI>Kama.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they continue their Journey for
one hundred and twenty Miles with∣out
any considerable River, till
they come to the River <HI>Lusowa,</HI>
where they take Shipping for <HI>stzogorod,</HI>
a goodly City, near three hundred and
fifty Miles distant from1 <HI>Solokamskoy.</HI></P>
<P>From thence they go forward, to <HI>Jat,</HI>
a Town upon the River <HI>Ajat,</HI> and so
by <HI>Romoshora,</HI> upon the River <HI>Resh,</HI> to
<HI>Newagorod</HI> upon the River <HI>Newa,</HI> the
first Town of <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>From hence they pass through a fer∣tile
and well Peopled Country to the
Town of <HI>Zudna,</HI> situate upon the Ri∣ver
<HI>Nietza,</HI> to the Towns of <HI>Niginiskoy,
Irbitskoy, Kirginskoy, Subrorawa</HI> and <HI>Ja∣law,</HI>
the last of which lies upon the
River <HI>Tura,</HI> where the River <HI>Newa</HI> dis∣charges
it self into the same.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="60"/>
They continue their Journey from
hence to the Town of <HI>Krasna,</HI> to the
City of <HI>Tumeen,</HI> and so to the Town of
<HI>Makoma</HI> upon the River <HI>Pishina,</HI> where it
discharges it self into the River <HI>Tura;</HI>
from thence to the Town of <HI>Siltska,</HI> at
the confluence of the two Rivers <HI>Tura</HI>
and <HI>Tobol,</HI> the last being on the right;
which brings them to the City of <HI>To∣bolskoy,</HI>
the Capital of <HI>Siberia,</HI> situate
upon the confluence of the two Rivers,
<HI>Jotish</HI> and <HI>Tobol,</HI> the last of which has
given her its name.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tobolskoy,</HI> they continue their
Journey through the Towns of <HI>Demian</HI>
and <HI>Samurskoyam,</HI> and about two Miles
beyond the last, they meet with a Branch
of the Famous River <HI>Oby,</HI> which brings
them to the City of <HI>Surguto,</HI> and after∣wards
to the City of <HI>Narim,</HI> situate upon
the Banks of the River <HI>Oby.</HI></P>
<P>Here they quit this River, and pro∣ceed
to the River <HI>Kett,</HI> which brings them
to the Town of <HI>Kettsway.</HI></P>
<P>From hence they go to <HI>Makafskoy,</HI> and
after they have travelled for two days
and nights through a great Forrest, they
come to the City of <HI>Jeneskay,</HI> upon the
River <HI>Jeneskay,</HI> which is both very Na∣vigable,
and its Banks inhabited by the
<HI>Ostiaki.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="60"/>
After they have continued their Jour∣ney
for some time upon this River,
they leave it to the Right, and take
their way towards the River <HI>Tungunsi,</HI>
whereabouts are the Habitations of the
<HI>Tungeses;</HI> which they leave again to the
Right, and proceed in their Journey to
the City of <HI>Ilimskoy,</HI> situate on the Ri∣ver
<HI>Ilim,</HI> the Country thereabouts being
pretty well inhabited.</P>
<P>After they have travelled three days
and nights through a Forrest, they come
to the River <HI>Augara,</HI> which brings them
to the City of <HI>Irkuskoy,</HI> situate upon the
River.</P>
<P>About thirty Miles from hence is the
Lake of <HI>Baikala,</HI> where the River <HI>Au∣gara</HI>
has its first rise, being the utmost
Boundary of <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, they continue their Jour∣ney
through the Towns of <HI>Kabaria,
Belsko-Saimcko,</HI> and <HI>Ostrog-Ʋdinskoy,</HI> in
the Province of <HI>Dauria,</HI> inhabited by,
<HI>Tartars,</HI> to the City of <HI>Jerawena,</HI> situate
upon a Lake of the same name.</P>
<P>After they have pass'd this Lake, they
are forced to travel through a great
Desart, which is watered however by
the River <HI>Ʋda,</HI> and at last come to the
Lake called <HI>Schacks-Oser,</HI> about two
Miles over; then they come to the Vil∣lage
of <HI>Plothus,</HI> about a Mile from whence
the Rivers <HI>Sueta</HI> and <HI>Onna,</HI> fall into the
River <HI>Ingeda,</HI> which from thence for∣ward
<PB N="108" REF="61"/>
is called <HI>Schilka,</HI> and being aug∣mented
by the two Rivers <HI>Nertza</HI> and
<HI>Arguna,</HI> produces that Famous River,
the <HI>Yamour.</HI></P>
<P>From hence they go to the City of
<HI>Nertzinskoy,</HI> upon the River <HI>Nertza,</HI>
being the last Fortress upon these Fron∣tiers
belonging to the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>Then they travel for near three weeks
thro' Desarts, Forrests, and Boggy-grounds,
till they come to <HI>Arguna,</HI> a small City
upon a River of the same name, and
the last Place under the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Ju∣risdiction
in the Province of <HI>Dauria.</HI>
Here they meet in their way with the
Rivers <HI>Derby, Gann, Kailar,</HI> and <HI>Saduma,</HI>
all which discharge themselves into the
<HI>Arguna,</HI> till they come to the Source
of the River <HI>Jal,</HI> where they meet
with, he first Out-gards of the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
being a very fertile and well peopled
Country, inhabited by the <HI>Targutshini,</HI>
who are Pagans, Subject to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Through these they pass to a Village,
called <HI>Suttigarski,</HI> and from thence to
the City of <HI>Naun,</HI> three Miles distant
from the former. From hence they pro∣ceed
in their Journey for several days,
through another Desart destitute of any
Springs or other Water, till they come
to the River <HI>Casumur,</HI> which discharges
it self in the River <HI>Naun.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="61"/>
They pass afterwards by the Ruines
of a great many Cities, and at three
days Journey from the Famous <HI>Chinese</HI>
Wall, through a Road cut out of the
Rocks, which brings them to the City of
<HI>Karakaton.</HI></P>
<P>After they have pass'd the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall,
the first Place they meet with is the City
of <HI>Galgan;</HI> not above a Mile within the
