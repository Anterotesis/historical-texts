Corne and other riches, the Gouernour, his Lady, and their chil∣dren, women of great beawty: all which, they with foure hundreth other souldiours, and other people, they brought home and solde for slaues to their great commodity: they tooke further, a hundreth great pieces of Artillery, of which were forty of Brasse, full Cannons, and fit for battry: in these Castles they staied foure dayes, expecting the cōming
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> of the greate shippes with corne, in which time the Turks fallying out of the Citie, made a brauado vpon our people, who encountring with them, slue some fifty of their van∣gard, and so draue them to retire: the next day following they made away our two Galleons brought with corne and spoile, beside the foure hundreth slaues, which they sent home, before them, the galleies staying some halfe a day or more after them, putting out to Sea, met with the two ships loaden with corne, whom they tooke, with forty pieces of Ordinances, ten of them of brasse, and foure Can∣nons, in the shippes they had a hundreth slaues, other wealth more then corne was little in them, but the vessels were good and of good burthen: all which, with the losse but of one Caualierio, and ten souldiours, our men with great Triumphe brought home vnto our ports, to the greate glory of God, and the comfort of all Christians. Had not the hast of this bearer hindred me, I would more at large haue written vnto you of other points, as of the nature of the Gréekes discontentment, his reward from our Gouer∣nour for his seruice, who hath here a yearely pension, and hath here set downe the ende of his daies amonge vs: God increase vs in these and other of his blessings, and send vs more such good intelligence, for our comforts, and prosper vs in all such and other enterprises, to his glory.</P>

No gentle Hoste (quoth I) I will not hinder so much your good exercise, for I am sure I cannot be lodged amisse in this house.

Great reason quoth our Hoste, for they are woorshipfull, and right woorthy of all those duties.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Irst I think yée will graunt (quoth h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) that Maiestrates and Officers are the Deputies and Liuetenaunts of GOD héerin Earth, high and honorable, for that they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n very déed the hand and mouth of the Lawe, and in fewe and plain woords the speaking a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d woor∣king Law, for by them the law commandeth and forbiddeth So that their end and purpose is that God may be honored and glorified, good and godly People cherished, shor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly that peace and concord may be maintained. I graunt you all this (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) you will graunt (quoth hée) that she way and meane to woork all these things is to punish and chastice the wicked and the vngodly, and to giue as little fauour vnto sinne as is possible, that is very true also (quoth <HI>Pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce</HI>) Yée will graunt (quoth our Hoste) that the wayes and meanes to
<PB REF="11"/> punish sinnes and wickednes are diuers, according to the qua¦litie of the offence, as some by death, some by other punnish∣ment of the body greater or smaller. And that there is also a pecuniall punishment by the pursse, as by fine and ransome, and such like. I graunt you all this (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>). You will graunt me also (quoth hée) that all punishments are gréeuous vnto the sufferers therof, neither are or ought to be pleasant vnto the dooers and executors. That is very true also quoth <HI>Pierce,</HI> except they be wicked persons both the sufferer and the executor. Then quoth our Hoste, séeing all punishments are fearfull and gréeuous vnto the sufferer therof, &amp; no plea∣sure, but rather sorrowe and gréef of hart vnto the executors therof, such and so must néeds be the first causes and occasi∣on therof. That is very true quoth <HI>Pierce.</HI> You know quoth our Hoste, that the causes and occasions of punishment is sin, wickednes and misgouernment of life, for the woord of God telleth vs, that the reward of sinne is death. All that is very true quoth <HI>Pierce.</HI> Very well then quoth our Hoste, these Propositions which you haue graunted: doo suffise for the matter which I haue taken in hand to prooue, which is, that these great Fées and charges were neuer ment, nor yet are receiued or conuerted into priuat or proper vse. I pray you Neighbour quoth <HI>Pierce,</HI> let me heare how it is prooued, for I promise you faithfully for any thing I haue yet heard: your prooues are farther to fet.</P>
<P>You know quoth our Hoste, that the nature of the vn∣godly is to be quarelous and contencious, and dayly prouo∣king one an other, and also to take no wrong and do no right. That is very true quoth <HI>pierce.</HI> You know quoth our Hoste that the common weapon wherwith they wil be auēged vpon eche other is the Law, which indéed is the Magistrate, as ye haue already graunted, so that vpon the matter: hée is made the executor of their wilfunes and vengeaunce, which they will néeds doo vpon eche other, which thing you haue already confessed to be gréeuous and vnpleasant to euery good man. Therfore hath it euer béen, and yet is thought, and that very wisely and truely, that the likeliest way &amp; meane to disswade
<PB REF="11"/> their wilfulnes which no reason, looue nor feare of GOD could disswade was to make their wilfulnes as déere and as heauy vnto them as reasonably might be doon, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that they should not so lightly and for euery trifle vex and trouble both the Magistrate &amp; one an other, which effect although it failed to woork, &amp; that their madnes would not be res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rayned therby: that yet their vngodlynes might return to the profit and reléefe of others their neighbours &amp; Brethern that were better affected, &amp; so by one selfe and same mean: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngodly punished &amp; fléeced, and the godly amended &amp; inriched herby, &amp; that this was their meaning y<SUP>t</SUP> was the first assessors ther∣of: common experience teacheth vs, for in néedfull and ne∣cessary actions, as debt, detinew, and account and such like: the charges are so reasonable, as that no man would in con∣science giue lesse.</P>
<P>The reason is, for that they are actions of common right, and such as must néeds day by day arise betwéen a man and his Brother, neither doo they dishonest either of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arties which I dare not affirme vpon actions vpon cases, neither did they so iudge of them, as I verily beléeue, and therfore did they set double and treble charges thereupon, for greater is the charges in a brabble for a woord spoken: then f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r thrée hundred pound of honest debt.</P>
<P>So that the Magistrate, who for such Ale-house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions and brabbles: should otherwise neuer be at rest, except he should deny them his help, which might be slaunder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us and perillous to the whole estate.</P>
<P>The Magistrate I say of pure pittie and compassi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, was forced to set great charges vpon them, for the small fauour that he bare vnto them, &amp; vnto their first causes &amp; occasions.</P>
<P>The greatnes of all which charges not withstand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, yet doo we dayly sée how the vngodly run togither by hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s like brute beasts, and yet I dare safely say, that by the greatnes of these charges, and the terrour therof: many a brabling matter hath béen and is dayly put vp without any r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uenge sought therof, and many a one hauing pursued and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecoue∣red in his action, yet haue his charges so gallded him: that
<PB REF="12"/> he hath béen easier to deale with all his life after. And so by this meane many a wilfull body brought to knowe him self: and to honor God therby.</P>
<P>I cannot tell Neighbour <HI>Simon</HI> quoth <HI>Pierce,</HI> but I my self haue had two or thrée brabbles that haue kept me dooing these seuen yéeres, in which time I am suer I haue spent a∣booue fiftie pound, beside my charges to and fro, losse of time, and my hinderance at home. And what haue ye gotten for all this quoth our Hoste? These papers quoth he. Wel woorth fiftie points quoth our hoste. I think verily quoth our Hoste if any honest Neighbour had néeded to haue borowed ten pound therof: you would not haue it so ready to haue pleasured him withall. If I should say truely (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) I think the very same. What are you assessed vnto the poore in your Parish quoth our Hoste? A peny a wéek quoth <HI>Pierce,</HI> And think you that enough quoth our Hoste? Yea verily quoth <HI>Pierce.</HI> Loe Sir quoth our Hoste, whether commeth this vnto my saying and maintenaunce of these great Fées and charges or not? Who can deny the excellency of this in∣stitution? wherby the Couetuous and vngodly men are shot one against an other, and doo punish eche other, and wherby also so plentiful prouision is made for the godly poore at their charges, and yet no thank to them therfore, and that those things from the which they would depart vnto any Ho∣nest or godly vse or purpose, with as good will as from their eyes to be plucked out of their heads, or their tripes out of their bellyes, by this meane vndesired of their owne accord, they bring it in by handfuls, and so as it hath béen said, plen∣tiful prouision made for their godly Neighbours at their charges and yet no thank vnto them therfore.</P>
<P>Call you this a prouiding for the poore? Neighbour (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) I would I had giuen you the best horse in my Plough to make this saying true, and I sweare to you (quoth he) prooue it true: and you shall haue him yet or this day Seuen night, for that would ease my hart if I might perceiue that any godly person hath fared the better or were amended by any parte of all my great expences.

<P>I am no Schoole man, Neighbour quoth hée, but yet some reason I haue and some ex∣perience I haue séen, and some héed I haue taken thereof, wherfore if you wil giue mée leaue to answere you: you shall hear mée as probably disprooue these your allegations as you prooued them, for I shall proue all your propositions are pro∣bable and not necessary, neither doo inferre a necessary con∣clusion as you haue pretended. For the better dooing wherof: first for orders sake, I wil rehearse your propositions, reasons and arguments, wherof the first is, that the Magistrate and Officer is to be had in all honor and reuerence because hée is the Law which is moste honorable and reuerend, this I con∣fesse as an vndoubted trueth, namely for that the end aswel of the one as of the other, is that God may be honored and glo∣rified, godly People cherished, and maintaine peace and con∣cord strengthned and furthered, wherupon standeth the pros∣peritie &amp; the good estate of all Cuntries and common welths, their wayes and meanes you haue alleaged are these.</P>
<P>To punish and chastice the wicked and the vngodly, and to restraine their libertie as much as is possible. Yée haue fur¦ther alleaged that punishments are diuers, some corporall,
<PB REF="14"/> some pecuniall, and that all punishments are gréeu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us bothe vnto the sufferers, and also vnto the dooers therof, but that I wil not graunt ye without distinction.</P>
<P>Very true it is that all punishments without e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ception, are gréeuous vnto the sufferers therof, but vnto the executor therof: they are not all so, namely such as are pecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iall and the gaine therof returning vnto the executor. For although that to beat, burn, hang or whip any creature of God, name∣ly a Christian man or woman: is an odious thing &amp; wher∣in no good or Godly hart can haue pleasure: yet for aduaun∣tage sake it is often otherwise, for otherwise ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would not so many Oxen, Shéep and Calues be murthere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and so few Hogs, Dogges or Cats, their offences béeing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly their good flesh.</P>
<P>Wherfore, although that in all Godly reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our ar∣guments haue great necessitie: yet in humaine reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ex∣perience it hath but bare probabilitie and is no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re. But as if for example you wil say Women ought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shamed to be séen bibbing wine in common Tauernes, or to be séen at common lasciuious and bawdie Stage Playes: therfore they are ashamed therof.</P>
<P>This is an argument gathered from <HI>posse</HI> to <HI>est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> to wit, from should or ought to be, to is simply, and hath not any necessitie nor firmitie, and that shall you see if you will goe with me to London this next Terme.</P>

And therfore vnto their cal¦lings appoīted they great and honorable reuenues, knowing that their gain is the punishment of vice and the rewarde of Vertue, and that the part &amp; portion of all the godly is therin, knowing also that there is not so great Incouragement vn∣to Vertue and Godlynes: as the liberall rewarde therof, and that all vngodlynes and vnthankfulnes is measured by the greatnes of thy goodnes and benefit receiued either at y<SUP>e</SUP> hāds of God or man.

<PB REF="16"/> for the vertues and godlynes which he meaneth to call them vnto, and in this order beginneth to woork, I meane in be∣stowing vpon thē so liberally, and by that meanes to charge them with his expectation, in respect of their great Tallent committed vnto them, which thing you séem to alledge, as no small cause and consideration of the high assessing of the fées and charges aforesaid, and that so great mercies &amp; gra∣ces bestowed vpon them by God, and so liberall reward ap∣pointed vnto them by men: should suffise to make them god∣ly and vertuous from thence foorth: what so euer they were or had béen before. All which arguments, although they be godly and probable: yet as I said before they stand doubtful, for the olde Prouerb, Honors chaunge manners. I beléeue the godly and the learned doo dout whether it be taken in the better part, or in the wursse, for I am very sure, that many are wurse disposed, and much more vngodly in high and ho∣norable calling: then while they were in meane estate and degree.</P>
<P>Neighboure <HI>Pierce</HI> (quoth our Hoste) there is no rule so generall, that it admitteth not exception, albeit I dout not nor euer did, that honours chaunge manners, is and euer was meant in the better parte. For the wiseman saith. He that is vngodly in welth: how much more vngodly would he be in pouertie? The examples are many that doo prooue that honors chaunge men to the better, namely of <HI>Saule,</HI> of whome it is said that béeing called from a simple boy after his Inau∣guration: he felt him selfe suddainly chaunged, and as the book saith: he felt a new hart in him.</P>
<P>The like example we haue of many Kings and Prophets in the Scripture. But to come néerer, both for the time and also the place, in our English History we read of that no∣ble King H. the fifth, who in his Fathers life was of euil go∣uernment, and kept company with riotors and vnthrifts, so that there was small hope of him, but after the death of H. y<SUP>e</SUP> fourth, when this yung man was placed in his kingdom: he sent for all his olde companions, who were not a little glad therof, but when they weare come into his presence: he sharply rebuked them, and giuing them small rewards, yet

All these examples doo manifest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y prooue that liberall reward of vertue, and high and Honorable calling doo increase vertue in them in whome it is al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edy and causeth them in whom it is not saue only in appara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, yet for pure shame to imbrace it, séeing that otherwise h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t coales are heaped vpon their heads, through their shamelesse vn∣thankfulnes vnto them that haue so thorowly prouo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed them with the greatnes of their benefits.</P>
<P>And therfore against all these reasons and proof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to say that the Magistrate and Officer should priuatly C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uet and conuert so great summes of treasure: it were to shamefull and slaunderous, considered that they are the effect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of so e∣uill causes as hath already béen shewed And consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red also the horrible and wicked conclusion that would ensu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therup∣on, as also hath already béen prooued.</P>

First for that they doo not sustaine any such charge of expectation, neither is any reason that they should, except a Shoomaker bying an Oxe hide for thrée shillings &amp; foure pēce, might sel shooes for twen¦tie shillings a paire: for that would alter the case.

All this hée ac∣counteth honest gain and very wisely handled, so that when he hath any thing to let or set, vp goeth the Drum &amp; as wel∣come to him the Deuil of hel, yea Belzabub him selfe as the Godlyest person in England, yea as an Angell of heauen, for godlynes, vertue or honestie is the last question that hée wil aske, only <HI>Quid vultis mihi daré?</HI> Thus is the godly per∣son sure to be put back or els to take the thing to his vtter detriment, so that vpon the matter no question or difference whether of them spéed, for the euil man is made a great deale wursse, namely for that the greatnes of his rent stoppeth the mouth of him whose reduke hée should moste feare &amp; whome hée would and should moste reuerence and regarde, and ther∣fore wil hée be as wicked and as vngratious and corrupt as

And also that they were and yet are ment a publique treasure in the hands of the re∣ceiuers therof, to all godly vses, intents and purposes.</P>
<P>Wherunto I answered, alleadging the great purchase of Lands and Lordships by the receiuers of the same as a thing repugnant and contrary to your Assertion, wherunto you haue replied that their great purchase is not only contrary to your first Assertion: but a confirmation of the same.</P>
<P>For you say that their porchase of lands is a prouision with out comparison more assured and permanent then were or could haue béen the distribution of the money or any parte therof from hand to hand, and also that the effects and fruits therof are moe and greater and doo stretch farther and more generally and vniuersally doo procure the honor and glory of God, and the publique welth, peace and quietnes.</P>
<P>To prooue that these things are so: you haue alleadged the honorable calling of the Magistrate and Officer, and y<SUP>e</SUP> great expectation that hée sustaineth both before God and men, and also the reuerend opinion that we are bound to haue of him. Yée haue also alleadged that the first causes of all these great gaines and proffits are such as of duty he is bound to per∣secute and not to prosecute, namely for that they are vngod∣lynes, wickednes and all kinde of vice, by the gain wherof (say you) no honest nor godly person can without great shame thriue and wax rich, much lesse the Magistrate and Officer vpō whose great expectation héerin you doo so greatly insist.</P>
<P>Truely Neighbour (quoth hée) all these are goodly and al∣so godly reasons and doo very wel prooue how things either

<P>But that they are so presently: these are either n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prooues at all or very small and so your argument gathered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd con∣cluded from <HI>posse</HI> to <HI>esse</HI> as I haue said already, and as I wil further prooue by Arguments gathered from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cause vnto the effect and from the effect vnto the cause eue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ve∣ry same that you haue alleadged, tying them together in the same maner and fourme as your selfe haue alleadge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them.</P>
<P>First you say that the originall cause of these gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t gains, Fées and reuenues was the hate that the first Assess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s ther∣of bare vnto vngodlines, wickednes and all kinde of vice, the fauour and good affection which they bare vnto Vertue, and godlynes, and therin they ment the punishme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the one and the preferment and aduauncement of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, and so you conclude lewdnes, vnthriftines and vngodlynes to haue béen and yet stil to be the first cause of these great gains, Fées and reuenues, and these great Fées and reuenues their effect, the effect of these fées, profits and reuenues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ée haue alleadged or rather I my self haue alleadged, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou haue confessed and iustified to be the great perpuisition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd pur∣chase of Lordships, lands and possessions by the Magistrates and Officers Receiuers of the same.</P>
<P>The effect of their great purchase is by you ale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dged to be a prouision, a stay of liuing and patry mony for the Godly and honest People of the common welth, and for their assu∣raunce, peace and quietnes.

<P>Thus haue you argued from the first causes pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ducing their effects, and from those effects as from causes of their ef¦fects very orderly and very probablie, but not nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssarilye as I haue already alleadged, and as I doubt not héerafter

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T my béeing in London this last term (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) it fortuned one afternoone hauīg little or nothīg to doo, as God knoweth what Idle∣nes &amp; vngodlines commeth of our idle waitīg &amp; attending vpon our dayes of hearīg as they tearm them, when in the mean time we run vp and down in the stréets, and if happely wée méet with any Fréend or acquaintaunce: it is holden great humanitie to of∣fer him the curtesie of Londō, which is as much to say to haue him to the Tauern &amp; there to sit bibbing vntil neither of thē can scant finde the way foorth again.

<P>To the first point of the first declaration for forcible entry wée praied his reason, how or by what reason our entrie mi∣ght be said forcible séeing the doores were open, and if they had béen shut our cōming in was but to hear &amp; sée, &amp; our mea∣ning not hurtfull to any man. His answere therunto was that a mans meaning that commeth into my house shalbe cō∣strued and taken to haue béen such from the beginning as is his act there doon after he is entred, for y<SUP>t</SUP> shalbe taken for his meaning &amp; the declaration therof, namely where hée entreth w<SUP>t</SUP>out special commaundemēt or licēce of the party, &amp; because (saith hée) that after your entry into y<SUP>e</SUP> house yée did there cō∣mit a force &amp; vnlawful act: therfore your first entry and com∣ming into the house shalbe déemed &amp; iudged vnlawful &amp; forci∣ble.

His answere vnto that was that we are not to dispute of that which the reuerend and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>norable Magistrates haue established yea &amp; holden in no small repu∣tatiō, it falleth for y<SUP>e</SUP> Magistrates, Rulers &amp; Officers to beare with them in all incidents &amp; casualties otherwise should they dissalow their owne Acts and be contrary vnto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>selues, which were inconuenient.

<PB REF="23"/> ouer a man, woman or Childe, bothe the Cart, the Horses, and the Carter are guiltie of the fact wherof the deaf man is not excuseable neither can plead not guiltie to the fact, be∣cause hée was the first and chéef efficient cause, therupon wée mooued vnto him this question, why the Musitians them selues should not be said to be the first efficient cause séeing y<SUP>t</SUP> without their noise the Dauncer would not so haue fared nor taken on, neither the deaf man haue taken him for a madde man, as bothe you and wée would haue doon if wée had béen in his case, and had heard no more then hée heard.</P>
<P>Vnto that his answere was, that whatsoeuer it séemed vnto him or vnto vs, it is (quoth hée) at your peril, and at all mens perils els that resorte and haūt to such places to put on all our Sences, wits and vnderstandings, and also to desire God to giue them wisdome and his grace to Iudge wisely &amp; wel to digest such things as they heare and sée therin, and y<SUP>t</SUP> wée be not snared in euil through ignorant appetite of our sences vnto our hinderaunces more then wée our selues are able of our selues to Iudge or think, for (saith hée) séeing wée are not able, neither is our authoritie to blame or cha∣lenge the places, neither to disalowe the things there pro∣fessed, which were to derogate from the Magistrate.</P>
<P>Yet if wée haue so much grace of God as to the Magistrates vnto our selues and in such cases to blame and reprooue our selues, and our owne sences, and inordinate desires, either in due time before wée are fallen, or els in some reasonable time, and with our reasonable losse and hinderaunce it may suffice for answere vnto vs by them vnto whome otherwise wée must créep and pray our redresse neither able to craue it at their hands without an inconuenience aforesaid, which is condemne and disalowe the things by them selues allowed and established.</P>
<P>Wée asked him what reason there was that wée should be charged in seuerall actions and vnto seuerall persons, for one trespasse, as namely vnto the Maister and also to the ser∣uants. His answere therunto was that the Maister hath a speciall interest in his seruant for the proffit hée is to receiue by his seruice for which seruice hée is to recouer &amp; not for the
<PB REF="23"/> hurt doon vnto the person for the partie him selfe recouereth for that. To be short, his resolution was that for all our har∣mes and losse that we had gotten: wée were so farre from all hope of redresse or amends, that wée were in the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsse case in our defence against thē &amp; very like to yéeld amēd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by iudge¦ment of law. And thus you sée (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) how po re guilt∣lesse &amp; simple men in a far honester cause are put to y<SUP>e</SUP> wurser end. Neighbour <HI>Pierce</HI> (quoth our Hoast) as for y<SUP>e</SUP>, be as bée may.

<P>Nay soft (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) I haue an other matter to tel you and that almoste as straunge as this, and that chaunced to my selfe in a mischaunce about a foure yéers past, I pray yée let vs heare it quoth our Hoast, mary quoth <HI>Pierce,</HI> thus it hapned. A fréend of mine would néeds giue mée my din∣ner at an Ordinary table where wée fared very dai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tely, but I promise you for mine owne parte I haue though my self better at ease many a time &amp; oft with bread &amp; chéese in other Company. So Sir in the name of God when di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner was doon: in stéed of grace to y<SUP>e</SUP> dice they went on euery side vpon proper square tables fit I warrāt you for the purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, &amp; there to the hazard they go xx. s̄. xl. s̄. v. l. vi. l. a cast, I stood by and beheld. Anon there came a straunger a plain homely fel∣lowe
<PB REF="24"/> of the Cuntrye much like my self and hée séeing such summes of money vpon the boord, &amp; the dice trotting to and fro and that now one snatched a heap and now an other snat∣ched and heap, and therwithall such deuout swearing, he came to mée and rounding me in the eare, asked me whose weare all those heaps of money that were laid foorth, mary (quoth I) his that can get them, get them (quoth hée) how? Marry (quoth I) by hazard, say you so (quoth hée) claime they no farther propertie in their money but by hazard whether themselues shall haue their money or an other man? no veri∣ly (quoth I) What are those white things ful of black spots that are so chased to and fro? Those (quoth I) are called dice vpon whome standeth the hazard, and therwithal my Fréend and I hauing dined and dispatched: went our way foorth to∣ward the Temple, and before we had gon so farre as a man might shoot a Bird bolte: there arose an outcry behinde vs, stop the théef, stop the théef, and therwithall I looked behinde mée: and loe the fellowe of whome I tolde you, came running with both his hands ful of money and after him ran the ru∣ler of the Ordinary and thrée or foure of his seruants as fast as euer they could run with hue and cry, we turned not back neither made vs to doo therin. So they followed him vntil they came as farre as Saint Dunstones Church, and there the fellowe being out of breath, turned again and catching y<SUP>e</SUP> Maister of the dicing house in his armes: cryed I haue him I haue him, this is the théef (quoth hée) Now was the throng so great y<SUP>t</SUP> a man could not know which was which vntil at the last the Officers came and took them bothe and knowing the Maister of the dicing house: asked him what the matter was.</P>
<P>Mary (quoth hée) this Villain Théef hath robbed diuers Men of Woorship my Guests of great summes of money and I haue followed him for he fled vpon the fellony. And there hée had spied mée in the Company &amp; bad thē lay hold vpon me for this knaue (quoth he) gaue him y<SUP>e</SUP> coūcel &amp; is as false a théef as hée. There was no more to say, I was laid hold vpon &amp; ap∣prehended, and bothe hée and I caried before a Iusticer of peace the fellow and I, my fréend would not leaue mée but went with mée to sée and heare the end. So sir, when wée
<PB REF="24"/> were come before the Iusticer: hée laid sore to the Fellowes charge that hée had broken his house forciblie and burglarlie and had felloniously robbed foure Gentlemen of wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rship his Guests of diuers summes of money feloniously an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the Quéens lawes and peace. Sirra (quoth the Ius<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice) what saist thou to this? Sir quoth the fellowe I beseech y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u to stād my good Fréend and Maister and let mée haue but law &amp; rea∣son at your hands, I trust it appéereth vnto your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscretion (quoth hée) that this matter alleadged against mée <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not suf∣ficient to put me to answere therunto. First for the for∣cible entrie into his house and burglarye supposed: I say his house was open, and dayly is and to long hath béen and vnto to many if it pleased God and the Maiestrates such as your Woorship is, for I vndertake hée that hath any thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to lose and cast away: néed neither break doore nor walle t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> leaue it behinde him there, and so much for my answere vnto that part. As to the money supposed to be stolne: hée declareth no certaintie therof, neither conueieth to him self any property therin, and so no fellony of y<SUP>e</SUP> thing wherto no man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laimeth propertie, very true it is (quoth hée) that I came into his house and séeing a company standing about a square Table &amp; diuers great heaps of money laid foorth therupō: I asked this honest man that was a stander by meaning (mée) what was ment thereby, and also by two white square things full of black spots that were chased to and fro vpon the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd, hée answered mée that they were playing at the dice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r that is quoth he the name of those square bones, and said farther that the name of their game was hazard. When I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d heard him say so: I considered with my self that there mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be good to be doon for me among them, for hauing wel mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed their order: I found them the moste indifferent People t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gain by that euer I met withall in my life, for I perceiued that hée that laid the money downe: the rest meant that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should neuer take it vp again, and for his parte hée me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t aswell vnto them and that all this stood in the fauour of haz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd, and so often time it chaunced accordingly, to wit that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> box bée∣ing the third person: caught a share and by no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or better title then mée thought my self to haue, for me thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I was
<PB REF="25"/> as indifferent to euery of them as was the box or as any of them was to other, for I verily thought and yet doo that if nei¦ther of them euer fingered that laid down either had his de∣sire against other, moreouer quoth hée, when I beheld such lewd and shameful mispending of y<SUP>e</SUP> time, such horrible swea∣ring and blaspheming &amp; knew not where neither vnto whōe to complain for reformation therof and thought in conscience I ought not to suffer it as far foorth as it were in my might &amp; I saw no way so likely to redresse it as to take away y<SUP>e</SUP> cause which I perceiued was the money. I thought that both by law and good conscience I might doo it and ought also, and in this deliberation I awaighted my time &amp; snatched vp al that I could lay holde vpon and came my way, wherupon I pray your discretion and whether this be fellony wherin there is title or at y<SUP>e</SUP> least cullour of title. A Sirra quoth the Iusticer, you are acūning théef indéed, it is time to look to such knaues as you are. Sir quoth the poor fellowe, I beséech you be good to me, I am a poore man and I trust, sauing against them y<SUP>t</SUP> lost the money the money is mine against all men and as vn∣to them when they demaund me: let me answere. And as tou¦ching that honest man quoth heby me, I neuer delt with him nor neuer saw him before, to be short the Fellowe was com∣mitted to Newgate, and I was fain to finde surety by recog∣nisaunce to appéer at the next sessions there to make answere to such matter as should then and there be laid to my charge and that cost me fiue shillings and this was all that I got by hauing my dinner giuen mée.</P>
<P>And what said your Lawyer to you for this said our Hoast, what comfort dooth he giue you of a mendes against the par∣tie that thus misused you, truely (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) hée vtterly discourageth mée to stur or meddle farther therin, and all vp∣on the same reasons that hée made before or els the very like in effect.

The more Recognances for the peace and good a bearing, aswel by the Godly as by the vn∣godly, the one inuading and the other defending: the more praying, paying, waiting, attending, dowking, crowding, &amp; courtesing, procuring of fréendship by meanes, bribing of his flatterer, &amp; bribing of her flatterer, this driueth the great welth and abundance into few mens hands.

The causes that make men to sell their patrimo∣nyes and to spoyle their inheritance, who knoweth not to be these, riot, gaine, whordome, delight in all vngodly pleasures and pastime of sensualitie, shortly the not fearing of God, nor seruing him, and the not caring to knowe his wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and com∣mandements, nor to liue therafter, these are the causes. The effects are these, first the spoyle of the land and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making it barren and bare of all the commodities therof, secondly the dislodging and disapointing of the honest Farmers and good house kéepers, for their sakes that will doo more then they, without any other respect, and those are commonly the wic∣ked and vngodly, and from thence ariseth infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sutes and controuersies, maintenaunces, champerties and such like.</P>
<P>This causeth lands often to chaunge their tenaunts and
<PB REF="32"/> inhabitants, and by that means breacheth and dissolueth one of the greatest and surest bonds of looue and fréendship that is or euer was, namely, coeducation, conuersation and acquain∣taunce, which hatcheth, nourisheth and confirmeth looue and fréendship, not only betwéen men: but euen betwéen the brute and vnreasonable beasts, who hauing béene fostered long together in one place, will not only looue and defend one an other: but also euen the very place wherin they were bred and nourished, and they will very hardly be sundred or dri∣uen there from. And this is the very law of kinde, which can not effectually woork among neighbours, of whome some are dayly or yéerly flitting and giuing place vnto new, namely such as will bid more the which commonly are the wurser sorte as hath béen already alleaged. These are two effects.</P>
<P>The third is the sinceritie of Iustice and also of dicipline both which it greatly hazardeth, namely for y<SUP>e</SUP> buyers and sellers are Corelatiues, and that the one cannot be without the o∣ther, and for that also the causes of selling &amp; spoyling of pa∣trimonies are such as I haue already declared. These things are right perillous in a common welth, and yet doo almoste necessarily followe the too often and common translation of possession and inheritaunce, namely where it is by peny pur∣chase, against the which neuerthelesse it is meruelous hard to foresée and to prouide, I meane for heires and inheritours of Lordships, Lands and possessions to continue in the same, béeing things that so many desire to haue, yea oftentimes such as haue in their hands the bridle of libertie, or restraint of good and euill, and of the liues and manners of men, for what is there in all this earth so much desired as houses, lan∣des, Lordships and possessions, and to commaund ouer peo∣ple? What els is the end of all so many and great trauels, watch, studie so many and so great hazards by Sea and land, so many shifts, sleights, deceits and oppressions, of all which this world hath béen, is &amp; euer wil be full, against all which who so will holde a thing of so great value: he must be well prouided and of great defence, and hath néed to haue in him self the strength, wisdome, councell and iudgement of many,
<PB REF="32"/> and so much the rather by how much his possessio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is y<SUP>e</SUP> grea∣ter, and that for two causes. First for that in his e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rour of life fall and misgouernment: lyeth the fall, ruin and decay of a number, what of his owne blood, what of his tenaunts, faith∣full freends and seruants. Secondly for that his estate is sub∣iect vnto many enimies, of whom the greatest and moste dan∣gerous is the flatterer the olde enemie of all mankinde, as the story of our Father <HI>Adam</HI> and mother <HI>Eue</HI> and the Ser∣pent dooth well declare.

<PB REF="33"/> him to beléeue of himself any thing, causing him also to delight no while in any one thing, whether it be apparell or the fashion therof, place, person, dyet, fréend, seruant, Te∣naunt or other thing what soeuer, and this as dayly experi∣ence teacheth, is the high and ready way to y<SUP>e</SUP> Vsurers house and from thence to the Extorcioner, who dwelleth hard by, of which twaine by that time he hath taken foorth his lesson kindely: I dare be his suretie hée wil not be hasty to doo good to any good body, neither if he would shall he haue wherwith all, for either shall he haue no lands left him at all: or if he haue any, he shall be glad to let them déerer then that any ho∣nest man shall doo good thereon, so that in conclusion, both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Landlord and the tenaunt shalbe miserable.</P>
<P>The cause héerof is Pride moste and chéeftly, as I haue said, and oftentimes youth, good nature, or peraduenture excesse of Pleasure and Sensuall delights, where through yong Gentlemen are often snared through euill company, béeing ouertaken sometime by giuing their woord, sometime through a bribe of a little present mony, sometime by one de∣ceit, sometime by an other, wherin men are soone pampred, namely such as are of small experience and iudgement, and knowe not the false lures of the wicked and vngodly, aga∣inst all which these Corporations and customes are of great force and a great defence, for in both these cases: hardly can they be assaulted, much lesse inuaded by any of the enemies aforesaid.</P>
<P>First for that a corporation is neuer vnder age, as for example, Maior and Comminaltie, Deane, and Chapter, Wardens and Fellowes and such like, whose succession is by election, their proprietie is ioynt and in common, neither can one doo any thing without the rest, and therfore to flat∣ter any one of them vaine, and to flatter them all very hard namely mens Natures, Wit, Iudgements and Affections béeing diuers, and euery man willing to maintaine and pre∣fer his owne opinion or his fréends. Pride atteinteth them not, for who is proud, or at the least so proud of any thing, wherin a number hath to commaund as much as he, and
<PB REF="33"/> without whom he can doo nothing, then béeing armed against Pride the Father of necessitie and néed: they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter frée∣ly to afforde their good woord or déed, and therfore in vaine were it to bribe them.</P>
<P>But admit that any of them would be bribed, it were also in vaine and would procure the euill will of all the rest with out bribing them all which were heauy and hard to doo.</P>
<P>So that in any competicion made vnto such persons against any olde Fréend, Tenaunt, Officer or seruant: it is very hard to preuaile except it be through his owne great misbe∣hauiour. And where it is betwéen méere Sraung<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs one of them against an other, there the best and moste woorthy is sure to spéed, for certainly and infallible there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othing in all this world so amiable, so beloued and fauoured as hones∣tie, vertue and godlines are. Where priuate flatterie or briberie stand not in their light, as in the case of priuate Ow∣ners and proprietaries: I haue alleadged that it both may and often dooth. And thus much of the Corporations &amp; of their effects. Now to speake of the customes of Manours the very same or like in effect may be said, for the Inheritour of custo∣mary Land although hée be seased therof to him and to his heires yet can hée not sel it without licence of the Lord and that solemnly graunted by his Steward in open Court and there entred, nay hée cannot set or let the same or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therwise impaire the wood or other commodities therof without licēce aforesaid.</P>
<P>So great an entresse and commaundement hath the Lord therin and yet not to the hinderaunce or preiudice of y<SUP>e</SUP> Inhe∣ritaunce but <HI>e contra,</HI> namely that the selling, setting or o∣ther gouernment of such a royall possession as land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: should stand in y<SUP>e</SUP> Iudgement &amp; discretiō of diuers, &amp; those of y<SUP>e</SUP> ripest &amp; best aduised, and not to be solde, wasted or spoyled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough y<SUP>e</SUP> intemperaunce of one foolish or vngodly man or woman ei∣ther formed or necessitie or otherwise for flatery or other fōd or foolish affection whatsoeuer, wherin the Lord and his ler∣ned Stuard and the homagers of the Court are Iudges.</P>
<P>In all which case it may euidently appéer how great a care
<PB REF="34"/> those honourable and reuerend Forefathers had to enact and establish the great possessions in the hands of such as were not like to misregarde so great and high a blessing of GOD, the effects and fruites wherof haue béen many and great as from time to time proof hath verified and yet dooth, for it hath alwaies béen accoūted &amp; yet is a right happy thing to be tenāt or Farmer to a Corporation or enioy any commoditie vnder them. For woorshipful &amp; honorable haue alwaies béen their dealing in ordering and gouernment of their Lands, liuings, and possessions. and of their Tenaunts and Farmers of the same. But chéefly and abooue all others to be Tenaunt vn∣to the Prince, who indéed is a Corporation, for from the Prince, there can passe nothing but by writing vnder seale, neither dooth or can w<SUP>t</SUP>out the consent of diuers of the moste honorable and best aduised. These (quoth hée) are the cau∣ses and the reasons that haue mooued mée to make these lea∣ses, and therin these reseruations which vnto you doo séeme so very strange. For I suppose this to be a strong meane to vnite the Landlord and his tenaunt togither, and to coun∣terballaunce the one of them against the other in fourme of a corporation, or els as néer vnto the Nature therof as I could deuise. For by this meanes, if my heires or any of them chaunce at any time héerafter to proue vnthrifty: his vnthrif∣tines shall not be so gainfull vnto any man y<SUP>t</SUP> in hope to pur∣chase his lands would therfore strengthen his hands therin and by these means I haue left them moe Frends and fewer Flatterers. For hée that shal buy his lands without the con∣sent of the Farmer: hée shall for the time make as good a pur∣chase as dooth hée that purchaseth of a Woman her Husbāds lands while hée is yet aliue, or he that goeth to the Poul∣trie and buying there a Capon for two shillings putteth him into his bag, and when he commeth home he findeth there nothing but a Capons leg, for in this case of mine: the buyer buyeth lesse then the Seller selleth by xix. partes, which me think should kéep them from argument vpon the price whi∣lest either of them would fain make the best bargain for him self, as the maner of all chapmen is. And for which reason
<PB REF="34"/> <HI>Iesus Sirach</HI> saith of them, that sinne sticketh betwéen the bi∣er and the seller as fast as dooth a nail stick betwéen two stōes in a wall.</P>
<P>This way haue I brought to be stronger and better assu∣red then any entaile generall or speciall both whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h priuate couetise hath found a way to destroy to the disheris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of ma∣ny a good kinred and to the great decay of vertue and godly∣nes, and héerin (quoth hée) I haue doon my heirs n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrong, for vpon this rent I haue liued contēt and doo, &amp; if they prooue honest and vertuous: so may they doo, and then I haue left them inough. and if they prooue otherwise: then hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I left to much and yet to little to serue them also.</P>
<P>Moreouer (quoth hée) I haue héerby prouided against the malice of such tenaunts as abuse the liberalitie of good Land lords fetting and letting ouer vnto the third and fourth hand racking and enhaunsing the things vnto excessiue and vnrea∣sonable rents, and such as the Landlord him self would ne∣uer haue doon for pure shame and pittie, which neuerthe∣lesse béeing raised to his hand by others: is a perillous pre∣sident vnto him at his return vnto the possession therof.</P>
<P>Thus you haue heard (quoth our Hoste) what a godly and Fatherly care this good and vertuous Maiestra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had to preferre the honour and glory of God and also the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommon welth of his Cuntry and People, whereby it may appéere how hartely to be desired is the purchase of such P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsonnes whose riches is the Treasury and Storehouse of the com∣mon welth, aswell for the sustenaunce of the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concer∣ning worldly and bodily prouision of transitorie things: as also for the furtherance and increase of Vertue, godlines and Pietie, Looue and Concord.</P>

It fortuned that I went into a Lawyers Chamber in Sergeants Inne with a Fréend of mine who was Plaintiff in a repleuin in Bedford shire, and being come into his Law¦yers Chamber and hauing staied there a while about our bu¦sines: there came in an ancient Gentleman of the Cuntry, whome I know very wel by sight and haue doon long, whom when the Maister had espied comming vp euen at the top of the staires, hée spake to him as followeth.

<HEAD>The Second Book, declaring the Questions and An∣swers between the Author, the Hoste, and Pierce Plowman.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 THe first Question put by me, whether it be more pro∣per to vertue and godlynes to giue or to lend, or to pay that a man oweth.</P>
<P><HI>Pierce Plowman</HI> answered, that of those thrée to giue was the best, to lend was the next, &amp; as for paying that which a man oweth: he held it a duty, &amp; in dooing of duty there stan∣deth no Godlynes, neither lieth there any thank therin, &amp; that (he said) appéereth by <HI>Christe</HI> his owne woords who sayeth, that when wée haue doon that which was our duty: wée are vnprofitable seruants, neither hath paying, of debts any ex∣presse testimony of Godlynes or vertue, in the Scriptures of God, or by common experience among men, wheras giuing hath a name of vertue, namely of liberallitie wherof the Pro¦phet <HI>Dauid</HI> speaketh thus. He hath dispersed and giuen vnto the poore, and his righteousnes remaineth for euer. Again oof lending he saith. The righteous is mercifull and lendeth, and will guide his woords with discresion. To be short, liberalitie (which extendeth both vnto giuing and also lending) is a pro∣pertie of God, who both giueth and lendeth vnto vs his dayly gifts and blessings, but borowe he cānot neither pay his debt. And so shortly paying of debt in his opinion no vertue ne pro¦pertie of Godlines, for that it is a thing which God him self cannot doo, and so the first twaine, vertues and the third no vertue, but a duty.</P>
<P>OVr Hoste maintained the contrary, &amp; that to pay a mans debt is the moste excellent qualitie &amp; vertue of the thrée,
<PB REF="37"/> and moste peculier and proper vnto the children o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, and that the other twaine are no vertues, neither d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serue that name, saue so far foorth as they are included within this, and for proofe therof thus he reasoneth. Whatsoeuer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s or may be cause of euill: that same thing may it self be said to be e∣uill. What soeuer act corrupteth or dishonesteth t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dooer or the sufferer therof, or els bothe: that act is or may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> euil, con∣trariwise, whatsoeuer act dooth not neither cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t corrupt or dishonest the dooer nor the sufferer therof nor an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other per¦son; that act saith he neither is euill, neither by any meanes can be made or called euil. Lending saith he oft tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s corrup∣teth and dishonesteth the dooer therof, namely for Vsurye, sel¦ling the déerer for day giuen, both these are lendin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in their kindes, and yet not any properties of Godlines no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vertue.</P>
<P>But to speak of the best lending and that which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imply w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out any of the regards aforesaid, yet meaneth the lender to haue his things again, and therfore what godlyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is there saith <HI>Christe</HI> if you bid them to dinner y<SUP>t</SUP> can bid yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> againe, what great godlynes haue you shewed therin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much of lending. Gifts are giuen oft-times to corrupt and so peruert Iustice, and therby both the dooer and sufferer dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onested. Gifts are giuen by the couetous in hope to receiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greater. Gifts are giuen by flatterers and Clawbacks, nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly super∣fluous and excessiue feasts and banquets vnto P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inces and great estates, to the end vnder their authoritie to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide vpon the poore and godly people, and to deuoure and spoyle the la∣bours of all others of the common and meaner sorie, to the great oppression of vertue and godlynes, and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat in∣crease of al wickednes and vngodlynes. Gifts are g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uen in si∣mulation of frendshipp when nothing is so little m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, and so wickednes vtterly concluded therby: In giuing is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stentati∣on and vaine glory, and these two are the fathers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d mother of flattery. For where <HI>Thraso</HI> is <HI>Gnatho</HI> wil be als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, giuing vnto one fréend and not vnto the rest, if a man ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; many▪ procureth their hatred and enuye against both the giuer and the receiuer. Shortly it standeth togither to be a large giuer: and yet a moste wicked and vngodly person, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erof are
<PB REF="38"/> great examples namely of <HI>Cateline,</HI> of whom <HI>Salust</HI> writeth that he was prodigall of his owne, &amp; desirous of other mens. And of <HI>Silla</HI> that cruell Tirant hée reporteth this, he would giue no man more frankly, lend he would also very liberal∣ly, but what soeuer he could borowe: he would neuer pay a∣gaine. Now vnto the third part, to wit paying a mans debt, and which (saith he) I call the moste high and soueraign ver∣tue, and the moste proper vnto Godlines, and that for these causes. First it neither corrupteth nor dish nesteth the dooer nor the sufferer therof, for I am sure al men wil confesse that a man may honestly pay that which he oweth, and he vnto whom he ought it, may honessly craue the same.</P>
<P>Paying of def corrupteth no Iustice neither I suppose can be prooued euer to haue doon in paying of bet there is no ostenta∣tion of vaine glory, for it is not the déed of a proud minde, whose propertie is not to acknowledg any good turn for that might charge him with duty of acquitall wheron the proud and vngodly differ chéefly from vertuous and godly, for the proud may not séeme to haue néeded any mans good turn nei∣ther to haue vsed their help, both which things in paying their det they should implicatiuely confesse to haue doon, and therfore are they ashamed to repay what so they can borrow for the Conclusion aforesaid. And that standeth wel with the saying of Iesus of <HI>Sirack</HI> who saith that what so the vngodly can borrowe: hée accounteth it as if hée had found it, wherof the reason is this, although pure néed and necessitie constrain them oft to vse this woord (lend) yet they vse him for a cloke of dissimulation as the effect sheweth, for this is euident that there are but foure waies of attainment or getting of whatso¦euer thing, for it is either giuen vs, lent vs, or els wée take it perforce, or els wée found it.</P>
<P>So that whatsoeuer is lent vnto such people either it is giuen or lent, or taken by force or els found.</P>
<P>Giuen you wil say it is not, nor so ment by you, and you shall finde the same by him that took it at your hands, for hée will neuer giue you thanks therfore, neither sée you but a∣gainst his hart.</P>
<PB REF="38"/>
<P>Borowed it was not vpon his behalf, and conseq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently not vpon yours, howsoeuer you ment in departing the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>with for except there be a borower: there can be no lender, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are corelatiue and none can be without other, no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then there can be a Father without a Childe, then if the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did not borrowe: the other did not lend, hée borrowed not, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r you shall finde that with his good will hée neuer ment to pay it a∣gain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your lent it not.</P>

<P>¶ But now it resteth mée to prooue (quoth hée) th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this word (to pay a mans det) dooth include both the rest so farre saith as they may or can be called vertues or proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of godlines which I wil prooue in this order.</P>
<P>¶ First say, that whatsoeuer wée haue héer in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld: wée haue it at the bountifull &amp; mercifull hands of our God as lent and which hée may at his pleasure take from vs, as also wée dayly see him doo. Then if wée haue nothing but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at we haue receiued: (as Saint <HI>Paule</HI> saith) wée must needs c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfesse wée are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tted vnto him therfore. How then can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pay vnto him our det for hée receiueth no money we canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feast him, for hée neither eateth Buls flesh nor drinketh th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blood of Goates. It resteth then that wée giue vnto them that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Bayliffes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ereiuers for that intent a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pur∣pose, and vnto them in whose persounēs hée hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d him self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to wit unto his poore and godly Saints a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ser∣uaunts
<PB REF="39"/> that are héer vpon the Earth among vs, vnto whome whatsoeuer wée giue hée hath promised to accept it, as giuen vnto him as a payment of so much det, a testimony not of our merit: but of our woorking faith in his grace and mercy, and in this only sence and meaning, giuing and lending are vertues and proper vnto the Children of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. THe next Question put by our Hoste, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> whether is the harder matter to make a Lord or a Gentleman.</P>
<P><HI>Pierce</HI> answered, y<SUP>t</SUP> in all common reason &amp; also by experience the harder thing: the harder is the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing therof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hée) is a greater degrée then a Gentleman, and therfore har∣der to be made then a Gentleman.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Answered that I thought and knew the contrary by ex∣perience, For I knew (quoth I) where a Churle by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purchase of Mannour is become Lord of a number better men then himself, and so is hée a Lord and yet no Gentle¦men.</P>
<P N="3">3. THe next Question of <HI>Pierce</HI> Plowman was why p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore¦men are not called to office of estate and gouernment in common welths but euermore the rich and welthy.</P>
<P>OVr Hoste answered, because quoth hée, the poore would to be rich and so are not content with their present estate, but to desire alteration and chaunge and all such persones are more méet to be commaunded then to commaund in a commō welth. But of the rich and welthie it is clean otherwise, for they are already that which the poore haue desire to be, and therfore content, and consequently Fréends and furtherers of peace and vnitie which is neuer nor neuer wil be where they haue authoritie in their hands that are not content with their owne present state, and so great hazard of the common peace lieth therin.</P>
<P N="4">4 THe next Question by mé<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is the reason that the Sonnes and Children of great purchasers, namely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; and Merchants, are common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> such hee ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and

<P>OVr Hoste said it argued great equitie and consience in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Children in that they ment to buy wit, and to pay as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>éer therfore as their fathers and fréends had sold theirs.</P>
<P N="5">5 The next Question by our Hoste, what was first the reason of giuing and wearing of mourning gownes and gar∣ments for such as are deceased.</P>
<P>PIerce answered hée thought it was in fauour of our i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bi∣cilitie and weaknes, and for that reason: are not so p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one and ready to wéep so sore, namely rich widowes who ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not wéep so redily as a dog can make water, and therfore it was thought expedient that such mourning were, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld not mourne for other busines: they might be al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d vnto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> soone honest and coulorable meanes to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn by atturney, as wée sée y<SUP>t</SUP> in matters of law he that for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther necessary busines cannot attend vpon his causes: is receiued by his Attourney, and of these great heires, executor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and rich widowes that are otherwise necessarily occupied and haue no leisure to wéep: it was thought in like maner. Also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thought profitable for the parties themselues for that it is an honest mean of publicatiō aswel of the widowh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d as also of her great heuines, therfore wherby the more Coun∣selers may resort vnto her, for in strange places a wido<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is known from other by her wéeping and sorow.</P>
<P N="6">6 THe next Question by <HI>pierce</HI> what differeth a cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tous person from a Niggard. ¶ Our Hoste answered a ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gard is affraid to want him self, and therfore husbandeth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d spa∣reth, and oft liueth besides his owne.

<P><HI>I</HI> Answered, because that commonly folke take to much of them, and haue so great felicitie therin, the rather that the ministers of voluptuousnes and sensualitie may thriue, but the chéefest and best reason séemeth to be this that me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may knowe that Godlines and vertue are not tied vnto meat and drink, neither doo consist therin, as <HI>Christe</HI> hath said.

<P>this place, there fell a brabble betwéen two rich men concer∣ning trepasses by woords &amp; spéeches, wherupon one of them sued the other &amp; had demanded by action M. l' damages. I can not tell how, at length they were both content to put the rout¦ter vnto two men of worship their neighbours, and became bound in great sinnes either to other to stand to their awards &amp; order therin. The plaintif for their better instructed deliue¦red vnto tharbitrators a copy of his declaration &amp; of y<SUP>e</SUP> whole issue, wherin the party Defendant to some of the matter had pleaded not giltie: &amp; other some had iustified, wherupon th'ar∣bitrators hauing duely considered, and heard the in allegati∣ons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f of both their matters, ordered as fole∣weth, that the partie defendant béeing guiltie of diuers mis∣behauiours by the Plaintife against him alleadged: should therfore pay two hundred fiftie pound vnto the common tre∣sure of fiue Parishes next adioining, to be there imploied and bestowed at the discretion of the moste honest and best at the said Parishes and vnto the partie plaintif for all his coste <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this awarde béeing shewed and read vnto the parties they were both highly displeased therat.</P>
<P>The plaintif for that the Arbitrators had giuen that vn∣to Strangers (saith hée) which should haue béen his and so haue excéeded the limits of their authoritie and the tenour of his submission. The defendant thought him gréeued with the greatnes of the sum and so both the parties highly displeased.</P>
<P>The Arbitrators maintained their awarde and order to be both iust and reasonable. First for the Defendaunt, they said they were of duety bond to punish him vpon good &amp; due proofs made by his Aduersarie of his the vngodly behauiour, where neuerthelesse they had qualified his punishment and the de∣maunde by his Aduersary. As touching the plaintif and the sum which hée demaūded by the name and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earin of a∣mends: their answere was that they ment it such to wit an a∣mends and that not only vnto one of them but to them both for they hoped that the Defendaunt by that time hée hath pai∣ed the two hundred &amp; fiftie pounds wil be better héerafter as concerning the like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce and so hée hath his amends, but

<P>¶ With that the two parties drew foorth either o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers ob∣ligation, &amp; cancelled them bothe, and took hands and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eparted home great Fréends spite of the Arbitrators and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their a∣warde, and so ij. Churles were made fréends.</P>
<P>THis tale béeing ended, <HI>Pierce Plowman</HI> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>éeds ac∣quite with an other tale not vnlike. It chaunce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one day (quoth hée) while I was in my Councellers Cham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er in the Inner Temple: there came a woman dwelling about the Strand, and prayed his councell, and what action s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might bring against an other woman a neighbour of hers, that had said to her in open presence of diuers of her neighb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs, that she had already twise escaped the Gallowes. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lawyer asked of her if she had neuer in her life passed by a pair of Gal¦lowes. She answered yes. So haue I doon (quoth h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>) I thank my God, and that some time when there haue béen a dozen
<PB REF="43"/> hanged, and so I think haue you (quoth hée). True it is Sir quoth she. Then quoth he, ye cannot recouer for those woor∣des, for they beare good couller of iustification, and also shew that ye haue had better fortune then possible many a better mans Childe, and so haue I my self also. With this answere the good woman held her self wel apaid, and went her way con¦tent.</P>
<P>THen began my tale. There is dwelling in <HI>Holbourne</HI> (quoth I) and that not very far from the place where I doo lye, a certain man whome I haue noted this long time to be a man of strange affection, for béeing a man of great wealth and therfore the méeter for company, yet if any fréend or neighbour require him to goe with them to the Tauern, to the Ale house, to the Theater, to y<SUP>e</SUP> Curtain as they tearm it, or to Paris garden or any such place of expence: he vtter∣ly refuseth, &amp; after their return that willed his company: his maner is to go vnto some one of them, desiring him to tel him truely what hée hath spent since his going foorth, which ha∣uing learned at him whether it be a grote or sixpence, more or lesse, hée goeth straight vnto a Cofer that hée hath standing secretly in his Chamber, which hath a Til, in the which Til there is a little clift, at the which clift hée putteth in asmuch mony as the partie said y<SUP>t</SUP> had spent, and this til, hée neuer o∣peneth vntill the end of the yéer, so often times hée findeth ther in fortie shillings, oft times thrée or foure pound or more and this he taketh and bestoweth vpon his poore neighbours, and vpon other godly busines imployeth it.</P>
<P>And vpon the lid of his Chest is written in great Romain letters, take from thy kinde, and giue to the blinde.</P>
<P>This tale béeing ended, the night some what far rumour Hos¦tesse warned vs therof and that it was high time to go to bed, which we were all contented to doo sauing <HI>Pierce</HI> Plowman, who had yet one other tale to tel, and prayed vs to giue him the hearing, which we graunted him, and then hée began.</P>
<P>¶ There is héer about (quoth <HI>Pierce</HI>) a Gentleman that hath enlarged his rent but not his land (where in many are very expert at this day) &amp; once vpon a time of my being in his
<PB REF="43"/> house there came in a poore tenaunt of his, one that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> béen long tenaunt both to his father and others his Aunc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stors, which poore man pittifully said vnto him as followeth</P>
<P>Alas Sir (quoth hée) in your Fathers and graundf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers dayes I liued wel and kept at the least twentie Kine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esides Oxen and horses, and now through your hard dealing with me I am not able to kéep twain.</P>
<P>Wel quoth the Gentleman thou liest, for I haue b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n bet∣ter to thée: then euer my Father or Grandfather wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for where by thine owne confession in their time thou di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st kéep but twentie Kine: now thou maist kéep two hundre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the least, for now (quoth hée) through my fréendship thou maist be the common Neat hearde, and kéep al the beasts in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> town.</P>
<P>And thus our tales béeing all ended: wée required <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sen∣tence of our Hostesse therin, shée said that truely in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er opi∣nion the Stranger (meaning mée) had tolde the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale and wherby shée had gotten moste Example of edifica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion and knowledge, whereby to help and instruct both her self and others, and giuing mée great and hartie thanks therfore: shée gaue Iudgement that I should break my fast the next day at the charges of her Husband and <HI>Pierce</HI> Plowman, shée said farther that to that man of whome I tolde the tale: shée was Detter, if she knew how to doo him good.</P>
<P>¶ So héer wée ended, and went to bed, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext day <HI>Pierce</HI> Plowman was vp very early, and called mée vp and our Hoste, (as sithens I haue learned his maner is alwaies to doo) gathered vs all together with the residue of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s house∣holde, mainy, Children and Seruants.</P>
<P>And hée him self red vnto vs a Chapter of the new Testa∣ment, and then wée altogether sung the fiftéen Psalme of <HI>Da∣uid,</HI> and that doon to breakfast went, and after break<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast: I my self would néeds pay the whole charges therof, and bid, (not∣withstanding the awarde of our Hostesse and their great in∣stance to the contrary.)</P>
<P>And when I would departe: my Hoste and <HI>Pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce</HI> Plow∣man would (whether I would or no) bring mée on my way to <HI>Doncaster,</HI> and did, and there caused mée to haue great en∣tertainment
<PB REF="44"/> without a peny charges for one whole day, and then wée took either leaue of other, and departed each of vs toward his owne.</P>
<P>After which departure, vpon the way as I traueled: I re∣membred y<SUP>e</SUP> Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> who saith. <HI>I was glad when it was said vnto mee, wee shall go into the house of the Lord,</HI> which I suppose be neuer ment by a cōmon Inne or hosterie, where neuerthelesse I may safely say I found it. And therfore full true it is y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Ouid</HI> saith, there is oftentimes a good fish in a wa∣ter where a man would little think. Wée boast much of ciui∣litie and nurture in the South partes of this land, namely in London, and dispraise and dispise the North as rude and vn∣ciuil, but surely for mine owne parte (that am a Southern∣man and borne in Kent) to speak indifferently for any thing that euer I haue found in all my trauel in both the partes: I cannot sée nor know why the Northern People should not rather pittie vs then enuie vs concerning either Godly∣nes, Vertue or good maners, for héer I haue spoken of the ba∣sest kinde of People, wherby it may partly approoue what hope there is of the Gentlemen, merchants and them of the good Townes and Citties, for whose sakes and generally for all others I vndertook to gather and to report this little Con∣ference, and with Gods help and fauour haue doon it as néer accordant to the trueth as I could, neither adding therto nor taking there from, the desire wherof caused mée to take the lesser Iournies homewarde and to write it by parcells at my Innes least I might haue forgotten it.</P>
<P>And héerin I protest, that I haue neither flattered nor be∣lyed any man, for my meaning is trueth and the commen∣dation therof, and therin is no flattery, for surelie if I haue flattered any body: it is mine owne self in y<SUP>t</SUP>, that where be∣fore I was perswaded that pride had vtterly corrupted this whole common welth and had clean ouer spred it with his ge¦neration of all vngodlynes and wickednes wherof all times and ages doo agrée him to be the father: sithence this Iourney I begin to hope y<SUP>t</SUP> God wil haue mercy vpon vs, and hath and that hée hath reserued vnto him self a remnaunt as hée did
<PB REF="44"/> in the time of <HI>Elias,</HI> for whose sakes hée will spare the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est as hée offered vnto <HI>Abraham</HI> touching <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra.</HI></P>
<P>Therfore the intent of this my collection thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppea∣ring: I refer my self to the iudgement of them to whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hāds it shal héerafter come, desiring their good woord in reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pence therof, and also of my long and weary Iourney wherof this labour was mine only rewarde.</P>
<P>Beséeching Almightie God of his great mercie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd cle∣mency to graunt vnto the same no wursse effect then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> haue ment therin, and that by the Appostles councel, we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y con∣sider that wée are but strangers and pilgrimes héer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earth, and that there after wée may order our liues and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersati∣on longing for our owne Cuntrie, content to suffer, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to for beare and glad to heare or sée the thing that may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ée for our edifying, learning and knowledge to bée the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ée∣ter and better welcome into our Cuntrie which is the Heauenly <HI>Ierusalem</HI> whether God for Christes sake bring vs all Amen.</P>
