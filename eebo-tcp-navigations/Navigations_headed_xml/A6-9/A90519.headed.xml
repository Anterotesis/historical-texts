<OPENER><SALUTE>Gracious Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Ot only</HI> freewill-offerings <HI>and gifts were acceptable to God, though they had a member, or members</HI> superfluous, <HI>or were</HI> deficient <HI>in some, and so had much</HI> imperfection, <HI>so it were not of the nature of</HI> unsincerity, <HI>in which respect they behoved to be</HI> without ble∣mish;
<PB REF="3"/><HI>(Levit. 22.23.) but in</HI> trespass-offe∣rings <HI>also, which were commanded and not left</HI> free, <HI>if the Party was poor, not only a</HI> single Tur∣tle, <HI>or young</HI> Pigeon <HI>was accepted (for the other was for an Holocaust) but a</HI> single meat-offer∣ing, <HI>a very little Flower or</HI> Meal, <HI>and a</HI> little Salt <HI>to it, were accepted for</HI> both Holocaust <HI>and</HI> trespass-offering <HI>under one:</HI> (Lev. 5.7.) <HI>which being doubtlesly in use from</HI> Noahs <HI>time, or</HI> A∣dams <HI>rather, as elsewhere I hope to make it appear, gave as undoubtedly the beginning to that practice and proverb among the</HI> Heathens (Heathenism <HI>being but an inveterate corruption of</HI> heresie <HI>and</HI> schism <HI>from the Religion delivered by God to</HI> A∣dam, <HI>and</HI> Noah, <HI>as shall also God willing be made appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) molâ salsâ litant, qui non habent thura; such may acceptably sacrifice to God with meal and salt, who have not frankin∣cense. <HI>The like debonnairety to accept of</HI> mean gifts <HI>from</HI> good mindes, <HI>hath also been annume∣rated to the heroick indowments of the greatest Kings. Thus</HI> Artaxerxes <HI>disdained not a pitcher of water from a Paisant. And</HI> Plu∣tarch <HI>in his Apophthegms shows by one of them, the property of a royall disposition to have been esteemed this;</HI> Non minus est regium parvula accipe∣re, quam largiri magna, It is no less Kingly to accept of little things, than freely to be∣stow great matters.</P>
<P><HI>And this, Royall Sir, is my humble request to your saered Majesty at this time; That you will graciously accept a</HI> mean gift <HI>from a</HI> mean giver,
<PB REF="3"/><HI>and by your royall return of justice and bountie to enable me to serve God, and your Majesty with better; God himself inviting you thereto by his example, who allowed even of</HI> poor freewill∣offerings, <HI>made to him of purpose, to obtain his bountifull returns of some eminent benefits or fa∣vours. And yet</HI> a mean gift, <HI>Sir, I call this of mine, not that the</HI> work it self <HI>should be so ac∣counted, but</HI> my work about it; <HI>which is but a Translation. For the Book though in bulke but small, in its concernments is very rich; and, as highly commendable in it self, so not much less in the Author. In its natural language it made its first address to Cardinal</HI> Mazarine, <HI>in order to have set his Majesty of</HI> France <HI>on conquest of the great Kingdome of the</HI> Amazone <HI>to himself. But having these five years at least, that now it hath been abroad, not made use of it that way, it comes now by me to beg your Majesties favourable ac∣ceptance, in hope of that large retribution to your self, when your Majesty shall think fit to apply your thoughts to it, for which it was intended to another. It was by an old servant of your Ma∣jesties Royall Fathers, and Gandfathers,</HI> I. L. D. <HI>brought over, and communicate to one of your Ma∣jesties most expert Seamen,</HI> C. W. <HI>who from his youth up, and often times since, hath been in, and knowes perfectly all the coasts of the</HI> Southern A∣merica. <HI>Both these are very confident, at least wish heartily, and my self with the like affection do now humbly present it also, That your Majesty would so consider of that great Empire, as if it</HI>
<PB REF="4"/><HI>were already your own; as it may be with much ease, if your applications be seasonable, and suita∣ble to its worth. For it is possest by the barbarous Natives only, except in two</HI> Skirts; Brasile <HI>on the East, where the</HI> Portuguaise <HI>pitched; and</HI> Peru <HI>upon the West, where the</HI> Spaniard <HI>is divided from the</HI> Inland <HI>by the tract of the</HI> Andes, <HI>or</HI> Cor∣deliere hills: <HI>but in the</HI> Peninsular <HI>great conti∣nent your Majesty may dresse an</HI> Empire <HI>of near nine thousand miles in circuit, of the pleasantest, fertilest, and richest continent in the world, whe∣ther for air, waters, or soil; to which no Prince can pretend, much less lay a claim. For the disco∣veries of that River by the</HI> Portugaise, <HI>and</HI> Spa∣niards, <HI>were more to satisfie their curiosity, than that they could then hope for a conquest. And the Natives not only in their forlorn condition, but by singular junctures of providence, call for the Christian Religion from us, while others cease from that duty, as the man of</HI> Macedon <HI>did</HI> Paul <HI>to help them while he was hindred to go into</HI> Bithy∣nia, <HI>Act. 16.7, 9, 10. and others have been hin∣dred hitherto to go to them for such end; but they may also easily be made to receive your Ma∣jesties Government with friendship, if wisely dealt with. For while neither</HI> Portugall, <HI>nor</HI> Spain, <HI>nor</HI> France <HI>pursued the design here offered, God in in his providence amidst, your Majesties and your good Subjects troubles, seems not obscurely to have been designing this for you, and your</HI> Brittain; <HI>as may be hoped from</HI> ancient prediction, <HI>not liable to exception from the solidest and soberest wits (as
<PB REF="4"/>at another occasion I may fullier clear, if your Ma∣jesty command it) and so much the more, as his providence hath prevented your projecting, having already made way and brought to pass for your Majesties interest an opportune and considerable Colonie, by that noble Lord</HI> Willoughbee <HI>of</HI> Parham, <HI>to his great travels, hazards, and vast expenses; both seeming to concurre with the fore∣said prediction, and to point out your Majesty for the layer of such a foundation both to Christ, and your self.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Author of this work is a French Earl of a most ancient Nobility and descent from those famous and honourable Commanders in the holy Warres, who for their wise conduct and rare valour were imployed in places of great trust, and transmitted them with the Coat of arms and name of</HI> Pagan, <HI>(which was the badge of their great exploits in mating and killing the</HI> Pagans, <HI>or</HI> Infidels) <HI>to their suecessors of the same</HI> name <HI>and</HI> family, <HI>as the Author himself showes at large in the Dedicati∣on of his rare Book of Fortifications, to another noble branch of the same family: of whose rare ac∣complishments for</HI> gentile <HI>and</HI> manly learning, <HI>and</HI> Souldiery, <HI>lest I should here presume too much upon your Majesties patience, I shall leave further account of him to my Epistle to the Reader, and only present your Majesty with the summe of what he sayes to the</HI> Cardinal <HI>about the conquest; and that is;</HI> <Q><HI>That it will neither be</HI> hard <HI>nor</HI> expensive, <HI>as neither needing great Armies, to give battels; nor great provision of Artillery, for carrying on</HI>
<PB REF="5"/><HI>of sieges. There is need only of preparations fit∣ting for planting of five Colonies at the first a∣board. The first whereof is to be in the</HI> Isle of the Sun, <HI>for guarding the best entrie into the great Rivers mouth. The second on the famous</HI> Bosphore <HI>or</HI> Strait <HI>thereof, to defend, or keep this Rivers passage. The third on the renowned</HI> point <HI>of the</HI> Comanares, <HI>for the best seat of that whole Empire. The fourth near to the moun∣tain of</HI> Swana, <HI>whereby to be master of the gold∣mine there. And the fifth and last on the mouth of the River of</HI> Maragnon, <HI>to watch over the Frontier of that side of the</HI> Andes. <HI>And in fa∣vours of such a first establishment, there might easily be added the</HI> alliances <HI>of the Illustrious and renowned Nations of the</HI> Homagues, <HI>of the generous and noble</HI> Yorimans, <HI>of the vali∣ant and redoubted</HI> Topinambes; <HI>and order given for a</HI> Fleet-volant <HI>of about twelve men of Warre, continually to be visiting, and going between these Colonies: because the distance by sailing, of the farthest of them from the others, will be at the least a thousand Spanish leagues and alwayes upon the channell of the great</HI> Ama∣zone <HI>it self.</HI></Q> <HI>Thus he.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I call my gift also, a mean gift from</HI> a mean giver; <HI>not that I was, or am so</HI> mean <HI>in my self, as</HI> made so <HI>by the late troubles, and troublers of the times. For, Royall Sir, my Father Sir</HI> Robert Hamilton <HI>of</HI> Goswick, <HI>was Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber both to your Royall Father and Grandfather; and my Mother was by King</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>James <HI>himself preferred to his Queen, for one of her Maids of honour, and afterwards also by him∣self bestowed in marriage upon Sir</HI> Hadrian Dam∣mane, <HI>Lord</HI> Bisterveldt <HI>and</HI> Fair-hill; <HI>after whose decease my Father married her. My Fa∣ther, and any estate I should have had by him, I lost through the troubles of the times; and have wanted them now these seventeen years; for repa∣ration whereof, and coming hither to wait for it, I left one place of considerable value in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and spent here in three years attendance for repara∣tion, what I could then bring with me; and then embracing another place here in</HI> England, <HI>not much worse than the former, was not only again put from it, before I had enjoyed it full two years to an end, for keeping my fidelity to your Majesty in refusing to subscribe an engagement, or allegi∣ance (for so it was indeed, whatever they called it) to another Soveraignty; but suffered also four or five years banishment, to the almost irreparable de∣triment of my health and estate both; yea, and re∣fused all preferments from the usurpers, and the least compliances with them, both before my ba∣nishment, and now for seven years after, though I was wooed thereto, and might have got conside∣rable advancement with ease, could I have embra∣ced it with complyance; but would never so much as commence suit under them; though but for re∣covering some debts, or defending my self from others unjust pursuits. And that these losses, Sir, wherein consisted all my estate, and that a conside∣rable one too, when your Majesty shall know the
<PB REF="6"/>particulars, should make me poor, is little wonder; and that poverty through its disadvantages, and my former disparity of life, should ruine my health, is as little wonder; and that all the disadvantages, that a ruined health, and poverty can bring a man to, should disable me to do such thing as otherwise I could, and would have done, to present your Ma∣jesty with, is yet as little strange, as the former: but that I should yet be alive, poor as I am, to offer this poor gift unto your Majesty,</HI> that is the wonder. <HI>And indeed it is Gods good hand to∣wards me, whom I hope he hath reserved for doing himself, and your Majesty some greater service, before I be called hence. For, Royall Sir, God hath not made me so</HI> poor <HI>in gifts of minde, (of which as I may not brag, but by glorying in him, and in my infirmities or sufferings for him; so may I not</HI> ungratefully <HI>conceal, lessen, or undervalue to his dishonour, what they are, but with modesty confess, when just occasion flagitates and extorts it from me) through his blessing, if your Majesty will but pa∣tronize me (I shall not say</HI> Mecaenas-<HI>like; for that is too little for you, though it was truely said of him,</HI> Mecaenas atavis edite regibus! <HI>but</HI> Angustus <HI>like rather, beyond whom himself your Majesty is in this also, that you can number more Kings of your Progenitors, than were in all the Roman race of Kings, and Emperors both, either before, or after</HI> Augustus <HI>to this day) I hope to honour your Majesty with such gifts of mine own store, as never a King in Christendome for these sixteen hundred years, ever had Subject, that did
<PB REF="6"/>the like, though many have attempted,</HI> absint &amp; jactantia, &amp; invidia verbo: <HI>but your Majesty must midwife them, and my self both into the world again, and then by Gods assistance shall I renew my strength and youth, as the Eagle,</HI> &amp; sublimi feriam sidera vertice.</P>
<P><HI>If here it be wondred, that thus I implore your Majesties justice and favour, and made not ra∣ther a privater address, for repairing of my losses; I shall humbly and truely profess, that I have not left privater wayes unattempted; but finde all so obstructed with difficulties, and non-considerancies, or cold layings to heart of my case, that neither the health of my body, nor the strength of my purse would suffer me to hope for much good otherwayes, and from Courtiers, than thus by ushering in my Petition; and then I hope more seasonably, and succesfully to reap the fruits of a privater appli∣cation. I thought often of that course, that the poor Widow took with</HI> Philip <HI>of</HI> Macedon, <HI>the Fa∣ther of</HI> Alexander <HI>the Great: who when she had attempted by</HI> Courtiers, <HI>and</HI> Favourites <HI>to get justice done her, but could not prevail with them to preferre her business to the</HI> King; <HI>resolved to attaque him her self, the best she could, come of it what would; though of him at worst, she hoped much better, than of any of his Courtiers, as I al∣so do of your Majesty now. Casting her self there∣fore in his way, when she knew, he was to ride out, with high vociferations she cryed after him,</HI> Help my Lord, O King; help O King! <HI>He com∣manding to stand, and see what ailed her; she</HI>
<PB REF="7"/><HI>desired him to read and answer her Petition with justice. He answering that it was unfit then, and that he had not leasure for it; she replyed up∣on him boldly, That then</HI> he should not be at leasure to be King, <HI>if he could not have leasure to right his meanest Subjects, when all their pa∣tience and endeavours were otherwayes frustrate and wearied out. Upon which he was so far from being dissatisfied with her, that rather admiring her resolution, he most generously and heroickly gave her a present hearing, and full right of her wrong. Sir, my way is not so course, as hers was, but by a gift (which both with God, and all noblest spirits among men, finds acceptance) though but a poor onee, to have the softer access to your Majesties favour, and a cordialler consideration of my case, when it comes to your Majesty in a more particu∣lar way; and an easier grant of privacy for imme∣diate imparting your Majesty with some things, which is more for your Majesties good, than for my particular. Thus wise</HI> Abigail <HI>not only pacified</HI> David <HI>towards an unthankefull and churlish</HI> Na∣bal, <HI>but made way for her self for such a surplus∣sage of favour, as she little dreamed of, to become a Kings wife, and royal bedfellow, and her issue pre∣ferred in the entail of the Crowr, before all other of</HI> Davids <HI>children, except</HI> Bathshebaes. <HI>It is re ported of</HI> Alexander Severus, <HI>the Emperour, b</HI>∣Aelius Lampridius <HI>in his life, that be quarrelledy with every vertuous person, that be knew, who ei∣ther asked nothing of him, or but little.</HI> Quid est (inquit) quod nihil petis? An me vis tibi fieri
<PB REF="7"/>debitorem? Why ask you nothing of me? Would you have me to die in your debt? <HI>Sir, lest I presume too much upon your Majesties great affairs, in exceeding the bounds of an Epistle to so great a Prince, for the length whereof already I humbly beg pardon, my hopes and desires are that you shall not come short of any of those Worthies, or of the most heroick Princes, but surmount them all, in all royall endowments, to your becoming the Crown and rejoycing of all the</HI> reformed, <HI>in prose∣cuting their interest, which is Gods, and becoming their</HI> uniter <HI>and</HI> head, <HI>that you may be</HI> Carolo magno major, <HI>as undoubtedly you will, if thus you do: and which that you may do, Long may your Majesty live in all piety, plenty, and peace; or else just and happy triumphs here; and hereafter in the joyes and triumphs of heaven, where there is nothing but glory, triumphs, and joy without end. So prayeth</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG></HI> Must give thee some more account of the Author of this Booke, and of its worth, and of my self, his Translatour, and so bid thee farewell. About the Author, I shall not repeat, what hath been said of him before, in my Dedication to his Ma∣jesty for his just commendation, and of this Book of his in particular, but referre thee thither, if thou art desirous to know it. I shall here only adde, That he was in great employment and favour with the late King of <HI>France, Lewis</HI> the thirteenth, for his great parts of conduct and valour in his service; wherein unfortunately he received a shot of a Pistoll in the left eye, whereby it was quite lost, and the conjugation of the optick nerves so crushed, that he hath lost the use of both now above these twenty yeares: yet, which is wonder∣full,
<PB REF="9"/>is still penning new Books, and in Mathe∣maticks especially, which indeed needs least the outward sense; amongst which is that master∣piece, The ten Books of Geometricall Theorems, wherein he compleated and demonstrated so many diverse, and distinct parts of Mathematicall Sciences. His Book of the theory of Planets is Geometrically demonstrated, without any mixture of Physicall equations, by which <HI>Reignoldus</HI> and <HI>Kepler</HI> laboured so much to perfect the Geometricall, wherein their deferents, and Epicicles could not serve their turn. But this Gentleman hath found out both the center of the Planets, and demon∣strated their motions to be ellipticall, which no man afore him could attain to. And in conse∣quence to his theory, he published Astronomicall tables two yeares ago, wherein with great facility and exactness, the motions of all the Planets may be supputate, the Eclipses of the two great lumi∣naries, and the celestiall configurations: and in consequence to them, a facile method of finding out the true longitudes, both by sea, and land. His more than ordinary skill in Geography, may be seen by his two Advertisements to Geographers, at the end of this Booke, and by the Book it self: where∣in with great judgement and brevity he hath given an excellent, and the clearcst description of a great part of <HI>America,</HI> that any where is to be had: he having collected this out of all the best relations, and discoveries, that were extant; and corrected their errors, adding a Mapp of his own. All which his Pieces here mentioned, and in my Dedi∣cation
<PB REF="9"/>to his Majesty shall be by me made English Denizens, if this be well accepted, and the other required. The Books are not here to be had for money, but from such, as himself gifted them to; amongst whom is an old servant of his Majesties, my <HI>L. D.</HI> from whom this Book came, and who still keeps a correspondence with him, and is gift∣ed with every Piece, that be publisheth. The Author is still a privy Counsellour to his now Majesty of <HI>France;</HI> and as his <HI>naturals</HI> appear to have been great, so also they have been much a∣dorned, and elevated by his <HI>Gentlemanny</HI> learn∣ing, which he hath industriously followed; and consists in these dayes (the greater the fault of <HI>Pedants,</HI> that make any learning ungentile; as indeed none is where it hath a <HI>gentile</HI> client) chiefly in <HI>Politicks,</HI> and <HI>History,</HI> and <HI>Mathema∣ticks</HI> with their appendants, as conducible to a Gentleman, and a Souldier: and after he was disabled from <HI>Field-action,</HI> by the loss of his sight, some theoreticaller Mathematicks also. This is not rare in <HI>France,</HI> That <HI>Grandees</HI> there are well versed in such studies, as by Duke <HI>de Roha∣nes</HI> Interest of Princes, and <HI>Perfect Capitaine,</HI> and many other <HI>French Gentlemens</HI> Pieces of a like nature, may appear. And it were to be wish∣ed. That elsewhere also, Grandees and Gentry were both as well trained up, and had as good op∣portunity of such peculiar <HI>Academies,</HI> where all gentile, and Souldierly exercises, and requisites for conduct and command, are taught, as the French have; and the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> to his
<PB REF="10"/>immortall praise (himself having been bred in the <HI>Academy</HI> of <HI>Benjamin</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> where I my self saw him at his exercises) to the Weal of his Coun∣trey, and from his own estate, was going to enrich the confederate Provinces; that as they were be∣fore a School of Warre, for experience and practice, especially about sieges, and taking in of Towns; so they might be for breeding also to field-services, and all warlike atchievements.</P>
<P>Yet the French are so far from envying others, that attain to any perfection in these things, other∣wayes, or elsewhere, that there is no where rea∣dier preferment for their merits, or more honour done to such, as I could instance of late memory; which is <HI>truly noble.</HI> For there is a <HI>money-no∣bility,</HI> or <HI>Gentry,</HI> that is now crepe into the world, through abuse, and pesters it with many inconveniences, having nothing of the <HI>thing,</HI> but the <HI>name</HI> only, and <HI>empty</HI> titles; nor of that con∣nexion of <HI>virtues,</HI> and with <HI>virtue,</HI> without which <HI>true Gentry,</HI> or <HI>Nobility</HI> cannot be, nor subsist, had it never so much <HI>riches, antiquity of descent,</HI> or <HI>windy</HI> titles from <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>State.</HI> For <HI>true Gentry</HI> is <HI>virtus generis, vertue running in a blood,</HI> and either increasing, or descending in a <HI>race,</HI> or <HI>breed.</HI> It's <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> i. e. <HI>generosity,</HI> or an excellency of <HI>a kindred,</HI> or <HI>family,</HI> but su∣stained, or encreased still with <HI>vertue</HI> suitable to its beginning, or first <HI>advancement. Nobilitas sola est, atq: unica virtus.</HI> All mankind was made of <HI>one blood,</HI> and all Nations of men, that dwell upon all the face of the earth, <HI>Act. 17.26.</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>(there were no <HI>Praeadamites,</HI> as brainsick <HI>Pierrier</HI> dreamed) to whom God determined the times be∣fore appointed, and the bounds of their habitations; so as none, either <HI>men,</HI> or Nations, can claim truly any prerogative of <HI>nobleness,</HI> but by their <HI>virtue,</HI> as the <HI>Bereans</HI> are witnessed to have been more <HI>no∣ble,</HI> than the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> for their un∣prejudicateness and candour, by Gods own unerring Spirit, because they <HI>unpartially</HI> examined, what was proposed to them, and held not the truth of God, With acception of persons, <HI>Act. 17.11.</HI> All were certainly <HI>noble</HI> at first, and had ever continued so, had it not been for sin, because all were the of∣spring of God, <HI>Act. 27.28, 29.</HI> And God begot, or <HI>made</HI> no <HI>ignoble</HI> children, as the Greeks and French use to phrase it. <HI>Sin</HI> only brought in <HI>ig∣nobleness</HI> then, and degeneracy, as virtue only makes and maintains the contrary: what for <HI>vir∣tue naturall</HI> (let not Sciolists here mistake me; for <HI>virtue naturall</HI> rightly expounded, is no wayes contrary to sound Divinity) what for <HI>acquired;</HI> what for <HI>intellectuall;</HI> what for <HI>morall;</HI> what for <HI>hereditary and transmitted</HI> by descent (which is all one with <HI>naturall;</HI> there being <HI>igniculi; &amp; semina virtutum</HI> in nature, which are called <HI>na∣turall</HI> or <HI>hereditary vertues,</HI> as well as there is in <HI>sicknesses,</HI> and <HI>soundness</HI> of health) it is only vertue still, that makes <HI>true gentry,</HI> or <HI>genero∣sity,</HI> and keeps it <HI>afoot. Est in equis patrum virtus, nec imbelles &amp; degeneres procreant a∣quilam columbae.</HI> The ground of <HI>generosity,</HI> whence other gentry regularly proceeds, I mean
<PB REF="11"/>that of preheminence <HI>in offices,</HI> or <HI>power,</HI> whether Oeconomick, or Civil; where unto I must not now enlarge my self, to speak in particular) <HI>Jacob</HI> in his testament to his sons, doth both philosophically and divinely set down, to wit, the <HI>impregnation of nature,</HI> and <HI>elevating of the phancy and spi∣rits,</HI> to the highest and noblest thoughts, and incli∣nations, that ones condition, and way of breeding can suffer them to mount up to; which God himself also teaches in another place, when he says, that <HI>he would rejoyce over Israel, as a bridegroom rejoyceth over his bride.</HI> For then is that special time of <HI>loves,</HI> Ezek. <HI>16.8.</HI> (not <HI>romantick</HI> only, much sinfully such, as most romances are wicked, and have death in the pot, but common and natural, especially to common men; though wise men, that under stand nature, and can govern her, may both inhance that without sin, and make other times equall, if not go beyond it) and love is the seminary of all <HI>nobleness,</HI> and productive of all vertue, and <HI>ver∣tuous emulation</HI> to vertuous actions, and growth therein; as hatred and envy are of the contrary; witness that example <HI>Act. 17 5, 6, 7, 11, 12.</HI> And it must needs be so, seeing <HI>conjugall love</HI> was the first measure, and fountain of all <HI>neighbourly</HI> love, and neighbourly love is the <HI>fulfilling</HI> of the Law; as the first <HI>summe</HI> of the second Table, or <HI>thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self;</HI> and <HI>do to others as thou would be done to;</HI> was vir∣tually included in that divinely inspired sentence of <HI>Adams;</HI> This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: according to that pronounced of <HI>all poor,</HI>
<PB REF="11"/>though never so great strangers; <HI>Hide not thy self from thy own flesh. Primogeniture</HI> then and <HI>nobleness</HI> were <HI>divinely</HI> and <HI>naturally</HI> both suppo∣sed to be conjunct, and consequent one to the other, because there the <HI>might</HI> of the parents, and <HI>begin∣ning</HI> or <HI>flowr</HI> of their strength, both as to body and mind were put forth in point of affection, and af∣fections are the <HI>seats</HI> of virtues: and therefore also to primogeniture was given the <HI>excellency of dig∣nity,</HI> and the <HI>excellency of power,</HI> i.e. the <HI>pre∣eminence</HI> and <HI>precedency</HI> before others, both of <HI>merit,</HI> and of <HI>office;</HI> or of <HI>nobility and high places</HI> of trust, whether in <HI>Church,</HI> or <HI>State-rela∣tion,</HI> and much more in <HI>Oeconomick:</HI> yet so, as it was alwayes forfeitable by vice, and devolvable to others more vertuous, as by <HI>Cain, Ishmael, Esau, Reuben</HI> and many more, is manifest. But want of breeding to noble thoughts, and ends; and instruction to inure to chast and continent love, and not to deflore so much as their fancies, before the due and lawfull time; abuse also of marriage to base ends and by-respects, especially of <HI>money;</HI> and imprudent choices in sundry other respects, grown common with prodigality, luxury, and many other vices, have in these Countreys and times flatted and unspirited all natural nobleness and generosity either into a soft effeminacy, or sowr vineger of <HI>pride,</HI> and <HI>vanity,</HI> imbittered with the gall of many other vices, instead of the <HI>generous</HI> wine, they came of. And where <HI>natural</HI> gentry, or ge∣nerosity is not, seldome is the other of <HI>morall</HI> and <HI>acquired</HI> to be found; and so we are left to empty
<PB REF="12"/>names of <HI>civill tities</HI> entailed upon riches and de∣scent, by creation, or patent. Certainly there is a wisdome, if we studied it as well, as some do the other, of having a <HI>noble breed</HI> of men and women, as well as there is of <HI>Horses, Cocks,</HI> and Cattle. None will think <HI>dunghill-Cockrell,</HI> fit for game; nor a <HI>jadish</HI> race for the services of a gallant <HI>Jen∣net:</HI> and yet we think any thing <HI>fit enough</HI> for our Progenie's, that hath but money enough. High birth and fortunes, are in themselves, both of them, the good blessings of God, and are in honour with all persons of honour, where ever they are, or have been in any, that have suitable vertues, but have parted with fortunes for vertues sake. But for a Gentleman whose fortunes are become unsuita∣ble to his ranke, whether by his own fault, or o∣thers, or by neither, but by wrong, or misfortune, for reparation of an estate, so far to forget himself, as to make money his <HI>leading motive</HI> in a choice, is <HI>ignoble</HI> enough, and ungenerous, and can hardly expect better fruits of his way. We know, he was a wise man, that said, <HI>Blessed art thou, O land, when thy King is the son of nobles!</HI> Eccles. <HI>10.7.</HI> And he that said, <HI>Nam genus, &amp; proavos, &amp; quae non fecimus ipsi, vix ea nostra voco,</HI> in opposition to too much standing on, or vaunting of descent without competent vertue and wisdome to correspond with it; said also, <HI>Et Mi genus ab Jove summo,</HI> to show his esteem of descent; and with virtue an∣swerable; especially of such a descent, as claimed to the best, that could be reckoned to. He that would be ashamed to claim so honourable a privi∣ledge,
<PB REF="12"/>if he can do it truely, and hath just occasion and circumstances to extort it from him, would show but himself too modest at best, and almost un∣worthy of it, especially if he had a better <HI>Jupiter</HI> in place to make both his address and claim to, than the other had. For as low as my fortunes are, I can claim to the best blood in <HI>England,</HI> and that by <HI>England,</HI> and neither very far off, nor in an ille∣gitimate way. Neither need I to be ashamed of my fortunes (though hitherto, which was my weak∣ness, I have been ashamed of them, whereas I ought not to have been ashamed, but of sin) seeing I part∣ed from them willingly, for retaining to vertue, and a good conscience. <HI>Solomon</HI> hath told me, that <HI>all things come alike to all;</HI> and that the <HI>race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to men of un∣derstanding, nor favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all,</HI> Eccles. <HI>9.2, 11, &amp;c.</HI> I was never lower yet, than that great and noble <HI>Generall,</HI> of that great Emperour <HI>Justinian,</HI> was unjustly brought, to his masters no little dispraise, <HI>Belisarius</HI> of immortall renown. And why should I be ashamed to lay open my case to so <HI>Royall</HI> a <HI>Physician,</HI> as I have done; or be diffi∣dent of the <HI>cure,</HI> since the fountain of civil honour (which he is) will do nothing contrary to true ho∣nour; and Gods <HI>Great Steward</HI> of fortunes and pre∣ferments, that are in his own gift, in his own do∣minions, will neither deal niggardly, ungenerously, or unjustly, where nothing but justice and right is sought? Far be any thing of this, from being ta∣ken
<PB REF="13"/>as contrary to the first founders of a noble race; who, though they cannot claim <HI>descent,</HI> yet are beyond most of those, that can: since it is more to <HI>give,</HI> or <HI>make</HI> a noble descent, than to <HI>receive</HI> it, and most <HI>cadets,</HI> prove oftner <HI>cadents,</HI> than <HI>culminants,</HI> and seldome equall their <HI>found∣ers,</HI> but <HI>unspirit</HI> themselves, and <HI>evaporate</HI> to a <HI>vappidness</HI> of money—or <HI>prediall-gentility.</HI> I mean not so much that, which is bought with mo∣my (for that may be so, where it deserved to have been given) as that which hath nothing but riches to sustain it. <HI>Cicero</HI> answered <HI>Salustius</HI> his ob∣jection of an upstart, well, (if we suppose the in∣vectives to be theirs) <HI>Ego meis majoribus virtute praeluxi; Tu tuis turpiter offudisti tenebras.</HI> And as for occupations, and offices, though some be justly accounted more <HI>fordid,</HI> and <HI>illiberall;</HI> others more honourable and gentile; yet all that are law∣full, coming from God, and from his <HI>Spirit,</HI> as well as these mentioned, and implyed, <HI>Exod. 31.3.</HI> &amp;c. none joyned with virtue, can justly <HI>ignobili∣tate</HI> any. Yea, I know none of the basest and meanest of them, but in conjunction with <HI>virtue,</HI> and <HI>piety,</HI> but especially when they come to put on some∣thing of the nature of piety it self, or <HI>immediate service</HI> to God, as some of them did under the Old Testament, God hath left place for them to be <HI>pareille to,</HI> or in conjunction with the highest. Thus <HI>David</HI> wished rather to be a doorkeeper in the house of his God (a Porter of the Temple) than to be a King in the Tents of wickedness. And to <HI>Moses</HI> his posterity, though King in <HI>Jeshurun,</HI> yea
<PB REF="13"/>more than a King, a King, Priest and Prophet, which is more than ever we read of any other (ex∣cept Christ, of whom be was therein a singular Type; ever a typicall <HI>Mediatour,</HI> for be conse∣crated <HI>Aaron</HI> to his Priesthood, which without being <HI>Priest,</HI> he could not have dine) yet there was no more allotted to them, but to be <HI>chief Porters</HI> in the house of God. What calling meaner than a <HI>Butcher?</HI> Yet the High-Priest, the second person in the Kingdome, and sometimes, and in some re∣spects, the first, was by his calling a <HI>sacred Butch∣er;</HI> and if I be not mistaken, as I hope in my Scrip∣turall researches I may show, that I am not, the King himself in some cases, was such a sacred Butcher in some sort, in that he killed his own sa∣crifices; and it was an high, and an eminent ho∣nour to him too; and ever bad been accounted, as the <HI>priviledge of the first-born,</HI> where the excel∣lency of dignity, and of power was by divine insti∣tution, before the <HI>Jewes</HI> policy was erected. A Preacher of this City, that now bears his head high, when a Gentleman showed him, (as I have heard from the Party) a Tract by him done into Latine, and subscribed in the Title-page, <HI>Per A. B. Nobi∣lem,</HI> &amp;c. he very smatterer-like, and pedantick∣ly bewryed his ignorance, that <HI>nobilis</HI> in Roman and purest Latine phrase, that we could have, sig∣nified a <HI>Gentleman;</HI> but he would not understand it otherwayes, but according to the <HI>Anglism</HI> that he was acquainted with, whereby <HI>Nobleman</HI> is ap∣propriate to Barons, Vicounts, Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A∣nother person of quality in this City (as I have
<PB REF="14"/>heard the Story) rising from a mean degree to great fortunes, had a distressed Gentleman (without the Gentlemans own knowledge) recommended to his company and Table: and thereupon the Citi∣zen himself inviting him too, he well accepted of it, and was as well taken with; and upon fur∣ther converse, so well, that he justly apprehended some more than ordinary favours towards him, if he would lay hold on them. To lay hold he was most willing, and did; but resolved to proceed cantiously and slowly, for many Reasons, which if they had known, or had the patience, till discreetly they might have been opened to them, they would have allowed of. But they construing this <HI>slow∣ness</HI> for <HI>neglect,</HI> were offended, and that so far, that at length (the Gentleman not finding it best to alter his procedure) the Citizen discharged him his house, though upon a contrary pretence. He took this as an high affront, as indeed it was. And they coming to know their mistake, invited him a∣gain, but so unsufficiently, the Master of the house being excepted from being the <HI>inviter,</HI> though he had been the <HI>discharger,</HI> that the Gentleman would not thereupon come so soon, as it seems, they expected him; but he did cast himself to meet with them, where he might either have a fuller invitati∣on from them that had the right, or opportunity to tell them, what an one their <HI>Deputy</HI> had given him. But he found them in a new discontent and mistake upon refusall of that invitation, which increased to such <HI>distance,</HI> that it could not be removed, through their too high carriage; which he disdained
<PB REF="14"/>the more, the higher it was; untill at length going about to beget a right understanding again, be re∣ceived such another signall affront, as he vowed never to enter their house, untill be knew he had a <HI>full</HI> and free invitation that came from him that discharged him. Matters standing thus now, the Gentleman, to whom I could not deny such a cour∣tesie, for many reasons; requested me, <HI>That thus in a cloud</HI> to others, I would find a way as soon as I could, to <HI>uncloud</HI> his business briefly to the par∣ties concerned, that they might make such use thereof, as they saw good. And I have chosen this way of examples subjoyned to the discourse of <HI>ge∣nerosity,</HI> by way of Apology for my self, and first opening my condition from that obscurity it lay un∣der, to prevent, or repulse the currish snarls of <HI>clownish Pedants,</HI> and <HI>Schiolists.</HI> My intent in this Translation, is (beside what I have exprest to his Majesty) the propagation of Religion, and the good of <HI>England.</HI> But if Religion be not better in∣tended, and attended, and prosecuted by underta∣kers, than it hath been at home, it may justly frustrate all, and cast us in as great confusions a∣broad, as it did at home. But because this would require more length, than this Epistle is now fit to be drawn unto, and I may have another occasion for it perhaps, ere long; I heartily recommend all to Gods blessing, and thy good acceptance, and bid thee farewell.</P>

His length is of greater extent, than that of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and <HI>Negro</HI> in <HI>Afrique;</HI> his breadth larger, than that of <HI>Ganges</HI> and <HI>Kiam</HI> in <HI>Asia;</HI> his navigation and portable∣ness is better, than that of the <HI>Danow</HI> and <HI>Rhine</HI> in <HI>Eurupe;</HI> his mouth, or entrance into the Sea, is more open, than that of <HI>Plata,</HI> and Saint <HI>Lawrence</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> and his depth is like unto that of the Oceane, and of the mediterrane-Sea. His inunda∣tions or overflowings are yearly, and fruit∣full; his aspect is every where and every way pleasant: all his branches and Rivers running out of him, are inhabited; his fields are all fertile, and all his adjoyning plaines or valleys cultivated. Chase, fish∣ing, and Venison are there every where great store; woods, fruits, and Corn-fields for harvest, cover the grounds and little hills there; and the sweetness of his Air is through all alike equally temperate: and both gold and silver are found in the Rivers and mountains there. Its peoples are in∣numerable; its Iles great and infinite in number, yet inhabited; all its peoples are spritely and nimble, and the riches of the Climate furnisheth them abundantly with
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>all things. This River's course is almost alwayes under the equinoctiall Line; and every where his nights and days are of alike length; and the other Rivers, that pay their tribute to him, are all under the tor∣ride Zone. Marvellous effects of the di∣vine providence, which having distanced so many Nations from the Sea-coasts and its commodities, hath given them so great Rivers and waters in so great abundance, that this famous River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> may reasonably enough be called an Ocean-Sea of sweet waters. But all its preroga∣tives, which by an universall consent, have made the title of the greatest River of the world be given unto it, shall more amply be seen, and with more particular deduction of Circumstances, in the following Chap∣ters of this Book.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the great Realm of the Amazone.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Peninsule</HI> or <HI>almost-Ile</HI> of the Southerly <HI>America,</HI> and almost in the midst of so great a Continent or main-Land,
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>there is a great extent of Land, covered with so many Nations, and watered with so many Rivers, that of it might be formed a Kingdome, or Empire of three thousand Leagues in compass, for one that would make the conquest of it. Its rich and opu∣lent Countries (which all of them together I call the great Kingdome or Realm of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> seeing all their waters and Rivers render themselves into this great and re∣nowned River of the <HI>Amazones)</HI> have for their boundaries, <HI>Brasile</HI> towards the East; the Kingdome of <HI>New-Granado,</HI> and the coast of <HI>Guiana</HI> towards the North; and towards the West, <HI>Peru,</HI> and the great <HI>Cor∣delier;</HI> and Southward <HI>Tucuman,</HI> and <HI>Para∣guais:</HI> all Provinces under the Crown of <HI>Castile,</HI> except <HI>Brasile,</HI> subject to the <HI>Por∣tugallians,</HI> that inhabit it. I said, of three thousand Leagues in compass, not precisely, but near to that dimension; because the di∣versity of Mapps, and of their opinions and reports, that have compassed it, not only cross one another, but also thwart them∣selves in their relations, that they give of it; as by name Father <HI>Christopher D'Acogna</HI> a Spanish Jesuit, and a principall author, and eye-witness of these things. But of
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>these doubtfull and diverse mensurations we shall speak elsewhere; let us here draw to∣wards an end of this Chapter, in telling you, That all this great Realm of <HI>Amazone</HI> is inhabited only as yet of <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Ame∣ricans,</HI> and not at all of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whether <HI>Castilians,</HI> or <HI>Portuguais.</HI> These have in∣deed discovered it, and run its length first of any, with their armed Navies; but only passed thorow, and never stayed any where to build fortresses, or plant colonies, as they have done in so great number, and with so great state and magnificence in other Countries of the same <HI>America.</HI> But if <HI>Spain</HI> happily situated for commanding over this new world, had turned her thoughts to∣wards the conquest of this Empire of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> instead of consuming un∣profitably so many Armies, and so great treasures in her Warres of <HI>Europe,</HI> as she hath done now for an hundred years; she might have enjoyed by this time the glory and advantages of so great an Empire: from the conquest of which now she is further off than ever, as well for the reason of her pre∣sent weakness, as her intestine division.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the Nations of this great Realm.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe innumerable Nations and Provin∣ces of this great Empire of the <HI>Ama∣zone</HI> are not all yet distinctly known by their severall names and languages, because the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who last navigated this fa∣mous River, have not marked them all, but only one hundred and fifty of them. The Provinces are all so mightily, peopled, and their habitations so thick, that from the last village of one Town, one may hear the noise of such as travail from the first vil∣lage of anopher. And yet so near a neigh∣bour hood not being able to keep them in peace, they are in continuall Warres one Nation against another. Yet neither am∣bition of command, nor greediness of acqui∣ring riches, not a desire to eat men, as Ca∣nibals of the same <HI>America</HI> have, are any of the grounds of so many cruell and bloody Battels; (without which were it not, for all this, so many people could never be contain∣ed in these Countries) but the cause of all these Fights, wherein are often slain an in∣finitie
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>of persons, is only for glory and re∣nown, and to have slaves of a strange, or other Nation than their own: and that be∣cause at home amongit themselves, the in∣nocence of their manners, and riches of the Climate, not being, apt to bring men to a necessity of serving others of their own ac∣cord, none is found there obliged to such a condition, but by force of Arms. And yet this invincible courage, that they exercise thus against one another, hath not yet ap∣peared against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> (who navi∣gate and run the River of <HI>Amazones</HI> in Arms) foras much as hither to either a light fleeing, if at any time they opposed them; or a mutuall amity embraced and consented to by them, have been the only Arms, which to this present they have employed a∣gainst these dominators of the new world, the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But all <HI>America</HI> being bar∣ren of Iron, we must not think it strange, if the inhabitants of this great Realm have been surprized with fear, (as all other <HI>In∣dians</HI> were, and are) of the Sword, the Musquiet, and of Artillery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAR. IV. <HI>Of their Arms, and Commerce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEing neither Steel nor Iron are found at all in the West-<HI>Indies,</HI> we must not marvell, if the <HI>Americans</HI> of this great Kingdom have no other Arms, but Ar∣rows and Javelots; about which notwith∣standing they are marvellously expert, not only for making them of hard wood, and sharp pointed, but also for shooting and casting them with so great force, that there∣with they pierce through and through the body of their enemies, which they hit. The same necessity makes them also use stones well brought to an edge, and Tor∣toise shells, for Axes, and Hatchets, and their instruments of travelling: the one for great wood, and the other for less, and houshold Utensils. But they use the horn of certain little Beasts, fastned to little hefts, for their finer works, which they make upon wood with marvellous skill. As for the Commerce of all these peoples on this great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and on other Rivers that run into it, they perform
<PB N="9" REF="22"/>it in Boats, which they call <HI>Canoès,</HI> that are made all of Cedar, and all of one piece, as in other places of the <HI>Indies;</HI> but with more ease, and better, than elsewhere; be∣cause this great River during its overflow∣ings, brings down so great a number of great Trees, that these peoples have no more to do to come by them, but every one to lay hold on, and stay as many as he desires, at his House, there to cut and hol∣low them, as he thinks meet. As for Cloathes, such as use any, have them all almost of Cotton: and for such as go na∣ked (which are the greatest part) neither excessive heat, nor rigour of cold forces them to cover themselves in that sort.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of their Customes and Religion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere were never any written Laws a∣mongst those peoples; and all their customes are almost much alike. Some of them live at liberty; and some of them un∣der Cacyques, or Lords, as the rest of <HI>A∣merica.</HI> They have Idols of wood made
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>by mans hand, which they adore as their gods, attributing to some of them the pow∣er over waters, and giving them a Fish for their mark: to others the power over fruits, and seeds of the earth. They have also such as they take for gods of Armies and Battels; and they openly avouch that these deities came down from Heaven to live with them, to do them good, and procure their profit. They have neither Temples nor Ceremonies, wherewith they adore them, but leave them carelesly in some corner of their House, untill they have occasion to use them. But when they take water to go to Warre, they place on the Poup of their Vessels, their god of Armies; and so they use the others in like sort. They have also <HI>Wisemen,</HI> or <HI>Wizards</HI> among them, of great esteem; who serve them for Counsellors as well for Religion and Physick, as for Law and policy; and in the year <HI>1639,</HI> the <HI>Portuguais</HI> found an <HI>Indian</HI> in these Coun∣tries, that called himself the son of the <HI>Sun;</HI> who coming to a peaceable and loving con∣ference with them, was not satisfied with the grounds of our Belief, but going away without renouncing his own imposture, said, that every night he went by the Spirit to
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>consult the <HI>Sun</HI> for the government of the following day. Finally, all these peoples are of a good nature, nimble and quick of body, and of colour not so tawny and Sun∣burnt as those of <HI>Brasile.</HI> They are of quick apprehension and understanding, and are very expert in their hands for all sort of works. They are naturally sweet and meek, officious and tractable; and they converse familiarly with strangers without any fear. They are every way so docile and teachable, and so little possest with malice, that from hence the easiness to sub∣due them, as well to Laws and policy, as to Christian Religion, may be guessed at.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the great Cordeliere.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Southern <HI>America,</HI> to the East of the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> and as it were from the North to the South, runs and rangeth along a garland of great Mountains more than six hundred Leagues in length, under the name of the <HI>great Cordeliere,</HI> And by a wonderfull work of nature, all
<PB N="12" REF="24"/>the waters, which from thence arise in a∣bundance, on that side of the great Moun∣tains, that look towards the East, do all render themselves into the North-Sea by one only mouth and confluent. But these well-heads, and springs being so many, cannot be yet all discovered: it sufficeth us in this Book to remark the chief ones, and such of them as are famous, by the origine and source of the great River of the <HI>Amamazones,</HI> and of others the most famous, that he receiveth into his channell, to con∣vey them together with himself into the Ocean-Sea. And amongst the longest and greatest of all these Rivers, the Great <HI>Cake∣ta,</HI> the <HI>Putumaye,</HI> and the <HI>Aguarike,</HI> are on the North-side; and the <HI>Madera,</HI> the <HI>Ama∣rumaya,</HI> the <HI>Maragnon,</HI> and the <HI>Curaray,</HI> are on the Southside of the River of the <HI>Ama∣zones.</HI> Which being the only, and the principall object of our Discourse, we will here begin to describe its source, in this Chapter, telling you that it is the most Westward of all the sources, that are to the East of the great <HI>Cordeliere;</HI> that which is furthest off from the Ocean, or <HI>Atlantique</HI>-Sea, and the nearest of any to the Town of <HI>Kyto,</HI> one of the greatest and fairest Cities,
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>not only of the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> but also of any in all <HI>America;</HI> the seat of a Sove∣raign Court, and Capitall of a great Pro∣vince, of three hundred degrees, and ten minutes of Longitude, (counting from the first and fixt Meridian of the Ile of Saint <HI>Michell,</HI> of the <HI>Azores</HI>) and sixteen mi∣nutes only of Latitude meridionale. But for better clearing of this matter yet, we must adde, that between the Town of <HI>Kyto,</HI> &amp; the source of the great River of the <HI>Ama∣zons,</HI> these tops, or risings of the great <HI>Corde∣liere,</HI> that are after mentioned, are interjected.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of the sources of the great River of the Amazones.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Pulcan</HI> and <HI>Guanama</HI> are two Mountains of the great and high <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> di∣stant one from the other little less than two Spanish Leagues, of three hundred degrees, thirty six minutes of Longitude, on the terrestriall Globe; and twenty minutes on∣ly of meridionale or Southern Latitude. They are in the great Province of <HI>Kyto,</HI> of
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>the rich Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> about six Leagues to the Southside of the equinoctiall Line; and eight Leagues to the East of the Town of <HI>Kyto,</HI> the Capitall of that Pro∣vince: and two Lakes, that are at the two foots of these two Mountains, are the re∣nowned sources of the great and famous <HI>A∣mazone.</HI> That of <HI>Pulcan</HI> is the largest, o∣penest, and best discovered; and that of <HI>Guanama</HI> is the deepest and profoundest, and as it were almost covered by a great rock overturned upon it by an Earthquake. But these two spring-heads, the most won∣derfull of all the world, since they give the beginning to the most memorable River of the universall world, run quickly into one, and pass along together the terrible rocks of the <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> rolling their roaring waters over its precipices and fals: from whence this great River coming forth and running alwayes strong, swift, and straight towards the East, receives presently upon his leav∣ing the <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> a marvellous great in∣crease from the <HI>Coca,</HI> the <HI>Payamine,</HI> and the <HI>Napo,</HI> (three considerable Rivers, whereof we shall speak else where) and in short while makes his navigableness like un∣to that of the great Ocean-Sea, as well for
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>the depth of his channell, as for the less ra∣pidness of his currant of water. But this remarkable place, where the River of <HI>Na∣po</HI> enters into that of the <HI>Amazones</HI> (which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call the <HI>Junto</HI> of the Rivers, and we the <HI>conjunction or joyning of the Ri∣vers,</HI> to the same very sense <HI>verbatim</HI>) is about sixty Leagues from the Town of <HI>Ky∣to,</HI> and under the equinoctiall Line. And it was in this place that the adventurous <HI>Francis D'Areillane</HI> that <HI>Spanish</HI> Knight, made build a Vessell, in the which he first navigated, and happily discovered all this great River of the <HI>Amazones.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the length and course of this River.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter that the great <HI>Amazone</HI> hath made his channell like unto that of the greatest Rivers of the world, by the conflux of the foresaid three Rivers, he goes on his way through the vast and fertile fields of <HI>America,</HI> alwayes towards the East, and without longer straying from under the Line, than five or six degrees at the most,
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>on the Southside, or that of the antarctick Pole. Yet drawing his now-slow waters after him, by infinite turnings and windings in plains and fields of so large and great ex∣tent, he casts out his arms on every side to receive the more easily the Rivers which from all parts come unto him, and that with such admirable agreement, that the least of his armes receive alway the least Rivers and Rivulets; and the greater the greater: and if Rivers come to him, that are bigge and made great by a course of more hundreths of Leagues together, he there shuts up all his waters into one channell, to receive those greater worthily, and as it were with a great∣er state and magnificence. As for his length from his source to his mouth at the <HI>Atlantique</HI>-Sea, following the course of his wide channell, it is diversly reported. The fore-mentioned <HI>Areillane</HI> makes it of eigh∣teen hundred, and Father <HI>D' Acogna</HI> of one thousand two hundred seventy six <HI>Spanish</HI> Leagues, according to the justest measures that we could gather from the Relations of this Author, who contradicts himself often through forgetfulness, and not taking heed. Now the sparingest reckoning of Father <HI>D' Acogna,</HI> being modester than that of
<PB N="17" REF="26"/><HI>Areillane,</HI> seems to me to have more ap∣pearances of the truth in it; because the distance of the mountains of <HI>Pulcan,</HI> and <HI>Guanama</HI> (where the Sources of this great River are) in a streight line unto <HI>Zaparara,</HI> which is the Easterliest Cape, at which he ends his course, is but of six hundred four∣ty leagues of the same sort, according to my Geographick Tables or Mappes, and the methods of the eighth Book of my Ge∣ometricall Theorems. But because this di∣stance in a streight line, appears to me to be yet too farre different from the foresaid length of one thousand two hundred seventy six leagues; I could easily perswade my self, that either the Southern longitude of <HI>America</HI> were greater; or that the leagues of this <HI>Spanish</HI> Father Jesuit should be no o∣ther but <HI>Celtiberian-Spanish</HI> leagues, or <HI>Bis∣cay leagues,</HI> like unto our French-sea-leagues, the which amounting but to twenty, for every degree of a great circle, would give us seven hundred thirty two leagues in a right or streight line, for the same distance be∣tween the Sources of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and the extremity of his mouth, or upshutting.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of the Longitudes, Latitudes, and Measures observed in this great River.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the design we have to set down in this place, and all along, the <HI>distances,</HI> and their <HI>latitudes,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have observed <HI>an.</HI> one thousand six hundred thirty nine, alongst the River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> report∣ed by <HI>D' Acogna</HI> aforesaid, delegated by King <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth to this charge: we have also resolved to adde the <HI>longitudes,</HI> which we have adjusted as much as is possi∣ble from confusion and uncertainty; and this as well for the curiosity of such as love Ge∣ography; as for the help of these Authours, that would make new Cartes of these pla∣ces. But going back to the end of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Chapter, we shall continue the course of this great River in this manner.</P>
<P>From the mouth of <HI>Napo,</HI> which is on the South of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> to <HI>Anete,</HI> are fourty seven leagues. This place of <HI>Anete</HI> is yet under the line, and on the South-side of the great River.</P>
<P>From <HI>Anete</HI> to the <HI>Agarico,</HI> are eighteen

<P>From <HI>Rio-negro</HI> then unto the <HI>Madera</HI> are four leagues; the mouth of this River being on the South of the <HI>Amazone.</HI></P>

<P>From the <HI>Tapayse</HI> to the <HI>Coropatube,</HI> four∣ty leagues; the mouth of which River is on the North-side of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Coropatube</HI> to the Fort of the <HI>Destierro,</HI> fifty four leagues; which Forte∣resse is also on the North-side of the great River.</P>
<P>From the foresaid Fort to the <HI>Ginipape,</HI> six leagues; the mouth of which River is on the North-side also, having two degrees of Southern latitude, and three hundred thirty one degrees and fifty minutes of lon∣gitude. And about two leagues under this <HI>Ginipape</HI> towards the Sea, the great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> begins to open himself by little and little towards his great Mouth, or place of discharge into the Sea.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
<P>From the <HI>Ginipape</HI> to the <HI>Paranaybe,</HI> ten leagues, the mouth of which River is on the South side of the <HI>Amazone.</HI></P>

<P>From the <HI>Pacache</HI> to <HI>Commuta,</HI> fourty leagues. This place is also on the South-side of the <HI>Amazone.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Commuta</HI> to <HI>Para,</HI> thirty leagues. This Town is also on the South-banke of the great mouth of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> having one degree and thirty minutes of South la∣titude.</P>
<P>From <HI>Para</HI> to the Ile of the <HI>Sun,</HI> four∣teen leagues. This Ile is also near to the same South-banke.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of the bredth, and of the Iles of this great River.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the great <HI>Amazone</HI> is wonderfull for its length, it is no lesse admirable for its bredth, and its Ilands. The one is alwaies of two, three, or four leagues broad, but never so little as of one only: the others are innumerable, and so great, that their compasse is of five, or of ten, and sometimes of twenty; yea, and more than of an hun∣dred
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>leagues sometimes, as is that of the <HI>To∣pinambes.</HI> There is a great number also of very little ones, in which the Natives make their Burial-places, having their Dwellings in the others, that are greater. But the greater part of these Iles, and sometimes the greatest of them, are in part at least drowned and overflowed every year by the inundations of that River, but so fatned thereafter with the mud, that he scatters o∣ver them behind him, that they are there∣by exceeding fertile, yielding every year without any intermissions of rest, their or∣dinary crops, which are of <HI>Maze, Yoca,</HI> and <HI>Mandioca;</HI> which yeeld the common food for all <HI>America,</HI> where it is in great abun∣dance all along the great River of the <HI>Ama∣zone.</HI> But to help the inconveniences of overflowing, they make under-ground Cel∣lers, Granaries, or Caves well cover'd, where they keep their <HI>Maze,</HI> (which is their wheat) without impairement; and the <HI>Yo∣ca</HI> (which is a root) whereof they make their <HI>Casabe,</HI> which is the ordinary, and lesse finish bread of all <HI>Brasile,</HI> and of all that New-world. Returning then to the wonders of the large Channell of this great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> we shall end this

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Of its Depth, and Navigation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEeing the great and wonderfull Channell of the renowned River of the <HI>Ama∣zones,</HI> as a certain long and vast Sea of sweet waters, receives so many great, broad, and deep Rivers, we must not think it strange, if the depth of his bed equall often∣times the Abysses of the Ocean its self. This is for the most part, from his beginning unto <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> of eight, twelve, and of twenty <HI>fathomes;</HI> and from <HI>Rio-negro</HI> down∣wards to the Ocean, of thirty, fourty, and sometimes without ground, and unfathom∣able, according to the relations of all that

But this marvellous ad∣vantage his depth hath beyond others singu∣lar, that for the most part they are alike, along the bankes and sides, as they are in the midst of this large Channell of the great <HI>Amazone:</HI> whence it follows, that his Na∣vigablenesse, and the fitnesse for commerce of this great River, is open and sufficient enough for the greatest Navies, of the greatest number, of the greatest burthen; which may not only sail up all along him to his first rise in order of Battell, and ready for fight; but also put to Land easily, and apply to the shore, without any fear of rocks, or sands. And Providence having purpo∣sed every way to render all these wonders yet more considerable, hath led the waters of this famous River alwaies from West to East, and near unto the <HI>Aequator,</HI> to the end, that as <HI>Navale</HI> Armies might easily come down from his very source to his mouth, carryed by the sweet force and strength of his current, and streame; so they might also as easily go up from his mouth and first entrance unto his very source, against the stream of his deep wa∣ters, by a favourable and continual winde, which blows there in a good gale perpetual∣ly,
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>and without ceasing, from East to West, either all the day long, or at lest three or four hours of it together, because of the Diurnall motion either of the Earth, or of the first moveable Heaven, or Orbe: so that on the North-sea, from the <HI>Canary</HI> I∣lands, to those of the <HI>Canibal's;</HI> and on the South-sea, from <HI>New-Spain,</HI> unto the <HI>Philippine</HI> Iles; as also all along the coast of <HI>Paria</HI> and <HI>Guiana,</HI> as one goes from the North-cape, to the Cape of <HI>Sailes,</HI> the same East-wind is alwaies found to be on wing, and in his reign, without ceasing. But as in those other parts above-named, it is im∣possible for Ships to take the same waies back again, for returning to the places from whence they came, that they held in coming from them, so long as their Sailes must be fill'd with those East-windes; so this great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> hath this particular advantage beyond them, that whole <HI>Arma∣does</HI> can go from East to West, and from West to East, alwaies under the line, and the same way both of going and coming, and as the same time.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Thracian</HI> and <HI>Cimmerian Bosphores,</HI> or <HI>Ox-swim-bredths</HI> were never so fa∣mous in ages past, as the <HI>Amazonian Bos∣phore</HI> will be renowned in times to come, in all apperance. This one strange <HI>Strait</HI> of this River (richer in one day, than are at present both the Straits of <HI>Hellespont,</HI> and of <HI>Elsenore</HI>) shuts up in one channell scarcely a thousand paces broad, or an Italian mile, the whole great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> proud of the spoiles of so many, and great, and long Rivers; and highly puft up for his course of more than nine hundred sixty leagues, through Plaines and Valleys the fertilest in the whole world; and triumph∣ing in all the waters, that rise from the East of the great <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> from the Town of <HI>Popayan</HI> to that of <HI>Plata,</HI> which is the space of five hundred leagues. This wonderfull <HI>Bosphore,</HI> or <HI>Ox-passe,</HI> which Providence hath reserved to be one day the Key of the richest Trade in the world, and of the great∣est Kingdom that is in one only Continent,
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>hath three hundred twenty eight degrees, and fifty minutes of longitude, and two degrees and fourty minutes of North-lati∣tude, and is three hundred leagues from the North sea, following the course of turning and windings of this great River unto <HI>Za∣parara;</HI> however Father <HI>D' Acogna</HI> (often enough variable in his measures) carry sometimes this distance of the <HI>Bosphore</HI> from the Sea, unto the length of three hundred sixty leagues. But untill the longitude of this great part of <HI>America</HI> be better obser∣ved, I intend alwaies to follow the least mea∣sures of distances. Now this one only and famous <HI>Strait</HI> of the great River of the <HI>A∣mazones,</HI> is yet further considerable for this, that the flowing of the great Seas is here easily perceived, offering a marvellous advantage to the commerce of this Rivers Navigation, by the ebbing, and flowing of the Ocean.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>Of the first three Rivers, that enter into that of the</HI> Amazones.</HEAD>
<P>AFter that we have thus summarily de∣scribed the course of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> we will return to his be∣ginning, to handle anew the things that are without, and adjacent to it. But I could wish that Father <HI>Acogna,</HI> the Authour and eye-witnesse of a part of these relations,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>were more cleanly and understandable in them. For not having been able to find either cartes, or books to help my cares that I have to unfold these ambiguities, I my self therefore rest not satisfied in this behalf with mine own work. Without staying therefore to censure a Person of his Noble∣nesse and merit, by reasons which I might, and the curious may themselves perceive in his writings, I shall take me to my Subject, and tell you, that from the Town of <HI>Cofana</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kixo,</HI> to the East of the <HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> and to the North of the line, comes forth the <HI>Coca,</HI> a navigable Ri∣ver, which quickly renders himself on the North-side into the beginnings of the great River of the <HI>Amazones;</HI> which as yet in these parts having his stream too rapid and violent, hath not therefore at this place so convenient a navigation himself, as other Rivers, that enter into his large bed on the side of the Antarctique or South Pole. The first whereof passing on as it were about three daies journeys from the City of <HI>A∣vila</HI> of the same Province of the <HI>Kixos,</HI> renders himself in short while, and under the name of <HI>Payamino,</HI> into the great River, on the South-side thereof, and below the
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>entrance of the <HI>Coca,</HI> though the distance is not known, nor set down. But about eighteen leagues from the Town of <HI>Kito,</HI> beyond the <HI>Andes</HI> of the great <HI>Cordelier,</HI> is the mount <HI>Antezame</HI> on the South-side of the line; from the foot of which the River of <HI>Napo</HI> coming forth, and running a∣mongst the Rocks without being navigable untill he come to a Port, or Haven of the same name well nigh unto <HI>Archidona,</HI> he be∣comes yet more easie to be navigated four leagues beneath that, as well for the great∣nesse of his Channell, as for the lesse rapid∣nesse and violence of his stream: and pur∣suing in this condition his way to great Ri∣ver, he enters thereinto about thirty leagues only from <HI>Archidona.</HI> But concerning the mouth of this River, you may look the seventh Chapter of this Book; unto which I will here adde, that the foresaid <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Napo,</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> have an habitation, is the best embarquing place, for all those that from the Province of <HI>Kito,</HI> would sail or go into the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> And as to this pleasant fair, and great enough Ri∣ver of <HI>Napo,</HI> it hath this prerogative be∣yond others, to rolle alongst with him a∣amongst the sands of his current, good

<P>HAving begun to shew you before, the divers Havens or embarquing places, by which the great and rich Province of <HI>Kyto</HI> may enter into the commerce of the great River of <HI>Amazone;</HI> we will now fol∣low the like way, be the other Rivers that come from the North-side, and give the like advantages to the rich Regions of the <HI>Popayan,</HI> and of the Kingdom of new <HI>Gran∣ado:</HI> whereof the first are the <HI>Aguarique,</HI> and the <HI>Putomaya,</HI> taking their begin∣nings in the <HI>Putomaya,</HI> taking their begin∣nings in the great mountaines of the <HI>Cor∣delier,</HI> both of them well nigh to the Town
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>of <HI>Pasto</HI> of the Government of <HI>Popayan,</HI> having three hundred and one degrees, and thirty minutes of longitude, and one de∣gree only of North latitude. But though both these Rivers have their course from West to East; yet that of the <HI>Aguarique,</HI> which is the Southerliest, comes first to the great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> in the Pro∣vince of the <HI>Chevelues,</HI> or long-hair'd peo∣ple; and that after a course of more than an hundred leagues (all along Navigable) through happy, fertile, and well-inhabited Regions, as all the rest of the Realm of the great <HI>Amazone</HI> is. Now the mouth of this considerable River, (the Name where∣of is, <HI>The River of Gold,</HI> because he draws much of it along his bank-sides) is on the North-side of the great River of the <HI>Ama∣zones,</HI> and about an hundred seventeen leagues from his own Sources and Spring-heads, and likewise under the line. But the River of <HI>Putomaya</HI> taking a course much more stragling and wandring, and water∣ing a good many more Nations than the o∣ther, makes also hereby his Navigation more considerable, and of greater Portati∣on by a course of farre greater extent, and a greater number of Rivers, that on all sides
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>arrive unto him also. And after he hath fertilized so many great champain Coun∣tries by the fresh vapours of his waters, and by his ordinary overflowings, as all Rivers of <HI>America</HI> do; he opens and enlarges himself near unto a leagues bredth at his entry into the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and about four hundred fifty three leagues from his own Sources, or Well-heads. Now the mouth of this River of <HI>Putomaya,</HI> which carryes along with him gold also, as most others do; is on the North-side of the great River, and hath two degrees and thirty minutes of Southern latitude, having runne under the line a great deal more than the half of his course, and under the same measured (in his bankes and windings at least) the space and length of more than three hundred fifty leagues. Thus the commerce of the great River of the <HI>A∣mazones</HI> will in time coming receive no lesse enlargement by the happy Naviga∣tions of the <HI>Aguarique,</HI> and of the <HI>Puto∣maya,</HI> than by other great and famous Rivers (which promise him the same encrease) as well for the richesse and fer∣tile Countries of the Town of <HI>Pasto,</HI> as for the situation of the same, which is

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>Of the great</HI> Caketa, <HI>a considerable Ri∣ver.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe third and last River, which from the North, and from the mountains of the <HI>Cordelier,</HI> comes into the great Ri∣ver of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> goes under the name of <HI>The great Caketa;</HI> and is acknowledged and celebrated for the greatest of all the Rivers in <HI>America,</HI> next to the great <HI>Ama∣zone.</HI> The Kingdom of new <HI>Granado</HI> glo∣ries in its birth, and the Valley of <HI>Nicao</HI> of the Province of <HI>Popayan,</HI> is the famous place of his Source, which hath two de∣grees and thirty minutes of North-latitude, and three hundred and three degrees, and fourty minutes of longitude, on the ter∣restrial Globe. This great River so much renown'd, and yet so little known to this day by Geographers, receives presently a marvellous increase of waters, which de∣scend in great abundance from the great
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>mountains of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Bogota;</HI> and taking his way from West to East, almost every where parallell to the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> he insensibly draws near to runne under the line, continuing thus his course untill about at one degree of North-latitude, and three hundred eighteen degrees of longitude, he divides his large and magnificent Chan∣nell into <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> and <HI>Rio-grand;</HI> i. e. into the Black River and the great River. But the great <HI>Caketa</HI> is so wonderfull at this place, that this division hinders him not to render himself on the one side into the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> by the first of his branches, and by an entry of more than one league and an half broad; nor to keep for a long time the colour of his own pleasant and deep waters, untill that the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> all gathered up into one great bed, for re∣ceiving of him, deface this appearance of the <HI>Caketaes</HI> waters, but not untill after a combate between them, for the space of twelve leagues length. As for his other branch (which I take to be the great River of the <HI>Orenoc,</HI> contrary to the opinions of Father <HI>D' Acogna,</HI> because I see no other River from the <HI>Cape of the Sailes</HI> to the Cape of the North, that can be attributed
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>to him) it turns its course towards the North, and renders himself into the North-Sea by a mouth worthy of his greatness and magnificence. But because the <HI>Orenos</HI> (as other Rivers of <HI>Guyana</HI> have) hath <HI>leaps</HI> and <HI>fals</HI> that are high and steep, amongst the rocks, that he passeth through; (fol∣lowing here the relations of <HI>Diego d' Ordas,</HI> of <HI>Alphonso de Herrera,</HI> and of <HI>Anthony de Berreo,</HI> who were amongst the first of such as navigated it) neither the commerce of the great <HI>Caketa,</HI> nor that of the great <HI>A∣mazone,</HI> can ever be hindred on this behalf, as Father <HI>D'Acogna</HI> apprehends, ground∣ing himself on the passage of <HI>Lopez D'A∣guirre,</HI> which he held from the River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> to the North Sea by this track or way: but not knowing, that <HI>Lopez</HI> had not light Boats, that can pass over all, and shoot such fals, (as Oares do <HI>London</HI>-Bridge at a low water) or that he made draw them alongst with him by land (as o∣ther <HI>Spaniards</HI> also did before him) from the beginning of the leap or fall of the River <HI>Orenoc,</HI> to the end of it, which is at least an hundred Leagues distant from his mouth, whereby he enters into the great Ocean. Returning therefore to the great <HI>Caketa,</HI> we
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>shall have done with him, and this Chap∣ter, if we tell you, that he receives an infi∣nitie of other Rivers; that he waters sundry rich Provinces, and many very warlike Nations; that his overflowings makes on all sides many great Lakes, as is usuall in all other Rivers of <HI>America;</HI> that now and then he sends some <HI>arms</HI> or <HI>branches</HI> into the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> which are equall to some good Rivers in other places: that his mouth of the <HI>Orenoc</HI> hath nine degrees of North-latitude, and three hundred twenty one de∣grees and twenty minutes of Longitude: and that his mouth of <HI>Rio-negro</HI> (so called from the <HI>depth</HI> of his pure-clear waters, whereby they seem black) hath four de∣grees of South-latitude, and three hundred twenty two degrees, and twenty minutes of longitude, on the North-side of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> about some seven hundred eighty eight Leagues from his first sources, the same distance, that the <HI>Ama∣zone</HI> hath from this place to his head; as is before said towards the end of Chapter the ninth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>Of the River of</HI> Maragnon.</HEAD>
<P>ONe of the principall and most famous Rivers, that the <HI>Andes</HI> of the <HI>Cor∣deliere</HI> send forth towards the South of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> is without all doubt the <HI>Maragnon,</HI> as well for the rich and noble Province, whence he takes his beginning, as for the renown of his name, whereby he is so celebrious in the Histories of this New-world: forasmuch as <HI>Joseph Acosta,</HI> and <HI>Antony</HI> of <HI>Herrera,</HI> give this name often both to the great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> it self, and to the River of the <HI>Orenoc;</HI> and the <HI>Portuguaise</HI> of <HI>Brasile</HI> give the same name also to another considerable enough River, which looseth himself in a great <HI>Bay,</HI> or <HI>gulph,</HI> which they call the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> in the North-most Government of the Kingdome of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> called for this same cause by that title also. But to the end that the diversity of so many Rivers, and places called by this name, may not beget confu∣sion in my Geography; I shall for ever leave it to this one alone, and famous River, that
<PB N="44" REF="40"/>I now speak of, the name of <HI>Maragnon;</HI> a River well known from all Antiquity in the great Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> by this name. He hath this singular in the way of his course, that whereas he takes his beginnings to the West of the great Mountains of the <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> and not from its self, yet he ceases not to pass through them, and to draw all his deep waters towards the East of <HI>A∣merica.</HI> His famous sources honour the Lake of <HI>Boubon</HI> with the prerogative of his rise. This Lake is in the Countries of <HI>Guanuco,</HI> a Colony of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and in the Province of <HI>Lima,</HI> the richest and first of all the Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> the most rich place of all the world. Its longitude is of three-hundred and two degrees, and thirty minutes, on the terrestriall Globe; and his latitude of ten degrees, and four minutes, antarctick or meridionall; and his distance from the royall Town of <HI>Lima,</HI> forty Leagues. So this famous River of <HI>Marag∣non</HI> coming forth of this foresaid Lake, waters the long and fertile Valley of <HI>Saussa,</HI> and cutting or crossing the Kings high way beween the Towns of <HI>Guanuco,</HI> and <HI>Gua∣mangue,</HI> under Bridges made of cords and wood with a marvellous artifice, he passes
<PB N="45" REF="40"/>through the whole <HI>Andes</HI> of the <HI>Cordeliere;</HI> from whence coming out again at last much more mighty than he was, by the continu∣all confluence of Rivers, that on all sides arrive unto him, he passes along the Pro∣vince of <HI>Mayn</HI> to the East of the <HI>Cordeliere;</HI> and after his having saluted as it were, the Town of St. <HI>James of the Mountains,</HI> still made broader, deeper, and very swift and rapid in currant, he afterwards spreads him∣self abroad at pleasure and with more liber∣ty in diverse fair Provinces, and amongst Nations puissant and warlike. In end fol∣lowing his course, still growing bigger, and more impetuous and rapide, than one would think that he could be navigable, he powres out all his waters into the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> at the Southside thereof, ha∣ving four degrees of Southern latitude at that place; and three hundred and seven degrees, and fifty minutes of Longitude; and about two hundred fifty seven Leagues from the sources of the great River of the <HI>Amazones.</HI> His own length is about three hundred Leagues, reckoning by his banks; and as for his navigation which I take, ought not to be reckoned further, than after that he hath passed the <HI>Andes,</HI> it will not fail one
<PB N="46" REF="41"/>day to bring the greatest riches of all <HI>Peru,</HI> to the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> for the same reasons, that we have heretofore men∣tioned, and in the Chapter of the <HI>Bosphore,</HI> by name.</P>

But the <HI>Madera</HI> without contradiction, is the last River, that comes from the Southside, and from the <HI>Andes</HI> of the great <HI>Cordeliere,</HI> to pay his tribute to the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> And as he is remotest in his sources, so he is the long∣est, having a course of about seven hun∣dred Leagues. He wades inestimable fields, and infinite Nations, and as it were jealous of the glory of his ending, he seems as it were upon design to shun rencountring with the Lake of <HI>Xaraya,</HI> the originall of the great River of <HI>Plata,</HI> leaving it upon his Eastside
<PB N="48" REF="42"/>only fifty Leagues distant from him; that he might with more honour loose his name and waters in the great, and more renown∣ed River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and that by an entry, that is worthy of his own greatness, at three degrees and forty minutes of South-latitude; and three hundred twenty four degrees of longitude; and eight hundred thirty two Leagues from the sources of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> As to the birth of the <HI>Madera,</HI> whereof we shall speak, (and to which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave this name, be∣cause of the trees, that he brought down in∣to his mouth at that time when they disco∣vered him) according to the best opinion, it is in the most rich and opulent Province of <HI>Plata</HI> in the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> to the East of the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> under the twenty first degree of South-latitude, and three hundred and thirteenth of Longi∣tude. The <HI>Topinambians</HI> vaunt, that they have come down all the length of it, as we shall declare hereafter; and they tell won∣ders of its greatness, as also of other Rivers, that on every side augment it.

It is on the North-side, and begins from the River of the <HI>Aguarick,</HI> and being of a good breadth, extends it self in length more than one hundred eighty Leagues alway upon the side of the <HI>Ama∣zone.</HI> Its Rivers roll gold, its fields are all fertile, and the yearly inundations make Lakes in it in great abundance. This Na∣tion is one of the valiantest in all <HI>America;</HI> it hath alwayes resisted all sallyes of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and by the death of <HI>Johne de Palacios,</HI> it put a sudden stop to their bold∣ness. As well the men as the women wear their hair long even unto their girding∣place; whence they were presently called the <HI>Chevelues,</HI> or <HI>long-haired</HI> people, great and fair; as also a River was called, that
<PB N="53" REF="44"/>runs through the midst of this Province, and loseth himself in the great <HI>Amazone;</HI> on the mouth of which forty <HI>Portuguais</HI> and three hundred <HI>Brasilians</HI> encamped for ele∣ven moneths the year 1638, as we shall de∣clare afterwards. But the greatest and the best of all the Provinces, that lie costing on the River <HI>Amazone,</HI> is that of the <HI>Homa∣gues:</HI> whose length is two hundred Leagues, and his habitations so frequent, that scarce∣ly one is out of sight, when another appears. But its breadth appears not to be great, be∣cause it exceeds not the extent of such arms as the <HI>Amazone</HI> casts out that way. All the Towns and Villages are in great Ilands, and in great number: and the beginning of this long Province on the West side is a∣bout three hundred seventeen Leagues from the sources of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> Almost in the midst of it is the greatest and best ha∣bitation of the <HI>Homagues,</HI> whereof we have spoken in the ninth Chapter; as also of a∣nother mighty habitation, consisting of an infinitie of houses after their fashion, seated in an advantageous place; filled with the valiantest men and best Warriors, and fur∣nished with all sorts of Arms and Munition of Warre; and that because, this, place,
<PB N="54" REF="45"/>being the last of all the Province on the East side, it is Frontier to many warlike peo∣ples, against whom the <HI>Homagues</HI> fight of∣ten, and almost without ceasing. This Nation is the most reasonable, and the best governed of all others of this discovery; and that by the benefit of such amongst them, as have frequented the <HI>Kixes</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> from whence they were chased through sear of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that used them as slaves. They are all honestly clothed as well men as wo∣men; who make not only clothing for themselves of Cotton, which they have there in abundance; but also to traffique with in other Countries, where their work∣manships are sought after for their fineness and delicacy. These Stuffs are very plea∣sant, woven of diverse colours, or else paint∣ed with great skill. They are so subject and obedient to their <HI>Caciques,</HI> or <HI>Lords,</HI> that they presently do any thing upon a word speaking. They have all their heads flat out of a contrivance and are they use for it when they are born. They have conti∣nuall Warres on both sides of the River with the <HI>Savages,</HI> who on the South side are the <HI>Curines,</HI> so numerous, that they not only defend themselves from the <HI>Homa∣gues,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="45"/>but also from other Nations, that are further from them, yet fight with them daily. And on the North side are the <HI>Te∣cunes,</HI> no less valiant and numerous than the <HI>Curines,</HI> seeing as they, they make al∣so Warres upon other Nations, that are fur∣ther off from them, than the <HI>Homagues.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. <HI>Of the condition of slaves; and of neigh∣bouring Nations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALl the <HI>Indians</HI> of the great Realm of the <HI>Amazone</HI> (as we have said else∣where) are served only with slaves: and the only penalty of the vanquished prisoner, is all brought to this sad debt towards the victorious enemy, that took him in Warre. But the <HI>Homagues</HI> are so generous towards such as have been overcome, more by an evil fortune, or over-ruling power from heaven, than by any feebleness that was in themselves, that they use them very gent∣ly, make them sometimes eat with them∣selves, and never suffer them to be sold to who will give most. This were highly to
<PB N="56" REF="46"/>offend them, but to demand such things of them; as the <HI>Portuguais</HI> often had experi∣ence, who coming down the great River <HI>Anno</HI> 1639, arrived one day amongst others at an habitation of these <HI>Homagues:</HI> who received them in peace, and with great joy, and very liberally presented them with any thing they stood in need of. They sold them <HI>Stuffes,</HI> also <HI>Canoes</HI> or Boats, that were very light: but never any slaves, not enduring so much as to hear of it. Whence it follows, that these peoples replenished with so much sweetness and modesty, would easily enough receive the rule of a moderate Prince, and the knowledge of the true Re∣ligion. But that we may lightly pass over the Nations that are on the one side, and the other of the Province of <HI>Homague;</HI> we shall only say, that to the North of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> the <HI>Yorunes,</HI> and the <HI>Paryanes,</HI> and then the <HI>Atoyes,</HI> and the <HI>Cunes;</HI> and finally the <HI>Homaguazietes</HI> (that is, the true <HI>Homagues,</HI> the valiantest of these Nations, and as it were the superiours to the others) dwell alongst the vast fields of both the banks of <HI>Putumaya,</HI> all along up towards its source, So for the South side of the Province of <HI>Homague,</HI> the <HI>Tipunes,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="46"/>and the <HI>Guanares,</HI> and then the <HI>Ozoanes,</HI> and the <HI>Nahones;</HI> and after them the <HI>Ca∣nomanes</HI> and the <HI>Marianes,</HI> possesse the large Regions between the <HI>Maragnon</HI> and the <HI>Amarumaya,</HI> from the mouth of the <HI>Yet as</HI> to the Source of the same. But all these Nations are so valourous, especially those that are furthest off, and that are at the be∣ginning of the River <HI>Putumaya,</HI> that often∣times the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the Province of <HI>Ky∣to,</HI> and of <HI>Popayan,</HI> have been repulsed by them through force of Armes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXII.</HI> Of the Province of <HI>Corosirare,</HI> and of the Neighbouring Nations.</HEAD>
<P>BEtween the end of the Province of <HI>Ho∣mague,</HI> and the beginning of that of <HI>Corosirare,</HI> the two bankes of the great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> are possessed for fifty three leagues space by the <HI>Cacygares</HI> and <HI>Tucuries</HI> on the South-side, and in part on the <HI>Amarumaya;</HI> and on the North∣side, by the <HI>Curis,</HI> and the <HI>Guayrabes.</HI> The Habitations of all which Peoples are
<PB N="58" REF="47"/>remote from the sides of the River, for fear of the <HI>Homagues.</HI> But the Nation <HI>Corosirare,</HI> that dwell to the South of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> begins at <HI>The Village of Gold,</HI> and ends not till after eighty leagues in length down the great River. Its Grounds and Fields are higher than ordinary; and the Habitations of this Province are so fre∣quent, that oftentimes for four leagues to∣gether, and sometimes for six, one can see nothing else. This people, though Sa∣vage, yet wants neither policy, not good conduct of their affairs; all their Houses are well ordered, and replenished with all sorts of Vivers, and Commodities. They have many Kills or Furnaces, and make all fort of Earthen Vessels, which they sell and traffique by with other Nations; but all by way of Exchange, as all other <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> do. As to that Habitation of this Countrey, which the <HI>Portuguau,</HI> while they went up the great River, <HI>an.</HI> One thousand six hundred thirty eight, called <HI>The Village of Gold,</HI> (whereof we spake also in the ninth Chapter) it was by occasion of a pair of Ear-pendants of fine gold, which they took there from a woman: which were so fine, that the gold was found of
<PB N="59" REF="47"/>one and twenty caracts in the Town of <HI>Ky∣to,</HI> after their arrivall there. But so soon as these Natives of this Village perceived the greedinesse of the Souldiers after or∣naments of gold, they presently thereafter hid all that they had, and no more was seen after that; no not at the return of the same <HI>Portuguais</HI> in <HI>an</HI> One thousand six hundred thirty nine, who could never obtaine but one pair of these Ear-pendants by ex∣change with the <HI>Indians,</HI> which Father <HI>D'Acogna</HI> himself bought, to let them be seen in <HI>Spain.</HI> But the great Nation of the <HI>Suanes,</HI> which extends it self to the great <HI>Caketa,</HI> fills all the Fields that are on the other banke of the North of the great <HI>Amazone:</HI> but with this remarke, that their Plaines are a great deal lower, than the op∣posite Grounds and Fields of the <HI>Corosira∣res;</HI> in whose Province are the Mouthes of the great and fair Rivers of <HI>Tapy</HI> and <HI>Catua,</HI> this last forming and fashioning <HI>Lago-verde,</HI> with the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> And alongst these two Rivers, as one goes up them, dwels the great Nation of the <HI>Pacuanes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. <HI>Of the Gold-Mine of the</HI> Suanes, <HI>and of the Neighbouring Nations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe great Province of <HI>Suane</HI> heretofore mentioned, hath this singular glory amongst all the others, that are honoured by the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> to carry Gold within her bowels. The fa∣mous Mountain that nourisheth in his bo∣some so great a treasure, hath about two degrees of South latitude, and three hun∣dred seventeen degrees of longitude. It is two hundred leagues only distant from the Town of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Thomas,</HI> a Colony of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> in <HI>Orenoc,</HI> and fourty leagues from the <HI>Atlantique</HI> Sea. And the precious Ri∣ver of Gold (for so the Natives of the Countrey call it) which waters its foot, draws abundance of this rich Mettall with him, in form of graines of Corn, and lit∣tle bigger billetts. It presently disburdens its self into the <HI>Yopura,</HI> another consider∣able River, which likewise looseth himself into the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> on the North-side, at three degrees of South
<PB N="61" REF="48"/>latitude, and five hundred eighty four leagues, from the Sources of the great Ri∣ver. Whence it follows that the com∣merce so advantageous of the great <HI>Ama∣zone</HI> with this famous Mountain of <HI>Suane,</HI> is made the more commodious by the Na∣vigation of this River of <HI>Yopura,</HI> by going up him into the River of Gold; and that the ages to come will one day make famous these places with rich Towns and mag∣nifique Inhabitants. For the present, a∣mong all the Peoples of these Countries, the <HI>Managues</HI> are those, that traffique with this Gold, the weight whereof, and its finenesse makes it so perfect, that it is the most excellent of all <HI>America.</HI> The <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> that buy of it, by exchange of other things for it, make of it little long Plates, which they hang at their Noses, and Ears: and this rich Ornament is ordinary and fre∣quent in all these Provinces, according to the report of the Savages. But the Nati∣ons (besides the <HI>Suanes</HI>) that are nearest to the treasures of this rich Mountain, are the <HI>Aguaynes,</HI> the <HI>Mocunes,</HI> the chief of all such as dwell to the East of the <HI>Suanes,</HI> and cultivate the fertile Fields, that are watered by both the Channells of the <HI>Araganatube.</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="49"/>Now all the Plaines of these fertile Regions, as well on the North as on the South-side of the great River of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> where the Province of <HI>Corosirare</HI> is; are the best and manyest, and best disposed to receive all sort of culture, of all <HI>America.</HI> But re∣turning to the Gold-Mine of the Mount of <HI>Suane,</HI> I wonder that neither the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Hordas,</HI> and of <HI>Berreo,</HI> nor the English of <HI>Kemnits,</HI> and of <HI>Ralech</HI> have never met with it, that have searched with so much ruine and calamity to the Natives, alongst the great River of <HI>Orenoc,</HI> the imaginary Treasures of the fabulous rather than fa∣mous <HI>Lagad rado.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. <HI>Of the Province of</HI> Yoriman.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT after the Province of <HI>Corosirare,</HI> as you go down the great <HI>Amazone</HI> on the South-side, is the Province of <HI>Yori∣man,</HI> being but of sixty leagues long, but of such repute amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> of all these Countries, by reason of the strength and valour of its Inhabitants, than the Na∣vy
<PB N="63" REF="49"/>of the <HI>Portuguais</HI> themselves passing a∣long did perceive it. They are of a good stature, of a fair body, and well formed. They are expert in all things they take themselves to, especially in Armes; and go all naked, as well men, as women. They are also so numerous for multitude, that never any saw at one time so many <HI>Bar∣barians</HI> together. It was an infallible token of their great courage, that they went and came (as they did) amidst the Armed Ves∣sels and Ships of Warre of the <HI>Portuguais,</HI> to traffique with them, with extreme assu∣rance of minde. For whilest the <HI>Portu∣guais</HI> going up the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> sail'd along by this Province, every day there came to them above two hundred <HI>Canoes,</HI> full of Women and Children, with Fruits, Fishes, Meales, and other such like Pro∣vision, which they changed with the <HI>Portu∣guais</HI> for <HI>axes</HI> and <HI>knives,</HI> whereof they have great esteem, as all others <HI>Indians</HI> of the new world. The <HI>Yorimans</HI> inhabite not only the main Land of this Province, but fill also the great Iles that the great <HI>Amazone</HI> makes by sundry of his Armes stretched forth. The first Village of this Warlike Nation, is on the mouth of a
<PB N="64" REF="50"/>Christalline River, which must be strong, and come very farre considering the force, wherewith he pusheth the deep waters of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> But the notablest of their Habitations, is the greatest of any that lie on the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> containing more a good deal on the banke of that River, than a good league: and in every of its Houses, four or five Familes, and sometimes more; whereby easily may be gathered the great number of the Inhabitants of this long Town, whereof we spake also in the ninth Chapter of this Book. It was in this place, so abounding with all things, that the Fleet of the <HI>Portuguais</HI> stay'd five or six daies at its return, after it had gone up the River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> before with good suc∣cesse, as shall be afterwards related. Not one of so numerous a people fled from his House for fear of their arrivall; but the whole Fleet got freely from them, all that they stood in need of; and because the Na∣vy was near an end of all its Provisions, it got from their bounty five hundred Sacks of the Meale of <HI>Mandioqua,</HI> which sufficed it for the whole rest of its Voyage. The other Habitations also of this happy Pro∣vince of <HI>Yoriman,</HI> are not much inferiour
<PB N="65" REF="50"/>to the former, they are all along very fre∣quent on the firm land; but yet both mightier and more numerous in a great I∣land about thirty leagues lower; where it seemes the principall Forces are of this generous Nation; generous I say, both for its valour, liberality, and numerousnesse of men, that inhabite it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. <HI>Of the Province of</HI> Surina, <HI>and the Neigh∣bouring Nations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt to go from the Province of <HI>Yori∣man,</HI> to that of <HI>Surina,</HI> we must in our passage visit the Nation of the <HI>Cusigua∣res,</HI> that labour the fertile Plaines situ∣ated on the South-banke of the <HI>Amazone;</HI> which in this place receives the plentifull waters of that great River, that gives its own name to this pleasant Province. This renowned River of <HI>Cusiguare,</HI> both for the easinesse of its Navigation (though somewhat hindered now and then by Rocks appearing in it here and there) and for the happinesse of its Fishing, no lesse abound∣ing
<PB N="66" REF="51"/>here, than elsewhere, will be no lesse considerable for the high stature and the great courage of his Nation of the <HI>Motu∣anes,</HI> that cover the first Plaine, that he waters, who by testimony of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that report it, use also long Plates of fine Gold, for Eare and Nose-Pendants; whence it would seem, that they are not farre from the rich Province of the <HI>Plata,</HI> and of <HI>Potosy,</HI> because even to travell up to their Countrey, it takes full two moneths time. But upon the same River, and be∣tween the aforesaid two Nations, the <HI>Cu∣rians,</HI> and the <HI>Catoses,</HI> enjoy likewise the happy fruitfulnesse of so many good Grounds, and so many pleasant Rivers, that on all sides enter into their principall River. Now, as the Province of <HI>Homa∣gue</HI> is celebrated amongst all those of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> for its fine works of Stufles and Cloathes of Cotton of so great varie∣ty; and the Province of <HI>Corosirare</HI> for their excellent Pottery of Vessels of Earth so artificially Painted, and fashioned: so the Province of <HI>Surina</HI> is no lesse commendable for a delicate <HI>houshold-stuffe,</HI> or Utensiles of a marvellous fine artifice. It is on the South of the great River, and to the East
<PB N="67" REF="51"/>of the <HI>Cusiguares:</HI> its Peoples being the <HI>Surines,</HI> and the <HI>Coripunes,</HI> Nations that are the most curious and expert of working in Wood, of any in all <HI>America.</HI> They make Seates and Formes in the fashion of Animals, yet so fine and commodious for the ease of the body, that nothing can be added to their industry. They make also Javelots and Arrows, with so much gen∣tilenesse and elegancy, that all other Nati∣ons seek after them. And the like Images, that they make to the life are so perfect∣ly done in all points, that our best Ingravers and Carvers, could find no other occasion but to learn from them: so that by exchange of so many singular workmanships of so sundry sorts, they daily make their lives more hap∣py by all necessary Commodities, which on all sides come unto them from this rich traffique.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. <HI>Of the Province of</HI> Caribane.</HEAD>
<P>FOr as much as the distances of all these Rivers and Provinces, are just enough set down in the ninth Chapter of this Book; we shall say only of this Province of <HI>Caribane,</HI> that it lies between the <HI>Rio∣negro</HI> and the great <HI>Amazone</HI> in extent of more than an hundred leagues on the banks of either of them. Its Fields and Plaines are higher than that they are subject to the overflowings of these Rivers, or of an e∣quall height unto them; yet fertile and a∣bundant in all things. The River of <HI>Ba∣zurura,</HI> which enters into that of the <HI>Ama∣zones</HI> on the North-side, makes here Lakes and Ilands very pleasant: and the divers Nations of this great Province, are no lesse considerable for the plenteousnesse and fer∣tility of their Countrey, than for the hap∣py condition of their life. Of these, the <HI>Araguananes,</HI> and the <HI>Mariguanes,</HI> are the most Westerly, and lye against the bankes of the <HI>Yoriman,</HI> already mentioned. The <HI>Pogoanes,</HI> and the <HI>Caraganes</HI> are on the
<PB N="69" REF="52"/><HI>Basurura.</HI> The <HI>Comanares</HI> possesse that point which the two Rivers for me at their meeting. The <HI>Tuynamanes,</HI> and the <HI>Co∣marurianes</HI> are on the side of <HI>Rio-negro;</HI> and the others lesse renown'd possesse the Lands that are furthest off from the <HI>Ama∣zone.</HI> All these Peoples are valiant, and use-skilfully the Bow and Arrow. They had from the year One thousand six hun∣dred thirty eight, Knives, and Axes, and other Instruments of Iron, after the fashion of <HI>Europe;</HI> which they gave out to have bought from <HI>Indians</HI> their Neighbours, that were nearer than they to the Sea; and these again from certain persons, that were white of countenance, and cloathed like the <HI>Portuguais,</HI> and armed with Sword and Musket, that dwelt upon the <HI>Atlan∣tique</HI> Sea: which have been without doubt, either <HI>Hollanders,</HI> or English, who have both sailed into the <HI>Orenoc,</HI> and dwelt for some time in the Coasts of <HI>Guyana;</HI> but were at length hostilely chased from thence, by the <HI>Savages;</HI> as also all the <HI>French</HI> were <HI>an.</HI> One thousand six hundred fifty four, from the Ile of <HI>Cayene</HI> in the main Land, and on the same side of the Sea of the North; which is not above two hundred
<PB N="70" REF="53"/>leagues at the most from <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> but reckoning in a streight line, and by the shortest distance. But because nature hath not offered in all the Realm of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> a more favourable situation, than on the point of the <HI>Comanares,</HI> for setling of a Colony of the most considerable ones of any in the world, and which cannot fail one day to be the Seat of an Empire most flourishing, and of great richesse in Trade; we shall therewith finish this Chapter, in telling you, That the Land of it is right upon the bankes of these two great Rivers; that it is also mounted above the height of ordinary inundations; that the surface of it is plain, sweet, and not shrubby: that the Neighbouring Fields abound in graines for necessary Provisions, and in good pasturage for nourishing of Cattle: that Quarries of an excellent Stone for Building, and easie to be cut and hewn, are as near it as Woods, and Trees of a marvellous greatnesse and height, for the conveniency of Buildings and Houses: that the distance of the great <HI>Amazone</HI> from the <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> is not so great, but the fortifications may conveni∣ently and regularly be drawn along on the Land-side, and that the Foussies of these for∣tifications,
<PB N="71" REF="53"/>and this wall being well ordered, may easily be made deep enough, and themselves fill'd by the debordments of the one, or of the other River, at pleasure.</P>

<P>FOllowing the North-side of the great River of the <HI>Amazones, Rio-negro</HI> in∣continent presents its self next after the Province of <HI>Caribane.</HI> His bredth and depth give him the prerogative to be thought the fairest and mightiest River of all that enter into the great <HI>Amazone;</HI> whose mouth being wide a great league and an half, hath four degrees of South latitude, and three hundred twenty two degrees, and twenty minutes of longitude, and seven hundred eighty eight leagues of distance from the Sources of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> The <HI>Amazones</HI> course is here towards the North-east; and that of <HI>Rio-negro</HI> right East, where he enters into the other with such grandure and majesty, that he keeps
<PB N="72" REF="54"/>his waters distinct and separate from the o∣thers, and keeps half of the whole channell to himself for the space of twelve leagues, before the great River (though here all u∣nited into one great bed, to receive him) can overcome the distinctnesse of his wa∣ters, with all the force that he hath. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> first, and after them the <HI>Portu∣gall's,</HI> call'd it <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> because at his mouth, as often also in his channell, his waters appear very black, because indeed they are very clear, and without any colour, but very deep. The Natives also name it for the same reason <HI>Coriguacure,</HI> that is, the <HI>Black River.</HI> But as <HI>Rio-negro</HI> is the great <HI>Caketa</HI> of the sixteenth Chaper of our Book; we shall say no more of it here, nor stay again upon the obscurities of Father <HI>D' Acogna,</HI> which we have there briefly un∣folded; but passe on to the recitall of the Nations that inhabite its bankes, and tell you, That the Province of <HI>Camsuare</HI> is the first that presents its self, having on its South <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> on its East the great <HI>A∣mazone;</HI> and on its North, the great Pro∣vince of <HI>Guyane.</HI> All the Plaines of these Countries are mounted like those of <HI>Cari∣bana,</HI> and not subject to the ordinary over∣flowings,
<PB N="73" REF="54"/>covered with infinite Peoples, and aboundant in all things, especially of Trees of a prodigious height and thicknesse. But amongst the rich Nations of this fertile Province of <HI>Camsuare,</HI> those of the <HI>A∣guares,</HI> of the <HI>Agaypes,</HI> of the <HI>Jamnes,</HI> and of the <HI>Carupatabes,</HI> are not the least considerable, without relating the <HI>Guarana∣casanes,</HI> which make a Province on the be∣ginning of the River of <HI>Orenoc,</HI> as he comes out of the great <HI>Caketa.</HI> See the sixteenth Chapter to make the knowledge of these things lesse confused and imperfect, than they are in Historians and Geographers, who treat of them either too diffusedly in great Books, or too lightly in little Tra∣ctates, seeing also it becomes daily more certain by new and reiterated experiences.</P>

<P>BUt going now to the South-side of the great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> again, we shall find to the East, and following that
<PB N="74" REF="55"/>of <HI>Surina,</HI> the Province of <HI>Cayane,</HI> through which the great and long River of the <HI>Ma∣dera</HI> passeth, and renders it self into the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> And because this River of the <HI>Madera</HI> (which was so called by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> because of the great number of Trees, which it drew alongst with it into its mouth) is one of the principall Rivers of <HI>America,</HI> you shall find the distances and measures, and other circumstances that concern it, in the tenth and eighteenth Chapters of this Book. Now, the Nati∣ons, that Province great enough, contains within its extent, whether lying alongst the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> or in going up the great River of the <HI>Madera,</HI> which the Natives call also <HI>Cayane;</HI> are no lesse happy for the fertility of their fair Fields, and pleasant Rivulets, than other Peoples of all these fertile Countries are. They are of no lesse courage for Warre, not lesse expert in Fights and handling of Armes; they have also the like industry in their handy-works, that serve to make their happinesse of life the more accomplished, by the exchange of them with such commodities as they stand in need of, and they keep likewise in their conduct and Government of affairs, Laws
<PB N="75" REF="55"/>and Customes like unto those, that all o∣ther Provinces of the Realm of the <HI>Ama∣zone</HI> do. But of all these infinite Peoples, that cover so many considerable Plaines and Fields, the <HI>Cayanes,</HI> and the <HI>Anamares</HI> are the most renown'd; and next to these, the <HI>Curares,</HI> and the <HI>Goarinumes;</HI> and after them, the <HI>Abacares,</HI> and the <HI>Oragunagues;</HI> and lastly the <HI>Sabucares,</HI> and the <HI>Urubingues</HI> in going down the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> which yet are the most esteem'd for their curious finenesse of working and making house U∣tensiles.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. <HI>Of the Ile of the</HI> Topinambes.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing the Ile of <HI>Topinambes</HI> is in this place of the River of the <HI>Ama∣zones;</HI> and that it is the greatest of all its Iles, the most renowned Province of any that it waters; we shall say first, that it is of more than sixty leagues of length; and that it is so situated in the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> that it comes nearer to his South-side, than to his North, and that all the distances and measures, that concern it, are in the tenth Chapter of this Book. Secondly, we shall say that it is admirable in fertility of its Grounds, in the beauty of its bankes, in the multitude of its Habitations, whereof the most mighty is in the Eastmost point of it, and hath three degrees of South lati∣tude. Finally, we shall say, that once it was inhabited by its Natives, and originall <HI>Indians,</HI> but that the <HI>Topinambes</HI> coming upon them, chased them from it after sundry Battells, and possest themselves of it with so much glory and reputation for themselves, that the terrour of their names
<PB N="77" REF="56"/>did reach to the neighbouring Nations. Now these <HI>Topinambes</HI> before had inhabited the South coasts of <HI>Brasile,</HI> where not be∣ing able to endure the hard entreaty of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> towards them, after that they had come upon them; they renounced their dear Countrey, and voluntarily a∣bandoned with great resolution more than eighty of their great Bourgades. So they marched in infinite multitudes of men, wo∣men, and children, streight towards the West, and under the same parallell. They crossed by swimming the great Rivers of <HI>Parane,</HI> and of the <HI>Plata,</HI> and leaving on their left hand the Province of <HI>Tucuman,</HI> they in end took up their lodgings on the beginnings of the great River <HI>Made∣ra.</HI> But it befalling one of these <HI>Topi∣nambes</HI> some while after to kill a Cow of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> on the frontier of <HI>Peru,</HI> for which he was rudely chastised; the same fear that carried them too lightly to leave their ancient abode, made them all to dislodge presently from this new one. And to the end to put themselves farre enough from all the Provinces of any neighbourhood with <HI>Peru</HI> possest by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and and to make their Voyage or removall
<PB N="78" REF="57"/>with lesse inconvenience, and the more di∣ligence and circumspection, they embar∣qued themselves in <HI>Canoes,</HI> which they had ready in great number, and so suffered themselves to go at adventure down the stream of <HI>Madera;</HI> and after sundry Moneths navigation, found themselves ar∣rived in the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> and so last∣ly on the bankes of this Ile of <HI>Topinambe,</HI> which they possest by Armes, as hath been said. Now this Warlike and va∣liant Nation entertain'd very courteously the <HI>Portugalls</HI> at their passing them, and received very pleasantly their proposalls that they made, of a mutuall Covenant and Alliance. Which alone might suf∣fice for the conquest of the whole Realm of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> seeing all ply to the on∣ly name of the <HI>Topinambes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. <HI>Of the</HI> Bosphore <HI>of the</HI> Amazone, <HI>and of the Neighbouring Nations to it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOllowing the course of the great <HI>Ama∣zone,</HI> you shall find about fifty four leagues from the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> the <HI>Bosphore</HI> of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> whereby a marvellous effect of the naturall disposition of the ground of these Countries, all the waters of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> and of all the others, that we have described, re∣duce themselves by a sweet violence to the necessity of passing in one only channell so strait, that it is no more than one good quarter of a league. But of this famous <HI>Bosphore,</HI> and all that concerns it, see the tenth and thirteenth Chapters of this Book; that we may passe without hinderance, to the Province of <HI>Mataya,</HI> which lies on the South-side of the great River, from the Province of <HI>Cayane</HI> before-mentioned, un∣to the <HI>Bosphore</HI> of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> The Inhabitants whereof being often beaten by the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> have at last submitted to their yoake, and are now their Tributaries;
<PB N="80" REF="58"/>being bound yearly to furnish them with Stone-axes, to fell their Woods, and great Trees; and with other usefull Instruments of the same matter for labouring and manu∣ring of the Ground; wherein the <HI>Topinam∣bes</HI> are marvellous expert and diligent, as appears in all their plaines and champain Grounds. But on the other North-banke of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> the Province of <HI>A∣panta</HI> presents it self, happy enough in all things. It hath for its confines on the West the Province of <HI>Camsuare;</HI> on the East it passeth the <HI>Bosphore;</HI> and on the North its frontiers on the famous Region of the <HI>A∣mazones;</HI> which I pass over as well as other doubtfull reports, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugalls</HI> have heard of it, as they passed along the great River. The Inhabitants of this Province, next Neighbours to the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> trade in Salt with them, and other Nations, that are farther from them; and Salt is not found but in this place, all alongst the whole course of the great <HI>A∣mazone.</HI> As to the <HI>Apantes,</HI> and <HI>Conures,</HI> they labour their fair Fields, that are wa∣tered by the <HI>Coruris,</HI> which enters present∣ly into the great River, according to the tenth Chapter of this Book; as also the
<PB N="81" REF="58"/><HI>Orixamine,</HI> a River no lesse considerable, of the same North-side and near to the <HI>Bosphore.</HI> They have this singular amongst all the Peoples of that Countrey, that their language is the common language of all <HI>Brasile,</HI> though they be distant from it three hundred leagues. But it may be that the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> in keeping their own, (which was this) have also communicated it to this neighbourhood. Finally, the best counsell that one can give on this behalf to a Prince, or Republique in the progresse of this conquest, is to keep the <HI>Bosphore</HI> in his possession, and the <HI>Topinambes</HI> in amity and confederacy with him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. <HI>Of the Province and River of</HI> Tapayse.</HEAD>
<P>PResently after that the <HI>Amazone</HI> is come forth of the famous <HI>Bosphore,</HI> he betakes himself to his accustomed broad∣nesse again, and begins to mingle the boil∣ings of his waters, with the floods of the high-sea. The first Province that he visits on his South-side, takes its name from the
<PB N="82" REF="59"/>great and broad River of the <HI>Tapayfe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and is no lesse considerable for the abundance of his Fruites and Crops, than for the coura∣gious Nation, that inhabits it: the which is so much the more redoubted to its Neighbours, as that it addes to its valour an art of empoysoning their Arrows. But the Source of this fair and fertile River is unknown to us as yet; and yet its great∣nesse makes it appear, and perswades us, that is it very remote on the South-side, be∣tween the coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> and the great Lake of <HI>Xaraya.</HI> About the year One thousand six hundred thirty, the English went up his broad channell with one Ship, and coming down his bankes again, stayed there some time to sow, and gather Tobac∣co; but being chased from thence with some losse by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they went away without returning. Amongst the Habita∣tions of this Province, the <HI>Portugalls</HI> found one in it, at their return down the great River, of more than one thousand five hundred Families; wherein they were so favourably received by this Nation, how∣ever otherwise both hardy and barbarous, as hath already been said, that all the day long they ceased not to go and sell them
<PB N="83" REF="59"/>Meale, Poullets, Fish, Fruites, and other necessaries: and all with such confidence, that the very women and children never scar'd at their Navy. And yet not con∣tent with these good Offices (as it is the nature of valiant people, to be alivaies ge∣nerous too) they offered moreover to all the <HI>Portugalls</HI> there, if they would but leave their own Countrey, and come and live with them, to serve them in peace, and with a good will, and nourish them all their life time. As to the measures and distan∣ces of the deep and broad mouth of the River of <HI>Tapayse,</HI> you may find them in the tenth Chapter of this Book: and its length cannot well be thought lesse, than from three towards four hundred leagues; whence will follow, that he must receive many others into his bed, to become so great and broad as he is: and that the Pro∣vinces and Nations neighbouring upon him, must be very many, abundant, and fertile.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. <HI>Of the rich and great Province of</HI> Coropa.</HEAD>
<P>BUt following of the River of the <HI>A∣mazones,</HI> and on the North-side, you finde after the Province of <HI>Apanta,</HI> that of <HI>Coropa,</HI> which extends its limits to the River of <HI>Genipapa,</HI> the mouth of which is an hundred fourty leagues from the <HI>Bosphore,</HI> according to the tenth Chapter of this Book, which sets down all the rest of its measure also. This Province hath the name from the River of <HI>Coropatube;</HI> be∣cause the name of <HI>Tube</HI> in <HI>America</HI> lan∣guage, signifies nothing else but <HI>a River.</HI> The Province is almost in the midst of the Rivers length; and a Village of the same name is upon its entry into the great <HI>Ama∣zone;</HI> which is in peace, and under the o∣beisance of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Brasile.</HI> But this River is not so abun∣dant in its waters, as in its richesse, if the Natives abuse not themselves in assuring us of four marvellous Mountaines, that make it considerable, by the nearnesse of the pre∣cious Mines, that they contain in them∣selves.
<PB N="85" REF="60"/>The first is <HI>Yaguare,</HI> that contain∣eth Gold; the second, <HI>Picore,</HI> that offereth Silver, the third presents Sulphure; the fourth is <HI>Paragache,</HI> which so shines by Sunne and Moon-light, that it seemes to be wrought as with enammell, with sundry sorts of precious Stones. All these rich Mountains are under the line, and about an hundred leagues only from <HI>Cayene,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> have had Colonies. But the commerce of them will be more opened, and more commodious, by the navigation of the River of <HI>Coropa,</HI> because about six daies journeys from the same Village, that carryes its name, <HI>Coropa</HI> receives another little River coming from the Mount <HI>Yaguare,</HI> that brings with it abundance of Gold, in forme of graines and billetts. And as for assurances of the Mine of Silver of the Mountain of <HI>Picora,</HI> they may be found from the consequence of the relations of the same <HI>Savages;</HI> who give out with one voice, That they have often drawn out white Mettall of that Mountain, whereof they once made Axes, and Knives; but that because of its softnesse, they left it off, as unprofitable, and of no use. But in the same Province of <HI>Coropa,</HI> on the North∣bank
<PB N="86" REF="61"/>of the great River, and six leagues before you come to that of <HI>Genipape,</HI> is the Fort of the <HI>Destierro,</HI> where thirty <HI>Portu∣galls</HI> are ordinarily in Garrison, under a Captain, that commands and governs all those Neighbouring Countries, without a∣ny s;et bounds to their extent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. <HI>Of the great Mouth of the great River of the</HI> Amazones.</HEAD>
<P>The great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> the relations whereof cannot equall the marvells of its magnificence, is no lesse ad∣mirable in the greatnesse of his Mouth, than in all other things, that lift it up to so much glory. He begins to open himself below the River of <HI>Genipape,</HI> and becoming al∣waies broader, he incompasseth Ilands with∣out number, infinite Nations, and Peoples that speak sundry languages; though the common language of <HI>Brasile</HI> extend it self also to all these. But the most remarkeable amongst others are the <HI>Tapuya,</HI> the <HI>Aanx∣aiase,</HI> the <HI>Mayanase,</HI> the <HI>Angaybe,</HI> and that
<PB N="87" REF="61"/>of the valiant <HI>Pacaches,</HI> which inhabite also the bankes of River of the same name, which comes from the South-side into that of the <HI>Amazones.</HI> All these Iles, are wonderfull in the festility of their Fields, in the fruitfull plenty of their Fishes; in the beauty of their bankes, which are crowned with a continuall greenesse. But the River of <HI>Pacach,</HI> considerable enough for its broadnesse, but yet of an originall or Source unknown, to us, bounds to the East the Province of <HI>Paranayba,</HI> which comes after that of <HI>Tapayse</HI> hereafter men∣tioned. The great and fair River of <HI>Paranayba</HI> gives it its name; whose Sources are farre removed towards the South, and the Nations that it waters in passing so many Fields, are not as yet well known. His Mouth is two leagues wide, and the Ha∣bitations of this Neighbourhood obey the <HI>Portugalls,</HI> who govern them. And as to the distance and measures of all those re∣markeable places, you shall finde them in the tenth Chapter of this Book; as al∣so the greatest bredth of this wondrous Mouth of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> to wit, eighty four leagues lying from the Cape of the North, to the Province of <HI>Zaparara;</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="62"/>which notwithstanding, because it is in an oblique line, is not the just measure of the true entry of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> But to get a truer knowledge of it, follow the streight line from the foresaid Cape of the North, to the Town of <HI>Para</HI> on the coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> you will yet finde it so of more than sixty leagues of breadth, not to stay on the mis-reckoning of the seven∣teenth Book of <HI>John Laet,</HI> a late <HI>flenmish</HI> Authour, who teacheth how to finde this distance, from the East point of the Mouth of this great River, to the West-side of the same; drawing yet a more oblique line, than that of the Cape of the North, to the point of the <HI>Zaparara,</HI> was. But seeing we cite here the tenth Chapter of this Book, you must not fail to put there the distance of the <HI>Genipapa</HI> from <HI>Corupa,</HI> of thirty leagues, to mend the fault of the Printers, because of the importance of all these measures.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. <HI>Of the great Prevince of</HI> Guyana.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing the Province of <HI>Guyana</HI> ends the great River of the <HI>Amazomes</HI> on his North-side; and Geographers have gained no great knowledge of it as yet; we shall speak of it in manner following. On the East it hath for its limit the great mouth of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> from the River of <HI>Genipapa</HI> to <HI>Cap-north;</HI> on the North, it is washed with the great <HI>Atlantique</HI>-Sea, for the space of three hundred Leagues, from <HI>Cap-north,</HI> to the Ile of the <HI>Trinity:</HI> and on the West, the great River of the <HI>Orenu</HI> serves for its coufines: but on the South it is kept in by a ridge of Mountains parallel to the Sea-coast, which separate it from the Provinces of <HI>Camsnare,</HI> of <HI>Apanta,</HI> and of <HI>Corepa,</HI> already mentioned. Now, these Mountains (though not yet known) are not imaginary, but reall and effective according to the naturall disposition of all these Countries, seeing the Rivers of <HI>Viapoco,</HI> of <HI>Cayene,</HI> of <HI>Maruy∣ne,</HI> of <HI>Sequebe,</HI> and other considerable ones of <HI>Guyana,</HI> which run all from the South to
<PB N="90" REF="63"/>the North, and enter into the Ocean-Sea; and those other of <HI>Genipapa,</HI> of <HI>Coropatube,</HI> of <HI>Orixamine,</HI> and of <HI>Coruris,</HI> which run all from North to South by a contrary course to the others, and enter into the great <HI>A∣mazone;</HI> have necessarily their sources in those Mountains deep and fertile Valleys. But returning to that East part of <HI>Guyana,</HI> which buts on the mouth of our famous River; we will first tell you, that it begins from that of <HI>Genipapa,</HI> considerable enough both for the greatness of his bed, and for the fine gold, that he draws along with him in his waters: whence it follows by infalli∣ble conjecture, that the mountains of his fource, and the plains of his neighbourhood, are no less rich, happy, and fertile, than in all the rest of <HI>America.</HI> Now the coast or this Province from <HI>Genipapa</HI> to the <HI>Cap-nord</HI> (which forms the great mouth of the <HI>Ama∣zon</HI>) is very uneven in its bank, and very dangerous in its navigation, because of heights and lowes, that are here sometimes found. But these difficulties are not in coming down the great River, untill after you have passed, and necessarily taken no∣tice of the place of <HI>Corupa,</HI> one of the Go∣vernments of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> on these banks,
<PB N="91" REF="63"/>about twenty eight Leagues from the place, where the great River begins to open his mouth. But because <HI>Cap-nord</HI> ends the North side of this great River, we shall tell you again, that it hath one degree and forty five minutes of North latitude, according to the tenth Chapter of this book; like∣wise that the grounds about are very low, and covered with woods; the Sea very rageing, and not very deep; the Sands moveable, and often covered with Sea∣ware, or weeds. And as to the rest of this coast, as you go from <HI>Cap-nord</HI> to <HI>Co∣rupa,</HI> see the Relations of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> reported by <HI>Johne Laet</HI> in his <HI>America,</HI> where you may finde the knowledge of it little either necessary, or delectable.</P>

<PB N="92" REF="64"/>the South side, by the Province of <HI>Marag∣non,</HI> the Northerliest of all its Countries. It took its name from a River and a Bay of the same name on the coast of the <HI>Atlanti∣que</HI>-Sea, where the Town of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> the residence of the Governour, and of justice, is in a very pleasant Ile. But that side of this Government of <HI>Maragnon</HI> is far longer on the great mouth of the great River, than on that side, that accosts the great Ocean; seeing at contains all the bank of the <HI>Ama∣zone</HI> for the space of an hundred Leagues from the River of <HI>Pacashe,</HI> to the point of <HI>Zaparara.</HI> Yet in all this length of Lands so fertile, and abundant in all things, there is but the one only Town of <HI>Para,</HI> that is considerable. From the year 1615, the <HI>Portugalls</HI> established the Colonie there, and built the fortress of it, which is a square of Mason-work on the Land-side; and of earth or turfe on the Sea-side. It is com∣manded by a Captain-major, who answers to the Governour-Generall of the Province and under this Captain-major of the Town of <HI>Para,</HI> are other three Captains of Infan∣try, dispersed in diverse places of that Countrey. It is forty Leagues from the North-Sea, and from the point of <HI>Zapara∣ra,</HI>

And as to other distan∣ces on this South side of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> you shall find them at the end of the tenth Chapter of this Book; as also those of the Ile of the <HI>Sun,</HI> which is by the waterbank of the Province of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> having more than ten Leagues in Circuit, one very safe Haven, fish abundance, Crabs without number, very good fresh or sweet waters, of <HI>lesser prey</HI> or game as much as they will, and a very pleasant air. Finally a place much more convenient than that of <HI>Para,</HI> to set up a Colonie and Forts in, whereby to command the best and safest entry of all those, which lead from the Sea into the true Channell of the great River of the <HI>Ama∣zones.</HI></P>

<P>Such as are exercised in the navigations of the great Ocean, know nothing more dangerous, nor more difficult, than the en∣tries of Ports, of Bayes, and of Rivers. But in this, as in other points, the great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> is no less admirable, than singular. For being framed as it were to receive in times coming the greatest and richest commerce of all the world, how could it hinder, that its great mouth should not be defamed by Robbers or Pirates, as well as the Gulph of <HI>Mexico?</HI> Now the same providence that hath heaped upon it more than upon all the Rivers of the earth, so many marvellous advantages and prero∣gatives; would not in this either make it less perfect; having by a certain and natu∣rall disposall and ordering of its Iles, sides, and lowes, or flats, reduced its navigation into one only Channell, and rendred the other passages as it were unprofitable; and by his impetuous currants (which carry his
<PB N="95" REF="65"/>waters thirty Leagues into the Sea) for∣bidden all strange Ships, and hostile ene∣mies to rest in these places, that they might there surprize any Navy at their going in, or coming out. But the difficulties hitherto have been great to find out the true tract, that Vessels ought to hold in going into the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> And after having consi∣dered the diverse observations reported by their Authors, <HI>Spaniards, English,</HI> and <HI>Flemish,</HI> some of them too short, and others too confused and obscure; and most or all of them, uncertain, we shall tell you in few words, that first of all, one must shun the currants in coming down, going aside of them unto two degrees of South latitude; then go up again, by the coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> at half a degree latitude of the same side of the Line, then double the point of <HI>Zaparara,</HI> and make Sail, or launch to the Southwest, after that, follow the coast of the Province of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> and pass the Channell of the Ile of the <HI>Sun</HI> at one degree and a quarter of South-latitude, and twenty six Leagnes from the full Sea: finally make Sail to the West, leave the side of <HI>Para,</HI> and keep the same latitude, to gain the bankside of <HI>Co∣rupa</HI> in the Province of <HI>Guyana:</HI> and for con∣clusion,

After that <HI>Gonsales Pizarro</HI> Gover∣nour of the Province of <HI>Kito,</HI> had first of all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (pushed on by the same ambition to find gold and silver in the vast Countries of the great <HI>Amazone</HI>) passed the high and dangerous Mountains of the <HI>Cor∣deliere,</HI> and discovered the Province of <HI>Kixo,</HI> his Lieutenant Generall <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Areillana</HI> finding himself well far engaged (and that in <HI>Challops</HI> only) on so many un∣known and great Rivers; and not knowing any sure way of going up again, and return∣ing
<PB N="97" REF="66"/>to his Generall, who with them that were with him, suffered an extream great want of Victuals; he would stay at the fa∣mous place, where the River of <HI>Napo</HI> loseth himself in that great one of the <HI>Amazones;</HI> where causing his men to build another Bark, greater, and more convenient than his others, for a long navigation, he resol∣ved by an ambitious desire to purchase glo∣ry, to commit his life and fortune to the uncertain currants and waters of that great River. This admirable voyage and singu∣lar for so many circumstances, was begun on the eighth of the Moneth of <HI>January</HI> in the year 1541, and continued with so much good luck and happiness, that this great and marvellous River was wholly navigated, and first discovered by this ventorious Knight, from whom also the River had the name of <HI>Areillane.</HI> In passing over the Provinces of the <HI>Cassique</HI> or Lord <HI>Aparia,</HI> this Prince received him very courteously, and adver∣tised him to take heed in his way of travell, of certain <HI>Amazones</HI> and warlike women, the renown of whom, though they were very far from him, yet ceased not to give him know∣ledge of them. Finally in his course he had diverse successes, sometimes good, some∣times
<PB N="98" REF="67"/>bad, according to the fear or fearless confidence of the Nations, that saw him with astonishment pass along upon the great River. And after having known not with∣out admiration, the <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> he saw in the Moneth of <HI>June, Indians</HI> in great num∣ber upon the banks thereof; and at the head of them armed women, which seemed to command and lead them to warre: where∣upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Areillana,</HI> and himself, were so perswaded of the truth of these <HI>Amazones,</HI> that they published the report of it with such confidence, that from thence the name did remain to this great and memorable River. Lastly, after sundry fortunes, and much wearinesse, on the 26. of the moneth of <HI>August</HI> of the same year 1541. he went out at the great mouth of this great River, and making sail towards the West along the coasts of <HI>Guy∣ana</HI> and <HI>Paria,</HI> Provinces of the same <HI>A∣merica,</HI> on the eleventh of the moneth of <HI>September</HI> he happily attain'd the Isle of <HI>Cu∣bagua,</HI> near to that of <HI>Marguarite,</HI> both of them inhabited by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and then rich in the fishing of Pearls.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. <HI>Of</HI> Pedro D'Orsua, <HI>and of the Tyrant</HI> Lope d'Aguirre.</HEAD>
<P>AS all the Authours, that have imploy∣ed their watchings to describe largely unto us the things of <HI>America,</HI> were neither good enough Geographers, nor good enough Geometricians, to disintangle the difficul∣ties, that grows ordinarily in such matters; so they have but too often fallen into con∣trarieties, that make their Histories confu∣sed; and into obscurities, that robs their Readers of possibilities to understand them. Such as would take advantage at depressing them, will somewhat strange at my censure of them: but I seeking nothing but truth,
<PB N="102" REF="69"/>and not after vain-glory in my works; will passe on to my subject of this famous River; the discovery whereof was no more essayed from <HI>Spain</HI> its self, after the disgraces of <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Areillana;</HI> but by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI> it was under the conduct of <HI>Pedro d'Orsua</HI> in the year 1560. by the orders of the Viceroy there, who gave him a little Army in a fleet well enough equipped. The embarkment for this expe∣dition, was on the River of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> the neerest to the Town of <HI>Lima;</HI> the chief of that Province. But a few moneths after their departure, the souldiers mutinied against their General, and put him to death; and <HI>Lope d'Aguirre,</HI> the boldest of them all, took the title of King upon him, and made himself to be obey'd of some, by threats; and of others, by promises. Fol∣lowing out the navigation of <HI>Maragnon</HI> therefore, and alwayes going down that Ri∣ver, he entred into the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> and suffering himself to be carried down by the currant of his ample channel, he stayed chiefly at the mouth of <HI>Rio-negro:</HI> where coming to consider of the greatnesse of his crime, and the danger he had to fall into the hands of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the North-sea, if
<PB N="103" REF="69"/>he went once out of the great River; he so addressed his whole Fleet in <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> as having no other designe than to rove up and down so many Rivers, and passe through so many Countreys, only to sustain his tyran∣ny. But fortune lesse blind than his pru∣dence, thrust him in his course of sailing in∣to the River of <HI>Orenoc,</HI> which coming to end in the <HI>Atlantick-sea</HI> over against the Isle of the <HI>Trinity</HI> (subject to the Crown of <HI>Castile</HI>) he was presently there made to stay, partly by his own souldiers, partly by the Catholick Kings officers, and led to the pu∣nishment, which his felony deserved; his houses also in <HI>Peru,</HI> by the same sentence were razed, and so continue and show them∣selves yet in our dayes. But a voyage so surprizing for Geographers, and so ill un∣derstood by Authors that have gone before me, because not able to take up the strange order of all these Rivers, could not be bet∣ter hitherto cleered, than by the preceding Chapters of this Book, especially the 16, and 17. And the onely difficulty which presents it self now, is onely in the <HI>leap</HI> or <HI>fall</HI> of <HI>Orenoc,</HI> discovered 1531. by <HI>Diego de Ordas;</HI> as also 1536. by <HI>Alphonse de Herrera,</HI> coming from <HI>Tinity</HI>-Isle. <HI>Her∣rera</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="70"/>made draw his Barks by Land, till he was above that leap of this River; the like possibly having been done by the Mutineers of <HI>Lope d' Aguirre</HI> the Tyrant: or that the descent of the same leap being uneasier to <HI>Challops,</HI> than to ascend it, because of the force of <HI>Apanta,</HI> (which is the name of a River as well as of a Province) it is possible also, that those of <HI>Aguirra</HI> have passed down the leap without disenbarking any; and that so much yet the more easily, if it was in the time of the inundation (which is ordinary in all those Rivers) which raiseth the boylings of their waters above the rocks of their fall.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. <HI>Of the Unfortunate Expedition of</HI> Maldo∣nado.</HEAD>
<P>MEan while the designes of this re∣nowned discovery, was no lesse vi∣gorously embraced by the ambition and co∣vetousnesse of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the Town of <HI>Cusco.</HI> The great and deep River of <HI>Amarumaya</HI> gave them the occasions of it;
<PB N="105" REF="70"/>because the Province of <HI>Moxa,</HI> of their neighbourhood, furnisheth the abundant Sources of it. And the first amongst them, that had a thought of it, (after the <HI>Inca's,</HI> that had attempted it in vain) was <HI>Gomez de Tordoya,</HI> having got the priviledge from the Count of <HI>Niebla</HI> the Viceroy of <HI>Pe∣ru.</HI> He failed not presently to make the necessary expences for it, and by consider∣able advances to order all its preparations. But his power expiring by the removall of the Count of <HI>Niebla;</HI> and his Successor (that was of the House of <HI>Castro</HI>) confer∣ring it upon <HI>Gaspar de Sotelle,</HI> confounded all things by this change. This last to au∣thorize his own credit, had associated him∣self with the <HI>Inca Topacamare,</HI> of the race of the ancient Kings, that dwelt at <HI>Bileo∣bambe.</HI> And if the too great number of Souldiers, that voluntarily offered to fol∣low them, had not cast some suspicion into the head of the Viceroy, and the spirits of the supream Counsell, who manage this conquest with an extream great jealousie; <HI>Gaspars</HI> enterprise had not been broken, and the same priviledge granted to <HI>Johne Alva∣rez</HI> of <HI>Maldonado.</HI> Who having finally <HI>An.</HI> 1566. passed the Mountains of the
<PB N="106" REF="71"/><HI>Andes,</HI> and entered into the famous Pro∣vince of <HI>Moxa,</HI> gave beginning to that un∣fortunate rather than famous expedition, in going aboard his Rafts, or Float-boates, with two hundred and fifty Souldiers well armed, and an hundred Horse in good equip∣page; to follow the tossed waves of the <HI>Amarumaya,</HI> and by suffering himself to be carried by his fierce stream, to go down in∣to the vast Fields of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> But fortune being envious at the glory that he promised himself from this famous dis∣covery, failed not presently to overturn the successe. <HI>Gomez de Tordoya</HI> (as we have said) could not suffer with patience, neither the outrage of calling him back, nor the losse of his expences: his ressent∣ment of these, followed with courage, dis∣poseth him to sedition, seeing all his com∣plaints were alwaies rejected; he therefore now carryes himself upon his own authori∣ty, to put the same enterprise in expedi∣tion, and that against the discharging of him by the Viceroy. By his own boldnesse he passeth the Mountains and the Forrests of those unknown places, and being followed by sixty <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers, he prevents his competitor by a precipitated march.
<PB N="107" REF="71"/>When he had attain'd the River of <HI>Amaru∣maya,</HI> and known that the Fleet was not yet passed, he resolved to wait on it in that place, and to fight it, as he did, soon as it arrived. The medly was sharp, and en∣dured three daies; the valour in the two parties was equall; and the number of the slain and hurt was so great in this unfortu∣nate rencountre, that the <HI>Chonques,</HI> (a Neighbouring People) casting themselves in Armes upon the rest, put all to death, with <HI>Tordoya,</HI> none escaping in this mise∣rable conflict, but the Generall <HI>Maldonado,</HI> Father <HI>Diego Martin,</HI> a <HI>Portugall;</HI> and <HI>Simon Lope,</HI> that was excellent in artillery: who, after having stayed two years amongst these <HI>Barbarians,</HI> returned by I know not what way of accommodation, to the Pro∣vince of <HI>Moxa,</HI> of the dependance of <HI>Cusco,</HI> whither they went afterwards.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. <HI>Of other Designes for the Discovery of this River.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe sad events of the Fleet of <HI>D'Orsua,</HI> and <HI>De Maldonado</HI> did no more slacken the courage, than slaked the greed of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in research of immense, or ra∣ther imaginary Treasures of the great <HI>A∣mazone.</HI> They were long enough time both in <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> quiet, and moved not for this conquest. Only in the year 1621, the King <HI>Don Philip</HI> the fourth, sent Powers to the royal Audience of <HI>Kyto,</HI> to treat of fitting conditions, for the dis∣covery of this River, with those of his Nobility, that were employed in places and charges of that Province. But by that time all these Orders (in order to Propo∣sitions, that the Serjeant Major <HI>Vincent de Villalobos,</HI> Governour of the Province of <HI>Kixo,</HI> had made for any that took that charge; and during the making whereof, for the longsomenesse of the goings, and comings of Posts, and of consultations or∣dinarily to be used in such rencontres, the
<PB N="109" REF="72"/>time of his Government coming to expire) were come to that point, that for any might take that charge, the good intentions of the Catholique King in this, were for that time made unprofitable, not only by the change of the Governour, but also by the death of his Successor <HI>Alonzo de Miranda,</HI> who car∣ried himself with the same zeal, towards the same discovery. Now the rumour of these goodly and noble Propositions of the <HI>Castilians</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> passing presently into <HI>Bra∣sile,</HI> the emulation of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> made them presently make the like about the same, in the Court of the Catholique King there, who was yet in possession of their Kingdom. So that upon the warmth and zeal that <HI>Benito Maciel</HI> Governour of the Province of <HI>Maragnon</HI> witnessed that he had for the discovery of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> by that side of its mouth that bounded his Government; the Pa∣tents were sent him 1626, in the ordinary conditions. But his generous designes were yet hindered by the Warres of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> against the <HI>Portugalls</HI> in the Pro∣vince of <HI>Pernambouk,</HI> of the same Kingdom of <HI>Brasile,</HI> and Frontier to that of <HI>Marag∣non,</HI> who feared not a little the disasters of
<PB N="110" REF="73"/>it. Mean while the orders of this conquest are redoubled by the cares of the King <HI>Don Philip.</HI> They are alwaies sent to the Go∣vernour of <HI>Maragnon;</HI> and <HI>Francis Coeille</HI> of <HI>Carvaille,</HI> who had then the Govern∣ment of it, received them 1633, and 34: who notwithstanding coming to consider, that in parting his Forces, for to send some of them, or conduct them himself, for dis∣covery of the great River of the <HI>Amazones;</HI> that the rest that stayed in the Province, would not be able to guard it against the assaults of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who from the year 1630, had taken the famous Town of <HI>Olynda,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Pernambouk,</HI> and possessed the neigbouring coasts; the expedition for the discovery was by him wisely delayed. Thus a necessity to defend themselves, hindered yet the <HI>Portugalls</HI> for this time, to aspire to the glory of an en∣terprise so much desired, and so often be∣fore checked.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII. <HI>Of the Religious of S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> Francis, <HI>that came down all the great River.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was in the beginning of the year 1635, that Captain <HI>Johne de Palacies</HI> (of whom we have spoken before) accompani∣ed with thirty <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers, and six religious of the Convent of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Francis</HI> of the Town of <HI>Kyto,</HI> descended from the Mountains of the <HI>Cordelier</HI> into the Plaines of <HI>Kixo,</HI> to settle his abode (as he did with∣out hindrance as to the <HI>Savages</HI>) at the Village of <HI>Anete</HI> upon the great River of the <HI>Amazones.</HI> In this Post (the furthest advanced of all those that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> held in the East Countries of the <HI>Andes</HI>) the valour of <HI>Johne de Palacios,</HI> and of his, seem'd no lesse admirable, than the zeal of the religious of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Francis,</HI> shew'd it self ardent for advancing the Christian Religion. Both the one and the other ex∣ercised themselves in these places, either to make the neighbouring Nations obedient to the Crown of <HI>Castille,</HI> or to gain souls to God from amongst so many Peoples, no
<PB N="112" REF="74"/>lesse fierce than Savage. But neither their perseverance in their travalls, nor their courage in their fights, nor finally their ho∣ly and zealous exhortations, could ever pre∣vail any thing, especially in the Province of the long-hair'd People, where Captain <HI>Johne de Palacios</HI> 1636, was put to death by the <HI>Barbarians.</HI> Whereby all his Souldiers were so discomforted, and the religious themselves were so far put back, that aban∣doning all of them presently their abode at <HI>Anete,</HI> they retired all to their ancient Houses; under the reserve or disposall of Father <HI>Andrew</HI> of <HI>Toledo,</HI> Father <HI>Domi∣nique de Brieve,</HI> and six Souldiers only that were resting; not to stay any longer in those unfortunate places; but to go all into a little Barke, and to expose themselves to the rapid current of the vast <HI>Amazone,</HI> and try better adventures in his waters, than on the firm Land, that butted on his banks. So destiny hath reserved the Names of those two religious to be inserted in Histories, that their marvellous hardinesse to have en∣terprised a Voyage so extraordinary for so many circumstances, might never be wiped out of memory of Ages to come. For if <HI>Amerique</HI> and <HI>Drake</HI> have been no lesse glo∣rious,

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII. <HI>Of the Departure of</HI> Pedro Texeira <HI>for this Discovery.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN end fortune being wearied, so long to crosse a design, that <HI>Spain</HI> had travelled with, with so much care; cast her favour∣able eyes on the person of <HI>Pedro Texeira</HI> Captain Major of <HI>Para</HI> in <HI>Brasile,</HI> that his courage and prudence coming to second the choice that she had made of him, and pre∣ferred him to so many Subjects of merit, he might arrive at the glory to have been the first, to make the whole great River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> feel the heavy and victorious Fleets of the Catholique King. Now the necessity of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> self-defence, who had the expence and diversion of a continuall Warre in the midst of <HI>Brasile</HI> to maintain, could not allow to this noble expedition, Forces more considerable, than those that parted from the Town of <HI>Para</HI> the twenty eight of the Moneth of <HI>October</HI> in the year 1637, under the conduct of Captain Major <HI>Pedro Texeira</HI> (of the same Nation) followed by fourty seven Barkes,
<PB N="115" REF="75"/>both great, and well armed; by seventy <HI>Portugall</HI> Souldiers, and one thousand two hundred <HI>Indians</HI> fitted to the Warre; by eight hundred Women and Vallets; and furnished with provisions meet and necessary for so long, and doubtfull an enterprise. The dexterity of the Marriners and Row∣ers, and the favourable help of the windes, broke the first difficulties, that the Fleet could have had, to gain without losse and danger the true channell of the great <HI>A∣mazone.</HI> But in departing from the coasts of the Province of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> and of the Countries that are subject to it, the <HI>Portu∣galls</HI> could no longer know neither the bank-sides, nor the right wayes and courses of the great River, because of so many crooked Armes of his, that he castes out, and thereby frames his many Islands. So that the Navigation becoming longer, by following waies uncertain, and not before known; and the troubles and toyles insepa∣rable from a Sea-Army, that must often disembark, to camp on the firm Land, be∣gan to weary the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to distaste them from further pursuing of the Voy∣age. Already many of them stole away, to regain (as well as they could) the Land
<PB N="116" REF="76"/>of their Nativity; and those that stayed peaceably behind in the Barkes, or in the Camp, ceased not to make their mindes known by their murmurings: in so far that the fear of a greater deserting of him, gi∣ving this Generall occasion of just unquiet∣nesse, he set himself to find out more sure waies to prevent this disorder, since punish∣ment and severity kept out hardly to their duty the rest of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and <HI>Vallets</HI> of his Army. He was but yet half way come in his Voyage; but feign'd that he was near enough the place, where the Fleet should arrive. And the better to perswade them to this, he ordered eight Barkes well fur∣nisht and well armed, to go before, and as it were to make the encampments for the body of the Army to follow, in places where it was to Land. But in truth, his intent was in this, only to find out and dis∣cover the best waies, that were to be held in the great River, and by these ambiguities to keep all his men in breath.</P>

<P>MEan while the Fleet goes on, her Sails being fill'd with an East-wind, al∣waies favourable, and triumphs over the rapid current of the proud <HI>Amazone.</HI> Al∣ready six Moneths were past, and six hun∣dred leagues had been measured, which they had runne; the half of the way was done, and sundry Nations had been disco∣vered. The wildest amongst them fled to the Mountains, or lesser Hills; the lesse fearfull stood unmoved upon the Bankes; the more confident came and traffiqued with the Camp: but the valientest, no more than the others, never armed themselves a∣gainst the Fleet, nor against her Avantcour∣riers or Vantguard: which already very far advanced, because of its lightnesse, was tracing and following on the channells of the great River, the waies that were streightest, and least oblique, and marked forth the addresses, or directions, on the Bankes, by Trophees set up, or by Ensignes set toge∣ther. The Vantguard was commanded by
<PB N="118" REF="77"/><HI>Bennet Rodrigue d'Olivera,</HI> a <HI>Portugall,</HI> who having been born in <HI>Brasile,</HI> and brought up as it were amidst the <HI>Americans,</HI> he dived presently into the secret of their thoughts, and by the least of their actions, he could guesse what they had in their minds: whence he was as well feared, as respected by all the <HI>Indians</HI> of these Countries: so that by his good qualities, he had also this pre∣rogative, to contribute much to the happy finishing of so noble an enterprise. So pur∣suing the Voyage with his Vantguard of eight Barkes armed, he attained with as much diligence, as good luck, the Port of <HI>Payamine</HI> in the Province of the <HI>Kixes,</HI> the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1638, while the Captain Major with all the rest of the Fleet followed the traces advices, and addresses, that <HI>Olivera</HI> left at the places, where he had rested with his Vantguard: whence the Souldiers of his Army, receiving every day comfort, they thought alway, that the morrow was to be the last of the Voyage. Thus entertain'd with this hope, they ar∣rived at the River of the <HI>long-hair'd</HI> Peo∣ple, on the Mouth of which, <HI>Pedro Tex∣cira</HI> made fourty <HI>Portugalls,</HI> and three hun∣dred <HI>Indians</HI> of his Troopes, to encamp,
<PB N="119" REF="77"/>and gave orders to <HI>Pedro d'Acosta Savela</HI> (who was appointed to the command of them) to stay in this place, and not to de∣part thence, till he heard from him; lea∣ving there moreover <HI>Pedra Bayon</HI> a Cap∣tain also of infantrie. And himself con∣tinuing his Navigation with some few per∣sons, he came likewise to the Haven of <HI>Payamine</HI> towards the end of <HI>September,</HI> having passed one thousand two hundred leagues in a continuall going up the River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> since the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI> of the year before. After that, from thence taking his way by Land, and crosse the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> he came no lesse happily, than gloriously to the Town of <HI>Kito,</HI> where he was received with such Acclamations and Triumphs, as the great∣nesse and successe of his Enterprise did deserve.</P>

But this peaceable commerce could not last long, because of the late death of Captain <HI>John de Palacies,</HI> who was defait by the <HI>Savages</HI> of this Countrey and Province. Some of the Camp desired to revenge it, and chastise their boldnesse; but others feared to get hard measure and rough handling from them. Thus the least occasion coming to sow the discord, and three <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> having been put to death by the Natives; these fierce people put themselves in arms, to defend their own lives, and their Countries. In so great a danger, the <HI>Portugalls</HI> lost not their courage; and as having been used to this long before, not to suffer such a licentiousnesse amongst the Na∣tive <HI>Indians</HI> where they were; they set themselves presently to punish them for this.
<PB N="124" REF="80"/>And after they had killed some of them, and taken alive more than seventy, they kept them as slaves, untill they all ei∣ther died, or escaped by flight. But after this the <HI>Portugalls</HI> could have no provision but by the point of their Sword, and by continuall excursions of their men, sent from their Camp; both giving and receiving also a great deal of hurt, above all in their Vessels, whereof some were saccaged, or spoil'd, and the lesse strong of them quite undone by these <HI>Barbarians.</HI> But in the snares and ambushes, as many <HI>Portugalls</HI> as were taken alive, their throats were cruel∣ly cut, which amounted to some considerable losse to them; though that of the enemies was far greater. Thus the prudence and valour of <HI>Pedro d'Acosta,</HI> the courage and fidelity of <HI>Pedro Bayon,</HI> and as well the dis∣cipline, as obedience of the Souldiers, can never receive their just enough praises, for having maintain'd their Camp thus in the Province of the long-hair'd People, for e∣leven whole Moneths, and without any o∣ther News from their own, than the return of the Fleet, upon which they went all a∣board again.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. <HI>Of the Return of the Fleet of the</HI> Portu∣galls.</HEAD>
<P>ALl things being ready, and the em∣barking at an end towards the end of <HI>February</HI> 1639, the Fleet of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> began their Return from the Haven of <HI>Na∣po</HI> on the River of the same name: and after having sailed thirty leagues on the current of this River strong and swift enough, it entered into the great River of the <HI>Ama∣zones,</HI> at the <HI>Junto</HI> of the Rivers, a much celebrated and famous place, whereat the adventurous <HI>Areillana</HI> gave the first begin∣nings to the whole discovery. In going down, the course of the great <HI>Amazone</HI> served them for Sailes, and the Marriners or Rowers lesse troubled with work rested them often, and sleeped sweetly by reason of the murmuring noise the billows made, that pusht forward their Ships. All the Peoples also and Nations upon the bankes, are pretty favourable to it: commerce of victuals and of merchandise, being opened to it on all sides. The civility of the <HI>Ho∣magues</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="81"/>appeared to it very pleasant; and the generosity of the <HI>Yorimans,</HI> seemed yet more obliging. But arriving at <HI>Rio-negro</HI> the twelfth of <HI>October</HI> 1639, the undiscreet greediness of the <HI>Portugalls</HI> stays the course and happiness of these civilities, and of their own good voyage. The <HI>Portugalls</HI> could get no riches in <HI>Brasile,</HI> but by the number of their slaves; and the Souldiers being angry for having gained nothing in all this long expedition, force the Captain-major to leave the great River of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> and to enter into that of <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> to take from them there by force of Arms their slaves, which are in great multitudes among the Nations that inhabit on that River. The Sails were already spread, and the East wind blew on their poup, and the fear of an un∣bridled licence made many fear a greater change; when Father <HI>Christopher d'Acogna</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Jesuite, pushed on by an ardent zeal to see the accomplishment of so long and hazardous an enterprize, presents himself to the Generall <HI>Pedro Texeira,</HI> and gives him a protestation written and sealed with his own hand, as on the behalf, and for the interest of the Catholick King: and ex∣horts him, to remove the Souldiers from
<PB N="127" REF="81"/>their resolution by his Authority, or to command absolutely to strike Sail, for re∣turning to the course of the great <HI>Amazone.</HI> This action so vigorously undertaken, and worthy of praise, deserved to see no worse success, than presently it did: the Sails struck, the Souldiers in silence, the Mari∣ners obedient, the Ships carried along again by the currant of the great River.</P>

<P>AFter the <HI>Portugalls</HI> of the Fleet of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> had lost the sight of the higher lands of the point of the <HI>Comana∣res</HI> on the great and famous mouth of <HI>Rio-negro,</HI> which seemed to themselves to run back from them; visited also in their pas∣sage the warlike and valiant Nation of the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> in the fashions that we have before described; and heard in these places (as before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Areillana</HI> had done) the rare and pleasant tales or fables of the <HI>Amazones</HI> (which we reserve to the Chapter following, to give you an account
<PB N="128" REF="82"/>of them) the deep <HI>Bosphore,</HI> (into which the waters of the great River, and of all the o∣thers that augment it, shut up themselves into one strait Channell of about a good quarter of a League) gives them for the second time a free and sure passage; that so following out their navigation with the like felicity, but yet receiving from the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pay∣ses</HI> the testimony of a mutuall good will, they might finally arrive at the Town of <HI>Para</HI> in <HI>Brasile,</HI> the twelfth of <HI>December</HI> 1639, as they did: but with so much glo∣ry and reputation not only to the Captain-major <HI>Pedro Texeira,</HI> but also the <HI>Portugall</HI> Officers and Souldiers of this famous expe∣dition, that their memories ingraven on tables of brass, shall no less endure in ages to come, than the great <HI>Amazone</HI> shall in <HI>America.</HI> And forasmuch as Father <HI>Chri∣stopher d'Acogna,</HI> and Father <HI>Andrew</HI> of <HI>Artieda,</HI> both <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Jesuits,</HI> were deputed by the Royall audience of <HI>Kito</HI> to assist in the name of the Catholick King, and of the Crown of <HI>Castill,</HI> to this impor∣tant discovery, and no less renowned navi∣gation; as also thereafter to go into <HI>Spain,</HI> to give an account of all to the Counsell of the <HI>Indies:</HI> these two religious Fathers

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX. <HI>Of the</HI> Amazones <HI>of</HI> America.</HEAD>
<P>THat <HI>Asia</HI> may not vaunt her self of her reports of <HI>Amazones,</HI> whether true, or fabulous, <HI>America</HI> yeelds nothing to her in this point. Let not the fields of <HI>Themis∣cyra</HI> triumph any more in the renown of her famous women; the Province of <HI>Apanta</HI> is no less famous for her heroick Dames. Nei∣ther let the River of <HI>Thermodoon</HI> be puft up any more with the glory of its conqueresses; seeing the River of <HI>Coruris</HI> is as famous for her fair she-Warriors. His famous sources are honoured with their rich habitations.
<PB N="130" REF="83"/>The Mountains of <HI>Guyana,</HI> fertile in mines of gold and silver are their confines on the North-side; and the Mount <HI>Yacamabe,</HI> proud above all the rest, is in the midst of their fair and fertile Valleys. The first no∣tice that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had of them, came to them from the generous Prince <HI>Aparia</HI> 1541, who told the first wonders of them to the adventurous <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Areillana:</HI> and the consent of all the Nations of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> in favours of this report, as true, hath from them given the name for ever to this admirable River. For all this, the guesses at this matter are not very certain; but the famous actions of the goodly Ladyes of <HI>America,</HI> during the warrs of all these conquests, do not a little confirm the appearances thereof. For these have often appeared in Arms at the head of Bat∣talioes, as is to be seen in the Histories of <HI>Acosta,</HI> and of <HI>Herrera:</HI> and in fighting with their own hands, they have sustained the assaults of the enemies, and oblieged the <HI>Indians</HI> at the same time to imitate the effects of their great courage. The valour of that noble Lass which 1536, in the Pro∣vince of <HI>Bogota,</HI> slew five <HI>Spaniards</HI> with arrows shot from her own hands, before
<PB N="131" REF="83"/>she fell dead at their feet, will for ever be renowned. And those goodly and great women, which presented themselves armed on the head of the <HI>Americans,</HI> upon the Bank of the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> near to <HI>Coru∣ris</HI> (as we have related before) gave much credit to the first opinion of these <HI>A∣mazones</HI> of the new-world. This is not yet enough for us to perswade our selves of the truth of these valiant and warlick La∣dies: the royall audience also of <HI>Kito,</HI> hath sometimes received considerable informati∣ons of it. That audience a long time ap∣plyed its cares to have sound out the know∣ledge of these <HI>Amazones;</HI> and the deposi∣tions that to them were made thereof at sundry times, agree all in this point: That in the vast fields of this <HI>America,</HI> there was one Region peopled with <HI>warrioresse women,</HI> which living and maintaining themselves without men, had no communication with them, but on some certain dayes of the year, to have by them children, or daugh∣ters like unto themselves. And in the Town of <HI>Pasto</HI> subject to the same audience, an <HI>Indian</HI> woman gave assurance, that she her self had been in their Countrey; and by her other Relations agreed with the prece∣dent
<PB N="132" REF="84"/>circumstances. But the most singular testimonies of it, that have been given to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or <HI>Portugalls,</HI> was 1639 in descending the great River, and in the great habitation of the <HI>Topinambes,</HI> and East-point of their famous Isle. This Nation as gene∣rous as valiant, was never wearied with reci∣ting the wonders of these <HI>Amazones.</HI> They spoke of their policy, and of their valour, much like what the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Latines</HI> have sung of the policy and valour of the <HI>A∣mazones</HI> of <HI>Asia.</HI> And not to stay longer on this discourse, be it true, or be it fabu∣lous, I will conclude it with this renowned name of the <HI>Comapoyares,</HI> under which the <HI>Amazones</HI> of <HI>America</HI> are every where known only.</P>

<P>BUt can one thus put an end to this work, without doing incomparable wrong to the River of the <HI>Amazones?</HI> Can one pass with silence, and without reproach
<PB N="133" REF="84"/>the rest of so many wonderfull advantages, and prerogatives; or without injustice the admirable effects, wherewith prodigall na∣ture honours and glorifies it? No certainly; and contrary to my first purpose, I consent to pass lightly over again these matters, howsoever pleasant and provoking to stay more upon them; referring to the weak curiosity of an ability limited and given to such things, the vain research of Animals, Fruits, and Plants, of this unmeasurable Countrey. In which neither doth the heat ever choak; nor the cold ever seaze it; the Air is alwayes alike, because its Winter (as in the rest of <HI>America</HI>) proceeds of no other occasion, but from inundations, which hinder the productions of the earth, or retard them for some Moneths: and not from any recesse or withdrawing of the Sun, which every day there riseth, and setteth at the same hour. What marvels should not one be perswaded of, from an heaven so benign and favourable? Let none after this won∣der, to know that the consecrated Hosties of the Father <HI>Jesuites</HI> for their Mass, are kept fresh and sound during so long a voy∣age, on the waters (which comes not so to pass elsewhere) and let none refuse any
<PB N="134" REF="85"/>longer to believe, that Flies and other such troublesome Beasts, are not met with in these places, as in others under the torride Zone, where they are so ordinary, and every where so many, that the abode in those places would be much happier, were it not for the inconveniences that these very Beasts infest them with. But what ought the land and grounds then of so noble a climate to be? Doth not this also agree to all the other prerogatives of this admirable River? And as the base and foundation of the hap∣pinesses of all these Provinces, must not this also be equally goodly and rich in all its parts? All its banks are enriched and crowned with fair trees alwayes green, and of incomparable greatness. The field and champany grounds are large, and all cove∣red with flowers diverse and variable. Eve∣ry where its Valleys are enameled with green, and alwayes moist. Its hills and mountains are all loaded with woods and forrests pleasant to behold. Plants and Simples are every where in great abun∣dance; also honey of Bees, that serves both for nourishment and for medicine: and which is yet more marvellous, a sort of oyl so excellent, that it no wayes gives place to
<PB N="135" REF="85"/>the balm, and that the most precious of the ancient world, for all sorts of hurts.</P>

<P>AS to the most ordinary aliments, that serve for nourishing innumerable Nations, and infinite peoples, that labour the unmeasurable fields of the Realm of the great <HI>Amazone;</HI> the first in order of nature are diverse and various fruits, which the happy and rich grounds of those Countries bring forth; like indeed for kind to those of all the rest of <HI>America;</HI> but more excel∣lent, ingreater plenty, and of better sub∣stance. After them, follow Fish, in so great abundance and multitude, not only in the great River, and others less, but also in an infinite of Lakes, which the ordinary de∣bordments and overflowings of their Rivers, make in the neighbouring plains; that one needs never fail to take them with their hands only; and yet more easily, when by re∣treat of the Rivers, the Lakes are dried up by
<PB N="136" REF="86"/>the heat of the Sun. In the great diversity of so many Fishes, as in the rest of the new world, the Sea-Veal, or <HI>Seal,</HI> and the Tor∣toise, are not the least considerable, whether for greatness, substance, or delicacy. And the fishing of them is wonderfull, and pro∣digious, as also the way to keep them both, long time alive. Lastly comes the hunting of Venison, as of all other lesser prey, or game, whether with Hair, or Feather, in the same abundance, and with the same ease, that in all other parts of <HI>America.</HI> But the Partridges, and the Hens of it, came from <HI>Peru,</HI> whither the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had at first car∣ried them. And for a witness infallible of all these admirable circumstances, we need but to alledge the example of the Camp of the <HI>Portugalls:</HI> which lodging every day on land, during so long a voyage, as well in go∣ing up, as coming down the great <HI>Amazon,</HI> never failed to send presently the half of their men, some of them to hunt with dogs; some of them to fish with arrows (the other half remaining to set up their hutts, and draw their trenches) whence they returned in a few hours so loaded with fish, and lesser beasts of prey of all sorts, that all the Camp had sufficient, and in abundance. But as
<PB N="137" REF="86"/>we have spoken enough of the bread, and of the meal made in those parts, of the <HI>Yo∣ka,</HI> of <HI>Mays,</HI> and of the <HI>Mandioka,</HI> as in the rest of <HI>America;</HI> we shall adde only here, that their drinks are likewise made of them, which serve them as well ordinarily, as in the common rejoycings of all those peo∣ples.</P>

<PB N="138" REF="87"/>they surprize the sight of such as consider them; Father <HI>d'Acogna</HI> having measured himself one of the greatest of them, of more than six ells in circumference. Next to them we shall mention <HI>Ebeny,</HI> and the wood of <HI>Brasile,</HI> both so precious, and so much sought after; which are so perfect there, and in so great multitude in all these fields, that they can never be spent. In the third place, we shall mention the <HI>Cocos</HI> tree, so thick along all those Banks, that the very Hutts of the Camp of the <HI>Portugalls,</HI> were made of no other than of the fair branches of these. They bear the best fruit of any in all the <HI>Indies;</HI> and with a little travail they can yeeld each of them, seven or eight crowns every year. After these comes Tobacco, which would be better, and more abundant in all those Provinces, than in all the rest of the world, if it were followed here with a happy culture. After this Canes the Sugar, whereof more excellent comes, and more abundant than elsewhere, would never fail, nor dry up, because of the inundations, which keep the fields alwayes fresh, by the number of Lakes, which are there made thereby; and whereby milles and other engines to that purpose, might
<PB N="139" REF="87"/>easily be made, by the conveniency of the woods, and of the running waters of so ma∣ny Rivers; whence it would come to pass, that the work about it would be less expen∣sive, and the revenue by it would be great∣er than ordinary. Finally comes the Cot∣ton to be spoken of, which is here every where in extreme great abundance. Then the <HI>Orock,</HI> which dyes Scarlet of a prefect good colour.

<P>A first Advertisement to Geographers, upon the Longitudes of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>FOrasmuch as the knowledge of the Lon∣gitudes of the Globe of the Earth, is as important, as necessary, in the Theory, and practice of Geography, of the Sphere, of Astronomy, of Navigation, of Astrology; it must not be thought strange, if so many excellent persons, and knowing men have ever bended themselves to establish these the most perfectly; or, to say better, the least imperfectly, that was possible to them. But as the difficulties of it have never been well overcome, at least to the Use and Ap∣plication; so I cannot now consent to the last Cart, and recentest Topography of South-<HI>America,</HI> touching this Longitude: in which Cart there is but fifty eight degrees, and twenty minutes of difference between <HI>Port Vieux</HI> (or old) and <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Au∣gustine,</HI> where South-<HI>America</HI> is broadest, and longest. For as before, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made its breadth but of fifty one degrees, and the <HI>Portugalls,</HI> of fifty five, (both the one, and the other being moved thereto by reasons of State and policy, because of the
<PB N="141" REF="88"/>debate about the <HI>Moluccoes</HI>) and after them, the moderner observers of this dif∣ference of Longitudes, extend it to fifty eight, as we have said: so this change could not have been made, but by observation of Eclipses made under divers Meridians. Whence it follows also, that this new Lon∣gitude of the West-coasts of <HI>America,</HI> is not yet exact enough, because of the diffe∣rences, that are ordinarily found in such a∣stronomicall Observations; whether through the fault and littleness of the instruments, or the negligence of the Observers, who seek the hours and minutes of them, by A∣strolabes, and not by the way of Sphericall Triangles: to say nothing of the difficulties about Parallaxes in the Eclipses of the Sun, and of the Phenombres in the Eclipse of the Moon, which hinder the taking exactly of the time of her immersion, and emersion, under and out of the shadow of the Earth.</P>
<P>But to let it be seen, that I am not the only man, that take to my self this licence, to suspect and give little trust to the exact∣ness of these Observations, so as thereby definitively to regulate Longitudes, with neglect of itinerary distances, which (being well managed) often supply in some sort
<PB N="142" REF="89"/>the others too great incertitude: I shall here set down the examples, which <HI>John Kepler;</HI> that famous Astronomer, thought good himself to set down at the end of the Cata∣logue of the Towns, of the <HI>Rodolphine</HI> Ta∣bles, that he might show the varieties of the difference of Longitudes, found out by di∣verse Observations of the same Eclipses, between the Meridians of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>No∣rimberg,</HI> as followeth. <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> makes it of thirty six minutes of an hour, or of nine degrees of the equator; and with him, many more. <HI>Stafler,</HI> and <HI>Verner</HI> of eighteen minutes of an hour, or of font de∣grees, and an half. <HI>Shoner, Mercator,</HI> and <HI>Hondius,</HI> regulate it to twelve minutes of an hour, or to three degrees. And leaving others, <HI>Kepler</HI> himself hath reduced it to four minutes of an hour, or to one degree only. So that the varieties of the difference of these two Meridians, in so little a distance, as they stand in, coming to eight whole de∣grees; with how much more reason may we doubt of the true Longitude of the West-coasts of the South and North-<HI>A∣merica?</HI> Now these diversities are no less frequent every where else, as may be veri∣fied by the difference of the Meridians of the
<PB N="143" REF="89"/>same <HI>Rome,</HI> and of <HI>Toledo</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> set down in Authors of Astronomy, and Geo∣graphy. For <HI>Kepler</HI> the last and painfullest of all, reduces it to sixteen degrees; and according to others, it amounts often to thirty. Which notwithstanding we have made an essay to remedy (as much as the matter doth permit) in our Geographicall Tables, by more exact cares and researches, than those of this curious Author <HI>Kepler</HI> himself; which being not yet Printed, yet <HI>Monsieur Morin</HI> the Kings professor of the Mathematicks, hath not thought ill to draw out of them, that which he hath set at the beginning of his Abridgement of the <HI>Rodol∣phine</HI> Tables, as preferable to any other Catalogue of Towns, that he could then meet with to serve his purpose.</P>
<P>After these Reasons brought, I would now willingly consent, that the Longitude of the West-coast of <HI>America</HI> were made shorter by ten degrees at least, that the dif∣ference of the Longitudes of the Town of <HI>Kito,</HI> and of the Point of <HI>Zaparara</HI> were made of fourty seven degrees, and so the di∣stance from the one to the other, in a straight Line, of nine hundred fourty Geometricall Leagues. And this would agree better,
<PB N="144" REF="90"/>and not be so far different from the total number of measures observed in the naviga∣tion of the great River of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> as is to be seen in the eighth Chapter of this Book; through all which (that we might change nothing, out of our own opinion) we have set down the Longitudes, according to the ordinary and recentest Carts of South-<HI>America.</HI> But surely it ought to be made broader by Geographers, that shall go over it again, to find place there for all that we faithfully relate unto them in this work, that so the great <HI>Amazone,</HI> and so many other Rivers, that run unto him, and Provinces, that are discovered upon them, may com∣modiously be lodged, and in their own na∣turall extent. In which case the East-coast of this same <HI>America</HI> to the turn of the <HI>Cape</HI> of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> should be kept in the same degrees and minutes of its longitude; and all the rest from thence towards the West, aug∣mented unto ten degrees, and compassed in the just and fitting Geometricall proporti∣ons, as well in regard to Meridians, as to the Longitudes. And the same ampliation being made over North-<HI>America,</HI> you will find his East-coast drawn back by four or five degrees, conformably to the assurances
<PB N="145" REF="90"/>that the first <HI>English</HI> gave, that sail'd to <HI>Virginia;</HI> and to the report of <HI>John Laet</HI> in his third Book of <HI>America.</HI> Whereunto I offer my self willingly to contribute my cares and studies, in favours of such, as will undertake it; making use, and serving my self, in all these Geographicall procedures, with the precepts of the true, and new do∣ctrine of the eighth Book of my <HI>Geometricall Theorems,</HI> Printed 1654, as well for the Longitudes, as itenerary distances: which I there shew, that they ought alwayes to be in great Circles, and not in parallells, redu∣ced to certain proportions. Which last is a Rule altogether contrary to the truths of Geometry, however Mathematicians, and Geographers, that preceeded the impressi∣on of that Book, have generally taught the Maxime of it, without adverting, or consi∣dering so notable an errour; <HI>That the short∣est distance from one point to another, on the Globe of the Earth, is alwayes described, or led by a great Circle,</HI> &amp;c. See the eighth Book of my foresaid Theorems.</P>

<HEAD>A second Advertisement to Geographers about the restitution of Longitudes.</HEAD>
<P>BUt to get a perfecter knowledge as well of the Longitudes, that fit <HI>America,</HI> as those that concern the East-<HI>Indies;</HI> we have resolved to set down here a method to find them easily by the motion of the Moon, upon firm land, in this manner. 1. Draw on a right horizontall Plain, that is very smooth and white, a very exact meridian Line: and with the same exactness observe the height of the Pole, by a quadrant that can mark minutes, and if possible, half mi∣nutes; as it is easie now to get such an one, by the new inventions of dividing the Alhi∣dades of it. 2. On the night of the full Moon, take the horizontall height of a fixt Star, untill the shadow of a Plummet hung, made by the Moon, shall be just upon the Meridian; but with this caution, that the height of the Star observed, be at least of thirty degrees, to avoid refractions; and that the same Stars distance from the Meri∣dian be reasonable enough for a greater ex∣actness. 3. Seek the true distance of the foresaid Star from the Meridian of your
<PB N="147" REF="91"/>Hemisphere by this Rule. As the Rect∣angle contained in the Sinuses of the com∣plement of the elevation of the Pole, and of the complement of the declination of the Star, is to the quadrat-side of the whole Sinuse; so the Rectangle contained in the Sinuses of the summe or totall, and of the difference of the half of the complement of the observed height of the Star; and of the half of the difference of the complement of the declination of the Star, and of the com∣plement of the elevation of the Pole, is un∣to the quadrat-side of the Sinuse of the half of the true distance of the Star from the Me∣ridian. But if the declination and right as∣cension of the Star, which you make use of for this astronomicall Observation, be not set down to your hand, in the same Table of its longitudes and latitudes; you shall find it by the Rules of my sixth Book of Geome∣tricall Theorems aforesaid, whither I refer you. 4. Double the foregoing half of the distance found, and substract that from the right ascension of the Star observed, if it be in the Eastern part of the heavens; but adde it to its right ascension, if the Star be in the West part of the heavens: and the summe of the addition, or the residue after
<PB N="148" REF="92"/>the substraction, will be the true right as∣cension of the Meridian of the Moon, in de∣grees, minutes, and seconds of the equator. 5. In the Ephemerids, or in the Astrono∣micall Tables, take the Node of the Moon ascendant, or descendant, in signs, degrees, minutes, and seconds of the Ecliptick ac∣cording to the hour of your observation af∣ter your best esteem: to wit, that which is nearest to that right ascension of the Moon, or of the midst of heaven, which is all one. But in the Rule of the precedent Article, if the Pole be North, the declination also of the fixed Star must be Northern; and contrarily. 6. With the same right ascen∣sion of the Moon and of the Meridian, take also in the same Tables, (or by the sixth Book of my Theorems) the midst of hea∣ven, in signs, degrees, minutes, and seconds in the Ecliptick; and the Angle of the Me∣ridian and of the Ecliptick only in degrees, minutes, and seconds; which we shall al∣wayes hereafter call <HI>the midst of heaven,</HI> to shun a longer title, or repetition. 7. Sub∣stract from the <HI>midst of heaven,</HI> the Node of the Moon; or from the Node of the Moon, the midst of heaven, that you may finde alwayes lesse residue than ninety de∣grees:
<PB N="149" REF="92"/>and this distance of the Node of the Moon from the midst of heaven, will be the base of a Sphericall Triangle-Obliquangle, whereof the lesser Angle will alwayes be of five degrees, and no minutes; and the greater Angle alwayes the Angle of the Me∣ridian, and of the Ecliptick of the foregoing Article, according to the seventh Book of my Theorems. 8. Seek the Arch of the Meridian contained between the Orbite of the Moon and the Ecliptick Circle, by this Rule. As the totall <HI>Sinuse,</HI> or <HI>Sine,</HI> is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the distance of the Node of the Moon in the midst of heaven; so is the <HI>Sine</HI> of the Angle of five degrees, to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the perpendicular. And as the totall <HI>Sine,</HI> is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the complement of the preceding distance; so is the <HI>tangent</HI> of the Angle of five degrees, to the <HI>tangent</HI> of the complement of the Angle sought for. 9. Take the difference of this Angle sought for, and of the Angle of the midst of hea∣ven, and you shall have the second Angle sought for, in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Then as the total <HI>Sine</HI> is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the complement of the second Angle required; so the <HI>tangent</HI> of the complement of the pre∣cedent perpendicular, is to the <HI>tangent</HI> of
<PB N="150" REF="93"/>the complement of the Arch of the Meridi∣an, contained between the midst of heaven, and the center of the Moon. 10. Finally, as the <HI>Sine</HI> of the Angle of five degrees, is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the precedent Arch of the Me∣ridian; so the <HI>Sine</HI> of the Angle of the midst of heaven, is to the <HI>Sine</HI> of the argument of the latitude of the Moon: which argument, you must substract or adde to the Node of the Moon, according to the disposall of the probleme, for getting in signs, degrees, mi∣nutes, and seconds, the place of the Moon in her Orbite, 11. With the precedent argument of the latitude of the Moon, take in the astronomick Tables its reduction to the Ecliptick in minutes and seconds, that you may either substract, or adde the same (according to the title of the same Tables) to the place of the Moon in her Orbite; and you shall have the true longitude, or the true place of the Moon in the Ecliptick, in signs, degrees, minutes, and seconds. As also in the same Tables, her true latitude, (if you desire it) with the same argument; seeing in all these observations, the Moon is alwayes near her copulations. 12. Com∣pare the two longitudes of the Moon, found out in this manner, on the same night, but
<PB N="151" REF="93"/>in diverse Meridians, and take the diffe∣rence of them: as also her hourly motion, at the time of both the observations, be∣cause the hours, minutes, and seconds of hours, that shall agree to the degrees, mi∣nutes and seconds of the Ecliptick of that difference, being turned into degrees and minutes of the Equator, will give the true difference of the Longitudes contained be∣tween the two Towns, where the two ob∣servations have been made.</P>
<P>Now all the secret of this easie and new method, consists in this, that the center of the body of the Moon is necessarily in the Circle of the Meridian, when she is full, or very near her opposition, the shadow of the Plummet-Line, coming just upon the true Meridian-Line of the place, where the ob∣servation is made: and in this; that nothing more being required to be added, but the plain heighth of one fixt Star, and without Parallax, the operation may be made in any Moneth of the year, without staying for a tedious restitution of Astronomy, and with∣out being put to the charges of great Instru∣ments Horizontall and Verticall, which are otherwise necessary to the practice of this Science of finding out longitudes, which
<PB N="152" REF="94"/><HI>Nonius, Horoncius, Frisius, Kepler,</HI> and <HI>Morinus</HI> the perfectlyest of them all, have painfully travelled in. But this is enough for the Geographers, and Mathematicians, that are dispersed over the world, and ought to labour in the restitution of Geography: to whom notwithstanding I could wish an ex∣acter knowledge of Astronomy, and of Trigonometry, that they might the more easily arrive at the glory of perfecting this goodly science, no less pleasant, than ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>And for conclusion, we shall in favours of an Astronomer, that will make this ob∣servation of the Moon in his own particular, that he may compare it, with that of the Rodolphine Tables; tell him, that the lon∣gitude of the Town of <HI>Rome</HI> on the globe of the earth, is fourty degrees; and that its Meridian is the same, that it hath in the Ro∣dolphine Tables, which are the best of all other astronomick ones, if you correct but the equations of the Center, and the inter∣valls of the Planets, by the fifth Book of our Geometricall Theorems. As also for the choice of the equation of the time, if you use that equation, which proceeds from the difference of the two right ascensions, to
<PB N="153" REF="94"/>wit, of the <HI>middle place,</HI> and of the <HI>true place</HI> of the Sun, in the Ecliptick; because that amongst so many divers and various e∣quations of the time, that the most excellent Authors have yet given, or established, that alone seems to me Geometricall and ex∣act; as we have said elsewhere; and that the errours of other wayes will amount sometimes to four of five degrees, in longi∣tudes upon the earth. But as the foundati∣on of that doctrine depends on the equall motion of the Sun in the Ecliptick, and not at all in the equator, the opinion that we have of it, is more from the appearances of truth, than from any design we have to contradict.</P>
