<HEAD>The Proceedings of the King of Denmark Against the English, and a Message from the English to the Governour of Elsinore.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Thursday the 9 of September, we set sail to pro∣ceed on our design for the Sound, and came to an an∣chor the 20 following, betwixt 6 and 7 at night, two leagues short of Elsinore Castle, we sent the Greyhound up before us with letters to the Governour of Elsinore, and the Admiral which rode near the Castle, that they might acquaint the King of our approach, and to what purpose: with another letter to the Merchants, and Ma∣sters of the English ships at Copenhagen, to make their address to his Majesty, for their more speedy procure∣ment of their ships, which were 22 in number, all shut up within the Booms at Coppenhagen; but the Grey∣hound was stopt a league short of the Castle, next mor∣ning
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Captain Ball went up with his boat, and delivered his letters; but while he was gone, the Dutch came and seized his man which kept his boat, and cast him over∣board, and carried her away: but the Governour of the castle made them deliver his boat again; we left no means unattempted to get those ships out; for we sent another letter to the Merchants to Petition the King, and a messen∣ger of ours likewise to him, but all proved fruitless, for he would not be seen, but sent two Lords to Elsinore, which I conceive was under a colour; so then was Capt. <HI>Adams</HI> and another twice sent, but could effect nothing, for they instead of answering our demands; demanded of us, why their Ambassadours had not audience in Eng∣land, and that they expected <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Ambassadours from us, and whether we had any letters from the State to their King, and why we so boldly came so near his Majesties hope and Castle, upon their streams, without three weeks warning, all which being impertinent to our business, we urged for a positive answer, and the 26 we received a let∣ter from the King, intimating, that he would secure them for the Merchants as carefully as he had done, and was re∣solved not to deliver them to us.</P>
<P>The Englishmen belonging to those ships, when they saw no hopes of their ships releasmēt, lett them, and came away to us; so the 27 we left the Sound, to return to give an account of our proceedings past, but by the way God was pleased to make us pertakers of a sad accident, which hapned Thursday the last of September, about 3 of the clock in the morning; the Antelope, commanded by Capt. Ball, ran ashore on the coast of Jutland, and by reason she carried the light, we followed so near the shore, that it was a wonderfull providenceany of us escaped, but bles∣sed be God, we all got off, except the said Antelope which is sunk, but all her men saved, so had that ship likewise,
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>had they steered the course that honest Captain Ball sha∣ped them: soon after we fell among the Dutch Fishers on the Dogger bank, and have taken 16 sail together, with a man of war, carrying 22 guns, with little losse.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Paris.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe 15th of this instant October thus, his Majeje∣sties answer made to the Collonels and Officers mentioned in our last, who were gone from hence as Commissioners, the substance whereof was, that his Ma∣jesty having resolved to go to one Province of his King∣dome where it was requisite; yet upon the humble ad∣dresses of his said City he had condescended to their re∣quest for returning to his good City of Paris, which he had appointed to be the munday following.</P>
<P>Madamoiselle had order to quit her lodgings in the Louvre, which were made ready for the Duke <HI>d' Anjou. Crussels</HI> Governour of the Bastile delivered up his keys and charge to an exempt de gards sent thither by the King for that end. The King of Scots hath been comple∣mented by the French Court. The Lord Digby is made Governour of the said Bastile of Paris.</P>
<P>The 19 the Parliament being sate the Duke of Orleans, acquainted the house, that he had received a letter from the Duke d' Anvilie, intimating that his Majesty did pur∣pose to be in Paris the munday following; where∣upon it was ordered, that most humble thanks should be returned to his Majesty, but withall to intreat that he would be pleased to bring with him an Amnistia in a due form, and confirmed by this Parliament. The same day in the afternoon, returned the said Collonels and other Officers from St. Germans, and with them came
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>also the Marshal de Hospital, late Governor of Paris, with Monsieur Le Fibure, late Provost of Merchants, and alto∣gether met in the evening at the Town house, where, in the full Assembly there was read the Kings Letter con∣cerning his Majesties comming to Paris, as also the dis∣missing of the Guards that were kept at the City gates; which was accordingly executed on the twentieth.</P>
<P>The 20 the several Presidents and Counsellors of the Parliament, all except eight or nine, received expresse or∣der from the King, to repair to the King at the Louvre upon the 22, where his Majesty would be in his seat of Justice. The Duke of Guise is also gone to the Court, having made a long speech to the King in protestation of his service, which hath fallen out against all expression. The 21 the Duke de Anville came from the Court, and went to the Duke of Orleans, acquinting him that it was his Majesties pleasure that he should go to Limours, and withal to sign a dissertion from the Prince of Conde, for having more to do with him or his party; which if he re∣fuse, to depart the City in 24 hours; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in default there∣of, that his Majesty would send a Regiment of the Guards to force him to obey that order: his Highness absolutely refused to sign any thing against the Prince, chusing ra∣ther to accept the second, and so departed that afternoon, and went with a great number of followers to his house at Limours: there went our with him, the D, of Beaufort, Rohan, la Rochefaveant, with many other persons of great rank, who were all commanded to depart the City.</P>
<P>The same day (21) the King came to the City about 8 of the clock in the evening, where he was received with great joy and acclamations of the people, with ringing of bells and Bonfires, as is usually accustomed. The 22 all things were made ready in the the Louvre for the sitting of the King in that Gallery called of the Pictures, the Par∣liament
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>of Paris, except some nine Members, came up one pair of stairs, and that of Pothoise another; the King sate there but little time, and spake less: onely four remark∣able things were there enacted. First, the Amnistia or Par∣don, then the excluding some Members from sitting; third∣ly, that the Princes of Conde, Conti, and ot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of their party to appear within three certain Law, or fixed days, as also to lay down Arms, and bring in his Army to his Majesty to serve according to his command, and upon de∣fault thereof, to be declared Rebel, Traytor, and criminal, <HI>la sa Majestatis,</HI> injoyning all his loving subjects to ap∣prehend him with his complices, wheresoever they find them: Lastly, a Cessation or annulling of what had been acted by the Parliament of Paris, since the King went from hence, and confirming what had been done by that of Ponthoise, and withal forbidding the Parliament for the future to meddle with any States affairs, either concern∣ing his person, counsel, or treasury, but onely to do justice to the publique, according as their place required. The Prince of Conde is now at Stenay, and the new Spanish Army at S. Quintin, the Duke of Lorrain also with his Army not far from hence, they intend to joyn in a body, and to that add the forces under the Duke of Wittem∣bergh, and the Earl of Warsowitz: altogether will make an Army of 30000 fighting men. The Regiment of Va∣lois, who was quartered at Charenton, is now gone to Li∣mours for the security of his Royal Highness. The Duke of Anville is there also, sent from the Court to perswade his said Highness to forsake the Prince and his party, the which as yet he will not do. The princes army is toward Soissen, Turene betwixt him and Paris, at Stenlis.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P> His Excellency General Blake, having sent a squadron, of ships to coast the Channel, soon received some oppo∣sition from the Hollander, (being 17 in number) who resolved to fight out their passage and freedome, rather then be taken; but after some fiery salutations, and a blou∣dy dispute, the English boarded them, seized upon the Captains, and others, and cast them over-board that were slain; and on the 22 instant brought them into Plymouth Harbour, from whence an Express came to the Councel of State, on Sabbath day last, signifying, That God was pleased to honour them with another victory, and that they had taken 17 of the Hollanders, but not without some loss. Divers of these ships were laden with Pitch, Tarr, and Masts, singular commodities for our Naval de∣sign; Yet notwithstanding all their losses, Mr, Hans is still somewhat too imperious; for on Thursday last, di∣vers of them made an attempt even up to our English shore near Yarmouth, and were so bold as to land; but the Countrey receiving the Alarm, immediately rose, and with Fowling-pieces, Clubs, long Bills, and other wea∣pons, fell upon them, forcing them to their Boats faster then they landed, killed 7, and took 5 prisoners, with the losse of one man, and another wounded.</P>
