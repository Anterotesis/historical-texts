<HEAD>To His Excellency FRANCIS LORD HOWARD, BARON of <HI>EFFINGHAM,</HI> His MAJESTIES LIEUTENANT and GOVERNOUR GENERAL OF VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hough I know it a high Presumption in me to affix so great a <HI>Name</HI> to these <HI>Papers,</HI> yet I likewise very well know how hainous and apparent a <HI>Premunire</HI> I should incurr against all <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> and in more par∣ticular manner against my <HI>bounden Duty</HI> to your Lordship, to Entitle any other to their Protection, or to set up any <HI>Foreign Power</HI> to be Supream and Paramount to that of your <HI>Excellency's</HI> over them: You my Lord be∣ing at this time seated in the great and honourable Stati∣on
<PB REF="4"/> of <HI>Governour General</HI> under his most <HI>Sacred Majesty,</HI> of that Place which the subject Matter of these <HI>Papers</HI> par∣ticularly relate to.</P>
<P>My Lord, Those many Gracious and Regal Grants and Priviledges which his most <HI>Excellent Majesty</HI> and <HI>Royal An∣cestors (of ever blessed Memory)</HI> have from time to time be∣stowed upon this his Majesties <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> since the first Settlement of the <HI>English</HI> there, have given being to these <HI>Laws</HI> for the better Government thereof; it being impossible for any number of Men to be at Peace or to flourish and prosper without good <HI>Laws,</HI> which are the firm Pillars of Government, and the strong Bonds of all Humane Society. One had as good live in a Desart amongst Savage Beasts, as among Men without <HI>Law</HI> to defend him; for <HI>Laws</HI> are the Hedges on either side the Road, which hinders from breaking into other Mens Propriety.</P>
<P><HI>Laws</HI> are every Mans Civil Armour, that Guards him from the Gripes of Rapine and all other Outragious Assaults and Insolencies, and indeed 'tis for this chiefly that <HI>Laws</HI> are of use amongst us, not only to be our Guide, but also our Shield.</P>
<P>The Great and Universal Monarch of the World, the Supream Being, at first, in the very Infancy of Time gave unto Man a Law upon <HI>Parole,</HI> inscribed in his heart, that by those inward Dictates he might be guided and bound∣ed in the whole Course and Road of his Life; but such has the Pravity of Humane Nature been, that this Divine Inscription is in a great measure defaced; so that Kings and Princes have found it of absolute necessity to give Lite∣ral and Prescripted <HI>Laws</HI> for the Government and Well-being of Mankind in their respective Places and So∣cieties.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>These Papers being a Collection of the <HI>Laws</HI> of this Place, presume not to Instruct your <HI>Excellency,</HI> who in the fair Volume of your great Mind have all the <HI>Laws</HI> of E∣quity and Justice engraven, and the vast Universal <HI>Idea</HI> of whatever can be call'd good in Mankind is there stamp'd. But my Lord, these Papers which contain <HI>Laws,</HI> and there∣fore ought to preserve others from Calumny and Censures, yet cannot themselves; humbly crave your Excellencies Patronage, which proves a Sanctuary to all Goodness, so well as your Power is a Terror to all Vice.</P>
<P>The Design of this Collection of <HI>Laws</HI> is the Good of the Inhabitants of this Place, for <HI>Laws</HI> though Enacted, stand in little stead and use till they are promulgated and made known to all persons concerned in the Obedience of them: Not my Lord that I accuse all the Inhabitants here with ig∣norance of their Duty, but, may it please your Excellency, The knowledg of all things that are good, the more diffu∣sive the better, and I hope my Lord, that my honest and good intent herein will lessen and expiate in some measure my presumption in this Dedication to your Ex∣cellency.</P>
<P>Your Illustrious Fore-fathers have been always famous for their constant and exemplary Loyalty to their <HI>Prince,</HI> and some of them have received the Signal Marks of Roy∣al Bounty. Your Excellency has eminently and deserved∣ly partaken of both, for his most Sacred Majesty (whom God grant long to Reign) seeing you treading in the same Steps of Loyalty with your Vertuous and Noble Ancestors, hath in his Princely Wisdom been pleased to entrust your Lordship with the Weighty and Honoura∣ble Employment of <HI>Lieutenant</HI> and <HI>Governour General</HI> of <HI>VIRGINIA.</HI></P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>How happy is his Majesty in so Wise and Faithful a Subject and Minister! And how happy is your Excellency in serving a King whose Wisdom cannot only discern and justly value, but whose Goodness and Power can also Re∣compence the Merits of a Subject never so great!</P>
<P>But my Lord, I dare not extend my self upon your Excellencies Panegyrick, which is an infinite Subject, and requires the Pen of the most Skilful Orator: I shall therefore content my self to admire with other Men what I cannot comprehend, lest I should offend and be injurious to your Excellency by my little and weak Expressions, which are far below my thoughts, and my thoughts far below your great and high Merits; which necessa∣rily forces all Men (whose happiness 'tis to know your Lordship) to aspire, and I more than all others, to take the liberty to write and stile my self</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My most Honoured Lord,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Excellencies most Humble most Devoted and most Obedient Servant J. P.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>A Complete Collection OF THE LAVVS OF VIRGINIA AT A Grand Assembly HELD AT JAMES CITY 23 <HI>MARCH</HI> 1662.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEREAS the late unhappy Di∣stractions caused frequent Change in the Government of this Coun∣trey, and those produced so ma∣ny Alterations in the Laws, that the people knew not well what to obey, nor the Judges what to punish: By which means Inju∣stice was hardly to be avoided, and the Just Freedom of the Peo∣ple, by the uncertainty and li∣centiousness of the Laws, hardly to be preserved. This
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> Assembly taking the same into their serious Considerati∣ons, and gravely weighing the Obligations they are to discharge to God, the King, and the Countrey, have by settling the Laws, diligently endeavoured to prevent the like Inconveniencies, by causing the whole Body of the Laws to be revived, all unnecessary Acts, and chiefly such as might keep in memory our forced deviation from His Majesties Obedience, to be repealed and expunged; and those that are in force to be brought into one Volume: And lest any prejudice might arise by the ignorance of the Times from whence those Acts were in force, they have added the Dates of every Act, to the end that Courts might rightly administer Justice and give Sen∣tence according to Law for any thing happening at any time since any Law was in force: And have also endea∣voured in all things as near as the Capacity and Con∣stitution of this Countrey would admit, to adhere to those excellent and often refined Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to which we profess and acknowledge all Reverence and Obedi∣ence. And that the Laws made by us are intended by us but as Brief Memorials of that which the Capacity of our Courts is utterly unable to collect out of its vast Volumes, though sometimes perhaps, for the difference of our and their Condition, varying in small things, but far from the presumption of contradicting any thing therein contained. And because it is impossible to honour the King as we should, unless we serve and fear God as we ought. And that they might shew their equal care, they have set down certain Rules to be observed in the Government of the Church, until God shall please to turn His Majesties Pious Thoughts towards us, and provide a better supply of Ministers among us.</P>
<P>BE it therefore Enacted by the <HI>Governour, Council,</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> of this <HI>Grand Assembly,</HI> That all the following <HI>Laws</HI> continued or made by this <HI>Assembly,</HI> shall be hereafter reputed the <HI>Laws</HI> of this <HI>Countrey,</HI> by which all <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Judicature</HI> are to proceed in giving of <HI>Sentence;</HI> and to which all persons are strictly requi∣red to yield all due obedience: And that all other <HI>Acts</HI> not in this <HI>Collection</HI> mentioned, to be to all intents and purposes utterly abrogated and repealed; unless Suit be commenced for any thing done in the time when a Law now repealed was in force: in which Case

Be it therefore Enacted, That the Assembly this present year send into <HI>England</HI> for a considerable quantity of Flax Seed to be distributed into the several Counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flax-Seed</HI> to be distribu∣ted into each County.</NOTE> and deliver it to certain persons who may sell it out to several In∣habitants, and the produce thereof be paid the Year follow∣ing with the levy, and the Country Stock by that means made good, according to the Fifth Act of Assembly 1661, to make their proportions of Flax. And whoever will Spin the Flax and Cause the Yarn to to be Weaved into Cloth of a Yard wide, shall for every Yard of Cloth so Woven of Yarn made of Flax grown in the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Allowance for every Yard of Linnen and Woollen Cloth made of the product of the Country by the publick.</NOTE> have Three Pounds of <HI>Tobacco.</HI> And for every Yard of Woollen Cloth made of Yarn here Spun in the Country, Five Pounds of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which upon produce of Certificate from some Ju∣stice of Peace in the County, that he hath seen the same in Loome, and that to his knowledg it was really made in the Country as aforesaid, shall upon producing the same to the Governour and Council, be paid so much in the publick levy in the same County where they dwell.</P>

<HEAD>CXXXI. <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> per Hogshead,</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the prudence of all Nations hath provided for the defraying the publick necessary Charges of the Countrey, rather by laying an Imposition upon the Adventurers for the Staple Commodities of the Coun∣trey, by the exportation of which the greatest advantage ac∣crues, then by taxing the persons of the Inhabitants; this present Grand Assembly endeavouring as much as in them lies, to ease the burthen of the People; and taking into Con∣sideration the great benefit that accrues to other Countreys, by the Customs arising from our Commodity <HI>Tobacco;</HI> and that <HI>Virginia,</HI> whose particular Staple it is, hath from it, nor from the Adventurers hither, no publick advantage; We have thought it necessary and convenient, and accordingly have Enacted and Confirmed, That all Merchants, Ma∣sters of Ships and Mariners, trading to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and not bound by Charter-party to return and discharge in any of the <HI>English</HI> Dominions in <HI>Europe,</HI> shall pay for every Hogs∣head

<P>WHereas the mutual Discontents, Complaints, Jea∣lousies and Fears, of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> pro∣ceed chiefly from the violent Intrusions of divers <HI>English</HI> made into their Lands, forcing the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> by way of Revenge, to kill the Cattle and Hogs of the <HI>English;</HI> and by that means Injuries being done on both sides, Reports and Rumours are spread of the hostile Inventions of each to others, tending infinitely to the di∣sturbance of the Peace of his Majesties Countrey; and where∣as the Laws prohibiting the purchase of any <HI>Indians</HI> Lands, (unless acknowledged at <HI>General Courts</HI> or Assemblies, by reason it is as easie to fright them to a publick as well as a private acknowledgment) are made fruitless and ineffe∣ctual,
<PB N="97" REF="57"/> corrupt Interpreters often adding to this Mischief, by rendring them willing to surrender, when indeed they intended to have received a confirmation of their own Rights, and a redress of their Wrongs; which Mischiefs had they continued, must needs have involved the Countrey into an inevitable and destructive War: For Remedy of which Inconveniences, and that for the future a sure equita∣ble Peace may be established, the Governour, Council, and Burgesses, out of their tender care of Justice, and the Peace of this his Majesties Countrey; have Enacted, Ordained and Confirmed, and do by these presents Enact, Ordain, and Confirm, That for the future, No <HI>Indian</HI> King or other, shall upon any pretence alien or sell, nor no <HI>English</HI> for any Cause or Consideration whatsoever, purchase or buy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No <HI>Pur∣chase</HI> shall be made by the <HI>English,</HI> of a∣ny Lands now justly claimed or actually pos∣sessed by the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> any Tract or parcel of Land now justly claimed, or actually possessed by any <HI>Indian</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> whatsoever; all such Bargains and Sales hereafter made or pretended to be made, being hereby declared to be invalid, void, and null, any Acknowledgment, Surrender Law, or Custom, formerly used to the contrary notwithstanding: And further, That the <HI>Indians</HI> properties in their goods, be hereby assured and confirmed to them, and their persons so secured, that who∣ever shall defraud or take from them their Goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Inju∣ries shall be done to the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> or do hurt or injury to their persons, shall make such Satis∣faction, and suffer such Punishments as the Laws of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or this Countrey do inflict, if the same had been done to an <HI>English-man.</HI></P>

<P>And be it further Enacted, That for the better relief of the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> whom the seating of the <HI>English</HI> hath forced from their wonted conveniences of Oystering, Fishing, and Gathering Tuchahoe Cortenions, and other wild Fruits, by which they were wonted for a great part of the year to sub∣sist: Be it therefore Enacted, Granted, and Confirmed, That the said <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Poor <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> may be li∣cenced to Fish for <HI>Oysters,</HI> and gather <HI>Wild Fruits.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No person whatever shall buy or receive any <HI>Commo∣dity</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> without li∣cence.</NOTE>And because many under-hand and unlicensed Traders do truck and trade with the Indians (contrary to the Act of As∣sembly, and to the great prejudice of all such as legally pro∣cure Commissions from the Governour) under pretence that the things truck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for be given them by the Indians: Be it therefore Enacted That what persons soever, shall upon a∣ny pretence whatsoever, buy, take, or receive, any thing or commodity, from an Indian, shall upon proof thereof at any Court, be ordered to pay treble the value of the thing received, to the person injured thereby.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences arising in Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> shall be refer∣red to the Go∣vernour.</NOTE>And because sometimes differences may arise between the Indians and those they trade with, which if we should pro∣ceed by way of Arrest, might tend much to the disturbance of the peace of the Countrey: Be it therefore Enacted, That any Commissionated Trader having a Difference with any In∣dian King or other, shall repair to the Governour for him or
<PB N="99" REF="58"/> such other as he shall appoint, to determine the matter in controversie between them.</P>
<P>And because the imprisonment of an Indian may bring a War upon the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No person shall Imprison any <HI>Indian</HI> King with∣out Warrant from the Go∣vernour and two of the Council.</NOTE> and consequently the making of Peace and War being wrested out of those hands it is by his Majesties Commission intrusted, into the power of every In∣dividual in the Countrey: Be it therefore Enacted, That no person of what quality soever, presume to imprison any Indi∣an King, without a special Warrant from the Governour and two of the Council, as they will answer the contrary at their uttermost peril.</P>
<P>And because this Act cannot be put in Execution with∣out Commissioners to view the present Bounds of the En∣glish and Indians: Be it therefore Enacted, That the Ho∣nourable Governour be desired and authorized to appoint uninteressed persons Commissioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Bounds be∣twixt the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> shall be fixe.</P>
<P>And Com∣missioners thereto ap∣pointed, shall view the same annually.</P></NOTE> to go with parties of Horse to the several Indian Towns, and there to proclaim these and the following Articles of Peace between us and the Indians, to settle the Bounds between us, and to ap∣point others of the most integrity, to fix the time and assess the Work, to help the Indians fence, and all other things by this Act enjoyned. And for prevention of future In∣trenchments beyond the Bounds once fixed, Be it further Enacted, That the Governour be desired and authorized to commissionate certain Persons annually to visit the same, and to take care that no intrenchment be henceforth made upon the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

<P>And it is further Enacted, That if any <HI>Indian,</HI> by the in∣veigling of any <HI>English,</HI> or of his own will, shall without leave of the King or great Man of the Place, come within the bounds limitted them, and there procure harbour or en∣tertainment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penalty of harbouring Run-away <HI>In∣dians.</HI></NOTE> it shall be lawful for any <HI>English Man</HI> to take the said <HI>Indian</HI> and to convey him to his Town to be punished, and to recover of the <HI>English Man</HI> that harboured

<P>And be it further Enacted, That what <HI>English Man,</HI> Trader, or other, shall bring in any <HI>Indians</HI> as Servants, and shall assign them over to any other, shall not sell them for Slaves, nor for any other time than <HI>English</HI> of the like ages should serve by Act of Assembly.</P>
