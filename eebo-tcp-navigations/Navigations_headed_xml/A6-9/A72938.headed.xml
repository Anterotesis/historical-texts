<P>We haue aduice that his Emperiall Ma∣iestie did stay in <HI>Odenburgh,</HI> and the 26. of Maie he caused the States there present to meete, making his proposition in the La∣tine tongue vnto them, and caused them greatly to reioyce, and deliuered the same afterwards in writing vnto them: the Bi∣shop of <HI>Gran</HI> promised in the name of the States, that they would consult vpon the same. And is concluded already, halfe <HI>Germany</HI> and halfe <HI>Hungarian</HI> garrisons to lay in the fortes and strong holdes; The diet prospers so well, that wee hope his Maiesty will be here ere long.</P>
<P><HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> is not at <HI>Odenburgh,</HI> ha∣uing bene called backe from his iourney, his Lady being deceassed: But the Lord <HI>Budeani</HI> was to meete there.

<P>This day is arriued heere an Ambassa∣dour from the King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> but his Maiesty being departed, went from <HI>Oden∣burgh,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>where he had audience by his Ma∣iestie; and being come backe, related that his Imperial Maiesty would deuise means to bring the Empire to peace, because that those that were quiet might not be distur∣bed. The successe Time will reueale.</P>

<P>They haue written yesterday from the city of <HI>Zitta,</HI> that it had rained there brim∣stone, which did giue, not onely an euill smell, but it kindled and burned likewise as other brimstone.

<HEAD>From Frankfort the twlfth day.</HEAD>
<P>The army of <HI>Mansfelt</HI> is Thurseday last departed from great <HI>Geraw,</HI> and marched towards <HI>Manheim,</HI> to what intent is not knowne. The <HI>Landgraue</HI> is still in the ar∣mie. <HI>Tilley</HI> in the meane time makes him∣selfe very strong, a great number of his forces being arriued about <HI>Darmstat,</HI> haue had many skirmishes with <HI>Mansfelts</HI> for∣ces. The Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> did arriue last night at <HI>Nidda,</HI> belonging vnto the <HI>Landgraue</HI> of <HI>Hessen,</HI> and is but foure Dutch miles from hence, and came this night neere this cittie, being seene already diuers of his forces; and it is likely some
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>stratagems will be set on foote ere long, but in the meane time the countries here∣about are indifferently mightily spoyled and ruinated. We haue likewise now cer∣taine newes, that the Baron of <HI>Anbolt</HI> is ioyned with Monsieur <HI>Tilley,</HI> and is about <HI>Zumgenbergh.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Collen the <HI>14.</HI> day.</HEAD>
<P>Yesterday was reported here, that in the dominion of the <HI>Landgraue</HI> of <HI>Darmstat;</HI> had beene diuers and great skirmishes be∣twixt <HI>Mansfelts</HI> and the Spanish forces, and that <HI>Mansfelt</HI> had gotten a great ouer∣throw. But this day wee are aduertised from <HI>Ments</HI> and thereabouts, that there haue beene great knockes giuen, but that <HI>Mansfelt</HI> had obtained the victorie; and after the lame transported his forces ouer the <HI>Rheine,</HI> which caused no small feare to those of <HI>Ments.</HI> Wee doe vnderstand likewise, that the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Bruns∣wicke</HI> is to ioyne with <HI>Mansfelt.</HI> The of∣fects will be knowne heereafter.</P>
<P>From <HI>Mastright</HI> wee vnderstand, that
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>the Spanish forces haue their rendevous there and at <HI>Diest,</HI> and wee appoynted there likewise the forces in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as a∣mongst them those that lay before <HI>Sluice,</HI> beeing the Forts and Skonces beset with Countrey people, and should daily more be leuyed of them for the defence of the countrey. But whither the Spanish for∣ces are to march, is not yet knowne. They would faine haue put in <HI>Sherwghenbosch</HI> an hundred men more, but that the Citizens would not receiue them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Wesel the <HI>15.</HI> day.</HEAD>
<P>Count <HI>Henrie</HI> of the <HI>Bergh,</HI> is with his forces yet here about, and looks for more ayde.

<P>In <HI>Zealand</HI> are certaine shippes landed, comming from <HI>England</HI> with souldiers to bee dispersed amongest the English Regi∣ments in those Prouinces.</P>
<P>There is brought in a good prize heere, and other also at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Duchuysen,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>and wee are likely to haue daily more and more, in regard of the ships abroad.</P>
<P>The two Pyrats of <HI>Dunkerk</HI> haue saued themselues in a Port of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but our men of warre lay in wait for them.</P>

<HEAD>From Venice the third of Iune <HI>1622.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Is written from <HI>Naples,</HI> that those that haue caused lately the Commotion, are dayly clapt vp, and that the Marquesse <HI>de Terrico</HI> did leuy a Regiment for <HI>Milaine.</HI></P>
<P>Letters the 16. of Maie from <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI> do declare, that the great Turke, vn∣der colour to visit the sepulchre or tombe of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> intendeth to make a notable attempt against the Christians, being his nauy foure score saile strong, bound vnto <HI>Archipelago,</HI> to ioyne with the Gallies of <HI>Rhodes;</HI> likewise were diuers other Gal∣lies sent towards the Blacke Sea, against the Gosacks, seeing that notwithstanding the peace concluded with <HI>Polonia,</HI> they did robbe in the aforesaid Sea, which likely wil cause the warre to be renewed against the said Kingdome.</P>
<P>From <HI>Milaine</HI> wee understand, that the
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>gouernor hath published a proclamation whereby all those that haue borne any office since the yere 1592. are commāded (vpon life) to giue notice of their goods, and rents, &amp; to shew how they haue got∣ten the same.</P>
<P>Wee are aduised from <HI>Bundten,</HI> that the confederated haue recouerd <HI>Mayeuelt,</HI> and besieged <HI>Chur,</HI> and that there is made pre∣paration to rescue the same; at the other side, those of <HI>Zurich, Basil</HI> &amp; <HI>Barne</HI> haue sent ayde vnto the confederated aforesayd.</P>
<P>The 13. Cantons of Swisserland haue al∣so sent an Ambassador to the Arch-duke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> to know his resolution, whether hee will surrender the <HI>Veltolines</HI> and other places taken; and in case of denyall they will assist them.</P>

<HEAD>From Breslaw in Silecia the second day.</HEAD>
<P>The country of <HI>Oppelen</HI> a general assem∣bly there being made to inuest the bro∣ther of <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> was inuaded by fiue thousand <HI>Cosacks,</HI> which haue done great hurt by pillaging, robbing &amp; burning, &amp; 5000 more are coming, resolued to trauel to <HI>Glats</HI> through <HI>Silecia.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<P>Two dayes agoe are sent from hence to∣wards <HI>Glats</HI> certaine Waggons with mu∣nition, and two peices of Ordinance, every one of them drawne by an 100. Horse, which being not strong enough, they were enforced to send for more. The Bishop of <HI>Ments</HI> will be at the siege himselfe, and will be inquartered with his Forces at <HI>Francken∣steyn.</HI> Here is Newes likewise, that the old Count of <HI>Thurn</HI> is marching with 6000.

<P>From <HI>Vienna</HI> the 8. of Iune. His Imperiall Maiestie is yet at <HI>Odenburgh,</HI> and the States of <HI>Hioigary</HI> consult daily about his Proposi∣tions. The Lord <HI>Stensell Thurso</HI> is elected and sworne <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Hungaria.</HI></P>
<P>The States of <HI>Hungaria</HI> will not suffer by any meanes that the Iesuits shall possesse any goods in the Kingdome.</P>
<P><HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> hath sent his Ambassadour to the <HI>Dyete,</HI> but consults not with the States, and hath sent a faire Turkie Horse, with rich furniture vnto the Emperour for a present.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
<P>The Lord <HI>Budiani</HI> hath likewise sent his Ambassadour, but he stands very firme to his Propositions. But neverthelesse they hope, that the <HI>Dyete</HI> will soone come to take a happy end.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour of <HI>Denmarke</HI> it seemes hath no other charge but to exhort the Emperour, that he will be pleased to ap∣pease the Empire; it is thought that he shall be soone disparcht.</P>
<P>From <HI>Prague</HI> the 9. of Iune. From <HI>Glats</HI> we heare, that their Garrison hath slaine divers Companies of horse of the Count of <HI>Ligh∣tenstein</HI> in a Sallie, whereupon are sent from hence certaine Waggons with Munition, and 6. Pieces of Ordinance, to take effectu∣ally the siege in hand.</P>
<P>In the meane time, haue those of <HI>Glats</HI> ioyned with their Forces the 6000. revol∣ted Moores, and having armed the same, haue taken lately a Towne, called <HI>Winschel∣lurgh,</HI> beset with fiue Companies, which were almost all slaine or taken. And the old Count of <HI>Thurn</HI> is marching with great Forces to rescue <HI>Glats</HI> aforesaid.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P>Those of <HI>Klingenbergh</HI> stand yet brauely out, and lately assaulting their enemies, haue killed many in their Sconses, and pul∣led them downe, returning with one of their Colours.</P>
<P>Sunday last is here Proclaimed and pub∣lished, that all the debters of those that haue left the Country, as of the executed and arrested persons, shall make knowne vpon great penaltie vnto the Commissio∣ners, thereunto appointed, what they owe them, and pay afterwards at a certaine time the same.</P>
<P>This next Sunday are the Catholiques to take the Church of the Sussits in the lit∣tle Towne for their owne vse.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leipsich</HI> the 12. of Iune. The Duke of <HI>Saxon</HI> Elector is as yet at <HI>Langensaltz.</HI> The Generall <HI>Wolfe</HI> of <HI>Mansfelt,</HI> marches vp to morrow with the red and yellow regi∣ment, and 500. horse, towards <HI>Duringen;</HI> whereupon the Country people shall re∣turne home againe.</P>
<P>From <HI>Franckford</HI> the 16. of Iune. In the last Skirmish betwixt the Spanish forces, and
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>them of <HI>Mansfelt,</HI> are on both sides slaine a∣bout 1000. men. The Counts horses being not seconded in time by his foote, did re∣treat without disorder. On the Spanish side, besides the Baron of <HI>Bussy,</HI> are divers great officers killed. But they haue taken prisoner the yong Palsgraue of <HI>Birkenvelt</HI> with certaine officers.</P>
<P>Hereupon are the Spanish marched on with resolution, to lay a bridge over the <HI>Mayne,</HI> betwixt <HI>Hannaw</HI> and <HI>Steinheim,</HI> to cut off the passage of the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> but vnderstanding how strong he was, and not farre from thence, haue taken vp their bridge, being almost halfe finished, and in∣quarterd themselues about <HI>Eberstadt,</HI> and there about in the dominions of the <HI>Landt∣graue</HI> of <HI>Darmstadt.</HI></P>
<P>This last night about ten a Clocke are some of the Forces of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> arrived at <HI>Henst</HI> (belonging vnto the Bishop of <HI>Ments</HI>) being conducted by <HI>Kniphowsen,</HI> discharging presently their Ordinance against it; they lye yet there: and neere the Towne is seene a great fire, to what purpose we
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>know not yet. Many of his Commaun∣ders are in this Cittie, being all the Inns most taken vp, we are likewise to heare shortly of some notable attempt.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cullen,</HI> the 18. of Iune, wee haue but little or no newes to write at this pre∣sent, the newes of <HI>Ments,</HI> is not so good as wee did write at first, beeing a great number of eminent Officers sent thither and buried.</P>
<P>From <HI>Westphalia,</HI> we heare that the Spa∣nish forces, were marched towards <HI>Laps∣stadt,</HI> and demaunded great summes of money of the Towne besides 7. men. Other say that they haue besieged <HI>Raven∣spurgh,</HI> the certaintie you shall haue by the next.</P>

<PB N="18" REF="11"/>to surrender the Towne, there were sent great forces to take it, which the besieged espying, and that there was no succour at hand, they haue abando∣ned the Towne and Castle, flying all that could ouer the River of <HI>Maine:</HI> where∣upon the forces of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> taking it, slue all the Souldiers they could meete withall.
