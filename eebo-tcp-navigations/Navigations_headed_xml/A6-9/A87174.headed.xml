<HEAD>For the Faire and ho∣noured hands of M<SUP>is</SUP> <HI>R. G.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou may well expect that I should appeare in guilty colours, and even blush my self into blood at the thought of my temerity; You may justly condemne my presumption, and reproach my confi∣dence, that durst attempt to dedicate these recreations to your reading, or think, that Inke and Paper could be a Present that might deserve your acceptance: No, Madam, though it were possible they could be writ with a quill pluck't from the wing of an Angel, yet could they not de∣serve so great a blessing. What then can I hope for, who make my Addresses so poor∣ly? Who is there that will not judge me to be so great an offendor, as to have soared above the reach of your pardon, and that you ought to invent new punishments, if
<PB REF="3"/>you would have any that might ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch my crimes. But when I consider that variety of Ornaments wherewith Nature hath so plentifully enrich't you, that had she made another like you, she had utterly undone the whole race of perfection, &amp; no woman would hereafter have had the pri∣viledge to becall'd handsome; when I con∣sider in the shallownesse of my fancy all that is excellent in you, I cannot but think that Charity hath a great share in your soule, and that you can pardon a person, whose ambition in sending these un∣refined papers to kisse your faire hands, was not at all to disturbe you in your higher and better imployments, but only that in such small things I might explain the greatnesse of my Devotion. I confesse that the largenesse of gifts are generally powerful in the minds of the Receivers, &amp; can either create merits where there are none, or set a luster upon those that are but small: but I know, you have a soul of ano∣ther composition, and can value the gift by the person, and not the person by the
<PB REF="3"/>gift: and truely 'tis that which renders you most like your selfe, and makes you approach neerest to Divinity; For, hea∣ven receives a Prayer, or a grain of Incense, (if free from impurity and hypocrisie) with a greater relish and re∣spect, then if they had sacrificed whole <HI>Hecatombs,</HI> or emptied <HI>Arabia</HI> of its Perfumes. I begin therefore to think it a crime of no small extent, to mistrust your favour, being I offer this with the same zeal and reverence, in which a Lover courts his Flame, or a Pilgrim his God. 'Tis true, Madam, when I cast't my eyes upon you, and survey'd the height of your merit, and then turn'd them upon my selfe, and beheld the meannesse of my owne, the greatnesse of the disproportion made my duty struggle with my respects, and I doubted, whether I might write or no: But all oppositions were vain, and quickly vanish'd; for, were my Teeth a row of Thornes, yet my Tongue would through, when it is to make its addresses to such an Angell as your
<PB REF="4"/>selfe, whose every look utters Captivity, and can turn Saints to Idolaters.</P>
<P>When I first took notice of this <HI>Pa∣negyrick,</HI> as it appeared in the <HI>French</HI> its naturall Language, and finding the Matter well and orderly disposed, the Sense perswasive and eloquent, the words high and significant, I judg'd it worthy to be translated for my selfe; but, when I considered the strangenesse of the subject, that it was a <HI>Woman;</HI> and the dignity of the person, that it was a <HI>Queen,</HI> that had deserved all these Encomiums, I then began to think, (pardon the expression) that it was wor∣thy to be translated for you: For, Lady, do but strip the great <HI>Christina,</HI> of her Majesty and manly Vertues, and I'le then say, I do but present you with those graces, which you represent, and, like a true Glasse, only shew you what you are.</P>
<P>But, Madam, in the reading of these my Endeavours, if you finde any thing to be well done, I must pay my thanks to you; for, 'tis from your fair eyes that I
<PB REF="4"/>fetch'd my directions and influence. But, if any thing look with an unpleasant aspect, my unskilfulnesse in the language, and the fewnesse of my years, being yet arrived but at the age of twenty, may make up, if not a just reason, yet (at least) a prevailing excuse.</P>
<P>It is not my ambition, nor was it ever my desire, to appear in Print, I alwaies judged my selfe then most secure, when most private; nor had I now exposed my thoughts to the publick view, had not the importunity of some friends, and a desire to serve you, and your fair sex, (like two perswading Oratours) so wrought upon my resolutions, that they could no longer deny to pay obedience to such powerfull reasons. Some persons there are, who strive to eclipse the glories of Women, and draw a cloud over that flowing lustre, that alwaies attends their graces; but I have here discovered to the world and them, in the happy exam∣ple of this great <HI>Queen,</HI> that Women, as well as Men, have Soules; that may not
<PB REF="5"/>only be capable of great matters, but can also enjoy all those ornaments, which may make up a just accomplishment, and render persons both happy and admir'd.</P>
<P>I will not say, that this Translation is exact, nor dare I say, 'tis acceptable; but, as to that part which belongs to my endeavours, I freely confesse, it is not worth your perusall: Yet, <HI>Fair,</HI> do you but throw your eyes upon it, and it presently becomes pretious, and may be fit for the Cabinets of Princes. So the daring <HI>Prometheus,</HI> wrought a Picture out of clay, deform'd and cold in the touch; but it was the fire which he stole from heaven, that added life and motion to that imperfect <HI>Embryo.</HI></P>
<P>But, Madam, being 'tis to you that I write, it might well be expected, that I should not so much strive, how to tran∣slate a Panegyrick, as how to compose one: For, the world might count me an Infidell, one void of the light of Reason and Nature, if, having so fair an op∣portunity as this, presented to my accep∣tance,
<PB REF="5"/>I should not glance upon the en∣dowments of your person; Nay, I should think it a piece of justice, if heaven, be∣cause I would not praise you when I might, should strike me dumb, and not let me praise you when I would.</P>
<P>But, Madam, your commendations are so copious a subject, that every thought of them, puts my fancy in a Labyrinth, where the greatest of inventions may for ever wander, and yet never finde a thread to procure their liberties. The choice of Wits might here strike saile, and confesse, that silence is their best Orator; and that a look from your face, can more explain your graces in one minute, then their tongues in a whole age. And there∣fore I shall only say, that heaven hath dealt with you, as the Geographers with the World, which though a vast Body in it selfe, they have contracted into the narrow compasse of a Globe. So, all those graces that are scattered about the world, are united in your face; and while I contemplate you, I behold them all.
<PB REF="6"/>Some Women, like the <HI>Panther,</HI> have fair and well-proportioned bodies, but are fain to obscure their faces in their silken clouds, fearing to betray the mise∣rable ruines, either of time or diseases: Some are like <HI>Ermines,</HI> beautifull in nothing but their skins, and some are like rough Diamonds, whose out-sides carry no enticeing charmes, but look within, and you'l finde soules full of brightnesse and action. But in you, Madam, as so many Lines running to one Center, these severall graces meet, and frame up an exact Harmony. You shine above others, as a Planet above a private Star: And if there be any yet, who dare over-va∣lue the excellency of a Lady, and call her a Star, I'le say, you are a Constella∣tion: for 'tis but justice, that I should rank you with your deserts; and, as nature, so description, might make you exceed.</P>
<P>Perhaps, <HI>Fair,</HI> you may say, that I flatter. But, Oh! don't brand my in∣nocence with so great a sin. I confesse, had I said this to another, I should have
<PB REF="6"/>been my owne Judge, and condemned my selfe, as a person guilty of that crime: Had I told another, that her eyes carried fire enough, to tempt the gods to invent new disguises, and visit the earth again. That Lillies and Roses enjoyed no Whites and Reds, till her Cheeks taught them their complexions, I should have thought, I lyed; but when I speak the same things to you, that which before was false, is converted into truth, and that which was a sin before, is now become piety. And therefore don't think, that I write this out custom, but devotion; not as though I use to speak so, but because you use to be so.</P>
<P>But, Madam, I shall no longer sus∣pend your judgment, or spin out time and my thoughts in a discourse, where my respects may prove as tedious, as your graces are alluring; I fear, lest while I strive to entertain the more pleasing sub∣ject, I keep you from the more pleasing matter; for, me-thinks I see your incli∣nation more towards the Author, with a desire to hear him breathe, where you will
<PB REF="7"/>finde wit and invention run like para∣lells, exact and equall. As for the Lan∣guage, so much as refers to the transla∣tion, I resigne it to the justnesse of your censure. My thoughts are yet but Me∣teors, and maintain only a flattering and borrowed light; it rests only in the power of your creating smiles, to make them seem reall Stars, and become six'd. In which blessing, though I claime nothing, yet I scarce doubt an interest. For it were a crime to think, that a Body, soft and melting, like yours, can be inhabited by a soul of a more stubborn constitution.</P>
<P>If, <HI>Fair,</HI> you will now vouchsafe to pardon all those defects, which you finde, either in my Pen or my Person; either in what I write, or what I am, your good∣nesse will multiply my debts, and add new chains to those fetters, wherein you have so bound me, that sooner can heaven want power to punish offenders, or your fair face to procure adorers, then I have a Being, and not be,</P>

<HEAD>A PANEGYRICK To the most Renowned and Serene Princesse <HI>CHRISTINA,</HI> By the Grace of God, Queene of Swedland, Gothes, and Vandals.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen I consider this glo∣rious Assembly, com∣posed of so many ho∣nest men; when I be∣hold the happy presence of such great worthies, illustrious by so many considerations; and lastly when I cast my eyes upon this fair and noble Princesse, known
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>to be the most warlike and the most generous in the world, who hath fixed her standards, wheresoever she directed her desires; I cannot but conceive, by a faire feeling of vanity, a good presage of that which I have purposed to speak: for such a value and so great a Generosity, which in you meete, so happily uni∣ted, cannot but inspire me with re∣sentments, as truly noble as sub∣lime.</P>
<P>But when I advance my ambiti∣ous eyes, and travelling above this middle Region of the Aire, I lift them up to the firmament, there to contemplate the Sunne; I would say, when I raise them up to your Sacred Majesty, that divine starre, which there, by its reflection, shoots forth beames so magnificently, and with so great a spendor; I almost wonder in this dazling, that my repentance don't arrest my designe,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>and that my temerity by being for∣ced into silence finds not out a pu∣nishment for its boldnesse. Be not astonished, my Lords, at my sur∣prize, though I seeme ballanced be∣tweene what I ought to say, and what I ought to doe; and though you see my cheekes usurped by a rednesse, which the acknowledge∣ment of my own disability to enter∣taine this Assembly, hath invited thither. There is nothing so naturall to men, as to disrelish their fortunes, though it bee in the meanest con∣cernments; nor are they lesse prone to nourish a facility to all those things which flatter them; and yet they doe not know the dissicul∣ty then, when the greatnesse of the subject doth oblige them to humble their vanities. You see an example in my person: and I ought not to hide from you any of that pompous and divine matter, wherein I had
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>figured to my selfe this adorable Princesse, the object of our admira∣tion, and the subject of our dis∣course, though I confesse I cannot represent her, but in an imperfect Idëa: and therefore it is that at this time considering the Carriere which I have purposed to accomplish, and viewing it in all its apprehensions, I acknowledge the weakenesse of my reason, that cannot dive into the difficult and counterfeit illusions of my senses, which, alwaies like to themselves, and alwaies deceivers, have, under vaine apprehensions, shaddowed forth to me their de∣lightfull Fables. And truly! consi∣der with me that which I can tell you, of a person who hath no quali∣ty but what is divine, and who au∣thoriseth the disproportion that she meets with among the vanities of Greece, the pride of Rome, and the transcending truths which wee
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>see with our eyes; all that the one and the other, ingenuous to de∣ceive, would make us beleeve to be more admir'd and greater in their Heroïna's, who have drained the most delicate Rhetorick, to furnish their Nurslings: 'tis we onely that can make Adorers and Mutes of their Panegyrists and Oratours, to whom the respect to so happy a Majesty, and their inability to ut∣ter, what could neither be conceiv'd nor exprest, would equally com∣mand a silence. In respect of this Lady, the purple of Tyre and Sidon have but a languishing splendor; and the flowers, the fairest and best cultivated, which art (to say truth) did ever produce, have but an earthy smell and feeble charms, since they cannot, unlesse by shamefull Negations, say any thing of this mi∣racle of Nature. And this talkative, I might say, this proud Eloquence,
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>which hath formerly gloried to have beene the bestower of Eterni∣ty, and the dispensatrice of the de∣stiny of Kings, finds her selfe now punished with justice, to gaze upon a Queen, for whom she cannot find words, which may answer the dig∣nity of the subject; for whom the worlds brightest Luminaries, I mean persons of the greatest quality, have been either obliged to hold their peace, when they would undertake to speake worthily of her, or else contented with an imperfect Orati∣on, and a true acknowledgement, that they can conceive more then they can utter: but yet neither their conceptions nor their imaginations, can, without a manifest in sufficien∣cy, signifie the smallest part of her perfections.</P>
<P>So it is, Great Queene, that unless you please to condescend, and so
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>obscure your person, we cannot, in that prodigious elevation, where you are fix't, take notice of you, but with that reverence, wherewith we apprehend the glorious Intelli∣gences, who have no communica∣tion with mortals: The comparison holds well; for those celestiall crea∣tures are of a nature pure like yours; your vertues are great like theirs; and you as well as they do suffer, without indignation, men to speake of your Maiesty in tearmes, that carry no proportion to your great∣nesse. It is that resplendant good∣nesse, which makes you proffer those illustrious hands (accustomed to carry Scepters and sustaine Crownes) to all those who have the honour to approach your sacred person. You can receive all favour∣ably, though they should bring nothing but a little water in their hands, a present which a poor Per∣sian
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>once offered to his thankfull Prince.</P>
<P>These are the glorious reasons, my Lords, which have put me in the way, from which I began to wander, and have throughly con∣firm'd me in the designe which I have taken, to give you a Character of that divine Princess, who puts a Confidence into all that approach her with feare, confirmes them that tremble in their respects, and encou∣rageth those, whose Modesty per∣mits not their eyes to enjoy the free∣dome of Nature. Let us draw neere therefore, but let us draw neer with hearts sanctified, and with expres∣sions not intending so much to be choise, as purified from all that, which might ecclipse or diminish the lustre of a vertue so eminent. Let us approach with the same hu∣mility as men pay to the Deity, since we must come to a Queene,
<PB N="9" REF="13" MS="y"/>who is the most glorious Type and magnificent Copy of that invisible Originall. But if our small merits, the great defects that are in us, and a thousand other considerations, be stil our impediments, let us imagine that heaven takes a pleasure to hear her name sung, though from the mouthes of Infancy and Ignorance; and lastly, consider, that we cannot speake of any thing that is great, when wee begin to discourse of the Great Christina.</P>
<P>Those who have a resolution to pron ounce the Elogy of any illustri∣ous person, after they have intrea∣ted their Auditors to afford them a favorable silence, and honour them with a calme attention, they are u∣sually accustomed to cut off those things that are farre from their matter, and yet to speake not a lit∣tle of the fathers of those upon
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>whom they build their discourse. But I shall not tread in their steps, for it is impossible that any should live ignorant, that the father of our Princesse, was the greatest King and the greatest Conquerour in the world. All mouthes have said it; all tongues have pronounced it; all hearts have agreed to it; and all people have confirmed it: what then is it, that we can produce to enter∣taine your eares, which hath not a thousand &amp; a thousand times been spoken of that illustrious Monarch, whose actions and invincible cou∣rage attracted the admiration of all those, who were so happy as to see him fighting. Neverthelesse (by the way) wee may glance upon that, which our Histories of France have gloriously preserved: It is recorded that this good King, a little before the pale hand of Death had seized upon his person, being inspired by
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>some prophetick thoughts, told his people that they would be the cause of his death, being they put too great a confidence and security in his courage; for, they began to judge him immortall, by those im∣mortall actions which they had seene him performe, and the perils to which with an incredible suc∣cesse, hee had exposed his sacred person. This was a prophesie in its effects too true, and deplorable to as many as were Christians: and without doubt God to chastise our pride, and put us in minde of our brittle constitutions, summoned up to heaven that pure vertue, in the flower of his age, after he had plen∣tifully adorned him with blessings here below, &amp; had made him carry with him, the two glorious and de∣served titles, of a King and Prophet.</P>
<P>But let us travel no farther; let us not touch that Marble and that
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>Jaspar, which have beene fashioned by the most ingenuous workmen of our age; let us rest fatisfied that we see him live in her, who so happily enjoyes his Greatnesse; and, if by one excellent name we would eter∣nize, and render him the Admirati∣on of all the world, let us say he was the worthy Father of our Queene: But! when I say he was the father of our Queene, what can be said that hath not beene already spoken, and drawne from him by an infallible consequence? since it is not possible, that the incomparable Christina, could have a father lesse heroique then Gustavus the Great, or that the Great Gustavus could have a daughter more excellent then Christina. Both of them are the miracles of their Sexes; both, the Terrours of their age; and both the Admiration and delights of their people. But there is this difference
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>betweene them. That if Gustavus hath been the Model of the perfecti∣ons of Kings, if he alone hath en∣gross't all those vertues which the greatest Princes of our age, could have wish't to have enshrin'd in their owne breasts; yet Christina enjoyes the higher preferment, and hath not only been the Coppy of that King, whose dignity she posse∣sseth, but laso the illustrious Abridgment of all those vertues, that conduce to the accomplish∣ment of Kings and Queenes, Sub∣jects and Soveraignes. This Throne could not be furnished with a more emient person, this faire Scepter could not be managed by more glorious hands, and these Crownes could not be set upon a head more beautifull and more sufficient; for such a burden would have oppress't any person, that had beene lesse re∣solv'd, or lesse discreet then you.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<P>It is not at all my endeavour to relate, how she hath attain'd to all those endowments, wherein her soule glitters with an extraordinary brightnesse; &amp; though I ought (that so I might hinder persons from being surpriz'd at the infinite great∣nesse of her merit) to begin the History of her life from her Cradle: yet I will not say any thing of the Infancy of a Lady, whose age never found its parallell, who could rea∣son as soone as speake, and whose vertues did not attend, but out∣strip the course of her yeares: but seeing it is the Queene of Sweden of whom I speake, I will not set her forth to you but upon a Throne, nor will I say any thing of the Princess Christina; till her ability to govern hath adorn'd her with a Diademe.</P>
<P>If I were to make an Oration be∣fore a strange Court, or if I were to speake to persons, who have not
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>had the honour to see, and discourse of the naturall Graces of this Prin∣cesse; I might haply at this time have found an occasion to deliver the description and Idea of your beauty, while I explaine that of your person: but it would argue me to be a man of a shallow Judg∣ment, and so no consideration to draw a bad Coppy in a place, where the Originall can be its owne Ora∣tour and appear with so much lu∣ster. Let us only say, that she hath a Character of Greatnesse and Maiesty stamp't in her forehead, which com∣municates it self to her very pict∣tures; and so reflects upon those, who regard them, that is imprints in them a Reverence, full of respect and feare. But it is not only the comelinesse of her person that sets her forth with so much approbation, but also the Greatnesse of her Soule, the Noblenesse of her inclinations,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>the Generosity of her heart, and the Sharpness of her wit. But let us take a view of that which fals into the apprehension of our senses: she delivers herself to all the Ambassa∣dors that come to her Court in the language of their owne Nation; but with such a facility, such an Elo∣quence, and such a grace; that it quickly calls up their admiration. Her knowledg is not limited only to the understanding of forrein Languages, which she speakes as fluent as her owne, but there is no Science in which she is unlearned. She hath an unalterable Stability in her resolutions, a Faith inviolable to her Allies, and in a word, the whole stock of Royall vertues stand united together in her faire soule. This is she that hath lately chased the Imperial Eagles, and defeated so many Armies, to establish that Religion, which those furious per∣sons
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>endeavored to suffocate: and this is she that hath given breath to those Princes, who had put themselves under her protection; that hath broken the forces, which that proud Family had prepared in Germany; and lastly, that hath restor'd that Country's liberty, which was so neere threatned with a cruell ser∣vitude and slavery. Heare me, O Germany; I say, it is not to any but this blessed Queene, to whom thou stand'st indebted for all the joyes, and all the delights of thy peace; it is she that hath stopped the course of thy blood; it is she that hath fil∣lited up thy envenomed woundes with her owne royall reliefe, which she never spared when thy safety begg'd it.</P>
<P>So glorious a travail, so long a warre, and so many advantagious victories, doe well deserve, That repose and divertisements should
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>follow, That magnificence should deck their palaces, and that Their warlike and tumultuous thoughts should be converted into peace and tranquillity. And now there cannot be but a great pleasure in the fruits of victory; To be attended by the blessings of the people, to receive the Homages of Princes restored to their liberties, and, in a word, to be courted by the acclamations of all Europe, and the whole world: This we have hitherto seene, upon the forceing of Citties, defeating of Armies, &amp; conquering of Crownes. She hath inherited the Realmes and provinces of the Great Gustavus: she hath enjoyed by a naturall suc∣cession, the beauty of his spirit, and the Graces of his body: but above these qualities of succession, and hereditary Graces, she hath acqui∣red a large addition of her own. She is both modest and magnanimous,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>eloquent and learned, gracious and Majesticke, her beauty is also a beauty illustrious and full of splen∣dor, a beauty of command, a beauty of action, and (which is more, a beauty couragious and masculine; but to adde something that is great∣er then all this, it is the beauty of a Princesse. Her proportion is perfect, her Countenance confident, her Decorum lofty and daring, her Eyes shining and full of fire, and all her exteriour parts equall to those which painters give to vertue and victory. Al which happy ornaments render her to the view full of Dig∣nity, and an Authority no lesse a∣greeable then comely, which can perswade without speaking, and subdue soules with lookes. Yet to encrease your wonder, this body which is so perfect, is inhabited by a spirit that excels it, and which sits there, like a faire Intelligence in a
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>beautifull Planet. She is expert in the Science of Princes, and there∣fore in her owne: She is skilled in Politicks, and the art Military: she equally enjoyes the knowledge of all those things that are suitable and profitable. She is so well read in History, as well in the one as the other, as well in the Ancient as the Moderne, as well in that of the Church, as that of the World, that she her self is the very Annales a∣bridg'd: and in this she hath out∣shone the glory of the most illustri∣ous Conquerours that were as re∣nowned by their pennes as their swordes, and who at night compos∣ed in their Tents, whatsoever in the day time they had performed in the field.</P>
<P>But let as passe-by these ambigu∣ous Elogies and these equivocal Titles, we have som that are proper and particular. Let us not only say
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>that Christina is descended from a long succession of Kings, that Crownes and Scepters have beene for many ages the portion of those her Ancestors, who have been en∣rowled in the throng of that illu∣strious Family; this is a praise in which she shares with other Princes, and in which other Kings may have a propriety as well as she. There is none but would perceive a vanity in such strange commendations. Let us not seeke any thing of that na∣ture for our Queene, who hath them as her proper and naturall en∣dowments: let us not throw away our praises upon glasse and a coun∣terfeit brightnesse, where we can entertaine our eyes with so many Diamonds and so much lustre. Let us rather say that she hath a heart more high, a soul more Royal, and a Reason more soveraigne, then all those Kings and Queenes, from
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>whom she drawes the greatnesse of her Original. Let us not esteeme of that beauty, which is as well com∣mon to the Poppy as the Rose, as well to the unruly as the chast, as well to the luxurious as the modest; but of that, which is vertuous and well disciplin'd, of a good report and a faire example. Let us not praise her Graces, nor her Judg∣ment; but let us extoll the modesty and continency of her Graces; let us commend the greatnesse and equality of her Judgment. Let us not speake of her Liberalities, since there be persons both liberall and unjust together; or else let us say that they are in her choise, and done with method. In fine, let us admire the veneration, which she continually hath for all persons, that have made any progresse in know∣ledge or vertue: witness, those harmlesse Intelligencers, which she
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>hath in all places of the world, to take notice of those, who are en∣riched with any extraordinary me∣rit: these are they whom she truly lookes upon, as subjects worthy her Liberality: and I am sure there was never any person that did not re∣spect her as much, as if she had beene his lawfull Queene: Also the Muses, especially those in the French lauguage, have not beene wanting to extoll the greatnesse of that ver∣tue, which hath so well rewarded them; And certainly they would be very ingratefull, if they should not commend, or if they should deny such iust acknowledgments to her, who is so favourable to them, and who hath prevented their wants, by a supply from her owne benefits: This Princesse is the cause why they are altogether so triumphant, for she entertaines them as her familiars and companions, she sports with
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>them in prose and verse, but the pastime never concludes without some present, which produceth a smoothnesse in their periods, and puts life into their stanza's,</P>
<P>But let us traverse her Royall vertues only, &amp; seeke those which altogether compose the Abridg∣ment, and frame up the Idea of an accomplish't Queene: for we would not have our Reason sticke in one place, or imploy all its endeavours about one thing, where she may elect so many, that are equally wor∣thy to be chosen. It is impossible that we should praise all the ver∣tues of our Princesse in singulars, because our eyes cannot so well distinguish them among so great a multitude. But she hath some that are reserv'd and particular, which are therefore the more considerable, because they are lesse common, and because they are such that when we
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>once know them, our eyes are too feeble to looke upon them with a fix't aspect, or to see them in all their dimensions there are con∣stantly some of divers orders and divers degrees, some of all Sexes, as well as of all Ages, of all conditions and of all times, of Majesty and hu∣mility, and lastly, the ornaments both of Princes and subjects. These which are of the latter and nobler ranke disperse their blessings about the Nation, and are of foure sortes; Justice, Prudence, true-Glory, and Piety: These are the foure wheels that guide the revolutions of Em∣pires, and constitute the destiny of Monarchies. The first maintaines peace in the Nation, renders to every one his owne, and secures the poore from oppression. The second dives into, and dissipates the Coun∣sels of enemies, prepares them for ruine, and assures a quietnesse in the
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>State, as well by the strength of the mind as the courage of the hand. The third drawes a reputation from all things. And the last crowns the endeavours of all the rest. Our Queene enjoyes them all, but not after that rate, as they are possess't by the world's greatest Princes, who preserve them only as servants to their passions; They make their Cruelty to passe currently for the effects of Justice; they imagine their breach of faith and subtilties, to be a weighty argument of Pru∣dence; their pride and disdaine, to be the materials of a true Glory; and lastly, their infamous Supersti∣tion and shamefull Idolatry, to con∣stitute the exactest and best ordered Piety. But our Christina is ignorant of these adulterate vertues, and counterfeit vices: Disguise and Dissimulation are the two evils which she principally hates and
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>derides: and yet when those appeare in another, she hath so great a reach that she can unvaile and unmaske their darknesse. In this manner she hath reclaimed those faire, though stragling vertues, which had beene long banish't from the Courts of Kings and Princes, and which at last have attain'd an Asylum, under the protection of this adorable Queene, who hath extended her welcomes to relieve those amiable prostrates. This is she who is the true Pole of the Christian world, whereon the whole Catalogue of beauties are displayed; it is she that hath such an attractive vertue, as can allure to her obedience, the most stubborne and rebellious soules, if they be but once touch't with that divine Load stone.</P>
<P>That Justice which is only morall, is (to say truth) nothing else but an authoriz'd opinion; it is a cruell and
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>unmercifull Tradition; it is a lawful offendor and in the scrupulous ob∣servation of Mine and Thine, suf∣fers with unrelenting thoughts the dearest persons to be despis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and ruin'd. But that of our Queene is of another constitution it is an up∣right, an all-seeing, and a gentle Justice, but yet a Justice that was alwayes absolutely perfect. And we can resolutely say, she is so just as to shake off all her choicest Inclinati∣ons, rather then to doe the least wrong to the meanest of her Sub∣jects: and if this vertue which is the foundation of all the rest, findes at any time any resistance to hinder the carrying on of its resolutions, it is only her Clemency, that enclines her pardon to reach some notorious Malefactor. In a word, all her acti∣ons are so curiously cemented to the high severity of Justice, and the calme sweetnesse of Mercy, that a
<PB N="29" REF="23"/>thousand happy results spring from these two Vertues, and make her equally feared and loved by her people.</P>
<P>That prudence which the world breathes, and the Kings of the earth put in practice, is usually no other then an instructed and disciplin'd Malice; it is nothing but a vertue tempered with flegme, and managed with artificiall motions. But that of Christina is so purified as well with∣in as without, that it expels all Forgery and Deceit, and knowes not what is mean't by being capti∣ous or doubleminded: One may relye upon her word with more assurance then upon the oathes of others Her Lights cannot be false, being derived from so much Noble∣ness, and an Originall so pure and cleare: they cannot be erronious, being sprung from so much Justice, and aiming at a conclusion so right
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>and so honourable. She with her owne person is assisting to all her Councels, she is throughly instruct∣ed in all her affaires, and under∣stands them so admirably, that there is not a person can taxe her proceed∣ings; nor can any one reproach her, that by any neglect or slacknesse she hath with-held any thing for base ends, or that she ever sought to secure her actions by an artificiall prudence. And though she alone supports the burden of her estate, yet her ingenuity is so quick and piercing, that she is not at all en∣tangled in the greatnesse of her im∣ployments: her vast Genius, which might governe the whole world, and her able Prudence to which all the kings of the earth might confi∣dently and with great assurance, deliver up the conduct of their whole Estates, findes not any thing in the largnesse of her dominions,
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>that can be altogether her imploy∣ment. What is there then that can be compared to the situation of a soule, and the ability of a wit, that can dive into the bottom of all things: for prudence hath given her a looke beyond others, hath fix't her in a seate that over-awes fortune, and is of such force that we may well say Agamemnon had reason in his ordinary wishes, to desire rather ten men as circumspect as Nestor, then as valiant as Achilles: for in effect that petty Prince of a poore Iland, having attaine'd the favour and guifts of the prudent Minerva, was the principall author of the surprizing one of the grea∣test Citties, that the world ever knew.</P>
<P>The love of glory suites well with those vertues, which are in heroique persons; it breathes spirit into their actions, and spurs them forward to
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>performe great things, for no other consideration, then, That they doe them. This is that only vertue which is not at all mercenary, and scornes to demand any thing for recompence of service done to the Republick, unlesse, the glory to have served her freely and without reward. Those glorious Romans, whom History makes us (as'twere) to see to this day, were all possessed by this humour, when they enter∣priz'd those famous actions, of which yet the very memory af∣frights us. They would attempt &amp; bring to passe, things that were ap∣parently impossible, and whose only mention would strike terrour into the greatest Princes of our age. Ancient men would appeare in the Armies, they'd seeke out a multi∣tude of Combats, so to draw on the occasion of a battel, and, among a thousand dangers, they'd still labour
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>how to be imploy'd in the grea∣test.</P>
<P>But why doe you thinke they hunted after so many perils and Combats? would you have me tell you the reason? It was to obtaine a Triumph, to behold their Statues fix't in the publick view, and to purchase to themselves a new and honourable Name. But yet this Statue served for no more then an unprofitable Marble, and this name augmented not their fortunes, but only in the addition of three or four Syllables. After the same manner were those Recompences that were bestowed upon the Illyrians, Mace∣donians, Numantines, Achaians, Africans, and many others, who for these things only, have willingly beene prodigall, both of their paines and blood, to promote the credit of their Countries. But our Queene li∣mits her glory by a conclusion farre
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>more illustrious: Vanity swels not her soule; but Generosity only, makes her the performer of so many noble actions: It is not at all to get a fresh addition of Titles, or procure her self a new name, for she can not pitch upon a choice more faire or more famous then her owne; but it is for the only reputation, To have done nobly: There never ap∣pear'd a glory comparable to her's. The envious and the mistrustfull would make us beleeve that the Graces could not well be linkt with the Vertues, and that the faire and the knowing, prov'd very seldome to be the chaste and the modest. But she hath given the lye to those mu∣tinous and suspitious persons; and those who have talked much of Elizabeth of England, Marguerite of France, Eleanor of Spaine, Bea∣trice of Portugal, have not adven∣tur'd to compare them to so cleare
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>a reputation. Vertues us'd in their Mediocrity, are usually the subjects of Envy: men impute crimes to them, of which they are altogether Innocent, or at least slenderly culpable: the smallest blemish, and the smallest irregularity, doth ordi∣narily procure some advantagious colour for a reproach. But! that of Christina is of another degree, and of another composition; she sits en∣thron'd above the reach of Calum∣ny, in a word she is all celestiall, all pure, and all divine. Who can then find fault with her, who is more illustrious then Augustus or Livy, more wise then Cornelia, more faire then Helen or Cleopatra, and in fine, more chast and more pure, then all the Sybils of Greece, or the Vestals of Rome. She hath in her self the true resemblance of Zenobia, Eu∣doxia, Amalazonta, and all those things, that even to these happy
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>dayes the world hath seene to pro∣ceed from the most illustrious and greatest Hero's.</P>
<P>But let us discourse a while of that raigning and Victorious piety, and of that Christian devotion, which the faire name of Christina defines so perfectly. Tis without doubt a proud and profane piety, which the great ones practise; they make it only serve their affaires, and use it no farther then their interest ob∣liegeth them. But Her's beares no likenesse to these ordinary pieties, nor to those devotions which are only for show, and consist altoge∣ther in appearance: Her's are of a higher elevation, and warm'd by a zeale, much differing from those, who limit their meditations to a seeming modesty, and signify them in three or four teares, squeez'd from their eyes by force. Her Reli∣gion is not a precise, nor conceited
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>Religion, it is neither scrupulous nor profane. But farre otherwise is that of those artificiall and disguised penitents, who compose their moti∣ons, and proportion their Gestures, to the eyes and observation of o∣thers, who have their Countenances musing, their faces moist with teares, and pray only because it is a custome; and in fine, who mock themselves in private, for that which they had done in publike, and laugh at those persons in their Clo∣sets, before whom they had play'd the Counterfeits in the Church. But Christina, totally averse from this Hypocrisy, drawes from the bot∣tom of her heart, the fire, the In∣cense, and the victime of those sacri∣fices, which she offers: and, which is more agreeable to the Infinite Maiesty, then all the Gummes of the earth and sea, and which plea∣seth his palate more, then the fat
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>and blood of murd'red flocks; she alwayes presents him with the con∣trition of a heart that is soveraigne, with the humility of a head that is crowned, with thoughts humble and full of worship, and with an Authority, not only submissive but also religious. Her goodnesse yet passeth farther, and her aime is much more excellent then report pro∣claimes it; her care and endeavours move strongly for the propagation of the faith, for the defence of God's name, for the surety of his people, for the peace and quietnesse of her estate, and for the tranquillity of the whole Christian world.</P>
<P>We may also say that this is the common good of her Realms, that it is her piety, which is the Tutresse of her dignities, the Directresse of her actions, and the Overseer of her policies. It is this, from whose advice, all her vertues of warre and
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>peace, as well the rumultuary as the pacificke, as well the outragious as the calme, receive their directions and conduct; and in a word, this is that vertue to which our Princess is so much devoted, that we may call it her commanding vertue. Is it not this piety, and this love of God, O you Swedes, that hath chained For∣tune to your party, when the death of your late king, seemed to set her at liberty? Is it not this that hath established your reputation, which was very likely to follow the recoile of that wavering Goddesse? Was it not she that crowned the ashes of that good Prince, who led victory to his funeralls, who gave resolution and courage to the fainting Swedes, and who made them looke upon their enemies with couragious and terrible teares, and fight with a sadnesse resolute and triumphant, in a time when the miserable a∣ssaults
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>of a matchlesse sorrow, did scarce give her eye the power to distinguish her owne party.</P>
<P>O with what astonishment and ad∣miration together, did the wisest of the earth, and the most sharp witted of that age, looke upon this mar∣vellous Spectacle, when they began to examine, whether their prudence could have beene so capable, and whether their imginations could have mounted so high! when, I say, they considered a young Queene, strugling all alone against so great and dangerous a tempest; when they saw how she had overthrowne her enemies, as young and tender as she was. She made a sure conquest, and brought all things to a faire is∣sue, after an infinite number of vict∣ories and Combats. Thus after the revolution of many yeares, she re∣turned safe to her harbours in spight of wind and seas, loaded with the
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>Colours and Ensignes of the con∣quered, stuff't with their pillage, and adorn'd with a thousand other markes of victory. God relieves those that are his, he distributes his assistance to those that feare him, and he hath made us all see in this example, those illustrious markes of his goodnesse, which he hath al∣wayes communicated to those crea∣tures, in whom he findes the true Symptoms of a sincere piety and a reall devotion. O who of our posterity will beleeve, that in our time there should be a Queene, such a one as the great Solomon could never find in his? who will thinke, that he could breath out his wishes and descriptions for a woman, and yet we to enjoy his desires, and her! Solomon that pompous and magni∣ficent king, did never, in all his glory, see any thing like to our Queene: and he is obliged to con∣tent
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>himself, to have drawne twenty six ages pass't, a faire picture, or ra∣ther a faire imperfection of her, since that all that he hath said in his time of a powerfull woman, was not ac∣complish't but in ours. Behold here then this renowned Queen, whom posterity though never so indulgent to antiquity, will scarce ever take the paines to beleeve; but shee will stagger in her faith, when she under∣stands, that her very infancy had the prudence of old men, the justice of the most just, the glory of soules advanc't, and the piety of Soules sanctified; Will she not rather be∣leeve, judging by the actions of her life, which appeare like so many prodigies, that shee came into the world, high, great, faire, and rea∣dy armed, as once Poeticall inventi∣ons faigned of the wise <HI>Minerva?</HI> That <HI>Alexander,</HI> who is knowne by the name of Great, findes much in∣credulity
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>among us, when we read the History of his life; how at the age of nineteen yeares being then an Orphan, hee by his prosperous valour overcame all difficulties, and scatter'd all those obstacles, that had interpos'd and hindered him, from ascending the throne of his Father; and how at those youth∣full yeares, he assured the possession of his tottering estate, so devided at home, and in confusion with his Neighbours. But what will poste∣rity say, when in a sex lesse vigo∣rous by nature, and in an age lesse advanc't by time, she shall see that which surpasseth those won∣ders, which sprang up in the raign of <HI>Alexander.</HI> If the first found these divisions at home; <HI>Christina</HI> findes her selfe grapling with one of the most puissant families of Europe: If <HI>Alexander</HI> encountred many dif∣ficulties,
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>to establish his dignity, <HI>Christiana</HI> hath beheld her selfe em∣barked in a holy, yet a bloody, War, as soon as ever she attain'd the Throne: The first had nothing to do, but to quell Mutinies; but <HI>Christina</HI> was entangled in heredi∣tary broiles.</P>
<P>Magnificence is yet a vertue of the greatest Souls, and the high∣est fortunes, and is not banish'd from her Court: There one sees nothing, but costly Feasts, one sees nothing there, but innocent Re∣creations and spirituall Pleasures; and if any one desires a liberality that should be pompous and he∣roick, all the world knowes, and many by their own experience can testifie, that this great Queen de∣livers out her bounties so freely, as if God had establish'd her in his room, to deal out his blessings, and enrich those that are his. She doth
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>not onely extend her charity to those that ask it, but to those also, who neither pretend nor expect any thing: she gives much, and de∣layes not; she gives cheerfully, and repents not; and, in fine, Liberali∣ty is a vertue, which she practiseth after so noble and generous a man∣ner, that she stretcheth it so far, as it may be called liberality; and she cannot extend it farther, without making it cease to be a vertue. She doth not at all counterfeit the li∣berall or the magnificent, for it would be a hard matter for her, to keep her selfe from not being so: Therefore she need not struggle for a disguise, or labour to seem that which she is. While she permits her selfe to follow the streame of her own inclinations, she can never fall into any thing, but what is just and vertuous; and therefore her good actions flowing from their Origi∣nall,
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>and not being drawne out by violence, as those of many Heroes have been, nor overflowing their banks, as those of some Prodigalls, are not lesse admired for their easi∣nesse and continuance, than for their lustre and magnificence. Thus she is the honour of her age, and the generall benefit of the world; the <HI>Sun</HI> may sooner wrap his flames in eternall darknesse, and hasten∣ing Rivers stop their motions, then <HI>Christina</HI> cease to exercise her good∣nesse. A renowned person in the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> addressing him∣selfe to <HI>Maecenas</HI> in a Poem, cries out, <HI>Maecenas,</HI> you have given me too much, I am weary with recei∣ving. And truly we may say, that it is only the discretion of those, to whom she distributes her bene∣fits, that can put a stop to her mag∣nificence.</P>
<P>Excesse and Vanity may imitate
<PB N="47" REF="32"/><HI>Christina,</HI> simple naturall Good∣nesse may proceed as far as she; but they must remember, that this greatnesse of courage is not solita∣ry, and without company; all the Vertues do march either before or after, and the very same Fountain, from whence the particular ones draw forth their favours and graces, doth furnish the Common-wealth with benefits and rewards, with counsells and resolutions, with mirth and recreations. But, if we would see where She surpasseth her selfe, and how She is altogether in∣imitable, let us speak of her Spirit; let us say, that among all the passi∣ons of her soul, Love is the most powerfull; but it is the love of Sci∣ences. She is all just, all prudent, all glorious, and all magnificent; but there is something that appears with a presence, greater then all this, Shee's all-knowing too, and
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>one may pronounce her to be as wel the Queen of the <HI>Muses,</HI> as the Queen of the <HI>Swedes.</HI> Her Jurisdiction is as generall and as large over good Spirits, as her Soveraignity is ab∣solute over her People. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is not a Person who is ignorant, of those admirable and clear lights, wherewith the study of Learning hath enrich'd her; nor is there a∣ny, that hath arrived to so great a perfection, as that we should ap∣peal to him from any of her Judg∣ments. She hath so great an insight into the merit of every one, that it would be a very difficult thing for her, to mistake or deceive her selfe.</P>
<P>It is no more a new thing to <HI>Swedland</HI> to have learned people, and persons capable of great mat∣ters, since she hath a Queen who a∣lone possesseth whatsoever the Sci∣ences containe, that is either ob∣scure
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>or much sought after; who can dive into the very center of things supernaturall, so that nothing that savours of goodnesse can be shut up in darknesse or kept from the reach of her piercing soul. She is a Queen, who cuts off time from her own divertisments, and shakes off all imaginable pleasures, to divert her soul after this admirable fashi∣on. We need no more wonder, how this State prospers so well, or by what means it is so marvellously governed, since we in our daies en∣joy that, which <HI>Cato</HI> wish'd for with so much passion, in his ima∣ginary Republick; He desired, as a chiefe means to make States hap∣py, that they might either be go∣verned by Kings that were Philo∣sophers, or by Philosophers that were Kings.</P>
<P>But she that holds the Govern∣ment, is she not yet more then all
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>this, seeing she is not only a Queen and a Philosopher together, but she riseth higher still, and is the Queen of Sages and Philosophers. Lie still then, and sleep in security, for it is she that is your conduct: You need not fear any shipwrack of your hap∣pinesse, so long as she sits at the Helme: You may deride the fury of Stormes and Rocks, for it is not possible that you should miscarry. <HI>Christina</HI> watcheth for you, her Ge∣nius guides you, and her prudence is answerable for your safety. Who would then think, that this great Queen should disrelish her fortunes, who nourisheth so just designes, and who, besides so many great men now living, to whom she com∣municates her intentions, and ad∣mits into her counsells, she yet be∣stowes her houres, and the dearest of her life, upon the hearing of so many dead Counsellors, I would
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>say, so many good Bookes, which instruct her with liberty, and teach her all that, which may ren∣der Queenes illustrious and com∣mendable to posterity; she also un∣derstands them, in whatsoever lan∣guage they speak to her: so that there is nothing considerable, of which this apprehensive Prin∣cesse hath not an exact know∣ledge, or utters not with a good grace.</P>
<P>But who is there, that will not above all things admire those com∣pleat and learned Letters, which she is so generous, as to write to Persons, eminent by their fortunes and vertues. May not one say of her, with more reason then of <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> That a stream of gold flowes from her tongue and her mouth, and that she takes a speciall care to polish that gold, and adorn it with a pleasing lustre.
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>We may say this, and (without mentioning here, those who have rejoyced in so pretious a benefit, and been possessours of so admira∣ble a treasure) we may maintain with astonishment, that she alone can comprehend whole Volumes in a few Lines, and contract great Bookes into small Papers. Her words are so pure, so exact, and so delicious; her sentences so choise, and so ponderous, her expressions so full of familiarity and freedome, and all the flowers of Rhetorick so curiously dispersed through them all, that it may with the same confidence be said of her, as of Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> That the hony suck∣ing Bees were her Nurses; for, she is enrich'd both with understan∣ding and discourse, and hath an Eloquence sweeter, then the treasures of <HI>Hybla.</HI> Her Secretaries in effect are rather Officers in shew
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>then of necessity: She her selfe com∣poseth the most difficult, and the most important Dispatches; and when she would explain her selfe in commanding termes, and a style full of Majesty; or, when she would apply the characters of her favour, and use expressions civill and ob∣liging, she never usurps borrowed thoughts, nor picks words out of anothers fancy; her owne ingenu∣ity presents her with variety of excellent matter, that may either allure affections by courtesie, or compell them by violence. And truly, if there is a place, where Learning is disintangled and me∣thodicall; where Eloquence is or∣derly disposed, and vigorous; where Zeal is pleasing and power∣full; where the Graces are instru∣ctive and edifying, we may secure∣ly say, it is in this great Queen. She cannot content her selfe only with
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>the depth and solidity of her opi∣nion, but she addes also the digni∣ty of expression, and the magnifi∣cence of wordes. She gives a splen∣dor and acutenesse to her sentences, a smoothnesse and lustre to her pe∣riods; and the mixtures which she makes of things, profitable and suitable, is so just, and tempered so to the purpose, that she seemes only to please and divert, when she speaks with soveraignty and com∣mand. There is as much of great∣nesse as Majesty, in all her actions, but this Greatnesse is polished and well managed, and this Majesty is pleasing and full of charmes.</P>
<P>I do not here intend to give you an Analysis, nor to comprise as 'twere in an inventory, all the ver∣tues of this glorious Princesse; and though I should be so daring as to take it in hand, yet my endeavours could never be successefull; for, in
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>the performing of such an enter∣prise, the eloquence of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> would finde an apparent im∣possibility; since the powerfull Genius of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> and the flowery Rhetorick of <HI>Crassus,</HI> never possessed any terme or figure, which could represent what that age was never blest with. But if those great Oratours, whose perswading tongues, did, in their times, entise a∣way hearts, commit violence upon the will, and make soules Prisoners by the ear, could never arrive at any but shallow expressions, and thoughts altogether unfit to set forth our Princesse: What censure will you passe upon my temerity, who have undertaken that, of which I acknowledge them to have been uncapable: I, to whom age hath denyed the experience of those great men: I, who have never ap∣proached the Sanctuary of Kings:
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>I, to whom Nature hath refused all those Graces, which are necessary to this illustrious Matter: And I, who in literature have had but a common and ordinary edu∣cation. Yet I dare say, and my Va∣nity hath a very plausible founda∣tion, that of all those mouthes, which have had the happinesse to praise our Queen, I am he, who will bear her Elogy the highest, and approach neerest to a compleat de∣scription. I know well, Gentlemen, that your attention is awakened, and that you long to understand the effect of my boasting promises, which seem to you to be no lesse a paradox, than the saying of an an∣tient Philosopher of <HI>Greece,</HI> who vaunted, That he could drink up all the Water in the Sea. But I will not hold you any longer in su∣spence, I will not make you linger any more, in expectation of a thing,
<PB N="57" REF="37"/>which I perceive you wish for with so much ardency. Yet, if you think, that when I intend to speak wor∣thily of <HI>Christina,</HI> I ought to produce large Elogies of her beauty, you ve∣ry much deceive your selves; if you imagine, that I must praise her pru∣dence, you are still wide from my aime; or if you think, that I must make long Commentaries upon her vertues, you do not at all compre∣hend the excellency of her merit. See, see, after what manner it is, that I ought to speak worthily of her: When you meet with any deser∣ving person, who shall discourse to you of the Vertues and the Graces, who shall make an illustrious com∣parison of the beauties of the Body with those of the Soule, and who in fine shall introduce Justice, Tem∣perance, Prudence, and greatnesse of Courage, in an elevation so high, as was never yet attain'd by any:
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>say onely one word, and that shall be of greater efficacy then whatso∣ever we have yet expressed: say onely, That our Queen enjoyes all these fair vertues, in a degree more eminent and more illustrious then he hath yet spoken of. But proceed no farther; take not to your self the liberty to say that which you be∣lieve should be added to make the Elogy more compleat, and more accomplish't: for, if there should come a third that should say to you, Our Princess exceeds whatsoever you say; This last is he that would merit the Palm.</P>
<P>When you perceive any of those famous Orators, who, to render the vices odious, indeavour by plau∣sible Invectives and eloquent De∣clamations to represent to you, how disgraceful they are in their nature, how deplorable in the use, and how dangerous in the issue; say,
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>that our Queen hath not one of all these Defects: and you shall com∣prise more in that apt Negation, then if you had called to your aid all the precepts of the most know∣ing Rhetorick. Let us content our selves therefore to acknowledge the extent of that which rejects all mea∣sures; let us rest satisfied with the admiration of that which we can∣not comprehend: let us follow her onely by the view, since no swift∣ness can overtake her; let us see her at a distance and contracted, since we cannot approach so neer to her, as to behold her in all her Dimen∣sions. What man is there, that is not transported with amazement and admiration to this Maiden Queen, who in the first flower of her youth was the general astonish∣ment of the Universe? who is mounted upon a Throne, whose Majesty the greatest Princes cannot
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>paralell, who bears sway over the most Martial Nation of the whole World? who alone carries the bur∣den of her affaires? who is learned, who is knowing, who is just and mercifull to all alike? O what an adoreable person is this, who can sustain upon her shoulders a bur∣den so ponderous, as would make the rest of the world sink under the weight! O the vastness of her Ge∣nius, that can comprehend all that the world knows powerful! O the Divinity of that soul, which ani∣mates so glorious a substance.</P>
<P>I know well, that the Jews have had women for their Judges, Pro∣phetesses, and Generals of their Ar∣mies: The Romans and Greeks have had some, who knew how to Conquer, and bring home Triumph and Victory. All the world will witness, that they have been adored both with wisdom and knowledge,
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>and many States cannot without ingratitude deny them to have been the Redeemers of their Countries Liberty: in fine, the virtue of this Sex is as ancient as the world, and hath produced many fair examples in all Times and Ages. Women have publiquely taught Philoso∣phy and Rhetorick at <HI>Athens.</HI> It was a Woman that succeeded in the School and reputation of <HI>Ploti∣nus</HI> of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Vniversities of <HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Bolognia,</HI> have had some of that Sex <HI>Graduates</HI> and <HI>Re∣gents. Holland</HI> hath lost one lately, whom they did esteem to be their tenth Muse: and to say nothing of those whom Orators &amp; Poets have had for Competitors and Rivals; there is not a Nation who hath not embalm'd in History, some female Hero's, or warlike Amazons: But I am fully assur'd, that all those things which can be said of the fair
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>qualities of this Sex, meet happily assembled in our Queene. She hath the admirable Justice and Piety of those illustrious Jews, who were both Warriers and Prophetesses; She hath the courage of those victo∣rious Greeks; and the power of those conquering Romans; She hath all those affections for her peo∣ple, that those generous Mothers of their Countries could be capable of: In fine, She enjoyes all that large capacity and profound learning, which added splendor to those wise and knowing Women, who with honour suppli'd the places of learned men and Philosophers. But if she alone hath all the vertues of all the others together, don't think, O men, that she can have the least defect in any of them in particular! nothing less then that; every thing shines in her with an unspotted flame; but let me onely say, that
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>she is good naturally, that she is al∣so good by industry, and it will suf∣fice to stiffle all those thoughts, which may hinder you from rend∣ring justice to her glory.</P>
<P>It is certain, Great Queen, that all that which we are about to say, cannot be suspected for flattery, none can ever reproach the excess or swelling of our words, they may blame rather our sterility then our abundance, seeing that at this day the eyes of all Europe are fix't upon you, and there is not a mouth, if it have but the smallest relish of Chri∣stianity, which makes not you the object of its blessings. You are the Model of Kings, but it must be meant of good Kings, and not of Tyrants, not of those who lay op∣pressions upon their people, and enforce them to stiffle their Religi∣on, but of those onely who establish it by their example, and whose
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>moderation renders them the de∣lights of their people; these last are they to whom you are the ordi∣nary entertainment; and it cannot be but a sweet satisfaction, that so many Soveraigns, and so many il∣lustrious Princes, should descend from their Thrones to become your Spectators, and (I may resolutely say, for 'tis no more then truth) to become your Adorers: That Con∣sort cannot but be harmonious, which springs from the noise and acclamations of so many victorious persons, who applaud you with their Palms, which though peace∣able and clear from blood, are as worthy as those stained and tumul∣tuary ones, which you have gained in the common dissention of Eu∣rope. And truly 'tis no small glory for you to have out-gone whatever Histories and Annales have for six thousand years produced, fullest
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>of renown and astonishment; for in all those acclamations which your Armies afford you, your re∣putation gains a greater height and lustre, from your vertue, which is so victorious over hearts, than from that fortune of yours, which hath been glorious by so many Armies defeated, by so many Journies and Battailes obtained, and by so many Towns assaulted.</P>
<P>And you, Noble Princess, the illustrious Pillar that sustaines the welfare of this Monarchy: You, my Lords, who have gloriously Conquered &amp; triumphed over your enemies: You, who under the Great <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> have beene alwaies Invincible, and alwaies Vi∣ctorious under your illustrious Queene: You, (I say) who have so often besprinkled her glorious Palmes with your blood, who have made them thrive in the shade of
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>your victorious Armes, and who have engraff't her Trophies upon your sweat, and painful Travels: nay farther, You whom she calls with Justice her Right hand: It is a glorious thing for you to have brought into subjection, so many people both within and without <HI>Germany,</HI> both upon Sea and upon Land, to have forced all those ei∣ther to bend or break, who would have resisted your valour, to have cleared your Frontires, and added whole Provinces to the flourishing Empire of your Queene; to have made him tremble, to whom a spi∣rituall Tyranny allowes the vanity of wearing a Triple-Crown, and to compel soules to the Chaines and Shackles of a miserable servitude: And in fine, to have humbled that proud Family, who had for a long time fore-cast the foundations of an Universall Monarchy, which you
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>have brought downe to the lan∣guage of Petitions, and have con∣strain'd them to ask that peace which they denyed to others with abundance of rigour.</P>
<P>And you, my Lords, who have interpos'd with your weighty Counsels, who have mark't out the delineaments of those glorious en∣terprises, and have carti'd away the praise of beginning that with your Braines, which others have execu∣ted with their Courage. It is no small glory for you to make an e∣quall division of your Palmes and Lawrels, since that you have all consorted and conspir'd so advan∣tagiously for the welfare of your Country. But after all, when you, illustrious Warriors, shall have car∣ri'd away more Victories, then you have yet done; when you shall have over-throwne all the Empires, which you have yet but shaken,
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>and then triumph over all the world; when you shall have char∣ged with Chaines so many Kings, whom you shall make your Pri∣soners, and lead them to the feet of your Queene: And you! when you shall have given Counsels yet better, if it were possible, then those you have hitherto given, when they shall be put in practice; and (to carry the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter a little far∣ther) when all events shall be sub∣mitted to the prudence of your reasonings; you shall then have a glory more magnificent and signifi∣cant then all that; which is, the glory to see <HI>Christina.</HI> O happy peo∣ple! O happy Nation, that can enjoy such a Queene! happy is that Generosity, which can be sa∣crificed to her service! happy Lords! happy Commons, that can live under so delicious a Govern∣ment, and behold in their dayes so
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>many successive wonders! happy Earth, that can be the supporter of a burden so worthy, and a weight so well ballanced! happy Pole, which disperses from above, such sweet and delightfull influences! happy Starres, which have beene the Ascendants of a Constellation so blessed, and a birth so favour∣able! but more happy yet is Hea∣ven, from whence all blessings fall upon your heads in so plentifull a shower. As for me, I confess, that after so many learned men, who have composed the Elogy of the most Renowned Queene in the World, I ought to have tooke it into my Consideration, either to have held my peace, or to have spoken something that might have answered the merit of my Subject, and to have recompenced you for that calme and continued patience, wherein you have wrapped your
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>attention. I had also beene in doubt whether I should have obeyed my first resolutions, and so slept in si∣lence; but a glorious Emulation, and a lawfull Envy, confirm'd my thoughts in this liberty. It grieved me much, when I perceiv'd how the praises of this adoreable Prin∣cess, was promoted among all peo∣ple and Nations, and Celebrated in all sorts of Languages, and that the <HI>French</HI> onely, the <HI>French</HI> I say, which is so much oblig'd to her, and which this Princess hath che∣rish't as her owne, should be alto∣gether silent in this matter. Truly 'tis this reason which makes me choose rather to speake to you in <HI>French,</HI> then in any other language; it is this which hath emboldened me to ascend into this place, and given protection to my weaknesse. It is true, that this most illustrious Lord, whom the Common-wealth
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>of <HI>England</HI> hath sent hither, and that train of Nobility which attends him, have much contributed to the naturall disposition which I alwaies nourished, to admire the actions of this incomparable Queene. The Benedictions of so many religious vowes, which all of them in par∣ticular have made for her prosperi∣tie, are manifest by experience: Also it would not have beene pos∣sible for me to have confin'd with∣in my self, those happy acclamati∣ons and wishes, which all <HI>England</HI> breathe forth for her advantage. Do not suspect that my words are couch't in a disguise, they are nei∣ther dissembling nor servile: they carry the hearts of persons that are truly free, and from whom Tyranny can force up nothing of unworthy flattery. This puissant Republique, which makes a world by it self, and which with the helpe of <HI>Swedland,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>might give Lawes to the whole Earth, produceth nothing, but what is of desert and value. If she knowes how to chastise those, who raise themselves against the glory of God, who pervert his service, and oppress their people: She also knowes how to heape her Benedi∣ctions and Praises upon good Kings: With these she endeavours to con∣serve a reall alliance; with them, she intends nothing but an eternall Warre: In a word, She admires the one sort, as much as she detests the other You ought not any more to doubt of this after so glorious a Testimony, explained in this Am∣bassage, which she hath sent to you, and by the worthy choice which she made of one of her most illu∣strious Lords. If that wise Com∣mon wealth had not with much affection, wish't for a good corres∣pondence with you, for the ad∣vancement
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>of Gods honour, and if she had not regarded with admira∣tion the merits of <HI>Christina,</HI> she would not have chosen out the most illu∣strious Person, among the most il∣lustrious, or the most capable among the most capable of all that great Island, which is accustomed to produce so many gallant men: and to speak all in one word, she could not have chosen a person more no∣ble, or more worthy of <HI>Christina.</HI></P>
<P>Let us draw to a Conclusion therefore: my Lords, seeing that all the vertues of this glorious Queene are truly Royal; and that inferiour and private persons, cannot arrive at any that may be comparable to those; since then, they cannot be communicated to any but her selfe, let us admire them as we ought: and if for the better fixing in your memory, what hath been already said, we are obliged to repeat all
<PB N="74" REF="46"/>againe: I'le say, we cannot deliver to your eye a perspective to make you behold those things, than which the Sunne sees none more marvel∣lous: for, if you consider her In∣fancy, you'l find it full of admirati∣on and wonders; if her life, you'l see it replenished with Prodigies and extraordinary actions. The first is one Series of continued miracles; and that little time which hath been drawn from her precious life, hath it not been crowned with a perpe∣tuall interlacing of Victories? And hath she not now undertooke to settle your Repose? May she receive along benefit from that sweet peace which she hath procured you: May she rejoyce a whole age in that fe∣licity which she hath purchased for you. May she also render to Chri∣stianity, those yeares which were due, and which Death ravished from her Father, and your King:
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>and, to shut up all, Let us earnestly beseech the great King of Heaven, that, whatsoever he hath deprived us of in the renowned <HI>Gustavus,</HI> he would add it to the prosperity, to the glory, and to the long and con∣tinued Raign of <HI>Christina.</HI></P>

<L>There's not a half born smile, that salli's from</L>
<PB N="4" REF="48"/>
<L>Your noble face, but brings a prisoner home:</L>
<L>Not one glance falls from you, but what doth flie</L>
<L>Tip't with the powers of Love and Victory.</L>
<L>Here lies a Captive (in's chains fortunate)</L>
<L>Who speakes your praise, though thence he drew his Fate.</L>
<L>Another there, proud of his fetters, cryes,</L>
<L>His heart is fetch't from your triumphant EYES.</L>
<L>There, there's the cause of all, thence 'tis that thus</L>
<L>You alwaies do become Victorious.</L>
<L>Their Globes are with such forcing fires possest,</L>
<L>They can dart flames into the frozen breast</L>
<L>Of a cold Hermit, and with little pains,</L>
<L>Make wanton blood trace in a Cynick's veines:</L>
<L>That which we falsly call a Wart, doth prove</L>
<L>To be the very Magazin of Love,</L>
<L>The strongest Tower of warlike Cupid, whence</L>
<L>He flings his fires, had but the Gyants thence</L>
<L>Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght against heav'n, they quickly mought invade</L>
<L>Th'opposing Gods, &amp; heav'n their Throne have made</L>
<L>All the Artillery of Cupid lyes</L>
<L>Couch't in the piercing lustre of your eyes:</L>
<L>They like sure Agents set his plots on foot,</L>
<L>'Tis he may speak, 'tis they must execute:</L>
<L>They're two great Theaters, Beauty and Love</L>
<L>There act their parts, &amp; in just Triumphs move.</L>
<L>Do you but frown, the stoutest soules are slaine,</L>
<L>Do you but smile they all revive again:</L>
<L>Such power lies in your eyes, that you alone</L>
<L>Can antedate the Resurrection.</L>
<L>The Poets (men, who in their brains comprise</L>
<L>A Mint, where Fancy can coine Histories,</L>
<L>And feign Creations) have so loudly prais'd</L>
<L>The beauties of a Venus, that they rais'd</L>
<L>Her person up to heaven, and gave her there</L>
<PB N="5" REF="49"/>
<L>The glories of a Goddess, and a Star:</L>
<L>But there was no one such, nor could she ever</L>
<L>Attain those beauties which the Poets give her</L>
<L>There's but one way to make their praises true,</L>
<L>To say, They are a prophecy of you,</L>
<L>And then they're all fulfill'd: you onely are</L>
<L>The Goddess that deserves the name of Fair:</L>
<L>You are the rule of beauty, she alone</L>
<L>That is like you, hath gain'd perfection.</L>
<L><HI>Sheba's</HI> great Queen, travell'd to gaze upon home</L>
<L>The glories of the prudent <HI>Solomon:</HI></L>
<L>Had you then liv'd, you might have staid at</L>
<L>And seen as much: he would to you have come.</L>
<L>He'd have despis'd his Buildings, and made you</L>
<L>His onely Temple and Devotion too.</L>
<L>'Mong'st all the Beauties of the loudest Fame,</L>
<L>Your Bodie's built in the exactest frame:</L>
<L>O happy 'bove the joyes of gods, is he,</L>
<L>Whose Stars shall so plo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his felicity,</L>
<L>As to give him a Gem of such high price,</L>
<L>And let him ransack that soft Paradice.</L>
<L>But, stay fond thoughts, where doth your fancy run?</L>
<L>Had you first learned to unstrip the Sun,</L>
<L>And count his Atoms, then perhaps you might</L>
<L>Number those Graces that are infinite.</L>
<L>While I thus strive to set your wonders forth</L>
<L>At full, I drop far short of your great worth:</L>
<L><HI>Ixion</HI> so in his ambition proud,</L>
<L>Look't for a Goddess and embrac't a cloud.</L>
<L>Smile on the Sacrifice that here I bring,</L>
<L>And your acceptance makes it meriting:</L>
<L>Altars of Goddesses bestow a share</L>
<L>Of worth, on th'Incense that is offer'd there.</L>
