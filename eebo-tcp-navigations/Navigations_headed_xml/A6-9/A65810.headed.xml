<HEAD>THE PARITIES OF <HI>RƲSSIA</HI> and <HI>MƲSGOVIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Commerce and correspondencie of humane nature <HI>subsists</HI> by this: <HI>Viz.</HI> that each proper Countrey hath a want which another Countreys Commodity may supply; and a supply which another Countrey may want: so that one part may not say to the other, <HI>I have no need of thee:</HI> Fruitful <HI>Europe</HI> may not say to barren <HI>America, I have no need of thee;</HI> nor rich <HI>America</HI> to poorer <HI>Asia, I have no need of thee:</HI> the fertile South cannot say to the North, <HI>I have no need of thee;</HI> nor the North to the South, <HI>I have no need of thee:</HI> that there should be no Schisme in the great body of the world, but that the several Parts of it should have the same care one for another: And seeing mankind is but one fami∣ly, (for God hath made of one blood all Nations of the earth, for to dwell upon the face of the earth, and hath de∣termined the times before appointed, and the place of their <HI>habitation</HI>) the World a great house, sundry Countreys se∣veral rooms, it is fit that we who are in the Parlour should
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>know the out-lodgings of this great house; and the world be acquainted with it self, before it be dissolved from it self at the day of judgment. That part of the world called <HI>Russia</HI> or <HI>Muscovia</HI> (which hath thought it its <HI>Interest</HI> to <HI>court</HI> us with an <HI>Ambassadour civilly,</HI> whom we have thought our <HI>interest</HI> to entertain <HI>honourably</HI>) hath these peculiar Rarities and Commodities.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Soyle and Climate.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>RƲssia</HI> or <HI>Muscovia,</HI> formerly called <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> called so from <HI>Busse,</HI> in that Language to divide, because it was divided among eight Brethren and Sisters, lyeth Northward to <HI>Lapland</HI> and the North Ocean, Eastward and Southward towards <HI>Tartaria,</HI> Westward and South-Westward towards <HI>Lithuania, Livonia,</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> having thirty Shires far more large, though thinner inhabited then <HI>England,</HI> which are di∣vided into four Jurisdictions, called Chelfirds, or four Ports: This Countrey is in length four thousand five hundred sixty five miles, and in breadth three thousand nine hundred and thirteen; a vast compasse if it were well peopled, that would hardly be well governed by him, or well indured by his Neighbours: Indeed the soyl being slight and sandy all over, and Northward very barren, is much of it a Desart∣wood for wild Beasts, rather then an habitation for Men; only the Emperour garrisons the borders, least an Enemy presuming upon the solitude, might think to have a fair and clear footing for forreign Enemies to fasten on this Coun∣trey, and from thence easily to invade the neighbouring Do∣minions
<PB N="3" REF="3"/><HI>(a thin Meadow being quickly mowed:)</HI> And more∣over the <HI>Cham Tartar</HI> will neither himself plant Townes to dwell there, living a wild and vagrant life, nor suffer the <HI>Ruffe,</HI> who is far off, to people those Ports; though no doubt so vast a Countrey would maintain its people, if the wildness thereof were tamed with husbandry: but these people scorning that their ground should be better civilized then themselves, never suffer it to be manured, being more willing to provide their bread with the Sword then with the Plough: but for seventeen hundred mile Northward, West∣ward, and Southward of <HI>Moscho,</HI> it is fruitful and pleasant for Pasture, Corn, Wood, Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in great plenty: this Coun∣trey is like a piece of Cloth fine in the woof, and coarse in the lists; fruitful in the body of it, and barren in the bor∣ders. For five moneths together, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>November</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> the whole Countrey is covered with Snow a yard or two deep; and with Frost a yard thick, so cold, that if you hold a Pewter-dish in your hand, your fingers will freeze to it, and you must leave your skin behind you at parting: If you throw water up into the air, it comes down ice: if you breath, it will be so thick that it is ready to stifle you with the cold: so that it is usual for poor men to fall down in the streets and marshes; and the Beasts not enduring the wea∣ther in the Desarts, come in troops upon the Cities, and make them Desarts too: Yet towards Summer the Countrey is so fresh and flourishing, the Trees (which are for the most part Fern and Bent) so sweet and beautiful; the Flowers so va∣rious; the Meadows so green; the Birds (especially the Nightingale, which sings more lowd and artificially there then in other Countreys) so merry, that you would think Paradise were started up there on a sudden: The reason of which sudden Verdure is this, that the Snow (which keeps it warm in the Winter, cloathing it against the Frost) melt∣ing in the Spring, doth drench and soak the ground, that it
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>is, as I told, of a sleight and sandy mould; and then the Sun shineth so hotly upon that, that it draweth out the Hearbs &amp; Plants in that great plenty and variety as is at once our <HI>won∣der</HI> and our <HI>pleasure;</HI> the Countrey besides having the ad∣vantage of Springs, Rivers, and Lakes, which are some sixty, some eighty, some an hundred miles in length; and the Summer there is as much over-hot as the Winter is over∣cold. Their Rivers are 1. <HI>Volghu,</HI> arising out of the root of an Alder-tree, and in two hundred miles improving an English mile in breadth. 2. <HI>Neper,</HI> called formerly <HI>Boristher,</HI> is that which divideth the Countrey from <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and falleth into the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea. The third is <HI>Don a Taxais</HI> (the ancient bounder of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI>) which runneth through the <HI>Cham Tartars</HI> Countrey into the great Sea, the Lake cal∣led <HI>Maeotis,</HI> by which a man may go from <HI>Moske</HI> to <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI> The fourth is <HI>Duina,</HI> some hundred miles long, which falls Northward into the Bay of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and hath great Alabaster Rocks on the banks towards the Sea-side; and other Rivers, the least as big as the <HI>Thames</HI> in bigness, and in length far bigger: The Pole at <HI>Moscho</HI> is 55. degrees, 10. minutes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Native Commodities.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THeir Fruits are Apples, Pears, Plums, Cherries, and Cidern like a Muskmelon, but more sweet and plea∣sant, Cucumbers, Goords, Rasps, Strawberries, and Hurtil∣berries, and many other Berries in Woods and Hedges.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P N="2">2. Their Grain is Wheat, Rye, Barly, Oats, Pease, Buck∣way, Isnythu, a grain like Rice, which they sell at three pence a bushelmost commonly, unless rather by reason of the No∣bilities monopoly then the Earths barrenness, there happen∣eth a dearth, and then their Corn is twenty pence a bushel.</P>
<P N="1">1. But the Commodities wherewith they enrich them∣selves, and pleasure other Countries, is, first Furrs of all sorts, as Buck, Fox, Sables, Dun Fur, Mortrones, Ermines, Miniver, Bever, Wulverin, Squirrel, whereof there is transported out of the Countrey by the Merchants of <HI>Turky</HI> and Christen∣dome to the value of seven hundred thousand Rubbels.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Commodity is Honey, whereof besides an exceeding great quantity spent in their ordinary drinks, which is <HI>Mead</HI> of all sorts, and other uses, a good quantity is carried out of the Countrey to the neighbouring parts which have need of it: God hath not given <HI>all Commodities</HI> to one, to elate it with pride, and none to other Countries, to deject them with pensiveness, but there is some kind of equallity between the profits of Countries, to continue Commerce and ballance Trade in some proportion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Commodity is Wax, whereof there hath been transported a millions worth abroad: this Wax is the cask, where Honey is the liquour, and being yellow by Na∣ture, is by Art made white and green; for sight the clearest, for smell the sweetest, for touch the cleanliest; useful in Law to seal Instruments; in Physick to mollifie Sinews, ripen and dissolue Ulcers; the ground of all Searcloaths, called so from <HI>Cera</HI> Wax: Here are Lakes of Honey found in hollow trees; and Combes eight foot long: the Heaths have the worst Honey, and the Champion the best: the finer the Wheat and the Wool, the poorer the Honey: the best Ho∣ney is lowest in the vessel: <HI>The best Oyl is at top, the best Wine in the middle, and the best Honey is in the bottome:</HI> It
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>opneeth Obstructions, cleareth the Breasts of those humours that fall down from the Head, looseneth the Belly, and hath other good qualities not to be reckoned in a Winters day.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth Commodity is Cow-hides; <HI>Adam</HI>'s first shute was of leaves, his second of leather. It is a common ob∣servation, that when Wheat is dear Leather is cheap; and when Leather is dear, Wheat is cheap: their Losh or Buffe∣hide is large and fair; their Bull or Cow-hide (for they have no Oxen nor Weathers) is small; there hath been transported by Merchants an hundred thousand Hides.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth is their Meath, a drink made of Water, Ho∣ney, and other Ingredients most wholsome for Mans body: <HI>Pollio</HI> being an hundred yeares old, and asked by <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> by what meanes especially he had so long preserved his vigour both of mind and body, answered, <HI>Intus mulso, foris Oleo, By taking Metheglin inward, and Oyl outward.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The sixt Commodity is Tallow, whereof they tran∣sport a great weight; their pasturage being so good, their fasts so many, and their use of Tallow so little; there hath been shipped of this commodity two millions worth to for∣reign parts.</P>
<P N="7">7. As their Beasts fat yeilds them the sixt, so their Fish the seventh Commodity; <HI>viz.</HI> Train-oyl, which they draw out of the Seale-fish, the Sturgeon, the Sterledey, the Sevengu, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they take thus; before Winter they leave their Boats near the Bay of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and at Spring they come and find the fish haunt and sholes, and so environ them and kill them by force, giving warning to all the Companies by firing a Beacon when they have discovered a haunt.</P>
<P N="8">8. Their eighth Commodity is Sturgeon and other Sea∣fish, caught in those Northern Seas in abundance: the little head and Swines back is the sign that these fish are in sea∣son.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<P N="9">9 The ninth Commodity is Flaxe and Hempe, which hath amounted to 800000. yearly, this is sold for cordage, so necessary for us, that it is a common Proverbe when Hempe is spun, then <HI>England</HI> is done; when all that necessary Commodity is employed so that there is no more left for Sailes and Cordages, <HI>England</HI> (whose strength consists in Shipping) would be reduced to a wofull <HI>condition;</HI> and I wonder there is not more Hempe sowed among us since our Land affords so much strong and deep ground proper for the same; here is excellent Flaxe which well husbanded would find Linnen for the Rich, and living for the Poor.</P>
<P N="10">10 Their tenth Commodity is Salt, their best Salt is a <HI>Stararouse</HI> in very great quantity, where they have great store of Salt-wells about 200 miles from the Sea; at <HI>Astracan</HI> Salt is made naturally by the Sea water casting it up in heapes, and so it is digged down, and carried away by the Merchants; this is most essential to mans livelyhood, without which nei∣ther Sacrifice was <HI>pleasing</HI> to God, nor meate savory <HI>to man,</HI> it is placed on the Board with bread, to shew that they are equally necessary to mans sustinance; and it is observed that,</P>
<P N="1">1 Some Countryes have Salt without flesh within many miles, as in the South part of <HI>Africa;</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Some have plenty of Flesh but no Salt to make use thereof, as in many parts of <HI>Tartary;</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 Some have Flesh and Salt, but the Flesh utterly uncapable of seasoning as at <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 Some have Flesh and Salt but the Salt so dear
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>that common people cannot compasse it as in <HI>France;</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 Some have Flesh, caple of Salt, and Salt at an easy rate as they in <HI>Muscovy</HI> and we in <HI>England, Foelices bona si sua norint.</HI>—</P>
<P N="10">10. The tenth Commodity is Tarre which they make out of their Firre Trees, in the Country of <HI>Du∣yna</HI> and <HI>Smolexsho,</HI> whereof much is sent abroad.</P>
<P N="11">11. The leventh Commodity is Oake, when the Spies were sent into the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> among other instructions given them, they had order to make enqui∣ry whether there was Wood therein or not, this Coun∣try affordeth abundance of Wood, excellent for Ship∣ping and other uses.</P>
<P N="12">12 The twelfth Commodity is <HI>Barley</HI> white large plumpe and full of Flower, it is (though not so tooth∣some) yet as wholesome as Wheat it selfe, and was all the staffe of Bread which <HI>Christs</HI> Body leaned upon all his life, eating to attest his Humanity, <HI>Barley loaves</HI> to evince his humility.</P>
<P N="13">13 The next Commodity is Diamonds in black∣nesse and hardnesse for short of the <HI>Indian,</HI> yet set with a good foile (advantaged hypocrisie passeth often for sincerity) may at the first sight deceive no unskilfull lapidary, as their lustre is lesse then Orient Diamonds, so herein they exceed them that nature hath made both their face and their dresse by whom they are pointed and polished.</P>
<P N="14">14 Amber-greese so precious a Commodity as is fixed to no place in the World, as too great a treasure for any one Country to engrosse, and therefore it is only fluctuating and casually found by small parcells,
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, yet much of it is found upon the Coasts of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> it's by some thought to be the sperme of a Fish; by others the royling of sea water; by others a gumme growing on the sea shore, however it is very refreshing for the spirits, and Soveraign for the strengthning of the Head, besides the most fragrant scent, for stronger in consort, when compounded with other things, then when singly it selfe.</P>
<P N="15">15 The fifteenth Commodity is Metall which of all sorts is found with much ado in these parts especi∣ally Iron and it's elder brother steel extracted from the same Oare, differing from it not in kind but in degree of purity as being the first running thereof, it's more hard and brittle then the Metalls of other Countryes.</P>
<P N="16">16 Fish tooth called <HI>Ribazuba,</HI> the powder where∣of is good against poyson, which makes Beades Knives, and swords, Hafts for noble Men and Gentle∣men, two foot in length, and weigh eleven or twelve pound a peice.</P>
<P N="17">17 Neer <HI>Dudia</HI> is a soft Rock called <HI>Slude</HI> which cut to thin peices serveth instead of Glasse and Horne and gives a clearer light,</P>
<P N="18">18 They have Fallow Deer, Roe Bucks great store their Staggs are stately Creatures, jealous and revenge∣full, insomuch that a Stagge unable for the present to master another, who had taken his Hind from him, waited his opportunity, till his enemy had weakened himselfe with his wantonnesse and then killed him; their Flesh must needs be good whose very Hornes are accounted Cordiall, besides there is a concave in the
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>neck of a green headed slagge, when above his <HI>first crosting</HI> wherein are many wormes some two inches in length, very usefull in Physick and therefore lay'd up by many discreet persons.</P>
<P N="19">19. There Beasts of strange kind are the Lash, the Ollen, the wild Horse, the Bear, the Wolvering or Wood Dog, the Lyserne, the Beaver, the Siabt, the Martron, the blacke and dun Fox, the white Bear to∣wards the sea-coast of <HI>Pechora,</HI> the Gurn-state, the Mi∣niver, their Hores and Squirells which are of the usu∣all colour in summer, but the one turnes white, and the other Gray in Winter, some Heathen have causlesly complained of nature as a step mother to Mankind, be∣cause other creatures come into the World cloathed with Furres and Feathers whilest man is exposed naked to the world, I say a causelesse charge because what the Beasts have by nature we wear by art, the Furre they wore when alive, we wear when they are dead.</P>
<P N="20">20 For Birds they have diverse of the principall kind, as Hawkes, Eagles, the Ger-faulcon the slight Faulcon, the Goshawke, the Tasset, the spar-Hawke the storke, the Crane, the Teddor, the Pheasant and Patridge, and the great Owle; <HI>Muscovy</HI> may be called the Aviary of the World, where the wild Fowle are remarkeable for, 1 Plenty, so that some ten thousand small Birds have been caught at a draught; 2 Variety no man being able to give them their proper names, except one should get <HI>Adames</HI> Nomenclator of Crea∣tures; 3 Delsciousnesse, wild Fowle being more dainty and digestable then tame of the same kind as spending their grossy humors, with their activity and constant motion in flying,</P>
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
<P N="21">21 They have all fresh water Fish, as Pikes, the fresh water Wolves, and therefore an old pond-Pike is a dish of more state then profit to the Owners; seeing a Pikes belly is a little Fish-pond, where lesser of all sorts have been contained, although tyrants are short liv'd, yet Pikes live six score yeares, this Fish they say cheweth the Cud, is fine and wholesome, and the less the sweet carps which were brought thence to <HI>England</HI> in King <HI>Hen.</HI> the 8th. time; Trouts, pleasant and wholesome Fish as whose feeding is pure and cleanly in the swiftest streames and on the hardest gravell, they are in their Perfection in <HI>May,</HI> and yearly decline with the Buck, Eeles which loves not the Russe as well he loves them, so true is the <HI>Italian</HI> Proverbe <HI>give Eeles without Wine to your exemies Pilchards,</HI> plenty whereof are taken in these parts, persecuted to the shore by their enemies the sunny and <HI>Hawke,</HI> till in pursuance of their revenge they all become a prey to the Fisher∣man, their numbers are incredible, employing a num∣ber of poor people, in pulling, gutting, splitting powdering and drying them, and then with Oyle and a Lemon, they are meate for greatest Noble man a∣mongst them, <HI>Tenches</HI> Fish that love ponds better then Rivers, and Pits better then either; it's pleasant in <HI>Tash</HI> and is called by some the Physician or surgeon of Fish, it cures the Pike, and therefore the Pike they say spares it; and other Fish, as the Bellonga, the sturge∣on, the severign, and sterledy out of the rowes of which four Fish they make great store of caveare, they have White and Red sammon, a dainty and wholesome Fish, and a double riddle in nature.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
<P>First for its invisible feeding, no man alive having found any measure in the maw thereof: secondly for its strang leaping and shooring it self out of the water an Incredible heigth and Length: and they say it in∣creaseth from a spawn to a full grown fish, within the compasse of a year: plenty of these in their ports though not in such abundance as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where servants they say Indent with their masters, not to be fed therewith above thrice a week—The <HI>Herring,</HI> a fish though Contemptible in its self, Considerable in its company, swiming in such sholes that what the <HI>Whale</HI> hath in bignesse the <HI>Herring</HI> hath in Number: yea red Herrings which in <HI>England</HI> are eated for sauce, to quicken the appetite, serve in these ports for food to satisfy hunger.</P>
<P>The last Commodity is Fustian Kersy and other kind of Stuffes made cheifly in those Ports and thence brought hither.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>There Religion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS for their religion for which we ought to enter∣taine them: Its not depraved by superstition, Idolatry, and usurpation of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> but according the poorer way of the Greek Church, they own the scriptures and the 4 first councells toge∣ther with to the purer wayes of the primitive times: they are governed by one Patrion of <HI>Chio,</HI> and works, by 4 Arch Bishops, by threescore Bishops with there as∣sistants, there Clergy are very ignorant and unwill∣ing to take any paines to teach the people, but they read a Lyturgy, and administer the sacraments: there
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>Lyturgy begins with these words, <HI>Blesse O heavenly Pastour,</HI> meaning Christ, <HI>In the name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Lord have mercy upon us,</HI> &amp;c, then in Chancel, saith the Lords Prayer, and a donology to the trinity: then the Psalms for the day, then they read Chapters: the Commandments, and <HI>Athanasies</HI> his Creed; and then they pray: there children are Baptized within 8 days after they are born: the Sacrament of the Lords∣supper is administred but once a year a little before Easter, very solemnly all going to it with confession of sins: the bread is put in the wine and so administ∣red: there was one endeavour to unite them to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1588. but it failed be∣cause of the many Corruptions in doctrine and disci∣pline which they found in that Church. And at the same time, and ever since they have endeavoured to make leagues offensive and defensive. With all Christian Princes that they might be able to grapple with the great enemy of the faith, the <HI>Turke,</HI> to the advancement of Religion, the propagation of the Gospel, and the conversion of the world: if any object that Religion is not to be beaten into turn with the Dint of sword, yet it may be Lawfull to open the the way force, for instruction, catechising, &amp; such other gentle by means to follow after: however if we do not offend the Infidel, we may defend our selves and a preventive war, grounded upon a just fear of Invasion is Lawful.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Their warlike Furniture.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOr the Incouragement of the souldiery, every Souldier in Russia is a Gentleman, and none gentlemen but the soul∣diers: and when any is of years he presents himself to the great constable who admits him to the service, and alloweth as much Land as his father had: for there is Land to maintaine the Army, &amp; all that are not of the Army must use some vulger
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>wayes to live for they are allowed no Land: the Emperour hath 15000. Horsemen for standing pensioners: and he hath 110. Noblemen who are to find amongst them 65000. horse∣men with all necessaries meet for the war after the Russia man∣ner: and these 65000 Horsemen are to march to the borders of the Chrim Tarter: whether there be warrs with the Tar∣tars or no, and whereas it might be thought dangerous for the Noblemen to have so good forces under there Commands the <HI>Emperor</HI> prevents all Inconveniences, 1. By changing their noble-men as he thinks good. 2. By making them live and depend upon him, they being such as have but a small Estate of their own. 3. And they are seldome souldiers themselves, there charge being only to see the Army Paid. If there be need of any greater number, he entertaines those men that are out of pay, and given charge to his Noble-men, that hold Lands of him to bring into the field every man a pro∣poportionable of his servants and such as till his hand. with their furniture according to the just number he intends to make, when the service being done presently Lay in their weapons, and return to there servile occupations againe, of footmen he hath 12000. whereof 5000 guard <HI>Mosco:</HI> and two thousand attend at Court: the rest he disposeth of in his Garisons, untill he hath occasion for them in the field: And receive for Sallery 6. pound a year apeice, besides twelve measures of <HI>Rie,</HI> and Oales; They employ some 12000. strang∣ers, <HI>Poland, Dutch, Scotch,</HI> &amp;c. upon the borders of <HI>Tar∣tary,</HI> and some <HI>Mercenary Tartars</HI> upon the borders of <HI>Po∣land</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> thinks it pollicy so to use their service upon Contrary borders; the Generall is usually a noble∣man of great extraction, but of mean parts: For in this point, they are very wary that nobility and power <HI>meet not both in one,</HI> especially if they see wisedome withall or apt∣nesse for policy to make up the defect In the Generall, there is some other joyned with him as Leivtennant general of farre lesse nobility, but of far more valour and experience then he in Marshall affaires: who ordereth all things that the other
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>Countenanceth. And he is assisted by 4 Marshals of the field, and these fear have two under each of them, that twice a week at least muster and train their severall wings or bands, and give justice for all faults &amp; disorders Committed, in the Camp: They have a great Master of the Ordinance and a Scout-Master Generall who hath a 1000 men about him to spy abroad; all these Officers must attend the Generall e∣very day, to put him in mind of those things that may con∣cern their offices.</P>
<P>Upon any War the 4 Lords of the Chetsfinds sends their summons to be Proclaimed in the cheif Towns of the <HI>Em∣pire</HI> to all Gentlemens Sons to meet at the boders at such a place, and at such a time to be there Inrolled by certain Officers appointed by the high Constable.</P>
<P>If any man makes default, and faile at the day he is punished very severely; When the Soudiers are assembled they are di∣vided into Bands and Companies, and those Companies are re∣duced into 4 legions under the four great Feild Marshalls who are all under him, who hath a Commission with instructions for the present service, they are armed but slightly with Bow and Arrow and a sword, and here and there one with a Coat of Male; the cheife Commanders go very richly with their Saddles of cloath of Gold, their Bridles fair bossed and tas∣seled with Gold and Silke Fringe, bestuded with Pearle and precious stones themselves in very fair Armour of shining steel yet covered commonly with cloath of gold, and edged round with Ermin Furre, with a steel Helmet upon their heads of great price, these swords, Bows, and arrowes by there sides, their Speares in their hands, with other Helmets, and the Horse∣mens Septer carried before them; the footman hath nothing but his peice in his hand, his striking hatched at his back, and his Sword by his side; every man is to provide for himselfe sufficient for 4 moneths, and if need be to give order for more to be brought to him from his Tenant that tilleth his ground to the Campe, they are prepared to be Souldiers before hand their provision is dryed bread &amp; Bacon with other dryed flesh or fish after the <HI>Duch</HI> fashion: The <HI>Russin</HI> is not so hard to per∣forme
<PB N="20" REF="11" MS="y"/>an enterprize as he is to endure hardship, courage in ex∣ecution failes him partly because of his servile condition which will not suffer any courage to grow in him, and partly for lack of due honour and regard, which he hath no great hope of what soever service or execution he doeth; their marching or leading is without order, onely they keep in 4 legions, and so thrust onward in a hurry, tuhrsting rather to their number then their order, when they give any charge they make a great hol∣low and noise with Drums and Trumpets, and Swords bran∣dished over their Heads, their Footmen (because commonly they want order in leading) are usually placed in some ambush or place of advantage, where they may most annoy the enemy with least hurt to themselves; they have Castles of boards of 3, 4, 5, 6, or. 7 mile length to defend them on both sides from Arrowes, in which they stand and have roome enough to charge and discharge their peices and to use their other Weapons; it is close at both ends, and made with Loop-holes on either side, to lay out the nose of their peice or to push forth any other Weapon, it's taken in peices and laid on Carts, sparred toge∣ther, and drawn by Horses that are not seen, be covered with these carriage as with a pant-house, when it is brought to the place where it is to be used which is chosen out by the walking generall, it is planted as much as the present use requireth, sometimes two miles long sometimes more, which is soon done without the help of any Carpenter, because the Timber is so framed to claspe together one peice within another, as is easily understood by those that know the manner of the <HI>Russia</HI> build∣ing, because of their disorder, the <HI>Russia</HI> are observed better at defending a Town or castle, then at an open War in an open Field; it's thought there is no Prince in <HI>Christendome</HI> hath bet∣ter provision there the <HI>Russia</HI> Emper our; as may partly appear by the Artillery at <HI>Mosco,</HI> where are of all sorts of great Ordi∣nances, all Brasse peices very fair, to an exceeding great num∣ber; a peice of gold stamped with St. <HI>George</HI> hanging on the Sleeves is the reward of the greatest service; Colonies are filled with garrisons, the Inhabitants being permitted upon their good behaviour to till the Land for the use of his garrisons which are maintained at the charge of those Inhabitants.</P>

<P>The Parliament confists of twenty Noble men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and as many Bishops with the Emperor himself; no body representing the people who are looked upon as ser∣vants and slaves, the Clergy men being asked their opinion say; <HI>The Emperor and his Counsel are of great wisdome, and they are not able to advise them: they can onely pray for them according to their duty and calling;</HI> then one of them asks the Emperors mind; the Se∣cretary tells them, that the Emperor desireth them to speak their minds freely; then without any pause they consent, and then the matter agreed on is drawn up by the Secreiaries to Proclamation to be published throughout the Empire.</P>
<P>The Nobility hold all they have from the Emperor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy.</NOTE> and they are kept under by emulation one of the other which the Emperor cunningly improveth to the weak∣ning of the Nobles, who have liberty to destroy and undo one another upon private quarrels, that they may not be able to cope with the Emperor; the Em∣peror pretends to wafile some select men in the book of his Favourites which he shews to others, that they
<PB N="27" REF="12"/>may envy and undermine them; which begets a mor∣tal hatred betwixt them to pleasure the Emperor: he moreover removes them from Country to Country, that they may never gain any love, authority, or po∣pularitie, and their Estates are not above 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year. There are four Provinces, and four Officers be∣longing to them, who attend the Emperor with all the business of those Provinces, and communicate to the Provinces by their under Officers the Emperors plea∣sure concerning them, these Governors hear, deter∣mine, and execute all in the Provinces by Deputies, unless there happen a hard case which they refer to the Emperor and his Councel; <HI>none governs where he is known, or where his Estate is.</HI></P>
<P>These under Officers are permitted to rack the peo∣ple, because they must give their account at the end of their Office, when all that they have taken returus to the Emperors Coffers; few of them but come to the whip when they have done, under pretence of being punished.</P>
<P>There eight special persons of worth and valour pla∣ced in the four bordering Towns, who have large Commissions, because sometimes their occasions are such by the sudden Invasion of an Enemie, that they have not time for direction: the City of <HI>Musko</HI> it self is governed by the King and Councel, only for build∣ings, impositions, keeping the streets clean, there are some inferior Gentlemen appointed with the Alder∣men and Constables; the Noble men are newly raised, and the people so cowed, that there is no likelishood of alteration; besides the Emperor keeps the souldiery to himself by rendring them odious to the people, with whom therefore they never can Close against him; to
<PB N="28" REF="13"/>satisfie the humors of some Noble men, he maketh them Connsellors more for state then any use he makes of them; having some privadoes whom he consulteth day by day about the important affairs of the King∣dom; others coming sometimes who are of greater birth then wisdom, taken in as may seem for that end, rather to furnish the place with their honours and presence then with their advice or Councel. Of the Councel are thirty one besides two Lord Secretaries: the matters they debate are such as are brought to them by the Lords of the Provinces from their several quarters, and the chief Officers of every Office of Re∣cord, who may come into the Councel-Chamber, and inform them as occasion incident to his Office doth re∣quire; besides many private causes by way of suppli∣cation in great numbers are considered by them; they sit about seven a clock in the morning, <HI>Mundays, Wed∣nesdaies</HI> and <HI>Fridaies.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenue.</NOTE> The rents are gathered by the Steward of thirty six Towns with the Crown lands and hundreds belong∣ing to them; these rents are paid partly in money, partly in grain, partly in provision of flesh, Fish, and Foule, the surplus whereof is sold by the Steward to the best hand, and runneth into the Emperors Treasu∣rie, which amounts to, 200000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, which pays wages and Salones, besides this there are sour Officers over the Taxes, gathering first <HI>Tagla</HI> or an imposition on every measure of grain. 2. The <HI>Podal</HI> imposed on every hundred in the Realme, both which amount to 400000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, besides these are Officers for the Custom which amounts to 340000 Rubbles, or makes a yea 160000 Rubbles, being gathered by the first Table of Customers 90000 to the second, and 70000
<PB N="29" REF="13"/>to the third, besides this there is a Mullit arising from every Processe in the Courts of Justice, which amounteth to 30000 Rubbels; the Remainder of Land Rents after the Army is paid amounts to 200000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly, so that there comes a million of mony clear, all charges paid to the Treasury in the Castle of <HI>Musko,</HI> where the Emperors Mony, Plate, Jewels, Scepter, and bags sealed with the Emperors seal; besides forces and other commodities, with confiscation, that a∣mounts to 500000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> more, which are so great that a late Em∣peror would say, <HI>That people were like his Beard, the oftner sha∣ven the thicker it grew, or like sheep that must be shorn once a year at least, to keep them from being overladen with their wool.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="8"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy to improve the Reve∣nue.</NOTE> 1. These Emperors wink at the Officers exaction, until their time is expired that they may have it; they suck the people, and the Emperor sucks them, and seems to make them a publick example (saying, <HI>These good people are they that would eat you like bread</HI>) that they might confiscate their goods, which a late Emperor did, calling an executioner, and bid∣ding him kill a goose, and he cut off the mans legs first, then his arms, then his head, and there (said the Emperor) is a goose ready dressed.</P>
<P N="2">2. They make a shew of want, as this Emperors Father did, who being left very rich, coined his plate and sold it, that he might seem to want mony, whereupon presently out comes a Tax.</P>
<P N="3">3. They encourage the subject to bestow upon Monaste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies all their wealth which they take upon occasion without any noise: this I was told, that <HI>Juan Vasilnwick,</HI> resigned his Kingdom to one, whom he adviled to recal all Charters given to Monasteries, which done he assumed the Government as if he disliked this, and was content to renue their Charters, reserving to himself as much of their Lands as himself thought good, whereby he got 30 millions of mony.</P>
<P N="4">4. They send Messengers to engage the Commodities of the Provinces, buying them at small Rates, and selling them at what they list. And so for forreign Commodities as I remember in the year 1645, when I traded in <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea: and they make a Monopoly of the Commodities he
<PB N="30" REF="14"/>receives for Rent or Custome, and to enhance the price o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them: And none must sell their Commodities till the Em∣perors be all sold.</P>
<P N="5">5. He sets up Drinking-hours, when men spend all their Estates, from which none may be called away, lest they hin∣der the Emperours Revenue, where they lay up some twenty pound a man, and vow not to brave the Pot, until they have spent all, as they say, <HI>for the honour of the Emperour,</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. A Nobleman feigns himself robbed, and the City is fined 10000 Rubbles for its misgovernment.</P>
<P N="7">7. They send for what cannot be had, as for a peck of Flies to <HI>Musco,</HI> and then fine the Inhabitants because they do not what cannot be done.</P>
<P N="8">8. One Emperor fined his Noblemen 30000 Rubbles be∣cause he missed his hour one morning. Their exactions are so great, that I have seen so metimes when they have laid open their Commodities for a liking, to look still behind and about them, whereof asking the cause, I found it to be this, That they doubted some of the Emperors Officers might be in company, and so a traine were laid upon them to prey up∣on their commodities: Therefore they drink and idle away the time (though able enough to endure labour) caring for no more then from hand to mouth. Yet there are some Merchants very rich there, dwelling far from Court, and worth 300000 Rubbles a piece, as I knew their brethren of late. The people are ignorant, that they may be more fit to be Slaves: Therefore in the year 1643 they removed all strangers to the borders, least they should teach the people better Manners, Quallities, and more Wit. And none is to aspire higher then his Fathers Trade.</P>
<P N="9">9.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice.</NOTE> If any one is injured, he makes his supplication either to the Court of Aldermen, or the other two Courts, and thence hath a Writ for the other, who appears and pleads his own Cause, and if Evidence cast him either by Witnesses, or by the Plaintiffs kissing the Cross upon the matter, he is sent to the Serjeant, who irons him and cudgels him on the shins from Eight till Eleven every day, till he payes the money. Their Bills are these: <HI>I William White owe Juan Vasilevel Go∣donor</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="14"/>100. <HI>Rubbels of going money of Musko without Interest, until the Councel Sunday: and if not paid then, I must pay five for six: upon this are witnesses Gab. Jacovile sin, An.</HI> 1662. This Bill have I written <HI>William White</HI> with my name to it. In criminal affairs they examine by tortures. and refer the Par∣ty to King and Councel.</P>
<P N="10">10. They rise about four in the morning, and worship,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pri∣vate beha∣viour.</NOTE> and then to business, and then to their wives, and then to Dinner, where their food is rather plentiful then curious, with which they drink plentifully, after which they sleep two hours daily, which would kill them, but that they sweat it out in hot Baths: out of which they can go to the cold air, yea and water too in the winter time. They allow their women money for paint: They wear Caps close to <HI>their heads, and are shaven,</HI> unless they be in displeasure with the Emperour when they let their hair grow: Over the Cap he weareth a wide Cap of black Furre, with a long Bonnet within it. About their necks, Collours beset with Pearls and precious stones. Next over his shirt, (which is curi∣ously wrought, because he stripeth himself in the Summer time) is a light garment of Silk made down to the knees, buttoned before, and then a close Coat buttoned, and girt with a <HI>Persian</HI> Girdle, whereat he hangs his knives and spoons: over which he weareth a loose Garment of rich silk, furred and faced about with gold lace: Their noice is infinite, who cry, <HI>Give me and kill me.</HI></P>
