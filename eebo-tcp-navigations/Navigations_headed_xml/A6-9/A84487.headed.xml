And the said Committee, or any five or more of them after the claimes are cleared, shall contrive and appoint such a method for the management of all mens lots as to their utmost skill shall be most free from all offence and just exception. And to the end all Adventures for Lands in <HI>Ireland</HI> may have knowledge, and take notice hereof; It is further Ordered, That in Grocers Hall <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> upon the twentieth day of <HI>July</HI> next ensuing, being in the yeare of our Lord 1653. by eight of the clock in the morning this Lottery shall begin.

<PB N="3" REF="2"/> such Adventurers proportion in <HI>Irish</HI> measure doth amount unto: And shall accordingly give unto each of the said Adventurers a Cer∣tificate, what number of Acres (according to <HI>English</HI> measure) is due unto him, either by force of the said Act, or in lieu and satisfaction of his proportion of Acres <HI>Irish</HI> measure, according to the said for∣mer Acts and Ordinances, which Certificate under the Hands and Seales of any five or more of the aforesaid Committee, shall be a suf∣ficient Warrant for every Adventurer receiving the same, to make his claim in <HI>Ireland?</HI> And the said Committee shall cause an entry to be made in a Book for that purpose, of all and every Certificate and Certificates which they shall give to any person or persons, expres∣sing the sum in words and not in figures, the name of the first Ad∣venturer, and of the person to whom such Certificate shall be given, together with the proportion of lands due to him, as the same shall be contained in the said Certificate: and shall cause a Transcript there∣of in a Parchment-Roll to be made and transmitted into the Cham∣ber of <HI>London,</HI> there to remain as a publike Record. Provided al∣wayes, the right of Election for Provinces in the manner of Alot∣ment, be preserved unto such as have, or shall claim the same upon the Ordinances of the fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. And the thirtieth of <HI>November</HI> 1647. And it is further Ordered, That the said Com∣mittee be authorized to receive one penny upon the pound, of and for every Adventurer, for so much land as he shall be entituled or lay claim unto, towards the defraying of all incident charges here for carrying on this service.</P>
