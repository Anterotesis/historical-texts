<P>Of such digested Books no num∣ber is superfluous, though treating of the same subject; For as <HI>Aug∣stine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Trin. l. <HI>1.</HI> c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ʋtile est plures libros à pluribus fieri diverso stilo, etiam de quaestionibus iisdem, ut ad plurimos res perveniat, ad
<PB REF="6"/> alios sic, ad alios autem sic.</HI> It is profita∣ble to have books composed of ma∣ny in a divers stile even of the same question; that the knowledge of the thing may be conveyed to very many; to some after this manner, to others after another.</P>
<P>Now as touching this present discourse <HI>(Non umbraticam causam agimus)</HI> it is not nugatory or need∣less, but presenteth to our view Ho∣nourable and Commodious ends, whose Scope is to blason the Ver∣tue of a Prince, the safety of a Common-weale, and the liberty and tranquillity of the Subject, the three Columnes of publique felici∣ty; and therefore the more to be desired and affected for the excel∣lency of the ends. <HI>Finis enim dat amabilitatem mediis.</HI> For the end gives a lustre and lovelinesse to the meanes. Wherein though I may seem <HI>actum agere,</HI> and to prescribe those things have been discussed by others, yet are not some of them
<PB REF="6"/> without their defects, which may haply here be repaired; For as <HI>Ci∣cero, Recentissima quae{que} sunt emen∣data magis.</HI> Besides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acad.</NOTE> many materi∣al Gleanings are added, and novel Collections, which out of superflu∣ity or security were omitted. How∣soever <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>Quae decies repetita glacebunt.</HI> Good says repea∣ted often do often please.</P>
<P>And it hath been a custome a∣mong all Writers, to season their Dictates with other Sentences, that they may seem not to presume on their own Authority, and write with more certainty, and be read with more delight. <HI>Assranius</HI> was blamed for borrowing many passages of <HI>Menander,</HI> who con∣fessed he had not onely taken from him, but from many others, what was convenient for his pur∣pose, and which he could not better compose; and it is <HI>Plutarchs</HI> judg∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Symp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. To invent, and
<PB REF="7"/> enquire, is reasonable; but to col∣lect out of others, is admirable.</P>
<P>Yet whosoever does insert the inventions of other Authors in his own Editions, and not grate∣fully acknowledge from whom he hath received them, <HI>Reus est legis plagiariae,</HI> is guilty of literary filch∣ing or robbing the treasury of the Muses. For as <HI>Pliny, Ingenui pu∣doris est fateri per quos profecerimus, &amp; haec quasi merces Authori pensitan∣da est, ne fures esse videamur.</HI> It is the part of ingenuous modesty to professe by whom we profit; and this is a guerdon by all right to be rendered to the Author, lest wee may seem to be pilferers.</P>
<P>Ingenuous and industrious Rea∣der, for to such I communicate my Genius who are embellished with the ornaments of Indifference and Diligence; For he that is void of the first, will be obnoxious to pre∣judice, which will cast an imposto∣rious mist before his eyes, and de∣lude
<PB REF="7"/> the minds of the otherwise ju∣dicious, that they cannot appre∣hend and discern things as they are in their very nature, but according to their forestalled conceits; For the will anticipated with prejudice will hurry away the understanding, whereas the understanding should direct and guide the will. A pre∣posterous course in these rash and heady times, which have need of a sound and solid observer; Men for the most part being carried a∣way with the violent stream of their affections, preferring incertain hopes, &amp; blazing shews, before setled certainties and substantial truths.</P>
<P>The second Vertue required in a a Reader, is Diligence;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It was</HI> Sci∣pio<HI>'s say∣ing,</HI> Nou amo nimi∣um diligen∣tes.</NOTE> and in this case <HI>nimia diligentia</HI> will not be dis∣pleasing to <HI>Scipio</HI> himselfe, who was <HI>nunquam minus otiosus, quam cum oti∣osus;</HI> never lesse idle, but when he was at leasure. <HI>Lucian</HI> derides an illiterate and negligent Reader, cal∣ling him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB REF="8"/> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: a buyer of many Books, and yet meanly learned, stuffing his stu∣dy with literary housholdstuff, but not with the laborious Student, or stirring Housewife, being diligent to peruse them, or industrious to apprehend them, but percursorious∣ly to run them over without obser∣vance or rumination, which causeth him often to stumble at the craggy and crabbed passages of truth, and fall into mischievous mistakes.</P>
<P>Howsoever, let the Reader be never so supine or partial, and his affections never so far esloined from the apprehension of the truth; yet as at a various Feast may he light on some Cates which may satisfie and please his palat; &amp; with <HI>Pliny,</HI> a studi∣ous Surveyor of all sorts of Books, profess that he never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead any Book <HI>quod non ex aliqua parte prodesset,</HI> that did not in some part profit him; and with <HI>Virgil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>And though many by nature seem to be of a servile disposition: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pol. c.</HI> 3.</NOTE> as the Philosopher, whose condi∣tions are best to be commanded.

The minde of man is in∣expugnably propense to rule: And <HI>Quin∣tilian, Habet enim mens nostra sublime quid &amp; erectum, &amp; impatiens superioris;</HI> For our minde hath a certain sublime and stout conceit, and is impatient of a Superiour. Whence ariseth, as <HI>Xenophon</HI> truly, the great difficulty to exercise command over men; for there is no living creature so seditious against his Pastor, that he wil not spare him if he deny him necessaries, man onely excepted, who is alwayes dis∣pleased with those that seek to have do∣minion over him, and oppresse him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patrc. ide mo. &amp; A∣rist.

<P>Hence is it obvious and clear, that all men are more propense to rule then to serve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholos.</NOTE> which is <HI>ultimus vilitatis humanae gradus,</HI> the very depth of humane base∣nesse, the vigour of nature breathing in them.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Servire cuiquam vile, dominemur magis.</HI></L>
<L>To serve is base, let us rather rule.</L></Q>
<P>And though it be alledged that some men are born to rule, and others to obey; and that <HI>Jason</HI> did thirst after a Throne, and <HI>Themistocles</HI> said that he knew not how to obey:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polit.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> The Philosopher gives the answer, that they had not learned to live a private life, being constantly employed in publick commands; which proceeded from education, not nature: Yet have there many of an obscure birth, and ser∣vile education, by the vigorous power of nature ascended to that supreme Celsi∣tude. <HI>Romulus,</HI> a sacrilegious Bastard, and educated by Shepherds; and <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> a Merchants bond-man, were the Raisers and Founders of two matchlesse Monarchies: <HI>Gordius</HI> from his Cart, and <HI>Camillus</HI> from his plow, were advanced

<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> That the Law of Armes, is above all Laws.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SVbjection is neither natural nor volun∣tary, neither will any one submit himself freely to the collar of dominion, <HI>ut canis ad vincula,</HI> but is gained by the prowesse of the Conqueror; for every one in the state of nature, hath a right to do∣minion, and conquest onely puts him in possession: and it is averse from rea∣son, that men should expose their natural liberty to imperious subjection, unless incited by fear, or constrained by force;
<PB N="42" REF="32"/> as <HI>Judicious Patricius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Mon. &amp; Aristo. f. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE> <HI>nullagens sine metu sese supremo magistratui subjecit;</HI> the horse in <HI>Aesops</HI> fables, accustomed freely before to wander up and down, would not have submitted himself to the bridle of the Ri∣der, but for fear of the Bull, his enemy, by which means the Rider obtained the do∣minion of them both, &amp; had <HI>vitae &amp; necis potestatem</HI> over them both; and it is con∣trary to the Law of nature, for any one to expose his life to anothers censure; for if no man hath power to take away his own life without the guilt of being a murtherer, how can any one conferre such a power as he hath not himself, upon any one, without being accessary to his own death, which is the most unnaturall murther?</P>
<P>Dominion then was first atchieved by valour, and Empires purchased by arms; their creation was by force; though after∣wards, some by succession, and others by election,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Syntag. juris univ. l. <HI>18</HI> c. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> were made Kings; as <HI>Tholosanus, primus vi constituit imperium, alii partim suc∣cessione, alii electione facti reges,</HI> which af∣terwards was not perpetual, but some∣times changed, by interposition of arms, which as in many Nations, so in this is most apparent; that Dominion having been by the arms of the <HI>Romans, Saxons,
<PB N="43" REF="32"/> Danes, Normans,</HI> and other particular for∣ces, often altered: and whereas many supposing the golden age, in which men at the first should live peaceably, and by election advance those to the supream dignity, who by their prudence drew bar∣barous and wandering people into socie∣ties and Cities, and instructed them in commodious arts, or conferred other be∣nefits on them, as <HI>Saturn, Jupiter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De repub. l. <HI>2.</HI> c. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bac∣chus,</HI> and <HI>Ceros;</HI> which as <HI>Bodin</HI> truly, <HI>in Jubilis poetarum, quam reipsa est illustrius,</HI> which is more illustrious by poetical fig∣ments, than reall truths.</P>
<P>Neither were those times according to their fictions, free from discords and di∣gladiations; for <HI>Jupiter</HI> by force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bod. meth. hist. c. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> depri∣ved his father of his Scepter, and was made famous for his parricides, libidi∣nous escapes, and notorious incests: his brethren also by force attempted to break the frames of heaven, and hale him from his thundering throne; and <HI>Bacchus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patric. l.</NOTE> <HI>Joves</HI> spurious impe, is affirmed to have first by force invaded and conquered the <HI>East In∣dies.</HI> This was the impious and furious product of that golden and <HI>Halcyon age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> and whereas divers otherwise exquisi∣tively learned, following the tract of <HI>Herodotus</HI> (as <HI>Justine, Cicero,</HI> and others)
<PB N="44" REF="33"/> (who though for antiquity is stiled by <HI>Ci∣cero,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alber. Gent. de armis Rom. f. <HI>54.</HI> Bodin.

Bodin. Thucid. lib. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> for as <HI>Thucydides,</HI> the truest father of Hystorie relates, that a little before his time, there was so much barbarousness, and savageness in <HI>Greece,</HI> that by Sea and Land they openly exercised theft and robbery: and <HI>Tully</HI> himself averreth, <HI>Ita rerum naturam tulisse, ut quodam tempore, homines per agros ac dispersi vagarentur, tantum{que} haber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, quantum manu ac viri∣bus per caedem &amp; vulnera accipere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orat. pro.

<PB N="45" REF="33"/> the fields, and had onely so much as they could snatch, and keep; which also in <HI>Caesars</HI> time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caesars, com.</NOTE> was the condition of the <HI>Germans,</HI> who held Larceny no infamy, but used it as an exercise for their youth, to keep them from idleness; from which I conceive <HI>Mr. Hobs</HI> might collect, that the right of nature, is a condition of warre, of every one, against every one, and right of every man to every thing, even to anothers body; but if there ever were any such plain and quiet times, as is conceived, yet were they proper onely to the first families, and of no long con∣tinuance; which is evident by the Historie of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> and the murthering mind of <HI>Lamech:</HI> The voice of God also then testifying, that the imagination of the thoughts of mans heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Genes.</HI> 6.5.</NOTE> was onely evill continually.</P>
<P>So as it is above belief, to conceive, that by the unanimous consent of such discrepant and disordered persons, a Prince or a Supream Soveraign should be quietly elected; or otherwise, that such rude and barbarous people, should be re∣duced to a civil Government, unless by force &amp; power of a victor, which was first attempted and atchieved by <HI>Nimrod;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulus, chrys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stom.

<P>And whereas, a tyrant is described by some, to be one who rules contrary to the will of the people; by that reason there should be no <HI>Kings</HI> at all: for it is

And <HI>Augustus</HI> in the beginning of the Empire, premonished by the slaughter of <HI>Caesar,</HI> armed with a coat of mail, guirded with a sword, and guarded with military forces, repaired to the Senate, besides the Praetorian co∣horts which were continually in a readi∣nesse to prevent seditions; which provi∣dent postures the succeeding Emperours
<PB N="63" REF="42"/> observed; the which also at this present is practised by most Princes; And in <HI>En∣gland</HI> was first instituted by <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣venth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon Hist.

<P>And therefore was it justly accounted a State solecisme in <HI>Caesar,</HI> though other∣wise in Military Discipline an exquisite Grammarian; who, notwithstanding he continued his perpetual Dictatorship, dismissed the Praetorian cohorts, and carelesse and fearlesse of any perill, presented himselfe naked and open to the sword of his Enemies. In which State-Criticisme, <HI>Alexander,</HI> though an expert and skilful General, was fondly overseen; who notwithstanding he had divested <HI>Antipater</HI> of the Praefecture of <HI>Macedonia, Thessalia,</HI> and <HI>Thracia,</HI> yet
<PB N="64" REF="43"/> did he appoint <HI>Philippus</HI> and <HI>Jolas</HI> his sons to be his cup-bearers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Curt. l. <HI>10.</HI> Praegusta∣tores.</NOTE> and <HI>foretasters,</HI> a place of eminent trust, and imminent pe∣rill, whom <HI>Antipater</HI> suborned to take away his life by poyson.</P>
<P>Neitheir is this State-policy a tyran∣nical device, as some detractors from ma∣jesty affirm; for by the Iudgement of <HI>A∣ristotle</HI> a perstringer of tyrants, a guard is as well basilicall as tyrannicall; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, such a guard is royal, and not tyrannical; and he putteth this difference between them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar. l. <HI>3</HI> po. c. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> that the one is guarded by forreiners and strangers, and the other by natives and Citizens; wherein <HI>Alexander</HI> also forget∣ing his Masters precepts, drew upon him∣self the suspicion of tyrannie, in com∣mitting the custody of his person to the <HI>Persians,</HI> which the <HI>Macedonians</HI> could not endure: <HI>Jactantes,</HI> as <HI>Justine, hostes suos in officium suum à rege subactos,</HI> that he had substituted their enemies in their places; with which exorbitancy the late King of <HI>England</HI> was charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declar. of Parl. <HI>May</HI> 22, 1644.</NOTE> for ha∣ving a design to bring in <HI>Germane</HI> horse, as a presumption of tyranny.

<PB N="65" REF="43"/> Princely honour, and publick utility; that the one fortifieth himself to the de∣struction of the people, and the other to defend his person against conspiracies, and to protect the people from injuries.</P>
<P>Armes are also necessary for the pro∣tection of the Law, which as the Philoso∣pher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. <HI>1.</HI> Rhet.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Government of one was the first Government on earth by man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barc. cont. Monarch. ib. Chrysost.</NOTE> as it is the Government in heaven and earth by God; for God created <HI>Adam</HI> alone, out of whom all Nations should arise, and made not woman of the earth, but of man, that there should be one head and father of man-kind: so as <HI>Adam,</HI> the father of all men, had a Monarchical pow∣er over them by a general ordinance, set∣led by God in him; and therefore as <HI>Chry∣sostom, Monarchy is more excellent than other formes, because first ordained by God: Adam</HI> then was the first Monarch and King of his family, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as <HI>Homer</HI> said of <HI>Telemachus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer O∣dyss. α.</NOTE> which Government con∣tinued in families, untill the reign of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> who first changed the paternall Monarchy into National; Though by

<P>And that Monarchy was the first Go∣vernment, appeareth also by the Testi∣mony of other approved authors: <HI>Princi∣pio rerum, gentium, nationumque imperium penes reges erat,</HI> saith <HI>Iustine,</HI> and <HI>Salust,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Justin l. <HI>1.</HI> Catal.</NOTE> <HI>lu teuris nomen imperii primum fuit:</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: The Government of all Countries, Ci∣ties, and Nations, first resided in Kings, and therefore is it feigned saith he, that all the Gods were ruled by one King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pol. l. <HI>1.</HI> c. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> which continued as a custome among all Nations, and therefore doth <HI>Aristotle</HI> adde, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as the Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> al∣so now do.

<P>Which Government of one, proceedeth from a natural inclination man hath thereunto, or as if the soul of man is a par∣cell of the divine essence, <HI>&amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti Deus in humano corpore habitans,</HI> so is there an in∣nate propensity in man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca.</NOTE> to applicate him∣self to that divine form of Government, to which all Nations, though rude, and barbarous, are and have been by it in∣cited; which moved the Israelites to desire such a King as the Nations then had: and if we survey the present State of <HI>Europe,</HI> we shall finde the Emperors from <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> the <HI>Hungarians</HI> from <HI>Aitila, Danes</HI> from <HI>Danus,</HI> the <HI>Suevians</HI> from <HI>Mugosa,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> from <HI>Fregusius,</HI> and the <HI>Brittans</HI> from <HI>Brutus,</HI> to have de∣rived

<P>And such an one is our Prince, a <HI>Caesar</HI> for valour, <HI>Augustus</HI> for fortune, and for prowesse and prudence second to neither: whose noble acts are engraven in the late perillous and epidemical wars,
<PB N="87" REF="54"/> spread over the Territories of three Na∣tions; wherein he was constantly a prin∣cipal Actor, and a perpetual Victor: <HI>Hostis ubique, &amp; semper Victor.</HI> By whose valourous vertue <HI>England</HI> was quieted, <HI>Ireland</HI> settled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Iure Reg. apud Scotes.</NOTE> and <HI>Scotland</HI> subdued and brought under subjection; which from two thousand years before, as <HI>Buchanan</HI> brags, was <HI>liberum regnum ab externarum Gentium Imperio,</HI> A Kingdome free from the dominion of Forrein Nations.

<P>But after the fury of the war was al∣layed by his invincible vertue, all dis∣cords ceased, as after a tempestuous storm the winds become calm and pleasant: Though not long after many insolencies and corruptions began to reign in the Se∣nate, ayming at an arbitrary perpetui∣ty to act what it pleased, and proposing to themselves private respects before the peoples profit, which was the just cause of its dissolution.

<P>MAny arguments offer themselves in defence of Monarchy; some of which in so clear a case I omit, lest I might seem <HI>candelam accendere in meridie;</HI> and will only touch those are most ma∣terial.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Counsell of one is more secret and effectual; for though in a multitude of Councellors there be safety, yet in the conduct of State affairs, especially in Martiall, wherein secrecy and speed are
<PB N="97" REF="59"/> essentially requisite, a number of Coun∣sellors is an incubrance. <HI>Scipio,</HI> contrary to the decree of the Senate, transported his Legions from <HI>Sicily</HI> into <HI>Africa: Et nisi plus in ea re suo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Val.

And it is a safe rule, <HI>Quod fieri debet, cum multis; quod facturus es, cum pau∣cissimis;</HI> What ought to be done, consult with many; but what you are to doe, com∣municate to few, for fear of discovery: For secrecy of councel is the safety of a State, which constantly produceth hap∣py events: As <HI>Tacitus, Primum &amp; praeci∣puum eorum quae ad faelicem exitum requirun∣tur est silere:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ann.</HI> 3.</NOTE> The first and chiefest thing of those that are required to an happy end, is silence.

<P N="2">2. The providence of one is more spee∣dy and active, which in all affaires is
<PB N="98" REF="60"/> most available; for commonly the op∣portunity of the design cannot brooke delayes.</P>
<Q><L><BIBL><HI>Ovid.</HI></BIBL> <HI>Nam mora damnosa est; nec res dubitare remittit.</HI></L>
<L>For dangerous is delay, wherein the matter cannot permit debate.</L></Q>
<P>If <HI>Themistocles</HI> and <HI>Aristides, Scipio</HI> and <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> had spent their oppor∣tunity in <HI>Ratiocinations,</HI> when the peril was eminent, the enemy had surprized them ere they had concluded what to act. <HI>Celeritas in conficiendo</HI> was one of the E∣logies of <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, which <HI>Curtius</HI> principally ascribeth to <HI>Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> to <HI>Caesar,</HI> who were so suddaine in their exploites, that <HI>Justin</HI> relates of <HI>Alexander, Ʋt quem venire non senserunnt, videre vix crederent;</HI> That whom they per∣ceived not to come, they scarcely believed to see him when he was come: And <HI>Florus</HI> of <HI>Caesar, Ante victum esse hostem quàm visum:</HI> That the enemy was over∣come before he was seen.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is more facile to finde one good man then many, and lesse subject to corrup∣tion or avarice! <HI>Rari quippe boni;</HI> Where∣as many are more impious and ravenous,
<PB N="99" REF="60"/> ever sucking and never satisfied. Though among the Romans there were severe Lawes against corruption, and bribery; yet prevailed they little with the Senate and people: for which <HI>Jugurth</HI> opbraided them with this Sarcarsme. <HI>O urbem ve∣nalem, &amp; mature perituramsi emptorem inve∣nerit;</HI> O mercenary and corrupt City, which soon would perish if it should finde a Chapman: And <HI>Marius</HI> well ex∣perienced in their conditions, brought into the Common Court bushels of Silver to purchase the peoples Suffrages; for which reason <HI>Plato</HI> calleth the popular Government of the <HI>Athenians Nundinas venales,</HI> merchandizing Marts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Synt.

<P>The <HI>Romane</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Empires permitted the exercise of divers Re∣ligions, without any pressure of con∣science, unlesse they entrenched on the principles of State or civility; and the objection answered, that a∣mong the Infidels many errors did bear with one another, and that truth cannot stand with error.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THough the <HI>Romans</HI> abounded in the multiplicity of Gods, yet permitted they all of what Nation soever to wor∣ship any of them, without restraint or pressure of mind; so as the exercise of their Religion did not entrench upon the principles of State or Civil Government.

<P>The <HI>Jewes</HI> were much favoured by <HI>Augustus,</HI> to whom he not only opened

<P>And <HI>Claudius Caesar</HI> expelled them the City for their continuall Commotions, impulsion of Christ, moved by the confi∣dence of Christs coming, from whom they expected a temporall Kingdome, as they now do.</P>
<P><HI>Tiberius</HI> also incited by such uncivill insolencies removed the Egyptians out of <HI>Rome,</HI> who were, as <HI>Adrian</HI> the Em∣perour describeth them, <HI>Genus hominum seditiotissimum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Crinit.</HI> de honest. disciplina l. <HI>12.</HI> c. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> <HI>vanissimum, &amp; injuriosis∣simum,</HI> a most seditious kind of people, most vain, and most injurious. <HI>Claudius</HI> utterly abolished the Religion of the <HI>Druides</HI> (which under <HI>Augustus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suet.</NOTE> was on∣ly interdicted the Citizens) because it was <HI>dirae immanitatis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caesar</HI> Com. de bello Gal∣lic.</NOTE> a Religion of inhu∣mane cruelty, and profaned their Altars with humane Hosts, sacrificing their li∣ving friends, and clients to the soules of the deceased: otherwise all sects, of

<P>And as the <HI>Romans,</HI> so do the <HI>Maho∣metans</HI> also condiscend to the free exercise of all Religions, and suffer all strangers, of what quality soever, to live accord∣ing to their severall Religions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clapmer</HI> de art.

<P>But here is another objection to be re∣felled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholos. Jur. univ. f. <HI>368.</HI></NOTE> which is strongly pressed, That li∣berty of Religion among infidells might with lesse perill be permitted, because their religions were erroneous, <HI>&amp; saepe errores plures se compatiuntur,</HI> and often many errors do beare one with another; but truth cannot stand with error; which experience convinceth of falshood. For among the Romans the Religion of the Jewes was permitted, which then was the true Religion: and afterward there were many Christians in <HI>Rome,</HI> of whom <HI>Paul</HI> was one, which then was the true Religion, who were so far from opposi∣tion, that they professed themselves sub∣ject to that power, and made prayers and supplications for it. So are there among the Turks many Christians who are true professors of the Gospel, and live peace∣ably without any reluctancy. And wher∣as it is averred, that truth cannot stand with error: the opposite is manifest: for among the Jewes there were divers Sects, Scribes, Pharises, Essaes, and Saddu∣ces, of which that of the Sadduces was notoriously erroneous, denying the re∣surrection
<PB N="127" REF="75"/> of the dead; yet lived they un∣der one Government, and were admitted to one Temple.</P>
<P>Among the Christians also there always were some errors. <HI>Peter</HI> denied the calling of the Gentiles, which <HI>Paul</HI> preached,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 2.11.</NOTE> yet were they both Apostles and Coadjutors in the Church: And in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> there were divers errors concern∣ing the Doctrine of Baptism,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.13.</NOTE> yet were they of one Congregation.

<PB N="129" REF="76"/> contraries, which makes them less perilous, and more peaceable; yet did the prudence of <HI>Theodosius</HI> so moderate and temper them, that they by his Edicts were induced quietly to practise their se∣verall Religions; and though all the Pro∣vinces were full of <HI>Arrians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perpiu.</NOTE> <HI>ut nullus fu∣it angulus orbis terrae, ubi non fuerint Arri∣ani de bacchati,</HI> that there was no cor∣ner of the earth where there were not raving Arrians, yet did the moderate Em∣perour abstain from coercive violence, and used only pious and gentle means to reclaim them, and especially by main∣taining the Councell of <HI>Nice,</HI> and edu∣cating and instructing his issue and Alli∣ance in the Catholique Religion, having therein good hope, that they in time might be drawn to follow his Royall and pious example; by which mild and god∣ly means he by degrees did attenuate and enervate the vigour of that numerous and furious Sect, and prevailed more with his goodness and clemency, then all the <HI>Ar∣rian</HI> Princes did with their severity or cruelty; for which <HI>Athanasius,</HI> who by them was thrust into exile, inveigheth a∣gainst them, for that they used the judicial power against those contradicted them, &amp; whom they could not perswade by argu∣ment,

<P>So <HI>Maximilian,</HI> that famous Empe∣rour
<PB N="131" REF="77"/> maintained this Doctrine, that it was an intolerable tyranny to domineer over mens consciences; and it was his advice to <HI>Henry</HI> the third, King of <HI>France,</HI> that there was no sin so great as to force mens consciences.</P>
<P>And <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth his Successor, though of a contrary opinion, yet per∣mitted he the Religion of the <HI>Augustane</HI> Confession in all Countryes, Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleyden.</NOTE> and places of the Empire, and commanded that all the associates of that Religion should peaceably use, and freely enjoy their estates, possessions, requisites and priviledges, and afterwards by advice of his <HI>Theologues</HI> imployed those of that Re∣ligion in his military affaires, whom he called his black Bands.</P>
<P>And <HI>Henry</HI> the third King of <HI>France,</HI> (after many civill wars and bloody mas∣sacres, occasioned by the enthralling of devout consciences, in which were forty thousand <HI>Hugonets</HI> miserably slaughter∣ed) observing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jeam. <HI>de</HI> Seris.</NOTE> that notwithstanding their holy leagues, and dubious battells, the <HI>Hugonets</HI> still prevailed, learned this lesson, <HI>Que le bras, &amp; le chaire ne peu∣vent forrer les ames; Que les maux spiri∣tuelles requirent remedes spirituelles, que la foy ne se plante point avec violence aux

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF we revolve the antient Monuments of the Christian Church, many exam∣ples will occur, in which, as in a glass, may clearly be seen the bloody and fatall events which usually attended the en∣forcement of religious consciences;
<PB N="137" REF="80"/> wherein the Pope, who proudly pro∣claimeth himself the Head of the Church, was the principal Author and Actor, as by the sequel may appear.</P>
<P>Kings and Emperors originally were mixt persons, as well Priests as Kings. <HI>Mos apud Judaeos fuit ut eosdem reges &amp; sacerdotes haberent:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Justia. <HI>l.</HI> 13.</NOTE> Ir was a custome a∣mong the Jews, that Kings and Priests were accounted the same: As the Poet of <HI>Annius.</HI></P>

<P>So was it in the Heroique and antient times among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. For the King was an Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>Pol. c.</HI> 3.</NOTE> and a Judge, and Lord of those things concerned Religion: And among the <HI>Latins</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Virgil <HI>Aene.</HI> in∣ferret{que} Deos La∣tio.</NOTE> King <HI>Faunus</HI> was the first instituted Religion in <HI>Italy,</HI> from whence their Temples were called <HI>Fana,</HI> which after was propagated by <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and at the last reduced into an order by <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Numa;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clap. <HI>de arc. imp.</HI> fo. 311.</NOTE> whence it was a Law among the <HI>Romans, Rex sacrorum praeses esto,</HI> Let the King be President of sacred things.</P>
<PB N="138" REF="81"/>
<P>And after the expulsion of the Kings of <HI>Rome,</HI> the same honor was resiant in the Emperour, from the time of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> who first united them, and so con∣tinued in the Christian Empire till <HI>Grati∣an,</HI> who first refused the Pontifical ha∣bit, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> unlawful to a Christian; and after <HI>Theodosius</HI> had dis∣solved the Colledge of <HI>Pontifices,</HI> and all the rest of the Priests, did the Empe∣rours notwithstanding retaine the Su∣preme power over the Christian Church; as <HI>Isaiah</HI> prophecieth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 49.23.</NOTE> <HI>Kings shall be their nursing fathers, and their Queens their nursing mothers;</HI> which <HI>Leo</HI> in his letter to <HI>Leontius</HI> intimates;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clap. <HI>de arc. imp.</HI> f. 32.</NOTE> <HI>Debes, inquit, in∣cunctanter advertere Regiam potestatem, tihi non solum ad mundi regimen, sed max∣ime ad ecclesia praesidium esse collatam.</HI> You ought, saith he, undoubtedly to observe, that the Royal Power is not only con∣ferred on you for the Government of the world, but especially for the rule and safeguard of the Church.

<PB N="139" REF="81"/> the affairs of the Church: (a relique, of which in these corrupted times still re∣mains; of which Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert, Hen. 8. fo. 291.</NOTE> maketh mention, that the Emperour must first put on the habit of a Canon of <HI>Sancta Maria Dellate</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> and after that of a Deacon, before he can be compleat∣ly invested in his Imperial Dignity) And heretofore the Popes when they were in∣stalled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pier. de Moulin. b. d. l. foy.</NOTE> paid to the Emperour, as their Soveraign Prince for their investiture twenty pounds in gold, and were by the Emperour punished, and deposed, as sub∣jects to the Emperour: As <HI>Constantius,</HI> the Son of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great chased Pope <HI>Liberius</HI> out of Rome, and substi∣tuted <HI>Faelix</HI> in his place.</P>
<P>Whence it is probable, the English Maxime, as many other, dimaned: <HI>Rex est persona mixta cum sacerdote:</HI> The King is a mixt person with a Priest, in whom is comprised both Jurisdictions, as well Ecclesiastical as civil, which caused <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> the Second to urge the said privi∣ledge of the Emperours against <HI>Anselm,</HI> desiring to be an Arch-bishop, &amp; conspi∣ring to have his Pale from the Pope, as <HI>Mathew Paris</HI> historizeth it: <HI>Rex</HI> Williel∣mus <HI>Secundus allegavit, quod nullus Archi∣episcopus, aut Episcopus Regni sui curiae Ro∣manae,

<P>Yet though the Scepters of Kings and Princes were primitively free by all right, and honored with the Supreme au∣thority in all causes whatsoever, yet hath the Pope in these later daies, blown up with boiling ambition, through the leni∣ty and piety of Princes involated on their Rights and Liberties, and not only arroga∣ted to himself Ecclesiastical Supremacy, but encroached also on the civill Jurisdi∣ction, claiming to himself the deposing of Princes, and disposing of their King∣domes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bellar.</NOTE> either <HI>in ordine ad bonum spiritu∣ale,</HI> in order or relation to a spiritual good, or else in regard of his Pastorall Authority from Christ, under which no∣tion he conceiveth all the world to be subject to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Azorius.</NOTE> <HI>In quo alii sunt actu, ut Christiani, alii potestate &amp; jure, ut Pagani;</HI> In which some are actually subject to

Thus doth he labour to mancipate the di∣vine liberty of Princes to his humane in∣ventions, and usurped Dominion, and as Christs Vicar, which title he affects, would be reputed Lord of all the world, where∣as Christs Kingdome was not of the world.</P>
<P>An insufferable tyranny imposed on this Royal freedome of Princes, which the Pope from the times of <HI>Gregory</HI> the se∣venth hath injuriously usurped, and for the space of two hundred and threescore years, nothing hath been more frequent with him, then the Excommunications of Kings and Emperours, and the Oblati∣ons and Donations of their Empires and Kingdomes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pier. <HI>de</HI> Moulin. b. d. l f 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> unless of such who have by might maintained their rights and liber∣ties against his usurpations, whence pro∣ceeded

For which detestable enormities he abo∣lished the Popes authority, demolished their superstitious Convents, and confer∣red their Revenues and substances on his deserving Subjects, and so became the terror and Quartane Fever of the Papall power; that whereas <HI>England</HI> in derisi∣on by it was reputed the Popes Ass, is now transform'd into a Lion, and is an horror to the Pope, whose magnanimous resolution, his vertuous Heir <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixt pursued, and had utterly extirpated all the Reliques of Popery, had he not been unfortunately prevented by an im∣mature fate; yet was it after prosecuted by the incomparable Spirit of a Feminine Regent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Queen</HI> Elizabeth.</NOTE> who stoutly withstood the Popes ambition, whom though he degraded and deposed, exposing her Dominions to con∣quest, yet did she subdue <HI>Sanders,</HI> and o∣thers his Substitutes in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and sink and rout the Spanish invincible <HI>Armado,</HI> destinated by him to her destruction: So as that famous Queens Motto, <HI>Honi soit qui mal y pense,</HI> Evil be to him that evil

And which also is abundantly verified in
<PB N="148" REF="86"/> the deserved confusion of the late King, which calamity originally proceeded frō the prelatical tyrannizing over mens consciences, who not onely chased some sincerely pious persons out of their native country into foraigne parts, and howl∣ing wildernesses, and imprisoned others, but also attempted to subject the rigid and resolved consciences of the Scots to the Prelaticall Discipline, which foment∣ed and bred a dangerous and tempestu∣ous storm in the North, though happily calmed by the prudence of moderate Me∣diators; yet upon the like occasion for liberty, the eradicating of Episcopacy, and abrogating the Pontificall authority, an implacable war was raised by the pro∣vocation of the Prelates; and the publike pretence, <HI>No Bishop, no King;</HI> which therefore is truly by Mr. <HI>Needham</HI> called <HI>Bellum Episcopale,</HI> as derived from the corruption and tyranny of the Bishops, and which the late King, being Episcopo∣rius, with all his might maintained; so as by degrees it infested all the parts and corners of this Commonweal.

<P>For God doth not an extraordinary act without an extraordinary end. Now how the Lord hath favoured the acts of our renowned General, and worthy Prote∣ctor, none can better perceive then his e∣nemies,
<PB N="150" REF="87"/> who by their impatient zeal to introduce Popery, protect Prelacy, and to corrupt and confound the purity of Re∣ligion have setled the one, and extirpated the other: and whom in their scurrile rimes they derided with the name of a Sce∣nicall King, have been a means to raise him to this height of dignity; and may say as <HI>Iuno</HI> said of <HI>Hercules, In laudes suas mea vertit odia.</HI> Do you think that God did all these things for nothing? For whosoever shall in his heart ponder and consider the evident graces and blessings the Lord hath poured on him, cannot be∣lieve he will leave him, but compleat and accomplish this wondrous work in him. For the great works of the Lord are con∣trary to the conceits of men: and though extraordinary miracles be ceased, yet the divine power is alwayes assistant to the ordinary power of nature, by which many times are produced extraor∣dinary acts above the reach of humane apprehension; which is apparent in the various and marvellous victories obtained by him in the name of the Lord of Hosts, whose providences among us are not to be out matched by any story: And if we impartially and judiciously examine the present postures of the State, we shall
<PB N="151" REF="87"/> clearly see the Lords workmanship shi∣ning in it according to the power of nature, or rules of policy. For though the malignant and incessant enemy is sedulous in forging stratagems to its disturbance and distraction, yet is it by the divine finger so firmly founded on the faithfull and pious affections of the more potent party, that they are presaged be∣fore conceived, and prevented before perpetrated. For though there remain in it many factions, of which the Royal and Papistical party are most seditious, and both numerous; the one containing in number forty thousand fighting persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Europ. Spec.</NOTE> and the other perhaps more: yet are the first by their just censures of sequestrati∣ons discouraged, and by their late com∣positions so obliged, that they tremble to enterprise any publike act against the State, unlesse such as are fugitives, whose estates are exposed to sale, and no way considerable. As also the second is much diminished by their recantations, and ac∣ceptance of the oath of abjuration. Many, and some of the chiefest, preferring the blessings of their estates, before the cur∣ses of <HI>Rome:</HI> and both the lesse perillous, because irreconciliably divided as Oppo∣sites in Religion, which hath a potent

<PB N="153" REF="88"/> the common enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compellit in unum commune periculum etiam ini∣micissi∣mos. Ar.

<HEAD>CAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> Mans understanding is imperfect, especially in spirituall things.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> It is the cause of many sects in Phi∣losophy, and more in Theologie.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> Among Philosophers, arguments, not torments, were their moderators.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Among Christians in the primitive times, admonitions, not persecutions, were the weapons of their warfare.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> The Arrians and other Heretiques first used force to maintain their opi∣nions, and afterwards the Pope and his adherents.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe object of the mind is verity, which is properly attributed to the divine mind; as that which is credible, to the humane: For truth is the adequati∣on of the notions of the mind, with the very nature of things; and that is said to be true, when the mind representeth the expresse image of the very thing, which the wife Artifex of the Universe had with him from eternity, and therefore cannot be ignorant of any thing: But there is
<PB N="160" REF="92"/> so great obscurity in the nature of things, and in the minds of men such obliquity and variety, that oftentimes they assent to falsities and uncertainties, which they conceive to be true and firm: and there∣fore he is said to be happy and wise who can apprehend the causes of things.</P>
<P>And because sempiternall, spirituall, and matters of faith are remote from sense, therfore is the knowledge of them more uncertain and obscure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scalig.</HI> de Sub. Exer. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> and as it were <HI>umbratilis.</HI> To the intellection of which the sharpnesse of our conceit being directed, is as weak as the eye of an Owl to the beholding of the Sun, and which the naturall man receiveth or discerneth not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.14</NOTE> and are such as no natural light doth reach unto.</P>
<P>Which naturall imbecillity hath been the impulsive cause of all the Sects in Philosophie, and heresies in Divinity: And though never so strange, or absurd, yet have their authors and founders in∣vented probable arguments, or inferred sacred sentences in their defence.</P>
<P>There are several sects in Philosophy, and more in Theologie, because more re∣mote from sense: The first amounts to the number of ten, and the other to ten times more. <HI>Epiphanius</HI> writes against 80.
<PB N="161" REF="92"/> heresies in his time, and <HI>Augustine</HI> against 90. generall Councils have erred: The Council of <HI>Nice</HI> condemned Arrianisme, and the Council of <HI>Arminium</HI> confirmed it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pier. du Moulin</HI> in his preface to the Boucl. d'le Foy.</NOTE> And the day is not more contrary to the night, then the antient Councils are to the new. <HI>Et fuit hoc omnium aetatum commune malum,</HI> saith one truly: And this hath been the common calamity of all ages; heresies and schisms daily sprou∣ting up in the Church, and like <HI>Africa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perpin.</NOTE> <HI>aliquid novi semper pariens,</HI> alwayes bringing forth one new error or ano∣ther.</P>
<P>Among Philosophers, arguments were their arms, who friendly contended to find out the truth: So did the Prince of the an∣tient Philosophers deal with <HI>Socr.</HI> &amp; <HI>Pla∣to,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. 1. <HI>Ethic. c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> professing, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: Though they were both his friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Sub.</NOTE> yet he deemed it more sacred to honour the truth: and so the Prince of the modern Philosophers <HI>Scali∣ger</HI> protested, <HI>Amicus Plato, amicus Ari∣stoteles, sed magis amica veritas. Plato</HI> was his friend, <HI>Aristotle</HI> his friend, but truth his dearest friend. Such inquisitors of the truth used no torments to extort it, but arguments, <HI>non bacillinis sed Philo∣sophicis</HI> to find it, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was their victo∣ry.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="93"/>
<P>Among Christians also in the primi∣tive time, though there were sometimes divisions, questions, envy, and strife of words, yet were they through the A∣postles admonitions contained in chari∣ty: And after the Apostles age their Suc∣cessors did not use armes and violence to propagate and settle the Gospel; the weapons of their warfare were not car∣nal, but spiritual, who did not contend with Bands of Disciplin'd Souldiers, but with aid implored of God, not with armes, but with the Spirit, not by beating, but by admonishing and reproving.</P>
<P>But after the Church was corrupted, and disceded from the Apostolical Do∣ctrine, and that by divine Authority they could not maintain their novelties, arms and all instruments of cruelty were in∣vented for the establishing of their strange Doctrine, and became more bar∣barous and inhumane, then ever <HI>Nero, Domitian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. l. <HI>11.</HI> c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Decius,</HI> and <HI>Dioclesian</HI> were: As the <HI>Arrians</HI> and the <HI>Donatists</HI> under the Raign of <HI>Valens,</HI> and tyranny of the <HI>Vandals,</HI> exceeded all the Heathen Perse∣cutors in cruelty and immanity.</P>
<P>And in these last and worst daies, when∣as the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> had usurped the pre-eminency, and began to lord it over
<PB N="163" REF="93"/> other Christian Churches, imposing great∣er and heavier burthens on Christian con∣sciences; as Prayers for the Dead, Pur∣gatory, Indulgences, and other imposto∣rious trumperies: Then began the Popes tyranny imperiously to raign over Chri∣stendome, which did not only infest the priviledges of Princes, as hath been as∣serted, but afflict the purest professors of the Gospell: Then did his <HI>Phalaris</HI> Bulls thunder and roar about the Christian Horizon, fire and sword were the argu∣ments he ejaculated against devout con∣sciences: The <HI>Hussits</HI> first come upon the Stage, who submissively imploring of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperour to be admitted to receive the Sacrament under both Species,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ludov. Aurel. Ann. Ec∣cles. <HI>f. 460.</HI></NOTE> were by Pope <HI>Martin</HI> interdi∣cted, and a sacred war denounced against them, wherein <HI>Zisca</HI> their blind, yet quick-sighted Captain (who saw as much in military affairs, as <HI>Homer</HI> did in Poeti∣cal Layes, and became so terrible to the enemy, that he supposed a Drum of his skin would fright an Army) behaved himself so skilfully and stoutly, that he overthrew the Emperors Army, and forced him to vail to their conscientious demands, and not only to grant them the sacred mysteries under both kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI> 46<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>
<PB N="164" REF="94"/> but to permit them to possess those goods they had taken out of Popish Churches, until they were with the value redeemed, with many other reformed immunities.</P>
<P>Next ensued the Scene of the <HI>Luther∣ans,</HI> the <HI>Hussits</HI> Successors, who were, as one stileth them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI> f. 445.</NOTE> <HI>Lutheranorum Antesig∣nani:</HI> They likewise marched under their Sacred Banners, and were confident pro∣pugnators and defenders of the Primi∣tive purity; and in spite of the Popes thundering power, acted their parts so couragiously and piously, that they with∣drew <HI>Denmark, Swethland,</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Saxony, Lantsgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> and some other Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> from the Popes Sup emacy, whose pious president the <HI>Hugonets</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and the Protestants in <HI>England,</HI> with the reform∣ed <HI>Netherlands</HI> did follow, to the Popes perpetual detriment, and preparation to his downfal; the which he fearing, and finding upon this defeat many in all his Jurisdictions to fall from him, repaired to his Vulcanian Conclave,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Europ.

<P>The which though he intended to have propagated through all the Catholick Dominious: yet was it not onely reje∣cted by <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Europ spe. ib.</NOTE> and solely retained in <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> but also most of the Catholicks within their Pre∣cincts (who perhaps if need were, would die for Religion) abhored the very name, and mention of the Inquisition, as being the greatest slavery the world hath tasted: And which inhumane, and unnatural violence of planting and propagating of Religion was execrably detested of the vertuous Heathens, and is abominated of
<PB N="166" REF="95"/> devout Christians, as opposite to pious Principles. For if it were aproved, and grateful to God: why did he send his Son unarmed and indigent of any exter∣nal power? why did he restrain, and re∣buke <HI>Peter</HI> endevouring with his drawn Sword to defend his Master? why did he send his Disciples as Sheep among the midst of Wolves, and naked into all parts of the World, as his Father sent him? And when did it come into the minde of the Apostles to perswade, and allow of any such violence, or their Successors, in the Primitive Church to practice any such force? neither is the distinction of any force, that the Christians deposed not <HI>Nero, Dioclesian, Julian,</HI> and <HI>Valens,</HI> because they were unequal to them in Military power, otherwise it was a strange dissimulation in <HI>Paul</HI> to in∣struct the Romans to obey the power of <HI>Nero,</HI> if he lawfully having had power, might have deposed him. Prayers were their armes, and admoni∣tions their Inquisitors: The Churches Cheif Master prayed for his enemies: and <HI>Paul</HI> his Selected Apostle exhorteth us to pray for all men, which is acceptable to God our Saviour, who would have all men come to the knowledge of the truth:

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THere are Hereticks <HI>Scientes,</HI> who know themselves to be Hereticks: and who convinced by arguments as <HI>Whitaker,</HI> persist in the defence of heresie: either for some temporal commodity, or desire of vain glory: And who being carried
<PB N="168" REF="96"/> away with selfe-love, ambition, or po∣pular applause, build the City of the De∣vil upon false and new opinions: not respecting the truth but their positions, because their own inventions, whom <HI>Au∣gustine</HI> onely placeth in his Catalogue of Hereticks: Such Hereticks after the first and second admonition are to be avoided and rejected, as the Apostle prescribeth. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3 10. <HI>who offend not from ignorance and infirmity, but from voluntary malice and obstinate industry.</HI></P>
<P>From the admonishment of such a one we are to abstain, and to leave him to him∣selfe as one condemned by himselfe, as the Apostle speaketh, and <HI>Turtullian</HI> in∣terpreteth, <HI>Elegit sibi in quo damnetur,</HI> He hath chosen to himselfe his own damna∣tion.</P>
<P>Excommunication is a separation from the Communion and Congregation of the Church:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C.</HI> 8.</NOTE> and of it is understoood that of <HI>Matthew, If he shall not hear the Church, let him be as an Heathen and a Pub∣lican;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI></NOTE> whose body as the Apostle speak∣eth, <HI>is delivered to Satan:</HI> That is, put out of the Church, out of which Satan is Lord and Master; as among the Jewes greivous offenders <HI>aposynagogi fiant,</HI> were cast out of the Church, which was to shun
<PB N="169" REF="96"/> their Communion, as the Jewes did the Samaritans.</P>
<P>Neither doth <HI>Anathema</HI> the greater and more greivous Excommunication, signi∣fie much more; of which in the Gospel we have no example, onely a general Precept 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. <HI>Whosoever loveth not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be an Anathema:</HI> which by the <HI>Glossary</HI> is expounded, <HI>Esse execrationem extra Communionem honorum us∣que ad adventum domini:</HI> To be a vehement spitting out from the Communion of the good, until the comming of the Lord; and it is rendered by <HI>Hesychius</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> execrable, and unsoci∣able, as one unworthy the society of good men: and according to the Greek Original, signifieth <HI>Deo dicatum,</HI> dedicated to God, and so separated from the Com∣munion of men for his impiety, that he is onely left to Gods judgement: All which onely sets forth unto us a separa∣tion from the Communion of the good, &amp; the dereliction of them so separated to the judgement of the Lord:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tac.

<PB N="170" REF="97"/> and all heretical opinions are properly of∣fences against God, and therefore to be re∣ferred to his judgement: &amp; as the Civilians in the like case, <HI>Satis deum ultorem habent,</HI> have God a sufficient revenger; and how such errors shall be punished at the day of of Judgement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotius de Jur. b. et p.</NOTE> <HI>nemo potest scire nisi Judex,</HI> saith <HI>Salvianus,</HI> no man can know but the Judge. And therefore doth Christ, <HI>Mar.</HI> 6.12. referr the judgement of such as re∣fuse his Doctrine, until the day of Judge∣ment: and whosoever, as Mr. <HI>Ashkam,</HI> shall think himselfe competent to judge of it here, is <HI>nimis Curiosus in aliena repub∣lica.</HI></P>
<P>Excommunication was rarely execu∣ted in the Primitive Church, of which we have but two examples in the Gospel: the one against the Incestuous one, whom <HI>Paul</HI> commanded to be delivered to Sa∣tan:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.</NOTE> a sin abhorred of the Heathens, and severely punished by them. The other against blasphemers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.20.</NOTE> <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Alex∣ander,</HI> whom <HI>Paul</HI> also delivered to Satan. An offence mortal under the Law, <HI>Levit.</HI> 24. and dangerous under the Gospel, if not repented of: <HI>Math.</HI> 12.31. And of all offences the highest, because it is an impiety against God himselfe, whereas other offences are transgressions against
<PB N="171" REF="97"/> the Law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholos. Synt. Jur. Ʋniv. l. <HI>33.</HI> c. <HI>12.</HI> contra ipsa deitatem impie agis.</NOTE> And this was <HI>Pauls</HI> rod of Correction which he rarely used; so rare a censure was Excommunication in the purest times: For the excesse of which St. <HI>John</HI> condemneth <HI>Diotrephes</HI> in casting his Brethren out of the Church.</P>
<P>But how Excommunication the last, and greivous punishment of the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Adue.</NOTE> as Mr. <HI>Whitgift</HI> calleth it, hath been abu∣sed under Popery and Prelacy, is notori∣ously evident: and especially by the Pope, whose continual practice was to inflict it on any one as a Delinquent, either in matters of Faith, or Manners;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pier. de Moul. Buc. de la foy. f. <HI>506.</HI></NOTE> or by it to presse men to restore things lost, and to pay their debts within a cer∣tain time: and sometimes without any cognisance of the cause. Kings and Em∣perours were most obnoxious to this cen∣sure, who being Excommunicated as the Pope pretendeth, could not without sin∣ning exercise their Iurisdiction: and what Acts and Sentences during the Ex∣communication they pronounced, were null and void; by which rule he also de∣posed them: From whose institutions the Prelates originally derive their Iu∣risdiction; and in their discipline doe not much vary, setting the Papal Altitude and Latitude aside: and therefore was
<PB N="172" REF="98"/> our Arch-Prelate stiled <HI>Alterius orbis Papa:</HI> who likewise transgressed in the excessive abuse of excommunications, as <HI>Whitgift</HI> a Patron of Praelacy acknow∣ledgeth in these words;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Ad∣monition.</NOTE> That excom∣munication, the last and greatest punish∣ment in the Church, is commonly used in many trifling matters, and therefore is commonly neglected and contemned: I pray God, saith he, restore it to its first pu∣rity: neither was by either of them the pious end of Excommunication respe∣cted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.</NOTE> which was that for shame of the se∣paration, the separated should be drawn to repentance: as the Apostle saith of the Incestuous one, <HI>That his flesh may be destroyed, and the spirit saved in the day of the Lord Jesus:</HI> and also of the blasphe∣mers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.20.</NOTE> <HI>That they may learn not to blaspheme;</HI> whereas their ultimate drift was to heap up monyes and inrich themselves by for∣mal Absolutions and pecuniary Satis∣factions, supposing gaine to be godlinesse, and through coveteousnesse by fained words to make merchandize of mens souls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.6.</NOTE> as the Apostle speaketh: For such and like abominable abuses, the Popes Excommunications are slighted, and de∣spised of most Princes, and the Papal and Prelatical Iurisdicton neglected in all
<PB N="173" REF="98"/> Reformed Churches; and in our Church utterly abolished: as it was resolved in the late Parliament by the declaration of the Lords and Commons in answer to the Scotch papers, the fourth of <HI>March</HI> 1647.

<P>Yet are we not to bear with the loose∣nesse of such ungodly men, as the Apo∣stle calls them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jud. <HI>v.</HI> 4.</NOTE> who turn the grace of God into lasciviousnesse, and prefer natural liberty before religious and Christian: Not unlike to the <HI>Cynique</HI> Philosophers, who supposed nothing to be obscene or dishonest, which was according to the li∣berty and course of nature; and what they were not ashamed openly to profess, they blushed not in the eyes of all men to act;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lud. Aure∣lius. Ann. Eccles. f. <HI>475.</HI></NOTE> or rather like unto the <HI>Adamites, Quibus,</HI> as <HI>Aurelius, nullum indumentum,
<PB N="177" REF="100"/> promiscua erant connubia, vagi concubitus, nulla temporis loci{que} habita ratione;</HI> who wore no apparel, used confused and pro∣miscuous marriages, &amp; common unclean∣nesse, without any respect to time or place. And such indeed are the <HI>Liber∣tine, Antinomians, Quakers</HI> and <HI>Ranters</HI> in these latter dayes, who, under the pre∣tence of piety and Christian liberty, pra∣ctise all obscenity and impiety, licenti∣ous persons, and loose in all wicked and abominable actions. Whereas such li∣berty is slavery, <HI>Nam qui facit peccatum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 8.34.</NOTE> <HI>servus est peccati,</HI> He that commits sin, is the servant of sin: And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty: And therefore such Libertines are not to be suffered, but ought to be eslaved to the sword of the Magistrate, which the late Parlament of <HI>England,</HI> in the Declarati∣on of the 27. of <HI>November</HI> 1649. doth sig∣nifie and pronounce in the sight of God and man, That by whomsoever they shal finde this liberty abused, they shall be ready to testifie their displeasure and ab∣horrencie thereof, by a strict and effectual proceeding against such offenders: And accordingly, by the Act of <HI>August</HI> 1650. hath it provided for the removal and pu∣nishment of such transgressors, whose
<PB N="178" REF="101"/> blasphemies are in the said Act recited and severely censured. In pursuance whereof, by the Government of the Com∣monwealth of <HI>England</HI> Art. 37. is liberty denied to those who abuse it, to the civil injury of others, and the actual distur∣bance of the publique peace on their parts, or to such as under the profession of Christ hold forth the practise of Licenti∣ousnesse.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CAP. IX.</HI> The Epilogue, or Conclusion of all.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing then it is clear, that through the weaknesse of our understanding in natural as well as spiritual things, which are onely preceptible by the light of the spirit, many errors and heresies of neces∣sity must arise, and that the envious man continually soweth tares among the wheat, and tyrannical impositions on mens consciencs have augmented and in∣creased the Schismes of the Church, and have been the fomenters of bloody broils, to the detriment of the authors; and that Christ and his Apostles in all
<PB N="179" REF="101"/> their teachings and practise abstained from external violence, in gentlenesse and meeknesse instructing all men, we ought to refrain from all unnatural and unchristian force, and not to constraine the will of man to beleive, or seeme to professe that which he knoweth not, but to put on the meeknesse and gentlenesse of Christ, and above all things Charity, which is the bond of Christian perfecti∣on, and to become all to all men, to save some, and to pleasure our neighbour for his good to edification. Which charita∣ble course (the God of love and charity be blessed for it) is at this present practi∣sed in the purest Christian Churches. As first in <HI>Germany,</HI> in which, though wives in doctrine dissent from their husbands, and parents and children follow divers Sects, and brothers and sisters sometimes in one and the same family nou∣rish discrepant opinions, touching many heads of Divinity; yet as <HI>Scorbonerius,</HI> one of that Nation writeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pol. l. <HI>3.</HI> c. <HI>11</HI></NOTE> <HI>In politicis &amp; domesticis rebus concordes vivere compre∣henduntur,</HI> in politique and domestique affaires are observed to live peaceably, otherwise hoping that the unbelieving man may sanctifie and save the unbelee∣ving woman, and beleeving brothers and
<PB N="180" REF="102"/> sisters the unbeleevers. Then in <HI>France</HI> are the <HI>Hugonets,</HI> and the Catholiques as they distinguish them, by the prudency of their Princes reduced into a charitable and peaceable condition; who wisely by an Edict have provided that all illiberal revilings and unworthy contumelies on either part should be removed, and not any thing said or acted which might tend to uncivil commotions, but that it should be lawfull for every one to follow the judgment of his own minde; whereupon a blessed &amp; placid calm ensued: And as one, <HI>Coalescunt mutuâ concordiâ mentes omnium,</HI> The mindes of all by mutual concord grow together:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perpinian.</NOTE> And so rare is their mo∣deracy and temperate behaviour, that notwithstanding the provoking comme∣morations of the late intestine wars, they have mutual commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moderator. f. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE> and frequently dispute together, not onely the Clergy, but the Tradesmen one with another, and defend every one his opinion civilly and peaceably, without any convitious di∣stemper, in a friendlinesse, and mutual compassionate part, and perfect charity, each hoping and praying for the others conversion.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Netherlands</HI> also, though there be within a small compasse professed di∣vers
<PB N="181" REF="102"/> Religions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Europae specu. f. <HI>176.</HI></NOTE> and that the Papacy there hath two thirds in it; yet doth every one peaceably professe the liberty of his mind without any molestation and contradicti∣on, which have alwayes been a Recepta∣cle and saving Sanctuary for such afflict∣ed consciences.</P>
<P>The <HI>Helveteans</HI> likewise, though of different judgment in matters of Religi∣on, yet are they united by concord and charity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel He∣remita de rep. Helv.</NOTE> and in civil and publique Af∣faires which concerne the safety of the Country, <HI>Ne quic quam nisi in commune con∣sultant,</HI> They act nothing but by consul∣tation in common. And also in <HI>Transil∣vania, Valachia,</HI> and the remaines of <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> in which many Religi∣ous doe abound, notwithstanding their conscientious diversities, do they embrace each other in the drmes of civility and charity. And whensoever wars and mas∣sacres have been made for the cause of Religion, enquire from whence they have proceeded? whether from the Roman, or from the Reformed Churches; and we shall understand that the Romanists first provoked them, and they onely took up armes in their own defence. Which in it it selfe is apparent, if we call to minde the Sacred Wars, as they call them, but
<PB N="182" REF="103"/> indeed accursed, both in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> which were principally, as hath been before intimated, indicted by the Pope and his Confederates, or Holy Leagues, as they stile them. And whence dimaned that abominable and execrable massacre at <HI>Paris,</HI> wherein forty thousand persons were inhumanely butchered, which is notorious and odious to all Christendome, whose children are often frighted with the memory of it. Neither is the horrible and lamentable slaughter to be superseded in silence, which lately was perpetrated by Papal Forces on the innocent and innoxious Protestants in <HI>Savoy,</HI> where they who by flight escaped their fury, were driven from their com∣fortable habitations, and so eagerly pro∣secuted, that they were compelled to hide themselves in Caves, or wander on the Mountaines, and either perish for want of food, or common with the Beasts. Who now begin to revive the bloody differences have a long time been buried in the bowels of Charity, and to provoke the consciencious Christians to defensive armes? <HI>Woe be to them from whom the offence commeth,</HI> saith our Savi∣our, who without doubt will raise the spirits of pious Princes, as he alwayes
<PB N="183" REF="103"/> hath, to protect his own cause, and to vindicate the persecutions of his Church. And in this doth their Religion shew it selfe from whence it commeth; not from God, <HI>qui odit crudelitatem,</HI> who hateth cruelty, and abhorreth all humane hosts, and bloody devotions: The sacrifice of God is a spiritual sacrifice, and the wea∣pons of his warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, yet mighty through God for the pulling down of strong holds, and casting down of imaginations, and brin∣ging into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ: Prayers, perswasions &amp; tears are the arms of the Church, by which kinde of weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perjin. O∣rat. f. <HI>528.</HI></NOTE> as an ingenious Jesuit confesseth, <HI>Terrarum orbis sub Christi ditionem potestatem{que} subjectus erat,</HI> the whole earth was subjected under the power and dominion of Christ. And which kinde of Christian combate the Parliament in answer to the Scotch pa∣pers <HI>March</HI> 13. 1647. preferreth, decla∣ring it to be better to leave God to deale against many Errors, then to use his au∣thority for the suppressing of one truth, the weapons of fasting and prayer being both more Christian and available in such cases. Tyrannical Force, and infernal Inquisitors, being the
<PB N="184" REF="104"/> Devils Instruments to support Error, and too weak and feeble to withstand spiritu∣al armes, and the power of Christ. The counsel of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> therefore which he gave unto the <HI>Jewes,</HI> and persecuters of the Apostles, in this case is worthy the observation and practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 5.38.</NOTE> to abstain from force, and let them alone; <HI>For if this Counsel,</HI> saith he, <HI>or work be not of God, it will come to nought; and if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found to fight against God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ovid.</NOTE> <HI>Exitus acta probat,</HI> saith the Poet; <HI>neque ulla res quale quidque sit magis ostendit, quam quae quidque sequa∣tur;</HI> The end approveth the acts; nei∣ther doth any thing more demonstrate the quality and quiddity of the thing then the consequence of that thing.</P>

<PB N="185" REF="104"/> to blesse it, Heaven and Earth and all the Creatures of God to witnesse it, that maugre the malice of all enemies, and craft of all inventions, it must needs in the end prevaile, and have the Victory: So as it may well be hoped, That Uni∣versal Liberty thus moderated, in pro∣cesse of time, the foundation of Heresie may be rooted out, and whatsoever is contrary to sound Doctrine, by drawing their followers and adherents by gentle instructions, and powerful perswasions; and Truth being left to the decision of the Conscience, and operation of the spirit which is one, may in the end prove Uni∣versally Victorious, and Christendome reduced to Unity, and Truth; The con∣trary effects whereof continually happen by the Tyranous impositions of opinions on mens Consciences: from whence in∣testine and bloody Wars arise, as have been clearly, and fully demonstrated.</P>
