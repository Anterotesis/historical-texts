<HEAD>To the English Nation, and to every Individual Person
within these Brittish Isles, Geo. Wither, wishes that
Grace, Peace, and Love in CHRIST JESUS,
which by an unfeigned Humiliation, may reconcile us
all to GOD; Vnite us by an indissolvable Band of
Charity, to each other; and in a Christian Amity,
withall Nations through the world.</HEAD>
<L>MY <HI>Sighs</HI> concern you all, throughout this <HI>Nati∣on</HI></L>
<L>Who are this day, in true <HI>Humiliation</HI></L>
<L>To seek the face of GOD; For, we make <HI>One</HI></L>
<L>Of those <HI>two Pitchers</HI> whom I do bemone:</L>
<L>And, unto whom (then fearing much their breaking,</L>
<L>When first I saw <HI>War preparations</HI> making)</L>
<L>I sent a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> both with an Intent</L>
<L>And hope, that which was feared, to prevent;</L>
<L>Which, failing my good purpose to produce,</L>
<L>I send this now, to mediate a Truce;</L>
<L>For, who can tell, but that my words may have</L>
<L>Such <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssue now, as heretofore GOD gave</L>
<L>Unto a <HI>private-womans</HI> when she spoke</L>
<L>For <HI>Abel,</HI> what effect in season took?</L>
<L>So may it prosper as I am sincere</L>
<L>In that, Which I have <HI>Superscribed</HI> here;</L>
<L>And, let my Foes on earth, be still as many</L>
<L>As there are men, if I wish ill to any;</L>
<L>Or, am not pleasd that all should live and die</L>
<L>As happy, both in Life and Death as I</L>
<L>Who shall not, by <HI>a final Wilfulness,</HI></L>
<L>Deprive themselves of what they might possess;</L>
<L>And slander GOD, as <HI>cause Original</HI></L>
<L>Of that, which doth amiss to them befal.</L>
<L>For, though, not few, my Adversaries be</L>
<L>Or such, as, yet, bear no good will to me,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
I, ev'n for that cause, am in love, their debter;</L>
<L>For, him, who loves his Foes, GOD, loves the better:</L>
<L>Yea, having partly been, in my distress</L>
<L>Relievd by some few who, do naytheless</L>
<L>Seem still my Enemies; it, makes me more,</L>
<L>Love GOD, and all <HI>Mankinde,</HI> then heretofore.</L>
<L>A time is come, in which, it is our turn</L>
<L>Both <HI>altogether,</HI> and <HI>apart to mourn:</HI></L>
<L>Those <HI>General Calamities</HI> befal</L>
<L>Which, for a <HI>general Repentance</HI> call,</L>
<L>And, for <HI>particular Humiliation,</HI></L>
<L>In order to a <HI>publick Reformation,</HI></L>
<L>From which, at present, are excepted none;</L>
<L>No, not the King, who sitteth on the Throne:</L>
<L>For, that which is in <HI>Cottages</HI> begun</L>
<L>Will seize the <HI>Pallace,</HI> ere the <HI>Round</HI> is run,</L>
<L>If GOD in mercy, answer not our hope,</L>
<L>And, to our sins and fears, vouchsafe a Stop.</L>
<L>To that end, though this be not what I would</L>
<L>Or, should contribute, it is what I could</L>
<L>And, may now, be as usefully exprest,</L>
<L>As what more artificially is drest:</L>
<L>Yea, (though it be, that onely) in effect,</L>
<L>Which I have ost preferd without respect,</L>
<L>This, seems a very seasonable time,</L>
<L>To greet you, with a <HI>Reasonable Rime.</HI></L>
<L>Accept it therefore, and be not offended</L>
<L>With what is conscientiously intended.</L>
<L>GOD, who from us doth <HI>Trifles</HI> oft receive,</L>
<L>Requires of none, more then he hath to give;</L>
<L>And, if you shall accept what's in my powr</L>
<L>He, will of that accept, which is in your;</L>
<L>For, all that is contributed, by this,</L>
<L>Worth your acceptance, is not <HI>mine,</HI> but his.</L>

<L>'Such is GODS gratiousness, that, wheresoever</L>
<L>'He finds a <HI>Willingness</HI> joynd with <HI>endeavour</HI></L>
<L>To please or to appease him, though bat small,</L>
<L>(And in it self worth no respect at all)</L>
<L>He doth accept it: But, it is not so</L>
<L>With <HI>men,</HI> what er'e we <HI>mean,</HI> or <HI>say,</HI> or do.</L>
<L>For, most so pettish are; that ev'n with that</L>
<L>Which to their own <HI>well-being</HI> doth relate,</L>
<L>They quarrel; and as much offended are</L>
<L>With what, unto their own particular</L>
<L>Hath no relation, as to any thing</L>
<L>Which may to them a disadvantage bring.</L>
<L>Yea, so inclind are, to be discontent</L>
<L>With <HI>Actions,</HI> and with <HI>words indifferent,</HI></L>
<L>That how to fit all humors no man knows</L>
<L>What ere he writes, be it in <HI>Verse</HI> or <HI>Prose.</HI></L>
<L>Some, are best pleasd with <HI>this,</HI> and some with <HI>that,</HI></L>
<L>With nothing some; or, with <HI>we know not what,</HI></L>
<L>Except with that, (and in their own mode drest)</L>
<L>Whereby their <HI>Single Fancies</HI> are exprest.</L>
<L>If, I may freely, <HI>Truth</HI> declare in either,</L>
<L>To me, it is indifferent in whether:</L>
<L><HI>Verse</HI> cannot be so justly termd unholy</L>
<L>As they, who think so, may be chargd with folly.</L>
<L>The Libertie, I therefore, at this time,</L>
<L>Resume, to vent my mind in <HI>Verse</HI> and <HI>Rime</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
As heretofore without an affectation</L>
<L>Of what, is this day, with most men in fashion;</L>
<L>And, what I purpose to contribute now,</L>
<L>Shall be such <HI>private Sighings</HI> as I owe</L>
<L>To <HI>Publick sorrowings;</HI> not such, as may,</L>
<L>Without true sense thereof, be puft away.</L>
<L>I offer not, now <HI>Cures</HI> are to be done,</L>
<L>That, which will prove no better then <HI>Herb-John</HI></L>
<L>Or <HI>Chipps</HI> in broth; nor, when provide I should</L>
<L>Apparel to preserve my Friend from cold,</L>
<L>Bring them such thin sleight Garments, as are neither</L>
<L>Good <HI>Silk</HI> or <HI>Cloth,</HI> but <HI>Bawbles</HI> patcht together,</L>
<L>Lace, Points and Ribbands: Nor, to feed them, set</L>
<L>A platter full of <HI>Sawces</HI> without <HI>meat,</HI></L>
<L>Or, with so little, and so trimd about</L>
<L>With <HI>Kickshawes,</HI> that they cannot pick it out:</L>
<L>Nor give the <HI>Sick,</HI> when they for health endeavor,</L>
<L>Such <HI>Trash,</HI> as may beget a <HI>mortal Feaver;</HI></L>
<L>Nor <HI>Healing Plasters,</HI> when I do perceive</L>
<L>The <HI>Patient</HI> rather needs a <HI>Corrosive:</HI></L>
<L>Nor, if there ought improper to that end,</L>
<L>For which, <HI>Humiliations</HI> we pretend</L>
<L>In that, which I in words have added here:</L>
<L>Either peruse it therefore, or, give ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BEfore a <HI>Storm</HI> is actually begun,</L>
<L>Or, Symptoms of it, in the Skies appear;</L>
<L>Both Birds and Beasts, for shelter fly and run,</L>
<L>To scape the Dangers, then approaching near.</L>
<L>To what these are by <HI>Sense</HI> inclind, in season,</L>
<L>Men are assisted (for their preservations)</L>
<L>By Strong Impulses, both of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI></L>
<L>Till they neglect, or sleight those Inclinations.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
And to the <HI>Publick safety,</HI> every one</L>
<L>Owes what may possibly by him be done:</L>
<L>For, there's a <HI>Portion</HI> due from him that's poor,</L>
<L>Though from the Rich, there is expected more.</L>
<L>2. I had some education in the, <HI>Schools,</HI></L>
<L>But my best <HI>Teachings,</HI> came another way,</L>
<L>And, neither to the <HI>wisest,</HI> or <HI>meer Fools,</HI></L>
<L>Is that intended which I have to say.</L>
<L>My <HI>Muse</HI> is to a midling-temper fitted,</L>
<L>What suits with their capacities to write</L>
<L>Who, (not much under or much over witted)</L>
<L>More in the <HI>Matter,</HI> then the <HI>Words</HI> delight.</L>
<L>By that means, when with <HI>Trifles</HI> I begin,</L>
<L>Things useful, are oft, thereby Skrewed in,</L>
<L>Which peradventure, had not else been sought,</L>
<L>Where, they appeard more likely to be taught:</L>
<L>What I but to one end, at first intended,</L>
<L>Occasions many <HI>Cautions,</HI> ere 'tis ended.</L>
<L>So, sometimes, twenty businesses are done,</L>
<L>By him, who went from home, to do but one.</L>
<L>3. Sometimes too, by what in this mode is hinted,</L>
<L>(On sleight occasions in a Vulgar Strain)</L>
<L>Such Notions have been in the heart imprinted</L>
<L>As were more plausibly exprest in vain:</L>
<L>Yea, otherwhile, a few <HI>plain words,</HI> in season,</L>
<L>Experimentally in <HI>private</HI> spoke,</L>
<L>More operate with <HI>Sanctified Reason,</HI></L>
<L>(And of what they import, more heed is took)</L>
<L>Then is (although more gloriously arayd)</L>
<L>Of what's but <HI>formally,</HI> in <HI>publick</HI> said.</L>
<L>Now therefore, I contribue thus, alone,</L>
<L>To what was this day, publickly begun.</L>
<L>But, stay! what Pannick fear hath seizd this <HI>Nation</HI></L>
<L>That, they who Triumphd but one day ago,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Assume the Postures of <HI>Humiliation,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Fast</HI> and <HI>Pray,</HI> at least, pretend thereto?</L>
<L>Their Jollitie is at a suddain pause,</L>
<L>And to the Temples, they begin to flock;</L>
<L>God make th' effect, as real as the cause,</L>
<L>That, him with formal showes we do not mock,</L>
<L>Lest Plagues increase, and when of what is better,</L>
<L>We are in hope, our fears grow dayly greater:</L>
<L>For, till our sins are heartily repented,</L>
<L>By Fasts and Prayers, <HI>Plagues</HI> are not prevented.</L>
<L>5. Most, dedicated this moneths first <HI>Aurora</HI></L>
<L>To their own fleshly Lusts; and spent the day</L>
<L>In sacrificing to the Strumpet <HI>Flora,</HI></L>
<L>Which was by some employd another way,</L>
<L>Perhaps though not <HI>Prophane,</HI> more <HI>superstitious</HI></L>
<L>Then holy: for, all is not sanctifide</L>
<L>That is not vulgarly reputed vitious;</L>
<L>Nor all unholy, which will not abide</L>
<L>A <HI>Sanctuary-Test:</HI> But, somwhat hath</L>
<L>Doubtless, been acted which provokes Gods wrath</L>
<L>Against our <HI>Nation,</HI> since this Month begun,</L>
<L>That brings us on our knees, before 'tis done.</L>
<L>6. Our <HI>Safety, Peace</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> lie at stake;</L>
<L>And, we are forced such a Game to play,</L>
<L>As makes us tremble, and our hearts to ake</L>
<L>Twixt hope and fear of that which follow may:</L>
<L>Ev'n they, who lately foolishly did boast,</L>
<L>And with proud Vaunts and scorns contemn their Foes,</L>
<L>Do find, that Recknings made without their hoast,</L>
<L>Arise to more then they did presuppose.</L>
<L>Of Foes without them, their regard was small;</L>
<L>Of those within them, less, or none at all:</L>
<L>But, now, to be assaulted, they begin</L>
<L>With outward perils, and with fears within.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
7. Beyond reteating we ingaged are</L>
<L>With <HI>forraign enemies;</HI> and not quite free</L>
<L>From <HI>Factions,</HI> threatning an <HI>intestine</HI> War,</L>
<L>If our Presumings unsuccessfull be.</L>
<L>As <HI>foes</HI> do multiply, so, <HI>friends</HI> grow fewer;</L>
<L>And, in those few, there is but little trust:</L>
<L>For, none can in another be secure</L>
<L>Who, to himself is neither kind nor just.</L>
<L><HI>War</HI> is begun; the <HI>Pestilence</HI> doth spread;</L>
<L>And, though of <HI>Dearth</HI> we feel but little dread,</L>
<L>They, by whose Labours, <HI>plenty</HI> was increast,</L>
<L>Are by a wasting <HI>Poverty</HI> opprest.</L>
<L>8. The Rich are discontent, the Poor much grievd:</L>
<L>The first have small hope to be better pleasd;</L>
<L>The last as little hope to be relievd,</L>
<L>And most men are grown stupidly diseasd.</L>
<L>Men with <HI>Ill tidings</HI> in all places meet,</L>
<L>Bewailing loss of <HI>Goods,</HI> or want of <HI>Trade:</HI></L>
<L>All day they hear complainings in the street;</L>
<L>All night, they and their Families are sad.</L>
<L>Hereof, they upon others lay the blame</L>
<L>Who have been chief deservers of the same:</L>
<L>Most, apprehend a general Distress,</L>
<L>But, no man knows which way to make it less.</L>
<L>2. They, who should <HI>act,</HI> or <HI>mediate</HI> at least,</L>
<L>Some course to stop the fury of the Current,</L>
<L>Finde, it will most advance their Interest,</L>
<L>To be at this time Fishing in the <HI>Torrent.</HI></L>
<L>They, who have now most cause, least frighted be:</L>
<L>Those few alone, who with a filial fear</L>
<L>And Christian hope, Gods purposes foresee,</L>
<L>Submissive to his <HI>Dispensations</HI> are:</L>
<L>The rest are active still, in their own mode,</L>
<L>As if in their own power their safety stood;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Or, that it might be wrought, by their own hand,</L>
<L>If (as twas once said) <HI>GOD would Neuter stand.</HI></L>
<L>16. For our defence, a <HI>Naval preparation</HI></L>
<L>Is made, as strong, as ever heretofore</L>
<L>In any Age, was modeld by this Nation;</L>
<L>Yea, stronger much, though not in number more.</L>
<L>And, if they who thereof have management,</L>
<L>Shall not thereon (as if it could not fail)</L>
<L>Or, in <HI>themselves,</HI> be over-confident,</L>
<L>It may against our ablest Foes prevail:</L>
<L>But, not unless, we timely lay aside</L>
<L>Our <HI>malice,</HI> our <HI>profaness,</HI> and our <HI>pride,</HI></L>
<L>Which by the <HI>Lord of hosts,</HI> are so abhord,</L>
<L>That, they destroy more, then both <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>sword.</HI></L>
<L>11. In <HI>mournings,</HI> we so little do delight,</L>
<L>That, whatsoever sad event befals,</L>
<L>Which to <HI>humiliation</HI> doth invite,</L>
<L>It seldom supersedes our <HI>Festivals.</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Fast</HI> therefore, so near a <HI>Feast</HI> begins,</L>
<L>To moderate our <HI>Mirth,</HI> and make us minde</L>
<L>A true and speedy mourning for those sins</L>
<L>Whereto we have been, and are still inclinde.</L>
<L>A change of <HI>Feasts</HI> to <HI>fastings</HI> threatned was,</L>
<L>Which is within a little come to pass;</L>
<L>And, that, may peradventure be effected</L>
<L>Which we most fear, when it is least expected.</L>
<L>12. Hereof the <HI>Civil powers</HI> having sense,</L>
<L>And, fearing what might probably befal,</L>
<L>Unless, we strengthned are by <HI>Providence</HI></L>
<L>Much more, then by their <HI>moving wooden-wall;</HI></L>
<L>They lately summond us by <HI>Proclamations</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>meet,</HI> and on the last of <HI>May</HI> begin</L>
<L>In our <HI>head-Cities,</HI> such <HI>Humiliations</HI></L>
<L>As may declare a true Remorse for sin.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>
Early that <HI>morning,</HI> likewise, lest we might</L>
<L>Their <HI>summons,</HI> either then forget, or slight,</L>
<L>GOD, seconded their <HI>Act,</HI> and from our beds</L>
<L>With Peals of Thunders, raisd our drowzie heads.</L>
<L>13 If I was not deceivd, five hours together</L>
<L>That <HI>Summons</HI> lasted, (with few Intervals)</L>
<L>Made signal by Rain, Lightning, Stormy weather,</L>
<L>And Thunderbolts, which pierced through stone-wals.</L>
<L>It brake and melted Bells; consumd a Steeple;</L>
<L>Scard Fowls and Beasts, yea, and afraid did make</L>
<L>Even them, among those unrelenting People,</L>
<L>Who, heed of nought but <HI>smart</HI> and <HI>noise</HI> will take;</L>
<L>And in security again sleep on</L>
<L>Assoon as ere the <HI>pain</HI> or <HI>noise</HI> is gone.</L>
<L>Alas! what horrours will such men confound,</L>
<L>When they shall hear the <HI>seventh Trumpet</HI> sound?</L>
<L>14. I did obey this <HI>Call;</HI> and knowing too,</L>
<L>That in the <HI>common peace,</HI> mine doth consist,</L>
<L>In meekness, I prepard my heart, to do</L>
<L>What might secure the <HI>common Interest.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>best</HI> have failings, and the <HI>worst</HI> have more;</L>
<L>Though therefore they oft erre, who are in powre,</L>
<L>With their defects, we must our own deplore:</L>
<L>For oftentimes <HI>their faults</HI> take root from <HI>our.</HI></L>
<L>King <HI>Davids</HI> crime sprung from the <HI>Peoples</HI> sin;</L>
<L>For <HI>his</HI> offence, a Plague on <HI>them</HI> broke in:</L>
<L>Thus, to each other, men of each degree,</L>
<L>A mutual cause, of <HI>sins</HI> and <HI>suffrings</HI> be.</L>

<L>In us; or to advance his praise alone,</L>
<L>Thence would spring many great advantages.</L>

<L>This <HI>month</HI> last year when we did glorifie</L>

<L><PB N="36" REF="20"/>
For, whatsoever, <HI>Policy</HI> and <HI>Pride</HI></L>

<L>Our <HI>Earthen Pitchers,</HI> are so knockt together</L>
<L>That one or two more such like knocks will break them</L>

<L>Except to patch up the <HI>Designs</HI> of those</L>

<L>This would be better heeded, if it were</L>
<L>Propounded by a <HI>Private Counseller,</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Bishop</HI> or a <HI>Judge:</HI> Thus I suppose,</L>
<L>Till I remember, that the best of those</L>
<L>Have <HI>writ,</HI> and spoke in vain: yet, then, were they</L>
<L>Obligd to speak their conscience, so am I.</L>
<L>But, many, who to be my Friends would seem,</L>

<L>Perswade me, in thes: <HI>matters</HI> to be mute:</L>

<L>That, they lovd neither <HI>Truth,</HI> nor <HI>Rime,</HI> nor <HI>Reason.</HI></L>

<L>Which with infeebled and lame wings doth fly:</L>
<L>None certainly informed of what's done,</L>

<L>We hear sad <HI>News</HI> one day, as bad next morrow,</L>

<L>Where<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to GOD and <HI>Man</HI> it is a Debter.</L>

<L>If so it were (because, it might prevent</L>

<L>And thankful, for the good success we had:</L>
<L>But, nothing therein mention'd found I out,</L>
<L>Whence, I could pick forth, what to find, I sought.</L>
<L>All I could thence collect, was but thus much,</L>
<L>That, <HI>We were heaten, and did beat the Dutch,</HI></L>
<L>Till they were glad, at last, to sail away,</L>
<L>And, we as glad, they did no longer stay.</L>
<L>He, that was otherwise informd thereby</L>

<L><PB N="38" REF="21"/>
For, though it is imprudence to reveal</L>
<L>All Truths at all times (and not to conceal,</L>
<L>What may occasion mischiefs) never should</L>
<L>The <HI>Truth</HI> be falsesaid, or Untruths be told:</L>
<L>And, more advantage would to us, ensue</L>
<L>If our <HI>Intelligence</HI> were always true:</L>

<L>As also, very much, related there</L>
<L>To magnifie those who then active were</L>
<L>For our defence. And, I well pleased am</L>
<L>With what may add to their deserved Fame.</L>
<L>To them I grudge no meed, or honour due,</L>
<L>Who prudently, and valiantly pursue</L>
<L>Their undertakings: But, Gods praise alone,</L>
<L>Is my chief Aim. To praise what men have done,</L>
<L>Is, to my proper work impertinent,</L>
<L>And, also, at this time, to my intent.</L>
<L>If, by omitting that, I shall offend</L>
<L>In prosecutions to a better end;</L>
<L>Or, if that any shall maligne me more,</L>
<L>For this, who di<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not love me heretofore,</L>

<L>Which both to <HI>Gods prdise,</HI> and <HI>Mans welfare are</HI> tends,</L>
<L>Loose daily, very many seeming Friends;</L>
<L>Whereby, if they no whit indamagd are,</L>
<L>I shall not, for what haps to me, much care;</L>
<L>Especially, whilst that, which I designe</L>
<L>Tends to Gods praise (without selfends of mine.)</L>
<L>To which intention, that which now is read</L>
<L>(In these few pages,) is contributed.</L>
<L>And though, like <HI>Jeremiahs Lamentation,</HI></L>
<L>Or <HI>Davids humblings,</HI> this <HI>Humiliation</HI></L>
<L>Is not besprinkled with corporeal tears,</L>
<L>Or, worded with Hyberbolies like theirs;</L>
<L>Nor strowd with Ashes, nor in Haircloth drest;</L>
<L>Or, with such formal-complements exprest,</L>
<L>(As may be, and ofttimes assumed are</L>

<L>What, he hath done, at this time, seems to me</L>
<L>Not so much heeded as it ought to be,</L>
<L>To make us thankful; nor do we express</L>
<L>What we pretend, in way of thinkfulness</L>
<L>As it becomes us; neither do we show it</L>
<L>As doth beseem <HI>him,</HI> unto whom we ow it:</L>
<L>But, act it with such vain appurtenances</L>
<L>(And break out into such Extravagances)</L>
<L>As, to our Sins, are rather an addition</L>
<L>Then signes of <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> or true <HI>Contrition.</HI></L>

<L>What streights, and what great hazzards they were in;</L>

<L>Thus much is likely, we were so intrapt,</L>
<L>That, by our own <HI>powre,</HI> we had not escapt</L>
<L>A total Rout, if <HI>Providentially</HI></L>

<L>Which our <HI>Foes</HI> ought to heed, as much as <HI>We.</HI></L>

<L>In hope, that some, the same in mind will carry.</L>
