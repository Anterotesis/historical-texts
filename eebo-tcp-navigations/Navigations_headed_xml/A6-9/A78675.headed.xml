<HEAD>A TRUE RELATION Of the discovery of the PLOT <HI>AGAINST</HI> LYNNE IN <HI>NORFOLK,</HI> Tuesday the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1644.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Aster <HI>Roger Le Strange,</HI> third sonne to Sir <HI>Hamond Le Strange,</HI> sent for Captaine <HI>Thomas Leamon</HI> of <HI>Lynne</HI> to <HI>Apleton</HI> Hall, to the house of one Mr. <HI>Paston</HI> a Papist; And at his comming to him did acquaint him with a designe intended by him against <HI>Lynne,</HI> for which he said he had a Commission from his Majesty to
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>surprise the Towne of <HI>Lynne,</HI> which he presently shew∣ed him, and told him, that if he would undertake to be assistant to him, and raise a party within the Towne to effect the designe, that he should have one thousand pound for his paines, and what preferment he would desire, either in the Towne, or in his Majesties Navy; and further he told him, that the King did value the surprising of that Towne, as halfe his Crowne, and that within tenne dayes after certaine notice that the Towne was reduced, that his Majesty would send a sufficient power to their reliefe, and that those forces should be under the command of the Lord <HI>Goring;</HI> to which Plot the said Captaine <HI>Leamon</HI> for his owne pre∣sent security (having taken the Covenant) and well weighing the peace and good of the Common-wealth, for the present seethingly gave consent; the night then comming on he departed from him, with promise to come to him againe the next day to advise further of the designe, but presently hasting to <HI>Lynne,</HI> went to the Governour Collonel <HI>Ʋalentine Walton,</HI> and ac∣quainted him with it; who after long debate resolved the next day, that at the time appointed he should go to him to the said <HI>Apleton</HI> Hall, and take with him a Corpo∣rall of his, clad in Sea-mans habit, who seemingly should be a partaker with him, to effect their designe, and comming thither the said Master <HI>Strange</HI> demanded of Captaine <HI>Leamon</HI> what he was that came with him, who answered that he was a man for their turne: and immediately the said Corporall answered very dis∣creetly, saying, he was a poor man living in Fisher-end in <HI>Lyn,</HI> and kept an Ale-house, and that he was forty pounds the worse for the Round heads; Master <HI>Strange</HI> replyed, its no matter, for when the designe is accom∣plished,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>thou shalt have one hundred pound for it, and a Cannoneers place, which he seemingly was well plea∣sed with. But the better to know where the Commis∣sion was, then said Captain <HI>Leamon,</HI> Master <HI>Strange</HI> my friend (by the way as I came) demanded of me what security you had, if in case the plot should be disco∣vered, to save them from the Gallowes. Captaine <HI>Lea∣mon</HI> told him you had the Kings Commission, which he desired to see. Master <HI>Strange</HI> went immediately to a hole in the Canapy of his bed, and produced the Com∣mission, and read it to him; after he had read it, he put it in his pocket: in the interim came Lieutenant <HI>Iohn Stubbing,</HI> Lieutenant to Major <HI>Moll,</HI> with five souldiers more, all in the habit of poore Sea-men, appareld as Ship broken men, with a Warrant to attach suspitious persons, which came begging to the dore, and getting within the Court-yard of the said house, being so ap∣pointed by the said Governour, as soone as they came up to the doore, the Gentlewoman of the house came running up to the said Mr. <HI>Strange,</HI> and told him there was fix or seaven poore Souldiers come from <HI>Lynn,</HI> a begging; Master <HI>Strange</HI> immediatly sent them downe Twelve pence, and wished them to be gone; And when Mistris <HI>Paston</HI> went downe, Master <HI>Strange</HI> went to barre the doore, which Captaine <HI>Leamon</HI> seeing, gave a winke upon the said Corporall to lay hold upon the said Master <HI>Strange,</HI> which done, gave a stampe with his foot, by which the Lieutenant knew what hee had to doe, and then Master <HI>Strange,</HI> see∣ing hee was betrayed, conveyed his Commission to the said Captaine <HI>Leamon,</HI> then the Lieutenant, not taking notice of the said Captaine, as one that should be∣tray the said Master <HI>Strange,</HI> did Attach the said Master
<PB N="8" REF="5"/><HI>Strange</HI> as an enemy to the Common weale, and de∣manded his name, which he refused to mention, and after that required his Commission, which hee de∣nyed to have any: Then the said Lieutenant seeing the said Captaine <HI>Leamon,</HI> demanded what hee did there, consulting against the State, telling him hee was a stinking knave, and searched him for the Com∣mission, and took it from him, and set a Guard over the said Captaine <HI>Leamon,</HI> and another over the said Master <HI>Strange,</HI> and would not suffer them to speak each to other, by the way from the said <HI>Apleton-Hall</HI> to <HI>Lynne,</HI> whether they were brought Prisoners to the Governour, with the Commission, which was done by order and consent of the said Captaine <HI>Lea∣mon,</HI> before the taking of the said Master <HI>Strange,</HI> which said Master <HI>Strange</HI> is brought up to <HI>London,</HI> and committed to safe custody.</P>
