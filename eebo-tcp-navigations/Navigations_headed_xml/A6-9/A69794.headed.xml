<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING often Observed, that Re∣lations
of Travels, Voyages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are generally very Acceptable to the
Genius of the English Nation, I
judged that it might not be altogether Imperti∣nent
to give a brief Account of some remarkable
Observations made during my Abode in Foreign
Countries, especially having Travelled for the
space of Sixteen Years through <HI>Holland, Ger∣many,
Sweden, Denmark,</HI> and other conside∣rable
Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I easily foresee, that it will be soon Objected,
that after so great a Man as Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI>
who hath already Published a full and incompara∣ble
Description of the Policy and Government of
the States of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> it would
be a vain Presumption to attempt any farther on
that Subject. However, without derogating from
his Honour, I have here inserted divers particular
Remarks, not mention'd by him, but such as Tra∣vellers
may make Use of to very good purpose,
for whose Information this small Essay is chiefly
<PB REF="3"/>
design'd. And it will be the more eminently
Useful at this time, in respect of the great num∣ber
of English Gentlemen, that now Travel that
way. Wherefore I doubt not, but this will be a
sufficient Plea to cover me from the Imputation of
Vanity, and to make it appear, that what I have
here perform'd, is only intended for the publick
Service in general, and the particular Assistance
of those Gentlemen, who shall hereafter Travel
through these Countries. The Lists of the Passage
Boats and Wagons in <HI>Holland,</HI> with the Hours of
their going off, which I have inserted, the Tra∣veller
will find extreamly Useful.</P>
<P>As for the Relation of the Kings Voyage to
<HI>Holland,</HI> annexed at the end. I Confess indeed,
That it deserves to be Written by an abler Hand;
but being at that time at the <HI>Hague,</HI> I was in∣duced
by Curiosity, to take an exact Account of
this so extraordinary a Solemnity, which I did at
first for my own private Use, but have now Pub∣lished
it through the importunity of some Friends.
The Prospects of the Triumphal Arches, Pyra∣mids,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are exactly Copied from the Original
Draughts taken at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and are the true
Representations of them.</P>

<HEAD>A
DESCRIPTION
OF
HOLLAND:
With some Necessary
DIRECTIONS
FOR
Such as intend to Travel through
the Province of HOLLAND,
GERMANY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS they that confine themselves to
their own Country, have not the
opportunity to see and observe
Rarities in other Parts of the
World; so, such as go into Foreign Places,
rather Wander at Random, than Travel, who
have not the Curiosity to commit to Me∣mory
or Writing such Things they meet
with, both for their own and others Satisfa∣ction,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
as may demonstrate the Fruits of their
Travels.</P>
<P>I confess, all Travellers are not of alike
Temper; some delight themselves in Con∣templation
of the Curiosities of Arts; some
are taken with the Varieties of the Works of
Nature; others speculate, with a kind of Re∣verence,
the Decays and Ruins of Antiquity;
others studiously inform themselves with the
Transactions of Modern Times; others with
the Government and Polity; others speculate
the strange Cust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Fashions of the Pla∣ces
they pass through; to be short, every one
labours to entertain the Reader with those
Objects and Rarities of Foreign Parts his Ge∣nius
and Inclination is most affected with.</P>
<P>As to my self, although during the space of
16 Years Travel, I might have enlarged, ac∣cording
to the Curiosity and Opportunity I
have had in the rehearsal of many rare and
exquisite Things very observable; yet my
chief Aim was, to make such Remarks as
might most contribute to the common Good
of Human Society and Civil Life, in taking
notice of the Government and Polity of the
several States and Dominions where I have
been, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>United Provinces, Germany,
Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and other Countries, whose
natural Temper and Disposition seemed to
me most to sympathize with our English
Nation, and thereby have an occasion to do
some good to my own Country. Expect
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
not, Reader, a like punctualness, as to all the
forementioned places, because very many
things, which I might have observed, are
much agreeing, and so may be referred to
what shall be spoken of the Polity and Go∣vernment
of <HI>Holland,</HI> which, for Reasons I
shall by and by hint at, is the chief End I
aimed at in this Treatise.</P>
<P>We will begin then in the first place with
the Commonwealth of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Domi∣nions
of the States General, which thô for
some years were in a declining condition, and
their Forces exceedingly weakened, by rea∣son
of that fatal War it managed against <HI>Eng∣land,
France,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> unto
which, if we add the intestine Divisions of
those two Factions, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and
<HI>Lovestein,</HI> that Politick Body, was so totter'd
and torn, as did threaten its utter and total
Ruine.</P>
<P>But as Bodies, whether Natural or Politick,
after that a violent Fit hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore shaken, dissi∣pated,
and exhausted their Spirits, may reco∣ver
vigor, and look lively again, if so be the
Radical Constitution and Natural Temper
be not wholly changed and depraved; even
so this Commonwealth of <HI>Holland</HI> hath visibly
recovered Strength again, and attained its
former Force and Lustre.</P>
<P>We will therefore make some Remarks,
as to the Defects and Failings (observed not
only by me, but also by others) which that
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
famous Commonwealth hath of late years
been guilty of; which I shall do not out of
any Malice, or design of Reflection, the in∣tention
of writing this Treatise being simply
to insert those Defaults which the wisest of
Authors have always judged necessary, not
only for the Reformation of this, but of all
States whatsoever.</P>
<P>This Commonwealth of <HI>Holland</HI> hath wor∣thily
been the Wonder of all <HI>Europe</HI> during
this last Age, and perhaps not to be parallell'd
in the Records of former Times; for if we
consider how many years it was assaulted by
the then most Potent Prince of <HI>Europe,</HI> who
aspired to no less than the Universal Empire;
and that how formidable soever he were, yet
they not only maintained their Pretensions,
but with uninterrupted Prosperity and Suc∣cefsfulness
adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed their Trade, and spread
their Conquests in all the four Parts of the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> it self, though most famous and vi∣ctorious,
yet could not, as is be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieved, in so
short a time do what by this Commonwealth
hath been effected. In <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> they
soon forced the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>Portugueses</HI> to
yield to them most of their Trade and Pos∣sessions:
And thô <HI>England</HI> put in for a share,
yet they were a long while vigorously op∣posed
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to this hour have
enough to do to keep what they have got∣ten;
so that in less than 100 years this Com∣monwealth
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
by their Industry, and Art in
Trading, are become so excessive Rich and
Potent, that they began to Insult, and would
needs be Arbitrators to their Neighbouring
Princes and States, and encroach upon their
Territories and Dominions.</P>
<P>This drew upon them that fatal War be∣fore-mentioned,
by which they were sorely
weaken'd and brought so low, that except
GOD by a more than ordinary Providence
had protected and appeared for them, they
had certainly been ruinated, and never able
to recover themselves again; however, their
Pride hereby was much abated: And as
Luxury and Lasciviousness are the sad Effects
of Prosperity, as well as Pride; so such Vices
in a Body Politick and Commonwealth as do
corrupt the Radical Humours, by abating the
Vigour of the Vital Parts, do insensibly tend
to the Consumption and Decay of the whole.</P>
<P>That this Commonwealth hath much re∣covered
its Strength, may clearly appear, if
we consider what great Things they have ef∣fected
since the little time they have enjoyed
Peace: They have in less than 7 Years built
about 40 gallant Ships of War; They have
laid out vast Sums of Treasure in refortifying
<HI>Narden, Maestricht, Breda,</HI> the <HI>Grave,</HI> and many
other Places; They have paid vast Sums of
Money to their Allies for their Auxiliary
Troops, as also 200000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling to the King
of <HI>England</HI> to Enjoy their Peace with him. And
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
besides all this, their Encrease in Riches and
Power may be guessed at, by the many stately
Houses built within these 5 Years in <HI>Amster∣dam,
Rotterdam,</HI> and other Places; to all which
we may add, to what excessive height the
Actions of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Company
are risen, and the Obligations from the States
are so esteemed as to Security, that they can
get as much Mony as they please at 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
Not to speak of the exceeding Encrease of
their Subjects, occasioned by the <HI>French</HI> King's
Tyranny against the distressed Protestants in
<HI>France, Alsace,</HI> and other parts of his Con∣quests;
neither will we speak of other Signs
of the Encrease of this Commonwealth, as
not judging it convenient to commit them
to Paper, but will now proceed to shew the
Method of Living and Travelling in the
Dominions and Places of the States, which,
if you do well consider, you may see how
happy and easy the Government of <HI>England</HI>
is, above that of other Nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briell</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> is the usual place where
the Pacquet and King's Pleasure-boats bring
on such as come to see the United Provin∣ces;
but of late <HI>Helvoet-Sluys</HI> is the place the
Pacquet comes to, as being the more conve∣nient
Port: Here be sure to furnish your self
well with Money. From hence you take a
Boat to <HI>Maesland-Sluys</HI> or <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> which,
if you go in Company with others, will only
cost you 5 Stivers; but if you take one for
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
your self, will cost 25 Stivers for <HI>Maeseland-Sluce,</HI>
and a Ducatoon to <HI>Rotterdam:</HI> The
fifth part of which goes to the States for a
Tax, they call <HI>Passagie Gelt;</HI> and the other
four parts are for the Boat-Men or Schippers,
who also out of their Gains must pay a Tax
to the States, so that by Computation you
pay a fifth Penny to the States for your Tra∣velling
either in Boats by Water, or in Wa∣gons
by Land.</P>
<P>As you pass by <HI>Maseland-Sluce</HI> you will see
a very fair Fishing Village, to which belong
near Two hundred Herring Busses, but if
you go by the way of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> you Sail by
two old Towns, called <HI>Flardin</HI> and <HI>Schiedam:</HI>
Yet let me advise you before you depart from
the <HI>Briell,</HI> to take a serious view of it, as be∣ing
the City which in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time
was one of the Cautionary Towns Pawned
to <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Briell</HI> had a Voice among
the States, but by reason <HI>Rotterdam</HI> hath got
away their Trade, by which having lost its
former Lustre, is now become a Fishing Town
only.</P>
<P><HI>Rotterdam</HI> is the Second City for Trade in
<HI>Holland,</HI> and by some is called, <HI>Little London,</HI>
as having vast Traffick with <HI>England,</HI> inso∣much,
that many of the Citizens Speak good
English. There are in this City two consi∣derable
Churches of English and Scotch:
And how great a Trade they drive with the
King of <HI>England</HI>'s Subjects is evident, for in
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
the year 1674, at the opening of the Waters,
after a great Frost, there departed out of
<HI>Rotterdam</HI> 300. Sail of English, Scotch, and
Irish Ships at once with an Easterly Wind:
And if a Reason should be demanded, how
it comes to pass that so many English Ships
should frequently come to that Haven, It is
easily answered, because they can ordinarily
Load and Unload, and make returns to <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> before a Ship can get
clear from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and the <HI>Texel:</HI> And
therefore your English Merchants find it
Cheaper, and more Commodious for Trade,
that after their Goods are arrived at <HI>Rotter∣dam,</HI>
to send their Goods in Boats Landward
into <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>This City is Famous, as being the place
where great <HI>Erasmus</HI> was Born, whose Statue
of Brass stands erected in the Market-place:
And although the Buildings here are not so
superb as those of <HI>Amsterdam, Leyden,</HI> or
<HI>Haerlem,</HI> yet the places worth the seeing, are,
first, the great Church, where several Ad∣mirals
lie stately Entombed; here you see
their Admiralty, East-India, and Stadt-Houses,
together with that called, <HI>Het Gemeen Lands
Huis.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rotterdam</HI> you may for five Stivers
have a Boat to bring you to <HI>Delft,</HI> but before
you come thither you pass through a fair
Village called <HI>Overschie,</HI> where the French
and English Youths are trained up in Litte∣rature,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
as to the Latin and Dutch Tongue,
Book-keeping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From thence in the same
Boat you come to <HI>Delft</HI> which is Famous for
making of Porceline to that degree, that it
much resembles the <HI>China,</HI> but only it is not
Transparent.</P>
<P>In <HI>Delft</HI> is the great Magazin of Arms for
the whole Province of <HI>Holland:</HI> Their
Churches are very large, in one of which
are Tombs of the Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> Admi∣ral
<HI>Tromp,</HI> and General <HI>Morgans</HI> Lady, and
in the Cloister over against the Church, you
have an Inscription in a Pillar of Brass, shew∣ing
after what manner <HI>William</HI> the First, that
Famous Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was shot to Death
by a Miscreant Jesuit, with his deserved
Punishment.</P>
<P><HI>Delft</HI> hath the third Voice in the States of
<HI>Holland,</HI> and sends its Deputies unto the Col∣lege
of the States General, and to all other
Colleges of the Commonwealth. They
have also a Chamber in the <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany,
as shall be more largely spoken to,
when we shall come to Treat of the State
of the said Company.</P>
<P>From <HI>Delft</HI> you may by Boat be brought
to the <HI>Hague</HI> for two Stivers and an half;
which is accounted the fairest Village in the
World, both for pompous Buildings, and
the largeness thereof; here the Princes of
<HI>Orange</HI> hold their Residence, as also the States
General, and the Council of State; here you
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
have the Courts of Justice, Chancery, and
other Courts of Law. Here you see that
great Hall, in which many Hundreds of
Colours are hung up in Trophy, taken
from the Emperor, Spaniard, and other Po∣tentates
with whom they have waged War.
Their Council Chambers are admired by all
that see them. Many fair Libraries they
have belonging to particular Men. The
Princes Palace is a most superb Building,
and there are many costly Gardens adjoyn∣ing
to the <HI>Hague,</HI> together with that to the
Princes House in the Wood, in which House
are in a large Hall the most rare and costly
Pictures of <HI>Europe;</HI> there also are those Mag∣nificent
and Unparalell'd Gardens of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eer
<HI>Bentham</HI> of <HI>Amesland</HI> and others. I might
here speak of the splendor of His Majesties
Court in <HI>Holland,</HI> of his Noble Virtues and Va∣lour,
of the most Virtuous and Beautiful Prin∣cess
his Royal Consort, but I dare not, least
I should infinitely fall short of what ought to
be, and which others have already done be∣fore
me: And therefore leaving the <HI>Hague,</HI>
I shall only tell you that from thence you
may for seven Stivers have a Boat to bring
you to <HI>Leyden. Leyden</HI> is a fair and great
City, and the University is very Famous,
there being continually in it 1000 Students
from all parts, as <HI>Hungary, Poland, Germany,</HI>
yea from the Ottomans Empire it self, who
pretend to be Grecians, besides the English,
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
Scots, and Irish, who this year were num∣bred
to be above 80.</P>
<P>The most remarkable Things here to be
seen, I shall summarily set down: As the place
called the <HI>Bergh,</HI> formerly a Castle belong∣ing
to the Prince of <HI>Liege</HI> in <HI>Flanders:</HI> The
Stadt-house, the University Schools, especially
that of the Anatomy, which excels all the
Anatomy Schools in the World, a Book of
the Rarities whereof you may have for six
Stivers; their Physick Garden, and the Pro∣fessors
Closet are all Ravishing in rare Curi∣osities.
But as to their Colleges, they are
but two, and very small, not to be compa∣red
with the smallest Halls in <HI>Oxford,</HI> neither
have they any Endowments, their mainte∣nance
being only from the Charitable Col∣lections
of the Ministers of <HI>Holland;</HI> neither
are any Students to remain longer there than
till they attain the Degree of Batchelors of
Art: One of the Curators being demanded
by me, Why so Rich a Commonwealth as
<HI>Holland</HI> is, did not Build and Endow Col∣leges
after the manner of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cam∣bridge;</HI>
answered, They had not so many
able and publick spirited Men as are in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and to deal plainly with you, said he,
had we such Colleges, our Burghermasters and
Magistrates would fill them with their own
and their Friends Sons, who by leading a
lazie and idle Life, would never become
capable to serve the Commonwealth, and
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
therefore he judged it much better to put
them to Pension in Burghers-Houses, leaving
them to the care of the Professors, who are
very diligent in keeping the Students at their
Exercises, both at publick Lectures, and in
their private Houses also, where they cause
them punctually at their appointed Hours to
come to their Examinations and Lectures,
besides those they have in publick. Their
Churches are rare, so are their Walks round
the City, and the Fortifications very pleasing
to behold. Here you have the River <HI>Rhine</HI>
running through the City, and falling into
it from <HI>Catwyck op Zee. Leyden</HI> is very Fa∣mous
in History for the long Siege it held
out against the Spaniard. From hence for
12 Stivers and an half you are brought to
<HI>Haerlem</HI> by Water, being 12 English Miles.</P>
<P><HI>Harlem</HI> is Famous, in that <HI>Costor</HI> one of
their Burghers, first Invented the Art of <HI>Prin∣ting.</HI>
This <HI>Costor</HI> being suspected to be a
Conjurer, was fain to flee from <HI>Haerlem</HI> to
<HI>Cologne</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and there perfected his
Invention, having in <HI>Haerlem</HI> only found out
the way of Printing on one side of the Paper.
The first Book he ever Printed is kept in the
Stadt-house, for those that are curious to see
it. Here is one of the fairest and largest
Churches of the Seventeen Provinces, in the
Walls whereof there remain to this day stick∣ing,
Cannon Bullets, shot by the Spaniards
during the Siege thereof. In this Church
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
are three Organs, as also the model of the
three Ships that Sailed from <HI>Haerlem</HI> to <HI>Dami∣ater,</HI>
seizing the Castle in which the Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI> was kept a Prisoner, and brought
him away to <HI>Holland:</HI> In the Tower of this
Church hang two Silver Bells, which they
also brought from thence, and now Ring
them every Night at nine a Clock.</P>
<P><HI>Haerlem</HI> is Renowned for making the finest
Linnen Cloth, Tyffinies, Damasks, and
Silk Stuffs; also Ribands and Tapes: They
have Mills by which they can Weave 40 or
50 pieces at a time; they make the finest
white Thread and Tapes for Lace in the
whole World; their Bleacheries surpass all
other whatsoever, their Waters whitening
Cloth better than any in the Seventeen
Provinces: They have a most pleasant Grove
like a little Wood, divided into Walks, where
on Sundays and Holy-days the Citizens of
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> and other places come to take
their pleasure. <HI>Haerlem</HI> is the Second City
of <HI>Holland,</HI> and sends in Deputies unto all the
Colleges of the Government. From hence
you have a passage by Boat to <HI>Amsterdam</HI>
for six Stivers, but when you are come half
way, you must step out of one Boat to go
into another, where you see a stately Palace,
where the Lords, called <HI>Dykgraves</HI> sit; every
one of these Lords hath his Apartment when
he comes for the Concerns of the Sea-dykes
and Banks: Here are also two large Sluces,
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
having Gates to let in or out Water from the
<HI>Haerlemmer Meer.</HI> Near this place about
<HI>Anno</HI> 1672, a part of the Sea-Bank was bro∣ken
by a strong North-West Wind, drown∣ing
all the Land betwixt <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and
<HI>Haerlem,</HI> which cost an incredible vast Sum
to have it repaired. They sunk in this
Breach 400 small Vessels fil'd with Earth and
Stones, for a Foundation to rebuild the Wall
upon, and by unspeakable Industry and
Charges at last repaired the Bank.</P>
<P>I come now to speak of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which
having been the place of my abode for se∣veral
years, I shall give a more large and
punctual account thereof then I do of other
Places: It is esteemed by Intelligent Men,
the Second City in the World for Trade,
and not inferiour to any in Wealth. Cer∣tainly
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> is one of the Beautifullest
Cities in the World, their Buildings are
large, their Streets for the most part plea∣santly
Planted with Trees, and Paved so
neatly, as is to be found no where else in any
Country, save in some of the Seventeen Pro∣vinces.
And although, as I have already
said, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> may justly be taken for the
Second or Third City after <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI>
yet it hath neither Court nor University as
they have. And now in treating of all the
Excellences and Virtues of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I
shall not hyperbolize or flatter; for before
I have done, you shall see, I shall also faith∣fully
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
declaim against the Evils, Mistakes, and
Vices in it.</P>
<P><HI>Amsterdam</HI> stands upon 1000 Morgans of
Land, encompassed with a very strong Wall
and Bastions most pleasant to behold, with
a very large Gracht or Ditch for the defence
of three parts of the City, the fourth being
secured by an Arm of the Sea called the
River <HI>Y,</HI> or (as the <HI>English</HI> Men corruptly
call it) the <HI>Ty.</HI> There are 13 Churches in
this City for those of the Reformed Religion
(called <HI>Dutch Presbyterians)</HI> to meet and
worship in, with two <HI>French,</HI> one <HI>High-Dutch,</HI>
and one <HI>English,</HI> all Presbyterian Churches,
who only are allowed Bells, and whose Mi∣nisters
are maintained by the Magistrate.
All these Churches or Congregations make
up only a third part of the Inhabitants of the
City. The <HI>Papists,</HI> who have 85 Houses or
Chapels to meet in for their Worship, make
another third part, and have a long Square
of Houses for their Nuns to live in, who are
not shut up in Cloisters, as in Papist Coun∣tries
they are wont to do, but may go in and
out at their pleasure, yea and Marry also, if
they grow weary of a Nunnish Life. These
Churches of the Papists have no Bells allow'd
them, being look'd upon as Conventicles, and
are many times shut up, and again opened at
the <HI>Scout</HI>'s pleasure. The other third part
of the City is made up by <HI>Jews, Lutherans,
Armenians, Brownists</HI> or <HI>English Independants,
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
Anabaptists,</HI> and the <HI>Quakers:</HI> None of which,
as was also said of the Papists, have Bells al∣lowed
them, but are accounted Conventi∣cles;
and all that Marry amongst them must
first be married by the Magistrate, and then
(if they please) among themselves in their
own Assemblies; neither are any of them
admitted unto any Office in the Govern∣ment,
but such only as are of the Reformed
or Presbiterian Profession.</P>
<P>The Jews, who are very considerable in
the Trade of this City, have two Syna∣gogues,
one whereof is the largest in Chri∣stendom,
and as some say, in the World;
sure I am, it far exceeds those in <HI>Rome, Ve∣nice,</HI>
and all other places where I have been.
Within the Court-yard where their Syna∣gogue
stands, they have several Rooms or
Schools, where their Children are taught
Hebrew, and very carefully (to the shame of
Christians negligence) brought up and in∣structed
in the Jewish Principles.</P>
<P><HI>Amsterdam,</HI> for the wise Statesmen it hath
produced, is said to be a second <HI>Athens;</HI>
others make it the Storehouse or Magazine
of <HI>Europe,</HI> for that it hath such great store of
Corn, wherewith it furnishes many other Na∣tions.
And secondly, for the exceeding great
Magazine of Spices, which in ancient times
the <HI>Venetians</HI> brought by Land, furnishing all
Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> but now is done by the <HI>East-India</HI>
Company, which not only supplies
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
<HI>Europe</HI> therewith, but many places in the
<HI>Indies</HI> also. Thirdly, It hath inconceivable
Store of all manner of Provisions for War,
insomuch, that <HI>England</HI> and divers other
Nations send to <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to buy Arms,
Buff-Coats, Belts, Match, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yea, here
are several Shop-keepers who can deliver
Arms for four or five Thousand Men, and
at a cheaper rate than can be got any where
else; and this they can do by reason of their
great Industry in the Ingrossing most of the
Iron Works on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and other Rivers,
which run into <HI>Holland.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Amster∣dam</HI>
hath more store of sawed and prepared
Timber for Shipping than can be found in
any one Nation in the World; and this is
the Reason why her Neighbor Town <HI>Sardam</HI>
is made capable of Building Ships 20 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> cheaper than they can do in <HI>England</HI>
or <HI>France:</HI> So that both <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
do many times buy them in <HI>Holland:</HI> As
lately the King of <HI>Spain</HI> bought Ten Capital
Ships of the two Brothers the <HI>Melts</HI> Mer∣chants
in this City. Fifthly, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is
the Staple where the Emperor sells his Quick-silver,
not only to the Spaniard, to use in
his Mines in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but for the making
of <HI>Cinoprium</HI> or <HI>Vermillion,</HI> with which <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI>
furnisheth not only <HI>Europe,</HI> but ma∣ny
places in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is the Market where
the French King bought his Marble for <HI>Ver∣sailles▪</HI>

<P>THE STADT HOUSE OF AMSTERDAM</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="13"/>
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
Chorus of Voices, it hath 52 whole Stops
besides half Stops, and hath two rows of
Keys for the Feet, and three rows of Keys
for the Hands; I have had People of Qua∣lity
to hear it Play, who could not believe
but that there were Men or Women above,
Singing in the Organ, until they were con∣vinced
by going up into the Organ Room:
The Second, Is such a large Carved Pulpet
and Canopy as cannot be found elsewhere in
the World: The Third, Is a Screen of Brass.</P>
<P>The Stadthouse, or Guild-hall of <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI>
is deservedly admired and talked of by
all the World, it is in Truth a most neat and
splendid Pile of Building, and the Reader
will not be displeased, I believe, if I enlarge
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little in its Description. This Noble Town-House
then, is Built all of Free-Stone, ac∣cording
to the Modern Architecture of the
Corinthian Order, Adorned with Statues in
Brass, and Carving in Marble by the best
Masters of the Age. A Prospect whereof
see in the following Figure. It is 282 Foot
wide, 232 Foot deep, and 116 Foot high,
besides the Tower. The Foundation is laid
upon 13659 Piles of Wood driven into the
Ground; the first Stone of it was laid <HI>Octo∣ber</HI>
28. 1648. In the middle over the Cor∣nish,
and just before the Tower, is a very
handsome piece of Carving in Marble of 82
Foot long, and 18 Foot high, wherein the
City of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is represented by a Wo∣man,
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
on whose Right Hand sits the God
<HI>Neptune,</HI> with his Trident, and two Sea-Goddesses
bring her the Fruits of the Earth.
On her Left, two <HI>Naïdes</HI> present her with
Laurels and Palms; and before her two Tri∣tons
Dance and Sound their Horns. On the
top of this stands an Image of Brass, repre∣senting
Peace, and one on each side repre∣senting
Providence and Justice, each Figure
being 12 Foot high. And on the back part
of the Building to answer, is such another
piece of Carving, in Marble also, shewing
the Grandeur and Commerce of the City;
in the middle sits a Woman, having on her
Head the Hat with Wings of <HI>Mercury;</HI> be∣hind
her is seen the Masts and Sails of a Ship,
and round about her lies all sorts of Mathe∣matical
Instruments used in Sailing; at her
Feet lie the two Rivers <HI>Y</HI> and <HI>Amstel,</HI> and
on each side, the Inhabitants of the Four
Parts of the World bring her their Fruits.
Here likewise are placed three Images of
Brass of the same bigness with the other;
that on the top is an <HI>Atlas,</HI> bearing a very
large Globe of Copper, on the right Hand,
one representing Temperance, and on the
left Justice. On each of the four Corners of
the Building, over the Cornish, stand four
Eagles of Brass supporting an Imperial Crown,
all finely Gilt. In the middle is erected a
very handsom round Tower, advanced a∣bout
50 Foot above the rest of the Building,
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>
the Roof supported by Pillars, and adorned
with Images; in it hang a very curious
Chime of Bells, which at certain times be∣ing
played on by a Person maintained for
that purpose, afford a very agreeable Mu∣sick.
So much for the out side. And now
let us enter, which you may by Seven little
Arched Doors, which let you into the Porch,
from whence you enter the House by two
large Gates, between which opening by
Windows, (with Bars of Cast-Brass) to the
Street, stands the Justice-Hall for Trial of
Criminals, which is Adorned with many
curious Carvings in Marble of Ingenious De∣vices,
which would be too long to describe
particularly. Below Stairs, within side, is
kept the Office of the Bank, where the
Merchants write off their Money, the
Prisons both for Debtors and Criminals,
the Guard Chamber where the Citizens
keep the Head-Watch, and where the
Keys of the City Gates are kept lockt up in
a Chest every Night, and some other Offices.
From hence you ascend by a handsome
broad pair of Stairs, though not very light,
into the Burghers-Hall, which is 120 Foot
long, 57 Foot broad, and 98 Foot high,
in the Floor whereof are inlaid in Marble
the two Faces of the Terrestrial Globe, and
that of the Coelestial, which ingeniously
shews, as in a Map, the Situation of the
Countries of the Earth, and the Constella∣tions
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>
in the Heavens: Each of which Maps
is 22 Foot Diameter. At the end of this
Hall is the Scheepens Chamber, where are
Tryed all Civil Causes between Man and
Man, and in the Galleries (which go round
two square Courts on each side the Hall, for
convenience of Light) are the several Cham∣bers,
or Offices, belonging to the Govern∣ment;
as the Council Chamber, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Common Council of the City, who
make Laws, choose the Burghermasters, and
Scheepens, Deputies for the States, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
Burghermasters Chamber, who sit there daily
to Administer the Government: The Bur∣ghermasters
withdrawing Room: The Schee∣pens
Extraordinary Chamber: The Trea∣sury
Chambers, Ordinary and Extraordinary:
The Chamber of Accounts: That of the
Commissioners for Bankrupts: Another for
the Commissioners for Tryal of small Causes,
like our Court of Conscience: And one for
the Commissioners of the Hospitals; with
two or three more belonging to the several
Secretaries, all which are beautified with fine
Paintings, and ingenious Devices carved in
Marble over the Door of each Chamber; to
give a particular Description of which would
take up a Volume, which is not agreeable to
what I here pretend, these being only short
Remarks to put young Travallers in mind
of what is most worthy their Observation.
I shall only therefore say in general, that it
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>
is already a very noble, beautiful, and costly
Building, and is a sufficient intimation of the
Richness of the City, but should they finish
it within side as they pretend, by Painting
the Ceilings, and Facing the Walls with
Marble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it would make it incompara∣bly
the finest and costliest in the World.
Over these Chambers, in the second Story,
is kept a large Magazine of Arms, which
takes up one Angle of the Building, and is
very compleatly Furnished; the Arms are
all kept in Presses shut up, to avoid the in∣jury
of the Weather; the rest of the House
above is not used, or Furnished at all. One
thing I must not omit, and that is, That
there are Eight Cisterns of Water kept always
full at the top of the House, which by Pipes
may be let down into every Room, to quench
any accidental Fire; and the Chimneys are
all lined with Copper, the former Stadthouse
having been Burnt down by Accident.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed, and speak of their
Alms-houses, and of the Government of the
Poor, of their Prisons, and Houses of Cor∣rection.
This City is said to have 20000
Poor every day at Bed and Board. The
Alms-houses are many, and look more like
Princes Palaces than Lodgings for Poor Peo∣ple:
First, there are Houses for Poor old
Men and Women, then a large square Pa∣lace
for 300 Widows, then there are Hos∣pitals
for Boys and Girls, for Burghers Chil∣dren,
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>
and for Strangers Children, or those
called Foundlings; all these Boys and Girls
have every Sunday, and other days of Wor∣ship,
two Doites given them by the Fathers
of these Houses, the which the Children put
into the Deacons Bag when they gather for
the Poor in the Churches: Then there is an
Hospital for Fools, and a Bedlam: There
are Houses where common Beggers, and
Gamesters, and frequenters of Tap-houses
are kept hard at Work: There is also a House
called, the Rasp-house, where petty Thieves,
and such as flash one another with Knives,
such as beg with cheating Devices, Women
with fained great Bellies, Men pretending to
have been taken by the Turks, others that
pretend Wreck at Sea, and such as Beg with
a Clapper, or a Bell, as if they could not
Speak or Hear, such as these are kept hard
at Work, Rasping every day 50 pounds be∣tween
two of them, or else are beaten with
a Bulls Pissel, and if yet they Rebel, and
wont Work, they are set in a Tub, where
if they do not Pump, the Water will swell
over their Heads: Then there is a House
where Whores are kept to Work, as also
dis-Obedient Children, who live Idle, and
take no Course to maintain themselves; like∣wise
Women commonly drinking themselves
Drunk, and Scolds; all these sorts of Hospi∣tals,
and Alms-houses are stately Buildings,
richly Adorned with Pictures, and their
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
Lodgings very neat and clean. In some, of
the Boys and Girls Hospitals there are 1500,
in some 800, and in some 500 in a House;
then they have Houses where a Man or a
Woman may have their Diet, Washing, and
Lodging for his Life, giving a small Sum of
Money; these are called <HI>Brouders</HI> Houses.
The Alms Children of this City are held in
such Veneration and Respect, that a Man had
as good strike a Burghermasters Child as one
of them. These Children are permitted to Tra∣vel
in any of the Treckscuts, or Passage-Boats,
freely without Money: These Hospitals are
Governed by Men and Women, as are of an
unspotted Life, and reputed to be Rich, De∣vout,
and Pious: It is very observable, that
the Women govern their Women Hospitals,
better than the Men do theirs; yea, it is a
general Observation in this Country, that
where the Women have the direction of the
Purse and Trade, the Husband seldom prove
Bankrupts, it being the property of a true
Born Holland-Wife presently after Marriage,
to apply her self wholly to her Business; but
I forbear to say any more of the Dutch-housewives,
for fear of displeasing our English
Dames, not so much addicted, at least not so
generally bred up to Industry; But to return
to the Acts of Charity of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the
which is so extraordinary, that they surpass
all other Cities in the World, for they are
daily and hourly giving to the Poor, every

<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
House in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> hath a Box hanging in
a Chain, on which is Written, <HI>Think on the
Poor,</HI> so that when any Merchant sells Goods,
they commonly conclude no Bargain, but
more or less is put in the Poors Box; these
Boxes are lockt up by the Deacons, who
once a quarter go round the City, and take
the Money out of the Boxes. Then twice a
Week there are Men belonging to the Hos∣pitals
that go round the City, and ring a Bell
at every House, to know what the Master
or Mistriss of the House will give to the
Box, who generally give not less than two
Stivers. Then every first Wednesday of the
Month, the Deacons in their turn, go round
the City, from House to House, to receive
what every House-keeper will give to the
Poor, then on the Week before the Sacra∣ment
is given, a Minister, with an Elder,
goes round the City to every House where
any Members of the Presbiterian Religion
live, and there ask if any differences be in
the Family, offering their Service to recon∣cile
them; also to instruct and prepare such
as are to receive the Sacrament: At this time
a Minister may be seen to go into a Tap-house
or Tavern, for which at another time
he would be counted a Wine-Bibber, and the
worst of Reprobates: At this time while
these Ministers and Elders go about the Ci∣ty
on their Visitations, the People take an
occasion to give to the Poor. And here I
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
ought not to omit telling you of their great
Charity to the distressed French Protestants,
who are here in great Numbers. They main∣tain
no less than 60 French Ministers, and
unto many Handicraft Tradesmen, and
makers of Stuffs, and Cloth, they lend Sums
of Money, without Interest, to buy Work∣ing
Tools, and Materials for their Work;
but this is no other then they formerly did to
the Poor distressed Protestants of <HI>Ireland</HI> and
<HI>Piemont;</HI> and their Charity was not a little
that they gave to <HI>Geneva</HI> towards the Buil∣ding
their Fortifications; and here give me
leave to tell you, what King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
said of the Charity of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> when the
Duke of <HI>Lotherdal,</HI> hearing that the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI>'s Army was not able to oppose the
French from advancing so near to <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI>
the Duke jearingly said, <HI>That Oranges
would be very scarce in</HI> Holland, <HI>after</HI> Amster∣dam
<HI>should fall into the French Hands to plunder.</HI>
To which His Majesty said, <HI>That he was of
Opinion, that God would preserve</HI> Amsterdam
<HI>from being destroyed, if it were only for the great
Charity they have for the Poor,</HI> the which put
the Duke out of Countenance; I will say no
more of their Charity, only this, that they
leave no Stone unturned to bring Monies in∣to
the Poors Stock; they make the Stage-players
pay 80000 Gilders a year to the Poor;
there is not a Rope-Dancer, Poppet-Player, or
any of that sort of unnecessary Vermin which
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
frequent Fairs, but pay the third Penny to
the Poor, which is carefully looked after, by
placing an Alms-man at the Door of the
Booths, to see that they cheat not the Poor
of their share. I shall now in the next place
say something of the Clergy, I mean those
called, <HI>The States Clergy,</HI> for the States are
absolutely Head of their Church; and when
any Synod of Divines meet, two of the States
are always present to hear that they debate
nothing relating, or reflecting on the Go∣vernment,
or Governors; if they do, pre∣sently
the States cry, <HI>Ho la mij<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heeren Pre∣dicanten,</HI>
and if their Ministers meddle with
any thing relating to the Government in
their Pulpits, they send them a Brief, (which
some call a pair of Shooes) to quit the City,
and sometimes Imprison them to Boot; but
if they behave themselves quietly and well,
as they ought to do, they then are respected
by the People as Gods upon Earth: They
have a Form of Prayer sent them how they
shall Pray for the States, and Stadholder,
nor must they meddle with any other Reli∣gion
in the Country, because all sorts are
Tollerated, at least Connived at by the Ma∣gistrates.
All those called the Presbiterian
Ministers, or States Clergy, are obliged
under a Forfeiture to have done Preaching
and Praying by Eleven of the Clock in the
Forenoon on Sundays, because then the
Scheepens go to the Stadthouse, to Marry
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
the Jews, Papists, and Lutherans, and others
that may not marry after the Calvinistical
Form; and the reason why the States thus
marry them first according to Law, is to ren∣der
their Children Legitimate, but they may
marry again afterwards as they please them∣selves:
None may marry until they have
made their appearance at the Stadthouse be∣fore
the Lords; where, if the Parties be
agreed, the Preachers marry the <HI>Calvinists,</HI>
and the Scheepens marry all the rest, who dif∣fer
from the Religion established by Law.</P>
<P>When one dies, the Friends dare not bu∣ry
the Corps until it hath lain three days
open in the Coffin, that the Friends and Re∣lations
of the deceased may be satisfied that
the Party hath not been murdered, or re∣ported
to be dead when alive; after three
days, the Corps must be brought to the
Church before the Bell ceaseth tolling, which
is at two, for if you keep the Body untill half
three, then the Church Doors are lock'd,
and for the first half hour must be paid 25
Gilders, and for the second 50, and so until
six, then they may amerse you as much as
they please.</P>
<P>There are many rich people who make
that default on purpose, that they may have
solemn occasion of giving to the Poor, as I
knew once an English Merchant did.</P>
<P>The next thing I shall speak of, is the me∣thod
which the States observe in ordering
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
their Maritime Affairs, one of the greatest
Mysteries in their Government: The States
General divide their Admiralty into Five
Courts, which they call Chambers. The
First is <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> (which is the Chamber
call'd the <HI>Maese,)</HI> and hath the Admirals
Flag.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which hath the Vice-Admiral's
Flag; and <HI>Zealand</HI> hath the Rear-Admiral's
Flag; the other Two Chambers
are those in <HI>North-Holland</HI> and <HI>Fricsland.</HI> Each
of these Five Chambers have their Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals, apart
from the States-Generals Flags; so that when
the States have occasion to set out a Fleet
of an Hundred Ships, more or less, every
Chamber knows the number they must pro∣vide
for their proportion, though in regard
of its Opulency, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> frequently helps
her Neighbours, and adds two, or more, Ships
than their share comes to. These Cham∣bers
have lately built 36 Men of War, and
now are building of 7 more; and all this is
done without noise, every one building their
proportion: And they have admirable me∣thods
in preserving their Ships when built,
and their Magazines are in good order, eve∣ry
Ship having an Apartment to lay up all
its Equipage in; and at the top of their Ma∣gazines
are vast Cisterns, which are kept
constantly full of Water, having Pipes into
every Apartment to let it down upon any
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
accident of Fire. And there is in their Ma∣gazines
a Nursery Room, where a Woman
keeps an Office, to feed at certain hours of
the day a great number of Cats, which af∣terward
hunt among the Stores for Mice and
Rats. This great Magazine in <HI>Amsterdam</HI>
was built in the time of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> in the
space of 9 months and 14 days, in which
time the Lords of the Admiralty gave the
Workmen <HI>drinkgelt</HI> as they call it, to incou∣rage
them to work more than at an ordina∣ry
rate. At this time, the biggest Man of
War the States had was the <HI>Amelia,</HI> in which
the famous Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> was kill'd; she
was a Ship of no more than 56 Guns, after∣ward
made a Fire-ship. But the States quick∣ly
discovered their want of great Ships, and
therefore built, the same year 20 Men of
War, from 50 to 80 Guns: But the great
Ships built at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> had like to have
proved of no use, had not the ingenious
Pensionary <HI>de Wit</HI> found out a device to carry
them over the <HI>Pampus,</HI> betwixt those they
call Water Ships.</P>
<P>The Admiralty have an excellent method
in setting out their Fleets, they neither press
Soldiers nor Seamen, all go voluntary at the
beating of a Drum, each Captain providing
Men and Provisions for his Ship, who, after
they have received Orders from the Lords
to the Equipage-Master to equip out their
Ships, and receive the Provisions of War,
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
then the States send aboard each Ship a
Chaplain, and Check-master, who take care
of the provision of War, and see that the
Seamen have the States Allowance, and
wholesom Food: And great care is taken by
the Lords, that both Captains and Seamen
receive their Pay punctually for the time
they are in the States Service: And for the
incouraging their Seamen, there is plaistred
on a Board, hanging by the Foremast, the
several Rewards to such as either take or fire
a Flag-ship, or take or sink any other Ship of
the Enemies: Also what Pensions a wounded
Seaman shall have, if maim'd or disabled in
the States Service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords of the Admiralty follow the
same methods which the States-General ob∣serve,
as to their Land Obligations, and go
through this great Charge by the good Ma∣nagement
of their Credit; for though it be
true, that they are indebted great Sums of
Money, yet they never want a Supply, nay,
Moneys are often forced upon them by rich
Merchants, who send in their Moneys, and
only take the Admiralties Obligations, with
which they afterward pay their Customs,
when their Ships arrive, at which time the
Admiralty allows them Interest for the time
they have had their Money: And this is it
that makes the Admiralties Obligations more
valued than ready Money, for it saves the
trouble of telling: And such is the Credit
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
of the Admiralty, that when they have oc∣casion
for any Goods, the People strive to
furnish them, and rather take their Obliga∣tions
than Money, because they get Interest;
and all other Assignments upon the Admi∣ralty
are very punctually paid, and without
Exchequer Fees; no they are Sworn Offi∣cers,
who are forbid to receive any Monies
for Fees, being contented with the Sallery
they have of the States. And their methods
used at the Custom-house for loading or un∣loading
Ships are very easie, insomuch, that
the Women generally have the charging and
discharging the Ships at the Custom-house,
which is a great Policy in the States to make
Trade easie for the Encouragement of the
Merchants: And the Admiralty are very
grateful and generous unto their Comman∣ders;
if any of their Admirals, or Captains
are kill'd at Sea, and have done any consi∣derable
Service, they then Eternize their
Memories with lasting Trophies of Honour,
as you may see by those Stately Monuments
of <HI>Trump, Updam, de Ruiter,</HI> the <HI>Eversons,</HI>
and others; nor are they sparing in bestow∣ing
large Gifts and Pensions on the Widows,
and Children of those as have served them
Faithfully and Valiantly in the Wars, whilst
the Treacherous and Cowards meet with the
severity they deserve; I might here in the
next place, inlarge and tell you of the excel∣lent
methods they have in Building, and
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
preserving their Ships when Built, but I shall
refer you to that excellent Peice written by
the <HI>Heer Witsen</HI> on that Subject. And shall
now in the next place say something of their
Famous Company, called the <HI>East-India</HI>
Company of the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> this Company
is said to be a Commonwealth within a
Commonwealth, and it is true, if you consi∣der
the Soveraign Power and Privileges they
have granted them by the States General,
and likewise consider their Riches, and vast
number of Subjects, and the many Territo∣ries
and Colonies they possess in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
they are said to have 30000 Men in
constant Pay, and above 200 Capital Ships,
besides Sloops, Ketches, and Yachts. This
Company hath by their Politick Contrivances,
and Sedulous Industry possessed themselves
of many Colonies formerly belonging unto
the Spaniards, Portuguises, and divers In∣dian
Princes, and as good Christians have
been at great Charge in Planting the Gospel
of Christ in many parts there, Printing in
the Indian Language Bibles, and Prayer
Books, and Catechisms, for the Instruction
of the Indians, maintaining Ministers and
School-masters, to inform those that are
Converted to the Christian Faith: And now,
because I have said that this Company is so
considerable, and as it were a Common∣wealth
apart, I will demonstrate it to be so;
first by their Power, Riches, and Strength
<PB N="35" REF="22"/>
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> secondly, what Figure they
make in <HI>Europe,</HI> and this very briefly, for if
I should speak of every particular, as to
their Possessions in the <HI>Indies,</HI> it would swell
into many Volumes, but I will only begin
with them at the <HI>Cape de bonne Esperance,</HI>
where they have built a Royal Fort, in which
they maintain a Garison of Soldiers to defend
their Ships which come there to take in fresh
Water: From thence let us take a view of
them in the Island of <HI>Java;</HI> where they have
built a fair City called <HI>Battavia,</HI> and Fortified
it with Bastions, after the mode of <HI>Amster∣dam.</HI>
This City is the place of Residence of
their grand Minister of State, called the Ge∣neral
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> he hath allowed him Six
Privy Counsellors in Ordinary, and Two
Extraordinary, these govern the Concerns
of the Company throughout the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
they make Peace and War, send their Am∣bassadors
to all parts thereof, as occasion re∣quireth.
This General hath his Guards of
Horse and Foot, and all sorts of Officers and
Servants, as if he were a Soveraign Prince,
the whole Expence whereof is defrayed out
of the Companies Stock. This General hath
much of the direction of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and other
parts of the Island of <HI>Java:</HI> From whence
let us take a view of them in their great
Possessions in the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, and those
of <HI>Banda,</HI> where they are become so formi∣dable,
that they look as if they aimed at the
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
Soveraignty of the South Seas: They have
also a great Trade in <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> from
whence let us return to the Islands of <HI>Suma∣tra,</HI>
and on the Coast of <HI>Bengale,</HI> where
they have several Lodges: In <HI>Persia</HI> they have
likewise great Commerce, and are so consi∣derable,
that they wage War with that
mighty Monarch if he wrongs them in their
Trade. They also have several Colonies and
Lodges on the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Cor∣mandel,</HI>
and in the Country of the Great
<HI>Mogul,</HI> and King of <HI>Galcanda,</HI> but princi∣pally
let us behold them in the rich Island of
<HI>Zeylon,</HI> where they are Masters of the plain
Country, so that the Emperor, or King of that
Island, is forced to live in the Mountains,
whilst this Company possess the City of <HI>Co∣lomba,</HI>
and other the most considerable Ga∣risons
of that Island: It is said, that the Com∣pany
hath there in their pay 3600 Soldiers,
and at least 300 Guns Planted in their Forts
and Garisons; in a word, they are not only
Masters of the Cinnamon, but of all other
Spices except Pepper, and that they would
also have, had it been for their Interest to
Ingross, but they wisely foresaw that the
English would be a block in their way, there∣fore
they contented themselves to be Masters
of the Mace, Cinnamon, Cloves, and Nut∣megs,
with which they not only serve <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
but many places in the <HI>Indies;</HI> I will
say no more of them in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but let us
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>
see what Figure they make in <HI>Europe.</HI> And
first to begin with them in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
where they have two large stately Palaces,
one being in the old part of the City, and
the other in the new; in that of the old part
of the City they keep their Court, and there
sits the Resident Committee of the Company,
where also they make the Sales of the Com∣panies
Goods. There for six years the grand
Council, or Assembly of the Seventeen, do
meet, and after six years are expired, the
grand Council of the Seventeen do assemble
at <HI>Middelburg</HI> in <HI>Zealand</HI> for two years, and
then again return to <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> the other
lesser Chambers of <HI>Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</HI> and
<HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chuysen</HI> never having the Assembly of the
Seventeen in their Chambers, so that only
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> have the Honour of
that grand Council. I will therefore crave
leave to describe unto you the Chamber of
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> it being the most considerable
of the Chambers belonging to this Famous
Company: In their House or Palace, within
the old City, are many large Offices or A∣partments;
as first, on the lower Floor is
their Parliament Chamber, where the Seven∣teen
do sit; next to this Chamber are seve∣ral
fair Chambers for the Committees to sit
in. They have also a Chamber of Audi∣ence,
where they do receive Princes or Am∣bassadors,
or other great Men as have occa∣sion
to speak with them. In one of these
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>
Chambers are the Arms of several Indian
Princes they have Conquered. On the same
Floor is their Treasury Office, where their
Receivers sit and receive Money, and Pay
out the Orders or Assignments of the Com∣pany;
near to that Chamber sits their grand
Minister, the Heer <HI>Peter van Dam,</HI> who is
said to be a second <HI>John de Wit</HI> for Parts, tho'
not so in Principle: This great Minister is a
Man of indefatagable Industry, and labours
Night and Day in the Companies Service;
he Reads over twice the great Journal Books
which come from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and out of them
makes Minutes to prepare matters of Con∣cern
necessary to be considered by the grand
Council of Seventeen, and by the inferiour
Committees of the Company, and prepares
Instructions and Orders to be sent to their
Chief Ministers in the <HI>Indies;</HI> I could say
many more things of his great Worth and
Virtues, but shall forbear lest I should be
judged a Flatterer: Over-against this great
Ministers Office sit in a Chamber many
Clarks, or under Secretaries, who receive
from this Minister their Orders of Dispatches
in the Affairs of the Company; and next to
this Chamber is a Register Office, where are
kept the Journal Books of the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
you may see the Names of all the Men and
Women that have ever served the Company
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> with the time of their Death,
or departing the Companies Service: Then
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>
next to that is a Council Chamber, where
the Residing Chamber, or Committee of the
Company always sits; then assending up
Stairs, there sit their Book-holders, who keep
the Accounts of all the Transactions of those
that buy or sell Actions of the Company, and
over against this Office sits the <HI>Heer Gerbrand
Elias,</HI> who is the second Advocate of the
Company: On this Floor are several large
Rooms, in which are great Stores of Pack'd
Goods, and also a Room with all sorts of
Drugs, Tea, Wax, Ambergreace, and Musk;
and on the same Floor is a Chamber where
the Commissioners sit, who govern the Pack-houses;
and next to them sit their Clerks,
who keep the Registers of the Sales of the
Companies Goods: And on the same Gal∣lery
or Floor, is a Chamber where are kept
the several Books of Divinity, Printed in the
Indian Language, that are sent to the several
Colonies of the Company: And at the end
of this Gallery is a Magazine full of Medi∣caments
and Instruments for Barber Chirur∣geons
Chests, to furnish the Companies Ships
and Garisons in the <HI>Indies:</HI> Then assending
up another pair of Stairs, there are several
large Magazines of Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace,
and Cinnamon; and in a long Gallery are
many Men at Work sorting of Spices fit for
Sale: Then ascending up another pair of
Stairs there are many Rooms full of Spices;
then descending into the Court-yard, there
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>
is Guard Chamber, where every Night the
House-keeper hath a Watch, and on the o∣ther
side of the Gate there is a Chymist▪ who
with his Men prepares Medicaments for the
<HI>Indies;</HI> adjoyning to this Court-yard is their
Ware-house and Pack-house for Pepper and
Gross Goods; but before I leave this House
in the old part of the City, I must say some∣thing
of the manner or method used in the
Transactions of the Jews and others, who
make a Trade of Buying and Selling the
Actions of the Company, the which is a great
Mystory of Iniquity, and where it inricheth
one Man, it ruins an hundred. The Jews
are the chief in that Trade, and are said to
Negotiate 17 parts of 20 in the Company;
These Actions are bought and sold four times
a day, at 8 in the Morning in the Jews-street,
at a 11 on the Dam, at 12 and at one a
Clock upon the Exchange, and at six in the
Evening on the Dam, and in the Colleges or
Clubs of the Jews until 12 at midnight,
where many times the crafty Jews, and others
have contrived to coin bad News to make
the Actions fall, and good News to raise
them, the which Craft of doing at <HI>Amster∣dam</HI>
is not taken notice of, which is much
to be wondred at, in such a Wise Govern∣ment
as <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is; for it is a certain
Truth, they many times spread Scandalous
Reports touching the Affairs of State, which
pass amongst the Ignorant for Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="25"/>
I shall now in the next place say some∣thing
of their Palace, or Magazine, in the
new part of the City, the which may more
properly be called an Arsenal: It is a Build∣ing
so superb, that it looks more like a Kings
Palace, than a Magazine for Merchants: I
have measured the Ground on which this
Arsenal stands, which I find to be 2000
Foot, and square every way, reckoning the
Motes, or Burgals, about it. I remember
the Ingenious Sir <HI>Joseph Williamson</HI> measured
the two Rope-Alleys, by telling the Stone-Figures
in the Wall, and found them to be
1800 Foot long, the like whereof is not to
be seen in the World. On the backside
of this Rope-Alley lies a store of Five Hun∣dred
large Anchors, besides small ones; in
this Arsenal they build the Ships belonging
to this Chamber: And here are all sorts of
Work-houses for the Artificers that serve the
Company. And in a Chamber next to
the Joyners Office, is a model of a Ship,
they now build their Ships by, which cost
6000 Gilders. When a Man beholds the
great Stores of Timber, Cordage, and the
Provisions of War in their Magazine, a Man
would think there were enough to furnish
a whole Nation: In this Arsenal the Ships
unload their Goods, laid up in several Apart∣ments
in the grand Magazine, and after∣ward
is removed to the House in the old
part of the City, as there is occasion for
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>
Sale. In the upper part of this large Palace
sit the Sail-makers at work; but on the lower
part of this House is an Apartment where
the Committee assemble upon occasion
of Business: This Arsenal is not to be seen
by Strangers without a Ticket from the Be∣winthebbers.
Now all what I have spoken
of these two Houses, or Magazines, doth
only belong unto the Chamber of <HI>Amster∣dam.</HI>
There are yet other Chambers of
the Company, who, according to their Quo∣ta,
or stock in the Company, have the like
Houses and Magazines, as the Chambers of
<HI>Zealand, Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</HI> and <HI>En∣kusen.</HI>
And now I have named the Six
Chambers, of which the Company is com∣posed,
I shall say something of their Con∣stitution,
which is from an Octroy, or Act
of the States-General; by which they have
Sovereign Power over their Servants in the
<HI>Indies,</HI> yea, their Authority reacheth their
Servants in all Territories of the States-Ge∣nerals
Dominions: It is Death for any of the
States Subjects to be Interlopers against this
Company; nor may any, of what Nation
soever, that lives in any of the Companies
Territories, as Burghers or Servants, return
into <HI>Europe</HI> without leave from the Com∣pany,
only those called Freemen may de∣part
without asking leave to remove: The
Grand Councel of this Company is the As∣sembly
of the Seventeen, which are elected
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>
out of the several Chambers before named,
that is, Eight from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and four
from <HI>Zealand; Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</HI> and
<HI>Enkusen,</HI> send one a piece, which makes Six∣teen,
and the five lesser Chambers by turns
chose the Seventeenth. In the Chamber of
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> there are 20 Bewinthebbers, or
Committee for Management of the Stock, in
ordinary, who are for Life, and have 1000
Ducatoons a Year, and Spices at <HI>Christmas,</HI>
and their Travelling Charges, when they go
upon the Companies Service. The next
Chamber is <HI>Zealand,</HI> which hath twelve Be∣winthebbers,
who have about 250 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
and travelling Charges, and Spices at <HI>Christ∣mas.</HI>
The next is <HI>Delft,</HI> which hath Seven
Bewinthebbers, who have only 120 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
and Travelling Charges and Spices at <HI>Christ∣mas.</HI>
The other Chambers of <HI>Rotterdam,
Horne</HI> and <HI>Enkusen,</HI> have seven Bewintheb∣bers
a piece, and the like Salary, with Tra∣velling
Charges and Spices at <HI>Christmas,</HI> as
the Chamber of <HI>Delft</HI> hath. These Bewin∣thebbers
are elected or chosen out of those
<HI>Adventurers</HI> called the High <HI>Participanten</HI> of
the Company: They generally chuse such
as are Rich, and Men of Parts and Wisdom,
most of them being of the Magistracy of the
Country. No Man is capable of being Ele∣cted
a Bewinthebber who hath not 1000 <HI>l.</HI>
Stock in the Company. In a word, this
Grand Council of the Seventeen make Laws
for the Governing the Company, both in
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
<HI>India</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> It is they that appoint the
Days of Sale, and what Number of Ships
each Chamber must send to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and
likewise order the Building of Ships, and all
other grand Concerns. This Company is
worthily esteemed a Wise, Politique, De∣serving
Company, sparing no cost to get
good Intelligence of Affairs, sending Mes∣sengers
and Expresses over-Land to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI>
They have their <HI>Spies</HI> and <HI>Correspon∣dents</HI>
in all the considerable Trading Parts of
the World: They have been so industrious
as to gain the Spice Trade, not only from
the Venetians, Spaniards, Portuguises, French,
Danes, and other European Nations, but
have also Ingrossed all the Spices; so that,
as I told you before, they sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spices to the
Indians themselves: But this I must say for
them, that they are a Generous Company,
and gratefully paying Respects where it is
due, as lately they have Complemented his
Royal Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> His pre∣sent
Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with an An∣nual
Sum out of the Profits of their Compa∣ny,
to make him their Friend and Prote∣ctor.
Neither are they backward in bestow∣ing
Presents upon Strangers that have obli∣ged
them, as I could instance in some of our
own Nation. They are also very charitable
to the Poor, giving them the Thousandth
Gilder of all the Goods they sell. And to
all the Reformed Ministers in <HI>Amsterdam</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
they send Spices at <HI>Christmas,</HI> to pray every
<HI>Sunday</HI> for the Welfare and Prosperity of the
Company. To conclude, this Company is
a Buckler and Defence for the Common∣wealth
upon all urgent Occasions: And tru∣ly
our English <HI>East-India-Company</HI> might be
the same to our King, if the Differences be∣tween
the Two Companies were composed;
especially now they have such a great King
to protect them, and that the Interlopers
are destroyed.</P>
<P>And now it is high time I should tell you
the Methods a Stranger must take if he hath
occasion to keep House in <HI>Amsterdam:</HI> If a
Man will hire an House, he must take a
Lease upon Seal'd Paper, for which you
must pay a Tax to the States, and pay the
Broaker that makes the Bargain: But before
you can buy a House, you must be in a capa∣city
to be made a Burgher. To this purpose it
is usual to take with you to the Stadthouse
your Broaker, or any two Securities, and
there before the Burghermasters take the
Oath of Burgherschap, which is to be faith∣ful
to the City, to the Magistrates and Go∣vernment,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if you buy either Land
or Houses, and lodge▪ privately, you will find
your case much worse; then you must pay
a Legion of Taxes to the Mills that drain
your Lands, and for maintaining the Banks
and Sluces; and if the States have occasion
to build a Fortification on your Lands, or
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>
to drown them in time of War, you must
be contented with the States Terms: And
if your House or Houses stand empty with∣out
Tenants, yet you must pay the States
Taxes on that House or Houses. Thus much
for the Method how you are to be advanced
to be a Burgher of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and to give
you a taste what you are to pay for Houses
or Land, if you settle there; and if you have
either purchased or hired an House, then
comes an Officer from the Stadthouse, with
a Printed Sealed Paper, who tells you, you
must pay as followeth.</P>
<P>First, A Pole-Tax for every Male and Fe∣male
Servant in the House above eight Years
old, six Gilders a Year.</P>
<P>For a Coach, if you keep one, 75 Gil∣ders
a Year.</P>
<P>For a Coach without Wheels, 50 Gilders
a Year.</P>
<P>For Soap, as the Number of the Family
is.</P>
<P>The like for Salt.</P>
<P>For Wine, as your Quality is.</P>
<P>To the Watch, as your House is in Great∣ness.</P>
<P>To the Lanthorns, as the largeness of the
House is.</P>
<P>For Butter, every 20 Pound seven Sti∣vers.</P>
<P>For Beans, half as much as you pay for
the Beans.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="28"/>
For Turff, every Tun five Stivers.</P>
<P>For every 20 Gilders in Wood, six Gil∣ders.</P>
<P>For Flesh the Tax often changeth.</P>
<P>There is also a Tax on the Bread.</P>
<P>Then there is a Tax called the 200th
Penny, and a Tax called the 8th: Then
there are many Taxes in Trade, as that no
Man can weigh or measure out his own
Goods if sold in gross, but the States Offi∣cers
must do it. Then the States have a Tax
called the <HI>Verpounding</HI> on all Lands and Hou∣ses
in their Dominions. Then they have a
Tax on Seal'd Paper, and a Tax for Regi∣stering
Land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Houses; likewise a Tax on
Cows, Horse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Calves, and on all sort of
Fruit. There are many other Taxes I could
name, as a Stiver for every Man that goes
out or into any City after the Hour of shut∣ting
the Gates. Also you pay for going
over some Bridges, and passing through
Gates called <HI>Tolhek,</HI> a Stiver for every Per∣son;
but Coaches, Wagons or Horses pay
more. These I have already named, you
will say, are too many; yet I may not for∣get
to tell you, that Milk first pays as Milk;
and again if it be made Butter; yea, the
Buttermilk and Whay pays a Tax likewise,
for all which a Man would think that a Peo∣ple
that stand so much upon maintaining of
their Liberty should Mutiny, and refuse pay∣ment:
But this seldom happens; and if it
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>
doth, the States punish them very severely.
I remember that in my time there was a
Mutiny at <HI>Sardam</HI> about paying a new Tax,
whereupon the States sent a Regiment of
their Souldiers, and seized the Heads of the
Mutineers, and hanged up five or six of them
at the Towns end, and severely whipt eight
under the Gallows. And in the rich City
of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> if any refuse to pay their Tax,
the Magistrates send their Officer to pull off
their Doors; and if they remain long ob∣stinate,
they send and fetch away the lower
Windows of their House, and they dare not
put up others, until they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id the Taxes.
However, this is observable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if any Man
will swear he is not worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he is taxed
at, then he is free: But there are many so
proud, that they will not let the World
know their Condition. I knew a Merchant
named <HI>Ornia,</HI> who paid during the War for
his 200th Penny, and other Taxes for his
and his Wives Children, (having had two
Rich Wives) 14000 Pounds Sterling. I al∣so
knew an English Anabaptist Merchant,
who told the English Envoy in my pre∣sence,
That he had paid near 4000 <HI>l.</HI> Ster∣ling
to the War, and yet the same Man did
Grumble to pay his Majesties Consul a pity∣ful
Fee or Consulat-Money on his Ships:
The reason whereof I once asked him, who
answered me, That the King could not raise
a Penny in <HI>England</HI> without his Parliament,
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
and therefore much less could he do it in the
States Country. Thus these Phanaticks had
rather make Bricks without Straw, than pay
the least Tribute to their Natural Prince's
Officer. Should we in <HI>England</HI> be obliged
to pay the Taxes that are here imposed,
there would be Rebellion upon Rebellion:
And yet after all that is here paid, no Man
may bake his own Bread, or grind his own
Corn, or brew his Beer, nor dare any Man
keep in his House a Hand-Mill, although it
be but to grind Mustard or Coffee. I re∣member
one Mrs. <HI>Guyn</HI> a Coffee-Woman at
<HI>Rotterdam,</HI> had like to have been ruined for
grinding her own Coffee, had not Sir <HI>Lyonel
Jenkins</HI> employed his Secretary Doctor <HI>Wyn</HI>
to intreat the States on her behalf; and it
was reckoned a grand favour that she was
only fined, and not banished the City, and
forfeiture made of all her Goods. I remem∣ber
also a Landlord of mine in <HI>Leyden</HI> bought
a live Pig in the Market, and innocently
brought it home, and kill'd it, for which he
had like to have been ruined, because he did
not first send to the Excisemen to excise it,
and also let the Visitors see that the Pig was
free from Diseases. At another time a Wine-Merchant
coming to give me a Visit, told me
that he had the rarest Rhenish in the City,
and that if I would send my Maid to his Cel∣lar
with six Bottles, they should be fill'd:
Whereupon I sent the Maid only with two
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
Bottles, and charged her to hide them un∣der
her Apron▪ but such was her misfor∣tune,
that the Scouts Dienaers met her, and
seized her and her Bottles, and carried her
to Prison, which cost the Wine-Merchant
1500 Gilders; and had it not been for the
strongest Sollicitations made by us, he had
been ruined: So sacred are Taxes here, and
must so exactly be paid. And were they
not here so precise, it were impossible for
so small a Country to subsist: And therefore
you may hear the Inhabitants generally say,
that what they suffer is for their <HI>Vaderland:</HI>
Hence the meanest among them are content
to pay what is laid on them, for they say all
what is the <HI>Vaderlands</HI> is ours, the Men of
War are theirs, the sumptuous Magazins,
Bridges, and every thing what is the <HI>Vader∣lands.</HI>
And indeed in a sense it is so, for
they have this to comfort them, that if it
please God to visit them with Poverty, they
and their Children have the Publick Purse
to maintain them; and this is one main Reason
why they so willingly pay their Taxes as they
do; for there's not a Soul born in the States
Dominions that wants warm Cloaths and
Dyet, and good Lodging, if they make their
case known to the Magistrates. And for the
Vagabonds that rove up and down the
Streets, they are either Walloons, or other
Strangers as pretend to have been ruined by
the late Wars.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="30"/>
I shall now in the next place let you
know how excellently the Laws are here
executed against Fraud and Perjury, and
the Intention of Murders; which Laws were
once much used in <HI>England,</HI> as you shall
hear hereafter when I speak of the Duke of
<HI>Brandenburgh</HI>'s Court.</P>
<P>I shall here instance a few particulars that
happened in my time: There was a Spark
that made false Assignments on the Admi∣ralty,
who tho' related to many of the Ma∣gistrates
of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> had his Head cut off;
and another who was a Clerk in the Mer∣chants
Bank, who made false Posts in their
Books, and had his Head also cut off; and all
the Portions he had given with his Daughters,
the Husbands were forced to pay back, and
all his Houses and Goods were sold at his
Door in the open Streets: I knew a French
Marquis, who swore his Regiment was com∣pleat,
and when the States knew that he had
not half his Regiment, he likewise had his
Head cut off in the Prison in the <HI>Hague:</HI> I
also knew a French Pedagogue, a Runagado
Monk, who designed to have Murdered his
Master Major <HI>Cavellio,</HI> and his two Pupils,
young Children of the Majors, and after∣ward
to set the House a Fire to colour the
Murder, he had his Head cut off and set
upon a Post, with his Body on a Wheel near
the <HI>Hague.</HI> I could Name you two other
Cheaters, who were severely whipt under
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>
the Gallows; and two under Farmers who
designed to run away with the States Money.</P>
<P>The Cheat of breaking with a full Hand
is not so frequent in <HI>Holland</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI>
(where some use it as a way to slip out of
Business, and then to live conveniently after∣ward
upon the Estates of other Men) be∣cause
in <HI>Holland</HI> they are more severely pu∣nished
when discovered than in <HI>England:</HI>
As on the contrary, those that fall to decay
through Losses, and unavoidable Accidents
which they could not prevent, find a more
speedy and easie way of Compounding and
Finishing Matters with their Creditors if they
be over-strict, than the Custom or Law
of <HI>England</HI> doth afford, for the suing out of
Statutes of Bankrupts in <HI>England</HI> doth prove
many times so pernicious both to Creditor
and Debtor through the tediousness of the
Proceedings, and the expensiveness of Exe∣cuting
the Commissions, that what by Com∣missioners
Fees, Treats, and other incident
Charges, the Creditors are put to such Ex∣pences
as to be utterly disappointed of their
Debt, and the Poor Debtors for ever ruined
and undone; I shall therefore in this place
give a short Relation of the method used in
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> in the case of Bankrupts, which
perhaps may be taken notice of by our King
and Parliament, for the preventing Disor∣ders
and sad Abuses that daily happen in
Executing the Statutes of Bankrupts: The
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
Magistrates of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> every year Name
Commissioners for Bankrupts, out of those
that make up a Judicature, like to our Courts
of Aldermen in <HI>London;</HI> These meet certain
days in the Week in a distinct Chamber in
the Stadthouse, over whose Door is cut in
Marble the Emblem of Fortune flying away
with Wings, and round Chests turn'd upside
down, with Mice and Rats Eating the Mo∣ney-Bags,
Pens, Inkhorns, and Paper-Books.
There they receive Petitions from Debtors
and Creditors, and as occasion requireth,
summon the Parties to appear before them,
and to lay open the true State of the matter;
this done, they either by Authority seize the
Bankrupts Books and Effects, or else without
any stir and noise leave all remaining in the
Debtors Houses, and send thither two Com∣mittees
to examine the Books, and make an
Inventory of the Estate, with power to com∣pose
the matter, without giving much trou∣ble
to the Parties. If the Commissioners
find that the Debtor is come to decay by
unexpected Losses, and unavoidable Acci∣dents,
to which he did not at all contribute,
it is their usual way to propose to the Cre∣ditor
such amicable and easie Terms, as the
Poor Man may be able to perform, alotting
sometimes the half of the Estate left to the
Debtor, sometimes a third part, and some∣times
perswading the Creditors to advance
to the Poor Man a Sum of Money to help
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>
him up again in Trade, upon Condition that
he do oblige himself to pay the Creditors all
he oweth them, when God shall be pleased
to make him able; but on the contrary, if
the Commissioners find that a Trader hath
dealt Knavishly, and broken with a design to
Defraud and Cheat his Creditors, as if it ap∣pear
that a Bankrupt hath kept false Books,
and counterfeited Bills of Exchange, Bills of
Loading, or pretended Commissions from
Foreign Parts; in such a case they are very
severe, and not only seize all the Books and
Effects of the Bankrupt, but also Imprison
him, and also punish him Corporally; and
if the cheat be of an heinous Nature, Sen∣tence
him sometime to Death; whereas, if
the Debtor be only Unfortunate, and no ways
Knavish, then the Commissaries use all the
Power they have to force the Creditors to
accept the Poor Mans Terms, the which is
better for the Creditors than to use the ri∣gour
of the Law, in committing the Poor
Man to Prison, seeing in that case the Cre∣ditors
must maintain him in Prison according
to his Quality, where if he lies a certain time,
and the Creditors be not able to prove the
Prisoner hath an Estate, then the Debtor is
admitted to his Oath to Swear he is not worth
40 Gilders, besides his wearing Cloths and
working Tools, and then he is set at liberty;
but in the mean time let the Prisoner have a
care not to make a false Oath, for then he is
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
punished without Mercy, an instance of
which happened in my time.</P>
<P>The States having admitted a certain Jew
to come and make such an Oath before them,
were at the same time informed by the Goaler,
that this Jew had been seen through the
chinks of the Door, quilting Ducats of Gold,
and some Diamonds in his Cloaths, to the
value of 5000 Gilders. The States hereupon
admonished the Jew to take heed to what
he was about to Swear, because the Law was
very strict against such as made false Oaths
before them, and at the same time caused
the Oath, and the Law to be Read unto
him; nevertheless the Jew offered to take
the Oath, but the Lords not suffering him to
Swear, because then he must die by Law,
caused him to be taken out into another
Room and searched, where they found a∣bout
him the Ducats and Diamonds: This
being told the Lords, they sent for him in,
and then Sentenced him to have 60 Lashes
under the Gallows, and to be Banished the
Country; yet, because the Jew had many
Children, they gave the third part of what
was taken about him to his Wife and Chil∣dren,
and a third to the Poor, and the other
third to the Creditors, which was enough
to pay them their Debt: These Commissio∣ners
are paid by the States, and have not a
Doit from Debtors or Creditors, for all what
they do: These Commissioners are also
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>
much to be commended for their readiness
to do good Offices to those Poor Merchants,
who having lived honestly, are brought to
decay by Losses and Crosses in their Trade;
who when they find any such so Poor that
they can neither pay their Creditors, nor
maintain the charge of their Families, it is
their constant Custom, to take their Chil∣dren
from them, and maintain and bring
them up in their Hospitals; yea, often also
solliciting the Burghermasters on their be∣half,
to bestow some small Office upon them
for their Relief and Subsistance. And here
I must not omit to acquaint you, that as the
Compounding of Matters in <HI>Holland</HI> betwixt
Debtor and Creditor, so as hath been said, is
very easie and equitable, so is also their way
or method of suing for Debts very favorable,
which is after this manner; In the first place,
a Note or Summons is left at the Debtors
House, and if he neglect to appear, a second
Summons is sent, but then if he neither ap∣pear
himself, or send his Proctor, the Sheriffs
order an Arrest against him; and at last,
when he is brought before them, if the matter
be difficult, it is referred to two or three
good Men of the City, and time given him;
but if the Plaintiff make Oath, that he ap∣prehends
the Debtor hath a design to run a∣way,
then must the Prisoner either give Bail,
or return to Prison. It is a Remark that I
have made in my Travels, that excepting
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> I never saw in any Pri∣son
above forty Prisoners for Debt at one
time, and in some great Towns, as in <HI>Haer∣lem</HI>
and others, sometimes not one; and the
Reason hereof is plain, for you cannot lay a
Man in Prison for an Action or Debt, small
or great, but you must maintain the Prisoner,
so that many times the Charges exceed the
principal Debt, and after all, the Prisoner
can free himself; whereas the Custom in
<HI>England,</HI> encouraged by those Varlets the
Pettyfoggers and Catchpoles, of turning a
Man into a Prison for a Crown, or it may
be for nothing at all, if he cannot find Bail,
he may lie and Starve there, is an abomina∣ble
abuse; as also that of Suborning false
Witnesses, which is extreamly cried out a∣gainst
beyond Sea.</P>
<P>And now because I am Speaking of Petty∣foggers,
give me leave to tell you a Story I
met with when I lived in <HI>Rome,</HI> going with
a Roman to see some Antiquities, he shewed
me a Chapel, Dedicated to one St. <HI>Evona,</HI> a
Lawyer of <HI>Britain,</HI> who he said came to <HI>Rome</HI>
to intreat the Pope to give the Lawyers of
<HI>Britain</HI> a Patron, to which the Pope replied,
That he knew of no Saint but what was dis∣posed
of to other Professions; at which <HI>Evona</HI>
was very sad, and earnestly beg'd of the Pope
to think of one for them: At last, the Pope
proposed to St. <HI>Evona,</HI> that he should go
round the Church of St. <HI>John de Latera</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
Blindfold, and after he had said so many <HI>Ave
Maria</HI>'s, that the first Saint he laid hold of
should be his Patron, which the good old
Lawyer willingly undertook; and at the end
of his <HI>Ave Maria</HI>'s, he stopt at St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s
Altar, where he laid hold of the Devil under
St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Feet, and cry'd out, This is our
Saint, let him be our Patron; so being un∣blindfolded,
and seeing what a Patron he had
chosen, he went to his Lodgings so dejected,
that in few Months after he Died, and com∣ing
to Heavens Gates, knockt hard; where∣upon
St. <HI>Peter</HI> asked, Who it was that knockt
so boldly, he replied, That he was St. <HI>Evona</HI>
the Advocate: Away, away, said St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
here is but one Advocate in Heaven, here
is no room for you Lawyers. O but, said St.
<HI>Evona,</HI> I am that honest Lawyer who never
took Fees on both sides, or ever pleaded in
a bad Cause; nor did I ever set my Neigh∣bours
together by the Ears, or lived by the
Sins of the People. Well then, said St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
come in: This news coming down to <HI>Rome,</HI>
a witty Poet writ upon St. <HI>Evona</HI>'s Tomb
these words; St. <HI>Evona un Briton, Advocat
non Larron, Hallelujah.</HI> This Story put me
in mind of <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI>'s going through a
Chruch in <HI>Surrey,</HI> seeing Poor People weep∣ing
over a Grave, asked one of the Women,
Why they wept? O said she, we have lost
our precious Lawyer, Justice <HI>Randal,</HI> he kept
us all in Peace, and always was so good as
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
to keep us from going to Law, the best Man
that ever lived, Well, said <HI>Ben. Johnson,</HI> I will
send you an Epitaph to write upon his Tomb,
which was,</P>
<Q><L>God works Wonders now and than,</L>
<L>Here lies a Lawyer an honest Men.</L></Q>
<P>And truly old <HI>Ben.</HI> was in the right, for in
my time I have observed some Gentlemen of
that Profession, that have not acted like
St. <HI>Evona,</HI> or Justice <HI>Randal,</HI> I will say no
more of them, but wish them as great Fees,
and as much encouragement as the Lawyers
have in <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>I now come to Speak something of the
three Taxes I mentioned in the former part
of my Remarks on Taxes, of which the first
ought rather to be called an useful and pub∣lick
Invention, like to that of the Insurance
Office in <HI>London,</HI> then a publick Tax, seeing
no Man needs contribute to it unless they
please, and find his profit by it; but the o∣ther
may be called Taxes, because the Sub∣jects
are obliged to submit to them, but then
they are so easie, that what the publick gets
thereby, not only lessons extraordinary Sub∣sidies,
which many times occasions clamour,
when because of their Rarity, and the ur∣gency
of Occasions, they must needs be
great.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="35"/>
Yet it is sufficiently Compensated by the
advantage and security in the Estates, which
private Persons, who are obliged to pay it,
reap thereby daily: I am confident, that if
the King and Parliament thought fit to intro∣duce
some, or all three of these Taxes into
<HI>England,</HI> the publick charge of Government
might be defrayed with more ease, and with
less repining and clamour, than when it must
be done by new and high Impositions; how∣ever,
our Governors are the proper Judges of
that.</P>
<P>The first then is an House called the
Merchants Bank, which is governed by di∣vers
Commissioners, Clerks, and Book∣keepers,
likewise an Essay-Master, who judgeth
of the Gold and Silver, that at any time is
brought into the Bank uncoined: The secu∣rity
given for preservation thereof, are the
States and Magistrates of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> Now
if you have a mind to put Money into the
Bank, suppose 1000 <HI>l.</HI> less or more, you
must go to the Clerks, and ask a Folio for
your Name, and then pay in your Money
at three or four <HI>per Cent.</HI> according as the rate
of the Bank-Money is high or low, or you
may buy it of those called Cashiers or Brokers;
then get the Clerks to set down in the Folio
what you bring in; having done so, you may
draw this Sum, or sell it in what parcels you
please; but then if you let your Money lie
seven years in the Bank, you receive no Interest
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
for the same. If you ask, Where then is the
Advantage for the Merchants? I answer, first,
you have your Money ready at all times for
answering Bills of Exchange, and making other
Payments: You are at no charge for Bags or
Portage, at no loss by false tale, or bad Mo∣ney,
in no danger of Thieves, or unfaithful
Servants, or Fire; and above all, you have
the Accounts of your Cash most punctually
and justly kept without any trouble, or run∣ning
the risk of Goldsmith or Cashierers
breaking in your Debt; for such is their
care; that twice a Year, or sometimes oft∣ner,
they shut up the Bank for 14 Days, and
then all that have Concerns therein, must
bring in their Accounts to the Clerks, who
a few Days after, having viewed the Books,
acquaint such as have brought in wrong Ac∣counts
with their Mistakes, desiring them
to return to their Books, and rectifie their
Error, not telling them wherein the mistake
lies: So that I have known Merchants, in
my time, sent back three or four times with
their wrong Accounts: But if they begin to
grow impatient, and say that they will stand
to their Accounts, then they pay a Mulct to
the Clerks upon their convincing them of
their Mistakes, either by charging too much
upon the Bank, or forgetting or omitting
what was their due. I knew two Merchants,
who having forgot, the one 750 <HI>l.</HI> and the
other 220 <HI>l.</HI> in their Accounts, were honest∣ly
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
rectified by the Clerks, so that they su∣stained
no Loss. Besides this care of the
Clerks in keeping and stating the Accounts,
the Bank is obliged for 5 <HI>l.</HI> a Year to send
to every Merchant that desires it, their Ac∣counts
every Morning before Exchange∣time,
of the Moneys written of by them in
in the Bank the Day before upon any Mer∣chants
Account, and what Sums are written
of by others upon their Accounts: So that
the Merchants may compare the Banks.
Notes with their Books, and so save much
of the Charges of Book-keeping.</P>
<P>Now if it be objected, That though this
be an Advantage to the Merchants, yet what
can the Publick gain thereby, seeing the
Charges of paying Officers, Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
must needs be very considerable?</P>
<P>I answer, That indeed it is a Mystery to
those who understand not the thing; but if
it were once known and practised, the Ad∣vantage
of it would appear: For among o∣ther
things which might be said, the Magi∣strates
of the City take out of the Merchants
Bank a sufficient Stock of Money to supply
the Lumbert, a Bank that lends out Money,
and is Governed by four Commissioners cho∣sen
out of the Magistrates, who sit in Court
every Day in the Lumbert, which is a large
Pile of Building 300 Foot long, containing
several Chambers and Magazines under one
Roof; in these several Chambers the Com∣missioners
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
have Officers sitting to lend Money
upon all sorts of Goods, even from a pair of
Shooes to the richest Jewel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is a
great convenience for Poor People; yea,
for Merchants also, who some times may
want Money to pay a Bill of Exchange, and
prevents the Cheating, and extraordinary
Extortion used by the Pawn-brokers in <HI>Eng∣land,
France,</HI> and other Countries. And be∣sides,
the Poor have their Pawns safely and
well preserved, neither are they punctually
sold when the Year is out, or denied under the
pretext of being mislaid, as the Poor are often
times served by the wicked Pawn-brokers.</P>
<P>There is also another convenience in this
Lumbert, <HI>viz.</HI> an excellent way they have of
discovering Thieves, and the stolen Goods;
they publish two general open Sales of Goods
pawn'd, twice a year, that such as will may
redeem their Goods, and paying the Inte∣rest
may have them, although the time be
relapsed. Thus much as to the <HI>Lumbert.</HI> I
was once, according to my Duty, to wait
upon the D. of <HI>York,</HI> at the Bank of Mer∣chants,
where shewing his Highness the way
of keeping the Journal-Book of the Bank,
which is of a prodigious bigness, his Highness
was extreamly pleased with the contrivance of
preserving it from Fire; saying, that the
course they took might be of great use for
the preserving Patents, and the Deeds of
Noblemens Estates: This contrivance, which
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
perhaps may be thought useful or imitable, I
shall therefore describe it: It is a large Fire∣stone
shaped like a Chest, and set upright in
a Stone-Wall, having a large Brass Door of
a vast thickness, with Flaps to fall over and
cover the Lock and Hinges; into this Chest
the Book is drawn upon Rolls, it being of
such a bulk and weight as cannot be handed
in by a Man, and there it is so securely
preserved, that although the House should
be burnt, the Book in all probability would
be safe. Should I here give an account of
the vast Sums of Money that daily are writ∣ten
of in this Bank, I might probably be
thought to speak at random, but this I may
boldly affirm, that it far exceeds all the Banks
in <HI>Europe,</HI> both for Riches and Business, and
their Credit is such, that the Italians, French,
Germans, and English have great Sums in
the same; neither was ever any Man refused
his Money in the worst of times.</P>
<P>A second Tax is what ariseth from the just
and laudable Establishment of a Register, a
Tax which I think most Men will be willing
to submit to, except such as design to cheat
and defraud their Neighbours, and live by
such like Sins and Confusion, and for the
most part die with the Curse of the People:
This Register in <HI>Holland</HI> begets such assu∣rance
and safety in Dealing, that in purcha∣sing
of Houses or Land, a Child, though
over-reached in the Value, yet cannot be
cheated as to the Title.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="37"/>
The Third and last Tax is that of Sealed
Paper, as it is practised in <HI>Holland.</HI> There
are many other things might be spoken, as
to the Government of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> but I must
not tire your patience. However, one con∣siderable
thing I would not pass by, touching
the Militia: There are in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> Sixty
Companies of Foot, the least of them having
200 Men, some 300, which in a modest
account, amounts at least to 15000 Men, in
which number neither Jews nor Anabaptists
who carry no Arms are reckoned, only they
are obliged to contribute to the maintenance
of the 1400 Soldiers, who are kept in con∣stant
pay, as a Guard for the City, and to∣wards
the Night-Watch or Rattel-Watch,
who walk the Streets the whole Night to
keep good Orders, and tell us every half
hour what a Clock it is. There are also up∣on
every Church Tower, Trumpeters, who
Sound every half hour; and if any Fire
breaks out in the City, they give a Signal on
which side of the City the Fire is, and Ring
the Fire-Bell; and they have excellent ways
on a sudden in such sad Accidents to quench
Fire: But I may not inlarge any longer, but
hasten out of <HI>Holland.</HI> Though before I leave it
it will not be amiss if I give the Reader a List
of the Passage-Boats, which for the conveni∣ence
of those that Travel that way, I have here
Collected, with the times of their going off,
which they are punctual in observing.</P>

Hand, and be content to take your place af∣ter
those that go quite out.</P>
<P>And now having said so much of the States
Government, and of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in particu∣lar,
it will not be amiss to take notice of some
bad Customs and Practices now in vogue in
<HI>Holland,</HI> and leave it to the Reader to judge
what they may portend: There are Tolle∣rated
in the City of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> amongst
other abuses, at least 50 Musick-houses, where
lewd Persons of both Sexes meet and pra∣ctise
their Villanies: There is also a place
called the Long-Seller, a Tollerated Exchange,
or publick Meeting House for Whores and
Rogues to Rendezvous in, and make their
filthy Bargains. This Exchange is open from
six a Clock in the Evening until nine at Night;
every Whore must pay three Stivers at the
Door for her Entrance or Admission. I
confess the Ministers Preach and exclaim
from the Pulpit against this horrible Abuse,
but who they be that protect them I know
not; yet, I have heard some plead for the
Tolleration of these wicked Meetings, upon
pretext, that when the <HI>East-India</HI> Fleets
come home, the Seamen are so mad for
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>
Women, that if they had not such Houses
to bait in, they would force the very Citi∣zens
Wives and Daughters; but it is well
known, that as Money does countenance, so
Discipline might suppress that abuse. The
old severe, and frugal way of living is now
almost quite out of date in <HI>Holland,</HI> there is
very little to be seen of that sober Modesty
in Apparel, Diet, and Habitations as for∣merly:
In stead of convenient Dwellings,
the Hollanders now build stately Palaces,
have their delightful Gardens, and Houses of
Pleasure, keep Coaches, Wagons and Sleas,
have very rich Furniture for their Horses,
with Trappings adorned with Silver Bells. I
have seen the Vanity of a Vintners Son, who
had the Bosses of the Bit, and Trapping of
his Horse of pure Silver; his Toot-Man and
Coach-Man having Silver Fring'd Gloves;
yea, so much is the humour of the Women
altered, and of their Children also, that no
Apparel can now serve them but the best and
richest that <HI>France</HI> and other Countries af∣fords;
and their Sons are so much addicted
to Play, that many Families in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> are
ruined by it; not that <HI>England</HI> is less extra∣vagant
then the Dutch; who as I said be∣fore,
got such great Estates by their Frugality,
whilst they were not addicted to such Pro∣digality
and Wantonness as the English are,
whose excess I cannot excuse; nevertheless,
the grave and sober People of <HI>Holland</HI> are
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>
very sensible of the great alteration that now
is in their Country, and as they say, <HI>Para∣celsus</HI>
used to Cure his Patients of their Dis∣ease
with a full Belly; so a good Burgher∣master
desirous to convince his Amsterdam∣mers
of their dissolute kind of Life, invited
the 36 Magistrates and their Wives to a Feast;
who being come, and the Ladies big with
Expectation of some rare and extraordinary
Entertainment, sat down at Table, where
the first Course was Buttermilk boil'd with
Apples, Stock-fish, Butter'd Turnips and
Carrots, Lettice, Sallat, and Red Herrings,
and only small Bear, without any Wine;
at this the Ladies startled, and began to
whisper to their Husbands, that they expe∣cted
no such Entertainment, but upon re∣moving
of the Dishes and Plates, they found
underneath Printed Verses, importing, That
after that manner of living they began to
thrive, and had inlarged their City.</P>
<P>The Second Course consisted of Bocke de
kooks, Quarters of Lamb, Roasted Rabbits,
and a sort of Pudding they call a <HI>Brother;</HI>
here they had <HI>Dort</HI> and English Beer, with
French Wine, yet all this did not please the
Dainty Dames: But upon removing away
the Plates another Dish of Poetry appeared,
which acquainted them, That after that mo∣dest
and sober way of living they might keep
what they had got, and lay up something for
their Children.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="41"/>
Then comes in the Third Course made
up of all the Rarities of the Season, as Par∣tridges,
Pheasants, and all sorts of Fowl,
and English Pasties, with plenty of Rhenish,
and other sorts of Wine, to moisten them;
this put the Ladies in a Frolick, and jolly
Humour, but under their Plates was found
the Use and Application in Verses, telling
them, That to feed after that manner was
Voluptuous and Luxurious, and would impair
their Health, and waste their Estates, make
them neglect their Trade, and so in time re∣duce
their stately and new built flourishing
City to their old Fishing Town again. Af∣ter
this was brought in a Banquet of all sorts
of Sweat Meats piled up in Pyramids, and
delicate Fruit, with plenty of delicious Wines;
and to conclude all, a set of Musick and
Maskers, who Danced with the young La∣dies;
but at parting, like the hand writing
to <HI>Belteshazzar</HI> upon the Wall, every one had
a Printed Paper of Moralities put into their
Hand, shewing them the Causes of the Ruin
of the Roman Commonwealth, according
to that of the Poet,
<Q><L>Nullum crimen abest, facinusque libidinis
ex quo,</L>
<L>Paupertas Romana perit.</L></Q>
with an excellent Advice to them, That if
they did not quit the Buffoonries, and Apish
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
Modes of the French, and return to the Sim∣plicity,
Plainness and Modesty of their An∣cestors
and Founders, their Commonwealth
could not long last; but all the Thanks the
good old Burghermaster had for his kind and
chargeable Entertainment in thus Feasting
his Country-Men, was to be Floutted at, and
Pasquild, the Sparks of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> saying in
all places, That the old Man being now past
the years of Pleasure himself, would have
none others to take theirs: And here I shall
put a period to what I thought fit to observe
of the States of the United Provinces, only I
will beg leave to say something to the Hol∣lander
by way of Advice, <HI>viz.</HI> That now
they are in a prosperous Condition, Rich,
and at Ease, they would look back and remem∣ber
what God in his infinite Goodness and
Mercy did for them in the days of their
greatest Calamities: For my own part I can∣not
but admire the great Providence of God
in preserving them from being devoured by
their many Enemies they had in the last War,
besides their Enemies at home, some of which
particulars as they then happened give me
leave to relate. At the time when the French
came to Invade the Territories of the States
General, it then looked as if God had mark'd
out the way for the French to March, by
sending such a wonderful dry Season, that
the Rivers of the <HI>Rhine, Beta, Wall,</HI> and
other Rivers were Fordable, so that the
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>
French only waded throw, and became so
Victorious, that in a little space of time
(what by the Treasons of some, and the
Ignorance and Cowardise of others intrusted
with the Militia and Garisons) the French
became Masters of above Forty Cities and
Garisons, at which time there was nothing
to be heard of in the States Dominions but
Confusion and Misery, even in the strong
and rich City of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> it self, who at
this time beheld the French Army like a mighty
Torrent coming within sight of the City,
and at the same time wanting Water in their
Canals, and Burghwalls to ply their Sluces,
and such was the scarcity of Rain, that a
Pail of fresh Water was worth Six Pence:
Thus Heaven seemed to frown on them, as
well as the French Army, by the shutting
up as it were the Conduits of Heaven, and
yet a worse thing had like to have fallen
out, for at the same time the Divisions
grew so high amongst the Magistrates
in the Stadthouse, that it was putting to
the Question, Whether or no they should
not go and meet the French King with
the Keys of their City, to save it from Fire
and Plunder; now nothing, in all probabi∣lity,
could save this rich City from falling
into the hands of the French, but an imme∣diate
hand from Heaven, and it had un∣doubtedly
come to pass, had not Providence
caused the French to make a stand at <HI>Muy∣den,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>
two hours from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> at what
time the valiant Roman of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
Scout <HI>Hasselaer,</HI> like a true Father of his Coun∣try,
opposed the French Party in the Coun∣sel,
calling out to the Burghers from the
Stadthouse, to take Courage, and rather
chuse to die, like old Battavians, with their
Swords in their hands, than tamely and
treacherously to yield up their City to the
Mercy of the French, as some of the Ma∣gistrates
were about to do; this so incoura∣ged
the Burghers, that with great Courage
they mann'd the Walls, and Heaven then
assisting them with a sudden and plentiful
Rain, that they ply'd their Sluces, and
dround the Lands round the City three or
four Foot high, in some places, which caus'd
the victorious French Army to make a quick
retreat, as far as <HI>Utrecht,</HI> else they had paid
dear for seeing of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> thus was
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> delivered by the hand of
Heaven.</P>
<P>A Second was, when that bloody Duke
of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> who gloried and thanked
GOD that he was born without pity or re∣morse
of Conscience, took the opportunity
of an exceeding hard Frost, to march his
Army over the Ice as it had been dry ground,
burning in his way the three fair Villages of
<HI>Bodygrave, Swammerdam,</HI> and <HI>Goudse-sluys;</HI>
acting there a more cruel Tragedy, and
worse, than ever did Turk, for they gene∣rally
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
save the Country People for Ransom,
but this cruel Prince caused strong Guards
to surround the Villages, and burnt Men,
Women, and Children together: Thus he
began his march, with a design to burn <HI>Ley∣den,
Hague, Rotterdam, Delft,</HI> and all the rich
Country of <HI>Rhineland:</HI> And this he might
have done in all probability, for, first, the
Governor of <HI>New-sluce,</HI> who commanded
the Post that should have stopt the French,
treacherously delivered up the Fort without
firing a Gun; and the handful of Troops
then under General <HI>Koningsmark</HI> were so in∣considerable,
that they, joyned to the Sol∣diers
under <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Vin,</HI> the Governor of
<HI>New-sluce,</HI> were not able to make head as
could oppose <HI>Laxemburg</HI>'s Army; and at the
same time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was with
the States Army at <HI>Charleroy:</HI> Now was <HI>Ley∣den</HI>
ready to meet the French with the Keys
of their City, and other Cities too, for they
had neither Fortifications nor Soldiers to
man their Walls: Thus the whole Country
and Cities of <HI>Rhineland</HI> were like to fall un∣der
the Cruelties and Tyrany of the French,
but GOD a second time sent these People
Relief from Heaven, first by giving such un∣daunted
Courage to that Great States-man
Pensionary <HI>Fagel,</HI> that he forced <HI>Coningsmark</HI>
to rally his Troops together, and to make
a stand near <HI>Leyden,</HI> offering himself to die
at the head of them if there were occasion,
<PB N="78" REF="44"/>
but GOD reserved him for a further Good
to the Commonwealth, by sending such a
sudden Thaw as was never seen before, for
in less than ten hours, the Ice so sunk, and
such Floods of Snow came down from the
Highlands, that the French were fain to
make a very disorderly retreat, marching up
to the middle for haste, because on the Banks
there could not march above four Men
a-breast, so they were constrained to leave
behind them the greatest part of the Plun∣der
they had robb'd from the Innocent Coun∣try
People, and the nimble Dutch-men, on
their Scates, so long as the Ice would bear
them, did shoot down the French like Ducks
diving under Water, so that it cost <HI>Luxem∣burg</HI>'s
Army dear, though they had the
pleasure to burn the poor People, of which
the French afterward wickedly made their
boast.</P>
<P>The third was as wonderful as the two
others; and although I do not believe Mira∣cles,
as do the Papists, yet I say nothing I
ever observed looked more like a Miracle
than this; to wit, when the English and
French Fleet lay before <HI>Scheveling</HI> with a de∣sign
to land, and the French ready on their
March to joyn with the English and other
French as soon as they should land, at the
same time the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> lying before
<HI>Groeningen,</HI> and the French before <HI>Gorcom,</HI> so
that now all things looked with a dreadful
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
face for the States, yet at this very time God
sent a third relief, by sending such Mists,
and wonderful sorts of Tydes, as so separa∣ted
the two Fleets, that the English were
forced to quit <HI>Scheveling</HI> Shore, and were
driven on the side of the <HI>Texel</HI> Road; from
whence they were constrained by the season
of the Year to retire home: And such were
the sudden and great Showers of Rain, that
the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> was forced in disorder
to raise his Siege at <HI>Groeningen,</HI> and the French
to quit <HI>Gorcom.</HI> I could add many more Ob∣servations
of the Providences of God to these
People, as the preserving the Prince of <HI>O∣range,</HI>
His present Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
from the many treacherous Designs contri∣ved
against him from his Cradle; but <HI>Moses</HI>
must be preserved, to go in and out before
his▪ People. Certainly never young Prince
endured so many Fatigues as did his High∣ness
in his tender Years, of which I was an
Eye-witness; and had his Highness had the
Years and Experience, and such a good Dis∣ciplined
Army (as now he hath) in the Year
1671. when the French entred the Coun∣try,
his Highness had given them as good a
Welcom as he did at <HI>Bergen.</HI> I will say no
more of this Subject, only this, That the
Peace at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> was also a very won∣derful
thing, for that not above eight Days
before the Peace was signed, most of the
Plenipotentiaries did believe the War would
<PB N="80" REF="45"/>
have continued another Year; first, because
the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and Duke of <HI>Branden∣burg</HI>
prospered exceedingly against <HI>Sweed∣land,</HI>
and totally refused the Propositions of
<HI>France;</HI> and secondly, because the French
King writ such bitter Letters against the
States-General: Yet eight Days after drest a
Letter unto the States, in which he calls
them his <HI>Good Friends, and Old Alleys,</HI> offer∣ing
them not only <HI>Maestricht,</HI> but every Foot
of Ground they could lay claim to in the
World; also giving them new Terms and
Conditions as to their Privileges in <HI>France,</HI>
by way of Trade. Neither can I forget how
speedily and as strangely the French King
did quit his Conquered Towns after the Va∣liant
Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> took <HI>Naerden,</HI> which
was the first step to the French's Ruine in
the States Dominions. I come now, accor∣ding
to promise in the beginning of this Book,
to give the Reader some Remarks I made
in other Countries where I have been, du∣ring
my Sixteen Years Travels. To give
a full account of all that might be observed
in so many Countries, is not a Task for one
Man, nor a Subject for so small a Book; I
shall only therefore briefly take notice of
some remarkable Matters which may in some
measure satisfie the Curiosity of my Country∣men,
who have not been in the said places,
and convince, if possible, all of them, that
no Country that ever I was in, affords so
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>
great Conveniencies for the generality of
People to live in, as the Kingdom of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
doth. Though I have twice made the
<HI>grand tour</HI> of <HI>Germany, Hungary, Italy</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> and after my return back to <HI>England,</HI>
travelling a third time through <HI>Holland</HI> as far
as <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and so back by <HI>Francfort</HI> to
<HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sueden;</HI> yet the Reader is not
to expect I should follow a Geographical
Method and Order in speaking of the Places
I have been in; that is to be lookt for in the
Map, and not in Travels; but only that I
mention Places as I found them on my Road,
according as Business or Curiosity led me to
Travel.</P>
<P>THE first considerable Place I then met
with, after I was out of the Dominions
of the States-General, was <HI>Cleave,</HI> the Capi∣tal
City of the Province so called; a fair and
lovely City standing upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and
the Rivers <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Leck.</HI> This Province
much resembles <HI>England</HI> in rich Soil, and
pleasantness of its Rivers. The Inhabitants
of the Country would have me believe that
they were Originally descended of those <HI>Sax∣ons</HI>
who made a descent into <HI>England,</HI> and
conquered it; and to convince the truth of
this, they shew'd me a Cloyster standing on
a Hill, called <HI>Eltham,</HI> from which they say
our <HI>Eltham</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> had its Name. I was
made to observe also two places standing
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>
upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> near <HI>Emmerick,</HI> called <HI>Doad∣ford,</HI>
and <HI>Gronewich,</HI> which according to
them, gave the Names to <HI>Dedford</HI> and <HI>Green∣wich</HI>
in <HI>England:</HI> But many such Analogies
and Similitudes of Names are to be found in
other places of <HI>Germany,</HI> but especially in up∣per
<HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI> The greatest part
of this Province of <HI>Cleave,</HI> and part of the
Dutchies of <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Berg,</HI> and of the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Marke</HI> and <HI>Ravensbourg,</HI> belongs to
the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> the rest belong∣ing
to the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> now Elector
<HI>Palatine,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Cologne.</HI> The
Inhabitants are partly Roman Catholicks,
partly Lutherans, and partly Calvinists, who
all live promiscuously and peaceably toge∣ther
both in City and Country. The City
of <HI>Cleave</HI> is the utmost Limit of the Territo∣ries
of the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> on this
side of <HI>Germany;</HI> from whence his Electoral
Highness can Travel Two Hundred Dutch
Miles out-right in his own Dominions, and
never sleep out of his own Country but one
Night in the Territories of the Bishop of
<HI>Osnabrug.</HI></P>
<P>FRom <HI>Cleave</HI> I went to a small Town
called <HI>Rhinberg,</HI> but a very strong For∣tification
belonging to the Elector of <HI>Co∣logne;</HI>
which lies at two Miles distance from
the City of <HI>Wesel,</HI> that belongs to the Elector
of <HI>Brandenbourg.</HI> Through <HI>Dusseldorpe,</HI> situated
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>
on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the Residence of the Duke
of <HI>Newbourg,</HI> I went next to <HI>Cologne,</HI> a very
large City, called by the Romans <HI>Colonia A∣grippina,</HI>
and the French <HI>Rome d'Allemagne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cologne</HI> is an Imperial City, and a Repub∣lick,
though for some things it does Homage
to the Elector of that Name, and receives
an Oath from him. It is much decayed with∣in
these Hundred Years, having been much
Priest-ridden; a Misfortune that hath un∣done
many other great Cities. The Jesuits
have had so great Influence upon the Magi∣strates,
that they prevailed with them to ba∣nish
all Protestants, who removed to <HI>Ham∣bourg</HI>
and <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> so that <HI>Cologne</HI> is be∣come
so dispeopled, that the Houses daily
fall to ruine for want of Inhabitants, and a
great deal of Corn and Wine now grows
within the Walls, upon Ground where Hou∣ses
formerly stood. I dare be bold to affirm,
that there is twice the Number of Inhabi∣tants
in the Parish of St. <HI>Martins in the Fields,</HI>
as there is in <HI>Cologne;</HI> and yet it contains
as many Parish-Churches, Monasteries and
Chappels, as there are days in the Year. The
Streets are very large, and so are the Hou∣ses
also, in many of which one may drive a
Coach or Wagon into the first Room from
the Streets: But the Streets are so thin of
People, that one may pass some of them and
not meet Ten Men or Women, unless it be
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>
Church-Men, or Religious Sisters. The
most considerable Inhabitants of the City are
Protestant Merchants, though but few in
Number, and they not allowed a Church
neither, but at a place called <HI>Woullin,</HI> a Mile
without the City; the rest of the Inhabitants,
who are Lay-men, are miserably poor. There
are no less than 3000 Students in <HI>Cologne</HI>
taught by the Jesuits <HI>gratis,</HI> who have the
privilege to beg in Musical Notes in the Day-time,
and take to themselves the liberty of
borrowing Hats and Cloaks in the Night.
But if in the Jesuits Schools there be any Rich
Burghermasters Sons who have Parts, they
are sure to be snapt up, and adopted into
the Society. Formerly, before the Matter
was otherwise adjusted in the Dyet of <HI>Ratu∣bonne,</HI>
there have been Designs of Voting
Protestant Magistrates into the Government
again; but so soon as the Jesuits came to dis∣cover
who of the Magistrates were for that,
they immediately preferred their Sons or
Daughters, and made them Canons, Abbots,
or Canonesses, and so diverted them by In∣terest.
It's pity to see a City so famous for
Traffick in former times, now brought to so
great a decay, that were it not for the Trade of
Rhenish-Wine, it would be utterly forsaken,
and left wholly to the Church-Men. The con∣tinual
Alarms the Magistrates have had by Fo∣reign
Designs upon their Liberty, and the Jea∣lousies
fomented among themselves, as it is
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>
thought, by the Agents and Favourers of
<HI>France,</HI> and especially the Bishop of <HI>Stras∣bourg,</HI>
have, for several years, kept them in
continual disquiet, and necessitated them to
raise great Taxes, which hath not a little con∣tributed
to the impoverishing of the People,
especially the Boars round about; who, tho'
the Country they live in be one of the most
pleasant and fertile Plains of <HI>Germany,</HI> yet
are so wretchedly poor, that Canvas Cloaths,
Wooden Shoes, and Straw to sleep on in
the same room with their Beasts, is the
greatest worldly Happiness that most of them
can attain unto. The Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> is
Bishop of four great Bishopricks, <HI>viz. Co∣logne,</HI>
Prince of <HI>Liege, Munster,</HI> and <HI>Hel∣dershime.</HI>
To speak of all the Miracles of the
three Kings of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and the vast number
of Saints, who were removed out of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and interred there, would be but tedi∣ous,
and perhaps incredible, to the Reader,
as well as wide of my design: I shall there∣fore
proceed.</P>
<P>FRom <HI>Cologne</HI> I took Water on the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
and advanced to the City of <HI>Bon,</HI> and
so forward to <HI>Coblentz,</HI> the Residence of the
Elector of <HI>Trier:</HI> Over-against this City, on
the other side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> stands that im∣pregnable
Fort called <HI>Herminshine,</HI> built on a
high rocky Hill, as high again as <HI>Windsor</HI>-Castle;
and on the North-side of it, the Ri∣ver
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
<HI>Moselle</HI> falls into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> over which
there is a stately Stone-Bridge. This Prince
governs his Subjects as the other Spiritual
Electors do, that is, both by Temporal and
Spiritual Authority, which in that Country
is pretty absolute. The chief Trade of this
Country is in Wine, Corn, Wood and
Iron.</P>
<P>THE next Country I came to was that of
the Elector of <HI>Mayence</HI> or <HI>Mentz,</HI> who is
likewise both a Secular and Ecclesiastical
Prince, and governs his Subjects accordingly.
He is reckoned to be wholly for the Interests
of the French King; who, notwithstanding of
that, pretends a Title to the Cittadel of
<HI>Mayence.</HI> As I was upon my Journey to
<HI>Mayence</HI> by Land, I made a turn down the
<HI>Rhine</HI> to visit the famous little City of <HI>Back∣rack,</HI>
and some Towns belonging to the
Landtgrave of <HI>Hesse,</HI> but especially <HI>Backrack,</HI>
because Travellers say, it much resembles
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> in its Situation and manner of
Buildings. The Burghermaster of this City
told me, that the whole Country about <HI>Back∣rack</HI>
does not yield above 200 Fouders of
Wine a year; and yet the Merchants of <HI>Dort,</HI>
by an Art of Multiplication, which they
have used some years, furnish <HI>England</HI> with
several thousand of Fouders. Here I shall
take the Liberty to relate a strange Story,
which, I found recorded in this Country, tho'
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>
I know it to be mentioned in History:
There was a certain cruel and inhuman Bi∣shop
of <HI>Mayence,</HI> who, in a year of great
scarcity and Famine, when a great number
of poor People came to his Gates begging
for Bread, caused the poor Wretches, Men,
Women, and Children, to be put into a
Barn, under pretext of relieving their Ne∣cessities,
but so soon as they were got in, caused
the Barn Doors to be shut, Fire set to it,
and so burnt them all alive: And whil'st the
poor Wretches cried and shrieked out for
Horror and Pain, the barbarous Miscreant
said to those that were about him, Hark,
how the Rats and Mice do cry. But the just
Judgment of GOD suffered not the Fact to
pass unpunished; for not long after the cruel
Bishop was so haunted with Rats and Mice,
that all the Guards he kept about him could
not secure him from them, neither at Table
nor in Bed; at length he resolved to flee for
Safety into a Tower that stood in the middle
of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> but the Rats pursued him▪
got into his Chamber, and devoured him
alive; so that the Justice of the Almighty
made him a Prey to Vermin, who had in∣humanly
reckoned his Fellow-Christians to
be such. The Tower, which I saw, to this
day is call'd the Rats-Tower, and the Story
is upon Record in the City of <HI>Mayence.</HI></P>
<P>On my Journey from thence I came to
the little Village of <HI>Hockom,</HI> not far distant,
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>
famous for our Hockomore-Wine, of which,
though the place does not produce above 150
Fouders a year, yet the ingenious Hollanders
of <HI>Dort</HI> make some thousand Fouders of it
go off in <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>FRom <HI>Hockom</HI> I proceeded to <HI>Francfort,</HI> a
pleasant City upon the River of <HI>Maine,</HI>
called formerly <HI>Teutoburgum</HI> and <HI>Helenop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lis,</HI>
and since <HI>Francfort,</HI> because here the Franco∣nians,
who came out of the Province of
<HI>Franconia,</HI> foarded over, when they went
upon their Expedition into <HI>Gallia,</HI> which
they conquered, and named it <HI>France:</HI> And
I thought it might very well deserve the
Name of <HI>Petty-London,</HI> because of its Privi∣leges,
and the Humour of the Citizens. It
is a Hansiatick and Imperial Town, and
Commonwealth, the Magistrates being Lu∣therans,
which is the publick established Re∣ligion;
though the Cathedral Church be∣longs
to the Roman Catholicks, who also
have several Monasteries there. The City
is populous, and frequented by all sorts of
Merchants, from most parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and
part of <HI>Asia</HI> also, because of the two great Fairs
that are yearly kept there: Many Jews live
in this City, and the richest Merchants are
Calvinists, who are not suffered to have a
Church in the Town, but half an hours
Journey out of it, at a place called <HI>Bucknam,</HI>
where <HI>I</HI> have told Seventy four Coaches at a
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
time, all belonging to Merchants of the
City. It was in ancient times much en∣rich'd
by <HI>Charlemain,</HI> and hath been since
by the Constitution of the <HI>Golden-Bull:</HI> A∣mongst
other Honours and Privileges, it's
appointed to be the place of the Emperor's
Election, where many of the Ornaments, be∣longing
to that August Ceremony, are to
be seen. It is strongly fortified, having a
stately Stone-bridge over the <HI>Mayne,</HI> that
joyns it to <HI>Saxe-housen,</HI> the Quarter of the
Great Master of the Teutonick-Order. The
Government is easie to the People, they not
being taxed as other Cities are; and had it
not been for the Alarms the French gave
them, during the last War, they had not
been much troubled, but being forced to
keep 3 or 4000 Men in constant Pay to de∣fend
their Fortifications, the Magistrates
were constrained to raise Money by a Tax.
Besides that of the Emperor, they are under
the Protection of some Neighbouring Prin∣ces,
as of the Landtgrave of <HI>Hesse-Cassel,</HI>
Landtgrave of <HI>Armstadt,</HI> the Count of <HI>Solmes,</HI>
and the Count of <HI>Hanau,</HI> who are either
Lutherans or Calvinists, amongst whom the
late Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> was also one; but whe∣ther
the present, who is a Roman Catho∣lick,
be so or not, I cannot tell. This
City takes great care of their Poor, and in
their Charity to poor Travellers exceed <HI>Hol∣land:</HI>
I have seen a List of Seven thousand
<PB N="90" REF="50"/>
whom they relieved in one year. Their
great Hospital is a large Court or Palace, where
the English Merchants formerly lived, in the
time of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Persecution of the
Protestants, who, when they were recalled by
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were so generous as to give
the whole Court, with all their Pack-houses
and Lands to the Poor of the City. It was
my fortune to be there in that cold Winter
in the year 1683, and saw a Ceremony
performed by the Wine-Coopers of the City,
who are obliged by Law, that when ever
the <HI>Maine</HI> lies fast frozen over for 8 days toge∣ther,
to make a great Fouder Fat, Hoops and
Staves, and set it up compleat upon the Ice.
It was very good diversion to see so many
Hands at Work, and to observe the jollity
and mirth of the many Thousands of Spe∣ctators,
who wanted not plenty of Rhenish
Wine to Carouse in.</P>
<P>I had the curiosity afterward to go to the
Court of the Landtgrave of <HI>Armestadt,</HI> a
Lutheran Prince, who lives in part of the
richest Soil in <HI>Germany.</HI> His Highness is a
very courteous and obliging Prince to Stran∣gers,
and his Subjects are in a pretty good
Condition again, though they have been great
Sufferers by the last War between the Landt∣grave
of <HI>Hesse</HI> and this Family.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="50"/>
FRom thence I went to <HI>Heidleberg,</HI> a City
I had been formerly in, in the Life time
of that Wise, though unfortunate Prince
Elector, Elder Brother to Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI>
Here I had the Honour to pay my Dutiful
Respects to the Elector, the Son of that great
Prince, whose Commissary I had the Ho∣nour
to be for two years together in <HI>Amster∣dam.</HI>
This Prince, since my being there, is
Dead, and left behind him the Reputation
of having been a zealous thorough paced
Calvinist, and so constant a frequenter of the
Church, that some Sundays he went thrice
a day to Sermon; but never failed, if in
Health, to be once a day at least at the Ga∣rison
Church, where he took particular no∣tice
of such Officers as were absent. He was
Married to a most Virtuous Lady, the Royal
Sister of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and his Bro∣ther
Prince <HI>George.</HI> During his Life time the
University of <HI>Heidleberg</HI> flourished exceed∣ingly,
so that the number of Students was
so great, that Chambers and Lodgings in the
City were scarce, and <HI>Spanhemius</HI> was about
quitting <HI>Leyden</HI> to return to his Professors
place in <HI>Heidleberg;</HI> but how matters stand
since his Death, I am as yet ignorant. This
Country is called, the Paradise of <HI>Germany,</HI>
for its fruitfulness in Wine, Corn, and all
sorts of Fruit. I my self have seen growing
in one Plain, at the same time, Vines, Corn,
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
Chestnuts, Almonds, Dates, Figs, Cherries,
besides several other sorts of Fruit. And as
the Country is fertile in yielding the Fruits
of the Earth, so the People are careful in
providing Store Room for them. This I
take notice of, because of the prodigious
Rhenish Wine Fats which are to be seen there,
amongst which there are Seven, the least
whereof holds the quantity of 250 Barils of
Beer, as I calculated; but the large and most
celebrated Fat is that which goes by the name
of the great Tun of <HI>Heidleberg,</HI> and holds 204
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Fouder contains 4 Hogsheads.</NOTE>Fouders of Wine, and cost 705 <HI>l.</HI>
Sterling in Building, for which
one may have a very good House
built. This Fat I have seen twice,
and the first time was, when the Elector
Treated the French Ambassadors that came
to conclude the Match betwixt his Daugh∣ter,
and Monsieur the French Kings Bro∣ther,
who Married her after the Death of
<HI>Henrietta</HI> his first Wife; at which Treat there
happened an adventure, that I shall here
please the Reader with. In a Gallery that
is over this Fat, the Elector caused a Table
to be placed in the middle, exactly above the
Bunghole of this Monstrous Vessel, and to be
covered with a costly Banquet of all sorts of
Sweat-Meats: The day before, all the Wine
being emptied out of this Tun into other
Fats, a little before the Ambassadors, with
other Foreign Ministers and Persons of Qua∣lity
mounted the Stairs to come to the place
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
of Entertainment, the Elector caused twelve
Drummers, with as many Trumpeters, some
Kettle-Drums, and other Musick, to be lodged
in the Belly of the Tun, with orders to strike
up, upon a signal given, when the Elector
drank the French Kings Health. All being
sat down at Table, and merrily Feeding,
the Elector drank the Health, and the Signal
was given; whereupon the Musick began
to play its part, with such a roaring and un∣couth
Noise out of that vast Cavity below,
that the French and other Persons of Qua∣lity
who were unacquainted with the design,
looking upon it to be an infernal and omi∣nous
Sound, in great astonishment began to
cry out, <HI>Jesu Maria, The Worlds at an end,</HI>
and to shift every one for himself in so great
Disorder and Confusion, that for haste to be
gone they tumbled down Stairs one over
another. All that the Elector could say to
compose them, was either not heard, or not
valued, nor could any thing satisfie and re∣assure
them, till they saw the Actors come
marching out of their Den. Had not many
Persons of Quality and Travellers seen this
Fat as well as my self, who know that what
I say of its incredible bigness to be true, I
should be afraid the Reader might think I
imposed upon his Credulity.</P>
<P>From <HI>Heidleberg</HI> I went to see that im∣pregnable
Fort or Cittadel of <HI>Manheim allas
Fredericksberg,</HI> built by the Elector <HI>Frederick,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>
Brother to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> a Prince of as
good a Head as any <HI>Germany</HI> afforded; who
though some have too partially judged of
him by his Misfortunes, yet by the wisest of
the Age was accounted the <HI>Cato</HI> of <HI>Germany.</HI>
The Wisest and best Men of the World have
been unfortunate, which makes some to be
of the Opinion, That God in his Wisdom
thinks fit it should be so, lest otherwise they
might attribute their Prosperity rather to the
wise direction of their own Conduct, than
his All-seeing Providence: And indeed, daily
Experience seems to evince the Truth of this,
since we see Knaves and Fools advanced to
Preferment and Riches, when Men of Virtue
and Parts die neglected, and poor in the
Eyes of the World, though rich in the en∣joyment
of a contented Mind. But this is a
digression which the Honour I have for the
memory of that great Man hath led me into,
and therefore I hope will be pardoned by
the Reader. In the Cittadel of <HI>Manheim</HI> I
saw some of the Records of that Illustrious
Family, which without dispute is the most
ancient of all the Secular Electors, being El∣der
to that of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which sprung from
one and the same Stock; to wit, two Em∣perors
of <HI>Germany.</HI> Many Writers derive
them originally from <HI>Charlemain,</HI> by the
Line of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France.</HI> There have
been several Emperors of that Race, one
King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and four Kings of <HI>Sueden,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>
one of which was King of <HI>Norway</HI> also, be∣sides
many great Generals of Armies in <HI>Ger∣many,
Hungary, France,</HI> and other Countrys.
Since I can remember there were five Pro∣testant
Princes Heirs to that Electoral Dig∣nity
alive; which now by their Death is
fallen to the Duke of <HI>Newbourg,</HI> the present
Prince Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> a Roman Catholick,
whose Daughter is Empress of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
another of his Daughters Married to the
King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> a third to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
and a fourth to Prince <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>BEing so near <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> I had the curi∣osity
to go see what figure that Famous
City now made, since it had changed its
Master; for I had been thrice there before,
when it flourished under the Emperors Pro∣tection,
with the liberty of a Hansiatick
Town: And indeed, I found it so disfigured,
that had it not been for the stately Cathedral
Church, and fair Streets, and Buildings, I
could scarcely have known it. In the Streets
and Exchange, which formerly were throng∣ed
with sober, rich, and peaceable Merchants,
you meet with none hardly now but Men
in Buff-Coats and Scarffs, with rabbles of
Soldiers their Attendants. The Churches I
confess are gayer, but not so much frequented
by the Inhabitants as heretofore, seeing the
Lutherans are thrust into the meanest
<PB N="96" REF="53"/>
Churches, and most of the chief Merchants,
both Lutherans and Calvinists, removed to
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hambourg.</HI> Within a few years,
I beleive it will be just such another City for
Trade and Riches as <HI>Brisac</HI> is. It was for∣merly
a rich City, and well stockt with Mer∣chants
and wealthy Inhabitants, who lived
under a gentle and easie Government; but
now the Magistrates have little else to do in
the Government, but only to take their
Rules and Measures from a Cittadel and
great Guns, which are Edicts that Merchants
least understand. I confess, <HI>Strasbourg</HI> is the
less to be pittied that it so tamely became a
Slave, and put on its Chains without any
strugling. Those Magistrates who were In∣struments
in it, are now sensible of their own
Folly, and bite their Nails for Anger, finding
themselves no better, but rather worse hated
than the other Magistrates, who did what
they could to hinder the Reception of their
new Masters the French. I quickly grew
weary of being here, meeting with nothing
but complaints of Poverty, and paying ex∣orbitant
Taxes.</P>
<P>I therefore soon returned to my <HI>Petty-London,
Francfort,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Cas∣sel,</HI>
the chief Residence of the Landtgrave
of <HI>Hesse.</HI> This Prince is a Calvinist, as most
of his Subjects are, very grave and zealous
in his Religion: He Married a Princess of
<PB N="97" REF="53"/>
<HI>Courland,</HI> by whom he hath an hopeful Issue;
to wit, three Sons, and two Daughters.
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was God-Father to one of
his Sons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was Christened by the Name
of <HI>Charles;</HI> Captain <HI>William Legg,</HI> Brother to
the Lord <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> representing his Ma∣jesty
as his Envoy. The Court of this Prince
does indeed resemble a well-governed Col∣lege,
or Religious Cloister, in regard of its
Modesty and Regularity in all Things, and
especially in the Hours of Devotion. He is
Rich in Money, and entertains about Nine
Thousand Men in constant Pay, under the
Command of Count <HI>Vanderlip,</HI> a brave and
expert Soldier, his Lieutenant General, but
can bring many more upon occasion into
Field. This Family hath been very happy
both in its Progeny and Alliances, many
Wise Princes of both Sexes having sprung
from it; and the Mother of this present
Landtgrave may be reckoned amongst the
Illustrious Women of the present and past
Ages. After the Death of <HI>William</HI> V. Landt∣grave
of <HI>Hesse</HI> her Husband, she not only
supported, but advanced the War wherein
he was engaged, did many signal Actions,
enlarged her Territories, and at the conclu∣sion
of the Peace, kept under her Pay 56
Cornets of Horse in five Regiments, 166
Companies of Foot, besides 13 Companies
of Dragoons, and 14 Independent Compa∣nies,
in all 249 Companies of Horse and
<PB N="98" REF="54"/>
Foot: She was a Princess extreamly obliging
to Strangers, especially virtuous and learned
Divines. I had the Honour a good many
years ago to kiss her Highnesses Hand, at
which time she was mighty Zealous in pro∣moting
an Accommodation amongst diffe∣rent
Religions, as the Roman Catholick,
Lutheran and Calvinist, but especially be∣twixt
the two latter; and therefore enter∣tained
Doctor <HI>Duris,</HI> at her Court in <HI>Cassels,</HI>
who wrote several pieces upon that Subject
of Reconciliation, and with some of his Friends
had a Conference with a Learned Priest,
that came from <HI>Rome</HI> to forward the Project;
whereupon the Doctor Published his Book of
the <HI>Harmony of Consent,</HI> which is highly
esteemed in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>FRom this Princes Court I directed my
Journey to <HI>Hanouer,</HI> taking <HI>Lambspring</HI>
in my way, a place where there is a Con∣vent
of English Monks; and there I met
with a very aged, worthy, and harmless
Gentleman, Sir <HI>Thomas Gascoigne,</HI> a Person of
seeming great Integrity and Piety; the Lord
Abbot and several of the Monks I had seen
there formerly. This Monastery is very ob∣liging
to all Strangers that Travel that way,
as well as to their own Country-men, and is
highly respected by the Neighbouring Princes
of all Perswasions, as the Princes of the House
of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> the Landtgrave of <HI>Hesse,</HI> and
<PB N="99" REF="54"/>
Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> who as Bishop of <HI>Hil∣dersheim</HI>
is their Ordinary. The Town of
<HI>Lambspring</HI> is Lutheran, though under the
Government of the Lord Abbot and his
Chapter, who constantly chuse Lutheran
Magistrates and Officers for the Civil Ad∣ministration,
and live together in that Love
and Unity, that as yet there hath never the
least debate happened amongst them; and
indeed, this Harmony is now to be observed
in most parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> where different
Religions are professed. When I considered
so many goodly Faces, both of Monks and
Students in that Abbey, I could not forbear
to make a serious Reflection on the number
of the English whom I had seen in the Col∣leges
and Cloisters abroad, as at <HI>Rome, Ratis∣bonne,
Wirtzburg</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> at <HI>Liege, Lou∣vain,
Brussels, Dunkirk, Ghent, Paris,</HI> and
other places, besides the Nunneries; and
withall, on the loss that both King and King∣dom
suffered thereby, when so many of our
Natives, both Men and Women should be
constrained to spend their own Estates, and
the Benevolence of others in a strange Land,
which amounts to more Money than at first
one may imagine; and this thought, I con∣fess,
made me wish it were otherwise. I
would not have the Reader to mistake me
here, as if I Espoused, or Pleaded for any
particular Party; no, I plead only for the
Sentiments of Humanity, without which
<PB N="100" REF="55"/>
our Nature degenerates into that of Brutes,
and for the love that every honest Man
ought to have for his Country. I am as
much a Friend to the Spanish Inquisition,
as to the persecuting of tender Conscien∣ced
Protestants, provided there be no more
but Conscience in the Case: And I could
heartily wish that Papists and Protestants
could live as lovingly together in <HI>England,</HI>
as they do in <HI>Holland, Germany,</HI> and other
Countries; for give me leave to say it, I
love not that Religion, which in stead of
Exalting, destroys the Principles of Mora∣lity
and human Society. I have met with
honest Men of all Perswasions, even Turks
and Jews, who in their Lives and Manners
have far exceeded many of our Enthusia∣stick
Professors at home; and when ever
this happened, I could not forbear to love
the Men without embracing their Religion,
for which they themselves are to account to
their great Master and Judge.</P>
<P>In my progress towards <HI>Hanouer</HI> I
touched at <HI>Hildersheim,</HI> a City whose Ma∣gistrates
are Lutheran, though Roman
Catholicks have the Cathedral Church,
and several Monasteries there. The Court
of <HI>Hanouer</HI> makes another kind of Figure
than that of <HI>Cassels,</HI> it being the Court of
a great Prince, who is Bishop of <HI>Osnaburg,</HI>
Duke of <HI>Brunswick, Lunenburg, Hanouer,
&amp;c.</HI> Here I had the Honour to Kiss the
<PB N="101" REF="55"/>
Hands of the Princess Royal <HI>Sophia,</HI> young∣est
Sister to the late Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI> Her
Highness has the Character of the <HI>Merry
Debonnaire</HI> Princess of <HI>Germany,</HI> a Lady of
Extraordinary Virtue and Accomplishments,
and Mistress of the Italian, French, High and
Low Dutch, and English Languages,
which she speaks to Perfection. Her Hus∣band
has the Title of the Gentleman of
<HI>Germany,</HI> a graceful and comely Prince
both a Foot, and on Horseback, Civil to
Strangers beyond compare, infinitely Kind
and Beneficent to People in Distress, and
known in the World for a Valiant and
Experienced Soldier. I had the Honour
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Troops, which, without Contro∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>
are as good Men, and Commanded
by as expert Officers as any are in <HI>Europe:</HI>
Amongst his Officers I found brave <HI>Steel-Hand
Gordon,</HI> Colonel of an excellent Re∣giment
of Horse, <HI>Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot,</HI>
and others of our Kings Subjects. God hath
blest the Prince with a numerous Off-spring,
having six Sons, all gallant Princes; of
whom the two Eldest signalized themselves
so bravely at the raising of the Siege of
<HI>Vienna,</HI> that as undoubted proof of their
Valour, they brought three Turks home to
this Court Prisoners. His eldest Son is
Married to a most beautiful Princess, sole
Heiress of the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> and <HI>Zell</HI>'s
Elder Brother; as the lovely Princess his
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>
Daughter is Married to the Duke of
<HI>Brandenburg.</HI> He is a gracious Prince to
his People, and keeps a very splendid Court,
having in his Stables for the use of himself
and Children, no less than Fifty two sets of
Coach-Horses: He himself is a Lutheran,
but as his Subjects are Christians of different
Perswasions, and some of them Jews too, so
both in his Court and Army he entertains
Gentlemen of various Opinions and Coun∣tries,
as Italian Abbots, and Gentlemen that
serve him, and many Calvinist French
Officers: Neither is he so Bigotted in his
Religion, but that he and his Children go
many times to Church with the Princess,
who is a Calvinist, and join with her in her
Devotion. His Country is good, having
Gold and Silver Mines in it, and his Sub∣jects
live well under him; as do those also
of his Brother the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> and
their Cozen the Duke of <HI>Wolfembuttel,</HI> which
are the three Princes of the House of <HI>Lunen∣bourg;</HI>
of whom it may be said, that they
have always stuck honestly to the right side,
and befriended the Interests of the Empire;
so that no by-Respect, neither Honour nor
Profit, could ever prevail with them, as it
has with others, to make them abandon the
publick Concern.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="56"/>
FRom this Princes Court I went to <HI>Zell,</HI> the
Residence of the Duke the elder Brother
of the Family. This Prince is called the
Mighty <HI>Nimrod,</HI> because of the great delight
he takes in Horses, Dogs, and Hunting. He
did me the honour to let me see his Stables,
wherein he keeps 370 Horses, most of them
English, or of English Breed. His Dogs,
which are also English, are so many, that
with great care they are quartered in several
Apartments according to their Kind and
Qualities, there being a large Office like a
Brewhouse employed for boyling of Malt
and Corn for them. It is this valiant Prince
who took <HI>Trieves</HI> from the French, and made
the Mareschal <HI>de Crequi</HI> Prisoner: He is ex∣treamly
obliging to Strangers, and hath seve∣ral
brave Scotish Officers under his Pay, as
Major-General <HI>Erskin, Graham, Coleman, Ha∣milton,
Melvin,</HI> and others. His Lieutenant-General
is one <HI>Chavot</HI> a Protestant of <HI>Alsa∣tia,</HI>
an excellent and experienced Comman∣der.
I shall add no more concerning this
Prince, his Officers, or Country; but that
he, with the other two Princes of the House
of <HI>Lunenbourg, Hanouer,</HI> and <HI>Wolfembuttel,</HI>
can upon occasion bring into the Field 36000
Soldiers, whom they keep in constant Pay,
and such Men as I never saw better in my
life.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="57"/>
AFter some stay at the Court of the Duke
of <HI>Zell,</HI> I went to <HI>Hambourg,</HI> a famous
Hansiatick Town. It is a Republick, and City
of great Trade, occasioned partly by the
English Company of <HI>Merchant Adventurers,</HI>
but much more by the Dutch Protestants,
who in the time of the Duke of <HI>Alba</HI> for∣sook
the Low-Countries and settled here, and
the Protestants also who were turned out of
<HI>Cologne,</HI> and other Places in <HI>Germany;</HI> who
nevertheless are not now allowed Publick
Churches within the City, but at a place called
<HI>Altena,</HI> a Village belonging to the King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
a quarter of an hours walk distant from
<HI>Hambourg.</HI> This Commonwealth is <HI>Luthe∣ran,</HI>
and governed by 4 Burghermasters, 24
Radts-heers, and a Common-Council of all
the Burghers who have above 40 Shillings
<HI>per Annum</HI> Freehold. The Symbol or Motto
under their Arms, is, <HI>Da Pacem Domine in
Diebus nostris;</HI> and in their Standards are
these Letters <HI>S. P. Q. H.</HI> The People here
groan under heavy Taxes and Impositions;
The State, because of continual Alarms they
have from the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> or other
Neighbours; and the Intestine Broils that
frequently happen here, as well as at <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gne,</HI>
where the Burghermasters are often in dan∣ger
of their Lives from the mutinous Mo∣bile;
being forced to maintain 6 or 7000
Men in Pay, besides 2 or 3 Men of War to
<PB N="105" REF="57"/>
guard their Havens from Pirats. I shall not
name all the ways of imposing Taxes which
this Commonwealth uses, because in most
they imitate the Methods of the States-Ge∣neral
as to that, which have been mentioned
before: I shall only take notice of some pe∣culiar
Customs they have, wherein they
differ from <HI>Holland.</HI> When a Barber, Shoe∣maker,
or any other Artizan dies, leaving
a Widow and Children, another of the
same Trade is not admitted to set up for
himself as a Master, unless he compound
with the Widow for a piece of Money, or
else marry her, or a Daughter of hers with
her consent.</P>
<P>If any Man cause another to be Arrested
for Debt, or upon any other Suit, the
Plaintiff must go along with the Officer who
Arrests the Party, and stay by him until
the Prisoner be examined by the Sheriff;
so that if the Sheriff be not to be spoken
with that night, the Plaintiff must tarry
with the Prisoner all night, until the Sheriff
examin the matter, and see cause of dis∣charging
or committing the Party; but
this a Plaintiff may do by a Procuration
Notarial.</P>
<P>If a Prisoner be committed for Debt, the
Plaintiff must maintain him in Prison ac∣cording
to his Quality; and if the Party
lie in Prison during the space of 6 Years, at
the expiration of that time the Prisoner is
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>
discharged; and if during the time of his
Imprisonment the Plaintiff do not punctu∣ally
pay the Prisoner's Allowance at the
Months end, the Prisoner is set at liberty,
and nevertheless the Plaintiff must pay the
Gaoler the last Month's Allowance.</P>
<P>This State is severe in the execution of
Justice against Thieves, Murderers, and
Cheats. There is no Pardon to be expe∣cted
for Murder, and a Burghermaster him∣self,
if Guilty, cannot escape. The Pu∣nishment
for Murder is here as in <HI>Sweden,</HI>
breaking Malefactors on the Wheel, pinching
their Breasts and Arms with hot Pincers,
spitting them in at the Fundament, and out
at the Shoulder: They have also cruel ways
of Torturing to make Prisoners confess;
and are very careful not to be cheated in
their Publick Revenue, their Excise-men
and Collectors being Punished as in <HI>Holland.</HI>
They take a very good course not to be
cheated in their Excise, for all the Mills of
the Country are in the hands of the State;
so that no Baker nor Brewer can grind his
own Corn, but must have it ground at the
States Mills, where they pay the Excise.
There is a General Tax upon all Houses,
and that is the Eighth Penny, which never∣theless
does not excuse them from Chimney-money.
The States here, as at <HI>Genoua</HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> are the Publick Vintners, of whom
all People must buy their Wine, which
<PB N="107" REF="58"/>
they buy from the Merchant, or otherwise
import it in their own Ships. In their Ce∣remonies
of Burying and Christening, they
are ridiculously Prodigal; as for Instance: If
one invite a Burghermaster, he must give
him a Ducat in Gold; if a Radts-heer, that
is, an Alderman, a Rixdollar; to every
Preacher, Doctor of Physick, Advocate or
Secretary, half a Rixdollar; and to every
Schoolmaster, the third part of a Rixdollar.
The Women are the Inviters to Burials,
Weddings, and Christenings, who wear an
Antick kind of a Dress, having Mitred Caps
as high again as the Mitre of a Bishop.
The Churches here are rich in Revenues
and Ornaments, as Images and stately Or∣gans,
wherein they much delight. They
are great Lovers of <HI>Musick,</HI> insomuch that I
have told 75 Masters of several sorts of Mu∣sick
in one Church, besides those who were
in the Organ-Gallery. Their Organs are
extraordinary large: I measured the great
Pipes in the Organs of St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s and
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Churches, and found them to be
3 Foot and 3 quarters in circumference, and
32 Foot long; in each of which Organs
there are two Pipes 5 Foot and 8 Inches
round. The Wealth and Trade of this
City encreases daily; they send one Year
with another 70 Ships to <HI>Greenland,</HI> and
have wonderfully Engrossed that Trade
from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and it's believed,
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>
that small and great there are belonging to
this Commonwealth five thousand Sail of
Ships. After <HI>Amsterdam, Genoua</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI>
their Bank is reckoned the chief in Credit;
but in Trade they are accounted the third in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and come next to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Am∣sterdam.
Hambourg</HI> is now become the Ma∣gazine
of <HI>Germany,</HI> and of the Baltick and
Northern Seas. They give great Privileges
to the Jews, and to all Strangers whatsoever,
especially the English Company of Merchant
Adventurers, whom they allow a large Build∣ing,
where they have a Church, and where
the Deputy-Governour, Secretary, Minister,
and the other Officers of the Company live,
to whom they yearly make Presents of Wine,
Beer, Sheep, Salmond and Sturgeon in their
seasons. And so much of <HI>Hambourg.</HI></P>
<P>FRom <HI>Hambourg</HI> I went to <HI>Lubeck,</HI> which
is also a Commonwealth and Imperial
Town. It is a large well-built City, con∣taining
ten Parish-Churches; the Cathedral
dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> being in length 500
Foot, with two high Spires all covered with
Brass, as the rest of the Churches of that Ci∣ty
are. In former times this City was the
place where the Deputies of all the Hansia∣tick
Towns assembled, and was once so
powerful as to make War against <HI>Denmark</HI>
and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and to conquer several places
and Islands belonging to those two Crowns,
<PB N="109" REF="59"/>
nay and to lend Ships to <HI>England</HI> and other
Potentates, without any prejudice to their
own Trade, wherein they vyed in all parts
with their Neighbours; but it is now ex∣ceedingly
run into decay, not only in Ter∣ritories,
but in Wealth and Trade also. And
the reason of that was chiefly the Inconside∣rate
Zeal of their Lutheran Ministers, who
perswaded the Magistrates to banish all Ro∣man
Catholicks, Calvinists, Jews, and all
that dissented from them in matter of Reli∣gion,
even the English Company too, who
all went and setled in <HI>Hambourg,</HI> to the great
Advantage of that City, and almost ruine of
<HI>Lubeck,</HI> which hath not now above 200 Ships
belonging to it, nor more Territories to the
State than the City it self, and a small part
called <HI>Termond,</HI> about eight Miles distant from
it. The rest of their Territories are now in
the possession of the Danes and Swedes, by
whom the Burghers are so continually alarm∣ed,
that they are quite tired out with keep∣ing
Guard, and paying of Taxes. The Ci∣ty
is indeed well fortified; but the Govern∣ment
not being able to maintain above 1500
Soldiers in pay, 400 Burghers in two Com∣panies
are obliged to watch every Day. They
have a large well-built Stadthouse, and an
Exchange covered, on the top whereof the
Globes of the World are painted. This Ex∣change
is about 50 Yards in the length, and
but 15 in breadth: Over it there is a Room
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>
where the Skins of five Lyons which the
Burghers killed at the City-Gates in the Year
1252. are kept stuft. The great Market-place
is very large, where a Monumental-Stone
is to be seen, on which one of their
Burghermasters was beheaded for running
away without fighting in a Sea-Engagement.
The People here spend much time in their
Churches at Devotion, which consists chiefly
in Singing. The Women are beautiful, but
disfigured with a kind of Antick Dress, they
wearing Cloaks like Men. It is cheap living
in this Town: For one may hire a Palace
for a matter of 20 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, and have Pro∣visions
at very reasonable Rates; besides the
Air and Water is very good, the City being
supplied with Fountains of Excellent Fresh
Water, which <HI>Hambourg</HI> wants; and good
Ground for Celleridge, there being Cellars
here 40 or 50 Foot deep.</P>
<P>I Had the Curiosity to go from <HI>Lubeck</HI> to
see the Ancient City of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> but
found it so ruined and decayed by the Swe∣dish
War, that I had no Encouragement to
stay there. I therefore hastened to <HI>Berlin,</HI>
the chief Residence of the Elector of <HI>Bran∣denburg;</HI>
at whose Court I met with a very
Ingenuous French Merchant, who told me,
that he, and divers other Merchants, were
designed to have lived in <HI>England,</HI> but were
discouraged by a Letter sent from <HI>London,</HI> by
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
a French-Man that was removing from thence
to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> for these following Reasons,
which I Copied out of his Letter.</P>
<P>First, Because the Reformed Religion is
persecuted in <HI>England</HI> as it is <HI>France;</HI> the
which I told him was a great Untruth, for
it is apparent that they have been all along
graciously admitted, and received into his
Majesties Dominions, without interruption,
and allowed the free Exercise of their own
Form of Worship, according to the Doctrine
and Discipline of the Churches of <HI>France.</HI>
Nor can they who converse with the French
Ministers either in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> be igno∣rant,
that the chiefest part, if not all those
Ministers, are willing to comply with the
Church of <HI>England;</HI> and it is evident that
most of the Dutch and French Protestants
(so called) in <HI>Holland</HI> make use of Organs in
their Churches.</P>
<P>A second thing was, that both the Bank
at <HI>London</HI> and the Bankers Goldsmiths were
all broak; the which I told this Frenchman
was not true altogether, for there are many
able Bankers whom I named: Neither was
the Bank (as he called the Chamber of <HI>Lon∣don)</HI>
broak, only it had been under the ma∣nagement
of a bad Person, whose design was
to bring it into disgrace. Besides, there is
the <HI>East-India-Company</HI> an unquestionable Se∣curity
for those as have Money to dispose of,
together with another undeniable Security
which is Land.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="61"/>
Thirdly, he saith, That in <HI>England</HI> there
is no Register, and therefore many Frauds
in Purchases and Morgages, which beget
tedious Suits, and renders both dangerous
to trust.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That if a Man would purchase
Land he cannot, being an Alien, until Na∣turalized.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That in <HI>England</HI> there are so ma∣ny
Plots and Confusions in Government,
that the Kingdom is hardly quiet 20 Years
together.</P>
<P>Sixthly, that false Witnesses were so com∣mon
in <HI>England,</HI> and the Crime of Perjury
so slightly punished, that no Man could be
safe in Life or Estate, if he chanced to be
in Trouble.</P>
<P>Lastly he said, that the English are so rest∣less
and quarelsom, that they not only fo∣ment
and cherish Animosities amongst one
another, but are every foot contriving and
plotting against their Lawful Sovereign, and
the Government. By such Surmises and In∣sinuations
as these, the French and Germans
are scared from trusting themselves and For∣tunes
in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore settle in <HI>Am∣sterdam,
Hamburgh,</HI> and other Cities, where
there are Banks and Registers: This I say is
one cause, why there are now to be seen at
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> such vast numbers of French and
Germans, who have much enrich'd that
City, and raised the Rents of the Houses 20
<PB N="113" REF="61"/>
<HI>per Cent.</HI> And the Silk-weavers grow also ve∣ry
rich, keeping so many Alms-Children to
do their Work, and having all their Labour
without any Charge, only for the teaching
them their Trades; which hath lessened the
Revenues of the French Crown, and will,
in time, greatly increase the number of the
States Subjects, and advance their publick
Incomes.</P>
<P>Having made this Digression, I return to
<HI>Berlin;</HI> It is a City enlarged with fair Streets
and Palaces: The Magistrates of the place
are Lutherans, which is the publick establish∣ed
Religion in all the Electors Dominions;
though he himself and his Children be Cal∣vinists:
He is look'd upon to be so true to
that Persuasion, that he is reckoned the Pro∣tector
of the Calvinists; and indeed he sol∣licited
the Emperor very hard for a Tolera∣tion
of the Protestants in <HI>Hungary.</HI> His
Chaplains, as most of the Lutheran Mini∣sters
also, endeavour to imitate the English
in their way of Preaching: And his High∣ness
is so much taken with English Divinity,
that he entertains Divines for translating En∣glish
Books into the German Tongue, as
<HI>The Whole Duty of Man,</HI> and several others.
He has a large and stately Palace at <HI>Berlin,</HI>
and therein a copious Library, enriched with
many Manuscripts, Medals, and Rarities of
Antiquity. He may compare with most
Princes for handsom Guards, being all of
<PB N="114" REF="62"/>
them proper well-bodied Men, and most
part Officers who ride in his Guards of
Horse. As he is known in the World to be
a Valiant and Warlike Prince, so he main∣tains
in Pay an Army of 36000 Men; be∣sides
five or six thousand Horsemen, who in
time of War are modelled into Troops;
with which Body during the late War with
<HI>Sweden,</HI> his Highness's Father in Person beat
the <HI>Swedes</HI> out of his Country. He keeps
his Forces in strict Discipline, obliging all
the Officers, if Protestants, on <HI>Sundays</HI> and
Holy-days to march their several Companies
in order to Church; but if a Superiour Of∣ficer
be of a contrary Perswasion, then the
next in Commission supplies his place. This
custom is Religiously observed by all his High∣nesses
Garisons, whilst he himself goes con∣stantly
to the Calvinist Church adjoyning
to the Court, with his Children, being five
Sons, two Daughters, and two Daughters-in-Law.</P>
<P>Amongst other Acts of Publick Piety and
Charity, this Prince hath established and en∣dowed
some Religious Houses or Nunneries
for Protestant young Ladies, where they
may live virtuously, and spend their time in
Devotion as long as they please, or other∣wise
Marry, if they think fit, but then they
lose the benefit of the Monastery. There is
one of these at <HI>Hertford</HI> in <HI>Westphalia,</HI> where
I was, and had the Honour to wait upon
<PB N="115" REF="62"/>
the Lady Abbess the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> eldest
Sister of the late Elector Palatine and
Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI> Notwithstanding the late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and that by the prevalency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>France</HI> in that hasty Treaty of Peace co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣ded
at <HI>Nim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guen,</HI> his late Electoral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
was obliged to give back what he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
taken from that Crown; yet his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
flourished in Wealth and Trade, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
having encouraged Manufactures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
by inviting Artizans into his Domin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
established a Company of Trading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> which will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
advance Navigation amongst his Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>▪
And in all humane probability they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to continue in a happy condition, seeing by
the Alliances his Highness hath made with
the Protestant Princes of the Empire, and
especially the House of <HI>Lunenbourg,</HI> they are
in no danger of being disturbed by their
Neighbours.</P>
<P>I told you before that the Elector of <HI>Bran∣denbourg</HI>
was Married to the Daughter of the
Duke of <HI>Hanouer,</HI> so that as long as that Al∣liance
holds, the Families of <HI>Brandenbourg</HI>
and <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> will be in a condition to cast
the Balance of the Empire; they both toge∣ther
being able to bring into the Field 80000
as good Men as any are in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="63"/>
WHen I parted from <HI>Berlin,</HI> I made
a turn back to <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> in my
way to <HI>Swedeland,</HI> where I found several of
my Countrymen Officers in the Garison,
who shewed me what was most remarkable
in the City, as the Saltworks, (which bring
in considerable Sums of Money to the
Duke of <HI>Lunenbourg)</HI> the Stadthouse, and
Churches, in one of which I saw a Commu∣nion-Table
of pure Ducat-Gold. From
thence I went into the Province of <HI>Holstein</HI>
and at a small Sea-port called <HI>Termond,</HI> of
which I spake before, I embarked for <HI>Swe∣den.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="63"/>
HE that hath read in the Histories of this
last Age the great Exploits of <HI>Gustavus
Adolphus</HI> and his <HI>Swedes,</HI> perhaps may have
a fancy that it must be an excellent Country
which hath bred such Warriors; but if he
approach it, he will soon find himself unde∣ceived.
Entering into <HI>Swedeland,</HI> at a place
called <HI>Landsort,</HI> we sail'd forward amongst high
Rocks, having no other prospect from Land
but Mountains till we came to <HI>Dollers,</HI> which
is about four Swedish, that is, twenty four
English Miles from <HI>Stockholm,</HI> the Capital
City of the Kingdom. Upon my coming
ashore, I confess I was a little surprized to
see the Poverty of the People; and the little
Wooden Houses they lived in, not unlike
Soldiers Huts in a Leaguer; but much more,
when I discovered little else in the Country
but Mountainous Rocks, and standing Lakes
of Water. The Reader will excuse me, I
hope, if I remark not all that I may have
taken notice of in this Country, seeing by
what I have already written, he may per∣ceive
that my Design is rather to observe the
Manner of the Inhabitants living, than to
give a full Description of every thing that
may be seen in the Country they live in.
However, I shall say somewhat of that too,
having premised once for all, that the ordi∣nary
People are wretchedly poor; yet not
so much occasioned by the Publick Taxes,
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>
as the Barronness of their Country, and the
Oppression of the Nobles their Landlord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and immediate Superiours, who till the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t
King put a stop to their Violences, ty∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nically
domineered over the Lives and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the poor Peasants.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llers</HI> I took Waggon to <HI>Stockholm,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Horses three times by the way,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the badness of the Rode, on all
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with Rocks, that hardly
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as here and there to leave a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ground. At two Miles di∣stance
upon that Road the City of <HI>Stock∣holm</HI>
looks great, because of the King's Pa∣lace,
the Houses of Noblemen, and some
Churches which are seated upon Rocks: And
indeed, the whole City and Suburbs stand
upon Rocks, unless it be some few Houses
built upon Ground gained from the Rivers
that run through the Town. <HI>Stockholm</HI> has
its Name from a Stock or Log of Wood,
which three Brothers threw into the Water
five Miles above the City, making a Vow,
that where-ever that Stock should stop, they
would build a Castle to dwell in. The Stock
stopt at the Holm, or Rock where the Pa∣lace
of the King now stands: And the Bro∣thers,
to be as good as their word, there
built their Castle, which invited others to do
the like; so that in process of time the other
Rocks or Holms were covered with Build∣ings,
which at length became the Capital
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
City of the Kingdom. It is now embelished
with a great many stately Houses, and much
improved from what it was 400 Years ago,
as indeed most Cities are; for the Stadthouse
then built, is so contemptible and low, that in
<HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>England</HI> it would not be suffered
to stand to disgrace the Nation. The Coun∣cil-Chamber
where the Burghmasters and
Raedt sit, is two Rooms cast into one, not
above nine Foot high; and the two Rooms
where the Sheriffs and the Erve College
(which is a Judicature like to the Doctors
Commons in <HI>England)</HI> sit, are not above
eight Foot and a half high. The King's Pa∣lace
is a large Square of Stone-building, in
some places very high, but an old and irre∣gular
Fabrick, without a sufficient quantity
of Ground about it for Gardens and Walks.
It was anciently surrounded with Water; but
some Years since part of it was filled up to
make a Way from the Castle-Gate down in∣to
the old Town. In this Palace there are
large Rooms; but the Lodgings of the King,
Queen, and Royal Family, are three Pair of
Stairs high, the Rooms in the first and se∣cond
Stories being destin'd for the Senate-Chamber,
and other Courts of Judicature.
The King's Library is four Pair of Stairs
high, being a Room about forty six Foot
square, with a Closet adjoyning to it not
half the Dimensions. When I considered
the Apartments and Furniture of this Court,
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>
I began to think that the French Author
wrote Truth, who in his Remarks upon
<HI>Swedeland</HI> says, That when Queen <HI>Christina</HI>
resigned the Crown to <HI>Carolus Gustavus,</HI> the
Father of this present King, she disposed of
the best of the Furniture of the Court, and
gave away a large share of the Crown-Lands
to her Favorites; in so much that the King,
considering the poor Condition she had left
the Kingdom in, and seeing the Court so
meanly furnished, said, That had he known
before he accepted the Crown, what then
he did, he would have taken other Mea∣sures.</P>
<P>There are many other stately Palaces in
<HI>Stockholm</HI> belonging to the Nobility; but
many of them for want of Repairs, and not
being inhabited, run to ruine; several of the
Nobles who lived in them formerly, having
lost the Estates that maintained their ancient
Splendor, as we shall see hereafter, being
retired unto a Country Life. There are al∣so
some other Magnificent Structures begun,
but not finished, as that stately Building in∣tended
for a Parliament-House for the No∣bles,
and two or three Churches: But what
I most wonder at, is the Vault wherein the
late King lies buried, is not as yet covered
but with Boards, for it is to be observed that
the Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> have no Tombs and Mo∣numents
as in <HI>England</HI> and other Countries;
but are put into Copper Coffins, with In∣scriptions
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>
on them, and placed one by ano∣ther
in Vaults, adjoyning to the Gray-Friers
Church. These Vaults are about eight in
Number, having Turrets over them, with
Veins of Copper gilt, carved into the Cy∣phers
of the several Kings who give them
their Names by being the first that are inter∣red
in them. The Vault of the late King is
not yet finished, no more than the Fabricks
above-mentioned, which perhaps may be
imputed to the late Troubles of <HI>Swedeland.</HI>
The Number of the Inhabitants of <HI>Stockholm</HI>
are also much decreased within these few
Years, partly by reason of the removal of
the Court of Admiralty and the Kings Ships
from that City to <HI>Charles-Crown,</HI> a new Ha∣ven
lately made about 200 English Miles
from thence, which hath drawn many Fa∣milies
belonging to the Fleet and Admiralty
from <HI>Stockholm</HI> to live there: And partly,
because many of the Nobility, Gentry, and
those that depended on them, are, as I said
before, withdrawn from <HI>Stockholm</HI> to a re∣tired
Life in the Country. Nevertheless the
ordinary sort of Burghers, who still remain,
are extreamly poor; seeing the Women are
fain to work like Horses, drawing Carts, and
as Labourers in <HI>England,</HI> serving Masons and
Bricklayers with Stone, Bricks and Mortar,
and unloading Vessels that bring those Mate∣rials;
some of the poor Creatures in the
Summer-time toiling in their Smocks with∣out
<PB N="122" REF="66"/>
either Shooes or Stockings. They per∣form
also the part of Watermen, and for a
small matter will Row Passengers 40 Miles
or more if they please.</P>
<P>The Court here is very thin and silent,
the King living frugally, and seldom Dining
in publick. He Eats commonly with the
two Queens, his Mother and Consort, who
is a Virtuous Princess, Sister to the King of
<HI>Denmark.</HI> She is the Mother of five Chil∣dren,
three Sons and two Daughters, with
whom she spends most of her time in Re∣tirement.
The King is a goodly Prince,
whom God hath Blessed and Endowed with
Accomplishments far beyond what might
have been expected from his Education,
wherein he was extreamly abused, being
Taught little more than his Mother Tongue.
He is Gracious, Just and Valiant, constant
at his Devotion, and utterly averse from all
kind of Debauchery, and the unfashionable
Vanities of other Courts, in Plays and
Dancing.</P>
<P>His sports are Hunting and Exercising of
his Guards, and he rarely appears publickly,
or gives Audience to Strangers, which is
imputed to his Sense of the neglect of his
Education. He is a Prince that hath had a
very hard beginning in the World, which
hath many times proved fortunate to great
Men; and indeed, if we consider all the
circumstances of his early Misfortunes, how
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
he was slighted and neglected by his Nobles,
who would hardly vouchsafe to pay him a
visit when he was among them in the Coun∣try,
or to do him Homage for the Lands
they held of the Crown; and how by the
pernicious Counsels of the French, and the
weakness or treachery of his Governors, he
was misled into a War that almost cost him
his Crown, having lost the best of his Ter∣ritories
in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Schonen,</HI> and most of
his Forces both by Sea and Land: If, I say,
these things be considered, it will probably
appear, that hardly any Prince before him
hath in a shorter time, or more fully setled
the Authority and Prerogative of the Crown,
than he hath done in <HI>Sweden;</HI> for which he
stands no ways obliged to <HI>France,</HI> as he was
for the Restauration of what he lost during
the War. He is now as absolute as the French
King, and makes Edicts, which have the
Force of Laws, without the concurrence of
the Estates of the Kingdom. He hath erected
two Judicatures, the one called the College
of Reduction, and the other of Inspections;
the first of which hath put his Majesty in
Possession again of all Lands alienated from
the Crown, and the other called to account
all Persons, even the Heirs and Executors of
those who had cheated the Crown, and
made them refund what they or their Prede∣cessors
had appropriated to their own use of
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>
the publick Revenue. These two necessary
Constitutions, as they have reduced many
great Families to a pinch, who formerly
lived splendidly upon the Crown Lands and
Revenues, and obliged them to live at home
upon their ancient and private Patrimony in
the Country, which is one great cause that
the Court of <HI>Sweden</HI> is at present so unfre∣quented;
so have they enabled his Majesty;
without burdening of his Subjects, to support
the Charges of the Government, and to
maintain 64000 Men in pay. The Truth is,
his other Revenues are but small, what a∣rises
from the Copper and Iron Mines, one
Silver Mine, the Pitch and Tar, the Cu∣stoms
and Excise amounts to no extraordi∣nary
Sum of Money, and the Land Tax in
so barren a Country scarcely deserving to be
named. The Customes and Excise, I con∣fess,
are very high, and the rigorous manner
of exacting them pernicious to Trade: As for
instance; If a Ship come to <HI>Stockholme</HI> from
<HI>London,</HI> with a hundred several sorts of Goods,
and those Goods assigned to fifty several
Men more or less, if any of those fifty do
not pay the Custom of what belongs to him,
though it be for a Barrel of Beer, the Ship
shall not be unladen, nor no Man have his
Goods out, though he hath fully pay'd the
Customs for them, till this last Man hath
pay'd his. There are several other silly
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>
Customs in <HI>Swedeland</HI> that discourages Men
from Trading there; as if any Stranger Die
there, a third of his Estate must go to the
City or Town where he Traded. No Fo∣reign
Merchant in <HI>Stockholme</HI> can Travel in∣to
any Country where there is a Fair with∣out
a Passport: And at present, seeing there
is no Treaty of Trade betwixt <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Sweden,</HI> though the English bring as conside∣rable
a Trade to that Kingdom as any other
Country whatsoever, yet they are very un∣kindly
used by the Officers of the Custom-House;
whereas the Dutch in <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and
other Cities, have new and greater Privi∣leges
allowed them. Nor would I Counsel
an English-man to go to Law with a Swedish
Burgher in <HI>Sweden,</HI> especially if he be a
Whiggish Scot, who hath got his Freedom
in <HI>Stockholme,</HI> for those are a kind of Scrapers,
whom I have observed to be more inveterate
against the English than the Native Swedes.</P>
<P>Of all the Swedish Army of 64000 Men,
the King keeps but 12 Companies of 200
Men a-peice, with some few Horse Guards
in <HI>Stockholme,</HI> who are not upon Duty as
Sentinels at the Court Gates, as at the Courts
of other Princes. The rest are dispersed in∣to
Quarters and Garisons upon the Frontiers,
which are so far distant in that large compass
of Land which his Territories take up, that
it would require a hard and tedious work to
bring them together to a general Muster.
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>
They are however kept under very strict
Discipline, and those that lie near, often
viewed by the King. They have odd sort,
of Punishments for the Soldiers and Officers
of all Degrees: For Example, if a Serjeant
or Corporal be Drunk, or negligent on Du∣ty,
they are put into Armour, and with three
Muskets tied under each Arm, made to walk
two Hours before the Court of Guard; yet,
for all the severity of Discipline used against
the Soldiers, they commit many Abuses in
the Night time, Robbing, and sometimes
killing Men upon the Streets in <HI>Stockholme,</HI>
where they have no Lights nor Guards as in
<HI>Copenhagen.</HI> In former times there have
been at one time 35 Colonels, besides Ge∣neral
Officers in the Swedish Army, all the
Subjects of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> but
at present there are few or none, unless it
be the Sons of some Scotish Officers De∣ceased;
nor did I ever see an English-Man
in the Kings Guards, Horse or Foot, but
one, and the Son of Sir <HI>Edward Wood,</HI> who
hath since quitted the Service. The King
hath exceedingly won the Hearts of the
common People, not only by exempting
them from the Tyrannical jurisdiction of the
Nobility and Gentry, who formerly would
by their own private Authority, punish and
put to Death the Peasants at their pleasure,
which makes the Countries very willing to
Quarter the Kings Soldiers, but by his exact∣ness
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>
in punishing Duels, Murder, and Rob∣beries.
Perjury is Death here also, as in
<HI>Holland,</HI> which makes the Magistrates in some
parts of this Kings Territories, enjoyn strange
kinds of Oaths to deter Men from being for∣sworn:
As for instance, in some places the
Witness is set with a Staff in his Hand upon
some Peeble Stones and Charcoal, where he
is to imprecate and pray, that if what he
Sweareth be not true, his Land may become
as barren as those Stones, and his Substance
be Consumed to Ashes like the Coals he stands
on, which as soon as he steps down are set
on Fire. This manner of Swearing so ter∣rifies
the People, that they commonly trem∣ble
when they come to take their Oath.</P>
<P>The Religion of the Dominions of the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as of those of the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> and of other Princes and States
whom we have named, is Lutheran, who are
more rigid to Roman Catholicks and Calvi∣nists
than the Protestants of <HI>Germany.</HI> There
is no Toleration allowed here to Calvinist
Ministers; and they take an effectual course
to keep the Country clear of Priests and Je∣suits,
by Guelding them, whether they be
young or old. In Commemoration of the
great Losses and Desolation sustained in the
late War, the Suedes strictly keep four Fasting
Days in the Months of <HI>April, May, June,</HI>
and <HI>July;</HI> on which days all Men are pro∣hibited
by Authority to kindle Fire in their
<PB N="128" REF="69"/>
Houses, or to Eat till after Evening Service
is done, which in the Winter time could not
be endured. They delight much in Singing
in their Churches, which they constantly
perform twice every day, Morning and
Evening. In their Marryings, Christenings,
and Buryings they are so prodigally extrava∣gant,
that if all three happen in one year to
a Man of a competent Estate, it is enough
to break him. The Clergy of <HI>Sweden</HI> are
neither so Rich nor Learned as those of
<HI>Germany,</HI> wanting both the opportunities of
Study, and of conversing with Learned Men,
that those of other Countrys enjoy, though
there be some Learned Men amongst them.
A Bishoprick in <HI>Sweden</HI> is no great Benefice,
if compared with some Parsonages in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
for the Arch-bishop, and Metropolitan
hath not above 400 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and some
of the rest are not worth above 150 or 200 <HI>l.</HI>
a year. The inferiour Clergy are not so
regular in their Lives and Conversation in the
Countries distant from <HI>Stockholme,</HI> as they are
near the Court; and the Reason is, partly
because they entertain Travellers that pass the
Country, there being no Inns in most places
for the Accommodation of Persons of any
Quality, and so are obliged to drink with
their Guests; and partly, because at Buryings
and Christenings, where there is commonly
high Drinking, the Pape or Parson is Master
of the Ceremonies: And here give me leave
<PB N="129" REF="69"/>
to tell a short Story of one of them. A Pape
coming to Christen a Child in a Church,
and finding a Scotch Man to be Godfather,
was so transported either with Zeal, or his
Cups, that when he came to exorcise the
Child, which is a Rite used in their Office of
Administring this Sacrament; he neglected
the Form prescribed by the Liturgy, and in
an extemporary Prayer begg'd, that the Devil
might depart out of the Child, and enter
into that Scottish Heretick, for so they call
the Presbyterians of that Nation. The Prayer
of the Pape so incensed the Scot, that he
vowed Revenge, and watched the Pape with
a good Cudgel next day as he crossed the
Church-yard, where he beat him, and left
him all in Blood lying on the Ground, and
crying out Murder. For this Fact the Scot
was had before the Justice, who asking him,
How he durst be so bold as to lay his profane
Hands upon the Man of God? He, who
knew very well what use to make of the De∣vil
he had got, Foaming at the Mouth, and
cunningly acting the Demoniack, made an∣swer,
That the Pape might thank himself
for what he had met with; for since he had
Conjured the Devil into him he spared no
Body, neither Wife nor Children, nor would
he spare the Justice himself, and with that
fell a mangling and tearing the Magistrate,
that he was fain to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take himself to his
Heels, crying out <HI>O! the Devil, save me;</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>
and so the Scot marched home, no Man da∣ring
to lay hold on him, for fear of being
torn to pieces by the Devil. But the Justice
recollecting himself, sent for the Pape, told
him, That the Scot was a cunning Rogue,
and bid him go home, get a Plaister for his
Head, and be silent, lest if the matter came
to the Bishops Ears he might be Censured for
going against the Rubrick of the Liturgy.</P>
<P>The Famous University where their Clergy
are bred, is <HI>Upsal,</HI> 8 Swedish Miles from
<HI>Stockholme.</HI> There are commonly 150, or
200 Students there, but no Endowed Col∣leges,
as in other Countries. The Library
is so mean and contemptible, that the Li∣braries
of many Grammar Schools, and of
private Men in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> are far
better stored with Books than it is. Upon
viewing of it, and that of the Kings Palace,
I called to mind the saying of a French Man,
upon the like occasion; That <HI>Swedeland</HI>
came behind <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in the know∣ledge
of Men and Things at least 800 years;
yet some Swedes have been so conceited of
the Antiquity of their Country, as to brag,
that Paradice was seated in <HI>Sweden;</HI> that the
Country was turned into such heaps of Rocks
for the Rebellion of our first Parents, and that
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> in a Coun∣try
three Swedish Miles distant from <HI>Upsall.</HI>
A French Man standing by, and hearing this
Romantick Story, as I was told, fitted him
<PB N="131" REF="70"/>
with the like, telling him, that when the
World was made in six days, at the end of
the Creation all the Rubbish that remained
was thrown together into a Corner, which
made up <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Norway.</HI> And indeed,
the French seem to have no great liking to
the Country, whatever kindness they may
have for the People; for a French Ambassa∣dor,
as an Author of that Country relates,
being by order of Queen <HI>Christina,</HI> Treated
in a Country House four Swedish Miles from
<HI>Stockholme,</HI> and upon the rode going and
coming, with all the Varieties and Pleasures
that the Country could afford, on purpose
to make him have a good Opinion of the
same; made answer to the Queen, (who
asked him upon his return, What he thought
of <HI>Sweden)</HI> That were he Master of the
whole Country, he would presently Sell it,
and Buy a Farm in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England;</HI> which,
under Favour, I think was a little Tart and
Sawcy.</P>
<P>Having stayed a considerable time in
<HI>Swedeland,</HI> and most part at <HI>Stockholme,</HI> I set
out from thence to go to <HI>Elsenbourg</HI> by Land,
and went a little out of my way to see a
small City called <HI>Eubrone,</HI> Famous for a Coat
of Arms which it got in this manner. A
certain Masculine Queen of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who
had Conquered a great part of <HI>Sweden,</HI> com∣ing
to this City, asked the Magistrates, What
was the Arms of their City? Who having
<PB N="132" REF="71"/>
her, that they had none, she plucked up her
Coats, and squatting upon the Snow, bid
them take the mark she left there for their
Arms; its pity she did not give them a sui∣table
Motto to it also: What that Figure is
called in Blazonery I know not, but to this
Day the City uses it in their Arms, and for
marking their Commodities. This Queen
came purposely into <HI>Sweden,</HI> to pay a visit
to a brave Woman, that opposed a King of
<HI>Swedeland,</HI> who in a time of Famine would
have put to Death all the Men and Women
in his Country above 60 years of Age. The
Country all the way I travelled in <HI>Swedeland</HI>
is much of the same quality of the Land a∣bout
<HI>Stockholme,</HI> until I came near the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Schonen,</HI> which is called the Store-house,
and Kitchin of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where the
Country is far better. It was formerly very
dangerous to Travel in this Province of
<HI>Schonen,</HI> because of the Snaphances, who
were a kind of Bloody Robbers, now utter∣ly
destroyed by the King; so that it is safe
enough Travelling there. Entering into
<HI>Schonen</HI> I saw 29 of these Rogues upon
Wheels, and elsewhere in the Country, ten
and twenty at several places. The King used
great severity in destroying of them; some
he caused to be broken upon the Wheel, o∣thers
Spitted in at the Fundament, and out
at the Shoulders, many had the Flesh pinched
off of their Breasts, and so were fastened to
<PB N="133" REF="71"/>
Stakes till they Died; and others again had
their Noses and both Hands cut off, and be∣ing
seared with a hot Iron, were let go to
acquaint their Comrades how they had been
served. The King is very severe against High∣way-Men
and Duellers. In above a 100 Miles
Travelling, we found not a House where there
was either French Wine or Brandy, which made
me tell a Swede of our Company, who was
Travelling to <HI>Denmark,</HI> that I would under∣take
to shew any Man 500 Houses, wherein
a Traveller might have Wine, and other good
Accommodation in the space of an Hundred
Miles upon any rode from <HI>London.</HI> There
are several small Towns and fertile Land in
this Country of <HI>Schonen,</HI> lying upon the
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undt;</HI> at the narrowest part whereof lies
<HI>Elsenbourg</HI> burnt down by the Danes in the
last War: Here I crost over to <HI>Elsenore,</HI> the
passage being but a League broad.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has a Castle at <HI>El∣senore,</HI>
which commands the narrow passage
of the <HI>Soundt,</HI> where all Ships that enter in∣to,
or come out of the Baltick Sea must pay
Toll. Having visited this Castle, and staid
about a Fortnight with the English Consul,
and Sir <HI>John Paul,</HI> late Resident at the Court
of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> I went to the Danish Court
at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>COpenhagen</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Zec∣land,
Jutland,</HI> or <HI>Denmark,</HI> and place
of Residence of the King: It stands on a
<PB N="134" REF="72"/>
Flat, encompassed with a pleasant and de∣lightful
Country, much resembling <HI>England.</HI>
The Streets of the City are kept very neat and
clean, with Lights in the Night time for the
convenience and safety of those who are then
abroad; a Custom not as yet introduced
into <HI>Stockholme,</HI> where it is dangerous
to be abroad when it is dark. The Kings
Men of War lie hear very conveniently, be∣ing
orderly ranged betwixt Booms, after the
manner of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and near the Admi∣ralty
House, which is a large pile of Building,
well furnished with Stores and Magazins, se∣cured
by a Cittadel, that not only commands
the City, but also the Haven, and entry in∣to
it. The Court of <HI>Denmark</HI> is splendid,
and makes a far greater figure in the World
than that of <HI>Sweden,</HI> though not many years
ago, in the time of <HI>Carolus Gustavus</HI> the Fa∣ther
of the present King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> it was
almost reduced to its last, when the Walls of
<HI>Copenhagen</HI> saved that Crown and Kingdom.
That Siege was Famous, carried on with great
vigour by the Swede, and as bravely main∣tained
by the Danes: The Monuments
whereof are to be seen in the Cannon Bullets
gilt that still remain in the Walls of some
Houses, and in the Steeple of the great Church
of the Town. The Royal Palace in <HI>Copen∣hagen</HI>
is but small, and a very ancient Build∣ing;
but his Majesties House <HI>Fredenburg</HI> is a
stately Fabrick of Modern Architecture, and
<PB N="135" REF="72"/>
very richly Furnished. <HI>Denmark</HI> is at pre∣sent
a flourishing Kingdom, and the King,
who hath now made it Hereditary, surpasses
most of his Predecessors in Power and
Wealth: He hath much enlarged his Domi∣nions,
as well as Authority; and by his Per∣sonal
and Royal Virtues, no less than the e∣minent
qualities of a great many able Mini∣sters
of State, he hath gained the Universal
Love of his Subjects, and the esteem of all
Foreign Princes and States. The Court is
much frequented every day, but especially
on Sundays, where about Eleven of the Clock
in the Morning, the Nobility, Foreign Mi∣nisters,
and Officers of the Army assemble,
and make a glorious Appearance. There
one may see many Knights of the Order of
the Elephant of <HI>Malto;</HI> but I never saw any
Order of the like Nature as that of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
that King rarely appearing in his George and
Garter; but on days of publick Audience I
have observed at one time above 150 Coaches
attending at the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which
are ten times more than ever I saw together
at that of <HI>Sweden.</HI> The King is affable, and
of easie access to Strangers, seen often abroad
by his Subjects in his Gardens and Stables,
which are very large, and well furnished
with all sorts of Horses. He is a great lover
of English Horses and Dogs, and delights
much in Hunting, as his Eldest Son the Prince,
with his Brothers do in Cock-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighting; inso∣much
<PB N="136" REF="73"/>
much, that the English Merchants cannot
make a more acceptable present to those
Princes, than of English Game-Cocks. The
standing Forces of <HI>Denmark</HI> are well disci∣plined
Men, and Commanded by good
Officers, both Natives and Strangers, both
French and Scots, as Major General <HI>Duncan,</HI>
and Major General <HI>Veldun,</HI> both Scottish-Men,
whom I saw at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> The Soldiers as
well as Courtiers are quartered upon the Ci∣tizens,
a Custom which is likewise practised
in <HI>Sweden,</HI> and tho' somewhat uneasie, yet
not repined at by the People, who by the
care and good Government of the King,
find Trade much advanced. For his Ma∣jesty
by encouraging Strangers of all Reli∣gions
to live in his Dominions, and allowing
the French and Dutch Calvinists, to have
publick Churches, hath brought many Tra∣ding
Families to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and by the
measure he hath taken for setling Trade in
prohibiting the Importation of Foreign Ma∣nufactures,
and Reforming and new Model∣ling
the East and West <HI>India</HI> Companies, hath
much encreased Commerce, and thereby
the Wealth of his Subjects; so that notwith∣standing
the new Taxes imposed upon all
Coaches, Wagons, Ploughs, and all real and
personal Estates, which amount to conside∣rable
Sums of Money; the People live very
well and contented. There are commonly
about 8000 Men in Garison in <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and
<PB N="137" REF="73"/>
his Majesties Regiment of Foot Guards, who
are all Cloathed in Red, with Cloaks to keep
them warm in the Winter time, is a very hand∣some
Body of Men; and with the Horse
Guards, who are bravely mounted, and have
their Granadeers and Hautboys, make a very
fine shew. His Majesty hath caused several
new Fortifications to be built upon the <HI>Elb,</HI>
and other Rivers, and hath now in his Pos∣session,
that strong Castle called <HI>Hilgueland,</HI>
at present commanded by a Scottish-man. The
Queen of <HI>Denmark</HI> is a most virtuous Prin∣cess,
Sister to the present Landtgrave of <HI>Hesse
Cassel,</HI> and in Perswasion a Calvinist, ha∣ving
a Chapel allowed her within the Court,
though the publick Religion of the King and
Kingdom be Lutheran. The Clergy here are
Learned, many of them having studied at
<HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where they learnt the
English Language; and amongst the Bishops
there is one Doctor <HI>King</HI> the Son of a Scot∣tish-man.
But seeing it is my design rather
to observe the condition of the People, than
to be punctual in describing all the Rarities that
are remarkable in the Countries I have been
in, I shall conclude what I have to say of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
by acquainted the Reader that the Peo∣ple
of that Country live far better than the
Swedes, and as well as most of their adjoyning
Neighbours; and that there are several places,
both there, and in <HI>Norway,</HI> which have the
Names of English Towns, as <HI>Arundale, Tot∣ness,
London,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="74"/>
When I first began to write this Trea∣tise,
I had some thoughts of making Obser∣vations
upon the several Governments of
other States and Dominions, where I had
travelled some years before I was in the
Countries I have been speaking of, as of the
rest of <HI>Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy,</HI>
and <HI>France;</HI> but that was a Subject so large,
and the usefulness of it to my present De∣sign
so inconsiderable, that by doing so, I
found I could neither satisfie the Curious, by
adding any thing material to those many
who have already obliged the Publick by
the Remarks of their Travels in those Pla∣ces;
or make my discontented Country∣men
more averse than they are already from
removing into those Countries, where I
think few of them will chuse to transport
themselves for the sake of Liberty and Pro∣perty,
though <HI>England</HI> were even worse than
they themselves fancy it can be. All that
remains to be done then, is to conclude this
Treatise with an obvious and popular Re∣mark,
that those Countries, where Cities
are greatest and most frequented by volun∣tary
Inhabitants, are always the best to live
in; and by comparing the City of <HI>London</HI>
with all other Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> and demon∣strating
by the Surveys I have made, (which
I think will hardly be contradicted or con∣futed)
that of all the Capital Cities of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
it is the biggest and most populous, and
<PB N="139" REF="74"/>
so prove consequentially that <HI>England,</HI> for
the generality of People, is the best Coun∣try
in the World, especially for its Natives,
to live in. Now this being an Observation
(for what I know) not hitherto made good
by Induction and Instance, (as I intend to
do it) I hope it will please the Reader as
much, as if I gave him a particular account
of other Countries and Governments, and
leave it to his own Reflection to state the
Comparison.</P>
<P>Though <HI>London</HI> within the Walls cannot
vye for bigness with many Cities of <HI>Europe;</HI>
yet take the City and Suburbs together, ac∣cording
as it hath been survey'd by Mr. <HI>Mor∣gan,</HI>
in breadth from St. <HI>George</HI>'s Church in
<HI>Southwark</HI> to <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> and in length from
<HI>Limehouse</HI> to <HI>Petty-France</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> and
it is in a vast proportion larger in compass
of Ground, and number of Houses, than
any City in <HI>Europe</HI> whatsoever. This I shall
demonstrate first, by comparing it with
some Cities of <HI>Holland,</HI> and then with the
most considerable Cities of the other Coun∣tries
of <HI>Europe,</HI> which I shall set down in an
Alphabetical Order, with the number of the
Houses they severally contain.</P>
<P>When <HI>London</HI> and Suburbs was surveyed
some years ago by Mr. <HI>Morgan,</HI> there were
reckoned to be in it 84000 Houses, besides
Hospitals, Alms-houses, and other Buildings,
that paid no Chimney-money to the King:
<PB N="140" REF="75"/>
Now if those were added, and the vast
number of new Houses that have been built
since that Survey, upon modest computa∣tion
<HI>London</HI> may be reckoned to contain
100000 Houses; nay, 'tis believed 120000,
which truly considering the extraordinary
Additions that have been made lately, is not
improbable; I know the <HI>French</HI> vapour, and
would perswade the World, that <HI>Paris</HI> is
much bigger than <HI>London.</HI> And the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI>
will scarce believe, that <HI>London</HI> hath
more Houses than the 18 Cities in <HI>Holland</HI>
that have Voices in the States, for (say they)
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> stands upon 1000 Morgans of
Land, and <HI>London</HI> stands but upon 1800.
To both which I answer, That it is very
true that <HI>Paris</HI> takes up a great spot of
Ground, but then you must consider, that in
<HI>Paris</HI> there are several hundreds of Mona∣steries,
Churches, Colleges, and Cloisters,
some of them having large Gardens, and
that in <HI>Paris</HI> there are 7500 Palaces and
Ports for Coaches, which have likewise great
Gardens; whereas <HI>London</HI> is very thick built,
and in the City the Houses have scarce a
Yard big enough to set a Pump or House of
Conveniency in; but the Weekly Bills of
Mortality will decide this Question, and
plainly give it to <HI>London,</HI> and so doth Mon∣sieur
<HI>la Cour,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> in his last
Essays dedicated to the King, making it ap∣pear,
that <HI>London</HI> is bigger than <HI>Paris, Roan,</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="75"/>
and <HI>Rochel</HI> altogether; and as for <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI>
I do appeal to all knowing Men that
have seen it, that although it be true, that
it stands upon 1000 Morgans of Land, yet
there is not above 400 Morgans built; and
this I prove thus, that the large Gardens,
on the <HI>Heeregraft, Kysersgraft,</HI> and <HI>Princegraft,</HI>
and the Burghwalls of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> take up more
than a third part of the City; then reckon the
Bastions, and the space of Ground between
the Wall and the Houses, and all the Ground
unbuilt from the <HI>Utricks-Port</HI> to the <HI>Wesoper-Port,
Muyer-Port,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Seaside, and
you will find it to be near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Morgans</HI> of Land:
There are two Parishes in the Suburbs of
<HI>London,</HI> viz. <HI>Stepney,</HI> and <HI>St. Martins in the
Fields,</HI> (the latter being so big, that the
Parliament divided it into four Parishes) ei∣ther
of them have more Houses than <HI>Rotter∣dam</HI>
or <HI>Haerlem;</HI> and there are several other
great Parishes, as St. <HI>Margarets Westminster,
St. Giles in the Fields, St. Olaves,</HI> and <HI>St. Mary
Saviours,</HI> the which if they stood apart in the
Country would make great Cities; we reck∣on
in <HI>London,</HI> and the Suburbs thereof to be
at least 130 Parishes, which contains 100000
Houses; now if you reckon 8 Persons to e∣very
House, then there are near 800000
Souls in <HI>London,</HI> but there are some that say,
there is a Million of Souls in it: I shall now
set down the Cities Alphabetically, and their
number of Houses, as they were given to
<PB N="142" REF="76"/>
me not only from the Surveyors and City
Carpenters, but from the Books of the Hearth-Money,
and Collectors of the several Taxes
in the respective Cities: And first I shall be∣gin
with the 18 Cities that have Voices in
the States of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN
Exact Relation
Of the ENTERTAINMENT of His
Most Sacred Majesty,
WILLIAM III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">At the HAGƲE.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesty being earnestly En∣treated
by the States of <HI>Holland,</HI>
and the Confederate Princes in
<HI>Germany, &amp;c.</HI> to meet at a General Congress,
to be held at the <HI>Hague,</HI> in order to Concert
matters for the next Campaign, was pleased
to Condescend to their Request, and hazard
His Royal Person by Sea, (though in the
depth of Winter) His Noble Zeal for the
Good of us in particular, and <HI>Europe</HI> in
general, surmounting all those Difficulties:
Whereupon he accordingly took Shipping
<PB N="2" REF="81"/>
on the Sixteenth of <HI>January 1690-91.</HI> in a
Yacht, then lying at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and set Sail
that Afternoon, being attended by divers
Yatchts and Men of War, and a Noble Re∣tinue
of Persons of the best Quality; but by
Reason of the very thick Mists, and conse∣quently
little Wind, was four days before he
could make the Coast of <HI>Holland;</HI> yet, at last,
when he arrived within two or three
Leagues of <HI>Goree,</HI> His Majesty ventured to
go a Shoar in the Boat, attended by the
Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and
my Lord <HI>Overkirke, &amp;c.</HI> and another Boat, but
most unfortunately there fell so thick a Fog,
and the Ice surrounded them so closely, that
neither could they make the Shoar, nor get
back to the Ship, but were forc'd to lie still
for two and twenty Hours, enduring the
most bitter Cold, and without (almost)
hopes of ever getting alive on Shoar: All
which, His Majesty bore with His wanted
Magnanimity and Courage, and when one
of the Boat-men too freely expressed his Fear
of Death, he reproved him with this Noble
saying, <HI>What are you afraid to Die in my Com∣pany.</HI>
But it pleased the Almighty Provi∣dence,
at length to dissipate the Mist, and
Conduct His Royal Majesty safely to the
Shoar, and on the 21st of <HI>January,</HI> about
half an hour after Ten, landed at the <HI>Orange
Polder,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Maese,</HI> a little
below <HI>Maseland-Sluyce,</HI> but by the long con∣tinuance

<PB N="3" REF="83"/>
in the Cold, was so Benummed,
that he could hardly either stand or Speak.
From hence His Majesty went immediately
to the House of the Heer Van <HI>Rynenbergh,</HI>
where having refreshed Himself, and Dined,
He hasted to <HI>Hounslaerdyke,</HI> where He was
met, and Congratulated with all Demon∣strations
of Respects and Joy, by the Depu∣ties
of the States; as also by Prince <HI>Casimir</HI>
of <HI>Nassau,</HI> Stadtholder of <HI>Friezeland,</HI> whom
His Majesty received with all the Marks of
the most tender Affection imaginable, Em∣bracing
and Kissing them with great Ar∣dency.
Prince <HI>Nassau Sarbruggen,</HI> the Count
Van <HI>Hoorn,</HI> and divers other Persons of Qua∣tity,
here likewise Congratulated His Maje∣sties
happy arrival, who were all most
kindly received by His Majesty.</P>
<P>'Twas expected that the King would have
lain here this Night, and so have entred the
<HI>Hague</HI> by day light; but on the contrary,
His extraordinary Desire of entring imme∣diately
upon Business, would not let Him
give Himself so much as one Nights ease;
And His Majesty, after a very short Refresh∣ment
here, departed for the <HI>Hague,</HI> attended
with five or six Coaches with six Horses:
In His own Coach accompanied Him the
Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Overkirk,</HI>
arriving at the <HI>Hague</HI> about half an hour after
five in the Evening; where (though he was
not that Night expected) there wanted not
<PB N="4" REF="84"/>
the general Acclamations of the People of all
sorts, who run by His Coach, crying out,
<HI>Long Live King</HI> William, <HI>Welcom, Welcom,
&amp;c.</HI> His Majesty Rode through the Trium∣phant
Arches, Erected by the Lords of the
<HI>Hague,</HI> and the Honourable the Lords Com∣mittee
of the Council of <HI>Holland,</HI> (of which
we shall give an exact Description in their
proper Places) directly to the Court, where
being arrived, and the Gates shut to keep
out the extraordinary press of People, thirty
peices of Cannon, which were planted up∣on
the <HI>Vyverberg,</HI> were thrice discharged,
Publick Thanksgivings were made in all the
Churches, and the Bells rung with great
Joy; and throughout the Town almost all
the Houses were Illuminated with great
numbers of Candles in their Windows,
whilst all the People, Rich and Poor, Old
and Young, made all Demonstrations of
their inexpressible Joy for His Majesties
most happy Arrival.</P>
<P>That Evening the Earl of <HI>Berka,</HI> Envoy
Extraordinary from the Emperor, waited
upon His Majesty, and was a long time in
private with Him; and the next day several
Members of the States, and divers Persons
of Quality came to Compliment His Maje∣sty,
and Congratulate His Arrival.</P>
<P>The Ministers of the several Confederate
Princes, who upon the Kings arrival had
sent Expresses to their respective Masters,
<PB N="5" REF="84"/>
assembling themselves in Congress; imme∣diately
after their breaking up, the Imperial,
Spanish, and Brandenburgh Envoys, came
to wait upon His Majesty; as also the
Council of State, and the Lords of the Ge∣neral
Accounts, with all their Members, to
Congratulate and Complement Him.</P>
<P>The King immediately applied Himself
to the Affairs of State, and taking first into
His Consideration the Sea Affairs, gave the
Command of the Dutch Fleet to the Heer
<HI>Cornelius</HI> Van <HI>Tromp,</HI> with the Title of Vice-Admiral
of <HI>Holland,</HI> who gratefully accep∣ted
the same, and immediately beat up his
Drums for Seamen, who flocked to him in
great abundance. His Majesty gave also out
Commissions for two Regiments of <HI>Mariners</HI>
to be raised.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who had
waited some time at <HI>Cleave,</HI> as soon as he
received advice of His Majesties arrival, set
forward for the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time it was Desired, and
Agreed to by His Majesty, That His Ma∣jesty
would Please to Honour the <HI>Hague</HI>
with a Publick Entry, on <HI>Monday, January</HI>
the 26th: Whereupon the Trained Bands,
and the Guards were ordered to be ready;
And accordingly on <HI>Monday,</HI> at two of the
Clock in the Afternoon, His Majesty went
out of the Town by the way of the <HI>Vyver∣berg,</HI>
to the North-end, and from thence
<PB N="6" REF="85"/>
round the Wall to the West-end, and so to
the <HI>Hounslaerdyke,</HI> or <HI>Loosduyn</HI>'s-bridge, where
began the Triumph. Over this Bridge was
Erected, by the Burghermasters of the
<HI>Hague,</HI> a Triumphant Arch, the Figure
whereof we have here Represented. Over
the Arch in the Front, is a Man and a
Woman standing at an Altar Sacrificing,
with the Words, <HI>Io Triumphe.</HI> On the top
of all stands the Statue of His Majesty, with
a Staff in His right Hand, at the top of
which is a Cypher of His Name, with a
Crown. On the two Columns of the Arch,
on one side are these Words,
<Q><P>Ob Cives Servatos: For having preserved
his Country-men.</P>
<P>Ob Hostes Fugatos: For having destroyed
his Enemies.</P></Q>
and on the other side,
<Q><P>Restitutis Provinciis: The Provinces being
Restored.</P>
<P>Libertatis Regnis: The Kingdoms being
Delivered.</P></Q></P>
<P>Behind each Column is a small Oval, in
one a Lawrel with this Word,
<Q>Victoria, Victory,</Q>
on the other a Palm, with the Word,
<Q>Clementia, Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>Here His Majesty was received by the
Magistrates of the <HI>Hague,</HI> who Complimen∣ted
<PB REF="85"/>
<PB REF="86"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>Kings Entertainment Pag:6</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="87"/>
<PB N="7" REF="87"/>
Him, and Congratulated His Arrival,
the Pensionary <HI>Vander Hoeck</HI> being their
Speaker, who humbly Thanked the King
in the Name of the Magistrates and Burg∣hers,
for the Honour His Majesty was plea∣sed
to do them by His Presence, in a most
Eloquent Oration.</P>
<P>From hence was a Lane made on each
side by the Burghers in Arms, who appeared
in very great Splendour, being most of them
very richly clad, many having been at great
Expence for their Equipage.</P>
<P>These Trained Bands consist of six Com∣panies,
of about two and three Hundred
Men in each Company; they make in all
about Fifteen Hundred Men: These stand∣ing
in their Order, reached all along the
West-end, the great Market, the High Street,
and so to the Court-yard.</P>
<P>All along this way, quite up to the Court,
before the Houses and Stalls, were built
Scaffolds, which were filled by a vast multi∣tude
of Spectators, who scrupled not to give
an 100 Guilders in some places for the use
of a Chamber during the Shew. The num∣ber
of Spectators being the greatest that has
ever been seen in the <HI>Hague;</HI> insomuch, that
one would have judged all the Inhabitants
of <HI>Holland</HI> to have been in this Town.</P>
<P>After the Pensionary had ended his Speech,
and His Majesty kindly Thanked them, the
Cavalcade proceeded. First went two very
<PB N="8" REF="88"/>
rich Coaches with six Horses, in which were
divers Persons of Quality, next the Kings
Life Guard, the Officers in extraordinary
rich Equipage: After them a great number
of Lacquees and Footmen all in the Kings
Livery, and black Velvet Caps; after them
came the Kings Pages, Gentlemen, and Ser∣vants
on Horseback, in extraordinary rich
Liveries. Then came His Majesty riding in
a large, and very richly Gilt Coach, drawn
by Six White Stone Horses, accompanied by
the Lord <HI>Overkirk</HI> on the left Hand, and the
Earls of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Scarborough</HI> over-against
him. On each side of the Coach the
Switzers with their Halbards, in rich Livery
Coats also, walked on Foot. The Provost
General <HI>Urck,</HI> and the Heer <HI>Roulas</HI> Captain
of the Switzers rid on Horseback immediate∣ly
before the Kings Coach, and after it came
about Twelve Coaches with Six Horses,
wherein Rid the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the Earls
of <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Portland,</HI> the Bishop of
<HI>London,</HI> and several other English Noblemen;
as also the chief Ministers of the Govern∣ment,
and the Magistrates of the <HI>Hague,</HI>
besides these, were many Coaches with
Four Horses.</P>
<P>The King as he passed along, was Salu∣ted,
and Complimented by divers Persons
of Quality, which His Majesty returned
with great Kindness, often looking out of
the Coach, with great Satisfaction upon the
<PB N="9" REF="88"/>
People, who shouted with extraordinary
Chearfulness, crying out, <HI>Long Live the King
our Stadtholder, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Stadthouse, by which the King was
to Ride, was Beautified with Seven very
Noble Transparent Pictures; behind which
they put Lights in the Evening, which were
set off with Garlands of made Flowers:
Above in the middle, was the King and
Queen, and on each side of them another
Picture; One of a Lion with this Motto,
<Q><L>Placidum venerantur, &amp; horrent infestum:</L>
<L>They Worship him when he is Calm, and Dread
him when he is Angry;</L></Q>
the other of an Unicorn, with this Motto,
<Q><L>Nihil passa Veneni: She can endure no Poison.</L>
<L>Underneath there are three other Pictures,</L></Q>
one of a Crane sitting upon his Nest, clapping
his Wings upon break of a Day, and Sun
Rising, with this Motto,
<Q>Recreatur ab Ortu: He is refreshed by the
Rising.</Q>
the other of an Atlas bearing the World up∣on
his bending Shoulders, resting with his
Breast upon a small Hill, with this Motto,
<Q>In te Domus inclinata recumbit: The leaning
House rests on Thee.</Q>
The Third, a Crane standing on his Nest,
and chattering upon the Rising of the Sun,
with this Motto,
<Q>Vidit &amp; Exaltavit: He saw it and was
glad.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="89"/>
In the Court of Justice by the side of the
Stadthouse, a Pillar was Erected four Rows
high, garnished with Coats of Arms; upon
which towards Night they set great numbers
of Flambeaux.</P>
<P>The Lords of the <HI>Hague</HI> raised also a Rich
and a Glorious Triumphal Arch in Honour
of this great Monarch, in the Market Place:
This was done upon the Account of his ha∣ving
been Born there; which as they look
upon to be one of the greatest Glories of the
Place, and whereof hereafter they will have
the greatest Reason to Boast, so they were
desirous to shew what Sence they had of it,
upon so very Glorious an occasion.</P>
<P>This is much the highest Arch of them all;
without any Pillars, and on both sides are
many Pictures done in light Colour; and
just over the passage there are two others
done upon Silk, and Transparent, so as that
by Lights, which were set behind them in
the Evening, they appeared very Glo∣riously.</P>
<P>At the top of all was placed a Sphear, and
above that, <HI>Fame</HI> Sounding a Trumpet in a
flying posture, and leading a <HI>Pegasus;</HI> with
Trophies at each Corner.</P>
<P>Behind this Arch, towards the High-street,
the Arms of the Emperor <HI>Adolphus,</HI> (who
was Descended of the House of <HI>Nassau)</HI> were
set up; and over them the Sixteen Quarters
of His Majesties Arms: But those that ma∣naged
<PB REF="89"/>
<PB REF="90"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>Kings Entertainment Pag:10</P>

<PB N="11" REF="91"/>
this matter, not understanding it so
well as they ought to have done, they have
committed several Mistakes, which in the
Graving I have altered: It is to no purpose
to set down the particulars, which lie chiefly
in the stating of the several S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utcheons, ac∣cording
to the precedency of the Kingdoms
over which His Majesties Ancestors had the
Governments, which though they are not
generally taken notice of by ordinary Ob∣servers;
yet, since upon such Solemnities,
the curiousest and most inquisitive Men are
always present, it was much to be Wished,
that those Things had been more exactly
regulated.</P>
<P>There were several Inscriptions round the
Arch: On the Front above the Gate, and
under the Arms of the <HI>Hague,</HI> was this,
<Q>Hîc Incunabula Divum: Here was the Cradle
of the Gods.</Q></P>
<P><HI>[Incunabula</HI> are properly the Swadling-Cloths
in which new Born Infants are wrapt up.]</P>
<P>Above, beneath, and on both sides was Writ,
<Q><HI>Nobilium primo, Ducum Maximo, Posthumo
Gulielmo III. Coelitus dat. To the chiefest of
Noblemen, the greatest of Dukes,</HI> [or <HI>Generals,</HI>
the word being ambiguous, coming
after Noblemen] <HI>the Posthumous Wil∣liam
III. given from Heaven.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>And behind above the Pictures,</HI>
<Q>Victoriis, Trophoeis, Fortissimo Imperateri, Desti∣nato,
Cautissimo Gubernatori,</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="92"/>
<HI>and underneath at the bottom of the Arch,</HI>
<Q>Quatuor Regnorum Regi, Foederati Belgii
Gubernatori, Gulielmo III. Virtute &amp; Tri∣umphis
fulgenti, Grati Animi &amp; Letitiae
publicae Signum hoc erexit Haga Comitis.
<HI>i.e.</HI> The <HI>Hague</HI> Erected this as a Testimony of her
Gratitude, and of the publick Joy for the
Victories and Trophies of <HI>William III.</HI>
King of Four Kingdoms, Stadtholder of
the United Provinces, equally Glorious
for his Virtue and his Success.</Q></P>
<P>On each side of the Arch there are two
Wings, which make a Semi-Circle; within
each of which are Seven Pictures representing
the Battels and Victories of the former Princes
of <HI>Orange</HI> by Sea and Land; every Picture ha∣ving
an Inscription under it.</P>
<P>On the First, on the Right Hand, <HI>Patientia
laesa fit furor: Injured Patience turns to Rage:</HI>
Intimating, that they had endured the Inso∣lencies
of the Spaniards as long as was possi∣ble,
and that at last they were forced to Rise.</P>
<P><HI>On the Second,</HI> Res poscit Opem, &amp; Con∣spirat
Amice: The Matter needs help, and
Prospers by Friendly Conference.</P>
<P><HI>On the Third,</HI> Per Tela, per Undas: Through
Weapons and Waves.</P>
<P><HI>On the Fourth,</HI> Audentes Deus ipse juvat:
God himself helps the daring.</P>
<P><HI>On the Fifth,</HI> Tantas dedit Unio vires <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Such Strength has Union given.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="92"/>
<HI>On the Sixth,</HI> Aquilas &amp; Moenia cepit: He
took Standards and Cities.</P>
<P><HI>On the Seventh,</HI> Celsas superat virtute Ca∣rinas:
He Conquers tall Ships by his Valour.</P>
<P><HI>On the first Picture of the left Hand,</HI> Re∣petenda
quiescunt Arma virum: The Arms of
the brave are at rest, hereafter to be resumed
again.</P>
<P><HI>On the Second,</HI> Non uno Virtus contenta
Triumpho: Virtue not content with one Triumph.</P>
<P><HI>On the Third,</HI> Crescunt numero crescente
Trophoea: As the number encreases so do their
Trophies too.</P>
<P><HI>On the Fourth,</HI> Caesorum replebant Funera
Campos: The Funerals of the Slain filled all the
Fields.</P>
<P><HI>On the Fifth,</HI> Ultra Garamantas &amp; Indos:
Beyond the furthermost parts of the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>On the Sixth,</HI> Fortis Promissa Juventae:
The promisses of valiant Youth.</P>
<P><HI>On the Seventh,</HI> Deos in praelia confert:
He brings the Gods to Combat for him.</P>
<P>Between these Wings there are two Py∣ramids
fixt upon Pedestals, each having a
Picture in the Front: In that on the Right
side, there is a Circle made up of Hearts,
with this Inscription, <HI>Hanc accipe Magne
Coronam: Great Hero accept this Crown.</HI></P>
<P>In that on the Left side, there is an Altar
with Incense, and this Inscription, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re tuo
redolent Arae: The Altars yeild a fragrant Smell
with thy Frankincense.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="93"/>
These Pyramids have each of them before
them three Transparent Pictures, containing
Hieroglyphicks and Trophies of Victory;
The Pyramids being covered on the sides
with Green: On one of these Pyramids was
set the Kings Picture; on the other the
Queens, at full length: On that of the
Kings was this Inscription, <HI>Quis gratior ap∣palit
Oris: What more acceptable Person ever
touched our Coasts.</HI> Upon the Queens, <HI>Re∣primit
&amp; Refigit: She Represses and Re-esta∣blishes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Over the Wings, the Figures of the Four
late Princes of</HI> Orange <HI>are set up; and un∣der
each some marks of Victory. Under</HI>
William <HI>the First,</HI> Patriae Liberatori: To the
Deliverer of his Country. <HI>Under Prince</HI> Mau∣rice,
Gloriae Vindici: The Vindicator of our Glory:
<HI>Under</HI> Frederick-Henry, Libertatis Assertori:
The Assertor of our Liberty. <HI>And under Prince</HI>
William <HI>the Second,</HI> Publicae Felicitatis Statori:
To the Establisher of the publick Happiness.</P>

<HEAD>The Triumphal Arch in the Court.</HEAD>
<P>PAssing from hence to the High-street they

<HEAD>A Description of the Fire∣works,
with their Repre∣sentations.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Canal behind the Court, upon a
large Scaffold, there were very fine
Fireworks prepared, which were Lighted
the Evening after His Majesty entred the
<HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle was the Kings Cypher,
with a Crown over it: On the sides stood
two high Pyramids, a Lyon, a <HI>Hercules,</HI>
and a Sun: On each Corner of the Scaffold
there were four Cases of Rockets, four of
which were much larger then the rest, which
represented the four Kingdoms of <HI>England,
Scotland, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with the Arms
of those Kingdoms: Round about there was
<PB N="23" REF="98"/>
Pallissado stuck with Rockets, some Orange
colour, some white, some blew, placed al∣ternately
to the number of Three Hundered
and Fifty.</P>
<P>They placed Fifteen Bulwarks round the
Scaffold, on which they had mounted
Cannon and Mortar pieces: Between which
they had large Mortars made like Beehives
and Pumps, which were charged with seve∣ral
sorts of Fireworks.</P>
<P>About half an hour after Six in the Even∣ning,
the Fireworks were Lighted: Just be∣fore
Thirty pieces of Cannon that were
planted upon the Wall of the Viver were
discharged; then follow'd Twenty five
Mortar shot on both sides of the Scaffold,
and afterwards the Crown and Cypher,
<HI>WR.</HI> which appeared like 350 Pearls shining
in the Air.</P>
<P>About the Pallissadoes they had planted
several Devices: Towards the States Cham∣ber
was one with these Words, <HI>Triumphat
semper Augustus: He Triumphs always August.</HI>
On each side of this there was one planted;
One was, <HI>Offensum metuunt Hostes: His Ene∣mies
Dread him when he is Offended.</HI> The
other, <HI>Carum venerantur Amici: His Friends
Worship Him who is so dear to them.</HI> These
shining very bright in the Air, made a very
pleasant show.</P>
<P>Over the Cipher and Crown was a Ship
toss'd about as in a Storm, with this Motto,
<PB N="24" REF="99"/>
<HI>Ne metuas, Caesarem vebis: Fear not, thou car∣riest</HI>
Caesar. This also was visible in the
Air.</P>
<P>When the Pyramids were Fired, they
gave a lowd buzzing Noise, which was now
and then Answered by the Mortars.</P>
<P><HI>Then the Belgick Lyon, and the</HI> Hercules,
<HI>play'd very wonderfully.</HI> Hercules'<HI>s Arms
were Expanded, firing with Eight several
Pauses, to denote his Labours, which were.</HI>
1. The Establishment of Religion and Liberty.
2. The securing the Tranquillity of <HI>Europe.</HI>
3. The Settlement of the Government upon a right
Bottom. 4. The Preservation of the Common
Interests of the People. 5. The Preservation of
Unity amongst the Neighbouring Princes. 6. The
clearing of the Sea, and the increasing of Trade.
7. The Advancement of the Glory of this State.
8. The concluding of a firm and lasting Peace.</P>
<P>While the Fire play'd so finely, the Air
was full of the crackling Noise, and the
Buzzes of the several sorts of Fireworks, and
they continued so very thick, that it did in
a good measure dispel the Fog, which was
then very thick. At times they lighted
Water-Balls, Water-Candles, Water-Bullets,
Water-Boats, Water-Morters, Rats and Dol∣phins
in a Vessel upon the Canal, which
sputtering and crackling upon the Water,
gave an Entertainment so great, that several
Ingenious Men, who understood these Mat∣ters,
owned, that they had never seen any
Thing like it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="99"/>
They kindled also some Hundreds of pitch
Barrels set round the Scaffold, which en∣creased
the light, whereby the other Works
which play'd all the while, were discerned
the better. It lasted till about Eight, and
was ended with Twenty five Mortar-shot;
after which the Cannon were several times
discharged: The whole was done without
any Mischance, save only the loss of one
Gunner, who sweeping a Cannon, lost both
his Hands, and died of his Wounds. When
His Majesty came to Court, the Militia. stood
in order in the outer Court, before the Tri∣umphal
Arch, <HI>viz.</HI> Baron <HI>Friesem</HI>'s Regi∣ment
of Foot, Baron <HI>Heyde</HI>'s Regiment of
Horse, who having discharged all together,
went to the <HI>Viverbergh</HI> to give way to the
Train Bands in Arms. Several of the Lords
of the States were in the Council Chamber,
to Countenance this publick Joy.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Berka,</HI> and the Heer <HI>Co∣lomma,</HI>
the Imperial and Spanish Ministers
testified their Satisfaction by Illuminations
before their Lodgings: Mijn Heer <HI>Schuylen∣bergh</HI>
did the same at his own House upon
the <HI>Viverbergh</HI> with Noble Illuminations,
beautified with several Devices: As, <HI>Regi
Gulielmo Reduci: To King</HI> William <HI>returned
again. Transitque feritque: He passes by and
strikes. Imperat Augustus:</HI> Augustus <HI>Governs.
Superat Coelestibus alis: He mounts with
Heavenly Wings. Generosus ab Ortu: Noble
<PB N="26" REF="100"/>
from his Birth.</HI> These were to be seen some
time after. Others also gave other instan∣ces
of their Satisfaction, every Man after
his own Fancy.</P>
<P>This was also graced with so vast a resort
of People, as had never before been seen at
the <HI>Hague:</HI> Some coming to see the Solem∣nity,
others to see the King once more re∣turned
again, and Crowned with so much
Honour.</P>
<P>The King well satisfied with all these their
Demonstrations of Esteem and Reverence,
immediately applied himself to Business;
having first given Audiences of Congratula∣tion
to all the Colleges and Deputies of the
Cities, and to some great Lords and publick
Ministers.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and two
Princes of the House of <HI>Anspach,</HI> (who came
two days before the publick Entry) were often
with the King, and sometimes the Ministers
of the other Allies joyned with them: It was
said, That three Ruffians were sent from the
French Court to cut off the King, and that
there were particular Informations given in
of their Persons.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> the 7th in the Afternoon the King
went into the Assembly of the States General,
and took his place as Stadtholder and Cap∣tain
General; and made an Oration to them,
to this purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="100"/>
That when His Majesty was last in Council,
he acquainted their High and Mightynesses with
His Intention to go over into <HI>England</HI> with the
Assistance which they were pleased to give Him,
to deliver that Nation from their Impending
Dangers, and which in part had befallen them:
And that God Almighty had so far Blessed Him,
as that He had brought His Affairs to a Happier
Issue then at first He could possibly Wish for; for
which Reason they offered Him the Crowns of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which He accepted
of, not out of any Ambition, (for He was not
to be Corrupted with that, or Money) but only
to preserve Religion and Liberty in those King∣doms;
and to be able to give the Allies a vigorous
Assistance against the Power of <HI>France,</HI> which
he had given before in a more particular manner,
if the Affairs of <HI>Ireland</HI> had not diverted Him;
which being now better settled than they were be∣fore,
He was now come over, not only to take
such Measures with their High and Mighty
Lordships, as should be most for the advantage of
the Confederates, but also to perform the Duty of
Captain General; And that from His tenderest
Years He had always a High Regard for that
State, and should always be ready to give greater
Proofs, if it were possible, how ready He
should be to promote their Welfare, for which he
would joyfully hazard His Life, if it might be a
means to preserve the Liberty of <HI>Europe,</HI> and
to encrease the Felicity of the <HI>United Provinces:
And finally,</HI> He Recommended Himself to the
<PB N="28" REF="101"/>
good Wishes of their High and Mighty Lord∣ships.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Lord President Thanked
His Majesty in their Lordships Name, for
the Honour which was done unto them by
his appearing once more in Person amongst
them: And he assured him, that they were
highly sensible of those Obligations which he
had Conferred upon them from time to time,
by engaging in so great dangers so readily
for their Sakes: And further, that they should
always Thankfully Acknowledge how much
He had done for them; wishing Him all
Happiness in all His Undertakings, promi∣sing
their Concurrence with His Majesty to
the utmost, and that they should contribute
whatever they were able, to advance the
common Interest, and His Majesties Satis∣faction.</P>
<P>He afterwards made a Speech to the State
of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was answered much to the
same purpose.</P>
<P>The Evening before the King visited the
Princess of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> Lady to the Hereditary
Stadtholder of <HI>Friezeland;</HI> as also the Prin∣cess
<HI>Radzevile,</HI> and the Princess of <HI>Saxe-Eysenach.</HI>
The next day the King Treated
the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> and several other Lords at the
House in the Wood, and returned in the
Evening again to the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="101"/>
The Ninth in the Morning the Heer
<HI>Prielmeyer,</HI> the Envoy of the Elector of <HI>Ba∣varia,</HI>
had Audience of His Majesty; he
was Conducted from his Lodgings about
Ten a Clock, by the Master of the Cere∣monies,
with some Coaches and Six Horses,
and was received at the Stair-foot by the
Swiss Guards placed in Order, and received
by their Officer at the end of the Guard
Room, and thence conducted through the
Anti-Chamber into the Presence; where af∣ter
he had paid the accoustomed Reverences;
he made a Harangue in French to this
purpose.</P>
<P>That he was sent by the Elector his Master to
Congratulate His Majesties happy Successes, and
that his Master had begun his Journey as soon as
ever he had heard that His Majesty had begun
His; so that he expected him every Hour; to be
ready upon the spot to assure His Majesty of his
Readiness to serve the common Cause, and parti∣cularly
to second those Glorious Undertakings▪
which His Majesty had so happily begun: And
for his part, he only farther begg'd, That his
Person might not be unacceptable.</P>
<P><HI>To this the King replied,</HI> That he Thank'd
his Electoral Highness. That he should always en∣deavour
to promote the common Interest; and
therefore would joyn with the Elector, and that
He was Oblig'd to his Highness for this Trouble;
<HI>and lastly,</HI> that his Person was very acceptable.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="102"/>
Then the Envoy presented his Gentlemen
to the King, who kissed his Hand; and af∣terwards
the Envoy was carried back in the
same manner to his Lodgings as he was
brought up.</P>
<P>Then the Envoys of <HI>Mentz, Cologne,
Munster</HI> and <HI>Hambourg,</HI> had their publick
Audiences, after whom came the Elector of
<HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who had a private Audience
of near two Hours.</P>

Earls, Barons, and Gentlemen with∣out
Number. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and
the Marquis <HI>de Gastanaga</HI> kept publick Tables.</P>
<P>The 24th, about Ten in the Morning, the
Count <HI>de Winditsgratz</HI> had publick Audience
of the King, Conducted by the Master of
the Ceremonies, with all the usual Solemni∣ties:
He Congratulated His Majesties happy
Successes, and assured him that the Emperor
his Master esteemed himself very much ob∣liged
to His Majesty, for that Care and Con∣cern
which he show'd for the common
Cause; and he further added, that his Ma∣ster
look'd upon His Britannick Majesty, as
the principal moving Cause upon whom
every thing else depended, that might be for
the advantage of the Confederacy.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Envoy had Audi∣ence
of the King the same day.</P>
<P>The 25th in the Morning the King, with
the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and the Landt∣grave
of <HI>Hesse,</HI> went to the great Church,
where they heard a Sermon Preached by
Mr. <HI>Ulier;</HI> who towards the latter end, said
several moving Things to His Majesty. In
the Afternoon, the King with the Electors
of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and the Landt∣grave
<PB N="35" REF="104"/>
of <HI>Hesse,</HI> all four in a Coach, took
three or four turns round the <HI>Voorhout,</HI> with
the Glasses down upon the Kings side, who
was received by the thronging Multitudes
with all imaginable Demonstrations of Affe∣ction
and Joy.</P>
<P>The 26th, the Count <HI>de Prela Doria,</HI> En∣voy
Extraordinary from the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI>
Count <HI>d' Autel,</HI> with the same Character from
the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> had Audience of His
Majesty, as had on the 27th the Sieur <HI>Hax∣huysen</HI>
from the Elector of <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 5th, the Earl of <HI>Devonshire</HI>
Treated the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> the
Landtgrave of <HI>Hesse,</HI> the Prince <HI>Commercy,</HI>
and divers other Persons of Quality with great
Magnificence, where His Majesty was pleased
to Honour his Lordship with His Presence.</P>
<P>On the 11th the Duke of <HI>Zell</HI> arrived at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Wolfembuttel</HI> on
the 14th.</P>
<P>During all this time the Congresses had
been held almost every day, with great Se∣crecy,
His Majesty always Honouring them
with His Presence, when at last, the matters
being fully Concerted, and all Things agreed
upon to the mutual Satisfaction of all the
Princes, this great Council broke up, and the
Princes returned to their respective Homes,
to put in execution the Designs here agreed
upon, the good Effects whereof we doubt
not but to see this Campagne, notwithstand∣ing
<PB N="36" REF="105"/>
the unhappy accident of the loss of
<HI>Mons.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty having given Orders to all
the Troops to be in a readiness to take the
Field by the first of <HI>April,</HI> was pleased on the
16th to depart for <HI>Loo,</HI> being accompanied
with the Duke of <HI>Zell,</HI> who Rid in the same
Coach with Him, and lay that Night at the
House of Monsieur <HI>Zullestein;</HI> where he was
met by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who likewise
accompanied His Majesty to <HI>Loo,</HI> where they
arrived the next Evening, having been Com∣plemented
as they passed along with all De∣monstrations
of Respect and Affection, by
the City of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and the several Towns
he pass'd through, and accompanied every
where with the loud Acclamations of the
People, who were almost overwhelm'd with
Joy, at the extraordinary Honour they re∣ceived
by the Presence of this most illustrious
Monarch.</P>
<P>But His Majesty had not been long there
before he received the unwelcome Tidings
of the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> an Express arriving at
the <HI>Hague</HI> on the 16th in the Evening, that
the French Troops had suddenly invested the
Town of <HI>Mons,</HI> their Horse having taken
Possession of all the Avenues on the 15th of
<HI>March,</HI> and that the Foot were marching up
with all Diligence.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Stee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>huysen,</HI> and the Mar∣quis
<HI>Bedmar,</HI> being sent from the Governor
<PB N="37" REF="105"/>
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> arrived at the <HI>Hague</HI> the 17th,
and after a short Conference with Prince
<HI>Waldeck,</HI> went Post to <HI>Loo,</HI> to give His Ma∣jesty
an account of the State of the Affair.
Who being resolved Himself to Head the
Army, in order to raise the Siege, returned
to the <HI>Hague;</HI> from whence having dispatched
Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> with necessary Orders for
<HI>Flanders,</HI> set forward Himself the 26th for
<HI>Brussels;</HI> the Army in the mean time pre∣paring
with all imaginable diligence to Muster
at <HI>Hall,</HI> whither His Majesty went on the
6th of <HI>April,</HI> intending to have marched the
next day at the Head of the Army, which
consisted of 30000 Foot and 16000 Horse,
with a Train of Artillery of 71 pieces of
Cannon and 14 Mortars. But the Carriages
not being all come up, was obliged to defer
His March for two or three days.</P>
<P>The French had all this time very vi∣gourously
attacked the Outworks of the
Town, but were as vigourously repulsed by
the Besieged, to the great loss of the Enemy,
who paid dearly for what he gained; inso∣much,
that it was not doubted, but the Town
would have been able to have held out till the
Army came up to its Relief, but the French
King (who was himself all the while at St.
<HI>Gislain,</HI> near the Camp, the Dauphin Com∣manding
in Chief) according to his old Me∣thods,
had found means of gaining a Party
among the Burghers and Clergy in the
<PB N="38" REF="106"/>
Town, who prevailing upon the rest, by the
terrifying Destruction the Bombs and Cannon
made in their Houses, and persuading them
that by a timely Surrender of the Town they
might obtain Honourable Conditions, made
them basely desert the publick Good, and
altogether unexpectedly, even to the French
themselves, on the 8th of <HI>April,</HI> beat a Parley,
and sent out three Officers, as Hostages for
three French Offices, who immediately en∣tred
the Town, to Treat upon Articles of
Surrender; the Governor the Prince <HI>de Bergue</HI>
oppos'd the Surrender, and refus'd to deliver
the Gate to the French as the Burghers had
agreed, endeavouring to disswade them from
this their Resolution, alledging he could still
hold out till the Relief came; but all would
not do, the Burghers wre resolved, and they
being stronger than the Garison, who were
all employed in the Outworks, the Honourable
Governor was forced to submit, and about
Midnight the Capitulation was Signed on
both sides; and the next day <HI>April</HI> the 9th,
a Gate of the Town was deliver'd up to the
French Guards; and on the 10th, the Ga∣rison
marched out, being about 4000, Foot
and 400 Horse, with Arms, Baggage, Drums
beating, Colours flying, six pieces of Cannon,
two Mortars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were conducted to <HI>Tu∣biese▪</HI>
a few Miles from <HI>Mons</HI> towards <HI>Brussels.</HI></P>
<P>The King having received this surprizing
News just as he was ready to march to their
<PB N="39" REF="106"/>
Relief, was forced to alter his Measures; and
understanding that the French King had se∣perated
his Troops, and dispos'd 'em into
Garisons; and that he with the Dauphin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
were return'd to <HI>Versailles,</HI> broke up the Camp,
and having sent Reinforcements to <HI>Charleroy,
Aeth, Namur,</HI> and the other Frontier Gari∣sons,
went to <HI>Brussels;</HI> and from thence to
the <HI>Hague,</HI> where he was pleased to Honour
the Duke of <HI>Zell</HI> (who was likewise return'd
thither from the Camp) with the Noble Or∣der
of the Garter, who was invested with
the Garter and George by the King Himself,
assisted by the Dukes of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Ormond,</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>Devonshire:</HI> This was perform'd
privately in the Kings Bed-Chamber the 18th
of <HI>April:</HI> And the next day, <HI>Garter</HI> King at
Arms presented to his Highness the rest of
the Ensigns, with the whole Habit and Or∣naments
of the Order, which his Highness
having Received, was pleased to make a ve∣ry
Noble Present to the King at Arms, and
to all the Retinue he had brought with him
upon this Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 22d, His Majesty having taken
leave of the States General, and been Com∣plimented
by them, with all the Expres∣sions
of sincere Affection, took Shiping
in the <HI>Maese</HI> in order to his Return for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and the Wind being fair, the next Morn∣ing
made the English Shore; and that Even∣ing,
<HI>viz. April</HI> the 13th, 1691. <HI>O. S.</HI> about
<PB N="40" REF="107"/>
Eight of the Clock landed at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> having
been Saluted by the Fleet, as he passed along
with all their Guns, and the repeated Huzza's
of the Seamen, who Demonstrated the most
extraordinary Joy imaginable; and by the
Guns of the Forts of <HI>Tilbury, Gravesend,</HI> and
the Tower; also by the Ships that lay in the
River; and the Joyful Acclamations of the
People, who crowded in great Numbers
upon the Shore, and in Boats, to see His
Majesty, and express their Joy upon his happy
Return, continually Repeating,
<Q>God Save King William and Queen Mary,
and Prosper their Arms by Sea and Land.</Q></P>
<P>Thus have we finished our short Journal
of His Majesties Voyage into <HI>Holland,</HI> where∣in
we have been as particular as was conve∣nient,
and as brief as possible; we have all
along carefully avoided all manner of Re∣flections
and Animadversions of our own,
and given only a true Relation of the matter
of Fact as it occur'd; wherein if we have
the good Fortune to please the Reader, we
have our End.</P>
