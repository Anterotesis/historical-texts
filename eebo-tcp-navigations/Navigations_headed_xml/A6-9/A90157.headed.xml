<HEAD>Oneals Escape out of the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THese times, I beleeve are not unacquainted with the sinister disposition of <HI>Oneal,</HI> who for his wicked intentions in the last expedi∣tion in the North was committed by the House of Parliament to the Gate-House, and afterwards hee was by the same power committed to the Tower, where he hath remained ever since. And upon the 4 of this present May, as one guilty of the Allegations against him, hee made his escape both from his pri∣son, and the present Iustice of the Law. The manner of his escape is after a very diverse manner supposed, and judged; some suspecting his Escape to be made in the disguise of a Porters Frock, wherby hee did delude his Keepers apprehension; othets suspecting his escape to be made over the walls, either by the help of a Roap, or else by some other instrument, which the Assistance of his present Fears or friends, did provide for him.</P>
<P>This Prisoner being for some space not seen as before in publique, a great Iealousie immediately possessed the Keepers breast; whereupon fearing that he might be suddenly taken with some extream
<PB REF="3"/> melady, which might occasion his stay in his cham∣ber, the Lieutenant and other Officers immediatly went to his Chamber, suspecting, and fearing him to be dead; but upon their search, they found neither their prisoner, nor almost any thing in his Chamber, for between him and his boy, they had conveyed a∣way from his bed one pair of sheets, one Table-Cloath, and one long Towell, which did confirm their former feats of his Escape. And now finding to be true, what they before but suspected, the Lieu∣tenant for his own security, gave present informati∣on of his escape unto the Parliament, who no soo∣ner received the News of his Escape, but wisely considering the dangers that might ensue the liber∣ty of such an ill and disaffected Member, gave pre∣sent Order for his apprehension, and gave Power and Commission unto the said Lieutenant of the Tower, to issue forth Warrants for his speedy Ap∣prehensions.</P>
<P>The Allegations against him, which occasioned his imprisonment, I have briefly and faithfully set down.</P>
