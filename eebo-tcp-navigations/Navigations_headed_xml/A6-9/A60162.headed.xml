<P>The Shore on the <HI>East</HI> from the <HI>Bay</HI> to the Ocean, is but about twenty miles broad.</P>
<P>The Rivers on the <HI>West</HI> of the <HI>Bay</HI> are Navigable, some 40. some 50. some 100. some 200. some 300. miles; which Bay, Rivers and Creeks are plentiful of Fowle from <HI>September</HI> till <HI>March,</HI> of all sorts, as Swans, Geese, Brants, Ducks, Widgeon, Teale, with many other sorts too tedious to relate, some of which tarry with them all <HI>Summer:</HI> And Fish multitudes, as Porposses, Grampases, Herring-Hoggs, Drums, Sheepsheads, Bass, Mullets, Pearch, Sturgeon, Eales, Salmon, Trouts, Thornbacks, Garrs, Cats, Oysters, Crabs, Turtles, with many more too tedious to relate.</P>

Nutts, with Grape-Vines climbing up the trees very fruitfull; and Hops also in the Woods; multitudes of Rasberies, Strawberies, Barberies, Cranberies, with infi∣nite of all sorts of Hearbs; the best Garden in <HI>England</HI> affords not better.</P>
<P>In Orchards all sorts of Apple-Trees, Pear-Trees, Quince, Peach, Apricocks, Cherries, Figg-Trees, and Vines; Gardens as good as <HI>England</HI> affords for flowers, hearbs and roots of all sorts; with Colworts, Musmillions, Cue∣cumbers, Wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>millions, May-cocks, Hornes, Peshaues, Ros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>Trees, sweet-Bryers, and many things more.</P>

<P>There is a Root common in the Woods called <HI>Tuckaho,</HI> the Natives eat it for bread; our Swine eat it; with Acorns and Nuts of all sorts, they are Fat; and is the sweetest Bacon that ever man tasted.</P>
<P>The planters feed not their Swine nor Cattle, but kill them fat out of the Woods.</P>
<P>There is Fullers-Earth, Marle, Salt-peter, Iron, Stone, Lead, Tin and Silver Oar.</P>
<P>There is plenty of English graine, as Wheat, Barley, Beanes, Peas and Oats.</P>
<P>The ground is very fruitful, and produceth plentiful Crops with great speed, what ever is planted or Sown; as for example, one careful laborious man will plant, tend, and get in 50. barrels of Indian Wheat, without the help of Man, Horse or Oxe; each barrel is five English bushels. And if the stone or see of any fruit be sown, it will bear the third year without graft∣ing; each Planter makes great Crops of To∣bacco; the <HI>Western</HI> limits of the Land are un∣known In <HI>Mary-Land;</HI> their Religion is free to all that profess to believe in Jesus Christ.</P>
