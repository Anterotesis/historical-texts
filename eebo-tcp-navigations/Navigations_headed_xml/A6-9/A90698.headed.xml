<HEAD>To His Grace Charles Seamour, Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving been some years Secretary to the King's Minister at the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and brought some Memoirs from thence relating both to the Ancient and Mo∣dern
<PB REF="3"/>State of that King∣dom, I was prevailed with, through the Importunities of some Friends, to com∣mit them to the Press. For the <HI>Northern</HI> Regions not lying in the usual Road of our Travellers, and not being thought to have any thing sufficiently inviting as to engage them to undergo the inconvenien∣cies and hardships that at∣tend all Voyages into those Parts, nor to make such a stay as is requisite for the
<PB REF="3"/>rendring their Observations worthy of the Curiosity of the Age. We are gene∣rally very much in the Dark as to the Government and Manners of those People. This has made me liable, since my return from those Climats, to daily Que∣stions about them, especial∣ly of late, since the Discour∣ses of the Match between my Lady <HI>Ann,</HI> and Prince <HI>George;</HI> People beginning to accuse themselves for entertaining so slender an
<PB REF="4"/>Opinion of these Countries, that can produce a Prince every way so great, and endued with such Royal Qualities, as is His Royal Highness.</P>
<P>Though these Considera∣tions made me give way to the instancy of my Ac∣quaintance, yet I could not resolve upon the making them publick, without im∣ploring the Patronage of your Graces Illustrious Name. And though I ought to have curb'd my
<PB REF="4"/>Presumption from offering you up so unpolisht, and so imperfect an Oblation, yet hoping that some things in it might merit your Graces Speculation, I flatter'd my self that your Grace a∣bounding with so much goodness, would pardon in me the Ambition I had to declare the profound Zeal, Respect and Submission wherewith I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Graces Most humble and most obedient Servant, G. PIERREVILLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Present State</HI> OF <HI>DENMARK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> con∣taining that part of the <HI>Cimbrick, Chersonese,</HI> called <HI>Juitland, Hol∣stein,</HI> a great Shoal of Islands, the Prin∣cipal whereof are <HI>Zealand, Funen,</HI> and many more, but of less Note, with the great continent of <HI>Norway,</HI> and the Isles thereof, is Bounded on the <HI>West</HI> with the Main <HI>Western</HI> Ocean, on the <HI>East</HI> with the <HI>Bal∣tick</HI> Sea, on the <HI>North-East</HI> with part of <HI>Sweedland, Full-North</HI> with the Main Frozen Ocean, and on the <HI>South</HI> with <HI>Germany,</HI> from which it is seperated on the <HI>South-west</HI> by the River <HI>Albis,</HI> and on the <HI>South-East</HI> by the <HI>Trave,</HI> a small <HI>Isthmus</HI> or Neck of Land Uniting it to that Con∣tinent.</P>
<P>It had its Name from the People of those many Islands which lie together in the <HI>Bay</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>or <HI>Gulph,</HI> called <HI>Sinus Codanus,</HI> (Now the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea,) who took upon them the Name of <HI>Danes,</HI> Extending their Name afterwards as they did their Conquest, and not from <HI>Dan</HI> a Fabulous King thereof, above a Thousand years before the Birth of our Saviour.</P>
<P>As for its Position in regard of the Hea∣vens, part of it lieth within the <HI>Northern</HI> temperate <HI>Zone,</HI> and part within the <HI>Artict</HI> Circle; reaching from the middle Parallel of the 10th Clime, or 55 Degree of Latitude, where it Joyneth with <HI>Ger∣many</HI> as far as the 71 Degree, where the Frozen Ocean is its only Boundary, thus the longest Day in the <HI>Southern</HI> parts hereof, is 17 hours and a quarter: But in the parts farthest <HI>North,</HI> they have no Night for two whole Months, three Weeks, one day, and some Seaven hours over; as on the Contrary, no Day for the like space of time, when the Sun is farthest distant in the other <HI>Tropick.</HI> Thus the Air would be very sharp and bitter, were it not Tem∣perated by the warm Vapours of the Sun, by which means in <HI>Juitland, Zealand,</HI> and the Adjoyning Islands, it is not so Cold as in places which lie much more <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho the Land be Naturally Sterile, and affording little besides Woods and
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>Mountains, yet the Care and Industry of the Inhabitants have made it very Fruit∣ful.</P>
<P><HI>Denmark</HI> abounds in Rich Pastures, which Feed such vast Numbers of Cattle, that it has been some times known, that in one Year a Hundred-Thousand Cows and Oxen, have been hence Exported in∣to <HI>Germany</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> which brings a Vast Income to the Kingdom, nor do they want excellent Breeds of Horses, that part of it called <HI>Oldenburg</HI> especially, Furnishing the best and finest Coach-Horses of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea Coasts of <HI>Juitland, Zealand,</HI> and other parts of the <HI>Danish</HI> Territories, are plied with such Vast Shoals of <HI>Herrings, Plaise, Whitings, Cod,</HI> and other Fish, that they are almost capable of Hindring the Passage of Boats and Ships.</P>
<P>Nor are their Forrests less stocked with Venison, there being no less every Hun∣ting Season than Fifteen Hundred <HI>Bucks</HI> brought into the Kings Pallaces, besides Vast numbers of Wilde <HI>Boars, Hares,</HI> and such like sort of Gaim.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, the mean Opinion which the <HI>Romans</HI> had, and the Ill Charact∣er they have given us of all the <HI>Northern</HI> Nations, yet they found themselves con∣strained
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>to Buckle under their Vigourous Attacks, and abandon their City and Country as a Prey to the Pillage and Mercy of the Triumphing <HI>Cambrians,</HI> nor are the other <HI>Northern</HI> Nations, insensible of the Mettle and keenness of the <HI>Dan∣ish</HI> Swords; the <HI>Danes</HI> having Conquered <HI>Ireland</HI> no less than Eight several times, Beaten, the <HI>English</HI> Ten times and who for a long while were Subject to the Kings of <HI>Den∣mark; Scotland</HI> for some time Tributary to this Crown; <HI>Saxony</HI> has paid Homage to several of the <HI>Danish</HI> Kings, and <HI>Sweeden</HI> frequently own'd e'm for their Soveraigns, nor is the Kingdom of <HI>Norway</HI> a small proof of the <HI>Danish</HI> Courage, neither have their Women been Barren of Brave per∣formances, their Exploits being equally Glorious with those of the greatest Heroes of other Nations. But Valour and War∣like Conduct are not the only qualities praise worthy in the <HI>Danes,</HI> they are no less to be Commended for their. Hospita∣lity and Extraordinary Complaisance to all Strangers; and tho their Entertainments do sometimes degenerate into Luxury and excess, yet without doubt the Crime is much more Pardonable in them than those who live under a more happy Climate. The <HI>Danes</HI> indeed are Haughty and Super∣stitiously
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>Jealous of their Honor, revenging the least outrage and contempt, and resent∣ing to a High Degree all things which give the least apprehension of an Affront, and as they are Rigorous Prosecutors of Insults done to themselves, so are they no less severe Punishers of Criminals of State, especially Thieves and Pirates. And as they are Peremptory in their Executing of Justice upon Offenders, so are they most Religious in doing and Distributing it where due, and Inviolable observers of their Words and Contracts.</P>
<P>The Bulck and Stature of the Bodies of the <HI>Danes,</HI> does in somewise suit with the Grandure of their minds, and tho the Luxu∣ry of the Age has so far prevailed in <HI>Den∣mark</HI> as to quash the growth of their Mo∣dern <HI>Danes</HI> in respect of their Ancestors, yet they be still more Large, Strong, Vi∣gorous, and long Liv'd than most or any of their Neighbours. They are generally fair Complexion'd, their Hair something in∣clined to Yellow.</P>
<P>Their common Food is on Corn, Fish, and all manner of Tame and Wild Beasts that are Mans Meat, which they have in great abundance. And amongst their many kind of Fowl, they have greater store of Wood-Cocks than any other Coun∣trey
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>whatsoever. The Old Liquor of <HI>Den∣mark</HI> was <HI>Oel,</HI> (<HI>Ale,</HI> or <HI>Beer,</HI>) made of Malt and Water, and is still their com∣mon and most general Drink. And tho Wine has now obtain'd much among them, yet perhaps their excess therein has Cur∣tailed much of their pristine Vigour, and that had they kept constant and solely to their <HI>Oel,</HI> it might have spirited them to as great Actions as those of their Pre∣decessors.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Danish</HI> Language, it is only a distinct Dialogue of the <HI>Teutonick,</HI> the <HI>High-Dutch, Sweedish, Norwegion, Flan∣drian,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> being no more, and all Derived from one Mother Tongue.</P>
<P>As for the Government of <HI>Denmark,</HI> without dwelling upon the Fabulous stories of King <HI>Dan,</HI> it is Evidently to be made out, that it was a Monarchy in the Consultship of <HI>Catulus</HI> and <HI>Marius,</HI> near a hundred years before <HI>Christ,</HI> after which we have an account of one <HI>Gothrick</HI> King of the <HI>Danes</HI> in the time of the Emperour <HI>Charles Magne,</HI> from whom the present King of <HI>Denmark</HI> is Descended in a Lineal Succession, though some Authors do affirm that the Ancient Line failed in the Death of King <HI>Christopher</HI> the 3d.</P>
<P>The Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> it self was
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>Elective untill the year 1660. Neverthe∣less the <HI>Senatours</HI> generally chose the El∣dest Son of their Soveraign, who from that time forth was Stiled the Prince, and the other of the Kings Sons, the Dukes and Heirs of <HI>Norway.</HI> Now their Electi∣on in former times was performed after a very Solemn manner, for as many of the Nobles as were <HI>Senatours,</HI> and had Power of Voting and giving their suffrages, hav∣ing pitcht upon some Commodious place in the Fields, where having placed them∣selves in a Circle, upon so many great Stones they past their Votes, and having Seated their new Elected Soveraign in the middle, upon a Stone Higher than the Rest, they Saluted Him King. There being to this Day in <HI>Zealand</HI> such a company of Stones which bear the Name of <HI>King-Seat.</HI> But after the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> had been thus Elective for above Two Hundred years in the present <HI>Oldenburg</HI> Family, the chief Power of Election, as I said being, in the Nobility, those Nobles took this means and occasion to Capitulate advantages to themselves, as Previous and Preliminary Conditions to the Election, which every succeeding King was forced to comply with, to the Curtailing, Dispoiling, and Weakning of the Crown, and to the pre∣judice
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>and disadvantage of the other Or∣ders of the Kingdom, insomuch that none but a Noble Man could Buy, Purchase, or possess in his own Right any Seigniory or Mannour. A Cittizen or Burgher was not capable of purchasing more than a House, and perhaps a Guarden and an Or∣chard, or some such slender business. The Lands and Revenues of the Crown were let our to Noble Men, it may be not to the Third, often not to the Fourth part of what they were really worth, and yet the King could not raise the Old Rents, tho the Nobles in the mean while kept the under-tennents Chewing upon a rack Rent. The Pesants in the <HI>Danish</HI> Island were Villains Reguardant to the Mannors of Noble Men. All publick Offices and ad∣vancements were Monopolized by the Nobility. And meer merit without the Circumstances of Nobility of Extraction and Grandure of State, was excluded all Countenance, Protection and Preferment. Thus the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> which shown with so much Lustre, Renown and Glory in former Ages, was Dwindled almost in∣to an <HI>Aristocrasie,</HI> and hardly the shaddow of what it had been some Centuries before. But upon the Occasion of a Warr between <HI>Carolus Gustavus</HI> King of <HI>Sweeden,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="9"/><HI>Frederick</HI> the 3d. King of <HI>Denmark</HI> in the Year 1660. Great Priviledges were pro∣posed and conferred upon the Burgers of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> the better to Encourage them to stand the more Valiantly in Defence of their King and Countrey, least the Pros∣pect of mending their Circumstances un∣der a new Master, should prevail with them to abandon their Old. Now the Privi∣ledges Established in that juncture were an equal admission to Offices and Honours, according to the Deserts and Capacities of them and their Children, a Power of Pur∣chasing Lands and Lordships with the same Rights as the Nobles. <HI>Copenhagen</HI> to be one of the Estates of the Kingdom, and to have a Suffrage in all publick Councels and Resolves, and the Crown turn'd from Elective to Hereditary, and so freed from the Guardianship of the Nobility. Thus that juncture, how Menacing soever it seemed to the whole Realm of <HI>Denmark,</HI> yet proved of such advantage as to rein-state the King in all that Power that was necessary for the Defending of His Do∣minions against the Invasions and Insults of Forreigners, and the Oppressions and Usurpations of one fellow Subject upon an other. Thus the Complexion of that Government is much more Vigorous, and
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>there is a better Circulation of the Bles∣sings to be Enjoyed under a happy Sway, since this Reformation, than had been for some Ages before under several Reigns together.</P>
<P>The account of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> before the Planting of Christianity in that Country, will be found a difficult matter to be Stated, their Chronicles before that time being for the most part feign'd and fabulous, as well as that of other Nations. But according to the most careful, Judi∣cious and Modestest Relations of that matter, we shall set down the following Catalogue.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Harald</HI> being forced to Fly his Kingdom by the Accomplices of his Bro∣ther <HI>Reinferd,</HI> had recourse to the Empe∣rour <HI>Ludowick</HI> for Succour, who Furnished him with Forces for the Reinstating him in his Kingdom, but upon Condition he would abandon his Heathenisme, and be Converted to Christianity. Accordingly he was Baptized in the year 826, and was forthwith set again upon his Throne. But not long after he turn'd Idolater a∣gain, adn so remained till he was pre∣vailed with to Renounce it by St. <HI>Angchar.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Eric</HI> Succeeded his Brother <HI>Harald,</HI> and though he had been Baptized with
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>him at the Emperours Court, yet he per∣secuted the Christians with the same Cru∣elty as his Brother had done in the time of his Relapse. During his Reign, name∣ly, about the year 853. the <HI>Danes</HI> are said to have first Invaded <HI>France,</HI> under the Conduct of their General <HI>Rollo,</HI> though others would have <HI>Gotfrid</HI> to have made the first Eruption into that Kingdom, and that <HI>Rollo</HI> did not enter <HI>France</HI> till the year 876. and was not Established peace∣ably in <HI>Normandy,</HI> till 889. or 890.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Eric Barn,</HI> or the Child being the only Male left alive of the Royal Family after the Bloody Wars between <HI>Eric</HI> and <HI>Guthorn</HI> King of <HI>Norway.</HI> But he had not been long upon the Throne, before he Re∣newed the Persecution upon the Christians with more Cruelty then his Prodecessors had done, destroying more Churches, Bi∣shops, and Religious Houses, then all the other <HI>Danish</HI> Kings put together; He Pro∣secuted his Wars in <HI>Germany</HI> with great Gallantry and Conduct, Slaying with his own Hands <HI>Bruno</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and Twelve Counts. He Departed this Life in the year 902.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Canutus Lodneknut</HI> or the <HI>Hairy</HI> Suc∣ceeded his Father <HI>Eric.</HI> In his time every Third Man in <HI>Denmark</HI> went to seek his
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>Fortune, and those who went away thus upon these Expeditions over-run all <HI>Prusia, Courland, Semgal,</HI> and other Countries, where they Established themselves, and where their Posterity remain unto this day, He Dyed a <HI>Pagan</HI> in the year 912. And was Succeeded by</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Frotho</HI> his Son, though some say <HI>Sueno</HI> his Brother Reigned Nine years. He was twenty years King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> being Converted to Christianity in <HI>England,</HI> and Dyed a zealous Christian, his next Successors was,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Gormo, Gormund,</HI> or <HI>Guthram</HI> (Sur∣naned <HI>Hartesnute,</HI> and <HI>Engelander,</HI> because Born in <HI>England:</HI> He with his Attendants was Baptized at <HI>Aal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> our Learned and Pious King <HI>Alfred</HI> being his Godfather, and gave him the Name of <HI>Athelstanes,</HI> and the Kingdom of the <HI>East-Angles.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Harald</HI> Surnamed <HI>Blaat and</HI> Succeed∣ed his Father <HI>Gormo.</HI> In his days did the <HI>Danes</HI> make that Famous Trench between <HI>Gottorp</HI> and <HI>Sleswick</HI> called <HI>Dannewerk.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Sueno</HI> or <HI>Suenotho,</HI> Surnamed <HI>Tuis∣keg</HI> (that is <HI>Fork'd Beard,</HI>) Succeeded <HI>Harald.</HI> At his first coming to the Crown he was a <HI>Pagan,</HI> and Exercised great Cru∣elty upon the Christians, but was after∣wards
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>Converted to Christianity, and E∣rected three Bishopricks at <HI>Sleswick, Ri∣pen,</HI> and <HI>Arhusen.</HI> He is by some said to have Dyed in the year 1012. and was Buryed at <HI>York,</HI> Others in 1014. and In∣tombed in <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Canutus</HI> the Great, (Son to <HI>Sueno</HI>) He was at once King of <HI>England, Denmark, Sweeden, Norway, Slavonia,</HI> and <HI>Sambland,</HI> some say too, King or Duke of <HI>Normandy.</HI> He was Buryed at <HI>Winchester</HI> in the year 1036. after he had been Seaven and twen∣ty years King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> twenty four of <HI>England,</HI> and Seaven of <HI>Norway,</HI> and was Suoceeded in the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> by his Son.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Hardi-Cnute,</HI> who within four years obtained the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> upon the Death of his Brother <HI>Harald.</HI> He Dyed in <HI>England</HI> in the year 1041. and was Buryed by his Father in the Cathedral of <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Magnus,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> possessed himself of the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> by main force upon the Death of <HI>Hardi-Cnute,</HI> pre∣tending a Contract that Entituled him to it, but had it not long in possession. He Dyed in the year 1048. and left the Crown to</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Sueno Esthret,</HI> Son of one <HI>Ʋlf</HI> an
<PB N="14" REF="12"/><HI>English</HI> Earl. He Departed this Life in the year 1074. and left behind him five Sons, who all of them Enjoyed Succes∣sively their Fathers Crown.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Harald Sueno</HI>'s Eldest Son, Swayed the Scepter no longer then two years, be∣ing an easie efferninate, timerous Prince. So that the <HI>English</HI> laid hold of the Juncture, shook off the <HI>Danish</HI> Yoak without any great trouble.</P>
<P N="14">14. St. <HI>Canutus,</HI> the Second Son of King <HI>Swain</HI> in the year 1088. was Inhumanly Murdered by his own Subject at St. <HI>Albans</HI> Church in <HI>Odensee</HI> (a City in the Isle of <HI>Funen</HI>) which he had made his Sanctua∣ry. Now his Brother <HI>Olaf</HI> longing for the Crown, Fomented a Rebellion against <HI>Canutus,</HI> and effected his designs, by the means of the Kings commanding his Sub∣jects to pay Tyths, according to the Cu∣stom of other Nations. And this Foment∣ed the People into such a Rage by <HI>Olafs</HI> practises, that nothing could appease but their Soveraigns Martyrdome.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Olaf</HI> the Third Son of <HI>Swain</HI> upon the Assassination of St. <HI>Canutus,</HI> was Unani∣mously Declared King by his Partizans. But he and the whole Kingdom were not long before they received their just Pu∣nishment for that Execrable Crime of
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>Murdering their Prince, for Heaven was pleas'd to send so great a Famine over all <HI>Denmark,</HI> that the Kings own Family wanted Bread. <HI>Olaf</HI> well knowing his Crimes had brought that Judgment upon the Realm, offered up his Prayers to God that he would be pleased to divert the Stream of his Vengeance from off the Peo∣ple, upon his Head that had offended; Whereupon the very same Night he Dyed Hungry and Wretched in the year 1096, and the Famine forthwith abated.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Eric Swains</HI> Fourth Son, Surnamed the <HI>Good,</HI> for his Religious Zeal and Piety, Dyed in his Pilgrimage towards <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and was Buried in the Isle of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> in the year 1106. during his Reign <HI>Lunden</HI> in <HI>Schonen</HI> was made an Arch-Bishops See, all the <HI>Danish</HI> Bishops being before that time under the Jurisdiction of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Brement.</HI></P>

Thus, when by the Barbarity and Cruelty of his Reign, He had been compelled to abandon the possession of Three Kingdoms, and had underwent the Miseries of Banishment and Imprisonment for six and Thirty years, He Died wretch∣edly in the Castle of <HI>Kallenburg</HI> in <HI>Zea∣land</HI> in the year 1559. and was succeeded by his Uncle</P>

41. <HI>Frederick</HI> the Third his Son; About the middle of this Princes Reign, his Crown had like to have been taken of his Head by the Victorious <HI>Charles Gustave</HI> King of <HI>Sweeden,</HI> who had reduced him to that Extremity, as that he had nothing more left then his Town of <HI>Copenhaguen,</HI> but the Emperonr, King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and o∣ther <HI>Nothern</HI> Princes, confederating toge∣ther, the King of <HI>Sweeden</HI> was compelled to the Treaty at <HI>Roschild,</HI> which neverthe∣less stripped <HI>Denmark</HI> of many of it's best holds and Provinces; Yet the Crown re∣ceived this advantage as to be made He∣riditary in the present Family, and the People, instead of many Tyrants which they had in the Nobles no more one Master. He Dyed of a Feaver the twenty fifth day of <HI>February</HI> 1669. and that Night the Nobility Swore Allegiance to the New King.</P>
<P N="42">42. <HI>Chrstian</HI> Fifth now Reigning Anactive and Valiant Prince, was Born on the 18th of <HI>April</HI> 1646.

<PB N="24" REF="17"/>their Marriage was performed at <HI>Niccoping</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Falster,</HI> in the Month of <HI>July</HI> in the same year, with all the Splendour and magnificence Imaginable; by this Prin∣cess, the King has a numerous Issue. But before I proceed to give an Account of the Royal Family, it is convenient I first set down, some Circumstances relating to the present King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Person, his Ti∣tle, Arms, Dominions, Patrimony, Reve∣nue, and Strength, his Power, Preroga∣tives, Supremacy, Soveraignty, and Re∣spect. And then I shall proceed to the giv∣ing an Account of the Nobility and Orders of the Knight-hood of that Kingdome, with several other particulars, ending with a Geographical, or rather Topographical, Descriptions of the several Provinces and Places belonging to that Crown. And now first, as to his Person, having alrea∣dy mentioned his Birth, Marriage, and Coronation; Than that he is possessed of all the advantages which Nature or Edu∣cation could afford, which have been so well Seconded by Fortune in several Expeditions into <HI>Schonen</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and the engagements of his Fleets, that he is become the Darling of his People, and the Terror and Admiration of his Ene∣mies.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="17"/>
The King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Title now is King of <HI>Denmark, Norway,</HI> of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandales;</HI> Duke of <HI>Sleswick, Holstein, Stormar,</HI> and <HI>Ditmarsh;</HI> Count of <HI>Olden∣burgh</HI> and <HI>Delmenhorst.</HI> It was much more pompous formerly, when he Swel∣led out the Catalogue of his Dominions, with <HI>England, Sweeden,</HI> and other Provin∣ces.</P>
<P>The Ancient <HI>Cimbrians</HI> are said to have had their Shields and Helmets Painted with the Shapes of several sorts of Wild Beasts, and sometimes used to set a Bra∣zen-Bull upon the top of their Standard, as a token of Strength and Valour. But at this time the King of <HI>Denmark's</HI> Coat is a Complication of Fourteen several Coats, thus ordered.</P>
<P>In a Field <HI>Gules,</HI> He bears a Cross <HI>Ar∣gent</HI> (the Arms of the House of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI>) which quarters the upper part of the Coat into four Cantons; The First of these gives (the Arms of <HI>Denmark,</HI>) <HI>Or,</HI> Six half Hearts <HI>Gules,</HI> three <HI>Lyons Passant,</HI> Guar∣dant <HI>Azure,</HI> with Crowns of the First. This Coat is parted with (the Arms of <HI>Norway</HI>) <HI>Gules,</HI> a Lyon Crowned <HI>Or,</HI> holding in his paws an Hatchet <HI>Argent,</HI> with an haft of the Second. The Second <HI>Canton</HI> carries <HI>Gules,</HI> a <HI>Leopard</HI> in Chief
<PB N="26" REF="18"/><HI>Or,</HI> the Field Sown with nine Hearts of the Second, which are the Arms of <HI>Gothland;</HI> these are parted with <HI>Gules,</HI> a <HI>Dragon</HI> Crowned <HI>Or,</HI> the Ancient Coat of the <HI>Vandals</HI> or <HI>Slavonians;</HI> the Third <HI>Canton</HI> gives <HI>Azure,</HI> Three Crowns <HI>Or,</HI> to De∣note the Union of the Three Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Sweeden.</HI> This Coat is parted with <HI>Gules,</HI> a <HI>Paschal-Lamb Argent,</HI> holding a Cross <HI>Or,</HI> at which hangs a Streamer of the Second, charged with a small Cross of the First. The first Original of this Coat, is said to have been this, In the Year 1218. when King <HI>Waldemar</HI> the Second Engaged in a Sharp and Bloody War with the <HI>Lifelan∣ders,</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> Troops having lost their Standard, began to be disheartned to that Degree, that they gave Ground, and were ready to fling down their Arms, out of dispair, and yield the Victory to the Hea∣thens. When a new Standard of a sud∣dain fell from Heaven, Displaying a White Cross in a Bloody-Flag; At the sight whereof the <HI>Danes</HI> forthwith Ral∣lyed their Forces that were Dispersed, with that Vigour and Courage, as ren∣dered them in a short time Masters of the Field. The Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> kept the Holy Flag in Remembrance of so Mira∣culous
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>a Deliverance, with all the care and Veneration imaginable; Believing their Future Success did in a high Degree depend upon the Safety of so Sacred a Banner. But though the <HI>Danish</HI> Historians do Assert this to be the source of this part of the Arms of their Kings, yet it is much more reasonable to believe that this Banner was bestowed by the Pope upon their King, when he undertook that ex∣pedition into <HI>Lifeland,</HI> since the main De∣sign of that War was the Conversion of those Infidels. But to proceed, the Fourth Canton, bears <HI>Or,</HI> two <HI>Lyons Passant A∣zure,</HI> which are the Arms of <HI>Sleswic,</HI> these are parted with <HI>Gules,</HI> an headless Fish, stuck on a Stake, and Crown'd <HI>Argent:</HI> which is the Coat of <HI>Iseland.</HI> In the Center of these four Cantons, and the middle of the great Cross hangs a Scutcheon bearing <HI>Azure,</HI> a Horse-Man in compleat Armour <HI>Argent,</HI> holding a Sword in his Right-Hand of the same, with the Hilt <HI>Or,</HI> his Horse co∣vered with a Cloath of the Second; which are the Arms of <HI>Dithmarse:</HI> The lower part of the Arms contains four Coats more; Whereof the First is <HI>Gules,</HI> three Pinks, (some call them Nails of our Saviours Passion) and three Leaves of Nettles, which are intermixed, and meet in Angles
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>at the Heart of the Coat; which is charg∣ed with a small Scutcheon <HI>Argent,</HI> for <HI>Hol∣stein.</HI> The Second (which is the Coat of <HI>Stormaria</HI>) is <HI>Axure,</HI> a <HI>Swan Argent,</HI> with a Coronet round her Neck <HI>Or.</HI> The Third (belonging to the County of <HI>Del∣menhorst</HI>) is <HI>Or,</HI> two Bars <HI>Gules.</HI> The Fourth and last Coat (which belongs to <HI>Jutland</HI>) is <HI>Azure,</HI> a Cross Patty, at the bottom of it Achet <HI>Or,</HI> below the Arms is usually hung in a Chain <HI>Or,</HI> the Scutche∣on of the Order of the <HI>Elephant.</HI></P>
<P>The Helmet <HI>Or,</HI> Embroidered and Da∣masked, the sights covered and wanting Bars; above with a Crown <HI>Or,</HI> encircled with four Circles, and Adorned with pre∣cious Stones: On the top of this a Globe <HI>Or,</HI> and above all a Cross Patty <HI>Argent.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Crest</HI> is a <HI>Leopard,</HI> Passant over the Crown <HI>Or,</HI> eight Streamers <HI>Azure,</HI> a plain Cross <HI>Argent;</HI> four Spears bending to the Dexter side, and as many to the Sinister <HI>Or.</HI></P>
<P>Supported by two <HI>Savages,</HI> Crowned and girt with Ivy <HI>Proper,</HI> Armed with two pointed Clubs.</P>
<P>The Mantle <HI>Or,</HI> Sown, with Hearts <HI>Gules</HI> and Lions <HI>Azure,</HI> doubled Er∣mine.</P>
<P>The Ancient Dominions of the King of
<PB N="29" REF="19"/><HI>Denmark,</HI> were of a much Vaster extent than they are at this day, that Crown possessing in the time of <HI>Canutus</HI> the Great, <HI>England, Denmark, Sweeden, Norway, Slavonia, Sambland,</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> with several Islands: Whereas now his swayreach∣es only over <HI>Juitland, Holstein Zealand, Nor∣way, Iseland, Freezland, Greenland,</HI> the <HI>Feroe</HI> and some other Islands of small Note, with the Counties of <HI>Oldenburg, Stormaria,</HI> and <HI>Dithmarsh,</HI> and alterna∣tively <HI>Slezwick,</HI> as shall be shown more at large hereafter, besides some Fortresses and Colonies, in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and upon the Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> have certain Lands Annexed to the Crown, which are inalienable, and in case upon the Neces∣sities of some Junctures, any of them be alienated for the Publick Weale, yet the same Prince, or any of his successours may reunite them again let the consideration be what it will of their Alienation.</P>
<P>But it is no easie matter to State the ac∣count of the yearly Revenue of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which arises from the Rents of Crown Lands, Customes, and Custome Money, Tiths, and other Contingencies some guesse may be made of it from the Customes which are paid by the Mer∣chant-Ships
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>which pass the Sound every day. Every Ship that passes by <HI>Elseneur</HI> must pay a <HI>Rose-Noble</HI> or Four <HI>Rix-Dollars</HI> for every Mast. And it has been observed, that commonly Two hundred Ships, often Four hundred, nay Six hundred pass in one day. Now allowing only 200 to pass dai∣ly, and each pay two <HI>Rose Nobles</HI> or eight <HI>Rix-Dollars</HI> for two Masts, the Sum will Amount to about Four hundred Pounds of our Money, for every day in the year round, and for the whole year to about 134400 Pounds. And the Tax which is paid for such Cattel as are Exported, does not fall much short of this; the Customers Exacting a <HI>Rix-Dollar</HI> for every Beast that goes out of their Kings Dominions.</P>
<P>The chief strength of the King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> consists in the Number and goodness of his Ships and Seamen. And indeed the <HI>Danish</HI> Mariners may vye with the best of Europe, which formerly Rendred them not only particularly succesful by Sea, but also in their Engagements with the <HI>Sweeds</HI> in the last Wars. The Naval Forces of the Crown of <HI>Denmark,</HI> were even for∣merly so considerable; as that <HI>Christian</HI> the Second fitted out a hundred good Men of War for the Succour of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, the <HI>French</HI> King against the <HI>English:</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>Nevertheless this present King has a much larger Fleet of his own alwaies ready for Action. And here I cannot forbear taking Notice of the Bravery and Vigour of our Nation, that was able to carry on a War with Glory, and Fight with success three such Powers confederated together as his most <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty, the King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> and the States General of the Uni∣ted Provinces, nay in so Mortifying a Conjuncture, as when the Burning of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> and the Desolation of the Plague would have enervated any other than <HI>English</HI> Courages, disconcerted their measures, and constrain'd 'em to have complyed with dishonourable Terms. But to return; I will here insert a List of such Men of War of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> as I could get the List off.</P>

<P>With many others, whereof I cannot at present call to mind the Names. The <HI>Danish</HI> Men of War now are Built much fitter for Service than they were formerly, being neither so Large, so Bulky, nor so
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>unweildy as they were in the foregoing Ages, but readier either to Attack, Fly, or Pursue. No Prince in Christendom is bet∣ter Furnished with all things necessary for the fitting out a Fleet, <HI>Norway</HI> and his other Territories; affording him all the Equipage requisite for that purpose. He is also pretty well stored with Sea-men, and indeed all his Dominions being Islands, or Maritime Provinces, the Inhabitants are almost Naturally Mariners. Never∣theless this Monarch is sometimes forced to have recourse to strangers for Recruits of Men; the <HI>Northern</HI> Countreys not a∣bounding so in People as they did in for∣mer times, when they Spawn'd and pour∣ed forth such shoales as over ran not only most parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> but continued their Incursions into <HI>Asia;</HI> But whether this be imputed to the Abolishing of Poligamy, which the Introducing Christianity did re∣form, or that the prevailing of Luxury has debilitated their pristine Vigour, and ren∣dred them the less fit for generation, cer∣tain it is, that no parts of <HI>Europe</HI> are now so thin of Inhabitants, as these <HI>Northern</HI> Regions, and that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has not People enough to Man out so many Ships He would be otherwise ca∣pable to fit out: For without Exhausting
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>or Impoverishing his Coffers, He is able to Build Twelve Men of War every year. And considering the Scarcity of Men, His Land Forces are much more considerable and better Martialized than they have been under some of His latest Predeces∣sors. But before I proceed to particula∣rize them, it will be convenient to set down the Names of the Principal Officers of the Fleet.</P>

<P>With some others, whereof we have not the Names, there being daily Changes made in reforming some, and raising others, making up in all a Body of about 30000 Men.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="23"/>
The Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> since the Reformation made in that State, in the year 1660 hath a Perogative of as large extent as any Monarch in Christendom, having Power without consulting the States, or his Senate to <HI>Declare War, make Peace, send and receive Ambassadors, make Leagues and Treaties with any Foreign States, Issue out Commissions for the Raising of Men both by Sea and Land,</HI> dispose of all Castles, Fortresses, Ports, Havens, Ships of War, Ma∣gazines, Ammunition, and publick Moneys; appoint the Mettal, Weight, Purity and Value thereof, and by His Order can make any Foreign Coyn, to be the cur∣rant Money of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>He can by his Letters Patent, Erect <HI>New Districts, Bishopricks, Ʋniversities, Cities, Burroughs, Colledges, Hospitals, Schools, Fairs, Markets, Courts of Justice, Forrests, Chases, Free-Warrens,</HI> He can Enfranchise an Alien, and render him a <HI>Denison,</HI> Enabling him to purchase Houses and Lands, and bear Offices. He can al∣so lay what Taxes he thinks fitting, upon ihs Subjects without the previous consent of the States or Senate, Rating it District Town or Person at his Pleasure. He can at his Will and Pleasure, Convene, Ad∣journ, Prorogue, Remove the States and
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>the Senate; Grant safe Conduct, Letters of Mart and Reprizal with all the other Perogatives of an Independent Prince, nay, of one whose Will is a Law.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has all such things as are proper <HI>To a Monarch, as Crowns, Scepters, Purple Robe,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ʋnction,</HI> and acknowledgeth no Superiour but God, nor holdeth his Kingdom in Vassa∣lage, nor receiveth his Investiture or In∣stalment from another. Thus at the con∣gress of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> there being a dispute between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Ambassa∣dors, about the Language they were to Treat in, the <HI>French</HI> Insisting to Love both Parties, use <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> Re∣plyed, that if the <HI>French</HI> used the <HI>French,</HI> they would use <HI>Danish;</HI> Being well assu∣red that their Master yielded in nothing to the <HI>French</HI> King, either as to the ex∣tent of his Perogative or of his Dominions. And since the Introduction and Establish∣ment in <HI>Denmark</HI> of the <HI>Augsbourg</HI> Con∣fession, there lyes no Appeal from the King to the Pope, as there does in the Catholick Princes Dominions, but He is Supream Head and Governour, in all mat∣ters as well Ecclesiastical as Civil; so that none of his Subjects whatsoever are ex∣empt from his Jurisdiction and Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="24"/>
Hardly any Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> is looked upon with more Veneration and Respect than this Monarch is by his Subjects, they paying him all those Respectuous Duties, Devoirs and Reverence that a Sovereign can Receive.</P>
<P>But before I proceed any further, I shall give an account of the Royal Family as it Standeth at this day, as also of the Nobi∣lity and other Orders of the Kingdom.

<P>And I shall pass on to the Nobles, who never Claim, nor pretend to the Titles of Dukes, Earls, or Barons, but are such as have had a single Coat of Arms belong∣ing to their Family for many Ages. <HI>Den∣mark</HI> is said to have at this day, some Fa∣milies of that Nobility, of that antiquity as <HI>VVren</HI> and others, as to have been pre∣sent, at the Signing of a Treaty of Peace between <HI>Charles Magne</HI> and the <HI>Danish</HI> King <HI>Hemmines</HI> on the <HI>Eider.</HI></P>
<P>Out of this Body of the Nobility, are drawn the Senators of the Kingdom, or the Members of the Council of State, who are Elected to the Number of 28. All a No∣blemans Goods, moveable and immove∣able are at his Death divided amongst his Children, the Son having two Moities, and
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>a Daughter only one. The King cannot by the Laws of <HI>Denmark,</HI> purchase any part of a Noble-Mans Estate, neither can the Nobles buy any of the Crown Lands, some Officers of the Crown, Knights of the Order of the <HI>Ele∣phant;</HI> Vice-Roys and Governours of Pro∣vinces and Places, were formerly chosen out of the Body of the Nobility, and nominated by the Election of the Senators, bating the Knights of the Order: But at present, since the Reformation of that Kingdom, half of those Officers are drawn out of the Body of the Burgery, the King being willing to consider, and Reward that part of the State, which served with so much Courage and fidelity at the Siege of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> when that Ca∣pital of the Kingdom, was almost the on∣ly place which sustained almost all Efforts of the <HI>Sweedish</HI> Army, which had taken in all the rest of the Kingdom.

<P>Tho till some of late Creation, the <HI>Danish</HI> Nobles had neither the Titles of Dutchies, Marquissates, Counties, nor Barrony, as other States; nor do they Quarter their Armes, yet tis Customary for many of them to be Dub∣bed Knights, upon any Signal piece of Ser∣vice rendred to their Prince or Countrey.</P>
<P>Two Orders of Knight-hood they have in <HI>Denmark,</HI> that of the <HI>Elephant</HI> and that of <HI>Dancbrogh.</HI></P>
<P>That of the <HI>Elephant</HI> was first instituted upon the occasion of King <HI>Christian</HI> the first going in a kind of Pilgrimage to <HI>Rome,</HI> when as he was invested by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fourth with this Order, in Remembrance of our Lord and Saviour, and at the same time it was Ordain'd that the Succeeding Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> should have a Succes∣sive Right to be Soveraigns of this Order. Whereupon the foresaid King <HI>Christian,</HI> Built the Stately Chappel of the three
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>Kings, in the Cathedral at <HI>Roschildt</HI> where the solemnities of the Order were to be held, and the Knights obliged to Assemble, for the choosing a new Member upon the Death of any of their Fraternity. Into the Number whereof several Kings, Prin∣ces and Noble Men have been Admitted. The chief Ensigne of the Order, was the Figure of an <HI>Elephant,</HI> on whose side (within a Rundle) was represented a Crown of Thorns, with three Nails all Bloody; in Honour and Memory of the Passion of our Blessed Saviour. The Knights were obliged to the performance of Acts of Piety, <HI>Alms-deeds,</HI> and certain Ceremonies particularly on those days on which they wore the Ensignes of their Or∣der. Some of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> have been very Zealous to raise the Honour of this Order to the Highest Esteem, and especially their King <HI>John,</HI> who wore the Ensignes of it on every Solemn Festival, and so promoted its value, that our King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, and King <HI>James</HI> the Fifth of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were content to be of the Fraternity. Some <HI>Danish</HI> Writers are not of Opinion, that it re eived its first Insti∣tution, when <HI>Christian</HI> the First had those many Honours conferr'd on him by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fourth, but that the Badge
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>was a meer Millitary Ensigne, formerly bestowed as a Memorial and Incite∣ment to the <HI>Danish</HI> Princes, for the De∣fence and promoting of Christianity a∣gainst the Infidels. Heretofore the Knights wore a Collar of Gold, Composed of <HI>E∣lephants</HI> and <HI>Crosses,</HI> fashioned somewhat like <HI>Crosses Ancrees,</HI> at which Hung the Picture of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> to the middle holding <HI>Christ</HI> in Her Arms, and surround∣ed with a <HI>Glory</HI> of Sun Beams. But at this day they only wear a Blew Ribbond, at which hangs an <HI>Elephant Enamell'd</HI> white, Adorned with four large Diamonds set in the middle. Those <HI>Elephants</HI> worn by the Knights, in the days of <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth, had in the same place within a Circle the Letter <HI>C.</HI> and in the Heart thereof the figure of 4. made to signifie <HI>Christianus Quartus.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Den∣mark</HI> have Generally conferred this Ho∣nour on the days of their Coronation, both upon the Nobles and Senatours of the Kingdome. <HI>Frederick</HI> the Third, brought into use an Embroidered <HI>Glory</HI> of Silver Purl, wrought upon the left side of their Cloak or Vest, on which was Em∣broidered two Crowns within a Rundle, bearing this <HI>Motto, Deus Providebit.</HI> But the <HI>Motto</HI> has changed with the Soveraign,
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>for that of the present King is <HI>Pietate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> justitia;</HI> and this the Knights of his Creation now Wear in the middle of the Circle; B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the Knights of his Fathers making, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obliged to continue still the former <HI>Mott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI></P>
<P>The Order of <HI>Danebroge,</HI> or the Knight of the Holy Cross, was instituted in remem∣brance of the Cross, which is said mira∣culously to have fallen into, and preserv∣ed King <HI>Waldemar</HI> the Second's Army when that having lost their Standard, his Forces were going to yield, and give themselves up a Prey to the Fury of their <HI>Pagan</HI> Enemies the <HI>Lifelanders,</HI> with vvhom they were then Combating. This Or∣der▪ was Continued till the Relique was lost it solfe in <HI>Ditmarsh,</HI> after which it was for a long while wholly laid aside, until revived again in the year 1673. by the present King <HI>Christian</HI> the Fifth. This Prince ordain'd that the Knights of this Order, of which Himself is one, should Wear an Enamell'd Cross Edg'd round with Red, hung in a string of the same Colour, reaching from the Right Shoul∣der to the Left side.</P>
<P>Out of the Nobility, and the Knights, the Senators of the Kingdom were former∣ly chosen, who anciently seldome exceed∣ed
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>the Numbers of Eight, but now are a far greater Number. As long as they con∣tinued in their places, they were main∣tain'd by the Country; They had Castles allowed to dwell in (by the King) paid no Taxes, were only obliged to keep a certain number of Light Horse ready for Service upon all Occasions, and attend upon the King at his Sunimous, upon their own Charges, though not Bound so to do, if he went out of his Dominions, and if sent upon Embassy's, had an Allowance out of the Treasury.</P>
<P>Besides these, were Pensioners, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Services Rendered the Crown, had certain Lands for Life or a set number of Years Assigned them by the King for their Maintenance; In consideration of which, they were to provide so many Light Horse as the King thought fitting, and pay in Annually a certain Sum of Money into the Exchequer. But since the Reformation of the Government in the year 1660. The number of them is very much Retrenched.</P>

It was for∣merly the custom of all the <HI>Northern</HI> Nati∣ons, to have the Genealogies and Famous, Deeds of their Ancestors, put into Dog∣gerell, that being daily chanted over by the Parents to their Children, they might be the easier Remembred and Transmit∣ted to Posterity.

Nay, some for the Reward of a Song, or an Epitaph have been presented with the Crown of <HI>Denmark.</HI> But as it would be an endless matter to set down all the <HI>Danish</HI> Authors, we shall content our selves with Inserting the following Cata∣logue.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="35"/>
<HI>Saxo Grammaticus,</HI> who Writ the History of <HI>Denmark,</HI> in a most Elegant Stile, and Lived in the Twelsth Centuary.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Erasmus Latus,</HI> Professor of Divinity in the University of <HI>Copenhaghen.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Nicolaus Hemmingius</HI> noted for his Ingenious Commentaries upon the Scrip∣ture.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> a <HI>Danish</HI> Nobleman, Fa∣mous for his Admirable Observations in Astronomy.</P>
<P>King <HI>Frederick</HI> the Second, gave him the Island <HI>Ween,</HI> where <HI>Tycho</HI> built his <HI>Ʋrani∣bourg,</HI> about the year 1575 being an obser∣vatory▪ in the form of a Castle, and Fenced round with regular Fortifications, and which he finding a place remote from all troubles, and a fit retirement for a Student, he Adorned it with a Collection of the most exact Mathematical Instruments that could be procured.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Christianus severini Longomontanus</HI> was Bred up in the Science of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> by <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> and has written several Inge∣nious pieces thereof.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Arrild Witfield,</HI> Lord of <HI>Ordersberch</HI> re∣duced, <HI>Saxo</HI>'s History to a Chronological method and Composed an accurate Chro∣nicle of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Nor∣way,</HI> in the <HI>Danish</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="62" REF="36"/>
7. <HI>Stephanus Stephanius,</HI> Professor of Hist∣ory in the University of <HI>Sor</HI> has Illustrated <HI>Saxo Gramaticus</HI> with Ingenious Annota∣tions, and writ an Account of the State of <HI>Denmark</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Christian</HI> the Third.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Olaus Wormius</HI> has made a Rare Colle∣ction of Natural Curiosities, and great dis∣coveries into the Misterious <HI>Runick</HI> Learn∣ing.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Petrus Johannes Resenius,</HI> a great Anti∣quary, as may be seen by His <HI>Edda Islan∣dorum,</HI> and other Curious pieces.</P>
<P>To these may be added, <HI>Petrus Severi∣nus, Borrichius,</HI> the two <HI>Bartholins,</HI> the one of whom <HI>Gasper Bartholinis</HI> supposed to have made the Dial of the Cathedral of <HI>Lunden</HI> in <HI>Schonen,</HI> which Dial shows the Year, Month, Week, Day, and Hour of the Day, all at the same time; with all Feasts both Moveable and fixed, as also the Motions of the Sun and Moon, and their Progress through every Degree of the <HI>Zodiack.</HI> This Clock is so Ordered by Artificial Engines, that when ever it strikes, two Horse-men come forth and Encoun∣ter each other, the one giving the other just so many Blows as the Hammer is to strike upon the Bell: at what time a Door opening, the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> appears, sitting
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>upon a Throne with <HI>Christ</HI> in Her Arms, and the <HI>Magi</HI> doing him Reverence, and two Trumpets Sounding all the while.</P>
<P>And this Register I suppose, is sufficient to show, how much <HI>Denmark</HI> has Contri∣buted towards the Advancement of Learn∣ing.</P>
<P>The Cittizens and Merchants form the Third Order of the Kingdome, and the Peasants or <HI>Rustis,</HI> the Fourth, who are either Freeholders: such as have Hereditary Estates, paying only some small quit Rent to their Land-Lords or <HI>Wornede</HI> Villains, absolutely in the Power of their Lords.</P>
<P>The Cities are Governed by their di∣stinct Corporations. And the Citizens enjoy peculiar Priviledges, and Charters, as in other States of <HI>Europe.</HI> Out of these two last Orders are Elected, the Arch-Bishops, the Bishops, the Canons, Pastours, and Senators of Citties and other: lesser Officers.</P>
<P>Whilst the Kingdome of <HI>Denmark</HI> lay confused and broken into several parts, all the Provinces had not all the same Law, but were Governed by peculiar Statutes. Whence we read of <HI>Leges Scanicae, Leges Sialandice,</HI> and the like. But when they came to be reunited under on Head, they became all Subject to the same Law. The
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>Laws now in use were compiled into one Body, which they call the <HI>Iydse Lowbog,</HI> or the Book of the Laws of <HI>Juitland,</HI> and Established by King <HI>Waldemar</HI> the Second. But nevertheless sometimes changed accor∣ding to the Circumstances of the juncture. Thus Murder was formerly punished, only with a pecuniary Mulct, but now with Death. The Ancient <HI>Danes</HI> were so Zea∣lous, to have their Estates enjoyed by the right Heirs, that they punished Adultery with Death; which Law is still in force in <HI>Sweeden, Saxony,</HI> and many other Parts of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Danes</HI> used formerly, and do still, in some parts of <HI>Juitland,</HI> to Assemble eve∣ry Parish by themselves once a Year in the Fields, to Determine all Controversies by Twelve Select Men, from whom an Ap∣peal lay to the Judge of the Province, upon the inreconciliation of the Parties, and thence to the Supream Court of Justi∣ces, and this custome of a Jury of Twelve Men, was undoubtedly derived to the <HI>En∣glish</HI> from the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>

<PB N="65" REF="37"/>its first Planting, for the confirming the truth of His Doctrine, took up with his bare Hands, Glowing-Hot Barrs of Iron, without the least Harm to the Admiration of all the Beholders. This Miracle wrought a change both in the Religion and Laws of the Realm, for King <HI>Sweno</HI> Ordered that thence forward, all Persons accused of any Hainous Crime, should clear themselves by carrying in their Hands a Glowing <HI>Plow∣share,</HI> or some other piece of Hot Iron.</P>
<P>This kind of purging is called by some of the <HI>Danish</HI> Writers <HI>Jerntegn,</HI> i. e. <HI>Iron∣token;</HI> by others <HI>Ordale.</HI> Our <HI>Saxon An∣cestours</HI> borrowed from the <HI>Danes</HI> several kinds of <HI>Ordale,</HI> as by carrying a Barr of Hot Iron up to the High Alter Bare-Hand; by Treading Bare-foot and Blindfold over a certain number of Glowing Barrs, laid on the ground at unequal distance; by thrust∣ing the Naked Arm into a pot of Boyling Water; and lastly as they use to try Witch∣es, by throwing the accused Party into a River or deep Vessel of cold Water. The First that throughly Abolished all kinds of <HI>Ordale</HI> in <HI>Denmark,</HI> was King <HI>Waldemar</HI> the Second, about the year 1240. at the request of <HI>Pope</HI> Innocent the Third.</P>

<P>And now I shall proceed to the Topo∣graphical Description of each particular Place and Province of the King of <HI>Den∣marks</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cimbrick Chersonese</HI> hath on the <HI>East</HI> the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, on the <HI>West,</HI> the main <HI>German</HI> Ocean, on the <HI>North</HI> a part of the bending into the narrow Streight, called the <HI>Delt,</HI> on the <HI>South,</HI> with the great River of <HI>Albis,</HI> on the <HI>South-East,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="38"/>with the small River of <HI>Trave,</HI> it was so called from the <HI>Kempers,</HI> Men of Vast Bo∣dies and Strength, and whom the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Cimbri,</HI> the <HI>Greeks Cimmeri,</HI> and their Country <HI>Chersonesus Cimbrica,</HI> which Name was given to the whole Tract of Land beyond the <HI>Elb;</HI> the latter Historians con∣fine it to that part only, which now goeth under the Name of <HI>Juitland.</HI></P>
<P>It is in length about 100 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, and 80 in Breadth, and comprehendeth in that extent of Ground, 33 Walled Towns, six Episcopal Sees, (besides those of <HI>Hamburg</HI> and <HI>Lubeck</HI>) which are under the Arch Bi∣shops of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and 20 Royal Castles and Pallaces. It is at present divided into the Dukedom of <HI>Holstein</HI> and the Province of <HI>Juitland.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukedome of <HI>Holstein</HI> went under the General Name of <HI>Nortablingia,</HI> or, the Country beyond the <HI>Elb, Northwards,</HI> and containeth those four Provinces, 1. <HI>Wager∣land.</HI> 2. <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>marse.</HI> 3. <HI>Stormar.</HI> 4. <HI>Ho∣lest</HI> or <HI>Holstein;</HI> Specially so called from the <HI>Dutch</HI> word <HI>Holst,</HI> which signifies a Wood or Forrest, according to the Nature of the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Wagerland</HI> is that part of <HI>Holstein</HI> which lyes on the <HI>South-East</HI> of this <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> and so called from the <HI>Wagriane</HI> a Tribe or

It was made so Head-strong by the Privi∣ledges conferred upon it, by the Dukes of <HI>Holstein,</HI> that it bid defiance to its Sove∣raign, and became a Dukedom of its self; Tho the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> have ever con∣tinued their Claim, and it's thought the present Prince has now a designe of Vigo∣rously Executing his Pretentions. 2. <HI>Sege∣burg,</HI> on the River <HI>Trave,</HI> four <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles from <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and near the Head of that River. 3. <HI>Oldeslo,</HI> on the same River in the midst betwixt both. 4. <HI>Gronneberg,</HI> and 5. <HI>Newkirk,</HI> on the <HI>Baltick</HI>-Shore: And 6. <HI>Stendorp,</HI> more within the Land, near the Edge of a Lake, out of which runs the River <HI>Suentin.</HI> 7. <HI>Ploen</HI> an Ancient City exceedingly well fortified.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="39"/>
In the furthest Corner of <HI>Wagerland</HI> lyes the Ancient and Famous County of <HI>Olden∣burg;</HI> divided from the rest of this Pro∣vince by the River <HI>Brochaw.</HI> It's principal City <HI>Oldenburg,</HI> was formerly the <HI>Metro∣polis</HI> of the <HI>Wagrians,</HI> and <HI>Venedi</HI> a Town of great Trade, and exceeding Populous, but since the Port was stopt up by the com∣mand of Queen <HI>Margaret,</HI> its Splendour has daily lessened, and by the late dreadful Desolation, caused by Thunder and Light∣ning, which laid wast the best and great∣est part of the City, 'tis become now much less considerable than it was before: from the Princes of this Country is derived the Present Royal Family of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Ditmarsh</HI> lyes along the <HI>German Ocean,</HI> Inhabited by People of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Race, who never could be brought under the Dukes of <HI>Holstein,</HI> until <HI>Holstein</HI> it self was annexed to the Crown of <HI>Den∣mark.</HI> The Chief Towns are <HI>Meldorp</HI> up∣on the Ocean, the chief of the Province. 2. <HI>Lunden,</HI> opposite to <HI>Tonningen</HI> near the mouth of the <HI>Eyder.</HI> 3. <HI>Heyde,</HI> a large but poor City.</P>
<P><HI>Stormar,</HI> so called from the <HI>Marshy</HI> Ground lying along the River <HI>Stoer.</HI> The Principal Cities are <HI>Hamburg,</HI> upon the <HI>Bille,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Elb,</HI> an Ancient
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>Town Built in the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> being one of the largest, best Built, most Beautiful and Richest Cities of <HI>Europe.</HI> Upon the Right the Dukes of <HI>Holstein</HI> had to this City, it Swore Allegiance to <HI>Christian</HI> the First, King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which pretentions have upon all occasions been renewed by those Princes, and more particularly after the conclusion of the late Peace with <HI>Sweeden,</HI> when the present King drew his Army about that Town, which though not sufficient to force such a City, yet coming at first as near it as he pleased, by means of the Neigh∣bourhood of <HI>Altena,</HI> raised Batteries for his Artillery and Bombes, with which he might have easily Incommoded the Town. Whereupon several Princes Vigorously In∣terposing for an accommodation, it was pro∣visionally concluded on the First of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> 1679. The Rights of the King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> and of the City of <HI>Hamburg,</HI> Re∣maining as they were, until that the point of Homage, and the other differences, which depended betwixt his <HI>Danish</HI> Majesty and that Town, should in an amicable way be decided by course of Law. Now the chief condition of that accommodation, was an obligation by the Town of <HI>Hamburg</HI> to pay, at five Terms, to his <HI>Danish</HI> Majesty, the Sum of two hundred and twenty thousand
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>Crowns; In consideration whereof that King Remitted the Indignation he had con∣ceived against that Town, Renounced the Pretentions that he had to the Land Jointly possessed by <HI>Hambourg</HI> and <HI>Lubeck;</HI> and promised to restore the Ships, Goods, Com∣modities, and Inhabitants of <HI>Hambourg,</HI> which had been Seized upon the account of these pretentions.</P>
<P>Other Towns of Note are 1. <HI>Gluckstadt,</HI> Built and well Fortified by King <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth, and much improved by His Successors. It commands the passage of the <HI>Elb;</HI> so that it highly concerns the <HI>Ham∣burgers</HI> to be at Peace with the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI> 2: <HI>Crempe,</HI> seated on a small River of the same Name, and is one of the Keys of the Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> 3. <HI>Litzehoa.</HI> 4. <HI>Bredenbourg,</HI> one of the Neatest little Towns in all the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Territories.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Holstein</HI> it self, it taketh up the <HI>Inland</HI> parts between <HI>Stormar</HI> and <HI>Juitland</HI> save that it hath an Out-let into the <HI>Bal∣tick,</HI> on the <HI>South-VVest</HI> of <HI>VVagerland,</HI> the chief Towns are <HI>Kiel,</HI> seated upon a Navigable Arm of the <HI>Baltick.</HI> 2. <HI>Rensbourg</HI> the best fortified Town in the Dukedome. 3. <HI>VVilstor,</HI> a Neat and well Built City. 4. <HI>Niew-Munster,</HI> on the <HI>North-VVest</HI> of the
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>Stor, and not far from the Head of it.</P>
<P>And now for <HI>Juitland,</HI> it comprehend∣eth all that part of the <HI>Cimbrick Chersonese</HI> that is divided from the Dukedom of <HI>Hol∣stein,</HI> by the River <HI>Eyder,</HI> the Ancient boundary betwixt the <HI>Saxons</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> but principally by a long Trench and Wall from one Sea to the other, of such bredth, that a Chariot, or two Horsemen a Breast, might Ride upon it. <HI>Godfrey</HI> King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> first Building this Trench in the time of <HI>Charlemain,</HI> or <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, in Im∣mitation of the <HI>Picts</HI> Wall in <HI>England,</HI> for hindring the Incursions of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> or stopping the Carrier of the said Emperours Victories. The Tract of this Wall being still manifest to be seen, is call d <HI>Dennewark</HI> (or the <HI>Danes</HI> work) to this very day.</P>
<P><HI>Juitland</HI> was so called from the <HI>Juites,</HI> who, together with the <HI>Angli</HI> and Neigh∣bouring <HI>Saxons</HI> made a Conquest of the best part of <HI>Brittain.</HI> But the Ancient In∣habitants of this Province in the time of <HI>Prolomy</HI> and before, were the <HI>Cobandi, Cha∣ly, Phundusi, Charudes,</HI> and in the most <HI>Northern</HI> Tracts the <HI>Cimbri,</HI> of whom the four first were but Tribes or Nations Up∣on that great expedition against <HI>Spain</HI> made by the <HI>Vandals</HI> on the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the <HI>Juits</HI> and <HI>Angli</HI> though fit to Inlarge and
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>shift their Habitations, each taking pos∣session of such quarters as lay nearest to them; Those <HI>Juites</HI> or <HI>Getae</HI> being a Peo∣ple of <HI>Scandia</HI> or <HI>Schonen,</HI> and there placed by <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> for he went up the <HI>Northern</HI> parts of the <HI>Cimbrick Charsonese,</HI> and gave it the Name of <HI>Juitland;</HI> the o∣ther being a People of the <HI>Suevi,</HI> dwelling on the South of the <HI>Elb,</HI> possessed them∣selves of those parts which lay next their old Friends and Confederates the <HI>Saxons,</HI> their chief Town being <HI>Sleswick,</HI> where <HI>Angelen,</HI> now an obscure Village, but of great note in former times, doth preserve their memory. Upon the <HI>Angli</HI>'s joyning with the <HI>Saxons</HI> in the Conquest of <HI>Brit∣tain,</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> took that opportunity of Invading it in the absence of the Natives; and having Conquered it as far as the River <HI>Eyder,</HI> they planted it with Colonies of their own Nation, and made it a part of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Air of this Country is much more mild than that of the other Provinces of these <HI>Northern</HI> Parts, being temperated by the warm vapours of the Sea.</P>
<P>The Soyl of <HI>Juitland</HI> is extremely rich, producing and affording all things neces∣sary for the life of man. The Country being for the most part plain, little swel∣led
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>with Mountains, the Inhabitants reap∣ing this double advantage from their Fields, in that they yield interchangeably both Fish and Corn; for, during one three years they plough the Land, and constantly reap the Fruits of it; and for the next three, let the Pools overflow the Land, to the end the Fish may eat up the Grass (whom they catch as often as they please) and the Mud which is left behind enriches the Soyle.</P>
<P><HI>Juitland</HI> too aboundeth so in Cattle; that sendeth yearly into <HI>Germany</HI> 50000 Oxen, besides great store of Butter, Cheese, Tallow, Hides, Horses and Swine, having such plenty of excellent Hams, that most of those which pass here in <HI>England</HI> under the name of <HI>Westphalia</HI>'s, come from thence. It hath all manner of Game Fowl, either for diversion, necessaries, or luxury. It's Pools, Lakes and Rivers are furnish'd with all sorts of fresh Fish, especially most excellent Salmons, and in great abundance. It's commodious Bays provide with plenty all sorts of Foraign Commodities, as well as the Sea doth <HI>Whitings, Soles, Herrings, Mackeril, Pilchards, Oysters, Smelts, Sprats, Shrimps, Lobsters, Crabs, Thornback, Rusfes, Muscles, Prawns, Cockles, Conge, Turbots, Mades,
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>Scute, Escalops, Cod,</HI> &amp;c. Neither is it wanting of good Fruits. It has excellent Timber, both for building, for Shipping and for Firing. In short, hardly any Country furnishes more towards the neces∣sities, nay, and the amuzement, and the diversions too of life, than this does.</P>
<P>In regard of the Climate, it cannot be expected that its Vines should come to any perfection, they being only to be ripened by the heat of the Sun; but its own Com∣modities procure it the best Wines of all Countries, which nevertheless it does not stand in need of, it producing vast plenty and most excellent Barley, whereof they make their Ale and other Liquors, which if not more toothsome, yet perhaps more natural to their bodies and constitutions.</P>
<P>It likewise Transports into other Coun∣tries great Stores of <HI>Equipage for Shipping, Armors, Ox-hides, Buck-skins, Wainscot, Fir-wood,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Juitland</HI> is divided into <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> the latter containeth many considerable Towns; as first, <HI>Flensbourch,</HI> a deep, safe and commodious Port; <HI>Halem</HI> upon the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, near the mouth of the River <HI>Eyder; Itadersleeve,</HI> a Bishops See; <HI>Sondenberg,</HI> in the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> called <HI>Eyder∣stede,</HI> over against the <HI>Strandt,</HI> an Island
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>of the <HI>German</HI> Ocean; <HI>Sternberg,</HI> the or∣dinary Residence of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Governour <HI>Gottorp,</HI> a strong Castle of the Duke of <HI>Slyvicks</HI> at the end of a large Inlet of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> remarkable for the Toll-Booth; at which Toll is paid one year with another for 50000 Oxen transported out of <HI>North Juitland</HI> into <HI>Germany; Ses∣wick</HI> the principal Town of this Province, an Episcopal See, and the Head of a Duke∣dom.</P>
<P>When <HI>Christian</HI> Earl of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> was chosen King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Dukedom of <HI>Holstein</HI> became part of that Kingdom. Yet so that the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> were reckoned Princes of the Empire, as Dukes of <HI>Holstein,</HI> tho not obliged to repair to any Dyet. Afterwards the title of Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> with a considerable part of the Country, was given to <HI>Adolph Christian</HI> the third brother, who Governed it inter∣changeably with his Brother by turns. Upon the decease of this Duke and his Is∣sue-Male; the title was conferred on <HI>Ʋlric</HI> King <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth's Brother. Since his daies there have been several Houses of the Dukes of <HI>Holstein,</HI> as has been before shown; amongst whom the Duke of <HI>Holstein Gottorp</HI> is chief, and challenges the same power in governing and admini∣string
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>of Justice, as was at first conferred upon Duke <HI>Adolph,</HI> King <HI>Christian</HI> the 3's Brother. In the late Wars, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> forced the present Duke of <HI>Got∣torp</HI> to quit his Dukedom, and abandon all <HI>Holstein</HI> to his Majesties possession. But at the signing of the Treaty between the Kings of <HI>France, Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Fontainbleu, Sept.</HI> 2. 1679. the <HI>Danish</HI> Mi∣nisters promised their Master should at the desire of his most Christian Majesty, restore to the said Duke all his Countrys, Towns and Places, in the same State they were at the signing of the Treaty, with all the Soveraignty that belonged to him, by ver∣tue of the Treaties of <HI>Rosehild, Copenha∣gen</HI> and <HI>Westphalia.</HI> The Duke expected, besides being restored to his Countries, some recompence for the damage his Ter∣ritories had suffered during the War, by the vast sums of Money which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had raised therein, as being one of the best Countries in all the <HI>North,</HI> or at least to have had back the Cannon (being 100 excellent brass pieces.) But his expe∣ctations in this point were not answered.</P>
<P><HI>North Juitland</HI> hath on the <HI>South</HI> the Dukedom of <HI>Sleswick</HI> but surrounded by all other parts by the Sea, is divided into 4 Diocesses or <HI>Districts:</HI> that of <HI>Rip</HI> or <HI>Ri∣pen,</HI>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4. That of <HI>Alburg</HI> or <HI>Vandalia,</HI> which is subdivided into four parts, as 1. <HI>Thyland,</HI> whose chief Town is <HI>Alborch</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Vandalia</HI>'s usual Seat and Residence. 2. <HI>Morsce</HI> containing three <HI>Herets,</HI> the Town of <HI>Nicoping,</HI> the Castle of <HI>Lunsted,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Ageroe.</HI> 3. <HI>Hanheret</HI> containing four <HI>Herets,</HI> the Town of <HI>Thystad,</HI> a kind of University, the Castle of <HI>Orum,</HI> and the Islands of <HI>Oland</HI> and <HI>Oxholm.</HI> In this <HI>Di∣strict</HI> standeth the Rock called <HI>Skaringclint,</HI> serving for a Sea Mark to prevent Mari∣ners running against the Quick-sands which
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>lye about this Coast. 4. <HI>Wensyssel, Vensi∣lia</HI> or <HI>Wenslie</HI> containeth six <HI>Herets</HI> or <HI>Pre∣fectures.</HI> The Islands of <HI>Grosholm</HI> of <HI>Herts∣horn,</HI> and <HI>Tidesholm,</HI> one Castle and three Towns; the most remarkable of which is <HI>Scagen,</HI> standing at the utmost Promon∣tory, or most Northerly Point of all this <HI>Chersonese,</HI> being notorious for the Ship∣wrack of many Ships of all Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Zealand</HI> the largest, fairest, and most fertil Island in the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, lies <HI>East</HI> of <HI>Juitland,</HI> from which separated by an arm of the Sea, called the <HI>Belt</HI> and <HI>West</HI> of <HI>Schonen,</HI> from which it is parted by a fresh River not above a <HI>Dutch</HI> Mile in breadth, commonly called by the name of the <HI>Sund</HI> or <HI>Sound.</HI> This Island being about twelve <HI>German</HI> Miles broad, and eighteen long.</P>
<P>It was anciently called <HI>Codanonia,</HI> which signifies the same thing as the modern words <HI>Danes</HI> or <HI>Denmark.</HI> Many of the <HI>Danish</HI> Etymologists derive <HI>Seeland</HI> from <HI>Sordland</HI> or <HI>Seedland</HI> from the abundance of Corn which this Country affords. O∣thers with greater Probability make the word signifie no more than an Island or parcel of Ground encompassed with the Sea.</P>
<P>This Island containeth 15 Cities or Wal∣led Towns, the principal whereof are <HI>Co∣penhagen</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="45"/>(the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of this Island and of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which is seated on the <HI>East Part</HI> of <HI>Zealand</HI> up∣on the Sea shore. The <HI>Danes</HI> call it <HI>Kio∣benhaun,</HI> and the <HI>Germans Copenharen,</HI> both which words are corruptions of <HI>Ki∣obm inshaven,</HI> or the <HI>Kaven of Merchants.</HI> The Town is of an Orbicular form, and very well fortified since the War in 1659. with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> having an <HI>Arcenal</HI> which perhaps excels any thing of that kind in <HI>Europe;</HI> In the <HI>Arcenal</HI> is kept a Coach with springs, by which means it goes as if it were of it self, and of its own move∣ment; but the Artifice of this Work de∣pends on two men hidden under a cover∣ing in the Coach, of whom the one turn∣ed the Wheels, which pushed it on, and the other guided it by the means of a Rud∣der in the Head. Its Cathedral Church dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> is beautified with a noble Copper Spire, built at the charges of King <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth. The <HI>Advow∣sance</HI> of this Church belongs to the Profes∣sors in the Universitie which was founded by <HI>Ericus</HI> the Ninth, but perfected by King <HI>Christian</HI> the First: by him and the succeeding Princes liberally endowed. The City is Governed by four Burgo-masters, one whereof is Regent or President for his
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>life. This Honour is conferred at present on that deserving and learned Person <HI>P. John Resenius</HI> Professour of Moral Phylo∣sophy in the University at <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and Counsellour to the present King of <HI>Den∣mark.</HI> Amongst the Ornaments of the Town are the Market-place, which is ex∣ceeding spacious; the King's Palace all covered with Copper, standing in an Island, wherein is kept a Ship of Ivory, wholly fitted, whereof the Tackling, Sails and Cannons were entirely of Ivory being an extraordinary fine piece of Ma∣nufacture. The Observatory, or <HI>Runde Toorn</HI> which is very remarkable, and especially for the fashion of its Stair-case, if we may call it so, which is nothing but a Pavement which mount singeniously with∣out Steps; and it is so very broad a Coach may easily go up to the top, and there too it has room enough to turn in. This Tower was built on purpose for the use of Astronomers, and out of it you go into a fine Library which stands on the side of the Tower. There is Marks of the Siege to be seen, which the <HI>Swedes</HI> laid to this City; amongst others, a Bell made so full of holes by Cannon Bullets, that the King has thought fitting the marks thereof should remain visible by causing all the
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>places that were pierced to be guilt. The <HI>Exchange</HI> is richly worth the seeing, and will merit a more ample Description than this Compendium of the whole Kingdom will admit. The Citizens Houses, till within these few years were very mean and low, most of them patcht up of Wood and Mortar; indeed the first rise of this City was but very mean, for about the year 1168. <HI>Axil Wide</HI> sirnamed <HI>Snare</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Denmark,</HI> built a conside∣rable Fortification in this Island, wherein now stands the Castle. This was called after his Name <HI>Axel-huys;</HI> and was a good defence to the whole Island against the daily incursions of Pyrats. Under the protection of this Fort several Fishermen, and others that Traded this way, used to Harbour their Ships in security; this caused a continual concourse of the Natives, who resorted hither to furnish the Vessels with such Provisions as their Country afford∣ed; and in a short time laid the first rude Draughts of a City, which at this day for Strength, Trade, Beauty and Bulk is not surpassed by many in <HI>Europe;</HI> for of late the Citizens are grown more curious, and experienced in Architecture, and few of their Streets are without a considerable number of stately brick Buildings. Its Haven also being one of the best in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HI>Amaga Amagri</HI> is <HI>Amagra</HI> or <HI>Ammak,</HI> is a small Island on the East of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> about six <HI>English</HI> Miles in length and four in breadth; it abounds wonderfully in all manner of Fowl and Venison, has in it plenty of Corn, and furnishes the Market at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> with weekly supplies of Milk, Butter, Cheese, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Isle of <HI>Ammak</HI> contains four or five Villages, and has two Parish Churches. But before we leave this Island, it will not perhaps be un∣grateful to relate an Encounter which hap∣pened in it at the Siege of <HI>Copenhagen</HI> in 1660. which was so much the more consi∣derable, because both the <HI>Northern</HI> Kings were personally engaged in the action. The <HI>Swede</HI> observing that the <HI>Dane</HI> daily fetched Provisions from the aforementi∣oned Isle, the <HI>Ammak</HI> was resolved to make a Descent in order to burn the Vil∣lages, and destroy whatever might afford sustenance or relief to the besieged; for which purpose he put aboard about 1200 Foot, and 400 Horse; and the King himself would needs be of the Party, think∣ing nothing so well done as where he was present, as well as naturally ambitious of sharing personally in the glory of every brave action. Coming to the height of the <HI>Draker,</HI> he forced his Landing upon
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>the Point of the Isle, and constrained them upon the Guard to abandon their Post. He marches up the Isle, and destroys all before him; and the <HI>Danes</HI> fearing he came to fortifie some Post on that side, set fire to the Village next adjacent to the Town, as the <HI>Swede</HI> had done to the rest. Having done this work, the <HI>Swede</HI> retreats to his Boats too securely: some scattered from the Body, others encumbred with Plun∣der. Mean while the <HI>Danish</HI> King Sallies out in person with three hundred Horse, and two hundred Dragoons, besides some few Commanded Foot mounted behind, falls in upon the <HI>Swedish</HI> Rear, flew seve∣ral of them, and put the rest in disorder. The <HI>Swedish</HI> King mounted upon an un∣ruly Horse, bounding and curveting with him, ran great hazard of falling that day into the <HI>Danish</HI> hands. But the <HI>Dane</HI> ei∣ther not knowing all his advantages, or not willing to be drawn too far from his Town, by an over eager pressing upon an Enemy who out numbred him, sounded a seasonable retreat.</P>
<P>The next place of Note is <HI>Roschild,</HI> which takes its name from a River run∣ning by the Town, which drives <HI>scaven</HI> Mills; It was formerly the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the whole Kingdom, fortified with a Wall,
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>Ditch and Bulwark, and contained no less than 27 fair Churches. This Town was made a Bishop's See by <HI>Suenotho</HI> King of <HI>England, Denmark, Sweden</HI> and <HI>Norway</HI> about the year 1012. who gave the Bi∣shoprick of <HI>Roschild</HI> (which is now swal∣lowed up by <HI>Copenhagen</HI>) to <HI>Gerebrand</HI> a Monk. In the Cathedral Church of this Town, are to be seen very fair and sump∣tuous Tombs of many of the <HI>Danish</HI> Kings.</P>
<P><HI>Elseneur,</HI> the chief Ornament and Strength of which Town lies in <HI>Cronen∣burg,</HI> is seated on that neck of the Sea cal∣led <HI>Orisundt</HI> or the <HI>Sound,</HI> which parts <HI>Sealand</HI> from <HI>Schonen. Cronenburgh</HI> is built of hewn Free-stone, brought hither out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this undertaken with incredible pains and charge by King <HI>Fre∣drick</HI> the Second, without a penny Subsi∣dy from the Subjects, tho he covered it with Coper; the Foundation of it being laid on huge Stone sunk into the Sea, and so fastened together, that no Storm or Tempest, how violent soever, is able to shake it; well fortified as well as founded, and mixt of a Palace and of a Fort, having for many years been the Seat of the <HI>Danish</HI> Kings, who had from hence one of the most pleasant and profitable prospects of the whole Kingdom: every Ship that
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>passes this Streight, being obliged to strike Sail to <HI>Croneburg;</HI> and that done, the Master is to come to a Composition in the City for Custom, upon the pain of the Confiscation and Loading.</P>
<P><HI>Fredericksberg</HI> seated amongst pleasant Woods of Beech, and about the middle way between <HI>Elseneur</HI> and <HI>Copenhagen;</HI> this Fabrick was first began by one <HI>Harlef</HI> a <HI>Danish</HI> Nobleman, who sold it to King <HI>Fredrick</HI> the Second, who fell upon en∣larging and beautifying it to a high de∣gree. After this King's death, his Son <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth spared no charges in compleating what his Father left unfinish∣ed, adorning it with the richest Pictures, Statues, Hangings, the Locks and bars in the Windows being all of beaten Silver, so as it not only surpasses all that is in the North: but the World can hardly para∣lel this piece. The adjoyning Park has amongst other Foreign Beasts a Stock of Foreign Deer transported hither out of <HI>England</HI> in the 24 of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ringstede,</HI> a Town of the greatest Anti∣quity of any except <HI>Roschild</HI> in <HI>Denmark;</HI> many of the <HI>Danish</HI> Kings lying buried in the place, particularly King <HI>Waldemar</HI> the First, and <HI>Eric</HI> the Godly; its scituation being in the very Center of the Land; its
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>want of Trade, makes it daily decay.</P>
<P><HI>Sora</HI> of old being beautified with a goodly Monastery, the Revenues where∣of, at the alteration of Religion, were converted to the maintenance of a Free-School built here by <HI>Fredrick</HI> the First. But in the year 1623. <HI>Christiern</HI> the fourth adding hereunto the Revenues of two other dissolved Monasteries, the one of the Isle of <HI>Laland,</HI> and the other in <HI>Juitland,</HI> founded here a new University for the maintenance of several learned men, who were to be employed in writing and pub∣lishing the History of the Acts and Monu∣ments of the Kings, and other Heroes, of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and for the better supply of Learned Ministers for the Churches of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway</HI> (which before could not be provided for out of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and furnished it with men of eminence in all Arts and Sciences for its first Professors. Besides, he annexed an Academy with fit Masters, to teach perfectly all Gentile and Marshal Exercises, as Dancing, Vault∣ings, Riding the Great Horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anderskaw</HI> or <HI>Andershauw,</HI> formerly a great Monastery, now a strong Castle about an <HI>English</HI> Mile from <HI>Slagen.</HI> It is is seat∣ed in a level Champaign Country, and delicately well built.</P>

<HI>Kallenburg</HI> was formerly a small Vil∣lage inhabited by none but Fisher-men, but about the year 1158. or I as some, 117. it was turned into a City, and beautified with a Castle, Church and several other publick Buildings. 'Tis at present a Town of good Trade, having the conve∣nience of as safe an Harbour for Ships as any Haven in <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Korsor,</HI> so called from the Multitude of Crosses erected formerly in the places out of the abundance of superstitious zeal in the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>Koge,</HI> a small but very rich and popu∣lous City; about sixteen <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> It is a place much thronged with Corn Merchants, and Fish∣mongers, driving a considerable Trade, and being in a pleasant situation.</P>

<P><HI>FƲnen</HI> is Situated betwixt <HI>Seeland</HI> and <HI>Juitland,</HI> from which last it is parted by a Straight, called <HI>Middlefar-sundt,</HI> about one <HI>German</HI> Mile in breadth, and separa∣ted from <HI>Seeland</HI> by the <HI>Beltis sundt,</HI> or <HI>Baltick Bay,</HI> which is so narrow and small a Frith, that the Island and the <HI>Chersonese</HI> seem joyned together.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="49"/>
The length of this Island from East to West is Ten <HI>German</HI> Miles, and the breadth Eight: It is looked upon as the Pleasantest piece of Ground in the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Dominions; abounding besides with all manner of Corn, espe∣cially Wheat and Rye, which is hence Yearly Transported in great Quantities unto other Nations. Besides, the Natives have generally great Herds of Cattel, and good Breeds of Horses. The Woods, which overspread almost the whole Island, are exceeding well stored with Deer, Hares, and Foxes. This Island contains Four and Twenty <HI>Herets</HI> or <HI>Prefectures,</HI> Sixteen Towns, and Six Royal Castles, besides many goodly Villages and Gen∣tlemens Houses.</P>
<P>The Chief City of <HI>Funen</HI> is <HI>Ottensee,</HI> seated in the very center of the Island, and therefore a fit place for the Sessions of the Nobility and Magistracy, which are Yearly held in this place; as were like∣wise the General Assemblies of the King∣dom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> before the Year 1660. The Buildings in this Town are generally well Built, and the Streets Uniform.

<HEAD>ZALAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LAland,</HI> or <HI>Lawland,</HI> so called from its low Situation, is disjoyned from <HI>Seeland</HI> by a little narrow Straight, called <HI>Gronesendt,</HI> and is about Thirty two <HI>English</HI> Miles in length, and two in breadth. This is a very Fruitful Coun∣trey, hath good store of Rich Pasturage, and affords such great Plenty of Corn and Chesnuts, that Ships full Freighted with them are sent Yearly hence.</P>
<P>It contains four <HI>Herets</HI> or Lordships, and as many Cities. The great Towns or Cities are, 1. <HI>Naschaw,</HI> or <HI>Nashscouw;</HI> which (together with the adjoyning Mo∣nastery) was Stormed, Taken, and Burnt by the <HI>Lubeckers</HI> in the Year 1510. 2. <HI>Sas∣coping.</HI> 3. <HI>Newstadt,</HI> once Famous for a Noble Monastery Built there <HI>A.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Nicoping,</HI> which, for the Elegancy of the Place, and the Pleasantness of the Situation, is by Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> styled, <HI>The NAPLES of Denmark.</HI> 2. <HI>Stubcopen,</HI> or <HI>Stabcoping,</HI> has some Trade upon the Account of its being the Ordinary Passage between <HI>Seeland</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Langeland,</HI> a narrow Island betwixt <HI>Funen</HI> and <HI>Laland,</HI> seven <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles in length; in which, besides many Villages and Gentlemens Houses, and sixteen Pa∣rish Churches, is the Town of <HI>Rudcoping,</HI> and the Impregnable Castle of <HI>Traneker,</HI> which is admirably well provided with all manner of Military Ammunition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Mona,</HI> or <HI>Meun,</HI> a Chalky Island to the North-East of <HI>Falster:</HI> It serves for a good Land-mark to the <HI>German</HI> Vessels that Trade in those Seas.

<ITEM><PB N="94" REF="52"/>
4. <HI>Alsen,</HI> another little Island, called in <HI>Latin, Elysia,</HI> opposite to the Gulph or Bay of <HI>Flensburg,</HI> in the Dukedom of <HI>Sleswick,</HI> of which it is a part, and therefore only Subject to the King of <HI>Den∣mark</HI> as Dukes of <HI>Sleswick.</HI> Some <HI>Danish</HI> Antiquaries do think the <HI>Elesii, Arii,</HI> and <HI>Manimi,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> were the Ancient Inhabitants of this Island <HI>Ar</HI> and <HI>Meun;</HI> and that these three Isles have the same Names at this day (with some small alteration) which they had when <HI>Tacitus</HI> writ his Annals. It is well stored with Beasts for Profit, and Game for Pleasure; and so Populous, that several Thousands of stout Fighting Men have been Raised in a very short time out of its four Towns and Thirteen Parishes. The Principal place of the Island, is the Town and Castle of <HI>Sunderburg,</HI> was heretofore one of the Ordinary Residences of the Dukes of <HI>Sleswick,</HI> and Honoured with the Birth of many of their Princes of the Royal Family, and is at this day one of the strongest Holds which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> stands possessed of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Femeren,</HI> or <HI>Fimbriu,</HI> is a small Island on the Coast of <HI>Wagerland,</HI> from which it is separated by a very narrow Channel. This Plot of Ground has ever

And therefore in the Year 1628, King <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth took care to put strong Gari∣sons into every place of Moment in it, and to Fortifie the Old Castles and Towns which his Predecessors had suffered to decay and slighted.

<ITEM>6. <HI>Hucen,</HI> or <HI>Wcen,</HI> commonly called by the <HI>English</HI> the Scarlet Island, as is said upon the account of a Bargain between Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and the King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> she being to have the Island for as much Scarlet Cloth as would cover it.

<HEAD>NORWAY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NORWAY</HI> is bounded in the <HI>South</HI> with the <HI>Baltick</HI> Straits, which se∣parate it from <HI>Juitland;</HI> on the East with <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> from which it is parted by a perpetual Ridge of rough and wild Mountains, called the <HI>Dofrine</HI> Hills; in the North and West with the <HI>Northern</HI> Ocean: the whole length of it, from the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea as far as <HI>Finmark,</HI> is reckoned to be about Eight hundred and forty <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>As for the Derivation of its Name <HI>Norway</HI> (or <HI>Norweg</HI> as the <HI>Germans</HI> write it; whence the Latin word <HI>Norwegia</HI>) is only <HI>Via seutractus septentrionalis;</HI> i.e. A Countrey scituated towards the North. Hence in the <HI>Danish, Swedish,</HI> and <HI>Norwe∣gian</HI> Tongues, 'tis to this day called <HI>Nor∣rike,</HI> or the <HI>Northern</HI> Kingdom; and we find that anciently all the Northern Kingdoms were called <HI>Regna Norica.</HI></P>
<P>As for its Position, in regard of the Heavens, it reacheth from the first Parallel, of the Twelfth Clime, where the Pole is elevated 58 Degrees, 20 Minutes, as far as to 71 of Latitude, by which ac∣count the longest day in the <HI>Southern</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>Point is but 10 Hours: Whereas at <HI>Ward∣buy</HI>'s, being situate farthest <HI>North</HI> of all this Countrey, they have no Night for almost Three Months together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eastern</HI> Part of <HI>Norway</HI> is very thinly inhabited, being a Country of no∣thing but inaccessible Craggy Mountains; towards the <HI>South</HI> it is better peopled, the Inhabitants dwelling in pleasant Val∣leys incircled with delightful Hills; the rest of the Countrey is over-spread with Woods, which afford most part of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> Deal Boards and Masts for Ships.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dofrine</HI> Hills which divide this Realm from <HI>Sweden,</HI> are perpetually co∣vered with Snow; and send down in∣tollerable bitter Winds into the Valleys beneath, which renders 'em desolate and unfruitful. But the Air of the more <HI>Western</HI> Coasts of this Kingdom is much more milder and temperate, and would be healthful too, were not the Countrey troubled with certain little Beasts which they call <HI>Lemmers:</HI> they are about the the bigness of a Field-Mouse, and are by the Inhabitants said to drop out of the Clouds in bad Weather; they devour like the Locust every green thing on the Earth; and at a certain time die all in heaps (as it were) together, and with their stench and putrefaction so poisonthe Air, that
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>the poor people are long after troubled with the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> and a Giddiness in the Head, which is most especially apt to seize on Strangers unacquainted with the danger, and unprepared against the Di∣stemper: But the <HI>Lemmers</HI> do not more frequently infest the Land, than the <HI>Whales</HI> do terrifie and molest the Sho res; yet the Mariners and Inhabitants of the Sea-Coasts have found out a Remedy a∣gainst their Violence and Fury, for they mingle some Water with the Oyl of <HI>Ca∣stor,</HI> the smell whereof doth force 'em to retire immediately; had not this help and expedient been found out, there would be no Fishing upon the Coasts of <HI>Nor∣way:</HI> which with Materials for Shipping is the greatest staple Commodity of the Country.</P>
<P>Their Valleys are well stock'd with good Breeds of Cattle, which enable the Inhabitants to Export every year great abundance of Butter, Tallow, Hides, and Cheese; Barley is their chief Grain. Their Woods furnish Timber, Pitch, Tar, Rich Furs, and vast plen∣ty of <HI>Filbirds:</HI> They also drive a great Trade with their <HI>Train-Oyl</HI> and <HI>Stock Fish,</HI> which is vended over all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1623. <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> put several Artists up∣on
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>the search of some <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver Mines,</HI> and they are said to have found some Lumps of the Ore of both those <HI>Metals,</HI> which they Presented to that Prince. But whether the Ores lying so deep, it would not quit Costs, or that the thinness or ignorance of the Inhabi∣tants, in refining of Minerals themselves, with their jealousie and unwillingness to admit any Forreigners skill'd in that way into their Countrey; this Diicovery ne∣ver turned to any considerable Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>Norwegians</HI> jump much with the <HI>Danes</HI> in their Complexion and Humour, but are generally more effeminate and lazy; yet not naturally so, but thro want of Employment and Exercise. The Policy of the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> not thinking fit to employ this Nation in a∣ny Wars, for fear of enuring 'em, and making them expert in <HI>Arms.</HI> And thro this Umbrage, takes <HI>all</HI> the Courses im∣aginable to Cow and dispirit them. Now tho the ancient <HI>Norwegians</HI> are said to have been notorious Pyrats; yet at this day hardly any Seas are less infested with Pyracy than those of <HI>Norway.</HI> Not that the Modern Inhabitants are blest with more Honesty than their Ancestors, but the <HI>Danish</HI> sway is so rigorous, as not to allow them any Shipping, nor
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>any other means to pamper, grow resty, and head strong, but on the contrary fleeces, squeezes, and keeps them in the lowest servitude.</P>
<P>Their Diet is what they Export to o∣ther Countreys, principally Stock Fish, and a course kind of Butter and Cheese, Their usual Drink <HI>Rostock</HI> Ale, their man∣ner being commonly to drink three Draughts; one in remembrance of God, the second to the Kings Health, and the third to the Queens.</P>
<P>As the Towns in <HI>Norway</HI> are very thin, so the Buildings for the most part are very poor and miserable; generally patched up of dirt and hurdles, some∣what resembling our Cotrage Houses in the Fen Countreys.</P>
<P>As for the Government of this Coun∣trey, it is still reckoned a distinct King∣dom from that of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and had formerly Independant Kings of its own, who sometimes domineer'd over the ve∣ry Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI> But the last King of the <HI>Norwegian</HI> Race, who Reigned in their Kingdom, was <HI>Haguin;</HI> who in the year 1363 Married <HI>Margaret</HI> Eldest Daughter of <HI>Waldemar</HI> the third, King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and so united the two Crowns. Now tho this King had only one Son by Queen <HI>Margaret,</HI> who died
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>without Issue, yet the <HI>Danes</HI> having once got footing in, and possession of this Kingdom, were resolved not to abandon such an advantage, nor part from their Station; and to secure it, immediately clapt strong Garrisons into all the Cities and Fortresses of moment in the Nation. For the better Management of the Go∣vernment, it is divided into five Prefe∣ctures answerable to the five Castles which command them.</P>
<P>Now 1. The Prefecture of <HI>Masterland</HI> or <HI>Maestrandt</HI> is situated most towards the South, and is commanded by the Ca∣stle of <HI>Bahuy's,</HI> now in the hands of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> That <HI>Castle</HI> was first Built by <HI>Haguin</HI> the IV. King of <HI>Norway,</HI> about the year 1309, upon a steep Rock on the Bank of the River <HI>Srollet,</HI> and then esteem'd the best Fort the King had in his Dominions; and a sufficient Barrier against the frequent Attacks and Inroads of the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Westro-Goths:</HI> Besides the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Maestrandt</HI> noted for the in∣finite quantity of Herrings caught there∣about, there's two more of less note, <HI>Con∣gal</HI> and <HI>Oldawalt.</HI></P>
<P>The 2. Prefecture contains the Bisho∣pricks of <HI>Anslo</HI> and <HI>Staffenger,</HI> with the Province of <HI>Aggerhuys,</HI> having under its Command, first the Towns of <HI>Anslo, Op∣slo,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>or <HI>Asloia,</HI> possess of most repute, as being an Episcopal See, and the place where the Courts of Judicature are kept for all <HI>Norway.</HI> All Causes and Suits at Law being heard and determined before the Governour, who acts as <HI>Vice Roy</HI> of the Kingdom. The Cathedral of this Town is dedicated to <HI>Alward,</HI> who took great pains to Convert the <HI>Norwegian Pagans.</HI> This Church has to show the Sword of <HI>Haquin,</HI> one of their most Primitive Kings, being a signal Instance and Proof of the Strength and admirable Art of some <HI>Norwegians</HI> of former Ages. The Hilt of it is made of Chrystal curiou∣sly wrought and polished; whence some have inferred that the use of Chrystal was anciently much more ordinary in <HI>Norway,</HI> than it is at this day in any part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Opslo</HI> on the opposite side of the <HI>Bay</HI> stands the Castle of <HI>Aggerhuysen;</HI> famous for the brave resistance it made the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army in the Year 1567, which laid a close and brisk Seige to it for Eigh∣teen Weeks together; but was at last beat off and forced to a shameful Retreat. <HI>Tons∣berg</HI> formerly a place of Retreat of the Kings of <HI>Norway, Hammer</HI> in former times a Bishops See, but now united to that of <HI>Op∣slo.</HI> Some Authors do affirm that near unto <HI>Hammer</HI> a huge and monstrous Serpent

<P>The City of <HI>Staffenger</HI> lies in 59 deg.

<P>Beyond the <HI>Bay</HI> is seen the Island <HI>Schute∣nes,</HI> Twelve <HI>English Miles</HI> in length, but scarce two in breadth: This Island con∣tains several Villages, and between it and

<P>The Province of <HI>Tillemarch</HI> or <HI>Thyle∣march,</HI> appertaineth to the Bishoprick of <HI>Staffenger.</HI> The Parish or <HI>Hollen,</HI> in this Parish is very remarkable for a Church-Yard or Burying Place, on the top of a Church, Dedicated to St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which is cut out of a great high Rock, called by the Neighbourhood <HI>Vear,</HI> upon the Lake <HI>Nordsce,</HI> half a Mile distant from <HI>Scheen;</HI> 'tis thought by some to have been former∣la a <HI>Heathenish</HI> Temple, but converted to <HI>Christian</HI> uses upon the first planting of the Gospel in this Kingdom.</P>

<P><HI>Berghen</HI> is the Granary and Magazine of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Norway,</HI> for <HI>Bahuys,</HI> it is distant about Fourty hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles by Sea, and Two hundred

Some <HI>Etymologists</HI> have de∣rived its Name from the <HI>Norwegian</HI> Verb <HI>Berghen,</HI> which signifies to hide or conceal; because the Haven being surrounded with Hills, seems to be a kind of Sculking place for Ships, where Vessels of <HI>Two hundred Tun</HI> and upwards, ride in a spacious and most secure Harbour, free from any danger of Wind and Weather. But the true deriva∣tion of the word is this, <HI>Berghen</HI> in the <HI>Nor∣wegian Tongues</HI> also signifies Mountains, and <HI>Bergenhuysen</HI> a Company of Houses among the Hills. The Buildings of this <HI>Town</HI> till of late were but very mean and despise∣ble, for the most part of Wood covered with <HI>green Turf,</HI> and so often burnt down. But the Forreigners that have traded thi∣ther, within these few years have adorn'd the Town with an Exchange, and many goodly private Houses; the principal <HI>Com∣modity</HI> which <HI>Berghen</HI> Trades in, is <HI>Stock∣fish,</HI> which they catch upon those Coasts in Winter, commonly in <HI>January,</HI> for the con∣veniency of drying it in the cold and sharp <HI>Air,</HI> besides all sorts of <HI>Furrs,</HI> and vast quantities of <HI>dried Fish, Butter, Tallow, Hides,</HI> &amp;c. are brought hither from all parts of <HI>Norway</HI> to be Imported into For∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

<P>The Prefecture and Bishoprick of <HI>Trun∣thein</HI> is reckoned the fourth Government in <HI>Norway,</HI> and its <HI>City</HI> anciently called <HI>Ni∣drosia,</HI> was formerly the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the whole Kingdom, &amp; the Seat of the <HI>King</HI> &amp; <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Norway.</HI> It was in former times a beautiful City, but being burnt down in the year 1522, and kept in such subjection and oppression by the <HI>Danes,</HI> it has been so far from being able to receive its primitive Splendor, that it seems more like a <HI>Village</HI> than a <HI>City.</HI> Yet something of the ancient <HI>Grandeur</HI> still appears in the <HI>Cathedral</HI> de∣dicated to St. <HI>Ilaus,</HI> which (though almost consumed by <HI>Fire</HI>) by the <HI>Ruins,</HI> shews it self to have been one of the most <HI>Magnifi∣cent</HI> and <HI>largest Fabricks</HI> in the <HI>World.</HI> In this <HI>Church</HI> the <HI>Huntsmen</HI> were wont to make a yearly <HI>Offering</HI> of the Skins of the largest and stoutest <HI>White Bears</HI> which they kill'd, for the <HI>Priests</HI> to tread upon at <HI>Divine Ser∣vice. Greenland</HI> and <HI>Iseland,</HI> were formerly Districts of the Diocess of <HI>Truntheim,</HI> but this Bishoprick is now confined within nar∣rower bounds: Most part of this Country having no Wood at all growing in it, make
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>use of <HI>Fish bones</HI> for Fuel, for Timber to build their Houses, and for several <HI>Imple∣ments</HI> of <HI>Houshold Stuff:</HI> And with the <HI>fat</HI> of those same <HI>fish</HI> they <HI>feed</HI> their <HI>Lamps</HI> in <HI>Winter.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth and last Prefecture command∣ing this Countrey, is that of <HI>Wardhuyse,</HI> its Castle has its Name from the <HI>Island Warda</HI> wherein it stands, and is about Eight <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Miles from the main Land of <HI>Finmark,</HI> and near Twelve in Compass; the Food of the Inhabitants of this and the Neighbou∣ring <HI>Island</HI> is only <HI>Stock-Fish,</HI> which they dry in the Frost. No manner of Bread nor Drink have they, but what is Imported from Forreign Countreys; some Cattle they have, yet none but such as can live on dry'd Fish their Masters Diet. The Gover∣nor retires in the <HI>Winter</HI> more <HI>Southerly</HI> within the <HI>Land,</HI> by reason of the extre∣mity of the <HI>Cold,</HI> and the long absence of the <HI>Sun</HI> for some Months together, the Town lying within the <HI>Artick Circle.</HI> It is much improved of late, since the re∣moval of the <HI>English</HI> Trading from <HI>Novo∣grod</HI> to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> not far from hence, and is both profitable and useful to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> in regard of its strength, the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> being obliged to touch at it in their way to <HI>Moscovy.</HI></P>
<P>On the North of <HI>Norway</HI> lies <HI>Finmark,</HI> or
<PB N="111" REF="59"/>as the Natives call it, <HI>Taakemark,</HI> which is not divided as all other Countries gene∣rally are, into distinct Lordships and In∣heritances, but every Man pretends a Right and Title to every part of the Land, and the strength of the Arm is the only Judge of Controversies. when the Fish∣ing Season comes in they throng to the Sea Coasts, and when that is over retire again into the <HI>Laplands.</HI> Fixt habitations they have none, but remove their Dwel∣lings according to the Seasons for Hunt∣ing; their Houses are made only to secure them against the Injury of the Weather, and the assaults of wild Beasts; and for that purpose they first erect Four Posts in the Figure of a Square, which they bind together with cross Girders, and rear to them smaller pieces, fastning all with Wythes; these except the door places, the poorer sort wholly cover with boughs of Trees or such like stuff, the richer with a course sort of Woollen Cloth, or an ordi∣nary sort of Canvas. Two doors have they in these Houses, the fore door, which is of common use and entrance for the whole Family, and the back door, thro which the Men pass, and that only when they go a Hunting, Fishing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all Women are forbid it, either because that Sex is thought to be very inauspicious to those Exercises,
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>for if any (when he is a going a Hunting or the like,) do but meet a Woman, he presently returns back and leaves his de∣sign for that day; or because the Image of their God <HI>Thor</HI> was commonly placed near their back door, from whose Sacrifices and Presence all Women are wholly exclu∣ded. These Houses are distinguished into several Partitions, not by any Wall, but only by great Posts or Loggs of Wood laid upon the Ground; their Fire place is in the middle, about which the whole Fa∣mily lies, either upon the bare Earth or upon the Skins of Rein Deer, Bears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When they have a mind to change their Habitation, which they do constantly twice a Year, they unty this their Tent, take it away with them, and pitch it in a more convenient place. Another Sort of Houses among them, are their Granaries and Store Houses; which that they may the better secure their Provision from wild beasts and vermin, they do not build upon the Ground, but at some distance from it, upon the bole or stump of a large Tree.</P>
<P>The Ordinary Diet of the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> is either of Fish or the Flesh of their Rein Deer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which they eat sometimes raw, sometimes boil'd, but for the most part dried in the air. Bread and Salt are
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>unknown to them, instead of Bread they make use of their dry'd Fish, groun'd small like Meal: And for Salt they take the in∣ward of the Pine Trees, which they dry in the Sun, and putting it into Boxes bury it a small depth in the Ground, then after it hath lain there a competent time, they kindle a fire upon the place and so dry it; whereby it becomes of a redish co∣lour, a pleasant taste, and gives a good gust and relish to their courser Food.</P>
<P>Their general Drink is pure Water, which in the Winter time they keep in their Houses continually hot, and so drink it. Of late they are grown ac∣quainted with Brandy and Liquors of that nature, which are in great vogue with them, and which they drink only on their Holy Days and at their Weddings. Their Dining Room is commonly in the middle of their Tent about the Fire, with∣out Tables, Dishes, Spoons or Trenchers, and such sort of Implements; each lays his Commons upon his Mittens, and when he has eat it, says Grace, shakes his Camrades by the right Hand, which is their Charity Cup; and so every one trudges about his business.</P>
<P>Their Garments are very course and mean, made either of the Skins of Wild Beasts, (frequently in use amongst them)
<PB N="114" REF="61"/>or the worst of our <HI>English</HI> Cloth, which they wear only on Holy Days and at their Publick Fairs. They alter them accord∣ing to the Season of the Year; and each Sute for distinction sake, has a several Mode and Fashion: The Men use a Long Garment reaching down from their Mid∣dle to their Ankles, which serves them for Breeches and Stockings; above this they have a sort of Wollen Coat call'd Mudd, which they tye about them with a Leathern Thong. Their Shoes, as the the rest of their ordinary Garments, are made of the shins of rein Deer, Elks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the hair outward, the toe bending somewhat upward, and according to the ancient Custom, ending with a sharp point: On their Heads they have a Cap made of the Skin of some Fowl, as Geese, Ducks, or the like, but particularly make choice of the Loom for that purpose, and like the ancient <HI>Germans</HI> taking the Feathers, Head and Wings along vvith it. The Garb proper to Women is a large vvide Govvn, made either of Cloth or Skins, according to the Persons Condition and Estate: this Govvn is gathered close in the middle, and decked vvith several Figures of Birds, Beasts, and the like, vvhich they vvork very prettily and vvith great art.</P>
<P>As for their Religion, before the plant∣ing
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>of Christianity in that Countrey, which nevertheless has made but little progress among 'em, and would be entirely aban∣doned, were it not for the strictness of the Government; they had their Deities pub∣lick and common to the whole Nation, and others belonging onely to a Family, a Division, a Neighbourhood; their greater Gods were the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> their lesser was <HI>Wira Accha,</HI> represented by an old stump of a Tree: they also pay Adoration to the Ghosts of Men depart∣ed, especially of their Relations and Friends, whom they consider as Divinities; they worship also <HI>Spectres</HI> and <HI>Demons,</HI> which they fancy wander among the Rocks, Woods, Rivers and Lakes; they do the like to their <HI>Genius</HI>'s good or bad, whom they say fly in the air about <HI>Christ∣mass.</HI></P>
<P>Their Gods common to the whole Countrey be <HI>Thor</HI> or <HI>Thiermes,</HI> that is, <HI>Thunderer</HI> or <HI>Noise-maker,</HI> they honour him with endearing and lofty Titles, as, <HI>Great-Grand-Father</HI> and the like; they fancy his abode to be in the Clouds, and that he disposes of Wind, Rain, Thun∣der, good and bad Weather, as he thinks fitting: He it is they think gives Life or Death, Health or Sickness, Blessings or Sufferings: They make his Image of
<PB N="116" REF="62"/>Beech-Tree, easily turning the stoops which shoot out from the root into the likeness of a Mans Head, Arms, Feet, and the rest, laying by him a Bow, Arrows, and a Hammer to kill the mischievous <HI>Demons.</HI> They place their Images upon a Table in a piece of Ground dedicated to that Service, not far from their Habita∣tions, the Table serves them for an Al∣tar, and the Boughs of Birch and Pine for a Temple. They suffer not their Women to be present at the Sacrifices they offer to him, looking upon that as very Criminal. But they never offer Sacrifice till they have enquired of their God whether he will accept it or no: And this they do with a certain Instrument which they call <HI>Kannees,</HI> resembling much the old fashi∣oned Drums, on which they picture seve∣ral of their Gods: The whole manner of the Ceremony being as followeth, They pull off some of the hair at the bottom of the Beasts Neck which is to be sacrificed, and bind it to a Ring which is fastned to the Drum, then one of them beats the Drum, and all the rest sing these words, <HI>What sayest thou, O great and sacred god, doth thou accept this Sacrifice whic we de∣sign to offer unto thee?</HI> And while some Chant these Words, others repeat the Name of the Mountain where they are;
<PB N="117" REF="62"/>then if the Ring rests on that part of the Drum where the God is pictured, they take it for granted the God is pleased; and so proceed to the Ceremony; or else cary the Sacrifice to <HI>Storejunkar</HI> or some other God, using the like Form of words, <HI>Father god will you have my sacrifice?</HI> Their usual Sacrifices are Rein-Deers, Cats, Lambs and Hens. The usual time of their offering up their Sacrifices is in <HI>Autumn,</HI> because that Winter and Nights approach∣ing, they think they have the more need of their Gods assistance: Their way of Consecrating is in this manner, First they Sacrifice the Rein-Deer, then taking out his Bones they anoint the Idol with the Blood and Fat, and bury the Flesh and Bones under ground, but this they do not till the God has approved of the Sacrifice, after which they bind the Rein-Deer be∣hind the house, then with a sharp knife they run him thro the heart, and gather the heart blood, wherewith they anoint the I∣dol, into a Vessel. After that having placed the Images right, making a new one eve∣ry time they sacrifice, and setting them in order behind one another, the last al∣ways hindmost, they approach with reve∣rence to it, anoint the Head and Back all over with the blood, but on his Breast they only draw several crosses, behind him
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>they place the Skull, Feet and Horns of the sacrificed Deer; before him they place a Coffer made of the bark of Birch, into whic they put a bit of every Member of the <HI>Rein Deer,</HI> withsome of the <HI>Fat;</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Flesh</HI> they convert to their pri∣vate uses.</P>
<P>The next of their Principal <HI>Gods</HI> is <HI>Store∣junkar,</HI> that is, <HI>Great Commander,</HI> he they say presides peculiarly over all Beasts and Cattle; this Gods Name they reverence with the highest respect, and pay him fre∣quenter, if not greater Devotion than o∣ther Gods, for they suppose him to be their <HI>Thor</HI> or <HI>Thiermes</HI> Lieutenant, and worship him because that they think they receive all their <HI>Blessings</HI> thro his <HI>hands,</HI> and that all <HI>Beasts</HI> and <HI>Cattle</HI> are subject to his <HI>Will,</HI> and he governs <HI>them</HI> as <HI>Thiermes</HI> does <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Spirits;</HI> wherefore he can give them to whom he will, and none can re∣ceive them without his pleasure: Thus, <HI>Thiermes</HI> and <HI>Storejunkar</HI> are the two pe∣culiar <HI>Gods</HI> of the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> the one hav∣ing the <HI>Dominion</HI> over the <HI>Men,</HI> the other over <HI>Beasts;</HI> one bestows life, the other all things necessary for the sustenance of it. When they offer <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Storejunkar,</HI> which is likewise a <HI>Male Deer,</HI> they firstrun a <HI>Red Thred</HI> thro his <HI>Right Ear,</HI> and bind <HI>Him,</HI> and sacrifice <HI>Him</HI> in the place where
<PB N="611" REF="63"/>they did the like to <HI>Thor, preserving</HI> the <HI>blood</HI> also in a Vessel; then he who performs the Ceremony takes the <HI>Horns</HI> and the <HI>Bones</HI> of the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Neck,</HI> with the <HI>Feet</HI> and <HI>Hoofes,</HI> and caries them to the <HI>Moun∣tain</HI> of that <HI>Storejunkar,</HI> for whom the <HI>Sa∣crifice</HI> was designed: When he comes near the <HI>sacred stone</HI> he reverently uncovers his head and bowes his body, paying all the Ceremonies of Respect and Honour, then he anoints the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>Fat</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> and places the <HI>Horns</HI> behind it; un∣to the right <HI>Horn</HI> they fasten the <HI>Rein-Deers Yard,</HI> and to the left some red <HI>Thred</HI> wrought upon <HI>Tin</HI> with a little piece of <HI>Silver.</HI></P>
<P>The third and last of their Principal Gods is the <HI>Sun,</HI> whom they call <HI>Baiw,</HI> and worship him chiefly for his Light and Heat; also because they believe him to be the Author of Generation, and that all things are made by his means, especially their <HI>Rein-Deers,</HI> of whom and their Young, they think he hath a peculiar care to cherish by his Heat, and bring suddenly to Strength and Maturity. And being they live in a cold Country, where their heat is diminished and of∣ten wholly extinguish'd, being they have nothing to sustain themselves with but the flesh of <HI>Rein Deer;</HI> they think it very fit to pay the <HI>Sun</HI> very great Honours; who is the Author of so great Blessings to them, and who at his return restores them that Light which they lost by his departure, and that not for a day or two, but for several Weeks, which being paid, the new days seems
<PB N="120" REF="64"/>welcome to them, by reason of long absence. Now the Sacrifices they use to the <HI>Sun</HI> are young <HI>Rein Deers,</HI> and those not <HI>Bucks,</HI> but <HI>Does,</HI> the <HI>Rites</HI> being much the same with those before-mention∣ed, except only instead of a red String thro' the right Ear of <HI>Storejunkars Sacrifice,</HI> they run a white one thro the <HI>Suns;</HI> then they make a Garland, not of <HI>Birch</HI> but <HI>Willow,</HI> about as big as the Hoop of an Hogshead. This they place upon a Table be∣hind the Hut, where they Sacrifice to <HI>Thor;</HI> not upon the same Table, but one like it. And this Sa∣crifice differs from the <HI>Other,</HI> in that there are neither Images erected here, nor Horns, the <HI>Beasts</HI> not being come to their growth. But that there may be some rissemblance of the Sun, they place their chief Bones of the Sacrifice upon the Table in a Circle.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Laplanders</HI> are not more nototorious for their Idolatry than for their Witchcraft; anci∣ent and modern Writers asserting that they have attained to so great a skill in Enchantments and Magick, as that among several other strange Effects of their Art, they could stop Ships when under full Sail, nay and could either by their looks, words, or some other wicked Artifice, to ensnare and bewitch Men, as to deprive them of the use of Limbs and Reason, and very often bring them into extream peril of their lives. Now one of the main Reasons and Motives of their so doing, is, that every one thinks it the safest way to defend himself from the injurious and malicious designs of others; for they com∣monly profess that their knowledg in these things is absolutley necessary, for their own se∣curity. Wherefore they have Teachers, Pro∣fessors
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>in this Science; and Parents in their last Will bequeath to their Children as the greate part of their Estate, those Spirits and Devils that have been any ways serviceable to them in their life time. Now as to the bequeathing their Familiars to their Children, they consider it as the only means to raise their Family, so that they excel one another in this Art, according to the largeness of the Legacies they receive. By which it is apparent that every Family hath peculiar Spirits, and of different and quite contrary Na∣tures from those of others; and as each house, so has each single person his particular Spirits, sometimes one, two or more; but there are a set number of obsequious Spirits, beyond which none hath. Nevertheless some of these Spirits will not engage themselves without great Soli∣citation and earnest Entreaties, whereas others will readily offer themselves to little Children, when they find them capacitated for their turn, so that several of the Inhabitants are almost na∣turally Magicians; for when the Devil takes a liking to any person in his Infancy, as a fit In∣strument for his purposes, he presently seizes on him by a Disease, in which he haunts him with several Apparitions, from whence accord∣ing to the Capacity of his Years and Understand∣ing, he knows what belongs to the Art. Those who are thus taken a second time see more Vi∣sions, and gain far greater knowledge. If they are seized a third time, which is seldom with∣out great torment or utmost danger of their life, the Devil appears to them in all his shapes, by which they arrive to the very Perfection of his Art, and become so knowing, that without a
<PB N="122" REF="65"/>Drum they can see things at greatest Distances, and are so possessed by the Devil, that they see them even against their will. And a certain <HI>Swedish</HI> Author tells a strange Story of a <HI>Laplan∣der,</HI> who upon complaint made against him for keeping a Drum, brought it, and delivered it up to him, and with Tears confest, that tho he thus willingly parted with it, and never intended to provide another, yet he should still be tor∣mented with the same fearful and troublesome Visions about future Events, which (tho' his Eyes were shut) were always present to his im∣agination, giving him a true and particular Re∣lation of whatever had happened to him in his Journey to <HI>Lapland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Art it self, it is according to the di∣versity of Instruments used in it, divided into two parts, one comprehends all that to which the Drum belongs; the other, those things to which Knots, Darts, Spells, Conjurations, and the like refer: The Drum is peculiar to the <HI>Lap∣landers,</HI> and called by them <HI>Kannus</HI> or <HI>Quochdas,</HI> made of a hollow piece of Wood, and must be either of Pine, Fir, or Birch Tree, which grows to such a particular place, and turns directly according to the Suns Course; which is when the Grain of the Wood running from the bottom to the top of the Tree; winds it self from the right hand to the left. It is made hollow on one side, upon which they stretch a Skin, fasten∣ing it with wooden Pegs; on the other they make two holes to hold it by; the shape of the upper part is Oval, about half an Ell in Diameter; upon the Skin they paint several Pictures in red, stain'd with the Bark of an Alder∣tree; and through the middle they draw
<PB N="123" REF="65"/>some cross Lines in every Quarter, of which they place their Attendants; neither do they alwaies observe the same Gods, and the same Methods. But this is obser∣vable, that they commonly paint the Sun in the middle, their Gods above, and the earthly things under him. And since Chri∣stianity was introduced among them, many of them do place upon their Drum the Image of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his Apostles, owning him to be, or to have the power of one of their Gods. Moreover, they alter their figures according to the occasion of the inquiry, retaining the general Notions the Heathens had of their Deity, that several of them had peculiar Offices and Employ∣ments. But now, though in many places they have been forced to abandon their Drums, yet do they practice all their knots, have their familiars in the shape of Flies, Bees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But chiefly their black Cats (whom they not only Consult at home about their Domestick affairs, but take with them also in their huntings; tho in the depths of Snow;) and their Diaboli∣cal Exercises, which are performed some∣times with, sometimes without a Drum: If with a Drum, the Sorcerer kreels down, and having a bunch of Rings, and other pieces of Brass laid in the middle of
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>the Drum, he beats with a Consecrated Hammer, so strongly, that the Rings dance upon it, by the resting of which upon such a figure, they draw forth an answer to what they would desire to know; but if this be not satisfactory, then the Drummer puts himself by dancing and howling into a vio∣lent motion, till he falls down, which he chuses to do upon his Drum; and then he lies without motion and disturbance, and without sense, till he voluntarily rise again, and gives answer to what is desired. This kind of Divination is chiefly used, when something at a great distance is desired to be known. The Stories are so frequent, and from persons not over credulous, that there is no room left to doubt of what they say concerning these Sorceries. A∣mongst other Instances thereof, this is rela∣ted by a Person of worth and understand∣ing; who being one time at Dinner with his Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his Fathers knife was missing upon the sudden, and could not be found, till two years after a Counsin of his returning from being Fa∣ctor in, or near <HI>Lapland,</HI> brought it with him, telling them, that out of curiosity he had employed a <HI>Laplander,</HI> a pretender to great skill in this Art, to bring him notice of the health and condition of that Family;
<PB N="125" REF="66"/>who after he had lain sometime in this now described manner, brought him news, that they were all well, that he found them at Dinner; and that to confirm his Rela∣tion, he brought away that knife, which he delivered to the Merchant, and the Mer∣chant brought home now to his Uncle.</P>
<P>As I said before, they sometimes pra∣ctice these Sorceries without the Drum, using instead of it commonly Strings or Darts, by which they advantage their friends, or injure their enemies at their pleasure. The strings they make use of to raise or quell the Winds, which they sell to Mariners for that purpose. They con∣sist commonly of three knots; the first of which being untied, affords a favourable Wind; the second a brisk Gale; and the third a violent Storm; as has been approved to the great peril &amp; loss of several Seafaring persons, that have given account of it in pub∣lick. By their Darts, which are short Cylin∣ders of Lead; they wound any one who hath done them an injury, or their malice puts them upon to assault: These are said to be the most powerful Charms of any, &amp; upon occasion to have split Rocks, level'd Moun∣tains, and such like incredible Exploits.</P>
<P>They have Matrimony in great venera∣tion, it being seldom known they commit
<PB N="126" REF="67"/>Adultery, but if such a crime be once dis∣covered, it is severely punished. Now, when ever any man purposes to marry, his first business is, to make inquiry after a Maid well stock'd with <HI>Rain-Deers;</HI> for the <HI>Lap∣landers</HI> have a Custom of bestowing upon their Children soon after their Birth, some certain number of those <HI>Rain Deers,</HI> and their Encrease is accounted of not as the Parents Estate, but the Child's Portion. Thus she, who has the greatest number of them, is in the fairest way to have a Hus∣band. Nor have they regard to any thing else, not minding either good Breed∣ing or Beauty, or other the common al∣lurements of Wooers. Now the Spark ha∣ving pitched upon a Mistress, informs one of his nearest friends of his Intentions, and desires him to be his Spokes-man: This Kinsman of his sollicits the business with her Father, Mother, and Kindred, present∣ing and cajoling them with Brandy and Tobacco, or what else is most in request in order to the purchasing their Consent. After this the Suitor has an Invitation to the Hut where the Bride dwells, where he agrees to certain Articles offered by her friends, and then lists himself for a whole year in her Fathers service; though first
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>presenting the Father with a Silver Cup, &amp; Kettle of either Copper or Alchimy, and a Bed, or at least handsom Bedding. To the Mother he gives a Girdle of Silver, a Robe of Honour, and a Whisk, which they wear about their neck, and let it hang down to their breast, interlaced all about with Bosses of Silver. Besides, he bestows upon the Brothers and Sisters, and all the Kindred, Silver Spoons, Silver Bosses, and some other such knick knacks of Silver; for each of them must be presented with some gifts by the Bridegroom, if he mean to obtain his Bride. But the time of his years Service being expired, he takes to him his Wife, and proceeds to the Solem∣nizing the Marriage, which is ever per∣formed with great Pomp and Ceremony, according to their abilities. The Bride is spruc'd up with the Choicest Ornaments they can get, as pieces of Tin and Alchi∣my, with several Rings of Fish Bones and Brass; though a Bride of the Richer sort first looses her hair, and the Fillet where∣with she bound it up together before, she gives to the Virgin that is next akin to her: Afterwards on her bare head and loose hair she puts a kind of Silver Fillet, guilt over, or two, such as is the womens Custom to wear at other times, instead
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>of a Garland or Coronet, which is practised in <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and other Northern Countrys, so that by how much this Fillet is looser then to environ only her head; so much it hangs down the more behind. Like∣wise about the middle they put on a Silver Girdle, the Bridegroom too is as spruice as possible he can be, having the best cloaths on he can get at his own charges, and those girded with a Silver Girdle. Thus adorn'd is the Bride dragg'd to Church, or to the Priest, seeming to go with much reluctance, and there is married according to the usual Forms. In former times Matrimony was solemnized by the Parents and Friends (the Father supplying the place of the Priest, by striking of Flint and Steel, the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>test Emblem, as they thought, of a mar∣ried life; for as the Flint conceals within it Fire, which by concussion breaks forth; so in both Sexes there is life hid, which by the mutual coupling of Marriage, is propa∣gated at last to be a living Off-spring. Poligamy is not allowed of among them, a man being suffered to have but one Wife at a time. Nor do they contract Wed∣lock without the consent of their friends, to whom they refer themselves wholly as to that matter. Thus a stoln Wedding is never heard of among them, neither
<PB N="129" REF="68"/>are they suffered to trade for themselves, until they have served as Bondsmen their Father-in-law for a certain time, which Custom does seem to be derived from the most Primitive Times and Nations.</P>
<P>Pestilential Distempers are very rarely known in this Country, the pureness of the Air still correcting the malignity of them, when they happen to be introdu∣ced. Plurisies, Inflammations, and Soreness of the Eyes, they are sometimes troubled with, which last they cure by drinking a Decoction of the Root of <HI>Moss,</HI> or the Stalk of <HI>Angelica,</HI> in the Whey of the Milk of their <HI>Rain-Deer.</HI> They cure wounds with no other Ointments or Plaister than that of Rosin, which the Trees sweat out: If a Member be benummed with cold, the the Cheese made of <HI>Rain-Deers</HI> Milk, af∣fords the presentest Remedy to it; they thrust a red hot Iron into it, and with the Fat of the Cheese that instantly disti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from it, they anoint the part affected, with incredible success; and when troubled with any Pains or Aches in their Joynts, or Body, as the Gout; Cramp, Sciatica, or the like, they ease and cure them by ap∣plying a Caustick of the flame of any Chips to the affected place. Diseases be∣ing thus rare among them, and the Reme∣dies
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>so easie, they live to an extream old Age: many being known to live to above a hundred years old, and most usually at∣tain to Seventy, Eighty, and Ninety years, &amp; at this Age are still sufficiently brisk and lively, able to manage their business with expedition, to take a Journey, to Course through Woods and Mountains, and per∣form other such toil and labour, with great vigour; seldom do they grow grey, and that not till the very last declension of their Age; and it is found, that more of them are dispatched by old Age, than Dis∣eases.</P>
<P>But when they perceive any one near Death, they send either for the Priest, if near at hand, to prepare him for his Dis∣solution, or else for a Magician, who is said to be able to resolve them by his Drums, of the very hour and manner of any mans Death. In case he dies, they fancy his Soul is restless till his Body be buried, which for that reason they do with all possible hast, commonly carrying him to the nearest Wood or Cave which they pitch upon for a burying-place, sel∣dom interring them in Church-yards, by reason of their remoteness. The dead Corps they carry upon a Sledge, the person who conducts being particularly intreated
<PB N="131" REF="69"/>to undertake the Employment, and must receive of the nearest kinsman of the De∣ceased Person a Ring of <HI>Alchimy,</HI> and wear it fastened to his Right Arm; the reason of which is, because they believe it a pre∣servative against the mischief the <HI>Manes</HI> of the Deceased Person may bring upon them and therefore is fain to wear this same Ring till the Burial be over. When they come with the Body to the Cave, they cast it in, and the Sledge after it, or else cover it with great Logs of Wood, to de∣fend it from wild Beasts, never failing to lay by it a Hatchet, a Flint and Steel, that if ever they come to rise again in the dark∣ness, they shall have great need of spring¦ing a light; to which the Flint &amp; Steel may help them; as likewise there will be occa∣sion for a ready way wherein they may travel to Heaven, to which purpose their Hatchet may stand them instead, them especially that are buried in thick Woods, that if any Trees obstruct their passage, they may cut them down. When they come home from the burial, they make ready a Funeral-banquet, or rather indeed a Sacrifice to the Ghost of the Deceased Person, which they perform, by taking those <HI>Rain-Deer,</HI> who drew the Corps to the Grave, and offer them in Sacrifice to
<PB N="132" REF="70"/>the <HI>Manes,</HI> revelling upon the flesh with Brandy and Tobacco, and quaffing round a Health to the Deceased Person, calling the Brandy which they use for that pur∣pose the <HI>Wine of the Blessed,</HI> meaning that they drink it to the memory of him, that is happy by his departure from Earth. At this Feast they take special care not to lose the Bones of the sacrificed <HI>Rain-Deer,</HI> but gather them all up diligently, and lay them in a Coffer, and bury them under ground; but first fasten upon the Coffer wherein they shut up the <HI>Rain-Deers</HI> Bones, the Image of a Man fashioned out of Wood, bigger or less in proportion to the Deceased Person.</P>
<P>But the Scepter of <HI>Denmark</HI> extending over but a small part of <HI>Lapland,</HI> it is not necessary to inlarge upon the other To∣picks, which the Description of that Coun∣try does afford; wherefore we will leave it, and steer our Course towards.</P>

<HEAD>The Islands of <HI>Fero.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Islands of <HI>Fero</HI> are only many high Rocks and Mountains covered with thin Earth, of about two foot deep, and divided from each other by rapid streams of deep water: Part of them are inhabited, and part stocked with Cattle;
<PB N="133" REF="70"/>the Account whereof, with their Havens, Creeks, Inlets, and other Circumstances, take as followeth.</P>
<P>They are Seventeen in number; <HI>Fugloe,</HI> or <HI>Fowle-Island,</HI> about two <HI>English</HI> Miles in breadth, and three in length. 2. <HI>Swino,</HI> in which is a pleasant Valley of a mile is length. 3. <HI>Vederoe,</HI> six Miles long, and three broad. 4. <HI>Bordoe,</HI> six Miles in length 5. <HI>Kunoe</HI> is a long and narrow Island, much of the same bigness as <HI>Bordoe.</HI> 6. <HI>Kalsoe</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seven Miles long, &amp; near two Miles broad, 7. <HI>Osteroe</HI> is almost twenty Miles in length, but unequal in breadth; for some places are two miles broad, others four or six Miles broad, according as the points stretch themselves far out. 8. <HI>Fromoe</HI> twenty four Miles long, and eight broad, being the largest of the <HI>Feroe</HI> Islands, and contains the Town of <HI>Thorshaven,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> and place of greatest Trade of them all▪ 9. <HI>Wagoe,</HI> a round piece of ground of a∣bout eight miles in Diameter. 19. <HI>Mig∣geness,</HI> three miles long, and one and a had broad, having a high Territory, with high Promontories round about it, there being but one place to come on Land. 11. <HI>Kol∣ter,</HI> a small Island, a Mile in length, and half a Mile in breadth. Betwixt twenty and thir∣ty years ago, there was found on the
<PB N="134" REF="71"/>highest top of the Mountain of <HI>Kolter,</HI> the quantity of many Tonnes of Herrings spread along; the Mountain where the Herrings were found is above two hun∣dred fathoms high, being carried thither by a Whirl-wind. 12. <HI>Sandoe</HI> eight Miles long, and four Miles broad. 13. <HI>Skuo</HI> three Miles long, and one broad. 14. <HI>Forcdie∣men,</HI> or <HI>Great Dam,</HI> is almost round, being a good Mile in Diameter, with a high Territory, for the most part flat and green, above with great Clefis round about. 13. <HI>Lille-Diemen,</HI> a small Island, whereon feed a vast number of wild Sheep▪ 16. <HI>Suderoi,</HI> twenty Miles long, and eight broad, having a very good little harbour <HI>fiord,</HI> having a bowed Creek, where there is one of the best. Havens in <HI>Fero,</HI> called called <HI>Punthaven.</HI> And lastly, 17. <HI>Vaages-Lebroc.</HI> Besides, four little Isles, or <HI>Holmes,</HI> namely, <HI>Tintholm, Muggenesholm, Troleho∣fred,</HI> and <HI>Lilly-Diemen,</HI> which afford only Pasture for wild Sheep, with several other smaller Holms, whereof the most neces∣sary to be known by Mariners are <HI>Hof∣frigsholm, Kirckbockholm,</HI> and <HI>Combocholm.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of these Islands is temperate in all seasons, not over-hot in Summer, nor so violent cold in Winter, as to cause Ice in any of the Bays, and withal wholsom, and
<PB N="135" REF="71"/>free from all Contagious Diseases▪ unless introduced by Strangers; so that the In∣habitants generally attain to a very long life: Yet the Scurvey, the Leprosie, and a sort of Feverish Distemper, by the In∣habitants called <HI>Landsarforo,</HI> are Epidemi∣cal Diseases, which reign in most of these Islands, but rarely prove mortal. Besides, the Inhabitants are exceedingly subject to Rheums, which occasion Coughs and Head-achs, which they nevertheless cure by drinking some Whey, as hot as they can bear it. Thunder they never hear in Summer, but often in Winter, Spring and Autumn, and that too attended with vio∣lent Storms.</P>
<P>The Fertility of these Islands is not over great, they affording hardly any other grain than Barley, whereof, never∣theless a Tun of Seed will commonly yield twenty or thirty Tun of grain. But their Pasture-grounds abound in good and sweet Grass, and those stockt with as large and fat Oxen, as shall be seen in any other part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>These Islands do likewise abound in all sorts of Medicinal herbs, as Scurvey-grass, Water-cresses, Sorrel, <HI>angelica;</HI> as also <HI>Radix Rhodia,</HI> which is no where met with in such abundance, as upon the
<PB N="136" REF="72"/>Banks of Running Streams and Lakes in these Islands. Thus they want nothing re∣quisie for the cure of such Distempers as the Natives are most subject to.</P>
<P>Great plenty, and variety of Fowl is here to be found, as doves, Stares, Owls, Sparrow-Hawks, Crows, Grillins, and Ravens, as well white, as others. The Sea-Fowl with them in most request is a kind of Teal, about the bigness of a Crow, with a long, round, and yellow Bill. The Eyder (a sort of Duck, which yields the Eyder Down) is a Bird pecu∣liar to these Islands, and which usually pulls the Down from her own Breast to make her Nest withal. When her young one are fledg'd and fled, the Natives take away the Down, and change it for use. But if the Feathers be pull'd off by man, they rot away forthwith, and are of no use. Another remarkable Fowl they have by them, called <HI>Imbrim,</HI> with a long Neck and Beak, the Back grey, and chequer'd with white spots, with a white Ring about the Neck: This Bird has two holes under her Wings, each large enough to hold an Egg; here 'tis thought she hatches two Eggs at once, being never seen with above two young ones at a time, nor known to come ashore.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="72"/>
The neighbouring Seas do provide the Natives with God, Whiting, large Floun∣ders, Marts a kind of Pilchards, of which such store, that the Havens and Creeks are filled with them, besides, Seals, Grind Whales, Morsses, and Dogfish, though their fishing Trade is much decayed of late years to what it was formerly.</P>
<P>These Islands were first inhabited by <HI>Norwegians</HI> about the year 840. and so the <HI>Norwegian</HI> tongue was for a long while generally spoke, though of late years the <HI>Danish</HI> Dialect has much prevailed.</P>
<P>The people are humble and civil to one another, and especially Courteous to Stran∣gers; Loyal, and liberal in their Contribu∣tions to the Government, and Charitable to the Poor: they are moderate and fru∣gal in their Dyet, which is chiefly on Milk, Fish, Gruel, and Flesh. They dry both their Flesh and Fish in the Wind, having Wind houses for that purpose, when the flesh is dryed, they boyl it in Water, and thicken the Broth with Barley Meal; which is reckon'd one of their greatest Delicacies.</P>
<P>As for their Apparel, the Men wear woollen shirts, flannel Trowces, and Wast∣coats, with short loose Coats of the same. The Women rich and poor, go all alike, in strait Growns without skirts. Their
<PB N="138" REF="73"/>Stomachers are commonly large, and a∣dorn'd with thin gingling guilt plates of Tin. Their Shoes have no soles, but have pieces of leather drawn together at the Heels and Toes, and fastned with a string, or ribband about the Ancle, and are of Sheep-skin for the Women, and tann'd Neats leather for the Men. They lie on Beds of Hay, overspread with pieces of flannel.</P>
<P>These People were first Converted to Christianity in the year 1000. by <HI>Sigismoad Bristyon,</HI> a Native of <HI>Fero,</HI> who was sent by the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> into his own Country for that purpose, Immediately after the <HI>Augsbourg</HI> Confession was recei∣ved in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> it was estab∣lished in <HI>Fero,</HI> these Islands containing at this day thirty nine Parishes, which are all officiated by Ministers of the Lutheran Religion. Besides <HI>Sundays,</HI> Holy-days, and the usual days of Prayer, as in other pla∣ces, they annually observe six peculiar days of Prayer, three in <HI>Ascension</HI> week, and three in <HI>Michaelmas</HI> week. They have one publick School endowed by King <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> the 4. and <HI>Nichilas Trolls,</HI> Vice-Ad∣miral of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Government of these Islands, it is divided into the six Districts of <HI>Nor∣deroe,
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>Ostaroe, Stromoe, Waaegoe, Sandoe,</HI> and <HI>Sanorce.</HI> Each of these Districts has a Sheriff, who sits as Judge, and determines all Causes and Controversies of less mo∣ment. The Laws of <HI>Norway</HI> are the <HI>Laws</HI> of these Islands. They having none pecu∣liar of their own.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical affairs are governed by a Synod of the Priests and Ministers, who meet and fit once a year. Out of the whole Synod one is Elected to preside o∣ver the rest, with the title of Provost.</P>
<P>The Principal Commodities these Islands afford, are Skins, Feathers, Tallow, Train∣oyl, and Stockings; upon all which there is a particular price set. Stockins are the chief staple Commodity they have, in the making of which, all the Inhabitants of all Conditions are constrained to employ them∣selves for the getting a lively-hood, which the smallness of their Incomes, their slender possessions, and inconsiderable sti∣pends, would hardly otherwise afford.</P>
<P>As for the Isle of <HI>Schetland,</HI> which many will have to be the Ancient <HI>Thule,</HI> it lies about sixty Degrees, &amp; a few odd Minutes of Northern latitude, and has nothing very observable, the manners of its Inhabitants, the natuae of its Soyl, the temperature of its Air <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being much the same as in <HI>Iseland.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="region">
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>
<HEAD>Of Iseland.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Iseland</HI> is an Isle in the <HI>Deucalidonian</HI> Seas, scituate under the <HI>Artick</HI> Circle, at 13 Degrees, and 30 min. of longitude, and 65 deg. and 44 min. of latitude; being bounded on the East with the <HI>Northern</HI> O∣cean; on the <HI>South</HI> with the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Sea; on the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> with the frozen Sea of <HI>Greeland.</HI></P>
<P>The Discovery of this Island was first made by one <HI>Naddoc;</HI> who sayling near the Coasts of the <HI>Fero</HI> Islands, was by a storm forc'd upon the <HI>Northern</HI> parts of this Island, which by reason of the abundance of Snow, wherewith the Country was then covered, he called <HI>Sneeland.</HI> After that, it was a second time discovered by a <HI>Sweedish</HI> Marriner called <HI>Gardar,</HI> who called it <HI>Gar∣darsholm,</HI> after his own name, and finally discovered by one <HI>Flocco</HI> a <HI>Norwegian</HI> Py∣rate, who called it <HI>Iseland,</HI> from the vast quantities of Ice in it, and about it; being frozen continually for the space of eight months, and so vehemently chilled with the <HI>Northern</HI> winds, that it yieldeth neither Corn nor Trees, except Juniper only.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="74"/>
<HI>Ingulph</HI> a <HI>Norwegian</HI> Baron, is said to have brought the first Inhabitants into this Island, in the year 874. though there is reason to believe it was peopled before that time, &amp; known too, by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> it being acknowledged, that the Ancient <HI>Iselan∣ders,</HI> called the <HI>Irish Papey,</HI> and the <HI>Western</HI> part of their Isle, as most frequented by <HI>Irish</HI> Merchants <HI>Papey.</HI> Besides, there is still several remains and monuments of Idolatry in this Island, which show its ancient Inha∣bitants to have been Pagans, whereas the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians</HI> at the time of their first setling there were Christians.</P>
<P>The modern Natives are for the most part plain and simple, living on what is gi∣ven them by nature, without the help of Art, more then that of making Cheese and Butter: the Mountains serving them for Towns, and the Rivers for Drink, and they quarter with their Horses and their Oxen under one and the same roof. As they do not stand in need of either Physick or Phy∣sician, so neither do they use any, their temperance in meat and drink, and the na∣turally strong constitution of their Bodies enabling many of them to attain to the age of 150 years, and more, Nay, <HI>Olaus Magnus</HI> affirms they commonly live to the age of three hundred years, and <HI>Blykenius</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>reports, that he saw a man in <HI>Iseland,</HI> who told him that he had then lived two hund∣red years.</P>
<P>Their habitations are for the most part of timber, roofed with slags or turfs, with a hole on the side of the roof to let in their light; though in their Cities of <HI>Hola</HI> and <HI>Shalholt,</HI> instead of Tiles, they make use of fir-boards. But in their Hurts scatter'd up and down the Country, the <HI>Iselanders</HI> and their Cattle have the same lodging for the poorer sort of the Inhabitants, being desti∣tute of Wood and Turf, and not able to pur∣chase fuel from abroad, are forced in the extremity of Winter to betake themselves to a corner of their Ox-stalls, and there borrow warmth from their Cattle.</P>
<P>The food of the <HI>Iselanders</HI> is upon Beef, Mutton, and the like, with most sorts of Foul, which they have in great abundance, the truth is, they have no variety of Sau∣ces, but the sharpness of the air furnisheth them with stomachs which need none. Fish they have great plenty of, and which dried, is indeed their only bread, and their Ling is so excellent, that even with us it is counted one of our greatest Dainties.</P>
<P>Their most common Drink is Whey, which is generally so good, that an ounce of it will very well bear half an Ounce of
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>Water. They have also a sort of Mead, made of Barley flower, and a Honey-comb boyled in Water, and another liquor squee∣zed out of a certain reddish Berry, pecu∣liar to this Isle. But though they have neither Ale, Bear, nor Wine, they can make a shift to be sumptuous, nay, profuse in their Revels and Banquets, for we read that <HI>Theodore,</HI> and <HI>Thorwald</HI> (Brethren and Citizens of <HI>Hialtedat</HI> in <HI>North Iseland</HI>) so∣lemnizing the Funerals of their Father <HI>Hialta,</HI> entertained twelve hundred Per∣sons for fourteen days together at a Ban∣quer; and at the departure of his Guests made 'em all presents, every one suitable to his quality; many more instances have they of the same kind.</P>
<P>They have little mony in <HI>Iseland,</HI> what they have is <HI>Danish,</HI> but that in very small quantity; bartering one Commodity for another, being their method of buying and selling, as it was of all other Nations in the Non-age of Commerce.</P>
<P>The principal Commodities of this Coun∣try are Whalebone, which they have in such abundance, that many of 'em make Houses of it, and the only Bridge in the Island is framed of the same matter, they also formerly exported vast quantities of Beef, Mutton, Butter and the like, and do
<PB N="144" REF="76"/>still, dryed Fish, and Brimstone, the great Veins whereof do feed and nourish the flames of Mount <HI>Heela,</HI> which is one of the greatest <HI>Vulcanoes</HI> in the Universe, it belches forth by fits such inundations of fire, as menace the whole Isle with a gene∣ral conflagration, vomiting not only flame &amp; fiery Coals, but large torrents of water, which burn like Brandy, or <HI>Aqua-vitae.</HI> At other times it casts forth stupendious quantities of Cinders and pumice stones, insomuch that it darkneth the Sun. The <HI>West</HI> wind occasions its greatest outrages; so that when the wind blows moderately from that quarter, the People of the adja∣cent Plains, knowing the safest passages to the Mountain, crow'd up to the mouth of the furnace, where they find their Diver∣sion by throwing great stones into the flames, which return them with as great violence as a barrel of Gunpowder blows up the slates of a House. Whereby a man runs great danger in approaching the flames who is not perfectly acquainted with eve∣ry part of the mountain, for he not only runs the risque of being knocked on the head with some of those stones which fre∣quently comes to pass, but also the ground does surprizingly open, and the flames swallow up men alive. Of this and two
<PB N="145" REF="76"/>other Mountains in this Island called <HI>Helga</HI> and <HI>la Croix,</HI> more strange circumstances are related, than what are said of <HI>Aetna,</HI> many of the silly superstitious Inhabitants believing that underneath it is Hell, and the abode of the damned, &amp; some do confidently report that they have frequently seen whole Herds of Devils throng into the mouth of the furnace with their Burthens of damn'd Souls, and having eas'd their shoulders, re∣turn for a new leading. Nay, they will con∣fidently pretend to know the very day that any Battle is fought in any part of the world, by observing the more than usual importation of Souls on such days. Ano∣ther place of Torments the Natives do i∣magine to be under the Rocks on the Sea Coasts, and the clashing of the Ice against the shoar, and banks, makes such a noise, as they take for the howling of the damn'd. There is also said to be a Foun∣tain in <HI>Iseland,</HI> which petrefies immediate∣ly whatever is thrown into it; so that if a man takes a long pole, and stick part of it into the bottom of the lake, that part of the staff which sticks in the Earth, will pre∣sently be turned into Iron, the middle into Stone, and the uppermost part remain Wood, which came not into the water, the same Authors write of another lake there
<PB N="146" REF="77"/>which sends forth such pestiferous exhala∣tions, as poyson the Birds which flie that way.</P>
<P>The modern language of <HI>Iseland,</HI> is the true old <HI>Danish</HI> Tongue, used in ancient inscriptions, and other monuments of <HI>Ru∣nick</HI> learning, which has been preserved Chast and pure to this day in <HI>Iseland,</HI> by reason of the little Commerce they have had with other Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Iseland</HI> was formerly divided into four Provinces, called <HI>East, West, North,</HI> and <HI>South Iseland,</HI> from the four quarters of the World: Each of these Provinces was subdivided into three lesser Districts, except North <HI>Iseland,</HI> being larger, into four. E∣very Districk had in it three publick Courts of Judicature, and ten or more <HI>Ʋreppar,</HI> or Constable Wards, the Govern∣ment of the Isle was <HI>Aristocratical</HI> till the year 1260. when being brought under the Crown of <HI>Norway,</HI> it since followed the fortunes of it in all Changes of Church and State made subiect with it to the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> together with it reformed in matters of Religion according to the Con∣fession at <HI>Augsbourg,</HI> retaining still their Bi∣shops with a limited power, and turning the Revenues of their eight Religious Houses of <HI>Pingore, Remestede, Modur,</HI> and <HI>Monke∣nire,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="77"/>under the Government and jurisdicti∣ion of the Bishop of <HI>Halar;</HI> and those of <HI>Videy, Pernebar, Kirckebar,</HI> and <HI>Skiade,</HI> un∣der the Bishop of <HI>Schalholt</HI> unto other u∣ses, according to the will and pleasure of their Lords of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>But their Gods in the time of their Pa∣ganism, were, 1. <HI>Thor,</HI> who is said to have come out of <HI>Asia,</HI> with his Father <HI>Woden,</HI> and is answerable to <HI>Jupiter</HI> among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and gave name to our <HI>Thursday,</HI> in <HI>Iseland</HI> called <HI>Thorsday,</HI> and by the <HI>Ger∣mans Donderdag,</HI> that is, <HI>the Thunderers day,</HI> which signifies the same thing. 2. <HI>Wo∣den,</HI> or <HI>Oden;</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Asians,</HI> who first peopled these <HI>Northern</HI> Coun∣treys. From him the <HI>Iselanders</HI> call the fourth day of the week <HI>Odens dagur,</HI> and we <HI>Wednesday.</HI> Besides these two, we sometimes read of <HI>Freyer,</HI> one of <HI>Wodens</HI> Companions, and <HI>Friga, Wodens</HI> Spouse (whence our <HI>Fryday</HI> with several others of less note.) They have but two Cities, and those no better than our Ordinary Vil∣lages, yet the Seats of their two Bishops, the first is <HI>Hogin,</HI> the second is <HI>Shalholt,</HI> their other places of any note are <HI>Hatten∣fort,</HI> a Haven Town, where under ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants barter their Com∣modities, and beside a Castle, the ordinary
<PB N="148" REF="78"/>Residence of the Governor for the Kings of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Court of Judicature, it is held once a year in a pleasant Plain in the middle of <HI>Iseland,</HI> where twelve men lear∣ned in the Laws of <HI>Iseland,</HI> having heard all the <HI>Plaintiffs</HI> and <HI>Defendants</HI> have to say, pronounce sentence, and decide the Controversies. And have power to deter∣mine all Civil Causes, and pronounce Con∣demnation as they think convenient against all Criminals. Such as receive sentence of Death, as Adulterers, Murderers, and Notorious Thieves, are beheaded; less Misdemeanors and Offences are marked in the Fore-head with an hot Iron.</P>

<P><HI>FReezland</HI> so called from the continual frosts unto which it is subject, lies South-west of <HI>Iseland</HI> in 60 degrees, more <HI>Westerly</HI> than any part of <HI>Europe;</HI> it is said to be little less in extent than <HI>England;</HI> being a ragged and high sand, its mountains covered with Snow, and the Coast so full of drift Ice, that it is almost inaccessible. The longest day in Summer not exceeding
<PB N="149" REF="78"/>20 hours; nevertheless the Soil is so cold and barren, that it produceth neither Corn nor fruit, Fish being the principal, and al∣most only Food of the Inhabitants, and as it is their Food, so it is the chief Commo∣dity the Country does afford, there being good fishing every where upon the Coast. It was first discovered to us by <HI>Nicolas</HI> and <HI>Antonio Zani,</HI> two <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen that were here Shipwrackt. Our Sea∣men in their soundings brought up a sort of Pale Coral, and little stones clear as Chry∣stal. They called it <HI>West-England,</HI> and one of the highest Mountains <HI>Charing Cross.</HI> The chief Town is called <HI>Friezland</HI> by the name of the Island; situate on the <HI>East∣ern</HI> shore of it. Besides we find some o∣thers in the Maps as <HI>Sanestol, Ocebar, Caba∣ra, Sorand,</HI> and some more very inconside∣rable. And now let us proceed on to <HI>Green∣land.</HI></P>

The length of it is not known, nor whether it be an Island or a Continent, being chiefly frequented for the benefit of the Whale fishing. The chief commo∣dities are Fish, white Bears, wild Deer, and some store of Cattel there bred. The greatest part of the people dwell in Caves, and delight to a high degree in Necroman∣cy Other Lands there be, but not of any note, nor hardly worth the Claiming of the Crown of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
