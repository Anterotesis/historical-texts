<HEAD>A BRIEF DISCOURSE OF The most assured means and methods to ruine and pull down the vast Monarchy of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Written by a judicious Person, who for above twenty years resided at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> being there employed by a great Prince as his Ambassador.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Turkish Empire</HI> is vulgarly called, the <HI>Empire</HI> of the <HI>Otto∣mans,</HI> from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Otho∣man</HI> the first Emperour of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ottoman</HI> the first <HI>Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of the Family now reigning, most of whose Successors did severally en∣large their Dominions, and
<PB N="2" REF="4"/> by their Conquests added thereto, some of them entire <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> and the rest, great and rich <HI>Provinces.</HI> Whereby they have made themselves <HI>Sovereign Lords</HI> of part of <HI>Europe,</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> and many great portions of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior's</HI> Empire borders upon the <HI>Republick of Venice</HI> towards <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> and that of <HI>Raguza,</HI> situate upon the shoar of the <HI>Adriatick Sea.</HI> This latter <HI>Republick</HI> is their Tributary, and can preserve it self no longer than it shall please the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> for besides that the City is not strong of it self, its situation is very disadvantageous, being built at the foot of a great <HI>Mountain,</HI> from whose top they may by rolling down of huge stones overwhelm them, and soon become their absolute <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Masters.</HI> Within a quarter of a league of <HI>Raguza,</HI> there is a <HI>Port,</HI> or <HI>Harbor,</HI> named <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> of a wonderfull capacity, wherein a numerous fleet may winter with much safety.</P>
<P>If the prudence and policy of this <HI>Prince</HI> were as great as his power and strength, he might long sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e have over∣come this <HI>Republick,</HI> and have made use of the said <HI>Harbor</HI> for forty or fifty of his <HI>Gal∣lies</HI> to lie always in a readiness there, by
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> which means scarce a Ship could go out or into the <HI>Adriatick Sea</HI> without being taken.</P>
<P>The whole Coast of <HI>Puglia</HI> might very easily be ruined by the descents they might make, the distance from <HI>Raguza</HI> to <HI>Puglia</HI> being so little, that one may easily see from one shoar to the other.</P>
<P>Also the <HI>Republick of Venice,</HI> though great by <HI>Sea,</HI> and who get most of their riches by Trade and Navigation, must soon have declined, and could not but under the favour and protection of a pow∣erfull Fleet have sent any forces to de∣fend several of their Islands and places of importance; as <HI>Corfu, Zant</HI> and <HI>Cepha∣lonia.</HI></P>
<P>They are Neighbours to <HI>Zara,</HI> a City lying in <HI>Dalmatia: Zara</HI> is on the <HI>Adri∣atick Sea-coast</HI> very far up within the <HI>Gulf</HI> towards <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> near to <HI>Friuli</HI> and a Fort called <HI>Palma,</HI> which the <HI>Venetians</HI> erected several years since, to hinder their frequent incursions.</P>
<P>They are likewise Neighbours to the <HI>Arch-Duke</HI> of <HI>Grats,</HI> a <HI>Prince</HI> of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Bohe∣mia.</HI> They are <HI>Sovereigns</HI> of the greatest part of the Upper and Lower <HI>Hungary,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of many Cities not far from <HI>Vien∣na,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> gained by force of Arms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Valachia, Bogdania</HI> and <HI>Transilvania</HI> are their Tributaries, whom they change whenever they please: <HI>Bog∣dania</HI> joyns to <HI>Poland</HI> on one part.</P>
<P>If we take our survey along the coast of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> on the <HI>European</HI> side nigh <HI>Caffa,</HI> they confine upon the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Tartary.</HI> This Nation they make use of as the <HI>French</HI> Kings do of the <HI>Swiss.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> which washes <HI>Asia,</HI> they border upon the Coun∣try of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Maingrelia,</HI> and are also Neighbours to the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Georgia,</HI> both the one and the other are their Tri∣butaries. <HI>Georgia</HI> lies near the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> with whom he confines; as likewise does the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> in many places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> are frequently in debate, and at war, as well by reason of their Vicinity which creates frequent occasions of quarrel, as out of the emula∣tion and jealousie each <HI>Prince</HI> hath of his own grandeur; besides the contrariety in <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> calling the <HI>Persians</HI> Hereticks, and the <HI>Persians</HI> esteeming them so too, and yet both of them hold <HI>Mahomet</HI> for a <HI>Prophet</HI> and the <HI>Messenger of God,</HI> not differing in their Belief, but
<PB N="5" REF="5"/> in Ceremonies, and the washings they are to observe when they prepare them∣selves for their Devotions.</P>
<P>In <HI>Egypt</HI> along the <HI>Nile</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> con∣fines with <HI>Prester-John,</HI> and is <HI>Lord</HI> also of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> of <HI>Meccha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> places of their greatest Devotions; <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> being born at <HI>Meccha,</HI> and buried at <HI>Medina;</HI> these Cities are near the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> he likewise possesses a great deal on the <HI>Mediterranean Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Along the coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> he hath the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>Tripoly, Barbary, Tunis</HI> and <HI>Algier,</HI> and joyns upon the countries of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Marocco,</HI> who pay him homage and subsist in their dominions only be∣cause they are of the same belief with him. I shall not speak here of the great number of <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> which are under his com∣mand, nor of the innumerable <HI>Provinces</HI> he holds, my design being only to repre∣sent in few words the grandeur of this <HI>Empire,</HI> and the ways to overthrow it.</P>
<P>If we survey what he holds in <HI>Europe,</HI> and also compute from <HI>Raguza</HI> or <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI> a City upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> to <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> hardly can a horseman travelling ten or twelve leagues a day, ride from one end to the other in three months time, and in all that vast extent of Land,
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> there is no other <HI>Prince</HI> that hath any territory or command, he being the abso∣lute <HI>Lord</HI> of all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ottoman Princes</HI> are wont so soon as they make themselves Masters of any <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Province</HI> to observe one me∣thod, which is to seize on all the <HI>Demesns</HI> of the <HI>Vanquish'd Prince,</HI> all that belongs to the <HI>Church,</HI> or to those that die in battel, or those who by flight make a shift to escape the storm.</P>
<P>As for those People who are content to remain in subjection to their <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> they leave to all such the posses∣sion of their <HI>Estates,</HI> and the exercise of their <HI>Religion,</HI> establishing according to the extent and riches or strength of the Countrey so conquered, either <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> or <HI>Governors</HI> of such <HI>Provinces,</HI> together with <HI>Judges</HI> to administer <HI>Justice.</HI> These Estates thus taken are shared amongst a certain number of Souldiers sufficient to guard and preserve their Conquests; they likewise bestow fomewhat upon their <HI>Ecclesiasticks,</HI> but no more than is neces∣sary for their feeding and cloathing.</P>
<P>We must observe that the <HI>Grand Seig∣nior</HI> hath three sorts of Treasu∣ries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">First.</NOTE> The first is managed by the <HI>Treasurers</HI> of his <HI>Port,</HI> who
<PB N="7" REF="6"/> are three in number, to whom all others within the Dominions of his <HI>Empire</HI> ought to give an account of their administrati∣on; the expences of those <HI>Provinces</HI> where they are employed being deducted, they send the surplus of the revenue to the said <HI>Treasurers</HI> of the <HI>Port,</HI> who pay off the Souldiery every three months, as well as all other the expences of the <HI>Grand Seignior's</HI> household, or whatever else belongs to the <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Go∣vernmont;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second.</NOTE> the overplus (which makes another Treasury) is left under the keeping of an <HI>Eunuch</HI> whom they call <HI>Asenadar Baschy,</HI> and is one of the three principal <HI>Eunuchs</HI> who are near the person of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> and who never stir out of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> or <HI>Palace,</HI> unless to attend and follow their <HI>Master.</HI> The sums of Moneys which are put into the custody of this <HI>Eunuch,</HI> re∣main in Cash still and are never employ∣ed unless the most urgent affairs require it, and then oftentimes the <HI>Treasurers</HI> of the <HI>Port</HI> are fain to oblige themselves to make it up again with moneys from a∣broad.</P>
<P>The third Treasury, is that of the <HI>Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third.</NOTE> which is very great for the following reasons:
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> The <HI>Turkish Empire,</HI> as I have said be∣fore, is wonderfully large; the devotion of that people is great; it is true they have not amongst them either <HI>Bishopricks</HI> or <HI>Abbeys,</HI> they have onely very sump∣tuous <HI>Temples</HI> which serve them for <HI>Pa∣rishes.</HI> The <HI>Ottoman Emperors,</HI> their <HI>Pa∣shaws,</HI> their principal <HI>Officers,</HI> and an in∣finite number of other devout people, have founded and given much of their wealth to these <HI>Temples,</HI> (which we will from henceforward call <HI>Parishes</HI>) which are worth an hundred or six score thou∣sand Crowns yearly revenue; those that serve in them are few in number, and their allowance so moderate, that they must make hard shift to live thereon, so that there is much money remaining, which is put into the treasury of the <HI>Church,</HI> whereof the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> is the principal <HI>Guardian:</HI> yet cannot he make use of it, but when urgent occasions of State, and the maintenance of their Faith makes it necessary, unless he will offend his Conscience, and violate the Laws of the <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<P>The Revenues of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> are very vast, arising as well from the or∣dinary duties paid by the common people, as those contingent sums that are brought
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> into his <HI>Coffers:</HI> he is heir to all his Soul∣diers and to every one that receives pay from him, if they die without Children; but if they leave Daughters he takes but two thirds of the inheritance and successi∣on of the deceased, holding the place of Son.</P>
<P>As there comes frequent complaints against such as are in eminent Offices and employments of trust, that they may have pretence to fleece them and get their Estates, they soon conclude them guilty, and seize upon all they have to apply it to the use and benefit of the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> This injustice and cruelty is of dangerous consequence; as is that likewise of appropriating the revenues of their <HI>Temples</HI> to their own private advantage.</P>
<P>To resume what I was saying of the methods they pursue when they have conquer'd any <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Province;</HI> after they have given to their <HI>Temples,</HI> and to those that serve in them what they think to be necessary, and also to such numbers of Souldiers designed for the guard of their new Conquests, they apply one part of it to the maintenance of the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> or <HI>Governor:</HI> they do the same for <HI>Sala∣ries</HI> to the <HI>Judges,</HI> and other <HI>Officers,</HI> all which is distributed by the <HI>Treasurer</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="8"/> the <HI>Province,</HI> who is accountable for the same, and who ought every three months to bring the remainder into the <HI>Grand Seignior's Coffers,</HI> upon pein of corporal punishment and confiscation of his Goods.</P>
<P>Speaking of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Thunis,</HI> I had forgot to mention with what facility the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> might infest, yea ruine the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and by the fre∣quent cruisings of his <HI>Galleys</HI> molest the coasts of <HI>Calabria,</HI> since hard by <HI>Thunis</HI> there is a <HI>Gulf</HI> which beats at the feet of the ruines of <HI>Goletta</HI> and the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Car∣thage,</HI> able at all seasons to contain a na∣val force: Near the said <HI>Gulf</HI> there is a very safe and a very capacious <HI>Harbor,</HI> named <HI>Porto Farino,</HI> distant from the said <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Sicilia</HI> not above fourscore miles, and therefore may be sailed over in a very short time. Should the <HI>Turk,</HI> powerfull as he is, keep always a good number of <HI>Galleys</HI> in readiness in the afore∣said <HI>Gulf</HI> of <HI>Thunis,</HI> or the above-named <HI>Porto Farino,</HI> they might soon be upon the <HI>Sicilian</HI> shoar, keep them in perpetu∣al alarms, which would ruine the trade of all such as sail upon the coast; hinder the <HI>Sardinians</HI> in their traffick, whilst the <HI>Islands</HI> of <HI>Malta, Corsica, Majorca,</HI> and <HI>Minorca,</HI> would be liable to the same trou∣ble and inconveniencies.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<P>But the ambition of the <HI>Ottoman Prin∣ces,</HI> and the inveterate hatred they bear against the <HI>Persians,</HI> having cut them out so much work on that side, they have neglected the opportunities they had to doe these and other mischiefs to the <HI>Eu∣ropean Princes;</HI> besides that their <HI>Religion</HI> obliges them to believe that there is more merit in killing one <HI>Persian Heretick</HI> in war, than if they slew threescore and ten <HI>Christians,</HI> so that their great zeal and rage carries them more that way. And this is that which hath in some measure secured the <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> which ne∣vertheless hath but too many times felt the weight and force of this too potent <HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1593. the Treaties of <HI>Peace</HI> made between the <HI>Emperour Rodulphus</HI> and the <HI>Grand Seignior Amurath,</HI> about the interest of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> (wherein both of them had shares) were broken, and they fell out, and that Agree∣ment was converted into a dangerous and bloody war; the event proved pre∣judicial to <HI>Christendom,</HI> and shamefull to the said <HI>Emperour,</HI> by the signal loss of a <HI>Battel,</HI> the <HI>City, Castle</HI> and <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Agria;</HI> it was terrible and bloody for the vast numbers of Christians slain upon the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> place, or taken and carried away captive by the common enemies of our Faith: It was in <HI>Anno</HI> 1596 that this disaster hapned.</P>
<P>We must observe that this War com∣menced during the reign of <HI>Amurath,</HI> and ended in the reign of <HI>Mahomet</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> who had the reputation and honour of being at the head of his Army when this Victory was gained; but he did not make use of all that advantage which for∣tune had put into his hands; for instead of wintering and putting part of his Army into the Cities under his command, which are numerous on that frontier, he retur∣ned to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and lost the oppor∣tunity of making himself assuredly <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and of all <HI>Hungary;</HI> which gave the <HI>Emperour</HI> leisure and means to prevent his utter ruine.</P>
<P>In those times the interest of the <HI>Po∣landers</HI> made them begin to bestir themselves, and they were making ready to joyn their forces with the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s, foreseeing and apprehending that after the loss and ruine of <HI>Hungary,</HI> they must needs fall too; yet, notwithstanding this their fears of the power of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> their neighbour, and some other ob∣stacles mentioned elsewhere then obstruct∣ed their design.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<P>Before I propose the certain means whereby the <HI>Christian Princes</HI> may ruine this great <HI>Monarchy,</HI> I shall speak some∣what of its dreadfull force and strength, that so such as shall take the pains to reade this brief Discourse may know, what great power they have, and what forces they can bring together to trouble and molest <HI>Europe,</HI> and by consequence what care ought to be taken to hinder the dismal effects. Now we ought not to let them know their own advantages any longer, but prevent and attaque them betimes, which cannot be without a <HI>Ge∣neral union of the Christian forces:</HI> but be∣fore I discover the methods they ought to take, it will be necessary, (as I said above) to represent what the power of the <HI>Turk</HI> is, as well by <HI>Sea</HI> as by <HI>Land,</HI> that it may be apparent they are not easie to be beaten, or overcome, but by the way prescribed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Empire</HI> hath under its command five and forty <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> as well in <HI>Europe,</HI> as <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> the names and titles of them in the <HI>Turkish</HI> tongue are not un∣derstood by the <HI>European Christians,</HI> (un∣less by such as live under their subjection) which is the reason why I shall not par∣ticularly nominate them, but refer my
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> self to the capitulations between our <HI>Kings</HI> and the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> (which were not long since translated and ampli∣fied) under the reigns of <HI>Amurath, Ma∣homet,</HI> &amp;c. who had so much vanity, that in order to make known their grandeur and power they caused them all to be named and inserted in those agreements.</P>
<P>There are in this number of five and forty <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> two of them that have each his five and twenty <HI>Provinces</HI> under his command, and in every <HI>Province</HI> they have a <HI>Governour</HI> whom they entitle <HI>San∣jacbey,</HI> as much as to say <HI>Lord of the Stan∣dard,</HI> or <HI>Banner,</HI> nay some of them, whom I shall only name, as the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> hath seven and twenty <HI>Provin∣ces;</HI> the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> eighteen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Natolia</HI> seventeen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Arzeron</HI> seventeen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> twenty four, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Baseras</HI> twenty one, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Diar∣bekir</HI> nineteen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> more than the above named; but not to be too tedious, I shall omit to mention the rest.</P>
<P>The Forces of all these <HI>Provinces</HI> as well of Foot as Horsemen, without in∣cluding those that ought to serve at Sea, are very formidable: the number of
<PB N="15" REF="10"/> them is above eight hundred thousand men, 'tis true they are not so brave and generous as they have formerly been, by reason of the <HI>Venality</HI> that hath crept in amongst them.</P>
<P>During the reign of <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> (a covetous <HI>Prince</HI>) he began to receive great Presents from those to whom he gave considerable Commands; this autho∣rized the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s to doe the like on their parts, which disorder does still continue if not increase amongst them, so that e∣very thing is sold to any person that bids highest, even to the meanest and most servile employments. Now we must consider that those that have them may not hold them above a year or two, and having dearly bought the short liv'd pur∣chase, they lay most intolerable burthens upon the people to re-imburse them∣selves.</P>
<P>The beginning of this disorder is attri∣buted to <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> who tenderly loving his Sisters and Daughters, instead of marrying them, according to the cu∣stome of other <HI>Emperours</HI> his Predecessors, to the <HI>Governors</HI> of <HI>Provinces</HI> far distant from his <HI>Port,</HI> would needs bestow them on his <HI>Bassa</HI>'s residing near him, that he might the oftner and more conveniently
<PB N="16" REF="11"/> see them. The expences of these <HI>Pri∣cesses</HI> being very great, being entertained within the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Emperour</HI> their own <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Brother,</HI> and their Hus∣bands not having sufficient Estates to de∣fray the charges, they began underhand to take bribes either in <HI>Money</HI> or <HI>Jewels</HI> of such whom they recommended or hel∣ped to Offices and Commands, being well assured the interest of their Wives would save their Heads in case they should happen to be discovered and accused: these failures have been followed by ma∣ny others of no less importance.</P>
<P>I said, in the beginning of this Dis∣course, that as the <HI>Ottoman Emperours</HI> went on with their Conquests, they settled in every <HI>Province</HI> a certain num∣ber of Souldiers, as well foot as horse to guard and defend the Countrey; as also to make use of elsewhere upon any case of necessity that might happen to the <HI>Empire.</HI> As for their <HI>Horsemen,</HI> whom they call <HI>Timars Espahi,</HI> excepting only five and twenty, or thirty thousand who attend constantly at the <HI>Grand Seignior's Port,</HI> and some others who are quarter'd at <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and at <HI>Damascus,</HI> who are paid every three months in rea∣dy money at so much a day, some more,
<PB N="17" REF="11"/> some less than the others, their pay being encreased according to the merit of their Service: all the rest are <HI>Timariots,</HI> whom we shall henceforward call<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Estates settled upon condition of furnishing certain num∣bers of armed Men and Hor∣ses for Service.</NOTE> <HI>Commandry's,</HI> and accord∣ingly as their <HI>Commandry's</HI> are in value, those that en∣joy them are obliged to ap∣pear in the Field, with a cer∣tain number of men well ar∣med and mounted, or else to remain at home to guard and defend the Countrey, as they shall be appointed.</P>
<P>When these <HI>Commandry's</HI> were first established, the revenues of them were not so great as they are at present, for as their <HI>Empire</HI> hath encreased, so these are likewise augmented so much, that there are some of them worth ten or twelve thousand Crowns a year: the <HI>Bassas,</HI> the <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> the <HI>Mutes,</HI> the <HI>Dwarfs,</HI> and even those <HI>Women</HI> the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> makes use of, have an exact ac∣count of the names of all the best of them in each <HI>Province,</HI> (as we have of <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Parishes</HI> in this <HI>Kingdom</HI>) and when ever any vacancy falls, they beg them, and put in some <HI>Domestick</HI> Servant or Slave of their own, that they may

During the tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that I served the <HI>King</HI> as his <HI>Ambassado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> at the <HI>Grand Seignior's Port,</HI> I have obser∣ved such great and frequent changes that I cannot imagine where his <HI>Highnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> could find even amongst his slaves an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one that would accept of, or adventur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="21" REF="13"/> to be raised to the highest dignity of his <HI>Empire;</HI> that <HI>Prince</HI> observing no other rule of <HI>Justice</HI> to put a <HI>Bassa</HI> to death, or any other <HI>Officer,</HI> but an ill opinion or suspicion of their infidelity, and some disorder he fansied in his affairs; which jealousies are most commonly suggested to him by the whisperings of some pri∣vate enemy.</P>
<P>All the form of Justice observed in put∣ting such persons to death, as have been raised to the supremest dignities of the <HI>Empire,</HI> is, that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> makes a demand in writing of the <HI>High Priest</HI> of their <HI>Law,</HI> whom they call <HI>Mufty,</HI> what punishment that slave or subject deserves who commits felony against his <HI>Prince</HI> and his <HI>Empire,</HI> enumerating all the rea∣sons of his suspicions and discontents, which he puts down for truths. Now as the question presupposes the certainty of the fact, the <HI>Mufty</HI> ever concludes it to be death, and thus without any form of process the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> sends them away to be strangled, they having onely a very short time allowed them to say their prayers. Immediately after the <HI>Justice</HI> appears, who takes an <HI>Inventory</HI> of the dead man's goods, as guilty of high <HI>Treason,</HI> and all the silver and household-stuff,
<PB N="22" REF="14"/> horses or jewels, are applied to the benefit of the <HI>Imperial Treasury;</HI> as are likewise the remainders of his Estate, ex∣cepting only what the party should have enjoy'd during his life, by his <HI>Princes</HI> consent, which goes to his Children, and afterwards to his Childrens Children, and in default of such to the <HI>Church:</HI> and this is all the remedy they can find to se∣cure somewhat to their posterity. In my time the late <HI>Sultan Amurath</HI> satisfied himself with their spoils, and did not put them to death: his Son <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> was more cruel; for he never deprived any one of his dignity, without taking away his life at the same time. This ty∣rannical custome pleases the common peo∣ple, who delight in blood, and applaud the <HI>Prince</HI> for such his proceedings; how∣ever the consequence is dangerous; for those that have the great and eminent Commands, and find themselves ever in danger of their lives, would easily be tempted to take part with others, if oc∣casion presented, besides that most of those who are raised to the supremest dig∣nity are tribute children.</P>
<P>Since I have begun to make mention of the disorders that are in their <HI>Govern∣ment,</HI> I shall here take notice of one no
<PB N="23" REF="14"/> less considerable than the above named. Most part of their Souldiery, and especi∣ally the body of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who are about the number of forty thousand men, his Light-horse called <HI>Spahis-Oglan-ler,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re likewise composed of five and twenty thousand, whom they call <HI>Legionaries;</HI> these ought to be, according to ancient custome, Tribute-children, and are de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igned to serve the <HI>Prince</HI> in war. The <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of his <HI>Chamber,</HI> who are named <HI>Montaferagas,</HI> the Servants whom they call <HI>Chechenigirler,</HI> those that have the keeping and care of all their Arms, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey name <HI>Gebegiler,</HI> the <HI>Gunners</HI> called <HI>Toupchiler,</HI> and a world of other Officers of his household, who exceed the number of forty thousand, ought likewise to be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same sort. But since the corruption of money and the custome of bribery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd buying and selling of places is grown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o rise in this <HI>Empire,</HI> and particular per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons have rather studied their own inte∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est than the service of their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>State</HI> is sick and in danger of falling: These levies are made every fifth year, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the tribute of the people, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough all the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and generally in every Countrey under their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommand, by <HI>Commissaries</HI> deputed for
<PB N="24" REF="15"/> that purpose out of the Body of the a∣foresaid <HI>Janizaries.</HI> Now, whereas in a Village containing a hundred or six score <HI>Fires,</HI> or more or a less number of <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> there may be found, perhaps eight or ten <HI>Turks</HI> inhabiting amongst them, whose Children being bred and conver∣sing daily with the others of the like Age do learn their Language and Customs, the Fathers willing their Children should be chosen and taken by the <HI>Commissaries,</HI> in∣stead of those of the <HI>Christians</HI> which are to be raised as tribute, give them up glad∣ly, in hopes they may hereafter attain to honour and greatness: (for by these ways it is they come to be made <HI>Bassas,</HI> to com∣mand Armies, and to marry the Sisters or Daughters of their <HI>Prince</HI>) and therefore often give a good piece of Money to those <HI>Commissaries,</HI> and give their Infant <HI>Turk,</HI> some Christian name to make it pass the better; and thus are they often admitted and brought to the <HI>Grand Seignior's Port,</HI> as Tribute Children, where they are carefully bred in certain places allotted for that purpose, whence they canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> go forth, being guarded by <HI>Eunuchs</HI> (as their Wives also are) they have Tutors who teach them their Belief, their Laws▪ their Customs, and especially the Obedi¦ence
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> they ought to pay to their Superi∣ours, with other exercises according to their several inclinations. They abide here seven years thus shut up, that they may be thoroughly instructed; such as are found to be judicious, and have a soul inclined to vertue and goodness, the chief Overseer, (who is always an <HI>Eunuch</HI>) gives an account of them to the <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain</HI> of the <HI>Grand Seignior's Palace,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣med <HI>Capi Aga,</HI> to make his report; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thus they are brought nearer to his per∣son, and educated with more care. The <HI>Turkish</HI> Children who are admitted, and pass for the Sons of <HI>Christians,</HI> although very young when they leave their Pa∣rents, yet when they grow up to be Men, and are entred into the <HI>Grand Seignior's</HI> Militia, or placed in some other conditi∣on, remembring their Fathers and Mo∣thers, their blood and the place of their nativity invites them to return thither to see them.

<P>I may truly say, that in my time du∣ring the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> I have seen the <HI>Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Spahies</HI> in a body, march into the <HI>Grand Seignior's Palace,</HI> force him to give them audience in publick, and after they had made known their com∣plaints concerning the ill Governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and mismanagement of affairs, have obli¦ged him in their presence to take off th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heads of his most intimate <HI>Favorites,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Authors</HI> of all their <HI>Grievances.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Empire</HI> will be able for a long time without a miracle to resist both by Sea and Land the forces that shall con∣spire its ruine, unless they be such as I have computed they ought to be in the following part of this Discourse.</P>
<P>For besides the great numbers of the <HI>Militia,</HI> who live under their command, and who are in pay, as well in times of Peace as War, all others able to bear Arms are obliged to oppose the enemies of their Faith to the last drop of their blood; but when it is upon account on∣ly of an offensive war, or design of far∣ther conquest, then only those are obli∣ged to march that are under pay, they call that general obligation, <HI>Nefirham.</HI> There is no Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor in any other part of the world within our know∣ledge, that hath better conveniencies to make himself strong at Sea, than this same; he is <HI>Lord</HI> of the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> beyond <HI>Trebizond,</HI> the Countrey thereabouts be∣ing wonderfully populous, and wealthy, and infinite Forests, the Villages and Pa∣rishes being obliged some to cut down the Woods for the building of <HI>Gallies,</HI> others to saw and hew it, besides people appointed to make Nails, Ropes, Sails; then have they <HI>Ship-wrights</HI> that com∣pleat
<PB N="28" REF="17"/> them, together with all other the several workmen requisite, and in num∣bers sufficient, and all this without dis∣bursing one penny. These people are bound to perform the said duties when∣ever it is required, upon which conside∣ration they are exempted from the pay∣ment of any taxes or imposts, and their Children from being taken up as Tribute by the <HI>Commissaries,</HI> delegated for that purpose; thus a <HI>Galley,</HI> which amongst us would cost to build eight or ten thousand Crowns, does not stand the <HI>Grand Seig∣nior</HI> in above one or two thousand: as for the Cannon such Galley is to be fur∣nish'd with, there are infinite numbers made at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there being seve∣ral spacious places filled with them, they having all the necessary materials in their own Countrey for the compleating of them. As for the men that sail and row these <HI>Galleys,</HI> the natural <HI>Turks</HI> pay no taxes, but only when they are to send out Fleets to Sea, then they are to con∣tribute as much as the <HI>Christians;</HI> this duty is called <HI>Avaris,</HI> or <HI>Avania,</HI> and is raised, as I said, indifferently upon all that are under the power of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> in the same manner as they do the Pioneers in <HI>France;</HI> that is, that every
<PB N="29" REF="17"/> Parish (according to the quantity of Fires there are in each of them) ought to furnish one, two or three men, and the <HI>Judges</HI> are bound, at the discretion of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> to bring him the quantity of men to which their circuit is liable, or else five and thirty Crowns, in lieu of each man, as he pleases, who ac∣cording to the number he intends to set forth, either calls for the men, or sends for the money: To this end he makes use of <HI>Turks,</HI> not of <HI>Christians,</HI> for his greater security. By this method in less than two months time, he can have enough to Man out two or three hundred <HI>Galleys;</HI> their <HI>Mariners</HI> are not of the best, although there be great numbers in constant pay for that use and service, but to help them in case of necessity they take the Sea-men out of their other Ships, though they have no great skill in managing of <HI>Gal∣leys,</HI> their navigation being very different. That which makes them the more secure is, that they seldom go to Sea but in the Summer time, whilst the season is calm, and little subject to storms and the mis∣fortunes of winds and waves, otherwise they would often run the hazard of be∣ing lost, for want of sufficient knowledge in maritime affairs.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>
<P>As for the Souldiers they put on board their Galleys, there are some that have <HI>Commandries</HI> along the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Shore, chiefly towards the <HI>Morea;</HI> who send out one <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> one <HI>Lieutenant</HI> and other Officers, with fifty, three-score, or an hundred <HI>Jani∣zaries</HI> for each <HI>Galley,</HI> according to the undertaking they have in hand: the <HI>Ma∣riners</HI> are named <HI>Azabistan;</HI> they are well furnished with Cannon and want not for Ammunitions, but generally their Gun∣ners are unskilfull; and indeed that Art is very difficult, unless they have been used to Navigation, there being a great deal of skill in pointing of Guns upon the Sea, because of the motion of the Vessels and Galleys, which are ever in agitation more or less. As for their Pro∣visions they have them in great quanti∣ties, their Countries abounding much in Wheat, Rice, Flesh, Butter, Oil, Cheese, and other provisions necessary for Navi∣gation: they can endure a great deal, and that without any trouble, for from their infancy are they accustomed to live soberly. Their Galleys are not pe∣stered nor encumbred like ours: for first they have not the use of Wine, they carry no great store of Salt-meats, as we
<PB N="31" REF="18"/> do, besides many other things; wherefore their Galleys are much lighter than ours, cleaner, and the Rowers put to less labour and pains in their work, by reason the very Souldiers take a pleasure in helping of them; thus are they more fit and nim∣ble either to follow or to fly away from an enemy if they be over-matched.</P>
<P>In the Harbor or Port of <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> a great number of Galleys are ordi∣narily to be seen riding in the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> as we see our Horses tyed in rows within our Stables. Whenever the <HI>Grand Seig∣nior</HI> resolves to have a force at Sea, he can in less than two years time set out three hundred Galleys.</P>
<P>As for round Vessels, or as we call them, tall Ships, they have but few fit to make men of war: they have only five or six great Gallions which serve to carry Wood into <HI>Egypt</HI> proper for build∣ing, which they fetch from the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and from <HI>Egypt</HI> they bring back provisions to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as well for the use of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Kitchin as for the inhabitants: <HI>viz.</HI> great quantities of <HI>Rice, Sugars, Spices</HI> and other Victuals and Merchandize: of these <HI>Gallions</HI> they make some use in case of need. There may be found also about some forty or
<PB N="32" REF="19"/> fifty sail of <HI>Merchant</HI> Ships, which being well fitted may serve as a Convoy to the rest of the Fleet. They can likewise equip five or six <HI>Mahones</HI> (which are a sort of <HI>Galeasses</HI>) but they have but few men fit to manage them; they have some <HI>Christian Subjects</HI> whom they keep in the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Rhodes</HI> in a great Town na∣med <HI>Lindo,</HI> who have large and good Vessels, they can bring about twenty of these into service: and this is all the strength they can make at Sea, which is not very considerable, if the power of <HI>Christendom</HI> would joyn together to at∣tack them: And indeed, it is by Sea, that they may with most ease and cer∣tainty be destroyed, and not by Land, where they march with millions of men into the field: it being most true, that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> can make up two or three Armies, that shall each consist of at least two hundred and fifty thou∣sand men, as well foot as horse, but much stronger in horse than foot. Did they understand the art of War so well as we do, they would be invincible, since they have so much strength and courage. They carry along with their Armies a great number of small brass Field-pieces, which require not above
<PB N="33" REF="19"/> two horses to draw each of them; of these they have many, and so soon as they encamp they chain them to one another, and make a large ring, wherein they place a part of their Infantry, and there secure the Tents of their Chiefs.</P>
<P>That which makes them so valiant is their opinion and belief of <HI>Predestination,</HI> and their holding that all those that die in battel for the defence of their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Countrey</HI> die <HI>Martyrs</HI> and go into <HI>Pa∣radise,</HI> without any obligation of giving farther account or satisfaction for their former transgressions: on the contrary, such as die with their backs towards the enemy, flying from the shock, are all damned, and if they do escape the dan∣ger they lose their honour and the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s pay, and oftentimes their <HI>Com∣manders</HI> put them to death, at least their goods and estates are sure to be confiscate. They are ill armed, the foot who are quite naked carrying only a small Mus∣quet, and a very short Sword, which the greater part seldom know how to use, so that although they are very nu∣merous, if they be roundly charged, they are easily overcome, whatever resistance they strive to make. Their Cavalry are better, being advantageously mounted
<PB N="34" REF="20"/> upon very good horses; they go on to fight with much heat and fury, but will not stand any long engagement, unless they gain some apparent advantage; and if they make a retreat, it is by turning now and then back, and making a slight charge at every facing upon the enemy, which is their way.</P>
<P>And although I have in this Discourse made known the power of this great Ad∣versary, yet I dare warrant, would <HI>God</HI> permit an <HI>union</HI> of the forces belonging to the <HI>Christian Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates,</HI> that they would be more than sufficient to destroy them in a few years. But, as I have already hinted, they must first be attacked by Sea, and the Land forces ought by all means to avoid giving battel till they have the news of a naval victory, which will be inevitable, if <HI>God</HI> for our sins should not hinder and obstruct the effect of our joynt endeavours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Catholick King</HI> might arm an hun∣dred <HI>Galleys,</HI> as well such as he keeps upon the coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> as those of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicilia,</HI> compre∣hending that Squadron he maintains at <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Republick</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> (assisted by <HI>France</HI> with Men and Provisions) might
<PB N="35" REF="20"/> very well furnish two hundred <HI>Galleys</HI> with all the equipage necessary for their navigation; they may likewise furnish six <HI>Galeasses,</HI> which may well be called <HI>Mountains</HI> of the Sea, for they are won∣derfull great Vessels, and yet are rowed like <HI>Galleys,</HI> and carry a great number of <HI>Guns,</HI> some of them fit for battery. It is observed, that when the battel of <HI>Le∣panto</HI> was fought against the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Galeasses</HI> belonging to the <HI>Republick</HI> of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> which were there, and had their Ar∣my on board them, procured that Victory.</P>
<P>Besides these numbers of <HI>Galleys,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> can send eight or ten; <HI>France</HI> hath commonly twelve or fifteen, and could upon such an occasion set out fifty at least, if not more; <HI>Savoy</HI> five or six; <HI>Tus∣cany</HI> ten or a dozen; <HI>Genoa</HI> eight or ten; and <HI>Malta</HI> six. All these together would make up three hundred and fourscore <HI>Galleys,</HI> and six <HI>Galeasses.</HI></P>
<P>I would afterwards joyn to this force, which is very great, and might easily master and command the whole <HI>Mediter∣ranean-Sea,</HI> a hundred or two hundred of the largest and stoutest Ships that sail upon the Ocean. The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the most powerfull of any at Sea, might if he pleased, wonderfully help towards
<PB N="36" REF="21"/> this enterprize; the <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> might give a great addition, being so renowned through all the world; the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> in his Countries and coast of <HI>Bretagne, Guienne, Normandy</HI> and <HI>Provence</HI> might forward this design, there being no <HI>Prince</HI> in all <HI>Europe</HI> that hath more <HI>Pilots</HI> and <HI>Mariners</HI> than his <HI>Maje∣sty,</HI> who alone is able to furnish more Seamen than any of the <HI>Princes</HI> in <HI>Europe;</HI> their number is so great, that for want of employment in their own Countrey, they go abroad and serve in foreign <HI>Gal∣leys</HI> and Ships of <HI>War:</HI> so that his <HI>Majesty</HI> may greatly contribute to this pious War. The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> has likewise some very good and brave men of War; each of these great <HI>Monarchs</HI> setting a helping hand to this work, they are able together to put out a Fleet of above two hundred stout <HI>Ships,</HI> and <HI>Gallions.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Fleet</HI> would be much more usefull and considerable than that of the <HI>Galleys,</HI> and serve to many more purposes, that is, to fight, to carry recruits, and what∣ever refreshments shall be necessary where they are wanting, either to the <HI>Galleys</HI> or elsewhere: they might also have great numbers of Souldiers that might be landed on the enemies Countrey in convenient
<PB N="37" REF="21"/> places, and also trains of Artillery where∣with to besiege Forts and Castles that ought to be attacked: they can carry Arms to furnish such poor <HI>Christians</HI> (slaves to the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>) who would be willing to revolt in favour of our Army.</P>
<P>If this Union and force at Sea thus projected could be brought to pass, it could never be destroy'd but by the anger of the divine power in some most prodi∣gious storms at Sea. There ought to be a place appointed where all the <HI>Galleys</HI> and <HI>Ships</HI> might have their general ren∣dezvous to meet in a Body. At <HI>Malta</HI> there are very capacious and safe Harbors, but that is a barren <HI>Island,</HI> where they have not Corn enough to feed their <HI>Knights</HI> and their own Inhabitants, their provisions being brought thither from <HI>Sicilia.</HI></P>

<PB N="38" REF="22"/> Saint Mary,</HI> neighbour to <HI>Castel-novo,</HI> the first Maritime City belonging to the <HI>Turks</HI> and from <HI>Castel-novo</HI> to the <HI>Morea</HI> the <HI>Galleys</HI> may creep all the way withi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sight of Land, getting refreshments from the shoar upon every occasion, for all that coast is peopled with a sort of <HI>Alba∣nians</HI> who are <HI>Christians,</HI> and utter ene∣mies to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and who upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first sight of our <HI>Christian</HI> Army would take measures to revolt, and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the better to invite and encourage them they ought to be furnished with Arms, and some good <HI>Officers</HI> to conduct and head them.</P>
<P>Passing along the <HI>Morea,</HI> they ought to doe the like, the <HI>Christians</HI> of that Coun∣trey being natural <HI>Greeks,</HI> and although they allow not of our Creed, and may justly fear if we had the power over them, we should oblige them to conform to another <HI>Church,</HI> yet nevertheless being so hardly used as they are, by the tyran∣nies of the <HI>Turkish Government,</HI> they would infallibly revolt and take up Arms against the <HI>Sultan:</HI> My opinion is, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in passing along, they should seize upon two Forts named the one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This is alrea∣dy done by the <HI>Ve∣netians.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Coron,</HI> and the other <HI>Modon,</HI> which are on the
<PB N="39" REF="22"/> Sea-side, near the mouth of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> as likewise upon the City and Castle of <HI>Scio,</HI> the Islands of <HI>Metelin</HI> and <HI>Tenedos,</HI> which are nigh the <HI>Dardanello's,</HI> and full of good Harbors for the security of the Fleets; as also to oblige them to come to their relief. This would prove a thing of no great difficulty, forasmuch as the pride of the <HI>Turk</HI> is come to that height, that he believes the power of all <HI>Christendom</HI> is not sufficient to doe him any prejudice, and upon that score, they have neglected the care ought to be taken in furnishing and repairing their Forts, and keeping good garrisons and stores for their defence, of which they are generally destitute, or but slightly provided, for the reasons aforesaid.</P>
<P>There must, at the same time, be a powerfull Land Army likewise, which should march by <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> and go on to∣wards <HI>Adrianople;</HI> and as I have said, all the common people of <HI>Greece,</HI> who inha∣bit that Countrey, being <HI>Christians,</HI> and there being very few <HI>Turks</HI> amongst them, they would most willingly rise: As to the number that Army should consist of, that of the <HI>Turks</HI> upon such an occasion would be very numerous and strong, and there∣fore ours ought in some measure, if possi∣ble,
<PB N="40" REF="23"/> to equal them to prevent any terrour or dismay at the appearance of the ene¦mies vast numbers.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur de la Noüe</HI> in a Treatise of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speaks of the way to attack and beat the <HI>Turks,</HI> and after what methods the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Army ought to be disposed and con∣ducted, also the numbers of horse and foot he judges to be necessary for that purpose. I shall add nothing to it bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only this, that if the numbers he menti∣ons could be doubled it would be more effectual and secure; but I should be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> opinion, that the Land Army should no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advance so far as to be forced to come to blows with the <HI>Turks</HI> till our <HI>Fleet</HI> had done their work; for, as I told you, being composed of a huge number o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Galleys, Galeasses, Galions,</HI> and <HI>Ships</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> the Victory would be certain, and after the taking of those places before∣named, they ought forthwith to proceed directly to the <HI>Dardanello's,</HI> which are two <HI>Castles</HI> distant two hundred miles from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the one in <HI>Europe</HI> and the other in <HI>Asia,</HI> within Cannon shot of each other, both situate on the Sea-side, which in that place is so nar∣row, that it seems as if Heaven had de∣signed it for the security of <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="23"/> and for the greater Majesty of him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the possessor of it, that it should be so; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or not a Ship that sails to <HI>Constantinople</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an pass or repass that Strait without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave of the <HI>Commanders</HI> of those <HI>Castles,</HI> which are not so strong but they may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asily taken, and ought to be.</P>
<P>I believe, indeed, that the <HI>Turks</HI> Fleet would not stay till the <HI>Christians</HI> came up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hither to them, but that they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome out and meet them, so great is their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resumption.

<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL AND Political Discourse ON <HI>The Causes of the War</HI> IN HUNGARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whose <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Speeches</HI> are commonly of great weight, have a saying to this purpose, <HI>That there is no good but what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, nor no evil but hath an end.</HI> And I, on the contrary find, that the pleasures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd good we enjoy in this life are ever mixed with pain, and that the end of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rouble is but the beginning of another.
<PB N="52" REF="29"/> The happiest of people have oftner reason to complain than to rejoyce; and the unhappy, who are by much the greater number, do most commonly fall from a little misfortune into a bigger. I do re∣member that <HI>George Ragotsky</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilvania</HI> entred into <HI>Poland</HI> victorious, but he came out again flagging his wings; and that thereupon you did reade me a Lecture of the inconstancy of <HI>Fortune,</HI> and shewed me, that it was no new thing to see such revolutions and changes; since oftentimes those have been led about captives to make a triumphant shew, who but a short time before had been themselves triumphant <HI>Conquerours.</HI></P>

<P>Whatever I may have told you heretofore, I always believed, and still hold it for a certain truth, that the grea∣ter part of mankind have much more reason to praise and thank <HI>God</HI> for the benefits they do receive of him, than to implore to be delivered from the evils that afflict them: and yet we hear of more that do complain than give thanks; because we are more sensible of pain than of pleasure. A <HI>Prince</HI> feels not so much pleasure in conquering all his life-time, as affliction to find Fortune turn her back upon him but in one single Battel. A
<PB N="53" REF="29"/> great Man, who had scarce found any thing impossible to be attained to by him, till the age of fifty years, and who had seen the most formidable enemies stoop to his power, tells us after all that <HI>Fortune</HI> is a <HI>Woman,</HI> that she loves the young better than the aged, and therefore retired into solitude, when he found the power of the greatest <HI>Emperour</HI> that ever was, could be so easily baffled. We find some persons who will needs have the liberty of undertaking whatever their capricious fancies suggest, and then loudly com∣plain when their attempts (begun with∣out consideration and judgment) end in misfortune and disgrace. It is certain, that <HI>Divine providence</HI> (which by the vulgar is called <HI>Fortune</HI>) does often pull down the pride of the most successfull and haughty, that they may know the good they had received proceeded more from his bounty than their deserts. We find some <HI>Politicians</HI> whose Eagle eyes can see every thing abroad, are yet stark blind to what does threaten both the ruine of their Countrey and themselves at home. I might confirm this truth by infinite ex∣amples, but I shall pass them by in silence to listen to your questions, and to answer to them as exactly as I am able.</P>

<P>Let us then speak of the War that is now in <HI>Hungary:</HI> And forasmuch as a discourse you made to me about three years since, brought us within sight of a black cloud that was gathering in <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI> and which hath since produced such a tempest, as hath born down <HI>George Ragotsky</HI> and <HI>Jona Kemin,</HI> to raise <HI>Abafti</HI> to the Throne: entertain me with the cause and sequel of that change, that I may the better know whence it happened that the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> who had been only an idle Spectator in the Tragedy, (which <HI>Europe</HI> was acting for thirty years together) should now attack his Neigh∣bours without provocation, and give us occasion to take up Arms, while we are in a capacity to unite in such a manner as may give him cause to repent his under∣taking.

<P>Although your will hath ever been a law to me, yet is it not without some kind of regret that I now undertake to

And that you may have the more reason to acquiesce in what I shall tell you, I will take my rise from the very first source, and represent in Epitome, all what the <HI>Turks</HI> have done in <HI>Hungary</HI> since the time that <HI>Bajazet</HI> came thither to support their rebellion, and foment their discord. I know the ignorant will say, that the <HI>Turk</HI> hath little or no regard to justice when he undertakes a War; and that the advantage he thinks to meet with in his enterprizes is ever the principal motive of his designs. For my own part, I own there is little faith to be hoped for or expected from an Infidel, and that many times the <HI>Turk</HI> hath no other aim in his attempts but his own in∣terest: But withall it is not impossible for him to cloak those designs his ambition prompts him to act in the world, with some fair and specious pretence. And for this reason I will let you plainly see, why the <HI>Ottomans</HI> think and believe they have just cause to preserve <HI>Transilvania,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="31"/> and by the same means you will come to understand and know the ground we have to defend it against him, and how it comes to pass we are obliged to raise great forces, and to demand the assistance of strangers.

<P>You ask and desire two things to∣gether, which seem incompatible; how∣ever, I shall endeavour to joyn them in one, and despair not to perform the task, provided you will be very attentive. In the year 1350, or, according to others, 1383, <HI>Lewis</HI> the first of that name reigned peaceably over the people of <HI>Transilvania, Moldavia, Valachia, Mysia, Dalmatia</HI> and <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> which were of the appurte∣nances of his Kingdom: but his quiet was disturbed by a misfortune as little dreamt on as foreseen. <HI>Jane</HI> Queen of <HI>Naples,</HI> a most dissol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te <HI>Princess,</HI> preferring some young <HI>Neapolitans</HI> before King <HI>Andrew</HI> her Husband, she cruelly put him to death. The news whereof, and the Let∣ters from such as were struck with hor∣rour at this <HI>Paricide,</HI> did easily prompt the Soul of <HI>Lewis</HI> to a just revenge. This generous <HI>Prince,</HI> believing that both ho∣nour and justice obliged him to take up Arms to revenge the death of his Brother, raised a great Army, and went to <HI>Naples</HI> to bring the guilty to condign punishment. His expedition was prosperous, and ha∣ving put <HI>Jane</HI> to flight, and routed
<PB N="58" REF="32"/> her Confederates, he brought the Rebels to reason, and punished the chief abet∣tors of that detestable <HI>Paricide.</HI> Which being done, and all things appeased, he thought his own ancient <HI>Kingdom</HI> might require his presence, and therefore was contriving to return again, not neglecting at the same time any means to preserve his new one. He had divers great person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Army, and amongst others <HI>Stephe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the <HI>Vaivode</HI> of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> whom h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held in great esteem, although he was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet but young.

The <HI>King</HI> had left no other <HI>Successor</HI> but only a <HI>Daughter</HI> named <HI>Mary</HI> who was betroathed to <HI>Sigismund</HI> of <HI>Luxemburg, King</HI> of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The tender Age of that Princess, the inconstant humour of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and the practices of our <HI>Vaivode,</HI> caused the said <HI>Mary</HI> to be so much despised, that many openly decla∣red they would never obey a <HI>Girl.</HI> Then this <HI>Cabal</HI> knowing the craft and dexteri∣ty of the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Zagabria,</HI> who was an <HI>Italian</HI> by birth and inclination, they

He spake of it to the Queen his Wife, who omitted neither Argu∣ments, nor tears to disswade him from undertaking a thing so dangerous by reason of the inconstancy of those People, and shamefull for the injustice he must commit by dispossessing one so nearly re∣lated to him, without any cause. But Ambition overcame reason and equity. <HI>Charles</HI> equipped a great <HI>Fleet</HI> and attended with an Army worthy of such a Prince, he took harbor in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and went in few days to <HI>Zagabria,</HI> where he met part of those Grandees that favoured his design. From thence he passed on to <HI>Buda,</HI> and although he found resistance by the resolution of <HI>Nicholas Gara,</HI> and some other faithfull Servants of <HI>Queen Mary;</HI> yet did he make a shift to settle
<PB N="61" REF="33"/> himself by rhe interest and favour of the <HI>Transilvanian.</HI> Then <HI>Sigismund King</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> the Husband of the said <HI>Queen,</HI> perceiving the loss of <HI>Hungary</HI> to be ine∣vitable, retired into his own <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> imagined he had fixed the Wheel of Fortune. His joy notwith∣standing was but short-lived, and his Usurpation of no longer duration, than other violent things are wont to be. <HI>Sigismund</HI> was again invited back by the new <HI>King</HI>'s Enemies, and having van∣quished <HI>Charles,</HI> slain or drove away eve∣ry one that opposed him, he recovered all that rightly belonged to <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife.</P>

<P>Those <HI>Burgundians</HI> kept company, and stood and fell with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> that died in the said Battel. But this was only the beginning of the unhappi∣ness of those People. Yet under the Reign of <HI>Sigismund,</HI> and during that of <HI>Albertus</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> his <HI>Successour,</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> gained little in <HI>Hungary:</HI> He would needs proceed step by step, and seised upon <HI>Constantinople,</HI> e're he set his mind seriously upon other matters. However, this had taught him the way to come
<PB N="63" REF="34"/> and visit us. <HI>Mahomet</HI> the First beat the <HI>Hungarians</HI> near <HI>Taubemberg Anno,</HI> 1400. And thus the Infidels advanced by little and little, till after the Death of <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Austria.</HI> That <HI>Prince</HI> left no Children; but his <HI>Wife</HI> was big when he deceased. Her being with Child caused the division that was then bred amongst the <HI>Grandees</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom.</HI> Some would needs have them wait till the delivery of the <HI>Queen,</HI> before they thought of the <HI>Election</HI> of a <HI>King.</HI> Others making objections against their becoming subject to a Child, in case the <HI>Queen</HI> should be safely brought to bed of a <HI>Prince,</HI> they resolved to chuse a <HI>King</HI> able to govern them. <HI>Hungary</HI> be∣ing thus divided, one part of the <HI>Gran∣dees</HI> sent to offer the <HI>Kingdom</HI> to <HI>Uladislaus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Casimir, King</HI> of <HI>Poland:</HI> The other party preferred <HI>Ladislaus</HI> Son of <HI>Albertus</HI> before him, though he were yet in his <HI>Cradle;</HI> where notwithstanding they set the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> upon his Head.</P>

<P>This division of minds and interests brought <HI>Amurath</HI> the II. into the Field, who taking advantage of the discords he observed in <HI>Hungary,</HI> marched into the very heart of the Country, and besieged <HI>Alba-Regalis.</HI> He could not however obtain what he desired, on the contrary he lost most of his Army, and was for∣ced to raise the Siege. This affront en∣raged the <HI>Tyrant,</HI> who to be revenged, raised new forces, and entred again into <HI>Hungary,</HI> where he was defeated by <HI>John Huniades Corvinus.</HI> This action gave not more reputation to <HI>Huniades,</HI> than desire in the <HI>Turk</HI> to be revenged. To this purpose, he sent two of the bravest <HI>Ge∣nerals</HI> he had to oppose <HI>Huniades,</HI> who alway commanded the Armies of King <HI>Uladislaus.</HI> These were <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Mezets,</HI> who falling upon <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Transilva∣nia,</HI> filled them with all the miseries of a cruel War. <HI>Huniades</HI> ran in to their As∣sistance, and overtook the Enemy laden with Spoil and Plunder. He charged them stoutly, but unfortunately, since he was repulsed, and put to flight. <HI>A∣murath</HI> encouraged with this Victory, thought now of nothing but ravaging the <HI>Christian</HI> Countries. <HI>Mezets</HI> returned in∣to <HI>Hungary,</HI> put all to Fire and Sword,
<PB N="65" REF="35"/> and having ruined it, and cut the throats of infinite numbers of People, intended a retreat. Then was it that <HI>Huniades</HI> be∣lieved he might find an opportunity to repair the former loss he had sustain'd.

<P>And yet it proved unfortunate; and to the ruine of <HI>Hungary;</HI> which hapned thus. <HI>Amurath</HI> II. of that Name, the <HI>Turkish Sultan,</HI> finding <HI>Europe</HI> combi∣ned against him, and fearing the Forces of <HI>Asia,</HI> consulted his own prudence, and with admirable Craft and Wisedom, obtained that Peace of <HI>Uladislaus</HI> he ex∣tremely desired. He sent <HI>Ambassadors</HI> under pretence of treating concerning the liberty of <HI>Carambo;</HI> but in effect it was to disperse that storm that threatned him. These <HI>Agents</HI> well knowing what influence the <HI>Despote</HI> had in the <HI>King's Counsel,</HI> and in the heart of <HI>John Hunia∣des Corvinus,</HI> believed that if they could but gain him, they should gain all their ends. They planted therefore two Bat∣teries against him, which nothing can resist, I mean <HI>Affection</HI> and <HI>Interest.</HI> They offer'd the restitution of his Chil∣dren, and his Estate, if he could but ob∣tain
<PB N="68" REF="37"/> of <HI>Uladislaus</HI> what they reasonably desired of him. This proposition pleasing the <HI>Despote,</HI> he soon brought <HI>Huniades Corvinus</HI> to approve of it; and these two being thus agreed, they found no great difficulty in persuading the <HI>King</HI> to an accommodation. The <HI>Peace</HI> was made, the <HI>Turk</HI> withdrew all the Garrisons he had in <HI>Mysia,</HI> restored them effectually, and exactly performed all he had promi∣sed. But whilst the parties were thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> employ'd in the executing of this <HI>Teeaty;</HI> Letters arrived from <HI>Greece,</HI> which assu∣red them that those People, who knew nothing of the conclusion of this <HI>Peace,</HI> expected every moment when the game would be begun; for that they were fully resolved not to stand with Armes accross like idle Spectators, the absence of the <HI>Sultan</HI> who was in <HI>Asia,</HI> giving them a very favourable opportunity to push on their designs. The <HI>Italian Fleet,</HI> which advanced towards the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> desired the same thing with great eager∣ness. These Letters having been read in the <HI>Senate,</HI> even those that had been most forward and zealous for the <HI>Peace,</HI> were now sorry it was concluded: But none durst mention the breaking of an agree∣ment, which had been confirmed by a
<PB N="69" REF="37"/> solemn Oath. Then <HI>Julian,</HI> the <HI>Cardi∣nal Legate,</HI> powerfull in persuasion, of great credit and eloquence, prompted by an indiscreet Zeal, and an impious piety, undertook by a discourse as lear∣ned as it was vehement, to prove that they ought to break that <HI>Treaty</HI> made with an <HI>Infidel.</HI> <Q>He chid the scrupu∣lous, encouraged the timorous, com∣forted the afflicted, and wholly encli∣ned both the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> to a rupture. He said, he well foresaw the disadvantages of that Peace; but had not opposed it, lest he should have seemed to accuse <HI>Huni∣ades</HI> of imprudence, and have appea∣red cruel towards the <HI>Despote</HI> of <HI>Mysia,</HI> who could not have redeemed his Children from the Tyranny of the <HI>Turk,</HI> but by the said Peace. He assu∣red them they might safely do it, since they might justly and reasonably break their Faith with the <HI>Turk,</HI> who by his finess and craft had broken the bonds of a <HI>Christian</HI> alliance: He represen∣ted how that, indeed, the <HI>Hungarians</HI> could not grant a Peace to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> without first having the consent of their Brethren: and that an Oath unjustly made, could not oblige without inju∣stice.
<PB N="70" REF="38"/> He endeavour'd to make out that the Oath, they had made to <HI>Amu∣rath,</HI> was null; that it did not bind their <HI>Consciences;</HI> and that they might rely upon him in this particular as be∣ing most knowing in Affairs of that Nature; and concluded that they ought to assemble their Forces, march towards <HI>Thrace,</HI> and joyn with the other <HI>Christians,</HI> before the over-sight they had committed should be con∣veyed farther into <HI>Europe.</HI></Q> These and the like arguments and reasons, uttered with Authority, and by a most eloquent tongue, inspired the <HI>Hungarians</HI> to de∣clare unanimously, that they would ra∣ther lose their lives, than forsake their Brethren at this juncture. To this pur∣pose, the Army was drawn forth, and <HI>John Huniades,</HI> marching in the Van, the <HI>King</HI> followed with the rest of the Army. This <HI>Prince</HI> being on his way, <HI>Dracula</HI> the <HI>Vaivode</HI> of <HI>Valachia</HI> went to wait upon him, and told him, he admired at the boldness of his attempt, in going to attack the <HI>Turk</HI> with so inconside∣rable an Army; that his Enemy went a-hunting with as many men as he had then about him; that he advised him to return again. This Counsel was rejected,
<PB N="71" REF="38"/> and the <HI>Vaivode</HI> having left four thousand Horse with the <HI>King</HI> under the Conduct of his own Son, he retired. <HI>Amurath</HI> being informed that <HI>Hungary</HI> was arming against him, quitted <HI>Asia,</HI> and returned into <HI>Europe,</HI> got his Forces a-foot, and the soonest he could possibly, attacked <HI>Uladislaus</HI> at <HI>Varnes,</HI> a City of <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> and defeated him intirely. The event of which Battel, so fatal to the <HI>Christians,</HI> and fortunate to those <HI>Infidels,</HI> made it apparent by the Death of the King of <HI>Hungary, Julian</HI> the Pope's Legate, and an infinite number of brave men besides, that we ought to keep our promised Faith; and that God will punish the perfidious, let them cloak the Crime with what pretence soever they please. It's said that <HI>Amurath,</HI> observing his men had the worst at the beginning of the Fight, drew out of his Bosom the <HI>Treaty</HI> that had been signed between him and the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and lifting his Eyes to <HI>Heaven,</HI> said more than once with great earnestness and affection, <HI>Jesus Christ, behold the Agreement here the Christians had made with me; to which they have sworn by thy Divinity, and which they now break in Derision of thee: Now, if thou, O Christ, art God, as they do say, revenge I
<PB N="72" REF="39"/> beseech thee, an injury done to thy self, and to me; and let even those that do not yet truly know thy Name be witness, that thou canst punish such as violate the sanctity of those promises which they had sealed with thy sacred Name.</HI> Which Prayer was fol∣lowed, or answered, with the total de∣feat of the Christians. The King's head was fixed upon the point of a Lance, and carried into many parts of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> as a token of an entire Victory. The Body of the <HI>Cardinal Julian,</HI> who per∣swaded them to this breach of Faith, was found naked and pierced with many Wounds. The Epitaph of this King who proved both valiant and happy, so long as he was carefull to make good his pro∣mises, is worthy of your notice. Thus it is,

<P><HI>God</HI> intending to punish this un∣happy <HI>Kingdom,</HI> yet not wholly destroy it, reserved <HI>John Huniades,</HI> who finding things were in a most desperate condition after the death of the King, saved him∣self by flight. The following year, the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who till then had rejected <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> the posthumus Son of the <HI>Em∣perour Albertus</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> did unani∣mously acknowledge him their King, being but five years old. And foras∣much as he could not sway the <HI>Sceptre,</HI> because of his Childhood, they gave the management of all Affairs to <HI>John Hu∣niades Corvinus,</HI> who two years after∣wards augmented the Triumphs of <HI>Amu∣rath,</HI> by the loss of two and twenty thousand men, that were sent to oppose him. Some time after <HI>Amurath</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> died at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and for Successour left <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. his Son, who surpassed all his Ancestours in Greatness of Courage, and Subtilty of Mind.

<PB N="74" REF="40"/> in the third Year of his Reign, and took it in fifty Days, by the 29th. of <HI>May,</HI> 1453. This loss abated the Courage of the <HI>Christians,</HI> raised that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and gave him hopes of adding <HI>Hungary</HI> to the acquisition he had made of <HI>Greece.</HI> To this purpose he ravaged <HI>Mysia,</HI> and with two hundred and fifty thousand Men besieged the City of <HI>Belgrade;</HI> called by the Ancients <HI>Alba Greca:</HI> but the place being well defended by <HI>Huni∣ades,</HI> he lost almost all his Army, and an hundred great pieces of Cannon: <HI>Huni∣ades</HI> did not long survive this brave Action, for he died the 8th. of <HI>September,</HI> 1456. And the <HI>Turk</HI> turning his thoughts towards <HI>Persia,</HI> and against <HI>Italy,</HI> left <HI>Hungary</HI> in quiet: hoping the ambition of the <HI>Grandees,</HI> and the Youth of the <HI>King</HI> would create some troubles, during the peace, and that those troubles would give him an opportunity to subject that <HI>Kingdom</HI> by pretending to spare it.</P>

<P>I am of the same mind with your self. But <HI>Peter de Reva,</HI> says that he transcribed those papers out of the Ori∣ginals, and adds some other particulars far more incredible. He tells us in his fifth <HI>Century</HI> of his <HI>Hungarian Monarchy,</HI> that the <HI>Emperour</HI> made a seizure of the moneys which the Nobility and Clergy had raised to supply <HI>Mathias</HI> in the War he had undertaken against the <HI>Turk,</HI> and that the Pope helped to drain his Countrey of Treasure, ordering Collec∣tions to be there made for the <HI>Knights of Rhodes.</HI> All this did not hinder <HI>Stephen Battory,</HI> and <HI>Paul Canisius,</HI> fighting under his auspicious Banner, from defeating <HI>Ha∣libek,</HI> leaving threescore thousand of his men dead upon the spot. Nor himself from regaining <HI>Jaitza,</HI> and reducing <HI>Bosnia</HI> to his obedience, fighting with his own hand. Notwithstanding he was for∣ced to make a <HI>Truce</HI> with <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and that <HI>Tyrant</HI> being dead, <HI>Anno</HI> 1481. he did his utmost to renew the War to ad∣vantage. To which purpose he desired
<PB N="79" REF="42"/> pass-ports for some <HI>Ambassadors</HI> he in∣tended to send to him, but could not obtain any. He also entreated the <HI>Pope</HI> to let him have <HI>Zemini,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that he might make use of him against his Brother <HI>Bajazet,</HI> who was newly seated in the <HI>Turkish Throne,</HI> and he refu∣sed it. This refusal was the more sensi∣ble, as being onely upon the considerati∣on of a little Summ of money he must have lost, which <HI>Bajazet</HI> had promised to pay him annually; whilst he obliged himself to confirm the same <HI>Truce</HI> with <HI>Bajazet,</HI> as had been made with <HI>Maho∣met</HI> his Father. Some time after, these ssightings of the <HI>Emperour</HI> becoming in∣supportable to a man of his generous Spirit, brought it to an open War. Which War proved so favourable to <HI>Ma∣thias,</HI> that having subdued the greatest part of <HI>Austria,</HI> and at length taken <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Newstadt,</HI> which are the chie∣fest Bulwarks; He likewise carried his Arms against <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and made himself Master of the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Silesia</HI> and <HI>Moravia.</HI> Then <HI>Casimir</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> willing to have his share of the quarry, came int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Silesia</HI> with a powerfull Army, and by the intercession of the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> these two <HI>Kings</HI> were
<PB N="80" REF="43"/> brought to an agreement: So that, <HI>Ma∣thias,</HI> and <HI>Uladislaus</HI> the Son of <HI>King Casi∣mir,</HI> might both bear the quality of <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> But <HI>Uladislaus</HI> was to enjoy the <HI>Electoral</HI> dignity solely, and as to the <HI>Kingdom, Mathias</HI> to possess the <HI>Provin∣ces</HI> of <HI>Moravia, Silesia</HI> and <HI>Lusatia,</HI> re∣deemable after his death for four hundred thousand Crowns. Whilst <HI>Mathias</HI> was thus employ'd in these Wars, the <HI>Turk</HI> brake the <HI>Truce</HI> and seized upon <HI>Killen,</HI> and <HI>Nestar-Alba,</HI> which were then consi∣derable <HI>Forts</HI> upon the River <HI>Danube.</HI> In fine, <HI>Mathias,</HI> having reigned five years at <HI>Vienna,</HI> whilst they were treating a∣bout the surrender of it, died there the Tuesday before <HI>Easter,</HI> in the Month of <HI>March,</HI> 1450 His Body was conveyed to <HI>Alba-Regalis,</HI> where he was interred amongst the rest of the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Hun∣gary.</HI></P>

<P>After the decause of <HI>Mathias Cor∣vinus,</HI> who having no lawfull Child, had
<PB N="81" REF="43"/> wished, they would chuse for his Suc∣cessour, <HI>John Huniades</HI> his Natural Son, the Spirit of Division came amongst the <HI>Hungarians.</HI> Four <HI>Princes</HI> pretended to the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> divided into four <HI>Cabals,</HI> did each of them favour most that person, whom they esteemed most worthy of that ho∣nour. <HI>John,</HI> the Son of the late <HI>King Mathias</HI> had the Suffrages of such, as revered in him the eminent Vertues both of his Father and <HI>Grandfather;</HI> and who were more desirous to obey a Na∣tive, than a Stranger. The others were of different opinions: Some desired <HI>Al∣bert Jagelon,</HI> youngest Son of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> on whom the <HI>Pope</HI> bestowed Arms, to fight against <HI>Uladislaus</HI> his o∣ther Son, who was likewise one of the Competitors; the Father believing that <HI>Uladislaus</HI> ought to be contented and fully satisfied with the Crown of <HI>Bohe∣mia.</HI> In fine, some inclined to <HI>Maximi∣lian,</HI> Son of the <HI>Emperour Frederick,</HI> who was excluded from the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> because the faction that sided with <HI>Uladislaus Jagelon,</HI> prevailed above his. During this <HI>interregnum,</HI> the <HI>Emperour</HI> recover'd all that <HI>Mathias Corvinus</HI> had taken from him in <HI>Austria;</HI> and at length
<PB N="82" REF="44"/> <HI>Uladislaus</HI> ascended the <HI>Throne.</HI> The be∣ginning of this <HI>Reign</HI> was troublesome: <HI>Albert</HI> the Brother of <HI>Uladislaus,</HI> assisted by the Brothers of <HI>Casimir King</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> their <HI>Father,</HI> besieged <HI>Cassovia,</HI> the <HI>Capital</HI> of the upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> and gave him much perplexity on that side. <HI>Blaisius Magger,</HI> Servant to <HI>John Corvinus,</HI> an∣gry his Master had been rejected, refused to give the <HI>Crown</HI> to the New <HI>King,</HI> which he had in keeping at <HI>Vice-grade,</HI> endured a Siege, and did not surrender it, till commanded so to do by <HI>Corvinus. Max∣imilian</HI> having regained his places in <HI>Austria,</HI> advanced towards <HI>Hungary;</HI> and being assisted by those that had favour'd him, during the <HI>interregnum,</HI> he made a considerable progress there. In fine; <HI>Uladislaus,</HI> growing weary of so many disturbances, came to an agreement with <HI>Maximilian,</HI> the Articles whereof were so odious to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> that <HI>Emeri∣cus Prini, Palatin</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> caused it to be proclaimed thorough all the <HI>Sub∣urbs</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Presburg,</HI> that he did not consent to them, nor ever would give his consent thereto. This genero∣sity, however lasted not long: For <HI>Prini;</HI> gained by Bribes, subscribed those <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> which gave the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="44"/> to the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> in case <HI>Uladislaus</HI> should happen to dye without Children. Thus was their distemper cured by a remedy odious to the whole <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and this storm was followed by another. <HI>Albertus</HI> the Brother of <HI>Uladislaus,</HI> seeing him seated on the <HI>Throne</HI> against his Will, did for the se∣cond time besiege <HI>Cassovia:</HI> but think∣ing to take, himself was taken, and for∣ced to promise his Brother, that he would let him live in quiet. Shortly after <HI>Ulad slaus</HI> married, and in three or four Years, he had <HI>Anne</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> who are so famous in <HI>History. Anne</HI> was married to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> Grandson to the <HI>Emperour Maximilian,</HI> who had divers Children by her whose posterity <HI>Reigns</HI> to this day in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Hungary.</HI> The accidents of the birth, the life and death of <HI>Lewis</HI> were extraordinary. He was born without a Skin: which made his people believe he would be stript of his <HI>Kingdom;</HI> He wore a beard at fifteen years of age, and became gray at eighteen, which made every one guess his life would be but short. He died in a <HI>Morass</HI> at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> not being above twenty years old; and his <HI>Kingdom</HI> fell most part of it under the power of the
<PB N="84" REF="45"/> <HI>Mahometans;</HI> which demonstrates, that those prodigies were but too true, as you shall now hear. <HI>Uladislaus</HI> having no in∣tention to make good what he had pro∣mised to <HI>Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> caused his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> to be <HI>Crowned</HI> at <HI>Alba-Regalis,</HI> by <HI>Thomas Cardinal</HI> of <HI>Strigonia, Anno</HI> 1508. and the following year cau∣sed him to be <HI>Crowned King</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> at <HI>Prague,</HI> being as yet but three years of Age. These things could not be done, without an extreme dissatisfaction and disgust to the <HI>Emperour,</HI> but <HI>Uladislaus</HI> maintaining a Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> and having a support from <HI>Poland,</HI> his <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> was forced to defer his resentment.</P>

<P>Towards the latter end of <HI>Uladis∣laus</HI> his Life, and after the death of <HI>Ba∣jazet, Hungary</HI> begun to fall into a Civil War, which had like to have destroy'd it utterly.

<PB N="85" REF="45"/>
<P>The <HI>Pope</HI> approved of it, and promis'd to contribute to it; but prevented by death, he left the care thereof to his Suc∣cessors.

<P>That which you tell me of the <HI>Hungarians</HI> makes me find, that they have a great deal of affection and respect for their <HI>King,</HI> if he be <HI>valiant,</HI> and that they would willingly change him for another when he is not so.</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Warlike People do gladly see their <HI>Kings</HI> on Horse-back, when any oc∣casion requires it for the defence of their Countrey: And although experience teaches us, that the safety and life of a <HI>King,</HI> is the preservation of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> yet they love to see them at the Head of their Armies. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> have rea∣son notwithstanding to be of another mind, for <HI>History</HI> will discover, what an addition of misfortune it is to lose their <HI>King,</HI> when they lose a Battel. <HI>Lewis</HI> I. having succeeded to <HI>Uladislaus</HI> his <HI>Father</HI> in his tender youth, was despised by <HI>Sul∣tan Solyman,</HI> who knowing his weakness, and the divisions that were then on foot betwixt the great ones in <HI>Christendom,</HI> thought it was then the onely time to subdue <HI>Hungary.</HI> To this purpose, he made <HI>Peace</HI> with the <HI>Persian,</HI> and attack'd <HI>Lewis</HI> with all his Forces. This <HI>young King,</HI> finding himself alone uncapable to resist so potent an Enemy, desired the o∣ther <HI>Christian Princes</HI> to send him aid;
<PB N="87" REF="46"/> and not suffer the Bullwark of <HI>Chistendom</HI> to fall into the hands of the common E∣nemies of their <HI>Faith.</HI> His prayers were in vain, while <HI>Christendom</HI> was tearing it self in pieces; and <HI>Lewis</HI> was obliged to take the Field in his own defence, before he had gotten all his own Forces toge∣ther. The <HI>Turk</HI> had already past the <HI>Save,</HI> and the <HI>Drave,</HI> when meeting the <HI>Hungarians</HI> in small numbers, and ill pro∣vided of a <HI>General,</HI> he easily defeated them; and so entirely, that the <HI>King,</HI> and the greater part of those that follow∣ed him, perish'd in the Battel, or in their Flight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard say, that two and twenty thousand <HI>Christians</HI> died in that Battel, and that besides the Horses for service, five thousand Waggons, four∣score pieces of great <HI>Cannon,</HI> and six hun∣dred lesser ones, with all their equipage, fell into the <HI>Victor</HI>'s hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>The loss of the Battel was but a small matter, in comparison of what did follow. The <HI>Turk</HI> took, and slew in <HI>Hungary,</HI> above two hundred thousand persons: He set his foot so far within the Countrey, that they could never drive him out thence; and at this time, we find how difficult a matter it is to wrest any
<PB N="88" REF="47"/> considerable post out of his hands. So that we may well set a mark upon the 29. day of <HI>August</HI> in 1526, as one of the most fatal, that ever afflicted <HI>Christendom.</HI> This <HI>King</HI> died without Children, and his want of issue strenghtned the right and pretensions the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> had to possess the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Hungary.</HI> How∣ever they found the <HI>Hungarians</HI> but little inclin'd to favour them. <HI>John Zapoliha Count</HI> of <HI>Sebusa, Vayvode</HI> of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> who came too late to defend the <HI>Crown,</HI> thought he was come time enough to put it upon his own head. He had for a long while employ'd his money, and used all his industry to gain the affections of the whole <HI>Kingdom;</HI> and by the defeat of <HI>George Sekel,</HI> and of the populace who had made him their <HI>King,</HI> a little before, he had made some steps, and open'd his way towards the <HI>Throne.</HI> Finding him∣self therefore in a condition that might justly make him hope for it, he pray'd, and exhorted the Grandees, each in par∣ticular, not to suffer the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Election</HI> they had to fall, but to take generous resolutions in the following <HI>Diet.</HI> He re∣presents to them that <HI>Hungary</HI> was never very fortunate under the command of a Stranger. That <HI>Sigismund</HI> the <HI>Bohemian,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="47"/> and <HI>Uladislaus</HI> the <HI>Polander,</HI> had made it most apparent, by their defeats, at <HI>Nico∣polis,</HI> at <HI>Colembat</HI> and at <HI>Varna,</HI> that Strangers rule but very unsuccesfully in this <HI>Kingdom.</HI> He endeavour'd to make them believe, that if possible a Stranger could reign gloriously in <HI>Hungary,</HI> yet it were better much to have a <HI>King</HI> of their own Nation. That divers people, and the best governed in <HI>Europe,</HI> exclude the <HI>Women</HI> from the <HI>Crown,</HI> for fear lest it should pass into the hands of Strangers. That the <HI>Hungarian Nobility</HI> were not so degenerated, but that they might find some heads amongst them worthy to wear a <HI>Crown;</HI> and although he were none of the most deserving, yet he pre∣sumed himself was not incapable either to <HI>Govern</HI> a great <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or to defend this with his <HI>Sword.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>The advice, and the merits of <HI>Za∣poliha,</HI> touched the greater part of the <HI>Hungarian Nobles</HI> so home, that they put the reins of the <HI>Government</HI> into his hands, and caused him to be <HI>Crowned</HI> by <HI>Paul de Verda Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Strigonia,</HI> upon St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s day in 1526.

<P><HI>Solyman</HI> could not do all he would, but desiring to make good his promise, he took the Field with a dreadfull Army, and marched towards <HI>Hungary</HI> in the Spring. <HI>King John</HI> being advertised of his approach, went to receive him at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> accompanied by <HI>Lascus,</HI> and the bravest Troops of the <HI>Hungarian No∣bility,</HI> he could possibly draw together, and in the presence of them all, acknow∣ledg'd him for his Lord. There it was, that the <HI>Sultan</HI> rising a little from his Seat, gave him his hand, assured him, that no∣thing could be more delightfull to him than to relieve the afflicted, who were unjustly persecuted by their Enemies; commanded him to be of good courage, and said, he would restore to him all that he could recover from his adversary.

<P>It's a wonder, that <HI>Solyman,</HI> who came off so scurvily in <HI>Austria,</HI> did not, to repair his loss, retain <HI>Hungary</HI> for him∣self. For I have heard it affirmed, that the <HI>Turk</HI> takes little heed to keep his pro∣mise.</P>

<P><HI>Solyman</HI> did like those that break young Horses, he made use of this mild∣ness to allure the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and gave up to <HI>John</HI> that which he believed he was not able to hold. Then <HI>King John,</HI> having good reason to fear the <HI>Turk</HI> would be weary of assisting him, and finding his affairs in an ill posture, sent the same <HI>Las∣cus</HI> to <HI>Vienna</HI> whom he had employ'd at the <HI>Port.</HI> This great Man obtained a truce for a year; during which the two <HI>Kings</HI> came to an agreement, which somewhat took off the edge of the former bitterness betwixt them. By this agreement <HI>John</HI> was to enjoy the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> till his death; and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> or one of his <HI>Sons</HI> was to succeed him. And because it was not impossible but <HI>John</HI> might leave some Children, it was said, that if he had a <HI>Son,</HI> that <HI>Son</HI> should possess all the <HI>Lands, Cities</HI> and <HI>Castles,</HI> that belonged to <HI>John,</HI> before he was <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Hungary.</HI> And moreover, besides the things above-men∣tioned, he should be <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Transilvania.</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="51"/> This <HI>Treaty</HI> was ill observed. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> caused <HI>Transilvania</HI> to be attaqued by <HI>Balthasar Banfy; Sclavonia,</HI> by <HI>John Co∣eranerus,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Sebusa,</HI> by <HI>Leonard Baron of Veltz.</HI> All these attempts proved vain, by the prudence of <HI>King John,</HI> and the valour of the <HI>Monk George Martinusias</HI> his Favorite. And for this cause, they came to another agreement. The <HI>Calm</HI> which this King enjoy'd after that <HI>Tempest</HI> was blown over, gave him leasure to think of his marriage. To this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd he sent unto <HI>Sigismond King of Poland,</HI> to demand <HI>Isabella,</HI> or <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> his Daughter; and having obtained her, his <HI>Nuptials,</HI> and the <HI>Coronation</HI> of the <HI>Queen</HI> were made with great Solemnities.</P>

<P>In this affair, <HI>King John</HI> was like unto him that holds a <HI>Wolf</HI> by the <HI>Ears:</HI> He found there was as much cause of fear on the behalf of <HI>Solyman,</HI> as from his competitor to the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> and he thought he might have better hopes in a <HI>Christian Prince,</HI> than from an Infidel. Yet so it fell out, that in the end, his Suc∣cessors submitted to the <HI>Turk,</HI> to preserve part of their Dignity: as we are going to see. Some while after the Marriage of <HI>King John, Stephen Maillats,</HI> and some others, took up Arms against him, in be∣half of <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> Then <HI>John</HI> willing to extinguish the Fire, before it grew to a greater head, left the <HI>Queen</HI> at <HI>Buda,</HI> and went into <HI>Transilvania;</HI> where he freely pardon'd those that confessed and were sorry for their faults; which <HI>Clemency</HI> cau∣sed many to return to their Duty. But <HI>Mai∣lats</HI> retired to the strong <HI>Castle</HI> of <HI>Pogaras,</HI> to wait for the assistance that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was sending to him, under the conduct of <HI>Nadasdy.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> besieged him there, and took it after a long Siege. In the mean time a Couriere comes, who brings him News of the Birth of a <HI>Son,</HI> whom God had sent him. Such News being very pleasing to those that have no Children, and especially to people advanced in
<PB N="99" REF="52"/> years, we may imagine that <HI>King John</HI> received it with great joy. This invited him to drink to some excess, after the <HI>Hungarian</HI> fashion. And that excess in∣creasing some distemper he had, he died at <HI>Sassebes,</HI> a few days after the Birth of his <HI>Son,</HI> in the 53. year of his Age. His death was concealed, as much as it was possible; but at length it was made pub∣lick with the tenor of his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Testa∣ment.</HI> By it, the <HI>King</HI> declared his Son the universal Heir of all his Estate: and <HI>George Martinisius Tutor</HI> to the said <HI>Prince.</HI> Some days before he died, the <HI>King</HI> had exhorted the <HI>Hungarian Nobility</HI> to have a regard to the honour of the <HI>Nation,</HI> and to prefer his Son before any other when they came to elect a <HI>King:</HI> assuring them that the <HI>Turk</HI> would take care to protect him, if they had recourse to his Arms. The prayers and request of a dying <HI>King,</HI> and the fear and aversion the <HI>Hungarians</HI> had of submitting to a stranger, obliged some to set the <HI>Crown</HI> upon the <HI>Infants</HI> Head on the day he was Baptized, and to send to the <HI>Port,</HI> to demand assistance of <HI>Solyman.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Kingdom of Hungary</HI> is very un∣happy, yet hath suffer'd no more than it have deserved. It is a most shame∣full
<PB N="100" REF="53"/> thing, that a <HI>Christian King</HI> upon his death-bed, should exhort his Subjects to apply themselves to the <HI>Turk,</HI> to free his posterity from the obligation himself had imposed upon them by a Sacred Oath. It is great want of prudence and policy to Crown an Infant, when it must make him become the object of the anger and envy of a potent <HI>Prince</HI> his next neighbour. It is an unsufferable impiety, to call upon an <HI>Infidel</HI> for aid, before 'tis known, whe∣ther the person we suspect and fear, will exceed the bounds of reason in his de∣mands. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> had lived more at ease, would they but have made good those promises their <HI>Kings</HI> had engaged them to perform, and the <HI>Turk</HI> had been confin'd within much narrower bounds; if the house of <HI>Austria</HI> had not been obstruc∣ted in their just pretensions.</P>

<P>When a <HI>Countrey</HI> is to be lost, every thing contributes towards its ruine. Those <HI>Kingdoms</HI> that have changed their <HI>Masters</HI> have been the chief contrivers of their own misfortunes. <HI>Hungary</HI> was become so depraved, that every one gloried in his inconstancy and treachery: But let us resume the thrid of our discourse, and draw nearer to our own times. King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> being informed of the death
<PB N="101" REF="53"/> of his adversary, sent <HI>Nicholas Count of Salmes</HI> to the <HI>Widow,</HI> to desire she would make good the treaty agreed upon be∣twixt her Husband, and him: to submit to that by reason, which otherwise she would be compell'd to doe by force: that she and her Son, would find more ad∣vantage in acquiescing to what had been promised by the late <HI>King,</HI> with mature deliberation, than by drawing the miseries of an obstinate and bloody War upon the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary.</HI> That he was ready to make good his engagements, and use her with a more than ordinary clemency and kindness. The <HI>Queen</HI> answer'd the <HI>Count,</HI> that her <HI>Sex,</HI> her <HI>Age,</HI> and her <HI>Grief,</HI> rendred her uncapable of resolving on an affair of so great importance, with∣out taking the advice of her <HI>Father</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Poland;</HI> that she desired that <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> would allow her some months for these reasons; that the <HI>Emperour Charles,</HI> or himself could not in honour attaque a <HI>Woman</HI> drowned in <HI>Tears,</HI> and an Infant rocked in his <HI>Cradle.</HI> This answer dis∣pleased <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who sent <HI>Leonard Ba∣ron of Velts</HI> with an Army, to compell her to obey. The <HI>Queen</HI> finding her self in this extremity, dispatched some Ambassa∣dors to the <HI>Port.</HI> These were very well
<PB N="102" REF="54"/> received by <HI>Solyman,</HI> and brought thence a Scarlet <HI>Robe</HI> embroidered; an iron <HI>Scep∣ter</HI> with a handle and pomel of Gold, and a <HI>Cymiter,</HI> whose Scabberd was set with precious Stones, as tokens of his amity, and protection. At the same time, the <HI>Sultan</HI> commanded the <HI>Governours</HI> of all the neighbouring places to take the Field without delay to assist that <HI>Queen. Lascus,</HI> who was gone over to serve <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and who at that instant was his <HI>Ambassador</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> demanded the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> of the <HI>Turk,</HI> upon the conditions he had formerly given it to <HI>John Zapoli∣ha.</HI> This demand distasted the <HI>Tyrant,</HI> who put the <HI>Ambassador</HI> into Prison; say∣ing he deserved to die, for daring to scoff and affront his <HI>Highness</HI> in that manner. <HI>Solyman</HI> therefore denying <HI>Ferdinand's</HI> re∣quest, and sending succours to <HI>Queen Eli∣zabeth, Hungary</HI> became the <HI>Theatre</HI> of many and most horrible confusions. The <HI>Germans,</HI> the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Hun∣garians</HI> spilt much blood there: <HI>Rogendorf,</HI> the new <HI>General</HI> of <HI>Ferdinand's</HI> forces, be∣sieged <HI>Buda.</HI> This Siege put <HI>Solyman</HI> in∣to a rage, and on his march to relieve it. However he might have spared his la∣bour, for his forces had raised the Siege before his arrival. And <HI>Rogendorf</HI> ha∣ving
<PB N="103" REF="54"/> lost twenty thousand men there, sa∣ved himself by flight. <HI>Solyman</HI> notwith∣standing pursued his Voyage, and being come near the City, sent some presents to the young <HI>King;</HI> But soon after desi∣ring to make him pay for his visit and charges, he sent to intreat the Queen to let him see her Son, assuring her it was only to oblige his Children to love him the better. At the same time, the De∣puties had order to tell her, that if he did not visit her, it was for fear lest it might stain her Reputation. The <HI>Queen</HI> thanked the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> for his civility and care, and doubting whether she were best to send her Son, or not send him, <HI>George Martinisius</HI> told her, she could not refuse it. Over-come therefore by necessity, she laid him in a <HI>Cradle</HI> worthy of such a <HI>Child;</HI> and having com∣manded the <HI>Nurse,</HI> and some other <HI>Ma∣trons,</HI> together with divers <HI>Hungarian Lords</HI> to attend <HI>him,</HI> she sent him to the <HI>Camp; Solyman</HI> to shew the greater re∣spect and honour, caused them to be re∣ceived by a party of <HI>Horse,</HI> saw the <HI>In∣fant,</HI> and caused it to be caressed by his <HI>Children.</HI> And at the same time, seized upon one of the <HI>Gates</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> whence his Troops got into all the streets and pla∣ces
<PB N="104" REF="55"/> of the Town. That done, he com∣manded the <HI>Burghers</HI> to surrender their Arms, if they would save their lives; which was performed without any dis∣turbance Then <HI>Solyman</HI> sent back the young <HI>Prince</HI> to his <HI>Mother,</HI> and detain'd those <HI>Grandees</HI> who came with him. The <HI>Queen</HI> finding her <HI>City</HI> and her <HI>Officers</HI> under the power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> she weeps, and intreats; But neither her prayers, nor her tears could hinder <HI>Solyman</HI> from consulting whether he should detain the <HI>Kingdom of Hungary,</HI> or restore it to the young <HI>King.</HI></P>

<PB N="105" REF="55"/> <HI>Son-in-law to</HI> Solyman, <HI>gave him more honourable advice, persuading him to keep the</HI> Faith <HI>he was engaged to; it being im∣possible to doe otherwise without staining his Reputation and Credit.</HI> Jahaoglis, Bassa <HI>of</HI> Belgrade, <HI>laying aside all that is humane or decent, endeavour'd to persuade</HI> Solyman <HI>to reduce</HI> Hungary <HI>into a Province, and free himself from the necessity of coming thi∣ther so often, to the relief of a</HI> Woman, <HI>and an</HI> Infant. <HI>He represented to him, that they could never be able to resist the</HI> German <HI>Forces, but by his</HI> Highnesses <HI>help; and by consequence his trouble would be eternal. He said, it ought to be remembred, that within twenty years space,</HI> Solyman <HI>had been forced to come five times into</HI> Hungaria Panonia, <HI>at vast expences, and not without great dan∣ger to his Person; The</HI> first, <HI>to reduce the City of</HI> Belgrade, <HI>which in those days was a meer nest of Thieves. The</HI> second <HI>to re∣venge an affront upon his Ambassadors, to whom he sacrificed</HI> King Lewis; <HI>and then by a prodigality beyond all example, he be∣stowed the</HI> Kingdom <HI>of</HI> Hungary <HI>upon a Person, no way considerable, but for the mis∣chief he had done to the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Forces. The</HI> third, <HI>to succour the same</HI> King <HI>against</HI> Ferdinand <HI>of</HI> Austria, <HI>who molested him, when at the same time he disturbed all</HI> Ger∣many,
<PB N="106" REF="56"/> <HI>by the Siege of</HI> Vienna, <HI>and those incursions, which brought sixty thousand</HI> Christians <HI>into slavery.

Whence he concluded, that since War ought not to be made, but to procure peace and quiet, the</HI> Sultan, <HI>his Master, ought to reduce that Kingdom into a Province, which he had so often gained, and defended; send back the</HI> Queen, <HI>to</HI> Sigismund <HI>her</HI> Father King of Poland; <HI>take the Infant</HI> Prince <HI>along with him to</HI> Constantinople, <HI>to be brought up in the</HI> Mahometan Law: <HI>slay all the</HI> Grandees <HI>of the</HI> Kingdom; <HI>demolish their forts and strong holds; transport part of their Families into</HI> Asia: <HI>and keep the rest in awe and sub∣jection by sufficient Garrisons.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Jahaoglis</HI> said nothing, but what <HI>Solyman</HI> was well able to doe, and which many of his Predecessors would have done upon the like occasion. He resolved however to use greater moderation. He left a Garrison in <HI>Buda,</HI> intreating the <HI>Queen</HI> to allow of what he did, and to retire with her Son to <HI>Lippa,</HI> where she should <HI>Reign</HI> in <HI>Transilvania</HI> bordering upon the <HI>King of Poland,</HI> her <HI>Fathers</HI> Ter∣ritories. And having assured her of the affection he would still have towards her Son, he caused her to be convey'd by some of his own Guards, and gave her Waggons, and Beasts of burthen; that she might conveniently, and without further danger, carry such goods along with her, as were her own. The <HI>Queen</HI> finding the necessity for her departure, endeavour'd to make them believe, she willingly quitted that place, she could not hold. Some of her <HI>Grandees</HI> followed her with much joy, as being deliver'd out of <HI>Prison.</HI> And the <HI>Transilvanians</HI> swore <HI>fealty</HI> to the young <HI>Prince,</HI> by the consent of the <HI>Turk.</HI> And remembring how <HI>King John</HI> had mildly govern'd them

The affairs of the <HI>Hungarians</HI> being in this posture, as we have told you, <HI>King Ferdinand,</HI> who stood in fear of <HI>Solyman,</HI> would needs endeavour to appease him; and to that purpose sent him some presents, worthy both of him that gave them, and he who was to re∣ceive them.

During these occur∣rences <HI>Castaldo</HI> arrived at <HI>Claudiopolis,</HI> called by the <HI>Hungarians Colesvar,</HI> and the <HI>Germans Clausemburgh;</HI> whence fol∣lowing his instructions, he desired <HI>Mar∣tinisius</HI> to make good what he had promi∣sed to the <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Then that <HI>Prelate,</HI> knowing the Queen stood in fear of him, went to her, told her her faults, and exhorted her to make some agreement with <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> to which she consented. To this purpose the <HI>Estates</HI> were convocated at <HI>Claudiopolis:</HI> Where
<PB N="113" REF="59"/> <HI>Castaldo</HI> produced the <HI>Commission</HI> he had to treat with the <HI>Queen;</HI> he shewed them how the <HI>Queen</HI> and her Son, were una∣ble to defend <HI>Transilvania</HI> against the <HI>Turk,</HI> and that for the greater benefit of <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI> it would be very necessary they should make it over to <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> And that both she and her Son might be com∣pensated. He promised to <HI>John Sigismund</HI> the <HI>Dutchies</HI> of <HI>Opelen,</HI> and <HI>Ratibor,</HI> which yielded five and twenty thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> yearly; that he should have in Marriage with the <HI>Princess Jane,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> a hundred thousand Crowns for a portion; and the <HI>Queen</HI> his Mother should receive for her own use fifty thou∣sand Crowns, together with the payment of all her debts.</P>

<P>Methinks, that in consideration of all <HI>Transilvania,</HI> this compensation is but small. Yet when we weigh the advan∣tage, of being deliver'd from the necessity of maintaining a War against the <HI>Turk,</HI> or against the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> then it appears great. And besides the <HI>Queens Sex,</HI> and the <HI>Infancy</HI> of her Son made them uncapable thereof: But did the Queen accept of these proffers?</P>

<P>This courageous and prudent <HI>Prin∣cess,</HI> desiring to throw off the yoke which <HI>Martinisius</HI> was putting on her Neck, acquiesc'd in the <HI>King</HI>'s desires, and im∣mediately deposited the <HI>Regal Ornaments</HI> into the hands of <HI>Castaldo.</HI> That done, she intreated the <HI>Spanish Don,</HI> to prevail so far with his <HI>Master</HI> that what had been promis'd her, might be forthwith accomplished; and retired to <HI>Cassovia,</HI> which was allotted for her retreat, until the whole treaty were fully executed. <HI>Castaldo,</HI> having the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> believed they ought to own his <HI>Master</HI> for <HI>King:</HI> And for that reason, he desired the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Transilvania</HI> to take the Oaths of Fidelity to <HI>King Ferdinand.</HI> They did so without any more dispute, after <HI>George Martinisius</HI> had led the way, who by this <HI>Treaty</HI> had gotten the <HI>Arch∣bishoprick</HI> of <HI>Strigonia,</HI> and a <HI>Cardinals Cap,</HI> which were procured him by the said <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Things being in this posture, each prepared themselves fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> War: The <HI>Hungarians</HI> knew full well, the <HI>Turk</HI> would never without a resent∣ment suffer a Province which owned him for <HI>Sovereign,</HI> to pass into other hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without his leave.

<PB N="115" REF="60"/> affairs so long as <HI>Martinisius</HI> lived, or that the <HI>Queen</HI> had hopes they would make good the agreement that had been made with her. As to what concerns <HI>Marti∣nisius,</HI> you must observe, that desiring to serve the <HI>Christians,</HI> without too much exasperating the <HI>Turk</HI> against him, he saved <HI>Ulambey</HI> whom they could have cut in pieces upon the surrender of <HI>Lippa:</HI> and received into his <HI>Castle</HI> of <HI>Vivaria</HI> the person that gather'd the Tribute which the <HI>Transilvanians</HI> paid to <HI>Solyman.</HI> These actions cost him his life; For <HI>Castaldo</HI> mistrusting him, caused him to be stabb'd by <HI>Mark Antonio Ferrero</HI> his <HI>Secretary,</HI> who by reason of his employment had constant access to him. <HI>Solyman</HI> being informed of the death of <HI>Martinisius,</HI> and the Oath the <HI>Transilvanians</HI> had made to <HI>King Ferdinand,</HI> commanded <HI>Stephen Prince</HI> of <HI>Moldavia, Governour</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> and the neighbouring Countries there∣abouts, to take up Arms and attack them. This command was no sooner given by the <HI>Port,</HI> but they felt the effects. And <HI>Transilvania</HI> had reason to say, that the death of a <HI>Tyrant</HI> had not deliver'd them from slavery. In the mean while <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> not being able to obtain the effect of what had been promis'd her,
<PB N="116" REF="61"/> did again beseech the <HI>Sultan</HI> to have pity on her Son. <HI>Solyman</HI> moved either with the tears of the poor Queen, or his own interest, assisted her powerfully, and reduced the <HI>Transilvanians</HI> to the necessity of importuning <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to permit them to treat with the <HI>Turk</HI> in the behalf and favour of <HI>John Sigismund. Ferdinand</HI> consented, though somewhat against his will; and they obtained the same kindness that had been granted to <HI>John Zapoliha,</HI> his Father; upon the sub∣mission, acknowledgment and tribute <HI>Soly∣man</HI> should impose. This happen'd in the year 1551. The <HI>Queen</HI> having re-entred upon her Estate, <HI>Sigismund Augustus King of Poland</HI> her Brother, was the Media∣tour in another Treaty between <HI>King Ferdinand</HI> and her. By this Treaty, the <HI>Queen</HI> obtained more advantageous con∣ditions than before.

<P>I know great <HI>Princes</HI> do very un∣willingly resign what they have once acquired, nevertheless it is certain that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> did make the surrender I have told you of, and allowed <HI>John Sigismund</HI> to doe whatever he pleased in <HI>Transilva∣nia,</HI> excepting the assuming the title of a <HI>King:</HI> They went farther yet, and that <HI>Transilvanian</HI> supported by the <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces, demanded that the <HI>Danube</HI> might divide the <HI>Estate</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> from that of <HI>Transilvania;</HI> and that upon default of Males in the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> his descen∣dents might succeed in the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary.</HI> This demand vexed <HI>Ferdi∣nand,</HI> who took up Arms, and forced the <HI>Transilvanian</HI> to let the <HI>Tibiscus</HI> limit his Territory. This agreement displeased <HI>John Sigismund,</HI> (or the <HI>Turk,</HI> who made him stickle, as not being able to do it him∣self, by reason of a truce he had made for eight years.) Wherefore the <HI>Transilva∣nian</HI> declared War against the <HI>Emperour Maximilian</HI> I. who lately succeeded <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="62"/> his Father: took from him <HI>Zach∣war, Hudad</HI> and <HI>Corazo;</HI> and had taken <HI>Cassovia,</HI> had not the severity of the season hindred him. However these Voctories lasted not long, for <HI>Maximilian</HI> finding himself wronged, caused him to be assaulted briskly, recovered what he had gained, and forced him to a Peace. But <HI>Solyman</HI> being returned from <HI>Malta,</HI> where he miscarried in his affairs, renew∣ed the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where he died, having besieged <HI>Zigeth,</HI> which surrendred to the <HI>Bassa Mustapha,</HI> his Lieutenant <HI>General,</HI> the 7th. of <HI>September</HI> 1566. <HI>Selim,</HI> who succeeded his Father, agreed upon a truce for eight years with the <HI>Hunga∣rians,</HI> and included the <HI>Transilvanian,</HI> who upon the recommendation of <HI>Sigis∣mund Augustus King of Poland</HI> his Uncle, added to his demeasn some Lands which the <HI>Emperour</HI> yielded to him, and the City of <HI>Guyla,</HI> which he bought of the <HI>Turk, Anno</HI> 1568. The <HI>Transilvanian</HI> then finding that the War was advanta∣geous to him, endeavour'd to corrupt divers <HI>Hungarians,</HI> that he might carry his Arms into <HI>Hungary</HI> with success. This design however had not its effect, for he died in the year 1570. being not yet three and thirty years of Age, and in
<PB N="119" REF="62"/> him was extinguished the race of <HI>Zapoliha.</HI> He had taken care to make choice of <HI>Gas∣per Bekez,</HI> for his Successor: But he was rejected by the <HI>Grandees</HI> of the Country, who put <HI>Stephen Battory</HI> into his place the 24th. of <HI>May</HI> 1571. This <HI>Prince</HI> owned the <HI>Turk,</HI> as his <HI>Predecessor</HI> had done; and having been elected <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> after the retreat of <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> he made it appear that Fortune and Vertue are not incompatible. This man in a short compass of time was first a <HI>Baron,</HI> then a <HI>Prince,</HI> and now a <HI>King,</HI> and most of all these degrees: <HI>Stephen</HI> being thus elected <HI>King of Poland,</HI> gave up <HI>Transil∣vania</HI> to <HI>Christopher Battory</HI> his Brother, who not having the favour of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> because his Brother had been preferred before <HI>Maximilian</HI> II. he was constrained to seek for support at <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI> This <HI>Prince</HI> was very vertuous, and having quell'd the bold <HI>Bekez,</HI> who oft-times endeavour'd to supplant him; he reigned gloriously to his death, which laid him in the grave, <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI> his Son, succeeded him, being yet a Child. And King <HI>Stephen Battory,</HI> his Uncle, having allotted him three <HI>Tutors,</HI> it bred such a jealousie betwixt them, that he was forced to set them all aside,
<PB N="120" REF="63"/> and put both the Person and Affairs of his <HI>Nephew</HI> into the hands and trust of <HI>John Geczy Governour of Varadin.</HI> This was a man of great worth, who soon gave sufficient proof that he had as much courage, as conduct: Scarce had he taken in hand the management of his <HI>Pupil</HI>'s affairs, when <HI>King Stephen</HI> died, <HI>Anno</HI> 1586. Then the factions that arose in <HI>Poland</HI> about the election of a <HI>King,</HI> gave him opportunity to make his worth appear. He joyned his forces with those of <HI>Samoisky,</HI> who favoured <HI>Sigismund</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> against <HI>Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> his Competitor; who was beaten, taken, and compell'd to quit his pretensions to the <HI>Swede.</HI> At the same time, the <HI>Turk</HI> made a rude <HI>War</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> against the <HI>Emperour Rodolphus</HI> II. And though his <HI>Majesty</HI> had brave <HI>Officers,</HI> who made the <HI>Sultan</HI> purchase the <HI>Victories</HI> he obtained very dearly: yet in <HI>Anno</HI> 1595. <HI>Sinan Lieu∣tenant General</HI> for <HI>Selim,</HI> reduced the ad∣mirable fortress of <HI>Javarin</HI> to obedience, which had till then been esteemed im∣pregnable.</P>

<P>The <HI>Emperour</HI> had too much cou∣rage to ask for <HI>Peace,</HI> upon such a loss. He knew that could not but be very disadvantageous, and for that very rea∣son, he was resolved to carry on the <HI>War.</HI> To this end, he desired assistance of every one that was able to afford it; and drew <HI>Sigismund Battory, Prince of Tran∣silvania,</HI> to his party. This <HI>Lord</HI> suffer'd himself easily to be engaged in this noble design, because he had courage, and be∣cause he thought it scandalous in a <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> to favour those that aimed only at the utter destruction of <HI>Christianity.</HI> He made an agreement, therefore with the <HI>Emperour,</HI> the chief <HI>Articles</HI> whereof were; <HI>That</HI> Sigismund <HI>taking up Arms against the</HI> Turk, <HI>the Emperour should be obliged not to make any peace, but by the joynt consent of the</HI> Transilvanian; <HI>and if it came to that, the Principalities of</HI> Vala∣chia, Moldavia <HI>and</HI> Transilvania, <HI>should be comprehended; that he should enjoy the title, the honour and the prerogative of a Prince of the Empire; that they should as∣sign him an honourable rank amongst them;
<PB N="122" REF="64"/> that the Emperour should bestow a Princess of the House and Blood of</HI> Austria <HI>upon him; so long as the present War should last, he should annually furnish him with an hundred thousand</HI> Florins <HI>of the Rhine, which are worth four hundred thousand</HI> French <HI>Livers, and should maintain a good body of</HI> German <HI>Horse and Foot for him; that all such places as he could gain by the Sword should remain in propriety to him and his Heirs of both Sexes: That if by misfortune the</HI> Turk <HI>should happen to drive him out of</HI> Transilvania, <HI>The Em∣perour should give him Lands in the Empire, sufficient to maintain him like a Prince; That there should be a general Amnesty for himself, and for all those that had served him in favour of the</HI> Turk <HI>against his im∣perial Majesty; That he should re-enter upon all those Lands he had before in</HI> Illyria <HI>and in</HI> Hungary; <HI>that the Emperour should pro∣vide him with Artillery, Powder and Am∣munitions for War: And that on his part, he should take the field with fourscore thou∣sand Combatants,</HI> Transilvanians, Vala∣chians <HI>and</HI> Moldavians. This agreement was sealed, by the Marriage of <HI>Sigismund,</HI> with <HI>Maria Christina,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Charles Archduke</HI> of <HI>Gretz;</HI> by the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> sent him from <HI>Philip</HI> II. <HI>King of Spain;</HI> by the <HI>consecrated Hat</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="64"/> and <HI>Sword,</HI> presented him by <HI>Pope Clement</HI> VIII. and by huge <HI>Summs</HI> of <HI>Money</HI> granted and raised for him in several parts of <HI>Christendom.</HI> This League was pleasing to many great <HI>Potentates,</HI> and so distastfull to <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>House of Sigismund,</HI> and to the grea∣ter part of the inhabitants of <HI>Transilva∣nia,</HI> that it was soon followed with inva∣sions, commotions and blood-shed. Then the <HI>Transilvanian</HI> took near his person the <HI>Siculae,</HI> who were very affectionate towards him; and studying a most hor∣rible revenge against his <HI>Kindred,</HI> and the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> convocated the <HI>Estates</HI> at <HI>Claudiopolis.</HI> There it was that <HI>Sigismund</HI> put to death <HI>Balthasar Battory</HI> his Uncle, and divers other Lords of the Country, whom he declared guil∣ty of Treason, and amongst the rest, <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Andreas Battory,</HI> his Cousins, the <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>Balthasar.</HI> At the same time <HI>Sigismund</HI> believing he had suppress'd and stifled the rebellion, caused his League with the <HI>Emperour,</HI> against the <HI>Ottomans</HI> to be proclaimed thorough all his Terri∣tories; and exhorted his Subjects to take up Arms to free themselves from the tyranny they had so long endured. In few days afterwards, he had fifty thou∣sand
<PB N="124" REF="65"/> men on foot, and having put them under good Officers, caused them to ad∣vance towards the <HI>Danube</HI> to begin the <HI>Dance.</HI> And now, indeed, being in the Field, fortune sided with him, and kind∣ly gave him opportunity to take seven <HI>Ships,</HI> laden with money, and other rich goods, which <HI>Sinan</HI> would have employ'd for the corrupting of the Officers of <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> that he might betray it to his <HI>Ma∣ster.</HI> This prize and victory made <HI>Si∣gismund</HI> hope he should be able to be∣siege and take <HI>Themisvar:</HI> but scarce had he attack'd it, when news came the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> ravaged his Countrey; so that he was forced to go back and defend it: The <HI>Siege</HI> being raised, he marches towards those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and finding them in a place that was inaccessible, where valour would have proved but useless, he betook himself to craft; and having set fire to their quarters, he forced them to come out, and utterly defeated them without much trouble or loss.</P>

<P>I am fair and softly drawing on to∣wards what you desire to know. The <HI>Valachians</HI> and <HI>Moldavians</HI> admiring the <HI>Victories</HI> of the <HI>Transilvanians,</HI> would needs have their share, and therefore joyned with them. <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> finding his losses caused this revolt, desi∣red to prevent the like; and to that pur∣pose, commanded the <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Themisvar,</HI> to attack those Rebels, and to make them feel the severity of fire and sword. The <HI>Bassa</HI> willing to obey this order, went into the field: but was defeated about the latter end of the year 1564. This <HI>Victory</HI> of <HI>Sigismund</HI>'s, was soon follow'd by another over above twenty thousand <HI>Tartars,</HI> who returning homewards, laden with booty, were set upon, and defea∣ted by the said <HI>Sigismund:</HI> About the same time died <HI>Amurath</HI> II. and had for Successour <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third his Son, who was then aged about thirty years. <HI>Mahomet</HI> being come to the <HI>Crown,</HI> be∣stowed great largesses upon his <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and made great preparations for a War against the <HI>Christians.</HI> Having therefore
<PB N="126" REF="66"/> had information, that the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and the <HI>Podolians</HI> were entred into the <HI>League</HI> with the <HI>Transilvanians,</HI> he sent an Army of an hundred thousand men, under the conduct of <HI>Sinan,</HI> whom he commanded to chastize these rebels exemplarily. <HI>Si∣nan</HI> prepared himself to execute the commands he had from his <HI>Master;</HI> and whilst he was endeavouring to gain some Friends in <HI>Moldavia,</HI> he likewise raised a formidable Army to compleat his design. For all this, he was but roughly handled by <HI>Sigismund,</HI> who follow'd him so close at his heels, when he thought to repass the <HI>Danube,</HI> that the Bridge being over∣charged with the numerous Crowds of such as fled, broke down; and <HI>Sinan</HI> fal∣ling into the River, was in great danger of keeping company with an infinite num∣ber of his Men, who were then drowned. This action, added to divers others, wherein the good fortune, prudence, and valour of <HI>Sigismund</HI> had been manifested with great splendour, gained him the name of <HI>Invincible,</HI> and forced <HI>Mahomet</HI> to take the conduct of the Army upon himself. Now does he take the field with two hundred thousand fighting men; and these dreadfull forces gave him the confidence to advance as far as <HI>Agria.</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="66"/> There it was that the <HI>Arch-Duke Maxi∣milian,</HI> and <HI>Prince Sigismund</HI> despising his great numbers, out of a custome of bea∣ting them, gave him a Battel, which might have restored the whole affairs of <HI>Christendom,</HI> had not the infamous, and insatiable desire of <HI>booty,</HI> put a stop to their farther victory and pursute. Ours lost about twenty thousand men, and the <HI>Turks</HI> many more. But, from that time, it seemed, <HI>Fortune</HI> who till then had been favourable to the <HI>Transilvanian,</HI> now tur∣ned her back. That <HI>Prince</HI> forgetting his former <HI>Valour,</HI> resolved to exchange <HI>Tran∣silvania</HI> for some Lands in <HI>Silesia:</HI> and to attain those ends, he raised all the force he could, to make his utmost effort. He besieged <HI>Themisvar,</HI> and was constrain'd to raise the same, as at the first time. Some while after, the <HI>Bassa Ibrahim</HI> be∣sieged <HI>Varadin:</HI> And <HI>Basta</HI> having intrea∣ted our <HI>Sigismund</HI> to joyn his forces with those he commanded, to relieve the place, he promis'd it, but broke his word. Since that time, nothing appeared in him but irresolution, and inconstancy. He cau∣sed his <HI>Cousin,</HI> the <HI>Cardinal Battory,</HI> to be proclaimed <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Transilvania:</HI> and not being able to maintain it; he resigned his <HI>Estate</HI> to the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus</HI> II.
<PB N="128" REF="67"/> who gave him <HI>Ratibor,</HI> and <HI>Opelen,</HI> to hold for his life, with a pension of fifty thousand Crowns, and a <HI>Cardinals Cap,</HI> which the <HI>Emperour</HI> was to procure for him.</P>

<P>I told you before, that <HI>Sigismund Battory, Prince</HI> of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> had marri∣ed <HI>Maria Christina</HI> of <HI>Austria:</HI> But being as sluggish in the <HI>War</HI> of <HI>Venus,</HI> as he was brave and active in the field of <HI>Mars,</HI> he owned his impotence; and his marriage was declared <HI>Null.</HI> But I have not yet told you, that after several mischiefs which his departure brought upon the <HI>Estates</HI> of <HI>Transilvania, Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Valachia,</HI> which he had yielded up to the <HI>Emperour;</HI> and after he had repented it, and shewed many tokens of an extreme inconstancy, he died at <HI>Prague</HI> the 17th. of <HI>March</HI> 1603. This death did not con∣firm the possession of <HI>Transilvania</HI> to the <HI>Emperour:</HI> For the <HI>Turk,</HI> having still some partisans in the Country, and the people believing their liberty infringed by the agreement made between the Emperour, and the <HI>Transilvanian,</HI> no body was satisfied with the present condi∣tion
<PB N="129" REF="67"/> of things. <HI>George Basta</HI> the <HI>Empe∣rour's Lieutenant General</HI> in <HI>Transilvania,</HI> tyrannized over the people. The <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the <HI>Polanders,</HI> and others their neighbours had made it the <HI>Theatre</HI> of a long and bloody Tragedy: inso∣much as the <HI>Transilvanians</HI> breathed after nothing but their former condition. In effect, <HI>Stephen Boskay,</HI> having driven away the <HI>Decemviry</HI> the <HI>Emperour</HI> had sent into that Countrey, established him∣self with the good liking of the people, rather by reason of the failures commit∣ted by the <HI>Generals</HI> for the <HI>Emperour Ro∣dolphus,</HI> than by any other interest or power he could make use of: The <HI>Com∣monalty</HI> complained of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> the insolence of strangers, and the extinction of their privileges and immunities <HI>Bos∣kay</HI> fomented these grievances, and im∣proving his credit amongst the people, mightily confirmed himself in the posses∣sion of his <HI>Principality.</HI> From thence it was, that <HI>Gabriel Bethlem,</HI> (to whom the <HI>Turk</HI> had given some hopes of having <HI>Transilvania,</HI>) believing it was not yet a fit time to think of that, submitted wil∣lingly to <HI>Boskay.</HI> In the mean while, the same <HI>Bethlem,</HI> being joyned with <HI>Bechtes Bassa</HI> of <HI>Themisvar,</HI> endeavour'd to sur∣prize
<PB N="130" REF="68"/> <HI>Lippa,</HI> and was surprized himself: So that he was forced to fly in his Shirt, his fear making him forget and leave be∣hind him in his pocket the <HI>Treaty</HI> of his <HI>Conspiracy.</HI> This writing falling into the hands of the <HI>Count de Beljoyoso, Governour</HI> of the Countrey, mightily perplexed him, and consulting how to find out some re∣medy, it was judged to be incurable. In ef∣fect, <HI>Boskay,</HI> lost no time, vanquish'd <HI>Bel∣joyoso,</HI> reduced him to extremity, and sei∣zed upon several places. Then having the <HI>Grandees,</HI> the Cities, and the people on his side, he put himself into such a condition, that he could talk magisterially to them; but <HI>fortune,</HI> who takes delight to make her self admired, turned to <HI>Basta</HI>'s side, who having gained some <HI>Victories,</HI> exhorted <HI>Boskay</HI> to quit his <HI>sword,</HI> and bow down his Neck to the <HI>Imperial Yoke. Boskay</HI> who pretended to the <HI>Principality,</HI> re∣plyed, <HI>That if they did not leave him</HI> Transilvania; <HI>if they did not put</HI> Hunga∣rian <HI>Officers into the</HI> Provinces, <HI>and in the</HI> Cities <HI>to Govern them; if they did not re∣move the foreign</HI> Militia <HI>to some other places and if they did not allow him the exercise of his</HI> Religion, <HI>he would rather chuse to pre∣fer War, than Peace. Fortune,</HI> which ma∣ny times favours the bold, took <HI>Boskay</HI>'s
<PB N="131" REF="68"/> part, and made him triumph over all the difficulties he met with in this War. <HI>Basta,</HI> who pressed most upon him, saw all his Victories turned to an entire and utter disobedience: His Soldiers mutined, telling him, he paid them only with words. They fell upon him in his own House, and those very men that were appointed to guard nine and twenty Waggons, laden with Silver, with Cloath and other Stores, plundred them, and escaped some into <HI>Poland,</HI> and others to the Enemies. Thus <HI>Transilvania</HI> being deliver'd from <HI>Basta</HI>'s Army, part of the hundred Cities were taken by <HI>Boskay</HI>'s Friends, and the re∣mainder surrendred without the trouble of a Summons. This progress of <HI>Boskay</HI>'s, forced the <HI>Emperour</HI> to send <HI>Demetrius Nabradi, Bishop of Vesprin,</HI> and <HI>Sigismund Forgas</HI> to treat with him. These deputies soon found, that his prosperity had made him insolent. They received no other Answer, but only, <HI>If they came from the</HI> Grandees <HI>of</HI> Hungary, <HI>they were welcome; but if they were sent by the</HI> Em∣perour, <HI>they might go back again, he being now at that pass, that he could not retreat, nor change his condition.</HI> This language made the <HI>Deputies</HI> understand, that there was nothing for them to doe there; and
<PB N="132" REF="69"/> that <HI>Transilvania</HI> had changed its Master. In effect, the States of the <HI>Province,</HI> be∣ing assembled at <HI>Kerene, Boskay</HI> was con∣firmed in his Usurpation of that <HI>Princi∣pality:</HI> Upon condition, he would allow the <HI>Roman Religion,</HI> the <HI>Lutheran</HI> and the <HI>Swiss</HI> to be practised amongst them. Then <HI>Sigismund Ragotsky</HI> obtained the Government of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> and <HI>Valen∣tine Homonay</HI> was made <HI>General</HI> of the forces of that Countrey. The <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> who had his Eyes open upon all these changes, sent a <HI>Chiaux</HI> to <HI>Boskay,</HI> who on his behalf presented him a <HI>Mace,</HI> a <HI>Cymitar,</HI> and a <HI>Flag,</HI> to confirm him in the possession of his new <HI>Principality.</HI> In acknowledgement of which favour, <HI>Boskay</HI> dispatched <HI>Stephen Corlat,</HI> and <HI>George Kikedy</HI> to the <HI>Port,</HI> to assure the <HI>Turk</HI> of his Fidelity, and to offer him some token of his obedience.</P>

And that time being
<PB N="134" REF="70"/> expired, they were to send ten thousand ducats yearly to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> as a token of their <HI>Vassalage.</HI> These things passing thus in <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Caramania</HI> were cutting out work for the <HI>Sultan.</HI> For which reason he would needs be excused from the obligation of assisting <HI>Boskay;</HI> and permitted him to make an agreement with the <HI>Emperour.</HI> On the other hand, his <HI>Majesty</HI> being ti∣red with so long a <HI>War,</HI> and persuading himself that <HI>Boskay</HI> having no Children, there would quickly be some new Revo∣lution in that State, he soon consented to whatever was propounded. The chief Articles of this <HI>Peace</HI> were, <HI>That there should be an Amnesty on both sides; that the</HI> Roman Religion, <HI>the</HI> Ausburgh, <HI>and the</HI> Swiss <HI>should be tolerated thorow all</HI> Hunga∣ry; <HI>that the</HI> Palatine <HI>should be elected by votes; that the Governments of all places should be given to</HI> Hungarians, <HI>excepting</HI> Comora <HI>and</HI> Javarin, <HI>which might be given to</HI> Germans. <HI>All</HI> Transilvania, <HI>with that part of</HI> Hungary <HI>that had belonged to</HI> Si∣gismund Battory, <HI>should be resigned to</HI> Bos∣kay, <HI>and that there should be added to them</HI> Zatmar, Vgoe, Tockai <HI>and</HI> Bereg; <HI>that they should endeavour to make a Peace with the</HI> Turk; <HI>and if they could not obtain it,</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="70"/> Boskay <HI>should joyn his Forces with the Em∣perour</HI>'s. This <HI>Treaty</HI> was approved and sworn, by the principal Lords of <HI>Hungary, Bohemia, Austria, Silesia, Moravia</HI> and <HI>Lusatia.</HI> Many of them signed it, and there was only <HI>Melchior Clesel,</HI> then <HI>Bi∣shop</HI> of <HI>Neustadt,</HI> and since <HI>Cardinal,</HI> who made some difficulty, because, said he, they ought not to assist <HI>Hereticks:</HI> but at length he consented. This <HI>Peace</HI> was succeeded by a <HI>Truce</HI> of twenty years, which the <HI>Emperour</HI> made with the <HI>Turk. By this agreement, the</HI> Sultan <HI>obliged him∣self to call the</HI> Emperour Father, <HI>and the</HI> Emperour <HI>was to give the</HI> Sultan <HI>the Title of</HI> Son. <HI>They were both to bear the name of Emperour; the Controversies that might possibly arise between them, were to be deter∣mined by the</HI> Governours <HI>of</HI> Javarin, <HI>and</HI> Buda. <HI>The</HI> Forts <HI>were to remain in the same condition they were in at that time, and neither was to erect any new one. The</HI> Em∣perour <HI>gave the</HI> Turk <HI>two hundred thousand Crowns for once, and after that, they were every three years to bestow mutual presents on each other by their</HI> Ambassadors; <HI>that their amity might remain the more firm.</HI> These Transactions were made, 1606. and followed with the sickness and death of <HI>Boskay,</HI> who for his Successour in the

<P>There is no less honour in refusing a <HI>Crown,</HI> than in striving to deserve one. And I must confess, did I not know that he rejected it really out of contempt, I should have believed it had been out of fear. The <HI>Emperour Rodolphus</HI> II. had some repugnance, for the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Con∣science</HI> he had granted. And the promi∣ses of the <HI>Persian Ambassadors,</HI> together with the Rebellion of <HI>Gambolah,</HI> who had drawn over to his party <HI>Aleppo, Da∣mascus</HI> and <HI>Tripoly,</HI> fomented his irresolu∣tions. This was it that gave occasion to the <HI>Heyducks</HI> to continue their violences, and the <HI>Archduke Matthias</HI> to take up Arms to repress their audacious attempts.
<PB N="137" REF="71"/> That <HI>Prince</HI> having his Sword in hand, pursued his point, and obliged the <HI>Empe∣rour Rodolphus</HI> his Brother, to give him <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Austria.</HI> Then did <HI>Matthi∣as,</HI> less scrupulous than the <HI>Emperour,</HI> sign the <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Transaction</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> adding there the expulsion of the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> and received the <HI>Homage Ragotsky</HI> did him for his <HI>Principality.</HI> Soon after it was clearly seen, that <HI>Ragotsky</HI> despised worldly greatness; For being peaceable possessor of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> equally cherish∣ed by <HI>Matthias</HI> and the <HI>Turk,</HI> he trans∣fer'd his dignity to <HI>Gabriel Battory,</HI> having not Reigned above one year. <HI>Achmet,</HI> the <HI>Emperour</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> confirmed this choice, and the <HI>King Matthias</HI> opposed it not. <HI>Battory</HI> was not so moderate as <HI>Ragotsky</HI> had thought him to be. He became insupportable for his <HI>Letchery,</HI> and the honour of the most vertuous <HI>Matrons</HI> being no way secure under the Domi∣nion of a <HI>Prince</HI> so horribly debauched, they conspired against his life, and he was assassinated at <HI>Valeneza</HI> Anno 1616. <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> who had greatly contri∣buted to this Murther, seized on the <HI>Estate</HI> of the defunct. And to appease <HI>Matthias,</HI> who was then become <HI>Emperour,</HI> and the <HI>Turk Achmet</HI> who were equally

<P>This <HI>Transilvanian</HI> endeavour'd all his life-time to fish in troubled Waters. But the fortune of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the <HI>Emperour,</HI> having the ascendent over his, he was forced in the end to buckle. Let us now see what hapned in those parts, during the <HI>Reign</HI> of <HI>Ferdinand II.</HI> This <HI>Archduke</HI> was the most zealous <HI>Catholick</HI> in the World, and one that could the least of any man suffer the Religions, which his Predecessors had connived at in their Countries. This zeal, and his good fortune, made the <HI>Emperour Matthias,</HI> his Cousin, prefer him, before all the other <HI>Princes</HI> of his <HI>House;</HI> and who designing he should be <HI>Emperour,</HI> after his death, caused him to be owned <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> before his decease. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> began his Reign, with the oppression of the <HI>Protestants:</HI> He commanded some of their <HI>Churches</HI> to be shut up, and demolished some others in <HI>Bohemia.</HI> He recalled the <HI>Jesuits</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and rejected those <HI>Articles</HI> that favour'd the <HI>Religionaries,</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="72"/> in the <HI>Treaties</HI> made between the <HI>Empe∣rours</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Bohemians.</HI> This proceeding having displeased a Body, which at that time was formidable, gave the <HI>Bohemians</HI> occasion to prefer <HI>Frederick Elector Palatine,</HI> before <HI>Ferdinand:</HI> And immediately he beheld the <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> before the walls of his <HI>Capital</HI> City. At the same time, <HI>Gabor,</HI> armed with the pretence of his <HI>Religion,</HI> entred into the <HI>League,</HI> and rai∣sed an Army of eighteen thousand men, strengthned with eighteen pieces of <HI>Can∣non,</HI> wherewith he entred into <HI>Hungary;</HI> and finding their spirits inclined to a Re∣bellion, he made so great a progress, as gave him the confidence to be proclaimed <HI>King.</HI> During these transactions, <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI> was at <HI>Francfort,</HI> where he was elected Emperour. And this <HI>election</HI> ha∣ving given him both authority and forces, he now thought only how to recover the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> he had newly lost, and to hum∣ble those that had dared to attaque him. He loudly complained of the injustice of his adversaries, and having remonstrated to the <HI>Electors</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> the just reasons he had to regain his own, he drew into his party all the <HI>Catholicks</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> and even the
<PB N="140" REF="73"/> <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who had been one of the main Pillars of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> and held the swords of Foreigners within their Scab∣berds. Soon after, the <HI>Elector Palatine,</HI> who had taken the Field with very consi∣derable Forces, was put to flight. <HI>Gabor,</HI> made a stouter resistance, and had brought the <HI>Emperours</HI> affairs to an ill condition, had his associates plaid their part as well at <HI>Prague. Count Dampier, General</HI> of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Forces, lost his life in going to view the <HI>Castle</HI> of <HI>Presburg,</HI> where <HI>Gabor</HI> had a Garrison. And <HI>Charles de Longve∣val, Count Bucquoy,</HI> who after his subdu∣ing of <HI>Moravia,</HI> had made great progress in <HI>Hungary,</HI> died there being pierced with sixteen wounds. The death of this great man, gave opportunity to <HI>Gabor</HI> to reco∣ver many places, to vanquish those that opposed his designs, and range over the whole Countrey. But in fine, seeing his confederates put to flight, and his own Army much weakned, he demanded a <HI>Peace,</HI> and obtained it, Anno 1622. upon these following conditions. <HI>That he should keep all</HI> Transilvania, Tokay, Cassovia, <HI>and seven other</HI> Lordships <HI>in</HI> Hungary; <HI>That resigning with the Crown the other Cities which he held in</HI> Hungary, <HI>he should quit the name of</HI> King, <HI>contenting himself
<PB N="141" REF="73"/> with that of</HI> Prince <HI>of the Empire, and the</HI> Principalities <HI>of</HI> Opelen <HI>and</HI> Ratibor, <HI>and that he should restore the</HI> Jesuits, <HI>where they had been setled before the War.</HI> This <HI>Peace</HI> lasted not long. <HI>Gabor</HI> gave up <HI>Vaccia</HI> to the <HI>Turk,</HI> who sent him fourscore thousand men, which the <HI>Count de la Tour,</HI> had procured for him. With these Troops he invaded <HI>Hungary,</HI> alledging they had not made good to him what was promi∣sed by the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Odimburg;</HI> that they oppressed his <HI>Religion,</HI> and did not deli∣ver the money to him, that was his due. The <HI>Emperour</HI> to prevent this growing mischief, informed the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> that <HI>Gabor</HI> abused his Forces, whilst he at∣taqued him without cause or reason; and adding his Sword to his words, forced his Enemy to an accommodation less advan∣tageous than the former. By this <HI>Treaty made in the year</HI> 1624. Gabor <HI>lost the Title of</HI> Prince <HI>of the</HI> Empire, <HI>and some part of what had been granted him of</HI> Hungary. A while after this restless spirit joyned his Forces with those of <HI>Charles Count Mans∣field.</HI> But forty thousand <HI>Tartars</HI> having been defeated by the <HI>Polanders,</HI> he was forced to quit that design, to goe and take a care of his Countries. And ha∣ving enjoy'd the Company of <HI>Catharine,</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="74"/> the <HI>Daughter</HI> of <HI>John Sigismund Elector of Brandenburg,</HI> but four years, he died in Anno 1628. having endured incredible torment in his Feet. And his death made it evident he equally respected the <HI>Empe∣rour</HI> and the <HI>Turk.</HI> To each of them he left a Horse, the harness set with Jewels, and richly embroider'd, besides forty thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> in <HI>specie.</HI> His <HI>Wife</HI> had of him an hundred thousand pieces of <HI>Gold,</HI> of six pound value each, a hundred thousand <HI>Crowns</HI> of Silver, and a hundred thousand <HI>Florins,</HI> with three <HI>Lordships,</HI> which she was to enjoy during life.</P>

<P>When the <HI>Heirs</HI> to <HI>Principalities</HI> are uncertain, the death of the <HI>Prince</HI> is ever attended with trouble. <HI>Catharine,</HI> the Widow of <HI>Gabor</HI> not being capable to Reign, named <HI>Stephen Czac,</HI> to succeed
<PB N="143" REF="74"/> her Husband, and desired the <HI>Turk</HI> to confirm him: This <HI>Election</HI> displeased the <HI>Transilvanians,</HI> who divided their affec∣tions, and some of them made choice of <HI>Stephen Bethlem,</HI> Brother of the late <HI>Prince;</HI> while others would rather have <HI>George Ragotsky.</HI> The first was so unfortunate, that his own Children rose up against him; and the second having overcome his adversaries, complied with the <HI>Empe∣rour,</HI> gained the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s favour, and pos∣sessed <HI>Transilvania</HI> singly. Yet, was not his good fortune constant, <HI>Stephen Beth∣lem,</HI> who had surrendred all his pretensi∣ons to him, killed one of his Relations; and fearing the just punishment which he deserv'd, endeavour'd to avoid it by a bigger Crime. He craved assistance of the <HI>Port,</HI> who sent him an Army of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> with whom he besieged <HI>Gy∣ula. Ragotsky</HI> abhorring the infidelity of the <HI>Turk,</HI> submitted himself to the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> and received from thence three <HI>Regiments</HI> of Foot, and one of Horse, to re-inforce his Army, with the which he destroy'd five and twenty thousand <HI>Turks</HI> neer <HI>Szabuta.</HI> In fine, <HI>Bethlem,</HI> retur∣ning to his duty, was received into fa∣vour, and the <HI>Sultan</HI> confirmed <HI>Ragotsky</HI> in his <HI>Principality:</HI> During these occurren∣ces,
<PB N="144" REF="75"/> the <HI>Emperour Ferdinand II.</HI> died, lea∣ving for <HI>Successour</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> and all his <HI>Estates, Ferdinand III.</HI> his <HI>Son.</HI> This <HI>Prince,</HI> who had a very dangerous War cut out for him in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> desired to preserve the <HI>Peace</HI> in <HI>Hungary;</HI> It was, notwithstanding bro∣ken, by the advice of such, as persuaded him that he ought to forbid the <HI>Lutherans</HI> to frequent a <HI>Church,</HI> they had at <HI>Pres∣burgh;</HI> and to revoke whatever had been promised in their favour. This policy appeared but very ill to such as know, that even good acts do loose of their va∣lue, when done out of season. There is nothing that shocks men so much, as a violence against their <HI>Consciences,</HI> and there are few things wherein we ought to have a greater circumspection, than when we go about to reform Religion. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> of <HI>Presburgh,</HI> not being a∣ble to suffer the loss of their <HI>Church,</HI> nor to preserve it without the assistance of <HI>Strangers,</HI> called <HI>Ragotsky</HI> to their <HI>Aid.</HI> This man fearing to put to Sea without <HI>Bisquit,</HI> and enter upon a <HI>War,</HI> wherein he should have but little succour from the <HI>Turk,</HI> who was employ'd in <HI>Asia;</HI> desi∣red the <HI>Emperour</HI> and his <HI>Council,</HI> that they would vouchsafe to make good their
<PB N="145" REF="75"/> promise to the <HI>Hungarians.</HI> The <HI>Empe∣rour</HI> despising both the intercession and the Forces of <HI>Ragotsky,</HI> would give him no satisfaction. That <HI>Prince</HI> then believing himself to be more obliged to his Sect, than to his Friend and <HI>Benefactor,</HI> suffer'd himself to be over-persuaded by the <HI>Con∣federates Ambassadors,</HI> who sought his <HI>Al∣liance;</HI> and having declared War against the <HI>Emperour,</HI> he entred <HI>Hungary</HI> with an Army of seventy thousand fighting men. And that it might appear he did not be∣gin the War without good reason; he by a <HI>Manifesto</HI> set forth, that since the year 1619. they placed <HI>Hungary</HI> amongst the <HI>Hereditary Provinces</HI> belonging to the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> that they bestowed up∣on the <HI>Clergy,</HI> those employments that appertained to the <HI>Laity,</HI> that they kept the <HI>Protestants</HI> out of all Offices; that they would not hear their complaints and grievances, and that against their Wills, and without any thing of their consent or allowance, they had intro∣duced the <HI>Jesuits</HI> into that Countrey. The first expedition of <HI>Ragotsky,</HI> was to ravage the Lands of <HI>George Homonay;</HI> af∣ter which he subdued all that opposed him even to <HI>Cassovia.</HI> The <HI>Emperour</HI> to put some stop to this torrent, opposed him
<PB N="146" REF="76"/> with eight and twenty thousand men, under the conduct of the <HI>Count de Boucha∣im,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Hungary;</HI> but not having been able to regain <HI>Cassovia,</HI> he most readily hearkned to a proposition for Peace. By the agreement they yiel∣ded to <HI>Ragotsky</HI> seven <HI>Lordships</HI> in <HI>Hunga∣ry;</HI> in his favour they set open ninety <HI>Churches,</HI> wherein the <HI>Protestants</HI> might publickly teach their <HI>Doctrine;</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were restored to their privi∣leges. This <HI>Treaty,</HI> seemed disadvanta∣geous to the <HI>Catholicks;</HI> but the <HI>Suedes</HI> felt the much greater inconvenience; for the <HI>Emperour</HI> having pluck'd this Thorn out of his Foot, relieved <HI>Brin,</HI> and forced <HI>Torstenson</HI> to raise the Siege he had for∣med there. Then <HI>Lewis Count de Souches,</HI> a <HI>French Gentleman,</HI> who had been the chief cause of its preservation, had the Government thereof bestow'd upon him, as a reward for his signal service.</P>

And being able to doe no great wonders, was con∣strained to retire, either with a great deal of shame, or with very little reputation. His misfortune did not however end with the loss of his Army; he was persecuted yet more, his ill fate armed the <HI>Turk</HI> a∣gainst him, and slew him in a Battel, where∣in he lost his life, together with that Countrey he might have left to his Son. Some have written that the <HI>Christians</HI> ex∣cited the <HI>Turk</HI> against him, and that was one of the chiefest causes of this present War; <HI>Kemin Janos,</HI> his Lieutenant Ge∣neral, endeavour'd to get into his place, and to attain his ends, he did submit to his <HI>Imperial Majesty,</HI> sought for and obtained his protection. But he could not pre∣serve that Estate, which he had seized
<PB N="148" REF="77"/> on. It was then, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> desiring to maintain <HI>Janos,</HI> without exasperating the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> could effect neither the one, nor the other. <HI>Janos</HI> was lost in a Battel, and the <HI>Turk</HI> was dissatisfied with the <HI>Emperour,</HI> who, (as he said) had infringed the <HI>Truce,</HI> which was between them. This misunderstan∣ding heated both parties, and occasioned several Embassies, and <HI>Negociations</HI> on ei∣ther side. The <HI>Sultan</HI> declared that he intended nothing but to maintain the <HI>Peace;</HI> and his Subjects modestly complained of us, saying that we desired a War, and they would make none, unless they were compell'd to it by necessity. During these wranglings, <HI>Nicholas Count Serini</HI> believed the War was already at our Doors, and imagining it would be some advantage to him, to build a <HI>Fort</HI> upon the Banks of the River <HI>Mur:</HI> he did so, and began some Hostilities. This <HI>Fort</HI> gave the <HI>Turk</HI> greater cause of complaint, who deman∣ded it should be demolished by a <HI>Chiaux,</HI> and by an <HI>Aga,</HI> whom I saw at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the month of <HI>January</HI> one thousand six hundred sixty two. These demands had no favourable answers; but it seemed as if they had talked to deaf man. And, to tell the truth, observing that haughti∣ness,
<PB N="149" REF="77"/> and resolution to give the <HI>Turk</HI> no satisfaction, I concluded that they would have a War; and that the <HI>Fort</HI> of <HI>Serini,</HI> was a place, would make work enough for several <HI>Ottoman</HI> Armies. Yet expe∣rience hath shewed us, that the said <HI>Fort</HI> was worth nothing, and that we had no need to undertake a War of such impor∣tance for it. I shall not lay down the reasons, because any one may easily guess them. It shall suffice I tell you, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> seeing the <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces in <HI>Transilvania,</HI> and fearing to be taken unprovided; they sent the <HI>Counts de Montecuculi,</HI> and <HI>Souches,</HI> into the Field with two small Bodies of men: But a good part of them were destroy'd without gi∣ving a blow, or preventing the loss of <HI>Kemin Janos,</HI> or the establishment of <HI>A∣baffi.</HI> The <HI>Sultan,</HI> therefore seeing that <HI>Transilvania</HI> was in his power, and that <HI>Abaffi</HI> was fast in the Saddle, and obliged to serve him, demanded again with grea∣ter instance, that the <HI>Fort Serini</HI> should be demolished, and reparation made for the injuries, he said, they had done him. For all this, could they not resolve to grant him what he asked: so that with∣out more adoe, he resolved to take his own satisfaction, and try whether his first
<PB N="150" REF="78"/> Warlike enterprize, would prove as hap∣py, as he thought it just. He therefore began that War, which he prosecutes to this day, with much heat, and in which all <HI>Christendom</HI> seems to have a share. I conjure you to consider seriously, what I have told you till this present, and I am confident you may rightly judge of the justice of both parties in this controversie. We must now see, after what manner the <HI>Turk</HI> attaqued us in the year 1661. with what Forces we opposed him, and what either of them hath acted since the beginning of this War; that so you may the better apprehend what we are to fear; and what we may reasonably hope.</P>

<P>It seems to me, that the interest of his <HI>Imperial Majesty</HI> obliged him to chuse rather to demolish the <HI>Fort Serini,</HI> and give satisfaction as the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> de∣manded, than to enter into a <HI>War</HI> against him. For <HI>Hungary</HI> and the <HI>Empire</HI> stood in need of <HI>Peace,</HI> and there was but little probability of wresting <HI>Transilvania</HI> out of the <HI>Turkish</HI> hands, which he had so lately seized upon, with some appearance of <HI>Justice.</HI></P>

<P>If it were reasonable to measure <HI>Counsels,</HI> by the <HI>Events,</HI> we should have just cause to blame that which was given
<PB N="151" REF="78"/> at <HI>Vienna.</HI> But I guess, they did not be∣lieve, that those who had stood so long with their Arms across, when they might have attaqu'd the <HI>Empire</HI> with advantage during the War, had a mind to measure their <HI>Cymitars</HI> with our <HI>Swords,</HI> when we were all in peace. We have notwith∣standing seen the contrary; and <HI>Maho∣met</HI> IV. resolved to begin the War by the rupture he made, after he had dallied with us a while: For to tell you the truth, I do not think but all his <HI>Embassies,</HI> and that great show of moderation, were only to amuse us. The quick sighted judged rightly, that it was necessary to levy men; and the more stupid said, that there was no trusting of such, as have no faith in them. The <HI>Emperour</HI> finding he should have need of assistance, desired some; and the very formalities of giving, and of receiving it, was the cause they were not in a readiness when the business began. The <HI>Confederates</HI> offer'd conside∣rable forces, which they had already on foot; but they would have the command over them; and his Majesty thought, that it would be an affront to his dignity to receive them upon those terms. The <HI>Empire</HI> making the same offers, and the same demands, met with the same diffi∣culties;
<PB N="152" REF="79"/> and from thence it came to pass, that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> being advanced as far as upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> attacked <HI>Neuheusel,</HI> by the <HI>Hungarians</HI> called <HI>Vivar;</HI> defeated three thousand men, who made a sally to surprize him, sent some prisoners to <HI>Constantinople</HI> as tokens of his <HI>Victory,</HI> and at last, forced the garrison to surrender upon composition, and triumphed over that considerable place, which gave him opportunity to make inroads to the very gates of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and harass the <HI>Frontiers</HI> of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>

<P>The Treaty that was concluded at <HI>Munster</HI> upon the 24. of <HI>October</HI> 1648, ha∣ving yielded up some Lands to the <HI>French,</HI> and to the <HI>Suedes,</HI> as likewise to some Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> they all feared that the House of <HI>Austria</HI> would repent
<PB N="153" REF="79"/> the having bought such a Peace: that they would endeavour to recover what had been dismembred from the <HI>Empire;</HI> and that some others would demand what they had lost. To obviate these inconveniences, the <HI>Cardinal Mazarin,</HI> persuaded those that had any cause of fear, and such as desired the peace of the <HI>Em∣pire,</HI> that it were fit they should unite more closely, and engage to defend each other mutually, in case they should hap∣pen to be molested in the possessions of what the Treaty had adjudged to them. Ten or twelve <HI>Princes,</HI> as well <HI>Ecclesia∣sticks</HI> as <HI>Seculars,</HI> and of all <HI>Religions</HI> al∣lowed in the <HI>Empire,</HI> entred into this League. And every one having taxed himself proportionably to his forces, they to this purpose designed to have about five and twenty thousand men, under the conduct of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Salmes,</HI> and of <HI>Count Holach.</HI> The <HI>Emperour,</HI> to whom this thing was highly distastfull, endea∣vour'd to dissolve them, and not being able to compass the same, he endeavour'd to turn it to his own advantage. To this effect, finding he was now threatned with a War by the <HI>Turk,</HI> he remonstra∣ted the approaching danger, and desired those Troops might be employed for the
<PB N="154" REF="80"/> defence of the <HI>Empire.</HI> The <HI>Confederates</HI> consented thereto, upon condition they should be sworn to none but themselves, nor should be employed against any but the common enemy. On the contrary, his <HI>Majesty</HI> desiring they should obey him absolutely, and that they should let him have them without any conditions; the business lingred so long, that they arrived very late in <HI>Hungary.</HI> They were then under the command of <HI>Wolfang Julius</HI> Count of <HI>Hollac,</HI> and made a separate body from the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s, and those be∣longing to the <HI>Empire.</HI> Whence you may judge, that although the greater part of those that composed this <HI>League</HI> were <HI>German Princes,</HI> they were however cen∣sed as somewhat differing from the body of the <HI>Germans;</HI> because several Stran∣gers signed to it, and contributed to their maintenance; or because the two <HI>Kings,</HI> who were parties concerned, had more power than all the rest of the <HI>Confede∣rates</HI> together.</P>

<PB N="155" REF="80"/>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I may answer your question in one entire discourse, you must know, That the <HI>Turk</HI> having resolved to cut us out work, he sent his <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> who arrived at <HI>Belgrade</HI> the 8th of <HI>June.</HI> The <HI>Baron de Gois</HI> Ambassador from his <HI>Imperial Majesty,</HI> came thither the day after; and the eighteenth he was conducted into the presence of the <HI>Vizier.</HI> He had then on his left hand two of his <HI>Brothers,</HI> on his right the <HI>Mufti,</HI> and a∣bout his Person near two hundred <HI>Officers.</HI> In this first audience, the <HI>Baron</HI> having made his Complement to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> he told him, he was come thither to conclude the Treaty that had been begun betwixt him and <HI>Aly Bassa.</HI> They let him know that it was too late, and that they would think further on it when they were upon our <HI>Frontiers.</HI> The <HI>Baron</HI> replied, they were then to blame to make him come thither, that he could not understand why they refused to conclude it, that they should meet with greater difficulties when the War was begun: And that <HI>God</HI> would punish those who should be the cause of shedding innocent blood. The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> answer'd, that he had weighed those reasons very maturely be∣ing at <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and that in case
<PB N="156" REF="81"/> they would then have consented, to what they now offer'd, he should not have undertaken that journey. Neither would he hear any thing of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Themis∣var,</HI> and made great complaints against those that had broken the peace. Upon which the <HI>Baron</HI> said, those things had been urged before, and that they were fully answered. This is what passed at the first audience. To which the <HI>Vizier</HI> added, that the <HI>Baron</HI> might yet send an Express to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and assure the <HI>Empe∣rour,</HI> that if he would lay down that sum of money he would demand, evacuate all the places he yet held in <HI>Transilvania,</HI> that of <HI>Zekelheid</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and raze the <HI>Fort Serini,</HI> there might be some means of making a Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fansie that by this proposition the <HI>Vizier</HI> intended to amuse the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> and that the <HI>Turk</HI> was not advanced into <HI>Hungary,</HI> with an Army of seventy thou∣sand Men, and an hundred and thirty pieces of Cannon, to go back again with∣out striking one blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so too, and do not think that an Officer, how great soever in me∣rit and reputation, durst have taken any resolutions contrary to those his <HI>Master</HI> had prescribed him. The Army there∣fore
<PB N="157" REF="81"/> began to file away upon the 11th of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1663. And this was done with so much pomp, that one would have judged it to consist of two hundred thousand fighting men. The noise of the <HI>Camels,</HI> the <HI>Horses,</HI> and the <HI>Mules,</HI> the ratling of the <HI>Drums</HI> and <HI>Timbals,</HI> and the sound of their <HI>Trumpets,</HI> lasted both day and night till the eighteenth of the same month. The <HI>Officers</HI> moved slowly, and although some or other marched every day, they were most of them <HI>Bassa</HI>'s with their equipage, which being magnificent, made a stately show, and appeared great to admiration. In fine, the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries</HI> parted the fifteenth with four thousand of his companions, and was followed by the rest of the Army till the eighteenth, at which time the <HI>Grand Vi∣zier</HI> went on his way, with a most royal magnificence. He sent a thousand foot before him, with each a led horse or two in their hands. After these marched the <HI>Spahi-Alagarsi,</HI> who is General of those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that serve on horseback, prece∣ded by his great <HI>Standard,</HI> and followed by six hundred <HI>Spahi-Edeli,</HI> who are the most valiant of all <HI>Turky,</HI> having their <HI>Cornets</HI> very prettily adorned. These were followed by a long Staff, at the top
<PB N="158" REF="82"/> whereof was a large brass button, from whence hung down a <HI>Horse-tail.</HI> Soon after were seeen two great <HI>Guidons,</HI> which they carried before the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Brothers, and other Persons of Quality and com∣mand, who were accompanied by seven hundred <HI>Hasvadars,</HI> or Valets, most of them covered with Coats of Mail, from the crown of the head, down to the knees. At last the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Ensigns and Guidons marched, and were immediate∣ly followed by sixteen led Horses, with Saddles and Housins embroider'd with Gold, and Precious Stones. The Grooms that led them, had Cloath of Gold Vests, and Breeches of Crimson Velvet. Eight of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Footmen had the like cloa∣thing, and he went in the midst of these, accompanied by two <HI>Janizaries,</HI> wearing upon his head a <HI>Turban</HI> of great price. After the <HI>Vizier</HI> came the <HI>Rosevendy,</HI> or great <HI>Chancellor;</HI> the <HI>Tesdatir,</HI> or Com∣missary General, and some other of the principal <HI>Officers</HI> of the Army: The <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the <HI>Chamber,</HI> all young Fel∣lows of twenty or thirty years, cover'd with Jacquets: Six hundred <HI>Hasvadars,</HI> forty <HI>Cimbalists</HI> and <HI>Trumpeters;</HI> two hundred ordinary Horse-men, and three∣score Horses, that carried the <HI>Grand Vi∣zier</HI>'s
<PB N="159" REF="82"/> <HI>Tents</HI> and <HI>Pavillions.</HI> With this mag∣nificent and dreadfull train, he arrived at <HI>Bukovar</HI> the four and twentieth; and there he was informed by the <HI>Aga</HI> whom he had sent to the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> that instead of fourscore thousand men he had promised, he would send ten thousand, under the conduct of his Son. The ex∣cuse he made for not keeping his word was, that the white <HI>Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI> had made some incursions into his Countrey, which obliged him to keep his men for the defence of his <HI>Frontiers.</HI> Two days after he got to <HI>Eseck,</HI> where he sojourned eight or ten days, waiting for such as were to joyn him. At last he passed the <HI>Bridge,</HI> which is above twelve thousand paces in length, and arrived at <HI>Buda</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>July.</HI> There it was, that after they had held divers <HI>Councils,</HI> the Siege of <HI>Neuhusel</HI> was resolved, and the seventh of <HI>August</HI> the place was inves∣ted. Three thousand men whom the <HI>Counts Forgats, Palfi,</HI> and the <HI>Marquis Pio,</HI> commanded to surprize the Enemy, fell into their <HI>Nets,</HI> and were massacred, and taken Prisoners. And the place was so closely begirt, that they were forced to capitulate, and surrender upon com∣position the 18. of <HI>September,</HI> in the same year.</P>

<P>The defeating of that great sally, did without doubt, so much weaken the Garrison, as caused the loss of the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is probable they might have held out longer: but there being no relief to be expected, they must in fine, have been compell'd to submit to their Enemies. They endured three assaults, wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> were vigorously repulsed. Howe∣ver the <HI>Count Forgats</HI> their Governour was confin'd, and accused for not having done his duty in that Siege. But I be∣lieve it was more his unhappiness, than his Crime, that lost it: It was reported here, when this strong <HI>Fortress</HI> was taken, that the Officers were young, and with∣out experience. And on the contrary the <HI>Vizier</HI> was a Person about the Age of five and thirty, active, and diligent in his ex∣peditions, skilfull in the Mathematicks, of an heroick courage; and who was day and night in the Trenches, both to en∣courage his Soldiers, and to shew them a brave example. This place being taken, he caused seven pieces of Cannon to be fired in token of <HI>Victory.</HI> And having sent one of his Brothers to the <HI>Port,</HI> to carry the news of it to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> he began to repair the Breaches; and then retired, to prepare himself for the
<PB N="161" REF="83"/> next <HI>Campagne.</HI> This loss awakened the <HI>Empire,</HI> which seemed to have lain asleep, and the Diet having been called at <HI>Ratis∣bon,</HI> some of the <HI>Princes</HI> appeared there in Person, the rest by their <HI>Ambassadors.</HI> There was the magnificence of our <HI>Ger∣many</HI> to be seen: For although the <HI>Em∣perour</HI> had desired the <HI>Potentates</HI> to come without any pomp, yet nothing appeared but what was brave and stately. Divers old <HI>Officers</HI> came to offer their <HI>Swords</HI> to the <HI>Emperour.</HI> And those <HI>Princes</HI> who were no strangers to the smell of <HI>Gun-powder</HI> presented themselves to command the o∣ther. The Number and merit of the pretenders did as much puzzle his Majesty in the liberty of his choice, as the great variety of <HI>Flowers</HI> in Summer does the Ladies in a curious Garden. He must however resolve, and chuse Comman∣ders for the new Bodies they were going to raise. The <HI>Emperour</HI> who had already three Armies under the conduct of the <HI>Counts de Serini, Montecuculi</HI> and <HI>Souches,</HI> desired to make them more capable to undertake somewhat extraordinary. To this end, without changing the inferiour Officers, and leaving the Sovereign com∣mand to these Counts, he joyned with them <HI>Philip Prince Palatine</HI> of the branch
<PB N="162" REF="84"/> of <HI>Sultzbac,</HI> and Count <HI>Spar,</HI> persons of merit and great reputation. The first commanded his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Horse, in qua∣lity of <HI>Captain General,</HI> and the other led the Foot, and the <HI>Cannon. Leopold Willi∣am, Marquiss</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> was <HI>General</HI> in <HI>Chief</HI> of the Army belonging to the <HI>Em∣pire. Count Fugger, Governour</HI> of <HI>Ingolstad,</HI> commanded the <HI>Infantry</HI> under him, and <HI>Ulric Duke of Wirtemberg</HI> was <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Cavalry. John Adolphus Duke of Hol∣stein,</HI> and <HI>Gustavus Adolphus Marquis of Baden</HI> served in the same Army in quality of Mareshals <HI>de</HI> Camp, the one of the <HI>Horse,</HI> the other of the <HI>Foot.</HI> The Army of the Confederates having lost the <HI>Prince of Salmes,</HI> a little before the beginning of this War, they ever afterwards were un∣der <HI>Wolfang Julius Count Holoch,</HI> who had Officers and Soldiers of great importance. <HI>Count Serini</HI> commanded the <HI>Hungarian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Croats,</HI> who were numerous, and the <HI>Count de Souches</HI> had a flying Army, wherewith he scowred the Enemie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countries, and covering our <HI>Frontiers,</HI> often obtained Victories.

<PB N="164" REF="85"/> for a long time had in the Field, and were sufficient to have driven the <HI>Turk</HI> out of <HI>Hungary.</HI> And truly it might have been done, had they all acted by one consent, or had there been a <HI>General</HI> of such a quality, that all the rest of the <HI>Generals</HI> had been obliged to respect him for his birth, and to obey him for his absolute power, and <HI>Command.</HI> If therefore our misfortune would have it so, that we suffer'd some places to be taken; we must lay the blame on the little good Order, and the great Animosities betwixt the several Nations, that made up our Ar∣mies. But to proceed, the <HI>Princes</HI> being at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> when the resolution was ta∣ken to assist his Majesty, each of them promised to doe what he could, in pro∣portion to his incomes and strength.

And these having repulsed the Enemy with considerable loss, they brea∣thed nothing but Battels, and <HI>Victories.</HI> And indeed, these brave men, taking ad∣vantage of the <HI>Turk</HI>'s retreat, over-run a part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> took and plundred <HI>Ra∣boscha, Segues,</HI> and the five <HI>Churches;</HI> burnt the <HI>Bridge</HI> of <HI>Eseck,</HI> which is above twelve thousand paces long, carried a terrour thorough all the Countrey, burnt
<PB N="166" REF="86"/> to ashes all the Corn, Hay and Straw, the Enemy had on the Banks of the River <HI>Drave.</HI> The noise of these <HI>Victories</HI> spread over the whole <HI>Empire,</HI> and giving a re∣putation to those Generals, raised the Courage of their Soldiers, filled their Pockets with money, and furnished them plentifully with those provisions they wanted. These <HI>Noblemen</HI> therefore see∣ing things were disposed towards a Victo∣ry, consider'd by what means to effect it, went to <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> propounded some Mili∣tary exploits, made them understand the <HI>Bridge</HI> of <HI>Eseck</HI> could not be repaired, till the season was very much advanced, and that in the mean time, they might besiege and take <HI>Canisia,</HI> which they held block'd up by the taking of <HI>Buzats, Zigeth,</HI> and the Garrison they kept at <HI>Serinvar.</HI> They demanded things necessary for the Siege of so important a place; and be∣lieving undoubtedly they would send them, it was begun with great applica∣tion and eagerness in the Spring. This <HI>Siege</HI> was bloody, and having weakned the Besiegers, and lasted longer than was expected, the <HI>Enemy</HI> approached, and made them raise the Siege. And be∣fore the <HI>Christian</HI> Forces could be drawn together, they took <HI>Serinvar,</HI> and little
<PB N="167" REF="86"/> <HI>Comorra.</HI> These advantages were fol∣lowed by greater. For although our Armies were now gotten together, they continued their <HI>Victories,</HI> by the taking of <HI>Vesprin.</HI> But good <HI>Fortune,</HI> being at last weary of waiting on the wrong par∣ty, turned to us, and from that time the <HI>Vizier</HI> and his men were less succesfull. <HI>Lewis Count Souches; Governour</HI> of <HI>Comor∣ra,</HI> defeated the Infidels at <HI>Sernevits,</HI> and pursued them so vigorously, that he made them quit <HI>Barcan,</HI> and ruin'd a <HI>Bridge</HI> of <HI>Boats,</HI> they had upon the <HI>Danube. Re∣mond Count de Montecuculi,</HI> made them repent the design they had to pass the River of <HI>Raab,</HI> and the <HI>Counts de Coligny,</HI> and <HI>dela Fueillade,</HI> cut in pieces every man of them that had passed the said Ri∣ver, near <HI>Saint Godards.</HI></P>

<P>It is affirmed indeed, that <HI>Coligny,</HI> and <HI>la Fueillade</HI> did wonders; wherefore I should be huge glad, before this discourse be ended, to hear somewhat more at large of the Succours the Emperour de∣manded of <HI>Foreign Princes;</HI> for I verily believe they were one of the main Strength of our Armies, and the chief motive that obliged the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to encline towards and desire a Peace so soon.</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no doubt of it: For the <HI>Emperour</HI> taking care to fortify himself against that potent Enemy, dispatched <HI>Ambassadors</HI> to implore the assistance of all such as could afford him any. These <HI>Ambassadors</HI> met with good words every where; and in some places with good effects. All <HI>Germany</HI> roused themselves, <HI>Italy, Sweden, Spain, Lorrain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> took the business to <HI>heart,</HI> for the preser∣ving of <HI>Hungary. Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> promi∣sed to furnish great Summs of <HI>Money; Sweden, Lorrain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> offer'd to send them men to be maintained at their own charges. I cannot precisely tell wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the others did: But, it may be truly af∣firmed that the zeal of the <HI>French,</HI> did upon this occasion surpass that of all the other <HI>Christians.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> heard with regret, that the <HI>Turk</HI> had begun the War, and with joy that the <HI>Emperou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> desired he would assist him. The destru∣ction and havock the <HI>Tartars</HI> had mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon our <HI>Frontiers,</HI> and the <HI>Christians</HI> that were daily carried away in chains bred so much compassion, that whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Count Strozzi</HI> limited to four thousan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Foot, and two thousand Horse, the Suc∣cours he demanded in the Name of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Imperial Majesty,</HI> he was sorry he had se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="169" REF="87"/> such narrow bounds to his liberality. He therefore exhorted his <HI>Nobility</HI> to this glorious Enterprize; and said, even to those whom he best loved, that they might make their <HI>Court</HI> with as much advantage to themselves in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as in the <HI>Louvre:</HI> He protested in presence of the Princes, and <HI>Lords</HI> of his <HI>Court,</HI> that if the <HI>Daufin</HI> his Son were but ten years old, he would send him upon that expe∣dition. And which is most worthy to be observed, he assured them, that if God should be pleased to afflict <HI>Christendom</HI> so much, as to suffer the Emperour to be worsted that <HI>Campagne,</HI> he would himself go the next and endeavour to repair the loss, and repulse his Enemy. These dis∣courses did so stir up the <HI>French Nobility,</HI> that several hundreds who preferr'd the satisfaction of their Consciences, and the motions of their generosity to all the pleasures and delights of the Court, made preparation to go against the common Enemy. <HI>Prince Philip, Chevalier de Lor∣rain,</HI> knowing his <HI>Predecessors</HI> had reign∣ed in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> after they had driven out the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and that his <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Count de Harcour,</HI> was grieved his old Age would not admit him to buckle on his Armour, nobly supplied his place, and
<PB N="170" REF="88"/> upon this occasion shewed so many proofs of his courage, that it may justly be said, he made those <HI>Lorrain Princes</HI> live again, who other-while conquer'd the <HI>East,</HI> as also the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Mercoeur,</HI> who in the be∣ginning of this Age was admired for his actions at the retreat of <HI>Canisia,</HI> and the taking of <HI>Alba-Regalis.</HI> The <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Rohan</HI> and <HI>Soubize,</HI> having a thousand Predecessors to imitate, made it appear in this service, that if the <HI>Dukes</HI> whose names they bear, knew how to defend the <HI>Protestants</HI> whilst they lived, they were no less forward to expose their lives for the defence of <HI>Christianity</HI> against the <HI>Infidels.</HI> The <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Brisac,</HI> remem∣bring the reputation of the <HI>Mareschals de Cassé</HI> and <HI>Brisac</HI> his <HI>Ancestors,</HI> spared nei∣ther his body or heart to pursue their race, and gain the Crown of Honour. The <HI>Count de Sault,</HI> and the <HI>Marquisses de Ragny</HI> and <HI>Canaples</HI> demonstrated the ar∣dent desire they had to equal the merit of the <HI>Constable Duke de Lesdiguieres,</HI> the <HI>Mareshals de Crequy,</HI> the <HI>Lords de Pontdor∣my,</HI> and an infinite more of their illustri∣ous <HI>Predecessors,</HI> which pushed and <HI>spurr'd</HI> them on in the way of <HI>Military Vertue.</HI> The <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> and the <HI>Count d' Auvergne</HI> his Brother, attracted by the
<PB N="171" REF="88"/> examples of their Brother and their Un∣cle, as well as of the famous <HI>Godfrey,</HI> who filled all <HI>Europe</HI> with admiration in the year 1096. did so signalize themselves, that if they do not Reign in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as their <HI>Ancestors,</HI> they shall at least Reign in the hearts of those that were Spectators of their prowess, and know the laudable ambition they have, to equal the ancient <HI>Counts</HI> of <HI>Bologna, Nassaw, Berg,</HI> and the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Orange.</HI> The <HI>Count de Selle,</HI> the <HI>Chevalier de</HI> St. <HI>Aignan,</HI> the <HI>Marquis de Casteinau,</HI> together with all the other <HI>French Noblemen,</HI> who made up about two thousand Horse, remembring they had for their <HI>King,</HI> and for their Patron <HI>Lewis</HI> the victorious, made it fully ap∣pear, some by their noble deaths, the rest by their Heroick exploits they were resolved to tear the wreaths of <HI>Laurel</HI> out of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s hands, or fall in the gallant attempt.

<PB N="172" REF="89"/> of experience; Insomuch, that this small body, who might have furnished Officers for an Army of fifty thousand men, had a great share in the advantages we gained upon the <HI>Turks</HI> in that <HI>Campagne,</HI> and the renowned actions of the <HI>Count de Co∣ligny,</HI> have acquired him a reputation suf∣ficient to make him famous in <HI>History,</HI> as well as an <HI>Andelot,</HI> an <HI>Admiral,</HI> a <HI>Francis,</HI> and a <HI>Gaspard</HI> his <HI>Ancestours.</HI></P>

<P>If you can have so much patience, I will doe it punctually, in the following Relation.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="174" REF="90"/>
<HEAD>A Relation of the Campagne in <HI>Hungary:</HI> And the Battels of <HI>Kermain,</HI> and Saint <HI>Got∣tard,</HI> between the <HI>German</HI> and Confederate Forces, and the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Army. Also the Articles of Agreement, made betwixt the <HI>Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>French King</HI> having promised to <HI>Count Strozzi</HI> that number of Men he had desired in the name of the <HI>Empe∣rour,</HI> to assist at this <HI>Campagne</HI> against the <HI>Turk,</HI> some of his <HI>Infantry,</HI> who were marched into <HI>Provence,</HI> upon another de∣sign, and some <HI>Cavalry</HI> at that time in <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Parma,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Monsieur de la Fueillade,</HI> had orders to march into <HI>Germany</HI> forthwith. The <HI>Emperour</HI> had the preceding year lost the
<PB N="175" REF="90"/> City of <HI>Neuheusel</HI> in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> and had seen that <HI>Province</HI> plundred, and destroyed by Fire and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Sword, whilst himself was not able to defend it. So that judging he should not be in a capacity to make good this <HI>Campagne</HI> a∣gainst such numerous forces, nor avoid the fatal consequences of the storm that threatned him, he went personally to the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> to resolve with the <HI>Electors,</HI> what means they might best take to preserve the <HI>Empire</HI> from the ap∣proaching danger: soon after this <HI>Diet,</HI> there were levies made all over <HI>Germany,</HI> and the <HI>French King,</HI> as <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Alsatia,</HI> obliged himself to furnish eight <HI>Companies,</HI> and forty <HI>Cornets</HI> of Horse, which were to make up a body of six thousand Men, to be defraid during the whole <HI>Campagne</HI> at the expence of his <HI>Majesty.</HI> The <HI>Count de Coligny</HI> had the command of them, and under him <HI>de la Fueillade,</HI> and <HI>Bodvis Mareshals de Camp.</HI></P>
<P>All the young <HI>Gentlemen</HI> about the <HI>Court</HI> strove to be taken into this service, some to please the <HI>King,</HI> others out of their inclination, and a third sort from the example of the former, which was now become such a kind of necessity, the younger sort could hardly decline it.</P>
<PB N="176" REF="91"/>
<P><HI>Coligny</HI> arrived at <HI>Metz</HI> the 25th of <HI>April,</HI> where the Horse, and those that went <HI>Voluntiers</HI> in this expedition, waited for him.</P>
<P>All these were divided into ten <HI>Squa∣drons,</HI> and the <HI>Squadrons</HI> into four <HI>Bri∣gades,</HI> under <HI>de Gassion, Desfourneaux,</HI> and <HI>de Beauvezé.</HI></P>
<P>They received Orders to march to∣wards <HI>Colmar,</HI> a City in <HI>Alsatia,</HI> which refused to submit to the conditions pro∣pounded to them by the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Maza∣rin,</HI> Governour of that Province.</P>
<P>Now to pass over the particulars of their March, which is not very material, the <HI>French</HI> came at length near the famous City of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and encamped within a League of that place, where the six Re∣giments of <HI>Piedmont, Espernon, Grancé,</HI> and the rest were joyned, and after two days respite, they went forwards. The Emperour being come thither to Hunt, and lodge near their Quarters, saw the said six Regiments in <HI>Battalia,</HI> and the next day came again accompanied by di∣vers persons of quality, and his ordinary Guards.</P>
<P>The <HI>Emperour</HI> then pressed <HI>Monsieur de Coligny</HI> to go and joyn the <HI>German</HI> Army, which lay encamped behind the Fort
<PB N="177" REF="91"/> <HI>Serin.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> did afterwards attack it, and raised also the siege of <HI>Canisia,</HI> and about the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> news came it was taken by assault, though assisted by the Imperial Army. Seven or eight hun∣dred of the Men that were to maintain it perished, and the greatest part of those that endeavour'd to retire towards the Bridge, which made the communication between the Fort and the Army were cut off. This unwelcome news retarded their March, and it was certainly dan∣gerous to go to <HI>Markburg,</HI> as had been intended, to wait for the Horse that were coming from <HI>Italy,</HI> and those other that parted from us at <HI>Donavert</HI> when the Foot embarqued.</P>
<P>Being in the <HI>French</HI> Army my self, I shall, and cannot forbear, to call it our Army, for which you must excuse me, and therefore to go on, I must let you know, that after consultation, they chan∣ged their former measures, and took their road by the Mountains of <HI>Styria</HI> towards <HI>Rakelsburg.</HI> We began this march upon the seventh of <HI>July</HI> by the Plain near <HI>Neustadt,</HI> and the same day passed the River <HI>Leytha,</HI> which parts <HI>Austria</HI> from <HI>Hungary.</HI> From thence we went on by <HI>Odemburg,</HI> which is a pretty large Town,
<PB N="178" REF="92"/> and so towards <HI>Furstenfelt;</HI> a City fortified with six Bastions, but ill situated.</P>
<P>From thence our march was very troublesome through the Mountains to <HI>Rakelsburgh,</HI> where we arrived on the nine and twentieth. It is situate in an Island, encompassed by the River <HI>Muer,</HI> towards the Plain it is fortified with some Bastions, and half Moons, the Ditches are large, deep, and full of Water. The left arm of the River passes within a little distance of the Out-works, the right is nearer yet: but the Fortifications on this side are not so good as the other; and they were then at work with great dili∣gence: and besides, this place is comman∣ded by a high piece of ground, within Musquet-shot, upon which stands a Ca∣stle, guarded by some Out-forts, built at the point of the hill which faces the Town.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Turks</HI> had taken, and razed the great Fort of <HI>Serini,</HI> the Imperial Army repassed the <HI>Muer,</HI> to draw the nearer to <HI>Rakelsburg,</HI> and cover the Countrey the most exposed to the incursi∣ons of the enemies.</P>
<P>This Movement gave <HI>Coligny</HI> the grea∣ter facility to joyn them, which he did upon the 22d day of <HI>July,</HI> so soon as he
<PB N="179" REF="92"/> was informed of the news, by <HI>Monsieur de Bodvis,</HI> whom he had sent purposely for intelligence.</P>
<P>When we joyned the Army, they were encamped in one Line; the <HI>Empe∣rour</HI>'s forces had the right; those of the <HI>Empire</HI> were in the midst, commanded by the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> and such as be∣longed to the Allies had the left, com∣manded by <HI>Count Hollach;</HI> ours posted themselves upon the left of these last.</P>
<P>On the three and twentieth word was brought to the General <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> marched along the River <HI>Raab</HI> to find an easie passage, with design to enter the Countrey. He took a resoluti∣on to march with all the Horse towards <HI>Kermain,</HI> a little Town situate upon the River, and leave the Foot and Baggage, with orders to follow him in haste.</P>
<P>The seven and twentieth, <HI>Spork,</HI> Ge∣neral of the <HI>German</HI> Foot, who conducted them, sent to <HI>la Fueillade</HI> to march im∣mediately, because he had notice that the Enemy approached: and to confirm the Message, he order'd some Volleys of Cannon to be fired from their Camp at St. <HI>Gottard,</HI> where they arrived that morning. This advice obliged us to leave the Baggage with a slender guard,
<PB N="180" REF="93"/> and hasten the march, to joyn the rest of the forces at St. <HI>Gottard.</HI></P>
<P>They encamped very close to avoid some hills which reigned all along the face of the Camp, and were of too large extent to be possessed by the Infantry of three Armies.</P>
<P>Our Troops had the left of the Camp, which was on the Enemies side. The night was spent in making an intrench∣ment, and by morning it was pretty well finished.</P>
<P>In the mean time the City Bridges were repairing, the place being but small and much ruined. Its situation is at the confluence of the <HI>Raab,</HI> and the <HI>Laufsnitz:</HI> but whatever diligence they used in ma∣king up the Bridges, the same could not be compleated till the morning of the eight and twentieth.</P>
<P>Then the Baggage began to go forward, and took up the passage for a whole day. The following night two thousand Foot were commanded to go and joyn the Horse at <HI>Kermain.</HI> But scarce had they began their march, when news came, that the Enemy, after they had been repulsed at <HI>Kermain,</HI> marched directly along the River to St. <HI>Gottard.</HI></P>
<PB N="181" REF="93"/>
<P>This action was honourable to the <HI>French</HI> Horse, the <HI>Turks</HI> attempting their passage in two several places directly be∣fore them: the one being towards the Bridge they were repairing, and which was guarded by some <HI>Hungarians;</HI> the other at a Ford below it; and to favour the <HI>Tartars</HI> in this passage, who had un∣dertaken it, they had caused a considera∣ble body of <HI>Janizaries</HI> to advance to the brink of the River, who by their fire, thought to have made themselves Ma∣sters. They were repulsed every where with great vigour, and for want of In∣fantry to oppose them, there were some Horse commanded to serve on Foot with Musquetoons, the better to maintain this attack, where the <HI>Sieur de la Chau,</HI> a Captain who had the guard of the Ford, with fourscore <HI>Maistres,</HI> bravely repul∣sed all that endeavour'd to pass.</P>
<P>In this combat the Enemies lost a <HI>Pa∣shaw,</HI> named <HI>Ismael,</HI> and some conside∣rable persons on our side were slain: the <HI>Chevalier de Saint Aignan,</HI> and <HI>Mon∣sieur de Chasteau-neuf Aide de Camp, de Sault</HI> and <HI>de Treville</HI> were wounded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> after they had in vain at∣tempted the passages, continued their march along the River, to find one
<PB N="182" REF="94"/> more convenient nearer the Spring-head; the season was very unfit for their design, because that River running at the foot of the <HI>Styrian Mountains,</HI> swells upon the least Rains: and was now so full by the showers that had fallen some days before, that it was fordable in few places. <HI>Montecuculi</HI> sent us notice of their march, which was confirmed by the burning of such Villages as they met with in their way, which gave us the alarm, and ob∣liged all the Army to make ready for the defence of our Camp, which was in a place of great disadvantage, by reason of those high grounds which commanded it. All the rest of the day and night the Souldiers stood to their Arms, although the Enemies made no attempt upon us.</P>
<P>The Horse, who had taken their way by land, and were separated from the Foot at <HI>Donavert,</HI> did this day joyn the Army, having left part of their Baggage behind, to march with the greater speed. In the mean time the Baggage belonging to the Army was gotten over the Bridges, and upon the nine and twentieth the troops began in the morning to march towards the Camp, which had been marked out on the other side of the Ri∣ver, and hardly were the first of them
<PB N="183" REF="94"/> gotten over, but the Van-guard of the Enemies began to appear upon those higher grounds before mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>General Spork,</HI> who had staid in the Camp with the <HI>German</HI> Foot, caused some volleys of Cannon to be fired upon the most advanced, and afterwards retired to follow the rest of the Army, the <HI>Turks</HI> not offering to molest them.</P>
<P>About ten of the clock, our Horse, who observed their march, encamped in such a manner, that they took up the ground which was opposite to the Ene∣mies Camp.</P>
<P>At the same time, they made them∣selves Masters of the River by placing strong guards at convenient distances, which took up the whole extent of the Front; and we passed the rest of all that day in firing our Guns at them, without any great effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> Camp appeared to be dis∣posed in two lines; but the distances were not equal and regular like ours; some parts were better furnished than others, in gross, and without order, most of the Souldiers have Tents, painted green, or some other colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was encamped in the centre, and the <HI>Janizaries</HI> near him.
<PB N="184" REF="95"/> His principal Tent, which glittered in the Sun, appeared to be of Crimson Silk, it was accompanied with many others of different colour'd stuffs, joyned by Gal∣leries shut up with an enclosure of green stuff, like a Wall of seven or eight foot in height; and round about this Park were an infinite number of Tents, which for∣med a kind of a large City in the midst of that numerous Army, composed of well nigh an hundred thousand men.</P>
<P>All this might easily be discerned, be∣cause the Camps, though separated by the River, were not far asunder, and that of the <HI>Turks</HI> was raised in form of an Amphitheatre upon the hills side which they had possessed. But, that which is wonderfull, is, that all these vast Buildings are set up, or taken down in a very short time.</P>
<P>They march ordinarily in great Bodies, without observing any regular distance: each body hath its Drum, which is very large, and because they beat but two strokes at a certain long distance of time, the noise of them is accompanied with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A small shrill brass Trumpet.</NOTE> <HI>Clarions.</HI></P>
<PB N="185" REF="95"/>
<P>At the head of their greater Troops, they carry a world of red and white Ensigns, where for the most part they have a Body of <HI>Tartars,</HI> of whom they make use to over-run and spoil an Ene∣mies Countrey, and to march on the wings of their Army.</P>
<P>They are a people fit for those expedi∣tions, for besides that they are used to Fatigues, they are mounted upon very swift Horses, and well winded, on whose backs they swim over most Rivers. Few of them have any Fire-arms, and for of∣fensive weapons, most of them use only Arrows, besides which they carry a Cy∣mitar by their side, and another fastned to their horses Gyrths, to use upon occa∣sion: Some of them have Javelins also, or Half-pikes, which they dart with great force and skill. Their manner of fight∣ing is not to stand their ground; so soon as they are charged, they scatter in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstant, and rally again with the same faci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, to take their advantage, and fight as they see occasion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Janizaries</HI> are certainly their best men, they fight on foot, and march in great battalions, but without observing, as I told you before, any order, or regu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arity.</P>
<PB N="186" REF="96"/>

<P>The attaque began about nine in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orning, and upon the noise of the Cannon, and Musquets, the rest of the Army stood to their Arms.</P>
<P>These new <HI>German</HI> Companies, could not long withstand the great efforts the <HI>Turks</HI> then made to become Masters of the passage, two Regiments of Infantry were cut in pieces, and the Count of <HI>Nassau,</HI> who commanded one of them, was kill'd upon the place: the Cavalry retired in disorder, and the Enemies ha∣ving secured the Ford, passed into the Plain, where the better part of them drew up in <HI>Battalia,</HI> whilst the others pushed forwards even to the first Houses in the Village.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> seeing them pas∣sed, sent immediately to give notice to
<PB N="190" REF="98"/> <HI>Monsieur de Coligny</HI> of the ill state of af∣fairs, and that no time was to be lost▪ <HI>Coligny</HI> was obliged in so pressing a ne∣cessity to send the nearest Regiments to his aid; <HI>Espagny, Grancé</HI> and <HI>Thurenne</HI> marched thither with all diligence, and at first coming restored the face of affairs, and even drove the Enemy out of the en∣closures of the Village; but after they had withstood their efforts for a time, they were constrained to retire towards the Houses: So that in the last charge, the Regiments of <HI>Espagny</HI> and <HI>Grancé,</HI> were so roughly handled, that being not in a condition to maintain their post, <HI>Monsieur de Guitry,</HI> had orders to cause the Regi∣ment of <HI>la Ferté</HI> to advance, whom they had posted lower towards the banks of the River. Upon his arrival; he seized on the Gardens which had been disputed and began to fire very smartly at the Enemy, who during these several attacks, had filled the Plain with the best forces that had gotten over, and they had in divers parts been casting up several re∣trenchments pretty nigh to one another, and laying a Bridge below the Ford: Notice being given to the Generals, by the <HI>Marquis de la Ferté,</HI> it was resolved to go and attack them in the Plain, since
<PB N="191" REF="98"/> it was impossible otherwise to drive them out of that post, where they had so well secured themselves. <HI>Monsieur de la Fu∣eillade,</HI> whose turn it was that day, brought the Order, which was executed with so little reflexion, and after so pre∣cipitate a manner, that they exposed those foot Companies as a prey to the <HI>Turkish</HI> horse, had not the <HI>French</HI> Squa∣drons, commanded by <HI>Beauvezé,</HI> follow∣ed by two of the <HI>German</HI> Squadrons, ad∣vanced immediately before that Infantry, as soon as they saw them past the Hedges and Defiles, although their Orders were only to second them. The Regiment of <HI>Thurenne</HI> had the right hand of the attack towards the Wood, and was sustained by another of <HI>Germans.</HI> The passage was not very open, <HI>Grancé</HI> and <HI>Espagny</HI> had the midst, and <HI>La Ferté</HI> had the left to∣wards the River, where they were to pass by a way which would not admit of above five or six men in front. Part of this last Regiment marched directly to an entrenchment of the Enemies, where they fired very thick, whilst the rest of their men drew up in <HI>Battalia</HI> behind them: but because they could not get to them without dividing, by reason of the inconveniency of the place, this disad∣vantage
<PB N="192" REF="99"/> added to the novelty of a dread∣full and fierce Enemy, put the Officers to a great deal of trouble to get the Soul∣diers on, who beheld the two <HI>German</HI> Regiments under their feet that had been defeated in the first attack: the dead ha∣ving all their heads cut off, were laid in order of Battel upon the same ground they were to pass over, to march to the Enemy.</P>
<P>Our Horse, in the mean time, who were advanced (as I said) before the Foot, charged the <HI>Turks</HI> with so much vigour, that notwithstanding their great numbers, they were shatter'd. The movement they made by giving ground a little, gave the Souldiers much courage, and then the Foot made such continual dis∣charges as put them wholly into disorder: For being us'd to come to handy blows they could not endure to stand against such firing: And upon the second charge of our Horse their whole body began to give way, and turn their Heads toward the River, and the retrenchments they had made upon the left within forty pa∣ces of each other.</P>
<P>When they were driven into that cor∣ner, they had no other choice, but either to make good their retrenchments, or
<PB N="193" REF="99"/> fling themselves into the Water. This was the cause of that obstinate resistance they made, besides that they were help∣ed by their shot from the great retrench∣ment, which raked all along from the other side of the River, whereby the Regiment of <HI>La Ferte,</HI> was much incom∣moded, however they gained the re∣trenchments on this side, though the last of them was defended for a long time by the Enemies, and that was the last effort they made in this Battel. For af∣ter that they were totally disorder'd in all parts, and cast themselves in great crowds into the River, whose stream is very rapid, it was wholly cover'd with them for above an hour; the greatest part were drowned, the remainders perish'd by our Soldiers, who fired incessantly upon such as endeavour'd to gain the farther shore, the ground being pretty steep on either side.</P>
<P>The terrour and consternation grew so universal, at last, in their whole Army, that without considering whether it were easie for our Troops to pass the River and follow them, they abandoned their great retrenchment on the other side, and the two Batteries, they had made there, not daring to return the night fol∣lowing,
<PB N="194" REF="100"/> during which, by reason of the obscurity and the continual rains, they might have carried off their Cannon, without the least knowledge of any one.</P>
<P>The Combat lasted about four hours, and concluded with a considerable loss on either hand, above six thousand of the best of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the greater part of the youth who were near the grand Vi∣zier, and had passed the River, fell in this Battel: and we had twelve, or fif∣teen hundred wounded or slain; amongst others the Count <HI>de Mouchy</HI> a Colonel, and the Count of <HI>Nassau,</HI> the Marquis <HI>Villeroy</HI> was wounded with an Arrow: The Counts <HI>de Serry</HI> and <HI>Beauvezé</HI> were hurt, <HI>Messieurs de Bouillon</HI> made themselves famous by their valiant performances.</P>
<P>The better part of the Success of this illustrious Action is owing to the <HI>French</HI> Nation, who though but few in Num∣ber, and without any very considerable assistance of the Imperialists, were able to overcome an Enemy entrenched, and who had the advantages of the place. Who by their taking of the Fort <HI>Serini,</HI> had struck all the <HI>German</HI> Provinces with terrour, as well as the Emperour's Army. The new raised <HI>German</HI> Regiments ran a∣way above two leagues from the Camp,
<PB N="195" REF="100"/> during the fight, though they were not attacked. The Generals with the rest of the troops expected the event. Their baggage was loaden, and every one was rather considering how to make their es∣cape, than any ways to assist those that fought, and although such a retreat must have been difficult to be put in execution before an Enemy puff'd up with good Success, and who do ordinarily fight with impetuosity; nevertheless the Imperia∣lists had a design of throwing up a work before them in haste, from those woods which lay near them, to the River side; and our <HI>French</HI> to secure a passage for themselves upon the River of <HI>Laufnitz,</HI> had left the Regiment of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> to guard the head of the Bridge, near St. <HI>Godthard,</HI> where the baggage and the rest of the troops, were to pass, to get to <HI>Furstenfelt.</HI></P>
<P>The defeat and rout of the Enemies, which they had scarce faith to believe at first, deliver'd all of us from those trou∣bles and cares, and every one was so sa∣tisfied with this good fortune, that they did not so much as consider, whether it were fit to make use of this advantage, and pass over some Forces at this Ford which the Enemies had abandon'd, and
<PB N="196" REF="101"/> likewise at St. <HI>Godthard,</HI> to attack the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp, where the terrour was so great, that the <HI>Vizier</HI> caused several prin∣cipal Officers to be put to death in his own presence, who notwithstanding all he could urge, were preparing to flye. It is most certain, that if they had made use of this consternation, as it was easie to have done, we might that very day have gained the greatest Victory, that any Christian Army hath obtained for a long time, against the Infidels: But they were satisfied with guarding only those passes they had won with their Infantry, which they did all the night in great quietness, the <HI>Turks</HI> not making the least attempt to recover their Cannon they had left behind, in their great retrench∣ment. During the above mentioned fight, the <HI>Turks</HI> had sent some troops di∣rectly over against the Imperial Camp, who were charged and defeated by <HI>Spork,</HI> General of the Horse, who compell'd them to repass the River.</P>
<P>The next day, being the second of <HI>August,</HI> the Enemy removed their Camp out of the Valley, and posted themselves upon the higher ground, where they planted their Guns, which they fired the whole day upon those works we had
<PB N="197" REF="101"/> made to secure the troops who guarded the passage.</P>
<P>The day after they continued the same thing, though the Cannon had but the same effect, and at midnight they began to decamp, and marched the same way, as they came.</P>
<P>Our Army did on this side the River, make the same movements as they, and thus they marched in sight of each other till the seventh, when the Enemies reti∣red towards <HI>Canisia:</HI> and there being great scarcity amongst our men, they were order'd to march along the <HI>Raab,</HI> that they might get provisions and forrage, they remained till the twentieth in the Villages neighbouring to <HI>Oedemburg.</HI></P>
<P>About the end of the Month, they marched towards <HI>Presburg,</HI> along the shore of the Lake <HI>Neusidlesee,</HI> which is seven leagues in compass, and derives its name from the abundance of Fish taken there. And in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> the Armies being encamped near <HI>Virtemburg,</HI> there came News that the Enemies were to pass the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Gran,</HI> to enter upon <HI>Hungary;</HI> this made them change the design they had concluded on to march along that River to the Cities of <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Comorra,</HI> and to pass afterwards over
<PB N="198" REF="102"/> a Bridge of Boats at <HI>Presburg,</HI> and oppose their designs.</P>
<P>They marched therefore near <HI>Huesen</HI> and <HI>Tirnaw,</HI> towards the River <HI>Vagh,</HI> which runs near <HI>Neuheusel,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Danube</HI> above <HI>Comorra.</HI> Then did there come intelligence that the <HI>Turks</HI> had passed, but none could precisely tell what their resolutions were; it was at first believed they would besiege <HI>Levens,</HI> situate between <HI>Neuheusel</HI> and <HI>Gran,</HI> which had been taken at the beginning of the <HI>Campagne</HI> by Count <HI>Souches,</HI> but in the end we understood that it was but a party which they had detached to rein∣force <HI>Neuheusel,</HI> and post themselves be∣hind it to hinder the besieging it.</P>
<P>A great train of Artillery which the Emperour sent to his Army, had given them this jealousie: They were then posted at the Mouth of the <HI>Vagh,</HI> behind was a Bridge on the <HI>Danube</HI> to pass into the Island of <HI>Schut,</HI> where the Forces under Count <HI>Souches</HI> were encamped. This re-inforcement made them delibe∣rate to go and attack the <HI>Turks</HI> in their post, and several days were vainly spent in these deliberations, there being always some obstacle or other that hindred the execution, and as if there had been some
<PB N="199" REF="102"/> contests between Count <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> and the Commanders of the <HI>French</HI> Forces, who suffer'd very much after the Battel, and demanded provisions with great ear∣nestness: It was perceived that this <HI>Italian</HI> General, subtile no doubt, but of that sort of subtilty ordinary in those of his Nati∣on, and fitter for the Cabinet Council, than at the head of an Army, intended nothing less, than to march against the Enemy, and who affected that pretence so much, only because he saw the Army so harassed and weather-beaten, that thereby he might in some sort diminish the honour they had acquired at St. <HI>Godthard,</HI> by the reproaches he made, that we were the cause of hindring that design; he indeed nobly proposed it the first, though he had no mind to put it in practise, as being assured that a Treaty of Peace was then on foot, which had for some time been secretly managed for his Master: But the better to conceal his intentions he had marched towards the head of the <HI>Vagh,</HI> making a show as if he would draw nearer the Enemy, for that purpose. The <HI>French</HI> Troops being ill guided in this march, found themselves upon the two and twentieth within five little leagues of <HI>Neuheusel,</HI> and distant
<PB N="200" REF="103"/> from the rest of the Army above two, in danger of being surprized, because the River that lay before them was fordable in many places, and the mistake was not found out till towards noon. <HI>Mon∣sieur de Coligny</HI> being fallen sick, and car∣ried to <HI>Tirnau: Monsieur de la Fueillade</HI> in his abscence caused them forthwith to march off, and rejoyn the gross of the Army, the <HI>Turks</HI> not having attempted any thing upon us: They had some few days before, defeated a party of <HI>German</HI> Horse, and by the return of some of those Prisoners we first heard the News of the Peace in the Camp, and the Cessation of Arms was proclaimed upon the thirtieth of <HI>September,</HI> the conditions thereof were as follows.</P>
