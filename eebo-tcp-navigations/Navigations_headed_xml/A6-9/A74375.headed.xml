<HEAD>AN ACT For preventing Injuries and VVrongs done to Merchants at Sea, In their Persons, Ships or Goods, And prohibiting Mariners from serving under Forraign Princes or States without License.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>VHereas since the late Act made the Five and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> One thousand six hun∣dred forty nine, (enti∣tuled, <HI>An Act touching Letters of Mart</HI>) The Parliament having re∣ceived Information, That divers French Ships, and others of Forraign Nations, have taken upon them <HI>de facto,</HI> to visit the said English Ships, and to make search what goods they carried, and un∣der colour thereof, have spoiled divers of their Ships, and seized others, and committed se∣veral wrongs and abuses, to the great damage of the good People of this Commonwealth; For remedy whereof, and for the better enabling the Merchants to preserve their Ships and Goods against such Wrongs and Injuries for the future, Be it Enacted and Ordained by this present Parliament, and by the Authority of the same, That the Councel of State for the time
<PB N="800" REF="3"/> being, established by Parliament, shall have full and absolute power, and are hereby authorized and enabled, not onely to hear and examine all Petitions and Complaints of this nature; and thereupon, and upon consideration of the cir∣cumstances of the case, and observations of such solemnities specified in the said former Act of the Five and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> to grant and give Warrant for special and particular Letters of Mart to the parties injured and damnified in this kinde, in such sort and maner as they are enabled to grant in any other case by that said former Act; But also to grant and give Warrant for, and cause to be issued out under the Seal of the Court of Admiralty, in the Name of the <HI>Keepers of the Liberty of <HI>England,</HI> esta∣blished by Parliament,</HI> special and particular Com∣missions to all or any such Merchants Ships, or, other English Ships, as the said Coun∣cel of State shall finde meet, to enable them and give them free License and Authority, not onely to deny and make defence against any such visi∣tation or commands, to be visited by any such French or other Forraign Ships for the time to come; but also as they may finde opportunity to fight with, surprize and take all and every such French Ships or Vessels, and other Forraign Ships (together with all the Ordnance, Am∣munition, Tackle, Furniture, Goods, Wares and Merchandizes found in or belonging to the same) that shall so require or command them to be visited, or attempt to spoil, annoy, molest, disturb or hinder them in their trading or mer∣chandizing voyages, under colour of such undue visitation. Provided always, That if they shall happen so to surprize or take any such French Ships or Forraign Vessels as aforesaid, That
<PB N="801" REF="3"/> after the said Surprizal &amp; Fight ended, they shall not kill or slay any of the persons therein taken, nor commit any man-slaughter in cold blood, but shal use them civilly, only restraining and de∣taining them as Prisoners (if they may without prejudice to their Ship or their voyages) to be sent over into <HI>England,</HI> to be proceeded against or disposed of as the Councel of State shall advise; otherwise if they shall finde it hazardous or da∣mageable so to do, Then to set them on shore where they may have opportunity, so always that they retain three at the least of the principal that shall be taken to be brought or sent into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and examined in the Admiralty Court, up∣on all such questions as shall in that Court be thought fit, for the discovering the truth of the matter, how and in what sort the said For∣raign Ships did first require or attempt to fight with the English, or command them to suffer themselves to be visited, or what other injuries or abuses they offered them, with all other cir∣cumstances requisite in the case. And provided further, That the Takers shall be obliged to proceed in the Court of Admiralty of <HI>England,</HI> against all Ships and Goods so taken, and bring the same to Iudgement, according to the course of that Court; and if it shall be duly proved and made appear, that they were taken by reason of their undue commitment of any of the particu∣lars before recited, mentioned and provided against in and by this Act, That then and in that case, the Iudges of the said Court shall give Iudgement that the same were lawfully taken, and that the same were and are lawful Prizes to the Owners and Captain, or Master and Marriners of the Ship or Ships, takers whereof; two thirds to be to the Owners in re∣spect
<PB N="802" REF="4"/> of their extraordinary charge to Arm and Man their Ships in an extraordinary maner for this occasion; and the other third to be to the Master and Marriners, to be shared amongst them according to custom of the Sea in such case. Provided also, That the Tenths of all such Prizes, or the true and full value thereof without deduction, shall be duly paid to the Col∣lectors of Prize-Goods, to be disposed of by the Councel of State as they shall see cause, for the use of the Commonwealth. And provided fur∣ther, That for every such Commission before the same issue forth under the Seal, security shall be taken with Securities by Recognizance in the Admiralty Court in the sum of Two thou∣sand pounds, not to harm or prejudice the Mer∣chants or good People of this Commonwealth, or any of the Friends or Allies of this Nation, in any other case then in the cases before recited, mentioned and provided against in and by this Act; and likewise to observe and follow all such other Clauses, Instructions and things, as the Councel of State shall at the time of giving Warrant for any such Commission think meet, and order or appoint. And whereas divers En∣glish Marriners and Seamen, have of late time served in the Ships of Forraign Princes, and in Forraign Vessels (contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Nation) and therein done dis-service to and against the English Mer∣chants; Be it Enacted, That all English Mar∣riners and Seamen, that are now serving abroad in the Service of any Forraign Prince or State, shall within the space of four Moneths next en∣suing, withdraw themselves from such Forraign Service, and repair home to serve the Common∣wealth of <HI>England</HI> according to their duty, under
<PB N="803" REF="4"/> pain to be severely punished: And to the end that no English Ship, either Merchants or other, may be hereafter lost, taken or yielded up by the treachery or cowardize of any Marriner, or other aboard the said Ship; Be it also Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any Captain, Ma∣ster or Commander of any English Ship, shall from henceforth through falshood, or any other ground or reason, neglect to do his duty in de∣fence of the Ship wherein he is Master or Com∣mander; or if any Marriner, or other person whatsoever aboard any such Ship, shall trea∣cherously offer to cry for Quarter, or to yield up the said Ship, without the special order of the said Captain, Master or Commander in Chief, or shall dishearten any of the rest of the Marri∣ners, or refuse to stand to his Arms in time of fight or danger, That in every such case, the Of∣fender or Offenders being duly tryed and proved to be guilty, shall incur and suffer the pains of death, or such other punishment as the nature or quality of the Offence shall deserve: And if any English Marriners and Seamen, shal from and after the passing of this Act depart out of <HI>England,</HI> and enter into any Forraign Service (without special License first obtained) that eve∣ry such Offence shall be punished with death. Provided, That the penalties in this Act contained, prohibiting Marriners to be enter∣tained in the Service of Forraign Princes, shall not extend to Marriners serving in English Ships, under English Commanders, enter∣tained in the Service of such Forraign States in the way of Merchandize, as are in Amity with this Commonwealth. And whereas divers guilty persons, subject to the ancient Iuris∣diction of the Admiralty, there to be tryed and
<PB N="804" REF="5"/> punished for their criminal Offences, have lately committed foul misdemeanors upon the Sea, and in Ships and otherwise, giving out, That the Criminal part of the Iurisdiction of the Admiralty Court was taken away by a late Act of Parliament, made the Twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> One thousand six hundred forty nine (entituled, <HI>An Act for punishment of Crimes com∣mitted upon or beyond the Seas</HI>) and that therefore they hoped to avoid such punishment as was due unto them, whereas the Parliament did not intend by the said Act, nor any Clause there∣in, to abridge or diminish (much less to take away) the Power or Iurisdiction of the Admi∣ralty in Criminal causes; Be it therefore De∣clared and Enacted by this present Parliament, and by the Authority of the same, That the Councel of State in whom the power of the Admiralty is placed, and the Court of Admi∣ralty and Iudges thereof, and all and every of them, shall &amp; may hear, order &amp; determine all and all maner of Crimes, Contempts, Misdemea∣nors and Offences whatsoever, done or commit∣ted, or to be had, done or committed within or against the Precincts and Iurisdiction of the Admiralty, as fully, freely and intirely as they or any of them might have done before the making of the said Act of the Twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> and in as large and ample maner as if that Act had never been made; and that Com∣missions of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> shall issue out un∣der the Great Seal, directed to the Iudges of the Admiralty, and other discreet persons, for the tryal of Maritine Offenders, as by the Laws and Customs was formerly used in the Admiralty.</P>
