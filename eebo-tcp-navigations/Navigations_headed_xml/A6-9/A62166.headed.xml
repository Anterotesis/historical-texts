<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here present you with an abstract of the Lives and Memoir's of the most famous and Illustrious Per∣sonages of this Realm, since the Con∣quest to this present time; for order sake I have digested it Alphabetically into the several Shires and Counties contained in this Kingdom; which I
<PB REF="4"/>
hope will find a kind acceptance, there being nothing of the same method now Extant.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> in his large History in <HI>Folio,</HI> did go a great way in this mat∣ter, but here is included the Lives of many more eminent Heroes and gene∣rous Patrons, (which I hope their memory may survive in succeeding Ages) this being done with that bre∣vity, which may be more beneficial to the Reader.</P>
<P>Here you have the Original or rise of most of the Eminent Families in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Also, an Epitome of the most ma∣terial matters in Church and State, containing the Lives of the most Emi∣nent
<PB REF="4"/>
Fathers in the English Church, and the most Flourishing Statesmen in the latter times; Also the most famous Authors, as well Divine as Histori∣cal; together with the Lives of the most Memorable Persons in the Law, Mathematicks, Geographers, Astro∣nomers, Poets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which have made this. Kingdom known throughtout the World.</P>
<P>I need not inlarge, or give any further Incomium upon this subject, but referr you to the Table first, and then to the Book it self, which I hope will find that kind acceptance, that may ingage me in some further proce∣dure that may please my Countrymen, which I shall alwayes endeavour to
<PB REF="5"/>
do in plainness and brevity to the Readers satisfaction, and in the mean time, am</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The Design of the Work.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Rooms of the House being described by others, 'tis my intention to describe the Furniture, <HI>viz.</HI> the Commodities, with the Persons of Quality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the several Shires of <HI>England.</HI> But it may be asked <HI>Cui bono? To what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od end?</HI> I Answer. 1. <HI>To gain some Glory to God.</HI> 2. <HI>To reserve the Memories of the Dead.</HI> 3. <HI>To present examples to the Living.</HI> 4. <HI>To entertain the Reader with delight.</HI> 5. <HI>To procure some honest profit to my self.</HI></P>
<P>The matter is either <HI>Real,</HI> viz. The Commodi∣ties and Observables of every County, or Personal,
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
the Characters of those worthy Men, who were Natives thereof.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>The Real Topicks insisted on, in the Respective Counties,</HI></HEAD>
<P>1. THE Native Commodities; Of which, if any be general to all <HI>England,</HI> it is entered in that County where there was the <HI>first,</HI> or else the <HI>most</HI> and <HI>best</HI> of that kind. 2 The Manufactures, Admirable for <HI>Rarity</HI> and <HI>Variety;</HI> Of which, such as are not properly <HI>Natural,</HI> but <HI>Mixed,</HI> are pro∣misouously placed. 3 Medicinal Waters, Wonder∣ful for <HI>Colour, Tast, Odour, Sound, Heat, Weight, Motion</HI> and <HI>Effects.</HI> The last is proper for my Pen. 4. The Wonders, or Rarities, which are <HI>Transiem</HI> or Permanent. The Wonders of <HI>England</HI> are as conside∣rable for kind as those of other Countries. 5. The Buildings; of which the Churches are most admi∣rable. 6. Local Proverbs, and there are Six essen∣tials of a Proverb, that it be Short, Plain, Common, Figurative, Ancient and True. I have only insisted upon the most considerable Local Proverbs, that suggest to us some <HI>Historical Hint,</HI> and have declined all such as are <HI>Narrow, Frivolous, Scurrillous</HI> and <HI>Scanda∣lous.</HI> 7. Medicinal herbs, which if rare and very useful are placed next the Medicinal Waters, in the re∣spective Counties.</P>

<ITEM>3. Martyrs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Confessors.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FOr the First, I take notice of the Legitimate Issue; as to Saints, I am sorry that the Lives of some of them, are so darkened with <HI>Needless,</HI> if not <HI>false</HI> Illustrations, to their Dishonour, and the De∣triment of Church History, which has arisen from the Ignorance or Disingenuity of the Writers of their Lives, or for want of true matter, or for hope of gain, or lastly for this, <HI>that they saw it pleased the People.</HI> Whence it is true, what</P>
<P><HI>Melchior Canus</HI> says, <HI>I speak it to my</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 11. <HI>c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>grief that the Lives of the Philosophers are more gravely Written by</HI> Laertius, <HI>than Saints are by Christians.</HI> Our Catalogue contains only <HI>English</HI> Saints, wherefore <HI>Anselm</HI> is left out as being a <HI>French-</HI>Man, since whom the Pope has been very sparing to confer the Honour of Saintship; because, the multitude of Saints, abates Veneration, and would overcharge the Calender, that already labours with the <HI>Sacred burden;</HI> besides the charge of Canonization is great, and his <HI>Holiness</HI> unwilling to bestow it <HI>gratis;</HI> and lastly, Protestants shrewdly suspect that some unworthy Persons have been <HI>served</HI> with the Dignity by that <HI>Servant of the Servants of God,</HI> there∣fore none are Canonized while their <HI>Memories are</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<HI>on the Must,</HI> immediately after their Deaths, before the same be fined in the <HI>Cask,</HI> with some competent time. As to the third, <HI>viz. Martyrs,</HI> who have lost their Lives for the <HI>Testimony</HI> of a fundamental Truth; those our Land hath produced, are either <HI>Brittains,</HI> who suffered under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> or <HI>Saxons</HI> Massacred by the <HI>Danes,</HI> or lastly <HI>English</HI> Martyred by the Papists, since the year 1400. I shall tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the last, the two former being done already. For the last, <HI>viz.</HI> Confessors, they are such who have lost all but Life, for the truth, and escaped Martyr∣dom very narrowly; who were as <HI>Wax,</HI> ready for the <HI>Signature</HI> of Death; But, <HI>Threatned folks Live long,</HI> yea threatned <HI>Elijah</HI> by Gods Miraculous Pro∣vidence, never died.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of Popes, Cardinals and Prelates, before the Reformation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere have been four Popes <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and but six <HI>Germans,</HI> tho <HI>Germany</HI> be five times bigger then <HI>England,</HI> which boasts of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> formerly accounted <HI>Pope of England.</HI> As for Cardinals, they were anciently no more then Curats, made by Bishops, as well as by the Pope, For, there were founded, anciently, in the Church of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> two Cardinals chosen by Dean and Chapter, out of the twelve petty Cannons, whose Office was to look to those of the Quire, to give the Eucharist, to the Minister of that Church and his Servants, to hear Confessions, appoint Penance, and to commit the Dead to convenient Sepulture, and two of them lie buried in the Church of St. <HI>Faiths.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
This Custom of Cardinal-making was in many other Countries, but afterwards, was appropriated to <HI>Rome,</HI> where they are divided into Bishops, who are Assessors with the Popes Priests, who are Assist∣ants, and Deacons, <HI>Qui serviunt Servo Servorum Dei,</HI> who are Attendants on his Holiness. The Bishops are seven, <HI>viz.</HI> Bishop of 1 <HI>Hostia,</HI> 2 <HI>Sabine,</HI> 3 <HI>Porto,</HI> 4 <HI>Alba,</HI> 5 <HI>Preneste,</HI> in which three last places, these <HI>Englishmen</HI> respectively have been Bishops, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. <HI>Kilwardby, Nic.

<P>Pope <HI>Paul</HI> II. made it Penal, for any beneath their Order, in <HI>Rome,</HI> to wear a <HI>Red hat.</HI> The Cardinal-Bishops took place of the Emperour before his Co∣ronation, and of other Kings. The Popes were to be chosen by, and out of that Order. The Cardinal-Deacons were oftentimes elected to the Popedom before the Cardinal-Priests. There is at this day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Brother of the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> enjoys the Title and Dignity of Cardinal. 'Tis alledged by some that <HI>Englishmen</HI> being of a different Religion from his Holiness, and in a manner, exiles abroad,
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
and not furnished with sufficient Estates, are there∣fore seldom honoured with that Dignity, which has been fatal to several <HI>Englishmen;</HI> for Card. <HI>Maekeli∣field</HI> was buried four Months before his Cap was brought him; Card. <HI>Sertor</HI> died in <HI>Italy</HI> in the juncture of time, <HI>inter pileum Datum &amp; Susceptum.</HI> Card. <HI>Fisher,</HI> when his Cap was come to <HI>Calis,</HI> had his head struck off at <HI>Tower-Hill.</HI> Card. <HI>Somercot</HI> was Poysoned, in the Conclave, to prevent his Election to the Popedom. Card. <HI>Evosham</HI> was sent the same way, on the same occasion. Card. <HI>Bambridge</HI> was Poisoned at <HI>Rome,</HI> by one of his Servants, being an <HI>Italian.</HI></P>

<P>SHeriff is a <HI>Reeve</HI> or Overseer of a <HI>Shire,</HI> in Latin <HI>Vicecomes,</HI> or Deputy of an <HI>Earl</HI> or Count, who anciently presiding over a <HI>County,</HI> gave names both to the <HI>Place,</HI> and deputed Jurisdiction.

His Power is to suppress <HI>Riots,</HI> secure Prison∣ers, distrain for Debts, execute Writs, return <HI>Knights</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> for Parliament, empannel <HI>Juries,</HI> attend the Judge, see the Execution of Ma∣lefactors, &amp;c.

fancy are but personal, but Arms <HI>assigned</HI> by Princes are Hereditary. The plainer the Coat is, the more Ancient and Honourable; two Colours are necessary and most highly honourable, tho both may be bla∣zoned with one word, as <HI>Varrey,</HI> (formerly born by the <HI>Beauchamps</HI> of <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ch</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and still quar∣tered by the Duke of <HI>Somerset) three</HI> are very ho∣nourable, <HI>four</HI> Commendable, <HI>five</HI> Excuseable, more disgraceful. One said of a <HI>Coat,</HI> that it was so well Victualled that it might endure a Siege, such was the Plenty and Variety of Fowl, Flesh and Fish there∣in. <HI>Or</HI> and <HI>Azure</HI> are the richest, <HI>Argent</HI> and <HI>Sable</HI> the fairest Coats. The <HI>Lion</HI> and <HI>Eagle</HI> are the most Honourable, the <HI>Cross</HI> the most Religious be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ring; a <HI>Bend</HI> the best <HI>Ordinarie,</HI> being a <HI>Belt</HI> athwart, as a <HI>Fess</HI> is the same about the middle.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. <HI>Of the number of Counties in</HI> England, <HI>and why the Worthies are digested County-wise.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF <HI>English Shires</HI> or <HI>Counties,</HI> there are <HI>nine</HI> and <HI>thirty,</HI> at this day, which by the <HI>thirteen</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> are made up <HI>fifty</HI> two; among which <HI>Bark∣shire,</HI> from the Conquest, till the year 1607 had no <HI>Count</HI> or <HI>Earl</HI> thereof, tho in the times of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> it had an <HI>Officiary Count.</HI></P>
<P>The Worthies in this Work are digested Coun∣ty-wise, because, First, the Method being new, may be acceptable for its Novelty. Secondly, it is as informative to our Judgments to order them by Counties as <HI>Centuries.</HI> Here you may behold how each County is innated with a particular <HI>Genius,</HI> inclining the Natives thereof to be dextrous, some in one profession some in another; and how the same County was not always equally fruitful in the production of worthy Persons, but, as trees are observed to have their <HI>bearing</HI> and <HI>barren</HI> years, so Shires have their rise and fall, in affording Famous Persons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. <HI>Of the Clergy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was fashionable for the <HI>Clergy,</HI> (especially Regular) to have their <HI>Surnames,</HI> from the places of their Nativity; As <HI>Richard</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> quitted <HI>Angervill,</HI> tho his Father Sir <HI>Richard Angervill</HI> was a Knight of Worth and Worship, to be called
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
of <HI>Bury,</HI> where he was born, and <HI>William</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> waved <HI>Pattin,</HI> to wear <HI>Waynfleet,</HI> tho he was eldest Son to <HI>Richard Pattin,</HI> an Esquire of great Ancientry.</P>
<P>Sometimes the place of one's birth is rendred uncertain, when several places have the same name. One instance of many, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham</HI> was the famous Founder of <HI>New Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford:</HI> But how can his Cradle be certainly fixed in any place, when it is equally rock't betwixt <HI>twenty</HI> Villages of the same Denomination? In inquiries of this Nature and Difficulty, 'tis best to have recourse to the Cir∣cumstances in the History of such a controverted Person. Where two or more places claim the birth of the same Person, my usual expedient is to insert the Character at large, of the controverted Person in that County, which produceth the best Evidence for him, yet so, that I also enter his name with a reference in the other respective places, which with probability pretend unto him. But many multiply differences in the places of Mens birth by mistake. The Papists can tell you a Tale how the Men of <HI>two</HI> Towns in <HI>Germany</HI> fell out and fought together, whilst one of them was for <HI>Martin,</HI> the other for <HI>Luther,</HI> being but the several Names of the same Person. If one Author affirms Bishop <HI>Jewel</HI> born at <HI>Buden,</HI> another at <HI>Berinerber,</HI> let none make strife betwixt these two Writers, the former naming the House and Village, the later the Parish wherein he was born.</P>
<P>As for the Sons of Ministers, tho some unchari∣tably think them <HI>generally unfortunate,</HI> by the sequel of this Treatise it will plainly appear that they have by <HI>Gods</HI> Blessing, proved as eminent as any who have raised themselves by their own endeavours. For Statesmen, <HI>George Carew,</HI> Privy Councellor of
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
<HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and as able a Man, as the Age he lived in, produced, was <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Totnes,</HI> the same place whereof his Father was Arch-Deacon. Sir <HI>Edwin Sandys,</HI> Son to Arch-Bshiop <HI>Sandys,</HI> was a Man of such Merit, that <HI>England</HI> could not afford an Office which he could not manage. For Lawyers, Sir <HI>Th. Richardson,</HI> lately, and the never sufficiently to be commended Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgeman,</HI> now Lord Chief Justice, with many others. For Seamen, Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> that great <HI>Scourge</HI> and <HI>Terrour</HI> to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Pride. But the Sons of Ministers have never been more Successfull, then when bred in the Pro∣fessions of their Fathers. Thus of the Prelatical Clergy we have <HI>Francis Godwin</HI> a Bishop, the Son of a Bishop, and Dr. <HI>John King,</HI> Son to the Reverend Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> And of others, we have three Generations of the <HI>Wards,</HI> in <HI>Suffolk.</HI> As many of the <HI>Shutes,</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> no less painfull then Pious and able in their Professions. Let me add, that there were at one time three Fellows of Kings Colledge, Sons of eminent Divines, and afterwards Doctors of Divinity, <HI>viz. Sam. Collins, Th. Goad,</HI> and <HI>Will. Sclater.</HI> And I believe there were not severally in their Generations, Men more Signal, in their diffe∣rent Eminencies.</P>

<P>I <HI>Tell you my Tale and Tale-Master,</HI> First to <HI>vindi∣cate</HI> the <HI>Writer,</HI> secondly the better to inform the Reader. The Authors I use may be reduced to three Heads. 1. <HI>Printed Books.</HI> 2. <HI>Records</HI> in <HI>publick Offices.</HI> 3. <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> in the possession of private Gentle∣men. 4. <HI>Instructions</HI> received from the <HI>nearest Relati∣ons</HI> to those persons whose Lives we have presented. The <HI>printed Books</HI> are cited in the Margin. As for <HI>Records,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Riley Master</HI> of those in the Tow∣er had great <HI>care</HI> in <HI>securing, dexterity</HI> in <HI>finding, di∣ligence</HI> in <HI>perusing</HI> them, and <HI>courtesie</HI> in <HI>Communica∣ting</HI> such <HI>Copies</HI> of them as my occasions required.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. <HI>Of a Two-fold English Gentry,</HI> viz. <HI>by Nation and Profession.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Begin with the Ancient <HI>Britains</HI> who Inhabited the <HI>South,</HI> and were succeeded by the <HI>Saxons</HI> in the <HI>West.</HI> As for the more Ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> their Descendants are not by any Character discernable from the <HI>British.</HI> The Off-spring of the <HI>Saxons</HI> are the main <HI>bulk</HI> and body, not of the Gentry but of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. These, tho pitifully dispersed by the Conqueror, yet by <HI>God's Goodness,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> I. his <HI>favour,</HI> their own <HI>patience</HI> and <HI>diligence,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ut together the Planks of their Ship-wrackt Estates and afterwards recovered a Competent condition. The <HI>Danes</HI> were rather <HI>Inroders</HI> here then Inhabitants, of whose Extraction there are therefore few in our Age, among whom the <HI>Denizes</HI> (often Sheriffs in <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Glocestershire)</HI> appear the principal. As for <HI>Fitz-Harding,</HI> the younger Son of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and direct Ancestor of the truly Honou∣rable <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> he came long since, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>he accompanied the Conquerour. They seem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>err who are of Opinion, that those Names which end in <HI>son,</HI> as <HI>Johnson, Thomson,</HI> &amp;c. are of <HI>Da∣nish</HI> Origination, since the <HI>Danes</HI> had no such Names in use among them as <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Thomas, &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Normans,</HI> after the Conquest became the only <HI>visible Gentry</HI> of this Nation, and still continue more then a moiety thereof. There are some Surnames of the good Families in <HI>England</HI> now extant, which tho
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
<HI>French,</HI> are not to be recovered in the Lists of such as came over with the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> and therefore we suppose them to have remained of those Gentlemen which from <HI>Hanault</HI> attended Queen <HI>Isabel,</HI> Wife to King <HI>Edward</HI> II. Of this sort was <HI>Deureux, Mollineux, Darcy, Coniers, Longchamp, Henage, Sa∣vage, Danvers,</HI> &amp;c. Of the <HI>British</HI> or <HI>Welsh,</HI> af∣ter their Expulsion hence by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> some sig∣nal persons have returned again, and by the <HI>Kings</HI> Grant, <HI>Matches, Purchases, &amp;c.</HI> have fixed them∣selves in fair Possessions in <HI>England,</HI> especially since the beginning of the Reign of their Countrey-man King <HI>Henry 7th.</HI> rewarding the Valour of ma∣ny Contributing to his Victory at the Battle of <HI>Bos∣worth.</HI> Of the <HI>Welsh</HI> now re-estated in <HI>England</HI> and often <HI>Sheriffs</HI> therein, some retain their old <HI>Surnames,</HI> as the <HI>Griffins</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> the <HI>Griffiths</HI> and <HI>Vaughans</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> some have assumed <HI>New ones,</HI> as the <HI>Caradocks,</HI> now known by the Name of <HI>New∣tons</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></P>
<P>Many <HI>Scotch,</HI> long before the Union of the <HI>Two</HI> Kingdoms under King <HI>James,</HI> seated themselves in this Land, resorting hither for Succour from their <HI>Civil Wars.</HI> Distress at Sea hath driven others in, as the <HI>Stewards, High-Sheriffs</HI> in <HI>Cambridgeshire.</HI> As o∣ther Accidents have occasioned the coming in of the <HI>Scrimpshires,</HI> an <HI>hundred</HI> years since <HI>High Sheriffs</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> more lately the <HI>Napers</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> and before both the <HI>Scots-Hall</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Irish</HI> of any Eminency, their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Inclination</HI> have drawn them to other Countries rather then <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>Italian</HI> Nation, very few have founded Fa∣milies in <HI>England,</HI> yet have we a Sprinkling of <HI>Ita∣lian: Protestants, Castilian,</HI> a Valiant Gentleman of <HI>Barkshire,</HI> the <HI>Baffanoes,</HI> Excellent Painters and Mu∣sicians

<P>The <HI>High dutch</HI> of the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns, anciently much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>onversed in our Land, known by the Name of <HI>Ea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>erlings,</HI> invited hither by the large Priviledges our Kings conferred upon them, so that the <HI>Steel-Yard</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>he <HI>Gold-yard</HI> unto them; But these Merchants moved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ound in their own <HI>Sphere,</HI> matching among themselves, without mingling with our Nation. Only we may presume that the <HI>Easterlings,</HI> commonly called the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tradlings,</HI> formerly Sheriffs in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and still fa∣mous in <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> with the <HI>Nestphalings,</HI> late∣ly Sheriffs of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> were originally of <HI>German</HI> Extraction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Low Countrey-men</HI> frighted by Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>'s <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ong-Nose</HI> and longer Sword, flocked hither, under King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. fixing themselves in <HI>London, Norwich, Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Sandwich.</HI> But these con∣fined themselves to their own Church-discipline, and advanced not forward by <HI>Eminent Matches</HI> into our Nation. Yet I behold the worthy Family of <HI>de la Fountain</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> as of <HI>Belgian</HI> original, and have read how the Ancestors of Sir <HI>Simond D'us</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> came hither under King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. from the <HI>Dunasti</HI> or <HI>D'us</HI> in <HI>Gelderland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho their King <HI>Philip</HI> match∣ed with our Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> yet few of any Eminence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>now extant (if I well remember) derive their Pe∣digrees from them; by reason of their short Reign and the ensuing Change of Religions. Probable it is we might have had more Natives of that Kingdom to have setled and flourished in our Nation, had he
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
obtained a Marriage with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as he de∣sired.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> few have fixed their Habitations here, yet is the want of the Number of these abun∣dantly supplyed with the Transcendent Quality and most Noble Vertues of our gracious Queen, who as <HI>Cynthia,</HI> dispenses her <HI>Royal Influence</HI> to the lesser Stars, and Strikes with <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Veneration</HI> the <HI>Hearts</HI> of all. The <HI>May</HI>'s (who have been Sheriffs in <HI>Sus∣sex,)</HI> are of the <HI>Portugal Race.</HI></P>
<P>Come we now to the <HI>second Division</HI> of our <HI>Gen∣try,</HI> according to the <HI>Professions</HI> whereby they have been advanced. And, Note, such Professions found most of them Gentlemen, being the <HI>(younger)</HI> Sons of Wealthy Fathers, able to give them liberal Edu∣cation. Their <HI>Blood</HI> lighted them, and their <HI>Professi∣on</HI> set them up in a <HI>higher Candlestick,</HI> making a Conspicuous Accession of <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Dignity.</HI> Thus all behold <HI>Isis</HI> encreased in <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> after it's Conjunction with <HI>Thame</HI> at <HI>Dorcester,</HI> whilst few take notice of the <HI>first Fountain</HI> thereof many Miles more Westward in <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI> The Study of the <HI>Common-Law</HI> hath advanced very Ancient Fami∣lies in <HI>England.</HI> It seems they purchased <HI>good Titles,</HI> made <HI>sure Settlements,</HI> and entail'd <HI>Thrift</HI> with their Lands, on their Posterity. Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> hath prevented my Pains, and given in a List of such Prin∣cipal Families. 'Tis admirable, that there is not a great and Numerous House in <HI>England,</HI> wherein there is not one, Anciently or at this day Living, thriving and flourishing, by the <HI>Study</HI> of the <HI>Law.</HI> Especially if to them be added those who have rais∣ed themselves in Courts of Judicature.</P>
<P>The City hath produced more then the Law in Number, and some as broad in <HI>Wealth,</HI> but not so high in <HI>Honour</HI> nor long lasting in time, who like
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
Landfloods, soon come, and soon gone, have been dry∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up before this Generation. Yet many of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ave continued in a certain Channel, and carried a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>onstant Stream.</P>
<P>The Church before the <HI>Reformation,</HI> advanced many Families. For tho Bishops might not marry, they preferred their <HI>Brothers Sons</HI> to great Estates, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s the <HI>Kemps</HI> in <HI>Kent, Peckhams</HI> in <HI>Sussex, Wickhams</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hampshire, Meltons</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Reformation, some have raised their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>amilies to a Knightly and Worshipful Estate, as <HI>Hutton, Bilson, Dove, Neil,</HI> &amp;c. For <HI>Sheriffs, San∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ys</HI> in <HI>Worcester</HI> &amp; <HI>Cambridgeshire, Westphaling</HI> in <HI>Here∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rdshire, Elmar</HI> in <HI>Suffolk, Rud</HI> in <HI>Carmarthenshire.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>inferiour Clergy, Robert Johnson</HI> attain'd such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n Estate, that his <HI>Grandson</HI> was Pricked Sheriff <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>f a County, but declined the place as being a Deacon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Civil Law</HI> hath preferred few. The most Eminent in that Faculty before the Reformation be∣ing Persons in Orders abstained from Marriage; since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>he Reformation, there are Worshipful Families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aised thereby.

<P><HI>SOmmerset-shire</HI> hath the <HI>Severn Sea</HI> on the North, <HI>Glocester-shire</HI> on the North East, <HI>Wilt-shire</HI> on the East, <HI>Dorset-shire</HI> on the South, and <HI>Devon∣shire</HI> on the West; It is named from <HI>Sommerton</HI> the most ancient Town in the County. It reacheth from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI> 55, and from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South</HI> 42 Miles. It is generally Fruitful. 'Tis said there are several single Acres in this Shire, which may serve a good round Family with Bread for a Year, as affording a Bushel of <HI>Wheat</HI> for every Week therein. There is plenty of the best <HI>Lead,</HI> (for Shot) digged out of <HI>Myn∣dyp-Hills,</HI> by the benefit whereof vast sums of Money were advanced to the Bishops of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> since the latter end of the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> Bishop <HI>Still</HI> having had the Harvest, Bishop <HI>Montague</HI> the Gleanings, and Bishop <HI>Lake</HI> the Stubble thereof, and yet considerable was the profit of Lead to him and his Successors. In <HI>Myndip-Hills</HI> there is also found plenty of <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> (good for clearing of the sight) which mixed with Copper, doth make Brafs, and yet is not worth above six pence in the pound. It was dis∣covered about the time when Copper-Mines were re∣discovered in <HI>Cumberland.</HI> The best and biggest <HI>Cheese</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> are made at <HI>Chedder</HI> in this County.

Enemies) or modern, as a ground-colour for dying. It greatly impaireth the ground it groweth on. The Gentry and Commonalty of this County are much af∣fected with <HI>Bull-baiting,</HI> for which purpose there are very good Mastiffs, though chiefly useful for necessary defence, as being good <HI>Porters.</HI> Note, Prince <HI>Henry An.</HI> 1602. allowd a pension for the maintenance of a Mastiff which had worsted a Lyon, and gave Order, <HI>That he that had fought with the King of Beasts, should never after encounter any inferiour Creatures.</HI> When 100 Mastiffs were sent from <HI>England</HI> to the Pope, a Cardinal hearing the Letter read, mistook the <HI>Latin Molossos</HI> for so many <HI>Mules;</HI> yet since that word does almost sound <HI>Mule-asses,</HI> you may imagine the Cardi∣nal had neither good <HI>Latine</HI> nor <HI>English,</HI> in not laying his <HI>Bull</HI> equally on both the kinds of these Beasts of burden. The Manufactures here are <HI>Taunton Serges,</HI> which were much sent into <HI>Spain</HI> before the <HI>Civil War.</HI> As for Buildings, the Churches of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI> are most eminent, and constitute one See. The Church of <HI>Bath</HI> was begun by <HI>Oliver King,</HI> Bishop of this Di∣ocess in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. and the <HI>West</HI> end most curiously Cut, and Carved with <HI>Angels</HI> on <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Lad∣der. After his decease it stood a long time neglected, whence these Verses were written on the Church-wall with a Charcoal,</P>
<Q><L><HI>O Church I wail thy woful plight</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whom</HI> King, <HI>nor</HI> Cardinal, Clark <HI>or</HI> Knight</L>

<P>Alluding to the aforesaid Bishop <HI>King,</HI> and his 4 Suc∣cessors in 35 years, <HI>viz.</HI> Card. <HI>Woolsey,</HI> Card. <HI>Adrian,</HI> Bishop <HI>Clark</HI> and Bishop <HI>Knight.</HI> It felt the Hammers which knocked down the Abbeys. The Townsmen were not willing to buy the Church so cheap as 500
<PB N="741" REF="235"/>
Marks (as it was proffered by the Commissioners) fearing to be thought to couzen the King, so that the purchase might come under the compass of concealed Lands. Hereupon the Glass, Iron, Bells and Lead, (which last amounted to 480 Tun) provided for the finishing thereof, were sold and sent beyond the Sea, and (as some say) lost by shipwrack. In the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Collections were made all over the Land, for the repairing thereof, though they proved incon∣siderable: Only Mr. <HI>Billet,</HI> who was <HI>(I</HI> think) Ex∣ecutor to <HI>W. Cecil</HI> Lord <HI>Burleigh,</HI> disbursed good sums to that end. A Stranger wrote on this Structure,</P>

<P>The parcel Popish Author (who subscribed himself <HI>Cassadore)</HI> expected the finishing of this Church at the return of their Religion, and lookt for this after the Reigns of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>Edw.</HI> 6.

The parable of <HI>Jotham,</HI> (the name of the first Founder,) <HI>Judg.</HI> 9. 8. is most curiously wrought in this Church. When <HI>Oliver</HI> the Usurper was Commander in chief in this Land, some beheld him as the <HI>Olive,</HI> (mentioned in the Parable) till he was once blasted Root and Branches. The Ca∣thedral of <HI>Wells</HI> is greater, and darker then the other, so that <HI>Bath</HI> may seem to <HI>draw</HI> Devotion with the <HI>plea∣santness, Wells</HI> to <HI>drive</HI> it with the <HI>solemnity</HI> thereof.

<P>As for Medicinal Waters, <HI>Bath</HI> is well known, the Waters whereof have much <HI>Bitumen,</HI> soveraign against Obstructions, <HI>Niter,</HI> which strengthneth the operation of the former, and Purgeth the Body of gross Hu∣mours, and <HI>Sulphur</HI> which dries, and is good for uterine effects.

in several Martyrs, <HI>frowning</HI> in <HI>stern Hooper, weeping</HI> in <HI>meek Bradford,</HI> and <HI>smiling</HI> constantly in pleasant <HI>Taylor.</HI> Indeed some have censured his merry conceits as trespassing on the gravity of his calling, especially when just before death. But sure such <HI>Romanists</HI> who admire the temper of Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> jesting with the Axe of the Executioner will excuse our <HI>Taylor,</HI> for making himself merry with the <HI>Stake.</HI> But though it be <HI>ill jesting with edged Tools</HI> (whereof death is the <HI>sharpest)</HI> yet since our <HI>Saviour</HI> hath <HI>blunted</HI> it, his Ser∣vants may rather be <HI>delighted</HI> then <HI>dismayed</HI> with it. Not long after, Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> set Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer</HI> (his Patron) a <HI>Copy of Patience,</HI> who indeed wrote af∣ter it, but not with so <HI>steady a hand,</HI> and so even a <HI>Character of Constancy.

<P><HI>Rob. Samuel,</HI> Minister of <HI>Barfold</HI> in this County, was tortured in Prison by the cruelty of <HI>Hopton</HI> Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and <HI>Downing</HI> his Chancellour, who allowed him every day but three <HI>Mouthfuls of Bread,</HI> and three <HI>Spoonfuls</HI> of <HI>Water.</HI> Fain would he have drunk his own Urine, but his Thrist-parched Body afforded none. I read how he saw a Vision of one all in White, com∣forting and telling him, that <HI>after that day, he never should be hungry or thirsty,</HI> which came to pass accord∣ingly, being within few hours after Martyred at <HI>Ips∣wich, August</HI> 31. 1555. There was a Report that his Body when burnt, did shine as bright as burnished Sil∣ver. Some may possibly impute his <HI>Vision,</HI> and this <HI>Appearance,</HI> the first to his own, and the latter to the Beholders Imaginations, or both to the <HI>forgery</HI> of those who were more remote and unconcerned. If to Ima∣gination; it is a plain Concession of the matter of Fact in <HI>both,</HI> and consequently, a granting of all such things which can be reasonably proved therein. The Argu∣ment I shall use to prove that his Vision was superna∣tural, shall be drawn from the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of the contra∣ry
<PB N="776" REF="254"/>
Opinion; For since <HI>Samuel</HI> was reduced (as afore∣said) to extream weakness, his Body being parched, his Humours fixed, and his Spirits exhausted, it is im∣possible that his languishing <HI>Phantasie</HI> should either produce or receive so bright an <HI>Idaea,</HI> without the su∣pernatural Assistance of Divine Power. As for the appearance of his Body when burnt; I will suppose, <HI>(salvo jure Omnipotentiae,)</HI> that some good Christians who beheld his last Suffering, did by an Heroick act of <HI>Faith,</HI> antedate the glorious State of a Future Re∣surrection: And as <HI>Sea ware</HI> or mud is sometimes found in the Net, or on the Line, after the <HI>Fish</HI> is catch'd, so they, having stretched out the <HI>hand</HI> of Faith for ap∣prehending of a <HI>Christian verity,</HI> might together with the same, receive an erroneous imagination, upon the (then) present occasion. After all, if both instances be charged with subsequent Forgery, as to the matter of Fact, I shall not insist any longer on them, as not being so proveable by others as they are probable in them∣selves.</P>

<P>THIS <HI>Principality</HI> hath the <HI>Severn-Sea</HI> on the South, <HI>Irish Ocean</HI> on the West and North, <HI>England</HI> on the East, divided by a <HI>Ditch,</HI> drawn from the Mouth of <HI>Dee</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Wie.</HI> From <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI> it is 100, and from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South</HI> 120 Miles. The foresaid <HI>Ditch</HI> is called <HI>Claudh-Offa,</HI> because made by King <HI>Offa,</HI> who Enacted, that what <HI>Welsh-man</HI> soever was found on the <HI>East</HI> side of this <HI>Ditch,</HI> should forfeit his Right Hand, a Law long since Cancelled. And the <HI>Loyal</HI> and <HI>Valiant Welsh</HI> have for many Ages past enjoyed the same Priviledges with o∣ther Subjects of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was divided into three parts by <HI>Roderick</HI> the Great, about the year 877. and allotted to his three Sons.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>This Division proved the Confusion of <HI>Wales,</HI> whose Princes were always at War, not only against the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> but mutually with themselves, to enlarge and de∣fend their Dominions. Of these <HI>Three, North-Wales</HI> was the Chief, being left to <HI>Mervin</HI> eldest Son to <HI>Ro∣derick</HI> aforesaid; the <HI>Princes</HI> whereof (by way of <HI>E∣minency,</HI> were stiled the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> and some∣times Kings of <HI>Aberfrow)</HI> paid to the King of <HI>London,</HI> yearly 63 pounds, by way of Tribute, the same sum being like wise paid to the said King, by the Princes of <HI>Powis</HI> and <HI>South-Wales.</HI> However <HI>South-Wales</HI> (called by the Natives <HI>Deheubarth, i. e.</HI> the <HI>Right-side,</HI> be∣cause nearer the Sun) was of the <HI>three,</HI> the largest, richest, and most fruitful; But this Country being con∣stantly infested with the Invasions of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Flemings,</HI> had <HI>North-Wales</HI> preferred before it, as more entire, and better secured from such Annoyances. Hence it is that the <HI>Welsh-Tongue</HI> retaineth the purity thereof only in <HI>North-Wales.</HI> The Soil mostly rising up into Hills and Mountains, is of a lean and hungry Nature; yet is the ill quality recompenced by the good quanti∣ty thereof; Whence it was that a Worshipful Knight in <HI>Wales,</HI> who had a fair Estate therein, said to an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Gentleman, (who bragged that he had in <HI>England</HI> so much Ground, worth 40 Shillings an <HI>Acre,) You have</HI> 10 <HI>yards of Velvet, and I have</HI> 200 <HI>of Frize, I will not exchange with you.</HI> However there are in <HI>Wales</HI> most pleasant Meadows along the sides of Rivers; and as the sweetest Flesh is said to be nearest the Bones, so most delicious Vallies are interposed betwixt these Mountains. The Inhabitants are Healthful, Strong,

Swift and Witty, which is imputed to the clear and wholsome Air of the Mountains, the cleanly and mode∣rate Diet of the people, and the hardness whereunto they are inured from their infancy.</P>
<P>Of Natural Commodities, there is <HI>Silver,</HI> whereof <HI>Cardigan-shire</HI> yields <HI>Royal Mines;</HI> in these Mountains, <HI>viz. Comsomelock, Tallabant, Gadarren, Bromfloid, Geginnon,</HI> and <HI>Cummerrum.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> began to Mine here, (as appears by their Coynes found therein) working in Trenches, (about 24 Fathom deep) and found plenty of Lead. The <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> wrought 100 Fathom deep, and found great plenty of the same, till their Works were drown'd with water. Customer <HI>Smith,</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> dis∣covered Silver in <HI>Comsomelock:</HI> After his death the de∣sign was prosecuted, and more perfected by Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI> Knight, Coyning the Silver to his great Charge, (as his Predecessor had done) at the Tower; After whose death, Sir <HI>Francis Godolphin</HI> of <HI>Cornwal</HI> Knight, and <HI>Thomas Bushel</HI> Esquire, undertook the Work. King <HI>Charles</HI> I. granted to them power of Coinage at <HI>Aberrusky,</HI> in that County. <HI>Thomas Bushel</HI> (Sir <HI>Francis</HI> dying, and <HI>Comsomelock</HI> being deserted) adventured on the other <HI>five</HI> Mountains, and at last these Mines yielded 100 pounds a Week, (besides Lead amounting to half as much) Coyned at <HI>Aberrusky</HI> aforesaid. The Pence, Groats, Shillings, Half-Crowns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of this Silver, had the <HI>Ostrich Feathers</HI> (the Arms of <HI>Wales)</HI> stamped on them. The Civil Wars dis∣composed all the Work. I will add no more, but on∣ly make mention of that ingenious invention, where∣by the Miners are supplyed with fresh Air: This is done by <HI>two</HI> Mens blowing wind with a pair of Bel∣lows, on the outside of <HI>Adit,</HI> into a Pipe of Lead, dai∣ly lengthned as the Mine is made longer, whereby the Candle in the Mine is daily kept burning, and the dig∣gers

recruited constantly with a sufficiency of breath. There is <HI>Lead</HI> found in many places of <HI>Wales,</HI> but in <HI>Carnarvan-shire</HI> the best. Plenty of <HI>Goats</HI> are bred here, especially in <HI>Montgomery-shire.</HI> As for Manu∣factures, the <HI>British</HI> generally bearing themselves high, on the account of their gentile extraction, are better pleased in the employment of their <HI>Valour</HI> then <HI>La∣bour,</HI> and therefore there are only those few that follow, <HI>Frieze,</HI> of which <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> having a Suit, and being checkt by a bold Courtier for wear∣ing the same many Weeks together, <HI>Would</HI> (said he) <HI>that the Cloth of my Country would last alwayes.</HI> Then Cheese, very tender and palatable, the Pedigree where∣of was by one, merrily derived, thus,</P>

<PB N="970" REF="353"/>
in Exile in <HI>France,</HI> where he contracted a permanent habit of Frugality. Having vanquished King <HI>Richard</HI> 3. in <HI>Bosworth-field,</HI> and Married <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> eldest Daugh∣ter to King <HI>Edward</HI> 4. He Reigned King of <HI>England</HI> by the name of <HI>Henry</HI> 7. He is generally conceived a most politick Prince; yet many think his judgment failed him, when refusing the proffer of <HI>Columbus,</HI> for discovering of <HI>America;</HI> but such his wariness, he would not tamper with costly Contingencies. He was the first King who secretly sought to abate the formidable greatness (the Parent of many former <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Rebellions) in the <HI>English</HI> Peerage. Hereby he taught the Commons to claim <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> by the name of <HI>Priviledge,</HI> and made them able in time to contest with Sovereignty. He survived his <HI>Queen,</HI> by whom he had the best Title to the Crown, about five years. His greatest fault was, grinding his Sub∣jects with grievous exactions. He was most Magni∣ficent in those Structures he left to Posterity; amongst which, his Devotion to <HI>God,</HI> is seen in <HI>two</HI> Chappels, the one at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the other at <HI>Westminster;</HI> His Charity to the poor in the Hospital of the <HI>Savoy,</HI> his Magnificence to himself in his own Monument of guilded Copper, and his vanity to the World, in building a Ship called the <HI>Great Harry,</HI> of equal cost say some, with his Chappel, which soon after sunk into the Sea. He much employed Bishops in his ser∣vice, finding them honest and able. He deceased at <HI>Richmond, April</HI> 22. 1509. and was buried in his Magnificent Chappel at <HI>Westminster,</HI> having prohibi∣ted by his Will, the Interment of any person or persons whatsoever therein, save those of the <HI>Royal Blood.</HI></P>

Having Travelled to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he wrote <HI>De Mirabilibus Terrae Sanctae.</HI> Having had ill success at Court, he attained to no considerable Dig∣nity. For a long time no preferment was proffered him, above a beggarly Bishoprick in <HI>Ireland:</HI> At last, the See of St. <HI>David</HI> was the highest place he attained. <HI>Giraldus</HI> himself tells us the true reason thereof, that he was ever beheld <HI>oculo novercali,</HI> because being a <HI>Welshman by the surer side,</HI> and then such the antipa∣thy

<P><HI>RAdnor-shire,</HI> (in British <HI>Sire Maiseveth)</HI> in form three square, is bounded on the North-West with <HI>Hereford-shire,</HI> and on the South (separated by the River <HI>Wye)</HI> with <HI>Brecknock-shire,</HI> and on the North with <HI>Montgomery-shire.</HI> Nature may seem to have chequered this County, the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>South</HI> parts there∣of being fruitful, whilst the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West</HI> thereof (being Mountainous) can hardly be bettered by Hus∣bandry; Yet it is indifferently stored with Woods, and conveniently watered with Rivers and Meers. Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> telleth us, that there is a place therein termed <HI>Melienith,</HI> (from the <HI>yellowish</HI> Mountains thereof) which stretcheth from <HI>Off a Dike</HI> unto the River <HI>Wye,</HI> which cutteth overthwart the <HI>West</HI> corner of this Shire, where meeting with some stones which impede its motion on a sudden, for want of ground to glide on, hath a vio∣lent downfal, which place is termed <HI>Raihader Gowy,</HI> that is the <HI>Fall of Wye.</HI> Hereupon he supposeth it not improbable, that the <HI>Englishmen</HI> forged that word for the name of this Shire, terming it <HI>Radnor-shire.</HI></P>
