<HEAD>Remarks on the Observations, OFFER'D <HI>By a True English-Man, <HI>Who is not a</HI></HI> SAILOR, <HI>tho' of Long Service in the</HI> NAVY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Title Demonstrates the Author to be no <HI>English-man,</HI> or not to have observed, That an <HI>English</HI>-Sailor, not Saile'r, writ that Paper, Reflecting (as he terms it) on the Admiralty; but however he may have been Concerned; his Carping at filthy Springs from impure Fountains, cannot justify the Admiralty which he makes the Fountain; for as <HI>Omne Simile Claudicat,</HI> so doth his Com∣parison, that pure Waters lose their Virtues by the Channels they flow thro'; except he would have the unalterable Or∣ders, issued from that formerly important Office, to be sub∣jected to the imprudent or ill Management of those Com∣missionated by it: This he may be assured of, the old Fe∣males of <HI>Wapping,</HI> would not have suffered their Servants to commit Faults, without Reproof and Punishment; whereas this Author would have the Commissioners of the Admiralty to do so, And how justly the Sea-men living there, complain of the Commissioners of the Admiralties Dealings with them, the Author might be judge of, would he hear them, which he knows the Lords of the Admiralty will not, to the First's great Sorrow, and the Latters ever-lasting Infamy.</P>
<P>How ignorant soever we may be what King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Sea-Commanders might have been, the Office of Lord High Ad∣miral of <HI>England</HI> is well known, and hath, in the Memory of Man been well Executed, in Comparison of what hath been in the late War, or since the present Peace; and that the Mismanagements complained of, have proceeded from the Qualifications of the Gentlemen that Compose that Board, is but too evident; Witness the Breach of the Fundamental Constitution of the <HI>English</HI> Government, in the Disobeying our most Gracious King's Commands, signified by the Lord
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> then Secretary of State, Ordering a Squadron of Ships to be sent to meet Sir <HI>George Rooke,</HI> Re∣turning from <HI>Cadiz;</HI> to enable him to intercept the <HI>Thoulon</HI>-Fleet, under pretence of a Verbal Contradictory Order. And how can any Fleet secure <HI>England,</HI> when it is under the Command of those that did not punish Captain <HI>Norris,</HI> for not Attacking of <HI>Poine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> when at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> upon Cap∣tain <HI>Scomberbacks</HI> Intelligence, since they thought fit to Re∣ward the latter with Five hundred Pounds, and a Chain and Medal. It is true, that the want of the Experience of such Manifest Miscarriages as have happened in the Nine Years War may be happy for the Nation, but except those that are known Guilty of them be punished for Exam∣ple; others, 'tis possible will unadvisedly fall into the same Errors.</P>
<P>It is not desired, That the Length of Service should be a reason to Displace any Man in Office, but surely continu∣ed Disservice to their Country and Prince calls for deserved Punishment, and then 'twould be easy to name a sett of Gen∣tlemen that will Faithfully serve the Publick, and render the Admiralty a Renowned, not <HI>An unlucky Office,</HI> an <HI>Epethite</HI> no <HI>Englishman</HI> can give to it; however, it may be given to those that Execute it, whose Services must be forgotten, since not known, and their Crimes ought to be remembred, since they are so evident, and plainly proved every Day.</P>
<P>The Hardships done to the Seamen in Turning them over from one Ship to another, I dare boldly affirm hath been the occasion of our want of Men; and without a greater Re∣gard be had to do them Justice, both in Pay and Treatment, the Number of the Disobliged must Encrease; and who doth not wish Ease and Advantage to the Seamen, can be no Friend to the Government.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Let the Cruising Captains, in the time of our Grand Fleets being in the Streights be ask'd, <HI>How they were provided with Wine,</HI> and it will appear the Sailors drank Wa∣ter, without ever having their due Allowance for the Wine they should have had, which can be proved; tho' I suppose the Author of the Observations is ignorant thereof.</P>
