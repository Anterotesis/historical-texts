<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter my Love to thee and thy wife, and the rest of my beloved Friends in the Truth, in the which, as we abide, we are a Flock; yea, we are a pure Family of Love, the Houshold and Children of the living God, in whom he will be glorifi'd, in carrying of his Lambs and Babes in the Arms and Ark of his everlasting power, over all the swelling and raging Waves of the Enemy, both within and without; to the joy of all his Faithful ones; and to the Glory and Renown of his holy Name, who over all in Hea∣ven and Earth, and every where is blessed for ever and ever more.</P>
<P>Dear Frind,<LB/> I Comeing to Town, and hearing of <HI>John Walley</HI> (him by whom thou hast sent to me) who being just ready to Sail for <HI>London,</HI> could not omit to write these few lines unto thee: But my business to <HI>Boston</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this time was to build up something over our) never to forgotten) Friends Graves, whom the Apostate Professors of <HI>New-England</HI> had hanged on a Tree, and buryed neer the Countreys High∣way side; the Lord having put it into my heart, that now was a fit and seasonable time, it being a day of great Calamity and distress up∣on most part of <HI>New-England;</HI> For the Natives are risen in great wrath and fury against the <HI>English,</HI> breaking in upon many places with fireing of Houses, and torturing of sundry persons with several sorts of Tortures: And it is reported they hang up some alive in Iron Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks, by the under Jaw untill Death, burying some alive by de∣grees,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>and Skinning others alive. And some they carry away it is not known whither, but it is thought to Torture them after the most horrid ways they can invent; and here are great busles in Pressing Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sending out to War. But the <HI>Indians</HI> (as a Scourge in the hand o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord) goe on with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lty and success, upbraiding and c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llenging the <HI>English</HI> Warr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers when they see them, and saying, <HI>Come, why do ye not fight?</HI> So that in a little time they have much sur∣prized, and made great slaughters upon the <HI>English:</HI> and although they had great store of Ammunition of their own, yet they get much more by Rifling of Houses, and Slaughtering Souldiers out of the Thick∣ets and Swamps, as they March and Travel along the Woods. They lately met with a Captain and his Company as they were passing o∣ver a Swamp; and at one Volley of Shot slew him, and neer all his Company. The <HI>Indians,</HI> I hear, insult very much, and tell the <HI>English</HI> Warriers that God is against them, and for the <HI>Indians;</HI> and that the <HI>English</HI> shall (for their Unrighteousness) fall into their hands. Our Rulers, Officers, and Councellors are like as men in a maze, not knowing what to do: but the Priests spur them on, telling them the <HI>Indians</HI> are ordained for destruction; bidding them go forth to Warr, and they will Fast and Pray at home in the mean time: yet their Gene∣ral, with some other Officers, complain and say, with tears, They see not God go along with them. And many of the <HI>English,</HI> when the Natives have killed them, they strip them naked, and leave their bo∣dies to rot upon the ground. I heard some of the <HI>Indians</HI> did say to some <HI>Englishmen,</HI> That they did not think the <HI>Quakers</HI> would come out against them: I have not yet heard of much hurt they have done to Friends; but it is likely to be a time of great tryal to all here.</P>
<P>What I had to get upon our Friends Graves being ready framed a∣forehand, I got two Friends to help me to set it up in the night, a Court of Guard being kept very neer; but it being pretty dark, we did our work without interruption; so next day, pretty early, tiding was brought into Town, that there was a Tombe built upon the two <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> Grave by the Gallows; and it being a Market day, it is said, ma∣ny hundreds, of Town and Country, flock'd about it, Reading, taking, and giving Copeys of the Inscription which was Engraven upon the Front end of the Work: And much people were seriously affected, say∣ing, one to another, that the destroying of those good people, is that which hath brought the Displeasure and Judgment of the Lord upon this Countrey: But the Priests and Rulers, it being General Court time, hearing of it, and the great Concourse of people which gathered
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>about it, in the evening, it being the last day of the week, they sent some to pull it in pieces, and to bring the Table, with the Inscription, to the Governour, and General Court. When it was Demollished, divers people, who afterwards came from divers Towns to see it, lost their labours. But notwithstanding the rage of the Enemy, it hath pro∣ved very good service, and to the torment of the blood guilty; and it riseth in the hearts of many people afresh. So, my Dear Friend, with true Love, I Rest,</P>

<SALUTE>My well beloved Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the remembrance of true Love to the, and the rest of dear Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This may inform thee, that a most bitter Spirit is entred the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> in which they greatly endea∣vour the utter destruction one of another: so that the Face of the state and condition of this Country, to all that sees, seems very sad, and dolesome; and the fearful day of Gods most righteous Judge∣ments according to his unchangeable Word, spoken by his faithful Servants, and Prophets, seems now, like a mighty and terrible one, to come upon this wicked, and adulterated Place, and People: and al∣though they do fast, and pray often, yet still stands in them, fast root∣ed, the evil Tree, and they still delight to smite with the Fist of wickedness, even all them who faithfully reprove Iniquity in the gate; and their evil hearts are much hardned So that, although Plagues, and Perplexities come in upon them, like an overflowing Stream, yet their wise <HI>Achitophels</HI> feed themselves fat, without fear, as for a day of slaughter, whilst many of our miserable Inhabitants lye naked, wallowing in their blood, and dying; and whilst the Bar∣barous enraged Natives, from one part of the Country, to another, are on Fire, flaming forth their fury, spoiling Cattle and Corn,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>and burning Houses, and torturing Men, Women, and Children; anf burning them alive. Yesterday came news to mine Ear, that a few Miles off, the <HI>Indians</HI> came to a House, and catch'd a Child of half a Year old, from its Mother, and another about ten Years old; both which they carried to the other side of a River, where they made a Fire; and in sight of the tender Mother, they took up the youngest by one Leg, and held it aloft, and said, see you, <HI>English</HI> Woman, (or to that purpose) and so threw it into the Fire, and burnt it; and so it's supposed, they destroytd the other also. I this day heard of one whom they were three days torturing to death; so it plainly appears <HI>New-Englands</HI> unparalel'd day is now come upon themselves. Divers of the Priests (I heard) gathered together to consider what might be the cause that the Hand of the Lord is thus stretched forth against them: and one of them said, there seems to be a thick Cloud between the Lord and our Prayers, and the Lord goes not forth with our For∣ces; but on the very days that we Fast, and Pray before the Lord, do our Enemies give us the greatest overthrows; and the last time we Fasted, we had the greatest slaughter; and some confessed that the greatest cause might be in the Priests, but they would not all agree to that; so <HI>Babylon</HI> was, and is divided. One of their Priests, on a Fast day, took his Text out of the <HI>44th</HI> Psalm, beginning at the <HI>9th.</HI> Verse, and read to the <HI>14th.</HI> but Preached on the <HI>9th. But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our Armies.</HI> Verse 10. <HI>Thou makest us to turn back from the Enemy; and they which hat us, spoil us for themselves.</HI> Verse 11. <HI>Thou hast given us like Sheep appointed for Meat, and hast scattered us among the Heathen</HI> Verse 12. <HI>Thou sellest thy Peo∣ple for nought, and dost not encrease thy Wealth by their Peace.</HI> Verse 13. <HI>Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st us a reproach to our Neighbours, a scorn, and a Division to them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are round about us.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> Insult very much over our <HI>English</HI> Forces, Challenging them out to right: you say, say they, you will kill all the <HI>Indians;</HI> why come you not forth to fight? Sometimes they watch the <HI>English,</HI> and will not suffer them to bury their flain, but force them to flee before them; and then return, and strip the flain naked, and leave their Bo∣dies to rot above ground: now these things are come to pass, as was foretold by our Friends, the Servants of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord. A few days since, a Man, who had gotten one of <HI>George Bishop's</HI> Books of Friends suffer∣ings in <HI>New England,</HI> and reading a saying there, wherein he testi∣fied the days should shortly come, that great Calamities should come upon that People; and that their Young Men should fall by the Sword,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>and Worms shall cover them; and the Cup which they had filled to to others, should be filled double to themselves: This Man being press'd in Spirit, went to the General Court, then sitting, with <HI>George Bishop's</HI> Book in his hand; and came several Miles out of the Coun∣try: he told them he could not have rest in his mind, until he came to shew them that Book; and he delivered it to them, bidding them read such a place, and consider if he was not a true Prophet from the Lord, in what he had foretold; and whether it was not now come to pass: But they frowned hard upon him, and examined him if he went to the Publique Worship, or nay; whereupon he demanded his Book again, but went away without it. Some of the Priests do endeavour to charm the minds of the People, and to perswade them that the cause of these distresses, fears, and horrors, that is come upon them in their lying down, and rising up, is for that the Magistrates do suffer the Quakers, and other Hereticks to live amongst them; but others of them, tell the People in their Pulpits, that the great cause of Gods sore displeasure against them, is the guilt of innocent blood, which from time to time, hath been shed in the Land; and father said, that al∣though the Lord had this Year taken away the Plague of Blasting the Wheat in the Field, yet a greater Plague hath he brought in its room; and if thus it doth continue, greater Plagues than these are like to en∣sue the next Year, even Pestilence, and Famine, with the Sword. Great is the Policy, and Wisdome the Natives do Act withal; for they compass the out-sides, and weakest Towns in the Country; and gather the People, and drives of them in heaps, like Fishes before a Net and make them fly before them to the strongest Towns for Refuge; and say, they will drive them down to <HI>Boston,</HI> and to two or three more of their strongest Towns, where they, for want, shall starve, and famish one another, and at present (if the Lord shew not mercy) they seem as if they would destroy, and roul up the rest of our Nation, as a burdensome, and menstruous Cloth, and cast it out of their Land; but blessed shall every one be that fears, and follows the Lord with an upright heart; for such he will make as a Wall of Brass, and he will be their deliverer, and their strong Tower, henceforth and for ever more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
