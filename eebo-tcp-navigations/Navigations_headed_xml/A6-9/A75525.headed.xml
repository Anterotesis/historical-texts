<P>THe Papists have often made bould adven∣tures to shew their malicious and spleniall intents, towards the Protestants, but al∣wayes covering them with a vayle, that their trea∣cheries might be concealed, and not appeare, whereby they might incurre the punishment due to their politicall designes, but the all seeing eye of the Almighty knowes the hearts, and he dis∣cryes the ill meaning adversary unto his people, as will appeare by the Sequell.</P>
<P>On the six and twenteth of <HI>February</HI> last, the wind and weather being extreame foule there was beaten in upon the the Roads of <HI>Tarmouth</HI> divers shipps loaden with wines, amongest the rest one of them was a French shipp called the <HI>Olive</HI> bow which was heavie laden and the men therof seem∣ing rather Soldiers, then sea men which giveing iust occation of suspition to the countrie, they forth with offered to search the Shipp but being denyed the ame with out a Commission to that effect, it was left undone for that time, with in two dayes after the said Shipp set to Sea, which

<HEAD>THE True relation of a terrible Sea-fight by the States of <HI>Holland</HI> against a Fleet of Spanish being furnished with men, munition, for assistance to the Rebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe griefes and troubles of a diseased Kingdome, does not alwayes consist invy domestick or civill commotions, neither doe the distrsses thereof appeare in all places alike, the friends of a state if perpetually, nourisht in it's breast must needs incurre the feare and iust appre∣hension of forraigne dangers, without some freind∣ly informations. I must confesse that the viperous brood of Malignants, are so superfluously plenti∣full, that it would be no news to nominate thou∣sands, on whom such a deserved aspersion, might iustly be imposed, nay how is the world of late termed to such a relictancy from united opinions that their cannot be a motion though never so good and beneficiall to a King or State, but soone it finds many both malivolent and potent enemies to suppresse their good endeavours. The Master
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>must be beholding to his servant for the perfor∣mance of his bounden duty, the tenant will not pay his Landlord rent (though due) without ob∣sequious consideration nay there be subiects, that deny their King his power and legall authority, by open and playne rebellions, as that of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have not onely usurped his Maiesties authority but shewed themselves utter and professed ene∣mies to him, their damnable bloody murders committed, and dayly prosecuted against his loy∣all Subiects, as also by denying his supremacy a∣mongst them, making religion a cloake to uphold them, as blamelesse in these their pernitious de∣signes, inviting forraigne nations as assistants for their defence against him, turning his former love into open emnity, such are the contents of the newes, I meane to treate on as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>The manner of the meet∣ting of both Fleets, the Battell, and issue thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THe States-men of warre having dayly intelli∣gence of the Spanish intentions, for the ayding of the Irish Rebells, and being chary of the wel∣farre, safety, and honour of the English There was Order given that fifty of their principall Ships should be provided as a guard or victory to over∣see and watch upon the coast of <HI>Flanders</HI> (to repell such forces if any were) of which Collonell <HI>Royston</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>went cheife commander which continued quote∣dially scouring those scas to conceive where any danger might be, for the space of six weeks, all that time the Spanish fearing the worst made no appa∣rition for their intended, But being (as it afterward appeared) continually egged on &amp; perswaded for∣ward by the Rebells to take their enterprise of asi∣stance in hand, they set sayle from <HI>Mourney</HI> neere <HI>Maligo,</HI> with the number of 70.
