<HEAD>A TRUE
RELATION
Of a most Horrid Conspiracy and Running
away with the SHIP
ADVENTURE,
Having on Board <HI>Forty Thousand Pieces of Eight,</HI> and other Goods
to a great Value. Together with the Cruel and Barbarous leaving and turning ashore upon the Island
<HI>Naias,</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> the Captain, and three Merchants which were Passen∣gers,
and Sixteen honest and able Seamen, Eight whereof miserably perished by
Hunger and Hardship, and but Four of the Remainder yet come to <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Together with some short Account of what passed at the Trial and Condemnation
of those who Committed that Fact.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ship <HI>Adventure,</HI> of which <HI>Thomas Gullock</HI> was Commander and <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI>
bound to <HI>Borneo</HI> in <HI>East-India,</HI> broke ground from <HI>Graves-End</HI> on the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>March</HI>
1697/8. and toucht at <HI>Brava</HI> one of the <HI>Cape de Verdy</HI> Islands, and having there got
plenty of Refreshment, Fowls, Hogs, Goats and green Trade, proceeded on their
Voyage, and in the Month of <HI>August</HI> fell in with the Coast of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> went to <HI>Padang</HI> to get
Refreshment for the Ships Company, lay there five days, bought there four Bullocks, Fowls,
Fruit, green Herbs, Potato's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was equally divided to the Ships Company, also about a
Tun and half of Rice, and half a Butt of <HI>Arack,</HI> got one Boat-load of Water, and sail'd thence;
about 20 days after, being by calms and currents driven near <HI>Naias,</HI> an Island inhabited by a
barbarous sort of People who have no Commerce with any <HI>Europeans,</HI> came to an Anchor, the
Captain order'd the Long boat on shoar with empt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cask to fill Water, under the charge of
Mr. <HI>William Hill</HI> his second Mate, with 24 Men well arm'd, with orders that if a Gale of Wind
should spring up, or that they should see any Natives or tracks of them upon the Sand, then im∣mediately
to repair on Board without Water, being in no great want of it, but thought <HI>that</HI>
the best use could be made of the time whilst lying at an Anchor. After the Long-boat was
put off, the Captain was in great perplexity lest the Boats-crew might be destroyed by the
barbarous Natives, therefore went on shoar himself in his Yaul after them, and stay'd at the
watering place, being two or three hundred yards distant from the Boat, until Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> sent
him word the Water-cask were full; the Captain then sent him orders to send the Long-boat
on board with fifteen Men; <HI>Joseph Bradish</HI> Boatswains mate desired Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> to let him have the
Yaul to tow the Long boat off from the shoar, which he agreed to, intending only the Secu∣rity
of the Boat, but they continued to tow much farther than necessary, and then cast off the
Tow-rope, laying the Yauls Head to the shoar, with only two Men as appear'd in her; when
the Long boat was near the Ship, two Men more rose out of the Yauls hull, and then with four
Oars row'd direc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>board the Ship getting bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on board together; then did <HI>Joseph Bradish,
John Lloyd, Thomas Hughs</HI> and others, seize Mr. <HI>Abraham Parrott</HI> the chief Mate, telling him he
was their Prisoner, and the Ship and all that was in her was their own. He asked them what
was the matter, and what they thought would be the end of it? They answered he need not
trouble himself about that, they were for <HI>A short Life and a merry one.</HI> The Conspirators being
immediately arm'd, made themselves Masters of the Ship, cut her Cable, loosed her Sails, and run
away with her, leaving the Captain and 14 Men upon the said Island, exposed to inexpressiable
Miseries and Dangers, not only from the barbarous Natives, but Tygers and other wild Beasts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> without any manner of Provisions, Moneys or Cloaths, except the worst, which they had
on their backs, or any prospect of returning to their Native Country, or indeed of so much as
preserving their Lives.</P>
<P>Soon after the Ship was under Sail, they turn'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Yaul away, and in her five Men, <HI>viz.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Dru Hacker, Rex Kempson, George Reyner, Jona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grizley,</HI> and <HI>Francisco</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> being such
as would not joyn with them in their Villainous Design, not giving them one Bisket Cake,
or any Sustenance, but refused to let them go to their own Chests to put on a Coat, Hat, or
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
Shoes, insomuch that three were turned ashoar without Coats or Hats, and two without Shoes,
and being forced to travel over sharp Rocks, they, with others whose Shoes soon wore out,
had their Feet torn and mangled, and bled in such a miserable manner, that they desired to
lye down and dye there, rather then to have gone on, if the Captain had not over perswa∣ded
them.</P>
<P>The number left in this deplorable state were 16 of their fellow Seamen, with the Comman∣der
and three Merchants, who, besides the extream danger of perishing there, were rob'd of
what they had aboard, frustrated of the fruits of their Voyage, and their poor Wives and
Children left to starve at home. Eight have since perished by hunger and hardships, who, if
they were present, would more livelily set out the horrid Cruelty of those unmerciful Men
who run away with the Ship, and left them in that miserable and wretched Condition.</P>
<P>This distressed Company being thus left, without any thing to eat, did remain so from <HI>Sa∣turday</HI>
morning the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> till <HI>Thursday</HI> evening the <HI>22th.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the Barbarity of their fellow Seamen left them in such unspeakable distress, yet it
pleased God wonderfully to bring about Means for the Preservation of a few of them to be
Witnesses of so horrid a Villany; for there happened to come two Boats to the said Island, which
the Captain did hire with the Promise of 500 Pieces of Eight to pursue his Ship, and was on
<HI>Munday</HI> the <HI>19th</HI> within 4 or 5 Miles of her, but by a sudden Storm was forced ashoar, and both
those Boats staved to pieces, only himself with 5 Men in the Yaul escaped that Ship-wrack.
But it pleased God none of them lost their Lives, but all came by Land to a Creek or Cove,
whither the Captain with much toil and difficulty got in the Yaul; the Number was now
by these <HI>Atcheeners</HI> encreased to 42 Men, and no Boat or Vessel but the Yaul, which could
not carry in the Sea above Eight or Ten. The <HI>Atcheeners</HI> seem'd most afraid of the Natives,
begging the Captain to stand by them, or else the Natives would either kill or make Slaves of
him and them; for they said there was a Boat of <HI>Atcheen</HI> which came there the Year before,
the Men of which the Natives had knockt on the head, and halled the Boat up above High∣water
mark; this Boat was survey'd and found much rent with the Sun, but that the <HI>Malayers</HI>
undertook to stop, and did so, with Moss, Bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whilst the Captain took care to get the
Sail and some other things of one of the wrack'd Boats, and did Launch her that day, (tho'
whilst they were about it they were attack'd by 200 of the Natives, all arm'd with Swords,
Targets, and Launces, who made a fierce onset, but by firing Twelve or Fourteen shot
were put to flight) and with her and the Yaul got off to small Islands call'd <HI>Maroos,</HI> where
they got some Coker Nuts, and from a Boat they met at those Islands got some Rice
which had been wet with Salt water in the same Storm when the two Boats were lost, and
was heated and stank abominably, but was eaten heartily: This Boat pretended to belong to
<HI>Padang,</HI> so that the Captain agreed with the Master for transport to <HI>Padang,</HI> giving the launch'd
Boat to the <HI>Acheeners</HI> in lieu of their two Boats, which was all the Recompence he could
then possibly make them. Going with this Boat toward <HI>Sumatra</HI> they were chased with a
<HI>Malaya</HI> Pirate, who came up with them, but seeing them stand to their Arms bore up round,
and stood away without one word. Coming near <HI>Priaman</HI> there is a Shoal upon which the
<HI>Malayar</HI> ran his Boat; and when the Boat was on ground, the <HI>English-men</HI> all leapt over Board
to go to a dry Spot not far distant, but many had like to have been drown'd by holes in the
Rocks, which dipt them over head and ears, but others who could Swim assisted and got them
safe to the dry Spot. The Captain went on shoar with the Yaul, and begg'd the Assistance of
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Corporal, who sent a Boat with Natives, which brought the Men all off from that
Spot, which not long after was overflown with the Tide, otherwise they must have been
drowned; for the <HI>Malayar,</HI> after they jumpt out, got his Boat off, and went away without stay∣ing
to expect his Freight, for what reason we know not. Two days after they went to <HI>Padang,</HI>
where being ill treated, and labouring under great Want and Sickness, three soon died there.
But it pleased God to raise them up there a Friend indeed, Mr. <HI>Antony Gillis</HI> a Native of <HI>India,</HI>
who pitied their Miseries, relieved their Wants, and (under God) saved their Lives; whose
inexpressible and almost inimitable Charity, extended to the Dead and Living, shrowding the
one, and succouring the other, which is here mention'd to his honour, and in gratitude to him.</P>
<P>The remaining part of this distressed Company got their Passage to <HI>Bencoolen,</HI> whereof one
died by the way, and some remain'd there, of which three more soon died, and it is to be
fear'd several of the rest which staid there are since dead, for only six of the Company pro∣ceeded
to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where, after a languishing Sickness, died one more, <HI>viz. George Rayner,</HI>
from which place the Commander and three more got passage to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The foregoing Account is given, not only by the Commander and poor surviving Seamen,
but was (long before the taking of any of the wicked Crew who run away with the Ship) writ∣ten
from <HI>Padang</HI> in a Letter to the Owners by Mr. <HI>Robert Anby</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ralph Peck,</HI> two Gentle∣men,
who, with some others, were to have staid at <HI>Borneo</HI> to have settled a Factory; which
Letters, with two others from Mr. <HI>Nixon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Parrot</HI> at <HI>Batavia,</HI> may be seen at Mr. <HI>Crowches</HI>
a Bookseller at the Corner of <HI>Popes head-Alley</HI> in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> out of which, for Vindication of the
Commander from the base and unjust Aspersions of his ill usage of the Seamen, the Owners
have permitted the following Paragraphs to be printed with this Narrative.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="3" REF="2"/>
<P>NOW, honoured Sirs, we humbly crave your leave to do our worthy Captain Justice, by
acquainting you of his particular care of the Ships Company, in respect to the health both of their
Souls and Bodies; we never failed of Morning and Evening Prayers in publick upon the Quarter Deck,
when the Weather would permit, our Commander daily endeavouring to suppress all manner of Vice, and
to encourage Vertue. As to the health of their Bodies, he was as tender as a Mother to any that were
sick, daily minding the Doctor of his charge; and when he had fresh Provisions at his own Table, would
ask the Doctor who was sick, and always sent them some. Those that were in health he endeavoured to
keep so, by refreshing twice or thrice a day in bad weather with Drams. In fine, God Almighty knows
our hearts that we speak the truth; he is the most religious, sober, careful and kind Commander that we
knew or heard of ever.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Samuel Nixon Chirurgeon, in his Letter to the Owners from Batavia, Nov. 27th. 1698.
writes thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Do declare that I never saw in any of his Majesty's Ships, or any other where I have been, better
Victuals or Victualling, nor never so much care taken, nor kindness shewn, both toward Soul and
Body, as was by the Commander, both to well and sick; for tho' it pleased God to bless us with so health∣ful
a Passage, that we never had any Man lay down three days together, yet hath the Captain often
circumvented me in sending Broth or other fresh Provisions to sick Men from his own Table, and hath
sundry times ordered Fowls to be kill'd expresly for them only, and hath also several times in the Voyage
given of his Fowls to the whole Ships Company, and never kill'd a Hogg, but a great part was given
them; and the same by his Parsnips, Carrots, Pumkins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> allowing for the sick Men Water grewel
with Fruit, Sugar and Spice, such as I thought fit. Insomuch that I am ready to give Oath, I have
heard them say sundry times, that they never saw so good Victualling, nor a Commander so kind and
careful of his Men.</P>
<P>Also he so husbanded the Brandy allowed for them that they had Drams always when wet, and at the
turning out of the Watches. And the Ships Company drank all Beer until near the Southern Tropick,
and to the Eastward of the Cape, and then Beer and Water to the very last, giving the Seamen some∣times
strong Beer. As for Abuses I never saw any or less striking in any Ship where I have been, the
whole amounting to the punishment of four or five Persons, and that for great Faults, as Thievery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Abraham Parrott</HI> Chief-mate, in his Letter to the Owners, gives the same account of
<HI>Victualling and Punishments, &amp;c.</HI> adding, <HI>That after the Seisure of the Ship it was freely discourst,</HI>
William Griffeth <HI>the Trumpeter had taken upon him to have shot the Captain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And now to return,</HI> to give some Account of the procedure of those who ran away with
the Ship, taken from Three who by force were with them the whole Voyage, and gave Evi∣dence
upon Oath thereof, at their Tryal, <HI>viz. John Westby, Robert Amsden,</HI> and <HI>William Saunders;</HI>
the Captain only giving Evidence that the Prisoners were aboard the Ship when it was run a∣way
withal.</P>
<P>After they had seised the Ship, and turned ashoar the five Persons before-mentioned, they
sailed about 50 Leagues to Sea from the Island, and then turn'd away in the Long Boat Mr. <HI>A∣braham
Parrott</HI> the Chief Mate, <HI>William Whitesides</HI> the Boatswain, and <HI>Richard Heath</HI> Armourer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Note,</HI> These 3 poor Creatures were 23 days at Sea, and had there perish'd if they had not by acci∣dent met a Dutch Ship bound to <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI> who carried them thither.</NOTE>,

<P>This being done, they began to divide the Clothes and Moneys of those whom they had so
left and turn'd ashoar, and some time after divided the Pieces of Eight belonging to the Own∣ers,
weighing to each Man his Proportion by the Stillyards, which came to about Fifteen hun∣dred
Pieces of Eight a Man.</P>
<P>When they came near the Coast of <HI>New-England</HI> they agreed to destroy all the Journals and
Writings aboard, which they did by putting them into a Bagg, and sinking them with Shot,
saying, <HI>They should not rise up against them.</HI></P>
<P>After this, near to <HI>Block-Island,</HI> they disperst themselves into several Sloops, taking with them
their Moneys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were not contented with that, but fired five Guns through the Ships
bottom, and sunk her in deep Water, with the Cloath, Lead, Iron, and other Commodities a∣board;
all which, as well as the Ship, were thereby irrecoverably lost.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding their separating themselves into several distant Parts, <HI>Divine Justice</HI> has pur∣sued
them, and they have all been taken but one, who is suppos'd to be kill'd, and were brought
to their Trial on the <HI>21st</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> where what they said for themselves,
as to the Matter of Fact, was frivolous and inconsistent, but endeavoured to extenuate their
Crime by charging the Commander with Severity and Ill usage, from which the Court was
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
pleased to give the Commander an opportunity to vindicate himself, which he did <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon Oath</HI>
in the manner following, to the Satisfaction of the Court? <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>That he was sorry to see so many Men so remorsless, as to endeavour the excusing one Villany
by committing another, as not content to have rob'd him of his Ship and Cargo, expos'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him∣self
and 19 more to those inexpressible Hardships and Miseries, whereby the King lost eight of
his Subjects by untimely death, and no more than three besides himself return'd to <HI>England,</HI> of
the 20 left on shoar,) but farther endeavoured to Murther his Reputation with most unjust,
and base Aspersions. As for the Victualling of his Ship, he said, that on <HI>Sundays, Tuesdays</HI> and
<HI>Thursdays</HI> they had every Mess a piece of good Beef and a Pudding of two pound and a half of
Flower with ¼ of Suet, besides Butter or Cheese for Breakfast. That on <HI>Mondays</HI> and <HI>Fridays</HI>
they had Pork and Pease, with Breakfast as before: On <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Saturdays</HI> Fish and Bur∣goo;
and they had Burgoo for Breakfast, with Butter and Sugar, on those days. That they
had three Cans of Beer a Mess every day till far beyond the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> and after that
two Cans of good Beer and Water; and when they drank Water, there was a Cask with a
Scuttle or Hole cut at the Bung enough to put a Cup in and drink when they pleas'd, lash'd
fast to the Main-mast upon the Main-deck, fill'd as often as there was occasion. Also
that they had 28 pound of Bread <HI>per</HI> Week every Mess, until <HI>John Lloyd</HI> desired the Cap∣tain
to let him put two bags of Bread about 50 pound each, (which his Mess alone
had saved out of their Allowance) into the Bread-room, which was done accordingly. That
then they were at no Allowance for a Fortnight or three Weeks, but had the Bread in an open
Cask in the Steerage, to eat when and what they pleas'd, until they left it greasie up and down
where they eat, and then 'twas retrencht to 25 pound <HI>per</HI> Week every Mess, and never less by
his order or knowledge. Also that they had Drams Morning and Evening when fair, and as
often as the Watches was chang'd when wet, never letting them go to their Hamocks wet
without a Dram, to be sure of which he did not suffer the Steward to give it them below, but
constantly his own Servant at his Round house door. Also that every Mess had on <HI>Sundays</HI> a
Can of strong Beer; and when about the <HI>Cape</HI> in cold raw weather, they have often had, both
Morning and Evening, Burgoo, and sometimes Fowls for the whole Ships Company<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with a
very particular regard to all sick Men.</P>
<P>The same Account <HI>John Westby, Robert Amsdem,</HI> and <HI>William Saunders upon Oath</HI> con∣firm'd;
except that Mr. <HI>Westby</HI> and <HI>Amsden</HI> said, they once heard or saw that one Mess
had but Sixteen pound of Bread one Week, which the Captain said he never heard
any Complaint of, for if he had, he should have as readily redrest it as he did the only Com∣plaint
was ever made him of Victuals, which was by <HI>William Griffeth,</HI> who brought him a
piece of Pork very small, which he order'd his Servant to take from him, and give <HI>Griffeth</HI> a
piece from his own Table in exchange for it; the truth of which was confirm'd by the Wit∣nesses,
and cannot he deny'd by the Prisoners themselves, unless they will run the hazard of
going from Man's Judgment to the most tremendous and eternal Judgment of God with guilt.</P>
<P>As for Chastisement, he did acknowledge that <HI>Ham Edgell</HI> and <HI>Wetherell</HI> had been
punished; <HI>Edgell</HI> because that he being a Quarter-Master, working in the <HI>Lazaretta,</HI> did break
open a Box, and stole about a dozen pound of white Suger; the next day the Captain de∣manded
at once all Keys of Chests, and did find the Sugar in his Chest: which Felony he
thought fit publickly to punish, especially in him, who being a Quarter-Master, might have the
opportunity of the same Fact in Goods of far greater value, and that it might prove exempla∣ry
to the whole Ships Company.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Ham</HI> purely for the welfare of those who complain against it, because that he after
many checks, and some blows, continued nasty to that degree, that upon a complaint of the
copperishness of the Pease, the Captain himself went into the Cook-room, and took off the
sides of the Copper a great quantity of Verdigreese, for which the Captain beat him with a
Japan Cane, but not to that degree as at all to wound or break his Skin, as the Chirurgeon's Mate,
Mr. <HI>Westby</HI> confirmed upon Oath. And <HI>Witherell</HI> was beaten for striking the Boatswain of the
Ship. And if Correction in such Cases be not used aboard Ships, no order can be maintain'd,
but all would run into Confusion.</P>
<P>And these very Men themselves, sometime after Seisure of the Ship, did seise the same <HI>Edward
Ham</HI> to the Gang-way, and severely beat him for the same Crime.</P>
