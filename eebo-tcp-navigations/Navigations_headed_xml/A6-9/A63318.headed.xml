<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE READERS.</HEAD>
<P>MAny there be among the Na∣tions in the World, that in their haste have unjustly con∣demned the innocent, guilt∣less, and harmless People of the Lord of Hosts (scornfully called <HI>Quakers</HI>) viz. That they are <HI>Papists, Jesuites,</HI> and what not, adhering to the Whorish false Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> I say to such on this wise, which is my advice, as a man to his friend, to whom this may come; Be not hasty to judge before the time, as many do to their own hurt, guilt and condem∣nation, before they have a clear and
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB REF="5"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB REF="6"/> right understanding of the things that differ from Equity and Truth, and so the Nobility of the Mind which should weigh and passe true Sentence of sound and perfect Judgement, the same being vailed with a hasty dark spirit of pre∣judice, or evil-surmising, which gets up into the seat of enmity, and therein pas∣seth sentence of the pure Way and things of God as Evil, Heresie, and what not? And thus it comes to passe, and indeed it cannot be otherwise with such that have not their minds stayed and fixed in that which is perfect and true, and clear and single, as is the clear manifestation of the Grace of Life, which is the Light of the Lord Jesus shining in the heart and conscience of the sons and daughters of men; and the same Light of the Lord which enlightneth the poor and deceitful man's eyes, is the true measure and equal ballance, which all are to try, and prove, and weigh words, thoughts, intents, wayes and actions, whether they be ju∣stifiable
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/> or condemnable; and hereby with the same measure of the true Spirit of God, who is Light, is true sentence to be passed accordingly: For if that which is perfectly true be measured with a false measure, or with an unequal ballance, it doth appear so to all that behold the same with an evil eye, or measure that with the same measure; save onely to them that discern the measure, weight, or bal∣lance: As for instance, as to the thing natural; If a deceitful man with a false measure, being guided by a deceivable spirit (albeit his eyes be enlight∣ned with the Light of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 29.</NOTE> which is true) if he measure a piece of Cloth to his Customer with his deceitful measure, though the Cloth be good, yet he not giving it its true measure, the simple-hearted is there∣by deceived, and knoweth it not till it be brought to a true measure, which doth answer the true Principle, or Light of God in the conscience to Justification, as
<PB REF="7"/> doth not the false, but contrariwise: Wherefore it is needful, and of absolute concernment, for the mind of every man male and female, to be guided and exer∣cised in the true manifestation of the Light of Jesus in the conscience; and so blessed is the man, the people, the family that bring their deeds to the Light, that they may be manifest they are wrought in God who is Light, who is Truth; and so what is here following, written and published, is to be tryed and proved by the Witness of God in every Conscience, which is true, and will answer to the same things or words that spring forth from its own clear nature.</P>
<P>Therefore, when thou hast honestly read this throughout with a meek spirit of sobriety and moderation, that's single and pure, then with the same spirit of singleness and of true discerning, judge honestly, and cease from hastiness in such matters of Eternity, lest a place of Re∣pentance become finally hid from thine
<PB REF="7"/> eyes, not to Salvation, but contrariwise; which I desire not, neither doth the Lord, whose Servant, a living and true Wit∣ness, I am, for Him, his Truth and Peo∣ple, of these things and much more.</P>
<P>Wherefore let the <HI>Reader</HI> see hereby, how that the Lord hath chosen the foolish things of this life to confound the wise, and that the living God Eternal hath chosen the weak things, to confound and bring to nought the things that are mighty, subtil, and potent; yea, base things, which are so deemed despisable and contemptible, yet behold God hath chosen them; and things that are not approvable in the sight of the prudent of this world, even to bring to nought things that are.</P>
<P>But may some say, <HI>Wherefore, or why doth the most High, Wise, In∣visible, Immortal God do thus?</HI></P>
<P>My Answer is one and the same as the Apostle saith, viz. <HI>That no flesh should glory in His presence,</HI> who of
<PB REF="8"/> God is made in us, <HI>Wisdom, Righte∣ousness, Sanctification,</HI> and <HI>Redem∣ption.</HI> And why should it be accoun∣ted such a foolish thing in the eyes of the wise men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this world, to see the wisdom of God dispensed through a weak Vessel? as is a free-born woman from above, a weaker Vessel than that of the man.</P>
<P>Now tell me, O man of understand∣ing, What must not the Spirit of Christ, or the same that is begotten of God in the female, as well as in the male, what must not (I say) the same Spirit of Life from God speak, but be limited in the weaker Vessel, in the foolish Vessel, in the Ves∣sel which is not esteemed, but base, con∣temptible and despised in the eyes of lofty man, that must be laid low, who excels in that wisdom and knowledge which is not from above, but otherwise, bruitish, and puffeth up the fleshly mind that's enmity to God, and is therefore to be confounded and moved backward, and
<PB REF="8" MS="y"/> slain upon the Cross, which is the Power of God that crucifieth the lusts and in∣ordinate affections of the flesh, which thereby come to be silent before the Lord, who is that one and self-same Spirit that is quick and powerful; so that not any other spirit governs or rules over the members of the body, but that which cre∣ated the body; and every Member which is to have the Supream Authority and Preheminence, as well in the female as in the male; and so He the Spirit of Truth, that's to guide into all Truth; He, the Man, is not he to speak? <HI>viz.</HI> Christ in the male, the same in the female, where He is risen and manifest as King, Priest and Prophet, a Guide, Leader, and Commander in all equitable and just things which are truly honourable?</P>
<P>But the Woman was in the trans∣gression against the Spirit; <HI>Flesh lust∣eth against the Spirit,</HI> saith the Apostle; and the Woman (that's in the trans∣gression) is to be under obedience, and to
<PB REF="9"/> be in silence, to learn in silence, and to ask her Husband at home: But what if she have a disorderly drunken husband (and not Christ the Man, the true Hus∣band, the true Lord) how can he teach her, seeing the Woman is to learn of her Husband in silence, and to be under o∣bedience (and not to usurp Authority over the Man) as also saith the Law, which hath dominion over all that are under it in the transgression? but the Spirit of Grace and Truth that's poured upon Sons and Daughters, teacheth us to deny the sin, and guideth from the same, and so maketh free from its Con∣demnation, and from under the Law, to be under the Grace and Truth that is in the one Seed, Christ, in the Male Christ, in the Female, the quickening Spirit, the Lord from Heaven: And those who are led and guided by this, are not under the Law, which saith, <HI>the wo∣man is not to usurp authority over the man,</HI> as also saith the able Minister
<PB REF="9"/> of the Mystery of the glory and riches of Eternity, which is Christ the fulness in his Saints, their hope of Life and Glory: But the Woman is to be under obedience, as also saith the Law; yea, but they that are led by the Spirit, are not under the Law, so are the Sons of God manifest; yet under the Grace covered; the same Grace with which the Man-Child, the holy Child <HI>Jesus</HI> was covered and filled with; the same, and no other but that which did and doth save the Saints from sin, and so from under the Law and its condemnation; and not only so, but al∣so the same Grace which bringeth Salva∣tion, and appeareth to all men; it tea∣cheth them not onely to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, but also to live sober∣ly and righteously in this present world. And verily this Grace is in them, which saves and justifieth them; and it's not of themselves, it is the gift of God.</P>
<P>And such are the Servants of the li∣ving and true God, that have their
<PB REF="10"/> fruits (and possess the same) unto Ho∣liness; and not only so, but the end of the same, which is the pure manifestation of the Eternal Substance, to wit, Ever∣lasting Life, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re clean Power, which is the excellent Treasure in the Earthen Vessels, as saith the holy Scripture, <HI>2 Cor. 4.</HI></P>
<P>But O ye Congregations of the dead! ye gathered Churches of so many Names and Heads, to you sounds my Voice, saying, What have ye done? Oh! how guilty do ye appear before mine eye that's single (in the Lord's Light) of despising Prophecying, and quenching the tender Spirit of Glory, which resteth at this day in and upon many Sons and Daugh∣ters; and behold, if ye can see how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, and have prophesied in the Name of the Lord, and have fore-warned you of that which is justly come to pass upon you, whilst many of you despised and wondred, in the dayes of haughtiness, and its prosperity among you. But, O
<PB REF="10"/> my soul, how hast thou been wounded in me, whilst I have travelled and mourned over you! And so you have been found despising that, and quenching that Spi∣rit of Grace which teacheth the Saints in Light, and reproves for sin, and testi∣fieth against the World and its deeds, because they are evil.</P>
<P>And this same Spirit strived long with you, and in you, and would have arisen up in its Authority, Power and great Glory from on high, had ye not preferred and exalted the spirit of this World in its proper place in you, above the Just and Long-suffering, which is but one and the same in male and fe∣male.</P>
<P>Oh! what have you done? Can any of you yet smite upon your thigh, and say so yet? if ye can, enquire, enquire ye, the Watchman's voice is the same it was, and not otherwise; <HI>viz.</HI> Return, come; yea, return and come to the ten∣der Spirit of holiness, and of the gentle∣ness
<PB REF="11"/> of Christ, and his yoke of Self-de∣nial, and the daily Cross, they are the two great Ordinances which ye have left behind; and so the Vail and the Dark∣ness hath covered you; but the <HI>true Is∣raelites</HI> have Light in their dwellings, and their habitations are in the best of the Land of the living.</P>
<P>Wherefore my spirit saith, Return, come and hearken to the Lamb's Voice, and now see whether ye can follow Him (or a stranger) wheresoever he goeth, that's the true Prophet, raised up like unto <HI>Moses,</HI> and obey his Voice, which savoureth not of this World; for so his Kingdom and Servants are not. There∣fore beware, lest your souls be cut off from the Land of the Living, and ye perish in the outward observations, (by which the Kingdom cometh not) among the Congregations of the dead, where ye are yet seeking the living; But I, as a Brother (even <HI>Joseph</HI>) tel you yet again, <HI>He is not there,</HI> but is arisen from the
<PB REF="11"/> dead, from death to life, who is the quick∣ning Spirit, the Lord from Heaven, over the Earth, over all the Land <HI>Aegypt,</HI> over the Land of Darkness; the same Lord, the same Spirit which hath done excellent things, is exalted in the new Heaven, and in the new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness; and let the Vir∣gin-Daughter of Sion publish the same, even from hence forth to all generations; yea, and my spirit is ready to say, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>There was one that saw a little Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands, and he well retained his sight so long un∣til (in the Light of the living) he saw the same which was so little, wax so great, that it became an exceeding great Mountain.</P>
<P>Verily, the beloved City is manifest, set upon a holy Hill; it cannot be bid from them that see; the Glory of God doth enlighten it, <HI>and the Lamb is the Light thereof,</HI> and his Light is like
<PB REF="12"/> unto a Stone most precious, clear as Chrystal.</P>
<P>The Fountain is opened free; come down from on high, and thou shalt see if thou dost thirst for Springs of Life. To the Light submit thy mind, and cease from strife, in the same to behold the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, from the false Church.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>SALUTATION</HI> and <HI>INFOR∣MATION</HI> to the whole Body of the Elect of God, whether gathered or scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth.</HEAD>
<P>O Ye Eternal and blessed Ones, whose dwelling is on high, in the fulness of all Beauty and Brightness, Glory, and everlasting Joy, Happiness and Peace for evermore; We who are poor Sufferers for the Seed of God, in the Covenant of Light, Life and Truth, do dearly salute and imbrace you all, according to our measures, Blessing, and Honour and Glo∣ry be given to our Lord God for ever, of all who know him, who hath counted us worthy, and hath chosen us among his faithful Ones, to bear his Name, and to witness forth his Truth, before the High
<PB N="2" REF="13"/> and Mighty men of the Earth, and to fight the Lord's Battel with his spiritual Wea∣pons, to the breaking down of strong holds, high lofty looks and vain imaginations, and spiritual wickedness in high places.</P>
<P>The Lord did give us a prosperous Journey hither, and when we came to <HI>Legorn,</HI> we were refreshed with Friends [who were there before us] and they did get a passage for us (and lodging) but as soon as we heard of the Vessel, we did feel our Service. So we went into the City in the living Power of the Lord, and there were many tender hearts did visit us, to their comfort, and our joy: The little time we staid there, we gave some of our Books and one Paper: so journying towards <HI>A∣lexandria,</HI> the Captain told us that <HI>Malta</HI> was in the way, and he must put in there a small time. But before we came there, our burthen was so heavy, that I was made to cry out (saying) <HI>Oh we have a dread∣full Cup to drink at that place! Oh how am I straitned till it be accomplished!</HI></P>
<P>And when we came there, the Walls of the City were full of people; some stood on the top of the Walls, as if something had troubled them. Before we came there,
<PB N="3" REF="13"/> we stood upon the Deck of the Ship, and I looked upon them, and said in my heart, <HI>Shall ye destroy us? If we give up to the Lord, then he is sufficient to deliver us out of their hands; but if we disobey our God, all those could not deliver us out of his hand.</HI> So all fear of man was taken from us.</P>
<P>The English Consul came aboard the Ship (as the Captain said) but we did not see him, and invited us to his House, it was the seventh, or last day of the week. The next morning, being moved of the Lord, we went a-shore, and the Consul met us, and we gave him a Paper, who sent us to his House with his Servant; and when we came there, at the present we were well entertained (like Princes) their <HI>Neighbours</HI> and <HI>Kinsfolk</HI> came in, and some <HI>Jesuites,</HI> and we gave them Books; they read a little, and laid them down, they were too hot: We declared our Mes∣sage to them in the Name of the Lord, and we gave some Books in the Street; so they were all set on work. Away went the Friars to the King (or Supream in the Island) and he would not meddle with us, but said, we were honest women, we might go about our business; and that
<PB N="4" REF="14"/> night we went a-board the Ship again: the Consul was troubled, for their snare was laid, and we felt it: Being moved of the Lord, we went in again the next day, and the Consul having a Sister in the Nun∣nery, desired us to go thither, that she might see us; and we went to them, and gave them a Boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; then to the Consuls we returned again, and sitting to wait to know the mind of the Lord, what he would have us to do, he said we must give in the great Paper; and if we would go to save our life, we should lose it.</P>

<HEAD>Here followeth a Copy of some more words which they had written before the for∣mer was given forth.</HEAD>
<P>A True Declaration concerning the Lord's love to us in all our Voy∣age. We were at Sea, between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Plymouth,</HI> many Weeks, and one day we had some tryals; and between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Legorn</HI> we were 31. days, and we had many tryals and storms within and with∣out; but the Lord did deliver us out of all. And when we came to <HI>Legorn,</HI> with the rest of our friends, we went into the Town after we had product, and stayed there ma∣ny dayes, where we had service every day; for all sorts of People came unto us, but no man did offer to hurt us, yet we gave them Books; and having got passage in a Dutch ship, we sailed towards <HI>Cyprus,</HI> in∣tending to go to <HI>Alexandria;</HI> but the Lord had appointed something for us to do by the way, as he did make it manifest to us, as I did speak; for the Master of the ship had no business in the place, but being in company with another ship, which had
<PB N="6" REF="15"/> some business at the City of <HI>Malta,</HI> (in the Island of <HI>Malta,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> suffered shipwrack) and being in the Harbour, on the first day of the week, we being moved of the Lord, went into the Town, and the <HI>English</HI> Consul met us on the shore, and asked us con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rning our coming, and we told him truth, and gave him some Books, and a Paper, and he told us there was an Inquisition, and he kindly entreated us to go to his house, and said, All that he had was at our service while we were there. And in the fear and dread of the Lord we went, and there came many to see us, and we called them to repentance, and many of them were tender, but the whole City is given to Idolatry. And we went a ship∣board that night, and the next day we be∣ing moved to go into the City again, dared not to flee the Cross, but in obedience went, desiring the will of God to be done. And when we came to the Governour, he told us that he had a sister in the Nunnery did desire to see us if we were free; and in the fear of God we went, and talked with them, and gave them a Book, and one of their Priests was with us (at the Nun∣nery) and had us into their place of Wor∣ship, and some would have us bow to the
<PB N="7" REF="15"/> high Altar, which we did deny; and ha∣ving a great burthen, we went to the Con∣sul again, and were waiting upon the Lord what to do, that we might know.</P>
<P>And the Inquisitors sent for us, and when we came before them, they asked our Names, and the Names of our Husbands, and the Names of our Fathers and Mo∣thers, and how many Children we had; and they asked us, <HI>Wherefore we came into that Country?</HI> And we told them, We were the Servants of the living God, and were moved to come and call them to Repen∣tance; and many other Questions, and they went away, but commanded that we should be stayed there. And the next day they came again, and called for us, and we came; but they would examine us apart, and called <HI>Sarah,</HI> and they asked, <HI>Whether she was a true Catholick?</HI> She said, That she was a true Christian that worshippeth God in Spirit and in Truth; and they proffer∣ed her the Crucifix, and would have had her swear that she would speak the Truth; and she said she should speak the Truth, but she would not swear, for Christ com∣manded her <HI>not to swear,</HI> saying, <HI>Swear not at all:</HI> And the <HI>English</HI> Consul perswaded her with much entreating, to swear, say∣ing,
<PB N="8" REF="16"/> <HI>None should do her any harm:</HI> But she denied; and they took some Books from her, and would have had her swear by them, but she would not: And they asked, <HI>Wherefore she brought the Books?</HI> And she said, Because we could not speak their Language, and they might know where∣fore we came; and they asked of her, what <HI>George Fox</HI> was; and she said, he was a Minister. And they asked <HI>wherefore she came thither?</HI> she said, To do the Will of God, as she was moved of the Lord. And they asked, <HI>How the Lord did appear unto her?</HI> And she said, by his Spirit. And they asked, <HI>Where she was when the Lord ap∣peared unto her?</HI> And she said, upon the Way. And they asked, <HI>Whether she did see his Presence, and hear his Voice?</HI> And she said, she did hear his Voice, and saw his Presence. And they asked, <HI>What he said to her?</HI> And she said, the Lord told her she must go over the Seas to do his Will. And they asked, <HI>How she knew it was the Lord?</HI> And she said, He bid her go, and his living Presence should go with her, and he was faithful that had promised, for she did feel his living Presence. So they went away.</P>
<P>Two dayes after they came again, and called for me, and offered me the Crucifix,
<PB N="9" REF="16"/> and told me, <HI>the Magistrate commanded me to swear that I would speak the Truth.</HI> And I told them that I should speak the Truth, for I was a Witness for God; but I should not swear, for a greater than the Magi∣strate saith, <HI>Swear not at all; but let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay; for whatso∣ever is more cometh of evil.</HI> But said they, <HI>You must obey the Justice, and he commands you to swear.</HI> I said, <HI>I should obey Justice,</HI> but if I should swear, I should do an <HI>unjust thing;</HI> for (the just) Christ said, <HI>Swear not at all.</HI> And they asked me, <HI>Whether I did own that Christ that died at Jerusalem?</HI> I answered, We owned the same Christ, and no other, he is the same yesterday, to day and for ever.</P>
<P>And they asked me, <HI>What I would do at Jerusalem?</HI> I said, <HI>I</HI> did not know that I should go there, but I should go to <HI>Alex∣andria;</HI> and they said, <HI>What to do?</HI> and I said, to do the Will of God; and if the Lord did open my mouth, I should call them to Repentance, and declare to them the day of the Lord, and direct their minds from darkness to Light.</P>
<P>Then they asked me, <HI>Whether I did tremble when I did preach?</HI> And I told them, I did tremble when the power of
<PB N="10" REF="17"/> God was upon me. And they asked, <HI>Whe∣ther I did see the Lord?</HI> I said, God was a Spirit, and he was spiritually discerned.</P>
<P>That day that we were had from the <HI>English</HI> Consuls to the Inquisition, the Con∣suls Wife brought us meat to eat, and as she past by me, I was smote with an Arrow to the heart, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eard a voice, saying, <HI>It is finished, she hath obtained her purpose.</HI> I did not taste of her meat, but went aside and wept bitterly. The Consul did affirm to us the night before, that there was no such thing, (as to ensnare us) intended; but it was in us as fire, and our souls were heavy even unto death; for many dayes before we saw in a Vision of our going there, (to prison) and we said, <HI>Pilate</HI> would do the <HI>Jews</HI> a pleasure, and wash his hands in innocency. He required a <HI>sign of me, if we were the Messengers of God;</HI> and the Lord gave me a sign for him, that stuck by him while he lived. The same day it was he called me, and told me, the Inquisition had sent for us, and they had Papers from <HI>Rome,</HI> and he did hope we should be set free, which was a lye; For he knew there was a room prepared for us. And there came a man with a black Rod, and the Chancellor and the Consul, and
<PB N="11" REF="17"/> had us before their Lord Inquisitor, and he asked us, <HI>Whether we had changed our minds yet?</HI> We said, Nay, we should not change from the Truth. He asked, <HI>What new Light we talkt of?</HI> We said, no new Light, but the same the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles</HI> bare te∣stimony to. Then he said. <HI>How came this Light to be lost ever since the Primitive times?</HI> We said, it was not lost, men had it still (in them) but they did not know it, by reason that the night of Apostacy had, and hath overspread the Nations. Then he said, <HI>If we would change our minds, and do as they would have us to do, we should say so, or else they would use us as they pleased.</HI> We said, the Will of the Lord be done. And he arose up and went his way with the Consul, and left us there. And the man with the black Rod, and the Keeper, took us and put us into an inner room in the Inquisition, which had but two little holes in it for light or air; but the glory of the Lord did shine round about us.</P>
<P>After the Consul came with tears in his eyes, and said, <HI>he was as sorry as for his own flesh, but there was some hopes in time;</HI> and so he went away, but never had peace while he lived. He would have given up the thirty pieces of silver again, but it
<PB N="12" REF="18"/> would not be received; the Witness was risen much in him, but slavish fear possest him. This was upon the sixt day of the Week, and our stomacks were taken away from all meat.</P>
<P>The next second day came a Magistrate, two Friars, &amp; the man with the black Rod, and a Scribe, and the Keeper to the Inqui∣sition, to sit upon Judgement, and examin∣ed us apart, conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rning our faith in Christ. The Magistrate would have had us to <HI>swear,</HI> and we answered, No; Christ said, <HI>Swear not at all;</HI> and so said <HI>James</HI> the Apostle. He asked, <HI>if we would speak Truth?</HI> We said, Yea. He asked, <HI>Whether we did be∣lieve the Creed?</HI> We said, we did believe in God, and in Jesus Christ, which was born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and suffered at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> under <HI>Pilate,</HI> and arose again from the dead the third day, and ascended to his Father, and shall come to judge∣ment, to judge both quick and dead. He asked, <HI>How we did believe the Resurrection?</HI> We answered, we did believe that the just and the unjust should arise, according to the Scriptures. He said, <HI>Do you believe in the Saints, and pray to them?</HI> We said, we did believe the Communion of Saints, but we did not pray to them, but to God onely,
<PB N="13" REF="18"/> in the Name of Jesus Christ. He asked, <HI>Whether we did believe in the Catholick Church?</HI> We said, we did believe the true Church of Christ; but the word <HI>Catholick</HI> we have not read in Scripture. He asked, <HI>If we believed a Purgatory?</HI> We said, No; but a Heaven and a Hell. The Friar said, <HI>We were commanded to pray for the dead; for those that were in Heaven had no need, and they that were in Hell, there is no redemption; therefore there must be a Purgatory.</HI> He ask∣ed, <HI>If we believed their holy Sacrament?</HI> We said, we never read the Word <HI>Sacra∣ment</HI> in Scripture. The Friar replyed, <HI>Where we did read in our Bibles,</HI> Sanctifica∣tion, <HI>it was</HI> Sacrament <HI>in theirs.</HI> He said, <HI>Their holy Sacrament was Bread and Wine, which they converted into the Flesh and Blood of Christ, by the virtue of Christ.</HI> We said, they did work Miracles then, for Christ's virtue is the same as it was when he turn∣ed Water into Wine, at the Marriage in <HI>Canaan.</HI> He said, <HI>If we did not eat the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh, and drink the Blood of the Son of God, we had no Life in us.</HI> We said, the Flesh and Blood of Christ is spiritual, and we do feed upon it daily; for that which is begotten of God in us, can no more live without spi∣ritual food, than our temporal bodies can
<PB N="14" REF="19"/> without temporal food. He said, <HI>That we did never hear Mass.</HI> We said, we did hear the voice of Christ, he only had the words of eternal Life, and that was sufficient for us. He said, <HI>We were Hereticks and Heathens.</HI> We said, they were <HI>Hereticks</HI> that lived in sin and wickedness, and such were <HI>Heathen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that knew not God. He asked about our <HI>Meetings in England;</HI> And we told them the truth to their amaze∣ment. And they asked, <HI>Who was the Head of our Church?</HI> We said, Christ. And they asked, <HI>What George Fox is?</HI> And we said, He is a Minister of Christ. They asked, <HI>Whether he sent us?</HI> We said, No; The Lord did move us to come. The Friar said, <HI>We were deceived, and had not the faith: but we have all virtues.</HI> We said, that faith was the ground from whence virtues do pro∣ceed. They said, <HI>If we would take their ho∣ly Sacrament, we might have our liberty; or else the Pope would not leave us for millions of Gold, but we should lose our souls and our bo∣dies too.</HI> We said, the Lord had provided for our souls, and our bodies were free∣ly given up to serve the Lord. They askt us, <HI>If we did not believe Marriage was a Sacrament?</HI> We said, it was an Ordinance of God. They askt us, <HI>If we did believe
<PB N="15" REF="19"/> men could forgive sins?</HI> We said, none could forgive sins but God onely. They brought us that Scripture, <HI>Whose sins ye re∣mit in earth, shall be remitted in heaven.</HI> We said, all Power was Gods, &amp; he could give it to whom he would (that were born of the eternal Spirit, and guided by the same; such have power to do the Fathers Will, as I an∣swered a Friar also in the City of <HI>Naples</HI>) and they were silent, the Power greatly working. We asked them wherein we had wronged them, that we should be kept Prisoners all days of our lives; and said, Our innocent blood would be required at their hands.</P>
<P>The Friar said, <HI>He would take our blood upon him, and our journey into Turky too.</HI> We told him, the time would come he would find he had enough upon him without it. They said, <HI>The Pope was Christ's Vicar, and we were of his Church, and what he did, was for the good of our Souls.</HI> We answered, The Lord had not committed the charge of our souls to the Pope, nor to them; for he had taken them into his own possession, glory was to his Name for ever. They said, <HI>We must be obedient.</HI> We said, we were obe∣dient to the government of Christs Spirit. The Friar said, <HI>None had the true Light
<PB N="16" REF="20"/> but the Catholicks; the Light that we had; was the spirit of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>We said, Wo to him that calleth <HI>Jesus</HI> accursed: Can the Devil give power over sin and iniquity? then he would destroy his own kingdom. He said, <HI>We were laught at, and mockt at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f every one.</HI> We said, What did become of the mockers? It was no matter. He said, <HI>We did run about to preach, and had not the true Faith.</HI> We said the true Faith is held in a pure Conscience void of offence towards God and man; and we had the true Faith. And he said, <HI>There was but one Faith, either theirs, or ours;</HI> and ask'd us <HI>which it was?</HI> We said, Every one had the true Faith, that did believe in God, and in Jesus whom he had sent; but they that say they do believe, and do not keep his Commandments, are lyars, and the truth is not in them. He said <HI>it was true:</HI> but he did thirst daily for our blood, because we would not turn, and urged us much about our Faith and Sacrament, to bring us under their Law; but the Lord preserved us.</P>
<P>They said, <HI>It was impossible we could live long in that hot room.</HI> So the next week-day they sate in Council; but, Oh how the swelling Sea did rage, and the proud waves
<PB N="17" REF="20"/> did foam, even unto the clouds of Heaven! and Proclamation was made at the Prison-Gate, we did not know the words, but the fire of the Lord flamed against it, <HI>[K.]</HI> my life was smitten, and I was in a very great agony, so that sweat was as drops of blood, and the Righteous One was laid into a Se∣pulcher, and a great stone was roll'd to the door; but the Prophecy was, that he should rise again the third day, which was fulfil∣led. But the next day they came to sit up∣on Judgement again, [but I say, in the true Judgment they sate not, but upon it they got up unjustly above the Righteous, and upon the same they sate; a Child of Wisdom may understand] and they brought many Propositions written in a Paper, but the Friar would suffer the Magistrate to propound but few to us, for fear the Light would break forth: But they ask'd, <HI>how many Friends of ours were gone forth in the Ministry, and into what parts?</HI> We told them what we did know. They said, <HI>All that came where the Pope had any thing to do, should never go back again.</HI> We said, the Lord was as sufficient for us, as he was for the Children in the fiery Furnace, and our trust was in God. They said, <HI>we were but few, and had been but a little while, but they
<PB N="18" REF="21"/> were many Countries, and had stood many hun∣dred years, and wrought many Miracles; and we had none.</HI> We said, we had thou∣sands at our Meetings, but none of us dare speak a word, but as they are eternally mo∣ved of the Lord: and we had Miracles; The Blind receive their sight, the Deaf do hear, and the Dumb d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speak, the Poor do receive the Gospel, the Lame do walk, and the Dead are raised. He asked, <HI>Why I look'd so, whether my Spirit was weak?</HI> I said, Nay, my body was weak, because I eat no meat, [it was in their <HI>Lent] He of∣fered me a Licence to eat flesh.</HI> I said I could not eat any thing at all, the ter∣rors of death were strongly upon me.</P>
<P>But three nights after the Lord said un∣to me, about the eleventh hour, <HI>Arise, and put on your clothes.</HI> I said, <HI>When wilt thou come, Lord?</HI> He said, <HI>VVhether at midnight, or at Cock-crow, do thou watch.</HI> My Friend and I arose, and the Lord said, <HI>Go, stand at the Door.</HI> And we stood at the door in the Power of the Lord, I did scarce know whether I was in the body, or out of the body. And about the twelfth hour there came many to the Prison-Gate: We heard the Keyes, and looked when they would come in. They
<PB N="19" REF="21"/> ran to and fro till the fourth hour: and the Lord said, he had smote them with blind∣ness, they could not find the way. And we went to bed, where I lay night and day for twelve dayes together, fasting and sweating, that my bed was wet, and great was our affliction.</P>
<P>The tenth day of my fast there came <HI>two Fryars,</HI> the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> the man with the <HI>black Rod,</HI> and a <HI>Physician,</HI> and the <HI>Keeper;</HI> and the <HI>Friar</HI> commanded my dear Friend to go out of the room, and he came and pull'd my hand out of the bed, and said, <HI>Is the Devil so great in you, that you cannot speak?</HI> I said, Depart from me thou worker of iniquity, I know thee not; the Power of the Lord is upon me, and thou callest him Devil. He took his Crucifix to strike me in the mouth; and I said, Look here! and I asked him, Whether it were that Cross which crucified <HI>Paul</HI> to the World, and the World unto him? And he said, <HI>it was.</HI> I denied him, and said, the Lord had made me a Witness for himself against all workers of iniquity. <HI>He bid me be obedient,</HI> and went to strike me. I said, Wilt thou strike me? He said, <HI>he would.</HI> I said, Thou art out of the Apo∣stles Doctrine, they were no strikers; I
<PB N="20" REF="22"/> deny thee to be any of them who went in the Name of the Lord. He said, <HI>he had brought me a Physician in charity.</HI> I said, the Lord was my Physician, and my sa∣ving-health. He said, <HI>I should be whipt, and quartered, and burnt that night in</HI> Malta, <HI>and my Mate too: wherefore did we come to teach them?</HI> I told him I did not fear, the Lord was on our side, and he had no power but what he had received and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did not use it to the same end the Lord gave it him, the Lord would judge him. And they were all smitten as dead men, and went away.</P>
<P>And as soon as they were gone, the Lord said unto me, <HI>The last Enemy that shall be destroyed, is Death;</HI> and the Life arose over Death, and I glorified God. The Friar went to my Friend, and told her, <HI>I called him worker of iniquity.</HI> Did she, said <HI>Sarah? Art thou without sin?</HI> He said <HI>he was;</HI> Then she hath wronged thee. [But I say, the wise Reader may judge:] For between the eighth and ninth hour in the evening, he sent a Drum to proclaim at the Prison-Gate; We know not what it was, but the Fire of the Lord consumed it. And about the fourth hour in the morning they were coming with a Drum and Guns;
<PB N="21" REF="22"/> and the Lord said unto me, <HI>Arise out of thy Grave-clothes:</HI> And we arose, and they came up to the Gate to devour us in a moment. But the Lord lifted up his Standard with his own Spirit of Might, and made them to retreat, and they fled as dust before the wind, praises and honour be given to our God for ever. I went to bed again, and the Lord said unto me, <HI>He∣rod will seek the young Child's life, to destroy it yet again;</HI> and great was my affliction, so that my dear Fellow-Labourer in the Work of God, did look every hour when I should depart the body for many dayes together; and we did look every hour when we should be brought to the stake day and night for several weeks, and <HI>Isaac</HI> was freely offered up: but the Lord said, he had provided a Ram in the bush.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Friar came again with his Physician; I told him, that I could not take any thing, unless I was moved of the Lord. He said, <HI>we must never come forth of that Room while we lived, and we might thank God and him it was no worse, for it was like to be worse.</HI> We said, if we had died, we had died as innocent as ever did Servants of the Lord. He said it was well we were innocent. They did (also) look
<PB N="22" REF="23"/> still when I would die. The Friar bid my Friend <HI>take notice what torment I would be in at the hour of death; thousands of Devils</HI> (he said) <HI>would fetch my soul to Hell.</HI> She said, she did not fear any such thing.</P>
<P>And he asked▪ <HI>if I did not think it expe∣dient for the Elders of the Church to pray over the sick?</HI> I said, Yea, such as were eternal∣ly moved of the Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Lord. He fell down on his knees and did howl, and wish bitter wishes upon himself if he had not the true Faith: but we denyed him. The Physician was in a great rage at <HI>Sa∣rah,</HI> because she could not bow to him, but to God only.</P>
<P>The last day of my Fast I began to be an hungry, but was afraid to eat, the Enemy was so strong; but the Lord said unto me, <HI>If thine Enemy hunger, féed him; if he thirst, give him drink: in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</HI> I did eat, and was re∣freshed, and glorified God; and in the midst of our extremity the Lord sent his holy Angels to comfort us, so that we re∣joyced and magnified God; and in the time of our great tryal, the Sun and Earth did mourn visibly three dayes, and the
<PB N="23" REF="23"/> horror of Death and pains of Hell was up∣on me; the Sun was darkned, the Moon was turned into blood, and the Stars did fall from Heaven, and there was great tribulation ten dayes, such as never was from the beginning of the world; and then I did see the Son of man coming in the Clouds with Power and great Glory, triumphing over his Enemies; the Hea∣vens were on fire, and the Elements did melt with fervent heat, and the Trumpet sounded out of <HI>Sion,</HI> and an Allarm was struck up in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and all the Ene∣mies of God were called to the great Day of Battel of the Lord. And I saw a great Wonder in Heaven, the Woman cloathed with the Sun, and had the Moon under her feet, and a Crown of twelve Stars upon her head, and she travelled in pain ready to be delivered of a Man-child; and there was a great Dragon stood ready to devour the Man-child as soon as it was born: and there was given to the Woman two wings of a great Eagle to carry her into the De∣sert, where she should be nourished for a time, times, and half a time; and the Dragon cast a Flood out of his mouth, &amp;c. And I saw War in Heaven, <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels against the <HI>Dragon</HI> and his An∣gels,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/> and the Lamb and his Army did over∣come them. And there was a Trumpet sounded in Heaven, and I heard a Voice saying to me, <HI>The City is divided into thrée parts.</HI> And I heard another Trum∣pet sounding, and I looked and saw an Angel go down into a great Pool of water, and I heard a Voice saying unto me, <HI>VVhosoever goeth down next after the troubling of the waters, shall be healed of whatsoever Disease he hath.</HI> And I heard another Trumpet sounding, and I heard a Voice saying, <HI>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, Babylon the great is fallen.</HI> And I looked and saw the smoak of her torment how it did ascend; and <HI>I</HI> heard another Trumpet sounding, and <HI>I</HI> heard a Voice saying, <HI>Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Hea∣ven: for he that is mighty hath magni∣fied you, and Holy is his Name: And from henceforth all generations shall call you blessed.</HI> And <HI>I</HI> heard another Trum∣pet sounding in Heaven, and I heard a Voice saying unto me, <HI>Behold!</HI> and <HI>I</HI> looked, and <HI>I</HI> saw <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Host pursuing the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and he and his Host were drowned in the Sea.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<P>Dear Friends and People, whatsoever I have written, it is not because it is re∣corded in the Scripture, or that I have heard of such things; but in obedience to the Lord I have written the things which <HI>I</HI> did hear, see, tasted and handled of the good Word of God, to the praise of his Name for ever.</P>
<P>And all this time my dear Sister in Christ Jesus, was in as great affliction as I (in a manner) to see my strong Travel night and day; yet she was kept in the patience, and would willingly have given me up to death, that I might have been at rest; yet she would have been left in as great dan∣ger, wo and misery, as ever was any poor captive for the Lord's truth; for they did work night and day with their Divinati∣ons, Inchantments and Temptations, thin∣king thereby to bring us under their pow∣er; but the Lord prevented them every way, so that great was their rage; and they came often with their Physician, and said it was in charity: I askt them whether they did keep us in that hot room to kill us, and bring us a Physitian to make us alive.</P>
<P>The Fryar said, <HI>The Inquisitor would lose his Head if he should take us thence; and it was better to keep us there, than to kill us.</HI></P>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<P>The Room was so hot and so close, that we were fain to rise often out of our bed, and lie down at a chink of their door for Air to fetch breath; and with the fire with∣in, and the heat without, our skin was like sheeps Leather, and the Hair did fall off our heads, and we did fail often. Our Affli∣ctions and Burthens were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat, that when it was day we wished for night; and when it was night we wished for day; we sought death, but could not find it; we de∣sired to die, but death fled from us: We did eat our bread weeping, and mingled our drink with our Tears. We did write to the Inquisitor, and laid before him our Innocency, and our Faithfulness, in giving our Testimony for the Lord amongst them: And I told him, if it were our Blood they did thurst after, they might take it any o∣ther way, as well as to smother us up in that hot room. So he sent the Fryar, and he took away our <HI>Ink-horns</HI> (they had our <HI>Bibles</HI> before). We asked why they took away our goods? They said, <HI>It was all theirs, and our Lives too, if they would.</HI> We asked, how we had forfeited our lives unto them; they said, <HI>For bringing Books and Papers.</HI> We said, if there were any thing in them that was not true, they might
<PB N="27" REF="25"/> write against it. They said, <HI>They did scorn to write to Fools and Asses that did not know true Latine.</HI> And they told us, <HI>the Inqui∣sitor would have us separated, because I was weak, and I should go into a cooler room;</HI> but <HI>Sarah</HI> should abide there; I took her by the arm, and said, <HI>The Lord hath joyned us together, and wo be to them that should part us.</HI> I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my Friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks; and the door was not opened in that time. Then they came again to part us, but I was sick, and broken out from head to foot. They sent for a Do∣ctor, and he said, <HI>We must have air, or else we must dye.</HI> So the Lord compelled them to go to the Inquisitor, and he gave order <HI>for the door to be set open six hours in a day:</HI> they did not part us till Ten weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp show∣ers the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place. They said, <HI>we corrupted each other, and that they thought when we were parted, we would have bowed to them.</HI> But they found we were more stronger after∣wards than we were before; the Lord our God did fit us for every condition. They
<PB N="28" REF="26"/> came and brought a Scourge of small Hemp, and asked us, <HI>If we would have any of it.</HI> They said, <HI>They did whip themselves till the blood did come.</HI> We said, that could not reach the Devil, he sate upon the heart. They said, <HI>All the men and women of</HI> Mal∣ta <HI>were for us, if we would be Catholicks, for there would be none like unto us.</HI> We said, the Lord had changed us into that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich chan∣ged not. They said, <HI>All their holy Women did pray for us, and we should be honoured of all the World if we would turn.</HI> We said, we were of God, and the whole world did lye in wickedness, and we denied the ho∣nor of the World, and the glory too. They said, <HI>We should be honoured of God too, but now we were hated of all.</HI> We said, it is an evident token whose Servants we are; <HI>the servant is not greater than the Lord;</HI> and that Scrpture was fulfilled which saith, <HI>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</HI></P>
<P>Upon a First day of the week, we were fasting and waiting upon the Lord till the second hour (after mid-day) and the Fry∣ars came and commanded us, <HI>In the Name of the Lord to kneel down with them to prayer.</HI> We said, we could not pray but as we were moved of the Lord. They commanded
<PB N="29" REF="26"/> us the second time. Then they kneeled down by our bed side, and prayed, and when they had done, they said, <HI>They had tryed our Spirits, now they knew what Spirit we were of.</HI> We told them, they could not know our Spirits, unless their minds were turned to the Light of the Lord Jesus in their Consciences. The English Fryar was wroth, and shewed us his <HI>Crucifix,</HI> and bid us <HI>look there.</HI> We said, the Lord saith, <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy self the Likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow to them, nor worship them, but I the Lord thy God only.</HI> He was so mad, he called for the Irons to chain <HI>Sarah,</HI> be∣cause she spake so boldly to him: She bow∣ed her head, and said to him, <HI>Not only my feet, but my hands and my neck also for the Testimony of Jesus.</HI> His wrath was soon appeased, and he said, <HI>He would do us any good he could; he did see what we did was not in malice:</HI> the power had broken him down for that present. They came to us often, saying, <HI>If you would do but a little, you should be set at liberty; but you will do nothing at all, but are against every thing.</HI> We said, we are against nothing that is of God, but would do any thing that might make for God's glory.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>
<P>Many did think we should not have been heard nor seen after we were in the <HI>Inqui∣sition;</HI> but the Lord did work wonderfully for us, and his Truth: For they new built the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and there were many <HI>La∣bourers</HI> for a year and a half, and the great Men came to see the building; and we were carried forth with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower to de∣clare in the Name of the Lord Jesus, not fearing the face of man; the Lord was our strength: But behold they threatned us with <HI>Irons</HI> and <HI>Halters,</HI> for preaching the Light so boldly; and they said, <HI>None ought to preach but Prelates to a Bishop</HI> (as they use to say in <HI>England.</HI>) Now their <HI>Lord Inquisitor</HI> (so called) and the <HI>Magi∣strates</HI> were kept moderate towards us, and gave order, <HI>we should have Ink and Paper to write to England.</HI> But we were hindered still; and we do believe they would have set us at liberty, had it not been for the Fryars; it was they that wrote against us still to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and to the <HI>Inquisitor;</HI> and we told them so. They sought three quar∣ters of a year to part us, before they could bring it to pass; and when they did part us, they prepared a Bed for <HI>Sarah,</HI> and their own <HI>Catholicks</HI> lay upon the Boards, that had not beds of their own. When we were
<PB N="31" REF="27"/> parted, the Lord would not suffer me to keep any money; I knew not the mind of God in it. Their Fryars came and said, <HI>We should never see one anothers faces again, but the Inquisitor should send me my food.</HI> But the Lord would not suffer him to send it. <HI>Sarah</HI> did send me such as she could get, near three weeks time. Then the Fry∣ar came and askt me, <HI>what I did want?</HI> I said, one to wash my Linnen, and some∣thing hot to eat; I was weak. He sent to <HI>Sarah</HI> to know <HI>if she would do it for me.</HI> She said she would. And by that means we did hear of each other every day. The Fryar said, <HI>You may free your self of misery when you will; you may make your self a Catholick, and have your freedom to go where you will.</HI> I told him, I might make my self a Catho∣lick, and have a name that I did live, when I was dead; and said, he had Catholicks enough already; he should bring some of them to the Light in their Consciences, that they might <HI>stand in awe, and sin not.</HI> He said, <HI>He would lose one of his fingers if we would be Catholicks.</HI> I said, it was <HI>Babylon</HI> that was built with <HI>Blood; <HI>Sion</HI></HI> was re∣deemed through <HI>Iudgment.</HI> They would have had me to set a Picture at my beds head, for a representation. I askt them if
<PB N="32" REF="28"/> they did think I did lack a Calf to wor∣ship? And whether they did not walk by the Rule of Scripture? The Fryar said, <HI>They did, but they had Traditions too. I</HI> said, if their traditions did derogate or dissent from the fundamentals of Christ's Do∣ctrine, the Prophets and Apostles, <HI>I</HI> deni∣ed them in the Name of the Lord. He said, <HI>They did not. I</HI> askt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where they had their Rule to burn them that could not joyn with them for Conscience? He said, <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>did worse, he gave them to the De∣vil, and that they did judge all damned that were not of their Faith.</HI> And he askt whe∣ther we did judge them so? <HI>I</HI> said, No, we had otherwise learned Christ. <HI>I</HI> askt him, why they did bind that which the Lord did not bind? and set tyes, chains and limits, where the Lord did not? as in <HI>meats</HI> and <HI>drinks,</HI> or in respect of <HI>dayes</HI> or <HI>times,</HI> which the Apostle called <HI>beggarly Elements,</HI> and <HI>Rudiments of the world,</HI> and <HI>forbidding to marry</HI> (a Doctrine of Devils said <HI>I.</HI>) He could no tell what to say, but told me, <HI>That St.</HI> Peter <HI>was the Pope of</HI> Rome, <HI>and did build an Altar there, and the Pope was his Successor, and he could do what he would. I</HI> denied that, and said, We never read any such thing in Scripture; for <HI>Peter,</HI> Christ's
<PB N="33" REF="28"/> Apostle, had no money to build Altars; he himself did offer Sacrifice upon the Altars made without hands. And he said, <HI>We were but a few, and risen up but late, and they were many, and had stood Fourteen hundred years; and God was a lyar if they had not the true Faith; for he had confirmed it to them by a thousand miracles. I</HI> said, the few number, and the little Flock is Christ's Flock. He askt if we were? <HI>then all the World,</HI> said he. <HI>I</HI> said, Our Faith was from the beginning. <HI>Abel</HI> was of our Church; and <HI>the World by Wisdom did not know God.</HI> He went to <HI>Sarah</HI> with the same Tempta∣tion, and she told him also, that <HI>Abel</HI> was of our Church. He said, <HI>Abel was a Catho∣lick, and</HI> Cain <HI>and</HI> Judas <HI>were so.</HI> She said, Then the Devil was a <HI>Catholick,</HI> and she would not be one. He threatned her, and told her, <HI>how many they were.</HI></P>
<P>She said, <HI>Daniel</HI> was but <HI>one;</HI> and if there were <HI>no more</HI> but <HI>she</HI> her self, she would not turn; but took her fingers and shewed them, if they would tear her joint∣meal, she did believe the Lord would en∣able her to endure it for the Truth.</P>
<P>So they went from one to another, think∣ing to entangle us in our talk; but we were guided by one Spirit, and spake one and
<PB N="34" REF="29" MS="y"/> the same thing in effect, so that they had not a jot nor tittle against us, but for righte∣ousness sake: Our God did keep us by his own Power &amp; Holiness out of their hands; honor and praises be given to his powerful Name for ever.</P>
<P>He (the said Fryar) came to me another time like a Bear robbed of her Whelps, and told me, <HI>If I would be a Catholick, I should say so; otherwise they wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> use me bad∣ly, and I should never see the face of</HI> Sarah <HI>again, but should dye by my self, and a thou∣sand Devils should carry my Soul to Hell. I</HI> asked him if he were the Messenger of God to me. He said he was. <HI>I</HI> said, What is my sin, or wherein have <HI>I</HI> provoked the Lord, that he doth send me such a strait Message? He said, <HI>Because I would not be a Catholick. I</HI> said, <HI>I</HI> deny thee and thy Mes∣sage too, and the Spirit which spake in thee; the Lord never spake it. He said, that <HI>he would lay me in a whole pile of Chains, where I should see neither Sun nor Moon. I</HI> said, He could not separate me from the Love of God in Christ Jesus, lay me where he would. He said, <HI>He would give me to the Devil. I</HI> said, <HI>I</HI> did not fear all the Devils in Hell, the Lord was my Keeper; though he had the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> with all the Coun∣tries
<PB N="35" REF="29" MS="y"/> round about, on his side, and was alone by my self, <HI>I</HI> did not fear them; if there were thousands more, the Lord was on my right hand, and the worst they could do, was but to kill the body; they could not touch my life no more than the Devil could <HI>Job's.</HI> He said, That <HI>I should never go out of that Room alive.</HI> I said, the Lord was sufficient to deliver me: But whether he would or would not, I would not forsake a living Fountain to drink at a broken Ci∣stern: And they had no Law to keep us there, but such a Law as <HI>Ahab</HI> had for <HI>Na∣both</HI>'s Vineyard. He curst himself, and cal∣led upon his gods, and went forth; and as he was making fast the door, he put in his hand at the hole of the door, and said, <HI>Abide there Member of the Devil.</HI> I said, The Devil's Members did the Devil's Works; the Woes and Plagues of the Lord would be upon them for it. He went and told the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> of it, and he laught at him: I saw it, and felt it in that which is Eternal. I was moved out of that Room before he came again; and when he came; he brought one of the Inquisitors men with him, and two very good Hens, and said, <HI>The Lord Inquisitor had sent them in love to me.</HI> I said, his love I did receive, but I
<PB N="36" REF="30"/> could not take his Hens, for it was not the practice of the Servants of the Lord to be chargeable to any while they have of their own. He said, <HI>We must not count any thing our own; for in the Primitive times they did sell their Possessions, and laid them down at the Apostles feet.</HI> He said, <HI>We should not want any thing if they did spend a thou∣sand Crowns.</HI> I believe he wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have had us laid down our money at his feet. He said, <HI>I was proud, because I would not take the Inquisitors Hens when he sent them me in charity.</HI> I asked whether he kept me in Prison, and sent me his Charity. He said, <HI>It was for the good of our Souls he kept us in prison.</HI> I told him, our Souls were out of the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> reach, or his either: He told me before, <HI>If we had not been going to preach, we might have gone where we would.</HI> I askt him, What should our souls have done then? and why their love should extend more to us, than to their own Family? They could not charge us with Sin, and they did commit all manner of Sin; they might put them into the Inquisition, and bid turn.</P>
<P>He said again, <HI>We had not the true Faith,</HI> and shewed me his Crucifix, and askt me, <HI>If I thought he did worship that?</HI> I askt him what he did do with it? He said, <HI>It was a
<PB N="37" REF="30"/> Representation.</HI> I said, it did not represent Christ, for he was the express Image of his Father's Glory, which is Light and Life. I said, if he could put any life in any of his images, he might bring them to me. And <HI>I</HI> askt him what <HI>Representation Daniel</HI> had in the <HI>Lyons Den;</HI> or <HI>Jonas</HI> in the <HI>Whales belly;</HI> they cryed unto the Lord, and he delivered them. He said, <HI>I talkt like a mad woman, I talkt so much against their Idols.</HI> He was in a rage, and said, <HI>He would give me to the Devil. I</HI> bid him give his own, <HI>I</HI> am the Lord's. He stood up, and said, <HI>He would do by me as the Apostles did by</HI> Ananias <HI>and</HI> Saphira. He stood up and opened his mouth; and <HI>I</HI> stood up to him, and denied him in the Name of the Lord, the living God, and said, he had no power over me. And away he went to <HI>Sarah</HI> with the Hens, and told her, <HI>that I was sick, and the Lord Inquisitor had sent two Hens, and I would be glad to eat a piece of one if she would dress one of them presently, and the o∣ther to morrow.</HI> [Mark this Deceiver, this Lyar!] But she standing in the Counsel of the Lord, answered him accordingly as <HI>I</HI> did; and he carried them away again. We did not dare to take them, the Lord did forbid us. He said, <HI>You would fain be
<PB N="38" REF="31"/> burned, because you would make the World be∣lieve you did love God so well as to suffer in that kind.</HI> I said, I did not desire to be burnt; but if the Lord did call me to it, I did believe he would give me power to under∣go it for his Truth; and if every hair of my head was a body, I could offer them up all for the Testimony of Jesus. He came twice <HI>to know whether I had not been inspired of the Holy Ghost to be a Catholick, since I came into the Inquisition.</HI> I said, No; he said, <HI>We were;</HI> he said, <HI>We called the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of the Devil.</HI> We said, the Spirit of the Holy Ghost in us will resist the Devil. We told him, the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost was never wrought in the Will of man, nor in man's time, but in the Will of God, and in God's time. He asked, <HI>How we did know a clean from an unclean Spirit?</HI> We said, An unclean spirit did burden the Seed of God, and dam up the Springs of Life; and a clean Spirit would open the Spring of Life, and refresh the Seed; it was a Riddle to him, but he said it was true: he would assent to pure Truth some∣times.</P>
<P>We asked him, Whether every man and woman did not stand guilty before God of
<PB N="39" REF="31"/> all the Sins they ever committed before Regeneration? He said, <HI>Yea.</HI> And he did confess all their Learning and Languages (in their places) was but to serve the Lord. We told him, all their Praying, Preaching and Crouding, was no more accepted than <HI>Cain's</HI> Sacrifice, unless they were moved of the eternal Spirit of the Lord. We askt him, If he that was in them, was greater than he that was in us; and why they had not overcome us all that time? We were very sensible of their workings day and night: He said, <HI>Because we resisted still.</HI> We askt him for our Bibles. He said, <HI>We should never see them again, they were false.</HI> We said, if they were conjuring Books, they had no warrant from the Lord to take them from us.</P>
<P>They alwayes came two Fryars at a time, and they would fall down and howl, and wish bitter wishes upon themselves if they were not in the Truth. We would deny them, and preach Truth to them, the Light of the Lord Jesus in the Consciences of every one, to lead them to a pure life; and did ask them where the pure and holy Life was, and what all of them did do, that the People did live in sin and all manner of wickedness? and whether Words and
<PB N="40" REF="32" MS="y"/> Forms would serve without Life and Pow∣er? He was as bloody a fiery Serpent, as e∣ver was born of a woman, and did strike as hard at our Lives, and would hold up his hand often to strike us, but had never the power, he would quickly be cut down, that he would say, <HI>we were good women, and he would do us any good.</HI> He was compelled to work for us sometimes, and would say it was for God's sake, and would have us thank him for it. We would tell him, those that did any thing for God, did not look for a reward from man. He said, <HI>We were the worst of all creatures, and we should be used worse than any; the Turks, Arminians, Pro∣testants and Lutherans should be used better than we.</HI> We said, the pure Life was ever counted the worst, and we must suffer; we were the Lord's, and could trust him; let him do what he would with us, we did not fear any evil tydings; we were setled and grounded in the Truth; and the more they did persecute us, the more stronger we did grow; We were bold and valiant for God's Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h, that whatsoever we did suf∣fer, we could not fear: We were separa∣ted One year; I had neither Fire nor Candle in that time above two hours, none did bring me any, nor I had not freedom to call for any.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="32" MS="y"/>
<P>The Fryars went to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and told her, <HI>if she would, she should go forth of the Pri∣son, and say nothing, nor do nothing.</HI> She said, she would upon that account. <HI>He</HI> said, they would come in the morning, and so they did; but the Lord saw their deceit, and fore-warned <HI>Sarah,</HI> and bid her mind <HI>Esau, who sold his Birth-right for a morsel of meat; and</HI> Judas, <HI>that betrayed his Master for thir∣ty pieces of Silver:</HI> That when they came, she (was strengthned against them, and) said, she stood in the Counsel of God, and could take up nothing in her own will; they had not power to have her forth. They said the Inquisitor said, <HI>If we did want Lin∣nen, Woollen, Stockens, Shooes or Money, we should have it.</HI></P>
<P>But there was a poor <HI>English</HI> Man, heard that <HI>Sarah</HI> was in a Room with a window next the Street, it was high; he got up, and spake a few words to her, and they came violently and hall'd him down, and cast him into Prison upon Life and Death: And the Friars came to know of us whe∣ther he had brought any Letters. We said, No; I did not see him. They said, they did think he would be hang'd for it. He was one that they had taken from the <HI>Turks,</HI> and made a Catholick of him. <HI>Sa∣rah</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="33"/> wrote a few lines to me of it, and said, She did think the <HI>English</HI> Friars were the chief actors of it (we had a private way to send to each other.) I wrote to her a∣gain, and after my Salutation, I said, Whereas she said the Friars were the chief actors, she might be sure of that, for they did hasten to fill up their measures; but I believe the Lord will preserve the poor man for his love; I am made to seek the Lord for him with tears: and I desired she would send him something once a day, if the Keeper would carry it; and I told her of the glorious Manifestations of God to my Soul, for her comfort, so that I was ra∣vished with Love, and my Beloved was the chiefest of ten thousands; and how I did not fear the face of any man, though I did feel their arrows, for my Physician is nigh me; and how I was waiting upon the Lord, and saw our safe return into <HI>England,</HI> and I was talking with <HI>G. F.</HI> to my great re∣freshment: The Name of <HI>G. F.</HI> did prick them to the heart. I said, it was much they did not tempt us with Money. I bid her take heed, the Light would discover it; and many more things, let it come under what cover it would.</P>
<P>And this Paper came to the Friars hands,
<PB N="43" REF="33"/> by what means we could never tell, but as the Light did shew us, the Lord would have it so; it smote the <HI>Friar,</HI> that he was tormented many dayes; and he translated it into <HI>Italian,</HI> and laid it before their Lord <HI>Inquisitor,</HI> and got the <HI>Inquisitor's</HI> Lieute∣nant, and came to me with both the Pa∣pers in his hand, and askt me, <HI>If I could read it? I</HI> said, yea, <HI>I</HI> writ it. <HI>O! did you indeed</HI> (said he.) And <HI>what is it you say of me here?</HI> That which is truth, said <HI>I.</HI> Then he said, <HI>Where is the Paper</HI> Sarah <HI>sent? bring it, or else I will search the Trunk, and every where else. I</HI> bid him search where he would. He said, <HI>I must tell what man it was that brought me the Ink, or else I should be tyed with Chains presently. I</HI> told him <HI>I</HI> had done no∣thing but what was just and right in the sight of God, and what <HI>I</HI> did suffer would be for Truth's sake; and <HI>I</HI> did not care, <HI>I</HI> would not meddle nor make with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he poor Workmen. He said, <HI>For God's sake tell me what</HI> Sarah <HI>did write? I</HI> told him, a few words, and said it was truth. Said he, <HI>You say it is much we do not tempt you with Money.</HI> And in a few hours they came and tempted us with Money often. So the Lieutenant took my Ink and threw it a∣way; and they were smitten as if they
<PB N="44" REF="34"/> would have fallen to the ground, and went their way: I saw them no more in three Weeks; but the poor man was set free the next morning.</P>
<P>They went to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and told her, <HI>that I had honestly confest all, and that she was best to confess too; and threatned her with a Halter, and to take away a Bed and Trunk, and her Money, to have half of it for me.</HI> She an∣swered, she might not fend to me any more. She askt him, Whether he was a Minister of Christ, or a Magistrate? if he were a Magistrate, he might take her mo∣ney, but she would not give it him: And they that were with him, said, <HI>No, he should not meddle with any thing.</HI> He was a bitter wicked man. He told her, <HI>She was possest.</HI> She answered and said, She was with the power of an endless Life.</P>
<P>The Lord was not wanting to us at any time, for Power nor Words to stop the mouths of gain-sayers of his Truth, nei∣ther in Revelations nor Visions; Praises be to his Name for ever: He kept us in our weakest condition, bold for his <HI>Truth,</HI> declaring against all sin and wickedness, so that many were convinced, but did not dare to own it, for fear of <HI>Faggot</HI> and <HI>Fire.</HI> There were none that had any thing to say
<PB N="45" REF="34"/> against what we spake, but the Friars, but would have us to joyn with them. There were none did come into the Inquisition, but the Judgments of the Lord would be upon them, so that they would cry and foam, and send for a Physitian many of them. The unclean spirits would cry out as much as ever they did against Jesus, and would gnash vvith their teeth vvhen we vvere at prayer: there vvas a Friar, and other great Men, the Friar vvould run as if he had been at his wits end, and call to the Keeper, and he vvould run for the En∣glish Frier, and he vvould go to the In∣quisitor for counsel, and sometimes they vvould send him word they should have a remedy, I should be sent to <HI>Rome;</HI> and sometimes the Friars would come, but had not power to say any thing to me of it. The Lord did say unto us, <HI>Lift up your Voice like the noise of a Trumpet, and sound forth my Truth like the shout of a King.</HI> There vvas one that Life was risen in him, but they vvere upon him as Eagles, till they had destroyed him; he did undergo terrible Judgments all the time he vvas in the Inquisition.</P>
<P>Our Money served us a year and seven weeks; and vvhen it vvas almost gone,
<PB N="46" REF="35"/> the Friars brought the <HI>Inquisitors Chamber∣lain</HI> to buy our Hats. We said, vve came not there to sel our clothes, nor any thing vve had. Then the Friar did commend us for that, and told us, <HI>we might have kept our money to serve us otherwise.</HI> We said, no, we could not keep any money, and be charge∣able to any; vve could trust God. He said, <HI>He did see we could;</HI> but <HI>they</HI> should have maintained us vvhile they kept us Pri∣soners.</P>
<P>And then the Lord did take away our Stomacks; vve did eat but little for three or four Weeks; and then the Lord called us to fasting for eleven dayes together, but it vvas so little, that the Friars came and said, <HI>That it was impossible that Creatures could live with so little meat,</HI> as they did see vve did for so long time together; and as∣ked, <HI>what we would do?</HI> And said, their <HI>Lord Inquisitor said, We might have any thing we would.</HI> We said, we must vvait to know the mind of God, vvhat he vvould have us to do. We did not fast in our own wills, but in obedience to the Lord. They were much troubled, and sent us meat, and said <HI>The English Connsul sent it.</HI> We could not take any thing till the Lord's time was come: We vvere vveak, so that <HI>Sarah</HI> did
<PB N="47" REF="35"/> dress her head as she would lye in her Grave (poor Lamb) I lay looking for the Lord to put an end to the sad Tryal, which way it seemed good in his sight: Then I heard a voice, saying, <HI>Ye shall not dye.</HI> I believed the Lord, and his glory did appear much in our fast; he was very gracious to us, and did refresh us with his living Pre∣sence continually, and we did behold his beauty to our great joy and comfort; and he was large to us in his Promises, so that we were keept quiet and still (the sting of Death being taken away) our souls, hearts, and minds were at peace with the Lord, so that they could not tell whether we were dead or alive, but as they did call to us once a day, till the time the Lord had appointed we should eat; and they were made to bring <HI>many good things,</HI> and laid them down by us; so that Scripture we witnessed fulfilled, <HI>Our Enemies treated us kindly in a strange Land, said I.</HI> But we were afraid to eat, and cryed to the Lord, and said, We had rather dye, than eat any thing that is polluted and unclean. The Lord said unto me, <HI>Thou mayest as freely eat, as if thou hadst wrought for it with thy hands; I will sanctifie it to thee <HI>through the Cross.</HI></HI> And he said to <HI>Sarah, Thou shalt eat the
<PB REF="36"/> Fruit of thy hands, and be blessed.</HI> We did eat, and were refreshed, to the praise and glory of our God for ever. We did eat but little in two Months; and they did bring us what ever we did speak for, for eight or ten dayes; and afterward we were so straitned for want of Food, it did us more hurt than our Fast: Yet the Lord did work as great a Miracle by our preservation, as he did by raising <HI>Lazarus</HI> out of the Grave. The Friars did say, <HI>The Lord did keep us alive by his mighty Power, because we should be Catholicks.</HI> We said, the Lord would make it manifest to us then; they should know the Lord had another end in it, one day.</P>
<P>But still they said, <HI>There was no Redemp∣tion for us.</HI> We said, with the Lord there was Mercy and plenteous Redemption. We bid them, <HI>Take heed ye be not found fighters against God.</HI> They said, <HI>We were foolish Women.</HI> We said, we were the Lords Fools, and the Lord's Fool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were right dear, and precious in his sight, and wo to them that do offend them. He said, <HI>They were the Lord's Fools,</HI> and shewed us their deceitful Gowns, and their shaven Crowns, and said, <HI>They did wear it for God's sake, to be laught at by the World.</HI> We said, they did
<PB N="49" REF="36"/> not wear it for God's sake, unless they were moved of the holy Spirit of God to wear it. He said, <HI>It was no matter, they did wear it because of their Superiours.</HI> [Mark, and before it was for God's sake, as he said] He thought to bring us under him for our food, and did make us suffer a while though the Inquisitor and the Magistrates had taken a course we should want for no∣thing. But the Lord did torment him and all the rest, till they did bring us such things as were fitting. Then he did work all that he could to send me to <HI>Rome,</HI> and was coming two or three times (for what I know) to fetch me forth, but the Lord would not suffer them; and when they saw they could not prevail that way, they said we should go both; but the Fri∣ar should go first, because he was not well; he got leave to go, he was so weary of com∣ming to us, that he did beseech the Lord Inquisitor he might come no more to us. He told <HI>Sarah, I was a Witch,</HI> and <HI>that I knew what was done at London,</HI> and he would come to me no more, he said, because when he did tell me a company of lyes, I said, <HI>I had a Witness for God in me, which was faithful and true, and I did believe God's Witness.</HI></P>
<PB N="50" REF="37"/>
<P>The Diviners did wax mad, and did run as at their wits end, from Mountain to Hill, and from Hill to Mountain, to cover them: They ran to the Inquisitor, &amp; writ to the Pope, and went to him; their King did not hide them at all; some of them did gnash with their teeth, and even gnaw their tongues for pain: Yet the rest would not repent of their blasphemy, sorcery nor enchantments, but did post on to fill up their measures. Oh! the Lord reward them according to their works.</P>
<P>A little before the Fryar went to <HI>Rome,</HI> he came to the Inquisition Chamber with a Scribe, to write concerning us, to carry it with him; I saw him, as God would have it; the Lord said, <HI>There is thy deadly foe.</HI> They were writing part of three days; and when they had ended it, the Lord would not let me eat till the Scribe did come where I was, that I might pronounce wo against it, and defie it, which I did do in the Name of the Lord, and it did wi∣ther with all the rest. After it was gone, the <HI>English</HI> Consul came to us with a Scribe, and he brought us a Doller from a Master of a ship, that came from <HI>Plymouth;</HI> I told him I did receive my Country-mans Love, but could not receive his Money.
<PB N="51" REF="37" MS="y"/> He askt me, <HI>What I would do if I would take no money?</HI> I said, the Lord was my portion, and I could not lack any good thing. I said to him, We were in thy house near 15. Weeks, didst thou see any cause of Death or Bonds in us? He said, <HI>No.</HI> I askt him, how he would dispence with his Conscience for telling us, <HI>He would have us before the Inquisitor,</HI> when he knew that Room was provided for us; and had not we been kept alive by the mighty Power of God, we might have been dead long since. He said, <HI>How could I help it?</HI> I said, we are the Servants of the living God, and were brought here by permission, and in the spirit of Meekness gave in our Testimony for the Lord in faithfulness, and told you the Truth as it is in Jesus, and called you all to Repentance, and fore∣warned you in love to your souls, of the evil the Lord is bringing upon you, if you do not repent. He said, <HI>How ever it be, it will go well with you.</HI> [Mark that] I told him, he required a sign of me when we were at his house, if we were the Servants of the Lord God; I gave him a sign from the living God, and my Friend gave him another from the Lord, to his shame and destruction for ever. I askt him, whe∣ther
<PB N="52" REF="38" MS="y"/> that was not true we spake to him? he said it was, <HI>but how should he help it?</HI> I said, Thou art a condemned person, and stand∣est guilty before God; yet nevertheless repent, if thou canst find a place. He smiled upon the Scribe in deceit, but his lips did quiver, and his belly trembled, and he could scarce stand upon his legs. He was as proper a man as most was in the City, and full, and in his prime age. Oh! he was consumed as a snail in a shel, which was a sufficient sign for the whole Ci∣ty, if their hearts were not harder than Adamants. He said, <HI>How should he help it?</HI> he might have helpt it, but he was as wil∣ling to prove us, as any of them all. He was sworn upon his Oath to protect the <HI>English;</HI> and their Ruler bid him let us go about our business, and said, <HI>we were honest Women;</HI> and then he might have let us go before we were under the black Rod.</P>
<P>Then he went to <HI>Sarah</HI> with the Dollar; she told him she could not take the Mo∣ney, but if he had a Letter for us, she should be free to receive that. He said, <HI>he had not any.</HI> He askt her, <HI>What she did want?</HI> She said, the Lord was her Shepherd, she could not want any good thing; but she did long for her freedom. He said, <HI>That,
<PB N="53" REF="38"/> you may have in time.</HI> He told us, <HI>We should have Ink and Paper to write,</HI> but when he was gone, they would not let us. The next time we heard of him, he was dead. We could have rejoyced if he had died for Righteousness sake; for the Lord delight∣eth not in the death of a sinner.</P>
<P>The Friar was gone to <HI>Rome,</HI> and they said, <HI>he must stay there till we came.</HI> There was great working to send us thither, but the Lord did prevent them, that they could not send us thither. Then the Lord did work to bring us together again after so long time we had been parted. There were five doors between us with Locks and Bolts, but the Keeper had not power to make them fast, but as <HI>Sarah</HI> could undo them to come where I could see her, but could not speak to her, for there were them that did watch us night and day; yet she being moved of the Lord, did come to my door by night; she must come by the Fri∣ars door, he and the Doctor of Law were together, and they did set a trap to take her in; many did watch about the Prison, and would complain. Then she was lockt up again; but they had no peace in that, till the doors were open again; then we did sit in the sight of each other, to wait upon
<PB N="54" REF="39"/> the Lord, so that our voices were heard far; the Magistrates would hear and bow to it sometime; then the complainers were weary, and did work to have us brought to∣gether, and we did wait and pray, and the Magistrates would come in and look upon us many times, but would say nothing to us.</P>
<P>There were of divers Nations brought into the Inquisition, Prisoners; and the Friars, and the rest that were great, would go in their way to make Christians of them, and we were made to stand up against them and their ways, and deny them in the Name of the Lord, and to declare the Truth to the simple-hearted continually, if we did suffer death for it. We could not endure to hear the Name of the Lord blas∣phemed, nor his pure way of Truth per∣verted, nor the ignorant deceived. They did write all they understood of what we spake, and sent it to the Court-Chamber before the Inquisitor and Magistrates, but the Lord did blast it with the mildews of his wrathful indignation, and burnt it up with the brightness of his Son, and we re∣joyced in our God; but still our burdens continued very heavy, and our righteous souls were vexed with the filthy conversa∣tion of the wicked, and the pure Seed of
<PB N="55" REF="39"/> God was prest from day to day, that our spirits did mourn, and our hearts were grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, and their rebellion against their Maker, who was so gracious to them, to suf∣fer them so long in all their abominations, and waited to be gracious to them, and knockt at the door of their hearts, calling for <HI>Justice, Mercy</HI> and <HI>Humility;</HI> but be∣hold <HI>Oppression, Cruelty,</HI> and <HI>Self-exaltati∣on,</HI> notwithstanding the Lord did strive so much with them, and sent so many unde∣niable Truths, and infallible Testimonies of the coming of his Son to Judgement, and so clear a manifestation of the way to eternal Salvation, given forth of his own mouth, by his eternal Spirit, and having us for an example, who were kept by his Power and Holiness; they had not a jot nor tittle against us, but for righteousness sake, though they had winnowed and fan∣ned us so long: glory, honour and praises be given to our God for ever.</P>
<P>O they would not let us know of any <HI>English</HI> Ship that came into the Harbour, as near as they could, but the Lord would make it manifest to us; we had a great working and striving in our Bodies, but we knew not what it meant; the arrows of
<PB N="56" REF="40"/> the Wicked did fly, so that my soul was plunged and overwhelmed from head to feet, and the terrors of the unrighteous had taken hold of us, and the flames of Hell compassed us about; then the Lord ap∣peared unto me in a dream, and said, <HI>There were two English Friends in the City, which did plead for our Liberty in our behalf, and he had taken all fear away from them, and made them bold.</HI></P>
<P>And in a little while after the Magi∣strates sent for us forth, and askt us, <HI>whe∣ther we were sick?</HI> or, <HI>whether we did want any thing?</HI> and were very tender to us, and said, <HI>we should write to England,</HI> and bid the Scribe give us <HI>Ink and Paper;</HI> he said he would, but he was so wicked he did not. They did not tell us of any <HI>English</HI> that were there; but there was one <HI>Francis Steward</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> a Captain of a Ship, and a <HI>Friar</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which came to the City together, (for what we know) and they did take great paines for us, and went to their Ruler, and the Inquisitor, and to se∣veral Magistrates and Friars, and the new <HI>English</HI> Consul with them, and wrought much amongst them, that all were willing to let us go, save the Inquisitor, they said; and he said, <HI>He could not free us without an
<PB N="57" REF="40"/> Order from the Pope.</HI> But we had many heavy enemies besides, which would not be seen; but they obtained the favour to come and speak with us, which was a great thing in such a place.</P>
<P>They sent for us to the Court-Chamber, and the <HI>English</HI> Consul askt us, <HI>If we were willing to go back to England?</HI> We said, if it were the will of God we might. The Captain spake to us with tears in his eyes, and told us what they had done for us, but could not prevail; It is this Inquisitor (said he) the rest were made free; you have preached among these people he said. We told him, we were called upon the Testimony of our Conscience, and the Truth that we have witnessed forth among them, we should stand to maintain with our blood. He said, <HI>If they could get us off, he would freely give us our passage, and pro∣vide for us,</HI> and the Vessel was his own. We told him, his love was as well accept∣ed of the Lord, as if he did carry us. He offered us money; he saw the Lord would not suffer us to take any. He took our Names. We told them they took us out of our way, and put us into the Inquisiti∣on, and bid us change our minds; and we could not, the Lord had changed us into
<PB N="58" REF="41"/> that which changed not, if they would burn us to ashes, or chop us as Herbs to the Pot. The Friar said, <HI>We did not work;</HI> which was false, we had Work of our own, and did work as we were able. We told him, our Work and Maintenance was in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And they said, <HI>It was true.</HI> He said, <HI>We would not accept of the Inquisitors Diet.</HI> We did not know who did prepare for us; we did receive our meat as we had freedom in the Lord. Then he said, <HI>We had suffer∣ed long enough, and too long, but we should have our freedom in few days, and that they would send to the Pope for an Order.</HI> And there were many English Ships that way; but the Captain saw it was a very hard thing, so that it grieved him to the heart: He prayed God to comfort us, and he went away, and we do beseech God to bless and preserve him, unto everlasting Life, and never to let him nor his, go without a bles∣sing from him, for his love: he did venture himself exceedingly in that place. But af∣ter he was gone, they arose up against us with one accord: The Inquisitor came up into a Tower, and lookt down upon us as if he would have eaten us, and they did try us for our lives again, and did shut up our doors many Weeks, we could not
<PB N="59" REF="41"/> tell for what; at length the Inquisitor came into the Tower again, and <HI>Sarah</HI> was moved to call to him, to have the door opened for us to go down into the Court to wash our clothes. Then he gave command for the door to be opened once a week; and in a little while 'twas open ever day. But great was our affliction indeed; and she told him if we were the Popes Prison∣ers, we would appeal to the Pope, and he should send us to him. But them in the Prison with us, especially the Friar, were mortal Enemies to us, but yet they would have fed us with the choicest of their meat, and would gladly give us whole Bottels of wine, if we would receive it, and were greatly troubled because we did re∣fuse to eat and drink with them, and did persecute us exceedingly; but the Lord did visit them with his dreadful Judge∣ments, the Friar was tormented night and day, his body did perish, the Doctors and Chyrurgeons did follow him a long time.</P>
<P>And there were two or three <HI>English</HI> Ships there, came into harbour, and <HI>Sarah</HI> saw the coming of them in a Vision of the night, and there was great pleading for us, that we saw; but she heard a Voice, saying, <HI>We could not go now.</HI> So we were mad:
<PB N="60" REF="42" MS="y"/> willing to wait the Lords time.</P>
<P>Then they sent for us forth when the Ships were gone, and askt us, <HI>If we would be Catholicks?</HI> And we said, we were true Christians, and had received the Spirit of Christ, and he that had not the Spirit of Christ was none of his. The <HI>English</HI> Con∣sul told us of the Ships, and said, <HI>They would not let us go unless we would be Catho∣licks; and that we must suffer more impri∣sonment yet,</HI> and said, <HI>he did what he could for us.</HI> One of the Magistrates shewed us the Cross; We told them, and said, We did take up the Cross of Christ daily, which is the great Power of God to crucifie sin and iniquity: so we told them that one of their <HI>Fathers</HI> did promise us our liberty. We did think that Friar was too tender-hearted to stay among them; he did take a great deal of pains for us (the Captain said) We told him, he would never have cause to repent it; the blessing of God would be upon him for any thing he should do for us; for we were the Servants of the living God; and he promised us our freedoms in a little time.</P>

<P>This following, I <HI>D. B.</HI> received from them in other Papers to Friends.</P>
<P><HI>O</HI> Dearly beloved Friends, Fathers, and Elders, and Pillars of Gods Spiritu∣all House, and Brethren and Sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the measure of Love and Life of our God, do we salute you all, and do embrace you in that which is Eternal, and we do greatly rejoyce, and glorify the Name of our Heavenly Father; that he hath counted us worthy to be partakers of the death and suffer∣ings of his blessed Son, with you; though we be the least of God's Flock, yet we are of the true Fold, whereof Christ Jesus is shepherd; and he hath had as tender a care over us, as he hath had of any of his Lambs which he hath called forth in this the day of his Power; and hath carried us through, and over as great afflictions as most of our Bre∣thren and sufferers for his Name, both in mockings, scoffings, scornings, reproaches, stripes, contradictions, perils at Land, and pe∣rils at Sea, fiery tryals, cruel threatnings,
<PB N="62" REF="43"/> grief of heart, sorrow of soul, heats and colds, fastings and watchings, fears within, and frightings without, terrible temptations and persecutions, and dreadful imprisonments and buffettings of Satan; yet in all these our tryals the Lord was very gracious unto us, and not absent himself from us, neither suffered his faithfulness to fail us, but did bear us up, and keep us from fainting in the midst of our ex∣tremity; we had not another to make our moan to, but the Lord alone, neither could we expect a drop of mercy, favour or refresh∣ment, but what he did distil from his living Presence, and work by his own strength; for we sat one in one room, and the other in the a∣nother, near a year; as Owls in deserts, and as People forsaken in solitary places; then did we enjoy the presence of the Lord, and did behold the brightness of his glory, and we did see you our dear Friends, in the Light of Jesus, and did behold your order; and stedfastness of your Faith and Love to all Saints, and were refresh∣ed in all the faithful hearted, and felt the is∣sues of Love and Life which did stream from the hearts of those that were wholly joyn∣ed to the Fountain, and were made sensible of the benefit of your Prayers.</P>
<P>O the sorrows, the mournings, the tears! but those that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.
<PB N="63" REF="43" MS="y"/> A true sorrow begets a true joy, and a true Cross, a true Crown: For when our sorrows did abound, the Love of God did abound much more; the deeper the sorrows, the greater the joyes; the greater the Cross, the weightier the Crown.</P>
<P>Dear Friends and Brethren, marvel not that Israel is not gathered, our Judgement re∣mains with the Lord, and so do our Labours; for it was not for want of travel, nor pain, nor love to their souls; for we could have been contented to have fed upon the Grass on the ground, so we might have had our freedom a∣mongst them: For, had it not been for the great opposition, they would have followed af∣ter us as Chickens after a Hen, both great and small. But oh the swelling Seas, the raging and foaming Waves, stormy Winds and Floods, and deep Waters, and high Mountains and Hills, hard Rocks, rough Ways, and crooked Paths, tall Cedars, strong Oaks, fruitless Trees, and corrupted ones, that cumber the ground, and hinder the righteous Seed to be sown, and the noble Plants from being planted! Oh! they shut up the Kingdom against the simple heart∣ed, and hide the key of Knowledge from the innocent Ones, and will not enter into the Kingdom themselves, nor suffer them that would enter, but stir up the Magistrates to
<PB N="64" REF="44"/> form carnal Weapons, thinking to prevent the Lord of taking to him his Inheritance, and to dispossess his Son, who is Heir of all, that he might not have a dwelling-place among them, nor a habitation nigh them; because that his Light will discover their darkness, and his brightness will burn up all their abominations, and mar their beauty, and stain their glory, their pomp and their pride, that it may perish as the untimely Figs, and fall as the Flower of the Field, and wither as the Grass upon the house-top. Oh! the Belly of Hell, the Jaws of Satan, the whole Mystery of Iniquity is at the height, and all manner of Abominations that make desolate, stands where it ought not, and is upholden by a Law; That upon pain of death none must speak against it, nor walk con∣trary to it. But praises to our God, he carried us forth to declare against it daily. Oh! the blind guides, the seducing spirits, that do cause the people to erre, and compel them to worship the Beast and his Image, and have his mark in their fore-heads, and in their hands, and to bow to Pictures and painted Walls, and to worship the things of their own hands, and to fall down to that which their own fingers have fashioned, and will not suffer them to look to∣wards <HI>Sion</HI> upon pain of death, nor to walk to∣wards <HI>Jerusalem</HI> upon pain of Faggot and
<PB N="65" REF="44"/> Fire, but must abide in Babel, and believe whatsoever they speak or do, to be truth. But oh the wayes, the worships, the fashions, forms, customs, traditions, observa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions and imagi∣nations which they have drawn in by their dark Divinations, to keep the poor people in blindness and ignorance, so that they perish for want of knowledge, and are corrupt∣ed, because the way of Truth is not made known among them; they are all in the many wayes, out of the one true and living way, and their wayes be so many and so monstrous, that they are unrehearsible; but the Lord our God hath kindled a fire in the midst of them, that will consume all forms, fashions, customs and traditions of men; and will burn up the briars, thorns and tares, stubble and fruitless Trees, and corrupted ones, and will blast all the fruits, works and labours of wicked and ungodly men, with the mildews of his wrath∣full indignation, and will scatter all his ene∣mies with the whirl-winds of his displeasure. They do not know the Scriptures. Their Bibles would grieve any honest heart to behold them, because of the corruption. They said, <HI>our Bi∣bles were false.</HI> I asked wherein? The Fri∣ar said, <HI>Maccabees was not in them.</HI> I said, if any were taken from them, yet the rest might be pure; but if any were added to them,
<PB N="66" REF="45"/> then they were corrupted. He askt me, Whe∣ther I did not think it meet for every one to bow at the Name of Jesus. I said, Yea. He said, <HI>Iesus,</HI> and bid me fall down, or bow my body. I told him, My heart and whole body was bowed under the Name of Jesus; but I should not stoop to his will, nor any man's else: He that departeth from Iniquity, boweth to the Name of Jesus; but those that live in Sin and Wickedness, do not stoop to the Son of God. And he told me, they stood in the same Power the Apostles did, and were guided by the same Spirit as they were. I asked why they did abuse their Power then, and make use of Car∣nal Weapons? He said they did not, they were all spiritual, their Inquisition, &amp; their Chains and Irons, and all is spiritual <HI>[the Wise may judge.]</HI> And he asked, Whether we judged them all damn'd that were not of our Judge∣ment. I said, Nay, we had otherwise learned Christ; those that were in a reprobate Condi∣tion to day, the Lord may call them out of it to morrow, for what I know. He said, They did judge us damn'd, and all that were not of their Faith. I told him, Man's Judgement we did not matter.</P>

<HEAD>A Vision.</HEAD>
<P>IN a Vision of the night, I saw in the Fir∣mament six Suns; one at a distance from the rest, that did appear to be but half an hour high; the other five stood four-square, one in the middle; and they did cross over each other; the highest did not seem to be above an hour high. And when I did awake, I was troubled in my spirit to know the Vision; and I waited upon the Lord, and he signified to me in the Light, The six Suns were six Nations, whose Lights were near out; and the five which crossed each other, signified to me some rising amongst them.</P>
<P>And the Friar came to me, and said, <HI>It was God's will we should be kept there, or else they could not keep us. I</HI> told him, the Lord did suffer wicked men to do wicked∣ly, but did not will them to do it. He did suffer <HI>Herod</HI> to take off <HI>John Baptist's</HI> head, but he did not will him to do it: and did suffer <HI>Stephen</HI> to be stoned, and <HI>Judas</HI> to betray Christ, but he did not will them to
<PB N="68" REF="46" MS="y"/> do it; for if he had, he would not have condemned them for it. He said, <HI>Then we are wicked men.</HI> I said, They are wicked men that work wickedness.</P>
<P>The Friar would say still, <HI>We had not the true Faith.</HI> We said, By Faith we stand, and by the Power of God we are upholden; dost thou think it is by our own power and holiness we are kept from a vain conver∣sation, from sin and wickedness? He said, <HI>That was our pride.</HI> We said, No, We could glory in the Lord, we were children of wrath once as well as others; but the Lord hath quickned us that were dead, by the living Word of his Grace, and hath washed, cleansed and sanctified us through soul and spirit, in part, according to our measures, and we do press forward towards that which is perfect. <HI>He</HI> then said, <HI>We were good Women, but yet there was no redem∣ption for us, except we would be Cathlicks.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Lord said, <HI>Fear not Daughters of</HI> Sion, <HI>I will carry you forth as Gold tryed in the fire.</HI> And many precious Pro∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es did the Lord refresh us with in our greatest extremity, and would appear in his Glory, that our souls would be ravished in his presence. I had the Spirit of Prayer up∣on me, but was afraid to speak to the Lord,
<PB N="69" REF="46"/> for fear I should speak one word that would not please him. And the Lord said, <HI>Fear not Daughter of</HI> Sion, <HI>ask what thou wilt, and I will grant it thée, whatsoever thy heart can with.</HI> I desired nothing of the Lord, but what would make for his Glory, whether it were my liberty or bon∣dage, life or death; wherein I was high∣ly accepted of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Room wherein I was separated, was near the <HI>Chancery,</HI> where all the Bi∣shops Courtiers did resort, and would come into the Inquisition Courts, and I had work amongst them daily; they would come on purpose to their condemnation: some would be smitten, and run as if they hunt∣ed; and some would be set on fire, and cry, <HI>Caldere, caldere,</HI> and <HI>fuoco, fuoco;</HI> and many would pitty us, because we were not Catholicks: the Friars would say, <HI>We might be Catholicks, and keep our own Religion too: and we should not be known we were Catho∣licks, except we were brought before a Justice of Peace.</HI> We askt if we should profess a Christ we should be asham'd of?</P>
<P>But as for the poor Workmen, they were willing to do any thing for us, and were diligent to hear us, the Witness of God in them did answer to the Truth: There were
<PB N="70" REF="47"/> many eyes over them; had it not been for the great opposition, there were hundreds would have flown to the Truth.</P>
<P>And because I said, I did talk with <HI>G.F.</HI> he (the Friar) asked, <HI>Whether</HI> G. F. <HI>did bring me money to maintain me in prison?</HI> I said, No; but though I was ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent in bo∣dy, yet I was present in spirit, and was refreshed in him, and in hundreds more besides. They said, <HI>I had seen Revelati∣ons, and had talk'd with</HI> G. F. <HI>and he was God's Revelation. Sarah</HI> said, Christ was God's Revelation. He said, <HI>she came un∣der the Haltar for saying Christ was God's Revelation.</HI> She answered, <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>As soon as it pleased God to reveal his Son in me, I did not consult with flesh and blood, but im∣mediately I went and preached him;</HI> and is not Christ God's Revelation then? He said, <HI>Who denied that?</HI></P>
<P>What they would have done to <HI>Sarah</HI> if they had taken her forth, we know not; but the Lord did work so wonderfully that night for the preservation of her poor soul out of their net, that he is worthy to be glorified for ever.</P>
<P>The next time he came to me, he came in Sheeps clothing, but he had a Wolf un∣der his Gown; he gave me words as soft
<PB N="71" REF="47"/> as Butter, and as smooth as Oyl, when he had a Sword in his heart, and a Spear in his hand; when they speak most fairest, then beware of them.</P>
<P>He desired us <HI>we would not think so hard∣ly of him, as if he were the Author of all our wrongs and troubles; he was not</HI> (he said) <HI>but would do any good he could for us, were it with his blood.</HI> But we thought he had been the chiefest that cast the poor man in Pri∣son, but he was the man that hope him out without any punishment at all, though the Inquisitor did say he should be severely punished. I told him he did well; he would have peace in it, and would never have cause to repent it. He did entreat us, <HI>he might not bear all the burthen.</HI> We told him of many wicked things he did act against us, and of his lying and cruel words. He bid us, <HI>take no notice what he did speak.</HI> But we did feel his spirit, that what he spake he would do, if he had not been chained. I did use to tell him, My conscience was not seared with a hot iron, I was not past feeling. At last he was so weary of coming to us, he did entreat the Inquisitor he might not come to us any more; the Judgment of the Lord did fol∣low him so, it was like to kill him.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="48"/>
<P>When we were partted, the Lord did work mightily for us, and we were kept by the Power of the Lord over our Enemies, and were bold for God's Truth, and did make war with them in Righteousness, so they could not gain-say us in the Truth: So that Scripture was fulfilled, <HI>The wicked mouthes must be stopped;</HI> and they were put to silence; praises be to our God, and were made to confess, or say <HI>Of a truth God was in us:</HI> our God was a consuming fire to them, they were not able to stand in his presence, but they would howl and make a noise like dogs, and cry, <HI>Jesu, Maria,</HI> and flie as people driven by a mighty rushing wind; the Power of the Lord did pursue after them like a sword; that Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, <HI>Christ came not to send peace on earth, but a sword,</HI> to cut down his Enemies; the Lord was on our side, and did take our part, and did fight for us, and did tread down our Enemies under our feet, that they could not hurt us. Mighty was the Work of God daily, our tongues cannot express it; they did work day and night with their Inchantments and Divi∣nations, Sorceries, unclean spirits crying and foaming, insomuch that we could take little rest day or night sometimes; but the
<PB N="73" REF="48"/> Lord was with us, and did work mightily by his Power, and kept us over them in the Life of the Son of God. My P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison was nigh to the Palace, and to their Worship, that I could be heard of both; and it was laid upon me of the Lord to call them to Repentance, and to turn to the Light, wherewith they were enlightned, vvhich vvould lead them out of all their wicked Wayes, Works and Worships, to serve the true and living God in Spirit and in Truth; the Power did raise the Witness in many, and troubled them; they did sigh and groan, and some did stay to hear me so long as they durst; for there were many did watch; and it was upon pain of death, or at least to be imprisoned: As was the poor <HI>English-man</HI> that did come and speak to me, whom they hall'd down violently, and put him in prison; but the Lord delivered him for his Love.</P>
<P>And we were parted One Year, but great was the Work of the Lord, and great was the Power to carry it on. He was not wanting to us, glory be to his Name, but did give us Words &amp; Wisdom according to our Work: So that Scripture was fulfilled which saith on this vvise, <HI>Ye need not pre∣meditate afore-hand what to speak, or what
<PB N="74" REF="49"/> to say; for it shall be given you of my hea∣venly Father what ye ought to speak,</HI> that the Enemies shall not gain-say: they were so tormented, that they did run to the Hills and to the Mountains, to cover them from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Wrath of the Lamb, which sits upon the Throne, to judge them righteously, and to condemn them for all their wicked deeds, which they so ungodlily had committed against him.</P>
<P>Oh! the goodness of the Lord, and his long-suffering and forbearance, vvhich would lead them to Repentance; but they would not hearken to his Counsel, but turned his Laws behind their backs, and hated to be instructed by them; therefore the Lord did laugh at their destruction, and did mock when their fear came: Their wickedness was so great, and my burthen so heavy to bear it, that I cryed to the Lord, and said, It is better for me to die, than to live: and would gladly have given up my life in testimony against them all; I was (as 'twere) compelled to declare against all their Wayes, Works and Wor∣ships, insomuch that they ran to the Inqui∣sitor to have me chained, or punish'd some other way; but the Power of the Lord
<PB N="75" REF="49"/> chained them, that they could not diminish a hair of my head; the Lord was my safe∣ty, praises be to his Name for ever.</P>
<P>Now some, as they passed to their Wor∣ship-houses, would sigh, and some pray, and some did throw stones at my Window; they did work night and day about the Pri∣son, as though they would have broke through to slay me; but the Lord was with me, and did fight for me, and did scatter his Enemies as the dust before the Wind: Glory be to his Name for evermore.</P>
<P>I cannot express the large Love of our God, how he did preserve us from so many Deaths and Threatnings, as they did come to me with, falling down upon their knees, saying Mass, and would have me to say af∣ter them; but in the Name of the Lord I denyed them. They would howl like Dogs, because they could not beguile the Innocent, and slay my righteous life; but praises be to the Lord our God, who did preserve me from the Wolf and the De∣vourers, denying them &amp; their Sacrifices.</P>
<P>And when they saw they could not pre∣vail to betray us from the Truth, then they said, <HI>they would give us to the Devil to be tormented, and deliver us over to their bad Catholicks, to do by us as they pleased;</HI> for
<PB N="76" REF="50"/> they would use us badly, and so they did seek to do: Oh the cursed noises and cryes the <HI>Sodomites</HI> did make, crying, <HI>Quake, quake,</HI> running about the Prison raging, and some singing, and crouding round the Prison night and day, as if they would have broke through to slay me; and the sons of <HI>Belial</HI> did run to bear false witness, so that I looked every hour when they would fetch me out, and slay me. The Enemy did so work to perswade, that they had prest my dear yoke fellow with stones, which was a great trouble to me, because I I could not suffer death with her; I did yeeld she had been slain. And afrerwards this great tribulation being ended, then they said, my (dear and faithful) yoke-fel∣low should be sent to <HI>Rome,</HI> and I should tarry at <HI>Malta;</HI> which did so encrease my sorrow and wrought upon my spirit, to try and examine wherefore the Lord should deal so hardly with me, as to leave me be∣hind; or whether he did not count me worthy to go and give in my Testimony with her, to <HI>Rome,</HI> and offer up my Life for the Testimony of <HI>Jesus,</HI> than to have my liberty to return to <HI>England</HI> with her? and I cryed day and night to the Lord, and would not give my soul rest, nor my eyes
<PB N="77" REF="50" MS="y"/> sleep, till the Lord did answer me, glory and praises be to his Name for ever. But we saw <HI>Jacob</HI> must part with all, <HI>Benjamin</HI> must go too. So we were willing to give up in obedience to the Lord; our tryals were unspeakable. Oh the unclean spirits! they would speak to us at noon-day; but the Lord did give us power over them, that we did not fear the wild Boars out of the Wood, nor the wild Beasts out of the Field.</P>
<P>Then there was one came and said, that <HI>Katherine and I must be both sent to Rome.</HI> Which did rejoyce my soul, and renewed my strength, because the Lord did count me worthy to go and give in my Testimo∣ny for his Truth, the Word of his Prophe∣sie, before the great and mighty ones of the Earth. The Lord said, <HI>I should not be a∣fraid;</HI> and he shewed me in the Light how he had bowed them down before us, and I saw them in the Light of Christ, how the <HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Friars</HI> and <HI>Sorcerers</HI> stood in ranks, bowing down before us. So we saw our Dominion in Spirit. They did work to send us to <HI>Rome,</HI> but the Lord did blast it, and fought against them, that they could not send us.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="51"/>
<P>Now our Testimony was as largely gi∣ven in at <HI>Rome,</HI> as at <HI>Malta.</HI> The Friars came to me, and shewed me <HI>Mary</HI> and her Babe pictured against a Wall, and would have me look upon it. I stampt with my foot, and said, Cursed be all Images and Image-makers, and all that fall down to worship them; Christ Jesus is the express Image of his Fathers Brightness, which is Light and Life; who doth reveal the My∣stery of Iniquity, the cunning working of Satan, to draw out the mind to follow him, from the pure Life, and to vail over the Just One from beholding the Presence of the Lord. But glory be to the Lord, who hath made him manifest in thousands of his, in this Day of his Power. When we were separated, we spake one and the same thing, being guided by one Spirit. They would go from me to <HI>Katherine,</HI> and they would bid her <HI>speak as Sarah did,</HI> and so she did, to their condemnation: Praises to the Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A PAPER sent from them, to the Pope's Lord Inquisitor in <HI>Malta. For the Lord Inquisitor and his Council, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MEns persons I cannot admire; they that do admire and respect any man's per∣son, do it because of advantage; and such are transgressors, the Apostles (<HI>James</HI> and <HI>Jude</HI>) say.</P>
<P>In obedience to the Lord, in love to your souls, from the Fountain of Love, and Springs of Life that stream forth to the refreshment of the whole City of God, am I constrained to visit you with these few Lines; and I beseech you to reade it with the Spirit of Moderation and Meekness, and see that nothing arise in you against it, for it is God's Truth.</P>
<P>Christ Jesus who is the Light of the world, that hath enl ghtned every one that comes into the world, saith, <HI>This is Life eternal, to know</HI> thee <HI>the only true God, &amp;</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>whom thou hast sent.</HI> Now the knowledge of God is Life eternal; and there is no other way to come to this knowledge, but to have the mind
<PB N="80" REF="52"/> turned from darkness to the Light; out of the visible, to that which is invisible, viz. <HI>the Light in the Conscience,</HI> which convinceth of sin and iniquity, when no mortal eye can see you: And as you come to love it, and to have your minds staid upon it, you will feel the Incomes of God's Power to administer con∣demnation upon the transgressor, that keeps the pure Seed in bondage in you; <HI>For Sion is redeemed through Judgement, and her Converts with Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>If thou believest in thy heart the Lord Jesus, and confessest with thy mouth that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved; for with the heart man believeth unto Salvation:</HI> And we do believe, and see, and taste, and handle of the good Word of Life, and have received the Spirit of Truth, to lead us into all Truth, and doth bring all things to our remembrance, without any visible thing. And <HI>Paul</HI> wrote to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> saying, <HI>My little Chil∣dren, of whom I travel in birth till Christ be formed in you.</HI> Where Christ is formed <HI>within,</HI> there needs no form without; the out∣ward form is called an Earthen Vessel, or an Earthen Tabernacle, or an Earthen House; but Christ Jesus is the express Image of his Fathers Glory (or Substance) which is Light and Life.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="52"/>
<P>Now the Image of Christ is a pure and a holy Image, a meek and a Dove-like Image, an innocent and a Lamb-like Image, a righ∣teous and a glorious Image, <HI>Christ in you the hope of Glory,</HI> saith the Apostle to the Saints.</P>
<P>The Lord our God hath given to every man a measure of the manifestation of his own Spi∣rit to profit withal, which is the Light in the Conscience, the true Teacher of his People; it is the Grace of God that bringeth Salvati∣on, that appeareth to all men, and it teacheth all that come to believe in it, and to love and to be guided by it, to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to walk soberly, righteously, holy and godly in this present world; and it will deal plainly with every one; none need to fear being deceived by that in them which doth condemn them for sin and evil: But they that live in Pride, are deceived already; they that live in Covetousness, are deceived already; and they that live in Lusts or Drunkenness, are deceived already; or in Lying, Swearing, Adultery or Idolatry, are deceived; or in Hypocrisie and Deceit, Hard-heartedness or Cruelty, they are deceived already; for those you know, are fruits which do proceed from a deceived heart, being corrupted for want of
<PB N="82" REF="53"/> knowledge: <HI>My People perish for want of knowledge,</HI> saith God. <HI>He that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his; and he that hath the Spirit of Christ, ought himself to walk as Christ walked:</HI> Now Christ was no Persecutor, he never imprisoned any, nor ever put any to suffer, but He and the holy Prophets and Apostles were made to suffer as evil doers, this we know.</P>
<P>The Day of the Lord is hot and terrible against all sin and iniquity, and that nature from whence it doth proceed, and We are a <HI>WO</HI> for all them that are laying up of a Fuel for it.</P>
<P>This is God's Truth, whether you can re∣ceive it yea or nay: I am ready to seal it with my blood, if the Lord shall call me to it.</P>
<P>Whosoever shall interpret this Paper before the Lord Inquisitor (so called) I charge thee in the Name of the living God, as thou wilt answer before his dreadful pre∣sence, to interpret it word by word, as it is written, without adding or diminish∣ing.</P>

<P>THe Friar then came to me, and askt me, <HI>why I did not work?</HI> I said unto him, What work dost thou do? He said, <HI>he did write.</HI> I told him I would write too, if he would bring me Pen, Ink and Paper; and I would write Truth. He said, <HI>He would not that we should write; for St.</HI> Paul <HI>did work at</HI> Rome, <HI>and we might get nine or ten grains a day, if we did knit, that is three half-pence.</HI> I told him, if we could have that priviledge amongst them, that <HI>Paul</HI> had at <HI>Rome</HI> under <HI>Caesar,</HI> which was a Heathenish King, we would have wrought, and not have been chargeable to any. <HI>Paul</HI> lived in his own hired house two years, with a Souldier to look to him, and had Friends of the same Occupation to work with him, and could send where he would, and whosoever would come to him, might, and he taught them in the Name of the Lord Jesus; and no man forbad him. So I askt him, Whether he knew the holy War of God, yea or nay? if he did, I told him he then did know we could not be without exercise day nor night. Then his mouth was stopped, and he spake no more to me of work. But though our affliction of body
<PB N="84" REF="54"/> was very great, and our travel of soul was greater, yet we did knit Stockens, and gave to them that were made serviceable to us, and did make Garments for the poor Pri∣soners, and mended their Clothes which had need, and were made helpful to them all, to their condemnation that did perse∣cute us. But we could not work at the Friar's will, nor any mans else, but as we had freedom in the Lord.</P>
<P>As I was weak in my bed, the Friar came to me, and said, <HI>We did deny the Scriptures.</HI> I told him, they did deny them; we did own them, and hold them forth, thou dost know it. He was in a rage, be∣cause I said they denied the Scriptures, and bid me <HI>eat my words again, and threatned death upon me.</HI> I said, Christ Jesus was the Light of the World, and had lighted every one that cometh into the World; which Light is our Salvation that do re∣ceive it, and the same Light is the Worlds Condemnation that do not believe in it. Then he said, <HI>He would lay me in Chains, where I should neither see Sun nor Moon.</HI> They say, <HI>The</HI> Father <HI>hath almost killed you,</HI> said he, <HI>but I will kill you quite before I have done.</HI> He had a Book in his hand, and he did study in it: I told him, he did
<PB N="85" REF="54"/> comprehend the words in his carnal mind; and he was wroth, and said, <HI>he would give me to the Devils to be tormented.</HI> I said, I deny the Devil and all his works and workers.</P>
<P>Some would come unto the Prison upon their Saints dayes, and ask us, <HI>what day it was?</HI> We did answer, We did not know, neither did we observe dayes nor times, months nor years. Then answer would be made, <HI>It was St.</HI> Joseph's <HI>day,</HI> or some other Saint; <HI>and St.</HI> Joseph <HI>should punish us that night, because we did not observe his day.</HI> We answered, We did know the Saints to be at peace with us, and we did not fear them. We further said, <HI>Paul</HI> did call it <HI>beggarly Elements</HI> and <HI>Rudiments of the World,</HI> to observe days, times, months and years; and their mouthes would be stopt for a time. Then came the Friar ano∣ther time, and told me, <HI>it was seventeen dayes to their Christmas;</HI> and said, <HI>the Vir∣gin Mary conceived with child that day,</HI> be∣ing the same day he spake to me on; as if she did go with child but seventeen dayes. And he said, <HI>the next day was Lady</HI> Ann's <HI>day, the Virgin</HI> Mary<HI>'s Mother, a Saint.</HI></P>
<P>Then, as I was crying to the Lord in Prayer because of our long-suffering, and
<PB N="86" REF="55"/> our strong travel and labour, and no fruit, as did appear; the Lord said unto me, <HI>Be not grieved, though</HI> Israel <HI>be not gather∣ed; the seed of</HI> Malta <HI>shall be as the stars of the sky for multitude: That which ye have sown, shall not dye, but live: Glo∣ry be to the Name of the Lord for ever.</HI></P>

<P>THese Writings following, are Copies of divers Letters which they had written to their Friends and near Relati∣ons in the time of my visitation of them: But it came so to pass, that as they were handing the same through the Grate of the Prison, by the hand of another man, to be communicated to my hand, being then pre∣sent in the Room also, that the said Let∣ters were intercepted, and in the first place communicated to the Pope's Lord Inquisi∣tor, and he forthwith sent for the Consul, and charged him to get the same truly co∣pied forth: Then the Consul was wrath with me that he should be exercised with so much trouble: But in the Light and Counsel of my God, I seeing and knowing that there was nothing in them but what came from a good ground of Innocency and Truth, and pure natural Affection, I was moved in bowels of tender Love, lest the said Letters should be finally miscarri∣ed, or shut up in obscurity, therefore I pro∣pounded to the Consul, If that were such a trouble to him, if he would let me have the Letters, I should copy them out truly.

<P>MY dearly beloved Sisters &amp; Friends of Truth, I dearly salute you in the Light, Life and Love of our God, which is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, wherein I do rejoyce, and have union with you. My Life is given up to serve the Lord. Oh how my soul travels for the Seed of God's Kingdom, to be sown throughout all Nations, for the ga∣thering in of Christ's scattered Flock, and for the destruction of sin and Satan: For our God is weighing the Mountains in
<PB N="117" REF="70"/> Scales, and the Dust in an equal Ballance: He is pulling down the mighty, and raising the meek, humble, lowly; he is feeding the poor and hungry with good things, but the rich he sends empty away. My dear Babes and Lambs, feed of the sincere Milk of the Word of Life, that you may grow up in it, and wax strong in spirit to praise the Lord, and to glorifie him who is wor∣thy. Be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; seek him earnestly, call upon him continually; let your whole Meditations be staid in him alway. Seek him earnestly; deny your own thoughts and words; give heed to the Light, bring all your deeds to it; give up all that is contrary, to be slain; stand single, empty, naked before the Lord, that you may be filled with the Streams of his everlasting Love. Oh my dear hearts! our God is full of love; stand not back, press forward, let nothing hinder you; the Lord calls for you, <HI>My Son, give me thy heart:</HI> The Pro∣mise of our God is as large to you as to any, if you can believe; your straitness is in your selves; For God is a full Foun∣tain; abundance of love runs forth to them that can trust him; I can witness it; in the barren Wilderness he caused streams
<PB N="118" REF="71"/> of living Water to break forth: I cannot express it, it is so large; therefore doth my soul thirst after you, my dear Ones; the love of God is to you. My dear Sisters, I have you in my remembrance, and do pray to my God and your God, that you may be enlarged in your measures to praise the Lord, and to be kept in a sensible feeling of his Power daily; and that you may en∣crease in wisdom, strength and power over God's Enemies. The Blessing of the Lord God Almighty be with you, and preserve you by his mighty Power, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Salute me to my Sister <HI>S. R.</HI> there is a tender Plant in her; I do feel it to my comfort, praises be to the Lord.

<P>DEar Husband, with my dear Children, I beseech you together, to wait in the patience, having your minds alwayes staid upon the Lord: Keep out of incum∣brances, for that is the Enemies opportu∣nity to step in, when the mind is gone forth, to vail the pure, and darken the understanding, and so hinder you of the pure enjoyment of beholding the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Take no more upon you than you are able to perform in the Spirit of moderation and meekness, for that is in the sight of God of great price: See the Lord going before you in all your occasions, that you may be prosperous in all your underta∣kings; wait diligently upon the Lord, to be seasoned with his Grace, that you may

<P>After our money was gone, the Lord In∣quisitor, with the rest in Authority, put a great allowance in one of their servants hands for our maintenance, because we could take no money our selves; the Lord of Heaven did forbid us to meddle with a∣ny; and he did send to know whether we did want any clothes, he would send it to the Prison to us: This was the large love of our God to us, and we were made con∣tented with that we had, till the Lord God (who is rich in mercy, and full of all Grace, and is never unmindful of any which trust in his Name) of his everlasting love did send his faithful Messenger, whose feet are beautiful, and face is comely, cloathed with a bright shining Garment from the Crown of the head, to the soal of

<HEAD>A Copy of a Letter that I was moved to write the next day after I came to the Island and City, and communicated to their hands.</HEAD>
<P>DEar Lambs, Peace be unto you, <HI>Amen.</HI> Now seeing that the Everlasting God and Father of all Truth, hath in his tender love, fatherly mercy, and bowels of compassion (through the tryals of ma∣nifold sufferings and temptations) hither∣to, even to this day, upheld and preserved you in the Innocency, and its Testimony against the contrary; although sometimes (I know that) you have tasted the sentence of death in your selves, and even (as it were) ready to despair of life; yet in the living Testimony of Innocency, in the an∣swer of a good Conscience, I <HI>Daniel,</HI> bear you Record in the Covenant of Life, the same remaineth with you, and you are in it a good sweet savour to the Lord, and his Eternal Truth and People. Oh! blessed for ever be his Name, yea, and my very heart and life blesseth and magnifieth the Lord on your behalf.</P>
<PB N="128" REF="76"/>
<P>Wherefore my dear Friends, be faithful, full of Faith, and the living invisible God of Peace is with you, and will not forsake you, seeing it is so; and much more you know which might be declared.</P>
<P>Oh! I am moved in the Bowels of my Father's Love, as one with you (in tryals, and the exercise of manifold temptations) to stir up your pure and innocent minds by way of remembrance, and also to beseech you to take heed to the Testimony of Life that's undefiled, and manifest in you, and to dwell in the same which retains the Joy and Comfort of the Lord, and his Peace, which you know is not of the World; and so to watch and beware of the Enemy that is near to tempt to make shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience, and to dis∣pair, and so to betray not only your own innocent long-sufferings, but also the Te∣stimony of the Lord God of our Life, for which you have so long suffered, and by the pure Divine Vertue of the same have you been to this day preserved; so that the Lord (who is and will be your reward) hath not been wanting to you on his part. Oh faint not, but lift up your heads, and be faithful still, as I am not otherwise per∣swaded concerning you; and I am well
<PB N="129" REF="76"/> perswaded that in his own Covenant and Way, Deliverance will come to the Seed; and ye know, if the same come not in his own Covenant of Truth, in the Light of his Countenance, it cannot be well; but <HI>your nay</HI> (you know) <HI>is to be nay,</HI> and so to stand in the Truth, against the contrary, whatsoever our God permits unreasonable men to inflict upon the outward or visible body; and the same also will work for his Glory, and also for the Good and Eternal Peace of his innocent suffering Lambs not∣withstanding.</P>

<P>ANd when this, with other Papers, I had (through not a little difficulty) communicated to their hands over the heads of our Enemies, I was moved to speak my Message, as from the Lord of Life, to them, after I had offered up my body, and to lay down my Life for these poor Innocents, my dear Friends; and so with my voice I saluted them in the Lord's Truth, as they stood at the Prison-Grates, with these words, in the behalf of the ge∣neral Assembly of the Saints in light, to
<PB N="130" REF="77"/> wit, <HI>The whole Body of God's Elect, right dearly, owneth your Testimony, and you are a sweet savour unto the Lord and his people:</HI> And forasmuch as one of these poor affli∣cted Lambs replied, and said on this wise, as if it was a trouble to them that they could not be more serviceable. Then my heart being melted, and my bowels of pi∣ty, mercy and compassion, being moved, I said, That it was a wonderful mercy of the Lord, in as much as they were preser∣ved in their own measure of Truth, and pure Innocency, for which my heart prai∣sed the Lord for what mine eye saw, which right dearly affected my heart; and we were well refreshed at that season, in the sweet presence of our living God, albeit, our bodies were at a distance, but so as we could behold each others face through the Prison bars of Iron, in the Inquisition.</P>
<P>Now for so much as in the Wisdom of God it is seen meet, that the fore-mentio∣ned and following Writings which came from their hands, might appear to publick view, that thereby every Member of the one Body may have a right understanding; and not only so, but also a sensible feeling,
<PB N="131" REF="77"/> not only of the tryals &amp; sufferings in part of these innocent Lambs, but also, of the Consolations of each other, as fellow-Members of the infinite Body of which Christ Jesus the Lord is both King and Head; in whom be endless dominion and pure glory, and eternal salvation, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And so I being as it were constrained to publish the acceptable Words, that sound and savor of pure innocency and clear truth, for the Elect's sake; in the same Love and Life I am the more free hereun∣to, even as a Child, that differs but little from a servant, as I am in the Fathers Love, Power and Grace of Life, fitted to serve the undefiled Life of the least in the Kingdom of Blessedness, and to admini∣ster comfort, or what else I have received from the Eternal Fountain or Fulness, for the use or service of either body, mind, soul or spirit, of my own flesh or family, seeing no man ever hated his own Flesh; and he is worse than an Infidel that pro∣videth not for his own Family, especially them of his own House.</P>

<HEAD>This is a sweet Salutation to Gods Elect Church in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>RIght dear, precious and Heavenly Ones, whose Beauty shineth bright, and at whose Name the hearts of the Hea∣then do tremble: We, who through the everlasting Mercies of our God, are Mem∣bers of the same Body, and are held in strait Captivity, and hard Bondage, for witnessing forth the same Testimony and Covenant of pure Light, Life and Truth of our God, with you dear and faithful Ones indeed; <HI>We</HI> here in the same Cove∣nant of pure Love, and bowels of tender∣ness, do dearly salute and imbrace you all, glorifying and praising our eternal Father for you all, who hath counted us worthy to partake of the fellowship and sufferings for the Bodies sake, with you in tribulati∣ons, fiery tryals, manifold temptations, fastings, watchings, heats and colds, and cruel threatning and persecutions, perils by Sea, and perils by Land, standing in jeopardy of our lives year after year, and looking every hour, day and night, for ma∣ny
<PB N="133" REF="78" MS="y"/> Weeks together, when we should be brought out to Execution; but though Pro∣clamation was made, and they came up to the very Gate with a Drum and Mus∣quets, to fetch us out to destroy us, yet the Lord God of everlasting strength, who in the deepest of all dangers, and greatest extremity, when all hopes were past, did but blow upon them with the breath of his nostrils, and they did fly as dust before the Wind; for which we do intreat all Friends to glorifie our God on our behalf; for never did the Lord our God work grea∣ter Deliverance for any, than he hath done for us from time to time, who are the least and weakest, for what we know, that ever the Lord our God sent forth in so great and weighty a work: but all things are possible with him, who made and created all things; It is he alone which carrieth on his own Work by his own mighty Pow∣er, and the glory shall be his own for ever∣more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Oh our dearly beloved Friends, did you know but the third part of the Afflictions the Lord our God hath carried us through, you would say, The Lord hath wrought as great a Miracle in our preservation, as ever he did in raising <HI>Lazarus</HI> out of the
<PB N="134" REF="79"/> Grave: And in the greatest of our afflicti∣ons, we could not say in our hearts, Fa∣ther, would thou hadst not brought us hither, but cryed mightily to our God for Power to carry us through whatsoever should be inflicted upon us, that the Truth of our God might not suffer through our weakness: And the Lord did hear us, and answered us in righteousness, and carried us on with all boldness, and made our fore-heads as Flint, &amp; our brows as Brass, in the faces of our Enemies, that whensoe∣ver we were brought forth upon tryal, all fear was taken away, that we stood as Iron-Gates, and Castle-Walls in the faces of our Enemies, so that they said, <HI>we would fain be burned;</HI> but we answered, No, we would not willingly be burned; but if our heavenly Father doth call us to suffer in that kind for his Name sake, he will give us power to go through it: and we have great cause to believe it; for our Lord God never called us to do any service for him, but he gave us power, and made way for his own Work; glory and praise be to his holy Name for ever.</P>
<P>Dearly beloved Friends, marvel not why <HI>Israel</HI> is not gathered in all this time; it is not for want of labour, nor travel, nor
<PB N="135" REF="79"/> grief, nor pain, fasting nor mourning, nor weeping, nor love to their souls; but it is because of the great Oppression: For here are a willing people, but they dare not until the Lord make way for them. Truly Friends, we have not been idle since we saw your faces, nor have we had much ease to the flesh, but do travel night and day for <HI>Sion's</HI> prosperity and perfect joy, and for the reparation of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and her pure praise; though our sorrows are deep, and our afflictions grievous, yet we do wait with patience to reap the peace∣able fruits of righteousness, and enjoy the benefit of our uprightness; Praises be to our God for ever, he hath kept us by his power and holiness, that our Ene∣mies have not one jot or tittle against us, but for the Truth of our God, and that we could not joyn with them; so they would not suffer us to have one line of refresh∣ment, but stript us out of all, so that we could not expect one drop of mercy, favour nor affection, but what our heavenly Fa∣ther did distil upon us from his living pre∣sence, and work for us by the operation of his own Arm of strength and power.</P>
<P>But dear Friends, though a long Winter, and many sharp and terrible Storms have
<PB N="136" REF="80"/> past over our heads, so that we cannot ex∣press our Sorrows; so likewise we cannot declare our Joys. Oh! in the midst of all our afflictions, our God did draw nigh un∣to us, and did speak comfortably unto us with many sweet and precious Promises, and did never suffer his faithfulness to fail us, nor was he wanting unto us in Visions and Revelations. Oh! how doth he ap∣pear in his Glory, Beauty and Brightness, so that our souls are ravished and wrapped up with his living presence and glory ma∣ny times, so that we do not dare to look out at our long-sufferings nor tryals, but do press forwards towards the fulness of Joy and Blessedness, which our eternal Father hath prepared for all them that love him, and walk in obedience to him; and we know, the deeper our sorrow is, the greater our Joy shall be; and the heavier our Cross, the weightier our Crown, as we abide faithful: And we do believe, that neither principalities, nor powers, nor suf∣ferings, nor imprisonment, nor persecuti∣on, nor life nor death, shall be able to se∣parate us from the Love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour, <HI>Amen:</HI></P>
<P>Dearly beloved Friends, though our bodies are bolted up in the Rocks &amp; Caves
<PB N="137" REF="80" MS="y"/> of the Earth, yet our spirits (you know) none can limit nor confine to any place. And we do behold your order and stedfast∣ness of your Faith, and Labour of love, and are daily refreshed in all the faithful-hear∣ted. Oh dear hearts! the remembrance of the least of you is precious. Oh! the Rivers of tears that have distilled from our eyes, whilst we do think upon you, for joy, because of your growth and flourishing in the Truth. Oh! you are Virgins indeed, who have Oyl in your Vessels, and your Lamps burning, and are clothed with the long white Robes of Righteousness, and are adorned with the Ornaments of pure beauty and glorious brightness (abundance of you) to our joy and comfort; and we do pray night and day, That every Babe of our Heavenly Father's begetting may prosper, even as we desire our own souls should prosper; and that every one may be kept out of incumbrances, and use the World as if they used it not; but every one's mind, spirit, heart and soul, may be exercised in the Eternal, by the Power of God, out of the earthly, and out of the visible, out of the carnal and perishing things of this life (so as to trust in it) in∣to the heavenly, into the spiritual, into the
<PB N="138" REF="81" MS="y"/> invisible, into that which never changeth, fadeth, nor waxeth old, where every one may dwell in the enjoyment of the pre∣sence of the Lord; for in the presence of the Lord is fulness of joy, and at his right hand is pleasure for evermore. Oh, that every one may be emptied of your selves, and unbottomed of your selves, that you may build wholly upon the sure foundati∣on, and anchored so fast upon the Rock of Ages, that neither the swelling Seas, nor the foaming Waves, nor stormy Winds, though they beat vehemently, may ever be able to remove you. Oh dear Brethren, in the life and power you may feel the issues of Love and Life, which stream as a Ri∣ver to every soul of you, from the hearts of us that are wholly joyned to the Foun∣tain; Glory and everlasting Praises be given to his holy Name. Our whole souls, spirits, hearts and minds, are given up to serve the Lord in whatsoever he requireth of us, as he shall make it manifest unto us: And we do blesse his Name for ever, that he hath found us worthy of so high a calling, as to bind Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters of Iron. Our prayers are continually for the advancement of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus throughout
<PB N="139" REF="81" MS="y"/> the whole Earth, for the gathering of the Seed of the Elect of God, and for the rai∣sing of it up over the Seed of the Serpent, in power and great glory, to bear rule, and to have dominion over the whole World, that the Kingdoms of this World, may become the Kingdoms of our Lord Jesus, that he may rule in his Princely Power, and reign in his Kingly Majesty, whose Right it is; that the knowledge of the Lord may cover the Earth, as the Wa∣ter covereth the Sea; that all the Children of the Lord may be taught of the Lord, and be established in Righteousness; that so the Mourners in <HI>Sion</HI> may rejoyce, and the heavy-hearted in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> may be right glad: The Lord God of Power hasten it for his own Name's sake, and for his Elects sake, that lye in captivity under the hands of the dark powers of the Earth, either spiritual or temporal; <HI>Amen, Amen,</HI> saith our spirits.</P>
<P>Dear and precious Friends and Brethren, pray for us, that we may finish our Testi∣mony to the glory of God, and to the praise of his holy Name, and to the comfort of all that love his appearing, and to our own eternal salvation, and to the shame and confusion of all that hate the Lord Jesus,

So in the pure Unity of the Covenant of Light, Life, Peace, Love, and everlasting Righteous∣ness, do we take our leaves of you all at this time, hoping and believing we shall see your faces once again, before we go hence, and be no more seen. Dear Friends, pray for us.</P>
<P>Though we were in many straits and hardships by reason of the oppression; yet whilst our minds were staid upon the Foun∣tain, we saw no want; but our tender Fa∣ther, whose heavenly eye was ever over us, saw our necessities, sent his right dear and precious Servant, and just and faith∣ful Steward, <HI>Daniel Baker,</HI> to administer to our Necessities both spiritual and tem∣poral; he came not in his own time, will nor strength, but in the Will and Time, Strength and Power of the Almighty God; at whose presence the Mountains were re∣moved, the tall Cedars were made to bow, the strong Oaks to stoop. Oh wonderful! He went to the Lord Inquisitor (the Popes Deputy) to demand our lawful Liberty, which would not be granted, unless he and we would write to <HI>Messaena,</HI> or <HI>Legorn,</HI> to some <HI>English</HI> Merchant, to be engaged for four thousand Dollers: Which Propositi∣on
<PB N="141" REF="82"/> being out of the Covenant of Light, we durst not stoop to it; but our dear Brother in Christ Jesus offered his body for our Li∣berty, but it would not be granted; no∣thing would serve but one to engage for four thousand Dollers to be paid, if ever we come into these parts again. Then in obedience to the Lord he offered up his Life for our Freedom, but all would not serve; the Will of our God be done.</P>
<P>Oh dear Friends! greater Love was ne∣ver heard of, than for a man to lay down his Life for his Friend: Oh! it is worthy to be recorded in remembrance of him for ever; here he came up and down to admi∣nister to us with his Life in his hand, time after time. So the Lord God of Power reward him double into his bosome for ever. Oh! how did he refresh our souls, spirits, minds and bodies through great tri∣als, which is never to be forgotten.</P>

<HEAD>A short Relation of some more of their exceeding great Tryals and Tempta∣tions.</HEAD>
<P>NOw in short time after we were taken Prisoners, we were stung with Flyes called <HI>Muskatoes,</HI> in our faces &amp; our heads, as we lay in our Beds, that were swollen as if we had the small-Pox, so that all people were afraid of us, save the <HI>English</HI> Consul; they thought we had been unclean persons, so that a Friar told <HI>Sarah</HI> he saw an evil Spirit in her face, which was a great tryal; they could not sleep in their beds in the house, they were so tormented; and we were told, that they had seen them that did pray and preach every day, were burnt for Witches in a short time; and they would keep us to see our lives &amp; conver∣sations; and so they have: And glory be to our God, they cannot lay guilt to our charge, but are made to confess the Truth.</P>
<P>In a few dayes after we were there, in a Vision in the night, the Lord appeared to me, and shewed me, that round about us,
<PB N="143" REF="83"/> and above and beneath us, there were ma∣ny Magicians of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> and the Lord smote me, and said unto me, <HI>The Devil hath desired to winnow you as Wheat; but pray that your Faith fail not.</HI> And the sight was very dreadful and terrible; and the Voice of the Lord did awake me with much trembling and amazement, and a great War, for the space of twelve hours, before I could get the victory; and we did witness but little ease to the flesh night nor day. We went in obedience to the Lord to one of their Tower-Houses, in time of their Worship, and stood trem∣bling in the midst of them; and I was made to turn my back to the high Altar, and kneel down, and lift up my voice in prayer unto the Lord; and he that was say∣ing Service, drew off his Surplice, and kneeled a little beside us till I had done, and he reacht forth his hand to us, to come to him, and offered me a token; and the Lord shewed me it was the Mark of the Beast; and I refused it; and he put it in∣to <HI>Sarah</HI>'s hand, and she gave it him again, and shewed him her Purse, that she had to give, if any had need. And he asked if we were <HI>Calvinists</HI> or <HI>Lutherans?</HI> And we said, Nay: And he asked if we would go
<PB N="144" REF="84" MS="y"/> to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope? But we denied. And he asked if we were <HI>Catholicks?</HI> And we told him, We were true Chirstians, the Servants of the living God. And many of them were amazed, and came round about us; we having but little of their Tongue, gave our Testimony (for the Lord) in words and signs, as well as we could; and they were made subject to the Power at that present, praises be given to our God, and we departed in peace.</P>
<P>And since that, the Lord laid such a hea∣vy burthen upon us, that we did question what he would do with us, before we knew the mind of God in it. And upon a set-day they had a great Meeting to take their holy Sacrament (as they call it) in a high place; but we knew nothing of it, nor where it was, but what the Lord revealed to us: And we were made to go in, and stand in the midst; and there were many lights in divers places, &amp; many Christs, as they call them, and much costliness and a∣bominations of the Earth; they had so many sorts of holy Garments (as they call them) of so many colours, that it would make one wonder how the Devil did invent it. And there we were made to stand in the midst for the space of three parts of an
<PB N="145" REF="84"/> hour, as near as I can judge, in great pow∣er, trembling and quaking, and bitter mourning, so that they were all amazed, and some removed further for fear, but knew not what to do; for I never did wit∣ness such an Earthquake. In the end one came soberly, and spake to us to go forth; and we went in the Lord's time, and sate at the door trembling and mourning, to the astonishment of them; and being so overcome with their Abominations, we went along the street reeling to and fro, and staggering like drunken men, so that we were a wound to all that saw us: It was the wonderful Power of God that made way for us to go forth to them, and kept us. They have used all the Craft they have day and night, to inchant us, as the Lord hath made it known unto us; Glory and praises be to his everlasting Name for evermore. We know that there is no In∣chantment against <HI>Jacob,</HI> nor divination against <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Dearly beloved Friends, We dearly sa∣lute you all in the invisible Life of our God, who is our life, our peace, our stay and strength; under whose Shadow we are refreshed; praises, glory and honor be gi∣ven
<PB N="146" REF="85"/> unto his powerful Name, of all his, for ever.</P>
<P>Truly Friends, we are not able to de∣clare the large Mercies of our God, vouch∣safed unto us from time to time; his Horn is our Strength, and his Name our strong Tower in all our troubles, temptations, tryals and sufferings; he is a God at hand, and not afar off, and doth make us sensi∣ble before-hand, by Visions and Revelati∣ons, what is coming upon us; and doth arm us with his own Armour, and makes us as bold as Lyons; for we fear not the face of man, because we know we shall not suffer any thing but what shall make for the glory of our God: But truly we had fainted long ago, had not the Lord upheld us by his free Spirit; but we know the Lord taketh care of the least of them that trust him; Praises be unto him for ever. Dear Friends, though we be absent in bo∣dy, yet we are present in spirit, and do feel you in that which cannot be separa∣ted, as we abide faithful, and are much refreshed in you; and the remembrance of you is precious unto us: Oh, that all our Friends could prize the company and the sight of each others faces. We do not want the company of Friars, Jesuites and Ma∣gistrates,
<PB N="147" REF="85" MS="y"/> nor great women. Here are some that have breathings after Life, but they dare not shew it; for the same thing that was, is; they will not enter in them∣selves, nor suffer them that would.</P>
<P>The Lord Inquisitor sent to us, That if we would (being we are good women) we should go into the Nunnery amongst the holy women, and be maintained as long as we live, in regard we have denied the world, and all that we have. And the Friar told us, if we would come to their Masse-house, and receive their holy Sacrament, we should be the most eminent Catholicks in all <HI>Malta.</HI> But we denied them in the Name of the Lord, and all their dead fop∣pery which they have invented. Here we are kept under the Inquisition, as they say, till they have Orders from the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> what they should do with us.</P>
<P>We beseech you all, faithful Friends, pray for us, for great are our tryals: Did you but know the Abominations that the Devil hath invented here, you would think it were tryal enough. But here we have cruel mockings; and the same contra∣dictions, tryals and temptations that ever the Servants of the Lord had, and Christ himself. It is the wonderful Power of
<PB N="148" REF="86"/> God that we are preserved till this time; for all the whole Island are Papists, and given up to Idolatry. We are despised of all People, and abhorred of all Nations; and because they cannot have any just thing against us, they do invent lies against us: but the Lord is on our side, for else the Enemy would soon destroy us; for great is their rage; and we have continual war with them, night and day we feel: be∣hold their threatnings and cruelty is more than our tongues can express. Great is the love of our God, for he doth refresh us with the sweet drops of his mercy, and doth water us every moment with the everlasting springs of his Love, or else we had fainted long ago.</P>
<P>Oh! let all who know the Lord, praise and glorifie his holy Name for ever and ever, <HI>Amen.</HI> Dear Friends, farewel in the Lord.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>From us who are in outward bonds in the City of <HI>Malta,</HI> for the Testimo∣ny of <HI>JESUS,</HI> Glory be to his Name for ever, who hath counted us wor∣thy. We are in health at present, blessed be God.</DATELINE>

<HEAD>Several other Writings to <HI>D. B.</HI> whilst he was in <HI>MALTA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OH thou tender-hearted one, whom our God and our eternal Father hath sent to relieve us his poor innocent Lambs, in hard bondage, and deep capti∣vity, which thou art an eye-witness of; none can receive or discern it, but those that do see it: But our heavenly Father, who hath respect to the rest of them that believe in his Name, hath sent thee to be an eye-witness in some measure, of what we have undergone.</P>
<P>Oh my dear, precious and endeared one! thou meek Lamb, thou innocent Dove, who dost bear the likeness, beauty and brightness of that unspotted One that is come in the Volumn of the Book to do the Will of God: We can give in our Testi∣mony for thee, that thou camest here in the Power &amp; Authority of the Most High, to which the tall Cedars were made to bow, and the strong Oaks to bend; praises, praises be given to our everlasting God for evermore.</P>
<PB N="150" REF="87" MS="y"/>
<P>Oh my dearly beloved Brother, thy beauty shineth indeed, thou art all glori∣ous within and without; thy Garments are perfumed with all delightsom scents; We smell the sweet Odours thereof, and do feel the fulness of Love and Life which runs from thy tender heart day and night to us, and in the same Unity of <HI>Love</HI> do our hearts stream forth to thee, as thou knowest full well: Oh how have our hearts and bowels been melted for thee! our heads and eyes have run with tears, and our souls have been poured forth to our heavenly Father for thy preservation, and we did truly labour to see thy face before thou camest: Glory and praises be given to our Eternal <HI>Lord God, Amen,</HI> saith our spirits; that he doth vouchsafe us so great a mercy, as to behold the face of so preci∣ous a Friend. We do beseech God to mo∣derate us with his Eternal Spirit, that we may alwayes be mindful of his mercies, and never to let his benefits slip out of our minds. We have been near death many times, when we had none to come near us, but those that preached death and de∣struction to us; I have lain twelve dayes, or more, in a fast, in strong travel night and day, that my dearly beloved Yoke∣mate
<PB N="151" REF="87" MS="y"/> would have been glad if the Lord would have taken me out of the body, be∣cause of my great affliction.</P>
<P>Then the English Friar which was here, came up and down to us, and would say to my Friend, <HI>She is ready to depart; send for me, and take notice what tormentt she will be in; a thousand Devils will be about her, to fetch her soul to Hell, because she will not be a Catholick.</HI> And after we were parted, we were called to fast, so that my Friend was so weak, that she put on such linnen upon her head, as she thought to lie in in her Grave: We did eat but little in a month together, when our money was almost done, till we did know the mind of the Lord what to do. Then thy did run to and fro like mad men, and the Friars did come and say, The Inquisitor sent them to tell us, we might have any thing we would eat; and they did say, it was not possible that e∣ver creatures could live with so little meat for so long a time together. They did bring us meat, and say, the English Consul did send it. It was a glorious Fast indeed, the Lord did appear wonderfully in it, praises be given to him for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>We were very weak, because the power did work so strongly; I had no manner of food
<PB N="152" REF="88"/> in my body five or six days together; We did lie in our clothes, because we had no strength to put them off, nor one to make our bed: Then we did speak to the Friar, that we might come together; but he said they had no such order; if we would have a Physician, we might. And there we lay, none knowing from morning to morning whether we were dead or alive. We were kept quiet and still till the Lord's time was come; they brought many things for us to eat: Then the Lord said, <HI>Thou mayest take as freely as if thou hadst la∣boured for it with thy hands; I will san∣ctifie it to thee through the Cross.</HI> And he said unto <HI>Sarah, <HI>she should eat of the fruit of her hands, and be blessed.</HI></HI> And we did eat, and were refreshed, and glori∣fied the Lord; We did cry mightily unto the Lord night and day, that we might not eat nor drink to offend him, we would ra∣ther dye. The Lord was well pleased with our Sacrifice, and did increase our strength, and administred comfort to us; honor and glory be to his blessed Name for ever. In the lowest of all our conditions, we were kept a top of all the mountains, so that they could not make us shrink or bow one jot or tittle to any of their Precepts or
<PB N="153" REF="88"/> Commands. Yet the Friars have com∣manded us in the name of their god to kneel with them in prayer.</P>
<P>The time is too little for me to disclose the twentieth part of the terrible tryals; but whensoever we were brought upon any tryal, the Lord did take away all fear from us, and multiplied our strength, and gave us power and boldness to plead for the Truth of the Lord Jesus, and wisdom of words, to stop the mouthes of the gain∣sayers, that they would be made to say, We spake Truth; they could never say o∣therwise: But they would say, <HI>We had not the true Faith, but we had all Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>Oh dear heart! if it be our Eternal Fa∣thers good pleasure to carry thee away without us, we do beseech our heavenly Father to bless, and give thee a prospe∣rous return, and to feed thee with the fulness of the blessing of the powerful Go∣spel of the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Amen.</HI> And we do believe we shall not want thy pray∣ers, nor the prayers of all the Faithful, that we may keep faithful to the end; so that our God may be glorified, his Church and People may be refreshed and rejoyced, and we may receive our Reward with the rest of the Lord's Lambs.</P>
<PB N="154" REF="89"/>
<P>Our Life is with the; for oh! thou art full of Love, thou tender-hearted one, who hast offered up thy sanctified body, and pu∣rified life, in obedience to the Lord, for us poor afflicted Lambs with thee, and com∣panions in tribulations, trials and persecu∣tions, and in perils at Sea, and perils by Land. Oh thou precious Lamb of God, great is thy reward in Heaven, great will be the Well-spring of joy that will arise in thee, in thy Journey: Oh thou happy one indeed! whom the Lord our God hath made choice of amongst his faithful Flock, and en∣dued with so much power to come into such a place as this, not the like in all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> by their own report, and all others, and to stop the mouths of Lyons, and to trample upon the heads of Serpents, Scor∣pions and Vipers of the Earth, and they could not hurt thee; their stings are taken out of their heads, and out of their tails; Glory, Honour and everlasting Praises be given to our God for evermore, of all that know him, for he is worthy.</P>
<P>And the Lord bless thee and thine for ever <HI>Amen,</HI> and encrease thy strength, and multiply thee abundantly in every good Gift and Grace, and prosper all thy un∣dertakings,
<PB N="155" REF="89"/> that thou mayest be approved for ever before the King of Saints, in the General Assembly of the Most High, and stand before the Throne of his Majesty with joy unspeakable, and full of glory; <HI>Amen, Amen,</HI> saith our spirits.</P>
<P>Dearly beloved pray for us, that we fall not, nor fail, whereby our Enemies may have any advantage to rejoyce, and say, We served a God that could not save us, and called upon a God that could not deli∣ver us; as if we were like them, to call upon stocks, stones, pictures, and painted walls, and dead things, that cannot see, hear nor speak through their throats. We do be∣seech thee to tell all our dear Friends, Fa∣thers and Elders, the Pillars of the spiri∣tual Building, with all the rest of our Chri∣stian Brethren, that we do desire their Prayers, for we have need of them.</P>

<P>LEt <HI>E. C.</HI> know, that his Exhortations I do dearly imbrace, and do witness it to be an eternal Truth. I have had large experience of it, the Lord hath carried me on in much difficult service, so that many times the way hath been stopt up, that to the eye of Reason I could not have a way made either by Sea or Land: Oh! if thou didst but know what experience I had of the mighty hand of the Lord in making a way, thou wouldst wonder. Once my way was stopt, and my persecution was
<PB N="157" REF="90"/> so hot, that I sate in a Field all night to wait upon the Lord, to make way for me to do the work he laid upon me? I could not get lodging for money in the Town nor City; it was at <HI>Salisbury</HI> where I was whipt in the Market. And the next morning I went through the City by the Watchmen, and they took no notice of me. Where∣soever the Lord did send me, into what Land, or City, or place soever, if they did put me out never so oft, he would make me go till I got victory; save in the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> there was a Souldier came to my Bed side with a naked Sword, and took me by the Arm, and hall'd me out of the Bed at the tenth hour of the night, and carried me on Ship-board: When I put on my clothes I did not dare to rise. That place lies upon me yet; and I have motions to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I was never there. The Lord did make me to do him service to almost all the mighty men in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> insomuch that I cryed oft to my God, saying, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou do with me that am so foolish, to go to such wise men! If I were wise, I did not care if thou didst carry me to the end of the Earth.</HI> The Lord said, <HI>The foolish things must con∣found the wise; and he would carry me
<PB N="158" REF="91"/> before the mightiest men in all the earth, to bear his Name before them, and I should have victory wheresoever I went:</HI> And I do believe the Lord, and we both are made willing to wait the Lord's time, which is a time of peace and joy, safety and happiness. And we do bless, laud, praise and magnifie his holy Name, that he sent so heavenly a Messenger to relieve, strengthen, comfort and refresh us in our great necessity, which is a mercy beyond expression; all Friends that do understand it, will say so: Glory and everlasting praises, honour, power and dominion be given to our eternal Lord God for ever∣more, of us, and all that know him. <HI>Amen, Amen,</HI> saith our Spirit.</P>
<P>Oh true and Faithful Brother, into the Arms of everlasting Power and Holiness, Strength and Mightiness, Purity &amp; Righ∣teousness, do we commit thee to be kept and preserved, and prosperously carried on in thy Journey: The powerful blessing, peace, joy and happiness of the Majesty of the Most High God go along with thee, to preserve and protect thee for ever. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Pray for us, dear Heart, that we may re∣cive strength to overcome, that we may
<PB N="159" REF="91"/> sing the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Lamb, and the Redeemed of the Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Heart, it is hard for us to part with thee; thou wilt feel it.</P>
<P>The Will of our eternal Father be done: In the pure Unity of the blessed Spirit of Light, Life, Joy, Peace, and everlasting Glory do we here take our leave of thee at this time, hoping to see thy face again with joy in our Lord's time.</P>
<P>O dear Heart! our hearts, souls, spi∣rits, and our whole lives go along with thee.</P>

<P>THou hast cleared thy Conscience to∣wards us in the sight of God and man; if here had been many Friends, what could have been done more concerning us than thou hast done? Thou hast stood in great jeopardy ever since, and thy life hath been
<PB N="160" REF="92" MS="y"/> sought for much; We have felt it, and cry∣ed night and day to our heavenly Father to preserve thee, and safely deliver thee: Whatsoever we do suffer, we desire the Will of our heavenly Father to be done in all things. If the Lord doth stir up the Earth to help the Woman, it is his own free love; and upon that account we shall receive it, and not upon any other.</P>
<P>This they spake concerning the Money I left with them, and for their necessities: And the Lord did appear unto me in a Vi∣sion of the night, and smote me on the arm, and said, <HI>Look, there is the Pope, he will not hurt thée;</HI> where he stood in the room as one forsaken of God and man; this was at the English Consuls, when there was some fear upon me concerning him. Now here is a <HI>Roman</HI> in the Prison which came hither upon some account, he is a Doctor of Law, and differs from them in many things; but they are all of one spirit: He doth constantly affirm, that the Pope hath sent an Order to set us free; and he saith, they are liars and false blasphemers, if they do say the Pope sent any such Order as they speak of. They do meet every day con∣cerning us, we do feel them; some would have it one way, and some another, and so
<PB N="161" REF="92"/> they cannot agree, because they do act contrary to the Will of God; the Lord sets it all on fire, and hath burned all that they have done these three years concerning us. Now where they will look a Reward of their charges, we do not know; <HI>the wise are taken in their own craftiness, and the sub∣tile in their own snare.</HI> There have twelve of them sate in Judgement upon us three years, and some have struck hard at our lives, so that we have been even at deaths door. I have lain very weak three weeks at a time. There are many for us, as far as they do dare. The Lord sayes, there were two with the Inquisitor for us, and did plead much with him: I did see it in a Night-Vision. The English Consul which is dead, was with us two several times after we were in the Inquisition; he said he would lend us five pounds when we did want: but when our Money was near done, we were made to rejoyce great∣ly, and could not take any of any one. We did not know the mind of the Lord in it; but had we had Money, we had not known the mighty Power of God. Now we are able to trust the Lord where-ever he shall carry us without money. We do question the Money in the Consul's hand,
<PB N="162" REF="93"/> it will be hard for him to part with it. Our life is with thee.</P>

<P>DEar and precious heart, in the Eternal Covenant of Light and Life of our God, do we salute thee, and dearly embrace thee. Oh! what hath the Lord made thee un∣to us, far more precious than we are able to express; and great will be thy Reward for thy faithfulness to the Lord, and thy dear and tender Love to us, and thy diligent care of us. Oh! thou art the Messenger we have cried long for, to our Heavenly Father, saying, How long, O Lord, How long will it be before thou wilt send thy Messenger, whose feet are beautiful, coming upon the Mountains, bring∣ing glad-tydings of great joy to us thy poor Captives? Now hath the Lord our God an∣swered us at large; Praises, Praises be to his Name for evermore.</P>
<P>Oh! how are our souls refreshed, and our spirits supported, and our hearts comforted, our minds rejoyced, and our bodies strength∣ned; thou canst never do greater service to the Lord our God, than to come into such a place as this is, to offer up thy dear Life in ransoming us: Great was the Power that
<PB N="165" REF="94"/> brought thee, and great is the Power that doth uphold thee, and mighty is the Strength which doth preserve thee, and great will be thy Re∣ward: Thy labour of Love we do bear Testi∣mony cannot be forgotten, nor thy Faith un∣feigned put out of remembrance; it is writ∣ten in the Book of Life for ever, and it will be registred and read in the House of Israel eternally: The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and he will perform it. Farewel in the Lord. By us,</P>

<HEAD>Another Letter from <HI>Sarah Cheevers,</HI> to Friends in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be read among the Assemblies of Saints in Light.</HEAD>
<P>OH! all ye righteous Ones▪ whose dwellings are on high, in the Fulness of beau∣ty, holiness and glory, whose Name and Fame reacheth to the ends of the Earth, to the asto∣nishment of the Heathen, and the amaze∣ment of the Ungodly; to the preparation of all Nations to appear before the dreadful Pre∣sence of our Lord God Almighty, to be stript of all false coverings, and to be left without excuse: Glory and Praises be to our God for
<PB N="167" REF="95"/> ever, <HI>Amen;</HI> who hath made us eye-witnesses of his mighty Work, and helpers together with you, according to our measures, to the chaining down of the Powers of darkness, and to the defacing of that painted Harlot, <HI>My∣stery Babylon,</HI> with all her Lovers, to the utter overthrow of Antichrist, with all his wicked Kingdom, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>The day is dawning, the Sun of Righte∣ousness is arising over all Nations, for to make a clear separation, to gather in his own Flock, and to scatter the proud in the imaginations of their own hearts, to feed the hungry, to heal the sick, and to bind up the broken hearted, to cloath the naked, to visit the spirits in prison, and comfort the Mourners in <HI>Sion,</HI> to cause the heavy-hearted in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to rejoyce.</P>
<P>Oh my dear Friends! who are precious in the sight of our Heavenly Father, partakers of his Divine Nature, living Stones, and ho∣ly Assemblies; wherein dwelleth the fulness of God Almightie's Power and Strength; Riches, Glory, Wisdom, Counsel, Knowledge and Understanding; he is the Rock of Ages, the sure Foundation, the Ark of the Cove∣nant of the Promise of everlasting Blessed∣ness, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>My dear and precious Ones, whom my soul loveth, my heart delighteth in you, and my
<PB N="168" REF="96"/> spirit rejoyceth greatly because of the excel∣lency of God's Almightiness amongst you, so that you are a dread to the Nations; Kings, Princes, and mighty Men of the Earth shall bow before the Power of Almighty God; by whom we stand, and all shall be brought under the Foot-stool of Christ &amp; his Government, and he alone shall reign in Righteousness, and rule the Nations in Judgement; then shall the cry of the Poor be heard, and the sighing of the Needy be eased, and the yoke of Wickedness be broken, and the Oppressed shall be set free; the Image of Christ restored, and the Image of that subtile Serpent defaced, destroyed, and utterly cast down for ever, <HI>Amen;</HI> so saith my spirit: Glory, honour, laud and praise be given to our Lord God Almighty, for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>A sweet Salutation is this, from the brea∣thing forth of my pure Life, to the same Life; in my Spirit, joyning in my measure, a suffer∣er for the Seeds sake; Glory to the Lord, who hath counted me worthy: Farewel, farewel my dear hearts. My dear Yoke-mate <HI>K. E.</HI> dearly salutes all Friends.</P>
<P>Oh ye holy Assemblies! whose hearts are wholly joyned to the Lord, I with you, in the Life and Power of the Almighty God, do tra∣vel for the raising of the Seed, and the ga∣thering
<PB N="169" REF="96"/> in of the lost Sheep of the House of <HI>Israel.</HI> Oh! blessed be the Day wherein the Lord called me, and counted me worthy to suf∣fer for the Seeds sake: Praise, praise the Lord for me ye blessed of the Lord, in whom the living Praises are found in the living Fountain of God Almighty, the Fulness that filleth every empty soul, in the Streams of Love, Life, Light, Strength, Riches, Im∣mortality, and Eternal Glory. So Truth, Joy, Peace and everlasting Blessedness remain with you all for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>My Life is given up for the Service of the Lord; Bonds, Chains, Bolts, Irons, Double-doors, Death it self is too little for the Testi∣mony of Jesus, and for the Word of God; so the Seed be gathered, it is but a reasonable Sa∣crifice: Bonds and Afflictions betide the Gos∣pel of Christ; <HI>He that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer Persecution;</HI> it is an evident token.</P>
<P>My dear Friends, my Light, my Life, my Love hath perfect Union in the Eternal Spirit of the living God, and remains with you all for ever; Fathers, Elders, Pillars, Nursing-Mothers in <HI>Israel,</HI> true <HI>Israelites</HI> indeed, in whom is no guile.

<P>NOw after I had received these Papers, though not through little straits and difficulty, with jeopardy of my precious Life, which my God sweetly through all preserved, Glory to his Name: my heart was, as it were, overcome with the loving-kindness and salvation of the living Lord, and in his savory Life my mouth was filled with thanksgiving and praises to my God; and I said in my heart on this wise, Who am I, O Lord, or what was my Father's House, or what is the Land of my Nativi∣ty, that I (a poor: afflicted and despised Worm) should be raised up to see and perceive what mine eye, mine eye in thy Eternal Power and pure Life beholds!

<HEAD>Here followeth somewhat relating to the Travel and Service of <HI>D. B.</HI> which he hath freedom to give forth for the Truth's sake, and Friends satisfa∣ction.</HEAD>
<P>THE intent of the Spirit of the Lord within my heart and mind, stirring me up to write somewhat concerning my travel from my Native Country, Kindred
<PB N="177" REF="100"/> and Father's House, being freely given up to serve the Lord, his Truth and People, in the Power and Gospel of God; I ha∣ving no imposition or necessity at all laid upon my Conscience, as from any mortal man, but certainly it was a pure necessity from the living God of Heaven &amp; Earth; many of his faithful Servants, Messengers, Sons and Daughters that were, and are as dear and precious to me as my own life, may bear me record on the Lord's behalf unto the truth of what I write on this wise; and surely in the Counsel everla∣sting, the thing was hid from me then, whether ever I should return to my Native Country or not. However, in the love and favour of God, and in his fear set up within my heart, was I given up, with my body also offered as a living Sacrifice, which was but my reasonable sacrifice, to give a sound to the Nations afar off, of the mighty Day of our God, and his blessed Truth, the Light of Jesus manifest in eve∣ry Conscience, in which Light we have most assuredly believed unto salvation: And verily the Power and pure Presence of his Eternal Strength was with me, through many hardships, trials and tribula∣tions; the right-hand of the hiding of his
<PB N="178" REF="101" MS="y"/> Power did sweetly guide, strengthen &amp; sup∣port me, even as it did, and doth his Lambs whom he so sends forth as among Wolves, in his Dove-like Innocency, harmles∣ness and wisdom, which are as wise, or ra∣ther wiser than the Serpents. And this Scripture have I well witnessed fulfilled, whilst travelling from one Nation to ano∣ther People, as my Father did in the anci∣ent dayes. And on this wise, with three more Brethren, so freely given up with one consent in the behalf of the Gospel ever∣lasting, that is now preaching again to the Nations, Tongues and Kindreds.</P>
<P>We set forward the 16th. of the third Month, and we sweetly parted with our right dearly beloved Friends, Brethren, Fathers and near Relations, that were flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, and from all our outward Acquaintance and Native Country, in the Will, Love and Spirit of our God, in the same day from <HI>Gravesend</HI> we set forth; and at the end of forty four dayes, we arrived at <HI>Legorn</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> where we gave a certain sound of our innocent Service and Message of Salvati∣on, and of its Life and Blessedness, co∣ming upon the Nations as a weight either to condemnation or justification, as the
<PB N="179" REF="101"/> same is received or rejected among them.</P>
<P>And thus as we had opportunity, among the men of our own Nation, the <HI>Jews</HI> and others, we gave a sound, and the blessing of the God of Heaven, and his Presence was with us, whether the Nations of men did hear or forbear; but the Witness of God in sundry was reached, and the same an∣swered in us: And herein we are so far well satisfied, whilst others were hardened, who defied us and our Testimony, as their uncircumcised Fathers always did resist and gain-say the Truth that saves from sin, and so finally from its condemnation.</P>
<P>And it came to pass, after that we had waited upon the Lord to understand his good will and pleasure, he answered us in the joy of our hearts, and we received his Counsel, and communicated of the same to each others satisfaction in the love of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n which we were wel confirmed to obey the same until the death, as the Lord our God might have permitted for his Names sake, who then further ordained us to be separated, <HI>viz. John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Henry Fell</HI> to pass on towards <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and, my dear brother and companion, <HI>Richard Scos∣trop,</HI> with me, to pass <HI>Eastward,</HI> to <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> in <HI>Asia;</HI> and after a
<PB N="180" REF="102"/> little season we parted in the goodness of God. And when twenty four dayes were finished, having (in the mean time) touched a little season at the Island <HI>Zant,</HI> we arri∣ved at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> But behold it came to pass, immediately at our coming, there was not a little stir, together with the evil sur∣mizings, and what else arising up as a flood, with threatnings breathed forth from the Apostate Christians, especially men of no small degree (of our own Na∣tion) against us, when <HI>Turks, Jews, Greeks, Heathens,</HI> and others, were not altogether so evil affect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, as to let us from the exer∣cise of our Conscience void of offence towards God and man, and so to hold forth the example of the harmless Life, and un∣blameable Conversation, in all equitable∣ness in Doctrine, Life and Practice of what we professed in the midst of them. But oh! how the Christians (by name) in <HI>Asia</HI> (who should first have received the Word of saving-health) how did they de∣fie and reproach not only us, but our living Testimony and Message of Blessedness, which day by day was sounded in their ears notwithstanding: The Lord God lay not what they did against us to their charge, when they have most need of mercy and
<PB N="181" REF="102"/> peace with God, if, happily, repentance unto life be witnessed by them, who know not what they did; yea, and my Spirit is ready to say, <HI>Amen,</HI> for their sakes that ha∣ted us without a cause, as the same unbe∣lieving nature did our Lord and Master, whom we love, serve and honour in the same, and therefore keep his Sayings, which are not grievous to us in that one and the selfe-same Spirit, which reproves the World for sin, in which we worship him as the Father; the which guideth into all Truth, from all Evil; concerning which we well admonished their minds to subject to the One, and to avoid and turn from the other, each having their proper effects at∣tending them, as anguish, woes, judge∣ments &amp; disquietments upon the soul and conscience that doth evil; and contrari∣wise, blessings, peace, glory, honor, and the goodness of God attending the soul of man which worketh good, in the Light of the same excellent Spirit of God which ex∣erciseth the Conscience in temperance and sobriety, meeekness and gentleness of Christ.</P>
<P>And on this wise we besought the men of our own Nation, together with many more in those parts, that they might become
<PB N="182" REF="103"/> a sweet savour of the pure Life of Christ and Christianity indeed and in truth, which tends to answer the Witness of the Eternal God, manifest in <HI>Turks, Greeks, Jews, Heathens,</HI> and Apostate Christians, among the dark Nations, where they have their conversation: Yet I am constrained to express somewhat of their manner of dealing with us to our good; Wherefore Men of reasonable and honourable under∣standing, may bear with me, to the end that the honest-hearted may be informed to be∣ware of a persecuting Spirit, which is not of God, neither ever was it born of him.</P>
<P>Their Threatnings encreased daily, and they burdened themselves exceedingly with us, whose Deportment and Behavi∣our they were made to confess to; as did the Consul and divers others; which in truth they could not say otherwise, but that it was temperate, innocent, harmless and unblameable in our Conversation; Mag∣nified be the Lord, and blessed be his Grace of Life, by which we in submission to the same, were guided herein: But because our Testimony was not for, but against whatsoever might be said in truth to be evil, unjust, or unequitable <HI>(which is dis∣honourable)</HI> therefore were we hated of the
<PB N="183" REF="103"/> High and Lofty, to the disquieting of their own rest day and night; because they bur∣thened themselves so with the truth and innocency of the Lord's Testimony, which our Life held forth among them who re∣ceived not the same in his love, that they might be saved not only from sin, but also from the wrath to come. So they forth∣with sent a Message from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to the great City <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to the King's Em∣bassador of <HI>England,</HI> and besought him to expel us out from among them of <HI>Asia,</HI> that we might not have a Being in the ex∣tent of their Authority, in visiting them on this wise, as by the annexed Warrant thou that reads the same, may understand.</P>

<P>And forthwith this Warrant was dis∣patcht with a Messenger from the Embas∣sador's Court at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and behold, the Merchants of the Earth, and others that could not endure to hear of the sound of Truth, received the same not with little gladness; (poor men! wo and alas for them!) the end of which will not be peace, but contrariwise, wo and misery: And they put the same Warrant in execution, and sent a <HI>Turkish</HI> Janisary, and a <HI>Drugerman,</HI> that were Officers un∣der the Consul of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; and they came with <HI>Harmols, (viz.</HI> called <HI>Por∣ters)</HI> with <HI>Cain's</HI> Weapons, and fetcht us from our Lodging before the Consul; and the man was courteous and moderate, and had his ear open then to what we in the re∣verence and fear of the Lord then said un∣to him, which was his honor, who then saw over and beyond that foolish Ceremo∣ny of the Hat, neither did he burthen him∣self with the same, as many unwisely do, to the clouding or veiling of the nobility of a good Understanding, which hath a more noble respect to Equity, Justice and Judgement, without respect of Persons in them, where it is set up in its proper and peculiar Authority, than to such foolish
<PB N="186" REF="105"/> Ceremonies, which are below men of Wis∣dom; yet he desired that we might not take it ill as from him (in his place of Au∣thority) in doing as he was obliged in the prosecution of the Warrant, which sum∣moned all Officers and Members of the Factory, with Masters &amp; Officers of Ships, to be aiding and assisting to surprize and banish two innocent, naked, harmless Men, that had neither Bow nor Sword, nor any such like material or visible Wea∣pon of War to resist evil, as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar∣nabus</HI> had not, against whom the hard-hear∣ted <HI>Jews</HI> cryed out with the same voice, <HI>Help men of Israel,</HI> &amp;c. and such like stir there was. And we let the Consul know at our first coming, that we owned his place of Authority, and were ready to sub∣mit to any thing that was just or equitable; and at last, in this thing, we could not sub∣mit without suffering, forasmuch as in the uprightness of our heart, and in the inno∣cency of the same, were we come so far to do the Will of God, and to suffer for it, as his hand permitted.</P>
<P>So with many other expressions I clear∣ed my Conscience, as also by Words, Suf∣ferings and Writings, to the whole Nati∣on there; and the Consul seemed to be
<PB N="187" REF="105" MS="y"/> unwilling to use violence against us, that at our departure we prayed for them that hated us without a cause, knowing not what they did; we seeing it could not at that season be otherwise, but what the Lord had permitted them to bring to pass, not to their justification, but as a Judgement among them from the living God, who did not onely dispence the visitation of his Love and Salvation day by day among them, but he visited them also with the strokes of his Displeasure, even unto death and destruction; and surely he smote and took away of the Chiefest, &amp; others of them daily: And verily my heart often cryed, and besought the Lord for them in secret more especially, (though I was constrai∣ned not to cease uttering my voice openly among them, and for them) while they sought my hurt; as many of them, I know, by the Witness of God in them may re∣member. And so we were sent away as Prisoners, or rather as Lambs driven from the Dens of Lyons, or from the barren Caves of ravening Wolves, whose nature worried them.</P>
<P>Now we had spoken for a passage by a <HI>Dutch</HI> ship, to have gone from thence to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but before the Ship depar∣ted
<PB N="188" REF="106"/> <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the Warrant came to the Con∣sul's hands, which thou mayest see came not from either them called <HI>Turks, Jews, Heathens, Greeks,</HI> or <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but even from the men of our own Nation. Alas! alas! yea, wo and alas for them.</P>
<P>So the Reader may see what a stir there hath been in the Region of <HI>Asia,</HI> against the appearance of Truth, and its Innocen∣cy, in plainness, to expel and banish it, together with its Message and Messengers, out of their Coasts or Borders, and not to have any entertainment, or at least to come within the extent of their Authority, what∣ever becomes of them, let them go where they will, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So as in effect they say, We will not have this man, the Light, Truth, Temperance, Innocency, its Life and Wisdom from above, to rule, or have its preheminence over us in our Consci∣ences; we will rather chuse to live in the practice of our own evil hearts and ways: And therefore thus to their own hurt, they say unto God, <HI>Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy Wayes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 21.</NOTE> <HI>and as for the Word of the Lord, we have no delight in it.</HI> Lo they have rejected the Word of the Lord, and what Wisdom is in them? And such
<PB N="189" REF="106"/> the holy perfect and upright Man saw rebel against the Light, and said, <HI>They are of those that rebel against the Light, they know not the Wayes thereof,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 24.13.</NOTE> <HI>nei∣ther abide in the Paths thereof.</HI></P>
<P>And so with consent they joyned toge∣ther to banish Truth, its Message and Mes∣sengers of Peace, which provoked them to jealousie that believed not, who scorned us as fools, and what not else, not honestly considering, how that God is provoking the Nations to jealousie and wrath with a foo∣lish People, as in the ancient dayes, <HI>Deut.</HI> 22. was prophesied. And such besought our Lord and Master, even Jesus, to de∣part out of their Coasts or Borders, who loved and fed their Swine upon the Moun∣tains; even the <HI>Gadarens</HI> besought him to depart; who saith, <HI>He that loveth Fa∣ther or Mother, or what else, more than Me, is not worthy of Me;</HI> and Father and Mo∣ther, and such Relations, are of more honourable esteem than many Swine. And to his Disciples he also saith (that was dead, and is alive, and liveth for ever) <HI>As they have done unto me, so will they do unto you; if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</HI> These are his faith∣ful and true Sayings; <HI>He that receiveth
<PB N="190" REF="107"/> you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 13.20.</NOTE> <HI>receiveth him that sent me;</HI> [Mark that:] <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, Whom∣soever receiveth whom I shall send, receiveth me; and him that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, de∣spiseth him that sent me.</HI> And it's to be un∣derstood, that such like dealing <HI>J. S.</HI> and <HI>H. F.</HI> our Brethren, found at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> from whom they also were banished.</P>
<P>And on this wise being rejected, despi∣sed, banished out of <HI>Asia,</HI> from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in about eight dayes we arrived at the Island <HI>Zant,</HI> where my dear Brother and Companion in sufferings, and not only so, but in the Kingdom &amp; patience of Christ, he was visited with sickness nigh unto death; but the Word and Commandment of the Lord ordered me to pass through part of <HI>Italy,</HI> and my face was set towards <HI>Venice;</HI> and we weighed the thing in the fear and counsel of the Lord, and were both given up in one to travel; yet it was so, that the poor Lamb was not capable in body to travel with me, by reason of weak∣ness; and he being fully perswaded and satisfied in his own mind, that I was to
<PB N="191" REF="107"/> pass onward, in the tender Love of our God he did the more constrain me; I fin∣ding some unwillingness to leave him in that condition, which was not a little cross unto me: But in the heavenly Will and Peace of our God, and joy of the Lord, out of all visibles we parted asunder; and it came to pass, that he laid down his Bo∣dy there in about two dayes after.</P>
<P>There being a Ship of <HI>Venice</HI> ready, I embarqued on the same, and had a good Passage through the Gulf of <HI>Venice.</HI> Af∣ter three Weeks were finished, was I ad∣mitted (together with the Ships company) to receive Product or Admission to come into the City, as their manner is; and there I continued about eight dayes as a sign and wonder among many, and gave somewhat of a sound of the Lord's Day (in truth) among them; and from thence I travelled to <HI>Legorn,</HI> and my face was as if it were set towards <HI>England,</HI> I being alone, as a Mourning-Dove in a desolate Wilderness: Yet it came so to pass when I arrived at the same Port or City, that the everlasting Love of my God did fill and overcome my heart, and mine eye right dearly affected the same; and verily the living Word and Commandment of my
<PB N="192" REF="108"/> God sounded in mine ear, and mine un∣derstanding was quickened in the Spirit of Life from God, so that I was made wil∣ling, and not to rebel against the Heaven∣ly Voice; [And what if I testifie, that mine eye saw the Angel of his presence?] which was expresly for me to give up, and pass away from thence, to visit his long-suffering Seed of Innocency, shut up in the Inquisition, in the Isle of <HI>Malta,</HI> under the Popes Authority, and to communicate to their necessities; and verily the sweet Promise of the Lord entered and possessed my heart, and my God made my way pro∣sperous; for in the Light of his Counte∣nance he had often set these poor afflicted long-suffering Innocents before my face: Wherefore my body and mind was freely offered up as my reasonable service, to serve his Truth, &amp; the least Member of it; and so to the death of the Cross, whereto I became obedient in uprightness of heart, as if I should never see the face of my Kindred or Native Country more. (a Vessel of <HI>France</HI> being ready to de∣part from thence East-ward) I embarqued thereon for the Isle of <HI>Cicilia</HI> to <HI>Masena,</HI> and from thence to the Isle of <HI>Malta</HI> in a Vessel of the said Island; and in my pas∣sage
<PB N="193" REF="108" MS="y"/> the Vessel did bear in to <HI>Syracuse,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> abode three dayes in his pas∣sage to <HI>Rome</HI> (after he had suffered ship∣wrack on <HI>Malta</HI>) and at <HI>Syracuse</HI> I abode five dayes, where I gave a sound of the Lord's Truth and Life: And so we imme∣diately sailed from thence, and within twenty four hours we arrived at the Island of <HI>Malta;</HI> and within some hours after I came upon the said Island, I had admit∣tance to the Pope's Lord Inquisitor, to whom I delivered my Message in the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> Tongue, on this wise, <HI>I am come to demand the just Liberty of my innocent Friends; the two English Women in Prison in the Inquisition:</HI> And he asked, If I were re∣lated to them as a Husband or Kinsman, and whether I came out of <HI>England</HI> on pur∣pose with that Message. And I answered, I came from <HI>Legorn</HI> for that same end; and he replied at last, They should abide in Prison till they dye, except some <HI>English</HI> Merchants or others that were able, would engage or give obligation for the value of three or four thousand Dollers, conditio∣nally, that they should never return again into those Parts.</P>
<P>On this wise was his reply divers times with the Consul and many others, together
<PB N="194" REF="109"/> and asunder; but in the Name and Fear of the Lord God I withstood the same un∣christian-like Demand and Cruelty, in the Word, Power and Travel of the Lord in his innocent suffering Lambs behalf; al∣beit, they daily threatned me with their Cruelty and Inquisition of darkness, and followed me to and fro with their Officer and Black-rod, and the Pope's Deputy would have bound me, that I should nei∣ther speak good nor evil to any one while I was on the Island, as the Consul said, save to him; neither to come to the Pri∣son alone, except the Consul came also with me, or some of his Family at least: But their Snares, Bonds and Covenants, in the Name of my God I defied, because the Spirit of Life from the Lord gave me dominion through sufferings in spirit, first, over their unjust dark Impositions; yea, and in the same good Authority, in the innocency and uprightness of my heart, I travelled through, and over the darkness, over its works, and ceased not to publish the end of my coming, which they would not have known abroad, and the sound of Truth; and its dread and fame struck ter∣ror in their hearts, that both high and wise, great Men, together with the popish Priests
<PB N="195" REF="109"/> and Jesuites, Knights, them called of the Nobility, of the Pope's Dominion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and of many Nations; they did not burthen themselves a little with my bodily presence, my clear Testimony and Friends in general, all which they de∣fied and withstood, as it doth appear by the words of Truth in this Treatse.</P>
<P>And thus it comes to pass among the Nations, because we are not of this world, as our Life and Testimony also is not for, but against the same; therefore we marvel not if the World hate us, knowing its birth which is from beneath, earthly and sensual, persecuteth that which is from a∣bove, heavenly and spiritual; and so the Lord hath made me as a burthensome stone among them. My heart blesseth his Name that wonderfully preserved me: Yet some of them came to see somewhat of my In∣nocency.</P>
<P>About twenty four dayes I abode upon the said Island, they daily continuing their Threatnings against me as aforesaid, and many times attempted me to take my Pas∣sage to <HI>Cicillia,</HI> or to some parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> to produce the unreasonable and unchristian-like Obligation demanded by them; but in the fear of God I, with my dear Friends,
<PB N="196" REF="110"/> withstood them, and they were freely gi∣ven up, rather to suffer, than to hurt Gods Truth and People thus to gratifie them; who (as it doth appear) the Spirit of the Lord God of Truth, rules neither in Pope, nor in any of his Lords, Priests or Jesuites, that exercise such Lordship over the Inno∣cent, long-suffering Heritage of the ever∣lasting God. The time hasteneth, and be∣hold it cometh to pass, that the weight of eternal Vengeance is coming over them, which the Man of Sin, and his Sons of Perdition will not be able to bear: For the doleful Cry of the Innocent, that sighs and groans with tears, hath long uttered its voice, which hath ascended into the ears of the Most High, who is higher than the Highest, yet hath he respect unto the needy, to uphold them, yea, and to such as are of an upright, contrite, lowly, and trembling heart: What if I should say, the God of Love and Long-suffering dwels in such? and verily their sacrifice is ac∣ceptable in his bosom that liveth for ever; and I am a living Witne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that the sweet Testimony &amp; innocent Sufferings of these his long-suffering Lambs, is right dear and precious in his eye, which is the Light of his Countenance; and so it is not other∣wise,
<PB N="197" REF="110"/> but the same in oneness with his peo∣ple concerning them.</P>
<P>And so in the endless mercy, blessing and peace of our God, we parted, and I came away with the love and peace of my God within my heart, having the answer and living testimony of a good Consci∣ence; and in the wisdom of God brought away these their Words and Writings, which testifieth somewhat of their Suffer∣ings and Faithfulness unto the Lord, his Truth &amp; People, which I right-well know, cannot be shut out of the Record of Life eternal, unto which I bear Record again, that they have been, and are a sweet sa∣vour unto the Lord God of Faithfulness, and so their Reward, which attends the same, is not only with them, but with all the Sons and Daughters of truth and inno∣cency, that are so travelling in their Long-sufferings, which are but light and momen∣tary in competition to the eternal weight of Glory, which afterward is to be revea∣led in the same that suffered in all gene∣rations, even from righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> unto this day of our God; to whom be Wisdom, Glory, Salvation, and everlasting Thans∣givings a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Dominion, for ever, <HI>Amen,</HI> saith my soul and spirit; even so, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<PB N="198" REF="111"/>
<P>And it came to pass in the third Month of the year, 1662. also after my God had well preserved me in my passage, and in his work and service from <HI>Malta</HI> to divers places in <HI>Italy,</HI> till I came to the Straits mouth (of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea) at the place called <HI>Gibralter,</HI> it was the pleasure of the Lord God to suffer the Wind and Weather to continue contrary well nigh about thirty dayes, in which season I suf∣fered many Trials and Tribulations in spi∣rit, having little or no Rest in the same, be∣cause of the Vision and Words of the E∣verlasting, which sounded often up to my understanding, even as the roaring of a Lyon, which mine eye saw, and mine ear heard also [in the year —61. when I was a Prisoner for the pure Word and Testi∣mony of God and his Truth, in <HI>Worcester</HI> City Jayl, before I departed <HI>England</HI>] and the place was the high Mountain of <HI>Gibral∣ter,</HI> that stands within the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Dominion, which was the subject of the Vision; and often as I cast mine eye up∣on the scituation of the place, the pure Life and Power of God's eternal Presence did arise up in me, in the word of life, so that I saw clearly that some great exceeding weighty service for his Name and eternal
<PB N="199" REF="111"/> Truths sake was to be done by me, which was so terrible and dreadful to me, when as I entred into reasoning, so that I was brought down even to the jaws of death in dust and ashes; and as <HI>Jonah</HI> turned his back upon <HI>Nineveh,</HI> the same temptation attended me also, to my wounding, before I could give up; for I fled often from the place to escape with my life from among such an unreasonable and bloody generati∣on, and the Lord would not be intreated to let such a bitter Cup pass unfulfilled, but behold with the sound and stroak of his e∣ternal Word, his Spirit of Life became awakened, quickned, and mightily revived in me, in his Wisdom, over all fear of the Nations of men; and the same brake through the snares and bonds of death, and over destruction, and the true Seed that mourned, cried, <HI>Not my Will, but thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven:</HI> and so it was a hard thing to part with little <HI>Isaac,</HI> which is received again in the Covenant of promise of Life, and that was offered up which fled so often (but at last was caught in a thicket:) When the Ships of divers Nations attempted to pass through, but the God of heaven, whom the wind and sea obeyeth, suffered them not; but
<PB N="200" REF="112"/> they knew not what the matter was which was revealed within my heart, as the dis∣pleasure of God was against them, to humble them also, as I told them often by words and writings to clear my Conscience; al∣beit, they strove, being perplexed in their minds, and attempted often, to wit, seven or eight times in about twenty one dayes, and could not pass but about two or three Leagues; and on this wise it happened, it would either prove calm, and then the currant would drive them back into the Straits again sometimes, and otherwhile Storms and Tempests would scatter them, as a figure of <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Hoste of Egyptian darkness, so that the Chariot-wheels mine eye saw struck off, so that they drove but heavily, within and with∣out; and at last I gave out among them, that God had service for me to do at that place, and my Life was given up to do his Will, if I never saw my Native Coun∣try, Kindred, or Fathers house at all any more; and therefore the pleasure of the Lord in his mighty Power had made me willing, &amp; also gave me dominion through and over the Bonds and Snares of Death and Destruction, as it were to lay down my precious Life, that I may take it again,
<PB N="201" REF="112" MS="y"/> together with the body, which through his righteous judgements he had prepared to perform the good pleasure of his Almigh∣tiness, for his Truth and Names sake. Now the heavenly Voice was often sounded within my heart on this wise, saying, <HI>O Jerusalem, cut off thine hair,</HI> and further∣more to <HI>gird sackcloth on my loins,</HI> as to the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.29. and so I became o∣bedient in the singleness and innocency of my heart, unto the God of Heaven, and of my Life, as a dreadful Sign against the whorish Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and against all her Heads &amp; Horns throughout the world: And I then signified to the Master of the Ship, in which I was a passenger, how that I did believe that God would soon give opportunity for the Fleet of Ships to pass away after this service of God was per∣formed; and after I had used many per∣swasions, to the end that he might suffer my body on that wise to be cast among the wicked idolaters, lyars and murtherers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 57.20.</NOTE> which are like the troubled Sea: So the Ship-master let my Body be on this wise cast over board from the Ship, [God having provided a <HI>Whale</HI> to swallow up that which fled from his presence so often] and
<PB N="202" REF="113"/> so it happened, that it was upon one of their called Holy-dayes, or Saints dayes, namely, the day called <HI>Holy-Thursday.</HI></P>
<P>So I being cast on dry land, passed through their streets directly, until I came into the Mass-House, or Idolaters Tem∣ple, among the Idolaters, where I found the Frier or Priest at the High Altar, down upon his knees, in his white Surplice, ado∣ring of the Host; (which is a <HI>Chalice,</HI> or a piece of Bread, which they called the real Substance of the body of Christ, after their unclean spirit of darkness hath mut∣tered some words over it, which they call <HI>Consecration</HI>) and after I had stood a season viewing this Idolatry, with the indignation of the eternal God set up with∣in my heart against the same, I turned my back-part upon the Priest, and his dead god, and dumb Idols, at the high Altar; and in the holy Commandment of Life e∣ternal, my face was set towards the people and I beheld them a certain season in the power of God in which I stood; I saw the multitude of ignorant People upon their knees also, worshipping the dark inventi∣ons and Imaginations of their sottish Lea∣ders, and blind Guides, and they know not what; and in the Lord's time (which mine
<PB N="203" REF="113"/> eye had a circumspect heed unto) I then spread forth mine arms, and stript off my Vesture, and rent the same from top to bot∣tom, in divers pieces, and cast them from me with indignation; and then I took my Hat off my head, (which was the upper∣most covering of the outside of a man) and cast the same under my feet, and stam∣ped upon these things, and the nakedness appeared with the sack-cloath covering, to their astonishment; and then with a clear voice I sounded Repentance three times, &amp; gave testimony as the sound of a Trum∣pet among them, that the Life of Christ and his Saints was arisen from the dead; and so passed away, sounding the same words of the Lord's Message, with Repen∣tance, through the streets, as it were flying from the Idols temple, and from Idolatry, and Idolaters, until I came to the Sea side, and there was I moved to kneel down and pray, and give thanks to the living Lord, who had so wonderfully preserved me in doing his pleasure and good will on earth; and he suffered no man to touch or do me harm.</P>
<P>And the next day following the Lord God gave opportunity accordingly as I had let the Ship-master know I believed
<PB N="240" REF="114"/> would come to pass, and it was so, and all the Fleet did partake of the blessing: but how many of them rewarded me (men of my own Nation, to whom I also conti∣nued a sign, which they spake bitter things against) the Lord my God saw the same, and smote them with rebuke and astonish∣ment in his displeasure; who in his wise determinate Counsel, ordained me for ma∣ny dayes &amp; nights to be tryed on this wise, and to fall among divers temptations af∣terwards, the which as a mighty Host sur∣rounded and beset me on every hand, im∣mediately after I had done his good will in his all-sufficient power and strength: Thus the Enemy with his subtilty, in a mystery, was suffered to compass me about, to steal away my peace and reward with my God, in whom the same is hid, and then I was in a blessed condition, though sometime vailed for a little season, and then the Fa∣thers Countenance was hid from mine eye, and therefore was I troubled: Yet, <HI>blessed are ye when you fall among divers Temptati∣ons,</HI> saith one; and verily they were even as thorns in my flesh, yea, as Messengers of Satan suffered to buffet me for a season; even as the Servant of God witnessed, who was wrapt up into the third Heaven: What
<PB N="205" REF="114"/> if I should somewhat testifie so was it with me, lest I should be exalted above mea∣sure, so that I was made to bow and fall upon my face, and cry day and night to the Lord of Eternal Life, that had respect to the tears of the Innocent, and bowed the strength of his Arm to support the Lowly: And so his Almightiness gave ear to the sighs and groans of my distressed state, and had respect unto the voice of my mour∣ning, as a Dove or Pelican in the Wilder∣ness; and verily his Grace I found suffi∣cient to save and preserve my Innocency, in its sweet life of holiness to the Lord, through all this, and that which letted; Salvation to his Name, <HI>Amen.</HI> So his strength is made perfect in weakness, even so it is in truth, in which I set to my seal of my right-hand, that God is true, in which Life I give thanks to his Name of Power and Defence, the which over all Nations is to be exalted in the hearts of his Saints, as in the ancient dayes; yea, and much more abundantly in the Light of his bright-shining Countenance, in which his eter∣nal and excellent Glory, and pure dreadful Majesty, for ever hath his holy habitation; to whom be endless Dominion, with Prai∣ses

<P>THe second month the year 1662. at the time of their Feast called the <HI>Re∣surrection of Christ,</HI> on the first day, we spake to the Keeper to buy us some meat,
<PB N="229" REF="116"/> not knowing but we might have eaten it in the time of their Feast; yet it had been laid upon us to fast most times when they did feast, which did torment them: for when we did fast in obedience to the Lord, they were greatly troubled: so the Keeper asked me, whether we would not eat meat to morrow, yea or nay? I was smote that I durst not say, but what the Lord will we shall do. When the morning came there was a great Triumph amongst them, and there sounded a Trumpet near us, in refe∣rence to the <HI>Lord Inquisitor.</HI> Immediatly the Word of the Lord came unto us, say∣ing, <HI>We must not eat Bread nor drink VVater in thrée dayes, nor I</HI> (K.) <HI>must not speak word in that time, but be silent and sit upon the ground in the</HI> Inquisi∣tion <HI>with very little clothes on; nothing upon our heads but ashes, no stoken nor shoe on;</HI> and the last day <HI>Sarah</HI> had no∣thing at all but one petticoat on; and they kept much ado and said, we would mort and go to the Devil, because the wind blew very cold.

<P>And after I had sung, the Lord com∣manded me to go to the Well in the Court, and drink Water the first thing I took: So in obedience to our tender Father and God of health and power, we went and drank much Water in the sight of the Pri∣soners; we were very dry, and they cried out in their language, saying, <HI>We would kill our selves, and go to the Devil. S.</HI> washed her head in cold water, and we never had so much as the snuff in our noses. After that they did admire and said, <HI>It was the Lord that did command us and preserve us; if they should have done so, they should have died.</HI> So the Lord was glorified, and we were comforted. And many a time were we made a dreadful sign and wonder to them, that it can never be forgotten; Praises, praises to our God who wrought it in our hearts.</P>

<HEAD>For the hands of our right worthily beloved Friends.</HEAD>
<P>RIght dear and precious Friends in the Eternal Truth and Covenant of Life and Immortality, yea Right Honourable indeed, who are strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Peace, Love and Salvation, with whom my soul is re∣freshed, nourished and cherished day by day; and my spirit is supported, and my heart is comforted with the well-springs of Eternal Life, that stream from the Foun∣tain and Rock of Salvation, for which my soul doth truly magnifie the God of Life, that giveth Life, with you my Eternal Friends according to my measure, in which I dearly salute and imbrace you in the heavenly unity of divine vertue; Praises, praises to our pure, holy, and wise God and Father of the Eternal Fulness of all Blessedness, who doth give me of the same richly to enjoy, so that I do mount up with wings as an Eagle, and do run and am not weary, and walk and am not faint, because I do see of the travel of my soul and am

<P>O precious and wel-beloved Brethren, Fathers and Elders, the Pillars of God's spiritual Building, whom my so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l right dearly loveth; yea verily, the Lord our God hath not raised, renowned, honoured nor exalted you higher in the heart, mind, spirit and soul, in any one member in all his whole Body, than he hath in me ac∣cording to my measure; the God of my Life and sweet Salvation doth know that you have been and are in my thoughts of right dear remembrance, so that my life hath not, neither doth it seem dear to me to save you harmless ever since I first saw your faces. God Almighty bless and pre∣serve you out of the hands of unreasonable men, and encrease and multiply his whole Church and People in strength, life and power, and add unto you daily such as shall be saved, and number in his <HI>Isra∣elites</HI> indeed, in whose mouths there is no guile, out of every Kindred, Tongue and

And the Lord keep you all in the Power, Dominion and Authority over the Heathen, and all the dark Powers that do corrupt the Earth for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Oh dear and worthy Friends, I can do no less than put you in remembrance of our gracious Deliverance out of the <HI>Inqui∣sition,</HI> in our eternal Father's own time and way, and according to his own will; none wrought it but himself, that he alone may have the Glory, Honour and Renown of his own mighty Work, in the hearts of you and all the faithful-hearted, and from Sea to Sea, and from Island to Island; yea verily the Voice is gone forth to the ends of the Earth, to the praise, honour and glory of the strength of our powerful Lord God; and here is our joy, and here is our Glory, and here is our Crown, that our pure, holy, perfect and wise God is mag∣nified. And is not our Joy, your Joy, and our Crown your Crown? yea really, I know it cannot be otherwise; For if one of the members of the body do faint or fail, or break or start aside, it causeth a breach or defect in the whole body: So
<PB N="236" REF="120"/> likewise, if one member do prosper in his measure, be it never so small, I know the whole body is strengthened, refreshed and comforted; and we know you all delight in us, and rejoyce over us, even as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ride; I do behold it in the Light of Righteous∣ness, and receive the benefit of it in the bright shining Countenance of our ever∣lasting Father's Love: and our souls do magnifie the Lord of Life and Glory, and our spirits do sing for joy, that ever we were found worthy of so high and honour∣able a Calling, to bear the Name of our pure, perfect Redeemer before the High and Mighty of the Earth, and to suffer so long time under them, for our pure living Testimony of the pure holy Life of Inno∣cency; Oh! praises, praises to our God everlastingly world without end, <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>In a short time after our gracious De∣liverance out of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> the Lord committed great Judgement to me to pronounce against the City, saying, That I must prophesie yet once more in his Name, and give it out in writing. The Cross seemed very heavy, but I did not
<PB N="237" REF="120" MS="y"/> dare to look at it, but was obedient to the heavenly Voice, and writ the Prophecy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P><HI>O</HI> All ye Heads and Rulers, Princes and Governours of <HI>Malta,</HI> hearken to the Voice of the Lord. The <HI>25<SUP>th</SUP></HI> day of the sixth month, called <HI>August,</HI> the year <HI>1662.</HI> near the tenth hour of the day, the Word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Thou must pro∣phesie yet once more in my Name to the Heads and Rulers, Princes and Governours of <HI>Mal∣ta,</HI> the aforesaid City, and prophesie saying, Thus saith the Lord God of power, who made Heaven and Earth, the Seas and all things that are therein, and is the Preserver of all mankind, especially of them that do believe in his Name, My wrath is kindled against you, and my Judgment is set up amongst you, be∣cause of your hard-heartedness and unbelief. I the Lord God, who desire the death of no man, but that all should return unto me and live, in tenderness and love to your souls, I cast in my Servants yet amongst you, contrary to their wills, and out of their own knowledge, to go and forewarn you of the evil that I was bringing upon you, with line upon line, and precept upon precept, of my undenyable Testi∣monies, and unfailable Truths of the glorious and powerful Appearing of my blessed Son the
<PB N="238" REF="121" MS="y"/> Lord Jesus Christ the Light of the World, in thousands of my Saints and People, in this the great and mighty Day of my Power, for the destruction of Sin and Satan, and all the works of darkness, all manner of iniquity and un∣cleanness in this Nation, and in all Nations and Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries throughout the whole Earth; for all the Wicked shall be brought to Judge∣ment, that that which is pure may arise to rule in the hearts of people; and I will over∣turn, overturn in all places, till I have re∣stored Judges as at the first, and Counsellours as at the beginning, men of perfect hearts and upright spirits, fearing my Name, doing the works of Equity and Justice to every one with∣out respect of persons, like unto faithful <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> and righteous <HI>Samuel;</HI> and will establish my beloved Son upon his Throne, and he shall rule in his Princely Power, and reign in his Kingly Majesty, whose right it is over all, and his own Spiritual Government shall be set up in all places, Righteous Rulership and pure Worship in Spirit and in Truth; and there is nothing that can prevent the Lord, who saith, If ye will not hear my Servant which speake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h my Word, whom you have proved almost these four years, whose life hath been harmless and spotless in pure Innocency amongst you; then will I bring Wo upon Wo, and Judgment upon
<PB N="239" REF="121"/> Judgment upon you, till the living shall not be able to bury the dead; my mouth hath spoken it, and my zeal will perform it: and every man's hands shall be upon his loins for pain; for the day of Recompence is come. But if you will hear my Servant which speaketh unto you in my Name, and return in your minds to the Light in your Consciences, which con∣vinceth of all sin, and wait upon me in pure silence, holy fear, dread and awe; and deny all evil thoughts, words and actions: then will I pour out of my Spirit upon you, and will make my wayes known unto you, and will soon cure you of your diseases, and heal you of your pain.</P>
<P>This have I written in obedience to the God of all Power, whom I truly serve in spirit and in truth, according to my mea∣sure. O dear and noble Prince and Peo∣ple, receive it from the Lord, and not from me, and prove the Prophecy in the Spirit of meekness, as you are wise and sober-minded men, without rashness or hastiness, in the fear of the Lord God that gave you life; and see whether I have prophesied in mine own name, or in the Name of the Lord; if in mine own name, the things I have prophesied of will not come to pass; but if in the Name of the
<PB N="240" REF="122" MS="y"/> Lord, then they will come to pass daily one after another.</P>
<P>This have we prophesied ever since the time you call <HI>Christ's Resurrection,</HI> as we have been moved of the Spirit of the Lord, and delivered it to the <HI>Consul</HI> to take it to the <HI>Grand Master,</HI> with the rest of the Heads and Governors. The <HI>Consul</HI> threa∣tened me with the Prison again. The Lord said, <HI>Fear not, I am thy God.</HI> And in a few dayes after the Lord uttered his Voice, and manifested his mighty Po∣wer in great Thunder and Lightning, so that it set on fire one of their Powder-houses, being near a mile out of the City. It was in the eighth month, the eighth day of the month, in the night, according to their account; and the wind of the Pow∣der blew down another Powder-house, a quarter of a mile from it, but the Powder was preserved; and it did great execution in the City, as they say, it blowed down five Houses, and broke most of the Glass Windows of both Palaces, and all the Merchants Windows in the City; and the Magazine where the Merchants Goods were, the Doors were blown out of the hooks, and the Walls shaken and torn, and the whole City was terribly shaken,
<PB N="241" REF="122" MS="y"/> and the doors of the houses drew up, so that great fear fell upon them all; and we heard a great shreem in the City, it was at mid∣night, and they rung out their Bells; and there was a great Glass Window in the Chamber where we lay, over right our Beds-feet, it was very thick Glass, and much of it was broken to pieces, and beat in on each side of our bed, but the Lord did not suffer any harm to us, the glory is his own. The House was so shaken, that we did exceedingly fear and quake, but it was taken from us in a moment of time, and we gave up unto the Lord to live or to die, and we had great joy and peace in the Lord. And when it was day the <HI>Con∣sul</HI> came to us, and asked of us whether we were not dead, because we were still and quiet; and while he was speaking, there came in one after another declaring what was done in the City; and he told us how all his Chamber doors were drew o∣pen, and what great fear he was in, and all the States in the City; he said the Ships in the Harbour had some harm too. There was never the like known in that place they said. We answered them, saying, <HI>One Wo is past, and behold another Wo cometh quickly, if you do not repent:</HI> yet they re∣pented
<PB N="242" REF="123"/> not of their blasphemy, rebellion, hard-heartedness, nor unbelief, but they ran up and down to their fathers the Sor∣cerers, Inchanters and Wisards, and they soon piec'd them up again. There were many of the Friars did dwell near the <HI>Con∣sul</HI>'s, and we did see their running to and fro; and in few dayes after <HI>Sarah</HI> was cal∣led to fasting, and to baldness, and to strew ashes upon her head, and to sit upon the ground with her upper parts naked for some time, and the Power of the Lord did work mightily in it, and they were amazed at it from the greatest to the least; and the Lord opened her mouth, and she spake to the <HI>Consul</HI> to tell the <HI>Grand Master</HI> to pro∣claim a Fast, and to meet together to wait upon the Lord, with their minds turned to the Light; for the Lord called for Repen∣tance, and for fasting and baldness, and girding on of sackcloth, that so he might turn away his righteous Judgments from them; for the hour of his Judgments was come, wherein the Painted Harlot should be stripped naked, and a Cup of trembling should be given her from the hand of the Lord; and many did die of a violent Fea∣ver; and we were much exercised in fast∣ing: and the <HI>Consul</HI> went forth with the
<PB N="243" REF="123"/> news amongst the Magistrates, and they talked with the Friars, and they told them we had a good intent; and in a short time after the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> sent a <HI>Dutch</HI> Friar and one of the other; the Lord had prepared us for their coming; and when they came the <HI>Consul</HI> called us before them, and so he talked a little while with us, and he said, <HI>we had a good intent, but the Devil had de∣ceived us.</HI> We asked him, whether the Devil could give power over sin, yea or nay? He said, <HI>the Devil could transform himself into an Angel of Light.</HI> We an∣swered him, we did know he could, but he could not hide himself from the Chil∣dren of Light: but they that were in the dark could not discern him. He was not able to hear us, nor to stay in the room, but the <HI>Consul</HI> did stand up against us, and accused us to him falsly before our faces, as we made it to appear to him, and so they departed; and the <HI>Consul</HI> wrought desperately against us to get us into bon∣dage again, but our God was with us: and seeing he could not prevail against us, to get us into Prison again, then he and his Confederates combined together how to cheat us of our Money. I do believe they received the Books before we came
<PB N="244" REF="124"/> out of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> for we received dear <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Letter from <HI>Legorn</HI> that did men∣tion them: We felt his workings day and night, he came subtilly to us, and told us he had wrought to set us at liberty, and the <HI>Quisitor</HI> and <HI>Grand Master</HI> bid him send us away by the next convenient passage; But now the Devil had sent Books out of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and he said he knew not what to do with them, the Magistrates would not let us go; if they should know of them, they would say we would send more when we came to <HI>England;</HI> and he asked us whe∣the we would receive them? We asked him, whether they were directed to us? he said, <HI>No.</HI> We bid him deliver them where they were directed, whatsoever we did suffer for it. He kept much ado and said, <HI>If we would give a grandy Priest ten or twelve Scoothes,</HI> (which is near fifty shil∣lings) <HI>they would conceal them.</HI> We an∣swered, Nay, it was of the Lord, in love to their souls, he should deliver them up, and make good use of them that their souls might live. He raged at us, but said no more of that to us.</P>
<P>In a little while after there came a <HI>Hol∣land</HI> Ship, which was bound for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and the <HI>Consul</HI> sent to us to come &amp; speak
<PB N="245" REF="124"/> with him, it was in the evening, I was going to bed; I felt a filthy thing, and had no freedom to go to him, but <HI>Sarah</HI> went; yet he came to me and told me, <HI>There was a Holland Ship bound for</HI> Smyrna, <HI>if we would promise him to stay there till he came back, he would call for us.</HI> We told the <HI>Consul,</HI> we stood in the Will of God, and we could not promise any thing, unless we knew the mind of God in it. He was very angry, and said <HI>we would dwell at Malta.</HI> Now we told him, we did believe the Lord had appointed a Vessel to carry us, whether it was that yea or nay, we knew not; we did not know whether that might come back in half a year; and however we did not mean to hire a Ship on purpose to fetch us. We said he might send us in a Barque to <HI>Mescena,</HI> and there we might imbarque for <HI>Legorn.</HI> He said, <HI>No; the In∣quisitor said if we should go thither, we would preach God to the Roman Catholicks, and he did not love that; and there was an</HI> Inquisi∣tion <HI>that did belong to the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>and though the Pope had set us free, yet he would take us Prisoners again.</HI> We told him we would adventure that; but he had an end of his own in it: he had much Annise to send to <HI>Legorn,</HI> and he would have had us
<PB N="246" REF="125"/> to engage the <HI>Flemen</HI> to call for us to carry that too, that we might have paid part for the carriage of it; but our God had ap∣pointed a greater work for us to do which we knew not of.</P>
<P>In a little time after we were freed from the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> he told us <HI>Daniel</HI> took up an hundred Dollers, and he would have us send to <HI>Mescena</HI> for an hundred more. We told him, we had received no such order, and withal asked him what we should do with so much money, seeing we had mo∣ney in his hands? and said, we would not send for money to keep us in bonds; and minded him of his Promise to dear <HI>Da∣niel Baker.</HI> He said <HI>Daniel</HI> could not re∣deem us out of Prison, but he had stood Cap in hand to the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> for us. That was true, if he had continued faithful, great would have been his reward, but he sought himself in it; and when his ex∣pected end was not answered, then he and his wife and servants were very bitter against us for Righteousness sake, in-so-much that we stood in great hazard of our lives; many a time we did feel their slay∣ing Instruments drawn, so that we had even the sentence of death in our selves, but the Lord prevented them, and pre∣served
<PB N="247" REF="125"/> us, and great was our travel of soul night and day; the glory is the Lord's, whose mighty Power did the work: ever∣lasting praises, honour and dominion over all to our pure, holy and perfect Lord God, world without end, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the satisfaction of all Friends concerning our deliverance out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>In∣quisition,</HI> this is a true and brief Relation. Three quarters of a year before <HI>Daniel Ba∣ker</HI> came to <HI>Malta,</HI> the <HI>Consul</HI> for the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> came to us, and said, <HI>the Inquisitor sent him to know if we would be Catholicks yea or nay?</HI> We answered, we were true Chri∣stians. He said, <HI>if we would be Catholicks, we might dwell at</HI> Melita, <HI>or go to</HI> England. We said we were the Servants of the true and living God. One of the Magistrates said, <HI>we were not Christians, neither had we the Cross of Christ.</HI> We answered, we were <HI>Christians,</HI> and had received the Spirit of Christ which made a Christian, and he that had not the Spirit of Christ was no Chri∣stian, and we had the Cross of Christ; without the Cross there was no Salvation: the Cross of Christ is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that belie∣veth.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="126"/>
<P>He said, <HI>If we would not be Catholicks, we must suffer long Imprisonment by the Popes Order.</HI> That was not true, I had an An∣swer in my Conscience against it. And in a little time after they told us, <HI>if we would kiss the Cross we should be freed out of Pri∣son, and go to the Consul's till a convenient passage did present to carry us for</HI> England; for the Pope had sent word they should take it into their consideration, and set us free for <HI>England,</HI> without doing any violencce, as we heard, and we did believe it, be∣cause we had a more sure word of Prophe∣cy than did use to proceed out of their mouthes: we told them we could not kiss the Cross to get our liberty, neither did we desire our freedom on any such terms; but we looked every day when they would call us forth to kiss the Cross, and we did pray and cry mightily to our Eternal Fa∣ther to prevent them in it, and to preserve us out of it; for the Tempter was very strong within and without, so that I took little rest for many dayes and nights, see∣ing the great danger it would plunge us into; for I saw the painted walls, and the Crosses set before me, but the gracious God of power, who did appear in our Af∣flictions, and revealed his Will to me in a
<PB N="249" REF="126"/> Night-Vision, saying, <HI>Touch not, taste not, handle not, but wait diligently up∣on me: you have two things yet to work over before you can be set at liberty.</HI> We knew the Cross was one, but we knew not what the other was.</P>
<P>The next time the <HI>Consul</HI> came, he told us that the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> said, <HI>If any one would engage for three or four thousand Dollers to be paid if ever we came thither again, we should be set at liberty,</HI> but he said no more of the Cross; but the Obligation was the second thing that we were to work over, but I could never see, nor dare desire any man to be engaged for us, because I do know all Decrees, Laws, Tyes, Bonds and Chains, and Precepts of men must be bro∣ken through the righteous Decree of our mighty Lord God, and upon the same con∣sideration we were made willing to wait, till the Lord should break this Chain also, that no other dear Friend or Lamb of God might suffer for the same thing; no, God forbid.</P>
<P>Then it pleased the Lord to send <HI>Daniel Baker,</HI> who in obedience to the God of Heaven did offer up body for body, yea life &amp; all for our liberty, but could not be heard; but the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> said, <HI>If any would
<PB N="250" REF="127"/> engage for the payment of three or four thou∣sand Dollers, to be paid if ever we came there again, we should have our liberty; but other∣wise we must die in the Prison, for that was the Pope's Law:</HI> but we knew it was left to his consideration, so we told them we could not engage, nor desire any to en∣gage for us, because it was out of the Co∣venant of God; and our <HI>yea was yea,</HI> and our <HI>nay was nay,</HI> and we did not believe that ever it was the mind of God that we should return thither again. So <HI>Daniel</HI> departed in the Love of God, and they sent to <HI>England</HI> to Friends, and to other Islands to the English Merchants, for some to engage for us, that we might have our liberty, but the Merchants sent word they were not willing to answer their unrea∣sonable demands, for the payment of so many thousand Dollers, if in case we re∣turned thither again. There were many that did seek for our liberty, that were not of us, because they knew our cruel and strait bondage and terrible afflictions, and were willing to engage what was reason; but because our just and wise God would make his Power known for his own ho∣nour, he would not suffer any thing to prevail for our Deliverance, insomuch as
<PB N="251" REF="127"/> we could understand, but what he wrought by his invisible Power in the hearts of our Enemies. It was given into my heart half a year after <HI>Daniel</HI> came thence, that if I could speak with the <HI>Inquisitor,</HI> he would grant us our liberty; and in a little time he came to the Inquisition-Court-Cham∣ber, and we heard of it, and desired to speak with him, which he granted us, and we told him we had wronged none, we had defrauded none, neither was guile found in our mouthes; but we had suffered inno∣cently almost four years, for Conscience-sake, and we knew they had no peace in our sufferings. So the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> was very courteous to us, and promised our liberty in a few dayes, and he said he would send for the <HI>Consul,</HI> and get him to engage for five hundred Dollers to be paid for us, if ever we came again; in case the <HI>Consul</HI> did deny it, he would send to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope for an Order to set us at liberty with∣out an Obligation. So we were contented to wait the Lord's time; who had often promised us, <HI>That we should have our liberty in a day when we thought not of, and at an hour when we were not aware;</HI> and good was the Word of the Lord, and faithful in all his Promises.</P>
<PB N="252" REF="128"/>
<P>About two weeks after the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> came to the <HI>Inquisition</HI> with his Lieute∣nant and other of the Magistrates, and a <HI>Consul</HI> for the <HI>English,</HI> and he sent the Proctor of the Court to call us forth before them; and when we came he told us, <HI>the Consul would engage for the payment of five hundred Dollers, if ever we returned thither again.</HI> We not knowing at present whe∣ther it was the mind of our heavenly Fa∣ther that the Earth should help the Wo∣man yea or nay, yet waiting in the Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of God, it was brought to my remembrance that the Lord had said <HI>we had two things to work over, before we could be set at liberty.</HI> So they used many words, but we eying the Lord, yet answered them in the Spirit of meekness. They called for half a sheet of paper, and the <HI>Chancellour</HI> asked what he should write? but the Lord stood up for his own glory, so that they had not power to write one Letter. The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> said, <HI>they would talk of it another time;</HI> and they did ask us, <HI>whether we would not return back again to our Husbands and Children, if it were the will of God?</HI> We answered, It was our intent in the will of God so to do. The <HI>Lord Inquisitor</HI> took his leave very courteously of us, and desired our prospe∣rous
<PB N="253" REF="128"/> return into our Country; and like∣wise the Magistrates, with the inferiour Officers, not requiring penny or penny-worths for any Fees or Attendance that we had among them in that time; but as we saw our freedom in the Lord, we gave the Keeper and some poor men something for Conscience sake.</P>
<P>So we departed in peace, according to the compleat example of the holy men of God, kneeling down and desiring our hea∣venly Father never to lay to their charge what they did unto us, because they knew us not; so this Scripture was fulfilled, <HI>that he made our enemies our footstool, and they that hate us without a cause to be at peace with us.</HI> So we were delivered in Power and great glory out of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> into the <HI>Consul</HI>'s hand to be sent for <HI>England,</HI> as opportunity did present. The <HI>Consul</HI> said that he did engage for us after we were out of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> but we could never find that it was true.</P>
<P>So we were kept eleven weeks at the <HI>Consul's</HI> house, before they could have a passage to carry us out of their Coast; and the Cross was so heavy, and the travel of souls so great, that, as to the visible, all hopes were past that I could live in the bo∣dy;
<PB N="254" REF="129"/> but all things are possible with God, who by his mighty Power hath removed Mountains, and subdued the Earth, and broke through the double-doors, locks and bolts, and Iron bars, and all the chains of wickedness, &amp; every unrighteous Decree; and by his high &amp; mighty Hand and strong outstretched Arm hath returned our Cap∣tivity, that <HI>Jacob</HI> may rejoyce and <HI>Israel</HI> may be glad, magnified be the Name of our Eternal Father for ever; yea, Honour and Glory, Power and Dominion over all to him who ruleth on high, world without end, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And when we had been at the <HI>Consul</HI>'s house eleven weeks, there came one of the King's Frigats, called the <HI>Saphire,</HI> the Captain's name was <HI>Samuel Titswel.</HI> The <HI>Grand-Master</HI> sent to the Captain of the <HI>Saphire</HI> to entreat him to stay the Ship all night, to take up almost forty Passengers. The Captain made himself unwilling, be∣cause he had no product, but lay out in the Road a league from the City. The <HI>Grand-Master</HI> writ to him, he knew his brother at <HI>England</HI> would not deny him such a cour∣tesie to take in twenty four Knights, Ca∣valliers, and their servants, and two <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> and so he staid till the next day, it
<PB N="255" REF="129"/> was for his great advantage. Upon pain of death the Cavaliers must not see us heretofore, but our heavenly Father doth know how to bring his own purposes to pass, and none can hinder him.</P>
<P>Oh! that we should be put on board with so many of them, and one was the <HI>Inquisi∣tors</HI> own brother, as he said, and was as like him as if the same man, as I told the Captain, before I knew who he was: he spake to the Captain often that we might not want any thing that was in the Ship, and he told us if we were at <HI>Malta</HI> again we should not be persecuted so; for as soon as he saw our faces he said, <HI>he would not differ with us;</HI> he and some other of them laid to the Captain, <HI>If we went to Heaven one way, and they another, yet we should all meet together at the last.</HI> But we held out Christ Jesus the Light of the World, to be the <HI>alone way</HI> to the Father: And great was our labour from day to day. But our own Country-men were much worse than most of them, so that they bid us go back to <HI>Malta</HI> again; and said the <HI>Eng∣lish would use us worse than the Maltezes.</HI></P>
<P>So when we came to <HI>Legorn,</HI> the Ship could get no product, and if we would go a-shoar there, we might go into the <HI>Laza∣retta</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="130"/> for forty dayes. And so the King's Agent desired the Captain to carry us as far as he could, till he met the General, and then he would provide a passage for us, if that Ship was commanded back a∣gain; for if he should have left us there in <HI>Lazaretta,</HI> the Agent must take order for us, he said, according to the King's Order. The Merchants shewed us no small kindness, and treated us with much love, and sent us Wine and Bread, and a great many good things for our refresh∣ment: the Sea was high so that they could not conveniently come to us, but they told the Captain they would come; and if we would have money or any thing else whatsoever we would write for, they would send it to us. We had but little money, but being we were coming for our Coun∣try, we saw but little freedom to take up money: And the Captain promised, as we should not want any money, nor any thing else till we came to <HI>England;</HI> so he should not have taken any money for our passage, because it was the King's Ship, but he received several Dollers which victu∣alled the Ship; So he hasted thence and came to <HI>Tarloone,</HI> and there he could get no product, but all the <HI>Malta</HI> Knights were
<PB N="257" REF="130" MS="y"/> set a-shoar into <HI>Lazaretta:</HI> so we came to <HI>Malago,</HI> and there the Captain had pro∣duct, but he did not dare to make any long stay there, for fear the Fleet should be be∣fore him at <HI>Tangeer.</HI> He was sent before the Fleet out of <HI>Turkie,</HI> with Letters to <HI>Malta,</HI> and to <HI>Legorn,</HI> and other places, and we had some service for the Lord in every Harbour.</P>
<P>So we came to <HI>Tangeer</HI> above two weeks before the Fleet came. The Captain said it was above an hundred pound out of his way, because he made so much haste. The Lord did hasten him for his Work's sake, as it was clearly manifested to us all along. The Captain said we must not go a-shoar till he had spoke with the Governour's Excellency.</P>
<P>So we went a-shoar as we were moved of the Lord, and great was our Work for the Seeds sake. Oh! oh! great are the Abominations of the wicked in that place; none worse than English-men for swear∣ing, lying, pride, drunkenness, whoredoms, and such like, so that our righteous souls were vexed day and night with their un∣clean conversation, and the pure Spirit of the Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was grieved, and the Seed of God was pressed, even as a Cart is pressed with
<PB N="258" REF="131"/> sheaves; So we declared boldly against them all in the Name of the Lord, and they came flocking about us, high and low, great and small, into the house where we were lodged, or where-ever we went, of all sorts. In a few days we were moved to go to the Governour, and to lay their Abominations before him, the just Judg∣ments due unto them from the Lord for their great and grievous Wickedness; and laid it upon him from the Lord to suppress it, in so much as lay in him to do, lest the just and holy Lord God Almighty did sud∣denly deliver them into the hands of their Enemies to be destroyed, after the rest of them were slain in the Wrath and Anger of the Almighty: and we told him they had not greater enemies without than they had within, and if they did repent and truly fear the Lord, their Enemies would be subdued within, and they would know when to go out against their Enemies and prosper, and the Lord would make their Enemies to be at peace with them. So the Governour said, he did lovingly re∣ceive our good Instructions and Admoni∣tions, and promised to follow our Coun∣sel; and would have given us money, and desired us to eat and drink in his house.
<PB N="259" REF="131"/> We did freely imbrace his love, without meat, drink or money.</P>
<P>And he was very courteous to us, and tender over us, so that he gave Command∣ment to all the Garison, <HI>That none should abuse us in word nor action, upon pain of se∣vere punishment.</HI> There are many <HI>Portu∣gals, Jews</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> which could as freely have burnt us, as they could have burnt wood; but our pure, holy, wise, strong and powerful Lord God, protected us in the midst of them, and took away all slavish fear from us, so that we were as bold as Lions for God's Truth, against all their Idolatry and Wickedness. The Lord is worthy to have the glory for evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And in a few dayes after it was laid upon us of the Lord, to go forth to meet the <HI>Moors</HI> their Enemies, which laid siege a∣gainst them, and they were such a bloody savage people, that it seemed a very hard thing to us, but the Lord said unto me, <HI>Go forth, fear not, they shall not harm thée, or you, Behold the Sword of the Lord and of</HI> Gideon <HI>is with you.</HI> And so we believed, and were made willing to adventure life and all in obedience. And so we went to the Governour to desire we
<PB N="260" REF="132"/> might be let out of the Gate, declaring the mind of God in it: but the Governor told us, <HI>we must expect nothing but cruel death, or bonds for ever,</HI> telling us what terrible weapons they had, and entreated us to go again to our lodging, and wait up∣on the Lord, and pray as our manner was, he said, and then if we could not have peace, we might come to him again. And in two or three dayes after he came to us, and asked us concerning the thing. We told him we were made willing to bear and to wait upon the Lord to perswade his heart to let us go, and said we did believe the Lord would preserve us in the midst of them, and deliver us from them, and we should be returned as safe as we went forth; yet however our bodies were but a reasonable sacrifice to offer for him that gave them us. So he left us at that time. After that we went to his house again, and he did seem to be somewhat willing then to let us go. Then his Se∣cretary stept to him, and desired him that he would not let us go, declaring to him that if he did let us go, that it could not possibly be expected that ever we should return into the City again, or see any of our Relations or Country, except the Lord
<PB N="261" REF="132"/> did work a wonderful Miracle by deliver∣ing us out of their hands: And then the Governour told us in pitty and tenderness towards us, he believing we were innocent harmless women, and did truly fear God, he could not let us go forth, the <HI>English</HI> would speak very hardly of him, and say he forced us forth to be destroyed by them. So in a day or two after the <HI>Moors</HI> did shew forth their Flag to parley for Peace, and came near to treat with them, and till then our souls, hearts and spirits were ex∣ercised in such strong travel and labour night and day, we could not hide it from the people of the house where we lay; but we do believe if we had gone forth among them before they came to treat with them, the Lord our God who liveth for ever, would have preserved us, and we should have been returned, to the conviction of many, and to the astonishment of all the whole Garison, for his own glory: but if we should have gone forth to them when they came to parley for Peace, then our Country-men would have said, that that was the reason we were preserved, and God would not have had the glory. The Lord said, <HI>our Sacrifice was accepted,</HI> because he knew the uprightness of our hearts.</P>
<PB N="262" REF="133"/>
<P>We went to take our leaves of the Go∣vernour, having finished our Testimonies in that place, acknowledging the love we received from him; and he proffered us whatever we wanted for the Ship, and his kindness extended so far that he would send it to the Vessel. We received his love, but took nothing of him, and so we departed the City, and went aboard the Ship that brought us thither; and that Ship was commanded back into the <HI>Straits,</HI> so that we were destitute of a passage. So <HI>Sarah</HI> being moved of the Lord, went un∣to the General and made him acquainted therewith, and he very lovingly sent us a∣board in another Ship, and bade us take care for nothing, he would give Order we should not want any thing till we came to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When we were ready to set sail, there came a mighty Scool of Fish dancing round the Ship, and leaping above water with great joy, as I am a witness of; and as I waited on the Lord, considering what it might signifie, the Lord answered me, <HI>It signified the multitudes of his Saints and Servants in</HI> England <HI>or elsewhere, that will rejoyce at the return of our Captivity, and glorifie his Name:</HI> which
<PB N="263" REF="133" MS="y"/> caused great joy and refreshment to our souls. The Lord made it manifest we should have a safe passage to <HI>England,</HI> and caused us to declare it, so that many de∣sired to return with us in that Ship on that account; yet I told them we might meet with storms and hardships by the way, and so it came to pass; and great tryals we had by reason of storms and tempestuous weather, that we were in great danger and peril, so that many were wounded and bruised with the tossing of the Vessel, and the Master of the Ship cast over-board, when the Sea was so high as Mountains; yet the Lord wrought wonderfully for his deliverance, and he was brought into the Ship safe again, and we all came safe to Land. The Captain was a very civil man, and we were very civilly used in that Ship. We were scattered from all the rest of the Ships, and could never see them again. And so the Name of the Lord be magni∣fied for ever over all, whose Name is a strong Tower to all that can trust in him.</P>
<P>It is laid upon me to manifest the large love of God to us in our greatest extre∣mity, when we knew nothing but that we should be burnt for many dayes together.

<Q REND="margQuotes">Then in a Vision of the night I saw a large Room, and a great Wood-fire in the Chimney; and I saw the eternal Son of God sitting in a Chair by the fire, in the form of a servant: And likewise I saw a very amiable well-favoured Man-Child sitting in a hollow Chair over the fire, it had no clothes on but a little fine linen about the upper parts, it did not appear to be above three quarters old; the fire did flame on every side of it, yet the Child did play and was merry: I would have took it up, for fear it should have been burnt, but he that sate in the Chair bade me let it alone. I turned me about and I saw another heavenly Angel of God's presence standing a little wayes off; it was not <HI>Gabriel:</HI> and then he that sate in the Chair, bade me take up the Child, and it had no harm.

<P>THou art a bloody Persecutor of God and his eternal Truth, and the Mes∣sengers thereof; go whither thou wilt the righteous God will follow thee and find thee out; dig never so deep, thou canst not hide thy self from the Light; Cruel∣ty, hard-heartedness, vain-glory, hypo∣crisie, lying, blasphemy, pride, unbelief, all manner of wickedness lodgeth within thee: thou in thy measure art the sinck of Hell, thy mouth uttereth perverse things; the poyson of Asps is under thy tongue, thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity; thou art for eternal burnings. Thou saidst thou madest thy self a holy man, having wit and learning, so thou becamest a Prelate or a Bishop, and studied Divinity fifteen years, and by it
<PB N="267" REF="135"/> thou camest by thy Ordination to be a Fa∣ther of Learning, a Saviour of Souls; thou saidst thou hadst received vertue to remit sins, and thou didst offer to take our blood upon thee, and to save our souls and bo∣dies, and wouldst have us to pray in the name of such a holy Father as thou who art a Catholick; and didst kneel down of∣ten, and speak many bitter wishes; <HI>that you were in the true Faith:</HI> But glory be to the Name of our God for ever, the Light did discover thee when thou camest under many false covers and colours; thy lyes and blasphemies were manifested to us by the Light, and by the Light judged and condemned, and we preserved and justi∣fied. O thou perverter of the pure way of Righteousness, thou child of the Devil, thou deceiver of souls, the Lord will re∣quire the souls of the simple at thy hands; thou hast caused them to err from the li∣ving God; thou <HI>Lucifer,</HI> thou shalt be cast down from thy seat, with all thy whore∣doms, into the bottomless pit, there to re∣main for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI> And the Lord Je∣sus Christ alone shall reign over all the powers of darkness unto the ends of the Earth, and the powers of darkness disco∣vered, defaced and utterly destroyed with

<P>Thou hast slighted the day of thy Visi∣tation; thou hast had line upon line, and precept upon precept declared to thee of the good Word of God, but thou hast made a mock, and said it was a foolish thing: thou didst want men of learning and wit; thou hast learning and tongues, Oh! dost thou not see thy folly? <HI>Hath not God chosen the foolish things to confound the wisdom of the wise, and to bring to nought the counsel of the prudent?</HI> In the Light thou art known, by the Light thou art judged and con∣demned. Thy Gospel is carnal that doth uphold thy Kingdom; Iniquity, double-doors,
<PB N="269" REF="136" MS="y"/> Chains, Bolts, Iron Whips, Racks, Halters, Quarterings, Cruelties, Blood-thirstiness; what wickedness is there that is not in your Kingdom? you will cheat and cozen one another, and will tolerate all manner of vice, and say it is pardon∣able, and will remit their sins, if they will believe in you, and pray in your name: Thou wouldst have us pray by thy spirit after thee, and say Mass and <HI>Pater noster,</HI> and pray to Saints departed, and thy <HI>Jesus</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> with Beads and Crucifixes, and cross our foreheads and chins. Oh thou Antichrist! wouldst thou have us turn from the Spirit of the living God, which is pure and holy, to pray to stocks and stones, thy dead gods, which cannot see, nor hear, nor speak. The Lord said for∣merly, and doth say now, <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image, or the likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, &amp;c.</HI> Cursed be thy Images, and thou that teachest people to fall down to worship them.

Of how much sorer pu∣nishment shall he be thought worthy, that trampleth under foot the blood of the Covenant,

The Scripture speaks of a Hell and a Heaven, in which the souls of the Righ∣teous

Thou saidst, thou couldst prove a <HI>Purgatory</HI> in <HI>Maccabees:</HI> we know no such place; but we know it speaketh of a woman that had seven sons, which because they could not forsake the Law of the living God, their tongues were cut out. Art not thou a lyer? didst not thou say, thou wast a Remitter of sins, and a saviour of souls, and yet they must dye in their sins, and go to Purgatory? Oh thou blind guide! thou art to be denied: dost not thou see thy own confusion? If any sin against God, you then give a Pardon; but if any offend you, Oh the Rackings, Hal∣terings, Strapado's, Chains, Bolts, Irons! your cruelty doth exceed what we do te∣stifie; you have sold your selves to work wicked Abominations: you wear defiled garments to deceive the simple-hearted, and say there is virtue in them, and think it an honour for them to kiss your defiled garments. The Spirit speaketh expresly, that <HI>in the latter days there should be seducing spirits, teaching lyes in hypocrisie, the Doctrine of the Devil; to abstain from marriage, and meats which God hath created for the preser∣vation
<PB N="272" REF="138"/> of the Creation:</HI> but if a man com∣mit Adultery with a woman, and come and confess to you, you will pardon him: Oh horrible Blasphemy! there is none can forgive sins but God only: <HI>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;</HI> and <HI>he is the Propitia∣tion for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.</HI> When <HI>Nathan</HI> came to <HI>David</HI> to tell him of his sins, the faithful Witness in his own Conscience which did convince him he was a sinner, made him cry out, <HI>I am the man that hath sinned against the Lord. Nathan</HI> was a true Prophet of the Lord, to convince of sin, but not pardon sin. If <HI>Noah, Daniel</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> were in that City, they should save but their own souls alive for their own righte∣ousness. Oh! how do you dare to pervert the holy Scriptures, which by so many infallible Testimonies were given forth by the Spirit of the living God? <HI>For the Scriptures are of no private interpretation, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost; and they are profitable for Doctrine, Uses, and Reproofs,</HI> that all whose minds are turned to the measure of the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation that hath appeared in all, to teach and lead out
<PB N="273" REF="138"/> of sin, and to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live righteously and godly in this present evil world, they come to have the Scriptures fulfilled in them, as they were in them which gave them forth, for they lived in the life of the Scriptures; their lives, and what they did declare, was <HI>Yea and Amen;</HI> and they were guided by <HI>one Spirit,</HI> and they spake <HI>one and the same thing</HI> as the Light did lead them: for the Light is a perfect guide into all truth, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart of every one, and is a dis∣cerner of spirits; it shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not. The Light will discover every deed of dark∣ness; it is the faithful and true Witness of God, which he hath given to every one a measure to profit, to convince, to reprove, to instruct, to condemn, to justifie. And those that receive the Light in the love thereof, to them he doth reveal his ever∣lasting loving-kindness, and make known the Mysteries of his Truth and Counsel. <HI>The willing and obedient shall eat the good of the Land, but those that refuse and rebel, the Sword of the Lord shall devour.

<P>Every one that loveth the Light, will bring their deeds to the Light, that they may be approved of the Light that they are wrought in God; for to the Light of Christ all must come; and whatsoever hath been done in secret shal be made manifest; when the Book of every ones Conscience shall be laid open, then shall every ones heart be made manifest by the Light, and shall receive every one according to their deeds done in the body: <HI>they that sow to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but they that sow to the Spirit, shall reap life everlast∣ing: For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Christ Jesus our Lord; who is the Light of the World, that lighteth every one that cometh into the World, that all men through him might be∣lieve.

<PB N="276" REF="140"/> that you may be the Children of your heavenly Father.</HI> Christ died for his Enemies, <HI>He was made sin for us, that knew no sin, that we might become the Righteousness of God in him.</HI> What greater Love can there be?

And in about two weeks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime after, I left the rest of Friends, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbarqued in a <HI>French</HI> Ship, bound for St. <HI>John de Acra,</HI> formerly called <HI>Ptolomais,</HI> and after a few dayes sail, we passed by the Island of <HI>Malta</HI> (where <HI>Paul</HI> suffered shipwrack) where we made little stay, but hoisted sail, and in about two or three weeks time we came to the ruinated City <HI>Tirus,</HI> having met with a contrary wind, we were stayed three or four dayes; the Inhabitants, being <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> were moderate towards me; and from thence in about one day we came to <HI>Ptolomais,</HI> or St. <HI>John de Acra,</HI> where I remained about eight dayes (being much opposed by the Friars) in a <HI>French</HI> Merchants house, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen imbarqued in a Vessel (amongst <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI>) bound for <HI>Joppa,</HI> but the Wind rising against us, we came to an Anchor at <HI>Tourtons;</HI> and on the next mor∣ning divers <HI>Turks</HI> came aboard, and de∣manded
<PB N="280" REF="142"/> Tribute of those called <HI>Christians</HI> in the Vessel, which they paid for fear of sufferings, but very unwillingly, their de∣mands being very unreasonable; and in like manner demanded of me, but I re∣fusing to pay according to their demands, they threatned to beat the soals of my feet with a stick, and one of them would have put his hand into my pocket, but the chiefest of them rebuked him: Soon after they began to take me out of the Vessel to effect their work; but one of the <HI>Turks</HI> belonging to the Vessel, speaking to them as they were taking me ashore, they let me alone; wherein I saw the good hand of God preserving me, and also there be∣ing an <HI>Armenian</HI> present, and seeing I ra∣ther chose to suffer, than to grant them their unreasonable demands, he cryed out, <HI>I was a good Christian, I was a good Christian,</HI> and became very loving unto me whilst he remained with me. After this, about three or four dayes we came to <HI>Joppa,</HI> and from thence the same day we came to <HI>Ramlah</HI> (or <HI>Ramoth</HI> in <HI>Gilead</HI>) which (as it did appear) the Friars at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> hear∣ing of my coming, gave order unto some there, to stay me, which accordingly was done; for I was taken and carried into a
<PB N="281" REF="142"/> house, and locked up into a room for one night and a part of the day following, and then had liberty to go into the yard, but as a Prisoner, in which time the <HI>Turks</HI> shew∣ed friendship unto me, one Antient man especially of great reputation, who desired that I might come unto his house; which thing being granted, he courteously enter∣tained me. And further, it came to pass about four or five dayes after my confinement, there came an <HI>Irish</HI> Friar, with a Guard accompanying him from <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> unto me (it being twenty miles distant) and discoursed with me concern∣ing the things of God's Kingdom. At first he seemed in words as though he would have shewed friendship unto me; but the poyson of Asps was under his tongue: for when he could not prevail over me, nor others with him in way of discourse, about the things of God, he then said that was not the business he was sent about; but he had divers things to propound unto me, from his brethren the Friars at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> as followeth) which he would do.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Whether I would promise when I come to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>that I would visit the Holy Places</HI> (as he called them) <HI>as other Pil∣grims did.</HI></ITEM>
<PB N="282" REF="143"/>
<ITEM>2. <HI>And give such sums of money, as is the usual manner of Pilgrims.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Wear such a sort of habit as is the man∣ner of Pilgrims.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Speak nothing against the Turks Laws.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>And when I came to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>not to speak any thing about Religion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And thus they strove to make their hold strong, to keep me from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but all was in vain: for I not conforming unto them, but standing in the Will of the Lord, to do as he might order me; they then the next morning took me and set me upon a horse, and with a Guard both of Horsemen and Footmen, with the afore∣said <HI>Irish</HI> Friar, I was brought from thence back to <HI>Joppa,</HI> and was imbarqued the same day in a Vessel (with one Popish Father as a Guard) bound for St. <HI>John de Acra</HI> (or <HI>Ptolomais</HI>) but in our Voyage a very strong Wind arose upon us, wherby the Vessel was near to sink; and then the Popish Father in a distressed condition cryed out, and beat his face with his hands, and would have me to pray for them; the poor Sea∣men threw their Goods over into the Sea, to lighten the Vessel, and they lost their Helm; great was their dammage, yet through the mercy of the Lord our lives
<PB N="283" REF="143"/> were preserved, and came safe to the place whither we were bound: yet great was the enmity that arose in the Friars in that place, whereby their children would hard∣ly receive me, though I was willing to give to the utmost for what necessaries I had occasion for, which I had done before (as they also knew) yet by reason of the Fryars and Jesuites enmity at the present, many of their party feared to receive me, neither did I know a place outwardly where to lay my head with safety; nay, not so much as upon a stone, unless the Lord did wonderfully preserve me, which in my heart I did believe he would do; whereby I remained content in my spirit, without any murmuring, and began to walk out of the City (it raining) to lie down in the field (for what I knew) but there came a <HI>French</HI> Merchant, called <HI>Sur-Rubie,</HI> whom the Lord (after my exercise) had prepared to receive me, a man that I had never seen before (that I knew of) who friendly took me unto his house as I was passing along, where I remained above twenty dayes, and he would often speak unto me, saying, <HI>Surely it was the Lord's doing</HI> (his receiving of me) <HI>for,</HI> said he, <HI>my own Country-men, when they come to me,
<PB N="284" REF="144"/> they are little to me, but thee I can willingly receive.</HI> The old man would admire the Lord's doing in this thing, and did believe I was sent of the Lord, and he did love me exceeding much: but the Friars had so far prevailed with the <HI>Consul,</HI> that in 20. dayes time I could not be received into a Vessel for to go towards <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> so that I knew not but to have gone by Land; yet it was several dayes Journey, and I knew not the way, no not so much as out of the City, besides the much difficulty there is in going through the Country, be∣yond my expression; yet I not looking at the hardships, but at the heavenly Will of our Lord, I was made to cry in my heart, <HI>Lord, thy Will be done, and not mine;</HI> and so being preparing to go, and taking leave of the tender old man, he cryed, <HI>I should be destroyed if I went by Land,</HI> and would not let me go; but the next morning he went unto the <HI>Consul,</HI> and spake unto him ear∣nestly, that I might have liberty to go by Sea to <HI>Joppa,</HI> (for before the <HI>Consul</HI> had given order to the contrary) the Friars also did speak to the <HI>Consul</HI> very much to hinder me, being I could not conform to joyn with them, and said <HI>I would turn Turk, and be a Devil;</HI> yet the friendly
<PB N="285" REF="144"/> old man appeared, and in my behalf op∣posed them, and through the Lord's great goodness liberty was obtained for my re∣turn back to <HI>Joppa</HI> by Sea, contrary to the wills of the Friars, who thought to have sent me back again out of those parts; for within about three or four dayes, a Vessel being bound for <HI>Joppa</HI> I entred therein, and in about a dayes time arrived there, where some Friars also (who went along in the same Vessel) sought to hinder me from going to <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> but I going ashoar before them, payed for my passage, and so went on my Journey alone; where having met with many people in the way peace∣ably passed by me, untill I came about six miles, and then I met with three men, two of them riding upon Asses, and the other going on foot; they asked me for money, one of them holding his Gun to my breast, and another of them put his hand into my pockets &amp; took some things out, I not resisting them, but stood in the fear of the Lord, who preserved me, for they passed away; and he that took my things forth of my pockets, put them up a∣gain, taking nothing from me, nor did me the least harm, but one of them took me by the hand and led me a little on my way
<PB N="286" REF="145"/> in a friendly manner, and so left me. So I passing through the like dangers (through the great love of God, which caused me to glorifie his blessed Name) I came (though in much weakness of body) unto <HI>Ramlah,</HI> or <HI>Ramoth Gilead,</HI> and going through the Town I was known (having been there before) two men of the said Town, Ad∣herents to the Friars (which before had opposed me) arose and laid hold on me, and hurried me in a violent manner to∣wards the place in the Town, in which be∣fore I had been kept prisoner; but as they were abusing me, there came two <HI>Turks</HI> and threw them violently from me, and took me from them, one leading me by one arm, the other by the other arm, and in that manner brought me to one of their Houses of Worship or <HI>Mosco;</HI> and I being entered thereinto, many people gathered together therein, also the Priests of <HI>Ma∣homet,</HI> before whom I was called and caused to sit down; And then it was de∣manded of me, <HI>Whether I would turn unto the Turks Religion?</HI> I answered, I could not turn unto them: but they pressed me very much, and said they would give me great things, and I should not need fear what the <HI>Christians</HI> could do unto me.
<PB N="287" REF="145"/> Nevertheless I answered, I could not turn unto them for all the World: yet mighti∣ly did many strive with me with an ardent affection, and would have had me hold up one finger, as a sign of owning them: and one bid me say, <HI>Christ is bad;</HI> I answer∣ed, I knew him to be good, and I was his Servant. Then some of the chief of them were displeased very much, and said, <HI>If I would not turn to their Religion, I should die.</HI> I answered, I should rather die than turn unto them. It was answered, <HI>I should then die.</HI> So they gave order to the Executi∣oner (for, as I understand, they execute presently after Sentence) who haled me away to the place where it was expected I should have been burnt to death with Camels dung, and so sate me down upon the ground, where the Lord preserved me over the fear of men, though I was as a Sheep prepared for the slaughter. And thus it came to pass, whilst some appeared very violent, the Lord raised up some others amongst them whom he made in∣strumental in his hand for the preserva∣tion of my life. And there came an anti∣ent tender man, a <HI>Turk,</HI> and of great re∣putation, unto me, and said, <HI>Whether I would turn from my Religion or not, I should
<PB N="288" REF="146"/> not die.</HI> Then they brought me before them again, who asked me, <HI>Will you turn?</HI> I an∣swered, Nay. They then recorded it in a Book, that I was no <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> but of another Religion; for I had denied the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> unto them, yet owned I was a <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P>After this they were much broken down in their spirits, as men whose strength fai∣led, and then the aforesaid Antient man took me, and ordered his servants to con∣duct me to his house, where he friendly entertained me; but within about four or five dayes time there came a Guard of Horsemen, which I understood the Friars had hired to bring me before the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Gaza;</HI> for, as it was told me, the Friars in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had pre-informed the said <HI>Bashaw</HI> against me (whom they looked up∣on to be their chiefest friend in all these parts) who desired me to be brought be∣fore him, and swore he would kill me in his own person; and with the aforesaid Guard of armed men I was brought in two dayes unto <HI>Gaza</HI> (where <HI>Sampson</HI> formerly dwelt) where I remained about five days; in which time it was said I should go be∣fore the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> but it came not so to pass, for he being informed by some <HI>Turks</HI> of the
<PB N="289" REF="146"/> wicked proceedings of the Friars towards me, whereupon he gave order that the Friars should pay an hundred Dollers un∣to those men which had informed him of their bad dealings towards me: and fur∣ther, those men which brought me to <HI>Ga∣za,</HI> he ordered they should convey me back, and from thence the Friars should cause me to be brought to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who were the great opposers of my coming thi∣ther. In this said City I was in a friendly manner both visited and received by many both <HI>Turks, Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armenians:</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> (being professed <HI>Christians</HI>) were raised unto much love to me, they understanding I owned my self a <HI>Christian,</HI> and chused rather to die than to turn from my Religion: And the <HI>Turks</HI> were raised to a loving moderate enquiry, being I suffered and went through great things, yet differed from all others. The <HI>Jews</HI> in them parts were moderate towards me likewise.</P>
<P>According to the afore-mentioned Or∣der, I was brought to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but being come thither, the Friars laid wait for me, and by their appointment I was taken and brought to their Convent, where at first they seemingly shewed love unto me, and
<PB N="290" REF="147"/> one confessed, <HI>there was now an evident sign that I was a good Christian, for I was come through Persecution and Sufferings; and those things which had been spoken of me to the con∣trary were manifest to be untrue.</HI> I answered, It was he and his brethren which had per∣secuted and caused me to suffer, and with∣stood my coming to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> He said, <HI>The English</HI> (a Friar like himself) <HI>had in∣formed them by writing against me, which caused them to do what they had done unto me, and desired I would now pass those things by, seeing I was come in such a miraculous manner; for it was the Lord's work</HI> (said he) <HI>to carry me through, and I might praise God I was preserved.</HI> The next morning there came a Friar unto me, and asked me, <HI>If I would become an obedient child, and go to visit the Holy Places</HI> (as he called them) <HI>accord∣ing to their customs?</HI> I answered, Nay, I should not visit them. He said, <HI>Whereas others give great sums of money to see them, I should see them for nothing.</HI> I answered, Nay, I should not visit them in their man∣ner, for in so doing I should sin against God. He said, <HI>they would honour me as much as ever they honoured any English-man that ever came thither, if I would conform unto them.</HI> I said, Nay, I should not conform;
<PB N="291" REF="147"/> and as for their honor, I mattered not for it. Then he became wrath and said, <HI>They would make me an example to all English-men that should come thither.</HI> I said, I chose ra∣ther their dishonour than their honour. He then seeing he could not prevail over me with his temptations, he in anger passed from me, and in a short time came again, and called me to divers of his Brethren; the chief among them asked me, <HI>If I would visit their Church, and the holy Sepulchre, and</HI> Bethlehem, <HI>and the rest of the holy places, as other Pilgrims did?</HI> I said, at the present I had no business to visit them, and in their manner I should not visit them at all (that is to say, worship them) Then one of them said, <HI>How could I be a Servant of God, and would not go to visit the places where the holy men of God dwelt?</HI> I answered, That they, under pretence of doing service to God, in visiting the places where the holy men dwelt, they did oppose that Way, and resist that Life, which the holy men of God lived and walked in. One of them said, <HI>What, did I preach unto them?</HI> I said, I would have them turn from those evil practices they lived in, else the Wrath of the Almighty would break forth upon them, or words to that effect. They further said, <HI>If I would
<PB N="292" REF="148"/> not go to visit the places before-mentioned, would I give the</HI> 25. <HI>Dollers, as is the manner of those that visited them? for</HI> (said they) <HI>the Turks must be paid whether I would visit them or not; but if I would visit them, then they would pay it for me.</HI> I said, I would not have them to pay it for me; but if the <HI>Turks</HI> had a Law to compel me to pay 25. Dollers when I visited not the places, as those did pay that did visit them, I said that Law was unequal; and I should chuse rather to suffer the penalty of the same in breaking it, than to give 25. Dollers to fulfil it.</P>
<P>After this the Popish Friars brought me before a <HI>Turk</HI> in Authority in that place, who asked me di∣vers Questions, and soberly received Answers ther∣unto; and soberly discoursed with me about the Worship of the <HI>Christians;</HI> and also asked me the ground of my coming to <HI>Jerusalem?</HI> I answered him, The Lord God of Heaven and Earth had ap∣peared unto me, and commanded me to come thi∣ther, and in obedience unto him I was come; and further, in the power of the Lord I declared the great and tender love of God in visiting them, and his great and compassionate mercies that he would gather them in this the Day of his gathering. And this was that which lay upon me from the Lord to declare unto them, whether they would hear or forbear.</P>
<P>And thus, my dear Friends, I cleared my Con∣science, whether they would hear or forbear; wher∣in I found great peace with the Lord, who in my many tryals was not wanting unto me, but magnified his glorious Name in going along with me, and pre∣serving me; to whom is all the glory due for ever∣more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
