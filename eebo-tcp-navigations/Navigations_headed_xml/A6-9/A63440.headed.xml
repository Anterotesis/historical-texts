<HEAD>A true and perfect Relation of the Apprehension of five Fryers, one Pilgrim, and three Souldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOt to trouble my Reader with any tedi∣ous preamble to little or no purpose, but to come readily and truly to the matter in hand, which being such an extraordi∣nary passage, of Gods good providence towards this Land and Nation; in preserving us from the daily Plots and wicked machinations of his and our adversaries. It is not fit it should lye al together smother'd up in the pit of oblivion; but be divulg'd and spread abroad in each cor∣ner of this Kingdome, that so all true hearted Protestants may know, and knowing, may un∣derstand how infinitely they are ingaged to blesse God for such wonderfull deliverances, and with <HI>David</HI> extoll his Name, from one ge∣neration to another.</P>
<P>It were needlesse to stand upon particulars in a poynt so plaine and obvious to the eye of every faithfull Protestant.</P>
<P>If you aske who's our adversaries, the questi∣on
<PB REF="3"/>is soone answered, who? But the Jesuites, Fryers, Papists Priests, and others of the wicked adherents to the sect of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>If you aske how this is manifested, daily ex∣perience proves it; how many hellish Plots and Conspiracies hath this infernall tribe hatcht a∣gainst these his Majesties Kingdomes of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> since the beginning of re∣formation? When the Illustrious splendor of the Gospell first began to shine in our Brittish Horizon to this present, poore afflicted <HI>Ireland</HI> can sadly witnesse the truth hereof, whose de∣plorable condition at this time, by the cruell inhumanity and barbarous actions of the blood thirsty Papists, against the faithfull Professors of the Protestant Religion in that Kingdome, would extract teares from a heart of flint, to heare that such tygers should be coucht under the shapes of men, but the particulars of this their tyranny, is well knowne to all men.</P>
<P>I shall not therefore insist upon that or any other discourse, but come briefely to this last project, hatch by their grand-father the Devill, blest by their holy father the Pope, put in pra∣ctice by his children, the Fryars and Jesuites; but discovered by God, whose never slumbring eye continually sees, and seeing, derides all such foolish combinations against his Church and people, and now brought to light, that all true Christians and subjects may bee thank∣full
<PB REF="3"/>for the same, and praise the great Name of the Lord for ever and ever.</P>
<P>In March last 1642, a certaine ship under the conduct of <HI>Patrick Sym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> who was Master thereof, should have transported it into <HI>Ireland,</HI> with these passengers, whose names are as fol∣loweth, <HI>Thomas Fastell, Teage Barr, Patrick Carr, Richard Birke, Francis Cauthon,</HI> Fryars; <HI>Malathyn Gaggon</HI> Pilgrim; <HI>Thomas Moham, Bryant Mackall Greahall, Daniel Brianon</HI> Souldiers.</P>
<P>This goodly company being minded to visit their traitorous Confederates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon what enterprise is not yet knowne, untill the wisedome of the Parliament shall further exa∣mine the businesse; but being greatly suspected, and not without good cause, both shippe and passengers were stayd in their journey at Saint <HI>Ives</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> by the Vice-Admîrall <HI>M. Basset,</HI> and information presently given to the Parlia∣ment, who immediatly made an Order, dire∣cted to the Sheriffes of each County, to pro∣vide stron guards for their safe conduct to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> which was accordingly performed, and they committed to New-gate on Friday the 9 of Aprill 1642, where now they remaine expe∣cting the pleasure of that Honorable Assembly for their further tryall.</P>
