</LIST></P>
<P>In all which he expresseth how cordially, and conscientious∣ly, he abominated so horrid a Tragedy as will be discovered in handling these particulars, unto the exposition whereof I next proceed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The exposition of the first particular.</HEAD>
<P>The distinguishing appellation, <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi.</HI> And why they named above all the rest, it being evident that the other sonnes of <HI>Jacob</HI> were actors in the designe as well as they, and that in revenge too, Gen. 37.27? It is true, they were actors in the work of revenge, but not the manner of acting: the comming of sore selfe submitted and wounded men three dayes after a Treaty, and a seeming reconciliation, when they thought them∣selves safe, and feared no such revengefull act, the comming (I say) upon men at such a time, and in such a condition and putting them to death in cold bloud, was the sole designe of those two by name, and was (as the 25. verse plainly expresseth it) acted by them alone; and therefore in this definitive sen∣tence which <HI>Jacob</HI> passed upon that bloudy fact, and the judge∣ment which hee pre-threatned should fall upon the actors, by their proper names he distinguisheth them two from the rest, and points at them, that so it might be unquestionably evident that they were the men.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Observations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Observe hence in the first place that in criminall causes of so bloody and cruell a nature, a definitive sentence (whether of death, or of judgement) is not to be pronounced (much lesse hastily executed) upon surmises or suggestions; but only upon reall evidence, for undisputable reasons, and upon sufficient grounds.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<P N="2">2. In the records of such inhumane Tragedies and cruell executions, the contrivers and actors may <HI>digito demonstrari &amp; dici hi sunt,</HI> be poynted out by name to distinguish them from others, and said of these are the men; <HI>Jacob</HI> doth so heere, <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Application.</HEAD>
<P>The contrivees and principall actors (in the execution of Sir <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> and Sir <HI>George Lyle,</HI> upon a bare surmise of having no Commission, and at best but upon a disputable rea∣son) having neglected the duty required in the former observa∣tion, have purchased to themselves the guilt of <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Le∣vi,</HI> the cruel murther of two worthy men, though submitted to mercy, and therefore in our making mention of that inhu∣mane Tragedy may be distinguished from others by their pro∣per appellation, and by name pointed at <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> as <HI>Simeon,</HI> and <HI>Levi, brethren in iniquity,</HI> which is the second particular.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The exposition of the second particular</HEAD>
<P N="2">2. The stigmatizing compellation, <HI>brethren in iniquity;</HI> bre∣thren, not so much in respect of their affinity or neerenesse of blood, as of the vicinity and complyance of their affections in plotting the treachery, and likewise of the conjuncture of, or e∣quall readinesse in their desires to effect so inhumane a villany; <HI>fratres in iniquitate,</HI> that is saith one, <HI>similimi &amp; conjunctissimi scelere, putà feritate, audacia, dolo &amp; crudelitate,</HI> they were link't in the same bands of iniquity, alike possessed with a re∣vengefull, fierce, crafty, and cruel desire of blood, brethren in iniquity (that is) with the same degree of affection, complot∣ters, and contrivers of this violent bloody designe.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Observations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. There are commonly partners in contriving cruel de∣signes, brethren that will be ready to lay their heads together in plotting bloody villany, and evill actions shall not want as∣sociates,
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>companions in their executions: As <HI>bonum,</HI> so <HI>malum,</HI> is <HI>sui diffusivum,</HI> seldome is mischiefe agitated to perfection without two heads; cast in thy lot among us, wee will have but one purse, wee will be brethren, Pro. 1.14. is the insinua∣ting policy of those whose designes are violence, revenge, or blood: Witnesse the two Elders in the story of <HI>Susanna,</HI> were it not Apocryphall, but in that which is Canonicall, <HI>Big∣than</HI> and <HI>Teresh</HI> in the booke of <HI>Hester,</HI> 2.21. <HI>Jozachar,</HI> and <HI>Jehozabad,</HI> in the 2 of Kings 12.21. and <HI>Simeon,</HI> and <HI>Levi,</HI> in the Text.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Application.</HEAD>
<P>And want there witnesses to this truth in our dayes? No <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>treton</HI> were the joynt contrivers, and designers of the late cruel execution of his Majesties and Kingdomes two loyall Subjects at Colchester; though their death were assented to by <HI>their</HI> Counsell of War, and acted by their Souldiers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Brethren in iniquity,</HI> they are recorded to be, brethren they were, so far the compellation might stand with their re∣putation and be for their credit, as being a badge of honour; but <HI>in iniquity</HI> being added, it tends to their shame and disgrace, and proves the brand of their infamy, charactizing their cruel∣ty and villany: Foule actions deserve for their authors foule denominations, and the contrivers of odious designes, are wor∣thy to be stigmatized with odious names.</P>
<P>If <HI>Jeroboam</HI> (to compasse his ambitious ends) make all Isra∣el turne Rebell; God thinkes fit to set this marke of disgrace upon his name. <HI>Jeroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne,</HI> 1 Kings 16.26. and if <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> (to execute their revengefull ends) will be like in complotting a designe of cruelty, they shall be conjoyned in a character demonstrating their villany: brethren in a plot of inhumanity <HI>Jacob</HI> stig∣matizes with the compellation of, <HI>brethren in iniquity:</HI> And this is done that so the generations to come, reading the odious∣nesse of such crimes in the disgracefulnesse of the authors com∣pellations or (nicknames) may be afraid of the brand, and if they would not receive it, be so afraid of the sinne as not to commit it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>The Application.</HEAD>
<P>And now you that are <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levies</HI> parallels, are yee moved and startled at this stigmatizing compellation? you should then have been moved by their example and shame, and startled at the contriving and designing so parallell an executi∣on; since you have not been afraid to imitate <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Le∣vi,</HI> in the transgression, I will not be afraid to imitate <HI>Jacob</HI> by this Transition, <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> bretheren in iniquity; yea and to charge you with the impeachment charged upon them in the affirmative position, and the third particular.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The exposition of the third particular.</HEAD>
<P>The affirmative position, charge or impeachment; <HI>the in∣struments of cruelty are in their habitations;</HI> that is all the in∣fernall affections of their mindes, all the externall Members of their bodies, and all the weaons of war that they were furni∣shed with, were wholely converted to the acting cruelty, all were imployed by them to this end to execute this bloody de∣signe.</P>
<P>What cruelty, and weapons! instruments of cruelty in the habitations of the chosen seed! Yes, for it is heere positively affirmed, that the instruments of cruelty were in the habitati∣ons of the sonnes of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the faithfull sonne of God and godly grand-child of the Father of the faithfull, <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Observations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The true seed of the promise, the chosen seed declared so by God himselfe, may harbour intentions of, and proceed to be actors in cruel designes; witnesse the occasion of these words of <HI>Jacob</HI> on his death bed, <HI>viz.</HI> the deliberated and consulted murther of <HI>Hamor</HI> and <HI>Shechem,</HI> though concealed by deceit∣full communications, parlies, or treaties, till by their submissi∣on to <HI>Siweon</HI> and <HI>Levies</HI> desires, they had given them advan∣tage
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>and opportunity to effect the same, which they made use of, and in cold blood, the third day after they had them at their mercy with their swords, they fell upon them and slew them, who had made themselves unable to resist or defend them∣selves by yielding to that proposition, which they did beleeve had been made to no other end then to effect a reconciliation in peace, love, and union: For this crafty dealing with <HI>Hamor</HI> and <HI>Shechem,</HI> till they had got them to submit in a manner to their mercy, and then in cold blood murthering of them, doth <HI>Jacob</HI> charge them heere with this impeachment, positively affirming that the instruments of cruelty were in their habita∣tions, and that was the occasion of this his speech upon his death bed, and is a proofe of the truth of this observation that, men, who are declared to be of the chosen seed, and that by the testimony of God himselfe, may harbour intentions of, and proceed to be actors in cruel designes, and may imploy all the faculties of their soules and members of their bodies to effect the same.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Application.</HEAD>
<P>And have wee not them in our dayes who beare witnesse to this truth also, and who may be truely charged with this im∣peachment? Yes, for that <HI>their</HI> hearts (who seeme to others, and report themselves to be the elect and chosen of God, Saints, and holy ones) that <HI>their</HI> hearts (I say) may contrive mischiefe, and with Davids cruel man, Psal. 140.2. imagine evill things, and harbour war continually; but yet with <HI>their</HI> tongues talke deceitfully.</P>
<P>That the words of <HI>their</HI> mouthes may be softer then butter, and more gentle then oyle, and yet their thoughts at that time be very swords forged for the war, which is in their hearts.</P>
<P>When by craft they have got an advantage, that <HI>their</HI> feet my make haste to execute premeditated revenge, and be swift in running to doe mischiefe.</P>
<P>That <HI>their</HI> hands may be ever ready to shed blood, and <HI>their</HI> right hand the right hand of falshood, whilst it takes by the beard to kisse, smiting its sword into the fift rib to kill, 2 Sam.
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>20.9.10. In a word: That all the affections of <HI>their</HI> soules, (though religiously seeming, but deceitfull, be the words of their mouthes) members of <HI>their</HI> bodies, and swords by <HI>their</HI> sides (who in our dayes are termed the chosen of God, Saints and holy ones) may prove instruments of cruelty, is a truth ful∣ly justified by the late act of <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> parallell to this of <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> heere, the putting to the sword these two valiant Commanders. Sir <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> and Sir <HI>George Lysle</HI> in cold blood, the third day after they had yeelded them∣selves to their mercy, and within two houres after notice given to them of death; and therefore wee may say of them that the instruments of cruelty are in their habitation. Thats the first observation.</P>
<P>But before I touch upon the second, it is requisite that we re∣vive, and consider the whole story.</P>
<P><HI>Shechem</HI> the sonne of <HI>Hamor</HI> an uncircumcised Canaanite had wrought Villany in Israel. Gen. 34 7. committed that which was to the reproach of <HI>Jacob</HI> and his sonnes, v. 14. both these by <HI>Jacob</HI> were past by with silence, and their redresse com∣mitted to the Lord, and by <HI>Sechem</HI> endeavoured to be satis∣fied and repaired: to this end <HI>Shechem</HI> desires a Personall Trea∣ty (the sole meanes with Gods blessing to effect a reconciliati∣on, if without hypocrisie) <HI>Jacob</HI> consents really, intending a reconciliation with <HI>Shechem,</HI> who intreated it with humble sub∣mission; and with <HI>Hamor</HI> who had propounded it, with pro∣mise of a considerable satisfaction: with his sincerity, and integrity had the matter been ended peaceably, betweene <HI>them</HI> who had no other ends but love, peace, union, and amity.</P>
<P>But the sonns of <HI>Jacob,</HI> pretending to embrace the motion, intend to compasse their premeditated revenge, and in Order thereunto begin their cruelty with craft, and shroud their craft under the cloak of Religion: If you will submit to our disci∣pline, serve the God whom we serve, and receive on your Bo∣dies the badge or ensigne of our Covenant, according to the Ordinance of God, circumcision, then may we yeeld to your desires, otherwais know we cannot do this thing; <HI>wee cannot give our sister to an uncircumcised man</HI> Gen. 34.14. a covenant
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>intended not for the salvation of the soule, but the destruction of the body.</P>
<P>The Fatherly affection to the sonne, and the intended con∣jugall affection to the desired Wife, cause both <HI>Hamor</HI> and <HI>She∣chem</HI> (waving the painfullnesse of the execution) to embrace that condition themselves, and to perswade their people there∣unto; also they dissemble with them, as they themselves had been dissembled with by <HI>Jacobs</HI> sonnes; common profit is pre∣tended in order thereunto; (<HI>shall not their flocks and substance be ours?</HI> Gen. 34.23.) though <HI>Shechems</HI> love was therein on∣ly meant (the hope of profit is the most powerfull motive to the common People, and the mention of commodity makes the vulger sort proud to be prodigall of their skin and blood) there∣fore they also are content to smart; and so all put the knife to their owne fore-skins: and now <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> taking ad∣vantage of this submission to their mercy, and inability to make resistance by reason the sorenes of the Shechemites own-given wounds, <HI>on the third day tooke either of them his sword and went into the City boldly, and slew every male, v.</HI> 25. This designe ta∣ken in hand upon so just a cause but carryed on with such craft, dissimulation, and hypocrisie, and in cold blood so barbarously executed, is by <HI>Jacob</HI> sharpely reprehended in them, Gen. 34.30 and heere made a charge, impeachment, or affirmative po∣sition of their cruelty, the instruments of cruelty are in their habitations: This premised, the second Doctrinall conclusion will be this.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Doct.</HI> Though the uncircumcised Infidels, worke villany in Israel, Gen. 34.7. and commit an act to the shame and re∣proach of the faithfull promised seed, Christians, Gen. 34.14. and afterwards with humble submission sue for an honourable reconciliation, in hopes by a Personall Treaty, to conclude all in love peace, union, and amity, and thereupon yeeld them∣selves up to their mercy; yet if Israel, Christians, Saints take advantage of such submission, and in cold blood murther those uncircumcised Infidels, this charge may be justly put in, and this impeachment drawne up against them, <HI>cruelty are in their habitations,</HI> this is <HI>Iacobs</HI> charge against <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi;</HI> yea
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>although (which is more) the designe of the Shechemites were to possesse themselves of the flocks, substance, and all the cattle of <HI>Iacob,</HI> and all his sonnes, Gen. 34.23.</P>

<HEAD>The Application.</HEAD>
<P>This charge hen I must draw up, and this impeachment put in against <HI>fairfax</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> those principall actors in that ry∣ot, which in cold blood was committed on the lives of those two worthy Christian Cavaliers, Sir <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Lisle,</HI> by their according to their owne report) elected selves, and holy Worthies, that Army of Saints, as the deluded, seduced, blinded, or besotted people of this Land terme them: For if that bloody fact committed by <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi,</HI> upon <HI>Hamor</HI> and <HI>Shechem,</HI> Infidels; For which yet they might pre∣tend some cause, and had a faire colour, were by <HI>Jacob</HI> justly condemned, and this charge put in against them, <HI>that cruelty was in their habitations:</HI> Certainely I may be bold to put in the same impeachment against <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> and declame against, that their bloody act as the quintescence of cruelty, and putting to the sword, after a submission to mercy, those two noble Christians, who had not injured them at all, much lesse in so high a nature; who tooke up armes only to recover their owne substance, and not to possesse themselves of theirs, and were gathered together in a body, to no other end then by a Personall Treaty to compose all differences, satisfie all publick interests, and effect an happy reconciliation between the King and his Subjects, and between the subjects themselves, that so the King might live in glory and command, the subjects in plenty and obedience, and all in peace, righteousnesse, and fit∣ting liberty (which <HI>Fairfax, Ireton,</HI> and the rest of their ad∣herents pretended in all their Remonstrances and Declarations; in which it is apparently they talk't but deceitfully)</P>
<P>And shall men of these principles, taking up armes to these good and religious ends, after they are over powred, and have yeelded to the mercy of the Victors, in cold blood be shot to death? and yet shall they that have been chiefe plotters and actors, with their adherents and abettors be looked upon and acknowledged the elect children, the chosen people? No, let
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>them be pointed at by their knowne appellations or proper names, <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> as being prodigies of nature, stig∣matized with their deserved character or proper appelation, <HI>brethren in iniquity,</HI> as the shame branded shame of their Nati∣on, and charged with that impeachment (unto which them∣selves cannot but plead guilty, and none that impartially com∣pares the circumstances will acquit of as innocent) this affir∣mative position, <HI>the instruments of cruelty are in their tents or habitations, Psal.</HI> 14. as the scorne of truely valiant souldiers: And therefore heere I conjure all that would not be thought to have a favour to, or an hand in so foule an act, with their soules to abjure their secrets or counsells, and with their bodies to a∣void their companies, Assemblies, Committees, or Counsels of war, as good old <HI>Jacob</HI> doth teach them by his example heere; and so I come to the fourth particular.</P>

<HEAD>Observations.</HEAD>
<P>A good man should conjure his spirit and inward man not to partake with bloody men in their secretly contrived machi∣nations and counsells; but to adjue and utterly renounce all voted either Ordinances of close Committees, or Orders of a Counsell of War, that tend to the execution of any cruel design.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unto their Assembly, O mine honour be not thou united; that is, O my glory, honour or reputation, if thou desiret to be preserved, I conjure thee to abjure, renounce, utterly disclaime the companies of such bloody projectors, to avoid the societies of such inhumane voters, and then to have no union with the congregations or assemblies of such implacable and mercilesse Councellors: If they account it their glory and honour to be an Assembly that can doe what they will without controule; much good may it doe them, but far be such honour from me.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<P>A good man as he will conjure his inward man not to con∣sent to such bloody machinations, nor affect such cruel counsels; so will he also conjure his outward man not so much as to joyn it selfe with such companions, nor be an instrument with their assemblies to effect such cruel actions; as he will not joyn with them in the consultation or contriving of them, so neither in the execution or effecting them, as the faculties of his soule shall not be counsellours, so neither shall the members of his body be actors of such foule proceedings, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did conjure both here, O my soule, &amp;c. unto their Assembly, not to joyne with them either in thought, word, or deed, either in inward affection or outward action, of which conjuration in himselfe, and as an argument to provoke others thereunto: in the next whods he declares the ground, cause or reason thereof, thereby to move in others a detestation or hatred of two actions; the effects of a twofold passion, and the fifth partionlar.</P>

<HEAD>Observation.</HEAD>
<P>Some natures are not satisfied but with the life blood of their injuers, nor will some mens anger be reconciled, but hunt im∣placably for the life of its object.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of their selfe-wilfull revenge <HI>and in their selfe-will they digged down a wall,</HI> that is wilfully bent upon revenge they pro∣secuted it with such violence, that nothing was of force to hin∣der the executing thereof; a wall shall not resist the fury of malice, but downe goes that too before they will be prevented: that is saith one, in the night they brake downe the wall of <HI>She∣chem,</HI> which stood betwixt them and the object of their re∣venge, and entring at the breach did act that bloody tragedy; But I shall thus expound it, by craft and policy having undermi∣ned, circumvented, <HI>Hamor</HI> and <HI>Shechem</HI> the two stoutest Com∣manders,
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>who by their valour were as a wall unto their City, and whose undaunted courage, they durst not singly, and upon equall tearmes meet or incounter, but now over powred by this crafty advantage, they dig them downe, that is as it is the na∣ture of all cowards, they slay them and insult upon them in their fall.</P>

<P>And now how neere a resemblance there was betweene the manner of <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levies</HI> taking away the lives of <HI>Hamor</HI> and <HI>Shechem,</HI> and of <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Iretons</HI> destroying those two valiant Commanders in <HI>Colch-ster;</HI> and what a vast dispropor∣tion there was betwixt the causes that provoked both of them to so cowardly, bloody an act, I shall leave it to any endued with common sense and reason to judge; and I doubt not but it will be a powerfull argument to provoke all who will not be thought to have a favour to, or hand in so base and unworthy an action to adjure the counsells or secrets, renounce the compa∣nies or assemblies, and depart from the tents of such wicked worthlesse men, from their soules detesting such cowardly cru∣elty, and such inhumane butchery, which was so abominable in the sence and apprehension of the good old Patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI> (though in his sons) that the consideration thereof caused him to convert his last words to them, which should have been a benediction into a malediction; <HI>cursed be their wrath for it was fierce, and their rage for it was cruel:</HI> and to period his speech of them with a prophetick divination, and fatall prediction against them, <HI>I will divide them in</HI> Jacob, <HI>and scatter them in</HI> Israel, which containes the two last particulars,</P>

<HEAD>The exposition of the <HI>2</HI> last particulars.</HEAD>
<P N="6">6. Cursed the their
<LIST>
<ITEM>Wrath,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rage,</ITEM>
</LIST> For it was
<LIST>
<ITEM>Feirce,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cruel.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Cursed, that is, ill successe may it have, may such a thing ne∣ver prosper, or be blest by God or man; But may men for the future tremble at it as an Anathema, and shun it as a Maranatha, a thing deserving the malediction of men, and bitter curse of God.</P>
<P>Their wrath, their progresse in passion, the cherrishing that humour, and harbouring that ill affection.</P>
<P>Their rage, wrath, hightned to a perfection, or the highest de∣gree
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>of passion; for there are three degrees of passion.</P>
<P>The first is anger a sudden, but short collition of the humors.</P>
<P>The second is wrath, a continuance of the disturbance, and a countenancing of the passion.</P>
<P>The last is rage, the discomposure degreed unto perfection by savouring and feeding the passion, the effects whereof are exe∣cuted with implacable cruelty.</P>
<P>Be angry but sinne not, passionmay forcibly break in upon us, but we must not cherish it till it prove wrath, muchlesse hu∣mor it to perfection till it becomes rage, breaking out into cru∣ell effects, that is to sinne, and that sinne is here curst: <HI>Cursed be their wrath their rage;</HI> cursed be their sinfull actions, not per∣sons, the person bears the stampe, or image of God, therefore hopes of reconciliation upon reformation; but sin defaceth that stamp, deformeth that image, therefore cursed to prevent the committing thereof by imitation.</P>
<P><HI>Cursed be their wrath for it was fierce,</HI> violent in the encrease, rage for it was cruell, implacable at the full growth: <HI>Passio igi∣tur dignasane maledictione;</HI> these qualities render them worthy of a curse, and were the cause of <HI>Jacobs</HI> cursing, as himselfe here testifies.</P>
<P>Good men are such lover of equity, that although they know they may justly pronounce a malediction against the sin, yet they hold it convenient to produce the cause, so good a man was <HI>Jacob,</HI> from whose rule not to digresse.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Application.</HEAD>
<P>Let us consult those very men themselves, who were the Ac∣tors in that Tragedy at Colchester: Say, ye the two heads of our new and new qualified Israel, ye holy Leaders of that Army of Saints! may we not say cursed be your wrath for it was fierce? did not your anger swell to that height in the prosecution of the ends at which it aymed, that it would upon no tearmes ad∣mit of so much as a Treaty, much lesse hearken to the honest meanes of reconciliation with them till they had submitted to your mercy? and was it not then fierce? and after they had submitted to your mercy, can you deny that your rage would not be satisfied with any thing but their lives? and was it not then cruel? wrath thus fierce in the encrease, rage thus cruel in
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>the full growth as certainly worthy of a curse; Cursed then be your wrath for it was fierce, and your rage for it was cruel.</P>
<P>And may the 7. particular <HI>Jacobs</HI> fatall predictions be fulfilled in you and your assissinates for conclusion: may you be divided among your selves, may you be disperst amongst others, for the Lord may be said to pronounce this sentence, aswell against you that have more then justified <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> by imitations, as against them that set you downe their owne example for your instruction: <HI>I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel;</HI> it is just with God to divide them, thereby to make way for a mercy upon a Kingdome, who so easily were united in their forces and affections to bring miseryupon a Kingdome; and it is policy to disperse them, who in a body have contrived and acted so many cruell designes, to the ruine and destruction of so many families, lest they should againe be gathered to an head, <HI>tali suo consilio aliis perniciem machinentur,</HI> by such Coun∣sels hatch and exercise the like cruelties on others, to this, that they have executed on the forenamed valiant Champions; to whose immortall honour, but the shame of the cruel contrivers and actors of their death, I record this transition for the conclu∣sion.</P>
<P><HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Ireton; Brethren in iniquitie,</HI> the instruments of cruelty are in their habitations, quarters, Tents, or Armies; or their swords are instruments of violence: <HI>Oh my soule! come not thou into their secret, unto their Assembly, Oh mine honour! be not thou united;</HI> for in their wrath upon premeditation they slew Sir <HI>Charle Lucas,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Lisle,</HI> and in their self-will they craftily undermined, and after submission to mercy, in cold bloud cruelly murdered those two valiant Commanders, who had by their incomparable valour and undaunted courage, like a wall defended <HI>Colchester: Cursed be their wrath for it was fierce, and their rage for it was cruel.</HI></P>
<P>And what <HI>Jacob</HI> did foretell of them by way of prophesie; I will beg by way of prayer for these; divide them Lord a∣mong themselves heere in England, and scatter or disband them among the Inhabitants of all his Majesties Dominionsk, that such a mercilesse pack of so cruel blood thirsty Tyrants may never gather to an head againe to destroy the people and dis∣turbe
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>the peace of this thy Israel. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And wheresoever they shall like <HI>Cain,</HI> their brother, and first murtherer, wander, let this still be presented to their thoughts, for a scourge unto their soules.</P>
