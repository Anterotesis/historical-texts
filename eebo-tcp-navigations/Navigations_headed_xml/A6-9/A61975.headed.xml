<HEAD>A Summary Narration OF THE Signal Victory which it pleased Al∣mighty God to bestow upon his Ma∣jesties Navy, under the Command of his Royall Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> against the Fleet of the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Netherlands,</HI> the 3. of <HI>June</HI> 1665.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is for <HI>general satisfaction,</HI> and to pre∣vent <HI>Misreports</HI> (which are cōmonly through ignorance or malice be∣gotten upon occasions of this na∣ture) that this present <HI>Narrative</HI> is printed. And to the end that it may be rendred distinctly and intelligibly (the matter bearing it very well on our side,) it shal begin with the first appearance
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>of the <HI>Dutch Fleet,</HI> on our <HI>Coast;</HI> brought thither rather (in all probability) in expectation of finding Ours in disorder upon the preceding foul weather, and drawn by the reports of our unreadiness, then from their own innate va∣lour, though the report of the story shews they had sufficient of that to accompany them in this great undertaking.</P>
<P>Upon their <HI>first appearance,</HI> which was on <HI>June</HI> 2d. at 2 of the clock, it cost his <HI>Royall Highness</HI> but little time to make ready; his foregoing care, and the chearfulness of our men, having pre∣vented all hazzard of disorder; And the happy arrival of the <HI>Colliers Fleet</HI> at that instant, having supplyed the onely want we had, of Men: Which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet no sooner perceived, but they stood off to sea again, keeping the wind of us, sometimes standing again, to see whether indeed We durst follovv them, keeping them∣selves in good order. Their number vvas then judged to be 10 <HI>Sail,</HI> and 10 <HI>Fire-ships.</HI> The first good Omen that shevved it self on Our side, vvas the firing a great Ship of theirs that Even∣ing, then believed to be one of their Flag Ships, which vve since have learned vvas a great Fire-ship so disguised to do the more mischief.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 2. We follovved them till night; and
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>endeavoured by several <HI>Tacks</HI> to get the Wind∣vvard quarter, vvhich his <HI>Royall Highness</HI> happi∣ly effected, being not full tvvo leagues further into the sea then vve vvere the Evening before: vvhich being gained, they bore up tovvards us, and gave the first <HI>Broad side</HI> at <HI>Sunrising Saturday</HI> 3. But finding they could not get from us, they bore up to <HI>Vice Admiral Minnes,</HI> and gave him a <HI>broadside,</HI> who received them accordingly; and so their whole <HI>Fleet</HI> passed by <HI>Ours,</HI> string at every ship as they went, and receiving re∣turnes from them; not one of either side be∣ing out of play at this first encounter. Imme∣diately upon which, his <HI>Royall Highness</HI> made his signe for the <HI>tacking,</HI> that we might still keep the wind of them, which was happily executed, notwithstanding that the <HI>enemy</HI> also strove for it. In the <HI>second pass,</HI> the <HI>Swiftsure</HI> bore the <HI>first brunt,</HI> which was performed on both sides as the former. In the <HI>third</HI> (wherein we also kept the wind) <HI>Prince Rupert,</HI> and <HI>Cap∣tain Minnes</HI> led the way but the Enemy, endea∣vouring to get the head of our whole Fleet, we engaged in a line, and as we bore towards them, they still bore off, yet steering the same Course, so that it was not then a fight of <HI>board and board,</HI> But offending one another with great shot, we being at too great a distance to
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>make use of our small; which way of fighting seeming tedious to us, about one of the Clock we passed so near about the middle of them, that we devided their Fleet. About three of the <HI>Clock Opdams</HI> Ship was blown up; as we suppose by a lucky shot in the <HI>powder-room,</HI> which amazed <HI>Their</HI> whole Fleet, as it encou∣raged <HI>Ours,</HI> so we fell in <HI>Pell-mell,</HI> with them. After vvhich, it will be hard, till stories are well composed, to give a particular account of vvhat hapned: Upon the vvhole matter, God hath been pleased to give his Majestie <HI>a great</HI> and <HI>signal Victory,</HI> the <HI>enemy</HI> being driven into the <HI>Texell</HI> as far as the draught of vvater and the condition of our ships vvould permit; the day being also very far spent: the summe of all is, the enemies vvhole Fleet is defeated; the greatest part of them gone into the <HI>Texel,</HI> o∣thers into the <HI>Maes;</HI> about 30 of them <HI>burnt</HI> or <HI>taken. Opdam</HI> vvith his <HI>ship, blown up; Tromp</HI> and <HI>Cortenaer, Skram</HI> and <HI>Stellingwersse,</HI> all their 7 <HI>Admirals</HI> but <HI>John Evertson</HI> killed; vvith ma∣ny more of their principal Officers, and accord∣ing to their general computation neare 8000. <HI>seamen</HI> and <HI>souldiers;</HI> on <HI>our side</HI> only one single ship, (the <HI>Charity</HI>) lost, Sir <HI>John Lawson</HI> received a slight hurt in his knee, the Lord of <HI>Marle∣borough;</HI> The Lord of <HI>Portland;</HI> Captain <HI>Athel∣ton</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>of the <HI>Guiny,</HI> Captain <HI>Kirby</HI> of the <HI>Breda,</HI> and <HI>Rear Admiral Sanson,</HI> vvere slain; Also the Lord of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Muskery</HI> and Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> which three last vvere killed by one unhap∣py shot on board his <HI>Royal Highness,</HI> and close to his ovvn person: God of Heaven be prais∣ed for having preserved him to be the great In∣strument of so signal a success, to the honour of His Majesty; and the good of his peo∣ple.</P>
