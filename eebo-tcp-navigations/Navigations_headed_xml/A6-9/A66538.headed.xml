<HEAD><HI>THE CASE OF</HI> JOHN WILMORE Truly <HI>and</HI> Im∣partially <HI>Related,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOlomon</HI> the wisest of Men saith, <HI>there is a time for all things, a time to speak and a time to keep silence;</HI> and if ever a time for the latter; surely it is <HI>now:</HI> For let a Man Act, Speak or Write never so much for the true Interest of the King and Kingdom, and the ancient Constitutions of the same, and he shall be sure to be discanted upon and <HI>ridiculed,</HI> and the words wrested and tur∣ned from the plain and genuine Sence of them by the sophistical <HI>canting Infe∣rences</HI> and false Reasonings of Mr. <HI>Observator</HI> and his Fellows, who as is plain∣ly seen to the meanest thinking men, are driving on furiously, <HI>Jehu</HI> like for setting up a <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary</HI> interest in the Nations, and though their <HI>bait</HI> be cryed up to be loyal Protestants, and for the Government as establi∣shed; yet their <HI>Roman hooks</HI> and <HI>French Lines</HI> cannot be hid, I do expect great comments by them will be made upon the putting out of my Case, and how I might have spared my pains in troubling of the World with a large <HI>Ig∣noramus</HI> Story, for that there is a <HI>Verdict</HI> against me, that shews what I am, with much more such stuff. Now had my Case been <HI>single,</HI> and I had suffered never so unjustly by it, though it had been my ruine, I would have been silent, and with patience waited the time of the <HI>Great Lord Chief Justice</HI> of all the earth, whose Commission is in himself for ever, and who will do right, and cannot do wrong, for he is infallible, and no respecter of persons. But con∣sidering as I am made the first <HI>Example</HI> of this kind, and may not be the <HI>last,</HI> especially if Popish malice see it for their advantage, seeing <HI>many thousands</HI> of people are concerned in most of the considerable parts of this Kingdom, and <HI>Ireland,</HI> either in one Plantation or other in <HI>America,</HI> I thought it my du∣ty for <HI>their sakes</HI> to give the World a true and impartial <HI>State</HI> of my Case, that it might be a <HI>Looking-Glass</HI> to them, thereby to see what they must ex∣pect, if malice will prosecute.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with any thing done in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> least it should be reflected upon as arraigning the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Nation, I shall only give you the Truth of it, as it was before it went in there, and something of their witnesses. Were my Accusation as <HI>Tompson</HI> and his gang have given out for being a <HI>Kidnapper</HI> or <HI>Stealer of Children,</HI> I must have acknowledged it
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>to have been abominable, for of all theft, the stealing of a Child is the great∣est, nothing being so dear in the world to Parents as their Children, and I bless God, in my whole life, I never sent over Sea, Man, Woman, or Child, without their <HI>free consent.</HI> The matter of Fact in truth (for which I am now troubled) is this: In March last was two years, I sent several workmen, as <HI>Carpenters</HI> and others upon wages to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> we came down to take water at <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> but the Tide was not ready, I had besides my workmen a boy bound to me by Justice <HI>Dashwood</HI> of <HI>Hackney,</HI> to send to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> being a poor boy he had kept; I had also with me a boy of Mr. <HI>Alexander Hoseas,</HI> bound to him by his friends, to go to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> We went into an house, to stay till the Tide was ready, and bought some Pipes, Tobacco and Brandy, to take with us in the boat, we had not been long in the house, but (as boys use to do, who cannot sit long in a place) the two boys went out to play upon the Key or Wharf, they had not been there long, but another boy, one <HI>Richard Ceviter,</HI> as he said his name was, came to them, and discoursing together, the said <HI>Civiter</HI> understanding they were going to Sea, told them he would go too, whereupon the boys came and told me, there was a boy would go to Sea with them, I bid them bring him in, whereupon he came, when I saw him, I told him <HI>I</HI> supposed he was some mans <HI>Son,</HI> or <HI>Servant,</HI> therefore would not meddle with him, and bid him go and mind his Fathers or Masters business, he replied to me, <HI>He had neither Father, Mother, nor Master, nor any friend</HI> he knew of, where he might have Bread; yet <HI>I</HI> was not satisfied, but bid him begon, <HI>I</HI> would not meddle with him, so he went out, and the boys also, and <HI>I</HI> thought I was quit of him, but the two other boys went in∣to my boat, and this <HI>Civiter</HI> also, unknown to me, went with them, when the <HI>Tide</HI> was ready, the water-men called us to go, and when we came into the boat and found there also <HI>Civiter,</HI> I bid him be gon out, for <HI>I</HI> would have nothing to do with him, but he prayed me for Gods sake, and Cryed and Roared, and unless <HI>I</HI> would have turned him out by Head and Shoulders, he would not go; whereupon <HI>One</HI> from the Key side, as <HI>I</HI> suppose seing the bu∣stle in the Boat to get the boy out, called to me and told me, if <HI>I</HI> took the boy <HI>I</HI> should do a <HI>Charitable deed,</HI> for that he had been a little before <HI>pilfering of Sugar</HI> upon the Key, and might come to the <HI>Gallows</HI> if he stayed here, but might make an honest man if he went beyond Sea; upon this, &amp; the water-mans saying it would be no harm to carry him to <HI>Graves-end; I</HI> was contented; but all the way as we went <HI>I</HI> used my best understanding in his examining that if possible <HI>I</HI> could find him <HI>vary</HI> from his first story, but <HI>I</HI> see he still held in one tale, only made this addition, that his Father and Mother were dead, and that there was much Rent owing to the Landlord, and he came and seiz∣ed the Goods for Rent, and turned him out of Doors, and he had no place to go to, so was forced to wander about.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Graves-end,</HI> I was not satisfied, but had the boy before the Mayor, who examined him as I had done before; and he kept still in his old Tale; for if the Mayor could have found out from him any <HI>Parents</HI> or place of aboad, he would undoubtedly, as the Law directs, have given him Cor∣rection, and sent him back with his <HI>Pass,</HI> but seeing he could find no Parents nor place to send him to; he asked him then, what he would do, he said <HI>he would go to Sea,</HI> and said if this Gentleman (meaning me) would not take him he would go with any that would, and if he could not go in this Ship, he
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>would go in some other; the Mayor seeing the case so plain, that the boy was in distress; then asked if I was willing to take him, I told him I would, hop∣ing he might make and honest man; the Mayor in an Indenture bound him to me, his Clark being an Attorney, drew the Indentures; the which were Signed and Sealed interchangeably, between the boy and me; the Mayor and his Clark, with the <HI>Kings Searcher</HI> being witnesses, and the Boys Indenture being kept for the Boy in the Mayor's Hand; the Law as, <HI>I</HI> take it, putteth the Magistrate to stand in the room of Parents, to poor Children they put out, having no Parents of their own, as this Boy always from first to last denied he had any.</P>
<P>After this was done, I sent the Boy in our Ship the <HI>Granado</HI> to <HI>Jamaica</HI> to my Plantation, where for ought I know he is well, unless he be put an <HI>Appren∣tice</HI> to a Carpenter, or Joyner, as I think some of our last Letters have hin∣ted.</P>
<P>Thus as brief as I can, <HI>I</HI> have given you the true matter of Fact, and all that then appeared to me, how and in what manner the Boy came to me, and how disposed of; so <HI>I</HI> wished them a good Voyage; and all my expe∣ctation and hope in this boy, was that God might make him an honest man, and when God blessed him to be for himself, he might remember that God had raised him a friend here, to take that care of him, and provide for him, being then taken by me to be Fatherless, Motherless, Friendless, and help∣less, and as the boy often said his condition was such, or else I had never medled with him; for it is well known to most Merchants, that its no <HI>gain,</HI> but commonly and mostly <HI>loss,</HI> for any man to send over any Boys, Girls, or Women to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that <HI>I</HI> had very good Witnesses to prove at this ve∣ry time, and in this Ship there were two boys bigger then <HI>Civiter,</HI> and by consent of their friends sent, who well <HI>cloathed</HI> them, and besides gave Mo∣ney to the Merchants to send them to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to be imployed in Plantations, and I dare be bold to say, that to this time neither Planter nor Merchant to the said <HI>Island</HI> will take any such boy <HI>without Money,</HI> for they are at con∣siderable charge of keeping, and are of little use for some years; and indeed were there safety to the Planter and the Island; <HI>I</HI> am sure the fewer <HI>white</HI> ser∣vants any Planter has, the more it would be for his profit: but there ha∣ving been some disturbance by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and the Government finding it might be of dangerous consequence, therefore made an Act for the future, every Plantation should have one <HI>White</HI> servant, to every ten <HI>Blacks,</HI> being intended only for the <HI>security</HI> of the Island, and it is not the profit as I said be∣fore, but an Increase of charges to the Planters; what profit there is, comes out of the labour of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> who have little more for their food, then the Earth produceth, and indeed that is very good, it producing several good <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Roots,</HI> and having many good green Pease, for many Months in the year; sometimes if the Master of the Plantation be <HI>good natured</HI> and kind, he will allow his <HI>Blacks</HI> salt Fish or Flesh once a week, and with this they are for the most part well contented and very thankful, acknowledging they live better there then they did in their own Country from whence they came, and yet the great labour of all the Plantation is done by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> the <HI>Whites</HI> business being chiefly to overlook the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and to keep them in awe. <HI>I</HI> dare boldly say no <HI>White</HI> servant in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> works near so hard as many of our Husbandmen in this Country, or doth much more then half the work
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>of a <HI>Black,</HI> and yet is more chargeable in keeping then five <HI>Blacks,</HI> and this argument alone is enough to satisfie any man, that no Planter in his wits will keep more <HI>White</HI> servants than the <HI>Law</HI> of the Country commands him, but less if he could; I have already given you the food of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> which is all their charge, only once a year so much <HI>Blew Linnen,</HI> as will cover their Nakedness, and a knit Cap of about eight pence a piece; now the Charges of every White Servant is as followeth, every year <HI>new Clad</HI> from top to toe, besides recruits within the year, of Shoos, Stockings, and Shirts and other things, and for their dyet, not only all that the earth produces as the Blacks have, but over and above by act of the Country, as <HI>I</HI> am informed is allowed seven pound weight of <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Fish</HI> every week, which is a pound a day; now with good Fruits and Roots, and the bread of the Country, which is ve∣ry good, for I heard Sir <HI>Thomas Muddiford</HI> when living here, say he had rather eat it then ours here, this <HI>I</HI> say with a pound of Fish or Flesh a day, <HI>I</HI> suppose will not be accounted by any reasonable man a short <HI>Commons,</HI> and if this be not duly allowed them, the servants upon complaint to a Justice of the Peace, shall be immediately relieved, and the Planter severely chekt. Now by all this, let every man judge whether white Servants are hardly dealt with, during their Term there, and when they come out of their times, they have a portion of ground allotted them where they may plant them∣selves, and if careful and diligent with Gods blessing, may live very comfor∣tably and well: <HI>I</HI> have known some my self that have gone over in a low condition, yet now have arrived to Estates of above <HI>One thousand pound Sterling, per annum,</HI> and these are Planters; though now the price of Sugar being very low, the Planter hath not that encouragement as for∣merly.</P>
<P>And now having given you an account of the care taken for the body of every white servant, shall give you some account of what provision is made for his <HI>soul</HI> also; by an Act of the Country, every Parish in the Island is to allow to their Parish Minister, 100 l. Sterling <HI>per annum,</HI> and besides there is many <HI>good Gifts,</HI> and if there be not a good Minister in every Parish, it is not the fault of the Government, for they are willing to give good encou∣ragement for good men to come to them, I wish every Parish in <HI>England</HI> were able to allow every good Preaching Minister 100 <HI>l. per annum;</HI> but this is a digression. Now to return to my first intended design to lay open before you, what farther Circumstances hath come to the knowledg of me, since my sending the boy away, as aforesaid: About a year and aquarter after the boy was sent, comes a Gentleman to me, and tells me there was one <HI>Ci∣viter</HI> a <HI>Barber</HI> in <HI>Wapping</HI> had his Son sent over to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and he had heard that <HI>I</HI> sent him, and therefore required <HI>I</HI> would make him satisfaction, <HI>I</HI> asked him what <HI>Civiter</HI> was? he told me he was a poor man, and he heard <HI>I</HI> was rich, therefore he expected Money from me; for that his Son was a <HI>Loss</HI> to him he being helpful to him in his Trade, upon this <HI>I</HI> told him the matter and manner of Fact in sending the Boy as is before recited, and that it was strange he should pretend to be his Father, when the Boy denyed he had <HI>Any</HI> living; Also <HI>I</HI> told him I had done nothing but what was fair, and should be content any one should do the same by <HI>mine,</HI> should God bring them in the same Case, as the Boy persisted he was in, as being Fatherless, Mother∣less, friendless, penniless and helpless, and this believed by me: and farther,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/><HI>I</HI> said to him, if this <HI>Civiter</HI> had a Son run away from him that was any wise serviceable to him, and he had any Love for him, <HI>I</HI> wondred he did not lock out for him, long before this time; the Gentleman said he would not have looked after him <HI>now,</HI> but in hopes to get a piece of <HI>Mony,</HI> for saith he, <HI>I</HI> have heard the Boy had been <HI>very unlucky,</HI> and run away from divers places and would never come to good here, and therefore hearing how <HI>I</HI> had dispo∣sed him and the manner of the Boys going, he said he was well satisfyed, that he was better disposed then the parents could have done for him, therefore he vvould acquaint them vvith it, and meddle no more in it, so <HI>I</HI> heard no more of them, until about <HI>Three Months</HI> ago, and then one Mr. <HI>Grote,</HI> a Solli∣citor, being Neighbour to this <HI>Civiter,</HI> and had lent him some Money; and <HI>Civiter</HI> being <HI>poor</HI> and not able to pay him, the said <HI>Civiter</HI> told him of this business, and said, <HI>if he would follow it, he might get as much Money as would pay himself;</HI> upon vvhich Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> came to me, bringing with him <HI>Civiter</HI> and his Wife, who I had never seen before to my Knowledg, and Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> charges me, <HI>how I had sent away a Boy one</HI> Civiter <HI>about two years ago to</HI> Jamaica, <HI>which Boy was their Boy, and therefore they expected</HI> satisfaction should be made <HI>for the same,</HI> whereupon I replyed, <HI>Surely the Boy I sent, could not be theirs, for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st dfast∣ly affirmed to the last, he had neither Father or Mother, and I perceived here he had brought both;</HI> whereupon little more passed at this time farther, then giving them a <HI>Glass of Wine</HI> I being in a Tavern at Dinner; not many days after Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> came to me very civilly, and tells me, <HI>I must do something in this busi∣ness about the Boy,</HI> I told him, <HI>I would do any thing that was reasonable, but I knew no Reason I had to do any thing,</HI> whereupon, saith he, <HI>will you go before my Lord Mayor, and leave it to Him,</HI> I told him, <HI>I would very readily,</HI> then Sir, saith he, <HI>I shall not trouble you with a</HI> Summons, but pray please to <HI>Appear such a day and hour;</HI> Accordingly <HI>I</HI> attended, where soon after I saw Capt. <HI>Sam. Jones,</HI> who had been Commander of the Ship, at the time when the Boy was sent, whom they had summoned in; when my Lord Mayor was ready, we were called before him, there appeared against me that <HI>I</HI> knew again Mr. <HI>Groat</HI> and <HI>Civiters</HI> Wife they telling my Lord, how their Boy vvas lost, and how <HI>I</HI> had taken him up, and Capt. <HI>Jones</HI> had carried him <HI>away;</HI> my Lord asked, vvhat <HI>I</HI> said to it; <HI>I</HI> said, my Lord, <HI>I own such a Boy by name,</HI> and gave my Lord Account as to the Matter and Mannea of Fact, as before is recited, my Lord turning to them, said, <HI>what would you have,</HI> they Answer'd, <HI>Their Boy again, I</HI> replyed, <HI>The Boy sought me, not I him,</HI> and indeed by his pittiful Complaints, prevailed with me to take him, or else I should not have done it, whereupon one Mr. <HI>Rainsford Waterhouse,</HI> a Man of known Repute and Estate, said my Lord, I <HI>wonder at the Ingratitude of these People, and what they would have, they ought to give Mr.</HI> Wil∣mer <HI>Thanks for doing so well by the boy, who is better provided for then they could do, for they are so Poor, that the Parish doth daily Expect, when they will come upon their Charges, I</HI> knew not one Word of Mr. <HI>VVaterhouse</HI>'s being there, un∣til <HI>I</HI> heard him speak, when he had done, saith my Lord, <HI>Look, you here, why do you come with Complaints when you ought to give thanks to God and Mr.</HI> Wilmer <HI>for doing so well by the Boy;</HI> upon which speaks one Mr. <HI>Vavasor</HI> vvho vvas all this vvhile a Spectator and no vvays concerned in it, or made acquainted with it, as <HI>I</HI> shall prove in due time, and that <HI>Civiters</HI> Wife had never seen <HI>Vavasor</HI> in her Life before to her Knowledg, but he then spake and used many words to little purpose, that to me his Lordships patience seemed very great to suf∣fer

<P>But the next, or at most two days after came Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> to me and told me, <HI>He was very sorry things w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re carried so high by Vavasor,</HI> and that he should <HI>thrust himself into this business being altogether a Stranger to</HI> Civiter, <HI>and she had never seen him in her Life before,</HI> and then when <HI>Civiters</HI> Wife came home her Husband vvas angry at vvhat she had done, telling her, <HI>He had, and that she knew well, given full Power by Letter of Attorney to Mr</HI> Grote <HI>to prosecute, or make an end, as he saw good, and to none else;</HI> which <HI>Letter of Attorney</HI> Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> shew∣ed me; where <HI>I</HI> saw <HI>Richard Civiter</HI> by his Mark, which mark <HI>I</HI> have forgot, but saith Mr. <HI>Grote, If you please to put the Business to Arbitration I am willing, I</HI> replyed, <HI>I was for my part willing also to leave it to any man, that he should name
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>that had the Reputation of an Honest Man;</HI> but I said, <HI>If it be put to Arbitration, Civiter and his Wife shall with me enter into Bond to stand to the Award:</HI> Accordingly next day he brought up <HI>Civiter</HI> and his Wife to enter into Bonds with me: I being at dinner Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> came up and dined with me; there was also at Dinner One Mr. <HI>Fal∣coner</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dodsworth</HI> with some others; I heard <HI>Civiter</HI> and his Wife was below, I sent them down some Victuals, and ordered them a Pint of Wine, and whilst we sat at Dinner Mr. <HI>Grote</HI> chose Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> and I chose Mr. <HI>Dodsworth,</HI> and as soon as we had dined sent for a Scrivener, who drew up Bonds of One hundred pounds penalty each to other to stand to the Award of the said Ar∣bitrators, and if they did not make an end of it, then to such Um∣pine they should choose; the Arbitrators withdrew and consult∣ed; but in the mean time Mr. <HI>Vavasor</HI> had been at <HI>Civiters</HI> house, but finding them not at home, hunted out after them, and found them out with me; and came into my room with a lame excuse, and asked if I were not at his house to speak with him; I told him no, nor knew of any house he had; if he had, knew not where it was, he replied he thought it had been me, for his Wife told him there had been a Gentleman on horse back at his house, and said his name was <HI>Wilmore,</HI> and would needs speak with her Hus∣band; now Note, I had not been on horse-back for above six Moneths before that time; but he thought that forged story would seem the better, if he said, I were on horseback, because he heard I was most at <HI>Hackney,</HI> and came to Town every morning, but I perceived his business was to speak with <HI>Civiter</HI> and his wife, and thereupon he spake to them and asked the reason of their be∣ing here, they told him what they had done, at which he storm∣ed and made a very great disturbance in the house by his <HI>hector∣ing;</HI> upon which I bid him depart my room, and not come there with his flams to make disturbances, I knew of no business he had; and with much ado got him out of the house; when gone, <HI>Civiter</HI> and his wife were very civil, and seemed not to like <HI>Vava∣sor,</HI> and that they were well enough satisfied with the boys being where he was, but thought it was reason they should have Money, because they was told I had sent him without Law; but hovvever (said they) vve are content to take vvhat the Gentlemen Arbitra∣tors give us, about this time the Arbitrators broke off for the pre∣sent,
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>and appointed to meet at the same house the next day at Dinner, and then to discourse and make an end if they could; by this means Mr. <HI>Vavasor</HI> fearing his time would be lost, gets his Assistant, one <HI>Carleton Beamont</HI> to go with him near <HI>Civiters</HI> house, where sending for them, he gives them plenty of liquor, and treats them high, and tells them they were worse then mad, if they made an end with <HI>Wilmore,</HI> for as for money he would help them to a great deal more, than ever they could expect of <HI>Wilmore</HI> by Arbitration, nay hundreds of pounds and more, as I shall by witness be able to prove, and farther said <HI>Vavasor, this Dog Wilmore, this Ignoramus Dog,</HI> if I do but rout him, I shall be made the <HI>Kings Attorney,</HI> this I am credibly informed he had the impudence to say, and I shall, I question not, prove it when oc∣casion offers.</P>
<P>These Fellows talking at this High Rate of such Great sums of money, the poor people dream't of nothing but Moun∣tains of Gold and Silver; though as is verily believed never saw five pound of their own together in their lives; but being then pretty high in drink, they fell a rayling at Mr. <HI>Groat,</HI> telling him he drew them in to Seal a Bond of Arbitration, and had betrayed them, therefore they would go to their Arbitrator and order him not to make an end by any means; Mr. <HI>Groat</HI> here∣upon seeing their fickleness, and charging him of betraying them; said he would meddle no more in it, and by his good will the Arbitrator should make no end if he could help it.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<P>Next day according to appointment the Arbitrators met, and Mr. <HI>Groat</HI> comes and tells them what was done, and prays Mr. <HI>Fal∣coner</HI> to leave the business as he found it, for he was accounted a Rogue, Rascal, and Cheat, and therefore should have a wea∣ry life with the <HI>Civiters,</HI> being foul tongued people, and his Neigh∣bours therefore prayed him again to make an end; but Mr. <HI>Falconer</HI> replyed, Sir I hope you did not choose me for your fool, therefore I shall make an end of it if I can with this Gen∣tleman Mr. <HI>Dodsworth,</HI> for I find him an Honest and Judicious man, upon this Mr <HI>Groat</HI> and I left the Arbitrators to themselves and went into another room, where Mr. <HI>Groat</HI> told me what had passed down by <HI>Civiters,</HI> and by means of this <HI>Vavasors</HI> wheedling them with such great promises, that he should have no quiet of his life, for <HI>Vavasor</HI> did continually ply them so close, that his Tale could not be heard with them; for (says he) <HI>Va∣vasor</HI> spends Money upon them, and treats them at such an extra∣vagant Rate, That I cannot but wonder at the Meaning of it, and talks to them of such great Sums of Money, he will get them, as makes the poor People almost mad. By this time the Arbitrators brake up, and told us, They as then could not agree, but would farther consider of it until the Morrow, if then they could not agree, would give it up to the Umpire, which they had agreed on, which was one Mr. <HI>Atwood;</HI> And so They Appointed to meet at the Ship-Tavern in <HI>Bartholemew.</HI> Lane, but before they parted Mr. <HI>Dodsworth</HI> told me, though I had not Limited Him, and he saw no Reason I should give a penny yet for Peace sake, he had consented to give Five Pounds; In regard the Charge would be as much to me, if not more if I brought the Boy back: Though He saw no Reason I should do that, if the Boy went willingly, and was bound by In∣denture: I said He was, and the other Gentleman said the same, if I could but shew the Indenture, He would be sa∣tisfied; But, saith He, I have but your Word, That he was so Bound, and They say, He was not, Novv vvhich shall I Be∣lieve.</P>
<P>I said, Sir! as you are a Merchant, must needs know the custom of Merchants, that when Servants for Plantations are bound; the In∣denture
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>they sign to, is always sent with them to satisfie the Govern∣ment, and the Persons they are sent to, that thereby they may see when their time is expired, that then they may have their freedom; and for the other Indenture, the party bound takes it in his custody, that by it, when his time is out he may demand his freedom, unless there be Parents appear, then they many times take the Indentures of the Lads, signed by his Master, to keep for him least he lose it: And Sir, the witnesses live as far as <HI>Graves-end,</HI> and its impossible for me to send to them to have an Attest within the compass of your time, but Sir, let that proof rest on me, and make an end with that <HI>proviso</HI> that I prove the Indenture; Sir saith he, that will be intricate to draw, and the Umpier we have agreed on is an honest man; and you may get your Attest of the Indenture time enough to shew him, and I am sure that will satisfie him; and when Mr. <HI>Dodsworth</HI> and I go to him, to give him account how we have proceeded, we will both tell him our judgments; if you prove the Indenture and the willingness of the boy to go, we think it no reason for you to give a farthing; but however, Sir, saith he, Mr. <HI>Dodsworth</HI> hath told you what he hath offered to give: And I will tell you what I offered to take Thirty pounds, nay Twenty five pounds to put an end to it: And I confess I have no other reason, but the <HI>People are poor,</HI> and I am not certain of the Indenture: Nay, Sir, said I, <HI>If that be all, I can go, or send my Man twenty Times to Gravesend for less Money than Twenty pounds,</HI> therefore pray ye Gentlemen, both together, when you de∣liver up your Trust to Mr. <HI>Atwood;</HI> tell Him your Judgments, and what only differed, and by that time Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> hath it from you: My Man shall bring from <HI>Gravesend</HI> an Attest of the Indenture, and the Boys willingness to go; And I shall confide in Mr. <HI>Atwood's</HI> Rea∣diness to put an End to this Branglement: Upon this We parted, and I sent my Man to <HI>Gravesend</HI> to Mr. <HI>Walter Nynn</HI> to enquire of him what he could remember in this Matter, upon which after a little pause, saith he, <HI>I Remember the Thing very well, and have the Boys In∣denture by me, that was signed by your Master, I will fetch it,</HI> which he did, and my Man took a Copy of it, and compared it, that so he might make Oath it was, <HI>A true Copy,</HI> if need be, thus far my Man having proceeded; the next thing was to the willingness of the BOY: Sir, Do you Remember any Passages or Circum∣stances as to that? Mr. <HI>Nynn</HI> Replyed, That He believed,
<PB N="11" REF="7"/><HI>He examined him near an hour, and, That he deny'd he had either Father or Mother, or any place of abode, and That he was resolved to go to Sea, either for your Master or any one that would have him. And therefore seeing the boy in Distress, and your Master willing to take him, I thought it my Duty, at least no Crime, to provide an honest Master for a poor Boy, and so I did bind him.</HI> My man hearing Mr. <HI>Ninn</HI> express himself thus freely, saw it was full to the purpose for which he was sent: yet asked Mr. <HI>Nyon</HI> for Mr. <HI>Cresswell</HI> the Searcher: He said he was <HI>Dead.</HI> Upon that my Man rested, relying he had enough to satisfy Mr. <HI>Atwood:</HI> he comes back and gives Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> an Account: and Mr. <HI>Dodsworth</HI> delivers him over the Power of Umpire, and satisfies him where Only the Let was; Mr. <HI>Folkoner</HI> only wrote to him, as I think. But whether the Woman, by <HI>Vavaosor</HI> Instigation, disturb'd him, or what else, I know not: He left the Business as he found it, saying, He was near 80 years of Age, and, he did not love to meddle with any Business: so the time was elapsed, and no more to be done untill the Sessions which was near. My next work was to Enquire, what Mr. <HI>Vaveser</HI> was? I quickly heard enough of him: Amongst other things, I shall only Instance This, He hath been a great In∣former and an unnatural one, for, 'tis reported, He informed against his Father in Law, Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> a Rope-maker well known to be of an Estate, and an honest man: I think he was forc'd to pay 200 l. or a considerable summ upon his Son's Information against his Father, for going to Meetings. And by this time the Sessions of Feace brings me to appear at <HI>Guild Hall,</HI> where I found Mr. <HI>Vaveser,</HI> and as an Assistant to him, one Mr. <HI>Carleton Beaumont, Civiter</HI> and his VVise, with some Others they had got, who were very bu∣sy in preparing a BILL to present before the Grand Jury: VVhich done, after the Examining what VVitnesses they then had, did upon their Serious weighing it, do me that Justice and Right, as to bring in the Bill <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> Upon which <HI>Vavesor</HI> was so impertinent, as to say, They had more Witnes∣ses, therefore desired the Court, the Jury might go out again: Which was granted: And upon Examining the other Witness, the Jury was farther confirmd in their first Verdict, and accordingly gave it in. Upon this <HI>Vavesor</HI> had further Confidence to move the Court, That their VVitnesses might be examined in Open Court: which was rejected. He was in a ve∣ry great Rage, and his Assistant <HI>Beaumont</HI> was transported with Passion, say∣ing, Altho an <HI>Ignoramus</HI> was brought in here, yet he would put in an <HI>Infor∣mation</HI> in the Crown-Office against me, and lay it in KENT, for that he would <HI>Colledg me</HI> or serve me as Colledg was serv'd, before he had done with me, and bid me prepare for it: And truly, I verily believe the man spake what was in his Heart, That if such as he could get JURIES to their Minds, they would not only hang me up, but Thousands more, like Ropes of Onions. And for a farther Account of this Mr. <HI>Carlton Beamont,</HI> I re∣fer you to Mr. <HI>Elkana Settle,</HI> who among many others can give you one Prank of his, at whose Mercy <HI>Beamont</HI> did lye: there was a Record rased by somebody, I suppose Mr. <HI>Settle</HI> may more certainly inform you: since my Retirement, I have not had Opportunity to make Inquiry into Particulars; But both <HI>Vaveser</HI> and <HI>Beaumont</HI> by Common Fame are notoriously known. Now I thought my self at rest for some time, but my Enemys meant no such Thing, for quickly was I served with an old Obsolete Writ, that is scarce in a King's Reign made use of, called <HI>De homine Replegiando;</HI> which
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>was made returnable <HI>immediate</HI> or immediately. I told Mr. <HI>Beaumont</HI> and the Clark-sitter one under Mr. <HI>Trotman</HI> Secondary or Deputy Sheriff, at the Pol∣try Counter, That I did not understand the meaning of it, but I would im∣mediately advise with Councel, and accordingly would put in my Return: And I very happily met with Councell in the same House, to whom I shew'd the Writ, and stated my Case: he said, He would look it over, and draw up a Return: But before Councel could draw it up. I was next day serv'd with an <HI>Alias,</HI> returnable also <HI>immediate,</HI> being of the Tenor of the Former: and the next day was served with a <HI>Pluries.</HI> By this time, my Councel had finished the Return, which, by good Witness, was carried to the Poul∣try Counter, drawn by him in Latin: Therefore for the more Common Understanding thereof, I give it with the <HI>Pluries</HI> in English; for our Com∣monalty generally as yet, do not understand either <HI>Latin Prayers,</HI> or Court-Hand <HI>Latin Writs.</HI></P>

<P>Whereupon I was ordered to plead <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> I replyed, That if by the Legal Course of that Court, I ought so to do; I was ready to do it: But withal told my Lord Chief Justice, I was sorry that Great Court should be troubled with so <HI>Trivial</HI> a Thing wherein was more of <HI>Malice</HI> than any thing else, for that one <HI>Carlton Beaumont</HI> one of the busiest in Prosecution had threatned to <HI>Colledg</HI> me before he had done with me. My Lord com∣manded the Tip-staff to take me into Custody. If I did not <HI>immediately</HI> plead; Whereupon I pleaded <HI>NOT GUILTY:</HI> Upon which my Lord ordered a Tryal at Bar of that Court: And, as I told you in the Introduction, I shall not meddle with any thing done by that Court in my Tryal, being a <HI>Noli me Tangere;</HI> yet I hope, without Offence, to Justice, in defence of my self I may touch upon the Material Witnesses there produced against me: one, was <HI>Civiters</HI> wife, who swore several things against me: as my Discourse and Demands at my Lord Mayor's; That there I demanded what Money I had disbursed in the Boy's Passage <HI>outwards,</HI> and likewise what his <HI>Re-passage</HI> would cost: when as its notoriously known by many good Citizens, That those things are notoriously false; for that my Offers were as are formerly exprest. Another Witness brought against me was <HI>their Waterman</HI> who swore, He carried us down to <HI>Graves End:</HI> which is also notoriously false.</P>
<P>Now, That the Waterman <HI>We</HI> produced was the <HI>Right-man</HI> that carried us, I shall make out by such a Corroborating Circumstance as shall satisfie all unbyassed persons, tho, many will say, Its hard to find a Waterman after 2 years, that but once carried one by Water, or that never saw the man before or since; but take the Circumstances, and then Judge. As we went to <HI>Graves-End,</HI> Some Discourse between one another will be, to pass away the
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>time; and amongst other Discourse, our Waterman told us, That year a Gen∣tleman (as I understand, had some time before) gave a <HI>Boat</HI> to be towed for, by several Watermen, and he that came first to the place appointed, should have it: our Waterman said, He got the Boat that year: By this Token ma∣ny of <HI>Billings-gate</HI> watermen told us his Name, and so we found him our, or else among the Thousands it had been Impossible: Therefore whereas the <HI>Popish Scriblers</HI> have charged me with <HI>Subornation,</HI> and my Witnesses with Per∣jury. I doubt not by unquestionable Testimony of good Citizens, and others of Repute, to make out Both against some of their Witnesses, with <HI>Vavesor</HI> and <HI>Beaumont.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I given you, at large, the most material Things done by my self in sending over the Boy: and also the most remarkable Occurrences done or said by others, from the beginning of the Prosecution, to the Tryal at <HI>West∣minster.</HI> (Where, by the way, Note, I had above 20 Witnesses of good Re∣pute, whereof one half of them (as I am Inform'd) was not sworn, nor se∣veral of those that were, ever so much as heard: I had six Councels, judg'd as able as most as plead at that Bar, who did speak little: the Reason of both I leave to indifferent and unbiassed men to judge, when the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of my Case was as before is stated and would have been fully prov'd) having done what I promised in the Beginning, I leave my self to the Judg∣ment of God and men, whether <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty</HI> of the Information: When some of the July confessed, They had many times done the same thing, and had not near so much to say for themselves as I have, and yet thought it no Crime in them. But some may say, <HI>Every one</HI> is not <HI>John Will∣mer,</HI> and, That <HI>same may better steal an Horse, than another look over the Hedg:</HI> But (to requite Proverb with Proverb) that which is <HI>Sauce for a Goose to day may be for a Gander to morrow.</HI> Therefore if Judgment be of <HI>Parties</HI> and not of <HI>Causes,</HI> I am sure no Peace can be in that at long Runn, when the Judge of Judges shall sit on his Throne, and pass Judgment upon all men according to what they have done here. That which I am more concern'd at than at my own <HI>Private Troubles,</HI> is to see the Unconcernedness of our <HI>Protestants</HI> one for another, and that there should be such Divisions amongs US at this day, when the Common Enemy, the PAPISTS, unite in Councils and Pur∣ses for the Good of their whole Party. [<HI>Witness</HI> Thompson <HI>about</HI> Godfrey] When as but one little <HI>Rat</HI> of their Tribe shall stare the Government in the Face, and give them the <HI>Lye,</HI> and tell them, he will shew them a Reason for it too, if you question him; Rather than he shall want help, their Capt. <HI>General</HI> shall interpose for him: How then should this teach Protestants more Witt and Policy; If <HI>Religion</HI> will not, I am sure their Secular Interest should: But some say, Wit is ne'er good till 'tis bought, I wish you'd have a Care, you do'nt pay too Dear for't. Therefore my Brethren and Fellow Citizens, Take care in the Choise of <HI>Good Sheriffs,</HI> and by Law advise and take Counsel to∣gether, all you that are concern'd to look after the CHARTER of the City, which is granted to every individual Freeman, and confirm'd by Divers Acts of Parliament, and is as much their own, as my Land of Inheritance is mine, which cannot be forfeited but for Treason: And, I bless God, THAT I am free from, unless false Witnesses prevail. And I am satisfied, That as the City was miraculously burnt by the hands of Papists, so it was miraculously
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>built by the Hand of GOD to do some Miraculous Work against the PA∣PISTS, and in no long time. And I dare be bold to say, If the CHARTER of the City of LONDON be not good, that no Charter of any City or Town Corporate in <HI>England</HI> is: Therefore, Take Care in Time, lest you all Repent when 'tis too late. But 'tis time for me to have done with this Sub∣ject, Lest the <HI>Observator</HI> say, Here is a Treasonable <HI>Association</HI> (for I fear me according to his Doctrine, It may be such for a man and his Wife to love one-another, or a Woman to teach her Child to read the Bible 'ere long) and if it should be made out, 'twould be worse then <HI>Kidnapping:</HI> for, I know to my Cost what 'tis to be in the Tower, though that's Honorable, yet its dear, and I love not to pay too dear for my Honor: Yet my Love to all Protest∣ants in general is so great, That I would suffer much for them, rather than by Timerousness stoop to any thing that is Base, or should do the least of them any harm. Have Charity and Love one to and for another, lest you be beaten to it at last. Look up, Protestants, and unite to serve God, honor the King, and meddle not with them that are given to Changes, and strive only to serve one another in Love for the good of the Whole; and be not di∣vided by the Subtilty of the Devil, Jesuites, or any base carnal Interest: and then you need not fear but you will finde [mark <HI>Heraclitus</HI> Num. 71] Cats enough in <HI>England,</HI> for all the Romish Rats and Mice that seek to de∣vour us, for the Great JEHOVAH is for us, Therefore shall all our Enemys be <HI>Scattered.</HI></P>
