<HEAD>Two great and desperate Engagements, both by Sea and Land: the first be∣tween the English frigats, commanded by Cap. Foster Cap. Benjamin, and Ca. George Cracknel, and the K. of Scots men of War, commanded by Vice-ad∣miral Bannister. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the 8 of this instant July, 1654. divers of the English Frigats having been upon the Coast of Dunkirk, to convoy a fleet of Merchant-men; upon their return to∣wards the Narrow, they espyed the King of Scots fleet, unto whom they gave chace; and at last com∣within shot, saluted them with several broad sides; Vice-admiral Bannister being in the Eagle, answerd them again; but after a sharp dispute, finding the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Arguments too high to dispense withall from the mouthe of the English Canon, he tacked about, for Calis, and got under the command of the Roy∣all Fort, where he presently hung forth a Flag of defiance; which Captain Benjamin Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heverel per∣ceiving, attempted with the Eagle to strand him; but the great Canon from the Fort and Blockhou∣ses played so ast upon him, that he was constrained to come off by the Leeward, his design proving unfeasible. However upon their putting forth to the main Ocean, they espyed another fleet, which proved French-men, and after 4 or 5 leagues chace, sank one, and took another, without the loss of one man. We have also taken their Newfound land fleet, and divers ships coming from Malaga, which adds far more Tryumphant Victories, when we fought the Royal Navy took their Admiral, and di∣vers others, and totally dissipated the whole Fleet; which heroick Atchievment, deserves to be eter∣niz'd, with these Lines, in Letters of Gold.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>From <HI>Scotland</HI> further thus: The Ministers still preach up young Charles their King, and pray for him as <HI>Gods Vice ge∣rent</HI> on earth. Their forces are endeavouring a conjunction, and the North Countrey are generally disaffected, murthering the English privately; but a party coming from Ayr, commanded by Quartermaster Stevenson, being pursued by a strong party of the enemy, faced about, drew up and ingaged them; and after a very sharp and desperate dispute, took one Captain, a Cornet, and 11
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>others, killed one Capt. Armstrong, divers others, and wounded many; but this Atchievment was not obtained without some blood, noses, and broken pates; for one of our men was cut in the head, another had his nose slit, and some others were let blood in their arms, ond other places.</P>

<P>But that which appeares more dreadful unto us, is, the enemies falling upon the a∣foresaid Col. Bryans men, the manner thus: A party of 120 men being drawn out to get off boats from the enemy; they being too eager of their prey, and withal careless, and not keeping together, nor observing command, Sir George Monro lying in Ambuscado, fel upon them, and kiled four∣score galant men, where of some Officers, &amp; quite frustrated us of our design. Yet other Letters say to the contrary, and that the English hath given the Scots a defeat. The truth whereof seemes too dubious at pre∣sent, by reason, that the enemy are numer∣ous, and have the disadvantage amongst the
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>Hils, the Weather being so extream cold, that we are scarce able to indure the field; besides, we have a perfect Winter in this cold Angle of the World, having not any thing but nipping Frosts, and tempestuous storms, so that we are exposed to abun∣dance of danger and difficulties, and invol∣ved in a Labyrinth of troubles; but We doubt not, but that Hand of Providence which hath hitherto preserved Us, wil in the greatest of our streights, stil preserve &amp; protect Us, and in the end crown us with those trpumphant signals, whereby God may be glorified, the Truth maintained, and the just Laws and Liberties of the peo∣ple inviolably kept and preserved.</P>
