<HEAD><HI>A True</HI> RELATION OF THE PRESENT STATE OF IRELAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Ittle Newes is to be expected, but God be blessed it is good: Eight dayes since Lord <HI>Lisle,</HI> Lord <HI>Dygbie,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Folliat</HI> went to∣wards <HI>Castle Goshel,</HI> where the Ladie <HI>Dygbie</HI> was besie∣ged by the Rebels; and Sir <HI>Charles Coot</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>accompanyed them from the <HI>Naas;</HI> they were not 500. in all that went, which Castle they relieved, hanged many of the Rogues, from thence they came to <HI>Trim,</HI> in the way tooke <HI>Phillips</HI> Towne, burnt it, and the <HI>Navan,</HI> relieved more Castles by the way, tooke <HI>Trim,</HI> and abide there still; a Garrison of a 1000. Foot, and 500, Horse will be put there. It is a Towne of great consequence, sixe Castles in it, all this while there was not 500. Men of ours, and they saw above a 1000. of the Rebels, 6.7. or 800. in a place, in some places 1500. and not daring once to oppose our men, but runne away and gaze afarre off, Deere-like; this we must not attribute to the strength of man, but <HI>God</HI> must be glorified in it.</P>
<P>Last Saturday the <HI>Newrie</HI> was taken by the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and the Scots, joyning to∣gether, without losse of one man, after they had been before it two or three dayes: for they were not willing to fight for feare of de∣stroying the English Prisoners, which the Rebels had in the Towne; at last they yeelded the Towne upon condition, what I know
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>not, and all the Prisoners are freed; the chiefe Sir <HI>Edward Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Point,</HI> Cap∣taine <HI>Smith,</HI> and many others, who have in∣dured much sorrow. Sir <HI>Con. Mac. Genis</HI> was the chiefe of the Rebels there.</P>
<P>Now God be thanked the way is cleare in a manner betwixt this and <HI>Carickfargus.</HI></P>
<P>Some came from the <HI>Newrie</HI> this day, which is 44. miles, burnt <HI>Carlingford,</HI> which is 5. miles from the <HI>Newrie,</HI> and the Rogues are beaten in all places where they are met withall.</P>
<P>If we had now Men and Money here, I verily beleeve this Summer would be an end of this Rebellion, except it be some strag∣ling Rogues in Bogges and Woods. I pray God send us good News from you, and for the present I cease.</P>
<P><HI>Sir</HI> Charles Coot <HI>was not here since he went first out, doth continue at the</HI> Naas, <HI>where he doth fortifie and make Forts, and at the first put out a Proclamation that all the Irish that were left there should depart the Towne in</HI> 24. <HI>houres, else be hanged. He hath many there at worke, Spinners, Glovers, Weavers, Knitters,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>Tanners, and all kind of Trades, and all things is plenty there, abundance of Cattill, two quarts of Milke a penny; and he makes the Souldiers worke duely, and gives them 6 pence a day for their worke, besides their pay; hangs and kills all that he meets, of the Rebels.</HI></P>
