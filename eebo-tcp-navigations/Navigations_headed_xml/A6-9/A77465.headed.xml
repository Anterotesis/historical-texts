<HEAD><HI>A BRIEF</HI> Relation of the Siege of <HI>VIENNA,</HI> And the Victory of the CHRISTIANS against the TƲRKS at BARKAN.</HEAD>
<P>THe Turks falling with their formidable Forces like a Torrent into Hungary, the Duke of Lorrain was forced to repass the River Raab, and first to bring his Army under the Walls of Altenbourg, and afterwards to cause his Infantry to pass one of the Arms of the Danube, and to post themselves in the Island Schutz, while his Highness remained with his Cavalry on this side the River, but he was quickly obliged to retire, upon the advice he had, that the Hungarians, who were appointed to guard the passage of the River Raab, had be∣trayed the same to the Enemy. His Highness marched with all the speed he could, but the Enemy followed him so close; that their foremost Troops fell upon his Rear; the skirmish was very hot, and the Imperialists suffered a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable loss: but in conclusion the Enemy were forced to retire; In this action the Prince of Savoy was mortally wounded. On the 8th of July the Duke of Lorrain arrived near this place with the Imperial Cavalry; and about nine a clock that night, their Imperial Majesties, with the Arch-Dukes, and Arch-dutchesses parted from hence in great haste for Lintz. The next day and the following great numbers of people left this place, some one way, some another; and the confusion and consternation we were here in, cannot be exprest. The Enemy in the mean time advanced into Austria, the Tartars making a most terrible ravage wherever they came; Our Governor the Count de Staremberg, who arrived here from the Army on the Eighth, being assisted by the Count de Caplieres, in quality of the Emperors Commissary General, was not wanting all this while, as well as thetime would permit, to put the place into a posture of defence, and particularly to plant Palisadoes on the Counterscharp. The 11th and 12th the Imperial Infantry making Six Regiments, entred the place, and then our Garison, with the Regiment of Staremberg of 1500 Men which was here before consisted of 14500 Foot and 1000 horse, and besides these, we counted between 12 and 15000 Burghers, Students and Servants, capable to bear Arms. The 13th we set fire to the Suburbs, in which were above 5000 Houses, and 15 or 16 stately Palaces which were all burnt with their ric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and costly Furniture. The 14th the Imperial Cavalry in E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>even Regi∣ments, Seven Regiments of Dragoons, Three of Croats, and Sixteen Troops of Polish Horse, who the day before had had some skirmishes with the Enemies Vanguard, marched trough this City, and having passed the <HI>Danube</HI> over Six or Seven Bridges, marched to Corne-Neubourg; the same day, arrived here Four large Boats with Ammunition, and several Incendiaries, who intended to fire the Magazing, and in effect, had already burnt several Houses very nea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> were discovered, and being dragged about the Streets by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People, were Fleed alive; and the Turks began to inv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the place. The 15th we were formally besieged by 150 thou¦sand fighting Men; The Grand Visier taking his Quarters in the Empress Dowagers Palace, called La Favorite. The Enemy began that very day to fire upon the place, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ned their Trenches the 16th the Enemy fired upon us from Three Batteries, and shot a great many Bombs in to the Town; they possessed themselves in the night, of Leopolstadt, and another small Isle in the <HI>Danube,</HI> by which means they likewise shut us upon that side. This day our Governor re∣ceived a small wound in the Hood with a stone, raised by a Cannon shot. The 17, 18, and 19 were spent by the Enemy in advancing their approaches to gain the Counterscarp; and on our side we made several Sallies to hinder them in their Works, the Cannon playing on both sides almost without in∣termission. In a Sally we made on the 19th we took two or three prisoners, who told us the Turks were above 100000 fighting Men, besides 20000 which still kept Raab blocked up, under the Command of two Bassa's. The 20th the Enemy had finished a Battery in Leopolstadt, from whence they like∣wise attacked us with their Cannon and Bombs. The 21 our Governor received letters from the Duke of Lorrain promi∣sing a speedy Relief. The 23 the Enemy did not make so much use of their Batteries, as they had hitherto done; but about 7 at night they sprang a Mine on each side of their chief At∣tack, which was against the Lebi Ballion, between those of Melcke and the Court, and followed them with three several Assaults in both places, but were so bravely received that they did not advance a hands breadth without very great less. The 25th they again sprang a Mine, and stormed three times, but were repulsed, though with great loss on our side. The 26th in the Evening we sprang a Mine, but it had not the effect we desired. The Enemy shot into the Town a Letter, being tied to an Arrow, which our Governor had some days before writ to the Duke of Lorrain, and this they accompa∣nied with another Paper, perswading us to save our selve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by yielding in time, and not to irritate the Grand Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> The 27th the Enemy again attacked the Counterscar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="2"/>same places where they sprang their Mine the 23 which they renewed four several times, and were as often beaten off; and thus there did not pass a day without springing of Mines on their side or ours, or without the Enemies making an Assault in one place or another. The third of August about 10 at night, they stormed the Counterscarp before the Ra∣velin of Burgshor, and after having been repulsed four se∣veral times, they lodged themselves there; that day the Enemy raised a Battery against the right face of the Burg Bastioh. The 6th the Enemy sprang several Mines, and made a descent into the Ditch, which caused a great alarm among us. The 7th we made a Sally, and killed a great many of the Enemy. On the 9th they sprang again a Mine which buried many of our Men; in the Evening we made a Sally and ruined their Works in the Ditch, but with great loss on our side. The 11th, 12th, and 13th, several Mines were sprung on both sides; The Enemy raised several new Batte∣ries, and again lodged themselves in the Ditch, and we made several Sallies. The 14th they advanced their Works in the Ditch before the Ravelin; and the night following lodged themselves on the point of the Ravelin. The 17th we Sallied out with 200 Men, and ruined their Works in the Ditch; and the next day we beat them from the point of the Ravelin; The dayes following we were in continual action with the Enemy, who had now secured their Lodgments in the Ditch: And we made several Retrenchments within the Bastions; out Garison begun to be very much weakened, we had lost a Colonel, five Lieutenant-Colonels, about 30 Captains, and 38 Lieute∣nants, and many were sick. The 2 of September the Ene∣my sprang a Mine-under the Bastion of Lebl, and blew up the point of it; and thereupon made an Assault with great numbers of men, but were repulsed. The 4th they sprang another Mine, which made a breach in the flank of the said Bastion, and they endeavoured to lodge themselves there, but were beaten off. The same day we made signe from St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Tower of the great distress we began to be in. The 5th, 6th, and 7th the Enemy made great Efforts to lodge themselves on the Lebl Bastion. The 8th we discove∣red a great Mine of the Enemies, and took the Powder out of it; and again made signs from St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Tower, for our danger began to be very great. The 9th we saw great part of the Enemies Troops decamp, and march towards <HI>Kalemberg</HI> and the <HI>Forrest,</HI> and we understood by a Priso∣ner, that they were in great consternation upon the advice they had of the approach of the Christian Army; however they continued to attack us with their Connon and Bombs as furiously as ever, and went on with their Mines under the Lebl Bastion. The 10th at night they sprang a Mine, but without any great effect. The 11th in the afternoon the whole Turkish Army marched out of their Camp towards <HI>Kalem∣berg;</HI> but at the same time the Enemy not only kept their Trenches, but continued to fire upon us from their Batte∣ries, and to work in their Mines. The 12th they made use of their Cannon and Bombs as formerly, and we expected eve∣ry minute they would spring their Mines; but about four in the Afternoon, we perceived the Enemy were in great con∣fusion, and that they began to flee, and that the Mar∣grave of Baden advanced with several Batallions to our re∣lief; upon which our Governour Sallied out, and fell upon the Turks, who were still in their Trenches, and cut them all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pieces; and about five the Marquiss de Baden entred the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the joy of the Inhabitants being equal to the trouble <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>traction they were in before. Our Garison was redu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o Men, and the Enemy had made so great a breach in the Lebl Bastion, that we had reason to fear we could not have resisted their nixt Assault: It's impossible to discribe the Enemies Works, they are incredible, in their Trenches they were covered as well from the weather as our shot; nor can we pretend to give you here an account of all remarkable passages during this famous Siege, from which it pleased the Divine Goodness, after Sixty days to deliver us. This inva∣sion of the Turks has cost the Lives of 100000 Christians, besides the great Numbers carried into Captivity, and the desolation of this once flourishing Countrey of Austria, is so great, that its Ruines cannot be repaired without many Mil∣lions, and many years.</P>
<P>The letters from the Imperial Camp near <HI>Gran,</HI> con∣firm the account we gave you in our last, brought hither by the Count <HI>de Lamberg,</HI> of the Victory which the Christians obtained against the Turk at <HI>Barkan,</HI> whereof they give us the following Relation. On the 9th Instant the Imperial and Polish Armies advanced in order of Battle, the Imperialists having the Vanguard, towards <HI>Barkan,</HI> near which place was encamped a Body of between 13 and 14000 Turks, being the best troops of their remaining Army, they, en∣couraged with the advantage they had upon the Poles on the 7th, no sooner saw the Christian Army appear, but advan∣ced with full speed, and most hideous Cries, charged the imperialists, and endeavoured to break in upon them; the Christians kept themselves very close and firm, and repul∣sed the Enemy, who then turned towards the Poles, and made a very fierce charge upon them; The Poles received them likewise with great Bravery, and being very well se∣conded by the Imperialists, made a great slaughter of the Enemy; who seeing one of their chief Bassa's slain, and an other taken Prisoner, fled towards <HI>Barkan;</HI> the Christians pursued them very close, and fired upon them with their Cannon, which the King and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> caused to advance for that purpose. Of the Enemy some got over the Bridge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, which happily for us broke, others threw themselves into <HI>Barkan,</HI> some were drowned, and others taken Prisoners, so that of this whole Body, not above 4000 escaped. The Imperial Foot and Dragoons ad∣vanced, and the Regiment of <HI>Castelli,</HI> and some other com∣manded Troops attacked the Counterscarp of <HI>Barkan,</HI> be∣ing led on by the Count <HI>de Staremberg,</HI> and took it with their Swords in their hands, and putt all the Turks that were there to the Sword, but gave quarter to 500 Janisaries that were in the place, and who surrendred on discretion. The Chri∣stians, after having pillaged <HI>Barkan,</HI> set fire to it, and as well there as in the Enemies Camp, which covered the said Fort, as likewise the City of <HI>Gran,</HI> they had a great deal of Plunder; 20 Pieces of Cannon, with great quantities of Provisions and Ammunition, and many fine Horses, with very rich Furniture, were taken; and the Prisoners declare, that after this second defeat, the Christians will not meet with any considerable resistance any where, there being a very great consternation among the Turks. They in <HI>Gran</HI> continued to fire upon the Christian Troops that were in sight of them, till night, and renewed the same the next morning; but their Cannon was but small, and did us little harm. The Christians quite ruined the Bridge of <HI>Gran,</HI> and when thee Letters came away, they were passing the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> over a Bridge of Boats (which was brought from <HI>Comor∣ra</HI>) in order to their attacking that place, the principal For∣tifications whereof have it's said been very much damnified by Thunder; and their best Cannon, and greatest part of their Ammunition sent to the Siege of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
