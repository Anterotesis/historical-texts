<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is not needfull to say much concerning the late agreement betwixt His Sacred Majesty <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Great Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. and the City and Kingdom of <HI>Al∣gier;</HI> (the Articles whereof are in these follow∣ing Papers, word for word exhibited) For certain∣ly, that man is very little read in the world, who sees not how much this Peace imports the benefit and security of the <HI>English</HI> Commerce, and no less the honour of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; especially considering the start it has given us of our powerfull Neighbours, who are still labouring under great trouble, charge and difficulty with those people: and the Accord is yet more glorious, if we observe the time wherein it was made; that is to say, it was made at a time when the <HI>English</HI> lay patiently exposed to all the inconveniences, which ei∣ther the Fables or the Councils of <HI>Holland</HI> could give them; menaced in the very Channel by an open Force, and deserted in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> after such a manner, that we are loth to make use of a word, answerable to the quality of the action: the Hollanders having first invited us into a conjunct engagement with them, and afterward not only quitting the place by stealth and surprize, but invading at the same time our Rights in <HI>Guine:</HI> And yet so it is at last, that notwithstanding all these practises and disappointments, we have now liv'd to see the Hollanders swallow their own resolutions, by with-drawing their Shipping, and contenting themselves with the blind Passage of the North, rather then adventuring to give his Royal Highness the Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> the un-mannerly provocation of pres∣sing through the Channel. And we ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> likewise liv'd to injoy the Fruits of that Peace, which others have in vain attempted; and not only so, but to fee our selves acquitted of the guilt of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a solemn Declara∣tion of the Government it self of <HI>Algier,</HI> and the breath charg'd upon the tumults and disorders of their own Subjects: they themselves not sticking publickly to avow, that an agreement with <HI>England</HI> was to them so neces∣sary, that they were not able to maintain an entercourse and correspondence without it.</P>
<P>This being the sum and state of that Affair, gives sufficiently to under∣stand, how great a care His <HI>Majesty</HI> hath of the reputation and welfare of His people, and of the true interest of the <HI>English</HI> Crown and Nation. And it is our further happiness, that the Orders and Directions of so wise and gracious a Prince, are committed into the hands of suitable Officers and Ministers, as hath been manifested throughout the whole course and con∣duct of this Transaction.</P>
