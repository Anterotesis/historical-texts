<HEAD>A LETTER from <HI>MOSCOW</HI> TO THE Marquess of <HI>CARMARTHEN,</HI> Relating to the Czar of Muscovy's Forwardness in his GREAT NAVY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Since His <HI>RETURN</HI> Home.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Publish'd by His Lordship's Permission.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Moscow, <DATE><HI>March</HI> 8. 1698/9. <HI>O.S.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have deferr'd writing, till I could be able to give Your Lordship a true Account (from my own Knowledge) of the <HI>Czar</HI> (our Master's) Navy, which being a New Thing in the World as yet, I believe is variously talk'd of in <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> First, At <HI>Voronize</HI> there is already in the Water and Rigg'd, 36, and to be Launch'd in the Spring 20 more stout Ships, from 30 to 60 Guns. Next, 18 very large Gallies (built after the <HI>Venetian</HI> manner by <HI>Italian</HI> Masters) are already compleated; and 100 smaller Gallies or Brigantines are equipt for the Sea; 7 Bomb-Ships are Launch'd and Rigg'd, and 4 Fireships are Building against the Spring, when they are all to go down to <HI>Azoph.</HI> The Ships are chiefly built by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>The 25th of <HI>August</HI> last his Majesty came to <HI>Moscow, incognito;</HI> immediately he took in hand the rewarding of General <HI>Gordon</HI>'s Soldiers, that fought against the Re∣bels he defeated in <HI>June</HI> last, and next day gave Orders to fetch up all those of the Rebels who were dispersed by way of Banishment, which were in all then left about 2700. I suppose Your Lordship has been inform'd by Publick News, how they are hung round the Walls of this City, some hundreds beheaded, some broke upon the Wheel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the whole Number of them, which was in all 3000.</P>
<P>At my Arrival in <HI>Moscow,</HI> I fell very ill of the Bloody-Flux, which made me be in <HI>Moscow</HI> when his Majesty came home: About the latter end of <HI>October</HI> I was somewhat recovered, his Majesty then carried me down to <HI>Voronize</HI> with him. <HI>Voro∣nize</HI> is about 400 <HI>English</HI> Miles <HI>South-East</HI> from <HI>Moscow.</HI> There the <HI>Czar</HI> immediate∣ly set up a Ship of 60 Guns, where he is both Foreman and Master-Builder; and not to flatter him, I'le assure Your Lordship it will be the best Ship among them, and 'tis all from his own Draught: How he fram'd her together, and how he made the Mould, and in so short a time as he did, is really wonderful: But he is able at this day to put his own Notions into Practice, and laugh at his <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Builders for their Ignorance. There are several Pieces of Workmanship, as in the Keel, Stem, and Post, which are all purely his own Invention, and sound good Work, and would be approved of by all the Shipwrights of <HI>England,</HI> if they saw it. She has a round Tuck, and a narrow Floor, a good tumbling Home, and Circular Side; none are to exceed 11 <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot Draught of Water. He has not run into any Extreme, But taken the Mediums of all good Sailing Properties, which seem best. One may, methinks, call her an Abstract of his own private Observations whilst Abroad, strengthned by Your Lordship's Improving Discourses to him on that Sub∣ject, and his own extraordinary Notion of Sailing. One thing as to her Keel is, That should it wholly be beat out, yet it is so ordered, that the Ship will be tight and safe, and may continue so at Sea afterwards.</P>
<P>I likewise made a Suit of Moulds for a Ship of Sixty Guns, but after some time fell sick again; and at <HI>Christmas,</HI> when his Majesty came to <HI>Moscow,</HI> he brought me back again for Recovery of my Health, where I am at present; notwithstanding, both our
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>Ships go forward, having put things in such a posture, as that a <HI>Grecian</HI> (who has been in <HI>England</HI>) carries on the Business. Mr. <HI>Ney</HI> is Building of a 60 Gun Ship there too; besides, there are four of that Size (near built) upon the <HI>Done,</HI> two of 40 Guns already at <HI>Azoph,</HI> carried down some time since, and a great many Galleys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Rivers <HI>Vorona,</HI> at <HI>Voronitz,</HI> when I was there, was hardly so broad as the Ships are long; but in the Spring about the latter End of <HI>April,</HI> or beginning of <HI>May,</HI> when the Snow melts, there is 16 Foot Water in that little River, and continues this height about 12 or 14 days, with a Rapid Torrent, with that force, that though it be 1000 Miles down to <HI>Azoph,</HI> yet the Ships will easily be there in 9 or 10 days. There is 30000 Soldiers at <HI>Voronize,</HI> to defend the Ships from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who are very mischievous, and very swift in setting a place on Fire, and running away again. Those Ships that are Launcht lie fast in Ice about two Foot thick, so that the River is now as firm as Land, although this is reckoned a very mild Winter; for I remember in <HI>January</HI> one Afternoon with a <HI>Southerly</HI> Wind it thaw'd and rain'd for 3 or 4 hours, which is rare enough for an Almanack. The Ground is covered with Snow about a Yard deep, and 'tis mighty clear, piercing cold Weather, such as in <HI>England</HI> we can't imagine.</P>
<P>Looking against the Sun, one may see innumerable Atoms of congeal'd Snow, flying up and down the Sky like Dust; but within Doors the Rooms are about as warm as 'tis in <HI>June</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> made so by Stoves, all over of a soft familiar heat. As to the Temper of the Climate in general, the Summers (as last was) are ex∣cessive hot, the Winter as cold; the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> and part of <HI>May,</HI> the Coun∣try is almost drown'd by excessive overflowings of the Rivers, occasioned by the melted Snow. The Land in Summer is pleasant all over, and fertil, and all provi∣sions wonderful cheap; as, a good fat Sheep for four Shillings, Bread, Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pro∣portionably; and even now in Winter 'tis not much dearer. I hope by this time Twelve-Months, to give Your Lordship (in <HI>England</HI>) a particular Description of the Country by word of Mouth. His Majesty was at my Chamber two days of last Week, with Mr. <HI>Styles</HI> as Interpreter (who gives his humble duty to Your Lordship) You may guess what His Majesty came to be inform'd in whilst he was there; I shew'd him a Model of a Machine to bring up the <HI>Royal Transport</HI> to the <HI>Volga,</HI> at 17 Inches Draught of Water; he was pleas'd to like it, but gave no Orders for put∣ting it in Execution, so I believe she will lie where she is now, and perish. Here are Three Envoys, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Emperor's,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgs,</HI> in this <HI>Slabado,</HI> (as it is call'd,) which lies from <HI>Moscow,</HI> as <HI>Lambeth</HI> does from <HI>London.</HI> The whole place is Inhabited by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> I believe there may be 400 Families. Last <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Monday</HI> the Strangers were invited to the Consecration of General <HI>La Fort</HI>'s New House, which is the noblest Building in <HI>Russia,</HI> and finely furnisht. There were all the Envoys, and as near as I could guess 200 Gentlemen, <HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and about as many Ladies; each Day were Dancing and Musick. All the Envoys, and all the Lords (but three in <HI>Moscow</HI>) are going to <HI>Voronize</HI> to see the Fleet, I suppose. His Majesty went last <HI>Sunday</HI> to <HI>Voronize</HI> with Prince <HI>Alexander,</HI> and I am to go down (being something recovered) with the Vice-Admiral about six days hence. This day was a Muster of all the Seamen and Officers in his Majesty's Service, ¾ of which are discharg'd: They are to go home by the way of <HI>Narve.</HI> Capt. <HI>Perry,</HI> who was sent to make a Communication between the Rivers <HI>Volga</HI> and <HI>Done,</HI> near <HI>Astracan,</HI> is returned from Surveying the same; he makes it appear Feasible enough to be done; accordingly his Majesty has ordered 40000 Men to be rais'd, and Materials provided for doing the same; which he has promis'd to finish in Five years, tho' I believe it may be done in less. When that is perform'd, then the <HI>Czar</HI> may carry his Ships from the <HI>Black Sea</HI> into the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> and extend his Conquest that way.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> What I have writ, I wish it may be any Satisfaction to Your Lord∣ship, and I have my End, who am,</P>
