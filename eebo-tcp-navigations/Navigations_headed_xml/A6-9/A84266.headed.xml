<HEAD>Joyfull Newes FROM SHERBOVRNE CASTLE;</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Earle of <HI>Bedford</HI> hath besieged <HI>Sherbourn</HI> Castle where the Marquesse of <HI>Hartford</HI> hath, incamped himselfe, having but 800. Horse, and a small number of Foot, and the Earle of <HI>Bedford</HI> hath 30000. men both Horse and Foot; by which meanes it is impossible that they, should escape, onely the Castle is strong, being built by Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> and guarded with a Grove of
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Wood, by which meanes his men have great o∣portunity to make out-works to keepe them from having accesse or comming over readily to offend or surprize the Castle.</P>
<P>But they, after their escape from <HI>Wells,</HI> being so fiercely pursued by the Forces of the Parlia∣ment they wanted time to furnish themselves with needfull provision, (namely Victuals) as Corne, Bread, Beefe, or the like, by reason of which they are in great want of sustenance, only from <HI>Wittom</HI> and <HI>Evercrutch</HI> Parke, the Manners of Sr. <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> before the Arrivall of the Earle of <HI>Bedford,</HI> they received such provision as they could at that instant provide, as Venison and such other things as they could spare.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Bristow.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BRistow</HI> hath sent the Earle of <HI>Bedford</HI> both men and Ordnance to batter downe the out-Works, so that they might have free recourse to the Castle, the Citizens being very ready to lend their aid and assistance, and to disburse Moneys for all sorts of provision, that may further that Service, (namely) Powder, March, and Bullet, and all things that can be thought necessary for such a designe.</P>

<HEAD>From Exeter.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EXeter</HI> hath sent men to his aid, with store of Munition, so that tis impossible that any of those disturbers should escape, or gaine power to breed a further trouble in that Country.</P>

<HEAD>From Beverley.</HEAD>
<P>THe Siedge being raised, Sr. <HI>Iohn Hotha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> hath Fortesied <HI>Beverley,</HI> being a strong Towne, and one of the greatest Markets in all that County.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Boston.</HEAD>
<P>INformation is given from <HI>Boston,</HI> that on Thursday last a Thousand men were raised on that side of the Country, for to appreh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ten Cavaliers which were landed at <HI>Serges</HI> neere <HI>Boston,</HI> with 3. Ships wherein was great store of treasure, severall Trunks being landed and they drawing up their Ordnance to guard it. it is conceived that they were pursued by the Earle of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> and forced to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in there to secure themselves.</P>

<HEAD>From Oxford.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OXford</HI> Schollars have carried great store of Stones to the top of the Tower of <HI>Maudlins</HI> Colldege which joynes to the Bridge with intent to throw them downe upon the heads of those that shall oppose them.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P> The Schollars are all turned Cavaliers, ha∣ving to their Commanders the Tapster of the <HI>Roe-Buck,</HI> and the Chamberlaine of the <HI>Red Li∣on,</HI> with the assistance of a <HI>Barber.</HI></P>
<P>These commit severall outrages on the in∣habitants of the Towne, being countenanced by the Principles of the Colledges as tis gene∣rally conceived, if this be the fruit of learning, good Lord deliver us.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Jreland.</HEAD>
<P>AT <HI>Bristow</HI> there landed certaine Irish Mar∣chants, who comming before the Major declared very sad ridings, the summe of which was, that at <HI>Washford</HI> the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath set up his Standard.</P>
<P>Likewise declaring the great misery that Kingdome is like to undergoe if present aid be not sent over.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the 6. of <HI>September</HI> certaine Ca∣valiers were brought to Towne, which were taken neere <HI>Boston.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To this I have thought good to adde a fit discourse that doth some∣what allure to this.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen that England and Scotland was in Contention, the T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kish EMPEROUR had an intention invade them; and take the ad∣vantage of their civill discord; to which end he summoned all <HI>Bashames</HI> and <HI>Beglerbegs,</HI> giving them notice of his intention, withall demanding their advice, which most of them did, applauding the designe, but one among the rest stood up, and desired a hearing, which being granted, hee told the Emperour that in a dreame his fancie shewed him a vision which was as followeth.</P>
<P>He thought he faw two brothers fighting sorely for a prize, and during their combate there came a thiefe and endeaeoured to feise the prize which they fought for, which the two brothers seeing, left fighting with one a∣nother and beat him sorely, taking him and
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>binding him hand and foote, and carried him into eternall captivity.</P>
<P><HI>Great Emperour</HI> (sayes he) though England and Scotland jarre in private contention, and hurt one another sorely, yet if any forraigne e∣nemy should venture upon them they will like the two brothers full upon him and doubtlesse great will be his overthrow.</P>
<P>The Emperour heard this and desisted in his designe, esteeming his counselled the best, giving him great thankes, saying thou hast well counselld.</P>
<P>This may be applyed to Spaine, and I doe pray heartily that it would please God to putt into his Majesties heart to joyne with the Par∣liament, that so these forces might be employ∣ed against Spain which seekes the ruine of the Church and Protestant Religion, that as in England so in Ireland, Gods word may flourish and the whore of Babilon bee utterly destroy∣ed.</P>
