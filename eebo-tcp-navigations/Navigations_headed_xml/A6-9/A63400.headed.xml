<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> the 21st. of <HI>August,</HI> 1689. about Eight of the Clock in the Morning, his Grace the Duke of <HI>Schonberg,</HI> with fourteen Regiments of Foot, sailed from <HI>High-lake,</HI> and safely landed at <HI>Banger,</HI> about One of the Clock in the Afternoon of the day following; upon the appea∣rance of the Fleet, several small Boats came from the Shoar, at least two Leagues to meet it, to give an Account of the Country and the Harbours thereabouts, as also giving an Account of the <HI>Irish</HI> Army, both Horse, Dragoons, and Foot, flying from their Quarters upon the News of the <HI>English</HI> Army Landing. So great was the Con∣sternation amongst them, that several ran as far as <HI>Newry,</HI> being 36 Miles, before they stopt, to know either the quality or quantity of the Army. The appearance of our Fleet did so much comfort the Protestants of that Country, that the Shoar was covered with Horses, Cows, and Sheep for the benefit and advantage of the Army, and Provisions of all sorts being so plentifully brought in; a quarter of good Mutton was sold at four pence, and every thing else at very reasonable rates. The General made Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s House at <HI>Banger</HI> his head Quarters, and giving Orders that all Men should on pain of Death stand to Arms all that Night, having first very advantagiously lined some Hedges and Ditches with small Shot. At Night an Allarm was in the Camp of the Enemies approach; whereupon the whole Army was resolved to main∣tain their Ground, but this afterwards appeared a Stratagem of War, to try the Mens courage in case the Enemy had really attackt them. The next day the General received Advice, that the Enemy then at <HI>Car∣rickfergus</HI> were intended to Plunder and Burn the Towns of <HI>Belfast</HI> and <HI>Lisburn;</HI> whereupon Collonel <HI>Wharton</HI>'s Regiment of Foot were im∣mediately ordered to March from the Camp at <HI>Banger</HI> to <HI>Belfast,</HI> which was saved from Plunder and Fire, some of the Enemy being killed, and others taken Prisoners: Within two or three days afterwards, the Army decampt from <HI>Banger,</HI> and encampt at <HI>Belfast</HI> for two Nights, and then moved in order to the besieging of the Town and Castle of <HI>Carick∣fergus:</HI> on our approach against that place the General summoned the Town by a Drum, and a Parley was agreed to, but the besieged insist∣ing upon very great Conditions, <HI>viz.</HI> to March out with flying Colours, Arms, Baggage, and Plunder, then pretended to be their Property; the General would not agree to them, but in regard there were many Protestants in the Town, was willing to comply on reasonable Terms, but the besieged utterly refused any manner of Conditions, other than what they had proposed, and if such were not agreed to, would dispute the Town, which the General his Grace finding them so obstinate, or∣dered 4 Battering Guns, and 2 Morter Pieces, to be planted at the Pi∣geon house very near the Town, and played for a considerable time hotly against the Castle and Town, while the lines of Circumvallation were flinging up, and then Batteries were raised on the lines, but being at too great a distance, no great prejudice was done; the General ob∣serving the Batteries to be at great distance, did in Person ride within 40 paces of the Walls, and appointed the Ground for a new Battery, and running the line of Circumvallation, so that the next day 6 Pieces of Cannon and 2 Morters were drawn up to that Ground; from this Battery the Besiege were so warmly saluted with our 6 Cannon, one Morter casting Shells of 600 <HI>l.</HI> weight, and the other flinging 9 small Shells at once into the Town, with a continued Firing of our small Shot from the Trenches, that they hung up a Flag and begg'd for a Par∣ley, the besiegers having made 4 Breaches in their Wall, the General being inclinable to preserve the Protestants in the Town, did hearken to a second Treaty; the Conditions were, that the besieged should March out with their Arms, and to March no further in a day than the Convoy appointed for them pleased; the General had not made any Conditions with them, had it not been on the account of the Protestants in the Town, he being affronted on the first Parley; for when the Enemy had mounted some Guns on their Walls, and put other things into order, which could not possibly be done without a forbearance of firing from the Trenches, they barbarously fired a warning Piece, and took down their Flag, and began to fire furiously after the General, and some Officers before they could get fairly off; however his Grace was pleased to perfect Articles with the besieged, and the next day they Marcht out about 400, there being several killed in the Town, but the Country People who were before plundered by them, came down and took what they saw was their own, so that in two or three miles March, the Enemy lost most of their Baggage; the General was much of∣fended at this usage to the besieged, but it was a thing altogether im∣possible to be prevented, the Rable falling so numerously upon them, and taking their own goods where ever they found them; for seven days the Army lay against the Town constantly firing, and 2 Frigots lying before the Castle firing Broad-side after Broad-side so mighty sharply that there was a continued light clear round the Town the whol, Night, and to do the besieged right, they behaved themselves verey brave as any Men could do. When the Town and Castle were actually in our hands, we found several hundred Barrels of Beef, Pork, Pease, Wheat, Malt, and Oatmeal in the Stores, but very little Ammunition. As we Marcht against the Town of <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> the General received Advice that 16 Troops of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Horse, and 2 Troops of Dragoons were on their March to join us by Major General <HI>Kirk</HI>'s Orders, which they accordingly did, and at that time they were acceptable enough, there being no Horse landed out of <HI>England;</HI> the next day Collonel <HI>Coy</HI>'s Regiment of Horse, Collonel <HI>Levison</HI>'s Regiment of Dragoons, and several Regiments of Foot, landed at the <HI>White-house</HI> near <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> and upon our March from the Siege, the Lord <HI>Delamare</HI>'s, and Lord <HI>Devonshire</HI>'s Regiments of Horse, and Sir <HI>Tho. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owre</HI>'s Regiment of Foot joined us, so that we intirely Marcht to <HI>Belfast,</HI> save Sir <HI>Hen. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regiment of Foot left in Garison at <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> Major General <HI>Kirk</HI> remaining with his and some of <HI>London-Derry</HI> Forces at <HI>Coleraine.</HI> On the 3d. of <HI>Sept.</HI> we Marcht to <HI>Lisburn,</HI> having sent most of our heavy Luggage and Guns by Sea, in order to meet us at <HI>Dundalk</HI> or <HI>Drogheda;</HI> and now there being about 800 of the <HI>Irish</HI> in the <HI>Glens</HI> near <HI>Glenarme,</HI> in the County of <HI>Antrim,</HI> headed by one <HI>Mac Donnel</HI> Naturalson to the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> who very much infested that Country. One Captain <HI>Stewart</HI> was ordered to detach a certain number out of Sir <HI>H. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regi∣ment, to suppress these Rebels, which was accordingly done, and a con∣siderable prey of Cattle got from them.</P>
<P>On <HI>September</HI> the 4th, we encamped at <HI>Dromore,</HI> being seven Miles from <HI>Lisburn,</HI> and received an account that Major General <HI>Mackay</HI> was landed at <HI>Belfast,</HI> with some Horse and Dragoons; but this proved a mistake: On the 5th we encamped at <HI>Loghbracklan,</HI> and the Enemy being then at <HI>Newry,</HI> in a considerable Body, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Berwick;</HI> the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Horse were ordered for the advance Guards, who discovering a great Body of Horse, thought fit to retreat, believing the Enemy might have pursued, and so followed them into our Camp, which was in a readiness to receive them; but the Enemy imagining some such thing, did not at all pursue them, but thought to keep the Pass at the <HI>Newry.</HI> On our March two Drums belonging to the Lord <HI>King∣ston</HI>'s Regiment were hanged near <HI>Dromore,</HI> having revolted and got in∣to <HI>Carickfergus</HI> at the time of the Siege. On the 6th, we encamped at <HI>Newry,</HI> the Enemy having deserted that Pass, and burnt the Town, with all the Inhabitants Goods, and flinging a piece of Cannon into the River, and moved to <HI>Dundalk,</HI> 8 Miles from <HI>Newry,</HI> the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Horse (the Duke's <HI>Tartars,</HI> for so they were termed,) still keeping the advance Guard, who marched so near the Town of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> that they took a prey of 150 Cows from the Enemy's Quarters in their view, with some Sheep, and great quantities of Oatmeal and Butter. We continued our Camp at the <HI>Newry</HI> till the 8th, and the General having advice that the Enemy were marched from <HI>Dundalk,</HI> only leaving some few Troops there for a Rear-guard, ordered the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces to march forward, and detached 50 Foot out of each Regiment, and 20 out of a Troop, to follow the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces towards <HI>Dundalk,</HI> having before sent a Trumpet to tell them, that if they burned the Town, or destroyed any more Towns on their retreat, or destroy'd the Prote∣stants Goods, he would not extend mercy to any that should happen in his power, and that Major General <HI>Macarty,</HI> then Prisoner at <HI>Iniskil∣ling,</HI> should be executed; this so terrified them that they march'd a∣way without firing the Town of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> or doing any great harm to the Protestants there; and at 8 of the Clock at Night we entered the Town with these Detachments, and found there great stores of Wheat and other Grain, and Salt, laid up in stores for the Irish Army; when the whole Body of the Army had moved up, we encamped at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> the one part of the Army on the <HI>Newry</HI> side of the River, and the Dutch Regiments, with the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces on <HI>Dundalk</HI> side, and in some few days after had marched forward, but that our Cannon and Provisions did not come by Sea so soon as was expected, nor were there draught-horses for our March in case both Ammunition, Guns, and Provision had come by the time expected; which was the chief cause of the Army not moving upwards towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> Comissary <HI>Shales</HI> not sending the Horses over in due time: Upon our coming to <HI>Dundalk</HI> the Army plentifully fed on the Lord of <HI>Duleek</HI>'s Mutton, he having fled, and in command with the Rebels: Upon our approach to <HI>Dundalk,</HI> the Enemy likewise deserted <HI>Atherdee</HI> being 8 Miles from <HI>Drogheda,</HI> and some of the English Forces advanced so far, and then the late King <HI>James</HI> designed to rendezvouze his Forces, and encamp on the other side of the River of <HI>Boyn</HI> beyond <HI>Drogheda;</HI> but finding the En∣glish Army did not move forward, sent a Body of Horse and some Foot to <HI>Atherdee,</HI> and secured that Town, banishing the Protestants and ta∣king their Substance; between which place and <HI>Dundalk</HI> there was some small skirmishing, and particularly at <HI>Mapestown-bridge</HI> our Scou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s met some of the Enemy, killed about 9, and took some Prisoners; in which action one of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Horse and an English Dragoon fell by an Ambuscado. On the 15th, the Enemy's Van guard, consisting of 4000 Horse were seen to advance within 4 or 5 Miles of our Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>the General not having Horse enough to engage them, ordered some Trenches to be cast up a small way beyond the Town of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> be∣tween us and the Enemy, where the two Dutch Regiments were con∣stantly encamped, and 2 Regiments mounted the Trenches every day, and ordered 8 pieces of Cannon to be planted upon the Works. On the 16th Major General <HI>Scragmore</HI> embarked for <HI>England;</HI> and on the 17th, Mr. <HI>Holsort,</HI> the General's Secretary, died at <HI>Dundalk:</HI> On the 18th, 100 Men out of each Regiment were detached to bring the Forage be∣tween the Enemy and us: On the same day 24 Companies of Foot and 4 Troops of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Forces joyned us in the Camp, and brought 600 Cows with them, leaving one Regiment of Foot, and some Troops of Horse at <HI>Iniskilling.</HI> About this time Collonel <HI>Gustavus Hamilton</HI>'s Re∣giment of Foot, Collonel <HI>Langston</HI>'s Horse, and part of Collonel <HI>Villers</HI>'s Regiment of Horse, landed at <HI>Belfast,</HI> which Horse were daily expected in the Camp; but Collonel <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Foot were ordered to <HI>Carickfer∣gus,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hen. Ingoldsby</HI>'s to march to the Camp. In this time the Enemy daily encreased, and came downwards in great Bodies; and on the 19th, the Irish Scouts appeared within a Mile of the Town of <HI>Dun∣dalk,</HI> with whom out Out-guards had a smart Dispute, in which some fell on both sides. On the 20th, two Gentlemen came from the Irish Army, and gave the General an account that the Irish were very nu∣merous, but many of them Rabble, and that several Protestants had great desire to come off if they could doe it with safety; and that the Late King <HI>James</HI> was in person at the head of them, and were encam∣ped at <HI>Lurgan Race,</HI> 3 Miles from <HI>Dundalk.</HI> On the 21st, about 7 of the Clock in the Morning several of the Enemy's Troops were seen ad∣vancing near our Camp, and about 10 the whole Body of Horse, con∣sisting of 10000, drew up into 5 divisions within half a Mile of our Trenches, their whole Body of Foot being about 35000 were in the Rear of the Horse; which account the General had from a Deserter, who farther said, that although they appeared in so great numbers, yet they had not above 4 or 5000 good Horse, the rest being ill mounted, and worse armed, several of their Horse being Lanciers for want of other Arms, and the greatest part of the Foot a perfect Rabble, and fit∣ter for plunder than doing service: Some of the Enemy's Horse advan∣ced within Musket Shot of our Trenches, but were forced to retreat, being warmly received by some Granadeers at the Bog side, between our Camp and the Enemy's Body, and thereupon the General ordered a good guard of Horse to march towards them, but the Bog being be∣tween, no action happened: His Grace likewise ordered 300 of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Foot, commanded by Collonel <HI>Tiffin,</HI> to march down to the Bog side, the Enemy having drawn down a Body of Foot to the other side of the Bog, and lined all the Hedges and Ditches thereabouts; se∣veral firings were on both sides, but being at too great a distance, no great harm was done; and so brave was the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Foot, that they passionately desired to march over the Bog, and in order to it, every Man of them stript off his Coat, so that instead of a grey Regiment they appeared in white, being their usual way in fighting to enable them for better action in the service; the General with a strong Guard rid round the Bog, and posted Men at all places where he apprehended danger; in this manner both Armies stood in readiness, but no En∣gagement, and after the late King <HI>James</HI> with his whole Army, had re∣mained so for 4 or 5 hours, he marched back to his Camp. On the 23d, 6 Men were taken, one whereof being an experienced Soldier, but a private Centinel, had drawn a Scheme of our Camp, where we lay open, how the Enemy might have fallen in upon us, how our Men sickned, what number of Horse and Foot we were, and how victualled, and was going over to the Late King, but he and the other 5 were taken, and this Scheme found upon him; so that they were all hanged, and 150 more of the French who were suspected, sent Priso∣ners to <HI>Chester.</HI> It is believed that the Late King had some assurance of the French Regiments deserting, if both Armies had then engaged. On the 25th, we had advice from <HI>Sligo,</HI> that Collonel <HI>Lloyd,</HI> with 5 Compa∣nies of Foot, and 4 Troops of Horse and Dragroons, had engaged the Enemy at <HI>Abbyboyle,</HI> and killed 300 in the Church, and in the pursuit took Collonel <HI>Kelly,</HI> Collonel <HI>Dillon,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Farrel,</HI> and killed 300 more, having the pursuit of them for about 11 or 12 Miles, and had their Horse been first, might have cut off the whole Body, being 5000; in which action but 6 of the Protestants were killed, and 5 wounded; for joy of which great Conquest, there was a running Fire through the Camp, and the Guns in the Fleet returned the same.</P>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>Octob.</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> Army decamped and Marcht towards <HI>Drogheda,</HI> having first burned the whole Country about them, setting all their Huts on fire before they marcht away: Salt, Tobacco, and Brandy were very scarce among them, and more especially Salt, for that the Soldiers were forced to boil their Meat in Salt Water, little or no Silver was current amongst them, but all Copper. On the 6th. the General had an account how Collonel <HI>Lloyd</HI> had taken <HI>James</HI> Town and <HI>Carugdrumroosk</HI> from the Enemy; on the 8th. 150 Horse Granadeers, 150 Dragroons, and 150 <HI>Inskilling</HI> Horse were detacht to March to <HI>Sligo,</HI> commanded by Collonel <HI>Russel</HI> and Collonel <HI>Tiffin:</HI> At their coming to <HI>Sligo</HI> the Enemy were prepared for them, and a smart Engagement happened; but at length about 80 of the Granadeers possessed them∣selves of the Fort, and very well defended the same for some days a∣gainst Collonel <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and his Forces; but being straightened for Pro∣vision, were forced to capitulate and made honourable Conditions, which were performed by Collonel <HI>Sarsfield,</HI> yet he endeavoured by all fair means to bring these Men over to King <HI>James</HI> upon promises of Preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they utterly refused him. When the late King had decamed, his Grace the Duke of <HI>Schonberg</HI> ordered the greatest part of the Army to Winter Quarters, making <HI>Lisburn</HI> his own head Quarters; but there being some Shipping in the River of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> which could not sail for want of a Wind, Collonel <HI>L. Moleniere</HI> was left Govern∣our at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> with 4 Regiments of Foot, and some Horse, to preserve these Shipping from the Enemy until they could get out, and then the 4 Regiments marcht intirely from <HI>Dundalk</HI> to Winter Quarters; Sir <HI>H. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regiment being left at the <HI>Newry</HI> the frontier Garison. As soon as the Protestant Forces had Marcht from <HI>Dundalk,</HI> the Enemy possessed themselves of that place, and most of the Creates, or poor Country People, droven up by the <HI>Irish</HI> Army, returned to that Coun∣try, and remained upon the Mountains between <HI>Dundalk</HI> and the <HI>New∣ry,</HI> several of them endeavouring to bring what small stock of Cattle they had into the County of <HI>Down;</HI> such as brought any goods with them were admitted to go into the Counties of <HI>Down</HI> and <HI>Antrim,</HI> but such as brought nothing, were sent back to the Mountains again, and not per∣mitted to go into our Country. Sir <HI>Hen. Ingoldsby</HI>'s Regiment being at the <HI>Newry,</HI> commanded by Leiutenant Collonel <HI>Purcel,</HI> Governour of that place, remained peaceably there till about the 5th. or 6th. of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> at which time the Governour had an Account of a considerable Body, both Horse and Foot, of the Enemy were marching towards <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and intended to attack the Garison at <HI>Newry,</HI> being the Key of the <HI>North;</HI> whereupon 60 Men and a Captain were passed at Narrow Water, 12 with a Serjeant at <HI>Fatham</HI> Castle, being a pass on the River, which was fordable when the Tide was out; and likewise a conside∣rable number of Men were at Pointz pass, and these being the only dangerous Passes and thus fortified, Collonel <HI>Purcel</HI> thought himself se∣cure as to the Pass at the <HI>Newry;</HI> but about the 8th. or 9th of <HI>December</HI> 1700 Foot, and 6 Troops of Horse and Dragoons, came within a quarter of a mile of <HI>Newry,</HI> out of which 300 were detacht and sent into the Town by break of day, having killed our out Guards: Upon which the Garison received the Allarm, yet so very quick was the Enemy, that they were in the Town before the main Guard could draw out, there not being above 40 effectual Men, who behaved themselves so well, that they forced that part of the Enemy marching up from the Bridge to retreat, but some of the Enemy getting sooner into the Town, and having notice where the Officers quartered, killed Captain <HI>Whitfield</HI> going out of his Quarters, and killed Captain <HI>Miller</HI> in the street; Leiutenant <HI>Shrould</HI> received a wound on the thigh, whereof he died, and 4 of the Soldiers killed. There was killed of the Enemy a Lieu∣tenant Collonel, with 14 Men in the Town, besides several taken off dead, and many wounded, of which the Governour had a certain ac∣count afterwards: The main Body finding the forlorn thus defeated, marcht back to <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and altho' they have often resolved to attack the Garison again, have never yet attempted it; and since they could not come into the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Ireland</HI> at the Passes of Naview Water, fathom Castle, Newry or Pointz his Pass, they intended to attack the Garison at <HI>Belturbet</HI> in the County of <HI>Cavan,</HI> then and now under the command of Collonel <HI>Wolsely,</HI> Collonel of a Regiment of the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Horse, and think to get into the <HI>North</HI> that way; but Collonel <HI>Wolsely</HI> having an ac∣count of their design resolved to prevent them, and on the 12th. of <HI>March</HI> with 700 Foot and 300 Horse marcht towards <HI>Cavan,</HI> where 2000 of the Enemy were; his purpose was to fall upon them by break of day, ha∣ving but 7 Miles to March from <HI>Belturbet</HI> to <HI>Cavan;</HI> but the Enemy ha∣ving posted some small number of Men at a place called <HI>Butlers</HI>-Bridge, the Collonel could not pass there without allarming them, which would very soon after be at <HI>Cavan,</HI> therefore it was agreed to March peaceably up the River-side, to afoord at a place called <HI>Bullynacarrig</HI> being 4 Miles out of the way, when the Collonel had advanced as far as this place, the Enemy had likewise some Men posted there, who gave notice to them of <HI>Cavan,</HI> the Collonel notwithstanding marcht all his Men over the Biver, and soon after day-light was within half a mile of <HI>Cavan</HI> on <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> side of the Town, but instead of surprizing them, he found their Garison re-inforced by 2000, and the whole Body fairly formed into a defensive posture, and ready to receive him, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Berwick;</HI> this much surprized him, and to retreat would certainly ruin the whole business, therefore the Collonel detached 150, and po∣sted them at a convenient pass for a reserve, and with the remainder charged the Enemy; the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Dragoons made the first on-set, but were forced to lose ground, upon this the Collonel commanded some <HI>Dutch</HI> Granadeers to march up, who behaved themselves so well, that the Enemy lost ground; by which means the <HI>Iniskilling</HI> Dragoons rallied and joined the body again, and then for an hour the matter was horly dis∣puted, and at length the Enemy took to flight, one part of them made to the Fort, and the other towards <HI>Finah.</HI> In the pursuit were killed 139 besides several Officers, Collonel, <HI>Edmond O Reily,</HI> with some other Officers of great Note was killed in the first Engagement; on our side we lost 4 Captains and 20 Men. When this action was over, the <HI>Ini∣skilling</HI> Men began to plunder the Town, and were stragling in odd numbers about the place, which the Enemy discovering from the Fort, drew out a fresh party, and came down upon them; but the reserve as I mentioned before, being in order and a readiness engaged them, and forced them into the Fort again, and then Collonel <HI>Wolsley</HI> ordered the Town to be burned, and likewise burned <HI>Killishandrew</HI> on his March to <HI>Belturbet;</HI> in some few days after, a party of Horse fell on some of the Enemy, who were intrencht at <HI>Butlers</HI>-Bridge, killing about 36 and taking several Prisoners, with the chief Officers commanding there, in which second action not a man of the Protestants were lost. As for the Garison of <HI>Charlemont,</HI> they are in a manner blockt up, for since Collonel <HI>Withers</HI> burned the Bridge, and took their Boats, they cannot make any incursions into the Country, we having Garisons at <HI>Dungannon, Armagh, Benburl,</HI> and <HI>Loghgall;</HI> the General took a view of the place and makes no doubt of having it before the Army take the Field, yet the Enemy have not been idle in fortifying this place, for they have flung up a Ditch on the out-side of the Trench, equally high with the Wall, so that although the Castle be of it self weak, yet the Fortifi∣cations about it are strong. The Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> is arrived with the <HI>Danish</HI> Forces at <HI>Carickfergus,</HI> whither his Grace the Duke of <HI>Schon∣berg</HI> is just now a going to see them, the <HI>Mary</HI> Yatcht has brought to <HI>Belfast</HI> a Boat that was going with eight Passengers from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Dub∣lin.</HI> The Army is now in a very good Condition, both as to Health, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and well provided with Provisins, and are most impatient for the Season of the Year in taking the Field.</P>
