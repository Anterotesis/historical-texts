<HEAD>A Brief TREATISE Of the Principal Fruits and Herbs That grow in Barbadoes, Jamaica, And other Plantations in the West-Indies. The First Part.</HEAD>
<P>THis short discourse of the Qua∣lities of the <HI>Fruits</HI> which that gallant Island of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> yields, I thought would not be im∣proper, as well for that I do not know that any has hitherto distinctly spoken thereof, as also because they being for
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
the most part the same with those pro∣duced, not only in the Western Plan∣tations, but also in <HI>Guinea,</HI> the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and most hot Countries, one and the same pains will serve to de∣scribe the Properties of them all; or at least to give such a general Philoso∣phical Account, that whatever you meet with in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Reigons neighbour∣ing to the Sun's more near and direct Beams, you may be well able by this Specimen, and from the Form, Taste, Colour, Smell and Signature of each Vegetable, to understand its Nature, Use and Operation.</P>
<P>In the first place, we must in general observe, that all Fruits in hot Climates are better, as being as by Nature pre∣pared to an higher degree of Maturity, than in Cold; for the Sun making his nearer visits with auspicious Beams, and an innocent and complemental Warmth both better disposes the Earth's teeming Womb, and by a most excellent Chymistry, refines the ripen∣ing Fruits from their gross dull phleg∣matick
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
Juices; Winter, Snows, Frosts and other Excesses, are there only re∣membred and talkt of, not known; and that Sol's too ardent kisses may not be offensive, Nature provides al∣ways delicate cooling Briezes and re∣freshing Gales of Wind, which not only relieve the Inhabitants from the ill effects of an excessive Heat, but much conduce to the melioration of the Fruits. Which being thus brought to its full and absolute perfection, be∣fore gathered, may much safer be eaten in those warm Countries, than in Cold, where they have not Sun enough to digest their Rawness into a Tempera∣ture so fit for Food. And as it is not fit for Man or Beast to labour so much and so hard in hot Regions, as in cold; therefore the wise Creator has by his Hand-maid Nature given them food prepared to their hands, that they might have no such need of Toiling, there being there no Winter to con∣sume what Summer brings forth, but a continued Spring or perpetual Harvest
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
of most excellent and never-failing Ve∣getations, some of the chief of which we shall proceed to speak of in parti∣cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Pine Apples.</HEAD>
<P>THis incomparable <HI>Fruit</HI> deser∣vedly claims precedency for its delicacy and excellency; for when full Ripe, its Taste is so exquisitly delight∣ful and pleasant, that it seems to exceed all others that the Earth produces; whence 'tis reported, that when some of them, by great care, and the favour of a speedy Voyage, were brought into <HI>England,</HI> (for very rarely can they be preserv'd so long) and presented to King <HI>Iames,</HI> he was so ravisht with its charming deliciousness, that he said, <HI>It was not fit to be tasted by a Subject, but only proper to Regale the Gusto of Princes, inured to the highest Delicacies.</HI> The four grand Qualities, whence all per∣fect Tastes do proceed, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>As∣tringent</HI> or <HI>Saltish,</HI> the <HI>Bitter,</HI> the <HI>Sweet</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
and the <HI>Sour</HI> are herein so equally mixt and compounded by Gods Hand-maid (Nature) that 'tis hard to distinguish which of them does predominate; but the truth is, the most delightful Mo∣derator and King of all Tastes, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Sweet</HI> doth a little exceed all the other three, so that there is nothing appears but an inviting Beauty, delight∣ful Redolency, and ravishing Taste, that feasts in the highest degree, all those Senses at once.</P>
<P>For it must be noted, That all the various and numberless Tastes of things, both in the <HI>Annimal, Vegetable,</HI> and <HI>Mineral Kingdoms</HI> do all proceed and arise from the four grand Qualities aforesaid, (at large described in my <HI>Way to Health,</HI> and <HI>The Good House-wife made a Doctor, &amp;c.</HI>) so that there are but four perfect Tastes, they being the Radix of all others, as the seven Notes are the Basis or Foundation of all Mu∣sical Harmony; and according to the Equality of those four, or the weak∣ness or predominancy of each, such a
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Taste does carry the upper dominion in all things, and accordingly is the same more or less grateful to the Pallate and Stomach, and homogeneal to the Body.</P>
<P>But though our Pines are one of the best sorts of Fruits in the world, they stand the Inhabitants of those parts, and the Eaters of them, but in very little stead, being by our English chiefly eaten after or betwixt Meals, to plea∣sure wanton Appetite and depraved Senses; for which cause their genuine nature and operation is hardly known to those that devour the most of them; however, their excellent Taste, plea∣sant Smell, and curious Shapes do de∣clare their noble Vertues, being either eaten alone, or with Bread on a well prepared Stomach; for they moderate, cool, comfort and refresh the Spirits, cleanse the Passages, remove Obstru∣ctions that fur the Pipes, and also purge away and help to digest all slimy and sharp Juices that offend Nature, being light of Concoction, and if eaten full
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Ripe, on an empty stomach, it power∣fully purgeth by Urine.</P>
<P>It makes a good breakfast or supper with the help of Bread, it being clean and easie, that the natural Heat can easily overcome and digest it at plea∣sure, and Bread does dry up the hu∣midity of the Fruit, and renders the Nourishment more firm. But note likewise, that this rare Fruit is only good <HI>Raw</HI> (as we usually, but impro∣perly call it) that without any other Preparation, than what Nature, and the Sun's digestive Heat gives it; and entire and alone (except only a little Bread eat with it) it is so compleat, that it will not admit of any alteration or composition, since they cannot add to its Vertues, or raise Nature to an higher degree, as in many other things may be done; but here, what-ever humane Art is used, or things inter∣mixt, it is still for the worse, because <HI>Nature</HI> (the Art of God) has already cook't it to the sublimest Perfection, it being the best and most fragrant
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Fruit the <HI>West-Indies</HI> do bring forth, most wholsom and healthy to be eaten now and then, <HI>viz.</HI> two or three times a week to make a Meal or part of a Meal with it; for the God of Eternal Wisdom hath appointed all things to be used with Sobriety, Temperance and Order, for which end he hath given all these brave comforts unto the Sons of men: This is a Fruit highly digni∣fied with Coelestial Energy, being un∣der the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> in the Sign <HI>Leo.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Plantains.</HEAD>
<P>THis is a brave noble Fruit, plea∣sant and grateful to the Senses, if not gathered till full ripen'd on the Trees, they afford a Nourishment of a middle nature, but not so quick nor brisk on the Pallate and Stomach, nor so easie of Concoction as <HI>Pines,</HI> because in these the <HI>Lunar</HI> Property does pre∣dominate, and the four Qualities or Tastes are not so equaliz'd; yet it must
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
be acknowledged a good and wholsom Fruit, especially for such as live easily, and work but little; for hard La∣bourers ought to have food that affords a Nourishment more firm and substan∣tial; and therefore such should eat Bread, or some other dry Food with them.</P>
<P>It is a general custom to gather them before they are ripe, and let them ripen off the Trees, which is both contrary to Reason and Nature; for thereby the purer brisk spirituous parts are as it were totally destroyed; so that the true lively Vertues and Sweetness be∣come of a dull heavy nauseous and un∣pleasant Taste, and harder of Con∣coction, affording a much worse Nou∣rishment. Nor is this Fruit good be∣ing any way prepar'd as by Art, tho' it be customary for many to make Tarts with them, and compound them with several Ingredients, which is not com∣mendable; for Nature has already advanced them to the highest degree, provided you let them alone long
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
enough, <HI>viz.</HI> till they are full Ripe; and all alteration then is for the worse, and not for the better. <HI>But the Women must be doing something, though it be Mischief, as Mother</HI> Eve <HI>has given them an Example.</HI></P>
<P>But if when 'tis full Ripe it be eaten temperately, either alone, or rather with some Bread, it is wholesom and profitable to Nature; but be ad∣vised not to eat them in wantonness on full Stomachs, or between Meals, as the custom of the English is, but not without great prejudice to Nature; for they are naturally a little▪ dull and heavy, and therefore they require a brisk Appetite and well prepared Stomach, and store of heat to concoct them. This Fruit is under the domi∣nion of the <HI>Moon,</HI> and the Sign <HI>Pisces</HI>; as to heat they are moderate, <HI>viz.</HI> rather cooling than hot; when full ripe they gently open Obstructions of the breast, being eaten with Bread in a Morning; but unripe they are bind∣ing, and if baked with Sugar, Spices,
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
and the like, lose their natural opera∣tion, and thereby become hot, and apt to obstruct the Passages, and tire the Appetite and Stomach, generate evil Juices, dull Spirits and thick Blood, and therefore so prepared are no commendable Food.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Bonnanoes.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a Fruit much of the nature with <HI>Plantains,</HI> but somewhat sweeter, or more Venereal, and easier of Con∣coction, very pleasant and delightful to the Pallate, Stomach, and Senses, Nature having likewise prepared this to the height, so that whatever alter∣ation <HI>Mrs. Housewife</HI> makes, proves improper and hurtful; the best way of eating them is like the rest before, either alone or with Bread; and so they cleanse, open and remove Obstru∣ctions, gently loosen the Belly, being of a middle Quality, neither hot nor cold in Excess; a Meal of them now and then will be not only grateful, but
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
also healthful; but if they are eaten green, or ripned off the Trees, then their nature and operations will be altogether contrary, and have many ill effects; for before Fruits arrive to their full Maturity, the <HI>Astringent, Bitter</HI> and <HI>Sowr Qualities</HI> do too vio∣lently predominate, and all such things must therefore prove hurtful to the Body; whereas when full ripe, the sweet balsamiak and pure spirituous Qualities do tincture the <HI>Saturnine</HI> and <HI>Martial Properties,</HI> and as it were cap∣tivate their poysonous fierce hot Na∣tures, that they can scarce be felt or tasted, the powers and vertues of <HI>Sol</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> being become more strong. Besides, ripening of Fruits off from the Trees is unnatural, and opposeth her method in the highest degree, as is before declared.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Cocoe-Nuts.</HEAD>
<P>THe Kernels of this Fruit are of a full strong sweet and delightful
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
Taste to the Pallate and Stomach, but apt to stop and fur the Passages, if eaten alone, or in Quantities. &amp; ut on the contrary, if Order and Temperance be observed, it makes a brave sublime Food, very profitable for all Ages and Constitutions, affording a clean pure Nourishment, easie of Digestion, breeds good Blood, and pure fine brisk Spirits. Besides, this Fruit contains a thin or milky Substance, of a Cordial nature, if eaten with some dry Food, as Bread, and the like. But neither this nor the Kernal is not to be eaten alone on full Stomachs, or between Meals, as English People are apt to do in all places where they come, ac∣counting nothing food but <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Fish</HI>; whereas <HI>Herbs, Seeds, Fruits</HI> and <HI>Grains</HI> do far transcend them, as to brave firm substantial Nourishment, as I have else-where in several Treatises demonstrated, <HI>viz.</HI> in my <HI>Way to Health, long Life and Happiness,—The good Housewife made a Doctor, &amp;c.</HI> These <HI>Cocoe-Fruits</HI> are under the <HI>Sun</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
and <HI>Venus,</HI> and the Coelestial sign <HI>Libra,</HI> but its outward shell or covering is <HI>Martial</HI> and <HI>Saturnine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovars.</HEAD>
<P>THis Fruit is under the dominion of the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> and the sign <HI>Scorpio</HI>; it hath its harsh Taste from Mars, its Sweetness from the Moon. If eaten unripe or green, then it binds the belly, but when full ripe, it is a good wholsom pleasant Fruit, may be eaten raw at Meals with bread and other food, as Milk, or the like: They are of a moderate cooling open∣ing Quality; but there are two sorts, one that are white within, and the other Red, which last are the best of the two.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Sour-Sopps.</HEAD>
<P>THis is a good Fruit, agreeable to the Stomach if full ripe, and it lie not too long after it be gathered
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
before it be eaten; it is endued with a grateful pleasant Taste, very easie of Concoction, if eaten moderately, espe∣cially with Bread, or some other dry food; if a Meal be so made now and then, it will prove very profitable to the breast, by cleansing and removing Obstructions that lie in those Passages; it also moderately cools and allays Drought, and gently loosens the belly, and if a Glass of White-Wine, allay'd with Water, be drank after it, or other proper Liquor, it will bravely cleanse the passages of the Uriters, and cause plentiful evacuation of Urine; but if they lie too long after gathering, before you use them, much of the good Qua∣lities and natural Vertues will be aba∣ted, and it will be apt to have a con∣trary operation; it is cold in Quality, and therefore proves most profitable to the <HI>Chollerick</HI> and <HI>Sanguine Complex∣ions,</HI> but not so good for <HI>Phlegmatick Bodies. Mercury</HI> and the <HI>Moon</HI> have dominion over it, and it is to be attri∣buted to the sign <HI>Taurus.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>Of Prickle-Pears.</HEAD>
<P>THis is a pleasant delightful Fruit, very grateful to Nature, and may with safety be eaten both in health and sickness, being easie of concoction, it quickly passeth away, digesting and moving the Obstructions that offend the Passages, if eaten on an empty Stomach, either alone or with Bread, or some other food, it is mo∣derately cooling, and good against the <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel,</HI> if eaten alone in a Morning when fasting, and a glass of White-Wine, allay'd with Water (<HI>viz.</HI> one third part Wine and two Water) drank after it. <HI>Mercury</HI> governs it, and the Sign <HI>Aries.</HI> But neither this nor any other fruit ought to be eaten in wantonness, nor for state or vain plea∣sure, as between Meals and after Din∣ner, our Creator never intending them for such uses, but for the support and health of mankind, and those that abuse them otherwise, commit a very
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>
great Evil, of which they ought to Repent, and forsake all such super∣fluities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Papaes.</HEAD>
<P>THis is an innocent, yet noble Fruit, of little Taste taken as it grows, and that which it hath not very delightful; but it hath a wonderful, and as it were, Paradisical and most ravishing. Vertue that internally lies hid, which being awakned and raised up by the skill of the good Housewife, and proper Ingredients, it makes va∣rious sorts of most delightful food, but more especially <HI>Pyes</HI> or <HI>Tarts,</HI> there being no other fruit in the West-Indies (nor perhaps else-where in the world) comparable for that purpose; for it hath no manifest Taste or Quality that does too manifestly predominate, (as most other fruits have, that are used for such foods) and thereby it is capable of being raised to what degree of taste or pleasantness the Cook or
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>
good Housewife pleases, by mixing and adding proper Ingredients, which can∣not be done with any fruits or things wherein any of the four Qualities do too violently over-rule; for such things as are unequal in their Properties or Qualifyings, or where unripe things are joyned with ripe, can very rarely be altered for the better. This fruit being so unparrallel'd a thing for the use aforesaid, the <HI>good Dames</HI> of the Western Plantations have no reason to desire or long after other improper Fruits or Mixtures; for this being aptly prepared and made into Tarts, may yield the nicest Pallates most ample satisfaction: It is under the dominion of the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> in the sign <HI>Taurus,</HI> but the <HI>Moon</HI> predo∣minating in its governance, hides the pleasant Qualities of <HI>Venus</HI>; but when other Ingredients are mixt with it, then the sleeping or captivated Vertues of <HI>Venus</HI> appear in their splendor or ravishing Tastes: They are of a cool∣ing opening Nature and Operation of
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>
themselves, but when mixed, are va∣ried according to the nature of the Ingredients. I know no other fruit in the West-Indies that can be altered to so good advantage as this. And as the <HI>Pine-Apple</HI> is the King of all Fruits to be eaten Raw; so on the other side this is the best and properest to be used in variation or further prepared.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Water Melons.</HEAD>
<P>THis is a most delicious <HI>Fruit,</HI> very pleasant and delightful both to sickly and healthy People; if eaten moderately 'tis very profitable for hot Chollerick Complexions, and such as are subject to be feaverish, or fumes flying into their Heads; 'tis of a cool∣ing cleansing Property, easie of Con∣coction, and dis-burthens the Passages of all gross offensive Matter, if eaten <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asting in a Morning with a little Bread; also, it powerfully cleanseth the Reins and Melancholly, purges by Urine, and therefore the frequent use
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>
of them moderates the astringent harsh Quality in such Constitutions as are liable to the <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel,</HI> for which it is one of the best Remedies in the World. But if you mix <HI>Sugar, Wine,</HI> or the like Ingredients, then you cannot perceive nor feel its ge∣nuine vertue or operation; for thereby its nature and effects are changed, just as a Painter does alter one Colour into another, by adding other Colours, which ought seriously to be consider∣ed by all Compounders of food or Me∣dicines, and the natural Reason to be well understood. This fruit is under the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> (but <HI>Luna</HI> hath the greatest share in Government) in the sign <HI>Libra,</HI> whence it is that they gallantly purge by Urine. There are two sorts, Red and White, but the Red are the best.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Musk-Melons.</HEAD>
<P>THere are two sorts of these, one about as big as our ordinary
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>
Pumkins, the other smaller, not much bigger than those in <HI>England</HI>; of the two, this last sort are the best, though the other are very good in their kind, and to be preferred before any our Northren Climate produces. The best way of eating them is with Salt and Bread, which renders them more warming and grateful to the Stomach; nor do they gripe, except it be for want of the bodies being used to them. They gently loosen the belly, and moderately purge by Urine, if eaten for a breakfast with a glass or two of White-Wine, or White-Wine and Water mixt▪ or plain Water drank after them: They may be eaten by all Ages and Constitutions, but are best for young People, and espe∣cially for Chollerick hot Complexions; for they allay drought, and gently cool the whole body, but they may not be often eaten as food, because they af∣ford not so firm a Nourishment, but between whiles it will be very profit∣able to make a whole Meal of them now &amp; then with only Bread and Salt.</P>

<HEAD>Of Pumkins.</HEAD>
<P>PUmkins that grow in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> are much of the nature of those we have here with us in <HI>England,</HI> but not altogether so cold, being brought to an higher degree of Maturity by the powerful Influences of the Sun-beams, who caress them with nearer Embraces; yet still, this Fruit is of a cold phlegmatick Nature, but eaten stew'd with warming Ingre∣dients, makes an indifferent good food, taking store of Bread therewith, its Nourishment is not firm, but easie of concoction, loosens the belly, is not proper for cold phlegmatick Com∣plexions, but very profitable to be used now and then by the Chollerick: It also gently purgeth by Urine, as indeed most of the fruits in the West-Indies do; and 'tis a great Error in our Nor∣thren People, settled in those parts, especially such as are obnoxious to the <HI>Stone, Gravel,</HI> and the like, that they
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>
do not accustom themselves more to the use of those noble fruits; for if they did, they would not be so subject to those torturing Diseases as they are; for all foods, be they fruits or other things, and also Drinks, that moder∣ately cool the body, and are of light concoction, do naturally prevent the generation of those cruel Diseases; as on the other side, such as heat, and are of an astringent nature, do generate them in all Complexions, but especial∣ly in those that are inclinable there∣unto. The Coelestial Regiment of this fruit is to be attributed to the <HI>Moon,</HI> and to the sign <HI>Pisces.</HI></P>

<P>LImes are an Immature Fruit, in which two extream Properties do predominate, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Saturnal</HI> and <HI>Martial Poysons,</HI> because the Sun and Coelestial Influences, have not had Power to raise or awaken the balsa∣mick or friendly Vertues of Nature, or bring the Properties into an equal operation, as is done in other Fruits; for these two fierce Qualities are so powerful, as indeed being the very
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>
Radix of the Fruit, that the friendly Property or good Vertue is wholly hid or captivated by them, so that it cannot be tasted or felt; hence the Juice of this fruit does contain (as I have else∣where declared) a <HI>Saturnine</HI> churlish fire, which is of an hard coagulating astringent or binding nature and oper∣ation, like the raw cold saturnine Air of Winter, which does congeal the Water, and harden all things. 2<HI>dly.</HI> A sharp keen Martial Property, of a sour harsh fretting nature and opera∣tion.

<P>For this cause, our English, and

Moreover the sharp cold Juices of <HI>Oranges</HI> and <HI>Lemmons,</HI> which in hot Countries they are greedy of, and do eat too freely, do prove very pernicious as to their Health; for the truth is, it is not the Climate, whether hot or cold, that causes so many Dis∣eases, but Peoples Intemperances and taking wrong Measures; for the Na∣tives both of the <HI>East, South</HI> and <HI>West</HI> are as healthy and long liv'd as those of the <HI>North</HI>; and these our frequent Distempers when we travel into those parts, do but declare our Intempe∣rances, and that the Meats and Drinks we so much desire are not proper for our Bodies in such Climates, where not our own irregular Fancies, but the usages of the Natives of each Country ought to be our Guides and

<P>OF this there are two sorts, one great the other small; but both

are much of the same nature and oper∣ation, only the smallest is rather the hottest. They both contain three extream Qualities; <HI>viz.</HI> 1. An astrin∣gent Sulpher, or stupifying Poyson from <HI>Saturn</HI>; 2. A fierce bitter keen sharpness from <HI>Mars</HI>; And 3. An hot penetrating Poyson from <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P>In this Vegetation all friendliness and pure Vertues are captivated, and the original forms of Nature do pre∣dominate, there being in it no kind of Equality or Harmony, but all is out of Tune, and the four <HI>grand Qualities,</HI> whence all Tastes proceed, have here their operations in Discord, and con∣fusedly combate one another; there∣fore whatever any may pretend, the frequent eating of it must needs prove pernicious to Health; for those fore∣mentioned fierce poysonous Qualities do by degrees as it were insensibly prey upon and violate the natural Heat, and hinders the way of the Spirits, as if men designed to mortifie their natural Legs, on purpose to use Wooden ones
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>
or Crutches; so they destroy the ge∣nuine innate heat of their Stomachs, and vainly endeavour to procure a false and adventitious one, that may better (forsooth) supply Nature. The truth is, this hot fiery Sawce does powerful∣ly stir up or beget Appetite, and warms the Stomach, which does intice many to eat it with their common food, but they never consider the mischiefs it brings unto Health, being like <HI>Brandy,</HI> a dram of which after a full Meal of heavy Victuals, will help Concoction, and ease the burthened Stomach, but the frequent use of it will so destroy the natural Heat, that the Stomach will not be able, after a little time, to digest its food, neither with it nor without it: So this Spice being too much eaten, wounds Nature to the very Heart; for by degrees it debilitates the proper Heat, infects the Blood with a salt sharp keen Quality, partches up and consumes the sweet Oyl and Radical Moisture, suffocates the pure Spirits by whole-sale, causing
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>
the <HI>Blood</HI> (their limpid Fountain and natural habitation) to become wheyish and watery. Especially, if <HI>Chollerick</HI> or <HI>Sanguine Complexion'd People</HI> shall accustom themselves to the eating of such Sawces, it will much sooner and more deplorably vitiate the <HI>Tone</HI> of their Stomachs, than of such as are <HI>Pleg∣matick</HI>; but they are not good nor natural for any whatsoever, except now and then in a Physical way for very cold dull heavy <HI>Phlegmatick People,</HI> and they must eat it sparingly too; but the mischief is, whoever shall accustom themselves to these Sawces, cannot forbear from Excess therein, without great trouble and constraint upon themselves: The very same is to be understood of all other Extreams, as <HI>Brandy, Tobacco,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Besides, all such things are far more pernicious, and bring greater danger to Health in hot Countries, than in colder Climates, as many have found by woful Experience, because there the central Heat is nothing so strong
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>
and powerful as in colder Regions, and consequently the pure Spirits and Radical Moisture weaker, and more apt to be wounded, suffocated or eva∣porated, as all do know that have Eyes that can see into the <HI>Arcana of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our <HI>Guinea-Pepper,</HI> it is such an Extream in Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> so hot and poysonous, that if the bigger sort be dryed, and the Cods cut and the Seeds scattered amongst Clothes, Hats, or the like, that are to be packt up, it proves the best Preservative from the Moth, and other Vermine that is known; for its excessive keenness de∣stroys all Generation, even in the very bud. Likewise, if it be burnt in a Room, the Doors and Windows being close shut, it will destroy and kill all <HI>Buggs, Fleas,</HI> or the like, and you too, if you do not get out in time, its fumes are so hot, poysonous and penetrating, when once the fire has open'd its body, and manifested what before internally lay hid.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="23"/>This bigger sort our English do commonly pickle, and so preserve it for a common Sawce to eat with <HI>Flesh:</HI> Now this pickling of it with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Vinegar</HI> does still add to its heat and sharpness; For <HI>Salt</HI> is of an hot harsh sharp Nature, and if it be not mode∣rately eaten, dries, heats and is of a partching operation, very inimical to Health, but a Ring-leader to the <HI>Scur∣vey</HI> and other Diseases, and <HI>Vinegar</HI> is also of an hot keen fretting Nature, especially when joyned or incorpo∣rated with such high fires and things of unequal Natures: Therefore the frequent use of this sort of Swace is to be accounted very injurious to Health, especially in such hot Climates, where the continual influences of the <HI>Sun</HI> do more exhale and draw forth the Radical Moisture, thereby weakning the central parts, which ought there∣fore rather to be refresht and cherisht by proper Foods, than annoyed and prejudiced by such hot violent things, as do yet further depress and debilitate them.</P>

The excellency of this Herb does chiefly reside in the dis∣tasteful or bitter Quality, which at first eating is somewhat unpleasant, but a little custome will make it friend- and more delightsom than others that are less bitter; for all Herbs are the most grateful to the Stomach, and ea∣siest of Digestion, in which the Bitter Quality or Taste is a little predomi∣nant, for this property is lively, and the cause of Motions quick and pene∣trating;

<PB N="49" REF="26"/>
Climate or by reason of the unusual Heats, People there are not so long-liv'd as in the more cold <HI>Northren</HI> parts of the World; and for this they appeal to Experience; <HI>Do not we see</HI> (say they) <HI>how men are cut off by Diseases in the prime of their Years, and very few attain to old Age?</HI> Whence 'tis a common Proverb amongst them, <HI>Soon Ripe, Soon Rotten,</HI> as if this were the very Nature of the Climate; but this is all Mistake; they blame the Climate, when themselves are only to blame: 'Tis their own Intemperance, not that of the Heavens, which shortens their days: The wise and merciful God hath ordered so providentially all parts of this habitable World, that his Creature [<HI>Man</HI>] may thereon live comfortably, if he please: 'Twas the Error of the Antients when they divided the Earthly Globe into five <HI>Zones,</HI> to imagine two of them un∣inhabitable, one of which they called the <HI>Frigid Zone,</HI> through excessive Cold, and the other <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="27"/>
through extreamity of Heat. But Experience has confuted their guessing Philosophy, and shews us, that both these are commodious enough to dwell in, if Discretion and Sobriety be used; Is one Region cold? God has given its Inhabitants strong Constitutions, great Stomachs, gross suitable Food, and Furze wherewith to defend them. Is another very hot? Here are refresh∣ing Briezes constantly imployed by Nature, to fan and divert them, rare delicate Fruits, easie of Digestion, to supply all the necessities of Nature, and support them in Strength and Health. But such is the Perversity of men, that being depraved by custom, they pursue and take quite contrary measures to those that Nature dictates, and in the hottest Climates gorge themselves with the grossest Foods, various Dishes of <HI>Flesh, Fish</HI> and <HI>Fowls,</HI> whereof they daily eat to Gluttony, and the strongest Liquors, as <HI>Madera Wines, Brandy</HI> and <HI>Punch</HI>; so that where they need the least, finest and
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>
lightest Meats and Drinks, they cloy and oppress Nature with the grossest and strongest; And is it any wonder that they are then afflicted with Dis∣eases, or cut off by immature Deaths? If a man will turn the top of his Candle downwards, and extinguish it by ex∣cess of Tallow, how unjustly does such an one blame the Winds for putting out its light?</P>
<P>The sweet Influences of the Coele∣stials, and especially the heat of Hea∣ven's bright Eye (the Sun) does in hot Countries prepare all sorts of Ve∣getations and Fruits, so as that they become more wholsom and proper for the Body, than in colder Regions, thereby pointing out which is the most natural food in such Climates; of which the Natives (though by us esteemed <HI>Barbarous</HI>) are so wise as to take notice; for they in most hot Countries do more incline to eat <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> (though not so much as they ought, nor do they prepare many of them so well as they should) yet

thereby, and by being strangers to Riot and Intemperance, they retain an undisturbed Health to very great Ages; So in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where the food is chiefly <HI>Herbs, Fruits</HI> and <HI>Grains,</HI> and their Drink only <HI>Water,</HI> to meet with Persons of <HI>One Hundred Years of Age,</HI> is common; nay, it is credibly reported, that some of those called <HI>Brachmans,</HI> who do wholly abstain from eating either <HI>Flesh</HI> or <HI>Fish</HI> do lengthen out their days to <HI>One Hundred and Twenty,</HI> and <HI>One Hundred and Fifty Years</HI>: And in <HI>Guinea,</HI> tho' it be a very hot Country, and generally the Constitution of the Air accounted very unwholsom, yet you shall see the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> frequently live <HI>One Hundred and Twenty Years</HI> in great strength and vigour.

For Prodi∣gious in the Excess they commit, such as cannot rationally be imagined of any that had not a mind willfully to destroy themselves: for to omit their Extravagances in ordinary Diet, the vast Quantities of <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Fish</HI> which they unnecessarily devour, I have heard it credibly related and affirmed, That there has been the Quantity of <HI>One Thousand</HI> or <HI>One Thousand Two Hundred</HI> Bottles of <HI>Wine, Madera</HI> and <HI>Claret,</HI> consumed at one Feast, made by a common Plantes of <HI>Barbadoes</HI>; and that the like Superfluity (as if they would vye for Luxury with the old <HI>Romans,</HI> in the declining Age of their Empire) is not infrequent in that and other <HI>Western Plantations.</HI></P>
<P>Now let all the World judge, if men will thus seek Death in the Errors of their Lives, how is the Country to be complained of? He that takes his share of three or four such Treats, will have little reason to accuse the heat of
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>
the Weather for casting him into a <HI>Feaver.</HI> If our English, and others, that travel to and live in those <HI>Westenr, Eastern</HI> or <HI>Southern Regions</HI> would be but so obedient to Nature, and kind to themselves as to observe a proper Order and right Method of Living, they would not only live long, but healthy. And for their furtherance and benefit therein (I mean, such as have not absolutely forsworn hearken∣ing to any Remonstrances of Reason, nor betrothed themselves to Madness and ruinating Debauchery) I shall here add a few general Rules or Di∣rections for the Preservation of Health, very necessary to be regarded by all such as live in <HI>Hot Climates.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Flesh</HI> ought not to be eaten at all, or very sparingly; for <HI>Flesh</HI> in hot Countries is nothing so firm, good and wholsom as in cold (though the eating thereof may well be spared in both) but on the other side, <HI>Herbs, Roots</HI> and most <HI>Fruits</HI> are abundantly
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>
more excellent for Food in hot Cli∣mates than in Cold; The same is to be understood by <HI>Fish,</HI> as experience has taught the <HI>Natives</HI> of all such places, who therefore do more incline to eat <HI>Herbs, Fruits</HI> and <HI>Vegetations</HI>; and for want of this Prudence, have not many of our <HI>Northern People</HI> after a full Meal of <HI>Flesh</HI> or <HI>Fish</HI> in those hot parts, been suddenly surprized with various cruel Diseases, as <HI>Feavers, Fluxes,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Full</HI> and <HI>Liberal Eating</HI> of any sort of Food, proves of more danger∣ous consequence to Health, especially if the Foods be gross, fat and succulent, because the natural and central Heat is by the great Power of the Coelestial Influences continually exhaled, and so becomes more external, which does in a degree debilitate the Digestive Facul∣ty; for which cause a mans Stomach and Appetite is rarely so sharp and strong as in cold Countries.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="56" REF="30"/>3. <HI>Great Drinking,</HI> especially of strong exhilerating Liquors, as <HI>Wine, Brandy,</HI> or other <HI>Spirits,</HI> is very per∣nicious; for all such Drinks, if not cautiuosly used, and well allay'd with <HI>Water,</HI> proves of fatal consequence, and wounds Nature to the very heart, as daily Experience does testifie, and doth sooner destroy Health than in cold Countries, though bad in both. I know this is contrary to the <HI>Vulgar Notions,</HI> but it is agreeable to <HI>Truth, Experience</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI>; only People, by a vitious Inclination, had a mind to debauch themselves with strong Li∣quors, and the Devil, to humor them, suggested that such Liquors <HI>(forsooth!)</HI> were necessary, and most to be used in hot Countries; and so they got a colour for their Excess, and continue the Maxime and now plead, <HI>They must be Drunk if they mean to be Healthy, &amp;c.</HI> But <HI>Nature,</HI> as well as <HI>Christianity,</HI> will read them another Lesson; for in hot Climates, the natural or central
<PB N="57" REF="30"/>
Heat being not so strong, by reason of the forcible Influences of the Sun, powerfully exhaling the Radical Moi∣sture, opening the Pores, and too vio∣lently evaporating the Spirits, the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Digestive Faculty</HI> thereby become weak, and the inclination to drinking is encreased; for which rea∣son many desire hot spirituous Drinks, finding a present Refreshment; for such Liquors do powerfully awaken the internal or central Spirits by <HI>Simile,</HI> which makes the Drinkers quick, lively and brisk, during the time of their operation, which is but for a Moment, but afterwards they find themselves heavy, dull and in∣disposed, their Stomach more feeble, cold and raw than before, which in∣clines them to take t'other Dram; and still, the more the worse, till Nature be debilitated to the utmost Extremity. The same operation have all <HI>Wines</HI> and other Drinks, if Temperance be wanting, but not so violently as the former; therefore in all hot Climates
<PB N="58" REF="31"/>
there ought to be double the care and temperance, as in cold, both in <HI>Meats, Drinks</HI> and <HI>Exercises</HI>; of which, the Natives of hot Countries may be our Examples; for they do, for the most part live temperately, their Drink <HI>Water,</HI> or <HI>Wine allay'd with Water</HI>; their Food mean, or more simple and innocent than ours, whereby they are better preserved in Health; the Con∣stitutions of all People in hot Climates being not so able to bear or endure <HI>great Meals</HI> and <HI>superfluous Drinking</HI> of strong Liquors, as in cold. There∣fore most of those that in such places accustom themselves to the frequent use of those <HI>strong spirituous fiery Drinks,</HI> and the common course of gorman∣dizing on <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Fish,</HI> become very obnoxious to the <HI>Dry Belly-Ake,</HI> or <HI>Griping of the Guts, Dropsies</HI> and the <HI>Gout.</HI> For all such Foods and Drinks too violently stir up and consume the natural Heat and Moisture, whereby the digestive Faculty of the Stomach is rendred uncapable to concoct or
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>
make any perfect seperation, whereby the body grows oppressed with a <HI>Mass of Crudities</HI> and <HI>noxious Iuices,</HI> that sometimes fall into the Joynts, infee∣bling and tormenting them; and this is the original of that Rich Evil, call'd, The <HI>Gout.</HI> In other Complexions these and the like Disorders prey upon the sollid parts, and waste the <HI>Flesh,</HI> taking away natural strength and vigour; so that such Persons pine and languish under such a load of daily in∣gested Aliment; for nothing is more usual in Nature, than for Extreams to generate or occasion each other, and these you call <HI>Consumptions.</HI> In others, for want of Heat and Moisture the Excrement in the Bowels, is con∣tracted into so hard a substance, that it cannot freely pass; and this is that which the learned call, <HI>The Illiacal Passion,</HI> and the Vulgar, <HI>The Plague in the Guts,</HI> for which most cruel Dis∣ease there is scarce a Doctor that hath yet found out a certain Remedy.</P>
<P>Now in these our <HI>Western Planta∣tions</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>
all these tormenting Diseases are much encreased by the frequent Tip∣pling of that pernicious Drink called <HI>Punch,</HI> the Nature and effects of which I have herein before hinted, but more fully demonstrated in my Treatise, entituled, <HI>The Country-Man's Companion,</HI> pag. 110.</P>
<P>In some other Constitutions the central Heat and <HI>Humor Radicalis</HI> be∣ing wasted by such unfit Meats and Drinks so received, is turn'd into a flux of Humors, both windy and watery, which swells the lower parts of the body; and this is the generation of your <HI>Dropsies.</HI></P>
<P>But as the Lord our bountiful Crea∣tor is always good, and his Hand-maid (Nature) an indulgent Mother; so they have, as it were, chalked out the means of preventing these Evils, and prescribed proper Diet and Drinks in every Country and Climate to its In∣habitants, by the natural Productions of each respective Region, would men be so wise to follow those Dictates;
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>
for all hot Climates, (as is before intimated) do furnish their In∣habitants with wonderful variety and plenty of brave noble, and most fra∣grant <HI>Herbs, Fruits, Roots</HI> and <HI>Grains,</HI> and most pure <HI>Water,</HI> far exceeding those of cold Countries, both in Quan∣tity and Quality; for in those hot Re∣gions, Heaven's bright Lamp, that central Fire of the Universe, the <HI>SVN,</HI> has greater power, strength and vertue to fit and prepare all things for our use; and if our English, and others, would be so prudent as to accustom themselves to those harmless natural simple Food and moderate Drinks, then the fore-mentioned Distempers would hardly be known amongst them.</P>
<P N="4">4. They ought likewise to have re∣gard to the proper <HI>Times</HI> of their ea∣ting, or Meals, that is to say, to eat about <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine a Clock in the Morning,</HI> and then again at <HI>Four</HI> or <HI>Five 'ith Afternoon</HI>; for the common
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
time of Dinner about <HI>Twelve</HI> or <HI>One,</HI> is neither Rational nor Natural, be∣cause the <HI>Sun</HI> is then near the Meridi∣an, and doth then so powerfully draw forth, exhale, and weaken the Natu∣ral and Centeral heat of the Stomach, that it indisposes the whole Body, more than at any other time of the day, so that then Nature is not so well able to perform her <HI>Kitchin-work</HI> in the Stomach, by a perfect Concoction or Separation of the Meats and Drinks, and so all the Senses are dulled, and the Intellect stupified, and not a few seeds of diseases are thereby sown through∣out the Body. Besides the long Morn∣ings Work or Exercise, has by that time pretty much wearied, dulled, or eva∣porated the brisk lively Spirits, which are alwayes the main supports of Con∣coction and Digestion, and so Nature is still rendred the more uncapable of doing her work with ease. But in the Morning, after Nocturnal Repose has recovered the wasted Spirits, and made them Brisk, Airy, and full of
<PB N="63" REF="33"/>
Life, the digestive faculty is fortified, and rendred able to digest the same quantity of Food, with much more ease and safety. The same is to be understood in the Afternoon, or to∣wards Night, for then the heat of the day being over, and the Body becomes Cool, Airy, and full of Life, and be∣ing a sufficient time before sleep, as at <HI>Four</HI> or <HI>Five</HI> a Clock, such Suppers will not Incommode Nature, nor hin∣der Rest, as late eating is apt to do, especially in hot Countries, and still the more in maturer Age, or such as begin to be striken in years, to whom such Meals are most injuri∣ous.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such as have due regard to their Health and Strength, ought for the reasons aforesaid to <HI>Rest</HI> from <HI>Elea∣ven</HI> a Clock till <HI>Two</HI> in the Afternoon, which will wonderfully recover their Spirits, and render them much better able to go through with their Labour with a lively Vigour, and to do more

preparation of each of them; toge∣ther with the Nature and Operation of various drinks, as most sorts of <HI>Wine, Ale, Beer, Syder,</HI> each spoken to di∣stinctly by themselves, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. They ought to avoid the frequent eating and drinking of all Foods or Li∣quors in which the <HI>Sweet</HI> Quality is too highly predominant; for sweet Foods are of far more dangerous con∣sequence as to Health, than most Peo∣ple imagin; for all Sweet things when fermented in the Stomach do turn to the highest <HI>Sowerness,</HI> viz. into a keen sharpness, which does not only spoil the digestive faculty, but infects the Blood with a Mangie, Scorbutick Hu∣mour, causing stoppages in all the ex∣ternal parts, whence proceed Indispo∣sitions, and akeing Loyns, and feeble Joynts. For the same cause it is, that such as eat much <HI>Sugar</HI> or sweet food, are extreamly troubled with rotten de∣cay'd Teeth and Gumes; for those dullified foods cause such a sour acid
<PB N="67" REF="34"/>
<HI>Quality</HI> as generates putrifaction, which centers on the Teeth and between the Gumes, and so destroys them: And it were far better and more healthy for People, if they would accustom them∣seves to Foods and Drinks in which the Bitter and Sower Qualities were more predominant, especially in hot Climates where most sorts of Fruits are sweet∣ish, for the Root of all Motion, Open∣ing and Cleansing, consists in the Bit∣ter Quality; for which reason the <HI>Sophys</HI> or <HI>Wise-men,</HI> both of the <HI>Sou∣thern</HI> and <HI>Eastern</HI> Countries have taught the People to moderate all or most of their foods with <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> that are of a <HI>Bitterish Quality,</HI> which does wonderfully support Nature and pre∣serve Health, whereby they attain to very great Ages, as we noted before of those in <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the same may be observed elsewhere; for those Patriarchs whose Longevity we find Recorded, did all of them live in very hot Coun∣tries: But their Temperance support∣ed Nature, and so it will (in a propor∣tionable
<PB N="68" REF="35"/>
degree) all that practice it. And therefore if these Rules of Health be seriously regarded and followed, those causeless scandals on the Climate, the Heat, &amp;c. of these happy <HI>Western, Southern</HI> and <HI>Eastern</HI> Regions (not in∣ferior for Health or Pleasantness (if rightly understood) to any in the World) will cease, and the English Traders or Inhabitants may there ex∣tend their lives in Comfort to as good an old Age, as they would have pro∣mised themselves in their Native Coun∣try: But without Discretion and Tem∣perance in <HI>Diet, Drinks, Exercises</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> of the mind, Diseases will certainly attend us, wherever we re∣side; and an immature Death be apt to seize us: There is no Region so happy, no Elevation of the Pole so temperate, no Air so salubrious, as to keep People in Health whether they will or no, and those that obstinately violate Nature, and wilfully persue courses absolutely destructive, may justly be rank't amongst the number of
<PB N="69" REF="35"/>
<HI>Self-Murtherers</HI>; for it matters not much whether a man kill himself <HI>all at once,</HI> or by repeated Acts <HI>and degrees,</HI> only the <HI>latter</HI> seems <HI>less excuseable,</HI> since it has not the pretext of a sudden Temp∣tation or Passion, but seems a more de∣liberate design of destroying both his Body and Soul, against all Cautions and Arguments from time to time of∣fered to him, both by Reason and Expe∣rience to the contrary: Those there∣fore that would avoid the Brand of be∣ing <HI>Felo's-de-se,</HI> let them before it be too late abandon <HI>Riot</HI> and <HI>Excess,</HI> and embrace <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Sobriety,</HI> so shall they have <HI>Health</HI> of Body and <HI>Strength</HI> of mind, and <HI>length</HI> of dayes here, and a <HI>blissful Eternity</HI> hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>A Caution.</HEAD>
<P>LEt no sober well minded men, nor any that profess the honour∣able name of Christianity be so fre∣quent in those places of Debauchery, viz, <HI>Taverns</HI> and <HI>Ale-houses,</HI> the first
<PB N="70" REF="36"/>
whereof being the only places of all manner of wickedness, where all the high lofty state of Superfluity is practi∣sed, being the haunts of evil Spirits, and where their chief work is done, Women are defloured, and Estates spent, the Soul made uncapable of Salvation, the Health destroyed; in a word, the whole <HI>Macrocosmical</HI> man ruined, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he very Radix of devil∣ish Fewds and cruel Murders: There∣fore let no good Christians dare to be seen in any such places; for tell me, I pray, what pleasure or delight can a sober well-minded man take in being amongst such a devilish Croud, where there is all kinds of wicked lewd Be∣haviour, as <HI>Swearing, Lying, baudy Songs, drunken Healths,</HI> and <HI>roaring Huzza's,</HI> where a man can hardly hear himself spake, like the fiery unequal operations of the Elements, or Sea-Tempests and Storms. Now if Christi∣an men scruple the wearing of need∣less O naments and Garments, with other things of Gallantry and State,
<PB N="71" REF="36"/>
wherefore should they not shun and avoid the greater Evils: And although it be lawful to drink <HI>Wine</HI> in a <HI>Tavern,</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> in an <HI>Ale-house,</HI> in cases of ne∣cessity, as Travelling or the like, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they ought in Cities and Towns to avoid drinking or frequenting such places, whereby you will discounte∣nance the Evils thereof, and pre∣serve your selves Harmless and In∣nocent.</P>
<P N="2">2. All sober People ought to refrain drinking between Meals, especially all <HI>Gentlemen, Merchants, Shop-keepers,</HI> &amp;c. who are the men that drink the brave noble exhilerating Liquors in Superfluity; which a little custom would make most pleasant and easie; besides, it would free the Passages, and disburthen the Stomach from all su∣perfluous matter, by which the Blood would become fine, and cause it to cir∣culate freely, whence will proceed pure brisk lively Spirits, which will also render the whole Body and Mind
<PB N="72" REF="37"/>
lightsom, Strong and Healthy; be∣sides it would cut off all Superfluity and Wantonness in the bud, and gain time, which being well improved be∣comes a great Blessing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Not only abstaining from <HI>Wine</HI> ought to be minded but also in Foods, great care must be observed; for those People that live mostly upon clean in∣nocent Foods, are brisker, more light∣som and Airy, and their minds better disposed, and there does naturally arise in them Praises and Thanks to God for what they have, be it never so mean, As I remember one assured me, that after a little time of living on mean Foods, was more apt to give praise in his Heart to God, for a piece of Bread, than before for the highest delicacies.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whensoever any Persons of Quality, or men of Estates shall in private Quarrels commit Murder, or kill a man; if the Friends of this
<PB N="73" REF="37"/>
Murderer shall obtain a Pardon from the Prince or Governour of the place or Country, then let it be a custom for his whole Estate (if Childless) to be forfeited and given to the Poor, and a good part of it to the use and Children of the killed Person; but if the Mur∣derer have Children, then but one half of his Estate. By which means in a few years there would be yearly Reve∣nues for the <HI>Poor, Old, Blind</HI> and <HI>Lame</HI> of most Countries and Cities; besides, it would in some degree put a stop to such vile Practices, and render such Savages uncapable of commit∣ting the like offence for the future.</P>

given him dominion and government, not only over the inferior Creatures, but also over each other, in <HI>Clemency</HI> and <HI>Well-doing</HI>; but instead thereof he hath turned away the Eye of his Mind from thy Counsels, and hath precipitated his Imagination into the Centre of Wrath and Fierceness, there∣by defaming his Noble Birth, and depraving that innocent Paradisical Estate he was created in: So that whereas he was made a sociable Crea∣ture and intended for the well-order∣ing of the inferior Beings, and the help and comfort of those of his own Species by mutural Acts of Benove∣lence, Courtesie and Charity; he is now become a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> a <HI>Plague,</HI> a <HI>professed Enemy, Hunter, Betrayer, De∣stroyer</HI> and <HI>Devourer</HI> of all the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Earth, Air</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> and to those of his own kind no less fierce and cruel; so instead of <HI>cherishing, assisting,</HI> and <HI>relieving</HI> one another, they fight and tear each other like <HI>Tygers,</HI> and he is the bravest Fellow that can

Nor is this only amongst us, and those People called <HI>Heathens,</HI> but even those who call themselves by thy Name, and boast the Title of <HI>Christians,</HI> are no less active in these Exploits and Practices than any other.</P>
<P>We find and feel by sad Experience the fatal consequences of this Apo∣stacy from the Dignity of the humane Nature: We had never been snatcht from the Lands of our Nativity▪ never travers'd Liquid Mountains, nor journied through the Hazards of vast Seas, to be cast away on Land; never been brought in Fetters into new Worlds, nor made perpetual Slaves in Regions which neither we nor our fore-Fathers ever heard of before, if we had not first forsaken and violated

that Law of our Creator which he had planted in us, and entred with our Wills into the Root of <HI>Bitterness</HI> and the <HI>fierce Wrath,</HI> whereby the <HI>Savage Nature</HI> got the dominion in the hearts of us, and our Ancestors, so that <HI>Fury, Revenge, Covetousness, Pride, vain Glory</HI> and <HI>Intemperance</HI> is never satisfied; Hence <HI>Fewds</HI> and <HI>Wars</HI> are set on foot in our Native Countries, and those that are strongest and most numerous, kill, slay and murder the other at their pleasure; and as for those that they save alive, 'tis not out of pity or kindness, but to gratifie their own Covetousness, by making Mer∣chandize of them, and exposing them to <HI>Slavery,</HI> far worse than Death.</P>

Thus are we sometimes driven many Miles by Land over partching Deserts, and through howling Wilder∣nesses, down to the Sea-Coasts, and and Factories being all the way miser∣ably <HI>abus'd</HI> by our unmerciful Drivers, and wearied and spent with <HI>Over-Travel, Hunger, Drought</HI> and <HI>excessive Heat</HI>▪ which puts a period to many of our sweet Lives; but the same, when it happens, is reckoned an happiness; for thereby that greater and long last∣ing Misery is prevented, which those that survive must endure; for no sooner are they arrived at the Sea-side but they are sold (like Beasts) to the Merchant, who glad of the booty puts us aboard the Ship, claps us under Deck, and binds us in Chains and Fetters, and thrusts us into the <HI>dark noisom Hold,</HI> so many and so close together, that we can hardly breathe, there are we in the hottest of Summer, and under that scorching Climate without any of the sweet Influences of the Air, or briezing Gale to refresh

<P>Nay, many times not only our pro∣fest Enemies, but our Treacherous Friends betray us to these intollerable Miseries; for so far is the Root of bit∣terness irritated, and such an Ascen∣dent it hath got over us, that for vain trifles our paltry Parents, shall sell their Children, and Husbands their Wives into perpetual Slavery; Nor let any Christian Tyrants for this upbraid us; for if it be (as in truth it is) a most unnatural wickedness in our People to sell them, is it not upon the matter al∣most as bad in the Christians to buy them?

<P>Whilst we are thus mew'd up in the Ship, besides the inconveniencies of heat, and danger of suffocation, and the Torture of our Chains, we also run the hazard of being half star∣ved; for the Ship-Masters out of Co∣vetousness, and for their own Lucre, will not allow us fit or competent Meats or Drinks, but just enough to keep Life and Soul together, and that corrupt, decayed stinking and un∣wholsome, by which all our Healths and Lives are destroyed or impaired; for oft times half or more of our wretched Number dye in the Voyage, and others of us, of more sturdy Spirits and Tempers, when they see them∣selves thus Captiv'd, scorning to pre∣serve a Life that thenceforth would be only advantagious to others, and bur∣thensome to them, by refusing all Sustenance, have shortened their dayes.</P>

<P>Alas! we expected another sort of Treatment from the Christians, who

boast themselves the Sons and Favou∣rites of the God of Love and Goodness, and who (we have been informed) are, or ought to be endued with the Spirit of Meekness, Innocency, <HI>and do∣in unto all as they would be done unto.</HI> We understand that to be a Christian is to live under the Government of the Di∣vine Principle of <HI>Benignity</HI> and <HI>Well-doing,</HI> from whence all good Vertues are deriv'd, as streams from a Foun∣tain: But verily we find little, very little, or scarce any sign at all of this excellent Spirit to reign in the hearts of our Masters or Overseers; but on the contrary, find them over-ruled and filled with Devilishness, Cruelty and Oppression, which are so extream that we can as hardly bear them, as the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> of Old could the grievous and unreasonable Burthens of <HI>Egyptian, Pharoah,</HI> and his <HI>Task-masters,</HI> which did force them to cry unto the Lord for ease and deliverance from those cruel Bonds and Slaveries, even as we do at this day.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="44"/>To enumerate the miseries we en∣dure by a particular Bill of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, would be too tedious, we shall In∣stance in some few of the most Insuf∣ferances, that all knowing Power, to whom our Cries are directed, knows all the several aggravations of them, and the Consciences of our Masters, cannot but witness to the Truth and Justice of our Complaints.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though we acknowledge man is born to Labour, and had not hands only given him to put Victuals into his Mouth, but first to use them in til∣ling the Earth, and getting Food and all other things requisite for humane Life, yet certainly the merciful God never intended that any of his Crea∣tures should be forced to Labour be∣yond their natural strength, nor have burthens imposed on their weary Shoulders, greater than they are able to bear: Labour was undoubtedly en∣joyned as an exercise to preserve Health and Strength, and prevent Sloth and
<PB N="88" REF="45"/>
Idleness, not as a perpetual Plague to destroy Nature, and make Life a Tor∣ment, and Death a Courtesy; yet our <HI>Flint-hearted Tyrants,</HI> not content with diligent Industry and pains, force us to unreasonable Labours, both for toil and continuance, beyond the pow∣er of Nature; and whereas a good man is merciful even to his Beast, they extend no Compassion to us, who are of the same Species with themselves, but slave us on in continual drudgery, till our Heart-strings crack, and our Nerves are enfeebled, and our Mar∣row is exhausted, and our Bones fall under their Burthens, and our Spirits are consumed, and our Souls in Weari∣ness and Anguish; wish for Death ra∣ther than Life.</P>
<P>The end of all Natures Motions is <HI>Rest,</HI> nor can she perform any of her Operations without Refreshment; <HI>Ground</HI> alwayes plow'd yields little en∣crease, but must lie fallow now and then, if you expect a Crop: A <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> alwayes bent will hardly send an <HI>Ar∣row</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="45"/>
to the <HI>Mark,</HI> but our inconsiderate Masters regard neither the voice of <HI>Nature</HI> nor <HI>Reason,</HI> but with Cruelty compel us to Labour beyond our strength, and allow us no competent time of <HI>Rest</HI> or <HI>Refreshment,</HI> in so much that often-times we are forc'd to work so long at the <HI>Wind-Mills,</HI> until we become so <HI>Weary, Dull, Faint, Heavy</HI> and <HI>Sleepy,</HI> that we are as it were deprived of our natural Senses, or like men in a maze, that we fall into danger, and oft times our Hands and Arms are crusht to pieces, and some∣times most part of our Bodies; and though sometimes these evils do befall us through Carelessness, yet oft times they come by the means aforesaid.</P>
<P>So also we are forced to stand and work at the Coppers, in the hot sul∣pherous Fumes, till Nature being overcome with weariness and want of proper Rest we fall into the fierce boyl∣ing Syrups, and in these disasters little or no pitty is taken of us, for though some indeed profess a superfinal sorrow
<PB N="90" REF="46"/>
for our mischances, it is cheifly for their own sakes, not ours, because thereby they have lost the worth of so much Money as we were reckon'd at, not for the loss of our Lives, which yet to us are as precious, and of as much value as those of our proud and haughty Masters; and so also they are in Thy sight, <HI>O our gracious Creator!</HI> for we likewise are the work of Thine hands, and endued with equal Facul∣ties, both <HI>Sensitive</HI> and <HI>Intellectual.</HI></P>
<P>As in the excess of Labour, so also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the hours of working, our <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> and <HI>European</HI> Masters do commit great Errors, compelling us to work <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll day in the scorching heat, till our Spirits are thereby exhaled, and our Radical Moisture dryed up, which is the fountain of Life; they seldom con∣side<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the nature of hot Climates, wherein no Mortal can endure so many hours severe Labour as in colder Regions. For, 1<HI>st.</HI> The Constitutions of men in hot Climates, are naturally weaker than in cold: 2<HI>dly.</HI> They come
<PB N="91" REF="46"/>
to Maturity in fewer years: 3<HI>dly.</HI> The continual Heat of the scorching Sun opens the Pores, and at those in∣numerable <HI>Sally-ports</HI> powerfully draws out and steals away the sweet Oyl and Radical Balsom of Nature, which causeth a dull faintiness and wearisom Indisposition to attend the whole Body with great <HI>Drought,</HI> which proves very injurious to <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Strength:</HI> 4<HI>thly.</HI> All sorts of Foods are here of a weaker or more unfirm Nature than those of cold; and as they sooner arrive to Maturity, so consequently they sooner perish and corrupt.</P>
<P>For all which reason, it is unreason∣able to expect men should constantly and without due intermission undergo such Labour and Travel in torrid Climates, as in those more temperate and refrigerating. Do not hot Coun∣tries presently set open all the Gates and secret Passages of Nature, even to the very Centre? which weakens and evaporates the pure subtle or vo∣latile Spirits, whence follows exces∣sive
<PB N="92" REF="47"/>
Sweating, Drought &amp; Faintiness; whereas on the contrary, cold Climates shutting up the external Passages, drives the natural heat inward, and makes it more central, which occasions strong natural Heats and Stomachs, able to digest the firmest Foods, and in great Quanties, whence Persons there become strong, hardy and healthy; likewise most sorts of Food in cold Countries is of a firmer, stronger Nature, and generates a more vigorous Nourishment, and firmer Flesh and Fat, and their Fruits will generally keep longer good: Nor did the All-wise <HI>Iehovah</HI> intend or require men to work and labour so strenuous∣ly much and long in hot Climates, having in his natural Providence made no such occasion for it, because there is there no Winter, nor sharp saturnal Airs to cut off and destroy what the Summer brings forth, but Nature here is always pregnant and teeming, and displays her self in all Seasons of the year, with pleasant and fragrant
<PB N="93" REF="47"/>
Fruits, and prepares them to an higher degree, and fitter for present Food, though not so firm and lasting. Be∣sides, People in hot Regions have not need of so many things, there is no occasion for their Houses being so close nor furnisht with so many Circum∣stances of Beds and Bedding, continual Fires, and the like Provisional Accom∣modations to be laid up before-hand, either for Man or Beast; as also half the Clothing will furnish Nature; and the same is to be understood of Foods; for all things necessary to the Main∣tenance of Life are far easier, and with half the Labour procured in hot Coun∣tries. But these things our Masters never lay to heart, but lay burthen upon burthen, till we utterly sink under the weight of their Oppressions; though many of them cannot but be sensible, that they themselves, though they do little or nothing but eat and drink of the choicest Meats &amp; Drinks, and sleep their fill without disturbance,
<PB N="94" REF="48"/>
yet they are here nothing so strong or able to endure Labour and robust Exercises, as they have been and would be in cold Countries; which Refle∣ction, if they had any Bowels of humane Sympathy and Compassion, should encline them to moderate our Servitude, and grant some Allowances of respit and Refreshment unto us, such as might enable us both more cheerful∣ly and effectually to serve them.</P>
<P>It is a custom amongst many of the great Dons of Masters, to allow their Servants little more than only a small piece of Ground to raise their whole Food and Sustenance from; and tho' this be hard, yet that which renders it worse, is, that they will not allow us any sufficient time to manure it, but we must abate it out of that little time which is permitted us to rest in, otherwise, it must be done upon their Sabbath day, whereon we are allowed to rest from our ordinary La∣bours for our Masters; but if then we must work as hard to manure our
<PB N="95" REF="48"/>
small pittance of Ground, or else starve, I do not find what great advantage we have of that day more than another.</P>
<P>It is also an order or custom in some Plantations, where the Christians inhabit, to allow their Negroes two hours Rest at Noon, <HI>viz.</HI> from eleaven of the Clock till one, which is a wise and righteous Law▪ but few there are that will admit us above half that time, but hurry us again to work, which proves very injurious to our Healths; for then the Sun (which is the central heat of the Universe) draws near the Meridean, which does powerfully open the Pores, especially of those that labour hard in the scorching beams thereof, and exhales the Radical Moisture, which weakens and indis∣poses the whole body and mind, and renders us unfit for the After noons work; for he that shall rest from eleaven till wo, which is three hours, shall thereby be rendred so lively, lightsom and brisk, that he shall be able to perform more labour than
<PB N="96" REF="49"/>
another man of the same natural strength, that is kept to it all day long, or allowed but one hours rest only, and with much less prejudice to Nature.</P>
<P>This is a thing worthy to be con∣sidered by our Masters; for it would add much to their <HI>Profit and our Health,</HI> which is also their <HI>Wealth</HI>; for pray tell us, <HI>O you brave and swaggering Christians!</HI> who exercise this strange and severe Mastership over us, who sport your selves in all manner of super∣fluity and wantonness, and grow fat with our Blood and Sweat, gorman∣dizing with the fruits procured by our <HI>Slavery</HI> and sore <HI>Labour</HI>; set by your <HI>Rum-Pots,</HI> your <HI>Punch-Bowls,</HI> your <HI>Brandy-Bottles,</HI> and the rest of your <HI>Intoxicating Enchantments</HI> for a while, and stand still a little, and suffer the cool of the day to overshadow you, and the long obstructed Fountain of Reason in your Hearts to send forth its streams, and then you will be able to tell us what heart or life, strength

Or would you be willing to be thus treated and dealt with, if you were in our condition? No, no, I am certain you would count it hard,

<P>It may be you will say, That <HI>Po∣tato's, Yams,</HI> and the like, are a brave nourishing Food; And indeed so they are, yet give me leave to tell you, that they afford but a weak unfirm fading Nourishment, in comparison of ma∣ny other things that are to be eaten alone, especially to People that have nothing else, and continually work hard: And for you that so cry up the Excellency of these things, which of you all would be contented to live with such Food only for one quarter of a Year, and sometimes to want that too, as you know we often do? I'll warrant you would then think it miserable fare, and be ready to Swear you should be starv'd, and yet you might much better sup∣port

And yet though they make such severe Laws against us, it seems they themselves do not account Stealing in it self any Evil, for besides their daily practice of over-reaching one another in Bar∣gains, which is but a civil way of Stealing, we remember that not ve∣ry long since, six or seven of our Coun∣try-men, who were Slaves to a great
<PB N="102" REF="52"/>
man, were taken stealing of Provisi∣ons from one of his Neighbours; he that took them did not use the rigour of the Law, that is to kill them upon the place, but very Neighbourly brings them to their Master, and com∣plains, who ordered the Overseer to whip them soundly; which being executed accordingly, the Master commanded them to be brought be∣fore him, and there complemented them in this manner; <HI>You Rogues! I beat and whip you not so much for Steal∣ing, as for that you suffered your selves to be caught.</HI> Is not this rare Christian Equity, to beat us unmercifully for that which they themselves do but Laugh at, and make a Jest of? Does this savour of the true Christian Spi∣rit? Nay, certainly, but of the de∣praved Hellish Nature. This more than savage Cruelty and Oppression, proceeds without any Compassion to Age or Sex, for they have no regard to the Weaknesses, Diseases or Infir∣mities of our Women, nor of our
<PB N="103" REF="52"/>
dear and tender Infants, they make our Wives, during the time of their Pregnancy, work equally with the rest, even until the very day of their delivery, or Birth of their Children, which we can scarce call their <HI>Lying-in,</HI> for, alas! they have no moneth∣ly Nurses, nor groaning Cheese, none of the Comforts of Ale, or Wine, or Caudles, or rich refreshing Suppings, but must be content with a few dry <HI>Potatoes,</HI> and a Caudle made with stinking <HI>Mackarel,</HI> or Broths of un∣wholsom putrified Flesh, and glad if they can get it; for in truth they al∣low them little or nothing more than at other times, and but two or three dayes Rest; and then they must out again into the Field with their young and tender Babes, and leave them sprauling on the Ground, which is their only Nurse and Cradle; nor can they expect any Rocking, unless God to punish our Masters Inhuma∣nity, should send an Earthquake; Nay, when they cry for want of the
<PB N="104" REF="53"/>
presence and tendence of their Mo∣thers, and for lack of Sustenance, our rough and churlish Overseers will hardly allow time to give them Suck.</P>
<P>If our Women be disordered by the natural Infirmities attending their Sex, or by the frowardness and cry∣ing of their Children, which have broken their and our short Hours of Sleep; No body comes and asks, <HI>For∣sooth! how have you rested to Night?</HI> Nor cries, <HI>Pray keep no Noise, she has not slept well to Night</HI>; No, no, let the case be how it will, as soon as the Gray-ey'd Morning draws the Cur∣tains of the Day, and the Light be∣gins to peep from behind the Moun∣tains of the East, the blustering Over∣seer blows his Horn, or Sheal, and then presently all Excuses set apart, we and our Wives must turn out with our tender Children, whether we or they be well or sick, disposed or in∣disposed, it matters not, to Work we must go, under the Whip and the Spur, and the Sun's scorching Beams
<PB N="105" REF="53"/>
all the day long, and none comes and desires them to eat a bit and drink before they go out, to prevent the Wind; but on the contrary, if our Wives never so truly plead their In∣ability to labour thus, they find no Ears open to hear them with pity, but severe Hands and lusty Whips rea∣dy to lay on cruel Stripes upon their tender and fainting Backs, and so they are forced to carry their Children with them into the Work-field, and suckle them there, when they can get an opportunity all day, and so lug them home again at Night, and have no refreshing Drinks, nor pro∣per Foods to supply them with dry or moist Nourishment. These things, though our hard hearted Masters regard not, yet methinks, our <HI>Mistrisses,</HI> if not out of Christi∣anity or good Nature, yet out of respect to <HI>Woman-hood,</HI> and their <HI>own Sex,</HI> and by a Compassion raised from their own experience of the dif∣fiulties of Child-bearing, might be
<PB N="106" REF="54"/>
induced to prevail with their Hus∣bands to be more tender in such cases, but so far are even these counted of the softer Sex, from any such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommi∣seration,</HI> that where they alone have the sole command, as when they are left Widdows, or the like, many of them are more fierce, dogged, pinching, oppressing and severe than the men themselves.</P>
<P>But we are not only with unreason∣able Beating, made to labour beyond our strength and abilities of Nature, but many of our Masters will not al∣low us Food that's sufficient, either in quantity or quality, to support and maintain Health, Strength and Vi∣gour; so that being pined with want as well as worn out with excessive Drudgery, we oft times perish, or at least become poor, lean, feeble, and hardly able to go. For as when they do allow us Ground to plant for our Nourishment, the same is so little, as not to be half sufficient for that pur∣pose, and so much the worse, because
<PB N="107" REF="54"/>
they afford us no time to Till and Im∣prove it; So when they pretend to buy us any Food, more than our Plantation-Provisions, <HI>viz.</HI> either Fish or Flesh, they will go to all the Merchants in the Town, and dili∣gently inquire out, and buy the worst they can lay their Hands on, <HI>viz.</HI> stinking decayed Flesh and rotten Fish, and cry, <HI>It is good enough for</HI> Negro's, <HI>they care not how bad it is, so they can buy it cheap</HI>; Some of them indeed are so free that they will allow us one salt <HI>Mackarel</HI> or two a Week, but others will afford us none, which lays us under a necessity either to Starve or Steal; for we are reduced to such Extremity, that if a Horse dye, and is buried several dayes, if some of our People come to know it, they will dig up the putrified stink∣ing Carrion, and make good Chear of it; others will eat all the Cats, Dogs, Rats and Mice they can lay their Hands on; So that through Ne∣cessity, and the depravedness of our
<PB N="108" REF="55"/>
Minds, with evil Customs, we are immers'd into all the Beastiality and Uncleanness, which the <HI>Christians</HI> have never endeavoured to regulate, or prevent, but rather the contrary.</P>
<P>By these, and variety of other the like Miseries and Oppressions, many of us have been brought to dispair, and chuse a miserable sinful Death, rather than such a wretched Life, whence some have Hang'd, others Drown'd themselves, some cut their own Throats, and procured to them∣selves the like violent Deaths; but our Blood is of no value in the sight of our Masters, which yet we doubt not but will cry unto thee. O thou most just Creator and Governour of men! for Revenge upon those that have been the prime occasions of all these Evils.</P>
<P>For these hard Usages and Cruel∣ties do terribly awaken the central Wrath and sleeping Poysons of the Original Nature, by which means and provocations we become sullen,
<PB N="109" REF="55"/>
dogged, malicious, envious, angry and revengeful, all which devilish Dispositions are occasioned, or much increased in us by the harsh Tyranny of our Masters; Hence many times we neglect our Labour, run away, spoil our Business, &amp; in the anguish of our <HI>souls</HI> continually curse our Masters and their Posterity; And thence on the other side, our Masters take occasion to redouble their Cruel Usages to∣wards us, and be-labour themselves to Beat and Whip us, and hang us up by the Hands, Feet, and the like, and so <HI>Bastinado</HI> us till our Bodies become like a piece of raw Flesh, and we are just ready to give up the Ghost: For though we are, <HI>O Great Creator</HI>! the Work of thy Hands, and were made in thine Image, and endued with rational and immortal Souls, yet we are nothing more in many of our Masters esteem, than <HI>their Money,</HI> and if some of them could find out a way to torment and plague us ten fold more, they would do it, provided
<PB N="110" REF="56"/>
we might still be but able to perform our Drudgery, to maintain them in Superfluity and Gluttony.</P>
<P>For our precious Lives are reckon∣ed no more than those of so many Dogs, though they cannot gratifie their Pallates and Paunches, nor maintain themselves in their Luxu∣ries, and sinful Vanities, but meerly by our Labours, yet on any irregular Passion or devilish Humor, some of them will sacrifice our Lives to their Fury, and neither count it Murther, nor any Sin, neither did we ever hear that their Law in such Cases made Inquisition for Blood, or punished those that committed such Murders, otherwise than by a Fine, or ordering them to pay so much Sugar for the business; as if there were any Equa∣lity, Proportion or Adequateness be∣tween such a <HI>Crying Crime,</HI> and such a <HI>triffling</HI> Punishment. Do not your Plantations which have drank up our innocent and unrevenged Blood, cry unto the Lord, the righteous Judge

of Heaven and Earth, for Justice and Retaliation? For divers of our <HI>Coun∣try-men</HI> have been Butcher'd this way, and little more notice taken of it than if we were Fleas or Gnats, or Wolves or Bears.</P>
<P>Nay, some of us have been Burnt for running away (and yet we were therein justified by the Law of Na∣ture, for who would not escape, if he could, out of Slavery?) and this too, although their Mistrisses and Masters might have sold them, to be trans∣ported elsewhere; but their Envy, Passion and Revenge was so great, that they prefer'd it before their Gain; one Widdow Woman above all the rest, (as we have heard) burned her <HI>Negro</HI> for running away, and saying, that, <HI>Where-ever he met her, he would Kill her</HI>: So when she caught him, she was Judge, Jury, Executioner, and all, though at the same time she might have sold him to be Transpor∣ted to <HI>Mevis.</HI></P>

Or did thy eternal Son, the Saviour of the World, preach any such Doctrine, or set any such Example in his meek and holy Pilgrimage on Earth?

But how does this consist or agree with the <HI>Violence, Injustice</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> which you exercise upon us? Or is your Religi∣on one thing in profession, and ano∣ther in practise? This we are sure of, though, your <HI>Tongues</HI> may be <HI>Chri∣stian,</HI> your <HI>Hands</HI> are <HI>Heathen</HI>; nay, most times your <HI>very Language</HI> is con∣trary to your before-mentioned Pre∣tensions, for how else comes it to pass that you <HI>Rant,</HI> and <HI>Rave,</HI> and <HI>Swear,</HI> and <HI>Curse,</HI> and call devilish <HI>Names</HI> so fast upon the least thing, wherein we displease your Humors.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="58"/>But perhaps you will say, That not by virtue of your Religion, but by some super-excellent or higher Dignity of Nature above us, you claim a Right to make us your Slaves and Vassals. But pray, have you this Prerogative from your Descent or Pedigree? Or from some different Fabrick of your Bodies? Or from your extraordinary <HI>Endowments</HI> of Mind? As for the first, do not the Oracles of your Religion oblige you to believe, that the great God created the Man whom you call <HI>Adam,</HI> and that from him came all the People that ever since were, or are in the World? And if so, are we not of as good Parentage, as ancient a Family, as noble a Descent as the best of you? Ought you not then to love us as your Brethren, de∣scended from the same common Fa∣ther? or at least respect us as your Kinsmen, and of the same Lineage.</P>
<P>Are not our <HI>Bodies</HI> of as proporti∣onable a Frame, and as well furnisht with useful <HI>Limbs</HI>? Are not all our
<PB N="115" REF="59"/>
<HI>Senses</HI> as good and quick as yours? Nay, are we not naturally obnoxi∣ous to fewer Diseases than you, though now indeed by your harsh usage our Days are often shortned, and our Health impaired; but this is not the fault of our Constitutions, but of your Severities, which bring upon us those Weaknesses and Disorders, which we were never before acquainted with▪ For any Exercises of Running, Leaping, Swimming, and the like, which of you can equal us? As for the <HI>blackness</HI> of our Skins, we find no reason to be ashamed of it, 'tis the <HI>Livery</HI> which our great Lord and Maker hath thought fit we should wear; Do not you amongst Furs, prize pure <HI>Sables</HI> as much as <HI>Ermins</HI>? Is <HI>Iett</HI> or <HI>Ebony</HI> despised for its Co∣lour? Can we help it, if the Sun by too close and fervent Kisses, and the nature of the Climate and Soil where we were Born, hath tinctur'd us with a dark Complexion? Have not you variety of Complexions amongst
<PB N="116" REF="59"/>
your selves; some very <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Fair,</HI> others <HI>Brown,</HI> many <HI>Swarthy,</HI> and several <HI>Cole-black</HI>? And would it be reasonable that each sort of these should quarrel with the other, and a man be made <HI>a Slave</HI> forever, meerly because his Beard is <HI>Red,</HI> or his Eye∣brows <HI>Black?</HI> In a word, if our <HI>Hue</HI> be the only difference, since <HI>White</HI> is as contrary to <HI>Black,</HI> as <HI>Black</HI> is to <HI>White,</HI> there is as much reason that <HI>you</HI> should be our <HI>Slaves,</HI> as we yours.</P>
<P>Lastly, as to our <HI>Souls,</HI> you dare not deny but they are <HI>Immortal</HI> as well as yours, consequently capable of as much Bliss and Happiness, be∣ing as well as yours, created in the Image of God, and of an hea∣venly Original: Have we not the same Faculties, Understanding, Me∣mory and Will? Are we not endued with a reflex Power, whereby to con∣demn or approve our own Actions as they are either good or evil? Are we not, if we had the advantages of Education, altogether as docible, and
<PB N="117" REF="60"/>
apt to learn Arts and Sciences as any of you? witness <HI>Averves, Avicenna,</HI> and others of our Country-men▪ who were famous <HI>Physitians, Philosophers, Astrologians,</HI> and the like. For in us as well as you, are contained the true Natures of all Elements, the Seeds of all Sciences, and an hidden Epitom of the four Worlds, <HI>Intellectual, Rational, Elemental</HI> and <HI>Sensitive.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, we are not so ready at Words, nor so nimble to express our Conceptions, but we can more than guess at what is Just, and Fit, and Ho∣nest, and Seemly, and know what is a∣greeable to the dignity of humane Na∣ture, and what not, though the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> despise us by the Name of <HI>Hea∣thens</HI>; we must acknowledge that we are not so well acquainted with the wordy and notional matters of Reli∣gion, nor do talk so much of it, nor keep so much ado about it, as many of the <HI>Christians</HI> do, for we do not Wrangle, nor Fight, nor Backbite or Hate one another for, or touching
<PB N="181" REF="60"/>
the Worship of God: Nor do we Kill, Burn or Imprison any for not agreeing with us, or being of our Intellectual Complexions, because God in his Wisdom has made all things to differ; many there are whose Eyes are open see into the truth of these things.</P>
<P>As for our Faith, touching God and Eternity, we have not much to say, neither do we ever use many Words; For we have only one Book, <HI>viz. Our selves,</HI> in which is contained the true Nature and Property of all things, both Internally and External∣ly, and happy is he that can read but the <HI>Christ-Cross-Row</HI> in his own Book, it is more profitable to him than a multitude of Books, cry'd up and admired by the World: And this we do know and acknowledge, that there is a good and an evil Spirit or Principle within us, one which prompts, and invites, and leads us to Good, and the other drawing us to Evil; and by the light of the good
<PB N="119" REF="61"/>
Principle, we distinguish between what is Right, and the contrary; and whensoever we do Evil, we are con∣vinced and reproved for it by this good Genius, whereby we are sen∣sible that Lying, Swearing, Adul∣tery, Idleness, Disobedience to our Masters, Burning of Houses, Mur∣ther, and the like, are Sins against God; and when at any time we com∣mit any such things, we are accused and condemned for the same in our Hearts, though our Masters, nor any Creature else know thereof.</P>
<P>In short, the main Differences be∣tween the <HI>Christians</HI> and us, seem to be no more than these, that they are <HI>White,</HI> and we <HI>Black,</HI> because they are born in one Climate, and we in another; they have <HI>Learning,</HI> as Reading, Writing, speaking of va∣rious Languages, and we have none of those Ornamental Advantages; but they may please to remember that the more Paint Glass has upon it, the more it keeps out the Light; They
<PB N="120" REF="61"/>
are educated under certain <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Forms,</HI> and taught divers <HI>Notions of Religion,</HI> which we are not skill'd in: But the grand point of Religion, <HI>To do as we would be done by,</HI> we under∣stand as well as they, and are sure they practise it less than we. What then do they talk so much of <HI>the Leaves,</HI> when we can see <HI>no Fruits</HI>? let us <HI>feel</HI> their <HI>Christianity,</HI> and <HI>see</HI> it, as well as <HI>hear of it,</HI> and no doubt then we shall be more in love with it.</P>
<P>These, I say, are the chief Diffe∣rences; for as to the natural <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roper∣ties of the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> there is but very little, setting aside Custom and Education. For as I said before, as to the Members of the Body, and in∣ward Faculties, we are alike in all particulars; neither is there any dif∣ference as to the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> they are as much subject to Passions, Lusts, and irregular Affections as we, as al∣so to Sicknesses, Mortality, and all other Misfortunes; And as your Pro∣phet hath said, <HI>God</HI> (whose wonder∣ful
<PB N="121" REF="62"/>
Works we both equally are) <HI>is no Respecter of Persons, but every one t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at feareth his Name, and worketh Righte∣ousness,</HI> (according to the Measure and Gift he has endued every one with) <HI>whether Bond or Free,</HI> Jew <HI>or</HI> Gentile, <HI>is accepted of him.</HI> And it is not the <HI>Name</HI> that will justifie, but a living in the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>well-doing,</HI> according as the Creator has dispensed his Gifts to each Person: And let <HI>Christians</HI> know this as a cer∣tain truth, that neither before, nor at the great Day of Reckoning, and when Accounts must be given, good Words, nor long formal Prayers will stand them in stead, except they have lived in the Nature, Power and Ope∣ration of the good Spirit, which we pray, and wish they would do; and that they would <HI>Act</HI> what they <HI>Talk,</HI> and then both they and we should find the Benefit, to the Praise and Glory of God, and our own Com∣fort: For this is without dispute, that since <HI>Christians</HI> do know more of God
<PB N="122" REF="62"/>
and of the heavenly Mysteries than we do, then there is the more requi∣red of them; and how they dis∣charge themselves in their Practice we cannot see; for surely they do very little or not at all live in, and under the <HI>Christian</HI> Spirit; for that leads all that are guided by it, to love even their Enemies, to take Com∣passion, and do unto all as they would be done unto, and also endues it Fol∣lowers with the Virtues of <HI>Meekness, Humility, Self-denyal, Temperance</HI> and <HI>Purity,</HI> and to deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts.</P>
<P>But instead of these dictates of thy most holy Religion, O thou great Preserver of men! they enslave and oppress thy poor unworthy Servants, and are drunk with our Blood and Sweat; We rise early, and lie down late, and labour beyond our strength, whilst our luxurious Masters stretch themselves on their soft Beds and Couches, they drink Wine in over∣flowing Bowls, and set their Brains
<PB N="123" REF="63"/>
a-float without either <HI>Rudder</HI> or <HI>Com∣pass,</HI> in an Ocean of other strong and various Drinks, even till they are Drunk, and vomit up their Shame and Filthiness, whilst we are allow'd no∣thing but Water, and now and then a little <HI>Cowou:</HI> They feast themselves with the fattest Lambs, and variety of rich costly Foods, and live in all Uncleanness and Gluttony: They have their Men-Servants, and their Maids, their Coaches and Horses to wait on them, whilst we groan under the over-grievous Burthens, and ex∣cessive Labour which they impose upon us: They wantonly consume the Encrease and Product of our heavy Pains in Riot and Voluptousness, in Superfluity, and all kind of extrava∣gant Vitiousness; their chief <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Philosophy</HI> being to gratifie their liqourish Palates, and insatiate Paun∣ches, and to enslave us with many intollerable Burthens; so that their Lamps are ready to be extinguished by their Superfluity and Excess of Oyl,
<PB N="124" REF="63"/>
whilst they make frequent and solemn <HI>Feasts,</HI> (that is, offer Sacrifices, and celebrate Festivals to their Idol <HI>Belly-God-Paunch,</HI> the Divinity which they chiefly adore) and invite our rich Masters and Dames, and there they sit Eating and Drinking, (whether they have any Appetites or no) in a formal way, perhaps two or three Hours, inticing each other to Gor∣mandize and Guzzle down great Quantities, and variety of rich Food and strong Cordial-Drinks, not only beyond the Necessities, but even the power of Nature; and yet not there∣with content, when they have thus already exceeded all bounds of Tem∣perance, they yet proceed to gorge themselves with Wine, various sorts of brave noble Fruits, Tarts, Sweet-Meats, and a thousand Novelties brought from forreign Regions of themselves, more than sufficient for a sober and temperate Meal, not con∣sidering the Injuries they thereby do both to their Bodies and Minds, nor
<PB N="125" REF="64"/>
regarding in the mean time, the star∣ving condition of us their poor Slaves, that would be glad of the Crums that fall from their over-spread Tables; and yet 'tis from our sore Labour, and grievous Sweat, and pinched Bellies, that what they thus wickedly waste upon their pampered Lusts, is extracted.</P>
<P>Alas! how few of our <HI>Christian</HI> Masters, do ever consider or endea∣vour to put into practice either <HI>Ab∣stinence</HI> or <HI>Sobriety,</HI> though their own Prophets and Apostles commend those Virtues as the surest Bulwarks and Fortifications against Temptations and Viciousness, and such as render the Body pleasant and healthful, fit to discharge all its Functions, and pre∣pares the Mind to be the Temple of the Lord. But these are things too sublim for our gorbellied <HI>Christians</HI> to consider of, when a number of them gather themselves together to the Burial of a Swine, which they will Roast (or burn) it whole, and then
<PB N="126" REF="64"/>
bury it in their ungodly Paunches, and make them swim in their foolish Hogshead, accompanied with <HI>drunken Healths,</HI> and <HI>roaring Huzza's,</HI> where one or two of these <HI>Epicurean</HI> swear∣ing roaring <HI>Christians</HI> will destroy in Superfluity as much as an hundred of us poor Vassals can get with our hand and sore Labour.</P>
<P>But why, O ye <HI>Christians</HI>! do you thus violate the Commands of our Creator, and withstand, and walk contrary to the pure innocent Laws of Nature, and by your <HI>Intemperances</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> contemn the great Law of Love, and doing unto all their fellow Creatures as they would be done unto: Consider these things impartially, and count us no longer <HI>Dogs,</HI> nor hide the Pearl any longer in your ungodly Earth, and be as stu∣dious and careful to look for it, and find it, as you have carelesly lost it, and you shall see and know the Errors of your wayes; and above all, know this, that every Master must give an
<PB N="127" REF="65"/>
Account of his Stewardship to the grand Master of Heaven and Earth, and that there must be Retaliation made, either in this World, or the World to come.</P>
<P>But alas! what likelihood or hopes are there of our Relief, Ease, or Re∣freshment from those <HI>Oppressions</HI> and <HI>Burthens</HI> under which we languish, when these we complain of are be∣come so unnatural, that they deal as hardly and cruelly with their own Seed, even the Fruit of their own Loins, as with us? For do not our Masters, to gratifie their raging Lusts, sometimes take our Women, and make them their Concubines, <HI>viz.</HI> either our Wives, or our Daughters, which best pleaseth them, (For <HI>Adultery</HI> is accounted no greater a Crime amongst many of them than <HI>Fornication,</HI> &amp; both of them but <HI>Venial Sins, Tricks of Youth,</HI> or <HI>Modish Gal∣lantries</HI>) upon whom they beget mungril Children, that are neither White nor Black, but between both,
<PB N="129" REF="65"/>
which therefore are called <HI>Molatto's,</HI> and when these poor Women in compliance with such their brutish Heats, have conceived by them, and brought forth, yet the Fathers, being without natural Affection, though they are their own Seed, do expose them, and make them perpetual Slaves, both they and their Posterity. Now what can be more hellish Cru∣elty, or greater Baseness, then for men to afflict their own Seed, to be∣get Children in their Drunkenness and Paroxisms of Lust, and then not to care what becomes of them; nay, to make themselves Authors of their Miseries as well as of their Beeing, and instead of providing for, and well Educating them, to enslave and ty∣rannize over them, and leave them in that wretched condition to all Ge∣nerations: There cannot sure be a greater Sin against Gods pure Law in Nature; Do not the whole Hosts of the four Worlds condemn this? and will not the very Beasts of the
<PB N="130" REF="66"/>
Earth rise in Judgment against such vile hard hearted Wretches, and Nature disown and spue them out as abominable?</P>
<P>For as the Cruelties and Oppres∣sions of our Masters are <HI>our Plagues</HI> at present, so they will certainly draw down Judgments on <HI>themselves</HI> in time, if not prevented by Repen∣tance and Reformation; for their Violence awakens the center of dark Wrath, both in the internal and ex∣ternal Nature, and by a secret and sympathetical Power these awakened poysonous Properties do strongly ex∣cite the malignant Influences of the <HI>Coelestials,</HI> and attract their <HI>Male Con∣figurations</HI>; for every particular Qua∣lity in <HI>Nature</HI> has a Key in it self to open the Gate of its own Principle, whence proceed many Calamities, ac∣cording to the degree of the Sin or Evil committed, there being a certain Secret (by powerful sympathy) be∣tween the <HI>Coelestial</HI> and <HI>Terrestrial</HI> Bodies, by and through whose evil Influences mutually work∣ing
<PB N="131" REF="66"/>
on each other, <HI>Plagues</HI> and <HI>Ven∣geance,</HI> and <HI>Calamities</HI> are engendred; as on the other side, by their benigne Influences sweetly clasping and em∣bracing each other in <HI>Harmony, Peace</HI> and <HI>Plenty, Health</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> do proceed.</P>
<P>For this cause it is in point of <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> a thing of dangerous Conse∣quence for our <HI>Christian</HI> Masters to be so severe towards us; for the groaning of him that suffereth Pain and Torment, is the beginning of Trouble and Misery to him that is the cause thereof. And it would be well for them, and happy for us poor Vassals, if our Masters would but be so sober as to consider, and be sensible of this Truth, that their fierce <HI>Wrath, Violence,</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> to us, do clearly demonstrate that the <HI>poysonous Wrath</HI> is awakened, &amp; does predomi∣nate in them, so that let them call them∣selves by what <HI>name</HI> or <HI>title</HI> they please, <HI>His Servants they are whom they obey</HI>; the <HI>dark fierce Spirit</HI> has overcome the
<PB N="132" REF="67"/>
good Genius in their Soul, and all the pure Virtues, as <HI>Temperance, Com∣passion, Fellow-feeling, Courtesie, Hu∣manity, Iustice,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> are clapt under Hatches, just as we were when we were brought Captive out of <HI>Guinnea,</HI> into the Land of Bondage. And then this irritated Wrath, or poysonous Spirit, does powerfully penetrate all <HI>Elements</HI> and <HI>Bodies,</HI> and where-ever it finds matter capable or disposed to receive its malignant Rayes they incorporate: For the <HI>All, wise Creator</HI> has endued every thing in all the four Worlds with an attractive and influential Virtue; and therefore the Sons of men by their <HI>Vncleanness, Violence</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> do first awaken and stir up the wrath∣ful Spirit in themselves, which kindles the Wrath in the <HI>Coelestial Bodies,</HI> and attracts their ill Influences; and if whole Nations or Countries live in the irritated Wrath, then there are showered down Epidemical Diseases, as <HI>Pestilence, War, Famine,</HI> and the like,
<PB N="133" REF="67"/>
all according to the nature of the Evils committed, or Properties of Na∣ture that were awakned.</P>
<P>The same is to be understood when any particular Person or Family has awakned the <HI>poysonous Wrath,</HI> it doth powerfully attract the male Influ∣ences, whence Sickness, waste of Estate, and many other great Troubles &amp; Miseries, both to the Body and Mind follow; the truth of this daily Experience doth testifie; how many of our great Masters have by their <HI>Vitiousness, Vncleanness, Intem∣perance, Violence</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> both to Man and Beast, whom they have had the Government over, fallen into great Disorders, Distempers, Losses, Crosses, Troubles and Vexations, so that their Children that were kept so fine and choice, that they would hardly suffer the Air to blow on them or their Legs to carry them whilst they lived in Prosperity, are many of them come to nothing? some forced to work hard for their Bread, others
<PB N="134" REF="68"/>
have taken worse Courses, and have been immaturely cut off.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Evils both private and publick are sometimes more tol∣lerable, also the good Life and Pray∣ers of some sober People that live in a Town or Country, do interpose, and in some degree withstand or mittigate the poysonous kindled Wrath, so that the Judgment is sometimes deferred, and with-holden, as for two or three Ages, according to the degrees of the awakned Evils, and the intermingled Virtues.</P>
<P>Therefore since we have obtained the favour to plead our own Cause, we will be bold to tell our Masters, that these things cannot be otherwise, it being the eternal Law of God in Nature, that whatever <HI>Evil, Violence</HI> or <HI>Oppression</HI> is committed, either by Superior or Inferior, if not repented of, there must be a time of Retalia∣tion either in this World, or that to come, according to the Nature of the
<PB N="135" REF="68"/>
Evil; for as there is such an Affinity between man and man, that they can move each other either to Love or Hate, so there is a proportionate Si∣militude between him and the <HI>Coele∣stial Bodies</HI> and <HI>Elements,</HI> Man being not only the Image and Likeness of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> but the <HI>Horizon</HI> of both Worlds, in whom the superior and inferior Natures are conjoyned, and have their Intercourse; for he is the Off-spring of the Stars, as well as the Sun of the Earth.</P>
<P>Therefore let us praise and magnifie the Lord, Creator of this wonderful Nature, which is surpassing humane Understanding and Number; For there is no Religion or form of Wor∣ship in the World so noble and well-pleasing to him, as for mankind to imitate him by living in, and under the power of the eternal Principle of his <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> which will lead all that hearken to the Voice of <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> into all Innocency and Well-doing, and thereby as naturally at∣tract
<PB N="136" REF="69"/>
or draw down the sweet and pleasant Virtues out of all things, as the <HI>Loadstone</HI> doth Iron.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, our Masters have built their <HI>Babel,</HI> and fortified themselve; with the Poysons of <HI>Sa∣turn,</HI> and Fierceness of <HI>Mars,</HI> and made <HI>Gluttony</HI> their <HI>Trade,</HI> and <HI>Vio∣lence</HI> their <HI>Study,</HI> whence proceed all our Miseries and Oppressions, which at long-run recoyl back upon them∣selves with Interest, destroying all their peace of Mind, health of Body, and outward Estates. For are not most of those that thus violate our <HI>Creator's</HI> Law in Nature, miserably afflicted with many cruel Diseases, as the <HI>Stone, Collick, windy Distem∣pers, Palsies, Cramp, Leprosies, Kings-Evils, Gout, dry Belly-Aches, Dropsies, Consumptions,</HI> and an hundred other Evils of this Nature, which they also intail on their Prosterity; so also are they plauged with Vexations and Discords between Man and Wife, and with disobedient and rebellious
<PB N="137" REF="69"/>
Children; <HI>Rot</HI> and <HI>Murrain</HI> amongst their Cattel, their Crops blasted or spoiled by unseasonable Weather, Losses and Disappointments in their Trading, even to the consumption of their Estates; All which are the <HI>Iudgments of God,</HI> and just Rewards that follow <HI>Oppression▪ Violence</HI> and <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and of spending the Blood and Sweat of their poor <HI>Slaves</HI> in su∣perfluous Wantonness; for they make nothing to squander away Talents in Courtly Vanities, and value not Money in the way of <HI>Gluttony,</HI> then it shall go by whole Sale: But if a poor Slave breaks but <HI>a Glass</HI>▪ or mis∣carries in any little inconsiderable thing, then presently the <HI>livid Poyson of Saturn</HI> is raised, and the flaming <HI>Thunder-bolts of Mars</HI> are let fly in the greatest Fury and Fierceness imagi∣nable, and the best word that comes out of their Mouth, is, <HI>Dog, Devil, damn'd Dog, Bitch,</HI> and the like hel∣lish Expressions, not to mention their horrid <HI>Oathes, Curses</HI> and <HI>Execrations,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="70"/>
which lewd Words are followed by <HI>inhumane Blows</HI>; for they fall upon us with <HI>Whip and Spur</HI> till the Blood come, and we are almost killed with their Cruelty.</P>
<P>And though they boast, and speak excellent things of the <HI>Christian-Religion,</HI> and contemn us for being ignorant of it; yet 'tis plain they ne∣ver design that we should know and embrace it; for why else do they make it loathsom in our Eyes, by acting so contrary to its <HI>Genuine</HI> Nature and Principles? Why do they dress up that which is the <HI>greatest Beauty,</HI> and the most <HI>amiable</HI> thing in the World, in the shape of a fright∣ful deformed <HI>Hag,</HI> or terrible <HI>Fury,</HI> that seems good for nothing but to <HI>Bite</HI> and <HI>Scratch,</HI> and <HI>Prog for its Paunch,</HI> and wallow in Uncleanness like a Swine? Were they in earnest, or desirous to make us <HI>Christians,</HI> and save our <HI>immortal Souls,</HI> they would remove out of our way all <HI>Stumbling-Blocks</HI> of Scandal, &amp; draw us with the
<PB N="139" REF="70"/>
Cords of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Meekness</HI>; they would set us Examples by their blame∣less Lives, and holy Conversations, they would be at pains and charge to teach us the Foundation Principles of <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and to read the <HI>Bible,</HI> and would in those, and other Exercises of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> bring up our little <HI>Ones</HI>: But so far are they from any of this, that they act the direct contrary, and desire and en∣deavour to keep us <HI>Heathens,</HI> that we may continue their <HI>Slaves,</HI> and there∣by are Guilty not only of oppressing our Bodies, but (as much as in them lies) of <HI>damning our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>But our God is more merciful, and expects a Return but proportionable to the Talent he hath intrusted; his Ways are the Paths of Love, and all his Out-goings are Compassion; he hath not left us without a guide, even a Light shining in a dark place, to the conduct whereof, if we give heed, we shall do well.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="71"/>Nor do we in this Complaint in∣tend to tax all our <HI>Christian</HI> Masters, for we must acknowledge that there are some few of them more Just and Merciful unto us; for though under them we labour hard, yet we have our Food in some order, both as to Quantity and Quality, and have to∣lerable Rest, which gives us Life and Vigour in our occasions; neither do they lay upon us Burthens greater than we can bear; besides, they of∣ten speak kindly to us, which chears and comforts our Hearts and Spirits; they call us no evil Names, which is well liking unto us; They allow us the usual time each day to rest in, and eat our Food; They treat our Wo∣men more kindly, and allow them better Accomodations, when they bring forth their young Ones: And though sometimes some of this better sort, will command our young Wo∣men to be their <HI>Concubines,</HI> yet then in such cases, if they prove with-Child, they will have some regard to their

own Seed, and respect to the Women: And it is also observable, that all such as deal any thing gently, and with Moderation and Compassion towards us, are generally blessed with the Dew of Heaven, and with consi∣derable Profits, and their Men and Women Servants, and Cattel, do stand to Health, and thrive; for by well-doing, though it be but as it were by halfs, they attract some of the sweet Influences, both of the su∣perior and inferior Worlds, and go not without a Reward; which might teach all our Masters to imitate that course, and use Pity, Good-will and Equity in their dealings with us, whereby they would not only pre∣serve a good Conscience void of Of∣fence, which is the greatest and most durable Riches on this side the Grave, but also might increase their outward Wealth, by saving them in their Pur∣ses one, two, three or four Hundred Pounds <HI>per</HI> Year, in the buying of Slaves.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="72"/>For the Tyranny, ill Usage and Improvidence of the generality may further appear by the great Numbers of our Country-men and Women that are brought every Year to <HI>America,</HI> and the Isles thereabouts, which shews the vast Consumption or De∣struction that is made of us in those parts; we shall only give one Ex∣ample; in the small Island of <HI>Bar∣badoes</HI> there are supposed to be com∣monly resident, <HI>forty</HI> or <HI>fifty</HI> Thou∣sand of our Country-People, that are <HI>Slaves</HI>; and though we have our Custom of <HI>Plurality of Wives,</HI> and are naturally as fruitful as most Nati∣ons, yet <HI>our Off-spring</HI> will not main∣tain the Number, but they are forced yearly to bring in by Shipping, seve∣ral <HI>Thousands</HI> more of our Country∣men, as <HI>fresh Supplies,</HI> and to maintain the <HI>old Stock</HI> or Number; so that it looks like the <HI>Fields of Mars,</HI> where often <HI>Recruits</HI> are required to supply the place of the <HI>slaughtered Soldiers.</HI> Now would not any rational man

conclude, that if <HI>One Thousand</HI> Men and <HI>One Thousand</HI> Women, (most of them young, and capable of Gene∣ration) lived in a seperated place or Isle, where they want for no Conve∣niencies, for a matter of ten or twen∣ty Years, who, (I say) could but in reason expect these two Thousand to be multiplyed at least to four Thou∣sand, or more, and that they would encrease so fast as to grow rather Su∣perfluous and Super-numerary, than that there should be any occasion to purchase more at dear Rates, from remote Regions: For thus it usually happens in other parts of the World, as <HI>England,</HI> (which is the Country of many of our <HI>Christian</HI> Masters) does not it spare every Year great Num∣bers of Men, which of late Years have settled several <HI>Colonies,</HI> and peo∣pled divers Countries and Islands in <HI>America,</HI> which are like to become very numerous, and yet still their own Country rather over-stockt, than wanting of men to carry on their

Affairs; besides, there come thence great Numbers of Young men, as <HI>Factors, Sea-men, Soldiers,</HI> and others that daily are transported by Troops, many of whom never return again: And how many Thousands of Wo∣men might <HI>England</HI> spare yearly? of whom many that are fit and ca∣pable of Generation, are never mar∣ried; and others, through want of good Husbands in time, or to please their Parents humours, or for base Lucre, marry Old, and have no Issue, and yet still <HI>England</HI> wants no People, but (as we have heard) is able to spare two or three Hundred Thou∣sand on a good occasion; And why might not we in <HI>America</HI> encrease and multiply proportionably, were it not for those violent Oppressions, and harsh Usages, which our Masters afflict us with, whereby we are de∣stroyed before our time? And is it not a strange, &amp; an unheard of thing, that a fourth or fifth part every Year should dye, and be made away with,

more than there are born? Or can there be a more undeniable Evidence of the <HI>Cruelty</HI> exercised upon us, oc∣casioning this extraordinary <HI>Morta∣lity,</HI> and the <HI>immature Deaths</HI> of such great Numbers of us yearly?

<P>Hold your Tongue, there go many other things to make a <HI>Christian</HI> besides that; for he must also know and believe, that Man be∣ing thus made, did by transgressing the <HI>Law</HI> of his Maker, <HI>fall</HI> from that good and perfect State, wherein he was made, into a sinful estate, and thereby was liable to the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> and so to be <HI>Damn'd</HI> forever, or suffer everlasting Punishment.

4<HI>thly</HI>; To avoid <HI>evil Communication,</HI> because it corrupts good Manners, and vain Words, but especially wick∣ed Ones. 5<HI>thly</HI>; To observe the <HI>Rules of Purity,</HI> and abstain from all <HI>appear∣ance</HI> of <HI>Evil,</HI> both in Words and Works. 6<HI>thly;</HI> To free our selves from <HI>Envy, Strife, Malice, Back-biting</HI> and <HI>Slander</HI>; not to accuse men behind their Backs of what they will not speak to their Faces, or cannot prove. 7<HI>thly</HI>; Not to judge of things we <HI>un∣derstand not,</HI> lest we be judged; nor con∣demn those things of which we have no certain Knowledge or Experience. 8<HI>thly</HI>; To be sensible that the Lord by his <HI>all-seeing-Eye</HI> and <HI>divine Prin∣ciple,</HI> beholds all our Wayes, and that to him there is nothing hidden. 9<HI>thly</HI>; To believe and know for a certain truth, that the Lord will Re∣taliate and Reward every one accord∣ing to his Works. 10. To live ac∣cording to the Gospel and divine Principle, by denying <HI>all Vngodliness</HI> and <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> and <HI>Vncleanness,</HI> as
<PB N="157" REF="79"/>
<HI>Whoredom, Adultery, filthy Speaking</HI>; yea, even all <HI>unchaste Desires,</HI> for so our Lord teacheth us, <HI>That he that looketh on a Woman, and lusteth after her, commits Adultery.</HI> 11.

That we be not too confident, nor conceited of our selves, or our own knowledge, but to have regard to the Lord in all our Thoughts, Imaginations and Conclusions, and in every thing to have an Eye to his Pro∣vidence. 13. To return God the <HI>Praise and Glory</HI> of all the good things we enjoy, as <HI>Health, Strength,

Food, Rayment, Knowledge, Vnder∣standing,</HI> and the like, acknowledg∣ing them all to be the free Gifts of his Bounty; and when we are in any want, trouble, distress or danger to <HI>relie</HI> upon the same God for help, suc∣cour and relief, and with earnest, hearty and faithful <HI>Prayers,</HI> to im∣plore the same of him only. 14.

be in good earnest, and tell me the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do assure thee, they are the Principles of our Lord, Christ, the Son of the living God, that he preach∣ed to the World when he was on the Earth, and which his Apostles recom∣mended, and left them on Record in the <HI>Bible</HI>; and which he still conti∣nues to Preach by his Spirit in the Hearts of all that are his.</P>

<P>Since these things are so, I cannot but at once be <HI>surprized,</HI> and as it were <HI>amazed,</HI> with two diffe∣rent Objects of Wonder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they, prethee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negr.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, I admire the <HI>Ex∣cellency of your Doctrine,</HI> and the <HI>wonderful Mystery</HI> contained there∣in; it undoubtedly surpasseth all other Religions in the World, as much as the Sun's Light doth that of a <HI>Glow-Worm</HI>: It seems to me to be an <HI>open Gate</HI> into <HI>Paradise,</HI> and a <HI>Leaf</HI> of the <HI>Tree of Life</HI>; so agreeable to the Nature and Glory of the <HI>great God,</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="81"/>
so suitable to the condition of <HI>weak Man</HI>; no wise Person can make any scruple of the things you have deli∣vered, they command assent; for they proced from a <HI>true Root.</HI></P>
<P>But then I cannot but also much wonder and admire that you <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> live and walk so wide from, and <HI>contrary</HI> unto all those undeni∣able Truths, and holy Rules, so that what you preach with your <HI>Tongues,</HI> you pull down with your <HI>Hands,</HI> and your daily Conversation gives the Lye to your Profession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mast.</SPEAKER>
<P>You now grow <HI>Sawcy</HI> thus to upbraid us; we have indeed <HI>our Failings,</HI> but I hope we do not walk so <HI>Retrograde</HI> as you talk of: What Instances can you produce to main∣tain so general a Charge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Negr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intended not to <HI>upbraid</HI> you, but to satisfie my self, for per∣haps you may have <HI>some Reason</HI> that I do not know of, why you <HI>act con∣trary</HI> to what you teach; nor do I say that all, and <HI>every Christian</HI> does so,
<PB N="161" REF="81"/>
there may be Hundreds and Thou∣sands that <HI>I</HI> am not acquainted with, and there are some that I know, of whom I cannot say, but that in a very great measure they live accor∣ding to that righteous Doctrine; but for the generality or major part, I must say, That in all, and every of the aforesaid Points by you mention∣ed, the whole Tenour of their Ways, and the continual Practice of their Lives, is directly contrary to the same: And since you command me to instance Particulars, I shall endea∣vour it in some of the chief.</P>
<P N="1">1. You say, that Christian Reli∣gion teacheth <HI>to Fear the Lord,</HI> that created Heaven and Earth: The truth of this we make no doubt of; but how can we believe, that <HI>very many</HI> who go under the Name of <HI>Christians</HI> do obey this Voice of Wisdom, since they so lightly and vainly use the <HI>Name of God</HI> in their Triffling, and wicked Talk, and boldly Swear by it (and that for the most part <HI>falsly</HI> too)
<PB N="162" REF="82"/>
in their ordinary Conversation, con∣trary to his express Commands; nay, not a few, will commonly challenge the great God to <HI>Damn</HI> or <HI>Confound</HI> them, with divers other Blasphemies; And do you call this <HI>Fearing the Lord</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>be Merciful,</HI> and <HI>do as you would be done by,</HI> you in the next place assign, as a grand and important point of <HI>Christianity</HI>; but where shall we find it? We cannot perceive any thing of <HI>Mercy</HI> to dwell in your Hearts; for you commit <HI>Oppression</HI> with Violence; and that which you call <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Traffick</HI> (as 'tis manag'd amongst you) is little better than an Art of <HI>Circumventing</HI> one another; and you practise all sorts of <HI>Cruelty,</HI> not only on the inferior Creatures, but also on those of your <HI>own Kind,</HI> else what makes us your <HI>Slaves,</HI> and to be thus Lorded and Tyrannized over by you? In a word, not only <HI>We,</HI> but the whole Creation groans under your heavy Burthens; &amp; yet you tell us of your <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>good Nature,</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="82"/>
and boast of your Christian <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. You acknowledge, this divine Religion requires of you to be <HI>Sober</HI> in Meats and Drinks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not to indulge Nature with things Super∣perfluous: But does it not appear by your Conversation, that you never regard its Counsel, since your Wayes are directly opposite? Do not we see it a common Practice amongst the <HI>Christians,</HI> to drink to <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> and eat to <HI>Superfluity</HI> and <HI>Gluttony?</HI> &amp; even of those that seem most reser∣ved, scarce any, that have wherewith∣al, but will <HI>indulge themselves</HI> great variety of rich compounded Foods, and Cordial-Drinks, that contain too great Nourishment, beyond not only the <HI>Necessities,</HI> but even the <HI>Power</HI> of Nature, and the <HI>digestive Faculty</HI> of the Stomach, which produces many evil Effects; for besides the waste of the good Creatures, and a most <HI>Vn∣grateful</HI> abuse of the Creator's Mercies, it heats the <HI>Blood,</HI> makes it thick, hot and sharp, and causeth all the Mem∣bers
<PB N="164" REF="83"/>
to glow with an unnatural Heat, makes both the Body and Mind un∣easie, and disables each of them from performing its Offices as it ought, and also sets open the <HI>Gates of Venus</HI> to many lewd Practices: And thus in defiance to the Laws of your Reli∣gion, and to his own Personal hurt, one great <HI>over-grown Christian</HI> shall spend as much in <HI>one Day,</HI> to gratifie his Lusts or Vanity, as an <HI>Hundred or Two</HI> of his poor <HI>Slaves</HI> can get by their sore Labour and Sweat. And as for <HI>Exercises,</HI> there is rarely here in this Island any of the <HI>Christians</HI> that will labour, except pure Necessity con∣strain them to it, but you <HI>lay heavy Burthens</HI> on us, and as your most illu∣minated Prophet, saith, <HI>will not touch them your selves with one Finger.</HI> So that you make it a <HI>Genteel</HI> Quality, and honourable, to break and violate that great Command of the Creator in the beginning, which I have heard is recorded by a most famous Prophet of the <HI>Iews,</HI> and whom you also re∣ceive,
<PB N="165" REF="83"/>
viz. <HI>That Man should get his Bread by the Sweat of his Brows</HI>; which yet amongst the more <HI>Noble Chri∣stians,</HI> as you call your selves, is counted a <HI>poor, low, Base</HI> and <HI>shameful</HI> thing.</P>
<P>What <HI>Heathen People</HI> (as you call them) are there in the whole World, that more <HI>pamper their Carkasses,</HI> and indulge themselves like you, with things that are not needful, nor con∣venient? Do you not invent an hun∣dred Superfluities and needless <HI>Toys,</HI> to gratifie your own, and your Childrens Pallates and Sensuality? the Wind, forsooth! must not blow upon them; and as if the Earth were not good enough to bear them, nor their Legs made to carry them, you provide <HI>Horses</HI> and <HI>Coaches</HI> for them, or we poor <HI>Slaves,</HI> must lugg them about, who are as well able to go as we.

as would clothe an hundred poor Peo∣ple in modest Rayment, each far bet∣ter than hers, to defend them from the Injuries of the Elements, which is the chief end of Cloathing: Add to this, your great <HI>Palaces,</HI> and sumptu∣ous chargeable Buildings, and all kind of rich superfluous Ornaments, and <HI>Knick-Knacks</HI> in your Houses, wherein you study to out-try and ex∣ceed each other, meerly for <HI>State, Pride</HI> and <HI>vain Glory,</HI> and to be ho∣noured of men; which extravagancy is attended with another sore Evil, for that it <HI>cannot be maintained</HI> but chiefly by <HI>great Oppression</HI> of Men and Beasts; for those that spend Talents daily, must lay about them for a con∣tinual Supply, so that rather then they will be without those charge∣able Vanities, they care not how cruelly they use their Servants, and inferior Creatures; They will scourge their <HI>Slaves</HI> for a <HI>Penny,</HI> and kill their Beasts with over-labour, and at the same time spend <HI>Pounds</HI> in base

depraved Wantonness, and feasting of the Rich, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. You mention the avoidance of <HI>Evil Communications,</HI> as another duty of your Religion, which we <HI>Heathens</HI> do acknowledge, and therefore we have a Proverb amongst us, when any use lewd Discourse, to bid them, <HI>Wash their Mouthes with Water</HI>; but we have observed, that amongst the <HI>Christians</HI> there is nothing more fre∣quent than <HI>Evil Communications,</HI> whensoever any Number meet to∣gether, are not your Discourses <HI>vain, idle</HI> and <HI>frothy,</HI> and oft-times such as no <HI>modest Ear</HI> can hear without ting∣ling forth Horror and Indignation? Most of it tending to Debauchery, or injuring the good Name of Persons absent, <HI>Iesting, Lying, Vapouring,</HI> or speaking of Things and People they understand not, nor have any thing to do withal; Nay, a man cannot pass the Way or Street, but his Ears shall be grated with horrid <HI>Swearing,</HI> and <HI>ungodly Speeches,</HI> so that 'tis evident
<PB N="168" REF="85"/>
you walk in the greatest opposition imaginable to his command.</P>
<P N="5">5. You say, <HI>You are required to ob∣serve Purity, and the natural Rules of</HI> Cleanness, <HI>and to avoid all appearance of Evil</HI>: Which indeed is no inconsi∣derable point in Nature and Religion, but as far as we have been able to ob∣serve, you practise the quite contrary; for not only your Words are very un∣clean for the generality, but also in your <HI>Foods</HI> and <HI>Drinks</HI> you make no distinction, but rich provoking Food in excess, and all strong intoxicating Drinks, you desire with greedness, which over-heats the whole Body, and irritates the fierce wrathful bea∣stial Nature, whence all <HI>wanton, vain</HI> and <HI>unclean</HI> Thoughts and Imagina∣tions are generated: Also, you make as little distinction between clean and unclean <HI>Beasts</HI> as we, nay, not so much as some of our Country-men; and you eat <HI>Blood,</HI> though I have been told there is not any one thing more frequently, expresly and plainly for∣bidden
<PB N="169" REF="85"/>
in all your <HI>Bible</HI> than that; besides, you make no distinction of the Times and Seasons of the Year, when Beasts are subjects to Surfeits, and other Uncleannesses; neither are your Preparations and cooking of your Food so clean, proper and natu∣ral, as they ought to be; and instead of abstaining from all appearances of Evil, we see you court and improve them on all occasions; For do not you appoint <HI>set Meetings,</HI> and make great Feasts? to which you invite the Rich, that will invite you again, where you drink to Drunkenness, and eat to Gluttony, roaring all the while like <HI>mad Bulls,</HI> and mixing your Food with horrid Oaths, and vain Dis∣courses, the fear of the great Creator being banisht from your Hearts, nor any pity shewn to us your poor Vas∣sals, that endure the Heat of the day, and are ready to fall and faint under those heavy Burthens laid upon us, and would rejoyce to partake of <HI>the Crumbs</HI> that fall from your Tables,
<PB N="170" REF="86"/>
which you will not afford, &amp; yet spend <HI>our Sweat,</HI> and the Labours of our Hands, in all kinds of Wantonness and Superfluity, by which many of you contract such grievous Diseases, both to Body and Mind, that they become themselves more miserable then us their poor Slaves.</P>
<P N="6">6. You say that the next great point of <HI>Christian</HI> Doctrine, is to free your selves from <HI>Envy, Strife, Malice, Back-biting</HI> and <HI>Slander</HI>; which is also contradicted by your general practice; for what is more frequent amongst you than <HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Revenge</HI>? And though in your Prayers you formally use those Words, <HI>Lord forgive us our Trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us,</HI> yet at the same time Envy lies lurking in your Hearts, and the very next moment shall erect it self; for do not many of you keep your Neighbours and Brethren in loathsom Prisons for some very little offence, or in truth for none at all, but only to shew your Power, and gratifie
<PB N="171" REF="86"/>
your devilish Fury: And as for the Gentleman called <HI>Strife,</HI> he rides the Fore-horse, and is Quarter-master-General amongst you; what Fight∣ing, Swearing, Damning, Railing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is there in every House between Fathers and Children, Brothers and Sisters, Relations and Neighbours, ready to destroy and murder one ano∣ther, and all about <HI>Things,</HI> not worth a wise mans Thoughts? What swarms of Lawyers, Clerks, Pettifoggers and Idle-men, does your Strife, and un∣just Contention maintain? And how many are yearly with their Families utterly ruined thereby? <HI>I'll not leave him worth a Groat,</HI> cries one: <HI>I'll make Dice of his Bones,</HI> swears the other: <HI>Let him not in Goal,</HI> says a third. This is your Christian Charity, and Re∣mission of Injuries.</P>
<P>And for <HI>Backbiting</HI> and <HI>Slandering,</HI> even Eating and Drinking, is scarce more universally practised amongst you; almost every man speaks <HI>Evil</HI> or slighting of those that are not pre∣sent,
<PB N="172" REF="87"/>
though to their Faces he Com∣plements and Flatters them. Calum∣ny is the Sawce at your great Feasts, and Reproaches &amp; scandalous Stories the Entertainments of your <HI>Clubs</HI> and <HI>Visits,</HI> so that scarce any honest man is free from the Lashes of your in∣venom'd Tongues, or from having large Furrows plowed upon his Back, his good Name wounded, and his Reputation unjustly blasted or called in question, by your false Sto∣ries and malicious Suggestions, where∣by many are daily ruined, there being nothing more base and unmanly than these <HI>whispering Doemons</HI>; nor is there any Practice that more opposes <HI>Christianity,</HI> and the pure simple Law of God in Nature, and therefore is a Sin to be condemned forever, and banisht the Society of all good men.</P>
<P N="7">7. Not to <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>speak of things they understand not,</HI> is a very excellent Precept, yet nothing is more common among many <HI>Christians</HI> than to judge, censure, and condemn Things and
<PB N="173" REF="87"/>
Persons, though they understand them no more then a blind man can distinguish Colours, or the Deaf judge of Musick; but right or wrong without any true sight or compre∣hension, they will pass their Verdict, and shoot their Bolts, for they count their Tongues their own, and think they may say what they list, and so call <HI>Evil</HI> good, and <HI>Good</HI> evil, and abuse their own Consciences, and their Neighbours, so greatly are many of the <HI>Christians</HI> depraved.</P>
<P N="8">8. The eighth Point you menti∣oned, was, <HI>That the Lord beholds all mens Wayes and Doings, and that unto him, and his Divine Eye there is not any thing hid</HI>: Which without all doubt, is a most certain truth, which neither <HI>Christian</HI> nor <HI>Heathen</HI> dare to deny; for as your own Prophet saith, <HI>It is he that searcheth the Heart, and tryeth the Reigns.</HI> But how can we perswade our selves, that you do in truth and in earnest believe this, since we daily find that you stand more in
<PB N="174" REF="88"/>
awe of <HI>Mens seeing,</HI> or <HI>knowing</HI> your Wickedness, than of <HI>God's beholding,</HI> and revenging of it; and therefore you love to <HI>seem,</HI> and be counted <HI>Ho∣nest,</HI> and <HI>Iust,</HI> and <HI>Merciful,</HI> but scarce a Soul of you seriously endea∣vours to <HI>be so</HI>; 'tis the <HI>Name</HI> and the <HI>Credit</HI> you look after, not the <HI>Thing,</HI> which shews that you seek to please, and be well spoken of by Men, but regard not the righteous Judgment of God, who looks through the <HI>Fig-Leaves,</HI> and requires Truth and Pu∣rity in the inward parts: This Hypo∣crisie of yours is notorious, and every one almost taxes his Neighbour for it, and yet all generally practise it, and each huggs himself therein, as one of your own <HI>Poets</HI> complaineth;
<Q><L>If my foul Deeds of Darkness may</L>
<L>Be wrapt in Clouds as black as they;</L>
<L>If being ugly I can Paint,</L>
<L>And act the <HI>Devil,</HI> yet seem a <HI>Saint</HI>▪</L>
<L>Cheat and Oppress, Forswear and Lye,</L>
<L>Yet scape the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Infamy,</HI></L>
<L>I mind no further Honesty.</L></Q></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="175" REF="88"/>9. On the contrary, to <HI>believe</HI> and know (as you say) <HI>That the Lord will Retaliate every man according to his Work,</HI> is a most true and necessary Principle; but if <HI>Christians</HI> did so, surely they could not, nor would do as they do; For what kind of <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Returns</HI> do or can you expect for all your Oppressions to us your poor Vassals? For do not you oppress us at your pleasure, <HI>beat, whip, over-labour,</HI> and <HI>half-starve</HI> us, and many of you scruple not <HI>to Kill us</HI> for a small Offence, and possibly for none at all, but in your Drunkenness to sa∣tiate your fierce devilish Passions? Nor do our tender <HI>Children,</HI> and dear <HI>Wives</HI> escape your Violence. Now if Retaliation be one point of your Christian Doctrine, and every man shall be rewarded according to his Works, then what a <HI>sad Reckoning</HI> will you have to make, when God shall arise to visit for these things? And you would not certainly adven∣ture upon those things, which you
<PB N="176" REF="89"/>
must pay <HI>so dear</HI> for, either in this World, or that which is to come, if you were sufficiently sensible of the Compensation that must be made for the same.</P>
<P N="10">10. 'Tis a noble Truth, that men should walk according to the <HI>divine Principle,</HI> and <HI>forsake all Vngodliness</HI> and <HI>worldly Lusts</HI>: But the generality of <HI>Christians</HI> take contrary measures for the Gospel of Truth, neither in∣wardly nor outwardly doth teach any to <HI>compel others</HI> by outward Force to believe, and do as they do, be it right or wrong; but advises all to do as they would be done by; and to let their <HI>Moderation be known unto all men</HI>; and to <HI>bear with one another in Love:</HI> Whereas you impose upon one ano∣ther, and <HI>tye up</HI> other men to your own Conceptions, and without any Compassion or Charity▪ fall upon such as will not go your way, and do as you do, though you have nothing to object against their Lives and Conver∣sations. And whereas you acknow∣ledge
<PB N="177" REF="89"/>
the Doctrine of <HI>Christianity,</HI> where-ever it is entertained in the Love thereof, will bruise the Head of the <HI>Serpentine Nature,</HI> that is, of Lust and Uncleanness, and all Ungod∣liness, yet we see you daily wallow∣ing in all those <HI>Pollutions</HI>; so that you do not only contradict this <HI>holy Do∣ctrine,</HI> which you boast so much of, but some of you do also severely per∣secute others for <HI>obeying</HI> the same and submitting to its guidance; And as for <HI>brutish Vncleanness, Adulteries, Whoredoms,</HI> &amp;c. they are but your <HI>Sports</HI> and <HI>Pastimes,</HI> things that many of you <HI>glory in</HI>; and to be <HI>Chaste</HI> and <HI>Modest,</HI> is to be an object of your Scorn and Derision.</P>
<P N="11">11. How well you regulate your <HI>Passions</HI> (which is another thing you say Christian Doctrine teaches you) all the World sees, and we often <HI>feel</HI>; the Sea when agitated with contrary Winds, it throws up <HI>Dirt</HI> and <HI>Sand</HI> from the bottom of the Deep, and spits its <HI>froth</HI> up towards towards Hea∣ven,
<PB N="178" REF="90"/>
is not more disorderly or dan∣gerous to come near, than you are, when the least thing happens contra∣ry to your Minds, your Souls are in a perpetual Tumult, your Lusts duel one another, Covetousness fights with Luxury, Wantonness jostles Ambition, and Revenge is opposed by Cowardize; <HI>Sence</HI> gets above <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> the <HI>Man</HI> is ridden by the <HI>Beast,</HI> and when in this hurry, <HI>Conscience</HI> gets leave to be heard, then presently there is nothing but <HI>Furies</HI> and <HI>Dis∣pair</HI>: Is not all this as contrary to that <HI>Calmness</HI> and <HI>Stillness,</HI> that <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Serenity of Mind</HI> (which true Christia∣nity, both <HI>requires</HI> and <HI>gives,</HI> and is de∣lighted in) as Light is to Darkness?</P>
<P N="12">12. 'Tis as great point, and as true that men should not be <HI>too resolute,</HI> confident or conceited of their own Wisdom or Knowledge, but ought to have regard to the Lord in all their Thoughts, Imaginations and Con∣clusions, and to eye the divine Hand of <HI>Providence</HI> in all things, it being
<PB N="179" REF="90"/>
better <HI>to Fear,</HI> than <HI>to Boast.</HI> But tell us, O Master! who do violate this Rule more than the generality of <HI>Christians</HI>? Do not many of your <HI>learnd Ones</HI> boast of their Lights and Knowledge, and count all others little better than <HI>Brutes</HI> in compari∣son of themselves? And does not every one fancy his <HI>own Opinion</HI> to be the only Truth, and condemn the Sen∣timents of others, how well grounded soever they may be? And do not many endeavour to spread their No∣tions by <HI>Violence, Fighting</HI> and <HI>Op∣pression,</HI> and by Cruelty, to force all to be of their Complexion in Under∣standing? Which self-conceited Pro∣ceedings are a true <HI>token</HI> and <HI>demon∣stration,</HI> that they love to contradict the whole course of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI>; for he hath made all things <HI>to differ,</HI> and by that difference the Universe is sustained; and from those <HI>various Notes</HI> proceed the sweetest Harmo∣ny? Is it not for want of this Spirit of Humility, that you <HI>wrangle, fight,
<PB N="180" REF="91"/>
contend, punish</HI> and <HI>imprison</HI> each other, for not thinking as others do, or because they have not all one <HI>coloured Hair</HI>? For alas! men's Minds and Understandings are as different and various, as their Complexions or Vi∣sages; wherefore then are you angry with your Creator, because he hath not made you all alike? If you were not blind and ignorant, and yet very presumptuous and Self-admirers, this could never be amongst People that believe all in <HI>one Prophet,</HI> and <HI>one God</HI>: I perceive therefore it is not about <HI>true Virtue</HI> that you make all this ado in the World; 'tis for your own Conceits, your own Inven∣tions, your own <HI>Dreams,</HI> that you thus contend and disquiet your Neighbours.</P>
<P N="13">13. Your thirteenth Point of <HI>Chri∣stianity</HI> was to return <HI>God the Glory</HI> of all your Enjoyments, and relie solely upon him in your Distresses and this you observe no better than the rest; to give God the glory of
<PB N="181" REF="91"/>
your Health, Strength, Wealth, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> is to use the same <HI>soberly</HI> and <HI>discreetly,</HI> and imploy them as he hath required▪ for the benefit and advantage of our fellow Creatures, and our own Happi∣ness both here and hereafter; but you only <HI>swagger</HI> and <HI>vapour</HI> and <HI>domineer</HI> with them, as if your own right hand had <HI>made them,</HI> your own Wisdom and Power had procured them, and not as <HI>given,</HI> or rather <HI>lent</HI> you by the Lord, for the good ends before men∣tioned; whereas you use and bestow them only for <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Ostentation,</HI> for <HI>Vanity</HI> or <HI>Luxury,</HI> to accomodate your <HI>Lusts,</HI> or gratifie your <HI>Revenge</HI>; this is sure very far from a true <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> improvement of what you enjoy.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Whereas you say, your Christian Doctrine enjoyns you to be <HI>merciful to all the Inferior Creatures,</HI> and to <HI>use them with Compassion,</HI> and <HI>avoid all kind of Oppression and Violence</HI> to those of your own kind: How contrary most <HI>Christians</HI> act hereun∣to, our own <HI>woful Experience</HI> has too
<PB N="182" REF="92"/>
sadly informed us, that there is little or no Mercy or Compassion dwells in your Hearts; for on every small oc∣casion you will not only <HI>beat</HI> and <HI>op∣press</HI> us, but some of you count it no more Sin in their drunken fits to <HI>Murther us,</HI> than to kill their <HI>Horse,</HI> or their <HI>Dog</HI>; but let them know, we are humane <HI>rational Souls,</HI> and as much the <HI>Image of God</HI> as themselves, and want none of the noble Faculties, therefore our <HI>innocent Blood</HI> will equal∣ly call for <HI>Vegeance,</HI> and as powerfully as if you had killed one of the pre∣tended <HI>Christians.</HI> The Voice of God in Nature is the same; and it is not your custom of <HI>Killing</HI> will make it the more <HI>lawful</HI> or excusable in that day, when Accounts and Retaliation must be made, every Principle then apprehends and comprehends its own Children; those that have immers'd, or precipitated themselves through Violence, into the fierce Anger and wrathful Principle, shall be therein captivated even to Eternity: It is not
<PB N="183" REF="92"/>
good Words, long Prayers, and fair Speeches, that will break or untye the wrathful Net, which men all their Lives have been tying; but look what Principle has carried the upper Dominion in the Heart, to that King∣dom you belong.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>inferior Creatures,</HI> they groan under your Cruelties, you <HI>hunt</HI> them for your <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and <HI>over∣work</HI> them for your <HI>Covetousness,</HI> and <HI>kill</HI> them for your <HI>Gluttony,</HI> and set them to fight one with another till they dye, and count it a <HI>Sport</HI> and a <HI>Pleasure</HI> to behold them <HI>worry</HI> one another; whereas the same should be matter of <HI>Grief</HI> to you, to see the Gate of Wrath thus opened amongst the Creatures, and that you your selves have been the <HI>original Cause</HI> thereof, by violating the Law of your Maker.</P>
<P>Thus, Master <HI>Christian!</HI> have I briefly shewed, that in all the parti∣culars by you mentioned, the gene∣rality of you <HI>Christians</HI> do act the clean contrary; what then do you
<PB N="184" REF="93"/>
boast of, and wherein are you better than we? Only that you pretend to understand more, and <HI>do</HI> less, and so deserve the greater Condemnation. Will you make us believe, that those men have <HI>any Religion,</HI> who have <HI>no God</HI>? or have they indeed <HI>a God,</HI> who prefer their <HI>Lusts,</HI> or <HI>Wealth,</HI> or <HI>Honour,</HI> or any thing in the World before him, and his holy Commands; Can we think that you know what it is to <HI>believe</HI> that there is a God, and a Life to come, and to <HI>renounce the Flesh,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> and give up your selves to a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and a <HI>Sanctifier,</HI> when we behold you per∣suing after Vanity with <HI>out-stretched Arms,</HI> and committing all kind of Wickedness with greediness? Can you your selves think, whilst you are awake and sober, that <HI>Perfideousness</HI> will avail you, and <HI>Rebellion</HI> save you? or that the God of Wisdom, Holiness and Justice, will accept you for a <HI>perjured</HI> Profession to be, and to do <HI>that</HI> which never came into your
<PB N="185" REF="93"/>
Hearts? Is <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> a Virtue? Or will <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Dissembling</HI> bring a man to <HI>Heaven</HI>? Christianity (by that very Description you have given of it) is such a blieving in Christ, to bring us unto God and everlasting Glory, as maketh the <HI>Love of God</HI> become the very Nature of the Soul, and thankful <HI>Obedience</HI> its Imploy∣ment, and an <HI>heavenly Mind,</HI> and an <HI>humble, pure, harmless</HI> and <HI>holy Life,</HI> to be its <HI>Constitution,</HI> and <HI>constant Trade</HI>; and the Interests of fleshly Lusts, and the Pomps and Vanities, the Riches and Honours of the World to be truly esteemed but as <HI>dross</HI> and <HI>dung</HI>; Now tell us in good earnest, is <HI>this</HI> the Life which you <HI>live,</HI> or which you <HI>hate</HI>? Why will you <HI>profess</HI> a Re∣ligion you <HI>abhor</HI>? Or why will you abhor and despise a Religion which you <HI>profess</HI>? Why will you glory in the part of a <HI>Parrot,</HI> or an <HI>Ape,</HI> to say over a few Words, or move your Bo∣dies into such Forms and Ceremonies, whilst you detest the humane and
<PB N="186" REF="94"/>
divine part, to <HI>know,</HI> and <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>live</HI> to God? Do you profess your selves <HI>Christians</HI> only for <HI>Self-Condem∣nation,</HI> to be Witnesses against your selves in Judgment, that you <HI>wilfully lived</HI> Unchristian Lives? What is there in the World that you are so averse to, as to <HI>be seriously</HI> that which you profess to be? That is, to walk uprightly and sincerely in all those fourteen Particulars by you enumera∣ted. Whom do you hate more than those that are <HI>that in Heart and Life,</HI> which you call your selves in custo∣mary Words? or that are <HI>serious</HI> in the Religion which you your selves say, You hope to be saved by. Call us <HI>Heathens</HI> as long as you will, I am confident <HI>Christ</HI> hath not more bitter Enemies in the World, than some of you that wear his <HI>Livery</HI>; We <HI>Blacks</HI> are more gentle to you, than you <HI>Christians</HI> are to one another; and I have been assured, that all the <HI>Hea∣thens</HI> in the World have shed <HI>less</HI> Christian Blood, than what <HI>Hypocrite
<PB N="187" REF="94"/>
Christians</HI> themselves have greedily let out, or occasioned to be destroyed: Thus you honour <HI>dead Saints,</HI> and abhor the <HI>Living,</HI> and would gladly make more <HI>Martyrs,</HI> whilst you keep <HI>Days</HI> in Commemoration of those that <HI>others</HI> made. Can any thing be more preposterously absurd, more foolish∣ly wicked, than these <HI>interferring</HI> Contradictions? Were it not better to <HI>be</HI> what you call your selves, or to <HI>call</HI> your selves what you are? If you <HI>approve</HI> of these Christian Doctrines, why do not you square your Conver∣sations accordingly? If you think them <HI>needless Notions,</HI> why do not you disown them? Or why do you so much cry up and magnifie them? Be either <HI>Christians</HI> indeed, or cease to upbraid us for being <HI>Heathens</HI>; for such <HI>shuffling Hypocrisie</HI> is more abo∣minable to God and Man, than the most ignorant <HI>Paganism.</HI></P>

the Faculties of our Minds, our <HI>Senses</HI> and all the Furniture of Nature, are equal, and the same in us as in you: We are not <HI>Beasts,</HI> as you count, and use us, but <HI>rational Souls,</HI> and in us is contained the true Nature and Pro∣perties of all Elements, and created things; Nor do we contemn or flight the <HI>Light of the Gospel</HI>; as you call it, but we wonder at you that so much <HI>talk</HI> of it, and so <HI>little practise</HI> the good Rules of Life contained therein. Be∣sides, since you are pleased to grant us the Liberty to plead our own Cause, we might tell you, that we have the <HI>same Gospel</HI> that you so much talk of, written in our Hearts, and doing by Nature the things that are written in the Law, being without the Law, are a Law unto our selves, as one of your illuminated Prophets speaks: And if we do the things that are right in the sight of God, and walk in his innocencent Law in Nature, according to <HI>our measure</HI> and <HI>under∣standing,</HI> we have so far discharged
<PB N="190" REF="96"/>
our Duty, and we doubt not but the goodness of our Creator will accept thereof, and pardon our <HI>involuntary Misprisions,</HI> and <HI>Failings</HI>; and if you have a <HI>larger</HI> Manifestation of the eternal Light and Love of God, which we have no reason to doubt, then the more is required of you, and there∣fore the greater and more sore will your Condemnation be.</P>

<P>These, Sir! are <HI>brave things</HI> indeed to vapour with!

<PB N="193" REF="97"/>
your <HI>Shame</HI>? As for our <HI>Complexion,</HI> 'tis the Livery of our Creator, the property of the Climate and Soil, wherein his good Providence dispo∣sed of us to be born and bred; we made not our selves <HI>Black,</HI> nor do you make your selves <HI>White</HI>; wherein then have you any thing to brag of above us? If for this cause you de∣spise us; you at the same time despise that <HI>adorable Power,</HI> which is the Ma∣ker both of us and you: And thought <HI>White</HI> be an Emblem of <HI>Innocence,</HI> yet there are <HI>whited Walls</HI> filled within with Filth and Rottenness; what is only <HI>outward,</HI> will stand you in no stead, it is the <HI>inward Candor</HI> that our Creator is well-pleased with, and not the outward; have a care therefore that you be not found as <HI>black within,</HI> as we are externally.</P>
<P>You upbraid us with eating <HI>unclean Foods,</HI> Carrion, Vermine, <HI>&amp;c..</HI> But I pray, is it not your <HI>Cruelty,</HI> in not affording us what is sufficient to sup∣port Nature otherwise; that makes
<PB N="194" REF="98"/>
us do it? This is first to make us <HI>Cripples,</HI> and then beat us with our <HI>Crutches</HI> for being Lame. As for our poor Coverings, or going Naked, as long as Man remained in the innocent State, he wanted no Garments; and you are forced to <HI>Rob</HI> several sorts of Creatures to cover your <HI>Shame</HI>; nor do you bring into the World any greater <HI>Ward robe</HI> with you, than we do; nor have you occasion to carry out any more. But how depraved and dishonourable does it look, for that <HI>noble Creature,</HI> [Man] not only to be glad to borrow of his inferior Crea∣tures to hide his Shame, but also to grow <HI>Proud</HI> of those Ornaments, which are but the <HI>Spoils,</HI> or the <HI>La∣bours,</HI> and many times the <HI>Excre∣ments</HI> of Beasts and Flies, or Insects, and the like lower Graduates?</P>
<P>As for Order in <HI>Marriages,</HI> we have as much as you; for though Plurality of <HI>Wives</HI> is contrary to your Custom, it is not to <HI>ours</HI>; and he is no wise man that admires or con∣temns
<PB N="195" REF="98"/>
the various Customs of different Regions, any further than they con∣tradict Nature: Now this Custom of <HI>ours,</HI> as it is be friended with Ex∣amples amongst the antient <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> and the Laws of many Nations so re∣nowned for Civility, as to esteem all others <HI>Barbarians,</HI> so it seems some∣what to agree with the Law of <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> and to prevent Out-rages against Nature, it being not fit, nor <HI>natural</HI> for Men to meddle with their Wives when they are <HI>Breeding,</HI> or great with-child: However, these any things are more of <HI>Custom,</HI> than any thing else, and we our selves esteem that man most <HI>happy</HI> that contents himself with <HI>one Wife</HI>: But you, although your Customs and Laws forbid <HI>Poli∣gamy,</HI> and <HI>Adultery,</HI> yet whilst you comply somewhat in the former, do make nothing, many of you, to vio∣late the <HI>latter,</HI> as often as you can meet with an opportunity.</P>

Reason to believe you, from your cruel Usages, and not allowing us what is necessary for Food and Rest, which yet is to be wondred at, since if we are not worthy (forsooth!) to be your <HI>Brethren,</HI> we are however your <HI>Money.</HI> So that — this Cru∣elty towards us, doth savour more of <HI>Envy,</HI> than of <HI>Christianity</HI> or <HI>Fruga∣lity.</HI> It is also true, that we have no <HI>Lip-learned Doctors,</HI> nor are confined to the old musty Rules of <HI>Aristole</HI> or <HI>Galen,</HI> nor acquainted with the new Fancies of your modern <HI>Fire-working Chymists,</HI> or <HI>Vertuosi,</HI> nor will we compare our selves to you in those things; but we have so much under∣standing, as not to content our selves to <HI>see with other mens Eyes,</HI> and <HI>put out our own,</HI> as many of your learned <HI>Rabbies</HI> do; nor want we amongst us those that God and Nature have en∣dued with Gifts of knowing the <HI>Vertues of Herbs,</HI> and that can by ge∣nuine Skill, administer <HI>good Medicines,</HI> and perform greater Cures, than your
<PB N="197" REF="100"/>
famous Doctors with their <HI>hard Words</HI> and <HI>affected Methods.</HI> Neither will the Art of <HI>Chymistry</HI> advantage us; for since God hath hid all sorts of <HI>Meettals</HI> in the deep Bowels of the Earth, and on the contrary adorned its <HI>Surface</HI> with so many noble and salutiferous <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Plants,</HI> we conceive he intended the <HI>latter,</HI> not the <HI>former,</HI> both for the <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Physick</HI> of man; And also we observe, the most who have hazarded their Healths and Lives, to get them out of these <HI>Subterranean Caverns,</HI> have done much hurt by the use of them in the World Yet in our own Country we have in divers parts the best Met∣tals near at hand, viz. <HI>Gold,</HI> which too many of the <HI>Christians</HI> make their <HI>God.</HI> Our Women, 'tis true, have no other Ornament than what is Na∣tural, which is more than abundance of yours have, for they want the great Ornament of that Sex, <HI>Modesty</HI>; for though ours go <HI>naked,</HI> yet they are not so <HI>impudent</HI> as your Misses, who
<PB N="198" REF="101"/>
make a <HI>Trade</HI> of Lasciviousness and Filthiness.</P>
<P>We drink not Wine in Bowls, nor without; and it would be much bet∣ter and more becoming <HI>Christianity,</HI> if you <HI>did not</HI> too; for doth it not heat our Blood, irritate the central Heat, set the whole Body into an un∣natural Flame, &amp; precipitate the Mind into Fury and Madness, and excite the Senses to Uncleanness and Beastiality? For pray, good Master! tell me, how many Villanies of all sorts do some nominal <HI>Christians</HI> commit against God, and his pure Law in Nature, by reason of their Excesses in that kind? And what grievous <HI>Diseases</HI> do such Debauches occasion both pre∣sent, and for the future? Nay, to the further shame of <HI>Christians,</HI> have you not by lewd Examples <HI>defiled</HI> and <HI>debauched</HI> us <HI>Ethiopeans,</HI> and the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> amongst whom you converse? So that instead of learning us Virture, and courting us to your Faith and Religion by <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Godliness,</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="101"/>
you set before us <HI>destructive Presidents,</HI> and make us more the Children of the Devil than we were before; which has forced many of your Religion to make strict Laws, that no <HI>Christians</HI> shall suffer <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>drink</HI> strong in∣toxicating Liquors, or sell the same unto them; so that we must needs say in that respect, you have been <HI>kinder to us,</HI> than to your selves; for seeing the great Inconveniences and Hurt the drinking thereof does do us, you endeavour to prevent the same, and yet you continue and encrease the evil Practice thereof your selves, and so long as the <HI>Christians</HI> thus trade in Debauchery and Superfluity; there is no likelihood or hopes that they should draw any considerable Number of us, or the neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI> to em∣brace their Religion, though un∣doubtedly it is the most excellent Do∣ctrine that ever was communciated to the World: But the vicious Lives of its Professors, their saying, and not <HI>doing,</HI> cuts off in the Bud, and whol∣ly
<PB N="200" REF="102"/>
destroys the growth and encrease of those sublim Truths, and makes the World despise both the <HI>Christians</HI> and their Doctrine; for it is not your good Words, and long Prayers, (and indeed some are short enough) that are pleasing to our Creator, or edify∣ing to us; It must be your <HI>good Works</HI> that shall convince any of the Truth, and beget Love and Amity in all men.</P>
<P>But instead thereof, you spend your time in <HI>Riot, Excess, Vanity,</HI> or <HI>wicked Plays,</HI> whereof evil <HI>Daemons</HI> were the Inventers, whilst we <HI>sigh</HI> and <HI>groan</HI> under your heavy Burthens. But our Cries are slighted by you, and your <HI>Ladies</HI> too, who many of them will <HI>Swagger,</HI> and <HI>Curse,</HI> and <HI>Rant,</HI> and equally oppress, and as much abuse us as your selves, which Fierceness and Cruelty looks more <HI>monstrous</HI> in them, though bad in both Sexes, and where-ever practised, must of a cer∣tain truth be retaliated. I have heard some of our Master <HI>Christians</HI> talk of, and cry out against the Ty∣ranny
<PB N="201" REF="102"/>
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Slavery they impose on what <HI>Christians</HI> they can get into their Cluches at <HI>Algier</HI>; Is it not strange that you should <HI>Pra∣ctise</HI> the very same thing your selves, that you so much <HI>Condemn</HI> in others? Nay, you do <HI>ten times worse</HI> than they, both because you profess your selves <HI>Christians,</HI> which is a Religion of Love, Sweetness and Beneficience to all the Creation; and for that you use us <HI>worse</HI> than the <HI>Turks</HI> do their Servants; and especially in this, that you rather <HI>hinder,</HI> than <HI>promote</HI> our embracing the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> where∣as amongst the <HI>Turks</HI> any Christian Slave may turn <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and is encouraged thereunto, and thereby gains his Liberty.</P>

<P>True it is, the World is come to that pass, and mens Wicked∣ness is arrived to that height, that good Advertisements, and wholsom <HI>Counsel,</HI> either of <HI>Christian, Iew</HI> or <HI>Gentile,</HI> will not be entertained, let it come from whom it will, if it tend to Vertue, be sure it shall be with∣stood
<PB N="203" REF="103"/>
with various <HI>Pretences.</HI> Where∣as you accuse us of <HI>evil Carriage,</HI> and that the same hath been the Original of all our Griefs and sore Oppressions, there is a certain Truth therein, tho' not as you intend it, for if we and our Fore-fathers <HI>had not violated</HI> the innocent Law of Nature by Violence and Transgression, we had never fallen under <HI>your Yoke,</HI> nor been car∣ried away Captives out of our own Native Country; but now we have by the divine Justice been retaliated, for ours, and our Princes Transgres∣sions; However, though we acknow∣ledge this is but just from God, yet that doth not concern you, nor can you from thence justifie your Op∣pressions, which could not be occasi∣oned by the Miscarriages you speak of, because they had long been pra∣ctised upon us, <HI>before</HI> any of us made any of those ill Attempts you men∣tion; 'twas your Cruelties put us up∣on those extravagant courses: And since Oppression (according to the
<PB N="204" REF="104"/>
Doctrine of your most holy wise Pro∣phet) <HI>makes Wise Men mad,</HI> 'twas no wonder if some of our silly Country∣men were thereby so far transported, as to seek by unjustifiable means, to gain their Liberty, or a Melioration of their wretched condition.</P>
<P>Besides, if we had indeed offended you, yet you ought not to retaliate <HI>Evil for Evil,</HI> since on the contrary your Christian Doctrine enjoyns you to return <HI>Good for Evil,</HI> &amp; to <HI>love even your Enemies</HI>; how dare you then in the Light of this holy and everlasting Gospel, to talk and act after this manner? Do you indeed dream that your Cruelty, and ruling us with a <HI>martial Rod,</HI> and <HI>barbarous Fierceness,</HI> will make us <HI>Tractable</HI> and <HI>Friendly,</HI> or to love our Masters, and do our Labours with willingness? Alas! we imagined you to be greater <HI>Seers</HI> into the Mysteries of God, and his Law in Nature, than to entertain such vain and impossible Conceits; For how contrary is this not only to your
<PB N="205" REF="104"/>
Christian Principles, but also to Rea∣son, and the common Sense and Experience of all mankind? <HI>With the Froward thou shalt learn Frowardness,</HI> saith your own Prophet. And again, <HI>Did ever the Wrath of Man accomplish the Righteousness of God</HI>? Or <HI>Tyranny</HI> beget <HI>Love</HI>? If those who have the government of <HI>generous Horses,</HI> or go about to tame <HI>wild Beasts,</HI> and endea∣vour by <HI>gentle Vsage</HI> to make them tractable, and fit for Service, rather then by Cruelty and Beating; much more those who have the command of <HI>Men</HI>▪ should bring them to Order and Discipline by the mildest and fair∣est means, and all the Arts of Sweet∣ness and Perswasion; not treating them worse than <HI>Gardiners</HI> do those <HI>wild Plants,</HI> which by careful looking to, and good Usage, lose the <HI>Savage∣ness</HI> of their Nature, and in a little time come to bear excellent <HI>Fruit.</HI></P>
<P>In vain therefore you go about to excuse your Tyranny and Oppression towards us, by making the World
<PB N="206" REF="105"/>
believe, that you are as it were con∣strained, or forced to be cruel to us; Though yet the same be true in one Sense, <HI>viz.</HI> you are irritated there- unto from you own innate awakened <HI>Wrath,</HI> which does predominate in your Hearts and Souls, and then those fierce Arrows of <HI>Mars,</HI> and Poysons of <HI>Saturn,</HI> which you let fly at us, do by simily stir up the origi∣nal Venoms, and wrathful Qualities <HI>in us</HI>: And this, and this only, is it that hath occasioned some of the <HI>worser sort</HI> of our Country-men to Curse you and your Posterity, and to endeavour to kill and destroy you, which is a <HI>crying Sin,</HI> which we nei∣ther justifie, nor can execute, since 'tis condemned by God, and his Law in Nature; And all that have attempted such savage Mischiefs, ought not to go unpunisht, neither will they; for the just Law of Retaliation will take hold them; but will you therefore punish the Innocent for, or with the <HI>Guilty</HI>? because some called <HI>Christians</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="105"/>
commit <HI>Murders</HI> and <HI>Treasons,</HI> must all of that Profession be cut off by the <HI>Ax,</HI> or the <HI>Gibbet</HI>? If you will deal ingenuously, your own Hearts will tell you, that the occasion of these Evils committed, or endeavoured to have been committed, arise from your <HI>Sins,</HI> and the great <HI>Abuses</HI> wherewith you have from time to time afflicted us, <HI>viz.</HI> your Mur∣dering us at your pleasure, and no Account or just Compensation ren∣dred for the same. Therefore does our innocent Blood call for Venge∣ance on you, and (without serious Repentance and Amendment) must be reckoned for. Consider well these things, and then tell us; Do you think, or can you in Reason, but ex∣pect, that the great Tyranny, In∣justice, and cruel Usages you have practised upon us, will in due time be brought back upon you and your Land or Posterity, if you do not atone for these Evils, and give us Ease and Refreshment? And though
<PB N="208" REF="106"/>
we are never so submissive, can not the kindled Wrath raise up other Ene∣mies to destroy you and yours in a Moment? Therefore be intreated to bethink your selves in time, for un∣doubtedly the Cup of Wrath is almost full.</P>

If we should <HI>leave off</HI> these Practices, how should we <HI>live at the Rate</HI> we do? fill our Tables daily with variety of costly Dishes, and swill our selves and numerous Visitants with <HI>rich Wines,</HI> and other strong Liquors: How should we maintain our Gran∣dure, and our Pomp, and raise great <HI>Estates</HI> for our selves and Children, and leave our Posterity great, and rich, and honourable in the World?

As for maintining <HI>Pride, Superfluity,</HI> and other Evils of that nature, I am of your mind, that they cannot be supplied without Oppres∣sion and Violence; for all <HI>Extreams</HI> beget their Likenesses: But sure you <HI>Christians</HI> above all others, ought not to regard such <HI>Vanities,</HI> but relinquish and detest all Superfluity, Pride, Gluttony, and other the like Intem∣perances, since they are so diametri∣cally opposite to your Profession and Religion. Besides, you abuse your selves and Posserity, by thinking to raise great <HI>Estates,</HI> or derive any last∣ing
<PB N="211" REF="107"/>
Temporal Happiness to you or them, by over-charging us with labour; For does not Reason and Experience let you know, that Houses built with <HI>mouldering Stone</HI> and <HI>rotten Timber,</HI> will not long continue; and that Estates heap'd together by Vio∣lence, carry along with them <HI>a Curse</HI> and are blasted from the <HI>Radix,</HI> so that at most they seldom descend to the <HI>third Heir,</HI> and rarely out-live the first or second Generation?

Are they not all long since crusht to pieces by one another, because their Foundations were laid in Violence and Spoil, Injustice and Oppressions? The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who baptized the <HI>New World</HI> in <HI>Blood,</HI> murdered many <HI>Hundred Thousand Indians,</HI> on pretence of propagating the Christian Religion, when in truth
<PB N="212" REF="108"/>
it was only to get <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Empire</HI>; Have they not met with Retaliation? Have they not decreased in Power <HI>ever since</HI> those Cruelties, and instead of grasping an <HI>universal Monarchy,</HI> (which their Ambition promised themselves) are now scarce able to defend their own antient Patrimony, or keep off an Enemy from the Fron∣tiers of <HI>Castile</HI>? If all these <HI>mighty Men of War</HI> have <HI>Shipwrackt</HI> by <HI>steer∣ing this Course,</HI> how hope you with your petty <HI>Pinnaces,</HI> and tottering <HI>Skiffs,</HI> to avoid the like Tempests? If just Vengeance hath overturned whole Empires and Kings, that cal∣led themselves <HI>Invinceable,</HI> for their Cruelties and Oppressions, how shall your <HI>private Fortunes</HI> be establisht, that have no other Foundation but the like Violence and Injustice?</P>
<P>On the other side, I pray observe, there are many <HI>honest, compassionate,</HI> and truly <HI>Christian</HI>-spirited Men amongst you, that do not willingly oppress either Man or Beast, and yet
<PB N="213" REF="108"/>
you see how they are blest, and pros∣per, and enjoy more true Content and Happiness in one Week, than you whose Minds are continually distracted with greedy Desires, or anxious Fears, do in all your Lives; Nor are any of your Estates so firm∣ly establisht, as those whose Posses∣sors use Mercy and Gentleness in all their Doings; for Vertue and Well∣doing will as naturally attract the Influences, and favour both of God and Man, and of the <HI>Coelestials,</HI> as well as inferior Creatures, as a <HI>Load∣stone</HI> does <HI>Iron</HI>: And whosoever en∣deavours sincerely to live according to the innocent Law of God in Na∣ture, shall be filled with good things, but those that study to grow rich by Wickedness and Oppression, shall be sent <HI>empty away,</HI> and both their Estates and their Hopes be scattered like <HI>Leaves</HI> before the Wind.</P>
<P>Nor is your Practice herein less Impudent than Ungodly, all Wicked∣ness being indeed the height of Folly,

and Piety and Vertue evermore the <HI>best Policy.</HI> For why should you oppress us, by whose Labours you are sustained? And our Ill is your Loss, are we not your <HI>Money</HI>? And what a small matter more than you allow us, might plentifully supply us? As suppose such Masters as have Fifty, a Hundred or two Hundred <HI>Negroes,</HI> if they would add to our Allowance, Fifty, or one Hundred, or two Hundred Pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> it might maintain us in lively Strength, and sufficient Vigour to go through with our Labour with cheerful Spirits, and brisk Dispositi∣ons; then should our Souls (instead of <HI>Cursing,</HI> and calling for Vengeance upon you) <HI>Bless</HI> you, and serve you cordially and willingly, with all our Power. For those that are wise amongst us, matter not their Free∣dom so much, provided they might but be admitted such necessary Sup∣ports, Priviledges and Accomoda∣tions, as our bountiful Creator by his

Hand-maid, <HI>Nature,</HI> has plentifully provided for all his Creatures, and especially for the race of Men: And then would you have Peace in your own Houses and Spirits, whereas now you are always filled with Con∣tention, Anger, Strife, Jealousie or Suspitions; nor need you ever then fear our <HI>Rising</HI> up against you, to cut you off, or any other Invasion; for nothing does so much disarm the Rage of the fierce Wrath, as Well-doing and Innocency; these being the surest Bulwarks both against in∣ward and outward Enemies.</P>

have been heard to say, <HI>That they would as soon, and willingly trust their Lives with some of their</HI> Ne∣gro Slaves, <HI>as with the most trusty</HI> Christian Servants <HI>they had.</HI> And I doubt not, but if our Masters deal justly, and with tenderness preserve us, by allowing us such suitable Food, Drinks and Rest as are needful for the support of our Lives and Health, and suitable to the Climate, we should <HI>all in general</HI> become more tractable, obedient and diligent, and thereby not only perform our Labour much better, but secretly attract the sweet Influences of God and Nature on their Heads, and then twenty of us would dispatch as much Work and Business as thirty do, or can do, that have neither Food that is proper, either in Quantity or Quality, nor <HI>due Rest,</HI> for want of which, the whole frame of the Body, and all the Members grow heavy, dull, weak and heartless, and the Mind indispo∣sed and averse from, as well as un∣able
<PB N="218" REF="111"/>
for Work or Business, which can never go on well, and to satis∣faction, where the chief motive is <HI>Whip</HI> and <HI>Spur,</HI> Fear on the one side, and Cruelty on the other.</P>
<P>Besides, if we and our <HI>Wives</HI> were kept in good Heart, we should be able to get not only <HI>more strong</HI> and <HI>healthy</HI> Children, but <HI>more in Number,</HI> which would supply your Business far better, than for you every Year to be at that great Charge of buying such Numbers of <HI>new Negroes,</HI> of whom many fail, and many dye upon the change of Climate; For by rea∣son of the Hardships used to us, and especially the Cruelties towards our Wpmen, during their Pregnancy, they so often <HI>Miscarry,</HI> that we upon the Island cannot keep our Number, but decrease so fast, that you are forced every Year (at vast charge) to fetch about <HI>ten Thousand</HI> (as I have heard) new Ones; whereas there is no doubt to be made, but if we were conveniently supplied with Food and
<PB N="219" REF="111"/>
competent Rest, and some due Re∣spect or Commiseration had to our <HI>Wives when they are big,</HI> then every of our Masters Families would so en∣crease by his <HI>own Bread,</HI> that there would be no more occasion for buy∣ing of new Ones, which would won∣derfully enrich you; so that if either you regard the Rules of your <HI>Holy Religion,</HI> and will not justly be bran∣ded for <HI>Hypocrites</HI> or <HI>Atheists</HI>; If you have any respect to <HI>Humanity,</HI> com∣mon <HI>Honesty,</HI> and that universal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rin∣ciple (but almost universally neg∣lected) <HI>to do as you would be done by</HI>; or lastly, if you would avoid <HI>divine Vengeance,</HI> in Retaliation for your Oppressions, and would justly en∣crease your Estates by such ways, as they may be a comfort to your selves, and continue to your Posterity: If all or any of these thing, I say, have any weight with you, then speedily leave off your Severities, and let your usage of us be such as is fit for <HI>Men</HI> to practise towards <HI>Men,</HI> let us see the
<PB N="220" REF="112"/>
excellency of the Christian Religion, by the goodness of your <HI>Lives</HI> that profess it, by your Meekness, and Charity, and Benignity, and Com∣passion towards your fellow Crea∣tures, especially those of the same Species with your selves, and who have no less rational and <HI>immortal Souls</HI> than the best of you: If these things you do, we and our Posterity shall <HI>willingly serve you,</HI> and not count it any <HI>Slavery,</HI> but our unspeakable Happiness; <HI>Peace</HI> shall be in your Dwellings, and <HI>Safety</HI> shall surround your Island, for Innocency is a better defence than Forts and Citadels, than Armies and Fleets, than <HI>Walls of Brass,</HI> flankt with <HI>Towers of Adamant</HI>: In a word, you shall have Satisfaction <HI>within,</HI> and Security <HI>without,</HI> and en∣joy the Blessings both of <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Eternity.</HI> But if neither the Voice of <HI>Religion,</HI> nor <HI>Nature,</HI> can be heard; If neither <HI>Humanity</HI> nor <HI>Self-interest</HI> can prevail with you, be assured, that although you are wilfully <HI>Deaf,</HI> our

great Creator will be ready to <HI>hear</HI> our Cries; and you must certainly one day make Retaliation to the ut∣termost Farthing.</P>

<P><HI>Sambo</HI>! I have hearkened attentively, and well considered your Discourse, which carries with it such Evidence and Reason, that I must acknowledge I am convinced that our former Conduct towards you, has not been agreeable to our Religion, or common Equity; there∣fore for my own part, you shall see by <HI>future Vsage,</HI> what <HI>Impression</HI> your Words have made upon me, nor shall I be wanting to acquaint <HI>others</HI> with what you have offered— It grows late, therefore you were best be gone, and betake your self <HI>to Rest.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Boon</HI> Master, I return you a thousand of <HI>Thanks</HI> for the freedom you have given me of speaking to you: And I am over∣joyed to hear, that you have thereby
<PB N="222" REF="113" MS="y"/>
received some <HI>satisfaction</HI>; I shall now return to my fellow Servants; and as I have used some Arguments to you to be kind to them, so I shall on all occasions press them with Ar∣guments to be obedient, humble, just and respective to all their Masters.</P>
