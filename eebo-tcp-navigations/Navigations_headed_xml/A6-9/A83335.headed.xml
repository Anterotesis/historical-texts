<PB REF="3"/>support of life, and which is like to be of very dangerous conse∣quence in the influence which it may have upon the necessities of the meaner sort. And wheras it is also very dangerous to adventure shipping within the command of the Forts there erected, as being subjected to a surprize, and like enough to be made use of against the safety of the kingdome, if they should make their voyage onely man'd as usually for trade; And how great use hath been made of the port of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> to the danger of the kingdome, since it came into the hands of the said Earle is manifest to all. It is therefore hoped that there are none that will be backward to contribute their best assistance towards the reducing of that place, in the recovery whereof all men are interessed, and the rather for the opportunity that is now given, if it be speedily undertaken, and effectually prosecuted. And whereas in obe∣dience to an Order of the House of Commons the Committee of the Navy communicated their opinions in writing to the Lord Major of <HI>London</HI> by what meanes the said City may be furnished with Coales, with desire that his Lordship would impart the same to the Aldermen of that City, or such other persons as his Lord∣ship should thinke fit, which Writing with the Petition and Pro∣positions of divers Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> were read at a Common-Councell, held at <HI>Guildhall</HI> in <HI>London</HI> she twentieth of this moneth, where the said Court taking all the premises into their serious consideration did conceive that this great worke might be effect∣ed if both Houses of Parliament should thinke fit to approve of these ensuing Propositions.
