<HEAD>THE <HI>FIRST LECTƲRE</HI> TOUCHING NAVIGATION: <HI>Read Publiquely at</HI> Sir Balthazar Gerbiers Academy:</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The Introduction</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Ike as the Deep doth at all times declare the marvellous wonders of that great Authour, Guider, and Preserver of all things; so it must needs be a marvellous occupation; neither can it bee but most glorious to the minde of any creature, to exercise it self on that subject whereon the Spirit of God was pleased to move, before all things were.</P>
<P>Certainly <HI>Navigation</HI> (whereof wee shall now treat) cannot but afford a glorious delight to the mindes of Lovers of Knowledge; as the Seas afford a world of Wealth unto those that make <HI>Navigation</HI> their Profes∣sion.</P>
<P>Is it not as rare as wonderfull, that with an Instrument so little as an <HI>Astralabo</HI> is, and that with a Sea compasse.</P>
<P>By the first you may measure the Circles of the Hea∣vens, the height and distance of the Sunne, and Starres.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P> By the second, (which hath neither mouth, tongue, legges, nor hands) man is directed, guided, and shewne where the East, West, North, and South are (not only in the steddiest case a vessel can be, but when the moved waves tosseth the same as it were towards the clouds, and thence lets it reele as into an Abysse) its no wonder then that <HI>Solomon</HI> the wisest of all men said, that the hardest thing to be found, was the way a Ship makes through the Seas. And is not the wonder so much the greater, that it findes its streight course through that vast perpetuall moving, and removing body, so exactly, when the Firmament appeares as black as Inke, and all the lights of Heaven are covered with the darknesse of the night, (like as with an extinguisher) as well as in the clearest day.</P>
<P>Is it not a wonder above all wonders, that after so ma∣ny moneths Navigations, and that after such varieties, changes of winds, intermixture of stormes, the violence of Tides, so constantly changeable, that a vessel arrives to the mouth of an Harbour, as streight as if it were a Ferry Boat drawn by a cord, fastned from one shoare to the other.</P>
<P>With the royall Prophet <HI>David,</HI> let all men say; <HI>Qui descendunt mare in Navibus, facientes operationem in a∣quis multis, ipsi viderunt opera Domini, &amp; mirabilia ejus in profundo dixit,</HI> &amp; <HI>stetit spiritus procella: Et exaltati sunt flu∣ctus ejus. Ascendunt usque ad Coelos,</HI> &amp; <HI>descendunt usque ad abyssos, anima eorum in malis tabescebat: Turbati sunt,</HI> &amp; <HI>motisunt sicut ebrius,</HI> &amp; <HI>omnis sapientia e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum devorata est. Et clamaverunt ad Dominum eum tribularentur,</HI> &amp; <HI>de neces∣sitatibus eorum eduxit eos. Et statuit procellam ejus in auram,</HI> &amp; <HI>siluerunt fluctus ejus,</HI> &amp; <HI>laetati sunt quia siluerunt,</HI> &amp; <HI>de∣duxit eos in portum volantatis eorum, confiteantur Domino
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>misericordiae ejus,</HI> &amp; <HI>mirabilia ejus filiis hominam.</HI> That is They that goe downe to the Sea in ships, that doe busi∣nesse in great waters, these see the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep; for he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof; they mount up to the Heaven, they goe down againe to the depths, their soule is melted because of trouble, they reele to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end; then they cry unto the Lord in their distresses. He maketh the storme a calme, so that the waves thereof are still; then are they glad because they be quiet, so he bringeth them unto their desired haven: O that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 107.</P>
<P>Let us then so profit by this present meditation, wherein we shall finde the great benefit of the Art of Navigation, in that it doth not only serve for the trans∣portation both of men and goods, from the remotest parts of the world, and towards the which God was not pleased to prescribe any high wayes, for Carts, nor For∣ces; but to make men acquainted with all such parts, in which God doth manifest the varieties of his power, and of his bottomles treasures; even so doth he likewise with Nations, in some of which his divine fatherly mercy is glorified, and his Justice made more apparent, rendring man also more capable to participate of those innume∣rous riches; by all what the Indian precious shoares are garnished with, by all the golden bowels of the earth, where Nature by the Sun-beams is made capable of such productions, by what the Mother-wombe of pearls is possest with, by that wherewith <HI>Aarons</HI> breast was made so shining glorious; men load their Vessels as freely
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>as Carts on other grounds, with the most ordinary fruits, and productions of the earth.</P>
<P>Navigation may therefore well be termed the most profitable of all Sciences, and Arts, for man-kinde; if he can make that use of it, as may justly draw blessings unto him; which is to be compast by doing that, so ear∣nestly wisht for by the aforesaid King <HI>David; O that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men.</HI></P>
<P>And by being as ready to labour in his cause (in which no Soule can suffer any ship-wrack) as to hazard Life, Ship, and Goods, for transitory things.</P>
<P>We shall begin with the Sea, and say first what it is, and why it is called Ocean.</P>
<P>The Sea is all the vast extent of water which environs the earth.</P>
<P>The waters were created by God, <HI>In principio creavit Deus coelum &amp; Terram, &amp; Spiritus Domini ferebatur super aquas.</HI> In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. This is confirmed by the writs of <HI>Moses,</HI> in his generation, or off-spring of this world.</P>
<P>The Water doth engender, and maintaine it self in the Sea; the Rivers come from it, and return unto it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aegyptians</HI> have supposed foure Elements, of each one whereof they made two; the one Male, and the other Female: they beleeve that the Aire which engen∣ders the wind is the Male, and that which is loaden with clouds, and which doth not stirre, to be the Female; they call the Water male, and all other Waters female; they say that the fire (the flame whereof burnes) is male, and that which shineth (without doing harme) is the female. They doe beleeve that the hardest Earth,
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>as the Stones, and Rocks are males, and give the name of female to that which is manuable.</P>
<P>The Sea is called Ocean, by reason of its quick and continuall motion; for <HI>Oris</HI> in Greek, is to hasten, or else it's called, <HI>Ocean quasi Cianeus,</HI> for it embraces the Rivers of the earth.</P>
<P>The Sea receives severall names from the diversity of places, by the which it passeth, as the Sea of <HI>China, India, Persia,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Sea properly hath no colour, for our sight doth not remaine on the superficies of the water, but descends lower, and at a great distance its colour is like that of Heaven, but being disturbed by the Winds it is suscep∣tible, of divers colours.</P>
<P>It's to be noted, that the Sea riseth, increasing seven dayes, which is called quick water, and seven other dayes it retires decreasing, which is called dead water. <HI>Aristotle</HI> treats of the causes of the increasing and decrea∣sing in the second of the Meteors; as also <HI>Hippocrates</HI> in the Booke of the Aire, and Waters; where he sayes, that there is a proper cause of Astrologie, <HI>viz.</HI> by the na∣turall vertue which the Moone hath on the Waters; therefore we see all that's in the Sea increaseth, and de∣creaseth, as the Moone doth; for as the Moone happens to rise on the Horizon, and that she toucheth the Sea with her beames, so doth she raise a surging on the Sea, which causeth its increase, and decrease; the which shall be more largely discus'd in its proper time, and place.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>How the Sea belongs to the Perfection of the world, that it would have perished without the same, and how the waters are ingendered by the Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THe World could not have been perfect without the Sea, for that if there were no beginning of waters, there would bee no simple water; and if there were no simple water, there would be no mixt water; and so there could not be any thing of that which is ingendered by water. And if there were no water found, nothing consisting of a body could bee continued, or congluti∣nated.</P>
<P>If there were no beginning of Waters, generation would be destroyed, and consequently all the World. Neither without the beginning of Waters could all the assemblings of contraries be performed; though they are possible.</P>
<P>Thus nature would be deficient in those things which are unavoidably necessary, and conducing to the same. And its property, and vertue failing, the waters would be hindered in their action, by which it would happen (there being no beginning of waters) that the workman∣ship of nature would perish, and consequently the whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> (in the second of the <HI>Meteors</HI>) sayes, that the <HI>Waters of the Seas ingender in the North:</HI> He would say, that the greatest part of the waters of the Sea are ingendred in the North. As <HI>Albert</HI> the great declares (in the se∣cond of the <HI>Meteors</HI> the sixth Chapter, where he sayes) that the Sea runs from the North to the South, and the cause is, that the Sea is higher in the North, then to∣wards the South; and the reason why it is higher, is, be∣cause
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>that the cold of the North ingenders more water than the Sea can contain in the space, distance, and height, of its coast there. The water which is in the South is consumed and diminished by the heat of the Sun, there∣fore one part of the South water, drives the other back towards the lowermost side, yet neverthelesse either mo∣veth accidentally from the place of their generation, be∣cause that which is moist runs to be retained in the dry part.</P>
<P>The reason why the water consumes it selfe so much in the South, is, because the Sunne turnes alwayes in his excentrique circle: and that its center is not the same with that of the Earth, so that if the Diameter, of the cir∣cle of the sun were passed between two Diameters, its cen∣ter and that of the Earth, the greatest part of the Diameter would be at one side, and the lesser at the other, in con∣sideration of the Center of the Earth.</P>
<P>And thus it is Geometrically demonstrated, that the greatest length of the Diameter is neare the twen∣tieth degree of <HI>Gemini,</HI> and that the least length of it is at the twentieth degree of <HI>Sagitarius,</HI> its opposite signe. It appeares then, that the Sunne approaches nearer unto the Earth in the Southerne parts then in the Northerne; and thus by its approaching the South, heats it so violent∣ly, that it consumes the water, and scorches the Earth, which it doth not at the North.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Wherefore the Water of the Sea is brinish and salt, and that such Water is best for Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>THe matter which causes the Sea to be brinish, and salt, is, because that there are two sorts of vapours in the Sea, <HI>viz.</HI> Hot, and Moist; and Hot, and Dry: The
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>one whereof evaporates it selfe from the superficies of the Sea, and the other raiseth it selfe from its bottome, by force of the Sunne, and Stars, which are the effici∣ent causes of its vapours, and because that the vapour of the water is very subtle, between these two, therefore it elevates it self in the Aire, and is consumed by the Sun, and there remaineth nothing else but the exhalations of the Earth, the which are dissipated, extended, and mingled among the water, as appeares by the exam∣ple of those who eate, for the digested meat, spreads and divides it selfe through the members, and all the grosse and undigested substance remains: In the like manner also, the vapour of the Earth, having extended it selfe, re∣maines mixt with the substance of the Sea water, and the coldnesse of the Water drives in so coldly, as it con∣sumes it selfe by its owne coldnesse, because of its min∣gling by Antyperistasis, which is to say, that two contra∣ry things joyned together, become stronger then before, for the heat of the exhalation (which issues from the bot∣tom of the Sea) fortifies it self by the vertue of the Sun, with its contrary, to wit, the coldnesse, and thus the Heat happens to overcome, which is the necessary opera∣tion towards the begetting of the saltish water.</P>
<P>It is also more convenient for Navigation, that the water be saltish then fresh, for the saltish water is heavi∣er then the fresh: That it is so, is proved by many expe∣riences, as for example, this one: Take Fresh water, and mingle it with a good quantity of salt, so that the Salt may melt, and be dissolved into water, then take a Fresh eg, and put it on the mixt water, the thicknes of the water (which proceeds from the mixture of the Salt) wil bearup the egg by its thicknes, &amp; wil cause it to swim over it, the which in fresh water would descend to the bottom.
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>By this same experience it may likewise be demonstrated that a vessel will sinck sooner in Fresh water then in Salt water, for the fresh water divides it selfe both sooner, and closes with greater ease then the salt water doth. So as by the driving of the egg on the salt water, the ar∣gument may be likewise strengthened: That the saltish∣nesse in the Sea water is not divided, but that the whole Sea throughout, its water is as well salt at the bottome, and in the middest, as on the superficies; And there∣fore the opinion of some Philosophers, that the sea wa∣ter should be fresh at the bottome, is frivolous, being that the Sea-Fish is no more salt then those of fresh water Rivers: And that the reason thereof should be, that the fish make their litter and feed in the bottome, which being but a slight argument, it will be necessary to say only this thereon.</P>
<P>That though the body of the Sea moves in an entire masse, by its ebbing and flowing, yet since its a liquid body, it cannot chuse (being so much agitated by the winds) but be generally salt: And the which cannot be contradicted by so weak a conceit as that the sea-fish are not salt, because they feed at the bottome of it. God hath given unto the Elements their due propriety, as wel as unto all the creatures, and likewise to all the produ∣ctions, both of the earth and sea: And there is no more contradiction of a possibility in Fish that live in salt wa∣ter to have a fresh taste, then that the moysture which proceeds from the <HI>Muscadine Spanish</HI> grape, should be drawne from the same soyl, whereon the bitter Almond, Olive, and the balmish Nuts oyle doth grow, whose severall productions are according to that property which God hath been pleased to bestow on them.</P>
<P>The Earth it selfe is salt, which the Scripture notes,
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>for if the earth loseth its Salt, wherewith shall it be sea∣soned; and yet the same earth produceth Sugar, though a Salt to preserve Fruits; and contrary to the Salt of the Sea, &amp;c. And likewise severall other things, out of which though Salt might be drawn, yet they have not the faltish taste, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the different Motions which are in the Ocean.</HEAD>
<P>GReat part of the Waters are ingendered in the North, and runs from the North towards the South as aforesaid, (which is one of the Seas motions) When the Tide increaseth, we see the sea mounts at one side, and when it decreaseth, its motion is quite contrary, and it begins first to decrease where it had the first increase; and thus it appears that the sea hath contrary motions, and different the one from the other,</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> sayes, that there is no other cause of the cur∣rent of Waters from one place to another, then the height and lownesse of places; that only motion excep∣ted by the which the Sea increaseth, and decreaseth; for (as aforesaid) it followes the course of the Moone, for the waters of the Sea increase, and decrease in all the parts of the World, that is to say, in the East, West, North, and South; therefore the Sea hath no proper place from whence it begins its increasing, or decreasing, but moveth accidentally from one part to the other, unlesse it be downwards towards the bottome; for that such a motion doth not happen accidentally, but by the proper essence agreeing to its forme.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>How it chanceth that the Sea doth neither over-flow, augment, nor inlarge it selfe.</HEAD>
<P>THe cause why the Sea doth not over-flow, augment, nor inlarge it selfe, though so much water is engen∣dered in it, and that it doth continually receive so many Rivers and Fountaines into it; is, that the Sea is the natu∣rall receptacle of all the Waters, and their proper reti∣ring and resting place, and therefore it doth not over∣flow, nor inlarge it selfe; for that no place can drive back, nor hinder the entrance of that thing which by nature ought to be in her, since naturally the place ought to conforme it selfe unto that which it incloseth; like as the Sea, which being capable to receive into her all the Rivers, and neverthelesse for their entrance doth not over-flow, nor augment. Also the Sea doth not o∣verflow, because it is of such a vast extent, that the Rivers are as nothing in consideration to it. The third reason is, because that the heat of the Sun, and the breath of the Wind, consumes such a quantity of Water, that though the Sea continually engenders, and that the Rivers in∣cessantly run into it; yea God hath ordained, that it should not lessen, nor augment, as it is written in <HI>Job, Lord, thou hast set a limit, the which it shall not passe.</HI> The holy Writ sayes in <HI>Genesis,</HI> that the water of the Deluge, did rise fifteene Cubits over the highest Hils under the Heavens, insomuch that all the Earth was covered with water. But though this increasing of water was so great, yet neverthelesse the Sea did not over-flow the Earth, by transgressing its limits or bounds.</P>
<P>The increasing of those Waters proceeded from two causes; the one was, that <HI>the windowes of Heaven were
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>opened,</HI> as the Text sayes, <HI>and it rained on the earth forty dayes, and forty nights exceedingly;</HI> the other was, that the Fountaines, Rivers, and Currents did over-flow, in∣somuch that the earth was by them covered, as aforesaid, <HI>and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground,</HI> except <HI>Noah,</HI> who only remained alive, and they that were with him in the Arke; and after∣wards the same Text sayes, <HI>that God caused a wind to passe over the earth, which abated the waters; the raine from Hea∣ven was also restrained, and the earth returned to its first being.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the antiquity of Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>GOd the Creator of the universall World, did ordaine the making of the first Vessel, as it is written in the sixth Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> that God commanded <HI>Noah</HI> to make an Arke of Gopher wood, and to pitch it within, and without with pitch; the length of the Arke was of three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lydians</HI> were the first inventers of Ships, but their skill only extended it selfe to joyne one beame to ano∣ther well nailed, and well caulked, with which they ven∣tured to Sea; afterwards <HI>Epaminondas</HI> did set forth Ves∣sels in a greater perfection to saile withall, so that the famous Captaine <HI>Bias</HI> was seene in the Peloponensian War, both with Ships, Charricks, and Gallies.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> King of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> sent two Ships into <HI>Tharsis,</HI> which both went and returned each third yeare, and brought Gold, Silver, Ivory, and divers other things.</P>
<P><HI>Julius Solinus</HI> sayes, that all the Meridian Sea which embraces <HI>Africa,</HI> was sayled about from the <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>
<P> <HI>Pliny</HI> writes in his second Booke, the threescore and seventh Chapter, that in his time all the circuit of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>France</HI> was sayled about, and likewise all the West.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Plato's</HI> time, there were Vessels that sayled from the Isle of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> which is at the entry of the Straits of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> to the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> did governe the Empire, there were seene in the Arabian Sea, ensignes of Vessels floa∣ting, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had lost.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> the greatest part of the Ocean Sea was sayled through.</P>
<P>When <HI>Seleucus</HI> and <HI>Antiochus</HI> did reigne, all the coast of the Caspian Sea was sayled through, and knowne by the Macedonian Armies.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Switzerland</HI> gave to <HI>Metellus</HI> some <HI>Indians,</HI> which sayling with Merchandises, were driven by a Tempest from their Country to <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the Teutonicall Emperours, there were <HI>East Indian</HI> Embassadours found on the <HI>Germaine</HI> coast, which were driven thither by the violence of the wind.</P>
<P>Some Authors write of great numbers and multitude of Ships which were in ancient times, as those of the <HI>Assyrians, Persians, Grecians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> writes, that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Navie which came to <HI>Troy,</HI> consisted of one thousand, one hundred, and foure∣score Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> came with five thousand, five hundred Ships, seven hundred thousand men, and three hundred thousand of his friends and allies, to the destru∣ction of <HI>Greece,</HI> and being come to the Pontick Sea, he made a Bridge of Ships over it, on the which he passed with his Army.</P>

<HEAD>The use of Navigation</HEAD>
<P>IS cheifly to descry the dangers which are by the way, as Rocks, Sands, and such other like impediments, and to know how to avoid them: How far the places are di∣stant, what wind or point of the Compasse serves to fail unto them; and also when the windes fall out crosse by the way, to consider how to direct the Vessell, and to take the most advantagious course to attaine unto the in∣tended Port in a convenient time. And if any stormes happen by the way, to indeavour the preservation of both Ship and goods, and to bring her safe unto the Port assigned.</P>

<HEAD>How to fore-see Stormes by the Signes of the Sunne and Moone.</HEAD>
<P>SEverall stormes, both at high winds, and troubled raging Seas, often fall out, whereby both the losse of ships, and perill of the Sea mens lives are threatned, and other eminent dangers: We will declare by what signes they may bee foreseen; and first by observations on the Sunne.</P>
<P>At the sunne rising, if you perceive before it reddish Clouds, and that they drive, some towards the North, and some towards the South, signifies winds and great Raines.</P>
<P>If before the sunne rising, you see some round clouds hover about it, withdrawing towards the South after that the Sunne is risen, it signifies great cold, but if they doe withdraw towards the Sunne setting, they signifie faire weather.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>
<P> When the Sun spreads its beams far through the Aire, and that there seems to be some hollownesse in it, near the middle of the Sunne, that signifies Raine.</P>
<P>When ere the Sunne rises, its beames are perceived, that signifies Raines, and Winds.</P>
<P>When the Sun sets having its circle white, that signifies stormes for the night insuing.</P>
<P>When the Sun is faire and cleare, without casting any extraordinary heates at its rising, that signifies a faire and cleare day, If it seemes to be yellow, it then signifies rain and Haile.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Severall signes by the Moone.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Egyptians</HI> observe the fourth day of the Moone, and if then she is resplendent with a clear light, they infer then, that it signifies faire weather.</P>
<P>That when the Moon is red, it then signifies winds.</P>
<P>That when she is browne, and darkned; it then signi∣fies raine.</P>
<P>When at the Full Moone it is cleare and bright in the middle; they say then that it signifies Faire weather.</P>
<P>When at the Full Moone it hath a Circle about it, Its then a signe, that the wind will proceed from that part where she is most resplendent.</P>
<P>At the New Moone, and that her Hornes are thicke and dusky, that signifies a storme.</P>
<P>If at the eleventh day of the Moones age, she appears with a flamy colour, it then signifies stormes.</P>

<HEAD>Certiane other signes by which stormes at Sea are usually forefeene.</HEAD>
<P>WHen from the top of woods or forrests, a noise of wind is heard, and that those who are out of the wood feele no wind, it signifies infallibly, a great ensuing storme.</P>
<P>When the sea being calme, is heard to murmure with∣in it selfe, it signifies that great winds are towards.</P>
<P>When the Dolphins shew themselves, and play above the waves, it is the sign of an ensuing storm, which you must expect from that part whence the Dolphin first appeared.</P>
<P>When the Sea Meews flye landward, and abandon the Sea, it is the signe of a storme.</P>
<P>When the Rain-Bow appeares in the South, it signifies great showers: Appearing towards the West, its only a signe of Dew or Mists.</P>
<P>But being seen in the East, it is a signe of fair and cleare weather.</P>

<HEAD>What the wind is, its qualities, and how its ingendred.</HEAD>
<P>THe wind is an evaporation of the Earth, which as∣scends above the Aire, whose vapour is hot and dry, and the which pierces the Aire by its subtilty, for as the wind in its species is of a subtle vapour, and that the Na∣ture of subtle things is to ascend, therefore its ascents are made by the subtle vapours of the Earth, from whence it is driven back again about the Earth, by the coldnesse of the middlemost Regions ayre.</P>
<P>So that the off-Spring and motion of the wind, pro∣ceeds from above, and its matter from beneath.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>
<P> At the beginning the winds have no great force, but the farther they blow, the more they increase in strength, because of the new exhalations which are mingled with them: As it happens in Floods, which though but little in their births, yet do augment and continually increase by the reception of new additionall waters.</P>
<P>When two contrary winds meet, the weakest always yeelds unto the strongest, and this makes a whirle-wind, which causes the losse of Ships, when they chance to be under the power of such a Whirle-wind.</P>
<P>The exhalations of which the winds are made, do not on the suddaine yeeld to the Clouds which they meete with in the Aire; but strive to overcome them, and so to force their passage for their ascent: and so it happens that ere they blow here beneath; we see the Clouds above move, by the agitation of the winds.</P>
<P>And because the winds are composed of different mat∣ters, and qualities, to those which forme the Raine, they cannot last long together, but alwayes struggle and strive untill they have overcome each other. And Raine most commonly gets the better, unlesse the wind be provided with a great quantity of matter and substance.</P>
<P>Nor can the winds maintaine it selfe against the vehe∣mency of extreame heats, nor against the rigour of ex∣treame cold: because the vehemency of heat disperses, and dissipates it, and the rigour of the cold congeales and closes it up with the Clouds, and afterwards reduceth it into Raine.</P>
<P>The Divine providence of God, in the creation and disposition of the winds, is worthy to be admired; not because the ambition of men have made thereof an In∣strument, and scourge to ruine themselves, by abusing thereof, as most men do, most imprudently, and vain∣ly:
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>As <HI>Xerxes</HI> King of <HI>Persia</HI> did; who though he passed the Seas to go to <HI>Greece;</HI> yet could he not vanquish it, though he had in a manner covered it with Souldiers.</P>
<P>So <HI>Alexander:</HI> who having passed the <HI>Indies,</HI> yet would have searcht for something more, even beyond the great Sea, and it greived him to heare that hee was at the worlds ends</P>
<P>But as for the incomprehensible bounty of God, who hath disposed of the windes into so many parts, for the preservation of the Earth, and Aire in a sweet tempe∣rance, for the bringing in of Raines, and afterwards the driving of them back, both for the nourishing of Fruits, Seeds, and all fruit Trees, which by the agitation of the winds, and other causes, are ripened, giving likewise nou∣rishment to the Corne, which it ripens, and preserves from drying and withering. Usefull likewise to Man, towards the discovery of Forraigne parts, and remote Countryes, unto which unlesse a man should travell, he should be farre more ignorant then many bruite beasts, wanting the experience of divers things, which conduce towards the bettering of his understanding, &amp;c.</P>
