<P>SInce my last, of the 2. of this instant, here hath hapned a great alteration in this kingdom, and those who seemed powerful and potent, are now moultted away, and come to nothing; for upon Lieu. Gen. <HI>Lesleys</HI> advancing towards them with 3000. horse and foot, divers of the adverse party desisted from any further military prosecution, and deserted the engage∣ment for <HI>Charles</HI> the second; others resolved to persist therein, and to give Battell, preparing themselves to receive the Parliaments Forces: But upon the Lieut. Generals neer approach, he sent a summons to Col.
<PB N="2" REF="3"/><HI>Frizle</HI> (the commander in chief) to come in, and desist from any further acts of hostility, and to know by what authority and commission, they entred into this engagement; who returned answer, <HI>That he acted no∣thing, but what he had commission for from his dread so∣veraign,</HI> Charles <HI>the second, and that if he made any op∣position, he would dispute it by the sword,</HI> and immediatly (during the time of treaty) sent forth a party of horse and foot, who fell upon some of the Lieutenant Gene∣rals out quarters, killed some, and took some priso∣ners: whereupon the parliaments forces being sore in∣raged, fell upon them with great violence, routed them took and scattered 1500 (upon articles) the chiefe of them are to be brought prisoners to this City, the mea∣ner sort to depart to their own homes, Col. <HI>Frizle</HI> e∣scaped, and fled to <HI>Endernesse</HI> with about 500 men, leaving about 120 dead in the field. The aforesaid Lieut. Gen. hath declared, that he will use his utmost endeavours for preiervation of the union between both kingdoms, and that he is resolved not to engage against the parliament of <HI>England</HI> and the army, which cau∣seth great tryumph and joy amongst the well affected party.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The distractions in these parts begin to increase daily, and the coles of Enmity and Discord are now kindling again; for the adverse party grow both nume∣rous and potent, and the Lancashire Souldiery excee∣ding insolent and stubborn, rejecting and disobeying the orders of his Excellency, and refusing to disband;
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>and instead of yeelding obedience thereunto, brake forth into passions of contempt, reviling against the parliament, and in a most rebellious manner, laying their hands upon the hilt of their swords, said; <HI>They would rather die, then disband, untill they had their full Arrears, and a good Government erected and set up with∣in this Nation.</HI> They are now fortifying themselves in several places of this County; at the time of their late Randezvouz they were not above 500 horse and foot, but since their Rebellious declaring against the parlia∣ment they are increased to a farre greater number, a∣bove 2000 more being added to them within these few days, who make in all about 3000 horse and foot, the Clergy (who have been the most instrumentall in our late troubles and distractions) sides with them, and preacheth much in their pulpits for the propagation and advancement of their Design, the spirits of Malig∣nity are ready to unite, and divers other come in daily to their assistance: if a speedy course be not taken to allay and quench the future issue of this present flame, in all probability it wil suddenly break forth, and shew its self in streams of bloud throughout this Northern Climate; for we are now in great fear of new and pre∣sent troubles, God avert them or sanctifie them to us, which is the earnest prayer of him, who remains</P>

<HEAD>A Message from Holland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Prince is here yet, but his departure expected, and by many longed for: I cannot certainly in∣forme you, whether it be into Scotland, or into Ire∣land, he is expected at both. Sir <HI>George Radcliffe</HI> is sent after Gen: <HI>Riven,</HI> to hasten the Swedish Army into their quarters: there are 6000 men at <HI>Necopia,</HI> ready to put to Sea, and 1200 at <HI>Lodusia,</HI> waiting only for the melting of the Ise: and the Duke of <HI>Helsigna</HI> their Generall.</P>
<P>There is at Hamborough, waiting only for a wind, great store of Souldiers: 6000 Danes are raising in Denmark, but upon what design is not as yet knowne, there is another great Army raising by the Zwitzers, wherein are many persons of great eminency, who command in chief, viz. seven Dukes, nine Marquesses, seventeen Earls, and two or three and twenty Lords. That of the Danes, two Dukes, seven Earles, three Marquesses, and fifteene or sixteen Lords. These are great numbers, and it is to be feared, will do more hurt to our already too poor Country, then they can do good. And yet we must have very many more, as well of the barbarous Irish, as of the beggarly Scot, and the both proud and foolish French.</P>
<P>We heare certainly, the peace is concluded on in France: and by an expresse from P. <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Prince of Wales is assured of a strong Hold in Ireland; for the two Princes <HI>Rupert</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> are at Sea with seventy two Ships, and Frigots, and their Randezvouz the twelfth of March, are to be within nine Leagues of Dublin, at the Castle of Burkley.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P> The sixth of this instant, the Lord of Or∣mond, Generall, the Lord of Clanrickard, Lieute∣nant Generall; the Lord <HI>Tasse,</HI> Generall of the Horse, the Lord Muskerry, Commissary; and Inchiquin; and Preston, with five thousand men, to meet <HI>Ormond</HI> and his fifteen thousand, at Pitmere, twenty miles from Dublin.</P>
<P>Ile assure you, this is the Princes intelligence: and if I could have got the Coppy of the Proclamation, sent to the Lord of Ormond, you should have had it; But take the heads. First, he shewes, that he hath no desire to commence his Reigne in bloud, and that he will freely pardon those now holding any Castle or Garrison for the Parliament of England; That he fights only to settle himselfe in the Throne of his late Father, and a deale to this purpose. This was sent to the Lord of Ormond, by Collonell <HI>Buckworth,</HI> to be proclaimed as a Pardon to all those that will falsify the trust reposed in them by the Parliament of Eng∣land.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 17. of this instant, here arrived a Frigate, who upon her casting anchor, immediately man∣ned a long Boat to the shore, the Mariners purporting that there hath been lately a great Fight at Sea between Captain <HI>Moulton</HI> and prince <HI>Rupert</HI> neer the Western point, and that after a bloudy fight, it pleased God to crown the said capt. <HI>Moulton</HI> with Victory, and to sink two of the enemies ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Leopard</HI> (formerly
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>called by the name of the <HI>Kings Royall Swallow</HI>) car∣rying 40 pieees of Ordnance, and the <HI>Patrick</HI> of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> carrying 24 This fight continued for the space of two hours, being with great gallantry disputed by both parties; and after the exchange of several dread∣full Vollies, the enemy perceiving two of their ships bequeathing themselves to the mercilesse waves, held off, and with a fair gaile lanched forth into the Ocean: it is said the losse is very great on both sides, many be∣ing slain and wounded, yet the Mariners in the said Fri∣gate make mention, that the losse of the enemy doth far exceed ours, by reason of above 80 being drowned at the sinking of the aforesaid ships. Captain <HI>Moultons</HI> Squadron consisted of about twelve ships, prince <HI>Ru∣perts</HI> four and twenty. Some of ours are exceedingly torn and battered, but since repaired and mrde whole: its further intimated, that in this fight there were be∣tween two and three hundred killed and wounded, the princes men begin to moulter away, and die apace, the bloudy fluxe, and other diseases being very briefe a∣mongst them <HI>(a just judgment to all perfidious Christi∣ans)</HI> if the parliaments Summers Fleet be but expedi∣ted to Sea, and timely assistance sent unto capt. <HI>Molton,</HI> no doubt, but he will be able to give a good accompt of this Summers Expedition. <HI>Oh! what a sad thing it is, that a handfull should perish at Sea, when thousands may be spared at Land.</HI></P>
