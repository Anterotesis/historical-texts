<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THat you may not be imposed upon by false <HI>Accounts,</HI> which I perceive some Ill Men do with a malicious Design industriously pro∣mote, concerning <HI>the present State of</HI> New-England; I have thought it my Duty to Communicate to you what Intelligence I have received from thence.</P>
<P>You may please to be Informed, that above a year ago, whilst Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> who acted by an Ille∣gal and Arbitrary Commission, under the late King <HI>James,</HI> was executing his Tyranny (as by their De∣claration published at <HI>Boston, April</HI> 18<SUP>th</SUP>. 1689. does more fully appear) over the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> in that part of the World began a War upon them.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Indians</HI> affirmed (how truly God knows) that they were encouraged so to do, not only by the <HI>French,</HI> who inhabit that Continent, but by Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> that so they might destroy King <HI>James</HI> his Enemies. A small party of <HI>Indians</HI> began the War, some of which were seized by the <HI>English;</HI> but Sir <HI>E.</HI> set them at liberty, with many favours, which did not a little augment the Jealousies of the People; and it is said these very <HI>Indians</HI> have done a great part of the Mischief since sustained by the Inhabitants there. Whilst these things were a do∣ing, Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> did all that possibly he could to keep People Ignorant of Affairs in <HI>England:</HI> Yea, some were imprisoned for dispersing the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI>'s Declaration, which was styled by some a <HI>Seditious Pamphlet,</HI> tending to <HI>Rebellion.</HI> This, notwithstanding the Prince his Declaration, (In∣telligence from <HI>England</HI> at the same time also ar∣riving, that in <HI>Hull, Dover,</HI> &amp;c. the Illegal Go∣vernours were seized on) did so Inspire and Ani∣mate great multitudes of People, as that they se∣cured Sir <HI>E.</HI> and his Arbitrary Complices, who had been their Oppressors, reserving them for such Punishment as <HI>the King and Parliament of</HI> Eng∣land should think meet for them: And this they did that all the World might see they acknow∣ledge a dependance on <HI>England,</HI> as by their Char∣ters they are obliged.</P>
<P>They supposed those Persons to be great Crimi∣nals, who had either prosecuted <HI>Quo Warranto's</HI> against their <HI>Charters,</HI> or pretended Surrenders when there were none, or had levied Moneys on the Kings Subjects, without any consent of the People, or of their Representatives; and this too in those Colonies, against whose Charters no Judg∣ment was entred, or legal Surrenders made, but an Arbitraty Power set over them.</P>
<P>On the first notice of his present Majesty (then Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>) his Declaration, before ever they know what the Event of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld be, they readily Embarqued themselves in that Glorious Cause which is for <HI>Religion, Liberty, and Property.</HI></P>
<P>And immediately upon their hearing that the Prince was King of <HI>England,</HI> they did with the greatest Alacrity Proclaim him their King in <HI>New-England:</HI> And this they did of their own accord, without any Order from hence requiring it of them.</P>
<P>After this (as Letters from thence inform) the <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> had been so favourable, burnt several (some of them considerable) Plantati∣ons in the Eastern parts of the Countrey, killing or taking Captive some scores of them; of which as yet we have not a full and particular Account: Al∣so the Fort of <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> being deserted, was sometime in the hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> but the Ma∣ster of the last Ship that came from <HI>Boston,</HI> relates, That now there are neither <HI>Indians,</HI> nor <HI>French,</HI> nor any other in that Fort, it being demolished by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateer, who was lately on that Coast, and has taken away the Guns which were in it.</P>
<P>'Tis also credibly reported, That the <HI>New-Eng∣landers</HI> had a Fight with the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>September</HI> last: And that their Enemies were Routed, not one <HI>Indian</HI>-Enemy to be seen or heard of for six weeks before the last Vessels came from thence.</P>
<P>In a Letter from <HI>Boston, October</HI> 16. 1689. writ∣ten by a good hand, are these words, <Q REND="margQuotes">The <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> do now and then some hurt in our Plantations, but of late little, for there is an Army of <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> with two or three hundred of our Friend-<HI>In∣dians</HI> gone out against them, and have beaten them. Also there is an Army of other <HI>Indians</HI> call∣ed <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which are going out against them, so that in a short time an end may be put to this trouble.</Q></P>
<P>Another Letter written by a Person worthy of
<PB N="2" REF="2"/> Credit, (dated <HI>October</HI> 21.) giveth a further (and indeed a very remarkable) Account of the present State of Affairs there, which I have therefore cau∣sed to be transcribed; the words are these.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P><HI>Sir,</HI> Among our other Calamities at this day afflicting of us, we are extreamly intangled by an <HI>Indian</HI> War, which hath ruined some Heathe∣nish <HI>English</HI> Plantations in the Northern and Ea∣stern Parts of the Countrey; but we have an Ar∣my now in the pursuit after those Enemies, who affirm (as our Captives escaped from them inform) that they are encouraged by some Gentlemen in <HI>Bo∣ston,</HI> vigorously to prosecute the War upon us. By a marvellous Providence the most Mighty and Warlike Nation of the <HI>Indians,</HI> namely, the <HI>Mo∣hawks,</HI> who dwell three or four hundred miles to the Westward, are become implacable Enemies to the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> under whose Patronage and Encouragement our <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies do shroud themselves. These <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which are the Ter∣ror of all about them, have kindly offered to give a Destructive Visit unto our Enemies, when their hand's in at the slaying of the <HI>French,</HI> whom they have already slaughtered many hundreds of, and we are every day waiting for the Is∣sue of it.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, That these <HI>Mohawks</HI> had been many of them perverted unto <HI>Popery</HI> by the endea∣vours of the <HI>French Jesuits</HI> amongst them; but some while since a noted Jesuit pretended to work a <HI>Mira∣cle</HI> for their Confirmation in the <HI>Roman Catholick Re∣ligion;</HI> and told them, That God was angry at them for their making no more Demonstrations of their Zeal for his Religion: and therefore as a token of it, such a day the Sun would be black. Before the day came, the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> many o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opportunity for some Conversation with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and acquainting them with their Expectations of this Miracle, the <HI>Dutch</HI> told them, Every Child amongst them could foretell as much as that came to; for an <HI>Eclipse of the Sun</HI> was to happen on that day: But (said they) let the Jesuit make the Sun black a day before, or a day after, and then believe all he says.</P>
<P>Hereupon they were so terribly distasted at the Jesuits going to put a trick upon them, that they have resolved to Renounce what little Po∣pery they had, and have seriously applyed them∣selves to some Protestant Ministers, whose Instru∣ctions they seem to imbibe with affections that invite us to consider upon some further Expedi∣ents for their Conversion.</P></Q>
<P>Thus that Letter.</P>
<P>There are also several Letters, dated <HI>October</HI> last, directed to some Persons of Quality in <HI>London,</HI> from the the Honourable <HI>Simon Bradstreet,</HI> who is the present Governour at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> which inform of the great Devastations made by the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> (that having been the chief Seat of the War) and in <HI>Hampshire;</HI> and some mischief they have done (tho not much) in the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Colony: But the three Colonies of <HI>Massachusetts, Plimouth,</HI> and <HI>Connecticot,</HI> (which were whilst they enjoyed their Charter-Govern∣ment called the <HI>Ʋnited Colonies</HI>) have by a joynt concurrence sent out a considerable Force against the Common Enemy in two Bodies; they could not come to a pitcht Battel with the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose manner is to skulk in the Woods, and to do their mischief by several Parties. The same Honoura∣ble Person (together with the Council in <HI>Boston</HI>) writes, that they are not secure from an Attack by the <HI>French,</HI> who (as they hear) have considerable strength in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> but by the help of God, they will endeavour to preserve and defend their Majesties Interest, as well against the <HI>French,</HI> as any other Enemies to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Also, That some in <HI>Albany</HI> fearing an Attack from the <HI>French,</HI> having first made their Applicati∣on to <HI>New-York,</HI> could not be supplyed from thence, they sent to the present Government at <HI>Boston</HI> for Assistance; and Order has been taken by the Con∣currence of the three Colonies for the raising of a Company to be sent to <HI>Albany,</HI> to enforce and strengthen the Garrison there: For the several Go∣vernments of the Colonies in <HI>New-England,</HI> hold themselves concerned to intend the security and pre∣servation of their Majesties Interest throughout that whole Countrey. And divers particular Persons (such is their Loyalty and Affection to their present Majesties, King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI>) have been willing to advance of their own Estates, to∣wards the charge thereof, upon the publick Credit, some beyond their Abili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> They moreover write, That some Persons who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te unhappy Government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der Sir <HI>E▪ A.</HI> seei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em∣selves disappoitned in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hopes of raising their Fortunes upon the ruines of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> People of <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> manifest their disaffection, not only to the pre∣sent Government there, but in <HI>England</HI> also, some of them having been so impudent as to express their Expectations and Desires, that the late King <HI>James</HI> would be restored again; and have done what they could to Royle the Inhabitants, by raising and fo∣menting false Reports concerning the present State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Affairs in <HI>England:</HI> But the People (as well as those who are now in Government there) are sted∣fast in their Loyalty to their Present Majesties.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is what is come to my hands respecting the present State of <HI>New-England.</HI> I expect more daily, which when I receive, I shall not fail to gra∣tifie your desires in imparting what may be relyed on as a true Relation: This is all at present, from</P>
