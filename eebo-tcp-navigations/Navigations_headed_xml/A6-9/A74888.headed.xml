<HEAD>A Narrative from Major Dorril, of the proceedings at sea, from the <HI>13</HI> of May to this present.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 31 of May, comming out of the Sound, off the Naes, we discovered about 10 in the morning a fleet of some 60 or 70 great ships, with 5 great convoyers, they were two English miles to the weather of us, and stood South-east for the Sound; we stood along the Land North∣west. <HI>May</HI> 15. The wind blew very hard, we stood in to the sea 6 or 8 Glasses, standing again to the shore south, we discovered a great sail to our windward, about 4 in the afternoon, we aimed to be between him and the shore, but looking out we discovered above 100 of great ships, with many convoyers, who having a Galiot with him sent him off from the fleet to discover us, we had a <HI>Danish</HI> Fane up, which when he discovered he came no further. This is conceived to be the Russia fleet. <HI>May</HI> 16. We espyed the Berghen fleet, and immediatly thereupon a great ship in our water athwart our bow, and there was in his compa∣ny above 300 great ships, which we afterwards discover∣ed, all standing south, we could not miss them, therefore durst not trust to our running, but rather by plain dealing or impudence, either to outface them, or to deceive them, and so we stood through their whole fleet, keeping all our men close but five, whereof 4 were Danes; the first ship that came up to speak us, was a ship with 20 Guns, he hung out his Dutch colours, we our Danish, he askt us whence we were, we told him from <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> and bound for Berghen in Norway; we askt them from whence
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>their fleet, they answered, from Amsterdam, Rotter∣dam, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Out of Scotland it is certified, that the <HI>Advice, Fox,</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth</HI> frigats, met with two of the Dutch Merchant∣men not far from <HI>Shetland,</HI> laden with <HI>French</HI> wines; who for some time disputed the seas, but after a very sharp conflict, they were both boarded, and brought into Aber∣deen.</P>
<P>From aboard the Resolution off the Texel, 27 May, came thus: A councell being called by the Generals on board this ship, it was this day resolved by the Officers, That the whole English fleet do from hence set sail for the English coasts; that the place of Randezvouz be where they shall come to anchor off of Yarmouth, on the backside of the Sands; and it was resolved also that Or∣ders should be sent into the River, and other parts, which accordingly are sent for the rest of the ships that are ready to sayl, to come and joyn with the fleet there, where it is resolved to stay 48 hours. We are now within sight of the steeple, and do ride at Anchor five langues from the shore.</P>
<P>Van Trump we hear is at Gorce with 120 men of War, and fifty more are expected to joyn with him, which will not probably bee prevented. Gen. Blake is joyned with Monk and Dean, and now are bound Southward; and ha∣ving sent forth a Van squadron, soon possessed them∣selves of 10 Danish and Dutch ships, laden with Pitch, Tar, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the enemy hath taken from Us two brave colliers, and look with a notable sheeps eye upon our Malego men, coming for <HI>London.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last dated the 26 instant, I gave your Honour an account of ten sale of ships in this Road, since which more men are put on board them, and I hope there will be joyned one or more to their number very suddenly, these being in a good capa∣city for sudden service, as soon as the wa∣ter and some other necessaries are come down to them, which is expected every hour, and assurance given of it. Yesterday the Hampshire Frigot came into this road, the Essex Frigot is in Tilbury Hope, which will be ready to joyn with the other; Ge∣neral Blake is in Tilbury hope aboard the Essex frigot.</P>
<P>This squadron is to fall down six or se∣ven miles to morrow morning early to the
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>North, to be in readiness to answer any sudden command.</P>
<P>Major Bourn sent out the Nichodemus on Thursday last, and other vessels at o∣ther times to gain intelligence of our fleet, as also of the Enemies motion. The Ni∣chodemus is returned this day, and gives account that the Dutch lye at North-sand head, Long sand head, and as low North as Orfordness. There will remain five or sixe Merchants ships in the service of the State that are betwixt this and Eriff, which with care may be speedily made ready to sail with those here. A Guard is appointed to ply to the North-foreland, for the secu∣rity of the Fishery.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUr fleet under the command of the two Generals, put forth from Yarmouth Road the 31 of May, to seek for the Hollanders; and upon the second instant, a∣bout four in the morning, they discovered a great fleet of ships near St. Georges Channel; upon this discovery the Generals supposing them to be the Dutch fleet, immedi∣ately called a Councel of War, where it was resolved that they should advance towards them, and give them battel: They likewise having a view of our Fleet, as far as they could perceive, made preparation to oppose us, which was a great rejoicing to our fleet, whose onely aim was to in∣gage them, so referring themselves to the protection of the Almighty, they bore up to them: About 7 in the mor∣ning they began to ingage, and the fight was fierce and ter∣rible for us to hear; whereupon the Governour sent forth a pinnace to observe the issue of the fight, which about 9 in the evening returned, and gave us an account, that with great hazard, and not without some small losse, our ships had took 4 of the enemies, sunk 5, and burnt 3, upon re∣ceipt of this we in this Town not onely gave thanks to the Lord for this, but required a future blessing upon the indeavours of his poor servants. Having ended our Ori∣sons we began to make preparation both for offending the enemy, and defending our selves, and mustred all the force we could make, planting our great guns in convenient places, and providing ammunition for our selves, and for the ships if occasion should serve. The Ordnance plaied til after day light, and this morning very early they began a∣gain. I can give you no further account for the present, but till the next opportunity, must desire to remain,</P>
