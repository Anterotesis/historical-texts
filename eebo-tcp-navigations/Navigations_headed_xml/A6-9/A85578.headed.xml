<HEAD>TO HIS EXCELLENCIE The Lord General CROMVVEL;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur just dealing with your Adversaries, is matter of real Honour to your Person, your Enemies themselves being Judges; your instructing the ignorant, your rebuking the obstinate; your remitting the Penitent; your remitting the Innocent; your keeping Co∣venant and condition of Articles with all men, have mani∣fested your proceedings both of War and Peace, to be truly Honourable to them, but especially to Us, who have heard how <HI>Judah</HI>-like <HI>you have ruled with God, and have bin faithfull with the Saints,</HI> Hos. 11. last. Your silence before
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>the Lord, when a Cloud was upon the Camp) had great confidence, when the Lord went before you like a Pillar of Fire by night, shining upon your wayes, and telling you, that you should be to your Enemies, as threshing Instru∣ments with teeth; And this your confidence in God, what boldness wrought it before the Battle? and what humble∣ness of mind after the Victory? refusing honour of men, when God had put glory upon you, in sight of all the world. It may be said, <HI>Before honour goeth humility.</HI> Prov. 15.22. That may be an humbleness, as of necessity; but that humbleness which followeth honour, is ever matter of lasting praise; for, <HI>Honour upholdeth the humble in spirit,</HI> and victory over a mans self is the greatest conquest: <HI>For∣tior est qui se, quam qui fortissima vincit Maena.</HI> Yea, this your confidence uttered did put life into your Counsels, courage into your Resolutions, and made your Forces more forcible and active, so as they did the work of the Lord effective, both at <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> For there fell down many slain, because the War was of God, 1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 5.22. God is the Iudge himself to whom both Parties at <HI>Dunbar</HI> made their appeales, God has pleaded the Cause of his People, and since these appeales hath given sentence for you now twice. The issue must no longer pass under the vain titles of meer events and chances of War. It hath been the wonder of all Lands to hear of <HI>England,</HI> how the meek of the earth here, have formerly born all manner of yoaks and oppressions under Royal and Episcopal Rulers, and how they have lately risen like Gyants and men of might, for recovering their Liberties, to defend their just Rights and to bring wrong-doers to condigne punishment. As if the judgment (against <HI>Moab</HI>) written, had been seal∣ed upon their hearts, <Q>Cursed is he that doth the Work
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>of the Lord negligently, and cursed is he that with∣holdeth his sword from bloud,</Q> <HI>Ier,</HI> 48.10. Neither regard∣ing Nature nor Nations, that they might execute God had said, <HI>Distress not Moab,</HI> Deut. 2.9. till <HI>Moab</HI> had thus sinned. But after <HI>Moab</HI> had committed Idolatry (a sin a∣gainst the Nation of <HI>Israel</HI>) he shall bear his curse, that spares <HI>Moab:</HI> any former command of God to the contra∣ry notwithstanding. Sinfull mens changes justifie God and good men, in these changes of Times. Now <HI>England</HI> is delivered from her Enemies, and the people dwell safely through the mercy of God under your hand, We humbly desire this, that after all publike expeditions against open enemies, you may (now) keep your selves from foes of your own Houshold, from friends of your own Councel; for Christ himself was betrayed with a kiss, wounded in the house of his friend: Gallant <HI>Iudas</HI> was treacherously flain by <HI>Demetrius:</HI> And good <HI>Ionathan</HI> captivated by <HI>Triphon</HI> pretending kindness to him. <Q LANG="lat">Cura teipsum, cautus esto, ne fidas.</Q> Set the Lord God alwayes before you, wait for his counsel; let impartial justice be your greatest de∣sign and be not perverted by envy or flattery of men; So run that you may obtain, in due time you shall reap, if you faint not. Couragiously follow the Captain of your Sal∣vation, patiently carry the cross after him, and let us pray for the peace of the Commonwealth of <HI>England,</HI></P>
<P><HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the valiant Commanders, and watchful Souldiers.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was an old question of one <HI>Hetruscus, Whether a Chri∣stian may in any case go to war?</HI> Its answered, he may; for <HI>to do justice and judgment, is more acceptable then sacrifice,</HI> Prov. 24.3. And its answered by <Q><BIBL>Osorius de Nobilit. Chri∣stian. lib. 3.</BIBL>Respublica non poss it stabiliri, nisi armorum presidio, qui millitem tollit, Rempublicam funditus evertit: Christus politeias non eripuit, sed in melius instruit.</Q> The Common∣wealth cannot be stablished, unless it be guarded with arms. Take away the Souldier, and ye overturn the Common∣wealth. Christ would not abolish Civil Governments, but form them for the better: he neither took <HI>the Axe</HI> from the Judges; nor did <HI>Paul</HI> deny the <HI>Sword</HI> to the Magi∣strates; nor did <HI>John Baptist</HI> disarm the Souldiers, but pre∣scribed them Lawes of Innocency and moderation, <HI>Do vio∣lence to no man, and be content with your wages,</HI> Luk. 3.13. yea, <HI>Paul</HI> calls the Magistrate a Minister of God to thee for good, thou doing well; and saith, he bears the Sword to execute wrath upon them that do evil. Indeed, it were to be wished by every Christian, that all men may contain them∣selves from doing evil, that there were not this occasion gi∣ven for punishment, and for war; The boldness of Vice must be reproved by the couragiousness of Vertue. Our Fathers of old were led by the Spirit for the rebuking Malefact∣ors; and we know that vengeance in a private matter be∣comes valour in the case of a Commonwealth. Patience in personal injuries, does in National wrongs assume a magna∣nimity invincible, as <HI>Joshua</HI> did; and it was a fruit of their peace with God, when our Fathers undertook <HI>Sanctissima
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>Bella contra sceleratos,</HI> most holy wars against notorious offenders; for what peace? so long as <HI>Jezabels whoredomes, and her witchcrafts are so many?</HI> The end of War upon the wicked, should be the quietness and peace of those that are godly and honest. Humbly acquaint your selves with God, and be at peace among your selves. Couragiously follow the Captain of your Salvation, patiently carry his Cross after him, faithfully commit the safe keeping of your souls in well-doing to him, and let us pray also for the peace of Englands Common-wealth, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the free People of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Countrey-men,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe best way to settle the Common-wealth in a firm and lasting peace, is to look back to Rules of Equity and Iustice, to principles of Nature, and Right-Reason, to Gods Law, and good Conscience; and every one of you must contribute your utmost hereunto: That power lyeth in you; and there is now recovered your right to use i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Your Liberties have been redeemed to you at a dear rate, and with great expence of bloud and Treasure; maintain it then as free-men, and use your Liberty, not against your selves, but for your selves; Cease mourning for <HI>Saul,</HI> the King and his Traines, the Body is not destroyed by remo∣ving bad humours: Let your hearts be towards the pre∣sent Governours of <HI>England,</HI> who have willingly offered themselves among the people, and to their servants, who have jeoparded their lives for your sakes; I mean, to the
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>Officers and their Army, who have not designed you for their own worldly advantage, but have scoped at your wel∣fare, who by no sensible feares have suffered themselves to be perverted from impartial justice, but have bound up your safety and theirs in one.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> last came Intelligence, of a great fight be∣tween the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Holland;</HI> and that after a sharp Dispute, the <HI>English</HI> became Vict∣ors, and pursued the Enemy to their Ports and Harbours. In which Conflict they took seven stately ships, five hun∣dred prisoners, burnt two, and sunk five; but not without some loss: Into the truth whereof, I shall make some fur∣ther enquiry; &amp; refer you to the <HI>Moderate Occurrences</HI> for just and ample satisfaction therein.</P>
