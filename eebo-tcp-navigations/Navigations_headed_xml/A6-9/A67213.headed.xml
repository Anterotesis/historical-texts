<HEAD>The humble Petition of RICHARD WYLDE Merchant.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat whereas the Trade of the</HI> East-Indies <HI>was begum now 54. yeares past, and hath been continued ever since by a Company, and managed by Merchants, and other Citizens of</HI> London, <HI>for some yeares by Voyages, which discovering every day new Trades, pro∣ving profitable, both to the Adventurers, and Nation in generall, gave encouragement to all degrees of People, to subscribe a large Joynt Stock of above 1500 thousand pounds, which for some yeares prospered, untill after dis∣covery and setting a factory in</HI> Surrat, <HI>the trade of Silk of</HI> Persia <HI>came known to us, and proved of very great con∣sequence, as to the expence of much broad cloath and other Manufactures of</HI> England, <HI>as also of many other of</HI> In∣dia, <HI>(whereof the</HI> Portingalls, <HI>had then the whole trade to</HI>
<PB REF="4"/> <HI>themselves) which our</HI> Turkey Merchants <HI>envying more especially this of the silke of</HI> Persia, <HI>as fearing, that if the trade of</HI> India <HI>did thrive, and grow rich, it would bring all, or the greater part of the Silk of</HI> Persia, <HI>by way of</HI> India, <HI>became therefore adventurers in the same stock: And the better to strengthen their party, and get the ma∣naging of the whole action unto themselves by electing Al∣dermen, and other rich</HI> Merchants <HI>Governours, Deputies, and commitees of their own society, they carried all things to their own minds, even to the raining of four joynt stocks and as many, or more voyages by their wilfull neglects, im∣provident courses, and ill managed actions, As your High∣ness will perceive by the following Remonstrance, wherein I have not only represented the said Companies errors, but also shewed your Highness how those might have bin, &amp; yet may be (if rightly manged made most rich, and profitable trades to this Nation, adding thereunto some of the most notorious wrongs, and injuries, the Dutch have perpetra∣ted upon the persons, ships and goods of our people in</HI> India, <HI>to the losse of some Millions of pounds for many yeares past, and for ever hereafter, if your Highnesse does not take the same into most serious consieration, and make it a State Action, the best way of recovering from the Dutch, all, or at least one third part of the</HI> Mollucca <HI>Islands, as our Just due, or at least the third part of the Spices there∣on, according to the Contract made in 1619. with satisfa∣ction for their long detention of the said Spices from our Company; which Composition, if strongly prest, (as it de∣serves) may be such as may give reasonable satisfaction to the Company, and a large proportion of Stock to prosecute all those rich Trades of</HI> India, Persia, Arabia, Mollucca Islands, Manillios, China, and Japon, <HI>to the great in∣crease of Treasure to your Highnesse's Eachequer, and Stock of the Nation, or by laying it open and free for every sub∣ject
<PB REF="4"/> of</HI> England, &amp;c. <HI>that hath a minde to trade into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parts, being regulated by Agents and Consulls, as your Highnesse shall please to appoint in every principall Port, as are the</HI> Turkie <HI>and</HI> Muscovia <HI>Merchauts, that so eve∣ry man may be Master of his own Goods, both abroad and at home, and dispose of them at his owne pleasure; and not to be tyed to joynt Stocks, as hitherto, which as they are the worst of Monopolies, so are they little better than Cheats to the Adventurers and Nation, whereof this is the greatest as will appeare by the following Discourse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Pet therefore doth (in the behalf of the whole Nation) most humbly intreat your Highnesse to take the same into your grave &amp; wise Consideration, That if upon due exami∣nation, the Trade be found profitable to the Nation, by ma∣king it a State Action, or laying it open and free for one seven yeares experience, it may be supported in a full and plentifull way of trade; if otherwise it prove not such, it may be suppressed and quite given over.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the trade of <HI>India,</HI> in former times, when we had Wars with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> did re∣quire a greater number of Shipping, then now that we have peace with them; so did those many, and great Shipping, re∣quire a farre larger stock to maintaine their great charge and expence; who of necessity were forced to spend two, if not three years in that Countrey, which could not well be done, but by sufficient Stock, to be sent out upon them for trade between Port and Port, in <HI>India</HI> it selfe: whereunto the Court of Committees of our <HI>East India</HI> Company, would never be perswaded, nor yet to follow the same in so full and ample manner, as might be able to beare so great a charge; Notwith∣standing the many and earnest advices and solicitations of their Servants, and Factors, both from <HI>Surrat, Bantam, Persia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factors s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lici∣tations for in∣crease of Stock, for Trade from Port to Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elished.</NOTE> <HI>Muslapatan,</HI> and <HI>Macassar,</HI> from whence all the best commo∣dities for Trade were to be provided, and which did yeild at least 2. 3. some 4. for one, within the compasse of one Mon∣soon or sixe Months time, as by their owne Accompts, and Letters, (if duly examined) will plainly appear.</P>
<P>Now for as much as I have not the accompts of what passed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abstract of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x years disbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se∣men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dia,</HI> what St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck sent out, and what promised for the future.</NOTE> in <HI>Surrat</HI> before, and since my being there, nor yet have seen those at <HI>Bantam;</HI> I cannot, nor will not, deliver any thing as from my owne experience, but shall referre them to their own Accompts and Letters from those parts, which will sufficiently
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> Prove, what I have asserted. Yet for the sixe yeares, and an half, I was in <HI>Surrat,</HI> I shall deliver a true abstract of Stock yearly sent thither, every yeares charges and expences, toge∣ther with every years returnes from <HI>Surrat,</HI> whereby your Highnesse will plainly see, what wilfull and improvident courses, those grave and wise men, that governed at the Helme of that action, did steer, to the great losse and hinderance of the Ge∣nerall Adventurers, (though to their owne private ends, e∣nough advantageous)in the interim, not letting to make great shewes of reall intentions to follow that Trade, in a more full and ample manner than formerly; as by an Order and Com∣mand by their Letters, of the 16. of <HI>March,</HI> 1624. to provide Goods in <HI>Surrat,</HI> to the value of 141447 l. 10 s. 00 <HI>d.</HI> for yearely returnes for <HI>England</HI> onely; which with charges there, would have cost at least 160000 l. starling, the partiulars whereof, I forbear to insert here, to avoide your Highnesse trouble, as not materiall unto the worke in hand.</P>
<P>To performe all which, they sent out the same yeare, but 36000l. in Goods and Monies, earnestly requiring by their said Letters, that all the said goods, might be provided every yeare for Annuall returnes for <HI>England,</HI> and which was performed most yeares at high Interest, of 13. and 14. <HI>per cent.</HI> whereof they had notice every yeare, both by Letters and Accompts, yet did they not send out sufficient Stock, to pay that great de∣vouring debt, but let it continue 11. or 12. yeares unpaid, to the great hinderance of the Generall Adventurers, ignorant of their wilfull intentions, as to the ruine of that second, and great joynt Stock, by their ill-managing thereof; which, that it may most clearly appear to your Highnesse, I will give you the abstract of all disbursements in <HI>India,</HI> what the Company sent out every yeare, as also what returnes they had thence, for the sixe yeares I was in <HI>India.</HI></P>

<P>Whereas, had they sent out 200000 l. every yeare in quick stock, as they have been often advised, and earnestly intreated by their Factors in <HI>India,</HI> that great interest had been saved, and the charge had increased nothing more than in Customes, and Charge Merchandise; but the profit, both abroad and at home would have been such, as would have born all losses, which have happened and befalne that action, by the impro∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent sending home their Ships late in the yeare, and an over∣plus of faire gaine to have incouraged the generall Adventu∣rers in the pursuance of that brave and rich Trade, if rightly managed.</P>
<P>Being now falne upon the unhappy losses this trade hath su∣stained, it will not be out of season, to let you know how im∣providently they ordered the returne of their Ships from <HI>India</HI> late in the yeare, occasioned chiefly for want of stock in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry, to provide Goods in the best season, that so their Ships might come thence in <HI>December</HI> at farthest, so would they bring a Somer season all the way, and at home also; whereas coming thence in <HI>April,</HI> as for the most part they have done heretofore, they bring with them a Winter season, about the <HI>Cape of good Hope</HI> and all the way, &amp; upon our own Coast also, which hath occasioned the greatest losses by Sea, as wo∣full experience hath taught the generall Adventurers: And truly, if your Highnesse shall rightly observe, the constant course of the Dutch, in sending away their Ships about the be∣ginning of <HI>December,</HI> together with the long experience of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The late co∣ming of our ships ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>In∣dia</HI> cause o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so many losses.</NOTE> their Ships safe and seasonable arivall in <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Companies many losses, and hazardous adventures, they have run upon those Ships, which have come thence so late in the yeare; you cannot but conclude, those that managed that action, to have been, and still are, most wilfully improvident
<PB N="9" REF="9"/> in their way of trade, as if they did not desire its prosperity and welfare: And no lesse carelesse were they in the over∣charge of shipping, and unreasonable burthen of unnecessary servants at home; notwithstanding the many and often com∣plaints of the general Adventurers, even of late, when we had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Unnecessary charge of Ser∣vants, ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad and at home, a very great hin∣derance to our small stock.</NOTE> not in stock above a hundred four thousand pounds; our charge was as much here at home, and much more abroad, than when we had that great stock of 1600 thousand pounds, yet could they not prevaile with that Court to lessen this heavy burthen of unnecessary charge.</P>

<P>By reason of the great number of Ships, which we have there upon our exceeding great charge, as you well know, ten <NOTE PLACE="marg">The generall Adventurers disheartened for want of re∣turnes.</NOTE> great Ships, and two Pinnaces, if Captain <HI>Hall</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Fleet be safely there (as we hope they are) we have therefore thought good to furnish and send you but two ships for this voyage, namely, the <HI>Jonah</HI> of 800. tunnes, and the <HI>Expedition</HI> of 350. and howso∣ever, as we said before, the Adventurers are much dishearten∣ed for lack of returnes from you this yeare; yet have we, with much difficulty, prevailed with them for a conclusion of this se∣cond joynt Stock, and best advancement of the same, to send you a reasonable supply of Money and Goods, in these our two <NOTE PLACE="marg">Express com∣mand to send home all their Ships.</NOTE> Ships, whereby you may be the better provided, not only to lade home themselves, but all the rest of our Ships there also, for whom you have not sufficient stock there already, knowing that those you shall not lade home, will in one yeare eat out more than their own worth, in mens wages &amp; victuals only be∣sides the wearing out of themselves, their furniture, stores and provisions (as costly experience hath taught us) which duly recommended, you will acknowledge what damage we sustain, by keeping our ships there unreturned. wherefore we pray you, at any hand, to relade them all away with all expedition, that so we may have the whole returns of this our second joynt Stock from thence, upon its own adventure, without any lag or remaine (if possible) or as few as may be to be transported to our next joynt stock, for erection whereof we have resolved presently after dispatch of these two ships, to send forth a Book amongst the Adventurers for a new Subscription, which we

</LETTER>
<P>By the former clause of the said Companies Letters your Highness may plainly see how much they did blame the Pre∣sident <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blame for not sending home the <HI>Dolphin</HI> ac∣cording to promise.

<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<P>Here is a mystery beyond ordinary apprehension or com∣mon reason, not to be discerned but by those that have nar∣rowly searched into their unjust waies, which that your Highnesse may the better understand I shall humbly desire your Highnesse to look back unto the end of <HI>Anno</HI> 1628, and beginning of 1629, when they had a very great parcel of Indico come home upon the <HI>Palsgrave, Dolphin, Disco∣very,</HI> and <HI>William,</HI> of value above 200 thousand pounds; a parcel too big for any one, or a few to meddle with, yet must not be sold but in grosse and altogether; upon this great parcell (as I have been informed, and that most truly) did some particular Grandes, rich Committees, Aldermen, &amp;c. cast an eye of private interest, and the better to work their own ends, and discourage other men from medling there∣with, they did cunningly sell off some small parcels of Indico formerly bought at under-rates, by this means beating down the price and delaying to put the other to sale for almost a whole year, untill themselves were provided of monies and a season fitting their own dishonest intentions, which could not be untill they were assured the ships that went that year for <HI>India</HI> were gone clear from off our coast, having in their Letters by those ships given order unto their President and Councel in <HI>Surratt</HI> to buy no more Indico except at 8, or 9 Rupies the Maund; a price not known in our time, nor yet many years before; whih was as much as to say, Buy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Order sent in∣to <HI>India</HI> to buy no more In∣dico.</NOTE> none at all; which they durst not plainly say, lest the rest of the Court, not privie to their deceitful design should dis∣cover it.</P>
<P>The ships thus gone with this advise, which they believed <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Court of Sales called in a most surre∣pritious way contrary to their own or∣ders of Court.</NOTE> would have been observed in <HI>India,</HI> (as it might have been, if timely given) they forthwith caused a Bill of Sale for this great parcel of Indico to be set upon the Pillars in the <HI>Ex∣change</HI> at Eight daies warning (which if I be not misinfor∣med) ought by their own orders of Court, to have been at Eight weeks, that so men might have had time to joyn to∣gether, agree and provide monies, or security for so great and vast summes as that parcel would and did amount unto.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<P>This Day of Sales being come, few Buyers appeared, (but <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indico sold at under∣value, at rebate for months, 40 mo: which is 33 <HI>per cent.</HI> and 15 <HI>per cent.</HI> the impost of 6 d. <HI>per lib.</HI> is 48 <HI>per cent.</HI> gains, before it goe out of the land.</NOTE> those combined to out-bid all offers) that durst adventure upon so great a parcel as that was, especially seeing a great and rich Alderman make the first offer (though low) and back'd with divers other of his kindred, friends, and Co∣partners, whom they feared to displease; It was suddenly put to the Candle, (a fine Cheat, where a cunning Secretaty hath the art of Extinguishing) which was soon out; and the commodity his at a lower price than ever sold at before; And that at five, six months day of payment, upon rebate at 10 li. <HI>per cent.</HI> for five, eight months paying in ready money, as they did, rebating for 40 months, which is 33 1/3 <HI>per cent.</HI> which with 6 d. upon every pound of Indico for impost which they <NOTE PLACE="marg">A most noto∣rious abuse to the Adventu∣rers.</NOTE> received back after the rate of 10 groats a pound, which is 3 s. upon every 20 s. or 15 <HI>per cent.</HI> more, which together makes 48 3/1 <HI>per cent.</HI> a present and sure gain, before the commodity went out of the River, which if sold abroad, at the same price it cost here is a fair recompense for what they lost with the generality in the under rate they bought it at.</P>
<P>Adde hereunto the great weight and choice of the best of the Commodity given them by their own Servants: To pre∣serve <NOTE PLACE="marg">The dishone∣sty of their ser∣vants, in giving over weight to their Masters to preserve fa∣vour.</NOTE> their favour, some of whom also shared with them in their good bargains; which great wrong and injury to the generall Adventurers was beyond all honest and faithfull dealing, whereunto both Masters and Servants are, or ought to be every year by oath obliged; The like abuse is too fa∣miliary practised in the sale of all other Commodities, them∣selves <NOTE PLACE="marg">The same a∣buse in all o∣ther commo∣dities.</NOTE> being both Buyers and Sellers of the same, to the ex∣ceeding great prejudice of the Adventurers, who have in∣trusted them with the managing of their businesse in hopes of fair and just dealing.</P>
<P>But to come more neer to the mysterie it self, which is, why the general Adventurers, should so much applaud my good service done for them by saving them 100 thousand pounds in shipping by preserving at least 2000 land and sea∣mans lives, which must have perished with their ships if sunk in the sea, or fired in <HI>India,</HI> by gaining them above 600 thou∣sand pounds by the Goods, so sent, and brought home; all
<PB N="15" REF="12"/> which raised the Action to 11 1/3. <HI>per cent.</HI> as I said before. And for the very same cause, and no other, that Court of Committees should wish all those Ships sunk in the Sea, or fired in <HI>India,</HI> to the utter ruine of that Trade, which they have endeavoured, and now brought almost to their desired ends, as I shall more fully discover, when I come to discourse of the Trade for the silke of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>That which now troubled them was, first, the frustrating <NOTE PLACE="marg">The arrivall of 8. Ships in two years, with great store of Indico, lost their hoped for gaine.</NOTE> of their owne, expected gaines, which they had made to themselves, in hopes of at least two yeares time, for the sale of the said Indicoe, at their owne prises, having presently raised it to 50l. <HI>per cen.</HI> Profit, when unexpectedly, here arrived the same Summer sixe Ships, with a second great parcell of Indicoe which I had bought, and provided, before their said forbidding Letters came to my hands, and my selfe following <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which caused such Inhuma∣uiries fall from them, as to dis∣cover their evil intentions.</NOTE> the next year, with a third great parcell brought downe the piece againe, to almost what they had bought theirs at, which was the cause he and they lost of their hoped for gains, and moved such inhumanities to fall from them, faire and true expressions of their evil affection to those so rich Trades of <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A second was, a crossing their designe of buying all the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And crossing their base de∣signe of buying of Adventu∣res, a trick now againe in practice.</NOTE> Adventures of the Nobility, Gentry, Widdowes and Or∣phants, as they had bought of many, at halfe their value, as will plainly appeare by their owne accompts; proposing a∣mongst themselves, to ingrosse all Adventures, to the end, to make the whole Trade their own, and gaine that composi∣tion, expected from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> wholly to themselves, an intention, as foule, as false, to the betrayed trust of the Ad∣venturers.</P>
<P>And it will be no hard matter to prove that some of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Order for no mork Pepper to be sent home, as was formerly given for Indico, in prejudice of the Adventurers.</NOTE> present Grandees, and ruling Gommittees, who having late∣ly ingrossed all the Pepper of two yeares returnes, at base and low prizes, did so order the businesse in <HI>India,</HI> that no more Pepper should be sent home the following yeare, as formerly they did upon the like occasions, forbid any more <HI>Indico</HI> to be bought, not regarding the great losse the gene∣rall Adventurers did sustaine by keeping a great Ships
<PB N="16" REF="13"/> ladeing of Pepper in <HI>India,</HI> a whole yeare, which might have been sent home one year sooner; which Ship, and Pepper, was in great danger, to be surprized by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for want of timely advice given their Factors of the breach of Peace, as if in heart they desired the Ship and Pepper might be ta∣ken by them, or perish at Sea. But God Almighty frustra∣ted <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pepper Ships long de∣tention in <HI>Pli∣moth,</HI> not with∣out a mysterie if well exami∣nep.</NOTE> their desires, and brought in the Ship to <HI>Plymoth</HI> in safe∣ty, where she lay some Moneths, with faire windes, rather wilfully detained by their under-hand dealing, than for want of Convoy, which must be laid upon the Council of States failing in their promised supply; an old trick of that Court, to fling scandals upon the Supreame Power, in all their ge∣neral meetings, as they did heretofore, when ever the <HI>Dutch's</HI> Wrongs and Injuries were in question, the Supreame Powers must bear the blame, when themselves never made other than slight addresses unto them, as more willing they should not be composed, untill their owne designes were perfected.</P>
<P>Another heavy abuse to the generall Adventures, was theie neglect of Pressing the late King, and present Goun∣cil of State, for the lessening of the over-great Impost laid upon Indico, Pepper, and other <HI>India</HI> Commodities, which because in former times, when Indico was worth 5s. and 7s. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Impost of Indicoe, and Peper of so great profit to the Commit∣tees, that they doe not desire its easement as they ought.</NOTE> 6d. a pound, and Pepper, 3s. 4d. a pound, there was laid up∣on Indico 6d. and Peper 2d. a pound Impost, and now Indico being fallen one third part in price, and Pepper to 12d. a li. they are not able to beare it; the Generall Adventurers, at many meetings, have complained, as a neglect in the Gover∣nours, and Court of Committees, not ceally informing the Counnil of State of this over-charge; they have been made believe it is not their fault, having earnestly importuned the Council of State to lessen that great Impost on Pepper, &amp;c. but could never prevaile, when indeed they have been so far from pressing it, that they rather desire its continuance, as to them more beneficiall, in the buying of these commodities. As for Example,</P>
<P>Suppose there be in a Stock 100. thousand pounds (as there is little more in that now in being) and that a Committee man have 1000/. Stock, Adventure therein, which is one
<PB N="17" REF="13"/> hundred part of the whole, and there is two Millions of pounds of Pepper come home this year, which at 12d. the pound makes one hundred thousand pounds, which at 2 d. the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore why the Committee desire not to have the Im∣post of Pepper taken off, is their own pri∣vote gain thereby.</NOTE> pound impost is, 16666 l. 13 s. 4 d. upon the whole; the 100 part whereof, is, 166 l. 13 s. 4 d. which the said Committee∣man loseth in the whole parcell with the Generall Adventu∣rers; but this Committee-man buyeth this 100000 pounds worth of Pepper, and shipping it out again within 12 months, bath 2 d. for every pound of Pepper allowed him back for Impost, which is, 166666 l. 1 3 s. 4 d. so as here remains clear of gains, 16500 l. before the Commodity is gone out of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">16500 l.</NOTE> Land, without any advantage at all to the generall Adven∣turers, who may not wonder if the Court of Committees de∣sire not the taking off this great Impost, though sensilbe edough of their betrayed Trust, and breach of Oath, to manage all things in an upright way, and for the Generall good.</P>
<P>But were all those that have the managing of that Action here at home, bound, both by Oath and Bond, from being <NOTE PLACE="marg">If the Com∣mittee-men were bound from buying and selling the Companles Commodities, they would ne∣ver eover to be Committees.</NOTE> Buyers and Sellers of the Companies Commodities, neither directly for themselves, nor indirectly by other men for them, no Aldermen, nor great rich men, would trouble themselves to be Committee-men, as now they do; a course most injust and dishonest, to inrich themselves by the ruine of the Ad∣venturers, which hath ever been, and will be so, untill duly reformed by the States, taking the Action into their own protection, or laying it open and free for every man, that is willing to trade into the remote parts of <HI>India,</HI> and be Ma∣sters of their own Goods, both abroad and at home, to dis∣pose of them to their own best advantage; for Joynt Stocks do now too plainly appeare to be the worst of Monopolies, as this hath been the most hurtfull? that ever was to this Na∣tion.</P>
<P>Nor is your Highness and State a little abused by this man∣ner of returning of Impost upon all <HI>India</HI> Goods, that are transported within 12 Moneths, as accustomed, if not done by, and for the generall advdenturers account, to which end I suppose it was granted as a thing just and equall with all
<PB N="18" REF="14"/> other Merchants; but with this Company, the greater part (if not all) of the Commodities brought out of of <HI>India,</HI> are bought, and Ship out again by particular Committee-men, that, peradventure, have not above 3. or 400. l. adventure <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 o 400 l.</NOTE> in the whole Stock; What reason is there, that that man that hath but 300. l. adventure (perhaps none at all, but as a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Perhaps none at all, but as a Freeman.</NOTE> Free-man) shall buy for 10, 20, 30, 4000 l. or more, in any Commodity, and receive back the Impost of the whole, with∣out any benefit at all to the generall Stock, which first paid it, but so much reall loss to the State; for, suppose a Com∣mittee-man of 300 l. adventure, buyeth a parcell of Pepper worth 10000 l. which he shippeth out within 12. months (according to the former evill Custom) whereby he hath 2 d. in the pound Impost returned, which comes to 1666 l. 13 s. 4 d. whereas his due is but 33 l. 65. 8. the Impost of 300. pounds worth of Pepper, whereby this Committee-man gains in one year, almost five times his whole adventure, and so proportionably, if he buy for 20. 30. 50. or 100. thousand pounds worth of Pepper, as some men have often bought, to the great inriching of themselves, without any advantage at all to the Company in generall, and great loss to the State for these many years past, which may be, for the future, re∣medied. This being one prime reason, that so many Alder∣men, and great rich men, become Committe-men, and are Buyers and Sellers of their own Commodities, at their own prices, and long time, with rebate for 8. moneths for every 6. moneths a notorious abuse to the generall Adventurers, as I have said else-where, and may be worthy your Honours and States consideration, in prevention of future abuses in this kind. It is not so with the Merchant that tradeth into other parts, if he bring in a Commodity that finds not that vent for it here, as he can have else-where, shippeth out again all, or part, receives back the Impost he himself formerly paid, which is but just, but these Committee-men of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company receive back the Impost, not onely of what concerns their own proportion of stock, but even what the whole body of Adventurers did formerly pay, and wherein they themselves had no reall interest, an abuse worthy refor∣mation
<PB N="19" REF="14"/> for the future, as having bin some years 40. or 50000l. loss, and more, to the State, as will appear upon the exami∣nation of their Accounts.</P>
<P>By the foregoing discourse, your Highness may in part see <NOTE PLACE="marg">The improvi∣dent way of trade which our Grandees have practised, appears in neg∣laect of trade from Port to Port, in India it self.</NOTE> the improvident way of trade, those great and wise men did run, even when they had so large and plentifull means, as was that of the second and great Joynt Stock: But when your Highness shall consider how wilfully negligent they have been of the trade between Port and Port, in <HI>India</HI> it self, you will, with admiration, wonder that such wise and understan∣ding Merchants, as they were, should commit such gross er∣rours; if not done on purpose to ruine the Action, which that your Highness may the better apprehend, and see the difference between the immediate trade from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Surratt,</HI> and <HI>Muslapatan,</HI> and thence back again for <HI>En∣gland,</HI> and that of one or two years imployment between <HI>Surratt,</HI> or <HI>Muslapatan,</HI> and the Southern parts, as to <HI>Ban∣tham, Acheen, Macassar,</HI> &amp;c. and thence back again to <HI>Sur∣rat,</HI> or <HI>Muslapatan,</HI> and so for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose there be twenty thousand pound in Rialls of Eight, <NOTE PLACE="marg">To the sending 20000 l. to <HI>Sur∣rat,</HI> there to be invested in Goods for <HI>En∣gland,</HI> may yeild here 23000 l.</NOTE> and Goods sent to <HI>Surrat,</HI> or <HI>Muslapatan,</HI> which might yeild there five or six thousand pounds profit, allowing 2000 l. to defray charges there, and there remains 23000 l. to be in∣vested in Indico and Callicoes, &amp;c. which sent directly for <HI>England,</HI> might, according to accustomed computation, have yeilded here three for one, or 69 thousand pounds, from which, allow 15 thousand pounds for fraight, assurance, for∣bearance of their money, customes, and other charges, and there remains 34 thousand pounds clearly gained; a faire recompence, if no unhappy loss befall it: but if that 23000 l. <NOTE PLACE="marg">But invested in Goods for the Southwards, and then re∣invested in Goods for <HI>Sur∣rat</HI> again, and then for <HI>Engl.</HI> would have made here 216000 l.</NOTE> in <HI>Surrat,</HI> had been invested in Commodities, fitting <HI>Ma∣cassar, Acheen, Janiby,</HI> and <HI>Bantham,</HI> would have yeilded two for one, at least, clear of all charges, or 46 thousand pounds; which again re-invested in Cloves, Maces, Nutmegs, Lignum Allois, Turtle shells, Camphir, Benjamin, China roots, Pepper, and other Druggs, would have made in <HI>Surrat</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> at least two for one more, or 92000 l. from which allow 20000 l. for customes, &amp;c. charges, and there had remained
<PB N="20" REF="15"/> 72000 l. to be invested in Indico, Callicoes, &amp;c. for <HI>England,</HI> which at three for one, is here 216000 l. a large Recompence for one or two years stay longer in <HI>India;</HI> all which, as a reall truth, will appear by their own Accounts, and the testi∣mony of their Servants, that have been in those imployments. This was the manner of trade used by the Portugalls and Dutch, to their exceeding great profit, as appeared to all the world; yet would our Court of Committees not be perswa∣ded thereunto, untill of late yeares, when Trade was over∣laid by the Dutch, and Shame, and the urgent pressures▪of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trade from Port to Port, is that which made the Por∣tugall, &amp; now the Dutch, to thrive.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Smithwick,</HI> and others, upon my information of the trade of <HI>India,</HI> began to look more narrowly into their impro∣vident waies, and neglect of trade, did inforce them thereunto.

<P>I am now come to discourse of that, no less rich than pro∣fitable trade for Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> wherein I must ingenuously <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trade for Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> cause of the loss of the <HI>Mollucca</HI> Islands, and all the best trades of <HI>India,</HI> China and Japon.</NOTE> confess I was in a Labyrinth of admiration and wonderment, when I considered the many inconveniences and mischiefs, which the ruine of this trade hath brought upon that of the <HI>East Indies</HI> inparticular, and the Common-wealth in generall: had it fallen alone, and perisht upon its own ruines, it had been a most heavy loss to this Nation: but to be the means and the cause of the loss of all the <HI>Mollucca</HI> Islands, and with them the best of the trade of <HI>India, China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> to the unspeakable prejudice of the Adventurers in the several Joynt Stocks, is worthy due consideration.</P>
<P>For the <HI>East India</HI> Action, strengthened with that great and powerfull means, as was the second Joynt Stock, was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Joint Stock was able to have carried all the trade of <HI>In∣dia</HI> against Por∣tugall and Dut. if rightly ma∣naged.</NOTE> able (if wisely managed) to have carryed all the best of the <HI>Mollucca</HI> Islands, and other trades in <HI>India, China,</HI> and <HI>Ja∣pon,</HI> in despight of all the force the Portugals or Dutch could have set in opposition, had it not met with many evil disposed people of their own Society, bound by Oath and publique Trust to advance that Action, to the utmost of their power and best endeavours.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
<P>Such were the Portugall Merchants, who, that they might have <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portugal Merchants ene∣mies to our Company tra∣ding for <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> have the furnishing of <HI>England,</HI> with all sorts of Spices, Indi∣co, and other <HI>India</HI> Commodities, as heretofore did rather desire the Portugall might hold that Trade to themselves, as in former times.</P>

<P>Yet were both these of little or no consideration (setting <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compa∣ny unwilling to plant them∣selves in <HI>India,</HI> because the State would place Gover∣nors and Com∣manders there∣in, as in other Plantations.</NOTE> apart that generall dislike, that the State should have any power or command in their Plantations) in respect of the Turkey Merchants, who would that neither the Portugals, Dutch, nor English, might injoy those so rich trades of <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c. much less that of the Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> that they onely might supply <HI>England,</HI> and other parts, with all those fore-mentio∣ned Commodities from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> especially with the Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> from <HI>Alleppo, Smyrna,</HI> and other Ports of <HI>Tur∣key.</HI></P>

<P>It may be here objcted, that the trade of <HI>India, Persia,</HI> &amp;c. if followed with a full stock, would carry out a great deale of treasure, and impoverish the Land of money: against which our State did wisely provide heretofore, by obliging the said Company, to bring in as much (if not more) than they did yearely transport, which, for some yeares, was duly obser∣ved, and may again, by this means, bring in greater quan∣tities by the proceed of Silk onely; besides, what other <HI>India</HI> Commodities do produce from <HI>Spaine, France, Italy,</HI> and other parts, from whence all the Treasure, which else would come for <HI>England,</HI> is now carried for <HI>Turkey</HI> to buy Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> which if brought directly from thence, by way of <HI>India,</HI> would not onely furnish the great expence of the Ma∣nufacture of Silk in this Land, but be a means to draw all that treasure (which is now carried into <HI>Turkey</HI> by other Nations, to buy Silk of <HI>Persia)</HI> into our own Country, to the great enriching thereof, especially in the increase of Treasure in your Highness's Exchecquer, beyond any means whatsoe∣ver.
<PB N="28" REF="19"/> If your Highnesse can obtaine from the King of <HI>Persia</HI> to renew the Contract for all his Silk, as formerly.</P>
<P>For, all that Silk the Merchant bringeth now from <HI>Turkey,</HI> is bought with ready money, at 14 s. the pound, or more, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Silk of <HI>Persia</HI> bought in <HI>Tur∣key</HI> with ready Money, which else would have been brought home.</NOTE> whereas it doth not cost in <HI>Persia,</HI> 8 s. at most, ready mony; our Cloath, and other Commodities, are sold in <HI>Persia</HI> for above 100 l. <HI>per</HI> 100 profit, Tinne almost three for one; in <HI>Persia</HI> we pay no Customes, which are ten in the hundred inwards, and as much outwards, never had Avenues or Mulcts laid on the Nation, whereas in <HI>Turkey,</HI> our Cloth, and other Commodities, seldome, or never, yeild 30. <HI>per</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Ships make as short a Voyage for <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis,</HI> as doe others from <HI>Scandarroon,</HI> af∣ter the first Voyage.</NOTE> 100 profit; pay heavy and great customes in and out, and have many Avenues put upon them every-yeare, in one place or other; our Ships also may make their Voyage in as short a time as usually from <HI>Scandaroon',</HI> after the first two yeares and a quarter, with much less danger of Pirats or other accidents, whereunto the other are inci∣dent.</P>
<P>But had our Company (as I said before) when they had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spices sent in∣to <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> would have yeilded 8. or 10. for one, profit.</NOTE> one third part of the Spices, sent a reasonable proportion in∣to severall parts of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> every yeare, it would have yeilded there eight, tenne, and more, for one, which would have raised the stock to such a value, as would have brought a large proportion of Silk from <HI>Persia,</HI> which again would have yeilded two one halfe for one, at the rate of 20 s. the pound, an indifferent and moderate price, and a very faire recompence for one yeares time spent in <HI>India:</HI> but our Company, governed by <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants, would never be perswaded to follow that trade from Port to Port in <HI>India,</HI> though never so profitable, fearing that their Stock <NOTE PLACE="marg">Unto which our Company would never hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken, nor heare of trade from Port to Port in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> would grow so rich and powerfull, as to be able to bring all, or the greatest part of the silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> by way of <HI>India,</HI> to their particular prejudice, whereby it too plainly ap∣peares that private interest is the ruine of all publique Acti∣ons.</P>
<P>Here falls in an Objection, which one of the prime mana∣gers of that trade, not long since, made to me, when in dis∣course I complained of the Companies neglect of that trade
<PB N="29" REF="19"/> for silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> of so great profit and consequence, as I did <NOTE PLACE="marg">Object: why the Dutch doe not buy silck of <HI>Persi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in return of spices and other Commo∣dities.</NOTE> then make appear to him, though he would not seem to ap∣prehend it; answered me, if that trade were so profitable as you say, why do not the Dutch fall into it, who carry not onely English Cloth, as we do, but even Spices, and other <HI>India</HI> Commodities also, yet do not invest the proceed thereof in Silk, which, if it did yeild so much profit as you say, they would not have so long neglected it.</P>
<P>Unto this I have in Answer two Reasons: First, that the Dutch made much more benefit by the Treasure they carried <NOTE PLACE="marg">Answered, that they make more profit of treasure they carry thence for <HI>China</HI> than they carry silk for <HI>Holland.</HI> Again, some of our Commit∣tees had made a private Con∣tract with the Dutch, not to being the silk of <HI>Persia</HI> into <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> To which end it may be sup∣posed, they neglected the receipt of their Customes in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> freely out of <HI>Persia</HI> into the <HI>Mollucca</HI> Islands, and <HI>China,</HI> to buy Spices, and Silk, and other Commodities for <HI>Japon,</HI> than the silk of <HI>Persia</HI> would have made at home in <HI>Holland;</HI> which he granted for good: A second reason was, that I had heard some Dutch in <HI>India</HI> (as I believe he had done the like) say that their Company had agreed with some of our Grandees, that if they, the said Dutch Company would forbeare the bringing of silk from <HI>Persia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> that might hinder their trade for it into <HI>Turkey,</HI> they would under-hand let fall all their complaints of the <HI>Amboyna</HI> Massacre, and other wrongs offered our people in <HI>India,</HI> or at least so slightly prosecute the same, as it should never come to any issue, as it hath not untill some few weeks past: unto this he very angerly replyed (for it went to the quick;) these are but sug∣gestions of those that have beene in <HI>India,</HI> and would faine possesse the General<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of Adventurers, of greater matters than can be expected, and so in passion break off our dis∣course, though in his own Conscience he knew it to be apa∣rent truth.</P>
<P>Here also your Highness may be pleased to observe, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch falling into the trade of <HI>Persia,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roubled our Company more than the losse of the Spice-trade.</NOTE> in the same Moneth of <HI>Feb.</HI> and yeare 1622. when our peo∣ple aided the King of <HI>Persia</HI> in the taking of <HI>Ormus</HI> from the Portugals, the Dutch executed their so inhumane but∣chery on our people in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and the yeare following fell upon the trade of <HI>Persia,</HI> where they had never been be∣fore; which later did more trouble the over-ruling Gran∣dees of our Company, than the losse of all the Spice-trade; yea, and of that of all <HI>India,</HI> which they have now brought
<PB N="30" REF="20"/> by a long and lingring Consumption, even to its last gasp, and must sodainly expire, if your Highnesse do not take it into your owne protection, and make it a State-action, by giving it new breath of life, and by Stock and Countenance revive <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which now languish for want of stock to keep up the Action.</NOTE> its decaying spirits, now out of all hopes of recovery by Joynt Stocks of Adventurers; so much disheartened by the wilfull Neglects and wrongfull abuses, improvident Courses of the former Managers of their Estates, that none but Mad-men or Fooles will put themselves upon the like againe, unlesse <NOTE PLACE="marg">None but mad-men or foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es will ven∣ture upon Joynt St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocks any more.</NOTE> better regulated in its government, or laid open and free for all men that have a mind to trade into those parts.</P>
<P>Much more I could say, as to the evill managing of that action, to the great hindrance of the particular Adventurers, and the whole Nation in generall; As also their great neg∣lects <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trade of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon</HI> neglected, have been very pro∣fitable to the Portugall and Dutch ever since.</NOTE> of those rich trades of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Iapon,</HI> such they have been heretofore to the Portugalls, and now to the Dutch, as one <HI>Iacob Mathews,</HI> a Dutchman, a few yeeres since, upon his going for <HI>Holland,</HI> and thence Commander of a Fleet for <HI>India,</HI> did tell me in discourse about the trade of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> that their Ships did bring thence every yeare 70 or 80 tunnes of Gold, which according to their computation, is 7. or 800 thousand pounds <HI>Sterl.</HI> a year: I have also heard some Dutch (some yeares since in <HI>India)</HI> say, that they did then send to <HI>Japon</HI> every yeare ten or twelve thousand Broad∣cloaths; if so many so long since, surely at this time many more: All which hath beene long since intimated to our Company, as most profitable trades (if rightly followed) yet would they never hearken thereunto, or any thing that ten∣ded to the advance of that Stock, lest growing rich, should fall upon the trade of Silk; by which means they not onely kept that Commodity to themselves, but cunningly traded <NOTE PLACE="marg">But our Comp. would trade for no more than them∣selves could take off in sup∣ply of their trade into, the Levant Seas, and else where.</NOTE> into <HI>India</HI> for no more than themselves could take off in supply of their owne trades into the <HI>Levant</HI> Seas and other places, at long time, and wrongfully rebates to the great hinderance of the Adventurers, so as if they lost a hundred pound a yeare a man, with the Adventurers in the generall Stock, they gained thousands by buying their owne Commo∣dities (as I said before.)</P>

<P>And when I call to minde the often boastings of <HI>Peter</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch suspected to have over-bri∣bed the Com∣mittee below,</NOTE> <HI>Vanderbrook,</HI> Commander of the Dutch in <HI>Surrat,</HI> that their Company had chains of Gold that would reach from <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> I rather believe they have over-bribed the Managers of that Action here below, than those Lords above, so much complained of to the Generality; had they had a minde to improve that trade to its best advantage, they had stock enough (besides the justnesse of their Cause) to have vyed stakes with the Dutch, especially here at home, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which hind ed their Com∣plaints above.</NOTE> where they could finde meanes sufficient to maintain an Ar∣bitrary power, to abuse and wrong their servants, or any man that laboured the good of that Action; so also could they find means to bribe, and keep Mr. <HI>Smithwick</HI> from a faire Hearing when he complained of their dishonest Procee∣dings: in these cases, and the like, they spared not the ge∣nerall purse; But to deale with the Dutch, in a businesse of so great concernment, they were over-sparing, as glad they had so good an excuse, as to fling the blame upon the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">On whom they flung all the blame in general Courts.</NOTE> and Lords of his privy Council, in all general Courts, which, together with their servants private trade in <HI>India,</HI> was alwaies the burden of their complaints to the general Adventurers (when as some of themselves had greater Adventures in pri∣vate, than in the general Stock;) with such false suggestions as these did they abuse the honest minded Adventurers, who simply believed them to be as honest, as rich, untill woful ex∣perience told them the contrary.</P>
<P>For can it be imagined, that so grave and wise men as they were in their own way should (like little children from whom <NOTE PLACE="marg">They wilfully lose one third part of the Spi∣ces, which they might have kept.</NOTE> if you take one of their play-games will fling all the rest a∣way) altogether decline that agreement of 1622. with the Dutch to have one third part of the Spice, upon the <HI>Mol∣lucca</HI> Islands, paying 1/3 part of the charge and cost, because the said Dutch had over-reacht them in the contract, and over-bribed them at Court, that they had not the satisfacti∣on they required, or but easily pursued, or was that a suffi∣cient reason because the late Kings and Lords (for some rea∣son of State then moving thereunto) did not presently repair them for the many injuries and great losses they had sustai∣ned,
<PB N="32" REF="21"/> that therefore they should abandon that agreement for Spices, which had they continued as they ought in Policy or common reason to have done, this company had not only prospered and flourished themselves, but had so hindered the Dutches designs, as they had never risen to that height of in∣solency they are now at.</P>
<P>Adde hereunto the long sufferance of the Dutches injuri∣ous proceedings which hath made them so insolent and pe∣remptory in <HI>India,</HI> that they dared before these times give Lawes to our people in those Seas, yea, and exact Duties and Customes in our passage thorough the Straights of <HI>Molluc∣ca,</HI> never yet paid by the English to any Nation; in requi∣tall whereof, your Highnesse may as well exact a Toll or custome of all the Dutch-ships that passe through the Nar∣row Seas, to pay a certaine custome for their ships, and goods, with much more of equity and right, and but justly pay them in their owne kinde, who spare us in nothing, whereunto they can pretend any the least shew of custome, how unjust soever.</P>
<P>But before I passe any further, be pleased to observe the wilful weaknesse (or rather neglect) of our Company, when <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣panies wilfull neglect of the Spice-trade into <HI>India,</HI> it self made ma∣nifest.</NOTE> they had the one third of all the Spices of the <HI>Mollucca</HI> Islands (as I said before) notwithstanding they had been ma∣ny, and oftentimes solicited by their servants in <HI>Surrat</HI> and <HI>Muslapatan,</HI> to send a large proportion of those spices into those Northern parts of <HI>India, Persia,</HI> &amp;c. where they would have yeilded as much money, or more, than in <HI>England,</HI> which again reinvested in Indicoe and other Commodities, would, after one yeares forbearance in <HI>India,</HI> have yeilded here at least three for one, and have excused the sending out 100 thousand pounds a year, sometimes in treasure; yet they would never be perswaded thereunto, as appeares by the fol∣lowing estimate.</P>

<P>A faire recompence, if wisely apprehended, yet would our Company never put the same in practice, which to some men may seem a strange mystery. But when your Highness shall consider, that that Court of Committees are the sole buyers and sellers of the Companies Commodities at their owne prices, and long time on rebate, and the benefit they make of the Impost they receive back at home, besides their gaine abroad, will soon judge them to have been more intentive on their own private profit, than the generall good of the Ad∣ventures, though bound by oath and conscience to act for the good of their Trustees.</P>
<P>For the managers of this action, being Aldermen and rich men over-ruling all at their owne pleasure, and to their own ends, being both Buyers and Sellers of their owne Commo∣dities, did so combine together, as to have all these Spices
<PB N="34" REF="22"/> brought home, that so they might buy them up at their own <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commit∣tees ingrosse all those Spices to their own pri∣vate ends.</NOTE> prizes, and long time of payment of five sixe Moneths, to rebate at five eight moneths, to supply their own trades, into the Levant Seas and elsewhere, by which Rebates and Imposts received back, they gained 48 one third, <HI>per</HI> 100. at least, before ever the Commodities went out of <HI>England,</HI> besides what they gained abroad.</P>
<P>It was heretofore observed, that so soon as the Muscovy <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Muscovy</HI> trade and stock ruined by the <HI>Turkey Mer∣chants,</HI> being Governors thereof.</NOTE> Company (which had raised (in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time) a great joynt Stock, began to look into the trade for Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> brought out of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and down the River <HI>Volga;</HI> the <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants cunningly made themselves chief rulers of that Company, and so handled the businesse, that in a few yeares, they not onely wrought a stop of that trade of Silk, by the River <HI>Volga,</HI> but even the ruine of the whole Stock, by their improvident way of trade, and over∣great and unnecessary charges, both abroad and at home, yet hath that trade, since the dissolution of that joynt Stock, been followed by particular men, managing their owne E∣states, thrived and prospered, before the late difference be∣tween the two States; and so may this trade of <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c. if laid open, and free for particular men, to trade upon their owne Stocks, managed by Agents or Consuls (as is that of the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Muscovie</HI> trade) prove very profitable and rich to this Common-wealth, unlesse it shall seem good to your Highnesse to make it a State action, as that which is most likely to be most honourable, profitable, and advantagi∣ous to this Nation, and Common-wealth, being rightly ma∣naged, by a new and better way of Regulation, and Govern∣ment, than heretofore hath been practised at home.</P>
<P>But to leave the resetling of these trades to the wisdome of your Highnesse and Councell of State, I shall humbly present <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commit∣tees work the ruine of <HI>India</HI> trade on pur∣pose to buy off dishertned peo∣ples adventures at half their value.</NOTE> unto your Highnesse some other dishonest proceedings, of those Grandees, and managers of this action; who of purpose to undervalue the same, and dishearten the Nobility, Gentry, Widdows and Orphans, and other Adventurers, not able to ride out of their Stocks any longer, so much, as to sell of their Adventures, as they did some hundreds of thousand pounds,
<PB N="35" REF="22"/> at 45. and 50. <HI>per cent.</HI> losse to themselves; and to this end, they imploy Mr. <HI>Thomas Smithwick,</HI> and others then Brokers upon the Exchange; But the said <HI>Smithwicke,</HI> understanding their designes and purposes, did serve himselfe and friends al∣so by buying many Adventures of the Nobility, Gentry, &amp;c. in hopes that being now become Adventurers, they might be∣come also Committees, and have an eye over the managing of that action in a better and more profitable way, than here∣tofore, and which indeed he did labour with much earnest∣nesse and complaints, both to the late King, and Lords of his privy Councell, but all in vaine, for they having the Generall purse, at command, and a Lord Keeper fitting their owne humour, spared not as I said freely to bribe at Court, to stifle, and suppresse all complaints, and in the end, so or∣dered the businesse, as he, and others were ruined and un∣done in the pursuit thereof.</P>
<P>Besides this designe of buying up of Adventures at under values, a most unjust and dishonest course, and breach of Oach and trust, they had a farther intention, which was, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">And gaine the Composition with the Dutch, to themselves, a most disho∣nest breach of trust.</NOTE> having by this meanes, got all, or the greater part of the Stock into a few of their owne, and confederates hands; they would then presse his Majesty and Lords, in a more earnest and importunate way then hertofore, to conclude the diffe∣rence with the Dutch, and so gaine that composition also to their owne advantage; all which will appeare by their owne accompts and papers, if duly examined.</P>
<P>As to the trades of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> I can say little to the particular Commodities either carryed thither, or brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">China and Ja∣pon have been to the Protu∣gals, and Dutch very rich Trades.</NOTE> thence, more than in the Generall. I am ascertained the <HI>Portugalls</HI> heretofore, and the Dutch now have, and doe make extraordinary profit, first between <HI>India,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> but especially between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> and thence back to <HI>Chi∣na,</HI> and thence again into <HI>India;</HI> and if the Dutch them∣selves do not vainly boast, they do carry many thousands of Broad-cloaths into <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon:</HI> it is likely we also might have made use of those so rich trades, had the mana∣gers of that Action heretofore been willing to advance that trade to its best of profit.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
<P>All which, notwithstanding those so rich trades of <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c. are no way to be esteemed the worst, because the managers thereof have not, made them so profitable to this Common∣wealth, as they have been to the Portugall heretofore, and are now to the Dutch, and may yet be unto us, if well regu∣lated under a State-protection hereafter, as the other have been, and are to this day.</P>
<P>Having thus presented to your Highnesse, the evil affecti∣on, wilfull miscarriages, and improvident courses, to the rui∣ning, if not utter suppressing of these so rich and profitable trades of <HI>India, Persia, Arabia, China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> practised by that Court of Committees, who have had the managing thereof these many yeaers; I shall humbly leave these to your Highness's and Council of States better judgements, for the future regulating thereof, in a more profitable way than hitherto, either by making it a State-action, as the best, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The best way to make the Trade of India profitable to this Nation, is, to make it State-action.</NOTE> most assured way of benefit and honour to the Nation, or by laying it open and free for all men, that have a minde and meanes to prosecute those Trades, being regulated, and or∣dered, as are the Turkey and Muscovy Trades, wherein eve∣ry man is Master of his owne goods, both abroad and at home, aad hath the ordering and managing thereof at his pleasure, and not tyed up to the many inconveniences of Joynt Stocks, and the dishonest ends of some particular o∣ver-ruling Committees, whose private Interest, and surrep∣titious wayes of Buying and Selling their owne goods, to themselves, break through all Oaths and breach of Trust, even to the ruine of the Adventurers stock, though to their owne particular profit enough advantagious; experience having told us, that joynt Stocks (as I said before) are but the worst of Monopolies, and meer Cheats, both to the State, and Ad∣venturers, and of all others, this of the <HI>East Indies</HI> the greatest.</P>
<P>But if your Highnesse can renew the former Contracts made with the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> 1622. and 1627. and enlarge that Trade, to the bringing all, or the greater part of the Silke of <HI>Persia,</HI> by way of <HI>India,</HI> and compell the Dutch to pay the one halfe of their Customes to your Highnesse, I
<PB N="37" REF="23"/> dare be bold, as will many others that have been in <HI>India,</HI> to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spice Islands, and the Con∣tract renewed with the King of Persia, for Silke, will make a rich trade.</NOTE> lay down a course and way of Trade, that one Million of Stock and Shipping, to be sent out in three years, shall re∣turne its first principall, with one million of pounds advance, before the end of two years &amp; a half, or three at most, &amp; then every yeare after, one million of pounds, all charges borne; which Trade alone, in few yeares will increase your High∣nesse Exchequer, and the Stock of the Nation, to such a large proportion, as will enable it to carry all Trades, and what else before them, in despight of all opposition.</P>
<P>I could say much more, in aggravation of the many and horrid injuries the Nation have received from the Dutch, but much more of the heavy losses, and wrongfull abuses, which some of that Court of Committees have occasioned; who over-ruling the more honest party by multiplicity of voices, and carrying all things to their owne ends, as profest enemies to that Trade of <HI>India,</HI> which so long as managed by such, shall never thrive, nor be worthy the name of an <NOTE PLACE="marg">A joynt stock by Turkey Merchants ma∣naged, never thrive.</NOTE> <HI>East India</HI> Trade; such as the Portugalls heretofore, and now the Dutch make of it, witnesse the large returnes these latter have made thence every yeare, of value at least 11. or 1200. thousand pounds, besides their large Stock remaining in <HI>India,</HI> and their many and rich Plantations they have there, to be valued at many Millions of pounds, all which they have obtained by the managers of our Stocks wilfull neglect, as much unwilling our State should have any insight, command, or interest in any of their Plantations; as not willing the action it selfe shoud thrive, and grow rich, for the reasons laid down in my foregoing discourse, which I hope will satisfie your Highnesse and Councel of State, as to the reality of the things therein proposed, together with the necessity of making it a State action, which will be the best, most safe, and profitablest way, for the honour and welfare of the Nation, being strengthned by your Highnesse Counte∣nance and protection, will put such terrour into all people, both farre and neere, as they will not dare to molest, or trou∣ble our just and lawfull proceedings, much lesse offer any re∣all wrong or injuries to the Nation as heretofore. When
<PB N="38" REF="24"/> protection was wanting to the Company, against the barbarous inhumanity of our false friends; as for the Por∣tugale, a declared enemy, we were able to right our selves on all occasions, had our Company sought to plant them∣selves on the <HI>Molucca</HI> and <HI>Banda</HI> Islands, as they ought to have done in the first place, as did the Dutch, and then to have beaten their way for Trade, into the North parts of <HI>India.</HI> The maine (if not wilfull) errour of our Company, in the Infancy of that Trade, so had we been Masters of all those forementioned rich Trades, to the great advancement of this Common-wealth, and Nation, which now may seem irrevocably lost, to the great shame and dishonour of this Common-wealth.</P>
<P>To conclude, those rich Trades of <HI>India, Persia, Arabia, China,</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> did never appeare in their true lustre and splendor, so much as in the time the Portugals had the sole Command of those trades in their owne hands, before either we or the Dutch had made any discovery thereof, when they had every yeare (if no Ships miscarryed) at least two Millions of pounds returned home on register, which paid customes to the King at high rates, besides Pearles, Diamonds, and other pretious stones of great value, which came unregistred, and paid no Customes. Of all which, the Dutch have endeavou∣red to make themselves Masters, and had accomplished, had not the English interposed a pedling trade (for other I cannot call it) whom they durst not totally oppresse and beat out of those Seas, however laboured by all the meanes they could invent, and the more upon our Companies neglect of Trade, which gave them the advantage of making them so rich, and powerfull, as to dare to contest with your Highnesse and State here at home, in hopes to have swallowed up the whole Nation in a Conquest, and so have made themselves the absolutest Commanders by Sea, that ever yet the world knew; and so have brought into subjection, not onely the East and West <HI>Indies,</HI> but even all other Trades throughtout the whole world; but being beaten into better behaviour by your Highnesse power by Sea, it is hoped your Highnesse may in time worke the same for our Nation, being vigilant and care∣full,
<PB N="39" REF="24"/> to keep those people under hatches, that they rise not a∣gaine to be able to hinder your Highnesses proceedings to that purpose; the true interest of this Nation being at this time to encrease its Trade, the onely meanes of making a Na∣tion rich, and powerfull, and able to give Lawe; by Sea to all the world, as being so well seated, and fortified by Nature in the Seas, that having a commanding Navy as your High∣nesse hath, and may have, able to suppresse all other neigh∣bouring Nations forces by Sea, before they grow over-po∣werfull, and able to give another encounter to yours, by com∣bining together to its ruine. By other meanes (except from Heaven) it is impossible the world can offend us, as not able to bring an Army into our Land, but by wooden Horses, which are, and must be our chiefest care to maintaine in their full forces; and able, if not to destroy all others, yet to de∣fend the Nation it selfe in safety.</P>
