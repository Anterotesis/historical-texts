<HEAD>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
Sir Robert Clayton,
LORD MAYOR ELECT
OF THE
CITY of LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Encouragement
the City-Trade and
Forein Discoveries is
like to find under
Your Lordship's Ma∣gistracy,
ought to be
the chief Encourage∣ment
of any Publick-spirited
Person to
render unto You all due Acknowledgments
and Testimonies of Honour in this kind.
The City of <HI>LONDON</HI> is doubtless the
Head and Promotress of all <HI>English</HI> Trade,
<PB REF="3"/>
and Your Lordship is the designed Head
and Representative of the City: That Obli∣gation
Forein Traffique hath to <HI>London, Lon∣don</HI>
oweth partly to the wise Councils and
Government of its Chief Magistrate, and
it scarce ever had any, of whose Prudence
Courage, and Moderation, it ought to con∣ceive
greater hopes than of Your Lord∣ship's.
Hard Weather needs Resolute Pi∣lots,
and Good Magistrates are ordinarily
sent by God against bad Times: And far be
it from us that we should make Times
worse than they are. But as it hath been
my bad more than my good Fortune to be
some years ago the first <HI>Avant</HI> Courier,
who from the Enemies Camp brought the
Tidings of these Hellish Attempts, that now
cause our Domestic Troubles; so I in this
Book present to Your Lordship, and all <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
an unavoidable and impartial Argu∣ment,
to shew that our Fears from Jesuitical
Practices are much less magnified, than
they are by them beyond measure extenua∣ted,
by a new Popish Device of Creating
Security: For herein Your Lordship may
see what the Jesuits are, where ever they get
Footing and Credit, in the furthest part of
<HI>Japon,</HI> as well as in <HI>Venice, Paris, Ireland,</HI> and
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<Q>Coelum non Animum mutant, cùm trans mare currunt.</Q>
<P>You shall observe (I say) how these <HI>Igna∣tians</HI>
Covetousness and State-undermining,
<PB REF="3"/>
brought the greatest Rebellion, Bloudshed,
and Massacre upon about 60000 Christians
at one blow, that ever was seen in those Ea∣stern
Parts of the World; and how thereby
some Hundred Thousands in after Persecu∣tions
were destroyed; may, and the whole
Christian Name quite extirpated (in hatred
of their Practices) by Heathen Monarchs,
who could not think their Heads, Crowns,
nor Estates, to be otherwise safe from the Fa∣ctious
Disciples of this <HI>Loyola.</HI> Yet all theirs,
and their secret Factors Devices, will (I
hope) come to nought, if we follow those
moderate, peaceable, and judicious Coun∣sels,
Your Lordship's Eloquent Speech hath
set out unto us; begetting a sober and
hearty Harmony 'twixt Prince and People.
If the Ship be kept in good order within,
there's little to be fear'd from Storms with∣out.
I remark, That it depended much
on the <HI>Tribunus Plebis,</HI> or Lord Mayor of the
old <HI>Rome,</HI> (most like to our <HI>London</HI> in Policy
and Magistracy) to keep it and the whole
Government in an even temper, and to
maintain a Lovely Correspondency be∣twixt
the Senat and the People; and it was
by him that the Enemies or Friends of the
Commonwealth ordinarily wrought their
ends of Peace or Disturbance. Therefore
as Your Lordship hath always appeared, as
well in your Actions as in your Words, a
Sincere and Brave-spirited Patriot, a Mode∣rate
and Reconciling Subject, it is not to be
<PB REF="4"/>
doubted but that Your Lordship will give
that Satisfaction to the Court, City, and
Country, and even to all Forein Traffiquers
themselves, that is justly expected and con∣ceived
of you. So that Quiet, Peace, Trade,
and Forein Discoveries, being encouraged
and promoted in your Times, your Name
shall be not onely respected and honoured
among your Countreymen, but also in
those remotest parts of the World, where
this small Work (most necessary for all
<HI>East India</HI> Merchants and Travellers) will
sound it out, and testifie with all the due
Respects and Obligations on the Public
Accompt of,</P>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE World being an ample
Volum, in whose Extent
and Varieties the Framer's
Wisdom and Attributes are
manifestly read and set out,
it seems that great Travel∣lers
are the best Scholars
and Proficients in this Book;
since on's Native Countrey is but as a single Leaf, where
all the Singularities are not to be seen which are found
in the other.</P>
<Q>—Non omnis fert omnia Tellus.</Q>
<P>And the truth of it is, those Ancient Philosophers,
who have first laid the Foundations of Arts, Sciences,
and Commonwealths in the World, were Travellers in∣to
these very Eastern Parts, (partly described by us
here) whence they brought home all their Knowledge;
it being here that Man and Knowledge it self had their
first beginning. So that wise Travellers are not un∣like
<PB REF="5"/>
those rich laden Vessels which through many dangers
bring wholesom and profitable <HI>Cargo's,</HI> Drugs, and
other Conveniences, to be dispers'd among the several
Societies of their own Countrey: They are like those di∣ligent
Master-Bees, who run divers miles to extract
out of many bitter Herbs that sweet Liquor, which they
afterwards kindly refund to be enjoyed at home in com∣mon,
in the hardest Seasons of the Year, by their Fel∣lows.
What costs them dear, others have it cheap:
And there's scarce any Private Persons in the Common∣wealth,
to whom we owe greater Honour and Thanks▪
than to Worthy Travellers and Discoverers of For<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>
Countries.</P>
<P>Yet it may be truly said, That Ancient Travellers
and Geographers have but as course Limners and
Coast-Drivers, drawn a very rough Draught in their
Relations of those Countries they describ'd unto us, in
comparison of some later Writers, who also sometimes
do but copy their Predecessors Stories; and Merchants,
with most other Travellers, are weather-driven by their
private Occasions or Misfortunes, to take but a Cur∣sory
Survey of Places, and so give but an answerable
account of the same to the World.</P>
<P>But among all the Ancient and Modern Travellers,
none had such fair Opportunities and Advantages as the
Illustrious Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> had, to make a true,
profitable, and exact Relation of the Singularities of
those Remote Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> where he past so many
<PB REF="5"/>
Years in great Splendour, as shall appear by the ensu∣ing
Considerations and Qualifications of a good Tra∣veller.</P>
<P N="1">1. He from his Youth had a strong Inclination to
Travel, which secret Instinct is certainly a Preordina∣tion
of God for an Undertaking; and this unseen Impul∣sion
carries such extraordinary Instruments chearfully
and prosperously through all the Difficulties, others of a
contrary disposition would never wade thorough, for
whom it would be in vain to strive against the current of
Nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Travelling <HI>Genius</HI> made him begin early
to fit himself for his design, and soon to go about it. He
was therefore sufficiently imbued in his Intellectuals with
all due knowledge of Sciences, Language, and Geogra∣phy,
and precedent Travellers Maps and Books, with∣out
all which common Travellers cannot conceive so soon
and so orderly, nor reap so much benefit for themselves or
others.</P>
<P N="3">3. But Speculations without Experience are but un∣profitable
Notions; and the Experiments of this kind
are not to be had without <HI>great Means and Ex∣pence,</HI>
for want of which many a good Undertaking is
Still-born.
<Q><L>Haud facilè emergunt, quorum virtu∣tibus
obstat</L>
<L>Res angusta domi—</L></Q>
<PB REF="6"/>
is an old and true Saying. But our noble <HI>Tavernier</HI>
had an ample Estate, drove a great Trade, had Money
in abundance, and a Prince's or Embassador-like Reti∣nue,
without which and great Presents none is scarce
look'd upon in Luxurious <HI>Asia,</HI> fit for admittance in∣to
great and worthy Companies, where Knowledge may
be attained; so that he thereby soon got into the Pre∣sence,
Familiarity, and Closets of the Emperours, the
Ministers of State, and the Philosophers of <HI>Persia,
Mogol,</HI> &amp;c. and got into the Acquaintance and Con∣versations
of the leading and common Merchants, Traf∣fiquers,
and People; and knew their Languages very
well: for it is in vain to have Eyes, if one have not also
a Tongue in such cases.</P>
<P N="4">4. And whereas Learning and Riches do sometimes
render narrow Souls of a more proud and unsociable
temper, Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> is by Nature and Edu∣cation,
an obliging, cheerful, and insinuating Travel∣ler,
and of a graceful Countenance. Comely Personages
are beloved almost as soon as they are seen; and those
that have but fair Souls, are not so till after they are
known. Now Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> having both these
Advantages, had a free entrance into the Friendship
and Notions the <HI>Indians</HI> (great or small) had con∣cerning
the Natural, Mechanical, Political, Religi∣ous,
and Trading State of their own Countrey; which he
made more his business to know, than to grow more rich.
<PB REF="6"/>
And at some times he would reckon Thousands of Pounds
as nothing to attain his ends in this point of Knowledge
and further Experience; as the perusal of this his own
Work, and Persons now in <HI>London,</HI> that knew him in
and after his Travels, can fully testifie.</P>
<P N="5">5. Moreover, Mutual Help of Persons equally un∣derstanding
and curious, is a great advantage in such
Researches and Observations as these. Now <HI>John
Baptista Tavernier,</HI> besides many other Heads and
Hands, had herein the Assistance of a Brother, as com∣plete
a Traveller as himself in those furthest Parts of
<HI>Asia,</HI> and had no less the foregoing Qualifications in
Person and Estate than this his Brother <HI>John Bap∣tista</HI>
had, as the Reader may well perceive by this Vo∣lum
of Travels.</P>
<P N="6">6. And as for the <HI>Time;</HI> Six Voyages, and about
Forty Years Abode in those Countries they do describe,
did render these Brethrens Knowledge vast, their Ex∣periments
tried over and over, and this their Account
more sure and exact (as I said) than that of any other
Traveller heretofore.</P>
<P N="7">7. And finally, to confirm the undoubted Credit
that's to be given to this Nobleman and his Relation,
(who is above all design of Flattering or Deceiving the
Reader) you may meet with several Worthy Persons
in this City and the Court of <HI>England;</HI> and I my self,
who was at <HI>Paris</HI> some few years ago at Monsieur
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Tavernier</HI>'s Arrival, and who can witness the grand
Esteem, the solemn Honours and Thanks, that were
then given him by Persons of all Ranks and Degrees,
the <HI>French East India</HI> Company's Admiration and
Recommendation of him, that he had done his King
and Countrey more Credit in those proud Eastern
Courts than ever any did before him; the <HI>French</HI>
King's imploying of him there; the Rarities he
brought home to the Learned; the vast Riches and
Memoirs he gained for himself, and the incomparable
Jewels and Singularities he brought to the <HI>French</HI>
King; the Titles of <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Baron</HI> conferred upon
him extraordinarily, though he were a Merchant and
a strict Protestant. These (I say) Public and Private
Testimonials do shew what Credit other Nations and
his own (which is Singular) had given to him. But
in a word his own Observations herein gathered will
prove it better.</P>
<P>But if any desire to have some Account of the Work
it self, the Newness, Profit, and Satisfaction the very
Subject must needs yield to all Persons and Professions
cannot but be acceptable.</P>
<P>The Naturalist shall have Plants, Minerals, Ani∣mals,
and <HI>Phoenomena's</HI> never seen in our Climate.
And about Physic, the Law, Music, and Poetry, more
<PB REF="7"/>
Time and Tryals are required in those Countries than
here; and you shall accordingly read of Cures done that
draw near to natural Miracles.</P>
<P>The Divine will see things worth his Observation in
their Religion and Morals, wherein they may confound
the very Christians; whereof I'le onely touch but thus
much: That by the Light of Nature those Heathens
own a Supreme Deity, and a Future State of Happi∣ness
and Torments; and do in view of the same most
strictly keep the Civil and the Ten Moral Command∣ments,
much answerable to ours, which their Prophets
have left to them. So that they punish Murther and
Adultery even in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tunquin ch. 7. p. 18.</NOTE> Princes and Princesses; terrible
Examples whereof you may here read at large. And
the Church and State Government are subservient in a
Subordination, the one being a Prop to the other.</P>
<P>Even Statesmen may find Subject of weighty conside∣ration,
in the Antiquity, Model, and Exactness of their
Government. As for instance: Though they have a
special regard to Monarchy, so as to keep the Succession
within the same Line; yet the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tunquin c. 11. p. 35.</NOTE> Great Constable, and
the King's Council have Power left them to propose and
chuse the fittest Person among the Royal Children, or Col∣lateral
Successors, who is nominated in the King's
Life-time, to prevent after Disturbances. They have
<PB REF="8"/>
also on the other side very singular and unimitable ways
to prevent the Insurrections, Divisions, and Rebellions
of the <HI>Militia</HI> and the People.</P>
<P>But above all, the Traveller and Traffiquer into
those Parts will be like to run into a thousand Inconve∣niences,
and Losses of Health, Life, and Estate, with∣out
being guided by such Directions as he carefully gives
herein, which others cannot possibly so soon and so well
know.</P>
<P>It is in fine herein declared, by what means the
<HI>French, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Portugal East India</HI>
Companies were Settled, Improved, and Worsted in
those Countries; also the Coinage, and the Reduction
thereof to ours; the particular places where all sorts
of <HI>East India</HI> Commodities are best and cheapest had;
the Rates and Exchange Returns are here to be found;
the manner how to know their Falsifications in Gold, Sil∣ver,
Jewels, Drugs, Silks, Linen, and all the other
Merchandizes which are brought from those Nations
are here set down: It being otherwise hard or impossible
to escape the Cheats of the <HI>Persians, Chineses,</HI> and
<HI>Japoners,</HI> without such Instructions.</P>
<P>I'le say no more, but that in this Work was imployed
the Help of another Worthy Gentleman, who labour'd
<PB REF="8"/>
in the first Volum of <HI>Tavernier</HI>'s Translation; but it
was brought to an end and perfection by me, who had
the occasion to be more particularly acquainted with
Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> himself, his Native Tongue, and
other Particularities abroad.</P>

<HEAD>A New and Particular
RELATION
Of the KINGDOM of
TUNQUIN:
With a MAP of the COUNTRY and
several FIGURES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Discourse in general concerning the City of Tun∣quin,
and of the Manner how the Author came
to have knowledge thereof.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI> has been long
unknown to the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> nei∣ther
have they, who have given us Rela∣tions
thereof, well understood the Coun∣try,
as having trusted too much to
defective and fabulous Descriptions and
Observations. Not that I am willing to be
over severe in censuring; but submissively I am bold to af∣firm,
That this which I here make Public was extracted out
of my Brother's Writings, of which I had the overlooking in
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
my second Voyage that I made to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and of which
I was the more confident, for that the Author had been
one who had made Eleven or Twelve Voyages from
<HI>Batavia, Bantam,</HI> and <HI>Achem,</HI> to <HI>Tunquin:</HI> Other Observa∣tions
I collected from the <HI>Tunquinesi</HI> themselves, with whom
I have had several Discourses, during the time that I was at
<HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> where they principally trade. And
that which gave me the more light was this, That those
Merchants several times bring along with them some of
their <HI>Bonze's</HI> or Priests, as also some of their Learned Men
to teach their Children to Write and Read. For these Mer∣chants
when they make a Voyage by Sea, carry all their
Families along with them. And from these <HI>Bonze's</HI> and
other Learned Men I had several Observations and Memoirs
in Writing, as being desirous to be inform'd by me of the
Government and Situation of our <HI>France.</HI> And as I was
never without an <HI>Atlas</HI> and some other particular Maps, they
were ravish'd with admiration, when I shew'd them the
Structure and Composure of the whole World, and the
Situation of its several Kingdoms and Estates.</P>
<P>Therefore may the Reader with the more pleasure and
delight peruse these Relations, when he has so much reason
to be persuaded that they are cordially done, and that they
are made public by a person whose sincerity has no design
to abuse him. My Brother, who was a person both cun∣ning
and couragious, and one that lov'd to Travel as well
as my self, having heard much talk in the <HI>Indies</HI> of the
Grandeur of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> resolv'd to go thither,
and as he had a particular gift to learn a Language in a little
time, he soon grew familiar with the <HI>Malaye,</HI> which is the
Language of the Learned in those quarters of <HI>Asia,</HI> as <HI>Latin</HI>
is among Us in <HI>Europe.</HI> He understood that Silk, Musk, and
other Commodities of the like nature, were much cheaper
there then in other places adjoyning, and that the People
dealt with more fairness and honesty. Upon the encourage∣ment
of which Information he prepar'd a Ship, and made
his Voyages with good success.</P>
<P>He always carri'd with him a good Sum of Money; and
more then that, he stor'd himself with a considerable number
of small Curiosities, to present the King and his Nobility,
according to the general Custom of all the Eastern Countries:
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
Thus he came to be well receiv'd the first time that he set
foot in the Country; so that the Customer being by him
oblig'd with a small Clock; a pair of small Pistols, and two
Pictures, which were the Pictures of two <HI>Curtesans,</HI> imme∣diately
gave notice to the King of his arrival. Thereupon
having order to attend the Court, and coming to kiss the
King's hands, the whole Assembly was surpris'd to hear a
Stranger, born in a Country so far distant, speak the <HI>Malaye</HI>
Language so fluently. The King gave him a favourable
reception, and kindly receiv'd the Present which he brought
along with him. It was a very noble Sword, of which the
Handle and Hilt were all over enchac'd with Rubies and
Emraulds, with a Backsword Blade. To this he added a
pair of Pistols, adorn'd and inlaid with Silver, a <HI>Persian</HI>
Saddle and Bridle, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, a
Bow and Quiver full of Arrows, and six Pictures, like those
which he had given the Customer. These things highly
pleas'd the King, who presently drew forth the Sword out
of the Scabbard, the better to look upon and consider it. At
length one of his Sons took it up, to try whether it would
fit his hand as well as those of his own Country, and offer'd
to make a blow. My Brother, seeing the young Prince
handle the Weapon gracefully enough, after the manner of
the Country, told the King, that if he pleas'd, he would
show the King how they handled that Weapon in <HI>France,</HI>
of which the King readily consented to be a Spectatour.</P>
<P>This was my Brother's first Reception at Court; for he
made several Voyages to <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and every time that he
return'd, they still the more and more obligingly entertain'd
him. But that which fix'd him more in the good opinion
and favour of the King and Lords of the Court, was his
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="broken" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>olic and gentile behaviour in playing with them for several
large Sums, insomuch that being one that ventur'd deep;
he lost above 20000 Crowns in one Voyage. However
the King, who was a generous Prince, would not suffer him
to be a loser, but gave him those considerable Presents that
suppli'd his losses. By means of my Brother's thus long
sojourning in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and the familiar acquaintance which
he had at Court, together with the Trade which he drove
in the Kingdom, as he was diligent to inform himself of all
the Curiosities of the Country, it was easie for me upon
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
the same foundation to lay the Structure of these Memoirs.
Though I may safely say, I was no less laborious in my
own particular, and by the frequent Discourses which I had
with a great number of the <HI>Tunquineses,</HI> with whom I met
both at <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI> that came thither to Trade, and
whom I often treated at my own Expences, to inform
my self of the particular Ceremonies and Customs of their
Country.</P>
<P>Thus you see the Grounds and Foundations of this Rela∣tion,
which is both faithful and exact, and by which that
noble Country, of which the Descriptions hitherto have
been so obscure and uncertain, shall be truly discover'd and
set forth, such as it is; declaring withal, that no other Con∣sideration
or Interest, then that of speaking truth, has incited
me to undertake this Description.</P>
<P>For the better observation of a right Method in pursuance
of this Relation, and to conduct the Reader <HI>gradatim</HI> to
the more perfect knowledge of this Kingdom, I will speak
first of its Situation, its Extent, and its Climate. Next I
shall come to discourse of its Qualities, its Riches, and its
Trade, which are the three Springs and Sources of the
Strength and Force of a Nation. Next I shall give an Ac∣count
of the Customs and Manners of the People as well in
their particular OEconomy and Civil Society, as in relation
to their Marriages, their Visits and Festivals. Next to this
we shall give a brief Account of the Learning, and learned
Men, and among them of their Physicians, and the Subject
of their Art, that is to say, of the Diseases particular to the
Country. We shall also give a Relation of the Original of
the Government and Policy of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> of
the Condition of the Court, of the Inauguration and Fune∣rals
of their Kings, and in the last place of the Original of
the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And I dare ingage, that the Map of the Country, and the
Cuts which were drawn upon the place, will no less contri∣bute
to the Divertisement of the Reader, then to the Expla∣nation
of the Matter which they contain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Situation and Extent of the Kingdom
of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall have the less reason to admire where∣fore
our Predecessors had so little knowledge
of this Kingdom, when we consider that
having formerly been a considerable part of <HI>China,</HI> the In∣habitants
in the same manner as the <HI>Chineses</HI> did, kept them∣selves
close within their own bounds, never minding to
have any Commerce with other People, whom they con∣temn'd
and lookt upon as <HI>Barbarians</HI> come from the other
part of the World. But now that they find that Strangers
come to find them out in their own Territories, they begin
to see that other People have as good Government as them∣selves;
which has bred in them a desire to Converse and
Trade with Foreigners; so that now they associate them∣selves
in friendly manner with all other People, as I have
observ'd them to do both at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Bantam.</HI> Most
people believe this Country to lye in a very hot Climate;
nevertheless it is now known to be very temperate, by
reason of the great number of Rivers that water it; which,
together with the Rains that fall in their Seasons, cause a
brisk freshness of the Air; which indeed happ'ns most
usually over all the <HI>Torrid-zone,</HI> as I have observ'd in my
<HI>Indian Travels.</HI> From whence we may also have reason
to believe the Country to be very fruitful and thick inha∣bited.</P>
<P>To the East this Kingdom lies upon the Province of <HI>Cau∣ton,</HI>
one of the best of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>To the West it is bounded by the Kingdom of <HI>Brama.</HI></P>
<P>To the North it borders upon two other Provinces of
<HI>China, Junnan</HI> and <HI>Quansi.</HI></P>
<P>To the South it lies upon <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and the great Gulph
of the same name.</P>
<P>To return to the Climate, the Air is so mild and tem∣perate,
that all the year long seems to be but one continual
Spring; Frost and Snow are never there to be seen; and
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
besides, the Pestilence, the Gout, the Stone, and other
Diseases so frequent in <HI>Europe,</HI> there are never known. There
are but two Winds, which divide the whole Year between
them; the one blowing from the North, the other from
the South, and both continuing the same for six months
together. The first refreshes the Earth in that manner, that
there is nothing so delightful as the Country of <HI>Tunquin.</HI>
The other begins to blow from the end of <HI>January</HI> to the
end of <HI>July;</HI> and the two last months are their months
of rain. The greatest inconvenience is, that there
arise once in seaven years, as well in this Country as
in other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> those hideous and terrible
Tempests, that blow down Houses, tear up Trees
by the roots, and make strange Desolations. They seldom
last above four and twenty hours, nor are their sad Effects
to be felt but only upon the Seas of <HI>China, Japon, Cochin∣china,
Tunquin,</HI> and the <HI>Manilles,</HI> being rarely known in any
other Seas.</P>
<P>The Astrologers of those parts believe that these terrible
Tempests proceed from the Exhalations that rise out of the
Mines of <HI>Japon.</HI> It comes with that suddain force that when
it surprizes a Vessel out at Sea, the Pilots have no other
remedy then to cut down all the Masts, that the storm
may have the less force upon the Ship.</P>
<P>In this fair extent of Land, almost equal to that of <HI>France,</HI>
are several Provinces, whose limmits are not well known;
the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> being no great Geographers, nor having bin
over curious to write the Annals of the Nation. But the
most understanding and knowing among them assur'd me at
<HI>Batavia,</HI> that the whole Kingdom contain'd above twenty
thousand Cities and Towns. They also affirm'd that there
might be many more, but after the manner of their Neigh∣bours
the <HI>Cochinchineses,</HI> many of the People choose rather to
upon the Water then upon the Land; so that you shall see
live the greatest part of their Rivers covered with Boates,
which serve them instead of Houses; and which are very
neat, though they also keep their Cattel in them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Quality of the Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>THis Country for the most part is a level Extent,
which rises up and down into pleasant Hillocks;
the greatest Hills which it has lying to the North.
It is water'd by several Rivers which inter-cut and glide
through the Country: some of which carry Galleys of
good burthen, and large Shallps, very commodious for
trade. Yet in all the Country there grows neither Corn
nor Wine, by reason of the want of rain, which never falls
but in the Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> But it bears an infinite
quantity of Rice, which is the chief sustenance of the
People. Of this Rice also they make their Drink, besides
which they have good <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> or Strong-water. Their
Fruits are excellent, but much different from ours, as are also
the Trees that bear them. The chiefest of these Trees are
the Palm-tree, which bears a Fruit bigger then in any part
of <HI>Asia.</HI> The Nut is about the bigness of a Man's Head,
in shape like a <HI>Coco</HI>-nut; the Shell is very hard, and being
open'd, the Pulp within is as white as Snow, having a tast
like our Almonds, and every one of the Fruits contains
about two glassfuls of Liquor, very refreshing and pleasing
to the Palate. The <HI>Gogavier,</HI> very much resembles our
Lawrel, of which there are two sorts; the one bears a
Plum, green without and red within: but the Fruit of the
other Tree, which is in much more esteem, is yellowish
without and white within, the top of the Fruit being like a
small Nosegay: the Pulp is full of small Kernels, less then
those of a Pomegranate; and if they be eaten before they
are ripe they bind the belly, whereas being eaten when
they are come to full maturity they work a contrary effect.
Formerly this Fruit was not known in the Kingdom of <HI>Tun∣quin,</HI>
but after the <HI>Portugals</HI> seated themselves at <HI>Macao,</HI> they
carri'd several Plants thither, so that now the Fruit is grown
very common. The <HI>Papager</HI> bears a Fruit which very much
resembles a small Melon, the tast whereof is very delicious.
The <HI>Arager</HI> grows upright and streight, like the Mast of a
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
Ship, bearing no Branches but at the top; which makes it
appear like a Crown. The Fruit which it produces is like a
Nutmeg, but a little more round. The People break this
Nut, and bruising it together with <HI>Betlè</HI> leaves, mix both with
a little Chalk, and make use of the Powder to keep their
Teeth clean, to dye their Lips of a Vermilion colour, and to
keep their Breath sweet.</P>
<P>They have but two sorts of Figs, the one like ours, and
the other like those which are call'd <HI>Adam</HI>'s Figs, as long as a
Man's finger.</P>
<P>There is also another Tree, very like our <HI>Willow,</HI> which
they call the <HI>Powder Tree,</HI> because that of the Wood they
make Charcoal, and of the Coal a Powder which they make
use of in their Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jambager</HI> is another Tree, that grows very high,
which bears a Fruit about the bigness of a Citrul-Cucum∣ber,
the Pulp whereof is full of Kernels like a Granate, very
cooling and pleasant, and very frequently eaten in the Season
of heat.</P>
<P>The High-ways are also planted with Trees on both sides
for the convenience of Travellers: And there are some of
these Trees so big that two or three thousand men may stand
under them, like that at <HI>Ormus,</HI> or <HI>Bandar Abassi,</HI> by me
describ'd in my Relations of <HI>Persia,</HI> and of which many
other Travellers have made mention. When the Branches
of these Trees are about ten or twelve foot long, there issue
forth other little Branches which turn downward, and by
little and little descending to the ground, take root and
afterwards become as it were so many Pillars to support the
<HI>Master</HI>-Branches. There are some of the <HI>Master</HI>-Branches
three hundred Paces long, which are supported by these out∣growing
Branches at the distance of every ten or twelve
foot. The Fruit is of the bigness of one of our great Nuts,
the Shell whereof is red, containing within nothing but a
Kernel like a grain of Millet. The Rere Mice feed upon 'em,
and also make their Nests in the trees. These Rere-mice
are as big as a good Pullet, insomuch that their Wings are
above a foot and a half long. They never light upon the
tree like other Birds, but you shall see them all the day long
hanging at the branches of the trees, fasten'd by their Claws
to the tree with their heads downward. Upon every Wing
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
they have seven as it were little Hooks or Claws, so that
being shot, they never fall to the ground, but remain fixed
to the branches, that at a distance you would take them to be
some great Pears that hung upon the tree. They are ac∣counted
a great dainty among the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who leave their
Pullets to eat them. 'Tis true that their Flesh is very white,
and when they are young they are a delicate sort of Diet.
I happen'd to eat of them two or three times with the <HI>Por∣tugals,</HI>
who thought they had oblig'd me with a great dainty;
and had I not known what they were, I should have taken
them for Pullets. And now I am talking of the Delicacies
of the Country, I will tell you of one sort of Dyet which
is very singular. This Food is the Nest of a certain Bird
which is no where to be found, but in the four Islands that
lie upon the Coast of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and of which you have
the Figures in the Table <HI>A, B, C, D.</HI> These Birds are about
the bigness of a Swallow, and build their Nests in such a
manner, that they are neither too close compacted, nor alto∣gether
transparent; they are like an Onion compos'd of
several rings and envelopings; that compose a Nest of a cer∣tain
sort of <HI>Gunim,</HI> which is steep'd in warm water, and mix'd
with all the Sawces which are made both for Fish and Flesh.
It is transported all over <HI>India</HI> and into <HI>Holland</HI> for Curiositie's
sake. You would believe in eating those Meats which are
season'd therewith, that those Nests were compos'd of all
the Spices in the Orient. I have not only brought this Diet
into <HI>France,</HI> and presented of it to several Persons of Quality,
but I have also my Vouchers for the truth of what I relate,
several of my Friends who have brought it from <HI>Holland,</HI>
among the rest <HI>M. de Villermont,</HI> whose Name is famous for
his Travels into the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> He and all those that have
eat thereof agree with me, that all the Spices of the <HI>East</HI>
put together, do not give that effectual relish and savour
as these Nests do, to the Meats and Dishes wherein they
are us'd.</P>
<P>Near to these four Islands, where these Birds Nests are
found, are five others mark'd in the Map 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
In these five Islands are such infinite number of <HI>Tortoises,</HI> and
such excellent Food, that the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> and <HI>Cochinchineses</HI> do
not believe they have entertain'd their Friends at a Banquet
as they ought to do, till the <HI>Tortoises</HI> are brought in. Those
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
two Nations pickle up great quantities of them, and send
them abroad, which is a vast trade among them; and indeed
the chiefest occasion of the Wars between them is, because
the <HI>Cochinchineses</HI> do all they can to hinder the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> to
fish for them, alledging that those Seas and Islands belong
to them. Neither is the Meat but the Shell also of great
esteem, and one of the greatest Commodities for Trade in
<HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tunquin</HI> also affords great store of <HI>Anana's</HI> and Orange
trees, of which there are of two sorts: the one that bears
a Fruit no bigger then an <HI>Abricot;</HI> the other bigger then
those of <HI>Portugal:</HI> both alike in tast, and being to be gather'd
from the tree for six months together. They have also two
sorts of Citrons, the one yellow, the other green; but both
the one and the other so tart and sow'r, that they cannot be
eaten without offence to the Stomach. Nevertheless, the
Juyce is made use of as we do here of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> to cleanse
Copper, Tin, and Iron, before we gild those Metals, as
also for Tinctures, especially those of Silk. They are also
made use of for Lyes to whiten Linnen, and to take out
Spots. Through all the Territories of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> they
make use of this Juyce of Citrons to whiten their Calicuts;
whereby they make them sometimes so white that they dazle
the sight.</P>
<P>They make great quantities of Silk in the Kingdom of
<HI>Tunquin,</HI> of which both rich and poor make themselves
Garments. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who thrust themselves in every
where, where there is any hope of gain, carry off such a
quantity every year, that it is now become the chiefest part
of that Commodity which they carry to <HI>Japon;</HI> whereas
before they fetch'd their Commodities from <HI>Persia, Bengala,</HI>
or <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>As for sweet smelling Flow'rs, the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> have but
one sort, which they call the Flow'r of <HI>Bague.</HI> It grows
like a large Nosegay, and the Branches of the Shrub that
bear it, spread themselves crawlingly upon the ground. As
they have great store of Sugar, so they eat very much, while
it is yet in the Cane, not having the true Art to refine it: and
that which they do grosly refine, they make into little Loaves
weighing about half a pound. They eat very much, making
use of it always after Meals to help digestion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Through the whole Kingdom are neither Lions, Asses,
nor Sheep; but the Forests are full of Tigers, Harts, and
Apes, and the Fields are full of Beeves, Cows, and Hogs.
As for Hens, Ducks, and Turtles, they are not to be num∣ber'd,
which is the general Provision for their Festivals.
Their Horses are very well shap'd; of which there are
always five or six hunder'd in the King's Stables; He also
keeps the same number of Elephants, of which some are
for the Service of his House, the rest bred for the Wars.
These Elephants are of a prodigious bigness, neither are
there any so tall nor so nimble in any part of <HI>Asia;</HI> for they
will bow themselves, and stoop so low, that you may get
upon their backs without help. They have no Cats, but
they have Dogs that serve for the same purpose, and will
watch all night to kill the Rats and Mice, which are very
large and very troublesom. Very few Birds are to be seen
in the Air, which toward the evening grows duskish, by
reason of those vast number of Gnats that get into the
Houses in the night time and hinder people from sleeping,
not only by the noise which they make, but with their con∣tinual
stinging; which is one of the greatest inconveniencies
of the Country. For remedy whereof in some measure,
an hour before they go to sleep they take the Husk or Chaff
of the Rice, which flies from the Rice when it is beaten, and
strew it upon a small Fire in a Fire-shovel, and so let it smoak,
and by that means they kill or drive those Flies away. Be∣sides
this, they cover the Bed with a Pavilion or Tent that
trails upon the ground, made like a Net with very small
holes to let in the Air. But notwithstanding all the pre∣vention
can be us'd, they will be about a man when he rises
i' the morning. But there is yet a far greater inconvenience
in this Country, which proceeds from the infinite numbers of
white Emmets, which though they are but little, have teeth
so sharp, that they will eat down a wooden Post in a short
time. And if great care be not taken in the place where
you lock up your Bales of Silk, in four and twenty hours
they will eat through a Bale, as if it had been saw'd in two in
the middle. Several of them have fallen from the Ciel∣ing
into my Neck, where they rais'd Blisters upon the
Skin, which presently fall again being wash'd with cold
Water.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18"/>
I have told you that Hens and Ducks are infinitely nume∣rous
in <HI>Tunquin;</HI> I will now tell you how they preserve the
Eggs of these Creatures, which they will keep for two or three
years together without being spoil'd. They salt them, and
to make them take salt, they fill a Vessel full of Water, and
throw a good quantity of Salt into it. If the Egg sink to
the bottom, the Pickle is not good; then they throw in
more Salt, till they find that the Eggs swim. The Pickle
being thus made, they take Ashes, and make them up into
a Past with this Pickle: and in this Past they enclose every
Egg by it self, and then wrap it up in a leaf of an Herb,
not unlike one of our Pear-tree leaves, but much larger, and
then put the Eggs into Earthen Pots close cover'd: after
which manner they keep their Eggs for two or three years
together.</P>
<P>In other parts of the <HI>Indies</HI> where there is great store of
Oyl, as in the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> the Kingdoms
of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and <HI>Arochan,</HI> they put their Eggs into great Earthen
Pots well varnish'd, and then fill the Vessel with an Oyl
which is made of a small Seed like Rape-seed. For as for
Sallad Oyl, after you are once pass'd <HI>Aleppo,</HI> you see no more
Olive-trees over all <HI>Asia,</HI> but only in one place of <HI>Persia</HI> near
<HI>Casbin,</HI> where between the Mountains lies a little Valley,
about a League long and half a League broad, full of Olive-trees,
but they make but very little Oyl, preserving the
Olives only to eat. But to return to the Eggs; they are the
chief Provision which they eat a Ship-board. But the Eggs
which are preserv'd in Salt are preferr'd much before those
that are kept in Oyl; because that in using the first, there is
no need of carrying Salt to Sea, or of boiling Salt with their
Rice. When they eat them, they boil them till they are
hard, and with every mouthful of Rice they eat a Pea's
bigness of Egg, which is as good and better then Salt with
their Rice. As to what remains, there are neither Mines of
Gold nor Silver in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> neither do they
Coin any Money.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Riches, Trade, and Money of the
Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief Riches of the Country of <HI>Tunquin</HI> consist in
the great quantity of Silks which they sell to the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> and other Foreigners, and in their <HI>Lig∣num
Aloes.</HI> Of which there is some worth a thousand Crowns
the Pound, according to its goodness and oyliness. There
is some that is not worth above three Crowns, but it is dry
and good for nothing but to make Cabinets, or Beads to
hang about Womens Necks. All the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> especially
such as let their Beards grow, make great account of this
Wood; and when they give a Visit, they presently bring a
little Chafing-dish, and cast a small piece of this Wood
upon the Coals, which yields a smoak and pleasing mist;
with which they perfume their Beards, at the same time
lifting up their hands to Heaven, and crying, <HI>Elhemed Illah,</HI>
or <HI>God be thanked.</HI> If the Wood be oily, the bigness of a Pea
will serve to throw upon the fire, which being a little
moisten'd in Water, will yield as much smoak as a dry piece
as big as a Man's fist. Which is the reason, that if it be
oily and good it wants no price. One of the chief Presents,
as I have observ'd in another part of this Book, which
the <HI>Portugals</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> sent to the Emperor of <HI>Japon,</HI> was a
piece of <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> six foot long, and two round. It
cost 40000 <HI>Pardo's</HI> or 54000 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>It is so much the more pleasure and profit to trade with
the People of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> by how much the more faithful and
frank they are in their dealing then the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who will
deceive you if they can; so that it is a hard thing to be too
cunning for them, as I have often found by experience.
When you have sold them any Commodity, and they find
that their Bargain is not very advantageous, their general
way of getting off is this: As they have generally three
sorts of Reals, one sort that is full weight, others which are
light, four, others eight <HI>per Cent</HI> if they have no mind to
stand to their bargain, they offer to pay you for your Goods
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
in light Reals, which they have clipt themselves, and so
you are deceiv'd. There are no such People for Trade in
the World: they refuse to deal in nothing, even in old
Shoes, and if you will sell them but one of them too, they'l
buy it, without ever enquiring why you will not sell the
other. But for those of <HI>Tunquin</HI> they are more blunt and
plain in their dealing, so that it is a pleasure to have to deal
with them. I have told you, there are neither Mines of
Gold or Silver in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> neither do they Coin Money
there. So that in Trade they make use of certain Lingots
of Gold, as they are brought out of <HI>China,</HI> some of which
amount to 300 Livers of our Money, others to six hun∣der'd.
They also make use of Bars of Silver as they are
brought from <HI>Japon.</HI> As for small Payments they either
cut the large Bars into small pieces, to which purpose they
have their Scales, like our <HI>Stelleers;</HI> or else they pay in
Foreign Coin, which are the Reals of <HI>Spain</HI> generally. This
Gold and Silver is brought from <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> in lieu
of those vast quantities of Silk which are exported out of the
Country, which with Musk and <HI>Lignum Aloes</HI> are the chief
Riches of the Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Strength of the Kingdom of Tunquin
by Sea and Land.</HEAD>
<P>THey who have written before me concerning the
Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> have spoken largely of its
Forces both by Sea and Land, and allow it a pro∣digious
number both of Souldiers and Galleys. They write
that the Forces which were usually wont to meet at the Ren∣devouz
were 12000 Horse, 2000 Elephants, as well to carry
the King's and the Nobilities Tents and Baggage, as for the
Service of the War, 300000 Foot, and 300 Galleys. And
in regard the Kingdom is well stor'd with Provision and
Ammunition, that in time of War the whole Army ex∣ceeds
500000 Men. But the number which my Brother</P>

<HEAD>The King of Tunquin's Setting out for
the War.</HEAD>
<P>1. The King going out of his Palace is carried in his <HI>Palan∣quin</HI>
or Chair by the Chief Officers of his Houshold.</P>
<P>2. The Order of the King's March when he goes to the War.</P>
<P>3. The Musicians and Trumpeters who follow his Chair.</P>
<P>4. An Officer who carries a Bason full of Water, on which doth
float a Brass Boul with a hole in the bottom of it; so that exactly in
an hour this Boul becomes full of Water, and suddenly sinks to the
bottom.</P>
<P>5. Then presently two other Officers do strike the Hour upon two
great Brass Platters, N. 5. of about a Yard Diameter, and much
after the Form of our Burning Glasses, yet of the Metall that Bells
are made of, which causes that they are heard a very far off.</P>
<P>Afterwards he that carries the Bason of Water takes up the Cup
from the bottom, and sets it again a swimming atop of the Water, just
as it was before. When it is full and sinks, they after the same
manner strike on the said Platters. And this is their way of reckon∣ing
the Hour and Times in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
almost throughout the Eastern Parts betwixt the <HI>Tropicks;</HI> for
that the Clocks which are made in <HI>Europe</HI> become useless in
those Countries during the Rainy Season, the Air being there so
heavy and damp, that all Iron and Steel, nay the very Knives and
Watches in peoples Pockets do grow rusty, though you wrap them up
never so well in Cotton or Leather, and take all the care imaginable
to keep them dry; yet it will be impossible otherwise to preserve them
from Rust, than by letting them lie in Oyl while that Weather lasts.</P>
<P>This Foggy Dampness of the Air is predominant as soon as you are
past <HI>Persia,</HI> in all the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey, from the Fifteenth of <HI>June</HI>
to the end of <HI>September.</HI> The further one goes on toward the East,
the later these Rains do begin and are met withall.</P>
<P><PB REF="20"/>
It's good likewise to observe, that in the Empire of the Great
<HI>Mogul,</HI> in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and in other Easterly Parts between the <HI>Tro∣picks,</HI>
they do as we divide the Day and Night into 24 Hours, ma∣king
the Day of 12, and the Night to be of as much; so to proportion
equally the Times of Working and of Rest. But they do subdivide
both the Day and the Night into 4 equal parts, and this Division is
made known by the Strokes given upon those Platters. As for Ex∣ample:
The first Hour of the first Watch of the Night is mark'd by
one Blow, the second by another, and the third likewise by another.
In the second Watch of the Night the first Hour is made known by
two Blows one after another, and so of the rest untill the third Watch;
then at the first Hour of that they give three Strokes. And this Or∣der
is observed till the last Hour of the fourth Watch, which is mark'd
by four Knocks. In this manner they continue to marck the first
Hour of the day with the same Regularity.</P>
<P>All Persons of Quality do keep Eight Officers on purpose for this
Imploy; who likewise are to have a care of keeping the Palace Gates.
This Engine for the marking of the Hours is ordinarily hung up at the
Entry of great Palaces near the Porter's Lodge.</P>

saw in the year 1649, when the King was preparing to
make War against the King of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> for certain Ships
which the <HI>Cochinchineses</HI> had taken from the <HI>Tunquineses:</HI>
though the Quarrel was taken up by certain Embassadors
which the King of <HI>Cochinchina</HI> sent to the King of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> to
whom the former made satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Army that was then prepar'd to march upon this
Expedition was compos'd of 8000 Horse, 94 thousand Foot,
and 722 Elephants; 130 for the War, and the rest to carry the
Tents and Baggage of the King and the Nobility; and 318
Galleys and Barks, very long and narrow, with Oars and
Sails; and this was that which my Brother saw. The Con∣dition
of the Souldiery is very toilsom and laborious, and
of little advantage in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> For they
are all their life time so ti'd and engag'd to the Service of
the Wars, that though they are capable of other Labours
for the support of their Families, they are not permitted to
undertake it. Those days that they are not upon the Guard,
they are oblig'd to attend their Captains where-ever they
go, and two days in a week they are compell'd to Exercise
with their Bows and Arrows in their presence. Their Com∣panies
consist of a hundred or a hundred and thirty Men;
and they of each Company that have made the best shot,
have one of them two Months Wages, the other one, which
is paid them in Rice. He that makes the worst shot, next
time he mounts the Guard, is oblig'd to stand Centinel
double his time. All the Captains look upon it as a great
piece of glory to have their Souldiers Arms and Weapons
neat and bright. If they find any rust upon them, they
sconce them eight days Wages for the first fault, and for the
second they are very severely chastis'd. As for those that
serve in the Galleys, they are entertain'd and listed propor∣tionably.
And sometimes the Captains send their Souldiers
aboard for some days, that they may learn to row. For it
is one of the chiefest Pastimes of the Kings of <HI>Tunquin</HI> to see
the Mock-fights of the Galleys. When he has a mind to
delight himself with this Divertisment, the King, with some
part of his Court, removes to one of his fair Palaces, that
stands upon one of the largest Rivers in his Country; and
it is a great Honour for any of the Captains whose Souldiers
carry the Victory. Now as the Victory is only got by the
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
force of the Oars, it happens sometimes that there are some
Souldiers who strain themselves so hard, that they fall down
dead with the Oar in their hands: for the King is the only
Judge of the Combat. Wherein the pleasure that he takes
is such, that he sends an Elephant to the Captain that obtains
the Victory, and gives him three Months Wages besides.
If any Souldier chance to die in this Exercise, his Widow
or his Heirs have two years Pay. But notwithstanding all
their pain and labour, their Wages are so small, that they
are not able to maintain their Wives and Children. But in
regard they Marry very young in this Country, the Wives
as well of the Souldiers as of all the meaner sort of people,
take care to learn some Trade besides, that they may be
able to maintain their Families. The Captains also have
their work prepar'd for them. For they are oblig'd to look
after the King's Elephants, and to manage them for the
Wars, and so to breed them, that they may not be afraid of
Wild-fire, or any other Artificial Fires: as also to build
places all along the Rivers, for the Galleys to ride shelter'd
in, when they can no longer live out at Sea. All these Offi∣cers
and Captains, and Lords of the Court, which are gene∣rally
call'd <HI>Mandarins,</HI> have but four days in a Month to
divert themselves, two at the first change of the Moon, and
two at the full.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Manners and Customs of the People of
the Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>THe People of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are naturally mild and peace∣ful,
submitting easily to reason, and condemning
the Transports of Choler. They esteem the Ma∣nufactures
of strange Countries far beyond those of their
own; though they are not very curious of seeing any other
Countries but those where they were born; and where, as
they say, they always desire to live, to honour the Memory
of their Ancestors. They have a tone in speaking, natu∣rally
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
soft and pleasing; happy memories, and in their Lan∣guage,
which is very florid, they use several apposite Com∣parisons.
They have good Poets among them, and People
that love Learning; in which respect they are no way infe∣riour
to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquineses,</HI> as well Men as Women, are for the most
part well proportion'd, of an Olive Complexion, very
much admiring the whiteness of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Their Noses
and Faces are not so flat as those of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> as being
generally better made. Their Hair is very black, which
they usually wear as long as it will grow, being very care∣ful
in combing it. The Common People plait it in tresses;
and tie it like a great Roll upon the top of their Heads.
But the Nobility, Men of Law, and Souldiers, tie their
Locks about their Necks, that they may not flutter in their
Faces. They do not believe their Teeth to be handsom, till
they have made them as black as jet; and they suffer their
Nails to grow; the longest being accounted the fairest.</P>
<P>Their Habit is grave and modest, being a long Robe that
reaches down to their heels, much like that of the <HI>Japonneses,</HI>
without any distinction of Sex. This Habit is bound about
at the wast with a Girdle of Silk, interwoven with Gold
and Silver, the Workmanship whereof is alike on both
sides. As for the Souldiers, their upper Garments reach no
farther then their Knees; only their Breeches reach down to
the mid Leg, without either Hose or Shoes.</P>
<P>The vulger sort of People are altogether slaves for one
part of the year. For unless they be the Citizens of the
Capital City, where the King keeps his Court, all the other
Handicrafts of what Trade soever, as Joyners, Carpenters,
Locksmiths, Masons, and the like, are oblig'd every year to
work three Months at the King's Palace; and two Months;
or Moons more (For the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> reckon their Months by
the Moon) for the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or great Lords. The rest of
the year is for themselves, all which time they have liberty
to work for the support of their own Family. This Service
in their Language is call<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Viecquan,</HI> or the <HI>Condition of a
Slave.</HI> But they are liable to other drudgeries worse then
those before mention'd; as to lop Trees, with which they
chiefly feed their Elephants. This is a severe days work, to
which they were condemn'd by the great Grandfather of
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
the King that now reigns, after he had put an end to the
Civil Wars that turmoil'd his Kingdom, and that he had
brought his rebellious Subjects to submit themselves. They
had occasion'd him a great deal of trouble, and in regard
he could not subdue them without a great hazard of his
Army, his Council advis'd him to famish them; but he ra∣ther
chose to give them their Lives, and to condemn them
and their Posterity to this laborious Service, of which he
might in time reap the benefit.</P>
<P>I have told you elsewhere that the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> take great
delight to live upon the Rivers, which are there free from
Crocodiles and all other dangerous Animals, which haunt
the Waters of <HI>Nile</HI> and <HI>Ganges.</HI> Where we are to observe,
that these Rivers overflow their Banks every year, after the
Rains are fall'n, with that terrible violence, that many times
they carry away whole Towns and Villages, at what time
a good part of the Kingdom looks like a Sea, resembling
the lower <HI>Egypt</HI> under Water upon the Inundation of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Marriages of the Tunquineses, and their
severity toward Adulteresses.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Tunquineses</HI> cannot Marry without the consent
of the Father and Mother, or if they be dead, with∣out
the allowance of their nearest Kindred. They
must also have the permission of the Judge or Governour of
the place where the Marriage is to be made, for the obtain∣ing
of which they must give him some Present. But in regard
they were wont to exact upon the poor people more then
they were able to give them, so that many Marriages were
disappointed, to the great damage of the Public; the King,
who reign'd in the year 1639, being inform'd of these Extor∣tions,
and their ill Consequences, set forth a Law to regu∣late
those Abuses, and to curb the Authority of the Gover∣nours.
He order'd that the young Man who was desirous
to Marry, should pay no more then such a Sum, according
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
to the proportion of his Estate, amounting to one or two
fourths <HI>per Cent.</HI> and that they were not worth above a
hundred Crowns should pay nothing. Now in regard the
Common People, both Men and Women, are naturally
laborious, all that the Maids can get they preserve for their
Portions, and to buy them two or three handsom Garments,
with a Neck-lace of Coral or yellow Amber, and a certain
number of Beads, to garnish their Locks; which they suffer
to hang down upon their Backs, accounting the beauty of
their Hair to consist in the length.</P>
<P>There is no Wedding kept without a great Feast; and
they must be very poor when the Feast lasts not above three
days; for sometimes they junket for nine days together.
The next day after the Wedding the Bridgroom calls the
Bride his Sister, and she calls the Bridegroom Brother. The
Law of the Land permits the Man to divorce his wife when
he pleases, which they do many times for very slight causes.
But the Woman has not the same Priviledge: or at least, if
she desire a separation, it is much more difficult to obtain;
and the occasion must be very notorious. The <HI>Tunquineses</HI>
say that this Law was made to keep the Women in sub∣jection,
and to oblige them to be respectful to their Husbands.
When the Husband desires this separation, the Ceremony is
this. You must know that many of the Eastern People
never touch their Victuals with their hands, but make use
of two little sticks about six inches long, gilt and varnish'd,
which serve them instead of Forks. The Husband then,
when he goes about to repudiate his Wife, takes one of his
own sticks, and one of his Wife's, and having broken them,
they take each one half, and sow it up in a piece of Silk, in
which they keep it. Then the Man is bound to restore the
Woman what she brought with her, and to keep the Chil∣dren
which they had between them. But these Divorces
are not half so frequent as formerly.</P>
<P>The Laws are also very rigorous against Adulteresses. So
that if a woman accus'd of this crime be convicted thereof,
she is cast to an Elephant bred up to this purpose, who pre∣sently
throws her up into the Air with his Trunk, and when
she comes to the ground, tramples her under his feet, till he
can perceive no life in her.</P>
<P>While my Brother was at the Court at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> he was a
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
witness of the severe Punishment, to which a Princess was
condemn'd, for being taken in the Act with a certain Prince.
It is the Custom in the <HI>East,</HI> when a Prince dies, to shut up
in the most private and retir'd part of all his Palace all the
women which he made use of in his life time. There they
are allow'd two Maids to attend them, they eat alone, and
see no person living any more to the very day of their deaths.
I cannot tell by what means one of the Princes of the blood
had got a view of one of the deceased King his Uncle's
wives; but being desirous to see her again, and to overcome
all difficulties that oppos'd him, and to deceive the Guards
that watch'd the Dores, he made use of a slight not easily dis∣cover'd.
For you must know, that in the Kingdom <HI>Tunquin,</HI>
as in all the Kingdoms of <HI>Asia,</HI> in the Houses of the Kings
and other great Lords, the Kitchin is usually separated from
the House, and that the Garden is between them; so that for
the better carrying the Meat from one place to another, the
Servants make use of a kind of Flasket, or rather Iron
Chest. And to keep the Meat warm, the Dishes are sup∣ported
by little sticks laid athwart, about an inch distant
one from another, under which is an Iron Plate with holes
pierc'd quite through, about half a foot above another,
which makes the bottom of the Chest; between which
Plates they put lighted Coals, to keep the Meat warm.
These Chests being to be carri'd by two men, the <HI>Tunquinese</HI>
Prince plaid his game so well, that he was put into one of
these Chests wherein the Princesses Meat was wont to be
carri'd up into her Apartment. But he was not there many
days before the thing was discover'd. He was presently
brought before the King, who caus'd him to have several
weighty Chains to be put about his Neck and Wast, and
upon his Hands and Leggs; and thus chain'd and manacled,
he order'd him to be led about for five Months together,
to be seen by the People. After that he was shut up in a
close Prison, where he remain'd seven years, till the death
of the King, whose Son coming to the Throne, set him at
liberty, upon condition he should serve as a private Souldier
upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom. As for the Princess
she was shut up in a little Chamber upon the top of a
Tow'r, where she remain'd twelve days without having
any thing given her to eat or drink; after that the Chamber
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
was all uncover'd at the top, that the sun might come at
her, and scorch her to death, and so she di'd in three days.
The two Maids that serv'd her had a little more favour, for
they were thrown to the Elephants, who presently trod
them to death. The two Porters of the Chest, or Flasket,
were ti'd to four small Galleys, by the two Hands, and
two Leggs, and as they Row'd several ways were pre∣sently
dismembred. Being at <HI>Daca,</HI> in the Kingdom of
<HI>Bengala,</HI> I saw the same Justice done to a <HI>Bramerè,</HI> who
would have betraid <HI>Cha-Est-Can</HI> to the King of <HI>Arachan.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Visits, Feasts, and Pastimes of the
Tunquineses.</HEAD>
<P>AMong all the <HI>Eastern</HI> People the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> are the
most sociable, and most frequently visit one ano∣ther.
Generally they make their Visits about Noon,
in the hottest time of the day, and then every one walks
with a Train suitable to his Condition. The Princes and
<HI>Mandarines</HI> ride upon their Elephants, or else they are carri'd
in a kind of Litter, where they may either sit or lie. Six
Men carry it, and behind them follow six more to ease them
by times. Their Train consists generally of fifty or sixty
Persons; neither are they permitted to exceed that number.
As for the ordinary Gentry, and Officers of the Court, they
ride a Horse-back, not being allow'd above seven or eight
Servants to attend them. They chew, <HI>Betlè</HI> continually, as
all the other <HI>Asiaticks</HI> do in such places where it is to be had.
And when any one comes to visit another, it would be
taken for a great affront, if at his taking leave, he should
not be presented with a Box of <HI>Betlè,</HI> to take what he
pleas'd.</P>
<P>The richer that Box is, the more Honour is given to the
Person to whom the <HI>Betlè</HI> is presented: Insomuch that when
a Prince is about to be marri'd, he usually sends three of
these Boxes to his Spouse, of which I have seen some at
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
the Apartments of some of the Princes that came to the
Court of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> which were worth above 4 or
500000 <HI>Livres:</HI> One shall be cover'd with Diamonds, ano∣ther
with Rubies and Pearls, another with Emraulds and
Pearls, or else with other Jewels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquineses</HI> take it for a great dishonour to have their
Heads bare, which is only for Criminals, whom they cause
to be shav'd so soon as they are taken. So that it is a diffi∣cult
thing for a Criminal to escape the hands of Justice, for
wherever they go, when they find that a man has no Hair,
he is taken and carri'd to the Governour, who causes him to
be nail'd to a Cross immediately.</P>
<P>They sit cross legg'd, after the manner of the <HI>Asiatic</HI>
People. At great mens Houses, in the Halls, where they
receive their Visits, there is as it were an <HI>Alcove,</HI> with a kind
of a Bedsted rais'd about a foot from the ground. It is
cover'd with a very fine Mat, made of little Reeds bound
together, as it were with fine thread. For it is not the
Custom to spread Carpets upon the Floors, as in other
Countries of <HI>Asia.</HI> Not that the deerness hinders them from
making use of them, for these Mats cost them more then a
fine <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Carpet would do, but because they are
cooler to sit upon, and because the <HI>Punies</HI> do not get so easily
into them. Being at <HI>Bantam</HI> I bought one of these Mats of
a <HI>Tunquinese,</HI> which was admir'd for its fineness. It was nine
Ells square, and as even and as soft as Velvet. With these
Mats they cover the Beds or Couches, upon which the <HI>Man∣darins,</HI>
or <HI>Princes,</HI> and the Nobilty which accompany them,
seat themselves round the Chamber, every one having one
Cushion under him, and another at his Back.</P>
<P>As for their Diet the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> are not very curious. The
Common People are contented with Rice boil'd in water,
and dri'd Fish, or salted Eggs. For as for Flesh they eat
none but at their Festivals. The great Lords are serv'd every
day with Flesh and Fish, but their Cooks know not what
belongs to bak'd Meats. Otherwise they are more neat in
their Kitchins and Chambers then we, only they make no
use either of Napkins or Table-cloaths. Whatever is set
before them to eat, is serv'd in little Plates, not so big as
our Trenchers, being made of wood lacker'd with all sorts
of Flow'rs, like the Cabinets which are brought from <HI>Japan.</HI>
<PB REF="28"/>
<PB REF="29"/>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
All these Plates are brought up, rang'd in order, in a large
Voyder, lacker'd like the Plates. Usually the Voyder holds
ten or twelve Plates, and the Meat is cut in little pieces,
about the bigness of a Hazle Nut. They make use neither
of Spoons, nor Knives, nor Forks, but only of those little
Sticks, of which I have made mention in the foregoing
Chapter, never touching their Meat with their fingers.</P>
<P>When there are several sitting at the Table, either at their
ordinary Meals, or upon some Festival, they account it a
great piece of Manners to be silent; or if they have a desire
to Discourse, they alway allow the Eldest the honour of
beginning, bearing a great respect to them that are aged.
But the Youngest, at the Table, is never permitted to begin
the Discourse. They wash their Hands, their Mouths, and
Faces before they sit down, but never after Meals. And
when they desire to know whether every one has had his
fill, they ask him whether he have eaten his Rice, according
to the Custom of the Ancient Fathers in Scripture, who, by
Bread, meant the whole Repast. Neither is it a Custom
among them to ask one another how they do? but how
many Measures of Rice he eat for his Dinner, and whether
he eat with an Appetite. This is a general Custom among
all the Idolatrous <HI>Indians,</HI> unless in the Dominions of the
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> where they eat not Rice only, but Bread, and
there they ask in civility how much Rice they boil'd, and
how much Meal they bak'd for Bread; for the more he eats,
the better in health they think a man is.</P>
<P>Among all the Pastimes of the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> there are none
wherein they take so much delight as in Comedies, which
are only Acted in the Night-time; but those which are pre∣sented
the day that they first behold the new Moon are the
best. They last from Sun-setting to Sun-rising, and they
are set out with beautiful Decorations and Machines, very
pleasing to behold. They are excellently well skill'd in
representing the Sea and Rivers, and making a shew of Sea-fights,
and Combats between Galleys and Barks, though
they have seldom more then eight Actors, Men and Women.
The places appointed for these sights, are great Halls, the
third part whereof the Theater takes up, the rest being fill'd
with Benches for the Spectators. Upon each side of the
Theater is a Box very sumptuously set out, reserv'd for the
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
King when he pleases to come. The Actors and Actresses
are very magnificently clad. The dress for the Womens
heads being a kind of Miter or Diadem, which exceedingly
becomes them, from the hinder part whereof two Ribonds,
three fingers broad, hang down below their wasts. Both
the one and the other Act their parts very perfectly, and,
according to their manner, observe an exact time in their
Dancing.</P>
<P>At one of the corners of the Hall sit the two Judges of
the Comedy, one of whom beats time upon a Brass Drum.
Their other ordinary Pastimes, especially for the Lords and
<HI>Mandarins,</HI> are Fishing and Hunting, though they take
more pleasure in the former, by reason of the plenty of
Fish which their Rivers afford them. But, as I said before,
they follow these sports only upon the days that are permit∣ted
them, as being better husbands of their time then we, not
sparing any part of it from business. So that they who at the
beginning of that little knowledge which we had of these
People, wrote that their Manners and Customs were wild and
barbarous, were misinform'd. For as there is no reason to doubt
of the truth of what I affirm, and what others have confirm'd
by other Relations, we may well conculde from what I have
said, That all the Duties of Civil Society and Politeness are
not confin'd within our <HI>Europe;</HI> but that the Kingdom of <HI>Tun∣quin,</HI>
anciently a part of <HI>China,</HI> still retains the good Govern∣ment
and Civility of the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Learned Men in the Kingdom of
Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>CErtain it is, that the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> have a very great
inclination for Learning, and that they apply them∣selves
to their Studies with diligence and success:
for that they cannot be advanc'd without it to the Offices
and Dignities in the Kingdom. I do not here, by Learning,
mean the understanding of the Languages of our Learned
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
Men of <HI>Europe,</HI> which are altogether unknown to the
Eastern People, and much less the Philosophy of <HI>Aristotle,</HI>
of which they never so much as heard. But we mean the
knowledge of the Laws of their Country, by means
whereof they obtain the charges of Judicature; the <HI>Mathe∣maticks,</HI>
and particularly <HI>Astronomy,</HI> to which all the Ori∣entals
have a great inclination, as being great observers of
the Stars, by whose assistance they flatter themselves to be
able to foretel things to come. The <HI>Tunquineses</HI> are also passio∣nate
lovers of <HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> as being great admirers
of <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Tragedy,</HI> of which those two Sciences are
the main Composition; so that the Musicians and Actors
of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are accounted the best in the whole Eastern
part of the World.</P>
<P>That you may acquire Nobility by Learning, in your
Youth, you must pass through three degrees, of the <HI>Synde,</HI>
the <HI>Doucan,</HI> and the <HI>Tansi,</HI> from which degree you may
ascend to that of the Nobility.</P>
<P>To attain the first degree, it behoves the Youth of
<HI>Tunquin</HI> to apply themselves for eight years together to their
Studies, and that very close, to enable themselves for the
Office of a Notary, Proctor, and Advocate, to which
there is nothing more conducing then to speak Eloquently
in public. At the end of eight years, they are examin'd
concerning the duty of those Employments; and if any
one fail to give an Answer to the Questions propounded, he
is sent back again as incapable to obtain any Employment
for the future, or to study any longer. For those that
acquit themselves well of their Examination, which is
very rigorous, their Names are set down in a Register,
and presented to the King, who first grants them the liberty
to take upon them the Title of <HI>Synde,</HI> and then if it be
their aim to enjoy the Quality of <HI>Doucan,</HI> they are com∣manded
by the <HI>Tansi</HI>'s to study <HI>Music, Astrology,</HI> and <HI>Poesie,</HI>
not only to be able to be judge of it, but also to perform
themselves upon occasion. For to be good judges of <HI>Co∣medy,</HI>
which is a great Honour among them, it behoves
them to be both good Comedians and Musicians. Nor in∣deed
is there any Pastime more frequent then that of the
Theater in this Country; for there is never any solemn
Festival among them, which is not accompany'd and set
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
forth with Artificial Fire-works, in making whereof these
People are exquisite; after which they have their Come∣dies,
with Machines, and change of Scenes in every Act.
Besides this, their Actors have a prodigious memory, so
that let the part be never so long, they never make use of
Prompters to assist them, as we do in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They that will learn the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> must make their
own Instruments themselves, and spend five years in this
study. They are examin'd every year, and if they fail
to answer such Questions as are ask'd them, for the first
four they are pardon'd; but at the end of the five years,
if upon the grand Examination, they fail to answer the
Questions demanded them by the <HI>Tansis,</HI> they are utterly
degraded; whereas if they satisfie their Examinors, they
are permitted the Name and Dignity of <HI>Doucan.</HI> After
thirteen years thus spent, before they can arrive to
the degree of a <HI>Tansi,</HI> they must spend four years more in
learning to write and read the <HI>Chinese</HI> Character to such a
certain number of Words. For the life of a Man would
not suffice to learn to write and read the <HI>Chinese</HI> quite
through. The reason is, because that as to this particu∣lar,
it is not in <HI>China</HI> as in other Nations, where one Word
is compos'd of several Letters. The <HI>Chineses</HI> for every
Word have a different Figure, all which Figures are very
numerous, as you may easily conjecture. By the by let
me tell you, that these Figures are made with small Pen∣cils,
and that the <HI>Chineses</HI> make use of a certain Ink, which is
made up into a Paste, and so moisten'd in Water as you make
use of it. They have also another sort of Colour for certain
Words. But they cannot make use of Pens, as our <HI>Euro∣peans,</HI>
which are made of Quils; nor of those of other
Eastern People, which are made of small redish brown
Reeds, the best of which grow in certain Mershes in
the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Arachan.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Students of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> they are also
oblig'd to understand the Laws and Customs of the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
as well as their own; and the last four years being at an
end, the last and great Examination is made in the great
place, within the Enclosure of the Palace of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> which
is a stately Marble structure. There the King is present,
with the Princes and great Lords of the Court, the <HI>Mande∣rins</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
for Learning, and all the <HI>Tansis;</HI> and many also
come on purpose from distant Provinces to the Solemnity.
Some Relations of <HI>Tunquin</HI> have been a little too ridiculous
in this particular, asserting extravagantly; that some∣times
there are above 30 or 40000 Students present at
these Examinations; but by what I could learn from my
Brother, or gather by that discourse which I have had
with the Natives, the number of Students never exceeds
three thousand. There are in the place nine Scaffolds set
up; of which the one is for the King and Princes, the other
for the Examiners, and those that are to be Examin'd: And
for the better hearing what is said, the Scaffolds are built
like an Amphitheater. But whereas there are eight days
spent in this Examination, the King and the <HI>Mandarins</HI> are
never there but only the two first days. The last day all
the Names of them who have been Examin'd, as well they
who have answer'd well, as of them that have falter'd,
are left in the Hands of the sixteen chief <HI>Manderins,</HI> who
are as it were sixteen Counsellors of State, and then it is
at the King's pleasure to favour whom he thinks fit, of
those who have not given full satisfaction to the Questions
propounded to them. As for those who were found very
ignorant, they are degraded with shame, and there is no
more said of them. All those Names are usually written
upon large Tables, set up at the Gate of the King's Palace
for eight days together, to the end, that all the People may
know who are receiv'd into the Rank of <HI>Nobility,</HI> and
who not.</P>
<P>The eight days being pass'd, they are all to appear again
upon the same Scaffolds, where in the view of all the
World, they who have had the misfortune to have falter'd
in their Examinations, are dismiss'd as unworthy of any
Employment: while they who have behav'd themselves
worthy of approbation, are honour'd with a Vest of Vio∣let
Satin, which they presently put on, and then take upon
them the Name of <HI>Tansi's.</HI> Then they have given them a
List of the Towns and Villages, where they are to receive the
Rents which the King allows them; wherein however they
have not an equal share; some being allow'd more, some less,
according to their merit, or the favour of the Prince.
Presently they send notice to the places assign'd them of the
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
time, at which they intend to be there: and then all the
Inhabitants come forth to meet them, in Honour of their
Dignity, with all sorts of Music, and a Guilded <HI>Branquar,</HI>
carried by eight Men. There they are permitted to stay
three Months to divertize themselves, and for their own
recreation. After that they return to Court, to instruct
themselves in the affairs of the Kingdom, and the King's
House, and to perfect themselves in the knowledge of those
things, which is the way to obtain the Dignity of a <HI>Man∣darin.</HI>
All Embassadours who are sent to the Princes ad∣joyning,
especially to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> are chosen out of these
<HI>Tansi's,</HI> among whom they always make choice of the
ablest, and not of the richest, the King allowing them
sufficient to maintain their Port, and defray the expences
of the Embassy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Physicians, and the Diseases of the

<P>THe Physicians belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI>
do not make it their business much to study Books;
spending their Youth in searching after the nature
and qualities of the Roots and Simples, and how to apply
them according to the nature of the Distemper. But more
particularly they apply themselves to the beating of the
Pulse, and its diversity of Measure, by which they chiefly
pretend to understand the cause of the Disease, and what
Remedy to make use of for cure. And therefore when
they go to feel a Pulse, they feel it in several parts of the
Body; and according to the diversity of the part, and the
beating, they judge of the quality of the Distemper.
Therefore upon their first coming, they feel the Patient in
three places, first upon their right sides, and secondly upon
their left. By the Pulse which they feel upon the wrist of
the right hand, they guess of the condition of the Lungs;
by that which they feel upon the Vein of the Arms, where
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
generally People are let Blood, they guess at the Distem∣pers
of the Stomach, and the Region of the Kidneys.
The Pulse of the left Wrist discovers to them the condition
of the Heart: By that in the Veins of the left Arm, where
usually they let Blood, they are inform'd of the estate
of the Liver. By the Pulses of the Temples, both right
and left, they give a more exquisite judgment of the Kid∣neys.
They are very careful to count how many times a
Pulse of a sick Person beats in the time of one Respiration;
and according to these several Pulses, they tell you which
part of the Body is particularly distemper'd, whether the
Heart; the Liver, or the Lungs; or whether the Distem∣per
proceed from any outward cause, as from Cold, Sadness,
or any other disorderly Passion.</P>
<P>They never make use of any other Remedies but of
Herbs and Roots, which they choose themselves; there
being no distinction among them of <HI>Apothecary</HI> and <HI>Physician.</HI>
These Herbs they mingle sometimes with a little Ginger,
which they boyl in Water, and give the Decoction, being
strain'd, to the Patient. They have very good Receipts
for the Purples, Epilepsie, and several other Diseases
which are accounted incurable in <HI>Europe.</HI> They make use
of <HI>China</HI> Ink to stop a Dysentery, and for the cure of Wounds.
When the Sea Ebbs from the shoar upon these Coasts, they
find upon the Sand a little small kind of Crabs, which dye
immediately, and by the heat of the Sun, which is there
extraordinary, become as hard as a Stone in a short time;
these the <HI>Tunquinese</HI> Physicians beat to Powder, and give
to their Patients in Dysenteries, and Feavers, sometimes in
<HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> sometimes in plain Water. They mightily ad∣mire
the Herb <HI>Tea,</HI> which comes from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan;</HI>
which latter Country produces the best. It is brought to
them in Tin Pots close stop'd, to keep out the Air. When
they would use it, they boyl a quantity of Water, accor∣ding
to the proportion they intend to use, and when the
Water seeths, throw a small quantity into it, allowing as
much as they can nip between their Thumb and fore Finger
to a Glass. This they prescribe to be drank as hot as they
can endure it, as being an excellent Remedy against the
Headach, for the Gravel, and for those that are subject to
the Griping of the Guts; but then they order a little Ginger
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
to be put into the Water when it boyls. At <HI>Goa, Batavia,</HI>
and in all the <HI>Indian</HI> Factories, there are none of the <HI>Euro∣peans</HI>
who do not spend above four or five Leaves a day; and
they are careful to preserve the boyl'd Leaf for an Evening
Sallad, with Sugar, Vinegar, and Oyl. That is accounted
the best <HI>Tea</HI> which colours the Water greenest; but that
which makes the Water look Red, is little accounted of.
In <HI>Japan.</HI> The King and great Lords, who drink <HI>Tea,</HI> drink
only the Flower, which is much more wholsom, and of a
tast much more pleasing. But the Price is much different;
for one of our ordinary Beer Glasses is there worth a <HI>French</HI>
Crown.</P>
<P>The most dangeroug Distempers that befall the <HI>Tunqui∣neses,</HI>
most usually happen when the bad Air surprizes
the People; for of a sudden it deprives them of their
Speech, and then Death suddenly follows without a speedy
Remedy. The best Remedy for this sudden Distemper is
to mix some Counterpoison with <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> instead of Wine,
and to let the Patient drink it as hot as he can. The Patient
also, must at the same time be rub'd with a Cloth dip'd in
<HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> where Ginger has been boyl'd. This takes
away the pains caus'd by cold Winds, and unwholsom Airs.
Though some for the more speedy cure of these pains, lay
the Patient upon a Bed made only of Girts, four Fingers
distant one from the other; and then setting a Chasing-dish
underneath, cause the sick Person to sweat in a Cloud of
Frankincense, till the pain is gone, repeating the same
thing Morning and Evening.</P>
<P>As for Blood-letting, it is by no means us'd in that Coun∣try.
They make use of Fire, especially for the Purple-Feaver,
a Disease so dangerous in <HI>France.</HI> For the cure of
this, the Physitians of <HI>Tunquin</HI> take the Pith of a Reed,
which they dry very well; dip it in Oyl, and set it on Fire:
and then apply to every Purple Spot one of these lighted
Wicks. The Spot will give a whif like a small Squib,
and that's an infallible sign that the Venom is gone out of
the body. This Remedy is seldom apply'd but in the
night time, because the Spot does not appear so well in
the day time. And the Physician must be very careful,
that when this Venom flies out of the Patient's Body, it does
not find a way into his own; for then there is no Remedy
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
but Death. There are some Physicians that will prick the
Purple Spot with a Needle, and let out the Pestilential
Blood; after which they burn the part so prick'd, and then
rub it with Ginger, not permitting their Patient to take
the Air in 20 days after they are cur'd. While they are
under cure, they drink nothing but Water, with Citron∣peel
boyl'd in it, and abstain from Flesh and Butter. They
give them to eat Rice boyl'd in Water, and salt Fish; but
the more they abstain from eating and drinking, the sooner
they are cur'd. And indeed it is a wonderful thing to see
the excellent effects of their Remedies in so short a time;
for they have no lingring Distempers to hold them years
together, as they do among us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Original, Government, and Policy, of
the Kingdom of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not above six hundred years since <HI>Tunquin</HI> was first
govern'd by particular Kings, in regard it was anciently
a part of the Dominion of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> What is re∣ported
of the first <HI>Tunquineses,</HI> That they were without
Governours, and without Kings, is altogether fabulous,
like to that which is related of a certain Infant of three
years of Age, who appearing before a great Assembly of
the People, exhorted them to free themselves from the
power of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who were their Oppressors. Upon
which a lovely Horse miraculously appearing to the said
infant, he mounted the Horse, and immediately setting for∣ward
with those that were gather'd after him, as also others
that appear'd as wonderfully to assist him, he set upon the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> and defeated them in such manner, that they never
durst venture after that to return any more to reconquer
what they had lost. But the most certain truth of <HI>Tun∣quin</HI>
History assures us, That for these six Centuries last past,
it has been govern'd by six various Families. The first that
assum'd the Title of King was a famous Robber, whose
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
Name was <HI>Din,</HI> who having gather'd together a great
Number of Malecontents, and Vagabonds, became so
powerful and formidable through his own Valour, that
after several bloody Battels gain'd, it was no difficult thing
for him to seize upon the Throne. But he did not reign
long in peace, for the most part of the People rebell'd
against him; and in the first Battel that he fought, he lost
his Life. However his own Party won the day; and
having left two Sons, his eldest reigned three years; after
whose death, the younger Brother rul'd in his stead, but
dy'd soon after, neither of the Brothers leaving any issue
behind them. After that the Kingdom was miserably
distracted by several Civil Wars, till the weaker Party
calling in the <HI>Chineses</HI> to their Assistance, became the most
puissant. Then it was that a certain <HI>Mandarin,</HI> of the
Family of <HI>Lelequel,</HI> was advanc'd to the Throne, who
being a valiant and prudent Prince, restor'd tranquillity to
the whole Kingdom. Who, when he saw himself Establish'd
in peace, built that large Palace, which they, who have
seen it, admire, as well for it's Circuit, as for its magnificent
Structure, being all of Marble of divers Colours, both
within and without. This King had but one Daughter,
who soon after her Father's death, the better to secure her
self, marry'd one of the most powerful <HI>Mandarins</HI> in the
Country, of the House of <HI>Tran.</HI> But soon after, one of
her Subjects rebelling against her, gave her battel, took
her Prisoner, and put her to death. Having thus got the
Power into his hands, the Rebel usurp'd the Throne; but
nine years after, he was also slain in Battel by his own
Subjects, who had call'd the <HI>Chineses</HI> to their Assistance.
They being thus Masters of the Kingdom, held it for twenty
years, and set Governours over every Province. But at
length the <HI>Mandarins</HI> grew weary of their Oppression, because
of the heavy Tributes which they laid upon the <HI>Tunquineses;</HI>
so that a valiant Captain of the House of <HI>Le,</HI> having assembled
a numerous Power together, gave the <HI>Chineses</HI> three Battels,
and in every one overcame them. The <HI>Chineses</HI> thus expell'd
out of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> the Conquerour seiz'd the Crown, and in
his Family the Regal Government continu'd for above four∣score
years. After which time, a great Lord, of the
Family of <HI>Marr,</HI> which had formerly enjoy'd the Scepter,
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
to Revenge himself of an affront which the King had
put upon him at Court, found a way to escape his hands,
and being assisted by a great Number of discontented Per∣sons,
of which the best regulated Kingdoms are always
full, and the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who always sought an opportunity
to regain what they had lost, after a bloody Battel, he
possess'd himself of the Kingdom, it being never known
what became of his Predecessor. But this new King en∣joy'd
the Fruits of his Victory but a small while. For two
years afterwards, a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> of the House of <HI>Trin,</HI>
having espous'd the Daughter of another great Lord, openly
declar'd War against his Soveraign, with a design utterly to
extirpate the House of <HI>Marr.</HI> Unhappily for him, death put
a stop to his designs, though he left two Sons behind him,
able enough to have pursu'd his undertakings. But the
eldest, naturally timorous, and fearing to engage himself
in a dangerous War, voluntarily submitted himself to the
King, who gave him the Government of a Province, and
marry'd him to one of his Sister's Daughters. The younger
Brother being a valiant Prince, and having his deceased
Father's Army at his Devotion, though the King propos'd
him great advantages, would give ear to nothing, but out of
his ambition to Reign himself continu'd and successfully ac∣complish'd
what his Father had begun. In the second
Battel which he gave the King, who was there in person,
he took him Prisoner, together with his Brother, who had
submitted to him, and some few days after he put them both
publicly to death at the head of his Army; the one as an
unjust usurper of the Throne; the ether as a desertor, who
had abandon'd his Father's Army, and so ill follow'd his
intentions.</P>
<P>Now though as Victor he might easily have ascended the
Throne, and tak'n upon him the Name and Title of King,
yet he would not accept of any higher Title then that of
General of the Army; and the better to Establish himself
in his Authority, and to gain the affection of the People,
he caus'd Proclamation to be made through all the Provinces
of the Kingdom, that if there were any Prince of the House
of <HI>Le</HI> yet remaining alive, he should shew himself, with
full assurance that upon his appearing, he should be put into
possession of the Kingdom. There was but one to be found,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
who had been so closely pursu'd by the House or <HI>Marr,</HI>
while it rul'd, that to save his Life he was forc'd to abscond
himself in the Frontiers of the Kingdom, under the Habit
of a private Soldier. The General was overjoy'd to find
that there was yet a lawful Heir of the House of <HI>Le</HI> to be
found, that he might place him upon the Throne. So that
so soon as he was known to be of the Legitimate Race, all
the Equipage and Attendance of a King was sent to him,
with Order to all the Provinces as he pass'd along, to receive
him as if he were already crown'd. The whole Army
march'd two days march to meet the King, and brought
him to <HI>Checo,</HI> the capital City of the Kingdom, where he
was plac'd in the Throne of his Father, and with great
Pomp proclaim'd King of <HI>Tunquin.</HI> But General <HI>Trin,</HI> who
car'd not so much for the Royal Title, as the Royal Power,
so order'd his business, that leaving to <HI>Le</HI> all the outward
shew and Pomp of Royal Authority, he reserv'd to himself
the whole command of the Army, and the greatest part of
the Revenues of the Kingdom absolutely to dispose of at
his own pleasure. So that from that time to this hour, we
may affirm that there has been, and still are, two Kings of
<HI>Tunquin,</HI> of which the first has only the Name and Title of
King, and is call'd <HI>Boüa,</HI> and the second <HI>Choüa,</HI> who has
all the Authority, disposing of all things at his pleasure,
while the other remains shut up in his Palace like a Slave,
not permitted to stir abroad but upon certain days: and
then he is carry'd through the Streets of <HI>Checo,</HI> like an Image,
though with a magnificent Train and Royal Equipage. He
has generally 2000 Soldiers for his Guard; and sometimes
20000 which are quarter'd upon the Frontiers, chiefly to∣ward
<HI>Cochinchina.</HI> He also has ready upon the Frontiers 50
Elephants for War. And upon the Rivers of the Kingdom
where the Enemy can come to damage him, he usually
keeps 100 great Galleys, with a vast company of small
Galliots, to which the Soldiers and Rowers that belong,
have more pay then the others at Land. And these, that
they may row with more strength, row standing, with
their Faces toward the Prow, quite contrary to our Row∣ers,
who turn their backs.</P>
<P>The King gives public Audience almost every day; but
he makes no Edict, or public Decree, that is of any effect,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
if it be not also Sign'd by the <HI>Choüa.</HI> At these Audiences
he has with him thirty two Councellors of State, and besides
these, a hundred others to judge of all Appeals of the
Kingdom. The Eunuchs have a very great Power at Court,
as in all other Courts of <HI>Asia,</HI> and the King, as to his most
important affairs, confides more in them then in his own
Children. The eldest Children do not always succeed
their Father; for the <HI>Choüa,</HI> or General, with all the Coun∣cellors,
which are generally his Creatures, thought it con∣venient,
that when the King should have more Sons then
one, he should make choice of whom he pleas'd to succeed
him. So that so soon as he has nam'd him, the <HI>Choüa,</HI>
attended by the principal Officers of the Army, Councellors
of State, and Eunuchs, come to congratulate him, and
to give him their Oaths to set him upon the Throne after
the death of his Father; and for the other Brothers they
are always shut up in the Palace, as in a Prison, without
medling with any affairs of State. They never stir out of
the Palace but four times a year, and they never stay
abroad above six days at a time, the Officers that attend them
being put upon them by the <HI>Choüa,</HI> who is as it were Lord
high Constable of the Kingdom. The first of these six
days of liberty they go to visit the Temples, and the Priests,
to whom they give large Alms; the two next days they
take their pleasure in hunting; and the three last days they
spend their time upon the Rivers, in Galleys sumptuously
trimm'd and adorn'd.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin</HI> is divided into eight large Pro∣vinces,
every one of which has its Governour, and its Ma∣gistrates,
from whose sentence there lies an Appeal to the
Court. We should wrong this Country to say that there
were no Nobility therein; as indeed there are none in most
Kingdoms of <HI>Asia.</HI> But they must all attain to this degree
their merit; some by the Warrs, and some by their Learning.
They who attain their Nobility by Arms, have wherewithall
to live handsomly at home; and they begin to learn their
Exercises betimes, at farthest by eleven or twelve years of
Age. The first thing they are to understand, is how to
handle their Swords; the Blades of which are streight,
long, and broad, like those of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> having but
one Edge. They are also taught to aim with their Bows,
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
and to fire a Musket with Matches, (for they know not
the use of Fire-Locks) to ride the great Horse, to shoot
running, and to manage their <HI>Zagay's,</HI> which are a sort
of Staves, cheek'd with Iron, like a Half-Pike. When
they are ready in all these Exercises, then they learn to
make all sorts of Artificial Fire-works; as also how to in∣vent
new ones, to make use of them against the Elephants. By
the way I must needs tell you, there are some of these Ele∣phants
as I have seen several times, that are so accustom'd
to these Artificial Fires, that they regard them not at all,
neither are any way disturb'd at the Squibs that are thrown,
and go off under their very Noses and Bellies. Neverthe∣less
of 200 of these Creatures which the Eastern Kings
carry to their Wars at a time, you shall have hardly fifteen
that are so hardy and valiant. So that unless their Gover∣nours
take not great care, instead of running upon the
Enemy, they turn upon their Friends, and put the whole
Army into a most dismal confusion; as you shall hear by
the following Story. For <HI>Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> the present
<HI>Great Mogul,</HI> being then a young Prince, obtain'd of
<HI>Cha-gehan,</HI> his Father, to let him have the command of
an Army of threescore thousand Men, and fourscore Ele∣phants;
and with this force, out of his Antipathy to the
Christians, he laid Siege to <HI>Daman,</HI> a Town belonging to
the <HI>Portugals,</HI> fourteen Leagues from <HI>Surat.</HI> The Gover∣nour
was a person of great Valour, and had also two Sons
with him, who, together with himself, had both serv'd
the King of <HI>France.</HI> He had also in the Town eight hun∣dred
Gentlemen, who voluntarily put themselves into the
Garrison for its defence, from all parts of <HI>India</HI> where the
<HI>Portugueses</HI> had to do, and were all excellently well mounted.
For the <HI>Portugals</HI> at that time made use of none but <HI>Arabian</HI>
Horses, the worst of which cost a thousand Crowns at least.
The Governour finding that the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince began to press
hard upon him, having already made two Assaults, resolv'd
with all his Cavalry and Infantry to make a Salley upon <HI>Sun∣day</HI>
Morning, causing them to fix at the ends of their Spears
and Lances certain Artificial Fire-works, to which they were
order'd suddenly to give fire, as soon as they should gain
the Elephants Quarter. This design was so successful, that
when it came to be executed, the Elephants were so suddenly
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
terrifi'd, that running impetuously through the <HI>Indian</HI> Army,
they trod to the ground, and cut in pieces with the Swords
and Scithes which were fasten'd to their Trunks, what ever
stood in their way. The <HI>Portugals</HI> taking advantage of this
confusion, made no less havock among the amazed Multi∣tude,
whom they had surpriz'd securely and profoundly
asleep. For they had an opinion, that the <HI>Portugals</HI> would
never attack them upon the Sabboth day, believing they
had the same veneration for that day which the <HI>Jews</HI> had.
But they were utterly deceiv'd, in so much that the <HI>Portu∣gals,</HI>
by virtue of this Stratagem so closely pursu'd, obtain'd
a notable Victory, to the utter destruction of 20000 of
<HI>Aurenge-Zebe</HI>'s Army, the spoils whereof are reported to
have amounted to above twelve Millions.</P>
<P>But to return to the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> I must tell you,
that the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> have often wag'd War against the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
because the first would not pay the latter the Tribute which
was accorded them by a Treaty made by one of their Kings,
of the House of <HI>Le.</HI> But in the year 1667, the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
seeing that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made themselves Masters of their
Country, made a Peace with the <HI>Tunquineses,</HI> wherein it
was agreed, that the said Tribute should be no longer paid;
but that they should every year send an Embassador only to
<HI>Pequin,</HI> to do homage to the Emperour of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>As for their Justice and Policy, they observe a very exact
Order and Regulation over all the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> as
well in their Cities, as in the Country. So that few of the
best regulated Kingdoms exceed them. More especially
they have a great care, for the public good, to repair the
Bridges and High-ways; and every quarter of a League
there is such Provision made, that any Traveller may there
meet not only with Water, but Fire also to light his Pipe,
being generally great smoakers of Tobacco.</P>
<P>As for Murder, they are very exact in punishing that
crime. For they carry the Person apprehended before
the Judge; and then he must hold to his Mouth a little wisp
of Grass, to shew, that by his disorderly life he had made
himself a Beast. Not much unlike this is the custom in
<HI>Persia,</HI> where the King and his Council condemn or pardon
all but such as have murder'd a Man that has any Kindred.
For then all the favour that the King can shew him is, to
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
deliver him into the hands of the next of kin to the Person
kill'd, who has power to agree with the Criminal for a Sum
of Money, which is rarely done, as being accounted an
Act both infamous and ignominious. So that if there be
no agreement made, then it behoves the next of kin to be
the Executioner himself, and put the Criminal to that death
to which he is before condemn'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Court of the Kings of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough the King, as I have already said, have
not much Authority in his Kingdom, which is
govern'd altogether by the General, who has the
whole <HI>Militia</HI> at his Devotion, yet he is highly honour'd by
his Subjects, and he keeps a very splendid Court. The
first and fifteenth day of every Month, all the <HI>Mandarins</HI>
who are the Grandees of the Kingdom, are bound to come
in their <HI>Chinese</HI> Habits to kiss the King's hands. The Con∣stable,
or General, was formerly wont to perform the
same Office, but by degrees he has obtain'd a dispensation,
and only sends another Prince in his stead. As for all the
other <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Governours of Provinces, Justiciaries,
and Military Officers, every year they go to kiss the <HI>Choüa</HI>'s
hands, and to congratulate him upon the first day of the
year, which is the fifteenth of the fifth Month; as also when
he has obtain'd any great Victory over his Enemies. So
that the General has more Honour done him then the King
himself. 'Tis also the custom of the <HI>Tunquineses,</HI> among
the Men, that when they meet any Person higher in condi∣tion
then themselves, they make four profound obeysances
to the very Earth. But for the Women, what ever their
condition be among themselves, they never make but one.
They who are desirous to be admitted into the Palace to see
the King, are oblig'd to put on Violet Robes, and their
Servants must be clad in the same colour. They that ap∣proach
the King's presence to obtain any favour, must
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
carry a Present along with him. For though the Constable
be the person that disposes of all Offices and Commands
over all the Court and Kingdom, yet every year upon the
fifteenth day of the seventh Month, the King distributes
several considerable Gifts and Largesses to his Courtiers; as
also to the Children of such Fathers who have perform'd
any important Service for the good of his Kingdom. He
gives them Pains of Gold, every one worth six hundred
<HI>Livres;</HI> and Bars of Silver, amounting each to forty six
<HI>Livres.</HI> The same day he also releases all Prisoners, both
Criminal and Debtors, provided the crime do not deserve
death; and that the debt do not exceed two Bars of Silver.
Also every year, the three last days of the last Month, the
40 <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who are the chief Councellors of State, take
the Oaths of all the Lords and Officers of the Court, and of
their Wives; causing them to swear to be faithful to the
King, and if they know of any thing that concerns the
King's person, or his Kingdom, to discover it. All Go∣vernours
of Provinces give the same Oaths to the Lords and
Gentlemen under their Jurisdictions; and the Governours
of Cities to the Citizens, and other Inhabitants. They
that discover any Treason never fail of any reward; only
with this distinction, in reference to the quality of the Per∣sons
that reveal it. For as for the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Gentle∣men,
the King rewards them according to his own plea∣sure:
But as for the meaner sort, whether Men or Women,
they are ennobl'd, and gratifi'd with a reward of 50 Pains
of Gold, and 500 Bars of Silver, which in all amounts to
53000 <HI>Livres.</HI> But they esteem their Nobility far beyond
their Money.</P>
<P>At certain times of the year, there is a Muster of the
Youth of the several Provinces; and all those who are
found not to be either of the Nobility, or not to have learnt
any Trade, are presently enroll'd for the Service of the
King, who every five years make choice of such as he in∣tends
for his Guard, and sends them to the Frontier Garri∣sons.
There are some who endeavour to get off by Money;
but if they be discover'd, both the Officers and the Soldier
are punish'd without redemption. For they hang a little
Bell about his Neck, Fetter his Arms, and in that posture
send him to the Constable, who presently orders his Head
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
to be struck off. But in regard the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> are very averse
from seeing any Blood shed, the Kindred or Friends of the
condemn'd Person, intercede that he may be hang'd, be∣lieving
that death to be most honourable which is not defil'd
with Blood-shed; wherein they seem to be of the Opinion
of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Ceremonies observ'd when the Kings of
Tunquin are advanc'd to the Throne.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we speak of the Enthroning the Kings of
<HI>Tunquin,</HI> and of the Ceremonies that attend it, it
behoves us to relate the manner of their setting out
of the Palace, when they go at any time to take their plea∣sure.
The King is seated upon a most magnificent <HI>Palan∣quin,</HI>
carry'd by eight Men, where he may be beheld by
all the People; the Lords and Officers of the Court attend∣ing
him on foot, provided he do not go out of the City:
for when he goes into the Country he rides upon an Ele∣phant,
and the Lords follow him on Horse-back. When
the Queen Mother, or his first Wife go abroad, they are
likewise carry'd upon a close <HI>Palanquin,</HI> with Lattice-Win∣dows,
to the end, they may see and not be seen; and
behind the <HI>Palanquin</HI> follow the Maids of Honour on foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and great Princes, solemnize their Birth∣days
every year, with great Feasting, Pastimes, Come∣dies,
and Fire-works, and all their Friends and Kindred
fail not to attend them to honour the Solemnities. In the
year 1645, the eldest Son of the King, who was by his
Father appointed for his Successor, upon one of his Birth∣days
shew'd the Court all the divertizements he could
imagin, and the King who had a great affection for him,
sent him a thousand Pains of Gold, and five hundred Bars
of Silver, to the value of 120000 <HI>Livres.</HI> At which
time, large Alms are distributed, especially to poor Widows
and Prisoners.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="38"/>
When the King dies, and leaves several Sons, they set up
him whom (when alive) he chose for his Successor. The
third day after the Decease of the King, the Constable with
all the Military <HI>Mandarins,</HI> the Lords of the Council, and
all the Governours of Provinces, repair to the Prince's Ap∣partment,
where they present him with a <HI>Chinese</HI> Habit, af∣ter
which having mounted him upon an Elephant, they
bring him into one of the great Courts of his Palace, which
is all covered with Cloth of Gold and Silver as with a Tent.
There it is, that being placed upon a Throne magnifi∣cently
enrich'd, all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> prostrate themselves up∣on
the Earth with their Heads downward; in which po∣sture
having lain for some time, they rise, and closing their
Hands together, with their Arms and Eyes lifted up to Hea∣ven,
they swear to the new King to be faithful to him till
death. This first Ceremony being over, the new King, to
shew himself liberal upon his first coming to the Crown,
causes four Panes of Gold, and six Bars of Silver, to be gi∣ven
to every one. But to distinguish the Constable from
the rest, he gives him twenty Panes of Gold, and forty Bars
of Silver: and to the President of the Council or Chancel∣lour
ten of Gold and twenty of Silver. These Presents be∣ing
thus made, several Pieces of Artillery are fired round
the Palace, accompanied with several Volleys of small
Shot, there being then in Arms above 30000 Horse and
Foot; and then the King is set upon a magnificent <HI>Palan∣quin,</HI>
and the Constable and chief of the Council ride before
upon lovely Horses. Sixteen of the principal Officers of the
Court carry the King, <HI>viz.</HI> eight Military <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and
eight of the Council. And in this manner they set forward
to the Apartment of the deceased King, from whence all
the Lords retire for two hours, except the Eunuchs; and
then it is, that the Princesses, Ladies of the Court, and chief
Wives of the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> come to kiss the King's Hand, and
congratulate his Advancement to the Throne. Which
done, all the Lords return again to a noble Feast after the
manner of the Countrey ready prepar'd. Their Viands are
not so delicate, nor so deliciously dress'd as ours, neither
have they so much variety. 'Tis true, they have those
<HI>Birds-nests,</HI> already mention'd, which they mix in the most
part of their Dishes, which gives the Meat a tast of
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>
almost all sorts of Spices. Of all the Meats which they eat
Colts Flesh is in most esteem, and Dogs Flesh, neither of
which agree with our Palates. The Festival is concluded
with Comedies and Fireworks, which la allst the night.
The next day the 30000 Men that gave their Volleys of
small Shot the day before, are drawn up in good order in a
Field next, and all the principal Officers of War, Colonels,
Captains, and Lieutenants, leave the Frontiers to be at the
same place. Then the King mounted upon his <HI>Palanquin,</HI>
and carried by sixteen of his principal Officers, the Consta∣ble
and grand Squire riding before, and attended by several
other Commanders on foot, with several Mummers that
play and dance before the <HI>Pallanquin,</HI> goes forth of his Pa∣lace,
the Drums, Trumpets, Cornets, and other Warlike In∣struments,
filling the Air with their Martial Sounds. In
this Pomp, and with this Equipage, the King being come
to the Camp, quits his <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and mounts one of his
great Elephants of War, which are us'd to the noise of the
Guns and sight of the Fireworks. Being thus mounted, he
rides into the middle of all his Troops, in which place all
the Officers swear Fidelity to him; after which he bestows
his Gifts upon them, to every Colonel two Panes of Gold,
and forty Bars of Silver; to every Captain the half of what
he gives a Colonel, and to every Lieutenant the half of what
he gives a Captain: and as for the Souldiers, they have
every one a Moneths Pay. These Presents being made, the
whole Army discharges three Volleys, and then every Com∣pany
retreats into a large Hutt, where they have Meat and
Drink prepar'd for them, enough to serve them a whole
day and a night. In the same Field is also set up a fair woo∣den
Palace, sumptuously enriched within with Paintings
and several pieces of Workmanship in Gold. There the
King spends all the night, some part in Feasting, some part
in Plays and seeing the Mummers dance, and the rest in be∣holding
the Fireworks. The next day the King leaves his
wooden Palace, which is afterwards fir'd by the Souldiers,
as well as their own Hutts, and so returns to the City. Be∣ing
arrived at his Palace with the same pomp that he went
forth, he seats himself upon his Throne, and there shews his
Liberality to those that made the Fireworks, to the Come∣dians
and Dancers, and all the rest that were any way con∣tributory
<PB N="43" REF="39"/>
to the setting forth the Pomp of the Ceremony.
Then he gives Access to all the People, and two Commissi∣oners,
one for the Merchants, and the other for the Handi∣crafts,
make a Speech to the King, the substance whereof is;
that all the Burgesses and Inhabitants of the good City of
<HI>Checo</HI> do acknowledge him for their King, and that they will
be faithful to him till death. The Speech being ended, the
King presents the Body of the Merchants with 50 Panes of
Gold, and 300 Bars of Silver; and the Body of the Trades∣men
with 20 Panes of Gold, and 100 Bars of Silver. The
People gone home, every one strives who shall spend most
in Feasting and Comedies, adding of their own to the Kings
Bounty; so that every Quarter of the City is full of Jollity
and Rejoycing for a week together. Some days after come
the Commissioners for the Commonalty, from all parts of
the Kingdom, who in the behalf of their Cities and Towns
make known to His Majesty the universal Joy of the People
for their lawful Prince, assuring him of their Fidelity, and of
their Service against the <HI>Chineses.</HI> They name particularly
the <HI>Chineses,</HI> because the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> have no greater Ene∣mies
then they, and for that the Hatred between them is ir∣reconcileable.
The King observing the good will of his Peo∣ple,
testifies his Acknowledgment in this manner: All
that have not time out of mind been Rebels to their lawful
Sovereigns, but have constantly taken up Arms for their
Defence, are discharged for a year from all Taxes and Im∣positions;
and for the rest, who have at any time formerly
assisted the Enemy, they are onely exempted for six moneths.
All Prisoners for Debt partake also of the King's Bounty, so
that after the President of the Council has made a Compo∣sition
with the Creditors for half the Summe, the King pays
the rest.</P>
<P>It is a thing almost incredible, what a vast number of Sa∣crifices
the King sends to the Temples of his false Gods, to
be there offer'd to the Idols.</P>
<P>The number of Beasts is said to exceed an hundred thou∣sand,
besides the value of a million in Panes of Gold, Tissues,
and Silks, to adorn the Idols, and Orange-coloured Calicuts
for the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and those that attend the Service of the <HI>Pa∣gods.</HI>
Among the rest of these Presents he sends a vast num∣ber
of Pieces of blue Calicuts for the poor people that are
<PB N="44" REF="40"/>
kept in the <HI>Pagods,</HI> as our Poor are kept in Hospitals. The
Idolatrous Princes also consume incredible Summes to adorn
the <HI>Pagods</HI> and Images of their false Gods. There are some
of them three foot high, all of massy Gold; others of Silver
bigger than the Life.</P>
<P>The new King after all these Ceremonies are over, takes
his time to go and give thanks to his false Deities for his co∣ming
to the Crown when the Moon first changes, shutting
himself up for the first week with the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and living in
common with them with a great deal of Frugality.</P>
<P>During this time he visits the principal Hospitals, to see
how the poor people are us'd, especially the old Folks,
whom they have in great Veneration, to whom he distri∣butes
new Alms; for naturally the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> are very
charitable. To conclude, he makes choice of some fair
Situation, where he orders the building of a new <HI>Pagod,</HI>
which he devotes to some of his Idols. Thus his Devotion
being ended, upon the first day of the second Quarter, he
mounts one of his Elephants of War, attended by all the
Officers of his Court on Horse-back, and ten or twelve
thousand men on foot, chosen out of the whole Army to
attend him. All the second Quarter the whole Court says
in a certain Plain, where are three Houses set up, one for
the King, one for the Constable, and one for the President
of the Council; with a world of Huts for the rest. There
are also several small Cabins set up, which are not covered
and closed but upon one side, which they turn as the Wind
blows; and these are the places where they dress their Vi∣ctuals:
For at that time the King allows two meals a
day to all his Attendants.</P>
<P>Through this Plain runs the River of—which
is very broad in that place. Upon this River are several
Galleys richly gilded and painted, but especially the Ad∣miral,
which exceeds all the rest in Maginificence. The
Prow, the Poop, the Ropes, the Oars, but onely that part
which goes into the water, glitter all with Gold; the Ben∣ches
very ingeniously painte the Rowers well clad. For
there the Rowers are all Souldiers and Freemen, contrary
to the Custom in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Souldiers in their youth are
taught to handle their Oars, and have somewhat better Pay
than the Land-Souldiers. The Galleys are not so big as
<PB N="45" REF="40"/>
ours, but they are longer, and cut the water better. While
the King stays in this place, he diverts himself with seeing
these Galleys row one against another. In the Evening the
Rowers come ashoar with their Captains to kiss the King's
Hand, and they that have behav'd themselves most stoutly
and nimbly, carry off the Marks of his Bounty. The seven
days being past, the King calls before him all the Souldiers
of the Galleys with their Officers, and gives them two
moneths Wages extraordinary, as he does to his Land-Souldiers.
'Tis a wonderful thing to behold the vast num∣ber
of Fireworks which they throw about, as well upon the
Land as upon the Water. For my Brother, who has been
present at all these Shews, has told me, that for these seven
days together you would think the Air and Water all on fire.
Being at <HI>Bantam</HI> I once saw one of these artificial Firework-Shews
which the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> that were there plaid off before
the King, and I must confess it was quite another thing from
what we make in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The seven days being past, the King returns to the City in
the same order, and with the same pomp, as he went
forth; and being come to his Palace, he goes directly to
the Apartment of his Princesses, where none but his Eu∣nuchs
accompany him, where he stays all the rest of the
moneth. Every Evening he diverts himself with new Fire-works,
which are plaid off before the Womens Lodgings;
where also the Eunuchs, together with the Comedians and
Mummers, contribute to divertise the Ladies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Funeral Pomp of the Kings of Tunquin, and
of their manner of Burying their Dead.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the King of <HI>Tunquin</HI> dies, he is presently
Embalm'd and laid in a Bed of State, where
for sixty five days the People have liberty to
come and see him. All that time he is serv'd as he was
when he was alive; and when the Meat is taken from be∣fore
the Body, one half is given to the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> and the other
half to the Poor. So soon as the King hath breath'd his
last gasp, the Constable gives notice thereof to the Go∣vernours
of Provinces, and orders them how long they shall
Mourn.</P>
<P>All the Military <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Judges wear Mourning
generally three years, the King's Houshold nine moneths,
the Nobility six, and the meaner sort three moneths. Du∣ring
these three years there is a Cessation from all Diver∣tisements,
except those that attend the Ceremony of the
King's Advance or Elevation to the Throne. All the Vi∣ands
which are serv'd up to the King are vernish'd with
Black. The King cuts his Hair, and covers his Head with
a Bonnet of Straw, as do likewise all the Princes and Coun∣sellors
of State; neither do they leave off that Habit till the
King's Body be in the Galley which is to carry him to his
Enterment. Three Bells which hang in one of the Tow∣ers
of the Palace, never leave tolling from the King's ex∣piring
till the Corps be put into the Galley. The third day
after his Decease all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> repair to Court, to testi∣fie
their sorrow which they have for the Death of the de∣ceased
King, and ten days after that the People are allow∣ed
to see the Body lie in State, till it be put into the
Galley.</P>
<P>During the sixty five days that the Body is thus expos'd,
the Constable is busie in preparing for the Funeral Pomp.
From the Palace to the place where the Galleys wait for
the Body, it is about two days Journey, and all the way</P>

<HEAD>The Order observ'd in the March of the Fu∣neral
Pomp at the Interment of the
Kings of Tunquin.</HEAD>
<P>1. Two Messengers of the Chamber proclaim the deceased King's
Name; each of them bears a Mace, the Head whereof is full of
combustible stuff for Artificial Fire or Fusées.</P>
<P>2. Next proceed Twelve Elephants; on each of the four fore∣most
is one bearing the King's Standard. Then follow four other
Elephants, with Wooden Turrets on their Backs, and in every one of
these are Six Men, some being armed with Musquets, others with
Fire Lances. The four last Elephants do severally carry a kind of
Cage; some of which are on all sides shut up with Glass Windows,
the other with a sort of Grates; the first being of a Square, the other
having six sides and facing.</P>
<P>3. Then rides the Master of the Horse, attended with two Pages
on Horse-back.</P>
<P>4. Twelve Horses are led by the Bridle two and two, by as
many Captains of the Guard. The Harness of the first Six Horses
is very rich, the Bit, and all the Furniture of the Bridle and Saddle
are of pure Gold, the Saddles are embroydered likewise with Gold:
But the Six other Horses Harness is all cover'd over with Gold
Plates.</P>
<P>5. The Chariot which bears the <HI>Mausolee,</HI> wherein is the
King's Corps, is dragged by Eight Stags trained to this Service.
Each of these Stags is led by a Captain of the Life Guard.</P>
<P>6. Then follows the new King afoot clad in White Satten, with
a Straw Cap on his Head. If he hath any Brothers, they attend
on him in the like Attire; and they are surrounded with Musicians
and Players on the <HI>Hoboys,</HI> and other Instruments.</P>
<P>7. There proceeds afterwards Six Princesses in White Satten,
who carry Meat and Drink for the deceased King. These are at∣tended
<PB REF="42"/>
by two Ladies of Honour in Purple Garments; and about
these Ladies are several Musicians.</P>
<P>8. Eight Princes of the Royal Bloud go in Purple Garments
with Straw Hats.</P>
<P>9. Four Governours of the four chief Provinces of the King∣dom,
each bearing a Stick on his Shoulder, on which hangs a Bag full
of Gold and several Perfumes; and these Bags contain the Presents
which the several Provinces make unto the deceased King, for to be
buried with his Corps, that he may make use of the same in the other
World.</P>
<P>10. Two Chariots go next, each drawn by Eight Horses, and
every Couple being led by Two Men. In each Chariot is a Coffer or
Trunk full of Bars of Gold and other Riches, for the deceased King's
use in the Life to come.</P>
<P>11. A great Crowd of the King's Officers, and of the Nobility,
do follow this Funeral Pomp, some afoot and some on horse-back, ac∣cording

<HEAD>A Continuation of the Order observed at
the Funeral Pomp of the Kings of Tunquin,
setting out from the City of Bodlego.</HEAD>
<P>The King's Body is put into a Galley, which is drawn up the Ri∣ver.
This River is increased by several Brooks that come down
from the Mountains, and it runs through barren and Desart Coun∣tries.
In some of these places they are wont to bury the Corps very
privately; for six onely of the chief Eunuchs of the Court are to know
where the King hath been buried. An Oath is tendered to them ne∣ver
to reveal the place. And this is done perhaps on some Religious
Motive, and likewise through Fear, that the Treasures which are
buried by him should be digged up. These Riches are ordinarily some
Massy Bars of Gold and Silver, as likewise some Pieces of Cloth of
Gold and Silver, and such kinds of other rich Furnitures, which he is
to make use of (as they say) when he hath need of them in the other
World. Many Lords and Ladies of the Court will needs be buried
Alive with him, for to serve him in the places where he is to go. I
have observed in passing through the Estates of the <HI>Raja</HI> or Prince of
<HI>Velouche,</HI> which border on the Easterly parts of the Kingdom of
<HI>Visapour,</HI> that the Wives suffer themselves to be buried Alive near
their deceased Husbands, instead of being burned, as they practise in
other Provinces of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

spread with Violet-colour'd Calicut, which is the King's
Colour. But in regard the King and all the Court march
afoot both going and coming, they make it seventeen days
Journey. At every quarter of a Leagues end are set up
Huts, where is ready prepar'd Water to drink, and Fire to
light their Tobacco. After the Pomp is over, and that the
King is returned home, the Cloth is taken up and given to
the <HI>Bonzes.</HI></P>
<P>As to the order of their March it is thus:</P>
<P>The two men that go formost of all, are the two Ushers
of the Door of the King's Chamber, who go repeating
aloud the Name of the deceased King, carrying each of
them a Mace of Arms, the bole whereof is full of artificial
Fireworks. The twelve that follow, are the twelve chief
Officers of the Galley, which draw the Tomb whereon the
King's Name is written. Then follows the grand Squire on
Horseback, attended by two others. Next appear twelve
led Horses, which are led two by two, six of which have
their Bridles enrich'd with thin Plates of Gold, and their
Saddles embroydered. The other six with Bridles of Gold,
and Housses embroidered, and fring'd about with a Gold and
Silver Fringe; every Horse being led by two men. Next
to them follow twelve Elephants, four which carry each of
them a man carrying a Standard; four others which carry
each of them a Tower with six men apiece, some with Mus∣quets,
others with Fire Lances; the four last carry each of
them a kind of a Cage, of which one is made with Glass
Windows before and upon each side; the other like a kind
of a Lattice, and the other with four kinds of Ruffs: and
these are the King's Elephants which he rode upon when he
went to the Wars. Behind them follow eight Horses, eve∣ry
one of them led by a Captain of the Guard, who draw
the Herse. The new King, and his Brothers if he have
any, or the Princes of the Bloud, follow the Herse, clad in
Robes of White Satten, which is their Mourning Colour.
Lastly follow two Chariots, each one drawn by eight Hor∣ses,
and carrying two Coffers, wherein are the Panes of
Gold, Bars of Silver, rich Tissues and Habits, which are to
be buried with the Body of the deceased King.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>The Funerals of the Tunquineses.</HEAD>
<P>AS fer the ordinary Funerals of the <HI>Tunquineses,</HI> they are
more or less pompous, according to the Quality of
the Persons.</P>
<P>At their Enterments they use great store of artificial Fire∣works,
which are the Companions as well of their Sorrow
as their Joy. They set upon the Tomb of the deceased
good store of Victuals and Comfitures, out of a belief that
the dead are the better for them. For their Priests keep
them in that blind Error for their own advantage, and so
well order their business, that there is nothing left by morn∣ing.
The same thing is practised by the <HI>Chineses</HI> at <HI>Bata∣via,</HI>
where they have a place without the Town to bury
their dead, which puts me in mind of this Story: Every
evening the Guard is relieved as well in the City as in the
Fortress. At the same time also they put forth eight Souldi∣ers
and a Corporal at each Gate of the City, who go the
Rounds about the Walls of the City, and as far as within Ca∣non-shot
of the Walls, being fearful of being surprised by
the King of <HI>Mataran,</HI> or <HI>Bontam,</HI> their Capital Enemies.
Now because the <HI>Chineses</HI> burying place lay in the Walk of
these Souldiers, when they saw the Provant upon one of the
Tombs, took it away to their Guard, and there feasted them∣selves.
The <HI>Chinese</HI> Priests, that usually came about mid∣night
to take away the Victuals, finding themselves several
times bereaved of their Expectations, and suspecting the
Souldiers belonging to the <HI>Holland</HI> Garrison, first complain∣ed
to the General and Council; but that not taking effect,
they resolved to poison both the Meat and the Drink, to
prevent the like Fraud for the future. This took so good
effect, that afterwards many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Souldiers being
poisoned, deterr'd the rest from any more such Licorish At∣tempts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion and Superstition of the
Tunquineses</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Tunquineses</HI> as to matters of Religion are divided
into three Sects: The first takes its original from
an ancient Philosopher called <HI>Confutius,</HI> whose Me∣mory
is very famous over all <HI>China,</HI> and the neighbouring
Countries. Their Doctrine asserts that Man is compos'd
of two parts, the one fine and subtil, the other material and
gross; and that when Man dies, the subtiler part goes into
the Air, and the grosser part stays in the Earth. This Sect
maintains the use of Sacrifices, and adores the seven Planets.
But among all their Gods and Idols they have four in parti∣cular
veneration; the Names of these Gods are <HI>Rauma, Be∣tolo,
Ramonu,</HI> and <HI>Brama.</HI> They have a Goddess also, whose
Name is <HI>Satisbana,</HI> which is she whom the Women adore;
but for the King and the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> especially the more stu∣dious
sort, they adore the Heavens. The second Sect had
for its Founder a certain Hermite called <HI>Chacabout,</HI> and is
followed by the most part of the meaner people. He has
taught them the Transmigration of Souls, and has enjoyn'd
his Followers to observe 10 Commandments.</P>
<P>The first is, That they shall not kill. 2. That they shall
not steal. 3. That they shall not defile their Bodies-
4. That they shall not lye. 5. That they shall not be un∣faithful
in their words. 6. That they shall restrain their in∣ordinate
Desires. 7. That they shall do injury to no man.
8. That they shall not be great Talkers. 9. That they shall
not give way to their Anger. 10. That they shall labour
to their utmost to get Knowledge.</P>
<P>As for them that design to live a Religious Life, they must
renounce the Delights of this Life, be charitable to the poor,
overcome their Passions, and give themselves up to Medita∣tion.
He taught moreover, that after this Life there were
ten distinct places of Joy and Torment: and that the Con∣temners
of this Law should feel Torments proportionable
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>
to their Offences, without any end of their Torments. That
they that endeavour'd to fulfill his Law, and had fail'd in
any point, they should wander in divers Bodies for 3000
years before they entered into happiness. But that they
who had perfectly obeyed his Law, should be rewarded
without suffering any change of Body. And that he himself
had been born ten times, before he enjoyed the Bliss which
he possessed, not having in his first Youth been illuminated
with that Knowledge which he afterwards attained. This
<HI>Chacabout</HI> was one of the greatest Impostors that ever was in
<HI>Asia,</HI> having spread his Opinions over all the Kingdom of
<HI>Siam,</HI> over a great part of the Provinces of <HI>Japon,</HI> and from
thence into <HI>Tunquin,</HI> where he died.</P>
<P>The third Sect is that of <HI>Lanthu,</HI> to whose Fables the <HI>Ja∣ponneses</HI>
and <HI>Chineses</HI> give great credence, but the <HI>Tunquineses</HI>
more. He was a <HI>Chinese</HI> by Nation, and one of the great∣est
Magicians in the East. He made a great many Disciples,
who to authorize this black Impostor, and the more to im∣pose
upon the people, made them believe that the Birth of
<HI>Lanthu</HI> was miraculous, and that his Mother carried him in
her Womb, without losing her Virginity, seventy years.
He taught much of <HI>Chacabout</HI>'s Doctrine; but that which
won the Hearts of the people was, that he still exhorted the
Grandees to build Hospitals in all Cities where there had
been none before. Insomuch that several of the Nobility
betook themselves to those places to look after the Sick, as
did also a great number of the <HI>Bonzes</HI> for the same reason.
While my Brother was there, the <HI>Choüa,</HI> a great Enemy to
these Vagabonds, sent for a great number of <HI>Bonzes</HI> and
<HI>Says,</HI> or idle Fellows, and picking out the strongest and
best proportion'd, sent them away to the Frontiers for Soul∣diers.</P>
<P>'Tis the Custom of the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> to adore three things
in their Houses: The first is the Hearth of their Chimney
made of three Stones The second is an Idol which they
call <HI>Tiensa,</HI> which is the Patroness of Handicrafts, as Sculp∣ture,
Painting, Goldsmith's work, &amp;c. So that when they
put forth a Child to learn any of those Trades, before they
let him work they set up an Altar, and sacrifice to this Idol,
to the end he may infuse into the Lad wit and aptness to
learn. The third is the Idol <HI>Buabin,</HI> which they implore

when they design to build an House. For then they erect
an Altar, and send for the <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says</HI> to sacrifice to
this Idol. To this purpose they make great preparation of
all sorts of Viands, and then present him with several gilt
Papers, wherein are written several Magic words, endea∣vouring
by that means that he may not suffer any misfortune
to befall the House they are going to build.</P>
<P>There are some <HI>Tunquineses</HI> that adore the Heaven, others
the Moon, and others the Stars. There are also some that
adore five parts of the Earth, making a fifth part in the
middle of that which is known to us, and to them also, but
confusedly. When they worship them, they have for each
of the parts a particular Colour. When they adore the
Northern part, they clothe themselves in black; and the
Dishes and Table whereon they lay their Sacrifices are like∣wise
black. When they worship the South their Habit is
red; when the East, green; when the West, white; and
when they adore the middle of the World, they wear
Yellow.</P>
<P>They offer Offerings likewise to Trees, Elephants, Horses,
Cows, and almost to all other sorts of Animals. They that stu∣dy
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters are accustomed every fifth moneth
of the year, to sacrifice for the Souls of the dead who were
never buried. They believe that by so doing their Under∣standings
shall be more enlightned for the apprehending of
all things.</P>
<P>Every year, at the beginning of the year, they have a
great Solemnity, to honour after their death those who in
their life-time have done any noble action, and were re∣nowned
for their Valour, reckoning in that number those
that have been so hardy as to rebel against their Princes, as
being men of Courage. Three days before this great So∣lemnity,
which is perform'd in a large Field, they set up
several Altars, some for the Sacrifices, others for the Names
of the Illustrious Men whom they design to honour. The Eve
before above 40000 Souldiers spend the night in this Plain,
where all the Princes and <HI>Mandarins</HI> are ordered to meet
with their Elephants and led Horses, and the King himself
goes thither in person. After they have finished all their
Sacrifices, and burnt good store of Incense to the Honour of
the dead, the King and all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> make three pro∣found
<PB N="52" REF="48"/>
Reverences where the Altars are; then the King
shoots with his Bow and Arrows five times against the Al∣tars,
where lie the Names of those that were so rash as to
rebel against their Sovereigns. After that the great Guns
go off, and the Souldiers give three Volleys of small Shot,
to put all the Souls to flight. Then they burn all the Al∣tars,
and a great number of gilt Papers, which were made
use of at the Sacrifices; concluding all with a most hideous
shout of all the Souldiery. Which done, the <HI>Bonzes, Says,</HI>
and such like people, come and devour the Meat that was
made use of for the Sacrifices.</P>
<P>The first and fifteenth days of the Moneth 'tis a wonder∣ful
thing to hear the Chiming Din of their great Bells. For
those are the more especial Holydays set apart for the Wor∣ship
of their Gods, and all the <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says</HI> give them
more than ordinary Worship upon those days, redoubling
their Prayers, and repeating upon those days every one of
them a strange kind of Charm six times over. At these
times several people bring Meat and Drink to the Sepul∣chres
of their Kindred, to sacrifice for the good of their Souls
to eat. The <HI>Bonzes</HI> fail not to be there, and when the
others have paid their Devoirs the <HI>Bonzes</HI> fall to, and what
they cannot eat they give to the poor. But for all the au∣stere
Lives of these <HI>Bonzes</HI> and <HI>Says,</HI> neither the King nor
the <HI>Mandarins</HI> make any account of them, so that they are in
credit onely with the common people.</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> where the great Cities have
several <HI>Pagods,</HI> there is hardly a Town or Village that has
not one, and for every <HI>Pagod</HI> at least two <HI>Bonzes</HI> and two
<HI>Says.</HI> But there are some <HI>Pagods</HI> that maintain forty <HI>Bonzes</HI>
and as many <HI>Says,</HI> who live in common under a Superiour,
they keep to the Doctrine of <HI>Chacabout,</HI> and a Goat is the Idol
which they adore. They wear about their Necks a kind of
Necklace, consisting of 100 Beads, very big and made of
Wood. In their Hands they carry a Staff, which is headed
with a Bird of varnish'd Wood. They beg for their living,
and are not like the <HI>Bonzes</HI> in other Kingdoms, who beg
Alms as it were their due; these on the contrary use all the
modesty and humility that may be, never taking more than
is needful for them: and if they have any thing to spare,
they give it to the poor Widows or Orphans that cannot get

their living. Their Orders permit them to marry, provi∣ded
they leave their Monastery. They assist at the Funerals
of great men, where they say a kind of Orizon, sounding
their Trumpets and Cornets, while the Bells in their <HI>Pagods</HI>
go at the same time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tunquineses</HI> also have a great veneration for two
Magicians, and one Magicianess. The first of their Magi∣cians,
whom they call <HI>Tay-bou,</HI> makes them believe that he
knows the Events of things to come; so that when they
have any occasion to marry their Children, build a House,
buy Land, or undertake any business of Consequence, they
consult this Oracle to know what shall happen to them.
The Magician courteously receives them, and with a coun∣terfeit
modesty demands of them (for Example) the Age of
the person concerned. Then taking into his hands a great
Book about three fingers thick, wherein are the Figures of
Men, half Men, and several sorts of Land and Water Ani∣mals,
of Circles, Triangles, and Squares, he goes to work,
and at the same time puts into a Goblet three Pieces of Cop∣per,
whereon are engraven several Characters onely up∣on
one side. After he has shaken the Pieces in the Cup,
he throws them upon the ground as at Cross and Pile; if
all the Characters lie undermost he looks no further in his
Book, but looks upon it as an unfortunate sign; but if one
or two Characters come up, he looks in his Book, and
makes the person believe what he pleases. But if all the
Characters happen to turn uppermost, then the Magician
cries out, that the Party is the most fortunate in the world.</P>
<P>The second Magician is called <HI>Thay-Phou-Thouy,</HI> to whom
they have recourse in all their Sicknesses. When any sick
person comes to him, he takes a Book full of Figures like
the former; onely the Form of the Book is different, for
this is not above an inch thick, and about four fingers long,
with eight Panes full of Cyphers. If after several Apish
tricks which he acts before the sick person to amuse him, he
affirms that the Distemper comes from the Devil, he him∣self,
together with the sick party and they that brought him,
do Homage to the evil spirit: this Homage consists of se∣veral
Sacrifices, and the Friends of the sick party present to
the Devil, or rather to the Magician, a Table furnish'd with
Rice and other Viands. But if after all these Offerings the
<PB N="54" REF="51"/>
sick party do not recover his health, all the Friends and
Kindred of the sick party, with as many Souldiers as they
can get, surround the sick persons House, and shoot off their
Musquets three times, to drive away the Devil. Some∣times
the Magician makes the sick party and his Friends be∣lieve,
that the God of the Waters is the cause of the Distem∣per,
especially if the sick person belongs to the Water, as
being a Mariner, Boatman, or Fisherman. And to the end
he may be cur'd, and that the appeas'd God may return to
his watry Habitation, he orders that all the way from the
sick parties House to the next River may be spread with all
the Pieces of Stuff which all the Kindred have, and that
they set up Huts at such and such distances, and keep in eve∣ry
one a several Table furnish'd with all sorts of Viands for 3
days. And all this to oblige the Deity to retire, and to en∣tertain
him till he gets home. But the better to know the
rise of the Disease, <HI>Thay-Phou-Thouy</HI> makes them believe,
that they must go and consult <HI>Thay-Bou,</HI> who is the chief
Magician, and if he answer that the Souls of the dead have
caused the Distemper, the Magician imploys all his tricks
and devices to draw to him those mischievous Souls; and
when he has got into his Clutches, as he pretends, the Soul
that is the Author of the Disease, he shuts him up in a Bottle
full of Water till the party be cured; and then breaking the
Bottle he sets the Soul at liberty to go about his business.
When the party recovers, he makes him and his Friends be∣lieve,
that if the Bottle had not been well stopp'd to keep in
the Soul, their Kinsman would have died infallibly.</P>
<P>The Magicianess, which the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> also consult, is
called <HI>Bacoti,</HI> and she keeps a great Correspondence with
the Devil, to whom, if she has a Daughter, she offers her as
soon as she is born, the more to oblige him. If any Mo∣ther
bewail the death of her Child, and be desirous to know
in what condition the Soul of the Child is in, in the other
world, she goes to <HI>Bacoti,</HI> who to satisfie the Mother pre∣sently
falls a beating her Drum, to summon the Soul to come
to her, who presently appears, as she pretends, and tells her
its Condition whether good or bad. But most commonly
she makes the silly Mothers believe that the Soul is happy,
and bids them be of good cheer.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="51"/>
The Superstitions of these people are very numerous, but
the most remarkable are these:</P>
<P>The studious sort of people are very diligent to learn, how
by looking in a Mirrour to foretell things to come.</P>
<P>There are some that present <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> to the dead, and
sprinkle their Ashes with it; but this onely upon the Ashes
of their Ancestors, from whom at the same time they beg
for Health; Honour, and Riches.</P>
<P>Others there are, that upon the first day of their year take
a piece of Chalk, and make several Figures round, square,
and triangular, upon the Threshold and Steps of their
Doors. They say those Figures fright away the evil spirits.
Some there are that make great Observations upon the Feet
of their Hens, and draw strange Conclusions of bad or ill
fortune from thence. Others travelling into the Countrey,
if they sneeze but once by the way, return to the place from
whence they parted in the morning, saying, That had they
gone on, some mischief would have certainly befallen them:
but if they sneeze twice, they pursue their Journey, never fear∣ing
any danger for that day.</P>
<P>There are some so superstitious, that going out of their
Houses, if they meet a Woman, they return home again for
two or three hours; but if they meet a Man, 'tis a good
<HI>Omen.</HI></P>
<P>The first Fruit which they gather at the beginning of the
year, is that which the <HI>Araguer</HI> bears, spoken of in the third
Chapter. And this is the first which they eat with great
Ceremony, during the first Quarter of their second Moneth.
To which purpose they are so possess'd with the Devil, that
they poyson one of these Fruits, and give it to a Child to eat,
believing that by taking away the life of the poor innocent
Child, they shall thrive the better all the year after.</P>
<P>When the Moon is eclipsed, they say there is a certain
Dragon that assails her, and endeavours with all his might
to overcome her, with an intention to devour her. Then
to assist the Moon, and to put the Dragon to flight, they
discharge their Musquets, ring their Bells, beat up their
Drums, and make a hideous noise till the Eclipse be over:
and then they believe that they have rescued the Moon, for
which they make as great a rejoycing, as if they had ob∣tain'd
some eminent Victory over their Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="52"/>
They are also very superstitious in reference to the hours
of the day. They divide the natural day into twelve hours,
and to every one they give the name of some Beast, as of a
Tiger, a Lion, a Bear, a Horse, a Dragon, an Ape, &amp;c. The
Moneths also and Days have their particular Names: and
when a Child is born, presently the Father and Kindred go
to see the name of the Beast by which the Hour was call'd
wherein the Child was born; believing that Animal will
prove fatal to it. At the time that my Brother was at the
Court at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> the King then reigning being born in the
hour of the Horse, would never give Audience, nor ever stir
out of his Palace at that hour, for fear some mischief should
befall him at that time. That Prince was so superstitious,
that one of his Children dying in the fifth moneth, which
bears the name of the Horse, he would never permit him to
be enterr'd, but caus'd him to be burnt, and scatter'd his ashes
in the Air.</P>
<P>This is that which I could gather of most remarkable and
most considerable matters concerning the State of the King∣dom
of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> either out of the Manuscripts which my
Brother (who died in the <HI>Indies</HI>) left me, or from the Dis∣course
which I have had with the <HI>Tunquineses</HI> themselves both
at <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF THE
ISLAND
OF
FORMOSA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Hollanders possessed themselves of it,
and how it was taken from them by the
Chineses.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Island of <HI>Formosa</HI> is about Eighty
Leagues in compass; so that the <HI>Holland∣ers</HI>
were never in possession of the whole
Island, but were onely Masters of four
Fortresses, and two and fifty Villages,
wherein they could number about four∣teen
or fifteen thousand Inhabitants. As
for that part which is under the <HI>Indians,</HI> the best discovery
that we can give, is onely such as was made by a young
<HI>Hollander</HI> upon this occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="53"/>
There was in the chief Fort belonging to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a
young man, imployed there as an under-Factor, who being
wild and extravagant, was put out of his place and made a
Souldier. He not able to undergo that miserable course of
life, resolved with himself rather to die, than live in that
mean condition. Thereupon having at several opportuni∣ties
made a shift to make up a little Pack of what he thought
was most fit for the Mountainiers of the Island, he watch'd
his time and stole out of the Fort, and took his way directly
toward the Mountains. With these Highlanders he liv'd
four years, in which time having learnt the Trade and Lan∣guage
of the Countrey, he ventur'd to return to the <HI>Holland∣ers</HI>
again, who received him kindly, as being willing to
understand the Government of the People, and by what
means they might traffick with them. Whereupon the young
man made them this Relation.</P>
<P>As for the Government of the People he said, that over
every six Villages there was an Overseer with four Counsel∣lors,
who administer Justice, and punish the smallest Theft
with Death. The Men are crucified; the Women are laid
along upon a thick Beam of Wood, and then with a Scimi∣tar
their Bodies are divided into three parts. The Men are
so punish'd for Theft or Murder, and the Women for Theft
or Adultery. If it be a Pety Larceny, not above the value
of a Shilling, they give them an hundred Lashes with a
Whip, and burn them in the Cheek. They that believe
themselves to be unjustly dealt with, whether in Civil or
Criminal Causes, enter their Appeal to go to the North East
part of the Island, in which division of the Island there stands
a City by the Sea-side, where he that commands all the
Highlanders resides. At the end of our Moneth of <HI>March</HI>
several of these Highlanders resort to this City, especially
the Merchants, who carry along with them all their whole
Stock that they had hoarded together the year before in
Horns of Oxen, Harts, Bufulo's, and Raw Hides; and then
return again at the end of <HI>April,</HI> bringing back in return of
their Commodities <HI>Japon</HI> and <HI>China</HI> Stuffs, Clothes, and
Linen of the same Countrey, and Gold and Silver <HI>Japonese</HI>
Money, of various Coyns and Value. He told them also,
that he believed that in the Mountains near the Sea, there
are certain Mines of Gold and Silver, or some River where
<PB N="59" REF="53"/>
they find it in Powder, and that the <HI>Japoneses</HI> fetch it in their
Vessels. He did all he could to discover the truth, but after
he had travelled two or three days Journey, the People
would let him go no further. For at the end of every three
or four hours travel there are Guards set, who examine all
Travellers whither they go; neither will they let their own
Countrymen pass, but such as go about their Law or to trade.
Moreover he told them, that if they would give him Goods
to trade withall, as Amber, Coral, Looking Glasses; but
chiefly some Skins of the Sea Fish, which is rougher than
Seal-skin, he would endeavour to get to the very City it self
where the Ships ride. These Skins are greatly esteemed by
the Natives to adorn the Scabbards of their
Cutlasses and Swords. For usually upon the
back of this Fish you shall find nine little
Stones, which make a kind of a Rose, eight
in a Circle and one in the middle, as you
see these nine disposed in their exact order.
When the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> traded onely to <HI>Japon,</HI>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
it is incredible how dear they sold these Skins. For if Na∣ture
had well set these Stones at an equal distance, and even
in bigness, one of these Skins would yield above ten thou∣sand
<HI>Piasters,</HI> and more. This Fish is caught in the <HI>Persian</HI>
Gulph, where I have seen of them, but I saw but very few
so perfect as that which I have describ'd, which would in
those Countries yield ten thousand Crowns.</P>
<P>But to return to the Story; the Governour gave the
young man what he desired, and sent him going: but the
<HI>Chineses</HI> soon after expelling the <HI>Hollanders</HI> out of the Island,
it was never known what became of the young man.</P>
<P>It may be wondered why <HI>Formosa</HI> was taken so soon:
but here were two Reasons, first the faint-heartedness of the
Governour, and secondly his breach of word to a <HI>French</HI>
Souldier of <HI>Rouen,</HI> call'd <HI>Abraham du Puys;</HI> for he having
served out his time of seven years, desir'd leave to be gone,
but the Governour, after he had promis'd him fair at first, at
length absolutely refused him. Soon after the <HI>Chineses</HI> came
to besiege the place. The Souldier thus disappointed, and
seeing himself coop'd up who might have been free, had the
Governour so pleased, studied a fatal revenge upon all his
Countrymen; for being by this means grown desperate,
<PB N="60" REF="54"/>
watch'd his opportunity, and flinging himself from the Fort
into the Sea, swam directly to the Enemy. The Gover∣nour
offered 200 Pieces of Eight to any person that would
venture after him, and bring him back dead or alive. A
Serjeant accepted his offer, but it was to get loose as the
other had done; and so they got both safe into the Enemies
Quarters. The <HI>Chineses</HI> presently carried them to the Ge∣neral
<HI>Coxima;</HI> and he being a person of Valour and Discre∣tion,
made very much of them, whereupon they readily
and willingly inform'd him of the strength and condition of
the Fortress. They also advised him to remove his Batte∣ries
to the weakest part of the Town, whereas he was then
assailing it where it was most strongly fortified: which if
he would do, they assur'd him he should be soon Master of
the Fort. The General was thinking a little before they
came to have raised his Siege, but upon their encouragement
he fell on again according to their direction; and as he was
preparing for a general Assault, the <HI>Holland</HI> Commander,
fearful of losing his Life and his Estate, beat a Parley, and
surrender'd the place upon Articles.</P>
<P>During the Siege the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a Salley, but were
beaten in again, and fourteen of their men were taken Pri∣soners.
The <HI>Chineses</HI> finding those fourteen men in their
power, and remembering how cruel the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had been
to their Nation when they took any of them at Sea, brought
the fourteen men all together, put out one eye of each, cut
off their Noses, Ears, and one hand, and so sent them back
to the Fort, with order to tell the Commander, that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had taught them that kind of Mercy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Maurice Island, where they cut
Ebony.</HEAD>
<P>THE Island call'd <HI>Maurice</HI> Island lies almost in 84
degrees of Longitude, and 21 degrees of Southern
Latitude, being but 2 degrees and 30 minutes from
the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> right over against the middle of
the great Island of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which it has upon the West,
from whence it lies 140 Leagues, and is in compass about
60 Leagues. It bears great quantities of Ebony: and here
it was that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did formerly send their Slaves,
their banish'd and condemn'd Persons, to cut that sort of
Wood, which is Labour much more severe and cruel than
that of Rowing in the Galleys. The whole Island is subject
to those violent and outrageous Tempests call'd <HI>Ouragans,</HI>
which nothing can withstand, so that the People are forc'd to
dig themselves Holes in the ground, not being able to keep
their Huts standing. Neither had the poor Creatures any
other Food than a little boil'd Rice, and about a Farthings
worth of Salt-fish among four for a whole day. Since that
the Price of Ebony being brought very low, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
forsaken the Island, the Profit not bearing the sorry Expen∣ces
which those poor Creatures put them to.</P>
<P>So soon as this Tree is cut down it must be sawed into
Planks, and then buried seven or eight foot deep in the
Earth, which ought to be somewhat moist. There those
Planks must lie two years, and sometimes three, if the Wood
be very thick. After that the Wood is fit to be wrought up∣on,
neither will it splinter or split, and will the sooner ad∣mit
of a glittering Polishment.</P>
<P>This <HI>Maurice</HI> Island puts me in mind of a Story, that the
Sieur <HI>Loocker</HI> told me, concerning what befell him in his
Voyage from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Batavia</HI> in the Year 1643. <HI>Cha
Abbas</HI> the second of that Name, King of <HI>Persia,</HI> having a
great desire to learn to paint, signified to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at
<HI>Hispahan,</HI> that he desired them to send into <HI>Holland</HI> for some
<PB N="62" REF="55"/>
person who was excellent both in Designing and Painting.
Thereupon the Chief of the Factory wrote into <HI>Holland,</HI> and
upon his Letters the Company sent away <HI>Loocker,</HI> to oblige
the King; and to do him the greater honour, gave him the
charge of Merchant of the Vessel, who is equal with the
Captain, during the Voyage; to whom the Wind and Sea∣son
was very favourable till they came to the <HI>Cape of Good
Hope;</HI> but after they had doubled the Point, the Pilots bare
too much to the North, whereas they should have steered
directly East; so that when they had made the Height of the
Island of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> they met with nothing but contrary
Winds. For it is observable, that all the year long there
blows but one Wind toward <HI>Maurice</HI> Island; so that a Ship
may go thither in eight or nine days, but cannot return in
thirty or forty. For you must steer Westward to 30 de∣grees,
and from thence Eastward to 14 or 15 degrees, and
then you light upon <HI>Maurice</HI> Island. Five days together
the Ship was but rudely handled by the storm; which at
length grew so violent, and the Sea so boisterous, that all
the great Cabin was broken to pieces, the Beak of the Ship
carried away, and the Foremast made unserviceable. Thir∣teen
days together they remained in this miserable conditi∣on,
toss'd up and down by the Sea and Wind, all which time
they never saw the Sun, unable to take any height or ob∣servation
where they were. The fourteenth day it cleared
up, and the Sun appeared, and then taking the Height they
observed themselves to be not far from the <HI>Maurice</HI> Island,
which was very true; for the next day by break of day they
found themselves not above two Leagues from the Island;
and they found themselves upon the North side of the Island,
whereas the <HI>Hollanders</HI> liv'd upon the South. And there∣fore
perceiving that if the Wind did not change, it would be
a long time, and that with great difficulty too, before they
could fetch a compass about the Island to come to the Fort
where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were, they call'd a Council, where it
was resolved that <HI>Loocker</HI> with ten Souldiers should be put
on shoar, and that he should endeavour to get to the Fort
by Land, there to make provision of Water and Refresh∣ments
for the rest of the Company, against they could come
about. <HI>Maurice</HI> Island has this advantage, to be furnished
with excellent Water, and great store of Goats, Oranges,
<PB N="63" REF="55"/>
Citrons, and other Fruits: but when the <HI>Ouragans</HI> happen
there is not one to be seen upon the Trees, unless onely up∣on
those which are shelter'd by the Ebony Boughs, which
are thick and strong, and the Trees deeply rooted in the
Earth. <HI>Loocker</HI> thereupon with ten Souldiers was put on
shoar in a Shallop, with Provisions for six days. Nor was
the Island in that part above eight or ten Leagues broad,
which they thought to travel in few days: but the Woods
were so thick, that had they not been well provided of Car∣penters
Hatchets and Axes, they could never have made
their way. The first day they travell'd not above a League,
and the next day not above as much more, being still forced
to hack their way along with great travel and pains. So
that being now weary and spent, they laid themselves upon
the ground to repose themselves, and get a little sleep.
When they wak'd they heard the voices of several people,
which much rejoyced them, believing them to be the
Slaves and poor Creatures that were cutting Ebony not far
off. Thereupon they fell to work to get as near them as
they could: but the Woods proved so thick, that they de∣spair'd
of doing any good. Nevertheless the further they
advanced, the clearer they could hear the voices of the peo∣ple,
some speaking <HI>Dutch,</HI> others <HI>Portuguese.</HI> Whereupon
<HI>Loocker</HI> caus'd one of the Souldiers in his company that had
a strong voice, to call out in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Language, to
the people to come and help them. But instead of that
they all betook themselves to their heels, and fled to the
Commander's Lodge, telling him that there were Devils in
the Woods, and that they had call'd to them in the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Language. The Commander seeing both the Souldiers
and the Slaves in such a dismal amaze and terror, knew not
at first what to think; however he endeavoured to resettle
their distraction, and to revive a sort of people that were
half dead with fear. The next day he persuaded them to
return to their Work, persuading them to lay aside their
vain Fears, which proceeded onely from idle Apprehensi∣ons:
but they flatly denied him, telling him that they would
rather die, than return to be torn in pieces by the Devil.
However, others that had not been present at the accident,
and therefore gave not so much credit to the report, profer∣ed
to see the utmost of this business, provided any one that
<PB N="64" REF="56"/>
had heard the voice would bring them to the place. Away
upon this went a good number of them together, and co∣ming
to the place fell to work. Now because <HI>Loocker</HI> and
his Companions having labour'd all the night before, were
fallen asleep; for a good while the Workmen heard no
voice at all, nor so much as any thing stirring, so that they
began to laugh at those that had brought them thither, who
still obstinately maintained the truth of what they had heard.
This Dispute at length began to grow so hot and so loud,
that at length they wak'd <HI>Loocker</HI> and his Fellows, who be∣ing
now got nearer to them by means of their last nights la∣bour,
heard distinctly every word they said, and notwith∣standing
their distress could not chuse but laugh. Soon af∣ter
<HI>Loocker</HI> and the Souldiers call'd out again, <HI>Work toward
us,</HI> they cried, <HI>we are Hollanders, come and help us out of the
Wood, and we will put an end to the dispute.</HI> But the Workmen
no sooner heard them, but away they ran for their Lives,
and when they came to the Lodge, they were so har'd, so
scar'd, and quite out of breath, that the Governour in vain
endeavour'd to get the least tittle of a word from them. At
length being come to themselves, they assur'd him that it
was too true that the Devils were in the Wood, and that the
more to deceive and wheedle them, to day they had not
onely spoken <HI>Portuguese,</HI> but <HI>Dutch</HI> too. This put the Go∣vernour
and all into a deep Consternation, insomuch that
they were all at their Wits end. But the next morning
<HI>Loocker</HI> and his Gang having made their way through, the
Centinel spied them first from the Fort, and by the dis∣charge
of his Musquet gave notice of the approach of the
Devils. And then it was that the poor affrighted Mortals,
laying aside their fears, and going forth to meet their own
Shapes, found them to be a company of their Countrymen
in distress, whom they then received into their kindness, to
give an account of their Misfortunes. Three days after the
Ship came into Harbour, though in a miserable condition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Grandeur of the General at Batavia, and
what befell his Wife and his Niece.</HEAD>
<P>THe Company to maintain their Authority and
Commerce in the <HI>Indies,</HI> believe it to be to their
advantage, that the General whom they send to <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI>
and who commands in all the places in <HI>Asia</HI> where
the <HI>Dutch</HI> traffic, should keep up the Port of a Prince.
There is no Cavalry in <HI>Europe</HI> so well clad or mounted as
his; the Horsemen all upon <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Steeds. Nor
is his Foot Guard less sumptuous: His Halberdiers wear
their yellow Satten Doublets, Scarlet Breeches lac'd with
Silver Lace, and their Silk Stockins. But this onely for the
General's Guards; for those which they send abroad to their
Forts and Garrisons, it is a great pity to see how poorly they
are attir'd, and how meanly fed. When the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet
arrives at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the Souldiers which they bring are
drawn up in the Parade of the Fortress by the Major, who
chuses out the handsomest to remain at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the rest
are sent and distributed into other places. When the Gene∣ral
and his Wife go abroad, they always ride in their Coach
and six Horses, with six Halberdiers attending at each Boot,
and a Troop of Horse and two Companies of Foot for their
Guard. The Authority of the General is very great, though
he may be sometimes commanded by his Wife: neither is it
safe for them that depend upon them, to do or say any thing
that may offend them. But for others, who have their Im∣ployments
immediately from the Company, they never ob∣lige
themselves to be so circumspect. For truth whereof I
will relate the following pleasant Story.</P>
<P>The Wife of General <HI>Matsuker</HI> having one day underta∣ken
to play upon a Captain of a Ship call'd the <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and
to laugh at him, for having lost a Bale of Goods which had
been seized by the Company, in regard no particular person
is permitted to trade. The Captain nettled at her Discourse▪
resolved to be revenged. Nor was it long before he found
<PB N="66" REF="57"/>
the means; for being commanded away for <HI>Maslipatan</HI> in
the Kingdom of <HI>Goleonda,</HI> where being arriv'd, laden, and
ready to set Sail to return to <HI>Batavia,</HI> the chief of the Factory
desired him to take in four Bales of Goods for the General's
Wife, as belonging to her, and to deliver them privately to
her. This was Nuts to the Captain: so that being return'd
to <HI>Batavia,</HI> he went he went immediately to visit the Ge∣neral,
and deliver him the Letters which concerned the <HI>Car∣go.</HI>
Immediately according to custom the General invited
him to dinner, at which time it is usual for the General to
inform himself of the Condition of the Factory. Among
the rest of the questions the General asked the Captain whe∣ther
he had any Counterband Goods aboard, or any that
were not upon the Company's sole account. To which
the Captain answered, that all the Goods belonged to the
Company, except four Bales, which the chief Factor at
<HI>Maslipatan</HI> had particularly recommended to his care, as be∣longing
to Madam General. This being publickly spoken
in the presence of a great many that were at Table, the Lady
that was not aware of such a blow, was not a little surpriz'd,
and the General himself was not a little in wrath, sternly
ask'd her how she durst undertake to trade without his
knowledge. Presently she denied the whole matter, and
averred that the Captain was mistaken, and took her for some
other person. But the General sent for the Fiscal, and or∣der'd
him to go forthwith with the Captain, and fetch the
four Bales ashoar; which being done, he order'd further
that the Goods should be carried into the public Hall of the
Town House, with a Writing fix'd upon them, that who∣ever
own'd those Goods should come and claim them; but
no body came. So that the Captain had the pleasure to see
the Lady in a delicate raging passion, and the Goods dispos'd
of to the Fiscal, and the Poor of the Hospital.</P>
<P>The same General and his Wife having no Children, they
began to consider to whom they should leave their Estates.
At length the General bethought himself of a Niece he had
at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and therefore wrote to the Directors of the
Company to send her to him. This Niece of his cried Pot∣herbs
and Onions about the street to get her living; in which
Calling she was at last found out, and brought to the Dire∣ctors,
who presently changed her Habit, and of a Crier of
<PB N="67" REF="57"/>
Cabbage made her a little Lady; who though she were of
such a low condition, was not without a good proportion
of natural Beauty.</P>
<P>The Fleet being ready to depart, there was a Cabin built
on purpose for this Niece, and the Company having pre∣sented
her with several pieces of Tissue and Silks; recom∣mended
her to <HI>C. Rosse,</HI> the Viceadmiral's care. This Cap∣tain
had been several times at the <HI>Indies</HI> before, and was
both rich and a Batchelour: so that when the Ship was out
at Sea, he fail'd not to shew all the respects imaginable to
this Niece. Now this young Virgin not being accustomed
to the Sea, upon the least gust of Wind she was half dead;
and all that time the Captain would not stir from her Bed-side,
for fear any Accident should befall her. And as he
was thus diligent not to stir from her Bed-side in fowl, 'tis
verily believ'd he was seldom far from it in fair weather;
and that instead of sitting by her Bed-side, he sometimes got
fairly into it. But whether he were within or without,
most certain it is, that before Madam Niece arrived at <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI>
she found her self to be with child, though she so
discreetly concealed it, that none in the Vessel percei∣ved
it.</P>
<P>The Vessel had no sooner passed the Strait that lies to∣ward
<HI>Bantam,</HI> but Madam General with a great number of
her Friends in several little Barques came out to meet Ma∣dam
Niece, and were not a little surprized to find her to be
a person so well clad and handsom withall, without any
appearance of what she had been before.</P>
<P>A Coach and six Horses, and six Halberdiers, a Troop
of Horse, and a Company of Foot, waited upon the shoar
for Madam General. And thus was madam Niece conduct∣ed
to the Fort with great pomp, and as kindly received by
Monsieur General. Some few days after several of the Gal∣lants
of <HI>Batavia</HI> came picquiering to the House to see Ma∣dam
Niece; and so it was, that all being smitten, every one
desired her in Marriage: but both Uncle and Aunt were
deaf to all their Suits, as having design'd her to a young rich
Merchant, who was then out of the way. <HI>C. Rosse</HI> laugh'd
in his sleeve at the bustle that was made, and still continued
his former respects and double Diligences, which were the
more willingly permitted him in regard of the great care of
<PB N="68" REF="58"/>
their Niece, for which the Uncle and the Aunt thought
themselves oblig'd to him during their Voyage. But at
length seeing such a swarm of Sweethearts about her, he
thought it but charity to undeceive so many poor Gulls, and
without further ceremony to go to her Aunt, and to demand
her Niece for his Wife. The She General who look'd up∣on
herself to be a kind of a Queen at <HI>Batavia,</HI> look'd upon
it as a high offence and indignity for a Tarpaulin Captain
of a Ship to dare to make her such a Proposal, having alrea∣dy
refus'd such Matches, persons that might come to be
Privy Counsellors of all the <HI>Indies.</HI> Nevertheless within a
day or two after the Captain renewed his Charge, but then
in a Majestic Fury she utterly forbid him the Fort. He ta∣king
little notice of her rage, goes to the General, and after
some Discourse makes the same Proposal, and receives the
same Answer. But then the Captain gave the Husband
such a Bone to pick, that he would not give the Wife; Sir,
said he, twice already have I demanded your Niece in Mar∣riage,
this is now the third time that I make the same de∣mand;
if you refuse me, you shall ask me four times before
I accept of her: and so saying briskly left him. The Gene∣ral
reflecting upon the Captain's words, went to his Wife
and told her the Story, who guessing at the effects of a long
Voyage Familiarity, call'd Madam Niece into examination:
She not being us'd to Dissimulation confess'd the whole mat∣ter,
and without any more to do was married to the Cap∣tain,
to the great wonder of the whole City, till the birth
of a Boy at the end of six moneths unfolded the Riddle. But
this lying in was her ruin; for about five or six days after,
the Mother and the Nurse being ill, the chief Chirurgeon
of the Fort order'd them to take a little <HI>Cremor Tartar;</HI> and
to that purpose sent a young man to the Master Chirurgeon
of the Town, to send him two quantities of <HI>Cremor Tartar</HI>
in two Papers. He being drinking with his Friends, sends a
young Barber newly come from <HI>Holland,</HI> to put up the two
quantities according to direction. But the Barber mistook
the Glass, and put up <HI>Sublimate</HI> instead of <HI>Cremor Tartar.</HI> So
the two Women taking their Doses, dissolved in two Silver
Cups of fair Water, died in 24 hours after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of General Vanderbroug, and of the Original
of the City of Batavia</HEAD>
<P>GEneral <HI>Vanderbroug</HI> was of <HI>Anverse,</HI> and having stu∣died
in the Jesuits College, retained some tincture
of Learning, which he endeavoured to improve
as much as his business would give him leave. While he
was General he caus'd the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to be translated out of
<HI>Arabic</HI> into <HI>Dutch.</HI> He was also a man of courage, and se∣veral
times expos'd himself to great hazards for the Service
of the Company, as you shall see by the following Re∣lation.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had taken several Prizes from the
<HI>Portuguezes</HI> by Sea, they wanted a place of Retreat, where
they might repair their endamaged Ships, and repose after
the toils of the Sea. At first they cast their eyes upon the
Island of <HI>Java,</HI> in that place where the <HI>English</HI> had built a
small Convenience for their Trade. There is a Road in
that part, where Vessels ride securely all the year, into which
a River discharges it self that will receive Shallops of good
burthen, for above a thousand Paces. The Water of this
River is most excellent; for being carried never so far to
Sea, it never stinks, nor engenders Worms; which can only
be said of the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI> besides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> therefore came and lay upon the point of
a River, over against the place where the <HI>English</HI> had their
small House. They had with them then the greatest part
of the Ships which they had in the <HI>Indies,</HI> laden with those
great Bales of Cloth which come from <HI>Bengale</HI> and the Coast
of <HI>Surat,</HI> so big that a dozen men can hardly manage them▪
These Bales they landed, and of them made a kind of Forti∣fication,
planting a good number of great Guns between
them: For they never wanted great Guns ever since they
traded alone to <HI>Japon,</HI> the onely Kingdom of the World
abounding in Copper; from whence they brought prodigi∣ous
quantities to <HI>Macao</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> where they cast their Artil∣lery.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="59"/>
Thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thought that by Sea no body could
endamage their small Fortification, made of Bales of cloth,
which was defended by their Vessels which they had in the
Road: But by Land they were afraid that the King of
the Island, <HI>viz.</HI> either of <HI>Materan</HI> or <HI>Bantam,</HI> might di∣sturb
them. Observing therefore the Situation of the Island,
which on that side was all covered with Woods, which
reached on that side within a League of the Sea; and that
where they ended, to the Shoar there was no other way but
a Bank, which separated the Marsh from the River: So that
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> the better to secure themselves against the
two Kings, resolved to raise a Tower upon the Bank. In
this Tower they planted several Culverins and small Pieces,
cramm'd with artificial Wildfire, and every evening relieved
their Guards. The King of <HI>Materan</HI> perceiving this, and
believing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not stop here, advanced
a powerful Army to pull down the Tower. To which
purpose he brought with him great Chains of Iron, and
Cables made of the <HI>Coco</HI> Flax; believing that by the favour
of the Night, having got his Chains and Ropes about the
Tower, by the strength of his Men and Elephants he might
easily pull it down. But having fail'd in his Enterprize, and
for that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Artillery kill'd him abundance of
Men, he retreated with his Army. But it was not long be∣fore
he return'd again with a more powerful Force by Land,
and also a great Fleet of small Vessels to assist him by Sea.
With these Forces he gave a furious Onset a second time,
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with no less vigour sustained, and beat
him off. But nothing discouraged with his loss, he resolved
to give a third Onset, onely he staid some few days in expe∣ctation
of more Forces.</P>
<P>In the mean while one of the most considerable Captains
of his Army was accus'd to the King not to have done his
Duty: though seasonably advertiz'd that the King was re∣solv'd
to seize upon his person, and cut him to pieces. For
you must know, that among the <HI>Javans</HI> when any person
has merited Death, they tie the Offender all along upon a
great piece of Timber, and the next Lord or great person
that has a mind to try the goodness of his Scimitar, comes
and cuts the Body into four pieces, the first stroak being made
upon the Brest, the second upon the Pit of the Stomach, the
<PB N="71" REF="59"/>
third upon the lower part of the Belly. The four pieces
if they be Men, are burnt; if Women, thrown to the Dogs,
which they keep for that purpose. For the <HI>Javans</HI> never
burn any person.</P>
<P>This <HI>Javanese</HI> Lord therefore knowing what he was to
trust to, made his escape to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and was kindly
received by <HI>Vanderbroug.</HI> To ingratiate himself, he told
the <HI>Dutch</HI> General all the King's Designs in reference to the
carrying the place; where he would make his Onset, and
what number of men he had. This however did not suffi∣ciently
chear up the General, who knew his own weakness.
So that the <HI>Javanese</HI> perceiving him still pensive, I find (said
he) that thou art afraid of the King's strength, and reason
thou hast, but be rul'd by me: Thou art not ignorant that
the <HI>Javanners</HI> are rigid Observers of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
and that if any Uncleanness from a Christian hand falls upon
their Clothes, they fling them away, and spend six whole
days in washing themselves, before they believe themselves
clean. Hear then, said he; let all the Ordure and Dung of
the People that are with thee be heaped in a place together,
and made fluid in Pots for that purpose; and when they
mount their Ladders, spare not for Showres of that Liquor,
and I warrant ye they will retreat faster than they came on.
Farther continued he; I know that the points of their Ar∣rows
and <HI>Cric's</HI> are poison'd, and that this poison is so
strong, that whoever are wounded therewith die suddenly,
unless they have recourse to this onely Remedy; which is to
preserve their own Excrement, and to dry it to powder;
and when they find themselves wounded, to take a little of
the powder, and drink it off in a small Beer-glass of Water.
The General observing what the <HI>Javan</HI> Lord had said, when
the Enemy mounted their Ladders, lustily besmear'd them
with the Liquor, which he caus'd to be prepar'd against their
coming; so that instead of gaining the tops of their Ladders,
they made all the haste they could down again; but being
hindred by those that follow'd them, they threw themselves
headlong to the ground; by which means several of them
were maimed, and several kill'd outright. Thus the Army
disbanded in a moment, and the Emperour was the first that
took his flight. <HI>Vanderbroug</HI> observing the disorderly Re∣treat
of the Enemy, took a small Party with him, and pur∣su'd
<PB N="72" REF="60"/>
the flying Enemy, who being enclosed by those in the
Fort, that sally'd out upon them, were miserably cut in pie∣ces.
But the General having left the greatest part of his
men, and returning onely with a small and very inconsider∣able
Company, the <HI>Javanners</HI> who had hid themselves in
the Mershes for fear, resum'd courage, and suddenly fell up∣on
him in his return, and so encompass'd him on every side,
that it was impossible for him to escape. However they de∣fended
themselves stoutly for a while, but being wounded
with the Arrows and <HI>Cric's</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and not being
provided of the forementioned Antidote, they died imme∣diately.
The General was taken alive, not so much as
wounded; for as he told me afterwards himself, he found
they had no desire to kill him. So soon as he was taken
they carried him to the Emperour, who as soon as he saw
him bid him not fear any thing, but told him withall, that
it was his pleasure, that he should command his Men to
quit the Fort and Tower, and be gone; otherwise that he
would make both him, and all those that should fall into
his Hands, perpetual Slaves. At the same time the Empe∣rour
with his principal Officers, and the General with a good
Guard, came to the Foot of the Wall of the Tower, where
the General in the <HI>Malay</HI> Language, laying before them
his own misfortune, and the improbability of their holding
out long, commanded them to quit the Fort, after they had
embarqued whatever they saw fitting, but onely 6 Pieces of
small Canon, 200 Bullets, and 500 Quintals of Powder.
The Emperour was overjoy'd to hear what the General said,
and thought himself sure of the Fort and Tower. But then
the General turning to the Emperour, told him, that none
of his men understood <HI>Malay,</HI> and that therefore it would
be convenient for him to repeat the same in <HI>Flemish.</HI>
Which being granted, he spoke to the Souldiers in <HI>Flemish,</HI>
and ordered them quite the contrary; that is to say, that
they should not be Traitors to their Countrey, but hold out
the place till death, not minding what became of him; and
to that end, that they should bid the Infidels forthwith re∣tire,
or else they would immediately fire all their Guns up∣on
them. The Emperour astonish'd at their Resolution re∣treats,
and carries the General with him. Being thus re∣tir'd,
the General made him believe that he would find a
<PB N="73" REF="60"/>
means to write to the Company, to give them an account
of what had pass'd, and that he was confident they would
give such order for an Accommodation, as should satisfie
His Majesty, which satisfi'd the Emperour for that time. In
the mean while the General found an opportunity to get
into a small Barque, and to get to the Fort, where he was joy∣fully
receiv'd. This Recital I had from his own mouth.</P>
<P>The General having done this and several other eminent
Services for the Company, and acquitted himself with Re∣putation
and a fair Estate, was desirous to return home,
where the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and several of the States had
no less a desire to see him. Streight he took up his Habita∣tion
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and for a good while liv'd splendidly,
gave great Presents and Entertainments to the Prince, and
several other Grandees of <HI>Holland,</HI> by which means he ran
himself into so great an Expence, that he was forc'd to de∣sire
of the Company, that he might return into their Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>One day the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> asking him what Rarities
he had brought out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> he call'd for five Silver
Plates, and setting them upon the Table, drew out five
little Bags out of his Pocket, and emptied a several Bag up∣on
a several Plate; which surpriz'd not onely the Prince,
but several others of the States then present, to see such a
number of Diamonds and other Jewels of a vast value.</P>
<P>It was not without some difficulty that he was again en∣tertain'd
by the Company; but at length they sent him Ad∣miral
of two Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where being arriv'd, the Ge∣neral
and Consuls made him Admiral of the Fleet that was
just bound for the Coast of <HI>Coromandel, Surat,</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>Being return'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> General <HI>Vandyme</HI> and the Coun∣cil
sent him to <HI>Malaca,</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> then besieg'd,
and where they found a stouter resistance than they imagin'd.
There in an assault upon the Town he received a slight
Wound, of which he was quickly cur'd; but soon after he
fell sick, and died before the Town was surrendred.</P>

<PB N="74" REF="61"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Country about Cochin, and how the Holland
General crown'd one of the Indian Princes.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Countrey about <HI>Cochin</HI> is planted for the
most part with that sort of Tree which they call
<HI>Cocos,</HI> the Fruit whereof produces that sort of Wine
which the Inhabitants call <HI>Tary,</HI> whereof they make their
Strong Water. They mingle this Wine with course black
Sugar unrefin'd, together with the Bark of a Tree which
bears nothing but Thorns. This Bark causes the <HI>Tary</HI> and
Sugar to boil and ferment like new Wine. When the <HI>Tary</HI>
and the Sugar have fermented for above seven or eight hours,
they distill them in an Alembic, and make Strong Water,
which is stronger or smaller, by how much the more often or
seldomer it is distill'd.</P>
<P>Besides the Coverture of these Trees the whole Country
is full of Cows; for they are all Idolaters in this Country,
that onely worship their Cows for their Gods, feed upon
their Milk, and eat nothing that has Life.</P>
<P>When you leave the Countries of these Princes, which
they call <HI>Rajas,</HI> travelling toward the North East you enter
into the Territories of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velouche,</HI> which are of a
large extent. He and all his Subjects being Idolaters, un∣less
it be about nine or ten thousand poor People call'd <HI>Chri∣stians
of S. John,</HI> as being baptiz'd after the same manner that
S. <HI>John</HI> baptiz'd the People in the Wilderness.</P>
<P>After the taking of <HI>Cochin,</HI> of which we have given a full
Relation in our <HI>Indian</HI> Travels, General <HI>Vangous,</HI> who com∣manded
at the Siege, became so haughty that he despis'd
all the other Officers, as well Military as those that belonged
to the Government and Justice of the City. However to
recompence one of the <HI>Raja's</HI> by whose means he had ta∣ken
the City, he persuaded him to quit the Name of <HI>Raja,</HI>
and to assume the Title of <HI>King,</HI> that he might have the
Honour to set the Crown upon his Head. To this end he
made great inquiry through his whole Army for a Gold∣smith,
<PB N="75" REF="61"/>
and having found out one that undertook it, and
caus'd him to make a Crown of massie Gold, that weigh'd
near ten Marks, which I believe the <HI>Raja</HI> found more in∣convenient
and weighty upon his Head, than an old Muc∣kender
with three corners bound about his Head, which is the
mark of the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Sovereignty.</P>
<P>While they were making this Crown there were great
preparations for the Ceremony: It was performed in a Gar∣den
near the Town, where was set a large Tent spread all
over with painted Calicut. Within was a Throne erected
with a Canopy of <HI>China</HI> Damask, and all the Steps to the
Throne were cover'd with <HI>Persian</HI> Tapistry.</P>
<P>The day being come, the greatest part of the Army, Offi∣cers
and Souldiers, went to fetch the <HI>Raja,</HI> who lay in his
Hut a quarter of a League off; where they mounted him
upon one of two Elephants which the General sent him, be∣ing
attended likewise with two led Horses, and two <HI>Palan∣quins</HI>
for more State. Being come to the place, he was clad
in a Scarlet Robe with great Hanging Sleeves, and so brought
in where <HI>Vangous</HI> was sitting upon his Throne, with a
Sword and a Crown by him. The <HI>Raja</HI> being come to the
Foot of the Throne, the Major of the Army took the Sword,
deliver'd him by the General, and girt the <HI>Raja,</HI> who then
ascending the Steps of the Throne, prostrated himself be∣fore
the <HI>Holland</HI> General while he put the Crown upon his
Head. Then the new King riseth up, and lays his Hand
upon the Head of a Cow that stood near the Throne. Which
done, kneeling with his Hands clasp'd, and lifted toward
the Head of the same Cow, he took his Oath to be true and
faithful to the Company, and to embrace their Interests.
On the other side the General promis'd him on the behalf of
the Company, that they should assist him when he should
have occasion against his Enemies. Which Solemnities be∣ing
very gravely perform'd, the Musquettiers gave three
Volleys, and the new King was conducted back to his Hut
with the same Pomp that he was brought. Thus you see the
Pride of a Pepper Merchant, to make Kings and domineer
over Crowns.</P>
<P>One other famous Act of <HI>Vangous</HI> must not be forgotten.
You must know, that at the taking of <HI>Cochin</HI> the Jesuits had
in that City one of the fairest Libraries in all <HI>Asia,</HI> as well
<PB N="76" REF="62"/>
for the great quantity of Books sent them out of <HI>Europe,</HI> as
for several rare Manuscripts in the <HI>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic,
Persian, Indian, Chinese,</HI> and other Oriental Languages. For
in all the Conquests of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> their first care was to
summon all the Learned People of the several Nations, and
to get all their Books into their hands. During that little
time which the Jesuits staid in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> they had copied out
all the good Books that came to their knowledge, and sent
all those Books of <HI>Cochin.</HI> They had staid longer in <HI>Aethio∣pia,</HI>
had it not been for the Jealousie of the Patriarchs, and
their Bishops, which are very numerous; so that if there be
two men in one Village that belong to one Church, the chief∣est
calls himself Bishop. At their Ceremonies of Baptism
when they name the Holy Ghost, they apply a hot Iron to
the neck of the Infant, saying that the Holy Ghost descended
upon the Apostles in the shape of Fiery Tongues. The Pa∣triarchs
and Bishops were jealous of the Jesuits, finding that
they had insinuated themselves into the favour of the King
and Grandees of the Court. Which so enraged the <HI>Aethiopi∣ans,</HI>
that they caus'd the People to mutiny, preaching that
the King was about to alter the Religion of the Country, and
to draw along with him several of the Lords. And the
Fury of the People grew to that height, that whatever the
King could do or say, he could not appease their Fury: So
that they put him in prison, and elected his Brother in his
place. The cause of this disorder was laid upon the Jesuits,
and was the reason that they were expell'd the Kingdom;
neither had they scap'd so, but that they were afraid of the
Governour of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> and the <HI>Portugals</HI> that inhabit all
along the Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI> But to tell ye what became of
this Library, General <HI>Vangous</HI> made no conscience to expose
it to the ignorance of his Souldiers, so that I have seen the
Souldiers and Seamen tear several of those beautiful Volums
to light their Tobacco.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sieur Hollebrand Glins, President of the
Factory at Ormus.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the Ships come to <HI>Ormus,</HI> it is a great pre∣judice
for the Goods to lie out of doors. For
such is the extremity of the Heat in that part,
that if the Spices, especially the Cloves, be not carried to the
Water-side every foot, and there laid to steep in the Water
for four and twenty hours, they would turn to a mere
powder.</P>
<P>Sugar is brought thither in great Wooden Chests, but if
there be the least Cleft for a Fly or an Emmet to get in, in a
small time the Chest will be half emptied.</P>
<P>As for Camphire, which is brought from <HI>Borneo</HI> in Pipes,
if it lie a little too long in that warm Air, it will exhale above
half away.</P>
<P>To remedy these Inconveniences <HI>Sieur Hollebrand</HI> resol∣ved
to build a bigger Warehouse. Among the rest of the
Workmen that were imployed in this Building was a Gun∣smith,
who came in the <HI>interim</HI> in a Ship from <HI>Batavia.</HI>
This poor Fellow was imployed to make Locks for the
Warehouse; for in those Parts they have no other Keys, or
Locks either, than what are made of Wood: So that it was
a Crime for him to be found idle at any time. And there∣fore
the President finding him one Sunday in the Afternoon
drinking with two of his Companions that came from the
Ship to see him, gave the Fellow half a dozen good Licks
with his Cane, and would have given him more, but that
the Smith being a sturdy Fellow, and feeling the Blows smart,
wrested the Stick out of the President's Hands, and flung it
out of the Window. For which the President, upon pre∣tence
that the Fellow had struck him four Blows, which was
untrue, as I my self being there could witness, sent him la∣den
with Chains to the Ship, where he would have tried
him for his Life, in a full Court of the Merchants of the Fa∣ctory:
but they refusing him, for very madness he took
<PB N="78" REF="63"/>
two Notaries, that he had a power over, went to the Ship
alone, made the Officers of the Ship, and condemn'd the
Fellow to be hang'd. And he had certainly been executed
but for me and some other of my Countrymen, (for the Fel∣low
was of <HI>Geneva</HI>) that threatned the President out of his
design. Yet he caus'd him to be drubb'd Naked at the
Main Mast after that inhuman manner, that he lost the use
of one of his Arms. This the <HI>Genevese</HI> could never forget,
and therefore sought all opportunities to kill him; to which
purpose he put himself in the same Ship with <HI>Hollebrand</HI>
when he returned for <HI>Holland.</HI> But coming to the <HI>Cape of
Good Hope,</HI> and being sent ashoar in the Shallop for Provisi∣ons,
the Shallop was overset in a stormy Sea, and <HI>Hollebrand</HI>'s
Life thereby secur'd.</P>
<P>But before we leave <HI>Ormus,</HI> where <HI>Hollebrand</HI> was build∣ing
his Warehouse that caus'd all this mischief, let us take
notice of this by the way, that there is no abiding at <HI>Ormus</HI>
till <HI>April,</HI> lest you pay for your stay with some Malignant
Fever, that may hold a man as long as he lives; or if he be
cur'd by chance, yet will the White of his Eyes be more yel∣low
than Saffron. This same sort of Fever seizes our <HI>Euro∣peans</HI>
in the Port of <HI>Alexandretta</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and in the Islands
where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lade their Cloves, Nutmegs, and
Mace.</P>
<P>By the way observe, that there is a particular sort of Nut∣meg
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call <HI>Maneque,</HI> and we the Male
Nutmeg, as long again and a little bigger than the ordinary
Nutmeg; and this sort they never carry into <HI>Europe,</HI> because
they sell it to better profit in <HI>Persia</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> This I
shall also further add, that the ordinary Nutmeg condited,
fuddles more than the strongest Wine, eating but onely one
either at the beginning or ending of the Meal.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Touching the Islands of the Prince.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fort of <HI>Batavia</HI> has four fair Bastions, and is
well built but upon an ill Foundation, those Bastions
being plainly observ'd to sink, and requiring Repa∣ration
from time to time. For the perfecting of which Work
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> wanted Slaves: whereupon a Consultation
was had where to get Slaves. To which Answer was made,
that there was no better place than the Prince's Islands.
Which being concluded, the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> dispatch'd
away three the biggest Ships belonging to <HI>Batavia.</HI> These
Ships visited every one of these Islands; feigning that they
came from <HI>Holland</HI> and wanted Refreshment. So soon as
the Inhabitants discover'd the Vessels, they flock'd to the
Shoar Men, Women, and Children, as they wont to do,
bringing along with them the best of their Provision, as <HI>Coco</HI>
Wine, Nuts, and other Fruits of the growth of the Islands.
Happy were they that could first get aboard, for they always
get more by the Mariners and Souldiers, than by those that
go ashoar to trade. Now so soon as they were ashoar, they
gave them Strong Water to drink till they were drunk; and
when the Masters of the Ships saw them in that condition,
they immediately sent a good number of their men well ar∣med
ashoar, who bound them that were upon the Sand to
truck for their goods, and carried them away to their Ships,
killing all those that made any resistance. But they did them
little service; for finding themselves so inhumanly us'd as
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> use their Slaves, they took a resolution to eat
nothing, and to starve themselves to death, rather than to be
forc'd to labour and be beaten every day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the Hollanders sent to declare War against the
Persians, and of the ill Success of their Fleet.</HEAD>
<P>MUch about the same time <HI>Charles Constant</HI> was sent
by the Company with a Fleet of seven great
Ships, to declare War against the <HI>Persians,</HI> in case
they would not comply with the <HI>Dutch</HI> in reference to their
Silk Trade and their Customs. Being arriv'd at <HI>Ormus</HI> he
left the Fleet there, and hasten'd to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and from thence
to <HI>Casbin,</HI> where then the King was. But his Embassie had
not that effect as he expected: For he thought that the King
would have been frighted at the noise of a Fleet of seven
great Ships that lay at <HI>Ormus,</HI> but he was mistaken. For
the <HI>Persian</HI> knew he need not send any Force against the
said Fleet, in regard it would be ruin'd without: It being
impossible for our <HI>Europeans</HI> to stay at <HI>Ormus</HI> in the heat of
Somer, as well by reason of the Heat, as for want of Water;
for there is no good Water at <HI>Ormus,</HI> nor upon any part of
the Coast of <HI>Persia,</HI> but what is kept in Cisterns, and that
full of Worms. 'Tis true, that upon the Coast of <HI>Arabia</HI>
there are Wells of good Water, but when the <HI>Arabians</HI> dis∣cover
any Ships upon the Coast, they come down all in
Arms to defend their Wells; for it is their profit to sell their
Water, and that at a very dear rate, to those that are in ne∣cessity.</P>
<P>Now the King and Council not being ignorant, that the
longer the Fleet lay at <HI>Ormus,</HI> the worse would be its con∣dition,
would not give the Commander his first Audience
in two moneths. During which time there died above half
the Men; for from six a clock in the morning till four in the
afternoon, if any of the Seamen went to take a little Air
upon the Deck, he presently fell down dead. The Admi∣ral
was to blame not to make provision of Water being
bound for such a place as <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The Commander <HI>Constant</HI> did not take the right course
to effect his business, by publishing what he intended to pre∣sent
<PB N="81" REF="64"/>
the Ministers of State withall. For the Lords of <HI>Persia</HI>
never take any Presents themselves, for fear it should come
to the King's Ear. But there is a private Bill sent to the
Party for whom it is intended, and he sends whom he thinks
fit to receive it. Had he so done, and doubled his Sum of
5000 <HI>Venetian</HI> Ducats, perhaps the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> might have
us'd him more kindly, especially for so long time as that
King had. For whatever a Predecessor does, a Successor
changes many things. So that if the deceased King have
given any House or Land to any person, it must be confirm∣ed
by the succeeding King in his first Year, or else the Gift
returns to the King. It is the same thing if any person builds
a House upon the King's Demesns: which has been a great
inconvenience to the <HI>Austin</HI> Friers and bare-foot <HI>Carmelites,</HI>
because their Houses are built upon the Lands which
<HI>Cha Abbas</HI> gave them of the Royal Demesns. So that
every time a new King ascends the Throne, they are forc'd
to make the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> new Presents, sometimes to the
Value of the Land: for it is a rare thing to find a prime
Minister that is a Friend to the Christians▪ But the Jesuits
and Capuchins, who came after them, provided better for
themselves, each of those Orders having bought the Ground
upon which their Houses are built.</P>
<P>The Commander seeing that he could not compass his
Design, and that the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> would abate nothing of
the forty four <HI>Tomans</HI> which he demanded, went to the
<HI>Divanbegai</HI> and told him, that buying the same Goods of
particular persons, they might be had for thirty two, or at
most for thirty three <HI>Tomans.</HI> To which the <HI>Divanbegai</HI> an∣swered
him, That all those particular persons paid the King
Custom, and Convoy upon the Road, the Custom alone
amounting to Eighteen <HI>per cent.</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did
not pay: and that there was not a Year wherein they did
not bring in Goods to the Value of 30000 <HI>Tomans;</HI> and that
if account should be taken of the Silks which they carried
away, and of the Goods which they brought in, the <HI>Athema∣doulet</HI>
ought to make them pay near 50000 <HI>Tomans</HI> for Du∣ties.
The Commander ill satisfied with this Answer went
to his Lodging, and without asking the Advice of the Mer∣chants
that were with him, or of his <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who better
understood the Practice of the Court, or without taking his
<PB N="82" REF="65"/>
leave of the King, return'd privately to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> intending
for <HI>Bander</HI> where the Fleet lay. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> being
advertiz'd of his sudden departure, was very much offend∣ed;
so much the more because at the Commanders first Ar∣rival
he had done him great Civilities, even to the furnish∣ing
his Lodgings after the <HI>European</HI> manner, with a Bed,
Stools, and Tables. Thereupon he gave notice thereof to
the King, who when he heard of it utter'd these words,
<HI>Has any one given him any distaste, or is he turn'd Fool? He shall be
glad to come back again.</HI></P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> to the great wonder of the <HI>Franks,</HI>
who heard nothing of his taking leave of the King, he be∣gan
to make up his Pack, intending for <HI>Gomrom,</HI> in case the
King did not send for him again; which he did, 'tis true, but
not with those Compliments which he expected; for he
flatter'd himself that the King would have petition'd him to
return. The King sent for him indeed, but his Compliment
was not very pleasing; for the person that brought the
Message told him, That it was the King's pleasure he should
speedily return, and if he would not go willingly he had
order to carry him by force. But notwithstanding the King's
Command and the Counsel of his Friends, he set out from
<HI>Ispahan</HI> for <HI>Bander,</HI> according to his first intent. We accom∣panied
him some part of his way, and being just ready to
take our leaves, we saw a <HI>Persian</HI> Gentile and well mount∣ed,
(he was a Captain of an hundred men) who calling the
Interpreter to him, Go (said he) and tell thy President, that
he must return to his Lodging, and to morrow make haste
to the King, according to the Order he has already recei∣ved:
and with that he rode away full speed. The Inter∣preter
told the Commander what the Captain said; but not∣withstanding
all this the Commander being a person of a
hot and obstinate humour, continued his way. Neither the
Merchants of <HI>Zulpha,</HI> nor any of the <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI>
Servants would follow him, fearing the Bastinado, and be∣lieving
he was secure enough; as it happen'd: for he had
not rode far, before three Captains with their Bows and Ar∣rows
in their hands bolted out upon him, one of which ri∣ding
up directly to the Commander, Art thou (said he) the
onely person that ever set foot in this Empire, that refusest
to obey the Companion of the Sun, whom so great a part
<PB N="83" REF="65"/>
of the World obeys? At the same time came up fifty stout
Horsemen, and one of them who cammanded them made
at Mr. <HI>Constant</HI> with his Mace. Then the Admiral was
forc'd to lower his Sails and return back, forc'd to receive an
Affront which he might have avoided▪ When he was come
to his Lodging, the <HI>Persian</HI> Officer without alighting call'd
the Interpreter, and bid him go forwarn the Commander
in the Name of the King, that neither he nor any of the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> presumed to stir out of their Houses till further
order; for that if any of them were seen abroad, they should
be taught to obey the King's Commands. Thus the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
having been coop'd up nine days, word was brought
the Commander he might return to <HI>Cusbin,</HI> where he found
that all his <HI>Rodomontado's</HI> signified nothing, but that he must
comply with the <HI>Athemadoulet.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Severity of the Holland Commanders
in the Indies.</HEAD>
<P>GEneral <HI>Speck,</HI> before he came to his Imployment,
had a Daughter by a Woman which he kept onely
as his Mistress, not as his Wife. After his time
was out he returned into <HI>Holland,</HI> and not being willing to
carry his Daughter along with him, knowing that she would
go off better at <HI>Batavia</HI> than in <HI>Holland,</HI> left her to the care
of General <HI>Com,</HI> who succeeded him in his charge. The
Girl was fair and left rich, so that her Father was no sooner
gone, but she had many Suitors that courted her, without
any consideration of her Birth, among all which there was
none that she fancied, like one that was a Superior Merchant
of the Fort, for whom she had a particular esteem. Nei∣ther
did she believe but that General <HI>Com</HI> would have given
his consent upon the first request, knowing the young man
to be of a good Family. Nevertheless they were both de∣ceiv'd;
for being ask'd, he utterly denied to yield to any
<PB N="84" REF="66"/>
such matter. However, the young Man and the Maid con∣tinued
their Fidelity to each other, and that with such a close
respect, that at length the Virgin's Belly began to swell.
Whereupon she made one of the Ladies of the City acquaint∣ed
how the case stood, as also of her Council, believing
that the General upon notice how Affairs went, would mar∣ry
her to keep all things private. But so soon as the Lady
had revealed the Mystery, he was so far from answering
their expectation, that he threw the young Man laden
with Fetters into prison, and shut up the young Woman close
Prisoner in her Chamber. Next day he call'd a Council,
declar'd to them the Matter of Fact, and gave his Opinion,
that the young man deserv'd to lose his Head, and that the
Maid should be whipp'd. The Council were of a contrary
Judgment, and advis'd him to reconcile the Mischance by a
Marriage. But notwithstanding all their persuasions the
General resolv'd to have his own humour, the next day pri∣vately
sent for the Executioner, and causing the young Man
and the Maid to be brought into his Hall, commanded the
Man's Head to be forthwith struck off, and the Virgin to be
whipp'd though big with Child.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>Goyre</HI> commanded the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet that was
sent to the <HI>Manilles,</HI> he landed all his Souldiers, and most
of his Mariners. When they began to march, he command∣ed
that not a man should stir out of his Rank upon pain of
death. It happen'd that a young Souldier, who was troub∣led
with the Bloudy Flux, stept a little aside to ease Nature,
which the said Commander perceiving, caus'd him to be ap∣prehended
and bound, and calling a Council of War would
have had him hang'd; and when the Officers refus'd to give
Sentence against one that had committed no offence, he cau∣sed
seven or eight Blacks of the Low Countries to hang him
up upon a Tree. But the Sieur <HI>Dirk Hogel,</HI> Lieutenant Gene∣ral,
marching by in the nick of time, and seeing the poor Fel∣low
in that condition, presently order'd him to be cut down,
and so sav'd the poor Fellow's Life; who returning into

Directors wrote smartly to the General and Council at <HI>Ba∣tavia</HI>
about the business; who upon Examination of the
matter, in regard the Lad was sent by the Directors of the

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Touching the Women.</HEAD>
<P>OFttimes when Women think that their Amours are
most secret, they are by some strange and unexpect∣ed
accident odly discover'd. While I was at <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI>
the Secretary of the Hospital, as handsom a person as
any was in the City, had a Wife that pass'd for a <HI>Batavian</HI>
Beauty, neither indeed was she despicable. This Couple
had been seven years married without any Children; so
that the Woman despairing of her Husband's Abilities, and
to know where the fault lay, resolved to bestow her Fa∣vours
upon one of her Slaves, who was well shap'd but ve∣ry
black; chusing rather a private Familiarity with him, than
with any young <HI>Hollander,</HI> whose frequent Visits might
breed suspicion. It seems the fault did not lie in her, for
her Sable Gallant had so improv'd his Talent, that in a short
time she found the effects of Change. In short, the Wo∣mans
Belly swell'd, and her Husband thinking his time had
been come, began to boast of his Manhood, and great Joy
there was among the Friends of the Woman upon the hopes
of Issue. Great Provisions were made against the Lying in,
and the General himself made choice of for Godfather. But
when the good hour was come, and the Woman delivered,
their Joy was turned into Mourning, for the Child prov'd
one of the sooty Of-spring of the Sun-burnt race, a perfect
Black. The Husband and Mother of the Woman blush'd as
red for shame as the Child was black, and the Gossips hung
down their heads like Bulrushes: nay the Husband was so
transported with fury, that he could not hide his resolution
to murder his Wife, for bringing such a piece of live Char∣cole
into the world. But he was prevented, and secur'd in
the Fort by the General, till by the intermission of Friends,
who wisely laid before him the original cause of his Wifes
<PB N="86" REF="67"/>
Transgression, they were at length made Friends, and the
Slave for having shew'd himself a Man, was condemn'd to
tug at the Oars in the Galleys that go to fetch Stone for the
use of the City.</P>
<P>Now as a White Woman may bring forth a Black, so
sometimes a Black may be deliver'd of a White Child. For
at <HI>Baçaim</HI> a <HI>Cafer</HI>'s Wife, as black as himself, was deli∣ver'd
of a white Child. The <HI>Cafer</HI> seeing his Child white,
would have immediately fallen upon his Wife and strangled
her, had not the good women that assisted at her Labour
prevented him, and one of those Gossips was so cunning as
to run to the Jesuits House, who are well respected by
those Blacks, to desire Father <HI>Thomas de Bare,</HI> who had a
long time been Rector at <HI>Agra,</HI> to come to the <HI>Cafer</HI>'s House.
Presently the Father came with another of the Fraternity,
and finding the <HI>Cafer</HI> stamping and staring almost out of
his wits, and in open hostility without all reason, to ap∣pease
his fury ask'd him whether he kept any Hens, and
whether he had any that were black. The <HI>Cafer</HI> answer'd
that he did keep Hens, and that he had likewise black Hens.
Presently the Father order'd one to be brought him; and
then holding it in both his hands before the good Women,
Does this Hen (said he to the <HI>Cafer</HI>) lay thee any Eggs?
Yes, replied the <HI>Cafer.</HI> Of what colour are they, said the
Father? White, answer'd the <HI>Cafer.</HI> Well then, said the
Father, thou art worse than thy silly Creature, and hast far
less reason; for if this Hen which is black lay thee white
Eggs, why may not thy Wife which is black bring thee a
white Child? This Comparison so wrought upon the
<HI>Cafer,</HI> who was no Disputant, that he embrac'd his Wife,
kiss'd his Child, and all was well again. Though for all
the Jesuit's Comparison it was believ'd that some <HI>Portugal</HI>
Souldier had quarter'd with his Wife, which was the reason
of that more than usual Production.</P>
<P>To conclude, there was a certain woman, the wife of
one of the Counsellors of <HI>Batavia,</HI> who had both kindness
and affection for a Merchant of the Fort, who was both
young and handsom. And it is the Custom in that Coun∣trey
to be not onely kind but free, she had for several years
so well supplied his wants, that he was Company for the
best. It happen'd that this Counsellor was sent abroad up∣on
<PB N="87" REF="67"/>
some Negotiation, and staid longer than he thought he
should have done. For this reason Money grew short with
the Lady; so that her Gallant coming for a Supply, and she
not having ready money to answer his Expectations, she
gave him a Gold Chain worth 400 Crowns to pawn for his
present Necessities till she could redeem it. But this Fatal
Chain was the dissolution of all their former Love: For the
young Gentleman being streighten'd for Money, and find∣ing
no person that would lend him so much Money as he
wanted upon it, very fairly goes and offers it to a Goldsmith
to sell. While this unfortunate Lover was driving his Bar∣gain
in the Shop, who in the name of ill luck should come
by but one of his Mistresses Slaves, and spying the Chain in
his hand, runs and tells her Patroness how she had seen her
Gallant imploy'd. Who surpriz'd that her Gallant should
go about to sell the Chain, when he had onely promis'd to
pawn it in private and sure hands; now (quoth she) all will
out, there will be the Devil upon Dun when my Husband
comes home; and I forsooth that have liv'd credibly thus
long, must be the sport of my Neighbours and the talk of
the Town. This produc'd a Duel between Love and In∣terest,
wherein Interest getting the victory, away she im∣mediately
sends to all the Goldsmiths, to give them notice
that she had been robb'd of a Gold Chain, desiring them to
apprehend the Party that brought it. She also gave the same
notice to the chief of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and desir'd the Advocate
Fiscal to make a public Search. Well, by these means the
Chain was quickly found, and the Merchant whatever he
could say for himself was apprehended and put in prison;
soon after he was condemned for a Thief, and sentenced to
row all his life in the Stone Galley, which is the Galley
that fetches Stones for the use of <HI>Batavia.</HI> But happy for
him, General <HI>Vanderlin</HI>'s Lady falling into a hard Labour
before the time of Execution, and desiring his Pardon at
such a solemn Juncture, easily obtain'd it, seasonably reco∣vering
him from the Misfortunes of Folly and Necessity.</P>

from the Relations of certain Mer∣chants
who have traded in those
Countries. But in regard there are
very few Merchants who are skilful
in <HI>Geography,</HI> as being such who only
mind the profit and advantage of

it is no less imperfect; and it is but
only by conjecture to this day, that we believe the <HI>Abadii</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy</HI>
to be that Island which is now call'd <HI>Niphon.</HI> That which I could learn
of most certainty, was by the Relation of several persons who have
Travell'd these parts, that the Empire of <HI>Japon</HI> is at present compos'd
of several Islands, of which some perhaps may not be absolute Islands,
but rather <HI>Peninsula's,</HI> and particularly those that make a part of the

Through all the Islands of <HI>Japon,</HI> where formerly were accompted to

say farther, that this Country of <HI>Yesso,</HI> in those parts which are remote
from the Sea, is so full of inaccessible Mountains, that those <HI>Japonners</HI>
who have attempted a discovery by Land, could never accomplish their
design, being discourag'd by the length of the Journey, and the
difficulties and badness of the ways.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Niphon</HI> is four times as big as the other two; and there
is also a Mountain therein that vomits up Flames of Fire, like Mount
<HI>Etna</HI> in <HI>Sicily;</HI> formerly it was distinguish'd into thirty five Kingdoms,
but at this day it is only divided into five parts, the names whereof are
<HI>Jamasoit, Jetsen, Jetsesen, Quanto,</HI> and <HI>Ochio,</HI> lying all in order as you
travel from West to East. These five parts are again divided into
several Provinces. The Island of <HI>Ximo,</HI> or <HI>Saycock,</HI> is situated to the
South-West of <HI>Niphon,</HI> being about 160 Leagues in circuit. The Island
of <HI>Xicock</HI> is seated by the South of <HI>Niphon,</HI> being about 120 Leagues in
compass. The other Islands that lye round about are not so considerable,
for in those Seas lye several Islands scatter'd up and down, as in the <HI>Archi∣pelago,</HI>
between the <HI>Morea</HI> and the Coasts of <HI>Asia</HI> the less. As to the
rest, I refer the Reader to the Map annexed, believing it to be very
true, as having been made upon the places themselves.</P>
<P>The Emperour at present keeps his Court in the City of <HI>Yeddo,</HI> in
regard the Air is there more temperate, and the Heats not so violent;
but when he has a Son that is arriv'd to the Age of fifteen years, he
sends him to <HI>Surunga,</HI> there to reside, till the death of his Father makes
him way to the Throne.</P>
<P>Since <HI>Yeddo</HI> has been made choice of for the Seat of the Empire, it
has so greatly enlarg'd it self from day to day, that it is at present three
Leagues in length, and three in breadth, very populous, and the Houses
standing very close together. When the Emperour rides through the
City, or that there is any publick shew to be seen, it is impossible to get
by the crowd of the people, though the Women are not permitted to be
of the number. The Emperours Palace is cover'd with Plates of Gold,
to which the Palaces of the Lords are every way correspondent in Mag∣nificence;
so that afar off the City affords the richest and most magnifi∣cent
Prospect that was ever beheld: Though it be not so beautiful
within, by reason that the ordinary Houses are built only of Wood.
The Great <HI>Dairy</HI> keeps his residence at <HI>Meaco,</HI> which is also a very large
City, containing above a hundred thousand Houses; it was formerly
the capital Seat of the Empire, at what time the <HI>Dairy</HI>'s were laid aside.
So soon as he is Crown'd by the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> who are the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI>
he is then no more to expose himself to the light of the Moon, nor to
<PB N="3" REF="69"/>
shave his Head, or cut his Nails. The Natives report, that the Empire
of <HI>Japon</HI> was formerly govern'd by a Prince call'd <HI>Dairy,</HI> who had
acquir'd so high a reputation for Holiness, that his Subjects ador'd him
as a God, and that to increase the awe and reverence of the people, he
suffer'd his Hair and Nails to grow, affirming, that it it was a piece of
Sacriledge to make use either of Razor or Sizzars. The Princes
that succeeded him, though they had only the name of Kings, have
still preserv'd the same custom, believing that it becomes not their Gran∣deur
to appear in view of the Moon, as being Sons of the <HI>Sun.</HI> If he
have a Daughter that is ripe for Marriage, the Emperour is oblig'd to
Marry her, and she it is that bears the Title of Empress, though she
should happen to have no Children, which is contrary to the Maxims
of all the Eastern Monarchs, who give the Title of Queen and Sulta∣ness
only to her, among all the rest of their Wives, that is first brought
to Bed of a Male Successor to the Crown.</P>
<P>At the end of every seven years, the Emperour sends one of the chief
Princes of his Court to the <HI>Dairy</HI> with a Basket full of Earth, and to
tell him, that all the Lands which the Emperour commands, are at the
<HI>Dairy</HI>'s Devotion; and indeed the Empire belongs to him by right of
Succession, though at present he enjoys only the Title, and very large
Revenues, which render him highly considerable in the Empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japonners</HI> are Idolaters, and adore the Sun; but though they have
a great number of Temples and different Idols, yet they are not over
obstinate in their Devotion, only the Emperour is very severe against
all other Religions. They never stir out of their Native Country to
travel, unless it be to <HI>China,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Yesso;</HI> and within these
few years the Emperour has prohibited his people under extream penal∣ties,
from having any Commerce with Foreigners, the <HI>Chineses</HI> and
<HI>Hollanders</HI> excepted. He had receiv'd Ambassadours at several times
from several Princes, but never sent any of his own to them again.
Nevertheless it is affirm'd, that several Lords of these Islands newly
converted to the Faith, in the year 1585, sent their Children to <HI>Rome,</HI>
to render their acknowledgments to <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thirteenth; and that
being return'd back in the year 1587, to <HI>Goa,</HI> they were afterwards
receiv'd, and welcom'd again into their own Country with great marks
of joy. The little inclination which they have to Navigation and
Traffick, proceeds in part from the great abundance of all things neces∣sary
for Human support, which their own Country produces; and then
in the next place from the jealousies of the Emperour, who is afraid of
the alterations which new Religions may make in his Government;
for they are very fickle, and easily seduc'd after Novelties, which has been
the occasion of many Revolts, and Civil Wars, till <HI>Quabacondon</HI> wrested
the Empire out of the hands of the <HI>Dairy;</HI> and reunited all the Provinces.
They are so fiery and revengeful, that upon the least affront given them,
if they cannot have an opportunity of a present revenge, they will rip
up their own Bellies, and kill themselves. I was told a Story to confirm
this. Two young Lords that serv'd the Emperour met in the
Palace, and jostl'd one the other by accident; the most furious of the
two was immediately for drawing his Sword. The other told him, the
place was not convenient, that he was going to wait; but that if he
would stay for him in such a place, he would give him satisfaction.
Accordingly the party that thought himself affronted went and stay'd, but
<PB N="4" REF="70"/>
his impatience was such, that after he had stay'd a while, not finding
the other to come, he ripp'd up his own Bowels for very vexation.
Upon which the people crowding about him, ask'd him the reason of
his killing himself; to which they could draw no other answer but this,
<HI>A cowardly Raskal has affronted me.</HI> By and by the other comes, makes
way through the throng, and surpriz'd with what he beheld; <HI>Poor
Creature,</HI> said he, <HI>thou need'st not have doubted my being as good as my word,
this Dagger shall assure thee of it:</HI> And so saying, he kill'd himself upon
the place, and fell by the others side.</P>
<P>There is no Nation under Heaven that fears Death less than this, or
that is more enclin'd to cruelty. If any Prince or great Lord makes a
Feast for his Friends, at the end of the Feast he calls his principal Offi∣cers,
and asks 'em, if there be any that has so much love for him as to
kill himself before the Guests for his sake. Presently there arises a
dispute among them who shall have the Honour; and who ever the
Prince is pleas'd to name, rips up his Belly with a <HI>Cric,</HI> which is a kind
of Dagger, the poynt whereof is Poyson'd. This custom is also
practis'd upon the Death of their Masters, or when they lay the Foun∣dations
of any Palace; for they are so superstitious as to believe, that
these Victims are necessary to render both the Owners of the Building,
and the Habitation fortunate.</P>
<P>They punish all manner of Theft with Death. 'Tis also a capital
Crime among them to play for Money. Adultery is only punish'd in
the Women: But Coynage of false Money, setting Houses on Fire,
Deflowring and Ravishing of Virgins, are not only punish'd in the persons
of the Criminals, but also of those who are next of kin to them. The
Women live retir'd, and are very faithful to their Husbands. The
Emperour having put to Death one of the Lords of his Court, out of
hopes to enjoy his Wife; she fearing violence, besought the Emperour
to give her time to consider, which was granted for some few days.
At the end whereof she shut her self up in a Room with her Children;
and after she had delivered a Paper to one of her Servants to carry to the
Emperour, she set the Chamber a Fire, and burnt both her self and her
Children. The Emperour met with nothing else in the Paper but
reproaches of his Tyranny, and attestations of joy from the Lady, that
she had the opportunity to Sacrifice her self to the memory of her Hus∣band.
Several other stories I have heard, which make me believe,
that this Nation is not uncapable of doing actions worthy a <HI>Roman</HI>
Vertue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> were the first people of <HI>Europe</HI> that discover'd the Islands
of <HI>Japon.</HI> They were thrown upon the Coast by a violent Storm, in
the year 1542, and understanding that there was great store of Gold
and Silver in the Country, they return'd with a resolution to settle them∣selves.
The first place where they thought to fix was neer <HI>Surunga,</HI> a
City which stands about four Leagues from the Sea: But because there
is but one Road, and that not very secure neither for Shipping, they
remain'd there not above five years. At length they took possession of
a little forsaken Island call'd <HI>Kisma,</HI> which they peopl'd afterward's;
but since the last Persecution of the Christians, the <HI>Portugals</HI> were forc'd
to abandon it, having no more Commerce with the <HI>Japonners.</HI> How the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> came to erect their Factories there, I shall tell the Reader in
another part of this Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="70"/>
Seven years after the first coming of the <HI>Portugals</HI> to <HI>Japon,</HI> St. <HI>Francis
Xavier</HI> made a Voyage thither to Preach the Gospel. The first place where
he Landed was the Island of <HI>Niphon,</HI> where he stay'd two years and some
Months, and travel'd several parts of these Islands; but his principal
design being to go to <HI>China,</HI> he took shipping accordingly. The Vessel
was no sooner out at Sea, but St. <HI>Francis</HI> fell sick, so that the Captain
put him ashore again in the Island of <HI>Sechen,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Haynan,</HI>
belonging to <HI>China,</HI> where in a few days after he dy'd, and never was
in <HI>China,</HI> as some have reported and believ'd.</P>
<P>After his death the Christian Religion spread it self very much in
<HI>China,</HI> the people being very docible, and apprehensive of the instructions
which were given them, but the behaviour of the <HI>Portugals</HI> displeasing
the Principal Governours, and those who had most Power at Court,
they did them ill Offices to the Emperour, and the <HI>Bonzes</HI> misliking the
new Religion, and jealous of the effects thereof, were the fomenters of
continual persecutions against the new Converts, pretending they
favour'd the designs of the <HI>Portugueses.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless the Christian Religion daily got footing, and perhaps the
whole Nation would have embrac'd it, if the covetousness and wicked∣ness
of the Christians themselves had not been the chief impediment
of their conversion. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> did all they could to lay the fault
upon the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but the truth will easily appear by the Letter written
to one <HI>Leonard Campen,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI> wherein it is said, that when the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> were ask'd by the Natives what Religion they were of, they
made this answer, <HI>We are no Christians, we are</HI> Hollanders. I do not go
about to blemish a whole Nation for the fault of a few, but only to
shew what a dangerous thing it is, to make an ill choice of Officers upon
the setling of a new Commerce in Regions so remote.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holland East-India</HI> Company having set out a Vessel for <HI>Batavia,</HI>
put aboard about a dozen young Boys, and as many Girls, taken out of
the Hospitals in the Country. Among these Boys there was one who
was design'd to serve in the Kitchin, but Fortune made him an Instru∣ment
of one of the greatest Misfortunes that ever befell our Age.
During the Voyage, the Merchant having observ'd him to be a Boy of
a ready wit, and for that reason believing that he might one day prove ser∣viceable
to the <HI>Holland</HI> Company, caus'd him to be taught to write and
read; wherein he improv'd so well in a short time, that being come to
<HI>Batavia,</HI> he was thought capable of a higher Employment. The Vessel
being arriv'd, the General and his Council resolv'd to send the same Vessel
to <HI>Japon,</HI> with some part of the Lading which was brought from <HI>Europe.</HI>
Thereupon the Merchant was commanded upon this Voyage, and the
under Accomptant happening in the mean time to dye, this Boy was by
him advanc'd to the place, and by the Merchant carefully instructed in
the knowledge of the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>The Vessel being arriv'd at Firanda, the new under Accomptant
believing no place more proper for him them that to raise his fortune,
resolv'd to leave his Benefactor, and therefore when the Ship was to
return, he hid himself out of the way, till he knew the Ship to be far
enough on word on her Voyage, and by that means becoming a Member
of the Factory, he grew so perfect in the Language of the Natives,
and so useful to the Company, that do length. He came to be President
of the Factory; the Authority of which Employment so puff'd him
<PB N="6" REF="71"/>
up, that he was not only for continuing and upholding the Commerce
of his own, but excluding all other Nations. Now, as I have already
observ'd, the <HI>Portugals</HI> were the first Traders, and the first that propa∣gated
the Christian Religion in those parts; therefore it was that the
Christian <HI>Japonners</HI> would not Trade with any but the <HI>Portugals,</HI> as
having known them longer, and finding them more true to their words.
This the President observ'd, and made it his business to render them
obnoxious at Court, and by vertue of his Presents, engag'd the Gover∣nours
of Provinces, and other great Lords, to favour his design.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Portugals</HI> wanted neither friends nor confederates. And
though they were not in a condition to be so liberal as the President, yet
they made ashift to defend themselves, and render his under hand
Dealings ineffectual. Thereupon finding that those Tricks would
not take, he had recourse to the foulest of Calumnies; for he counter∣feited
a Letter written in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Language, containing a disco∣very
of a design of the Christian <HI>Japonners</HI> to have made a general In∣surrection,
and a particular Conspiracy against the person of the Em∣perour.
This Letter he carry'd to a Lord of the Country, into whose
favour and confidence he had wrought himself, who presently thought
it to be his duty to give intelligence of so important a design to the
Court.</P>
<P>The President inform'd him by what accident the Letter came to his
hands, and gave an account of such circumstances, as made his Impo∣sture
look with a probable countenance, relating, how that the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
had taken a <HI>Portugal</HI> Vessel returning from <HI>Japon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> and that
the <HI>Holland</HI> Captain having taken this Letter among other Papers, open'd
it, and perceiving of what consequence it was, had sent an Express to
the President to proceed as his prudence, and the affection of the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Company toward the Emperour should guide him. That the <HI>Portugals,</HI>
who were but Subjects to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had a pernicious Maxim, not to
suffer any Religon but their own in any place where they had to do,
and that for their own ends they never spar'd either the Life or Liberty
of Man; that they thought it an acceptable Sacrifice to God, to cut the
Throats of those whom they could not convert. And lastly, that the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> were a people that accorded with all Nations and Religions,
and minded nothing but their Trade.</P>
<P>The Lord believ'd all these fraudulent Calumnies, and sent a Copy
of the Letter to the Emperour, the substance whereof was, That the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Japon,</HI> being in
confederacy with the Christians of the Country, had sent to the Gover∣nour
of <HI>Goa</HI> to send by a time prefix'd eight or ten Vessels, with Men
and Arms, but especially a good number of Officers to command the
Revolters, for that then there would be a numerous Army ready, and
that they should easily make themselves Masters of <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> were then under the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and
though they would suffer no <HI>Spaniard</HI> in their <HI>Indian</HI> Acquisitions but
the Viceroy, yet several of the Religious Orders did slip into <HI>Japon;</HI>
carried thither by a true and real zeal; yet this zeal, when once indis∣creet,
does as much mischief as covetousness it self. The Father <HI>Pau∣lists,</HI>
for so they call the <HI>Jesuits</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by reason that their Church
in <HI>Goa</HI> is dedicated to St. <HI>Paul;</HI> these <HI>Jesuits</HI> I say, had made a fair pro∣gress,
and gain'd great credit among the people, notwhithstanding
<PB N="7" REF="71"/>
their continual persecutions, according as the Lords of the Country
were well or ill affected towards them. Their number therefore
encreas'd, and the new Converts had this advantage, that they enrich'd
themselves by Trading with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who had made a positive
Agreement not to Trade with the <HI>Bonzes.</HI> This provok'd the <HI>Bonzes</HI>
against them, and the multitude of the Christians so far augmented
the Emperour's jealousies and fears, that in a short time they produc'd
the effects of open rage and cruelty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> had converted to the Faith a great Lord of the Kingdom,
who liv'd most commonly at <HI>Bugen,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Ximo,</HI> a person of
great Interest and Power in the Island. He had four Sons, two of
which liv'd with him, and following his Example, had embrac'd the
Catholick Faith. The Father was Baptiz'd by the name of <HI>Ignatius;</HI>
the eldest of the two was call'd <HI>Francis,</HI> and the youngest <HI>Charles:</HI> the
two eldest Sons were at Court in great favour with the Emperour. The
younger of the two that had embrac'd the Christian Religion, ad∣dicted
himself wholly to the study of the Scripture, and retir'd with
the <HI>Jesuits</HI> to their Seminary. His Example had wrought with a great
number of young Lords, and as he was eloquent besides, he was of
great use to the <HI>Jesuits</HI> in preaching the Gospel, and reclaiming the people
from the grossness of their Errors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japonners</HI> are naturally endow'd with a noble mind, and great
inclination to Learning; so that there is nothing wanting in that Nation
but able Teachers. Not but that they have Doctors of their own: the
<HI>Dairy</HI>'s Court is full of them; where they preserve the Annals of their
Country, and pretend that Printing and Artillery were in use among
them before they were known in <HI>Europe.</HI> From this Court come all
their Books, in regard the persons that attend upon this Prince apply
themselves only to their Studies. It is reported, that they learnt all these
things by their frequent Commerce with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and that they are
also originally descended from them. And in truth, the greatest Pro∣vince
of the Island of <HI>Niphon</HI> is call'd <HI>Quanto,</HI> according to the name
of the Sea-Coast part of <HI>China,</HI> where lies the greatest Traffick be∣tween
the <HI>Japonners</HI> and <HI>Chineses.</HI> Moreover, if there be any credit to
be given to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Histories, they say it was but a small part of their
vast-Empire, which extended it self from North to South 56 Degrees
of Latitude, from the Frozen Sea to the Equinoctial Line, being boun∣ded
to the West by the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and extending Eastward over all
the Southern <HI>America</HI> to <HI>New Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Father <HI>Thomas Barr,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> has often told me when I was at
<HI>Agra,</HI> a capital City of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> where the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have a very
fair House, that this and several other young Lords improv'd
themselves so far in six or seven years, that they were as Learned as their
Masters themselves, and that they were more zealous in converting
those of their Nation. Now the <HI>Jesuits</HI> at that time had no House for
the Instruction of Youth and Proselytes, and therefore they desir'd this
young Lord to lend them one of his. Thereupon he having four very
fair ones, with great Revenues belonging to them, gave that which
was nearest to the City to his Converters. A while after, the youngest
of his Sons fell sick, and was carried to this House for the Air's sake,
where he recover'd by the care of the Fathers, and the Prayers of the
Christians; but his Father did not long enjoy the pleasure of so great
<PB N="8" REF="72"/>
a Cure, which seem'd almost miraculous; for he dy'd at what time both
his Sons and the Christians stood most in need of his protection.</P>
<P>The two eldest, who were with the Emperour, understanding the
the Death of their Father, came to take possession of their Inheritance,
and demanded of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> the House which their Father had given
them, for in <HI>Japon</HI> no Parent can alienate the Estate of his Children;
nay, when they come to such an Age, he is oblig'd to put them in
possession of their Estates, reserving only such a proportion to himself.
The <HI>Jesuits,</HI> loth to part with so fair a convenience, would not quit their
hold, though it were for their own quiet, and to engage the whole
Family to stand by them in their time of trouble. This refusal pro∣vok'd
the two Brethren, and this quarrel between them and the <HI>Jesuits</HI>
happen'd at the same time that the <HI>Dutch</HI> President was labouring to
bring about his designs. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d notice of this dispute, and as he was
a great Impostor, he made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his business to enflame the two Brothers,
not only against the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> but against the <HI>Portugals</HI> in general, giving
them a Copy of the Letter which he had fram'd, as is before-men∣tion'd.</P>
<P>These two Lords, who were Favourites of the Emperour, joyning
Interest of State to their particular Interest, made their complaints at
Court, with extraordinary aggravations; urging that there was no
security for the Estates of particular Men, for the quiet of the Empire,
nor the Life of the Prince, unless not only all the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but also all
the Natives of <HI>Japon,</HI> who had suck'd their Errors, were exterminated
out of the Island. To make good the reasons of their Exasperation they
shew'd the Emperour a Copy of the Letter, and put him into such
a fright, as well for his Person, as the Empire, that he would admit of
no justification on the other side.</P>
<P>Some of his Lords, who were Friends to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> besought him
to examin the truth of what was alledg'd, before he proceeded to utmost
extremities against a whole Nation, and against his own Subjects.
But he was inexorable, and presently gave private Orders to certain
Commissioners, to go through all the Provinces of the Empire, and
to banish not only the <HI>Portugals,</HI> but also all the Christian Natives. Now
in regard they had their private confederates, as well in the Court, as
in other places, they had intelligence, in all parts, of the cruel resolution
tak'n against them, though none were more zealous and faithful to
them then the two Lords of <HI>Ximo, Francis</HI> and <HI>Charles.</HI> Thereupon
the Christians met together to consult for their own safety, and their
common preservation, and seeing all attempts to justifie themselves
prove ineffectual, they resolv'd to stand upon their guards, and to dye
in the defence of their Innocency and Religion. The two Lords put
themselves at the head of the Christians Army, the elder of which had
been a Souldier, and understood the Art of War; the younger kept up
their Spirits and Courages by his continual Exhortations.</P>
<P>The Emperour's Commissioners understanding that the Christians
were thus embody'd, gave him speedy notice thereof, but said nothing
either of the number of their Forces, or of their designs. The <HI>Jesuits</HI>
and <HI>Austin Fryars</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> told me, that the Army of the Christians con∣sisted
of above 40000 Men, besides those recruits that came up to them
before and after the Battel was fought.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="72"/>
The Emperour not beleiving that the Army was so numerous, sent
against them at first not above 25 or 30000 Men, under the Com∣mand
of the youngest of the two Lords of <HI>Ximo,</HI> that liv'd at
Court. But those Troops were no sooner upon their March, but
he rais'd new Forces, and sent another Army after them, consisting of
40000 Men, commanded by the young Lord, to whom the <HI>Dutch</HI>
President had shew'd the Letter first of all.</P>
<P>The Christians having intelligence of the approach of these two
Armies, prepar'd to receive them, choosing an advantagious place to
intrench themselves. The first Army soon appear'd in sight of the
Christians, who lay so encamp'd, that the Imperialists could discover
no more than one part of them. However, before the Engagement,
the youngest of the Christian Brothers advis'd his other Brother to send to
the General of the Emperour's Army, who was their Brother likewise, to
desire Peace, and to beseech him to intercede for them to the Emperour,
and to assure him, that they were ready to lay down their Arms, and
throw themselves at his Feet, and to justifie their Innocency. To this
purpose a Letter was fram'd and sent to the General, but the Messenger
that carry'd it was nail'd to a Cross in sight of the whole Army of the
Christians, and at the same time the Enemy came on with great fury to
assail them.</P>
<P>The Fight lasted almost three hours with equal advantage; the Cap∣tain
of the Imperialists seeking every where for his Brothers, while they
strove to avoid him. The Christians, who knew that all their safety
consisted in their Victory, and that there was otherwise no hope of par∣don,
fought with so much valour; that the Imperialists were forc'd to
give ground. Their General was slain upon the place, and at length
the whole Army of the Idolaters was cut in pieces.</P>
<P>This Victory wrought the Conversion of several of the Idolaters;
and the Christians, after they had given thanks to God three days toge∣ther,
prepar'd themselves for a second Combat, not doubting but the
other Army would set upon them while they were weary, and weaken'd
by the last Battel. But that General more prudent then the former, only
posted himself where the Christians could not come at him, and writ
to the Court the particulars of the Defeat of the first Army, upon which
he expected the Emperour's Orders.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Army of the Christians daily encreas'd, so that
in a few days they were above fifty thousand strong. The Emperour,
resolv'd to stifle this Revolt in the beginning, sent Orders through all
his Empire to make new Levies; and all the while the <HI>Dutch</HI> President's
Confederates ceas'd not to aggravate him against the Christians, not
suffering the other Courtiers to open his Eyes, and prevent so unjust a
prosecution. The defeat of his Army had put him into such a rage be∣sides,
that though the Captains of the Christians Army did all they
could to clear themselves from the false accusations laid upon them, and
to obtain their pardons, there was no possibility of being heard.</P>
<P>The Emperour call'd his Council, where the wisest were of opinion,
that it would prove the best way to receive the submissions of the Chri∣stians,
who offer'd to lay down their Arms upon a general pardon, and
the free exercise of their Religion. But the President's Cabal carry'd it
beyond this sober advice, and the Emperour, exasperated by his Impo∣stures,
took the wrong course. Thereupon the Council resolv'd with

all speed to raise a vast Army, which was to joyn with the other, and
so to ruin the Christians all at a blow. The <HI>Dairy</HI> also, who is con∣sulted
upon all important affairs, approv'd this Council. Thereupon
the Lords who are oblig'd to furnish the Emperour with Men, strove
who should bring their Troops and Companies first to the Randevouz
appointed, which was neer the place where the second Army lay; so
that when both Armies were joyn'd together, there was in the Field a
Body of 150000 Men. The Brother of the General, who was slain in
the first Battel, commanded under the Emperour, who resolv'd to go
in person.</P>
<P>But first of all he caus'd a Proclamation to be made in his Camp,
whereby he forbad any Quarter to be given to any Christian, unless it
were the two Brothers, whom he intended to punish openly; and that
they who left the Field before the Christians were banish'd, should be put,
they and their Kindred, to the most cruel Deaths that could be imagin'd;
but that they should be rewarded that brought the Head of a Christian
to the Emperour. The Copies of this Proclamation were scatter'd in
the Army of the Christians, though they did no harm but only encou∣rag'd
them against the Idolaters, seeing there was no hope of pardon.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the youngest of the two Brothers offer'd to go and throw
himself at the Emperour's Feet, to implore his clemency in the name of
the whole Army; saying withall, That he should accompt himself happy
to suffer Martyrdom to shew his Innocency; but they would not suffer
him to stir. All he could obtain from them, was to write a Letter full
of respect, submission, and repentance for what had been already done,
declaring that they were ready to lay down their Arms, if the Emperour
would grant them pardon, and the free Exercise of their Religion,
offering with the hazard of their Lives to make out the falsity of all
those things wherewith they had been accus'd.</P>
<P>This was by an Idolater carry'd to a certain Lord who secretly favour'd
the Christians; but the Emperour toar it without reading it, vowing
at the same time, that he would never return to his Court 'till the Idola∣ters
were all extirpated. The Christian Army understanding the Em∣perour's
resolution, minded nothing more then their own defence. 'Tis
true, the Ground where they lay was advantagious enough for the
smallness of their Number, but the Idolaters were three to one; besides
that the Idolaters of the Country, who favour'd the Christians before,
now declar'd all against them so soon as they saw the Imperial Army.
So that now both Armies lying so near together, several hot Skirmishes
pass'd between 'em; and at length it came to a general Battel. At first
the Christians overthrew the Idolaters, not able to stand before them:
with so much vigour did the youngest of their Chieftains assail them.
He was remarkable for his Habit that day, but more remarkable for his
courage; so that the Field was cover'd with the Bodies of the slain, fear
and dread possessing the yielding Enemy. But while the Victor forgot his
Brother's advice, and pursu'd too far from the Body of the Army, he
was encompass'd on every side, wounded, and being carried away by
the press of his Enemies, was at length taken, and lead before the
Emperour. His eldest Brother, more experienc'd in War, rally'd and
recall'd those that had follow'd his Brother, and till Night maintain'd
the advantages, which he had got over the Imperialists, who were still
supply'd with fresh Succours, as necessity requir'd. The next day the Fight
<PB N="11" REF="73"/>
was renew'd again by break of day, and with a success as honourable,
but more bloody to the Christians.</P>
<P>The third day the Emperour enrag'd at such a resistance, caus'd them
to be set upon in several places at one time. The General of the Chri∣stians
Army rode from Rank to Rank, encouraging the Souldiers both
by his Exhortations, and his Example: but at length having receiv'd
several wounds, he was overlaid by the multitude of his Enemies that
crouded to his destruction. And now the General being lost, and the
Christians having no person to command them, it ceas'd to be a Com∣bat,
and became a Massacre. However, resolving to dye with their
Swords in their hands, they flung themselves into the thickest of their
Enemies, and Sacrific'd themselves to their own Innocency. Their
Camp was soon forc'd, and all the old Men, Women, and Children
put to the Sword, except some few that escap'd and hid themselves in
the Mountains, who afterwards made a relation of this bloody Story to
them who rehears'd it to me.</P>
<P>This was the deplorable end of the Christians, and indeed of the
Christianisme of <HI>Japon,</HI> which the President procur'd by his impostures
and fallacies. And it has been made appear by three exact accompts, that
there has perish'd, either in Battels or by Tortures, above 60000 Chri∣stians.
The eldest of their Captains suffer'd a most cruel Martyrdom
for seven days, neither could any offer, that the Emperour could make
him for his Brothers and his own Valours sake, induce him to renounce
the Christian Faith. After that, there was a kind of Inquisition set up
thorough the whole Empire, which lasted for several years, whereby
those that persever'd in the Faith, were condemn'd to most intolerable
Torments, in so much that the Relation which <HI>Van Varen,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI>
whose credit it would be a vanity to question in this particular, cannot
be read over without Horrour. In sixteen years, that is, from 1613
to 1629, the Christians were so multiply'd, that there were above
400000; but in the year 1649, the same <HI>Hollander</HI> relates, that those
<HI>Japonners</HI> who were brought from thence by the Company's Ships to <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI>
affirm'd, that Christianity was utterly extirpated out of the
Island.</P>
<P>Being at <HI>Ogli,</HI> a large Town upon the fairest Arm of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> I
met a <HI>Holland</HI> Merchant, who had serv'd the Company in <HI>Japon</HI> a long
time and had made several Voyages. He came thither with two
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laden with Bars of Silver and Copper, which he had exchang'd
for Silks, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy at <HI>Bengale.</HI> This Merchant know∣ing
I was there, came to visit me; and I finding him to be a sincere
honest Man, and well verst in the affairs of <HI>Japan,</HI> especially in
reference to the last persecution of the Christians, grew cove∣tous
of his converse, and invited him often to my House. In our
familiar discourses concerning the settlement of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the
<HI>East-Indies,</HI> and of the extraordinary gain which they make by their
Trade there, and passing thus from one thing to another, at length I ask'd
him who was the Author and Contriver of a Massacre so horrid, as
that was reported to be. Whereupon he related to me all the particu∣lars
of which I have here made a recital, and many more which I have
forgot or omitted, as being either not pertinent to my subject, or else
already related by others. He had his information from such of the
Natives that had escap'd out of the Battel, and several of the Idolater
<PB N="12" REF="74"/>
Merchants, in whose memories the fact was then fresh: and indeed he
was so ingenious in his Story, that I could not find any motive to in∣cite
me to misdoubt the truth of it. For many times he could not for∣bear
shedding tears, and to interrupt his discourse with his sighs, often
imprecating Heav'ns Vengeance upon the President, and protesting
he wonder'd the Company employ'd him so long. But God reserv'd
his punishment to himself. For the deserts of his crimes always atten∣ding
him, and provoking judgments and misfortunes upon whatever
Enterprize he took in hand, he miserably perish'd in sight of <HI>Lisbon</HI> in
fair weather. All the men in the Ship were sav'd; only he returning
to recover a certain Cabinet of Jewels which he had there, the Ship
split, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> had the satisfaction to see him swallow'd up in the
Sea, who had been the occasion of the Ruin of so many of their
Country-men in <HI>Japon;</HI> and immediately they rang their Bells in the
City for joy of his Death.</P>
<P>In my last Voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI> I was at <HI>Bandar-Abassi,</HI> where the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> have a Factory. Thither arriv'd two Vessels from <HI>Japon</HI> to
take in Silks, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy of the <HI>Persians</HI> to exchange in
<HI>Japon.</HI> The Captain of one of the Ships told me, that during several
trading Voyages which he had made to that Island, the Emperour had
caus'd two Inquisitions to be made after the Christians; in the first of
which the Inquisitors met with 247, who were all most exquisitely
tormented to Death; in the latter they only found 63, among whom
were seventeen Children, twelve Girls and five Boys, of which the
eldest were not above thirteen years of Age.</P>
<P>Among all the persecutions which the Christians suffer'd, there was
none comparable to this for extremity of Torments: For the <HI>Japonners</HI>
are the most ingenious in cruelty of any people in the World, and the
most constant in suffering. For there have been Children from ten to
a dozen years old, who for 60 days together have endur'd to have their
Bodies fasten'd to the Cross, half burnt, half torn in pieces, while
their Executioners forc'd them to eat, on purpose to prolong their Lives
in misery; and yet they would not renounce the Faith which they had
embrac'd. Neither did this barbarous Inquisition extend only to the
Christians, but to their Kindred and Relations, nay, to their very
Neighbours. For if a Priest were taken in any House, all the people
in that House, and the Houses adjoyning, were hall'd to Execution,
for not having made the discovery.</P>
<P>At the beginning of every year there is a new Inquisition, at which
time all that can write are requir'd to subscribe, or else the chief of the
Family subscribes for all the rest, that they neither are Christians, nor
are acquainted with any Christians, and that they abominate Christianity
as a Religion dangerous to the State.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Braganza,</HI> being advanc'd to the Crown, that sudden
change which in one day, and without the least Tumult in <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
wrested the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> wrought the
same effect at <HI>Goa.</HI> All the <HI>Portugals</HI> at <HI>Goa</HI> at the same time acknow∣ledg'd
their new Soveraign; the Viceroy who was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was sent
away to <HI>Spain</HI> by the first Vessels that were homeward bound; and <HI>Don
Philip de Mascarennas,</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> Governour of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> came to <HI>Goa,</HI> and
took upon him the command of Viceroy.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="74"/>
So soon as he came to the Government, his first thoughts were how
to Establish the Trade of the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Japon,</HI> which when they were
expell'd, amounted to three Millions of <HI>Pardo's</HI> yearly, one <HI>Pardo</HI> being
worth twenty seven <HI>Sous</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. The hopes therefore of
regaining so great a loss, made him toward the end of the year 1642,
take a resolution to send a solemn Embassy to the Emperour of <HI>Japon,</HI> fur∣nish'd
with magnificent Presents: For which reason he made choice of
what was most rare, and most likely to be acceptable to the Emperour,
and the Grandees of his Court. The most costly of these Presents was
a piece of <HI>Lignum Aloes,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Wood of Calambour,</HI> four Foot
in length, and two Foot in Diameter; a larger piece then which the
<HI>Indies</HI> had never seen, having cost 40000 <HI>Parao's.</HI> To this he added a
great quantity of fair Coral Beads of an extraordinary bigness. This is
the most acceptable Present that can be sent to the Lords of <HI>Japon,</HI> which
they fasten to the Strings wherewith they draw their Pouches together.
With these he sent a great number of Carpets and Hangings of Cloth
of Gold, Silver, and Silk, and several pieces of Tissue of Gold and
Silver. 'Tis said the whole Present cost the City of <HI>Goa</HI> above eight
hundred thousand <HI>Pardo's,</HI> which amounts to about 86666 <HI>l. 13 s.
4 d.</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Money. Besides all this, the two great Ships which
were prepar'd for the Embassador, carry'd one of them 50 Peeces of
Canon, and the other 35, both laden with all sorts of Commodities
which are esteem'd and priz'd in <HI>Japon,</HI> amounting to about 83333 <HI>l. 6 s.
8 d.</HI> Sterling. The Equipage of the Embassador was no less sumptuous.
And because the Viceroy would not be thought to give any occasion of
offence to the Emperour, he would not suffer one <HI>Jesuit</HI> in the Train,
but only four <HI>Augustins</HI> for the Admiral, and four <HI>Jacobins</HI> for the other,
Men of discretion and conduct. While I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> in the year 1648,
I met with some of these Fathers, who gave an exact accompt of the
Embassy.</P>
<P>They made a prosperous Voyage, and arriv'd happily at their in∣tended
Port. But you must understand, that when any Ship arrives at
<HI>Japon,</HI> no persons are permitted to come ashore, 'till the Governour of
the place have an accompt who they are, that they may give notice
thereof to the Emperour, and know his pleasure, whether they shall be
received or no. In the mean time the Ships rode in a very dangerous
place, at the entry of the Haven, into which there was no steering,
without the assistance of the Native Pilots.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Nangasaqui</HI> surpriz'd to understand that they were
<HI>Portugueses,</HI> wrote in all hast to the Emperour. The <HI>Dutch</HI> President
being inform'd of the news, play'd all the pranks he could, us'd all the
contrivances imaginable to frustrate the success of the Embassy, and
to ruine the Vessels that brought the Embassadour and his Presents.
To which purpose he found a way to bribe the Courrier, who was sent
with the Emperours Orders; so that instead of twenty days, which
were sufficient for his journey, he made it above two Months before he
deliver'd his dispatches. During which time the two Ships had suffer'd
very bad weather upon the Coasts, and endur'd many a severe Storm.
At length the Orders came that none should be permitted to Land but
the Embassadour, the two Captains, and the two Pilots, to give an
accompt of the subject and cause of their coming. The Embassadour
being Landed, acquainted the Governour that he came to compliment
<PB N="14" REF="75"/>
the Emperour in the behalf of the King his Master, and to assure him
that they were no longer under the Power of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> That
about a year since, a lawful Heir of <HI>Portugal</HI> had recover'd the Diadem
of his Ancestors which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had usurp'd. That this new King
was so just and generous a Prince, that understanding that some of his
Subjects had deserted the Island of <HI>Japon,</HI> without paying their Debts,
he had now sent to make a general satisfaction; but chiefly out of that
respect which obliges all Soveraigns newly come to the Crown, to give
notice thereof to those Princes, whose friendship they desire.</P>
<P>The Governour inform'd the Emperour of all these things; but the
President having as good intelligence by means of his Friends at Court,
alledg'd to the Emperour that they were Rebels, who came from the
utmost parts of the West, to bring the News and Example of their
Revolt to <HI>Japon:</HI> That the natural restlesness of this Nation caus'd fre∣quent
disturbances and revolutions among them. That they were never
long at rest themselves, nor would suffer others to be at quiet. That
considering the experience he had had, he could not be either too cau∣tious
for the security of his person, or the tranquillity of his Empire.
Lastly, that the Emperour and the Empire would be ruin'd past reco∣very,
if those people were ever admitted to set footing therein.</P>
<P>This Counsel well seconded by the rest of the Cabal, easily made an
impression in the Heart of the Prince naturally Barbarous, and an
Enemy to the Christians. Thereupon he sent an Order to the Gover∣nour
to invite all the <HI>Whites</HI> aboard, and to treat them for eight days in
the best manner he could. At the end of eight days they were order'd
to repair aboard again, and at the same time he made a Present to the
Embassadour, and chief of his Train, consisting of six great Cabinets,
and six Coffers lacker'd with black, with Figures in Relief, intermix'd
with spangles of Gold, all the Embellishments being of Massie Gold.
With them were six Cabinets, and six Coffers, lacker'd with Red,
Embellish'd after the same manner with Silver. I saw some of them
when I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> and I must confess I never beheld any so rare and
beautiful in that kind, which made me admire the ingenious Industry
of the Artists of <HI>Japon;</HI> Our <HI>European</HI> imitations of their workmanship
being no way comparable to them.</P>
<P>The Embassadour having receiv'd his Present, had Order to remove
all the Goods in the second Vessel into the Admiral. He would have
made great Presents to the Governour, who refus'd them; telling the
Embassadour withall, that he had express command to refuse them, and
to declare to the Embassadour, that if he did not make hast away, he
would sink his Ship. That the Emperour his Master had made a new
prohibition, forbidding all <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> to venture near his
Dominions upon any pretence whatsoever; nay, though it were upon
pretence of an Embassy, upon pain of being crucifi'd upon the place,
without liberty to speak for themselves. As for the Debts of the <HI>Portu∣gals,</HI>
he had undertaken to discharge them himself; only he had sent
that Present to the King his Master to thank him for that Embassy. The
Embassadour had no sooner remov'd the Goods out of the second Vessel
into the Admiral, but they sank her before his face. And not contented
with that affront, the Governour sent for all the Blacks that were in the
Admiral, and cut off their Heads, pretending they were <HI>Indians,</HI> and
that, as such, they could not be ignorant of the Rigorous prohibitions
<PB N="15" REF="75"/>
which the Emperour had put forth, forbidding all Strangers, except the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> to set footing in <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Portugal</HI> Embassadour was thus harbarously frustrated and
dismiss'd, he sent News thereof to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> urging him
to execute the design which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had upon <HI>Macao;</HI> telling him
also, That though there were a probability of a League between the
<HI>Hollander</HI> and the <HI>Portugal</HI> against the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> yet that it could be no
harm to seize <HI>Macao</HI> beforehand, as they had made themselves Masters
of several places, while the <HI>Portugals</HI> were under the King of <HI>Spain.</HI>
The General taking the President's advice, was ready to set Sail upon
this enterprize, when a Messenger from <HI>Portugal</HI> brought him the News
of the Treaty concluded between <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> as also of the
Navy which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had sent to <HI>Lisbon</HI> to aid the <HI>Portugals.</HI> At
first he made as if it had been a false Rumour, and put the Messenger in
Prison; nevertheless while he delay'd the departure of the Fleet, he
receiv'd express Orders from his Superiours to Treat the <HI>Portugals</HI> as
Friends and Allies. So that he was constrain'd to turn all his Forces
against the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, then in the possession of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The President was very sorry for the last News, by reason that the
General and he had great designs upon the Conquest of that place, and
had promis'd the Company by that means to make them absolute Masters
of the Trade of <HI>China,</HI> and of all the East. True it is, that <HI>Macao</HI> is
very advantagiously seated for those that design to be Masters of those
Seas, especially upon the Coasts of <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Fockien,</HI> which are
the Provinces, whither are brought down all the Merchandizes of this
Empire. It lies at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Canton,</HI> in a small
<HI>Peninsula</HI> adjoyning to a larger Island, and built upon a kind of a Pro∣montory,
on three sides environ'd with the Sea, which no Ship can
come neer by reason of the Flats, unless it be on that side next the Port,
which is defended by a strong Fortress. This City drew from the only
Fair of <HI>Quanchiu</HI> 1300 Chests of Silks of all sorts, every Chest con∣taining
150 pieces, and 2500 Lingots of Gold, not reckoning the raw
Silks, the Gold Wire, and other Merchandizes: whence it may be
easily judg'd what advantage the <HI>Portugueses</HI> made of it; and wherefore
the President desir'd so much to expell them from thence.</P>
<P>But his Designs were disappointed, not only by the revolution in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> but also by the loss which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> sustain'd of the Island
of <HI>Formosae,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> took from them, following the advice
of a <HI>French</HI> Souldier, whom the Governour of <HI>Tayovan</HI> had refus'd to
dismiss after his time was out. For the better understanding this
accident, you must know that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being setl'd in <HI>Japon,</HI> and
having excluded all other Nations from thence, except the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
whom the Emperour permitted to return, after that the Massacre com∣mitted
by the <HI>Japonners</HI> in a City of <HI>China,</HI> of which they had a desire
to make themselves Masters, had caus'd a Cessation of the Commerce
between the two Kingdoms, and constrain'd the Emperour of <HI>China</HI>
to set a price upon the Heads of the <HI>Japonners.</HI> Nevertheless the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI>
did all they could to make a new Rupture between the people, or
else themselves to seize upon some place that lay proper to ruin the Trade
of the <HI>Chineses</HI> to <HI>Japon.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpose, not daring to attempt upon the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> they
over-ran the Seas which environ'd the neighbouring Islands, and took
<PB N="16" REF="76"/>
the Vessels of the <HI>Chineses</HI> which were bound for <HI>Macao,</HI> exercising
strange Cruelties upon the people that had escap'd into those Islands,
after the irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> into <HI>China. Coxinga,</HI> the Son of
<HI>Chinchilunge,</HI> that famous Pirate, who sav'd the remainders of that
ruin'd Empire, then commanded those people, and was become formi∣dable
to the <HI>Tartars</HI> themselves. Who to revenge himself upon the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Pirates, undertook the Siege of <HI>Tayovan,</HI> where they usually
retir'd, and by gaining that place drave them wholly out of <HI>Formosa.</HI></P>
<P>This is a large Island plac'd at the poynt of the <HI>Phillippines,</HI> stretch∣ing
out in length from North to South, and to the West lying opposite
to the Provinces of <HI>Fockien,</HI> and <HI>Quantung.</HI> The <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>Tali∣eukieu.</HI>
Since which time, 'tis very probable that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave it
the name of <HI>Formosa,</HI> from its beauty and fertility. They being the
first people of <HI>Europe</HI> that discover'd it, and inhabited it; and upon one
of its Promontories to the North built the Fort of <HI>Kiling.</HI> The natu∣ral
Inhabitants live almost all in the Woods and Mountains, where they
maintain themselves by hunting the Hart, and wild Boar, whose dry'd
Flesh, Skins, and Horns they sell to the <HI>Sangleys,</HI> who in exchange
bring them other necessaries. The little Island of <HI>Tayovan</HI> lent its Name
to the little Fort which the <HI>English</HI> built, over against the great Island;
it was very convenient for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who made great advantage
of the Cattel, Hides, and Horns, both of Harts and Bufalo's, which
they carry'd from thence, and sold to the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Japonners,</HI> who make
great use thereof in several of their Trades and Manufactures. But the
chiefest advantage which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made of this Island consisted in
this, that it lay in the middle way between <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> and
serv'd as a place of security for their Ships in bad Seasons, and to take
in refreshments. There also they laded off several of the Goods of the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> which they took by way of Piracy from the <HI>Chineses,</HI> or which
were brought them by the <HI>Sangleys,</HI> who are the Original Merchants of
the <HI>Chineses,</HI> setled at the <HI>Philippines,</HI> but who drive the greatest Trade
of that Country, independent from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coxinga,</HI> though an Idolater and a Pirate, banish'd out of his Country,
and provok'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had so much humanity as to send to the
General at <HI>Batavia</HI> to send away Vessels to fetch away his Men, and de∣liver'd
them all without suffering them to receive the least injury. He
had his Friends and Favourers in the Emperour of <HI>Japon</HI>'s Court, as
being a declar'd Enemy to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> whose neer Neighbourhood the
<HI>Japonners</HI> cannot endure. For so quick a Conquest of so many Lands
and Provinces in seven years, as it were only upon sight of the Enemy,
had very much alarum'd them. He by his Friends acquainted the Em∣perour
of the acts of Hostility, committed by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> against
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants: Adding moreover, that they had made private
propositions to league themselves with the common Enemy; and that
it was one of the Nations of the North, born for the desolation of other
Countries, and to invade the Peace of Empires. That they had setled
themselves in the Islands of the East only by treachery and violence.
That for some years since, they had made it their business to cruise the
Seas between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japon,</HI> on purpose to make themselves absolute
Masters of the Trade, and that if he did not take a speedy course, they
would do the same mischief in his Dominions which the <HI>Tartars</HI> had
done in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="76"/>
The President had much ado to divert the Storm, for the most potent
Lords at Court, although his Pensioners and Friends, began to open
their Eyes, and in some measure took <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s part, saying, That the
<HI>Chineses</HI> were unfortunate enough, in being laid wast by the <HI>Tartars▪</HI>
without being persecuted and afflicted by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> That seeing
that after they had been expell'd their Country, they had nothing left
but their Boats, and some few Rocks for their places of refuge, it was
a piece of inhumanity to disturb them in their last Sanctuaries, and to
deprive them of their liberty of the Sea, and their Commerce with
<HI>Japon,</HI> from whence those miserable Exiles had their chiefest support.
The <HI>Bonzes,</HI> the Merchants, the vulgar People, all took the <HI>Chineses</HI>
part. Thereupon the Emperour sent for the <HI>Dutch</HI> President, and told
him, I understand, said he, that thy Company abuses my Protection,
and that their Vessels, instead of being contented with the Trade which
I have permitted them, presume to play the Pyrates upon the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
and to trouble the Seas adjoyning to my Empire. If I hear any more
of these complaints, I will cause thee and all thy Nation to be Cru∣cifi'd.
I know not how the President appeas'd the Emperour's fury;
this I know in general, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a secret alliance with
the <HI>Tartars</HI> against <HI>Coxinga.</HI> Him the Inhabitants of <HI>Fockien</HI> call'd to
their assistance, having rais'd an Army of 200000 Men; whereupon
he went to aid them with a very powerful Navy. After several Skir∣mishes,
the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> came to a pitch'd Field, where the
Captain of the <HI>Tartars</HI> having plac'd the best part of his Cavalry in
Ambush, order'd his Men to retreat by degrees, 'till they had drawn
the <HI>Chineses</HI> into the Ambuscade; at what time the <HI>Tartars</HI> encom∣passing
them on every side, kill'd 80000 upon the place; <HI>Coxinga</HI> with
his Navy not being able to relieve them.</P>
<P>During this War, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took their opportunity, and made
themselves Masters of the Island of <HI>Fishers,</HI> between <HI>Formosa</HI> and the
Coast of <HI>Fockien.</HI> In a short while after <HI>Coxinga</HI> dy'd, and <HI>Savia</HI> his
Uncle, the richest Merchant of <HI>China,</HI> who out of his own revenue
had disburs'd the expences of the last War, grew weary of the charge,
and was desirous to make Peace with the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Of which one of
the Sons of <HI>Coxinga</HI> being advertiz'd, seiz'd upon his Uncles person,
and shut him up in a close Prison, where he kill'd himself for madness.
The <HI>Hollanders</HI> overjoy'd at the Dath of <HI>Savia,</HI> who had always hin∣der'd
them from the Trade of the Province of <HI>Fockien,</HI> sent a Navy
against his Nephew in favour of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who made War against
him all along the Sea-Coast. Several Combats happen'd between the
<HI>Juncks</HI> of the <HI>Islanders</HI> and the <HI>Holland</HI> Vessels in view of the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
who satisfi'd themselves with being only Spectators. But all the benefit
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> reap'd from the advantages which they obtain'd
over the <HI>Islanders,</HI> was only to put into the Hands of the <HI>Tartars</HI> the
Cities of <HI>Bemos</HI> aed <HI>Quesmoy,</HI> and all the places thereabouts, which
<HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party possess'd before. For notwithstanding all their kindness,
the <HI>Tartars</HI> would not assist them to retake <HI>Tayovan;</HI> so that they only
were content to build certain small Forts in the small Islands adjoyning
to <HI>Formosa:</HI> and since my return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> I never could inform
my self of the truth of the issue of that Enterprize.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not content with their settlement at <HI>Firmando,</HI>
which was an Island both desert and barren, seated upon a Streight,
<PB N="18" REF="77"/>
which separates the Point of the Land of <HI>Corea</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> a place no
way commodious for their Designs of Engrossing the Trade of <HI>China,</HI>
as being too remote from <HI>Nangisaqui:</HI> Besides, that the North and South
Winds are so violent at their Seasons in this Streight, between the two
Coasts, that it is impossible to come near the shoar when they blow.
The President therefore having such good luck in the Expulsion of the
<HI>Portugals</HI> out of <HI>Japon,</HI> doubted not but that he might obtain the small
Island of <HI>Kisma,</HI> an Island that had been wholly deserted ever since the
Habitations of the people had been destroy'd. At first he only desir'd
leave to build a small Tenement for the conveniency of the Factors.
Now between this Island and <HI>Nangisaqui,</HI> there is only a narrow Frith,
not above a Musquet Shot over. Here the President desir'd the Gover∣nour
that he might make a Bridge of Boats for a more easie intercourse
between the City and the Port. The Governour gain'd by Presents,
gave him leave to build the Bridge; but seeing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made an
ill use of it, and that they came too frequently and numerously into the
City, he built two Forts at both ends of the Bridge, and furnish'd
them with Souldiers, who were to take notice who pass'd to and fro.
He also publish'd an Order, That such <HI>Hollanders</HI> as came by day into
the Town, should return to their Lodgings before night, upon pain
of Death. This Order, and the little conveniency which they had for
Lodging in their own Quarters, very much troubl'd them; so that the
President made new Applications at Court, and obtain'd leave to build
a Factory, and Warehouses for their Goods.</P>
<P>The Governour thereupon sent a Surveyor to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to mark
out the Ground which the Emperour had given them to build upon.
This person being largely rewarded, made them good measure, and
yet they were not contented; so that in the Night-time they had
enlarg'd their Quarters, by removing the first marks. The Governour,
being advertiz'd thereof, began to be very angry; but they found means
to appease him with their Presents: so that he easily condescended to the
slight reasons which they gave him for what they had done. Thus in
a short time they finish'd their work, which was without encompass'd
with a Wall, much like a Garden Wall, but within contain'd a real
Fort, flanck'd and lin'd according to all the Rules of Art; and which,
the outward Wall being beaten down, not only defended their Bridge,
but commanded the entry into the Haven of <HI>Nangisaqui.</HI></P>
<P>They took great care not to admit any but <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for fear their
Design should be discover'd. So that when the whole was finish'd, the
President gave advice to the General at <HI>Batavia</HI> what he had done,
desiring him to send him eight Brass Guns, so broken, as to be easily
put together in the places where they were broken. He adviz'd him
also to put them up in Hogsheads, pack'd up like other Goods; and
instead of Mariners, to send a good number of Souldiers, habited like
Mariners, for the security of the Factory. But this Stratagem had not
that success which he expected; for about that time the Emperour had
sent a new Governour to <HI>Nangisaqui:</HI> So that when the Ships arriv'd at
<HI>Batavia,</HI> the new chang'd Officers, being more vigilant then the for∣mer,
coming to weigh the Bales as they were put ashore, and finding
certain Hogsheads at the bottom of the hold, which they could not re∣move
by reason of their weight, they presently brake them up, and
perceiving there the broken pieces of Canons, carry'd some of them
<PB N="19" REF="77"/>
to the Governour, who immediately sent intelligence thereof to <HI>Yeddo,</HI>
of which the President had as suddain notice by his Pensioners. He
having his invention at command, repairs forthwith to the Emperour's
Court, and there tells the Emperour, That he had receiv'd Orders
from his Superiours to present him with certain Peeces of Canon, made
according to the newest Invention of his Country, the use whereof
was so convenient, that they were with little difficulty and trouble to
be drawn up, and made use of, where others could not possibly be brought
to play: and that he thought no Present could be more acceptable or ser∣viceable
to him, to render him Victorious over his Enemies. Upon
this the Emperour was very well satisfi'd, and sent to the Governour
of <HI>Nangisaqui</HI> to send him those Guns, and withall, not to molest the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> either in their Factory, or in vending their Wares.</P>
<P>Having so fortunately disengag'd himself out of these Briers, he lays
another design, and sends to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> a person of a
turbulent and unquiet Spirit like himself, to set out two Vessels, to
make a discovery of all the Coasts of <HI>Japon,</HI> and particularly of those
Coasts which were next the Gold Mines, and to see if they could find
any safe Harbour for Ships to ride in, in those tempestuous Seas, or any
places proper to fortifie, that they might no longer depend upon the
uncertain humour of the Court of <HI>Japon,</HI> which was as inconstant as
their Seas. The General provided two Ships, and furnish'd them with
excellent Pilots, good Souldiers, expert Mariners, and Provisions for
two years, with all other Necessaries and Instruments, as well for del∣ving
as building. One of the seven of the General's Council was chos'n
Supervisor of the Enterprize. 'Tis said, that those two Vessels skirted
all along the Coast of <HI>Japon,</HI> from the East to the South, and from the
South to the North, fetching a compass about the Islands to the 47 <HI>deg.</HI>
of Northern Latitude, and that they discover'd one Island which they
call'd <HI>The States Island,</HI> and afterwards touch'd upon another Land
which they nam'd <HI>The Company's Land,</HI> inhabited by White people,
with long Hair, habited after the <HI>Japon</HI> fashion, which they found to
be a Continent adjoyning to <HI>Niulhan,</HI> and <HI>Corea;</HI> and that after they
had wander'd a long time upon the Sea, without any other design
then to make new Discoveries, they pass'd through the Streights of
<HI>Sanguar,</HI> which separates the Land of <HI>Yesso</HI> from <HI>Japon,</HI> and kept along
those Coasts of <HI>Japon</HI> to the East, to observe the Bays of <HI>Aizu,</HI> and
<HI>Xendai,</HI> where are the Gold Mines. In that part a furious Tempest
took them, in sight of the Mountains, where the Gold Mines lye,
which lasted four days together. The second of these Vessels run full
against a Rock, and split her self, with the total loss of every Mothers
Son in the Vessel. The Admiral held out a longer time, but coasting
the Land where the Mountains of <HI>Sataque</HI> appear, the Tempest grew
so violent, that she also brake against the Rocks. In this second Ship∣wrack
only the Admiral, and thirteen persons more escap'd, partly by
the help of the Planks, and partly by Swiming. The <HI>Japonners</HI> upon
the Coast presently ran to view them, and wonder'd to see people in
those parts, whose Language they did not understand. Nevertheless,
they entertain'd them civilly enough; but in regard they were Stran∣gers,
and that there was a strict prohibition not to receive any Stran∣gers
among them upon any pretence whatsoever, they were at a great
loss what to do with 'em. One, wiser then the rest, advis'd his
<PB N="20" REF="78"/>
Brethren to carry them to the Emperour, whose counsel was follow'd;
and so they took their journey toward <HI>Yeddo,</HI> which was above a hun∣dred
Leagues off.</P>
<P>The Emperour, being inform'd of their arrival, order'd that they
should be civilly us'd; and at the end of eight days sent for them, and
caus'd them to be ask'd, of what Country they were, and what Design
brought them into his Seas? The Admiral, who was a person of a
ready ingenuity, answer'd, That he was a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who all his life
time had serv'd his Country as a Souldier, where he had the command
of a thousand Horse, and two thousand Foot, at what time Fortune,
or rather the care of preserving his Honour, forc'd him from his Native
Soyl. I was, said he, one of the chief Commanders in the Army,
and though I say it, my Service had gain'd me a fair reputation.
The Prince, who commanded us, had a great confidence in me, which
made one of his near Relations jealous of me; so that he was not only
content to do me all ill Offices with the General, but sought all occa∣sions
to pick a quarrel with me. I dare be bold to say, that had he not
been so nearly related to the Prince, I should not have taken his affronts
so long patiently. But at length he provok'd that patience to such a
degree, and so deeply and openly affronted me, that I was constrain'd
to meet him with my Sword in my hand. His misfortune and mine so
order'd it, that I kill'd him at the first push. My Friends assisted me to
make my escape, and kept me hid for some days, thinking to have ap∣peas'd
the Princes anger; but it continu'd so violent, that they advis'd
me to absent my self for some years. Therefore to render my Exile less
tedious, and that I might be still doing something for the Service of my
Country, I desir'd my Friends to furnish me with two Ships, with a
resolution to seek out and destroy all those Pirates that infested the <HI>Indian</HI>
Seas. I have been in chace of them for a whole year together; and
sometimes we met with Tempests so violent, that drave us we know not
whither our selves, my Pilots not being experienc'd in the Eastern Seas.
Soon after meeting with another Tempest no less rude and boystrous,
we were forc'd to let our Ships drive as the Winds themselves were
pleas'd to force them, which at length drove us upon the Coasts of this
Empire, where we have suffer'd Shipwrack, not having sav'd above
fourteen of four hundred, which I brought along with me. Happy
in such a misfortune, to be cast upon the Territories of a Prince so
potent and generous, that, no question, will have compassion upon our
miseries.</P>
<P>When the Interpreter had repeated this Relation to the Emperour, the
Prince, and all the Lords of the Court were very much concern'd, and
admir'd both the Courage and Aspect of the Stranger. The Emperour sent
him very rich Presents, and to all those of his Company; and gave
Order, that he should be conducted to <HI>Kisma,</HI> to the <HI>Holland</HI> Factory,
and that he should be well treated upon the way, during the whole
journey, which was five and twenty or thirty days Travel. There
this famous Champion stay'd four Months, in expectation of the Ships
that come every year from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Japon;</HI> so that he had time enough
to make a full Relation of the Lands which he had observ'd, and of all
the particulars of the Shipwrack. One day as he was telling how he had
cajoll'd the Emperour, and that the President was applauding the quick∣ness
of his wit for inventing such an imaginary piece of Knight-Errantry,
<PB N="21" REF="78"/>
a <HI>Japonese</HI> Boy that serv'd the President, heard all the dis∣course,
without being observ'd by his Master. Some Months after,
the President had beaten this Boy, which he, as all the <HI>Japoneses</HI> are
of a fiery and vindicative Nature, resolving to revenge, went to the
Governour of <HI>Nangisaqui,</HI> and repeated to him the whole Discourse
between his Master and the Admiral. The Governour, finding it to
be a business of importance, sends advice thereof to the Court. The
Emperour was so enrag'd at the injury and affront put upon him, that
he commanded the Governour to stop the Admiral and his Train, and to
send him with a good Guard to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> and not to let any Ship enter the
Harbour, 'till he had had a full Examination of the matter.</P>
<P>This Order was not so secret, but that the Presidents Friends had
notice thereof, who presently gave him intelligence of it so seasonably,
that the Admiral was sent away before the Order came to the Governour.
Eight days after, three <HI>Holland</HI> Vessels arriv'd at <HI>Kisma,</HI> to whom the
Governour sent express command to keep out at Sea, and not to come
ashore. The President feigning to be surpriz'd at this Prohibition, went
to the Governour to know the reason, who gave him this Answer, The
Emperour, said he, is acquainted with your tricks, you shall have no
more kindness from me; I have sent to Court to give notice of the
arrival of your three Ships, and I shall follow my Orders when they
come. Upon this the President made no doubt but the Admiral's story
was discover'd; and recollecting with himself that he had beaten his
<HI>Japonese</HI> Boy, and that he was run away from him, he soon conjectur'd
at the Author of all the mischief. In short, the Governour receives his
Orders, the Tenour whereof was, That he should send away the three
Vessels, without permitting them to land either Men or Goods; and
that he should tell the President, That the Emperour was satisfi'd that
the Admiral was a Cheat and a Spy, whom he intended to punish
severely; and therefore, if he did not send for him to <HI>Japon</HI> by the first
opportunity of the Winds, he would put to Death all those of his
Nation, and fling their Goods into the Sea.</P>
<P>Upon the return of three Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> there was no small hurly
burly in the Island; for by them they understood the danger that their
Country-men were in, if they did not send back the Admiral. There∣upon
an extraordinary Council was call'd, to deliberate upon an affair
of so great importance, who were all of one mind, that the Admi∣ral
was to be sent back, and that it was better for one to suffer, then a
whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Admiral being advertiz'd of this their resolution, publickly pro∣tested
against the violence and injustice they were about to do him;
telling them, that he was born a Subject of the Republick of <HI>Holland,</HI>
who had only the Power of his life and death; that in their Service, he
would expose his life to a thousand hazards, but that he was not oblig'd
to sacrifice himself for the particular Interests of a private Trade.
The Ministers took his part, and made it a case in Religion. The
common people mutiny'd against the General, and the Tumult
grew to that heat, that the Sea-men were sent for from aboard their
Ships to disperse the multitude. At length, by the interposition of
a Minister, the business was brought to a conclusion; who perswaded
the Admiral by his smooth Language, to appease the disorder of the
people, by submitting to the Result of the Council. Thereupon he
<PB N="22" REF="79"/>
promis'd to return to <HI>Japon,</HI> provided they would allow him what he
demanded, not only for his reward, but also that which should bear
him out in that same new part which he had in his head to act.</P>
<P>First he demanded two Ships magnificently trim'd, a Train of fifty
chosen Men, every one of which was to have three changes of Habit,
of the richest Stuffs that could be had: Moreover 50000 Crowns for
his Voyage, a Cupboard of Gold and Silver Plate, with all Equipage
proportionable, and that those that accompany'd him should respect
him, as a person of great Quality.</P>
<P>All this was allow'd him, and the Admiral departed from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and
arriv'd well at <HI>Nangisaqui.</HI> The Governour surpriz'd at the beauty of
the Vessels, could not believe them to be Merchants, and therefore sent
to know who they were; but he was more surpriz'd when he knew
that it was the Admiral. Forthwith he dispatch'd a Courrier to the Em∣perour,
to give him notice, and to inform him with what magnificence
the Admiral was return'd. The President also sent, that he might have
a favourable reception, and to desire his Friends to let the Emperour
know, that this was a Person of great Quality, whom an Honourable
Action had driven from his Country, and that he no sooner understood
the accusation that lay against him, but that he was return'd with that
Equipage that became him, to justifie himself.</P>
<P>'Till the Order came, the Governour, according to custom, caus'd
all the Sails and Rudders of the Ships to be brought to him, not per∣mitting
any person to come ashore. At length the Order came, that
the Admiral and his Attendants should be receiv'd into the City, toge∣ther
with all things necessary for their persons, and that they should be
convoy'd to <HI>Yeddo,</HI> and that in all places where they came, they should
be nobly treated. The President accompany'd the Admiral to assist
him, as well with his Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ils, as with the favour of his Friends.
Their Entry was very magnificent, and the richness of their Habits
brought the people from all parts, as being mainly greedy after No∣velty,
so that the noise thereof was spread all over the Court: Yet the
Emperour would not admit them to their Audience upon the day which
they desir'd.</P>
<P>Two Months were elaps'd, during which time the Admiral kept
open Table, and display'd his dasling Riches to the Eyes of the <HI>Japoneses,</HI>
and being of a quick and apprehensive wit, he caus'd himself to be in∣structed
in the Language of the Island, and in a short time he began to un∣derstand
many Words. When the Emperour sent for him, he clad himself
and his Train in a richer Habit then that which they had on when he
made his Entry. At first the Emperour seem'd to be angry; I understand,
said he, that thou art an Impostor and a Traytor, that thy Birth is
obscure, and that thou art come as a spy into my Kingdom, and therefore
I am resolv'd to punish thee according to thy merits.</P>
<P>When the Interpreter had explain'd the Emperour's words, the
Admiral with an undaunted countenance, Sir, said he, a Prince so
great as you are, should rather be a comfort and support to the unfortu∣nate,
then add to their affliction. Fortune, that persecutes me, has
in nothing been more cruel to me, then in raising those Calumnies,
with which she has endeavour'd to blemish my reputation with your Ma∣jesty.
She might expell me my Country, and cast me upon unknown
Coasts at the other end of the World; but she can never inspire into
<PB N="23" REF="79"/>
me thoughts unworthy of my Birth. This is the second time I have been
within your Dominions, the first by occasion of Shipwrack, the second
to obey your Majesties commands. The first accuses none but the
Winds. And had I been guilty of what I am accus'd, I should never have
ventur'd my self into your hands so far off from your Power. But,
Sir, my Accusers have one advantage which I have not; they speak
your Language, I understand it not, nor how to make you apprehend
the truth of my justification. Allow me eight Months to learn the
Speech of your Country, and then, if you will be so gratious as to hear
me, I make no doubt but to confound my Accusers, and to satisfie your
Majesty in all things.</P>
<P>The Emperour was surpriz'd, and mov'd with his Answer, but more
especially at his request of eight Months to learn the <HI>Japonick</HI> Language.
I grant it thee, said the Emperour, for it is but just that a person ac∣cus'd
should have both the Liberty and means to do it. And in the mean
time I will take care that thou be honourably entertain'd in all places
where thou hast a desire to reside.</P>
<P>The Admiral us'd this Liberty with so much prudence, and got so
much the love of the Courtiers by his carriage and his liberality, that
by their converse, he not only learnt the Language, but by vertue
of their good Character, the Emperour would often send for him, and
ask him several Questions concerning our <HI>Europe,</HI> in reference to the
Qualities of the Countries, the Manners of the People, the several
Forms of Government, the Extent of the several Kingdoms, their
Riches, Strength, and War-like Discipline; of all which, the Admi∣ral
gave him so handsome an Accompt, that the Prince took great de∣light
in his Discourse. And at length he had gain'd so much the favour
and confidence of the Emperour, that he utterly laid aside all the ill
thoughts which he had of him, and condemn'd to Death, as a false
Witness, and a Traducer, the <HI>Japonese</HI> that had accus'd him.</P>
<P>After so fortunate an escape, the Admiral thought it but common
prudence to make a fair retreat in the Grandeur of his Reputation, and
thereupon he took leave of the Emperour, who loaded him with Honours
and Presents. The Courtiers were also sorry for his departure, so that
some of them accompany'd him back, and took order for his entertain∣ment,
which was very magnificent all the way to <HI>Nangisaqui,</HI> where
he took Shipping a few days after, and return'd to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>All the People throng'd to the Port to see him when he Landed. He
told them in few words the success of his Voyage. Some applauded
his ingenuity and courage; others extoll'd the Service which he had
done the Company and Nation. The Council receiv'd him also with
thanks and praises, and gave him all the Gold and Plate which he had
brought back. A while after he departed for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where he
was no sooner arriv'd, but he presented a Petition to the States General
against the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, for sending him back to <HI>Japon,</HI> and for
reparation of the violence and injury done him. The business was
long in debate, but at last the Company was condemn'd to pay him
great damages, and Interest for the same.</P>
<P>But to return to the President: He began now to be weary of being
confin'd to one Factory, though he made up his Pack well enough
where he was. But his Ambition carry'd him farther, and he thought
he had done Service enough to be advanc'd to a higher Dignity. Nei∣ther
<PB N="24" REF="80"/>
was his presence so necessary at <HI>Japon,</HI> where he had settl'd the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Trade in as good a condition as it could well be. And in truth,
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had then almost the whole Trade of the <HI>East-Indies.</HI>
They had taken from the <HI>English, Formosa, Amboyna,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooleron,</HI> and
by that means engross'd all the Trade of Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs.
They had taken <HI>Baton</HI> by surprize. The Inhabitants of the <HI>Celebes,
Ternate,</HI> and <HI>Tidor,</HI> were become their Vassals; and the King of <HI>Ma∣cassar</HI>
having made an Alliance with them, had expell'd the <HI>Portugueses</HI>
out of his Dominions. By means of their Factories in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> they
had got all the Pepper Trade of the Western Coast of that Island into
their hands, besides several other advantages which they had in several
other places, where they had encroach'd upon the <HI>Portugals, Spaniards,</HI>
and the <HI>English</HI> themselves. The <HI>East-India</HI> Company at that time enter∣tain'd
140 Ships, part Men of War, and part Merchant-men, pro∣vided
with great Guns, Ammunition, and Provision of all sorts, and
in these Ships above 6000 Men, part Souldiers, part Mariners. <HI>Bata∣via</HI>
was the Soul of their Conquests, made upon the Ruins of the <HI>Portu∣gueses,</HI>
which had they lain all together, would have made a large
Empire, and by which they might have grown infinitely rich, had
not the expences of their Navies and Souldiers eaten out the gains of
their vast Trade. One of their wisest Generals told me frequently,
<HI>We have,</HI> said he, <HI>but too many Fortresses, we need no more then the</HI> Cape
of Good Hope, <HI>and</HI> Batavia, <HI>Factories well settl'd, good Ships, and honest
Men to serve us.</HI> For in short, their Officers pillage unmercifully, and
cause the Commerce and Dominion of their Country men to be detested
by the <HI>Indians,</HI> through their <HI>Covetousness</HI> and <HI>Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>I know my self, that in the year 1664, the Expences of the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> amounted, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> to twelve Millions a year,
not to reckon Shipwracks, decay of Ships, and wast of Goods, and
yet their Cargo's for <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> have not amounted to above ten
Millions; and sometimes the Cargo's are so mean, that the Receits do
not answer the Expences. Nevertheless their perseverance and courage
were worthy of admiration. For what could be more to be admir'd,
then to see that a small number of Merchants, assembled at first upon
the single score of Trade, should afterwards presume to make War in
Regions so far distant, assail so many Princes and Nations, plant so
many Colonies, besiege so many Cities and Forts, and lastly, set forth
so many Navies at such prodigious Expences, that it would put many
potent Soveraigns to a plunge to do as they did?</P>
<P>This was the Estate of the <HI>Holland East-India</HI> Company, at what time
the President, the principal Subject of this Relation, was recall'd from
<HI>Japon</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> there to take upon him the Office of <HI>Chief Director.</HI>
He carry'd thither great store of Wealth, and built several magnificent
Houses in the City. His Authority also was very large; but he exer∣cis'd
it according to his usual custom, and was hated by all the Officers
of the Company, and the Citizens themselves. He thought himself
secure of the Employment of General, but he was deceiv'd in his hopes;
upon which he took pet, and return'd for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where he liv'd
quietly for some years. At length his turbulent and ambitious Spirit put
him upon new Designs, to revenge the injury which he thought he had
receiv'd. To which purpose he return'd to the <HI>Indies.</HI> His undertaking
was not so prosperous for those that employ'd him, and who merited to
<PB N="25" REF="80"/>
have been better serv'd. He pillag'd, couzen'd, and caus'd several
disorders in their affairs, and at length returning home again, perish'd
in the River of <HI>Lisbon</HI> with his Money and Jewels, as hath been already
related.</P>

Sieur <HI>de la Boulaye,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Anjou,</HI> with the Sieurs <HI>Beber,
Mariage,</HI> and <HI>du Pont,</HI> Deputies of the new <HI>French</HI> Company, for the
settling of Trade in <HI>Persia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and took
up their Lodgings at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> being the Suburbs of the same City, where
also at that time liv'd the Sieur <HI>L'Estoile,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Merchant. <HI>Lalin</HI> and
<HI>Boulaye,</HI> without saying any thing to the Deputies, deliver'd to <HI>L'Estoile</HI>
the Letters which Monsieur <HI>de Lyonne</HI> had written to him; the Inscrip∣tion
whereof was thus. <HI>To Mr.</HI> L'Estoile, <HI>first</HI> Valet du Chambre <HI>to the
King of</HI> Persia, <HI>or in his absence, to Mr.</HI> Logis, <HI>his Son in Law.</HI> Which
was not a little to be admir'd at by the <HI>Franks,</HI> who had sojourn'd any
time in that Country, to find that Monsier <HI>Boulaye,</HI> who had been be∣fore
in <HI>Persia,</HI> and should have better understood the Custom of the
Court, should be no better able to instruct a Secretary of State, then to
let him give <HI>L'Estoile</HI> the Title of <HI>Valet du Chambre</HI> to the King of <HI>Persia,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="81"/>
who has none to serve him in his Chamber but Eunuchs, and never
suffers a <HI>Christian</HI> to touch his Habits, for fear of being defil'd.</P>
<P>The purport of the Letters, was to admonish <HI>L'Estoile</HI> to support;
assist, and protect the Deputies in the Business upon which the Com∣pany
had sent them; and in case of losses by the way, to furnish them
with such necessaries as they should want.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Persia</HI> was then three days journey from <HI>Ispahan;</HI> for
which reason a Messenger was dispatch'd with a Letter to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> or
Grand Master of the House, and another to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> or his
Lieutenant, to know whether his Majesty would command them to
wait on him there, or whether they should expect his return to <HI>Ispahan.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the Deputies could not agree amongst themselves:
For the three Merchants <HI>Beber, Mariage,</HI> and <HI>du Pont</HI> affirm'd, that
the two Gentlemen were only interested by the by in this Negotiation;
and that having no right to take cognizance of the Affairs of the Com∣pany,
they ought not to trouble themselves any farther, then the King's
Letters directed them, in the affairs of the Company. That the Effect
of the King's Letters was no more, then that two Gentlemen, desirous
to see the Court of <HI>Persia,</HI> were joyn'd with the Deputies of the Com∣pany;
and therefore it belong'd to them only to treat with the Ministers
of the King of <HI>Persia.</HI> That the Gentlemen had no more to do then to
deliver the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Persian</HI> King, and to desire a
nomination of Commissioners to treat with the Deputies. This con∣test,
which all the <HI>Franks</HI> in vain endeavour'd to compose, came at
length to the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Ears; who was strangely surpriz'd at it, having
then a design to procure an Order from the King to remove out of
<HI>Ispahan</HI> and the Suburbs, all the <HI>Christians</HI> of what opinion soever, and
place them over against <HI>Zulpha.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Deputies rais'd new objections and difficulties every
day; which Father <HI>Raphael</HI> of <HI>Mans,</HI> Superiour of the Order of <HI>Capu∣chins</HI>
in <HI>Persia,</HI> employ'd all his credit and industry to accommodate.
He wrote them out several forms of a Letter, which they were to send
to the <HI>Nazar;</HI> but those that pleas'd the one Party, did not like the other.
At length Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> weary of scribling and altering, amending and
correcting, and all to no purpose; told them seriously, they did ill to
act in such a manner, and to insist upon idle formalities; that the <HI>Persian</HI>
Style, wherein they ought to write to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> ought to be concise
and plain, without superfluities, or impertinencies; and lastly, that
all their contentions did but redound to the disadvantage of the Com∣pany,
whose Interests they pretended to manage. After several con∣tests,
Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> at last, finish'd the Letter to the content of both
Parties, which was transcrib'd into the <HI>Persian</HI> Language; with ano∣ther
to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> and both were dispatch'd away. The <HI>Nazar</HI>
having read it, presently inform'd the King of the <HI>French</HI> Companies
design, and of the arrival of the Deputies. His Majesty commanded
him to let them know that they were welcome, and that in a short
time, he would return to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and give them Audience.</P>
<P>Some few dayes after, the Court return'd to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and while the
King stopp'd at one of his Houses near the Gates of the City, the <HI>Nazar</HI>
sent for Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to know of him who the <HI>French</HI> Deputies were,
and who had sent them into <HI>Persia,</HI> to which the Father gave him the
best satisfaction he could. For the <HI>Nazar</HI> wonder'd that they were
<PB N="28" REF="82"/>
come into the Kingdom, and sent, as they said, from such a potent
Prince, and yet that the Governours of <HI>Erivan</HI> and <HI>Tauris</HI> should know
nothing of their passage through those Cities. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> also
was in the same Astonishment; and it gave them reason to suspect both
the Quality of their Persons, and the Reality of their Commission.
For either they were ignorant of the custom of the Country, or else
they did ill to travel <HI>incognito,</HI> like ordinary Tradesmen, and Persons of
mean condition. But Father <HI>Raphael</HI> having assur'd them, that they
were sent by the King of <HI>France</HI> to settle a Company of Trade, and
that he had Letters of Advice thereof out of <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Nazar</HI> bid
Father <HI>Raphael</HI> tell the Deputies they should be in a readiness, for that
the King would give them Audience in a few days.</P>
<P>But the former misunderstanding, still continuing between the Gen∣tlemen
and Deputies, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> fearing some mischievous conse∣quence
of it in the presence of the King, or that they should make some
dispute for priority, the Father represented to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> that whereas
the Deptuies were of two Orders, the one of Gentlemen, and the
other of Merchants; therefore to take away all suspition of jealousie,
it would do well, that His Majesty would be pleas'd when he admitted
them to their Audience, to permit the Gentlemen their seats on the one
side, and the Merchants on the other. Which the <HI>Nazar</HI> approv'd, and
the King allow'd of the same day.</P>
<P>The 27<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September,</HI> the King being at his Palace of <HI>Scader-Abbas,</HI>
upon the bank of the River, between the Bridge of <HI>Zulpha,</HI>
and the Bridge of <HI>Schiras,</HI> caus'd a preparation of Artificial Fire-works
to be made, which came to above 2000 <HI>l.</HI> and early in the Morning
caus'd notice to be given, that he intended that day to give audience to
the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Deputies. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> also had Order to be
ready with the Deputies, to the end, the <HI>Mehemender,</HI> or Master of
the Ceremonies, might not be oblig'd to wait. Accordingly that very
day the <HI>Mehemender</HI> came to <HI>L'Estoile</HI>'s House, and from thence con∣ducted
the Deputies, with all their Train, and the rest of the Franks
then resident in those parts all mounted on Horse-back, with a march so
slow and grave, and for the advantage of the sight so far about, that it
was almost Night before they arriv'd at <HI>Scader-Abbas;</HI> at what time the
<HI>Mehemender</HI> enter'd the Palace alone, leaving the Merchants at the
Door. In the mean while, the Merchants believing that Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
did not favour them so much as the Gentlemen, cry'd out aloud, that
they would have an Interpreter also for themselves, or else would go no
farther. Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> who acted only by the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Order, and
for the advantage of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, told them, that whither they
went any farther or no it was all one to him: that for his part he was
not there as an Interpreter, either for the one or the other, but only in
obedience to the King's commands.</P>
<P>In the mid'st of this debate the <HI>Mehemender</HI> return'd to carry the De∣puties
to their Audience; five hundred Musketeers being rank'd in order
upon the bank of the River, to give them a Volley as they pass'd along.
The <HI>Mehemender</HI>'s march at first was slow and grave, but approaching the
place where the King was, and from whence he had a view of the De∣puties,
he caus'd them to double their pace to the foot of the Steps,
where the Lackeys took off their Shooes; and from thence they proceeded
into the Hall of Audience, where the <HI>Kans,</HI> and other great Lords were
<PB N="29" REF="82"/>
sitting. Upon each side stood the Youth of Quality, sumptuously clad
in Tissue of Gold and Silver, their Cloaks and Mantles being lin'd
with Martins, Sables, and other rich Furs. The Deputies being come
into the King's presence, the <HI>Mehemender</HI> caus'd them to kneel, and
bow their Heads to the Ground three times: That done, he
caus'd them to rise, and lead up <HI>Lalin</HI> by the hand alone, as being the
person who had in charge the presenting of the Letter to the King.
After him follow'd <HI>Boulaye,</HI> and the rest of the Deputies, and thus they
mounted up to the place where sate the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> and the <HI>Nazar.</HI> The
King was seated upon a Scaffold somewhat higher then the rest, encom∣pas'd
with 150 young Gentlemen magnificently clad, to whom the
<HI>Sieur Lalin,</HI> at the head of the Deputies, made his compliments in
<HI>French,</HI> and then humbly presented the Kings Letter, seal'd with a flat
Seal upon a flying <HI>Label,</HI> enclos'd in an Embroider'd Box, with the
Arms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navar,</HI> in relief, upon the Lid. Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
explain'd to the King the effect of <HI>Lalin</HI>'s Speech. After which the
King gave a little bow with his Head, and at the same time gave a sign
to the Master of the Ceremonies to carry them back to their places.
Being come to the bottom of the Hall, where the Officers had Order to
separate the Gentlemen from the Merchants, the Officers by mistake put
<HI>Boulaye</HI> with two of the Merchants, and <HI>Mariage</HI> one of the Mer∣chants
with <HI>Lalin,</HI> which made <HI>Boulaye</HI> cry out aloud in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Lan∣guage
<HI>Menbeg-Zaddè,</HI> I am a Gentlemen; but the thing being done, and
the King being present, there was no help. Then the <HI>Persian</HI> Musick
began to play for a quarter of an Hour; which having given over,
the Master of the Ceremonies came again, and carried up Father <HI>Ra∣phael,</HI>
and the two Gentlemen, as he suppos'd, of which <HI>Mariage</HI> by
the forementioned mistake happen'd to be one, again to the King: at
what time <HI>Lalin</HI> with a comely grace made his Harangue, and set forth
the occasion of his Deputation to His Majesty, of which His Majesty
testifi'd his good liking by a nod of his Head. For <HI>Lalin</HI> had a handsom
presence, and spake with an acceptable Tone, and his magnificent
Habit very much added to the comely Air of his Person. The Speech
was expounded by Father <HI>Raphael;</HI> which when he had done, the King
ask'd the Deputies several Questions, and then with his hand made them
a sign to retire to their places, beck'ning at the same time to Father <HI>Ra∣phael</HI>
to stay; and causing him to come near him, more particularly in∣form'd
himself of the Power of the King of <HI>France,</HI> the Extent of his
Dominions, his Military Discipline, and his Councils: of all which
the Father gave him the best accompt he could, and then with the King's
leave, retir'd to his place. This Scene being over, a Flagon of Gold,
and a Glass were sent to the Deputies, attended with a short Banquet of
Fruits, and other sorts of Food; the Instrumental and Vocal Musick
playing all the while. Which being over, the King again sent for
<HI>Lalin, Mariage,</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and after a short Discourse, having
dismiss'd all but father <HI>Raphael,</HI> he fell into a dispute with him touching
the Unity of the Divine Nature, the necessity of one Prophet, and
how <HI>Mahomet</HI> was the Seal and Crown of all Prophets. He seem'd to
admire that the <HI>Franks,</HI> who had the Reputation of being People of Wit
and Discretion, could think <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be a God: to all which parti∣culars,
the Father endeavour'd to give the King the best satisfaction he
could. But then, Father <HI>Raphael</HI> being desirous that the three Deputies
<PB N="30" REF="83"/>
should partake of the King's favour as the other two had done. Where∣upon
the King sent for the other three Deputies, and having discours'd
a while with <HI>Boulaye,</HI> while Father <HI>Raphael</HI> interpreted between them,
in a short while he dismiss'd them all again, but Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> with
whom he enter'd into a more jocular Discourse then the former, of the
Colours, Black and White, and of the Beauty of the <HI>French</HI> Women,
the King confessing that naturally he did not love Brown Women, the
White complection being more agreeable to him, as being that com∣plexion
which alone compos'd the Beauty of Women. The Father
modestly made his answer, that Beauty consisted only in fancy; for
that the <HI>Persians</HI> lov'd thick and full Eyebrows, which were not at all
esteem'd in <HI>France.</HI> Then the King casting his Eyes upon the Box
wherein the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter lay, he took out the Letter, and
observing it to be a small piece of Parchment, and not such a one as he
had receiv'd from several Princes and Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> nor indeed
like those which the <HI>Jesuits</HI> had brought him formerly from the King
of <HI>France</HI> himself, in a fair piece of Parchment, with a large Seal deep
cut, he gave evident Demonstrations of his contempt of it, and was
about to have thrown it away. Father <HI>Raphael</HI> perceiv'd him to be out
of humour, to whom the King in pursuance of his dislike, said, <HI>Ra∣phael,</HI>
I never receive open Letters without a Seal, take it, and let me
see it no more, for I do not believe it comes from so great a King as the
King of <HI>France,</HI> and at the same time made him a sign to retire. He
durst do no otherwise then take the Letter, and so returning to his place,
he told both <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage</HI> what had pass'd in his Discourse be∣tween
him and the King. Two hours, after that, were spent in be∣holding
the <HI>Mummeries</HI> of their common Dancers, a pastime very
usual in <HI>Persia.</HI> Which being over, the King sent again for <HI>Lalin,
Mariage,</HI> and the Father; and after some few Questions, to whith they
gave the best Answers they could, he again dismiss'd both the Deputies,
retaining only Father <HI>Raphael</HI> with him. The Father, then taking his
opportunity, told the King, that he had always observ'd it to be the
custom of the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> to cause the Letters, which the <HI>European</HI>
Princes sent His Majesty, to be interpreted in his presence. And
therefore, added the Father, I beseech Your Majesty to permit me to
give the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI> to the end, it may
be truly interpreted to him according to usual custom. Thereupon the
King made a sign to the Father to give it him, and glad he was to be so
rid of it. The Father observing the King in a good humour, spoke to
him in behalf of the other three Deputies, that he would be pleas'd to
admit them to be sent for a second time, in regard the others had been
sent for three times. But the King told him, it was enough for him to
speak to the Gentlemen, let his Ministers talk with the Merchants.
The Father being then dismiss'd, he sent for <HI>Lalin</HI> alone, for whom he
shew'd himself to have a very great kindness and affection; and at the
same time commanded the <HI>Nazar</HI> to bring him the next day, together
with Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Lagis</HI> the <HI>Genevese,</HI> who was retain'd in his
Service, to Court, for that he intended to be merry with them. Then
he went on, and told <HI>Lalin,</HI> that so soon as the <HI>French</HI> Ships were arriv'd, he
would send an Embassadour to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and make a strict
Alliance with him. <HI>Lalin</HI> reply'd, that His Majesty of <HI>France</HI> desir'd
nothing more. Why then, reply'd the King, is not my Alliance suffi∣cient,
<PB N="31" REF="83"/>
but that you must go seek the Alliance of the Blacks, from
whom you will not draw those advantages, with which you flatter
your selves? For you must know, that the Deputies kept their affairs
so secret, that no body knew of them but all the World, the Servants
as well as the Masters. Not considering, that the <HI>Persians</HI> are good Poli∣ticians,
and that that Court is never without Spies. Therefore the
King knew, that as soon as the Deputies had dispatch'd at his Court,
they were to depart for the <HI>Indies,</HI> with which Nation he keeps no good
Correspondence. And for that reason, he was not a little offended with
them, though they endeavour'd to persuade him, that their Errand to
the <HI>Indies</HI> was only for Linnen and Spices.</P>
<P>The Deputies presented to the King a very fair <HI>Fuzee,</HI> together with
the Kings Picture, in little, drawn to the Life, which was so much the
more esteem'd, because at the same time several large Cuts had been
brought to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and presented to the King, which perfectly agreed
with the Picture in Oyl, by which the whole Court was convinc'd that
it was the real Portraiture of the King. When these Presents were laid
before the King, he ask'd the Deputies, for which of the Eastern Na∣tions
the <HI>French</HI> had most affection; to whom M. <HI>Lalin</HI> made answer,
that certainly for the <HI>Persian;</HI> thereupon the King return'd, that cer∣tainly
they had reason; for that the <HI>Persians</HI> were white, like the <HI>French,</HI>
and that it was impossible for them to have any affection for the <HI>Indians</HI>
who were black.</P>
<P>At length the King, to shew the Deputies his highest favour, would
have them drink the <HI>HEZARD PICHE,</HI> in a golden Cup, which holds
about a Pint of <HI>Paris.</HI> He order'd the Wine to be the same which he
drank himself, which was in a Bottle of Chrystal Glass, studded with
Diamonds. <HI>Lalin</HI> drank couragiously, and so did <HI>Mariage;</HI> but Father
<HI>Raphael</HI> made a fair excuse, and got off. After midnight the <HI>Zerhaftes,</HI>
or Table-Cloaths of Cloth of Gold were spread upon the Floor, and
several roasted Viands very hot of the Spice, and Dishes of Salt Fish,
purchas'd from the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, were brought and set upon the Cloaths;
together with several Pastrie Meats, dry'd Raisins, Comfits, Almonds,
and Pistaches, and other provocatives to drink. The repast being
ended, several Buffons were brought in, who Sung and Danc'd after
the <HI>Turkish</HI> fashion, and made a hundred wry Mouths and ugly Faces.
Among the rest of the Divertisements, there were two Men introduc'd,
that play'd one against another with each a Battoon in his hand, with a
piece of Linnen dipt in Naphta, ty'd to the end of the Stick, which cast
forth a very clear brightness in the dark; at the same time four artificial
Whirle-Winds were made to rise one after another, which were all
hovering in the Air at once, and in a continual Agitation.</P>
<P>Three Hours after Midnight the Masters of the Ceremonies came to
raise the Deputies to take leave of the King; and so leading them to
the lower end of the Hall, after a profound reverence, they retir'd, not
one person beside stirring out of his place, to the end they might have
time to take their Shoes without confusion. When they were gone, the
King dismiss'd the Court, and then it is that the croud is so great, that
not one in twenty but loses their own, and gets whose-ever Shoes he
can lay his hands on.</P>
<P>The Deputies and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> being upon their return home, by
that time they got half way, met an Officer belonging to the <HI>Athemadoulet,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="84"/>
who told Father <HI>Raphael</HI> that his Master expected the <HI>French Begzades</HI>
at his House by Ten a Clock next Morning, to treat them, by his Majesties
Order.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Raphael, Lalin,</HI> and <HI>Boulaye,</HI> were punctual to their time, and
no sooner did the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> know of their arrival, but he came
down into his Hall of Audience, to receive them, where he had also
order'd a very fair Banquet to be ready for their entertainment. There
Father <HI>Raphael</HI> left them, while he went with the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI>'s Secre∣tary,
to Translate the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter into the <HI>Persian</HI> Lan∣guage;
which being finish'd, and he come again into the Hall, after
several Civilities past on both sides, the Father and the Deputies return'd
to <HI>Zulpha.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant Deputies offended at the Honour which the Gentle∣men
had receiv'd, would have gone in their Turn; but Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
told them, that it was not the Custom in <HI>Persia</HI> to visit the Prime Mi∣nister,
without being sent for. In the Evening, Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> and
the <HI>Begzades</HI> received new Orders to attend the King, but the King
stirr'd not out that Evening, so that their Journey was in vain.</P>
<P>The Merchants still perceiving the Honours which were done the
Gentlemen, and believing Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to be the cause of all, they
began to rail at him, and give him foul Language, and threaten'd to
write into <HI>France</HI> to give an accompt of his behaviour. Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
netled at the Language of the Deputies, told them, that he had done
what in him lay to procure them the same Honours, which the others
had receiv'd, though they were so little sensible of it. That he would
continue his endeavours for the Advancement of their Affairs, though
not for their own sakes, yet for the sake of the Company, that had sent
them. Which answer, though it were sharp enough, and shew'd that
the Father was angry, yet he did not forget, that they were his Coun∣trymen;
so that he ventur'd to carry them twice to the Prime Minister
of his own accord, contrary to the Custom. The first time he was
not to be spoken with. The second time, he made an Errant to him
with the three Deputies, to present him a Copy of the Letter from the
Directors of the Company, in the <HI>Persian</HI> Language; at which time he
shew'd them the Deputies, acquainting him withal that those were
the Persons with whom he was to treat in point of Trade. To which
the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> reply'd, that he had no Commission from the King
to meddle with those Deputies, but only, to entertain the <HI>Begzade</HI> that
brought the King's Letter, which he had already done. Thereupon
the Father desir'd him he would be pleas'd to speak to the King to nomi∣nate
Commissioners to treat with them, which the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> pro∣mis'd
to do. That day in the evening, a Messenger was sent to Father
<HI>Raphael,</HI> to acquaint him, that the King had appointed the <HI>Nazar</HI> to
treat with the Deputies the next day, and to know their demands. Of
which the Father gave the Deputies quick intelligence.</P>
<P>The next day, being the First of <HI>September,</HI> Father <HI>Raphael</HI> fail'd not
to be with the Deputies very early in the Morning, to bring them to
the <HI>Nazar;</HI> but he was very much surpriz'd to see, that they would not
go altogether, but still loo'k with an evil Eye one upon another, and
continued their former differences. To the end therefore that he might
set things to rights, he went to the <HI>Nazar,</HI> and told him, that he
thought it would be the best way for the Merchants Deputies to come
<PB N="33" REF="84"/>
first, because that they were the Persons with whom he was chiefly to
Treat. The <HI>Nazar</HI> answer'd, that the King understood that they were
all five in the same Commission joyntly. To which, when the Father
answer'd the second time, that it would be the best way to do as he had
propos'd; The <HI>Nazar</HI> with a Surly Countenance, why, What's the
matter now? said he to the Father; Are not you <HI>French-men</HI> asham'd to
be thus at odds one with another, and to give all the World, nay the
very Foot-boys occasion to discourse of your Divisions? What would
they have us think of them and their Commission? Are they so little afraid
of offending the King? Or, is their King more indulgent then the King
of <HI>Persia,</HI> who would never pardon such faults in his Subjects? To this
rebuke the Father made no reply. Only he desir'd the <HI>Nazar,</HI> that he
might have two Horse-men to attend the Deputies at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> telling the
<HI>Nazar</HI> not a word of his design to bring the Merchants an Hour sooner
then the Gentlemen. This fell out to the Fathers desire; For the Father
sent one of the Horse-men to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> to the Gentlemen, with order to
drink with them, and not to be over hasty, but to bring them fair and
softly along with him; with the other he made hast to the Merchant
Deputies, and causing them to double their pace, they got betimes to
the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s House, where they were civilly receiv'd. <HI>Dupont</HI> presented
the <HI>Nazar</HI> with the Deputies Commission, translated into the <HI>Persian</HI>
Language; after which they fell into a discourse, which lasted above
three quartes of an Hour, concerning the Customs, Tolls, and Qua∣lity
of the Merchants, and the justness of the <HI>French</HI> in their Dealing.
They had just finish'd their Discourse of Trade, when the <HI>Nazar</HI> was
advertiz'd, that the three Gentlemen were arriv'd; who thereupon
desir'd Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to go and receive them. The Father went and
waited upon them in, neatly chiding them for having stay'd so long,
and making the <HI>Nazar</HI> wait. Well said he, now you are together, go
into that Cabinet, and write down your demands, and the Articles
of your Commission. The Merchant Deputies, which had now dis∣cours'd
with the <HI>Nazar</HI> what they had to say, were well enough con∣tent
to enter into a General Conference with the Gentlemen. Then
calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, they made a draught of their Demands,
the chief of which were, three Years Immunity from Customs and
Tolls, to begin from the time of the arrival of our Ships; and that
after that, they should enjoy all the Priviledges and Favours granted to
other Nations. They also desir'd precedence above all other Nations,
when they should be call'd to Court, as they suggested, that they had
at the Court of the Grand Signior. And lastly, they requir'd a House
for those that belong'd to the Company, to live in the City.</P>
<P>These demands were dictated word for word by Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> to the
<HI>Nazars</HI> Secretary, in the Name of all the five Gentlemen; and because
the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s Secretary knew not how to pronounce them, the Father
undertook to write them in the <HI>Persian</HI> Character; which being done,
and the writing read in the hearing of the Deputies, the <HI>Nazar</HI> took
the Paper to present to the King.</P>
<P>Thus after a fair Banquet, accompany'd with Music, both Vocal
and Instrumental, the Deputies were dismiss'd by the <HI>Nazar,</HI> who bid
them rely upon his care; for that he would do them all the Favour that
lay in his pow'r, and give them his Majesties Answer in a short time.
The Deputies very well satisfy'd with the <HI>Nazar</HI>'s reception, sent him
<PB N="34" REF="85"/>
afterwards a Present, which was a Shame both to the Nation and the
Company, that pretended to such great and high things, and endea∣vour'd
to six and opinion of their Wealth and Grandeur among Strangers.
For they sent him only a <HI>Tin Cup</HI> Enamel'd, and eight little Cases of
Perspectives, or Looking-Glasses, the whole not amounting to above
40 Crowns. They also made much such another Present, but meaner,
to the <HI>Mirzateker,</HI> consisting of about a Dozen Pair of Gilt Scissars
for Women. We must speak the Truth: For they were not a little
saught at for their ridiculous Presents, which were the Scorn and
Contempt of those that receiv'd them, when the Deputies were
gone.</P>
<P>To Father <HI>Raphael</HI> they presented a Purse, with 40 <HI>Tomans,</HI> or Six
Hundred Crowns in it, believing that he would never accept of it;
and indeed he refus'd it with scorn; not a little angry with them, that
they should have such mean thoughts of him, as to believe him
Mercenary.</P>
<P>Two days after, the <HI>Nazar</HI> gave notice to the Father, that the King
had granted the <HI>French</HI> their Demands; and had order'd every one of
them a <HI>Calaat,</HI> or a Vest-Royal, and in respect of Superiority, a Horse
for Monsieur <HI>Lalin.</HI> That the Kings Answer and the <HI>Grant</HI> were both
ready for the Directors of the Company, according to their desire.</P>
<P>The King was then onward upon a journey to <HI>Mazandran,</HI> three
days Travel from <HI>Ispahan,</HI> at one of his Palaces, call'd <HI>Tajabat.</HI> A
Pleasant Situation, in the mid'st of a great Valley, shaded with Trees,
and full of Villages.</P>
<P>The Ninth of <HI>October,</HI> came a Letter from the <HI>Nazar,</HI> to Father <HI>Ra∣phael,</HI>
signifying the King's Pleasure, that both he and the Deputies
should repair to <HI>Tajabat</HI> with all speed. Thereupon the Father and they
made such hast, that in less than three days they got to <HI>Tajabat,</HI> where
the <HI>Nazar</HI> order'd them to lye in the House of an <HI>Armenian</HI> Renegado.
The King sent them immediately eight or ten bottles of Wine, with
four Gold Dishes, full of lovely Fruits, and Tapistries for their
Dining Room. But these Presents occasion'd new Quarrels; For there
being two Factions, and both living apart, there was a great dispute
who should have this present. Father <HI>Raphael,</HI> having done all
that possible he could to reconcile the business, and not being able to
persuade them, in a just Passion, bid them take their Swords and Pistols,
and go and decide the Quarrel in the Field. Till now, said he, I have
done all I could to conceal your detestable divisions from the Court,
which nevertheless, is but too well acquainted therewith: Is it your
design to publish your own Ignominy, and to make not only your selves,
but the whole Nation of the <HI>French</HI> ridiculous to the <HI>Persians?</HI> At length
they were so far reconcil'd, that one Room serv'd them to Feed, and
consequently the same Furniture. For the Father's reproofs had put
them a little out of Countenance.</P>
<P>The Seventeenth of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Mehemander</HI> came to the Deputies
Lodgings, and brought five Royal Vests; The Richest, which was of
Tissue of Gold, was for Monsieur <HI>Lalin;</HI> the next, not altogether so
rich, for Monsieur <HI>Boulaye;</HI> and the other three of a lower price, for
the Merchants; The value of the whole might amount to 600 Crowns,
for which the <HI>French</HI> Deputies most generously gave the Officers that
brought them 25 or 30 Crowns, as a Gratuity. The Officers of the
<PB N="35" REF="85"/>
Stable also brought two Horses for the Gentlemen, for which they
receiv'd six Crowns in Gold, as a reward. I confess, I should have been
asham'd of such a poorness of Spirit, at such a time as that.</P>
<P>At length also the <HI>Ragan</HI> or Patent for the Company was deliver'd
into the Hands of the Deputies, faithfully Translated by Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to
this Effect.</P>
<P><Q>That whereas the Merchants of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> who are
favour'd by the Favour extreemly Royal, and the Justice excessively
Royal, being made constant in the hope and participation in the
time, have presented their Petition, which is arriv'd at the Ear
of the Ministers Commissioners for the Court of Grandeur and high
Fortune; Their Intentions and Demands have found the Visage of
Acceptation, and we have strictly commanded, that the Conservatours
of Rights, Tolls and Priviledges, acknowledge them for exempt
and priviledg'd, during the space of Three Years; and that there be
nothing demanded upon their Goods and Factories, conformable to
the request of the Deputies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The next day, the <HI>Mehemander Bachi,</HI> came early in the Morning to
attend the Deputies, and bring them with all speed to the Court:
Where being admitted into the Garden, they met the King a Horse-back,
and all the Court a Foot. The <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> held the King's
Answer to the King of <HI>France,</HI> in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, Seal'd with
the Kings Seal upon red <HI>Spanish</HI> Wax. The Sieur <HI>Lalin</HI> then, and the
rest of the Deputies were order'd to go neer and Kiss the Kings Boot,
who kept his Grandeur, without speaking a word. When they had
so done, the <HI>Athemadoulet</HI> calling them to him, there, said he, there is
the Answer for the <HI>Grand Cha,</HI> that is, for the King of the Kings of
<HI>France.</HI> The Deputies having made their Obeysances to the King, the
whole Court took Horse; and the King took the Road of <HI>Cachan;</HI> and
within an Hour, that Campaign, which look'd like a thick peopl'd
City, became as Desert as the most part of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The Deputies, having read over the Patent, began to find many
defects, and <HI>Mariage</HI> would fain have follow'd the Court for amendments,
and would have persuaded <HI>Lalin</HI> and Father <HI>Raphael</HI> to have gone along
with him. But Father <HI>Raphael</HI> over-persuaded them to retun first to
their Lodgings at <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and there to hear the Patent distinctly read
over, and to consider better of it. When they came to <HI>Zulpha,</HI> and
that they had debated upon the meer Letter of the <HI>Patent,</HI> then they
were worse mad then they were before. Then there were so many
Cavils, so many Disputes, so many Exceptions, and so many Expo∣sitions
put upon the Words <HI>Conformably</HI> and <HI>Reasonably,</HI> that they must
get a Horse back immediately. <HI>Boulaye</HI> stopp'd this fury for a while; So
that after many Disputes and Consultations, it was agreed, that <HI>Mariage,</HI>
as chief of the Negotiation, and <HI>Lalin,</HI> should follow the Court; and
that <HI>Boulaye, Breber,</HI> and <HI>Dupont,</HI> should proceed forward to the <HI>Indies.</HI>
The Sieur <HI>L'Estoile,</HI> and all the rest of the <HI>Franks,</HI> were of opinion,
that <HI>Lalin</HI> should forthwith depart for <HI>France,</HI> with the King's Letter.
But their Counsel was not follow'd, and so the Deputies divided them∣selves:
<HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage</HI> to follow the Court, which was then remov'd
as far as <HI>Mazandran:</HI> And the other three to pursue their Journey to
the East <HI>Indies.</HI> The two former fain would have had Father <HI>Raphael</HI>
have accompany'd them to the Court; but he fairly excus'd himself.
<PB N="36" REF="86"/>
Neither would <HI>L'Estoile</HI> permit his Son, to whom he allow'd 20 <HI>Tomans</HI>
a Year, to return to the Court, choosing rather to send him to <HI>Bander</HI>
with the other three. Whereupon, the Seventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> they
set forward upon their Journey.</P>
<P><HI>Du Pont,</HI> without doubt, was the most solid and judicious of all the
Merchants, but he took it so to heart, to see the dis-union among them,
that he fell into a languishing Disease at <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and dy'd not far from
<HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Lalin</HI> and <HI>Mariage,</HI> they left <HI>Ispahan</HI> the Fifteenth of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI>
and arriv'd at Court soon after, where they lay a long time neg∣lected,
their Divisions still continuing, which made them contempti∣ble
to the <HI>Persians,</HI> and ruin'd the Affairs of the Company. One
Evening, the <HI>Nazar</HI> sent them a Flow'r, advising them, that as that
Flow'r never chang'd; so it became them not to vary in their Resolutions.
After a long and tedious stay, <HI>Mariage</HI> obtain'd some few impertinent
Alterations in his Patent; and permission to make Wine at <HI>Schiras,</HI> as
the <HI>English, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Portugueses</HI> had.</P>
<P>With these Alterations they both leave the Court; and <HI>Mariage</HI>
would certainly have accompany'd <HI>Lalin,</HI> who had an intention to see
<HI>Ardevil, Tauris,</HI> and <HI>Kom,</HI> had he not been solicited to return to <HI>Zul∣pha,</HI>
by a Young <HI>Dalilah,</HI> that had smitten his heart. For by the means
of an old Woman, the Mother of one of his Lacqueys, he had de∣bauch'd
a young <HI>Armenian</HI> Virgin, whom he kept privately to himself;
yet not so privately, but the noise thereof was quickly spread all over
<HI>Zulpha.</HI> All the <HI>Armenians</HI> were scandaliz'd at it, and sent to seize the
Baud, to punish her, by their Laws, as she deserv'd. <HI>Mariage</HI> adver∣tiz'd
thereof, flew out of his Lodging to her assistance, and to protect
her from Justice. But seeing the People in an uproar, and finding the
Stones to flye too thick about his Ears, he was forc'd to mind his own
safety, and to seek for shelter in the next House where he could be ad∣mitted.
But the Business was not so put up, for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> won∣dring
to see that a Deputy of an Illustrious Company, who was come
to the Court of <HI>Persia</HI> upon so serious an Affair, should do so much wrong
to his Nation, by publickly appearing in so shameful an Action, and so
unworthy of a Person in public Employment, that they resolv'd to prose∣cute
him all manner of ways. They were resolv'd, to that end, to have
sent into <HI>France</HI> an Express, to have Complain'd to the King of his ill
Management and bad Behaviour. But <HI>Mariage</HI> at length restor'd the
<HI>Armenian</HI> Girl which he had kept close lock'd up; after which time the
<HI>Armenians</HI> never look'd upon him but with scorn and contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Lalin</HI> being return'd to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> departed thence the <HI>22th</HI> of <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI>
1666. for <HI>Bander,</HI> with a Resolution, to Travel into the <HI>Indies.</HI>
But he fell sick at <HI>Bander,</HI> and thinking to return to <HI>Schiras,</HI> for the
Air's sake, he dy'd by the way at a Village call'd <HI>Bend-Ali.</HI> A Gen∣tleman
endow'd with noble Qualities, and whose Gentile and Generous
behaviour was an honour to his Nation.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth of the same <HI>November, Mariage</HI> also left <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and
departed for <HI>Bander,</HI> with one Father <HI>Mercier,</HI> a <HI>Jesuite,</HI> whom he
took along with him as his Almoner, and <HI>Lewis L'Estoile,</HI> his <HI>Kalmachi,</HI>
or Interpreter: There he stay'd four Months for the arrival of the Ships,
but none coming, and the heats encreasing, he resolv'd to spend the
rest of the Year at <HI>Schiras.</HI> As for the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> and young <HI>L' Estoile,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="86"/>
because there was no Converse but with the people of the Country,
they return'd back to <HI>Ispahan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boulaye</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Suratte</HI> the first of <HI>April,</HI> 1666. Being
come to the <HI>Bar,</HI> they sent to Father <HI>Ambroise,</HI> chief of the Mission of
the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> who presently attended them with a Sloop, which he
had obtain'd of the Governour, and brought them home to the <HI>Capu∣chin</HI>'s
House, where they stay'd till they departed for <HI>Agra.</HI> Some∣time
before was arriv'd there a Merchant of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who had run him∣self
out at heels, and of a <HI>Maronite</HI> Christian was become a <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick, in hopes to patch up his broken Fortune, being in truth a
meer Counterfeit, and a Hypocrite: For these <HI>Levantine</HI> Christians
seldom change their Religion, but upon some motive of Interest; and
when they have got a good Sum together, they presently whip back
again into their own Country, and for a small piece of Money obtain
absolution of their Patriarch. Thus several of the Religious <HI>Franks</HI>
that travel out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>Asia</HI> are often deceiv'd, making a great
noise of their Conversion of the <HI>Levantines,</HI> when the Conversion, at
the bottom, is only an outward Conversion, and a meer piece of Gul∣lery.
Among many others that I could relate, I will only mention
one, of a <HI>Franciscan,</HI> call'd <HI>Paul Stella,</HI> who coming with 400 Crowns,
or thereabouts, in his Pocket, for his subsistance, a <HI>Maronite</HI> smelt him
out, and under the pretence of giving him the Honour of his Conver∣sion
to the Catholick Religion, never left him till he had suck'd him
dry, and turn'd the Channel of his Money. This <HI>Maronite</HI> Merchant
before mention'd, whose Name was <HI>Chelebi,</HI> shew'd himself very zealous
for the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and he had reason enough; for the <HI>Capuchins</HI> of <HI>Aleppo</HI>
had been very serviceable to him, and had help'd him in his Affairs when
they were at the lowest ebb. They were overjoy'd at his arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI>
and gave it out immediately that it was he that had given them Money
for the building their House and Church. But when I came to look
over my Accompts, I found that the Money that had pay'd for the
Ground and a good share of the building, came out of my Purse;
Father <HI>Ambroise</HI> having promis'd that I should be reimburs'd upon my
return to <HI>Paris.</HI> But I never heard more of my Money, nor indeed did
I ever look after it.</P>
<P>The reason why the <HI>Capuchins</HI> were willing that the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant,
who never had disburs'd a Peny, should own the Expences of their
House and Church, is this; because no <HI>Frangui</HI> Christian is permitted
in the <HI>Indies</HI> to enjoy the propriety of Houses, or to make any reparati∣ons
of those which they hire, without the leave of the Governour of
the place. Both the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Companies are only <HI>Lessees</HI> to
the <HI>Indians;</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> having suffer'd from the Christians in seve∣ral
places, where under pretence of repairing or adorning certain
Houses, which they possess'd by way of propriety, they have so well
fortifi'd them, that when the Governours have come to require any
Duties from them, they have made them good so long, till they have
forc'd the Governours to yield to their demands.</P>
<P>So soon as the Deputies were landed at <HI>Surat,</HI> they presently spread
abroad a report, that there were seven or eight Ships belonging to the
<HI>French</HI> Company that would suddainly follow them. The <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant
was overjoy'd to hear the News, and was in great hopes, that by the
favour of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and the advantage which he had of speaking
<PB N="38" REF="87"/>
several of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> Languages, that the greatest part of the <HI>French</HI>
Merchandize would pass through his hands. Upon these hopes he
made great Treats, and presented large Presents to the Deputies, and
maintain'd their Servants at his own Charges. He found the De∣puties
to be sufficiently covetous, but he was still in great expectations,
that his civil Entertainments, and the Presents which they receiv'd
from him, would oblige them to acknowledge his kindness, and that
one day he should find himself repay'd by the management of their busi∣ness;
but he was foully mistaken. For it cost him above 1500 <HI>Rupies,</HI>
part which he spent upon them himself at <HI>Surat,</HI> and partly what his
Nephew furnish'd them withall at <HI>Agra</HI> for their present occasions.</P>
<P>Three or four days after their arrival at <HI>Surat,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> President sent
to visit them by some of his Council, and would have waited on them
himself, but that he lay then ill of the Gout. The <HI>Holland</HI> Commander
did the same with his Council, shewing all the civilities and kindnesses
that lay in his power; and a few days after invited them solemnly to a
great Feast, with as many as they could bring along with them. In
the midst of their Jollity the King's Health was sent about, and after
that, the Prosperity of the <HI>French</HI> Company; which oblig'd <HI>Boulaye</HI> to
begin another Health to the happy Progress of the <HI>Holland</HI> Company.
But when it came to Mr. <HI>Beber</HI>'s turn to drink it, notwithstanding all
that <HI>Boulaye,</HI> and the rest of the Company could say to him, they
could not oblige him to pledge it. Nay, he did worse then this, for
he threw the Glass, Wine, and all at his Feet; and when he had so
done, he rose in a heat from the Table, and after a pitiful manner left
the Company, and went home to his Lodging, though without any
attendance. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were so discreet as to take little notice of
his folly, but remain'd very merry at the Table with Mr. <HI>Boulaye</HI> till
Midnight. But they could not forbear telling their Friends, that they
wonder'd, in regard there were so many discreet and ingenious Men in
<HI>France,</HI> that the Company should make choice of such a Fool for the
management of such an important Affair as he was sent about; and
that they foresaw he would do the Company no small injury.</P>
<P>While the Deputies stay'd at <HI>Surat,</HI> the Governour of the place, at
the request of Father <HI>Ambroise,</HI> entertain'd them, and shew'd them all
the respect that could be shew'd to Strangers. One day that they were
in Discourse together, he told them, that if they would follow his
Counsel, he adviz'd them not to go to Court till their Ships were
arriv'd. But seeing that they were resolv'd to the contrary, he offer'd
them Money, Horses, and Souldiers, to attend them, with Letters
of Recommendation to some of the Grandees of the Court. The <HI>Cha∣bander,</HI>
or Provost of Merchants, made them the same offers that the
Governour had done; all which they refus'd very obstinately. More
then this, they behav'd themselves very ill, in reference to the Presents
which the Governour and the <HI>Cha-Bander</HI> sent them, for they gave
their Servants that carry'd them not a <HI>Doight,</HI> which is look'd upon as a
very dirty action in the <HI>Indies.</HI> For the <HI>Indians</HI> never give their Ser∣vants
any other Wages, then what they get by carrying Presents from
their Masters. And the more they have given them, the more Honour
it is, both for him that receives, and him that sends the Present.</P>
<P>The Deputies then being resolv'd for <HI>Agra,</HI> hir'd their Waynes, and
their Oxen to carry their Luggage, and five and twenty Souldiers for
<PB N="39" REF="87"/>
their Convoy. They likewise made a great noise, of their being
honour'd from so Great a King, and so Noble a Company. Upon
which score, they ought to have had five or six Wains for their Baggage,
every one their <HI>Pallaquin</HI> and a Led-horse, and every one a Flag with
their Arms or their Cyphers, which is the gentile way of Travelling
in <HI>India,</HI> and as I was always wont to travel. But they took but
five and twenty Souldiers, whereas they ought to have hir'd an hundred
and fifty at the rate they talk'd.</P>
<P>But instead of so doing, three Days Journey from <HI>Surat, Beber</HI> began
to quarrel with <HI>Boulaye,</HI> that they had too great a Train at their heels,
for which he blam'd the Advise of Father <HI>Ambroise</HI> and the Merchant
of <HI>Aleppo:</HI> That for his part he would pay for no more than four
Souldiers, and that if he would not send the rest back, he should pay
them himself. Upon which, they agreed to send back the six Souldiers
which the Governour had order'd to attend them as far as <HI>Brampour;</HI>
upon their dismissment, not giving them so much as the Worth of a
Pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Agra,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Chelebi,</HI> the <HI>Aleppo</HI>
Merchant, fail'd not to wait upon them, and to offer them his service.
There was at that time a <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon, whose Name was <HI>James,</HI>
he spake good <HI>Indian,</HI> and was married in the Country to the Daughter
of a <HI>Portugal:</HI> The <HI>Nahab,</HI> the King's Uncle and Grand Vizier, had a
great kindness for this Chirurgeon; and by his procurement it was,
that the Deputies had Audience of <HI>Giafer-Kan,</HI> for so was the <HI>Nahab</HI>
call'd. They requested of him, that by his favour they might present
a Letter from their King to the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> as also that they might
be admitted to treat concerning the Settlement of a <HI>French</HI> Trade in the
Countrey. The <HI>Nahab</HI> told them, that he would speak to the King,
and take care that they should be admitted to their Audience in a little
time. With that he order'd them to be conducted to the Lodgings
appointed for them, which they found ready furnish'd with all necessary
provision for the Belly; but their Lacqueys and Servants were to cook
it themselves; for it is not here as it is in <HI>Persia,</HI> where the Meat is sent
ready drest out of the King's Kitchin to the Embassadors Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nahab,</HI> who understood that they had brought no Presents,
neither for him, nor any of the Grandees of the Court, nor for
the King himself, was not over hasty to admit them to their Audience.
So that it was above a Month before the Deputies could set Eyes upon
the <HI>Nahab</HI> again, though the Chirurgeon, and other <HI>Franguis,</HI> us'd all
their Interest in their behalf. Being very weary of this Delay, they
gave it out, that they could stay no longer at <HI>Agra,</HI> in regard they
were to be at <HI>Surat</HI> upon the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Vessels. Upon
which false Report, the <HI>Nahab</HI> sent to them for the King their Master's
Letter, that he might present it to the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> himself. Upon this
Demand of their Letter, they were quite blank, not being acquainted
with the manner how the Kings of <HI>India</HI> receive those Letters which
are brought them by Embassadors: For they never receive any with
their own hands, but such as come from the <HI>Grand Signior:</HI> All other
Letters, according to the Grandeur of the Kings that send them, are
put into the hands of the Grand Officers of the Court, who present
them to the King: And the more potent the King is, from whom the
Letter comes, through the fewer hands it passes before it is presented
<PB N="40" REF="88"/>
to the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI> For the present State of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> is very
well known in the Court of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the Difference
between the Soveraigns of both, in reference to their Grandeur and
Puissance. Neither is there a Stranger that enters into the Kingdom,
of whom the Governour of the Frontier Province does not give advice
to the <HI>Nahab;</HI> and if he appear to be a person of Ingenuity, there's
no help for't, but he must go to Court, where he is caress'd, on
purpose to get information of the Country from whence he comes.</P>
<P>But to return to the Deputies, they obstinately refus'd to send the
Letter to the <HI>Nahab:</HI> At which he was not a little troubl'd; fearing lest
upon the Arrival of the <HI>French</HI> Vessels, it might be the occasion of a
Rupture, and hinder the conclusion of the Treaty of Commerce.
Moreover he was not a little jealous, lest they should seize upon the
<HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Vessels in their Voyage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> as <HI>Hugh Lambert</HI> the
<HI>Holland</HI> Pyrat did, who took all the Baggage belonging to the Queen
of <HI>Visapour,</HI> when she was going to <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Medina.</HI> The <HI>Nahab</HI>
having made these Reflexions to himself, so wrought with the King,
that he consented that the Deputies, contrary to custom, should be
admitted into his presence, there to give the Letter into the Hands of
the Prime Minister, to be by him presented to the King. This, as I said
before, was an unusual favour; and yet the Deputies were so obstinate,
as to reject this Proposition, saying, that they would rather return
home, and carry back their Letters, then not present them to the King
themselves. This obstinacy of theirs, to maintain their own conceited
humour against the Custom of the Countrey, was very much blam'd
by all people, that admir'd at the patience of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who at
length sent them word, they might take their own course, since they
refus'd the Honours which he would have done them. After that,
the Deputies staid ten or twelve days in the City, flattering themselves,
that the <HI>Nahab</HI> would comply with their Folly; but they were deceiv'd.
For the <HI>Nahab</HI> offended at their idle carriage, took such order, that
not one person living, either Merchant or other, went to visit them
all the while. So that they resolv'd to return to <HI>Surat,</HI> in expectation
of their Ships.</P>
<P>When they left <HI>Agra,</HI> they went and lay two Leagues off from the
City in the Field, setting up one Tent apiece, (and those pitiful ones
Heaven knows) to serve for them and their Servants, whereas they
might have lodg'd with more security in a fair Inn that stood not far
off. Now it is the Custom at the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Court, that every
Night some Prince or great Lord keeps Guard in his turn for a Week
together, having under him five or six thousand Horse, that beat the
Road for three or four Leagues round the place where the King quarters.
A Party of these Horsemen scouting by the Deputies Tents, and
enquiring whose they were, one of the Servants reply'd, that they were
the Tents of the <HI>French</HI> Deputies: of which the Horsemen gave
immediate notice to their Captain, at that time the Grand Provost of
the Empire. A Person handsom, well endow'd, and a great Lover of
Strangers, who had rais'd himself by his Valour, as being an <HI>Abyssin</HI>
by Nation. So s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="broken" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n as he understood that they were the <HI>French</HI> Deputies,
he sent one of his principal Officers, with fifty Horse, to desire them
to give them leave to guard them that Night, because they were in no
security, and for that if they came to any mischief the Head of their
<PB N="41" REF="88"/>
Captain must answer for it. But they very ill receiv'd the kind proffer
of the Provost, proudly answering, that they were strong enough to
guard themselves, and the first that came near them should know whe∣ther
the <HI>French</HI> had Courage or no, adding withal, that if their Captain
were afraid, they would guard him, with a deal of other scurrilous riffraff
which very much surpriz'd the Officers.</P>
<P>The next day they set up their Tents about a quarter of a League far∣ther,
because they expected something to be brought them from <HI>Agra.</HI>
The <HI>Conteval</HI> or Grand Provost admiring they made such slow journeys,
and that they had now pitch'd in a more dangerous place then before,
sent the same Horsemen with the same proffer, or else that they would
be pleas'd to lye in an Inn where they might be safe. <HI>Boulaye</HI> was of the
mind that so kind an offer should not be refus'd: but <HI>Beber</HI> gave them
nothing but bad language; reviling their Captain, that he was afraid
they should go and lye with his wives, offering if he pleas'd to go and
guard them. He spoke half Portuguese, half Italian, which being a kind
of <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> some of the Horsemen made a shift to understand him,
and having made a report to the Grand Provost of his Insolent Answer,
the Lord was not a little nettl'd at it, and therefore resolv'd to be re∣veng'd.
About midnight fourscore or a hundred Horse came and cut
all the Cords of <HI>Bebers</HI> Tent, thinking to have let it fall about his ears. But
he found a way to quit himself by the assistance of his Servant; and en∣deavour'd
to escape to the House of a <HI>Dervich</HI> on the other side of a small
Rivolet, nere the place where the Tents were set up. But the Moon
shining as bright as day, he could not hide himself from the pursuit of
the Horsemen, who shot at him, and with their Arrows wounded him
in three places, once in the thigh and twice in the buttocks. <HI>Bou∣laye</HI>
hearing the noise which the Horsemen made, peep'd out of his Tent,
and seeing so many Horsemen in pursuit of <HI>Beber,</HI> was not a little daunt∣ed.
He was afraid of running the same <HI>risco;</HI> but not having long to
consider, he took his purse of Duckets, and fled till he got about half a
league off, where he lay all night under a great Tree. But by the con∣sequence
he found that the Horsemen had nothing to say to him; being
satisfi'd when they saw <HI>Beber</HI> fall, as believing him dead. For had they
not thought him so, they would never have left him, till they had quite
done his business. But to colour the business, that it might not seem
a point of revenge they broke open all <HI>Beber</HI>'s Chests; that it might seem
as if he had bin robb'd; but they found very little or nothing to enrich
themselves.</P>
<P>So soon as <HI>Beber</HI>'s boy saw that the Horsemen were gone, he ran to the
Town for a <HI>Pallanquin</HI> to carry his Master thither. Being brought to
the Town they laid him in the Jesuits house, where <HI>Boulaye</HI> also arriv'd
not long after and took up his Quarters, to the great consolation of the
Jesuits, whose Revenues are but small in those parts, where there are
no devout people to leave them Legacies. Their Ordinary was very
sparing; but it was such as the Deputies must be glad of. Though it
were a feast for <HI>Boulaye,</HI> who was not wont to make better chear. For a
Sheeps head, of his own purchase, usually serv'd him two meals. Which
made him ridiculous to the <HI>Franks,</HI> who liv'd after a more splendid rate.
At <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> when he was not invited by the <HI>Franguis,</HI> he had
recourse to his Sheeps tongues, or a cold piece of double Tripe, which
he carri'd to the poor <HI>Cabaretts</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> taking his Chopin of Wine
<PB N="42" REF="89"/>
to wash it down: and such was his good husbandry that what was left
was order'd to be set up for his supper. One day he had drank a little more
then he had bled, and the <HI>Franguis</HI> found him a sleep in the street, about
a hundred paces from the Cabaret. They had so much charity for him as
to remove him to his lodging, lest other Nations should laugh at the
choice which they had made of an Envoy to settle the Trade of such a
considerable Company. As for <HI>Beber,</HI> who lov'd good Chear when it
cost him nothing, as being a true exemplar of covetousness, he com∣plain'd
of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> entertainment, though they out-run the Constable to
treat him like a Deputy. His man who had more wit than he, and plainly
saw what a trouble he was to his Hosts, made them a merry relation of
the Noble Table which his Master kept for him, how he had made pro∣vision
of a Barrel of Herrings; which when Invitations fail'd, he wa∣rily
fed upon, rubbing his bread with the tail to give it a <HI>haut goust.</HI> For
my part, said the Boy, I am but a poor Servant, yet I have made a shift
to spend an hundred and fifty Crowns which I had got in the service of
the Consul of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> 'Twas my misfortune to be inveigl'd out of his
service, for I was with a Noble Master where I got Money; but in this
man's service I have eaten all that I had got before. Two days after I
arriv'd at <HI>Agra,</HI> and heard of <HI>Beber</HI>'s being wounded and where he lay, and
went to give him a visit. And as I never went unprovided in my travels
with all things necessary, I had some Oyntments and Plasters, which
were very serviceable to him.</P>
<P>It was an easie thing to observe that <HI>Boulaye</HI> was glad of the opportu∣nity
of <HI>Beber</HI>'s being wounded, that he might have the sole honour of
giving the Letter to the King. For he pretended to be the true <HI>Envoy</HI>
from the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that <HI>Beber</HI> was only sent to bear him com∣pany.
<HI>La Boulaye</HI> therefore believing that the business would take effect,
persuaded the Chyrurgion already mention'd to solicit the <HI>Nahab</HI> who
had a kindness for him, so close, that thereby the <HI>Nahab</HI> permitted him
to bring the Letter. But <HI>Boulaye</HI> who thought he should give it himself
to the King, was much surpriz'd when he saw that the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who had
got the Letter into his own power, gave it to one of the meanest Officers
of his Court, who by the Prime Minister's order, gave it to another,
and he to a third, who brought it back to the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who at length pre∣sented
it to the King, but not in the presence of <HI>Boulaye.</HI></P>
<P>And thus you see the Effect of the ridiculous pride of the Deputies,
<HI>Boulaye</HI> was forc'd to stay in an outer Court, having two more to pass
thorough before he came into the King's Quarter. Where, while he re∣main'd
big with expectation, word was brought him, that the King
would return an Answer to the King his Master, so soon as the Ships
should be arriv'd; and so he was forc'd to go back to his Lodging with
the melancholy dissatisfaction of a frustrate hope.</P>
<P>The wounded Gentleman being new cur'd, but still very lame, de∣sir'd
Audience of the <HI>Nahab,</HI> that he might have justice for the mis∣chief
done him by an Assassination and a Robbery. The <HI>Nahab</HI> readily
admitted him, limping when he came into his presence worse then
when he first left his bed. The first Compliment he made was of the
Wounds he had receiv'd, and then he demanded satisfaction for the loss
of his Blood, and the Goods which had bin stolen from him. The <HI>Na∣hab</HI>
promis'd him to inform the King of the business, assuring him that
he should have no wrong done him upon the high-way within the Ter∣ritories
<PB N="43" REF="89"/>
where he had to do. Four or five days after, the <HI>Nahab</HI> sent to
<HI>Beber</HI> to know how much the Loss which he pretended to have receiv'd
amounted to. <HI>Beber</HI> brought in an account of four and twenty thousand
<HI>Roupies,</HI> or 12000 Crowns, and for the loss of his Blood, he left it to the
Kings Generosity.</P>
<P>His Accompt he made out thus:</P>
<P><HI>Imprimis.</HI> A Note for the value of six thousand <HI>Roupies</HI> which he had
lent a Merchant when he departed for <HI>Marseilles,</HI> which Note was among
the Papers he had lost. As to that, the <HI>Nahab</HI> ask'd him whether the No∣taries
in <HI>France</HI> did not make an Entry of such publick Acts as were sign'd
before them▪ <HI>Beber</HI> made answer, that he should never be paid, if he could
not produce the same Paper that had bin taken from him, and that he
could not demand his Money without it. The <HI>Nahab</HI> replying; that
that was contrary to the Custom of all Nations, and that he knew it could
not be as he said, added withal, that he should take no care for his satis∣faction
in that particular. After that he read on.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Five thousand <HI>Roupies</HI> in Gold and Silver Money.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Four thousand <HI>Roupies</HI> in Gold Lace and Galoon to trim his
Clothes.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Two Diamond Rings at two thousand one hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Two other Rings, a Topaz, and another of sea-green water,
which cost three hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> His Clothes, his Linnen, and for a Chest of Medicaments,
which might be worth 4000 <HI>Roupies;</HI> of which he had procur'd his Chi∣rurgeon
to give in a Bill.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> A Chain of Gold valu'd at 500 <HI>Roupies.</HI> In all amounting to 24000
<HI>Roupies,</HI> as I said before.</P>
<P>Two or three days after, the King caus'd an Order to be deliver'd to
him for the payment of his Money at the Treasury-Chamber. Upon
which Order, he agreed with a Merchant to be paid at <HI>Surat.</HI> And when
he was ready to depart, the King commanded 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> to be paid
him for the loss of his Blood. But that sum he never receiv'd. For be∣ing
in haste to be gone to <HI>Surat,</HI> and failing to present the <HI>Treasurer,</HI> he
drill'd him out so long, that his patience was quite tir'd, and so he was
forc'd to go without it.</P>
<P>I could never understand the Policy of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> to pay <HI>Beber</HI>
the sum which he said had bin taken from him; when the <HI>Nahab</HI> knew
to a thread what he had lost, and had given in an accompt thereof to the
King; the whole not amounting to 2000 <HI>Roupies.</HI> And as for the <HI>Fran∣guis,</HI>
so soon as they understood that he had demanded 4000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for
his Chirurgeons Chest, they all cry'd out that it was a meer cheat. For
a few days before <HI>Beber</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Agra,</HI> the Chirurgeon had receiv'd 200
<HI>Roupies</HI> by the Charity of the <HI>Franks</HI> to return to <HI>Surat,</HI> and he fell sick
the next day that this Bill was presented to the <HI>Nahab.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Mogul</HI> had read the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter, the <HI>Nahab</HI> by
order of his Master, order'd a Lodging to be provided for the Deputies,
which overjoy'd the Jesuits, who were by that means rid of two very
troublesome Guests. As for <HI>Boulaye,</HI> in regard the King had signifi'd his
pleasure, that he would not return any answer to the King's Letter till
the arrival of the Ships, he never troubled himself any farther▪ but
staid till the waters were fallen, that he might go to <HI>Bengale,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Golconda</HI> to settle a Trade in those parts. But <HI>Beber</HI> moil'd like
<PB N="44" REF="90"/>
a horse, and did nothing but run to and fro, to know the King's pleasure
touching the settlement of Trade. But the <HI>Nahab</HI> either laugh'd at him,
or took little notice of what he said. For indeed by <HI>Beber</HI>'s outward
appearance, and deportment, no man could make any other judgment
of him, but that he was a poor spirited fellow, and one that knew not
what it was to live. For all the <HI>Europeans</HI> that travel into <HI>Persia</HI> and the
<HI>Indies</HI> are always richly habited, nor would any of them keep <HI>Beber</HI>
company, who by his Habit look'd rather like a Footman, than a Depu∣ty
of a Royal Company of Trade. At length a whim took him to
make himself a suit of painted Calicut, after the <HI>French</HI> Fashion, the
like whereof had never been seen in the Country; the whole Suit not
standing him in above 13 <HI>Livres</HI> and 13 <HI>Sous.</HI> For the trimming of his
new Suit he took off the Ribbands of his old Cloaths, which he was two
days lathering, and smoothing with a Taylers Goose. When he had
got this rare Habit upon his back, he went to visit the <HI>Nahab,</HI> who was
then attended by the Principal Lords of the Court. Who when they
saw him enter, fell all a gazing upon him, and ask'd one another whe∣ther
that <HI>Frangui</HI> were turn'd <HI>Faquir,</HI> or a <HI>Dervich</HI> of <HI>Hossen Mamout,</HI>
which they usually call the ragged <HI>Saint.</HI> For you must know, that all
the <HI>Faquirs</HI> or <HI>Derviches</HI> that are of this Order, never apparel themselves
but with such rags as they pick up in the streets, and if they meet with
any pieces better than other, they make of them a kind of Galoon to
trim the rest. They also carry half Pikes, with a great company of
Tatters fasten'd to the end of them, to make a shew of their beggery. <HI>Be∣ber</HI>'s
Habit very much surpriz'd the <HI>Nahab,</HI> and all others that beheld
him so ridiculously accouter'd. As he pass'd one morning by my win∣dow,
I bid him good morrow, telling him withal, that he look'd more
spruce and gay than he us'd to do. He reply'd, that he had reason so to
do, for that he had receiv'd Letters from <HI>Surat,</HI> by which he had advice,
that the Country people upon the Coast of <HI>Cape St. John</HI> had decry'd
four Vessels out at Sea, which they could not make to be either <HI>English,</HI>
or <HI>Hollanders,</HI> from whence he concluded that they were the Companies
ships; and that he was going to the <HI>Nahab</HI> with the News. But I pre∣vented
him at that time, telling him that I had often observ'd that rascally
sort of people to come both to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with such kind of
Intelligence, on purpose to get Money; when indeed they had never
seen any such sight, and admonishing him not to believe Reports upon
such slight foundations. I ask'd him what date his Letters bore? he
told me, thirty days ago. Then, said I, if the discovery had bin true,
the <HI>Nahab</HI> would have had notice of it in fourteen; and then he would
certainly have told you of it, or my self; for it is but two days since I took
my leave of him. Thereupon he took my counsel and resolv'd for <HI>Surat</HI>
in a few days.</P>
<P>Three days after that the Chirurgeon had given in his Bill for the
Chest of Medicaments that he had lost among <HI>Beber</HI>'s Baggage, he was
so touch'd in Conscience, that he fell sick, and dy'd in two days. Upon
his death-bed he ask'd pardon of God for the Cheat which he had con∣sented
to, to ask 4000 <HI>Roupies</HI> for that which was really worth but four
hundred; 200 of which he had receiv'd from the Charity of the <HI>Fran∣guis,</HI>
the rest upon the sale of a Horse.</P>
<P>For my part, finding that <HI>Beber</HI> was resolv'd for <HI>Surat,</HI> I made what
hast I could out of <HI>Agra,</HI> to be quit of his company. But the second
<PB N="45" REF="90"/>
day after my departure, having set up my tent by a Rivers side, just as I
was going to dinner I spy'd <HI>Beber</HI> coming, nor could I get rid of him
afterwards till I came to <HI>Surat.</HI> So that we were forc'd to travel toge∣ther,
though he committed a thousand Impertinencies by the way.
Among the rest, he put one trick upon the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> or
Bankers at <HI>Brampour,</HI> not to be passed over in silence.</P>
<P>In regard the ways were bad, and that he had but one pitiful weak
Chariot, and four weak Boys, which with the help of Oxen, were
hardly strong enough to help him out when he stuck in the mire, he sel∣dom
came to his journeys end till two or three hours after me. Now upon
the report that ran of the <HI>French</HI> ships being seen out at Sea▪ and
the general belief that <HI>Beber</HI> would be one of the Principal Trustees
of the Company, several, as I said before, courted him, and sought to
engage his Friendship. Being arriv'd at <HI>Brampour,</HI> the Chief of the
<HI>Cheraffs,</HI> attended by a dozen of his servants came to visit us. Upon the
first acquaintance <HI>Beber</HI> told him that he wanted a <HI>Pallaquin</HI> to go to <HI>Su∣rat,</HI>
whereupon the <HI>Cheraff</HI> civilly offered him his, and caus'd it to be
trimm'd up for his better accommodation. <HI>Beber</HI> thought that trimming
would have bin finisht in one day, when indeed it requir'd three or four.
The next day I order'd my Coach to be got ready, and order'd my <HI>Pal∣laquin</HI>
to be carri'd away. <HI>Beber,</HI> who verily believ'd that the Compa∣ny's
ships were already in the Road of <HI>Surat,</HI> began to curse and bann
the <HI>Cheraff,</HI> who presently came to him and endeavour'd to appease him
with good words. He told him, it could be no prejudice to him to stay
a day or two; for by that time the Roads would be better, and he might
travel the faster. But <HI>Beber,</HI> being transported with passion, was so
far from taking the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> reasons for satisfaction, that snatching a
Cudgel out of his Waggoners hands that stood next to him, he gave
the <HI>Cheraff</HI> three or four good Licks cross the shoulders. The Merchants
and other people that were in the Inn, were strangely surpriz'd at such a
piece of rudeness, and ran out presently, some with Stones, and others
with Cudgels, making a hideous noise, and crying out, that they had
never seen the like. They took it for a most enormous Crime, to strike
the Chief of the <HI>Cheraffs,</HI> above fourscore years old, whose very age
ought to have bin protection enough from such an Affront. Good luck
it was for <HI>Beber,</HI> after such a rash action committed, that I was well
known at <HI>Brampour,</HI> having been there ten or twelve times, and in some
of my Travels having dealt for above 200000 <HI>Roupies.</HI> There were
none of the <HI>Cheraffs</HI> with whom I had not dealt by Letters of Exchange,
and very few Merchants or Brokers who had not had some business or
other upon my accompt. They cry'd out, speaking of me; See there the
Monsieur <HI>Franqui,</HI> with whom we have dealt so often, yet never heard
him give us an ill word. Another good chance he had to meet there
the <HI>Coutevall</HI>'s Lieutenant, and three Merchants of <HI>Surat;</HI> and thus be∣tween
us, having disingag'd <HI>Beber</HI> out of the Brabble wherein he had
so sillily bemir'd himself, we made him get into my Coach, and so packt
him out of the City. I follow'd him two hours after: for had he staid
longer in <HI>Brampour,</HI> I believe the <HI>Faquirs</HI> and <HI>Derviches</HI> would have beat
out his brains. For he was no sooner gone, but a great number of that
sort of rabble came to the Inn, crying out, Where was that Dog of a
<HI>Cafer</HI> that had beaten the <HI>Cheraff.</HI> Thereupon, seeing the Multitude
encrease, I stole out of the Town, without saying a word, and rid on
<PB N="46" REF="91"/>
till I got three leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> to an old Town call'd <HI>Badelpoura,</HI>
where I overtook <HI>Beber,</HI> who had hir'd a Coach made after the fashion
of the Country. It was but reason, that I should have my own Coach
to sleep in in the night: For though in all places where you come to lye
in the night, the <HI>Indians</HI> will offer you a little bed to lye on, yet in re∣gard
the rains were but just over, the bedsteads were so full of Puhies,
that there was no resting. These Punies are ingender'd by the moisture
which the rains, that fall for four months together, cause in those Coun∣tries.
Which being over, and the Sun recovering its wonted heat, the
women carry forth their beds every morning, and beating them, well
with good big sticks, never leave till the Punies fall to the ground, and
there turning up their bellies presently dye. These beds consist of four
feet and four round stayes, as broad and as long as you please. To the
staves are fasten'd girths about four fingers broad, which are much more
commodious than the bottoms of our beds that are plank'd with Deal
or other wood. Over the girths they only lay a single Coverlet or
Sheet, which is a manner of lying easie enough, considering the heat of
the Country.</P>
<P>The fourth day after our departure from <HI>Brampour,</HI> being near a great
Town call'd <HI>Semqueles,</HI> in a flat Country, we perceiv'd all the Plain co∣ver'd
with Tents. It appear'd to be the Camp of one of the chief <HI>Kans,</HI>
or Lords, whom the <HI>Great Mogull</HI> had sent with 50000 men against the
Rebel <HI>Raja Sevagi.</HI> This Lord, understanding who we were, very ci∣villy
sent us Melons, and Mango's, and bid his Officers tell us withal,
that we were out of all danger, and might safely pursue our journey.
Whatever I could say to <HI>Beber,</HI> to perswade him that it was but an act
of civility and good manners, to wait upon the Prince, I could by no
means engage him. I seeing his impertinency, shifted my habit, and
sent one of my servants to the Camp, to learn whether the <HI>Kan</HI> drank
Wine; and understanding that he did, I took a bottle of <HI>Spanish,</HI> and
another of <HI>Schirus</HI> Wine, and a small pocket Pistol delicately embel∣lish'd
with silver; and with this small Present away I went to wait upon
the General. Being come into his Presence, I excus'd <HI>Beber,</HI> as not
being well, and immediately presented him the little Pistol, which he
took, and bid me charge, being desirous to try it. After he had shot it
off, said he to his Lords that stood by, Now must we confess these <HI>Fran∣qui's</HI>
to be ingenious. This man sees that I am going to the Wars, and
presents me wherewithal to desend my life. Then casting his eyes
upon the little Hamper, where the Bottles were, he ask'd what it was?
They told him in his Ear. Oh, said he, looking at the same time upon
two or three <HI>Mim Bachi's,</HI> or Colonels that were present, This <HI>Franqui</HI>
Gentleman has given me a bottle of Wine, well we must drink it;
for I find I shall please him in so doing. When the <HI>Mollah's</HI> heard him
talk of Wine, they slunk away; which made the <HI>Kan</HI> laugh heartily.
These are <HI>Agi's,</HI> quoth he; they have bin Pilgrims to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and never
drink Wine after they come home again. Having taken my leave, he
sent me a <HI>Pomere,</HI> which is a kind of Scarf that may also serve for a
Girdle. It was made of white Sattin with flow'rs of Gold, and might
be worth about a hundred <HI>Roupies.</HI> He that brought it, told me, I
should do the <HI>Kan</HI> a great kindness, to send him another bottle of Wine:
thereupon I sent him two of three, which was all my store. He sent
me six Horsemen to conduct us three days journey, till we had pass'd a
<PB N="47" REF="91"/>
great River that flows from the Mountains of the South, which wash∣ing
the City of <HI>Baroche,</HI> from whence it takes its Name, falls into the
Bay of <HI>Cambay.</HI></P>
<P>When we came to our last stage, which is a great Town, call'd <HI>Bar∣noli,</HI>
from whence it is but 14 Leagues to <HI>Surat, Beber</HI> sent one of his
Hirelings to give notice thereof to Father <HI>Ambrose.</HI> When the News
came, the Father went with the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant, often already men∣tion'd,
to borrow the <HI>English</HI> President's Coaches: and there were about
15 or 16 more Coaches all in a train, with several Horsemen and Mer∣chant
<HI>Banians</HI> that made hast to meet the Deputy. This happen'd
upon the first of <HI>November,</HI> 1666. They carri'd with them Provision
enough to make merry, and every <HI>Banian</HI> had his Present ready. For
my part, I as soon as I had saluted the Father Capuchin, I went directly
to my Lodging, where I had left two Servants to take care of a Sum of
Money which I had receiv'd of the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> unwilling to hazard
it upon the Road. For in whatever part of the <HI>Indies</HI> I came, I had
credit enough to buy without Money. I only gave my Bills for payment
at <HI>Agra, Visapour, Golconda,</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> where I generally left my Money,
as having receiv'd it there for the most part of the Lords or Kings of the
Country.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Beber,</HI> he was no Changeling, the follies that he committed
are too numerous to be related: but how he began the year 1667, is not
to be omitted.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Thevenot,</HI> upon his return from <HI>Madraspatan</HI> and <HI>Golconda,</HI> lodg'd
in the Capuchins house. <HI>Beber</HI> going to visit him, told him, that the
Capuchins were the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Spies, and that he had often advis'd
Father <HI>Ambrose</HI> to break with them, and not to go any more to their
House. That while he frequented their Society, the <HI>French</HI> Company
would be sure to find some obstacle in their Trade when the Ships should
arrive; and that if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had not been at <HI>Agra,</HI> they might have
done what they pleas'd with the King. That the hundred thousand
<HI>Roupies</HI> which they had presented to the King and Grandees of the Court,
had hinder'd them from obtaining what they design'd. By which it
appear'd, he understood not the humour of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> for they are
not so liberal: nor would all their tricks, or presents have any thing
avail'd them, the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> being desirous that all Nations should be
welcome to his Dominions, especially Merchants, as well they that
import little, as they that bring in much. M. <HI>Thevenot</HI> told him, that
he had never observ'd so much of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in all his travels; for if
it were true, that they had such a desire to hinder the Trade of other
Nations, they would not afford them passage in their Ships, or to put
their Goods aboard, as they often did. Moreover, they send away many
times one or two Ships according to the quantity, laden all with stran∣gers
Goods, from <HI>Maslipatan</HI> or <HI>Surat,</HI> in which Ships, there is not oft∣times
so much as one Bale belonging to the Company. And this, added
he, is farther observable, That they afford their Freight cheaper then
the <HI>English,</HI> or any other Nation, who have Ships in these parts. Thus
Monsieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> endeavour'd to convince M. <HI>Beber;</HI> who would have
had Father <HI>Ambrose</HI> have fallen out with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But he knew
better things then to disoblige persons to whom he was so much behold∣ing
as he was every day. For every week they allow'd the house a
certain quantity of Bread and Meat, and upon Fast-days sent them Fish,
<PB N="48" REF="92"/>
Eggs, Brandy, and Wine, which were no such unkindnesses to be
quarrell'd with. Monsieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> at the same time told <HI>Beber,</HI> that
he should do well to repay Father <HI>Ambrose</HI> the Money which he had
borrow'd to pay for the Coach which he had broken to serve him, as
also that which he had given the Seamen, for trying if they could
discover the <HI>Companies</HI> Vessels upon the Coast. But he turn'd his deaf
ear to that discourse, and would never be persuaded to reimburse the
Money which Father <HI>Ambrose</HI> laid out for him. Monsieur <HI>Thevenot</HI>
perceiving his unwillingness, and pressing him to do things handsomly,
put him into such a chase, that he fell a swearing after such a violent rate,
in a Parlour, that was parted only by a thin board from the place where
the Mass was said, that one of the Fryers, just ready to go to the Altar,
came forth to desire him to leave his blaspheming. But <HI>Beber</HI>'s insolence
took his admonition so ill, that he very rudely beat the Fryer in Mr. <HI>The∣venot</HI>'s
presence; swearing, That had it not been out of respect to him,
he would have knockt him o' the head. The Capuchin being so inju∣riously
us'd, came to Me, being hardly able to stir his neck, by reason
of one of the blows that <HI>Beber</HI> had given him. I chaft his neck with
Oyl of Coco's, and wrapt it up warm: but we durst not speak a word
of <HI>Beber</HI>'s idle action, for fear of exposing our selves to the laughter of
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who would have made good sport with it.
Besides these Enormities, he put away his Servant that had sav'd his
Life, and kept his Wages. After that he went to lye at an Apothe∣caries
house, whose Name was <HI>Mouillon,</HI> who came from <HI>Goa,</HI> with a
good quantity of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine, and kept a Tavern at <HI>Surat.</HI> While
he lay there he had a great Contest with the Merchant, who receiv'd
the 24000 <HI>Roupies,</HI> which the King had given him for the loss which he
alleadg'd that he and his Chyrurgeon had sustain'd. For the Merchant
would acknowledge the receipt of no more then 23900 <HI>Roupies,</HI> the
other Hundred being deducted for Fees of the Treasury. He also main∣tain'd,
That the Merchant had receiv'd the 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> which the King
had allow'd him for the loss of his Blood: but it was known that the
Grand Treasurer would never pay that Money. Thus when he saw that
his Cheats were discover'd to all the World, he began to bethink him∣self
how to get away: and we observ'd, that he would fain have quitted
<HI>Surat</HI> without noise. But there is such good Order taken both by Land
and Sea, that no person can go away without the knowledge and leave
of the Governour. For as the Countrymen that come from the other
side of the water cannot return unless they shew a mark in their hands
made with red Earth at the Custom-house; neither Horse nor Coach
can stir without a Note from the <HI>Chabander,</HI> and another for the <HI>Ra∣dars,</HI>
who lye sometimes two or three Leagues from the Town. <HI>Beber</HI>
nevertheless had some assurance from his Vintner, that he might get
into a Boat, by bidding the Boatmen carry him to <HI>Reynel,</HI> a large Town
on the other side of the water. The Master of the Boat ask'd him for
his Ticket, but <HI>Beber</HI> answer'd him with his Cudgel, forcing him for∣ward,
and telling him, he was not to demand Billets of such a person as
he was. As he was got half way the River a great number of Souldiers
hollow'd after the Boatmen, to row the Strangers back ashoar. But
<HI>Beber</HI> laid his hand upon his Sword, and compell'd the Boatmen to go
forward. That evening, <HI>Beber</HI> being return'd, the poor Boatmen were
apprehended, and bastinado'd till they were almost maim'd. The
<PB N="49" REF="92"/>
people cri'd out, that it was the <HI>Frangui</HI> that ought to be so serv'd, and not
the poor Watermen, who had done nothing but by constraint.</P>
<P>Thus did this Envoy behave himself both in <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> to the
great hindrance of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. Now let us see what became of
both <HI>Boulaye</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> after all their Extravagancies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sieur de la Boulaye,</HI> according to the accompt given by the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI>
that were at <HI>Agra,</HI> left the Town five or six days after my departure.
Knowing I went to <HI>Surat,</HI> he had plaid his game so well with me, that
he got a Hamper of twelve large bottles of Wine for 138 <HI>Roupies,</HI> though
they cost me more, for which he gave me a Note of his hand, that I
have still in my custody, to be paid at <HI>Surat,</HI> upon the arrival of the
<HI>French</HI> Companies ships. From thence he travell'd to <HI>Patna,</HI> where he
staid nine or ten days, partly with the <HI>English,</HI> partly with the <HI>Hollan∣ders:</HI>
from whence he departed for <HI>Daca,</HI> the Residence of the Governour
of the Province. The Governour of the Province of <HI>Bengale</HI> was
then the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Uncle, whose name was <HI>Cha-Est-Kan,</HI> a potent
Prince, who has always under his Command thirty or forty thousand
men.</P>
<P>At <HI>Patna, Boulaye</HI> had a project, that from thence he might easily pass
into <HI>China,</HI> and to that purpose he there embarqu'd with some <HI>Persian</HI>
Souldiers, who were going to list themselves under <HI>Cha-Est-Kan.</HI> But
after that, to this hour, it never could be certainly known what became
of him: but by all probable conjectures, it is verily believ'd, that the
<HI>Persian</HI> Souldiers murder'd him and his little Slave, in hopes of some
good booty. Of the truth whereof, the Observation that follows was
no small evidence. About a quarter of a mile from <HI>Daca</HI> lies a Town,
where five several mungrel <HI>Portugal</HI> Officers, belonging to the Gover∣nour
of <HI>Bengale,</HI> as Canoneers and Carpenters, and some of the same
Nation that serve in the Cavalry of <HI>Cha-Est-Kan.</HI> There they have also
a small Church very well built, where an <HI>Austin</HI> Fryar officiates, to
whom, about three months after <HI>Boulaye</HI>'s departure from <HI>Patna,</HI> a cer∣tain
<HI>Persian</HI> in the Habit of a Souldier, with two more companions,
brought two large Books, the one in <HI>Folio,</HI> and the other in <HI>Quarto</HI> to
sell. The Fryar, who was a mungrel also, understood no <HI>Latin;</HI> but
finding them not to be in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language, would have stopp'd
the Books as stoln from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had not the Souldier been too
strong for him. These Books were thought to have been <HI>Boulaye</HI>'s;
who, to my knowledge, had two Chests full, well bound; in reading
whereof he spent the greatest part of his time. His Avarice was his
Ruine; for had he taken a Bark by himself, as I did when I went from
<HI>Patna,</HI> and had oblig'd the Watermen to give him good security, he
could have run no hazard. For my part I took one with four and twenty
men; and every one, knowing I never spar'd for cost, gave me excellent
security. These Barks are little Galliots, which will undertake to carry
you to your journey's end, and name your own day. If you will lye
ashoar every evening, they will set up your Tents; and stop at any
Town or City to take in Provisions. I never made so pleasant a Voy∣age
in my life, nor with less trouble. For in these Barks, there is a
Room where the Sun cannot come in, where you may repose in the day
time, and sit in the cool Air on that side from whence the Breez comes.
There is another place cover'd for your Kitchin; and another little
Garderobe for the private deeds of Nature. By the way I kill'd great
<PB N="50" REF="93"/>
store of large Geese, Cranes, and Crocodiles, which I gave the Water∣men,
who were very glad of them; for they sold them in the Towns
as they row'd along. The people in those quarters are very good natur'd
and officious. Dyet is little worth, as being the place where you may
buy a hundred Pullets for a Crown: and for three or four Pence, you may
buy a Fish of a prodigious length and bigness.</P>
<P><HI>Beber</HI>'s end was no less sad. For when the <HI>French</HI> Companies Ships
were arriv'd, M. <HI>Caron,</HI> who commanded them, and M. <HI>Rambos,</HI> with an
<HI>Armenian,</HI> who had the management of the chiefest part of the business,
had been acquainted with what had pass'd at <HI>Surat,</HI> between <HI>Beber</HI> and
the Capuchins. Presently Affections and Interests parted. <HI>Caron</HI> and
<HI>Rambos</HI> took <HI>Beber</HI>'s part; the <HI>Armenian</HI> held for the Capuchins, which
was at length the ruin of <HI>Beber</HI> and <HI>Rambos.</HI> The <HI>Holland</HI> Commander
going aboard to visit the Sieur <HI>Caron,</HI> upon his return would not permit
the Captain to stir out of his Cabin; so that <HI>Rambos</HI> and the <HI>Armenian</HI>
took upon them to wait upon the Commander. Upon this Occasion
the <HI>Armenian</HI> took upon him to precede <HI>Rambos,</HI> and briskly threw him∣self
before the <HI>French</HI>-man; who being provok'd at the Affront, gave
the <HI>Armenian</HI> a swinging cuff o' the Ear before all the company. To be
short, the Sieur <HI>Caron, Rambos,</HI> and <HI>Beber</HI> holding all together, the <HI>Ar∣menian</HI>
found himself too weak to resist: and in regard he had the
Management of the Cash, he was accus'd of Misbehaviour, and was
condemn'd to be hang'd. But because they could not execute the Sen∣tence
which they had given at <HI>Surat,</HI> they sent him away to the Council
Royal of the Island of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> of which M. <HI>Mondevergue</HI> was chief;
who was so far from confirming the Sentence given at <HI>Surat,</HI> that he
admitted the <HI>Armenian</HI> to justifie himself; and finding that he was not
only innocent, but that he might be very useful to the Company, he
sent him back to <HI>Surat</HI> with more power then he had before. This put
<HI>Beber</HI> and <HI>Rambos</HI> into a fit of Despair, to see the person whom they
thought to have ruin'd, now above them. Thereupon they found a
way to get 12000 <HI>Roupies</HI> a piece for their Wages, which they pretended
to be due from the Company: and with that and 24000 <HI>Roupies</HI> which
<HI>Beber</HI> had of his own they Embarqu'd both together for <HI>Goa.</HI> Where,
being arriv'd, <HI>Beber</HI> dy'd soon after: But as for <HI>Rambos,</HI> he return'd home
again through <HI>Ispahan.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
UPON THE
TRADE
OF THE
EAST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat Nation which has a design to settle a Trade in the
<HI>East-Indies,</HI> must be sure in the first place, to possess
themselves of a convenient place in that Country, to
carine their Ships, and shelter themselves during the
tempestuous Seasons. This want of a good Haven is
the reason that the <HI>English</HI> have not made those advan∣tages
which otherwise they might have done; because
it is impossible that any Vessel should remain in those
Seas without being carin'd, or else eaten by the worms.</P>
<P>Therefore, because it is a long way from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> it
would be requisite to have a retreating place at the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> to
take in fresh Water and Provisions, whether going or coming; but
especially in their return, in regard that the Ships being then laden, can∣not
take in Water for any long time.</P>
<P>The Road of the Island of <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s, where the <HI>English</HI> have built
a Fort, is a very commodious place: and if the Water be not so good
upon the North-side, yet the Plain is an excellent spot of Ground to sow,
with convenience of all things necessary for human support.</P>
<P>This advantage the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have depriv'd all other Nations
of, by their Forts upon the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> and <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s. And there∣fore
some River's mouth, near the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> ought to be sought
for, for the same purpose, which would be far more convenient then
the <HI>Dauphin Island,</HI> where there is no Trade but that of buying Cattel
for their Hides; which being a Trade of so little consequence, would
ruin a Company to follow it.</P>
<P>The reason why I make this Proposal is, because that in the year 1648,
two <HI>Portugal</HI> Vessels being bound from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and
resolving to touch at the <HI>Cape,</HI> to take in fresh Water, mistook their just
Depths, so that the Sea running high, they fell into a Bay, 18 or 20
Leagues from the <HI>Cape,</HI> upon the Coast that looks to the West. In that
<PB N="52" REF="94"/>
Bay they found a River, whose Water was very good; and the Blacks
of the Country brought them Refreshments of all sorts of Fowl, Fish,
and Bullock's flesh. There they staid above 15 days, and before they
set sail, they took two of the <HI>Negro's,</HI> which they carri'd along with
them to <HI>Goa;</HI> to teach them the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Language; on purpose to try
if they could discover by them any knowledge of the Trade of the
Country. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander at <HI>Surat</HI> desir'd me, to inform my
self, when I went to <HI>Goa,</HI> what the <HI>Portugals</HI> had learnt from those two
<HI>Negro's.</HI> But one <HI>St. Amand,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Ingeneer, who was Supervisor
of the Fortifications of <HI>Goa,</HI> told me, That he could not make them learn
one word of the Language; and that he could only guess by their signs,
that they had some knowledge of <HI>Ambergreece</HI> and <HI>Elephants Teeth.</HI>
The <HI>Portugals</HI> however made no question but to meet with Gold, if they
could find a way to trade higher up i' the Country. The Revolutions
of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and their Wars with <HI>Spain</HI> have hinder'd them from making
any more particular discovery of the Coast. Which it were to be wish'd
the <HI>French</HI> would undertake, provided they gave no cause of jealousie to
the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> of what they were going about.</P>
<P>There is also a necessity of possessing, or at least having the liberty
of some place near <HI>Surat,</HI> to ride safe in, and to wash and tallow in, in
case they should be staid by the Rain-Seasons. The reason is, because
that during that ill season, at what time it is impossible to keep the Seas,
the <HI>Mogul</HI> jealous of his Fortress of <HI>Surat</HI> suffers no Foreign Vessel in the
River, where nevertheless, the Ships being unladen, may ride securely
from the terrible Tempests that last for five Months.</P>
<P>The only secure place for the Companies Vessels would be the Town
of <HI>Dia,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>The advantage of the situation is considerable for several reasons.
The circuit of the City contains almost 400 Houses, and might be
capable to receive a greater number of people, where the Ships would
find all conveniencies during their stay. It is seated upon the Coast
of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> upon a point of the Gulph of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> looking toward the
South-east. The form of it is almost round; and above half the Circle
environ'd by the Sea. It is not commanded by any Hill; and the <HI>Por∣tugals</HI>
have begun those Fortifications, which might be easily finish'd.
It contains several Wells of very good Water, and a River which falls
into the Sea near the City, whose Water is better then that of <HI>Surat,</HI> or
<HI>Souali,</HI> and the Harbour is very commodious for Shipping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals,</HI> when they had first settl'd themselves in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
kept there a Fleet compos'd of Galleys, Brigantines, and other light
Vessels, whereby they made themselves Masters, for a long time, of all
the Trade of the Places we have treated of. So that no Ship could
trade, without the Governour of <HI>Dia</HI>'s Passport, who made it in the Name
of the Viceroy that liv'd at <HI>Goa.</HI> The Imposition, which the Ships paid,
was sufficient to maintain the Fleet and Garrison, and to enrich the Go∣vernour
besides.</P>
<P>When the Rain-Seasons are over, that the wind sits at North and
North-east, you may sail from <HI>Dia</HI> to <HI>Surat</HI> in three or four Tides with
light Vessels; but great Ships that are laden must fetch a compass about
the Bank.</P>
<P>The City has no Land belonging to it, but what it stands upon, yet
it would be no difficult thing to agree with the <HI>Raja,</HI> or Govervour of
<PB N="53" REF="94"/>
the Province, and to obtain as much as should be sufficient for the Inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>Neither is the Land about it very fertile, and besides, the people are
the poorest in the whole Empire of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> Nevertheless the Country
is so well stor'd with Cattel, that an Ox or a <HI>Bufalo</HI> will not cost above
two <HI>Piasters.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> make use of these Cattel to feed their
People, and to spare the Provisions of their Ships, while they stay at
<HI>Souali.</HI></P>
<P>But it is observable that the <HI>Bufalo</HI>'s flesh in those parts causes frequent
Dysenteries, which the Bullocks flesh or Beef never does.</P>
<P>The <HI>Raja</HI> that commands the Country has only the Title of Governour
for life. Which is common to most of the <HI>Raja's</HI> in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Em∣pire,
whose Ancestours were Lords of Provinces, where now their
Descendants only enjoy the Titles of Governours.</P>
<P>Having thus got possession of a good Post; the next thing of Impor∣tance
is to choose out two men considerable for their Honesty Prudence,
and Skill in Trade, who are to be allow'd the full of their Expences.</P>
<P>These two persons are to serve the Company, the one in the nature
of a President, with a Council, consisting of a certain number of persons,
to assist him. The other in the quality of a Broaker, who must be an
Idolater of the Country, and not a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> in regard all the Work∣men
he has to deal with are Idolaters.</P>
<P>Civility and Faith of Promise are altogether requisit to gain Credit
among strangers. And these particular qualities are requir'd in the
particular Broakers, who are under the Broaker-General in the Pro∣vinces
where the Factories are settl'd.</P>
<P>Good Intelligence is necessary for these two persons, to understand
the alteration of Manufactures.</P>
<P>This alteration happens either through the craft and subtilty of the
Workmen and the Merchants themselves, or by the correspondence of
the Broakers and Workmen.</P>
<P>Which alteration may cause so much dammage to the Company, that
the Broakers shall gain ten and twelve i' the hundred by it.</P>
<P>If the President and Broaker-General combine with the particular
Broakers and Merchants, it will be a difficult thing for the Company to
avoid being deceiv'd; but if these two persons are but faithful and honest,
the fraud may be easily remedi'd by changing the particular Broakers.</P>
<P>The Officers of a Company may be unfaithful to their Trust in this
respect:</P>
<P>When a Vessel arrives in Port, the President for the Nation receives
the Company's Letters, and the Bills of Lading; upon which he calls
his Council, sends for the Broaker, and gives him a Copy of the said
Bills.</P>
<P>The Broaker shews them to three or four of the principal Merchants
of the Country, who are wont to buy by whole sale. If the President
and the Broaker hold together for their own profit, the Broaker instead
of facilitating the sale as he ought to do, advises the Merchants to be
shie, and to offer only such a price: Then the President sends for the
Broaker and these two or three Merchants; and in the presence of the
Council he asks the Merchants what they will give for the Goods in
the Bills of Lading mention'd. If the Merchants are resolute to give
<PB N="54" REF="95"/>
no more then so much; The President puts off the sale 15 days longer,
more or less, as he pretends himself press'd to sell. In the mean time
he sends for the Merchants several times for a shew, and at length, to
avoid suspicion, and to discharge himself, he asks the advice of the
Council, and as they approve, orders the delivery of the Goods to the
Merchant.</P>
<P>But though the Temptations be very great, to which these two Offi∣cers
are subject, by reason of their pow'r, their frequent opportunities,
and their distance from their Superiours, the Company, besides their
being wary in their Election, may remedy these disorders by depriving
them of that pretence, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commanders and Broakers
have, of being constrain'd to sell off presently to the Merchants in gross,
to avoid the expences of delay.</P>
<P>The Errour which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> commit in this respect is, That their
Officers bespeak every year upon Credit all the Goods which they have
occasion for in the Empire of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> according to the Orders which
they receive from <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The credit of this Advance costs them sometimes twelve, sometimes
fifteen <HI>per Cent;</HI> so that so soon as their laden Vessels are arriv'd in the
the Port where they are to be sold, they are oblig'd to sell them presently
off at the Merchants rate first offer'd to their Broakers, to make up a
present stock to pay off their credit for the Goods bespoke for their Ships
to carry back again, and to get more credit for the next year. This is
that which cherishes that confederacy between the President, the Broaker
and the Merchant, who makes advantage enough of this necessity of
selling.</P>
<P>Whereas the better way were, for them that carry the same Commo∣dities
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do, to carry Money also to pay the Work∣men
for the Goods bespoken for the next year.</P>
<P>The Company making this advantage shall not be put to pay that
great Interest of 12 and 15 <HI>per Cent.:</HI> and besides, they shall have better
Goods, and better cheap. The Ships loading shall be ready before they
arrive in Port; and being quick laden they may return before the bad
Season. Neither shall the Company be put to sell their Goods at a low
price; because their Broakers will have time to stay for the coming of
Merchants from other parts; or else because they have time enough to
send them to other places, where they are sure of a quicker sale.</P>
<P>Observe also, That it is far more profitable to carry to the <HI>Indies</HI> Gold
and Silver in Ingots, rather then ready coin'd; for being coin'd the
Money is valu'd only according to their Alloys; and there is always a
defalcation made for the charge of Coinage.</P>
<P>The Broaker also, if he be dishonest, may combine with the Master
of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Mint, which is settl'd in several parts of the Empire, and
put a lower value upon the Gold and Silver then it deserves, by telling
the President and Council, that upon the touch it appears to be no more
worth.</P>
<P>But it is an easie thing to avoid this deceit, provided the President be
a person of credit and prudence, by sending for one of the Refiners of
Gold and Silver, that live in the Country, who perfectly understand the
Touch of Metals, and to let him Essay the Gold and Silver before the
Broaker's face.</P>
<P>This is that which the Sieur <HI>Walkenton</HI> did for the <HI>Holland</HI> Company
<PB N="55" REF="95"/>
in their Factory at <HI>Casambazar,</HI> where he bought every year six or seven
thousand Bales of Silk. For by this Essay he found, that his Broaker
being in confederacy with the Master of the Mint, had cheated the
Company of one and a half and two <HI>per Cent.</HI> in the value of the Gold
and Silver which was brought him from <HI>Japan,</HI> as well coin'd as in barr,
to a very considerable sum of Money.</P>
<P>The Broaker also may confederate with the Master of the Mint to
couzen the Merchant in weghing his Gold or Silver, by making use of
false Weights or Scales unduly pois'd.</P>
<P>But that fraud is easily avoided, if the President and his Council will
be but so patient as to see their Metal weigh'd themselves, and take care
that the Weights be right, and the Scales true.</P>
<P>One of the most important Observations in reference to the Trade of
the Company, and discipline of their Factories is this:</P>
<P>To prevent the Merchants or under-Merchants, Accomptants and
under-Accomptants, who officiate under the Commanders and Broakers,
from driving any particular Trade by themselves, for they having a
familiarity with the men of Manufacture, and finding by the Letters of
Advice what Goods are likely to be most vendible next year, buy them up
upon their own accompts, and find a way to lade them off in the Com∣pany's
Vessels, to the great dammage of the whole, though to the great
gain of particular people.</P>
<P>And this the President permits them to do, either for his own In∣terest,
or by connivance under the pretence of their small Wages. The
Captain of the Vessel also winks at what they do, because he has a spell
for loading and unloading. And because these people having no great
Stocks, are desirous to put off their Goods with the first opportunities,
they give order to their Correspondents to under-sell the Company ten
or twelve in the Hundred, which is the absolute ruin of a Trade.</P>
<P>To remedy this disorder there ought to be a Fiscal, or King's Proctor,
in every of the chief Factories belonging to the Company, to act in the
King's Name, and by his Authority.</P>
<P>He is to be independent from the President and the Broaker, in the
Exercise of his Office; so that he may have an eye, as well upon their
behaviour, as upon the demeanour of the under Officers.</P>
<P>He ought to be a person of good Credit, resolute and vigilant; and
he must have a strength of men correspondent to his Employment, and
a Deputy to act under him.</P>
<P>He is to have good Information of the departure of all Ships when
they are once laden, and when they are ready to set sail for the Port
whither they are bound. When he hears of the Arrival of any Ship,
he ought to go himself, or send his Deputy with a sufficient Guard, to
take an Accompt of the Ship's Lading.</P>
<P>If it be a place near to which there are any small Islands, or by-Nooks, it
behoves him to take care that no Goods be privately convey'd ashoar
in those private corners, where there are receivers a now ready: and
whatever he finds thus privately unladen he shall have power to con∣fiscate.</P>
<P>He shall also confiscate whatever he finds not Mark'd with the Com∣pany's
Mark.</P>
<P>He may also discharge any inferiour Officers to whom any such Bales
<PB N="56" REF="96"/>
shall belong; and for the superiour Officers, he shall complain of them to
the Company.</P>
<P>He shall have pow'r to open all private Letters, to inform himself of
Prohibited Goods, and Private Correspondencies.</P>
<P>This Prohibition of Private Trading cannot be too severely impos'd,
and it is observ'd with so much exactness in <HI>Holland,</HI> that when one of
the Company's Ships is ready to set sail from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a Burgomaster
gives the Captain and all the rest of the Seamen their Oaths, that they
shall be contented with their Wages, and meddle with nothing of
Trade.</P>
<P>All the Officers of the Factory should be advanc'd by degrees, so that a
sub-Accomptant may have hopes to be a President; that the hopes of Ad∣vancement
may oblige them to live with more credit, and cause them to
study to make themselves more capable of all the Intrigues and Subtilties
of the Trade of the Country.</P>
<P>It is of great importance not to shew any favour in this particular of
preferment, unless he have pass'd through all particular Degrees and
Offices beforehand. And thus much concerning the Discipline of the
Factories.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE
COMMODITIES
WHICH ARE
Brought as well out of the Dominions of the GREAT MOGUL,
as out of the Kingdoms of Golconda and Visapour, and other
neighbouring Territories; And also of the Weights and Prices
of the said Commodities.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Silk.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">K</SEG>Asembasar,</HI> a Village in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> sends
abroad every year two and twenty-thousand Bales of
Silk; every Bale weighing a hunder'd pound. The
two and twenty Bales make two millions and two-hunder'd-thousand
pound, at sixteen ounces to the
pound. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> usually carry away six or
seven-thousand Bales, and would carry away more,
did not the Merchants of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s
Empire oppose them: for they buy up as much as the <HI>Hollander;</HI> the rest
the Natives keep to make their Stuffs. This Silk is also brought into
the Kingdom of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> the greatest part whereof comes to <HI>Amadabat,</HI>
and to <HI>Surat,</HI> where it is wrought up.</P>
<P>In the first place they make Carpets of Silk and Gold, others of Silk
and Silver, others all of Silk: for the Worsted Carpets are made at
<HI>Vettapour,</HI> some twelve leagues from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>In the second place they make Satins with streaks of Gold and Silver;
others plain: with Taffata's after the same fashion.</P>
<P>In the third place they make <HI>Patoles,</HI> which are a sort of Silk-stuff
very thin, but painted with all sorts of Flowers, the manufacture
whereof is at <HI>Amadabat.</HI> They cost from eight <HI>Roupies</HI> to forty the piece.
This is a Commodity wherein the <HI>Dutch</HI> will not suffer any one of the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> to trade in particular: for they transport it to the <HI>Philippine-Islands,</HI>
to the Islands of <HI>Borneo, Java, Sumatra,</HI> and other neighbouring
Islands.</P>
<P>The raw-Silk of <HI>Kasembasar</HI> is yellowish, as are all the raw-Silks that
come from <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Sicily;</HI> but the Natives of <HI>Kasembasar</HI> have a way
to whiten it, with a Lye made of the ashes of a Tree which they call
<HI>Adam</HI>'s Fig-tree; which makes it as white as the <HI>Palestine</HI>-Silk. The
<HI>Hollanders</HI> send away all their Merchandize which they fetch out of <HI>Ben∣gala,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="97"/>
by water, through a great Canal that runs from <HI>Kasembasar</HI> into
<HI>Ganges,</HI> for fifteen leagues together; from whence it is as far by water
down the <HI>Ganges</HI> to <HI>Ouguely,</HI> where they lade their Ships.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Calicuts: and first of the painted Calicuts, call'd <HI>Chites.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>CHites</HI> or Painted Calicuts, which they call <HI>Calmendar,</HI> that is to say,
done with a Pencil, are made in the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda;</HI> and
particularly about <HI>Maslipatan.</HI> But there is made so little, that though
a man should employ all the Workmen that understand the Art of
weaving Calicuts, he would hardly find enough to make three Bales.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chites</HI> which are made in the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> are all
printed; and nothing so beautiful, neither for the figures nor the fine∣ness
of the Linnen. Those which are made at <HI>Lahor,</HI> are the coarsest,
and consequently the cheapest of all. They are sold by <HI>Corges,</HI> every
<HI>Corge</HI> consisting of twenty pieces, which cost from 16 to 30 <HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chites</HI> which are made at <HI>Seronge,</HI> are sold from 20 to 50 <HI>Roupies</HI>
the <HI>Corge,</HI> or thereabouts.</P>
<P>These <HI>Chites</HI> serve for Coverlets for Beds, for Sofra's or Table-cloaths
after the Country-fashion, Pillowbears, Handkerchiefs, but more espe∣cially
for Wastcoats as well for the men as women in <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The fine Calicut-<HI>Chites</HI> are made at <HI>Brampour;</HI> and are us'd for Hand∣kerchiefs
by those that snuff Tobacco.</P>
<P>The women also, over all <HI>Asia,</HI> make Veils of these Calicuts, to wear
over their heads, and about their shoulders, which Veils are call'd <HI>Ormis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Basta's</HI> or Calicuts painted red, blue, and black, are carri'd white to
<HI>Agra,</HI> and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> in regard those Cities are nearest to the places
where the <HI>Indigo</HI> is made that is us'd in colouring. They cost from two
<HI>Roupies</HI> to 30 or 40 a-piece, according to the fineness and the quantity of
Gold at the ends, and sometimes upon the sides. The <HI>Indians</HI> have a
way to dip some of these Calicuts in a certain water that makes them
look like Water'd-Chamlets, which adds also to the price.</P>
<P>That sort which is sold for two <HI>Roupies,</HI> and so onward till ye come to
twelve, is transported to the Coast of <HI>Melinda,</HI> and it is the greatest
Trade the Governour of <HI>Mosambique</HI> drives, who sells them to the <HI>Cafres,</HI>
that vend them again among the <HI>Abyssins,</HI> and into the Kingdom of <HI>Saba:</HI>
for those people not understanding the use of Soap, need no more but
only to wash these Calicuts in water. That sort which is valu'd from
12 <HI>Roupies</HI> upward, is transported to the <HI>Philippine</HI>-Islands, the Islands
of <HI>Borneo, Java, Sumatra,</HI> and other adjacent places. Where the women
wear no other clothes, then a single piece of this Calicut. One part
whereof, without cutting it, serves for a Petticoat; the other they
wind about their stomachs and their heads.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>White Calicuts.</HEAD>
<P>VVHite Calicuts come partly from <HI>Agra,</HI> and about <HI>Lahor,</HI> part
from <HI>Bengala:</HI> some from <HI>Brouda, Baroche, Renonsari,</HI> and other
places. They are brought out of the Loom to <HI>Renonsari,</HI> and <HI>Baroche,</HI>
where they are whiten'd by reason of the convenience of their Meadows,
and the great store of Limons that grow thereabouts. For the Calicuts
are never so white as they should be, till they are dipt in Limon-water.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="97"/>
The Calicuts that come from <HI>Agra, Lahor,</HI> and <HI>Bengala,</HI> are sold by the
<HI>Corge,</HI> and they are of several prices, from seventeen <HI>Roupies</HI> to three or
four-hunder'd, as the Merchant will have them wov'n.</P>
<P>The Calicuts that come from <HI>Renonsari,</HI> and <HI>Baroche,</HI> are one and twenty
cubits long, new out of the Loom; but in the whitening they shrink to
twenty cubits.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Brouda</HI> twenty cubits from the Loom, and shrink in the
whitening to nineteen and a half.</P>
<P>All the Calicuts or <HI>Bafta's</HI> that come from these three Cities, are of two
sorts: for some are broad, some are narrow. The narrow are those I have
already mention'd, the prices whereof are various, from two <HI>Mamoudi's</HI>
to six.</P>
<P>The broad <HI>Bafta</HI>'s are a cubit, and one third part wide; the whole
piece twenty cubits long. The usual price of them is from five <HI>Mamoudi's</HI>
to twelve: but a Merchant being upon the place, may cause them to be
made much more large and fine, till they are worth five-hundred <HI>Ma∣moudi's</HI>
a-piece. I saw two pieces sold for a thousand <HI>Mamoudi's.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> brought one, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> another, each Piece contain∣ing
eight and twenty cubits.</P>
<P><HI>Mahamed Alibeg</HI> returning into <HI>Persia</HI> out of <HI>India,</HI> where he had been
Embassador, presented <HI>Cha-Sef</HI> the second with a Coco-nut, about the
bigness of an Austrich-egg, all beset with Pearls: and when 'twas open'd
there was taken out of it a Turbant that had sixty cubits of Calicut in
length to make it, the Cloath being so fine, that you could hardly feel it
in your hand: For they will spin their thread so fine, that the eye can
hardly discern it, or at least it seems to be but a Cob-web.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Twisted-Cotton.</HEAD>
<P>COtton twisted and untwisted comes from the Provinces of <HI>Brampour</HI>
and <HI>Guzerat.</HI> Untwisted Cotton is never transported into <HI>Europe,</HI>
being too cumbersome, and of little value; only they send it to <HI>Ormus,
Balsara,</HI> and sometimes to the <HI>Philippine</HI>-Islands, and the Islands of <HI>Sinde.</HI>
As for the twisted Cottons, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> transport a good
quantity, not of the finest, but of that sort which is pric'd from fifteen to
fifty <HI>Mamoudi's:</HI> It serves for wicks for Candles, for Packsaddles, and for
the ground of Silk-stuffs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Indigo.</HEAD>
<P><HI>INdigo</HI> comes from several parts of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Empire; and
according to the diversity of the places it differs in quality, and con∣sequently
in price.</P>
<P>In the first place, it comes from the Territories of <HI>Biana, Indoua,</HI> and
<HI>Corsa</HI> a day or two's journey from <HI>Agra:</HI> which is esteem'd the best of all.
It is made also eight days journey from <HI>Surat,</HI> in a Village called <HI>Sarquess,</HI>
two leagues distance from <HI>Amadabat.</HI> Here the flat <HI>Indigo</HI> is made. There
is also <HI>Indigo</HI> little inferior in goodness and price, which comes from the
King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Territories. The <HI>Mein</HI> of <HI>Surat,</HI> which contains
42 <HI>Serre's,</HI> or 34 and a half of our pounds, is valu'd from 15 to 20
<HI>Roupies.</HI> They make as good as this at <HI>Baroche.</HI> That which is made up
about <HI>Agra</HI> is made up in half Balls, and is the most sought for in all <HI>India.</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="98"/>
It is sold by the <HI>Mein,</HI> which in those places contains 60 <HI>Serres,</HI> or 51 and
three quarters of our pounds. The usual price is from 36 to 40 <HI>Roupies.</HI>
There grows also <HI>Indigo</HI> some 36 leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> about a great
Village call'd <HI>Raout,</HI> and round about the neighbouring Towns in the
road to <HI>Surat:</HI> Of which the Natives usually make above a hunder'd-thousand
<HI>Roupies.</HI></P>
<P>There comes <HI>Indigo</HI> also from <HI>Bengala,</HI> which the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company
transports for <HI>Maslipatan.</HI> But they buy this <HI>Indigo,</HI> and that of <HI>Brampour</HI>
and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> cheaper by 24 in the hunder'd, then that of <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indigo</HI> is made of an Herb which they sow every year after the rains are
over: which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it
three times a year; first when it is about two or three foot high; and
they cut it within half a foot of the ground; the first cutting far exceeds
the two latter. The second cutting is worse then the first by ten or
twelve in the hunder'd. And the third worse then the second by 12 in the
hunder'd. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Paste, and
observing the colour. The colour of that <HI>Indigo</HI> which is made of the first
cutting, is a Violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others:
and that which is made of the second is more lively then the third.</P>
<P>When they have cut the Herb, they throw it into Pits which they
make with Lime, which becomes so hard, that you would judg it to be
one intire piece of Marble. They are generally fourscore or a hunder'd
paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quite up
with the Herb. Then they bruise and jumble it in the water till the leaf,
for the stalk is worth nothing, becomes like a kind of thick mud. This
being done, they let it settle for some days; and when the setling is all at
the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When
the water is all drain'd out, they fill several baskets with this slime, and
in a plain Field you shall see several men at work, every one at his own
basket, making up little pieces of <HI>Indigo</HI> flat at the bottom, at the top
sharp like an egg. Though at <HI>Amadabat</HI> they make their pieces quite flat
like a small cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Mer∣chants,
because they would not pay custom for an unnecessary weight,
before they transport their <HI>Indigo</HI> out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> are very careful
to cause it to be sifted, to separate the dust from it; which they sell
afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They
that sift this <HI>Indigo</HI> must be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath before their
faces, and that their nostrils be well-stopt, leaving only two little holes
for their eyes. Besides, they must every half hour be sure to drink milk,
which is a great preservative against the piercing quality of the dust.
Yet notwithstanding all this caution, they that have sifted <HI>Indigo</HI> for
nine or ten days, shall spit nothing but blew for a good while toge∣ther.
Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the sisters, and when I
came to break it in the evening it was all blew within.</P>
<P>As they take the Paste out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in
Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes, they lay them in the Sun to dry.
Which is the reason that when the Merchants buy <HI>Indigo,</HI> they burn
some pieces of it, to try whether there be any dust among it. For the
Natives who take the Paste out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps,
lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Paste, and fouls it. But when
the Merchants burn it, the <HI>Indigo</HI> turns to Ashes, and the Sand remains.
The Governours do what they can to make the Natives leave their
<PB N="61" REF="98"/>
Knavery; but notwithstanding all their care, there will be some
deceit.</P>

<HEAD>Salt-Peter.</HEAD>
<P>GReat store of <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> comes from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Patna;</HI> but the refin'd
costs three times more then that which is not. The <HI>Hollanders</HI>
have set up a Ware-House fourteen Leagues above <HI>Patna,</HI> and when their
<HI>Salt-Peter</HI> is refin'd, they transport it by water by <HI>Ogueli.</HI> A Mein of
refin'd <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> is worth seven Mamoudi's.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Spice.</HEAD>
<P>CArdamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves
and Cinnamon, are all the different sorts of Spices known to us.
I put Cardamom and Ginger in the first place, because that Cardamom
grows in the Territories of <HI>Visapour,</HI> and Ginger in the Dominions of
the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI> And as for other Spices, they are brought from other
Foreign parts to <HI>Surat,</HI> which is the grand Mart.</P>
<P>Cardamom is the most excellent of all other Spices, but it is very
scarce; and in regard there is no great store in the place where it grows,
it is only made use of in <HI>Asia,</HI> at the Tables of great Princes. Five
hundred pound of Cardamoms, are pric'd from a hundred to a hundred
and ten Rials.</P>
<P>Ginger is brought in great quantities from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> where there
grows more than in any other part of <HI>Asia;</HI> and it is hardly to be imagin'd
how much there is transported candited into Foreign parts.</P>
<P>Pepper is of two sorts. There is a sort which is very small, another
sort much bigger; both which sorts are distinguish'd into small and great
Pepper. The larger sort comes from the Coast of <HI>Malavare;</HI> and <HI>Tuti∣corin</HI>
and <HI>Calicut</HI> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this
Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of <HI>Visapour,</HI> being vended
at <HI>Rajapour,</HI> a little City in that Kingdom. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that purchase
it of the <HI>Malavares,</HI> do not give Money for it, but several sorts of Commo∣dities
in Exchange; as Cotten, Opium, Vermilion, and Quicksilver; and
this is the Pepper which is brought into <HI>Europe.</HI> As for the little Pepper
that comes from <HI>Bantam, Afchen,</HI> and some other parts towards the East,
there is none of it carried out of <HI>Asia,</HI> where it is spent in vast quantities,
especially among the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> For there are double the Grains of
small Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper; besides
that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth.</P>
<P>The little Pepper that comes to <HI>Surat,</HI> has been sold some years for
thirteen or fourteen Mamoudi's the Mein; and so much I have seen the
<HI>English</HI> give for it, to transport it to <HI>Ormus, Balsara,</HI> and the Red Sea.
As for the great Pepper, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fetch from the Coast of
<HI>Malavare,</HI> five hundred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty∣eight
Reals; but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they
gain <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow'r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the
only Spices which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in their own hands. The three first
come from the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands; the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from
the Island of <HI>Ceylan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="99"/>
'Tis observable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never
planted, which has been confirm'd to me by several persons that have
liv'd several years in the Country. They related to me, that the Nut∣meg
being ripe, several Birds come from the Islands toward the South,
and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be
digested. The Nutmeg then besmear'd with a viscous matter, falling
to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never
thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one observation
upon the Birds of Paradise. These Birds being very greedy after Nut∣megs,
come in flights to gorge themselves with the pleasing Spice, at the
season, like Felfares in Vintage time; but the strength of the Nutmeg
so intoxicates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the
Emets in a short time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds
of Paradise are said to have no Feet; which is not true however, for
I have seen three or four that had Feet; and a <HI>French</HI> Merchant sent
one from <HI>Aleppo</HI> as a Present to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth that had Feet; of
which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Projects, you may buy Cloves at
<HI>Macassar</HI> without purchasing them of the <HI>Hollander;</HI> in regard the Islan∣ders
buy them of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains and Soldiers, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
have in those places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange
Rice, and other necessaries for the support of life, without which they
would starve, being very sadly provided for.</P>
<P>When the Natives of <HI>Macassar</HI> are thus furnish'd of Cloves, they barter
them in Exchange for such Commodities as are brought them; some∣times
they give Tortoise-Shells in exchange, and Gold Dust; by which
the Merchant gains six or seven in the hundred, being better than the
Money of the Island, though it be Gold, by reason the King oft∣times
enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are
<HI>Amboyna, Ellias, Seram,</HI> and <HI>Bouro.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands of <HI>Banda</HI> also, in number six, <HI>viz. Nero, Lontour, Poulcay,
Roseguin,</HI> and <HI>Grenapuis,</HI> bear Nutmegs in great abundance. The Island
of <HI>Grenapuis</HI> is about six Leagues in compass, and ends in a sharp point,
where there is a continual fire burning out of the earth. The Island
<HI>Damme,</HI> where there grows great store of Nutmegs, and very big, was
discover'd in the year 1647, by <HI>Abel Tasman,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander.</P>
<P>The Price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them sold to the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Surat,</HI> was as follows.</P>
<P>The Mein of <HI>Surat</HI> contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of
our Pounds, at sixteen Ounces to the Pound.</P>
<P>A Mein of Cloves was sold for a hundred and three Mamoudi's and
a half.</P>
<P>A Mein of Mace was sold for a hundred and fifty-seven Mamoudi's and
a half.</P>
<P>Nutmegs for fifty-six Mamoudi's and a half.</P>
<P>Cinnamon comes at present from the Island of <HI>Ceylan.</HI> The Tree
that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They
never take off but the first and second, which is accounted the best. They
never meddle with the third, for should the Knife enter that, the Tree
would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they
learn from their youth. The Cinnamon Spice is much dearer to the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> then people think; for the King of <HI>Ceylan,</HI> otherwise call'd
<PB N="63" REF="99"/>
King of <HI>Candy,</HI> from the name of his principal City, being a sworn
Enemy to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> sends his Forces with an intention to surprize
them, when they gather their Cinnamon; so that they are forc'd to
bring seven or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that
are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the
price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a
certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the <HI>Portugals</HI>
were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of
the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water was all consum'd. When it
was cold, the upper part became a Paste like white Wax; of which they
made Tapers to set up in their Churches, for no sooner were the Tapers
lighted, but all the Church was perfum'd. Formerly the <HI>Portugals</HI>
brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the <HI>Raja's</HI> about
<HI>Cochin.</HI> But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have destroy'd all those places, so that the
Cinnamon is now in their hands. When the <HI>Portugals</HI> had that Coast,
the <HI>English</HI> bought their Cinnamon of them, and usually paid for it by the
Mein fifty Mamoudi's.</P>

Gum-Lake for the most part comes from <HI>Pegu;</HI> yet there is some also
brought from <HI>Bengala,</HI> where it is very dear, by reason the Natives
fetch that lively Scarlet colour out of it, with which they paint their
Calicuts. Nevertheless, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy it, and carry it into <HI>Persia</HI>
for the same use of painting. That which remains after the colour is
drawn off, is only fit to make sealing Wax. That which comes from
<HI>Pegu</HI> is not so dear, though as good for other Countries. The difference
is only this, that it is not so clean in <HI>Pegu,</HI> where the Pismires foul it, as
in <HI>Bengala,</HI> where it grows in a heathy place, full of Shrubs, where
those Animals cannot so well come at it. The Inhabitants of <HI>Pegu</HI> never
make any use of it in painting, being a dull sort of people, that are in
nothing at all industrious.</P>
<P>The Women of <HI>Surat</HI> get their livings by cleansing the Lake after the
Scarlet colour is drawn from it. After that they give it what colour
they please, and make it up into Sticks for sealing Wax. The <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Holland</HI> Company carry away every year a hundred and fifty Chests.
The price is about ten Pence the pound.</P>
<P>Powder'd Sugar is brought in great quantities out of the Kingdom of
<HI>Bengala;</HI> it causes also a very great Trade at <HI>Ougeli, Patna, Daca,</HI> and
other places. I have been told it for a very great certainty, by several
ancient people in <HI>Bengala,</HI> that Sugar being kept thirty years becomes
absolute poison, and that there is no Venom more dangerous, or that
sooner works its effect. Loaf-Sugar is also made at <HI>Amadabat,</HI> where
they are perfectly skill'd in refining it; for which reason it is call'd Sugar
Royal. These Sugar-Loaves usually weigh from eight to ten pound.</P>
<P>Opium is brought from <HI>Brampour,</HI> a Town of good Trade between
<HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Surat.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy great quantities, which they truck
for their Pepper.</P>
<P>Tobacco also grows in abundance round about <HI>Brampour;</HI> sometimes
there has been so much that the Natives have let vast quantities rot upon
the ground, for want of gathering.</P>
<P>Coffee grows neither in <HI>Persia</HI> nor in <HI>India,</HI> where it is in no request;
but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> drive a great Trade in it, transporting it from <HI>Ormus</HI>
into <HI>Persia,</HI> as far as Great <HI>Tartary,</HI> from <HI>Balsara</HI> into <HI>Chaldea, Arabia,
Mesopotamia,</HI> and the other Provinces of <HI>Turky.</HI> It was first found out
by a Hermite, whose name was <HI>Sheck-Siadeli,</HI> about twenty years ago,
before which time it was never heard of in any Author either ancient or
modern.</P>

<HEAD>Deceits in Silk Wares.</HEAD>
<P>PLain Silk Wares may be alter'd in length, breadth, and quality. The
quality shews it self when they are of an even thread, when the
weight is equal, and when there is no Cotton thread in the Weft.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> not having the art of gilding silver, put into their strip'd
Wares threads of pure Gold, so that you must count the quantity of Gold
threads to see whether the Silk have its due number. And this also you
must observe in your Silks wov'n with Silver. As for Taffata's, you are
only to mind whether the pieces be all of a fineness, and to see by
unfolding some of them, that there be nothing within to augment the
weight, and then weighing all the pieces by themselves, to see that they
all agree.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="100"/>
The colours of those Carpets which are made in <HI>India,</HI> do not last so
long as the colour of those which are made in <HI>Persia;</HI> but for the work∣manship
it is very lovely. The eye of the Broaker is to judge of the large∣ness,
beauty, and fineness of those Carpets which are wrought with Gold
and Silver, and whether they be fine and rich. But whether they be
Carpets, or other Stuffs mix'd with Gold and Silver, it behoves the
Buyer to pull out some of the Gold and Silver Threads, to see whether
they be of the right value or no.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Deceits in the White Calicuts.</HEAD>
<P>THe deceits usually put upon Calicuts, are in fineness, length, and
breadth. Every Bale may contain two hundred pieces; among
which they will juggle in five or six or ten, less fine, or less white, shorter
or narrower than according to the scantling of the Bale, which cannot
be found out but by examining them piece by piece. The fineness is
discern'd by the eye, the length and breadth by the measure. But the
<HI>Indians</HI> practise a more cunning way, which is to count the number of
threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the fineness of
the scantling. When the number fails, it is either more transparent,
more narrow, or more course. The difference is sometimes so difficult
to be perceiv'd, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the
threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great
deal. For it is nothing to cousen a Crown or two Crowns in a piece
that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Those that whiten these
Calicuts, to save charges of a few Limons, will knock the Calicuts
excessively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury, and
lowers the price.</P>
<P>As for their Calicuts dy'd blew or black, you must take care that the
Workmen do not knock them after they are folded, to make them look
sleek; for many times when they come to be unfolded, you shall find
holes in the creases.</P>
<P>As for your painted and printed Calicuts, which are painted and
printed as they come out of the Loom, the Merchant must take care that
what he bespeaks be finish'd before the end of the Rains, for the thicker
the Water is where they are wash'd, the more lively will the printed and
painted colours appear. It is easie to distinguish between the printed
and the painted Calicuts; and between the neatness of the work: but
for the fineness and other qualities, they are not so easily discern'd; and
therefore the Broaker must be more careful.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Cheats in Cotton.</HEAD>
<P>THe cheat in the weight is twofold. The first, by laying them in
a moist place; and thrusting in the middle of every Skain some∣thing
to add to the weight. The second, in not giving good weight
when the Broaker receives it from the Workman, or Merchant that
delivers it.</P>
<P>There is but one cheat in the quality, that is by putting three or four
Skains, of a coarser Commodity then that which is uppermost, into
one <HI>Mein.</HI> Which in a great quantity mounts high; for there are some
Cottons that are worth an hunder'd Crowns the <HI>Mein.</HI> These two cheats
<PB N="66" REF="101"/>
being often us'd by the <HI>Holland</HI>-Company, there is no way but to weigh
your Commodity in the presence of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Commander, and his
Councel, and to examin every <HI>Mein</HI> Skain by Skain. When this is
done, they who are order'd to be at his examination, are oblig'd to fix
to every Bale a ticket of the weight and quality: for if there be a faileur,
they who fix the ticket are engag'd to make good what is wanting.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Deceits in Indigo.</HEAD>
<P>I Have told you, that when the Work-men have made up the Indigo-Paste
into lumps, with their fingers dipt in Oil, they lay them in
the Sun a drying. Now those that have a design to cheat the Merchants,
dry them in the sand, to the end that the sand sticking to the Indigo,
should encrease the weight. Sometimes they lay up their Paste in moist
places, which makes it give, and consequently renders it more heavy.
But if the Governour of the place discovers the cheat, he makes them
severely pay for it: and the best way of discovery is to burn some pieces
of Indigo, for the sand will remain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Indian Broakers.</HEAD>
<P>THe Broakers are as it were the Masters of the <HI>Indian</HI> Families; for
they have all Goods at their disposal. The Work-men choose the
most aged and most experienc'd, who are to endeavour equal advantages
for the whole Tribe they undertake for. Every evening that they return
from their business, and that; according to the custom of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
who make no Suppers, they have eaten some little piece of sweet-meat,
and drank a glass of water, the eldest of the Tribe meet at the Broaker's
House, who gives them an account of what he has done that day, and
then they consult what he is to do next. Above all things, they caution
him to look to his hits, and to cheat, rather then be cheated.</P>
