<HEAD>A FULL AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF A TOTAL VICTORY OVER THE TURKS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE CORONATION OF THE KING OF POLAND</HEAD>
<P><LABEL>WHITEHAL, September 26. 1697.</LABEL> LAST Night arrived here one of His Majesty's Messengers from <HI>Holland,</HI> being sent over with the TREATY of PEACE betwixt His Majesty &amp; the Most Christian King, in order to its Ratification; which being dispatched under the Great Seal, was sent back this Evening. <HI>Hague, October</HI> 1. N. S. On the 22. of the last Month, the Embassadors of the Allies met again with the <HI>French</HI> Embassadors at <HI>Ryswick,</HI> where a Cessation of Arms was agreed on between the Emperor and <HI>France,</HI> till the first of <HI>November.

To this end they made several P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>osals, and offered to come over to his side, in case he would defer the Sole<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty till after he had called a General Diet, where Matters might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttled wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utual Consent and Agreement.

<P><LABEL>Vienna September 18.</LABEL> On the 14. instant Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Vandemont</HI> arrived here from the Imperial Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> to bring the Emperor the good News of
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/> an entire and glorious Victory they have obtained over the Turks with these par∣ticulars. The Turkish Army having passed the River <HI>Theysse,</HI> under the Com∣mand of the Grand Visier, and posted themselves between the Imperial Army and <HI>Peter-Warradin,</HI> by which means they endeavoured to cutt off our Communication with the <HI>Danube:</HI> Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who commanded in Chief the Empe∣rours Forces, resolved so soon as General <HI>Rabutin</HI> with the Troops from <HI>Transil∣vania</HI> had joyned them, to march towards the Enemy, and attack them in their Camp; This was put in execution on the 11. instant, and with more diligence because he was informed by some Prisoners, that the Turks to avoid a Battle, were going to repass the <HI>Theysse:</HI> After several Hours march, the Imperialists came up with the Enemy; whom they found posted near <HI>Senta,</HI> being 25000 Janizaries and 6000 Horses, having secured their Camp with a triple Entrenchment, and a Bridge behind them. The Grand Seignior lay encamped with the rest of his Army on the other side of the River: Our Troops with great Bravery attacked the first Entrenchment, which they made themselves Masters of in an Hours time; the Turks retiring within their second Entrenchment, where they made a great Re∣sistance but were likeways beaten from that, and from the third, and fled in great Confusion; but being stoped by the narrowness of the Bridge, and the croud that endeavoured to pass it, a great Slaughter was made by several peices of Can∣non, which played upon them. Of the Enemy there were found Killed upon the place about 12000, besides those that were drowned, the number of which was likeways great, the Grand Visier, Aga of the Janisaries, &amp; several Bassa's are among the Slain: We took all their Baggage, Wagons &amp; Tents, 72 Peices of Cannon, great quantity of Amunition, &amp; a great many Horse. The Grand Seignior seeing this De∣feat of his Forces, abandoned his Camp on the other side of <HI>Theysse,</HI> and retired with great precipitation towards <HI>Temeswaer:</HI> The Imperial Horse and Hussars pur∣sued the Enemy, killed a great Number, and took all their heavy Artilery, Tents, Treasure and Baggage, which they left in their <HI>Second</HI> Camp▪ and it'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are not above 900 or 1000 killed.
