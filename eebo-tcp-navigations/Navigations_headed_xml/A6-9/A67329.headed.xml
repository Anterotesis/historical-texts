<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The several Names by which</HI> Orkney <HI>is call'd. The Longitude and Latitude of this Country An account of a Stone generated in the Air. How this Coun∣try is bounded. Some odd Phaenomena about the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. The number of the Islands; and a short Account of each of them, with their different Harbours. The chief Products of this Country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Country in our English Language is call'd <HI>Orkney;</HI> by the Latins, both Ancient and Modern, it is call'd <HI>Orcades. Pomponius Mela</HI> writes it with an aspi∣ration, <HI>Orchades.</HI> What reason there is for the Name is not condescended up∣on, but it's probable the Latin Name may be from <HI>Orcas,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> makes to be a Promontory of <HI>Cathnes</HI> over-against this Country, or from some
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
Colony of the <HI>Picts,</HI> who first Planted this Country, and from some Similitude with the Name whereby they call'd themselves, might be so call'd by the <HI>Romans.</HI> As for the English name <HI>Ork∣ney,</HI> it may be derived from some Pictish Prince, as <HI>Erick</HI> or <HI>Orkenwald,</HI> or some other who has been famous in the first Plantation; or might have got the name from some remarkable Title which the first Planters the <HI>Pights</HI> took to them∣selves; for <HI>Picts</HI> or <HI>Pights</HI> (as <HI>Verstegan</HI> says) in the Teutonick Tongue signifies Fighters; and <HI>Orkney</HI> may come from <HI>Ear,</HI> which signifies Honour, and <HI>Kyn,</HI> which signifies on Off-spring, as if the name were intended to shew, That they were an Off-spring or Generation of Honour.</P>
<P>This Country lies in the Northern temperate Zone and thirteenth Cli∣mate; the Longitude being 22 De∣grees and 11 Minutes, and Latitude 59 Degrees and 2 Minutes, the Compass varying eight Degrees; so that the length of the longest Day is eighteen Hours and some odd Minutes; yet not∣withstanding that this Country is so far remov'd to the North, the Air is tem∣perate and wholsome, agreeing well
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
with those Constitutions that can en∣dure a little Cold. At Midnight it is so clear for a great part of <HI>June,</HI> that one may read a Letter in his Chamber; yet it cannot be true what <HI>Bleau</HI> reports, That from the Hill of <HI>Hoy</HI> a Man may see the Sun at Midnight; for it cannot be the true Body of the Sun that is seen, but the Image of it refracted through some watry Cloud about the Horizon, seeing it must be as far depressed un∣der our Horizon in <HI>June,</HI> as it is elevated above it in <HI>December,</HI> which is by many Degrees; for from that Hill the Sun is to be seen in the shortest Day in <HI>December</HI> above five Hours.</P>
<P>The Air and Clouds here, by the o∣peration of the Sun, do sometimes gene∣rate several things; as some Years since, some Fishermen Fishing half a League from Land, over-against <HI>Copinsha,</HI> in a fair Day, there fell down from the Air a Stone about the bigness of a Foot-ball, which fell in the middle of the Boat and sprung a Leake, to the great dan∣ger of the Lives of the Men that were in it, which could be no other than some Substance generated in the Clouds. The Stone was like condensed or pe∣trefied
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
Clay, and was a long time in the custody of Captain <HI>Andrew Dick,</HI> at that time Steward of this Country; and Cap∣tain <HI>Dick,</HI> who is yet alive, told me he gave it to the late Earl of <HI>Glencairn.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Winters are generally more subject to Rain than Snow; nor does the Frost and Snow continue so long here as in other parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Wind in the mean time will often blow very boisterously, and it Rains sometimes not by drops but by spouts of Water, as if whole Clouds fell down at once. In the Year 1680, in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> after great Thun∣der, there fell flakes of Ice near a foot thick.</P>
<P>This Country is wholly surrounded with the Sea, having <HI>Pightland-Firth</HI> on the South, the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Oce∣an on the West, the Sea that divides it from <HI>Zetland</HI> on the North, and the German Sea on the East. <HI>Zetland</HI> stands North-East and by East from <HI>Orkney,</HI> and from the Start of <HI>Sanda</HI> in <HI>Orkney</HI> to <HI>Swinburg</HI> Head the most Southerly Point in <HI>Zetland</HI> is about eighteen leagues, where there is nothing but Sea all the
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
way, save <HI>Fair Isle,</HI> which lies with∣in eight Leagues of <HI>Swinburg-Head.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> which divides this Country from <HI>Cathnes,</HI> is in breadth from <HI>Duncansbay</HI> in <HI>Cathnes</HI> to the near∣est point of <HI>South-Ronalsha</HI> in <HI>Orkney</HI> about twelve Miles, in it are a great many different Tides, reckon'd to the number of twenty four, which run with such an impetuous force, that a Ship under sail is no more able to make way against the Tide, than if it were hinder'd by a <HI>Remora,</HI> which I con∣ceive is the reason why some have said they have found the <HI>Remora</HI> in these Seas.</P>
<P>In this Firth, about two Miles from the Coast of <HI>Cathnes,</HI> lies <HI>Stroma,</HI> a lit∣tle pleasant Island, but because of its vicinity to <HI>Cathnes,</HI> and its being still under the Jurisdiction of the Lords of that Country, it is not counted as one of the Isles of <HI>Orkney.</HI> On the North-side of this Isle is a part of <HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> call'd the <HI>Swelchie</HI> of <HI>Stroma,</HI> and at the West-end of the Isle, betwixt it and <HI>Mey</HI> in <HI>Cathnes,</HI> there is another part of the Firth, call'd the <HI>Merry Men of Mey,</HI> both which are very dangerous to Sea∣men.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
The Sea ebbs and flows here as in other places, yet there are some Phae∣nomena, the reason of which cannot so easily be found out; as in the Isle of <HI>Sanda,</HI> it flows two hours sooner on the West-side than it does on the East∣side; and in North <HI>Faira</HI> (which lies betwixt <HI>Eda</HI> and <HI>Westra)</HI> the Sea ebbs nine hours and flows but three: And at <HI>Hammoness</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> both ebb and flood run one way, except at the be ginning of a quick Stream, when for two or three hours the flood runs South.</P>
<P>The Sea here is very turbulent in a Storm, and uneasie even to those on Land, especially in those places of the Country that lie expos'd to <HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> and the Western Ocean, for when the Storm beats that way, the Sea da∣shes with such violence against the Rocks, that a great deal of the Sea is carry'd (in some places near a quarter of a mile) on the Land, and falls like a great shower of Rain on the Ground, which is very oft prejudicial to their Corn at certain Seasons.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
The Tides also are very swift and violent, by reason of the multitude of the Isles and narrowness of the Passage; for, when all the rest of the Sea is smooth, these Tides carry their Waves and bil∣lows high, and run with such violence that they cause a contrary motion in the Sea adjoyning to the Land, which they call <HI>Easter-birth</HI> or <HI>Wester-birth,</HI> according to its course; yet notwithstanding of the great rapidity of these Tides and Births, the Inhabitants, daily almost, travel from Isle to Isle about their se∣veral affairs in their little Cockboats or Yoals, as they call them.</P>
<P>Whatever the Ancients have written of the number of the Islands of <HI>Orkney,</HI> it's certain there are but twenty six, at present inhabited, <HI>viz. South-Ronalsha, Swinna, Hoy</HI> and <HI>Waes, Burra, Lamb∣holm, Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gramsey, Po∣mona</HI> or <HI>Mainland, Copinsha, Shapinsha, Damsey, Inhallo, Stronsa, Papa-Stronsa, Sanda, North-Ronalsha, Eda, Rousa, Wyre, Gairsa, Eglesha, North-Faira, Westra, Papa-Westra.</HI> The rest of the Islands are call'd <HI>Holms,</HI> and are only used for Pasture; all of them being separated from one another by some narrow
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
Streights. Most of these Islands names end in <HI>a</HI> or <HI>ey,</HI> which in the Teutonick signifieth Water, to shew that these Isles are pieces of Land surrounded with Water.</P>
<P>These Islands are of different Natures, some Sandy, some Marsh, some aboun∣ding in Heath and Moss, and some that have none, some of them Mountainous and some Plain. Of these some are call'd the South-Isles, and others the North-Isles, and that as they stand to the South or North of the greatest Island, call'd the <HI>Mainland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>South-Ronalsha</HI> is the Southermost of these Islands, five Miles long, fertile in Corn, and abounding with People. To the South-East lie the <HI>Pightland Sker∣ries,</HI> dangerous to Seamen; but to the North is St. <HI>Margarets Hope,</HI> a very safe Harbour for Ships, which has no diffi∣culty in coming to it, save a Rock in the middle of the Sound, betwixt this Island and <HI>Burra,</HI> call'd <HI>Lippa.</HI> From <HI>Burwick,</HI> in this Isle, is the usual Ferry to <HI>Duncansbay</HI> in <HI>Cathnes.</HI></P>
<P>A little separated from this, to the South-West, lies <HI>Swinna,</HI> a little Isle, and only considerable for a part of <HI>Pight</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<HI>land-Firth</HI> lying a little to the West of it, call'd the Wells of <HI>Swinna,</HI> which are two Whirlpools in the Sea (occa∣sion'd, as is thought, by some <HI>Hin∣tus</HI> that is in the Earth below) that run about with such violence, that if any Boat or Ship come within their reach they will whirl it about and about till it be swallow'd up and drown'd. They are only dangerous in a great Calm; for if there be any Wind, and the Boat under Sail, there is no danger to go over them. If a Boat happen to come near them in a Calm, by the force of the Tide driving that way, the Boats-men, for their preservation throw a Barrel or an Oar, or any bulky thing that comes next to hand, into the Wells, and when it is swallow'd up the Sea remains smooth for a time for any Boat to pass over.</P>
<P>Beyond this, and to the West of <HI>South-Ronalsha,</HI> lies <HI>Waes</HI> and <HI>Hoy</HI> (thought to be the <HI>Dumna</HI> of <HI>Pliny)</HI> which are but one Isle, about twelve Miles in length, full of high Mountains, and but thinly inhabited, unless in <HI>Waes,</HI> where the Ground is very pleasant and fertile. From <HI>Snelsetter</HI> in <HI>Waes</HI> is the
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
other Ferry from this Country to <HI>Ham,</HI> in <HI>Cathnes.</HI> Here are several good Har∣bours, as <HI>Kirk-hope, North-hope, Ore∣hope,</HI> and others, but not now much frequented, tho' <HI>North-hope</HI> be one of the best Harbours in this Country, if not in the whole World, and most pro∣per for those that design a Fishing Trade.</P>
<P>To the North of <HI>South-Ronalsha</HI> lies <HI>Burra,</HI> a pleasant little Isle, fruitful in Corns and abounding in Rabbits. Be∣twixt <HI>Burra</HI> and the <HI>Mainland</HI> is <HI>Lamb∣holm,</HI> and to the West, towards <HI>Hoy∣mouth,</HI> lies <HI>Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gram∣sey,</HI> all of them fruitful and pleasant I∣slands, tho' they be not large.</P>
<P>Next to these is the <HI>Mainland,</HI> call'd by the Ancients <HI>Pomona</HI> or <HI>Pomonia,</HI> about twenty four Miles in length, and well inhabited. About the middle of this Island, to the North, stands <HI>Kirk∣wall,</HI> the only Town in all this Coun∣try. There are in the <HI>Mainland</HI> four excellent Harbours for Ships, one at <HI>Kirk∣wall,</HI> both large and safe, without any danger by Shoals or blind Rocks as they come to it, unless they come from the West by <HI>Inhallo</HI> and <HI>Gairsa:</HI> A∣nother
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
Harbour is at <HI>Deirsound,</HI> which is a great Bay, and a very safe Road for Ships, having good anchoring ground, and capable of sheltering the greatest Navies. The third is at <HI>Grahamshall,</HI> toward the East-side of this Isle, where there is a convenient Road; but the Ship that sails to it from the East, would do well to keep betwixt <HI>Lamb∣holm</HI> and the <HI>Mainland,</HI> for the other way betwixt <HI>Lambholm</HI> and <HI>Burra</HI> (which appears to them to be only open) is very shallow and dangerous, even for small Ships. The fourth is at <HI>Kair∣ston,</HI> a small Village, at the West end of the <HI>Mainland,</HI> where there is a ve∣ry safe and commodious Harbour, well fenc'd against all Winds by two small <HI>Holms</HI> that stand at the entry.</P>
<P>To the East of the <HI>Mainland</HI> lies <HI>Copinsha,</HI> a little Isle, but very conspi∣cuous to Seamen, as is that <HI>Holm</HI> to the North-East of it, call'd the Horse of <HI>Copinsha.</HI></P>
<P>To the North of the <HI>Mainland,</HI> lie the North-Isles, the first of which is <HI>Shapinsha,</HI> about five or six Miles in length, and hath a very safe Harbour for Ships at <HI>Elwick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
Of an equal bigness to that toward the South-East lies <HI>Stronsa,</HI> where there is two very good Harbours; one at <HI>Lingasound,</HI> fenc'd with <HI>Lingaholm,</HI> the other at <HI>Strynie,</HI> fenc'd with a little pleasant Isle to the North of it, call'd <HI>Pa∣pa-Stronsa.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond these, toward the North, at some distance, lies <HI>Sanda,</HI> about twelve Miles long, but very narrow, well in∣habited; it hath two Roads for Ships, one at <HI>Kitletoft,</HI> guarded by a little Holm, call'd the Holm of <HI>Elsnes,</HI> the o∣ther at <HI>Otterswick,</HI> guarded by the most Northern-Island in all this Country, call'd <HI>North-Ronalsha,</HI> which is a little fruitful Isle, but both it and <HI>San∣da</HI> have no Moss Ground, but are ob∣liged to bring their Peits and Turfs (which is the only Fuel they have thorough this whole Country) a great way off, from the next adjacent Island, <HI>Eda.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Eda</HI> lyeth to the South-East of <HI>Sanda,</HI> thought to be the <HI>Ocetis</HI> of <HI>Pto∣lemy,</HI> near five Miles in length, full of Moss and Hills, but thinly inhabited, unless it be about the skirts of it; it
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
has a safe Road to the North, call'd <HI>Calf-sound.</HI></P>
<P>Three Miles to the West of <HI>Kirk∣wall,</HI> at the bottom of a large Bay, lies a little Island, call'd <HI>Damsey,</HI> with a Holm near it as large as it self.</P>
<P>To the North North-West lies <HI>Rou∣sa,</HI> about six Miles long, but very hil∣ly and ill inhabited. Betwixt it and the <HI>Mainland</HI> lies <HI>Inhallo,</HI> and towards <HI>Kirkwall</HI> lies <HI>Wyre</HI> and <HI>Gairsa,</HI> small but profitable Islands.</P>
<P>North from <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> at eight Miles distance, is <HI>Eglesha,</HI> near three Miles in length, very pleasant and fertile, having a safe Road for Ships betwixt it and <HI>Wyre.</HI> In this Isle there is a little hand∣some Church, where, it is said, that Saint <HI>Magnus,</HI> the Patron of this Country, lies Bury'd.</P>
<P>To the North of <HI>Eglesha</HI> is <HI>Westra,</HI> seven Miles long, pleasant, fertile and well inhabited. There is in it a conve∣nient Harbour for Ships, at <HI>Piriwa.</HI> At the East of it lies <HI>Faira,</HI> call'd for di∣stinction, <HI>Faira by North;</HI> and to the North and by East, is <HI>Papa-Westra,</HI> a pleasant Isle, three Miles in length, fa∣mous in this Country for Saint <HI>Fredwell</HI>'s
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Chapel and Lake, of which many ridi∣culous things are reported by the Vul∣gar.</P>
<P>All these Islands are indifferently fruit∣ful, well stor'd with Fields of Corn and Herds of Cattle, and abound with Rab∣bits, and the greatest plenty of Muir∣fowl and Plover that there is any where, but have no Hares or Partridges.</P>
<P>The chief products of this Country, and which are Exported yearly by the Merchant, are, Butter, Tallow, Hides, Barley, Malt, Oatmeal, Fish, Salted Beef, Pork, Rabbit-skins, Otter-skins, white Salt, Stuffs, Stockings, Wool, Hams, Writing-Pens, Downs, Feathers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I Did not find this Country so well stor'd with Plants as I expected; as for instance, I found none of the <HI>Malva</HI> kind, nor several other Plants that I thought might have agreed well enough with this Country; but such as I did find, I thought an ac∣count of them might not be unaccep∣table, tho' I am far from pretending this to be so very exact as it should have been; these being the Names of those only I have by me.</P>

<P>There are no Trees any where in all this Country, except some few Ashes Thorn and Plumb Trees that are in the Bishops Garden in <HI>Kirkwal.</HI> There are in some Gentlemens Gardens in <HI>Kirk∣wal,</HI> and several other places of the Country, some Apple and Cherry-trees, but they seldom bear Fruit that comes to any maturity; and the Trees grow never higher than the Garden Walls. And, except some few wild Roses and Juniper that I see in <HI>Hoy,</HI> and the <HI>Myr∣tillus</HI> and Heath, which is common eve∣ry where, I don't remember to have seen any Bush or Shrub growing wild
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
in all the Country. Yet in a great ma∣ny Gardens they have several very good Plants both for Use and Ornament; <HI>Cabbage, Turnip, Carrot, Parsnip, Skir∣ret</HI> or <HI>Crummocks,</HI> &amp;c. grow to as great a bigness here as any where; and <HI>Ar∣tichokes</HI> to a greater than ever I have seen them in any other place.</P>
<P>I do not understand the reason why Trees don't grow here, since in the same Latitude in <HI>Norway,</HI> and some de∣grees more Northerly, Trees thrive ve∣ry well, even on small Rocks surroun∣ded by the Sea. I know not whether it be in places where the Sea makes such a breach as it does in some places of this Country, where the Sea-water, with the violence of the Storm, is carry'd a great way on the Land, and blasts all it falls on: This, with the violent Winds that oft blow in this Country, I think, may be one reason why Trees don't prosper so well; but if they have the same Breaches in <HI>Norway,</HI> I don't know what to say to it. Whether Trees have grown here of old; or, what is more probable, if it be the remains yet of the Flood, but commonly, in their Mos∣ses,
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>
they find Trees of twenty or thirty Foot long.</P>
<P>After Storms of Westerly Wind, a∣mongst the Sea-weed, they find com∣monly in places expos'd to the Western-Ocean these <HI>Phaseoli,</HI> that, I know not for what reason, go under the Name of <HI>Molucca</HI> Beans. The in∣genious <HI>Doctor Sloan</HI> in the <HI>Philosophi∣cal Transactions,</HI> Number 222, gives a very satisfactory Account, how from the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where they commonly grow, they may be thrown in on <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> the Western parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Orkney.</HI> You have the Figures of four different sorts of them.</P>
<P>Here is good store of Sheep and Cows, which tho' they be little, yet yield abundance of Milk. Their Ewes are so fertile, that most of them have two at a Birth, some three. I my self saw one that had four all living and following the Dam.</P>
<P>Their Horses are but little, yet strong, and can endure a great deal of Fatigue, most of which they have from <HI>Zet∣land</HI> and are call'd <HI>Shelties.</HI> There are great Herds of Swine and rich War∣rens almost in every Isle, well stor'd
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>
with Rabbits. Frogs are seen but sel∣dom, yet there are some Toads, tho', as it is thought, they are not poisonous, as indeed there are few, if any, poiso∣nous Animals in all this Country.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Ottars</HI> and <HI>Seols</HI> are to be had every where, and oft times <HI>Spout Whales</HI> and <HI>Pellacks</HI> run in great number up∣on the shore and are taken, as in the Year 1691, near <HI>Kairston</HI> in the <HI>Main∣land,</HI> there run in a Bay no less than a hundred and fourteen at once.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stellae-marinae</HI> and <HI>Urtica-Marina</HI> are oft thrown in great plenty. In the Sea they catch Ling, Keeling, Haddock, Whiting, Mackrel, Turbat, Scate, Con∣gre-Eels, Sole, Fleuks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and some∣times they catch Sturgeon.</P>
<P>In the Year 1682, in Winter, there was taken a strange but beautifull Fish in <HI>Sanda</HI> (where several of them had been taken before) it was about an Ell in length, deep Breasted, and narrow at the Tail; the Head and Finns, and a stroke down the Back were all of a deep scarlet colour, which made it beau∣tiful to look on; the rest was of a brown∣ish colour, without scales, having se∣veral whitish spots in the Body; the
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>
Fish of the half next the Head was like Beef, and of the other half next the Tail was like Salmon.</P>
<P>Herring swim thorough these Islands in great plenty, but the People are not so frugal, or have not the way, to catch them. Some Years ago, many Ships from <HI>Fife</HI> frequented this Country for the catching of Herrings; but the Sea∣men having been in the Year 1645, at the Battle of <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> they were there almost all Killed; since which time that Trade failed; tho' the Hollanders, to our eternal Reproach, fail not to keep it up to their great advantage.</P>
<P>Sometimes strange Fishes are cast a shore, to which the People give as strange Names. I see one like a Goose Feather, the Body being like the Quill, and the Tail like the Feather, of a red∣dish colour. This seems to be what <HI>Gesner</HI> calls, <HI>Penna Marina Sitardi.</HI> As for that strange sleeping Fish that <HI>Boe∣thius</HI> mentions in his Description of this Country, I could never hear of it.</P>
<P>I have oft observ'd in the Head of the grayish Snail, those bright white Stones <HI>Doctor Lister</HI> mentions in his excellent Book, <HI>De Cochleis &amp; Araneis Angliae,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
The People here beat them to Powder, and reckon it a Specifick for the Gra∣vel.</P>
<P>As to their Land Shells, I cannot so well describe, since, after I understood any thing of that part of Natural Hi∣story, the very short time I staid there gave me but little opportunity to make so nice an enquiry as I should other∣wise have done; only I observ'd a great variety of the <HI>Cochleae Terrestres,</HI> both as to their <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Fasciae,</HI> and that <HI>buccinum rupium,</HI> &amp;c. which Dr. <HI>Lister</HI> describes <HI>Tit.</HI> 8. <HI>De Cochleis Terrestribus.</HI> Since there are no Rivers, there can no River-shells be expected here; but in their small Rivolets the <HI>buccinum exi∣guum trium spirarum à sinistra in dextram convolutarum</HI> was common: And of the Sea-shells I found the</P>

<P>I could name a great many more of these kind of <HI>Pectines,</HI> that are by some reckon'd distinct species, but I think them all of the same kind, and that they have these accidental Colours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from their being sometime expos'd to the weather, since I could never see any live shells have such Colours or be so variegated: And tho' they were I doubt if it be altogether warrantable in
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
this part of natural History, to distin∣guish Shells only differing in some acci∣dental Colours, more than it would be to reckon black and red Hair'd, those of a large or smaller Stature, different Species or Tribes of men.</P>
<P>I observ'd in <HI>Stroma</HI> a little Island that lies in <HI>Pightland Firth,</HI> and in some places in <HI>Orkney,</HI> where there went ex∣traordinary cross and strong Tides, al∣most all the thinner sort of <HI>Pe∣ctines,</HI> so twisted and of such an irre∣gular shape, that I was surpris'd to see it. I cannot think the odd strange tum∣bling the Tides make there, can contri∣bute any thing to that frame; yet after all I never see them so in any other place. See the Figure of one of them.</P>

<P>On a Log of wood which has been some time in the Sea, and afterwards thrown upon the shore by some Storm, I have seen thousands of the <HI>Balani Ron∣deletij,</HI> or the <HI>Concha Anatifera;</HI> and on the Rocks every where the</P>
<Q>Balanus cinereus, velut è senis laminis striatis compositus, ipso vertice, altera testa bisida rhomboide occluso.</Q>

There is such abundance almost every where of Shell-fish, but especially Cockles, that the whole Country is serv'd no other way with Lime, but by those Shells burn'd, which makes a very fair Lime, and does very well in Plaister, though I doubt whether it be so proper for Building as stone Lime is.</P>
<P>As to the Crustaceous Fishes, as <HI>Lobsters, Crabs,</HI> &amp;c. they are in as great abundance here, as any where.</P>
<P>Here is plenty of tame and wild Fowl; they reckon they have 8 or 9 different sorts of wild Geese, and of gray <HI>Plover, Moorfowl, Wild-Duck, Swans, Teal, Whaps,</HI> or <HI>Curlew,</HI> &amp;c. there is no place better stor'd. They have likewise many <HI>Foists</HI> and <HI>Lyers</HI> both Sea Fowls very fat and delicious. Sometime the <HI>Stock-Owl</HI> and <HI>Bittern</HI> have been seen in this Country. Eagle and Earns as they call them, and Gledes or Kites are here in great plenty, and very hurtful to their young Store: Yea, they have been found to seize upon young Chil∣dren and carry them a good way of; and there is yet a Man alive, one <HI>John Hay,</HI> living now in <HI>Sanda,</HI> who was thus
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
carried away by an Eagle, while a young Child in swadling cloaths (his Mother having left him on the Grass, till she went a little way to carry somewhat) to her Nest; but was so speedily by the blessing of God preven∣ted that no harm was done to him. There is a Law in this Country, that if any kill any of these <HI>Earns</HI> or <HI>Ea∣gles,</HI> he is to have a Hen out of every house in the Parish in which it is killed.</P>
<P><HI>Hawks</HI> and <HI>Falcons</HI> have their Nests in several places of these Islands; as in the <HI>Noup, Swendal,</HI> and <HI>Rapnes</HI> in <HI>We∣stra;</HI> at <HI>Highberry</HI> and <HI>Aith-head</HI> in <HI>Waes;</HI> at <HI>Braebrake, Furcarsdale</HI> and <HI>Rathwick</HI> in <HI>Hoy;</HI> at <HI>Halcro, Greehead</HI> and <HI>Hocksa</HI> in <HI>South-Ronalsha;</HI> at <HI>Bellibrake</HI> and <HI>Quen∣dal</HI> in <HI>Rousa;</HI> at <HI>Rousumhead</HI> and <HI>Lamb∣head</HI> in <HI>Stronsa,</HI> in the calf of <HI>Eda;</HI> at <HI>Gatnip, Gultack, Mulehead,</HI> in <HI>Dierness, Copinsha, Blackcraig</HI> of <HI>Stromnes, Yeskrabie, Birsa, Marwick</HI> and <HI>Costahead</HI> in the <HI>Main∣land.</HI> The King's Falconer comes eve∣ry Year, and takes the young, who has Twenty Pound Sterling in Salary, and a Hen or Dog out of every House in
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>
the Country, except some places that are Privileg'd.</P>
<P>There are several Mines of Tinn, Lead, and perhaps of other Metals, e∣specially in the <HI>Mainland, South-Ronalsha, Hoy, Stronsa, Sanda,</HI> but are neglected, or not improved, through Poverty or Carelessness. A great deal of Marle is found, especially in the <HI>Mainland,</HI> of which the Husbandman makes good use for mannor. In many places are Quarries of excellent free or sand Stone and Slate. Not far from <HI>Birsa</HI> at <HI>Buck∣quoy</HI> and <HI>Swinna</HI> are to be found some Veins of Marble and Alabaster.</P>
<P>On the shore, sometimes, is to be found <HI>Sperma Ceti, Ambergreese, Water∣sponges,</HI> and a great many Cuttle-bones, or <HI>Os Sepiae.</HI> Sometimes they catch Exo∣tick Fowls, driven in by the Wind in time of a Storm; as one some time ago that had along Beak, a large tuft on the Head, in fashion of a Crown, with speckled Feathers, very pleasant to see, which, I believe, was the <HI>Upupa;</HI> and two or three Years ago, in <HI>Sanda;</HI> there was a very beautiful Bird driven in there alive; they afterwards shot it, and I had it sent me; 'twas something like
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>
a Woodpecker, but of extraordinary lively Colours, especially a light Blue and a Green. And I have seen the <HI>Al∣bardeola,</HI> or <HI>Shovelaer,</HI> driven in there.</P>
<P>Some Years since, the Day being ex∣ceeding Stormy, there were found be∣fore a Gentleman's Door in <HI>Kirkwal,</HI> some little distance from the Sea, seven or eight <HI>Quiths</HI> (a Fish something less than a Whiting) half alive, as if they had been but newly taken; it's like the violent Wind, they swimming on the top of the Water, had heav'd them out of the Sea, and when the strength of the blast was gone, they had fall'n on that place.</P>
<P>But how violently the Wind blows here, and how great is the force of the Sea breach, may appear from this, That at <HI>Cantick-head</HI> and <HI>Osnua-head</HI> in <HI>Waes,</HI> there are, by the violence of the Sea and Winds, large Stones thrown up from the bottom, a great way above the Rock, some so large, That some Men can hard∣ly move them.</P>
<P>This Country being divided in to small Islands, it cannot be expected there should be in it any Rivers, yet there is every where a great many Rivulets or
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
Bourns, as they call them, well reple∣nish'd with Trouts, both small and great, some of them like to young Sal∣mon.</P>
<P>There is a large Loch or Lake in the <HI>Mainland,</HI> call'd the Loch of <HI>Stennis,</HI> but unfruitful. Besides that, there are in every Island some small Lochs, but they serve for no other use but to af∣ford Water to their Mills and Cattle. There be also some Lochs that have some remarkable properties, as Saint <HI>Tredwell</HI>'s Loch, in <HI>Papa-Westra,</HI> which, they say, is Medicinal; but for what I know not: There is another Loch in <HI>Shapinsha,</HI> of which, it is said, that if any wash their feet in it, they will strike out in Blisters. The Loch of <HI>Swanna,</HI> in the <HI>Mainland,</HI> will have, in some parts, a thick scum, of a Copper Colour, upon it, which makes some think there is some Mine under it.</P>
<P>This Country is most commodious for Navigation, there being every where excellent Bays and Ports for Shipping, the most remarkable of which I have gi∣ven an account of in the last Chapter.</P>

An Ac∣count of the Finn-men that are some∣times driven in there.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is in <HI>Hoy,</HI> lying betwixt two Hills, a Stone, call'd the <HI>Dwarfie-Stone,</HI> which is one entire Stone, thirty six Foot long, eighteen Foot broad, nine Foot thick; hallow'd within by the Hand of some Mason (for the prints of the Irons are to be seen on it to this day) with a square hole of about two Foot high for the entry, and a Stone proportionable standing before it for a Door. Within, at one end, is a Bed ex∣cellently cut out of the Stone, with a Pillow, wherein two Men may lie to∣gether at their full length; at the other
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
end is a Couch, and in the middle a Hearth for a Fire, with a round hole cut out above for the Chimney. It stands in a desolate melancholy place, more than a Mile from any inhabited House, and all the Ground about it no∣thing but high Heath and Heather. It's thought to have been the residence of some melancholy Hermit. See the Fi∣gure of it.</P>
<P>At the West-end of this Stone stands on exceeding high Mountain, of a steep ascent, call'd the <HI>Wart Hill</HI> of <HI>Hoy;</HI> near the top of which, in the Month of <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> about Mid∣day, is seen something that shines and sparkles admirably, and which is often seen a great way off. It hath shined more brightly before than it does now, tho' many have climbed up the Hill, and attempted to search for it, yet they could find nothing. The Vulgar talk of it as some enchanted Carbuncle; but I take it rather to be some Water sliding down the face of a smooth Rock, which when the Sun at such a time shines upon, the reflection causeth that admirable splendor.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="35"/>
At <HI>Stennis,</HI> in the <HI>Mainland,</HI> where the Loch is narrowest, in the middle, having a Causey of Stones over it for a Bridge, there is, at the South-end of the Bridge, a Round set about with high smooth Stones or Flags, about twenty Foot high above ground, six Foot broad, and each a Foot or two thick. Betwixt that Round and the Bridge are two Stones standing of that same largeness with the rest, whereof one hath a round hole in the midst of it; and at the o∣ther end of the Bridge, about half a Mile removed from it, is a large Round about an hundred and ten paces in Dia∣meter, set about with such Stones as the former, but that some of them are fall'n down; and at both East and West of this bigger Round, are two artificial (as is thought) green Mounts; both these Rounds are ditched about. See the Figure of it.</P>
<P>Some think that these Rounds have been places whereon two opposite Ar∣mies have encamped; but I think it more probable that they have been the high places in the <HI>Pagan</HI> times, where∣on Sacrifice was offered, and that these two Mounts were the places where the
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>
Ashes of the Sacrifice was flung. And this is the more probable, because <HI>Boe∣thius,</HI> in the Life of <HI>Mainus,</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> makes mention of that kind of high Stones, calling them the Temples of the Gods. His words are these. <Q>In Memory of what King <HI>Mainus</HI> ordai∣ned anent the worship of the Gods, there remains yet, in our days, many huge Stones drawn together in form of a Circle, named by the People the Ancient Temples of the Gods; and it is no small admiration to consider by what Art or Strength so many huge Stones have been brought together.</Q> So far <HI>Boethius.</HI></P>
<P>There are besides in many other pla∣ces of this Country, <HI>Obelisks,</HI> or great high Stones, set in the Ground like the former, and standing apart (and indeed they are so very large that none sees them, but wonders by what Engine they have been erected) which are thought to be set up either as a memo∣rial of some famous Battle, or as a mo∣nument of some remarkable Person that has been buried there; that way of ho∣nouring deserving and valiant Men, be∣ing
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
the invention of King <HI>Rentha,</HI> as <HI>Boe∣thius</HI> says.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Rousay,</HI> betwixt high Mountains, a place, call'd the Camp of <HI>Jupiter Fring.</HI> The name is strange and would import some notable acci∣dent; but what it was I could not learn.</P>
<P>At the West-end of the <HI>Mainland,</HI> near <HI>Skeal,</HI> on the top of high Rocks, more than a quarter of a Mile in length, there is something like a Street all set in red Clay, with a sort of reddish Stones of several figures and magni∣tudes; having the Images and Repre∣sentations of several things, as it were, engraven on them; and, which is very strange, a great many of these Stones, when they are raised up, have that same Image engraven under, which they have above. This Causey is all a∣long the tops of Rocks, and though they be otherwise of a very conside∣rable heighth above the Sea, yet the West Ocean in a Storm leading that way, does dashwith such violence against the Rocks, that the Sea breaches do wash the Ground on the tops of the Rocks. If these Stones had not the same Figure on that side next the ground
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>
that they have above, I should think the Sea washing over them might occasion these different figures, by washing a∣way the softish parts of the Stone and leaving the harder, and so accordingly give them these accidental Shapes and Figures. Tho' there are a great many of them still remaining, yet the Gen∣tlemen living near that place have ta∣ken away those that had the prettiest Figures to set their Chimnies with, as they use to do in <HI>Holland</HI> with painted Bricks and Tiles.</P>
<P>In the Links of <HI>Skeal,</HI> where the Sand is blown away with the Wind, are found several places built square, with Stones well cemented together, and a Stone lying in the mouth, having some black Earth in them. The like of which also are found in the Links of <HI>Rousum</HI> in <HI>Stronsa;</HI> where also, some Years ago, was sound another remarkable Monu∣ment. It was a whole round Stone like a Barrel, hollow within, sharp edged at the top, having the bottom joyn'd like the bottom of a Barrel; on the mouth was a round Stone conform to the mouth of the Monument, and a∣bove that a large Stone for the preser∣vation
<PB N="57" REF="37"/>
of the whole; within was nothing but red Clay and burn'd Bones. See the Fi∣gure. It's like that this and the other Four-square Monuments have been some of these Urns wherein the Romans, when they were in this Country, laid up the Ashes of their dead. Likewise in the Links of <HI>Tranabie,</HI> in <HI>Westra,</HI> have been found Graves in the Sand, in one of which was seen a Man lying with his Sword on the one Hand, and a Danish Axe on the other; and others that have had Dogs, and Combs and Knives bu∣ry'd with them, which seems to shew the way how the <HI>Danes,</HI> when they were in this Country, bury'd their dead, as the other was of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Be∣sides in many places of the Country are found little Hillocks, which may be supposed to be the <HI>Sepulchres</HI> of the ancient <HI>Pights.</HI> For <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells that it was the way of the ancient <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> and <HI>Verstegan</HI> that it was the way of the ancient <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Sax∣ons,</HI> to lay dead Bodies on the ground, and cover them over with turss and clods of earth, in the fashion of little Hillocks: hence it seems that the many Houses and Villages in this Country,
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
which are call'd by the name of <HI>Brogh,</HI> and which all of them are built up∣on, or beside some such rising ground, have been cemeteries for the burying of the dead in the time of the <HI>Pights</HI> and <HI>Saxons:</HI> For the word <HI>Brogh</HI> in the Teutonick Language, signifies a burying place.</P>
<P>In one of these hillocks near the circle of high Stones, at the North end of the Bridge of <HI>Stennis,</HI> there were found nine <HI>Fibulae</HI> of Silver of the shape of a Horse-shooe, but round. See the Figure of one of them.</P>
<P>Moreover in many places of this Country, are to be seen the ruins and vestiges of great but antique Buildings; most of them now covered over with Earth, and call'd in this Country <HI>Pights</HI> Houses, some of which its like have been the Forts and Residences of the <HI>Pights</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> when they possess'd this Country.</P>
<P>Among the rest there is one in the Isle of <HI>Wyre,</HI> called the Castle of <HI>Cubbe∣row,</HI> or rather <HI>Coppi-row,</HI> which in the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Language, signifies a Tower of Security from outward violence. It is Trenched about, of it nothing now
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>
remains but the first Floor. It is a perfect Square, the Wall eight foot thick, strongly built and cemented with Lime, the breadth or length within Walls not being above ten foot, having a large Door and a slit for the Window. Of this <HI>Cubbirow</HI> the Common people report many Idle Fables, not fit to be inserted here.</P>
<P>In the Parish of <HI>Hara</HI> in the <HI>Main∣land,</HI> in a Marle-pit as they were dig∣ging Marle for mannor to their ground, there was found in the Marle a large piece of a Harts horn, as I was credi∣bly inform'd by a Gentleman who got the Horn from these men, and had it then by him.</P>
<P>In the Parish of <HI>Evie</HI> near the Sea are some small hillocks, which frequent∣ly in the night time appear all in a Fire, and the Church of <HI>Evie</HI> called St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> is oft seen full of Light, as if Torches or Candles were burn∣ing in it all night. This amazes the people greatly, but possibly it's no∣thing else but some thick glutinous Meteor, that receives that Light in the night time.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="39"/>
At the <HI>Noup-head</HI> in <HI>Westra</HI> is a Rock surrounded with the Sea, call'd <HI>Less,</HI> which the inhabitants of that Isle say, has this strange property; that if a Man go upon it, having any Iron upon him, the Sea will instantly swell in such a Tempestuous way, that no Boat can come near to take him off, and the Sea will not be calm'd till the Iron be thrown away: I being there to make an experiment of it, of∣fer'd Money to a poor fellow, to go upon the Rock, with a piece of Iron, but he would not do it on any terms.</P>
<P>Sometimes about this Country, are seen these men they call <HI>Finn-men.</HI> In the year 1682, one was seen in his little Boat, at the South end of the Isle of <HI>Eda,</HI> most of the people of the Isle flock'd to see him, and when they adventur'd to put out a Boat with Men to see if they could apprehend him, he presently fled away most swiftly. And in the year 1684, another was seen from <HI>Westra;</HI> I must acknowledge it seems a little unaccountable, how these Finn-men should come on this coast, but they must probably be driven by Storms from home, and cannot tell when they
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>
are any way at Sea, how to make their way home again; they have this ad∣vantage, that be the Seas never so boi∣sterous their Boat being made of Fish Skins, are so contrived that he can ne∣ver sink, but is like a Sea-gull swimming on the top of the Water. His shirt he has is so fastned to the Boat, that no Water can come into his Boat to do him damage, except when he pleases to unty it, which he never does but to ease nature, or when he comes ashore. A full account of these <HI>Finn-men,</HI> may be had <HI>en L'histoire naturelle &amp; moralle des Antilles</HI> Chap. 18. One of their Boats which was catched in <HI>Orkney,</HI> was sent from thence to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and is to be seen in the Physicians Hall, with the Oar and Dart he makes use of for killing Fish. There is another of their Boats in the Church of <HI>Burra</HI> in <HI>Ork∣ney.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Some peculiar Customs, Manners and Dis∣positions of the Inhabitants of this Country. An Account of a Woman that had a Child in the</HI> 63d <HI>Year of her Age. An Account of their Dis∣eases and some of their particular Cures. A particular Language amongst them. Their way of Transporting and Weighing their Corn. Their custom of Sheep-shearing: And the way they have to catch Sea-Fowls. And an Account of some Remarkable Accidents that have fallen out here.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE People here are generally civil, sagacious, circumspect and piously inclined; Though <HI>Boethius</HI> re∣ports them to be great Drunkards and <HI>Maginus</HI> says of them, <HI>quod sunt bibacis∣simi, nunquam tamen inebriantur,</HI> yet now it is not so; for though they use strong Ale and Beer (the nature of the Country requiring strong Liquor) yet generally they are Sober and Temperate, but withal much given to Hospitality
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>
and Feasting, very civil and liberal in their entertaining of Strangers, and much inclined to speak ill of those that are peevishly or niggardly dispos'd.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> tells a Story, which is still believ'd here and talk'd of as a truth, though now there be nothing of it. That at <HI>Scapa</HI> a place about a mile of <HI>Kirkwal</HI> to the South, there was kept a large cup, and when any new Bishop landed there, they filled it with strong Ale, and offer'd it to him to drink, and if he happened to drink it of chearfully, they promised to themselves a Noble Bishop, and many good years in his time.</P>
<P>In many places the Landlord has his Tenant bound to give him and his followers, a liberal Entertainment once a year, especially at <HI>Christmas</HI> (at which time the People of this Country are generally inclin'd to Feasting) and the Tenant wont fail to have good Victu∣als and strong Ale (which they call Bummock) in readiness, and will be much offended if the Landlord refuse to make merry with them.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="41"/>
The People are generally persona∣ble, and comely, <HI>Polyd. Virgil</HI> says of them, <HI>Quod statura sunt procera, semper sano corpore, pariter ac mente, quo fit ut multo longissimam degant aetatem, etsi piscibus ut plurimum victitant.</HI> The Women are Lovely and of a Beautiful countenance, and very broody and apt for generation; one <HI>Marjory Bimbister</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Evie,</HI> was in the year 1683, brought to bed of a Male child in the sixty third year of her age, as may be seen by the following attesta∣tion.</P>
<P>We under subscribers testify and de∣clare that <HI>Marjory Bimbister</HI> in the Pa∣rish of <HI>Evie</HI> in <HI>Orkney,</HI> was in <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> 1683. untimeously delivered of a Male child; though we have also sure account of her age in our Register of Baptism, yet many of the Parish who are of sixty four years, and whose age is certainly known, report that to their knowledge she is as old as they: be∣sides her self remembers, that in the year 1631, (which was a year of Fa∣mine in this Country, and from which the common People usually reckon) she was keeping Cattle, being then a
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>
Girl, as she thought; about nine or ten Years of Age. In the Year 1660, she was marry'd to <HI>Adam Hourie,</HI> to whom, about five Years after, <HI>viz. Anno</HI> 1665, she had a Child, from which time she was Barren till <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> 1683, when she was delivered of a male Child; at which time, it is pro∣bably thought, both by her Neighbors and nearest Relations, that she was at least about Sixty two or Sixty three Years.</P>

<P>By reason of the temperance of their Dyet and wholsomness of the Air, the People usually live to a great Age. A Man in the Parish of <HI>Ham</HI> dyed not many Years since, who liv'd upwards of Fourscore Years with one Wife, in a marry'd estate. There is also a Gentle∣man, yet living in <HI>Stronsa,</HI> who was Begotten of his Father when he was an hundred Years old, and did live till he saw this same Man's Children.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="42"/>
Some there be also of an exceeding high Stature, as that young Man, who, for his height, was usually call'd, <HI>The Mickle Man of Waes,</HI> as being a great deal higher than the common sort of Men. At the Chaple of <HI>Clet,</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> is a Grave to be seen, wherein, they say, a Giant was bury'd; and indeed the Stone that is laid upon the Grave is a∣bout twelve Foot long; so that, if the Body has been proportionable to the Grave, it has been exceeding Mon∣strous.</P>
<P>The more common and general Disea∣ses here are the Scurvy, Agues, Con∣sumptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Commonly in the Spring they are troubled with an Aguish Di∣stemper which they call the <HI>Axes,</HI> but for this there are <HI>Quacks</HI> amongst them that pretend an infallible Cure, by way of Diet-drink, infusing a Hotch-potch of several Plants (I suppose what are greenest at that time) in an English Gal∣lon of Ale; the Receipt is this, They take of <HI>Buckhorn, Plantain, Water Plantain, Lov∣age, wild Daisie, Rocket, Roots of Elecampane, Millefoil, Roots of Spignell, Dandelyon, Par∣sley Roots, Wormwood, Cumfrey, Tansey, Thrift</HI> or <HI>Sea-Pink; Garden Angelica,</HI> and
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>
a kind of <HI>Masterwort,</HI> the <HI>Imperatoriae assinis;</HI> of all these they take a like quan∣tity, to wit, about half a handful, and of this Infusion they drink half a Pint Morning and Evening. This is what they call the <HI>Axes Grass,</HI> and the old Women talk wonders of it, pretending there are so many of the Herbs good for the Liver, so many good for the Head, and so many for the Heart, Spleen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In Phthisical Distempers they use <HI>Arby,</HI> the <HI>Caryophyllus Marinus, Thrift</HI> or much as they call it, boyl'd with sweet Milk.</P>
<P>Instead of a Cupping-glass they have a Horn with a small thin Skin at the smaller end. The way how they use it is thus: The Surgeon with the point of his Knife gives three or four small cuts or gashes on the place where he purpo∣ses to set the Horn; and having set the broadest end on the Wounds, he sucks the small end a little, and then lets it stand till the abundance of Blood it draws makes it fall off. Some have a way, as they pretend (if they be to Cure any akeing or inward Pain) to draw out several little Worms out of the
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>
part affected, whereby they remove the Pain. Others there be that use Charms for the curing of the Rickets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but these are much curbed by their Mini∣sters.</P>
<P>All speak English, after the Scots way, with as good an Accent as any County in the Kingdom, only some of the common People, amongst themselves, speak a Language they call <HI>Norns;</HI> which they have derived to them, ei∣ther from the <HI>Pights,</HI> or some others, who first planted this Country; for by the following Lord's Prayer, in that Language, it has but little of the <HI>Da∣nish</HI> or <HI>Norwegian</HI> Language, to which I thought it should have had more affi∣nity, considering how long time they were possessors of this Country.</P>
<P><HI>Favor i ir i chimrie, Hel∣leur ir i nam thite, gilla cos∣dum thite cumma, veya thine mota vara gort o yurn sinna gort i chimrie, ga vus da on da dalight brow vora; Firgive vus sinna vora sin</HI>

<P>Since <HI>Gesner,</HI> in his <HI>Mithridates,</HI> nor Bishop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> in his <HI>Real Character,</HI> have nothing like this, I thought this Formula might not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>Anciently, as they are yet in great measure, they were much given to Su∣perstition, as appears by the many Cha∣pels that are here and there dispersed through the Country; but the Chapels to which most frequently they made their Pilgrimage, were to the Chapels of the <HI>Brough</HI> of <HI>Birsa,</HI> and to the Cha∣pel of the <HI>Brough</HI> at the <HI>Mulehead</HI> in <HI>Deirness;</HI> these two Chapels standing at the furthest extremities of the <HI>Mainland</HI> East and West; nor to this day are these Pilgrimages omitted by the common People, who still, for the obtaining of some good, or deprecating of some evil, do frequent some Chapels they have most veneration for. Besides, they have this general custome; The day that is
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>
dedicated to the Memory of the Saint who is Patron of the chief Church, where Sermon is made, is kept Holy by the common People of the whole Pa∣rish; so that they will not Work on that day: And those that live next the smaller Chapels do moreover keep holy that Day, that is dedicated to the Me∣mory of that Saint, that Chapel is de∣nominated by.</P>
<P>Here they make no use of Poaks or Sacks, but a sort of Vessel made of Straw, which they call <HI>Cassies,</HI> in which they keep and transport their Corn: Nor do they make use of Peck and Firlot, or any other Measure, for their Grain, as they use to do thorough the rest of the Kingdom, but weigh all, which they have a particular way of doing with Bismires for small Weights; and Pound∣lers, as they call them, for great Weights. In most it resembles a Stilliard that Mo∣ney is weighed on. It is a Beam of Timber marked with different weights, which hath a Stone at one end (which Stone on the Malt Poundler should be a setten weight, and on the Bear Pound∣ler sixteen Merk) and a Hook at the o∣ther end for hanging up the Cassie in
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>
which the Corn or Meal is, and there is a Ring in the middle near the Sheir that has a Pole thrust thorough it, by which, by the help of a Man at each end all is supported, that the Cassie may swim fair. The least weight is call'd a Merk, which will be eighteen Ounces, twenty four Merks make a Lecspound or Setten, six Settens make a Meil (e∣quivalent to a Boll) and eighteen Meils make a Chaldron.</P>
<P>In every Isle they have a Wart-hill, or Ward-hill, which is the most conspi∣cuous and elevated part of the Isle, on which, in time of War, they keep Ward; and when they see the Enemies Ships approaching, they put a Fire, thereby to give notice to the adjacent Isles of the nearness of the Enemy, and to advertise them to be on their Guard, or to come to their help; this they distin∣guish by the number of Fires.</P>
<P>Their Corn Land is every where Par∣ked, and without these inclosures their Sheep and Swine, and some of their Cat∣tle go at random, without a Herdsman to keep them. The most ordinary Man∣nour they have for their Land, especi∣ally in places near the Sea, is, Sea∣weed,
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>
Sea-ware, as they call it; and in Bayes, after Storms, when the Wrack is driven in greater plenty, all the Peo∣ple of the Neighbourhood come and divide the Wrack according to the pro∣portion of Land they have about that place; but methinks 'tis the greatest slavery in the World, for the common People, as they do there in Winter, to carry this Wrack in small Vessels made of Straw or Cassies on their Backs to their Land.</P>
<P>All their Sheep are marked on the Ears or Nose, every man that hath Sheep hath his own Mark, whereby his Sheep are distinguish'd from others: And 'tis strange to consider how so ma∣different Marks could be invented, as are found cut in so little room. They use to Fleece their Sheep about the be∣ginning of <HI>May,</HI> and the way they take to apprehend them (for they go wild) is both strange and pleasant. The Bai∣liff of the Parish, with the <HI>Law-right-men</HI> which are the Bailiffs Assessors, and the persons to whom the Sheep belong meet together on a day appointed, ha∣ving with them Sheep Dogs, trained up for the Hunting of them, and when
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>
they would have such a Sheep caught, they point him out by the finger to the Dog, upon which he runs and sin∣gles out that Sheep from all the rest, and never leaves of running till he catch him, which being fleec'd or shorn by the owner, they then go on and hunt for others.</P>
<P>They have also a pleasant way of ta∣king the Sea Fowls when they are young as <HI>Foists, Lyers, Kittiwaeks, Gulls</HI> &amp;c. which build very thick on shelves of high Rocks; under the Rock there is a Boat with men having a large Net, which at the two uppermost corners is fastned with two long Ropes, which are in the hands of men at the top of the Rock, who hoise up the Net till it be over against the place where the young Fowl sit, then they that are in the Boat under the Rock, have a Rattle which makes so frighting a noise, that all the young Fowls take wing and fly for∣ward into the bosom of the Net where they are caught: Then the Net is laid down in the Boat and the Prey seised upon, and thus they go from Rock to Rock taking as many as they can.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="46"/>
Others have this way in taking these Fowls, a Man that is accustomed to the exercise has a Rope well bound about his middle, with which he is let slide down the steep Rock, till he be over a∣gainst the place where the young Fowls are, of whom he apprehends as many as he is able to carry and then is hoisted up with his Prey. They use that way also in taking the young Hawks. There are some Fellows so hardy that go a catching of Sea Fowls without any help, by tying a Rope about his own mid∣dle, and tying the other end to a Stake, which he drives well in the Ground, and so lets himself go over the Rock (perhaps some hundred of fathoms) and catches what Fowls he can and then hoises himself up again.</P>
<P>Several remarkable accidents have fall'n out in this Country, besides some already mentioned. I shall instance in three or four only, whereof the witness∣es are still alive. About the year 1634, when Bishop <HI>Grahame</HI> was Bishop of this Country, a young Boy named <HI>William Garioch,</HI> his Father being dead, had some little Land, and some small portion of Cattle, left him by his Fa∣ther
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
in the Parish of <HI>Ham;</HI> his Uncle took him in his Service, and having a greedy desire after the Young mans Possessions, it happen'd that he stole a Setten of Barley (which will be about Twenty Eight pound weight) from his Uncle: For which he pursued him be∣fore the Sheriff of the Bishoprick, and the Young man, at that time about Eighteen years of Age, the Theft be∣ing proved was Sentenced to be hanged. When he was at the Gallows he prayed that God would inflict some visible Judgment on his Uncle, who because of the greedy desire he had to his little Portion, had for so small a matter procur'd his Death. It came to pass that his Uncle walking thorough the Church-Yard of <HI>Kirkwal,</HI> upon the Young mans Grave, the Bishops Dog seised on him and tore out his Throat, whereby he became a sad monument of God's wrath, against such impious greedy wretches.</P>
<P>Some years ago, one <HI>James Lenay</HI> and some others, Fishing in a Boat be∣side <HI>Auskerie,</HI> in a fair day it came to pass, that their leaning all on one side of the Boat, that it overturned and all
<PB N="76" REF="47"/>
were drowned, except the said <HI>Lenay,</HI> who by providence got up, and sat on the Keil of the Boat, in which conditi∣on he continued for the space of four days, driven by the Tides, sometime this way, and sometime that, sometimes to <HI>Westra,</HI> and back again to <HI>Stronsa,</HI> till at last he was seen floating by <HI>Spur∣ness</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> where by the careful en∣deavour of the Gentleman who was owner of the Ground he was deliver∣ed.</P>
<P>There was one <HI>John Smith</HI> who lived in <HI>Stronsa,</HI> who, with three others used to fish not far from Land; their way was to rise early and stay many Hours a Fishing. This Man having, by several days Fishing, gotten a great plenty of Fish, his Wife was desirous that he would omit that exercise for a time, and stay at home to take his rest. He was very unwilling to do so, where∣fore next Morning she rises before him, and being desirous he might take a longer Sleep, after so many days toil, she stop∣ped the holes and windows of the Room where he lay that he might sleep the more soundly, and then she went to the Fields to her work, where, working
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>
with her Servants she was surpris'd with this sad accident. The three men that used to fish with her Husband, be∣cause he came not, had taken the Boat themselves and gone a Fishing, and sud∣denly the Boat overturned (no man knows how) and the men were all drowned. This the Woman and her Servants seeing startled them greatly, but tho' she was grieved for their death, yet she was glad that her Husband (by her Policy) went not to Sea with them, and thereupon runs hastily to the house to acquaint her Husband with that sad accident, and to congratulate with him for his preservation: when opening the door she was surpris'd with a more sad and astonishing sight, even the Death of her own husband: For he having risen out of his bed, had fallen with his head in a large vessel wherein they used to make Urine, where he was choked and found dead.</P>
<P>Strange are the effects that are here sometimes produc'd by Thunder and Lightning, for by it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1670 the Steeple of the Cathedral Church at <HI>Kirkwal</HI> was burned, and sometimes it will seize on low Cottages. In the
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>
year 1680 the Lightning enter'd a Gen∣tlemans Cow-stall, where were twelve Cows standing side for side, as they used to be, and killed every other one, that is, it killed the first, and missed the second; it killed the third, and missed the fourth, and so of the rest; so that six were killed and six remained alive and untouched.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the Town of</HI> Kirkwall.</HEAD>
<P>THE only remarkable Town in all this Country is <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> an ancient Burrough long possessed by the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> by whom it was called <HI>Cracoviaca,</HI> built upon a pleasant Oyse or Inlet of the Sea, near the middle of the <HI>Mainland;</HI> narrow streeted, and about a mile in length, having a very safe Harbour and road for Ships. Here is the Seat of Justice, the Steward, Sheriff, Commissary, all of them keep∣ing their several Courts in this place. Almost all the Houses in this Town are Slaited, but the most remarkable Edi∣fices
<PB N="79" REF="48"/>
in it are the Cathedral Church and the Bishops Palace. As for the Kings Ca∣stle it is new demolished, but by the Ruins it appears to have been a strong and stately Fort, and probably built by some of the Bishops of <HI>Orkney,</HI> as would appear from a remarkable Stone set in the midst of the Wall, which looks towards the street, with a Bishops Mi∣ter and Arms engraven'd on it. There is here a publick School for the Teach∣ing of Grammar, endowed with a com∣petent Salary, and at the North end of the Town is a place built by the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s time, Ditched about, with a Breast-work, and some other Fortifications, on which they have some Cannon planted for the defence of the Harbour.</P>
<P>This Town had been erected into a Royal Burrough in the time of the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> and <HI>Anno</HI> 1486, King <HI>James</HI> the Third gave them a Charter, con∣firming their old Erection and Privi∣leges; specifying their antiquity, and giving them power to hold Burrough Courts, to incarcerate and arrest, to make Laws and Ordinances, and to elect their own Magistrates yearly for
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>
the right Government of the Town, and to have a weekly Market on <HI>Tuesday</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> and three Fairs in the Year, one about <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> the other at <HI>Lammas,</HI> and the third at <HI>Martinmas,</HI> each to conti∣nue three Days; he moreover disponed o∣ver to them some Lands about the Town, with the Customs and shore dues, and the power of a Pitt and Gallows, and all other privileges granted to any Royal Burrough within the Kingdom, exeem∣ing them from sending any Commissio∣ners to Parliament, unless their own ne∣cessities require it. This Charter is da∣ted at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the last of <HI>March</HI> 1486, and in the Year 1536 <HI>February</HI> the 8th, King <HI>James</HI> V. ratified the former Char∣ter, by a new Charter of Confirmation. And in the Year 1661 King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after his Restoration ratified the former Charters, at <HI>Whitehall May</HI> 25th, where∣upon the Parliament at <HI>Edinburgh, Au∣gust</HI> 22d 1670 confirm'd all by their Act, yet with this special provision, That what was granted to them by that Act, might not prejudice the In∣terest of the Bishop of <HI>Orkney.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is govern'd by a Provost, Four Bailiffs, and a Common Counsel, as in other Royal Burroughs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the ancient State of the Church of</HI> Orkney. <HI>Of the Cathedral Church at</HI> Kirkwall. <HI>Bishop</HI> Robert Reid<HI>'s ere∣ction of the Chapter. Bishop</HI> Law<HI>'s Transaction with King James</HI> VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Church of this Country, as also that of <HI>Zetland,</HI> was under the Government of one Bishop, stil'd Bishop of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland.</HI> The Bi∣shop's Revenue was great before, but at present, it will not amount to much more than Six hundred Pound Sterling; and now the King's Exchequer, considering how much that Country has of late been impoverished, Farm it out for Four hun∣dred Pound Sterling.</P>
<P>The Cathedral Church is St. <HI>Magnus</HI>'s Church in <HI>Kirkwall;</HI> it was founded, as is thought, by St. <HI>Magnus,</HI> or rather by <HI>Rolland</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> who founded it in memory of his Cozen St. <HI>Magnus,</HI> See the double of the Manuscript in the 8th Chapter; but it has been enlarged
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
by some of the Pious Bishops of that See; for Bishop <HI>Steward</HI> enlarged it to the East, all above the Grees, and Bi∣shop <HI>Reid</HI> three Pillars to the West. It's as beautiful and stately a Structure as is in the Kingdom, and perhaps by much the longest as it is now; for I have mea∣sur'd it, and, by some Feet, it is lon∣ger than that of St. <HI>Giles</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> it's built cross-ways, for the most part of Free-stone, standing on Pillars, all most curiously vaulted, and the Steeple elevated to a great height, in which is a set of as excellent and sweetly chim'd Bells, as are in any Cathedral of the Kingdom. In the Year 1670, the Py∣ramid of the Steeple, being cover'd with Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, was burn'd by Thunder; but by the Care of Bishop <HI>Mackenzie,</HI> and his Liberality, and some other Charita∣ble Persons, it is again Repaired.</P>
<P>Besides the Cathedral, there are one and thirty Churches more in this Coun∣try, wherein Divine Service is celebra∣ted, as also a great many ancient Cha∣pels, above an hundred in number, which shews that this Country was no less anciently than it is at present addi∣cted to Devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="50"/>
This Diocess had its several ancient Dignities and Privileges for a long time; but these, by the constant trouble this Country was in by the change of Ma∣sters, being lessen'd and grown worse, Bishop <HI>Robert Reid</HI> made a new Ere∣ction and Foundation of the Chapter, <HI>viz.</HI> Seven Dignities, whereof the first was a Provost or Dean, to whom, un∣der the Bishop, the Correction and o∣versight of the Canons, Prebendaries and Chaplains was to belong. He had al∣loted to him the Prebend of Holy Tri∣nity, and Vicarage of <HI>South-Ronalsha,</HI> with the Maintenance of the Church of <HI>Burza.</HI> 2. An Archdeacon, who was to Govern the People according to the disposition of the Canon-law, and to him was allotted the Archdeacons an∣cient Rights, the Vicarage of <HI>Birsa</HI> and Chaplainry of St. <HI>Ola,</HI> within the Ca∣thedral Church of <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> together with the Maintainance of the Church of <HI>Hara.</HI> 3. A Precentor who was to rule the Singers in the Quire, in the e∣levation or depression of their Songs; and to him was allotted the Prebend of <HI>Orphir</HI> and Vicarage of <HI>Stennis.</HI> 4. A Chancellor, who was to be learned in
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>
both Laws, and bound to read in the Pon∣tifical Law publickly in the Chapter to all that ought to be present, and to look to the preserving and mending the Books of the Quire and Register, and to keep the common Seal and Key of the Library; to him was allotted the Prebend of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> and Vi∣carage of <HI>Sanda.</HI> 5. A Treasurer, who was to keep the Treasure of the Church and Sacred Vestments, and to have a care of the Bread, Wine, Wax, Oyland Lights, for the Church; to him was al∣lotted the Rectory of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in <HI>Stronsa,</HI> and Vicarage of <HI>Stronsa.</HI> 6. A Subdean, who was to supply the place of the Provost, in his absence; to him was allotted the Personage of <HI>Hoy,</HI> and Vicarage of <HI>Waes.</HI> 7. A Subchantor, who was bound to Play on the Organs each Lord's Day and Festivals, and to supply the place of the Chantor, in his absence; to him was allotted the Pre∣bend of St. <HI>Colm.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise he erected Seven other Ca∣nons and Prebendaries, to wit, 1. The Prebendary of <HI>Holy-cross;</HI> to him was given the Personage of <HI>Crosskirk</HI> in <HI>San∣da;</HI> he was to be a special keeper of
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>
Holy things under the Treasurer, and was to take care of the Clock and Ring∣ing of the Bells at Hours appointed, and to take care that the Floor of the Church was cleanly swept. 2. The Prebendary of St. <HI>Mary;</HI> to whom was given the Chaplainry of St. <HI>Mary</HI> and Vicarage of <HI>Evie;</HI> he was to have a care of the Roof and Windows of the Cathedral, and to have them helped if need were. 3. The Prebendary of St. <HI>Magnus,</HI> to whom was allotted the Pre∣bend of St. <HI>Magnus;</HI> he was to be Con∣fessor of the Housholds of the Bishop, Provost, Canons and Chaplains, and their Servants in the time of <HI>Easter,</HI> and to administer the Eucharist to them. The 4th. Prebendary was to have the Chaplainry of St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist, in the said Cathedral Church. The 5th. Prebendary was to have the Chap∣lainry of St. <HI>Lawrence.</HI> The 6th. was to have the Prebend of St. <HI>Katharine.</HI> And the 7th. Prebendary was to have the Prebend of St. <HI>Duthas.</HI> To which seven Dignities and seven Prebendaries, he moreover assigned and allotted (be∣sides the former Churches and Titles) the Rents and Revenues of the Perso∣nages
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>
of St. <HI>Colm</HI> in <HI>Waes,</HI> and <HI>Holy-cross</HI> in <HI>Westra;</HI> as also the Vicarages of the Parish Churches of <HI>Sandwick</HI> and <HI>Strom∣nes,</HI> with their pertinents for their daily Distributions.</P>
<P>Besides these, he erected thirteen Cha∣plains; to the first was allotted the Chaplainry of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and he was to be Master of the Grammar School: To the second was allotted the Chap∣lainry of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> and he was to be Master of the Singing-School: The third was to be <HI>Stellarius</HI> or the Bishop's Choirister. The fourth the Provost Choirister. The fifth the Archdeacons. The sixth the Precentors. The seventh the Chancellors. The eighth the Trea∣surers. The ninth the Subdeans. The tenth the Prebendaries of <HI>Holy-cross.</HI> The eleventh the Prebendaries of St. <HI>Mary.</HI> The twelfth the Prebendaries of St. <HI>Katharine.</HI> The thirteenth the Cha∣plains of <HI>Holy-cross.</HI> Every one of these Choiristers were to have twenty four Meils of Corn, and ten Merks of Mo∣ney for their Stipend yearly, besides their daily distributions; which were to be raised from the Rents of the Vica∣rage of the Cathedral Church, and from the foundation of <HI>Thomas</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ork∣ney,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="52"/>
and of the twelve Pounds left by King <HI>James</HI> III. and King <HI>James</HI> IV. Kings of <HI>Scotland.</HI> To these he added a Sacrist, who was to ring the Bells, and light the Lamps, and carry in Wa∣ter and Fire to the Church, and to go before the Processions with a white Rod, after the manner of a Beadle; and for this he was to have the accustomed Re∣venue, together with forty Shillings from the Bishop yearly.</P>
<P>He moreover ordained six Boys, who were to be Taper-bearers, and to sing the Responsories and Verses in the Choire, as they were to be ordered by the Chanter. Of which six Boys, one was to be nominate and maintain'd by the Bishop; the second by the Preben∣dary of St. <HI>Magnus;</HI> the third by the Prebendary of St. <HI>John;</HI> the fourth by the Prebendary of St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> the fifth by the Prebendary of St. <HI>Katharine;</HI> the sixth by the Prebendary of St. <HI>Du∣thas:</HI> And every one of them was to have, besides their Maintenance, twen∣ty Shillings <HI>Scots</HI> a Year. To every one of the foresaid Dignities, Canons, and Prebendaries, he assigned certain Lands in <HI>Kirkwal</HI> for their Dwelling Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="53"/>
The Charter of this erection is dated at <HI>Kirkwal, October</HI> 28. <HI>Anno</HI> 1544; and in the following Year it was con∣firmed by another Charter granted by <HI>David Beaton</HI> Cardinal of St. <HI>Stephen</HI> in <HI>Mount Celio,</HI> and Archbishop of St. <HI>An∣drews,</HI> having Authority so to do. It is dated at <HI>Stirling,</HI> the last of <HI>June,</HI> and eleventh Year of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the Third; and confirm'd by Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> the last of <HI>April, Anno Regni</HI> 13.</P>
<P>In this condition the Church stood as long as Popery continued, but the Reformation coming in, and <HI>Robert Stew∣ard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> having obtain'd the Bishoprick from Bishop <HI>Bothwell,</HI> in ex∣change for the Abbacy of <HI>Holyrood-house,</HI> he became Lord of the whole Country, and he and his Son Earl <HI>Patrick,</HI> who succeeded him, did in the Church what they pleas'd.</P>
<P>At last <HI>James Law</HI> being made Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and the Earldom being uni∣ted to the Crown (by the death and forefaulture of the foresaid <HI>Patrick,</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> as we shall have occasion to speak more of in the 8th Chapter) he, with the consent of his Chapter, made
<PB N="89" REF="53"/>
a Contract with King <HI>James</HI> VI. In which they resign to the King, and his Successors, all their Ecclesiastical Lands and Possessions, with all Rights and Se∣curities belonging thereto, to be incor∣porated and united to the Crown, espe∣cially by such as should be thought ne∣cessary to be united to it; and the King gives back and dispones to the Bishop several Lands in the Parishes of <HI>Ham, Orphir, Stromnes, Sandwick, Shapinsha, Waes, Hoy,</HI> St. <HI>Ola,</HI> and of <HI>Evie, Burra,</HI> and <HI>Flotta,</HI> to be a Patrimony to the Bi∣shop and his Successors for ever; dispo∣ning moreover to him and his Successors the Right of Patronage, to present to all the Vicarages of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland,</HI> with power to them to present qualify'd Ministers as oft as any Church should vake. Disponing also to them the he∣retable and perpetual Right and Jurisdi∣ction of Sheriffship and Bailiffry within the Bishoprick and Patrimony thereof, exeeming the Inhabitants and Vassals of the Bishoprick, in all Causes, Civil and Criminal, from the Jurisdiction of the Sheriff or Steward of the Earldom. As also he gave to the Bishop and his Successors the Commissariot of <HI>Orkney</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>
and <HI>Zetland,</HI> with power to constitute and ordain Commissars or Chancellors, Clerks, and other Members of Court. This contract was made <HI>Anno</HI> 1614; and in the Year following, by an act of Platt, dated at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 22d of <HI>November,</HI> the several Dignities and Mi∣nisters both in the Bishoprick and Earl∣dom, were provided to particular Main∣tenances (besides what they were in possession of before) payable by the King and Bishop to the Ministers in their se∣verl bounds respective. And as it was agreed by that Contract, and determin'd by that Act of Platt, so are they provi∣ded for at this present.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of the Plantation of the Christian Faith in</HI> Orkney; <HI>and of the Bishops there∣of.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>NIcephorus</HI> writing that <HI>Simon Ze∣lotes,</HI> after he had preached the Gospel in several other Kingdoms, came at last <HI>ad occidentalem oceanum insulas{que} Britannicas</HI> (by which <HI>Orkney</HI> must be especially understood) and there Preach∣ed the Gospel. Whatever truth may be in that, yet it is certain, That the Christian Faith was greatly promoted in this Country about the beginning of the Fifth Century <HI>(Eugenius</HI> II. being then King of <HI>Scotland)</HI> at which time <HI>Palladius</HI> being sent by Pope <HI>Celestin</HI> to Purge that Kingdom of the Heresie of <HI>Pelagius</HI> that had infected it. He Insti∣tuted,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Servanus</HI> (call'd St. <HI>Serf</HI> in the Ca∣lender) Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> that he might instruct the Inhabitants of these Isles in the Faith of Christ, which <HI>Polyd. Virgil</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="55"/>
says he did very carefully. He was a Man of Eminent Devotion and Pie∣ty, and Master of the famous <HI>Kenti∣gern,</HI> whom he used to call <HI>Mongah</HI> (which, in the Norish Tongue, signifi∣eth, Dear Friend) which afterwards be∣came the Name by which he was usu∣ally called. From him there has been a continual Succession of Bishops in this Country; but by reason of the many alterations that fell out in it, and the loss of ancient Records, his Successors for many years are not known, yet in History we read of these that fol∣low.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>William</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> who liv'd in the time of King <HI>Robert</HI> the Third.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thomas</HI> who liv'd in the time of King <HI>James</HI> the First.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>William Tulloch,</HI> who was Bishop of this Country in the time of King <HI>James</HI> the Third; of him we read, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1468, he was sent, with several other Noble Persons, to <HI>Christiern</HI> King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> to seek his Daughter, the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> in Mar∣riage to the said King <HI>James.</HI> About <HI>July</HI> they came to <HI>Hafnen</HI> in <HI>Denmark,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="55"/>
where King <HI>Christiern</HI> then remained, and were of him joyfully received and well heard concerning their Sute; inso∣much, that, by advice of his Council, he agreed that the Lady <HI>Margaret</HI> should be given in Marriage to King <HI>James,</HI> and that the Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zet∣land</HI> should remain in the Possession of him and his Successors, Kings of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> till either the said King <HI>Christiern</HI> or his Successors in Name of Dowry should pay to King <HI>James,</HI> or his Suc∣cessors, the Sum of Fifty thousand Flo∣rins of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Upon this the Bi∣shop and the other Ambassadors return with the espoused Lady to <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> and in the Abbey Church at Holyrood-house, She was Married and Crowned Queen. Afterwards she was brought to Bed of a Son, call'd <HI>James</HI> (who afterwards succeded to the Crown) whereupon <HI>Christiern,</HI> to con∣gratulate the happy Birth of this young Prince, his Grandchild, renounced, by a Charter under his Great Seal, all the Right, Title and Claim, which he or the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> might have to the Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland.</HI> This Bi∣shop was translated from this to the
<PB N="94" REF="56"/>
Bishoprick of <HI>Murray,</HI> and continued five Years Bishop of that See, and there dying was buried in St. <HI>Maries</HI> Isle in the Canonry Church of <HI>Elgin.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. To him succeeded <HI>Andrew</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> who also liv'd in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Third, and was Bi∣shop at that time when the Town of <HI>Kirkwall</HI> got their erection into a Royal Burrough, confirm'd by the said King <HI>Anno</HI> 1486.</P>
<P N="6">6. After him succeeded <HI>Edward Stew∣ard,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> who liv'd in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Fourth; of him <HI>Boethius</HI> gives a noble Testimony. He enlarged the Cathedral Church to the East all above the Grees.</P>
<P N="7">7. To him succeeded <HI>Thomas</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> who Endowed something for the maintenance of the Choiristers of the Cathedral.</P>
<P N="8">8. After him was <HI>Robert Maxwell</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Orkney;</HI> he caused to be built the Stalls that are in the Cathedral; and it was he that caused found and made those excellent Bells that are in the Stee∣ple of the Cathedral, which, at his own expences were founded in the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in the Year 1528, in the
<PB N="95" REF="56"/>
Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Fifth, as their inscription bears. The next Year <HI>Anno</HI> 1629, <HI>May</HI> 18. The Earl of <HI>Cathnes</HI> and the Lord <HI>Sinclar</HI> came with a great Ar∣my by Sea into <HI>Orkney</HI> to have taken possession of it, as of a Country to which they pretended some Right, but the Peo∣ple of the Country, under the command of Sir <HI>James Sinclar</HI> (natural Son to <HI>Ro∣bert Sinclar,</HI> the last Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI> of that Sirname) encounted the Earl with such courage at a place call'd <HI>Summers∣dale,</HI> that his Army was wholly dis∣comfited; the Earl himself, with 500 of his Men, being killed, and the Lord <HI>Sinclar,</HI> with all the rest, taken Priso∣ners. It is said of this Sir <HI>James Sin∣clar,</HI> that presuming on his merits and the good service he had done the King, by that engagement, begg'd of King <HI>James</HI> the Fifth, then Reigning, the Isles of <HI>Sanda</HI> and <HI>Eda,</HI> which he re∣presented to him then as small Islands, or <HI>Holms,</HI> only sit for Pasture, and up∣on his Request obtain'd them; which, I conceive, may be the reason why <HI>Bu∣chanan</HI> does not reckon any of these, ei∣ther <HI>Sanda</HI> or <HI>Eda,</HI> amongst the Isles of <HI>Orkney,</HI> by being deceiv'd with that o∣pinion,
<PB N="96" REF="57"/>
that they were but Holms, whereas they are amongst the most considerable Islands in this Country; but the King being afterward better in∣formed, and that he had been imposed on by Sir <HI>James,</HI> threatned that his Head should pay for it when he came to <HI>Orkney;</HI> for fear of which, when he heard of the King's Arrival, he cast him∣self in the Sea, in a place called the <HI>Gloup</HI> of <HI>Linksness,</HI> and was drowned. The King coming in Person to this Country to settle the Troubles and Com∣motions that were in it, was nobly en∣tertain'd by the Bishop all the time of his stay, and having put a Guard in the King's and Bishop's Castles (having first visited some of the Western Isles) he returned to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> taking with him some of the Factious Gentry. At this time also the Town of <HI>Kirkwall</HI> gave such demonstrations of their Affection and Loyalty to their King, that some∣time after he ratified their Erection in∣to a Royal Burrough by a new Charter of confirmation <HI>Anno</HI> 1536</P>
<P N="9">9. To him succeeded <HI>Robert Reid</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> a very deserving, Man, of an excellent Wit and great Experi∣ence.
<PB N="97" REF="57"/>
He caus'd to be built a stately To∣wer to the North end of the Bishop's Palace, where his Statue in a stone is as yet remaining set in the Wall. He greatly enlarged the Cathedral Church, adding three Pillars to the former Fa∣brick, and decoring the entry with a magnificent Porch. He moreover built St. <HI>Olaus</HI> Church in <HI>Kirkwal,</HI> and a large Court of Houses to be a College for the instructing the Youth of this Coun∣try in Grammar and Philosophy. He made a new foundation of the Chapter, enlarging the number of Canons, Pre∣bendaries, and other Officers, and set∣ling large and ample Provisions on them, as is set down in the former Chapter. In a Book Dedicated to him by <HI>Adam Senior,</HI> a Monk of the <HI>Cisteroian</HI> Order, I find that he had a right to the Mo∣nastries of <HI>Beaulie</HI> and <HI>Kinloss;</HI> but whether he had these as Bishop of <HI>Ork∣ney,</HI> or only in <HI>commendam,</HI> I cannot determine.</P>
<P>He was in great credit with his Prince King <HI>James</HI> the Fifth, who consulted him in all his weighty Affairs. In his time he perform'd many Honourable Embassages to the Credit and Benefit
<PB N="98" REF="58"/>
of his Country. Amongst the rest he was one of those that accompanied the young Queen <HI>Mary</HI> when she was sent into <HI>France</HI> to be Married to the <HI>Dolphin</HI> (afterwards <HI>Francis</HI> the second King of <HI>France)</HI> tho' both in his going and com∣ing he had bad Fortune; for in his go∣ing the Ship he was in Perished on the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> near to <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> the Bishop and the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> that was with him hardly escaping by the Ship's Boat: And in his return from the Court of <HI>France</HI> he died at <HI>Diep,</HI> the 14th of <HI>September</HI> 1558; of whom <HI>Ant.

<PB N="100" REF="59"/>
Estates of the Kingdom, were Com∣missioned to attend the Regent, and as∣sist him in that debate. And after∣wards, at the desire of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth, Anno</HI> 1571, he, with others were sent into <HI>England,</HI> for the composing of some differences between the King∣doms.</P>
<P>He made an exchange of the Bishop∣rick of <HI>Orkney,</HI> with <HI>Robert Steward,</HI> natural Son to King <HI>James</HI> the Fifth, then Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> for the Abbacy of <HI>Holyrood-House,</HI> whereby it came to pass, that the Bishop's Son afterwards was made Lord <HI>Holyrood-House, Robert Steward</HI> being Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and also obtaining the Bishoprick of <HI>Orkney,</HI> as is said, by the exchange of the Abba∣cy of <HI>Holyrood-House</HI> which he before possessed, he and his Son Earl <HI>Patrick</HI> who succeeded him, uplifted the Rents of the Bishoprick as their own Here∣ditary Patrimony. The Church of <HI>Ork∣ney</HI> in the mean time (according to the custom then received in <HI>Scotland)</HI> be∣ing governed by a Superintendant, with Episcopal Power to direct all Church Censures, and Ordain Ministers.</P>

11. This Superintendant was Mr. <HI>James Annan,</HI> at that time Minister of the Churches of <HI>Sanda</HI> and <HI>Westra.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Anno</HI> 1606, King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth, by consent of his Parliament and assembly of the Church, having restored the Estates of Bishops in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>James Law</HI> was made Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and tho' for some time he was deprived of the Temporalities of his Bishoprick, by the Oppression of <HI>Pa∣treek</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> yet after his death he enjoy'd them peaceably. Consider∣ing, the many and great Quarrels and Mischiefs that had always been be∣tween the former Earls and Bishops of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and their several Vassals, be∣cause their Lands did lie mixed tho∣rough other; therefore he made that Transaction and Contract with King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth, of which, in the last Chapter, you have had an Account; whereby the Bishoprick is separated from the Earldom, and the Bishop is made sole Judge within his own bounds. He was a Person who King <HI>James</HI> did much respect, and often employ in se∣veral important Matters. After his E∣lection to the Bishoprick, he was, with
<PB N="102" REF="60"/>
some other Prelates, sent for by the King to Court, to advise with them about setling the State of the Church in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> And the next Year we find him presiding in the Convocation or Assem∣bly at <HI>Linlithgow.</HI> He had a chief hand in the Tryal of those Oppressions and Treasonable Acts, for which <HI>Patrick</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI> was Executed. After he had sat Bishop nine Years, he was translated from this See to the Archbi∣shoprick of <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. To him succeded <HI>George Graham</HI> Bishop of <HI>Dumblane,</HI> who sat Bishop of <HI>Orkney</HI> twenty three Years; but in the Year 1638, at the Assembly at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> he resign'd his Bishoprick.</P>
<P N="14">14. After Bishop <HI>Graham</HI> had been divested of the Bishoprick, King <HI>Charles</HI> the First did promote <HI>Robert Barron,</HI> Do∣ctor and Professor of Divinity in the Marishal College of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> to the Bi∣shoprick of this Country; but he being forced to fly to <HI>Berwick,</HI> he there died before his Consecration. In the Inter∣val of Presbytery the Rents of the Bi∣shoprick were granted to the City of <HI>E∣dinburgh</HI> till the Year 1662.</P>

<P N="16">16.

<PB N="106" REF="62"/>
affirm, who call <HI>Orkney, Antiquum Pi∣ctorum regnum.</HI> There are yet in this Country several strange Antique Hou∣ses, many of which are now overgrown with Earth, which are still by the Inha∣bitants call'd <HI>Pights</HI> Houses; and the Firth that runs betwixt this Country and <HI>Cathnes,</HI> is still from them called <HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> i. e. the Firth that runs by the Land of the <HI>Pights.</HI> Tho' <HI>Bu∣chanan,</HI> to establish his opinion, would rather have it call'd, <HI>Fretum Penthlandi∣cum,</HI> from <HI>Penthus,</HI> a Man of his mak∣ing.</P>
<P>These Verses of the Poet <HI>Claudian.</HI></P>
<L>—Maduerunt Saxone fuso</L>

<P>do evidently prove that the <HI>Pights,</HI> or some other Colony of the German Nation, particularly the <HI>Saxons,</HI> at that time were the Possessors and Inhabitants of these Northern Isles: And to this Day many of the Inhabitants use the <HI>Norns,</HI> which has yet the greatest affi∣nity with the old Gothick Language, not much differing from the Teutonick, which is supposed to be the Language the <HI>Pights</HI> used. Besides the Sirnames of the ancient Inhabitants of this Coun∣try
<PB N="107" REF="62"/>
are of a German Original, as the <HI>Seaters</HI> are so called from <HI>Seater,</HI> one of the old German Idols, which they wor∣shipped for <HI>Saturn;</HI> the <HI>Taits</HI> from <HI>Twitsh,</HI> i. e. the Dutch who got that name from <HI>Twisio,</HI> the Son of <HI>Noe</HI> and <HI>Tythea,</HI> the famous Progenitors of the Germans; the <HI>Keldas,</HI> from the anci∣ent <HI>Culdees</HI> or <HI>Kelders,</HI> who (as <HI>Spots∣wood</HI> thinks) were the ancient Priests or Ministers of the Christian Religion amongst the <HI>Pights,</HI> so called because they lived in Cells; the <HI>Backies</HI> from some small running Water, which, in the ancient Teutonick, is call'd <HI>Backie:</HI> So the names that end in <HI>stane,</HI> which are very frequent in this Country, as <HI>Hourstane, Corstane, Yorstane, Beistane,</HI> &amp;c. which is a Pictish or Teutonick termination of Sirname, signifying the superlative degree of comparison; and many more reasons might be added, if it were needful, to shew that the Pictish Blood is, as yet, in this Country, and that that People were the first Possessors of it.</P>
<P>These <HI>Pights,</HI> as is generally acknow∣ledg'd, were of a German descent, com∣ing, at first, from that part of <HI>Germany</HI> that borders on the Baltick Sea, where,
<PB N="108" REF="63"/>
at present,, are the Dukedoms of <HI>Mec∣kleburgh</HI> and <HI>Pomerania.</HI> They were so called because they were notable Warriours and Fighters; their true Name (as <HI>Verstegan</HI> says) being <HI>Phigh∣tian;</HI> that is, <HI>Phighters</HI> or <HI>Fighters.</HI> They were by the Romans call'd <HI>Picts,</HI> tho' some of them call'd them <HI>Pictavi,</HI> and might have been so called of them, ei∣ther from some resemblance of that name of <HI>Phightian</HI> that they took to them∣selves, or from their singular Beauty and comely Form, as if they had been a painted People; and so <HI>Boethius,</HI> in his character of them, puts both these properties together, saying of them, <HI>Quod erant corporibus robustissimis can∣didis{que};.</HI> The like saith <HI>Verstegan</HI> of them, That they were tall and strong of Bo∣dy, and of a very fair Complexion; and so it is to this day; there being no People in <HI>Scotland</HI> that more resemble the <HI>Pights</HI> in these qualities, than the generality of the <HI>Orkney</HI> Men and Wo∣men do, being generally strongly built, and very beautiful and lovely. Or the Romans might have call'd them <HI>Picts,</HI> because, being a People much delighting in Wars, they had their Sheilds paint∣ed
<PB N="109" REF="63"/>
with divers colours, for <HI>Alex. ab A∣lex. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>gen. dierum Cap.</HI> 22. observes, That it was the way of the German Nation so to do, saying, <HI>Germani scuta lectissimis coloribus distinxere:</HI> Though I think it more probable they were called so, because to make themselves more ter∣rible to their Enemies, they used to paint their Bodies with the Images of diffe∣rent Beasts, or imprint them on their Flesh with some Iron Instruments, which has given occasion to <HI>Claudian</HI> to say of them.</P>
<L>—Ferro{que} not at as</L>
<L>Perlegit exanimes Picto moriente Figuras.</L>
<P>But at what time these <HI>Pights</HI> first planted these Isles is somewhat contro∣verted by our Historians. Some say that in the Year of the World 4867, the <HI>Pights</HI> having left their native Country, to seek out some new Habitation to them∣selves, came first to <HI>Orkney,</HI> where they left a Colony to plant the Country, and then with their main body Ferrying o∣ver <HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> and passing tho∣rough <HI>Cathnes, Ross, Murray, Marr</HI> and <HI>Angus,</HI> at last setled themselves in <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Lothian,</HI> which, from them, by our
<PB N="110" REF="64"/>
Writers, is call'd <HI>Pictlandia.</HI> Others think that the <HI>Pights</HI> did not settle here till the time of <HI>Reuther</HI> King of Scots; at which time the Scots by an intestine division warring upon one another, each party being assisted by considerable num∣bers of the <HI>Pights;</HI> they fought so de∣sperately, that besides <HI>Gethus</HI> King of the <HI>Pights,</HI> the greatest number of both the Scots and Pictish Nobility were killed, together with many thousands of the Commons of both Nations; which great slaughter, with the Invasion of the <HI>Britains</HI> at that time, constrained the <HI>Pights</HI> (who perceived themselves unable to resist them) to fly to the more Northern parts of the Kingdom, and so to <HI>Orkney,</HI> where they abode for a time, and made <HI>Gothus,</HI> the Brother of the foresaid <HI>Gethus,</HI> their King; and after some years having left some few of their number to People and Plant this Country, they returned to <HI>Lothian,</HI> and having expell'd the <HI>Britains,</HI> setled them∣selves again in their ancient Posses∣sions.</P>
<P>This Country being thus planted, the People grew and multiplied, and, for a long time, were governed by Kings
<PB N="111" REF="64"/>
of their own, after the manner of the <HI>Pights</HI> and other Nations. There is still a place in this Country, that by reason of its name and antique Form would seem to be the residence of some of these Kings; it is call'd <HI>Coninsgar,</HI> or the King's House; 'tis in the Parish of <HI>Sand∣wick</HI> in the Mainland; but the memory and actions of these Kings are, by the injury of Time and carelessness of our Writers, bury'd in silence; so that only we find mention made of these two, <HI>Belus</HI> King of <HI>Orkney; Holinshed</HI> calls him <HI>Bladus,</HI> and <HI>Boethius Balus;</HI> but it is more probable he was called <HI>Belus;</HI> for there is at this time still re∣maining a Stone in the Church of <HI>Birsa</HI> (where probably the King had his prin∣cipal residence, as to this day one of the Earls chiefest Palaces is remaining) hav∣ing this name <HI>Belus</HI> engraven on it in ve∣ry odd ancient characters, which has probably been taken from some ancient Buildings thereabouts. This Prince, upon what provocation is not recorded, levied an Army, and crossing <HI>Pight∣land-Firth,</HI> Invaded <HI>Cathnes</HI> and <HI>Ross,</HI> making Prey of all he met with; but <HI>Ewen</HI> the second being at that time King
<PB N="112" REF="65"/>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> hearing of this Invasion, came with his Army so unexpectedly upon him, and assaulted him so vigorou∣sly, that he put his Soldiers to flight, a great many escaping by Boat, but <HI>Belus</HI> himself was put to that strait that he slew himself, lest he should fall into his Enemies hands.</P>
<P>After him we read of another King of <HI>Orkney,</HI> call'd <HI>Ganus,</HI> in the time of <HI>Caratacus</HI> King of <HI>Scots;</HI> and of him it is reported, by <HI>Boethius,</HI> that he, with his Wife and Children, were carry'd Captives to <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Claudius Caesar</HI> when he went from <HI>Britain;</HI> and <HI>Her∣mannus Shedel</HI> in his general History of the several Ages of the world, speaking of the Emperor <HI>Claudius,</HI> says, <HI>Quod in∣sulas Orchades Romano adjecit imperio; sexto quo profectus erat mense Romam rediit &amp; triumphavit maximo apparatu.</HI> This <HI>Juvenal</HI> takes notice of when he says in his second Satyr,</P>
<L>Littora Juvernae promovimus, &amp; modo (captas</L>
<L>Orcadas, &amp; minima contentos nocte Bri∣tannos.</L>
<P><PB N="113" REF="65"/>
A little after this the <HI>Romans</HI> had not such cause to triumph over <HI>Orkney;</HI> for when <HI>Agricola</HI> was their General in <HI>Bri∣tain Anno Christi</HI> 87, as <HI>Henry Isaacson</HI> computes it in his Chronological Ta∣bles; he sent a Navy to sail about <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> to discover the largeness of it, and whether it was an Island or not; and after they had coasted many days to∣wards the North, they came at last in sight of <HI>Orkney</HI> (which <HI>Tacitus,</HI> for want of better information, imagines to be unknown before that time) but fearing to pass thorough <HI>Pightland-Firth</HI> for fear of Shallows, they seized some of the Country People that liv'd in the next Islands, constraining them to go aboard and pilot them thorough the Firth; but they suspecting that the <HI>Romans</HI> had a hostile design on their Country, not caring for their own Lives, they enter'd the Strait at such an inconvenient time, that the Ships were born with the vio∣lence of the stream against Rocks and Shelves in such a manner, that they were all almost torn, broke and lost without recovery, only some few of the Navy that were not so hasty to follow, per∣ceiving the sad loss of their fellows, re∣turned
<PB N="114" REF="66"/>
by the same way they came and reported these lamentable Tidings to <HI>Agricola:</HI> And indeed there is a place in <HI>Shapinsha,</HI> over against which are im∣petuous Tides and dangerous Shallows at this day, call'd <HI>Agricola;</HI> but whe∣ther it got that name from this accident I am not able to determine.</P>
<P>But yet it seems that <HI>Orkney</HI> was a considerable thing in the Eyes of the Romans: For <HI>Polyd. Virgil. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Ang. Historiae,</HI> speaking of the division of the Empire among the Sons of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, reckons <HI>Orkney</HI> amongst the famous Kingdoms that fell to the share of his Son <HI>Constantine;</HI> says he, <HI>Huic sorte evenit Britannia cum Gallia, Hispa∣nia &amp; Orchadibus.</HI></P>
<P>This Country it's like continued thus under the Government of their own Princes, till the fatal Ruine and Sub∣version of the Pictish Kingdom in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> in the Year 839; at which time <HI>Keneth</HI> the second, that Martial King of Scots having in many Battles over∣thrown the <HI>Picts,</HI> at last expell'd them out of all <HI>Scotland,</HI> seizing on <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Lothian,</HI> and the other large Territo∣ries that they had therein; he pursued
<PB N="115" REF="66"/>
them to <HI>Orkney,</HI> vanquishing these Isles and adding them to his other Domi∣nions.</P>
<P><HI>Orkney</HI> being thus annex'd to the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it continued many years under the Government of the Scot∣tish Kings and their Lieutenants, till about the Year 1099, at which time <HI>Donald Bain,</HI> Lord of the Isles, having usurped the Crown, and caused him∣self to be proclaimed King of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and being thereupon hardly put to it by the injur'd Heir and discontented Nobili∣ty, that he might not lose what he had unjustly usurped, he invited <HI>Magnus</HI> King of <HI>Norway</HI> to come to his assistance, with an offer of the Isles for his pains; who coming with his Navy Invaded <HI>Orkney</HI> and the Western Isles, putting Garrisons in all convenient places.</P>
<P>By this means the <HI>Norwegians</HI> got possession of this Country, who held it for the space of 164 years, when they came to lose all again upon this occasion: <HI>Anno</HI> 1263, <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third being then King of <HI>Scotland, Atho</HI> (by some called <HI>Hagin)</HI> King of <HI>Nor∣way,</HI> hoping from the divisions that were then in the Kingdom, and the Famine
<PB N="116" REF="67"/>
that was then sore pressing the Land, to make some further conquest in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> he comes with a great Navy and Army of <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians</HI> to the West Isles, and conquers <HI>Arran</HI> and <HI>Bute</HI> (which were the only Isles at that time under the dominion of the <HI>Scots)</HI> and from this success hoping for grea∣ter matters, he lands on the Continent and takes in the Town and Castle of <HI>Air.</HI> But King <HI>Alexander</HI> having as∣sembled a great Army, assaults him in Battle at <HI>Largis,</HI> kills his Nephew, a Man of great Renown, and after a great Slaughter of his Soldiers (to the num∣ber of twenty four thousand) puts the remainder to flight. Immediately upon this defeat King <HI>Acho</HI> hears of another sad loss; namely, That his Fleet by a Storm were all cast away and broken against the Rocks, except four in which he presently embarked and fled away to <HI>Orkney;</HI> being come thither, he sent to <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> for a new Ar∣my and Fleet, with an intention again to Invade <HI>Scotland</HI> the next Summer; but he died the beginning of the fol∣lowing Year, <HI>January</HI> 22, <HI>Anno</HI> 1264, and was bury'd in that place where
<PB N="117" REF="67"/>
the Cathedral now stands, under a Mar∣ble Stone which is seen to this day, and goes under the name of his Monu∣ment.</P>
<P>After his death King <HI>Alexander</HI> Inva∣ded the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> and the Western Isles, which, after some opposition, he recover'd, and intending to make the like attempt for the recovery of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland;</HI> there came Ambassadors to him from <HI>Magnus</HI> King of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Acho</HI> in these Kingdoms; after several Treaties it was at last condescended upon that King <HI>Alexander</HI> should pay to the King of <HI>Norway</HI> the Summ of 4000 Merks Sterling, with the Summ of 100 Merks by year; and that for this <HI>Magnus</HI> King of <HI>Norway</HI> should quit all Right that he might pretend to the Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland,</HI> and the other Isles of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which accordingly he did, by Let∣ters under his Great Seal, renouncing and giving over all Right and Claim that he had or might have both for him and his Successors to these and all the other Isles of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and, for the bet∣ter confirmation hereof, a Marriage was agreed upon betwixt the Lady
<PB N="118" REF="68"/>
<HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Hangonanus</HI> (or <HI>Haningo</HI> or <HI>Aquin</HI> as o∣thers call him) Son to King <HI>Magnus,</HI> both Children, to be completed when they came to a Marriagable Estate.</P>
<P><HI>Orkney</HI> being in this manner recover'd from the hands of the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Nor∣wegians,</HI> it continued ever after annexed to the Crown of <HI>Scotland;</HI> King <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> giving the property of it to a No∣bleman sirnamed <HI>Speire,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cathnes,</HI> whose Son <HI>Magnus Speire</HI> Earl of <HI>Cath∣nes, Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland,</HI> was in great repute in the days of King <HI>Robert Bruce.</HI></P>
<P>But he dying without Heirs Male, his Daughter <HI>Elizabeth Speire</HI> succeeded him in the Estate, and was Married to Sir <HI>William Sinclar,</HI> who accompany'd Sir <HI>James Douglass</HI> when he went to ac∣company the <HI>Bruces</HI> Heart to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> He was great Grandchild to <HI>Willielmus de Sancto claro,</HI> second Son to <HI>Valdosius</HI> Earl of <HI>Saint Claire</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> This Sir <HI>William Sinclar,</HI> by his Wife <HI>Elizabeth Speire,</HI> had a Son call'd <HI>William</HI> also, who was made Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zet∣land</HI> by King <HI>David Bruce.</HI> He was first Marry'd to <HI>Florentina,</HI> Daughter

to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and after her death was Marry'd to <HI>Jane Halyburton,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Walter</HI> Lord <HI>Dirleton.</HI></P>
<P>To him succeeded <HI>Henry Sinclar,</HI> u∣sually call'd Prince of <HI>Orkney;</HI> he was also made Duke of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> by <HI>Chri∣stiern</HI> the first King of <HI>Denmark.</HI> He Marry'd <HI>Geils</HI> or <HI>Egidia Dowglass</HI> Daugh∣ter to <HI>William Dowglass</HI> Lord of <HI>Niddis∣dale,</HI> and of <HI>Geils Stewart</HI> Daughter to King <HI>Robert</HI> the Second. So much was he favour'd by King <HI>Robert</HI> the Third, that when he was to send his Son Prince <HI>James</HI> (afterward King <HI>James</HI> the First) to <HI>France,</HI> he appointed this <HI>Henry,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orkney,</HI> to be his Governor, who taking Ship with him at the <HI>Bass,</HI> came as far as <HI>Flamburgh-head,</HI> but by reason of the Sickness and Indisposition of the young Prince, they were necessi∣tated to land, and so were both detain∣ed Prisoners by the English. He had a Daughter call'd <HI>Beatrix Sinclar,</HI> who was Marry'd to <HI>James</HI> the gross Earl of <HI>Douglass:</HI> And in the Inscription that is on her Tomb at <HI>Douglass,</HI> her Father, the Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> is stil'd Lord of the Isles, and Lord <HI>Sinclar.</HI></P>

<P>To him succeeded his Son <HI>Patrick Stuart</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney.</HI> He was a great Oppressor of the Country: <HI>Spotswood</HI>'s character of him is in these words. <Q>This Nobleman (says he) having un∣done his Estate by Riot and Prodi∣gality, did seek, by unlawful Shifts, to repair the same; making unjust Acts in his Courts, and exacting Pe∣nalties for the breach thereof; if any Man was try'd to have concealed a∣ny thing that might infer a pecunia∣ry mulct, and bring profit to the Earl, his Lands and Goods were declared confiscated; or if any Person did sue for justice before any other Judge than his Deputies, his Goods were eschea∣ted; or if they went forth of the Isles without his Licence, or his Deputies, upon whatsoever occasion, they should forefault their Moveables; and, which of all his acts were most inhumane, he ordain'd, That if any Man was try'd to supply or give Relief unto Ships, or any Vessels distressed by tem∣pest, the same should be punished in
<PB N="142" REF="80"/>
his Person, and fined at the Earl's Pleasure.</Q> So far <HI>Spotswood.</HI></P>
<P>These Acts produceed by the Com∣plainers and confessed by the Earl him∣self, were by the King's Privy Council discerned unlawful, and the practice thereof prohibited in all times.</P>
<P>These Oppressions moved King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth, that he might deliver these injur'd People from so great a Tyran∣ny, to purchase Sir <HI>John Arnot</HI>'s Right, to whom the Earl had given the Mor∣gage of his Estate, and so he took the Country into his own hand, sending Sir <HI>James Stuart</HI> to it, whom he made Chamberlain and Sheriff of the Coun∣try, who came and took possession of the Castles of <HI>Kirkwall</HI> and <HI>Birsa</HI> in the King's Name.</P>
<P>The Earl at this time being Priso∣ner in the Castle of <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> sent his natural Son <HI>Robert Stuart</HI> with an express Command to retake these Hou∣ses again; who accordingly did so. But the Earl of <HI>Cathnes</HI> being commis∣sioned by the King to be Lieutenant in these bounds, with Order to recover these Castles and pacify the Country: Shortly after his coming, he took in the
<PB N="143" REF="80"/>
Castle of <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> which he demolish∣ed, and in it seized on the said <HI>Robert Stuart,</HI> with some of the Earl's Ser∣vants, whom he sent to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where shortly after they were hang'd. And the next Year, being <HI>February</HI> the 6th 1614, the Earl himself, for several treasonable Acts and Oppressions pro∣ven against him (being brought from <HI>Dumbarton</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh)</HI> was there Be∣headed. He was a Man of profuse spending, and the Builder of that beau∣tiful Fabrick, which afterwards was appropriated to be the Manse of the Bi∣shops of <HI>Orkney.</HI> The King by these means being fully possessed of this Coun∣try, he made Sir <HI>James Stuart</HI> Lord <HI>Ochiltrie</HI> Chamberlain and Sheriff, as is said. After whom others succeeded to be Governors in it, till the Year 1647; at what time <HI>William Douglass</HI> Earl of <HI>Mor∣ton</HI> got a Wadset or Morgage of this Country from King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>To him succeeded his Son <HI>Robert Dou∣glass</HI> Earl of <HI>Morton, Anno</HI> 1649; in which Year the Marquiss of <HI>Montrose</HI> came to this Country, from <HI>Holland,</HI> with several Commanders and some Companies of Foreign Soldiers; and ha∣ving
<PB N="144" REF="81"/>
staid some few Months in <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> he there raised some Forces, most of which were either killed or taken Pri∣soners at that unfortunate encounter of <HI>Carbersdale.</HI></P>
<P>To him succeeded, in the possession of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland,</HI> his Son <HI>William Douglass</HI> Earl of <HI>Morton. Anno</HI> 1664, or thereabouts, in the first Dutch Wars, there was a great Ship, call'd <HI>The Car∣melan of Amsterdam,</HI> cast away at <HI>Zet∣land,</HI> in which Ship (as was said) were some Chests of Coin'd Gold, which were seiz'd on by some who acted for the Earl; whereupon the Lords of the Trea∣sury call'd the Earl to an Accompt, and so redeemed the Morgage of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zetland,</HI> and obtain'd a Decreet of De∣clarator against him; and in the Year 1669, these Countries of <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Zet∣land,</HI> thus redeemed from the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> were (excepting the Bishops in∣terest) re-annexed to the Crown, and erected into a Stewardry by Act of Par∣liament.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Orkney</HI> hath been a Honoura∣ry Title several ways, to several: <HI>Belus</HI> and <HI>Ganus</HI> (as we have read) were Kings of <HI>Orkney, Henry</HI> and <HI>William Sinclars</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="81"/>
were stil'd Princes of <HI>Orkney, Bothwel,</HI> by Patent from Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> was made Duke of <HI>Orkney,</HI> and the Lords of this Country of the Sirname of <HI>Sinclar</HI> and <HI>Stuart</HI> were entituled Earls of <HI>Orkney,</HI> as were the Earls of <HI>Morton</HI> when they had possession of this Country, and at present the Right Honourable <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> Brother to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> has the honou∣rary Title of this Country, but they have ever since the Year 1669, when these Countries were again adjoyn'd to the Crown, been governed by those they call <HI>Stewards</HI> of <HI>Orkney.</HI> The Kings Ex∣chequer gives a Lease to any that gives highest for it at a Roup. The present Farmers and Taxmen have it for Eigh∣teen hundred Pounds Sterling; so low by the oppression and changing of Tax∣men has this Country fall'n, being rec∣kon'd, in the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI>'s time, to near three thousand and five hundred Pounds; when the Taxmens Lease is out, which is commonly in three or five Years, the Lords of the Treasury Roup it of new, and he that bids most is Tax∣man and Steward for the Lease of Years he takes it for.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="82"/>
The Government of the <HI>Steward</HI> is in the King's bounds, the manner and procedure of his Jurisdiction is after the form of Sheriffship, the Title only diffe∣ring. The Bishops part is governed by a Sheriff, both he and the Kings Steward have one and the same man∣ner of punishing of Delinquents, and administration of Justice, and that ac∣cording to the custom and practise of other Shires in the Kingdom; Both their seats of Justice is at <HI>Kirkwal.</HI></P>
<P>Under the Sheriff and <HI>Steward,</HI> are some Judges of their Creation and Ap∣pointment called <HI>Baliffs.</HI> In every Pa∣rish and Isle there is one. Their Office is to oversee the manners of the Inha∣bitants, to hold Courts, and to decern in civil petty matters to the value of ten Pounds Scots, but if the matter be above that, it is referred to the Sheriff or Steward, or their Deputies under and subservient to these Bailiffs, are six or seven of the most honest and in∣telligent persons, within the Parish called <HI>Lawrightmen.</HI> These in their re∣spective bounds, have the oversight of the People, in the fashion of Constables, and delate to the Bailiff such enormi∣ties
<PB N="147" REF="82"/>
as occasionally fall out, which the Bailiffs punish according to the impor∣tance and circumstances of the Fault, and if it be above his limits or extent of his Power, he sends the delinquent to the seat of Justice, either to the Stew∣ard or Sheriff respective.</P>
<P>These <HI>Lawrightmen</HI> have a privilege inherent to their Office, by the custom of the Country, which is not usual elsewhere: and it is this, if there be at any time any suspicion of Theft, they take some of their Neighbours with them, under the silence of the night and make search for the Theft, (which is called <HI>Ransalling)</HI> they search every house they come to, and if the Theft be found, they seise upon him with whom it is found and bring him to the seat of Justice for Punish∣ment.</P>

<HEAD><HI>An Essay concerning the</HI> Thule <HI>of the Ancients.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is no place oftner mentio∣ned by the Ancients than <HI>Thule,</HI> and yet it is much controverted what place it was; some have attempted the discovery of it, but have gone wide of the marks the Ancients left concern∣ing it; yet they seem all to agree that it was some place towards the North, and very many make it to be one of the British Isles, and since <HI>Conradus Cel∣tes</HI> saith it is encompassed with the <HI>Orkney</HI> Isles. It will not be amiss to subjoyn to the description of <HI>Orkney,</HI> this Essay concerning it.</P>
<P>Some derive the name <HI>Thule</HI> from the <HI>Arabick</HI> word <HI>Tule,</HI> which signi∣fies farr off, and as it were with allu∣sion to this the Poets usually call it, <HI>ultima Thule,</HI> but I rather preferr the reason of the name given by the lear∣ned <HI>Bochartus,</HI> who makes the same to be <HI>Phaenician,</HI> and affirmeth that it signifieth <HI>Darkness</HI> in that language.

<P>And indeed this derivation of the word carries more reason than any other they give it, and is an evident proof that the ancients agreed in placing their <HI>Thule</HI> towards the North: we shall see next what Northern Country they pitched on for it.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="84"/>
The ancients seem most to agree that <HI>Thule</HI> was one of these Isles that are called British. <HI>Strabo</HI> one of the most ancient and the best of Geogra∣phers extant saith, <HI>Pythias Massiliensis, circa Thulen Britannicarum insularum sep∣tentrionalissimam ultima ait esse.</HI> Yet he himself maketh it nearer than <HI>Pythias</HI> did; <HI>Ego autem illum septentrionalem fi∣nem multo propius meridiem versus existi∣mo, qui enim hodie terras perlustrant ul∣tra Hyberniam nihil possunt referre, quae non longe versus septentrionem ante Bri∣tannicam jacet plane ferorum hominum domicilium &amp; propter frigus male inco∣lentium, ibi ergo finem constituendum cen∣seo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Catullus, Carmine ad Furium</HI> seems to be of this mind in these Verses.</P>

And <HI>Silius Italicus lib.</HI> 1 in these Verses,</P>
<L>Coerulus haud aliter cum demicat Incola Thules</L>
<L>Agmina falcifero circumvenit acta covino.</L>
<P>For it appears from <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Commen∣taries that the blewish Colour and the fighting out of the hooked Chariots were in use with the inhabitants in <HI>Britain. Pliny</HI> likewise seems to be of this opinion, for he treats of <HI>Thule</HI> in the same Chapter where he treats of the <HI>British Isles,</HI> and <HI>Tacitus, vita Agricolae</HI> saith when the Roman Navy sailed a∣bout <HI>Britain, despecta est &amp; Thule.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ireland</HI> properly so called was pro∣bably the first of the <HI>British Isles</HI> that got the name <HI>Thule,</HI> as being the first the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> met with steering their course from <HI>Cadiz</HI> to the West. And hence it is we find <HI>Statius, Sylva tertia ad Claudiam uxorem</HI> calls <HI>Thule, Hesperia.</HI></P>
<L>—Et si gelidas irem mansurus ad Arctos,</L>
<L>Vel super Hesperiae vada caligantia Thules.</L>
<P><PB N="152" REF="85"/>
And seemeth to be the same said by <HI>Aristotle</HI> to have been discovered by the <HI>Carthaginians, lib. de mirabil. auscul∣tat.</HI> where he saith, <HI>extra a columnas Her∣culis aiunt in mari a Carthaginensibus in∣sulam fertilem desertam{que} inventam, ut quae tam sylvarum copia, quam fluminibus navigationi idoneis abundet, cum reliquis fructibus flore at vehementer, distans à con∣tinente plurimum Dierum itinere, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Bochartus</HI> confirms this by what he observes that the ancient writer <HI>An∣tonius Diogenes,</HI> who wrote twenty four Books of the strange things related of <HI>Thale,</HI> not long after the time of <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> the great, had his History from the <HI>Cypress Tables</HI> digged at <HI>Tyrus</HI> out of the Tombs of <HI>Mantima</HI> and <HI>Derce∣lis,</HI> who had gone from <HI>Tyrus</HI> to <HI>Thule,</HI> and had staid some time there.</P>
<P>But though this be the first <HI>Thule</HI> discover'd by the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> yet it is not that mention'd by the Roman writers, for they speak of the <HI>Thule</HI> in which the <HI>Romans</HI> were and made con∣quest of; but it is certain they were ne∣ver in <HI>Ireland</HI> properly so called. That they were in <HI>Thule</HI> appears from these Verses in <HI>Statius lib.</HI> 5. <HI>protreptico ad Cris∣pinum.</HI></P>

<P>The words <HI>Caledonio</HI> and <HI>Trucis In∣cola terrae</HI> do show that by <HI>Thule,</HI> is
<PB N="154" REF="86"/>
meant the North part of <HI>Britain</HI> which was then possessed by the <HI>Pights</HI> de∣signed by the name <HI>Caledonios,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> designed by <HI>Trucis incola terrae.</HI> The same Epither <HI>Claudian</HI> gives to the <HI>Scots</HI> in these Verses,</P>
<L>Venit &amp; extremis legio praetenta Bri∣tannis,</L>
<L>Quae Scoto dat fraena truci.</L>
<P>And of this North part of <HI>Britain,</HI> that Verse of <HI>Juvenal</HI> is likewise to be understood.</P>

<P>Now <HI>Thetis</HI> in these Verses and the <HI>undae Hyperboreae</HI> in the Verses before mentioned cannot be understood of the Sea between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> for <HI>Ireland</HI> lyeth to the South of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Province; and the Situation of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Pights</HI> Country is to the North of it: for it was separate by the two <HI>Firths</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> and <HI>Clide</HI> from the <HI>Roman</HI> Province, which does clear∣ly show it was to be understood of them, which is also imported by the words <HI>Hyperboreas undas</HI> and <HI>Remis,</HI> which cannot be understood of the Irish Sea which is to the South of the Roman Province, and is very tempestuous and cannot so well be past by Oars as the <HI>Firths</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> and <HI>Clide;</HI> but the same Poet has put this without all doubt in these Verses,</P>

beyond <HI>Ierne</HI> the Country of the <HI>Pights</HI> which lies to the North of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> and upon the German Sea, and is designed in these words, <HI>mi∣nima contentos nocte Britannos;</HI> all which particularly relate to <HI>Ross</HI> and <HI>Cath∣nes.</HI> And the Inhabitants of this <HI>Ju∣berna</HI> and <HI>Thule</HI> are the very same the Panegyrist <HI>Eumenius</HI> speaks of in his Oration to <HI>Constantine</HI> the great; where he saith that the Nation of <HI>Britain</HI> in the time of <HI>Caesar,</HI> was <HI>rudis &amp; soli Britanni Pictis modo, &amp; Hibernis assue∣ta hostibus Seminudis:</HI> They had not been in use of War, but with these half naked people of the <HI>British Soil,</HI> the <HI>Pights</HI> and the <HI>Irish,</HI> who for their loose and short Garments may to this day be called half naked.</P>
<P>They were called <HI>Hyberni</HI> as being at first a Colony from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and as possessing that tract of the Isle of <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> which is called by the ancient writers <HI>Ierne glacialis</HI> and <HI>Ierne</HI> sim∣ply and by the writers of the middle age <HI>Hybernia</HI> as may be seen in the <HI>Roman Martyrology, Martyrol.

<PB N="160" REF="89"/>
Irish writer yet could say that in <HI>Ireland</HI> properly so called there ever was a Town or Bishops See called <HI>Aberdeen</HI> or a River called <HI>Don.</HI></P>
<P>And that this part of <HI>Britain</HI> then possessed by the <HI>Scots,</HI> was called <HI>Hy∣bernia,</HI> is clear from the testimony of venerable <HI>Bede Ecclesiast. hist. lib.</HI> 4. cap. 26. who names it <HI>Hybernia</HI> in the beginning of the Chapter and in the next page calls the same Country <HI>Sco∣tia.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certain that as the Wall be∣twixt <HI>Tyne</HI> and <HI>Solway Firth,</HI> called <HI>Mu∣rus Picticus,</HI> was built to exclude the <HI>Pights,</HI> so was that betwixt <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Dumbarton Firth</HI> to exclude the <HI>Scots</HI> highlanders, and was designed first by <HI>Agricola,</HI> as appears from <HI>Taci∣tus vita Agricolae</HI> where he saith, <HI>nam Glotta &amp; Bodotria diversi maris aestu per immensum revecti, angusto terrarum spa∣tio dirimuntur, quod tum praesidiis firma∣batur: atque omnis propior sinus tenebatur; summotis velut in aliam insulam hostibus:</HI> That is, for <HI>Clide</HI> and <HI>Forth</HI> two arms of two contrary Seas shooting mightily into the Land, were only divided a∣sunder by a narrow Partition of Ground,
<PB N="161" REF="89"/>
which passage was guarded and forti∣fied then with Garrisons and Castles, so that the <HI>Romans</HI> were absolute Lords of all on this side having cast out the enemies as it were into another Island; and indeed as <HI>Tacitus</HI> remarks, <HI>inven∣tus in ipsa Britannia terminus;</HI> so the <HI>Romans</HI> made this indeed the outmost limit of their province, and gave the name <HI>Britain</HI> to that part of the Island within the Roman Wall which was built on this narrow neck of Ground between the two <HI>Firths.</HI></P>
<P>And hence it is that the venerable <HI>Bede</HI> calleth those people that dwell be∣yond the Wall, <HI>Transmarinae gentes,</HI> but explaineth himself thus <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>Transmarinas autem dicimus has gentes, non quod extra Britanniam sunt positae, sed quia à parte Britonum erant remotae, duobus sinubus maris interjacentibus, quo∣rum unus ab orientali maria alter ab occiden∣tali, Britanniae terras longe late{que} irrum∣pit:</HI> And a little before this he tells who these <HI>Transmarinae gentes</HI> were, <HI>viz.

is to be meant of that part, which is now called <HI>Strathern</HI> and the rest of <HI>Perthshire</HI> and the West Highlands, the Country of the <HI>Scots,</HI> designed by <HI>Bede, à Circio,</HI> which are truly so situated in respect to the <HI>Roman</HI> Province; and this we will make out from what we meet with in <HI>Tacitus, vita Agricola,</HI> for first he saith, <HI>Tertius expeditionum an∣nus novas gentes aperuit, vastatis us{que} ad Taum (aestuario nomen est) nationibus.</HI> The third years expedition discover'd people they were not before acquainted with, having over-run all those that were on this side <HI>Tay,</HI> which he de∣scribes to be a <HI>Firth.</HI> It appears by this they were other people than these he had to do with before, because they are called <HI>novae gentes.</HI> In the next place he says the fourth Summer was
<PB N="163" REF="90"/>
spent in taking possession of what they had over-run, and he observes in that expedition the small <HI>Isthmus,</HI> or neck of Land that keeps <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Forth</HI> from meeting, and this was so secured by Garrisons, <HI>Summotis velut in aliam insu∣lam hostibus,</HI> that the enemy by these means were removed as it were into another Isle. Now if we will compare what we observ'd out of <HI>Bede</HI> of the <HI>Gentes Transmarinae</HI> beyond these two <HI>Firths,</HI> we will see clearly that these <HI>novae gentes</HI> were the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Pights;</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Country to∣wards the North-West, and the <HI>Pights</HI> in the Country North-East: but this is yet more confirmed by the account, that is given by <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the Action in the sixth Summer of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s Go∣vernment; <HI>Ampla civitate trans Bodotri∣am sita,</HI> being inform'd of a great peo∣ple, that dwelt beyond <HI>Forth;</HI> and <HI>civi∣tate</HI> being in the singular makes it to be understood of the people that lie near∣est, that is the <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>quia motus uni∣versarum ultra gentium &amp; infesta hostili exercitu itinera timebantur,</HI> because he apprehended that all the people beyond <HI>Forth</HI> would rise against him, and for
<PB N="164" REF="91"/>
that he feared that in his passage he might be attaqued by the Enemies Ar∣my, he tryed their Havens with his Fleet, where by the by there is a pret∣ty description of the nature and quality of the Country in these words <HI>ac mo∣do Sylvarum &amp; montium profunda, modo tempestatum ac fluctuum adversa, hinc terra &amp; hostis, hinc auctus oceanus mili∣tari Jactantia comparentur:</HI> Which ve∣ry well agreeth to the Woody and Mountainous Country mixed with Valleys that lieth to the North of this <HI>Firth</HI> and to the roughness of these <HI>Firths</HI> when agitated with winds, and a little below this he saith <HI>ad manus &amp; arma conversi Caledoniam incolentes populi,</HI> where he gives an account of a bloody Battle they had with the <HI>Romans</HI> where <HI>Agricola</HI> was put to it to make use of all his force and art.</P>
<P>What is meant by <HI>Caledonia,</HI> he has told us where he speaks of the figure of <HI>Britain,</HI> that what the Ancients said of it, agreed to that part upon this side of <HI>Caledonia; sed immensum &amp; enor∣me spatium procurrentium extremo jam littore terrarum, velut in cuneum tenua∣tur,</HI> by which he makes <HI>Caledonia</HI> to
<PB N="165" REF="91"/>
contain all the rest of <HI>Brittain,</HI> to the North of these <HI>Firths.</HI> And that they were different people that were posses∣sors of it, is clear by the words <HI>Cale∣doniam incolentes populi.</HI> By the <HI>Caledonij</HI> simply the <HI>Romans</HI> understood the <HI>Pights,</HI> that inhabited the countrey that lay upon the German Sea; but as he mentions several people here, so he gives you afterwards the <HI>Horesti,</HI> that is the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> the name of old given to the ancient <HI>Scots,</HI> and kept by their descendants even to this day. And after that he had given an account of the great preparations, he relates the battel he fought with these people the last summer of his Government, where he tells us that he marched up the <HI>Gram∣pian</HI> hills, where the Enemy were en∣camped on, and the way of their Figh∣ting, and the description he makes <HI>Galgacus</HI> their Commander in chief give of them, may clearly see that they were different People, and no other than those that <HI>Claudian</HI> and other Au∣thors call <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Pights.</HI></P>
<P>But because it is controverted by some late writers, whether they were Natives of <HI>Britain,</HI> or <HI>Irishes</HI> who from
<PB N="166" REF="92"/>
<HI>Ireland</HI> properly so called then invaded <HI>Britain,</HI> we shall bring some argu∣ments <HI>Tacitus</HI> furnishes us with, to prove that they were Natives of the <HI>British</HI> Soil; for in the account even in this last expedition, he says, <HI>Nam Britanni nihil fracti pugnae prioris even∣tu, &amp; ultionem aut servitium expectan∣tes, tandem{que} docti commune periculum concordia propulsandum legationibus &amp; foe∣deribus omnium civitatum vires excitave∣rant jam{que} supra trig inta millia armatorum aspiciebantur, &amp; adhuc affluebat omnis Juventus, &amp; quibus cruda &amp; viridis senectus, clari bello, ac sua quisque deco∣ra gestantes.</HI> Where it is observable that although he call'd them before <HI>novae gentes,</HI> yet here he calls them <HI>Bri∣tanni,</HI> which was the name the <HI>Ro∣mani</HI> gave to all that inhabited this <HI>Island,</HI> but it was never given by any of the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors to the inhabi∣tants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the words <HI>legationibus &amp; foederibus omnium civitatum vires ex∣civerant</HI> shows how the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Pights</HI> were united and composed one Army, for the <HI>Britons</HI> spoken of here are the inhabitants of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> and so it is that <HI>Tacitus</HI> says <HI>Galgacus</HI> designed them in these words <HI>Ostendamus, quos sibi Cale∣donia</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="92"/>
<HI>viros seposuerit.</HI> We find likewise in our Author, several marks of de∣stinction, first they are <HI>Gentes,</HI> now the Criticks have observ'd that <HI>Gens</HI> is a more general name, and so <HI>Universim Britanni Gens Britannorum appellantur; Natio</HI> is a particular people a part comprehended under the general name <HI>Gens:</HI> so the <HI>Caledonij,</HI> the <HI>Silures,</HI> and the rest mentioned by <HI>Ptolemee</HI> in his Map of <HI>Britain</HI> are <HI>nationes Britannicae.</HI> Our Author also speaks of <HI>Civitates</HI> which are not <HI>Towns,</HI> but <HI>Gentes, people,</HI> and the <HI>Clans</HI> that composed them, which lived under the command of their chiefs: so <HI>Galgacus</HI> is described here, <HI>inter plures duces virtute &amp; gene∣re praestans.</HI> And these same names we find in <HI>Ptolemee,</HI> are certainly the An∣cient names of the <HI>Clans;</HI> but <HI>Ptolemee</HI> has been deficient, in that he has not set down the general names, the peo∣ple designed themselves by, which in this part of the Island was <HI>Albanich</HI> and <HI>Peaghts,</HI> that is <HI>Albanenses</HI> and <HI>Picti,</HI> which two names prove them to be the ancient and first inhabitants of <HI>Britain,</HI> whom <HI>Caesar</HI> designs in these words, <HI>Interior pars ab ijs incolitur qui</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="93"/>
<HI>se natos in insula dicunt,</HI> which <HI>Galgacus</HI> owns here speaking to his Army, he calls them <HI>Nobilissimi totius Britanniae, eo{que} in ipsis penetralibus siti.</HI> It is worth the observing that that part of the Island which lay to the North of <HI>Hum∣ber,</HI> was by the confession of the learn∣edst of the <HI>British</HI> Historians (as <HI>pri∣ceus defen. hist. Britan. pag.</HI> 60. <HI>Ra∣nulph. Higden. polychronic. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Luddus Fragment.)</HI> called <HI>Albania,</HI> and a part of the country still carries the name of <HI>Broad Albine.</HI></P>
<P>And to clear that, the same people he designed <HI>Caledoniam incolentes populi,</HI> were the same called <HI>novae gentes,</HI> ap∣pears from this that follows, that when because of the summers being much spent, <HI>spargi bellum nequibat, in sines Ho∣restorum exercitum deducit,</HI> and a little after, <HI>ipse peditem at{que} equites lento itine∣re, quo novarum gentium animi ipsa tran∣sitûs mora terrerentur, in Hybernis loca∣vit;</HI> where they are called by the same name <HI>novae gentes,</HI> for <HI>Tacitus</HI> here re∣lates, that because the Summer was spent, and that the War could not be extended against the <HI>Pights</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> both, he marched with his to the
<PB N="169" REF="93"/>
borders of the <HI>Scots</HI> whom he calls <HI>Horesti,</HI> that is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Montani, Highlan∣ders,</HI> and indeed I have seen <HI>Roman</HI> Me∣dals that were found in <HI>Argileshire,</HI> and a great many have been found in se∣veral parts of <HI>Pearthshire,</HI> besides a great many <HI>Roman</HI> camps are still to be seen there. And in the Sixth year of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s Government, some of these camps had been attacqued, by some of those that dwelt in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> for he saith, <HI>Castella adorti metum ut provocan∣tes addiderant,</HI> and a little after it is said of these same people, <HI>Universi nonam legionem ut maxime invalidam nocte aggressi inter somnum ac trepidationem, caesis vigilijs irrupere jam{que} in ipsis castris pugnabant.</HI> This camp seems to be the very same which is yet extant near to <HI>Airdoch,</HI> and the reason I take it to have been one of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s camps is, for that our Author hath observed before, <HI>Adnotabant periti non alium ducem opportunitates locorum sapientius legisse, nullum ab Agricola positum castellum aut vi hostium expugnatum, aut pactione aut fuga desertum;</HI> for if we will consider this same Camp, we will find it has all the advantages, <HI>Vigetius de re militari</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="94"/>
<HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 22. saith a Camp should have <HI>Castella munienda sunt loco tuto, ubi &amp; lignorum, &amp; pabuli, &amp; aquae suppetit copia; &amp; si diutius commorandum sit, loci salu∣britas eligenda est, cavendum autem ne mons sit vicinus altior, qui ab adversa∣rijs captus possit officere; considerandum{que} ne torrentibus inundari consueverit campus.</HI> This is upon a heath in a slooping ground; it hath the water of <HI>Kneck</HI> run∣ning close by it, whose banks are so high, that it could not overflow, and there is wood near to it, and more has been about it, there is no Mountain nor considerable height so near, as that they could from thence annoy it. The same <HI>Vegetius</HI> adds, <HI>haec castella saepe stru∣cta instar oppidorum &amp; in finibus imperij, &amp; ubi perpetuae stationes &amp; praetenturae contra hostem;</HI> and the largeness of this Camp and its Situation upon the Fron∣teirs, makes this to be a <HI>Praetentu∣ra.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Praetorium,</HI> or the Generals quar∣ter is a large square, about a hundred paces every way, around it are five or six <HI>Aggeres</HI> or <HI>Dykes,</HI> and as many <HI>Valla</HI> or <HI>Ditches,</HI> the deepness of a mans height, there are Ports to the four quar∣ters
<PB N="171" REF="94"/>
of the World, and to the East there are several larger Squares, with their circumvallations continued for a good deal of way. To the West is the bank of the water of <HI>Kneck,</HI> and five or six miles to the North-East of this by the water of <HI>Earn</HI> near to <HI>Inch Pasery</HI> is a lesser camp, the <HI>Castrum ex∣ploratorum,</HI> the camp for the advance guard, and a little to the Eastward of this, beginneth the Roman <HI>via milita∣ris,</HI> called by the common people <HI>The street-way,</HI> this in some places is raised from the ground almost a man's height, and is so broad that Coaches may pass by other with ease upon it, and this runneth towards the River of <HI>Tay,</HI> the length of which <HI>Agricola</HI>'s devastations reached, as our Author <HI>Tacitus</HI> tell us. <HI>Tertius expeditionum annus novas gentes aperuit, vastatis us{que} ad Taum (aestuario nomen est) nationibus:</HI> And the <HI>Gram∣pian</HI> hills towards which he marched, when he fought the last Battle in the last year of his Government, <HI>ad montem Grampium pervenit, quem jam hostes in∣siderant,</HI> are but a few miles distant from these Camps.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="95"/>
There was a stone with this inscrip∣tion DIS MANIBUS AMMONIUS DAMIONIS COH I HISPANORUM STIPENDIORUM XXVII HERE∣DES F. C. lately taken up out of the <HI>Praetorium</HI> of the <HI>Praetentura,</HI> below which are some Caves, out of which some pieces of a Shield were taken up, and several Medals, have been taken up thereabouts. I have seen one in Sil∣ver of <HI>Antoninus pius</HI> found there. The people that live thereabouts, re∣port there was a large Roman Medal of Gold found there, and great quan∣tity of Silver ones have been found near to the water of <HI>Earn,</HI> amongst which I have seen some of <HI>Domitian,</HI> some of <HI>Trajan</HI> and some of <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> And whereas it is said, that this man for whom this Sepulcral inscription was made, was <HI>cohortis pri∣mae Hispanorum,</HI> if we will look to the <HI>notitia Imperij Romani</HI> we will find a∣mongst the Troops placed <HI>Secundum li∣neam valli,</HI> this <HI>cohors prima Hispanorum</HI> was one. And it would seem the Poet <HI>Claudian</HI> had this very same <HI>praetentura</HI> in his view in these Verses,</P>
<L><PB N="173" REF="95"/>
Venit &amp; extremis legio praetenta Britannis,</L>
<L>Quae Scoto dat fraena truci, &amp;c.</L>
<P>And so without all question the <HI>Glaci∣alis Ierne</HI> is means of this very Coun∣try, which had now the name of <HI>Stra∣thiern,</HI> where all these vestiges of the <HI>Roman</HI> exploits are found; and these called <HI>Scoti</HI> by <HI>Claudian,</HI> are the very same people <HI>Eumenius</HI> calleth <HI>Hyberni soli Britanni</HI> the Irish of the British Soil: and <HI>Tacitus</HI> calleth <HI>Horesti,</HI> High∣land men or <HI>Braemen,</HI> the name some of their descendants yet bear, while on the other side all Authors both ancient and modern agree, that the <HI>Romans</HI> were never in <HI>Ireland</HI> properly so cal∣led, and there are no <HI>Roman</HI> Camps, <HI>viae militares,</HI> nor <HI>Roman</HI> Coins to be found there.</P>
<P>It remaineth now that we show where the Country of the <HI>Pights</HI> was, who in the Verse last cited are joyned with the <HI>Scots</HI> and were not far from this same <HI>Praetentura,</HI> since the Poet imme∣diately subjoyns to</P>
<L>—Quae Scoto dat fraena truci</L>
<L>—Ferro{que} notatas,</L>
<L>Perlegit exanimes picto moriente figuras.</L>
<P><PB N="174" REF="96"/>
That this <HI>Thule</HI> was a part of <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> the Roman writers seem to be ve∣ry clear, especially <HI>Silius Italicus lib.</HI> 17. in these Verses,</P>
<L>Cerulus haud aliter cum dimicat incola Thules</L>
<L>Agmina falcifero circumvenit acta covino.</L>
<P>For <HI>Silius</HI> here seemeth to have in his view what <HI>Caesar</HI> in his Commentaries hath delivered of the <HI>Britons</HI> fighting in <HI>Essedis,</HI> and <HI>Pomponius Mela lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. where he speaks of the <HI>Britons</HI> saith <HI>Dimicant non equitatu modo, aut pedite, verum &amp; bigis &amp; curribus Gal∣lice armati covinos vocant, quorum falca∣tis axibus utuntur.</HI> And our Author <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells us, that in the Battle fought with our Countrymen at the <HI>Grampian</HI> hills, <HI>media covinarius &amp; eques strepitu ac discursu complebat;</HI> and a little below that, <HI>Covinarij peditum se praelio miscue∣re, &amp; quanquam recentem terrorem in∣tulerant, densis tamen hostium agminibus &amp; inaequalibus locis haerebant.</HI> These <HI>Co∣vinarij</HI> are called by <HI>Caesar, Essedarij,</HI> so I believe no Body will doubt but that <HI>Silius</HI> the <HI>Poet</HI> by <HI>Cerulus incola</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="96"/>
<HI>Thules</HI> meant the <HI>Britons.</HI> We also find an appellation of the same nature given to one of the Tribes of the <HI>Scots,</HI> by <HI>Seneca in ludo,</HI> in these Verses,</P>
<L>Ille Britannos</L>
<L>Ultra noti</L>
<L>Littora ponti</L>
<L>Et ceruleos</L>
<L>Scoto Brigantas</L>
<L>Dare Romuleis</L>
<L>Colla Catenis</L>
<L>Jussit.</L>
<P>For so it is read by <HI>Joseph Scaliger</HI> and by <HI>Salmasius, exercitat. Plini. in Solinum pag.</HI> 189. upon these words, <HI>Ge∣lones Agathirsi collimitantur cerulo picti: &amp; sane Pictos sive Agathirsos, haud ali∣ter interpretare liceat, quam aliquo colore fucatos, sic picti Scotobrigrantes Senecae, &amp; Picti, populi Britanniae ab eadem ratione dicti.</HI> And it would seem by these Ver∣ses,</P>
<L>Et ceruleos</L>
<L>Scoto Brigantas</L>
<L>Dare Romuleis</L>
<L>Colla catenis</L>
<L>Jussit.</L>
<P><PB N="176" REF="97"/>
That <HI>Seneca</HI> who was Contemporary with <HI>Claudius,</HI> had in his View the Victory which <HI>Ostorius</HI> under <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperour Governour of <HI>Britain</HI> ob∣tained over <HI>Caratacus</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> whose History may be seen elegantly done by <HI>Tacitus</HI> in the 12th Book of his <HI>Annals</HI> where he shews us that <HI>Ca∣ratacus</HI> being brought before <HI>Claudius</HI> in Chains, he made a brave discourse to him, and amongst other things tells him, <HI>ne{que} dedignatus esses, claris majoribus or∣tum, pluribus gentibus imperantem foedere pacis accipere;</HI> and without doubt be∣sides the <HI>Silures</HI> mentioned there by <HI>Ta∣citus,</HI> these <HI>Scoto-brigantes</HI> were of the number of these <HI>gentes</HI> he commanded. <HI>Claudius</HI> was so well pleased with his manly behaviour (saith <HI>Tacitus) Caesar veniam ipsi{que} &amp; conjugi &amp; fratribus tri∣buit, at{que} illi vinculis exsoluti,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to make it appear, which part of <HI>Britain</HI> the <HI>Thule</HI> mention'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> was, it will be fit to see to which part of <HI>Britain</HI> the Epithets at∣tributed by the Authors to <HI>Thule</HI> do a∣gree best. First then it was a remote part, <HI>Ultima Thule,</HI> as this is the remo∣test part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and as <HI>Tacitus</HI> bring∣eth
<PB N="177" REF="97"/>
in <HI>Galgacus</HI> expressing it, <HI>nos terra∣rum ac libertatis extremos recessus; ipse ac sinus famae in hunc diem defendit.</HI> Then <HI>Thule</HI> was towards the North, and so is this Country in respect of the <HI>Roman</HI> Province: And then thirdly it might deserve the name <HI>Thule,</HI> because of its obscure and dark aspect: it being then all overgrown with Woods. Fourthly the length of the day is attribute to <HI>Thule,</HI> and upon this Account it must be the Country to the North and to the East of <HI>Ierne</HI> by these Verses of <HI>Juve∣nal,</HI></P>
<L>—Arma quid ultra</L>
<L>Littora promovimus Juvernae &amp; modo cap∣tas</L>
<L>Orcades, &amp; minima contentos nocte Bri∣tannos.</L>
<P>For it is of the North and East parts of Britain the Panegyrist saith, <HI>Panegi∣ri Constantino Constantij filio Constantij dicti; O! fortunata &amp; nunc omnibus be∣atior terris Britannia.</HI> And a little below, <HI>Certe quod propter vitam diliguntur lon∣gissimi dies, &amp; nullae sine aliqua luce noctes, dum illa littorum extrema planities non at∣tollit umbras, noctis{que} metam coeli &amp; side∣rum</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="98"/>
<HI>transit aspectus, ut sol ipse qui nobi videtur occidere, ibi appareat praeterire,</HI> this same is applyed to the Northmost part of <HI>Britain</HI> by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> where he saith of it, <HI>Dierum spatia ultra nostri or∣bis mensuram, nox &amp; clara &amp; extrema Britanniae parte brevis ut sinem at{que} ini∣tium lucis exiguo discrimine internoscas, quod si nubes non officiant, aspici per noctem solis fulgorem nec occidere &amp; ex∣surgere, sed transire affirmant.</HI> And <HI>Lesly</HI> in his History observeth that in <HI>Ross</HI> and <HI>Cathnes</HI> the nights for two Months are so clear that one may read distinct∣ly. The like we have before observ'd of <HI>Orkney.</HI></P>
<P>Another property of <HI>Thule</HI> given by <HI>Tacitus</HI> is, that about it <HI>Mare pigrum &amp; grave remigantibus perhibent,</HI> which a∣greeth indeed to the Sea upon the North-East part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but not for the reason <HI>Tacitus</HI> gives, for want of Winds, but because of the contrary Tides, which drive several ways, and stop not only Boats with Oars, but Ships under sail that if any where it may be there said of the Sea,</P>
<L><PB N="179" REF="98"/>
Nunc spumis candentibus astra lacessit</L>
<L>Et nunc Tartareis subsidet in ima Bara∣thris.</L>
<P>But <HI>Thule</HI> is most expresly describ'd to be this very same Country we treat of by <HI>Conradus Celtes, itinere Bal∣tico,</HI></P>
<L>—Orcadibus qua cincta suis Tyle &amp; glaci∣alis Insula.</L>
<P>The same Epithet <HI>Claudian</HI> gives to <HI>Ierne</HI> where he calleth it <HI>Glaciales Ierne,</HI> and this <HI>Thule</HI> he makes to be encom∣passed <HI>suis Orcadibus,</HI> which Isles lie over∣against it; and a little after he gives the like Epithet to <HI>mare pigrum:</HI></P>
<L>Et jam sub septem spectant vaga rostra Triones</L>
<L>Qua Tyle est rigidis insula cincta vadis.</L>
<P>And afterwards he makes the <HI>Orcades</HI> to lie over-against this <HI>Thule,</HI> and seems to have in his view the Rocks and Weels in <HI>Pightland Firth</HI> in these Lines,</P>
<L><PB N="180" REF="99"/>
Est locus Arctoo qua se Germania tractu,</L>
<L>Claudit, &amp; in rigidis Tyli ubi surgit a∣quis,</L>
<L>Quam juxta infames scopuli &amp; petrosa vo∣rago</L>
<L>Asperat undisonis saxa pudenda vadis,</L>
<L>Orcades has memorant dictas a nomine Graeco.</L>
<P>By all which I think it appeareth suf∣ficiently that the North-East part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which <HI>Severus</HI> the Emperor and <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Great infested with their Armies, and in which as <HI>Boethius</HI> observes <HI>Roman</HI> Medals were found, is undoubtedly the <HI>Thule</HI> mention'd by the Roman writers, and which if we will believe the learned <HI>Angrimus Ionas, Specimen Island. Hist.</HI> was meant by <HI>Pto∣lemee,</HI> where he saith, <HI>ubi nec omitten∣dum; quod parallelo</HI> xxi <HI>per Thulen ducto ab ipso Ptolemaeo, latitudo respondeat</HI> 55 <HI>gr. &amp;</HI> 36. So that our Country in these ancient times past under the name of <HI>Hybernia</HI> and <HI>Thule,</HI> and the <HI>Hyberni</HI> and <HI>Picti Incolae Thules,</HI> are the same people who were afterwards called <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="99"/>
It seems indeed the name <HI>Scot</HI> at first was only proper to some tribes of those people who called them∣selves <HI>Albanich,</HI> such as the <HI>Scoto. Brigantes</HI> mentioned by <HI>Seneca,</HI> and the <HI>Scottodeni</HI> in <HI>Ptolemee,</HI> which by the corruption of the copies is now read <HI>Ottodeni;</HI> but they it seems were ne∣ver called <HI>Scots</HI> generally, nor their countrey <HI>Scotia,</HI> till after <HI>Keneth</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who sub∣dued the <HI>Pights</HI> and incorporated them into one nation with our Ancestors. Yet <HI>Wernerus Ralwingius, fasciculo temp.</HI> saith, <HI>edente Lino papa, Scotica gens o∣ritur ex Pictis &amp; Hybernis in Albania, quae est pars Angliae;</HI> which confirms very much what we have been pro∣ving all along, but makes the name to have been used generally sooner than it appeareth to us from our Hi∣storians.</P>
<P>I shall only add one remark more, and that is, that we need not have recourse, for the rise of the name <HI>Scot,</HI> to the fabulous account of the Monks, who will needs have it from one <HI>Scota, Pharaoh</HI>'s daughter married to <HI>Gathalus;</HI> since without that strain, if it be granted that the Country was
<PB N="182" REF="100"/>
once call'd <HI>Thule,</HI> which in the <HI>Phoe∣nician</HI> language signifies darkness; we have a very clear reason for the name <HI>Scotia,</HI> which signifieth the same in the Greek tongue, and it is very well known that it was usual with the Greeks (who next to the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were the Famousest Navigators) not only to retain the <HI>Phoenician</HI> name of the place, but likewise to give one in their own Language of the same im∣port: And since the learned <HI>Brochar∣tus</HI> has very ingeniously deduced the <HI>Greek</HI> name of the whole Island <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from <HI>Barat anac</HI> and <HI>Brata∣nack</HI> in the <HI>Phoenician</HI> tongue, which signifies <HI>a Land of Tinn,</HI> which the <HI>Greeks</HI> not only inflected to their own termination, but likewise call'd the British Isles <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that is <HI>Lands of Tinn,</HI> which is the signification of the <HI>Phoenician</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> names; we make take the same liberty to derive the <HI>Greek</HI> name <HI>Scotia</HI> from the <HI>Phoe∣nician Thule.</HI></P>
