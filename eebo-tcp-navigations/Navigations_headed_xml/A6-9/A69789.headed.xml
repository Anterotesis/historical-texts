D<SUP>R</SUP>. <HI>CONNOR'<SUP>S</SUP></HI> PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my PREFACE to the First Volume of this <HI>Historical Rela∣tion of POLAND,</HI> I have men∣tion'd my Incapacity for Matters of this Nature; both because I was only Twelve Months in that Kingdom, and because I have no Talent, or Genius, for History. I thought, Writing it by way of LET∣TERS, in Imitation of some of our Neighbours, would be more easie to my self, and more acceptable to the Pub∣lick. I am proud to have this happy Occasion of giving the Honourable Per∣sons I write to so publick a Testimony of my Respects. I am sorry in the same time, I cannot have Leisure to honour my self in writing to the Noble Persons men∣tion'd
<PB REF="3"/>
in the Second Volume, as I have had in the First. I follow a Profession so remote from HISTORY, particu∣larly a <HI>Polish</HI> one, that it neither allows me Time, nor leaves me any Inclination to attend any other Business. I hope notwithstanding, the Persons I promis'd to write to, will be pleas'd to excuse me for not being able to keep my Word to them, as I flatter'd my self I could, since the ingenious Gentleman I desir'd to undertake this Work will give them the same Satisfaction, he having already as∣sisted me in my First Volume, and ha∣ving had all my Memoirs for this Se∣cond.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Form of the Government in <HI>Poland,</HI> and of the King's Power, Court, and Revenues.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT high Station wherewith the King has Recompenc'd Your Merits, and the great Trust His Majesty has reposed in Your <HI>GRACE</HI> during his Absence, shews his Confidence in Your Ability, as well
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
to Govern the <HI>State</HI> as the Church. Since therefore being lately Invested with a share of the Regal Authority, you had occasion to know more intimately Our King's Power and Prerogatives, I thought my self oblig'd to give Your <HI>GRACE</HI> an Account of those of the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> to the end, that compa∣ring both together, you might more sensibly perceive the Excellency of our Own Consti∣tution, which makes the Greatness of the King inseparable from the Interest of the People: For when the Executive Power is as vigilant to see our Laws obey'd, as the Le∣gislative has been provident in making them, <HI>England</HI> can justly boast of a much greater Happiness, than either <HI>Poland</HI> or any other Kingdom of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From the Year <HI>550,</HI> to the Year <HI>1698.</HI></NOTE> Having, <HI>My LORD,</HI> not been a full Twelve Month at the late King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Court, I cannot pretend to be throughly ac∣quainted with that Kingdom; yet I find that, like most other Countries, it has undergone several Changes in its Constitution since the middle of the VIth Century (at which time it began to be a distinct Nation) during the Reigns of the two great Houses of <HI>Piastus</HI> and <HI>Jagello.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Former Power of the Kings of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> Ever since the time of <HI>Lechus</HI> its Foun∣der, the Kings thereof have been Elected to the Crown after an Hereditary manner, tho' not by an Hereditary Title: They have re∣ally been Absolute, and their Will went for a Law; for then they made Peace and War when they pleas'd, Levied as many Troops as they thought fit, Punish'd or Pardon'd at
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Pleasure, and Rewarded where they saw Con∣venient: And all the Administration, either of Public or Private Affairs was so wholly lodg'd in the King's Hands, that I have heard the <HI>Poles</HI> themselves say, That <HI>Sigismund</HI> II. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1574.</NOTE>the last King of the <HI>Jagellonic</HI> Family, was to the full as Absolute as either the King of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Denmark</HI> is now.</P>
<P>Whilst the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> thus maintain∣ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantage thereby.</NOTE>a Supream Power over their Subjects, they exceedingly enlarged their Dominions, were both fear'd Abroad, and belov'd at Home, Commanded Potent and Numerous Armies into the Field, Executed most Enterprizes speedily, and were almost always sure of Suc∣cess; and this because they did not then, as now, depend upon the lingering Determina∣tion, and tedious Conclusions of a Turbulent <HI>Diet.</HI> But the Family of <HI>Jagello</HI> being once Extinct, by the Death of <HI>Sigismund</HI> II. who had resign'd his Kingdom to the Senate and <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry, and given them full Power and Authority to dispose thereof as they thought fit, the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> was anew declared <HI>Elective,</HI> to the end that all the Princes of <HI>Christendom,</HI> who had due Merits and Quali∣fications, might have a Right to Aspire there∣unto.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Prin∣ces Court the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry.</NOTE> This gave occasion to most of the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> ever since, to Court the <HI>Polish</HI> No∣bility after their King's Death: And that ei∣ther to get the succeeding Election deter∣mined in their own Favour, or else to have some of their Friends Advanced to that great Dignity; but this most commonly rather with regard to their own private Interests,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
than out of any Respect to the Person they desired to Promote; as the Houses of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Bourbon</HI> have always practis'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nobilities Resolves thereupon,</NOTE> The Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> therefore observing that several Princes at a time always Aspir'd to their Crown, and considering that not one of them had more Right than the rest; as like∣wise that it lay altogether in their Power to choose whom they pleased, resolved Unani∣mously to Elect none but such as should Con∣descend, nay Swear, to observe the Terms and Conditions they proposed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abridge the Antient Power of their Prin∣ces,</NOTE> Hereby the <HI>Poles</HI> by degrees have clip'd and limited the Antient Power of their Kings, and have reduc'd them to the Bounds we now find them to have, that is, barely to a third Part of the Grand <HI>Diet:</HI> For the <HI>Poles</HI> knew very well, that no Prince would be so Impru∣dent as to scruple Submitting to any Condi∣tions, to become Master of so considerable a Kingdom, to which he had no Right either by Birth or other Claim; and more especial∣ly since these Conditions are neither Rigorous nor Dishonourable, but such as are decently consistent with the Regal Character he is to be Invested with.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And Consti∣tute a Re∣public.</NOTE> Thus the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry, of a kind of Mo∣narchical Government, have in time made a perfect <HI>Republic,</HI> consisting of three Orders; The King, Senate, and Gentry; which they call the Nobility.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the People of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> Here, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I must take notice to Your GRACE, that the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation is divided into two sorts of People, the Gentry or Freeborn Subjects, who are hardly a Tenth Part of the Kingdom, and the Vassals, who
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
are no better than Slaves to the Gentry, for they have no Benefit of the Laws, can Buy no Estates, nor Enjoy any Property no more than our <HI>Negroes</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> can and this because some Ages since the Com∣mon People Revolting against their Lords, and having driven them out of the Nation, the Gentry came with a Foreign Power, and reduced them to a greater Subjection than be∣fore, in which they have been kept ever since. So that the Government of <HI>Poland</HI> at present comprehends only the King and Gen∣try. By a Gentleman or Nobleman of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> is understood a Person who either him∣self, or his Family, has a Possession in Land: For they never Intermarry with the Common People. All the Gentry from the King's Sons to those that are but only Masters of an Acre of Land, are equally Noble, both by their Birth and the Constitution of the Kingdom; for no Body is Born either a Palatine, <HI>Senator,</HI> or Lord, but those Titles are always annex∣ed to certain Employments, which the King only gives to Persons advanced in Age, and recommended by their Merits.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diet.</NOTE> The <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> (in some respects) re∣sembles our Parliament, being made up of two Houses; the House of <HI>Senators,</HI> answerable to our House of Lords; and the House of <HI>Nuncio</HI>'s, not unlike our House of Commons. The <HI>Senators</HI> are the Bishops, <HI>Palatines, Ca∣stellans,</HI> and the Ten Great Officers of the Crown, in all about 142. In the Upper-House the <HI>Senators</HI> sit not by any Writ of Summons or Letters Patents as in <HI>England,</HI> but only by Virtue of the Great Preferments in
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
the King's Gift, which they Enjoy for Life. So that the King wholly Constitutes the Upper House; but the Lower are the Representatives of the Gentry, Elected by them alone in their respective Provinces, without the Concur∣rence of the Common People, who have no Priviledge to Vote in their Election. Inso∣much, that at least Nine Parts in Ten of the People of <HI>Poland</HI> are excluded from having any Share in the Government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Power.</NOTE> The Grand <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> is nothing else but the King, <HI>Senators,</HI> and Deputies assem∣bled together in any Part of the Kingdom that his Majesty Commands. Without this great Assembly of the <HI>States,</HI> the King can neither Make nor Repeal Laws, Declare War nor Conclude a Peace, make no Alliance with any Foreign Princes, raise neither Troops nor Taxes, Coin no Money; and, in a word, can Determine no Matter of State of any Impor∣tance, without the Universal Consent and Concurrence of this Parliament, which they term the <HI>Free States of</HI> Poland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives for a mixt Go∣vernment.</NOTE> Several powerful Motives have enclin'd the <HI>Poles</HI> to Establish this kind of mixt Government, which they take to be a just Temperament of whatever is to be found most Excellent in the several Monarchies, <HI>Aristocracies,</HI> and <HI>De∣mocracies,</HI> that have been in the World. The most considerable of which Motives, as I have met with them in their Histories, or learn'd them from the most knowing among their Natives, are as follows.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Motive.</NOTE> First, They think by this Judicious Choice of a Government, to preserve their King∣dom from those Disorders which most com∣monly
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
attend Absolute Monarchies: Agree∣ing herein with that Prince of Philosophers, <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who though he preferr'd this kind of Government to all Others, yet was he ne∣vertheless obliged to own, that when ever it degenerated, it was the most pernicious of all.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Poles</HI> have temper'd the Exorbi∣tant Power of their Kings, with the mixture of two other Governments, whereby they thought to secure their Liberty, a Thing al∣ways most Dear to them, from the Arbitrary Will of a Prince, who by Imagining him∣self above the Laws, might Fancy whatever his Passions prompted him to, allowable, and his truest Interest to be the Entire Subjection of his People. The miserable Examples of their Neighbours, the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moscovites,</HI> have sufficiently convinced them of this Truth; wherefore the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation thought it but convenient to limit the excessive Power of their Kings, and confine them to Rule with more Moderation and Ju∣stice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. Motive.</NOTE> Secondly, The <HI>Poles</HI> have observ'd as well from their own Government, as from that of their Neighbours, that no small disad∣vantage has flow'd from an <HI>Aristocracy.</HI> They could not be perswaded but that the Autho∣rity of one Person was infinitely more easie to be Tolerated than that of many; for that either the Ambition or Jealousy of such would often disturb the Repose and Tranquility of the Public. <HI>Poland</HI> also began to Reflect up∣on its former Miseries under its <HI>Woievods,</HI> when it was deplorably rent and torn by the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Factions among those Palatines: Insomuch that even while it became a Conqueror from without, it was vanquish'd within, and that by its own Force. This gave the <HI>Poles</HI> no small dislike to an <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> which they have resolved never more to admit among them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">III. Motive.</NOTE> The Third Reason of State, which has ob∣liged the <HI>Poles</HI> to reject a <HI>Democracy,</HI> is, that they look upon that sort of Government to be the most dangerous of all, being the easiest enflam'd, and the greatest Enemy to true Nobility. Its first <HI>Maxim</HI> is, <HI>To procure a Ʋniversal Levelling, or making all alike;</HI> where∣by, under the Notion of a common Liberty, they weaken and enervate those great Geni∣us's which were design'd to Govern and Pro∣tect them. How then could it be expected that the Descendents of those mighty War∣riers who Founded the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation, and have so long maintain'd the Honour of it by their Valour, should submit to have their Blood debased, by mixing it with the Ignoble Vul∣gar?</P>
<P>The Tyranny of Laws, which the Nobles are subjected to in an Absolute Common∣wealth, would be too rude a Check to this Ambition which the <HI>Poles</HI> have always had to Command over their Vassals, and therefore they have always entertain'd a secret <HI>Odium</HI> for those <HI>Grecian</HI> Republics, that Banish'd their greatest Statesmen, meerly because they would not have them gain too fast upon the Affections of the People.</P>
<P>If any should perhaps doubt of the perni∣cious Consequences of a popular Government,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
where Reason does not so much reign as an Unruly violence of a People, who know no other Laws than those of their Passions; let them cast their Eyes on the Heats of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire, who were often ready to Over∣turn the State, had not the Senate speedily applied a prudent Remedy. But there are o∣ther Examples more Modern, as the Revolt of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and the last Troubles in <HI>Bo∣hemia.</HI> To these also may be added the Re∣volutions of our own Nation in the Time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. when the Fury of the People ex∣tended their Rage, even to the dipping their Hands in this Prince's Blood.</P>
<P>Politicians do generally own, that the People are a wild Beast, which ought rather to be led than left at Liberty, and by con∣sequence have pronounced it most Perilous to acquiesce under their Subjection. An <HI>A∣narchy</HI> would undoubtedly do more harm in a day, than a Tyrant could in all his Reign. If he Punishes, 'tis with some pre∣tence of Justice, when nothing can abate the Peoples Rage, but an utter Extinction of whatever is placed over their He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds.</P>
<P>A mixt Government therefore made out of all these Three, is that which has proved most <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advan∣tage of a mixt Go∣vernment.</NOTE>Agreeable to the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation, being a just <HI>Medium</HI> between the dangerous Extremities of an Absolute Monarchy, and those of <HI>Aristo∣cracy</HI> and <HI>Democracy.</HI> It is this the <HI>Poles</HI> have pitch'd upon as most proper to preserve the public Liberty, and to perpetuate the Happi∣ness of their State; being, it seems, perswa∣ded that a Body Politic resembles a Humane in this, that as the one borrows all its Vigour
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
and Health from a Just Temperament of the different Humours that compose it; so the other depends absolutely on that of the Three before-mention'd Forms of Government. And moreover, as the former subsists by the mutual Opposition of contrary Qualities, so the King, Senate and Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> having in some measure different Interests and Incli∣nations, are not only hinder'd from deviating into vicious Extremities, but also through a Noble Emulation are excited to labour care∣fully for the Good of the Public.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the Repub∣lic.</NOTE> The Republic is divided into Two <HI>States,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania;</HI> yet both which are but as one Body, having the same King, the same Par∣liament, the same Laws, the same Privileges, the same Religion, and, as the natural result of all these, the same Interest. These Two States are so very well United, that a King cannot be Elected, a Law made, nor any State-Business done, without the mutual Con∣sent of both. But, <HI>My Lord,</HI> as the King is the Prime and Chief Member of this Re∣public, I will give Your <HI>GRACE</HI> an Account of his present Power and Prerogatives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings pre∣sent Power and Prero∣gatives.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> are too proud a Nation to agree with those Politicians that measure the Gran∣deur of a Prince, and Happiness of a <HI>State,</HI> by the Despotic Power of him that Governs it; and therefore those pernicious Maxims of Tyrants, <HI>Si Lubet, Licet; Oderint dum Me∣tuant,</HI> and the like, would be but ill receiv'd among a People that have all along secured their Liberties by their Prudence and Valour.
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
This Vassalage would suit well enough with the Slaves of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> or with the <HI>Moscovites</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who all suffer them∣selves to be govern'd like Beasts, and led by the Nose according to the different Caprice or Pleasure of their Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Happi∣ness.</NOTE> As for the Kings of <HI>Poland,</HI> they may rest in security in the Bosom of their Country, even amidst the Noise of Arms, either with∣out or within their Dominions, since they have always their Subjects to crowd about them for their Guards, thro' indispensable Inclinations. For what contributes chiefly to the Happiness of these Princes, is, the Loyal Observance and voluntary Obedience paid them even by those that are at Liberty to do the contrary. I have often heard Monsieur <HI>de Polignac,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, say at <HI>Warsaw, That he thought a King of</HI> Poland <HI>more Happy in his Person and Condition, than a King of</HI> France. Nevertheless this Authority of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> is so alloy'd by the Laws of the Land, that it does not exact more Vene∣ration from the Nobles or Gentry, than they think he deserves: For tho' their Behaviour be generally extraordinary Observant, yet do they tacitly seem to call in question the Power they have limited, and often refuse that Duty which they have deem'd him wor∣thy of by his Election.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unhappi∣ness.</NOTE> The <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility make no Difference between their King's Right, and those of the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>Deputies,</HI> affirming, That since these three Members compose but one Body, they ought equally to share in the same Bene∣fits and Injuries, and consequently ought all
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
either to Reward the one, or Revenge the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Inconveni∣ence to the State.</NOTE> The small Authority therefore of their Kings, and the Impossibility of their Acting by themselves, has at all times exposed <HI>Po∣land</HI> to the Insults of their Neighbours, and the Rage of their own People, as may be seen in the Civil Wars of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and the Treachery and Sedition of the Confederates which could never have arriv'd at so great height, if the King had had but sufficient Power to have suppress'd them. Also the Great Marshal of the Crown <HI>Lubomirski,</HI> would never have had the Boldness to have op∣pos'd King <HI>Casimir</HI>'s Designs openly, and to have form'd so many Factions against the Court, had he not had some Assurances of re∣maining Unpunish'd. This makes the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to be stiled a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, since he has no better than Companions and Equals for his Subjects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Instances of <HI>Poles</HI> Af∣fections to their Kings.</NOTE> We have divers Instances of the <HI>Poles</HI> love for their Kings, and particularly by their once enforcing the Right of <HI>Sigismund</HI> III. to the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden,</HI> in an obstinate War which they began several times, as likewise in supporting afterwards the Pretences of <HI>Ʋla∣dislaus</HI> VII. to <HI>Moscovy:</HI> To omit divers o∣thers of a more ancient Date. This Respect of their obliges them frequently to come and spend their Estates at Court, thinking to aug∣ment their Princes Grandeur by their Prodi∣gality and Magnificence. This appears by the mistake made by <HI>Gregory</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> at the Interview between him and <HI>Casimir</HI> the Great, at <HI>Glogan,</HI> (which Place the former

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Modern Kings Pow∣er.</NOTE> The Custom and Inclination of the <HI>Poles</HI> runs so strong towards Honouring their Prince, that all they have, or are able to do, even to the Destruction of their Lives and Fortunes, they are willing to lavish in his Ser∣vice, without expecting any greater Recom∣pence than the Glory of Waiting on His Ma∣jesty's Person. Insomuch, that a King of <HI>Poland</HI> who is Couragious and Prudent, Just and Sober, Liberal and Religious; one that observes the Laws and Constitutions of his Kingdom, and in a word, who has no other Interest but the Common Good and Safety of his Subjects, is as much Respected and Ho∣nour'd, and as faithfully Obey'd both in time of Peace and War; nay, as formidable to all his Enemies as most Princes in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>As to what relates to War, no Monarch has greater Advantages than himself; for he is neither at the trouble of raising Forces nor Expence in Maintaining them; his Business being only to convene the <HI>Diet,</HI> and they do all these things to his Hand. After War is once declar'd, he can continue the same, either by himself or his Generals, can Regulate his Troops, and see his Army duly paid out of the Treasury of the Republic. He has a great deal of reason to hope for Success in his Ex∣peditions, because that not having under∣taken them on his own account, those that engag'd him to them will infallibly support him in them, and the rather, by reason that
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
what was done was altogether with their Consent. This has prov'd the Cause of al∣most neverfailing Success to the <HI>Polish</HI> Arms till of late Days, the King and his Subjects not having been in so good Intelligence with each other as formerly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abroad and at Home.</NOTE> When the King is in the Army in Person, he has the Supreme Authority there, gives Battle when he pleases, and Besieges Towns as often as he thinks fit: And likewise Com∣mands absolutely all the Gentry to follow him into the Field on Horseback at ever so little warning. At Home he has the free Nomina∣tion of all Ecclesiastical Benefices, and of all Se∣cular Employments, as well Military as Civil throughout the whole Extent of his Domini∣ons; without speaking of a great number of Royal <HI>Demesnes,</HI> which together with the State-Dignities he confers on those that have deserv'd them. He can bestow as considerable Preferments as any Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> and ob∣lige and raise the Fortune of whom he pleases. He has his Vote in Naming Cardinals, as well as other Roman Catholic Kings have. He can send and receive Ambassadors pri∣vately in Matters relating only to himself, but as to what concerns the Republic the Se∣nate must have their Share in it. He can Call, Prorogue, and Dissolve the <HI>Diet</HI> at Pleasure. In a word, the <HI>Poles</HI> term him, <HI>The Protector of their Laws and Privileges; The Distributor of Honours; The Supream Head of their Re∣public; and Supream General of their Forces.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Respect paid him.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> attend his Person Uncover'd: The Chief Senators generally Serve him at Table, first tasting of the Cup before they

His Subjects never sit before him, nor cover their Heads any where but in the <HI>Diet,</HI> and there too the Senators are only allow'd that Liberty, for the <HI>Depu∣ties</HI> stand behind with their Furr'd Caps in their Hands. The late King <HI>John Sobieski</HI> din'd always in Public, and I never saw any sit down with him at Table when he eat at Court, except the Queen, his Children and foreign Ministers: Yet when he either Hunt∣ed or Travell'd, I have known some private Gentlemen to have had that Honour: Nay even his own Servants that waited on him were then admitted to eat with him. This his Majesty knew was absolutely necessary for him to allow of, since by refusing any this Favour, he might incur the Displeasure and Hatred of the whole <HI>Noblesse.</HI> This was verifi∣ed in the Case of <HI>Sigismund</HI> of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who for having refused the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry to eat with him, was utterly excluded from the Crown that had been design'd him by <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> his Father in Law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Titles and other Preroga∣tives.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> when they speak to their King, call him, <HI>Mosci Krullo,</HI> or <HI>Milociwy Krullo,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>Merciful King.</HI> The Titles Ambassadors give him, or which are commonly made use of in Acts of Parliament, or other Instruments sign'd by him and made in his Name, are these; <HI>Fre∣deric Augustus</HI> II. <HI>King of Poland, Great Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Russia, Prussia, Maso∣via, Samogitia, Kiovia, Volhynia, Podolia, Pod∣lachia, Livonia, Smolensko, Severia,</HI> and <HI>Czer∣nikovia.</HI> All sorts of Gold, Silver, or Brass Coins are Stamp'd with his Image and Name.

He gets be∣sides vast Sums of Money for Nominations Employments, of which the late King did not scruple to sell, though 'twas directly con∣trary to the Constitutions of the Kingdom. Nay, the Ecclesiastical Benefices which are so very considerable, have been put under Con∣tribution by some cunning Artifice or other, as happen'd some Years since about the Na∣ming of a Bishop of <HI>Cracow,</HI> whose Bishoprick is worth Eight Thousand Pounds Sterling <HI>per Annum,</HI> which will go further than Twenty Thousand Pounds in <HI>England.</HI> There were several that Aspir'd a long while to this Va∣cant

Dignity, and every one solicited what Friends he had at Court for the obtaining of it, but most applied themselves to the Queen, and begg'd of her (though she has no Authority of her own) to Intercede to the King in their Behalf. After a long Debate the Queen call'd the Abbot <HI>Malakowski</HI> aside (who was one of the Competitors, and a rich Man) and told him, <HI>That tho' there were several that aimed at that Bishoprick, yet she would Wager Fifty Thousand Crowns that he was pre∣fer'd to them all.</HI> Whereupon the good Abbot thinking to venture nothing, being sure that either he should be Bishop, or should gain a considerable Sum, readily lays down the Money, and by way of an accidental Bargain, bought very dear his Bishoprick.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Late King's great Rich∣es.</NOTE> It has been Calculated, that the late King, what by his Own Incomes, Pensions allow'd him from the Crown, and other Casualties, was worth about Three hundred thousand Pounds Sterling a Year, of which he did not spend much above one Hundred thousand, ha∣ving had no Soldiers nor Army to Pay, or Maintain, but only his Guards and his Court. He hoarded up the greatest part of the Mo∣ney in the Kingdom, and was reputed to have had as much ready Cash by him, as any Prince in <HI>Europe;</HI> all which nevertheless the <HI>Poles</HI> Vow'd they would have back again, when his Sons bought their Votes to be King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crown Revenues.</NOTE> The Kings Crown-Revenues are Imposts upon Merchandizes, and upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> part of the Customs of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and the Reve∣nues of the Salt Mines of <HI>Cracow</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="12"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queens Re∣venues.</NOTE> The Queen's Revenue consists either in a Gift from the King her Husband, out of the Royal Revenues, with Consent of the States; or in an Annual Pension allow'd her by the Republick. The Gift from her Husband serves also for her <HI>Dower,</HI> and is called by the <HI>Poles</HI> what amounts to the Sense of the word <HI>Reformation,</HI> being the Reversion only of a certain number of <HI>Starostaships</HI> after the Death of those that Enjoy them. If the King chance to die before the Queen has this <HI>Reformation</HI> assign'd her, then the Republic gives her a Yearly Pension out of the Crown-Revenues, but this no longer than she conti∣nues unmarried, or stays in the Realm, for otherwise in both those Cases the Queen Re∣gent gets it, or else it reverts to the State. It may be observ'd, that the Queen Regent never comes by it without the Consent of the <HI>Diet,</HI> and that is no ordinary Expence to her to procure, by Purchasing almost all the Votes of that Mercenary Assembly. This may be seen in the Case of the present Queen-Dow∣ager; for when the Queen her Predecessor Marry'd the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> she, observing that the Settlement of her Pension was like to be put off to the succeeding <HI>Diet,</HI> which is conven'd only once in three Years, thought it better to be at the Charge of gaining their Votes at that Session, than to lose three Years Income. This Revenue is generally compu∣ted at half a Million <HI>Polish,</HI> which amounts to about Thirty Thousand <HI>English</HI> Pounds. As long as the Queen-Dowager enjoys this Pen∣sion, the Queen-Regent can have none; for the <HI>Poles</HI> say, that it would be too much to Pension two Queens at once.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Power li∣mited in several re∣spects.</NOTE> Tho' the King of <HI>Poland</HI> has many impor∣tant Employments to distribute, yet his Power is always limited in the Distribution of them; for he cannot Name any of his Children, no nor so much as the Queen, to any Charge either Ecclesiastical or Temporal. <HI>Sigismund</HI> III. having a mind to give his Queen <HI>Constantia</HI> two <HI>Starostaships,</HI> vacant by the Death of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> who died in the Year 1625. all the Gentry oppos'd it by a great Uproar in the <HI>Diet,</HI> and maintain'd vi∣gorously, That a King of <HI>Poland</HI> ought not to part with any Office without their Con∣sent. Neither can he Purchase any Lands for them in any part of the Kingdom, without Consent of the <HI>Diet;</HI> Although the late King bought several vast Territories in other Peo∣ples Names, both in <HI>Russia, Prussia,</HI> and al∣most all over the Kingdom; and besides pur∣chas'd a Principality of the Emperor in <HI>Si∣lesia,</HI> for Prince <HI>James</HI> his Eldest Son. But the <HI>Poles</HI> having long since discovered the Secret, pretended, when I was at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> that all those Lands must come to the Crown after the King's Death. Some of the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> also have been so kind as to part with their Prerogatives in Ecclesiastical Mat∣ters, so that now they retain only the Colla∣tion of Benefices. As for the Foundation of Monasteries whatever Power the King may have left to Erect them, they must always be confirm'd by the Three <HI>Orders</HI> of the <HI>States.</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> is likewise limited in divers other respects, for he can neither en∣crease nor diminish the Number of Officers either of his Court or the Kingdom, nor Name
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
any Stranger, that is not Naturaliz'd, to any Charge or Government; only in the Foot Army, and there too such a Person can pre∣tend to no more than to be a Captain, or at most a Colonel. This may appear by the Ex∣ample of <HI>Stephen Batori,</HI> who having had con∣siderable Services done him by the <HI>Hungari∣ans</HI> in the War against the <HI>Moscovites,</HI> he thought it but reasonable to Prefer some of them for Recompence, which extreamly in∣cens'd the <HI>Poles,</HI> and particularly the Grand General so much, that he immediately there∣upon resign'd his Staff. 'Tis also out of the Kings Power to advance some Natives; for all Citizens, Merchants, Tradesmen and their Sons, Country-Men, Labourers, and gene∣rally all Artificers, are not only by the Con∣stitutions of the Kingdom excluded from Pre∣ferments, which the King has the Nomina∣tion of, but also have not Liberty either of Buying or Enjoying Lands or Estates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nobility only capa∣ble of Pre∣ferment.</NOTE> 'Tis then the Nobility alone, or Freeborn of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> or of the other Provinces In∣corporated into that Monarchy, that can pre∣tend to any Preferment in the Republic: Wherefore the aforesaid King <HI>Batori</HI> think∣ing to Advance his Nephews, by reason he had no Children, design'd to get them Naturalized in the <HI>Diet</HI> held the Thir∣teenth of <HI>December</HI> 1586▪ but was pre∣vented by Death. It must withal be un∣derstood, that 'tis not every one of these that can Aspire or lay Claim to every Preferment, but only such as have Lands or Estates in the Kingdom, the Great Dutchy, or any other
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
Incorporated Province where the Preferment lies. For a Free-born Native of the King∣dom, though he has an Estate in it, yet can∣not be a Governor of a City in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> nor have any kind of Employment there, without a setled Estate in that Country. But the Ad∣vantage that all Freeborn Natives have, is, that they can Buy an Estate throughout the whole Extent of the Dominions of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Li∣mitations of the Kings Power.</NOTE> There is another Inconvenience which very much Prejudices and Limits the King's Power, and the public Interest of the whole Com∣monwealth; for where-ever a Noble <HI>Pole</HI> is once named to a Preferment, and is in actu∣al possession of it, let him commit never so many Crimes against the Crown or State, he can never be depriv'd of his Employ, or turn'd out of it without the Unanimous Consent of the <HI>Diet,</HI> but shall continue in▪ the same for Life, even against a the Will of the <HI>Diet,</HI> if he has but one Member on his Side, who will protest against the Proceedings. For the Negative Voice of a Member of the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> has the same Force with a Negative of a King of <HI>England</HI> in Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inconveni∣ences there∣by.</NOTE> This pernicious Constitution occasions ma∣ny Troubles and Animosities, for it encou∣rages Unruly and Mutinous People to disturb the Commonwealth. Officers never serve the Republic faithfully; Treasurers arè thereby emboldened to give no Account of the Public Revenues; the Generals of the Army, and Governors of Provinces and Towns, do as they think fit, and most commonly mind their own private Affairs more than the Inte∣rest
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
of the Republic. In a word, though the <HI>Poles</HI> term this Constitution the greatest Mark of their Liberty, it inevitably Ruins the Foundation of the whole State, and every one sees what bad Consequences must and do ne∣cessarily follow from this excessive Liberty, or rather Libertinism of every Private Officer of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why he is paid so great Re∣spect.</NOTE> <HI>My Lord,</HI> This great Privilege of the Of∣cers, makes them pay more than ordinary Respect to the King, before they are Digni∣fy'd, and court him to give them a Charge which he can never afterwards take away. Moreover, this Power of the King's to Name such of the qualify'd Nobility, as best pleases him, to these important Employments, keeps all the Gentry in a great Dependance on him; for the design of the Republic in lodging the Nomination of Officers in the King's Hands, was, that he should take care to confer them on those that had best deserv'd them by their Services, either in Peace or War, and ex∣clude such from them as had been Stubborn, Mutinous, and Unserviceable to the State. Another Reason that makes the King respect∣ed, is the natural Ambition the <HI>Poles</HI> have to Aspire to the Honours of the Kingdom; for by their Constitutions all the Nobles (as they call them) or Free-born of the Land, are equal as to their Birth, and none, though ne∣ver so Poor, ows precedence, unless through a Compliment, to any ever so Rich: Inso∣much, that Preferments and Honours are the only Means by which they attain to Prece∣dence, which is annex'd thereto, and ascer∣tain'd by the Statutes and Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="14"/>
Now one would think that this mighty Power which the King of <HI>Poland</HI> has to dispose of so many Places of Profit and Trust, so many Lands by Royal Tenure, and so many Benefices, must needs gain him the Love and Affection of those on whom they are conferr'd. But on the contrary, the <HI>Poles</HI> being none of the most grateful, and knowing too well that the King cannot dispose of those Preferments but to themselves; they believe that when he Grants them, he only gives back what of Right belongs to them; and that it is not so much an Act of Grace in him, as a piece of Justice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities pre∣sent their Keys upon his Ap∣proach.</NOTE> When a King of <HI>Poland</HI> comes to any City, the Inhabitants are oblig'd immediately to present him with the Keys, and he can send his Regiment of Guards to take pos∣session of the Gates. The Citizens of <HI>Dant∣zick</HI> only have a Privilege to keep their own Keys, and to hinder all but a few Troops from following the King into the City. It is certain, that <HI>Dantzick</HI> has more Immuni∣ties and Privileges than any other City of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> insomuch that it may be rather look'd upon to be a small Republic of it self under Protection of that Kingdom, than a City subject to it. Nay, it has in a manner all the Marks of a Sovereign Power, for it can Condemn to Death without Appeal even the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry, if they commit any Crime within its Territories and Jurisdiction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why he can raise no Forces without Consent of the <HI>Diet.</HI></NOTE> The King can raise no Troops at his own Charges without Consent of the <HI>Diet,</HI> and this for fear that he should strengthen himself, and Intrench upon their Liberties. Nevertheless

The King cannot on any Account whatever go out of the Kingdom, without Consent of the Diet; for, Your <HI>GRACE</HI> may observe that King <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> was fain to steal out of the Kingdom when he went into <HI>France; Sigismund</HI> III. after the Death of his Father <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> was forc'd to call a Diet at <HI>Warsaw</HI> in the Month of <HI>May</HI> 1592. to obtain Con∣sent to return into <HI>Sueden</HI> to take Possession of his Hereditary Kingdom; and that <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who was chosen King of <HI>Poland</HI> in the Year 1370, having a mind to return to his Native Kingdom, desired leave of the Senate, and was oblig'd to Augment their Privileges to obtain it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Legiti∣mate Issue greatly Re∣spected.</NOTE> The King's Children are more than ordi∣narily respected, though at the same time every private Gentleman thinks himself as great as they by the Law, and to have as law∣ful a Right to the Crown, yet are they ne∣vertheless always treated as Princes of the Blood Royal.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Means to continue the Crown in one Fa∣mily.</NOTE> The only way for a King of <HI>Poland</HI> to con∣tinue the Crown in his Family, is to be War∣like; to enlarge his Dominions; to gain the Love and Affections of his People by his own Merits, and by the Favour of the Clergy; to send his Children early to the Wars to get Credit and Reputation in the Army; to spend Liberally all his Revenues, and to die in Debt, to the end that the <HI>Poles</HI> may be en∣clin'd to Elect his Son, to enable him to pay what his Father ow'd. But all this while he must never think to encroach on the Privi∣leges of the Nation, nor endeavour by any means to render the Crown Hereditary; for whenever the <HI>Poles</HI> begin to smell out any such private Design, they are presently apt to stir up Seditious Tumults, which would prove very Pernicious to all the Posterity of that King, as the ill Success the Late King's Sons have had sufficiently demonstrates.</P>

Power; for the State of <HI>Denmark</HI> was quite different then from what that of <HI>Poland</HI> is now. In <HI>Denmark</HI> the King, Clergy, and Commonalty were under the Rule and Go∣vernment of the Gentry, so that it was the Interest of the Clergy and Commonalty to side with the King, to abate and depress the excessive Power and Privileges of the Nobi∣lity; which they soon effected, by being Re∣solute and more in Number. But in <HI>Poland</HI> it is quite otherwise; for there the Clergy and Gentry have a common Interest, to keep the King and People in Subjection. The Cler∣gy have great Privileges, and are very Rich. The Bishops for the most part are Princes or Dukes; they are all Senators, and sit in the Diet before all the Temporal Lords; so that by the great Authority and Veneration which they have procur'd to themselves from the sla∣vish People, they can hinder them from making any Insurrection; and by the Ar∣bitrary and Free Power which they and the Gentry have hitherto maintain'd, to Elect whom they pleas'd for King, they will always keep him in such a Dependence for the sake of his Children, that he shall hardly ever be able to effect any Design upon their Prerogatives. Nay, providing he had found any Opportu∣nity to compass such a dangerous Enterprize, yet would it not consist with Prudence either to declare or Attempt it, for fear of Incurring the Hatred and Displeasure of the People, which would not only tend to his own Ruin; but likewise Obstruct the Election of any of his Family to the Throne after his Death; so that the surest way for a King of <HI>Poland</HI> to

<HI>Poland,</HI> so that the King has the Nomination of as many Court-Officers as any Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> but most of them are rather Honorary than Beneficial; yet the Gentry always make great Interest to get into them; Precedence, of which they are Ambitious, being Regula∣ted according to the Nature and Dignity of the Employment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Of∣ficers of Queen's Court.</NOTE> As for the Queen's Court, it consists of about Thirty Officers, the Chief where∣of are her <HI>Marshal</HI> and Chancellor. Their Business is to Preside over Domestic Affairs in the Queen's Court. Her <HI>Marshal</HI> or Steward, is to carry the Staff before her; and her Chan∣cellor or Secretary, to Write, Sign, Re∣ceive, and Answer all her Letters. There is her Treasurer, who Manages her Revenue; her Master of the Horse, Cup-Bearers, Car∣vers, Sewers, Clerk of the Kitchen, &amp;c.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">What pecu∣liar to him.</NOTE> This Archbishop alone, as he is the Chief Senator of <HI>Poland,</HI> has Drums beating, and Trumpets sounding, both within and with∣out Doors, before he sits down to Table.

<P>Before, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I put an end to this Letter, permit me to take notice to Your <HI>GRACE,</HI> that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> does not Name his Privy-Counsellors, but all <HI>Senators</HI> are Counsellors of Course; for all of that Dignity that are about the Place where the King Resides, have a Right to sit at the Council-Board. For fear notwithstanding that there should not be always Senators suf∣ficient for that purpose at Court, the Senate al∣ways depute four of their Members to attend the King's Person by turns, and that not on∣ly to give him Advice, but likewise to In∣spect into his Conduct, and to prevent him from Acting contrary to the Laws: For the King and Council are accountable to the <HI>Diet</HI> for any Mismanagement in the Govern∣ment. In short, the Genius of the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation, and the whole Frame of their Con∣stitution, is entirely bent to Curb the King's Power, and to secure their Laws, and Pre∣rogatives, against the Incroaching Factions of Foreign Princes, or of their own Court-Party.</P>

to be mention'd; and what I cou'd on∣ly learn in so small a Time as I have lived in that Country.</P>

<P>YOUR <HI>Grace</HI>'s High Birth and Sta∣tion in our Government, together with Your Primary Right of Suffrage in our <HI>House of Lords,</HI> entitle you in a Super∣lative manner to the Patronage of this Letter.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Senate</HI> and its Of∣fice.</NOTE> The <HI>Senate</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> is an Order of No∣bles between the King and common Gentry, establish'd to rule and govern according to Law, and to observe the Conduct of the King: And moreover, they are to apply themselves to study the publick Good, and the Preservation of the Privileges of the Peo∣ple. It consists at present of a far greater Number of Persons than formerly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Senators,</HI> by whom made; and their Oath.</NOTE> It is the King that makes every <HI>Senator;</HI> but who being once so made, is to continue his Office for Life. At the Time of his Cre∣ation, he is oblig'd to take a solemn Oath, to conserve inviolable, the Rights and Li∣berties of the Republic; so that if the King himself had a mind to extend his Power and Authority, beyond the Limits prescrib'd him by the Laws, every <HI>Senator</HI>'s Oath alone would oblige him to acquaint his Majesty with due Respect of his Duty and Obligation. Nay, every <HI>Nuncio</HI> in the grand <HI>Diet,</HI> as∣sumes this Liberty: For, in that Place, <HI>di∣cunt quae sentiunt, &amp; sentiunt quae velint;</HI> as may appear by an insolent Affront put upon the late King <HI>John Sobieski,</HI> who having been call'd <HI>Tyrant, Nero,</HI> and many other opprobrious Names, by some of the <HI>Deputies,</HI> and not being able to bear it, he started up and threatned them, laying his Hand on his Sword, <HI>That had he been the great General still, he would have done something;</HI> whereat one of them rising likewise, and clapping his
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>
Hand to his Sword, reply'd, <HI>and that Sword would have done something too.</HI> Another Pas∣sage I have read, of <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Poland;</HI> who having been basely abus'd in the <HI>Diet,</HI> stood up and cry'd, <HI>Si non essem Rex</HI>—whereto the <HI>Orator</HI> briskly reply'd, <HI>Si non fuisses Rex.</HI>—</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Four to at∣tend the King, and wherefore.</NOTE> These <HI>Senators</HI> are likewise bound to see that nothing be done against their Privi∣leges; and therefore four of them are al∣ways deputed to attend the King with their Advice: Besides these four, who are ever actually the King's Counsel; any of the others in like manner, have a Right to assist at the Council-Board if they think fit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Senators</HI> not suffer'd to travel,</NOTE> The Presence of these <HI>Senators</HI> is look'd up∣on to be so absolutely necessary for the Good of the Kingdom, that not one of 'em can tra∣vel upon whatsoever Account, without Leave of the Republic. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sueton.

<P><MILESTONE N="I"/> The Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna</HI> is not only <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesia∣stical Sena∣tor, his Power and State.</NOTE>Chief of the Bishops, but also of all the other <HI>Senators</HI> of <HI>Poland.</HI> He is Primate of the King∣dom; a Title given him by the Council of <HI>Constance;</HI> and moreover, stiles himself the <HI>Pope's Legate Born,</HI> by a Grant of the Coun∣cil of <HI>Lateran.</HI> All Ecclesiastical Affairs that have been determin'd in the Archbishop of <HI>Leopol</HI>'s, or any of the other Bishops Courts, may be revers'd, or confirm'd in an Appeal to him. His Power and Authority is exceed∣ing great, and even next to the King's: It is Death to draw a Sword in his Presence, or to quarrel in any manner whatsoever before him: When he goes to the King, or the <HI>Di∣et,</HI> there is always a golden Cross carry'd be∣fore him; and when he sits, his Chaplain holds it behind his Chair. He has his <HI>Mar∣shal,</HI> who is a <HI>Castellan</HI> and <HI>Senator</HI> of the Kingdom. This Person on Horse-back, car∣ries a Staff before his Coach, but salutes none with it except the King, when the Arch∣bishop and he happen to meet. This Marshal has likewise the Honour to carry the like Staff before the King, where the other Mar∣shals are absent. When the Archbishop comes to wait on the King, the great <HI>Cham∣berlain,</HI> or some other great Officer, always receives him at the Stair-Foot, and the King afterwards comes out of his Chamber to meet
<PB N="39" REF="22" MS="y"/>
him in the <HI>Anti</HI>-Chamber. He never pays any Visits out of Duty, but to the Pope's <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and to him only but once. He vi∣sits no King's Ambassadors, tho' they visit him first.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Power as <HI>Inter. Rex.</HI></NOTE> After the King's Death he is the supream Regent of the Kingdom till a new one be chosen; during which Time, he may coin Money in his own Name, a Privilege granted him by <HI>Boleslaus</HI> the Chaste; but which never∣theless has not been practis'd, no Money ha∣ving ever been seen of his coining. The Re∣venues also of the Crown belong to him in the <HI>Inter-Regnum;</HI> he convokes the <HI>Diet,</HI> and dissolves it at Pleasure; and in case there happens any thing extraordinary, the Go∣vernment assigns him several <HI>Senators</HI> for his Assistants. In short, he is <HI>Tantum non Rex.</HI> He only can proclaim the King when elected, and crown him afterwards (except where he dies, as in the following Case) which is so very considerable, that he is look'd upon, by the Ambassadors and Envoys of the Candi∣dates, as the only Person upon whom the Suc∣cess of their Negotiation depends▪ and therefore all of them do their utmost to make him their Friend.</P>
<P>Hereupon I must acquaint your <HI>Grace</HI> with a Passage in the Election of the late King of <HI>Poland, John</HI> III. in the Year 1674. when one <HI>Czartoreski</HI> was Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna;</HI> who being entirely in the <HI>Austrian</HI> Interest, and a great Friend to the Chancellor <HI>Patz,</HI> and by consequence, both an Enemy to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>John Sobieski</HI>'s Party, could by no means be brought to proclaim him; but as it hap∣pened,
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>
he dy'd three Days before the Electi∣on, and that Power devolv'd to <HI>Trzebicki,</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Cracow,</HI> who being altogether for the Grand <HI>Marshal,</HI> forthwith proclaim'd him with Joy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why en∣trusted so much.</NOTE> The Reason why the <HI>Republic</HI> entrusts this great Authority to a Clergy-Man, is for Fear, that if it were bestow'd on a secular <HI>Senator,</HI> he might make use of it to advance himself to the Throne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> See.</NOTE> This Archbishop's <HI>See</HI> is at <HI>Lowitz,</HI> a City in the Palatinate of <HI>Rava,</HI> in Lower <HI>Poland.</HI> He is born a Canon of the Church of <HI>Plosko.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other Bishops in <HI>Leopol.</HI></NOTE> This City is the Seat of three Bishops, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholick Archbishop, the <HI>Arme∣nian</HI>-Catholick Archbishop, and a <HI>Russian Greek</HI> Schismatic Bishop. These two Arch∣bishops have the same Belief and Religion, only the <HI>Armenian</HI> have some particular Ce∣remonies wherein they differ, and the Wo∣men are separated from the Men in the Church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Those of the <HI>Greek</HI> Per∣swasion.</NOTE> The <HI>Russian</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI>-Schismatic Bishops cannot Marry, because they must of necessi∣ty be chosen out of the <HI>Order</HI> of Fryars of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> who all make a Vow of Chastity. Nevertheless the Parish Priests are not oblig'd to live in Coelibacy, that is, if they were ad∣mitted into Orders after their Marriage, for
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
they cannot be constrain'd to leave their Wives; but however, when their Wives dye, they cannot Marry again, unless they have a mind to relinquish their Priest∣hood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Te∣nets, Cere∣monies, and Ornoments.</NOTE> Their Liturgy is in the <HI>Russian</HI> Language, being as the <HI>Polish,</HI> a Dialect of the <HI>Sclavo∣vian.</HI> Their Tenets are, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father by the Son, and that the Pope is not Head of all the Church, but only the first of the two Patri∣archs, whereof theirs of <HI>Constantinople</HI> is the se∣cond, and independent of the first. In other Articles of Belief they agree with the <HI>Roman</HI> Church: Their Ceremonies and Or∣naments differ from the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Armeni∣an.</HI> They pray standing, tho' they make fre∣quent Genuflexions: They receive the Com∣munion in both Kinds after this manner: The Priest consecrates several little Pieces of Bread made with Leaven; after which he re∣ceives himself, and then breaks the Bread in divers little Pieces; which done, he puts 'em into the Chalice with the consecrated Wine, and then with a little Silver Spoon, made for that purpose, he communicates to the People, who all stand, with their Arms across upon their Breasts, when they receive. This done, the Communicants follow the Priest thrice about the Altar with folded Arms, who all the while advises and charges them to make good Cheer for seven Days to∣gether, and to fast the next seven Days after that. The <HI>Russians</HI> likewise make their Chil∣dren communicate, tho' never so young. When they have all taken the Sacramen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,

the Priest consumes the rest at his Plea∣sure.</P>

What is re∣markable in this Bishoprick is, that the Archbishoprick and that have frequently been held by the same Person.

<P>There are two Sorts of <HI>Greek</HI> Churches in this Kingdom; the Schismaticks and the <HI>Ʋni∣ats;</HI> whereof the latter differ only from the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, in that their Devotion is all in the <HI>Greek</HI> Language.

These three Years were afterwards reduc'd to two by a follow∣ing Edict: But notwithstanding these positive Laws, several of this Sect lurking about in the Kingdom, from time to time, and some being protected by the Favour of the Gentry, the late King <HI>John Sobieski</HI> publish'd a new <NOTE PLACE="marg">1673.</NOTE>Edict more severe than either of the former, whereby the <HI>Socinians</HI> were forthwith driven out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lutherans, <HI>and</HI> Calvinists.</NOTE> I must not omit to acquaint Your <HI>GRACE,</HI> that there are abundance of <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> in this Kingdom, and that chiefly in the Province of Regal-<HI>Prussia,</HI> who have all Liberty of Conscience allow'd them, and whom the King is oblig'd to tolerate and protect by his Coronation-Oath.

As for the <HI>Armenians,</HI> they inhabit chiefly in cer∣tain Towns of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Podolia,</HI> and have their peculiar Prelates, Abbots, and Priests: Their Service is always exercis'd in their own Language: These, as in other Coun∣tries, acknowledge the Supremacy of the <HI>See</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> are every where to be found in <HI>Poland,</HI> and enjoy their Religion, and other Privileges, without Interruption; only they are restrain'd from trading within twelve Leagues of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> by the <HI>Constitutions.</HI> Their Number is so great, that Mr. <HI>Patric Ogleby,</HI> who has travell'd all over these Coun∣tries, affirms, that there are above two Mil∣lions of them in this Kingdom, and that they are so privileg'd, that all this vast Body pays not above a hundred and twenty thousand <HI>Tinfes</HI> or <HI>Florens</HI> a Year to the <HI>States;</HI> which amounts to no more than twenty thousand <HI>Dollars.</HI> In the great Dutchy of <HI>Listhuania,</HI> there are moreover about thirty thousand <HI>Tartars,</HI> with Liberty of the <HI>Turkish Religion.</HI> They have been there near six hundred Years, and for the continuance of their Privileges, they are oblig'd to send twelve hundred Men Yearly to the Wars against the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tar∣tars.</HI>

There are likewise a great many Ido∣laters on the Frontiers of this Kingdom, who still retain their ancient Superstitions, whereof one is, that whenever any one dies, and tho it be a Year or more afterwards, that another dies likewise; they presently go and dig up the first Body, and cut off its Head, thereby to prevent, as they say, the Death of any more of their Family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick prevails,</NOTE> Notwithstanding <HI>Poland</HI> admits of all these Religions, yet that which prevails most, is the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, which the <HI>Poles</HI> have continued stedfast in for above 700.

that nothing may be transacted there in Pre∣judice of that Faith.

In like man∣ner, the great Officers of the <HI>Crown</HI> are of∣tentimes Bishops, and the great Secretary of the whole Kingdom has always been an <HI>Ec∣clesiastick.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Privileges of <HI>Regular</HI> Clergy.</NOTE> The <HI>Regular</HI> Clergy in <HI>Poland,</HI> are general∣ly more esteem'd than the <HI>Secular;</HI> for they can perform all the Offices of Parish Priests, without having Permission from the Bishops: And Fryar-<HI>Mendicants</HI> are allow'd to enter the most private Part of any House without so much as knocking at the Door.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their disso∣lute Lives.</NOTE> These <HI>Regular</HI> Clergy are generally very rich, but not less dissolute and immodest; for they frequently go into the <HI>Cellars</HI> to drink, being the Tipling Places of this Country, and sometimes you shall see many of them so drunk in the Streets, that they are scarce able to go upon their Legs, and this without either their <HI>Superiours</HI> or the Peoples taking any Notice of them.</P>

long.

They also are so obstinate in their abstaining from Flesh, that they will not eat any, tho they be sick and advis'd thereto by their Doctors, and permitted by their Priests.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners of the <HI>Secular</HI> Clergy.</NOTE> As for the Secular Inferiour Clergy, they are either Collegiate or Parochial, and both are much after the same Nature as with us. The <HI>Canons</HI> are never almost present at the <HI>Office,</HI> for they give the poor Scholars two Pence a Day to say their <HI>Hours</HI> for them in the <HI>Quoir.</HI> The Parsons generally neglect their <HI>Cures,</HI> by leaving most of their Duty to the Monks or Vicars and Curates. They al∣ways sing Part of the Service in the <HI>Polish</HI> Language, and that especially in the Parish-Churches at High-<HI>Mass.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rosary</HI> is also daily repeated in the <HI>Dominicans</HI> Chappels, in which the Men are seated, and join in the Repetition, on one Side, and the Women on the other; the former alone singing the <HI>Ave Maria,</HI> and the latter the <HI>Sancta Maria.</HI></P>
<P>Plurality of Benefices is here tolerated; for there are some of these secular Clergy who have not only two <HI>Canonships,</HI> but also

two Parsonages: But there are none that take any Care to perform the Duties of their Function. The Bishops themselves are so careless of their Episcopal Functions, that they care not to correct the inferiour Clergy when they do amiss.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> Behaviour at Church.</NOTE> At Divine Service the <HI>Poles</HI> always seem very devout, and bestow considerable Gifts upon their Churches; but they are neither liberal to the <HI>Poor,</HI> nor careful of their sick Servants. They pray always aloud in the Church, and at the Elevation of the <HI>Host</HI> at <HI>Mass,</HI> they cuff themselves, and knock their Heads against the Pavement, or the Bench whereon they sit, with so great Violence, that it commonly makes a great deal of Noise, and may be heard at a considerable Distance. The Women commonly have their Prayer-Books, with a <HI>Chaplet</HI> of Beads in the Middle of them. In Winter the Ladies of Quality, and even some Men, have furr'd Bags brought to Church for them, to preserve their Feet from the excessive Cold: They al∣so wear little furr'd Mantles on their Shoul∣ders for the same purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Churches.</NOTE> I shall now only further observe to Your <HI>GRACE,</HI> as to this Subject of Religion, that the Churches in <HI>Poland</HI> are extreamly fine, and well adorn'd; as also that the <HI>Jesu∣ites</HI> of <HI>Leopol</HI> have a <HI>Chasuble</HI> or <HI>Cope,</HI> which the Priests wear at <HI>Mass,</HI> cover'd so thick with Pearls, that, by reason of its Heavi∣ness, it is of little or no Use.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Office and Power.</NOTE> The Chancellor's Office is to take Cogni∣zance of all civil Affairs; to see Justice done, the Laws observ'd, and to render ineffectual the Cabals and Intrigues of foreign Princes, in Prejudice of the Liberties and Authority of the Republick. They are to seal all the King's Mandates and Grants, and to receive and answer all his Letters. Their Power also is so great, that they can seal several things without the King's Consent, and refuse as many, where he commands, if they are con∣trary to the Constitution of the <HI>State.</HI> The Chancellor, or in his Absence, the Vice-Chancellor, answer to all Speeches made the King, and propose all Matters to be debated in the Senate. He of the two that is Ecclesi∣astical, hath a Power over the King's Secre∣taries, Chaplains and Preachers; as likewise over all the Ceremonies of the Church, which in any wise relate to the King.

They also have the keeping of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> as the Crown, Scepter, Globe, Sword of State, Robes, &amp;c. They moreover have in their Custody all the King's Furniture and Re∣cords, and are to preside in the Office of the Mint: They likewise pay all Salaries, either of the Military or civil List. The Treasu∣rers Privilege is so great, that they are not oblig'd to give any Account, either to the King, or any of his Officers, how they per∣form their Trust; but in due Time the <HI>Diet</HI> appointing Commissioners for that Purpose, they are oblig'd faithfully to charge and dis∣charge

themselves before them; otherwise the Republick may sue them for it, and confis∣cate their Lands: Nevertheless the Treasu∣rers (who most commonly misemploy the publick Stock) by treating the Commissio∣ners well, and making them considerable Pre∣sents withal, often obtain their Discharge without much Difficulty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remark∣able Breach of Trust.</NOTE> I may here give your <HI>Grace</HI> an Account of a Passage that happen'd when Count <HI>Morstyn</HI> was great Treasurer of <HI>Poland,</HI> who having more Regard to his own private Interest, than publick Benefit, sent all the Riches of the Treasury into <HI>France,</HI> when fearing that the <HI>Diet</HI> would soon think fit to call him to Account, he retir'd privately with all his Effects out of the Kingdom, and went to settle in <HI>France,</HI> where he purchas'd the whole County of <HI>Chateau-Villain,</HI> which is worth above an hundred thousand Livres a Year.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extra-Se∣natorial Officers</NOTE> It will not be here amiss to acquaint Your <HI>Grace,</HI> that besides these ten Crown-Officers there are three other Sorts of Officers which are not <HI>Senators,</HI> and they are either of the Kingdom and Great Dutchy, the King's Court, or belonging peculiarly to <HI>Palatinates</HI> and <HI>Di∣stricts.</HI> The Principal of the first Kind are these:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Ge∣nerals</NOTE> The two Grand Generals, of the Crown and Great Dutchy, who are the King's imme∣diate Substitutes, and have a full Power to do whatever his Majesty could, were he pre∣sent. Tho this Dignity of Great General be the most considerable and honorable of any in the Republic, yet does it not make the Person that enjoys it to be a <HI>Senator,</HI> nor qualifies him to have the least Seat in the <HI>Diet,</HI> unless he be therewithal a <HI>Palatin</HI> or <HI>Castellan,</HI> as most commonly he is.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Have equal Authority.</NOTE> The two great Generals of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Li∣thuania</HI> have equal Power in their respective <HI>States,</HI> and have no Dependance upon each other, unless that the Great General of <HI>Lithu∣ania</HI> always gives Place to him of <HI>Poland;</HI> yet has he the sole Command of the great Dutchy's Army, and receives no manner of Orders from the Crown-General, except where both are jointly engag'd in a Bat∣tle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Power,</NOTE> These great Generals in the King's Ab∣sence, have the greatest Power in the King∣dom, for they have then a supreme Command in the Army: They give Battle, and be∣siege
<PB N="75" REF="40"/>
Towns without the King's Participati∣on, and settle Winter-Quarters where, and upon what Lands they think fit: This Pow∣er of theirs is so extraordinary considerable, that a great General is formidable to all the Nobility.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and Duty.</NOTE> Their Duty is to keep good Order and Discipline in the Army; to punish mutinous and seditious Officers and Soldiers; to settle the Prizes of all Commodities and Provisions brought into the Camp; to give Command or necessary Orders for a Charge or Retreat: and in fine, to do any thing that his Majesty could were he present.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's In∣terest to head his Army.</NOTE> It is therefore the Interest of a King of <HI>Po∣land</HI> always to head his Army himself, to have his Sons with him in the Field, and to give them Opportunity to gain Reputation and Credit by their Valour and Conduct; for the more the King encreases his own Fame, or that of his Sons, the more he dimi∣nishes the Credit and Power of his Generals, who are the only Persons in the Kingdom that are most to be fear'd, and who have the greatest Power and Influence over the Gentry in the Election of a King.</P>

By the Constitutions of the Kingdom, the King is oblig'd to call a <HI>Diet</HI> every third Year, and of every three succes∣sively call'd, two must be held in <HI>Poland,</HI> most commonly at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and the third in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> in the City of <HI>Grodno,</HI> in the <HI>Pa∣latinate</HI> of <HI>Troki,</HI> twenty Leagues from <HI>Vilna,</HI> Capital of this great Dutchy: So that every ninth Year the King, with all the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> of the Kingdom, goes into <HI>Lithua∣nia;</HI> and every third the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Depu∣ties</HI> of <HI>Lithuania</HI> come into <HI>Poland.</HI> The Reason of the <HI>Diet</HI>'s being held in <HI>Lithuania</HI> was, because the <HI>Lithuanians</HI> complain'd that
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>
it was not a little inconvenient for them to come so far as <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of calling it, and Pro∣ceedings thereupon.</NOTE> When the King has a mind to convoke this general Meeting, he is to send out circular Letters six Weeks before the time he ap∣points for its Session, by the Constitution in the Year 1613. to all the <HI>Palatins</HI> of the Pro∣vinces, acquainting them with his Design, together with the Time he intends it shall meet. He sends them likewise a List of all the Affairs and Articles which are to be treat∣ed of in that <HI>Diet.</HI> Whereupon every <HI>Pala∣tin</HI> or his Deputy, in his own respective Go∣vernment, forthwith dispatches Notice to all the <HI>Castellans, Starostas,</HI> and other Gentry, requiring them at a certain Time to meet to∣gether, in order to deliberate on the Articles and Affairs propos'd by the King's Letters, as likewise to choose a <HI>Nuncio</HI> or Deputy to represent their Intentions and Decisions in the Great <HI>Diet.</HI> These Letters are pro∣claim'd by a Herald (call'd by the <HI>Poles Woz∣ny)</HI> and afterwards pasted up upon all the Town-Gates and Church-Doors. These Assemblies in the Provinces are term'd by them <HI>Comitiola</HI> (in the <HI>Polish</HI> Language <HI>Seymi∣ki)</HI> or little <HI>Diets.</HI> In Cases of Extremity, six Weeks Notice need not be given, as ap∣pears by the <HI>Constitutions</HI> of the Year, 1638.</P>

One of these Gentry once hinder'd a Person from being chosen Chairman of a little <HI>Diet</HI> till the Candidate had given him a Pair of <HI>Polish</HI> Boots, for he was before almost bare-footed, after which he consented and came in and approv'd of the Election.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of voting in little <HI>Di∣ets.</HI></NOTE> All the Decisions here, as in the great <HI>Diet,</HI> did not formerly go by Plurality of Voices, but by unanimous Consent, which frequently bred abundance of Disorder, and often∣times the <HI>Diets</HI> broke up without having con∣cluded any thing, and that by reason of the Contests and Obstinacy of some private Members who had the Power to oppose all the rest, and who most commonly were bri∣bed by one Side or other. At these little <HI>Diets</HI> the poorer Sort of Gentry always side with their Seigneur, and ever approve of what he says, without knowing sometimes what the Matter in Hand is: An Example whereof, Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, happen'd in his Time at one of these Assemblies, in the Province of <HI>Maso∣via,</HI> where some Affairs of the Province being in Debate, and one of the Gentry declaring against them, his Party or Mob, not knowing what the Business was, cry'd like Mad-men, that such an Affair should not pass, whereupon a witty Fellow, observing
<PB N="88" REF="50"/>
their senseless Rage, started up and cry'd, <HI>Brethren, you are Fools to oppose this Affair, for the Question is only to abate the Price of Wheat and</HI> Aquavitae; whereat they immediately consented to, and approv'd of the Matter propos'd, and cry'd, <HI>that their Seigneur was a Rogue that had betray'd them,</HI> and moreover threatned him with their Sabres.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who, and how many chosen De∣puties: With their Instructi∣ons.</NOTE> Notwithstanding every little Gentleman can vote for whom he pleases, yet the Electi∣on always falls upon some rich Nobleman, who can treat high, and make a Figure suita∣ble to this honourable Charge. Most com∣monly they choose two or three <HI>Deputies</HI> for every Palatinate; one of which is always an understanding Man, and the rest are young Noblemen, chosen only for Honours sake, or that they may be train'd up betimes in the Service of their Country. When the <HI>Depu∣ties</HI> are chosen, they receive full Instructions from the Gentry of their Province, of what they are to consent or dissent to in the general <HI>Diet,</HI> and when once they are intrusted with these Instructions, they dare not for their Lives transgress them; so that if but one <HI>Deputy</HI> has Orders contrary to the rest, it lies in his single Power to break all their Mea∣sures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings in lit∣tle <HI>Diets.</HI></NOTE> In these little <HI>Diets,</HI> their first Care is to choose a <HI>Marshal</HI> or Chair-man, whose Of∣fice is much the same with the <HI>Marshal</HI> or Speaker of the general <HI>Diet.</HI></P>

<P>He that designs to get to be elected <HI>Mar∣shal,</HI> must treat the Gentry all the while, otherwise he would have no Vote for him, and commonly they prolong the Election that they may live the longer at the Candi∣dates Charges.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How occasi∣on'd.</NOTE> The Reason of this great stickling is, be∣cause the Dignity of this <HI>Marshal</HI> is not only very honourable, but also exceeding benefici∣al, which occasions several Noblemen among the Deputies, to raise Cabals and In∣trigues to secure it for themselves. He has likewise great Authority, and can, by his eloquent and subtle Speeches, turn Affairs on
<PB N="93" REF="52"/>
what Side he pleases, which is the Reason that he is often brib'd either by the King, Foreign Princes, or some great Men of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Next Pro∣ceeding.</NOTE> On the Day prefix'd for the Meeting of the <HI>Diet,</HI> the King, with all the Senators and Nuncios, goes to hear a Sermon, which be∣ing ended, he retires into the <HI>Senate,</HI> where he is severally saluted by the Members there∣of: And the <HI>Nuncios</HI> retiring likewise into their House (call'd by the <HI>Poles, Izba Posels∣ka)</HI> confer together about electing a Speaker, during which, the last Speaker or <HI>Marshal</HI> officiates till a new one be chosen, and then is oblig'd to resign his Staff to the <HI>Marshal</HI> elect, who is to take an Oath to be true and faithful before he enters upon his Office.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further Proceed∣ings.</NOTE> When the <HI>Marshal</HI> or Speaker is elected, he with all the <HI>Deputies</HI> of the Province, goes to kiss the King's Hand in the <HI>Diet</HI>-Chamber, where his Majesty sits on a Throne erected for that Purpose. Then the Chancellor in the King's Name proposes all the Points to be debated in the <HI>Diet,</HI> and desires the <HI>Senators</HI> and Nobility to take them into Consideration, whereupon the King immediately leaves them, lest his Presence might be an Awe upon them; and then the Senators retiring into their Room by themselves, and the <HI>Nuncios</HI> into theirs, by them call'd <HI>Izba Poselska,</HI> they forthwith set about deliberating on the Arti∣cles propos'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflection of <HI>Haute∣ville.</HI></NOTE> Here <HI>SIR,</HI> I may remark a pleasant Reflection of <HI>Hauteville,</HI> in his Account of <HI>Poland,</HI> where he says, <HI>That the</HI> Poles <HI>employ</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="53"/>
more Time in drinking and feasting, than in de∣bating Matters of State, for that they never think on that Work till they begin to want Money to buy <HI>Hungarian</HI> Wine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Speakers</HI> Request for the <HI>Depu∣ties.</HI></NOTE> After the Chancellor has thus propos'd to the <HI>Diet</HI> in the King's Name, all the Articles they are to go upon, the <HI>Marshal</HI> of the <HI>Nun∣cios</HI> likwise on the Part of the <HI>Deputies,</HI> pre∣sents to the King what they desire of his Ma∣jesty, which is,</P>
<P N="1">1. To make void all Intrenchments, ei∣ther upon the State or the People. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. To bestow all vacant Offices upon Per∣sons of Worth and Merit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Autho∣rity.</NOTE> This Marshal of the Deputies has a great Authority over them in the <HI>Diet,</HI> for he it is that commands Silence among'em, and who transmits all their Requests to the King or Senate; and seeing that by his Power he can either animate or moderate them, it is not to be wonder'd at if he be a Person of no ordina∣ry Esteem, and that the Court always en∣deavours, by various Favours, to secure him for their Friend.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in the low∣er House.</NOTE> The Manner of Proceedings in the <HI>Nunci∣os</HI> House is much the same as in the Little <HI>Di∣ets:</HI> No body offers his Opinion there till having first ask'd Leave of the <HI>Marshal,</HI> who alone introduces all Messengers from the King, <HI>Senators,</HI> Army, or Foreign Princes, and answers them all in the Name of the House. If any Disserences arise among the <HI>Nuncios</HI> or other Tumults are rais'd by the
<PB N="95" REF="53"/>
Spectators, he causes Silence immediately, by striking his Staff against the Ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference<SUP>s</SUP> with the Upper, and <HI>Nuncios</HI> Power.</NOTE> The two Orders being thus separated, there are nevertheless frequent Intercourses be∣tween them, as are between our two most Ho∣nourable Houses. The <HI>Nuncios</HI> have a Pow∣er of impeaching all Magistrates and Officers for Male Administration, and to put the King in mind, as often as they think fit, of his Coronation-Oath: Moreover, the <HI>Nun∣cios</HI> Power and Authority appears the great∣er, in that no Constitution or Law is of any Validity or Force that was not first begun in their House. Nay, their <HI>Marshal</HI> is to be the first Starter of all Laws, and when con∣cluded upon, it is his Office only to read them before the Senate. For this Reason, in the Year 1668. the <HI>Marshal</HI> protested against a certain Law, because it was first concerted in the Senate.

The great <HI>Marshal</HI> has Authority, not only to check a <HI>Nuncio,</HI> but also a <HI>Senator</HI> in speaking, if he exceeds his Bounds: He also, in case of great Disorders, imposes Silence, by striking his Staff on the Ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the King sus∣pends his Opinion.</NOTE> In Cases of Controversy, the King always suspends his Opinion till the Differences are reconcil'd. This the Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> promis'd faithfully to observe, as may appear by the Book of their Laws, Page 254.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What re∣quir'd to establish a Law.</NOTE> To establish a Law or Constitution in the <HI>Diet,</HI> the Deputies must first propose it by their <HI>Marshal,</HI> and then the King and Senate are to approve of it; but however, before it can have any Force, it must be review'd by the great <HI>Marshal</HI> and two <HI>Deputies,</HI> or by three <HI>Senators</HI> and six <HI>Deputies.</HI> Having been thus review'd, it is read out in the <HI>Diet</HI> by the Nuncio-<HI>Marshal,</HI> after which the Chan∣cellors demand with a low Voice, <HI>If the King, Senate, and Deputies consent to apply the Seal;</HI> which being answer'd in the affirmative,
<PB N="98" REF="55"/>
it is presently seal'd and enroll'd among the Acts in the Register of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and this by the Care of the <HI>Deputy's Marshal,</HI> who is to see it done soon after the Conclusion of the Session. After this, one of the King's Secre∣taries is to get it printed and dispers'd among the several little <HI>Diets</HI> and Tribunals all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where it cannot be printed:</NOTE> It must be observ'd that where the <HI>Diet</HI> has been dissolv'd thro' the Obstinacy of any particular Member, no Laws or Constituti∣ons can be committed to the Press: Where∣upon in the Year 1665. the <HI>Nuncios</HI> severely reprov'd their <HI>Marshal</HI> for but suffering them to be transcrib'd where the Session had been adjourn'd.</P>
<P>The same Law is to be observ'd in all Decrees of the <HI>Diet,</HI> for immediately after the publish¦ing of them by the <HI>Referendary,</HI> they are to be transcrib'd, sign'd, seal'd, and printed▪ Those Decrees that concern the Treasury, are to be sign'd only by a Prothonotary ap∣pointed for that Purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Session of the <HI>Diet</HI> limited.</NOTE> By the Constitution of the Kingdom, the <HI>Diet</HI> ought never to sit above six Weeks, and the Gentry are so very exact in observing this Privilege, that as soon as ever that Time is expir'd, they send their <HI>Marshal</HI> to take Leave of the King in their Name, and more∣over to acquaint him that they intend to wait on him to kiss his Hand, which they are ad∣mitted to do soon after. They are so obstinate∣ly bent upon defending this Custom, that tho' the Urgencies of State require never so short a Continuance of the <HI>Diet</HI> after the Time prescrib'd, yet they always vigorously
<PB N="99" REF="55"/>
oppose it, as they did in the Year 1649. when the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Cosacks</HI> had almost over-run the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherefore.</NOTE> The Reason, I suppose, why the Members of the <HI>Diet</HI> are so punctual in observing this Constitution above any other is, because by that Time their Money generally is spent, and other Provisions, which they bring in Waggons from home, as Beer, Wine, Meat, Fowl, &amp;c. Consum'd by the great Train of Guards and other Domesticks which they have with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs treated of in the Grand <HI>Di∣et.</HI></NOTE> The Affairs generally treated of in the grand <HI>Diet,</HI> are either a King's Election or his Marriage; sending Ambassadours to Fo∣reign Princes; declaring War or making Peace; imposing Taxes to carry on a War; making Alliances with other Princes; and all other State Affairs: Likewise all Suits of Law between private Persons, have their last Ap∣peal from the Tribunals to the <HI>Diet:</HI> As may appear by the Difference adjusted by them between the Order of <HI>Malta</HI> and Prince <HI>De∣metrius Wiesnowiski,</HI> who with-held Possession of what was given by his Brother-in-Law, the Duke of <HI>Ostrog,</HI> to this <HI>Order.</HI> Also in cri∣minal Cases they judge and condemn as they did those who assassinated <HI>Gonczeski,</HI> Lieute∣nant General of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> who had all their Heads cut off by Proceedings in this Court.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who not to be present at Tryals for Treason.</NOTE> In Cases of High-Treason, the <HI>Poles</HI> say their King ought not to be present at the Tryal of any Traytor, and therefore the Marshal <HI>Lubomirski</HI> complain'd of <HI>John Casi∣mir</HI>'s condemning him in the <HI>Diet</HI> for Contu∣macy. Also they do not generally admit the
<PB N="100" REF="56"/>
<HI>Nuncios</HI> at that Time, tho <HI>Stephen Batori,</HI> at a <HI>Diet</HI> held at <HI>Warsaw</HI> in the Year 1582. caus'd them to be present at the Tryal of <HI>Shorowski</HI> for Treason, to the End that they might all be Witnesses of the Injustice done him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naturali∣zation and Manner of making <HI>Noble</HI> in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> 'Tis likewise in the <HI>Diet</HI> that Strangers are naturaliz'd, and Natives of the Country, who are not free-born, are made Gentlemen. Formerly no Person was capable of this Ho∣nour, but such only as had serv'd in the Wars for a considerable Time, or else who had done some other good Service to the <HI>State;</HI> but now there needs no other Merit or good Qualities than to be rich enough to purchase the Favour of the Court, or the Protection of some great Man. They that pretend to the <HI>Indigenat,</HI> that is, to be made Noble, have no more to do than to apply themselves to the <HI>Nuncio-Marshal,</HI> who has the Power to put their Names into the Roll of those that desire to be made <HI>Polish</HI> Gentle∣men. After which they are to give in a Note of their Genealogy, Names, Sir-names, Fa∣mily, and Services; and to put their Arms in the Middle. When they have been receiv'd and accepted by the <HI>Diet,</HI> and have got their Patent sign'd, they are to take an Oath be∣fore the same <HI>Marshal</HI> to be true and faithful to their King and Country, and whereof the <HI>Marshal</HI> afterwards gives them a Certifi∣cate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Restrain'd in some Re¦spects not∣with stand∣ing.</NOTE> Nevertheless, tho the Candidate be de∣clar'd <HI>Noble</HI> by the unanimous Consent of the three Orders, yet is he capable only of mean Employments, and to have a Vote among
<PB N="101" REF="56"/>
the Gentry, it not being in the Power of the King to bestow either on him or his Children any important Preferment till the third Gene∣ration be past, and the Republick is thereby satisfy'd of their Fidelity, Loyalty, and Af∣fection for their Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Con∣course at the <HI>Diet.</HI></NOTE> Tho' no other Person but the King, <HI>Senate,</HI> and <HI>Nuncios</HI> can have any Business or Vote in the <HI>Diet,</HI> yet vast Numbers of other People still flock thither. Also most commonly Fo∣reign Princes choose then to send their Am∣bassadors according to the Interest they have to maintain in the <HI>Diet.</HI> At this time like∣wise the greatest Part of the Nobility, that have wherewithal to appear in any Sort of Grandeur, meet here together with their Wives and Children, tho' they have no other Business than to see and be seen. It is then their Sons get acquainted with others of the young Gentry, and often are marry'd to some of the young Ladies that come in like manner to be observ'd, and to get Husbands. In short, the <HI>Diet</HI> is a kind of general Ren∣devouz of all the People of Quality in the Kingdom, as well Men and Women as Chil∣dren, so that what City soever the <HI>Diet</HI> sits in, there are always Thirty Thousand, and sometimes Forty thousand Persons more than there us'd to be.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provisions indifferent Planty not∣withstand∣ing.</NOTE> Nevertheless Provisions are not very scarce, by reason that every Gentleman almost brings his Necessaries along with him: Nay, the greatest Part send their Fuel and Provender for their Horses by the River <HI>Vistula</HI> to <HI>War∣saw,</HI> when they come from that Side of the
<PB N="102" REF="57"/>
Country. There are likewise several Gen∣tlemen that always come from <HI>Germany, Swe∣den,</HI> and other adjacent Countries, to see this general Meeting, which is a fine Sight, and the only thing that is worth observing in <HI>Po∣land.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangerous to walk a Nights.</NOTE> At this Time there is always such a Crowd of Soldiers, <HI>Heydukes,</HI> and Footmen in the Streets, that it is not safe to be abroad after Day shut in, for Fear of being rob'd or strip'd naked, as happens almost every Night, for the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry give so very short Allowance to their Guards and Servants, a Dragoon having but fifteen Pence of our Money a Week, to maintain his Horse and himself, that they must be forc'd to rob, or be otherwise very industrious to live.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Visits at this Time unaccepta∣ble.</NOTE> This is the Reason that Visits from these Gen∣try are seldom acceptable to any Body. The great <HI>Senators,</HI> and more especially the Generals of the Army, come always so nu∣merously attended, that the King himself, for greater Security, is always wont to in∣crease his Guards at the Time of the <HI>Diet,</HI> otherwise he might be expos'd to the Insults of the Gentry, who often take a Liberty in the <HI>Diet</HI> to threaten and abuse him to his Face.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Guards of some Gen∣try.</NOTE> Some of these Gentry have a Row, and sometimes two Rows of Guards that reach from their Houses to the King's Palace, where the <HI>Diet</HI> is kept.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of Session in the Diet.</NOTE> The Order of Session in the <HI>Diet</HI> is as follows. First the King sits on a Throne under a Cano∣py, upon which are plac'd on each side the Arms
<PB N="103" REF="57"/>
of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania:</HI> On the two Sides of the Throne stand the Ten <HI>Senator</HI>-Officers, whereof five for <HI>Poland</HI> are on the right Hand, and as many for <HI>Lithuania</HI> on the left. Then the Bishops sit in two Rows, whereof the first part are on the Right Hand with the Archbi∣shop of <HI>Gnesna,</HI> and the other on the Left, with the Archbishop of <HI>Leopol:</HI> Below and behind the Bishops sit the <HI>Senators</HI> according to their respective Precedence; and next be∣hind them stand the Deputies of the Provin∣ces, all with their Caps off. All the <HI>Senators</HI> sit cover'd before the King in the <HI>Senate,</HI> tho' in all other Places they stand bare before him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Members wear no di∣stinguish∣ing Habits.</NOTE> The Members of this <HI>Diet</HI> wear no particu∣lar Habit of Ceremony or formal Distinction, but sit in the same Cloaths they usually wear at home, with their Swords or Sabres girt by their Sides. The same Custom is observ'd by all the Judges and Magistrates of the King∣dom. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hartnoch lib. 2. cap. 3. p. 512.</NOTE><HI>Sigismundus Augustus</HI> is said to have en∣deavour'd to distinguish the <HI>Palatins</HI> from the <HI>Castellans,</HI> and those from the <HI>Nuncios,</HI> by different Habits, but this without Effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What proves E∣quality a∣mong <HI>Polish Gentry.</HI></NOTE> Nothing proves the Equality of the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry more than the Order of their Great and little <HI>Diets,</HI> for tho' all the Free-born are by them divided into the greater and Lesser, or rather Richer and Poorer Nobility, yet have they all the same Power in the <HI>Diets,</HI> and in making or breaking Constitutions, the <HI>Minor</HI> Gentry of every Province being supe∣riour in Number, keep, by their Votes, and
<PB N="104" REF="58"/>
sometimes by their Scymitars, the greater Sort in Awe. Their Power is so extraordi∣nary, by reason of their Number, that the great Gentry do in a manner depend upon the little, and that in so great a measure, that they are as it were affraid of them, and consequently are rather apt to oblige and court, than anger and displease them. They always do what lies in their Power to procure their Affections, saluting them by the familiar Titles of <HI>Mosci Panowie Bracia;</HI> that is, <HI>Gratioss Domini Fratres;</HI> which is the greatest Demonstration of real (or at least pretended) Friendship and Equality imaginable. These Titles being omitted in the Year 1667. there arose great Disturban∣ces for want of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intended Limitation of Votes like to pro∣duce a bad Effect.</NOTE> King <HI>Casimir</HI> observing the great Abuses that spring from every little Gentleman's pretended Privilege to fit in the little <HI>Diets,</HI> order'd that none should have a Vote there, in electing a <HI>Deputy</HI> or <HI>Nuncio,</HI> but such only as had at least two Hundred Crowns a Year. whereupon the <HI>Palatin</HI> of <HI>Posnania</HI> offering to put this Law in Execution in his Province, was not only affronted, but also narrowly escap'd with his Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deputies awe the King and Senate.</NOTE> These <HI>Deputies</HI> which depend on the free Nomination of the <HI>minor</HI> Gentry, in their respective Provinces, by their superiour Number, keep likewise the King and Senate in a great Dependance on them in the great <HI>Diet,</HI> since they can do nothing, nor con∣clude the least Matter without the free Con∣sent and Approbation of these <HI>Deputies.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of Disunion in the <HI>Diet.</HI></NOTE> This great Dependance of all the three Or∣ders of the Republick on one another should, one would think, cause the greatest Union between them, and make them to have but one common Interest to agree in their Assemblies to all the Articles that tend to the publick Good; but on the contrary, Self-Interest, and the excessive Liberty and Privilege, not only of every Order of the Republick, but also of every individual Member of the <HI>Diet,</HI> produces another-guess Kind of Effect, for certainly there is no Assembly in <HI>Europe</HI> more subject to Disorders, more distracted by Ca∣bals and Factions, and in fine, more corrupt∣ed by Bribery and base Practices, which is the Reason that the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> seldom concludes upon what they sit and deliberate about, tho' it should be of the greatest Im∣portance imaginable.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fomented by the Empire and <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> All these Intrigues and Mismanagements are generally fomented by the two powerful Factions of the Houses of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Bourbon.</HI> Every one knows the great Advantages the Emperours have had when they have main∣tain'd a good Correspondence or Confedera∣cy with the <HI>Poles</HI> against their common Ene∣my the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> And on the other Side, it is the <HI>French</HI> Interest to prevent and oppose such Correspondence, and endeavour to render all Means ineffectual which might otherwise favour the Emperor to enlarge his Dominions. Hereupon the <HI>Poles</HI> are so weaksighted, that they never reflect that neither the Emperour, nor the <HI>French</HI> King have any Kindness for them, but only make
<PB N="106" REF="59"/>
Use of them as Instruments, the better to accomplish their Designs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What pro∣motes fo∣reign Fa∣ctions.</NOTE> There is nothing that can promote or fa∣vour Foreign Factions more than the unli∣mited Prerogatives of each Member of the <HI>Diet,</HI> for the King, <HI>Senators,</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> have all equal Voices and equal Power in their Affirmative or Negative Votes; and Affairs are not concluded or agreed upon by Plurality of Voices, but universal Consent of all the three Orders, and the free Approba∣tion of every Member of the <HI>Diet</HI> in particu∣lar; so that if but one Person only, who has a lawful Vote, thinks fit to refuse his Consent to what all the rest have agreed to, he alone can interrupt their Proceedings, and annihilate their Suffrages: Nay, what is yet more extravagant, if, for Example, there were Thirty Articles or Bills to pass, and they all unanimously agreed to Nine and Twenty, yet if but one <HI>Deputy</HI> disapprov'd of the Thirtieth, not only that, but also the other Nine and Twenty are void and of no Force; and this because all the Articles at first propos'd have not pass'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Members not to give Reason for Dissent to any Bill.</NOTE> Hence say they, the <HI>Diet</HI> can make no Law without its having been concluded by their <HI>Concludere Comitia,</HI> or Breaking up of the <HI>Di∣et.</HI> They understand likewise, that all the Points propos'd are to be unanimously agreed upon, which nevertheless happens but very seldom; for most commonly some Factious Person or other, having perhaps been brib'd or otherwise byass'd, will protest against their Proceedings, and who consequently oftentimes prefers his own private Interest to the publick

Good of his Country. Moreover their Li∣berty extends so far, that this corrupted Member is not oblig'd by Law, to give any Reason for his said Refusal, but is only to say after their usual Manner, <HI>Nie pos Volam; It is not my Pleasure that it shall be so.</HI> Where∣upon he immediately withdraws from out of the <HI>Diet,</HI> and most commonly retires into the Country for Fear of being either kill'd or abus'd (as it often happens such People are) by some desperate Member of the <HI>Diet.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Easie Mat∣ter to an∣nul the Pro∣jects of the <HI>Diet.</HI></NOTE> Thns <HI>SIR,</HI> you may plainly perceive how easie a Matter it is for any Foreign Prince to interrupt all the Projects of this <HI>Diet,</HI> if they seem in any wise to move against his Inte∣rest. If <HI>Poland</HI> be in Peace, and has a mind to declare War against any Nation contrary to the <HI>French</HI> Interest, the <HI>French Pistoles</HI> can easily find some <HI>Senator</HI> or <HI>Deputy</HI> to oppose this Design. Or if by the Heat and Resolu∣tion of some great Men, War be denounc'd, the <HI>French</HI> King can never fail of somebody to break their Ways and Means of raising Mo∣ney to carry it on, as he effectually did in the War the late King had against the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> Then on the other side, if the <HI>Poles</HI> are actually in War with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI> which is for the Emperours Interest, the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> will never want some Christianly dispos'd Bishop, or some other Member to perswade or oblige the <HI>Diet</HI> to continue the War as long as it agrees with the Affairs of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and this un∣der Pretence of serving God and the Aposto∣lick <HI>See.</HI> This appears sufficiently in this pre∣sent
<PB N="108" REF="60"/>
War, for the <HI>Poles</HI> having been ex∣treamly fatigu'd and impoverish'd by the continu'd and fatal Interruptions of the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> for near these fifteen Years, do all no doubt wish for a Peace, and have propos'd it in every <HI>Diet</HI> for several Years, ever since the Siege of <HI>Vienna:</HI> But notwithstanding either thro their own Disorders, or the <HI>Austrian</HI> Faction, they could never yet accomplish their Design. Thus the <HI>Austrian</HI> Party keeps them in a tedious War, and the <HI>French</HI> prevents them from carrying it on with Vi∣gour, insomuch that between these two, that Nation is almost ruin'd, since on one Side they are hinder'd from making Peace to remedy the prodigious Desolations made upon them; and on the other, prevented from raising Money sufficient to carry the War into the Country of their Inva∣ders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Free∣dom of Speech there.</NOTE> Every Member of the <HI>Diet,</HI> after having obtain'd Leave of their <HI>Marshal,</HI> who can only stop their Mouths, has a Right to speak and harangue there as long as he plea∣ses: Nay, can say what he will, for they often abuse one another, and affront their King to his Face, branding him with the infamous Ti∣tles of <HI>Perjur'd, Ʋnjust,</HI> and the like. They often likewise threaten both him and his Chil∣dren, when perhaps they have the least Rea∣son. The Occasion of this is generally in that they come drunk into the <HI>Diet▪</HI> and con∣sequently talk only as the Spirit moves, ei∣ther good or bad. Nay, you shall have some of these Fuddle-caps talk Nonsense for two or three Hours together, trespassing on the
<PB N="109" REF="60"/>
Patience of the soberer Sort with a railing, carping, injurious, and ill digested Dis∣course, without any bodies ever daring to interrupt them, tho' they spin it out never so long, for if the <HI>Marshal</HI> himself should then presume to bid 'em hold their Tongues, they would infallibly dissolve the <HI>Diet,</HI> by prote∣sting against the Proceedings thereof; so that the prudenter Way is always to hear them out, and moreover, to shew no Dislike to the impertinent Speeches they have made.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unhappy State of the <HI>Polish</HI> Go∣vernment.</NOTE> No body but sees the unhappy State of the Government of <HI>Poland;</HI> that their Constitu∣tions and Privileges are most pernicious; that the unlimited and absolute Liberty of each Member makes all the Republick Slaves, either to the Whimsy or factious Obstinacy of one particular Man; for can there be any thing more unreasonable than that after all the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> have come from most remote Provinces with excessive Ex∣pence, to the <HI>Diet,</HI> and labour'd jointly with the King to conclude Matters for the common Benefit of the Nation, it should be in the Power of one disaffected or corrupted Person, without giving any farther Reason than his own Pleasure, to annul the Proceedings of the rest, and to dissolve the <HI>Diet</HI> at a Juncture especially, when there is the greatest Occasion for their Concurrence?</P>
<P>Thus <HI>SIR,</HI> you may perceive that Affairs of the greatest Consequence depend not only on the prudent Deliberations of sober Men,
<PB N="110" REF="61"/>
but also on the whimsical Humours of the senseless or deprav'd. This excessive Liber∣ty of every private Man shews that both the Nation and the <HI>Diet</HI> have none at all.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of concluding Matters by unanimous Consent.</NOTE> This Constitution of concluding Matters in the <HI>Diet,</HI> rather by universal Consent than Plurality of Voices, was establish'd to de∣prive their Kings of all Means and Opportu∣nities of ever becoming absolute, for they imagin'd it was morally impossible (as it re∣ally is) that whatever Interest or Authority the King might get in the Country, that he should ever so far prevail as to bring all the Members of the <HI>Diet</HI> (for he might have the Majority) to consent to any Article or Bill which might any wise be injurious to the Na∣tion. But on the other hand, observing the many bad Consequences that usually attend, and must still necessarily follow, such Consti∣tutions, they once propos'd to decide their Af∣fairs by the two Thirds of the Voices, yet which they could never agree in, by reason that the greatest Part of them being over∣fond of their Liberties, were loath by these means to consent to part with them; and so that Proposal had no Effect.</P>

they rather enlarge and encrease 'em as often as they elect their Kings.

it is not only infamous and scandalous to his Person, but also prejudicial to his Po∣sterity that breaks up a <HI>Diet;</HI> as also not a little dangerous to his Life, to irritate and disobey so powerful a Body; for they are commonly very liberal in their Passion, of bestowing several Slashes of a Scymitar on any ill-natur'd corrupted Member that opposes the Interest of his Country, tho' in Reality he has the Law on his Side. It is certain therefore that where any Person withstands the rest in the <HI>Diet,</HI> it is either because the King has not sufficiently employ'd his Au∣thority to pacifie him, or Policy to win him with a small Present; or else by reason that he does not care they should agree; or last∣ly, because there is a considerable Party of <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> that support, or rather employ him to protest against an Act that they do not think for their Interest to let pass. It is a common Practice, where any of the Members of the <HI>Senate</HI> have any particu∣lar Advantage, by opposing the <HI>Diets</HI> Pro∣ceedings, not to expose themselves either to the Hatred or Anger of that numerous Body, but rather to sacrifice some private Deputy to their Fury, who for a small Summ of Money will come into the <HI>Diet</HI> and declare in plain Terms, without any manner of Reason, <HI>that it is not his Pleasure that such a Matter, then in Agitation, should pass.</HI> Whereupon he imme∣diately withdraws, if he can, into the Coun∣try for Security. But generally these Opposi∣tions are never practis'd where the publick Interest of the Nation is concern'd, as ap∣pears in the raising the last Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="62"/>
by the <HI>Turks;</HI> where the <HI>Poles</HI> finding that the Loss of that City would turn be very much to their Prejudice, march'd directly under their then reigning King, <HI>John</HI> III. to the Relief of it, which they soon effected to their im∣mortal Honour and Glory. 'Tis true, that it is not an easie Matter to bring the <HI>Poles</HI> into the Field; but when once they are got together into a considerable Body, their Courage and undaunted Resolutions render them invincible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> Reason.</NOTE> Secondly, The Order of their Govern∣ment, and their Courage and Resolution does not so much contribute towards their Preservation, as the Envy and Jealousies of their Neighbours among themselves; for when the late King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> made War with <HI>Poland,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> came to assist the <HI>Poles,</HI> and at the same Time the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> made a consi∣derable Diversion in <HI>Suedeland.</HI> When the <HI>Tartars</HI> likewise declare War against <HI>Poland,</HI> most commonly either the Emperour or <HI>Mos∣covite</HI> come to its Relief; or else make great Diversions on their Sides; for as it is the Interest of the Princes their Neighbours, not to let them grow to that exorbitant Power which they had formerly; so it is not at all for their Benefit to let them perish; for whoever could be able to conquer <HI>Poland,</HI> and unite it to his own Dominions, would quick∣ly be too powerful for all the rest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>III.</HI> Reason.</NOTE> Thirdly, The <HI>Poles,</HI> besides this, can the easier conserve their Dominions by reason
<PB N="114" REF="63"/>
that they have no strong Forts or Castles to shelter their Enemies, where they happen to make any Progress in their Country; yet I verily believe that an Army of fifty Thou∣sand well-disciplin'd Men would at present conquer the whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> tho' at the same Time I am of Opinion that an Hundred Thousand could not be able to keep it. <HI>Carolus Custavus,</HI> King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> with about Forty Thousand Men, entirely subdu'd <HI>Poland</HI> in less than two Years Time, yet when he began to encroach too much up∣on their Constitutions and Liberties, the <HI>Po∣lish</HI> Gentry join'd unanimously together, and soon drove the <HI>Suedes</HI> out of the <HI>Kingdom.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> in numerous Bodies make fre∣quent Incursions into this open Country, but still as soon as they have loaded themselves with their Booty, they make all possible Haste away. The Loss of <HI>Caminiec</HI> makes the <HI>Poles</HI> admire at their own Policy in ha∣ving no strong Towns, for they say, had not that been so well fortify'd, it had not serv'd for Shelter to a strong Garrison of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> at their Doors. Insomuch that it may be observ'd that Forts and Ca∣stles which we count our greatest Security, would inevitably be the Ruine of the <HI>Poles;</HI> they being not skill'd in besieging Towns, and moreover, having no good Artillery, In∣geniers, Ammunition, or other Necessaries, since they never were, nor ever will be able to retake <HI>Caminiec,</HI> tho it is a Place of no ex∣traordinary Strength, and for my Part I ve∣rily believe that if it should be surrender'd to them, they would quickly rase and demo∣lish it.</P>

I may take notice that the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Leopol,</HI> tho he can call and hold his <HI>Synod</HI> a-part, yet is he altogether subject in Spirituals to the Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna,</HI> or Primate of <HI>Poland.</HI> The general Convocati∣on is for the most part conven'd every third Year at <HI>Petricovia, Lanschet,</HI> or <HI>Lowitz,</HI> whereof the <HI>minor</HI> Clergy, as in <HI>England,</HI> are admitted by their <HI>Deputies</HI> or Representa∣tives.</P>

The Judges of the former are chosen out of the Prime Nobility, and those of the latter out of the Nobility in general of every <HI>Palatinate,</HI> at the several particular Conventions, and in the Beginning of every <HI>Interregnum.</HI> All these Courts cease three Weeks before the Assembly for Election meets, and after the Election, they sit again to the very Day of the Coronation.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="64"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiasti∣cal Courts and their Jurisdicti∣on.</NOTE> The other Courts of Justice in <HI>Poland</HI> are either Ecclesiastical, Civil or Military. The Ecclesiastical, as in other Nations, are alto∣gether in the hands of the Bishops, who have Each their Chancellor, Register, &amp;c. from whom Appeals may be made to the Arch∣bishops; and even from the Archbishop of <HI>Leopol</HI> to him of <HI>Gnesna,</HI> who is the Popes Legat Born, and Primate and Metropolitan of all <HI>Poland:</HI> Nevertheless, from him Ap∣peals lye to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> These Judge according to the Canons and Customs of the Church; and the Civil Magistrates are ob∣lig'd to be Assisting to them in the Execution of their Sentences as often as they shall be so requir'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of Nuncia∣ture.</NOTE> To the Ecclesiastical Courts belongs the Court of <HI>Nunciature</HI> held by the Popes <HI>Nuncio,</HI> for that purpose always residing in <HI>Poland.</HI> However, before he can have any Jurisdicti∣on, he must have presented the King and the Principal Ministers of State, with the Apo∣stolic Brief of his <HI>Nunciature.</HI></P>

Two of these Tribunals are for the Kingdom, and one for the Great Dutchy. Those for the Kingdom keep their Session Six Months at <HI>Petricovia</HI> in Low-<HI>Poland;</HI> and the other Six at <HI>Lublin</HI> in High-<HI>Poland:</HI> That for the Great
<PB N="117" REF="64"/>
Dutchy is alternatively one year at <HI>Vilna,</HI> and another either at <HI>Novogrodec</HI> or <HI>Minski.</HI> They all consist of so many Judges both Ecclesiasti∣cal and Civil, chosen out of every <HI>Palatinate,</HI> the former once in four years, and the latter once in two. Judgment is pronounced here by Plurality of Voices: but where Matters are purely Ecclesiastical, there ought to be as many of the Clergy as the Laity. The Causes here are heard in Order; for three days are allow'd to enter all that come; and whatever are not enter'd within that time cannot be ad∣judg'd that sitting. A Man that has a Trial in these Courts, may be said to have all the Nation for his Judges, <HI>Deputies</HI> both Ecclesi∣astical and Temporal being sent thither for that purpose from all Parts of the King∣dom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Senate <HI>and</HI> Green-Cloth.</NOTE> The <HI>Senate</HI> also Judges of Civil or Crimi∣nal Matters without Appeal: As do likewise the Great-<HI>Marshals</HI> in all Cases relating to the King's Officers; And the Great Chancel∣lors in matters of Appeal to the Court which they have only Cognisance of. But the <HI>Marshal's</HI> Jurisdiction extends over all Mer∣chants, and Strangers; both who find but little Justice done them in <HI>Poland</HI> when they have occasion for it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exchequer Courts.</NOTE> Also there are two Exchequer Courts for the Revenue, one held at <HI>Radom</HI> in High-<HI>Poland,</HI> and the other at <HI>Vilna.</HI> These Courts seldom sit above a Fortnight or Three Weeks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentry-Courts not free from <HI>Appeal.</HI></NOTE> Those that are not exempt from Appeals, are the Courts of the Gentry and Commo∣nalty in every <HI>Palatinate;</HI> which are by no means to have any of the Clergy for Judges.
<PB N="118" REF="65"/>
Those for the Gentry are either the Courts of Land-Judicature, or those of the <HI>Starostas,</HI> and are more, or fewer in number, accord∣ing to the Extent of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> where they are held.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Land-Judicature with its Judges.</NOTE> The Courts of Land-Judicature have one Judge, an Associate, and a Natory, or Head-Clerk to Try Causes, and Administer all Civil Ju∣stice; in some Places four, in others six times a year; and in others once a Month. The Courseof these Courts can only be interrupted by the Death of any of their Judges, by the <HI>Diet,</HI> or by the general Meeting of the <HI>Pala∣tines</HI> and Magistrates; which last is every Au∣tumn, to hear Appeals from Inferiour Courts. The Towns where the Gentry sit are in great number; and it must be observ'd, that none who have Lands or Goods within each Juris∣diction, can be made to Appear at a Court where they have none.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vice-Cham∣berlains Court.</NOTE> The immediate Appeal from these Courts is to the Vice-Chamberlain of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> who either by himself or his Deputy, the Chamberlain of that <HI>District,</HI> restores all that have been Dispossess'd, and ascertains all Bounds and Limits of Lands. This is as it were his whole Jurisdiction. But where there is any Contest between the King and any of the Gentry in this Kind, then at their re∣quest <NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissio∣ners to take Appeals.</NOTE>Commissioners are appointed out of the <HI>Senate</HI> to inspect the matter disputed, and to do Justice therein. Likewise where the Difference is between the King and a Clergy∣man, Commissioners are order'd; but there the Bishop of the Diocess Claims the Nomina∣tion of one or more of them. When any of the
<PB N="119" REF="65"/>
Officers of the Courts of Land-Judicature die, the King cannot Name others, till the <HI>District</HI> to which they belong'd, have chosen Four out of the House-keepers; but then he may pitch upon One for each Election. This Office being once obtain'd, it cannot be forfeited but by a Higher Promotion, or Male Admi∣nistration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentries Criminal Courts.</NOTE> The other Courts for the Gentry are those that take cognizance of Criminal Cases, whereof there is one only in every <HI>Starosta∣ship,</HI> call'd <HI>Sudy Grodskie:</HI> Where either the <HI>Starosta</HI> himself, or his Lieutenant-Criminal, Administers Justice in his Castle, or some other publick Place, at least every Six Weeks. He likewise has Cognisance of Civil Causes be∣tween such as have no Lands, and such For∣reigners as come to Trade here.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Starostas</HI> Power and Office.</NOTE> He is also the Executive Minister of all Sentences pronounc'd, and likewise a sole Conservator of the Peace within his Terri∣tories. He is oblig'd by himself or his Offi∣cers, to see all Publick Executions perform'd.</P>
<P>The Courts of the Commonalty are either in Cities or Villages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Courts of Commonal∣ty in Cities.</NOTE> In Cities Justice is Administred by the <HI>Sca∣bins,</HI> Town-Hall, or Judg-Advocate. The <HI>Scabins</HI> have cognisance of all Capital Offen∣ces, and Criminal Matters, the Town-Hall of all Civil Cases; to which likewise the Gen∣try are subject; and the Judg-Advocate of Offences committed by Soldiers. Civil Mat∣ters of small Moment are determin'd solely by the Governour of the City, but which are
<PB N="120" REF="66"/>
subject to Appeal to the Town-Hall, and thence to the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Villages.</NOTE> In Villages the Commonalty are subject to <HI>Scabins,</HI> being the Kings Officers, and to <HI>Scul∣tets</HI> or Peculiar Lords; from which last lies no Appeal. Here Justice is almost Arbitrary, except in Criminal Cases. The <HI>Scultets</HI> are Hereditary Judges. The Execution of all Sentences in Cities and Towns, is in the hands of its own Magistrates, though in some cases they are forc'd to beg Assistance from the <HI>Starostas.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Officers and Magi∣strates of Plebeian Courts.</NOTE> The Officers and Magistrates of the Ple∣beian Courts are some nam'd by their Pecu∣liar Lords, and some Elected by their Fellow Citizens, except in <HI>Cracow</HI> only, where the <HI>Palatine</HI> has a Right of Choosing the Magi∣strates, though he has not the same Power to dis-place them after they are once chosen; for they are to continue their Office for Life, unless they forfeit it by Infamy or Inability.</P>
<P>Out of the XXIV (composing the Council or <HI>Senate</HI> of <HI>Cracow)</HI> the <HI>Palatine</HI> every year deputes Eight with the Title and Power of <HI>Presidents.</HI> He also Names the Judge and <HI>Scabins</HI> by the <HI>Magdeburg</HI> Laws, though these in other Cities are chosen by the Council.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Military Jurisdicti∣on.</NOTE> The Military Jurisdiction of <HI>Poland</HI> is wholly in the hands of the King, or his Ge∣nerals, although the <HI>Palatines</HI> and <HI>Castellans</HI> who generally Accompany his Majesty to the Wars, retain their Authority over their re∣spective Inferiours; but where those are Re∣fractory, a Court-Marshal Adjusts the De∣bate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin, Progress, and present State of Laws.</NOTE> As for the Laws of <HI>Poland,</HI> it is on all hands agreed, that it had none till the time of <HI>Casimir</HI> the Great, and then but very few made by him; altho it is certain, that the <HI>Poles</HI> hadlong before been Christians, and were well enough vers'd in the Human-Learning, yet was there never any Law or Statute of any Prince com∣mitted to Writing; but that People were contented to be govern'd by the Customs and Manners of their Ancestors, handed down to them from Father to Son. <HI>Casimir</HI> III. there∣fore (call'd the Great from his prudent Ad∣ministration) observing the disadvantages his Kingdom labour'd under by the <HI>Germans,</HI> who then frequently came into <HI>Poland</HI> on ac∣count of Trade, receiv'd the <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws (now call'd <HI>Magdeburg</HI>-Laws, from the City of <HI>Saxony</HI> whence they were taken) by which <HI>Poland</HI> is at this day principally govern'd, al∣though the Gentry have many peculiar Cu∣stoms, and some Statutes which have been
<PB N="122" REF="67"/>
since made: And which in the Time of <HI>Sigis∣mundus Augustus,</HI> being compiled into one Volume by Learned Men, were entitled the <HI>Statutes of the Kingdom;</HI> and since (some having been Approv'd and Augmented, and others Chang'd and Alter'd in several <HI>Diets)</HI> have obtain'd the Name of <HI>Constitutions of</HI> Po∣land; to which nevertheless all that Kingdom is not Subject, <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Volhynia</HI> obser∣ving its own Laws. <HI>Prussia</HI> likewise, both <HI>Regal</HI> and <HI>Ducal,</HI> has a Municipal Law of its own, commonly stil'd <HI>the Law of Culm;</HI> from which notwithstanding Three Cities are Ex∣empt, <HI>viz. Elbing, Bransberg,</HI> and <HI>Fraumberg,</HI> all which make use of the Laws of <HI>Lansberg.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Punish∣ments in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> The Punishments in <HI>Poland</HI> are various, and differ only according to the Quality of the Crimes, and not of the Persons; for a Thief is to be hang'd of what degree soever he be, and Capital Offenders of all other Kinds and Qualities are to be Beheaded, ex∣cept in Notorious Villanies, where the Of∣fender is commonly broke on the Wheel, or else Tortur'd by cutting off two Thongs, or long Pieces out of the Skin of his Back. A Nobleman is sometimes punish'd by forfeit∣ing half his Estate to the King, and the rest to an Informer; and sometimes by Imprison∣ment only.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of chastising Servants.</NOTE> Masters also have a Power of Chastising their Servants; which they do after this man∣ner: If the Servant they are about to Punish be a <HI>Polish</HI> Gentleman, then they make him lye down on his Belly on a Carpet spread on
<PB N="123" REF="67"/>
the Ground, or upon a Stool, when another Gentleman-Servant lays him on unmercifully on the Back, with a Rope or Stick, giving him as many Blows and Lashes, as the Master who is then present, orders. After which, he that is beaten embraces the Knees of him that had commanded him to be Beat, and sa∣lutes him with the good-natur'd Title of <HI>Be∣nefactor.</HI> This Discipline seems a little too severe; but however, the Temper of these People makes it necessary. The Peasant-Ser∣vants are punish'd after the same manner, only with this difference, that they have no Carpet spread under them. Some of the for∣mer sort think it an Honour to be so lash'd; which Honour they always receive liberally as often as they deserve it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No Disgrace to the Gen∣ty to be thus beat.</NOTE> This Custom of the <HI>Poles</HI> in punishing their Gentlemen-Servants so rigidly, ought not much to be wonder'd at, if it be consider'd, that they may serve in the meanest Offices without derogating from the Nobility of their Birth, or incapacitating themselves for the Highest Preferments.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notifie their Arri∣val and how re∣ceiv'd.</NOTE> Before any Ambassadours arrive, they are to send Notice of their coming to the Archbi∣shop of <HI>Gnesna,</HI> who is to appoint them Lodg∣ings at a Distance from the City, and to as∣sign them a <HI>Polish</HI> Gentleman, whose Business is rather to observe their Conduct, and to acquaint the <HI>Diet</HI> therewith, than to do them either any Service or Honour. But however these Rules are but seldom observ'd, for Princes Ambassadours now generally live publickly at <HI>Warsaw.</HI> A Gentleman, 'tis
<PB N="130" REF="71"/>
true, is still appointed to be always with them, whose chiefest Business is to prevent their corrupting any with Money; but this Precaution is notwithstanding now become useless, since Avarice bears so great a Sway in <HI>Poland,</HI> that even the Fidelity which a <HI>Po∣lish</HI> Gentleman ows his Country, cannot withstand the Charms of a Thousand Crowns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Embassa∣dors from the Repub∣lick.</NOTE> Embassadors are not only receiv'd from Foreign Princes, and their Masters Letters publickly read; but also <HI>Polish</HI> Ministers are sent at this Time from the Republick to all Neighbouring States, to answer their Embas∣sies, and to request their Amity. Here it may be observ'd, that all Embassadours or Envoys, who have had Audience of Leave be∣fore the late King's Death, are desir'd to de∣part within eight Days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caution to foreign Ministers.</NOTE> Embassadors from foreign Courts must take especial Care to secure the <HI>Diet</HI> in gene∣ral, since the bare disobliging of one particu∣lar Member may render them for ever inca∣pable of bringing their Designs about, as it hapned in the Election of <HI>Michael Wiesnowiski,</HI> where the true Reason of the Duke of <HI>New∣burg</HI>'s being excluded, was the Quarrel with the Chancellor <HI>Patz:</HI> Nevertheless it must be acknowledg'd that that Election was tumul∣tuary, the Nobility had not their free Votes, and that they were in a manner hurried away by the Violence of the Multitude, which was so great, that <HI>Prasmowski,</HI> then Primate, was forc'd to proclaim him, tho' he knew
<PB N="131" REF="71"/>
that the Republick at that Juncture had need of both a rich and valiant King, neither of which that Prince could in the least pretend to be. He was no sooner proclaim'd, but the Chancellor began to insinuate that he ow'd his Crown to him, nor was it a difficult Task for him to impose on a Prince who was easily govern'd, and who had always shewn more good Nature than Judgment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deputies Business af∣ter this <HI>Di∣et.</HI></NOTE> After the <HI>Diet</HI> of Convocation ended, the <HI>Nuncios</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> retire to their several Countries, where they acquaint the Gentry, being a second Time assembled in their Lit∣tle Diets, of the Proceedings in this general Convocation, and particularly of the Day as∣sign'd for the Election; Whereupon the Gentry immediately begin to consult about what is proper to be propos'd in the <HI>Diet</HI> of Election, and they proceed to choose new Deputies. In <HI>Prussia</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Varmia</HI> being sole Lord Lieutenant, summons all these little <HI>Diets</HI> by his Mandates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diet</HI> of E∣lection.]</NOTE> The general <HI>Diet</HI> for the Election of a King, was formerly held at <HI>Petricovia,</HI> but since the joining of the Kingdom with the Great Dutchy, is always held in an open Field half a League from <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and near the Village of <HI>Vola,</HI> and is not to continue by the Laws above six Weeks. The Crown-Treasurer, at the Charges of the Republick, builds there a large Booth or Hall with Boards, not unlike Booths in our <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair: The Name the <HI>Poles</HI> give to this Place,
<PB N="132" REF="72"/>
is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hartknoch lib. 2. cap. 1. p. 295.</NOTE><HI>Szopa,</HI> signifying a cover'd Room against the Injuries of Weather. It has but three Doors to go in at, and they fortifie it round with a broad and deep Ditch. When this Place is thus finish'd by the Care of the aforesaid Of∣ficer, and the Day fix'd for the <HI>Diets</HI> convening is arriv'd, the <HI>Senators</HI> and Nobility go in great Order to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> where they pray God to assist them in the Election of a King, who may have all the Qualities necessary to defend the Church, and protect the Republick. Then they go to wait on the Queen Dowager, to condole the Death of the deceas'd King her Husband, the Primate speak∣ing for the Senate, and the last Nuncio-Marshal for the Deputies, who are then answer'd in the Queen's Name by her Chancellor. After which they march to the <HI>Szopa,</HI> where the Nobility elect their Marshal or Speaker by Majority of Votes, who after being chosen, takes the usual Oath, which runs thus, <HI>That he will discharge his Office faithfully, receive no Bribes, keep private Correspondence with none of the Competitors, and will not subscribe a Schedule of a free Election without the Knowledge and Ap∣probation of the Republick.</HI> After this he goes to wait on the <HI>Senators</HI> for their Approbation. It must be understood that the <HI>Senators</HI> only sit in the <HI>Szopa,</HI> for the <HI>Deputies</HI> have their Session in the open Field, which they call their <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 2. cap. 1. p. eadem.</NOTE><HI>Rota Equestris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="72"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Pro∣ceedings therein.</NOTE> The first thing that the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Nun∣cios,</HI> or deputed Gentry, do in this <HI>Diet,</HI> af∣ter establishing of the <HI>Kaptur,</HI> is to take a mutual Oath on their Knees, administred by the Prmate, to a strict Union and Intelligence among themselves for the common Interest of the Nation: Next, not to acknowledge any for their King, but him that is lawfully elected by the unanimous Consent and who must withal swear to preserve inviolable, the Rights and Privileges of the Republick; and they moreover promise mutually, that he who will act otherwise, shall be deem'd and declar'd an Enemy to his Country. Like∣wise they reciprocally promise not to give their Voices for an Election, nor to enter in∣to any Agreement with any of the <HI>Candidates</HI> or their Embassadors, till all the Irregularities or Disorders, either in the Kingdom or the Great Dutchy, be first consider'd and re∣dress'd. They annul all the Decrees of the Tribunals, and even the Statutes of Kings that are found to entrench on their Liberties: They declare that all other Judgments pro∣nounc'd before the Publication of the <HI>Inter∣regnum,</HI> shall be valid: They set up a new Court of Justice call'd <HI>Kaptur,</HI> which is to Defend the Country, Coin Money, Raise Soldiers, and for Maintaining of the Laws. They give Orders that no Body shall come to the <HI>Diet</HI> with Fire-Arms, nor bring any Strangers along with them: They cause the Generals to take on Oath before Commissio∣ners to discharge the Trust repos'd in them, faithfully to employ their Forces against the
<PB N="134" REF="73"/>
Enemies of the Republick, and to defend the Frontiers, thereby to secure the Honour and Liberties of the Kingdom. They oblige them also to swear to assert the publick In∣terest in Case of Sedition or Rebellion, to restrain Soldiers from injuring any Person, to receive Money neither from Clergy nor Laity, and to prevent their Soldiers from receiving any. And lastly, they forbid them to advance with their Troops into the Heart of the Kingdom, and more especially to come <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Piasecius ad An. 1632. p. 530.</NOTE>near the <HI>Diet</HI> for Fear of being forc'd to an Election against their free Will: And providing the Republick should be attack'd by such a Force, as the Army were not strong enough to resist, then they declare, that from that very Minute they summon all the Nobility to meet together without Delay, at the Time and Place which the Primate and his Council shall appoint; that the Review of the Soldiers rais'd in general by the Re∣publick, or in particular by the <HI>Palatinaetes,</HI> shall be made in the Camp; that each <HI>Palati∣nate</HI> shall take care to pay its own Troops, and not disband any but such as the general <HI>Diet</HI> shall think fit to dismiss. They forbid the Treasurers of the Crown or Great Dutchy, to give out any Money without Knowledge and Approbation of the Archbi∣shop and his Council, but only for Payment of the Troops of the Republick: They order that skilful and honest Persons shall be sent to visit the Salt-Works, and to regulate all Re∣parations that shall be found necessary there;
<PB N="135" REF="73"/>
and in the last Place, that the <HI>Deputies</HI> of cer∣tain Cities shall not be admitted to the <HI>Diet,</HI> till they have sufficiently prov'd their Right to come thither. In short, the <HI>Poles</HI> in this <HI>Diet</HI> take all the Measures and Care imagina∣ble to secure their Frontiers, maintain the Kingdom in Peace and Quietness, to settle a good Intelligence among themselves; and lastly, to prevent Bribery or any private In∣terest in any of the Members of the <HI>Diet</HI> that might tend to hinder a free and unanimous Election.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exorbitan∣cies exa∣min'd, and Embassa∣dors re∣ceiv'd.</NOTE> Matters being thus dispos'd, they immedi∣ately proceed to the Election, examining first, the <HI>Exorbitances,</HI> that is to say, the Disorders and Excesses committed during the last Reign, to the end that they may prevent the like for the future. These Exorbitances are not examin'd by the whole Session, either of the <HI>Senators</HI> or <HI>Deputies,</HI> but by a certain Number assign'd out of both, who sit a-Mornings in the Castle of <HI>Warsaw.</HI> Then the <HI>Diet</HI> gives Audience to the Ambassadors, both of those Princes that pretend to the Crown, and those that recommend others to it, sending first, a great Train of Coaches to wait on them to the <HI>Rota Eque∣stris,</HI> whither it must be understood that on this Occasion the <HI>Senate</HI> goes.</P>
<P>When these Embassadors are thus sent for, the Pope's <HI>Nuncio</HI> is always preferr'd, then comes the Emperour's <HI>Embassador,</HI> next the <HI>French,</HI> and after these the <HI>Spanish:</HI> But since the <HI>Diet</HI> of Election conven'd at <HI>Warsaw</HI> after the Death of <HI>Sigismundus Augustus,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="74"/>
when the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassador demanded Audi∣ence before the King of <HI>France,</HI> who not∣withstanding was preferr'd, <HI>Spain</HI> has sent no Embassador on this Account into <HI>Poland;</HI> for as for Don <HI>Pedro Ronquillos,</HI> who was pre∣sent at the <HI>Diet</HI> of Election of <HI>John</HI> III. he durst never assume either the Title or Quali∣ty of Embassador, for Fear he should be forc'd to give Place to the Embassador of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Receiving them.</NOTE> The Manner of receiving these Embassa∣dors is this: The Pope's Legate is intro∣duc'd by a certain Number of the Ecclesiasti∣cal and Lay-Senators, as likewise by the Marshal of the Deputies, and an assign'd Number out of their Body. The <HI>Inter-Rex</HI> arising out of his Chair, moves two or three Steps to meet him, and places him on his Right-Hand. The secular Embassadors are introduc'd by some of the Lay-Senators and Deputies only. The Emperour's Minister is plac'd by them between the Great Marshal and the Nuncio-Marshal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What re∣quisite in forreign Ministers.</NOTE> When the Embassadors receive Audience, they make their Harangue in <HI>Latin,</HI> to which the Archbishop that presides, answers for the <HI>Senators,</HI> and the <HI>Nuncio-Marshal</HI> for the Nobility. It is absolutely necessary for all Ministers that have any Interests of their Masters to carry on in the <HI>Diet,</HI> to be not only eloquent, but liberal and generous, that by their Treats, Feasts, and chiefly their Money, they may gain or purchase the Good Will and Suffrages of the <HI>Senate</HI> and Gentry. It is so essentially requisite for Em∣bassadors
<PB N="137" REF="74"/>
to make a great Figure, keep an open Table, spend a vast deal of Money, and to make considerable Presents, that if the <HI>Diet</HI> do but in the least suspect any Avarice or Niggardliness in them, they will presently impute it to the Poverty of the Prince that sent them, which would prove no small Ob∣struction, either to his Election or Interest in Behalf of any body else. Embassadors must likewise take more than ordinary Care to keep in with the Clergy; first, by oblig∣ing the Bishops, because they bear great Sway in the <HI>Diet,</HI> and next the Priests and Fryars, they having no less Influence and Authority over the People. But however Presents are not to be made them in gross, but by little and little, lest they fly off when they ex∣pect no farther Recompence; for the <HI>Poles</HI> generally think themselves oblig'd to serve you, not for what they have already receiv'd, but because they are still in Hopes of receiv∣ing more. They are all likewise apt to neg∣lect your Interest, and will sometimes take Money from another Prince or his Embassa∣dor, to vote against you. The late King is accus'd of taking Money of the Emperor, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and of the Duke of <HI>New∣bourg,</HI> to employ it in their several Interests in the Election; but however, he did more wisely to make use of it himself to get to be elected, in which we find he had good Suc∣cess.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diet</HI> pro∣ceeds to E∣lection.</NOTE> After the Embassadors have thus had Au∣dience, and that all other Matters are settled in the Republick, they proceed to the Electi∣on
<PB N="138" REF="75"/>
of a King, but first they implore the As∣sistance of the Holy Ghost, by singing the <HI>Veni Creator:</HI> Then they proceed to give their Votes, and communicate them to each other, when if they are unanimous for one Candidate, the Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna,</HI> or Bishop that presides in his Place, demands thrice if the Grievances and Exorbitancies are redress'd; which being answer'd in the Affirmative, he immediately proclaims the King Elect, which is likewise done at the same Time by the <HI>Marshals</HI> of the Crown and the Great Dutchy, and then they all joyn in the singing of <HI>Te Deum.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further Particu∣lars there∣of.</NOTE> Here it may not be amiss to give your Lordship farther Particulars, of the manner of Election, which is this. Assoon as the Anthem is ended, the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> remove from their Places, and divide them∣selves into their several <HI>Palatinates,</HI> making so many peculiar <HI>Rota's,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna</HI> only still keeping his Seat. The Or∣ders being thus divided, the first <HI>Senator</HI> of every <HI>Palatinate,</HI> numbers their Votes; which afterwards are transmitted into a Roll, and delivered under their several Hands to the <HI>Nuncio-Marshal.</HI> All these Suffrages are then reckon'd together by the <HI>Senate</HI> in the <HI>Szopa,</HI> where if there be a Majority for any one <HI>Candidate,</HI> they labour what they can partly by Perswasion, and partly by Promi∣ses, to bring the Electors to be unanimous; for till then no King can be lawfully Pro∣claim'd: yet when there is a Division in the <HI>Diet,</HI> as most commonly it happens, the
<PB N="139" REF="75"/>
strongest Party still carries it, as it appear'd in <HI>Stephen Batori</HI>'s Cafe, and that of <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI> III. which last coming soonest into <HI>Poland,</HI> was Crown'd King at <HI>Cracow,</HI> not∣withstanding that <HI>Maximilian</HI> was proclaim'd at <HI>Warsaw</HI> by Cardinal <HI>Radzvil.</HI> It may be observ'd that the House of <HI>Austria</HI> has been put by the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> no less than thrice. First in the Person of <HI>Ernest,</HI> by the Election of <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Valois;</HI> and Secondly and Thirdly, by the Exclusion of this <HI>Maxi∣milian:</HI> And this because the <HI>Poles</HI> have a Maxim, never to Elect any Powerful Neigh∣bouring Prince for fear of being subdu'd, and brought under an Arbitrary Power. The Day after the Election all the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>De∣puties</HI> meet either in the <HI>Rota Equestris,</HI> or the Castle of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and draw up the Decree of Election, subscribing it with their several Hands; which is immediately afterwards sent to the Press to be Printed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Con∣cours at the Election and Policy to byass them.</NOTE> To the Election of a King of <HI>Poland,</HI> not only all the Gentry of the Kingdom and Great Dutchy, but likewise a great Number of Strangers from all adjacent Countries come, yet notwithstanding that, People come from all Parts of <HI>Poland;</HI> the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> only, have a lawful Vote in the Election: Nevertheless, the other Gentry Interest them∣selves either in favouring the <HI>Senators,</HI> or the Factions of the <HI>Deputies,</HI> and sometimes fall out among themselves about it, so that it is the absolute Interest of the <HI>Candidate</HI> to treat and present, not only the individual Members of the <HI>Diet,</HI> but also these Nobles,
<PB N="140" REF="76"/>
altho they have no actual Voices in the Electi∣on, for their great Number can easily favour and carry on a Faction, by threatning the Senators and Deputies, in Case they do not elect such a Prince as they propose. This was confirm'd in the Election of <HI>Michael Wi∣esnowiski,</HI> where none of the Electors thought of choosing a Piasto, and much less such a weak poor unexperienc'd Prince as this Duke was; yet the turbulent Mob of <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry soon forc'd them to elect and proclaim him King, notwithstanding, this being no free Election, they never paid him any great Deference, but undervalu'd, and were so displeas'd with him, that some say, after four Years Reign, he was poison'd by the Contrivance of the Great Men. Thus it is palpably more safe and creditable for a <HI>Candidate</HI> to purchase himself a strong Party in the <HI>Diet,</HI> and to support and back them by procuring the Af∣fection and good Will of the rest of the Gen∣try, than to rely barely on the inconstant and tumultuous Suffrage of a senseless turbu∣lent Mob, as the late King sufficiently experi∣enc'd before his Election.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualifica∣tions re∣quir'd in a Candidate.</NOTE> There are several Conditions requir'd in a Candidate, that aspires to the Crown of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> which are now past, as Constitutions of the Kingdom, for he must not be a Na∣tive (which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. Cap. 1. p. 309. to 312.</NOTE><HI>Hartknoch</HI> says he may, and which he proves by a great many Persons) nor marry'd, nor <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> Ibid. p. 431.</NOTE>present at the Election, but must be rich, and no absolute or neigh∣bouring
<PB N="141" REF="76"/>
Prince: And as for his Religion, he must ei∣ther actually be, or promise to become a <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Catholick before he can be crown'd. All this after the Death of King <HI>Michael</HI> the late Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and Duke <HI>Ernest</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> promis'd, being not willing, it seems, to lose a Crown for an exteriour Show of a Piece of Religious Ceremo∣ny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules ob∣serv'd by the <HI>Poles</HI> in Electi∣ons.</NOTE> The Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> think themselves so great, and so equal in Respect to each other, that they do not willingly consent to elect a <HI>Piasto</HI> or Native to a Crown, which their Birth gave them a parallel Right to. They besides think it a great Advantage to their Nation to choose a forreign and rich Prince, that they may make more Alliances abroad, and oblige such Kings to bring all their Ef∣fects with them to enrich the Kingdom. They are for an unmarry'd Prince, that they may have the Opportunity of matching him, and so to strengthen their Alliances that Way. They care not to elect a neighbour∣ing Prince, for fear he should become abso∣lute by his adjoyning Force. But however these, like their other Constitutions, have not been always observ'd; for the only Maxim they have hitherto kept inviolable, is not to elect any Prince but a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, for the late King was both a <HI>Piasto</HI> and marry'd before he was elected: 'Tis true, they would have had his Queen divorc'd from him, that they might have marry'd him to King <HI>Micha∣el</HI>'s Queen Dowager <HI>Eleonora,</HI> at present Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> but the Af∣fection
<PB N="142" REF="77"/>
the King always bore to his Queen, in Conjunction with her own Intrigues among the <HI>Senators,</HI> soon broke this Design. They have also sometimes elected absolute and neighbouring Princes, as the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> the King of <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Transilvania;</HI> but then this Constitution was not in Force, being on∣ly made of latter Days, for they are now re∣solv'd to admit of no such Election hereafter: So that at present a Prince must be very rich to purchase the Votes of so many Hundreds that compose the <HI>Diet,</HI> and to treat the Gen∣try in general: And besides, must have many Heroick and Warlike Qualities, and a great Reputation in the World, to obtain the Crown of <HI>Poland:</HI> Insomuch that before he can be elected and crown'd, it must necessari∣ly cost him several Hundreds of Thousand Pounds Sterling: And moreover, the vast Sums that all the Competitors spend liberally at this Election, far exceeds what the elected Prince has spent, so that the Members of the <HI>Diet</HI> must needs get well by their Election, which I take to be one of the chiefest Rea∣sons why they maintain their Kingdom elective.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why pre∣serve their Kingdom elective.</NOTE> The others are, first, That they take that Government to be easiest, which is executed by a Person whom they have unanimously chosen to obey, being not thereby oblig'd to be subject to a Prince that Nature only has set over their Heads. Secondly, That they esteem an elective Kingdom free from those Hazzards which one that is successive most
<PB N="143" REF="77"/>
commonly incurs during the Minority of its Princes, for that then either its Neigbours take an Occasion to invade it, or its Great Men to embroil it, the better to secure the greater Share in the Government to them∣selves, under so weak a Head. If this be pre∣tended to be remedy'd by assigning fit Tutors and Counsellors to the young Prince; They say, that the Government will be miserably mistaken, for that we do not want in History several Examples of young Kings, who have been driven out of their Thrones by their as∣sign'd Governours: And moreover, that sel∣dom any Kingdom has been known to conti∣nue long in Peace, during the Minority of its King. The third Reason they give is, that in an elective State, rarely any Blood is shed about the Succession, as has frequently hap∣pen'd in other Countries, without fetching any Examples from Antiquity. Fourthly, They say, that a King chosen by the free Consent of the People, will be likely, in common Gratitude, to retaliate the Obliga∣tion by the Clemency and Justice of his Reign. The fifth Advantage which the <HI>Poles</HI> pretend by an Election of their Kings is, that in no other State Princes take so great Care to educate their Children, as in theirs. And the sixth is, That by Means of electing their King, the Gentry (who are only consi∣der'd in <HI>Poland)</HI> have the greater Power of conserving their Liberties and Privileges, in which their greatest Happiness consists. And the seventh is, by limiting the Actions of their Kings to the unanimous Consent of the <HI>Diet.</HI> I might here mention many more
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>
Reasons, but for Fear of tiring your <HI>Lord∣ship</HI> by too long a Digression, I return to my Subject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who have Votes, and who not.</NOTE> As for those that have Suffrages in this Election, it must be observ'd that the <HI>Diet</HI> have in general, as likewise the <HI>Deputies</HI> of some particular Cities, especially the greater ones of <HI>Prussia,</HI> which formerly had not only Place among the <HI>Nuncios,</HI> but also in the <HI>Se∣nate.</HI> As for the lesser, the Bishop of <HI>Varmia</HI> generally subscribes in their Names. There are others who have pretended to, but have been deny'd a Vote in the Election; as the Dukes of <HI>Prussia</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Curland,</HI> when they were only tributary to <HI>Poland.</HI> The King's Sons also are excluded from a Vote, tho' they should be dignify'd with Consent of the Republick. Soldiers likewise are refus'd a Suffrage, tho' it is no wonder that they laid Claim to such a Privilege (be∣ing for the most part chosen out of the Gen∣try) when the <HI>Cosacks</HI> once pretended to it, but who were rejected with Contempt, be∣ing look'd upon to be no better than the Scum or Dregs of the Populace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pacta Conventa.</NOTE> At the Time of this Election, the <HI>Diet</HI> apply themselves to the Conservation of their Rights and Liberties, for this is the best Time to secure their Constitutions and Privi∣leges, and to prevent any Abuse of, or Breach in their Laws▪ for which Purpose they are always then very busie in making new Laws, not only to preserve, but like∣wise enlarge their Prerogatives. As soon
<PB N="145" REF="78"/>
therefore as their King is elected, they pro∣pose to him certain Articles or Capitulations to be agreed to before he can be proclaim'd. These Articles they call <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> being properly a Contract between the King and People, which he swears afterwards to keep inviolable before the Altar in the Church of St. <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Warsaw.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">When taken by Embas∣sadors.</NOTE> Providing the elected King be a foreign Prince, then must his Embassador who repre∣sents him, sign these Articles, and take this Oath for him. Thus at the Election of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> his Embassador <HI>John de Monluc,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Valence,</HI> was oblig'd to come to the <HI>Diet,</HI> where, after the Conditions to be ob∣serv'd by the new King his Master were read to him, he sign'd them in the Name of the said <HI>Henry,</HI> and of <HI>Charles</HI> IX. his Brother, King of <HI>France.</HI> Then was he conducted to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church, where after taking the abovesaid Oath, his Master <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> was proclaim'd King of <HI>Poland</HI> by the Great <HI>Marshal,</HI> the eighteent of <HI>May,</HI> in the Year 1573. Afterwards, according to Custom in these Cases, Embassadors were sent by the Republick to take the Oath from that King in Person at <HI>Paris,</HI> which they did on the tenth of <HI>September</HI> following. This is the Method prescrib'd by the Laws for swearing, to observe the <HI>Pacta Conventa;</HI> yet which is not always punctually observ'd, for King <HI>Mi∣chael</HI> and <HI>John Sobieski</HI> took that Oath several Days after their Election.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">By whom drawn and after what manner Admini∣stred.</NOTE> The Form of this Agreement or Capitula∣tion is drawn up and methodiz'd by Order of the <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Deputies,</HI> at the same time that they make the Decree of Election; after which the three Orders, <HI>viz.</HI> the King elect or his Embassador, the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>Deputies</HI> go to the Church, where the Chancellor or Grand <HI>Marshal</HI> reads distinctly with an audi∣ble Voice, the whole Contract as follows.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Occasional Articles▪</NOTE> To these Articles they commonly add seve∣ral others, which vary according to the Cir∣cumstances of Time or Quality of the Person elected King.

The Reason that made them think of this was, because the late King almost always had an ambulatory Court, having no certain or fix'd Residence or Abode: For sometimes he liv'd on his own Estate in <HI>Prussia,</HI> and sometimes in <HI>Russia</HI> at <HI>Zolkiew,</HI> and so rambled about from one Country Palace to another, where oftentimes the Courtiers, Ambassadors, or several Gentle∣men of the Kingdom, that were forc'd to fol∣low him about Business, found but very in∣different Lodgings and Entertainment. It may here be observ'd, that at new Elections they always make some new Constitution or other, for the Benefit of the Nation, and to abridge the Power of their Kings.</P>

It is observable, that from the Time of the King's Election, to that of his Coronation, the great or petty <HI>Marshal</HI> does not carry the Staff erected before him; that when he issues out any Orders or Proclamations, he assumes only the Character of King-elect, and that no∣thing can then be seal'd but by the Signet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the Election of a Succes∣sor.</NOTE> Before I proceed to describe the Coronati∣on of a King of <HI>Poland,</HI> I may here reasona∣bly insert something concerning the Election of a <HI>Successor,</HI> which tho' it be contrary to the Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom, and repugnant to the Privileges of an elective Mo∣narchy, yet a Father will have always that Respect for his Child, that he will endeavour to get him to succeed him, even while he lives: So <HI>Sigismund</HI> II. was nam'd King in the Life-time of his Father <HI>Sigismund</HI> I. but still on Condition that he should not meddle with the Government so long as his Father liv'd.

Secondly, That he should be a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick. Thirdly, That he should not be a <HI>Piasto</HI> or Native.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for and against such an▪ E∣lection.</NOTE> No doubt, the Designs of King <HI>Casimir,</HI> and of all those that were for the Election of a <HI>Successor</HI> were good, for they had thereby a Mind to secure the Government from those Divisions and Intestine Jarrs which common∣ly happen in <HI>Interregnums.</HI> But those who oppos'd them affirm'd, that the Election of a <HI>Successor</HI> would undoubtedly soon introduce an Hereditary Monarchy, and be the ruin of their Liberties and Privileges, whatever care they could take to prevent it: That it would

be likewise against the Constitutions of the Realm to Elect a <HI>Soccessor</HI> in the King's Life time; and that if the Republic consented to it, they would be no longer at Liberty to op∣pose it: That it would moreover, be an In∣jury done to several Princes, who all had a kind of Right to the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> which would therefore infallibly embroil it in new Troubles, when it was the Interest of that Crown to be at Peace with all the World.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And what requir'd to confirm it.</NOTE> As for the Manner of a Queen's Coronation alone, it must be with the King's Consent; he must request it of the Republick; he must be present at the Ceremony; he must lead his Queen into the Church, and he must pre∣sent her to the Archbishop or other Bishop, who is to Crown her, Anoint her with conse∣crated Oyl, and to put a Scepter into her Right Hand, and Globe into her Left.

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the most Honourable JOHN, Lord Marquess of <HI>Norman∣by.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Power of the Gentry, and Slavery of the Commonalty in <HI>Poland;</HI> with an Ac∣count of the Customs and Manners of the People of that Kingdom; as likewise of some peculiarly relating to particular Countries.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO approach so great a Person as your Lordship on so trifling an Ac∣count as the Subject of this Letter, I was conscious to my self, was no way suit∣able. On one Hand your known Abilities might reasonably deter my Presumption, and on the other, your elate Quality check my Ambition: Yet, considering at the same time, that sometimes the greatest Genius's and Persons have stoop'd to be entertain'd with the Follies and Transactions of the Crowd, I hop'd, among the rest, I might not offend if I address'd this Letter to you; and the rather because it was first design'd
<PB N="167" REF="89"/>
for the Entertainment of your Lordships Lei∣sure Hours.</P>
<P><HI>My LORD,</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentry only capable of Prefer¦ment.</NOTE> The Third Order of the Republick of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> is that of the Nobility; out of which all the <HI>Senators,</HI> and all other Officers, as well Civil as Military, are taken; for no Bo∣dy else that is not a <HI>Polish</HI> Gentleman, tho' he be never so Noble in his own Country, can be capable of any Preferment here, un∣less it be some inconsiderable Posts in the Ar∣my, the highest whereof is a Colonel, or at most a Major-General, which is much the same with a Brigadeer in our Army. So that there is little or no Encouragement for Per∣sons of foreign Countries, of what Merit or Degree soever, to go to serve this Repub∣lick, which proves no small Inconvenience and Prejudice to their State.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commonal∣ty Incapa∣ble except some few.</NOTE> As for the Citizens and Peasants, they are excluded from all Preferments, and can have no Possessions unless they be a few Houses in a City, or a small Piece of Land about a League off in the Country. But here the Ci∣tizens in <HI>Prussia</HI> are excepted, for they may possess Lands of what Extent soever, out of their Cities. Also the Inhabitants of <HI>Cracow</HI> may purchase and enjoy Lands in any Part of the Kingdom. Likewise the Magistrates of <HI>Vilna</HI> have a Power to possess Lands, and the City of <HI>Leopol</HI> in like manner has a Privilege for its private Citizens to hold Lands.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="90"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentrys Power and Privileges.</NOTE> A Nobleman, Gentleman, or one that is free-born of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> are the same thing. Every Gentleman has his Coat of Arms granted him by the Republick but then; either he or some of his Family must have Possessions in Lands there. He can pretend to all the greatest Employments and Offices in the Kingdom, and buy Lands where he pleases all over the Dominions of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania:</HI> He has moreover a Right to the Crown, if his Credit and Interest can pro∣cure it. Every Gentleman is a Sovereign Lord and Master in his own Lands, for he has the Power of Life and Death over his Te∣nants, or (as the <HI>Poles</HI> term them) his Sub∣jects, tho' I may better call them his Slaves, for they have neither Privilege nor Law to protect them, but are to be govern'd abso∣lutely by the Will and Pleasure of their Lord. They dare not leave his Lands to go to ano∣thers, under Pain of Death, unless he sells them to his Neighbour, as he has the Power to do, or has violated or ravish'd their Wives or Daughters; insomuch that I have heard that some have wish'd to have had a fine Wife or Daughter, that their Lord might thereby have given them Occasion to get rid of him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cannot be Apprehend∣ed till con∣victed.</NOTE> If a Gentleman kills another Gentleman's Slave, he is neither to be try'd nor punish'd for it, and is only oblig'd to give that Gen∣tleman another Slave in the Room of him, or as much Money as will buy one: And be∣sides, to maintain the Family of the Person
<PB N="169" REF="90"/>
that he has kill'd: likewise if he kills one of his own Slaves, he only pays a matter of fif∣ty Livres to be quit. Nay, if one Gentle∣man kills another, he cannot be apprehended nor clapt into Prison for his Crime <HI>Nisi Jure Victus,</HI> unless a Court of Justice has first con∣victed him, which commonly gives him Time enough to escape, for he must first be cited to appear, and upon his Neglect he is declar'd contumacious, and consequently convicted: But it may very well be suppos'd, that he who knows himself guilty, will not run the Hazard of Appearing, nor venture the losing of his Head. This Honour the <HI>Poles</HI> likewise bestow on the common People, Hanging being not the usual Way of Executi∣on in their Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exception.</NOTE> <HI>However,</HI> Hartknoch <HI>has these Exceptions from this Privilege;</HI> for <HI>(says he)</HI> if a No∣bleman be taken in the very Act of Ra∣vishing, Burning of Houses, Theft, Robbery, or the like, he may be apprehended by the Laws: Likewise if he will not give sufficient Caution, ac∣cording to the Quality of his Offence; or lastly, if he be found in the Register to have been thrice con∣victed before.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Privilege of the Nobility <HI>(says</HI> Hauteville) I have known one Instance to the contrary, for those who assassinated <HI>Gonczen∣ski,</HI> Petty General of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> were seiz'd without any Formality, and carry'd Prisoners to <HI>Elbing,</HI> and were afterwards condemn'd to be be∣headed at the general <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> in the Year <HI>1664.</HI> but then this Crime of theirs was so notorious, that the Nobility might well have
<PB N="170" REF="91"/>
wav'd their Privilege; for these Villains took that Gentleman out of his Bed at <HI>Vilna,</HI> and putting him into a Coach with a Confessor, carry'd him out of the City, where they scarce allow'd him Time to say his Prayers before they shot him dead with Pistols.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cannot be Executed without the Kings Consent.</NOTE> A <HI>Polish</HI> Nobleman, tho' he be proscrib'd and cited, and found guilty, cannot be exe∣cuted without the King's Knowledge and Consent, as may appear by the Case of <HI>Samu∣el Zborowski,</HI> who tho' he had been proscrib'd and condemn'd by the Great Chancellor and General of the Army <HI>Zamoiski,</HI> yet would he not presume to Behead him till he had known King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Pleasure therein.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Need not Quarter Soldiers.</NOTE> The <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry also have another Privi∣lege which is, that no Soldiers or Officers of the Army can be Quarter'd upon them, for if any one should presume to attempt such a thing, the <HI>Diet</HI> would either condemn him to Death, or pronounce him infamous, where∣by he would be depriv'd of the Power of giv∣ing his Vote in all Assemblies, and moreover be render'd incapable of enjoying any Office or Employment in the <HI>State,</HI> and this is as being degraded from his Nobility; whereup∣on I may take notice of a Passage that hap∣ned at the <HI>Diet</HI> of Election of <HI>John</HI> III. and which did not a little contribute towards his being chosen. The Palatin of <HI>Smolensko</HI>'s Son went and quarter'd at the House of <HI>Wiesno∣wiski,</HI> without his Leave (as was reported) by Order of the Grand General <HI>Patz,</HI> which occasion'd the <HI>Marshals,</HI> who are Judges in
<PB N="171" REF="91"/>
these Cases, two Days before the breaking up of the <HI>Diet,</HI> to deprive this <HI>Palatin</HI> of his Vote in the Election, whereby <HI>Sobieski</HI> was freed from a declar'd Enemy, and the <HI>Au∣strian</HI> Faction lost a profess'd Friend.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Pri∣vileges of the Gentry.</NOTE> The King likewise cannot now lodg in any Nobleman's House against his Will, as he could before the Year 1433. Also wherever any Foreigner dies without Heirs, his Estate <HI>Escheats</HI> to the Lord of those Lands where he dy'd, and not to the King. And where any <HI>Polish</HI> Gentleman dies without Heirs, the King cannot seize upon his Estate by Right of <HI>Escheat,</HI> if he have a Relation left of the eighth Degree inclusively. The Gentry also may have Houses in the King's Cities and Towns, but then they must not let such Trades inhabit them, as may prove obnoxi∣ous, or a Nusance to the Citizens; and like∣wise these Houses ought to be subject to the Jurisdiction of the City, but which however is seldom or never observ'd. The House of a Nobleman moreover is a Kind of <HI>Asylum,</HI> for tho' Delinquents may be arrested there with his Consent, yet cannot they be taken thence by Force.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Need not pay Taxes unless obli∣g'd by the <HI>Diet.</HI></NOTE> Not less are a Nobleman's Privileges as to Customs and Taxes, for if he will swear his Goods were not bought, but arising from his Lands, he may send them any where out of the Kingdom to be sold without paying Duties; and where he has once so sworn, his Testimonials alone for the future will suffice to exempt them. Also his Subjects will have
<PB N="172" REF="92"/>
the same Privilege wherever they trade. In <HI>Prussia</HI> the Nobles are not only free from Cu∣stoms, but likewise all the other Inhabitants by the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>Culm.</HI> But altho the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility are thus said to be free from Taxes, yet upon emergent Occasions and Ex∣igencies, the <HI>Diet</HI> usually obliges them to pay them for a certain Time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Privilege of Preemp∣tion.</NOTE> The Nobility also have a Privilege of Pre∣emption of Salt; for in the Staples for that Commodity, there must be at least a Months Notice before any can be sold to any body else.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Have one Grievance notwith∣standing.</NOTE> After all these Privileges, the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobi∣lity have one very great Grievance, which is that they are oblig'd to serve in the <HI>Pospolite Ruszanie,</HI> or General Muster of the <HI>Militia,</HI> at their own Charges.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they came by these Pri∣vileges.</NOTE> How the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry came by all these Privileges, it may not be here improper to en∣quire, since it is certain that formerly they were not much better than Slaves: For to pass by many other Examples, <HI>Cromerus</HI> says, they were once oblig'd to keep the King's Dogs. The first Glimpse of their Li∣berty may reasonably be ascrib'd to the Pri∣vileges granted the Clergy by <HI>Boleslaus</HI> the <HI>Chast;</HI> but afterwards when <HI>Poland</HI> began to be harrass'd by Civil Wars, the Gentry ob∣tain'd many larger Privileges from their Kings, and which they have since always ta∣ken Care to get augmented at every new Ele∣ction.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="92"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">All equal and conse∣sequently value no Honour.</NOTE> All the Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> are equal by Birth, notwithstanding some of the meaner Sort send their Children to serve the Great Men as other Servants, and this principally to learn Breeding and to be kept in Awe; yet may that very same Servant have as good a Vote in the <HI>Diet</HI> as his Master. They nei∣ther value nor care for Titles of Honour, for they think the greatest they can have, is to be a Noble <HI>Pole,</HI> or Gentleman of <HI>Poland.</HI> Neither the King nor Republick gives any Title of Prince, Duke, Marquess, Count, Vicount, Baron, or Knight, to any of the free-born of the Nation, thinking (I sup∣pose) that none can be any ways rais'd above another by a bare exteriour Denomination, which argues more the Favour of the Prince, than Merit of the Person preferr'd, but ra∣ther by their Services in the Offices and Em∣ployments which they enjoy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Title of Prince de∣spis'd.</NOTE> There are no Princes of the Kingdom, but those which are of the Royal Family, for al∣tho some of the <HI>Poles</HI> have been made Princes of the Empire by the Emperour, as Prince <HI>Lubomirski,</HI> &amp;c. Yet it gives them no Prece∣dence in <HI>Poland,</HI> but rather renders them odi∣ous and despis'd by the rest of the Gentry, who cannot endure that any should pretend to any Superiority among them, especially by a Title which is not annex'd to some Employ∣ment in the Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Order</HI> Instituted but under∣valu'd.</NOTE> King <HI>Sigismund</HI> III. thought of establishing an <HI>Order</HI> of Knighthood of the <HI>Immaculate</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="93"/>
<HI>Conception</HI> in <HI>Poland;</HI> and had effectually crea∣ted several Knights thereof, allowing them certain Privileges, and a Superiority above others; but these were so despis'd and under∣valu'd by the rest of the Gentry, that scarce any one afterwards car'd for that up-start Ho∣nour; whereupon that <HI>Order</HI> soon dwindled into nothing. The <HI>Poles</HI> have a Proverb to prove their Equality which is, <HI>That they are measur'd like a Bushel of Corn,</HI> that is, whenever any one pretends to rise but a Grain above the Level, he is immediately struck off and ridi∣cul'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Dut∣chies in <HI>Po∣land.</HI></NOTE> There are some Gentlemen in <HI>Poland,</HI> that have had Dutchies time out of mind annex'd to their Estates, as Duke <HI>Radzivil</HI> in <HI>Lithua∣nia,</HI> &amp;c. But there are no Dutchies or Counties created by the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polish</HI> Gen∣try assume Titles when they Travel.</NOTE> Tho the <HI>Poles</HI> in their own Country have no Honorary Titles above a Gentleman, yet several have been known to have usurp'd them when they have travell'd into <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> for they there frequent∣ly assume those of <HI>Counts</HI> to themselves, in like manner as the <HI>Germans</HI> in foreign Coun∣tries do those of <HI>Barons,</HI> for nothing is more common than <HI>Monsieur le Conte Malakowski, Il Signior Conde Potoski, Mynheer Graff Jablo∣nowski,</HI> &amp;c. And this they do to be the more easily admitted into Company, especially in <HI>Germany,</HI> where 'tis scarce thought that any body can be a Gentleman under a <HI>Baron,</HI> and consequently not fit for Conversation. Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> likewise says, he has known some of
<PB N="175" REF="93"/>
our <HI>English</HI> Gentry in these Countries that have not scrupul'd to call themselves <HI>Lords</HI> to procure them the greater Respect, since they saw that the Title of Gentleman alone was not regarded there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther Power of <HI>Polish</HI> Gen∣try.</NOTE> The Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> make and defend their own Laws and Liberties, elect their King with all manner of Freedom, give him the Crown and Scepter, appoint Ministers to counsel and instruct him, and their Number far exceeding that of the <HI>Senate,</HI> they easily keep the King and <HI>Senators</HI> in their Duty, and threaten both very often, especially in the <HI>Diet,</HI> where each Member has a Liberty to speak what he thinks, and to think what he pleases. 'Tis they that despute the <HI>Nun∣cios,</HI> out of themselves, for every Province, to meet and sit in the General <HI>Diet,</HI> with full In∣structions, and absolute Power not to consent to any Proceedings which should in the least entrench on their Privileges, or if such <HI>Depu∣ties</HI> should happen to be brib'd to act con∣trary to their Instructions, then have the Gentry of the Province whence they were sent, a free Authority to punish them for so doing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What makes them so Great.</NOTE> Not only these excessive Privileges make the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry Powerful and Great, but likewise the vast Territories which a great Number of them enjoy with a Despotick Power over their Subjects, for some possess Five, some Ten, some Fifteen, some Twenty, nay some Thirty Leagues of Land out right, whereon they have always their several <HI>Pod-Starostas</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="94"/>
or Gentlemen-Stewards residing, who are to take Account of their Revenues, to sell some things, and to send the rest to their Masters Houses, to defray the Exigencies of the Family. Some also are Hereditary Sove∣reigns of Cities which the King has nothing to do with, and one of the Princes, <HI>Lubomirski,</HI> possesses above Four Thousand Cities, Towns, and Villages. Moreover, some can raise an Army of Five, Six, Eight, and Ten Thousand Men, and maintain them at their own Charges when they have done. Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, Prince <HI>Lubomirski</HI> had actually Seven Thousand Horse, Foot, and Dragoons in Pay when he was in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ex∣cessive Grandeur and Mag∣nificence.</NOTE> All the Gentry of Note live most splendid∣ly: They have all their Horse and Foot Guards, which keep Centry Night and Day at the Gates of their Houses (they call them Courts) and in their Anti-Chambers. These Guards go before and after their Masters Coaches in the Streets: But above all, these Noblemen make an extraordinary Figure at the General <HI>Diets,</HI> where some have Three Hundred, some Five, and some a Thousand Guards always attending them. Nay, <HI>Hau∣teville</HI> says, that formerly some Great Per∣sons have been known to come to the <HI>Diet</HI> with above Ten Thousand Men. They esteem themselves not only equal, but also above the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> especially such among them as are Senators. 'Tis cer∣tain, they want nothing to be as so many So∣vereign Princes, except the Liberty of coin∣ing Money, which the Republick has reserv'd
<PB N="177" REF="94"/>
wholly to it self. The <HI>Doctor</HI> says, he has no where seen Subjects live with such exces∣sive Grandeur and Splendour; for these Great Men, when they go to Dinner or Sup∣per, have always their Trumpets sounding, and a great Number of Gentry to wait on them at Table, some whereof carve, some give to drink, others reach Plates, and all serve with extraordinary Respect and Sub∣mission; for tho all the Gentry in <HI>Poland</HI> are equal, and have all their free Votes in the <HI>Diet,</HI> yet the Little and Poorer Sort think it no Disgrace to serve them that can maintain them. 'Tis true, the Gentleman they serve is commonly very civil to them, for the eld∣est of them generally eats with him at Table with his Cap off, and every one of them has a Peasant-Boy to wait on him, which the Master maintains; yet if any one of these Gen∣tlemen-Servants neglects his Duty, his Ma∣ster punishes him severely, tho' he has no Power to take away his Life because he is a Gentleman, but he may get him whipt naked with a certain Formality which I have menti∣on'd before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Means to support for ever the <HI>Polish</HI> Re∣public.</NOTE> It may not be here amiss to observe to your <HI>Lordship</HI> some few Maxims whereby the Republick of <HI>Poland</HI> might always subsist, and the Gentry retain their ancient Privile∣ges. First, By reducing all the Gentry of the Kingdom to an equal Authority in the Ele∣ction of a King, and other publick Delibera∣tions, by which the King or <HI>Senate</HI> would be depriv'd of a Power of raising any considera∣ble Factions; and the <HI>Grandees</HI> be discourag'd
<PB N="178" REF="95"/>
from affecting and hunting after Foreign Ti∣tles which commonly ensnare them to the Prejudice of their Country. Secondly, By keeping up the free Choice of their <HI>Nuncios,</HI> which would disable the Court and <HI>Senate</HI> from getting their Creatures elected, to the utter abrogating of the Privileges of the Gen∣try, wherein the <HI>Poles</HI> now follows the pru∣dent Example of the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth. Thirdly, By preserving the Custom of the Gentries appearing in great Numbers at the <HI>Diet,</HI> which animates both the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>De∣puties</HI> in the Prosecution of Affairs for the Good of the Kingdom, and deters them from being biass'd by any sinister Means. Fourthly, By obliging both <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>De∣puties</HI> to give an Account of their Proceedings, which must needs encline them to act with a great deal of Precaution. Fifthly, By pro∣hibiting the Army to come near the great Assembly of the States, for <HI>Rome</HI> never en∣joy'd so great Happiness as when the Gown had Preference of the Sword. Sixthly, To maintain the Law of Equality in Matters of Descent, whereby the Gentry would be kept at an even Lay, and hinder'd from disturbing the Government by too great a Power. Se∣venthly, Never to prefer any Native to the Crown, because of the great Disorders it might in all Likelyhood occasion. Eighthly, To maintaim the Authority of their <HI>Democra∣cy</HI> establish'd for so many Ages, by the Pru∣dence of their Ancestors, and all along con∣tinu'd with no small Hazards and Trouble. And Ninthly, Never to permit any Foreign Princes to intermeddle with their Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="95"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What fo∣reign Em∣bassadors are oblig'd to.</NOTE> There is no Country where Embassadors are oblig'd to make so great a Figure as in <HI>Po∣land,</HI> especially if they have any Interest of the Prince their Master to maintain or carry on in the <HI>Diet</HI> or among the Gentry; for the Great Men there generally despise all such as either do not or cannot make the same Fi∣gure with themselves, which is so excessive, that an Embassador must have three remarka∣ble Qualities to keep up with it. For first, he must have a great Train of Coaches and Servants proportionable; next keep a plenti∣ful and open House continually, to Treat and Fuddle the Gentry, and where he must be ve∣ry humble and familiar with them, they be∣ing generally very civil and easie in their Conversation: And lastly, which is the surest way to gain their Affection and Suffrages, he must give 'em ever now and then a little Mo∣ney, and he still promising them more, for Reasons I have mention'd before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Law Diffe∣rences deci∣ded by the Sword.</NOTE> When the Great Men of <HI>Poland</HI> have any Suit at Law, or other Difference to be de∣termin'd, the Justice of the Kingdom is com∣monly too weak for them; for tho' the <HI>Diet</HI> or other Tribunals had decided the Matter in Favour of one of the two Parties, yet the Ex∣ecution of their Judgment must be left to the Power of the strongest Sword; for these <HI>Grandees</HI> generally think it beneath them to submit to the Sentence of a Company of Judges without a Field-Battle. Sometimes they will raise five or six Thousand of a Side, plun∣der and burn one anothers Towns and Cities,
<PB N="180" REF="96"/>
and besiege each others Castles and Forts, and after a great deal of Blood-shed, Fatigue, and Expence, the unjuster Cause shall commonly get the upper Hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Exam∣ple.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, When he was in <HI>Poland,</HI> there was a Quarrel between Duke <HI>Raazivil</HI> and Prince <HI>Sapieha,</HI> about whether of the two should be Guardian to the young Princess of <HI>Newbourg,</HI> Neece to the present Empress, for her Mother was Dutchess <HI>Radzivil</HI> of <HI>Lithua∣nia,</HI> and Heiress of the greatest Estate in the Kingdom. Both Parties had their Troops in the Field, and had some Skirmishes, but it was thought that Prince <HI>Sapieha,</HI> being Great General of the Forces of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> would get the better, tho' it seems Duke <HI>Radzivil,</HI> as being her Mother's Relation, had more Right to the Guardianship of her. All this while the King never concern'd himself in the Quarrel, nor declar'd for either Par∣ty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of Descents in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> As to Matters of Descent, The Father's Estate is always equally divided among his Children, in like manner as in <HI>Italy, Germa∣ny,</HI> and most Foreign Countries, but when the Father is dead, the Mother can enjoy all his Estate for Life, and it is absolutely in her Breast to allot every one of the Children their <HI>Quota,</HI> or to keep all the Estate to her own Use during her Life. Some Mothers Marry after the Husbands Deaths, and so spend their first Childrens Fortunes with their second Husbands. This makes the Children more than ordinary obedient to
<PB N="181" REF="96"/>
their Mothers, especially during their Wid∣dowhood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Children however support their Fa∣milies.</NOTE> Altho Estates in <HI>Poland</HI> are equally divi∣ded among the Children, which one would think should absolutely weaken or ruin their Families, yet do they generally find Means to support and keep them up; for most com∣monly some of the Brothers turn Monks, and so get to be made Abbots or Bishops, whose Revenues are here sufficient to enrich any Fa∣mily; and the rest look after State-Employ∣ments, which are likewise considerable. Some of the Daughters also many times be∣come Nuns, so that being in the Church Ser∣vice, they are oblig'd to live in Celibacy, and consequently leaving no Heirs, all their Goods or Estates fall to their Marry'd Bro∣thers or Sisters, or to their Children. In this Country the Daughters always walk be∣fore their Mothers, as in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the un∣marry'd Sisters before the marry'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Tem∣per of the <HI>Poles</HI> and its Effect.</NOTE> I cannot but admire at the honest and good Temper of the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry; for tho' their Liberty is extraordinary; tho' they have Power of Life and Death over their Subjects; tho' they are in a manner above their own Laws, and tho' Justice is administer'd in <HI>Po∣land</HI> more slightly than in any other Country, yet Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, that all the while that he was in that Kingdom, he neither saw nor heard of any Murther or Slaughter, or of any Barbarity or Cruelty committed by the Gen∣try on their Subjects; nor, what is a great∣er Wonder, of any High-way Robbers, but
<PB N="182" REF="97"/>
always observ'd the <HI>Poles</HI> in general to be good humour'd, harmless, and generous: When it is certain, had we in <HI>England</HI> but the third Part of their Liberty, we could not live together without cutting one anothers Throats, since Experience dayly shews, that notwithstanding the great Vigilancy of our Officers, the Severity of our Laws, the just Rigour of our Judges and Magistrates, and the punctual Execution of their Sentences and Judgments, the Gallows and Gibbets are more frequently visited here, than even the Prisons are in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Occa∣sion'd.</NOTE> I fancy the Reason that the <HI>Poles</HI> are so quiet and good natur'd is, because being born free, and living in an excessive Liberty, under no Laws nor Arbitrary Power, there is nothing before them that can constrain their Minds, bridle their Passions, or curb their Thoughts; but as there is nothing that can entice them to do ill, so nothing likewise can hinder them from doing it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polish Pea∣sants how first Ensla∣v'd.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, He has ask'd some <HI>Polish</HI> Noblemen, why they so inhumanely treated and undervalu'd their Boors: They answer'd, That formerly all the Boors of the Kingdom revolted from their Landlords, rebell'd against them, (as the <HI>Swissers</HI> did against their Gen∣try) and conspir'd together to extirpate and destroy them all; that they Murther'd and kill'd a vast number of Gentlemen; and that the rest were oblig'd either to hide them∣selves, or to leave the Kingdom. But that at length the Gentry getting together from

all Parts; and being moreover Assisted by their Neighbours, they so frighted and de∣feated the poor Peasants, who had made a ge∣neral Insurrection against them, to set up a Commonwealth of their own, that they brought them to such Extremities, that ever since they have been contented to be kept Slaves. Yet the <HI>Poles</HI> say, that though they have an Absolute Power over them, they sel∣dom make use of it any more than other Christians do over their Dogs or Horses. Strange Comparison! As if they spar'd the poor Peoples Lives rather out of Self-interest, than Charity; and by reason that they thought they would be more serviceable to them Living than Dead; not unlike some Kings, who give Malefactors their Lives, only to prefer them to their Gallys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Live satis∣fy'd not∣withstand∣ing.</NOTE> Notwithstanding the Peasants in <HI>Poland</HI> be∣ing born Slaves, and having no manner of Notion of Liberty, live very well satisfy'd and contented. In <HI>Curland</HI> they are as sub∣ject to their Landlords as in <HI>Poland;</HI> and in both Countries, Masters are almost paid Ado∣ration. Their Slaves love them, and Fight willingly for them; and all they have is abso∣lutely at their Devotion. Nay, though they Debauch their Wives and Daughters, yet they only care to obtain their Liberty by it; and this is so common a thing among these poor Wretches, that they never value their Wo∣men the less for it, nor think themselves a whit either injur'd or dishonour'd by it.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="98"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pre∣sent Condi∣tion.</NOTE> The Condition of the <HI>Kmetons</HI> (as the <HI>Poles</HI> call them) or Boors, or Rusticks, at this Day in <HI>Poland</HI> is such, that they lead mi∣serable and wretched Lives, haviug no Laws, no Judges, and scarce any Religion among them; but like Brutes, they are forc'd to Work on Sundays, and dare not so much as Appeal to the King or <HI>Diet</HI> for Redress. How∣ever, in Royal <HI>Prussia</HI> their Condition is something better; for there they enjoy al∣most the same Laws and Liberties with the Gentry. Formerly <HI>Casimir</HI> the Great made several Laws in their behalf; but which at this day are seldom or never practis'd. All Bishops, Abbots, <HI>Palatins, Castellans,</HI> &amp;c. are oblig'd to be of the <HI>Nobless,</HI> except a certain Number assign'd by King <HI>John Albert</HI> out of the <HI>Plebeians,</HI> to be capable of being inferiour Divines, Lawyers or Physicians only. An Exception from this Law may be seen in the Person of <HI>Peter Gamratus,</HI> who from a <HI>Ple∣beian</HI> was prefer'd by <HI>Sigismund,</HI> to several both Ecclesiastical and Temporal Dignities: But in <HI>Prussia,</HI> as I have remark'd before, the Customs are much more indulgent to the Common People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enrich their Lords.</NOTE> As I have hinted before to your Lordship, a Gentleman's Revenue in <HI>Poland</HI> partly con∣sists in his Slaves; for he cannot well be esteem'd Rich, unless he has a great Number of these poor Creatures under his Power; whereof there is scarce any but earn their Lords a 100 <HI>Franks</HI> a year. It may not be improper therefore, to observe here the Man∣ners
<PB N="185" REF="98"/>
and Customs of these poor Wretches; And it may first be remark'd, That these Slaves can enjoy nothing of their own, nor ever become Free, unless they can get into some Convent, or get to be Ordain'd Priests, or else incline their Masters to Debauch their Wives or Daughters, whereby the Law sets them Free: But most commonly their Lords have a watchful Eye over them, and obviate all their Policies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How esta∣blish'd in a Farm.</NOTE> These Lords never Let their Lands to Farm; but to establish a Peasant on them, they forth∣with order the other Peasants of the Village at their own Charges, to Build him a House, Furnish him with a Cow, Hens, Geese, and a quantity of Rye sufficient to keep him a Year: so that a Lord of a Village is at no other Charge to set up a Slave on his Lands, than he first Cost him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ser∣vice an∣nex'd thereto.</NOTE> These poor Slaves, or Subjects as they call them, most commonly work three Days in a Week for their Lords, to one for themselves, and sometimes four. Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, in his time a Country-man had a mind to forward his Son in Learning, and would have sent him to the University; but which the <HI>Signior</HI> would by no means condescend to, and put the Son in Prison for refusing to be his Secretary, till at last the Father was forc'd to purchase his Liberty at the Expence of 400 Crowns which he had Borrow'd. When a Lord sells his Land, the Slaves commonly go along with it, though he can dispose of either separately, if he pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="99"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meet to reap their Lords Corn.</NOTE> At the time of Harvest all the Peasants of the Village meet together to Reap their Lords Corn, who are supervis'd, and forc'd to Work by very rigid Taskmasters. Their Punishments are sometimes several Blows of a Cudgel, and sometimes a kind of Pillory, wherein those Wretches shall be sometimes set for a whole Day together. I should think now, these poor Wretches the most misera∣ble Creatures Breathing; but they on the contrary, never having known any better Condition; and having seen their Fathers Slaves before them, are well satisfied and con∣tented with their Servitude. But however, they have this Happiness, that they seldom want for Victuals and Drink; for their Wives chiefest Employment is to provide them with that.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Man∣ners at Bed and Board.</NOTE> They have generally three or four sorts at a Meal, <HI>viz.</HI> One of Pease, with a little Ba∣con slic'd among it. Another of Course Wheat, Barley, or Millet, whereof they make their <HI>Cachat;</HI> and two others of seve∣ral sorts of strengthening Roots; whereof they have great Plenty, and very good. The Movables of these Peasants Cottages are only a few Earthen or Wooden Dishes, and a hard Bed, which they make themselves, with a very wretched Coverlet. Their Children are not suffer'd to have a Bed till they are Mar∣ry'd; but are forc'd to lye upon Boards by the Hearth side. These sort of Hearths have no Chimneys; and the Smoak has only a little Hole to get out at the Top of the House.
<PB N="187" REF="99"/>
In <HI>Poland</HI> it is impossible to subsist a Nights without these Hearths; and therefore not only the Peasants, but Gentry likewise, are oblig'd to have them; though the last are of different Make and Materials from the for∣mer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Children how taught to go.</NOTE> The Peasants Children, especially in <HI>Russia,</HI> go Naked till they are four or five years Old. They are not taught to go till they are indif∣ferent Strong, and then their Mother sets them against the Threshold of the Door, where they first begin to Essay their Strength. After they have roll'd about till they are suf∣ficiently Dirty, she takes them and washes them in Cold Water, as I observ'd before; so that this being first considered, it need not be wonder'd that they afterwards become so exceeding hardy. <HI>I have seen some of these Children</HI> (says <HI>Hauterille) that would slide along upon the Ice for a good way together stark Naked.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habits of both the Men and Women.</NOTE> For the Habits which these Peasants use in Winter, they are a Sheep Skin with the Wool on; and in Summer, a Close-body'd Coat of Course Stuff, of a Colour much like our Chimney-Sweepers. They also wear ordina∣ry Caps on their Heads. Sometimes they have Boots for their Legs, but most com∣monly the Rind of Trees only wrapp'd round them, with the thicker part to guard the Soles of their Feet against Stones: The same Custom is us'd in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> as may be seen hereafter. The Women-Peasants are habited in like manner as in other Countries, except
<PB N="188" REF="100"/>
that their Smocks and Petticoats are exceed∣ing Short. Those in <HI>Russia</HI> go generally in Summer in their Smocks, with an Apron be∣fore them that reaches lower than ordinary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nobility how acqui∣r'd in <HI>Po∣land.</HI></NOTE> Now I shall proceed to inform your Lord∣ship how Nobility is acquir'd in <HI>Poland,</HI> which is first by Birth, where both the Pa∣rents were Noble: Nevertheless now a-days, by a long Tract of Custom, not only such are reputed Noble, but likewise those whose Mothers were Plebeians▪ for nothing is at pre∣sent more practis'd in <HI>Poland</HI> than for the Gentry to match with the Commonalty, es∣pecially with those that are rich. Secondly, Nobility is acquir'd by Creation, which for∣merly was wholly at the King's. Pleasure, but of latter Days is only at the Disposal of the <HI>Senate</HI> or <HI>Diet.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Creation of a Gentle∣man.</NOTE> The Manner of making a Gentleman is this. The King not being sole sufficient for that Purpose, he is oblig'd to send to all the little <HI>Diets</HI> of the Kingdom for their Consent, which afterwards also must be approv'd by the Great <HI>Diet,</HI> and then a Gentleman may have his <HI>Diploma,</HI> and be enroll'd. All this Ceremony, and a great deal more goes to the making of a Gentleman in <HI>Poland.</HI> A <HI>Jew</HI> is made a Gentleman, first by becoming a Christian, and then by signalizing himself in the Wars, when he is propos'd by the King to the little <HI>Diets,</HI> and afterwards con∣firm'd by the great one. It may be here ob∣serv'd that 'tis better to be born than crea∣ted Noble, for these last (call'd by the <HI>Poles</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="100"/>
<HI>Scartabelli)</HI> are subject to several Impositions and Inconveniencies which the others are ex∣empt from.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A third way of be∣coming No∣ble.</NOTE> There is a third way of becoming Noble, which is by serving as Magistrate in some pri∣vileg'd City, particularly in <HI>Cracow</HI> and <HI>Vil∣na,</HI> where the <HI>Consuls</HI> or <HI>Senators</HI> are quali∣fy'd to transmit their Privileges to their Po∣sterity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three ways of forfeit∣ing it.</NOTE> Also as Nobility is to be gain'd, so likewise it may be forfeited three Ways: First, by some heinous Crime: For Example, where a Nobleman permits one that is Ignoble to usurp his Coat of Arms. Secondly, by exer∣cising any Trade or Merchandizing, or any sordid Calling in any City or Town; where∣by he immediately forfeits his Privileges and Quality. And thirdly, by being a Ma∣gistrate in any City not Privileg'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In what Case resto∣r'd.</NOTE> However, tho' Nobility may by these Means be lost and forfeited, yet many have been known to be restor'd where their Pa∣rents had quitted their Quality thro' Poverty, the <HI>Poles</HI> justly considering the Force of that Condition, which is able to drive Men to the most Ignoble Actions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chracter of the <HI>Poles.</HI></NOTE> To give your Lordship a Character of the <HI>Poles,</HI> I may affirm that they exceed all the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> in Vivacity of Spirit, Strength of Body, and living long, which cannot be occasion'd by their Climate, be∣cause the <HI>Swedes, Moscovites,</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> live
<PB N="190" REF="101"/>
all under the same Parallel, and yet enjoy not the like Vigour and Health, and therefore must proceed,</P>
<P>First, From their Diet, which as to Meat is generally fresh roasted Flesh (for they scarce ever eat any boyl'd or salt) and Fowl, which encreases the volatile and fix'd Salts, and thence comes their Vigour and Vivacity.</P>
<P>Secondly, From their Drink, which is spiri∣tuous and strong, being chiefly <HI>Hungarian</HI> Wine burnt, or Aniseed Water, both which they guzzle down in great Quantities almost all the Day long. The poorer Sort have a Liquor distill'd from Wheat, Oats, or Bar∣ley, which the Gentry rectifie with Anniseeds or Aromaticks.</P>
<P>Thirdly, From their living hardily, for they hate Effeminacy, and a poor Country Cottage pleases them as well as a Palace, and they frequently weave Tapistry and Arras, as they travel along upon the Roads.</P>
<P>Nay, many of them will sleep in Time of Frost and Snow without any Bed or other Conveniency, and the little Children, two Months after they are born, have been seen carry'd about stark naked.</P>
<P>Fourthly, from hunting, which is very much in Use among them, and particularly of a wild Beast which they call <HI>Zubra,</HI> having no cloven Feet. They eat these Animals, which they find only in <HI>Lithuania.</HI> The <HI>Poles</HI> are ex∣treamly addicted to, and expert in Horseman∣ship, which might probably occasion the Arms of <HI>Lithuania.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="101"/>
Fifthly, From other Exercises, for the <HI>Poles</HI> are very much enclin'd to Dancing, Leaping, Vaulting, Jumping, &amp;c. as likewise exceed∣ingly given to Talking and Conversation, wherein they agree with the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, Their Beds, Fasting, and Tempe∣rance in Eating, very much contribute towards their living long; for hard Beds knit their Bones, and Temperance refines their Spirits. The Slaves among them have no Beds, and the Masters seldom use any but Quilts, and the like.</P>
<P>And seventhly, Their Health, Vigour, and Vivacity may reasonably be augmented by their great Freedom and Privileges; for where Slavery hebetates and blunts the Mind, and consequently enervates the Body, Liber∣ty exhilerates the one, and by that means strengthens the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com∣plexion, Constituti∣on, &amp;c.</NOTE> The Complexion of the <HI>Poles</HI> is generally enclining to fair, as likewise their Hair to a pale Yellowish Colour. Their Stature is commonly of the middle Sort, tho' a little tending to the tallest. Their Constitutions are generally good, and their Bodies gross, yet the Women of Quality make it their chief Study to make themselves lean and slim: But Painting and Washes to meliorate their Complexions they abhor, neither have they any Occasion for them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners of the <HI>Polish</HI> Men.</NOTE> The <HI>Polish</HI> Men cut their Hair about their Ears like Monks, as I observ'd in the first Vo∣lume of this History. They raze away all the Hair from their Faces, leaving only one large
<PB N="192" REF="102"/>
Whisker. They walk gravely with a Poll-Ax in their Hands, and a Sabre by their Sides, which they never put off but when they go to Bed. This Sabre hangs by a Strap of Leather, to which is also fastened a Hankercheif, a Knife and Sheath, and a small Stone set in Silver to whet their Knife upon. They wash their Faces and Necks eve∣ry Morning in cold-Water, and the Fathers are accustom'd to make their Children to wash themselves as soon as they are stirring, even in the sharpest Weather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fur∣ther Cha∣racter.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> are generally open-hearted and honest (as <HI>Boterus</HI> observes in his Relations) more apt to be deceiv'd than to deceive, and not so easily provok'd as appeas'd. They are likewise for the most part very dutiful to their Magistrates, and courteous and hospita∣ble to Strangers, which last they will not on∣ly invite to their Houses and freely converse with, but also endeavour to imitate. I have known some (says <HI>Hauteville)</HI> that have en∣tertain'd <HI>French Men, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> whom they did not know, meerly because they were out of Employment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Education and Lear∣ning.</NOTE> From their greenest Years they apply themselves to Letters, yet which generally speaking, seldom extends much beyond a perfect Knowledge of the Latin and their own Language, altho they have not however all along wanted for famous Mathematicians, Historians, Orators, Philosophers, and Poets; as likewise for learned Physicians, Lawyers, and Divines; some of which have illustrated
<PB N="193" REF="102"/>
both the Church and their Native Country with their Writings. And doubtless the Learned would have been oblig'd to more of their Nation had not their Works perish'd for Want of Printing, which Art has been but lately receiv'd among them. Your Lord∣ship will find no People with whom you may more generally converse in Latin, and where all Records are written in that Language: The Women also learn Latin in the Nunne∣ries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To what generaly apply them∣selves.</NOTE> The Adult among the Plebeians generally addict themselves, the Men to Trade or Agriculture, and the Women to good House∣wifry. The Gentry also apply themselves to serve the Church or State. Yet both Gentry and Commonalty are often given to Travel, and easily imbibe the Idioms of foreign Nati∣ons. Their Parts are sprightly and active, yet nevertheless more apt for Imitation than Invention. Formerly the <HI>Poles</HI> were not much given to Trafick, but now, by the Ex∣ample of their Neighbours who came to trade among them, they strive to outvy each other in Riches and Covetousness; yet for the most part they love to make a Show, and will ap∣pear very splendid upon the least Occasions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Worst part of their Character.</NOTE> For the worst Part of their Character we must observe with <HI>Barclay,</HI> that they run mad after Liberty, and rather drive than in∣vite their Kings to observe their Laws. They not only hate the Name of Slavery, but likewise abhor a just and hereditary Monar∣chy. The Gentry claim prerogatives that
<PB N="194" REF="103"/>
will scarce give them Leave to be guilty of any Crime, and whenever they happen to ac∣knowledge any such, the Prince has seldom a Power to punish it. They are not only li∣centious in their Morals and a civil Life, but likewise in Religion and sacred Observances, for without Fear of Ecclesiastical Censures, they will both talk and act as they please against that Function, affirming themselves self-sufficient to be their own Guides in those Matters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Genius how enclin'd.</NOTE> Their Genius enclines them generally to Arms, tho' they fall far short of their ancient Glory, by reason there are now so few pub∣lick spirited Persons among them, each ha∣ving greater Regard to his own private Inte∣rest and Gain, than either the Honour or Safety of his Country. Nevertheless not all have been of this Character, for several of latter Days have approv'd themselves worthy Patriots, and couragious Defenders of the Republick, and for the most part they are still good Soldiers, providing there appears any Money or other Reward to push them on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enur'd to Hardship.</NOTE> It is probable they would be almost invin∣cible were they but well Disciplin'd, for they are so inur'd to Hardship, that they look up∣on even the <HI>Germans</HI> to be an Effeminate Sort of People, not fitting to support the Fatigues of War, and the Rigour of Weather. The <HI>Polish</HI> Army has been known to lie encamp'd in the Snow, which it did in the Year 1663. for King <HI>Casimir</HI> set forth from <HI>Leopol</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> and did not return
<PB N="195" REF="103"/>
from the Frontiers of <HI>Moscovy</HI> till the Spring of the Year following.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greedy of Money.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> are so very greedy of Money, that there is scarce any thing they will refuse to obtain it; but when they have once got it, tho they borrow it, they never think of Pay∣ment or Restitution; nay, they will laugh at such as demand it of them, bidding them go use the same Means as they did to get it: This one would think should altogether in∣terrupt Commerce and Trade; therefore it would not be here amiss to inform your Lord∣ship how they Lend and Borrow in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Lending and Borow∣ing.</NOTE> It must first be observ'd that Bonds and Obligations are of no Use there, for when the Gentlemen borrow of one another, they mortgage their Lands or Villages, and when they borrow of the Tradesmen or Merchants, they always leave Pledges, and besides pay 14 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which is allow'd by the Laws of the Land. But providing the Summ so bor∣row'd be not paid within a Time prescrib'd, then is the Creditor at Liberty to dispose of the Pledge without any Account to be given.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Love to make a Fi∣gure.</NOTE> As I observ'd before, the <HI>Poles</HI> love to make a Show, keeping a Multitude of Ser∣vants, and great Store of Horses and Arms for that Purpose: But more especially, they affect to go splendidly cloath'd, yet still ra∣ther according to their several Conditions than Qualities. They have formerly de∣lighted much in foreign Modes, and their Soldiers, have been the first Introducers of
<PB N="196" REF="104"/>
their Fashions, for Example; when they had Wars with the <HI>Moscovites,</HI> according to the Mode of that Country, they wore large long Gowns, lin'd throughout with rich Furrs, as likewise very broad-brim'd and high-crown'd Hats. Afterwards when they were engag'd against the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Valachia,</HI> they chang'd their Fashions to the <HI>Turkish</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Habits: And after that to the <HI>Suedish</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Modes, when they were in War with the <HI>Suedes</HI> in <HI>Prussia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pre∣sent Fashi∣ons.</NOTE> Their present Fashion is, A Vest that reaches down to the middle of their Legs, with a long Robe, not unlike our Morning Gowns, lin'd with Furr, and ty'd about their Wastes with a Sash; Little Boots with Iron Heels, on their Legs, and Furr'd Caps upon their Heads with a Sabre or Cutlace girt about their Loins. When they appear on Horseback, which is one of their chief Delights, they wear besides all that has been mention'd, a short Cloak that hangs over their Shoulders, much like an <HI>Irish</HI> Mantle; which is most commonly Furr'd within and without.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Furrs us'd.</NOTE> The better (that is the Richer) sort make use of the Furrs of Sables, which are brought from <HI>Moscovy,</HI> when the others content them∣selves with the Skins of Tygers, Leopards, Panthers, and a kind of Grey Furrs. Some of the finest of these Furrs cost above a Thou∣sand Crowns; but they are worn only at <HI>Diets,</HI> and descend from Father to Son. The Fashion the Women use, comes nearer to that of the Men than in most Countries.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="104"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rusticks Habit in <HI>Lithuania.</HI></NOTE> In <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the meaner sort make Shoes of Bark of Trees, which they wrap about, and put under the Soles of their Feet. These Shoes they call <HI>Chodakys.</HI> Of the tenderest Bark also they make Stockings, turning and winding it about the Calves of their Legs. Before they come into any Town, they always take care to put on fresh <HI>Chodakys.</HI> These every Countryman almost makes; so that it is commonly us'd as a Jest in <HI>Poland, That there are more Shoomakers in</HI> Lithuania, <HI>than in all</HI> Europe <HI>besides.</HI> The same People likewise wear a sort of Habit, with Sleeves woven all of a Piece. This they call <HI>Samodzialka.</HI> It is commonly Gray and very thick, and worn equally by Men and Women among the Ru∣sticks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A few fol∣low the <HI>French</HI> Mode.</NOTE> Some few of the <HI>Poles</HI> imitate the <HI>French</HI> Fashion, and wear Linnen, Lace, Point, Pe∣rukes, and Swords; for those who retain the <HI>Polish</HI> Habit, have no other Linnen but Shirts and Drawers, and some of them Socks. The ordinary sort of Gentry, and even some of the Great Men, put sifted Chaff into their Boots, which serves them instead of Socks. When I speak of the <HI>Poles</HI> wearing Linnen, I mean only the Gentry and Citizens; for the Peasants wear none at all, unless some by chance happen to have Shirts of Course Cloth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Womens former and late Fashi∣ons.</NOTE> The Women formerly had only Garlands on their Heads, compos'd of Gold, Gems, Flowers, Silk, and the like; but now they wear Silk Caps lin'd with Furr, like the Men.
<PB N="198" REF="105"/>
They also formerly imitated the Women of Foreign Countries; and in the late Reign all the Women of Quality, particularly those that resided at Court, follow'd the <HI>French</HI> Mode, King <HI>John</HI> III's Queen being of that Nation. Never does the Price hinder their having fine things; for they suffer themselves to be Bubbled by Foreign Merchants (espe∣cially <HI>French)</HI> at a ridiculous rate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> great Extrava∣gance.</NOTE> Both Women and Men are Extravagant to an infinite Degree; insomuch that some among them will have fifty Suits of Cloaths at once, all as Rich as possible; but what shews their Prodigality yet more is, that they will almost have their Servants go as well drest as them∣selves; whereby they generally soon spend their Estates, and are reduc'd in a short time, to the extreamest Want. But this Prodigality of theirs does not only extend to their Habits, but likewise to their Buildings, Equipage, and other Customs. In their modern Build∣ings, many of them imitate the <HI>Italians,</HI> tho' generally speaking indeed, their Houses are Small and Low, especially in the Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of their Houses.</NOTE> They never live above Stairs, and their Houses are not united: The Kitchin is on one side, the Stable on another, the House on another, and the Gate in the Front: All which make a Court either Square or Round. These Houses are for the most part of Wood, though the other sort are both of Brick and Stone.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="105"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Furniture.</NOTE> The Inside of their Houses is generally hung with Tapestry or Arras, and all the rest of their Houshold-stuff and Utensils, proportion∣ably suitable: Yet towards <HI>Tartary,</HI> they do not much care to have any Furniture extraordinary for fear of the Incursions of that Barbarous People. Therefore in that part of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Gentry content themselves with a few small Beds with <HI>Taffeta</HI> Curtains, just enough to serve their Family; for if any go to Lodge at their Houses, they generally carry their Beds along with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No Gardens nor Orch∣ards.</NOTE> The <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry have seldom any Gardens or Orchards to their Houses, though their Country be very proper for Fruit-Trees, whereby they might save the Expence of a great deal of Corn, which they consume in Beer, by making of Cider and Perry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Private and publick Baths with their Ef∣fects.</NOTE> Although it be extream Cold in <HI>Poland,</HI> yet will the <HI>Polish</HI> Gentry have almost every one a Bagnio in his House, in which the Women have their Apartments separate from the Men. There are likewise publick Baths in every City and Town for the use of the Common People; which they frequent not only in Summer, but also in Winter. From their frequent use of Baths, probably comes the reason that the <HI>Polish</HI> Children are seldom Scabby, either in Head or Face. It may be here also observ'd, that the Children in <HI>Po∣land</HI> are seldom distorted, crooked, or ill∣shap'd, as it often happens in other Coun∣tries, because here they do not Swath their
<PB N="200" REF="106"/>
Children, but only wrap them loose in Linnen Clouts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> great admirers of Shows.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> are generally so great Admirers of Splendour and Show, that their Women seldom stir out of Doors without a Coach and Six, though it be only cross the way, ei∣ther to Church, or to Visit a Neighbour; but the Men for the most part go on Horseback, and rarely on Foot, which they look upon to be very Ignoble.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Aten∣dants.</NOTE> Both Men and Women are always atten∣ded with a great Number of Servants of both Sexes: The Women to wait on the Women, and the Men on the Men. The Principal <HI>Senators</HI> always Ride or Walk, in the middle of their Retinue, putting the best Cloath'd of their Servants before them. When the Gen∣try of either Sex go abroad a Nights, they have twenty four or more Whitewax <HI>Flam∣beaux</HI> carried before their Coach. Women of Quality generally have their Trains born up by He or She-Dwarfs. These Ladies have also with them an Old Woman, which they call their <HI>Governante;</HI> and an Old Gen∣tleman for their Gentleman-Usher, whose Office is to follow their Coach on Foot, and to help them out of it when they Alight. It may be remark'd, that their Coaches go al∣ways very slow and gravely.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Women ve∣ry Modest.</NOTE> The reason of these two Old Peoples wait∣ing on the Ladies, is not because their Hus∣bands are Jealous, as in most of the Eastern Countries; for the <HI>Polish</HI> Ladies are generally
<PB N="201" REF="106"/>
very Modest; and do not at all abuse the great Liberty allow'd them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exception.</NOTE> But this Rule does not hold among the Common People; for Maids with them, ne∣ver think themselves awhit the worse for be∣ing unmarried Mothers: Nor is their Frailty any hinderance to their Fortune; for they soon Marry again, and thereby repair the Scandal. These sort of Grass-Widdows, most commonly serve for Nurses; for a Vir∣tuous Marry'd Woman, though she be never so Poor, will hardly ever Nurse any Child but her own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Women's Liberty re∣strain'd.</NOTE> It may be observ'd, notwithstanding all these Honours done the Women in <HI>Poland,</HI> that they do neither keep the Purse, nor wear the Breeches; for when they have a mind to have any thing, they are oblig'd to ask their Husbands for it by Kneeling, Em∣bracing his Knees, and calling him their <HI>Be∣nefactor,</HI> except some few Trifles, of course allow'd them; As Butter and Eggs after the House is serv'd; and Flax ready hitchell'd by the Peasants; all which indeed they may dispose of without their Husband's Privity; but as to other Things they cannot: For the Man is the sole Manager of all Things in <HI>Po∣land;</HI> and the Women have little more to do than to Eat, Drink, and Divert themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Indifferences in the <HI>Po∣lish</HI> Temper.</NOTE> As the <HI>Poles</HI> bear their own Losses, and suf∣fer all Disasters with a great deal of Temper, so likewise they regard the Miseries and Mis∣fortunes of others with the same Indifference, for they will often stand and see a House burn
<PB N="202" REF="107"/>
without offering in the least to lend a helping Hand to quench it. Neither are they more indulgent to their Children, or on the con∣trary, the Children to their Parents, both whom are reciprocally suffer'd to continue Slaves to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> when but a small Summ of Money would purchase their Re∣demption.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Ex∣ercises Pra∣ctis'd.</NOTE> In <HI>Poland</HI> there are neither Academies nor Schools, for the <HI>Manege</HI> (Riding the Great Horse) Fencing nor Dancing, and yet the Gentry being naturally bent to those Exer∣cises, will either Practise them at home after their own rude Fashion, or Travel to inform themselves of Strangers abroad. Of all these Pastimes, Musick and Dancing are their Dar∣ling Pleasures; for even the very Nurses are order'd to teach their Children this last as soon as they can go. So that you shall often see two Children tripping it about a Room to the dull Notes of their Nurses, or a Ser∣vants Pipes. The <HI>Poles</HI> are so addicted to Musick, that Barge-men may be frequently seen Playing on Fiddles as they Sail along the River <HI>Vistula</HI> with Corn.</P>
<P>The other Customs and Manners of the <HI>Poles</HI> I shall inform your Lordship of as me∣thodically and succinctly as the Variety of Matter will admit. But first a word or two of the <HI>Polish</HI> Families and Names.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polish</HI> Fa∣milies and,</NOTE> The Gentry are divided into many Tribes, all distinguish'd, not by Places or Countries, but by several peculiar Appellatives and Coats of Arms: Out of every one of these, springs
<PB N="203" REF="107"/>
several Families of different Names and Affi∣nity. For example, to the Tribe of <HI>Lelivicz,</HI> whose Standard is a Field <HI>Azure,</HI> charg'd with a New Moon in <HI>chief,</HI> and a Star of the first Magnitude between its Horns, belong the Families of <HI>Zarnowiski, Pileczki, Melstin,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Names for∣merly and now.</NOTE> Formerly the <HI>Poles</HI> had their Names from several occasions; but of latter days they have been accustom'd to take them only from Ca∣stles, Cities, Towns and Villages, most com∣monly by adding the Termination <HI>ski</HI> or <HI>ki,</HI> which signifies <HI>Son,</HI> though some say <HI>Domini∣on,</HI> because they are generally so call'd from the Place which they Govern. In <HI>Lithuania</HI> the Termination for the most part is in <HI>witz,</HI> which rather implies <HI>Son</HI> than <HI>Ski.</HI> Sometimes also they take their Names from these Places by omitting <HI>Ski</HI> and <HI>Witz,</HI> and putting before the Place, <HI>à, ab, in,</HI> or <HI>de:</HI> As <HI>à Gorka, in Tenstin, de Fulstin,</HI> and the like. Some of the <HI>Poles</HI> usual Names are (which I mention for the difficulty of Pronunciation.) <HI>Chrzonstow∣ski, Krzikritzki, Grzmialtowski,</HI> &amp;c. Lastly, Several Names in <HI>Poland</HI> begin with an <HI>O,</HI> as <HI>Opalinski, Osolmski, Ʋzaorwski, Orzakowski,</HI> and such like.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages and their duration.</NOTE> Now as to Marriages among the <HI>Poles,</HI> it must first be observ'd, that the Feasts of those of the Gentry always last three days, be they that make them either Poor or Rich; where∣fore they must necessarily be exceeding Ex∣pensive. If a Lady Marry any of her waiting Maids, she generally Expends as much as for one of her Daughters. But as the Court-Marriages
<PB N="204" REF="108"/>
will shew the greatest Magnificence of this kind, I shall entertain your Lordship out of <HI>Hauteville</HI> with one of that sort.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Court-Mar∣riages.</NOTE> When the Queen Marries any of her Maids of Honour, or when any <HI>Senator</HI> or great Lord is to be Marry'd, the first and second day the King gives a great Feast. For this purpose a large Hall is pitch'd upon, where there are three Tables set out. At the first Table sit the King and Queen, in a Manner that they both Face the Hall. Next the Queen sit the Two that are to be Married; and next to the King the Popes <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna.</HI> At the same Table likewise sit the Foreign Embassadors over against the King and Queen. At the two other Tables, ex∣tending the whole length of the Hall, all the Ladies, Senators and Officers, except only such as wait on the King and Queen, are plac'd by an Officer, according to their respective Precedence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs thereat.</NOTE> Most commonly this Feast begins about four or five of the Clock in the Afternoon, and lasts to two or three in the Morning. Here it may be observ'd that the <HI>Senators</HI> are accustom'd to rise often, and go up to the King's Table to drink his Majesty's Health on their Knees. At these Feasts they eat lit∣tle, but drink <HI>Hungarian</HI> Wine to an immo∣derate Degree. The Ladies, out of Mode∣sty, only touch the Tops of the Glasses with their Lips, and so set them down before them, or pour them into their Plates, in a manner tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more Wine is thought to be spils
<PB N="205" REF="108"/>
and lost here than drank. When they have sate about five or six Hours at Table, the Violins, and a little Sort of portable Organs begin to strike up, and then they spend the rest of the Time in Dancing. In this Exer∣cise every body joyns, and not so much as the old People of either Sex are excus'd. Those that begin the Dance are generally the anci∣ent <HI>Senators</HI> and old Ladies who move slowly about, like so many Fryars or Nuns in Pro∣cession; but altho the Dancing begins with so much Gravity and Formality, yet it usually ends with a great deal of Hurry and Confusi∣on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents made the Bride.</NOTE> On the second Day all the Guests present the Bride with something new, and none give less than a small Piece of Plate. All these Presents are made before the Queen. This Ceremony is perform'd before they sit down to Table. These Presents most common∣ly make a good Part of the Brides Portion. The late Princess of <HI>Poland,</HI> when she was marry'd to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> had above the Value of 100000 Crowns presented her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Espousals and Cere∣monies.</NOTE> On the third Day are solemniz'd the Es∣pousals: All the Wedding Guests accompa∣ny the Bridegroom and Bride on Horse-back to Church, as likewise in their Return Home, when they are always to pass by the King's Palace. During all the Time of their coming and going, the Trumpets sound from the Balconies on both Sides the way. When the Bride has been conducted to her Hus∣band's
<PB N="206" REF="109"/>
House, and a magnificent Feast there prepar'd is ended, and the Company gone, the Bride begins to fall a crying, it being the Custom it seems in <HI>Poland</HI> for Maids to weep at that time, and to seem concern'd for fear they should be thought impudent and im∣modest. The other Marriages of the Gentry in <HI>Poland,</HI> are perform'd much after the same Manner, only with less Magnificence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who not Married without Dispensati∣on.</NOTE> The Men and the Women that are Godfa∣thers and Godmothers to Children, are always Cousins and Relations, tho they were not so before, and consequently cannot be marry'd without a Dispensation from the Bishop of the Diocess.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burials and order of Procession.</NOTE> The Ceremonies of Burial in <HI>Poland</HI> are usually celebrated with so great Pomp and Magnificence, that one would rather take them for Triumphs than Enterments. The Corps having been put into the Coffin, it is plac'd in a Herse or Chariot with six Horses, all cover'd with black Housings, The Coffin has a large black Velvet Pall thrown over it, with a Cross of red Satin in the Middle, and six long black Silk Tassels hanging down from it, which are born up by as many of the deceas'd Person's Domesticks, all in close Mourning. Before the Chariot march several Priests, Monks, and a great Number of Peo∣ple, each of which carries a white Wax Torch lighted in his Hand, next to whom, and immediately before the Herse come three Men on Horseback who carry the Arms
<PB N="207" REF="109"/>
of the deceased, one his Sword, another his Lance, and the third his Dart.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Pro∣ceedings.</NOTE> The Procession thus set out, marches very slowly, in a manner that they usually come late to the Church. After the Burial-Service is over, those that carry'd the Armour enter the Church on Horse-back, and furiously ri∣ding up to the Coffin, break the Arms of the deceas'd thereupon; after which the Body is Inter'd. Then they return to the House, where there is always a great Feast prepar'd, when the Lay-Guests will not only drink to Excess, but likewise force the Clergy to fol∣low their Example.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particulars relating to the King and Queens Enterment.</NOTE> Here it may not be amiss to observe some∣thing relating to the Interment of the King and Queen of <HI>Poland.</HI> As soon as the King dies he is laid upon a Bed of State, and a certain Number of the <HI>Senators,</HI> both Ecclesi∣astical and Temporal, are appointed to at∣tend about his Corps. The Republick also orders all necessary Expences relating hereun∣to, to be levied out of the Crown Revenues. A deceas'd Queen likewise has the same Cere∣monies and Honours as a King; for Queen <HI>Mary Ludovica</HI> Wife to <HI>John Casimir,</HI> was carry'd from the Suburbs of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> where she dy'd, to the Castle where she lay in State, till she was carry'd to <HI>Cracow</HI> to be buried.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of <HI>J. Casimir's</HI> Queens Death.</NOTE> It may not be improper to entertain your Lordship with the Manner of her Death, there being something observable in it. She dy'd of a Defluxion upon her Lungs, or of a
<PB N="208" REF="110"/>
Consumption, occasion'd by Excess of Passi∣on, on Account of a Contest she had had with the Chancellour <HI>Patz</HI> about something she had propos'd to him which he would not consent to. This Princess lov'd so dearly to intermeddle with, and to govern the State solely according to her Fancy, that she was not a little jealous when the King her Hus∣band spake to any other Women, and that chiefly for fear he might en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line to be go∣vern'd by another more than her self. This your Lordship may imagine gave him no great Cause to be concern'd at her Death, for at the very Instant of her expiring, he posted away to a Mistriss he had formerly lov'd, but whom he durst not have spoke to du∣ring his Queen's Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Mourning in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> As Mourning is not only a necessary Cir∣cumstance, but also the Sequel of a Funeral, so I think my self oblig'd here to give some short Account of it. The Mourning of the Men is much like ours, only differing ac∣cording to the Habits of the Country; but the Women of Quality are generally appa∣rell'd in a Sort of coarse black Stuff, and their Linnen is not much finer than Canvass, and the greater the Quality, always the coarser the Linnen and Stuff. This Habit does not misbecome Widows that are both young and handsome. It may here be observ'd, that the Senators, Deputies, and all others that have a Mind to appear at the <HI>Diet</HI> of Election, must be in Black, tho' the Fashions of the se∣veral Countries of Foreigners are not requir'd in like manner to be alter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edibles a∣mong the <HI>Poles.</HI></NOTE> For the other Customs of eating and drinking among the <HI>Poles,</HI> both at Feasts and elsewhere, they are various, but first I must give some Account of the Edibles and Pota∣bles. Their ordinary Meat is Beef and Veal, for Mutton they do not value, and generally give it to their Servants. They have great Store of grey, but no red Partridges; a great many Hares, but no Rabits, for they would sooner eat a Cat than these last. They have 'tis true, some white Rabbets which they breed tame for the Sake of their Furrs. In <HI>Poland</HI> there are a great many Roe-bucks, but few Stags: Abundance of wild Boars, Hogs, Poultry, Pigeons, and the like: But as for wild-Foul, they have great Store in∣deed in Summer, but none in Winter, as in other Countries, when they are best. They have a great many wild Oxen, which, when moderately salted, are great Dainties with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Hunting wild Oxen.</NOTE> The Manner of hunting these wild Oxen it may not be improper here to give some short Account of; when they have surrounded the Beast with a great Number of Horsemen, each of them rides up to him and darts him with an Arrow, when the Beast feeling him∣selfwounded, eagerly pursues its Enemy, while another Person darting him from be∣hind, he turns in great Rage after that Per∣son, and then another darting him, as like∣wise many others successively; at length the poor Beast is so tir'd with pursuing so many Assailants, that he falls down and is easily
<PB N="210" REF="111"/>
taken or kill'd. They have another way of taking them in the Woods, which is by cau∣sing the Rusticks to enclose a great Number of them with Trees feil'd down, who also im∣mediately raise up a Stage for Spectators; when the Hunters, assigning themselves, eve∣ry one a Post, and the Beasts being frighted into the Middle by Dogs and the great Voci∣feration of the Assailants, as they move to∣wards each Person, they are wounded with Darts, which making them to run with great Force against their Enemy, and finding an Opposition by the Trees, they endeavour to force their Way, whilst the Hunter from be∣hind, most commonly gives them their Deaths Wound; but if they happen to break thro' then the next Hunter holds out a Piece of red Cloath, which it seems, this Beast having an Antipathy against, forthwith leaves that Person and runs at the other, who being pro∣vided for him, most commonly kills him, or in Case of Danger, his Neighbour has Recourse to the aforesaid Stratagem which ne∣ver fails of diverting the Fury of this wild Beast. It may be also observ'd that this Beast has a Power of drawing a Man to him with his Tongue, it being rough, if he can but reach any Part of his Coat, or the like.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Odd Dain∣ties.</NOTE> Near the Mountains of <HI>Hungary,</HI> there are also wild Goats which they admire mightily for Meat. They likewise make a fine Dish, as they think it, of Beavers Tails, but throw away the Body. They likewise eat Bears Paws when pickled, for Dainties. When
<PB N="211" REF="111"/>
they take or kill <HI>Elks;</HI> they do not gut them for fourteen or fifteen Days afterwards, and sometimes in Winter, not in a whole Month. When the Great Men come to the <HI>Diet,</HI> they commonly bring these with their Skins and Guts, and hang them at their Windows some five or six at a Time, until they turn rank like Venison; then they roast some, and dress others like Beef <HI>a la mode.</HI> This is esteem'd delicious Meat, and none but Great Mens Tables have it. The Manner of taking Bears also I presume may not be unaccepta∣ble to your Lordship.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of taking Bears.</NOTE> They are generally taken with Nets, even tho' they be of the largest Size: When they have hamper'd one, all the Hunters ride in great Numbers about him, and having pinn'd down his Head and Feet with great wooden Forks, they bind him every way about with strong hempen Cords that he is not able to stir, then they roul him into a great wooden Cage, but it must be understood that the Knots of the Cords are so contriv'd, that with one artful Pull they may be unloos'd, af∣ter which the Bear is kept so shut up till they have a mind to let him forth, by lifting up a Trap Door, to be hunted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other sorts of Fowl.</NOTE> In <HI>Poland</HI> likewise they have a great many Heath-Cocks, most of which are of the Big∣ness of a Capon: There are also abundance of Pheasants in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and of Bustards in <HI>Prussia.</HI> They have moreover about <HI>Lowitz,</HI> a little Bird not unlike a large Sparrow, which comes and disappears with the Snow,
<PB N="212" REF="112"/>
and thence is call'd a <HI>Snow-Bird.</HI> These are very agreeable to the Taste. As for tame-Fowl, the <HI>Poles</HI> never eat any but such as is brought alive into their Kitchins in the Morning and kill'd for Dinner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Fish they have.</NOTE> For Fish, the <HI>Baltick</HI> being the only Sea that borders upon <HI>Poland,</HI> has scarce any, but that Defect is abundantly supply'd by the great Plenty of fresh Water Fish, both in their Lakes and Rivers; some Sorts whereof are not to be found in other Countries. It may be observ'd, that those which are taken out of Rivers, are more palatable than those bred in Lakes and the Sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of or∣dering Cab∣bage.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> have a peculiar way of ordering Cabbage. They chop it small, and put it in∣to a Tub between Lays of Salt, then they press it very hard, and after pour warm Wa∣ter upon it, which makes it ferment▪ and serves for Pickle: Thus they preserve it all Winter, and sometimes for a whole Twelve∣month. Tho' this Dainty of theirs smells very strong at a Distance, yet do they ne∣vertheless think it good Meat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Po∣tables.</NOTE> Their Potables are of different Kinds, but their usual Drink is Beer, which in <HI>Prussia</HI> is made only of Malt, but in the rest of <HI>Poland,</HI> with Wheat ground small, and boyl'd with Hops; sometimes they mixt <HI>Spelt</HI> (a Kind of Wheat in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders)</HI> and Oats along with it▪</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="112"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beer of what Qua∣lity.</NOTE> Their Beer is generally of an Amber Co∣lour, and of a brisk and poignant Sweetness, especially that of <HI>Varka,</HI> or that which the Gentry make for their private Use, which is stronger and better than the Brewers fell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorts of Mead.</NOTE> In <HI>Lithuania, Russia,</HI> and <HI>Ʋkrania,</HI> they have two Sorts of Liquor made with Honey which are red and white, both which they call <HI>Mead,</HI> tho'we give that Name only to the latter, the former with us being <HI>Methe∣glin: Prussia</HI> and <HI>Masovia</HI> also has some Ho∣ney, tho' at <HI>Warsaw</HI> it is made after a pecu∣liar Manner, by mixing Juice of Cherries and Blackberries, as likewise Aromaticks along with it, and thence has the several differing Names of <HI>Kerstrang, Malinicz,</HI> and <HI>Troi∣nicz.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And of Wine.</NOTE> Besides Beer and Mead, both the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Lithuanians</HI> have several Sorts of Wine brought from <HI>Hungary, Italy, France,</HI> and <HI>Germany:</HI> That of <HI>Hungary</HI> excels the <HI>Spanish</HI> in Strength, and is brought to <HI>Cracow</HI> over the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains in large Casks drawn by Oxen. The best is sold at twenty Shillings a <HI>Polish</HI> Pot, which amounts to no more than three of our Quarts, so that we may reasonably believe that the poorer Sort are oblig'd to obstain from so costly a Li∣quor. The <HI>Italian</HI> Wine is brought likewise over-Land, but not drank so much as the other, by reason of its Lushiousness and Price, being brought much farther. The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wines come by way of the <HI>Baltic</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="113"/>
to <HI>Dantzic.</HI> These, as they are naturally weaker than the former, so they lose much of their Strength by coming by Sea. As to the <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine, that seldom goes much beyond <HI>Dantzic,</HI> altho' some be sold in other Parts of <HI>Prussia,</HI> yet which they always drink with Sugar, by Reason of its Sharp∣ness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What strong Wa∣ters.</NOTE> Strong Waters in <HI>Poland</HI> are generally Spirits drawn from Wheat, Barley, Oats, Sider, &amp;c. and mixt with Water, but these are only drank by the common People, un∣less in Winter, when the Gentry likewise drink them, but they then are rectify'd with Aniseeds and other Aromaticks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs in Eating and Drinking.</NOTE> For their Customs in eating and drinking, it must be observ'd, that they seldom or ne∣ver eat any Breakfasts, and do not care for cold Meat. In the Mornings both Men and Women generally drink Ginger, Yolks of Eggs and Sugar boyl'd in Beer. They are immoderate Lovers of Pig roasted, tho' their Sauces have commonly an odd Taste. The Great Men seldom dine without a Dish of Peas and yellow rusty Bacon slic'd, which it seems they prefer. They eat all manner of Mushrooms, not excepting those that cleave to the Trees, which they gather and dry, to preserve them. Those of above a Nights Growth, we commonly esteem Poyson, and which perhaps may be so here and not there, no more than Poppy Seeds, which they like∣wise eat in great Quantities, for they drink the Milk of them, as also make it into several
<PB N="215" REF="113"/>
Sauces or Dishes by it self. They also make abundance of Oyl of this Seed, as likewise of Hemp and Flax Seeds, &amp;c. which they eat on fasting Days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Potage and Sauces.</NOTE> They seldom eat any <HI>Potage,</HI> unless what the <HI>French</HI> Cooks make, which they will feast on with a great deal of Pleasure. They do not boil their Meat over much, and that gives it the better Relish. Their Sauces also differ extreamly from ours; some whereof are yellow and made with Saffron; others white, consisting chiefly of Cream; a third Sort grey, being of Onyons; and a fourth black, being made with the Juice of Plums. Into these Sauces they put a great Quantity of Sugar, or sometimes Pepper, Cynamon, and sometimes Ginger, Cloves, Nutmeg, Olives, Capers, Kernels of Pine Apples, and Prunes. Their Fish Sauces excel both ours and the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Poles</HI> use Spices to that Degree, that some Great Men have been found to spend above fifty thousand Livres a-Year in that single Commodity: They do not want for all Sorts of choice Potherbs, and some that are not to be found elsewhere. They have also Sweet-Meats of various Kinds, and all Manner of <HI>Deserts,</HI> especially <HI>Pistacho</HI> Nuts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> eat little Bread.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> generally eat a great deal of Meat to a very little Bread, altho they have such Plenty of Corn in <HI>Poland,</HI> especially Rye, which is much better than in other Countries. They are great Admirers of
<PB N="216" REF="114"/>
Roots, which they dress different Ways, and very palatably.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crachat how made.</NOTE> They have a Sort of Dish which they call <HI>Crachat,</HI> and which is made of the coarse Meal of Wheat, Barley, Millet, or Oats, or sometimes of a small Grain call'd by them <HI>Manna.</HI> This <HI>Crachat</HI> is very good when well dress'd. On Flesh Days they eat it with Milk and Butter, and on Fasting Days only with Oyl: But notwithstanding there are some who dispense with this Rule, espe∣cially on <HI>Saturdays.</HI> The common People, for want of Wheat or the like, are accu∣stom'd to make Bread of Acorns dry'd and ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs at Feasts.</NOTE> When the <HI>Poles</HI> make a Feast, they never serve at Table either Spoons, Knives, or Forks, but the Guests are to bring those along with them, or their Servants for them. They also have a broad Piece of starch'd Lin∣nen to serve for Napkins, sow'd round the Table Cloath for fear it should be stollen away. The Guests being set down at Table, immediately the Gates of the House are shut, and are not open'd till all the Company are risen, and the Plate taken Account of and lock'd up; for should it be otherwise, the Footmen are generally so light-finger'd, that they would infallibly <HI>Nim</HI> some of it, and this is the Reason also why they do not lay Spoons, Knives and Forks on the Table.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Banquet∣ting Hall.</NOTE> Every Person of any Fashion, has his Ban∣quetting Hall in his House, peculiarly set
<PB N="217" REF="114"/>
a part for Feasts and Entertainments. Here there is a Place made up with Ballasters for the Side-board Table, from which the Cloath is never taken till it is very dirty, being al∣ways loaded with a great Quantity of Plate. Over this Place there is a Gallery for Musick, usually consisting of Violins and Organs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particulars of Servants.</NOTE> Those that are invited, always bring their Footmen along with them, to whom, as soon as they are seated, they cut half their Bread, and as much Meat, and give it over their Shoulders. This Servant being thus provided, stands and eats what is given him behind his Master. If the Master asks twice for Wine, the Servant brings him as much again, and, after his Master, drinks out of the same Glass without rincing. Altho' there are great Quantities of Victuals brought from the Kitchin, yet do they rarely carry any back, for the Servants immediately seize on what is left, and their Ladies make them car∣ry each of them a Napkin to prog for dry'd Sweet-meats or Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners at Table.</NOTE> After the Cloath is taken away, the <HI>Poles</HI> are accustom'd to sit a good while drinking. The Genteelest Part of them, at least, have a very decent way of eating. They never once touch the Meat with their Hands, but carve with so great <HI>Address,</HI> that they dex∣terously cut a Partridge into six Parts in a Trice, holding it on the End of a Fork. While they are eating they mind nothing else, and tho' any body sends in for them, they never stir from Table till they have done.
<PB N="218" REF="115"/>
After their Meals they generally take a Pipe of Tobacco, as the Custom is with us and other Countries, the Manner whereof may not be unpleasant to be related.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> way of taking Tobacco.</NOTE> They generally smoak Tobacco without injuring either their Heads or Stomachs, and that by these Means: They have a Pipe stuck thro' a little round Box, into which they have before put Sponge that had been soak'd in distill'd Vineger; this Sponge, by means of a few little Holes thro' the Pipe, commu∣nicates its Mildness to the Smoak, and be∣sides sucks away all the Oyl of the Tobacco, whereby the Heat is exceedingly lenify'd, and the Pleasure of smoaking consequently im∣prov'd. When they would render smoaking Tobacco yet more agreeable over and above this lenifying the Heat, they have a way of persuming the Smoak, by placing another Box of a lesser Size than the former, nearer to the Bowl of the Pipe, wherein they are wont to put Cotton dipt into some Sort of Essence, which by means of the like Holes made as before within that Box, and thro' the Pipe transmits its odoriferous Quality to the Smoak. They generally place this Box five Inches from the Bowl of the Pipe, and the other as many more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feasts made by turns.</NOTE> These Feasts are made alternatively by every Friend and Relation that are Neigh∣bours, whether Men or Women; for it must▪ be understood that the <HI>Poles</HI> converse freely with the Female Sex, without occasioning them any Scandal, and especially where the
<PB N="219" REF="115"/>
Women are young, if they have but their Parents or nearest Relations along with them. By these Means Matches are fre∣quently promoted and Friendships propaga∣ted or continu'd. Nevertheless sometimes, by immoderate tipling, intestine Jars arise, and bloody Broils ensue; yet that Master of a Feast will always be esteem'd an unreasona∣ble Niggard that does not allow his Guests wherewithal to work them up to such a Pitch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brimmers much pra∣ctis'd.</NOTE> Those we call Brimmers are very much in Request among the <HI>Poles,</HI> for they will scarce ever excuse a Man unless he pledges them <HI>Su∣per-naculum.</HI> This Vice reigns equally in Feasts and Taverns, and Saints Days, are not excepted out of their Drunkards-Calendar, which is notwithstanding wink'd at and tole∣rated on Account of the great Revenues and Excise it brings to the State. However, now a-days this Custom is not so much in Practice among the better Sort of Gentry as formerly, yet they all still retain their anci∣ent Luxuries of other Kinds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs in Traveling.</NOTE> The Customs and Manners of travelling in <HI>Poland,</HI> with other Circumstances, come next to be inspected. It must first be under∣stood, that there are scarce any Inns in this Country, except those the Natives call <HI>Karczma's,</HI> where Travellers are oblig'd to lodge with the Cattle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of Inns.</NOTE> Those Inns, or rather long Stables, are all built up with Boards, and cover'd with Straw.
<PB N="220" REF="116"/>
Within there is no Furniture, neither are there any Windows, but all the Light comes in either at Holes made by the Weather, or the Crevices of ill join'd Boards. 'Tis true, at the further End they have a little Chamber with a Fire-Hearth, but then there is no lodging in it, because of the Flyes, Fleas, Bugs, and especially the noisom Smells that incommode it; for if they happen to have a little Window there, yet do they never open it tho' the Weather be never so hot; so that Strangers choose rather to lye in the aforesaid Stable, where the <HI>Gospodarz</HI> or Inn-Keeper lodges himself with his whole Family, than to be suffocated by the Stink and Smell of so close and small a Room. In the long Room likewise there is an intolerable Smell, occasi∣on'd by a Parcel of rotten Cabbages, which those People always keep by them: And this, tho' it may be agreeable enough to the Na∣tives who are us'd to it, yet to Strangers it must needs be very offensive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Have few Convenien∣cies.</NOTE> In these Inns or Stables, there are no Ta∣bles or Beds, except one of the last in the lit∣tle Room before mention'd, but however scarce any body cares to lye in it, because they can have no Sheets but what are very coarse, and have been often lain in before; neither is the Straw in the Stable much bet∣ter, because, even of that, every Company can't have fresh, for the <HI>Gospodar,</HI> after his Guests are gone, generally gathers it up and preserves it for New-Comers, yet it is still preferable to the Bed, by Reason that he most commonly Airs it after it has been us'd.
<PB N="221" REF="116"/>
All along this <HI>Karczma</HI> or Inn, there are great Numbers of wooden Pins fixt for Tra∣vellers to hang up their Cloaths, Portman∣tues, &amp;c. This Sort of bad Accomodation many avoid by lying in Barns, where they get fresh Straw.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travellers oblig'd to carry Pro∣visions, &amp;c.</NOTE> By Reason of this ill Entertainment on the Roads, all Travellers in this Country are ob∣lig'd to have a Calash with two Horses, wherein they must carry all their Necessaries and Provisions. Their Beds, Quilts, Bol∣sters, Sheets, and the like, are generally put into a large Serge Bag, which afterward serves them instead of a Seat in the Calash. Also they must provide a Case for Bottles of what Drink they please, and a Basket with a Lid for their Meat, Bread, &amp;c. They must moreover furnish themselves with every indi∣vidual thing that they may have occasion for, and take care to renew what they have ex∣hausted whenever they have the first Oppor∣tunity, for there is scarce any thing to be had in these <HI>Karczma's</HI> but that indifferent Lodg∣ing I mention'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travelling cheap in o∣ther re∣spects.</NOTE> Thus your Lordship may perceive that one that travels in <HI>Poland,</HI> must as it were carry his whole House along with him, and besides undergo not a few Incommodities to boot. However, when a Man is thus provi∣ded, he may travel at a very inconsiderable Expence; for Lodging (as indeed it ought not) costs but very little, and there is no∣thing to pay for any thing else, because it can't be got, the Reason I suppose being
<PB N="222" REF="117"/>
that the Gentry of the Country never offer to pay for what they call for, and there is no way to force them to it; so that where they ask for any thing, the <HI>Gospodar</HI> always puts them off with a <HI>Nie Masz,</HI> that is, <HI>I have no∣thing:</HI> Yet nevertheless when they have any thing to spare, they will freely give Part of it to Strangers, tho' generally, there being but few Travellers in that Country, they provide only for their own Families: When Foreigners happen to want for Provisions, they usually apply themselves to the <HI>Dvour,</HI> or <HI>Lord of the Village,</HI> who forthwith supplies them <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> man∣ner of Tra∣velling.</NOTE> <HI>Poland</HI> being for the most part a <HI>Champagne</HI> Country, a Galash and two Horses will rid a great deal of Ground there in a Day. Some of the <HI>Poles</HI> are so provident as to drive their own Calashes themselves, but of these there are but few. When they come to the Inn, they commonly put their Horses to Grass, because the <HI>Gospodarz</HI> will not be easily induc'd to trust them for Hay. There are some like∣wise that travel on Horseback with a Quilt for their Bed about a Foot and half broad, laid under their Saddle. They commonly employ the <HI>Gospodarz</HI> to fetch them in Beer, Bread, and whatever else they have Occasion for, and which Service they must not refuse to do for them at their Peril. Travelling is here so easie to the Gentry, that it costs them little or nothing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Incommodi∣ties in Tra∣vel how re∣medy'd.</NOTE> A Traveller would do well to take more than ordinary Care in passing over Bridges in
<PB N="223" REF="117"/>
this Country, because they are generally very bad and seldom repair'd. In VVinter there is no travelling without a Case for ones Feet, the Air being excessive sharp and keen. This Case is generally a furr'd Sack, tho' Horse∣men content themselves with thick Boots, having some Straw in them to keep their Feet warm. They also take a good large Sip of Strong VVaters before they mount. In passing over the Ice, especially when there is Snow upon it, one must take care to procure a Sledge to put the Calash or Coach in, which is always drawn by Horses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturb'd a Winter Nights by Boors.</NOTE> In VVinter likewise one shall find it a hard Matter to rest a-nights, especially on Holy∣days, because then all the Peasants of the Vil∣lage are gather'd together to Carouse and make merry in that Room where you are ob∣lig'd to lodg for want of a Fire elsewhere, for at that Time there is no sleeping without; Nay, as I said before, scarce with it, tho' a Man be commonly very weary when he comes off a Journey, these Drunkards mak∣ing such a continn'd Din in your Ears with their excessive singing and dancing about the Room.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Danger of losing Noses.</NOTE> I should have observ'd to your Lordship, that sometimes in VVinter Travellers Noses are frozen with the extream Cold, when they must take immediate Care to apply Snow to them, for should they suddenly enter into a warm Room without so doing, they might, for ought I know, endanger losing them.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="118"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners of peculiar Countries.</NOTE> Before I conclude this Account of the Cu∣stoms and Manners of the <HI>Poles,</HI> I might rea∣sonably inform your Lordship of the Manners both ancient and modern, of the <HI>Lithuanians, Samogitians, Prussians,</HI> &amp;c. especially where they differ from those of the other Parts of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Concerning</HI> Lithuania.</NOTE> That we are descended from the ancient Ro∣mans <HI>(says</HI> Michalon <HI>a</HI> Lithuanian <HI>Author)</HI> is past Doubt, since our Language is almost half Latine, and we not long since had the same Cu∣stoms and Ceremonies, as burning the Dead, di∣vining by Augurs, and such like Superstitions: Nay, which we still retain <HI>(continues he)</HI> in many Parts of this Country, especially by worship∣ing the God <HI>Esculapius</HI> under the Form of a Ser∣pent. <HI>This Author reckons up a great many VVords which have the same Signification at present in</HI> Lithuania, <HI>as they had formerly in</HI> Rome. <HI>He thinks likewise the</HI> Romans <HI>Ex∣pedition into this Country was under</HI> Julius Caesar, <HI>and vouches</HI> Florus <HI>for a Proof. He also is of Opinion, that the Cause of this Country's being call'd</HI> The Great Dutchy, <HI>proceeds from the great Number of</HI> Dukes <HI>in∣habiting therein.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What re∣lates to Courts of Justice there.</NOTE> As to what relates to the Courts of Justice in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the tenth Part of the thing adjudg'd in all real Actions, goes always to the Judge's Box, thence call'd <HI>Peressud</HI> (a close Chest) which is immedi∣ately to be paid down in Court: But in per∣sonal Actions, he claims half the Damages
<PB N="225" REF="118"/>
given to the Plaintiff. Murther, &amp;c. is pu∣nish'd by Mulct only, in like manner as in <HI>Poland:</HI> If the Murtherer fly, 'tis usual to preserve the dead Carcass, for that he can∣not be condemn'd till he has been shewn the Body of the Person he has slain. Also a Judge here has all stollen Goods where-ever found.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Former Judges.</NOTE> These Judges are now appointed to be the same as they are in <HI>Poland,</HI> tho' there were formerly but two in all <HI>Lithuania,</HI> both <HI>Pala∣tins,</HI> and who had no peculiar Place of Resi∣dence assign'd, so that all that had Business with them, were oblig'd to follow them, tho' never so far distant; but these Palatins had their Deputies, who were accustom'd to sit and adjudge Differences at publick Feas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but who nevertheless had always greater Re∣gard to the filling of their <HI>Peressud,</HI> than ei∣ther to the Justice or Innocence of the Person offended or offending. Other Particulars re∣lating to these Matters I have omitted for Brevity's sake (altho' for the most part they differ from the Laws of other Countries) presuming they might not probably be ac∣ceptable to your Lordship and the Publick. But I must take notice of the Gentry and Ci∣tizens of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> &amp;c. and so shall proceed to the Rusticks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Gen∣try and Citizens.</NOTE> First then it must be understood, that the <HI>Lithuanian</HI> Gentry were chiefly owing for their Privileges to <HI>Jagello</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and to <HI>Alexander</HI> his Successor in <HI>Lithuania;</HI> both which Princes, that they might the bet∣ter
<PB N="226" REF="119"/>
bring the Natives to embrace the Christi∣an Faith, bestow'd on their Nobility the same Liberty and Privileges as the <HI>Polish</HI> Gen∣try enjoy'd. <HI>Russia</HI> also and <HI>Podolia</HI> had the same Privileges granted them at the same time, and <HI>Prussia</HI> likewise had great Immuni∣ties added to its ancient Privileges by <HI>Cast∣mir</HI> IV. whose Assistance it had implor'd against the <HI>Teutonic</HI> Knights. As for the Ci∣tizens of <HI>Lithuania, Samogitia,</HI> and <HI>Russia,</HI> they are much on the same Foot with the other Parts of <HI>Poland,</HI> only those of <HI>Prussia</HI> are preferr'd in many Cases, as has been ob∣srev'd before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rusticks and their Condition.</NOTE> The Country People in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> &amp;c. are rather more miserable than in <HI>Poland,</HI> for a Gentleman there, attended by a Troop of Servants, will commonly go into a Country-Man's House, and take all he has from him, misusing and beating him shamefully into the Bargain; in which, or any other Case, if the Rustick applies himself to his Lord for redress, he must not come empty handed; and tho' he does not, yet all the Favour he shall obtain, will be to have his Case recom∣mended to the <HI>Starostas</HI> and other Officers, where he must fee again, so that he is gene∣rally unable to go through with the great Charge of getting himself reveng'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Work on Sundays.</NOTE> Whereas these poor Wretches work but three or four Days in a Week for their Lords in <HI>Poland;</HI> in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> &amp;c. they commonly work five or six, <HI>Mondays</HI> only being allow'd to themselves, and in case they have Occasi∣on
<PB N="227" REF="119"/>
for them that Day, then they work on <HI>Sundays</HI> for themselves, for these Boors ob∣serve no manner of Holy-Days: Yet this Custom is more peculiar to <HI>Russia;</HI> for if one should ask a Slave there <HI>Why he works on Sun∣days,</HI> he would answer by a Question, <HI>If he must not eat on Sundays.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pay rigid Duties, &amp;c.</NOTE> These poor Wretches, out of their scanty Gettings, generally pay rigid Duties three or four Times a Year, to the State, besides being oblig'd to satisfie the frequent and arbitrary Impositions of their Lords. If a Slave happens to be condemn'd to Death by his Lord for any Crime, he must be his own Executioner, or will be forc'd to it by Threats of a worse Punishment than hang∣ing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Edi∣bles and Custom at grinding Corn.</NOTE> The Bread they usually live upon, is a coarse black Sort, made of Rye, sooty Wheat, and Barley Ears, all ground toge∣ther. Their Meat is both Flesh, Fish, and Fowl, and what Cattle or Poultry they fore∣see they shall not be able to keep in VVinter, they usually kill in Autumn, and preserve with Salt. They are for the most part good Marks-men, and maintain their Families in a great measure that way. To grind their Corn they have in every House in the Coun∣try, four or five Hand-Mills. VVhile they are at work, they sing continually, and of∣ten repeat the VVord <HI>Melior,</HI> which in their Language signifies the same as in <HI>Latine,</HI> thereby implying, as I suppose, that their Condition is still better than a worse. They
<PB N="228" REF="120"/>
have also a Sort of very long wooden Pipes, which when they found, they always make the Standers by deaf, and usually so grate their Ears, that they do not recover their Hearing in a good while.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ha∣bits.</NOTE> The Rusticks of <HI>Lithuania, Samogitia,</HI> &amp;c. wear generally a coarse ash-colour'd Habit, insomuch that scarce one in a Hundred is to be seen otherwise cloath'd. For their Legs, they have a kind of Bark-Buskins, as I have observ'd before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carriages, and how made.</NOTE> These Peasants have a Sort of Chariots or VVaggons, all of VVood, and very light, which they make by raddling or interweav∣ing Boughs with one another. They have commonly a Covering of the same Fashion, but the VVheels of this Machine are of one flat and entire Piece of VVood turn'd round. In a VVord, they are not much unlike our Colliers or Lime-burners Carts, that may be frequently seen in the Country. VVhen any Number of these Chariots are going together, they make an intolerable squeaking Noise, by reason that their Axel Trees are never greas'd. These Sort of Chariots are much in Use also among the <HI>Russians,</HI> as may be learnt from the Poet.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> The Houses these Peasants inhabit in, are built round, and thence call'd by them, <HI>Tow∣ers.</HI> They are narrow and open at Top that the Smoak and Stink might go out, and they are generally cover'd with Boards, Straw, or Bark of Trees. Here Men, with their Families and Cattle, live together; by which means it often happens that both are alternatively mischiev'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Employ∣ments within and without Doors.</NOTE> The Employments these People busie themselves in are various, whereof one be∣longing to the Men in VVinter, is to help to stuff Feather beds made of chop'd Feathers, and Stalks that grow in the Marshes. These Beds must needs make the most drowzy not a little vigilant. Part of the VVomens Business within Doors, is to weave Coarse Cloath. Both their Employments without, belongs either to Husbandry or Houswifry, as in other Countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why little Horses, here.</NOTE> <HI>The Reason why they have generally little Horses,</HI> Guagnini <HI>thinks is because of the ex∣cessive Cold that reigns there,</HI> yet, <HI>says he,</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="121"/>
they are not a little strong, for one of them carry'd me above a hundred and twenty Polish Miles in four Days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualifica∣tions for Marriage.</NOTE> Among these People, a Maid never marries till she is twenty four or thirty Years of Age, when she must also have wrought with her own Hands several Baskets full of Cloaths of different Kinds, which at the Time of her Espousals, she is to distribute among the Guests that her Husband brings along with him: She likewise must have serv'd her Mo∣ther in all Domestick Affairs for a certain Time. The same Rule holds in Respect of a Son. Another Observation may not be omitted, that those who are employ'd to make the Match, always enquire more strictly into the Manners and Behaviour of the Persons, than after the Cattel and Corn that they enjoy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of these Rusticks.</NOTE> The Character of these People is, that they are good natur'd, honest, and exceed∣ing chaste, for rarely any Quarrels, Robbe∣ries, Rapes, or Incests are to be met with among them. The young VVenches are so extreamly reserv'd, that they will draw a Knife at a Man that but offers to kiss them: And besides, their Mothers have a very watchful Eye over them, for they make them wear little Bells before and behind, to give them Notice where they are, and what they are doing.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="121"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Samogitia differs from <HI>Lithuania.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Samogitian</HI> Peasants differ but little from the <HI>Lithuanian,</HI> however some Peculiars there are to be observ'd.</P>
<P>First, The Rusticks of <HI>Samogitia</HI> are not so laborious as those of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and conse∣quently have not that Plenty of Provisi∣ons, &amp;c. therefore instead of Bread, they are accustom'd to eat a Sort of great Turnips as big as ones Head, which grow of them∣selves without sowing.</P>
<P>Next, They have a peculiar way of mak∣ing Mead, Metheglin, and Beer; for they are want to quench several red-hot Stones in it successively, after it has been boyl'd a whole Night, to make their Bellies soluble. This Drink they put into Vessels made of Bark of Trees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sturdy Drinkers rewarded.</NOTE> Thirdly, They have a Custom of reward∣ing a sturdy Drinker, by presenting him with a Shirt, Frock, Handkercheif, and the like.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They live to a greater Age than ordinary in <HI>Samogitia,</HI> for it is no wonder to see a Person of a hundred, or a hundred and twenty Years old there, which may be part∣ly manifested by a Passage which happen'd while a Monk was preaching about the Crea∣tion of the VVorld, at the Time of <HI>Jagel∣lo</HI>'s Expedition to convert hsi Countrey∣men.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="122"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of great Age.</NOTE> This Man is a notorious Lyar <HI>(said one of the Pagans, addressing himself to the King, and interrupting the Monk)</HI> I, and many more among us, have liv'd for above these hun∣dred Years, and yet never remember any such thing as he speaks of, for even from the Time that we were Boys, the same Seasons and Vicissitudes have continu'd: <HI>To which the King mildly re∣ply'd.</HI> Father, you say true, neither has the Priest affirm'd an Ʋntruth, for these things he speaks of, happen'd many Hundred Years ago, long before your Time, when the World was as∣suredly made out of nothing by a divine Ordinati∣on and Power. <HI>I conceive, My Lord, this may as well serve for an Argument of their Ignorance as of their Longevity.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">People more robust here.</NOTE> Fifthly, Their Character differs some∣thing from the <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> for they are, ge∣nerally speaking, more robust, bold, and nimble, and the Defence and Arms they use, are for the most part a Coat of Mail and a Hunter's Javelin.</P>
<P>Sixthly, No Part of <HI>Poland</HI> produces so much Honey, for here almost every Tree contains a Swarm of Bees. It is observable also, that the Honey of this Country is more free from Wax than elsewhere.</P>
<P>I shall now entertain your Lordship with a few remarkable Customs in Husbandry pe∣culiar to these two Countries, and wherein I will be as brief as I am sensible that Art is not much either known or esteem'd, being ap∣propriated
<PB N="233" REF="122"/>
chiefly to vulgar Conditi∣ons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners in Husbandry.</NOTE> It may be observ'd, that these People plow, sow, and harrow, all at the same Time, and that their Ground having been but once fecundated with burning, will bear great Crops seven or eight Years together without dunging. When they burn the Woods on the Lands, if they meet with high Trees, they do not cut them down, but only prune off their side Branches, so that the Sun may not be kept from the Ground, the manner of doing which is uncommon, for one Peasant will prune above a thousand Trees together without so much as once coming down.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange way of Pruning Trees.</NOTE> To effect this, he provides himself of a Seat of Rope, much like a Stirrup, the which he fastens to a long Cord, and having cast it over an Arm of the Tree, a Boy that is on the Ground draws him up and down, and when he has so done, by Help of another Cord, easily transfers him to the next Tree. This Peasant has always a Hook by his Side, with which he uses to lop off the Branch∣es.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peculiar manner of Sowing.</NOTE> They have moreover another odd and pe∣culiar Way of sowing in these Countries, which is by mixing two Parts of Barley with one of VVheat, and putting them into the Ground together in the Spring, whereby it happens, that the Barley may be mow'd on
<PB N="234" REF="123"/>
one Harvest, and the VVheat reap'd the next. This VVheat being trod down by those that mow the Barley, the next Harvest commonly comes up so thick and high, that there is scarce any passing thro' it for Fear of being stifled.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways of or∣dering Corn.</NOTE> In Time of VVar these Boors have a VVay of securing their Corn, &amp;c. by burying it in a Place made up under Ground with Posts and Bark of Trees for that Purpose. Their Way of ordering their Corn is also extraordinary, for they first dry it with Smoak before they lay it up in their Graneries, by which means it will keep good for several Years toge∣ther.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peculiar Customs in <HI>Prusia.</HI></NOTE> As for the <HI>Prussians,</HI> both Gentry and Commonalty, they may likewise be consi∣der'd by themselves in some Respects, for the former are not altogether so gaudy in their Habits, as the more Southern Parts of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the latter differ something from the <HI>Polish</HI> Peasants in their Habits, wear∣ing sometimes long strait Coats of Lea∣ther.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habitati∣ons and Furniture.</NOTE> Formerly the <HI>Prussians</HI> dwelt in Waggons or in Huts made of Boughs twisted together, and at this Day the Commonalty are not much improv'd in Architecture, for they ge∣nerally live in Hovels built with Stakes, and raddled with Rods, having either Earth or Fern for their Covering: Neither is there
<PB N="235" REF="123"/>
any great Improvement in their Furniture, for the old <HI>Prussian</HI> slept on the Ground, or on Skins of Beasts, and these lye upon the Straw.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meat and Drink.</NOTE> They are naturally content with spare Diet, and addicted more to Sloath than Gluttony: Yet, like the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Li∣thuanians,</HI> no ordinary Dose of Drink suf∣fices them, especially at Feasts, where they will frequently get very Drunk. Heretofore their Drink was Water or Mares Milk, mix'd sometimes with Blood, and now for the most part it is Mead or Beer. Their Ordinary Food is Fish, and they never knew the Use of Roots be∣fore the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order came amongst them, tho' now among the Peasants it is the Chief of their Dainties. I speak most of this of the Peasants of <HI>Prussi∣a,</HI> for the Gentry generally agree in their Customs and Manners with the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>These, My <HI>LORD,</HI> are all the Particulars I could possibly meet with, relating to the several Subjects propos'd to be addrest to your <HI>Lordship,</HI> and which I must humbly acknowledge I have hastily put together, without that due Order and Method which I ought to have done: Yet, in Regard, my Helps were not a little confus'd, I hope your <HI>Lordship</HI> will be pleas'd to pardon the ill Performance, as well as the Presumption

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR constant Fatigues and vast Ex∣pences during the late bloody War, discover both an undoubted Zeal to serve your Country, and a Natural Inclination, like that of your Noble Ancestors to Warlike Atchive∣ments. Wherefore, being to treat of the Military Affairs in <HI>Poland,</HI> I thought no Per∣son more proper to address my Account to than your <HI>GRACE,</HI> tho' I were well assured at the same time, that it is most impossible to give you any tolerable satisfaction therein, unless I my self had more Experience in those Matters, or the <HI>Poles</HI> had a better Discipline in their Army. But since they must own their Defect in the one, as I do ingenuously confess my Ignorance in the other, I hope your <HI>Grace</HI> will be pleased to accept this Letter, rather as a Proof of my endeavours to entertain your Leisure, than of any Presumption I had to lay down any thing which might in the least con∣tribute or add to the Knowlege of a General Officer of your Experience.</P>

This is what they call their <HI>Pospolite Ruszenie,</HI> or the whole Body of <HI>Militia</HI> of the Kingdom gathered together under one Head or General, at a place and time appoin∣ted by the King, and those of the Senate that are always to attend him as his Privy-Council.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who in the Foot, and Penalty for neglect in both.</NOTE> All these are to be Horse, well accoutred, but as an Army cannot be compleat without some Foot, this <HI>Pospolite</HI> also did consist for∣merly of the 20th Boor out of every Village, or rather Farm, who was to be arm'd with a Scymitar, long Gun, and Pole-Ax, but which is often now chang'd to a Mulct to hire For∣reigners: Yet there are still some <HI>Polish</HI> Foot, tho' of small Esteem. Every Citizen that is now worth 8000 <HI>Florens,</HI> is to find a Horse, and he that has only 4000 is to set out a Foot-Sol∣dier well provided. The Boors also are to fit out one among 28 Families, and to furnish him with Provisions sufficient for half a Year. The <HI>Poles</HI> term both these <HI>Wybrancy's,</HI> that is, <HI>Pick'd</HI> or <HI>Selected</HI> Men, so that <HI>Wybraniecka Piechota</HI> is a <HI>Pick'd Soldier.</HI> If any of all these refuse to appear upon the third Summons, their Lands or Goods are immediately confis∣cated to the King's Use.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are excused from serv∣ing.</NOTE> Those Gentry that are excus'd from appear∣ing at the <HI>Pospolite,</HI> are, 1. Such as may de∣pute others in their Room, <HI>viz.</HI> Superannua∣ted or Sick Persons, Widows, Orphans, Mi∣nors, and lastly the Clergy for their Tempo∣ralities. When any Publick or Private No∣bleman is Sick, he must notisie and attest it by the Oaths of several sufficient Witnesses. Also it must be observ'd, that in <HI>Lithuania</HI> a Clergy man must send out both for his Spiri∣tual and Temporal Estate, as likewise in <HI>Po∣land,</HI> where there are any Temporal Lands an∣nex'd to his Benefice. 2. Those that have E∣states in several <HI>Palatinates</HI> or <HI>Districts,</HI> are o∣blig'd but to appear for one. 3. The poorer
<PB N="4" REF="127"/>
sort of Gentry are eas'd in some measure, for several of them may joyn in the fitting out of one Horse, which is practised especially in <HI>Masovia.</HI> Also Brothers that are Joint-Te∣nants may Depute one to appear for all. 4. The King's Court and Retinue▪are not obliged to Muster under the <HI>Palatins,</HI> and where the King does not go into the Field in Person, they are to be totally excus'd. 5. About 30 of the Gentry of the Queen's Court are ex∣empt. 6. About 12 of the Archbishop of <HI>Gnesna</HI>'s Court, and oftentimes some Officers of the Bishop of <HI>Cracow,</HI> and other Bishops Courts, especially where their Attendance is otherwise requir'd by the Republick. 7. All Ministers to Foreign Courts, together with their Domesticks, are absolutely to be dispen∣sed with. 8.

<P>Several Provinces and <HI>Palatinates</HI> likewise, have peculiar Privileges relating to this gene∣ral Meeting, for in the Palatinates of <HI>Masovia</HI> and <HI>Plockzko,</HI> six Brothers, altho' they have distinct Estates, send but one Horse-man. In <HI>Podlachia,</HI> out of ten Farms they send but one Light-Horse, and out of twenty but one <HI>Cui∣rassier.</HI> The <HI>Palatinates</HI> of <HI>Kiovia</HI> and <HI>Brac∣law,</HI> have likewise peculiar Privileges. In a general Expedition, the Gentry of <HI>Podolia</HI> were to continue in Garrison at <HI>Caminiec,</HI> while the <HI>Poles</HI> had that City in possession. The <HI>Prussians</HI> also need not march beyond the Ri∣ver <HI>Vistula, Ossa,</HI> and <HI>Drebnicz.</HI> And lastly,
<PB N="5" REF="127"/>
<HI>Lithuanians</HI> are not to go beyond the bounds of their Great Dutchy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great numbers of the <HI>Pospo∣life</HI> former∣ly, and now.</NOTE> As to the great number assembled at this <HI>Pospolite, Basko,</HI> a <HI>Polish</HI> Writer says, that only in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Lenschet,</HI> in the time of <HI>Boleslaus Chrobry,</HI> 2000 <HI>Cuirassiers,</HI> and 4000 Light-Horse were raised at one time. <HI>Staro∣volscius</HI> says, that <HI>Uladislaus</HI> had 100000 Horse against the <HI>Prussian</HI> Knights, over and above what he had left to defend the Provinces. I might observe several other prodigious Lu∣strations out of the aforesaid Author, but for brevity sake I omit them; only I may affirm with <HI>Boterus,</HI> in his Description of <HI>Poland,</HI> that in case of necessity the <HI>Poles</HI> can raise up∣wards of 100000 Horse, and the <HI>Lithuanians</HI> 70000: But <HI>Starovolscius</HI> is of Opinion, they can both raise above 200000 Horse without Expense. Also <HI>Fredro</HI> thinks, that the <HI>Poles</HI> can raise above 200000 Horse.</P>
<P>The number of <HI>Polish</HI> Foot is uncertain, they being at Liberty to appear, or to be excu∣sed for Money. <HI>Starovolscius</HI> says, that in his time they did not amount to many hundreds, being discouraged by the rigour of their <HI>Sta∣rosta</HI>'s, and wholly confin'd to their rustick Drudgery, tho' (continues he) they are more able to sustain the hardships of War, then ei∣ther the <HI>Germans</HI> or <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who can scarce live in the <HI>Polish</HI> Air. He also is of O∣pinion, that the <HI>Polish</HI> Infantry, if encourag∣ed, might amount to a considerable number, and be not a little serviceable. The Foreign hir'd Foot have sometimes exceeded 30000, when the <HI>Cosacks</HI> serv'd the <HI>Poles,</HI> but they
<PB N="6" REF="128"/>
fought also on Horseback, and King <HI>Stephen</HI> in his Expedition against the <HI>Suedes</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> had above 16000 <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Foot in his Pay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ner of their being Rais∣ed and Mu∣stered.</NOTE> Now I shall proceed to present your <HI>Grace</HI> with an account of the manner of raising and Mustering this vast Body of Men. When a <HI>Pospolite</HI> is once agreed by the General <HI>Diet</HI> to be summon'd, the King, after the Anci∣ent manner, sends out his Writs, or Letters into all the <HI>Palatinates</HI> or <HI>Districts</HI> of his King∣dom, which being received by the inferiour Officers, they are fastned by a small Cord to a long Pole (whence they are called <HI>Literae Re∣stium</HI> by some, and by others <HI>VVici,</HI> signify∣ing in <HI>Polish,</HI> a Staff) and carried alost to every one of the Chief Noblemen of the <HI>District</HI> thrice in a Month, and Proclaim'd as often in all Cities and Towns. All Courts of Justice cease at the third reading of these Letters, un∣less it be those of the Vice-<HI>Starosta</HI>'s, who exercise their Jurisdiction as before. After the last reading of these Letters, a Place is ap∣pointed by several private Assemblies of the Nobility in every <HI>District,</HI> for particular Mu∣sters, and afterwards for the General Muster of every <HI>Palatinate.</HI> Here the <HI>Palatins</HI> and <HI>Castellans</HI> take an exact Account of the Men, Horses, Arms, &amp;c. neither of which can be chang'd after that Muster. At the same time also, the <HI>Palatin</HI> divides the <HI>Districts</HI> among the several <HI>Castellans,</HI> and orders them their several Posts. In those <HI>Palatinates</HI> where there is but one <HI>Castellan,</HI> there part of his Duty is performed by a Vice-Chamberlain, &amp;c. and
<PB N="7" REF="128"/>
in <HI>Lithuania</HI> by a Marshal of every <HI>District.</HI> This particular Muster being over, the <HI>Castel∣lan</HI> of every <HI>District</HI> leads the Gentry under▪ his Command to the place of general Muster for the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> where the <HI>Palatin</HI> Musters them again, and takes an account of the De∣faulters. Before the <HI>Castellans</HI> come to the <HI>Palatins,</HI> Justice is absolutely in their Hands, but afterwards they must resign it to the <HI>Pala∣tin,</HI> tho' Capital Crimes are always reserved for the determination of the General, or ra∣ther of the King, who of late days has had a Council of War Assign'd him for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>I may here observe, that the Gentry are always Muster'd and Registr'd annually by their respective Officers. <HI>Starovolscius</HI> reasona∣bly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Things re∣quired in vain of the <HI>Polish</HI> Ca∣valry.</NOTE>requires two necessary Qualities in the <HI>Po∣lish</HI> Horse, which they seldom or never have, and those are <HI>Expedition</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> As to the former, he says, they are always unwilling to leave their Wives and Children, and there∣fore never care for appearing, before they are forced by the third Summons: And as for the latter, when they are got together, he says, thinking themselves Powerful, they are al∣ways Plotting, and ready to Rebel against their Superiours; and the reason is, that altho' the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> abounds with all manner of Plenty, yet in every Expedition almost, the Soldiers are ready to starve, which is occasio∣ned by a shameful neglect of the Chief Offi∣cers to furnish the Army with requisite Pro∣visions, whence it often comes to pass, that tho' matters are brought to the nearest issue, yet they are generally forsaken before they are
<PB N="8" REF="129"/>
accomplished, the Soldiers Heads running af∣ter nothing but Forrage and Plunder, which they take wherever it comes in their way, whereby the Country is generally injur'd in∣stead of being righted and defended. There are other Causes of this Confusion and Dis∣order in the Army, which I shall speak of hereafter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meet at the General Rendezvous</NOTE> When the Gentry have been thus Muster'd by the <HI>Palatins,</HI> they are next to be led by their Officers to the Place of general Rendezvous, where every <HI>Palatin</HI> delivers up his Charge to the Supremacy of the Great General. In their March they are not to be quarter'd upon any of the King's or Gentrys Estates, but are to encamp in the open Fields, that they may make no disturbance in the Citys. At this day the Generals Power is very much limit∣ed in respect of what it was formerly, for then a General was altogether Absolute, and his Will alone went for a Law, but now he can do little without the consent of such as the Republick has Assign'd him. Besides the Great Generals, and Field-Marshals, the King, by the Laws, is obliged to be in the Ar∣my in Person. This appears by the example of King <HI>Alexander,</HI> who, by reason the Gen∣try demanded his Presence among them, tho' Sick, was forced to be carried in a Litter into the Camp. This was thought to have been Plotted by the Contrivance of the Duke of <HI>Glinski,</HI> who hoped thereby that the King would catch his Death.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="129"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Division of the Ar∣my, and first of the Horse.</NOTE> Before I proceed any farther, I ought to give your <HI>GRACE</HI> a Division of the <HI>Polish</HI> Army, and therein observe, that it is compos∣ed of different kinds of Soldiers, as first of the <HI>Pospolite,</HI> or Militia. 2. Of hir'd Soldiers. 3. Of Auxiliaries. 4. Of Quartarian Hirelings. And 5th of Voluntiers. And again, it con∣sists both of Horse and Foot, and those Na∣tives and Foreigners; the Natives are for the greatest part Horse, or Cavalry, and may be divided into four sorts, which may also be con∣sidered in two manners, as first heavy-Arm'd, and secondly light-Horse. The former are, 1. The <HI>Hussartz,</HI> which, with their Horses, are both in close Armour. And 2 the <HI>Tovarzysz,</HI> which have only a Breast-Plate, Helmet, and Gorget. These are both choice Men, and the latter are so named from a word in <HI>Polish</HI> which signifies <HI>Companion.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heavy Ar¦med.</NOTE> The first of these are Armed with short Lances, Sabres, and Pistols, and the second, with Carabines, Bows, and Arrows, &amp;c. These short Lances are called by the <HI>Poles, Kopye,</HI> whence also the Body of Men that uses them is term'd <HI>Kopiynick.</HI> These <HI>Kopiie</HI> are about 6 Foot long, and tied to the Horsmen's Wrists with strings of Silk. When they come near their Enemy, they dart their Lances with all their Force against them, and if they miss their Bodies, they suddenly snatch back the Lance, by help of the Silken string, but where they have mortally wounded any, then they slip the Silk, and leave the Lance in their Bo∣dies, till such time as they can ride up to them to cut of their Heads with a broad well tem∣per'd Sabre, which always hangs by their Sad∣dles.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="130"/>
Both the <HI>Hussartz</HI> and <HI>Tovarzysz,</HI> with their Horses, look frightfully, being stuck all over with Wings of Storks, Cranes, Turky-Cocks, &amp;c. and Cloath'd over their Armour with skins of Leopards, Tygres, Bears, Lyons, &amp;c. all which they do to make themselves the more terrible to their Enemy. These Cavalry for the most part set themselves also off wilh va∣rious Partycolour'd Mantles, which oftentimes shine with Jewels, Gold and Silver. Of the <HI>Hussartz</HI> there are but 5 Companies in <HI>Poland,</HI> every Company consisting of about 300 Men, all Arm'd <HI>Cap-a-pe.</HI> They have but one Lieutenant in each Company, which they call <HI>Poruczknik,</HI> and one <HI>Korazy,</HI> or Trumpeter, with a particular sort of Trum∣pet, which they call <HI>Koronzy.</HI> One of these the present King of <HI>France</HI> caus'd to be brought into his Kingdom, with design to have the like made, but being extreamly costly, and not like to be of any great use among the Can∣non, he laid his Intention aside.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Light Horse.</NOTE> The Light Horse are also of two sorts, and are either with Armour, or without. The first sort wear Coats of Mail, and differ in Names as they do in Countries. The <HI>Poles</HI> call them <HI>Pancerznicy Koragwy,</HI> and the <HI>Lithu∣anians, Petihorsky Koragwy,</HI> which last differ something in their Dress from the former. The number of these far exceeds that either of the <HI>Hussartz,</HI> or <HI>Tovarzysz.</HI> They are both separate Companies, and are Incorporated in∣to no Regiments. They are in all about 6 or 7000, and are Arm'd with Darts and Sabres, and, if they please, they may wear Wings and Feathers. Those out of Armour which
<PB N="11" REF="130"/>
are the fourth sort of Horse, wear a <HI>Burka,</HI> or rough Mantle about their Necks, and have for Arms a Bow and Arrows, with a Sabre. These are the most numerous of all, and com∣pose the main Body of the Army, call d by the <HI>Poles, Woysko.</HI> The number of these is al∣ways determin'd by the <HI>Diet.</HI> Neither these nor the others ever wear Liveries, as in most Countries, because they are all <HI>Polish</HI> Gentle∣men. These, were they better Disciplin'd, and better paid, would, perhaps, be the finest Cavalry in the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Division of the Foot.</NOTE> As for the Foot, they are either <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> or Foreigners, levy'd chiefly in <HI>Ger∣many</HI> and <HI>Hungary.</HI> The <HI>Zaporohensian Cosacks</HI> for∣merly serv'd the <HI>Poles</HI> as Volunteers, for very small Pay. They sometimes came in 30000 strong, Arm'd with hook'd Lances, Scymitars, and long Guns, and each having his Horse, they fought either Mounted or on Foot. They us'd their own Discipline, and chose all their Commanders out of their own Body, and would frequently depose even their Gene∣ral without any reason if he were not success∣ful.</P>
<P>I have observ'd some of the Manners of these <HI>Cosacks</HI> in the first Volume of this History, and here it may not be a-miss, by way of Di∣gression, to say something more of them, e∣specially in what relates to War, wherein I shall be as brief as I ought in reason.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A further account of the <HI>Co∣sacks.</HI></NOTE> They had their Name of <HI>Zaporohensian</HI> from the <HI>Russians,</HI> calling them <HI>Porohi,</HI> import∣ing that they liv'd beyond the borders of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland.</HI> He that Governs them
<PB N="12" REF="131"/>
at present is their General, who, instead of a Scepter, bears only a Commander's Staff made of Cane. As this Person is not Elected by Votes, but by tumultuary Acclamations, and throwing up of Caps, so he is frequently de∣posed after the same manner, by the incon∣stant Suffrages of the <HI>Populace;</HI> but however, while he injoys his Supremacy, he has an Ar∣bitrary Power over Life and Death. Next to him are the 4 Counsellors of War (called by them <HI>Assavuli)</HI> and the Lieutenant-Gene∣ral: After these are the several Prefects, and other Sub-Commanders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings in their Coun∣sells of War</NOTE> In their Counsels of War, the General ha∣ving caus'd all the People to be Conven'd, and standing under a Canopy bare headed, toge∣ther with the Counsellors, and Lieutenant-General, after making a small Reverence to the Multitude, who are sitting all the while, proposes to them what is fit to be debated at that Session; then is also his time to clear any Accusations made against him, or to request any Favour of the Publick, which he always does with a great deal of Submission and Re∣spect. While the General is speaking, the People all hearken with profound silence, but as soon as he has done, they pronounce their Pleasure with no less Noise and Vocifieration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of for∣tifying their Camps and Boats.</NOTE> By Land, like the Ancient <HI>Gauls,</HI> they for∣tify their Camps with their Carriages, and at Sea they are wont to defend their little Boats against the Fury of Tempests, by fencing them all round, and over head, with Reeds radled together, not unlike our Arbors. Of these <HI>Cosacks, Amurath</HI> the Great, Emperor of <HI>Tur∣key</HI> us'd to say, <HI>That in spite of the other Poten∣tates</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="131"/>
<HI>of</HI> Europe, <HI>he could sleep on both Ears</HI> (a <HI>Turkish</HI> Expression) <HI>but that these Gad-flies would scarce suffer him to sleep on either.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pow∣er.</NOTE> We may guess at the Power of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> by observing, that at one time they had above 200000 Men in the Field, in their Rebellion a∣gainst <HI>Poland,</HI> but then indeed they had assist∣ance from the <HI>Russians,</HI> who Rebell'd likewise. At present they have pretty good intelligence with the <HI>Poles,</HI> being very uneasy under the <HI>Turkish</HI> and <HI>Muscovitish</HI> Yoke, and they did the late King <HI>John Sobieski</HI> no small service in his Wars against the former.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the <HI>Polish</HI> Foot are, and how employ∣ed.</NOTE> To return to the <HI>Polish</HI> Foot, as I said before, they are either Natives or Foreigners. How the Natives are raised I shewed before. They are generally nothing but the vilest Mob, and their business is rather to serve as Pioneers than Soldiers, for the Gentry only make use of them to dig and fill up Trenches and Ditches, to undermine Walls, build Bridges, clear the Roads, to load and drive the Carriages, to keep Guard in the Camp, while the other Sol∣diers are absent, and, in a word, to do all manner of drudgery they shall be command∣ed to.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hired Foot, and their Condition.</NOTE> These are mixt for the most part with the <HI>German</HI> hir'd Foot, who do not meet with much better treatment in the Army. <HI>VVhen we design to Besiege any Place,</HI> (says <HI>Starovolsci∣us) we commonly send into</HI> Germany <HI>or</HI> Hun∣gary <HI>to hire Foot, they being more Expert and Expeditious at any such work than ours.</HI> Among these, the word of Command is generally gi∣ven in the <HI>German</HI> Tongue. They are all di∣vided
<PB N="14" REF="132"/>
into Regiments and Companies as in other Countries, and Commanded as well by <HI>Polish</HI> as <HI>German</HI> Officers. The Soldiers are generally so ill provided for, that most of them have neither Swords nor Shooes, and when they are in Winter-Quarters, they have not above a Penny a day allowed them, be∣sides what they can steal. Neither are their Officers much more kindly dealt with, for they scarce fare so well in any respect, as our common Sentinels do here.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why so much used, and their Arms and Liveries.</NOTE> Altho' there is a set number of <HI>Polish</HI> Foot that are Natives, allowed out of every Vil∣lage and Town, and which consequently is part of the <HI>Pospolite;</HI> yet because these Gene∣ral Expeditions are very slow in getting toge∣ther, and so instead of relieveing their Coun∣try, rather oppress and expose it to Danger, the <HI>Poles</HI> have always almost, made use of Fo∣reign Soldiers upon sudden Occasions, which would the easier be made subject to Discipline, and fit to undergo any Hazard or Exploit. The Arms of all these Foot are chiefly a long hook'd Battle-Ax, and which the <HI>Poles</HI> call in their Language, <HI>Bardysz,</HI> but sometimes they have a sort of long Guns. When the <HI>Cosacks</HI> and <HI>Heydukes</HI> serve the <HI>Poles,</HI> the latter have Liveries given them of one Colour, and the former have a sort of course Cloth of what Colour they please. They both have Horses to use upon occasion. What other Foreign Horse or Foot there are, I shall give your <HI>Grace</HI> an Account of in their proper places, but at present, for Method's sake, I must go back to the <HI>Pospolite.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="132"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentry how far obliged to March; with other particulars.</NOTE> The Gentry are not obliged to go beyond the Frontiers above five Miles, nor to continue above six Weeks in the Field, and if they are compell'd by a unanimous Agreement of the <HI>Diet,</HI> (which never happens but upon ve∣ry extraordinary Occasions) then either the King or State is to bear their Charges, and make good their Damages. When the Gen∣try take any Prisoners they are to present them to the King, and he is to make them some return by Custom, but when they are taken themselves they are to be ransom'd out of the Publick Treasury. For Foreign Expe∣ditions the <HI>Poles</HI> make use of Stipendiary Sol∣diers, provided the Enemy be not extraordi∣nary strong; for in such case, the Nobility, by a decree of the <HI>Diet,</HI> is to march against them: So the <HI>Turk</HI> once coming towards <HI>Po∣land</HI> with 600000 Men, the King did not care to trust even to 70000 hir'd Foreigners, but convok'd the Gentry together at <HI>Leopol,</HI> with whom, if he had set forward as speedily as he was advised, he might have totally extirpated the Infidels, for ought I know, out of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> The Gentry are oblig'd to be in Arms as long as the King or State has occasion for them. They all serve on Horseback, not only for Honours sake, but likewise, that they may the more speedily intercept and oppose the E∣nemy before they reach their Frontiers. When the Wars are over, the Nobility are not <HI>ipso fa∣cto</HI> Discharged, but must wait till they are me∣thodically dismiss'd the Roll or Register by the <HI>Palatins,</HI> the reason of which is, for fear they might otherwise misuse the Citizens and Boors in a tumultuous Return.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="133"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hungari∣an</HI> Foot when first hired.</NOTE> Of the hir'd Soldiers I have spoken some∣thing before: All that I think proper to add is, that the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Foot which the <HI>Poles</HI> call <HI>VVegerska Piechota,</HI> were first instituted by <HI>Stephen Batori,</HI> in his Wars against the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI> to the maintaining of which, almost e∣very <HI>Diet</HI> contributes something, yet which seldom or never suffices them. Formerly the hir'd Foot consisted as well of Natives as Stran∣gers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Auxilia∣ries, <HI>what?</HI></NOTE> The Auxiliary differ from the hir'd Forces, in regard that the former are such as have been agreed to be furnished the <HI>Poles</HI> by Foreign Princes in a Treaty of Peace; and the latter are such as have been levied in other Coun∣tries by permission.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Example.</NOTE> Of this first sort were a certain number al∣lowed <HI>Boleslaus Crivoustus</HI> by the <HI>Russians,</HI> and to <HI>Casimir</HI> IV. by the <HI>Tartars</HI> against the <HI>Prus∣sias,</HI> which were to have some Rewards from the <HI>Poles:</HI> These Rewards the <HI>Tartars</HI> after∣wards requir'd yearly as a Tribute, nay, tho' they did no manner of Service for them; whereupon King <HI>Stephen</HI> repell'd their Impor∣tunacies with an absolute Refusal, as I have observ'd before in that King's Life, which oc∣casion'd great heats and disturbances, but at length a Peace was concluded between these two Nations, under the Reign of <HI>John Casi∣mir,</HI> whereby the <HI>Poles</HI> were oblig'd to pay a certain Stipend to the <HI>Cham;</HI> and on the o∣ther hand, the <HI>Cham</HI> was to be assisting to the <HI>Poles</HI> whenever they had occasion, but it is certain that the latter broke his promise, which induced a non-performance in the former. There are other Examples of these kinds of
<PB N="17" REF="133"/>
Soldiers, and at present some Allies are still obliged by such Contracts. These Soldiers are both Horse and Foot, as the Agreement is made.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quarta∣rians</HI> what, and whence so called▪</NOTE> This breach of Alliance by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> occasion'd the <HI>Poles</HI> a new sort of Soldiers; for <HI>Sigismundus Augustus,</HI> to prevent their In∣cursions into his Kingdom, allotted a fourth part of his Crown-Revenues, to maintain a Guard on the Frontiers towards <HI>Tartary.</HI> This fourth part was sometimes augmented, and that as often as Exigencys required. It was to be supervised by two <HI>Senators,</HI> and two of the Gentry, in conjunction with the High-Trea∣surer of <HI>Poland.</HI> The <HI>Starosta</HI> of <HI>Rava</HI> had the Custody of it, and was to give in his year∣ly Accounts how he had distributed it.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Volun∣teers <HI>what in</HI> Poland.</NOTE> Besides all these Soldiers before-mentioned, some of the richest Gentry in <HI>Poland</HI> have all along been accustom'd, at their sole costs and charges, to raise several Troops of Horse for the publick Service; some few Examples of the Power of which it may not be amiss to insert. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Examples.</NOTE>By the help of these, <HI>Zamoski,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Sigismund</HI> III. worsted <HI>Carambeius</HI> the <HI>Scythian,</HI> with 3000 Men only, who with 70000 came to Invade <HI>Poland,</HI> but with the loss of

Also in the late Reign, <HI>Andrew Trzebicki</HI> (who afterwards was made Primate) when but Bishop of <HI>Cra∣cow,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Severia,</HI> rais'd a conside∣rable number of Forces at his own proper Ex∣pence, to be sent against the <HI>Turks,</HI> and which performed Wonders under the then General <HI>John Sobieski.</HI> I omit many others that have done the same thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Selected out of the Gen∣try.</NOTE> These Soldiers have been for the most part selected out of the Nobility, which has been the occasion of their so frequent success in but small numbers, in respect to those of their Enemies. From this voluntary raising of these Soldiers, they have had the Name given them of <HI>Volunteers,</HI> tho' in other Countries, that Title is appropriated to such as serve of their own Accord, and without Pay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes that weaken the <HI>Polish</HI> Force.</NOTE> Notwithstanding the great number and Warlike Disposition of all these several kinds of Soldiers, yet their Power is very much a∣bated by their want of Discipline, and the neglect of the State, and their Officers, in the due administration of Affairs; for first, as to the <HI>State,</HI> the <HI>Diet</HI> consisting of so many Per∣sons of differing Sentiments, is so exceeding tardy in fitting matters for Action, that like a Clock made up of many contrary Motions, its Progress must consequently be very slow; and likewise, before the <HI>Senators</HI> and Gentry
<PB N="19" REF="134"/>
can meet together, there are so many Cere∣monies to be past, (which they scarce ever abridge in the greatest Extremities) that a Po∣tent Enemy may over-run the Kingdom, be∣fore the <HI>Pospolite</HI> can well be got ready to op∣pose them. This was experienced when the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> took <HI>Polocz</HI> and <HI>Smolensko</HI> from <HI>Sigismundus Augustus,</HI> who by reason of the disagreements at that time in the <HI>Diet,</HI> was never afterwards able to revenge it. The same <HI>Czar</HI> likewise invaded <HI>Livonia</HI> without op∣position, thro' the like Defect, which he could never have effected with so good success, had the <HI>Poles</HI> been in a readiness to have marched against him; but they are generally so long in fitting out, and so unwilling to part with their beloved Luxury at the <HI>Diet,</HI> that they can∣not easily change to the rougher exercise of War.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Four things required to defend a State.</NOTE> <HI>Boterus,</HI> in his Description of <HI>Poland,</HI> says, that four things are indispensibly requisite to the Defence of a State; and they are, 1. Na∣tive Force. 2. Numerous. 3. Potent. And 4. Expeditious. First, their Force ought to be Native, that they may not be betray'd by trusting it in the Hands of Strangers, who have not so great Interest in the Success as themselves. Secondly, Numerous, that they may always be able to bring on fresh Supplies in cases of Extremity. Thirdly, Potent, be∣cause Numbers without Courage would rather contribute towards their Defeat than Victory: And fourthly, Expeditious and Active, that they may be qualified for hasty Marches, and to rally upon the greatest Rout. Now, tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> have a sort of Claim to the three
<PB N="20" REF="135"/>
former of these Qualities, yet they are a lit∣tle wanting in the latter, especially before they come into the Field, the causes of which may be the want of sufficient Authority in the Prince, or the slow and defective Supplies of Money, which has always been justly esteem'd the Sinews of War. The insufficiency of the Princes Power may appear all along in the reading of this History; and the defect in supplies of Money is apparent, by the bad Paying and Providing for the Army, for the Soldiers that are to receive Pay, are never paid above once in half a Year, and oftentimes not at all, but are forced to subsist upon Plun∣der, or upon what they can find in the Woods; nay, <HI>Hauteville</HI> says, they have sometimes been reduced to eat Horse-flesh. As for the Officers, they receive no Pay above once a Year, and sometimes but once in two.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of paying the Army.</NOTE> The manner of Paying them is particular, and therefore it may not be improper to pre∣sent your <HI>GRACE</HI> with an account of it. Commissioners deputed by the <HI>Diet</HI> for this purpose are ordered to meet at a place that is a good way off from Court, to the end the King may not concern himself in it, tho' every thing there be done in his Name. Then they proceed to allot every Officer his <HI>quota,</HI> but they commonly retrench part of their due, espe∣cially where they are Foreigners, and which may the better be tolerated, because the Officers are generally at no charge to subsist and recruit their Companies, and yet their Commission runs, as if they had taken care of them, so that however the Soldiers suffer, the Officers have no reason to complain.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="135"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ro∣kosz,</HI> and its manner of proceed∣ing.</NOTE> By the Armies being so seldom paid, and sometimes not at all for want of Money, the Soldiers frequently Confederate together and Mutiny, the manner whereof is commonly this. The Officers after they have found that their repeated complaints both to Court and the <HI>Diet,</HI> prove fruitless, are wont to As∣semble and make a <HI>Rokosz,</HI> which in the <HI>Po∣lish</HI> Language implys, <HI>a forsaking their Gene∣rals.</HI> The Subaltern Officers being thus Assem∣bled, Elect two among them, one for their <HI>Marshal,</HI> and another for their Lieutenant, which last they term their Substitute; both these they immediately make to Swear, <HI>That they will use their utmost endeavours to procure their Pay from the Republick.</HI> After this, the said <HI>Marshal</HI> forthwith takes upon him the Office of General; the sequel of which may be easily conjectur'd to be nothing but Ruin and Desolation; for then the Army instead of Marching against the Enemy or securing the Frontiers, minds nothing else but Plunder, Rapine and Destruction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Example.</NOTE> An Example of this kind happen'd under the Reign of <HI>John Casimir,</HI> when one <HI>Swi∣derski</HI> was Marshal, and one <HI>Borzecki,</HI> his Lieutenant or Substitute. This Confederacy which was not easily quell'd by the King, was thought to have been occasion'd more by the influence of some Male-contents, who hop'd to effect their Designs in such a Confusion, than for any great omission in paying the Army. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Other in∣convenien∣cies which suppress the <HI>Pole</HI>'s Power.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are other inconveniencies which in∣troduce Confusion and Disorder into the <HI>Po∣lish</HI> Army, and consequently Oppression of
<PB N="22" REF="136"/>
the people; and these flow chiefly from the Officers, and first from the General's being perpetual, the King being often oblig'd to give that great Charge to a rich Noble∣man, that knows little or nothing of War∣like matters, yet when he has once bestow'd it, he cannot recall his Grant, tho' he fore∣see never so many ill Consequences that at∣tend it; so that it is no wonder if <HI>Poland</HI> often makes false steps in Martial Affairs, when it has frequently so unexperienc'd a Guide. On the contrary, if this high Com∣mand were only conferr'd on, and conti∣nu'd to Merit, what wonders might not the <HI>Polish</HI> Cavalry be able to perform? for be∣ing so vast a number of Horse, they might easily hem in and Cut off the greatest Bo∣dy of Foot, of which the Armies of their Enemies chiefly Consist. Another inconve∣nience proceeds from the ill Conduct and Remissness of the under Officers, the grea∣test whereof is that, especially those of the Gentry, seldom come to the place of Ren∣dezvouz, till a Month or six Weeks after the time appointed, and this neither the King nor General dares offer to remedy, for fear of disobliging that serviceable Body. In like manner the Gentry are sometimes accu∣stom'd to leave the Army a Month before the Campaign is ended, which grievance is also not to be redress'd without danger. The cause of their being so tardy in appearing, is in a great measure to be Attributed to the defective Orders given them; for when the Officers are Commanded to March to such or such a place in the Kingdom, nei∣ther
<PB N="23" REF="136"/>
the time they are to march in, nor the Towns they are to pass through, are com∣prehended, so that by these means they are at liberty, to delay on account of their own private Business, as much as they please, or else, to wander all over the Kingdom, either for their Profit or Pleasure; whereby the Country they March through is not a little damag'd, and the best laid Designs of the Army frustrated by their Absence. Another Inconvenience arising from the Officers, is, That they employ so much Money in fitting themselves out with costly Arms, and splen∣did Equipage▪ that for want of timely Pay, they have seldom any thing left, in a little time, to support their Necessities: Which De∣fect they are wont to make up, by oppressing the People after an unreasonable manner. From this Extravagance of theirs, proceeds another Inconvenience to the State; For, af∣ter they have thus exhausted their Pockets, they usually lay the Occasion of their Mis∣behaviour either on the Court, or the Go∣vernment, which, in the succeeding <HI>Diet,</HI> of∣tentimes produces great Heats and Distur∣bances. When any new Levies are to be made in <HI>Poland,</HI> the Officers not only excuse, for Money, what Places they think sit; but also, as I observ'd before, seldom pay the Sol∣diers the Rates that they are allow'd for them; so that these latter are, in a manner, forc'd to pillage and plunder even their own Coun∣try, without their Officers being able to hin∣der them, by reason that they have first set them Examples for so doing.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Means pro∣pos'd to a∣void these Inconveni∣ences, but ever-ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d:</NOTE> To avoid most of these Inconveniences, some discerning Politicians have propos'd to the <HI>Diet,</HI> to keep the Soldiers always Encam∣ped, to the end that they might be made more subject to Discipline, by disabling them from pillaging the Country; and by keep∣ing them together, they might be always at hand to oppose the sudden Inroads of an Ene∣my. By these Means also, the People, being deliver'd from Oppression, would be the bet∣ter able to pay their Taxes; which would re∣move that fatal Inconvenience, of the Army's being ill paid. This Advice some approv'd of, and argu'd for: But others vigorously op∣pos'd it; alledging, that it might be of very ill Consequence to intrust so great a Power in the Hands of one Person, their General; and to confide it to more than one, would, pro∣bably, through Emulation, occasion no less Disorder and Danger to the Commonwealth.

In like manner,
<PB N="25" REF="137"/>
another General, <HI>Boratinius,</HI> with 2000 Horse, defeated 30000 <HI>Moscovites,</HI> killing 7000 of them, and bringing away all their Cannon. In the same Reign likewise, <HI>Camenecius,</HI> with only 6000 Horse, overthrew above 25000 <HI>Tartars.</HI> And about the same time, <HI>Tarno∣vius,</HI> with 4000, beat 22000 <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Va∣lachians,</HI> taking from them above 52 Field-Pieces. In <HI>Sigismund</HI> II's Reign, Duke <HI>Rad∣zivil,</HI> with 7000 only, routed 30000 <HI>Mosco∣vites,</HI> and took from them the Castle of <HI>Ula:</HI> And Prince <HI>Sapieba,</HI> with 5000, both defen∣ded the Fortress of <HI>Venda,</HI> and defeated the Besiegers, which were upwards of 24000 <HI>Moscovites</HI> and <HI>Livonians.</HI> Under King <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> General <HI>Zborowski,</HI> with scarce 2000 Horse, discomfited the whole Army of <HI>Dant∣zic</HI>-Rebels, made up out of several Nations, and left above 8000 dead upon the Spot. Also, in <HI>Sigismund</HI> III's Time, General <HI>Za∣moski,</HI> with scarce 6000 Horse, beat the Arch-Duke <HI>Maximilian,</HI> who had with him about 18000 Men: He likewise repuls'd the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> with only 3000 Men, who were coming to invade <HI>Poland</HI> with 70000. About the same time also, <HI>Chodkievicz,</HI> with no more than 3000, routed the <HI>Suedes</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> kil∣ling 9000, and taking 4000 Prisoners. <HI>Sta∣rovolscius</HI> has some few other Instances of the <HI>Polish</HI> Valour; but whether what I have al∣ready mention'd will be credited by your <HI>GRACE,</HI> and the Publick, I am not able to determine: However, I may affirm, that this Author hath never hitherto been esteem'd for Fabulous.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Quali∣ties neces∣sary in War.</NOTE> What I have remaining to say, as to the <HI>Poles</HI> Force, is, That however great it has hi∣therto been, yet is it rather to be attributed to their good Fortune, than Conduct; for two principal Qualities to make a Warlike En∣terprise especially, successful, have ever been Strangers to them: These are, The Power to keep a Secret; and an exact Intelligence of their Enemy's Advances, and Condition. As to a Secret, which is the Soul of all great Proceedings; that is so little observ'd in <HI>Po∣land,</HI> that scarce the meanest Officer in the Army, but knows what the General intends to do almost as soon as himself: And, for In∣telligence of the Posture and Capacity of the Enemy, by reason they make use of no Spies, they never know any thing of the matter till they happen to meet a Party, and take them Prisoners; from whom they are accustom'd to extort Confessions in Cases of Obstinacy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Soldiers <HI>Pay;</HI> from what it a∣rises, and how raised.</NOTE> As to the Pay of the <HI>Polish</HI> Army, I have shew'd before how it is executed; now I must give some short Account, from what it arises, and the manner of Raising it. It ari∣ses either from Occasional Impositions, or Perpetual Customs, and Yearly Taxes: Of the former Kind, are, a General Poll, or Ca∣pitation; and Voluntary Gifts of the Clergy, for they cannot be Tax'd by the State. Of the latter Sort, are, All fix'd Duties upon the <HI>Jews, Tartars,</HI> Land, Merchandize, Art, &amp;c. From Yearly Taxes, all Scholars, and such as busie themselves in Study, are excepted. The Fourth Part of the King's Revenue, set apart for maintaining a Guard on the Frontiers,
<PB N="27" REF="138"/>
may likewise be rank'd under this Denomi∣nation of Fix'd Duties. The manner of Rai∣sing these Taxes and Duties, is, for the most part, left to the King's Discretion, tho' some∣times the <HI>Diet</HI> assumes that Authority, as like∣wise to supervise the Distribution of the Mo∣ney rais'd. It may be observ'd, that a Col∣lector's Office is to last no longer than the Im∣position he is to collect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provisions and Am∣munition, what.</NOTE> As to Provisions, there are no Sutlers in the <HI>Polish▪</HI> Army, for two Reasons; <HI>First▪</HI> Because they would never be paid for what they sold; and then, tho' they durst venture, yet they would run no ordinary risque to be plunder'd before they reach'd the Camp; and this espe∣cially by the <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> who are generally more given that way than the <HI>Poles.</HI> There are likewise no Magazins, as in other Coun∣tries; so that the Officers especially are oblig'd to have great Equipages, and many Carriages, to convey their Necessaries along with them, where-ever they march: Among these, their Tents are extraordinary fine, tho' very heavy. Also, neither the King, nor Republick of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> has any publick Armories, or Arsenals; tho' it be true that <HI>Uladislaus Jagello</HI> instituted some few Repositories for Great Cannon, yet, which are now of no great Consequence; and those, which are in far greater Numbers, and much more useful, are chiefly in the Hands of the Gentry, or in the great Cities; whence, as often as the King has Occasion, he either takes them at Pleasure, or at Suf∣ferance.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="139"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gun-Foun∣ders, Fo∣reign.</NOTE> <HI>Poland</HI> likewise being not wanting in Metal, several new Cannon are founded, whenever the Old become unserviceable; the which, for the most part, is perform'd by the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> not being so skilful in that Art. The Arms the <HI>Polanders</HI> generally use, I have spoken of before; yet it may not be impro∣per to add what <HI>Hartknoch</HI> says of the Antient <HI>Polish</HI> Historians; which is, <HI>That they affirm, that formerly the</HI> Poles <HI>made use of a very hea∣vy sort of Arms; insomuch that when</HI> Bole∣slaus <HI>II. in his Expedition against the</HI> Prussians, <HI>waded with his Army through the River</HI> Ossa, <HI>many of his Soldiers were drown'd meerly by the Weight of their Arms.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For Fortifi∣cations.</NOTE> For Castles, <HI>Poland</HI> has a great Number, scarce any considerable City or Town being without one; yet which are now of little or no Use, except some few which are still kept up, the rest being suffer'd to decay by the Nobles that have got Possession of them. The Cause of the first Fortifications in <HI>Poland</HI> was on Ac∣count of the frequent Incursions of its Neigh∣bours; tho' <HI>Now</HI> (says <HI>Starovolscius,</HI> speak∣ing of himself, and his Country▪men) <HI>being not desirous of invading others, we find that we are sufficiently capable to defend our selves with our Bodies; tho, were we otherwise inclin'd, we might raise as strong Fortifications as any in</HI> Europe; <HI>yet, which we look upon to be not so consistent with true Courage and Valour.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretended Advanta∣ges thereby.</NOTE> It is certain, that Unfortify'd Countries lie most expos'd to sudden Irruptions, as this Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> has often experienc'd: But then this Mischief continues but a little
<PB N="29" REF="139"/>
while; for, as soon as the Nobility can be got together, the Invaders are generally for∣ced to retire; as may appear by several Exam∣ples in our Modern Histories alone. These Maxims of the <HI>Poles,</HI> to have few or no Forti∣fy'd Places, are founded upon several potent Reasons; for they thereby promote the Per∣sonal Valour of their own Men, and weaken that of their Enemies, by not leaving either a Place of Retreat. If we reflect on those <HI>States</HI> that have a great many Fortifications, we shall find, that with the Loss of but one Bat∣tel, they have been in a manner ruin'd; for the Enemies being once got into their Strong-Holds, are not easily forc'd out of them: When, on the contrary, the <HI>Poles</HI> always rally in a Field-Battle; and having no Places to retire to, either for themselves, or their Enemies, never give out till they have totally excluded their Invaders. Besides, the <HI>Poles</HI> look upon Garrisons to be the Promoters of Effeminacy and Softness, by the Examples of several He∣roes of Antiquity; for the Courages of <HI>Ale∣xander</HI> and <HI>Hannibal</HI> were altogether enervated by their Revels at <HI>Persepolis</HI> and <HI>Capua;</HI> and <HI>Boleslaus,</HI> bury'd, as it were, in his Debauches at <HI>Kiovia.</HI></P>

Besides, those of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who have the best Fortunes, generally spend too much of their Revenues in costly Habits and Luxury to be able to undergo any considera∣ble matters in Traffick. Also this Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> is not in the least commodious for such an undertaking, it not having any con∣siderable Port, that of <HI>Dantzic</HI> only excepted, which would suffice for the exotick Trade of so vast a Country. Hence it follows, that what Commodities are transported into Foreign Countries are so very inconside∣rable, that tho' they are of several sorts, and of general use, yet being counterpois'd by the incredible quantity, and richer variety of foreign Merchandize, they scarce suffice for Balance to the Cloth, Silk, Jewels, Tapestry, Fruit, Spice, Salt-Fish, Wine, Tin, Steel, &amp;c. Imported from <HI>England, Flanders, Portugal, Spain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commidi∣ties Expor∣ted and Im∣ported.</NOTE> <HI>Starovolscius</HI> enumerates the divers particu∣lars Exported and Imported, wherein it may not be improper to follow him. He says, that over and above those already mentioned,
<PB N="36" REF="143"/>
there are likewise rich Furrs, Gold and Sil∣ver, both wrought and unwrought, and great variety of Kickshaws and Delicacies Import∣ed, and as for what are Exported, they are Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rie, Millet, and all sorts of Grain and Pulse, Wooll, Hemp, Flax, Hops, a sort of Herb for Dying, Hides, Tallow, Tann'd Leather, Furrs brought out of <HI>Musao∣vy,</HI> but drest here, and transported from hence. Likewise <HI>Polish</HI> Furrs, Honey, Wax, Amber, Pitch, Pot-ashes, Masts, Planks, and several Materials both for Shipwrights and other Builders. <HI>Poland</HI> also exports, Salt, Beer, Opium, Vitriol, Nitre, <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> Vermil∣lion, Brass, Lead, Iron, Copper, Pit-Coal, Glass, and Earthen Ware. Moreover it sup∣plies the Neighbouring Countries with Horses very much coveted for their swiftness, hardi∣ness, and easy pace. It also furnishes other Nations with vast numbers of Oxen, Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c. with which it greatly abounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">But little Money, and why.</NOTE> Notwithstanding all these Exportations, yet as I said before, the Trade of <HI>Poland</HI> is over∣balanc'd by Foreign Commodities, whence it comes to pass, that there is but little Money to be met with in that Kingdom. What small matters the Merchants receive for their Goods at <HI>Dantzic,</HI> they generally give to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> &amp;c. for Wine; nevertheless, they have some Foreign Coin, and some of their own stirring amongst them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coin most current in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> That which is most current in the King∣dom, is either all of Copper, or Copper mixt with Silver, tho' they have likewise some few Silver and Gold Coins of their own. The
<PB N="37" REF="143"/>
two first of these sorts are the most common, and which are always Coined in such small pieces, that it is very troublesome either re∣ceiving or paying out any Sum. Of the first kind are their <HI>Chelons,</HI> being of Copper Sil∣ver'd over, whereof three make a <HI>Polish</HI> Gross, (the <HI>Grosses</HI> of <HI>Dantzic</HI> being of greater value) and three <HI>Grosses,</HI> the value of Two Pence of their Money: Tho' <HI>Hauteville</HI> says, these nine <HI>Chelons</HI> are not worth above a <HI>French Sous.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contributes to Poverty.</NOTE> This base <HI>Polish</HI> Coin contributes very much towards the Poverty of this Kingdom. It was introduc'd on Account of Necessity, when the <HI>Poles</HI> had no Money to pay their Army, which began to Confederate, and join in a <HI>Rokosz,</HI> for want of it. It is not likewise of late Days that this Coin has been introduced, for the Officers of <HI>Casimir</HI> III. are said to have coin'd it; and which was af∣terwards grievously exclaim'd against at the <HI>Diet</HI> held at <HI>Petrikow,</HI> in the Year 1459, un∣der the Reign of <HI>Casimir</HI> the Great. In those Days, it seems, the Kings had a Power to coin Money; and the first that resign'd his Right to the Republick, was <HI>Sigismond</HI> III. in the Year 1632.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Coins.</NOTE> The next of their Coins are called <HI>Chou∣stacks,</HI> being small pieces of Silver of base alloy, whereof three make a <HI>Tinfe,</HI> which is also a sort of Silver Money of base Alloy. This was first Coin'd to satisfie the Mutinous Army in the Year 1663, of the value of about 15 <HI>d.</HI> These Coins are not the same in <HI>Prussia</HI> and <HI>Dantzic,</HI> as shall be shew'd hereafter. The <HI>Polish</HI> Silver Coins of good Alloy, are the <HI>Attine,</HI> or four
<PB N="38" REF="144"/>
pence halfpenny, and the <HI>Trigross,</HI> and <HI>Segross,</HI> the former of which two last is three, and the latter six times the value of a <HI>Gross:</HI> Yet of these three there are at this day but very few remaining. As for Gold Coins, <HI>Casimir</HI> the Great was the first that caus'd any to be stamp'd in <HI>Poland,</HI> but of which, either Coin'd by that King or his Successors, there are few now made use of, the Silver and Gold Coins that have any Currency in the Kingdom, being for the most part Foreign. Those of Gold are <HI>Ducats,</HI> which are worth two <HI>French</HI> Crowns, or two <HI>German</HI> Rixdollars. Those of Silver are generally of the <HI>German</HI> Coin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> not very rich, and why.</NOTE> Tho' it may hereby appear, that the <HI>Polish</HI> Wealth is not over considerable, yet says <HI>Sta∣rovolscius,</HI> it has always been sufficient to de∣fray the Expences of the Kingdom, without the help of any Neighbours, tho' the same Author afterwards gives this Character of his Countrymen; that they are not over rich by reason of their sending the greatest part of their Commodities abroad, and generally re∣ceiving nothing in return, but such as serve to support Luxury, and encourage Vice. <HI>Hauteville</HI> gives another reason why the <HI>Poles</HI> may not be so rich as formerly, which is, because of the many and frequent Incursions of the <HI>Muscovites, Turks, Cosacks,</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> into this Kingdom, who were accustomed to carry off great num∣bers into slavery, and thereby to dis-people the Country; also by reason of the many bloody Wars, and sweeping Pestilencies which this Country has undergone.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particu∣lars of Trade.</NOTE> Having already spoken of the Trade of <HI>Po∣land</HI> in general, it may not be here amiss to entertain your <HI>Excellency</HI> with some particu∣lars relating thereunto. And first I shall ob∣serve something of Salt, which was omitted in the first Volume of this Undertaking.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning Salt.</NOTE> The Spaces, or Allies, which I there took notice of are form'd by rows of large Pillars cut out of the Salt to keep the Earth from fal∣ing in, and which, by reflection of the Light make a very agreeable Prospect, seem∣ing so many Rows of sparkling Chrystal. The Salt is taken out of these Mines in huge Mas∣ses, and laid in heaps all about the entrance, whence it is transported in Carriages through∣out the whole Kingdom, except <HI>Prussia</HI> only, where <HI>French</HI> Salt is alone made use of. This Salt is ground in Mills like Corn. The Gen∣try of this Kingdom have a right to any of these Mines, as likewise to those of any Me∣tals found upon their Lands; there being by the Constitutions no Royal Mines in <HI>Poland,</HI> except those of white Salt only, which belong peculiarly to the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No Fulling or Paper-Mills.</NOTE> Throughout all <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania</HI> there are a great many Corn and <HI>Cachat</HI>-Mills, but scarce any for Fulling, or Paper, yet which they might very well have, by reason of their great number of rapid Streams. In this, and in other respects, the <HI>Poles</HI> are very negligent of their own Interest, being content to pay great rates for Cloth and Paper, when they might easily have both of their own Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="145"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning Leather and Fish.</NOTE> As for Leather, tho' no People use it more, (having almost all Boots and Chariots, which they call <HI>Ridevans)</HI> yet do they not care to take the trouble of dressing it themselves, but suffer Foreigners to do it for them, and which commonly they pay very dear for when done. The <HI>Poles</HI> Trade very much in fresh Fish amongst themselves, and the manner of their Fishing, I imagine, may not be unacceptable to your <HI>Excellency,</HI> having something peculiar in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Fishing.</NOTE> Their Lakes and Fish-ponds in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania</HI> being generally so large, that it would be almost impossible ever to drain them, They usually choose to Fish them in Winter when they are all frozen up. They first make a great hole in the Ice to let down their Nets, and afterwards several little ones from place to place, that they may draw them along from hole to hole with a Rope fast∣ned to a long Pole, till they bring them back to the first large opening; When the two ends of the Nets are brought together, they pull them up, and bring out with them all the Fish that happen to be within the space of Water thro' which the Nets were drawn, for they cannot possibly leap over them, because of the Ice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Honey, and its Produce.</NOTE> Throughout all <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> there are huge quantities of Honey to be found in the Woods, either in hollow Trees, holes of the Ground, or any where else that the Bees can find to settle in. Of this Honey, as I said before, the People make several sorts of Mead, with which, and the Wax that comes from it, they Trade very much into the
<PB N="41" REF="145"/>
Neighbouring Countries. Now is it not a great wonder, that these Bees can produce so great plenty of Honey in so Cold a Climate? But it seems they find something in the Fir-Trees, whereof there are great num∣bers in every Wood, that supplies the place of Flowers, which they suck their materials from in other Countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Former Trade of <HI>Prussia.</HI></NOTE> Before I proceed to give your <HI>Excellency</HI> a description of the Famous City of <HI>Dantzic,</HI> I must take some cursory Notice of the for∣mer Trade of <HI>Prussia,</HI> before its Inhabitants came to have the use of Money. In the XIIIth Century, the <HI>Teutonic</HI> Knights coming out of <HI>Germany</HI> into <HI>Prussia,</HI> brought along with them the Coin of their Country, for before that time the <HI>Prussians</HI> only barter'd Commodities with their Neighbours. Their chiefest Trade then lay in <HI>Electrum,</HI> or <HI>Amber,</HI> of the Na∣ture of which, <HI>Hartman,</HI> a late <HI>German</HI> Au∣thor gives this account. He says, that since it can neither be melted down nor is Malle∣able, it is impossible it should be Metal, and because it is too solid a Body to come under the <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> or <HI>Bitumen,</HI> it must ne∣cessarily be rank'd among the precious Stones. This Amber is of divers Colours, and not∣withstanding <HI>Hartman</HI> insinuates it to be al∣ways solid, yet is it certain, that sometimes it is as liquid as Oyl. There is a black sort of it, which is no other than what we call Jett.</P>

It has a large and high Wall, so broad, that Coaches easily go round the Ramparts, and so large in com∣pass, that it is three hours Journey round, which I may very well compute at six <HI>English</HI> Miles. At the Entrance of the <HI>Rodawn,</HI> on the other side, it has a strong Fort, wherein there is commonly kept a Garrison of 1000 Soldiers. It is impossible this City should be Bombarded from the Sea, by reason of its di∣stance from it, but from the Neighbouring Hills it may, and therefore some Works are raised there, and always a certain num∣ber of Soldiers, with store of Cannon and Ammunition plac'd in them for its greater se∣curity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DR. <HI>Connor</HI> having design'd this Letter for your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Entertainment, and not having had leisure to accomplish it himself, by reason of the urgency of his Profession, desired of me to Address it for him; but up∣on a just Reflection on the meanness of my Abilities, and an awful Regard to your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Grandeur, I found I had more than ordinary reason to decline it: Yet, however, upon balancing your goodness with your great Quality, and considering my well meaning at the same time with my attempt, I hop'd I might not be so unfortunate as to Offend if I undertook it, and the rather, because of the great conformity which the subject I were to write of, had with the hopes which the Na∣tion has in you.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="151"/><HI>My LORD,</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Origin of</HI> Teutonic Order.</NOTE> Your Lordship will here find, that this <HI>Order</HI> was first founded to reward and encourage Great Actions, and that particularly in the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Nation, whence it came to have the Title of <HI>Teutonic;</HI> for when the Emperour <HI>Frederic Barbe∣rossa</HI> had engaged in the <HI>Crusade</HI> for recovery of the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> a great number of <HI>German</HI> Nobility and Gentry joyn'd his Army as Vo∣lunteers. Of this <HI>Crusade</HI> were several other great Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> such as <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France; Richard</HI> I. King of <HI>England; Frederic</HI> Duke of <HI>Suabia;</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Bavaria; Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders; Plorant</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> &amp;c. After this Emperor's Death, the <HI>Germans</HI> being before <HI>Acon,</HI> or <HI>Ptolemais</HI> which they then besieged, chose for their Leaders <HI>Frederick</HI> Duke of <HI>Suabia,</HI> second Son to the aforesaid Emperour; and <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Bra∣bant.</HI> Under these Generals they behav'd themselves so well, both at the taking of <HI>Acon, Jerusalem,</HI> and other places of the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> that <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>Patriarch,</HI> and several other Princes, thought themselves oblig'd to do something extraordinary in honour of the <HI>German</HI> Nation. Hereupon they immediately resolv'd to erect an <HI>Order</HI> of Knights of that Nation, under the prote∣ction of St. <HI>George,</HI> but afterwards they chan∣g'd that Saint for the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> by reason that she had an Hospital already founded on Mount <HI>Sion</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for the relief of <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Pilgrims, of the manner of building which, <HI>Ashmole,</HI> in his <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Garter</HI> gives this following account.</P>

Afterwards obtaining leave of the Patriarch, he erected a Chappel for them, and Dedicated it to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> whence the Knights that were established there afterwards, came to have the Title of <HI>Equites Mariani.</HI> Other <HI>German</HI> Gentlemen contributed largely to the maintaining and encreasing this Charitable Work, insomuch, that in a short time these Knights became very numerous and wealthy, and gave themselves to Military Employments, and to acts of Piety and Charity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <HI>Order</HI> confirm'd, and by what Title.</NOTE> In the Year 1190 they elected their first Great Master, <HI>Henry Walpot,</HI> and in the Year following had their Order confirm'd, upon the request of the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> VI. by the <HI>Rull</HI> of Pope <HI>Celestine</HI> III. under the Title of <HI>Teutonic,</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Knights, of the Hospi∣tal of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the Virgin, vowing Poverty, Obedience, and Chastity, and obliging them∣selves to receive none but <HI>Germans</HI> into their <HI>Order.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the State of Learning, and present Lan∣guage; of Natural Knowledge, and par∣ticularly of the Practise of Physick in <HI>Poland;</HI> with an account of some Natu∣ral Things, and chiefly of a Disease in the Hair peculiar to the <HI>Poles,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Plica Polonica.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Letter courts your Acceptance on a double score, your Learning and your Profession. As to your Learning, tho' it will doubtless be on all Hands allow'd, that it has no need of Superstructure, yet neverthe∣less, sometimes it may require those Diver∣sions which are here design'd, and possibly, in part, unknown to you: And as to your Profession, being highly sensible of my im∣perfect account of the state of Physick, espe∣cially in <HI>Poland,</HI> I thought no Protection so safe to pass it under as yours. My presumption, I hope, will be justifi'd upon Dr. <HI>Connor</HI>'s first intending these Subjects for your Perusal;
<PB N="75" REF="166"/>
and as to my Performance, I entirely submit that to your Candour and Generosity.</P>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Uni∣versities.</NOTE> In the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> there are two famous Universities, with all sorts of Professors. The former of these was Founded at <HI>Cracow</HI> by <HI>Casimir</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> and was finish'd by <HI>Jagello,</HI> or <HI>Uladislaus</HI> V. in the Year 1401, conforma∣ble to the last Will and Testament of his Queen <HI>Hedwigis;</HI> And the latter at <HI>Vilna,</HI> be∣ing at first but an <HI>Academy</HI> Founded by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> but afterwards was erected into an University by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> XIII. at the Re∣quest of <HI>Valerian</HI> Bishop of that City, who had very much augmented the Colleges and Endowments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Stu∣dy there.</NOTE> In both these Universities the Chief Study is to speak good <HI>Latin,</HI> for as to all parts of Po∣lite Learning, the <HI>Poles</HI> are not so curious as in other Countries, yet have they a great ma∣ny that will write good Verses, for their Genius is mightily bent that way; and besides, they are very apt to quote Classick Authors in their Discourse, and this particularly when they get Drunk, which is very frequently. Their Poet <HI>Sarbievius Casimir</HI> is no small Or∣nament to his Country, who, in his <HI>Odes,</HI> has endeavour'd to imitate <HI>Horace;</HI> and the Purl∣ty of Language is not contemptible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Learning formerly.</NOTE> They have had several <HI>Latin</HI> Historians a∣mong them, such as <HI>Cromerus, Starovolscius,</HI> &amp;c. who have all Written the <HI>Annals</HI> and <HI>Con∣stitutions</HI> of their Country. They have like∣wise
<PB N="76" REF="167"/>
had some <HI>Historians,</HI> who have written in their own Language. They also have not wanted for Learned <HI>Divines,</HI> Great <HI>Philoso∣phers,</HI> Famous <HI>Astronomers, Logicians,</HI> &amp;c. The great Astronomer <HI>Nicolaus Copernicus</HI> was a Native of this Country, having had his Birth in the City of <HI>Thorn</HI> in Regal-<HI>Prussia.</HI> The reason why these Learned Men have not transmitted more to Posterity was, because that while they liv'd there was but little or no Printing in <HI>Poland,</HI> that Art having been but lately receiv'd in this Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oriental Languages dis-regard∣ed.</NOTE> Tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> are so extreamly expert in Speaking and Writing <HI>Latin,</HI> yet are they not curious in any of the Oriental Languages. They affect speaking <HI>Latin</HI> to that degree, that Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> has inform'd me, that he had a Servant while he was in <HI>Poland,</HI> that always us'd to talk to him in that Language; and I have moreover read, that almost all the Com∣mon People speak <HI>Latin</HI> fluently there, a proof of which you may please to observe in the first Volume of this History, in the Life of <HI>Stephen Batori,</HI> who very much pro∣moted the Study of that Language.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Present Languages in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> As the <HI>Poles</HI> have the same Origin with the <HI>Muscovites, Bohemians, Croatians, Moravians, Sile∣sians, Cassubians, Bulgarians, Rascians, Servians, Il∣lyrians,</HI> &amp;c. so <HI>(Cromerus</HI> says) they have like∣wise the same Language with them, altho' they differ in <HI>Dialects,</HI> and that scarce to be understood by each other. Their terms of Mechanic Arts are chiefly borrow'd from the Ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> who formerly had, as still they have, frequent intercourses with
<PB N="77" REF="167"/>
this Country. Nay, there are at present whole Towns and Villages that make use of the <HI>German</HI> Tongue, that Nation having formerly planted several Colonies in this Kingdom. Also there are several of the Noble Families purely <HI>German,</HI> as may appear both by their Names and Coats of Arms. Likewise <HI>He∣brew, Armenian, Russian, Tartarian,</HI> and in some places <HI>Italian,</HI> are frequently spoken in this Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polish</HI> hard to Pronounce.</NOTE> The <HI>Polish</HI> Language <HI>Cromerus</HI> allows, is neither so Copious, nor so easy to Pronounce as those of other Nations, but as the <HI>French, Italian,</HI> &amp;c. consists chiefly of Vowels, that of <HI>Poland</HI> is made up in great measure with Consonants, insomuch, that you shall some∣times meet with <HI>Polish</HI> Words that have seven or eight Consonants together without any Vowel, or at most but one, interpos'd, an Ex∣ample of which, Sir, you may have in the word <HI>Chrzeszcz (Scarabaeus,</HI> a <HI>Gad-Flie,)</HI> this, with divers others in the <HI>Polish</HI> Tongue, scarce the Natives themselves are able to Pronounce, yet they always have a sort of lisping sound of Vowels in their Pronunciation, tho' they do not write them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why the <HI>Poles</HI> af∣fect <HI>Latin.</HI></NOTE> It must not be understood, however uni∣versally <HI>Latin</HI> is spoken in <HI>Poland,</HI> that the <HI>Poles</HI> have it from their Mothers, as the Com∣mon People have in some parts of <HI>Hungary,</HI> for they take pains to learn it from Masters as o∣ther Nations do. The chiefest reasons why they generally Affect it is, First from their Natural Dispositions to learn it. Secondly, By reason of the <HI>Syntax</HI> of their Mother-Tongue

the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> which has great Af∣finity with that Language, for they both de∣cline their Nouns, and Conjugate their Verbs as the <HI>Romans</HI> did. Thirdly, Because in all the Villages throughout the Nation, they have School-masters for that purpose, who are either Rectors of Parishes, or some other qualifi'd Persons appointed by them, or by the Bishop of the Diocess. And fourthly, because in all Towns of Note, the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have Colleges set apart to instruct Youth in that Language.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Have no so∣lid Learn∣ing.</NOTE> As for depth in any Learning or Sciences, Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> informs me, he could never meet with any Persons in <HI>Poland</HI> so solidly vers'd in them, as he has done in other Nations, for that the <HI>Poles,</HI> as soon as they can speak <HI>La∣tin,</HI> and discourse of most matters in that Lan∣guage, never think of any farther Know∣ledge, but believe they have acquir'd all the Learning, and all Accomplishments that ei∣ther Universities or Schools can give them, unless they be Persons that make some parti∣cular Science their Profession; As <HI>Divines, Physicians,</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> of all which I shall proceed to give some particular account, as they stand at present in that Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How far that of Di∣vines ex∣tends.</NOTE> The <HI>Divines</HI> in <HI>Poland</HI> make all their Learn∣ing consist in adapting <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Logicks,</HI> and <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> to their School-<HI>Divinity,</HI> so that you may every where hear them talk much of <HI>Entities, Modes, Quiddities, Essences</HI> of Things, and the like, for they value themselves more in being well vers'd in the signification of <HI>Lo∣gical</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="168"/>
Terms, than in the Nature of Things themselves, which they reason about. In this Country they have a particular Veneration for <HI>Albertus Magnus,</HI> and quote him to attest the Truth of any Assertion, in like manner as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> are accustom'd to do <HI>Aristotle,</HI> tho' they have not less respect for this last <HI>Philosopher</HI> than other Nations have. Yet, notwithstanding, they seldom take right his meaning, and particularly in matters that are Ambiguous, for they have Publish'd seve∣ral large <HI>Commentaries</HI> upon him which do frequently contradict one another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Di∣vinity.</NOTE> The <HI>Polish Divines</HI> are seldom well vers'd in Practical <HI>Divinity.</HI> They study but little the Old and New Testament. They make few Enquiries into the Practice of Primitive Christianity, and know little of <HI>Church</HI>-Hi∣story. In a word, they trouble their Heads but seldom about convincing their Reason of the Sublimity and Goodness of the Christian Doctrine; implicit Faith, and Passive Obedi∣ence to Council and Church-Decisions being entirely their Guides. They will allow of no body's enquiring into the reasonableness of Things, as if they should imagine, that a Law, or a Doctrine given by God should not be consistent with Reason. They have a more than ordinary respect for <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> and <HI>Scotus,</HI> and their principal Erudition consists in being well Read in the School-Points con∣troverted by those two Great Men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawyers; their num∣ber and stu∣dy.</NOTE> As for Lawyers there are a great number in <HI>Poland,</HI> and that chiefly at the two Great Tri∣bunals of <HI>Petricovia</HI> and <HI>Lublin.</HI> These study

the Civil-<HI>Law,</HI> tho' they have likewise several Statutes of their own which they term <HI>Con∣stitutions.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who seldom go to Law.</NOTE> The <HI>Grandees</HI> of the Kingdom seldom go to Law, for they generally decide their Quar∣rels by the Sword, bringing numerous Ar∣mies into the Field against each other: But if it happen sometimes that they do condescend, to submit to Justice, even then their Pride will never allow them to refer their Case to any other Court than the Grand <HI>Diet.</HI> Also the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation in general is not much en∣clin'd to go to Law, by reason of the litigi∣ousness and corruption of the <HI>Lawyers,</HI> for the <HI>Poles</HI> have as little Opinion of the honesty of that Profession as any People in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A suppos'd Judgment on a Law∣yer.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> was once sent for to a <HI>Lawyer</HI> that lay sick at <HI>Warsaw.</HI> His Disease, the Dr. says, was a Cancer on his Tongue, which had swell'd it to that prodigious bigness, that it had not only fill'd all his Mouth, but also hung about an Inch out of it, insomuch, that he could neither speak one word, nor breath through his Lips, but had that bene∣fit only by his Nose. This Disease, the Dr. says, he at first judg'd to be incurable, and so in effect it prov'd, for he died soon after. This Person it seems had purchas'd a plenti∣ful Estate by the Law, wherefore the People could not be perswaded but that the cause of his Death was a Judgment upon him, believ∣ing it Just, I suppose, that that Tongue which had been the occasion of wronging so many People, should nevertheless do Justice on its Master.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians, and their Abilities.</NOTE> As for <HI>Physicians</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> there are no great number there, and those few that are, for the most part are either <HI>French, Italians,</HI> or <HI>Germans,</HI> scarce any of the Natives caring to addict themselves to that Profession; for having little conveniency to improve them∣selves in it in their own Country, none but the richer sort of Gentry can bear the expence of going to learn it in Foreign Countries, and then such of the Nobility as do Travel are generally either too Lazy or too Proud to ap∣ply themselves to what requires so much fa∣tigue to study, and so much judgment after∣wards to put in Practise. This, <HI>Sir,</HI> is the reason why the <HI>Poles</HI> have hardly any Person throughly learn'd in this Profession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not allow∣ed to study till qualifi∣ed.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> tells me, that he met with a young Physician at <HI>Rome,</HI> that came thither from <HI>Poland</HI> to pick up Experience. Some of his Country-men that were then in that City told the <HI>Doctor,</HI> that he was Son to a rich Pea∣sant in their Nation, and that his Father was Vassal, as they term'd him, or Slave to one <HI>Starosta Cowalski;</HI> moreover, that his Father, for the consideration of 100 <HI>Rixdollars</HI> had bought his Freedom, and afterwards sent him to the University, and from thence to Travel, for without having first bought his Liberty he could not have sent him out of the Service of his Lord, his Service being as much the Lord's Inheritance as his Land was.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural Observa∣bles and Rarities.</NOTE> BEfore I proceed to give you an Account of the Diseases and Practice of Physick in <HI>Poland,</HI> I must here desire leave to enter∣tain you with some Observables and Natural Rarities of this Country, extracted as well from Dr. <HI>Connor</HI>'s Memoirs taken there, as out of the best Modern Authors that have writ∣ten of this Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Wood and Earth.</NOTE> In <HI>Russia,</HI> all along the River <HI>San,</HI> there have been several Trees found buried, having no Roots, and being as black as Ebony. The Country People say, that they have lain there ever since the Deluge, but it is probable they might have been washed down by the course of that River a great while since, and preserv∣ed from rotting by the Sand. There are se∣veral places both in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania</HI> where petrefi'd Wood is to be found; like∣wise several Beds of Earth lying one upon a∣nother,
<PB N="83" REF="170"/>
whose substance is not unlike that of the Unicorn's Horn. Also <HI>Argentum Ca∣pillare,</HI> or <HI>Vegetans,</HI> being Silver, hanging from Rocks in the nature of Hair.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Waters and their Effects</NOTE> Near <HI>Javorisvia,</HI> in the District of <HI>Leopol,</HI> in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Russia,</HI> there is a Lake, call'd by the <HI>Poles, Skla, (Glass,)</HI> where for∣merly there was a little Town, but which is now sunk into the Ground. The Water of this Lake has a strong, sulphurous, and stink∣ing Smell, but withal clear, like Chrystal, and of an insipid Taste. The Doctors of this Kingdom have recommended it to sick Per∣sons to Drink for recovery of their Healths, and one <HI>Sixtus Leo,</HI> a famous Physician of those parts, has written a Learned Treatise concerning it. It is much frequented, and does a great deal of good. There are like∣wise several natural Baths in this Kingdom, which cure all kinds of <HI>Scrofulous</HI> Diseases and Ulcers, both in Men and Beasts. In the County of <HI>Scepuz</HI> in Lesser-<HI>Poland,</HI> there is a sort of Spring that flows from the Rocks, which makes perfect Gutters of Stone as it runs from thence thro' the Meadows to the Mills. The Lake <HI>Biala</HI> (in <HI>Polish</HI> white) so call'd by <HI>Antiphrasis,</HI> in the Months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May</HI> makes the Fish that are in it <HI>Brown,</HI> tho' they afterwards return to their Natural Colours. I must not omit what <HI>Cromerus</HI> says of the Lake <HI>Crinice</HI> in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Belsko</HI> in <HI>Red-Russia,</HI> which is, that every second or third Year, it becomes wonderfully Tempe∣stuous, and in a little time discharges all its Waters thro' unknown Caverns, insomuch,
<PB N="84" REF="171"/>
that tho' before it were very deep, it of a sud∣den almost grows fordable, but then in a little time afterwards its Water returns with the same roaring noise it went out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrous Fish.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Conner,</HI> in his Memoirs says, that it was reported when he was in <HI>Poland,</HI> that the Year before he came thither a <HI>Barbel</HI> Fish was found in the River <HI>San,</HI> at <HI>Velasco,</HI> an Estate of the late Queens, which was above 4 <HI>Polish</HI> Ells long, which is better than 8 Foot of our measure, and near 3 Foot broad, and weighed at least 200 weight. He says that the same Species of Fish, of this largeness, are very common in that River, and one was re∣ported to have had an entire Skeleton of a Man, suppos'd to have been drown'd some time before, found in his Belly, together with a Knife and Sheath. This Fish has no Scales. He says likewise, that there are Fish in <HI>Lithu∣ania</HI> which are made use of to shew the change of Weather: For this purpose they are to be put into a Bottle, where they will make a sort of squeeking noise when the wea∣ther is to alter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowls of odd Qualities.</NOTE> As to odd kinds of Fowl, there are a sort of Birds near <HI>Lowitz</HI> in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of <HI>Rava</HI> in Lower-<HI>Poland,</HI> about the bigness of Spar∣rows, that appear and disappear with the Snow, and from thence have the Name given them of <HI>Snow-Birds.</HI> These are scarce to be seen any where else throughout the whole Kingdom. There are also a sort of <HI>Quails</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Podolia</HI> with Green Legs, and which being eaten cause the
<PB N="85" REF="171"/>
Cramp. There are moreover a kind of <HI>Swal∣lows</HI> and <HI>Martlets,</HI> that gathering up their Legs, and folding close their Wings will dive into the Water at the latter end of <HI>Autumn,</HI> and live there all the Winter, but as soon as the <HI>Spring</HI> returns they come out and fly a∣way. If they chance to be taken by Fisher-Nets in the Winter, tho' they will revive up∣on being laid near the Fire, yet do they sel∣dom survive long the Trespass upon the Or∣dination of their Nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts of strange kinds.</NOTE> In Great-<HI>Poland</HI> there are a sort of Hogs with uncloven-Feet, which differ in no other respect from our Hogs. In <HI>Poland</HI> likewise, but more especially in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> there are a kind of little Beasts like <HI>Weesels,</HI> call'd in <HI>Po∣lish, Zassicz,</HI> whose Fur is a little courser than <HI>Ermine,</HI> and in <HI>Summer</HI> is Brown; but as soon as the Snow appears, in one Night they be∣come all over White, and so continue till the <HI>Spring,</HI> when they resume their former Co∣lour: This Animal is something less than a Squirrel. I may here, Sir, give you a descrip∣tion of the wild Ox, being a Beast that is ve∣ry common in <HI>Poland.</HI> He, when full grown is of an extraordinary size, with large black Horns, and somewhat turn'd inwards towards the top. With these Horns he will common∣ly throw a Horse and its Rider into the Air, and moreover root up Trees of no ordinary Magnitude. Between his Horns two or three Men may sit a-breast. His hide is exceeding bristly, and under his Chin grow two or three very large Dew-laps. His Horns serve for use to Hunters. I might describe other
<PB N="86" REF="172"/>
strange Beasts that are to be found in this Country, but have omitted them by reason their descriptions are to be met with at large in <HI>Gesner</HI>'s History of <HI>Quadrupeds;</HI> only I may here observe farther, that the <HI>Polish</HI> Bears will live a great while, especially in the Winter, without Eating.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rarities communi∣cated to Dr. <HI>Con∣nor.</HI></NOTE> Sir, Before I conclude this account of na∣tural Knowledge, peculiar to <HI>Poland,</HI> I must entertain you with some rarities communica∣ted to Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> while he was in that King∣dom. His Memoirs inform me, that two Fryars whose Names were Father <HI>Lewis,</HI> and Father <HI>Fulgentius,</HI> shew'd him a Horse-shooe chang'd into Brass, and likewise gave him a piece of Iron turn'd into that Metal by Vir∣tue of a Spring in <HI>Hungary;</HI> likewise, that they shew'd him several pieces of natural Chrystal with running Water in the middle; And moreover, that the latter of these Fathers presented him with two pieces of Chrystal which he had off from the Mountains of <HI>Sa∣voye,</HI> and which he affirms to have been as white as Milk when he first broke them off the Rock, but that they afterwards became <HI>Diaphanous</HI> of themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argen∣tum Ful∣minans</HI> made by chance.</NOTE> I am moreover inform'd by the same means, that this Father <HI>Fulgentius</HI> made <HI>Argentum Ful∣minans</HI> by chance; the manner of which was this: He dissolv'd Silver in <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> and afterwards put crude <HI>Tartre</HI> pulveriz'd into the Dissolution, which likewise soon dissolv'd by the help of a little heat: After that he eva∣porated the Humidity, almost to a degree of dryness, in an Earthen Platter, and then en∣creas'd
<PB N="87" REF="172"/>
the heat, when all of a sudden, with∣out his expecting any such thing, the Powder flew up into a flash, gave a strange report, and fill'd and blacken'd all the Room where he was with Smoak. Of three Ounces of the Powder which he had in the Platter, there was scarce three Drams remain'd, but the Platter, notwithstanding, continu'd unbroke. His design in making this Powder was to Sil∣ver something over, for it seems the mixing Liquid Silver with <HI>Tartre</HI> will produce that Effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Ex∣periments.</NOTE> This Person likewise made an exquisite vo∣latile Salt of little <HI>Centaury,</HI> infus'd into fair Water with Yeast. Also he distill'd Wa∣ter from Roses which would set Gunpowder on Fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Ber∣nitz</HI>'s Ch∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Ra∣rities.</NOTE> I have now, Sir, but two things more to entertain you with before I come to the Pra∣ctise of Physick, &amp;c. in <HI>Poland,</HI> and one is a∣bout Dr. <HI>Bernitz,</HI> King <HI>John Casimir</HI>'s Phy∣sician's Closet of Rarities, which Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, in his Memoirs, was shewn him by that Physician's Wife at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> who spoke good <HI>Latin,</HI> in which Language he convers'd with her. This Collection consisted of a great number of petrefi'd Bodies of Raisins, Serpents, Wood, Toads, and the like. It likewise con∣tain'd a vast variety of Shells, Minerals, and Gums. There was also a <HI>Thermometre,</HI> in form of a <HI>Serpentine</HI> of many degrees, com∣puted by Elevations upon the Glass, and the least heat of the Hand would cause the Spirit of Wine to mount sensibly. There was moreover a Sea-Pigeon, or Fish like to a Pi∣geon,
<PB N="88" REF="173"/>
which hung up by a String; and Do∣ctor <HI>Connor</HI> says, Dr. <HI>Bernitz</HI>'s Wife assur'd him, that it would always turn to that quar∣ter where the Wind sat, as also that in moist Weather many drops of Water were wont to distil from it. In this Closet there were more∣over many huge Horns of <HI>Elks,</HI> and several prodigious Bones of other Creatures. All sorts of Plants also were there well preserv'd and pasted upon Paper. There were likewise a great many Designs painted and drawn very neatly by Dr. <HI>Bernitz</HI>'s own Hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner, of making Glass.</NOTE> The other Thing I propos'd to inform you of is the manner of making Glass in <HI>Poland,</HI> with some circumstances relating thereunto. The <HI>Poles</HI> make their Glass of Beech-Ashes and great Pebbles pounded; these they boyl together for twelve Hours, till such time as they begin to Vitrifie. When they have a mind to make their Glass clearer than ordinary, they are accustom'd to mix a particular sort of Earth with it of the colour and hardness of <HI>Tartre,</HI> which renders the Glass of different Colours, according to the greater or lesser quantity of this Earth mixt with it. I may observe that if Salt be mixt in the composition of this Glass it makes it more fluid and easier to be wrought by the Workman.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Odd Me∣thod of Cu∣ring Wounds.</NOTE> Sometimes the Labourers or their Children by treading about barefooted wound them∣selves with the pieces of Glass that lie about the Furnace, when they are accustom'd to have recourse to this odd remedy, which is, to take out a Ladleful of the red hot Metal, and clap it to the part afflicted, which presently, it
<PB N="89" REF="173"/>
seems, draws forth the Splinters of the Glass out of the Flesh, and afterwards upon clapping on an <HI>Anodine</HI> Plaister, it is soon heal'd.</P>

<HEAD>Practise of Physick, and Diseases in <HI>POLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Practise of Physick.</NOTE> AS for the Practice of Physick in <HI>Poland</HI> it is but very imperfect. The Doctors there know nothing of the Modern Discove∣ries in <HI>Anatomy</HI> and <HI>Chymistry,</HI> nay, the <HI>Ma∣teria Medica</HI> is hardly known to them, much less improv'd. The Medicines which they use are altogether <HI>Galenical,</HI> and those always of the worser sort. They are but little ac∣quainted with Modern Authors, and particu∣larly with those of our Nation, tho' they have heard of their Names, and will allow that the <HI>English Physicians</HI> have improv'd <HI>Phy∣sick</HI> beyond any other Nation whatever, but this is still more by hear-say than out of any knowledge they have of us or our Authors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Me∣dicines us'd</NOTE> They use all the means of curing Diseases that we do here, such as <HI>Mercury, Steel, An∣timony, Jesuits</HI>-Powder, Volatile Salts and Spi∣rits, all which are brought into <HI>Poland,</HI> chiefly to <HI>Warsaw,</HI> or else made there by <HI>German</HI> Apo∣thecaries. The late Queen's Apothecary was a <HI>German,</HI> and an expert <HI>Chymist.</HI> Tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> use the same Medicines as we do, yet are they ignorant of the Method of applying them. In their Consultations they advance but little reason, tho' they quote Presidents and Authors for their Practice.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="174"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diseases what?</NOTE> As to Diseases they have the same in <HI>Po∣land</HI> that are in other Countries; Venereal Distempers are very frequent, yet Salivation is not so much practis'd there as with us, for they pretend to cure the <HI>Lues</HI> by Sweating.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Venereal how Cur'd by a Quack.</NOTE> Dr <HI>Connor</HI> says, that in his time there liv∣ed an illiterate Fellow in a Wood, about six Miles from <HI>Warsaw,</HI> who undertook to Cure all Venereal Distempers in 7 or 8 Days at far∣thest, and that by a Bagnio, in which he boil∣ed 3 or four sorts of Plants, which he made a Secret of. The Doctor says, the <HI>Helleboraster,</HI> and the <HI>Capillus Veneris,</HI> or <HI>Maiden Hair,</HI> as well as he could discover were the chief. This Quack bath'd his Patients in a hot decoction of these Herbs for four days together, and made them drink of the same frequently while they were in the Bath. The other four days he laid them over the Tub to receive the hot Steams of the said Decoction, laying a Blanket over them to intercept any evapora∣tion, and to drive back the Steams upon the naked Body by way of <HI>Revarberatory,</HI> thro' which means they sweat extreamly. While they sweated he made them Drink of the De∣coction as before, so that by thus Sweating, Bathing and Drinking, Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, it was credibly assur'd him that he wrought many wonderful Cures in Venereal Cases▪ the <HI>Doctor</HI> says moreover, that 'tis certain that a great number of People flock'd fre∣quently to him, and that for the whole Cure he demanded no more than two Rixdollars.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="174"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surprizing particulars</NOTE> For other Diseases the <HI>Poles</HI> seldom or ne∣ver know any <HI>Scurveys,</HI> have rarely any Ma∣lignant <HI>Fevers</HI> among them, and those ne∣ver dangerous; and for <HI>Plurisies</HI> and the rest of Distempers, they are not for the most part of such ill consequence in <HI>Poland</HI> as in other Countries. Wounds and <HI>Ulcers</HI> in the Legs are most commonly thought incurable there. Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> informs me that the Princess <HI>Rad∣zivil,</HI> the late King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Sister, had her <HI>Menses</HI> at 64 years of Age. Also, that when he was at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> a Man having taken Physick, and lying with a Woman before its Operation, she was forth with violently purg'd, and he never so much as once went to Stool.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diseases peculiar to the <HI>Poles,</HI> and first the <HI>Plica.</HI></NOTE> I must now come to the two Diseases that are peculiar to the <HI>Poles,</HI> and so I will con∣clude. One of these is call'd by the Natives, <HI>Colton,</HI> and by us, <HI>Plica,</HI> and the other is term'd the <HI>Rose.</HI> The former is an odd kind of Distemper, and frequently mention'd in <HI>Physick</HI>-Authors. Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says it is one of the most remarkable Maladies that he has <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Descrip∣tion.</NOTE>ever met with, yet is nothing else but the Hair of the Head matted, entangled, and in ter∣woven like to fulled Cloth. Sometimes all the Hair of the Head will be thus Matted, so large that it covers the Shoulders, and so long that it comes down to the very Wast, which makes them that have it put it into a Purse that it may hang backwards; but generally speaking, it hangs in twisted Ropes, and that most com∣monly on one side only. Others have only their Hair plaited close to their Heads as little Children that are Scabby have; but however,
<PB N="92" REF="175"/>
those that have the <HI>Plica</HI> never have any Scabs. <HI>Hauteville</HI> compares this twisted Hair to the Ears of a Water-Spaniel. Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, that in his time a Gentleman at Court had it to that Degree, that his Hair hung like a Mantle about his Shoulders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unaccoun∣tableness.</NOTE> The Hair will be thus entangled in one Nights time, tho' there be never so much care taken to prevent it, for the <HI>Poles</HI> having their Hair always cut round above their Ears, like to that of Monks, tho' it had never been comb'd, yet were it impossible it should be∣come thus woven all of a sudden out of slovenlyness and carelesness, as a great many, and Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> himself says he believ'd, be∣fore he came into that Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Symptoms.</NOTE> The Symptoms of this Disease are not un∣like those of the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> as <HI>Rheumatick,</HI> and <HI>Arthritique</HI> pains, &amp;c. but then they ne∣ver occasion a <HI>Caries</HI> in the Bones, nor any Ulcers in the Mouth or elsewhere. When the Hair is cut it is commonly said that these Symptoms become more violent, and more∣over produce a cloudiness over the Eyes, and sometimes a total Blindness; also that it causes Head-aches, Pains in the Limbs, Vomitings, the Members all of a sudden to become di∣storted and stiff, the Nails of the Fingers to have little white spots on them, and Pimples and Pustules to come out all over the Body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Neither Bleeds nor is painful.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Connor</HI> says, however, that Authors mi∣stake when they attribute any such Accidents to the cutting of Hair in the <HI>Plica,</HI> for he in∣forms me that he has cut it himself, and that there neither came Blood, nor was there any Sensation, neither do the Natives affirm, that
<PB N="93" REF="175"/>
there is any upon such an occasion. <HI>Haute∣ville</HI> likewise says he has known the <HI>Plica</HI> cut without these effects before-mention'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Said to be Contagious and Here∣ditary.</NOTE> Some pretend that this Disease is contagi∣ous, and that if you lie with a Man that has it, and receive the Sweat from him, you will infallibly have it your self. Also there are those that are of Opinion that it is <HI>Hereditary,</HI> but however, it is certain some have had it whose Parents never had; it is thought there∣fore that it must needs proceed from the Nurse, but I shall not pretend to determine whether it does or not. Some say likewise that it has not always been in this Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Common to Men and Beasts.</NOTE> This Distemper is common both to Men and Beasts, for Horses, Dogs, &amp;c. have been frequently known to have had it. Strangers also get it when they have resided in <HI>Poland</HI> for any time, but <HI>Hauteville</HI> says they never have it tho' they continue there ever so long, and the reason he gives is, because as soon as their Hair begins to entangle they cut it off, which he says the <HI>Poles</HI> dare not do for fear of making themselves Blind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstiti∣on concern∣ing it, and other cases.</NOTE> The People are so superstitious concerning this Distemper, that there are some old Wo∣men among them that pretend to bring it out upon Children that are troubled with any languishing Disease, by mixing and twisting their Hair, and making their Mothers believe that they are only sick because the <HI>Plica</HI> cannot break forth. The <HI>Poles</HI> are likewise very su∣perstitious in other cases, for they dare not kill a Stork for fear of some misfortune happening to them thereupon. Besides, what I have mention'd before of their cutting off

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Cure by a Jew.</NOTE> The Cure of this Distemper was often ef∣fected by one Dr. <HI>Jonas,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> and Physi∣cian to the late King of <HI>Poland,</HI> after this man∣ner.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes As∣serted, but Question'd.</NOTE> Of the cause of the <HI>Plica,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> give this Account.

infected, and those that have since drank of them afflicted with this loathsom Disease. Notwithstanding this assertion, Dr. <HI>Con∣nor</HI> says, the true cause thereof continues yet a secret to Physicians. Strangers generally attribute the cause of it to slovenliness, and they are confirm'd in this opinion, because they are seldom troubled with it for reasons given before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another account of the Plica.</NOTE> Another Account of this Distemper I have met with in Dr. <HI>Connor</HI>'s Memoirs, asserted to him by the Bishop of <HI>Posnania.</HI> That Bi∣shop, it seems, inform'd him, that even while he was young he had the <HI>Plica,</HI> and that up∣on cutting it with his own Hands he became dim-sighted for some considerable time, and withal felt several pains and contorsions in his Limbs. He told him moreover, that he found divers seeming Incurvations of his Bones. Af∣terwards the Hair growing again it began to mat as before, but however, he was forbid, both by his Parents, and his Tutor, to make use of the same remedy to get rid of it, du∣ring which time his pains totally left him; but at length, being weary of so loathsom a Companion, he secretly cut off his Hair a∣gain, when immediately the former symp∣toms began to return with greater Violence than ever. Hereupon all the Servants of the House were caution'd against letting him have either Knife or Scissars for the future, to do himself so much injury as he had formerly done, notwithstanding which, a Kinsman of his commiserating his deplorable condition, pri∣vately convey'd a Knife to him, wherewith he cut off his Locks a third time, when, he
<PB N="96" REF="177"/>
assur'd the Doctor, he felt a thousand racking pains, and had various other symptoms of this Disease renew'd upon him. He inform'd him moreover, that in one Night the Hair will be thus Matted, even in those that take never so much care in Combing of it. He told him likewise, that the Symptoms and Pains were much greater when the Hair was often cut, than when it was let grow to any length. He also said, that the first and second time that he cut his Locks, he could sensibly perceive a vaporous and volatile matter pass in great abundance thro' the Ducts of his Hair, which he said, in its Passage, very much frizled and contracted his Locks. He more∣over affirm'd, that when he put a Cap upon his Head it occasion'd him intolerable heats and pain, by reason (said he) that the pres∣sure thereof repell'd the eruption, and forc∣ed back the Humours of the Disease upon his Head.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hairs Ca∣nular.</NOTE> From this Account of the Bishop of <HI>Posna∣nia,</HI> besides what we know already by <HI>Micro∣scopes,</HI> it evidently appears that every Hair is a kind of a little <HI>Tube,</HI> thro' which the nourishment, as well as those steams he men∣tion'd, may be reasonably suppos'd to pass to the utmost Extremities.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Dutchy of <HI>Curland,</HI> its present State and Government; with an Account of the Origin and Progress of the <HI>Li∣vonian Order,</HI> comprehending the seve∣ral Successions of its Knights down to <HI>Gothotred Ketler,</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Curland;</HI> As also a succinct Relation of the several Administrations of this Duke and his Successors.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI></P>
<P>I Hope the Addressing this following Let∣ter to you needs no Apology, since you were at first design'd to bear a part in the Pa∣tronage of this History. What your great Merits intitle you to I shall not pretend to determine here, reserving that Honour for a more favourable Opportunity, and a better subject, or at least a more correct Performance.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> The following Account is only the product of a hasty Compilation, gather'd out of a confus'd Account of this Country, which I could only meet with in Books. But however, if there be any Beautys discover'd, they are to be ascrib'd to the ingenious Baron
<PB N="99" REF="178" MS="y"/>
<HI>Blomberg,</HI> his late Highness the Duke of <HI>Cur∣land</HI>'s Minister, who, by means of Dr. <HI>Con∣nor,</HI> has furnish'd me with some short Ac∣count of the Present State of Affairs in that Dutchy. His Authority, I presume, will not be question'd by reason of his suppos'd Knowledge of those matters. A much far∣ther Account was promis'd by and expected from him, but the urgency of time (a con∣sideration too much regarded by Booksellers) requir'd this Abrupt Publication.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Present bounds and extent of <HI>Curland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sir,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Curland,</HI> which com∣prehends the Provinces of <HI>Curland</HI> and <HI>Semi∣gallia,</HI> is bounded on the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West</HI> by the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> on the <HI>East</HI> by the Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and on the <HI>South</HI> by the Dutchy and Province of <HI>Samogitia.</HI> In length it is about 50 great <HI>German</HI> Leagues, computing from <HI>Memel</HI> in <HI>Prussia</HI> to <HI>Riga</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> and reckoning at least six <HI>Prussian</HI> Leagues to a Mile. The breadth is different from the <HI>Baltic</HI> to <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Samogitia,</HI> being in some places 30, and in others but 24 Leagues broad, and moreover, in some places less.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Soil and former State.</NOTE> This Dutchy is a Plain, Champion, Fruit∣ful Country, and has always been well Inha∣bited. It is a part of <HI>Livonia,</HI> and when un∣der the <HI>Teutonic</HI> Knights was the better half of it, but now its Limits are not a little Abridg∣ed. Some have divided <HI>Livonia</HI> into <HI>Regal</HI> and <HI>Ducal,</HI> the former at present being under the King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and the latter under the Duke of <HI>Curland.</HI> Formerly about the IXth. Century, this last was likewise Subject to <HI>Sue∣den,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="179"/>
but then it paid only a certain Tribute, for it was never enter'd upon by the <HI>Swedes.</HI> Some Authors have affirm'd it to be a <HI>Penin∣sula,</HI> but those are easily confuted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">When whol∣ly Conquer∣ed.</NOTE> <HI>Curland,</HI> as Baron <HI>Blomberg</HI> says, was not totally subdu'd till about the Year 1488, when it was conquer'd by Order of the <HI>Teutonic</HI> Knights, who for some time before had been invited thither by <HI>Volquinus</HI> the II. Master of the <HI>Livonian Order.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Converted to Christia∣nity by de∣grees.</NOTE> The first Efforts to convert <HI>Livonia</HI> to the Christian Faith were made by <HI>Ansgarius</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> and <HI>Suedish</HI> Apostle, as may appear by the Testimony of <HI>Adam</HI> of <HI>Breme,</HI> in his Account of the Northern Nations. After∣wards, towards the end of the XIth Century, a certain Merchant, by Order of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> built a Church there, but which had little Effect till a succeeding King of <HI>Den∣mark, Waldemar</HI> II. founded a Bishoprick in this Country. However Christianity gain'd but little ground in <HI>Livonia,</HI> till near the XIIth Century, about the Year 1180, when</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I <HI>Bishop in</HI> Livonia▪ 1180.</NOTE> <HI>Meinhard de Segeberg</HI> of the City of <HI>Lubec</HI> made further advances therein, and was first ordain'd Bishop of <HI>Livonia</HI> by the Arch-Bi∣shop of <HI>Breme.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I <HI>Absolute Master of</HI> Livonian Order, 1205.</NOTE> The first Master of this <HI>Order</HI> was <HI>Vinno,</HI> who built <HI>Wenda, Segenwald,</HI> and <HI>Ascherod▪</HI> In his time likewise <HI>Waldemar</HI> II.

There goes a Story of the founding of this City, which is this. When King <HI>Waldemar</HI> had resolv'd to build here, he demanded of <HI>Ernemodus</HI> the Bishop which he had appointed over that Diocess, <HI>where he should lay the Foundation?</HI> To which the Bishop repli'd, <HI>If your Majesty please, let it be yonder, where that Boy stands.</HI> Hence it seems the City came to have the Name of <HI>Pilten,</HI> that Word in the Idiom of this Country, as <HI>Pontanus</HI> affirms, signifying a <HI>Boy,</HI> or <HI>Servant.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter sent here∣upon, but with little Effect.</NOTE> Hereupon, at the Instance of the Duke of <HI>Curland</HI>'s Minister, His Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> II. sent a Letter to the <HI>States-General,</HI> to acquaint them with this his Grant, and to re∣commend to their considerations the just Pre∣tentions of the said Duke to this Island; but notwithstanding, the <HI>States</HI> enclining to fa∣vour the <HI>Lambson</HI>'s Interest, who had the Im∣pudence to call this a sham-Grant, affirming,
<PB N="112" REF="185"/>
that his Majesty could not give that which was none of his to dispose of; the said Royal Letter had little or no Effect, till it happen'd that Count <HI>d' Etree</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral took the Island, and made there a miserable slaugh∣ter and Extirpation of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but who thought fit to quit the Possession of it soon after.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>French</HI> beg the Island of their King.</NOTE> Notwithstanding several of the <HI>French</HI> Gen∣try and Merchants having a Prospect of Bene∣fit before their Eyes, afterwards Sollicited their King to Grant the said Conquer'd Island to them, but which he generously refus'd, declaring that it belong'd to a Neutral Prince who did no body any harm.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Letter from K. <HI>Charles.</HI></NOTE> Hereupon, the Duke, without further loss of time, prepar'd to send Ships to take posses∣sion of his Right, and upon his Request King <HI>Charles</HI> was pleas'd to favour him with his second Royal Letter to the Government of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> directed to the then Governor Sir <HI>Jonathan Atkins,</HI> and dated the 19th of <HI>January</HI> 1680, whereby that Governor was ordered not only to permit and suffer the Commanders and Officers of the said Ships to provide and furnish themselves with what they might stand in need of, but likewise to be aiding and assisting to them with his Au∣thority, wherever there should be found oc∣casion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter Intercepted.</NOTE> The like Letter was some time before dis∣patch'd from King <HI>Charles</HI> to the said Govern∣ment by one of the Duke's Ships, call'd the

<HI>Flower-Pot,</HI> but which, together with the Ship was betray'd to the Pyrates of <HI>Algiers</HI> by one Captain <HI>Nagel</HI> the Commander.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke sends Go∣vernours.</NOTE> Upon the Governor of <HI>Berbadoes</HI>'s Receipt of the aforesaid Royal Letter, the Duke was encourag'd to send a Governor to <HI>Tobago,</HI> and soon after several others from time to time to keep possession thereof, till by assistance of the <HI>English</HI> he might be able to establish a Colony there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes a Contract with a Cap∣tain.</NOTE> In 1681 the Duke enter'd into a Contract with Captain <HI>Pointz,</HI> granting 120000 Acres of the said Island to him and Company upon very advantageous terms.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why neces∣sary to be <HI>English</HI> Hands.</NOTE> First, when in the Years 1664, 1665, and 1666 it was in the possession of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they took in the Wars several hundred Sail of Ships belonging to the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> either going or coming from the Plantations, and brought them to <HI>Tobago;</HI> but on the con∣trary, were it in the <HI>English</HI> Hands under the Duke of <HI>Curland,</HI> their Allegiance would prevent for the future the like Damages.</P>
<P>Secondly, in the said Wars both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> made up their Fleets at the said Island, and took and plunder'd St. <HI>Christopher</HI>'s, <HI>Mountserat, Antegoa, Berbudas,</HI> &amp;c. to the great Damage of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="186"/>
Thirdly, King <HI>Charles</HI> was at excessive Charge in fitting out a Fleet to preserve <HI>Me∣vis</HI> from being taken by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the said Wars.</P>
<P>And Fourthly, the said Island being accom∣modated with Harbours and Roads beyond any other of the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> might probably shelter Enemies to the <HI>English</HI> Crown, when if it were in their Hands that inconveniency would be prevented.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobacco whence so call'd.</NOTE> Much more might be added concerning this Island, but for brevity sake it is omitted, only I may take notice, that a <HI>French</HI> Geo∣grapher supposes, that either Tobacco has ta∣ken its Name from this Island, or this Island has been so called from that Weed.</P>
