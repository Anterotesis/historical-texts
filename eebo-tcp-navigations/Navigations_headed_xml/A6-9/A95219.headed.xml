<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I was dispatching the other Letter comming herewith, the same mor∣ning our Scout a-head discovered a Fleet, which in a short time ap∣peared to be the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet come from the <HI>Wellings,</HI> consisting of 97 sail, or there∣abouts, whereof 90 men of War; we made what sail after them we could, which the enemy dis∣cerning, stood away from us, so that it was five a clock in the evening before any of our Frigots could engage them, and neer seven a clock before this Ship came up with them, the greatest part of our Fleet being a stern, so that not above thir∣ty of our ships and frigots came to engage; yet we continued fighting until 9 at night, at which time being dark, we were forced to forbear. The enemy this night got the weather gage of us, by standing to the Northward, when we supposed they had stood to the Southward, as we did; and yesterday being much wind, and durty wea∣ther, nothing was done, both Fleets finding it hard work to get off from a Lee shore, which
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>was the worst to us, being in an enemies Coun∣try; but this morning, being fair weather, and little wind, both Fleets prepared for a second Engagement. To this time the Lord seemed to encourage the enemy, by laying the scales in the ballance, so that neither could tell which had the better, but good was the Lord unto us, who knew when to appear for his own people, though unworthy of so great a mercy; for this day after their great ships from the <HI>Texel</HI> were joined with them, being twenty five in num∣ber, the Engagement began very hot from seven in the morning, and continued till one in the af∣ternoon, the enemy having the weather-gage of us all the while; yet may we truly say, great was the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised, by his appearance on our behalf; for by this time the Lord so daunted their spirits, they now began to stand away from us, with all the sails they could, there being sunk, fired and taken of them, about thirty or fourty sail, so far as we can discern, and are now in pursute of them, some of our Frigots being neer up with some of the sternmost, &amp; am in good hopes that the same mighty presence of the Lord will still follow us, to the disabling, taking or distroying of some more yet. There were nine flagge ships amongst them, when we first engaged this morning, and they have but one left now so far as we can see. At present I am not in a capacity of giving your Lordships a more particular account, our hands and hearts being wholy taken up with the end of the work, and if the Lord will, you may expect
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>(about two dayes hence) to have a further ac∣count thereof. Two of our ships were fired, (as supposed, by the enemy) some others disabled by the loss of their masts, of which I have given the Commissioners a further account, for a present and speedy supply, which I shall not trouble you with; but subscribe my self,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE mine to you yesterday (wherein I gave you an Ac∣count of the goodness of God towards us, and appearance for us in the Engagement with our enemies the day before, and that we were then in pursute of them) there hath little more been done, night drawing on, and the Dutch making directly for the Texell with what sail they could, so that it was not thought fit to be so bold with the shore as they might, not knowing how the wind might take us, many of our Ships being much disabled; but gave order to a small vessell or two to keep sight of them till the mor∣ning, and observe what course they steer∣ed, who returning gave an account that the enemy steered the same night into the Texel harbour, and had boats with lights to shew them the way in, whereupon ye∣sterday
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>at a Councill of War it was resol∣ved, that the whole Fleet should forthwith set sail for Southold Bay there to dispose of such Ships as are disabled, also to send away our wounded men and prisoners, of which a certain account cannot be given at present, but hope to do it very suddenly being now upon it; but I do present your Lordships here enclosed with a gene∣rall Account, referring the condition of the Wives and Families of those who are slain, to your Lordships tender care, wher∣in I doubt not but you will have respect to their necessities.
