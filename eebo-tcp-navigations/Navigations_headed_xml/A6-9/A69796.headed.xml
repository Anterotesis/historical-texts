<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Book having been Published in <HI>Italian</HI> in the Year 1685. by the Inge∣nious <HI>Coronelli,</HI> and the last Year in <HI>French</HI> with Additi∣ons, 'twas thought a Pre∣sent not unacceptable to give our Nation the Translation of it in <HI>English,</HI> which how performed here we leave to
<PB REF="3"/>
thy candid Judgment. The Draughts of the Cities, Towns and Fortifications, having already received suffi∣cient Approbation.</P>
<P>As to the Book it self, we dare promise the Reader Di∣version and Pleasure mixt with Profit, let his Genius be what it will. The Sons of <HI>Mars</HI> will with Warmth and Action read of the glorious Victories, and even envy the glittering Fame of those No∣ble Hero's that sleep in the Bed of Honour. The Poe∣tick Fancy will be diverted with the old Fictions, like sweet Flowers strewed over
<PB REF="3"/>
the whole, and the grave Mythologist with their Mo∣rals. The Antiquary and Historian will find Enter∣tainment in the Melancholy∣pleasing Remains of past State and Glory, that were once the Scenes of the great∣est Performances the Mind of man joyned to active Bodies is capable of, and reflect on the Fate of human Affairs sub∣ject all to Time and Chance. The Naturalist will meet with the Descriptions of the Labours and Sports of Na∣ture, and find some Account of the hitherto puzling Tides of the <HI>Euripus.</HI> Nor will the
<PB REF="4"/>
solid Mathematician lose his Time, but with satisfaction behold the Views of Cities, Plains of Fortifications, and Charts of Shores, Rocks and Seas: But we refer to the Book it self. Farewel.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE MOREA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. <HI>VVherein is shown, That the</HI> Morea <HI>is a</HI> Peninsula; <HI>the different Names by which it has been call∣ed; its Extent and Figure; the Divisions that the Ancients and Moderns have made of the Pro∣vinces contained in it: with a Discourse of its Consines and Frontiers; and at the End, seve∣ral Curious Relations are added upon the same Subject.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF a Land <HI>surrounded</HI> by the Sea, except a small <HI>Isthmus,</HI> that joyns it to the Continent, may be called a <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> or <HI>Penin∣sula,</HI> the <HI>Morea</HI> may justly be so reckon∣ed, since being on all sides environed
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
by the Sea, 'tis at the <HI>North</HI> only joyn∣ed to <HI>Achaia,</HI> by the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Co∣rinth.</HI></P>
<P>This pleasant part of <HI>Greece</HI> has not always had the Name of <HI>Morea,</HI> as 'tis now commonly called; but formerly, <HI>Argos, Apia,</HI> and <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> Its Fi∣gure well enough resembling the Leaf of a <HI>Mulberry,</HI> or <HI>Plane-tree,</HI> gave suffi∣cient ground to the later Emperors of <HI>Constantinople</HI> to entitle it <HI>Morea;</HI> tho' some will not assent to this, but pre∣tend to derive the Name from <HI>Romea,</HI> which by a transposition of the Letters was changed into <HI>Morea,</HI> grounding themselves upon this, That the <HI>Greeks,</HI> while subject to the Empire of <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> and that City was stiled <HI>New Rome</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which Name it kept till <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great.</NOTE>, were themselves also call∣ed <HI>Romei,</HI> as much as to say, <HI>Romans. Doglioni</HI> thinks that it took this Name when invaded by the <HI>Moors. Strabo</HI> insinuates, that it was anciently called <HI>Argo,</HI> or <HI>Argos,</HI> from a famous City of that Name within its Confines; and <HI>Aegialea</HI> from <HI>Aegialus,</HI> a renowned King of the <HI>Sicyonians.</HI> According to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Compend. Hist. Ʋniv. di Nic. Ʋ∣dogl. p.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>Apollodorus,</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> it had the Name of <HI>Apia</HI> from <HI>Apis,</HI> the Third
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
King of the <HI>Argives,</HI> who reigned from about the year of the World's Creation, 2307. to the year 2342. that is 1647. years before the Nativity of Christ. This <HI>Apis</HI> was the Son of <HI>Egialus.</HI> Four hundred and twenty years after, it had the Name of <HI>Pelo∣ponnesus,</HI> from <HI>Pelops,</HI> Son of <HI>Tantalus,</HI> King of <HI>Phrygia</HI> and <HI>Taygeta,</HI> a Man suf∣ficiently famous for his Ivory shoulder, and Incests with his own Daughters. Its bounds (which, as we said, are of the shape of a Plane-tree Leaf), are sixt between the end of the 35. de∣gree, and beginning of the 38. degree of <HI>North</HI> Latitude, and at the Extre∣mities of the degrees 37, and 51. of Longitude, taking the most <HI>West</HI> part of the Isle of <HI>Ferro</HI> for the first <HI>Meri∣dian.</HI></P>
<P>As to its Circumserence, Authors disagree, some making it bigger, o∣thers less. <HI>Isidore</HI> allows its Circuit to be 363. Miles; <HI>Bourdon</HI> extends it to 563. <HI>Porchacchi</HI> adds Ten more, assu∣ring us, that it is 573. Miles round: <HI>Blean, Sagredo,</HI> and <HI>Vianoli,</HI> assign it 600. <HI>Baudrand,</HI> a <HI>Geographer,</HI> of our time, makes it but 550. Miles.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<HI>Strabo</HI> makes its length 1400. <HI>Sta∣dia;</HI> and <HI>Sagredo</HI> agrees with him, ma∣king 170. Miles from the <HI>Isthmus</HI> to <HI>Modon. Baudrand</HI> makes it five Miles longer from the Cape of <HI>Schilli</HI> to the Castle <HI>Tornese,</HI> and takes its breadth, which, according to him, exceeds not 150. Miles between <HI>Corinth</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Matapan.</HI></P>
<P>The most skillful <HI>Geographers</HI> descri∣bing this delicious <HI>Peninsule,</HI> have em∣ployed the greatest accuracy in distin∣guishing those parts from the rest, whereon Nature has been at the great∣est expence for Embellishments, that they might the more advance its Glo∣ry and Reputation. As <HI>Pausanias</HI> re∣ports, it was once divided into five parts, the first containing <HI>Arcadia,</HI> the second <HI>Achaia,</HI> the third <HI>Doria,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and others, divided it into Eight Provinces; <HI>viz. Achaia,</HI> pro∣perly so call'd, <HI>Arcadia, Argos, Corin∣thia, Elis, Laconia, Messenia,</HI> and <HI>Sicyo∣nia,</HI> or <HI>Sicyonis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Achaia</HI> was bounded on the <HI>North</HI> with the Gulf of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> on the <HI>West</HI> with the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea, on the <HI>South</HI> with <HI>Elis</HI> and <HI>Arcadia,</HI> and on the <HI>East</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
with <HI>Sicyonia. Patras</HI> was then its ca∣pital City.</P>
<P><HI>Arcadia</HI> being up in the Countrey, and by consequence distant from the Sea, had for its <HI>Eastern</HI> boundaries <HI>Ar∣gos</HI> and <HI>Laconia,</HI> with the Mountain <HI>O∣ronio; Elis</HI> and Mount <HI>Flora</HI> for the <HI>Western;</HI> on the <HI>North, Achaia</HI> proper, and Mount <HI>Skinfali;</HI> and on the <HI>South, Messenia,</HI> and the Mountain <HI>Taygeta.</HI> Its principal City was <HI>Megalopolis;</HI> that is, the great <HI>Arta</HI> situated at the foot of Mount <HI>Coronio,</HI> called at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime <HI>El Cesal Londari.</HI></P>

<HI>Elis</HI> bordered on the <HI>North</HI> upon <HI>A∣chaia,</HI> properly so called; on the <HI>East</HI> upon <HI>Arcadia,</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> upon <HI>Mes∣senia,</HI> and on the <HI>West</HI> upon the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea. <HI>Polybius</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> name this likewise <HI>Elea</HI> and <HI>Cauconia.</HI> Its prin∣cipal City was also called <HI>Elis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Laconia</HI> had for its <HI>Southern</HI> Limits partly the Gulf of <HI>Colochina,</HI> and partly that of <HI>Coron;</HI> for its <HI>Eastern,</HI> the Gulf of <HI>Napoli di Romania;</HI> for its <HI>Northern, Arcadia;</HI> and for the <HI>Western, Messenia.

<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
At this time <HI>Morri</HI> and <HI>Baudrand</HI> make but four Provinces of it: and this Division is likewise approved of by the Learned <HI>Cautelli,</HI> in his <HI>Geo∣graphy,</HI> received with general Ap∣plause.</P>
<P>The first of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se four Provinces <MILESTONE N="I"/> comprehends the whole Extent of <HI>A∣chaia</HI> proper <HI>Sicyonia,</HI> and <HI>Corinth,</HI> and is called the <HI>Duche</HI> of <HI>Chiarenza.</HI> Its <HI>Northern</HI> bound is the Gulf of <HI>Lepanto;</HI> and on the <HI>South</HI> the Province of <HI>Bel∣vedere.</HI> This Province has several Ci∣ties and Towns. <HI>Patras</HI> is its chief City, after which <HI>Chiarenza, Caminit∣za, Castel-Torneso claim their places:</HI> but we shall reserve their description to the Second Part, where we will give par∣ticular Informations of the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>Its most noted Promontories are the <HI>Cape de Rio,</HI> of which we will speak when we come to treat of the Gulf of <HI>Patras.</HI></P>
<P>Another is the <HI>Cape</HI> by <HI>Bourdon,</HI> call∣ed the <HI>Cape de Chiarenza,</HI> and by <HI>Pto∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emy</HI> and <HI>Strabo, Araxis Promontorium,</HI> which extends it self into the <HI>Ionian</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Sea, not far from the Mouth of the Ri∣ver <HI>Larissus,</HI> between the Gulfs of <HI>Patras</HI> and <HI>Chiarenza.</HI></P>
<P>The last, lying <HI>Southward,</HI> is <HI>Cape Torneso,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> called <HI>Chelonates Promontorium,</HI> Thevet <HI>Cape Thorice,</HI> and Sophianus <HI>Cape Chlumutzi.</HI> This like∣wise stretches it self into the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea, between the Gulf of <HI>Chiarenza</HI> and that of <HI>Arcadia.</HI></P>
<P>The second Province termed <HI>Bel∣vedere,</HI> <MILESTONE N="II"/> reaches where <HI>Elis</HI> and <HI>Messe∣nia</HI> were formerly: It confines <HI>North∣ward</HI> on the River <HI>Carbon,</HI> which also divides it from the Province of <HI>Chia∣renza;</HI> and on the <HI>South</HI> it is bounded by the Gulf of <HI>Coron;</HI> on the <HI>East</HI> it has <HI>Braccio di Maina;</HI> and on the <HI>West</HI> the Gulf of <HI>Arcadia</HI> and <HI>Zonchio.</HI> It contains several Countries and Cities, amongst which <HI>Modon</HI> is the principal, then <HI>Coron, Calamata,</HI> and <HI>Navarin, fol∣low in dignity.</HI></P>
<P>The most celebrated Promontories are <HI>Cape Jardau,</HI> which is the <HI>Ichtus Promontorium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and is the most <HI>Northern</HI> of all.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<HI>Cap de Zonchio,</HI> which <HI>Pausanias</HI> calls <HI>Coryphasium Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cap de Sapienza,</HI> or <HI>Cap Gallo,</HI> by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> named <HI>Acritas Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>The third Province is called <HI>Sacca∣nia,</HI> <MILESTONE N="III"/> or the lesser <HI>Romania,</HI> and contains all the Ancient <HI>Argos.</HI> It has its <HI>North</HI> Confines on the Gulf of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> the Gulf <HI>d' Engia,</HI> and the <HI>Isthmus;</HI> its <HI>South</HI> on <HI>Braccio di Maina,</HI> and the Gulf of <HI>Napoli di Romania;</HI> its <HI>West</HI> in part on the <HI>Duche</HI> of <HI>Chiarenza,</HI> and part on <HI>Traconia. Napoli di Romania</HI> is the capital, the other chief Towns are <HI>Ar∣gos</HI> and <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Palus,</HI> or <HI>Morass</HI> of <HI>Lerna,</HI> where <HI>Hercules</HI> killed the Seven-headed-Hydra, is a place very remarkable in this Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>Though this Monster was but a Fi∣ction, yet it is true, that there were Seven Brethren that lived in this place, and pillaged all Passengers, making the Countrey desolate; against these <HI>Her∣cules</HI> undertook the Combate, and ha∣ving killed the first that encountered him, he dispatch'd the rest two by two, as they came under his hands. Whence
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
the Poets took occasion to feign an <HI>Hy∣dra</HI> with Seven Heads, and its Death from that of the Seven Brethren sacri∣ficed by <HI>Hercules</HI> his Rage to the just Revenge of the Countrey.</P>
<P>This Province has but one Promon∣tory, but that very famous, and known by several Names.

<P>The fourth Province, which has <MILESTONE N="IV"/> changed its Name, <HI>Laconia</HI> for <HI>Zaco∣nia,</HI> is the <HI>Braccio di Maina,</HI> and is at this day indifferently called by those two Names. It much surpasses the bigness of either of the three former, as it is also more extended on the <HI>South</HI> along the Sea-side. It was at first called <HI>Lelegia</HI> from <HI>Lelex,</HI> who first ru∣led there as King. <HI>Virgil,</HI> and other Poets, call it <HI>Oebalia</HI> from <HI>Oebalus,</HI> Lord thereof; and, according to <HI>Stra∣bo,</HI> 'twas likewise termed <HI>Argos.</HI> 'Tis

<HEAD><HI>Of the Mountains of the</HI> Morea.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst the Mountains of this Peninsula is reckoned that of <HI>Foloe,</HI> near which was once situated the City of <HI>Olympia,</HI> so much famed by the Poets for the Country of the Centaurs. The rise of this name was thus, <HI>Hercules</HI> having slain the <HI>Nemaean</HI> Lyon, and being Victorious over the <HI>Lernaean</HI> Hydra, and the Boar of <HI>Ery∣manthus,</HI> happened to go to this Moun∣tain, where he retired into the Cave of the Centaur <HI>Foloeus,</HI> who treated him with a great deal of Civility, and entertained him with excellent Wine which he kept there hid from the rest of the Centaurs; it chanced while they were thus Carousing, some other Centaurs passing by, were drawn by the smell of the Wine, and running to the Den endeavoured to enter by Violence. <HI>Foloeus</HI>'s chief en∣deavour was for an hiding place, so that <HI>Hercules</HI> was left alone to engage with all the Centaurs; he then playd his best, and gave them such terrible
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Effects of his Rage, that having killed some, the rest betook themselves to flight to carry away a wretched Life. The Combat ended, <HI>Foloeus</HI> crept out of his hole, and sufficiently admired the Valour of his Guest; but by mis∣fortune handling the Arrow where∣with <HI>Hercules</HI> killed the <HI>Hydra,</HI> he let one of them fall on his Foot, the wound was so deep that he fell down and dyed on the spot; <HI>Hercules</HI> much grieved at this accident, and in ac∣knowledgement of his kind Entertain∣ment buried him in his own Cave, and named the Mountain from his name <HI>Foloeus.</HI></P>
<P>The other most noted Mountains are <HI>Cyllene, Lyceus, Parthenius, Menalus,</HI> and <HI>Sepia;</HI> of all these <HI>Cyllenius</HI> is the highest, 'tis near that of <HI>Calidoria,</HI> at the Top whereof are yet to be seen the remains of the Temple of <HI>Mercury,</HI> from thence called <HI>Cyllenius;</HI> yet some will have that name to be derived from <HI>Cyllenus</HI> Son of <HI>Aleates.</HI> The Mountain <HI>Lyceus</HI> taking its beginning in <HI>Zaconia,</HI> is memorable for the place where the Tyrant <HI>Aristarchus</HI> was made an offering to the publick Rage of the
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> who there stoned him. It joyns to Mount <HI>Menalus,</HI> which is cover'd with green and shady Groves and pleasant Pasturage for Cattel; a place for the coolness of its Shades, and refreshing briezes of serene Air de∣dicated to the God <HI>Pan,</HI> as Mount <HI>Cyllene,</HI> whose name signifies Maiden, was Sacred to the same Deity. Mount <HI>Sepia</HI> is that where, as <HI>Pausanias</HI> re∣ports, <HI>Epites,</HI> the Son of <HI>Eleates</HI> was stung to death by a Serpent. The <HI>Duché</HI> of <HI>Chiarenza</HI> has on the North the Mountain now called <HI>Poglizi</HI> from <HI>Diana's</HI> Temple which once adorned it; it was at first named <HI>Geronte,</HI> then <HI>Skinfale</HI> from the name of a Nymph, the Daughter of <HI>Arcas,</HI> or from certain large Birds of Prey called <HI>Stymphalides,</HI> that live in these quarters in great flocks: These devoured Men, where∣fore they were either chased away, or the Species quite destroyed by the slaughter <HI>Hercules</HI> made of them.</P>
<P>On the East side between <HI>Saccania</HI> and <HI>Tzaconia</HI> lyes Mount <HI>Cronie</HI> com∣monly called <HI>Grevenos,</HI> on whose far∣thest Northern part stood the Temple of <HI>Lucina</HI> and <HI>Fesipoli,</HI> so named from
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
the Idol to which the <HI>Eleans</HI> offered Sacrifices. Where is found the Stone called a <HI>Cylinder</HI> which may be taken from the Rock, when the thunder rumbling in the Clouds causes an agi∣tation of the Air.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Belvedere</HI> Mount <HI>Mintia</HI> or <HI>Mente</HI> now <HI>Olonos</HI> comes in view; its South has a Prospect of the Gulf of <HI>Coron,</HI> on the North rises the River <HI>Alpheus;</HI> it took its name from <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Mistress, when <HI>Proserpina</HI> Jea∣lous of her Husband, sought after her and found her in this place, and chan∣ged her into the Herb Mint, a great quantity of which grows wild on this Mountain; and in Memory of this Act of the Infernal Goddess, the proud Fanes of <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Proserpina</HI> once stood there.</P>
<P>The little Mount <HI>Neris</HI> lifts it self up in <HI>Saccania</HI> and <HI>Nonacris</HI> in <HI>Tzaconia,</HI> at the foot whereof roul the fatal Waves of <HI>Styx,</HI> fatal to those that taste the otherwise clear and tempting Stream. The Poets make this one of the infernal Rivers; <HI>Inachus</HI> also has its source in this Province. There is like∣wise Mount <HI>Artemisius,</HI> thought to be
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
Mount <HI>Parthenius;</HI> 'twas named <HI>Arte∣misius,</HI> from the abundance of the Herb <HI>Artemis,</HI> wherewith it is covered.</P>
<P>The most considerable and famous of all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Mountains, and that which <HI>Polybius</HI> compares with the <HI>Alpes</HI> is <HI>Taygeta,</HI> bearing another name now of <HI>Orta,</HI> it extends it self in the Province of <HI>Tzaconia</HI> not far from the River <HI>Taenarus,</HI> very near the <HI>Eurotas</HI> that runs by <HI>Misitra;</HI> 'tis stockt with Deer, Bears, Boars and other wild Beasts: It took its name from <HI>Taygeta,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> who be∣ing ravisht by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> out of shame and grief for her lost Virginity, killed her self there. At different times this Mountain has been Sacred to <HI>Bacebus, Ceres, Apolle,</HI> and <HI>Diana;</HI> and in its Entrails are found excellent Whet∣stones.</P>

<P>HAving discoursed of the most re∣markable Mountains of the <HI>Mo∣rea,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
it seems natural to descend from them with the Streams and Rivers that water the lower Grounds of this King∣dom. Amongst these is reckon'd that in the <HI>Duché</HI> of <HI>Chiarenza</HI> commonly called <HI>Carbon,</HI> and by <HI>Sophianus Orsea; Strabo</HI> names it <HI>Alpheus, Ptolemy Alpe∣hius,</HI> others <HI>Strimphalus</HI> and the River <HI>Nyctimus;</HI> into this stream One hun∣dred and forty Torrrents, whose Virtues are so extolled for taking a∣way Tetters or other deformities in the Skin. The Poets have sung a thou∣sand strange things of this River; they would perswade us that its Waves have a peculiar subterraneous Chanel under the Sea, and that passing the <HI>Arcadian</HI> Gulf without mixing with it; beyond the <HI>Strophades</HI> they haste to unite with their beloved Fountain <HI>Arethusa,</HI> which is in the Territory of <HI>Syracuse</HI> a City of <HI>Sicilia:</HI> This River receives several lesser into it, as <HI>Cela∣don, Erimantus</HI> and <HI>Amarinthus:</HI> It's name was derived from <HI>Alpheus. Tebba</HI> after the Death of his Brother <HI>Cercafus,</HI> flying from the sury of the <HI>Arcadians</HI> and despairing of e∣scape, his Enemies being at his Heels,
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>
drownded himself in this River. It formerly had the name of <HI>Strimphelus</HI> from one of the Sons of the God <HI>Mars;</HI> one may well term it the <HI>Antaeus</HI> of Ri∣vers, for after having several times in∣gulfed it self in narrow Passages under the Rocks, it breaks out at last and slides with a serene Majesty within its own Banks.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Eurotas</HI> is also in great Reputation, at this day called <HI>Vassali Potamos: Niger</HI> names it <HI>Iris, Plutarch Hemerus</HI> and <HI>Martathon;</HI> it passes through the middle of <HI>Misitra,</HI> and falls into the Gulf of <HI>Colchina;</HI> it has its source from the same place as the River <HI>Carbon.</HI> The name of <HI>Eurotas,</HI> so celebrated by the Ancients, was gi∣ven to it from <HI>Eurotas</HI> the third King of the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> either, as, <HI>Pau∣sanias</HI> reports, for that this Prince made a new Bank to this River to keep in its Waters, that sometimes u∣sed to overflow the Country to their great damage; or as <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, be∣cause that this King having lost a Bat∣tel he had engaged in before the Full Moon, in scorn of the superstitious Custome of the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> car∣ryed
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
on by the height of Despair, cast himself into this River; which from so Tragical an Event changed the name <HI>Himerus</HI> to <HI>Eurotas.</HI> As for the name <HI>Vassali Potamos,</HI> the Inhabitants say it signifies the <HI>Imperial River,</HI> which name was imposed on it by the Despots of <HI>Morea,</HI> who descended from the Imperial Blood, and for the most part resided at <HI>Misitra,</HI> for the pleasant Diversions of Hunting, &amp;c. on the Banks of <HI>Euretas,</HI> which the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> called the Imperial Ri∣ver in flattery, and to enhanse the Glory of these <HI>Despots</HI> and <HI>Despoenes,</HI> a name given to the Princesses the <HI>De∣spots</HI> Wives. This Stream is still ador∣ned with Silver Swans, which here come in great flocks to sport them∣selves; these are the more admirable for their extraordinary Beauty and Size, besides their extream whiteness; possibly the Poets on this account cal∣led this River <HI>Olorifer,</HI> upon which <HI>Statius</HI> sings,</P>

Poets to <HI>Apollo;</HI> all the Summer it de∣serves not the name of a River, for 'tis so shallow, that it may rather be ta∣ken for a pretty large clear purling Brook; but in Winter encreased by the Rains, it proudly lifts it self up, and sometimes overflows its bounds. It once had on its left the Country of <HI>Ormoas,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> call <HI>Acria.</HI></P>
<P>There is also in <HI>Tzaconia</HI> the River <HI>Inachus,</HI> taking its source from the Mountain <HI>Crovia;</HI> 'tis at this time cal∣led <HI>Planizza,</HI> once <HI>Cramavor,</HI> then <HI>Haliacmon;</HI> in fine, <HI>Inachus,</HI> from the name of a Son of <HI>Occanus</HI> and <HI>Thetis.</HI> The cause thus, <HI>Inachus</HI> not being able to take the Ravishing of his Daughter by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> without repining and murmuring against the deflowring God, in punishment for his Mur∣murs was so tormented by a wild Beast, that he became besotted, and pre∣cipitated himself into this Stream, which took its name from his death.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Inachus</HI> and <HI>Saccania</HI> are seen the Rivers <HI>Linceus, Asteria</HI> or <HI>Stella</HI> and <HI>Erasinus,</HI> which rapidly▪ wash the Foot of Mount <HI>Strimphalus.</HI></P>

it at last met the beginnings and cau∣ses of its future Ruine under <HI>Emanuel</HI> the <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperor: For that Prince, ignorant of that Maxime, That the power of a Monarch is maintained by the Union of the Princes, and that a failure in this brings on the Ruine of Kings and Kingdoms, through a fatal Policy equally divided his Realms a∣mongst his seven Sons; and by that sowed the Seed of discord and in∣testine Broyls, which in the end pro∣duced the intire destruction of that Empire.</P>
<P>The Princes that had the Govern∣ment of this Province were stiled De∣spotes; and though there happened a frequent alteration of Governours, and those of different Extractions, yet the Despotate was still continued in its Prosperity; for the Election de∣pending on the Emperours pleasure, he seldom promoted any to this Emi∣nent Employment but his Brothers or his own Sons, or some other of his Relations, or great Favorites, who by their good Services merited so high a Recompence.</P>

But 'tis a Maxime of the
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
Barbarous Nations, to count nothing inviolable, but the advancement of their Interests by any means whatso∣ever, and take occasion then to make War, when their Enemies think them∣selves most secured by Peace. Thus the Turks never making themselves Slaves to the Religious observance of the Peace, surprised <HI>Argos,</HI> and then behaved themselves as declared Ene∣mies. The Republick found by this first Attempt of the Enemy, that it was full time to provide for their de∣fence; and it being an Enterprize of great Importance, and that from Heaven only we expect the most powerful Aids and an happy Success, it was above all things resolved that the Standards should bear the Ensigns of our Redemption. Then Troops were raised, and the General Com∣mand given to <HI>Bertoldo d' Este:</HI> This great Captain armed with his utmost Courage for so great an Attempt, set sail for the <HI>Morea,</HI> and landed with his whole Army between the Gulfs of <HI>En∣gia</HI> and <HI>Lepanto.</HI> He at first applyed himself to get a perfect knowledg of the place, and to find means of put∣ting
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
a stop to the frequent irruptions of the Enemy; to which end he be∣gan that memorable Work, and in few days finished it, the famous Wall called <HI>Eximile;</HI> after which he em∣ployed his whole Forces in the de∣fence thereof, and in a thousand glo∣rious Actions, gave Proof of his great Courage, and perfect Experi∣ence in the Art of War: Neither his Head nor his Hands were idle, he was the first in all perilous Encounters, undervaluing his Life, so he might Sa∣crifice it to the Service of his Coun∣try, and at the same time forward the loss of his natural and sworn Enemy. He was arrived to the height of his hopes, and his Troops animated by his Example, had already gained several advantages promising a glorious Vi∣ctory, and entire defeat of his Ene∣mies; when God, whose Thoughts are not as our Thoughts are, and who when he pleases can give the greatest Conquerors their defeat, and Death in the Field where they expected to be Crowned with Victory, and ride Tri∣umphant; permitted by the secret or∣ders of his Providence, or Effects of
<PB N="33" REF="22"/>
his Justice upon us, that our Gene∣ral sunk and dyed of several Glorious Wounds. The Head being thus cut off, the Members soon languisht, and the Enemy becoming more sierce through the weak resistance they found, renewed the Combat with greater Fury, and gained the Victory; after which setting no Bounds to their unjust Ambition, they ravaged and became Masters of all the Country, possessed for so many Years by our August Republique.</P>
<P>After which they establish there a Governour of some Quality with the Title of Sangiac, or Morabegi, as much as to say, Lord of the <HI>Morea,</HI> and allowed him an Hundred thou∣sand <HI>Aspers</HI> a year, obliging him to keep a thousand Horse with all ne∣cessary Equipage, to be at the dispo∣sal of the Beglerbey of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>For all the advantages which this <HI>Sangiac</HI> enjoys, yet he is not with∣out his Thorns in his side; for there happen frequent Disputes with the <HI>Dins,</HI> the <HI>Beglerbey</HI> or <HI>Basha</HI> of the Sea, about certain rights he pre∣tends to in all Maritime places, upon

<P><HI>Modon</HI> is the usual place of the <HI>San∣giac</HI>'s Residence<HI>:</HI> the Republick of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> who only to maintain their Rights in this Kingdom, hath ever Valorously been at War with the <HI>Turk,</HI> has been the first that have attempted its Re-conquest: and its Arms had so great Success in the Campagne in 1685. as to be Victorious over almost all the Southern places, reckoning a∣mongst these Conquests the City and Fortress of <HI>Coron,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Cala∣mata, Zarnata, Passava,</HI> and <HI>Chielefa:</HI> besides the frequent in roads made by the Troops up in the Country, that were sent to succour any Fortress that was vigorously attacked; the <HI>Vene∣tian</HI> Army will make this next Cam∣pagne a more advantagious Progress; which we are the more assured of from this hopes, that its Arms are employed only for the great Glory of the Ca∣tholick Religion, and to promote the Ruine of Infidels.</P>

<P>In several Ages this place has been exposed to the Assaults of those who, intending to make themselves Masters of the Realm, have thought of gain∣ing this City and Province; from hence it has happened that the famous Wall built at its entrance, and which for its breadth and solidity makes a considerable Opposition, has been of∣tentimes attacked and gained, and by that means the whole Province sub∣dued, and forced to pay a Tribute to keep themselves in any shew of Com∣mand.

Some time after the <HI>Illyriaus</HI> enter∣taining an Ambitious design of enlarg∣ing their Dominions by conquests, chose them a King, and having got together a very numerous Army, made an irruption into the neighbour∣ing Countrys. When they came near to <HI>Modon,</HI> they gave its Inhabitants to understand with feigned shews of A∣mity, that they desired but to buy the necessary Provisions which they wan∣ted. Those of <HI>Modon</HI> believing the matter to be so without any deceit or trick, took care to provide for them accordingly, some bringing them Bread, others Wine, and others Provi∣sions. When the <HI>Illyrians</HI> saw a great number of them without the Gates, they thought (as it really was) that they were so fool-hardy as to leave but a few to guard the Fortress, so they ran all at once to seize on all the Posts and Avenues, and fell on with their whole Army with that fury, that they put a great many to the Sword, and made the rest their Slaves, making the City a sad Example of their Perfidie and Devastation. The Emperor <HI>Trajan</HI> touch'd with the Misfortune of those

poor People that, escaping from the fury of their Traiterous Enemies, were returned thither, gave them Proofs of his Generosity, granting them several Priviledges and Freedoms. After this manner they lived in a kind of Aristocracy till the time of the Emperour <HI>Constantine,</HI> who left <HI>Rome</HI> for <HI>Constantinople;</HI> yet when subject to the Empire they kept so much of their first immunities, that the same form of Government remained; and as to the Homages paid the Emperor, they were rather protected by him, than entirely subjected to him.</P>

<HI>Bajazet</HI> the Second Emperour of the East, all inflamed with the desire of extending the Bounds of his Empire Anno 1498. marched with a powerful Army strait to <HI>Modon,</HI> which having gained, he turned his Victorious Arms against <HI>Coron,</HI> which he could no otherwise win but by force.</P>
<P>In the Year 1533. the General <HI>Do∣ria,</HI> who had under his command a <HI>Spanish</HI> Armado of 35 great Vessels, and 48 Gallies with a design of envi∣roning this City, caused a great num∣ber of Troops as well <HI>Spaniards</HI> as <HI>Ita∣lians,</HI> the later under two Captains, <HI>Girolamo Tuttavilla</HI> and the Count <HI>Sarno,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Command∣ed by <HI>Girolamo Mendozza.</HI> These three Commanders following the or∣der of their General, began with four∣teen Cannon to batter the City, and to gain Entrance by a large breach; but this Enterprize had not the Success that was hoped for: The Turkish de∣fenders obstinately withstood the At∣tack, and killed 300 Christian Soul∣diers; nevertheless those Forces by Sea performed what the Troops by Land failed in: for vigorously following

the Attack they got the Wall, and ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iged the Defendants to hang out the white Flag; so the Turks were per∣mitted upon Capitulation to go out, Bag and Baggage, and the Troops of <HI>Mendozza</HI> took Possession of the Place: some time after the Turks at∣tempted to form a Blocus, so to regain the Town: it then fell out that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison being unwilling to en∣dure a Siege, shewed a resolution of going out to meet the Enemy, and what opposition soever <HI>Maccian Nova∣rese,</HI> who Commanded in <HI>Mendozza</HI>'s place, made thereto, endeavouring to divert them there from, by putting them to the greatest Labours, yet he found himself constrained at last to yield to their Importunity; wherefore he marched out for that bold Attempt to attack the Enemy, near <HI>Andrusa,</HI> where they lay encamped with an Army of 3000 Foot, amongst which were 500 Janisaries, Commanded by <HI>Casan Aga.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being come near the Enemys Camp, to give them the grea∣ter amazement, thought best to set on fire the Stables of the Horses, who be∣ing

inraged to free themselves from the Flames, made a strange noise, which soon gave the Turks the alarm; who putting themselves in a Posture of defence, and finding the Christian Ar∣my weak and few in number, endea∣voured to encompass it; then was be∣gan a very bloody Combat, and in the midst of the Press the Valiant Captain <HI>Maccian</HI> fell down dead of several Wounds; after that blow the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to sink, and had been utterly routed if one of their Musque∣tiers had not returned to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Commander, the like Fate which their own had suffered; by whose Death the <HI>Turkish</HI> Courage began to cool, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made an Ho∣nourable retreat back to <HI>Coron,</HI> where they took a Resolution to embark and abandon the Place; and so the Em∣peror was willing not to raise new difficulties that might obstruct the making of the Peace in <HI>Hungary:</HI> After this manner that unfortunate City re∣turned under the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Yoak.</P>
<P>In the midst of this Calm, and whilst the Forces of the Republick were not employed about any great
<PB N="67" REF="44"/>
Enterprizes, the Procurator <HI>Francisco Morosini,</HI> Captain General of the Re∣publick, toucht with the Sentiments of Honour and his great Courage, conceived the design of making use of the present opportunity to regain those places in the <HI>Morca,</HI> which the <HI>Ottomans</HI> had ravisht from the <HI>Vene∣tians;</HI> for which purpose, considering that if once they were Masters of <HI>Co∣ron,</HI> which was no difficult matter, a means might be found of carrying on their Conquests; he set sail for this City Anno 1685. and sat down be∣fore it, but scarce had the <HI>Venetians</HI> ap∣proacht the Place, when a great Bo∣dy of Turks came down from the Country, and took up their Lodg∣ments within Pistol-shot of the Chri∣stians; by this bold Act the besieged were animated to a more Vigorous resistance, and it proved a great hin∣drance to the Valour and Designs of the besiegers, who nevertheless de∣sisted not from doing what ever they thought might advance the Siege and promote the taking of the Place. They gave Fire to a Mine of 100 Barrels of Powder, and were prepa∣red
<PB N="89" REF="45"/>
for the Assault, if any Breach should be made, as they hoped there would; and notwithstanding the bad Success of their Mine, they proceed∣ed to advance their Lodgments, and repulse the Turks with an extraordina∣ry impetuosity. In this far advanced Post they defended themselves by their Dragoons, and were reinforced with some Troops of <HI>Malta;</HI> but in the end, after above three hours Combat, they were beat back and routed, and must all there have perisht, had they not found a means of escaping the Pursuit and Sword of the Enemy; yet for all this they carryed off from the Turks Seventeen Colours, and a Trophy of other rich Spoils: Being returned into their Retrenchments, to discourage the besieged, they set up at the end of their Pikes 130 Turks Heads; yet this abated not the Ardour of the Turks, who, although in continual Action, that they had scarce time to breath, yet would entertain no thoughts of Rendition, nor so much as Capitula∣tion, so much were they encouraged by the hopes of receiving a speedy Succour; and indeed a great number
<PB N="69" REF="45"/>
of dispersed Fugitives and others got together from several parts of the Kingdom; or sent from the Turkish Army, came down, so that they were considerably encreased; and then they thought upon the readiest means to procure a speedy deliverance of the place. But their Efforts turned against them, for having attempted to force the Besiegers in their Retrenchments, they were briskly repulsed by a ter∣rible Volley of Musket-shot and Gra∣nado's; and being then pursued by a Regiment, and 200 Dragoons, they left 400 of their Men upon the place, and their Visier <HI>Calil</HI> Bassa was found amongst the rest of the Dead.</P>
<P>After this blow, which was not a little advantagious to us, our General making Reflection, that the Enemies were often refresht with new Supplies, to the great disadvantage of his own Men, whereof he had lost a great number, without any hopes of re∣cruiting them, he at last concluded that the whole Success depended upon the Defeat of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp; where∣fore he applyed himself to whatever might contribute to make this At∣tempt
<PB N="70" REF="46"/>
successful and advantagious, he animated his Troops, took his Mea∣sures, gave Orders and saw them Ex∣ecuted so well, that he not only for∣ced the <HI>Ottomans</HI> from their Camp, but put them to so great a rout, that flying with precipitation, there were a great number of them cut in pieces by our Forces in the pursuit. They left the Christians a considerable Boo∣ty, consisting of six Brass Guns and much other Arms, all sort of Ammu∣nition and Implements of War, 300 Horse, a great many Tents and Co∣lours, amongst which the General-Standard, shewing, by the Horse Tails that adorned it, the Quality of the Commander, who was <HI>Machumat</HI> Bas∣sa, who had the entire Conduct of the Army, and was killed, as we said before.</P>
<P>After so fortunate an Adventure, the <HI>Venetians</HI> found themselves freed from the great Obstacles of the Turks that were encamped without the Place; and being Masters of the Field, they had hopes of soon putting the Besieged out of all thoughts of defence. They prepared for a general Assault,
<PB N="71" REF="46"/>
springing a Mine, whose Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought them to an Attack for three Hours; the besieged withstood them with an incredible Valour and Oppo∣sition, fatal to a great many Nobles and Valiant Souldiers, who perisht there. This considerable loss gave a few moments breathing to the Attack, put the Courage wherewith they a∣gain fell on made the besieged think it high time to come to a Capitulation, as they testified by hanging out a white Standard on the Rampart: Arms then were laid down to regulate the Articles of the Capitulation, but this was only a trick of <HI>Ottoman</HI> Perfidi∣ousness, who made a feigned shew of Rendition, to procure a greater loss to the Besiegers, by a brisk and unex∣pected Assault: The <HI>Venetians</HI> also took a more firm Resolution than ever to put an end to the Siege, which had already continued Nine and forty days, and having swept the Ramparts with their Shot, mounted the Walls and entered the Town, where being heated as they were with the Assault, they made a dreadful slaughter of all the Inhabitants, without regard of

Sex or Age. They found there 128 Pieces of Canon, of which 66 were Brass, besides a great quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ammunition and Victuals.</P>
<P>There happened during the space of so long a Siege several Remarkable matters that would make a great Vo∣lum. I shall but touch at some of the most Considerable, and for those, my design is rather to beget an admirati∣on of the extraordinary Valour there shewn by its Assailants, who were distinguisht either by Birth or their great Employs, and fell there a Sacri∣fice for Glory; than to open our Wounds and renew our Grief for their loss and our Misfortunes: a∣mongst others was the Death of <HI>la Tour,</HI> Commander General by Land, and Knight of <HI>Malta;</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> and of the Prince of <HI>Savoy:</HI> These Illustrious Warriours gave in the face of the Enemy suffi∣cient Proofs of the greatness of their Courage, answerable to the deserved high Thoughts conceived of their Merit.</P>

of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, and we lost but forty of our Men, yet all these losses would not abate the Turkish Pride, and bring them to yield; for they knew where to gather a recruit of fresh Troops, and omitted not daily to disturb the <HI>Venetians</HI> in their Tren∣ches. These frequent Attacks had much lessened our Men, who were besides much harrased with continual Action; so that doubtless 'twas very needful for the General to encourage them, which he did, shewing himself a fearless Example of Valour, being the first in all Dangers and fatigues.</P>
<P>In the end this prudent Comman∣der finding the only means to reduce the place, was to force the Enemys Camp, proposed the Design to the Council of War, which was appro∣ved of by them. He drew out of the Gallies 1500 Voluntiers, who under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Magnani</HI> landed about Mid-night, and next day being the <HI>7th.</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1200 of them filed off to the left of the Enemys Retrenchments by the Entrance of a Valley, and the rest of them went to the right; at the
<PB N="79" REF="55"/>
same time the other Troops had or∣der to follow their Motions, to be ready to give them a speedy Succour at necessary places, so to favour and promote the design.</P>
<P>Twilight of the next Morning be∣ing come, two Barrels of Powder were fired, as a Signal, which was immediately followed with a dis∣charge of all the Cannon, and surious Salvo of all the Musketeers, with a continual siring on the Front and Flank of the Enemies Camp. This brisk and unexpected Assault put the Turks into an extream disorder, and the forwardest of them began to give back and sly, without being able to be retained by the Example of the most fearless, or the Commands of their Officers; all yield, and the <HI>Venetians</HI> find no more resistance, but make a continual Butchery of the Turks, scarce any escaping their Swords. The Event was such, that the Victory which the <HI>Venetians</HI> gain∣ed in a very short time, was accom∣panied with the entire Defeat of their Enemies, and the Ground was all co∣vered with dead and dying Men,
<PB N="80" REF="56"/>
and Streams of the unbelieving Blood ran down; in this Action but few of the Christians were lost or wounded.</P>
<P>A very rich Booty was found in the Turks Camp of Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and Provision, with a∣bove 300 Horses, Tents, Standards, six Brass Guns, three whereof were marked with St. <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> be∣sides these the Imperial Standard a∣dorned with Horse Tails, the mark of a general Command and a nume∣rous Army.</P>
<P>By the order of the Senate this Monument of their Victory was de∣signed for the Church of the <HI>Tolen∣tins</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> to be there for ever exposed to the Eyes of the People, over the Altar of St. <HI>Gaetan,</HI> as an Eternal Memorial that this Saints Festival was the day whereon the <HI>Venetians</HI> had so Glorious a Success against the Infidels; and at the same time it was Decreed that every year on the same day, this Festival should be kept with all the Solemnity pos∣sible, conformable to what was then done. The most Serene Doge, with
<PB N="81" REF="56"/>
the whole Senate and a general Con∣course of all the City, went on <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI> the Twelfth of <HI>September,</HI> car∣rying the Standard with the Tails to that Church, where they sung a <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and a solemn Mass was Cele∣brated in Thanks to God, to the great Comfort and Edification of the People.</P>
<P>The Figure which we have given represents the Magnificence of the Standard, and form of the Batons and Tails; the whole was designed and graved with so much care and exactness, that one who has the Skill of Blazonry, will easily comprehend not only its Grandeur, but likewise the Colours of this Standard; wherefore 'tis needless to particularise it here: It was thought best to oblige the Curi∣ous with the interpretation of the Turkish Characters that make the Moon, and the Faces of the Lance on the end of the Standard.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="57"/>
On the right side of the Standard are read these Words,</P>
<P><HI>In the Name of the most High and Almighty God, God the Lord of all, and of the holy Prophet above all other Saints,</HI> Maho∣met Abubechir, Homer, Osman, Ali.</P>
<P><HI>On the Reverse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is no other God but one only God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet: Our God; thou art the God of Nations; thou art the Soveraign Good and Dispencer of Good.</HI> Kalil Bassa.</P>
<P>On the Face of the Standard are seen these Words repeated,</P>
<P><HI>There is no other God but one only God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet.</HI></P>

The Turks shew these Tails as a sign of their Resolution, to make new Levies, and that a great Army will march; and afterwards they give them to him that is to be the Commander in chief, as a sign of good Augury. This Custom took its rise amongst them, from an Adven∣ture that happened to them, when they first began to establish their Ty∣rannick Rule out of their own Coun∣try. In a Battel their Enemy made 6000 of them Prisoners, who took occasion to throw off the Victors Yoak, and set themselves at Liberty; and wanting Standards to range themselves under, they thought upon, and made use of some Horses Tails for that purpose, since which time they have still continued the Custom; calculating the future by their first Success, and think themselves, under these Colours, able to deal with the most Couragious of their Enemies, and resist their most furious Onsets. But as once when the <HI>Sabins,</HI> a proud and fierce People, planted their Stan∣dard in the Face of the <HI>Romans</HI> to af∣front them, with these words; <HI>Sabinis</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="58"/>
<HI>Populis Quis Resistet;</HI> Who dares resist the <HI>Sabin</HI> People.

<HI>Cornaro</HI> had the Fortune to rout them, and that this Success might procure another of more importance, he cau∣sed some <HI>Venetians</HI> to enter into the Castle, together with the <HI>Turks,</HI> as if they had been all one; those of the Garrison never perceiving the Strata∣gem till it was too late to hinder its sad Effects, so that they thought only upon flight; and thus they became Masters of the place without striking a blow.

<P>Captain General <HI>Morosini</HI> caused a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Twenty fourth of <HI>September</HI> 1685.</NOTE> great Party of <HI>Magnotes</HI> to make an halt before this Fortress, at the same time that the Turks went out of <HI>Chielefa,</HI> to set up the Standard of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> but perceiving the Garri∣son ready to march out, and stayed but to transport the great Guns of the place, he sent a Detachment of five hundred Foot, under the Com∣mand of Sergeant Major <HI>Gregorevick</HI> a Forreigner, to reinforce the <HI>Magno∣tes,</HI> and hinder their design. The Turks discovering at a distance the

<HI>Venetian</HI> Colours, in a great fright and disorder ran and left their Post. So we became Masters of the place without a stroak: It was not judged worth the leaving a Garrison to maintain it; but on the contrary it was resolved to raze it, which was the more readily concluded on, in that it was an useless place, and that there was very near to it a strait passage where a few Men might put a stop to, and engage a very numerous Army.</P>

<HEAD>Mysitra.</HEAD>
<P>AS this place has had several ap∣pellations, so some have chose to call it rather by one than ano∣ther; it was at the first called <HI>Sparta,</HI> then <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> and at last <HI>Mysitra;</HI> it is one of the most fa∣mous of all the <HI>Graecian</HI> Cities, and has been of so vast an extent, that in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Forty eight Sta∣dia make 5440 Geo∣metrick</NOTE> <HI>Polybius</HI>'s time it contained a Circuit of Eight and forty Furlongs. Its Fi∣gure was almost round, and its Situ∣ation
<PB N="94" REF="68"/>
was partly upon an Eminence, and partly upon the declivity of the Hill. The Mountain <HI>Taygeta</HI> com∣mands it on the West.</P>
<P>From that vastness it once had, it is now shrunk to a little Town, scarce∣ly shewing any remains of its for∣mer Glory: Although it had no Walls for Eight hundred Years, yet it maintained it self very well a∣gainst its Enemies, and of those that afterwards incompassed it, though they have been often rebuilt; there is now only the Castle and the Foun∣dations, where they once stood, to be seen. It has but two great Gates, one on the North side towards <HI>Na∣poli di Romania,</HI> the other on the West towards <HI>Exokorion,</HI> to which answer two High-ways or great Roads, one called <HI>Aphetais</HI> or grand <HI>Bazar,</HI> the other <HI>Hellerion.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants are exposed to ex∣cessive heats during the Summer<HI>:</HI> for besides that the City lyes full South, being seated at the Foot of the Moun∣tain, the Suns Rays by this oppositi∣on are reflected and redouble the heat.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="68"/>
The Learned Monsieur <HI>La Guilleti∣ere</HI> being some years ago upon the place, took the height of the Pole three several days one after another, viz. the 19. 20, and 21, of <HI>June,</HI> and regulating himself by the Meridian height of the Sun, by the Shadow of a Cylindrical Body, divided into a thousand equal Parts, the difference of the Shadows at these three Ob∣servations was unperceivable, and the length of the Shadow was still found to be 211 Parts of the Cylinder; whence he concluded the Sun was 12 degrees and 56 Minutes from the Zenith, and the Latitude of <HI>Mysitra</HI> 35 degrees and 26 Minutes.</P>
<P>The City is divided into four Quarters, each of which being sepa∣rated from the rest, makes of it self a disunited Body. The Castle is one of them, the City another, and two Suburbs the other; where∣of the one is called <HI>Melokerion,</HI> that is to say the middle Suburb, and the other is called <HI>Exokorion</HI> or the outward Suburb, by the Turks named likewise <HI>Maratche.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="69"/>
The <HI>Exokorion</HI> is separated from the other three by the River <HI>Vas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li Potamos,</HI> and has no Communicati∣on with them but by a Stone B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge.</P>
<P>The Castle named <HI>to Castron</HI> is seated on an Eminence, is of a conical Figure, and has good Walls; it had some years since Ten Pieces of Artillery, and a Garrison of Eighteen or Twenty Janisaries Com∣manded by a Disdar that seldom re∣sides there.</P>
<P>There are always Magazines well stored with Corn for the Armies use, for each Turkish Family is ob∣liged to bring his Corn in to renew the Store every year. There are al∣so some Cisterns, and in the midst of the Castle a Mosque, once a Christian Church.</P>
<P>This Citadel is so advantagiously situated, that Histories assure us it was never taken, though <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second and the <HI>Venetians</HI> have At∣tacked it with great Vigour.</P>
<P>It was a work of the Despotes in the declining of the <HI>Greek</HI> Empire, and that because the old Castle sea∣ted
<PB N="97" REF="69"/>
on the opposite Hill, whereof now the Ruines are only to be seen, did not sufficiently Command the Town.</P>
<P>It is not certain who was the first Founder of <HI>Sparta,</HI> Historians not yet agreeing thereon: Some say 'twas <HI>Spartus</HI> the Son of King <HI>Amiclas;</HI> others, the Princess, King <HI>Lacedaemon's</HI> Wife, who was called <HI>Sparta;</HI> many affirm 'twas <HI>Cecrops,</HI> who likewise founded <HI>Athens;</HI> and again others attribute its Foundation to <HI>Spartus</HI> the Son of <HI>Phoroneus,</HI> King of <HI>Argos,</HI> Contemporary with <HI>Jacob</HI> the Patriarch, 1763 Years be∣fore the Birth of Christ, since ac∣cording to the Calculation of Fa∣ther <HI>Petau,</HI> the Patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI> was born 1876 Years before the Year of our Redemption, so that to this present Year 1687, there are 3422 Years since the building of this Ci∣ty; therefore it is older than <HI>Rome</HI> 983 Years, than <HI>Carthage</HI> 867, than <HI>Syracusa</HI> 995, than <HI>Alexandria</HI> 1405, than <HI>Lyons</HI> 1639, and than <HI>Marseilles</HI> 1136.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="70"/>
There never was any Nation in the whole World that may be com∣pared to the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> for Poli∣ty, and they never had a King but one of their own People; and these People only have seen upon their Royal Throne two Virtuous and de∣serving Heads circled with the same Diadem; and often amongst them have been sound Prodigies for Wis∣dom and the Art of Governing, that they have been thought the only Politicians; and upon these Foun∣dations 'tis that it could endure and flourish 800 years; it declined in its Prosperity and Glory, when it lost <HI>Colemanes</HI> the third King of that name.</P>
<P>Finally, the Eastern Empire ha∣ving been divided into <HI>Temata</HI> or general Governments, <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> was made an Appendant to the Em∣perors eldest Son; since when it lost its name of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> and was on∣ly called <HI>Sparta;</HI> and its Princes who had under their Dominion the whole <HI>Morea</HI> were called De∣spotes.</P>

<P><PB N="100" REF="71"/>
At last he dying, left the De∣spotate to one of his Nephews of his own name, Son to the Empe∣ror <HI>Emanuel:</HI> this new Despote mar∣ried an <HI>Italian</HI> Lady of the House of <HI>Malatesta,</HI> upon which that Fa∣mily grounds a right to the <HI>Duché</HI> of <HI>Sparta.

<P>In times past the <HI>Graecians</HI> came from all Parts to this little Isle, to adore the God <HI>Aeculapius,</HI> whose Worship made the place famous through the World.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="76"/>
The People of <HI>Epidaurus</HI> when they were once deputed by their Commonalty to this place, as they sailed from <HI>Argos,</HI> which was their Country then, had several Dreams which made them hope for an hap∣py and prosperous Success in their Enterprize; and so being arrived at the Port, they determined there to settle a Colony and build a City, which they called <HI>Epidaurus;</HI> the Buildings are now wholly ruined by tim, that has been no more kind to that place than others, and the name is all that now remains.</P>
<P>It is true that time and chance rules all things, an example where∣of is seen in the Fate of <HI>Malvasia</HI> or <HI>Epidaurus;</HI> for though its situa∣tion ought to render it invincible, yet it has for all that often by ill Fortune undergon several changes of Government.</P>
<P>In the time when it was sub∣ject to the Emperors of <HI>Constan∣tinople</HI> it was taken from them; when the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> having made themselves Masters of that Empire,
<PB N="108" REF="77"/>
and <HI>Baldwin</HI> Count of <HI>Flanders</HI> was Emperor, this place was given in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1204.</NOTE> Fee to a <HI>French</HI> Baron, called <HI>Guil∣laume,</HI> as a recompence for his great Services performed in that War; but at last <HI>Michael Paleologus</HI> having dispossessed the <HI>French,</HI> and being re∣installed in the Empire, he made the said <HI>Guillaume</HI> Prisoner, who at that time made a renunciation of all Right and Title to <HI>Epidaurus;</HI> the Baron being so escaped out of the Emperors hands came to <HI>Venice,</HI> and there made a donation of the same Rights and Pretensions to the Republick, affirming what he had done to <HI>Paleologus</HI> was extorted from him, and upon that account in∣valid, that Act being not volunta∣ry, but forced. So the <HI>Venetians</HI> re∣lying on this donation, set a great Army to Sea, and made them∣selves Masters of <HI>Malvasia,</HI> which they kept till the year 1537. when <HI>Solyman</HI> began to pass the bounds of <HI>Thrace,</HI> to invade the <HI>Graecian</HI> Empire, and endeavour the ruine of Christendom.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="77"/>
The <HI>Venetians</HI> most resented these Usurpations, and the Barbarous Conqueror not contented to have put several parts of their Dominions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1536. <HI>Paruta,</HI> p. 2. l. 9.</NOTE> to pay him Tribute, gave order to <HI>Cassin,</HI> Sangiac of the <HI>Morea,</HI> to lay Siege to and to reduce this People; who getting together a numerous Army began to execute his Orders. When <HI>Solyman</HI> reflecting upon the design, that to Attempt this place were to hazard the Reputation of his Forces and lose time, changed his mind and turned his Arms an∣other way; yet sometime after he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1537.</NOTE> returned thither, and reduced the place not by pure force but by assu∣rances of Peace.</P>
<P>During the Wars of <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> when the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as much as in them lay, opposed the irruptions and violent inundations of the Enemy; General <HI>Foscolo</HI> being near <HI>Epidaurus</HI> with a Squadron of Twenty two Gallies, Eight tall Ships, and six Galeasses, went to At∣tack the Fort which the <HI>Ottomans</HI> had built without the Suburbs.
<PB REF="78"/>
<PB N="110" REF="78"/>
This Attack was very brisk, and the <HI>Venetians</HI> became Masters of the Fort in one day: but it happened as they put the Enemy to flight with loud shouts and crys, that a Mine took Fire under the Victorious, and left an Hundred and fifty of them dead, with as many hurt and wound∣ed. The <HI>Venetians</HI> revenged the Death of their Companions, entring the place with their Swords in their hands, and having demolisht the Fort, they left it, taking away with them Twenty two Cannons, wherewith the Enemies covered and defended the Saicks that came there to An∣chorage in the Port, waiting till a fit time to set sail for <HI>Candia</HI> offe∣red.</P>

<P>AMongst the celebrated Cities, once the glory of <HI>Argia,</HI> at this day called <HI>Saccania</HI> or <HI>Romania Minor,</HI> a very rich Part of the <HI>Morea, Napoli</HI> preserves to this time the re∣mains of its former Beauty; it is named by <HI>Sophianus, Napli,</HI> by the <HI>Greeks</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Spon. Voyage de Grace,</HI> l. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Anaplia,</HI> and by <HI>Ptolomey,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Herod. Xenoph. Strab.</NOTE> <HI>Nauplia;</HI> this strong and trading Town was built by <HI>Nauplius</HI> the Son of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and <HI>Amimone</HI> in the innermost part of the Gulf, com∣monly called <HI>di Napoli,</HI> and by Pto∣lomey <HI>Argolicus Sinus,</HI> on the point of a little Promontory which ex∣tends it self on two sides; that which is towards the Sea makes a large Port and very safe, and the o∣ther is a great hindrance to the Com∣merce of those that pass that way, because they cannot climb up it but by one very steep narrow Path, which lies between mount <HI>Palamedes</HI> and the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="80"/>
The City is situated near to this place, and with very considerable advantages which it has on three sides, puts as it were a Bridle on the Waves of the Sea; whose Shores are so high and steep, that in all ha∣zardous Attempts they absolutely hinder the Enemy not only from landing, but likewise from battering the Walls of the City from their Gallies; the Bay is very spacious within, but it is stopt up at its en∣trance, and no Gallies can get in till they have passed through a Chanel, where they are exposed to the great Artillery. The City is defended by a Citadel well provided, and which being built upon a Shelf or Rock, about 300 Foot out in the Sea, cannot be Attacked on that side toward the Land, and the Rocks that surround it prevent all surprize: In fine, on which side soever one looks upon the Town, one shall find that Nature and Art have conspired as much as possible to render it strong: Nor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Baudrand. Hofman. Laurem∣berg.</NOTE> has it wanted its honourable Titles, for it was once a Bishops Seat, whose
<PB N="114" REF="81"/>
Metropolis was <HI>Corinth;</HI> and at this day it is an Archbishops it self, and one of the Chief. It is distant Fifty five Miles from <HI>Athens;</HI> sixty from <HI>Mysitra;</HI> Thirty six from <HI>Corinth:</HI> It is the Residence of the Governour of the Province, in which are reckon∣ed to be Sixty thousand <HI>Greeks,</HI> besides a great number of other In∣habitants, which according to <HI>Pau∣sanias</HI> were anciently <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> who inhabited there with <HI>Danaus,</HI> as in a Colony of their own. <HI>Napoli</HI> has tasted of the same Fate with o∣ther places, to pass under the Rule of several Princes and forms of Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>As <HI>Paulus Ranusius</HI> reports, it was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paulo Ra∣nusio querra di Const.</HI> 1. 5. p. 160.</NOTE> taken Anno 1205. by the <HI>Venetians</HI> joyned with the <HI>French;</HI> but some time after King <HI>Giovanissa</HI> turning his Arms against this City, though he found it well furnisht with Am∣munition and Men, yet he gave so Vigorous an Assault to it, that he carryed it; where at his entrance he gave terrible Marks of his Rage, for he put the Commander and the
<PB N="115" REF="81"/>
whole Garrison to the Sword, and Sacked the Town, which was at that time rich, powerful, and seated in the best part of the whole <HI>Romania.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verdizzoti</HI> is of Opinion, that in the 13. Century this City being in the Possession of <HI>Marie</HI> of <HI>Erigane,</HI> the Widow of <HI>Peter,</HI> the Son of <HI>Frederic Cornarus Piscopia,</HI> this Lady not finding her self able to oppose so many powerful Enemies, that had a mind to the place, especially <HI>Bajazet</HI> above the rest, made a grant of it to the Republick; under this new Rule <HI>Napoli</HI> quietly let some Ages pass over, yet not without of∣ten tasting those Misfortunes, whereto all places are subject, that are the aim of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> desire; for being several times Attacked by those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> it often proved the Misery of want and Famine, toge∣ther with the eating and tearing Misfortune of seditious Persons, cau∣sed by these frequent allarms.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second greatly thir∣sted to ravish it out of the Arms
<PB N="116" REF="82"/>
of its lawful Prince; and thinking there was no other way to obtain his end, but by Arms, he gave Orders to <HI>Macmut</HI> Bassa, to go and Besiege it with a powerful Army; but this Siege was not Successful; for having found the Defendants very Valiant and able to resist him, armed with a constant resolution to withstand all his violences, he was obliged af∣ter several Attempts and great Los∣ses sustained to quit his Enter∣prize.</P>
<P><HI>Solyman</HI> the most Ambitious of all the Turkish Emperors, commanded <HI>Cassin,</HI> Sangiac of the <HI>Morea,</HI> to go and form a Siege before this place, with proportionable Forces to the strength thereof; but <HI>Cassin</HI> had not herein a more fortunate Success than <HI>Macmut;</HI> for after having obstinate∣ly indeavoured a long time to take the place, and sustained great loss from the Valour of the Inhabitants, he was forced to retire; yet scarce two years past ere he returned to the Attack, and won the place, though in reality it was not by force

which name was at last changed into <HI>Corfu,</HI> as at this time 'tis called. If it cannot be reckoned the greatest Isle of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> yet it may of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea: it was inhabited by Gi∣ants. Its length, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> is ninety four miles; and as <HI>Volteran</HI> will have it, ninety seven <HI>Italian</HI> miles: but this measure does not at all agree with what it is at this day, it being found much less: Possibly they measured with it the Isle of <HI>Paxo;</HI> which as <HI>Paruta</HI> says, was joyned to <HI>Corfu,</HI> and was separated there-from by an Earth-quake for ten miles together; the like to which happ'ned to the Isles of St. <HI>Maura, Cy∣prus</HI> and <HI>Sicily:</HI> At present, from West to East, <HI>Corfu</HI> is but seventy miles, and from the one side to the other, at the West end, twenty miles, and but twelve at the other; in all other places more or less: so that its whole circumfe∣rence is a hundred and twenty miles; it is distant on the East from the Cape of <HI>Otranto</HI> about sixty miles, and from <HI>Venice</HI> 700. On the North, where is the Rock of the Serpent, it abutts upon <HI>Epire</HI> at about a mile's distance; and at the other end towards the East,
<PB N="134" REF="94"/>
at about twenty miles distance. These two Promontories make a <HI>Sinus</HI> or Bay commonly called the <HI>Channel</HI> of <HI>Cor∣fu.</HI> The Isle is situated in the thirty first Degree of North Latitude, and in the forty fourth and forty fifth Degrees of Longitude, placing the first in the West part of the Isle of <HI>Ferro.</HI> Its shape, as we said, resembles a Sickle. Its City is seated in the midst of it up∣on an advanced Promontory. Its Fi∣gure gave occasion to the Poets to feign that the Goddess <HI>Ceres</HI> begged a Sickle of <HI>Vulcan</HI> to give to <HI>Titan,</HI> which having obtained, she hid it in the most inward part of this Isle; but after some time this Sickle being rusted and consumed by the Waves of the Sea, it left its Figure imprinted upon the Land. That which the Interpreter of the <HI>Tienian</HI> History reports is yet more fabulous, which is, that <HI>Saturn,</HI> having cut off the genital Parts of <HI>Coelum,</HI> or rather <HI>Jupiter</HI> having so served <HI>Saturn</HI> with a Sickle, cast them immediately into the Sea, upon which grew those two Mountains whereon were in time founded the two invincible Fortresses of <HI>Corfu;</HI> and that the Action might
<PB N="135" REF="94"/>
be eternallized in the memory of men. The Isle it self had the Form of a Sic∣kle.</P>
<P>This Isle is divided into four Parts, which those of the Place call <HI>Balie.</HI> The first towards the East is named <HI>Lefchi∣mo</HI> by <HI>Marmora, Leuchino</HI> by <HI>Porcac∣chi,</HI> and <HI>Leucimne</HI> by <HI>Thucidides.</HI> The second towards the West is named <HI>La∣ghiro</HI> or <HI>Agiru.</HI> The third <HI>Mezzo.</HI> The fourth <HI>Loros</HI> or <HI>Oros:</HI> Each of these Parts has its Territories. There is spread over all a very pure clear Air, and exceeding wholesome, as may be gathered from the Forests of Oranges and Cedars that there flourish: And with some reason the Poets sung so much of the Gardens of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> who dwelt in this Isle. The Country is al∣so very fruitful in all kinds of Grain, and Honey, and Wax, with Wine and Oyl of an extraordinary goodness; nor does it want pleasant Flats in its Northern Parts.</P>
<P>In the first Territory of <HI>Lefchimo,</HI> where yet remains some Tracts of the Ancient and Episcopal City of <HI>Gardi∣chi;</HI> at two miles distance from the Sea of <HI>Garbino</HI> there is a Fountain
<PB N="136" REF="95"/>
which made it famous, which after making a small River, runs down to the Sea; on which Stream are several Mills. This Territory contains about ten thousand Inhabitants in twenty five Burroughs, the biggest whereof is named <HI>Potamos</HI> from a Canal that di∣vides it in two. It is inhabited by very civil and gentile People. From thence is a Canal for Vessels down to the Sea.</P>
<P>The Territory of <HI>Laghiro</HI> or <HI>Agiru</HI> on the East of the Isle abounds in all sorts of necessaries. It has eight thousand Inhabitants in twenty Villages. It had had more if the <HI>Africans</HI> had not come and demolished a City built in a <HI>Penin∣sule,</HI> where at present stands a Mona∣stery with a good number of Religi∣ous, whose Church is dedicated to the Holy Virgin, and is called <HI>Palio Castri∣za.</HI> The Castle called <HI>Angelo Castron,</HI> built by the Emperour <HI>Michael Comne∣nes</HI> upon the Promontory <HI>Palachrum,</HI> is at this time named St. <HI>Angelo.</HI></P>
<P>The third Territory called <HI>Mezzo,</HI> in which stands the City of <HI>Corfu,</HI> had once a larger City. In an extent of six∣ty miles Possession there are thirty Ca∣stles or Lordships and Villages, which
<PB N="137" REF="95"/>
together with the Capital contain twen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y five thousand Persons.</P>
<P>The fourth Territory called <HI>Loros</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>Oros</HI> in forty five miles Country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wenty five Towns, has about eight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>housand Inhabitants. <HI>Cassiopa</HI> now <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assiopo,</HI> a very famous City was ancient∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y its Capital. The whole Isle has pro∣perly no Rivers; for though on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide of <HI>Garbinio</HI> there seems to be one which they name <HI>Mesongi,</HI> that takes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts source near the Fortress <HI>Cardicchi,</HI> yet it ought rather, as well as all the rest, to be reckoned a Brook than a River.</P>
<P>Historians agree not as to the Origi∣nal of the Inhabitants of this Isle, as may be seen in the History of <HI>Corfu,</HI> writ by <HI>Marmora:</HI> yet all or most of the People at this day are <HI>Greeks,</HI> and observe the Rites of the Greek Church.</P>
<P>One Historian observes, that this Isle was once of a considerable force <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eustachio Sopra Di∣onigi.</NOTE> by Sea, and that, in the time of the War between the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> it put thirty armed Galleys to Sea. The Greek are not the only Historians that make honourable mention of this
<PB N="138" REF="96"/>
Isle; for besides what <HI>Thucidides</HI> say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it, speaking of the Wars of the <HI>Moreae,</HI> in which the <HI>Corcyreans</HI> had of∣ten their part, we find that <HI>Titus Livi∣us</HI> makes them to receive Orders in the Army of Q. <HI>Fulvius Flavus,</HI> to guard the Coast of <HI>Calabria,</HI> and that they went in pursuit of the Ambassadors of <HI>Carthage,</HI> who at the sollicitation of <HI>Hannibal</HI> were sent to make a League with <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Macedon;</HI> and that these Ambassadors having been brought before the Captain General, he se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The People of this Isle after having been long subject to the Kings of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> weary at last of being still subject to the frequent Commotions of that Kingdom, offered to put themselves under the Obedience of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Republick. This their Design they communicated to <HI>Giov. Penelasco,</HI> then residing at <HI>Corfu</HI> in quality of Consul for the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who gave advice thereof to the Senate: and because the Prince of <HI>Tarentum</HI> made some pre∣tences, they sent to him the Secretary <HI>Pietro Compitelli</HI> or <HI>Campitelli,</HI> to shew him the danger that would ensue, if
<PB N="139" REF="96"/>
the Isle should fall into the Enemies hands, and so with a good sum of mo∣ney they found means to satisfie that Prince.</P>
<P>As <HI>Porcacchi</HI> reports, the Isle be∣came subject to the Republick in the Year 1322. though <HI>Giov. Miani,</HI> Cap∣tain of the Gulf, did not take the Pos∣session thereof from the hands of <HI>Riccar∣do Altavilla</HI> and <HI>Giov. Alessio Cavalila,</HI> till the ninth of <HI>June,</HI> 1327. yet <HI>Mar∣mora</HI> assures that Possession was taken on the twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> 1386. which last Author pretends he had it from the authentick <HI>Archives.</HI> This whole Affair was managed and transacted by a Religious of the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> called <HI>Padre Maestro Giulio Vanello,</HI> a man of good parts and much esteemed. He so brought the business about, that he assembled the chief men of the place in the Church of the Convent, then called St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> and there caused the Keys of the Gates to be delivered into the hands of Captain <HI>Miani,</HI> with a grant of the Authority over the Ci∣ty. The Representants of the Re∣publick come every Year on the same day into this Church, accompanied
<PB N="140" REF="97"/>
with the Body of the Officers, before whom the <HI>Protopapa</HI> renews the memo∣ry of this Action. I might add that the Prince has assigned to this Church, as a Mark of his acknowledgment to the Order, two Ducats, yearly to be taken out of the Fiscale Chamber of <HI>Corfu.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> were after this manner possessed of it, till the Year 1401. when <HI>Ladislaus</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Son of <HI>Charles,</HI> for thirty thousand Ducats left it quite free to the Republick.</P>
<P>It has been still maintained under the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government, who have guard∣ed and defended it, as a place very ne∣cessary for the conservation of their Empire by Sea; for it has several very good Ports where the Navy may re∣fresh it self commodiously; besides it has a convenient Situation for the De∣fence of the other Isles and States of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and can hinder a great Ar∣my from entring the Gulf, who will hardly venture to pass by and leave so powerful an Enemy behind in so ad∣vantageous a Post. Wherefore 'tis well named the Gate of the Gulf and the Rampart of <HI>Italy</HI> against the barba∣rous.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="97"/>
In these last Ages that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces are much increased, the Repub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick has, for the common benefit of <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI> been at great expences in Works and Fortifications in this Isle, to make the Fortress impregnable: Wherein they have hitherto succeeded. On the middle of the Circle of the Isle, there raises it self up a solid Rock, on which is built the old Fortress, encom∣passed on all sides with the Sea, ex∣cept on that part which faces the Land, where 'tis Flanked with two Bulwarks, with their Curtain, and a good Ditch cut from one side of the Sea to the o∣ther. Under this Fortress is situated the City, joyning to which stands the new Fortress raised on the Mount of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> with infinite charge to front <HI>Mount Abram,</HI> that lies over against it, and which for some time has been much levelled.</P>
<P>The City glories in the birth of <HI>Aene∣as,</HI> and has now the Title of an Arch-bi∣shoprick. The Republick sends thi∣ther six Nobles, who remain in their Government two years. The first has the Title of a Bail; the second of a Pro∣veditor; the third of a Captain, who
<PB N="142" REF="98"/>
with the fourth are the Councillor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> One dwells in the Cittadel of the ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fortress, the other in the City; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fifth is the Grand Captain, and has the new Fortress for his Lodgement, and the sixth is Lord <HI>Castellain</HI> of the Caste called <HI>Della Campana,</HI> in the old Tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>In the year 1537. <HI>Barbarossa</HI> shewed himself before <HI>Della Campana,</HI> with an Army of five and twenty thousand <HI>Turks,</HI> which he commanded by the order of <HI>Solyman.</HI> They had thirty great Guns, with which they planted a Bat∣tery against the place, but by reason of the great distance they were at, their Bullets were not able to make a breach in the Walls. But the Artillery of the great Fortress made terrible Distructi∣on in the Army and Fleet of the <HI>Turks;</HI> five of their Galleys went to the bot∣tom, and even that of <HI>Barbarossa</HI> was not out of the Cannons reach. Du∣ring thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Siege, the Republick sent an extraordinary Ambassadour to <HI>Rome,</HI> to represent to the Pope, and by him to the Emperour, of what consequence the loss of <HI>Corfu</HI> would be to the King∣dom of <HI>Naples,</HI> to <HI>Sicilia</HI> and all <HI>Italy.</HI> He endeavoured all he could in this Em∣bassage,
<PB N="143" REF="98"/>
that the Emperour would send Fifty Galleys with Fifty other Ships as he had done once before against the <HI>Turks,</HI> to joyn with 100 Galleys and the Galleasses, and three Gallions and a good number of other Vessels that the Republick had then in the Sea.</P>
<P>At first the Pope applyed himself to this affair, to procure so great a benefit to <HI>Christendom;</HI> but his endeavours were unsuccessful; so that the Repub∣lick were left alone to withstand the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and they obliged them shame∣fully to raise the Siege: And thus that important place, <HI>Corfu,</HI> was delivered.</P>

<P>This Isle has the <HI>Morea</HI> on the East at 80 miles Distance, on the West it borders on the Isle of <HI>Cephalonia,</HI> from whence tis 12 miles, on the South is the Coast of <HI>Barbary</HI> 150 miles off, and on the North it has another Part of the <HI>Morea</HI> about <HI>Castel Tornese</HI> at 16 miles Distance, and a little lower it looks towards the Country <HI>del Dichiamo,</HI> where are <HI>Natolico,</HI> the <HI>Curzolares,</HI> and <HI>Drago Mestre,</HI> Places at above 50 miles distance.</P>
<P>The whole Isle is divided into three Parts, called <HI>Montagna, Pedimonte,</HI> and <HI>Pianura. Montagna</HI> begins on the East side, where lies Port <HI>Chieri,</HI> and makes the Circuit of the whole South and West side of the Isle even quite to the North, having in its middle a very

beautiful plain called <HI>Neruli,</HI> in the mid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whereof was a great Lake of water<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Hills, till the Noble <HI>Angelo Bar∣barigo</HI> took the pains and care to drei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it. At this time 'tis a fair and fruitful plain 10 miles long and five broad, and borders on two sides upon the Sea shore. Here stands the City <HI>Chieri</HI> giving name to the Port: from the waters of which comes the black Pitch, and there is an opinion among the Inhabitants that the Lake was anciently all of this Pitch. There are besides seen here the Towns called <HI>Littachio, Pigadachita, Sculicado</HI> with fourteen more, whose names for brevity I omit. On that part called <HI>Montagna</HI> are <HI>Ambelo, Chilomeno, Agelo, San Leo, Santa Maria,</HI> and other Towns to the number of nine. The farthest of them is called <HI>Volimes,</HI> lying towards the West. It contains above one thousand houses.</P>
<P>There are besides in this part three Monasteries of Greek <HI>Caloieros</HI> called <HI>San Giovanni in Lancada, La Madonna Spiliotissa</HI> or <HI>Anafontria,</HI> and <HI>San Geor∣gio di Grebani,</HI> which is the most consi∣derable and commodious for situation.</P>
<P>In that Part called <HI>Pianura,</HI> which is
<PB N="165" REF="116"/>
on the North of the Isle, are the Towns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Gaetani, Curculidi, San Quirico, Farao</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>San Dimetrio.</HI> Besides the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oted Mountain making a principal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of the Isle, there are two others which encompass the Isle, one on the East, the other on the North: On the first stand two Towns called <HI>Xerocastello,</HI> and <HI>Lambetti;</HI> on the other are four, <HI>Geracario, Bellusi, Calenzi,</HI> and <HI>Tragacchi.</HI> In the whole Isle there is but one River named the <HI>Camura,</HI> whose waters are brackish, being mixt with the waters of the Sea; but there is below the Castle, not far from the Sea, a source of fresh water, with all the qualifications of an excellent spring: It is at all times so plen∣tiful, that all the Ships that pass for <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as well going as coming, take fresh water there.</P>
<P>On the North, the Isle is all precepi∣tious and steep, and on the South covered with all sorts of fruit-trees. On the Greek shore is built a Castle on an Emi∣nence which commands the whole Isle; where reside the Rector and the Gover∣nour. At the foot whereof lies the Town which stretches it self for two miles along the shore, and one mile in
<PB N="166" REF="117"/>
breadth towards the Mountain. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are in this Town a great many houses which belong to the Citizens, Mer¦chants, <HI>Artizans,</HI> or Mariners. They cure great Quantities of Raisins there and make very strong wines, and ex∣cellent oyl, which one year with ano∣ther yields them the sum of fifty thou∣sand Ducats. There is also abundance of as delicious fruits and rare Plants, as in any other place. Its Port is like∣wise called <HI>Chieri,</HI> of good anchorage for all sorts of Vessels, Ships or Gal∣leys.</P>
<P>On the North side is <HI>Cape Schinan</HI> and the Rock called <HI>San Nicolo,</HI> where nei∣ther great nor small Vessel can enter, except on the East side; the shallowness of the water and the want of a good bottom hindering that on the West. On the East is the Valley of the salt-Pits where Ships come to take in their Lading of Salt. A little nearer to the City is the Rock called <HI>fra Filippo,</HI> at pre∣sent <HI>Trenta Nova;</HI> and a little farther is the point <HI>Laugun</HI> very near to the Town.</P>
<P>It is believed that Saint <HI>Veronica</HI> came to plant the Christian Faith in this Isle,
<PB N="167" REF="117"/>
and that she converted the Inhabitants by showing them the Holy Handker∣chief, and thence preaching to them the Death and Passion of our Saviour.</P>
<P>The Republick sends thither a No∣ble Man with the Quality of Proveditor, and two others for his Councellors, who all keep their charge two years. But the Inhabitants hold their Councils a∣part where they regulate Provisions, health, and other matters that concern the Policy of the City. They have power also in civil causes to give Judg∣ment under a certain Sum, and there lies an appeal from them to the Pro∣veditor.</P>
<P>The most part of the Inhabitants are <HI>Greeks</HI> and live according to their rites; and there are but few <HI>Latins,</HI> com∣prehending amongst them even the Souldiery. There are about a thou∣sand Jews who have three Synagogues. Their business is trade, and they grow very rich all of them.</P>
<P>The People of this place are more inclined to Arms than Learning but of the few that apply themselves to the Sciences, the brightness of that Elo∣quence shines forth, which is so natural

<P>The Isle is subject to Earthquak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which destroies what ever is good and beautiful. Some years since they felt in one night sixty shakes, which were preceeded by a terrible noise: This noise usually lasts half a quarter of an hour, and is communicated to the Rocks, that are standing out of the Earth: and sometimes there happens an infectious stink. When the Earthquake is very great it raises an exceeding boisterous wind, upon which score their buildings are but low and of few Stories.</P>
<P>There is a Bishop that makes his Residence in the Isle with the Title of Bishop of <HI>Zant,</HI> conferred on him by the Holy See: yet by the patents from the Senate of <HI>Venice,</HI> he is entitled the Bi∣shop
<PB N="169" REF="118"/>
of <HI>Cephalonia.</HI> At first this Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cknowledged the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch time as the Church of <HI>Constantino∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</HI> had a Patriarch of her own; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen the Patriarch, strengthened by the favour of the Emperour, caused several of the Greek Churches, and some of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>talian to submit to his See.</P>
<P>At the time, when several of the Western Princes associated themselves to war upon those that possessed the Holy Land, the Church of <HI>Zant</HI> returned to the obedience of the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> Se∣veral very noted persons have flourisht there, by reason of the great Revenues of the Bishoprick, which has amounted, as is seen in the Archives, to more than six thousand Crowns. Possibly the Bishops had then the force of the Laws and se∣cular Arm, more than the Authority of their See and zeal of their preaching, to assist them. Two Bishops of this Church successively went to the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> where they were much distin∣guisht by their merit.</P>
<P>The first was <HI>John Francis Comendon,</HI> who died during the time of the Coun∣cil, who was succeeded by <HI>Petro Delfi∣no,</HI> a Noble <HI>Venetian.</HI> The Parish
<PB N="170" REF="119"/>
Churches of the <HI>Greeks</HI> comprehending those of the City, the Cittadel, and o∣thers that have been founded out of de∣votion are about forty four. There are likewise a great number in <HI>Cephalo∣nia</HI> that place being well Peopled. There are fifteen in the City, in each of which is a plain Altar, with the Altar∣piece towards the East, adorned with paintings after the Greek fashion, who permit no Images <HI>in Relievo,</HI> in their Temples. The Altar is of stone inclo∣sed with a Rail, whose entrance is for∣bidden to Laicks and Women. Nay the Women presently after Child-bed, and the Men that are found in any ill action, are forbid the Churches; but this custom is now neglected.</P>
<P>When the Arch-bishop happens to die all the Greek Curates, of which there is a good number, assemble them∣selves; and according to a very ancient custom, authorized by the Holy See, they give their suffrages in secret, to proceed to the election of another. The Bishop has no fixt Revenue and maintains himself upon Casualties, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> yearly present to him as in a Quantity of Wheat and other
<PB N="171" REF="119"/>
Grain: He likewise has a considerable gain by Ordinations; and by one way or other his Revenue is very large.</P>
<P>As a Qualification of a Bishop of this City, a man must have been a Monk of the Order of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> upon which ac∣count there are so many Monasteries of that Saint's in these Isles. The most con∣siderable of which is built on the Rocks commonly called the <HI>Strophades;</HI> of which in their place. This Monastery has several Revenues in <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Cepha∣lonia;</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> have these Monks in Great Veneration, because they live very retired from secular affairs.</P>
<P>These Monks of St. <HI>Basil</HI> fast the whole year, except in case of infirmity or sickness, when they may have a dis∣pensation for three days in the week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday they eat nothing but milk, fish and oyl. They keep four Lents in the year; the first is that of <HI>Easter</HI> called, <HI>i Megali Tessara-costi;</HI> which lasts seven weeks; for which time they are not permitted to eat either fish or oyl, except two days in the week, viz. <HI>Saturday</HI> and <HI>Sunday,</HI> nor that, on Holy <HI>Saturday.</HI> Their nourish∣ment then is only fish that have no blood,
<PB N="172" REF="120"/>
as oysters, dryed fish, <HI>Caveer,</HI> which is the Rows of fish salted; <HI>Botargo,</HI> which is made of the Row of a Sturgeon dryed and salted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are two other days on which they may eat, that is the 25 of <HI>March,</HI> being Annunciation-day, which they call <HI>Euangelismos,</HI> provided it happen before the Holy week; the o∣ther is Palm-Sunday, which they name <HI>Tou Vaghiou.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Lent, is of the <HI>Agioi Apo∣stoloi,</HI> in honour of the Holy Apostles, which lasts from the <HI>Munday</HI> sevennight after <HI>Whitsuntide,</HI> till the Vigil of St. <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> and <HI>Paul;</HI> so that some years it lasts three weeks, others more.</P>
<P>The Third is called <HI>Tis agias Parthe∣nou,</HI> dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which lasts from the first to the fifteenth of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI> in which time they eat no fish ex∣cept on the sixth, being the feast of the Transfiguration of Christ, which they observe with Solemnity, and call it <HI>Me∣tamorphosis tou Sotiros.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth is called <HI>ton Christogenon,</HI> which begins forty days before <HI>Christ∣mass,</HI> to wit on the fifteenth of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> and continues till the twenty fifth of <HI>December,</HI> for which time they may eat fish except on <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Fridays.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="120"/>
The <HI>Caloieros,</HI> besides these four, ob∣serve three other Fasts; the first before St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> which lasts twenty days; the second begins on the first of <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> fourteen days before the Exaltation of the Holy Cross; the third eight days before the feast of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> Be∣side these all the <HI>Greeks</HI> in general fast on <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> and several of the most zealous on <HI>Mondays</HI> also. Moreover on the day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and the Decolla∣tion of St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> they keep a more severe Fast. Except these times they eat flesh all the week after <HI>Easter-Sunday,</HI> and that whole week after <HI>Whit-sunday,</HI> and for twelve days together after <HI>Christmass,</HI> and a week before the great Lent. They keep likewise three other Vigils in the year, That of the <HI>E∣piphany,</HI> which they name <HI>Paramoni,</HI> on which day the <HI>Greeks</HI> baptize the Sea with a great Ceremony; the second is the Vi∣gil of St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> and the third that of the Cross whereon they are for∣bid to eat fish. Thus those <HI>Greeks,</HI> that are not Monks, fast about a hundred and thirty days in the year.</P>
<P>All the Monasteries of the Religious, observe
<PB N="174" REF="121"/>
the Rites of the Greek Church, and if there should be one amongst them of the Latin Church; yet they must observe the Greek Rites. It is permit∣ted to these Religious, on divers occasi∣ons, to visit their sick Relations; and to go about the Cities, living with∣out any Cloyster; which doubtless is contrary to the Institution of a Mona∣stick Life.</P>
<P>There is not in these Isles any kind of Hospital for the Poor. Except only in <HI>Zant</HI> there are two little poor Alms∣houses, one for the Men and ano∣ther for the Women, under the dire∣ction of the Citizens of the Place: They used to receive into these houses Found∣lings and Bastards; but that custom is now left off. There are also, in these Isles, many Protestants, most of them English. There are four Convents, one of Preaching Friars, two of Friars Minors Conventuals, one in <HI>Zant,</HI> the other in <HI>Cephalonia;</HI> and one of Minors Observants in <HI>Zant,</HI> without reckon∣ing the Parish Church of <HI>Argostoli,</HI> which is a <HI>jus patronale</HI> of the most Serene Re∣publick; which it has bestowed on the Minor Observants.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="121"/>
These People live willingly under the obedience of the Republick, which watches continually for their defence against the powerful irruptions of the <HI>Turks:</HI> And besides for that they per∣mit them to live conformable to their own Rites, of which they are so zealous, being perswaded of their ancient and pure Institution.</P>
<P>There grows in this Isle very extra∣ordinary Fruit; and that in as great a∣bundance as any Isle thereabouts.</P>

They are low, almost level with the water; their Port is distant from <HI>Zant</HI> above fifty miles; they are but of small extent, the bigest not above three or four miles in circuit. And tho they are so small, they produce a Prodigious quantity of Grapes; and the wine of them is extraordinary good. There are also many fresh Springs, all along which are found a great deal of Planc-Tree leaves; tho the nearest place, where any of those Trees grow, is in the <HI>Morea,</HI> at thirty miles distance; where∣fore doubtless they must be brought thither by subterranean passages.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are all Greek <HI>Caloieros,</HI> who for their defence against the <HI>Turk,</HI> have built their Convent in form of a Fortress, well provided with Cannon, with a Port-cullis at the Gate.</P>
<P>The Poets feigned that <HI>Aello, Ocypite,</HI> and <HI>Celaeno,</HI> born of <HI>Thaumas</HI> and <HI>Teletra,</HI> inhabited the infernal Pit in the shape of <HI>Harpies,</HI> whence they went to tor∣ment wicked men at the command of the Gods: And they paint us these <HI>Har∣pies</HI> with lean, tho beautiful faces like Women; the rest of their bodies being like horrible Vultures, with large wings

and pointed talons. The Fable adds, that <HI>Phineus</HI> King of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> like an in∣humane Father, having pluckt out his own Childrens Eyes, the Gods return∣ed the same punishment upon him, by tearing out his, and leaving him to the terrible pursuit of the <HI>Harpies,</HI> which defiled his food with their ordure and stink. <HI>Jason</HI> touched with compassion for the miserable King, and willing to relieve him, caused <HI>Zetes</HI> and <HI>Calais</HI> to drive these Monsters from tormenting him and force them to retire into the <HI>Strophades.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The Isle of</HI> Cerigo.</HEAD>
<P>ON the West of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> lies the Isle at this day commonly called <HI>Cerigo. Ptolemy</HI> named it <HI>Cythera</HI> from <HI>Cy∣theron,</HI> the Son of <HI>Phenicus; Aristotle</HI> calls it <HI>Porphyrusa,</HI> from the great store of <HI>Porphyry</HI> dug out of its Mountains; and others again <HI>Scothera.</HI> 'Tis just against the <HI>Laconian</HI> Gulf, but five miles off the <HI>Mo∣rea,</HI> forty from <HI>Candia,</HI> and has sixty in circumference. It has several Rocks roundabout it, and good Ports on its sides. On the South is the Port of the Fortress, which is but little frequented, because 'tis but a narrow Bay, and lies much ex∣posed to the winds: The other, which is on the other side the <HI>Dragoniers,</HI> twelve miles from the Fortress, has a good bot∣tom, is deep, and will contain a great Fleet: Above all things the natural shape of the Bay is wonderful, which may be shut up, and where forty Galleys may lie in safety. There is a Church dedica∣ted to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> though no body dwells there. On the West at 25 miles distance from this Port, there is another little one called <HI>San Nicolo de modari,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="126"/>
proper for <HI>Galliots</HI> and small Barks, where is also a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>There is in this Isle great quantities of wild fowl, but little corn, wine or oyl; and food is there very dear. There are several Villages, but of small or no account: And some Monasteries of <HI>Hie∣romonachi</HI> and <HI>Caloierros,</HI> of which one stands upon a Rock on the right side near to the Fortress, which they call <HI>San Giovanni della Grotta.</HI> It has been hewn out of the Rock by pure labour with the mattock. Tho 'tis very diffi∣cult to get up to it; yet the <HI>Greeks</HI> re∣fuse not that pains, when-ever the Re∣ligious are to perform their Vows, which they have made to God. The steep points of the Rock, affright all that look on them, for they hang over so, that they threaten to fall and over∣whelm those that approach them. But for all this the Inhabitants have a great Veneration for the place, upon a belief, that St. <HI>John</HI> began his <HI>Apocalypse</HI> there.</P>
<P>The City of the same name with the Isle has the Title of a Bishoprick: It stands upon a steep Rock in a very ad∣vantageous situation, having towards the Sea an Esplanade well mounted
<PB N="181" REF="126"/>
with Canon, where they keep Guard.</P>
<P>The Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> has had the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some say ever since the De∣spots of <HI>Greece.</HI></NOTE> Command of it ever since the division of the Empire of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and sends thither, every two years, one of her Noble Men, in Quality of <HI>Chastelain,</HI> and Proveditor. <HI>Selim</HI> attempted with a powerful Army, commanded by <HI>Hali</HI> and <HI>Portau</HI> to conquer it, but he soon gave it over, finding his endeavours but vain.</P>
<P>Some fabulous Writers say, that the Goddess <HI>Venus</HI> had her Birth in this place, others that she passed her first days there. And was there ac∣knowledged for a Goddess, and there was a beautiful Temple dedicated to her; under the name of <HI>Cytherea</HI> in the most Eastern part thereof: In which Temple was her Statue like a beautiful Woman holding in her right hand a Sea shell, and as if ready to leap into the Sea. She was all dressed with blushing Roses and snowy Pidgeons flying around her, which seemed to follow and attend her motion. Three young Virgins, re∣presenting the three Graces, hand in hand, went round her to serve her; two whereof were in action, as if they were
<PB N="182" REF="127"/>
adorning her head, the third waited on her behind. Her Son <HI>Cupid</HI> was before her, armed with his bow, who, tho blind, yet wounded the God of Light, <HI>Apollo,</HI> with an Arrow from his bow.</P>
<P>'Twas in this Temple, that <HI>Paris,</HI> the amourous Son of <HI>Priam,</HI> met the fair <HI>Grecian Helen;</HI> and here they tempted each other to the fatal Rape, which armed the jealous <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and revenging <HI>Greece</HI> for the utter destruction of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>The Isle is of no great extent, being not above sixty miles; yet 'twas of great consequence to the <HI>Spar∣tans,</HI> when they were Masters of it; for it was to them as it were a Rampart and a shelter to their ships, which they sent to <HI>Aegypt.</HI> They sent thither eve∣ry year a President to regulate civil and military affairs; and the keeping of this Isle was then so necessary, that in the eighth year of the <HI>Peleponnesian</HI> War, the <HI>Athenians</HI> having won it, <HI>Sparta</HI> was without defence, and its Country lay open to the Enemy, till they hasted to fortifie and put Garrisons in the neigh∣bouring places.</P>
<P>The little Isle, or rather Rock, called <HI>de Cervi,</HI> lies between Port <HI>Rapini</HI> and

<HI>Cape St. Angelo,</HI> where with the firm Land it makes a Channel, unnavigable by Reason of the Banks of Sand that are in it.</P>
<P>The nearest Rocks to <HI>Cerigo</HI> are the <HI>Dragonier,</HI> which have a good Ancho∣rage, and may be sailed from with any Wind, the others that are seen be∣tween this Isle and <HI>Candia,</HI> are <HI>Ovo,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Eple, Oso, Doi, Poro, Poressa, Cicerigo,</HI> or <HI>Cerigotto,</HI> which the Ancients called <HI>Egila,</HI> or <HI>Egiale;</HI> it is the nearest to <HI>Cape Spada,</HI> and the largest of all.

<P>This City was once an Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a School of Ver∣tue; and all the Princes that have pos∣sessed it, have been ambitious to leave their Names upon some Monuments, thereby to gain an immortality in the Memory of man.

<HEAD><HI>The Isle and Kingdom of</HI> Negro∣pont.</HEAD>
<P>THE Isle of <HI>Negropont</HI> is the most considerable of all the Isles in the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> It has had divers Names, and that of <HI>Negropont</HI> has by corrupti∣on been changed into <HI>Egripont;</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Egribos,</HI> the Latins <HI>Euboea,</HI> either from the Retreat of the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Asopus,</HI> or of <HI>Inachus</HI> thither, whom the Poets feign to be turned in∣to a Cow; which from its lowing is named <HI>Euboea.</HI></P>
<P>It has also been called <HI>Macris</HI> from the Channel called so in Greek, <HI>Aban∣tias</HI> from the People <HI>Abantides, Calcis</HI> and <HI>Chalcondantis: Pliny</HI> likewise gives it the name of <HI>Asopis,</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> says 'twas called <HI>Oche,</HI> and that once 'twas called <HI>Ellopia</HI> from <HI>Ellopus</HI> the Son of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>

Some have thought that this Isle was once joyned to <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and thence sepa∣rated by Earth-quakes; or as others say, by the swift and impetuous course of the waves, which make the Canal called <HI>Euripus.</HI> The Isle is three hun∣dred sixty five miles round, in length, from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North</HI> ninety miles, and forty broad, and twenty in the narrow∣est part. At which place it is joyned by a Bridge to the main Land.</P>
<P>It is, as it were, encompassed with two Promontories, <HI>Cape Lithar,</HI> and <HI>Cape dell' Oro.</HI> The first facing the Gulf of <HI>Volo</HI> is by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> called <HI>Ce∣naeum Promontorium,</HI> by <HI>Pliny Caeneum,</HI> and by <HI>Niger Canaia.</HI> Near this Pro∣montory was the coast of <HI>Artemisia,</HI> so called from a Temple of that name there erected: At which place the <HI>Greeks</HI> shelter'd their naval forces, during their wars with the King of <HI>Persia.</HI> The second looking toward the East part of the <HI>Archipelago, Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Caphare∣um Promontorium, Sophianus Chymium, Niger Capo figera, Stephanus Cathereus, Lycophron Zarax, Isacius Xylophagos.</HI> Upon the Top of this Promontory, <HI>Nauplius</HI> King of <HI>Negropont</HI> made fires,
<PB N="206" REF="143"/>
that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army returning from <HI>Troy,</HI> might by the light thereof arrive safely at the Haven. There was for∣merly three cities in the Isle, which made it famous, <HI>Ellopia, Histiaea</HI> and <HI>O∣raeus</HI> Cities, that were joyned together by reason of their vicinity.</P>
<P>The Capital City of the Kingdom of <HI>Negropont</HI> was at first called in the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI> Tongue <HI>Calcis;</HI> and then it took the name of the Kingdom it self. It was once the seat of a Bishop, <HI>Suffragan</HI> to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Athens;</HI> afterwards 'twas raised to an Arch-Bishoprick.</P>
<P>'Tis situated on the banks of the <HI>Eu∣ripus:</HI> The compass of its walls is about two miles, but there are more houses and people in the Suburbs, where the <HI>Christians</HI> dwell, than in the City, inha∣bited by <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> have there two Mosques, and two o∣thers without, where the <HI>Christians</HI> also have their Churches. The <HI>Jews</HI> have an house, where they instruct the Youth. All the Inhabitants make about 15000. The City is divided from the Suburbs by a great Ditch with a flat bottom, in a smooth and even ground.</P>
<P>There is a Captain <HI>Basha</HI> that com∣mands
<PB N="207" REF="143"/>
the whole Isle, and part of <HI>Boeo∣tia,</HI> who has in his absence his Kiaja or Lieutenant, and his Subkiaja. There is also a Bey or Lord, who has some Reve∣nues, and is obliged to maintain a Gal∣ley. At the place where the strait of the <HI>Euripus</HI> is narrowest to pass over into the Isle, they go over a stone bridge of five little Arches not above thirty paces long, and so under a Tower in the middle of the Channel, built by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> where St. <HI>Mark</HI> is yet seen over the Gate. From the Tower to the City is but one Draw-bridge about twenty paces long, built on sharp bot∣tomed boats, which is raised half to the Tower, and the other half to the Ci∣ty, to give passage to the Galleys and o∣ther Vessels, which cannot easily be done without taking in their Oars.</P>
<P>There is also to be seen the Episco∣pal City, at present called <HI>Carisso,</HI> once <HI>Chironia,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> names <HI>Caristus</HI> and <HI>Caristos, Sophianus Castel Rosso,</HI> and the <HI>French Chateauroux,</HI> it acknowledges <HI>Calcis</HI> for its Metropolis, being sixty miles distant. It stands near <HI>Cape Caefa∣reo.</HI> There was besides another Epis∣copal City <HI>Eretria,</HI> which <HI>Moletius</HI> calls
<PB N="208" REF="144"/>
<HI>Rocho,</HI> which in his time was not less famous than <HI>Calcis,</HI> which once was an <HI>Athenian</HI> Colony built on the banks of the <HI>Euripus</HI> before the first destruction of <HI>Troy:</HI> both these Cities have perisht by the falsness of their own Inhabitants; So that now their names only remain: They were once pillaged and burnt by <HI>Darius.</HI></P>
<P>The soil of the Isle is stony and sandy, but this is only upon the top, for digging deeper they find it very good. There are several Forests, where good ship timber may be cut. Near <HI>Caristus</HI> is a Mountain of the same name of very beautiful marble: And near to it is found the <HI>Asbestos</HI> stone, which may be spun and made into cloth, which by put∣ting in the fire grows white. There were formerly in the Territory of <HI>Cal∣cis</HI> Iron and copper Mines, which are now lost. The Isle produces cotton e∣nough to make Sails for a great Navy. There are several hot baths. It is wa∣tered with two Rivers, <HI>Fimileus</HI> and <HI>Ce∣reus,</HI> of which the Poets said, that one made the Sheep have black wool, the other white. In sine the Isle abounds in all things; and Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth ad∣vised several great Captains to go and
<PB N="209" REF="144"/>
begin the War with the <HI>Turk</HI> in this Kingdom; because it is capable of main∣taining a whole Army, besides it has good Ports on the side of the Continent. It is true indeed, that when one is once there, he can by no means get out to save himself. There are several places on the South part, the most considera∣ble whereof is called <HI>Spiritus.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Pietro Zani</HI> was Doge, the Re∣publick inlarged their Dominions by this beautiful Kingdom, which was yielded to them by the Emperor of <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> as a reward for the good ser∣vices they had done him. The first Go∣vernour that was sent was <HI>Pictro Barbo,</HI> named <HI>il Zanco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1469. the <HI>Turks</HI> attempting the Conquest of it, came with three hundred Sail. At first they made a Bridge upon the <HI>Euripus,</HI> that so they might land their Troops upon the Campaign of the Isle; but those of the Country so vigorously opposed them, that they were forced to return to their Galleys. Within a a Month <HI>Mahomet</HI> came himself with an Army of twelve thousand Men: He made a new Bridge over the Channel, from the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> a mile off
<PB N="210" REF="145"/>
of the City, and by this means made himself a way to attach <HI>Negropent.</HI> This City was in some sort fortified at that time, and had in it in Garrison twenty four thousand Men under <HI>Ludo∣vico Calbo</HI> and <HI>Paolo Erizzo</HI> Comman∣ders. The last had been Governour of the City, and tho his time was expired, yet he would not leave the place, when he might contribute by his Arms and Counsel, to its defence, and signalize his zeal for the Service of his Country. The <HI>Turks</HI> raised several Batteries in di∣vers places, and continually plaid upon the Walls. And four times march'd to the assault, where four thousand <HI>Turks</HI> were killed. The Place was besieged by Sea and Land, and extremely pressed on all hands; yet the besieged still defended themselves with advantage, and had already sustained a months Siege, when a treasonable practice was discovered. For a little Girl found a letter, wherein was mentioned the means and way of delivering up the place to the <HI>Ottomans.</HI> This letter was directed to <HI>Thomaso Schiava. Luigi Delfino</HI> transported with indignation against the Traitor, attacked him
<PB N="211" REF="145"/>
openly, and by meer force made him discover all the base Intrigues he had with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The besieged still animated more and more in their defence, gave daily nota∣ble proofs of their courage and constan∣cy; but at last they were almost wea∣ried out with continual labour and fa∣tigue. In these extremeties, they, who had the Guard of <HI>Porte Bureliana,</HI> ran a∣way from their Post, and left the place the twelfth of <HI>July,</HI> 1649.</P>
<P>The Enemy soon perceiving the place deserted, and the entrance of the Gate free for them, entered the Town, and gave in all places dreadful marks of their Barbarity. <HI>Calbo</HI> was killed in the Place, and <HI>Bondulmiero</HI> in his house. <HI>Paolo Erizzo</HI> beeing retrenched in an ad∣vantageous Post valiantly defended him∣self, and the <HI>Sultan</HI> promised him life if he would deliver himself up, which having done the cruel <HI>Turk</HI> broke his word, and caused him to be sawed in two. One of his Daughters a very beautiful Virgin chose rather to be stabb'd than receive the Sultans caresses. All were murdered above twenty years old. This done <HI>Mahomet</HI> left the City
<PB N="212" REF="146"/>
with a Garrison for the Guard of the whole Isle and Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the Ebb and Flow of the</HI> Euripus.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Euripus</HI> is a strait of the <HI>Egaean</HI> Sea, so narrow, that scarce one Gal∣ley can pass it (under a Bridge that is made over it) between the Cittadel and the Tower or Dungeon of <HI>Negro∣pont.</HI> It has been called <HI>Euripus Eubolcus,</HI> from the old name of the Isle, or <HI>Ghal∣cidicus</HI> from the ancient City <HI>Chalcis;</HI> the <HI>Latins</HI> named it <HI>Euripus,</HI> those of the place <HI>Egripos,</HI> the <HI>Italians Stretto di Ne∣greponte,</HI> and the <HI>French l' Euripe de Chal∣cidoine,</HI> or <HI>le detroit de l' Euripe.</HI> It is a∣bout sixty miles long with little Gulfs in divers places.</P>
<P>Its Ebb and Flow is doubtless one of the greatest wonders in the World, and it is fabled, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> drowned himself in it out of grief that he could not find out the cause thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Antiphilus,</HI> a Native of <HI>Bizantium,</HI> says in a Greek <HI>Epigram,</HI> that the <HI>Euri∣pus</HI> rises and falls six times; <HI>Strabo, Pli∣ny</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="146"/>
and <HI>Suidas,</HI> with several others, hold, that it flows and ebbs seven times a day.</P>
<P><HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> assures us, that this is done fourteen times a day, tho it seems by his words, that he means, that the <HI>Euripus</HI> continually ebbs and flows four∣teen times in 24 hours. These are his words, <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 7. <HI>Mare rapidum et alterno cursu septies nocte fluctibus invicem versis, adeo immodicè fluens, ut ventos etiam ac plenis velis navigia frustretur.</HI> That is, <HI>the Sea is there very rapid, running sometimes one way, sometimes the other se∣ven times in a night, and as oft in the day with returning waves, with that violence that they prevail against the winds, and put a stop to ships under Sail.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> seems to be of the same Opini∣on in one of his Tragedies, where he thus speaks:</P>
<Q>Euripus undas flectit instabilis vagas, Septemque cursus flectit, &amp; totidem refert Dum lassa Titan mergat Oceano Juga.</Q>
<L><PB N="214" REF="147"/>
Swift <HI>Euripus</HI> receives within his breast</L>
<L>Seven times the stoods, as oft are out∣ward prest,</L>
<L>While <HI>Titan</HI> drives his weary Steeds to rest.</L>
<P>It seems also that <HI>Pliny</HI> would express the same, that it flows and ebbs seven times a day, and as often at night, though his words are not very clear. <HI>Quorumdam Aestuariorum privata natura est, velut Taurominitani saepius et in Euboea septies die ac nocte reciprocantis:</HI> That is, <HI>there are Currents of a very peculiar Nature, as that of the Taurominians, which often goes, and returns, and that of the</HI> Euripus, <HI>which does so seven times in a day and night.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Titus Livius</HI> thinks he has hit the truth better, than the rest. <HI>The</HI> Euri∣pus, says he, <HI>has not seven regular ebbs and flows in a day, as the common report is, but it runs sometimes one way, some∣times another, like the wind, as a Tor∣rent, falling with precipitation from a moun∣tain.</HI> This agrees very well with the irregular days, but he is mistaken when he adds, that there is no Port worse, than that of <HI>Calcis,</HI> by reason of the
<PB N="215" REF="147"/>
Current; for this ebbing and flowing, does not at all disorder the Vessels, which have room enough to keep them∣selves from the Current, either in the great Port, which is covered with the walls of the Cittadel, or in that on the other side of the Bridge, as Father <HI>Babin</HI> the Jesuit observed, <HI>Anno</HI> 1669. when the <HI>Turkish</HI> Navy wintered at <HI>Negropont.</HI></P>
<P>The same Father, considered the course of the <HI>Euripus,</HI> at several times. There are eighteen or nineteen days each month, or to say better each Moon, whereon 'tis regular; and eleven others, wherein 'tis irregular, and broken. Such are the Terms, they use at <HI>Negropont,</HI> to describe this wonder of Nature.</P>
<P>It is in its force and vigour, or to speak plainer, it is regular from the three lasts days of the old Moon, till the eighth of the new, and on the ninth 'tis irregular and broken, and remains so troubled, till the thirteenth inclu∣sively. On the fourteenth it comes to it self again, and resumes its Forces; but grows disorderly again, from the twenty first to the 27, as will be better understood by the following Table.</P>

<P>So each Moon there is eleven days of irregularity, and 18 or 19 others, that are regular. It is then irregular from the first Quarter, to about the full Moon, and after the last Quarter it begins a∣gain to be irregular.</P>
<P>During the time of its Irregularity in one natural day, that is, in twenty four or twenty five hours, there is eleven, twelve, thirteen, and sometimes four∣teen Floods and Ebbs, according to the observations of the same Father; and as those assure us, that are daily at the Mills, and find the wheels alter often in a day, as the Stream turns. So that the Flood does not come only seven times in a day, as the Ancients wrote, but much frequenter.</P>
<P>When the Course of the <HI>Euripus</HI> is regular for the other eighteen or
<PB N="218" REF="149"/>
nineteen days; 'tis like the Ocean, and Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> that is in twenty four, or twenty five hours, it has but two Floods and Ebbs, and every day retards it one hour; as in the Ocean, it is six hours coming in, and as long going out, whether in Summer, or whether the wind be violent or calm. On the irregular days, it flows about half an hour, and ebbs three quarters of an hour.</P>
<P>All the Tides of the <HI>Euripus,</HI> whether regular, or irregular, differ in two parti∣culars, from those of the Ocean; first, that in high water, it rises not above one Foot, and very rarely two, whereas the Ocean rises sometimes eighty cubits, as in the Ports of <HI>Britain,</HI> though in the Isles of <HI>America,</HI> it mounts not high∣er, than in the <HI>Euripus.</HI></P>
<P>The other difference, is that in the Ocean, when the water sinks and abates, it retires into the deep Sea, as on the contrary, it raises it self, and covers more ground, when it approaches the sides. The <HI>Euripus</HI> is quite after ano∣ther manner, for its Flood happens, when its waters run towards the Isles of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where is a much
<PB N="219" REF="149"/>
greater Sea; and its Ebb is when it runs towards <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and through the Chan∣nel, by which the Galleys pass to go towards <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> as a shorter and safer way to <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Between high and low water, there is a short interval, when the water seems quiet and still, and like standing wa∣ter so that straws and feathers lie upon the water without motion, provided there be no wind.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar d' Arcons,</HI> who printed in <HI>French</HI> a Book in <HI>Quarto,</HI> concerning the Ebb and Flow of the Sea, has a particular Paragraph of the Tides of the <HI>Euripus.</HI></P>

who was Proveditor of the Army, <HI>Anno</HI> 1655. being informed of the mat∣ter, resolved to turn his Arms against this Fortress, designing to raze it as soon as he had it, concluding by that means, he should deprive the Enemy of a great advantage, and at the same time furnish his Army with Provision for a long time. He neglected nothing, that might gain a good Success to his Enterprize. He lay with his whole Ar∣my before the Fortress, and began to attack it very briskly with great shot. These beginnings were of the greater advantage to the Besiegers, in that the <HI>Turks</HI> never expected so hot an onset. The danger increased every moment, and the loss grew more certain; but they could not as yet be brought to think up∣on a Capitulation, nor of rendering the place. But when they saw the Petard fastened to the Gate, and the Ladders at the walls, they had no more Courage to defend it. They, that were at the Gates, left them, and they upon the walls de∣serted them, all seeking safety in their heels. The Bassa that commanded it, and an <HI>Aga,</HI> at first thought to save themselves in a place built in the form

of a little Castle in the Fortress; but perceiving the Necssity of miserably Perishing there, lest they should be shut in, immediately went out of it. Thus General <HI>Morosini</HI> succeeded glo∣riously in this Expedition; he present∣ly ordered all the Bisket found in the Place, and which amounted to above four Millions of Livres, to be transpor∣ted; they also found there other Am∣munition, and 27 great Guns: Then he set on fire the Magazines, Houses, and Mosques; and wholly to raze it, before he left the Place, he levelled the Walls to the ground with his Cannon.</P>

<P>THE Gulf of <HI>Salonichi</HI> has an Ex∣tent of 140 Miles length; it is bounded by a very beautiful Plain, whence it is necessarily exposed to the Winds, and therefore very dangerous to the Sea-man<HI>:</HI> In that Place where it most wears away the Land, is a very advantageous and spacious Port. There
<PB N="223" REF="153"/>
is situated, partly on an Hill, and partly on a Declivity, as the Ground goes, the famous City of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> called usually <HI>Salonichi,</HI> or otherwise <HI>Thessa∣lonique;</HI> near it, on the West side, glides down the River <HI>Vardar,</HI> which <HI>Ptole∣my</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> call <HI>Axius Fluvius,</HI> others <HI>Bardarus</HI> and <HI>Bardarius Fluvius,</HI> very full of Fish, and its Banks covered and adorned with goodly Trees. The Walls of the City are flanked with seve∣ral Towers, and as to its circuit some make it ten, others twelve miles. It has three Forts to defend it; the first, being the least, comes first in view at the Entrance or Landing-Place at some distance from the old City; 'tis Mouted with 20 great Guns. The two others are situated within View of the Sea, at the highest Part of the Wall, furnished with 30 or 40 Cannon; on the Land side is a Fortress like that of the seven Towers at <HI>Constantinople;</HI> this com∣mands the whole Town, being built on a little Hill, at the Foot whereof is a very great Number of Houses making a Suburbs, encompassed with a Wall apart, but which joyns to the City.</P>
<P>There are in this place a numerous

People, and the great Number of Habi∣tations that are built in the Plain are but low and base, and not sufficient to contain the great Numbers of <HI>Jews</HI> that dwell in them: Besides they are not a little incommoded by the horrid stink that is in the Streets, they are so narrow.</P>
<P>There is a considerable Trade, as well from the commodiousness of its Situation, as for the great Quantity of Silk, Wool, Skins of all sorts, Wax, Gun-powder, Corn, Cotton, and Iron. The <HI>Jews</HI> most busy themselves in Traffick, and have to themselves the Manufacture of Stuffs to cloath the Ja∣nizaries; and by this means they find a Way to employ the Tribute they are obliged to pay the Grand Seignior. There are in it 48 Mosques, in which is comprehended the Church of St. <HI>De∣metrius,</HI> of three Iles, born up with very fair Pillars, where St. <HI>Paul</HI> Prea∣ched once; and that of St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> built by the Emperour, <HI>Justinian,</HI> thir∣ty Greek Churches, thirty six great Synagogues, and many other small ones. The Governour has the Title of <HI>Mulà,</HI> and his Place makes him very considerable at the Port.</P>

In the Year 118, when <HI>Andronicus</HI> would have got the Empire, <HI>Thessalo∣nica</HI> was taken by <HI>William,</HI> King of <HI>Si∣cily;</HI> but at the end, being returned under the Dominion of its lawful So∣veraign, the Emperour of <HI>Constantinople, Andronicus Paleologus;</HI> he, to unite himself the more nearly to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Republick, gave them all the Right he had to this City: But scarce two years past e're the <HI>Turk</HI> seized on it without much Difficulty, by reason of its Di∣stance, and the ill State of Affairs in <HI>I∣taly,</HI> and the small Defence the Inhabi∣tants were able to make.</P>

<P>THIS Gulf reaching on the North to the Shores of <HI>Achaia,</HI> and on the South to those of the <HI>Morea,</HI> divides from each other these two great Parts of <HI>Greece.</HI> It has had several Names which Authors have given it according to the different Times and particular Occasions they had to speak of it.
<PB N="226" REF="156"/>
The Ancients called it <HI>Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus; Strabo,</HI> the Sea of <HI>Alcion; Sophianus, Golfe de Pedras;</HI> some, <HI>Corintiacus Sinus,</HI> from the City <HI>Corinth;</HI> the Mariners, (as <HI>Niger</HI> reports) the Shores of the <HI>Bo∣stria,</HI> and now commonly <HI>Lepanto:</HI> It contains four Rocks in it, and receives its Water from the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea by an Entrance between two Promontories, standing far out from the Continent, whereof one joyning to the <HI>Morea,</HI> is by <HI>Strabo</HI> called <HI>Anthirium Promontorium,</HI> and usually <HI>Cape Antirio,</HI> upon the top of which is a Fortress called of <HI>Morea,</HI> or of <HI>Patras;</HI> the other joy∣ning to <HI>Achaia,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> calls <HI>Rhium Promontorium;</HI> and the Vulgar, <HI>Cap de Rhio,</HI> or <HI>Rio;</HI> this also is provided with a Fort called <HI>Romelie.</HI></P>
<P>These two Castles are otherwise called the <HI>Dardanelles</HI> of <HI>Lepanto:</HI> They are both built of a square Figure, en∣compassed with good Walls, and a strong Battery, level with the Water; there is no Fault to be found with them, but that the Ground being Sandy, they admit of an easy Approach from the Enemy. There is no landing any For∣ces on the side of <HI>Romelie,</HI> within two

The Plain to the little Hill is very large, but it grows less and less as you come nearer to the Castle. At the Foot of the Mountain is a great Valley, where those that de∣sign to attack the Fort may march for∣ward undiscovered.</P>
<P>All Merchandises brought out of the Gulf, as Skins, Oyls, Tabaco, Rice, and Barly, pay three <HI>per cent.</HI> to the Emin, who is likewise obliged to dis∣burse six thousand Crowns a year, into the Coffers of the Grand Seignior.</P>
<P>Once all Merchandises that came from the West, as likewise those from the East, after having passed the Gulf of <HI>Engia,</HI> were brought into this Port; but at this time the Entrance is forbid to all stranger Ships, which upon that Account are obliged to stay at <HI>Patras;</HI> and the most of those that put in here are <HI>Corsairs,</HI> and indeed one calls <HI>Le∣panto</HI> the little <HI>Algiers.</HI> The greatest part of the Inhabitants of this Place are Moors that have black Children like those of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>City of Lepanto</HI> is by the La∣tins called <HI>Naupactus;</HI> by the Vulgar, <HI>Epactos;</HI> and by the <HI>Turks, Ei∣nebachti;</HI> 'tis situated in the Country of <HI>Livadia,</HI> on the Edge, not far from the Mouth of the Gulf of the same Name, invironed with an high conical Mountain, on the Top of which is built a Fortress with four strong thick Walls round it, separated from each o∣ther by little Distances, where the In∣habitants have their Dwellings; the Port is not above 60 Foot big, and which may be shut up with a Chain being but narrow at its Entrance, upon which Account, but a few Vessels can lie there; and at sometimes also they cannot get out of it for want of Wa∣ter: And if the famous Pirate, <HI>Du∣rach Bey,</HI> used to shelter himself there with his Galleys, he must have taken a special Care to keep it clear.</P>

<P>If the Inhabitants want pleasant Pla∣ces within the Town, they have, with∣out, on the East side near the Sea, a plentiful Stream of Water, which after having served the Powder-Mills and the Tanners of Leather, in which con∣sists the Riches of the Place, waters about a dozen very great Plains, and makes the Place very delightful. There is likewise round about very pleasant Gardens and Fields covered with Li∣mons and Orange Trees: The Soil produces a Wine that surpasses all the Greek Wines in Goodness.</P>
<P>The taking of this Place was very Difficult, before the Use of great Guns. In the Year 1408, it was subject to the Emperour of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but the Emperour, <HI>Emanuel,</HI> finding it too hard

The Inhabitants could not be better pleased with their Rulers, nor ever made more ardent Vows to be kept there and preserved from the barbarous Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> when <HI>Bajazet,</HI> 2. came to attack them by Sea and Land, with an Army of an hundred and fifty thousand men, and brought them to the most deplorable State that can be ima∣gined. There is yet to be seen St. <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> to shew us, that the Rights of the Republick are as well founded there as its Arms ineffaceable; and to give us Hopes, that trium∣phant Republick will add to the Con∣quests it has made these last Years, that of this Place; which will be crow∣ned with Glory and immortal Fame.</P>
