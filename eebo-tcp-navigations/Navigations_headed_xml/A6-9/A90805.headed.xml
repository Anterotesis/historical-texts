<HEAD>THE Policy of France, And the MAXIMS of <HI>LEWIS</HI> the XIV. Discovered to all EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not Birth which chiefly distinguishes Princes from other Men, but their Parts and Abilities: How many of them find we in History; who having but an indiffe∣rent share of them, make no other figure, but to fill up Genealogy; and whose Birth-days, and the days of their Death, are the only two which make any noise in the World. 'Tis according as this Spirit or Genius is disposed in a Soveraign, that he acts for the good and welfare, or for the misfortune and undoing of his People. <HI>Wo to thee O Land,</HI> saith the Wise Man, <HI>when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the Morning: Blessed art thou, O Land,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due season for Strength, and not for Drunkenness.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation were happy under <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> but <HI>Rehoboam</HI> spoke to them in this manner, <HI>My little Fin∣ger shall be thicker than my Fathers Loyns; for whereas my Father put an heavy Yoak upon you, I will put more to your Yoak: My Father chastised you with Whips, but I will chastise you with Scorpions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> was called <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> Father of the People of <HI>Rome;</HI> but <HI>Nero</HI> their Hangman. <HI>Philip</HI> II. was born of a wise Father, who Reigned with general applause; but yet he was a Blood-thirsty Man, who spared not his own Blood, and squandred away what <HI>Charles</HI> V. had pre∣served with so much Glory and Prudence. <HI>Francis</HI> the First was the Idol of the <HI>French,</HI> and Darling of the Nobility; he acquired the Title of a mild, gentle Prince in peace, Victorious in War, the Father and Restorer of Learning and liberal Arts; but <HI>Charles</HI> IX. that of Murtherer.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> IV. was surnamed the Great, by reason of his great Actions, he was the Darling and Father of his People, and his beneficent sweet disposition seem'd to promise a happy Reign, if a cursed Hand had not put a stop to the course of his Life. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. was surnamed the Just, grounded without doubt upon the Gospel, which assures us, <HI>That blessed are the poor in Spirit, and that theirs is the King∣dom of Heaven.</HI> It was rather <HI>Richlieu</HI>'s Spirit that reigned than his.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. did not discover his Inclinations whilst he was under the Tuition of his Mother and <HI>Mazarines</HI> lash, but so soon as ever this latter was dead, he shewed what he was.</P>
<P>His Flatterers in imitation of his Grand father gave him the Name of <HI>Great,</HI> although he had not as yet deserved it. 'Tis true indeed, He is Great, as to his Ambition, a great
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Usurper of the Territories of his Neighbour, a great Ene∣my to the Holy See, to the Pope, and a great Persecutor of the Hugonots, His Reign is full of nothing but great Mono∣polyes, and his <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> are the only <HI>passe par touts,</HI> or Keys that open the Gates to his Conquests. He was born Armed, and his first nourishment was the Blood of his Nur∣ses which he drew himself, that ambitious Spirit he is possest withall, would willingly sacrifice a good part of his Subjects to his Passion and Greatness: Wo be to thee O Land that groans under the burthen of such a Prince! Wo to that People enslaved under his Dominion! Under the Reign of <HI>Antiochus</HI> the Illustrious, the <HI>Jews</HI> often cryed to God, that he would deliver them out of the hand of their Oppressor: Why may not the <HI>French</HI> put up the like Petition; nay, and all <HI>Europe</HI> besides to be delivered out of the hands of that Usurper. <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great thought he already held in his hand the Scepter of the Monarchy of all <HI>Europe,</HI> when <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> was besieged; yea, he thought it within two hairs breadth of its destruction, which he supposed inevitable, grounded upon the Prophesies of <HI>Drabitius;</HI> but perceiving this way stopt up, he betakes himself to his first Errors and former Road, he waits with great impatience to see what the Snares which he lay'd at the time of the Queen of <HI>Spains</HI> Marriage, will produce: Man purposes, but God disposeth.</P>
<P>Time impairs the Mind as well as the Body, and Princes are oftentimes fain to let their Successors do what they were not able to do themselves, and so much the more, because that same Divine Providence, on which Princes depend as well as the rest of Mankind, doth not mete here below by the measure of their Ambition: Ambitious Men build Ca∣stles in the Air, and by their good will would possess the whole Earth beside. This itch reigns at this day in <HI>France,</HI> and this is it which quite takes up the mind of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>as we shall see by the sequel, and the course he takes to accomplish his Designs.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Policy of <HI>France,</HI> and its Maxims in respect of all <HI>Europe</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<P>HEretofore Men accused <HI>Spain</HI> for aspiring to an Univer∣sal Monarchy: If it was so, I suppose <HI>Philip</HI> II. begun to lose this hope, when he perceiv'd the Sea and Winds op∣pose his designs, and that the <HI>Armada,</HI> which he called In∣vincible, (on Board of which he thought to have brought into <HI>Spain</HI> the <HI>British Isles,</HI> &amp;c.) came to nothing, and that his choicest Troops who were embarqued therein, served only to fight against the Waves, and feed the Fishes of the Sea; moreover, when he saw, that during the whole War of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> (a small handful of People whom he called <HI>Gueux</HI> or Beggers, in derision) were alwayes able to hold up their Head against him, nay, and to beat him in se∣veral Encounters, until such time as in the Year 1609, he was fain to cry Quarter, make a Truce with the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> and acknowledge them for Free States.</P>
<P>This was a very bitter Pill, and would scarce go down with a Prince who was so highly ambitious: But it behoved him to swallow it, and it wrought so strongly upon him, that he lost Seven Provinces at a clap by it, and part of the <HI>Indies:</HI> Insomuch, That this longing desire after the Universe began to abate by reason of his Age which had already lost the first heat of Youth, and by reason of the bad success of all his Enterprizes. <HI>Philip</HI> III. was as little fortunate as he, and <HI>Philip</HI> IV. had great disappointments towards <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the <HI>Low Countreyes</HI> and was very glad by clapping up a Peace to acknowledge those who had been his Subjects for a Free and Soveraign Commonwealth, holding of none but God Almighty. <HI>Charles</HI> XI. Reigning at present is a good Prince, who loves his ease, and would willingly quit all the Claims and Titles of his Ancestors to an Universal Mo∣narchy for a Son and Heir to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to succeed him. <HI>Malherbe</HI> told us long since, that if it were true, that <HI>Spain</HI> aspir'd to an Universal Monarchy, he would advise his King to beg of God to prolong the World as much as he can. This Malady ceasing in <HI>Spain,</HI> hath passed into <HI>France;</HI> but <HI>France</HI> being wiser doth not grasp so much, and her King's Ambition is only confined to <HI>Europe,</HI> a wish worthy of such a great Prince; and who, if we consider him aright, could scarce demand less; his Neighbours ought narrowly to watch his water; for certain it is, <HI>France</HI> cannot aggran∣dize her self without encroaching upon her nearest Neigh∣bours; as she doth really every day already. When the House of <HI>Austria</HI> made broad signs of her design upon the Universe; all the Princes of Christendom rose up against her, and entered into an Association to prevent her. <HI>Charles</HI> V. after the Battel of <HI>Pavia,</HI> where <HI>Francis</HI> was ta∣ken Prisoner; thought himself above all, but he found bu∣siness enough. The Pope, King of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the Grand Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> the <HI>Swisse</HI> made a League against him, to hinder this Emperour from bringing <HI>France,</HI> and consequently the rest of <HI>Italy</HI> under his subjection. It was not for any kindness the Pope and King of <HI>England</HI> bore King <HI>Francis,</HI> that they combin'd together to relieve him, but because <HI>Charles</HI> V. became so great, that he would by his good Will have made himself Master of the World. Now at present, forasmuch as this Itch is past into <HI>France,</HI> All Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> for some time have run counter to
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>whatsoever their Ancestors did in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> V, and <HI>Philip</HI> II. and instead of opposing they have abetted and concurr'd with the designs of <HI>France,</HI> some out of base compliance, others out of fear. There are none but the Princes of <HI>Nassau</HI> alone who have alwayes been fatal to whosoever had a mind to aspire to this sublime Monarchy of the Universe: Do not Men admire with me the wretched Policy of several Princes and States in the World, who look on with their Armes a cross, and behold the <HI>French</HI> King to advance so fast, and take <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> a City of such grand Importance to <HI>Europe;</HI> only the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> presented himself upon the breach with the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> but who not being in a capacity to do any thing by him∣self, was forced to retreat: The <HI>French</HI> King would never have taken it, had <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> withstood it, he hath no cause to brag of it; it is a truth all the World knows but too well; he was so cunning to get the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> on his side, that he consented to take what was not his own, and to baffle the rest by illusory promises of an Universal Peace, after the taking in of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> which they suffered him to do; and this gross valiant Captain (of a Trencher-man) the Marquess of <HI>Grana,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> who was not promoted to this place, but upon his demonstrating the means of being able to pre∣serve this most Important place to the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> a place, I say, so necessary to <HI>Spain</HI> for the preservation of the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> by the assistance of <HI>Germany;</HI> and albeit, he should have minded nothing else, but the preservation of that same City, his own Honour, as well as Duty to, and interest of his King his Master, being all engaged therein: Instead of doing which, this Fat-gut put into it only a piti∣ful Garrison of Twelve, or Fifteen Hundred Men, instead of Four Thousand, and was wholly taken up in fortifying
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>the City of <HI>Namur</HI> with his Regiments, and some other pla∣ces which were Cities <HI>on the boundaries</HI> which <HI>France</HI> would not have dared so much as to touch: Would you not swear such a Fellow conspir'd to aggrandize <HI>France,</HI> and concurr'd with the Designs of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. When the King in 1667 would have undertaken the Conquest of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands, England, Swedeland,</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provin∣ces,</HI> associated together by the Triple League, forced him soon to quit his hold; they obliged him to re-procure, and make a Peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> and to restore to it, some part of what he had usurped and taken away. It would have been just so, if the Neighbouring Princes had done the same at such time as he attacked <HI>Luxemburg: Resist the De∣vil, and he will fly from you:</HI> But <HI>France</HI> cunning and subtle had sufficiently tryed how prejudicial this League was to her; she could never be at rest till she had pluckt this Thorn out of her Foot; and so soon as ever the term was expired, she could not be satisfied till she had found out a way to hood∣wink <HI>England,</HI> and so got her disingaged from the Tripple-knot. The Dutchess of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> like another <HI>Dalilah</HI> came over out of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> to lull asleep the <HI>Sampson</HI> of this Kingdom: <HI>France</HI> found out the way to act, and speak so fair, that she hook't in <HI>Dunkirk</HI> by Promises and Money, at the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II, King of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> A Town of so great Consequence to <HI>England,</HI> in as much as it affords a good entrance into <HI>Pi∣cardy,</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> 'Tis no new thing for <HI>France</HI> to be troubled with this itching mind to sieze on the places of her Neighbours, and to enlarge her Dominion from one end of <HI>Europe</HI> to the other. The Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> told us hereto∣fore, that Princes commanded People; but that Self-Inte∣rest commanded Princes. (Without question he would have added something else had he lived in this Age,) and especially
<PB N="8" REF="6"/><HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. We may see Examples of it, day by day, and to secure his Ambition, all times and seasons are good for him; in Peace, in War, in Cessation of Arms. Interest is the evil Angel hath so long reigned through <HI>France,</HI> we are taught out of History, how <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloign</HI> having a mind to take a Journey for the Conquest of the <HI>Holy Land;</HI> and coming short of Money to put himself in a capacity to do it, sold many of his Cities and Lands; amongst others, the City of <HI>Metz</HI> with the Country adjoyning, which its own Citizens and Inhabitants purchased of him for the Sum of an Hundred Thousand Crowns. They enjoyed this their purchase till the Year of our Lord 1551, in which <HI>Charles</HI> V. did so evilly intreat the Protestants of <HI>Germany. Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>France,</HI> under a pretence, seemed forward to send Relief to the said Protestants of <HI>Germany:</HI> In effect, he dispatched the Constable of <HI>Monmorency</HI> with Four Thousand Men, in all probability for this Expedition; but it was quite and clean for another design, as the sequel will make appear: He demanded passage of the City of <HI>Metz;</HI> who were for the most part of the same Religion with those who were molested in <HI>Germany;</HI> between whom, and the Emperour, there was no good understanding: They gran∣ted to the King with abundance of joy, whatsoever he re∣quired of them in reference to his Troops passage; and in testimony of their good will, they caused Tables to be set up in the Streets, to make the Soldiers eat and drink on their passage, with huge demonstration of Friendship and Rejoycing. But alas! Their Laughter was soon changed into Weeping; so soon as ever the Constable (who was re∣ceived by the Magistrates with all Tokens of Honour and Benevolence) had entered the City, he feigned himself to have a fit of the Gout, and to feel intolerable pains; he declared his great desire to have his Will made, not know∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>what might befal him, in the War he was about to com∣mence; and intreated the Magistrates of the City, and all the Nobility that they would assist as Witnesses of it. In the mean time he had given order to two Colonels to sieze, one of them upon the Gate by which the Troops entered, and the other on that, by which they went out. To the first, He gave order to cause part of the Army, which was still without to advance; and to the other, to bid those who were already gone out to enter in again: Now the Consta∣ble seeing the Magistrates and chief Nobility round his Bed, expecting his Orders; up starts he like a Lyon enraged, and sheathed his Ponyard in the Mayors Breast, and at the Signal given, his Guards rusht in, and Assassinated all the Nobi∣lity they met with in his Chamber; whereupon the Army that had entered the City at the same time, cryed up and down the City, The Town is won: It was plundred, and subdued to the Bloody Dominion of the King, and of an Allie as it was, soon became a Subject. This was the Bloody Conquest of <HI>Henry</HI> II. And there is your <HI>French</HI> Policy.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. not knowing how to get possession of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by the Advice and Counsel of that most Subtle and Crafty Polititian Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> comes to <HI>Lions</HI> with an Army under pretence of some design against <HI>Savoy.</HI> The <HI>Cardinal</HI> gave notice beforehand to Duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that he should make his personal appearance before the King, to pay him his respects, and assure him by word of mouth of his good intentions towards his Person. This Duke thinking no harm, suffered himself to be perswaded to it in earnest, departs from <HI>Nancy</HI> to salute the King at the head of his Troops: After he had complemented him, thinking he might return home again, he found it to be a Lions Den, arrested he was upon pretence of some old claims. His
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>Eminence at that time performing the Office of Mediator, propounded that to make his peace with the King, and that he might enjoy his Liberty, to put into the Kings hands <HI>Nancy</HI> his chief City, and the Key of his Dutchy: Thus far he must go to be freed from his Arrest: Well <HI>Nancy</HI> was de∣livered up, the King entered into it like a Conquerour with his Army at his heels: Observe the Policy of <HI>France</HI> in this particular.</P>
<P>The demolishing of the Castle at <HI>Orange</HI> is just such ano∣ther trick, shews their temper, for upon some little diffe∣rence that arose between the two Princesses, Royal, and Dowager, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. King of <HI>France,</HI> as usually he doth, would intermeddle with it, and that he might make them agree, and that the young Prince (then under Age) avoid the Expences of maintaining a Garrison there; he caused the Bastions of the Castle to be pull'd down, and left nothing but the Dungeon, which together with the Town he could take at pleasure, as since he hath done. What the same King did at <HI>Strasburg</HI> is much the same: This City look't upon its self secure after the Treaty at <HI>Nemegen,</HI> con∣firmed by the powerful Letters the King writ to them time after time, after the assurances his Resident then in the City gave them, that his Master desired nothing more than to live in a fair correspondence with the Emperour, and with the Cities of the Empire; last of all by the suits and impor∣tunities of the same Resident, a Traitor was Elected Burgo∣master, who did nothing but by the Council of <HI>France.</HI> The Magistracy and Citizens thus lull'd asleep by all these fair promises and protestations, dismist the <HI>Swisses</HI> their Guards; but they were no sooner without doors, but Mr. <HI>Louvois</HI> with a puissant Army began to invest their City; obliges them to surrender on what conditions soever he thought fit to prescribe them; even at this present they
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>make no Conscience to violate those sorry Articles which were granted to them, and to misuse them like Slaves, as he does all the rest of his Subjects. Take notice of your Humour of <HI>France,</HI> which is always restless.</P>
<P>After the peace at <HI>Nemeghen,</HI> how many Cities and Towns hath he taken in <HI>Flanders?</HI> How many of them hath he burnt and pull'd down to the Ground, to occasion the peoples revolt, to cause them to rely wholly upon him to defend them from utter ruine, and to get free from all those great Contributions wherewith he loads and op∣presses them. Take notice of the <HI>French</HI> Policy.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Pyrennean</HI> Treaty, which was but just signed, whereof this present King's Marriage was, as it were the Seal and Condition, notwithstanding all those Oaths and Promises this King took and made to his Father in Law, <HI>Philip</HI> IV. not to assist <HI>Portugal;</HI> no sooner did he return to <HI>Paris,</HI> but he sent Mounsieur <HI>Schomberg</HI> with some Regiments and Mo∣ney, and all this to weaken <HI>Spain;</HI> which made a ballance with him of the Empire of <HI>Europe,</HI> so that neither Peace, Truce, nor Promise, nor Protestation are able to sway him, when his Interest is at stake; no, nor Religion it self: How zealous a Catholick soever he would fain seem to be, is not a Fence strong enough to restrain him, as we shall make appear in the following Discourse</P>
<P>When <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. sent an Embassadour to the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> under the pretence of converting him, do you really believe this King endeavoured to extend his Mission so far? No no, he works no Conversion, but where he may send his Dragoons, who are his booted Apostles: It is to spie the Country by his Jesuits, to endeavour by means of the Sieur <HI>Constance,</HI> a <HI>Venetian</HI> by Nation, and Chief Manager of that King's Affairs, to drive out other Nations, to settle some sort of Commerce in that same Countrey; that he may
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>there have certain Emissaries, who may ever and anon put Jealousies into the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Head, by reason of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> growing Greatness in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to make the bu∣siness of <HI>Bantam</HI> serve as a pretence, making another con∣struction of it. Observe the Policy of <HI>France:</HI> She hath her politick tricks which succeed wondrous well: This is the reason why she sends none but notable Men into all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and such who are wonderful quick sigh∣ted and versed in Affairs; whom it's all one to her whe∣ther she fetch from the Camp, the Bar, or from the Church it self, as occasion serves; according to the pla∣ces wherein she would have them imployed: But more especially, it is requisite they should be dextrous and cun∣ning, brazen-faced, that they have the knack of promising fair; that they don't insist too much upon certain petty scruples, which honest men ought to have: In a word, to express it more intelligibly, they must be Cheats and Knaves; as for <HI>Spain,</HI> they most an end send thither one of the Cler∣gy, by reason that every one knows, that persons of their Character have great credit there, and in considerable esteem.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> at such time as the Parliament were more po∣werful than they be at present: Thither they sent the Mar∣quiss <HI>De Rou'vigni,</HI> who was of the Reformed Religion, and their Delegate General at Court, and was of the very same temper that all the other Ministers are, and swaid by the same politick designs.</P>
<P>Into <HI>Holland</HI> they usually send some well-spoken Man, who one would think would ruine his Master, by promising, from which the King never gets off, but by standing to no∣thing; who does what in him lies to insinuate himself in∣to the favour of your <HI>Dutch</HI> Ladies, either by play, or a libe∣ral entertainment, and as they have a mighty influence upon
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>their Husbands temper and mind, they cast about to learn of them what they were not able to know from the Husband himself: Now seeing they began to give no credit to him who resides there at present; the King, as himself confesseth in his destiny of Princes, was foret to send him his Holy Spi∣rit of <HI>France</HI> in all haste; so that by this means he might be lookt upon as sincere and infallible in whatsoever he should say.</P>
<P>To the Courts of <HI>Germany</HI> they dispatch your Brawny Fellows, who are able to bare Wine well; thereby, that they may be made fit Table Companions for the Prince, whither their Commission sends them; for at the time when the third Course comes up, when the Wine begins to ope∣rate, they speak divers things which they would not have divulged at another time: As saith the Proverb, <HI>In vino veritas.</HI> Don't believe that <HI>France</HI> sends a Church-man to <HI>Rome,</HI> and why? Because they are all inferiour to the Pope, and there is not the pittifullest Priest, but is confident, he shall be one day Cardinal; as Soldiers are, that they shall one day be Captains. Thither is sent a <HI>Nogaret,</HI> who bauls aloud; and to the Popes Infallibility, opposes the Power and Strength of his Master, the King.</P>
<P>Into other Courts, where greediness of Money prevails over their own Interest, there is not wanting presents, and such a Prince there is, who is betrayed even to his Pillow.</P>
<P>In fine, All Weapons are convenient to this Policy of <HI>France,</HI> provided they can but bring about their Design: You see in all Courts <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Officers, and all for sooth, for having fought Duels; but retiring out of their Coun∣try is not their chief business, that indeed is their pretence; but they have other aims and good instructions, and you see them after some time expir'd, return into <HI>France,</HI> to receive the reward of their employ; who bring along with them
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>information concerning the strength or weakness of the places from whence they come, which in due season may be advantagious and useful to <HI>France;</HI> yet what is most deplo∣rable, is the blindness of several Princes to intrust such like Men with Imployment, even among Protestants. Moun∣sieur <HI>Vauban</HI> the present chief Enginier of <HI>France</HI> followed this Trade particularly in <HI>Holland;</HI> 'tis confest, we must say, he serves his Master; but it behoves other Princes to have a special care of him. You are in the right, you say true, and it were to be wisht all other Potentates would do the same for the quiet of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Another Maxime of the Policy of <HI>France</HI> is, that when any Prince or Princess is to be Married, that may be for their turn, he causes Marriages to be proposed, and doth his utmost to place <HI>French</HI> Princesses in the Houses of Fo∣reign Princes, whom they never fail to teach their Lesson, and tell them it is their Duty, when time serves; and be∣fore their departure, to make them acknowledge how much they are obliged to the King; and the means whereby they may render him their acknowledgments: But yet it is of fresh date, how the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> escaped him; not but that the <HI>French</HI> King by his Ministers and Emissaries did what lay in hir power; and to his comfort, he neglected no∣thing. <HI>Spain</HI> has been too hard for him at this time: At present the Policy of <HI>France</HI> is set a work to match the Royal Prince of <HI>Poland</HI> no question with some Natural Daughter of the Kings, since they have had the boldness to dare to present such an one to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who values himself as much, not to mention his Right to value him∣self more than the Prince of <HI>Poland:</HI> Nay, I believe it had been a thing already done, had they but been sure he would have succeeded to the Crown; for failing in that, he would have brought no great Advantage to <HI>France.</HI> 'Tis very
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>improbable the King of <HI>Poland</HI> would have refused her with a considerable Dowry; for he is already much ob∣liged to the King of <HI>France,</HI> Two Hundred Thousand Li∣vers a year bestowed on one of his Sons, by giving him the Abbies of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> and St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> deserved well to be hearkned to: Besides, the Queen ought to be well satisfied therewith; her Father is made Duke and Peer of France, and they have promised to receive her as Queen, in case she comes into <HI>France,</HI> although she be born Subject to the King of <HI>France:</HI> So that it is not at all to be question'd, but that if the Crown were secured to the young Prince, the business would have been done e're now: There are Prin∣cesses enough in <HI>France</HI> to be chosen ready for this Match. Is it not to exalt himself, like the Chief Monarch of <HI>Europe</HI> to erect at <HI>Metz</HI> a Souveraign Court, before which the King makes all Kings and Princes be cited, who possess any Lands, whom he stiles his Dependants for the Ter∣ritories that no wayes belong to him; they upon default of appearing, not owning this False, Tyrannical, Universal Tribunal, he gets the Lands adjudged to him, takes possession of them without any form of Process, but by his Cannon Law. If any one contradict this, the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Monthelliard, Pettite Pierre</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and a great many other Princes will tell you, what a Monster this Chamber is, that it devours whatsoever comes in its way; and what is yet more un∣warrantable, is, that he dares ground his Right at this day to some Lands in <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the final determination this Chamber of <HI>Metz</HI> made in his behalf, as we shall shortly see in a Memorial he hath lately sent to the Diet at <HI>Ratis∣bone. France</HI> hath besides a notable Advantage to frame her Pretensions and Titles: I mean, there are so many cunning Fellows in <HI>Paris,</HI> knowing so exactly to imitate the Ancient
<PB N="16" REF="10"/><HI>Gothick</HI> Character of Five or Six Hundred Years date, that one would swear they were in reality Authentick: Now by this means they hammer out a Dependance far fetcht, which the Devil himself, as cunning as he is, could not con∣tradict: And then who knows what is still behind the Curtain, and not come to light; which will not appear but in due time and place; when a favourable opportuni∣ty shall require it. Can a Man forbear laughing when he hears the praises which these flatterers bestow on <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. perswading him he hath procured peace both to his Enemies and to all <HI>Europe.</HI> These Tales are very fit to be told to the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> as Mounsieur <HI>de Chaumont,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Embassador was not backward to do in his Speech to that King, which is to be found at large in a Book Entituled, <HI>A Voyage into Siam;</HI> and they have not been wanting in like manner to put off such sort of Trifles to the King of <HI>China;</HI> such like stories, are good for nothing else but to be obtru∣ded on those Countreys, though not here in <HI>Europe,</HI> where our Eyes have seen, and Ears heard the contrary: Is it not strange to meet with such Writers who commit such imper∣tinent Trifles as these to paper? Don't we know what the proceedings of the King of <HI>France</HI> have been to procure a Peace with the States of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces?</HI> For seeing Fortune began to change, he Agreed as touching the City of <HI>Nemeghen,</HI> which belonged to the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> so that no body went to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to demand it of him: He offers them <HI>Mastricht,</HI> which was still in his hands: Yea, If the <HI>States</HI> had not been so very hasty to grant him what he demanded, with so much importunity, and for which he made so many fair promises, he would have been glad to have defrayed all the Expence of the War: Pray who can tell what it hath cost him under hand to obtain this Peace, which he sued for with so much instant Intreaties, sparing
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>nothing that he might endeavour to get the <HI>States</HI> to slip their Necks out of the Collar, and forsake their Allies; he went so far as to surrender divers places to <HI>Spain</HI> to serve for boundaries between his Kingdom, and the <HI>Ʋnited Pro∣vinces.</HI> In saying, that if the <HI>States</HI> had not been too forward to hasten on the signing the Peace, <HI>France</HI> would have paid the Expences of the War. I hope I do not speak without good grounds for what I say; several Reasons obliged them to clap up this peace in all haste separately, because they saw their strength decreased dayly: It is certain that after the Battle at St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> which was not fought out, by reason of a Peace, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would have marcht on into <HI>France</HI> with his Troops: Moreover the King knew full well, that being forced to agitate a General Peace, it would ne∣ver be effected till he should surrender to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> all his Lands; and that he could not possibly induce the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> to restore to the <HI>Sweed,</HI> what he had taken from him according to his obligation thereto, when the Peace in particular with him was in agitation: <HI>France</HI> had a great mind to make him restore to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> his Allie, what he had lost in taking up Arms for the service of <HI>France;</HI> so that here are your sufficient reasons for demanding particular Peace with the <HI>States;</HI> and that it was not he that procured it for <HI>Europe,</HI> as he boasts and publisheth up and down: If any one was the cause of Peace to the Empire, 'twas the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces;</HI> for when they had made peace at the instant supplication of the King, the General Peace followed immediately, usher'd in by the mediation of the <HI>States General:</HI> 'Tis most certain, the King made this Peace by compulsion; he began to do things, but by halves; the <HI>States</HI> and his Allies reinforced themselves dayly. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were recovered out of their Lethargie; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> day by day became
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>more experienced; the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI>'s familiar Spirit grew feeble, and began to forsake him; part of the <HI>French</HI> Troops perished, the remainder were much harassed and worn out, <HI>Swedeland</HI> had done her worst, and was at her last shifts; so that it was absolutely necessary to afford some respite and relief to the <HI>French</HI> Troops by a Peace, being that this Peace was partly but a forc't one, the King was ob∣liged to give up whatsoever he had taken; so also it con∣tinued but a short while, and just then, when the Empe∣rour had his hands full of the <HI>Turk;</HI> and when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and his Allies had laid down their Arms, and did ac∣quiesce upon the strict performance of the Treaty of <HI>Nemeghen,</HI> the most Christian King like a Lyon, falls foul upon the <HI>Low Countreys.</HI> Now it was convenient to stop this Torrent, to deliver up a good many places, and to give ground, and to patch up a Truce in the midst of Peace, which will continue no longer than his Interest will permit; a body may say, and that truly, that <HI>France</HI> makes but small difference between her Subjects and her Neighbours. <HI>Genoua</HI> may bear me witness of the truth of this; he treads them under foot, and fleeces them all alike, when occasion serves; and when his Will and Pleasure is, who is he that dares as∣sure us, that the Truce will be a stronger Bank to put a stop to his Ambition, and his own private Ends, than the two Treaties of Peace of the <HI>Pyrenneans</HI> and <HI>Nemegen:</HI> That Numerous Army, that amounts to near One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Men, which he maintains as well in Peace, and in time of Cessation of Arms, as in time of War; sufficiently declares the <HI>French</HI> Policy that hath always one foot up ready, a going to march; and sits on thorns, having ever more Armies in a readiness to execute her designs: They make them Camp, and de-Camp, continually to be in motion, that they may use and accustom their Neighbours to it, for
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>fear they should give them occasion of suspition, when they march in good earnest to fall upon any place, or sur∣prize it.</P>
<P>One of the King of <HI>France</HI> his Maxims, is to hinder these Neighbours, lest they should augment their Forces, but re∣main alwayes in a condition, not to be able to do them harm on the sudden, except they have a mind to have them about their Ears; as we have observed at such time as the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> were partly resolved to levy Sixteen Thousand Men; what Solicitations, what delusory Promi∣ses, nay, how many Journeys did the Comte <HI>D' Avaux</HI> take to hinder it: He did nothing but talk up and down of the sincerity and reality of the Covenants on his part, just as if no body beside his Master had any Honesty; and as if he were the only Man for keeping his word in Treaties: All that was, because he saw plainly that this new Com∣mission given out, would obstruct the taking the City of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> promising that there his Master would stop, and put an end to all his Claims and Demands: But he is still as ready to take another, as he was before the taking of this City, as we saw lately at <HI>Mons;</HI> it would be all one whe∣ther the <HI>States</HI> should oppose this proceeding, or no; it would be so long as the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> should suffer them∣selves to be hood-winkt by base fear, or complaisance, wonderful advantagious indeed to promote the designs of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Europe;</HI> no body taking notice that <HI>France</HI> is as sordid as her Master; and that both of them are afraid of cold Iron.</P>
<P>All these new Conversions of some, and Persecutions of others which we see in <HI>France,</HI> is nothing but to blind the Catholick Princes, and to amuse them so long, till he fall upon some City or State, professing the Protestant Reli∣gion: The House of <HI>Austria</HI> knows too well this Stratagem;
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>she practised it her self heretofore, when she had higher designs on foot than now she hath; when she attacked a Protestant Prince, her pretence then was that she would Extirpate Heresie: This is the <HI>French</HI> King's trade at this day; it was expedient for him out of meer necessity to be∣gin at home with his own Subjects; and as that could not choose but have weaken'd him, he solicites others to do as much as he: What pains hath he taken to set the <HI>Swisse</HI> at variance, and induce the Catholick <HI>Cantons</HI> to fall out with the Protestants, and then afterwards, when they are at odds, to fall upon them? But the Pope hath redressed that, and accommodated the matter betwixt them. <HI>France</HI> hath brought it so to pass, that she hath forced the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to rid himself of his best Subjects, the Inhabitants of the Vallies being under a premunier as he is, he could not go back with his word; nay, I am fully perswaded, <HI>France</HI> would be extreamly glad that <HI>England</HI> would do the like; by that means to weaken her to such a degree, that she shall not be able to do any thing, when <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has a mind to fall upon the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> and remove from the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> all possible means to prevent it; and so by little and little, make himself Master of <HI>Europe;</HI> as we shall see by the following story of the <HI>French</HI> Policy, and its Maxims, in respect of Soveraigns in particular.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Policy of <HI>France,</HI> in respect of <HI>Rome,</HI> and His <HI>Holiness.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the World knows the Veneration and Respect all Catholick People have for the Holy See, and the Ho∣ly Father that they look upon him as Christ's Vicar upon
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>Earth, St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor, Universal Bishop, and as we are taught by the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> the most Holy Lord, to whom all Kings, Princes, and People owe an intire Obedi∣ence; fail but in this Duty, and you smell rank of Heresie; according to the Council of <HI>Constance,</HI> it deserves Fire and Faggot. Would you not swear to see <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. perse∣cute the Protestants at that rate he doth; that he is the most Devout Son his Holiness hath, whereas others do but kiss his Toe; he would out of Devotion kiss something else: But it is quite contrary: He is a very Rebellious Son, who cares not a fig for all the Holy Father's Remonstrances and Declarations, who dispoyles him of his Goods, ravishes from him his State, and makes an entry into <HI>Rome</HI> by his Embassador, as loftily and haughtily as <HI>Artaban.</HI> And here is the <HI>French</HI> Spirit to invade the Holy Father in his Pa∣trimony, Authority, and Conduct: First, In his Patrimony of the Church, by depriving him of his Regalities in <HI>France;</HI> which is a Right the Popes have enjoyed this many Ages; which the Kings, <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. his Predecessors have granted to St. <HI>Peters</HI> Successors: What Submission, what Remonstrance hath not the present Pope made to oblige the King not to incroach and seize upon the Rights of the Church; withal telling him, that such like Usurpations as these, have proved alwayes satal to Kings and Princes Fami∣lies? Yet all this hath had none effect upon him; only the King said sometimes, <HI>the Pope is a mighty good man, I would not vex him:</HI> But in the mean time, never restores what he had deprived him of. Just such another trick as he played with <HI>Spain,</HI> when in time of Peace he took from it part of the <HI>Low Countreys;</HI> he protested every where that he had no Intent to break the Peace, but only took his Depen∣dances, and what of Right was his own. You may turn the <HI>French</HI> Policy loose which way you will; it presently finds
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>out a way to oblige his Holiness to permit an Assembly of the Clergy of his Kingdom in the year 1682, wherein it was declared, as we all know, that he was not Infallible; that he had no Power over the Temporalities of Kings, that he was subject to Counsels, and by himself he had not any power to make any one Article of Faith. Could he have thwar∣ted the Pope more sensibly in his Authority than he did at that time; besides, he obliged all the Preachers, Monks and Jesuits themselves, to teach the same in the Pulpit, and in their Colledges to their Auditors. The Arch-bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who was President of this Assembly, who as you may well think, was not too well beloved at <HI>Rome?</HI> thought at least it was fit to make himself fear'd, that they might come and offer him a Cardinals Cap. To this effect he writ into <HI>En∣gland,</HI> to be informed what course <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. took when he altered the Religion in that Kingdom; yet all this had not the least effect upon the Popes mind, who knows his own Tribe better than so; and Mounsieur Arch-bishop was in great danger to stand bare a long time without a Cardinals Cap, although he might catch cold: When this Prelate perceived that by this means his Affairs went rather back∣bard than forward, he bethought himself of another course, prefers himself, and takes upon him, not like a Converter, but Persecutor; in causing the Hugonots of his Diocess to be tormented, and those of all <HI>France</HI> by his wicked Coun∣sel, hoping thereby to curry favour with the Pope, and re∣gain his credit by his zeal and forwardness for the propaga∣tion of Religion. But his Holiness, who hath abundance of reason, and whose disposition is not violent, whose in∣tent and meaning is, that Conversions should be effected by Reason, by good Examples; not by Dragoons and Rackings, and by an Holy Life, which is not consistant with the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who is taken with the Female Sex, and
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>love their Company: This change of shapes procured him but ill will and disdain; he had no share in the last promo∣tion, nor never will so long as <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. lives, nor per∣haps after him; when of necessity there will happen great changes at <HI>Rome:</HI> In the mean time Mounsieur <HI>Camus,</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Grenoble</HI> (whose unblameable Life and Conversati∣on might serve for a Mirrour to a many of your Court Bi∣shops) hath been honoured with the Purple without ever seeking for it, without persecuting any body, nor so much as suffering it within his Diocess; this Prelate being not <HI>a-la-mode de la Court,</HI> this new Dignity he so lately recei∣ved, cannot choose but be a great heart-burning to the King, and greater to the Arch-bishop, to see himself shut out of doors? Last of all, Can a Man more visibly cross the Popes behaviour, than the King doth at present in respect of the Franchises of his Embassador's Quarters, which served only for a Sanctuary for Robbers, Bankrupts, and several Assassinates; nay, more to fill the Embassador's, or his me∣nial Servants Purses? Although the Pope be Master in his own House, yet he hath had the prudence to expect the death of the Count <HI>Destrees,</HI> Embassadour; and the depar∣ture of the Embassador of <HI>Spain;</HI> yet what a clutter make they at the <HI>French</HI> Court about the regulation the Pope makes for security of his Subjects, and the quiet of his Ca∣pital City? I would fain know if the Pope intermeddles with what the King doth at <HI>Paris,</HI> or whether he did think it convenient, to speak against the Effigies of the King; which they have placed now in his Life-time, in the middle of Four Lanterns, in the place <HI>de Victor,</HI> with leud Inscrip∣tions, to which the Magistracy and Regiments of Guards did Obeysance, and Honoured as the King himself, even so far as to make Speeches to it. I would have any body sa∣tisfie me how the King would have taken their bare re∣monstrances
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>of the Pope; without doubt he would have answered him, that he might meddle with his own business, and that every one is Master of his own. When his Holi∣ness not approving the King's too familiar acquaintance with Madam <HI>de Montespan,</HI> and correspondence with Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> when he signified to the General of the Je∣suits, that he was much surprized, that Father <HI>La Chaize</HI> made no more of giving him absolution, the King appea∣red to be very much dissatisfied therewith; and said, he was bound to give an account to no body of his Acti∣ons. Why did he cause his Embassador to make his En∣trance as it were, with Sword in hand: All this doth make the temper of <HI>France</HI> to appear, which would domineer eve∣ry where over all, even over the Altar it self.</P>
<P>But let the King make what noise he will, as these Franchi∣ses bring him no profit, so there would be some way found out to pacifie all things, if his Holiness would grant a Di∣spensation for a Marriage of the Eldest Son of the Church to a Daughter of <HI>Rome,</HI> (I mean the City of <HI>Liege</HI>) I would say, by means of a Bull for the Cardinal of <HI>Furstenburg,</HI> in case he could get himself elected Coadjutor to the Arch-bi∣shop of <HI>Cologne,</HI> not being in a capacity to be Arch-bishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> himself; to avoid falling under the same Circum∣stances that the aforesaid Arch-bishop did upon the account of the Bishoprick of <HI>Munster,</HI> for which he never could ob∣tain a Bull, how instant soever the solicitations have been by the late Embassador of <HI>France</HI> for obtaining the same; but it is enough for the <HI>French</HI> King, since no body at present can be admitted to it; who is averse to his Interests. Now if <HI>Fustenburg</HI> that <HI>Mercury</HI> of <HI>France</HI> should chance to be so dignified, it is odds, but that the zeal for his Master and Benefactor would be augmented, and that nothing but this Temper and Policy of <HI>France</HI> would Reign, by reason
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>of him throughout the Electoral Dominions; nay, an hun∣dred to one, but the King who would have a Garrison in the Fortress, would become Absolute Master. But 'tis to be hoped, that for the benefit of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Church, that his Holiness will never make such a false step, so con∣trary to his own Interests, and to all Christian People, as to grant these Bulls to Cardinal <HI>Furstenburg:</HI> We all know very well, if once the King could be without the Pope, he could save himself the trouble of going to <HI>Rome,</HI> and could constitute and establish a Patriarch in <HI>France,</HI> after the man∣ner of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> no question he would do it, considering what was resolved on these few years last past by the <HI>French</HI> Clergy: There would be a two-fold advantage by it; the Mony that is carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> would not go out of <HI>France;</HI> the Patriarch would grant him whatsoever he should re∣quire (as Parliaments do at present) were it even a Dispen∣sation to marry the Princess of <HI>Conty.</HI> But he cannot shake off the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> besides, the Jesuits would be upon his back, if he should not appoint Father <HI>La Chaize,</HI> or some one of their Society, Patriarch. On the other hand, those Bishops that aspire to be Cardinals, would not be well pleased with this new invention, except the Arch-bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who could have some pretence to this Dignity; who in plain terms doth already say, That the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> since <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, till <HI>Charles</HI> II. have done well enough without <HI>Rome;</HI> besides, what the Northern Kings do at this time. That which makes the <HI>French</HI> King temporize so much, is, by reason he knows Popes are not as the King is said to be in the Inscription, <HI>viro immortali;</HI> that next after this Pope there may come another, who perhaps may not prove so honest a Man, yet may comply more with the El∣dest Son of the Church; but new Lords, new Laws: Death may as well crush, and bring down diseased Kings, as crazy
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>Popes. Be sure you may expect to see this politick Humour of <HI>France</HI> within a little while cock up in <HI>Avignon,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Venessin,</HI> as much as we see it at this day in <HI>Metz, Sedam, Franch Conte, Burgundy, Dombes,</HI> and last of all in the Principality of <HI>Orange.</HI> The King hath the same right of re-Union, convenience of Scituation over <HI>Avignon,</HI> and the County <HI>Venessin,</HI> as he hath over all the other Territo∣ries, I have but just named; for Q. <HI>Jane</HI> could not alienate the Crown-Lands to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> V. so that the Popes to disburse Thirty Thousand Florens to keep it, signifies no∣thing. The Country of <HI>Venessin</HI> was taken from the Count <HI>de St. Gille,</HI> so that albeit the Holy Sea had had the posses∣sion of these two places for some years; yet be sure the King will one of these days find an opportunity, whether by breeding a Quarrel, or otherwise to get it into his Clutches: That once done, the Pope may cry out long enough, he will be in a fair way, if he hold not his Tongue to make his Son send some Troops against St. <HI>Peter,</HI> as hath been done not long ago; and if ever the <HI>French</HI> King make himself Master of <HI>Spain,</HI> as he pretends by right so to be, after the decease of <HI>Charles</HI> now Reigning; the Pope must not think that his Rights will be better preserved at that time in <HI>Spain,</HI> than they be now in <HI>France,</HI> and the Dignity of <HI>Exarchat</HI> of <HI>Ra∣venna,</HI> which <HI>Pepin</HI> granted to the Holy See, would soon change its Master, and who can tell whether <HI>Rome</HI> it self would be exempted, so soon as ever the Pope should begin to speak of Excommunication, the King would speak of a Patriarch, insomuch that the Pope ought not to flatter him∣self that the politick disposition of <HI>France</HI> will truckle to the Holy See, nor to make an estimate of the King, how much a Catholick he is by the Persecution he raises against the Hugonots within his own Realms and Dominions, and else∣where; he knows well enough what he doth: If he perse∣cutes
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>them with one hand, he helps them with the other, he knows how to bring the <HI>Turk</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> when he sup∣poseth them fit for his Designs and Interests against the Em∣pire; when he thinks they may be serviceable to him as as∣sistants in advancing him to the Throne of <HI>Europe,</HI> to which our Great King hath confined his Ambition: But it often happens that Man purposes, but God disposes. <HI>France</HI> would have you believe her true-hearted and real, that the Holy See, and every body besides should of her Ambiti∣on make an Article of their Creed: Let her do and say what she pleases; I do not for all that believe, that if so be Faith and Truth were lost, that any one would go look to find it in <HI>France:</HI> All her by-past Actions do but too much be∣speak her, not to be any longer honest, and that Faith cannot agree with the King's Humour; so that a Prince fail∣ing in that, the Holy Father ought to beware of him; he is a close Enemy, counterfeiting the <HI>Devoto;</HI> a whited Sepul∣chre that dazles the Eyes of those who approach him: He is an <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who charms Christendom by his kind promi∣ses and noise of his <HI>Louises dor,</HI> but within he is a very sink of Falshood, insatiable Ambition, of unparallel'd Covetous∣ness, and of barbarous Cruelty; from whose Cruelty, and out of whose Hands the Church should put it into their Litany, Good Lord, deliver us, for fear they Christians fall into the same miseries that the <HI>Jews</HI> did in the time of <HI>Antiochus</HI> the Illustrious.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="16"/>the Empire on <HI>Ferdinand</HI> his Brother, and <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI> his Son: I must needs confess that these are two Twins, so nearly related to each other by Blood, by Alliances, and common Interests, that one will have much ado to touch the one, without offending the other; or destroy the one, without debilitating and reducing the other to the utmost extremity: This House hath evermore held up her Head against <HI>France;</HI> she alwayes counterpoized with <HI>France</HI> the Empire of the World: <HI>Spain</HI> took from <HI>Antony</HI> of <HI>Bourbon</HI> King of <HI>Navar,</HI> the Kingdom he had acquired by his Mar∣riage with <HI>Jane De Albret,</HI> Heiress of <HI>Navar;</HI> so that 'tis easie to suppose, that at present the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> being exalted to the Throne of <HI>France</HI> since <HI>Henry</HI> IV. time, may be from its Cradle Enemy to the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> and if she could de-Throne both of them, no question she would with all her heart get into their place if she could, and there∣by joyn the Empire to <HI>France, France</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countreys;</HI> and then by and by very easily ascend to the Universal Monarchy of all <HI>Europe:</HI> If this project don't succeed, 'tis at leastwise the intent and purpose of the <HI>French</HI> Politick Spirit, and what <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. drives at; who was not far from effecting it, when <HI>Vienna</HI> look't upon her self near destruction, and an hundred to one but had fallen into the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Chains: Scarce any one is ignorant of the Correspondence the King of <HI>France</HI> holds with the <HI>Ottoman Port,</HI> that it was upon his intreaty that the Grand Seigniour first violated the Truce concluded with the Emperour, that he might second and abet Count <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Designs, whom <HI>France</HI> assisted with Money and Counsel. The Emperour and his Council knows better than any body the occasion that moved the <HI>Port</HI> to send back Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> together with the Propositions of Peace he brought along with him. The Marquiss <HI>D'Seppeville,</HI> Embassador of <HI>France,</HI> failed
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>not with all expedition to send one Courier after another to his Master to give him notice thereof; who failed not forthwith to dispatch a Person to the Grand Visier, to ob∣lige him to persist in his Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> he laying before him that his Honour was ingaged, that the City was at the last gasp, that it stood him upon to take it at what rate soever for his own Reputations sake, and good of the <HI>Port;</HI> that this Siege having made such a noise in the World, he could not quit it, but with Eternal Infamy to the <HI>Ottaman</HI> Empire and Grand Visier, and for the better facilitating the taking of it, and to divide the Armies of the Empire, he was about to enter into <HI>Flanders</HI> with a powerful Army, which would undoubtedly force the Empire to recal his For∣ces to defend themselves; and the King did effectually make good his promise; for he entered of late years as we see into <HI>Flanders,</HI> burning, pillaging, and taking all before him after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, imitating therein his Allie, whom he was so forward to serve and second; and the King di∣vesting himself of the Title of Most Christian, took upon him that of his Friend, and Allie the Grand Sultan; for pla∣ces that ought to be most sacred to Christians, and the re∣tirements of the Nuns fared no better: Several Virgins suf∣fered Martyrdom by a Violation never before heard of in Christendom: But all this did much contribute to the King's Design, and the <HI>French</HI> Policy obtained its wish; there was Forty Thousand Men just ready in <HI>Alsatia</HI> to pour into <HI>Germany,</HI> to make himself be declared Emperour at the Head of this Army: His Manifestoes were already in print, ready to be spread abroad; that to prevent Christianity from falling into Slavery, he was forced to withstand it by a powerful Army, and by declaring himself Emperour to hold the Reins of the Empire, to defend it, as serving as a boun∣dary to <HI>France,</HI> and to <HI>Europe</HI> it self; considering the inca∣pacity
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>of the Emperour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the King knew what he said when he tells us the Emperour was not fit to Reign: Without all question, had <HI>Vienna</HI> been taken, the Princes and Electors would have had recourse to him, and been of his side, for their own preservation; being the only Prince who had Forces ready, and who at that juncture was capa∣ble to retard the progress of the Infidels. But <HI>Vienna</HI> being relieved, we saw then the truth of what I have alledged, that their Spirit came down, and they became crest-fallen, they cared not to joyn in the common joy of all the Uni∣verse, which could not sufficiently praise God for this Signal Victory, by their Bone-fires, and <HI>Te Deums,</HI> wherewith the Air echoed again: None but <HI>France</HI> stood mute, and who forbid divers Church-men to give thanks for the same, upon pain of incurring the high displeasure of the most Christian King. Here you may perceive what Spirit <HI>France</HI> is of, in relation to the Emperour; who, that it might have an opportunity to keep him under, and throw him down from his Throne, and so take his place; The King of <HI>France</HI> heartily wishes that <HI>Vienna</HI> might sall into the hands of the <HI>Mahometans:</HI> But as our Thoughts are not as Gods Thoughts, so this King of Kings has disposed of things otherwise; who by vouchsafing such grand Victories to the Christian Forces, <HI>France</HI> must be fain to change their Bat∣teries and Assaults. We hope also that the Emperours Council will stand better upon their Guard, and appear more vigilant than they have been hitherto; and that they will remove from <HI>France</HI> all means to pry into their under∣takings; yea, even into their Closet-secrets: For 'tis well known what courses they have taken to make the Resoluti∣ons be changed and falsified, when they were not relished by the King, nor for his Interest; and that the Emperour could neither speak, consult, write, nor so much as make
<PB N="31" REF="17"/>least proceeding, but it was presently penetrated, diverted another way, incumbred, watched and observed; and by the Jesuits good leave they are accused of having had a great stroak in all these Affairs; they always take the stronger side, expecting a change. No body can be igno∣rant but that the mis-understanding that arose between the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and <HI>Monticuculi,</HI> General of the Im∣perial Forces, during the <HI>Holland</HI> War; was occasion'd by the cunning contrivance of the Jesuite changing the Em∣perours Order, to ingage <HI>Turrene</HI> with <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> in the counterfeit Order not to engage; which gave opportunity to the <HI>French</HI> Army to retreat; which was in very great danger to have made their Graves there, if it had been at∣tacked by two so good Parties, being reduced to its last legs through sicknesses, running away from their Colours, and a Mortality amongst them.</P>
<P>Then again, At the Battel at <HI>Sennif, Souches</HI> excuseth him∣self, that he could not make the on-set for want of Or∣ders; this was hammered upon the same Anvil: Yet we hope that Affairs changing their Face, the Reverend Fathers the Jesuits will have better thoughts of the Empire. I have much ado to omit two Affairs which happened during the Emperors last Rupture with the King; one is the busi∣ness of General <HI>Capelliers</HI> Steward of his Houshold; who carryed on a correspondence with the <HI>French</HI> Embassadors, and gave them a full account of whatsoever past at home in his Masters House, that came to his hearing, or knowledge; the Letters of all the Matter were intercepted at the Post∣house in <HI>Frankfort;</HI> this Traytor indeed was clapt up, but the Jesuits who at that bout had taken too large a Dose of Spirit Gall, knew well enongh how to make him come of, lest he should make a Discovery of some others. During the Siege of <HI>Philipsburg</HI> by the Imperial Forces, did not
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>these good Men prevail with two Merchants to send in a supply of Powder, but that Mine was sprung, and vanisht in smoak; the business was found out, and the Jesuits brought it so about, that the undertakers were not punish∣ed, for fear lest they should make farther Discoveries; I tell you this for truth; for one of these Persons was one of my Acquaintance, who told it me with his own mouth, that they came to fetch him as far as from <HI>Paris,</HI> where he was settled, to get him to do this business: You may see by this, that the Spirit of <HI>France</HI> animates a great many Bodies, actuates them strangely; and that those in whom his Impe∣rial Majesty puts most confidence, are not always faithful to him. When <HI>France</HI> carried on a design under-hand to in∣duce the Emperour to bestow his two Sisters upon two Prin∣ces dispossest of their Inheritance; it was not with an in∣tent that businesses should succeed in this manner as we see they do at this day; for we cannot deny but that <HI>Lorrain</HI> is the Restorer of the Empire, an <HI>Hero</HI> of so many Great and Glorious Victories, the Subduer of so many Provinces, who will make the Grand Seigniour not only sue to him for Peace, as he doth already, but to grant whatsoever one demands of him to save his Head from the riot and fury of the Rabble, who will be sure to do it, if he conclude not a Peace, or a Cessation of Arms, and that speedily. But this Spirit of <HI>France</HI> had its aims; that is to say, by getting some body to counsel the Emperour to bestow his two Sisters on two Princes in the forementioned Circumstances, who de∣spaired of recovering their Estates but by a Peace; they would alwayes incline the Emperour to listen thereto, not∣withstanding his Imperial Majesty might not have that ad∣vantage by it that might be expected; in hopes there might be some Article in it favourable to them, restoring them to their Estates by this Peace. The truth is, that hath been
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>very successful to the one, as for the other, it is to be hoped, that he will open himself a passage to his Fortune by his Vi∣ctorious Sword: 'Tis most certain that the misunderstanding which hath reigned between Prince <HI>Harman</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> Pre∣sident of the Imperial Council, and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> be∣tween the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Emperour, are nothing but Eggs which <HI>France</HI> sits and hatches. The Marquiss <HI>De Bethune</HI> is too well verst in the way to <HI>Poland;</HI> and his Si∣ster hath still a <HI>French</HI> Soul, though Queen of that Kingdom. The kindnesses the King of <HI>France</HI> has done her Children, are faithful, and living Witnesses, and the transmitments that have past through the hands of the Bankers of <HI>Hamburg</HI> and <HI>Dantzik</HI> are like so many rayes of that great Sun of <HI>France,</HI> which disperseth his Light into a great many Courts. The Emperour cannot ignore that Itch of theirs is an old Distemper the Kings of <HI>France</HI> have so long been troubled with; they long to be mounting the Imperial Throne, be∣cause it is one step to the Universal; or at least, to the Monarchy of <HI>Europe. Henry</HI> II. made them draw him out the Model after what manner the <HI>Romans</HI> cut out their way through <HI>Italy;</HI> but those Countreys have ever been <HI>Caemite∣rium Gallorum,</HI> and fatal to their Enterprises. In like man∣ner <HI>Duplessis</HI> gave advice to <HI>Charles</HI> IX. never to venture up∣on <HI>Italy,</HI> but upon the <HI>Netherlands. Lewis</HI> XIV. is much of his mind, as shall appear by the sequel of the Story. Af∣ter the Death of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> III. did not the <HI>French</HI> King use his utmost endeavours to re-ascend the Throne of <HI>Charle∣main;</HI> he spared not to send into all the Courts of the Ele∣ctors to procure their Votes; and such who were great with these Princes, did their business for them; for <HI>France</HI> is free-natur'd enough, when any one is to be brought over to their Party: One of the visible demonstrations of the Kings designs is, that he caused an Eagle to be put upon his
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>Money just above the Head of his Effigies; and that he speaks his mind freely, but much more haughtily, that the Empire hath been long enough in the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and that it is high time it should return to his again; and that was just upon the <HI>Turks</HI> coming into <HI>Germany,</HI> in the year 1683. But Man purposeth, God disposeth: All the wise projects and contrivances of Men are but folly before God, who doth not guide the Oeconomy of the Universe accor∣ding to the ambition of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great: Now because this King knows very well that the Electors may prove a great obstacle to his design upon the Empire if they have a mind to be cross; therefore he makes much of some, threatens others. The <HI>Dolphin</HI> of <HI>Frances</HI> Marriage concluded with the Princess of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> was a bait to draw in the Prince of that Family to the King's Interest, and so inspire his Body with a <HI>French</HI> Spirit: That Pension the King allowed him for some time made him much in the Kings Books, and devoted to his Interest; nay, over and above the Marriage every one was in the mind that this Prince would be perpetually devoted to his Benefactor; but the unbecoming unworthy Matches that <HI>France</HI> offered this Prince, made his Ministers look about them; who knew so well how to disabuse him, that he alter'd his mind, and tack't about to the better and more glorious side, whether we consider it in respect of the Marriage he contracted with the Emperours Daughter, or by the Lawrels he won in <HI>Hungary.</HI> This is a thing he durst not so much as have dreamt of, if he had remained in the <HI>French</HI> Interest; because the Conquests of the Imperial Army did not at all correspond with the Kings designs, as we told you before: No sooner had Mounsieur <HI>Baviere</HI> for∣saken the <HI>French</HI> Party, but the King to comfort himself up for that loss, entering <HI>Madam la Dauphines</HI> Chamber, told her that he just came from winning Eight Hundred Thou∣sand
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>Crowns of her Brother. We all know how the Ele∣ctor of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> is beset on all sides with the Emissaries of <HI>France,</HI> and how the chief persons of his Court, which discretion makes me forbear mentioning, have taken but too large a Dose of that same <HI>Spirit Gall;</HI> so that there is nothing transacted in the Electors Court, but the <HI>French</HI> Envoy hath presently notice of it, and by Mounsieur <HI>de Rebenack</HI>'s good leave, Men are sufficiently informed of all his Intrigues, of all the Presents he bestows; if it were less secret, one might not perchance know it; but he wanting the retentive faculty to keep his own Counsel, he must give others leave to disclose it, who are not so much concern'd to keep a secret. If the late Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> had been surer to the <HI>French</HI> Interest than he was, perhaps he might have been alive to this day: Well, I know the <HI>French</HI> Envoy had not an hand in the fact, but did suggest and promote it: I know that the Prince Elector is not ignorant neither, whence the Distemper proceeds; he hath reason to coun∣termine them, and stand upon his Guard; but I could wish, he may not be too slow, and that he shut not the Stable door when the Horse is stoln. If so be the Elector of <HI>Bran∣denburg</HI> had an insight into his real true Interest and Forces; could but get rid once of these <HI>French</HI> Spirits that encom∣pass her; he might safely say he was one of the most pu∣issant Princes of the North, make others dread and stand in awe of him: Be sure which way soever he takes, he casts the scales, <HI>France</HI> knows it very well too, and that's the reason why they court him so much: Let him but stand Neuter, and espouse no Cause, she is satisfied. The Per∣secution of the Protestants of <HI>France</HI> had in a manner open∣ed the eyes of the Elector; yet Mounsieur <HI>de Rebenack,</HI> backt by Mounsieur <HI>D'espense,</HI> managed things so finely, that people gave more credit to what they said, than to so
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>many thousand Witnesses that arrived dayly at <HI>Berlin.</HI> This i'le say, that the Elector hath this benefit, that all those that flie to him for refuge, people his Country: But <HI>France</HI> out of spite to thwart his designs to make the Electorship fall after the Decease of <HI>Frederick William</HI> to some Prince or other, who will be more favourable to him, than those who were born by the Princess <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> and <HI>Orange;</HI> and there is all the probability imaginable she will accom∣plish her designs in this matter; at leastwise they are in a fair way towards it, if God Almighty do not prevent it, by preserving the Prince Elector alive, to whom he may give Issue.</P>
<P>As for the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> when <HI>France</HI> mediated a match between the Princess, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans;</HI> she had two things in her eye; the first was there∣by together with a Pension to allure the late Prince Elector into her Interests; not being able to do that, he might evermore devise pretensions for the Right of Madam of <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>After that we know but too well how the Electors <HI>Pala∣tines</HI> Father and Son were treated by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. how the <HI>Palatinate</HI> hath been trodden under foot by his Troops and the people of that Country ruin'd and laid waste: But last of all Death having deprived the World of these two Princes in a short time without Male Issue; and seeing that at present the <HI>Palatinate</HI> is fallen to the House of <HI>Newburg,</HI> (pursuant to a Treaty with the Emperour to that purpose) the King of <HI>France</HI> is perswaded there is no other resolution to take with the Elector now Reigning, that he is too near an Allie to the Emperour (to whom he is beholden for what he hath) ever to abandon his Interests, or quit his Party; so that it is not thereabouts neither, that <HI>France</HI> attacks it, the pretenses of Madams Rights are now in debate: The
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>Popes medling in the matter signifies nothing; the business is not ripe; it is a Gate <HI>France</HI> keeps open, for to enter into <HI>Germany</HI> by; and all the delayes the Pope obtains do but keep off the Distemper a little longer, and do not cure it; and you shall see the next Spring (if any change happen in <HI>Europe, France</HI> will enter thereinto with Fire and Sword, as she uses to do. All the Elector must wish for is, that Peace may be concluded between the two Emperours this Winter, that the Death of a Prince hapning, his success may afford work enough to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great somewhere else: Now these seem to be the only means how this Elector may avoid falling into the clutches of <HI>France;</HI> and this reason ought much to sway with the Emperour, and be a principal mo∣tive to him to make a Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> as he may now do very advantagiously: For he must know, that if ever the <HI>French</HI> King break the Ice, and gets footing in <HI>Germany;</HI> he will never return back: The <HI>French</HI> are very insolent and domineering, especially at the first heat, and in prospe∣rity; and provided Fortune smiles upon them at the begin∣ning, and in their first furie; wherewith they undertake all Exploits, that is a great incitement to them to drive on farther and farther, and then peace with the <HI>Turk</HI> not being made, I cannot tell whether the Emperour will be ever able to make it, if he would never so fain, at lest upon the same Terms and Conditions they offer him at this time.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> never made much account of all the proposals of <HI>France:</HI> He is a Prince that doth not stu∣dy all those cunning niceties and tricks that a great many other Courts are full of, but one who being well verst in what is good for himself, pursues it, without disputing, or making more ado: Now that's your best Policy which suc∣ceeds the best; wherefore <HI>France</HI> seeing he would not swal∣low the hook, breeds abundance of trouble in his Family,
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>and sets him at variance with his Neighbours, against which the Emperours Council hath made seasonable provision, which makes the Spirit of <HI>France</HI> that it becomes not so fami∣liar in that Court, for their <HI>Ducatoons</HI> are better beloved than <HI>Lewisses:</HI> But to know what it done there, thither is sent such Persons who have skill to comply and conform to the humour of the Country, and more especially to quaff stout∣ly, and by that means render themselves fit Companions at Table; they must be of strong Constitution to bear Wine; there they may get acquaintance, make themselves familiar, and make bold to skip their Glasses. So likewise at the <HI>French</HI> Court, when an Envoy or Resident is to be sent to the Court of <HI>Saxony;</HI> they inquire in the first place whe∣ther he can hold out well at drinking, that's one Qualifica∣tion, together with couzening, that is requisite.</P>
<P>As for the Electors of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Metz,</HI> as <HI>France</HI> are not afraid of them, as not being Princes that are capable of doing much mischief, so they let them alone till time serves; for she knows that standing in need of them, she will be able to attract them by the sweet charmes of her golden rayes; if not, she will proceed to threatnings, and thereby make her do what she pleases. The King needs no more but send his Forces to <HI>Triers,</HI> he hath reduc't it to such a condition as not to be in a capacity to dispute his entrance, and so he can make himself Master of it, when he thinks fit.</P>
<P>As for the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> we all know what mettle he is made of; that he's a Prince that loves a quiet Life, and desiring to end his dayes in peace; gives himself wholly up to his Devotions, to work out his Salvation; this design being alwayes commendable in a Prelate, and a Person of his Character. But a mild peaceable disposition doth no wayes agree with that of <HI>France,</HI> which is turbulent, boy∣sterous,
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>and would alwayes be in action: Now here is the reason why they have given the Arch-bishop a chip of the old block, who hath a good stock of the <HI>French</HI> Spirit: I mean the Cardinal Bishop of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> who is as vio∣lent, and as great a cheat, as he that animates him; nevertheless this Bishop hath got the art so well, to influence the mind of the Arch-bishop, that he rules him with an absolute sway, and by means of the Bishoprick of <HI>Munster,</HI> which <HI>France</HI> procured him with Two Millions of Crowns, cannot handsomly turn tail at present. I know the Pope upon very just considerations hath not been wil∣ling to dispatch the Bull hitherto; yet it is enough for <HI>France,</HI> that by this Election, during the Electors Life; the Chapter dare never let it enter into their thoughts, much less supply the place; so that <HI>France</HI> is sure that no one Prelate of a contrary party, shall ever be admitted to that dignity, and that sufficeth. How many Bishops are there in <HI>France</HI> without Bulls, who notwithstanding perform the Functions of their place, and enjoy the benefits of their Bishopricks. The Pope cannot live for ever, and the King will be sure to keep the Gate open, and High-wayes clear; that after the Arch-bishops decease, some other Emissary of <HI>France</HI> may come in at the same Golden Gate: This Bishoprick being of great consequence as himself did acknowledge it to be in the year 1672. I told you that the Bishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> would have much ado to free himself from the <HI>French</HI> Interest, the King having taken care for that beforehand, in case of a change; and all that was done at <HI>Liege,</HI> was but a cunning stratagem, and that through the suggestion of that Prince, to foment mis-understanding between them, and to set be∣fore the Citizens of <HI>Liege</HI> the Idea of their discontent, by rea∣son of the Cittadel which they have again raised, whereof <HI>France</HI> is too much a Master, that will occasion the Arch-bi∣shop
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>of <HI>Cologns</HI> Repentance, at least that of his Successor after him, in case they begin to waver: Men were in sus∣pense at that time concerning who should succeed him; for <HI>France</HI> saw at a distance, and she supposed by all that had past, that she might be able to prevail with the Chapter of <HI>Liege,</HI> to confer the Coadjutorship of the Principality and Bishoprick of <HI>Liege</HI> upon Cardinal <HI>Furstenburg;</HI> but those that composed the Chapter better advised than any one durst have believed or hoped for, had no mind to swallow the bait, but laught at it, which made him have recourse to the Chapter of <HI>Cologne,</HI> where he hath had better success, and notwithstanding all the opposition the Pope and Em∣perour made; they went farther, and the Cardinal hath obtained what <HI>France</HI> demanded: They have been long about this business, and immediately upon Mens saying, That the Cannons knew what Gold was. <HI>France</HI> progno∣sticated nothing but good to her self, and found the Road to <HI>Cologne</HI> easier than to <HI>Munster.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> and the Cardinal know very well that the Pope will not give his Bull for it; but they may have the same comfort in that as they had for <HI>Munster,</HI> they will do well enough without it, no body besides being capable of pre∣tending to it; and as I told you the Pope being aged, may chance to dye, and another more easie Man may succeed him.</P>
<P>Now then by what we see come to pass by the procee∣dings of the Policy of <HI>France:</HI> Have I not great reason to say that the whole Empire, Electors, and other Kings, Princes, and States have great cause to with∣stand the designs of <HI>Leuis</HI> XIV. to prevent his rising to an Empire for fear of becoming his Slaves, whereas at present he takes special care of some, and caresses them; he will then Lord it over them, he will put off the Foxes skin, and
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>put on the Lyons again; they'l talk of nothing then, but of <HI>tel est mon bon plaisir,</HI> such my Will and Pleasure is. Nothing but a Peace with the <HI>Turk</HI> can hinder him from growing Great; nothing but that can put the Emperour in a condition to oppose it. The King will be very cautious how he makes his limits at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> during these Contests that give him an opportunity to build Fortresses, to defend what he shall usurp; as we see he hath done but too much already: It will be requisite to have an Army to drive him out thence. Have not we seen in the time of peace what the Spirit of <HI>France</HI> is capable of doing: 'Tis known, that amongst other good qualities, he is indued with the admi∣rable gift of Usurping well, finds always reasons for the doing so; which he would have all Men receive for Articles of their Creed, as well as the just pretentions of the King upon the Empire, treated at large in a little Book, wherein the Wit of one called <HI>Aubri</HI> (Advocate in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI>) hath been exercised? But the King of <HI>France</HI> his Manifesto published newly at <HI>Ratis∣bone</HI> and other States of the Empire, to maintain the Usur∣ping Fortification of <HI>Tarbrack,</HI> deserves to be inserted in this Book, to let these who have not yet seen it, understand the slender Reasons he alledges to palliate his infraction of the last Truce. Behold here what his Minister hath-published to all the World.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The King having been informed of the complaints which the Ministers of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> make upon the account of some outrages committed at <HI>Tarbrack</HI> by his Majesties Order, who throughout the Empire they charge with acting contrary, and call him an infringer of the Treaty concluded in the Year of our Lord, 1684.</Q> The which hath obliged his said Majesty to issue out Or∣ders to the Count <HI>de Crecy,</HI> his Envoy Extraordinary, and
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>Plenipotentiary at the Imperial Diet at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to repre∣sent to the Ministers of the Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire assembled in the said place, the small ground there is for such a complaint in it self, and the just occasions they administer to all those who have a desire to preserve the publick peace; to believe that this is a pretence that they are willing to make use of to disturb the same peace and quiet.</P>
<P>First of all, If it may be said upon good grounds that that Treaty ratified at <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> may not properly be called a Truce, its true definition being only a forbearance or sufferance, by vertue of which (although the War be still in being) we are to forbear all Acts of Hostility; there being at that time no rupture between <HI>France</HI> and the Em∣pire; this tolleration may be lookt upon as a mutual promise of a good understanding and Union for the space of Twen∣ty years; in consideration whereof the Emperour and Em∣pire on the one part, are to lay aside, during the said term, their Soveraignty, Rights, Superiority, and Protection, or all other pretences whatsoever they may have upon Lands, Places, or Towns fallen to <HI>France</HI> before the first of <HI>August,</HI> 1681. His Majesty in like manner binds himself not to make any farther suit or prosecution in the Empire during the said time. These are the most material Covenants, by which they interchangeably assure each other of a long continua∣tion of Friendship and good Intelligence; which afforded means to the Emperours Arme is to conquer all <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to put themselves and Empire in a posture, and in a condi∣tion to undertake a War, which otherwise would not have waged but at great cost and charges; and peradventure at the hazard and ruine of the Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire. But further to demonstrate this weak pre∣text, altogether not to be tenible, nor can hold Water of
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>it self, we need not run over the Articles of this Treaty, and though we might even look upon it as a Treaty barely con∣cluded only for the security of the tranquillity of the Em∣pire, and to procure for it the means whereby to imploy its Armies against the common Enemy; yet one cannot for all that prove that it may deprive the King of his Power to fortifie those places where his Majesty hath right so to do, as well by the possession he hath already had, as by the com∣mon consent of the Empire, granted by vertue of the same Treaty, nor that he cannot act in those places as he plea∣seth; you need only peruse all the Treaties of Truce which have been made hitherto, to see whether a prohibition of fortifying is not expresly included therein at such time as both Parties cannot agree. By this toleration of the Truce of <HI>Bonvise</HI> in the year of our Lord 1537, 'tis said, that whilst the Cessation of Arms lasts in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> King <HI>Francis</HI> I. could not send any Forces into the County of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> nor there raise any Fortification: This Excepti∣on gives us sufficiently to understand, that the King was impowered to fortifie his places thereabouts, and else∣where, during the said Truce; so that they were bound to insert a clause into this Treaty, to deprive <HI>France</HI> of this Liberty in the County of St. <HI>Paul</HI> only.</P>
<P>The General Truce that was agreed upon at <HI>Nice,</HI> in the Year 1538, ratifies and confirms this same Article concer∣ning St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but it doth no way hinder the two Princes to cause Fortifications to be raised any where else.</P>
<P>The Cessation made in 1555, makes no mention of this point, but the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>States General</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Netherlands</HI> upon their concluding a Truce in 1609, having a mind indeed to deprive each other of having the liberty of raising any new Fortress in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> inserted this Clause; <HI>There shall be on neither side any
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>Fortress in the</HI> Low Countreys <HI>during the Cessation.</HI></P>
<P>When the Peace was in agitation at <HI>Munster</HI> between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> that they demurr'd longest upon and proved the greatest obstacle to the conclusion, was, that the Catholick King could not find in his heart to quit his claim to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> which caused them to agree upon a Truce for Thirty years for that Province alone; during which term both Kings should keep what he possest at that time; but another difficulty emerg'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not endure that they should fortifie during the Truce; those places in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to which the <HI>French</HI> would not agree, alledging it unjust, upon this account that thereby this would put them in a posture of being Defendants only, and not Aggressors, which was permitted in all Ages, they would not so much as admit of the Expedient offered by the Em∣bassador of the <HI>States General.</HI> The same case stands good now, as to the present Treaty. Every one knows that the prohibitions to raise Fortifications propounded by the Mini∣sters of the Empire, in the Ninth and Tenth Articles of the same project of the Empire, and what was then and there in∣terchangeably delivered by publick Writing, was interjected by <HI>France:</HI> Besides, the Imperial Ministers would by no means give their consent that the Emperour should yield up to the King such places whereof he was in present possession, which his Majesty would not have medled with, nor limi∣ted, nor encroached upon. The Emperours Ministers not able to make good this demand, gave it over. 'Tis hard to believe that the Imperial Ministers will draw any Argu∣ments to be a sufficient ground of complaint from the Eighth and Ninth Article of the Truce; forasmuch as the former contains only the settling the Lands upon the Proprietors again, who would take the Oath of Allegiance for them: The Soveraignty whereof was delivered to his Majesty. The other is, that his said Majesty shall permit the Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>to have the free Exercise of their Religion. Moreover the re-union of <HI>Tarbrack</HI> having been irrecoverably ad∣judged by a decree of the Royal Chamber of <HI>Metz</HI> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1681. It is hard to conceive what Title the Imperial Ministers can pretend to in accusing <HI>France</HI> of acting contrary to the Cessation of Arms, especially the King giving visible and dayly demonstrations of the inviolable Observation of the least punctillio of them, helping and furthering what in him lies, the progress of the Imperial Forces against those <HI>Barbarians</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> through his moderation and complyance, and what administers ground of suspition concerning the designs of the Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> (which his Ministers do but too much lay open upon all occasions) is their not being desirous of keeping the Truce any longer than they may be strong enough to break it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, considering that this Truce hath offered to Christendom that happy Peace and Tranquillity it enjoys at this day; and hath supplyed means to the States and Circles of the Empire by their assistance to bring upon the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire all those mischiefs wherewith they threatned the Hereditary Countreys. We dare boldly and truly say, that the Emperour is beholding to him for the preservation of his Country, and for all those advantages he hath had over the <HI>Turks:</HI> His Ministers are as much to blame to complain that the King making use of his full power, hath caused his frontier places to be fortified, as standing in most need: Just as a Soveraign, for the security, repose, and prosperity of his Subjects, causeth the bounda∣ries of his Territories to be fortified; would, not by so doing, make us believe, that he had the least thought of siezing upon his Neighbours Countrey, or any mind to Commence a War, no more than any private Person busy∣ing himself in repairing the utmost Fences of his Lands to
<PB N="46" REF="25"/>make them good, would thereby give but small proof of his desire to entrench upon his Neighbours. But yet his Maje∣sty is not without hope but that the Wisdom and Prudence of the States of the Empire assembled at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> will se∣riously reflect upon the just suspitions which the ill-groun∣ded complaints of the Imperial Ministers have occasioned to him, and that they will bethink themselves of one way or other that the good Intelligence which his Majesty purpo∣seth to maintain with the Empire, may not be interrupted, nor impeded. <HI>Given at</HI> Fountainbleau, Octob. 22th 1687.</P>
<P>To hear this Manifesto, would not a Man judge that the Emperour is obliged to the King for all his Victories over the <HI>Turk,</HI> and without him the Empire had been quite lost, when all the World sees evidently by what we have said, that it was none but he that induced the Grand Seigniour to break the Truce, and to send relief to <HI>Tekely;</HI> but the Spi∣rit of <HI>France</HI> is always deceitful.</P>

<HEAD>The Policy of <HI>France,</HI> and the Maxims, in relation to <HI>Spain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRom the Empire I pass to <HI>Spain,</HI> which Kingdom and <HI>France</HI> have divided <HI>Europe</HI> between them some years last past; all other Princes have listed themselves under their Banner; thereafter as their Interest required, but the most part agreed in that point to support the weaker, and endea∣vour a just ballance between them. The late Mounsieur <HI>Sully,</HI> in a Letter to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. concerning the Quarrel with <HI>Spain,</HI> says that the least growth of Power in the one is lookt
<PB N="47" REF="25"/>upon to be a weakning and lessening of the other. Until <HI>Philip</HI> IV. time, <HI>Spain</HI> ever kept up its head, (though it began to decline in <HI>Philip</HI> the Seconds, by reason of the War in the <HI>Low Countreys</HI>) but ever since that, and particu∣larly after the last King <HI>Philip</HI> IV. Death, <HI>France</HI> got the upper hand, and <HI>Spain</HI> humbly submitted.</P>
<P>Upon the Festival of one of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> who was Sainted, the Preacher St. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> extolling the grandeur of his Mighty King in his Sermon, told 'em, that if his God was not God, the King <HI>Don Philip</HI> should be God; but I suppose something less than so, would satisfie his Successor, the case being altered since that. And yet <HI>Charles</HI> II. is King of <HI>Spain</HI> still, has the same <HI>Indies,</HI> and his Ships go thi∣ther, and come home laden with Gold and Silver as they us't to do heretofore; but still this <HI>Spain</HI> is not like that, which was once the Terrour of all Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> who were but justly jealous of her aspiring Greatness, and had reason to be Confederates against it for their common de∣fence: Now 'tis in the same condition that a Thief is, when he's brought to his last shifts, and just ready to be taken.</P>
<P>If <HI>Spain</HI> were not supported by its Allies, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. King of <HI>France</HI> would quickly be at <HI>Madrid:</HI> The <HI>Low Countries</HI> would bend under the <HI>French</HI> yoak, in less than one Cam∣paign, though 'twould be effected more easily, because their own Prince has no Children, and is very sickly, and though they see utter ruine coming upon them, yet they dare make no opposition, for they could only make sport for the in∣solent <HI>French</HI> Troops if they should, having no prospect of succours from any body that's able to rescue them. <HI>France</HI> knows all this well enough, and 'tis very true, that <HI>France</HI> waits only for a fit opportunity to take possession of the Queens Right in the Dauphin's Name, for the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> falls to the Female Sex, and it came to the House of
<PB N="48" REF="26"/><HI>Austria</HI> by a Woman, that is to say, by <HI>Jane, Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Spains</HI> Daughter, who married a Prince of that Family.</P>
<P>To let you see how much <HI>Spain</HI> suffers it self to be <HI>baffled</HI> by <HI>France,</HI> I need only shew you two Examples, which will convince you that I have said nothing but what is true. The King of <HI>France</HI> sent a Memorial to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the States of the United Provinces, to this effect: That if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should grant the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> or but make him Governour (as the report was when he married the Arch-dutchess) that she would then without more ado break off the peace, since neither of those things could be done without manifest in∣jury to the Dauphin's Right. Mr. <HI>Feuquier</HI> was the Man who gave the Memorial to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Count <HI>D'avaux</HI> to the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces;</HI> but were <HI>Paris</HI> over this, perhaps you'l say, that <HI>Spain</HI> did not consider it well, and they are so justly afraid of <HI>France,</HI> that it is no wonder if that puts 'em a little out of their Wits: But I am going to tell you a thing, which you'l own does sufficiently discover the weakness and poor Spirit of <HI>Spain;</HI> it hapned at the Ceremony of making an Entry into <HI>London,</HI> that the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Embassadors met: The Baron <HI>Watville</HI> went be∣fore <HI>Mounsieur d' Estrade, France</HI> presently complains of this indignity; and <HI>Spain</HI> was so pitifully mean, as to disown that brave Action of their Ambassador: Thus by that scanda∣lous procedure <HI>Spain</HI> suffered in its Honour, and gave place to <HI>France,</HI> though there was nothing like necessity for their doing it: I can see no other reason for't, but fear of <HI>Ca∣non Law,</HI> and dread of the Troops which <HI>France</HI> keeps up to inforce its Commands, which are just ready too, in case the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should dye suddenly. Let <HI>Charles</HI> II. take what care he can in settling the Succession, if he has re∣spect
<PB N="49" REF="26"/>for his own Family, and the last Will and intent of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. his Successor will have enough to do, and a scurvy War to maintain. The Queen, who is altogether <HI>French</HI> both by her Birth and Inclinations, has her Faction in the Kingdom, and when the King is dead, will much ra∣ther trust her <HI>Couzen-Germain,</HI> than a Prince who is a Stran∣ger, at least would be so, were it not for the Marriage, which will be a great strengthning to his Party. The Mar∣riages of the <HI>Infanta's</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> with Kings of <HI>France,</HI> have ever been the cause of great differences between the two Crowns, and very fatal to <HI>Spain;</HI> but the Marriage of <HI>Ma∣ria Theresia</HI> with <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. compleats the misery which is inevitably falling upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and how stifly soever the King of <HI>France</HI> may have denyed his designs, yet he never inten∣ded to keep either his Word or Oath as to that matter. We are sufficiently satisfied by the obstacles he puts, that the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty may not be registred in Parliament; as al∣so by his Manifesto's (which have run all the World over) of the Queen of <HI>France</HI>'s <HI>Just Pretentions.</HI> What good can <HI>Spain</HI> get by Marriages and Alliances with <HI>France?</HI> On the contrary very great Mischief, for 'tis by reason of the last Marriage that <HI>France</HI> layes claim to all this, the wiser <HI>Philip</HI> II. preferr'd the Arch-Duke <HI>Ernest,</HI> and afterward <HI>Albert.</HI> The Truce which <HI>France</HI> has now made, is design'd only to amuze and lull <HI>Spain</HI> and its Allies asleep: Thus to make them lay down their Arms, and in the mean time the <HI>French</HI> King has at least a Hundred and Fifty Thousand Men a foot, who dance up and down, sometimes towards <HI>Alsace,</HI> some∣time toward <HI>Cologne,</HI> and pretty often toward the <HI>Low Coun∣tries:</HI> All this is only to make them us'd to him, that so they may think he has no design upon them, and lay by all jealousie and suspition. But when he finds a good op∣portunity, you shall see him fall upon them, as a Hawk up∣on
<PB N="50" REF="27"/>her quarry, and carry them off too if he pleases; for what should hinder him, when there's not a Man in Arms, and by that time the Allies can be prepared, the King of <HI>France</HI> has done his business. Thus this Truce is only to bear in hand, and amuze the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> that they may not make War upon him, and that he may be constant∣ly in a condition to take possession of the <HI>Dauphins Right</HI> so soon as ever the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is dead, without any other legal Process, but that of <HI>Dragoon Law:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will find themselves miserably deluded in relying upon this Truce. 'Tis <HI>a broken reed which will pierce through their hands,</HI> and if unhappily, the Emperour should be still ingaged in a War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> what should hinder the two <HI>French</HI> Armies, the one in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the other in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> from being Masters of all where they go. I know very well that the Interest of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are both concern'd to defend the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> as the sequel will shew us: But in the one the <HI>French</HI> have so true a Friend, (who has so much business beside upon his hands at home) that he will concern himself no more for the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> than his Predecessor did for <HI>Luxemburg.</HI> As for the <HI>States</HI> they have but Men enough to defend their own Country, and are naturally very good Husbands: As for <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Mun∣ster,</HI> his Majesty will probably put some Men into their Towns for them, as he has done heretofore.</P>
<P>I think it a vast mistake in the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> to send Men into the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> for Governours (who for the most part) go thither only to fill their Purse, as the saying is, and so return; and to do this effectually, they don't scruple to rob both King and Countrey, pay neither Landlords nor Men, which makes them desert, so that instead of One Thousand Men in a Regiment, perhaps there is Fifty; and once I saw a whole Regiment which was going to change Garrison,
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>carried in a Waggon. In short, a Man need only to have been once in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to see this that I tell you, the Sol∣diers upon the Guard hold out their Hats to you for an Alms, and the very Officers are fain to live with the Capu∣chins upon the Alms which the good Men beg.</P>
<P>The three last <HI>Irish</HI> Regiments which the King of <HI>England</HI> granted the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for the service of the <HI>Low Coun∣tries</HI> which were effectually raised, are wasted like Snow be∣fore the Sun, and now I don't believe there's Fifty Men left. <HI>Spain</HI> in my poor judgment is very much in the wrong for another thing, that is, to rely upon its Allies for the keep∣ing of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and upon that score to neglect ha∣ving what Men are requisite for the Countreys security: Besides, they may be sure that <HI>France,</HI> knowing the tem∣per of the Governours so very well, do often feel their Pulse, and takes advantage of their weakness: Understan∣ding Men will never be beat out on't, but that the Marquis of <HI>Grana</HI> was made a Tool, and put a helping hand to the taking of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> the thing is as clear as the Sun at Noon-day; Four or Five Millions which he has left behind him are a shrewd sign of it: I tell you no improbable mat∣ter, and nothing but what happens every day; there are very few Men in our Age, who are proof against a Million of Money; I confess there are some, but you must grant me they are very rare: The <HI>Low Countreys</HI> are no Inheritance to the Governours, so that they get all they can out of it, as if they hired it. I wont say that all who come there are of the same stamp (God forbid) 'twould be sad indeed if <HI>Spain</HI> had no Subjects that were honest; but 'tis very certain that for these last Ages, <HI>France</HI> has <HI>gallanted</HI> the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and thinks them highly obliged, if not depending upon her. There's no trick which the <HI>French</HI> craft does not use to bring about their designs, for they have ever found that little
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>Countrey, a hard bone to pick, but their present King has given it devilish bites these years last past; <HI>France</HI> knows very well, too, that if they were once Masters of it, they might then bend all their strength toward <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Rou∣sillon,</HI> and having nothing left to fear or quarrel about in that Countrey, march on quickly to <HI>Madrid,</HI> which is no diffi∣cult matter when they have once made themselves Masters of some of the Frontiers to go in and out at. 'Tis for this reason that the Councils of <HI>Spain</HI> considering the strength of <HI>France,</HI> should take other measures than they do for the de∣fence of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and I see but one only expedient in the posture that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Affairs are in at present, which can give them present ease, except they had rather have that Countrey fall into the <HI>French</HI> hands, as without doubt it must, if they don't prevent it speedily. It is certain, that nothing but an Army with a good General can prevent the ruine which is falling upon their heads. We see after what fashion the Men, who are there now are paid; and the inconsidera∣ble number of them, and to say the truth, there ought to be Twenty Thousand effective Men (beside what is there al∣ready, in Garrison to secure the Countrey, and Ten Thou∣sand more, in case of a Rupture; and since <HI>Spain</HI> can't fur∣nish them with so many Men: You must let the Towns there levy Men, and pay them who will be willing to do it, to secure themselves, and avoi'd falling under the barbarous Dominion of the <HI>French,</HI> or be quite ruin'd perhaps, before it comes to that, as many Towns and Cities have been be∣fore them, and that flat Country now of late, in which the most Religious places were not spared. I know very well that that proposal has been debated in Council long since, and that the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> has ever rejected it for slight rea∣sons. A good careful Governour, especially the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who is so brave a Commander, and adorn'd with
<PB N="53" REF="28"/>Conquests at the head of Forty Thousand Men supported by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> would make <HI>France</HI> shake. <HI>France</HI> has its Emissaries in the Council at <HI>Madrid,</HI> as well as at other places, to oppose every thing which may possibly thwart her designs; and I am of opinion that it will turn to better account for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to secure his <HI>Low Countries</HI> with the help of a Militi a payd by the Cities (who wont abuse him) than to lose that Countrey for want of Men to defend it: The latter of these is almost irretrieva∣ble, but that former would be effectual, were it not for an ill∣grounded Jealousie, which possibly heretofore might have deserved consideration, but is now quite out of doors, for in my judgment we ought ever to take in hand the thing which is most urgent, when the one is inevitable, and the other may probably never come to pass. I say once more, that <HI>France</HI> can never compass her great design, but by be∣ing first of all Master of the <HI>Low Countreys:</HI> 'Twas for this reason that <HI>Du Plessis</HI> advised his Master to set upon it that way; and 'tis that pass alone which <HI>Spain</HI> and its Allies ought necessarily to stop with the same care and diligence, as they would the breach in a Bank, through which the raging Sea is ready to come in upon them, and this we shall see hereafter.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Kings Ambition and Interest is a Torrent, whose Impetuosity neither Affinity of Blood, nor Alliance, Peace, Treaties, Truce, Swearing, nor even Mutual Oaths are able to withstand: I'le go farther, no not the very bounds which God by his wise Providence has set to the li∣mits of every Monarchy, which seems to speak to each Mo∣narch, <HI>Hither shalt thou go, and no farther.</HI> But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has sworn not to rest satisfied with the Lot which the Su∣preme Monarch of the Universe has given him. Who can tell, had he once Conquered the World, but he would
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>begin again another <HI>Tower of Babel,</HI> to scale the very Hea∣vens? Ambition knows no bounds, but <HI>Pride goes before a fall.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that <HI>Spain</HI> would not suffer her self to be lull'd asleep by this deceitful Truce! 'Tis a <HI>Dalilah,</HI> which all on a sudden cry out to the <HI>Spaniards, the Philistians are upon thee:</HI> But I am afraid it will be so as 'twas with <HI>Sampson,</HI> who when he awoke, finding himself fast bound, could no longer avoid becoming a Prey and Conquest to his Enemy. The <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> are a great help to <HI>France,</HI> and con∣tribute (without dreaming on't) very much to the advan∣cing of her Interest, and support of her Ambition, whil'st they inrich themselves at their Masters Expence, and in the mean time disable him to keep up Men for their common defence; but if they were well advised, they should reflect seriously upon the Condition they are in at present, and upon that they are like to be in when they fall under the Tyranny of <HI>France:</HI> How happily would such a compari∣son obviate the misery which is coming upon them? For they must think when a <HI>French</HI> Man comes to the Crown, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will be but little considered, and at best be only pittied or despised: The natural antipathy between those two Nations wont suffer the new King to trust him∣self with them, and all their stateliness will serve only for the <HI>French</HI> Court to laugh and jeer at.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> must not flatter themselves if that comes to pass, that the Dauphin after his Fathers Death, will leave <HI>France</HI> to go and live in <HI>Spain:</HI> The King's of <HI>France</HI> will alway value <HI>Versailles</HI> beyond the finest City in <HI>Spain:</HI> They will send Vice-Roys thither who shall be <HI>Frenchmen</HI> both by nature and disposition, Mortal Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that thus they may be secure that they wont join in any thing with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against the <HI>French</HI> Interest. These Go∣vernours
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>and Vice-Roys will bring along with them, for their necessary use their <HI>French</HI> Tax, the <HI>Mal tote,</HI> which will in a little time bring forth a whole swarm of Impositions, as the <HI>Taille Taillon Aide, Grant,</HI> or <HI>Octroit, Preciput, Equivalent, Free Gift, Gratification, Aid</HI> upon <HI>Wines, Gabels</HI> upon <HI>Salt, Corn</HI> and <HI>Flower, Tobacco</HI> and <HI>Perriwigs,</HI> on all sorts of <HI>Stuffs, Linnen-cloth, Le pied fourchu,</HI> Impost upon <HI>Flesh,</HI> the Mark of <HI>Paper,</HI> upon <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Tin,</HI> upon <HI>Milled</HI> and <HI>Silk Stockings,</HI> Impost upon <HI>Ice, Controlle des Exploits,</HI> Tax upon <HI>Fee-Farms,</HI> Tax upon the <HI>New Conquests, Quint</HI> and <HI>Requint, Mortmains,</HI> the price of Valuations, the Mark of Gold, the two <HI>Sols</HI> a pound, the right of Sealage, right of <HI>Controlle,</HI> of Register and Oath, <HI>La Paulette,</HI> abate∣ment of Wages, Custom, appointment of a Governour, the Eighth Peny, Impost and the re-union to the Crown of whatsoever hath been given or sold, with some others not worth naming. Again, after that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have for their hosts some of those Devilish Farmers of the Kings Revenue who would fasten upon them, as if they were a Conquered Countrey, and at first dash would lay a Tax upon the Sun, knowing they make use of that instead of a Fagot.</P>
<P>Therefore I maintain that <HI>Spain</HI> should endeavour above all things, to dispose the Emperor to accept of a Peace, or at least a Truce with the Grand Seignior: To look out while this present King is living, for a Prince to succeed him, and that this Prince may betake himself in time to <HI>Madrid</HI> to be well known to the people, and be in the Heart of the Kingdom; To Defend it, and get Crown'd immediately upon the Kings Death: To possess himself of the great Seal, and all Instruments relating to the Crown: And to make the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> side with him as their Lord and Master.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="30"/>
<P>Moreover by this means <HI>Spain</HI> may make an early provi∣sion for the security of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and be justly un∣deceived in that pernicious Opinion which the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> has, that <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> must necessarily defend them for their own Interest. I own 'tis true, they ought to do it; but if <HI>France</HI> looses <HI>England</HI> from her true Interest, and diverts her from thinking so (as without doubt we shall find) if this comes to pass in any reasonable time, the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> whatever good in∣tentions, and whatever interest they may have in the pre∣servations of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> 'twont be in their power to stop the fury of the <HI>French,</HI> which like an impetuous Tor∣rent will in a moment sweep away the best part of <HI>Flanders.</HI> So that <HI>Spain</HI> ought to think of this in good earnest; and not lye asleep whilst the <HI>French</HI> policy is so active, and is preparing long before-hand for so important an Affair which will never be offered them again, if they let slip the opportunity of being Masters of it. <HI>France</HI> takes all ways imaginable to get one, and makes it her whole busi∣ness; it behooves <HI>Spain</HI> to do so too, if she would avoid Ruine and not fall under the Yoke of <HI>France,</HI> which is the greatest plague that can be sent upon her, no less than the Destruction and Desolation of her people, the exposing and humbling all the Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> who will be for∣ced to give place to the meanest <HI>French</HI> Gentleman. There∣fore if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are well advis'd, after the Death of their King, they ought not to suffer the Monarchy to go to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. but with the last drop of their Blood; and Banish for ever this Violent, Insolent Spirit of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P><HI>HEnry</HI> VIII.

'Tis not to be in∣vaded without going often to and fro upon the Sea, they'l have Wind and Water to fight against, and a powerful Fleet to engage with before they set foot ashore: Insomuch that if the King of <HI>England</HI> be at peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> 'tis undeniable in his power to make the Victory lean to that side he is of: <HI>France</HI> has found this so true, (although there is a perfect Hatred and Antipathy between those two Na∣tions) that she has spared no Cost, and compasses Sea and Land to withdraw <HI>England</HI> from its true lasting interest, and bring her over to their side, or at least make her stand <HI>Neuter,</HI> and look on with arms-across, while the King of <HI>France</HI> Acts his Tragedy upon the Theatre of <HI>Europe.</HI> In the mean time tis most certain that <HI>England</HI> can rescue this same <HI>Europe</HI> from being enslaved to <HI>France,</HI> better than any other Nation, if she pleases.</P>
<P>If the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> did but know his own Strength and Real Interest, he might be not only the Medi∣ator
<PB N="58" REF="31"/>and Umpire of the World, But might make Peace, when he pleases, between all the Christian Princes.</P>
<P>There are but two things requisite to effect this, both which are very easie, nay are in the Kings power whenever he has a mind to't.</P>
<P>The First is, That the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> take Care to be alwayes beloved by his People, and that there be a good understanding between him and his Parliament.</P>
<P>The Second is, To have a strict Alliance with the <HI>Ʋ∣nited-Provinces,</HI> and live in perfect Amity with them, and maintain inviolably this Union and Correspondence in all that Concerns each other. The former of these is mighty easily done, and the King will obtain it effectually, when he once resolves to Require nothing of his Parliament but what is agreeable to the Laws of the Realm, as he already promis'd in his Coronation Oath. The latter will be done so soon as His Majesty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> leaves listening to the <HI>French</HI> Emissaries, and puts out of his head all Jealou∣sies and Surmises which those Creatures continually try to possess him with, having nothing that he need be afraid of from the <HI>States,</HI> who don't wish to <HI>Aggrandize</HI> themselves, and Usurp their Neighbours Territories as <HI>France</HI> do's; but only keep what God has given them, and be able to protect their Countrey in the enjoyment of that Liberty they have at present. <HI>France,</HI> who is satisfied of the Truth of what I have said, takes all occasions to obstruct it; She is never without some of those Hellish Restless Spirits in the Kingdom, to sow the <HI>Tares</HI> of mis-understand∣ings between the King and his Parliament. Ever since the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have appeared to be <HI>Protestants,</HI> this <HI>Catholicon</HI> has wrought well, and <HI>the Spirit of France</HI> has been at work to set the Episcopal Party against the <HI>Pres∣byterian,</HI> and to insinuate into the Minds of the latter, that
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>the Bishops were inclined to <HI>Popery,</HI> and that most of them were Jesuites in Bishops Cloaths, Who would certainly seduce the people little by little, and be <HI>Turn Coates</HI> so soon as they have a good Opportunity, and dare discover their Opinion: That the King himself was Popishly-affected, and a thousand things of this nature, which exasperated the people, and made his Parliament jealous of him, for which reason they Granted nothing at all, or but very little of what the King ask't, and by this means his own private Occasions grew so very urgent that he neglected the <HI>Pub∣lick.</HI></P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the First, twas <HI>France</HI> which kindled the first Sparks of the Civil War, which caused so much Bloodshed both to King and People; insomuch that when the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador return'd home from <HI>England,</HI> he boasted how he had kindled a fire which would not be <HI>put out</HI> a good while, and that for <HI>one twenty years England</HI> should not be in a Condition to do <HI>France</HI> any harm. One <HI>Father Joseph</HI> a <HI>Capuchin</HI> was instrumental in <HI>fomenting</HI> the Division among the Catholicks under-hand, and I can assure you there were some of those Catholicks in the Par∣liament Army: King <HI>Charles</HI> himself affirms it, and tells you that the Rebellion among them proceeded from his having denied them places, and as soon as War was declared be∣tween the King and Parliament, the King of <HI>France</HI> sent <HI>Cromwel</HI> Six Hundred Thousand <HI>Livres</HI> to pay his Army at the beginning. This is publickly known, and all who liv'd in that Age know it to be true. But at present the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> having chang'd his Religion, <HI>France</HI> has chang'd her Battery too, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> is now her main <HI>Piece of Ordinance:</HI> The people are so exasperated against each other, that his Majesty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> must think of little else this good while, and will find work enough in
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>his Kingdom to compass his Ends (even though he had got a Parliament at his Devotion) and if he should live Twenty years longer he would scarce see a Conclusion, but must be fain to leave that business for his Successour. So that the King had need stand upon his Guard, while the people are thus dis-affected; He not being in a Condition to send his Army abroad, nor having Money to maintain them, <HI>France</HI> in the mean time may do what she pleases, may take the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and all <HI>Spain</HI> too if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> happens to dye, which is the thing <HI>France</HI> waits for so impatiently.</P>
<P>For the Second thing, which is an Alliance with the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> and a perfect Harmony and Agreement between those two Potentates, to oppose all Kings or Princes whatever, who shall offer to violate the peace of <HI>Christendom.</HI> 'Tis an undoubted Truth that the <HI>States</HI> de∣sire it of all things, provided it be done so securely as they may venture to rely upon it, and be back't upon occasion. Of which there is small likelihood so long as things are as they are in <HI>England.</HI> This is what <HI>France</HI> would not wil∣lingly see, since the joyning of these two powers would probably divert her from many Enterprizes, and make her lose her longing to undertake any thing contrary to the late Treaties of peace at <HI>Nimeghen</HI> and the Truce: But <HI>France</HI> takes Care to hinder this, and the mistrust and jealousie which she keeps afoot in <HI>England</HI> like magnifying Glasses, makes the triviallest Objects look greater than they are, both in publick and private Affairs: We need go no far∣ther than the business of <HI>Bantam,</HI> which might long ago have been accommodated, but <HI>France</HI> thinks it more useful to her, that things be let alone as they are, and neither go forward nor backward, for fear of a happy Result. An Union of <HI>England</HI> with the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> would give
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>no great encouragement to the <HI>French</HI> designs upon the <HI>Spa∣nish Netherlands,</HI> for if <HI>England</HI> were so minded, the King of <HI>France</HI> could never do any good, if the late King would but have seemed to have stir'd, the <HI>French</HI> had never taken <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> but they knew his weakness, and were so cun∣ning to blind him, that he good Prince, never saw the mis∣chief on't till after the City was taken.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> acted very much against her own Interest, when she parted with <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> that City opened the Gate to go into <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> But now 'twill be other∣wise if those Countreys fall under the yoak of <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> and if he by his Conquests joins <HI>Neuport</HI> and <HI>Ostend</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk: Flussing</HI> in a little time will be thought conveni∣ent for him, and then he may very well begin to dispute the Dominion of the Seas with <HI>England,</HI> and obstruct her Commerce; and if at last the King of <HI>France</HI> Masters <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> which misfortune may happen, (the <HI>Low Countries</HI> being lost) <HI>England</HI> may very well think 'tis her turn next. As 'twas for this Reason that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> told heretofore Mounsieur <HI>Sully</HI> the Most Christian Kings Embassador, that neither <HI>France,</HI> nor <HI>England,</HI> nor any other Prince had any right to pretend to the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> and further, that she would never suffer, that his King should so much as think on't.</P>
<P>This very <HI>Sully</HI> in a Letter to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. sent him word, <HI>That with a great Army (for all what the Queen had said) he might take a course to keep them in order, and take possession of such Lands and Cities in the Low Countries, as he should think fit for his turn, and join</HI> France <HI>intirely with the</HI> United Provin∣ces <HI>which is the only means</HI> (says he) <HI>to restore</HI> France <HI>to its Antient splendour, and make her Superiour to all the rest of Chri∣stendom: For if once by hook or by crook the Provinces of</HI> Lux∣emburg, Juliers, la Marck, Mons, Limburg, Aix, <HI>and</HI> Cleves
<PB N="62" REF="33"/><HI>were united to</HI> France, <HI>without doubt all the rest of the Country would be forc't to follow their example, being separated from any communication with the rest of the World. France</HI> has been fixt that way ever since she saw there was no good to be done towards <HI>Italy,</HI> but all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> are highly concerned to put a stop to that Conquest: And there are on∣ly those two Neighbouring Powers which are able, and whose Interest it is most, to hinder the progress that <HI>France</HI> makes in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> which will draw after it, as I have said before, dire effects: As for <HI>Spain</HI> of it self, 'tis on∣ly a Body standing aloof off from its Members, which has nothing left but her Tongue: She is reduc't so low, as even to say her Prayers to <HI>Notre Dame Charite,</HI> and to beg her good Masters and Friends to take care of her, and not for∣sake her: <HI>England</HI> can do much toward the preserving the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and if her King had not promis't, to sit still, <HI>Luxemburg</HI> would have been at this time as 'twas before, a bone for <HI>France</HI> to pick. His Most Christian Majesty knows this very well, and 'tis for this reason that he takes so much pains to keep his <HI>Britanique</HI> Majesty firm to his Interests, and if he wont declare for him, at least that he will look on, and accept a neutrality. To bring this about, he spares nothing, neither Presents, nor Pension, nor Tricks; and I may safely say, that the Money which <HI>France</HI> gives, is a venomous Serpent, lurking under the Rose-leaves, it smiles for the present, but will frown severely afterward; 'tis an Iron Chain plaited over with Gold, beautiful in ap∣pearance, to attract and deceive the <HI>English,</HI> but they will one day feel its weight and hardness, if they don't make an early discovery of the base ends he has who offers it, who will be their ruine at last, since they can't subsist, but by a due ballance between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I conclude then, that 'tis the King of <HI>Englands</HI> apparent Interest, for self-preservation,
<PB N="63" REF="33"/>and advancing of Trade, to oppose the King of <HI>France</HI> his Conquests in the <HI>Law Countries;</HI> for if he does not, and supposing that after the loss of that Countrey, Fortune favours him, and lets him be Master of all the Se∣venteen Provinces (which may very well come to pass, if the <HI>States</HI> are not seconded, and stand only upon their own Leggs) in what a condition will <HI>England</HI> be? <HI>France</HI> will be stronger at Sea, and more Potent in the <HI>Indies</HI> than she; <HI>France</HI> will interfere with her in Traffique every day, she will constantly have a brave Navy at Sea, and especially in the Spring, which will not let a mouse stir out of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Ports without leave, and upon the least resentment, farewel <HI>England</HI> to all intents and purposes, since there's no body left who will or dare lift up a finger in her defence.</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>Englands</HI> best Policy is to keep <HI>France</HI> under, not only to maintain her Dominion of the Seas, but also to find a convenient opportunity for the recovery of her An∣tient <HI>Demesnes</HI> which <HI>France</HI> keeps from her for Example, <HI>Britain, Normandy, Poitou, Languedock,</HI> and all <HI>France</HI> too, which belongs to it by the Marriage of the King of <HI>En∣gland</HI> with <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> from this Match came <HI>Henry</HI> V. of <HI>England,</HI> who had as much Right to <HI>France</HI> as the Dauphin has to <HI>Spain:</HI> For the three Sons of <HI>Philip the Fair, Lovis Hutin, Philip the Long,</HI> and <HI>Charles the Fair</HI> dyed all without Issue-male, and it was after this, when the King of <HI>England</HI> sued for his Right to the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Salique</HI> Law was first intro∣duc't, usher'd in by a Sermon which the Bishop of <HI>Beauvais</HI> preacht before the Convention of the <HI>States,</HI> proving by the Gospel, which sayes, <HI>The Lillies spin not,</HI> that by con∣sequence the <HI>Flower de lis</HI> which represents <HI>France,</HI> ought never to fall to the Distaff: But that Law could only af∣fect what was to come, and not what was past. Afterward
<PB N="64" REF="34"/><HI>Henry</HI> V. King of <HI>England</HI> came over into <HI>France</HI> with a Po∣tent Army, won several Victories, and at last Married <HI>Ca∣therine,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. and in the year 1421 it was sinally decreed and concluded, that <HI>Henry</HI> should be King of <HI>France:</HI> Now <HI>Isabel</HI> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> Mother to <HI>Catherine</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> made her last Will in favour of her Son in Law, and declared him Heir to all her Estate, and to the Crown, which in my judgment is a great addition to the Right which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have to the Realm of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>If the King of <HI>France</HI> had but had that Right to <HI>England</HI> which the King of <HI>England</HI> has to <HI>France,</HI> what a Company of Manifestoes and Writings should we have flie about? to demonstrate his <HI>just pretentions,</HI> as he calls every thing he is pleased to lay a claim to.</P>
<P>So that let the King of <HI>England</HI> take a view of <HI>France</HI> which way soever he will, he ought alway to suspect her, and stand upon his guard, as against one whom he certain∣ly knows to be his Enemy. He may justly be assured that he does not coaks him so without a design to get something out of him, and because he knows him the only one who is able to counterpoize his Affairs: Therefore 'tis no wonder that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. took so much pains to supply the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Necessities, and satisfie his Pleasure, Mounsieur <HI>Barillen,</HI> and Madam <HI>Portsmouth</HI> can justifie what I say, but I can assure you that the King of <HI>France</HI> regards neither Princes nor private Persons one jot farther than as they are for his turn: Nay farther, Even Vertue it self is only esteem'd by him, so long as she squares with his Interest: What value pray did he put upon either Princes or Prin∣cesses during <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Government? Were they not obli∣ged to retire (not to say driven) out of <HI>France?</HI> What subsistnance or help had their Princes in their Exile from
<PB N="65" REF="34"/><HI>France?</HI> No, 'tis to the Family of <HI>Orange,</HI> that they are ob∣liged, which furnisht them with considerable Sums of Mo∣ney; but on the contrary <HI>France</HI> was the promoter of the late Troubles of <HI>England,</HI> she gave the Princes no protecti∣on, and never contributed the least toward the re-establish∣ing of the late King in his Throne.</P>
<P>All this considered, neither just resentment from the Royal Family, nor the <HI>English</HI> Interest can decently allow of such close Alliances with <HI>France,</HI> as shall be able to make <HI>England</HI> shut her Eyes, or be a by-stander, whilst <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. takes the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> But on the other side, she ought to be continually in a posture to hinder her in every the least attempt she makes towards it, and to make use of the Six Regiments in <HI>Holland,</HI> which the <HI>States</HI> won't refuse upon such an occasion, to prevent the King of <HI>France</HI> his bringing more Men down upon <HI>Flanders:</HI> I am perswaded that those Six Regiments would be able to cope with double the num∣ber of the <HI>French;</HI> and thus by <HI>Englands</HI> only showing of her Teeth, <HI>Europe</HI> will be safe: <HI>Resist the Devil, and he will flie from you:</HI> But if you are afraid of him, he'l soon master you. <HI>France</HI> has cut out work for King <HI>James</HI> now Reigning: The Enterprize which he has taken in hand is so great, that many Men fear, and others hope, that he will never get quit of it with his Life. 'Tis no time to change Laws when the Enemy is at the Gate: 'Tis not convenient at all times, to think of working great Conversions, some Battles must be fought, to let the World see a Character both of a Soldier and a Polititian. All the World expected this and more from the King. His Mighty Courage put all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> in hopes, that he would be an Universal Comforter to them, and would afford some respite to <HI>Spain.</HI> But alas! What can his Allies and <HI>Spain</HI> hope for, whilst his sole bu∣siness is to please the Jesuits, kindles a fire in his own King∣dom,
<PB N="66" REF="35"/>which it may be he won't be able to quench when he pleases; and so long as he does so, he dares not call a Legal Free Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> lost her self by banishing the <HI>Moors</HI> out of the King∣dom. <HI>France</HI> is weakned by the Conversions she has wrought, and by driving out the Hugonots, and she has a great mind that the King of <HI>England</HI> would follow her Exam∣ple. We must not rob God of his Right, Conversions only be∣long to him, and he is able to convert the whole World with one Word: Therefore leaving the care of this to God, the King of <HI>England</HI> ought to mind the safety of his States, avoid being made the King of <HI>France</HI> his Cully, and make him keep at home, and not fall upon his Neighbours Lands, which ought to be the Barrier between them: Thus the King will do his Honour and Conduct but Justice, and satis∣fie the expectation of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Politick Spirit of <HI>France,</HI> and its Maxims, in refe∣rence to the <HI>United Provinces.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> after they had constrained <HI>Spain</HI> by force of Arms to acknowledge them for Free, High and Mighty <HI>States,</HI> depending on none but God alone; were for some time the admiration of their Neighbours, and every one laboured to procure their Friendship and Alliance, and it may be said that they were looked upon as the Umpires of <HI>Europe;</HI> but since the War in 1672, this High Reputation hath been lessened, and <HI>France</HI> hath been so cunning to play her Cards so well, that she had well nigh reduc't them to nothing; if by an un∣lookt
<PB N="67" REF="35"/>for change, the People had not put the whole ma∣nagement and command into the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s hands, and if some persons of ill designs had not been brought to condign punishment. But God whom it pleased by his Providence to protect and preserve this little Country, did after the siege of <HI>Norden</HI> send such a panick fear amongst its Enemies, that they broke up their Camp with more speed than they came, yet the thing which did most contri∣bute to these misfortunes, besides the Treachery of <HI>France</HI> was their being unprovided of good Forces, and a good Head for the Army. These Provinces relyed wholly upon the Peace, and treacherous deceitful promises of <HI>France,</HI> which all a long in time of Peace carryed on a design against the said Provinces. We see that amidst Peace, the Militia For∣ces grew slothful: Ease smiles for a little while, Men quite forsake the care of Arms, and give themselves only to some∣thing profitable and gainful: When the Enemy approa∣cheth, Men flie oftentimes to their shame (far from that Glory which was heretofore the prevailing Passion) as we might have observed in the late Wars. <HI>France</HI> was sure so long as the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> had no Captain-General, the Militia would be but ill provided, and no ways upon their Guard, and this is the reason why she was so very careful to hinder the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> from being advanced to those Dignities and Commands which he at present enjoys, by strengthning and poysoning the contrary Party: By this means the <HI>States</HI> grew weaker and weaker every day: Their Forces were disperst, their Fortifications neglected, and their strongest places fell to decay; their Magazines but ill provided with Ammunition, whilst <HI>France</HI> levyed Men un∣awares, entered into secret Alliances with <HI>England,</HI> Arch∣bishop of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Munster.</HI></P>
<PB N="68" REF="36"/>
<P><HI>Du Plessis</HI> saith very well, that every <HI>State</HI> is not thought strong or weak, but in comparison to the strength and weak∣ness of their Neighbours; that 'tis for that end that wise Princes alwayes keep a counterpoize as much as possible, that they may remain in peace and amity together, and so soon as ever that fails, peace and amity is dissolved, not being grounded upon any thing but mutual fear, or respect for one another: Now this is so true, that every Prince is jealous of the least Levy or Motion of his Neighbour, even amidst Peace, or Cessation of Arms; and do perpe∣tually observe it, and labour to get a true Information of the designs of his Enemy or Neighbour even before they be hatched; for thereby his resolutions are spoiled; now this is the thing wherein abundance of Princes and States (who stand upon cost and charges) are to seek: This is a piece of Covetousness that sometimes costs its Master and his Peo∣ple dear, and at last occasioneth a War, which perhaps might have been prevented with a small matter. <HI>France</HI> is so well assured of the Truth of it, that she lets nothing slip upon such occasions: Her Embassadors in all the Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> have Money for that purpose; and they can do their Master no better service, nor sooner win his favour, than by corrupting one or more of that Princes Council at whose Court they reside: It is their chief study Night and Day, and spare nothing to accomplish it: When they come short of the good Man, they are sure to win the Wife, that she may now and then ask her Husband; (nay, rather than fail, one of the Children may serve the turn) whether or no he was successful in such and such a business: They apply themselves in like manner to the Servants, whom they reward according to their services. These Maxims prove very lucky to them in <HI>States</HI> where there are many Heads, as in the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> who are a great rub in
<PB N="69" REF="36"/>the King of <HI>France</HI> his way in his Conquest of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> for he knows that having some of them, he may make sure of the rest, so that his main business is to lull the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> asleep by a Truce which he breakes at pleasure, supposing at that time they may neglect their Militia, as heretofore they did, and busie themselves only with Trading, for the King knows that the <HI>States</HI> hav∣ing their Wits about them, and upon their Guard, they will never consent to the taking of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> at least that they ought not to do it, since that there lyes the bounds between <HI>France</HI> and them, which they ought to have a care of, as of their Neighbours House least it be set on Fire. So that to bring about his Design what hath not the Count <HI>d'Avaux</HI> done to divide one Province against another, nay even the Cities of <HI>Holland,</HI> and espe∣cially <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>What did he not promise, what did he not engage, to accomplish his Designs? However they were not managed with such secrecy, but that the very Boys in the streets smoak't them out, through the frequent Journeys this Am∣bassador so often made to this great City, neither is <HI>Mom∣bas</HI> to be thought the only Actor in this Affair, for when he retired to <HI>France,</HI> he left many Agents behind him, to further the design in the Night, not daring to appear in the Day: but the best was, Count <HI>d'Avaux</HI> became at length to be better understood, the People began to suspect his Doctrine, for his abusing the easiness and good nature of many of them, made them sensible of his practice, and illude his Designs: but the Policies of <HI>France</HI> are more perspicu∣ous, in fomenting the differences between <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> well knowing the uniting of both their Forces together might give <HI>France</HI> it's Mortal Wound. How sweet therefore must their Divisions be to <HI>France,</HI> and espe∣cially
<PB N="70" REF="37"/>when they spring from among themselves? The last War between these two, arose from some differences in point of Traffick, and whilst the King of <HI>England</HI> was pre∣paring for the War, the King of <HI>France</HI> offered his Assist∣ance towards an accommodation with the <HI>States,</HI> on pur∣pose onely to delude them, as they well perceived after∣wards being amazed that when they drew near to a Con∣clusion, <HI>France</HI> on the sudden sided with <HI>England,</HI> and at the same time the one gave the Assault by Sea, the other by Land: and so assuring to themselves an intire Conquest of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> they divided their Spoils, the one taking the Maritime places, and <HI>France</HI> the other, but they mis-understood one another about <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> each ima∣gining to possess that himself; but there was no occasion for their casting Lots for it, for God suffer'd it not to fall into their hands: afterwards each drew home their Forces, according to the Peace which the <HI>English</HI> were the first movers of. Then did <HI>France</HI> labour what it could to strip the <HI>States</HI> of their Allies, it's King foreseeing the Dice would turn, and that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might rally, their Soldiers being in great Discipline under an experienced General, then did the King give up <HI>Mastricht,</HI> and did whatever else lay in his power to promote the peace at <HI>Nimeghen:</HI> Since which time he has alwayes bark'd at a distance, and did so much dread the <HI>States</HI> levying the last 16000 men, that Count <HI>d'Avaux</HI> used all Stratagems to prevent it, as he will do at all times whenever the <HI>States</HI> discover an inclination to arm; because that would prove some hinderance to his encroaching designs, and here I must repeat again, how much it is the Interest of the <HI>States,</HI> to prevent their Fron∣tiers from being swallowed up, which certainly in a short time will become a prey to the Usurper, upon a more spe∣cious pretence then that King has usually made use of: He
<PB N="71" REF="37"/>may publickly declare upon what right his pretensions are grounded, how that, without the least dispute these Pro∣vinces did formerly belong to <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI> the First, to <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and after that to <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and that these were in rightful possession of them till they afterwards Rebelled, and by force extorted their Liberty: He will offer them, in case they will freely submit themselves to his Dominion, to maintain their Ancient Pri∣viledges, and reserve to them the free Exercise of their Re∣ligion, and also exempt them from all impositions as he does his <HI>French</HI> Subjects; which if they shall refuse to do, then will he attack them with his Army, as he did in the year 1672. fearing no opposition from any of the <HI>Catholick Princes,</HI> before whose eyes he hath all along cast a mist with the specious pretences of Religion; but if the House of <HI>Austria</HI> continue still to be lull'd asleep, she with all her Catholicism will be irrecoverably undone.</P>
<P>But I perceive the <HI>Estates</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> next to God, must depend wholly upon their own strength, and need onely be afraid of <HI>France,</HI> and to level their whole Forces against her, whose design for these many years has been to suppress them, and if not wholly to destroy them, yet at least to reduce them so low, as they should wholly depend upon her.</P>
<P>The King would willingly agree with them after the same manner as we read in the Fable the Wolf would have done with the Sheep, dismiss your Shepherd and your Dog, cries the Wolf to these poor simple Creatures, and then will we enter into a strict Friendship and Alliance together, and live peaceably one with another; thus says Mr. King, Cashier your General, disband your Veterane Soldiers, 'twill be good Husbandry now in this time of peace, and you may assure your selves of my Friendship, and take your
<PB N="72" REF="38"/>ease during this Cessation, and so we will live Friendly and quietly together; but the <HI>Italian</HI> tells us, <HI>Trust not, and you will never be deceived:</HI> Thus as I laid down before, 'tis best for them to rely wholly upon their own proper strength, and be ever provided with a substantial Navy, both for Cruising up and down and for Convoy's, and also to have another ready to put to Sea, their strength at Sea is the right-hand of the <HI>States,</HI> and which will easily dis∣perse the storms which <HI>France</HI> do often threaten her neigh∣bours with: and if the <HI>States</HI> would ever be perswaded to train up a sufficient number of Seamen, to be in constant readiness to Man their Frigats whenever necessity required, it would produce this double advantage; 1. The State would be ever furnished with men ready for her Defence, without the Trouble of seeking where to levy them, and these will be skilful enough by the continual service. 2. She would draw from neighbouring Havens many Mariners that would proffer their services, but especially such of the <HI>States</HI> subjects as were in Foreign service would choose rather to return home when they should be sure to be in service upon the Land or the Water, the whole year round; those who are abroad, need not be frighted to return home by sharp Proclamations: 'Tis certain <HI>France</HI> can't brag much upon this account, for I am sure most of the ships she sends out but especially the Pilots are all <HI>Dutch,</HI> she confiding more in the skil and experience of them than of her own men, who never dare venture upon long Voyages; and if ever the <HI>States,</HI> should resolve upon so beneficial a method, the Policies of <HI>France</HI> would immediately be perceived to rouse, and Count <HI>d'Avaux,</HI> hound-like would hunt from Town to Town to oppose it: but he begins now to grow very angry, because of the small effect which his large pro∣mises have hitherto produced, and meerly for want of their being duly tempered with Truth and Honesty, the main
<PB N="73" REF="38"/>supporters of the Credit and Reputation of a Minister of State in a Foreign Country, but the King is obliged to this great Man for putting several stories of their High and Mightinesses into his Head, that they have no cause to thank him for.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> notwithstanding is mightily assisted in the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> by the Jesuits and other Foreign Priests, who are hired to sift out, and divert the good intentions of the People, they are crept into the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Court, where they find private Friends to serve them on all occa∣sions; they have the impudence to brag of their Intelligence of things done in his private Chamber, and they omit no∣thing that tends to the well acting of their parts; they swarm in his Troops and Garrisons, whence they transmit their intelligence to the <HI>Hague</HI> the common Office of adress, and as it were the Receptacle of the other Cities and Pro∣vinces; the greater caution therefore ought to be used, for all these Vermine are warmed by <HI>France,</HI> who is ever in action, and will deny nothing to any one whom she thinks can be serviceable to her: I my self remember, that not long ago, a Foot-man of one of the <HI>States</HI> Deputies was offered Four Ducatoons a week, to betray whatever his Master should speak of, either at his own Table, or in Discourse with the other Deputies, but the Valet with reason and height of indignation refused the baseness.</P>
<P>Thus we may observe the <HI>French</HI> Policy, make use of all wayes, how much therefore ought they to be upon their Guard, to keep off her blows: I my self observe the chief Cities about the <HI>Hague</HI> infested with Spies, who hunt eve∣ry Table, and dayly change their Dining-places, except they find some good bit or other to divert them, how cau∣tious then ought they to be, who are obliged to frequent Ordinaries: Others of these little Fellows screw themselves
<PB N="74" REF="39"/>into all Companies, others of them into the Court, at such times when the Prince and Princess Dine and Sup publickly, and all this only to observe what is said, and to make report of every small accident, even of the very Fire and Fewel: Whenever these little News-Carriers happen upon any thing of moment, away they scoure like the Basques to the <HI>French</HI> Embassadors, where they are sure of a Dinner, his Table being generally filled up with these kind of Cattle: I could name a dozen of these Animals, who to my knowledge are thus maintained, besides others who manage these concerns with more privacy, acting only in the dark: The Count <HI>de Caravas,</HI> was one of the chief of them; a Man very much esteemed of, though in my mind only like a chip in pottage, not being so cautious as he should have been, for he went about at Noon-day, and through the great Gates to carry his news: Two others whom I know to be Jesuits, are dayly disguised in Officers Habits at the Princes <HI>Levie,</HI> his times of Dining and Supping, haunting the Court all the day long, where they are ingaged in so many Intrigues, and have such numbers of Acquaintance, that they well understand what advice to give to their Friends the Catho∣licks, for after all they are <HI>French</HI> Emissaries, and wholly devoted to that Service; others of this sort get to be em∣ployed in the Kitchin, where these Cattle are too too dan∣gerous: The conclusion therefore is Natural, to keep a watch on all sides, in all times, in Peace, in War, upon the Motions of <HI>France,</HI> whose Maxims are destructive and Anti∣christian, whose King is both perjured and a Lyar, who, under the colour of establishing universally the Catholick Religion (which he himself in his Life and Faith renounces) has no other end than the Extent of his own Dominion over all <HI>Europe;</HI> first over the Protestant Princes if he can, and then over the Catholick; and thus not only to be declared
<PB N="75" REF="39"/><HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, but also Universal Emperour of <HI>Europe,</HI> and 'tis lamentable to behold with what a Covetous Eye from <HI>Versailes</HI> he looks upon the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces:</HI> 'Tis therefore advisable for the <HI>States</HI> and People of these Pro∣vinces, to put in practice what our Saviour once advised the <HI>Jews, Watch, for ye know not the hour in which the Thief will come:</HI> So, say I, be ever in a readiness to oppose him, whenever he shall endeavour to possess himself of their Hou∣ses, and usurp upon the Territories of his Neighbours, and by degrees upon that which God Almighty has disposed of to the wise Government of the <HI>States,</HI> for <HI>France</HI> must be look't upon in these dayes as the common Enemy to all Re∣publicks, as the Scourge of all that deny his Power: True it is, that his fear of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> by much exceeds his love for them, 'tis very convenient to keep him in this fear, by repelling him whenever he advances beyond his own Territories, and not so much to trust to Count <HI>D' Avaux</HI>'s deceitful Remonstrances, and his being against their putting themselves into a posture of defence, ought assuredly to perswade them that it is also contrary to his Masters desire, otherwise why should he trouble himself to oppose it. The <HI>States</HI> are more particularly engaged to be upon their Guard, and to neglect nothing which may tend to their defence, because of their too near Neighbour the Cardinal of <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> who is lately Elected Co-adjutor of <HI>Cologne,</HI> a dangerous and active Man, and already pos∣sessed with the Demon of <HI>France,</HI> whom the King can raise with his Money when he pleases, to the more easie redu∣cing the Frontiers of the Provinces, and upon all occasions will buoy up <HI>France</HI> in quarrelling with <HI>Holland</HI> upon the first notice given. The Spirit of <HI>France</HI> appears in all his Actions, so that he is equally as dangerous a Neighbour as the King himself, for his high Obligations to his Master will
<PB N="76" REF="40"/>oblige him also to concur in his designs of becoming the Uni∣versal Monarch, by swallowing up his Neighbours round about him, as will be seen in time, if some Course be'nt taken.</P>

<HEAD>The Policies and Maxims of <HI>France,</HI> in respect of the <HI>Northern</HI> Princes.</HEAD>
<P>I Place the Kings of <HI>Swedeland</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> among the chief of the <HI>Northern</HI> Princes: These are two Powerful Kingdoms, and although they are Neighbours, and nearly allyed by Marriages, yet notwithstanding are so far from loving, that like <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they mortally hate one another; and although their Interest, Trade, and narrow∣ness of Revenue ought to perswade them to live amicably together, yet notwithstanding all, their antipathy will pre∣vail; 'tis of high importance to <HI>France</HI> to have ever one of these Kings at his beck, that so she may give a diversion to the other, whenever the one should have a mind to assist the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> or the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> against her En∣croachments. The <HI>Swede</HI> being the stronger, suits best with this design of <HI>France,</HI> between whom therefore there hath been a strict Alliance, but the <HI>Swede</HI> being disappoin∣ted of his Pension, and treacherously dealt with in re∣spect of the Dutchy of <HI>Deux-Ponts,</HI> which descended to him after the Death of that Duke, but was miserably impo∣verisht by <HI>France</HI> in the Life of the Duke: These things the <HI>Swede</HI> cannot put up, but for the present 'tis not so con∣venient
<PB N="77" REF="40"/>to discover his resentments, but reserve them for a fairer opportunity, neither will <HI>France</HI> do any good now if she should present her <HI>Louis' d'or's</HI> put up like a barrel of Olives, as she did formerly to his Ambassador to soften him at the Treaty of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> which she her self hath since bragged of: All this will be to small purpose, for the <HI>Swede</HI> has already tasted sufficiently of the bitter Spirit of <HI>France,</HI> and has resolved to have nothing more to do with her. Therefore <HI>France</HI> goes now to the K. of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who had a mind next to see what kind of things these <HI>Louis' d'or's</HI> be, and therefore never stuck to side with her; when im∣mediately Count <HI>de Roy</HI> was dispatch't in quality of Gene∣ralissimo, with several other <HI>French</HI> Officers, at whose ar∣rival the <HI>French</HI> Tricks forthwith discover'd themselves, for Count <HI>de Roy</HI> immediately demanded on behalf of the King his Master, part of the supplies sent from <HI>France,</HI> pretend∣ing that they were squander'd away to no purpose. The like Complement was formerly done to the Elector of <HI>Bran∣denburgh,</HI> but Kings and Princes must consult the Honour of their Posterity and the Ages to come, as well as the pre∣sent. What a Cypher in History will a Mercenary Prince and an Hireling of <HI>France</HI> appear in future Ages, who is led like a Bear by the Nose, and thus gives a Tarnish to all his other Actions, which otherwise might be worthy com∣memoration; he must not imagine such baseness will dye with his Person, there are ever found some that will be Friends to truth, all Pens are not so Mercenary as <HI>Varilla</HI>'s and <HI>Pellisson</HI>'s.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>France</HI> has made as much use of the <HI>Dane</HI> as she can, and finds any other to be of more advantage to her, she will forsake him as one too much for his own ends, pretending some sham-quarrel or other, (as the <HI>Turks</HI> do) to fall out with him about his Pension, as she formerly
<PB N="78" REF="41"/>served the <HI>Swede:</HI> and if the House of <HI>Lunenburgh</HI> would have swallowed the Bait, the <HI>Dane</HI> should not have warm∣ed himself by <HI>France</HI> so long as he has already done.</P>
<P>But besides the Ignominy which will follow a Sovereign, who instead of depending solely upon the King of Kings, Blushes not in becoming a Vassal to his Equal, and giving occasion to <HI>France</HI> to boast like the Centurion in the Gospel, <HI>I bid my servant do this, and he doth it, and to another, go, and he goeth, and to another, come, and he cometh.</HI> I say, besides this Baseness, its most pernicious Policy, (though I doubt the <HI>Dane</HI>'s too heavy to discern it) for a small dirty sum of Money, and which serves onely to maintain his ex∣traordinary Troops, to render himself an Enemy to all <HI>Europe,</HI> and in particular to his potent Neighbours, with∣out the assistance of whom both <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway</HI> must fall to the ground. For I do maintain, that it lyes in the power of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> by a Remonstrance to do more Mischief to those two Kingdoms in one year, than they can ever recover in ten by all their Subsidies and Pen∣sions from <HI>France:</HI> I confess, by the shelter from <HI>France,</HI> he easily became Master of <HI>Holstein;</HI> but alas, good man, can he imagine to keep it, for surely that Country will take ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to oblige him to quit it, as soon as ever his Master the K. of <HI>France</HI> shall be routed out of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces.</HI></P>
<P>Were there but once a Peace concluded between the two Emperors, the victorious Christian Army would certainly make the Usurper disgorge, and reduce his Stomach to tem∣per: Soft and fair goes far. Had it not been for the Alli∣ance with <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Dane</HI> had never made that Assault upon <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> which became the Grave to so many brave <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>French</HI> that served in that Attempt; the unlucky Fort of the <HI>Starr</HI> stopt them in their Career, from whence with the loss of Two Thousand men, they were
<PB N="79" REF="41"/>obliged to retreat with shame and confusion thereby becom∣ing the laughing-stock to all <HI>Europe</HI> besides.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> as well as many others, is not real∣ly sensible of his own Interest, but suffers himself to be dazl'd by this Golden Sun, which <HI>France</HI> immediately displayes to such as she has a mind to corrupt; she ever has in reserve her <HI>Nimigen</HI> Olives to gratifie such, whose assistance she shall stand in need of: But 'tis a thing much to be hoped for, that his Majestie of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Eyes may be opened, as well as the <HI>Swedes;</HI> and that he would retrieve himself from these Shackles, and have recourse to his other Allies, in whose power it is to make the Trade of his Kingdoms to flourish, and his Revenues to increase, without being obli∣ged to keep up such a number of useless Troops as he does at present: But <HI>France</HI> well knows the necessity of having at her beck one of those <HI>Northern Princes,</HI> for fear they should unite in a strict Alliance, and so league with her Enemies: This Policy of <HI>France</HI> is the <HI>Apple of discord,</HI> and she not being able to be without a <HI>Northern</HI> Allie, if <HI>Den∣mark</HI> had stood off a while, <HI>France</HI> must have purchased her Friendship at a double rate: The Marriage which <HI>France</HI> proposed for P— <HI>G</HI>— with the P—s <HI>A</HI>— was only to strengthen <HI>her</HI> Party, and to make <HI>her</HI> Alliance the surer, this made her willing to de∣fray the Charges thereof; P— <HI>G</HI>— <HI>himself, nor the King his Brother having not much Money to spare for that purpose,</HI> this cost <HI>France</HI> a Hundred Thousand Crowns to secure to her side, as she thought, a <HI>Creature</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who should on all occasions further her designs; and to knit this the stronger, <HI>he</HI> would have <HI>had him</HI> believe, <HI>he</HI> should succeed to the Crown after the Death of King <HI>James</HI> II. to the apparent prejudice of the next undoubted Heiress, To make which the more feasible, he would have fomen∣ted
<PB N="80" REF="42"/>Jealousies between the two Sisters and their Husbands, well foreseeing a terrible blow if Affairs should change, and the Succession be kept in the right Line. 'Tis true, the King of <HI>France</HI> might think to engage P— <HI>G</HI>— in∣to a Scurvy business, by contriving a Civil War in <HI>England,</HI> after the Decease of the King now Reigning; but I cannot devise after he should have involved him in this Labyrinth, how he will extricate him: <HI>The Duke of</HI> Mon∣mouth <HI>(for all he was the Son of a King) is a caution to eve∣ry Subject.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis well known the <HI>French</HI> King is very earnest with the King of <HI>England</HI> by his Jesuites, to demand of the First Parliament he can get at his beck and Devotion, the Po∣wer to chose a Successor after the Example of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>and once gaining that, to advance the P—s</HI> A— <HI>to the Crown before any other;</HI> but many weary step, and a far Compass must be taken before he get so far: First of all, The King of <HI>England</HI> must have a Parliament at his Devo∣tion: Secondly, This Parliament must grant his Request: Thirdly, The King must choose (nay who can tell but Death may prevent all these:) In the Fourth place, 'Tis meet the People consent to this Choice: Nay last of all, 'Tis abso∣lutely convenient that the P—<HI>s</HI> of <HI>O</HI>— as Lawful Heiress acquiesce in such determinations.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King who is no admirer of Vertue, but as it keeps pace with his Interests, understanding those Noble Qualities, and Great Vertues the Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> is indu∣ed withal, that she will no sooner shine upon the Throne of her Ancestors, but she will attract and win the Hearts of all her Subjects, both by her Wisdom, and also strict Alliance with her Neighbours: He sees that these Ties and Bonds may in time make him disgorge what he hath swallowed, and repent of all the sorrows he hath caused, and still doth cause
<PB N="81" REF="42"/>Christendom to suffer: Who knows but God may have marked out this Great and Vertuous Princess as a second <HI>Judith</HI> to put this Blasphemous <HI>Holofernes</HI> to Death: Yea, this is what this Usurper and Disturber of Christendom is so sensibly apprehensive of, and endeavours to hinder, by feeing and corrupting the Great Men of <HI>England,</HI> by making sure of all the Catholicks, and of <HI>Ireland</HI> it self, thereby to give them relief in case of necessity.</P>
<P>But P— <HI>G</HI>—and his Consort P—s <HI>A</HI>— will look bet∣ter about them, and will not suffer themselves to be deluded by this deceitful Spirit of <HI>France:</HI> They see all its pernici∣ous and deceitful Maxims, and will wait for the time Providence hath determined for their Succession to the Crown; they have already gained the Peoples Hearts, the Esteem and Reputation of <HI>Europe;</HI> and of their Allies; and by this means may be assured to back and justifie their rightful Titles at that time, in case any one should dare to oppose it.</P>
<P>As for the Princes of the House of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> they are taken notice of and watched, they are encompast with <HI>French</HI> Emissaries on all sides, who do nothing but continually set before them the Advantages that may accrew to them by accepting of the <HI>French</HI> Kings Pensions; or to speak the truth, make themselves Slaves to <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> just following the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Example, to dance after his pipe. The <HI>French</HI> pence often stick too close to the fingers of the Ministers of those Courts, <HI>Bois-David</HI> and his Kinsman St. <HI>Pouage</HI> could tell us fine stories of their tricks, and certain too, they could deliver brave Memorials concerning that Court, had not <HI>Bois-David</HI> been for the Kings turn, he durst ne∣ver have had the face to have come home into <HI>France</HI> as he did, be¦ing found guilty upon the score of a Duel with <HI>Aubjou;</HI> for there is no fault how hainous soever, but the King pardons, if the Male∣factor be judged needful for his Interest and Ambition: We are confident the King proffers vast Sums to withdraw the Princes of the House of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> from their true Interest, and so bring them under the <HI>French</HI> Yoak; but I would have them disabus'd: 'Tis no wayes Honourable nor creditable for Free and Soveraign Prin∣ces to stoop so low as to be <HI>Mercenary</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and 'tis certain all these offers are for nothing else but to loosen them∣selves from their honest true Allies, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and the States of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> whose
<PB N="82" REF="43"/>pecial Interest it is to hold fast, and be firmly united, as well by reason of the nearness of their <HI>States,</HI> as upon the account of Trading; and that fair correspondence which hath alwayes reigned amongst them: So that a Man may safely avouch they serve to maintain, and mutually preserve one another. Now <HI>France</HI> hath a design in it, in meaning to oblige the Princes of <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> to come over to her Interest; for should the King of <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> chance to dye suddenly, she would have occasi∣on for those three forementioned Powers to be able to oppose them with the <HI>French</HI> Troops joyned to theirs, in case any one of them should be in action.</P>
<P>'Tis most evident, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. ought to labour as he doth to procure himself Allies to second his Designs upon the same score as he doth for <HI>Denmark,</HI> whether it be to hinder the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> passage into <HI>England,</HI> or when he means to fall upon <HI>Holland</HI> in good earnest; these two concerns go to his heart, and is his sole grief considering the Grand Conquest of the Em∣perour, who will be like to grieve him to the heart with his Vi∣ctorious Army after peace made; nay, and perhaps make him lose his longing, to put some of his great designs in Execution, for which he labours tooth and nail, and now begins to cool up∣on it, to the end he may so well order his business, that he may neither meet with any impediment, or at least that he may divert and busie those who mean to withstand it.</P>
<P>I dare safely affirm, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is the only Man the <HI>French</HI> King dreads, and that the very thoughts of the Suc∣cession of a Royal Princess to the <HI>English</HI> Crown puts him in a deadly fright, which gives him a Stool without a Pill, knowing withal that this as great a Politician as Captain (not knowing what Corruption means) perfectly verst in the true interest of <HI>Europe,</HI> will say as Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did, that none had any thing to do to pretend to the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> and will not endure that ei∣ther the King of <HI>France</HI> nor any other should make himself Ma∣ster of it, which will be very feasable when he shall be advanced to this Dignity, and this is the reason why the Spirit of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great encompasseth the Earth, and would fain associate him∣self with as many Princes as possibly he can to shelter himself from the impending Storm and Tempest, and secure him from that Thunder that is ready to break out against him.</P>
<PB N="83" REF="43"/>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> is at a great distance from <HI>France,</HI> can neither hurt it by Sea or Land, but can do him great service indirectly, as crossing the De∣signs of the Emperour, or by falling upon <HI>Swedeland,</HI> especially <HI>Swedeland</HI> when <HI>France</HI> thinks good; for there wants not a plausible excuse when a Prince means to make an attempt. <HI>Casimir</HI> Son of <HI>Si∣gismond</HI> had a lawful one indeed; for this <HI>Sigismond</HI> being as yet King of <HI>Sweeden,</HI> was elected King of <HI>Poland:</HI> He kept nevertheless his first Kingdom, until Prince <HI>Charles</HI> his Uncle was proclaimed King in the absence of his Nephew King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> who sent a Senate con∣sisting of Forty Jesuits to have full power of deciding all State-Matters, and were to reside at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> being dispatched with full instructions by Patent, impowering them with Royal Authority: But when the Senate was arrived in <HI>Stockholm</HI> Road, Prince <HI>Charles</HI> with all the Nobility went out to meet them with Twenty or Thir∣ty Ships to do the more Honour to these new Senate. This Squa∣dron coming round about the Vessel of their Reverend Senators, gave them a broad-side, seeming to welcom them: Their Ships im∣mediately sprung divers leaks, and the Jesuits went down to hold their first Session in Quality of Senators at the bottom of the Salt Sea, none using any means to save one of them. In the upshot, Prince <HI>Charles</HI> was Elected King, the Arch-bishop dispensed with the Subjects Oath of Allegiance, which they took to <HI>Sigismond</HI> and his Uncle was proclaimed King.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King thinks himself concern'd in the Election of a King of <HI>Poland;</HI> thither he usually sends an Embassador with some <HI>Lewisses</HI> to carry on the Election in favour of some Prince of his Faction, but especially that he may not be true and stedfast to the Faction of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> King <HI>John</HI> now Reigning, his Queen being a <HI>French</HI> Lady, hath contributed very much to the Bishop of <HI>Beauvais</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Embassador, to solicite in her behalf, because the Most Christian King always thought that by the Queens Intercession he should prevail with the King to come over to his Interests, and he was not altogether mistaken. True indeed the repulse she suffered from the King of bestowing the Titles of Duke and Peer upon the Marquiss <HI>D' Arquier</HI> her Father, and acknowledging her to be his Daughter, and of giving her the honour of Queen in case she should come into <HI>France,</HI> had a little cooled her; but when it will cost the King but a little sheet of Parchment to please a Prince, the King is extraordinary liberal of it at Court, especially
<PB N="84" REF="44"/>if he have need of him. So likewise out of acknowledgment of these favours you see the King of <HI>Poland</HI> doth whatsoever his Bene∣factour will have him; and St. <HI>Lewis</HI> is in great power in that Realm. Yet I don't look upon it as the true interest of <HI>Poland</HI> to make such a stop, the wayes being so good since the deliverance and relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> the issue and result of his great exploits would have Eternized his memory by giving a peace to the Grand Seignior upon advantageous terms for <HI>Poland;</HI> but the best of all was, he might have secured the Crown upon his Sons head, for questionless they could not in Justice have denyed it him, as an acknowledgment of all his Victo∣ries. We are not ignorant that the Spirit of <HI>France,</HI> very prodi∣gal of promises, and fertile in cunningness, do ascertain the King and Queen, that Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> their Son shall not fail of a Crown, and your Golden <HI>Lewisses</HI> work wonders: But who pray will give <HI>Lewis</HI> a lease of his Life till then? I must needs say he caused to be put under his Statue, <HI>Viro immortali,</HI> but I have found also in the same place, <HI>Cum fistula in ano.</HI> So that he may dye before the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and if he do dye, it may so come to pass that his Successour may have so many Irons in the fire at home, that he will never think of seeking any more abroad.</P>
<P>But now <HI>France</HI> offers the young Prince Royal of <HI>Poland</HI> for pledge of their Truth and Friendship the Princess <HI>de Conti la Valliere,</HI> whom they also offered to the Prince of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as if there were no more Legitimate Princesses in <HI>Europe:</HI> I am perswaded the King of <HI>France</HI> thinks he doth the <HI>Polonians</HI> a great deal of Honour, by offering them one of his Natural Daughters for to be their Queen. This would be fine to employ the Pens of those Droll-Wits, <HI>Pasquin</HI> and <HI>Murforio:</HI> 'Tis certain, if the King of <HI>Poland</HI> should give way to this aukward Contract of Alliance, it would be as much as to de∣clare plainly, that he no longer pretended to have the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> for his Son, and that this Marriage was an act wholly dis∣claiming it: I would have him rather follow the King of <HI>Portugals</HI> example; he was cunning enough to get himself disentangled from the importunities of <HI>France,</HI> to strengthen himself by his alliance with the House of <HI>Austria</HI> and the Emperour, by his Marriage with the Princess Palatine of <HI>Newbourgh;</HI> he knew too well, that if ever <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. got footing in <HI>Spain,</HI> that his Kingdom would depend on his disposal. One of the two Teeth this same <HI>Lewis</HI> was born with, is called Usurping, the other Cruel; from the one proceeds
<PB N="85" REF="44"/>dependance, decorum, or convenience of Scituation, from the other, Treachery and Persecution; you need not question, if the King of <HI>France</HI> should become King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but <HI>Portugal</HI> would be first of all invested, because the <HI>Spaniard</HI> possest that Kingdom from <HI>Philip</HI> II. until <HI>Philip</HI> IV. time, which was about the year 1640, when the <HI>Portugueze</HI> shook off the <HI>Spanish</HI> yoak; Threescore years of possession may plead prescription, whereon to ground his right of dependance (there needs only thirty for a private man), besides the right of de∣corum, or commodious Scituation; for <HI>Portugal</HI> joyns upon the Kingdom of <HI>Castile, Aragon</HI> and <HI>Granada;</HI> he had not so good a Title to the Kingdom of <HI>Austrasie;</HI> nay he hath quite turned out the Princes who possessed one part of the Lands of that Kingdom for near 600 years.

<HEAD>The Spirit or Policy of <HI>France,</HI> and its Maximes, in regard of the <HI>Suisse Cantons</HI> his Allies, and of <HI>Savoy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland</HI> being free and absolute are govern∣ed by themselves, hold of none but of God and their own valour; they are partly reformed, and partly Roman Catho∣lick; 'tis by reason of this difference of Religion, that they have of∣ten variance amongst themselves, and give the King of <HI>France</HI> occasion to lay hold on the opportunity, who makes good use of the easiness of the latter to sow the seed of dissention among them. In time past they did no way border upon <HI>France,</HI> which was a great hap∣pyness for the <HI>Cantons,</HI> but since the peace <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. made with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Country of <HI>Gex</HI> belonged to that Prince; then after that <HI>France</HI> which alwayes gets ground, did make encroach∣ments in <HI>Alsatia, Franche Conte,</HI> and towards <HI>Burgundy,</HI> is at this time Neighbour to the <HI>Swisse</HI> on three several sides: But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. not content with that, had a mind to be a nearer Neighbour to his fellows, by the Fort of <HI>Huninghen</HI> within Canon shot; as we all know, from <HI>Basil,</HI> the Governour hath lately attempted it, the <HI>Suisse</HI> were too much overseen in being a little to well acquainted witsi the King of <HI>France,</HI> who thereby hath found out where their strength and weakness lyes, and which way soever their affairs turn, whensoever they are forced to quarrel with these Princes, it will alwayes fare with them as the Fable tells us, it did with the Earthen pot and Iron pot. Secondly, To lend so many Regiments to <HI>France,</HI> are as so many men lost out of the <HI>Cantons,</HI> who, it may be, one day, may like young Vipers, destroy their common Mother,
<PB N="87" REF="45"/>their Countrey; there are few <HI>Swisse</HI> Officers in the <HI>French</HI> Kings Ser∣vice, but let themselves be corrupted by Marriages, then suffer their Eyes to be dazled by good places, and your <HI>Louis do'r,</HI> and so at once renounce both their Religion and Party, sacrifice as <HI>Stoupa</HI> the Lieute∣nant General would have done twice sixteen <HI>Cantons</HI> to the Interest of <HI>France:</HI> He is not alone in his own gang, he hath, God knows, too many Disciples; you'l find but very few who imitate the Sieur <HI>Dasselouer</HI> of <HI>Berne</HI> heretofore Captain in the King's Service, who chosed rather to give over his employ, and break his Pike then do any thing contrary to the Treaty which his Superiours had entered to, about the passage of the <HI>Rhine</HI> against the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> they have also committed a no∣table fault in tying up their own hands, that they cannot send to <HI>Spain</HI> the like number of Soldiers, as they do to <HI>France:</HI> This restriction hath more of the <HI>Frenchman</HI> in it than the <HI>Cantons</HI> are aware of: They cannot but grant that they have suffered themselves to be curb'd by the Fort at <HI>Huninghen,</HI> which but too much discovers the Kings de∣sign; every <HI>chink</HI> in it are like so many open Mouths, crying out upon them, Awake, awake ye sluggish People, and behold me, as the Emblem of the Usurper, as a Monument rear'd in remembrance of your Liberty lost.</P>
<P>Now if this be not sufficient to make the <HI>Cantons</HI> seriously reflect upon <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. his proceedings in respect of them, at least that Cannon which the Fort of <HI>Huningen</HI> discharged upon the City of <HI>Basil</HI> might open their Eyes, for the Usurper gets ground every day, and I'le warrant you no sooner shall he find a favourable oppor∣tunity, but he will improve his quarrel with <HI>Germany</HI> against them. Princes never want pretences: He will begin in good earnest, to Will and Command, that the Bishop and others of <HI>Basil</HI> be restored, and that their Arrears be payd them from the time that they have been forced to forsake the Town; and if he be to enter by Force of Arms, and if he have obtained the least Advantage, as the <HI>Cantons</HI> are tame enough to obtain Peace he would demand every year a Me∣dal as a mark of Homage for Tribute (as he did of the <HI>Hollanders</HI>) together with a great many Forces which the <HI>Swisse</HI> would be glad to supply him with upon his first Demand, and would place Bishops as so many Emissaries in every City.</P>
<P>I told you the <HI>French</HI> King takes advantage by the difference of Religion in the <HI>Cantons</HI> to foment discord amongst them, as we have lately observed in the business of <HI>Glaris,</HI> which setting aside the
<PB N="88" REF="46"/>Popes Nuncio's stirring in it, would have proved the first spark of Fire and Dissention amongst them, then which he desires nothing more the better to further his Affairs, and his pretended Reign over <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> The <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in those parts are commonly ignorant in their Religion, and being very stupid at the bark, and with the out∣side, without ever searching into Fundamentals; the only name of Catholick actuates, moves, and incites them, without inquiring any farther; but I would have them once for all be undeceived; not suffer themselves to be imposed upon under the false Notion of Catholick: 'Tis a false mask under which he lurks the better to de∣ceive them, and bring them to his Leure; thereby to set them at odds amongst themselves, and having once done that, he will come pouring down upon <HI>Basil</HI> or <HI>Geneva,</HI> yea, perhaps upon both toge∣ther. These are bars and boundaries which ought to be in a manner Sacred; the <HI>Cantons</HI> should take care that they be never suffered to be medled with nor touched; they are to defend them with their Sword in their Hand to the last drop of Blood; for this passage being clea∣red, and the discord breaking out amongst them, farewel they, they are undone to all intents and purposes, of free <HI>Swisse</HI> they'l become <HI>French</HI> Slaves: But now if the generality of the <HI>Swisse</HI> be but true to one another, and united, and but shew the Usurper their Teeth, intimating their resolution of defending what's their own, they may be sure the <HI>French</HI> King will only bark at a distance, on the other hand, if they shew no more eagerness for these two Cities than they did for <HI>Franche Compte:</HI> If they make no stouter a resistance than they did there, they will unavoidably post on to their total ruine and destruction. I know <HI>France</HI> will not bring them under their yoak, but make them tributary. They are now free and absolute, but let them take heed they suffer not their Necks to be brought un∣der their yoak; let them call to mind their Ancient Valour, that their Countrey has proved a Sepulchre to the <HI>French,</HI> and that they have forced them to a dishonourable retreat: <HI>Geneva</HI> is a delicate bit the <HI>French</HI> have a Moneths mind to, since she hath appropriated to her self the County of <HI>Gex,</HI> methinks that Republick too lyes very commodiously for her purpose: They have a long time muttered at the <HI>French</HI> Court, that they meant to resettle the Bishop a Savoyard who is nominated by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> whom he makes to reside at his Court to make his Right appear: If it were as easie for the <HI>French</HI> King to settle a Bishop there as it has been for him to settle
<PB N="89" REF="46"/>a Resident, he would have accomplisht it long ago: Now since this Resident comes in our way, let us speak a word or two by the by concerning his Residence. You must know he is as necessary a Man there, <HI>as the Fifth wheel in a Chariot,</HI> for he is good for nothing but to receive the <HI>Swisse</HI> Packet of Letters for the Court, which a Merchant formerly received, so that the Sallary, and the Abode of such a Mi∣nister would be useless, if there were not something else in it. I dare say he would have but a poor pittance, had he no other com∣ings in but what <HI>France</HI> allows him, and if he had not the best part of it from the Clergy: I do remember that the first Man that filled this worthy place, was one <HI>Charigni,</HI> a poor pittiful Fellow, whom Mounsieur <HI>De Pompone</HI> had often released out of <HI>Fort L'evesque</HI> whi∣ther he was committed for Debt, and sent him thither to get him disintangled: There he made a Trade of the <HI>Catholick Religion,</HI> for every Sunday and Holy-day was his days of Receipts; every <HI>Sa∣voyard</HI> that came to Mass, giving to the Offering Five or Six Souse, under pretence of maintaining the Church and Priest, but rather Mounsieur the Resident, who besides kept a kind of an Ordinary where they might dine, the poor Wretch was fain to catch at any thing, for he was no better than a Beads-man living upon Alms at <HI>Paris,</HI> being forced to quit <HI>Province</HI> upon the account of some false pieces of Five sous he would have put off, where he was reduc't to Ex∣tremity, and all the stir he kept at <HI>Geneva</HI> was only to make the Magi∣strate to greese his fist, and present him with something by the by, <HI>as no body knew.</HI> But since the time his Secretary has changed his Religion, and since he gave his Almoner a box on the Ear, because he spoke in behalf of the Protestants, upon a Sermon that he and the Resident came from hearing: I say, from that time he hath laid open his folly, he is countermanded, and another of better sense and more discretion supplies his place. Considering the design the King has in hand of dividing this City, it seems to be in a manner necessary at present to have a Resident to acquaint him with all concerns, to find out where∣in their strength and weakness consists; yea, to corrupt some Magi∣strate or other, as at <HI>Strasbourg;</HI> the enterprize of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> in the year <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> ought continually to be before their Eyes as a warning; for it is certain, that the <HI>French</HI> King with what amusement soever he may seem to divert them; doth but wait a fair opportuni∣ty to spring his Mine, give fire to his Train, and play his old game as he did at <HI>Strasbourg;</HI> so that it mightily behoves the Citizens of
<PB N="90" REF="47"/><HI>Geneva</HI> to stand upon their guard, and endeavour to dispose their Allies to afford them succour so soon as ever they find that grand Usurper to advance; for he is now taking his aim, and so well play'd his Cards, that he hath made the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to sneak and truckle, not daring so much as to put his Nose towards <HI>France:</HI> In times past, the Dukes Ancestors did defend the City of <HI>Geneva</HI> as well as the Inhabitants; they had a great deal more reason for it then <HI>France</HI> now a days, upon the account of the pretensions to it, and the rights the Counts of <HI>Geneva</HI> have yielded up to the Duke of <HI>Savoy. Charles</HI> IV. Proclaimed that Duke Prince of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and of all the Territo∣ries thereunto belonging, and they have inherited it till the Year, 1532. But the present Duke is so far from making any opposition against <HI>France,</HI> that he would rather deliver up all his Rights and Claims to it, and let himself be cullyed out of it under pretence of reinvesting the Bishop; now although that Prelate should be setled, and <HI>France</HI> master of it, what course would the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> take, if the King would not remit to him? Would he have recourse to Menaces or Reprisals? If he should do so, the King of <HI>France</HI> would jerk him soundly, like a Boy, and would make him kiss the Rod to boot. So that I would not have <HI>Geneva</HI> to flatter her self with the treacherous promises of the <HI>French</HI> King, nor yet with the Assistance; which Policy and Reason might oblige the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to send them. Let her e'ne rely on her Allies the <HI>Swisse Cantons,</HI> upon her own, though slender Forces, and upon so many <HI>French</HI> Officers who have fled for refuge thither, who will be sure upon the first news of it, to run to her assistance, or otherwise they must have lost com∣mon Sense, and all sentiments of Honour and Thankfulness. Again, if so be the Emperour make his Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> he must send for the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> to help him, who is a great Captain, and even laden with Victorious Lawrels, whose very name will make <HI>France</HI> quake. I, and he may serve him for a inlet whereat to enter into his Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> where his Subjects quite spent with the Tyrannical Dominion of <HI>France,</HI> expect him as their <HI>Moses</HI> and deliverer.</P>
<P>The King is a Lyon in a Foxes Skin, he is not so formidable as men believe him; his only end is to make himself be feared, and he obtains his desire by threatnings; but shake off this panick fear, look upon <HI>France</HI> nearer, mind her soberly and seriously, consider the continual running away of her Inhabitants, the punishment and
<PB N="91" REF="47"/>imprisonment of another part of them, is as so much Bloud flowing from her Veins, which by little and little weaken her. Add hereto the just complaints of the Catholicks, the decrease of her Revenues, and what is worst of all for her, the death and the going away of so many Generals within these few years, and so suddenly one after another, doth she not seem to behold that Scene Heaven hath contri∣ved on purpose to humble her, for indeed she is at a lower ebb then one would imagine: I'll engage she is as sick as her King, and that they be both smitten to the heart.</P>
<P>The first Enemy that sets upon her will not be long alone, he will be soon seconded; but it will be just as in the Fable of the Counsel of Rats, who consulted together to go hang a Bell at the Cats neck their sworn Enemy, but not one of them durst venture to do it first. Who would ever have said the Pope would have contributed his assistance to the Union of the <HI>Switzers?</HI> Yet 'tis true he did so, as we may have observed in the business of <HI>Glaris,</HI> which I have above recited: Nay his <HI>Nuncio</HI> is very intent, at his leisure hours, to open the eyes of the Catholick <HI>Cantons;</HI> for those silly people, provided the King tell them of intending to re-establish a Bishop, 'tis enough for them, that's all they care for, but they are not sensible of what is behind the Hill, that the grand Usurper lyes hid under the Bi∣shops Mitre.</P>
<P>I have but one Admonition more to give the Right Honourable <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> that is to say, the King hath no respect nor good will towards them. He takes them for Scaffolds to be made use of when need requires, and when that is over, he looks upon them as no body. I desire no other proof of what I say, then what of a fresh date happened to the Ambassador, which the <HI>Cantons</HI> not long since sent to the <HI>French</HI> King: After he had wrangled with them about their Commission not being in general Terms, on pur∣pose to refuse them Audience; well, this difficulty once removed by a second Commission dispatched to them, they were e'ne fain to go away as they came, without so much as seeing the King, or ob∣taining one only Audience. This is the greatest undervaluing, and most sensible affront that ever Free-born men had given; and if the <HI>Cantons</HI> pass by this, and don't shew their just Resentments of it, they'l be despised by all the Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> and it will not be the last ill turn of this nature that will befall. But that I may fully certifie you of the truth of what I here deliver, see here word for
<PB N="92" REF="48"/>word the Harangue, or rather Complement, these Gentlemen past upon Mounsieur <HI>Colbert Croissi</HI> Minister of the Foreign Affairs at their departure.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes"> Sir, Our Lords and Superiours sending us hither to do what in us lyes, and make use of all importunities to endeavour to win the Kings affection, to the end he might be inclined to uphold the City of <HI>Geneva</HI> their Allie, in the possession of what they have hitherto been above One Hundred and Eighty Years grounded up∣on Authentick Treaties.</Q></P>
<P>But his Majesty being resolved to commit to his Parliament of <HI>Dijon,</HI> a business which is plainly acknowledged for an affair of State, which depends upon Treaties of Peace, Covenants and Alli∣ances; the which said Parliament our Superiours will never acknow∣ledge as just, no, nor give their Allies, the Citts of <HI>Geneva,</HI> counsel to yield to their Treaty, which is theirs also. Moreover his Ma∣jesty giving us to understand by your Excellency, that he would no more then you confer with us touching this matter; and because we are afraid that a longer stay here might be as unwelcome as our coming; we could not do better then withdraw home again to make a faithful report of what hath past to our Lords and Superiours.</P>
<P>We are come to take our leaves of your Excellency, and to give you many thanks for the patience you have had in several Confe∣rences, beseeching you that in pursuance of the reiterated Orders we have had given us in behalf of our Lords and Superiours, who notwithstanding they be much troubled at the bad success of this Embassy (seeing they take more into consideration the prosecution of 25 Canons, then the fidelity of many thousands of the best and most stedfast Allies of that Crown, who have shed their Blood, and sacrificed so many brave men, for the service, grandeur, and main∣taining of that State) yet that nevertheless they will stand to their Treaty of Peace and Allyance, in the hopes they have always enter∣tained, and do still entertain, that his Majesty, (to whom with the Royal Family they wish all happiness) will on his part be responsa∣ble. As for our part in particular, though we have not had the happiness to see his Majesty, yet we cannot chose but wish him all Personal Health, and do assure your Excellency, of the esteem and high value we put, and all ways shall, upon your deserts and incom∣parable vertue, protesting to you, that we are more particularly your most humble Servant.</P>

<P>After such a base affront, who would not undervallue such Em∣bassadours the Representatives, and their Superiours also, who durst present them with a Golden Chain of 500 Crowns value? One would think they had an hand in it, and that they were covetous of Mo∣ney and Presents: If an Embassadour after taking such an affront should have accepted it, he would have deserved to be hanged with that Golden Coller. By the refusal of Audience you may well under∣stand what <HI>France</HI> is made of, and its designs: Whoever heard or saw a free and absolute Republique referr'd to a Parliament under his Authority, as the King refers <HI>Geneva</HI> to the Parliament at <HI>Dijon;</HI> it would have been more legal and just to have refer'd them to the Parliament at <HI>Turin.</HI> Now behold the equity of this great King, who would always be both Judge and Party in his own Cause, who would make all <HI>Europe</HI> depend on his Judges; some upon those of <HI>Metz,</HI> others on those of <HI>Dijon</HI> and <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> as he forces the people of <HI>Orange</HI> to do; but we hope those of <HI>Geneva</HI> will not sub∣mit to those unjust Judges; and supposing they do, they will not miss losing their Cause, and after that, they will make a new pre∣tension upon them, till they have fettered them, and losing their City and Liberty, they become the slaves of <HI>France;</HI> a Victim offer∣ed up to the Jesuit, and the Conquest of <HI>Lewis</HI> the great, and it is odds, but that will be so indeed if they don't look about them be∣time, and prepare themselves for its coming upon them; for he'l come and give them a visit, as he did the <HI>Genoueses.</HI> Let them not flatter themselves with the contrary, when he shall make them re∣solve to sacrifice themselves for their Liberty, rather then to a Prince who would be their <HI>Antiochus,</HI> their bloody Master, and would snatch the Children from their Mothers embraces to deliver them into the hands of the Jesuits; make them forsake Relations, Religion, and all duty of Christians, and refusing to obey this ambition, would hale them to the Scaffold, and throw their Carcasses to dogs; nay, if so be they should deal more gently with them, it would be only to make them bear company with his own Subjects in Dungeons, in the Gallies, and in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> Now take notice of this Spirit of <HI>France,</HI> and beware of it.</P>

<HEAD>That <HI>Lewis XIV.</HI> is no good Christian.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall finish this Treatise in demonstrating that this King is no good Christian, that it is but a cloak for his Knavery, the bet∣ter to play fast and loose, the better to bring about his ambitious designs, that albeit he makes a great clutter with the title of most Christian King at <HI>Rome,</HI> yet we find him to be nothing less: All who are baptized are not Christians, for then we might reckon <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate and <HI>Arrius</HI> to be such, whom men look upon as Apostates and <HI>Antichrists.</HI> I am perswaded the Marquiss <HI>de Montespan</HI> will justifie what I say. I cannot think that Prince worthy the name of a Chri∣stian who covets his Neighbours Wife; nay before all the World takes her from her Husband, makes use of her, and begets Children of her, whom he would fain get declared natural, never before <HI>Lewis</HI> his time practiced in <HI>France:</HI> He cannot assume the name of Chri∣stian who makes little Conscience to break the most solemn Oaths and Engagements made at the Communion, as he did at the Peace con∣cluded at the <HI>Perinees,</HI> upon his Marriage with the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> And then the Oath taken at his Coronation, to observe the Edicts of pacification, are they not dayly violated and retracted upon every frivolous pretence? Good Christians are such who live up to those Vows they have made, even to very Infidels.</P>
<P>The Marquiss <HI>de Laverdin</HI> making his publick entrance into <HI>Rome,</HI> did choose rather to do it like a Fox than a Lyon, (as since it appears) without ever determining any thing positively concerning it, when they demanded him to explain himself before he made his entrance; so that engaging himself neither <HI>pro</HI> nor <HI>con,</HI> it will always be time enough, and seasonable to make his Masters will to stand him in stead, as we shall see hereafter, when the <HI>Provencal</HI> Fleet shall be before <HI>Ci∣vita Vechia,</HI> and other Ports of the Popes Dominion; besides that, it was convenient to carry it fair to obtain the Bull for the Cardinal of <HI>Furstenburg,</HI> whom <HI>France</HI> was assured would be nominated to the Coadjutorship of <HI>Cologn;</HI> the Dean and Chapter, as 'tis credibly given out, fingered the Kings Money; to that in effect it was registred and their Votes sold, so that it was not possible to go back with their word. When the Marquiss <HI>de Lavardin</HI> entred <HI>Rome,</HI> the business
<PB N="95" REF="49"/>was as good as done, and the King made sure of it, but he found himself mistaken, as to the Bull, for he believed the Pope, who is wise and good natured enough of himself, not loving noise, would yield at the Embassadors arrival, that the Spiritual would give place to the Temporal; but he was deceived in his account, meeting with such stiffness and vigour in an old man, which it may be one durst not have hoped for in a young man. In the mean time behold the Marquiss <HI>de Lavardin</HI> keeping watch and ward night and day, and that round about the Palace of <HI>Fernese,</HI> just as if it were a Fort sur∣rounded with enemies, before the Pope and the Conclave of Cardi∣nals Noses: By all these riots and indignities done to the most emi∣nent person of the Church, Vicar of Christ, and St. <HI>Peters</HI> Successor, is nothing in comparison to that which <HI>Talon</HI> the Kings Advocate hath belched forth against his Holiness, and the Cardinals his Coun∣sellors, accusing the former to be a favourer of Heresie, Jansenisme, and of Quietists, and a thousand other impertinences, which is to be seen more at large in the demand of the abovesaid <HI>Talon</HI> to the Par∣liament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and by the Embassadors protestation publickly af∣fixed at <HI>Rome,</HI> the expressions therein are scandalous, that they might deservedly procure the fire for a private person; but when one hath the power in his own hand, he thinks he may Lawfully say and do whatsoever likes him: But the Pope who is grave and wise will let him go on, yea peradventure his great modesty and prudent beha∣viour may make the King come to himself again, and acknowledge the wrong, and that the Pope is Master at home in his own House, and may be able to disannul and take away the Franchises of the Em∣bassadors quarters, when he shall see it convenient for the repose of his People, and his own Conscience.</P>
<P>It is not his frequenting Mass which is a Characteristical mark of being a Christian, or for being kind to the Jesuits; for fear awes Princes sometimes to make much of Jesuits, and shew much respect to them. <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. was not free from this fear, when he would have restored them in <HI>France;</HI> for when the Duke of <HI>Sully</HI> advised him to the contrary, he started up and replyed, <HI>secure me my Life then;</HI> for 'twas more then probable, that those who sued for their return had assured the King, that if he did not do it he would be in immi∣nent danger of being Murthered: When Life is at stake what will not a man do to save it? Who can tell but these good Fathers have told the King now Reigning, if in case he did not root out all the
<PB N="96" REF="50"/><HI>Huguenots</HI> out of his Dominions, this must come in alwayes, <HI>ad majorem Dei Gloriam,</HI> that he would endanger his Life.</P>
<P>What sign of a Christian was there in the King when he made a League with <HI>Cromwel</HI> to fall upon the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and to banish <HI>Charles</HI> II. from his Kingdom, who was rightful Successor to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and a good Catholick in his heart, although af∣terwards out of Policy he was fain to appear otherwise.</P>
<P>Again, what sign of Christianity doth there appear in a Prince who assists Count <HI>Tekely</HI> in league with the <HI>Turks</HI> against the Empe∣rour? A King who forbids all Bishops and Curats throughout his Dominion to cause <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be sung for the Victories of the Chri∣stians obtained over the <HI>Turks,</HI> who impedes by force of <HI>Lewisses</HI> the progress of the King of <HI>Polands</HI> Forces against the same <HI>Turks,</HI> that they may have the opportunity to employ all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces a∣gainst the Emperour, thereby to make him abandon what he hath got at the dear rate of so much Christian blood.</P>
<P>What Christianity do you observe in the Kings proceeding at the Cities of <HI>Genoua</HI> and <HI>Orange,</HI> where he hath no right at all: So that by all that I have alledged, all these Titles of most Christian and Ca∣tholick Zeal the King is so much taken with, and affects, is only a deceitful mask of hypocrisie to lull the Catholick Princes asleep, the better to play his game, and make himself Master of them one af∣ter another. Although the King of <HI>England</HI> would hinder him, as being the only man that could best do it, he would endeavour to cause an insurrection of the Church of <HI>England</HI> men against him, he would send them Money and Officers as he did to <HI>Cromwel;</HI> so that one may say of the <HI>French</HI> King that he becomes all things to all men, when his interest is at stake: He enters into Covenant with <HI>Turk</HI> or <HI>Hugue∣not, Pagans</HI> or <HI>Infidels,</HI> against Catholicks themselves, if it be necessa∣ry for promoting his greatness, and to attain to the Monarchy of all <HI>Europe.</HI> And for a conclusion this is the Kings Religion, and your Wit and Policy of <HI>France.</HI></P>
