<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>By the Lords</HI> De Witt, <HI>Councill-Pensioner;</HI> Vrij∣bergen, Van der Hoolck, Kann, <HI>&amp;</HI> Gerlacius, <HI>their Deputies &amp; Plenipotentiaries at present beeing in the</HI> Wielings, <HI>for expediteing &amp; over the Employ of the said Fleete, after a curious examineing of the chief Officers, Commanders, &amp; Captaines of the foresaid Fleete.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet upon the 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5, of June successively, with se∣veral winds &amp; calmes beeing gotten to Sea out of the <HI>Texsell:</HI> And through contrary winds or calmes not beeing able before the 8. to sett course accord∣ing to order given to approach the <HI>English</HI> Coast; were with sayling, stop∣ping of tides, &amp; driveing, on the 11. fol∣lowing in the morneing, advanced unto about seven or eight Leagues East South East from the <HI>Northforeland,</HI> beeing the point of <HI>England,</HI> which stretcheth out between the Channel &amp; River of <HI>London:</HI> where the said <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet, through contrary wind &amp; stream, were necessitated to Anker.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> [who with their Fleet some dayes before were ankered in the <HI>Downs,</HI>] on the foresaid 11 June 1666. [probably upon intelligence of the approach of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleete,] put to Sea from thence with their Fleete, about noone apro∣ached neere the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet, which <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet beeing then all together were eighty three Ships strong, namely Fregats men of warre, besides advise Boates, Fireships &amp; other small Vessels; but by accident even before the beginning of the work, &amp; but one hour before the Battel began, one of the capital Ships of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet, commanded by <HI>Colonell Gent,</HI> through stamping of the Sea, lost first his Bowsprit &amp; af∣terwards his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oremast in the sight of the enemy, &amp; beeing unser∣viceable by order of <HI>Gen. de Ruyter</HI> as Admiral &amp; chief Commander of the Fleet aforesaid was sent up to <HI>Holland,</HI> the aforesaid <HI>Coll. Gent.</HI> beeing before gon over aboard the Ship of <HI>Cap. Godskens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English Fleet</HI> as they then were told by the <HI>Neitherlanders,</HI> were about eighty sayle strong; it was judged one a clock in the af∣ternoone when each began to fire at the other, the <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> Ships haveing before cutt their cables, because it was impossible through the hollow Sea &amp; shortnes of time in any wyse to gett their Ankors onboard. Both the Fleets therewith beeing under saile stood together over to the Southward the wind beeing <HI>W. S. W.</HI> by which meanes the Esquadron of the L. Admirals <HI>Tromp,</HI> &amp; <HI>van Meppelen,</HI> to whom particularly was assigned the Reare∣guard (haveing lyen at an Anker to the South westward) be∣came the Vanguard. And he the said L. Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> shewed himselfe valiant &amp; resolute in the foremost &amp; heaviest of the fight; &amp; hee was also manfully seconded by his <HI>Vice-</HI> &amp; <HI>Reare Admirals,</HI> &amp; other Officers. Whereupon immediately according to order the Esquadron of <HI>Generalde Ruyter</HI> &amp; <HI>L. Admiral van Nes,</HI> fell in with the enemy &amp; with their chief Officers &amp; Captaines signally quitted themselves. Presently after about 3. or 4. a clock after∣noon an <HI>English</HI> Fregat of the <HI>Blew Esquadron</HI> carryng by ghesse 50. Guns, so soon as he was past the <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> side having recieved from him the last salute sunk a little a stern of him.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>The Esquadron of the <HI>L. Admiralls Cornelius Evertson</HI> and <HI>Tjerck Hid∣des de Vries,</HI> could not at the first get up to the enemy, for that they were so farre to windward of them, whereby it was very fiercely fought on both sides, each Fleet keeping the same course till about 5. of the clock in the astternoone, when the <HI>English</HI> having tacked made North Westward, and were the most part of them forced to beare up before the wind, as is judged to avoid the <HI>Flemmish Banks,</HI> &amp; then the Esquadron of the <HI>Admiralls Cornelius Evertson</HI> and <HI>Tjerck Hiddes de Vries,</HI> came also into a fierce combat whith the enemy, who likewise with their whole Esquadron praise-worthyly and courage∣ously quitted themselves. And in the winding off of the <HI>English Fleet</HI> some of their leeward-most Ships were cut off, which were then pre∣sently boarded &amp; each by one <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ship overcome and accor∣dingly brought up in <HI>Holland.</HI> The one named <HI>Swiftsure,</HI> mounted with 70. Guns, most of them brasse &amp; commanded by <HI>Sir William Barckley, Vice-Admiral</HI> of the <HI>white Esquadron,</HI> who (courageously de∣fending himselfe against his overcomer, namely <HI>Henry Adrianson,</HI> com∣manding the Ship <HI>Hern,</HI> mounted with 73 Guns) was in person slaine. The other named the <HI>seven Oakes,</HI> with abouth 60 Guns, was overcome by Capt. <HI>Vander Saen,</HI> commanding a Freggat of 52. Goteling. And the third named the <HI>Loyal George,</HI> with 44. Guns by <HI>Capt. Jacob Andreas Swart,</HI> commanding the Ship <HI>Deventer,</HI> mounted with 66. Guns, all three Captaines belonging to the Admiralty of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> On the other hand in the first Attaque two <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships the one named <HI>Duivenvoord,</HI> carrying 64. Guns, of which was Capt. the Young Heroe <HI>Otto van Treslong,</HI> &amp; the other named the <HI>Court of Zeeland,</HI> carrying 58. Guns, of which was <HI>Capt. Simon Block,</HI> both fell on fire as is judged by burneing tamkins shot out of their owne or other <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships, by the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce of the wind dryven back into the foresaid Ships. In the abovesaid Ship of <HI>Cap. Otto van Treslong,</HI> were the <HI>Prince of Monaco,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Earle of Guise,</HI> beeing carried on by a couragious zeal, who both of them happily &amp; in utmost perill were first saved in the Ship <HI>Small Holland</HI> upon which is Commander <HI>Capt. Evert van Gelder,</HI> Brother in the law to <HI>Gen. de Ruyter;</HI> &amp; after came over into the Ship of the foresaid <HI>Gen. de Ruyter.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>In the foresaid Attaque was the Ship of L. Adm. <HI>Tromp</HI> found to bee so damaged in his Masts, that by mischance another <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ship comeing onboard him lost all his Masts; also the Ship of Reare Admirall <HI>van Nes</HI> about the same time had his Foremast shot by the board, so that both were necessitated as to their persons to goe over into other Ships, where they againe let fly their respective Flaggs, &amp; as before with great valiantnes continued to doe their endeavour as formerly, &amp; the foresaid mastles Ships presently according to orders given were sent up &amp; towed out of the Fleet for <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> as above having turned &amp; passing by the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet, their Ad∣mirall &amp; beside him some other Ships of his Fleet came to an Anker, but shortly after seeing that <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> with his Fleet under him had also turned &amp; was comeing uppon him, they chopped their Cables &amp; there fell betwixt them a very hard &amp; heavy long-dureing fight; in which through Gods grace none of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships miscarryed. But betwixt seven &amp; eight of the clock in the evening one more of the capitall <HI>English</HI> Ships of the Blew Esquadron, car∣rying by estimation betwixt 60. or 70. Guns, beeing past by the Ship of the <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> about a Musket shot, went to the ground; Both which <HI>English</HI> Ships sunk close by &amp; even amongst the <HI>Nei∣therlands</HI> Fleet, so as the same was perfectly seene by very many Of∣ficers, Private Seamen &amp; Souldiers, beeing donne before their eyes &amp; remarqued by them; but it cannot certainly bee affirmed whether any other <HI>English</HI> Ships might be sunke or destroyd that day: But towards evening the Reare Adm. of the White beeing a capitall Ship of war &amp; made very unserviceable by <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> &amp; others shot, there was commanded upon him one of the Fireships of the <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> Es∣quadron, which being gotten onboard him &amp; presently set on fire, the said Fireship was forth with sunke; whereupon a second Fireship out of the <HI>Zeelands</HI> Esquadron did likewise come onboard the said R. Adm. and set him on fire but the said R. Adm. cleared himselfe &amp; each time found meanes to put out the fire in his Ship. A third <HI>Neither∣lands</HI> Fireship under the favour of the Guns of the L. Adm. <HI>Cornelius E∣vertson</HI> endeavouring to lay the said R. Adm. onboard was before hee
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>was fast, shott to ground and sunk, so that according to the a∣greeing witness of all the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Officers which were there a∣bouts, the often mentioned Reare Admirall of the White, with a spe∣ciall constancy, as an honorable Souldier hath quitted himselfe: And it is the more to be admired because that [according to the witnes of some <HI>English</HI> Prisoners who leaped out of his ship into the sea, &amp; were saved by the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships at what time the forefaid two first Fi∣reships came onboard him] beeing on fire, three hundred of his Seamen, accounting the matter desperate (and to decline the fire) leaped over board, and chose the water. Out of the foresaid Reare Admirall in the evening late an unhappy shott was made which tooke out of the world the valiant L. Adm. <HI>Cornelius Evertson,</HI> whose good conduct and courage in many foregoeing occasions, as also in this was experimented; and thereuppon for that time was the fight parted by the Night, soe that through the darknes in the smook and damp, it could not bee marked whether the foresaid Reare Adm. might be sunk or have cleared and saved himselfe.</P>
<P>The Night beeing past the <HI>English</HI> Fleete on the 12 Iune 1666 with breake of Day was to windward above the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleete about a league &amp; halfe; the wind then beeing West South West, at which time both the Fleetes againe laid one towards the other, to wit, the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet Northwest and the <HI>English</HI> South over: So soone as the two Fleetes, were approached nigh each other, the <HI>Neither∣lands</HI> Fleete did also ly towards the South to stand the same course with the enemy. But the <HI>English</HI> setting aside the advantage of the wind bore up uppon the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet and accordingly did run before the wind amongst their enemies, the <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> keeping their course and bideing uppon a wind, running over against them, soe that both Fleets did in this manner passe with a heavy and sharp fight, without loseing any one single Ship of the <HI>Neitherlanders.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can any of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Officers as yet give testimony to the <HI>Deputies</HI> and <HI>Plenipotentiaries,</HI> of the <HI>States Generall,</HI> that of a cer∣teynty any of the <HI>English</HI> Ships were taken or destroid in the said ren∣contre. The Fleets being past each other in this manner &amp; on both
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>sides many Ships in their standing &amp; running rigging much dama∣ged by shott, each with spliceing, wallknotting and otherwise againe sought to make fitt, &amp; there uppon it beeing faln quite still, both Fleets lay and drove in a calme till about 11. of the clock before noone: When the gale increasing both Fleets laid towards each other (the <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> then beeing to Windward) and againe fell into a very furious fight. The <HI>Generallde Ruyter</HI> being advanced about halfe way in the <HI>English</HI> Fleete, heard in the midst of the same very fu∣rious shooteing, and from thence presumeing that some Ships of the Fleete under him must bee in a streight &amp; totally surrounded by the enemy resolved with his Esquadron under him to fall in; And hee presently bearing up ran in amongst the enemy, who uppon his comeing makeing some roome, hee saw and found that the <HI>L. Ad∣mirall Tromp,</HI> then in person beeing in and letting fly his flagg uppon the Ship of <HI>Jacob Cornelius Swart,</HI> had with a souldiers heart broken in there, and together with <HI>Vice- Admirall van der Hulst, Captain Pe∣ter Salomonson, De Haen,</HI> and <HI>van Amstell,</HI> lay very much disen∣abled surrounded by the enemy: All which without the aforesayd succor were in great danger to bee burned or sunk, as indeed the fore∣mentioned Ship of <HI>Peter Salomonson</HI> was at the comeing of the fore∣said succour already on fyre and thereby then lost. The aforesayd Captayn and a good part of his seamen were in utmost perill and just in their Extremity saved by the <HI>Neitherlanders;</HI> But it pleased God that hee (beeing gone over upon the Ship of Captayn <HI>Schey,</HI> and there according to his power doeing worthily,) dyed during the battell in the bed of honour.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Ship of <HI>Capt. Swart,</HI> &amp; of the aforenamed three other Captains, were, dureing the time of the said surrounding made so unserviceable, that the <HI>L. Admiral Tromp</HI> was necessitated again to goe over upon another Ship; And the aforenamed Ships of Vice-Admirall <HI>van der Hulst,</HI> &amp; the foresaid <HI>Capt. de Haen, Swart</HI> &amp; <HI>van Amstel,</HI> as being wholly unusefull, must bee sent up to the first &amp; fittingest heavens. In the aforesaid throng amongst others Vice-Admirall <HI>van der Hulst</HI> was also shot dead, who in all occasions had
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>carryed &amp; leported himselfe as a brave Souldier &amp; understanding Of∣ficer. Yet it pleased God the Lord in a short time doubly to repayr the foresaid loss &amp; dammage of the Ships of the States of the <HI>Vnited Neitherlands;</HI> for many of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet were the same day sunk &amp; burned. Amongst which there is remayning the perfect knowledge &amp; notice of these following Ships: Namely,</P>
<P>First, One of the Esquadron of the <HI>Red,</HI> beeing according to ghesse a Ship of about 60 Guns, sunk about noon amongst the fore∣most Ships or in the van of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>Secondly, One of the Blew Esquadron, carrying by ghesse be∣tween 50 &amp; 60 Guns, sunk about three of the clock in the after∣noon, after hee had passed by <HI>General de Ruyter,</HI> &amp; in passing by him was duely saluted.</P>
<P>Thirdly, One of the <HI>White</HI> Esquadron, carrying according to ghesse near 50 Guns, a little time after was sunk by the syde of Vice-Admirall <HI>de Liefde,</HI> who had so boared him through with his Canon that he went to the ground.</P>
<P>Fourthly, One of the Esquadron of the <HI>White Flag,</HI> carrying about 50 Guns by computation, about halfe an hour after was sunk in the Esquadron of <HI>General de Ruyter,</HI> a little behind the Ship of <HI>Capt. van Meewen,</HI> who gave him a full lower tyre in passing by. And that it may certainly bee concluded that both the foresaid Ships of the <HI>White</HI> Esquadron, are two distinct Ships it is to be noted that many Of∣ficers &amp; seamen saw the one as wel as the other ruined: to wit, the same persons that had seen the one sunk saw the other sunk also a short time after: whereof examination is carefully made to be sure that one &amp; the same Ship should not bee taken for two distinct Ships.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The Ship the <HI>Black Eagle,</HI> or <HI>Armes of Groening,</HI> beeing the last Autumne (after that the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet by an heavy storm were dissipated from each other,) met by the <HI>English</HI> &amp; taken; which foresaid Ship the <HI>Black Eagle</HI> was sunk, <HI>Capt. Marrevelt</HI> having with fore-consideration prepared &amp; fyred his whole broadside upon it.</P>
<P>Sixtly, Another <HI>English</HI> Ship sunk in the middest of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, after he had sayled for some time with a Flag of distresse with∣out any mans comeing to his help.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<P>In the aforesaid two dayes as also in the fight of the fourth day (of with hereafter shall bee further spoken) there were undoubtedly se∣verall English Ships burned of which neverthelesse no full certeynty of testimony can be given, in regard that some syre Ships were set on fyre &amp; yet it cannot bee perfectly said whether the Ships which they were aboard of were burned or that they cleered themselves. Except onely two <HI>English</HI> Ships, which many bee certainly affirmed dureing the fight to bee burned, one uppon the second the other uppon the fourth day of the foresaid Battel, for as much as the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Offi∣cers and Seamen that served uppon the Fireships, come in with good certificates to obtaine their setled reward for that service.</P>
<P>When the <HI>English Prisoners</HI> fisht out of the Sea, and sent to the re∣spective Colledges of Admiraltyes, shall bee perfectly examined to un∣derstand out of what Ships they are particulary saved, undoubtedly yet more of the burned and sunk <HI>English</HI> Ships will bee discovered.</P>
<P>The Fight of the foresaid 12. of Iune, was very fierce especially in the afternoon, so that many Ships on both sides were very much damni∣fyed in their Masts, ropmasts, sayles &amp; rigging: Amongst others about 3 or 4 of the clock in the afternoon was the main Topmast of <HI>Gen. de Ruyters</HI> Ship shott downe falling with Flagg &amp; pendant from above. Hee there uppon being something unfitted gave order presently to L. Admirall <HI>van Nes</HI> in meane while till that another Topmast should bee set againe to lett fly the pendent under his Flagg, &amp; for that time to acte as <HI>Generall,</HI> orderly to prosecute the fight. The which also was followed by him with such courage &amp; conduct that both Fleets came up three times one towards the other that afternoon &amp; so hav∣ing passed each other towards the evening when the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> fleet had turned the fourth time toward the <HI>English</HI> they followed their course &amp; with all their sayles made towards their owne coast; they body beeing lessened toeight or nine &amp; thirty men of warre; the <HI>Neith∣erlands</HI> Fleet standing towards them (who were by their tacking got a good way asterne,) did use all possible endeavour to fetch them up, to that end makeing all the sayle they could. But the night &amp; calme co∣meing up, were, next to Gods will, the cause that the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>could not reach them. The <HI>Gen. de Ruyter</HI> with his other sailes so much as he could keepeing neer the Fleet got in the mean while his maine Topmast, Flagg &amp; pendant againe set up &amp; all brought into fitting posture, &amp; did againe on the 13 his office as <HI>Generall.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> with breake of day discerneing that the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships continued all possible endeavour to fetch them up, sett their mastles and ill say∣ling Ships in fire, that they should not fall into the hand of their ene∣my, and used all meanes to fetch the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> setting to this end Topgallantsayles, Spritsayles, Lysayles, &amp; Drabblers, yea also wet∣ting their Sailes &amp; setting all to worke that could any wayes further or help them, the wind then East &amp; afterwards East South East, with a small gale. How many was the number of the Ships that for the cause above said in the morneing were sett on fire, could out of the <HI>Nei∣therlands</HI> Fleet with no perfect certainty bee marked, the number beeing by one made greater than by another, but the <HI>English</HI> in their <HI>Gazette</HI> of 4/14 to 7/17 June 1666 printed at <HI>London</HI> by publique authority [wherein they adscribe to themselves the Victory,] say that 3 Ships dureing the retreat, by order from their <HI>Generall</HI> were set on fire, to wit, the Ship <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> &amp; two other slugg Ships, of which the names are not there printed. The foresaid retreat continueing the whole day the <HI>English</HI> approached so neer the sands lying before the fore∣said <HI>River,</HI> that their <HI>Admirall</HI> of the <HI>White,</HI> named <HI>Sir George Ascue,</HI> with the Ship <HI>Prince Royall</HI> under him, mounted with ninety Brasse Guns beeing the biggest &amp; capitalst Ship of their whole Fleet, came a ground uppon a certaine sand named the <HI>Galper</HI> a grievous mischance for a Souldier, who dureing the whole Battel had quitted himselfe manfully, &amp; now not otherwise but according to order of his <HI>Generall</HI> was retireing; &amp; although the foresaid <HI>Admirall</HI> in this manner being come a ground, made signes with shooting &amp; otherwise for helpe &amp; assistance yet neverthelesse all the Ships of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet &amp; name∣ly the rest of his owne <HI>Esquadron</HI> held their course: so that he beeing now alone bereft of force to resist &amp; forsaken by all succour should have been burned by two <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships, which came presently up to him, had not L. Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> being then
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>uppon the Ship of Reare Admirall <HI>Sweers</HI> given signes to the aforesaid Fireships to forbear, because that uppon the Ship of <HI>Admirall Asc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> the Flagg was strucken, &amp; so thereby as by other signes it was sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wd that quarter was desired; vvhere uppon the Seamen of the aforesaid Reare Admirall <HI>Sweers</HI> by order of I. Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> vvent on∣board the forenamed <HI>Ascue,</HI> &amp; brought him over vvith some of his Officers &amp; people as Prisoners uppon the foresaid R. Admirall <HI>Sweers,</HI> &amp; the next day in the morneing by order of <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> sent the foresaid <HI>Admirall Ascue</HI> vvith a Galliot to the <HI>Hague,</HI> &amp; although the a∣foresaid Ship the <HI>Prince Royal</HI> aftervvards gott afloat againe, yet ne∣verthelesse because it vvould much incumber the Fleet <HI>Generall de Ruy∣ter</HI> ordered that the Ship should be burned, &amp; the People saved, which presently vvas accordingly effected.</P>
<P>About the same time towards the evening there came out of the Southwest twenty two <HI>English</HI> Ships of warre, commanded, as was afterwards understood, by <HI>Prince Rupert,</HI> who as is now certified the day before vvas sent off into the Channell &amp; there &amp; in the Haven of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> &amp; <HI>Plimmouth</HI> vvas to gather some more Ships to him &amp; so together to run &amp; meet the <HI>French Fleet</HI> under the Command of the <HI>Duke of Beaufort,</HI> &amp; attacque them. Likevvise there came, out of the <HI>River of London</HI> as is judged, certainly from the <HI>English Coast,</HI> three other great Ships of vvarre, makeing together a nevv re-inforce of 25 good men of vvarre. The <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet seeing the fore∣said nevv succours to approach, the <HI>Zeeland</HI> &amp; <HI>Viiesland</HI> Esquadron made tovvards them, but the aforesaid body under <HI>Prince Rupert</HI>-decline them, &amp; ran tovvards the <HI>English</HI> Fleet or the remainder of them, vvherevvith he conjoyned late in the evening. The vvhole <HI>En∣glish</HI> Fleet beeing then in all with the foresaid new Re-inforce sixty or sixty one good ships of vvarre strong, vvhereof so notable a part vvere vvholly fresh ships. The <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> on the other hand vvere then together about sixty four ships of vvarre, but all by a fight of tvvo dayes &amp; chase of the enemy the third day, much dama∣ged &amp; tyred out, beeing but the remainder of their Fleet; three have∣ing been sunk or burned as is above related, others vvith their taken
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>prises gon for <HI>Holland,</HI> others either mast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es or tovving mastles ships sent out of the Fleet. The matter novv standing in these terms the <HI>Neitherlanders,</HI> vvhich novv savv a considerable Battel to bee expected having this night (to decline the sands &amp; have more room) vvith a small saile stretched Eastvvards on: The <HI>Generall de Ruy∣ter</HI> in the morneing early first called a <HI>Councill of Warre</HI> &amp; after∣vvards also made a sign to all his Captains to come aboard, &amp; having exhorted them all to doe their endeavour as also given them orders according to which they were to regulate themselves, the Battel was a∣gain begun the 14 of June forevvritten in the morneing about 8 of the clock, betvvixt the <HI>Foreland</HI> &amp; the <HI>Flemmsh Banks</HI> in the open sea about 8 leagues from the Land, the Wind beeing South south-east, vvhere∣by the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet haveing the vveather gage did vvith their three Esquadrons in three distinct places break into the enemy &amp; fought through them, wherewith the <HI>English</HI> were somewhat dis∣persed. This beeing donne <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> tacked againe with the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet &amp; stood over Southwards towards the enemy, who on the other hand rallyed themselves. This was re-iterated three severall times distinctly, whereby it was fought neer this whole day very fiercely on both sides with uncerteynty of the issue. Dureing this furious fight one of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships of warre commanded by Capt. <HI>Vytenhout</HI> was fyred &amp; after sunk. One of the <HI>English</HI> Fireships seeing the Vice Admirall <HI>de Liefde</HI> disabled &amp; lying with his main∣yard downe, attempted to lay him on board; but was by the <HI>Vice-Admirall</HI> &amp; by Capt. <HI>William Bowdewijns</HI> turned off. Thereafter another <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fireship that by a shott was fired fell aboard that Fireship &amp; they burned both together. On the other side a <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fire∣ship attempting to board and fire the Ship of <HI>Prince Rupert,</HI> the which in this short time was much battered, one of the <HI>English</HI> Fireships which attended on the foresaid <HI>Prince</HI> came aboard the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> fireship &amp; thereby both the foresaid fireships as also another <HI>English</HI> Ship which unhappily fell in with them were burned. In the meane while was the L. Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> with the a forenamed Ship of Rear Admirall <HI>Sweers</HI> &amp; some other Ships with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a long conti∣nued
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>&amp; furious fight with the enemy wholly disenabled so that hee was forced with his foresaid Ships to abide out of the fight that they might as much as was possible fit &amp; bring themselves in posture agayn. <HI>Gen. de Ruyter</HI> [although by this means the Fleet under him was dimi∣nished in a considerable number of capital Ships] neverthelesse seeing that the sun began to grow low, resolved [without tying himselfe too much to the advantage of the wind] to make the appoynted sign ge∣nerally &amp; together with all the Esquadron to break in uppon the ene∣my. Where uppon the L. Adm<SUP>s</SUP> <HI>van Meppelen, de Vries,</HI> together with Vice Adm<SUP>s</SUP> <HI>Banckert, Schram</HI> &amp; <HI>Coenders,</HI> as also the R. Adm. <HI>Brunysvelt</HI> &amp; all the Captaines which were to windward resolutely breaking in &amp; every one doeing his endeavour, it fell out that the L. Adm. van <HI>Nes</HI> &amp; the Vice Admirall <HI>De Liefde</HI> with the R. Admirals van <HI>Nes</HI> &amp; <HI>Evert∣son</HI> &amp; some others Ship beeing to lee-ward of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet &amp; the <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> with the rest of the <HI>Neytherlands</HI> Ships to Windward; they so streightned the middle of the <HI>English</HI> Fleete betwixt them both the sayd Fleet beeing by this means attacqued both before &amp; behind, that the enemy after a sharp fight of an hour &amp; half, not willing as it seems to bee boarded by the <HI>Neitherlanders</HI> Ships, betook themselves the second time againe to flight &amp; thereby fell wholly into confu∣sion &amp; rent in pieces. The <HI>White Flagg</HI> with eight or tenne <HI>English</HI> men of warre bore away before the wind northwards with leesayles set, &amp; the <HI>Admiralls</HI> of the <HI>Red</HI> &amp; <HI>Blew Esquadrons</HI> by the wind ran over towards the <HI>English</HI> coast hoysing up all the sayles that they could. The <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships which uppon the aforesaid signall of the <HI>Gen. de Ruyter</HI> could lay a board any <HI>English</HI> Ship, mastered it: Amongst others the R. Adm. <HI>Brunsvelt</HI> boarding two of the enemies Friggats that lay fast together hee alone overcame both the foresaid enemies Ships; But in this confusion as appears took no sufficient order for the keeping possession of the two a foresayd prizes, whereby the <HI>English</HI> af∣terwards made themselves masters of them againe: but some time after Capt. <HI>Pawes</HI> observeing it, retook both the fore said rescued Ships; but the one named the <HI>Bull</HI> which could not longer keep the Sea nor bee brought in to any haven was soon sunk, the other named the <HI>Essex,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>a faire Fregat with 58 guns not very much damaged is brought up in∣to the <HI>Texell.</HI> The like accident of beeing retaken is hapned to ano∣ther <HI>English</HI> prize. The Vice Admirall <HI>Coenders</HI> did at the same time overcome &amp; bring up accordingly into the <HI>Texell</HI> the Ship called the <HI>Clovetree</HI> mounted with 62 guns; which the last yeare was taken by the <HI>English</HI> from the State of the United <HI>Neitherlands.</HI> Likewise also Capt. <HI>Ruth Maximilliaen</HI> at the same time did master &amp; hath brought up into <HI>Goree</HI> the Ship named the <HI>Convertine</HI> mounted with 54 guns. Besides these uppon the forewritten day according to the knowledge of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Officers there were two <HI>English</HI> Ships sunke, to witt, one of the Esquadron of the <HI>White</HI> which sunk in the evening, &amp; the other a little time thereafter, it beeing not without likely hood that more other <HI>English</HI> Ships are destroyd of which the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Of∣ficiers have not full knowledge and therefore of that particular no∣thing can bee certainly affirmed by them.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> finding themselves in this desolate posture &amp; follow∣ed by the <HI>Neitherlanders, God the Lord;</HI> [which by his almighty hand had brought the worke thus farre] as appears did not please that they should for that time bee brought into farther ruine, or fall in to the hands of the <HI>Neitherlanders.</HI> His <HI>Divine Majesty</HI> this evening about seven of the Clock very suddenly caused a thick mist to come up, du∣reing the which the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet, having chased the enemy 4. glasses was at last forced to forbear the further prosecution, least chaseing the enemy upon uncerteynty &amp; as it were by groping they should scatter &amp; dissipate themselves, which acording to rules of Sea affayres should have been most unadvisedly don; yea not to bee ans∣wered. Wherefore the <HI>Gen. de Ruyter</HI> by the ordinary sign-shotts gathered the Fleet together, which lay driving with a small sayle the whole night, but the next day morneing beeing the 15 of June afore∣said noe <HI>English</HI> Ship could bee descryed no not from the topmasts of the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Ships. The battel &amp; prosecution of it, there-with had an end: The <HI>Generall de Ruyter</HI> the same day with the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet beeing strong sixty Ships of warre arrived in the <HI>Wielings</HI> according to order, that beeing the rendezvous appoynted by the State.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
<P>Nine others, beside the forementioned Ship of <HI>Coll. Gent,</HI> beeing, part dureing the fight &amp; part after the end of the Battel, either unser∣viceable or come into <HI>Goree,</HI> to bring up their Prizes; Ten others for like reason successively sent towards the <HI>Texell</HI> as belonging thereto; And the remaining four were as is here above related burned or sunk, making together 843 which with one light Fregat of the <HI>Maes</HI> used for an advise-boate, amounts to the number of 85 Ships of warre: which number the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Fleet did consist of, besydes Fireships, Advise-boates, &amp; other Vessels when they set sayle from before the <HI>Texell.</HI> And wee understand that the remainder of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet having endeavoured with all diligence to fetch severall of the next Havens they could, did the most part of them get in at <HI>Harwich.</HI></P>
<P>For which Victory the inhabitants of the <HI>Confoederate Neitherlands</HI> are bound to give the highest thankes unto God the Lord, who hath given them so eminent a Victory. For according to the stedfast &amp; constant witnes of the Officers that have been in the Fleet, &amp; also according to what appeares by bringing up of Prises before our eyes, three &amp; twenty Ships of warre of the enemyes are ruined or taken &amp; brought up, &amp; amongst them especially one <HI>Admirall</HI> &amp; one <HI>Vice-Admirall,</HI> besides those which without the knowledge of the foresaid <HI>Neitherlands Officers</HI> may be burned, sunk, or come to other mis∣chances: And on the contrary in a fight of four dayes no more then 4 <HI>Neitherlands</HI> Men of warre all of particular although valiant Cap∣taines are lost; &amp; not any thing thereof is faln into the enemies hands for their rejoyceing.</P>
