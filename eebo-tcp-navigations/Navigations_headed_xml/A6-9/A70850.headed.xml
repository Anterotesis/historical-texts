<HEAD>The Famous HISTORY OF <HI>Valentine</HI> and

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>Chap. I.</HI> How the Lady <HI>Bellisant,</HI>
sister to King <HI>Pepin,</HI> was solemnly married to the Emperour of
Greece, and how they departed towards <HI>Constantinople.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here Lived a worthy and re∣nowned King in the famous Kingdom
of <HI>France,</HI> called King <HI>Pepin,</HI> who had one on∣ly sister,
whose name was fair <HI>Bellisant;</HI> this beautiful Lady was no less
vertuous than comely, nor <PB REF="4"/>no less
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then prudent, than both. She
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly beloved of all sorts
of people: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> loved her for
her Clemency, the Gentry loved her for her fidelity, the Com∣mons loved her for
her sweet behaviour, and the poor loved her for her Charity.</P>
<P>The same of this gallant Lady resounded not only through the
Principal Povinces of <HI>France,</HI> but through all the whole world; from
one end to the other; so that to this La∣dy came many a Princely Potentate,
hoping to gain her good will in Marriage. Amongst the rest of her noble and
renowned Suppli∣ants, came the high and mighty Emperour of <HI>Greece,</HI> who
after many daies spent in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> atchieved the
beauteous La∣dies love; and with the consent of her Bro∣ther and all the
Nobility, he took her to wife; where a long and spacious time was spent in
feasting and merriment, to solem∣nize the Royal and Nuptial bonds of
Ma∣trimony, which were made between the Em∣perour and fair
<HI>Bellisant,</HI> Sister to the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But now behold what came to pass on the sudden: There came a
Post sent from <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> to certifie the Emperour, that
there was like to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great
insurrection and <PB REF="4"/>combustion in many of his Provinces, ex∣cept
his Highness would be pleased to make a speedy return to his own Country,
thereby to pacifie the outrages of the people, and re∣new a settled
peace.</P>
<P>The Emperour and his friends having ta∣ken the matter into their
consideration, how that Divisions might be a means to raise mute∣nies,
and mutenies to raise seditions, and sedi∣tions to raise civil wars,
and that civil wars might bring ruine and destruction, both on himself and
all his adherents for ever: There∣fore he rather chusing to forsake his
pleasures in <HI>France,</HI> than to endanger the ruine of his own Kingdom,
took leave of his Brother the King of <HI>France,</HI> and the rest of the
Princes and Nobles of his Court; he prepared him∣self with his fair Bride,
for their journey un∣to their Court at <HI>Constántinople.</HI></P>
<P>Their departure caused great heaviness at the Court,
insomuch that there was never more sorrowful hearts, grieved minds, and
weeping eyes than at that time, for the de∣parture of that modest and well
governed Lady, who with her Lord in short space ar∣rived at their desired
Haven.</P>

<PB REF="5"/>
<HEAD><HI>Chap. II.</HI> Of the treachery Practised by the
Arch-Priest of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> against the fair Empress
<HI>Bellisant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NO sooner was the Emperour, and his fair Empress arrived at
the Port of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but they were entertained with as much
joy and Solemnity, as if the Gods themselves had descended from
<HI>Olym∣phus,</HI> to give welcome for those long lookt for Guests: and
for a congratulation they pre∣pared all manner of dainty fare, all manner of
rare Musick, and all sorts of rich Orna∣ments fit for their wearing.</P>
<P>Many Kings, Princes, Lords, and La∣dies came from other
Countries, and pre∣sented many Rich and costly Gifts to the royal and
beautiful Empress, the Lady <HI>Bel∣lisant;</HI> and happy were they that
could have so much Favour, as to kiss her Princely hand.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Morpheus</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> distracteth and
troubleth Love-sick persons, whether they sleep or wake, so doth
Fortune and en∣vy act their parts of cruelty and tyranny <PB REF="5"/>amongst
the chief Monarchs and Princes, as may appear by those Golden Pair of
Turtles, the Emperour and his loving Mate. In that Court of great Magnificence
there lived a supposed Religious man, whose title was Arch-Priest, or
Arch-Bishop: but he proved himself to be an Arch-Traitor, as you shall
presently hear.</P>
<P>This Arch-Priest was a great Favourite to the Emperour, and
so well thought of in the Emperours Court among the Nobility, that
whatsoever he said was a Law: For if there was any one had any business
with the Emperour, they could not get admittance without the Arch-Priests
consent: Which the Empress <HI>Bellisant</HI> perceiving, thinking him to
be a just and upright man, afforded him the like respect as others did, and
often∣times in secret would reveal her mind unto him.</P>
<P>Upon a time it came to pass, they being all alone together, he
being filled with lust and carnal desire, burst forth in these words
unto her.</P>
<P>Most beauteous, fair and comely Lady, I your humble and
devoted Servant, with all the respects belonging to such a noble
perso∣nage as you are, desire the grant of one boon <PB REF="6"/>unto, which
if you perform, I am a liv∣ing man, if you deny, you are a dead wo∣man.</P>
<P>The Lady hearing him say so, answered him in this
manner;</P>
<P>Sir, I am as yet but a stranger in this Empire, but yet will I
afford you any thing that is mine to give, so far forth as reason doth
require, and that my Princely Husband gives way to.</P>
<P>Then Madam, quoth he, this it is, I de∣sire your love,
insomuch that I may embrace the sweet and pleasant enjoyments of your
love, and to do with you according to my will.</P>
<P>When the Lady heard him talk; and find∣ing him to be lustful
minded, she spake unto him in this manner.</P>
<P>O thou dissembling hypocrite, thou false and faithless
tyrant, thou blood sucking traytor, thou perjured villain, how canst thou
for shame ask such a question of me? Didst thou not once swear to be
true to thy Lord and Master, and wilt thou now go about to ravish his
espoused Wife? Depart from me, and for the fault thou wouldest have
committed ask God forgiveness, and keep thine own counsel, and I will no
fur∣ther <PB REF="6"/>speak of it. When the wicked wretch had received his
denial, he presently depart∣ed the Room, vowing to be avenged of the Lady:
and so having laid a platform of mis∣chief in readiness to work his
design, went to the Emperour, and spake unto him in this sort.</P>
<P>O my Noble Lord and Master I that have been all times well
known to your self your true and faithful servant, and beloved of all men
for my loyalty to your Highness, I am now with grief of heart enforced to
reveal a secret unto you, which is of great concern∣ment: and this it is,</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>Bellisant</HI> your wife, which you thought to be
so vertuous, chast, and honest, is known and found to be otherwise; For
why, she hath conspired your Death, acted Treason against your
person, and the Child which is now in her Womb is of another mans begetting:
and therefore Noble Sir, I think there is no better course to be taken, than
to send her away to <HI>France,</HI> from whence she came, and that
suddenly and privily, that the world may not take notice of what is done.</P>
<P>When the Emperour had heard this strange Relation from the
false dissembling <PB REF="7"/>Arch-traitor, his wrath was so much
infla∣med, that he had neither the Patience nor power to forbear, but
presently ran into the Room where his harmless Lady was sitting all alone
in her solitary dumps: So taking his advantage, ran streightwaies unto her,
and taking hold of her hair, pulled her to the ground, beat her on the face
with his Fists, and stampt upon her with his feet, insomuch that the
blood issued out from her Nose and mouth so violently, that the like
was hardly ever seen.</P>
<P>But at last, when he had tired himself with abusing this
Lady, he stood panting for breath, thinking to have gone to her again.</P>
<P>Mean while she was recovered upon her knees; and as she was
kneeling, she spake to him saying,</P>
<P>O my dear Lord, what is the reason that without cause you
deal thus cruelly with me? I desire you, my good Lord, to spare me my life;
if not for my own sake, yet let it be done for the Infants sake which is
yet unborn.</P>
<P>Well quoth the Emperour, I will spare thee thy Life, but this
shall be thy doom, that thou shalt for ever be banished from my
pre∣sence, <PB REF="7"/>and be sent to thy brother in <HI>France;</HI> with
a writing upon thy brest, for all that look on thee to read, how that for thy
disloy∣alty to thy Husband, for thy Treacherous plots devised, and for the
acting the part of a Strumpet, thou art banished the Royal Court of
<HI>Constantinople;</HI> and therefore pre∣pare thy self to night to be
gone to morrow, for here is no longer time for you to abide.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Chap. III.</HI> How the Empress <HI>Bellisant,</HI>
being banished by the Emperour, travelled into <HI>France,</HI> and the
strange births of <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Orson.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW when morning was come, the di∣stressed Lady
<HI>Bellisant</HI> was set on horse∣back, according to the Emperours
command, having no other company to go along with her, but one man which was
her servant, and came out of <HI>France</HI> with her. Now mark what happened
to them in their journey: for the Proverb saith that one Swallow doth not
make a Summer, neither doth one misery go by it self.</P>
<P>As they were passing through a huge and spacious
Forrest, the Lady found her self grievously distressed: and being
great with Child, alighted from her horse, and sent her servant to seek
some woman to help her in her extremity, she sitting the whilest under
the boughs of a tree. The Gentleman with diligence made all the haste he
could possibly do, but before he returned back again the Lady was delivered
of two Sons, of which an ugly she-Bear coming along, <PB REF="8"/>caught one
of them up, and ran away with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, carrying him to her
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, to be a prey
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or her young ones. The Lady
pursued the bear to recover her son, but in vain, she be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng also so weak, that she
could not return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the place
where she had left her other Son.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the mean time, the King
having that day been on hunting, chanc'd to find him, taking him up and putting
him to nurse, calling his name <HI>Valentine;</HI> Of whom you shall hear
more hereafter, in the subsequent discourse of his History.</P>
<P>The Bear (as by providence it came to pass) never devoured the
child that she car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied to
her Den, nor had her whelps any power at all to do it any harm, so that as
the Bears young ones did suck her, she gave suck
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the child also, till
such time that he became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to shift for himself. And when he came
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be of the age of a man, he
had humane sence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike a
man, but had not the speech nor use of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny language at all, and was
all overgrown with hair like unto a Bear, because he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uckt of the Bears milk, he
was also as wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any
savage beast that was in the Forrest,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd did so many strange
exploits, destroying of men and women, that none durst come near the place
where he was.</P>
<PB REF="9"/>
<P>The other brother was brought up in the Court of
<HI>France,</HI> by the means of King <HI>Pe∣pin,</HI> which was his own Uncle,
although un∣known to them both; and they called his name <HI>Valentine,</HI>
and the wilde mans name they called <HI>Orson.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="9"/>
<HEAD><HI>Chap. IV.</HI> How <HI>Valentine</HI> conquered
<HI>Orson,</HI> and brought him to the Royal Court of his Ʋncle King
Pepin.</HEAD>
<P>THis <HI>Valentine</HI> was of such a Noble and heroick
courage, and gallant behaviour, that he was known to be the chiefest and
ablest man at Arms that was in all the noted Court of <HI>France,</HI> and
would encounter any man that came to oppose him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Valentine</HI> hearing the strange reports of
<HI>Orson,</HI> how he overcame and conquer∣ed all that ever came near him,
resolved on a time to try his valour, courage and magna∣nimity, and venture
his life with the wild man <HI>Orson,</HI> not thinking he had been his
brother.</P>
<P>And thus being couragiously mounted on horseback, (rich and
gallantly clad in Armour bright, with a most excellent sword by his side)
he rode to the spacious Forest, to find out the wild man, which he quickly
did; and upon his near and sudden approach, he found him prepared for the
Combate, and rea∣dy to encounter him; for indeed <HI>Orson</HI> ne∣ver 
<PB REF="10"/>went unprovided of his great Weapon, which was a mighty Club, made
of an Oa∣ken tree: with which at the first salute he gave
<HI>Valentines</HI> Horse such a bang on the Nose; that he beat out his
brains; and then was <HI>Valentine</HI> bound to fight for his life, for to fly
it was in vain.</P>
<P>Thus was the Combate with great courage renewed, and
<HI>Valentine</HI> with his sword and <HI>Orson</HI> with his Club fought
along time, and drew much blood of one another: But at the last
<HI>Valentine</HI> through skill and policy van∣quished <HI>Orson,</HI> who
was far more stronger than himself: and having obtained an abso∣lute
conquest, immediately after brought him bound to the King of <HI>France,</HI>
where many strange and wonderful atchivements were performed by those two
Noble brothers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="10"/>
<HEAD><HI>Chap. V.</HI> How <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Orson</HI>
went to assist the the Duke of <HI>Aquitain:</HI> where <HI>Orson</HI>
conquered the Green Knight.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VAlentine</HI> and <HI>Orson</HI> remaining in the Court,
there arrived a messenger from the Duke of <HI>Aquitain;</HI> who bring
admitted into the Kings presence, said as followeth: Most Mighty King, my
Master the Duke of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> intreateth your Majesty to
commi∣serate the sad condition of him and his coun∣try, being invaded by a
Pagan, called the Green Knight, upon no other cause but to take away his only
daughter, the fair La∣dy Fezon, which he hath sworn to effect, un∣less by
some worthy Christian Knight he be vanquished within forty daies: many
have already adventured against him, all which he hath overcome, and hanged
upon Trees. My master therefore humbly craves your Ma∣jesties
assistance in this extremity. The King hearing this, promised him aid,
and the mes∣senger departed.</P>
<P>The next day the King, with many hardy Knights amongst whom
was <HI>Valentine,</HI> who <PB REF="11"/>also caused <HI>Orson</HI> to go
with him, being na∣ked, except an iron Jacket, which <HI>Valentine</HI> had
caused to be made for him, set forward towards <HI>Aquitain,</HI> where the
Duke enter∣tained them as befitted such Royal persona∣ges, declaring all
the deeds which the Green Knight had done, and the conquests he had made.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> hearing this, determined to try the might of
this Champion: So arming himself, he rode to his Tent. The Green Knight
seeing him, presently mounted his steed, and between them began a most
cruel Combate, both giving and receiving many wounds; at length the Green
Knight said, Knight, thy valour causeth me to pity thee, therefore I
advise thee to give over: For none can overcome me but the son of a King
who never suckt the breast of a Woman, now if thou art such a one thou
maist over∣come me, if not, thy fighting is vain. Not∣withstanding
<HI>Valentine</HI> continued the fight till night parted them, and both betook
them∣selves to rest.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> considering the Green Knights words, and
that himself had suckt the breasts of a woman, determined to send
<HI>Orson</HI> to try his fortune with the Green Knight: So the <PB REF="11"/>next day <HI>Valentine</HI> put his armour upon <HI>Orson,</HI> who
being mounted, rod to the Green Knight, between whom began a most fierce
combate, <HI>Orson</HI> giving him many wounds, which he immediately healed
with Balsome that he had about him for that purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Orson</HI> seeing this, thought it in vain to use his
sword any longer, sith he could heal him∣self so quickly; and casting
it away, he betook himself to his Nails, where with he so rent his armour,
and wounded his flesh, that he was constrained to fall, and submit
himself to the mercy of the conquerour. The King, <HI>Valentine,</HI> and the
Duke being joyful of this victory, went to the Green Knight, who im∣mediately
relinquished all his former pre∣tensions, consenting to become a
Christian, and be baptized. So after some few daies spent in mirth and
triumph, the King, <HI>Va∣lentine</HI> and all the Noble Peers of
<HI>France,</HI> so∣lemnly took their leaves of the Duke, and his fair
Daughter the Lady <HI>Fezon,</HI> and re∣turned again to the Court.</P>

<PB REF="12"/>
<HEAD><HI>Chap. VI.</HI> How the Treason of the Arch-Priest was
dis∣covered, and how the Emperour re-called the Lady <HI>Bellisant</HI>
from banishment.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus presented you with the dis∣loyal proceedings of
the Arch-traytor, I shall now return to speak of what became of him, who
so perfidiously sowed the seed of sedition between the Emperour and
the Lady <HI>Bellisant.</HI></P>
<P>The Arch-Priest persisting still in this wicked quality,
alwaies acting and plotting Treason against one or other, he thought at
last to have been made Emperour himself: But it came to pass, that by a
miraculous means his treachery was found out, and he arraigned for treason,
who having the sentence of Death pronounced against him, confessed.
That he had been a most horrible forsworn and perjured Villain, and that he
had been a means to divide the Emperour from his gra∣cious and faithful Lady,
and how that all the things that were laid to her charge were false.</P>
<P>This and many other of his faults he <PB REF="12"/>openly
confessed before the Emperour and the rest of his Noble Lords: but as the
<HI>Old Pro∣verb</HI> saith, <HI>For his open Confession he had open
Punishment:</HI> being adjudged for to ride upon a bare ridg'd Horse, with
his face towards the Horse tail, then to be set three daies with his
<HI>Ears fast nailed to the Pillory and then his body to be taken and thrown
into a Cauldron of boyling Lead,</HI> which was a just reward for a
forsworn Traytor. And afterwards the Em∣perour sent for his Queen and
settled her in her Royal Throne of dignity again, where they lived many happy
years in joy and tran∣quility. And as for their two valiant Sons,
<HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Orson,</HI> they became the bravest men at Arms
that ever <HI>Christendom</HI> afforded: They conquered Gyants, subdued
Sarazens, overcame Cities, destroyed Castles, and fought many famous and
renowned battels against the Enemies of <HI>Christendom,</HI> insomuch
that the whole world admired at their couragious enterprises and fortunate
success.</P>
