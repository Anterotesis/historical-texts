<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VPon a late dispute and engagement between the two Navyes at Sea, great was the resolution and gallantry on both sides; and for the space of ma∣ny hours the Victory seemed doubtfull; but in the heat of the Conflict, Divine providence proved a Banner to the Par∣liaments party, and Fortune so attended their severall mo∣tions in their heroick atchievements, that they soon became Victors over their insulting Enemies, and in a short space
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>dispiersed that formidable Fleet, who for many moneths have lain raging upon the Neptune Seas, and forbed the two unfortunate Princes to take sanctuary in Harbours; so that now the Citisens of <HI>London</HI> may receive comfort from the Ocean, and the Marchants and others proceed unanimously in free Trade and Commerce without fear or molestation; The faciliating whereof, may cause thousands to rejoyce, and sing hallelujah, for the vanquishing of this potent Ene∣my; it being affirmed, that since our first engagement with them we have re taken above 30 ships and prizes, 200 pie∣ces of Ordrance, and at least 400 prisoners. We hear that Prince <HI>Charles</HI> upon the 15 instant, with the Prince, and Prin∣cesse royall about sixe of the clock in the morning went to Dort, so far the Queen of Bohemia, brought him on his way. The 11th of June the Electoresse of Brandenburg, went toward Cleave, by Vionen, Rhenea The 17th of June, Prince Charles went from Breda toward Bruxels; where an Earl hath order to receive his highness. Therr is a Col. left in the <HI>Hague,</HI> who is to buy arms for ten thousand men. There passing a boat from England to Ostend, with divers English they were set upon by some English, who lie there and rove to get booty. The Passengers were in great fear at which one of them stood up, and said to the Pyrats, I have lately broke out of New gate, being a prisoner for King <HI>Charles,</HI> and these are all my friends, therefore do them no harm? at which they cryed, <HI>Vive la Roy,</HI> and bid them passe there should none of them be toucht.</P>
<P>They tell us that come from Edenburgh, that Scotland is quiet, and that the Parl. hath no enemy in arms, in any part of that Kingdom, which is sufficiently confirmed by the soul∣diers beginning to be unruly and unseparable concomitant to idlenesse, which hath been complained of by the Parl, and Ministers, which occasioned the Gen. Excellency, the E. of
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Levin, write to the Liev. Gen. that there might be a meeting of all the chief officers, for redresse or all grievances, and for ordering matters, so that nothing might obstruct the work in hand: the particular which fercht in this Gen, was that there were English Cavaliers scattered up and downe in the army, some whereof had entertainment, others shelter which actions it were necessary to remove, and retain only those who of them were honest Covenanters. There is dis∣pleasure taken, that letters between Newcastle and this place going for Scotland, were intercepted and opened, which is likely to procure the like, and is already threatned; displea∣sure is apt to catch: Dr. Sibbald the Phisitian, is discharged of his imprisonmen. upon the Fine of 500. Scotch marks, he saith let them take what they wil, he wil not recant his pa∣per, and will rather choose to suffer the most ignominious death at the openest plece in Edenburgh.</P>
<P>The Gent. that brought the letter from Parl. of England, of having neither countenance nor answer, nor is like to have if the deportment be evidence of respect to this nation, ther's little if an answer should be returned, as it's unlikely, or not like to be sodain, it wil be sent in all probability by messen∣gers of their own.</P>
<P>The Commis. are at last returned from their declared King and landed at Kirkaldy: the pure Royalists say that there is no agreement brought (whether with joy or sorrow these expressions are made appear not the Sages and know∣ing Divines seem chearfull and expresse that Scotland hath cause to blesse God for the great condiscention or so much compliance in their King, and this seems to be the more pro∣bable; yer some begin to think it may now be in their power to act or speak at least in favor of their friends in England.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Louthian,</HI> and the rest of the Commissio∣ners are returned from the young King, with a mes∣sage and answer to the Proposals and Desires of the Parliament; wherein he declares, <HI>That he is willing to give his Condescensions to those things, which may stand with his honour and safety, and the liberty and freedom of his people, but doth wholly decline the taking of the Covenant, or to grant to what they last delivered in, saying, That for the establishing of the Presbyterian Government, the granting of a generall Act of Oblivion, and the composing of all differences whatsoever vnhappily sown and sprun vp amongst his people, he will give his Royall assent therevnto and therefore requires them to hear∣ken to him, and not to proceed no further in contest, He being assured, that he had friends enough amongst them, that would joyn with him, and endeavor the sacrificing of all that was neer and deer vnto them, for his just restitution, in restoring of him to his Throne and Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>After which, his Highnesse had a conference with the Lords of his privy Councel, wherein he further remonstra∣ted, <HI>That he conceived it requisite to decline sending over any forces into Scotland, vntill such time that the result of the Par∣liament was known touching his last Answer and Condescensions and not to hazard an engagement with the Parliament of Eng∣land and the Army, vnder the conduct of the Lord General</HI> Fairfax <HI>and Lieut. Gen.</HI> Crumwell, <HI>till the next Spring</HI></P>
<P>At which Conference most of the Nobility seemed to re∣scent the same with great alacrity, declaring, That they did very well aprove of his Highnesses motion, and that it would prove very prejudiciall to the advancement of his Cause, if they should engage before he be both powerfull and po∣tent.</P>
<P>But indeed there is little probability of faciliating that
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>Design; for we hear that their displaying of the Royal game at Sea hath quite broken the neck of their design at land, &amp; that upon their losing of so many brave ships and prizes, many hundreds ashore have wholly deserted, and in stead of becoming masters at Sea, and become the slaves thereof; insomuch, that the coast is cleer, and commerce free for the Citisens of <HI>London,</HI> which otherwise might have been ob∣structed.</P>

<P>Sir, Since the receipt of the last message from the young King, to the Parliament, in answer to their former Propo∣sals and Desires, much time hath been spent in debate there∣of, and after some Result thereupon, voted, That the said Concessions are unsatisfactory, and (in paat) very destruc∣tive and prejudiciall to the peace of that Kingdome. The General Officers both of Horse and Foot, and the major part of the Souldiery, of the Scottish Army, have declared, That they will in no wayes comply with the Royal party, for the establishing of <HI>Charles</HI> the second, untill such time that he hath given full satisfaction to all interests whatsoe∣ver, in reference to the safety and preservation of their just Rights and Liberties; and to that end are resolved, to keep a faire correspondency with the Parliament and Army of England, for the prevention of future misery, and suppressi∣ng of all insurrections. Some of the Scots horse are ad∣vanced towards the borders of England, for the inlargment of their quarters, and easing the oppressed of that Nation.</P>

<P>There is news from Ulster of speciall note but the report goes severall ways, which for more certanity a way is ta∣king, some say 20000 have met together and declared for Ormond, others that they have reneued the Covenant, and upon a Declaration, shewing upon what terms, they will joyn with Scotland or Ormond; and have agreed that a let∣ter be sent to their King, telling him if he content not the Scots Kingdom, he is likely to lose Ireland. From the premi∣ses where no doubt there is a vein runs through those Island of the same metle, wherein, no doubt there is brimstone or Sulpher Plenty.</P>
<P>Sir, Those who come accidentally out of Ireland for no letters are come from Dublin speak with confidence, that Owen Roe Oneal is joyn'd wit some 500. Col. Monk had, and they are come from Dun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alk toward Dublin; to joyne with Col. Iones and jointly to take the field against Ormond who is still buried with taking little Garrisons: wherein he is not long. The inclination of the Souldiery, being so great as to be courted out of them, and perticlarly that of Donade not many miles from Dublin, is delixered up by Major Smith as the reporter sayth.</P>
