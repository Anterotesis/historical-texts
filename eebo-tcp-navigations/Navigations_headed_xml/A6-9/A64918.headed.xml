<HEAD>The Victory over the Fleet of the States General, obtained by His Majesties Navy Royal in the late Engagement, begun the <HI>25 July</HI> instant.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ʋnday</HI> 22. Instant, not with∣out difficulty, we got the Fleet through the <HI>Narrow;</HI> about Six in the Evening we came to an Anchor short of the <HI>Buoy</HI> in the <HI>Gunfleet,</HI> within Six Leagues of the Enemy, who came to an Anchor off of the <HI>Sledway.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 23. Both Fleets weighed, and plyed to and again with little Wind, and that Night proved very Tempestuous.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> 24. It blew hard, and we were forced to keep to an Anchor till about Two in the Afternoon, and then stood off to the Eastward, and Anchored about Eight Leagues from the <HI>Nesse.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> 25. By Two in the morn∣ing we weighed Anchor, and by Day∣light we had the Enemy under our Lee: Sir <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> led the Van to the East∣ward, with our Larboard Tacks aboard, the Wind North-East; and as soon as he came to the head of the Enemies Fleet, which was at Ten of the Clock, we gave the Signal to bear in in a Line, our selves with the Red Squadron in the middle, and Sir <HI>Jeremy Smith</HI> with the Blew, bringing up the Rear. We plyed them so close, that they could not Tack upon us; and so we continued fighting till about Four in the Afternoon, and then <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with the main Body of his Fleet gave ground, whom we pursued with the Red and White Squadrons, leaving Sir <HI>Jeremy Smith</HI> with the Blew Squadron, engaged with <HI>Van Tromp</HI> and a Squadron of their Fleet. All Night we followed the Enemy, and again next Morning as soon as it was light we began the Chace, and were in great hopes of taking <HI>De Ruyter;</HI> but the Wind being little, he spoomed away be∣fore it, so that our smaller Fregats could hardly get up with him. And by Ten a
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>Clock <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning, we had pursu∣ed them as far as the <HI>Durlow,</HI> which was about Eighteen Leagues, and there he lay till about Two in the Afternoon; which time we were so near the Banks of Sand, that we could not make the Chace any farther, and <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> and those with him, had opportunity to run into that place.</P>
<P>In this Chace we possessed us of Two of the Enemies Great Ships, the one a Vice-Admiral of 60 Guns, 24 of them Brass, and 290 Men, commanded by <HI>Adrian Bankaert;</HI> The other the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of <HI>Haer∣lem,</HI> of 66 Guns, 320 Men, Command∣ed by <HI>Ruart Hellibrant;</HI> both which we set on fire, not being willing to spare any Men to bring them off, after we had ta∣ken all their Men out of them. As soon as we gave off pursuit of the Enemy, we called a Council of Flag-Officers, and whilst they were with us, we discovered some Sails N. W. of us, and heard a shooting, which we judged to be Sir <HI>Je∣remiah Smith</HI> fighting <HI>Van Trump</HI> and his Squadron: Whereupon we de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermined to draw off the Fleet, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>deavour
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>to intercept them before they got into their Harbours.</P>
<P>Upon the Appearance of these Fleets, we found the Wind at N.E. they stand∣ing right in, and we right out, as close as we could lye, and stood up till we could see their Squadron, and Sir <HI>Jeremiah Smith</HI> chasing of them: After we came fair up with them, we Tacked, and stood in the same way that they did; and about Twelve a Clock at night, came to an Anchor, taking part of the Leeward Tide, to draw them upon us; which fell out within a League, as we expected it: But by the morning we perceived Sir <HI>Jeremiah Smith</HI> had lost <HI>Van Trump</HI> in the Night, and was now out of sight; so as the Wind having varied to the Ene∣mies Advantage, they stood into the Land of the Island of <HI>Schawen,</HI> towards the <HI>Baniarts,</HI> and we stood in after them with the <HI>Royal Charles,</HI> to six Fathom Water, where now we are expecting what the Enemy will do.</P>
<P><HI>This is word for word his Highness Prince</HI> Rupert, <HI>and his Grace the Duke
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>of</HI> Albemarle's <HI>Narrative of this last En∣gagement, their Modesty in relating, equal∣ling their Valour and Conduct in maintain∣ing the Fight; the summe of which success is, That on the</HI> 25th. <HI>the fight began with equal numbers,</HI> 90 <HI>Men of War, and</HI> 17 <HI>Fireships on each side; after five hours close fighting, the greatest body of the Enemy bore away towards their own Coast, and on the</HI> 26th, <HI>that body was totally broken, and beat∣en into their Harbours, whither the</HI> 27th. <HI>the rest followed, broken and beaten in the same manner; our Fleet being Masters, and keeping the Sea, and at this present lying upon their Coast, with the loss of one Ship onely burnt, out of which the Captain, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were saved: and this after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had bragged through the World that they had blocked up our Fleet in the Ri∣ver of</HI> Thames, <HI>and had brought a Land Army with Tooles, and all other Materials to conquer</HI> England, <HI>or at least to set it on fire in all parts: What effectually the Enemies loss was, more then is told herein, as well by Ships burnt as sunk, of which there can be no Prisoners to tell Particulars, we shall know in time, though their Art in dissem∣bling
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>them is always admirable; and the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>genuity of their former Relations hath been such, that we cannot but look that they should ring their Bells, make Bonefires, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Narratives to all the Courts in Chri∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dom of their great success now. God grant them more of this kind, and let us thank∣fully prostrate our selves before him for the great Valour and Conduct of our Generals, and the Ʋniversal bravery and vigour with which all the Commanders, Seamen and Soul∣diers sought in this happy occasion, for the service of their King, and honour of the</HI> En∣glish <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
