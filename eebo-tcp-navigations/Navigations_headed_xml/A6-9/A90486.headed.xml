<HEAD>A Letter sent to the Councel of State, touching the late fight between the English and Dutch neer Fortland Road on Friday and Saturday last.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Friday last about five of the clock in the morning, our Generals resolved to fight the enemy; and after seeking the Lord for a blessing in this great work, we engaged their whole Fleet con∣sisting of about 80 sail, who were convoying neer upon 300 Merchants homewards; we were not above 60 sail, yet disputed it till 7 of the clock in the Evening, great execution being done on both sides, as appears by the inclosed Narrative and List. The fable night ending the dispute, both fleets lay neer each other with their Lights forth; and on Sa∣turday morning the fight began again, which was with great gallantry maintained by Gen. Blake, with his own Squadron, viz.</P>

<P>All which, bare up to the enemy with so gallant a spirit of resolution, that (by the assistance of General Monk with the Vanguard and others) before 3 of the clock on Friday, we had taken, sunk, and fired 15 sail, whereof one is their Vice-Admiral, a stout ship of 60 Guns; another, their Rear-admiral, a gallant ship, and fought bravely; indeed, so they did all; but General Blake having got the wind-ward of them, charged with such an irresistable and magnanimous spirit, that Vantrump endeavoured to decline en∣gagement, which his Excellency perceiving, imme∣diatly pursu'd; so that a third and fourth conflict hapned; during which disputes, the famous Triumph (to the perpetual eternizing of the Generals fame be it spoken) received neer upon seven hundred shots, wherein was slain that noble and approved souldier capt. Ball, with some others; besides many wounded; amongst the rest, the General himself re∣ceived a wound upon the Thigh by an unhappy splinter (but its hoped not dangerous) which splin∣ter took away part of General Deanes breeches, but
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> not any part of his body at the least hurt. In this fight Captain Mildmay, and Captain Barker, de∣ported thsmselves with singular dexterity and cou∣rage; but at last received their mortal wounds; to∣gether with our Secretary, whose deaths are much lamented. Both our Rear-Admirals have lost their Main-masts, but are got safe into portsmouth; we have also lost the Sampson, which was so extreamly rent and torn, that she was even almost full of wa∣ter; until which time, the Souldiers and Mariners resolved not to desert her; but at last was forced to eseape in boats.</P>
<P>The enemies loss is far greater; for we have sunk fired, and taken about 19, and are now in pursuit of them towards their own Coast.</P>
<P>Their Merchant-men are conceived lay up to∣wards the Coast of France all the time of the En∣gagement; and we doubt not but to give a good account of this memorable Expedition very sud∣denly. Vice-admiral Pen endeavored to come seaso∣nably in to our assistance, with 14 sail, from the Downs; but was prevented by cross windes; yet it pleased God he came timely to the pursuit. We are now in a gallant condition; since the Lord was pleased to crown the endeavors of our Fleet with happy success; for which we desire to magnifie his great and glorious Name.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He States proceed on vigorously in seting forth a new Armado; no less then eighty sayl is voted for, in case they receive not a Repeal from England: some Frigats are already off from the Stocks, and Dewitte is the onely man whom they now pin their faith upon; but that which renders them indifferent willing, is, their strange Fancies and new Gingles of infusing an incredible belief into the hearts of the people, viz. That your General Cromwel is confined to the Tower of London, for declaring for the Interest of young Charles, upon the Parliaments motion to make his brother the Duke of Gloucester King; saying, That in case they must have a King, they should take the right Heir; with many other falaci∣ous Devises, of the Lord Grey's drawing his Sword in the Parliament house against his Excellency, the creating of collonel Harrison General of the soul∣diery, and divers other circumstances of the like coyn, which will prove too light for these Artists of
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> the Flemish Mint. Nay, further, they retain such un∣pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allel'd atchievements of their Victors at sea, that all is like to be their own in England, forsooth; and nothing but Death and Imprisonment shall be the Reward and Portion of the Members of Parlia∣ment, without either Bail or Mainprize. Again, they please themselves very much with thoughts of strange mutinies among our men, both by Land and Sea, and divisions amongst your Governours, and Commanders, whereupon they expect a sud∣den change; and it is for certain reported, that Hull, Yarmouth, and the Divel and all, are revolted to the Royal party. And yet all this will not get in the In∣terest of Monarchy, though that party do pretend mountains of golden advantages thereby for the ta∣ming of the English: All that they do for him as yet, is, to give him free Port for such ships as shall by his commission sail. But now that the Zealand Lords are arrived here, somewhat more will be attempted, not onely for him, but also in the behalf of the O∣range Family. The Duke of Gloucester, with a very small Retinue, is transported from the Isle of Wight into Flanders; from whence comes a monstrous ru∣mour of a great Victory obtained by the Dutch; but where, no man knowes.</P>
