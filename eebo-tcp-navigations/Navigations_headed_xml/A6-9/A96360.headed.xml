<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE COVNCELL OF STATE for ENGLAND and JRELAND. ANDREWES BURRELL, <HI>Gent.</HI> Humbly presents this insuing <HI>Narrative</HI> or <HI>Journall,</HI> of all the Memorable <HI>Passages</HI> which were acted in the <HI>Downes,</HI> when the great Fleet of <HI>Spanyards</HI> were vanquished by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in the Year, 1639.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is now more then five yeares, since I first Complained of the sluggish and unserviceable condition of <HI>Eng∣lands</HI> Navie. In which Time there hath been wasted (by Mr. <HI>Greenes</HI> Accompt) to guard the Seas, (as he calls it) Seventeen hundred seventy five Thousand, 600 and 10 Pounds, or thereabouts. But the Seas are not Guarded, and which is worse, the Honour of the Seas is lost and shamefully lost. The truth is for want of Victuall and o∣ther due Incouragements (that is, for want of their Thirds, <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/></P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>This <HI>Journall</HI> shewes You, how those great Ships were In∣countred, dissipated, and destroyed by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> though <HI>Englands</HI> Royall Navie endeavoured seriously to protect and defend them.</P>
<P>With these Spectacles you may see cleerly, that Great slug∣gish Ships, mann'd with Land-men, are not serviceable for this State.</P>
<P>That fleet of <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, was much greater in Number, Tonnes, Men and Ordnance, then <HI>Englands</HI> Navie is, or ever was, but Maugre their Greatnesse, and Number. That Fleet was Incountred, and in a few houres, scattered and Con∣founded by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in their small Ships; for excepting some few, which of late yeares they have fondly framed in Imitation of the <HI>English</HI> Navie, (that is, for Countenance) All their Men of war, are small Ships, and doe carry but one Tyre of Ordnance.</P>
<P>I say in a few houres, they so confounded the Great <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Ships, that scarce one of ten Returned into <HI>Spayne.</HI></P>
<P>In this Great and memorable Fight, some of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships were Burnt, some were Sunck, and some were taken. The rest runne a-shore, or runne away; <NOTE PLACE="marg">This Ship wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not much lest in burthen th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>Royall So versigne.</HI></NOTE> and in their flight the great Great Admirall of <HI>Portugall,</HI> having 1100 Men, and 70 Pieces of Ordnance, was in part Blowne up, and her remaines burnt to Ashes; shee was not able to defend her selfe, much lesse to offend others.</P>
<P>If you compare the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armado, which came into <HI>England,</HI> in the yeare 1639. To that which came against <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in the yeare 1588. Your Honours, will find many Ships in <HI>Oquendoes</HI> fleet, of farre Greater force, then any of the Galeons, or Galleasses, which were so much admired by the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> (and by some fooles in <HI>England</HI>) when their In∣vincible Armado was Honourably Incountred, and put to flight.</P>

<P>When <HI>Van Tromp</HI> first encoun∣tred <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Antonio de Oquendo,</HI> in the yeare 16 9. His Fleet consisted of 17 Ships and Frigats, and there was but 3 of the 17 which carried two Tyres of Ordnance, all the rest were Ships of the fourth ranke in <HI>Englands</HI> Navie, or Ships of lesse force.</P></CELL>
<CELL><P>VVHen the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armado first encountred <HI>Eng∣lands</HI> Navie in the yeare 1588. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Armado consisted of 91 great Ships. 4 Galleasses, and 59 small Ships.</P>
<P>When <HI>Don Antonie de Oquendo</HI> first encountred <HI>Van Tromp,</HI> His Fleet consisted of 66 great Ships, fortified with One thousand, nine hundred twenty and foure Pieces of Ordnance. And besides his Sea∣men, hee had Ten thousand Land∣men in his Fleet.</P></CELL>

<P>Here note, That when <HI>Van Tromp</HI> did first fight with the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> it was upon a Retreat (as J may call it) which hee durst not attempt untill he had tryed what his Ships would doe for him; That is, hee durst not fight with them untill he knew by experience, that his Ships were nim∣bler then the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships; So that if hee were worsted, he might run from them, as indeed hee did, when he stayed for the 9. Ships which were at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which Ships soone after came to him in the Night, as you have it in the 5. page of this Journall.</P>
<P>Here you see, that nimble Ships are the Ships which must performe the desired service.</P>

<PB REF="6"/>
<ITEM>This last Report is very remarkable, it is of a greater Concernment then all the Passages in this booke; By it you may know, that <HI>Englands</HI> Navie is Contemp∣table, and must come behind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the great Ships which were prepared at <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Chatham,</HI> to ayd Sir <HI>Iohn Penington,</HI> were so long Wind-bound, that the Fight was ended three dayes be∣fore they came into the <HI>Downes.</HI> This mischiefe is usuall, and therefore very consi∣derable. Page, 36</ITEM>
<ITEM>That in all the Fights which were betwixt the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were to Windward of the <HI>Spanyards;</HI> which is the greatest Advantage that any Ship can have of her Adversary. Page, 42</ITEM>
<ITEM>That when the last great Fight began, Thirty of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were to Wind∣ward of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, which in my opinion was a high Presumption. But when the <HI>English</HI> Shot at them they did not returne one shot, which Honour is since layd aside, with the Expence of Two Millions, Foure hundred eighty five Thousand eight hundred fifty foure Pounds or thereabouts. Page, 44.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Conclusion of these Observotions is, That <HI>Van Tromp</HI> violated his Promise in falling upon <HI>Oquendoes</HI> Fleet in the Kings Road. Hee did not keepe his Pro∣mise with Sir <HI>Iohn Penington;</HI> For which affront, it had been equall and just, that <HI>Englands</HI> Admirall should have taken the same Liberty when hee was with the Parliaments Ships, at the <HI>Gorey</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> But no more of That.</ITEM>

And the resolution of the <HI>Dunkirks</HI> squadron was, that they would not shoot one shot at the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> nor give the <HI>Span∣yard</HI> any succour, except they did perceive that some of their Admirals were in danger to bee taken by the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and then they would doe their best to secure them, the which they likewise performed when the fight was, as hereafter I shall make mention.</P>
<P>This Information I received from Mr. <HI>T.

<P>For on the 5. of <HI>September</HI> following, <NOTE PLACE="marg">5.

These Ships were commanded by <HI>Don
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>Antonio de Oquendo</HI> principall Admirall, whose ship had 66 Pieces of great Ordnance, and his Vice-admirall was <HI>Don An∣drews de Castrewd,</HI> a ship with 56 Pieces of Ordnance, and the Admirall of <HI>Portugall</HI> his name was <HI>Don Lopez de Ossad,</HI> a ship of 70 Pieces of Ordnance, the 2 Admirals being brave old Men. There was also the Admirall of <HI>Sivell,</HI> and the Admi∣rall of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the Admirall of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with their Vice and Rere-admirals, but for their names and the strength of their Ships I was not so inquisitive as to give you any Rela∣tion thereof.</P>
<P>Presently after day light, this present day aforesaid, the wind being at N.

But the first broad side that one of the foremost ships
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> gave, by what accident no man knoweth, the Ship blew up all to pieces, but some of their men were taken up by the <HI>spanyards;</HI> which accident was much lamented by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for the losse of the Ship and Men, and like∣wise for the want of her force, being a good Ship of 36 Pie∣ces of Ordnance.</P>
<P>Likewise after this another mischanee hapned aboard their Vice-admirall <HI>De White,</HI> he having a barrell of Powder in his Round-house to fill Cartridges, which by negligence was fi∣red and blew up the Round house whereon the Drummer was beating his Drum, who was likewise taken up by the <HI>spanyards,</HI> the fire was presently quenched and not much disheartning to the <HI>hollander,</HI> but a mighty incouragament unto the <HI>spanyards,</HI> who did still pursue their Fight, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceased sigh∣ting at 3. after noone.</NOTE> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in a see∣ming flight behaved themselves so well, that at 3. a clock af∣ter-noon the <HI>spanyards</HI> began to grow weary, having his Masts and yards shot, strook his Top-sayles and lay by the Lee, and staid for the rest of his Fleet, and when they came up they all lay by the Lee together, to repaire their Masts, and rigging, upon which the <HI>Hollander</HI> run to Leewards off them out of shot, and likewise clapt his Ship by the Lee, and cald a Coun∣cell and sent a Frigot presently to call 9 other of their fleet from <HI>Duakirk</HI> road, <NOTE PLACE="marg">September,</NOTE> and gave him Instructions when he return'd with those 9 Ships, to shoot of 2 Pieces of Ord∣nance every quarter of an houre, and when hee was answered by one, presently after the discharging of his 2 Pieces,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. th</NOTE> 4 or 5 times one after the other, then they might be sure that it was their Fleet, and might thereby steere with them, albeit it were dark night or thick weather, the which as hereafter was care∣fully observed.</P>
<P>Towards night the wind shifted and came to the S.w. faire weather, they lay all night by the Lee, and untill after-noone the next day, before they could fit themselves, and were drove between <HI>Beachy</HI> and <HI>Faire-Lee,</HI> and towards night Sir <HI>Henry

Vpon which, both the Admi∣rall and Vice-admirall stroke their Flags, and hoyst them up againe, which was as much as could be required of them in the Sea. After which our Vice-admirall bore for the <HI>Downes,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet steer'd along to the Eastwards, very little wind Southerly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. th</NOTE> and the <HI>Hollands</HI> fleet continually running before them with a short sayle (and never shot shot one at another.

<P>About 10 a clock at night, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> heard two Pie∣ces
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>of Ordnance toward <HI>Calice,</HI> and they answered with one rejoycing to heare that their <HI>Dunkirk</HI> fleet were so neare un∣to them, who continuing shooting every halfe houre at first, and every quarter of an houre after they heard one another, and by two a clocke in the morning the tyde of Ebbe being spent, and the 9 Ships from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and the Frigot were joyned with them, they having got up their anchors, bore up, all together upon the Spanish fleet and steer'd with them, N. by W. But the <HI>Spanyards</HI> not being so vigilent as the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> was longer before they weyed anchor then they were, so that the Flood being come the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had falne to the Eastwards off them, had they not espied the Admirals Lant∣horne in the main-top, by the which light they bore all upon him, and gave him every one their broad side, and tore him exceedingly, and then to worke pell-mell with all the Fleet, and continued the fight, the Ordnance going off so fast, <NOTE PLACE="marg">8. th <HI>Sunday.</HI></NOTE> that it was a wonder to those that heard and saw them.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fight began againe, which was a very sore fight.</NOTE></P>
<P>The wind then at S. and by W. the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet hal'd o∣ver for the <HI>French</HI> coast, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to windward off them, still continuing their fight upon the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Por∣tugall</HI> squadrons, the <HI>Dunkirkers</HI> keeping still on the Lee∣boughs off them without shot, and all the <HI>Lubeckers</HI> and other ships that had the Soldiers in them, were a good birth a head of them all, some of them being as we did conceive that lookt upon them out of the <HI>Downes</HI> with prospective Glasses, were past <HI>Callice.</HI> About 9 a clock we could perceive one of the great <HI>Spanyards</HI> which prov'd the Admirall of <HI>Sivill,</HI> lie with her head to the westward, with her mayn-yard shot downe, and her mayn-top-sayle stroke; which Ship was taken by Capt. <HI>Forran,</HI> a valiant <HI>Frenchman,</HI> that was Captain of one of the States of <HI>Hollands</HI> small ships, he had the possession of the ship above an houre, &amp; not having men in his ship suffici∣ent to man her, hee did expect that some of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would have borne up unto him to spare him some helpe, to
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>carry her alongst with him. But whether it were out of En∣vie unto him, because hee was not of their Nation, and had taken so great a Ship with so few men, as it is greatly to bee suspected, for not one of them bore up unto him to ayd him. On the contrary side, the Admirall of the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> seeing one of the Admirals of his Fleet taken cast about to rescue him, which caused Captain <HI>Forran</HI> to rifle and pillage what they could, and tooke out the Captain and all the principall men of that Ship to the number of 70 Men, aboard of his ship and left her; after that the two <HI>spanish</HI> Admirals cast about, intending to relieve the Ship that was taken by <HI>Forran,</HI> but the <HI>hollanders</HI> did ply them so fast, especially the Vice-Admirall of the <HI>Holland</HI> fleet, (as the <HI>English</HI> men which were amongst the <HI>spanyards</HI> did relate unto us) that the <HI>span∣yards</HI> layd downe their Armes and would not fight; so that they shot not one Piece of Ordnance in almost halfe an houre the which wee could very well perceive out of the <HI>Downes;</HI> then the <HI>Dunkirkers</HI> fearing that their Admirals would bee lost, and those that had the Soldiers in them, which might have been in <HI>Dunkirke</HI> within two houres to follow Instru∣ctions, which was to follow their Admirall, they all cast a∣bout. The <HI>hollanders</HI> perceiving the <HI>Dunkirks</HI> making all the speed that they could to relieve their Admirals, knowing them to be resolute men of Warre, and fresh; and the Pow∣der in his Fleet being almost all spent, about 10 a clocke hee made Sayle and stood away to the Westwards from them, ha∣ving taken one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet, and as they afterwards reported, had sunke another, of the which I doubt; for they were not so farre from us but that wee could have perceived a Ship to sinke; and then hee stood for <HI>Calice</HI> to supply him∣selfe with Powder. <NOTE PLACE="marg">8.th Sunday.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> having left the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> and the tyde of Ebbe being spent, before they could fit the Admirall of <HI>Sivil</HI> to sayle, the wind being at South, and S. by W. except they
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>would have lost that Ship, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>September,</HI> 1639.</NOTE> the which the Admirall would not give way unto, and the flood being come they could not fetch over unto the <HI>French</HI> coast, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spen∣yards</HI> ancho∣red at the South fore∣land, and rode with Flags aloft,</NOTE> but was forced to beare towards the <HI>Downes</HI> and anchored with all his Fleet, between the South forland and <HI>Weymar</HI> Castle, which was 4, or 5 miles from us, where they rode with their Flags aloft, there being 65 Sayle of them.</P>
<P>His Majesties fleet that was then in the <HI>Downes,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>Iohn Penington,</HI> were the <HI>Ʋnicorne</HI> Admi∣rall, the <HI>Henretta Maria</HI> Vice-admirall, commanded by Sir <HI>Henry Mannering,</HI> the <HI>Antolope</HI> by Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> Rere∣admirall, the <HI>Bonaventure</HI> by Captain <HI>Richard Feelding,</HI> the <HI>Dreadnaught</HI> by Capt. <HI>Iohn Hall,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">What Ships were then in the <HI>Dewnes</HI> of the Kings.</NOTE> the <HI>Providence</HI> by Captain <HI>Rob.

<P>Sir <HI>Iohn Penington</HI> was very much discontented, that they should ride so neare him with their Flags aloft, but could not presently send unto them, the wind and tyde being against them that should goe; but at 5. a clock in the afternoone the tyde beginning to slack, Captain <HI>Robert Slingsby</HI> and Captain <HI>Edward Popham,</HI> was sent unto them to command them to take in their Colours. And when they came to the <HI>Spanyards</HI> they were courteoussy entertained, and delivered their message; to which the Spanyards replyed as they had formerly done unto our Vice-admirall, <HI>viz.</HI> That they did expect as much liberty in the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Roads as the King of <HI>Englands</HI> ships had in their Harbors, where they were suffered to weare their Colours without controll, yet rather then that should breed any difference, if our Admirals Instructions did reach so farre, as to command in their Flags, hee did intreat, that our Admirall would be pleased to send them a Command in writing, that he might shew it his Master at his returne, and
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>hee would presently obey his Command, <NOTE PLACE="marg">September, 1639.</NOTE>and withall desired that hee might have leave to come into the Road for the bet∣ter security of his Fleet; about 7. at night they returned with this Answer. Upon which, Sir <HI>Iohn Penington</HI> resolved not to send them any thing in writing, but gave order to those Cap∣taines to goe againe abord of them betimes next morning, to command them to doe their Obeysance unto his Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> who was Admirall of all those Seas, and to certifie them if they refused it, that hee would come with his Fleet and compell them thereunto. Vnto which purpose hee gave me Order at day light in the morning, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Munday,</HI> 9.</NOTE> to goe abord of all the <HI>English</HI> Marchant ships, great and small that were in the road to Command them to make ready to set Sayle, to goe along with the Admirall if hee did wey, and to assist him in what he should Command them to doe, the which I did very early in the morning; and in the meane time unmoored all our ships. Captain <HI>Slingsby</HI> and <HI>Popham</HI> likewise followed their Com∣mand by day light. But at halfe an houre past 7. a clocke, our Admirall sent me after them with his Pinnesse, to know the reason why their Flag was not stroke, and why the Captaines did not returne to give him their Answer, and in the meane time hee would get his Fleet and all the Marchant men loofe and turne it up towards the <HI>Spanyards;</HI> for if there were any delay they should not have tyde enough to get to them.</P>
<P>We rowed away with all speed, and when I came abord of the Admirall the Captain of the ship gave me entertainment, and led me aft unto the Admirall, who was in Councell with his other Captaines in the Gallery. But comming into the Cabbin, I found our two Captaines sitting there something discontent, that they could not have their Resolutions; unto whom I related my message, upon which they both went in∣to the gallery with me and shewed the Admirall, wherefore I was sent, they gave me civill entertainment, and answered me that they would doe any thing that our Admirall should com∣mand
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>them, but said that they were writing to him; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Septemb.</HI> 1643.</NOTE> to the which I made no answer having no <HI>spanish,</HI> but put the naile of my thumb to my teeth and gave a snap, and said;

<P>In the morning the <HI>Spanyards</HI> removed from amongst us, and wee did birth all the Kings ships according to our intent, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did all wey and tooke their births to the Southwards of us; but after noone Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> sent his Vice-admirall, and Rereadmirall, and some other Captaines to desire leave from Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> that some of their ships might ride to the Northwards of the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> fearing that some of the Spanyards might run away in the night, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wednesday,</HI> 11.</NOTE> to the which Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> made answer, that the Channels were narrow and the nights darke; so that hee was verily perswaded they could not, nor would not put it to such a hazard as to goe that way, yet he sayd, that if so be that they did doubt of any such thing, they might if they pleased send some of their Ships to ride to the Northwards in the mouth of the Gualls, and likewise at the

Amongst other discourse with Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> he said, that if the weather should storme up, as it doth usually at this time of the yeare, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Admirall <HI>Tromps</HI> ac∣compt made up what would be∣come of the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet</NOTE> <HI>Within short time the King of</HI> England <HI>would have all the</HI> Spanyards <HI>Guns; the Countrey people would have the Ships, and the Divell would have the men.</HI> Meaning that they would all drive a shore if not worse. As yet, the 8. <HI>English</HI> ships with the Souldiers for the most part rode amongst the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Penington</HI> sent to them to Command them to birth themselves to the Northwards of the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> but some of them could not wey their anchors, their men were so feeble with sicknesse, and indeed there was many Sea-men sick in all the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sunday,</HI> 15.</NOTE> This day came the second <HI>Whelp</HI> from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Burley</HI> certified our Admirall, that there was 13. sayle of the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet arived there with 3000 men. These were the Ships that ran away to the Northwards in the night which are formerly mentioned, the wind being all this day between the SE, and S.S E. which caused the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to rejoyce, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monday,</HI> 16.</NOTE> for with those winds they did expect more ayd.

<P>All these Masters J commanded to bee ready to assist the Admirall to the uttermost of their power, if any occasion should present it selfe by any Fight between the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Spanyards.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tuesday,</HI> 17.</NOTE> This day there came a Packet from the Lord Admirall to our Admirall, wherein was mentioned that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Embassador, upon a letter that he had received from Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> made a complaint of our Admirall, that he should say unto Capt. <HI>Cats</HI> Rere-admirall of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and some other Captaines, that hee sent abord unto Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> to desire leave that some of his Ships might ride to the north∣wards of the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> as is before mentioned the 11.<SUP>th</SUP> day, That hee would ingage his head that the <HI>spanish</HI> ships could not nor should not goe to the Northwards in the night; o∣therwaies he would have sent ships to the Northward to look unto them, the which did trouble our Admirall exceedingly. And the next day in the morning, hee sent Captain <HI>Richard Fielding,</HI> Capt. <HI>Robert Slingsby,</HI> Capt. <HI>Edward Popham,</HI> and my selfe, abord of the <HI>Hollands</HI> Admirall, to justifie that our Ad∣mirall did never ingage himselfe unto Capt. <HI>Cats</HI> and the o∣ther Captain, that the <HI>Spanyards</HI> should not goe out to the Northwards in the night; for wee did all of us heare all the Conference that past between our Admirall and Capt. <HI>Cats,</HI> and we gave him to understand that our Admirall did not take it well from him, that hee should write such falsities of him unto their Embassadour. To the which Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> an∣swered, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wednesd.</HI> 18.</NOTE> that he had writ nothing but what his Rere-admirall Capt. <HI>Cats</HI> had related unto him; which was, that Sir <HI>Iohn Penington</HI> did say, that hee would ingage his head that the <HI>spanish</HI> ships could not nor should not goe out in the Night. But Capt. <HI>Cats</HI> being there present, denied in secret unto us
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>that he never mentioned, should not, but that his Admirall had added that unto the message that he brought him, and as I conceived thereby the better to cleer himself from his neglect of sending some ships to Ride in the Cha∣nells to the Northwards as aforesaid, But <HI>Cats</HI> durst not openly deny it, fort hen he should have given his Admirall the lye: so the fault was wholly laid upon Capt. <HI>Cats,</HI> with the which answer we returned. Afterward I was sent again single aboard of Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> as it were to give him a visit by my self, and to have an hour or twoconference together, to which he had divers times invited me familiarly &amp; called me brother, hoping thereby to get something out of him being single more then we could when there was more com∣pany with him. But I could not learn from him, that he had as yet received any other instructions from the States then his generall instructions; albeit that he had divers times writ un∣to them for some other instructions, what he should doe in this particular businesse; But as yet could hear of any, only that they did leave all to his discretion, which did much trouble him (for saith he) if so be that the <HI>Spanyards</HI> should begin to stir from thence, if he did not begin with them be∣fore they were wholly out of the Road when they came a broad many of them if it were a gail of winde would es∣cape them; and again on the contrary if so be that he should begin with them in the Road, then he doubted that we would take part with the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> whereby a breach might be made between his Majestie and the States of <HI>Molland,</HI> which would not easily be reconciled, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18. <HI>Wendsd.</HI></NOTE> if so be that the States should allow and support him in what he should do in this kinde.</P>
<P>But he doubted that rather then the States would have any difference with his Majesty they would leave him to the mercy of the King, and then said he it may be that I may be hanged for my good service. Wherefore he resolved not to begin nor
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>do any thing in the Road unlesse they gave him warrant for it; also in our discourse he demanded of me how many ships we had of the Kings and Marchant men that we had taken up in the Road? I answered that we were four or five and twenty Sayle: well said he, you are so many, and the <HI>Spanyards</HI> are 50 Sayle, and we are (said he) of our Fleet 50 Sayle, I would you were all enemies, and had freedome to fight in the Road: to which I replied, that if the <HI>Spanyards</HI> were all man'd with English men, and I had the command of them, we would beat them out of the Sea; unto which he replied you do mis∣take me, I do mean that I would that your Fleet were away, and so many <HI>Spanyards</HI> in your place, mane'd with their own Nation, and then he would not fear to buckle with them all.</P>
<P>After this I had order to take up all the small <HI>English</HI> ships that had Ordnance in the Road, and to give them or∣der to put our pendants. One half I appointed for the Ad∣mirall and the other half for the Vice-admiralls squadron, the winde towards night at S. S. E. and S. E. by S. and began blow hard, and about 3 a clock in the morning very much winde; so that divers of the <HI>Spanyards</HI> drove and brought all their anchors a head, one of them drove thwart a Genawesses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and put her from her anchors and Cables, who drove a shore right against the <HI>Beacon</HI> that stands amongst the sand∣hills; <NOTE PLACE="marg">19th.</NOTE> but it being a most a quarter ebb before she drove a shore, and being a strong ship the water fell from her so fast that he took no hurt that tyde, and before the flood came a∣gain the winde Westward and proved faire weather; so that the Sea was very smooth, and when she fleeted set sayle having one anchor and Cable brought her from one of the Pilots of <HI>Deal,</HI> and anchored amongst the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> This day there came a packet from the Lord Admirall, with order to our Admirall to stay five vessels, that it seems had taken upon them to carry over all the <HI>Spanyards</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> that were brought in the <HI>English</HI> ships, and the names of the
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>Masters of these Barks, viz. were as followeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thursday 19th.</NOTE> <HI>Richard Gil∣bert, Henry Read, Hugh Lawes,</HI> and <HI>Richard Tattom,</HI> and <HI>Willi∣am Williams;</HI> to which purpose Sir <HI>Iohn Penington</HI> gave me a warrant and command to search diligently amongst the Fleet for these Masters, and vessels, which order I shewed un∣to Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> the which did cause him to rejoyce ex∣ceedingly to see that his Majestie was so just in his carriage between them and the <HI>Spanyards;</HI> and said that by his next he would make it known unto his Masters the States.</P>
<P>All that after-noone and the next morning I searched for these Vessells, and went abord of all the small Vessels in the Road, but could not find any Souldiers abord of any of them, and likewise forwarned all of them in the Kings name that they should not take in any <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers to transport them for <HI>Flanders,</HI> and amongst these Vessels by inquiry, I was certified that <HI>Thomas Gilbert,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Lawes,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">20<SUP>th.</SUP> Friday.</NOTE> were staid at <HI>Gravsend,</HI> and as yet the other three were at <HI>London,</HI> where we conceive they are likewise staid. But this order came somthing to late for the most of the Souldiers were sent away before by <HI>Dover-men, Deall,</HI> and <HI>Ramsgate-men</HI> with other small craft, that tooke them abord in the dark nights and carried them away; the winde this day being at S.S.E. three <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> more came in, and two turned out at the South-sands-head, all the night following not much winde only some puffs: with thunder lightning, and Raine; in the morning we could perceive that divers <HI>Hollanders</HI> more were come in that night, and divers other that we did see without the sand, whereof 12 of them were victualers as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that came in did report and some of them were to be made fire-ships af∣ter that there victualls was disposed off. Some of them got in before night and some could not; <HI>Iohn Whitman</HI> this day came in with a great <HI>Hamborough</HI> ship that he had bought at <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with 22 Pieces of Ordnance, swhich ship I likewise stayed by warrant.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.

But at our first comming abord before we could deliver our message, he circumvented us, and said do you see those fellows, meaning the Captains of those two ships, how they have Birth them∣selves I think the divell is in them for I cannot get them to follow my directions as they should; and thereupon pre∣sently sent to warrants and caused them two remove, <NOTE PLACE="marg">21.

Little wind towards night, in the morning the winde southerly; the rest of the ships that we did see thwart the sand and 10 fire-ships came into the Road; the third <HI>Whelp</HI> likewise came in from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> who said that there was not any ships there that were making ready. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirall sent both his Vice-admiralls abord to Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> to proffer him if he pleased to send men abord of their fire-ships to search them, and pro∣mised that they should not Ride neer unto any of his ship, nor neer unto the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>This day came in two <HI>English</HI> ships of 14 Pieces of Ordnance each ship, the one was the <HI>Blessing</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> the other the <HI>Iames</HI> of <HI>Yarmouth</HI> both bound for <HI>Farrow</HI> in <HI>Portugall,</HI> which ships were likewise staid by Sir <HI>Iohns</HI> order; <NOTE PLACE="marg">21.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spanard.</HI> Masts.</NOTE> if they would give him leave, and to further their businesse he would send men abord of their ships to set their masts for them, and present∣ly gave order to one of the Captains of his Frigats to repaire with all speed to <HI>Dover</HI> Road, commanding him with his men and boate to give them the best assistance that they could to get their masts out of the <HI>Peere</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> and to bring them into the <HI>Downes:</HI> which answer was sent to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admirall. Little wind, our Admirall gave order to all the <HI>English</HI> to get up their Top-masts, and Yards, and that all things should be in a readinesse in every ship if any aoccasion should present it self. In the morning the wind t N. by W. the second <HI>Whelp</HI> conveyed. 4 Barks for <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> which Barks I searched for Souldiers, &amp; afterwards prof∣fered Admirall <HI>Trump</HI> that he might search them by some of his Captains for the which he shewed himself very thankfull, but answered that he would trust my report for a greater matter then that; at this time all the <HI>Cannary</HI> men and other <HI>English</HI> ships of small force that were staid, were released by Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> who set sayle to follow their intended voyages; also Mr. <HI>Iames Flawes</HI> that came from <HI>Zant</HI> in the <HI>Dorsset,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">23.

<PB N="22" REF="17"/>out of the Road, and the third <HI>Whelp</HI> was sent to <HI>Chatham;</HI> this day the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admirall sent word to our Admirall, that he did hope to set sayle to morrow with those ships that were ready, if Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> would give him leave, whose answer was, that he was so farre from hindring of him that he would further him the most he could; but it was but a bravade, for he never intended it.</P>
<P>The next morning more Dutch-men of Warre came in∣to the Road, I was sent abord to Admirall <HI>Trump,</HI> to will him to give order for the removing of four of his ships that were anchord on sea-bord of us, the which he gave present order for and they were removed.

This night, the Second Whelp was to convoy two Barks to <HI>Dover,</HI> and with them two others from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> sent me abord of these two Barks, to search for Sol∣diers, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><SUP>th</SUP>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riday.</NOTE>and also to remember his love unto Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and proffer him if he pleased, to send some likewise of his Fleet with me to search them, for the which he returned hearty thanks unto Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> and did at first deny it, but at that time there being in Councell with him most of the Captains of his Squadron, for their better satisfaction he sent two Cap∣tains along with me, and after our return they certifying, that no Soldiers were abord of them, Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> did most heartily desire me to excuse him to our Admirall for his so doing. In the morning before day the Whelp set saile out of <HI>Dover</HI> Road with her convoy, at which time the same Fri∣got that had towed the Masts from <HI>Dover</HI> the day before, lying at the South-forland, to prevent any passages between <HI>Flanders</HI> and the Spanish Fleet, the Frigot perceiving a <HI>Billander</HI> to be a good birth astern of the <HI>Whelp</HI> bound for <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> intending to cut her off, but the <HI>Billander</HI> cast about, and being chased by the Frigot, was forced to run ashore under the Castle of <HI>Dover,</HI> where the Frigot ran ashore closse by her amongst the Rocks, and the water falling, was drie aground, but being fair wether she got off againe, but tooke the <HI>Billander,</HI> upon which a Merchant of <HI>Dover</HI> came abord unto Sir <HI>Iohn Pe∣nington</HI> for reliefe, for the which busines he sent Capt. <HI>Strad∣ling,</HI> Capt. <HI>Feelding</HI> and the Merchant, and my self, abord of Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> but we found him not in his owne ship, for at that time he was at a Councell held aboard of his Vice-Admirall <HI>Dewhite,</HI> unto whom we related our message, unto which he made answer that he did think that the Captaine and the men that were in that Frigot, were drunke with the
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Sack that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> gave him the day before, for he had no Commission for what he had done, and vowed that he would punish him for it, if he did not give him the better answer, and gave order that the <HI>Billander</HI> should pre∣sently be delivered; and said, that he would send warrants to all his Fleet to command them that they should not medle with any Vessels within shot of any of his Majesties Forts, and Ca∣stles, upon no occasion whatsoever, and for the present gave this Comand unto all the Captains that were then abord with him, which were the greatest part of of his Fleet. <NOTE PLACE="marg">28<SUP>th</SUP>. Saterday.</NOTE>After which by some discourse that we had with him, we did ga∣ther, that they had an intent to doe somthing suddenly upon the Spaniards; upon which information, our Admirall pre∣sently writ to Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> commanding him not to at∣tempt any thing upon his Enemy in the Road, for if he did, he should find him his mortall Enemy, and that he would make such a Breach between his Majesty and the States that would not be easily reconcil'd, to which he answered, that he had no Order to doe any thing here in the Road, neither was he yet resolved, to attempt any thing, but when he did he would give our Admirall notice thereof, the which answer we return'd. But our Admirall fearing the worst, and the better to pre∣pare the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> sent Captaine <HI>Robert Slingsby</HI> unto <HI>Don Anthony</HI> the Spanish Admirall, for to certifie him, that he doubted that his Enemies would assault him suddainly, &amp; wish∣ed him to be ready to defend themselves; and also to assure him, that upon any attempt we should take against the Assailant, the which message did much incourage the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who said he would give present order for his Fleet to birth themselves, for the best advantage to succour one another; and returned most humble Thanks unto our Admirall.</P>
<P>In the morning there came a packet from the Lord Admi∣rall, advising that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>French Embassadors</HI> had ingaged themselves unto his Majesty, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>should not attempt any thing upon their Enemies in this Road, so that Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> might discharge all the Merchants ships that were stayed by him, and also he writ that now he did not intend to come downe himself with that Fleet that was making ready, yet they should be hastened downe with all expedition, Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> sent me abord of Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> to certifie him, what their Embassadors had promised, he answer∣ed, that he would not break their promise, neither had he ever such an intent, except his Masters should give him expresse order for it, which answer I returned, and found aboard of our Admirall the Earl of <HI>Arundell</HI> and his Sons, the wind be∣ing Northerly and the first of flood. Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> heaved out his fore-top Saile, and so did divers of his Fleet, and we did the like, and rode apike with our Anchor, being very doubtfull that the Hollanders would set Saile, and fall on presently up∣on the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Lord <HI>Marshall</HI> hearing, that we doubt∣ed, the fight might presently begin, he would not stay dinner with Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> albeit he did most solemnely invite him, But went presently abord of Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> where he had an ex∣cellent good pickle <HI>Herring</HI> for his Break-fast, and from thence he went ashore, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> weyed only to see their Anchors, and let them fall againe. Our Admirall was very unwilling, for all that Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> had promised, as yet to cleare away the Merchants ships, untill farther confe∣rence with Admirall <HI>Tromp,</HI> and to that purpose after dinner he sent his Vice-Admirall Sir <HI>Henry Manering,</HI> and Captain <HI>Stradling,</HI> Captain <HI>Feelding,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Popham</HI> abord of him, unto whom he promised as much as formerly he had done to me, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nday. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><SUP>th</SUP>. </NOTE>with some addition; which was, that he would give our Admirall notice before he would begin with them, and then he hoped that he would doe his best, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A misconstru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of Admiral <HI>Tromps</HI> words.</NOTE> with this Answer they returned to our Admiral, and construed Admirall <HI>Tromps</HI> words of saying, that he hoped they would doe their best, as it were a way of challenge, that we should doe our best and our
<PB N="28" REF="20"/>worst against them. Upon which Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> resolved not to clear the Merchants ships, but sent a packet thereof presently to the Lord Admiral, and gave me order to wey our Anchor in the morning, and to get farther off, and to ride without all the Fleet, the wind being all Easterly, the which command was performed betimes in the morning, after which our Ad∣mirall sent Captaine <HI>Slingsby</HI> abord of the Spanish Admiral, to assure him, that he did not remove his Fleet farther off the shore, to leave an open gap for the Hollander to come in up∣on him, but to be the more readyer to assist him upon all oc∣casions, for the which he returned most hearty thanks, but withall did complaine of a <HI>Hollands</HI> Frigot, that was amongst their Fleet yesterday towards night, and they fearing her to be a Fier-ship shot a <HI>Musket</HI> at her, and demanded whether they would lay him abord or no, to which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> replyed, that he would be abord of him in the morning. Upon which Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> sent me abord of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to inquire wherefore he should threaten to be abord the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the morning.</P>
<P>I was no sooner come into the <HI>Cabbin,</HI> to <HI>Admiral Tromp,</HI> but he began to complaine of that very busines, saying, that heand his Vice-Admiral, and some other of his Captains, before Sun-setting.</P>
<P>The last night, went in one of his Frigots to view the strength of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, and as they past amongst them, one ship shot a <HI>Musket</HI> shot through the Frigots <HI>Misson,</HI> not far above his Head and his other Captains, upon which saith he, I sent one of my Captains in my <HI>Shallop</HI> abord of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and at his Ships side, told the Captaine that he had broken the liberty of his Majesty of <HI>Englands</HI> Road, by shoot∣ing at him, and withall threatned that upon that Breach, they would be abord of them in the morning, but said he, I did it but to scare them, for he never had any such intent, for he would not as he had divers times promised, attempt any thing upon them, without givingour <HI>Admirall</HI> notice thereof, and said, then he
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>hoped that he would doe his best for us, to the which, I de∣manded whether that he meant his best and his worst against them, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th.</NOTE> he answered me God forbid that I should say so; for that were a kinde of challenging the King of <HI>England</HI> in his owne Road,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday,</NOTE> I pray you said he mistake not my meaning, for my <HI>English</HI> is not very good, and I speak in our <HI>Dutch</HI> phrase, to doe the best for us, my meaning was that you would shoote over us, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Admirall <HI>Tromp</HI> cleareth himself of a miscoustructi∣on of a word that he speak.</NOTE> and to hit us; to which I replyed, that his meaning was otherwise interpreted yesterday, by our Vice-admirall, for they understood it as a challenge, that we should doe our best and our worst, and as I thought our. Admirall had sent up a packet of it unto his Majesty, or the Lord Admiral, upon which he did vow and protest that he did never mean any such thing, and the <HI>Dutch Audient</HI> of <HI>Callis,</HI> that was abord with him, did averre the same; with which Message I return∣ed, but <HI>Admirall Tromp</HI> was very much perplexed at it, and desired the <HI>Audient</HI> above said, and some other Gentlemen and Captains that he had abord with him, for to come abord unto our Admiral, to clear that aspersion which was laid upon him, the which they performed, and gave Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> very good satisfaction therein, and did according to their request send up an other packet to cleare this mistake, or misconstruction of his words. After noone the Lord of <HI>Suffolk</HI> being Lord <HI>War∣den</HI> of the sinck Ports, came to our ships side, and afterwards Rowed round about all the Fleet, and returned to <HI>Dover,</HI> the <HI>Winde</HI> still continuing Easterly, by which meanes those Ships that we expected from <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Chatham</HI> could not come unto us.</P>

<PB N="30" REF="21"/>that the fault was their owne, for to Ride with such a small Vessell so far from their Fleet; for an Adviser as he conceived should ride closse by the Admiral; and likewise said that he could not look after every one of their Vessels, yet thus much he would doe for them, if they could heare that she were put into any Harbour in <HI>England</HI> he would be a meanes that she should be stayed, and kept for them.</P>

<P>When the Tyde of flood came, likewise all the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that were to the Southwards of us, set faile and stood off and tack't, and most part of them Anchored to the Northwards of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> only some few Birtht themselves a Seabord off us, which caused us to doubt that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would sud∣dainly fall on upon their Enemies, of which Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> gave the <HI>Spaniards</HI> notice by Captain <HI>Slingsby;</HI> likewise I was sent a∣bord of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> to give him to understand, that in his packet that he had received this morning, his Majesty was pleased to mention, that within few dayes he would give or∣der to warne them all both Spaniards and Dutch out of his Road; to which he replyed, I would it were to morrow, after∣wards I demanded of him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Doubtfull that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had received order to fight with them in the Rord.</NOTE> whether he had received any farther order by his last Adviser that came from <HI>Holland,</HI> he answer∣ed, that he could not tell whether he had received any order or not, but he had received some Letters from his Masters, the which he had sent up to <HI>London</HI> to their Embassador, from whence he did expect an Answer very suddainly; but withall
<PB N="32" REF="22" MS="y"/>said that he would live and dye by his word, or that hee would not attempt any thing upon the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> before hee made Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> acquainted with his intentions, and pro∣mised that his ships without us should remove.</P>
<P>After-noone, <NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Sloops from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with Men and Provision.</NOTE> there came into the <HI>Downes</HI> twenty Saile of <HI>Dunkirk Sloops,</HI> laden with men, and Provision for the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> called a Councell of all his Captains and Masters, to advise whether it were not fitting for us to wey with our Fleet, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wednesday</NOTE> and to birth our selves to windwards of those <HI>Hollanders</HI> that did ride without us, to the w<SUP>ch</SUP> we all agreed, if so be that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not remove according to promise, at which meeting, our Admirall did encourage all his Capt. and Mrs. to shew themselves men, in the ayding of that party that should be assaulted, in his Majesties Chamber, as this Road is called, the which they all promised faithfully to performe, and so de∣parted every one to his owne Ship, it being likely to blow hard, the wind towards night at E. and by N.</P>
<P>At day light the wind being at E. S.E. our Admirall sent me abord of Vice-admirall <HI>White,</HI> who commanded those Ships that rode to windward off us, and which as wee did finde afterwards, were appointed to attend upon us, when their Admirall should fall on upon the <HI>Spanyards;</HI> when I came abord of him, I demanded of him, why he did not remove with his ships, and said unto him, that our Admiral had sent me unto him to know whether he did intend to beleaguer him in his Majesties Road; he answered no, he had no such intent, but would remove with his Squadron where I should direct him. I willed him to go to the Northward or to the Southward of us, or to the Leewards of us, and not to ride in the wind of us, the w<SUP>ch</SUP> he promised should presently be performed; and put out his Blood Colours upon the <HI>Poope,</HI> which was a signe for the other ships to wey their Anchors, and they removed pre∣sently; but after my message was delivered, the Vice-admirall
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>who calleth me Cousen, demanded wherefore the <HI>Spanyards</HI> did still delay their time of going forth of the road; I answer'd him that in the first place the wind was contrary. Secondly, they had sent to <HI>London</HI> for Powder and other provision, and until that came they could not stirre, also I demanded of him whe∣ther they had any farther directions then they had formerly, he answered me that he knew not what the Admirall had, and seeing that I could not learne any thing from him, I tooke leave, and when I came abord related his Answer to our Admirall, all his Ships weyed, and new birtht themselves, and some of them Anchored right to windwards of us, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thursday</HI> 3</NOTE> upon which we weyed with all our ships, and Anchored to the Southwards of them all.</P>
<P>After this the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had two severall Councels, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holland∣ers did profer to give Spaniards, 5 C.

<P>The Spanish Admirall sent unto our Admirall, to desire him to come and ride by him to secure his Fleet, or that he would let him come with his Fleet by him; to the which Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> answered, that if so be that their Admirall would come with his Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and ride where he did, he would goe with his Fleet, and ride where he did ride, for that was the best part of all the road, the which Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> had left unto him as formerly for the better security of his Fleet; but to ingage himselfe to ride between the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and them, and thereby to bring himselfe into danger of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Fire-ships, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>October</HI> 25.</NOTE> he would not, but said to him that he might assure his Admirall, that if so be that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did attempt any thing upon them in the road, he would with that strength that he had, give him his best assistance, also he told him that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had been with him, and proffered to give them 500. barrells of Powder; and likewise hee sent him word, that if he would have taken his former advise, he might have gone away with lesse danger, before so many <HI>Hollanders</HI> came, and not to have stayed for that Powder.</P>

<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that came through the <HI>Guls</HI> from the North∣wards, perceiving us at Anchor neare the Southermost of the <HI>Spanyards</HI> that were a-shore, kept off without shot of us, and followed their Admirall, the wind being at N.N.W. a stiffe gale.

And if so be that hee should by force take them from us as very well he might, ha∣ving five times our strength, it would bee a greater affront un∣to his Majesty, and disgrace unto us. Also he said, that here∣after their force would decrease and ours might increase, and then we might happen to seaze upon some better purchase, or more and better ships and men, therby to give his Majesty bet∣ter satisfaction, if he required it; upon a small debate hereof, we all concluded, to cleare them away, for the which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captaines did very much rejoyce; then it was likewise con∣cluded, that Capt. <HI>Iohn Hall,</HI> Captaine of the <HI>Dread-naught,</HI> should goe up to his Majesty with a true Relation, of what had past that day sevenight, by our Admirall and all the Cap∣taines and Masters of the fleet. At this time he was set ashore being 7 a clocke at night, at which time wee did see a great flash like Lightning over the Foreland, which was the <HI>Portu∣gals</HI> Admirals powder that blew up, when the fire came to it.</P>
<P>At high-water some of the Ships got of from the shore, af∣ter midnight the wind came to the West, and W. and by N. and blew hard. So that the next Tyde all the ships that were tight drove off the shore, whereof their was eight <HI>Lubickers</HI> and <HI>Hambourgers.</HI></P>

The men wee found all of them packing up to goe a-shore, we demanded the reason why they left their Ship; they answered, that they were wearied with Pomping, and said their hold was full of water. But wee an∣swered them that there could not bee much water in her; for the ship was a-float and did Swim as jocant now as shee did when she was in the Raod, also I lookt downe into the hold and could perceive the flowre dry, upon which we perswaded them to continue abord, and not so basely to loose a ship of that worth and consequence, and Inquiring for the chiefe Of∣ficers belonging to the said ship, found that they were all gone a-shore to <HI>Don Andrews de Castro</HI> their Vice-admirall, to take Instructions from him what they should doe with their Ship, this relation or answer, we had from the Master and the Pilot of Captaine <HI>Whellers</HI> ship.

Marchant men prepared at <HI>London</HI> for his Majesties service, came into the Road, who reported that the rest of their Fleet would be downe soone after them. The next morning before noone, a Spanish Commander came with a Letter from the Lord Warden, to desire our Admirall to send some Ships in∣to <HI>Dover</HI> Road, to secure one of the Spanish Galeons that had bin run a-shore between <HI>Dover</HI> Castle and the Peere neare un∣to <HI>Dover.</HI> Iust at that instant we described the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fleet comming about the South foreland, but the Admirall had no
<PB N="49" REF="30"/>Colours abroad, they came all unto Anchor right thwart of <HI>Kings-downe,</HI> the Admirall came headmost and saluted us, and so did all his Fleet one after another. But we did not answer him one Piece of Ordnance; when we deseryed them, a Coun∣cell was called, and Order given that all our Ships should be presently made ready to set sayle. Also it was Ordered, that Captain <HI>Rich. Fielding,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> and my selfe, should goe to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollands</HI> Admirall, to inquire what his Intention was, that hee did returne againe into his Majesties Road, unto whom he had given so high an affront. But the wind blowing so hard and the tyde against us, wee could not get abord of him that night.</P>
<P>At day light the wind not so boysterous but continuing still westerly, wee got abord of them, and demanded of Ad∣mirall <HI>Tromp</HI> his intention as abovesaid, who answered that hee had no other Intent for his comming in there, but to Repaire some defects: that his Fleet had sustained in the fight with the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> as to fish some of their Masts and yards that were shot, and also to stop some shot-holes between wind and water. Then we demanded of him, what hurt he had sustained in the fight, and what damage he had done to his Enemies. He answered, praised be God, he had received no great damage amongst his Fleet, and that hee had taken 9. or 10. Sayle of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galeons and hoped of more taken by some ships of his, and had fired the <HI>Portugals</HI> Admirall as is formerly mentioned, and how that <HI>Don Lopus de Ossa</HI> the Commander of that ship, and his Company did shew themselves brave Sol∣diers, for her lower Ordnance continued playing vpon them when the fire was at their Top-masts head; also he said that they saved of the <HI>Spanyards</HI> that lept overbord nere 70 men, who did certify him, that <HI>Don Lopus,</HI> albeit he was a man of above 70 years of age, and had his arme shot of in the begin∣ing of the fight, yet hee continued above vpon the upper deek, Incouraging of his men to fight it out unto the last, vntill
<PB N="50" REF="31"/>the fire seazed vpon him, whose death he did much lament. Al∣so he said, that the prime Admirall <HI>Don Anthony do Oquendo,</HI> never Cut his Mainsayle nor let fall his Sprit sayle, but conti∣nued by his consort <HI>Don Lopus</HI> so long as he could succor him, but when he see him fired, and past hopes of Reliefe, he made all the Saile that he could and with the Admirall of <HI>Donkerke</HI> &amp; divers other ships of his fleet, he ran away to the westwards.</P>
<P>Before midnight the wind Westered so, that so farre as they were a head of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> so much they were to windwards of them; yet the <HI>Hollanders</HI> plyed too and fro all the night, expecting, that on the morrow, by shift of wind, they might recover them.</P>
<P>But in the Morning not one of them were in sight so that he thought that they had got <HI>Donkirk.</HI> But said hee, I hope ere long to Burne both him and all his Fleet, as they ride in the Road under the Splinter. A∣mongst other discourse with him, I did Inquire for my Friend Cap∣taine <HI>Forran</HI> a French Captaine formerly mentioned, and how he had behaved himselfe in the fight, he answered me, that he was a stout man of Warre, and said that if so be that all his Captains had bin such as he was, they might have done more then they did.</P>
<P>But hee imployed him about a businesse of Consequence, otherwayes he had been in the Road. Which was as J was afterward informed, to take the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galeon that rode in <HI>Dover</HI> Road. The which Ser∣vice he performed; for the next day there came Complaints unto our Admirall, that she was taken out of the Road in the night and carried away, which was impossible for us to prevent; For the <HI>Hollands</HI> Fleet did ride in the mid-way betweene the <HI>Spanyard</HI> and our Fleet.</P>
<P>After which hee demanded of vs, what was the state of all the <HI>Span∣yards</HI> that were run ashore vpon the strand, we answered that the grea∣test part of them were Sunke and splitt, so that they would come to the Country People according as he had destined them at his first Coming hither, and that the <HI>hamborgers</HI> and <HI>Lubikers</HI> had possession of ther ships discharged their Souldiers and for the rest they were sould, and possest by English men, which was Related by his Order before all his Cap∣tains that were abord with him which were at least 20 or 30 of them vpon which bee said that hee was glad that the English had so much Benefit by them, and also, that thereby hee was free from being In∣gaged, to fetch them from the shore, and from amongst our fleet, as some of his other Captaines had made a motion to have him doe; for saith he I might thereby have given his Majestie, and the whole Fleet
<PB N="51" REF="31"/>of England more distast, then with all that he had formerly done, the which he would be very loath to doe, But if so be that the English had not had possession of them, By the Instigation of the rest of his Fleet, he must have bin forced to put it to a hazard.</P>
<P>To which we answered, that our strength was now increast, and we did expect more before many houres; so that hee would find it a worse bought then all, which proved accordingly; for before Night there came into the <HI>Downes</HI> foure of his Majesties Ships of the second Rank and one of the third Ranke, and Six of the best <HI>straights</HI> Merchants Ships that were in the River of <HI>Thames.</HI> The wind after-noone at N. N.W. After our comming abord to Sir <HI>John,</HI> and relating what we had heard and sayd, hee sent Captain <HI>Slinsby</HI> and my selfe ashore unto the Spanish Vice-Admirall <HI>Don Andrewes de Castro,</HI> To certifie him of all what wee had heard from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and how that wee had Informed them that all his Ships that were a-sloat, were in the pos∣fession of the <HI>English.</HI> By which meanes, wee had diverted them from their Resolutions, which was, to have come and taken them all away with them, which would have cost him a Bloody nose, at least. Also we certified him, that our Admirall was sorry to heare of the base Ca∣riage of the Country people towards him and his Men, the which was come to his Majesties knowledge; for the Earle of <HI>Northumberland</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Intimated so much in a Packet to our Admirall, and that his Ma∣jesty would have him to take care that they should not suffer any wrong by any of his Subjects. The which our Admirall would endea∣vour to performe, so farre forth as his Power would reach, which was no further then the Road, but hee had no Command upon the Land, also J gave him notice that J had Order from our Admirall, to goe abord of his Ship and the rest of the Wacks upon the shore, to looke after them; that no man should Imbezell any thing from them, and to forbid all men whatsoever, except it were such as were hyred to by his Substitutes, upon peyne of his Majesties displeasure, not to take any thing out of those <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships a-ground; for the which and all former, hee returned most hearty thankes to our Admirall.</P>
<P>In the Morning the wind was at N. by W. a staffe gale, before day a Packet came from the Lord Admirall, and by a order therein I was Sent a shore to the Spanish Vice-admirall to give him to understand, that our Admirall had Order to Convoy his Souldiers for <HI>Flanders,</HI> if he did ship them in <HI>English</HI> Bottoms, he Answered that hee did expect some Vessels from <HI>Donkerk</HI> for to transport them; But if they came not
<PB N="52" REF="32"/>he did intend to provide vessels at <HI>Dover,</HI> and then he would thankfully Imbrace our Admiralls Convoy. About noone all the <HI>Hollands</HI> fleet set Sayle and run to the Westwards about the Foreland, and then <HI>Don Andrewes</HI> gave Order to all his ships that were a-float and rid neare the shore to goe Ride farther of. At night the wind Westward and pro∣ved very fayre wether all night, and all the next day afternoone all the <HI>Hollands</HI> fleet came Open of the Forland abord, and bore about on the backside of the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and stood away most of them towards the East of <HI>Holland</HI> and the rest towards <HI>Flanders.</HI> At night Captaine <HI>Hall</HI> Re∣turned from his Majestie, who had certified his Majestie of all the pro∣ceedigns which had hapned betwixt the <HI>Spanyards</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Next morning came a Complaint unto our Admirall that divers of the Boats of his Fleet had bin abord of the wracks, and had Imbezelled and taken out their Provisions; upon which our Admirall gave Order to Capt. <HI>Hall,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stradling,</HI> Capt. <HI>Ramsby,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> and my selfe, &amp;c. To goe abord of all the Fleet, and to search them, having with us two Spanish Captaines likewise to accompany us. In our search wee found more or lesse abord of every Ship, some of the Span∣yards provisions, the which was carried by the sayd Ships-boats abord of the St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> and the <HI>Crowne,</HI> two of the Spanish ships. But for the Anchors and Cables that wee had taken up, that they Cut away in the Road, those wee detayned abord untill farther Order from the Lord Admirall. But wee would not suffer the <HI>Deal</HI> Pilots to meddle with any one of the Anchors. At Night there came a Packet from the Lord Admirall, that wee should not suffer any one to meddle with an Anchor or Wrack, if they were so neare the shore, as that a Horseman riding into the Sea at low water could reach it with his Launce or Speare, and that wee should not meddle with any thing within that li∣mit; for that Priviledge did belong to the Lord Warden, or to the Lords of the Manner. Likewise there came another Packet, for the Ships that were lately sent downe, to returne to <HI>Chatham,</HI> and the Ships which were sent from <HI>London</HI> to returne to <HI>London;</HI> onely the Winter guard, so there was none left but the Winter guard.</P>
<P>The next day, Captaine <HI>Slingsby</HI> carried over the Spanish Master <HI>Delda Campo;</HI> And the same day, there came over Eight <HI>Dunkirke</HI> Sloopes, who carried away foure hundred Souldiers, that set sayle in the after-noone.</P>
<P>The next day, all the Ships had their Warrants to take the first op∣portunity of wind and wether to returne from whence they came.</P>
