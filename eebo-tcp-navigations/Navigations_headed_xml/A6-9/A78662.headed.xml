<P>WHereas it doth appeare to the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That the King, seduced by wicked Counsell, doth intend to leavy Warre against his Parliament; and whereas information hath beene given; That the Iewels of the Crowne (which by the law of the land ought not to be alienated) are either pawned or sold in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> or some other parts beyond the Seas, and thereby great Sums of money provided to be returned to <HI>York,</HI> or to some of his Majesties Servants or Agents for His Majesties use: And whereas tis more then probable, That this great Provision of Monyes in such an extraordinary way, is to maintaine this intended warre, and there∣by to bring the whole Kingdome into utter ruine and combustion. It is therefore declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament. That who∣soever hath beene, or shall be an Actor in the selling or pawning of any of the Iewels of the Crowne, or hath, or shall pay, lend, send, or bring any Money in <HI>Specie</HI> into this Kingdome, for, or upon any of those Iewels; Or whosoever hath or shall accept of any Bill from beyond the Seas, for the payment of any summe of money for, or upon any of those Iewels, and shall passe any summe according to such Bill, after notice of this Order, with∣out acquainting this House with the receipt of such Bill before he accept the same; Or if he have already accepted any such Bill, then with the ac∣ceptance thereof before the payment of the mony, Every such person shall be held and accounted a promoter of this intended warre, an enemy to the State, and ought to give satisfaction for this publick dammage out of His owne Estate.</P>
