<HEAD>THE Trecherous Plot of Confederacie in <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Rebels have done much harme in the Country of <HI>Calway,</HI> in the province of <HI>Conog</HI> where they spare no cruelty to any Sex, estate or degree whatsoever, and that even upon the Lords day: on which day if they are not shedding of bloud, they have meetings of playes, gaming, pastimes, bag∣pipes, drinking, and abominable venery, and wanton∣nesse in every place where they come.</P>
<P>Vpon St. <HI>Andrewes</HI> day last, being the 30 of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1641. there pitched about the number of 300 Rebels in armes neare <HI>Logreags,</HI> and <HI>Artaure,</HI> who marched with Spanish Cullors, and Armes in their Antient, and 100 more pitched neare <HI>Temenage,</HI> who hovered up and downe about the woods and villages therea∣bouts, seeking an opportunity to worke their wicked designes.</P>
<P>Their intent was (as it was conceived) to march to <HI>Ʋort Omnie</HI> to surprize the Earle of <HI>Clanrickards</HI> house, and to take away, and overthrow his forces; which consist of an hundred horse, and as many foot, which is the best strength thereabouts: but it seems that their intent was as well to surprize the Castle of <HI>Logrags,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Callway</HI> also, as well as the forces of the said Earle, but they were preverted at that time.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>The said Castle of <HI>Logerage,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Calway</HI> were in great danger to have beene betrayed into the hands of the Rebels, by some popish souldiers, with certaine popishly affected Gentlemen and Marchants that were inhabitants there.</P>
<P>They conspired a plot with the <HI>Rebels,</HI> in which plot they intended a bloudy design in cruell manner, against the Castle, Fort, and townes thereabout, wher∣in had they accomplished their designes, they would, as it is justly feared, bin as cruell to the Protestants there, as they are in other places thereabouts.</P>
<P>To contrive this Plot covertly and suttlely not to be taken notice of, they had contrived a way to streng∣then themselves with Ammunition from <HI>France,</HI> for there were there enhabiting certain Marchants, whose ships were come from thence laden with salt: The comming of which ships, as it doth appeare, were an <HI>Item</HI> to the <HI>Rebels,</HI> to give them notice of the time, which caused them then to march into those parts, as it is conceived. These ships being laden with salt, were presently gone about to be unladed, to which Office, were picked out by the Marchants, such who they thought fittest for that secrecie: yet were there discerned by the Officers, to bee brought from the ships, muskets and swords: which being discovered to the Protestans there, the matter was further sought into, and it was found, that there were brought over from <HI>France,</HI> buryed in the salt, beside the said mus∣kets and swords, divers other Ammunition for war; brought over, as is conceived, for to strengthen the <HI>Rebels</HI> against the <HI>Protestants,</HI> or at least the Papists thereabout to assist them in the betraying up of those
<PB REF="3"/>
places into their hands by the said forces, by which meanes, both the Fort and Castle, and all places thereabouts were in great danger.</P>
<P>About this time, the ships being well nigh unla-which was about St. <HI>Andrews</HI> day, as before, the rebels marched about these places, where they began to in∣sult and fall upon the people, putting many to the sword, so the Protestants at <HI>Callway,</HI> &amp; therabouts, sea∣zed on the Ammunition, and strengthned themselvs: whereby they fell upon the <HI>Rebels,</HI> and there was a great battell fought between them, which wrought a great feare to all people thereabouts: but there came in good ayd to the Protestant side; so that in that fight they received not much hurt, onely somewoun∣ded. But of the Irish rebels there were taken twenty, which were sent to the States to be censured, and a∣bove an hundred slaine, and wounded so sore, that they are not likely to live, and the rest returned backe againe, and fled for their lives to another part of the running Campe.</P>
<P>The next day they returned againe with a greater Force, but marched two or three miles from <HI>Logrags</HI> on the other side toward the Earle of <HI>Clanrickards</HI> againe, against whom they have long conspired, and they marched so furiously in the night, that they were come to the said Earle of <HI>Clan∣rickards</HI> before they were taken notice of, or their returne known: so that in the morning ere they were aware, the houfe was beset with the Rebels, who began to pull downe the walls, and discharged against the house, which they could not come neare, because the wall is so large about the house, so the forces of the Earle prepared themselves, &amp; came forth against them; but the Rebels being too strong for them, slew about 30 of their company in a short space, and discomfitted the Lord and his company exceedingly, so that they were all in great feare.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>But it pleased God to send them up reliefe from the town, &amp; some other <HI>Protestants</HI> that came in from other places thereabouts to relieve them, whereby the Rebels were so beset on a sudden, that they were faine to flye, and take the woods.</P>

<P>The Earle of <HI>Torent</HI> is in great danger to be sur∣prized; for there is great wait laid for him by an Army of Rebels, that came out of the Country of <HI>Corke,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Lymbicke</HI>: but wee hope that they will not be able to prevaile against him: for he is strongly fortified with 100 horse, and 300 foot, who are provided for that place where he is, who guard the Castle, and are appointed for the defence of the Towne.</P>

<P><PB REF="4"/>The other part of the <HI>Rebels</HI> doe march towards <HI>Kingsale</HI> Castle, and the New-fort, which may prove of the most dangerus consequence of all, in case they should once be setled there; for from thence they can soone have wealth, ammunition, and reliefe from <HI>Spaine,</HI> which is much suspected, and feared, for that is the chiefe Castle of all the Westerne parts of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> for strength, and conveniency, and lyeth upon the Sea-coast, where reliefe may come in from <HI>Spain</HI> with little trouble, which God prevent them of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rebels</HI> tooke Sir Thomas Sevell, and hanged him upon a tree in his own grounds, and cut his flesh in pieces, carrying pieces thereof up and downe in their hands, saying, this is the flesh of one of the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lers</HI> against our holy Father the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>These, and such like, are the miseries of that King∣dome of <HI>Ireland</HI> at this time: God in his mercy send them comfort.</P>
