<P>HAving about a Month since, Printed a small Relation in Three Sheets of Paper concerning the <HI>Turks</HI> late Pro∣ceedings in <HI>Hungary, Transylvania, &amp;c.</HI> with good Acceptance: I thought I could not better Gratify their Curiosity, that took the Peyns to read the Former, then by Seconding That Introduction, with This <HI>Continuation</HI> of the Story: being Turned out of <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the Work of the Same Originall <HI>Author,</HI> beginning with This where the Other brake off.</P>

<HEAD>A Continuation of the <HI>TURKS</HI> Proceedings, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N all This Action the <HI>Grand Vi∣zier</HI> has playd both the <HI>Fox,</HI> and the <HI>Lion,</HI> mingling <HI>Fair words,</HI> and <HI>Threatnings;</HI> and Publishing still before the Blow, such pro∣mises of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Immunity</HI> to such as would range themselves under his pro∣tection, as he well knew most likely to work upon the People, he had to deal with. It is true, that these Overtures of Clemency, from so barbarous an Enemy, were look'd upon
<PB N="24" REF="3"/>by the wiser sort, rather as a trick of <HI>State,</HI> then <HI>Good-faith;</HI> yet with the Generality, This way of proceeding took effect.</P>
<P>The Place most in the <HI>Turks</HI> eye was <HI>Pres∣burg;</HI> being the chief City of the <HI>Nether-Hun∣gary:</HI> (wherein is laid up the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Crown) A Place, considerable both for the <HI>Goodliness</HI> of the Town, and for the <HI>Situation</HI> of it; to which advantage the <HI>Turk</HI> was no Stranger; as ap∣pears by the frequent <HI>Alarms,</HI> he gave to that City, the gaining whereof, would have open∣ed him a way to <HI>Vienna,</HI> on the One side, and to <HI>Raab, Comorra,</HI> and <HI>Newhausel,</HI> on the Other: The <HI>Danube</HI> passing by in Two Branches, to the Island <HI>Schut,</HI> at the end whereof stands the Fort <HI>Comorra;</HI> and <HI>Raab</HI> not far off. Nor was it unknown to <HI>Count Strozzi,</HI> (the Governour of <HI>Presburg</HI>) how much the safety of the <HI>Whole,</HI> Depended upon the Security of This <HI>Part,</HI> which mov'd him to make timely provision, for the Defence thereof. But the neighbouring Places, that lay open, as <HI>St. George, Posing, Mo∣dern,</HI> &amp;c. chose rather to submit, then expose themselves to the extremityes of Fire and Sword, by an unprofitable Opposition. <HI>Neutra</HI> indeed (a Place not far from <HI>Newhausel,</HI> nor less defensible) might have resisted, but did not, and upon the Rendition the Garrison,
<PB N="25" REF="3"/>according to agreement, was conducted to <HI>Presburg. Tyrnaw,</HI> and other Towns yielded also.</P>
<P>The Enemies next Attempt was upon <HI>Schin∣ta,</HI> wherein was lodg'd a fayr Artillery, but the Governour deported himself valiantly, and beat them off. By this time, <HI>October</HI> was half over, and the season, call'd the <HI>Turk</HI> to his <HI>Winter-Quarters:</HI> who finding his time lost up∣on <HI>Schinta,</HI> drew off to <HI>Newhausel;</HI> which place is now repaired, and strongly Garrison'd, the River <HI>Neutra</HI> being brought round about it. From Thence, the <HI>Turk</HI> took his march, with a considerable Body, to the <HI>Ship-Bridge</HI> at <HI>Gran,</HI> and caused some of his great Guns to be pass'd over there, as if his purpose had been to Win∣ter in his own Territories. Those of <HI>New∣bausel</HI> laboured hard to get into the <HI>Schut,</HI> and settle themselves, betwixt the Two Forts of <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Comorra:</HI> whereupon <HI>Montecuculi</HI> and <HI>Serini</HI> joyn'd their Forces to oppose them.</P>
<P>And now the fortune of the Warre seem'd a little to flatter the <HI>Christians; Nicholas Serini</HI> on the 17. of <HI>Oct.</HI> defeating a Party of 300 <HI>Turks,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Peter,</HI> about the same time fal∣ling upon a Body of about 7000 of them near <HI>Carlstadt,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Stiria:</HI> where they designed an Inrode upon the <HI>Christians;</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="4"/>but <HI>Count Serini,</HI> and <HI>Count Aursburg,</HI> from an <HI>Ambuscade,</HI> brake in among them, slew 1000, and took 100 Prisoners; among which were diverse Persons of Note, and the Son of a great <HI>Bassa:</HI> the rest disperst themselves; and the Victorious in this Adventure got great Booty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serinies</HI> have shew'd themselves, in This their deportment, the true Heirs of the Honour, and Valour of that Noble Family; and they put us in mind, of a memorable Action, which was performed by their Grandfather, <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> in the year 1566, <HI>To his Eternall Glory.</HI></P>
<P REND="italic">On the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>August 1566, Solyman</HI> the <HI>Mag∣nificent</HI> layd Siege to the Fort <HI>Sigeth,</HI> wherein this great Captain, <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> was Governour; who made many bold Sallyes upon the Eenemy, took many Prisoners, and at one time caused <HI>300 Turks</HI> to be beheaded; which so far enraged <HI>Solyman,</HI> that he plyed his Batteries, and Attempts, with greater fu∣ry then before. <HI>Serini</HI> perceiving the <HI>New-Town</HI> to be upon the poynt of being entred, caused it to be set on fire, and retreated into the <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P REND="italic">A while after, the <HI>Turks</HI> assaulted the <HI>Old Town,</HI> but were so bravely received, that in One Storm they lost <HI>2000</HI> men. However they attempted it again, and carried it; whereupon, <HI>Serini</HI> was forced to retire into the <HI>Castle,</HI> against which the Enemy planted a
<PB N="27" REF="4"/>Battery, and gave One surious Attaque; but were beaten off with great loss.</P>
<P REND="italic">While This pass'd, <HI>Solyman</HI> died of a Bloody-Flux, <HI>(Sept. 4.)</HI> but <HI>Mahomet Bassa</HI> labouring as much as possible to keep his death conceal'd from the <HI>Turks,</HI> caused the Corps (Embalmed, and Gloriously Clothed) to be expos'd in a dark place to the People, as sitting on his Throne, and the <HI>Bassa</HI> himself, with all his usuall Ceremonyes, and Reverence, feigning some singular matter of privacy, and business with him. At length, the <HI>Bassa</HI> went out of the Tent, wiping his eyes as if he had been crying; which gave the Officers occasion to enquire, why he wept? To whom he re∣plyed, that <HI>It grieved his heart to think how ma∣ny brave Souldiers would be suddenly put to the Sword:</HI> for (sayes he) <HI>Solyman</HI> has made a <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>desperate Oath,</HI> that if this Place be not taken in two dayes, every Colonel that bears any Charge in the Attempt, shall certainly be put to death. Hereupon, the <HI>Janizaryes</HI> fell into a direct Rage, and gave a furious Assault, but were repulsed with ex∣ceeding losse: they had howover set fire to the <HI>Castle,</HI> and now the Noble Defender of it, seeing his fate be∣fore his eyes, call'd the small remainder of his men a∣bout him, and exhorted them to stand by him, and re∣solve to dye with him. Whereupon, he Clothed himself in a <HI>Violet-coloured Velvet Suit,</HI> took the <HI>Key</HI> of the <HI>Castle,</HI> and some Gold in his <HI>Pocket;</HI> caus'd
<PB N="28" REF="5"/>the Gates to be open'd, and the great Guns to be drawn thither, and discharged among the Enemy: and in a Cloud of Smoak, he issued forth with his Men, among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and fought till he was shot in the head. This was the end of the Valiant <HI>Serini.</HI> It was rec∣koned that <HI>20000 Turks</HI> were slain before this Fort. No sooner was <HI>Serini</HI> fain, but the <HI>Infidels</HI> throng∣ing about the Corps, cut off his head, and set it on a Pole for one day, after which, they sent it with a Scoffe to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour. <HI>Now to resume the Story.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Hollach,</HI> being chosen General of the <HI>Imperiall Auxiliaryes,</HI> came to <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> his Forces (amounting to 6 or 7000 men) being Enquarter'd betwixt <HI>That,</HI> and <HI>Crembs;</HI> The Emperours Army, lying at that time near <HI>Presburg,</HI> to recruit, being much weakned by many Inconveniencies. The whole Army, (with the <HI>Hungartans, Croatians,</HI> and <HI>Auxiliaryes,</HI> was computed to be 40000 strong; but the se∣verall heads, of so many Nations, who at this time were almost all in <HI>Vienna,</HI> could not (it seems) agree so well together, as not to need his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Majestie's singular Care, and Cir∣cumspect on to keep them from flying into <HI>Partyes,</HI> and <HI>Passions.</HI> There was an Intent to joyn 7 or 8000 men that were raysed in <HI>Silesia</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="5"/>to This Body; but the <HI>Silesian</HI> Forces would neither march out of their native Country, nor obey any Forreign Command; so that They stayd at home to defend their <HI>Borders,</HI> and espe∣cially, the Passage by <HI>Jablunka.</HI></P>
<P>While the <HI>Christians</HI> were laying their heads, and their Forces together, to put themselves in∣to a Posture, the Enemy brake up with his main Body before <HI>Newhausel,</HI> and about the end of <HI>October,</HI> took his March toward <HI>Gran,</HI> and <HI>Offen.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> also with their Prey marched toward <HI>Tartary,</HI> carrying along with them their chiefest Captives in Coaches, and Wagons, driving their ordinary Prisoners a∣long with Whips, naked; and their hair flying about their eyes, just like so many Beasts. In <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary,</HI> they met with some opposition, at which time many of the Captives were for∣ced out of their hands, and about 2000 of these <HI>Tartars</HI> put to the Sword. Count <HI>Nicholas Se∣rini</HI>'s Designe, was to fall upon them, at their passing over the <HI>Ship-Bridge,</HI> and followed them close, sometime in the <HI>Rear,</HI> other∣wile on the <HI>Flanck,</HI> still observing their mo∣tion till he found his opportunity to attaque them.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="6"/>
<P>Upon the last day of <HI>October,</HI> he set upon the <HI>Rear,</HI> and took from them 5 Wagons full of Captives, that they had gotten in <HI>Moravia;</HI> 200 Oxen, and 40 Wagons with Provision. In this Action, he did not only release the Cap∣tives, but defeated also their Drivers, which were about 600 <HI>Janizaries.</HI> They fought stout∣ly for 2 hours from behind their Wagons, so that Count <HI>Serini</HI> his <HI>Hussars,</HI> were forced to quit their Horses, and fight them on foot: which they did with excellent conduct, and successe, giving Quarter only to Two Per∣sons of Note, whose lives were at their mer∣cy.</P>
<P>Herewith, this <HI>Campagnia</HI> seem'd to be at an end, and Count <HI>Serini,</HI> having in appearance little to do further with the Enemy, let his men march homeward: (wanting Fodder for their Horses) the Enemy in the mean while steering their Course toward <HI>Gran, Offen,</HI> and <HI>Weissenburg,</HI> as to their <HI>Winter-Quarters.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> left a Garrison of 4000 in <HI>Newhausel,</HI> under the Com∣mand of Two <HI>Bassaes;</HI> and 10000 about the Fort, partly to defend the <HI>Place,</HI> and partly to repair the <HI>Fortifications.</HI> In <HI>Neutra,</HI> the Enemy left 1500 men, which Place was plundred be∣fore
<PB N="31" REF="6"/>the Army march'd away. The Earls <HI>Co∣chary,</HI> and <HI>Tekelly,</HI> with a Body of near 15000 men raysed in the <HI>Ʋpper</HI> and <HI>Nether-Hungary,</HI> came In to Count <HI>Serini;</HI> which Conjunction the <HI>Turks</HI> mightily endeavoured to hinder, but could not effect it. These Forces are like∣wise drawn out of the Field, since that time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Auxiliaryes,</HI> That is to say; the <HI>Hessen, Brunswick, Lunenburg, Munster</HI> Forces; and O∣thers from the <HI>Rhyne</HI> (some of which, name∣ly Those from <HI>Hessen Darmstadt</HI> perish'd upon the <HI>Danube</HI>) are put into <HI>Winter-Quarters</HI> on the side of that River; but the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburg Auxiliaryes,</HI> are to lye in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Moravia;</HI> and the <HI>Silesian</HI> Forces to tarry in their own Country: for the Councel of Warre at <HI>Vienna,</HI> did not hold it Advisable, to Quarter all the <HI>Auxiliaryes</HI> near together, for fear of Surfeits upon the Fruits, beside that they would have wanted Fodder for their Horse, and in the foul deep wayes they would have found great trouble to have fetch'd it. Another Consideration was, the Easing of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who were already sufficiently weary of Billeting Souldiers. In Fine; there
<PB REF="7"/>is no great Noyse of Armes, and Action, at present, but how the Enemy may be oppos'd next Spring, is the Consulation, and the Que∣stion; who threatens <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the <HI>Empire,</HI> with no lesse then 3 or 400000 Men at the Next <HI>Campagnia.</HI></P>
<P>It was now Resolv'd by his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Majesty, to go to <HI>Regenspurg</HI> about the end of <HI>November</HI> following; there to Advise about the Reliese of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and indeed of <HI>Christendome:</HI> and his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Majesty did likewise Resolve to send Embassadours to the <HI>Pope, Spain, France,</HI> &amp;c. to Sollicit Succour. From the <HI>Pope, Mo∣nyes</HI> are expected, <HI>France</HI> proffers <HI>Men</HI> (but who dares receive them?) <HI>Swede</HI> is willing to Assist in respect of their Interest in <HI>Germany,</HI> and they have sent already 700 well mounted that came from <HI>Bremen:</HI> so that the Instant Business of the <HI>Empire</HI> seems to be rather <HI>Pre∣paration,</HI> then <HI>Present Defence;</HI> and to look for∣ward toward the Spring: the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> ha∣ving already dispers'd his Letters of Menace, and Defyance to all <HI>Christendome</HI> throughout the <HI>Emperours</HI> Hereditary Countries.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Turks</HI> withdrawing the Grosse of
<PB N="33" REF="7"/>his Army, from about <HI>Newhausel,</HI> over the <HI>Da∣nube,</HI> with a Countenance of Disposing him∣self to his <HI>Winter-Quarter;</HI> Mens minds began to be a little Compos'd and Quiet; till <HI>Abaf∣ti,</HI> the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> Creature in <HI>Transylvania</HI> undertook the <HI>Turks</HI> Aftergame, with those Forces that stay'd behind; labouring his Ut∣most to possesse himself of the <HI>Berg,</HI> or <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> (whence comes the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Gold) and other Frontier Places, and Houses belong∣ing of Right to his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Majesty: which Perfidious Designe the <HI>Christians</HI> Army could not conveniently either prevent, or oppose, being already dispers'd for want of Necessa∣ryes both for Man, and Beast.</P>
<P>This same <HI>Abafti;</HI> pass'd in Common E∣steem, for a Person well-affected to the <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> and as One that wayted only a fayre Opportunity to draw his Sword against the <HI>Turk;</HI> but his Actions have now discover'd him: for perceiving what Reputation, Presents, and other Popular Advantages, have accrued to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and the Chiefe Officers of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, upon the Gayning of <HI>New∣hausel;</HI> he likewise turn'd his Study, and En∣deavours the same way, not doubting by his
<PB N="34" REF="8"/>Interests, and Services, to draw from the <HI>Tur∣kish Emperour</HI> as fayre a Reward; undertaking not only to keep, what was already gotten, but to Enlarge the Conquest by a Confiderable Addition.</P>
<P>It being found neither commodious, nor be∣neficiall to expose the <HI>Turks,</HI> and other <HI>Asiatick,</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Forces, (whose Bodyes have been used to a Temperate warme Ayre) to the cold Winter-Blasts of <HI>Hungary:</HI> (which are sharp, though not long) the Hardship of the <HI>Winter-Warre</HI> was rather committed to the <HI>Mountaineers;</HI> That is; to the <HI>Abaftish Transylvanians, Moldavi∣ans, Wallachians,</HI> &amp;c. whose Part it is, to Main∣teyn the <HI>Turks</HI> Ground at least, if not carry the Victory further; and in Briefe, to hold the <HI>Imperialists</HI> in Play, till the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, may conveniently take the Field again toward the Spring. And least the Town <HI>Neutra</HI> should be left Naked; instead of about 600 <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Janyzaryes,</HI> that were taken out of That Garrison, Others, that could better endure the Ayre of the Place, were put in, and a Gar∣rison of 115 <HI>Janizaryes</HI> into the Castle, (a Sort of People which are of great Credit with the <HI>Turk</HI> in Martiall Affayrs; and in truth, These
<PB N="35" REF="8"/>were the Men that ventur▪d the hardest before <HI>Newhausel.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Janizaryes</HI> are <HI>Christians Children,</HI> which were either taken <HI>Captive,</HI> or given in the way of <HI>Tribute,</HI> by such <HI>Christians</HI> as have done Ho∣mage to the <HI>Turks,</HI> These Children are trayn'd up from their Childhood, in the <HI>Mahumetan Be∣lief,</HI> and Inur'd to <HI>Military</HI> exercises. They are very Numerous and Valiant; and doubtless the best support of the <HI>Turkish Empire.</HI> As their Pow∣er is of great use, and service to the <HI>Ottoman Em∣perour</HI> in some cases, so is it in others not less dan∣gerous, their Revolts and Tumults being seldom Iaid, or quieted without Horrible Rapine, and Effusion of Blood. Misery of Miseryes! that the Children of <HI>Christians</HI> should be thus engaged in so Implacable an Enmity to the Dictates both of <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Nature!</HI></P>
<P>About This Time; Newes was brought that a young Son was born to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> upon which Tydings, such a face was set upon the Busyness, as if it had been a Material Part of their Re∣ligion to welcome this young Idoll into the world with the Sacrifice of more <HI>Christian</HI>-Bloud.</P>
<P><HI>Abafti</HI>'s Ayme, (as we have said before) was to
<PB N="36" REF="9"/>work himself in among the <HI>Mine-Towns.</HI> The two first considerable Blocks in his way were <HI>Lewents,</HI> and <HI>Novigrad,</HI> (beside others of less Importance.) In <HI>Lewents</HI> were good Fighting men, Back'd with a Castle that was well fortify∣ed with Thick walls, and Firm Turrets. In This Place, the Enemy found stout opposition, and Lost many men before it; but at last pressing up∣on it with greater Numbers and no Relief ap∣pearing within distance, they took it upon Ac∣cord. Those that March'd out were in no sort Injured, and Those that stayd behind were dis∣arm'd, and did Homage.</P>
<P>After <HI>Lewents</HI> followed <HI>Novigrad,</HI> that lyes deeper in the <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary;</HI> which al∣though a strong Place, and environ'd with a <HI>Mo∣rasse;</HI> yet after a stout Resistance was forc'd to Render to the Enemy. The Forces in it were con∣ducted to <HI>Waitzen,</HI> where they betook themselves to work for their Living, as the Rest of the Pea∣sants, and are enjoyn'd to be ever in Readyness with their Armes. The Governour of it, by Name, <HI>Pedami,</HI> got leave from <HI>Abafti</HI> to go to his Countrey-House in <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and to dwell there, which soon after he did.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="9"/>
<P>On the <HI>Christians</HI> side, there was no good∣will wanting toward the Relief of any of these Places; but all their Attempts fell short, by reason of many Fatalities, and Accidents Inter∣vening.</P>
<P>These successes encouraged the Enemy to draw nearer to the <HI>Mine-Towns,</HI> and to en∣deavour the making of their <HI>Winter-Quarter</HI> thereabouts, and in <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary.</HI> A Ru∣mour was then dispersed that the <HI>Great Vizier</HI> had Commanded the Magistrates of <HI>Frystadt,</HI> and the Neighbouring Parts, upon pain of death to make a <HI>Ship-bridge</HI> over the <HI>Waegh</HI> with all speed, and to provide Victuals and Fodder to entertain him at his comming back. Thus did new Cares and Troubles come on, in a season, when every man flatter'd himself with some hopes of Respit and Repose.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Serini,</HI> that till now, staid in the Isle of <HI>Schutt.</HI> put himself Instantly into Motion, and now and then, met with some Parties, and took good Booty from them; but alass? This would not serve to set the Ballance even. Upon <HI>November</HI> 12. He took, in a Moorish Place, be∣twixt <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Comorra,</HI> ten Camels and as many Mules, laden with Truneks full of Gold and Silver-plate; together with the Condu∣ctours, who were bound for <HI>Constantinople</HI> with this Booty.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="10"/>
<P>In <HI>Comorra</HI> (where the Officers were at that time under Question, and came off well, about the Surrender of <HI>Newhausel</HI>) there were great Complaints of Scarcity of Provision; the Country being so miserably wasted round a∣bout it. Whereupon, at <HI>Vienna</HI> it was taken into thought, how those out-lying Garrisons might be supplyed, and the Enemy disappoin∣ted of their aime, who knew full well the State of their Necessities. It is certain, that the <HI>Aux∣iliaries</HI> and other Forces that were Quarter'd in <HI>Comorra,</HI> would much rather have kept the field, if all other Circumstances would have permit∣ted it; but those <HI>Auxiliaries,</HI> who by too liberal Feeding on the <HI>Austrian</HI> and <HI>Moravian</HI> Fruits, had contracted diseases, neither could, nor would stir; beside that their General, Count <HI>Hohenlo,</HI> a Prudent, Expert, and Judicious Commander, gave many weighty Reasons a∣gainst it. No sooner had this Lord made an Ac∣quaintance in <HI>Vienna;</HI> but ill Fortune met with him his Chamber being Robb'd of VVritings, Moneys, and Jewels, to the value of betwixt twenty and thirty thousand; <HI>Rix Dollars.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Swedish Auxiliaries</HI> were not yet come up; but by Advice from <HI>Leipsick,</HI> they were then upon their March not far from <HI>Thuringen,</HI> (about the midst of <HI>November</HI>) and 150. horse were likewise to come from <HI>Pomerania,</HI> which Forces became the Ground of great Mistakes,
<PB N="47" REF="10"/>happening to be in Motion just upon that Nick of time, when the <HI>Ersordians</HI> (being then Out∣lawed) were in Expectation of the <HI>Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zish</HI> troups: Upon whom they Issued forth, and in their Return left two Carpenters behinde them, whom they hanged upon a VVaggon, which did much enflame the tumult. but the <HI>Swedish</HI> troups, which had so much troubled the heads of divers People, proved to be a Force of ano∣ther design, and Quality.</P>
<P>The Rumour of the Return of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, (now so late in <HI>November</HI>) Encreased more and more; at which time <HI>Filleck</HI> (Some ten mile from <HI>Cassaw</HI>) was given for lost; So that certain Regiments were immediately sent to make good the other <HI>Mine-Townes,</HI> which the Enemy had particu∣larly in their Eye for a <HI>Winter-Quarter.</HI> Those <HI>Christians</HI> which about this time ranfom'd themselves from the <HI>Turks,</HI> speak much of the Stupendious Preparations, which are now in hand against <HI>Christendome;</HI> Affirming it for a Certainty, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is resolv'd to take the field next Spring with an Army of three hundred thousand Men, which causes great per∣plexities in <HI>Poband, Hungary, Moravia, Silesia,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> but the <HI>Polanders,</HI> being at peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> conceived themselves in some measure secured by virtue of that Agreement; but in the <HI>Tartars, Moldavians,</HI> and <HI>Walachians,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="11"/>they have not much confidence: Especially, when they are upon their Excursions. Many were of opinion, that the <HI>Turks</HI> were forc'd upon an irregular and precipitate retreat for want of Provisions, and that their attempts so late in the year, upon <HI>Moravia,</HI> and the neigh∣bouring <HI>Provinces,</HI> were caused partly by the Inviting plenty of all necessaries, which those Countreys afford; and in part, by the encou∣ragement they received from their Correspon∣dents in those Quarters; beside the scarcity, which their longer continuance, upon the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> would infallibly have produced therea∣bouts, to the great inconvenience of their Armyes next Spring.</P>
<P><HI>Hungary</HI> lay now groaning under the burden of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Power, and longing for aid; the <HI>Infidels</HI> over-spreading it like a dismal Cloud, charged with Hail and Thunder: all mens thoughts, being sollicitous, for deliver∣ance, and in continual expectation where the storme would fall. Many were of opinion that <HI>submission</HI> was the best expedient in this extremity; but betwixt the sence of their <HI>Al∣legiance</HI> sworn to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and the <HI>distrust</HI> they had of the <HI>Turks</HI> Justice to his word, di∣vers held off.</P>
<P>The Enemy (who did nothing rashly, though as is generally supposed, rather acting
<PB N="49" REF="11"/>by <HI>Instigation</HI> then <HI>choice</HI>) counted it most ad∣viseable to draw toward <HI>Cassaw</HI> the head City of <HI>Ʋpper-hungary;</HI> knowing full well that when ever the <HI>Christians</HI> should <HI>Ʋnite,</HI> they would make this place the Seat of Warr, and settle themselves There: VVherefore the <HI>In∣fidels</HI> went roundly to work, removing what∣soever might hinder their Progresse, before a∣ny succour could come up to them, which suc∣cour would however at last signify not much a∣gainst so Potent an Enemy.</P>
<P>About this time, the <HI>Polanders</HI> were a little Frighted with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who though return∣ing homeward with their booty already got∣ten, might yet be tempted by their greediness after more, to break into the <HI>Cracovian, Way∣wood-ship;</HI> and from thence to advance into <HI>Silesia,</HI> according to the old saying, <HI>Si Turca veniet in Germaniam, Ibit per Poloniam.</HI> If the <HI>Turk</HI> comes into <HI>Germany,</HI> he shall passe through <HI>Poland.</HI> These Incarnat and Rapaci∣ous Devils, however kept off yet, and carryed their prey to their <HI>Cavernes</HI> there to divide it. One thing is, that <HI>Cham,</HI> being the head and Sovereign of these <HI>Tarters</HI> which had been in <HI>Moravia,</HI> was a friend to <HI>Poland,</HI> and about this time his Forces went in abundance with the King of <HI>Poland</HI> (in person) and the Army, together with a great number of <HI>Cossacks,</HI> a∣gainst
<PB N="50" REF="12"/>the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> marching over the River <HI>Nieper;</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Boristhenes.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> however went on in their proceeding, subdu∣ing <HI>Shemnitz, Cremnitz,</HI> and other <HI>Mine-towns,</HI> and sending threatning Letters to the Magi∣strates thereabout, who being over-aw'd by the Terrour of those Menaces, moved the People under them to do homage to these <HI>Infi∣dels.</HI> The taking of the Fort <HI>Novigrad,</HI> (up∣on the strength whereof the People so much depended) did not a little conduce to the Sub∣jecting of the rest. And now they made their excursions toward <HI>Tokay,</HI> (where their Noblest Wines grow) a strong Hold, moted round about, &amp; alwayes reputed as invincible. Upon this place they practic'd both <HI>subtilty</HI> and <HI>force,</HI> as they had done before <HI>Novigrad;</HI> but honest men had the keeping of it, and so they were forc'd to passe it by.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Turks</HI> caused the late subdued <HI>Lewents</HI> to be demolish'd, as not lik∣ing the manner of the Fortification, and sent a Menacing Order to those of <HI>Frystadt,</HI> to dis∣patch out of hand two Bridges over the <HI>Waegh,</HI> larger then the former, and to make them broad enough for whole Squadrons to passe a Breast; And now they began to talk loud of another Invasion into <HI>Moravia;</HI> to which end, many thousands of the <HI>Tawny-Tartars</HI> throng'd
<PB REF="12"/>into the Camp, as if those of the other com∣plexion, had not yet playd the devils sufficient∣ly in the Country; Whereupon to prevent that Inrode, a <HI>Counter-mand</HI> was sent to most of those forces, that were now march'd, or march∣ing off to their <HI>Winter-Quarters;</HI> and Order given them to bend their Course toward the <HI>Waegh.</HI> Although this Countenance of the <HI>Turks</HI> design gain'd not much Credit, in regard of the season of the Year, it was however held for good discretion not to be too secure.</P>
<P>Near the end of <HI>November,</HI> came to <HI>Vienna-Baron de Goes</HI> (with leave of the <HI>Great Vizier,</HI> and in company of a <HI>Turkish Chiaux</HI> of <HI>Offen</HI>) who long time had been employ'd as the <HI>Em∣perours</HI> Agent toward the intended Treaty for Peace; which <HI>Baron,</HI> Affirmes that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> with the <HI>Tartar Cham,</HI> have resolved, with an Incredible Force, to come personally into the Field next Spring; and Joyn the ut∣most of their power against <HI>Christendome.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the taking of which Resolution, vast Quantities of Rice and Corne were Ordered at <HI>Adrinople,</HI> and <HI>Philippopoli</HI> to be carried to <HI>Greek-Weissenberg,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Offen.</HI> This determination and Proceeding, engaged the <HI>Christians</HI> to use their utmost Endeavours Possible, for the bringing of a considerable Bo∣dy into the Field next Spring; and to this pur∣pose,
<PB REF="13"/>his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty having first given Audience to the Report of the said <HI>Baron,</HI> gives immediate Order for Preparations; taking his Journey to the <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Regenspurg,</HI> to Stirr up the Princes of the <HI>Empire</HI> to a General Con∣junction against the <HI>Turk.</HI> In the <HI>Interim,</HI> the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles Joseph,</HI> being design'd to keep his Residence in <HI>Vienna,</HI> put himself up∣on the way thither from <HI>Lintz;</HI> but fell into such a weaknesse upon the Journey, that he was enforc'd to go back. The Chief Officers appointed to stay behinde in <HI>Vienna,</HI> applyed themselves with all diligence to the putting their Orders in Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Schinta</HI> was now provided afresh with Am∣munition and Provision, and the Great Artille∣ry removed from thence, the <HI>Montecuculish</HI> Army, which for a long time had been Quar∣terd near the <HI>Presburg Ship-Bridge,</HI> mov'd from thence toward <HI>Moravia.</HI> The Count <HI>de Souches</HI> conceived some hopes of recovering <HI>Neutra,</HI> and prepar'd accordingly; the loss of that place being reputed not much inferiour to the loss of <HI>New hausel: Neutra</HI> being an <HI>Eccle∣siastical</HI> Seat, <HI>New-hausel</HI> only a Seat for <HI>Soul∣diers,</HI> which begat a greater Zeal, and Earnest∣ness toward the Recovery of the Place.</P>
