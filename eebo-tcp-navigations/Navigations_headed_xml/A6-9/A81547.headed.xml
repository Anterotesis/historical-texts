<HEAD>The Translators PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of that little <HI>French</HI> Novel (whereof this is a Translation) in his Preface to the Reader, does assure him, that there is not any one Character in the whole Piece, which was drawn by the Life; and that he de∣sign'd it no otherwise then as a general Representation of those
<PB REF="3"/>many and great Extravagancies▪ which <HI>Bassett</HI> had occasion'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>France,</HI> and which were the Grounds of a late Edict; whereby not only that, but some other Games of the like Na∣ture, were publickly forbid.</P>
<P>Now if he cou'd s;ay so, how much more may the Translator; who, being an absolute Stranger to this Game, as well as all o∣thers, cannot reasonably be thought to have design'd this as a Reflection upon any Person whatever, especially since he did not think fit to lay the Scene in <HI>England.</HI> The Pastime of a few idle Hours, and the de∣sire of preserving that very lit∣tle
<PB REF="3"/>smattering in the <HI>French</HI> Language which he can pretend to, was all the Inducement or De∣sign he had in undertaking this present Translation; wherein (tho' he never intended it as a literal one,) there are but very few places, and those too little material, that vary from the Ori∣ginal.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISORDERS OF BASSETT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Day at Madam <HI>Gendrill's</HI> at <HI>Bassett,</HI> he that kept the Bank taillied with the great∣est Fortune in the World; he never lost so much as one <HI>Sept∣et-le-va,</HI> and seldom the <HI>Paroli,</HI> insomuch that he broke all the Setters; some were complaining and sighing, others crying, fretting, and swearing; every
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>one, in fine, had some particular way or other to express the great Concern he was in; a∣mongst whom Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> bore no small part, she having been a considerable loser; and that which vex'd her most, was to lose the same Card four times in one Deal. The Marquiss of <HI>Roziers,</HI> who was in Love with her, being extreamly afflicted to see her so concern'd, Madam, said he, set the rest of your Mo∣ney upon the Knave, I believe 'twill prove a good Card, ha∣ving lost twice already. You have never yet been lucky to me, Sir, said she, yet I'll ven∣ture for once; the <HI>Knave</HI> won a <HI>Sonica.</HI> Pray Madam, said the Marquiss, make the Paroli upon the same Card. Once more, Sir, said she, I must needs tell you, you were
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>not born to bring me good Luck, yet however I'll venture; the Knave won again. Now, Sir, said she, upon what Card shall we make the <HI>Sep-et-le-va?</HI> Ma∣dam, replyed the Marquiss, ve∣ry coldly, I was never born to bring you good Luck, therefore be pleas'd to chuse one your self. Pray, Sir, said she, think of a Card quickly. Madam, said the Marquiss, very heavily, you will certainly lose it; she made the <HI>Sept-et-le-va</HI> upon the Ace, the Ace lost; whereupon she rose up on a sudden, tore the Ace, and all her Book; and throwing the Pieces at the Mar∣quiss, I shou'd think it strange, said she to him, in an angry and disdainful way, if in all my Life, I shou'd thrive in any one thing, wherein I have to do with you; believe me, we two were
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>not born but to be a Plague to each other. The Marquiss tryed to pacifie her, and proffer'd he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Hand to wait on her home; but she refused it very Scorn∣fully, without so much as ta∣king the least notice of him. This Carriage of hers troubled him extreamly, and threw him into a deep Melancholy, which his Friend the Count <HI>de Charlois</HI> having perceiv'd, rose from <HI>Bas∣sett,</HI> and went away with him in his Coach.</P>
<P>When soon after, as the Mar∣quess was lolling very thought∣fully, the Count turning that way, and looking stedfastly upon him, said to him, Unhappy Wretch that thou art, to have a concern for one who does so little de∣serve it; a silly Coquette creature, whom none but your self wou'd ever have thought of. What do
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>you find in her, continu'd he, that is taking? She is lean, she has a wide Mouth. What, said the Marquiss, intetrupting him, do I see in her that is taking? Who ever saw more lovely and charming blew Eyes then hers are? Was there ever a clearer and a more delicate Complexion, a whiter and more even sett of Teeth, a better proportion'd Nose, or a more exact and easie shape then she has? Call you those lovely and charming Eyes, re∣ply'd the Count, which are so sunk into her Head; or that Com∣plexion delicate and clear, which sometimes is so hideous yellow? Her Nose is inclin'd to red, or looks blewish at the best: If her Teeth are white and even, 'tis that she uses Opiate Powders, and the File so often. Is that to bs exact∣ly and easily shap'd, to have such
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>an aukard gate as she has? Her Neck, I must confess is white; but yet, were it not for the Tay∣lor, 'tis such a one as no body wou'd see it. She's a Wit 'tis true, but a very dangerous, and ill∣natur'd one. If any Woman is Handsome, Airy, or any ways accomplish'd, she can't indure her, but in all Companies where e're she comes, is raising a thousand spiteful Stories of her. She hates all Woman-kind; but then, to make amends, she's is in love with all Mankind: And I believe you are the only Man she ever used ill; and that for no other reason, but because you have too much worth in you; a thing no ways agreeable to her humour. For my part I declare, if heretofore I have had any inclination for her, it has been a very slight one, and such as never went near to my
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>Heart. Count said the Marquiss, I'me told you two are not very well together. Troth reply'd the Count, very briskly, because I'me grown weary of her. She's a strange humour'd Woman, and 'tis almost impossible to please her. When I us'd to visit her I look'd as thin and lean as a Skele∣ton. What I now tell you, is not out of any spleen to her, but a real concern I have to see you so desperately ingaged, and a desire to cure you of so unreasonable and so unfortunate a Passion. A∣las! dear Count, reply'd the Marquiss; little do you know my heart in this matter; I am not my own Master as you think; my reason is quite given up, and whatever Difficulties and Argu∣ments she opposes to my Passion, serve but to make her more abso∣lutely imperious. Nay, what
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>way is there in the World, that I have not tryed to cure my self of the Passion I have for Madam <HI>Landroze;</HI> and yet all, alas! has serv'd only to make me more des∣perately in love with her. How often have I, quite disheartn'd by her slights, with Tears in my Eyes, said to her, Farewel Ma∣dam, and for ever farewel? Once I took up a resolution ne∣ver to see her more: but scarce cou'd I in pain, linger out two whole days in that mind, but I was forc'd to take up a new one. I am not, I wou'd then say, suf∣ficiently reveng'd of her in not seeing her any more; 'twere fit she shou'd see her self slighted, and me prefer another before her.</P>
<P>I went to Mass to the <HI>Petits Ca∣pucins,</HI> where I knew she us'd to go every day. I will salute her, thought I, but it shall be with
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>that coldness, and indifferency, that she shall soon perceive how little I value her; and if I show any Concern or Complaisance for any body, it shall be for Ma∣dam <HI>Rocheron</HI> her mortal Enemy. ah! thought I, so shall I be fuf∣ficiently reveng'd. But oh! the moment I spy'd her out in the Church, I forgot all my former Resolutions; and instead of a cold and a disdainful Behaviour, I saluted her with all the submis∣sive and languishing Looks ima∣ginable.</P>
<P>As I was discoursing with Ma∣dam <HI>Rocheron,</HI> I observ'd a Sha∣green in Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Looks: immediately, forgetting the De∣sign that brought me thither, I flew away in a great hurry, and confusion, without being able to beg her Pardon. When I came home, reflecting upon my weak∣ness;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>fly, fly, said I, every place where Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> is: there is nothing but absence can cure me. The Court was at <HI>Fontain∣bleau.</HI> I left <HI>Paris,</HI> and went thither, where I sought out for a hundred Pastimes, and Diver∣sions, to make me forget her; Walking, Gaming, Treating and Gallanting the Ladies, was the constant business of the day. Yet wou'd you wonder to see how this cruel Passion did slily shuffle it self into the midst of all my Diversions. I had not gone an hundred Yards into the Wood at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> when falling into a deep Melancholy, my Head ran of nothing but Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> and I wish'd to meet her there, that I might reproach her with In∣gratit ude. When ever I enter∣tain'd any of the Ladies with a∣ny piece of Gallantry, I insensi∣bly
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>address'd my self to her, who had most of the Air of Madam <HI>Landroze.</HI> At <HI>Bassett,</HI> at the Queen's, or any where else, when I have lost a <HI>Paroli</HI> or <HI>Sept-et-le-va;</HI> alas! said I to my self, Can so unfortunate a Crea∣ture as I am, ever hope to have good luck; when ever I have won, these are not the Joys, thought I, that can make me happy. In the midst of great Dainties, the delicate Flavour of the richest Wines imaginable, is no otherwise pleasant to me, then as it serves to amuze me with the vain Thoughts of what a concern she will be in to have lost me, and of being capable by that means to make her sensi∣ble of the loss.</P>
<P>All the while the Court was at <HI>Fontainbleau;</HI> I spent my time so miserably as I tell you; and by
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>this way of living. I was grown so moap'd, and so fall'n away, that no body cou'd have known me. Being sensible at last, that none of these Remedies were sufficient to cure me; I resolv'd to return to <HI>Paris,</HI> and throwing my self at her Feet, to ask her Pardon. But after I had given her a faith∣ful Account how dismally I spent my time at <HI>Fontainbleau;</HI> wou'd you believe what an Answer this Ungrateful Creature made me? Monsieur Marquiss said she, you have made good use of the time you spent in reading Romances, and have an admirable way of representing the Characters of those great Heroes. Oh cruel Creature! was ever the like said? Faith Marquiss, said the Count ve∣ry briskly, shall I tell you my mind plainly; you are a meer Novice in this Affair. Alas, what good
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>can you hope to make of such Florid Discourses: the Ladies of this Age, (especially such as Madam <HI>Landroze</HI>) are for some∣thing more substantial, and to the purpose. Are you in Love with a Woman, and wou'd you that she shou'd return it? find out what she takes most delight in, and make your Court to her that way. Is she Musically gi∣ven? entertain her with publick Musick-meetings, and treat her often at the <HI>Opera.</HI> If she loves Play, go halfs with her, and be sure never to let her want Mo∣ney. Do's she love fine Cloaths, and to be always well dress'd? Present her with the Richest, and most fashionable Silks you can meet with. If she loves to eat well, make her frequent enter∣tainments; and, as often as
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>may be; let 'em be given out of Town; and then if at any time, you find her in better hu∣mour, and more transported then ordinary, make use of the opportunity; bear up to her briskly, and be not frighted with the shew of a forc'd Mode∣sty: if she's angry beg her Par∣don, and lay the blame upon the violence of your Passion: Wo∣men are always easie to forgive Affronts of that nature: As soon as ever you are reconcil'd, be not afraid, but at her again, and try your Fortune three or four times more; till at last, take my word for't, you'l find that Happy and Critical Minute you look for. Count reply'd the Marquiss, you talk like an Errant Debaucheè: Know you not, that I naturally hate Debauchery, and desire no∣thing further of Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>then to make my self Master of her Heart? Alas! Poor Young Man, said the Count, a Woman's Senses and Affections always go together; So that whoever plea∣ses the former, may be sure not to miss of the latter. Well, well, Count, reply'd the Mar∣quiss, you, that pretend to be so bold, how wou'd you, were you in my place, behave your self before Madam <HI>Landroze?</HI> How? said the Count, very easily: She loves Play, and particularly <HI>Bassett;</HI> keep a Bank at her House, do you-tailliee, and let her be your Crouppier. I am acquainted with the Chevalier <HI>Briere,</HI> he is a cunning profess'd Gamester, knows all the Gamesters about <HI>Paris,</HI> and wou'd be glad with all his Heart to go in the Bank: He wall bring you as many Game∣sters as you desire. Madam
<PB N="16" REF="12"/><HI>Landroze</HI> is Covetous, and the advantage the Bank has over the Setters, is so great, that at the long run, you will infallibly be a considerable winner. This is the way you must take to win her Heart. By this means you will have an opportunity of see∣ing her ev'ry day, and of rally∣ing with her upon all those who lose their Money. As for the Chevalier, 'tis no matter whe∣ther he knows the Intrigue or no; for he has an admirable way of making Discoveries. In fine, you will be allow'd a great freedom, and have a thousand little secrets told you; and with∣out jesting, the Money she will win in going with you, will make you appear more amiable in her sight, and she consequent∣ly more sensible of the Passion you have for her. Ah! Count,
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>reply'd the Marquiss, what a Proposal have you made me, I have so great a Passion for Ma∣dam <HI>Landroze,</HI> that I cannot en∣dure the very thoughts of it; to keep a Bank at her house, and make it a publick Gameing Ordinary, and Rendevouze for all sorts of People, where every Rake-helly Sharper of the Town, and common Strumpet, is Hail-fellow-well-met with Persons of the best Reputation and Quali∣ty, to expose her every Minute to a thousand Foolleries, and impertinent Disputes and Quar∣rels: Fie! fie! 'tis a thing I can't endure to think of. Troth, re∣ply'd the Count, 'tis pleasant to see how wonderful nice, and ten∣der you are of Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Reputation; when, at this very instant, People of the best Qua∣ilty in all <HI>Paris,</HI> make no scruple
<PB N="18" REF="13"/>of having <HI>Bassett</HI> at their Houses; and I know some of very good Fashion, that neither care for <HI>Bassett,</HI> or any other sort of Gameing, and yet are desirous to have it at their Houses for the Profit of the Card-money; and if you'll do so for her, take my Word for't she'll never scruple it. Will you hold an hundred Pounds, continued the Count, that she does not agree to't, when you have once convinc'd her that there's Money to be got by't? All Women are Covetous, and she the most in the World. In fine, the Count made it so plain and clear to the Marquiss before he left him, that he went away with a Resolution of setting up a Bank at Madam <HI>Lan∣droze's</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning the Mar∣quiss of <HI>Rozier</HI>'s went to her
<PB N="19" REF="13"/><HI>Leveè,</HI> where having diverted the peevish humour she was in (as being but just up) he began to demonstrate to her how dis∣advantageous a Game <HI>Bassett</HI> was to the Setters, and how certain∣ly advantageous to them that keep the Bank, when there were a great many that play'd. That at <HI>Venice,</HI> where <HI>Bassett</HI> was first found out, the <HI>Venetians</HI> Farmed the sole Power and Right of keeping the Bank, at Fifty or Sixty thousand Crowns a year, which cou'd never turn to Ac∣count, were not the advantages which the Bank has infinitely great, as was easie to be com∣prehended; for Example, said he, there are Thirteen different Cards; suppose then, that the Gamesters set upon the Thirteen different Cards, it must necessari∣ly follow, that the last Card but
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>one is clear Gains to the Bank, in that the Dealer cannot loose the last Card, which is a <HI>ne v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> pas; besides, if all the Twelve Cards go every Deal, let 'em loose or win, one Card or other of the Thirteen will be fass'd; Judge therefore how great an advantage the Bank has. I must confess it does not so happen, that they set upon the Thirteen differ∣rent Cards every Deal, and that the Cards are not always well mixt, but that sometimes Two or Three of a sort shall come to∣gether, and at other times the Dealer's Card does not come till the Six last <HI>Taillieès;</HI> yet take it one time with another, the Bank has certainly a very great advantage; these Reasons, to∣gether with the Reflection she made, upon how much she had lost at that Game, made her re∣solve
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>for the future to leave it off. The Marquiss finding her in a right Temper for his design, propos'd to her to have <HI>Bassett</HI> at her House, that she shou'd keep the Bank, recommending to her the <HI>Chevalier Brierie,</HI> as one who wou'd be glad to have a share in it, as a Man of a gene∣ral Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI> and one who wou'd bring 'em Game∣sters enough. Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> lik'd the Motion, and readily a∣greed to it; and, after a little pause, she hinted to the Marquiss that with her late losses she was quite run out of her Money, yet that there was a Merchant she us'd to deal with, who up∣on some Allowance, and defalca∣tion for Interest, wou'd accept of an Assignment upon one of her Tenants, and advance her the next Years Rent upon it.
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>The Marquiss offer'd to lay down the Money, and make a Bank for her; which she refus'd, but bor∣row'd Three hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> of her Merchant, to which the Marquiss put Three hundred more, and the Chevalier as ma∣ny; so that they made up a Bank of Nine hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors.</HI> What with the pains the Chevalier took to divulge it, and the Reputation of the Persons concern'd, it was quickly known all the Town over; Gamesters came from all parts, and the ve∣ry second time they Dealt, there was so great a Crowd, that not∣withstanding the Table held above Thirty, there were several that cou'd get no room. The Marquiss taillied, and Madam <HI>Londroze,</HI> and the Chevalier crouppied. Sure nothing could be more Entertaining, than to
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>see a Number of People setting round a great Table, some looking pale, some red, some ready to split themselves with laugh∣ing, others swearing, storming, fretting, and making a hundred several Grimaces: Sometimes you shou'd see a young Heir, yet in deep Mourning for his Father, at one setting play away all that the good Old Gentle∣man had been scraping up for three or sour years together; the Pay-master of the Army the poor Soldiers Pay; Abbots their yearly Revenues; Officers their Pay; the new married Man his Wifes Portion; the Magistrate his Bribes; and married Women loose great Sums of Money, just before taken up upon their Necklaces and Jewels. Now and then you shou'd see some People, having lost all, rise up
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>and go away after a very despe∣rate manner, and of a sudden return with their Pockets full of <HI>Loüis d'ors;</HI> the purchase Mo∣ney of some Plate, or Suit of Hangings just expos'd to Sale: In fine, there was a great Ren∣devouze and Medly of all sorts of People; the young Heiress with the old Widow, the grave Statesman with the fluttering Courtier, the infamous Strum∣pet with the Ladies of Honour, and the Upstart Valet de Cham∣bre with his late Lord and Ma∣ster; a Scene then which no∣thing can be more ridiculously Pleasant: One time there were two Citizens Wives, who ha∣ving been considerable loosers, went home twice for fresh Re∣cruits; and having at length lost all they had, went away with Tears in their Eyes. The
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>Chevalier perceiving what a ta∣king they were in, and having a great Curiosity to hear what they said, went close after 'em in the Dark, and over-heard one saying to the other, What shall we do? Oh! Unfortunate Creatures! for my part, I am grown desperate, and wish to dye: you see Cousin, continued she, you must no longer make a Difficulty of giving up your Daughter to the Farmer gene∣ral of the Revenues, he has as∣sur'd me you shall never want Money, and 'tis the last Shift we can make; when he has done with her himself, he'll marry her off to one of his under Officers, or if he should not, yet are there many others who knowing nothing of the Matter, would be glad of her: The Men are meer Block-heads
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>in that Point, and my Husbanb, poor Man, who fancies himself a Conjurer, knows no more of that matter than another Man. In the mean time one of the Footmen coming with a Candle, the Cheva∣lier stole away, as fearing to be seen. Another time a young Lady betwixt Seventeen and Eighteen, handsom and well dress'd, being at play, and having very bad luck, the Chevalier over-saw her Card several times; which Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> taking notice of, watch'd it the more narrow∣ly; at last, after the loss of Two and twenty <HI>Loüis d'ors,</HI> she went away very discontentedly; whereupon the Chevalier fol∣lowing her, over-heard an Old Woman saying to her, Have not I often warn'd you of the danger of Play? What think you will your Mother say when
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>she sees you without the Pety∣coat? Were not the Two and twenty <HI>Loüis d'ors,</HI> she gave you, enough to have bought one, but you must play 'em away in hopes to get more, that you might have a Richer? You have done finely, han't you? for my part I look for nothing less than being turn'd out of Doors. Im∣mediately the Chevalier addres∣sing himself to the young La∣dy, told her he had over-heard their Discourse, assuring her how much troubled he was at her loss, it being no fault of his that she had not won, and that her Card had not been over seen every time. At first the young Lady blush'd, but the Chevalier proferr'd to lend her some Mo∣ney with so much Importunity, that, notwithstanding the many refusals she made, he at last in
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>a manner forc'd her to accept it. He waited upon her to a Shop, where they laid out Three and thirty <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> upon a Pety∣coat. He was with her a great while all alone. The next day she was engaged at <HI>Bassett,</HI> and so for several days together. She never was without Money. Ma∣dam <HI>Landroze,</HI> said the young Lady; was much oblig'd to the Chevalier, for supplying her so constantly with Money, and that she had found out the Mystery by their oagling each other: But certain it is, that about Two or Three Months after∣wards, there being a great deal of Company, she was miss'd on a sudden; and that one day her Woman, as she was unlacing her, told her plainly she never saw her Breast so high. She is slipt out of Town, and 'tis given out
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>she is gone into a Monastery. Another time, a Friend of the Chevalier's had just set his Foot into the Room where they were Dealing, when of a sudden he drew back to avoid being seen; the Chevalier made after him, and pressed him to come in; he desir'd to be excused, but the Chevalier being very earnest with him to know the Reason his Friend ask'd him, Did you, said he, mind the Old Gentle∣man that sat next you? yes, re∣ply'd the Chevalier; know then, said he, that he is worth Eight hundred thousand <HI>Livres,</HI> and has three Daughters to mar∣ry, that he goes about to the <HI>Bassett</HI> Tables only to take no∣tice who comes there, and if he finds any one that courts any of his Daughters at play he positively commands her, to
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>whom the Court is made, to break off with her Lover, and forbid him the House, protesting that no <HI>Bassett</HI>-player shall ever marry any Daughter of his. Now I being very well with the Eldest, and in no small hopes of getting her, she gave me this Advice, which I'm resolv'd to follow. The Chevalier being satisfied with this Reason, and going back into the <HI>Bassett</HI> Room, fell a rallying so severely upon the Old Gentleman, that he ob∣lig'd him to quit the Room, as looking upon him to be one that wou'd hinder their Cu∣stom.</P>
<P>Nothing can be a stronger Instance, to how great Extra∣vagances the love of <HI>Bassett</HI> may subject one, than what hapen'd to the young Count <HI>de Angluron;</HI> he was a Friend of the Cheva∣lier's
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>who meeting him one day in Town, ask'd him how chanc't, he, that was so great a lover of Play, had now quite left it off: The young Count told him, he was now wholly taken up another way; for that he was fallen desperately in Love with one of the most Beautiful Creatures in all <HI>France,</HI> of whom he was likewise not a little belov'd; that his Passion for her had perfectly cur'd him of that for Play. The Chevalier told him there was <HI>Bassett</HI> at Ma∣dam <HI>Landrozes,</HI> whether Peo∣ple of the best Fashion in Town did daily resort, and invited him to it, and to bring his Mistress along with him.</P>
<P>Next day the Count and his Mistress, the Marquiss of <HI>Ro∣ziers</HI> and the Chevalier, were at Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> very merry
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>together; but being too soon to begin to Deal, they fell into a Dis∣course about play. Madam <HI>Landro∣ze</HI> said, He that was given to play cou'd never make a good Lover, or be very observant to his Mi∣stress. The Marquiss of <HI>Roziers</HI> was of Opinion one might easi∣ly disengage himself from the love of play: In answer to which, the Chevalier in a rallying way said, that whoever has once plac'd his Affections upon play, can never wean himself from it as long as he lives. The Count <HI>de Angluron</HI> was for maintaining the contrary, and looking lan∣guishing upon his Mistress, said, That from his own Experience he cou'd prove, that Love was an infallible cure for any Inclina∣tion to play. And for my part, reply'd his fair Mistress, I think any Woman very ingrateful that
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>can't be of the same Mind. The Chevalier, for the Jest sake, still persisted in it, that no Man who, loves <HI>Bassett</HI> can ever leave it off for a Mistress; a Mistress, said he, may perhaps requite her Lover for the many Torments she makes him endure; but can she at any time give him a <HI>Pa∣roli,</HI> a <HI>Sept,</HI> a <HI>Quinze,</HI> or a <HI>Trent-et-le-va?</HI> No! no! never was any Ladies favour of that Con∣sequence. By this time the Company being come, they gave over the Discourse; and the Marquiss of <HI>Roziers</HI> began to Taillièe: Do but observe now what happen'd to the Count <HI>de Angluron;</HI> this Man, whom Love had so well cur'd of any desire of play, at first play'd but very little, and was taken up rather in watching his Mistresses Eyes, than his own Cards; he
<PB N="34" REF="21"/>lost 'em every one; then being heated, and in hopes his luck might turn, he set as much up∣on a Card at one time, as he had lost since he first began to play. He lost it; whereupon he doubl'd and doubl'd on, loosing some Cards, and winning o∣thers; of every Card that he won, he made the <HI>Paroli</HI> and a <HI>Sept-et-le-va,</HI> which he still lost; so that after this manner he had plaid off One hundred and fifty <HI>Loüis d'ors.</HI> He went out, and sent for the Chevalier into the next Room, where he profer'd to sell him his Coach and Hor∣ses. The Chevalier thought it a good Bargain, and bought 'em: This Money was as little lucky to the Count, for he soon lost it. A second time he sent for the Chevalier out into the next Room, to sell him his Mistresses
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>Diamond Clasps. The Cheva∣lier at first was unwilling, but the Count, as also his Mistress, in complaisance to him, did so press and importune him to it, that at last the Chevalier bought the Diamond Clasps. That Money lost, he sold the Pearl Necklace too, as little lucky as the rest. The Count <HI>de Anglu∣ron</HI> grown desperate with all these losses, taking the Cheva∣lier aside, pray'd him to let him have some Money upon his Note, protesting solemnly he wou'd re∣pay it in two or three days: The Chevalier seem'd not to mind him, having made an Oath ne∣ver more to lend a Farthing without a Pawn, by reason of some disputes he had lately had with some of his best Friends upon the like occasion. Well, said the Count, in a great con∣cern,
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>will you lend it me if I pawn to you the thing of the World I value most, and which I wou'd Redeem at the expence of my Life; 'tis that Beautiful Creature that came along with me, I will leave her in your hands, till such time as I have repay'd you to a Farthing of what shall borrow; doubt not, my dear Chevalier, but some time before the end of the Week you shall have your Money, and in the mean time I shall take it as the greatest Obligation imagi∣nable. The Chevalier surprized to hear of such a kind of Pawn, and calling to mind that he had but just before heard the Count maintain, that Love was an In∣fallible cure for any Inclination to play, was so pleas'd with this Passage, that 'twas as much as he cou'd do to forbear laugh∣ing
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>out right. He told the Count very coldly, that he cou'd not take that Pawn, for what, said he, wou'd you have me do with that young Woman? What would I have you do with her, replyed the Count? Alas! what shou'd one do with so precious a Pawn? What sou'd one do? do by her like a Man of Honour; whereupon the Chevalier desir'd him to think no more on't. Go then, said the Count, pulling his Hat over his Eyes, and turning short from him, you have dealt un∣worthily by me, and I'll declare it to all the World, you don't play like a Gentleman; so flung out of doors, without so much as thinking of his Mistress, who all this while was seeing 'em play at <HI>Bassett,</HI> and forc'd to walk home on foot, the Coach
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>and Horses having been not long before sold and deliver'd up.</P>
<P>There were several other no less pleasant Passages at this <HI>Bassett</HI>-Bank, which I purpose∣ly forbear to take notice of, that I may come to speak of the Passion which the Marquiss of <HI>Roziers</HI> had for Madam <HI>Lan∣droze.</HI> The Count <HI>de Chariots</HI> hearing of the vast Sums of Mo∣ney which this Bank had won, had a Curiosity to know how well the Marquiss of <HI>Roziers</HI> had succeeded in the advice he gave him to gain Madam <HI>La∣drozes</HI> Heart; and to that end he made him a Visit. She is wonderfully pleas'd, said the Marquiss, and is often counting over the great gains she has made by the Bank. She's al∣ways in good Humour, and when
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>we are by our selves, we rallyèe upon those whose Money we win; but as for what Advances I have made, towards the Ma∣stery of her Heart, they are lit∣tle more than what I made the very first day. Do not you Marquiss, said the Count, make the right use of her being in good Humour, and wait for the Critical Minute? Believe me, reply'd the Marquiss, I loose nothing for want of assurance, but she puts me by, and rebukes me with so much Indignation, that I often begin to despair. Is it, said she, once to me, be∣cause I sometimes vouchsafe you my Company at play, that there∣fore you presume to take this Liberty? Very fine! indeed Monsieur Marquiss, that is not like to be the Price of our Bank. Therefore Count, continued the
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>Marquiss, to deal plainly with you, yours has fail'd, so that I must now think of some other way. Well, reply'd the Count, I'll tell you one, that can't pos∣sibly fail; Contrive all you can to loose, and quite ruin the Bank; put Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> up∣on borrowing of every body, up∣on pawning all her Jewels and Moveables; she's extrava∣gant, and so excessively fond of Play, that rather then want Mo∣ney for <HI>Bassett,</HI> there is not any thing she won't sell, pawn, or promise to do: I'll undertake, that when she's under such Cir∣cumstances, she'll be no longer reserv'd to you, and 'twill be in your own power to make your self Happy. But how, said the Marquiss, interrupting him, do you mean by ruining our Bank, and what way shou'd I do it?
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>I mean, reply'd the Count, that you shall agree with some of your Friends, to come and play deep, while you being to deal, shall so shuffle the Cards, as that they may win; then which nothing can be more easie, let them make the <HI>Paroli,</HI> the <HI>Sept,</HI> and <HI>Quinze-et-le-va,</HI> and in a short time, take my Word for't they'll break the Bank, Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> shall borrow of every body, pawn all she can rap and rend for Money to make a new one, which shall have as ill suc∣cess as the former; and never believe me more, if when you have once reduc'd her to that Condition, you do not find her more Affable and Courteous; if you are unwilling to intrust a Secret of this Nature to any of your own Friends, I'll help you to some fit Persons, and en∣gage
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>the Chevalier to joyn with you in this thing; for he's a Man no ways nice in these Matters, provided he suffer not in point of Interest. Ah! Count, reply'd the Marquiss ve∣ry hastily, what a Proposal have you made me? I play Crimp? I that so detest all such knavish Practises? I cheat Madam <HI>Lan∣droze,</HI> a Person I doat on above all things in this World? Think you I can be so hard-hearted, as to bear up against those Af∣flictions, which the being redu∣ced to such Extremities must inevitably throw her into? No! no! Count, you don't know me; and let me assure you, I had ra∣ther despair of ever obtaining any favour from her, then purchase it that rate. Faith Marquiss, reply'd the Count, you mistake me quite, I propose to you the
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>cheating Madam <HI>Landroze?</HI> I never had any such Thought in my Head, and I'm sorry, that as you'r my Friend, you should know me no better; my mean∣ing is, that you shou'd restore her all the Money she looses; but that being reduc'd to such streights, she might think she owes all to you which you re∣turn to her, and so can refuse you nothing: Don't be appre∣hensive of how great a concern she may be in, but think rather how highly she will look upon her self to be oblig'd, and what Acknowledgments thereof she will make to you; this, in my Judgment, is the only way to prove successful in your Amour; now chuse you whether you'll make use on't. The Marquiss of <HI>Roziers</HI> having better consi∣der'd of the Proposal, and the
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>Reasons wherewith the Count <HI>de Charlois</HI> had enforc'd it, ap∣proved of it very well. The Persons who were to manage it came to the Marquiss to re∣ceive their Instructions; the Chevalier being assur'd by the Count, that there was no∣thing intended but a piece of Gallantry, and that Madam <HI>Lan∣droze</HI> shou'd have her Money a∣gain, readily assented to it: As for the Marquiss, all his Business was practicing to shuffle the Cards, and to remember what the Count had taught him. They agreed amongst themselves what Cards shou'd win, and the Marquiss's Valet de Chambre, who waited at the <HI>Bassett</HI> Ta∣ble, and to whom it belong'd to bring his Master the Cards when he dealt, had his Lesson given him how to place 'em:
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>In fine, matters were so well manag'd, that at the third set∣ting down, the Bank was quite broke, and the Persons design'd won all the Money. Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> immediately pawn'd all her Jewels, Plate, Furniture, and whatever else she cou'd make Money of to set up a new Bank, which held out not above four settings. The next Day af∣ter this second Bank was broke, the Marquiss made her a Visit a∣bout the time they us'd to begin play. He found her lying in a careless Posture upon a Pa∣late-Bed, leaning upon her El∣bow, in such a melancholy Fit, that he hardly knew her: He sat himself down in an Elbow Chair that stood by the Bed side, and having for some time fix'd his Eyes languishing upon her, Let us not Madam, said he,
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>disguise the matter, I see plainly what a trouble you are in for your late Losses, whereof I have so great a Resentment, that I wou'd readily Sacrifice all I am worth in the whole World, to bring you out on't: Ah! Ma∣dam, how happy shou'd I be, cou'd you but imagin how plea∣sant those Services are to a Lover, which he pays to his Mistress; be pleas'd, said the Marquiss, pulling a Bag from under his Cloak, and throwing it upon the Bed, to accept of these Twelve hundred <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> for your present occasions; I have still a Foond left to set up the Bank again, which I intend to venture. We have had an ill run long enough, and may now reasonably hope for a turn; yet shou'd we loose this Foond, I can find Credit for another; upon
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>the whole matter, I'm resolv'd, tho' I hazard every Farthing I am worth in the World, to try to change your Luck. But a∣las! Madam, while there is not any thing I wou'd not do to serve you, may not I hope you will do something for my sake? you cannot be insensible how long, and with how violent a Passion I have ador'd you, tho' to this minute I never met with the least return of any thing, but Scorn and Cruelty; How many severe shocking things have you said to me? How little Inclination had you ever to any thing I propos'd? and how un∣mov'd have you ever been at the Torments I endur'd for your sake? And now, Madam, my Passion is grown to that height, that without some undeniable Proofs of your Love to me, 'tis impos∣sible
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>I shou'd live any longer. Well then Marquiss, said Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> fetching a great sigh, since it must be so, I will now free∣ly own the Passion I have for you, which hitherto, (for some pri∣vate Reasons best known to my self) I have thought fit to con∣ceal; yes Marquiss I do love you, and that too a thousand times more than you do me. Do you love me, Madam, reply'd the Marquiss, interrupting her? and yet have treated me all this while with so much Cruelty and Disdain? Call you that Love? if, Madam, you would make me believe you love me, turn all your Frowns into Smiles, and let a thousand unspeakable Joys make amends for those many Torments I have so long in∣dur'd; a Reservedness to those we love, argues a great coldness
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>and indifferency in our Love; let your care in omitting no Oppor∣tunity of doing me a Favour be an Argument of your Love, and to make it unquestionable; let its violence appear in some more than ordinary Attempt. What, Mon∣sieur Marquiss, reply'd Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> wou'd you have me grant your request, the very minute I've receiv'd the Obliga∣tions from you? No! no! my Love is too real ever to express it self in an Act of Kindness, that looks more like paying a Debt, then the free gift of a generous Passion; 'tis my Heart you desire, let her alone then, freely to dispense her Favours according to the Dictates of her own Inclinations, and after a lit∣tle Patience, you will have no reason to complain. Oh! in∣grateful, continued Madam <HI>Lan∣droze,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>you reproach me with my being severe and rigid to you, when alas 'twas the Natural re∣sult of that great Love I bore you. Yes (since 'tis to no pur∣pose to conceal it any longer) I protest ingenuously to you, when ever I fancied you did any thing that did not answer those tender Thoughts I hoped you had for me, I fell into a Rage so beyond all Reason, that I hardly knew what I did: Alas! you little think how much you were oblig'd to me, for even then, when in my Looks and Actions there appear'd the greatest dis∣dain, I ador'd you from the bot∣tom of my Hart, and felt an in∣ward concern for you, which till that instant I was a Stranger to. I set my self to study your Humour, and found the only way to secure your Heart to me,
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>was to keep it in a perpetual Motion; for, if at any time it had nothing further to desire, it began to grow cold and abate much of its fondness, the loss whereof I so dreaded, that there was not any desperate Remedy in the World I wou'd not make use of to prevent it. Ah! did you but know how many Tears and Sighs, that affected Coiness and Scorn, I shew'd, has constantly cost me, how wou'd you, instead of upbraiding me with it, have thought your self oblig'd to have pittied me. But oh! Words are too weak symptoms of a bleed∣ing Heart, that is ever attended with more violent ones; here then, I give my self up to your Desires, do with me as you think fit; Inhuman Creditor! pay your self, come, Cruel, as thou art! Why dost thou stand off? then
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>looking languishing on him with Tears in her Eyes, she threw her self at his Feet; Pardon said she, pardon, my dear Mar∣quiss, I am sensible you have too much Honour to use any force, and if I refuse you at present, impute it only to the struglings of a disabled Virtue, just yield∣ing to the power of Love.</P>
<P>Just as she had said these Words, the Chevalier <HI>Brierie</HI> came into the Room, and found her at the Marquiss's Feet; but she hearing some body tread very softly behind her, and perceiving in the Glass just opposite to her, that 'twas the Chevalier, con∣tinued still at the Marquiss's Feet, and seeming as tho' she had not seen the Chevalier, immediate∣ly turn'd the Discourse in this manner. No! Sir, No, I'm re∣solv'd never to rise from this Po∣sture,
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>till you have promis'd me not to fight with my Brother. I ask you a thousand Pardons for whatever he has said to you, he's a passionate hot-brain'd Fellow, and grown desperate to find him∣self oblig'd to repay me the Mo∣ney I lent him. As she was say∣ing these Words, she turn'd her Head about to the Chevalier on a sudden, seeming to wonder what noise she heard; then, as tho' surpris'd to see him there, she started up on a sudden, having first wink'd upon the Marquiss to withdraw, which accordingly he did, but in so great a hurry and confusion, at what had late∣ly befallen him, that he had much a do to find his way home. Ah! dear Chevalier, said Madam <HI>Lan∣droze</HI> very heavily, I am undone, I am the most unfortunate Crea∣ture on Earth, if you don't take
<PB N="54" REF="31"/>pity on me; for the love of God use all the interest you have with the Marquiss not to fight with my Brother; but Oh! that thoughtful and reserv'd Look, which he went away with, has dash'd all my hopes, for I have ever observ'd it to be the surest sign of a revengeful Temper. Feigning at last to come to her self she told the Chevalier 'twou'd have done her a great kindness, had he hapen'd to come but a Minute sooner; that having lost her Money at <HI>Bassett,</HI> she was forc'd to dun her Brother for what he ow'd her; who there∣upon brought her that Bag which he saw upon the Bed, shewing him that which the Marquiss laid there that her Brother fell very severe upon her for playing at <HI>Bassett,</HI> which kept her al∣ways at home, that she was
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>peek'd at it, and so they came to high Words, that in the heat of the Dispute the Marquiss ve∣ry unfortunately came in, and offer'd to take her part; at which her Brother was so incens'd, that they fell to Words, and in the Passion they were in, but for the respect the Marquiss had to her, they had drawn upon each other in her Chamber; that her Bro∣ther went out first threatning the Marquiss, that she had done all she cou'd to prevent the Mar∣quiss from following him; yet that she was still in a perpetual fright of what might ensue hereupon. The Chevalier with all his cunning was caught in the Trap, and being naturally impatient, after having promis'd to do her what Service he cou'd in this matter, he immediately took his leave of her. He un∣derstood
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>at the Lodgings, where Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Brother lay, that he went out in the Morn∣ing early, and had not dined at home; as for the Marquiss he was but just gone to bed, and had left word if any body came he was not to be spoken with. This confirm'd the Chevalier in what Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> had just before told him, and made him try to prevent the mischief which he thought he luckily foresaw. The Marquiss tho in Bed, as they told the Chevalier, was so far from being asleep, that 'tis not to be imagin'd, how restless and distracted his Thoughts were; when he re∣flected upon those tender and passionate Expressions where∣with Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> had lately Entertain'd him, he was Tran∣sported with Joy even to a de∣gree
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>of Madness. What, said he to himself, does Madam <HI>Lan∣droze</HI> love me, and conceal it on∣ly to preserve me more constant to her? Is it possible that all those Cruelties I've indur'd from her, shou'd be only the Effects of a melancholy Apprehension, least I did not love her so passionately as she cou'd wish? Yes! yes! neither the loss of Reputation, or fear of what might happen, cou'd with-hold her from giving her self up to me to do what I wou'd with her; 'tis I only that am a trouble to her, least what ever she does for me, I shou'd impute rather to Design, than the free Motives of a disinterest∣ed Love. Fear nothing, continu∣ed he, shall I ruin your Reputa∣tion, shall I, that have so great an Adoration for you, expose you to the violent Prosecutions,
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>and fury of a Jealous Husband? No! no! I renounce the Thoughts of any pleasure that you must purchase at so dear a rate; the enjoyment of your Heart is all I ask, and 'tis that, and only that can make me the happiest or unhappiest Man breathing. Then again, falling headlong from that high Rap∣ture into a deep Melancholy, What, said he, what have I done, to deserve so much kindness from her? Is it by Treachery, Cruel∣ty, and Cheating? What to have betray'd her basely, to have been so cruel as to make her loose her Money, to have seen her so reduc'd as to sell her Jewels, Plate, and Furniture, to have stood unmoved at her greatest Despair, to have plaid the Pick-pocket, and hired Peo∣ple to assist me in cheating her?
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>Are these the Stratagems to con∣quer Hearts? thus, and much more than can be express'd, did the Marquiss rave all Night? When he had call'd to mind that he had suffer'd Madam <HI>Lan∣droze</HI> to throw her self at his Feet, he was almost distracted, and call'd himself an unmanner∣ly Brute; when he consider'd the Chevalier <HI>Brierie</HI> had surprized him in this Posture, and over∣heard what he said, he was so confounded that he knew not what to think; he cou'd not ima∣gin what Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> meant by desiring him not to fight with her Brother; and how she came off with the Chevalier; and what troubled him yet more, was, that he had taken notice how very observant the Cheva∣lier us'd to be to Madam <HI>Lan∣droze,</HI> which made him think he
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>loved her, and mistrust least his Rival, by telling her how she had been cheated, shou'd ruin his Interest with her to all In∣tents and Purposes; thereupon he thought the safest way wou'd be to begin first, and throw him∣self at her Feet, in hopes to merit his Pardon by a voluntary confession of the Crime: He thought the Night very tedious, and waited for Day with great impatience to execute his De∣sign; at last the Hour of seeing Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> being come, he was in haste to be going, but just as he got to the Door, he found some of the Guards there, which a Marshal of <HI>France</HI> had sent; 'tis not to be imagin'd, how wonderfully troubled and surprized he was at so strange a disappointment; he sent present∣ly for the Count <HI>de Charlois</HI> to un∣fold
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>this Mystery to him. The Count understood by his Friend the Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> who sent 'em, that the Chevalier <HI>Brierie</HI> had informed him of a Duel that was to be fought by the Mar∣quiss of <HI>Rozeirs,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Lisle,</HI> Brother to Madam <HI>Lan∣droze,</HI> upon a Quarrel that hap∣ned lately betwixt 'em. There∣upon he went to the Chevalier, who told him how he had found Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> at the Maquiss's Feet, and all that she had said to him. The Count returning to the Marquiss complain'd of his unkindness in not acquainting him with the late business be∣twixt him and <HI>Lisle.</HI> The Mar∣quiss, who did not then call to mind that <HI>Lisle</HI> was Madam <HI>Lan∣droze's</HI> Brother, and what she had said to him upon the Che∣valier's surprizing her at his
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>Feet, protested to him with a thousand solemn Imprecations, he was so far from having had any late dispute with <HI>Lisle,</HI> as that he had not either spoken to, or so much as seen him this Twelvemonth. If what you say be true, reply'd the Count, ei∣ther the Chevalier is the greatest Impostor, or Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> the most deceitful and designing Woman alive. Afterwards the Marquiss, as he was telling him of some particular Passages that happen'd the day before at her House, began to remember, how upon the Chevalier's surprizing her at his Feet, she intreated him not to fight with her Bro∣ther, and made signs to him to withdraw; which accordingly he did, leaving the Chevalier with her all alone: This made him sensible of the Truth of
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>what had been told him, and considering how serviceable the Count might be to him on this occasion, he told him ingeniously every particular Circumstance of the whole Affair, and desir'd his advice and assistance therein. Forthwith the Count went to the Chevalier, assuring him the busi∣ness was made up, and that 'twas for Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Credit that it shou'd not take Air; so they went together to testifie the same to the Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> and to get an Order for recal∣ling the Guards. This order came very opportunely, for they who were sent to serve <HI>Lisle</HI> had not as yet been with him; but staying to drink a Glass of Wine at a Tavern-next Door to his Lodgings, there they received the Countermand. The Mar∣quiss of <HI>Roziers</HI> was in a con∣tinual
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>fright at what Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Brother wou'd think of the matter, and the great prejudice it might be to her Re∣putation. As soon as the Count <HI>de Chariots</HI> had brought him an account of the happy success of his Negotiation, he fell into a Discourse about Madam <HI>Londro∣ze's</HI> death: Marquiss, said the Count, where was your Wit to loose▪ so fair an opportunity? Troth, I know not what to make of you, thou hast lost thy self in her Opinion beyond all hope of recovery; for let me tell thee, all such faults are un∣pardonable with Women. Is it possible thou shouldst come to this Age, and not know that Women use such little Tricks, only to decoy and bring Men on with greater eagerness, Count, reply'd the Marquiss very brisk∣ly,
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>if you knew Madam <HI>Lan∣droze</HI> you'd be of soother mind. She's all Truth, of a tender Dis∣position, Generous, uncapable of any little Trick, and endued with a thousand other extraor∣dinary Accomplishments, which few ether Women cou'd ever pretend to; nay I know her Temper so well, that she can least defend her self against that way of Courtship I have always used to her: I have ever sacri∣ficed my Will to her Interest and Pleasure, whereby she is assured how much I love her better than my own Life; 'Tis suffi∣cient to secure her to me as long as she lives. Alas! Marquiss, said the Count, shrugging up his Shoulders, you'll never do any great Feats amongst the Women; the way, continued he, to have
<PB N="66" REF="37"/>gain'd Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> and kept her sure to you as long as you'd a mind to't, bad been to have made use of the opportu∣nity she gave you; 'tis by that, as by some secret Charm, a Man gets so great an asendant over a Womans mind, that she can deny him nothing, humours him in all things, falls out with the whole World in his Cause is careless of her carriage to her Husband, or the concerns of her Family, values not her Reputa∣tion: In fine, if her Gallant be but a bold experienc'd Sinner she enters in without the least reluctancy, and stops at no Crime tho never so execrable. What you say Count, reply'd the Marquiss, is very true of lew'd debauch'd Women, and such as have lost all sence of Repueati∣on;
<PB N="67" REF="37"/>but all Women are not un∣der such Circumstances, and Ma∣dam <HI>Landroze,</HI> of whom we were speaking, least of any Woman in all <HI>France.</HI> Once more, re∣ply'd the Count, I must needs tell you, I find you do not know the Sex; there are hardly any, and especially Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> but what are Fantastical in their Amours; they suffer them∣selves to be hurried away I know not how: When ever they love or hate, they can give no Reason for either, but are equally in∣clin'd to both by a whimsical and unaccountable Humour; they are true to nothing, but their In∣terest, or when they want an Opportunity to be false; they are naturally Coquets, and their affected Virtue is nothing but a Cloak to their Coquettry.
<PB N="68" REF="38"/>They have design in all they say or do; but above all Tears are the Masterpiece of their Cun∣ing, and the surest Baits to catch the wariest Cudgeons. Though I, continued the Count, defie even those, as well as all others, and what I now tell you, I have either had experience of, or ob∣served in most Women. I have known 'em leave very worthy deserving Persons, whom they once had a great kindness for, and who have had no less for them, to take up with pittiful inconsiderable Fellows: Some∣times because they either danc'd or sung well; sometimes being dazled with the glittering of a rich Embroidred Coat, a well fancied Equipage, or a hundred other such fantastical Reasons. One day a married Woman, la∣menting
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>the loss of her Lover, who was kill'd in the War, said to me, Alas! poor Youth, how lovely he was, and how dearly he lov'd me? How often have we ran the Balls together? How often has he carried me to Plays? then fetching a deep Sigh, Oh! unfortunate Wretch, said she, that I am! Farewel Balls, fare∣wel Plays, they are all over with me, for who is there now that will carry me to 'em? No! no! I shall never see any more. An∣other time a Widow, the very first year of her Mourning, view∣ing her self in the Glass, said to me (as I was standing by) with Tears in her Eyes, Ah! Sir, what a loss have I had of my Husband? At which I began se∣riously to Comfort her: Com∣fort, reply'd she sighing, talk
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>not to me of Comfort; see what an ill Air this Bandore has, bow frightful this plain Linning makes me appear? What Man will endure now to look upon me? when I han't patience to see my self in the Glass?</P>
<P>But to say no more of other Women, let's come to Madam <HI>Landroze.</HI> What think you of the Artifice she used to blind the Chevalier, of the Reason why he found her at your Feet? For my part, I think it a Masterpeice to see a come-off, so well contriv'd, and acted so to the Life on a sudden. Well! well! Count, re∣ply'd the Marquiss, let's have no more on't, you have said enough, and I verily believe you are so great a Woman hater, that, shou'd I let you run on, you'd
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>reap up the Story of the <HI>Ephesian</HI> Matron, 'tis not in this, con∣tinu'd he, I ask your advice, but what I shou'd do with Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> as to the Moneys I made her loose, for I have still in my Hands above Eight hun∣dred <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> of hers, over and above the Twelve hundred I left with her that day the Chevalier found her upon her Knees. He told him he thought he had great reason to distrust the Chevalier, that he was in a continual fright, least he shou'd betray him in making a discove∣ry to Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> which wou'd ruin him in her Opini∣on to all Intents and Purposes; that he had thoughts to prevent it by restoring to her what Mo∣ney he had of hers, and ma∣king an open Confession of the
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>whole matter, in hopes she may pardon it as the rash Act of a violent Passion. The Count was of another mind, he main∣tain'd there was no Reason to distrust the Chevalier, that such a Confession can never take with Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> who will infallibly look upon the whole design to be no better than a down-right Cheat, that the better way were, to let her win it back again the same way she lost it; that if he was in haste to have it done, he might make a match to taillèe at her House to day, that he shou'd return the Money to the same Persons that won it before, and appoint 'em to be there on pur∣pose to loose it back again, by which means they will see plainly, he did not design Chea∣ting;
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>and shou'd the Chevalier chance to speak on't, as he mis∣trusted, the Event was sufficient to justifie the Act. Besides, said he, if the Town should come to talk of a Quarrel be∣tween you and Madam <HI>Landro∣ze's</HI> Brother, when they see you Taillying at her House, 'twill be look't upon as an idle Report, and soon be forgotten. The Marquiss approved of what was said. The Count went to the Chevalier, and the other Per∣sons who were to loose the Money, to acquaint 'em with the design, and give 'em the Money, with all Orders necessary there∣unto. Then he gave notice to several other Gamesters that there would be <HI>Bassett</HI> at Ma∣dam <HI>Landroze's</HI> about Six of the Clock. As for the Marquiss he
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>went to Madam <HI>Landroze's,</HI> and told her what the Chevalier had said to the Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> how they sent some of the Guards to him, and what bad hapen'd thereupon. Afterwards he proposed to her the taillying at her House about Six of the Clock: She desir'd nothing more then to play, and was only troub∣led that they did not begin two Hours sooner.</P>
<P>There chanc't to be a great deal of good Company there that day, who design'd to play deep: But just as the Marquiss had drawn out the Bank mo∣ney, in order to Tallièe, and the Setters made choice of their Cards, they heard a great noise in the Street, they saw a pub∣lick Officer with a Trumpet be∣fore him, and a piece of Parch∣ment
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>in his Hand, in the midst of a great crow'd, and heard him pronounce the Word <HI>Bassett</HI> several times, but cou'd make nothing of what he said. Mean while the Company being greatly puzzl'd to know the meaning on't, in came an Old Gentleman, Husband to a young Lady who was then present, and had set several <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> upon a Card: With great Joy in his Looks, he told 'em, it was an Order of Council to forbid <HI>Bassett;</HI> then looking a little angrily, he commanded his Wife not to play; she laught at him, and the more he forbid her, the more pressing she was with the Marquiss to deal on: The Penalty of the Order, said he, is Five hundred <HI>Livres</HI> for∣feiture upon every one that
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>plays, Three thousand upon him that keeps the Bank, and the House where they play to be shut up. This perplex'd and madded all the Company. Ma∣dam <HI>Landroze</HI> was for rallying it off, and said, she liked the Company too well to shut her Doors against 'em. The Mar∣quiss was loath to incur the For∣feiture of Three thousand <HI>Livres.</HI> The Chevalier, enraged at the Order, was very positive, and of∣fer'd to lay Five hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors,</HI> one might safely play the rest of that day; however there being few of his Mind, they broke up and went away with∣out it. As they were going off, he endeavour'd to perswade 'em to come back, but finding it to no purpose, told 'em, that the forbidding <HI>Bassett</HI> was of a
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>mighty consequence, which he was desirous to communicate to 'em, and therefore invited 'em all to Supper. The Ladies, and all those Gentlemen who were Strangers to the Chevalier, thank'd him for his Invitation, and went away, while such as were his Friends and Acquain∣tance, went along with him to the <HI>Petit-Paris,</HI> where he be∣spoke a Supper. The Marquiss promis'd the Chevalier to be there as soon as he. In the mean time, as the Company were taking their leaves, he counted over his Money, and put Eight hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> in a Purse by it self. Then find∣ing himself alone with Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> he offer'd her the Purse, in which the Eight hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> were, confessing the
<PB N="78" REF="43"/>whole Cheat, in hopes she wou'd pardon him, and look upon't as the excess of Love. While he was speaking. Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> turn'd sometimes pale, sometimes red, and chang'd Col∣lour above a hundred times. What, said she, to him, reaching out her Hand to take the Purse, is it possible? and are these Eight hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors,</HI> and the Twelve hundred you left here yesterday, my own? Which the Marquiss assuring her: Well, said she to him, you are a Man of Honour, and I forgive you freely; in full assurance whereof, as likewise how much I look upon my self to be interested in any thing that concerns you, I will make you an intire Confi∣dent in all my Thoughts. Ah! Madam, said the Marquiss, in∣terrupting
<PB N="79" REF="43"/>her, how good and how obliging you are, and how sensible am I of it; nay fur∣ther, continued she, I'll give you advice which makes against my self, and if you're wife you'll follow it: but for fear any body shou'd come in, and surprize me with this Purse in my Hand, let me go lock it in my Cabinet: which accordingly she did, and being come back again; Troth, Marquiss, said she, I had a narrow escape yesterday, for my ill For∣tune at play had reduced me to so great an Extremity, that I protest I had not the power to deny you any thing you cou'd ask me: But thanks to Provi∣dence, and my own little Cun∣ning, I am now safe deli∣ver'd. But withal, Sir, continu∣ed she, I must needs say you
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>have not lost much by't; for whatever you had done with my Person, I had from my very Heart detested the Action, and lookt upon it only as a hard Ransom, to Redeem me out of that Slavery whereinto my late Losses had unfortunately thrown me. Know Marquiss that my Affections are otherwise enga∣ged, and that too, to the most ungrateful Man breathing, one, who once had, or at least counterfeited a strong Passion for me; and oh! if 'twas coun∣terfeited, 'twas done to the Life; one, who has a thousand times sworn to love me as long as he liv'd: However the Traytor has proved false, and what is yet worse, Falshood has been so far from curing me of my Love, that it has rather increas'd it
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>the more. Once when I upbraid∣ed him with his Ingratitude, and beg'd him to return to the Pas∣sion he formerly had for me; Cou'd I, said he, Ah! Madam, how gladly would I do't? Can there be a greater Happiness in the World, than that of loving where one is belov'd; but we are not so much Masters of our own Hearts, I value you above any Person breathing, and wou'd readily sacrifice my Life and Fortune to your Service; but I beg you not to exact the Tribute of a Heart which is not in my own power to dispose of: A hundred, and a hundred times have I call'd my self perjur'd and ingrateful, and blush'd at the shame of so infamous a Cha∣racter; but how in vain are all such Attacks, upon a Heart re∣solv'd
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>never to surrender? I thought this Discourse so very ridiculous, that I broke off with my Faithless Lover, and forbid him from ever more corning near me; and yet Marquiss, 'tis but too great a Truth, and what I have experimented up∣on you, that the Heart is a head strong Libertine, that will love only where it pleases. How often have I, to the most advantage that cou'd be, re∣minded my self of the great Ob∣ligations I owe you, of your high Merit, and Passionate Af∣fections for me, with frequent Suggestions to my self, how happy I shou'd be in your Love, cou'd I but love you again? I en∣deavour'd by such gentle Stra∣tagems as these, to surprize my Heart, and make it come over
<PB N="83" REF="45"/>to you, till having by degrees got a Habit of loving you, it shou'd declare for you against that perfidious Man your Rival: but so successless were all those Stratagems, that they recoyl'd upon me, and what ever my Reason made use of to streng∣then your interest, my Heart in∣sensibly turn'd to the advantage of that ingrateful Man. Judge now what endeavours I've used to perswade my self to love you, and to how little purpose they have all been: 'Tis not Choice or Reason that governs the Heart, but being byass'd by it knows not what, it suf∣fers it self to be hurried away with an unaccountable Plea∣sure, to it knows not whither, or wherefore; and so strangely contradictory, is the Temper of
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>those who are in Love, that they fondly pursue their Tor∣mentors, and fly from those that would make 'em Happy. Oh! Cruelty, reply'd the Marquiss, interrupting her, is it not e∣nough to tell me you don't love me, but that I have a Rival whom you do love? Well Marquiss, said she, since 'tis so, let us try in some measure to alleviate the security of our Fates, you by endeavouring to wean your self from me, and I by studying to forget your Rival; since to love, and not be loved again, is certainly the greatest Plague upon Earth. For Heavens sake, Madam, re∣ply'd the Marquiss, teach me the Secret to forget you, 'tis all the Reward I ask, of what∣ever I have endur'd for you.
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>There is a never failing one, said she, which is never to see me more, and leave the rest to time. Never to see you more, Madam, reply'd the Marquiss, to spend Hours, Days, Months, nay Years without seeing you, or so much as ever hoping to see you more; Ah! what a Cruel Remedy you tell me of, will time, do you say, work the rest: Alas! how slow, and weak a Cure is Time, for so violent a Distemper.</P>
<P>Just as the Marquiss had said this, in came the Chevalier, and told him Supper was ready, and that the Company staid for him; though the Marquiss had a great deal more to say to Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> yet he was forc'd for that time to take his leave of her; which he did with
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>so much concern, that he cou'd scarce hide it from the Cheva∣lier: Wh n he was come to the place where they were to sup, he told those Persons whom he had engaged in the design a∣gainst Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> that he had restor'd her all the Money they had won of her, and turn'd it off with a Jest. Whereup∣on they gave him the Eight hundred <HI>Loüis d'ors,</HI> which the Count <HI>Charlois</HI> had given them.</P>
<P>Supper being upon the Table, and all the Company going to sit down, the Chevalier told 'em he had a matter of great importance to impart to 'em, of which it was highly necessary that every one should give his Opinion; that most Voices shou'd carry't: in order where∣unto
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>they shou'd chuse a Pre∣sident to count 'em, but not be∣gin the Debate till the Fruit was upon the Table, and in the mean time to consider well of the choice. Several Healths went round briskly, at last the Fruit being set on, the Cheva∣lier ask'd the Company if they had thought of a President, whereat they all, with one Voice, cry'd out they had made Choice of him. Immediately the Chevalier putting on as Grave and Magesterial a Look, as tho' he were President of the Council, open'd the Sessions in this manner, The defence of <HI>Bassett,</HI> Sirs, is to be the Subject of our present Debate, and we, being the chief Gamesters, whatever Rule we make herein, will be binding to o∣thers;
<PB N="88" REF="48"/>wherefore I desire every particular Person may give his advice in this weighty Affair deliberately, and without any prejudice. The first thing then to be consider'd of is, Whether 'tis most for our advantage to play at <HI>Bassett</HI> or not? And if to play, then secondly, What is to be done to avoid the Order which was this day Proclaimed to the contrary? Begin Mon∣sieur <HI>l' Abbè,</HI> said the Cheva∣lier, addressing himself to the <HI>Abbèe Olarion,</HI> you, whom the World has honour'd with the Glorious Title of Clerk of the <HI>Bassett</HI> Table: For my part, Sir, said the <HI>Abbè,</HI> I'm of Opinion the whole Company has reason to keep up <HI>Bassett,</HI> I've ever found it turn to good Account, and that the Bank must be the
<PB N="89" REF="48"/>only Winner at long run. 'Tis true that <HI>Bassett</HI> is an ill Game for the Setters, but we that are here present, have not so little Wit, as to do any thing but go in the Bank. 'Tis not, continu∣ed he smiling, but with great labour and pains that I have purchas'd that Glorious Title of Clerk of the <HI>Bassett</HI> Table; having crouppied day after day, to several Banks from two of the Clock after Dinner, till Eight at night, and so from Nine till One of the Clock the next Morning: Now I leave it to you to consider, how strong a Head a Man must have to undergo so great a Fateigue. The first Point, which is, whe∣ther 'tis most for our advantage to play at <HI>Bassett,</HI> being thus clear'd, I come now to the Se∣cond,
<PB N="90" REF="49"/><HI>viz.</HI> How we may play at it without any danger. This I must confess does a little gra∣vel me. There is no Pleasure in being made an Example. At first they will be very strict in putting the Law in Execution: in my judgment therefore, 'tis not safe to oppose them in the heat of their first Resolutions, but wart with patience till bet∣ter days, which cann't but be e're long, for <HI>Bassett</HI> is too too bewitching a Game, not to draw many of the Nobility and other Persons of Quality in to play at it, which will serve for a President to us; and this in short is what I think of the whole Matter.</P>
<P>Come thou Reverend Judge of <HI>Bassett,</HI> says the Chevalier, thou to whose infallible De∣cission
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>all difficult and con∣troversial Points of <HI>Bassett</HI> are submitted with an implicit Faith, let's hear what you say. I, said <HI>Chatigny,</HI> am of <HI>Abbè Olarion</HI>'s Opinion, but cou'd wish that in the mean time some Expedient might be found out of playing in some Noble Mens or Ambassadors Houses, and that sometimes we may have private <HI>Bassett</HI> in our Chambers to keep us in breath. What think you, Noble Cap∣tain, says the Chevalier, you, that as the Town will have it, have been so unfortunate at this Game. I, said the Captain, for my part, have been so pro∣vok'd with <HI>Bassett,</HI> that I wish him hang'd who first found it out. Before this Game came up, I and some others that un∣derstood
<PB N="92" REF="50"/>play pretty well, cou'd now and then pick up a little Money, and strip a well fea∣ther'd Bubble without any noise. But now <HI>Bassett</HI> has so engross'd the whole Trade, that there is nothing to be got for us poor Brothers of the Die. Now Monsieur Marquiss, said the Chevalier, addressing himself to the Marquiss of <HI>Ro∣ziers,</HI> 'tis your turn to speak. The Marquiss, rouzing himself as one just awak'd out of a dead sleep, stair'd upon the Cheva∣lier with such amazement, that the Chevalier saw plainly he knew not what they had been talking of. The Question, said the Chevalier, is whether or no it be for our advantage to play at <HI>Bassett?</HI> The Marquiss pau∣sing a while, Never, said he,
<PB N="93" REF="50"/>came any good of <HI>Bassett,</HI> since it came into <HI>France,</HI> therefore in my Judgment it ought to be banish'd for ever. But I must beg you will excuse me, and impute it to an odd whim I have, that I don't give you my Reasons for it. I'll do't for you, said <HI>Bautrin,</HI> taking up the Que∣stion. In Hell it self, said he, never was hatch'd so damnable a thing as <HI>Bassett.</HI> Thereupon the whole Company burst out into a great laughter, and cry'd he was not an Impartial Judge, having a Mortal peek to <HI>Bassett,</HI> for making him walk a foot. Think not, Sirs, reply'd he, that what I now say is out of madness for loosing my Coach and Hor∣ses; I am equally unlucky at all sorts of Games, and had I not lost 'em at <HI>Bassett,</HI> I had done it
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>at some other Game; so that the exception I have to <HI>Bassett,</HI> is not from what I have suffer'd but those general Extravagancies and mischiefs that attend it. At all other Games one has time to consider, and by reflecting upon his Losses and the Conse∣quence thereof, to leave off; but in this there is no being go∣vern'd by Reason, or any time to reflect; it runs away with so much quickness. One fancies to make the <HI>Paroli,</HI> or <HI>Sept et-le-va,</HI> which hapening to win, the success thereof draws him in to venture all he has, or can rap and rend, in hopes of the like good Fortune, till at last he loo∣ses all, and runs himself over head and ears in as short a time as I've been speaking. There's the Duce, says another, has lost
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>thrice already, 'tis strange if it shou'd loose the fourth time; so thinking to have found out a sure Card, in full confidence of winning, he sets all he has left upon it, which is fass'd, or loo∣ses the <HI>Sonica.</HI> Then how he storms, and rages, and borrow∣ing all the Money he can of every body, to follow the Duce on, he looses it (if he wou'd confess) four times the deal fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>Next day, without fail, he must seek out for Money to pay what he borrowed the Night before, and wherewithal to have his Revenge. Then the Cloaths, Jewels, and what ever Move∣ables he has, go to pawn, and so he has it, he cares not what Procuration or Interest he gives. With what fear, and concern, with
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>what impatience, and palpitati∣on of the Heart, does he watch the Cards as the Dealer is draw∣ing 'em, especially if he sees the corner of a Card which looks like his: Nay, I'll main∣tain <HI>Bassett</HI> does tire and wast the Spirits of those who play deep, more then any other Game, even <HI>Tennis</HI> it self; for which Reasons the Physicians do strictly forbid it to all those who are inclined to Consumpti∣ons. I have seen Women na∣turally of a pale Complexion, redden like Fire, and Men in the midst of the hardest Frosts swet as though they were in a Bagnio. <HI>Avalon,</HI> whom ye all know, in the height of his Fea∣ver, said, <HI>Va ten Pistols,</HI> a Mi∣nute after the <HI>Pay,</HI> then the double <HI>Pay,</HI> a <HI>Paroli</HI> of the
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>whole, continued he, in a great Agony, and on a sudden, raising his Voice, cry'd out, like one in Despair, Oh! unfortunate Crea∣ture that I am! to loose the <HI>So∣nica;</HI> insomuch that 'twas fear'd least those light-headed Fits shou'd turn to a perfect Fren∣zie; and but for his able Physi∣cian Dr. <HI>Pyard,</HI> who (knowing he had lost much at <HI>Bassett</HI>) advis'd him to send for some Gamesters to play by his Bed side, who came and lost to him some Money, which to that purpose his Mother had given 'em, the unfortunate Youth might have spent the rest of his Days in Bedlam.</P>
<P>These are the least of those many Evils that <HI>Bassett</HI> is the cause of. Young Gentlemen de∣sign'd for the Clergy, or the
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>Law, who, till <HI>Bassett</HI> came in, never knew what Gameing was, now lay aside the thoughts of their other Studies, and apply themselves wholly to the finding out some little Tricks and Ad∣vantages of the Game, or how to take up Money at a Scrive∣ners; who upon mighty advan∣tages supplies 'em with great summs. The Merchants, Perry∣wig makers, Taylors, Hatters, Mercers, or Lace-men, can't get a Farthing of Money from a <HI>Bassett</HI>-player; his Purse is intire∣ly devoted to the Bank, and to be put to no other use. Upon the whole mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, there are none but the Usurers, and Pawn∣brokers, but what loose by't. Let a Woman be never so dis∣creet, or virtuous, if she has once tasted of the powerful
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>Charms of <HI>Bassett,</HI> she can ne∣ver wean her self from it: if she wants Money, she must have it one way of other, and when she has no other Remedy, she borrows it of her Lover, who, after that, is so far from finding her Cruel, that she will gratifie him with many Favours, which she won't vouchsafe to the poor Man her Husband. That 'tis a certain Gain to those who keep the Bank, said the <HI>Abbè Olarion,</HI> is apparent from their having always won. Fie! re∣ply'd <HI>Bautrain,</HI> I never dealt in my Life, but I lost: and there was a Lady of <HI>Lisle,</HI> one of my particular Acquaintance, who in three Weeks time, by dealing at Six-penny <HI>Bassett,</HI> lost Three thousand <HI>Livers</HI> clear. You
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>shall have a Man, when he has been stuck at play, come to a small Bank, and set a Hundred or Sixscore <HI>Loüis d'ors</HI> upon a Card. The Bank upon a Pun∣ctillio of Honour stands it, the Setter winning it, makes the <HI>Paroli,</HI> and wins that too, so breaks the Bank, and at one Bout wins the whole Profit of three Month. 'Twas so that Madam <HI>Fontaigners</HI> Bank was broke.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Council is wise, and had not forbid <HI>Bassett</HI> but for the great Disorders it occasion'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> and for our common Good. They have the power in their Hands, and must not be disobey'd; the fatal Con∣sequences whereof, are in my Opinion too dangerous to be ventur'd. Scarce had <HI>Bautrain</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>speaking, when <HI>Ʋlisson</HI> ta∣king up the Question, 'Tis ob∣servable, Sirs, said he, that the most refined things in Morality, and the best in Nature, do, when used with excess, prove the worst and most dangerous. No Game that ever yet was in∣vented is comparable to <HI>Bassett,</HI> if play'd at with moderation and temper, nor any so pernici∣ous when us'd to excess. The design of Gaming, is to amuze the Mind with the various and extraordinary changes of For∣tune, just as <HI>Bassett</HI> does: for a Proof thereof you need but call to mind what Monsieur <HI>Bautrain</HI> said. A Setter, said he, looks upon himself to be upon the Point of being made a Beggar, his luck changes, a <HI>Sept-et-le-va</HI> comes and makes
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>him a Prince. Can any thing be more surprizing? Can any thing be more transporting? Have you occasion for Ten or Twelve Pistols to throw away upon any Divertisement, go to the <HI>Bassett</HI> Table, and as soon as ever you have won 'em, take your own time to come away; no body will press you to play on▪ no body will call after you, and you may go off with 'em without being counted a close sharping Gamester; a freedom that is the peculiar Excellency of this Game, and not allow'd of in any other. When at any time any of us are ill treated by our cruel Mistresses, we take advan∣tage of the Extremities to which <HI>Bassett</HI> reduces 'em, to subdue 'em to our Affections: Is not this a great relief to a wretched
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>Lover, who has spent Days and Nights in Sighs and Prayers, without obtaining the least Fa∣vour? <HI>Hazard, Quinque-nove,</HI> or <HI>Lansquenet,</HI> may produce as bad Effects, and are as quick despe∣rate Games as <HI>Bassett;</HI> besides, a <HI>Bassett</HI> player has great advan∣tage over all other Gamesters, he goes boldly into the Compa∣ny of Persons of the best Qua∣lity, and is well lookt upon: If he tallieès, he is much made of, and all the Servants of the House are particularly observant to him. 'Tis true, there is an Order to forbid it, the best way there∣fore is to address to the King, and represent to him that <HI>Bassett</HI> does not so much hurt at <HI>Paris,</HI> as his Majesty is inform'd, and so make an interest to have leave to keep a Bank: for my
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>part I'll make one willingly, and allow 80000 <HI>Livres</HI> yearly towards it for my own share. This, Gentlemen, is my Opi∣nion. <HI>Ʋlisson</HI> having made an end, the Chevalier underta∣king to speak to't, said, This appears to me, Sirs, to be a matter of great difficulty; for, that 'tis of mighty advantage to keep the Bank at <HI>Bassett,</HI> is so undeniable a Truth, that 'twere needless to use any Arguments to prove how prejudical this Or∣der to forbid <HI>Bassett</HI> has been to us sworn Keepers of the Bank. The Point now to be consider'd of is, how we may continue to play at it without running into any danger; a matter of so great difficulty, that the more and more I think on't, the further
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>I am from finding out which way it may be done: There is no pleasure I'm sure in being made an Example: to play pri∣vately and in a Room that is lock'd up, won't turn to account, or so much as pay for the Cards and Candles: on the other hand 'tis too hazardous to play in Noblemen's or Ambassadors Houses, as they did at <HI>Hoca,</HI> least an Officer shou'd come <HI>in∣cognito,</HI> and under pretence of playing, serve us, to our great comfort, with a Verbal Process for disobeying the Order. And how many poor indigent Fellows are there, who in hopes of ha∣ving the Fine, will turn Infor∣mers. The King and his Mini∣sters are fully satisfied this Game is prejudicial to the Publick, and therefore shou'd we offer to
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>Farm it at a Million a year, they wou'd never harken to the Pro∣posal. There is no one here but knows how they have forbid <HI>Hoca,</HI> under so severe Penalties, that tho' 'tis so very advantage∣ous a Game to those who keep the Bank, yet no body dares venture to do it; and so will it be with <HI>Bassett.</HI> Come then, continued he, let us Metamor∣phose <HI>Bassett</HI> into another Game, let it be much after the manner of <HI>Hoca;</HI> but by giving it ano∣ther Name, by playing it after a different way, and altering the chances, we may disguise it so that no body can possibly know it, and thereby evade the Penal∣ty of the Order. The first thing to be observ'd, is, that there be one who is to keep the Bank, and to have all the advantages
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>that he had at <HI>Bassett;</HI> only changing the Names. Those who formerly found out Games, have neither gam'd more, nor had their Talents lye better that way than ours do: Whereat the whole Company began to laugh, and approving of the Cheva∣liers Proposal, set themselves to invent some new Game. <HI>Abbè Olarion</HI> was for <HI>Lansquenet,</HI> as 'tis plaid at in <HI>Poland; Ʋlisson</HI> proposed <HI>Prieze;</HI> and the Cheva∣lier <HI>Nombre,</HI> insomuch that they were all divided upon which of these Games was best; but be∣ing now grown very late, they adjourned the Meeting till <HI>Tues∣day</HI> next, at the same hour and place; then and there to consi∣der further of those Matters, and the success of these new Games. Then every one in particular
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>returning Thanks to the Cheva∣lier, went away very well sa∣tisfied, and in good Humour, only the Marquiss of <HI>Roziers,</HI> who was fallen into a deep de∣spair, with what Madam <HI>Lan∣droze</HI> had said to him, and the difficulties he found he was like to undergo, upon the Resoluti∣ons he had taken to cure him∣self, if possible, of his Passion for her.</P>
