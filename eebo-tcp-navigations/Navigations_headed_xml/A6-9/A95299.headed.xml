<HEAD>A True Relation Of the Siege of BELGRADE, With the Taking it by Storm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>BElgrade</HI> is a City of Antient standing and great Fame, Situate on the Confluence of the Rivers <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Save,</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> and hath gone under divers Names; being at first, as far as can be ga∣thered from History, called, <HI>Taururum,</HI> or <HI>Tauranum;</HI> after that, <HI>Alba Graeca;</HI> by the <HI>Dutch</HI> accordingly, <HI>Greichs-Wessem∣burg;</HI> but by the <HI>French</HI> and Modern Latinists, <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and <HI>Belgradum;</HI> a Name given to this Important place for its Beautiful Situation, as being Hemm'd in upon the <HI>North</HI> with the <HI>Danube,</HI> on the <HI>East</HI> with the <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Save,</HI> and on the other parts strongly secured with Walls, Bulwarks, Ramports, and deep Ditches, anciently belonging to the De∣spots or Princes of <HI>Servia,</HI> tho lying on the very Frontiers of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and by many Attributed a City of that Kingdom,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>and may properly be divided into City and Suburbs; the Former having standing in it a very high and strong Castle, incompassed with double Walls, and what other Fortifications may contribute to its Defence. The Latter Replenished with many goodly Fabricks, and curious Buildings, inter∣mixed with pleasant Gardens, and has a prospect of the Countries round it, almost from <HI>Buda</HI> to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> and of such Importance was it in times past, That in <HI>Anno</HI> 1440. <HI>Amurath</HI> the Second Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> after he had wasted <HI>Hungary,</HI> and seized upon <HI>Servia</HI> (during the Discontents and Intestine Broils of those Countries) found nevertheless a check or stop to the progress of his Arms before this City; for having layn before it Seven Months, and lost in the several Attacques and Sallies of the Besieged 30000 Men; finding all hopes of taking it vain, he in a great Rage raised the Siege, and returned to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> so that the place had rest till <HI>Anno</HI> 1456, at what time <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Great being Em∣peror of the <HI>Turks,</HI> he upon the Death of <HI>George</HI> the Despot or Prince, seized upon <HI>Servia,</HI> which <HI>Amurath</HI> had permit∣ted to be held by that Prince as Tributary to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em∣peror; and passing on with a powerful Army, all the Cities and Towns but this opening their Gates, he laid Siege to it by Land and Water, and brought down a great many Vessels and Gallies of War upon the <HI>Danube;</HI> though at that time the great <HI>Hunniades</HI> having been Elected King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and not well brooking to have so powerful a Neighbour, set out from <HI>Buda</HI> with many armed Vessels, and falling sudden∣ly upon the <HI>Turks</HI> Naval Forces, Burn'd, Sunk, and took most of them; upon notice whereof, <HI>Mahomet</HI> in a great Rage gave order for a general Assault, Vowing not to spare, nor give Quarter to any, if the City of <HI>Belgrade</HI> fell into his Hands; and after Six hours obstinate Attempts, in which were lost 4000. Men, one whereof was <HI>Curaizis Bassa</HI> his Lieute∣nant in <HI>Europe,</HI> who was slain with a great Shot, he found
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/>himself constrained to sound the Retreat; and in the End, after many unsuccessful Assaults, finding his Army weakened by the loss of 40000 Men, he raised the Siege. From which time we find nothing Memorable relating to this City, till the Year 1520, at which time <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent suc∣ceeding <HI>Solyman</HI> his Father in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Throne, quarrel∣ing with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> (into whose Protection <HI>Belgrade</HI> was taken, consign'd by the Despot of <HI>Servia</HI> to King <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI> as best able to Maintain it, in consideration of Lands and Territories more remote) he laid Siege to it, being but weakly Garrison'd, and worse provided with Stores and Ammunition; and the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> by reason of Inte∣stine Divisions, being in no Capacity to raise an Army suffi∣cient to Relieve it, the Besieged found themselves (after a short Resistance) constrained to deliver up the place that had so long stood the Bulwark of Christendom, and has ever since been very advantageous to the Turks, by being made their chiefest Magazine or Store in the Western parts of their Empire; and although the Christians had many Consulta∣tions about Recovering it, yet soon after <HI>Buda</HI> being seized by the same <HI>Solyman,</HI> and other places of strong Importance, the <HI>Turks</HI> possessed it quietly till this present year 1688, when on the Sixth of <HI>September</HI> after, having sustained a Siege very Bloody and Resolute, it was taken by Storm by the Imperial Forces, under the Command of the Victorious Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> A True and Impartial Account of which take as followeth.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by reason of his Indisposition, not being capable to take the Field so early as the occasion of bu∣siness required, his Electoral Highness of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> offered his Service to the Emperor to lead the Army, which being accepted and approved, after the Forces were drawn out of their Winter Quarters and united, the Elector Arrived at
<PB N="4" REF="4"/><HI>Vienna;</HI> and there making a short stay, proceeded to his Command, when in a Council of War it was resolved, That seeing <HI>Buda</HI> was already reduced, and Heaven signally favour'd the Christian Arms, it was not convenient to omit the opportunity of Besieging so Important a place the Infidels held, <HI>viz. Belgrade;</HI> whereupon the Army had order to March towards the <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Save;</HI> so that on the Fourth of <HI>August</HI> New Stile, they set forward from <HI>Salankamen</HI> to <HI>Ze∣mon,</HI> where they stayed the next day; and the Sixth Encam∣ped at <HI>Semlyn;</HI> on the Seventh they came within Sight of the River, where it makes the considerable Islands of <HI>Zingari;</HI> when coming to the hither Bank, they perceived by reason of the Works the <HI>Turks</HI> had cast up in the Islands, where <HI>Teckely</HI> was said to be in Person, and on the further Shore, it was a matter of great difficulty, if not impossible, to pass there, as had been before designed, being much broader than it had been Represented; so that some time being spent a∣bout viewing, and further consulting what was to be done, another place was fixed upon, and accordingly (the next day) a great number of Boats that had been brought thither up∣on Wheels, were put into the Water, and the Regiment of <HI>Staremberg,</HI> the Electors Guards, and four Thousand Men, Detached out of other Bodies, were ordered to Waft over, under the Command of the Valiant, and truly Heroick, Count <HI>Serini,</HI> General of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces; when about Nine at Night, the Drums and Hautboys of the <HI>Janizaries</HI> were heard in the Camp, as seeming to approach the place of passage; but it so little discouraged the Imperialists, that about Eleven at Night, the Foot were Embarqued, and the Elector directed that 500 Men, under the Command of a Lieutenant Colonel, should Land first to observe the place; but scarce were they in the Middle of the River, but about 300 <HI>Turks</HI> appeared on the further Shore, and discharged a Volley of Shot, but without doing any dammage to the Chri∣stians;
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/>who, after this discharge, hastened to Land under the favour of the Cannon Planted to Annoy the Enemy; so that thereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> quitted their Post; where the Land∣ing place and ground was found as well as could reasonably be wished, being very Commodious, by reason about four paces from the Bank of the River were almost Inaccessible, by reason of the Bushes and Woody places; so that the Boats left those they carried over in Security, and returned; when about Four in the Morning, 3000 were got over, covering and Intrenching themselves, to prevent any Attempt or Sur∣prize the Evening might make upon them, who now ap∣proached in considerable Numbers; and whilst the Foot thus continued to pass over in Boats, the Bridge was laid for the Horse; however, before it could be Finished, 6000 of the Enemies Foot, and some Horse, Attacqued the Christians on the further Shoar, on the Right and the Left; but, after se∣veral Assaults, were Repulsed with a considerable Loss; the Christians losing a Major of the Regiment of <HI>Staremberg,</HI> with divers Granadeers that were too far advanced; when about Eleven of the Clock, 10000 Men had effectually pas∣sed the River; and then the Enemy appeared again with a greater force, within Musquet-shot, but made no farther at∣tempt; and soon after, a <HI>Hungarian</HI> Dissenter, Informed the General, That the Enemy the Night following, intended to make an Attacque with their whole Power; but about Five in the Evening (the Bridge being entirely finished) a Regi∣ment of Dragoons passed it, and after them, the Foot that remained, and about Midnight, the rest of the Horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that on the Ninth of <HI>August,</HI> the whole Army, with the Artillery and Baggage, Encamped on the further Shore, with∣in four Leagues of <HI>Belgrade;</HI> where his Electoral Highness was Informed, That there was a Garrison of 12000 <HI>Turks,</HI> and 3000 <HI>Tartars</HI> in the City, but without any certainty; and that <HI>Yeghen Bassa</HI> lay Entrenched with the rest of the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/><HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, between the <HI>Save</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> to cover the place; but being nothing dismayed at this Report, his Electoral Highness Commanded the Army on the Tenth to March towards the City, in order to Battle, resolving to Attacque the Enemy in their Camp; when, contrary to ex∣pectation, they found it abandoned, and the Suburbs or lower Town on Fire, the <HI>Turks</HI> that Inhabited it, having saved themselves in the Boats belonging to the City; yet four of them were taken with a considerable Booty, and the <HI>Hussars</HI> being sent out in a flying Party after the Retreating Enemy, took much of their Baggage, and some Thousands of great and small Cattle; when upon the near approach of the Army, 4000 <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Rascians,</HI> with their Wives and Children, came to meet them, and to Implore his Electoral Highnesses Protection, which they obtained; strict Orders being given throughout the Camp, that none under great Penalties and Punishment, should presume to disturb or molest them; how∣ever, the Soldiers having quenched the Fire, after it had Burnt several hundred Houses, found a considerable Booty the <HI>Turks</HI> in their hast and confusion had left behind them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperialists</HI> thus uncontrouled approaching the Walls of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> Scouts were sent out to learn the Motion and Intent of the Enemy, who returned with an Account, That <HI>Yeghen</HI> Bassa, the Serasquier of <HI>Hungary,</HI> together with <HI>Yeck∣ley,</HI> was retired to <HI>Sendrovia,</HI> about Eight Leagues further, with 20000 Men under his Command: And upon further Inquiry, it was confidently reported, That no more than 4000 Men were left in the Castle or upper Fortress, under the Command of a Governor, who had lately been a common Soldier: And further, That <HI>Yeghen</HI> would have Fought the Army, but was disswaded from it by the Bassa of <HI>Erla</HI> or <HI>Agria,</HI> and some other Principal Officers; Three of which (in a great Fury) he cut in pieces with his own hand, and caused the Bassa of <HI>Agria</HI> to be Strangled in his
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y"/>presence; the former Bassa, Governour of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> making his Escape, to avoid his Fury; as also did <HI>Hassan</HI> Bassa, his Competitor.</P>
<P>Upon the day of Arrival before the place, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> caused the Trenches to be opened against the Upper Town and Castle, and dispatched the Sieur <HI>Dietrick,</HI> Captain of Horse, and Adjutant to General <HI>Caprara,</HI> with Letters to <HI>Vienna,</HI> giving the Emperor an account of the Success, and lodged himself in the Pleasure-House, built without the Town, for the Reception of the Deposed <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> when he came to View the Muster of his Army that (under the Leading of <HI>Cara Mustapha</HI> the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI>) Besieged <HI>Vienna, Anno</HI> 1683. where he had News, that the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> after Three hours obstinate Fight, had overthrown the Bassa of <HI>Bosna</HI>'s Army, composed of between 12 and 14000 Men, posted to hinder his Passage over the River <HI>Ʋna,</HI> Killing Four Thousand on the Place; upon which, <HI>Constan∣towitza</HI> had Surrendred, a Place of considerable Importance on that side.</P>
<P>Things being at this pass, Preparations were made (with much caution and diligence) to Attack the Castle; the Management or Conduct of which, was left to Count <HI>Serini,</HI> Lieutenant General to His Electoral Highness, the Walls whereof the Elector had Viewed, and given Orders, where he perceived it most advantageous for the Attacks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And although the <HI>Turks</HI> Sallyed at the same time, yet were they beaten back, with the loss of but One Man on the part of the <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, being the Twelfth, in the Evening the Troops' began to Approach the Castle, and to take their Posts; to hinder which, the Enemy made a Vigorous Sally, so that the Skirmish continued Three or Four hours, but at last they were Repulsed; and in this Action Eighty of the <HI>Christians</HI> were Killed and Wounded, the <HI>Turks</HI> losing
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>a greater Number: And so successful it proved, that the for∣mer secured, under the favour of this Action, their Posts, and opened the Frenches within Musquet-shot of the Walls, and began to work on Two Batteries.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth in the Morning, the Besieged made ano∣ther Sally in a greater Body than the former, breaking on up∣on the Besiegers, and came to Handy-blows, in which Dis∣pute Count <HI>Rabntine,</HI> General of the Battalia, was shot in the Arm, Count <HI>Tassis,</HI> Serjeant Major of the Regiment of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in the Body, and several other private Soldiers were Killed and Wounded; but the Besiegers being presently re∣inforced, the Besieged were beaten back, many of them being Slain and Wounded, of which 500 were left behind Dead, and two taken Prisoners; who Reported, That there were Ten Thousand Persons in the Garrison, but many of them Women and Children, which was confirmed by a Christian Slave, who had been there since the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and now made his escape to the Army; when the same day, News came, That <HI>Yeghen Bassa</HI> had set the Famous City of <HI>Seman∣dra</HI> on Fire, which was about seven Leagues from the Camp, and carried the Inhabitants to <HI>Nissa,</HI> continuing his Retreat in great disorder towards <HI>Sofia.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourteenth of <HI>August</HI> the Enemies Cannon Played suriously, and they threw a great many Granado's and Bombs, but did no considerable Execution; and after that, made ano∣ther Sally, though with no better success than the former; and the same day a Detachment of the Garrison of <HI>Temes∣ware</HI> got by the help of Boats into the Castle, on that part that stands to the River <HI>Danube,</HI> though the number was not considerable.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth of <HI>August,</HI> the Besieged had finished a Bat∣tery of three Mortars, and shot a great many Carcasses and Bombs into the place, doing considerable Execution; and the Elector ordered, that a Lieutenant General, a Serjeant-Major,
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>and Two Colonels, with 800 Horse, and 3000 Foot should Nightly Guard the Trenches; where, the bet∣ter to Incourage the Workmen, His Electoral Highness con∣tinued frequently till One or Two in the Morning.</P>
<P>On the Sixteenth, the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> arrived, and made his Entrance into the Camp with a numerous Train, and splendid Equipage, having with him above 500 Men on Horse-back, including his Guards, 40 lead Horses, 24 Mules, and 25 Waggons with Baggage, and a Coach of State drawn by Six Horses, and followed by many other Coaches, and a great many Servants in Liveries; and upon his ap∣proach, was met by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> accompanied by the Chief Officers, about a Mile from the Camp, and thence conducted to the Head Quarters, where they Dined together, and afterward went to visit the Trenches, when in the mean time, his Tents to the number of 104, some of them very Rich, were pitched between the Electors Quarters, and that of General <HI>Caprara;</HI> and in the Even∣ing the Besieged made a Sally with a greater Body than formerly, but found the Trenches so strongly Guarded, that they were obliged to Retreat with a considerable loss.</P>
<P>On the Seventeenth, by break of day, the Besiegers be∣gan to Batter the Walls of the Castle with Six Pieces of Ca∣non, and understood by a Deserter, that the Enemy were hard at work in their Mines; and in the Evening, General <HI>Caprara,</HI> being with his Electoral Highness in the Trenches, to give necessary directions, and encourage those that were working, a Musquet-shot passed through his Hat and Peruke, without doing him any further damage.</P>
<P>On the Eighteenth the Enemies Cannon and Small-shot played very smartly, so that Count <HI>Gallenfells,</HI> a Colonel of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> being in the Trenches, received a Wound in the Body with a Musquet-shot, and Lieutenant Colonel Count <HI>Lambert,</HI> another in the Head, and the young Count <HI>De
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>Traun</HI> had his Arm shot off, and under the favour of their Canon the Enemy Sallyed, but were soon beaten back.</P>
<P>On the Nineteenth, the Trenches were carried on with great diligence, insomuch that the Workmen run them within ten paces of the Ditch, though not without some considerable opposition, and great loss of Men, but not any of Note; so that now they began to raise two new Batteries, and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Count <HI>Serini,</HI> and General <HI>Ca∣prara,</HI> continuing all Night in the Trenches, the better to encourage so important a Work.</P>
<P>On the Twentieth, the Besiegers possessed themselves of a <HI>Mosque</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Church, on the brink of the Ditch, which the Besieged upon their approach abandoned, and hastened to the Castle with great precipitation; how∣ever, one less nimble than the rest was taken, who declared upon Examination, there were 5000 <HI>Janizaries</HI> in the Town and Castle, and that the Commanding Bassa encouraged the Garrison with assurance of Relief, promising at the same time, not to suffer things to come to Extremity, though no great stress was laid upon this Report; so that the Canon and Bombs continued to play furiously on both sides, where by one of the Shells the Prince <HI>D'Comercy</HI> received a Con∣tusion or Bruise on the Arm, and the Sieur <HI>Claudio Martelli,</HI> Adjutant General to the Army, a Wound in the Head; and although many others of lesser Note were Wounded, yet but one Man was killed.</P>
<P>On the One and Twentieth, two Parallel Lines were drawn on the Right and the Left, to compass a greater space of Ground, as well on the side of the Castle, as the Town, and two Redoubts made to support the Heads of them, which were performed in spite of the opposition the Enemy made, doing all they could with their Canon and Bombs, to en∣damage the Workmen, and hinder the Proceedings.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<P>On the Twenty Second, the Besiegers having per∣fected the Works, the great Canon and Mortars Arrived from <HI>Buda;</HI> upon which, Orders were given to Batter the Castle from Two Batteries, one of Fourteen Pieces, and the other of Twelve: And a Deserter that came into the Camp, reported, <HI>That the Bassa had caused a considerable Officer to be Hanged, on the Fifteenth, for offering to speak of a Sur∣render: And that he gave, for their better Incouragement, a Duccate to every Man that would venture to make a Sally:</HI> And about this Time other Scouts that had been sent out to observe the Motion of <HI>Yeghen Bassa,</HI> returned, having been as far as <HI>Sendrovia,</HI> and made their Report, that the Castle and Town were quite destroyed by Fire, but the Walls are standing; and that the <HI>Turks</HI> left Twenty Pieces of Canon behind them for hast, or want of conveniency to carry them off. They likewise brought with them a <HI>Christian,</HI> who had made his Escape out of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, confirming, That <HI>Yeghen</HI> Bassa was retired to <HI>Nissa,</HI> about Twenty Leagues from <HI>Belgrade,</HI> burning the Country, and carrying the People along with him; so that care was taken to fetch off the Canon left at <HI>Seudrovia;</HI> And then it was Rumoured, that a great many Families of <HI>Rascians</HI> had offered to Re-edifie and Inhabit that Ancient City, if they might be Protected by an Imperial Garison.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Third, the Besiegers batter'd the Castle very suriously, which is Built after the Ancient way of For∣tifying, with Towers, Battlements, Double-Walls, and con∣siderable Ditches; however, the Canon made divers Breaches, and beat down part of the Fortifications; and although the Besieged Sallyed, with an Intent to Attack the Redoubts, they were beaten in again, leaving a consi∣derable number of their Party dead behind them. And about this Time it was further confirmed, that the Prince of
<PB N="12" REF="8"/><HI>Baden</HI> had routed the Bassa of <HI>Bosna,</HI> and Killed 3000 Men. Moreover, <HI>Debitza, Jessuewitz,</HI> and <HI>Gradiska</HI> being first set on Fire, were Abandoned by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were retired towards <HI>Banyalucca,</HI> whither the <HI>Imperialists</HI> follow'd them: As also that General <HI>Veterani</HI> had Taken <HI>Carausebes,</HI> and the strong Castle of <HI>Salancar:</HI> And now the Canon Playing suriously from the Batteries; the Engineers (though they were raised as high as they could bare) found some Ob∣struction, by reason of the Ruinous Houses that had been consumed by the Fire, or shatter'd by the force of the Bombs and Canon; whereupon the Miners received Or∣ders to Overthrow them: in which they were so Expedi∣tious and successful, that the Besieged were laid more open to the force of Twenty Six Pieces of Canon, though the Besieged were not Idle but made very Vigorous Sallies, as long as they could, Playing their Canon, Bombs, and small Shot without Intermission; so that many were Killed on both sides, and some Wounded; amongst the latter was Count <HI>D' Ligneville,</HI> Collonel of Foot, and Adjutant Gene∣ral, wounded by a Shot in the Trenches, whither he was come to give necessary Orders; and although he was car∣ried off, yet soon after he Died of the Wound.</P>
<P>These being the Actions passing the Twenty Third and Twenty Fourth, and the heavy Canon being all mounted on the Batteries; whilst they were Thundring against the Walls, a Letter was brought and Presented to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> from <HI>Osman</HI> Bassa of <HI>Aleppo;</HI> the Tenure of which, together with His Electoral Highnesses Answer, take as followeth:</P>

<P>To this Letter, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> after some con∣sulting the Matter in Council, with the Chief Officers of the Army, returned the following Answer:</P>

<P><HI>WE have Received the Letter You sent Ʋs from the Camp near</HI> Nissa, <HI>wherein You give Ʋs to understand, That an Ambassador, by Name</HI> Sulsicar Effendi, <HI>and the first</HI> Drugger-man, <HI>have Orders from your Emperor to come to Our Army; Now, although we being Inclin'd to Military Actions, might well refuse their coming hither; or which, none could take amiss, in the present Juncture of Affairs, might put it off till another time, since We do judge their Proposals will little agree with Our present Intentions; yet, being moved by a Chri∣stian Compassion, We do grant that They may come to Our Ar∣my, and We will favourably Hear what Your Emperor has Commanded them to Propose unto Ʋs; for which purpose, We have Commanded that a Passport be prepared for Their secu∣rity, and delivered to the Person that brought Ʋs your Letter: We have likewise given Order to the Commandant of</HI> Semen∣dria, <HI>that in the manner directed him, and with a sufficient number of Troops, he Conduct them safely to Our Army, upon which they may firmly Rely.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon the return of this Answer to the Bassa of <HI>Aleppo</HI>'s Letter, General <HI>Caraffa</HI> received Orders to go to <HI>Titul,</HI> to meet the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ambassadors, and to hear what they had to Propose; and in the mean while the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> sent to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to acquaint the Emperor that a <HI>Chiaux</HI> was
<PB N="15" REF="9" MS="y"/>Arrived in the Camp, and what he had done in Answer to the Letter received, desiring further Advice on this oc∣casion; upon which, he received Directions to suffer the Ambassadors to pass on with their Train: So that the <HI>Chiaux</HI> was sent back with a Pass-port for the Ambassadors, under the Convoy of Twenty Horse: And thereupon the Count <HI>de Lodron</HI> Marched with a Regiment of <HI>Croats,</HI> to strengthen the Garrison a little before put into <HI>Semandria,</HI> least the <HI>Turks</HI> should return, upon second Thoughts, and Repossess it.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Fifth, the great Canon being Arrived, and the Batteries were Intirely fixed, the Besiegers posses∣sed themselves under the favour of them of another <HI>Mosque,</HI> very advantageously Scituate, to shelter them in the ad∣vancing their Works, whilst the Miners Lodged themselves at the Foot of the Wall, and made Lodgments for their Powder.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Sixth, the Batteries against the Castle Playing furiously, beat down the Top of the Round-Tower, which fell into the Ditch, doing damage to the Battlements, and other Works in its Fall; and the better to forward this good Success, Fifteen Mortars were placed most advanta∣geously on the sides of the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ries that were the most ad∣vanced, in order to cast Bomb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the Castle and Town.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Seventh the Canon and Mortars Play'd very furiously, by whose continual Thundering, a consi∣derable Breach was made in the Wall, at what Time the Besieged sprung a Mine near the <HI>Mosque,</HI> of which the Besiegers made themselves the last Masters; which, though it did not Blow up, yet rendered it useless, and Wounded di∣vers Men that were in and near it.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Eighth, The Besieged sprung another Mine, designing thereby to Ruine the main Advance Bat∣tery of the Besiegers; but Blowing up short, it only shook
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>it, without any Demolishment; yet the Thunder-crack was so great, that it occasioned a considerable Disorder, and was Increased by one of the Besieged's Bombs, setting Fire to several Quintals of Powder, which blew up Seven or Eight Men that were on the Battery; which the Be∣sieged perceiving, made a Sally with about an Hundred Men, coming on the Right and Left of the Head of the Trenches, but found the Guards there in so good a Posture, that being warmly received (after some Dispute) they were beaten back, with the loss of Twelve of their Men, who were Killed at the first Volley of Shot discharged upon them: And this day Two <HI>Christians</HI> made their Escape out of the Place, to the Camp; and declared, That the Garrison was between Three and Four Thousand strong, that they were very diligent in Mining, to meet the Approaches of the Besiegers; and that the Governor, whose Name was <HI>Ibraim,</HI> assured them there was a Powerful Army coming to their Relief; Incouraging them, in the Expectation thereof, to make a resolute Defence.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Ninth, His Electoral Highness sent a Captain, with an Interpreter, to Summon the Besieged to a Surrender of the Town and Castle, seeing they could have no hopes, or the least expectation of Succour; which the Governor so highly resent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that (contrary to the Rules or Articles of War) he caused the Interpreter, who was a <HI>Grecian,</HI> to be Hanged, and Imprisoned the Captain. The Night following, the Besiegers Engineers set Fire to the Besieged's Palisado's, and thereupon a Detachment of not Men were ordered to advance, and make a Lodgment in the Ditch; but the Besieged, by the light of this Fire, so well directed and levelled their Shot, that 100 of the Party were Killed, a great many Wounded, and the rest obliged to retire, notwithstanding the Fire so ruined the Palisado's, that being within the reach of the Shot from the Trenches, the Besieged could not Repair them.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="10" MS="y"/>
<P>On the Thirtieth, The Fury of the Canon had very much enlarged the Breach; but however, it was not judged open enough for an Assault, and the Miners having run a Mine to the Corner of one of the largest Towers on the Wall, and heightning Themselves in expectation of the great use they might make of it, found themselves disappointed by a Countermine made against them by the Besieged, into which they unadvisedly fell, and were so annoyed with Granado's and combustible Matter that was Fired, to put a stop to their Progress, that to avoid the danger and the stench, they found themselves constrained to retire towards the opening of their own Mine, with some Loss: And the same day the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> was Wounded in the Thigh with a Musquet∣shot; and some time before, Major General <HI>Aspremont,</HI> with the fall of an Old Wall, and several others of lesser Note.</P>
<P>On the Thirty First, The Canon continued to Play on both Sides very furiously, with very good Effect on the part of the Besiegers; nor were the Besieged Idle, but proceeded with great Endeavours, and indefatigable Industry, with Earth, Faggots, and other Materials to make up the Breaches, and to Intrench themselves within them; however, the Be∣siegers so far Advanced, that they, in a manner, formed their Gallery, and appeared every where desirous to give the Assault, though about this time (without any just Ground) the Camp was Alarumed by the Country People, through a Report spread abroad, that there were Powerful Armies of <HI>Turks</HI> approaching; but whilst every Body was wondring from whence they should come, all that could be gathered was, that <HI>Teckley,</HI> who with small Parties was wandring about the Neighbourhood of <HI>Semendria,</HI> had bribed some, and deceived others into this Opinion; whereupon a Body of Horse was sent out in search of him; and the Scouts that came in brought a certain account, that <HI>Osman Teghen</HI> re∣mained at <HI>Nissa</HI> with his Horse, most of his Infantry having,
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>upon Discontents, want of Pay, and for other Reasons, de∣serted him; however, he continued to destroy all the For∣rage, and Burn the Towns for above Forty Miles in circum∣ference; yet, so great was the Plenty in the Imperial Camp, that a Fat-Oxe might be bought for a Duccate; and even at <HI>Vienna</HI> it self Provisions could not be Purchased at so cheap a Rate; one main Reason for it being the Three Bridges, that gave free Forrage and Communication on all sides, <HI>viz.</HI> One over the <HI>Save,</HI> Another over the <HI>Thysse,</HI> and a Third over the <HI>Danube,</HI> a little above <HI>Belgrade:</HI> And now, upon the News of the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI>'s Arrival at <HI>Peter Wa∣radine,</HI> His Electoral Highness sent thither to Complement him upon His coming into <HI>Hungary,</HI> since the Recovery of His late Indisposition.</P>
<P>On the First of <HI>September,</HI> the Canon from Six Batteries and Thirty Two Mortars, Played upon the Castle, widen∣ing the Breach, and doing considerable Execution; under the favour of which, the Besiegers began to fill up the Ditch, preparing several Mines to be useful towards a ge∣neral Assault: And Major General <HI>Dunwalt</HI> Marched out with Twelve Regiments of Horse towards <HI>Semendria,</HI> to seize upon, and secure such part of the Country as remained Unharrased, or not Destroyed by the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>On the Second, the Canon ruined the Besieged's Batteries, and the Defences they had made within the Breaches, by way of Reintrenchments, so that the Breach was conceived wide enough to Enter; yet the Besieged continued Obsti∣nate, refusing to return any Answer to the Summons sent them, on the Twenty Ninth of <HI>August;</HI> and seemed rather to expect the last Extremity, than think of terms of Agree∣ment by way of Capitulation, and timely Surrender; whereupon it was concluded, that the Town and Castle be∣ing made Saultable, no time should be lost in carrying it on with the utmost Courage and Vigour; so that the Third,
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>Fourth, and Fifth days being spent in Battering the yet remaining Works, Springing some Mines, and filling the Ditch to facilitate the Ascent, and giving necessary Orders as to what was intended in the Execution, without any great disturbance from the Besieged, though several were Killed and Wounded.</P>
<P>On the Sixth, the day appointed for the General Assault, (incouraged by their Commanders) after some Dispute, in which many were Killed and Wounded, the Soldiers mounted the Breach, where the Besieged, with great Reso∣lution, made an Obstinate Resistance, and defended it with so much Vigour, (Fighting like Men in Despair, for the last Refuge and defence of their Lives) that the Besiegers were twice beaten off: But the Elector himself, not sparing his Person in places of Eminent danger, being at hand, and animating the Officers and Soldiers upon the Third Assault, the Besieged finding all their Effort and Opposition vain, began to lose Courage, and, by degrees, to Retire; so that perceiving the Breach, and all their Retrenchments, on that part, intirely won, they abandoned the Fight, and fled to the Castle, as the place of their last Retreat; but the Be∣siegers now entring like a Torrent, pressing on with great Fury, entered pell-mell with them, putting all (in the first heat, without distinction of Age and Sex) to the Sword, nor could the Riches they offered prevail to the saving their Lives; which the Bassa perceiving, and find∣ing no hopes of making any long Resistance, he caused Three Hundred Christian Slaves to be brought, Chained together, which he placed before the retiring <HI>Turks,</HI> in such manner as they must have received the Shot made at the Enemy; in compassion to whom, the Soldiers stopped in the heat of Blood, and the Elector Commanded that Quar∣ter should be given; whereupon, about Five Hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> that (under the favour of this Stratagem) had saved
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>themselves, together with the Bassa Governor, and Two other Bassa's, submitted, and were made Prisoners of War, with many that were not in Arms; when as the Bassa Go∣vernor being brought to the Presence of the Elector of <HI>Ba∣varia,</HI> he fell prostrate before him, and made it his earnest Request, that he might not be made a Prisoner; (the <HI>Hun∣garians,</HI> and <HI>Rascians,</HI> returning him extraordinary Thanks for saving their Lives); to which humble Request, His Electoral Highness, replyed, <HI>That he should experience, the Christians use their Prisoners better than the Turks do;</HI> adding withal, That he should be immediately sent to the Emperor, at which he seemed extreamly pleased; and thereupon General <HI>Car∣raffa,</HI> who had it in charge to carry the Proposals made by the <HI>Turks,</HI> was Commanded to take charge of him, and Guard him to <HI>Newstadt.</HI></P>
<P>The greatest Prizes that were gained in the Sack of this Important Place, fell to the share of the <HI>Christian</HI> Slaves, who knew where their Masters had hid their Treasure, during the Siege; of which, there were found about Six Hundred, the greater part of them <HI>Austrians,</HI> who had at sumdry times been taken by <HI>Turkish</HI> Parties, and brought or Sold to the <HI>Turks,</HI> Inhabitants of the City, and now found their deli∣very from a long and cruel Bondage, by the prevailing Arms of their fellow Christians: here were found likewise Seventy Pieces of Canon, great and small; and although the Town and Castle was extreamly defaced by Fire, yet the Houses be∣ing many of them ruinous before, and the greater part built with Timber, will, upon their Rebuilding, render them more Famous; which will not long be wanting, by reason of its Commodious Scituation for Trade, and confluence of People that are soon expected thither from their Neigh∣bouring Parts.</P>
<P>This Action lasted Four hours, with much Blood-shed and Slaughter on both Sides, most of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Garrison
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>Soldiers being Killed, a Thousand dead Bodies being after∣ward found, and thrown into the River, and Three Thousand made Prisoners; nor was the number of the <HI>Christians</HI> slain in the Assault, inconsiderable, among whom, of more par∣ticular Note (in relation to their Characters and Quality) fell Lieutenant General Count <HI>D' Schariffenburg;</HI> the Count <HI>Emanuel d' Frustemburg,</HI> Colonel of Foot; and the Young Count <HI>d'Staremberg;</HI> so unto the Governor of <HI>Vienna,</HI> many likewise of Note were Wounded, amongst whom, the E∣lector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> himself slightly in the Cheek, as he exposed his Person in places of danger, to Incourage the Assailants, and give necessary Orders.</P>
<P>And thus in the space of Twenty Two days the Famous City of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> fell into the Hands of the <HI>Christians,</HI> and by its Reduction, opened them a way into all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions that are considerable in <HI>Europe;</HI> there being no Place of great Importance between it and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the Metropolis of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which (if the In∣testine Commotions of the <HI>Christian</HI> Princes hinder not) may undoubtedly, in a short time, follow the Fortune of this strong City; as also their other places got, and unjustly detained from the <HI>European</HI> Christians, to the shaking, if not the Overthrow of that Bloody Empire, which (for upward of Two Hundred Years) has been so terrible to Christendom.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Three</HI> B<HI>'s, of which Two are already won,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Will Crown the Glory of the Work begun.</HI></L>
<L>Buda, Belgrade, Bizantum <HI>once obtain'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The rest will be but sport, and quickly gain'd.</HI></L></Q>

<P><HI>SInce the Rendition of this Important Place, more particular News came of the Defeat of the Bassa of</HI> Bosnia, <HI>which, for the extraordinary and unexpected success of the Christians, I conceived might be acceptable, and not improper to be added: Prince</HI> Lovis <HI>of</HI> Baden <HI>on the Fourth of</HI> Septemb. <HI>having notice that four or five Thousand</HI> Turks <HI>were Encamped about Six Miles from</HI> Brod, <HI>he Marched to Encounter them with</HI> 3000 <HI>Horse and Dragoons, Marching with great diligence all Night, but in the Morning (to his no small Surprize) he found himself greatly mis-inform'das to the Number, which amounted to Fifteen Thousand Horse and Foot; under the Command of the Bassa: however, calling the Officers about him, he told them, it was to no purpose to think of Retreating, as being too late, by reason of their too far Engagement amongst the Enemy, but that they must now fight for their Lives and Victory, which was chearfully consented to; but before they had well put themselves into a Posture to Fight, the</HI> Turks <HI>had surrounded them, and vigorously charged four or five times, which was sustained with so much Bravery, and such vi∣gorous Returns, that the Enemies Horse perceiving
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>themselves over-set, fell first into Disorder, and then to open Flight, leaving the Foot to shift for themselves, whose Ranks being forced (by the Im∣perial Horse breaking in upon them) they were mi∣serably Beaten down and Slain, those that Fled, cry∣ing out for Quarter; so the Prince becoming entire∣ly Master of the Field,</HI> 5000 <HI>of the</HI> Turks <HI>were found kill'd,</HI> 2000 <HI>taken Prisoners,</HI> 36 <HI>Colours taken, and all the Baggage; for which extraordi∣nary Success, (in which the hand of God so sig∣nally appear'd) Thanks were sent up to Heaven in most of the Capital Cities of the Empire. We are further assured, that of the</HI> 1000 <HI>Boats that fled from</HI> Belgrade, <HI>before and after it was Invested, not above</HI> 200 <HI>of them Arrived in places of Safety, the rest being either Stranded, bedded in the Mudd for want of Water, or Deserted by such as were in them, out of a fear they were Pursued, and by that means most of the Deserters with their Baggage fell into the hands of the Country people, or such parties as were abroad to scowre the Coast, and ga∣ther the Spoil,</HI></P>
