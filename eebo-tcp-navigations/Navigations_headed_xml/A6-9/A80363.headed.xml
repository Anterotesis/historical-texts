<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS Humbly Offer'd To the Honourable <HI>HOUSE of COMMONS,</HI> BY THE Planters, and Others, trading to our <HI>British</HI> Plantations, in Relation to the <HI>African</HI> Company's Petition, now before this Honourable HOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT it being of so great Importance to this Nation to encourage and support the Plantations, it will be of absolute Necessity to have them plentifully supply'd with Negroes, by whose Labour all the Commo∣dities of those Countries are produc'd; which Production is all clear Gains to this Nation, and better than the Mines of Gold and Silver are to the <HI>Spa∣niards;</HI> which can never be throughly done otherwise, than by a free open Trade, with∣out being confin'd to the narrow Compass of a few People, in a small Joint-Stock.</P>
<P>There is not a Negro but produceth as much Commodity, either Sugar, Indigo, Tobacco, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will load one Tun of Shipping; the Increase of which Produce will also largely increase the Consumption of the Woollen, and other <HI>British</HI> Manu∣factures, and augment the Revenues of the Crown.</P>
<P>A great Quantity of the Product of our Plantation-Commodities will enable the <HI>British</HI> Merchants to make large Exportations to foreign Markets, and put them into a Capacity to under-sell all other Nations, that vie with us in the same Com∣modities; which will not only discourage their Plantations, but greatly encourage our own.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>African</HI> Company do set forth in their Petition, That by their Charge in maintaining their Forts and Castles, in securing that Trade on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> the Western Plantations have been furnished with Negroes; we the Planters do say, That we have paid a Duty of 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for the same, and that had it not been more for the Separate Traders than the <HI>African</HI> Company, since the opening of the said Trade by the late Act of Parliament, the Plantations had been but poor∣ly served; for by Experience, we have found much greater Numbers of Negroes brought to our Plantations, than ever were during the time of the said <HI>African</HI> Company's having that Trade in their own Hands, exclusive of all others.</P>
<P>Therefore since the Plantations have receiv'd a more visible Advantage from the <HI>African</HI> Trade, by having greater Quantities of Negroes brought among them by the Separate Traders, since the said Trade has been laid open, than ever were be∣fore: And as the Product of our Islands are largely increas'd thereby, we are hum∣bly of Opinion, that the Interest of the Plantations is of infinitely greater Concern to be preserved, than any Company with a Joint-Stock can pretend to.</P>
<P REND="italic">Wherefore we hope, That the Honourable <HI>House of Commons</HI> will free us from the heavy Burden of the Duty of <HI>10 per Cent.</HI> which we conceive must be advanced on the Price of Negroes; and that the said <HI>African</HI> Trade may be continu'd free and open to all People that desire to trade thither, under such Regulations as the Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> or as shall be thought fit.</P>
