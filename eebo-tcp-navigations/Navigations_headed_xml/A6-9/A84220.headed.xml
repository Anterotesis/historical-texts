<HEAD>TWO BLOUDY FIGHTS AT SEA,</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IT was upon the seventeenth of <HI>May</HI></L>
<L>that ship-<HI>Fortune</HI> began with <HI>French</HI> to her play,</L>
<L>A gallant fight against them did performe</L>
<L>but the second Capt. and men adorne.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho the matter is great</HI></L>
<L><HI>now Sea-men fight,</HI></L>
<L><HI>for their Birth-Right</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Upon <HI>August</HI> the <HI>twelv'th</HI> day betime,</L>
<L>to valiant <HI>Green</HI> you may believe the same</L>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<L>In the morning to him ten ships appear</L>
<L>about <HI>Cherbrook,</HI> or at least very near.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho the matter is great, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That is by <HI>France</HI> Dukedom of <HI>Normandy,</HI></L>
<L>and this shall be the second Comedy,</L>
<L>That fatal <HI>Mars</HI> and then <HI>Saturn</HI> did play</L>
<L>a gallant game, <HI>Jupiters</HI> melody.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho the matter is great, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Was so roaring with Fulm'nating boults,</L>
<L>by seven a clock began to fly about's</L>
<L>In the morning, with such continuance</L>
<L>that five brave ships were out of countenance.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho the matter is great, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And what were they but to him belonging</L>
<L>that now is call'd and tearmed the <HI>French</HI> King:</L>
<L>So vapouring was the <HI>Admiral</HI> that he had</L>
<L>in his main top the white Gallican Flag.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho the matter is</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Which regarded by the worthy <HI>John Green,</HI></L>
<L>said in these words, afore they should be seen</L>
<L>So our Birth-right to take from us away</L>
<L>in that manner, first Ile submit to day</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In poor <HI>Fortune,</HI> so was his own ship call'd,</L>
<L>and rather will I reduce my self in thrall,</L>
<L>Then like a <HI>Mars</HI> inflam'd with valour</L>
<L>bad the <HI>French-man</HI> to strik down his colour.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To low'r a main, or else with all his power</L>
<L>He would endeavour to sink'm the same hour,</L>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<L>But the <HI>French</HI>-men trusting their multitude</L>
<L>of Guns, and ships with men were so delude</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As many are, that have not for their guide</L>
<L>that Deity, which doth abhor all pride,</L>
<L>Did utterly, absolutely deny</L>
<L>to low'r amain, nor unto him comply,</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then a broad-side was presently let fly</L>
<L>with violence, and so tempestuously</L>
<L>In a sudden that redoubling the flame,</L>
<L>Admiral nor Vice could not indure the same;</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But presently bras'd back came by the lee,</L>
<L>did not desire such furor more to see.</L>
<L>I must tell you also what was the matter,</L>
<L>'twas because they were shot under water.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No sooner then their working was perceive</L>
<L>Our Commander anon said wee'l contrive,</L>
<L>Another trick for them assuredly,</L>
<L>by which we shall give them further anoy.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then suddenly about he caus'd to tack't,</L>
<L>and presently the fore-sheet to be slack't,</L>
<L>Keeping the wind of these proud <HI>Franciskins,</HI></L>
<L>for better means to come to drob their skins.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon after this their best wings they did spread,</L>
<L>minding by that of us to be beray'd;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<L>But the vertue of valour being Print</L>
<L>in <HI>Albionmen</HI> in no ways shall bruant.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Indeed I must this much say passing by</L>
<L>that a concert we had never came nie,</L>
<L>Keeping far off in bloos did not delight</L>
<L>therefore his name shall be brought in the light.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hee's hennish and Henely in his name</L>
<L>is not Cockish therefore deserves no fame,</L>
<L>Little Hurly though his power was but little</L>
<L>in this conflight here he must have the title.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of a good hart, but what could he have done</L>
<L>of little Gunes matter half a dozine,</L>
<L>So we followed that audacious Navy</L>
<L>about 12 Leagues west-ward of <HI>Aldernie.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In that pursuit to <HI>Leward</HI> did appear</L>
<L>a lusty Ship which made us never fear,</L>
<L>Though it had been the best of all their guide</L>
<L>Captain nor men, for that were ne'r dismaid.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Happen it did that it was the good ship</L>
<L>rather, Frigot by name, called <HI>None-such,</HI></L>
<L>Well regulated and well Command at first</L>
<L>but at the last, did not fulfill his trust.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gently she gave the Frigot cardinal</L>
<L>five full broad sides, and no more that was all</L>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Away she went forsaking the fortune</L>
<L>to the hazard of wondring infortune.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Driving westwards Frigots and mighty ships</L>
<L>the <HI>Cardinall</HI> and the rest of his Sheeps,</L>
<L>Thirty two Guns of brass he had alone</L>
<L>as for the others no less then forty one.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fulminating against them said to said</L>
<L>without turning our course was never staid,</L>
<L>Muskets pettering, and our Guns as the Thunder.</L>
<L>of <HI>Jupiter</HI> kept such noyse that 'twas wonder.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To see a strame of wood upon Tetis</L>
<L>that is no lye, I speak but what it is,</L>
<L>The chips and splent of wood, down they did fly</L>
<L>as thick as hail discended from on high.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To tell the truth the foule was worth the Game</L>
<L>for within him in silver did contain,</L>
<L>Eight tuns or more, as very credibly</L>
<L>we were attest so well assuredly.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That if <HI>Millemy</HI> had the <HI>Non-such</HI> imploy'd</L>
<L>this great treasure in our hands should abide,</L>
<L>And the terror hereafter should remain</L>
<L>upon our foes, and unto us the gaime.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last this much for our Concert Henely</L>
<L>came up for shame, and gave them verily,</L>
<L>Few pretty blows, had he done first alike,</L>
<L>we had obtain'd victory never like.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<LG>
<L>Who interrupt at last this gallant fight,</L>
<L>none of our friends, but the child of the night,</L>
<L>Obscurity, and the darkness her sister</L>
<L>came upon us, and bad us to desist her.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To the great grief of all the Officers</L>
<L>both great and small, Sea-men and Marriners,</L>
<L>Who as Lyons most unanimously,</L>
<L>gallantly fought worthy to be employ.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All in good ships having the sole Command,</L>
<L>in several their vertue that demand</L>
<L>Worthy I say, but ne'r a one willing,</L>
<L>To abandon him nam'd at beginning.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Had he command upon the youngest horse</L>
<L>that <HI>Tetis</HI> hath and lying up old Harth.</L>
<L>Young horse I say on the new Friget,</L>
<L>within few days great honour he would get,</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To thish Nation, so magnanimous heart</L>
<L>he hath in him, and this shall be his part,</L>
<L>Capt. <HI>Mildmay,</HI> alas 'twas no victory</L>
<L>by which you can obtain a jot of glory,</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor to triumph for a little Friget</L>
<L>that there you took, and by our means you get;</L>
<L>But right valour had herein consist,</L>
<L>if after that you had come to assist,</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Worthy <HI>John Green</HI> against the Admiral,</L>
<L>we had carried the ships treasure and all</L>
<L>Home to <HI>England,</HI> for satisfaction</L>
<L>of some great wrong done to this Nation.</L>
<L><HI>Hi ho, the matter is great</HI></L>
<L><HI>now Sea-men fight</HI></L>
