<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<L>NOW the great Business of my Life is over;</L>
<L>That Clog to all my <HI>Cullidada</HI>'s hopes,</L>
<L>That still kept down and aw'd my aspiring heart,</L>
<L>Is now remov'd with silence and with safety:</L>
<L>And now my active Free-born Soul's at liberty.</L>
<L>Yes, <HI>Cullidada,</HI> he is gone indeed;</L>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>But you must needs confess with gratitude</L>
<L>My active prompting Tongue did first inflame</L>
<L>Thy shrinking Soul with courage and with reason.</L>
<L>Time and Intemperance, thou'dst often say,</L>
<L>Will soon perform (and that without our Crime)</L>
<L>The utmost of our Wishes and Desires:</L>
<L>But still thou would'st forget the falling snow</L>
<L>That then in flakes lay thick upon thy head,</L>
<L>Which the faint warmth, alas! of thy chill'd spirits</L>
<L>Will ne're, I fear, be able yet to thaw;</L>
<L>And would'st thou not my <HI>Cullidada</HI> grieve?</L>
<L>Nay, if (as our most holy Prophet tells us)</L>
<L>There's sense of pain and pleasure after death,</L>
<L>Would it not make thy Paradise a Hell,</L>
<L>To see thy vast ambitious Soul shrink back,</L>
<L>And skulk and herd with the ignoble crowd</L>
<L>Of uncrown'd Heads?</L>
<L>I grant indeed that Nature do's encroach,</L>
<L>And sometimes would confine our Appetites;</L>
<L>Honour, Religion, Friendship too sometimes</L>
<L>(Those bugbears of the crafty Priest's creatio</L>
<L>Will needs intrude to regulate our Fancies;</L>
<L>But these, alas, were at the first design'd</L>
<L>To influence the crowd, and to amuse</L>
<L>The giddy Rabble, while the King goes free,</L>
<L>And acts according to his inclination.</L>
<L>Tell me, did e're the <HI>Mufti</HI> (our High Priest,)</L>
<L>When any powerful Monarch did demand</L>
<L>Even what the most licentious would forbear,</L>
<L>Provided always it did not detract</L>
<L>From his own Glory, Interest and Power;</L>
<L>Tell me, I say, did ever he refuse,</L>
<L>Or with a tardy niggard hand send back</L>
<L>His Bulls, Indulgences, and Dispensations?</L>

<L>Well <HI>Hautefelia,</HI> I must praise thy care</L>

<L>We stand engaged.</L>
<L>'Tis true, the glorious lustre of a Crown,</L>
<L>Which by the easie temper of my Brother</L>
<L>I grew acquainted and familiar with,</L>
<L>Did so awaken my ambitious thoughts,</L>

<L>To share the pleasures of a beauteous Mistress,</L>
<L>Do yet with jealous eyes attend and watch,</L>
<L>Each fearing and suspecting partial Favours;</L>
<L>So I began to blame my unjust Fortune</L>
<L>That by a trick of Eldership had given</L>
<L>What my bold Genius told me I deserv'd,</L>
<L>Nay, and deserv'd alone.</L>

<SPEAKER>Rem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a scurvy Brother, who in a small dispute about Priority, even in my Mothers Belly, gave me a swinging box on the Ear, before I was aware, and by the advantage of that blow slipt into the World before me, and enjoys three thousand a Year in my prejudice; nay, though he has had the Ptysick, and labour'd under a Consumption these fourteen Years, has neither Chick nor Child, and can't spend the Tithe of his Rents, yet he won't give me a farthing to maintain me, and would as soon invite a Captain and his Troop to Free-quarters in his House, as me to take share of a Bottle of his Wine, or a Christ∣mass-dinner: Now Sir, here are your Chancellour and Confes∣sor, two Persons of Notorious Conscience and Piety, they un∣derstand my Case, and I beg your Majesties favourable deter∣mination.</P>

<SPEAKER>Barb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I know your Case very well, and if you would bring it before me, I should bring your Brother to reason; three thousand a Year, say you, and so inhumane to his only Brother? But I will be your Friend, not that I expect to be much a gain∣er, though I confess it will be a troublesome point: Three thousand a Year, said he, <STAGE>[aside this]</STAGE> A Man might pick up a handsome Portion for his Daughter out of it, and egad we must provide for those of our Houshold, as they say.</P>

<P>Now have I brought my self into a fine Praemunire, I have given them a hint of three thousand a Year, and I shall have them as troublesome to me as a hungry Kite to a brood of young Chickens: Oh! how they catch'd at the word, be∣fore it was well out of my mouth; and o' my Conscience will quarrel about the Dividend, though I have no more an Estate to lay claim to, than they have a stock of Conscience or Ho∣nesty: I spoke to fathom his dealing with his Brother, who is more than suspected to have had foul Play shown him; and though Men of least Conscience are commonly most quick of apprehension, yet for ought I could perceive they stumbled at my Parable, which I am glad of: Discretion must be the Badge of my Office, and Dissimulation the Dark Lanthorn to guide me.</P>

<P>Then to be plain, if he had dy'd seven Years ago, half the Women in the Town had run mad for him, but of late years these plaguy Politicians have kept such a pother about Sham-Plots, private Leagues, and a deal of such stuff, and going home to their Wives have told such lamentable Stories of him as quite turn'd their Hearts against him; and your Majesty knows poor silly Women are apt to believe any thing, God help them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, with submission, I'de have you do as several of your wise Predecessors have done before. I have read of some notable Queens of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> as well as of other neighbouring Countries, who when their Husbands have been troubled with the Pip, like old Cocks that have lost their spurs, or their thoughts so taken up with abstract notions of Divinity, that they have had no leisure to mind even the necessary carnal Affairs of the World; why then, mark me, these Queens fearing to lose the opportunity of having their Pictures drawn, (for that's the way that Queens transmit their memory to posterity) they have sat several times to se∣veral Limners, and so continu'd 'till the business has been done to the Life. Now, Madam, though I confess <HI>Cullidada</HI> has been a reputed good Painter in his time, yet now he's grown old, and his Hand shakes, his Pencil is worn, and his Eyes are bad, his Fancy pall'd, and his Colours corrupt, so that you
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>may better sit to a Sign-post dawber than to him; therefore Madam I advise you to send quickly for some of the most expert in the Trade; be assiduous and diligent; for hang me, I never grudg'd my pains so I could gain my ends; and in a very short time you'll find a happy alteration in your Affairs.</P>

<P>SO so! we are like to have warm work on't e'faith; this late Scene of Mirth and Joy for our new King and Queen may probably prove like the last blaze of a Candle spent in the socket: Young <HI>Philodemus</HI> they say is Landed in the West with a trusty Troop of <HI>Myrmidons,</HI> and sets up for the Christian Religion: Ha, ha, this Religion is the most quarrel∣some thing in the World. There has not been a War in <HI>Europe</HI> this many Ages, but Religion still came in for a share; and Hea∣ven knows, they that make most pother about it have commonly least to do with it: Well, what the event may be I cannot di∣vine; but it is certain, this young Prince carries a great stroke in the Peoples Hearts, though in reality, he is but Na∣tural Son to the late King; and has no more right to the Crown of <HI>Hungary,</HI> than I have to be King of <HI>Poland;</HI> however this good may come of his Enterprize, that if he escapes, though he be vanquished, he'll serve for a bridle to the exorbitant humour of our haughty ill-designing Queen, and to correct the weak∣ness of an obstinate bigotted King. I have heard part of her de∣signs; and how to advance the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion in <HI>Hungary,</HI> she would not scruple to expose her Husbands Honour, her own Chastity, or the Kingdoms Welfare and Peace; but let her drive on, I have a reserve in store for her, that will make her Minions scratch, her self chafe, and <HI>Cullidada</HI> tremble; that will make him turn his tune of Obedience without <HI>Reserve,</HI> and be

His people set him up, though excluded by Law, and chose rather to be guided by their love to his Family, than by the reasonable Rules of even necessary Politicks; they generously fixed all their thoughts on the King, and never dis∣puted the Errours of the <HI>Pagan;</HI> and how well they are likely to be paid for their kindness, the <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Pietro</HI> have too late∣ly declared.

The next is Monsieur <HI>Stephano de la Colledge,</HI> with a Halter about his Neck. The next is the Count <HI>de Esseycke,</HI> who points to his Throat, which is cut so deep, that his Head seems ready to fall off. The next are the Lord <HI>Rossellio,</HI> and the Sieur <HI>le Sydeny,</HI> who have two Golden Rings about their Necks, by which their Heads seem to be
