<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T Holds not alwaies that the best and most virtu∣ous Princes finde faithfull and obedient Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts; but rather on the contrary, clemency and goodnesse are requited with strange unthankfulnesse, or mon∣strous Rebellions. The present and sad experience of His Majesty the King of England, who was borne to the most unquestioned Right of three Imperiall Crownes, sees them all in a raging fit of a distempered Rebellion, his Queene forced to flee away for refuge and protection: The Prince (the Heire apparent to the Crowne) with other the Royall Branches en∣during a base imprisonment, or a forced absence, and Majesty it selfe confinde by the bloody O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dnances of cruell and barbarous Tray∣tors, who first pretending a Reformation, and at last blaspheming more freely to a Saint-ship, have violated all the Rules of duty to God and man, squaring all things acording to the humor of their fancy, and thereby tumbling the world into another Chaos, and new confusion. The King (for many yeares past) hath endeavoured to correct these bold presumptions, by meeting impudent Rebellion in the field; but the torrent swelling too high, His Majesty was o∣ver borne, and what he could not compleate by a Martiall power, he suffers for (though an unworthy imprisonment) by an Angelicall patience, in whose sad afflictions all Loyall Subjects and good Chri∣stians beare a part and share: and now providence hath given some advantage to an Illustrious and hopefull Prince to enter on the scene, and act a part in this bloody Tragedy, who after two yeares conti∣nuance in France, with his Royall Mother the Queene, at length takes his leave, making his first j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urney to Calais, and after a few dayes continuance there prepares himselfe for a passage into Holland, which succeeded with a prosperous Gale; and being aboard, a States man of war on Munday the 13. of July <HI>(stilo veceri)</HI> His High∣nesse arived at Helversluce, the next day following in the afternoon; but before he put his foot in shooe he had the happy view of a Noble part of the Royall Navy, where the Duke of York, attended
<PB N="2" REF="2"/> with many Loyall hearts, had their expectations filled with over∣flowing joyes: Their showting and acclamations were exceeding high for such an accesse of happinesse; and the Seamen, and Can∣nons plaid their parts, and with their loud voices roared out their joyfull apprehentions, filling the Region of the Ayre and tryum∣phing over the waters, with high expressions of chearfullnes; that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prince of wales was now with them. And now the tide of rejoi∣cing past over, His Hignesse goes on shore; and having suddenly met with the Duke of Yorke; the two Princes congratulated their happy meeting, and with love unspeakable embraced each other: The day following the Prince of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange made an early visit to the Prince of Wales, and the matchlesse Princesse, the Princesse Roy∣all made all hast to wait on her Brother, thinking every minute too tedious untill she enjoyed His presence: The Queene of Bohemia and her family made all possible speed to welcome this Princely Guest; and after a few dayes or rather howers spent in salutation, the Prince directs His thoughts for a voyage by Sea, and minding the businesse of the Navy, bids farewell to His Royall friends: And on Thursday after His Highnesse arived at Helve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sl uce: He went aboard the Admirall, where after some second expressions of chearfulnesse, he was received with great Testimonies of duty and obedience; and the winds not blowing faire for the Downes, the command was given to beare Northward towards Yarmouth Rode: And upon Saturday following about a in the afternoone, the whole Fleet atten∣tending His Highnesse cast Anchor in that Rode, where after an hower or two it was resolved, that a Gentleman should be sent with a Letter of kindenesse, and with certaine heads of the Princes De∣claration the better to invite and animate that Corporation to their obedience: But some of the enimies Troopers guarding the Shore, forced the Messenger to returne to the Navy <HI>(Re infecta,)</HI> so by rhat interuption the Princes good intentions to the Towne, and the Townsmen good affections to the Prince were not understood at that time: The next day being Sunday, the Navy floting on the Sea, and the people amazed in the Towne, both continued in great admiration of each other; the Fleet wondred at the peoples strange undutifulnesse towards their Prince, and the People scar'd into a timerous, and benummed neutrality stared towards the Fleete with various distracted affections: The distempers and discompo∣sures in the Towne were very furious for a fit: at last their feare exceeded their love and Honour to their Prince, and forgetting
<PB N="3" REF="2"/> what an opportunity they had to welcome their Prince so grea a stranger: that night was spent in frozen cold expressions, and the night approaching summoned rest and silence for that season.</P>
<P>In the Morning some petty expressions of du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y dared to appeare, and His Highnesse had a taste of some loyall Adventures, which by boat came to the Admirall from persons well affected and deeply tou∣ched with the sence of so great persons neernesse to the Towne. And after a while betwixt 6 and 7 of the clock on munday morning (the Townsmen having summoned their wits together the day before) it was resolved in a publique meeting: That one of the Aldermen of the Towne should come and visit the Prince, and accordingly (a small Boat being set off from the shore) a trim Townsman neatly drest up in a great double Ruffe, and in his satten doublet, speedily came to the Admirall, where having performed his devoir to the Prince, he out with his purse and impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently told His Highnesse, that the Towne was resolved to admit no forces of either side: But if His Highnesse pleased to command any refreshments from the Towne, His pleasure should be obeyed. His Highnesse then consi∣dering the staggering humor of the People, or rather more seriously the casuall condition of the Towne so nearly waited on by a malici∣ous enemy, accepted the motion of refreshments; and having Or∣dred commands for that purpose, the word was given for the whole Fleet to waigh Anchor, and the winde being courteous, to hoyse up sayles and to steere towards the Downes: which motion being obser∣ved by the Townesmen, they were free with their Canon at our fare∣well, and they discharged their O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dnance round the Towne, which was interpreted a testimony of their cheerefulnes, and loyalty, rather then of their feare or neglect. On the Wednesday following, the Na∣vy came with a fayre quarter wind into the Downes: at whose first approach the two fair Castles of Deale and Sandowne discharged their Ordnance for joy, and the severalll ships were mutuall and kind in their expressions: and now the whole fleet having cast anchor in the Downes, fresh occasions were given for better advantages: Some designes were proposed for enriching and encreasing of the Navy, that the Seamen might prove the more couragious, and the Fleet more formidable to all opposition. But some more heady and impatient motions started suddenly on foot: And some of the Offi∣cers and Seamen grew fierce and violent for the Land service, and the reliefe of the two besieged Castles of Deale and Sandowne; and the sudden raising of the whole County of Kent, was a fancy that
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> vainly hurryed away the mindes of some, whose precipitate violence hath since recompenced their hasty indiscretion: some lesse experi∣enced courages thought to remove mountaines as well as ride over waves, and made no doubt of heating Horse and Foot from before the Castle with their musquets and pikes: But the mixt body of Souldiers and Seamen (under the conduct of Sir <HI>John Boys</HI> and Major Generall <HI>Gibson</HI>) being about the number of 600. in the whole, and all Foot, were after a gallant adventure, mightily overpowred by a numerous Body of Horse and Foot of the enemy; so that the retreat was for∣ced to Sandowne Castle, and some few slaine (to about the Number of fifteene) and ninety three being taken prisoners, according to a list of their names, sent from the enemy by a trumpet the nex mor∣ning: The rest of the Souldiers retired to Sandowne Castle for pre∣sent shelter. And the skirmish over, they were the same day before night reimbarked into the severall ships of the Navy: But though an importunate violence (not to be satisfied) occasioned some mis∣fortunes on shoare, the windes and tydes brought better successe at Sea: And in a short time the Navy began to swell with new additi∣ons of strength and wealth. Each ship was diligent in their duty to attend the North and South furlongs. And the Convertine and Blackmore Lady not a little prosperous; all the Fleet carefully ob∣serving that no ship might passe without acknowledgment and duty to the Admirall now in the Downes the Kings chamber. And a guard being commanded for obedience, the Fleet did sudainely thrive to greater power: But amidst the occurrences at Sea, the Prince considers the Affaires at Land: And in order to his Royal Fathers businesse, thinkes meete to dispatch a Gentleman to the tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Houses at Westminster, with a letter of kindnesse to the House of Lords, and a Declaration inclosed; thereby manifesting to all the world his Princely inclinations and desires to the peace and happinesse of the Kingdome; but the Gentleman was in a few dayes returned, brin∣ging no answer to his Highnesse that contained nothing in it but craft and wonted stubburnesse, plainely discovering that the men of Westminster were resolved rather to sacrifice the hopes of all mens happinesse to their ambition, lust, and avarice, then part with the least mite of their usurped power; and this occcasioned an utter differ∣ment of all future motions to that purpose; but whilst those on shore are so brutish and monstrous, the Sea gave good advantages of assi∣stance, And first the Cormant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne a new ship (laden for Ginnye in the West Indyes, and now named the <HI>Charles</HI> by the Prince himselfe)
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> was reduced from that imployment to serve his Highnesse, and proves a bold and gallant Frygot. The <HI>Love,</HI> another tall and gallant ship (returning from the Streits out of the Venetian sercice, formerly im∣ployed against the Turks) was received (passing through the Downs) into service, and made a man of war to attend the Navy; some other ships of great importance and service were there admitted, and li∣sted for attendance and commands, which proved cheerefull additi∣ons of strength and power. And now after some weekes spent at Anchor in the Downes; notice and alarum was given of the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Preparations, and comming for Sea: After which ad∣vertisement, his Highnesse advising with his Counsell of war, thought fit to weigh Anchor, and saile from the Downes towards Lee-Rode, being the mouth of the Riuer Thames to dare and encounter all op∣position which spuriously presumed to affront Royalty, and to make triall whether the Earle of Warwicke durst sayle with the Royall Standard and Flag in his Main Top. The Seamen were extreamly for∣ward in the design; and (though some counsels were clean a verse) yet after the Prince understood that Warwick was certainly drawn downe from Gravesend, his courage countermaunded all counsels.</P>
<P>And in publick Aboard the Admirall His Highnesse cheerefully de∣clared his Resolutions for Lee-Rode, which discovery of his for∣wardnesse so animated the hearty Sea-men, that they presently see∣med as eager and violent as hungry Lyons to search out and pursue the pray; that dared to appeare under such a brazen faced rebellious countenance: And from these motions, the flames of Resolution grew speedily more fervent over all the Navy; and all things are prepared and postured for a fight at Sea, if the enemy durst grapple or engage. To this purpose a new Command was given on Sunday the seaven and twenty of <HI>August,</HI> the severall ships to weigh Anchor, and sayle towards the Rebellious Party; whose more nimble and scouting Frygots were fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st discerned on the Tuesday following, which sight so encouraged the hearts of all the Fleet attending the Prince; that the Officers and Sea-men brake forth into new expres∣sions of joy, not doubting but to reduce the Rebels to submisse o∣bedience, or else resolving to dye in a Cause so just and honourable. And this resolution was confirmed by an Oath of fidelity (which the Officers and Sea-men voluntarily tooke in his Highnesse Presence, going aboard each ship) to be true and faithfull to his Highnesse Per∣son and Commands against the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> power, and all his Adherents and Confederates. And after these great pledges of fide∣lity
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> was given on Wednesday morning; the Fleet made all the sayle they could, &amp; pursued the Frygots (first discovered the night before) which suddainly returning to their Mock-Admirall, told the newes of the Princes Approach with his Fleet, which made them (being then under saile) to tack about: And they basely fled, and suffered the pursuite for ten Leagues at least, the Channell growing more narrow, the Sands numerous on each side, and the night approaching, the en∣gagements, were somewhat the longer deferrd; for the next morning (after the misty fog was first dispersed) the Princes whole Navy weighed Anchor againe, resolved to fight with the enemy, whether lying at Anchor or under Saile; all preparations were hastened in the severall ships, the Cabins in an instant knockt downe, and slung into the Sea, the guns primed and leveled, the granads and fire balls ready, and severall gunners with their linstocks ordered in their severall quarters: And all persons diligent to obey commands, resolved to beate and conquer the enemy, or dye bravely. And yet before the endeavour of farther attempt; it pleased the Gracious Prince to try if a Message of peace and pardon could mollifie obdurate Traytours, and divers or prevent the effusion of English blood; Anciently Acts of grace did ingage the people, <HI>obsequio mitigantur imperia:</HI> And kinde M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges very prevalent with civ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Heathens. To this purpose the Prince was pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to send a groome of his Bed-chamber to <HI>War∣wick,</HI> with a Letter to prepare his Loyalty and obedience; but his Committee-M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sters so ordered their Cypher-Admirall, that a base and unworthy answer was returned, much to this purpose: That his Warwickship was (forsooth) Lord High Admirall by a Commission from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he two Houses at westminster; and that he could not strike the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gge in his mainetop to any Person whomsoever; which Re∣bellious defyance made all Loyal Resolutions much more keene, and hastened the Princes Fleet to more speedy revenge; which was on Thursday attempted with many desperate haz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds to engage the ene∣my; but his Mock-Admiralship avoides all offers of fighting: And flying as neere the shoare as possible, would not endure the breath of a Canon, nor the sight of a broad side. Amongst other exchanges of the day: The Prince in the Admirall was very forward, and cal∣ling for his Armes, ready to engage, minded more the preservation of his Honour then his Person; notwithstanding all importunities of his Counsell, and the Sea-men so earnest for his safety: He answe∣red that he dreaded no hazard in such a Cause, but persisted resolute and undaunted to encounter with the greatest danger, equally with
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> the meanest Person ingaged, and following the <HI>George,</HI> wherein <HI>War∣wick</HI> was, made often at him: But <HI>Warwick</HI> still looked either to the mouth of Chattam River for the Protection of Queenburrough Ca∣stle, or towards the mouth of the River of Thames, that he might be secure of the block houses neere Graves end. Another handsome piece of Gallantry, the Vice-Admirall of the Princes Fleet did ma∣nifest by pursuing <HI>Warwicks</HI> Mock-Vice-Admirall so long, and to such a neerenesse, that if she durst have stayd, or shewed any courage, the engagement must sudainely proved very bloody, or very glorious to one of the two: The Swallow the Reare-Admirall in the Princes Fleet, was very impatient of Attendance, and in order made a swift pursuite after <HI>Warwicks</HI> ship; but he durst not stay to give or take a broad side from any of the Princes ships; but still crept neerer the shoare towards Queenburrough Castle: And thus the great ships and frygots having plyed too and againe to ingage the enemy to fight, a violent storme of winds and tempest sudainly arising, discres∣sion forced the Princes whole Fleet to cast Anchor againe; and darkenesse parted further disputes for that night following: The n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt day being F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yday, the winds blew faire to goe to Sea, and they seemed to breath an invitation to either Fleet, where they might have Sea roome to fight and end the quarrell: And betwix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> six and seaven of the clock, the command was given in the Princes Fleet to weigh Anchor, and hoise up sailes, where the Channell being na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow, the Sands numerous, and the way dangerous, by reason of a Passage called the Spits (where many Sea-wracks yet appeare) the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> et sai∣led very gently lest they should be too soone ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Warwicks</HI> sight, and the motion was ordered the more slow to dare <HI>Warwicks</HI> compa∣ny to a more proper conveniency of fighting: And for some nine or ten Leagues <HI>Warwicke</HI> seemed to be inclined to that purpose, and three Frigots of his mocke Vice-Admirall, came neere sometimes, and once within distance of Canon shot: and two small Ships of the Princes fleet loytering in the Reare, were lagging like easie sweet baits to in∣vite <HI>Warwicks</HI> Frigots to make greater haste: which (the Rear Admi∣rall the Swallow being past by) they seemed to gape more greedily hoping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o seaze on the smaller vessels, though they durst not be enga∣ged by any that were their equalls: But the Princes Reare-Admirall well knowing her duty suddenly tackt about and turned the Helme a lee, and her Sales halled up, she presently gave deafince to <HI>War∣wicks</HI> three Frygots, and the mock-Vice Admirall: nay that Tacking about checked <HI>Warwicks</HI> whole Fleet, which presently halled up
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> their Sailes, and cast their Anchors: And by this meanes the lesser vessels, more deepely laden to recover security neare the Princes Ad∣mirall: At which sight 16 Colliers ships attending <HI>Warwick</HI> like stout men of War, speedily parted from <HI>Warwicks</HI> Feet, and some of them made for London to the men of Westminster to bring the newes from Lee-Rode of their Apish Admirall, whose Commission they had created by a broad Seale, and whose Person they have since declared valiant by a monstrous Ordinance: But the enemy thus cowardly scar'd from the Princes Company, contented themselves with a secure riding at Anchor, and hated the sight of Sea Roome; where His Highnesse was present. And yet all danger was no ut∣terly avoyded, there lay another Trap in the way, yet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣visions in the Princes Fleet well understood; some of the sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps ha∣ving tasted nothing but dry bisquet, or salt wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er for some daye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be∣fore, and a pinching necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y amongst them all. This condition forced His Highnesse to command the Fleet to steare towards Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in Holland to refresh and victuall the Navy; which course was held, but by the way the Princes Fleet met with another Sea-Monster, A Parliament Fleet sent from Portsmouth consisting of about 6 great ships besides Pinks, Frigots, and hoys, which lay at Anchor in the <HI>channell and passage to Gory; But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey snudged close, and being coole in courage lay still without light or Noise. The time was now about nine at night, and it was very dark, but it hapned that the Swallow, the Rear Admirall to the Princely Fleet, sailed in the very guts and middest of them all, and haled to them, and finding them to be another sort of a Rebellious supply, presently resolved to give them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l some mark and testimony of courage and resolution before she parted, and in a very trice of time she made ready her guns, and fired three pieces of Ordnance at them, which caused the Portsmouth Fleet to make a terrible outcry, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that they would cut their Cables, and follow, but the timerous souls were not further disputed with, by reason the Princes Fleet held on their course, and could not return to an ingage∣ment, where the wind and tyde so mightily opposed. And this second Fleet thus handsomely tryed and avoided, the Princes Fleet steered on for Holland, and the next day being Friday about three in the afternoon, His Highnesse with all His N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y came safe to Gory, and the Fleet is now at anchor at Helversl uce in Holland, and <HI>Warwick</HI> with his Colliers and Frigots in Gory-rode, thinking to pursue the ad∣vantage he conceived before him (ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wants of victuall and tackling;) but we are providing our selves, and shortly hope to pluck his Rebellious plumes of pride, or we will sink by his sides: Our men (what er'e you heare at London) resent so well the Parliaments mercy at Colchester are resolved to sell their bloods at dearer rates, then ten shillings a head to the Summer Islands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Princes Highness hath his Navie in a very good order, well man'd and vi∣ctuall'd, and fitted for service. A new treachery discovered against the <HI>Fleet,</HI> but hap∣pily prevented by the Prudence of the Prince.</HI></P>
