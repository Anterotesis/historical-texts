<LG>
<L>O Happy Fire, whose Heat can thus controul</L>
<L>The Rust of Age, &amp; thaw the Frost of Death;</L>
<L>That renders Man immortal, as his Soul.</L>
<L>And swells his Fame with everlasting Breath.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y"/>
<L>Happy that hand, that unto Honours climb;</L>
<L>Can lift the Subject of his living Praise;</L>
<L>That rescues Frailty from the Scyth of Time,</L>
<L>And equals Glory to the length of Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, Sir, in you, who uncontroul'd, as Fate</L>
<L>In the Black Bosom of Oblivions Night;</L>
<L>Can Suns of Immortality create,</L>
<L>To dazle Envy with prevailing Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain they strive your glorious Lamp to hide</L>
<L>In this dark Lanthorn, to all Noble Minds;</L>
<L>Which through the smallest cranny is descry'd,</L>
<L>Whose Force united, no resistance finds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest be my Father, who has found his Name</L>
<L>Among the Heroes, by your Pen reviv'd;</L>
<L>By Running in Times Wheel, his thriving Fame</L>
<L>Shall still more youthful grow, and longer liv'd.</L>

<L>Had <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Trophies thus been rear'd,</L>

</LG>

<L>Let men of greater Wealth than Merit, cast</L>
<L>Medals of Gold for their succeeding part;</L>
<L>That Paper Monument shall longer last,</L>

<L><HI>To dark</HI> Verona: Orna <HI>is betray'd,</HI></L>

<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>UNlucky Fire, which tho from Heaven deriv'd,</L>
<L>Is brought too late like Cordials to the Dead,</L>
<L>When all are of their Sovereign sence depriv'd,</L>
<L>And Honour which my rage should warm is fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>Dead to Heroick Song this Isle appears,</L>
<L>The ancient Musick of Victorious Verse:</L>
<L>They tast no more, than he his Dirges hears,</L>
<L>Whose useless Mourners sing about his Herse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>Yet shall this Sacred Lamp in Prison burn,</L>
<L>And through the darksom Ages hence invade</L>
<L>The wondring World, like that in <HI>Tullie</HI>'s Urn,</L>
<L>Which tho by time conceal'd, was not decay'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<L>And <HI>Charles</HI> in that more civil Century,</L>
<L>When this shall wholly fill the Voyce of Fame,</L>
<L>The busie Antiquaries then will try</L>
<L>To find amongst their Monarchs Coins thy Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>They will admire thy force gainst <HI>Gothick</HI> rage,</L>
<L>Thy Head of <HI>Athens,</HI> and thy Woman breast,</L>
<L>Which rescu'd these Records in a rude Age,</L>
<L>When the free Arts were frighted, and opprest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<L>If they who read thy Victories, thus confest,</L>
<L>Find not thy wreathed Image, their blind Skill</L>
<L>In gath'ring Monarchs Medals, they'll detest,</L>
<L>And think they made their long Collections ill.</L>

<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<L>They'll highly bless thy Vertue, by whose Fire</L>
<L>I keep my Lawrel warm, which else would sade,</L>
<L>And thus enclos'd, think me of Nature's Quire</L>
<L>The chief, who still sing sweetest in the shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>To Fame who rules the World, I lead thee now,</L>
<L>Whose solid Power the thoughtful understand,</L>
<L>Whom tho too late, weak Princes to her Bow,</L>
<L>The People serve, and Poets can command.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>9.</HEAD>
<L>And Fame the only Guide to Empires past,</L>
<L>Shall to <HI>Verona</HI> lead thy Fancie's Eyes,</L>
<L>When Night so black a Robe on Nature cast,</L>
<L>As Nature seem'd afraid of her Disguise.</L>

<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>10.</HEAD>
<L>Ambitious <HI>Hubert</HI> to <HI>Verona</HI> came</L>
<L>In the dark Reign of Universal Sleep;</L>
<L>And means no Tears shall quench his Angers flame,</L>
<L>Tho all the Dwellers must be wak'd to weep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>11.</HEAD>
<L>Till Fame had made the Duke's Adoption known,</L>
<L>He painfully supprest this raging Fire;</L>
<L>But now it was above his Conduct grown,</L>
<L>And <HI>Bergio</HI> thus provok'd it to aspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>12.</HEAD>
<L>Thy Wealth, thou painted City, who shall saye?</L>
<L>Black art thou now, and sleep thy business seems;</L>
<L>Each dark abode is silent as the Grave,</L>
<L>Thy sleep were perfect Death if Death had Dreams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>13.</HEAD>
<L>Thou civil Crowd of soft Inhabitants,</L>

<L>No more relieve thy thirsty Medows wants,</L>
<L>But swelling here; thy drowning <HI>Lethe</HI> be.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>14.</HEAD>
<L>Wake but to kindle lust, and boldly think</L>
<L>Heaven has no Eyes, but the departed Sun;</L>
<L>May thy new marri'd at Adult'ries wink,</L>
<L>Both soon seek Strangers, and each other shun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>15.</HEAD>
<L>Sleep you who Ruin States by Trades Encrease,</L>
<L>Rich Traffickers who fetch those Toyes from far,</L>
<L>Which soften us at home, you plead for Peace,</L>
<L>Because our Luxuries we quit in War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>16.</HEAD>
<L>Sleep as securely as your Carricks steer,</L>
<L>When in deep Seas your Gale is from the East,</L>
<L>You and Your Pilots want the Art to fear</L>
<L>The suddain Tempest breeding in my Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>17.</HEAD>
<L>You Statesmen sleep, who States tame Lyons be</L>
<L>For you and Lyons sleep with open Eyes,</L>
<L>And shut 'em when you wake, you seem to see</L>
<L>Through darkness, and with Wink your sight dis∣guise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>18.</HEAD>
<L>Sleep you Oppressors, Monsters quickly bred,</L>
<L>When private Will is joyn'd to publick Power,</L>
<L>Like Bears in Winter long by slumber fed,</L>
<L>You wake with Hunger, that would Herds devour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>19.</HEAD>
<L>Sleep all, till waking each with ravisht Mind,</L>
<L>Shall the strange Glory of new Light admire,</L>
<L>And thinking 'tis the Morn, Curse when ye find,</L>
<L>Your City is become your Funeral Fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>20.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Bargio</HI> did <HI>Hubert</HI>'s Fury thus excite,</L>
<L>Which from his darkn'd thoughts breaks through his Eyes</L>
<L>As suddainly as Morning breaks from Night,</L>
<L>Oh glorious <HI>Chiefs</HI> from sleep to Battle rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>21.</HEAD>
<L>And now the Morn in suddain Glory rose,</L>
<L>And to salute the World, shifts from his Face</L>
<L>Night's Veil, as fast as Bolder unmask to those</L>
<L>Whom they saluting, would with kindness Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>22.</HEAD>
<L>To restless <HI>Hubert, Borgio</HI> leads the way,</L>
<L>Near <HI>Orna</HI>'s Window <HI>Hurgonil</HI> he spies,</L>
<L>Who there with Musick welcomes Break of Day,</L>
<L>And as the Lark the East salutes her Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>23.</HEAD>
<L>For there at ev'ry dawn with Lovers layes,</L>
<L>Till this sweet Moon shall end their nuptial Rites,</L>
<L>And Joyes begin, he love <HI>Reveillees</HI> payes,</L>
<L>Which made their morning sweet as Lovers nights,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>24.</HEAD>
<L>Such Aires the untun'd <HI>Borgio</HI> ill abides,</L>
<L>For Musick which is so the Soul of Love,</L>
<L>As Love is of our Life, his Soul derides,</L>
<L>Whom only Drums ambitions Noice could move.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>25.</HEAD>
<L>He oft sends back, as he does forward pass,</L>
<L>His fatal Looks, which did the Count less awe</L>
<L>Than did that Amorous, but more dreadful Face,</L>
<L>Which he too soon in <HI>Orna</HI>'s window saw,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>26.</HEAD>
<L>For there appear'd, tho but obliquely plac'd,</L>
<L>As shrunk behind the Glass, a Youth, who seem'd</L>
<L>Repleat with all those Graces, which have grac'd</L>
<L>Great Courts, or greater Love has e'er esteem'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>27.</HEAD>
<L>Such seem'd this Amorous Youth, who soon with∣drew</L>
<L>His Looks, and shut the Casement hastily,</L>
<L>As if he only watch'd to scape from view,</L>
<L>By stealth would see, and to be seen was shy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>28.</HEAD>
<L>A Youth, who thus his Beauty seems to hide,</L>
<L>So guiltlessly in a suspicious time,</L>
<L>And in the Chamber of a plighted Bride,</L>
<L>Might blot the whitest Vertue with a Crime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>29.</HEAD>
<L>Yet this as Loves false Fire, the Count did scorn.</L>
<L>Grave <HI>Tybalt,</HI> who these Rites attended, seems</L>
<L>So lost in Sleep, as if not yet the Morn</L>
<L>Were broke, and ranks his Vision with his Dreams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>30.</HEAD>
<L>Yet Jealousie, which does by Thoughts subsist,</L>
<L>As Life by Air; grew stronger by their pause;</L>
<L>For they their Musick silently dismist,</L>
<L>And fearing ill Effects, must doubt the Cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>31.</HEAD>
<L>Musick which here at <HI>Orna</HI>'s dawn had sung,</L>
<L>For Love's Morn breaks not in a common Sky;</L>
<L>But now their Lutes did seem on Willows hung,</L>
<L>Where near some murmuring Brook dead Lovers lye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>32.</HEAD>
<L>Wain Jealousie, thou fruitful little Seed,</L>
<L>Tho single, and as small as Atoms sown,</L>
<L>Yet faster riseth than a forward Weed,</L>
<L>In many Stems soon great and fully blown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>33.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis Love's Alarm Bell too often hung</L>
<L>Near Lover's Beds, and keeps 'em still awake;</L>
<L>Yet Noble <HI>Hurgonil,</HI> when first it rung,</L>
<L>Scarce seem'd to start, and now thus calmly spake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="21" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>34.</HEAD>
<L>Since Love the valiant Aids I must not dread</L>
<L>A Shadows force, and I should vain appear,</L>
<L>To let my Eyes be by a Vision led</L>
<L>From Her whose Image in my Heart I wear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>35.</HEAD>
<L>Such Maiden Stratagems each plighted Bride,</L>
<L>Rul'd by her Virgin Counsel does devise;</L>
<L>And thus my Faith in <HI>Orna</HI> must be tri'd,</L>
<L>Faith's Fort is best attempted by Surprise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>36.</HEAD>
<L>She as betroath'd does till this Moon be past,</L>
<L>And Marriage Laws begin by Custom Sway,</L>
<L>And now she tempts my Jealousie to taste</L>
<L>How I will Reign, when she must long obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="22" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>37.</HEAD>
<L>That Youth her near Ally, such harmless Art</L>
<L>Assists, which may to Country Eyes seem bold;</L>
<L>But Courts <HI>Elixir</HI> Vertue does convert</L>
<L>The worst and most suspected Coyn to Gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>38.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Tybalt</HI> repll'd, this Tryal, <HI>Hurgonil,</HI></L>
<L>Exalts you both, it proves your love not light,</L>
<L>And shews that she wants guilt to give her Skill,</L>
<L>Where to direct her Jealous Tryals right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>39.</HEAD>
<L>Your solid healthful Love sweats not away</L>
<L>At the faint Heat of Jealousies pale Flame,</L>
<L>Nor even in Death will more than Souls decay,</L>
<L>Which dye not, but return from whence they came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="23" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>40.</HEAD>
<L>And since her Tryal is so useless made,</L>
<L>Her Errour does her Innocence proclaim;</L>
<L>For as we trace strange Thieves by known Thieve aid</L>
<L>So our own Guilt lights us to others Shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>41.</HEAD>
<L>The Guilty often wake, when Jealous grown,</L>
<L>To watch Love's Treasons in another's Bed;</L>
<L>Yet after foul Adulteries in their own,</L>
<L>Sleep as secure from Terrors as the Dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>42.</HEAD>
<L>Thus as they homeward move, they timely draw</L>
<L>Discretion's Curtain o'r each others Eyes,</L>
<L>And would not see, what they with Sorrow saw,</L>
<L>Truth oft more modest seems in a Disguise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="24" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>43.</HEAD>
<L>Wise Nature does reprove our Jealousie,</L>
<L>'Tis Fear, and Fear none willingly express,</L>
<L>The Jealous shrink like Spies from every Spy,</L>
<L>And what they find with Honours less confess.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>44.</HEAD>
<L>But why (misterious Love) to blemish Truth</L>
<L>In truest Lovers hast thou Art devis'd?</L>
<L>Even in the Artless Sex, for that fair Youth</L>
<L>Was <HI>Gartha</HI> in a manly shape disguis'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>45.</HEAD>
<L>Whose Beauty stoop'd to <HI>Hermegild</HI>'s advice,</L>
<L>And she of <HI>Ʋlpha, Orna</HI>'s Woman bought</L>
<L>The Jewel Honour at a common price,</L>
<L>And was by stealth to <HI>Orna</HI>'s Chamber brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>46.</HEAD>
<L>There she in Night's black Bosom lay,</L>
<L>As in dark Lanthorns Light for Treason lyes,</L>
<L>And so when she peep'd forth, 'twas to betray,</L>
<L>As those were made to shine for a Surprise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>47.</HEAD>
<L>Calm <HI>Orna</HI> fearless slept, since free from Sin,</L>
<L>And little did her Womans duty doubt,</L>
<L>Nor heard when she had took the Traytors in,</L>
<L>Who through her Windows let her Honour out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>48.</HEAD>
<L>And still she slept with as becalm'd a Breast,</L>
<L>As thoughtless Martyrs in a Monument,</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Gartha</HI> (whose Success her Cares encreas'd)</L>
<L>Shifts her Disguise, and to her Palace went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="26" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>49.</HEAD>
<L>Where <HI>Hubert</HI> longingly expects that she</L>
<L>The reason of her Absence should unfold,</L>
<L>Who big with Plot longs for delivery,</L>
<L>And thinks Successes lost that are not told.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>And at her Frowns has many a Lover dy'd.</L>

<L>The two fierce Leaders gravely thoughtful grow</L>
<L>Like scar'd Astrologers, as griev'd to take</L>
<L>From this new Comet in her threatening Brow,</L>
<L>The Empires Doom, and thus her Passion spake.</L>
