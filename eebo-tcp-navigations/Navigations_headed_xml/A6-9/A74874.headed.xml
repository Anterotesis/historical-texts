<HEAD>TO THE READER. His <HI>CHARACTER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Ancients are of opinion that hee came of the race of the <HI>Centaures,</HI> and it may passe for currant, his upper part being lesse then Man, and his lower more then Beast; no Horse hath such a switch∣ing Stomack: He loves <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Kitchin,</HI> not so much for their Law as for their Names sakes, and at <HI>Bacon</HI> his mouth waters; he knowes better how to han∣dle a Chyne of Beefe then a Cause, for he has more gutts then braines, and doubtlesse there was a stout Thrasher spoyled when he was made a Lawyer: Hee is rather of the body Corporate then Politique; the round Table is no more to him then the square, let him have meate e∣nough (if such a thing may be possible) he cares not if it be in a Wheelebarrow, and makes but one meale a day, that is from morning to night: He is a great ene∣my to a long Grace, and holds that 'tis time enough to give thanks when his Gorge is full, for then he hath
<PB REF="3"/>most leasure, he carryes a bottomlesse <HI>Pit</HI> about him, by the Vulgar called his <HI>Maw,</HI> which has buryed more flesh in a week, then <HI>Stepney Church-yard</HI> hath done <HI>Bo∣dyes</HI> this dozen yeares; He has one virtue, that is, He drinks seldome, but when he falls to't he payes it, or some body for him; he sayes he cannot endure to make a Sea of his Belly, but a Shambles he may for the slaughtered: He walks in the Street like <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> in Robes of Purple, but not like <HI>Dives</HI> in fine Linnen; for he holds Shirts unnecessary, and his Cloaths are so Or∣namented with Patches, that many are buryed alive in them: He hath one property more then a Horse, for where∣as the Stones weares out their shooes, his shooes weares out the Stones; he has the virtue of confidence, and is not nice of company: Provided there be eating, for he sayes, of <HI>Idlenesse comes no goodnesse,</HI> and there∣fore had rather exercise his Teeth then his Tongue: His company (tis confest) is more costly then a Whores, and for your avoiding it, Reader, I commend the ensu∣ing Chapters of his atchivements to your approbation, as∣suring you, that nothing is set down in them, but what he hath truly acted, and so to the variety of them I leave thee.</P>

By this time the Wonder was over, and the Beefe wrought to the bones, the Gentleman smiling, asked if there were any more meate in the house, for he had eate nothing, Yes said the fellow that waited, there is a cold Capon: Oh let us have it by all meanes quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> no meate so excellent as a cold Capon, why then said his Client (and smiled) let's have it, <HI>You shall not starve in a Cooks shop Mr.</HI> Marriot; your Cause shall fare the better for it quoth <HI>Marriot.</HI> Will you have any Sauce quoth the fellow, Sauce to a cold Capon (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) away you Rascall, <HI>Hunger is the best sauce when all is done.</HI> I protest Sir (quoth his Cli∣ent) you have an excellent faculty, I Sir (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) I would you had so good a stomack, so would not I (replyed his Client) for I should starve my Wife and Children then.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How</HI> Marriot <HI>having his Motion granted, urged his Client to goe to dinner, and what happened.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MArriot,</HI> though a Man of weake Judgement, yet of strong Lungs, bellowed so loud at the Barre, that to be rid of him the Judges opened their eares (I cannot say their un∣derstanding) and granted his Motion: Upon which <HI>Marriot</HI> hol∣lowed forth in open Court, Blessing on the Judges, and keep them in this mind ever. Now (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI> to his Client) what thinke you? have I not friends? yes, and good ones too you see, but what say you to a Dinner
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Marriot <HI>not in Commons.</HI></NOTE>? 'tis that time a day (for he was too dan∣gerous a person to be admitted into Commons among the rest of his Function:) why (replied his Client) are you ready for a Dinner that made but now so stout a Breakfast? Ready
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Marriot <HI>ne∣ver unprepa∣red.</HI></NOTE> and ready again (quoth <HI>Marriot.</HI>) Alas Sir, Meate quickly disgests with men of my Calling, I have walked since, and talked since; and spent my Spirits in your Cause, a Noble refreshment will be very seasonable. Hark you Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> (quoth his Client) your Motions are very chargeable, are all your Clients at the cost to finde you meate and money too? Yes, yes, quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> some meate and some money does well, but you will have <HI>all and sum</HI> where ever you come Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> quoth his Client. I take lesse fees for my Motions (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) then any Man in Towne, but you take more meate then will serve three∣score quoth his Client, and laughed heartily. Alas Sir, (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) my belly is not so deepe but it may be filled; marry and I will try that (quoth his client) if all the meate in <HI>Westminster</HI> will do it: And so his Client being resolved to fathom his ungodly Paunch, carryed him to the house where they breakfasted; but hee having made there so great a slaughter in the morning, that they were un∣prepared to meet his Noons Encounter; but very civilly the wo∣man of the house told him (being a good customer) that if he plea∣sed to say what he would have, it should be drest in a trice: No quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> my Stomack is up, and I must have something pre∣sently to appease it, or my whole frame will be out of order, and so he marched into Kings street with a Stomack of no small growth, in so short a time, where, having searched every Cooks shop, that had a fit appearance to receive his Client (though a stye would serve him) and finding Provision fall short of Expectation, all being spent before, <HI>Marriot</HI> began to <HI>rave,</HI> and swore the People had a <HI>minde to starve him.</HI> At last, searching for his Prey
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is, whom he may devour.</NOTE>, espyed on his left hand
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>towards the three Tuns Tavern, a Dirty Tray full of dirtier
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Draffe is good enough for Swine.</NOTE> meat of all sorts, such as had endured the sury of the fire at least a dozen times, and been drowned in Greace as often: The house, or rather a Den,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The house de∣scribed.</NOTE> out of which came a smoak able to choake a horse, and cer∣tainly from the time of its building never had been befriended with Sun. The Cook himself of grisly hue, appeared as though he had bin bred up in <HI>Pluto's</HI> Kitchin: His <HI>Maudlin,</HI> or <HI>Shee-thing,</HI> of like com∣plexion, with an Apron of perfect Sluttery, and of countenance able (a Man would think) to overcome the most resolure and strongest appetite. Yet <HI>Marriot</HI> no whit daunted, encouraged his Client to step over, saying, <HI>See Sir, where the hand of Providence ha's dire∣cted us, I protest I began to faint.</HI> His Client perceiving his gastly countenance, fearing he would eate him if he were kept longer from meate, resolved to endure the Plague of the house, rather then suf∣fer by his tyrannous Jawes, and so with Nose not <HI>Scent-free,</HI> he en∣ters the inchanted Castle, with Giantick <HI>Marriot; Marriot</HI> poyses the Tray, and finds it answerable to his Stomack, quoth he, friend, what wilt thou take for as much meate as I can eate, this Gentleman is not at this time for eating: Why, Sir, (quoth the fellow) one of these pieces will serve two men, and you shall dine on one of them for twelve pence: No quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> I am a Gentleman, and will not be confin'd to one Dish, I must take here a bit and there a bit; troth I feare (quoth the fellow) it will spoile the fale of them, but if if you please to give me three shillings, you shall make your meale on them; thou art an honest fellow (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) and shalt have it: So up they went to a Roome where no light had ever been seen, save Candle-light, and stunck worse then the Shambles Excre∣ments, or the Bear-garden. His Client not able to endure their na∣sty accommodation, would have departed, and at the Bell Tavern have stayed for him: but <HI>Marriot</HI> would not permit it, saying, <HI>Sola∣men miseris socios habuisse doloris.</HI> Up came the meate, not ordered in severall Dishes, but clapt together in the Tray, as it stood upon the Stall; but whether it was to blunt the edg of his Stomack, or for want of dishes, is disputable; but <HI>Marriot</HI> to shew he feared no colours

The fellow
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Fearing nei∣ther God nor Devill.</NOTE> ranne up stairs, but before hee came, <HI>Marriot</HI> had made an end of two of them, and was ready to fall upon the other: You Dogg quoth the
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>fellow, and seized on the Tray and the remaining piece of meate; You Rascall quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> give me the meate: Sirrah (quoth the fellow) beest thou the Devill or his Dam, I will have money for the meate thou hast eaten, <HI>Maudlin</HI> fetch me a Constable, at which his Client was ready to burst with laughter, you Knave (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) I will not give thee a penny till I have had my bargain, you shall know sirrah who I am, and that I will straight quoth the fellow, and at him he flies, Sir (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) bear witnesse, I am a Lawyer, the Devil's in the Lawyer then (quoth the fellow) and I will beate him out of thee: Down falls <HI>Marriot,</HI> his Client not able to endure longer, makes his way towards the stairs, thinking to make up the sportby his leaving them; but the stairs being dark, downe tumbles his Clyent, in comes <HI>Maudlin</HI> with the Constable, the Constable sei∣zes on the Gentleman, immediately <HI>Marriot</HI> was heard to cry out, the Constable secured the Gentleman, and then went up, where he found <HI>Marriot's</HI> hat off, his Gowne over his Ears
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note the An∣tiquity of them.</NOTE>, and his Blew bree∣ches discovered, Blesse me quoth the Constable, what have we here? A distressed Gentleman (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) thou lyest (quoth the fel∣low) thou art no Gentleman,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">His Gentility questioned.</NOTE> for if thou wert thou wouldst pay me for my meat; sirrah sirrah quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> thou art a Knave, I will make thee stand to thy bargain, thou shalt be hang'd first, and at him he flies againe: come, cries the Constable, a Justice of Peace shall end this difference, with all my heart quoth the fellow, and mine too (quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI>) I can shew my face where thou darest not thine. So downe the Constable had them, to goe before the Justice, but his Client being unwilling to appeare further in the businesse, offered to pay the fellow for his meate: As I am a Christian (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) but you shall not, I will have out my bargain, or I will not pay him a penny for his meate. What was the bargain, quoth the Constable, I was to make a meale on his meate (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) for three shillings, and he has eaten me five pieces (quoth the fel∣low) as bigge
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">He shews the piece.</NOTE> as this, and would have this too. The Constable laughed heartily, and told <HI>Marriot</HI> it was a shamefull thing, and most unreasonable. I am a Lawyer (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) and know 'tis no shamefull thing for a Man to eate his

Sirrah (quoth the fel∣low) it was none of thine, I will be paid for it, and so to a Justice they went: The Constable there opened the matter to the Justice, <HI>Marriot</HI> pleaded his bargain, the Fellow made his defence, and said, he thought he had bargained with a <HI>Man,</HI> but he proved a <HI>Monster,</HI> It is all one for that (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) a bargain is a bargain, and I will have right if there be any Justice
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">As though he doubted it.</NOTE> in the Kingdom. The Justice (being of <HI>Gotam</HI> breed) checkt the fellow, &amp; told him that a bargain was a bargain,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Every foole can speak as he is taught.</NOTE> and he would recover it against him, and therefore ordered the fellow (for preventing his future trouble) to restore <HI>Mar∣riot</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>the other piece of meate, and to take his three shillings for full satisfaction. Well (quoth the fellow) if it must be so, hee shall eate it in my sight, and the Devill doe him good with it: Good reason too, quoth the Justice, but not in my house (quoth the fellow) I'le see him hangd first: I care not where I eate it (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) and yet I'le eate it where I please: Not so neither quoth the Justice, you must eate it where the bargain was made. Oh good your Worship (quoth the fellow) punish me not so, unlesse you Order him to call for drink proportionable: Well Sir, (quoth the Justice) give him twelve pence more, and eate it where you please Sir, I'le eate it in the street first quoth <HI>Marriot;</HI> away, away, quoth his Client, it shall be so, we but trespasse upon this Gentlemans patience, friend deliver him his bargaine, and thou shalt have foure shillings, that's twelve pence more then my bargain (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) it goes neer my heart to give it him. They departed from the Justices, and returned to the Cooks Cell-doore, for into it he was not to be admitted, the meate was brought forth, the money paid, and <HI>Marriot</HI> put the meat in his sleeve
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">'Twas not the first time he had done so.</NOTE>: Sirrah sirrah, quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> I shall know you for a Knave hereafter, and shun thy house as I would a Prison.

The Gentlemen having had mirth sufficient with him, lets loose his Wrist; which no sooner done, but <HI>Marriot</HI> takes his run as fast as his heavy heels could carry him, At which all the People gave a shout, and the boyes after him. At last <HI>Marriot</HI> reached the place appointed, where he was no sooner entered, but he comes first in the Kitchin, and finding his Deten∣tion had wronged him much, the last Course being ready to goe in,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>fell upon a bowle of cold Creame that stood on the Dresser, and di∣spatched it in the twinkling of a Gloworm. The last Course going in, he enters with it, and there to the Gentlemen he relates the rea∣son of his stay. Alack (quoth the Gentlemen) you have done your selfe a great deale of wrong, Mr. <HI>Marriot,</HI> and us too. Nay quoth Mr. <HI>Marriot,</HI> I have not done it, but the Knaves that held me in the Street, but I hope I shall recover the time I have lost to all your Contents, and so fell on a dozen of Pigeons, and a leaze of suck∣ing Rabbets; which having devoured (to the wonder of the behol∣ders) quoth he, Gentlemen, I doe not like this pidling dishes, have you no substantiall Beefe or Mutton left in the house, and so what was remaining, was brought in, which he as easily destroyed as the other, and was ready for more: But <HI>Marriot</HI> being over-heated with coming, and falling first on the cold Cream, and drinking sudden∣ly after it, found such quarrelling in his Guts, that he was unable to sit longer at Table, and before he could get from thence, shewed some testimony of his loose Condition, to the prejudice of all their Noses there present. His Vocative case made the Gentlemen weary of his Company; and finding him worse and worse, they caused a Porter to be called for, and bargained with him to lead him to his Lodging; but before the Porter got halfe way, he was so strong of Monsieur Sir Reverence, that he was not to be endured. The Por∣ter espying a fellow with a Wheelbarrow, called him, and told him the Gentleman was sick, and if he would carry him home, he would be very well paid for his paines, for hee was a Person of Quality. The fellow with hopes of profit, was armed against Senior <HI>le Faugh,</HI> and takes him in, and carries his Worship, but see his fate! he was unhappily carried that way where the Gentlemen had made sport with him in the Morning, so that the Shop-keepers and Boys, espy∣ing him in that case, ran out and cryed, The great Eater has over∣eaten himself; to whom <HI>Marriot</HI> stil cryed, good Christians forbear, and do not mocke a dying man, ha quoth the Boyes, This is the great Eater of <HI>Grays Inne:</HI> A pox upon you quoth the Wheelbarrow fellow, art thou the Cormorant? I would have seen you hang'd (had I knowne so much) before you should have come into my Barrow; Out, out, in the Devils Name, it is no charity to preserve thy life: And so out poor <HI>Marriot</HI> was thrown in a pittifull pickle; oh quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> is there no Christian-minded People among you? At last two women Tankerd-bearers, took pitty of him, had him into a house, and washed him, and at Night was led to his Lodging, where he was no sooner sate downe, but he was taken as though he had quick silver in his guts, and nothing would satisfie him but a Doctor, who almost as soon as sent for, came. Alas (quoth the Doctor) Mr. <HI>Mar∣riot,</HI> you have taken a surfeit with eating too much; fye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye (quoth
<PB N="9" REF="7"/><HI>Marriot</HI>) Sir, you are mistaken, I could have eaten thrice as much: You must take a Purge quoth the Doctor, I purge too much alrea∣dy quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> I quoth the Doctor, but this proceeds from the malignity of the Cause, the effect of which being taken away, this purging ceaseth. Say you so Sir (quoth <HI>Marriot</HI>) pray use me well, and let me have it as soone as possible, you shall have it made ready to night (quoth the Doctor) fit to take to morrow, I shall dye before quoth <HI>Marriot;</HI> why then quoth the Doctor, you shall have it to take to night, and so went his wayes to make ready the Purge, which being finished, <HI>Marriot</HI> received, and a while before he went to bed, tooke it; about two hours after his being abed, it began to work, and at last he felt a long thing come from him, at sight whereof hee cryed out, oh the Devil, the Devil, whereupon all the house was di∣sturbed. The Doctor was sent for, who, when he saw the Worme, told him that it was a Worme that had long time bred in his body, and would have come to a more perfect growth, had not that acci∣dent of eating the cold Creame (which is an Enemie to those kinde of Wormes) and drinking suddenly after it, curdled it, and so suffo∣cated and killed the Worme; for which resolvement, Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> gave him not only thanks, but payed him for his Purge, and to this day keeps the Worme (dryed up) in his Chamber, which was then about three yards long. But it is conceived by the Wise, that it left behind at that time, young ones, which are grown to a greater big∣nesse, as may appeare by the growth of his Stomack, but whether it be or not, Time and such another Surfeit will produce, and untill which time you must have patience.</P>

My Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> sends for a Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber to shave all the haire off his beard; which being done, they got a large loose Gowne, and pulled off his owne Cloaths, and put the Gowne on him, with Head-cloaths and Apron, dressing him like a Bawd. <HI>Mar∣riot</HI> being so drunk that he knew not what they did, was in this shape led to the Coach, and thence he was carried to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> where being conveyed to a Chamber, through which the Bishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI> was to passe, they let him in a Chaire, and left him; The Arch-Bishop coming through the roome, starts at the sight of him, saying to his Gentleman-Usher, I do much wonder how this drunken Wo∣man should come here; <HI>Marriot</HI> being not full afleep, said, <HI>I</HI> am no Woman, <HI>I</HI> am a Man, and a Lawyer; the Bishop much wondring at him, assured himselfe that some body had put him in that place to affront him, and now begins to question <HI>Marriot,</HI> who for his part was not able to speak for himselfe: but my Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> stept into the roome, and ended the controversie, by sending <HI>Marriot</HI> away, telling the Bishop that he came so disguised only to aske pardon for his faults: The Bishop was angry at his saying, but could not helpe himselfe. My Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> gave <HI>Marriot</HI> a suite of Cloaths for his pains, which to this day, though greasie, are to be seen on his backe, and is very loath to leave them, for the very fancy of the pastimes he had in them.</P>

The Woman was scarce returned into the Shop, but <HI>Marriot</HI> had drunk up his single pot of Beere, eate two Rolls, and pickt the very bones of the Bacon, which had had but a small slice cut off it before: <HI>Marriot</HI> comes into the Shop, quoth he J have quickely done, so it seems Sir quoth shee; there is twelve pence for thy Bacon quoth he, J will come another time and be mer∣ry with thee: God blesse you Sir quoth she, and send you well to do, the woman not thinking he had eaten all, and being busied in her Shop, could not presently goe to see what spoile had been made, thought her self well paid, and <HI>Marriot</HI> went his ways into the Fare; but it so happened that <HI>Marriot</HI> came that way back, and the wo∣man having found out the Deceit, was cursing him deeply, and call∣ing him all the names that could be.

<HEAD>CHAP XX. <HI>How</HI> Marriot <HI>was privately Invited to a Supper in the City, which was appointed for the making of two Neighbours friends, which had formerly been at variance, and how he was discovered: And how both he and the rest of his Company were dismist without their expected Supper.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT happened that two Citizens of <HI>London</HI> had a falling out, whether it were for their own honesty or their Wives, I know not, which I shall not here question; but by some Neighbours they were advised to put it to Arbitration, each man was to choose two sufficient men in the Parish, to end this Controversie, rather then to go to Law to spend much Money on both sides, and neither the Gainer; all partyes are agreed to put it to Arbitration, which accordingly was done; and he who was supposed to have done the wrong, was by these learned men, judged to give the party wrong∣ed, a Supper for himselfe and his Friend; the time and place was appointed, and all are Friends again.</P>
<P>Yet he who had received the wrong, and not well pleased with the Result of the Arbitration, still retained an inward Grudge, though he seemingly carryed a faire out-side to the other, and did study how to vex him: at last he thought, that if he could get Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> with him, hee should be sufficiently revenged on him: for he knew that his Stomack was able to undo two such house∣keepers as he was, might he have but a full Table continually, he
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>presently sent for Mr. <HI>Marriot,</HI> and gave him the whole circumstances of the businesse, and declared the cause of his sending for him, which was this.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Marriot,</HI> there hath lately been some fallings out, betwixt one of my Neighbours and my selfe, wherein I have received much Damage and Wrong, the Particulars thereof will be too long to recount unto you, and keep you from hearing that, which you sus∣pect to be the occasion of my sending for you at this time, you shall go as my Friend, and at the Supper I wish you to feed heartily, for it will be a great satisfaction to me, to see him vex at the spoyle of his meate; do you think that your Stomack is able now to give a finishing stroake to the meate that shall be brought to the Table: when <HI>Marriot</HI> heard this, his solid Countenance changed into a smile, thinking himselfe halfe at supper already, saying, Sir, I am so well prepared for such an Encounter, that had I fasted a Week, I could not have a better Stomack then now I have: for were there more meate then I guesse there is, I durst attempt it all my selfe: Bravely spoken Mr. <HI>Marriot,</HI> you shall be my only Champion in this businesse, and <HI>I</HI> dout not but that we shall remain Conquerours in our Enterprise.</P>
<P><HI>Marriot</HI> who for such a businesse needed not to be much intreated: but streight way Harnessed himselfe, and a long with the Messenger he goes; being now come to the Citizens house, he was better in∣structed of the matter, and away they go to the place where they should have their Supper, being come, they were led into a faire Room where the Cloath was laid, Bread and Salt on the Table, and other necessaryes on a side Cubboard: <HI>Marriot</HI> heard the <HI>Jack</HI> go, but as yet had not smelt the meate; his Stomack being raw, fell upon a French Roule to appease the waterish Humours that did trouble him: But the meate staying something long, caused <HI>Marriot</HI> to eate all the rest of the Bread that was on the Table; the Master of the house came up to welcome the Gentlemen, but when he saw the Salt stand on the Table and no Bread by it, knocked for his Servant to come up, being come, he said, Is there no Bread to set on the Table, Sir, said the Servant; I brought six french Roules up and set them on the board, Sir, said <HI>Marriot,</HI> you need inquire no further for them, for being hot with walking, I love to eate a Crust, then said the Master it is well enough, calling the Maid, whispered in her Eare, that she should carry the meate to a Neighbours house, and that he would be there presently, for quoth he, here is the great Eater of <HI>Grayes-Inne,</HI> who will make no more of this Supper, then a Plow-man would do of a poached Egg: When the Servant was gone, the Master of the
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>house said to him who was his Adversary, Sir, I alwayes had a suspition of you, by reason of your equivocating, is this
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pointing to Mr.</HI> Marriot.</NOTE> a fit man to be brought to an honest mans Table; away, away, you get no Supper here, for I will entertain no such belly-Gods at my Table: Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> marched up towards him, saying, Sir, I desire to be acommodated as well as any other Gentleman, but your ill bred Citizens have no more manners then a Horse, and do not know when they are in the presence of a Gentleman how to behave them∣selves: I would have you to know Sir, that many Lords and Knights are glad of my Company, and are you so nice; Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> said the Citizen, They have money enough, and send for you only to make them sport, my Purse will not reach the pastime, there∣fore whilst tis time, go seek your Supper, for you get none here; when <HI>Marriot</HI> heard this Sentance past on his Belly, like a Beare bereaved of her Whelps, stormed, and went down the Staires, as if a Water-Mill had been going; you may conceive the Door was not shut against him, but rather set wide open, to let out him and his <HI>stomack,</HI> which otherwise might have been the distruction of more Meat then many a Butcher kills in a <HI>Week,</HI> had it been there drest, his <HI>Stomack</HI> was then at such a height: but <HI>Marriots</HI> Friend came down, and with the best words he could use desired his pati∣ence, and for to stop both his Mouth and his Belly, had him to an Ale-house, and gave him nine two penny loaves and two pound of <HI>Suffolk Cheese,</HI> which for the present did allay the knawing of an∣other Worm which he hath in his Maw, his Friend promising him a better Collation when they met next, parted, and <HI>Marriot</HI> went heavily to his Lodging.</P>

Being come home he desired some water to set it on, which was done accordingly; it being now boyled, <HI>Marriot</HI> fell to, and quickly picked the bones, but he complained that it was very salt, but to put away the thought of drink out of his minde, went to bed, thinking that sleep would a pease his Drought, but it proved otherwise, for about Midnight he waked, thinking himselfe to be neer some great fire, by the rea∣son of the great heat he was in, started up and ran to his Window, crying out, fire, fire, murther, murther, at last his Land-Lord came up, asking him what was the matter, pray fetch me a Paile of wa∣ter quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> for the fire is only in my belly: so you have not fired my house, I do not care if it were in your — his Land-Lady brought him up a paile of water, which he poured into his boyling Caldron, to appease those humours which would have run into a further distemper if not quenched in time: but <HI>Marriot</HI> be∣gan to wish that the Doggs had eaten the Porke before he had seen it; but he said, if they had, a thousand to one but it had killed them, poor Creatures, and therefore I am glad I eate it my selfe: So de∣siring his Land-Lord not to take it ill that he knocked them up, at so unseasonable an houre, but his Land-Lord very civilly said, Mr. <HI>Marriot, we are all ready at your knock,</HI> if it please you to have any more water before we go to bed, it shall be fetched, no more said <HI>Marriot</HI> at this time; so laying him down, slept more quietly then before, his Land-Lord also went to bed, and did think because Porke had so fired his Maw, that he would never love swines flesh again: but he proved no <HI>Jew,</HI> for he was at Bacon the next day.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper nought for the Pox.</NOTE> with an ounce of Pepper, for he scares no pox, as many Turnups as will fill the Pot, when he had layd all these in his Pot, he put there∣to a Gallon of Pumpe water, because it should not want moisture, then with his owne pawes he carryes it to the Bake-house, staying still by it, fearing least he should be deprived of some of it in his absence.</P>
<P>He never goes to Church on a Sunday, but gives much atten∣tion to the Baker when he sayes it is time to draw, which time being come, he carries his Pot home, and to Dinner he goes without lay∣ing a Cloath,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He buyes no new Bread.</NOTE> first he cuts slyces of stale Bread and sops them in this Restorative: He is a right English man, for he eates his Broath first, which being done, he sends the meat to be boyled once more in his hot Maw, which hath so quick a digestion, that three Cookes are not able to provide him meat at all the motions of his Stomack: This being an absolute remedy for the present, I have here set it downe for those Stomacks that dare keep him company.</P>

<P>The use he made of this broath and fish, was only as I conceive to get him a stomack, for he would often say, That fish was of a light digestion: therefore good for those that have but a slight stomack at present, but desire a greater,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>To make his cooling Sallet, to coole the Blood.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am of opinion that he hath read <HI>Gerards</HI> Herball, or the Hi∣story of Plants, wherein partly he found this Receit, but be∣ing inlarged by himselfe, I thought fit to set it downe amongst the rest; he being a man of a hot Stomack, did use this Sallet following very often, wherein he found great benefit,</P>
<P><HI>The way to make it is thus,</HI></P>
<P>Take as many Water-Cresses as a large Flasket will hold, as many Radish tops, and halfe so many Colworts, boyle all these together for the space of two houres,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">You may bor∣row his Cal∣dron.</NOTE> then take them up without much squeizing, and put them in a halfe Tubb, putting thereto a Gallon of soure Ale, and a quantity of Goose-grease, sufficient to give it a taste, with a pound of Pepper strewed upon it: This Sallet is excellent good to purge the blood, and to loosen the bel∣ly, this quantity being taken three severall mornings in the weeke.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII <HI>How to make Mr.</HI> Marriots <HI>new Dish, called a</HI> Frigazee.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MARRIOT</HI> hearing of a new Dish that was much used at <HI>Oxford Cates,</HI> and in other places about the City amongst Gallants, thought in his fansie to make one that should resemble it, because the materialls that were used in it, were too deer for him, but being a man of a rare Stomack, quickly guessed at something that was eatable, though dressed in a strange way; when he had thought upon all the materials of this Dish, he be∣gan to put it in practice, having gotten all the Ingredients toge∣ther, to try this rare conclusion.</P>
<P><HI>And thus he made it.</HI></P>
<P>He took three great Pomcitrons and pulled out the Curnels that were within them, then he pared the outside rinde off, and then slyced them into thinn slyces, then he had many Apples which he slyced also, then he took two Bullocks Livers and slyced them ve∣ry thinn and broad, then he layd a row of the former slyces in the bottome of his Oxe-cheek-pot, he peppered his Liver well, and layd a laying of one and a laying of another, till he had filled his Pott, strowing many fine hearbs on the top of it, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carryed it to the Bake-house, where he stayd till it was baked; being come home, he invited his Landlord to taste of his new Dish, who I dare sware never saw the like before, but his Landlord knowing his Stomack, and that a — was as good for a Sow as a Pancake, praysed his Dish highly, saying, It is very good, but I have newly supped, therefore I desire you to excuse me to night, I shall leave none for to morrow, quoth <HI>Marriot,</HI> therefore stand to it now that you may say you have eaten of a rare Dish, he not being over nice eate a bit or two with him, but I will not tell how sick it made the poore old man, but it agreed with Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> as if it had beene a Chicken roasted, and served in to his Table with Butter and Parse∣ley, so excellent is his Stomack for digestion.</P>
