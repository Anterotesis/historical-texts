<HEAD>The First Demonstration.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which <HI>The East-side of</HI> England, <HI>and</HI> Schotland, <HI>is shewed, from the River of</HI> London, <HI>to the</HI> New-Castle.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y two wayes men may saile into the River of <HI>London:</HI> from the southwards, along by the North Forland, and by the northwards along by the Naes. if you will saile in there from the Southwards, then you must first shun the North Forland, it is there showld a good wayes from the shore, bring the north For∣land also not more southerly from you then southwest, that you do not run on against the North-grounds, which lye farre to seawards. Coming by the land, run alongst by it, but come not so neere it, that you leese sight of the spire of the steeple of <HI>Margat</HI> behind the land, for then you should come too neere it; but if you keep so far from the shore, that you can see the foresaid steeple above the high land, or keep it even in your sight, then you cannot take hurt of the south grounds. Coming thwart of <HI>Margat,</HI> then you are past the foresaid showlds or south grounds. Run then boldly
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>towards the shore, and within two cables lengths along by it, for to avoid the north grounds, which lye farre to the southwards towards the land. Saile on so west all along by the shore, untill that the Roculvers (which are two steeples upon one Church) come one in the other, and then you shall run in sight of the first boy upon the Lasts, which by e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h upon the to resaid marks of the Roculvey a be∣ing by it you can also see the other boy which lyeth like as the first also on the north side, and over against it on the south side standeth a Beak on, there you must saile through betwixt them both, leaving the boy on the starboard side, and the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akon over against it on the larboard side. From thence you may with little ships, or ships of little draught, but not with ships of great draught, at high water run o∣ver the Swallow on west-north-west toward, Sheppy, for it is there showld water, with ships of great draught you must run through the Fishers deep towards Black tayle. You may also run from Margat with small ships along by the shore upon the lead at high water, even unto Sheppy, but in sailing along there you must cast your tides well, for the flood falleth very strong into the Swallow, and the ebbe to the contrary very strong out.</P>
<P>When you come by Sheppy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheppy.</NOTE> run within two cables lengths along by it, for to avoid the taile of the Spaniard, untill that you be past Quinsborough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spag∣mard.</NOTE> edge then off from the south shore for to avoid the Noere, which is a sand that shooteth off from the River a good wayes to the east∣wards, upon the outermost end whereof standeth alwayes a Beakon whereby you may know it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Noete.</NOTE> run along to the northwards of it, leaving on the larboard side, and along in the middle of the channell into the sea-reach for to a∣void the grounds which lye off from the north shore, goe in so along towards Gravesend.</P>
<P>To sail with ships of great draughts along by the north For land up into the Thames, you must (when you are past the buyes upon the Lasts) sail through the Fishers deep toward Blacktaile, which lyeth from the second buye upon the Lasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishers deep.</NOTE> unto the first buye in the Fishers deep,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>northwest, and northwest, and by west, which lyeth upon the north fide of the sand, which men doe call the Spani∣ard, these two buyes lye a great way one from the other.</P>
<P>Sailing from the buye upon the Lasts, it is a great way, all showld water, so that you must run over there with high water, but coming near the buye upon the Spaniard, it is by little and little, deeper water. He that will saile o∣ver here, must reckon his tides well, the flood falleth there along towards the southwest almost thwart over the deep, and the ebbe to the contrary.</P>
<P>The second buye in the Fishers Deep you must leave on the starboard side: being past that, you come against the Blacktaile, to the southwards of the Shoebeakon into the right deep. The east poynt of Sheppy shall then lye about south from you. From the Shoe-beakon the course is southwest to the point of Blacktaile, there runneth off a hook which men might (at unawares) sail within (co∣ming from the northwards) in five or six fathom, but if you keep from the shore in seven fathom, you cannot saile within it. From Black-tail to the Beakon upon the Noere, the course is west-south-west, leave it on the larboard side, as before is said, and run it along the River, in the middle of the Channel betwixt both lands unto Graves∣end.</P>
<P>For to saile into the River of London coming from. the northwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail in∣to the River of <HI>Lond:</HI> from the north∣wards.</NOTE> you must come neer the coast to the north∣wards of Orfordnes, which is to the northwards of all the sands, there lye Albrough, Dunwich, Walderswike, Sowle and Covehit, all betwixt Orfordnes and Leystaf. Covehit is a sharp steeple like as also Leystaffe, but Sowle and Wal∣derswyke, Albrough and Orfordnes, are all flat Steeples, Sowle and Dunwich lye both upon the high land, betwixt them both is a valley, therein you may see Walderswike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sowle.</NOTE>when you are thwart of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunwich.</NOTE> Dunwich is the best to be known of all these foresaid places: it hath two flat steeples, and on both sides some trees. To the soutwards of it lyeth Al∣brough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Albrough.</NOTE>which is also very good to be known, it hath one high flat steeple with three mils, the two stand to the
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>northwards, and the third to the southwards of Arbrough when you are thwart of it, but sailing to the southwards, they come all three to the southwards of it. The Land without Albrough, and to the southwards of it is very low, flat and chindely land.</P>
<P>Betwixt Albrough and Dunwich, about half wayes be∣twixt them, lyeth a wood, which is at both ends high, and in the middest low with a saddle; this you shall common∣ly see first when you fall with land thereabouts, and is the best to be known for to know the coast by; the land with∣out it, and to the southwards, is very low flat chindely land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orfordnes.</NOTE> About two leagues to the soutwards of Albrough lyeth Orfordnes, betwixt them both stand also two woods of trees, which shew themselves a far off like Castles or Towers. Or fordnes is a flat steeple with a thick or broad castle, which hath also a thick flat steeple, almost of fashion like the steeple of Rarop, open above with holes in it like Bellholes.</P>
<P>Before Dunwich you may anker, there is good lying in eight or nine fathom somwhat soft ground. Before Al∣brough is the best road of all the coasts thereabouts, in six and seven fathom.</P>
<P>East from Albrough about two leagues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelbrough Knock.</NOTE> lyeth Albrough Knock, this is a sand which at low water is not deeper then seven or eight foot: you may sound round about in five fathom, but it is not good to come nearer it: with sea winds you may discern it plainly, by the breaking of the sea upon it; but with landerly or westerly winds, and fair weather, the sea breaketh not upon it; he that runneth thereby to the northwards with an ebb, shall see it com∣monly ripple very much upon it, like as upon most the English bancks, and not indeed upon the bancks, but a∣gainst them, for upon the showlds or middest of the banks is the smoothest water, like as you find every where.</P>
<P>VVhen as Albrough is west from you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of Ael∣brough Knock.</NOTE> and the two stee∣ples of Orfordnes are one in the other, there you shall find Albrough knock.</P>
<P>These are sure marks of that Sand.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<P> The Whiting, or Whiting sand, is somewhat a long small sand lying before Orfordnes, and the chindely land to the southwards of Aelbrough, and lyeth along the reach, but the south end lyeth further from land then the north end, there is at low water not above six or seaven foot water upon it. Coming from the northwards, men saile commonly to the westwards of it, that is through betwixt the land and Whiting-sand, towards the Naze.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whiting sand.</NOTE>Men may also saile along to the eastwards of it, through betwixt Whiting-sand and the eastermost poynt of the Court, or Court-sand, which some doe call the Rib.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court.</NOTE></P>
<P>The north end of the Whiting lyeth along close to the shore, and lyeth from the steeples of Orfordnes southeast and by south, it is so exceeding steep and needle too, that you shall have the one cast nine, the next cast five fathom, and then you are no more but a ships length from it, be∣fore you can heave the lead againe you shall be upon it. When you sit with the foreship against it, it is at the stern five or six fathom deep.</P>
<P>Along the inner side it is also every where so steep, that you cannot sound it, but on the outer side you may run along by it in five fathom upon the lead, untill you come within the sands.</P>
<P>When as you come from the northwards and will saile through within the Whiting, you must run close by the shoare, and south w. about by the poynt of the chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dle to the southwards of Aelbrough, untill you come within the north poynt of the Whiting, when the steeples of Or∣fordnes come to be north-west and by north from you, then you are right thwart of the north poynt of the Whi∣ting, being within it goe againe more southerly, to wit, southwest and by south towards Balsy cliffe.</P>
<P>If you should fall to the southwards of Whiting, or els coming from the southwards will saile in there to the northwards, then bring the steeples of Orfordnes west∣northwest, or northwest and by west, but for all not more northerly then north-west from you, and saile so right in untill you come by the Chindle strand, then run in a∣long
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>by it, as is before said, and then you shall run far e∣nough along to the northwards of the Whiting.</P>
<P>If you will saile in to the eastwards or the southwards of the Whiting, then bring the steeples of Orfordnes north north-west, or north-west and by north, or northwest from you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to run in to the east∣wards of the Whiting.</NOTE> and saile in so right with them, untill that the wood of trees, that standeth upon the next poynt to the south-wards of Balsy cliffe, come to Balsy cliffe, which shall then stand about west-southwest from you, keep that aforesaid wood to the southside of the cliffe, and saile in boldly right with it, and then you shall run right in the the faire-way in betwixt the Whiting, and the tayle of Court-sand, but if you bring the foresaid trees more then a hand-spikes length without the cliffe, you shall not fail to run on against the poynt of the Court. That afore∣said wood of trees is very good to be knowne, because thereabouts stand no other trees.</P>
<P>Or bring the steeple of Balsy w. s. w. from you, and saile in so right with it, until you come by Whiting sand, in five or six fathom, and lead it in so by it upon the lead, untill that you come by Balsy, or that you get deeper water.</P>
<P>When you come near Balsy, whether you be come in from the northwards, or the southwards of Whiting sand, you must keep somewhat off from the shore, because of a little riffe, or small tayle, that shooteth off from the shore, thwart of Balsy-cliffe, which you must avoid somewhat, with ships of great draughts, there remaineth at low wa∣ter upon it no more then two fathome, you may com∣monly perceive it well by the rippling of the tide.</P>
<P>You may also saile in to the southwards of the Ribb, (that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail in at the channel through the Court.</NOTE> the taile of the Court, or Court-sand) thus, bring the steeple of Balsy north north w. or a little more north∣erly from you, and saile in so right with it, and so you shall run in to the northwards, or through the Court, at a channell of eight fathome depth, the east side of this channell is steep, come no nearer it then eight fathome, but by the west side you may run in about by the Court,
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>upon the lead, untill you come within the sands.</P>
<P>Balsy hath a high flat steeple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balsy.</NOTE> and lyeth somwhat with∣in the land behind the cliffe, when as you come from the northwards, you may see Balsy to the northwards, or the westwards of the cliffe, but you saile it altogether behind the cliffe, so that at last it cometh out againe to the south∣wards of it.</P>
<P>If you will saile to Harwich being past Balsy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail in∣to Harwich.</NOTE> then bring Balsy to that steep point to the southwards of Bal∣sy, where trees stand upon, keep these marks so standing, and run so along by the shoare, untill that you be over the point of the Chindle, the marks thereof are two high trees within the land, when they are about N. n. west from you, then they come one in the other with the steeple of Harwich, and then you are right over the poynt of the Chindle, and then you shall get deeper water, four and five fathome, or somewhat more against the highest water. Run in then about by the poynt, the channell ly∣eth in right N. but in the middest of the Havens mouth lyes a suncken rocky and stony ground, which you must avoid, you may saile in about it on both sides, by the one shore or the other, but along by the east shore it is best, be∣ing within it, you cannot saile amisse, to take hurt, if you doe not saile bluntly against the shore, there you may ankor all over, where you please, before the Towne, in five, six, and seven fathom. You may well also goe fur∣ther into the bight, there it is clean every where. The fara∣way betwixt Orfordnes or Whiting-sand, and the Naze lyeth most s. w. and by s. and is six, seven, and eight fa∣thom deep, in turning to windwards you may run to the shore in five and four fathom, but close to the sands it is deeper, to wit, eight, nine, and ten fathom, the nearer the sands, the deeper water.</P>
<P>But to saile from Balsy to the Naze,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Naze.</NOTE> you must mark the steeple of Balsy, when it cometh within a Capstone-bars length neare to the s. end of the cliffe, then keep them so standing, so long untill that the house upon the Maze come over the two fields, which lye on against the High∣land,
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>or come over a black head upon the sea-side, saile then right in with them, untill that the steeple of Har∣wich come to be n. n. w. from you in the little valley of a red cliffe, leave then the first marks, keep the steeple of Harwich in that little valley, and goe on s. s. e. untill that the third poynt of the Naze come without the two other poynts, so you shall run through betwixt the Naze and the Course, there remaineth at low water no more then eight, ten, and at some places twelve foot water, therefore it is not good to run through here, unlesse that it be a quarter flood, or with a ship of great draught at halfe flood, there it is very uneven of ground, rocky and stony. The poynt of the Naze is very foule, and uneven, the nearer the shoare thwart of that poynt the showlder, but the nearer the sands the deeper.</P>
<P>When that the third poynt of the Naze cometh with∣out the two other poynts, or the other land, and that it doth againe begin to deep off, to wit, four or five fathom, then goe southest somewhat southerly, or southwest and by south, unto the bye upon Longsand. Thwart of the Naze is Long-sand very steep, so that it cannot be well sounded with the lead by them that are not there very well acquainted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Longsand.</NOTE> but somwhat more to the southwards you may run along by it in four fathom, and three fathom and a halfe, untill that you get the buy upon Longsand in sight of you. The n. shore to the southwards of the Naze is also flat, you may run along by it also upon the lead, without any danger.</P>
<P>The buy upon the Longsand lyeth in two fathome and an halfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buyes upon Longsand &amp; the Spits.</NOTE> at halfe flood, you must leave it on the larboard side, and the Buye upon the Spits, on the starboard side, which lyeth a little showlder, they lye about south and be east, and north and by west, a musket shot one from the other. The Course betwixt the two buyes, is south-southeast, and northnorthwest, but you must reckon well your tids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spits.</NOTE> whether you run through there with a flood, or with an ebb. Upon the Spits betwixt the two buyes, is at halfe flood at least three fathom and a halfe, or al∣most
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>four fathome, in the right channell, a little to the southwards of the buy upon the Spits stand two masts a∣bove the water, of a lost ship, which are good marks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitakers Beakon.</NOTE> Be∣ing over the Spits, the course to Whitakers beakon is s. southwest.</P>
<P>About halfe way betwixt them stand also two masts more on the same w. side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Middle-plate.</NOTE> and over against these masts ly∣eth a middle plate, whereupon lyeth a buy on the west side: the fareway is along to the west-wards of this mid∣dle-plate, through betwixt that foresaid Buy, and the Maste.</P>
<P>To the northwards of that foresaid Middle-plate, go∣eth out a Channell by the south-side of Long-sand, which you may saile out and in, called the Kings deep. If you come from Whitakers-beakon, past the Middle-plate, so far that you get sight of the buyes of Long-sand, or Spits, goe then boldly e. n. e. and n. e. and by east into sea, or upon the lead along by Longsand, but if you should run into sea, to the s. wards of the Middle-plate, you should with an e. n. e. way saile within the Hook of the Mouse. This Kings-deep is a ready Channell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings deep.</NOTE> and is used almost forall ships for to run out at.</P>
<P>For to run in at this channell out of the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail in∣to the Kings deep.</NOTE> then bring the poynt of the Naze northwest from you, and saile in so with it, untill that you come near Goemfliet or Long∣sand in five fathome, goe in then along by it about west∣south west, and southwest and by west, and keepe the sounding of Long-sand, and so you shall not faile to run in sight of the buy upon the Spits, and the foresaid masts to the southwards of it.</P>
<P>From Whitakers beakon to the Shoebeakon the course is s. s. w. somewhat westerly, coming thwart of the Shoe∣beakon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shoe beakon.</NOTE>then lyeth the east poynt of Sheppy about s. from you. From the Shoebeakon the course is along s. w. to the poynt of Blacktaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blacktaile.</NOTE> there runneth off a Hook, which men might saile within, coming from the northwards, but if you keep from the shore in seven fathome, you can∣not take hurt of it, but in five fathome you run within it.
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>The like Hook is also a little to the southwards of the Shoebeakon, which you might unawares saile within, co∣ming from the southwards.</P>
<P>From Blacktaile to the beakon upon the Nore, the course is w. s. w. The Nore is a sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nore.</NOTE> lying from the south poynt of the maine land of the River, far to the eastwards, therefore leave the beakon on the larboard side, and goe on west along amidst the channel, into the River, betwixt both the lands, as heretofore hath been said in the descrip∣tion of the Fishers deep.</P>
<P>From Aelbrough along by Dunwich to Covehit, the coast lyeth north and by east, somewhat easterly, and south and by west, or somewhat westerly five leagues, but from Covehit or Leystaf, north and south two leagues Ael∣brough, Dunwich and the sands lying thereabouts, are described here before.</P>
<P>Betwixt Dunwich and Covehit lyeth the Haven of Sowle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sowle.</NOTE> which is a little showld River, a little within it divideth it selfe into three parts, upon the northermost arm lyeth Sowle, upon the middlemost Walderswyke, and upon the souther most Dunwich.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunwich.</NOTE></P>
<P>Covehit hath a high sharp steeple, thwart of it lyeth a bank not far from land, which falleth at low water, but at halfe flood you may saile through betwixt it and the land in three fathome, upon the outer side it is very steep, so that you cannot come nearer it then nine or ten fa∣thome. When the steeple of Easton is westnorth west from you, then you are to the southwards of the bank, &amp; when the steeple of Covehit is s. w. and by w. from you, then you are to the northwards of it.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northward of Covehit lyeth Ley∣staf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leystaff,</NOTE>and two leagues more to the northwards of it lyeth Yarmouth. The steeple of Leystaf is a high sharp steeple, and standeth a great musket shot within the land from the houses, so that in sailing along you may bring the steeple on both sides of the houses. Off from Leystaf begin the bank or Holins of Yarmouth, &amp; lye along to the n. wards past Yarmouth, until thwart of Winterton there goe di∣vers
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>marks, for those that are there acquainted; you may saile through within these banks, off from Leystaf, untill past Winterton.</P>
<P>If you run through from before Leystaff within these banks, then look out for the fire-beakon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to come within the banks of Yar∣mouth.</NOTE> which stands by Leystaf, which at two little white houses, the one standeth beneath upon the chindle on the sea-side, and the inner∣most upon a little Hammock, somewhat further within the land. When they come to the southwards, they shew themselves to the northwards of the Towne, but come at last thwart of it. In the night there is alwayes fired upon them, for to saile in there also by night. Bring these fore∣said fire-beakons n. w. and by north, or somewhat more northerly from you, and saile in so right with them, ei∣ther by night or by day, the Church of Leystaf cometh then to the southwards of the Towne, over a Countrey House by the water side: when you come against the Channell, there is at low water no more then three fa∣thome depth, keep these foresaid fire-beakons one in the other, or bring the innermost rather a little northwards of the outermost, for to avoid a little plate, which lyeth on the south-side of the Deep, but the Channell is indif∣ferent wide, run untill you come against the strand in two fathome and an halfe, or two fathome, so neare as you will or can and goe then up northwards along by the shore, you shall then (being sailed a little to the north∣wards) meet with a flat, whereupon remaineth at low water lesse then two fathome depth, with laden ships you must ankor before that flat, and stay for high water, it floweth there about eight foot up and downe, so soon as you are over the flat it will be five, six, and seven fathom deep, edge then to the shore, and saile toward it, and then you come before the Brew-house, there is the road where you may ankor in four, five, and six fathome, from thence n. wards towards Yarmouth along the shore is all over good ankoring and good ground.</P>
<P>About an English mile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haven of Yarmouth.</NOTE> or somewhat more to the s. wards of the Towne Yarmouth, is the Haven of Yar∣mouth,

<PB N="13" REF="10"/>stand a little to the northwards of the Castor) one in the other, saile then right with them, either by day or by night (in the night there is fired upon them) you shall so run over a flat, through betwixt two buyes, which lye each of them upon a taile of a sand, saile boldly in with the foresaid fire-beakons, untill that you come againe near the shore, in five or six fathom, being come by the shore, run then again along by it, and keep the sound∣ing thereof as before, all along untill you come before Winterton.</P>
<P>Thwart of Winterton runneth off a dangerous riffe, which is dangerous to saile about by night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe of Wi∣terton, or Winterton Nesse.</NOTE> if men doe come too near it, which is upon the end so steep, that (in three fathom, or two fathom and a halfe) you shall not be a ships length off from it, but when as you (co∣ming from the southwards) keep your selfe in six or se∣ven fathom, then you cannot saile too near to it.

<P>To the northwards of this riffe upon the Land, stand two white fire-beakons, whereupon there is fired by night, for to avoyd this riffe.

Coming from the n. wards along the shore, in five or six fathom, untill you come by the fire-beakons, upon the n. side, you must keep some∣what off from the shore, before they come one in the o∣ther, or else you should run on against the riffe. When they are one in the other they stand s. w. and by west from you, and when as the high fire-beakon to the south∣wards of Winterton, cometh to be s. w. somewhat more westerly from you, then you are thwart of the point of the riffe: you may not also run about far within that riffe, for then you should lightly be foule to the grounds

<P>He that will saile in there with northerly winds, and a floud, must reckon well his tides, for the floud falleth strong to the southwards over the grounds, and should there be lightly carried behind the bank to the s. wards of the buy, which lyeth upon the point of the bank.</P>
<P>Besides this foresaid channel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to saile in to the new channell.</NOTE> there runneth yet ano∣ther channel through the grounds, which lye off from the n. poynt of the Teese. For to saile in there, you must take mark of the two high lands within the land, to the s. wards of the Teese, bring them within a handspikes length one of another, or bring the Paps to the w. side of Hartlenope, then shall also the two foresaid high lands come within a handspikes length near one to the other, saile in right with them, and so you shall run right into that new channel, along through that aforesaid land, and come against the buye (upon the sands, on the s. side of the Deep) again in the right fareway. When that you get againe deeper water, or have the two fire-beakons on the n. side one in the other, then goe in towards them, and further, as hath been before said.</P>
<P>About seven leagues to the n. wards of the Teese, lyeth the River of Sonderland, a little to the n. wards of the Paps, which are very good marks for to know the land by thereabouts. When the Paps are s. s. w. from you, and that you are about an English mile from the land, then you are right before the River of Sonderland, the ground is there about indifferent clean, but somewhat stony, you
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>may ankor there in four, five, and six fathome. On both sides, as well on the n. point, as the s. point of the River, it is stony. On the n. point standeth a Beakon in the wa∣ter, there you must run in, within a little ships length a∣long by it, being past that, you shall get deeper water, to wit, a fathom and a halfe, and two fathome at low water, but upon the barre remaineth no more then three foot: with a common spring and high water there is about two fathome and a halfe, or a little more.</P>
<P>After this aforesaid first depth of a fathome and a half,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sonderland.</NOTE>or two fathom, you shall meet again with a stony floore, about three ships length broad, upon it is at high water about eleven or twelve foot deep, according as the Tides shall run, being over it there, it is againe deeper. A little past that is a narrow place, where a long ship shall scarce be able to wend within it, it is wide enough, and every where good ground.</P>
<P>From the Teese to Tinmouth the Course n. n. w. eight or nine leagues. Tow leagues to the fourth wards of Tin∣mouth lyeth the point of Sonderland, but close to the s. wards of Tinmouth goeth in the river of Newcastle. From the point of Tinmouth shooteth off a ledge of rocks, you must saile in by it, leaving it on the starboard side. The marks for to saile into the River, are two fire-towers, or fire-beakons, which stand upon the n. shore, bring them one in the other, or the innermost (that is the highest) a little to the n. wards of the outermost or lowest, and saile so right in along by the aforesaid ledge of rocks on the n. side, and so you shall have upon the showldest two fathome at halfe flood: a s. w. Moon maketh there full sea. The s. shoare is flat, you may lead it in there with the sounding pole for ships that goe not deep, in ten foot at halfe flood. When you come within, run all along by the n. shoare, until past the little Town Sheels, edge then over to the other shoare, untill you come through the crooked reach, there the river lyeth up againe to the n. wards, and then to the s. wards, to Hawke-bil, and about by it to the Towne Newcastle.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>
<P> Seven or eight leagues to the n. wards of Tinmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bly.</NOTE>lyeth the Cock Island, betwixt them both about halfe wayes lyeth a River called Bly, where the French men do much saile to fetch Coale. From the n. point of this Ri∣ver runneth off a ledge of rocks a great shot of a cast piece about s. e. into the sea, but the s. side, and the Coast to the s. wards of it is very clean and sand-strand. Upon the s. point stand two Beakons, if you will sail in there, bring them one in the other, and sail right in with them, and then you can take no hurt of the foresaid ledge or riffe of the n. poynt. When that you come by or thwart of the outermost of the two foresaid Beakons, you shall see there by it another smaller Beakon, that standeth upon a little ledge of rocks, that shooteth off from the s. point, leave that on the larboard side, and run in along close about n. wards of it. The foresaid ledge of rocks on the n. side re∣maineth at high water (a good wayes from the land, and also at a spring tide) above water, within it is a bight, there it is good lying for a n. or n. e. wind, and there re∣maineth at low water two fathome depth. In the mouth of the River it is with an ordinary tide, and high-water, about two fathome deep, or somewhat more, and it floweth there two fathome up and downe, so that at low water it falleth almost altogether dry.</P>
<P>The Cocker Island is a very little Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocker Island</NOTE> and not high, it lyeth about a halfe league from the land, you may come to an ankor in it for an e. s. and s. e. wind, but the wind coming to the n. wards of the e. maketh there a bad road, for you must lye betwixt the Island and the maine land, where you have no shelter for a n. wind. On the s. side of the Island the ground is foul, and a little to the s. wards of the Island runneth off a foul ledge of rocks from the shore untill thwart or past the Island. He that cometh from the s. wards must keep the Coast of Bambrough without the Island, or else he should not faile to saile upon the point of that foresaid ledge.</P>
<P>Betwixt the ledge and the Island it is also very narrow, so that a man standing at low water mark upon the rocks
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>of this ledge, should almost be able to cast with a stone to the Island. For to sail in there, take heed unto these marks hereafter described: There standeth a house upon the sea∣side, which is a Salt-kettle, and also a Castle somewhat further in within the land, which doth shew it selfe high enough, bring them one in the other, and then they shall stand somewhat more n. then w. from you, and run in so right with them, and so you shall run in amidst the chan∣nell, between both, being come within, edge up behind the Island, and ankor there in five or six fathom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Staples.</NOTE></P>
<P>About this Island there run also many more divers lit∣tle Rivers into the land, but they fall most dry at low water.</P>
<P>From the the Cocket Island to the Staples, the Course is n. n. w. eight or nine leagues. The Staples, that are high Islands &amp; rocks right to the e. wards of Bambrough, lying at least three leagues from the land n. e. into sea, a little to the n. wards of them, lyeth the Holy Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy Island.</NOTE> to the s. wards or the w. wards of the Holy Island is a Bay, where you may lye landlockt almost for all winds, against the Castle is the best road: you may also run in there from the s. wards, through betwixt the Staples and the maine land.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Staples and the Holy Island, lye two sunk∣en rocks, which at low water come very near,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goldstone Plough.</NOTE> even with∣in the water, the westermost towards the Holy Island, is called the gold stone, the eastermost by the Staples, is cal∣led the Plough. For to avoid them when you will saile through betwixt the Staples and the Holy Island, whether you come from the s. wards or the n. wards, then bring the steeple of Toustenbrough over the Castle of Bambrou, and keep them so standing, &amp; then you shall run through betwixt them both, this channel lyeth so through n. e. and s. w. From the outermost end of the Staples to S. Abbens head, the Course is n. w. seven or eight leagues.</P>
<P>From Holy Island to S. Abbens head it is n. n. w. seven or eight leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Abbens head.</NOTE></P>
<P>To the n. wards of S. Abbens head men do run in

<P>S. Abbens head, and the Island Bas lye e. and w. four leagues asunder. The Island May and S. Abbens head, n. w. and s. e. four great leagues. May and Bas lye one from the other, s. w. and by w. and n. e. and by e. three leagues and a halfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bas.</NOTE> The Bas is a high round Rock, clean round about, which you may saile along by on both sides. Be∣twixt the Rock and the s. shore it is ten and twelve fa∣thom deep, but the common faire way is along to the n. wards of it. Between S. Abbens head and the Bas, it is most part a clean Coast, but without ankor ground. The Island May is greater then the Bas, and also very cleane round about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island May.</NOTE> except on the e. side, there it is foule.</P>
<P>From S.

Inchkieth and the Island May lye s. w. and by w. and n. e. and by e. seven great leagues asunder. Inchkieth is somewhat a long smal Island, a league to the n. wards of it lyeth an out-point on the n. Coast called Kingornesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kingornesse.</NOTE> before it and about it lye some little Rocks under water, but a little to the e. wards of the point is good ankor ground, and road for westerly winds. Between that point and the Island May, or the point of Fifines on the n. shore lye divers little ha∣vens, whereof some of them doe also yield out Coals, but are little or nothing used by the Hollanders. On both sides of the Inchkieth is good ground, and good lying, as well for w. or e. winds.</P>
<P>From Inchkieth to Lieth it is s. e. a league.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lieth.</NOTE> Before Lieth about half an English mile from the shore lyeth a Rock, upon which standeth a Mast (with a crosse or some other thing of wood upon the top of it) for a Beakon. At high water the sea floweth over it, and at low water it falleth dry. With a spring tide at low water men may go
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>on foot to it. From the e. side of that Rock lyeth off a Riffe almost unto Inchkieth. You may also run through to the s. wards of Inchkieth, betwixt that foresaid riffe on the s. shore, but it is not to be done but by them which are there exceeding well acquainted, there it is altogether full of rocks and foule ground. When as you saile in to the n. wards of the Inchkieth you must leave the foresaid Mast on the larboard side, and run about to the n. wards of it, and then towards the s. shore, and ankor about halfe an English mile by w. Lieth, and also halfe an Eng∣lish mile from the shoare, in six, seven, or eight fathome. Lieth is the Haven of Edenburgh, a tyde Haven which fal∣leth dry at low water.</P>
<P>From Lieth to Queens Ferry there lye on both sides many Rocks, some above and some under water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queens Ferry</NOTE> In the Narrow before Queens Ferry lyeth a little Island called Inchgrave, which you must run along to the n. wards of, on the s. side it is with a stone bank (where men may goe over at low water) fast to the maine land: along to the n. wards of it is clean and deep. Within that little Island lye Caryn and other places more where men doe lade Coales.</P>
<P>Under the e. side of the point to the n. wards of Queens Ferry, is good road in two, three, or four fathom, ac∣cording as you lye far from the shore.</P>

<P>From the Broad Sound lyeth a Sound in along to the northwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Broad Sound.</NOTE> through the land, which cometh out againe into the Sound to the northwards, and so maketh an I∣sland of the land whereupon the high hill Hanglip lyeth. When as you will saile in there from the northwards, that is, to the northwards of Hanglip, you must run in nearest by the south shore, and edge to it betimes. In this channell betwixt both lands lye two Islands or Rocks, the greatest lyeth nearest the north shoare, and the smal∣lest nearest the south shoare, betwixt them both lyeth also a suncken Rock, which at low water is uncovered, and at High water you may know it by the breaking upon it. When as you will saile in here, you must leave the fore∣said greatest Rock, with the suncken Rock, on the star∣board side, and the smallest Rock on the larboard side,
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>there is upon the showldest three fathom and a half water.</P>
<P>Within this Haven lye also two Havens at the n. point, which lye into the land, where is good lying.</P>
<P>When as you will sail from this foresaid Haven through within unto the Broad Sound, you shall meet scarce half wayes with a Rock, from which lyeth off a riffe towards the west shoare, thwart of it you must run close along by the west shoare, for to avoid that riffe.</P>
<P>To the northwards of Hanglip, the land of Hitland ly∣eth n. n. and by e. and n. n. e. at last north, and at some places you may saile in through Hitland, especially to the northwards of Hanglip, where a faire broad Sound lyeth northwest through, there is good ankor ground to find at some places, for those that are there acquainted. From Hanglip to the n. e. point of Hitland, the Course is n. n. e. ten leagues, there lye some out-rocks called the Out-scares. From thence along to the n. point of Hit∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Out-scares.</NOTE>the Course is n. about four leagues.</P>
<P>A little about the east point goeth in a fair Haven cal∣led Bloem Sound, lying in south-west.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bloem sound.</NOTE> On the west side lyeth a long Rock, you must sail in to the eastwards of it, and ankor a little within the Haven, it is there within all clean sand ground, and good lying. Bloem sound ly∣eth in first (as hath been said) south-south-west after∣wards, south and south and by east, on both sides is good ankor ground, there you may sail altogether through, and come out againe through Jellesound into sea, about the Island Fero.</P>
<P>The greatest and chiefest Islands of Fero,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of the Islands of Fe∣ro.</NOTE> are 12 in num∣ber: as <HI>Suydro, Satrdo, Moggenes, Wage, Stromo, Ostro, Calso, Cuno, Bordo, Wydro, Sreyno,</HI> and <HI>Fulo.</HI></P>
<P>The little Islands of Fero are ten, as <HI>Little Dymen, Sto∣er Dymen, Schuyvo, Dalifles Hesden, Trallo, Colster, Mogge∣sholme, the Monk, and the Bishop.</HI> Besides these are yet some Rocks, and little Islands, to seven or eight in number.</P>
<P>The southermost great Island, called Suydro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suydro,</NOTE> lieth most south-rast, and north-west, about seven or eight leagues.
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>At the s. e. end of this Island lieth a high Rock, called the Monk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk Somby.</NOTE> or Sombie, after the name of the first or south-ermost Haven in Suydro. Betwixt the Monk and the s. e. end of the Island Suydro, is a Race or Well, which men must avoid, especially with spring tides.</P>
<P>Upon the west side of the Island Suydro, are no Ha∣vens for to save any ships in, but it is altogether high steep land. On the north side are may Havens, where men may saile into and save ships, as Sommersound or Hest, Hof∣wyke, Urobie, Quaelbie or Rane, all broad sounds of Havens, a Countrey-man or Pilot can bring you in there every where to your desire.</P>
<P>From the northwest end Suydro to Moggenesholme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moggenes∣holme.</NOTE>the westermost and outermost Island of Fero, the Course is north-west, and by north, and north-north-west, a∣bout eight or nine leagues.</P>
<P>At the east end of Moggenesholme lieth Moggenes, to the eastwards of it lyeth the Island Wage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moggenes. Wage.</NOTE> and to the east∣wards of Wage goeth in a faire sound from the south∣wards off from the Island Sando, about Hesten, and the I∣sland Colster, for you may run in about these Islands on both sides, and leave the great Island Stromo on the east side, and so come into Wage. In the middest of the Sound of Wage, goeth up a haven to the eastwards into the great Island Stromo, therein you may ankor in ten or twelve fathom, but the Sound is at least twenty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Moggenes and the north-east end of Fero, lye east-north-east, or a little more northerly, and west-south-west, about fiften leagues asunder. Betwixt them both lye ten Islands, and betwixt each Island, is a faire broad and deep sound, whereof the fourth off from Moggenes is cal∣led Somsound. All these Sounds lye most north-north-west and south-south-east through the land, and upon all these Islands stand Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somsound.</NOTE> except upon Ostra, which neverthelesse is a great Island.</P>
<P>From the south-east end of Suydro to Scalhead, or the south-east end of the Island Sando, the Course is north and by west about five leagues. Betwixt Suydro and San∣do
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>lye the little Islands, Little Dymen, Stoer Dymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Dymen Stoer Dymen.</NOTE>Schavo, and Dalsfles.</P>
<P>From Scalhead untill within the Island Mulso (lying before Stromo) the Course is n. and by w. four leagues, there you may every where ankor, where you will, in twenty, thirty, or forty fathom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stromo.</NOTE> If any man coming in out of the sea, desireth to see a good road or haven, under the Islands of Fero, he shall keep that middlemost great I∣sland Stromo n. w. and n. w. and by w. from him, and then he shall see upon the middest of the Island Stromo, a high steep hill called Schelling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schelling.</NOTE> which he must saile right in with, and so he shall meet with that foresaid Island Mulso, a low Island, which you may saile about on both sides, but it is best for to run in there at the s. south end, under the Island is all over good ankor ground. Right over against this Island, on the great Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Torshaven.</NOTE> lyeth Tors∣haven, the chiefest Haven of Fero, where all the trade of Merchandize is.</P>
<P>From Torshaven or the Island Mulso, to the north-east end of Fero, the Course is north-east, and north-east and by east, about twelve or thirteen leagues, betwixt them both lye seven Islands, and betwixt each Island, as hath been said, goeth a broad sound through the land, lying through about north-west, north-west and by north, and north-north-west. The north end of Fero is about four leagues broad, and lyeth north-west, and south-east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fulo.</NOTE>and is called Fulo, thwart of it lyeth the Bishop.</P>
<P>He that desireth to sail off from Mulso into Somsound, let him go on north-west and by north, three leagues, un∣to the point of Bordenes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bishop.</NOTE> up north-west off from Bordenes, and then he shall espie a Church upon the I∣sland Calso, which he must leave on starboard side, and go in along west-north-west untill he come into the bight of the Island Ostro, and ankor there in seventeen or eighteen fathom.</P>
<P>These Island of Fero lye in a triangle, it is from the s. e. end of Suydro to Fulo, or the n. end of Fero n. n. e. and s. s. w. twenty one leagues asunder.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>
<P> From Scotland westwards, and to the northwards of Ireland, lye many Islands, whereof we shall here describe some with so much perfectnesse as thereof is yet known.</P>
<P>The names of the principall Islands lying there, are these:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of the Islands.</NOTE> <HI>Areu, Ila, Jona, Mulla, Bragedall, Hun, Lewis, St. Patricius, St. Maria, St. Golane, St. Petous, Epth,</HI> and <HI>St. Kilda,</HI> these are the greatest; there are yet some small I∣slands, as <HI>Rona, Chent, Trauta, Fladde, Grand Melul, Petit Melul, Stalpan, Cannay, Rum, Egghe, Mule, Cutte, Cranden∣brough, Gronsay, St. Karbo, Lismont, Swynoy, Machare, Gegay, Caray,</HI> and <HI>Navarsay.</HI> All these Islands doe lye and belong under Scotland, and are those which by the Cosmogra∣phers are called <HI>Insulae Hebrides.</HI></P>
<P>The Island Barre or Rona is the northermost Island ly∣ing behind Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barre, or Ro∣na.</NOTE> and lyeth from Fulo about w. s. w. thirty seven, or thirty eight leagues, it lyeth by two other little Islands about a great league one from the other.</P>
<P>The Islands of Lewis lye from Rona south-west distant sixteen or seventeen leagues, and from the north end of Lewis to S. Kilda, it is s. w. and w. sixteen leagues.</P>
<P>On the east side of S. Kilda is a good road for a w. and n. w. wind. This Island lyeth by the other little Islands, whereof the two are not very great, upon that which ly∣eth to the westwards you may see some houses stand, and these two little Islands lye ten leagues to the westwards of the great Island of Lewis. Upon the coast of Lewis lye also two rowes of great Rocks, like as if they were little Islands lying one from the other south and north, some∣what easterly, about seven or eight leagues.</P>
<P>The southermost lye by three little Islands, but the northermost lye by eight small little Islands or Rocks.</P>
<P>The Island of Lewis is divided into many parts, the which men may sail through at many and divers places. Lewis with the Island belonging to it, lye s. s. w. and s. and by w. about twenty nine leagues.</P>
<P>But on the east side goeth a broad sound through of five or six leagues. Men sail in close by the Island of Lew∣is, about s. s. w. until past the Island Cheut.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>
<P> From thence the Sound lyeth through betwixt the great Island Bragadul and Lewis, s. and s. and by w. to∣wards the west end of Lewis, called the Ephts, then you must leave Mulla and Ila, with many other Islands on the larboard side.</P>
<P>Jona, Ila, Mulla, and Bragadul, are four of the great∣est Islands which are lying on the west coast of Scotland, and lye close by the main land, but there are many Ha∣vens and Sounds, so that there you may saile in and about them every where.</P>
<P>At the n. w. point of Ireland lye also some Havens, which you may saile through and round about them all.</P>
<P>Betwixt Rona and Orkney lye also some Islands, w<SUP>ch</SUP> also you may saile through betwixt, and round about.</P>
<P>He that falleth with these Islands, must be very carefull and circumspect, for the most part of them are inhabited by wild and savage people.</P>
<P>In Lewis and the Islands thereabouts, a s. w. and n. e. Moon maketh the highest water: and likewise also with∣out the n. poynt of Scotland.</P>
