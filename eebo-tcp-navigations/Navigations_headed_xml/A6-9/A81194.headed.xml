<HEAD><HI>OF</HI> GOVERNMENTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Original of Governments.</HEAD>
<P>OF GOVERNMENTS there can be but Three kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> One, or More, or All, must have the Sovereign Power of a Nation: If one, then it is a <HI>Monar∣chy;</HI> If more, (as an Assembly of Choice Persons) then it is <HI>Aristocracy;</HI> if All (that is, a General Assembly of the People,) then it is a <HI>Democracy:</HI> And now in course we are first to speak of,</P>
<P>The <HI>Monarchical Government,</HI> which as most resembling the Divinity, and approaching nearest to Perfection, be∣ing esteemed the most Excellent, is of two sorts, <HI>Regal</HI> and <HI>Political:</HI> The first sort,</P>
<P><HI>Monarchy Regal</HI> was begun by <HI>Nim∣rod,</HI> who (after the World began to increase) got unto himself a Dominion
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>over others; and yet in Scripture he is not called a King, but a <HI>Mighty Hunter before the Lord:</HI> So <HI>Belus</HI> did subdue the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> and <HI>Ninus</HI> the most part of <HI>Asia;</HI> and so did the <HI>Romans</HI> usurp the Empire of the World.</P>
<P>And thus having set forth the begin∣ning of the <HI>Regal Government</HI> of King∣doms; which Law <HI>Regal</HI> was no other thing but the Pleasure of the Prince, as in the First of <HI>Kings</HI> you may read more at large: We will now, as being more for our purpose, declare how King∣doms of <HI>Political Government</HI> were first begun, which we may term,</P>
<P><HI>Monarchy Political.</HI> St. <HI>Augustine</HI> in the 19th Book <HI>De Civitate Dei,</HI> saith, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People is a Multitude of Men associated by the Consent of Law, and Communion of Wealth:</HI> And yet such a People without a Head, is not worthy to be called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Body; as in Natural things, the Head cut off is not called a Body, but a Trunk Wherefore <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Civil Philoso∣phy saith, <HI>Whensoever One is made of Many, among the same, One shall be the Ruler, and the other shall be the Rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> And this Ruler thus raised and ap∣pointed in Kingdoms is called a <HI>King</HI> from the Saxon word Koning, intima∣ting Power and Knowledge, wherewith every Sovereign ought especially to be
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>Invested: And thus of a Multitude of People ariseth a Kingdom, which is a Body Mystical. And in this Body <HI>Mysti∣cal,</HI> or <HI>Political,</HI> the Intent of the People (like Blood in the Natural Body) is the first lively thing; that is Politick pro∣vision for the Utility and Wealth of the same People, which is imparted to the Head and members of the same Body, whereby it is Nourished and Maintained; and by the Law, which cometh from <HI>Ligando,</HI> of Binding, this Mystical Body is knit and preserv'd to∣gether, and the Members and Parts thereof, as the Natural Body by Sinews, do every one retain their proper Fun∣ctions: And as the Head of a Natural Body cannot change his Sinews, nor withhold from his Inferiour Members their peculiar Powers of Nourishments; no more can a King, which is the Head of the Body Politick, change the Laws of that Body, or withdraw from the said People their proper Substance a∣gainst their Wills.</P>
<P>And therefore it now follows, that we speak somewhat of the Fundamen∣tals of laws in General, and then de∣scend to the particular Fundamentals of the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> and afterwards briefly declare the Executive Powers of the same. And first of</P>

<HEAD>Laws in General.</HEAD>
<P>WHich are Four, that more proper∣ly belong to this our Business; <HI>(viz.) The Law Enternal, The Law of Nations, Divine Law,</HI> and <HI>Human Law.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Law Eternal.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Aeterna</HI> is the Reason of the Divine Will, whereby God will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave all things of him Created, to be moved and directed to a good End; and it is called <HI>The first Law,</HI> and all other Laws are derived from it. And this Law Eternal none may be able to know, as in himself, but the Blessed alone: But God of his Goodness re∣vealeth it to all, in as much as is ne∣cessary for them, otherwise he should bind his Creatures to impossible things, which to be in God is most wicked to think. And God reveals this Law Eternal, or the Divine Will, to the Ra∣tional Creature Three manner of ways, that is, First by the Light of Natural Understanding, and then it is called <HI>The Law of Reason:</HI> Secondly, by Di∣vine Revelation, and then it is called <HI>The Divine Law:</HI> Thirdly, by Reason in the Prince, or any other Secondary Pe son Governing, who hath power to Impose a Law upon this Subjects, and
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>then it is called <HI>Humane Law,</HI> altho' it be Originally instituted from God: And because whatsoever the Second Cause doth, the First doth also by a more Noble manner; therefore the a∣foresaid Three Laws are called in God, <HI>One Law Eternal;</HI> and this is that Law of which it is written, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Reges regnant, Et legum conditores justa discernunt.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Law of Reason.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Rationis,</HI> which amongst Doctors is also called <HI>The Law of Nature,</HI> or <HI>Jus Gentium, The Law of Nations,</HI> may be doubly considered, that is, either as it respects all Creatures, even Irratio∣nals, for all Irrational Creatures, not hindred, do live and subsist under cer∣tain Rules to them set by Nature, they also conserve their kind and by Instinct of Nature nourish their Young; and things by Nature contrary to them they fear, and especially when alone it re∣spects the Rational Humane Creature, created to the Image of God: And it is called <HI>The Law of Nations,</HI> for that it ought to be kept by all Nations, as well among the Jews and Gentiles, as Chri∣stians. And thus, <HI>The Law of Reason</HI> is a participation of <HI>The Law Enternal:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>From whence it is said in the <HI>Psalms, Signatum est super nos Lumen vultus tui Domine, scilicet, Lumen Veritatis.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Divine Law.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Divina,</HI> is a true Sign reveal'd to the Rational Creature of the Divine Reason, Willing the Rational Creature, to be held or bound to do something, or not do it, for obtaining Eternal Felicity, as are the Laws of the Old Testament, which are called <HI>Morals,</HI> and the <HI>Evangelical Law;</HI> and some∣times it is called, <HI>Law instituted by Man,</HI> but improperly nevertheless, when the Law is for obtaining Eternal Felicity.</P>
<P>Moreover, besides <HI>The Law of Reason</HI> and <HI>Humane Law,</HI> it was necessary for the Direction of Humane Life, to have the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> for Four Reasons: First, Whereas Man was created to enjoy Eternal Beatitude, it was necessary that besides the <HI>Law of Reason</HI> and <HI>Humane Law,</HI> he should be Directed to his End by a Law Divinely instituted. Secondly, For the incertainty of Humane Judg∣ment, that he should be directed by a Law given by Divine Inspiration, from which it appeared, that he might by no means deviate. Thirdly, Because the Judgment of Man may not be of
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>Interior Acts; therefore it was neces∣sary to have a Law Divine, which should rectifie the Interiors, as well as the Exteriors of Men, Fourthly, Be∣cause Human Law cannot punish every evil Act, it was necessary to have a Divine Law, which should let no Evil go unpunished; and these four Reasons are touched in this Verse,</P>
<P><HI>Lex Domini immaculata convertens animas, Testimonium Domini Fidelis sapientiam praestants Parvulis.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Humane Law.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEx Humana sive Positiva,</HI> is a Law Deduced by Reason, from the Law of Reason, and the Divine Law; and therefore in every Positive Law well Instituted, there is somewhat of the Law of Reason, and the Divine Law, And Humane Law is a true sign by Hu∣mane Tradition and Authority, imme∣diately Constituted: And that Human Law be Just, Two things are required; That is, Prudence and Authority, be∣cause it is called <HI>Lex à ligando,</HI> but every Sentence of a Prudent Man doth not bind the Community or any of them, if he do not preside over them. And in the Law of Men these Proprieties are required, <HI>viz.</HI> That they be Honest, Just,
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>Possible, according to the Custom of the Country, and convenient to the place and time; Necessary, Profitable, Manifest; also that they be Ordained for no Private end, but for the Com∣mon good; and Humane Laws not con∣trary to the Divine Law ought to be kept also in Conscience, <HI>Et qui eas sper∣nit Deo resistit.</HI></P>
<P>From what hath been said it appears, That the Divine Law respects the Spi∣ritual end, The Law of Reason the Natural end, and that Human Law may direct to both; And the Law of Reason takes of Nature of the thing for a Foundation, but Human Law, the pub∣lick Expedience or Good.</P>
<P>Now of these Four Laws, all Laws in general consist and be sounded, if they are good. And that we may shew par∣ticularly, and more especially from whence arise,</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Fundamentals of the Law of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE must know that the Law of <HI>England,</HI> or Humane Law in <HI>England,</HI> takes its Fundamentals from Six chief Principles: First, <HI>The Law of Reason.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Divine Law.</HI> Third∣ly, <HI>Divers Customs of the Kingdom.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Divers Principles</HI> called
<PB N="9" REF="12"/><HI>Maxims.</HI> Fifthly, <HI>Particular Customs in certain places.</HI> Sixthly, <HI>From divers Sta∣tutes of the Common Council of the King∣dom in Parliament;</HI> of which we shall speak something in order.</P>
<P>And first, <HI>The Law of Reason</HI> is held in this as in all other Kingdoms; and the Learned in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> make two Degrees of the Law of Rea∣son, <HI>(scilicet) Lex. Rationis Primariae, &amp; Lex Rationis secundariae: Ex Primaria,</HI> From the first are forbidden Murder, Manslaughter, Oppression of the Inno∣cent, Perjuries, Deceits and many such like. But the manner of punishing these sorts of Offences, is according to di∣vers Principles and Maxims or Statutes, to this end especially ordained; and it is called the Law of Reason primary; For that those things which are Com∣manded or Forbidden by that Law, are grounded upon Reason also, with∣out any other Law joyned or opposed to it: The Law of Reason secundary is likewise divided in two parts, That is, General and Particular; The Law of Reason secundary General, is de∣rived from that Law of Propriety Ge∣neral, which is held throughout the World; From this are prohibited Thefts, Disseisins, and many other, And it is called the Law of Reason
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>Secundary, for that it is founded not upon Reason alone, but from the Law of Propriety, and the Reason derived from that Law; for because the Law of property saith, <HI>Such a thing is the pro∣per Goods of such a Man;</HI> Therefore saith Reason, grounded upon that Law, <HI>that thing is not to be taken from him un∣justly against his Will.</HI> And the Law of Reason Secundary Particular, is that which is Founded upon divers Gene∣ral and Particular Customs, and divers Maxims and Statutes, only had and or∣dained in the Kingdom of <HI>England:</HI> As if a Distress dye, it shall not be imputed to him who distrained; but to him who hath the Propriety, because the Defect is to be assigned in him, for that he did not pay the Rent: And Reason is founded upon the Cu∣stom aforesaid, so that there need not be any Written Law had thereof. And we find so many Secundary Reasons in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that many are willing to affirms the whole Law of <HI>England,</HI> to be proved by Reason, which notwithstanding is by no means to be affirmed, as by another Example.</P>
<P>By a certain Statute it is Ordained, That he who hath abjur'd the Realm, whilst he is in the publick High-way, shall be in peace with our Lord the
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>King and not in any sort molested; and by the Custom of the Kingdom, he is to be conducted from Town to Town, by the Constables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Sea-port, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now if he Escape, the Constable ought not to be charged to the King, because by reason of the Statute, he could not keep him in safe Custody, or use any Force or Impri∣sonment whereby he might be kept in safe Custody; and the Reason is ground∣ed upon that Statute. And some say, Rob∣bery is to be prohibited from Reason Primary, even before the Law of Pro∣perty, for that it was not Lawful even when all things were in Common, to take any thing from another by force, or to throw him out of his Habitati∣on; but that such Robbery is to be punished with Death, is from the Cu∣stom of the Law of <HI>England.</HI> Also from the General Law of Property aforesaid, by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are excepted Birds, Wild beasts and Beasts of Warren, in which by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> is no Property to any One, unless they be Tame; yet ne∣vertheless by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in the Eggs of <HI>Herons,</HI> and such like, Build∣ing in the Woods of any, is a Proper∣ty. And for that every Deduction of Reason in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> pro∣ceeds
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>from the first Principles, or from somewhat from those Principles deri∣ved, no Man althô the most Wise, can Judge justly or Argue rightly in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> if he know not these Principles.</P>
<P>The Second Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England</HI> is <HI>Lex Divina,</HI> whereby to punish the Transgressors against the <HI>Divine Law.</HI> The Law of <HI>England</HI> in many Courts of our Lord the King doth Inquire of Hereticks: Also if any Statute be made or set forth against them; as that none shall give Alms, it ought to be of no force; also, Per∣sons Excommunicated in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> may not Prosecute, nor have Communication with others whilst the Excommunication is certified. And from the same Fundamental the Law of <HI>England</HI> admits the Spiritual Juris∣diction of Tithes, and other things which do of right belong to the Ec∣clesiastical Jurisdiction, and receives Ca∣nonical or Ecclesiastical Laws, <HI>Quae non Excedunt potestatem ferentis:</HI> so that in many Cases it behoves the Kings Ju∣stices to Judge according to the Laws of the Church; As if the Law of the Church be, that the Sentence of Di∣vorce is not in force till it is affirmed upon Appeal, The Judges of our Lord
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>the King, shall form their Judgment according to the Laws of the Church; And if <HI>A. B.</HI> and <HI>C. D.</HI> have Goods and Chattels joyntly, and <HI>A. B.</HI> by his last Will, give his part to <HI>E. F.</HI> the Ecclesi∣astical Judges are bound in this case to adjudge this Will void.</P>
<P>The Third Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> is the General Customs of the Kingdom, which are divers Ge∣neral Customs used and approved of in Ancient time, throughout the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and who at∣tempts any thing against them Works against Law and Justice; And these are properly called the Common Law, and ought always to be determined by the Judges, whether a General Custom or not, and not by the Country; and of these and other Principles or <HI>Maxims,</HI> a great part of the Law of <HI>England</HI> de∣pends; and therefore the King by his Coronation Oath promiseth <HI>(inter alia)</HI> that he will faithfully observe all the Customs of the Kingdom; and the An∣cient Customs of the Kingdom, is the Original and Foundation of divers Courts in the same Kingdom; Where∣of one is <HI>The Chancery</HI> of the King∣dom, in which <HI>(inter alia)</HI> Writs origi∣nal are obtained, directed to other Courts of the King; another <HI>The Kings-Bench,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>in which are handled all Trea∣sons, Murders, Homicides, Felonies, and other things done against the Kings Peace; another Court is called <HI>The Common Bench,</HI> in which Common Pleas are handled; (That is to say,) of Lands and Tenements, Debts and Chattels and such like; another Court is called <HI>The Kings Exchequer,</HI> in which are handled divers matters touching the King alone, as of Sheriffs, Escheats or Receivers, Bayliffs and other the Kings Officers and the like; and these are called Courts of Record, because those who preside as Judges ought to be assigned by the Kings Letters Patent; and these Courts have many and di∣vers other Authorities, of which we shall speak more hereafter in their proper places, and likewise of divers other Courts of inferiour Authority in the Kingdom of <HI>England:</HI> And althô in divers Statutes and Books, mention is made of the Authority of these Courts; yet we have no written Law of their Institution; for their Institu∣tion depends upon the Custom of the Kingdom, which hath so great Autho∣rity, that they may not be altered, or their Names changed or altered, but by Act of Parliament. Also there is an Ancient Custom, which is confir∣med
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>by the Statute of <HI>Marlebridge;</HI> That all shall do and receive Justice in the Kings Court, and another, that none shall be put to Answer, or be judged, but according to the Law of the Land; and this is confirmed by <HI>Magna Charta:</HI> And there are other General Customs in the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> which retain the force of Law, as that the eldest Son shall succeed the Father in the Inheritance, and many more, not here to be recited.</P>
<P>From whence it appears, that Cu∣stoms in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> may not be proved by Reason alone, for how can it be proved by Reason, that the Husband shall have the Wife's Land for Term of his Life, as Tenant by that Law, and that the Wife shall have only the Third part, <HI>scilicet,</HI> that it shall be so done and not otherwise? And it is certain, that the Law of Property is not the Law of Reason, but a Custo∣mary Law, and ought to be accoun∣ted amongst the General Customs of the Kingdom, and there is not any Statute or written Law of the Institu∣tions of the Customs of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> but according to the Skilful in the Law of <HI>England:</HI> The Ancient Customs of the Law of <HI>England</HI> are of themselves of sufficient Authority;
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>and the Customary Law is the most firm Law, provided such a Custom be not against the Law of God, or the Law of Reason.</P>
<P>The Fourth Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England</HI> consists of <HI>Divers Principles,</HI> which the Learned in the Law call <HI>Maxims,</HI> always esteemed and held for Law of this Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> which none Learned in the Law may contradict, because every one of them gives Faith or Credit to it self; and whether a Maxim or not is to be tried by the Judges, as before is said of General Customs of the Kingdom, and not by the Country: And these <HI>Maxims</HI> are not alone taken for Law, but also all other like cases, and all things necessarily following upon them, are to be placed in like Law, and they are in the same force and strength in Law as Statutes; and althô all these <HI>Maxims</HI> might conveni∣ently be numbred amongst the afore∣said General Customs, since Ancient Custom is the sole Authority, as well of these as those; yet because those Ge∣neral Customs are diffused and known, they may easily and without study in the Laws be known, but these Max∣ims are only known in the Kings Courts, or by those who are Learned
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>in the Law; and now for example sake we will mention a few of them, since to declare them fully great Vo∣lumes would not suffice: And first, there is a certain Maxim in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that no Prescription in Lands maketh a Right; also, that Prescripti∣on in Rents and Profits to be taken in the Lands of another maketh a Right; also, that the limitation of Pre∣scription is generally taken <HI>à tempore cujus centrarij Memoria hominum non ex∣istit, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And further, there are many other Maxims, as in certain Actions, The Process is by Summons, Attachment and Distress Infinite; and in some by <HI>Capias</HI> Infinite, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that there should be these divers Processes in di∣vers Actions, may seem expedient and reasonable; but that there should be these divers Processes had in the Law of <HI>England,</HI> and none other, cannot be proved by Reason; therefore they must necessarily have their force from the Maxims aforesaid, or the Ancient Cu∣stom of the Kingdom: And some Maxims seem to be founded upon Reason Secundary; and therefore some may think they may be put unto the first Fundamental of other Laws of <HI>England;</HI> as if any command a Tres∣pass, he is a Trespassor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<P>And there are other <HI>Maxims</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> which are not so manifestly known, but may be known by the Law of <HI>Reason;</HI> partly by Books of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> which are called <HI>Year Terms,</HI> partly by <HI>Records</HI> in the Kings Treasury, and remaining in the Kings Courts; and by a Book cal∣led the <HI>Register,</HI> and by divers <HI>Statutes,</HI> in which such Customs and Maxims are often recited. <HI>Vide Doctor &amp; Stu∣dent.</HI></P>
<P>The Fifth Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England</HI> consists of <HI>Divers particular Customs,</HI> used in divers Countries, Towns, Lordships, or Mannors and Cities of the Kingdom; which said particular Customs, because they are not against Reason, nor the Law of God, altho' they are contrary to the afore∣said General Customs, and Maxims of Law, yet they retain the force of Laws: And they ought not always to be de∣termined by the Judges, whether there be such a Custom or not, unless in a few particular Customs sufficiently known and approved in the Kings Courts, but ought to be tryed by the Country: And of these particular Cu∣stoms I shall put a few for Example; As there is a Custom called <HI>Gavelkind</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> where all the Brothers shall
<PB N="19" REF="17" MS="y"/>Inherit as the Sisters do at Common Law: By <HI>Burrough English,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the younger Son shall Inherit: In some Countries the Wife shall have all the Inheritance of her Husband, in Name of <HI>Dower,</HI> so long as she continues a Widow: And in some Countries the Man shall have half the Inheritance of the Wife du∣ring his Life, although he hath no Issue by her: In some Countries the Infant may make a Feoffment at his Age of Fifteen years: And in some Countries, when he can Measure an Ell of Cloth; yet such Infant may not make Warranty, for if he do, it is void in Law, neither may he in such case make a Release. Thus are held many other particular Customs.</P>
<P>The Sixth Fundamental consists of <HI>Divers Statutes Ordained in Parliament,</HI> when other Fundamentals of the Law of <HI>England</HI> are not sufficient; for it is to be known, that altho' the Law of Reason may be assigned to be the first and principal Fundamental of the Law of <HI>England:</HI> yet the Law of <HI>Reason</HI> is not of so great force and efficacy in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that it alone being known, all the Law of <HI>England</HI> is known: For besides the Law of <HI>Reason,</HI> he who desires to know the Laws of
<PB N="20" REF="18"/><HI>England,</HI> ought to know the Custom of the Kingdom, as well General a Particular, and the Maxims and Sta∣tutes of Law, or otherwise, altho' h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were the wisest of Men, he will under∣stand but few things of the Truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>From these things before contain'd it may be deduced, which often fall out, That in one and the same case two or three Fundamentals of Law ought to concur together before the Plaintiff may obtain his Right, as by Example may appear: As if any afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Entry by him made into any Land with a strong hand, make a Feoffmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Maintenance, to defraud the Pos∣sessor of his Action; then the Deman∣dant by the Statute of 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 9. shall recover his treble Damages, ac∣cording to what Damages shall be assessed by the Jury: In which case it appeareth that such Entry is prohibited by the Law of Reason Secundary; but that the Demandant shall Recover, his treble Damages, is by the aforesaid Statute: And that the Damages shall be Assessed by the Jury, is by the Custom of the Kingdom: And thus Three Fundamentals of Law concur in this case.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
<P>And it is to be noted, that there are many Customs, as well General as Par∣ticular, and also Divers Laws, called <HI>Maxims,</HI> which take not their force from strong Reason, but from the Cu∣stom of the Kingdom: For by <HI>Statutes</HI> they may be changed into the contra∣ry, and what can be changed, can ne∣ver be affirmed to be the Law of Reason Primary: As for Example; How doth it stand with Reason or Conscience, That if one Bound in an Obligation to pay Money, pay part of the Money, but takes no Acquittance, or lose it; by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> he shall be com∣pell'd to pay that Money again, because of the General Maxim, That in an Acti∣on of Debt upon Bond, the Defendant may not plead <HI>Nihil debet,</HI> or <HI>Quod poe∣cuniam solvit,</HI> nor otherwise discharge himself unless by Acquittance, or other sufficient Writing amounting to a Dis∣charge in Law; and this to avoid the great Inconvenience which would fol∣low, if every one by word alone might avoid an Obligation.</P>
<P>And thus having briefly set forth the Fundamentals of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> we shall proceed to the Government, and the Legislative and Executive Pow∣er of the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>The King, who being <HI>Caput, Princi∣pium &amp; Finis Parliamenti,</HI> Sits there as in his Royal Politick Capacity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lords Spiritual;</HI> As the Two Archbishops, and Bishops being in number about Twenty four, who sit there by Succession, in respect of their Baronies; and to every one of these, <HI>Ex Debito Justitiae</HI> a Writ of Summons is to be directed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lords Temporal;</HI> As Dukes, Mar∣quesses, Earls, Viscounts and Barons, who sit there by reason of their Dignities; and were in the Lord <HI>Cokes</HI> time about 106, now near twice that number.</P>
<P>And every of these being of full Age, <HI>Ex Debito Justitiae</HI> ought to have a Writ of Summons. And</P>

<P>The manner of Summoning a Parli∣ament is in manner following: About 40 days before their time of Sitting, the King <HI>cum Advisamento Consilij sui,</HI> Issues out of <HI>Chancery</HI> Writs of Sum∣mons to every Lord of Parliament Spiritual and Temporal, Commanding the Lords Spiritual in <HI>Fide &amp; Dilecti∣one;</HI> and the Lords Temporal <HI>per Fi∣dem &amp; Allegiantiam</HI> to Appear, Treat, and give their Advice in certain Im∣portant Affairs concerning the Church and State, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Warrant is <HI>per ipsum Regem &amp; Concilium.</HI></P>
<P>And for Summoning the Commons, a Writ goeth to the Lord <HI>Warden</HI> of the <HI>Cinque Ports,</HI> for Election of the Barons of the <HI>Cinque Ports,</HI> who in Law are Burgesses; and to every Sheriff in the 52 Counties in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> for the Choice and Election of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, with∣in every of their Counties respective∣ly; Two Knights for each County; Two Citizens for each City; and One or Two Burgesses for each Bur∣rough, according to Statute, Charter or Custom.</P>
<P>Persons Elected for each County ought to be <HI>Milites Notabiles,</HI> or at leastwise Esquires or Gentlemen fit to be made Knights; they ought to be Na∣tive

And for Legality of Sit∣ting in Parliament, he must be 21 years old.</P>
<P>All the Members of Parliament both Lords and Commons, with their Me∣nial Servants and necessary Goods, are Priviledg'd during the time of Parlia∣ment <HI>Eundo, Morando, &amp; ad proprium redeundo;</HI> But not from Arrests for Felony, Treason or Breach of the Peace.</P>

And when a Bishop is Lord Chancel∣lor, he usually takes a Text of Scrip∣ture
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>in Latin and Discouses thereupon▪ And when a Judge, by way of Ora∣tion, he Declares the Cause of Calling the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Lords in their House have power of Judicature. The Commons in their House to some purposes have power of Judicature, and both together have power of Judicature. But this will require a whole Treatise. 4 <HI>Co. Inst</HI> 23.</P>
<P>The Lords give their Voices from the <HI>Puisne</HI> Lord <HI>Seriatim,</HI> Content, or not Content.</P>
<P>The Commons give their Votes by Yeas, and Noes; and if it be doubt∣ful Two are appointed, one for the Yeas, another for the Noes, to number them; the Yeas going out, and the Noes sitting still as being content with their Condition; but at a Committee although of the whole House, the Yeas go on one side, and the Noes on the other, whereby the greatest num∣ber will easily appear.</P>
<P>The Royal Assent to Bills passed both Houses, is given in this manner: The King Sitting in his Throne of State, with his Crown on his Head, in his Royal Robes, and the Lords in their Robes; The Clerk of the Crown Reads the Title of the Bills, to which the Clerk of the Parliament according

<P>If it be a Bill for Money given his Majesty; then the Answer is, <HI>Le Roy remercie ses loyaux sujets accepte leur Be∣nevolence, &amp; aussi le veut.</HI></P>
<P>The Bill for the King's General Pardon, hath but one Reading in ei∣ther House, for this Reason, because they must take it as the King will please to give it: so the Bill of Subsi∣dies granted by the Clergy, assembled in Convocation for the same Reason. When the Bill for the General Pardon is passed by the King; the Answer is thus, <HI>Les Prelates Seigneurs &amp; Commu∣nes en ce Parliament Assembles, au nom de tous vos autres Sujets, remercient tres humblement votre Majeste &amp; prient Dieu vous donner en sante bonne Vie, &amp; lon∣gue.</HI></P>
<P>All Acts of Parliament before the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. were passed, and en∣rolled in Latin or French, now in English.</P>
<P>Most of our ancient Acts of Parlia∣ment run in this Stile: <HI>The King at the Humble Request of the Commons, with the Assent of the Prelates, Dukes, Earls
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>and Barons hath Ordained or Enacted;</HI> After it was thus, <HI>The King by the Ad∣vice and Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and with the Assent of the Com∣mons doth Enact:</HI> Of latter times it hath been thus, <HI>Be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, by, and with the Ad∣vice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons;</HI> Al∣though the words of the Writ, for Summoning the Commons is only <HI>ad Consentiendum,</HI> and not <HI>ad consilium im∣pendendum;</HI> as it is in the Writ to the Lords.</P>
<P>The Adjourments are made in the Lords House, by the Lord Chancellor, to what other Day, or Place the King thinks fit.</P>
<P>The Prorogations are made in the same manner, only a Prorogation makes a Sessions, and puts an end to all Bills not passed the Royal As∣sent.</P>
<P>At the Dissolution of the Parliament the King commonly comes in Per∣son, sending for the House of Com∣mons: After Speeches made, the Lord Chancellor by the King's Com∣mand Declares the Parliament Dissol∣ved.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
<P>The <HI>House of Commons</HI> is not prorogued or adjourned, by the prorogation or adjournment of the <HI>Lords House;</HI> but the <HI>Speaker,</HI> upon signification of the King's pleasure, by the assent of the House of Commons, doth say, <HI>This House doth Prorogue,</HI> or <HI>Adjourn it self.</HI> But when it is <HI>Dissolved,</HI> the House of Commons are sent for up to the Higher House, and there the <HI>Lord Keeper</HI> by the King's Commandment Dissolveth them. And it may be observed, That as the Parliament cannot begin with∣out the King's presence, either in Per∣son or by Representation, so it cannot end without; <HI>Nihil enim tam conveniens est Naturali Aequitati, unumquodque Dis∣solvi eo Ligamine quo ligatum est, Coke's</HI> 4 Inst. 28.</P>

<P>Reason; For when Man was Crea∣ted he received from God a double Eye, the exteriour of the Flesh, where∣by he might see the visible things; and the Interiour of Reason, where∣by he might know the invisible; to the end that, by that of the Flesh, he might behold, know and avoid his visible Enemies, and by that of
<PB N="94" REF="55"/>Reason, be enabled to overcome his Spiritual Enemies, who war against his Soul. And moreover▪ Reason accord∣ing to the Learned is that power of the Rational Soul which discerneth between good and evil, the better by compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng the one with the other, which also chooseth virtue and loveth God: And Reason is divided into two parts, the Superiour and the Inferiour; for the superiour part of Reason tend∣eth only to Divine Eternal things, and endeavoureth and reasoneth, that this is to be done, or not to be done, be∣cause God hath commanded or prohi∣bited it. The inferiour part of Rea∣son is declined, or bent to the Govern∣ment of temporal things; and endea∣voureth or reasoneth to prove by Hu∣mane Laws that this is to be done, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to be done, or that it is honest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dishonest, or that it is expedient, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not expedient for the Common-wealth And in the next place we come to con∣sider and speak of</P>
<P><HI>Conscience,</HI> Which is a word com∣pounded of <HI>Cum &amp; Scientia,</HI> and is as much as to say Knowledge of one thing with another; and is thus said to consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in two things, Knowledg by himself▪ and Knowledge with another: In the first, Conscience importeth a certain
<PB N="95" REF="55"/>natural Act, not of knowing only, but moving also, and also inclineth the Soul to prosecute good and to avoid evil; and in this manner it is accomp∣ted the same as above in Reason, and is also conjoyned to the superiour light of Reason, which is called <HI>Synderesis.</HI> Therefore St. <HI>Jerom</HI> and others, call Conscience it self <HI>Synderesis,</HI> and then Conscience it self is always right. In the second place, Conscience import∣eth more properly Knowledg with another thing, still with some particu∣lar Act; and thus Conscience properly speaking, is no other thing than the applying of a certain Knowledg to some particular Act, from whence it may be deduced, that from the most perfect knowledg of some Law or Science, and the right application of that knowledg to some particular Act, followeth the most pure, perfect and best Conscience; and if there be a defect in knowledg of the truth of that Law, or in the application of the same to some Act, there followeth thereof an Error, or defect of Consci∣ence. And as <HI>Synderesis</HI> delivereth a universal Maxim or Principle, in which it cannot Err, <HI>scilicet;</HI> That an unlaw∣ful thing is not to be done; now it may be assumed that an Oath is unlawful,
<PB N="96" REF="56"/>it being said Math. 5. <HI>Ego autem di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vobis non jurare omnino;</HI> But if any wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hold from these words, that an Oath is lawful in no case, he erreth in Con∣science, because he hath not full know∣ledg of the truth of the said Gospel nor doth confer that place of Scripture with others, in which an Oath is al∣lowed to be lawful: And the reason why Conscience may Err in the afore∣said Assumption and the like, is, be∣cause Conscience is formed from the Assumption of some particular Propo∣sition or Question, under universa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rules of things to be done; and as the light of a Candle is put in a House, that they may see what things are i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the House; so God hath placed Con∣science in the middle of the Rational Soul, as a Light whereby it may dis∣cern what is to be done, or not to be done; and now let us proceed to de∣scribe</P>
<P><HI>Equity,</HI> Which is Justice, weighing all circumstances tempered with the sweetness of Mercy, which ought to be kept in every Law, and this he well understood who said, <HI>Ipsae eteni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Leges cupiunt, ut Jure regantur;</HI> and the Wiseman saith, <HI>Noli esse justus multu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</HI> otherwise <HI>Summa justitia, summa inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stitia fit.</HI></P>
<PB N="97" REF="56"/>
<P>But that we may more clearly de∣clare what Equity is, It is to be known, that because it is impossible to institute any General Rule of Law, which will in no case be defective, therefore <HI>Legi∣slators</HI> attend to that which happeneth in many things, and not to particu∣lar cases, nor indeed can they, since to observe the Sentence of Law in some Cases, is both against the Equality of Justice and Common Good; so that in some Cases it is good, yea absolutely necessary (praetermitting the words of the Law) to follow that which reason of Justice requireth. And to this end Equity is ordained, which is also cal∣led <HI>Epicaya, scilicet,</HI> to moderate the Rigour of the Law, and it taketh not away the very Right, but that which seemeth to be Right, by general deter∣mination of Law. And cases may happen in which the Law of God, and the Law of Reason, would be vi∣olated by the observance of them; as in the Law of <HI>England</HI> there is a gene∣ral Prohibition, that it shall not be law∣ful for any Man to enter into the Ground of another without Authority of the Owner, or of the Law; yet it is excepted, That if Beasts by the High∣way escape into another Man's Corn, he that driveth them may justifie the
<PB N="98" REF="57"/>Entry to fetch them out; and many other such like. And thus it appears, That Equity rather attends the inten∣tion than the words of Law.</P>
<P>And thus having briefly set forth what Equity is, we are next to know that this Court of Extraordinary Juris∣diction grounded thereupon, relieveth none but such who are without remedy in other Courts; For <HI>nunquam decurri∣ter ad extraordinarium, sed ubi defecit Or∣dinarium.</HI></P>
<P>This Court is Superiour to the other Tribunals, that so the rigour of the Law in them might be here moderated, and amended according to Conscience and Equity; and proceeding by Eng∣lish Bill, the Witnesses are examined in private; the Decrees in English or Latin; no Jury, but all Sentences given by the Judge of the Court, much like to the Courts of the Civil Law; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣binds the person only, and not his Lands or Goods.</P>
<P>But referring the full proceeding an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> practise therein, to those Books a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Authors who treat thereof at large We shall next give a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rief accompt of.</P>

<P>Divers Acts of Parliament gave Juris∣diction to this Court, for to punish hor∣rible and enormous Crimes, and other exorbitant Offences in Great Men; but ordinary Offences, and such as may be sufficiently punished by the proceed∣ings of the Common Law, this Court left to the ordinary Courts of Ju∣stice.</P>

<P>THis Court is raised by the Statute of 14. <HI>E.</HI> 3. which followeth in these words:</P>
<P>Item, <HI>Because divers Mischiefs have hapned of late, that in divers places as well in the</HI> Chancery <HI>as in the</HI> Kings-Bench, <HI>the</HI> Common-Bench, <HI>and in the</HI> Exchequer, <HI>before the Justices assigned, and other Justices to hear and determine matters, the Judgments have been delayed sometimes by Difficulty, sometimes by di∣vers Opinions of the Judges, and some∣times for some other Cause. It is assented, established and accorded, That from hence∣forth at every Parliament shall be chosen a Prelate, two Earls, and two Barons, which
<PB N="109" REF="62"/>shall have Commission and Power of the King to hear by Petition delivered unto them, the Complaints of those that will complain to them of such Delays and Grie∣vances made, and they shall have power to come before them at</HI> Westminster, <HI>or elswhere, where the places or any of them shall be; the Tenour of Records and Processes of such Judgments so delayed. and to cause the same Justices to come before them, which shall be then present, to hear their cause and reasons of such de∣lays; which Cause and Reasons so heard by Good Advice of themselves, the Chan∣cellor, Treasurer, the Justices of the one Bench and of the other, and other of the King's Counsel, as many and such as shall seem convenient, shall proceed to take a good Accord, and make a good Judgment; and according to the same Accord so taken, the Tenor of the same Accord, together with the Judgment which shall be Accorded, shall be remanded before the Justices before whom the Plea did depend, and that they shall give Judgment according to the same accord: and in case it seems to them that the Difficulty be great, that it may not well be deter∣mined without Assent of the Parliament, that the said Tenor or Tenors shall be brought by the said Prelate, Earls and Barons in the next Parliament, and there shall be a final Accord taken what Judg∣ment
<PB N="110" REF="63"/>ought to be given in this case; and according to this Accord it shall be com∣manded to the Judges before whom the Plea did depend, that they shall proceed to give Judgment without delay.</HI></P>
<P>Before the making of this Statute delay of Judgments was forbidden, both by the Common Law and by Acts of Parliament. By the Common Law 1. It is required, That <HI>Plena, &amp; celeris, Justitia fiat partibus, &amp;c.</HI> not <HI>plena</HI> alone, nor <HI>celeris</HI> alone, but both <HI>plena &amp; celeris.</HI> All Writs of <HI>Praecipe quod red∣dat</HI> are, <HI>Quod juste sine dilatione reddat, &amp;c.</HI> All Judicial Writs are <HI>Sine dilatione, &amp;c.</HI> 2.

<P>Likewise when Justices or Judges of any Court of Record, or not of Record, give Judgment, and delayed the party of his Execution, the party grieved may have a Writ <HI>De executione Judicij;</HI> by which Writ the Justices or Judges are commanded, <HI>Quod executio∣onem judicij nuper redditi, &amp;c. de loquela quae fuit, &amp;c. per breve nostrum, &amp;c. sine dilatione Fieri fac',</HI> and thereupon an <HI>Alias, Plur',</HI> and <HI>Attachment, &amp;c.</HI> do lye.</P>

<P>That it shall not be commanded neither by the Great Seal, nor by the Little Seal, nor by Letters, nor any other cause to delay Right; and albeit such commandment come, &amp;c. that by them the Justices surcease not to do Right in no manner.</P>
<P>In divers cases the party grieved, shall have an Action for unjust delay.</P>
<Q><HI>Tolle moram, semper nocuit differre paratis.</HI></Q>
<P>But seeing neither the Common Law, nor any of the Acts of Parliament, do extend to <HI>Ecclesiastical Courts,</HI> it is then demanded, What if an Inferiour Ordi∣nary will refuse, or delay to admit, and institute a Clerk presented by the right Patron, to a Church within his Diocess or the like, or delay, or refuse to give Sentence in a Case depending before him?

<P>The particular Commissions of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> are so called in respect of particular Persons, Offences, or Places for which they are granted, whereof you may see Fresh Presidents in the <HI>Register;</HI> 1.

<P>Commissions are like to the King's Writs, such only are to be allowed which have Warrant of Law, and continual Allowance in Courts of Justice.</P>

<P>If any Offence be prohibited by any Statute, and name not in what Court it shall be punished; or if the Statute appoint that it shall be punished in any Court of Record, in both these cases it may be heard and determined before Justices of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer.</HI></P>

<P>If the Justices sit by force of the Commission, and do not adjourn the Commission, it is determined.</P>

<HEAD>The Court of Justices of the Forests.</HEAD>
<P>THe word <HI>Forest</HI> is made by chang∣ing <HI>E.</HI> into <HI>O.</HI> from <HI>Feresta, (hoc est,) Ferarum statio;</HI> it being a Mansion, or safe dwelling of all Beasts of the Wood, and this Forest doth consist of Eight things, <HI>viz. Soil, Covert, Laws, Courts, Judges, Officers, Game</HI> and cer∣tain <HI>Bounds;</HI> of all which we shall speak somewhat in order as they lie. And First of</P>
<P><HI>The Soil</HI> of the Forest, which is Woody ground where there is good Covert, and Fruitful Pastures; and it is not ma∣terial that the Wood belong to the King or another; And when the King will make a Forest, a Writ shall be Issued to the Sheriff of the County where the Forest shall be, to Enquire what place shall be fit to make a Fo∣rest, who thereupon shall take an Inquest and Inquire of the content of the Place and the Bounds, and shall put
<PB N="176" REF="96"/>the same Bounds in certainty, and all he doth he ought to return into the <HI>Chancery,</HI> and when the King is thereof ascertained by such matter of Record, the King shall by Letters Patents com∣mand the Sheriff to make Proclama∣tion, That the place which he hath returned shall be afterwards a Forest, and that none shall Hunt within those Woods they being for his Pleasure to reserve the Wild Beasts, and Game to himself: And this Forest is not necessa∣rily to be made in every County. But in</P>
<P><HI>The Grand Covert,</HI> and Woody Ground where the Beasts may have place of Defence and Food, which are called <HI>Vert,</HI> and are to be preserved to the end that the Game may have both Shelter, and Browze; And yet altho' such Commandment be made by the King as aforesaid, it is no Forest until Wild Beasts are put there, which sort of Wild Beasts are those which are herein after mentioned. And are called</P>
<P><HI>The Game</HI> of the Forest, consisting of Seven kinds, which by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are Beasts of the Forest, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Hart</HI> in Summer, The <HI>Hind</HI> in Winter, with their proceed which are thus Termed; The <HI>Male,</HI> The first year <HI>A. Calf,</HI> The second <HI>A Brooket.</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="96"/>The third <HI>A Spayad,</HI> The fourth <HI>A Staggard,</HI> The fifth <HI>A Stagg,</HI> The sixth <HI>A Hart.</HI> And so afterward the <HI>Female,</HI> The first year <HI>A Calf,</HI> The second <HI>A Brocketts Sister,</HI> The Third <HI>A Hinde.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Buck</HI> in Summer, The <HI>Doe</HI> in Winter, with their proceed thus Term∣ed; The first year <HI>A Fawn,</HI> The se∣cond <HI>A Pricket,</HI> The third <HI>A Sorel,</HI> The fourth <HI>A Sore,</HI> The fifth <HI>A Buck of the First Head,</HI> The sixth <HI>A Great Buck.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The Wild Boar</HI> whose proceed is Termed; The first year <HI>A Pig,</HI> The second <HI>A Hogg,</HI> The third <HI>A Hogg-stear,</HI> The fourth <HI>A Boar,</HI> and after <HI>A Sanglier;</HI> And these four kinds be∣ing wholesome Food for Man, are called Beasts of <HI>Venery,</HI> and <HI>Venison.</HI></P>
<P>But the other Three kinds as,</P>
<P><HI>The Wolf,</HI> The <HI>Marton,</HI> The <HI>Fox,</HI> being <HI>Solivaga,</HI> and <HI>Nociva,</HI> are not called <HI>Veni∣son,</HI> although they are accompted Beasts of the Forest: And befor it be a perfect Forest, the King must appoint certain</P>
<P>Officers, Foresters, or Keepers, in Fee, or for Life, who by <HI>Char∣ta de Foresta,</HI> are to be as many
<PB N="178" REF="97"/>as shall seem sufficient; Four Verder∣ors, Twelve Regarders, Agistators Four, Under Foresters Eight, The Wood-ward and the Game-keeper, or Master of the Game of the Forest. The Forestor is made by Letters Pa∣tents, The Verderors by Writ; How the Rest are made, and for their Au∣thority, See the Books at large. And next we shall briefly describe.</P>
<P><HI>The Courts</HI> of the Forests which are Four, To be held within the Forests at such places, times and in manner, herein after expressed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Court of Attachments,</HI> or the Woodmote Court; This is to be kept before the Verderors, every Forty days throughout the year, and there∣upon it is called the <HI>Forty-day Court:</HI> At this Court the Foresters bring in the Attachments <HI>de Viridi, &amp; Venatione,</HI> and the Presentments thereof, and the Ver∣derors do Receive the same and Inrol them. But this Court can only Inquire and not Convict: But it is observed, That no Man is to be Attached by his Body for <HI>Vert</HI> or <HI>Venison,</HI> unless he be taken with the mayneer within the Forest, or otherwise the Attachment must be by his Goods.</P>
<PB N="179" REF="97"/>
<P><HI>The Court of Regard</HI> or Survey of Dogs, is holden every third year for Expeditation, or Lawing of Dogs.</P>
<P><HI>The Court of Swanimote,</HI> is to be holden before the Verderors as Judges by the Steward of the Swanimote, thrice in the year; and the Foresters ought to present their Attachments at the next Swanimote Court; and the Freeholders within the Forest are to appear at the Swanimote to make In∣quest and Juries: And this Court may Inquire <HI>De superoneratione Forestariorum, &amp; aliorum Ministrorum Forestae, &amp; de eorum Oppressionibus Populo Nostro illatis;</HI> And this Court may not only Inquire, but Convict also, but not give Judg∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>The Court of the Justice Seat,</HI> holden before the Justice in Eyre of the Forest, who hath Authority and Jurisdiction to hear and determine concerning <HI>Vert</HI> and <HI>Venison,</HI> by force of Letters Pa∣tents under the Great Seal; whereof there be Two, One for the Forests on this side <HI>Trent,</HI> the other beyond <HI>Trent;</HI> by which Letters Patents the King doth grant unto him,</P>
<P><HI>Officium Guardiani, Capitalis Justiciarij, ac Justiciarij sui itinerantis, omnium &amp; singularum Forestarum, Parcorum, &amp; Warrenarum suarum, cum suis Pertinentijs

B. <HI>plenam Authoritatem, &amp; Potestatem tenore prae∣dictarum Litterarum Patentium; Omnia, &amp; omnimoda Placita, Querelas, &amp; Causas Forestarum, Parcorum, Chacearum, &amp; Warrenarum praed', tam de Viridi Gram', quam de Venatione, ac de alijs causis qui∣buscunque infra easdem Forestas, Parcos, Chaceas &amp; Warrenas, eveniend', sive emergen' audiend', &amp; determinand', ha∣bend', Occupand', Gaudend', &amp; Exercend', Officio praed' cum pertin' per se, vel per suf∣ficient'.

<P>And this Court of the Justice Seat can∣not be kept oftner than every Third year, and other Justices in <HI>Eyre</HI> kept their Courts every Seventh year: And it must be Summoned Forty days at least before the Sitting thereof; And one Writ of Summons is directed <HI>Custodi Forestae Domini Regis vel ejus Locum tenenti in eadem;</HI> And this Writ consists of two parts: First, To Summon all the Of∣ficers of the Forest, and that they bring with them all Records, &amp;c. Secondly, All persons who claim any Liberties or Franchises within the Forest, &amp;c. and to shew how they claim the same: And this Court of Justice Seat hath Ju∣risdicton to Inquire, hear and deter∣mine
<PB N="181" REF="98"/>two things: First, All Trespasses within the Forest, according to the Laws of the Forest: Secondly, All the claims of Franchises, Priviledges and Liberties within the Forest, as to have Parks, Warrens, Vivaries, to be quit of Asserts, and purprestures, To cut down his own Woods without view of the Forester, &amp;c. And this Chief Justice may by the Statute of 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 35. make his Deputy.</P>
<P>And for Reparation to the Justice Seat, is a Writ of Regard directed to the Sheriff of the County as followeth:</P>
<Q>REx Vic Salutem, Praecipimus tibi quod venire fac' certis die &amp; loco quos ad hoc duxerimus providend', Omnes Foresta∣rios, &amp; Regardatores de Sherwood, ad Regard' faciend' in Forest' praed', ante ad∣veni' Justiciariorum nostrorum de Foresta, &amp; loco Regardatorum nostrorum qui mor∣tui sunt, &amp; infirmi alios Eligi fac' Ita quod <HI>12</HI> sunt in quolibet Regard' &amp; No∣mina illorum imbrevientur: Et Forestar' debent Jurare quod <HI>12</HI> Milites ducent per totam Ballivam suam advidendum omnes Transgressiones quae exprimuntur in Scriptis Capitulorum quae tibi mittimus, &amp; hoc non omittent pro aliqua re: Debent etiam Mili∣tes jurare quod facient Regard' sicut debet fieri, &amp; solet.

<P>For the Duty of Foresters, <HI>Verderours Agistators,</HI> &amp;c. in presenting Offences in the Forest, <HI>Vide Ordinatio Forestae,</HI> 34 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. and <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst. cap</HI> 73.</P>
<P>Any person having right to make any claim may in person, or by At∣torney the first day of the <HI>Eyre</HI> Exhi∣bit his Petition; But he shall be fined if he make false Claim.</P>
<P>The other Writ of Summons is di∣rected to the Sheriff of the County, and the substance thereof is to Summon all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, &amp;c. having Lands, &amp;c. within the Forest, and Four Men of every Village within the Forest, and all others who ought to come before the Justices of the Pleas of the Forest, That they be at <HI>Pickering Launce,</HI> &amp;c. before Four Great Learned Men, Justices in <HI>Eyre</HI> of the Forest, to do what thereunto belongs, and to bring their Regards with all Attach∣ments, &amp;c. To which the Sheriffs make
<PB N="183" REF="99"/>a full Return, &amp;c. And next we are to speak somewhat of</P>
<P><HI>The Laws of the Forest,</HI> which consist chiefly of the Statute <HI>De Charta de Fo∣resta,</HI> and <HI>Ordinatio de Foresta,</HI> 34. E. 1. And Forest Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which are certain and established by Authority of Parliament: Of which you may Read in the Statutes at large.</P>
<P>And of Forests in <HI>England</HI> are Sixty nine; of so great Antiquity, that no Record or History doth mention their Beginnings; Except <HI>New Forest</HI> in <HI>Hamp∣shire,</HI> Erected by <HI>W.</HI> the Conquerour as Conquerour; And <HI>Hampton Court Fo∣rest,</HI> Erected by <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. by Authority of Parliament: And now we come to speak of</P>
<P><HI>The Metes,</HI> and Bounds of the Forest according to <HI>Charta de Foresta, Hugh de Nevill,</HI> and <HI>Bryan de Lisle</HI> were ap∣pointed Commissioners to Inquire what were the ancient Metes, and Bounds of such Forests as <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. Or any King after him had enlarged, which with divers other Perambulations, and Dea∣forestations were made, and are retur∣ned into the <HI>Chancery,</HI> and remain of Record in the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<PB N="184" REF="100"/>
<P>And a Perambulation of the Forest of <HI>Sherwood,</HI> was made the 9 of <HI>Sept.</HI> 30 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. By <HI>Robert Brimesly,</HI> and Fif∣teen others Regarders of that Forest, which Perambulation began from the King's Castle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and from thence proceeding to <HI>Kingsbridge Mea∣dow Gate,</HI> from thence by the <HI>Old Trent,</HI> unto the <HI>Old Watercourse</HI> of <HI>Leen,</HI> &amp;c. round the Forest. And now this leads incidently to speak of</P>
<P><HI>The Purlieus,</HI> which containeth such grounds as <HI>H.</HI> 2. <HI>R.</HI> 1. or King <HI>John</HI> ad∣ded to their Ancient Forests over others Mens grounds; and which were Disa∣forested by force of the Statute of <HI>Char∣ta de Forest' cap.</HI> 1. &amp; 3. and the Peram∣bulations, and Grants thereupon is derived from a French Adjective, and a French Noun, <HI>viz. Pur,</HI> which sig∣nifieth clear, entire and exempt and <HI>Lieu</HI> (that is place) as a place clear and exempt from the Forest: And both of these derived from the Latin adjective, and Noun, <HI>viz. Purus Locus.</HI> And the Serambulation whereby the Purlieu is Deafforested is called in French <HI>Pour∣allèe i. e. Perambulatio.</HI> By this it ap∣peareth, That Chases that never were Forests cannot have any Purlieu, and consequently the case of 16 <HI>Eliz. Dyer</HI> 326. is mistaken, for the Chase of
<PB N="185" REF="100"/><HI>Whaddon</HI> never was a Forest.</P>
<P>The Owners of the Soil within the Purlieu may at their will and pleasure Fell, Cut down, Eradicate, and Stub up all Timber, Trees, Woods, and Un∣der-woods, and convert the same into Arrable Land, or dispose and inclose the same, as if the same had never been Afforested.</P>
<P><HI>The King's Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gers</HI> may Re-chase with their Hounds any Deer out of the Pur∣lieu into the Forest again, and may pre∣sent unlawful Huntings, and Hunters of the Kings Deer within the Purlieu, as in the Night, or at unseasonable Deer, or by one no Purlieu Man. As appears by the Rangers Oath, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst. cap.</HI> 73. And where is no Purlieu, there are no Rangers.</P>
<P><HI>The Kings Game</HI> or <HI>Deer</HI> are not marked, therefore Ranging out of the Forest, and Purlieu (if any be) belonging to the King: Therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Abbot of <HI>Whitby</HI> Huntting in <HI>Whitby Forest,</HI> ad∣joyning to the Forest of <HI>Pickering,</HI> which belonged to the Earl of <HI>Lanca∣ster;</HI> The Sheriff being commanded to Summon the Abbot before the Justices in <HI>Eyre,</HI> 8 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Rot.</HI> 42. He pleaded his Title to the Forest, and that all Abbots of that place by their Grants might with Engins, Netts, &amp;c. take Wild Beasts.</P>
<PB N="186" REF="101"/>
<P>By which it appears, That when the Kings Game range out of the Forest, they are at their natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Liberty, <HI>Et occupanti conceduntur.</HI> And now a word of</P>
<P><HI>The Drifts</HI> of the Forests by the Sta∣tute of 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. all Forests, Chases, Commons, Heaths, Moors and Wast grounds, within <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> are to be driven at the Feast of St. <HI>Michael</HI> yearly, or within 15 days after, or at any other season or time of the year. And the end of these Drifts is, First, To see if those who ought to Common do Common with such Cattel as by Prescription, or Grant they ought: Secondly, That they do not Surcharge: Thirdly, If the Cattel of any Stranger be there who ought not to Common at all.</P>
<P><HI>A Forrest</HI> being as it is described be∣fore, that which hath Power to hold the several Courts before mentioned; it is further to be observed, That if the King having a Forest, grant the same to a Subject in Fee, the Grantee shall have no Forest, because he hath no power to make Justices, and Officers of the Forests to hold Courts, &amp;c. But if the King grant a Forest to a Subject with this further, That upon request made in <HI>Chancery,</HI> he and his Heirs
<PB N="187" REF="101"/>shall have Justices of the Forest, Then the Subject hath a Forest in Law. As the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> had the Forests of <HI>Pickering</HI> and <HI>Lancaster.</HI> And the Ab∣bot of <HI>Whitby</HI> had the Forest of <HI>Whitby</HI> in the County of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Chase</HI> is where there are Keepers only, and no <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Swanimote,</HI> but is governed by the Common Law. And when a Forest is granted by the King to a Subject (without the Power above mentioned to have Justice of the Fo∣rest,) Then that which was a Forest before, shall be said to be a Chase; and a Chase is a certain compass of Ground to nourish and maintain Deer granted by the King in my own Land, and is not inclosed, but lieth open.</P>
<P><HI>A Park</HI> is Land inclosed, and stored with Wild Beasts, which may be had by Prescription, as well as by Grant of the King; and a Park is always in∣closed with some Pale, Wall or the like, and is not open, for if it lie open, it is cause of Forfeiture or Seisure.</P>
<P><HI>A Warren</HI> is where one by Grant of the King, or by Prescription, doth use to have <HI>Pheasants, Partridges, Conies,</HI> and <HI>Hares,</HI> and no other Wild Beast, or Vermin within certain of his Lands. And none may make a Warren but the
<PB N="188" REF="102"/>King, no more than they may make a Forest, or Chase, because it is a special Priviledge which belongeth to the King only: But it may be had by Prescrip∣tion. And in every Warren is a Master, and Servants to attend for the safe∣guard of the Beasts, and Birds of War∣ren; but there is no <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Swanimote</HI> or other Court; For Trespass done in a Warren is punishable by the Common Law; And the King may grant to me Warren which he hath in such his Demesne Land, And also which he hath in Lands of others; And may grant me Waren in my Lands for <HI>Conies</HI> and <HI>Hares,</HI> and to an other that he have Warren there for <HI>Partridge,</HI> and <HI>Phesant;</HI> And if the King grant that none shall Chase or Hunt any Beasts in my Land, it is a good grant for Beasts of Chase, and Warren, and it is not a Warren; but a Free Chase. And for other mat∣ters relating to Forest, Park, Chase, and Warren, <HI>Vide compton's Jurisdiction of Courts</HI> and <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst.</HI></P>
<P>The Beasts of Park or Chase pro∣perly extend to the <HI>Buck,</HI> the <HI>Doe,</HI> the <HI>Fox,</HI> the <HI>Roe,</HI> the <HI>Marton,</HI> but in a com∣mon and Legal Sense, to all the Beasts of the Forest.</P>
<PB N="189" REF="102"/>
<P>The Forest and Chase differ in Of∣fices and Laws, every Forest is a Chase, but every Chase is not a Forest.</P>
<P>Beasts of Forest are properly <HI>a Hart, Hind, Buck, Hare, Boar, Wolf, ut supra</HI> but legally all Wild Beasts of Vene∣ry.</P>
<P>There are both Beasts and Fowls of Warren, as <HI>Hares, Conies</HI> and <HI>Roes</HI> called in Records <HI>Capreoli;</HI> Fowls of two sorts, <HI>Terrestres</HI> and <HI>Aquatiles; Terrestres</HI> of two sorts, <HI>Silvestres</HI> and <HI>Campestres; Campestres</HI> as <HI>Partridge, Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il, Rail,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Silvestres</HI> as <HI>Phesants, Woodcock,</HI> &amp;c <HI>A∣quatiles,</HI> as <HI>Mallard, Hern,</HI> &amp;c Of the Officers of Park, Forest, &amp;c and Condi∣tions annexed and causes of forfeiture, See <HI>Coke</HI>'s 1 <HI>Inst.</HI> 233. <HI>a. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vivarium</HI> is taken for Waters where Fishes are kept, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 162.</P>
<P>It is not lawful for any Man to Erect a Park, Chase or Warren without a License under the Great Seal of the King, who is <HI>Pater Patriae</HI> and Head of the Common-wealth, for the Common Law gave no way to matters of Plea∣sure, (wherein most Men do exceed) for that they brought no profit to the Common-wealth.</P>
<PB N="190" REF="103"/>
<P>Unto a lawful Park three things are requisite. First, A Liberty either by Grant of the King, or by Prescription. Secondly, Inclosure by Pale, Wall or Hedge. Thirdly, Beasts Savages of Park.</P>
<P>By <HI>Stat. Westm.</HI> 1. <HI>cap</HI> 20. Trespasses in Parks and Vivaries shall make good, and high amends according to the manner of the Trepass, have Three years Imprisonment, make Fine to the King, or otherwise find Surety no more to Offend, or else to Abjure the Realm.</P>
<P>If one Hunt in a Park, or Fish in a Pond, altho' he kill no Deer, or take any Fish; yet this is a Misfeazance with∣in this Statute.</P>
<P>And this Act being Affirmative to the Common Law, the party may bring his Action upon this Statute, or may waive the benefit of this Act, and bring his Action of Trespass Generally at the Common Law.</P>

<P>BY Act of Parliament 1 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 16. the King Wills, <HI>That for the better Keeping and Maintenance of the Peace, Good Men and Lawful be Assigned in every County to Keep the Peace.</HI> And thus began this Subordinate Government, for the Tranquility and Quiet of the Realm, which no part of the Christian World can parallel: But referring the Reader to several Acts of Parliament, and Authors who have Treated of their Jurisdiction and Authority both in and out of <HI>Sessions:</HI> We shall only make some short and brief Remarks and Observations thereupon. As, First,</P>
<P>He that is named in the Commis∣mission of the Peace under the Great Seal, is certainly a <HI>Justice of Peace;</HI> Such of these in whom the King more particularly confideth are called <HI>Justices</HI> of the <HI>Quorum.</HI></P>
<P>Their Office and Duty is to be con∣sidered, that some Things cannot be done without Two Justices, and in some cases One or Two must be of the <HI>Quorum;</HI> and when a <HI>Statute</HI> appoint∣eth a thing to be done by Two Ju∣stices; if the Offence be against the <HI>Peace,</HI> one may grant a Warrant to
<PB N="211" REF="113"/>bring the Offender before these Two Justices, or may take Bail for his Ap∣pearance at the next Sessions; or he may bind him to the Good Behaviour, and so to appear at the next <HI>Sessions,</HI> but he may not determine the Matter alone. And whatever one Justice may do, may ever be done by more.</P>
<P>And they may be punished for their Neglect.</P>
<P>Any <HI>Justice</HI> may require any num∣ber of Men to assist him in his Duty, for apprehending all Felons, Murderers, and the like, and such as are able must obey them, or they may be bound to the Good Behaviour, or Fined for their Disobedience. But he cannot give War∣rant to break open any mans House, to Search for a Felon, or stolen Goods, upon a bare Surmise.</P>
<P><HI>A Justice of Peace</HI> may do all that a <HI>Constable</HI> or <HI>Private person</HI> may do, touching <HI>Keeping the Peace</HI> by Common Law.</P>
<P>They are in the Room of the Anci∣ent <HI>Conservators of the Peace,</HI> and have the same power they had.</P>
<P>Where a <HI>Statute</HI> giveth a power in general of any Offence, and doth not mention where it is to be done, it can∣not be done out of the <HI>Sessions of the Peace;</HI> but if it give power to do a
<PB N="212" REF="114"/>Special thing, it may be done out of any Sessions.</P>
<P>They must act cautiously in Execu∣ing the power given them by <HI>Acts of Parliament,</HI> and see that they strictly pursue it; and therefore must observe the words of the Statutes, which are penned diversly, and consider if they are not Repealed.</P>

<P><HI>The Sessions</HI> is a Court where the <HI>Ju∣stices</HI> sit for Execution of their Office; and there are Two kinds of Sessi∣ons.</P>
<P><HI>The General,</HI> or <HI>Quarter-Sessions,</HI> for General Execution of their Commis∣sion over all their Limits, and kept Quarterly, <HI>viz.</HI> In the first Week after <HI>Epiphany,</HI> The first Week after the Clause of <HI>Easter,</HI> The first Week after Translation of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, being the 7th of <HI>July,</HI> And the first Week after St. <HI>Michael</HI> (or more often, if need be,) And in this Court the <HI>Justices</HI> are Judges, of whom there may not be less than Two, whereof one of the <HI>Quorum:</HI> And they ought to sit at the most Principal and Chief Towns, and where it hath been usually held. And all things done before them are of Record, against which no Aver∣ment lieth. And for their several <HI>Pow∣ers</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="116"/>and <HI>Jurisdictions,</HI> besides what is mentioned before, you may read the <HI>Statutes</HI> and <HI>Authors</HI> at large, who treat thereupon; To whom we refer, and pass on to their Power in</P>
<P><HI>The Special Sessions,</HI> which is of Special use, for Ridding the Gaols, and other purposes; And herein they may take as much, and as little business upon them, as they please, and have (unless in some particular cases) the same Power as in their <HI>Quarter-Sessions.</HI> And this <HI>Special Sessions</HI> may be kept at any place, and held at any time, and as long as the Justices think fit, and may be kept by One Justice, or more, who have like power in many cases with the <HI>Justices</HI> in or out of their <HI>Quarter-Sessions;</HI> of which you may read more in Authors at large.</P>
<P>And this <HI>Special Sessions</HI> is also some∣times called <HI>Statute Sessions,</HI> It being en∣joyned by several Statutes, that they with the <HI>Constables</HI> of every Hundred do meet, and that <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> do appear, for deciding Differences, Rating Servant's Wages, and bestowing of People are fit to Serve, and Refuse, or cannot get Masters in Service: And now a word or two of their manner of</P>
<PB N="217" REF="116"/>
<P><HI>Proceeding,</HI> which in an ordinary way lieth in Three things: 1. <HI>Information,</HI> 2, <HI>Hearing</HI> and <HI>Tryal,</HI> 3. In giving <HI>Judgment</HI> and doing <HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Information</HI> the Judges of these Courts take knowledge of Offences, either by presentment of Publick Offi∣cers, as Stewards of Leets, Supervisors of High-ways, Constables, or the like: And these are not sent to the Grand Jury to be found by them, but are a <HI>Perfect Information</HI> of themselves, to which the party accused must answer. And the Information given by the Jury, is Two ways, either by <HI>Indictment</HI> or, <HI>Presentment;</HI> and the <HI>Justices</HI> are to re∣ceive in this such <HI>Indictments</HI> they ought but none other; and they must <HI>ex officio</HI> see they are well drawn.</P>
<P><HI>A Justice</HI> may present Defaults, as of <HI>High-ways, &amp;c.</HI> upon his own View-And any Man may Inform against Offen∣ders without danger: But these <HI>Com∣mon Informers</HI> must be allowed of Re∣cord, and if once turned out, are never again to be admitted; and must prose∣cute within the time limited by the Statute of 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and must bring his <HI>Informations</HI> in the same County, and to these ends must be sworn, 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1.4. And now we proceed to</P>
<PB N="218" REF="117"/>
<P><HI>Hearing</HI> and <HI>Tryal,</HI> in which are in∣cluded the <HI>Calling</HI> the party, his <HI>Ap∣pearance</HI> and <HI>Defence.</HI> The Process for Calling the party upon Indictments for <HI>Treason,</HI> or <HI>Felony,</HI> is 1. <HI>Capias,</HI> 2. <HI>Alias Capias,</HI> 3. <HI>Exigi facias.</HI> If for Indict∣ments of Lesser offences, a <HI>Venire facias,</HI> and if <HI>Sufficient</HI> then <HI>Distringas,</HI> and <HI>Process Infinite.</HI> But if <HI>Nihil habet</HI> be Returned, then <HI>Capias, Alias, Pluries,</HI> and <HI>Exigi facias.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Process</HI> upon any Indictment, or Presentment for an Offence against a Statute, shall be such as the Statute shall direct; otherwise, the <HI>Ordinary Process</HI> of the Common Law. There are other <HI>Processes,</HI> as <HI>Freri Facias,</HI> and <HI>Capias</HI> after Judgment, for doing Execution, 5 <HI>amp;</HI> 6 <HI>Ed.</HI> 6.14. and in some cases <HI>Elegit.</HI> See 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>But touching <HI>Process</HI> Three things must be observed; 1. That no <HI>Process</HI> Issue but upon Inquisition of Twelve Men, or Return of a Sworn Officer, some Special Cases excepted; 2. They are not granted upon Suggestion by Word, or Writing; 3. Nor may <HI>Process</HI> Issue, but <HI>Sedente Curia;</HI> And sometimes the party comes in by</P>
<P><HI>Recognizances,</HI> which are to be Certi∣sied to the next Sessions after they are taken, when and where the Appear∣ance
<PB N="219" REF="117"/>of the party, or his Default of Ap∣pearance is Recorded and Certified. And Bail is to be taken <HI>Quando stat indiffer∣enter,</HI> but not otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>The Justices</HI> cannot Award Process upon Recognizance forfeited, but must certifie the same, and the cause of For∣feiture into some of the Courts of Re∣cord at <HI>Westminster,</HI> That Process may Issue from thence.</P>
<P><HI>Supersedew</HI> from above, must be brought by the party at the Sessions, for if he send, it will scarcely be al∣lowed.</P>
<P>If one be bound to appear at the Quarter Sessions, he must appear there, If at the Sessions; he may appear at any Sessions, <HI>Dalt. J.P.</HI> 237.</P>
<P><HI>Certiorari</HI> coming before the day to remove the Recognizance into the <HI>Chancery,</HI> or <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> will discharge the appearance, <HI>Dalt. J. P.</HI> 237.</P>
<P>After Appearance the Party must either confess, and submit to the Fine, or Traverse the Charge, and if so he must be bound to Prosecute it, unless it be Tryed presently, which must be by Pety-Jury. And this is called an</P>
<P><HI>Arraignment</HI> or Tryal, and if they pass for the King, And find him guil∣ty of the offence, or he confess it, or stand out an Utlary, so that it come to a</P>
<PB N="220" REF="118"/>
<P><HI>Conviction,</HI> Then are the Justices to give Judgment, and see Execution done according to Law, In which they must observe these Rules. First, In giving</P>
<P><HI>Judgment,</HI> They must adjudge Men according to Law, For where the Law appointeth a <HI>Corporal,</HI> they may not inflict a <HI>Pecuniary Punishment, Et sic è converso.</HI> Neither may the change the Degree of Punishment: They have power to inflict Corporal Punishments, as Death, cutting of the Parts of the Body, Burning or Marking, Imprison∣ing, Whipping, Stocking or Cucking Stool, and <HI>Pecuniary Punishments,</HI> as loss of Offices, Lands or Goods, Fines or Is∣sues, Amerciaments: In fame, as to Brand a Man that is Perjured, that his Testimony afterwards shall be of no Credit; They may not set a Fine, or Amerciament but <HI>Sedente Curia,</HI> and all Fines must be reasonable, Where the Stature appoints a Penalty, no o∣ther can be imposed, neither may the Justices mitigate it after the Party is Convicted by Confession, or otherwise; But if the Party Indicted before his Conviction come into Court, and Pro∣test his Innocency; yet <HI>Quia noluit pla∣citare, &amp;c.</HI> he putteth himeself to the grace of the Court, the Justices may,
<PB N="221" REF="118"/>and do usually Impose a Moderate Fine, and by Order forbear the pro∣secution. Other Judgments being rare∣ly or more seldom given, or Executed by Order of these Courts, or the Ses∣sions; But the Pillory, Whipping, or Fine, The Execution of the two first being commonly known, we shall only speake of The</P>
<P><HI>Fine</HI> which, if it be at Common Law, hath Imprisonment incident, till it be paid, yet in such Case the Justi∣ces, may take a Recognizance for Pay∣ment of it, and deliver the Party out of Prison, or they may cause the Clerk of the Peace to Estreat all Fines, and Amerciaments, by Indenture into the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> for the Sheriff to levy, and they are to keep one part of the In∣denture themselves. Thus having giving a Short view of the Jurisdictions, and Proceedings of these Justices in their Sessions, I refer all other Matters con∣cerning them, and their Authority to the Authors, who have written largely upon that Subject.</P>

<P N="1">1st, Time which must be twice in a year, <HI>viz.</HI> within one Month after <HI>Easter,</HI> and one Month after <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> at the Tourn after <HI>Earst,</HI> No Actions Po∣pular are to be inquired after, &amp;c But on∣ly to take their Suit who are Suitors, which at the Sheriffs Tourn are all Men from 12 to 60 years of age within the County, (Ecclesiastical Persons, Peers,
<PB N="226" REF="121"/>and Women excepted) and at the Leet the like Persons within the Precinct, which is called <HI>Suit Real,</HI> by Reason of their Allegiance to which they are Sworn to be true, and Loyal to the King; and to take the view, &amp;c. And at the Tourn, or Leet after <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> then to inquire of such things which are inquirable there.</P>
<P N="2">2ly, The place where the Leet is to be holden, and that must be within the Precinct, or Liberty <HI>in Loco debito, &amp; cosueto,</HI> and if it be done other∣wise, whatever is acted in it is void.</P>
<P N="3">3ly, The Persons who are all Freeholders within the Precinct, or Liberty, and are obliged to come by the Service of their Fees, and all others of fit age, except the persons above mentioned to be ex∣cepted.</P>
<P><HI>The Sheriff</HI> in the Tourn, or Steward in the Leet, as Judge hath a double Au∣thority: 1. Election of Officers: 2. Pu∣nishment of Offenders, And this Punish∣ment of Offenders is in a twofold manner, and in it are to be respected. 1. <HI>Actus Curiae</HI> for Punition of Offences <HI>in Curia,</HI> where the Sheriff, or Steward as Judge, may punish by Fine; without Inquiry by the Country, &amp;c. As if a Juror sworn refuse to make Present∣ment,
<PB N="227" REF="121"/>depart without giving his Ver∣dict, or refuse to be Sworn, the Stew∣ard may impose a reasonable Fine up∣on him: 2. <HI>Actus Patriae</HI> for Punishment of Offences <HI>Extra Curiam,</HI> where the Jurors who are sworn have peculiar Cognizance, and have Authority to Present and to Assess Amerciaments, for them.</P>
<P>And the Sheriff, or Steward by the Statute of 18 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. may Inquire of se∣veral Misdemeanors from the highest Treason, to the lowest Trespass, tho' not here punishable; He may also Im∣pannel a Second Jury, to Enquire of the Defaults and Concealments of the First, and so Fine them for their offence. And for default of Resiants, he may compel a Stranger coming within the view, to be of the Inquest. And the Officers he hath Election of are.</P>

<P>Of the Jurisdiction and Authority of this Court you may Read in the Sta∣tute of <HI>Magna Charta cap.</HI> 35.

<PB N="229" REF="336"/>and the Plaintiff remove the same by a <HI>Pone,</HI> into the <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> that Court shall not grant a <HI>Capias,</HI> for the nature of the Writ doth not warrant a <HI>Ca∣pias,</HI> and the Sheriff could not grant the same, neither doth the Writ of <HI>Justicies</HI> alter the nature of the Court of the County, for therein the Sheriff is not Judge, but the Suitors; and up∣on a Judgment given therein, a Writ of False Judgment doth lie, and not a Writ of Errour. And in divers Real Actions a Writ of <HI>Justicies</HI> doth lie, as in <HI>Breve de Admeasurement</HI> of Dower, of Pasture, <HI>De Nusance,</HI> &amp;c. As by our Books may appear. And Pleas ought not to be hence removed (with∣out cause,) as appears by the Writs of <HI>Pone, Recordare,</HI> The Writ of False Judg∣ment, <HI>Accedas ad Curiam,</HI> which are yet in use.</P>
<P>In this Court upon the Exigent after <HI>Quint' Exact',</HI> The Coroners give Judg∣ment, <HI>Ideo Utlagetur per Judicium Coro∣natoris;</HI> But by this Judgment No Goods are forfeited before the Outlary appear of Record, and that is the Reason, that no Man can Claim the Goods of Out∣laws by Prescription, neither shall such an Outlawry disable the party till the Exigent be returned.</P>
<PB N="230" REF="122"/>
<P>This Court is holden at any place within the County, except in <HI>Northum∣berland, Sussex</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> where it is limited to be held at certain places by Statute; And is to be holden once e∣very Month, counting 28 days to the Month.</P>
<P>No Fine can here be inposed, because it is no Court of Record: But a Man may be there amercied for Contempt, or Disturbance of the Court, In the presence of the Court.</P>

And his Letters Patents bear date commonly the sixth of <HI>Novemb.</HI> unless in case of necessity: And before the next County day after his Election, and Discharge of the old Sheriff, he ought to de∣pute.</P>
<P><HI>A County Clerk,</HI> who according to <HI>Fleta</HI> ought to be Endued with Circum∣spection, Fidelity, Providence, Humi∣lity, Peace, and Modesty, Expert in the Laws and Customs of his Country, and of ability to direct the Bailiffs, and other Ministers in Dubious Things. He may not Practise as an Attorney at the same time, nor Act without consent of Suitors; he must Depute honest able
<PB N="231" REF="122"/>Bailisss to Execute the Process, and Pre∣cepts of the Court, and after Plaints entred (which must be in full County <HI>Sedente Curia,</HI> Except in case of Reple∣vins) he must Issue sufficient Precepts directed to his Bailiff to Attach, or Warn the Defendants to appear at next County Court, and at the Adjourn∣ment of every Court, must appoint a day certain for the next Court; To the intent the Country may know when to Resort thither, to hear the King's Exigents, and Proclamations read.</P>
<P><HI>The Coroner</HI> is a Principal Officer, being chosen in this Court by a Writ <HI>De Coronatore eligendo</HI> directed to the Sheriff, whereupon he is chosen by the Freeholders, or Suitors in full Court, and is there published; and afterwards his Election certified into the <HI>Chancery</HI> by the Sheriff, and the County Clerk Administers to him an Oath for due Execution of his Office: then he Sits there with the Sheriff every County Court, where Exigents and Proclama∣mations being proclaimed five County days, Once in open Sessions, and once at the Church Door, If at the fifth County day the Defendant appear not, the Coroner gives Judgment, That he be out of the King's Protection, and
<PB N="232" REF="123"/>out of the Aid of the Law. A Man being then said to be Outlawed as it were <HI>Extra Legem positus,</HI> because he is supposed to be once Sworn to the Law; But a Woman is said to be wa∣ved, (<HI>Waviatur</HI>) because she was never Sworn to the Law.</P>
<P>The Attorneys may do all things in the Name, and as the Act of him who gave them the Authority, as if he did it himself, For he is <HI>Aliorum Negotiorum Gestor,</HI> and <HI>Qui per alium facit, per seip∣sum facere videtur.</HI> And these ought to be honest, and just, according to their Oath. And ought not to delay their Clients, <HI>(Argenti gratia)</HI> not demand Moneys otherwise than is al∣lowed them by the Court.</P>
<P><HI>The Bailiffs</HI> are Servants and Mini∣sters of the Law, and by Consequence to the party at whose Suit he is to distrain, And therefore ought to be True, Vigilant, and not exoculated with Bribes; Ought to be contented with the Fees allowed, for if they Extort more, or commit any Error contrary to their Precept, they forfeit Forty shillings, by the Stature of 27 <HI>Eliz.</HI> No Bailiff, or other Person, ought to take a Distress or Execute Process, till he be Sworn, but now Experience shews the Contrary.

<P><HI>The Stile</HI> of this Court is, <HI>Curia E. C. Milit is Hundredi sui de B. in Com' Bucks, Tent',</HI> &amp;c. <HI>coram A. B. Senceschallo ibi∣dem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Officers</HI> Incident to this Court, are chiefly the Constables of the Hundred commonly called,</P>
<P><HI>The Chief Constables,</HI> so named, be∣cause the Constables of Towns are called <HI>Petit Constables;</HI> The Constables of the Hundred are Created by the Statute of <HI>Winchester</HI> 13 E. 1. And their Authority thereby limitted to five things: 1st, To make view of Armour: 2ly, To present before Justices Assigned all such Defaults, they see in the Country a∣bout Armour: 3ly, Defaults of Suits of Towns: 4ly, Of High-ways: 5ly, To
<PB N="234" REF="124"/>present such as lodge Strangers in up∣landish Towns, for whom they will not Answer.</P>
<P>And these disperse all Warrants of the Justices of Peace to the Petit Con∣stable; and divers other Authorities are given to them, and the Petit Con∣stables by Acts of Parliament, which they must strictly observe; For that no Officer constituted by Act of Parlia∣ment, may Prescribe as the Officer by the Common Law may.</P>
<P><HI>Term.</HI> 2 <HI>Car. Regis, Fortescu</HI> of <HI>Bucks</HI> Plaintiff, and the Sheriff of the same Defendant, The Plaintiff had divers Hundreds granted to him for Life, Re∣serving a Rent which the Sheriff dis∣allowed, and put in Bailiffs of his own; And the Attorney General was com∣manded to avoid the like in other Counties, for that they were against Law, and belonged to the Office of the Sheriff.</P>
<P>And this division of Counties into Hundreds is very Ancient, and thought to be so called at first, either for con∣taining an Hundred Houses, or an Hundred Men bound to bear Arms, and hath (commonly a Bailiff an An∣cient Officer, but now of small Autho∣rity, And if there be a Bailiff of a Li∣berty, Or a Sheriff's Bailiff of a Hun∣dred
<PB N="235" REF="124"/>Wapentake, or Tything, which hath not Lands or Tenements suffici∣ent within the County, there lieth a Writ <HI>De Ballivo Amovendo,</HI> by the Sta∣tute of 4. <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 9.</P>

<HEAD>The Court Baron.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Stile</HI> of this Court is, <HI>Curia Ba∣ronis A. B. Militis Manerij sui prae∣dicti,</HI> (having the name of the Manor written in the Margent) <HI>Tent' tali die, &amp;c. coram C.D. Seneschallo ibidem;</HI> And being calle <HI>Barons Court</HI> is the same as to say, <HI>Freeholders Court.</HI></P>
<P>This Court is incident to every Ma∣nor, and is of Two natures: The First by the Common Law, and the Suitors thereof are Judges, although the Plea be holden by force of a Writ of Right, and this is called a <HI>Court Baron,</HI> and may be holden from Three Weeks, to Three Weeks: The Second is a Cu∣stomary Court, and that doth concern Copyholderss, And therein the Lord or his Steward is Judge.</P>
<P>And for as much as the Title, or Estate of the Copyholder is entred in the Roll, whereof the Steward de∣livereth him a Copy, he is therefore called <HI>Copyholder.</HI></P>
<PB N="236" REF="125"/>
<P>And as there can be no Court Baron without Freeholders, So no Customary Court without Copyholders; And a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there may be a Court Baron of Free∣holders only, and then the Steward is Register; So their may be a Customary Court of Copyholders only, and then is the Lord or his Steward Judge.</P>
<P>And when the Court Baron is of this Double Nature, The Court Roll con∣taineth matters appertaining to the Court Baron, as also to the Customary Court.</P>
<P>For the Antiquity f this Court, it is to be observed, That by the Laws and Ordinances of King <HI>Alfred,</HI> and others, It appeareth, That the First Kings of this Realm, had all the Lands of <HI>England</HI> in Demesne; And <HI>Les grand Mannors,</HI> and Royalties they Reserved to themselves, and of the Remnant, they (for the Defence of the Realm) En∣feoffed the Barons, (under which Name are comprised all the Nobility,) with the like Jurisdiction the Court Baron now hath.</P>
<P>And this Court was first Instituted for the ease of the Tenants, and for the ending of Suits for Debts and Damages under Forty shillings: And this Court may be held at any place within the Manor, unless a Lord who
<PB N="237" REF="125"/>hath Two or Three Manors, hath usu∣ally kept at one of them Courts for all the said Manors.</P>

<HEAD>The Court of the Coroner.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Coroner</HI> Coronator, is so called, because he deals principally with <HI>Pleas of the Crown,</HI> Or Matters concern∣ing the Crown; And as appears by the Writ <HI>De Coronatore Eligendo,</HI> he is Eli∣gible by the Freeholders of the County, and after he is Elected, the Sheriff gives unto him his Oath duly to Execute his Office; and being thus Eligible (as the Sheriff and Conservators of the Peace were in ancient Times,) they continue notwithstanding the Demise of the King. And of these are Fout in every County; But in the Twelve Shires of <HI>Wales,</HI> and <HI>Cheshire</HI> are but Two, and sometimes Six in a County, and sometimes but one.</P>
<P><HI>The Court</HI> which he holdeth is a Court of Record, And as the Sheriff in his Tourn may Inquire of all Felo∣nies by the Common Law, except the
<PB N="238" REF="126"/>Death of Man; So the Coroner can Inquire of no Felony but the Death of Man, and that <HI>super visum Corporis;</HI> He may also Inquire of the Escape of the Murderer, of Treasure Trove, Deodands, and Wrecks of the Sea.</P>
<P>Besides his Judicial place, he hath also Authority Ministerial as Sheriff, &amp;c. When there is just Exception▪ to the Sheriff, Judicial Process shall be awarded to the Coroner for the Exe∣cution of the King's Writs; in which case he is <HI>Locum tenens Vicecomitis,</HI> and in some especial Case the King's Origi∣nal Writ shall be directed to him.</P>
<P>In ancient time none might have this Office but a Knight, and he must have sufficient Lands within the County, whereof he may answer all People: But more concerning this matter you may see in <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Institutes cap.</HI> 59.</P>
<P>And besides these General Coroners of Counties, there are Special Coro∣ners of Liberties, and Priviledged Places, who have the like Jurisdicti∣on, and Power within those Places, as the other have in the County, <HI>Vide Stat. de Coronatoribus,</HI> 3 and 4. <HI>E.</HI> 1.</P>

<HEAD>The Court of Escheators and Commissioners for finding of Offices.</HEAD>
<P>THis Office is in the Gift of the Lord Treasurer, who grants it by Deed, and he is to continue in his Office but one year, or Once in Three years, and are One in every Coun∣ty.</P>
<P>And this name Escheator cometh from the word <HI>Escheata,</HI> a word of Art derived from the French word <HI>Es∣chear (i. e.) excidere</HI> or <HI>accidere</HI> to hap∣pen, and signifies properly when the Lands by accident Fall to the Lord of whom they are Holden; And then we say the Fee is Escheated.</P>

<P>He ought to be seised of Forty Marks Land, Except in Cities, and Counties Palatine.</P>
<P>In case of Treason or Felony he may find an Office <HI>Virtute Officij.</HI></P>
<P>If he sit by force of a Writ, he ought to take the Inquest within a Month after he deliver the Writ, and he ought to Return the same within a Month after he taketh it either by Writ, or <HI>Virtute Officij.</HI></P>
<P>All Offices found before him, or Commissioners ought to be by Oaths of Twelve Men, every Juror to have Lands of the yearly value of Forty shillings in the same County, and ought to be Indented, and one part Sealed by them, and the other by him, which is to remain with the Foreman of the Jury, and they to be taken in good Towns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He or the Commissioners, can take no Inquest of any, but such are Re∣turned by the Sheriff.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="127"/>
<P>If he or the Commissioners, deny any Person to give Evidence to any In∣quest taken before him, he shall forfeit Forty pounds. If he or they refuse to take a Verdict of the Inquest they for∣feit One hundred pounds to the Party grieved.</P>
<P>An Office found before Commissi∣oners is as forcible, as if it had been found before the Escheator himself.</P>
<P>The Escheator ought to take no Fee but of the King: But if he find an Office by Writ for the King, he shall have a Fee of Forty shillings by the Statute of 23 <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. But if such Lands exceed not in value Five pounds, then he shall take but Fifteen shillings: And if it be found that Lands are holden of a Subject, he ought to take no Fee at all.</P>

<P>He can hold no Plea, but what was holden in the Reign of <HI>E.</HI> 1. and at this day there is not so much occasion for him, or his Authority since Justices of Assize, Justices of Oyer and Ter∣miner, Justices of Peace, and Sheriffs in their Tourns, and Lords in their Leets, may Inquire of False Weights, and Measures.</P>
<P>Of Wine, Ale, Beer, Corn and Grain there ought to be but One Measure, and of all other Merchandize, <HI>per to∣tum Regnum, De Ponderib' vero, sicut de Mensuris.</HI></P>

<P>Another called <HI>Avoir du Pois,</HI> A Pound of this consisteth of 16 Ounces, Every Ounce of 20 Peny weight, E∣very Peny weight 21 Grains and 9/10 of a Grain; It is called <HI>Avoir du Pois,</HI> be∣cause thereby they have full Measure; By this are weighed all Physical Drugs, Wax, Pitch, Tarr, Iron, Steel, Lead, Hemp, Flax, Flesh, Butter, Cheese, and divers other Commodities, and especi∣ally every Commodity subject to Wast; And thereof an 112 Pounds are called an Hundred weight.</P>
<P>There was another weight called <HI>Auncel weight,</HI> by Scales fixed to a Beam or Staff, and by the Hand or Fore∣finger, wherein was much Deceipt, and therefore abolished by several Statute.</P>
<P><HI>Measures</HI> of Troy, are of Three kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Things that are Dry,

<P><HI>Of Liquors</HI> 12 Ounces make a Pint or Pound, and 2 Pints a Quart, and 4 Quarts a Gallon of Wine, which is 8 Pounds Troy weight, 18 Gallons make a Rundlet, 31 Gallons and a Half make Half a Hogshed, 42 Gal∣lons make a Tierce, 63 Gallons a Hogshead, 84 Gallons a Puncheon, 126 Gallons a Pipe, or Butt, and 252 Gal∣lons make a Tun of Wine: Of Ale and Beer 8 Gallons is a Firkin, 16 Gal∣lons is a Kilderkin, 32 Gallons is a Barrel, 63 Gallons is a Hogshead.</P>
<P>The Wine Measure is smaller, than the Ale and Beer Measure, and holds Proportion as 4 to 5, So that 4 Gal∣lons of Beer, are 5 Gallons of Wine; And the Measure of Dry things is greater than the Wine, and lesser than the Ale and Beer Measure, so that the Gallon of this Measure being about 8 Pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Troy weight, is in proportion
<PB N="245" REF="129"/>to the Wine Gallon as 33 to 28, and is in Proportion to the Beer Gallon, as 33 to 35.</P>
<P><HI>Of Longitude,</HI> Latitude, and Profun∣dity 3 Grains of Barley make an Inch, 4 Inches make a Handful, 3 Handful make a Foot, 1 Foot and ½ make a Cubit, 2 Cubits a Yard, 1 Yard and ¼ an Ell, 5 Foot a Geometrical Pace, 6 Foot a Fathom, 16 Foot and ½ make a Perch, Pole, or Rod, 40 Perch make a Furlong, 8 Furlongs make a Mile, which according to the Statute of 11 <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. ought to be 1760 Yards, or 5280 Foot; That is 280 Foot more than the Italian Mile; 60 Miles, or more exa∣ctly 69 English Miles and ½, make a De∣gree, and 360 Degrees, Or, 25020 Miles, Compass the whole Globe of the Earth.</P>

<P>BY <HI>Doomesday-Book</HI> it appears, that the priviledged Ports were but Three at first, <HI>viz. Dover, Sandwich</HI> and <HI>Rumney;</HI> afterward Two more, <HI>Hastings</HI> and <HI>Hythe,</HI> were added to them by the Conqueror.</P>
<P>And these have several Priviledges, as to be free from Burthens, and Charges, and many others; and every of these send Two Burgesses to Parliament, by Name of <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Cinque-Ports;</HI> and although Two more, <HI>viz. Winchel∣sey,</HI> and <HI>Rye</HI> be added, yet they hold their former Names of <HI>Cinque-Ports.</HI> These lying towards <HI>France,</HI> Antiquity provided, they might be securely kept, for performance whereof they have a Governour by his Office, called <HI>Lord Wardon of the Cinque-Ports,</HI> who is <HI>Admiral</HI> also, and hath the Jurisdi∣ction of the <HI>Admiralty</HI> amongst them; He is also <HI>Constable</HI> of <HI>Dover</HI> Castel, of whose Jurisdiction as Constable, <HI>vide Stat' Artic' super Chartas,</HI> and <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 556.</P>
<P>There is a Diversity between the Principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> the <HI>Counties Pa∣latine,</HI> and the <HI>Cinque-Ports:</HI> For <HI>Wales</HI> was no part of <HI>England,</HI> but <HI>Counties
<PB N="257" REF="135"/>Palatine</HI> are parcel of the Realm of <HI>England;</HI> but divided in Jurisdiction, and the <HI>Cinque-Ports</HI> are parcel of the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> and yet <HI>Ubi Breve Domini Regis non currit,</HI> but have not <HI>Jura Regalia:</HI> And therefore regularly no Writ of <HI>Error</HI> did lye of a Judgment in <HI>Wales;</HI> otherwise it is in the Counties Palatine. A. Judgment here of Lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> or in the <HI>County Palatine</HI> is void; but a Judgment given here of Lands in the <HI>Cinque-Ports</HI> is good, if the Priviledge be not pleaded, for they are part of the County. And in the <HI>Cinque-Ports</HI> are Divers Courts; as first,</P>
<P>The Court before the Constable of the Castle of <HI>Dover;</HI> And there be other Courts before the Majors and Jurators within the Ports themselves; and another called <HI>Curia Quinque Portuum apud Shepway.</HI></P>
<P>If any of the King's Courts write to have a Record in the <HI>Cinque-Ports,</HI> or for doing any thing within the same, the Writ is directed <HI>Constabulario Castri de</HI> Dover, <HI>&amp; Guardiano Quinque Portuum.</HI></P>
<P>And all Plaints against the Barons of the <HI>Cinque-Ports,</HI> ought to be deter∣mined at <HI>Shepway</HI> before the Warden of the <HI>Cinque-Ports.</HI></P>
<P>And if an Erroneous Judgment be given in the <HI>Cinque-Ports</HI> before any

<P>These Forces in the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Seconds time, consisted of 4 Regi∣ments of Foot, The King's Regiment 24 Companies and near 1700 Men, The Dukes Regiment 720 Men, Ano∣ther Regiment 600 Men, And the Earl of <HI>Craven's</HI> Regment of 960 Men, And the Earl of <HI>Oxford's</HI> Regiment, consisting of 8.

<P>These Forces were afterwards much encreased, but no Orders are yet set∣led by Act of Parliament for these Land Forces, as there are for Sea Forces. But now they are settled by Act of Parliament to be 7000 natural born Subjects, The Officers included.</P>
<P>Besides these Forces before mention∣ed the Standing Militia of the King∣dom is settled in the King, by Acts of Parliament <HI>Tempore Car.</HI> 2. to be Go∣verned, Ordered, and Enlarged from time to time, as his Majesty shall see occasion.</P>

<P>Besides the Civil Law, The Laws of <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Oleron</HI> are here used, The former for their Excellency being In∣corporated into the Volumes of the Civil Laws, And <HI>Oleron</HI> being an Island in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> belong∣ing to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> King <HI>Richard</HI> the first, there Compiled such Excellent Laws for Sea Matters, that in the Ocean Sea Westward, they had almost as much Repute as the Rhodian Laws in the Mediterranean, and these Laws were called <HI>La Rool de Oleron.</HI></P>
<P>Many Statutes and Ordinances were made by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and other Princes and People, as at <HI>Rome, Pisa Genoa, Marseilles, Barcelona,</HI> and <HI>Messina,</HI> yet that Fragment of the Rho∣dian Law, still extant, holds the Pre∣eminence in Maritime Affairs.</P>
<P>The Customs and former Decrees of the English Court of Admiralty are there, of Force for deciding Contro∣troversies. And under this Court there is also</P>
<P>A Court of Equity for determining Differences between Merchant and Merchant.</P>
<P>In Criminal Affairs, which is most commonly about Piracy, The Proceed∣ing in this Court was by Accusation, and Information, by a Man's own Con∣fession,
<PB N="294" REF="154"/>or by Eye — witnesses he was found Guilty before he could be Con∣demned; But that being found incon∣venient, there were two Statutes made by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, that Crimi∣nal Affairs should be Tried by Witnes∣ses, and Jury, and that by Special Commission from the King to the Lord High Admiral, wherein some of the Judges of the Realm are ever Com∣missioners, and the Tryal according to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> directed by those Statutes as is herein after menti∣oned.</P>
<P>Between the Common Law of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and the Civil Law, there seems to be <HI>Divisum Imperium;</HI> For in the Sea so far as the Low Water mark is coun∣ted <HI>Infra Corpus Comitatus adjacentis,</HI> and Causes there arising determinable by the Common Law: yet when the Sea is full, the Admiral hath Jurisdicti∣on there also (so long as the Sea Flows) over Matters done between the Low Water mark, and the Land, as appears in <HI>Hen.

And it was likewise Resolv'd, That Ambassadors ought to be Free, and Safe in every place by the Law of all Nations; yea, although they be Ambassadors of our Enemies, or a Banish'd Man be sent to the place from whence he is banish'd.

<P><HI>Leagues,</HI> of which are four kinds: I. <HI>Foedus Pacis,</HI> and that a Christian Prince may have with an Infidel, <HI>Si fieri possit quod ex vobis est, cum omnibus hominibus Pacem habeatis;</HI> 2. <HI>Foedus Con∣gratulationis, sive Consolationis.</HI> And this a Christian Prince may make with an Infidel, as <HI>David</HI> did with <HI>Hanon,</HI> I <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.2. 3. <HI>Foedus Commercij, sive Commutationis Mercium.</HI> And this also may be made with an Infidel, as King <HI>Solomon</HI> did with <HI>Hiram,</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI>

<P>But seeing <HI>Foedus Pacis,</HI> and <HI>Foedus Commercij</HI> may be with an Infidel, Pa∣gan, and Idolater, and those Leagues are established by Oaths, whether the Infidel or Pagan may Swear by False Gods, seeing he thereby offendeth the True God by giving Divine Worship to False Gods. St. <HI>Austin</HI> moved by <HI>Publicola</HI> resolveth, That he who taketh the Credit of him that sweareth by False Gods, not for any Evil but Good, doth not joyn himself that Sin of Swearing by Devils, but is partaker of those Lawful Leagues wherein the other keepeth his Faith, and Oath: But if a Christian should any way induce another to Swear by them, herein he should grievously sin; And the League in these Cases is war∣ranted by the Word of God, <HI>Et per Praxin Sanctorum in Sacra Scriptura,</HI>
<PB N="307" REF="160"/>all incidents thereunto are permit∣ted.</P>
<P>In ancient time no Ambassador came into this Realm before he had Safe Conduct: For as no King can come in without the King's License, or Safe Conduct; so no <HI>Prorex, &amp;c.</HI> which re∣presenteth a King's Person can do it. For Safe Conducts see the Writs in the Register, and the Statute of the 15th, 18th and 20th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, with all Incidents thereunto. King <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, that Wise King, would not in all his time suffer Lieges Ambassadors of any Foreign King or Prince within his Realm, nor he any with them; but upon occasion used Ambassadors.</P>
<P>Every Ambassador ought to have Four Qualities,</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Nuntie sis verax, tacitus celer, atque fidelis.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>And of him another saith,</P>

<P>These Societies are no Corporati∣ons, nor have any Judicial Power o∣ver their Members, but have certain Orders among themselves, which have by consent the force of Laws; For Lighter Offences they are only Excom∣muned or put out of Commons, and for Greater they lose their Chambers and be expelled the House, after which they are not to be Received into any of the other three Societies: And these also at Chappel, Hall, or Courts of Ju∣dicature, Wear a Grave Black Robe, and Cap, and at other times walk with Cloak and Sword.</P>
<P>They have no Revenues being not enabled to Purchase, But defray the Charges of the House, with what is paid at Admittances and Quitrents for Chambers, Pensions, and other small Duties.</P>
<P>The whole Company of Gentle∣men in each Society, may be divided into Four parts; <HI>Benchers, Utter Barri∣sters, Inner Barristers,</HI> and <HI>Students.</HI></P>
<PB N="386" REF="200"/>
<P><HI>Benchers</HI> are the Seniors, to whom is Committed the Government of the House, And out of those is yearly cho∣sen a Treasurer, who Receiveth, Dis∣burseth, and Accompteth for all Moneys belonging to the House.</P>
<P><HI>Utter Barristers</HI> are such, who for Learning and Standing are called by the Benchers, to Argue in the Socie∣ty Doubtful Cases, which are called <HI>Moots</HI> from the <HI>Saxon Mote,</HI> or <HI>French Mot,</HI> a Word, and whilst they Argue, Sit Uttermost on the Form's or Ben∣ches, which they call the Bar.</P>
<P>Out of these are chosen Readers for the Inns of <HI>Chancery,</HI> belonging to the respective Inns of Court where in Term time, and Grand Vacations, they argue Cases in the Presence of Attorneys and Clerks.</P>
<P><HI>Inner Barristers</HI> are all the Rest, who for want of Learning or Time are not to Argue; and yet in a <HI>Moote</HI> before the Benchers, Two of these Inner Barristers do for their Exercise, Recite by heart the Pleading of the same <HI>Moot</HI> case in Law French, which Pleading is the Declaration at large of the same <HI>Moote</HI> Case, the one taking the part of the Plaintiff, the other of the Defendant.</P>
<P>They divide the year into three Parts, That is, the Two Learning Vacations,
<PB N="387" REF="200"/>which begin the first <HI>Monday</HI> in <HI>Lent,</HI> and the first <HI>Monday</HI> after <HI>Lommas-day,</HI> and continue Three weeks and Three days each; the Term Times, and the Dead or Mean Vacations.</P>
<P>The Exercises of Study in these Learn∣ing Vacations, are the greatest, which are in manner following:</P>
<P>The Benchers appoint the eldest Ut∣ter Barrister to Read amongst them openly in the Hall, whereof he hath notice half a year before; He then the first day about 8 of the Clock chuseth some Statute, whereupon he grounds his whole Reading for that Vacation, and Declares such Mischiefs, and Inconveniencies as were unprovid∣ed for before the same Act, And then reciteth certain Doubts he hath devi∣sed, that may grow upon the Statute, and declareth his Judgment therein; After which, One of the younger Ut∣ter Barristers repeateth One question propounded by the Reader, and by way of Argument endeavoureth to prove the Readers Opinion to be a∣gainst Law, and after him the Senior Utter Barristers, and Readers one after another according to Seniority do de∣clare their Opinions in the same; and then the Reader who did put the Case, endeavoureth to confute Objections
<PB N="388" REF="201"/>laid against him, and to confirm his own Opinion; After which the Ser∣jeants, and Judges (if any be present) declare their Opinions; Then the youngest Utter Barrister again re∣hearseth another Case, which is prose∣cuted as the former was: And this Exercise continueth daily about three or four Hours.</P>
<P>Out of those who have Read once in the Summer Vacation, and are Ben∣chers, is chosen always one to Read in <HI>Lent,</HI> who observes the like manner of Reading as before is Expressed.</P>
<P>In the mean Vacation after Dinner Cases are Argued, and after Supper, <HI>Mootes</HI> brought and Pleaded by the Inner Barristers, in the Presence of the Utter Barristers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Mooting in the Inns of Court.</HEAD>
<P>IN these Learning Vacations after Supper (or Drinking on Fasting Nights) in the Hall the Reader, with one or two of the Benchers comes in, To whom one of the Utter Barristers propounds some doubtful Case, which being argued by the Benchers, and af∣terwards by him that moved the Case; The Benchers sit down on the Bench at the upper end of the Hall, whence
<PB N="389" REF="201"/>they are called Benchers, And upon a Form in the Middle of the Hall sit Two Utter Barristers, and on each side of them sits one Inner Barrister, who in Law French declareth to the Benchers (as Serjeants do at the Bar in the King's Courts to the Judges) some kind of Action: The one being as it were Retained for the Plaintiff, The other for the Defendant; Then the two Utter Barristers Argue such Questions as are disputable within the Case, after which the Benchers do likewise declare their Opinions, how they take the Law to be in those Que∣stions.</P>
<P>In these <HI>Mootings</HI> the <HI>Junior</HI> argueth first, as do the Judges in the <HI>Exche∣quer Chamber,</HI> and Serjeants in open Courts of Judicature.</P>
<P>The Inner and Utter Barristers Plead here in Law French, and the Benchers in English, and at the Rea∣dings, The Readers Cases are put in English.</P>

<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was an Heptarchy, but now a Monarchy; King <HI>James</HI> the first, endeavoured in Parliament to make a Union of both Kingdoms: But the Judges Resolved, That <HI>Anglia</HI> had Laws, and <HI>Scotia</HI> had Laws: But the new Erected Kingdom of <HI>Britannia</HI> should have no Laws; and therefore, till there was a Union of the Laws, there could be no Union of the King∣doms.</P>
<P>The mighty and ancient Kingdoms of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> were anci∣ently but one; and as their Religion,
<PB N="451" REF="232"/>and Language was one; so there was one kind of Government, and one Law, which Ruled both, with many Unanimous Agreements between them, which evidently appeareth, by many Proofs.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> are divided as the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> into the Common Laws, Acts of Parlia∣ment and Customs; their Common Laws being principally contained in two Books, One called <HI>Regiam Maje∣statem,</HI> because it beginneth (as doth <HI>Justinian</HI>'s <HI>Institutes</HI>) with those words, And agreeth in substance with our <HI>Glanvil,</HI> and most commonly <HI>de Verbo in Verbum,</HI> and many times our <HI>Glan∣vil</HI> is cited therein. The second Book is called <HI>Quoniam Attachiamenta,</HI> it beginning with those Words.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Descent of the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of Lands to Subjects, is the same with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> They have the like High Court of Parliament, consisting of Lords Spirituals, Lords Temporal and Commons. But of latter times, the Lords Spiritual chuse eight Temporal Lords, and the Lords Temporal eight Spiritual Lords. These Sixteen make choice, of eight for Counties, and eight of Cities, and Burroughs, in all
<PB N="452" REF="233"/>32; But whatsoever is agreed upon by them, the King or his High Commis∣sioner doth allow or disallow, by mo∣ving of the Scepter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They have the same De∣grees of Nobility, as, Dukes, Marquis∣ses, Earls, Viscounts and Barons.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The same great Officers as Chancellor, Treasurer, Lord Privy Seal, Secretary, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> The same Ministers of Ju∣stice, as Sheriffs, Coroners, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> The same Laws for the most part, appropriated unto <HI>Eng∣land, viz.</HI> Tenant by the Curtesy, because they had Laws as <HI>England</HI> had.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> The like Writs as <HI>De Recto, Assisa de Novel Disseisin, Mort de Ance∣stor, de Gard, de Ideot' inquirend', Reple∣giar', Attachm', &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> They agree with <HI>Magna Gharta,</HI> concerning Ward-ships.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> With <HI>Charta de Foresta,</HI> for it is lawful for Bishops, Earls and Ba∣rons, coming or returning through the Kings Forests, at the Kings Com∣mand to kill own or two Beasts, in the sight of the Forester; Or other∣wise in his Absence to blow his Horn, that he appear not to take it Thie∣vishly.</P>
<PB N="453" REF="233"/>
<P><HI>Eleventhly,</HI> The Lord of whom the Land is holden <HI>per Antiquius Feoffa∣mentum</HI> shall have the Wardship of the Body.</P>
<P><HI>Twelfthly,</HI> The Sheriffs should cause the Acts of Parliament, to be pro∣claimed as heretofore in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirteenthly,</HI> The Sheriffs there have Inheritance in their Office, as some∣times in <HI>England,</HI> and still in <HI>Cumber∣land</HI> they have.</P>
<P><HI>Fourteenthly,</HI> The same Vocables of Art, are used in both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>But by reason of their Acts of Parli∣ment, which in many Points have alter∣ed, diminished and abrogated, many of the old, and made new Laws, and other Proceedings, the distinct King∣doms, as they now stand, have many different Laws, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 345, 346.</P>
<P>By the Statute of 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1.2. An Authority is given to certain Commis∣sioners of both Houses of Parliament, to Treat with certain Commissioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> concerning the Settlement of an Union and Peace between the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>By the Statute of 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. Laws of Hostility, and the dependences thereof between the two Nations
<PB N="454" REF="234"/>of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> are Re∣pealed.</P>
<P>Felonies Committed by English Men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be Tried in <HI>Cumber∣land, Westmorland</HI> or <HI>Northumberland,</HI> before Commissioners and Jurors of <HI>England;</HI> for which see more in the Statute.</P>
<P>By the Statute of 7 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1.1. If an English Man shall commit Felony in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and then fly into <HI>England,</HI> the Justices of Assize or one of them, the Justices of Gaol Delivery in their Gaol Delivery, or four of them, or the Justices of Peace in Sessions, or four of them, may send the Offender into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> to be Tried.</P>
<P>By the Statute of 19 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 13. Twelve persons to be nominated by the King, shall be Commissioners for this Kingdom; who, or five, or more of them, after the 10th of <HI>January</HI> 1667, and before the 25th of <HI>March</HI> 1688; and so from time to time may meet at such place in <HI>England</HI> as the King shall appoint, with Commissioners for the Realm of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and Treat and Determine concerning the Liberty of Trade between the two Kingdoms, by suspending Impositions, &amp;c. charged since the 25 of <HI>March,</HI> in 12 year of the Kings Reign; upon Commodities
<PB N="455" REF="234"/>of the Growth or Manufacture of ei∣ther Kingdom, or of any of the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, or other Commodi∣ties Exported out of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland;</HI> their Determinations to be reduced into Writing, under the Hands and Seals of the Commissioners, and being Ratified by the King, shall be in force for a year, from the Date of such Ratification, or to the end of the next Session of Parliament.</P>
<P>By the Statute of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 9. Persons to be nominated by the King under the Great Seal, or so many of them as shall be appointed to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> shall have power to Treat with Commissioners, to be Authori∣sed by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> con∣cerning an Union of the Realms, and such other Matters as they shall think fit, for the Kings Honour, and Good of both Kingdoms. Their Pro∣ceedings to be reduced into Writings or Instruments Tripartite, one part whereof to be presented to the King, another to the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and a third to that of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Provided that nothing to be agreed on by them, shall be of force till con∣firmed by Act of the Parliament of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<PB N="456" REF="235"/>
<P>By the Statute of 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1.1. He that is once Tried in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall not be called in Question again for the same Offence.</P>
<P>By the Statute of 2 <HI>Ed.</HI> 4.8. Mer∣chandize carried into, or brought out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the Isles thereof, shall be first brought to <HI>Berwick,</HI> in pain to forfeit the same.</P>
<P>As the Law hath wrought four Unions. <HI>1st,</HI> The Union of both King∣doms, under one Natural Liege Sove∣reign King, being so acknowledged by the Act of Recognition. <HI>2ly,</HI> The Union of Liegeance and Obedience of the Subject of both Kingdoms, due by the Law of Nature to their Sovereign. <HI>3ly,</HI> The Union of Protection of both Kingdoms, equally belonging to the Subjects of either of them. <HI>4ly,</HI> The Union of the three <HI>Lyons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with that one of <HI>Scotland</HI> United and Quartered in one Escutcheon.</P>
<P>So the Law doth make four Sepera∣tions. <HI>1st, England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> remain several and distinct Kingdoms. <HI>2ly,</HI> They are Governed by several Judi∣cial, or Municipal Laws. <HI>3ly,</HI> They have several distinct and seperate Par∣liaments. <HI>4ly,</HI> Each Kingdom hath se∣veral Nobilities; For albeit a Postnatus in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or any of his Posterity be
<PB N="457" REF="235"/>the Heir of a Nobleman of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by his Birth Legitimated in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> yet he is none of the Peers or Nobility of <HI>England,</HI> for his Natural Ligeance and Obedience due by the Law of Nature, maketh him a Sub∣ject, and no Alien within <HI>England:</HI> But that Subjection maketh him not Noble within <HI>England,</HI> for that Nobi∣lity had its Original by the Kings Cre∣ation and not of Nature. More of which matter you may Read at large here∣after in <HI>Ireland:</HI> And that the highest and lowest Dignities, as a King, and that of a Knight are nevertheless universal, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 7 <HI>Rep.</HI> 15. <HI>Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Case.</HI></P>
<P>In ancient time part of <HI>Scotland</HI> (be∣sides <HI>Berwick</HI>) was within the Power, and Ligeance of the King of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> yet was Governed by the Laws of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Case in 42 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.2. Ruleth it, That so many as were Born in that part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that was under the Ligeance of the King, were no Aliens, but inheritable to Lands in <HI>England;</HI> yet was that part of <HI>Scotland</HI> in ano∣ther Kingdom governed by several Laws: And certainly, if they were Natural Subjects in that Case, when the King had but part of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="458" REF="236"/>when the King hath all <HI>Scotland,</HI> they shall be Natural Subjects, and no Aliens.</P>
<P><HI>Barwick</HI> is no part of <HI>England,</HI> nor Governed by the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> yet they that have been Born there, under the Obedience of one King, are Natural Born Subjects and no Aliens.</P>
<P>There were sometimes in <HI>England,</HI> whiles the Heptarchy lasted, seven se∣veral Crowned Kings, of several and distinct Kingdoms; but in the end the <HI>West Saxons</HI> got the Monarchy, and all the other Kings melted (as it were) their Crowns, to make one Im∣perial Diadem for the King of the <HI>West Saxons</HI> over all: Now when the whole, was made the actual and real Ligeance and Obedience of one King, they were all Natural born Subjects, and capable of, and Inheritable unto any Lands in any of the said King∣doms. Of all which matters and things last above mentioned, you may read at large in <HI>Coke</HI>'s 7 <HI>Report, Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Case.</HI></P>
<P>By the Statute of 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. For Re∣peal of Hostile Laws, It is Enacted, That no <HI>Englishman</HI> shall be sent out of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> for any Offence done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> until the
<PB N="459" REF="236"/>Realms be made one in Laws and Go∣vernment.</P>

<PB N="493" REF="253"/>of Excessive heat, and thought it a great Solecism to believe the Earth was round: For holding which Opi∣nion, 'Tis said Pope <HI>Zacheus</HI> was so Zealous against Bishop <HI>Virgil,</HI> That he Sentenced him to be cast out of the Temple and Church of God, and to be deprived of his Bishoprick for this perverse Doctrin, That there were An∣tipodes, or People whose Feet are placed against ours; although this dis∣covery of <HI>America</HI> hath fully confirm∣ed these Opinions, and the yearly compassing the World evidenceth, the necessity and certainty of Inhabitants living on all Parts of the Earthly Globe.</P>

<P>After the first discovery, the busi∣ness of Trading thither was laid aside for many years, in the mean time the <HI>Normans, Portugals</HI> and <HI>Britains</HI> of <HI>France</HI> resorted to it, and changed the Names which had been given by the <HI>English</HI> to the Bays and Promontories, but the <HI>English</HI> not willing to Relinquish their Pretensions in 1583.

<P>After the first Discovery, <HI>Virginia</HI> cost no small Pains and Experience before it was brought to perfection, with the loss of many English Lives.

<PB N="511" REF="262"/>But upon several Misdemeanors and Miscarriages, in 1623 the Patent was made void, and hath since been free for all His Majesty's Subjects to Trade to.

<P>This Country is well Watered with many great and swift Rivers, that lose themselves in the Gulph or Bay of <HI>Chesapeak,</HI> which gives Entrance into this Country as well as <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> be∣ing a very large and capacious Bay, and running up into the Country Northward above 200 Miles.

By which Letters Patent, the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are to be in force in <HI>Carolina:</HI> But the Lords Proprietors have power, with the Consent of the Inhabitants, to make By Laws for the better Government of the said Province; so that no Money can be Raised, or Law made, without the Consent of the Inhabitants, or their Representatives. They have also power to appoint and impower▪ Governours, and other Magistrates, to grant Liberty of Conscience, make Constitutions, &amp;c.
<PB N="514" REF="264"/>with many other great Priviledges, as by the said Letters Patent will more largely appear. And the said Lords Proprietors have there settled a Con∣stitution of Government, whereby is Granted Liberty of Conscience, and wherein all possible Care is taken for the equal Administration of Justice, and for the lasting Security of the Inhabi∣tants, both in their Persons and Estates, by the Care and Endeavours of the said Lords Proprietors; and at their very great Charge Two Colonies have been settled in this Province, the one at <HI>Albe∣marle,</HI> in the most Northerly part, the other at <HI>Ashley</HI> River, which is in the Latitude 32 Degrees odd Minutes.</P>
<P>Care is taken by the Lords Proprie∣tors, That no Injustice be done the Natives, (who are here in perfect Friendship with the <HI>English,</HI>) in order to which is established a particular Court of Judicature, to Determine all Differences.</P>
<P>The Lords Proprietors do at present Grant to all Persons that come to Inha∣bit there, several reasonable Advantages to all Conditions of Men, and sell their Land to any after the Rate of 50 Pounds for 1000 Acres. The manner of Purchasing is, The Party seeks out a place to his mind, (not pos∣sessed

<PB N="516" REF="265"/>
<P>The Island of more Fame and Greatness than all the rest, and to which the Name of <HI>Bermudaz</HI> is most properly ascribed, is scituated in the Latitude of 32 Degrees and 30 Min. North. The Air is sound and healthy, very agreeable to the <HI>English</HI> Bodies, the Soil as fertile as any, well Watered, plentiful in Maize, of which they have Two Harvests yearly; that which is sowed in <HI>March</HI> being cut in <HI>July,</HI> and what is sowed in <HI>August</HI> is mowed in <HI>December.</HI> No Venemous Creature is to be found in this Isle, nor will Live if brought thither; and besides these Advantages, it it so fenced about with Rocks and Islets, that without knowledge of the Passages, a Boat of Ten Tun cannot be brought into the Haven, yet with such knowledge there is Entrance for the Greatest Ships. The <HI>English</HI> have since added to these Natural Strengths such Artificial Helps by Block Houses, Forts and Bulwarks in convenient places, as may give it the Title of <HI>Impregnable.</HI></P>
<P>It was first Discovered rather Acci∣dentally than upon Design, by <HI>John Bermudas</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> about 1522, and thereupon a Proposition made in the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI> for settling a Plan∣tation therein, as a place very conveni∣ent
<PB N="517" REF="265"/>for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet in their Return from the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> by the Streights of <HI>Bahama;</HI> yet was it neglected, and without any Inhabitants, till the like Accidental coming of Sir <HI>George Sum∣mers,</HI> sent to <HI>Virginia</HI> with some Com∣panies of the <HI>English</HI> by the Lord <HI>De la Ware</HI> in 1609, who being Shipwreck'd on this Coast, had the Opportunity to survey the Island, which he so well liked, that he Endeavoured to settle a Plantation in it at his Return in 1612. The first Colony was sent over under <HI>Richard More,</HI> who in Three years Erected 8 or 9 Forts in convenient pla∣ces, which he planted with Ordnance. In 1616 a New Supply was sent over under Captain <HI>Tucker,</HI> who apply'd themselves to sowing of Corn, setting of Trees brought thither from other parts of <HI>America,</HI> and Planting that gainful Weed <HI>Tobacco.</HI> In 1619. the Business was taken more to Heart, and made a Publick Matter, many Great Lords and Persons of Honour being interested in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it; Captain <HI>Butler</HI> was sent thither with 500 Men. The Isle was divided into Tribes or Counties, a Burrough belonging to each Tribe, and the whole reduced to a settled Go∣vernment both in Church and State, according to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> After
<PB N="518" REF="266"/>this, all succeeded so well, that in 1623 there were said to be 3000 <HI>English,</HI> and Ten Forts, whereon were planted Fifty Pieces of Ordnance, their Numbers since increasing daily, both by Chil∣dren born within the Island, and Supplies from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>All the Isles together represent an Half-Moon, and Inclose very good Ports; as the <HI>Great Sound, Harrington Inlet, Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Paget</HI>'s Bay, with <HI>Dover,</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> Forts, having their Names from the Noble Men, who were Undertakers therein. The great∣est Isle is called St. <HI>George</HI> five or six Leagues long, and almost throughout not above a quarter or half a League broad. The Air is almost constantly Clear, (Except when it Thunders and Lightens) is extream Temperate and Healthful, few dying of any Disease but Age; so that many remove from <HI>Eng∣land</HI> hither only to enjoy a long and healthful Life, and after having conti∣nued there, are fearful of Removing out of so pure an Air. The very <HI>Spi∣ders</HI> here are not Venemous, but of di∣vers curious Colours, and make their Web so strong, that oftentimes small Birds are entangled and caught therein. Their <HI>Cedar</HI> Trees are different from all others, and the Wood very sweet.</P>

<P>THE manner of Debates or pas∣sing of Bills into Acts, is thus. It is the Practice of each House to debate not only of what the King hath proposed, but of any other Lay-matters, unless their Sovereign shall expresly forbid the same, as heretofore hath sometimes been done.</P>
<P>It is free for any Man of the Parlia∣ment, or not of the Parliament, to get a Bill drawn by some Lawyer, and
<PB N="536" REF="275"/>give the same to the Speaker, or Clerk of the Parliament to be presented at a time convenient, and this Bill may be put first either in the Lords House or the Commons House.</P>
<P>Whatever is proposed for a Law, is fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t put in Writing, and called a Bill; which being read commonly after Nine of the Clock in a full Assembly, it is either unanimously Rejected at first, or else allowed to be Debated, and then it is committed to a certain Number of the House presently nominated and called a Committee. After it hath been amended, and twice read two several Days in the House, then it is Ingrossed, that is, written fair in Parchment, and read the third time another Day, and then if it be in the Lords House, the Lord Chancellor, in the Commons House the Speaker demandeth if they will have it put to the Question, Whe∣ther <HI>a Law or no Law?</HI> If the Major Part be for it, there is written on the Bill by the Clerk, <HI>Soit Baille aux Com∣munes,</HI> or <HI>Soit Baille aux Seigneurs,</HI> re∣taining still in this and some other things about making Laws, the Custom of our Ancestors, who were generally skilled in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue.</P>
<PB N="537" REF="275"/>
<P>Note, <HI>That when the Speaker finds di∣vers Bills prepared to be put to the Que∣stion, he gives notice the Day before, That on the Morrow he intends to put such Bills to the Passing or third Reading, and desires the special Attendance of all the Mem∣bers.</HI></P>
<P>Note also, <HI>That if a Bill be Rejected, it cannot be any more proposed during that Session.</HI></P>
<P>A Bill sent by the Commons up to the Lords, is usual (to shew their Re∣spect) attended with Thirty or Forty of the Members of the House: As they come up to the Lords Bar, the Member that hath the Bill, making three pro∣found Reverences, delivereth it to the Lord Chancellor, who for that purpose comes down to the Bar.</P>
<P>A Bill sent by the Lords to the Com∣mons, is usually sent by some of the Masters of the Chancery, or other Per∣son, whose Place is on the Wooll-sacks (and by none of the Members of that House) and they coming up to the Speaker, and bowing thrice, deliver to him the Bill, after one of them hath read the Title, and desired it may be there taken into Consideration; if af∣tewards it pass that House, then is writ∣ten on the Bill, <HI>Les Communes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t as∣sentez.</HI></P>
<PB N="538" REF="276"/>
<P>When any one in the Commons House will speak to a Bill, he stands up uncovered, and directs his Speech only to the Speaker; then if what he delivers be confuted by another, yet it is not allowed to answer again the same Day, lest the whole time should be spent in Debate. Also if a Bill be debating in the House, no Man may speak to it in one day above once.</P>
<P>If any one speak words of Offence to the King's Majesty or to the House, he is called to the Bar, and sometimes sent to the Tower. The Speaker is not al∣lowed to perswade or disswade in pas∣sing of a Bill, but only to make a short and plain Narrative, nor to Vote, ex∣cept the House be equally divided.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Parliament ordina∣rily assemble not, though many times they continue sitting long in the After∣noon.</P>
<P>Committees sit after Dinner, where it is allowed to speak and reply as oft as they please.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> By Death or Demise of the King, the Parliament is <HI>ipso facto</HI> dissolved.</P>
<P>Anciently, after every Session of Par∣liament, the King commanded every Sheriff to proclaim the several Acts, and to cause them to be duly observed; yet without that Proclamation, the Law
<PB N="539" REF="276"/>intending that every one hath Notice by his Representative, of what is trans∣acted in Parliament; of later times since Printing became common, that Custom hath been laid aside.</P>

<P><HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester</HI> Uncle to King <HI>Edward</HI> the 5th.

<PB N="545" REF="279"/>and good Conscience in Barr, or Discharge of the said Debt or Duty, and the same Matter sufficiently prove in the said Court, then the said Court shall have Power and Authority to judge and allow the said Proof, and clearly acquit and discharge such Per∣son and Persons. Also Lands chargeable to the King's Debts in the Seisin and Possession of divers and sundry Persons, the same shall be wholly and intirely, and in no wise severally liable to the payment of the said Debt and Duty: But in the said Act of 33 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. All manner of Estate, Rights, Titles and Interests as well of Inheritance as Free∣hold, other than Joyntures for Term of Life are excepted.</P>

<PB N="546" REF="280"/>King by Rent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might be brought in∣to this Court.</P>

<P>Some are of Opinion, that a Court of Equity was holden in the <HI>Exchequer-Chamber</HI> before the Stat. of 33 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. And then it must be a Court of Equity by Prescription; for we find no former Act of Parliament that doth create and establish any such Court: And if it be by Prescription, then Judicial Presidents in Course of Equity must guide the same.

<HEAD>The Court of First Fruits and Tenths Ecclesiastical.</HEAD>
<P>A Court of First-fruits and Tenths was raised by Stat. 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap.</HI> 45.

<P>These were granted to the Crown by the Stat. of 26 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap.</HI> 3. But all the Clergy were Exonerated and Discharg∣ed thereof afterwards, <HI>Anno</HI> 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3 <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> and <HI>Mary, Cap.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>The Statute of 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. revived, and First-fruits and Tenths of the Cler∣gy reunited to the Crown <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Eliz.
<PB N="549" REF="281"/>Cap.</HI> 4. But no Court is revived, but First-fruits and Tenths to be within the Rule, Survey and Government of the <HI>Ex∣chequer,</HI> and created a new Office and Officer, <HI>viz.</HI> a Remembrancer of the First-fruits and Tenths of the Clergy, who taketh all Compositions for the said First-fruits and Tenths, and maketh Process against such as pay not the same.</P>
<P>First-fruits, or <HI>Annates, Primitiae</HI> are the First-fruits after Avoidance of eve∣ry Spiritual Living for one whole Year, except Vicaridges not exceeding Ten Pounds, and Parsonages not exceed∣ing Ten Marks, but all are to pay Tenths.</P>
<P>Ecclesiastical Livings were sometimes valued by a Book of Taxation made in 20 <HI>E.</HI> 1. which remaineth in the <HI>Ex∣chequer;</HI> and by another Taxation in 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. which also remaineth in that Court. And according to that latter Taxation are the Values of Ecclesiasti∣cal Livings computed for the First fruits and Tenths.</P>
<P>What is of Record concerning First-fruits we will thus briefly relate.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>Rot. Claus. m.</HI> 4. The King forbiddeth <HI>H. P.</HI> the Pope's Nuncio to Collect First-fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Rot. Par.</HI> 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. <HI>Nu.</HI> 43. It is En∣acted, That the Pope's Collectors should not from thenceforth levy any Money within the Realm for First-fruits of any Ecclesiastical Dignity by any Provision from <HI>Rome</HI> upon Pain of the Statute of

<P>19 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Tit. Jurisdiction</HI> 22. The Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> had by Prescription time out of mind, First-fruits within his Diocesse of all Churches after every A∣voidance. But these also were given to the Crown by the Statute of 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Tenths Ecclesiastical, <HI>Decimae,</HI> these are the Tenth part of the Value of all Ecclesiastical Livings yearly payable to the King, his Heirs and Successors by the said Satute of 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. and 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> to be valued as is abovesaid.</P>
<P>These the Pope (as the Canonists hold) pretended to have <HI>De Jure Divino,</HI> as due to the High Priest, by pretext of these Words; <HI>Praecipe Levitis atque de∣nuncia, cum acceperitis à filiis Israel De∣cimas quas dedi vobis, Primitias earum offerte Domino, id est, decimam partem decimae, ut reputetur vobis in Oblationem Primitiarum tam de areis, quam de tor∣cularibus &amp; universis quorum accipietis Primitias offerte Domino, &amp; date ea Aaron Sacerdoti.</HI> But the Parliaments in 25 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. and 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. were not of Opinion that these Tenths did belong to the Bi∣shop of <HI>Rome,</HI> as by the several Pream∣ambles thereof appeareth, which we have added; for that we have endea∣voured

<P>Where the last Incumbent leaves the Tenth unpaid, the Successor may Di∣strain the said Incumbents Goods found upon the Benefice, and keep them un∣til the Incumbent (if Living) or (if Dead) his Executors, Administrators, or other Owner of the said Goods shall satisfie the Arrears; which if not done within 12 days the Goods may be Ap∣praised upon Oath, and Sold for the satisfying thereof, together with reason∣able Costs, and in Case there be no Distress, the Successor may prosecute the Incumbent (if Living) or (if Dead) his Executors, Administrators, or other Owner of his Goods, by Bill in <HI>Chan∣cery,</HI> or Action of Debt, for the Reco∣very of the same.</P>
<P>By <HI>Stat.</HI> 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 22.

<HEAD>To the Court of Ancient Demesne.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Book of Doomes-day it self, it appeareth that it was made in the time of the Conquerour.</P>
<P>And as Tenants in Ancient Demesne are careful to preserve their Pri∣viledges; so the Lord is as careful to preserve his Seigniority, and the Tenure of his Tenancy in Ancient Demesne. And therefore, if the Tenant Levy a Fine, or suffer a Recovery in the Court of <HI>Common Pleas, &amp;c.</HI> whereby for a time the Land is become Frankfee, the Lord by a Writ of Disceit, may not only restore himself to his true Seigniority, but utterly avoid the Fine, and restore his Tenant against the Recovery, and his own Fine to the Land again in his former Estate; and the Reason thereof is, for that the Recovery or Fine was not suffered, or Levied before a Com∣petent Judge in the Right Court, which ought to have been in the Court of Ancient Demesne: And therefore, af∣ter the Reversal in the Writ of Dis∣ceit, it is now <HI>Tanquam coram non Judice,</HI> and the Parties to the Fine, or Recovery shall be Fined and Impri∣soned <HI>pro deceptione Curia.</HI></P>
<PB N="560" REF="287"/>
<P>But if in a Writ of <HI>Right Close</HI> in Ancient Demesne, the Demandant maketh his Protestation to Sue in the nature of Assize of <HI>Mortdancester,</HI> the Tenant Pleads in Abatement of the Writ, and the Writ by Judg∣ment is abated; the Demandant brings a Writ of false Judgment, wherein the Writ is affirmed to be good; the Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> shall proceed as the inferiour Court should have done; and altho' that Judgment be given to recover the Land in the <HI>Common Pleas;</HI> yet the Land is not Frank-see but re∣mains Ancient Demesne, because the beginning and foundation thereof was in Ancient Demesne.</P>
<P>They may Levy a Fine in Ancient Demesne, which by Custom is said to be a Bar of an Estate Tail; but cer∣tainly that will not hold.</P>
<P>If the Tenant remove the Plea, for the cause mentioned in the <HI>Recordare,</HI> he may come into the Kings Court, and Assign other Cause: And Twenty, if he hath, to maintain the Jurisdiction of the Kings Court, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst. cap.</HI> 58.</P>
<P>All those Manors which were in the Hands of St. <HI>Edw.</HI> the Confessor, were caused to be Written in Doomes-day Book, <HI>Sub Titulo Regis,</HI> and all the
<PB N="561" REF="287"/>Lands holden of the said Manors, are held by Tenure of Ancient Demesne.</P>
<P>And the Tenants shall not be Im∣pleaded out of the said Manors, and if they be, they may shew the Matter, and abate the Writ. But if they An∣swer to the Writ, and Judgment be given, then the Lands become Frank-fee for ever.</P>
<P>And Tenants in Ancient Demesne which held their Lands by Soccage; That is, by Service with the Plow, are called <HI>Sockmans,</HI> That is, Tenants or Men that hold by Service of the Plow, or Plowmen, for <HI>Sock</HI> signifies a Plow. <HI>Terms del Ley.</HI></P>
<P>All the Lands that are in the Kings Hands are Frank-fee, and Pleadable at the Common Law, <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 35.</P>
<P>The Manor it self, and the Demesne Lands within the Manor is Pleadable at Common Law; and a Man ought to Sue his Action for the Manor, and for the Lands which are Parcel of the Manor at the Common Law, and in the <HI>Common Pleas, F. N. B.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>But if a Man Sue for Lands holden of the Manor in the Hands of a Free Tenant, he ought to Sue the Writ of <HI>Droit Close,</HI> directed to the Lord of the Manor, and there he shall make his Protestation, to Sue in the same
<PB N="562" REF="288"/>Court, the same Writ in the nature of what Writ he will Declare: And if false Judgment be given, the Tenant or Demandant may Sue a Writ of false Judgment, <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>But he, who holdeth in Ancient De∣mesne by Copy of Court Roll, at the Will of the Lord, who is called Tenant by base Tenure, (and ancient∣ly Tenure in Villenage,) if he be ou∣sted of his Lands, he shall not have this Writ of <HI>Droit Close,</HI> but ought to Sue by Bill in the Court of the Lord of the Manor, and shall make Prote∣station to Sue there in nature of what Writ he will; but he shall not have a Writ of false Judgment or other Re∣medy, but to Sue to the Lord by way of Petition, <HI>F. N. B. fo.</HI> 26, 27.</P>
<P>And when the Writ of <HI>Droit Glose</HI> cometh to the Lord or his Bailiffs, he ought to hold a Court, and if he will not hold it, The Demandant may Sue a Writ out of <HI>Chancery</HI> commanding him to hold it, and thereupon an At∣tachment directed to the Bailiff, return∣able in the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> or <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> whereupon he shall recover Da∣mages or the like, against the Bai∣liff.</P>
<PB N="563" REF="288"/>
<P>And if the Lord oust his Tenant that holds in Fee, he may have a Writ of <HI>Droit Close,</HI> or an Assize, or other Writ at Common Law, against the Lord for those Lands, <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 26.</P>
<P>No Lands are Ancient Demesne, but Lands holden in Soccage. And</P>
<P>By this Tenure is intended, that the Tenants shall do the Service of the Plow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>viz.</HI> To Plow and Till the Lords Lands, to Mow the Lords, Meadows, and such like Services as are for the maintaining of the Kings Su∣stenance or Victuals, and his Subjects. And for such Services the Tenants have divers Liberties and Priviledges in Law, as to be quit of Toll and Taxes, if not charged upon Ancient Demesne, To be free from Charges of Knights of Parliament, and not to be put on En∣quests out of their Manors, unless they have other Lands, &amp;c. And if the Lord Distrein for other Service or Customs than they are used to do, they may have a <HI>Monstraverunt, F. N. B. fo.</HI> 30, 31.</P>
<P>The Lord shall not answer to At∣tachment upon the <HI>Monstraverunt,</HI> be∣fore the Court be certified by the Trea∣surer, and Chamberlain of the <HI>Exche∣quer,</HI> whether the Land be Ancient Demesne, <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 35.</P>
<PB N="564" REF="289"/>
<P>The Lord shall have a Writ of Dis∣ceit against him, who levieth a Fine of Demesne Lands, and he who is Tenant shall avoid the Fine; But if he Release to him in Possession it shall bind, <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 216.</P>
<P>Lands in Ancient Demesne may be extended, by the Statute <HI>de Mercatori∣bus,</HI> 13 <HI>E.</HI> 1. <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 397. And upon Statute Staple. And general Statutes extend to it, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 270.</P>

<P>The Demandant in a Writ of <HI>Droit Close,</HI> cannot remove the Plea out of the Lords Court for any cause, &amp;c. nor can the Tenant remove the Plea out of the Ancient Demesne, if not for Causes which prove the Land to be Frank-fee, and not Ancient De∣mesne; And when the Court is re∣moved by <HI>Recordare,</HI> he ought to shew some Special matter to prove the Land to be Frank fee, and not Ancient De∣mesne; otherwise, the Plea shall be sent back unto the Lords Court: But to shew a Fine levied in the Kings

<P>In a <HI>Replevin,</HI> Writ of <HI>Mesne,</HI> Writ of <HI>Ward,</HI> in Accompt against Guar∣dian in Soccage, Ancient Demesne is a good Plea for the Appearance and Common Intendment, that the Realty doth come in Debate; so in Accompt against a Bailiff. For it is brought for the Issue and Profits of the Land, which is Ancient Demesne, which ought to be determined in the Court of Anci∣ent Demesne.

<P>THE first Statute made against Bankrupts, was against Strangers, <HI>viz.</HI> against <HI>Lombards,</HI> who after they had made Obligations to their Credi∣tors, suddainly escaped out of the Realm without any Agreement made with them. It was therefore Enacted, 51 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. That if any Merchant of the Company knowledge himself bound in that manner, that then the Com∣pany shall answer the Debt; so that another Merchant which is not of the Company, shall not be thereby Grie∣ved or Impeached; neither do we find either any Complaint in Parliament, or Act of Parliament made against
<PB N="574" REF="294"/>any English Bankrupt, until the afore∣said Statute of 34. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. when the English Merchant had rioted in three kinds of Costliness, <HI>viz.</HI> Costly Building, Costly Dyet and Costly Apparel, accom∣panied with neglect of his Trade and Servants, and thereby consumed his Wealth.</P>
<P>He is called in Latin <HI>Decoctor à Deco∣quendo,</HI> for consuming his Estate in Riotous and Delicate Living.</P>
<P>The Law provideth, That the Com∣missioners upon the Statute of Bank∣rupts ought to have Three qualities, <HI>viz.</HI> Wisdom, Honesty and Discretion; Which if it be observed, it is the best means for the due Execution of the said Statute, and the Life of these Laws doth consist in the due Execution thereof: And for such Commissioners, if any Action shall be brought against them, &amp;c. for doing of any thing by force of the said Statutes, they may plead Generally, and not be driven to any Special Pleading, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Inst. cap.</HI> 64.</P>

It is Enacted, That if any Person (Sub∣ject or Denizen) exercising Trade doth depart the Realm, conceal him, or her self, take Sanctuary, suffer him or her self to be Arrested, Outlawed or Imprisoned without just Cause, to the Intent to Defraud Creditors, being also Subjects born, he shall be Deemed a Bankrupt.</P>
<P>And that the Lord Chancellor or Keeper upon a Complaint in Writing against such Bankrupt, may appoint Honest and Discreet Persons to take such Order with the Body of such Bank∣rupt, wheresoever found, and also with the Lands (as well Copy as Free) Here∣ditaments, Annuities, Offices, Wri∣tings, Goods, Chattels and Debts, wheresoever known; which the Bank∣rupt hath in his own Right, with his Wife, Child or Children, or by way of Trust to any Secret use; and to cause the said Premisses to be Searched, Rented, Appraised and Sold for the pay∣ment of the Creditors, Ratably accord∣ing to their Debts, as in the Discretions of such Commissioners, (or the most part of them) shall be thought fit.</P>

<HEAD>To the Court of Commissioners for Ex∣amination of Witnesses.</HEAD>
<P>THe Commissioners albeit named by the Parties reciprocally, ought to stand indifferent, and do their ut∣most endeavour to find out by due Ex∣amination the whole Truth, and to suppress no part thereof, for their Au∣thority is to that end meerly, and wholly from the King by force of his Commission.</P>
<P>There may be Propriety, but no Su∣periority amongst Commissioners.</P>
<P><HI>Witness,</HI> Is derived of the Saxon word <HI>Weten i. Scire, Quia de quibus sciunt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te∣stari debent. Et omne Sacramentum debet esse certae Scientiae.</HI></P>
<P>In Latin a Witness is called <HI>Testis à testando, &amp; testari est Testimonium perhi∣bere; unde Regula juris, Plus valet unus
<PB N="579" REF="296"/>oculatus Testis, quam auriti decem: Testis de visu praeponderat alijs.</HI></P>
<P>And Oath ought to be accompanied with the fear of God, and Service of God for the Advancement of Truth, <HI>Dominum Deum tuum timebis, &amp; illi soli servies, &amp; per nomen illius jurabis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Testis falsus non erit impunitus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nocte dieque suum gestat sub pectore Testem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vox simplex nec probationem facit, nec praesumptionem inducit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Testibus deponentibus in pari numero, dignioribus est credendum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tessemoignes ne poent testifie le negative, mes l'affirmative.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Allegans contraria non est audiendus, verum vero consentiens est falsum nec vero nec falso.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Juramentum est indivisibile, &amp; non est admittendum in parte verum, &amp; in parte falsum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Allegans suam turpitudinem non est au∣diendus,</HI> Coke's 4 Inst. 279.</P>
<P>Antiquity did add <HI>hijs Testibus</HI> in the Continent of the Deed, after the <HI>In cujus rei Testimonium</HI> written with the same Hands the Deed was, which Witnesses were called, The Deed read, and then their Names entred. And this is called <HI>Charter Land,</HI> and by the <HI>Saxons Bookland,</HI> which Clause of
<PB N="580" REF="297"/><HI>hijs Testibus</HI> continued until and in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. but is now whol∣ly ommitted.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Stat.</HI> 12. <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 2. Process should be awarded against the Wit∣nesses, and therefore that Statute was but in Affirmance of the Common Law; But the delay therein was great, And sometimes (tho' rarely) the Ex∣ceptions to those Witnesses being found true, they were not to be Sworn at all, neither to be joyned to the Jury nor as Witnesses; As if the Witness were Infamous, as Attainted of False Verdict, or Conspiracy, at Suit of the King Convict of Perjury, Forgery, Felony or Praemunire, or by Judgment lost his Ears, or stood upon the Pillory or Tumbrel, or been <HI>Stigmaticus</HI> where∣by they become Infamous for some Offences, <HI>Quae sunt minoris Culpae sunt Majoris Infamiae.</HI> If a Champion in a Writ of Right become recreant, he thereby loseth <HI>Liberam Legem,</HI> becomes Infamous and can be no Witness, or if a Witness be an Infidel, or <HI>non sanae memoriae,</HI> or not of Discretion, or a Party interested, or the like.</P>
<P>But a Man may be challenged to be of a Jury, that cannot be challenged to be a Witness; and Witnesses cannot prove a Negative; of all which you
<PB N="581" REF="297"/>may Read more in <HI>Coke</HI>'s 1 <HI>Inst.</HI> 6. <HI>a. b. Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 662.</P>
<P>When Tryal is by Witnesses, regu∣larly the Affirmative ought to be pro∣ved by 2 or 3 Witnesses: But when it is by Verdict of 12 Men, There the Judgment is not given upon Witnesses, or other kinds of Evidences; But up∣on the Verdict, and upon such Evi∣dence as is given to the Jury, they give their Verdict.</P>
<P><HI>Bracton</HI> saith, There is <HI>Probatio du∣plex,</HI> That is, <HI>Viva,</HI> as by Witnesses, <HI>Viva Voce; &amp; Mortua,</HI> as by Deed, Wri∣tings and Instruments.</P>
<P>And many times Jurors are (with o∣ther matter) much induced by presump∣tion, which is of three sorts, <HI>Praesump∣tio Violenta,</HI> which is many times <HI>Plena probatio, Praesumptio probabilis,</HI> which mo∣veth litle, and <HI>Praesumptio levis seu te∣meraria,</HI> which moveth not at all.</P>
<P>If all the Witnesses to a Charter, or Deed be Dead, then violent presump∣tion which stands for a proof, is con∣tinual and quiet Possession.</P>
<P>A Wife cannot be a Witness, for or against her Husband, for they are <HI>Duae animae in carne una;</HI> And in some Cases Women by Law are wholly excluded to bear Testimony.</P>
<PB N="582" REF="298"/>
<P>A Party cannot be Witness against the Usurer. And he that Challengeth a Right to the thing in Demand, can∣not be a Witness for that he is a Par∣ty in Interest, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 1 <HI>Inst.</HI> 6. <HI>a. b.</HI> 25. <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>Witnesses <HI>Viva voce,</HI> whereupon Jurors try matter of Fact, are much better Courses than the Conscience of one particular Man, Guided by Paper Proofs, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 111.</P>
<P><HI>Bracton</HI> saith, <HI>Post intervallum tempo∣ris Accusator non erit audiendus, nisi di∣cere potest se fuisse justis rationibus impe∣ditum.</HI></P>
<P>In Misprision of Treason, there ought to be two Witnesses as well upon Tryal, as upon Indictment.</P>
<P>By <HI>Stat.</HI> 1 &amp; 5 <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. None shall be Indicted, Arraigned, Condemned, Convicted or Attainted of any the Treasons aforesaid, or other Treasons unless accused by two lawful Witnes∣ses, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 24, 25.</P>

<P>In some Cases, as in Dower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Courts of Common Law Judge by Witnesses, but they must ever be <HI>Viva Voce.</HI></P>
<P>An Alien (if not Infidel) may be a Witness; and how Examiners and Wit∣nesses ought to behave themselves, See <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4. <HI>Inst.</HI> 278, 279.</P>
<P>Proof is intended Tryal by Verdict, and an Extent and Appraisement ought to be <HI>per Sacramentum duodecim</HI> and not by the Sheriffs; But if the Sheriff upon a <HI>Fieri facias</HI> Sell all the Interest the Defendant had in the Land, the Sale is good notwithstanding misrecital of the Term; The like if he do not take upon him to recite the Term, other∣wise than <HI>pro Termino diversorum anno∣rum ex tunc ventur'</HI> it is good, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 74.</P>

<P>BY <HI>Stat. de Visu Franc.</HI> 18 <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. be∣fore mentioned, and divers other Statutes, the Court of the Leet may en∣quire of several Offences; and amongst the things whereof the Steward of the Leet hath Cognizance, and wherewith the Jury is to be charged, some are such as may be there enquired of, as High-Treason, Petit Treason, Felonies, Burg∣laries, Wilful Burners of Houses or Barns adjoyning thereunto, by Night; or Stacks of Corn, Robbers of Chur∣ches and Chappels, Takers of Doves out of Dovehouses or young Pigeons, or Hawks out of their Nest in the Night, or Fishes out of Ponds, Stews or Trunks, in the Night, Stealers of Tame Deer, marked Swans, or Peacocks; Breaking of Prison by Felons, Rescuers of Felons, and the like; and their Ac∣cessaries before and after the Felony done. Of all which the Jury must make Presentment, and this Present∣ment is to be transmitted to Superior Courts, as to the Justices of Goal-Deli∣very, or Justices of Peace in their Ses∣sions.</P>
<PB N="598" REF="306"/>
<P>And other things whereof this Court hath perfect Cognizance, and that may be enquired of, and punished here in this Court, are, 1. By Common Law, as the Defaults of Officers and Suitors in doing their Suit to this Court; as if any living within the Precinct of the Law∣day, be not returned of the Decenary, or being returned, does not appear: Or, if any above Twelve years of Age have lived within the Leet, and had not ta∣ken the Oath of Allegiance, he was to have been presented here. And if any such Person had come to this Court, the Steward ought to have given him this Oath. If any Customs or Profits, as Treasure Trove, Waif, Estray, or Wreck be withheld from the Lord of the Leet; or if any claim any Royal Franchise, or levy any new Franchise, or abuse any old Franchise within the Leet. All common and popular Nu∣sances or Grievances done to the Kings Subjects, by Purprestures made in any Land, Wood or Water, by Walls, Hedges, Ditches, or Houses, made up or broken down, by straightning, turn∣ing, stopping, surrounding, or other∣wise hurting the common Ways, Brid∣ges or Waters; by poisoning or corrupt∣ing the Air by laying of any Carrion or Filth, by selling of corrupt and un∣wholsom
<PB N="599" REF="306"/>Provision, or by the breaking of the due Assize of Bread, Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By Erecting Cottages, and suffering In∣mates, by not scowring Ditches, or not repairing Highways and Bridges, and the like. And for all these, be the Of∣fend or one Man, or a whole Parish, he or they may be Amerced; and the Jury may order the Reforming of them under a Pain. And all great Affrays, Outcries and Bloodsheds, and such like popular Trespasses, which are Trespas∣ses by the Common Law. Riots, Routs, and unlawful Assemblies at the Com∣mon Law, are punishable in this Court; and for this the Offendors are to be Amerced according to Discretion; but this must be reasonable, and the reason∣ableness tryable and avoidable by Plea or Judgment of the Court in which the Suit depends. Evil Members, and persons of ill Behaviour that are dangerous to the Neighbours, as Malefactors in Parks, such as take Doves by Engines, such as are common suspected Thieves, or that are the common Messengers of Thieves, the common Drunkards, the common Haunters of Alehouses or Taverns, not having whereon to live; Nightwalkers and Day-sleepers, that live idlely, that have no Estate, yet fare well; Eves-droppers, common Hedge-breakers,
<PB N="600" REF="307"/>common Peace breakers, Railers and Sowers of Discord between Neighbours, Keepers or Haunters of Bawdy-houses, common Scolds, common Barretors, common Usurers, Innkeepers, who do commonly entertain Thieves and suspi∣cious Persons, knowing or suspecting them to be so; and such as do remove Bounds or Landmarks between Parishes, Hundreds or Counties, but not such as remove Bounds between Persons only. These last the Steward of this Court heretofore might have bound to the Peace or Good Behaviour, but at this day he can only by the Presentment of the Jury Amerce them, or make way to have them bound to their Good Be∣haviour by a Justice of Peace. Con∣stables, Tythingmen, Haywards, Ale∣conners, Bailiffs, and such like Officers, which are chosen and sworn in this Court, if any such being chosen, refuse the Office, and to take the Oath, or accepting, doth not execute his Office duly, or misbehave himself therein, as if Constables and Tythingmen do not take care of Watch and Ward, keeping the Peace, raise Hue and Cry, and pur∣sue it for the apprehending Felons, when any Felony is done, or raise Hue and Cry when none is done; or do not punish Rogues and the like, or Tything∣men,
<PB N="601" REF="307"/>Chief Pledges, Surveyors of High∣ways, Searchers and Sealers of Leather, and such like Officers as do not their Duty. All that Rescue Persons or Things, taken in a course of Law; as Rescuers of Persons Arrested; or Goods or Cattel Distreined; Pound-breakers and the like. The lack of Stocks, Pil∣lory and Tumbrel, Cucking-stool, or Common Pound. All that use Deceit in Buying and Selling, that Sell false Wares for good, especially if it be that which is to be Eaten or Drunk; That Sell by false Weights and Measures, Inn-keepers, Victuallers, Brewers, Ba∣kers, Fishers, Poulterers, or Fishmon∣gers, that Sell that which is unwhol∣some for Food, or Sell at unreasonable Prices; Bakers and Brewers that do not keep the Assize of Bread and Beer, and Millers that take excessive Toll. Fore∣stallers, Regrators and Ingrossers, may be punished in this Court by the Com∣mon Law. And Usurers as Enemies to Trading. But in these and such like Cases, the Penalty of the Statute can∣not be Imposed; for Stewards have no Power by the Statutes, but it is punished here as an Offence at the Com∣mon Law, before the Statute which doth remain still, and for these the Offender is to be amerced.</P>
<PB N="602" REF="308"/>
<P N="2">2. By Statute Law are punishable Tanners, Curriers, Shoomakers, Search∣ers and Sealers of Leather; such as offend about Fish, Malt, Archery, Guns, Unlawful Games, Artificers and Labourers, Musters, Highways, Horses, Hostlers and Victuallers, about the price of Wine, Pheasants, Partridges, Tra∣cers of Hares, Hunting in Corn, about Cottages and Inmates, about Drinking and Drunkenness, Watering of Hemp where Cattle Drink, about Rogues, Crows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of all these and some others, this Court may Inquire by Au∣thority of divers Acts of Parliament; for all which see <HI>Shepheard's Court-keep∣ers Guide, Coke's</HI> 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> and other Au∣thors, and the Statutes at large.</P>
<P>The Articles to be enquired of by the Leet, by 18 <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. were inquirable therein by the Common Law.</P>
<P>This Court cannot take Indictments of any Felony, for the death of a Man, or in any other case where it hath not Cognizance; And if it do it is void, and it seems the Judge may be punished for it; Neither can it take a Presentment of an offence done against a Parish, or against a Man. The like of Presentments of any thing, which is not within the Jurisdiction of the Court.</P>
<PB N="603" REF="308"/>
<P>The Jury in this Court may make By-Laws, and enquire of the breach of them, as they have been used to do. And for Cawseys, High-ways and Bridges, the greater part may bind the rest without consent, 44 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.19.</P>
<P>But no By-Law can be made to Im∣prison Refusers; but Distress, and Acti∣on of Debt in this Case, is the proper Remedy for a Penalty Imposed, or Breach of a By-Law, <HI>Coke's</HI> 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 64. <HI>Shepheard</HI>'s <HI>Court-keepers Guide, cap.</HI> 39.</P>

<P><HI>Visus Franc' Pleg' i. e. Libere Fide jus∣sores,</HI> was instituted for the keeping of the King's Peace, that every Freeman at his Age of 12 years, should in the Leet (if he were in any) or in the Tourn take the Oath of Allegiance to the King, and that Pledges or Sureties should be found, for his Truth to the King, and to all his People, or else to be kept in Prison: This Frank-pledge consisted most commonly of ten Hous∣holds, which the Saxons called <HI>Theo∣thung;</HI> in the North parts they call him
<PB N="604" REF="309"/><HI>Tenementale,</HI> in other places of England <HI>Tything,</HI> whereof the Masters of the Nine Families who were bound, were of the Saxons called <HI>Freeborgh,</HI> which in some places is to this day called <HI>Freebarow, i. e.</HI> Free Surety, or Frank-pledge. And the Master of the 10th Houshold, was by the Saxons called by divers Names, viz. <HI>Theothungmon,</HI> to this day in the West called <HI>Tythingman</HI> and <HI>Tihenheofod,</HI> and <HI>Freoborher i. e. Ca∣pitalis plegius,</HI> chief Pledge; and these▪ Ten Masters of Families, were bound one for anothers Family, that each Man of their several Families should stand to the Law, or if he were not forth coming, that they should answer for the Injury or Offence by him Committed, <HI>De eo autem qui fugam ce∣perit, Diligenter inquirend' si fuerit in Franco Plegio, &amp; Decenna, tunc erit De∣cenna in misericordia coram Justiciarijs nostris, quia non habent ipsum Malefa∣ctorem ad rectum,</HI> Bracton Lib. 3. Fo. 124.</P>
<P>Hereby it appeareth, That the Pre∣cinct of this Frank-pledge was called <HI>Decenna,</HI> because it consisted most com∣monly (as hath been said) of Ten Housholds, and every Man of these several Housholds, for whom the Pledge or Surety are taken were called <HI>De∣cennarij,</HI>
<PB N="605" REF="309"/>because every particular Per∣son in the Kingdom was of one <HI>De∣cenna</HI> or other, which names are con∣tinued as Shadows of Antiquity to this day; <HI>Ordeine fuit ancientment, que nul ne demurrast en le Realm, sil ne fuit en dizein &amp; plevy de Frank hommes, ap∣pent aux vise de viewer un fois per an' Frank Pledges &amp; les Plevys,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>By the due Execution of this Law, such Peace was Universally holden within this Realm, as no Injuries, Ho∣micides, Robberies, Thefts, Riots, Tu∣mul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, or other Offences were Com∣mitted; so as a Man with a White Wand, might before the Conquest safely have Ridden with much Money about him, throughout <HI>England</HI> with∣out any Weapon, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 73.</P>
<P>In the Leet or Tourn, the Suitors might be compelled to be Sworn as well for the King, as between Party and Party; for they are not <HI>Liberae tenentes</HI> in respect of Tenure, but do their Suit in respect of Resiance; Also the Leets and Tourns are the Courts of the King, and of Record, and the Court Baron, and Hundred Court of other Lords, are not Courts of Record, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 143.</P>
<PB N="606" REF="310"/>
<P>The Oath of Allegiance then and there taken to the King is thus expres∣sed by <HI>Britton</HI> cap. 12. <HI>Voillons nous que trestouts ceux de</HI> 12 <HI>ans, desouth nous fa∣cent le serement que ils serr' Foial &amp; Loial, &amp; que ils ne serr' Felons ne aux felonies assentaunts.</HI> And in cap. 24. to this effect; <HI>You shall Swear, That from this day forward you shall be True and Faithful to our Sovereign Lord King</HI> E. <HI>and his Heirs, and Truth and Faith shall bear of Life and Member, and Terrene Honour, and you shall neither know nor hear of any Ill or Damage intended unto him, that you shall not Defend.</HI> So help you Almighty God, <HI>Et les Seints.</HI></P>
<P>But this is now obsolete, being al∣tered by several Statutes. See <HI>Coke's Rep. Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Case.</HI></P>
<P>The Court of the Tourn of the County, and of the Leet or View of Frankpledge are very Ancient; for of the Tourn you may Read among the Laws of King <HI>Ed. Statutum est quod ibi (scil' apud le Folkmote) debent populi omnes, &amp;c. convenire, &amp; se Fide &amp; Sa∣cramento non fracto ibi in unum, &amp; simul confederare, &amp;c. ad defendendum Reg∣num, &amp;c. Una cum Domino suo Rege, &amp; Terras suas, &amp; honores illius omni fideli∣tate cum eo servare &amp; quod illi, ut Domi∣no suo Regi intra, &amp; extra Regnum vni∣versum
<PB N="607" REF="310"/>Britanniae fideles esse velint, &amp;c. Hanc Legem invenit Arthurus (qui quon∣dam fuit inclytissimus Rex Britonum) &amp; ita consolidavit &amp; confederavit Regnum Britanniae universum semper in unum: Hujus Legis Authoritate, expulit Arthurus praed' Saracenos &amp; inimicos à Regno; Lex enim ista diu sopita fuit, donec Edgarus Rex Anglorum, qui fuit avus Edwardi Regis, illam excitavit, &amp; erexit in Lucem &amp; per totum Regnum firmiter observari prae∣cepit: Et hujus Legis Authoritate Rex Etheldred' subito uno &amp; eodem die per universum Regnum Danos occidit.</HI></P>
<P>And because this Court, or View of Frankpledge or Leet, was by the King divided and derived from the Tourn, and granted to the Lords to have the view of the Tenants, and Resiants within their Manor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so as they should have the same Justice, as they had before in the Tourn, without any charge or loss of Time; from thence came the Duty in many Leets to the Lord <HI>de Certo Lete,</HI> towards the charge of obtaining the Grant of the said Leet.</P>
<P>So likewise, and for the same Reason were Hundreds, and Hundred Courts divided and derived from the County Courts; and this the King might do, for the Tourn and Leet, are both the King's Courts of Record: And as the
<PB N="608" REF="311"/>King may Grant a Man to have Power <HI>Tenere placita,</HI> within a certain Precinct, and before certain Judges, and in a manner Exempt it from the Jurisdicti∣on of his Higher Courts of Justice, so might he do in Case of the Tourn, and Hundred Courts; So as the Courts and Judges may be changed, but the Laws and Customs, whereby the Courts proceed, cannot be altered. And as the County Court, and Hundred Court are of one Jurisdiction; so the Tourn, and Leet be also of one and the same Jurisdiction: For <HI>Derivativa potestas est ejusdem jurisdictionis cum Primitiva.</HI></P>
<P>But both of the Tourn and the Leet this may be truly said,</P>
<Q>Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis.</Q>
<Q><HI>Quodque vera institutio istius Curiae eva∣nuit, &amp; velut umbra ejusdem adhuc re∣manet: Habemus quidem Senatus consultum, sed in Tabulis repositum, &amp; tanquam Gladium in Vagina reconditum,</HI><BIBL> Coke's 2 Inst. cap. 35.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Of <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry,</HI> One being an Ex∣pression of the other, for <HI>Huer</HI> in French (<HI>unde Hutesium</HI>) is to Hoot or Shout, in English to Cry: There be two kinds,
<PB N="609" REF="311"/>one by Common Law, or for the King, as when any Felony is Committed, or any Person Dangerously Wounded or Assaulted, and offered to be robbed either in Day or Night; The Party grieved, or any other may resort to the Constable of the Town, and ac∣quaint him with the Causes describing the Party, and telling him which way the Offendor is gone, and require him to raise <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry;</HI> And the Duty of the Constable is to raise the Power of the Town, as well in the Night as in the Day, for the Prosecution of the Offendor; and if he be not found there, to give the next Constable warning, and he the next until the Offendor be found, and this was the Law before the Conquest.</P>
<P>The Life of <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> is fresh Suit.</P>
<P><HI>Thamar,</HI> The Daughter of King <HI>Da∣vid</HI> being violenty Ravished by her Brother <HI>Amon,</HI> The Text saith of her, <HI>Quae aspergens cinerem capiti suo, Scissa talari tunica, impositisque manibus super caput suum, ibat ingrediens, &amp; clamans.</HI> 2 <HI>Regum, cap.</HI> 13. <HI>Vers.</HI> 19.</P>
<P><HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> by force of Acts of Parliament is in divers Cases; As if a Watchman doth Arrest a Night-walker, and he disobey and fly, the Watchman
<PB N="610" REF="312"/>may make <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry.</HI> 2. <HI>Si quis. Forestarius, Parcarius, aut Warrenarius in balliva sua Malefactores aliquos invenerit vagrantes ad damnum ibidem facien∣dum, &amp;c.</HI> 3. If Welshmen Outlawed or Indicted of Treason or Felony, fly into <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> they shall be appre∣hended, &amp;c. or else pursued by <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry,</HI> and Forfeiture upon those that do not pursue. 4. <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> shall be levied upon takers of Carriage within the Verge of the Staple, of that which pertaineth to the Staple. 5. Where a Man is Robbed; Upon <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry,</HI> &amp;c. What remedy he shall have against the Hundred, &amp;c. And how, and in what manner the <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> shall be made in that Case, See the Statutes and <HI>Coke</HI>'s 7 <HI>Rep. fol.</HI> 6 &amp; 7. And this Robbery must be done in the Day time, and not in the Night; otherwise, the Party grieved shall not have his Action: So <HI>note,</HI> a diversity between a <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> at Common Law, or for the King; And a <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> by Statute, where the Party grieved is to have his remedy by private Action. <HI>Note,</HI> Also a Diversi∣ty in the Prosecution at the Common Law, or for the King, and by the Sta∣tutes which give the Party remedy; for a Prosecution to the next Consta∣ble
<PB N="611" REF="312"/>is good by the Common Law; but so it is not by the said Statutes, which give the Party grieved his Action, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 7 <HI>Report, fo.</HI> 7 &amp; 8. <HI>Milbourn</HI>'s Case.</P>
<P>So the Prosecution at the Common Law, is a good excuse upon an Indict∣ment at the King's Suit; But note, That it is no Bar to the Parties Action.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> either by the Common Law, or by force of any Statute, is Levied upon any Person, the Arrest of such Person is lawful, altho' the Cause of the <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> be feign'd, and if the Cause be feign'd, he that Le∣vied the same shall also be Arrested, and shall be Fined and Imprisoned. But common Fame and Voice is not suf∣ficient to Arrest a Man in Case of Felony, unless a Felony be done in∣deed.</P>

<P><HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> hath been used in some Cases by the Ancient Laws of this Realm: For the Author of the <HI>Mirror</HI> Writing of the Ancient Laws before the Conquest, under the Title <HI>Des Articles des viels Roys ordeins,</HI> saith, <HI>Ordeine fuit que chescun del Age de</HI> xiv. <HI>ans, &amp; oustre de mortels pecheors ensuivre de Ville, &amp; Ville a Hue &amp; Cry.</HI></P>
<P>Et inter Leges Regis <HI>Canuti; Si quit Latroni obviam dederit, eumque nullo edito clamore abire permiserit, quanticùnque fuerit Latronis vita aestimata, extremum solvat denariolum, aut pleno &amp; perfecto jurejurando de facinore nihil habuisse cog∣niti confirmato.

<P>And in legal understanding <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> is all one. In Ancient Records they are called <HI>Hutesium &amp; Clamor,</HI> and may be by Horn, and by Voice, <HI>Avec Hue &amp; Cry de Corne &amp; de Bouche.</HI> And by <HI>Stat.

<PB N="613" REF="313"/>he that goeth not at the Commandment of the Sheriff or Constable at the <HI>Cry</HI> of the <HI>Countrey,</HI> shall be grievously fined and imprisoned.</P>
<P>And divers Acts of Parliament have been since made concerning▪ <HI>Hue</HI> and <HI>Cry,</HI> as the <HI>Stat.

<P>In ancient time the King's Courts, and especially the Leets, had power to inquire of, and punish Fornication and Adultery, by the Name of <HI>Letherwite,</HI> and it appeareth often in the Book of <HI>Doomsday,</HI> That the King had the Fines assessed for those Offences, which were assessed in the King's Courts, and could not be inflicted <HI>in Curia Christianita∣tis.</HI></P>

<P>In the <HI>Romans</HI> time, and before, he was a Minister to the King's Courts of Law and Justice, and had then a Court of his own, which was the <HI>County Court,</HI> then called <HI>Curia Consulatus,</HI> as ap∣pears by these Words, <HI>Ipsius vices sup∣plebat in Jure &amp; in Foro.</HI></P>

<P><HI>En Countie Courts</HI> is there put for an Example, for the Hundred Court and the Court Baron being no Courts of Record, are also within this Law.</P>
<P>Writs of Trespass are there put also for an Example, for <HI>Debt, Detinue, Cove∣nant,</HI> and the like. But if the Trespass be <HI>Vi &amp; Armis,</HI> where the King upon the Conviction of the Defendant, shall have a Fine, there the Sheriff in his County cannot hold Plea of it; for no Court can assess a Fine, but a Court of Record, because a <HI>Capias</HI> to take the Body is incident to it: For it
<PB N="622" REF="318"/>is a Rule in Law, <HI>Quod placita de trans∣gressione contra pacem Regis in Regno An∣gliae vi &amp; armis factis secundum legem &amp; consuetudinem Angliae, sine Brevi Regis placitari non debent.</HI></P>
<P>Neither shall he hold Plea of Tres∣pass for taking away of Charters con∣cerning Inheritance or Freehold; for it is a Maxim in Law, <HI>Quod Placita con∣cernent' Chart', seu script' liberum tene∣mentum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tangentia in aliquibus Curiis quae recordum non habent secundum legem &amp; consuetudinem Regni Angliae sine Brevi Re∣gis placitari non debent.</HI></P>
<P>And as inferiour Courts which are not of Record regularly cannot hold Plea of Debt, &amp;c. or Damages but under 40 <HI>s.</HI> so the Superiour Courts that are of or Damages regularly, unless the Sum amount to 40 <HI>s.</HI> or above. <HI>Ne dignitas Curiarum illarum vilesceret, &amp; ne mate∣riam superaret opus.</HI></P>
<P>Now as the Superiour Courts ought not to incroach upon the Inferiour, so the Inferiour Courts ought not to de∣fraud the Superiour Courts of those Causes that belong to them. For Ex∣ample, If in the <HI>County Court,</HI> or other Inferiour Courts they shall divide a Debt of 20 <HI>l.</HI> into several Pleints under 40 <HI>s.</HI> in this case the Defendant may
<PB N="623" REF="318"/>plead the same to the Jurisdiction of the Court, or may have a prohibition to stay that indirect Suit; for as an ancient Record saith, <HI>Contra jus com∣mune est, petere integrum Debitum exce∣dens summam</HI> 40 s. <HI>per diversas querelas, per parcellas, scilicet</HI> 39 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d. ob. q.</HI></P>
<P>The Maxim of the Common Law is, <HI>Quod placita de catallis, debitis,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>quae summam</HI> 40 <HI>s. attingunt, vel eam exce∣dunt, secundum legem &amp; consuctudinem Angliae sine Brevi Regis placitari nondebent:</HI></P>
<P>And these Words, <HI>sine Brevi Regis,</HI> are material Words; for by the King's Writ, the Sheriff in the Country Court may hold Plea of Goods, debt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> above the Value of 40 <HI>s.</HI> and by force of the King's Writ of <HI>Justicies,</HI> he may hold Plea of an Obligation of what Sum soever; For Example, of 1000 Marks, the which Writ is in the na∣ture of a Commission to the Sheriff to hold Plea of Debt above 40 <HI>s.</HI> The words of which Writ are, <HI>Rex Vicecom', salutem: Praecipimus tibi quod Justicies, A. quod juste &amp; sine dilatione reddat B. mille Marcas, quas ei debet, ut dicit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ne amplius inde clamorem audiamus pro defectu Justiciae.</HI> By force of which Writ he may hold Plea of the same, and the Process therein is Attachment by his Goods, &amp;c. but no <HI>Capias,</HI> and
<PB N="624" REF="319"/>altho' the Power of the Court by this Writ is in this particular inlarged, and the Words of the Writ to the She∣riff are <HI>quod Justicies, &amp;c.</HI> Yet is not the Jurisdiction of the Court as con∣cerning the Judicature thereof altered, for those Words of the Writ do not, nor can make the Sheriff Judge of that Court, in that particular Case, for that were to alter the Juristiction and Judicature of the Court, whereof by the Common Law the Suitors be Judges, which cannot be altered but by Act of Parliament: The Plaintiff may remove this Plea without Cause shewed, but the Defendant cannot without shewing of Cause.</P>
<P>Also by force of a <HI>Justicies</HI> to the Sheriff, he may hold Plea of a Tres∣pass <HI>Vi &amp; Armis.</HI> See the Register and <HI>F. N. B.</HI> divers forms of Writs of <HI>Justicies</HI> in many Actions.</P>
<P>The Sheriff may also hold Plea in a Replevin of Goods and Chattels, above the value of 40 <HI>s.</HI> For if it be by Writ the Words of the Writ be <HI>Rex Vice∣com'</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Praecipimus tibi quod juste, &amp; sine dilatione replegiari facias B. averi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sua,</HI> Or <HI>Bona &amp; Catalla sua, quae</HI> D. <HI>cepit &amp; injuste detinet, ut dicit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ne am∣plius inde clamorem audiamus pro defect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Justiciae.</HI> By force of which Writ
<PB N="625" REF="319"/>which is in nature of a Commission, the Sheriff may deliver the Beasts, or Goods and Chattels of what Value so∣ever. And if the Replevin be by Plaint in the County Court, the Sheriff by the Statute of <HI>Marlebridge,</HI> may hold Plea of what Value soever.</P>
<P>The like Writs in the nature of a Commission directed to Sheriffs, are the Admeasurement of Pasture, Recaption, <HI>Nativo habendo,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>The said Words <HI>Vailent</HI> 40 s. <HI>al meins,</HI> have received this Construction, that the same must so appear to be of Value in the Plaintiffs Count; for it is not suf∣ficient that it appears by Verdict the Sum is under 40 <HI>s.</HI> For Example, if the Plaintiff count in Trespass, Debt, De∣tinue, Covenant, &amp;c. to the damage of 40 <HI>s.</HI> and the Jury find the Damages under 40 <HI>s.</HI> yet the Plaintiff shall have no Judgment, albeit in truth the Case <HI>de jure</HI> belong'd to the Inferior Courts.</P>
<P>And it appeareth by this Act, that the County Court hath no Jurisdiction to hold Plea <HI>de Plagis &amp; Maihemiis,</HI> of Wounds and Maihems; but those Pleas must be determined in the King's Higher Courts; but of Battery (with∣out wounding or maihming) this Act proveth that the Country Court hath Jurisdiction.</P>

<P>In all Writs directed to Sheriffs con∣cerning the County Court, the King saith, <HI>In Comitatu suo;</HI> and in all Re∣turns of Exigents made by him, he saith, <HI>Ad Comitatum meum tentum,</HI> &amp;c. and the Stile of the Court proveth the same also. And by <HI>Stat.</HI> 33. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 13. it is provided, That the Sheriff of <HI>Denbigh</HI> shall keep his Shire-Court at the Shire-Hall in the said County, &amp;c. by which (as by many other Parliaments it appeareth) That the County or Shire Court, is the Court of the She∣riff, altho' the Suitors be there Judges in some Cases.</P>
<P>And as the Custody of the Entries and Rolls thereof do belong to the Of∣fice of the Sheriff, he shall answer for them as immediate Officer to the Court. And therefore the Sheriff shall appoint Clerks under him in his County Court, for whom he shall answer at his Peril. The same Law is of the Sheriffs Tourne,
<PB N="627" REF="320"/><HI>Coke's</HI> 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 191. <HI>Mitton</HI>'s Case.</P>
<P>Resolved, That if the Plea be holden by Writ or without Writ, the Suitors are Judges. The Reason why the Writ is directed to the Lord or Sheriff, is because the Court Baron is the Lord's Court, and the County Court is the Sheriff's Court. And in case they hold Plea by force of the King's Writ, it doth not change the Nature and Juris∣diction of the Court. For as these without Writs are not Courts of Re∣cord, so when the Plea is holden by Writ, the Courts are of the same Nature. For upon a Judgment given in both Cases, a VVrit of false Judgment lieth, and not a Writ of Error. But it is true the King may create a new Court, and appoint new Judges in it; but after the Court is established and created, the Judges of the Court ought to determine Matters in the Court. And therefore neither the Lords of Ancient Demesne, nor the Court Baron, nor the Sheriff in the County Court, when the Plea is holden by Writ of Right, <HI>Justicies,</HI> Ad∣measurement, &amp;c. are Judges; but the Suitors, who by the Common Law are the Judges of the Court. But in some Cases the Sheriff is made Judge by Par∣liament, as in the Redisseisin by the <HI>Stat.</HI>
<PB N="628" REF="321"/>of <HI>Merton, cap.</HI> 3. And all his proceeding by force of that Act, is of Record; and a Writ of Error doth lie of a Judg∣ment given against him, <HI>Coke's</HI> 6 <HI>Rep.</HI> 11, 12. <HI>Jentleman's</HI> Case.</P>
<P>In some Actions the Defendant shall be fined in one Court, and but amer∣ced in another, and yet the Offence shall be all one, as in a Writ of Re∣caption, if it be brought in the Com∣mon Pleas, and Judgment be there given, the Defendant shall be fined and imprisoned. But if the Writ be brought in the County Court, and the Defen∣dant be convict before the Sheriff in the County, the Judgment shall not be, <HI>Quod capiatur, quia nulla Curia, quae Re∣cordum non habet, potest imponere finem, neque aliquem mandare carceri, quia ista spectant tantummodo ad Curias de Recordo;</HI> and therefore in such cases he shall be only amerced, <HI>Coke's</HI> 8 <HI>Rep.</HI> 60. <HI>Beecher's</HI> Case.</P>

<P>If the Escheator taketh an Office <HI>vir∣tute Officii,</HI> he may seise the Land; but if of his own Head he seise the Land without Office, that Seisure is <HI>colore Officii,</HI> and an Assise is maintain∣able against him; <HI>&amp; sic de caeteris, Coke's</HI> 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 206, 207.</P>
<P>Upon the Assise the Party shall re∣cover the Land and double Damages, and the Escheator shall be in the grie∣vous Mercy of the King, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>A Termer could not traverse an Of∣fice by the Common Law; but if it were found in the Office, he might have a <HI>Monstrans de droit;</HI> and so of o∣thers that had but Chattels Real.</P>
<P>Where there is double matter of Re∣cord to intitle the King to a Chattel Personal, as an Attainder, and an Office that the Person attainted was possessed of a House, the Office may be Tra∣versed,

<P>By <HI>Stat. Lincoln de Escheatoribus,</HI> the Escheator cannot seise before Office, <HI>ibidem.</HI></P>
<P>Houses and Lands which lie in Live∣ry, and whereof there is Profit present∣ly taken, the Party by finding the Of∣fice, is out of Possession. But of Rents, Commons, Advowsons, and other In∣heritances incorporeal, which lie in Grant, it is otherwise, <HI>Coke</HI>'s 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 694.</P>
<P>Upon Attainder of Felony the King cannot be Entitled without Office; but if a special Office were found that the Husband had nothing but in Right of his Wife, there the Heir was not put to his Petition, <HI>Coke's</HI> 1 <HI>Rep.</HI> 50. <HI>Alton Wood</HI>'s Case.</P>

<HEAD>To the Court of Admiralty.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a Felony punishable by the Civil Law, because it is done upon the High Sea, as Pyracy, Robbery or Murder, whereof the Com∣mon Law did take no notice, because it could not be tryed by twelve Men. If this Piracy be tryed before the Lord Admiral in the Court of Admiralty ac∣cording to the Civil Law, and the Di∣linquent there attainted, yet shall it work no Corruption of Blood, nor For∣feiture of his Lands; otherwise it is if he be Attainted before Commissioners by force of the <HI>Stat.</HI> 28 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. And Pi∣rate cometh from the <HI>Greek,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifieth a Rover at Sea. <HI>Vide Coke</HI>'s 1 <HI>Inst.</HI> 391. a.</P>
<P>If any Injury, Robbery, Felony, or other Offence be done upon the high Sea, <HI>Lex terrae</HI> extendeth not to it, therefore the Admiral hath Conusance thereof; and may proceed according to the Marine Law by Imprisonment of the Body, and other Proceedings as have been allowed by the Laws of the Realm, <HI>Coke's</HI> 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 51.</P>
<PB N="639" REF="326"/>
<P>The like of things done in a Foreign Kingdom, which shall be tryed before the Constable and Marshal, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wreck,</HI> are such Goods only which are cast and left upon the Land by the Sea. <HI>Flotsam</HI> is when a Ship is sunk, or otherwise perished, and the Goods float upon the Sea. <HI>Jetsam</HI> is when a Ship is in danger to sink, and for lightning the Ship the Goods are cast into the Sea, and afterwards, not∣withstanding the Ship perisheth. <HI>La∣gan,</HI> or rather <HI>Ligan,</HI> is when the Goods so cast into the Sea, and afterwards the Ship perisheth, and such Goods so cast, are so heavy that they sink to the bot∣tom, and the Mariners, to the intent to have them again, tie to them a Buoy or Cork, or such thing which will not sink. And none of these are called <HI>Wrecks,</HI> unless by the Sea put upon Land. And so <HI>Flotsam, Jetsam</HI> and <HI>Lagan</HI> being cast upon the Land, shall pass by the Grant of Wreck, <HI>Coke, Part</HI> 5.106. <HI>Vid. Termes del Ley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wreck</HI> of Sea therefore is when the Goods are by the Sea cast upon the Land, and so <HI>infra Comitatum,</HI> whereof the Common Law taketh Conusance; but the other three are all upon the Sea, and therefore of them the Admi∣ral hath Jurisdiction, <HI>Bracton lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 3.</P>
<PB N="640" REF="327"/>
<P>When <HI>Wreck</HI> is claimed by Prescri∣ption (as by Law it may be) the Plead∣ing is <HI>Bona Wreccata super mare &amp; ad ter∣ram project'.</HI></P>
<P>The Soil upon which the Sea flow∣eth and ebbeth, <HI>scil.</HI> between the high Water and low-Water-Mark, may be Parcel of the Manor belonging to a Subject; and yet resolved in <HI>Lacy</HI>'s Case, <HI>Trin.</HI> 25 <HI>Eliz.</HI> That when the Sea floweth, and hath <HI>plenitudinem maris,</HI> the Admiral shall have Jurisdiction of every thing done upon the Sea be∣tween the High-Water-Mark and Low-Water-Mark, by the ordinary Course of the Sea, as of Felony, &amp;c. Yet when the Sea doth ebb, the Land may be∣long to a Subject.</P>
<P>The King shall have <HI>Flotsam, Jet∣sam</HI> and <HI>Lagan,</HI> when the Ship perish∣eth, or the Owners of the Goods are unknown.</P>
<P>A Man may have <HI>Flotsam</HI> and <HI>Jet∣sam</HI> by the King's Grant, and <HI>Flotsam</HI> by Prescription, as before is said.</P>
<P>Resolved that the <HI>Stat.</HI> of <HI>Westminst.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. by which it is Enacted, <HI>That of Wreck of the Sea it is agreed, That where a Man, Dog or Cat escape alive out of the Ship or Vessel, not any thing within them shall be accounted Wreck; but the Goods shall be saved and kept by the View of the
<PB N="641" REF="327"/>Sheriff, Coroner, or King's Bailiff,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>So that if any sue for those Goods, and can prove that they belonged to him, or that they perished in his keeping within a year and a day; they shall be restored to him without delay,</HI> &amp;c. was but a Declarati∣on of the Common Law. And there∣fore all that which is provided as to Wreck, extendeth also to <HI>Flotsam, Jet∣sam</HI> and <HI>Lagan.</HI></P>
<P>The Common Law gave all these three, as also Estray, Treasure-Trove, and the like, to the King; for when no Man can claim Property in Goods, the King shall have them by his Prero∣gative: But <HI>Wreck</HI> may belong to the Subject by Grant from the King, or by Prescription.</P>
<P><HI>Flotsam, Jetsam</HI> and <HI>Lagan,</HI> so long as upon the Sea, do not belong to the King, but <HI>occupanti conceduntur, eo quod constare non possit ad quam regionem essent applicanda.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Wreck</HI> as well as Estrays of an Infant, Feme-Covert, Executrix, a Man in Prison, or beyond Sea, if proclaimed, and none claim them within a Year and a Day, are bounden by the Law, <HI>Coke's Rep. lib.</HI> 5.106, 108. Sir <HI>Henry Constable</HI>'s Case.</P>
