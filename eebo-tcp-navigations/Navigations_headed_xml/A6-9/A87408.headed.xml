<HEAD>A true relation of Prince <HI>Robert</HI> his arrivall to England the mischance that befell him comming, what forces and ammu∣nition were brought with him, and his welcome to his Uncle our sacred King.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Rince <HI>Robert</HI> in the midst of his voyage for England, was chas'd by two or three of my Lord of Warwicks ships, which indeed was ignorantly done, in respect it was not known what shipps they were, where the Prince was from whence they came, whither they went, not upon what occasion; But having narrowly scaped, the Prince landed at Do∣ver with a matter of two hundred men or upward, well money'd, the summe (amounting to above 100000 pounds) that hee carried with him with
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> some other martiall ammunition, for the young Prince having intelligence that England was like to be in an uprore, and that the King (his Vncle) did in some way stand in defect of men and mony, brought with him the greatest store hee possible could make shift for, the Ammunition he had was but little, of which most were swords and pistolls, with a few pikes, all did not amount to the number of an hun∣dred and fifty, with sixe peeces of Ordnance and 14 horses, one of which fourteen Prince <HI>Robert</HI> him∣selfe did ride upon, the horse being somewhat wild, and the Prince desirous with all speed to hasten to the Kings Majesty his Vncle, set his horse so to it, that ere he came three miles from Dover he had a most dangerous fall, so that his sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lder the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby was put out of joynt, and his arme extraordinarily sprained, but a Surgeon was quickly sent for, and a bone-setter, who by their vigilant industry soon made whole all those grieved parts, the Prince in such eagernesse to see his uncle, tooke no more re∣spite than three or foure dayes, but that immedi∣ately hee tooke horse againe, and riding towards Yorke, had intelligence by the way, that the Kings Majesty was departed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hence to one Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Lees,</HI> inhabiting within foure miles of Coven∣try, so that the Prince was faine to returne thither, no sooner had our Kings Majesty intelligence of his comming, but that hee went (accompanied with some of the Cavalliers) to meete him, who, when hee met, he courteously embraced in his armes, and thanked him for that kindnesse.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>There is a ship well fraught with Ammunition and money that was intended for Portsmouth, but being shroudly chac'd by some of my Lord of War∣wickes Commanders, was driven to Southamp∣ton, and is there now taken, the money and Am∣munition is by my Lords command brought here to London.</P>
