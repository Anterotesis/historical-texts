<P>The inward circle is diuided into 360 degrees, giuing vnto each Signe 30 de∣grees, the semidiameter of the twelue mo∣neths is supposed to be diuided into 60 parts, from w<SUP>ch</SUP> center is supposed another center to be 2 degrees 9 minutes of the said 60 parts, according to <HI>Ticho Brache,</HI> who maketh the place or point of the Sunnes <HI>Apogeum,</HI> to be in the 6 degree of Cancer, in this age of the world. The <HI>Apogeum</HI> of the Sunne is that point in which when the Sunne commeth vnto he is in his slowest mo∣tion, or furthest distant from the Earth, that is to say, Iune 17. then the Sunne shall be in the sixt degree of Cancer, the <HI>Peregeum</HI> of the Sunne shall be when he commeth into the sixt degree of Capricorne, being opposite to the sixt degree of Cancer. The second mouable part is diuided into 29 dayes and one halfe, which doth shew the age of the Moone.

Example, April 14. the place of the Sun will be found to be in the 4 degree of Taurus.</P>
<P>Secondly, the day of the Change or New Moone being giuen to finde the age of the Moone, the signe and degree she posses∣seth in the Zodiacke, the time of her comming to the South, and tune of full Sea or high water in any Hauen, knowing the time of the Changes or full Moone after this manner:</P>
<P>In some Almanack (or by the Epact) find the day of the change of the Moone going before, the day that ye desire; and so many dayes after the change, so many dayes old is the Moone.</P>
<P>First bring the Index of Sol or the Sunne to the day of the moneth, and there stay it. Secondly, bring the Index of the Moone, to the age of the Moon, and it sheweth the signe and de∣gree that she possesseth in the Zodiacke, the houre and minute vn∣der the age, is the time of her comming to the South.</P>

<P>BLazing Starres or Comets, are flames drawne into the higher part of the Ayre, which come by drinesse and long quiet∣nesse in the Ayre. They signifie corruption in the Ayre to fol∣low. They are either signes of warres and death, or tokens of earth-quakes, and dearth of corne. In the yeare 1618. there hap∣pened

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The manner of the Moones Eclipse.</HEAD>
<P>THe word Eclipse is as much to say as To want light, and to be darkned, or hidden from our sight.</P>
<P>The Moones Eclipse is figured at the foot of <HI>America,</HI> ouer against your left hand, which is thus: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
<P>When the Sun and Moone are opposite one to the other dia∣metrally, and the Earth in the very midst betweene both: that is, when a right line drawne from the center of the Sun to the cen∣ter of the Moone, passeth through the center of the Earth: For the body of the earth being thicke and not transparent, casting his shadow to that point which is opposite to the place of the Sun, will not suffer the Moon to receiue any light from the Sun, from whom she alwayes borroweth her light. And note, that euery time she is at the full, shee is opposite to the Sun, and yet the Earth is not at euery such full diametrally betwixt her and the Sun, for then she should be eclipsed at euery full, which indeed cannot be, vnless she be either in the head or taile of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Now the Moone is eclipsed in part, when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moone, be met in one selfe diametrall line, but the Moon is declining either on the one side or on the other.</P>
<P>But note that eclipses of the Moone may be vniuersall, because the Earth is far bigger then the Moone, and thereby able to sha∣dow her whole body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The manner of the Sunnes Eclipse.</HEAD>
<P>THe Eclipse of the Sun is shewed by that Figure at the foot of <HI>Asia,</HI> against your right hand, and happeneth</P>
<P>When the Moone is betwixt the Sun and the Earth, which chanceth in a Coniunction or new of the Moone: and yet not in euery Coniunction, but when it falleth either in the head or taile of the Dragon: which may chance (as is said before) either totally, or in part: totally, in respect of those parts of the Earth whereon the shadow directly falleth. For sith the Moone is farre lesser then the Earth, she cannot shadow all the Earth, and there∣fore the eclipse of the Sun cannot be vniuersall: but yet to some parts of the earth it may be totally, to some partly, and to others nothing at all; as may appeare by the aforesaid Figure.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Firmament and Constellations.</HEAD>
<P>THe two Hemispheares in the middle aboue, filled with fi∣gures of men, beasts, fishes, and the like, embost with starres, doe represent the fate of the Firmament or Orbe of the fixed stars (those that appeare euery night) which were by ancient A∣stronomers diuided into, and distinguished by certaine Constel∣lations, and each of these is knowne by a proper name. Of these Constellations the number (according to the ancient account) is 48, that are diuided into three parts:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Northerne Constellations, being 21 in number.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Zodiacke Constellations, being 12 in number.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Southerne Constellations, being 15 in number.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Northerne Constellations consist of 332. stars.</P>
<P>The Zodiacke Constellations, which be also called the twelue Signes, consist of 280 stars.</P>
<P>The Southerne Constellations containe 293 starres.</P>
<P>Some of these Constellations consist of more, some of fewer stars, according to their greatnesse or smalnesse.</P>
<P>Besides these there are 120 stars that are exempt out of all the Constellations: so that the number of stars set vpon both Hemi∣spheares are 1025; and diuers of them haue proper names.</P>
<P>But here is to be vnderstood, that all the stars in heauen are not numbred, nor cannnot, for that diuers of them are so small: but these 1025 are the principallest among them, and all that haue yet euer beene accounted of.</P>
<P>The two first parts of all, that is, the Northerne and Zodiacke Constellations are contained in that part right against your left hand, and placed ouer a piece of <HI>America.</HI> The last, that is, the Southerne, is comprehended in that other Hemispheare on your right hand, and ouer the European Sea.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Figure of the heauenly Orbes and Elements.</HEAD>
<P>THe whole world is diuided into two parts, <HI>viz.</HI> Elementall, and Etheriall or coelestiall parts.</P>
<P>The Elementall part is fourefold: <HI>viz. Earth, Water, Ayre, Fire:</HI> as may be seene in that round Figure of the frame of the hea∣uens and elements one within another; the inmost and middle∣most circle containing Earth and Water intermixed together: The next, the three Regions of the Aire: and immediately aboue that Orbe, is the Element of Fire: all which you may easily dis∣cerne by their seuerall names in their proper places.</P>
<P>The Etheriall or Celestiall parts doe compasse the Elementall parts: and containe the ten vpper Spheares: <HI>viz.</HI> 1 the <HI>Moone,</HI> 2 <HI>Mercury,</HI> 3 <HI>Venus,</HI> 4 <HI>Sol,</HI> 5 <HI>Mars,</HI> 6 <HI>Iupiter,</HI> 7 <HI>Saturne,</HI> 8 the <HI>Starry firmament,</HI> 9 the <HI>Christaline heauen,</HI> hauing no stars at all; the 10 is the <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> or first Mouer, containing all the rest within it; and mouing from the East to the West carieth a∣bout with it in violence all the other Spheares.</P>
<P>The rest of the Spheares haue contrary motions, euery one in his kind, though far slower then the other: and their motions are contrary, from the West to the East, and so are caried about oftentimes by the first Mouer before they make one perfect reuo∣lution in themselues.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crystaline</HI> or ninth Spheare his motion is almost vnsen∣sible, and is called <HI>The trembling Motion,</HI> and is performed ac∣cording to the opinion of later Astronomers, in 49000 yeares.</P>
<P>The eight Spheare being the <HI>Starry Firmament,</HI> performeth his motion in 7000 yeares.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>The rest of the Spheares are the seuen Planets; each Spheare containeth in it but one Starre; whereof the vppermost and slow∣est is <HI>Saturne,</HI> which performeth his course in thirty yeares. <HI>Iupi∣ter</HI> being next vnder that, makes his reuolution in twelue yeares. <HI>Mars</HI> beneath him, finisheth his course in two yeares. <HI>Sol</HI> pas∣seth through the Zodiacke in 365 dayes and sixe houres, which is one whole yeare. <HI>Venus</HI> ends her course in somewhat more then a yeare. <HI>Mercury</HI> holds equall pace with the Sunne. <HI>Luna</HI> cour∣seth about the heauen once euery eight and twenty dayes.</P>

<P>THe imaginary parts of the earth are such, which not being at all in the Earth, must yet bee supposed to bee so, for the better teaching and learning this Science; and are certaine Circles going about the Earth, answerable to them in Heauen in name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Meridian</HI> (which comes first to be considered) is a great Circle compassing round the earth from Pole to Pole; and is that which you see in the circumference of both Planispheares of this Map; and wherein are written the names of the Zones and Climates. This chiefe, first, fixed Meridian passeth through the Ilands called Azores, according to the ancient Cosmographers; and there are two reasons why they did there begin to reckon the longitude of the earth:</P>
<P>First, for that at that time there was no land knowne further to the Westward then that place.</P>
<P>Secondly, vnder that Meridian the needle in the Mariners Compasse had no variation, but did point directly North and South.</P>
<P>There are also many Meridians according to the diuerse place in which a man liues, the number of them equall to so many points as may bee imagined in the Globe; but the vsuall setting them downe to view, is by ten degrees asunder; and are those blacke lines which you see in both Planispheares, running down along from the North to the South Pole.</P>
<P>The vse of the Meridian, is to shew the longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City, or Cape, is the di∣stance of it East from the first great Meridian; and this longitude is measured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian, into the East, and contai∣neth the whole compasse of the earth, viz. 360. degrees.</P>
<P>To proue this by example, cast your eye on London, and you shall see it something to the East of the second blacke Meridian; passe downe with that blacke line to the Aequinoctiall, and look as much East there, as London is from that Meridian aboue, then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall from the first great Meri∣dian to that place, and that distance is the longitude of London; which you may perceiue to be 20. degrees and better. And the like manner of working is to be made for all other places.</P>
<P>That <HI>line</HI> full of degrees, crossing both Planispheares straight along in the middle, and diuiding the world into two halfs <HI>(viz.)</HI> North and South halfes, is called the <HI>Aequinoctiall line,</HI> or the Aequator; either because it is of equall distance from both Poles of the world, or else because the Sunne comming in this Circle makes the dayes and nights throughout the world of like length; which happens vpon the 10. or 11. of March, and the 13. or 14. of September. It passes through Abassia or <HI>Prestor Iohns</HI> King∣dome, and Mani Congo in Africa, through the great Iland Su∣matra, and the Maldiue Iles of Asia; and in America, through Guiana.</P>
<P>The vse of it is to shew the Latitude of any Country, Citie, Promontory, or the like: Now the Latitude is the distance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinoctiall line or middle of the world, and is reckoned and measured vpon the Meridian toward either Pole: those therefore haue Northerne latitude that inhabit betweene the Aequinoctiall and the North Pole, as they haue Southerne latitude that are betweene the same Aequator and the South Pole.</P>
<P>Those <HI>blacke lines</HI> thwarting the blacke Meridians from East to West, are parallels, &amp; are also called Aequidistants, being distant one from another 10. degrees toward both Poles; and are here set downe for the easier counting the latitude of any place from the Aequinoctiall: as for the <HI>latitude</HI> of London; count so many decimall parallels till you come to the parallel which is neerest London, (you shall finde them to be fiue) then follow that line to the Meridian, and see the figures set thereat; (they are 50.) moreouer adde to that number of 50. so much as London is situ∣ate aboue that parallel, the space is one degree and a halfe; thus shall you finde the latitude of London, (that is, the distance thereof from the Aequator toward the North Pole) to be 51. de∣grees and a halfe: and in like manner must the Latitude of all other places be sought. Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two the whole Earth is reckoned.</P>
<P>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as also the Zodiacke, are fil∣led throughout with degrees, the number 360. and euery degree consists of 60. Minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20. leagues, or threescore miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>great circle</HI> that is drawne bending bias in the one plani∣spheare vp to the Tropicke of Cancer, in the other downe to the Tropicke of Capricorne, is the <HI>Zodiacke;</HI> it is replenished with degrees, and bears on it the characters of the 12. signes.</P>
<P>The vses of it are to shew ouer what Countries and people the body and beames of the Sunne come perpendicular at some times or other in the yeare: and it shewes to all (where the dayes increase and decrease) the longest and shortest daies of the yeare: for the Sunne (which causeth the same) being alwaies in this circle, and therein mouing, about one degree a day, all the while he is comming vp from the Tropicke of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increase in the Northerne Climats; but con∣trariwise in his course backe from Cancer to Capricorne, they shorten to vs, and lengthen to those in the Southerne Climates: and this Circle shewes the foure quarters of the yeare, Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Cancer,</HI> (so called of the coelestiall signe Can∣cer) is a circle, whose distance from the Aequinoctiall toward the North, is 23. degrees and a halfe. When the Sunne is come so farre Northward as to touch this circle, then is our longest day in the yeare.</P>
<P>It passes through the Southermost parts of Barbary and Ae∣gypt, Arabia, India, China, <HI>Noua Hispania,</HI> and the Iland Cuba.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Capricorne,</HI> (likewise so named of the signe Ca∣pricorne in the starry heauen) is a circle of like distance as the other Tropicke from the Aequinoctiall Southward, that is, 23. degrees and a halfe. When the Sunne is gone downe to this circle Southward, it is our shortest day in the whole yeare.</P>
<P>This Tropicke passes through Monomotapa, Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> Iland, Peru, and the South coasts of Brasile.</P>
<P>The <HI>Articke,</HI> or North polar circle, is distant from the North Pole 23. degrees and a halfe; so much as the Tropicke of Cancer is from the Aequinoctiall: but the distance betweene that Tro∣picke and it, is 43. degrees.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>You may see it passe through Island, Norway, Boddia, Mosco∣uie, Tartary, crosse <HI>Davis</HI> Straits, and Groenland.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antarticke</HI> or South polar circle, is distant from the South pole, 23. degrees and a halfe; so far as the Tropicke of Capri∣corne is from the Aequinoctiall.</P>
<P>This circle passes through Magellanica, or <HI>Terra Australis In∣cognita</HI> onely.</P>
<P>Now these foure lesser circles, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the two Tropickes, and Polar circles, doe fitly part the earth into fiue Zones.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Zones.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a space of earth, contained betweene two of the smaller circles, or within the compasse of either polar circle: the name signifies as much as a girdle, by reason that each Zone compasseth about the earth in manner of a girdle. Of these there be two kinds: one temperate, the other vntemperate.</P>
<P>There bee two temperate Zones, the one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North temperate Zone</HI> is that space of earth contained be∣tweene the Tropicke of Cancer, and the North polar circle.</P>
<P>The <HI>South temperate Zone</HI> is that space of earth stretched along betweene the Tropicke of Capricorne, and the South po∣lar circle.</P>
<P>They are called temperate Zones for that the ayre thereof hath a far better and more moderate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, then the vntemperate Zones. The breadth of them is 43, degrees apiece, which degrees make either temperate Zone to be 2580. English miles broad apiece.</P>
<P>The <HI>vntemperate Zones</HI> are twofold: one exceeding in the extre∣mity of heat, the other as much in cold: they haue beene thought in former times altogether vnhabitable, but later experience hath found them more fit for habitation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Torrid or burnt Zone</HI> (which is the hot vntemperate Zone) is that space of heauen which you see contained betweene the Tropicke of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of <HI>Torrid,</HI> because the Sunne continually passes thereouer, and ca∣sting downe direct rayes, affects it with a maruellous heat, there∣by making it not so conuenient for the inhabitants, as the tempe∣rate Zones are. The breadth of this Zone is comprehended be∣tweene the two Tropickes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>aines 47. degrees, that is of English miles 2820.</P>
<P>The <HI>frozen Zones</HI> are space of earth inclosed within either of the Polar circles: of these th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e are two, one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North frozen Zone</HI> is that space of earth contained within the compasse of the North polar circle. The breadth thereof is reckoned 23. degrees and a halfe, <HI>(viz.)</HI> from the Pole it selfe to the polar circle: which of English miles is 1410.</P>
<P>The <HI>South frozen Zone,</HI> is that space of earth compassed all about with the South polar circle: It hath the like breadth from the South pole, as the other frozen Zone hath from the North pole; and likewise the number of miles is the same.</P>
<P>They are called <HI>Frozen Zones,</HI> because they (for the most part) exceed in cold: and that is caused in regard that the Sunne, for a good part of the yeare, is vnder the Horizon, and sees them not: and when he is come vp into their sight, his appearance (which is for a pretty long season together) rather comforts them, then any virtuall heart proceeding from him; for there the Ayre is stuft with thicke foggy vapours, and his beames at highest fall but very oblikely on them: so that what through his want and vnability to dispell the cold, and the colds force to resist and beat backe the Sunnes heat, these Zones remaine almost vnhabitable, and euen (as the word is) frozen.</P>
<P>The names of all these, set in the right place of each Zone, you shall see in that Meridian going about America and Magellanica.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Climats.</HEAD>
<P>IN that <HI>great Meridian</HI> going about Europe, Asia, and Africa, are described the <HI>Climates:</HI> Now a <HI>Climat</HI> is a space of the Earth included within the space of two Parallels. The vse of them is to shew the difference of length and shortnesse of dayes ouer all the world, as you may see in the midst of euery Climat set the number of the houres of the longest day in the yeare, vn∣der that Climat: the longest day in one Climat differing halfe an houre from the longest in another. So that there are foure and twenty Climes, consisting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be 24. houres in length, which is twelue houres longer then the ordinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be vnder∣stood; Vnder the Aequinoctiall line, and 13. degrees, that is 3. Parallels, on either side thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of twelue houres, but after in euery Clime increase the length of halfe an houre, so that there are numbred (as is said before) 48. Parallels, which make 24. Climats, before the dayes become 24. houres long: the which length they being growne to, their in∣crease is then by whole weekes and moneths, till in the foure and twentieth Clime, about the Pole, the day is full halfe a yeare long. And as it is thus betweene the Aequator and North Pole, so is it betweene the said Aequator and the South Pole: wherefore there are two sorts of Climats, that is, 24. Northerne, and as many Southerne. The Climes Northward are thus named: the first is <HI>Dia Meroes,</HI> because the middle parallell thereof passes through the middest of the Inland Iland Meroe, in the Conti∣nent of Africa; the second is <HI>Dia Sienes,</HI> the third <HI>Dia Alexan∣drias,</HI> the fourth <HI>Dia Rhodos,</HI> the fift <HI>Dia Romes,</HI> the sixt <HI>Dia Ponton,</HI> the seuenth <HI>Dia Boristhenes,</HI> the eight <HI>Dia Ripheos,</HI> the ninth <HI>Per Daniam.</HI> The South Climes haue the same names, saue onely that the word <HI>Antuis</HI> thereto added; as <HI>Anti-Dia Me∣roes;</HI> the next, <HI>Anti-Dia Sienes,</HI> and so along vnto the ninth Southward: further then the ninth Clime on either side the Ae∣quinoctiall they are not named; but yet the Climes runne on both wayes to the number of 24. as is seene in the Meridian. That there be but nine named, the reason is, because when these names were giuen, no more then nine Climats were knowne to those of ancient times; but since, though the number of them be increast to 24. the rest are not so knowne by proper names, but remaine innominate.</P>
