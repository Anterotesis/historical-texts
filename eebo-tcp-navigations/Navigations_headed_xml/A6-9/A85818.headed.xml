<HEAD>A true DESCRIPTION OF CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CArolina</HI> is part of the Main in <HI>America,</HI> and so much celebrated by Monsieur <HI>Laudonere,</HI> that he entitles it <HI>Florida,</HI> because of her florid, and fragrant Fields, imbellish'd with Flowers, that perfume the Air: whose sweet Scitu∣ations, by reason of most delicious and pleasant Meadows (and flourishing Savana's) adorn the Continent; and whose benevolent Breast sends daily Supplies to the Planter, and hourly Relief to the poor and necessitous Native: whose spacious Arms (as if circulating the Ocean) proclaims her Shores San∣ctuary to distressed Mariners; and a generous protection to deplorable Seamen, that sollicit refreshment from her replenish'd Harbours, which extend themselves southward to the River St. <HI>Mattheo,</HI> so dilates to <HI>Luck Island,</HI> near <HI>Roanoack</HI> on the promontories of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in thirty six degrees North Latitude (now called <HI>Albemarle</HI>) a large and spacious settlement consisting of some two or three thousand Inhabitants, upon a fertil Soil.</P>
<P>But the late and flourishing settlement lies yet more Southerly, in and about 32 Degrees, odd Minutes; parallel with <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in <HI>Palestine:</HI> and equals the heighth of <HI>Bermudos,</HI> upon the navigable Rivers of <HI>Cooper,</HI> and <HI>Ashly;</HI> formerly known by the Names of <HI>Wando</HI> and <HI>Kiawah.</HI></P>
<P>This is that famous <HI>Carolina,</HI> which his Majesty the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has united to his Imperial Crown, and by his Royal Grant established it a Province; and has dignified it a Principality: which by consent amongst the Lords is transferr'd to the eldest Proprietor. But the Proprietors are eight in number, and their Names and Titles as followeth. Lord Chancellor <HI>Clarendon,</HI> Lord Duke <HI>Albemarle,</HI> Earl of <HI>Craven,</HI> Lord <HI>Anthony Ashly Cooper</HI> Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury, John</HI> Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> Sir <HI>William Berkley,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colleton</HI> Kt. and Bar. These are the Lords Proprietors, whose Laws and Government (because to pro∣ceed in my Description) is suspended till farther Opportunity presents to usher them in.</P>
<P>The Heavens shine upon this famous Country the soveraign Ray of health; and has blest it with a serene Air, and a lofty Skie, that defends it from noxious Infection; nor is there any known Distemper incident to the Inhabitant whereby to terrify and affright him; who for the most part lives by the Law of Plenty, extended to the utmost limits of Sanity.</P>
<P>Several Families have transported themselves from the Ports of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but what from the rest of the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> I know not: yet am credibly inform'd (and from very good hands) that divers are gone, and going from thence: as also from <HI>New-Providence, Bermudus, New-York, New-Jersey, New-England, Long-Island De-la-ware, Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia;</HI> but great num∣bers
<PB REF="2"/>from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and several from the borders of <HI>Ireland:</HI> besides divers good Ships, with some eminent Families that are lately gone off from the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> Moreover, its a salubrious Air to the sick, and diseased; and a generous retirement to necessitous, and ab∣ject Families; as also the assurance of such as study to be rich: Engins strong enough one would think to induce Mankind to hope the prosperity of this famous Settlement.</P>
<P>But the settlement of <HI>Albemarle</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Roanoak</HI>) presents first to our view; and is the oldest, and remotest Northern County in the fair Province of <HI>Carolina;</HI> scituated about 35 Degrees, and odd Minutes North Latitude: from whose replenished Meadows (as also from the more Southern Inhabitants) as good Beef, and Pork is saved, and sent off to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and other the <HI>Charibbee</HI> Islands, as Art and Industry can husband.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Ashley</HI> County is yet more southward, and lies scituated 32 degrees, 45 minutes; where the Setlers and Inhabitants toil not in Summer to accommodate themselves with Win∣ter's Provision: because hitherto they have considered it useless, and altogether unnecessary for the Planter to employ his Hands, and Strength, where Nature so liberally stocks them with Herbage: and the Winter, because so softned with a moderate Air, represents it much of the cast and temperament with our <HI>March</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and that's as much as to consider it the relique only of a mild and short Winter, or rather the surprizal of an approaching Spring, that breaths forth to iniciate the Summer. And here it is that their Ships are built, and drest up by <HI>Bermudian</HI> hands, the most approved Mariners; and a general Errour if not the best navigating Ships in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>And now by way of Advice, the first thing requisit and necessary for the Setler to embrace, is to fell Timber, and to clear the Ground (which is reasonably undertaken, as by an <HI>Ad∣vertisement</HI> in the last Paragraph) as some already have done, and planted <HI>Potatoes,</HI> the <HI>Cas∣saida Root, Yams, Eddies, Carrots, Cabbidges, Onyons, Turnips, Parsnips, Shelots,</HI> (but they grow naturally there) <HI>Collyflowers, Artichokes, Musk-Melons,</HI> and <HI>Water-Melons;</HI> besides <HI>Wormwood, Nep, Scurvy-grass, Rue, Meadsweet, Trefoil, Cinquefoil, Elecampane, (Annis, Cububs,</HI> and <HI>Car∣damome Seeds) Radishes,</HI> and <HI>Horse-Radishes, Mellelot, Angellica, Arch-Angel, Rosemary, Thime, Lettice, Spinage, Sweetmarjarum,</HI> Summer, and Winter-<HI>Savory, Endive, Succory, Hopps, Water-Cresses, Cena,</HI> and <HI>China-Root,</HI> with other <HI>Druggs,</HI> and <HI>Saxafrage, Sassafras,</HI> and <HI>Sassaperrilla:</HI> besides divers other Vegitables without number.</P>
<P>Moreover, all sorts of <HI>English</HI> Grane, as <HI>Wheat, Rye, Barley, Peas, Beans, Oates, Lentills, Fitches,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, with other <HI>European</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Roots, and Plants; which <HI>Carolina</HI> beyond dispute with small industry will produce as large, and as good as the World has.</P>
<P>The next thing worthy our consideration, is their plentiful Eating; because having their accommodation very cheap within themselves; where Beef two years since was sold at 12 <HI>s.</HI> a 100, and Pork at the rate of 16 <HI>s.</HI> So that Cattel (you may read) begins to be plentiful, and Hoggs of a prodigious encrease. And most of those Cattel very fair, and large-headed Beasts, now grazing up and down in beautiful <HI>Savana</HI>'s, little or nothing inferiour to our <HI>English</HI> Meadows: there are several industrious Setlers, and Planters, that prosper very well, tho not having much to begin with.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are Barrows (which by reason of the superabundant plenty of Mast, and Roots in those parts) that some have weighed three or four hundred weight a-piece, and such had the Lady <HI>Yeomans,</HI> as I am credibly informed, who had 400 Hoggs in a Herd, and 500 Turkies in a Drove; besides Dunghil Fowls too numerous to relate without suspition. And which Plantation of hers, consisting of 1500 Acres, was by the industry of one Mr. <HI>James Moore</HI> (an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman) cleared from Charge in some three years time, and with the
<PB REF="3"/>natural produce of the Country only; which amplifies the great fertility of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦gether with the encrease of Beef, and Pork, which if well saved, and sent off to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (as some has already been sent to <HI>Barbadoes</HI>) must of necessity bring in consider<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>Upon Honey some have strong Inclinations, when because having such variety (and Blossoms) that invites to accommodate the Laborious Bee; where, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they become so prolifick, as frequently to swarm four times in a year; and such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦crease from one single Hive, brought over from <HI>Bermudus (tho half of them wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> that within less than two full years, Captain <HI>Morris Matthews (an industrious Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manages Lieutenant Colonel</HI> James Colleton's <HI>Plantation</HI>) had a produce of more th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> besides a <HI>Presentation</HI> made to the <HI>Governour</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian Natives</HI> get a sweet Oil out of the <HI>Hickery Nutt,</HI> which is much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our <HI>English Walnut,</HI> but not so racy, nor the Kernel so plump and pleasant; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they sell for Beads and Trifles of little or no value: which Oil may be much mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and substituted in lieu of <HI>Oil Olives.</HI> So that the staple Commodities of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> Wine, Oil, Silk, Hides, Wool, Tallow, Honey, Bees-Wex, Tobacco, Hemp, Flax, Linn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cloth, Pitch, Tar, Cordage,</HI> and <HI>Masts for Shipping.</HI></P>

And where all other Roots and Fruit-Trees thrive to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Orange Trees, Limon Trees,</HI> and <HI>China Orange Trees, Quince Trees, Cherry Trees <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Pear Trees,</HI> and <HI>Prickle Pears,</HI> that bear twice a year.

<P>This I should think (with other Advantages) were enough to compensate the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Industry of the Setlers, besides the natural propensity of Love the Natives h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Souls liv'd only in the Bosom of the <HI>English</HI> by natural Instinct, because when to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves and services to fish, and hunt their Game for a Trifle; to fell Tim¦<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Corn, and to gather in their Crop: as also to Pilot, and convey them from o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to another.
