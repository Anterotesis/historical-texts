<STAGE>THE preparation of the opening of the Scene is by a Prelude and Co∣rante. Afterwards the Curtain rises by de∣grees to an Ascending Ayre, and a Har∣bour is discern'd, (which was first disco∣ver'd by Sr. <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and called by him <HI>Port-pheasant</HI>) where two Ships are Moor'd, and Sea-Carpenters are erecting a Pinnace, whilst others are selling Trees to build a Fort. The narrowness to the entrance of the Harbour may be observ'd, with Rocks on either side; and out at Sea a Ship towing a Prize. And likewise on the top of a high Tree, a Marriner ma∣king his Ken. This Prospect is made through a Wood, differing from those of European Climats, by representing of <HI>Coco</HI>-Trees, <HI>Pines,</HI> and <HI>Palmitos.</HI> And on

<L>Be higher lifted, or be farther led.</L>
<L>All I would speak, should tell you, I despise</L>
<L>That treasure which I now would make your Prize:</L>
<L>Unworthy 'tis to be your chiefest aime.</L>
