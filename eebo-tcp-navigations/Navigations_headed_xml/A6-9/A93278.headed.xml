<L>Let's mix our Prayers with Thanks-givings, and</L>

<L>Then let us Heaven's help implore, and then</L>

<L>Fire your Ships; yes, and your Houses too.)</L>
<L>Alas! (but like the <HI>Babel</HI>-builders) ye</L>
<L>In your <HI>Luciferous</HI> projectings be.</L>
<L>Confusion must needs attend such hopes,</L>
<L>Whose bold aspirings have no narrower scopes.</L>
<L>Then (ye have need enough of, it I'm sure)</L>
<L>Take yet a Soveraign, and easie cure.</L>

<L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suetonius in in vitâ, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Augustus Caesar's</HI> Ingenuity</L>
<L>Was much; nor yet was less his Clemency:</L>
<L>When he by Proclamation did decree,</L>
<L>A large <HI>reward</HI> to any that shou'd be</L>
<L>The happy Victor, to bring him the head</L>
<L>Of a then famous Pyrate: (As 'twas s'ed;)</L>
<L>The Pyrate hearing this, as boldly came,</L>
<L>As wisely, and laid at his feet the same.</L>
<L><HI>Caesar</HI> then pardoned his past offence,</L>
<L>And then rewarded too his confidence</L>
<L>That he had in his mercy; This may be</L>
<L><HI>(Hogens)</HI> Exemplary, If wisely ye</L>
<L>Will but submit unto his <HI>Royal</HI> will,</L>
<L><HI>Carolus Caesar</HI> will have mercy still.</L>
<L>(I might have said, <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> He</L>
<L>I hope ye know's <HI>August</HI> enough for ye.)</L>
<L>Do not contend, (Ye must at last submit,</L>
<L>In spight of all the <HI>wit</HI> of proud <HI>De Wit.</HI>)</L>
<L>But cast your selvs (it is the wisest thing)</L>
<L>Upon the <HI>Royal Honor</HI> of a King.</L>
<L>A King, that (if ye do it not neglect)</L>
<L>Can gallantly reliev ye and protect.</L>
<L>All your <HI>French-Mountebanks</HI> can do, ye see,</L>
<L>Is nothing else, but e'en to <HI>take the fee:</HI></L>
<L>And gazing at each other, now each Elf</L>
<L>Can only cry, <HI>Physitian heal thy self.</HI></L>
<L>But if ye will avoid approaching Fate</L>
<L>Then do not <HI>Phrygian</HI>-like repent too late;</L>
<L>But save the labour (while time doth invite)</L>
<L>To either <HI>run-away again,</HI> or fight;</L>
<L>Least your <HI>conceited Glory</HI> do expire</L>
<L>In vig'rous and condign Blood and Fire.</L>
<L>But do not like such <HI>Pseudo-Martyrs</HI> burn,</L>
<L>Prefer an <HI>Ʋrim</HI> then before an <HI>Ʋrn.</HI></L>
<L>Do but submit to <HI>Charls,</HI> and <HI>Pennance do.</HI></L>
<L>He'l be your <HI>Ʋrim,</HI> and your <HI>Thummim</HI> too.</L>
