<HEAD>The substance of the DECLARATION OF THE Declared King of Scots. Upon the Death of the MARQUES of MONTROSSE, THE Number of his Guard, and the set∣ting out of a Fleet from HOLLAND, and another from SPAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEre arived a Ship on <HI>Thursday</HI> last, which came from St. <HI>Mallowes,</HI> by which we received Intelligence as followeth. The <HI>French</HI> Pyrats do daily much mischief, not onely to the <HI>English,</HI> but also to the <HI>Hollander</HI> and <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and others which they light upon, they have lately taken two <HI>Marchants</HI> Ships belong∣ing to <HI>Genua,</HI> and are become worse Enemies to Trade then ever the <HI>Dunkerks</HI> were: wherefore the Marchants in the low Countries, are furnishing out a Fleet of twenty
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Sale to help to scoure the narrow Seas: the like we hear is intended by the <HI>Spanish</HI> and others, and it hath been long expected that our own Countreymen the Marchants of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> would [if possible] have had the honour of giving the first example in this kind.</P>
<P>From <HI>Scotland</HI> we are advertized, that the Cavalier party are extreamly dejected, and even stand amazed at the manner of putting <HI>Montrosse</HI> to death, which they chiefly attribute to the leading censure of the <HI>Kirk;</HI> they say that a man deserves some favour for humanity sake, but that such a man that for goodliness of person, and neat de∣portment, is not to be paralleld in <HI>Scotland,</HI> should be given up to Satan, and sent suddenly to Hell, without lon∣ger time of repentance, hath scarce been heard of, yet least his temporal punishment should not be so great in another world, as he was adjudged to deserve in this: the tortures inflicted on him at his death, were more then ordinary, nei∣ther after death could the Kirk with safety bless that part of his Karkess which was to be buried, and indeed what reason had they for it; for how knew they what he had eaten, or lay undigested in his stinking guts and garbage, unfit to be put in their holy consecrated ground; yet for all this, the Clergy will be reconciled with their King, and say they will receive him into the bosome of the kirk; but why may not he fear the same sentence with <HI>Montrosse,</HI> if <HI>Montrosse</HI> acted by his Commission, and had not received any countermand. Notwithstanding their declared King having received Letters, certifying that <HI>Montrosse</HI> was dead, declared that he approved thereof, and being told by some that were about him, that he had lost one of his best Servants; he re∣plyed that he could not fetch him again, and if he should shew any distast at what had past, it was in the power of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to make the Treaty null and void;
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>by which it appeares, that the life of him whose dependance was the strength of his Princes assurance, is as soone lost in his affection, as his miscarriage happened in the action, his thoughts being mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e inlarged, and thereby can the ea∣sier overlook the first election, knowing that no further ser∣vice can be expected from that instrument, some think his coming into <HI>Scotland</HI> will be retarded, and its very impro∣bable he should be crowned in <HI>Scotland</HI> the <HI>29.</HI> of May, for some letters of the <HI>26.</HI> of that moneth say, that he was then at <HI>Breda,</HI> and had a Guard of about <HI>200.</HI> men attending his person; in the mean while, the Parliaments Army march this way with an intent [as we heare] to go farther North, they behave themselves very civilly: insomuch, that the Countrey people love them as Brethren, and honour their Commanders, as men most exquisite in observation of good discipline, they take nothing but what is onely neces∣sary for their present sustenance, and are willing to give money for it, and are careful not to give any just cause of offence, and are frugall in their expences, carrying them∣selves as if they coveted no other recompence for their pains then for the glory of doing well. Great cause there∣fore have the Countrey to respect such men, which after the mustering of thousands of enemies are so well able to go∣vern themselves; whereas if the poor Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be ne∣ver so much injured, they can revenge themselves no wayes but with teares, [and those sometimes prove bitter] but o∣thers can do it by Armes.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Windsor.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis day his Excellency the Lord Ge∣nerall CROMWEL came to WINSOR, where he was entertained with many vollies of shot, his Lady also met him here, and many persons of eminency, Members of Parliament, and of the Councel of State, and chief Officers of the Army; after much time spent in expressing civil respects one to ano∣ther, and in congratulating his welcome thi∣ther, they had some discourse on the affaires of Ireland, and of the prosperous success wherewith it hath pleased God to crown his undertakings. For the carrying on of which work in Ireland, there is Sir Hardres Waller, Collonel Venable, Sir Charles Coot, col. Hew∣son, col. Hugh Peters, and many other faithful and deserving Commanders, who both in Valour and Discipline, will truly imitate the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>vertues of their General, till he return thither again. And this is it which all men ought to follow that they hear or see in others; for as a Learned Man saith, <HI>The race of Men are Men; but the race of Soules are Vertues, and Sanctity.</HI></P>
<P>The Generall had an indifferent good pas∣sage from Ireland to Bristol, and was not so Sea-sick, as when he first went over thither from Bristol to Windsor, he came with a small retinue of his own Servants, and some few Gentlemen and Officers of the Army, he shews himself very affable, and courteous unto all, and as time will afford, admitteth a∣ny man that hath business, to speak with him.</P>
<P>This Evening came some part of Collonel Riches Regiment of Horse, and most of the Innes in Town are full of guests, which come from London on purpose to attend him in his way to morrow. They tell us that a great number wil also meet him by the way, in his passage to London; but his Lordship expres∣seth much humility, and when any Victory obtained is spoken of, he acknowledgeth God to be all in all, and saith, that that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of God shall stand, but if it be not of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will come to naught.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>He also declareth, That it is not sutable to his de∣sire, to come up to <HI>London</HI> in great Pomp and Glory, yet because men would not be thought guilty of that abominable vice of ingratitude, and for that Worthy, deeds are not to be requited with neglect, it may be decent and seemly, for such as are well-wishers to the common good, to testifie their affections this way, which may be done without ostentation in the one, or ascribing more then is due by the other.</P>
