And it is further Ordered and Ordai∣ned, That there shall be true and faithfull Inventories ta∣ken of the Ships, Ammunition, Moneyes, Goods, Plate, Pillage and Spoile which shall be taken by vertue and authority of this present Ordinance, and a true Ap∣praysement made of the same, and the same together with all papers and writings found in any Ship, or other Vessell by them to be taken, shall be carefully pre∣served, and two or three of the Officers of every Ship, or other Vessell so taken, shall be exami∣ned
