<HEAD>A brief RELATION OF The occasion and manner of the late fight in the Downs, betwixt the Fleet of the Common-wealth of England under the command of Gener all Blague, and that of the States of the united Provinces under the command of Admiral Trump, May, 19 1652. according to an accompt gi∣ven by divers who were eye-wit∣nesses of the action.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Efore we proced to the main, it will be ne∣cessary to give you (as a preparative there∣unto) a short view of the behaviour of certain Dutch ships towards Capt. Young, Capt. of the President Frigot.</P>
<P>As Captain Young was comming to the Westward, to take the command of the West-guard,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>the 12 instant, he discried a Fleet of about 12 sail com∣ming from the Southward; and making sail off to them, he found them to be a Fleet of Hollanders come from Genoa and Legorn. Three with Flags were states men of war for convoy, the rest Merchants ships. Hereupon Captain Young sent his Master to the Admirall to let them know that amity was as yet continued between the two States, and therefore that he summoned him to strike.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Admirall took in his Flagg, and put a∣broad a P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndant, saying he belonged to Amsterdam. But then the Vice-Admirall came up with his Flagg abroad, being a ship of 42 guns who would by no means be per∣swaded to strike, though called on over and over. Then Captain Young fitting himself gave him abroad side, and received another from him, which made the rest to in∣gage, but after the exchange of four or five broad sides, Captain Reynolds and Captain Chapman comming in, the Rear and Vice-Admirall also were at length forced to strike; which being done, they were civilly used in regard of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e treaty on foot betwixt both nations.</P>
<P>The Vice Admirall was much shattered, and it seems nothing but pure necessity made him strike, for, he sent Capt. Young word that his ship was ready to sink having four foot water in the hold; and that he had order from the States, that if he struck he should loose his head for it.</P>
<P>Now that which in the next place is most remarkable is the behaviour or the Dutch the day before this last fight; which seemed very fair.</P>
<P>For, Upon the 18 instant, Van Trump with a Fleet of 42 sail on the back side of Goodwins sands, was dis∣covered by Major Bourn who command the Andrew,
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>and by the rest of our ships riding in the Downs. They bearing towards the Road, Major Bourn commmanded the Greyhound to make sail and to stand out and speak with them, who when she came near struck their Top sails, demeaning themselves civilly, and saying, they came from Admiral Trump with a message to the commander in chief in the Downs. Hereupon they stood out in the Road with our Squadron, and comming aboard, they in the name of their General very plausibly saluted our ships with this account, in order they said) unto the sa∣tisfaction of this nation; how that the Northerly winds having blown hard for divers days, they were put fur∣ther to the Sout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ward then they intended, they having rode for some days off Dunkirk, where they had lost se∣verall of their Anchors and cables; adding that they had no intention of injury to the English nation.</P>
<P>Yet even at that time, our ships were jealous they had some design in their so near approach, because an expres∣sion dropped from one of their Captains in discourse, which did import that they were unwilling to strike their flagg. And however disguised, their comming thus could be no lesse then a Bravado, since it was then in their choice whether they would have came so near our Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et or no; Gen. Blague was at that time also Westward with the greatest part of the Fleet, to whom Major Bourn im∣mediately sent an expresse of all that passed, and ordered the Assurance and the Grey hound to he near their Fleet that night, to observe their motion.</P>
<P>Generall Blague being in Rye Bay, did there r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceive the expresse with an account of all from Major Bourn; whereupon he made all possible speed to ply up towards them, and on VVednesday the nineteenth instant in the
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>morning, he saw them at Anchor in and near Dover road.</P>
<P>Being come within three Leagues of them, they weigh∣ed, and stood away by a wind to the East-ward, our Fleet supposing their intention was to leave us to avoid the dispute of the Flag. About two hours after they altered their course; For, a Captain of their own, now our prisoner, confesseth, that as they rode off towards the French coast, a ship of the States of Holland came to∣wards them, and made a waft with his Flag to Vantrump, who bore up to that ship, and a boat went from that a∣board Vantrump. Whereupon he immediately made all the sail he could, hastening with his Fleet towards ours, and bore up directly with our Fleet, himself being head∣most of his own.</P>
<P>Being come near, within Musquet-shot, Gen. Blague shot a Gun. but without a Ball, at his Flag; which he did also twice more, Vantrump answering him with a Gun on the averse side of his ship, which signified a high disdain or scorn (according to the Sea-custome) and then immediately, instead of striking (according to the ancient Usage) hee hung out a red Flag, which his Of∣ficers that wee have taken, confesse was the Signall, and gave our General a Broad-side, and so the fight began about four of the Clock in the Evening, farre otherwise then what hath beene reported by Trump himselfe, and others.</P>
<P>Then Major Bourn coming in to the engagement with eight ships more, the fight was continued for above foure hours till night parted them.</P>
<P>The next morning the Dutch Fleet was espied about four leagues distance from ours towards the Coast of France. What harme wee have done them is not fully
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>knowne, but one of them was supposed to bee sunke, and another of thirty Guns we have taken, with the Captains of both, the Maine-mast of the first beeing shot by the Board, and much water in the Hold, which made one of our Captaines to give her over as in a sinking condi∣tion. We have six men of our Admirals slain, and nine or ten desperately wounded, and five and twenty more not without danger, among them the Master and one of his Mates.</P>
<P>The Admiral received above seventy great shot in the Hull and Masts; but in the Sails and Rigging without number, having ingaged some time alone with the whole body of the Dutch Fleet; and though he were the princi∣pal man that they aimed at, yet he came off wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h honour.</P>
<P>One thing may not be omitted, that upon news of this fight, divers sea men of Dover, Deal, and Sandwich, to the number of three hundred voluntarily boated them∣selves to our Fleet; and though ingaged in the Generalls ship, in the heat of the fight, came off without the losse of one man.</P>
<P>Since this, we understand that Generall Blague plies to and again with his Fleet, being well reinforced, and that Trump with his Fleet is returned home. We have pri∣soners of the Dutch two Captains, two Lievtenant, and about a hundred and fifty others.</P>
<P>One thing more is to be added to our fore-going rela∣tion, which is very observable; how that as Trump came on towards our Admirall, he commanded up two of his men, who kept still at the top of his Main Mast, as if they ment to take down the flagg; a pretty mysterious pas∣sage to amuse us touching their intention. We shall make no inference upon the whole matter, but leave the world to judge.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P> Since this great blow given by the English, the States of Holland have called a General Councel, whose results tended to peace and unity with the Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-wealth of England, and declared their Resolutions for a Union. Yet notwithstanding, many of them seemed to own what Van Trump had done in the precedent action, and to that end, Declared, That an Act, or Edict, should be forthwith published in reference thereunto. But the States General are clear of a contrary opinion, and seem to be exceeding∣ly exasperated against all those that shall be instrumen∣tal, aiding, contriving, or assisting, in making a breach with England.</P>
<P>There is an additional Fleet of 100 sail setting forth, their Design pretended, for the safety and preservation of the United Provinces: Nevertheless, many of the Dutchmen rage exceedingly, and swear to be revenged of the English. Their great Threats are little to be feared; and as they liked their last Supper, so let them prepare for a Break-fast.</P>
