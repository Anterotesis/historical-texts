<HEAD>A Bloudy FIGHT IN CORNWALL Between the Princes Forces commanded by the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Parliaments Forces, neer <HI>Pen∣dennis</HI> Castle, and a great Victory obtained at Sea.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> with 20 Sayle of ships, lies floting up and downe the Brittish Coast; insomuch that no ships can passe nor escape his fury; For, on Tuesday last a Fleet of Marchants sayling towards the Lands-End, were set upon by the <HI>Hoptonians,</HI> who coming within shot of them gave them a broad side;
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>but were answered with the like volley from them a∣gain; insomuch, that they came to a hot dispute, the fight continuing many hours, and after the exchange of severall tokens from the Sons of <HI>Mars,</HI> the L. <HI>Hopton</HI> held off, refusing to fight any longer, and steered to∣wards the Isle of <HI>Scilley;</HI> the famous ship called the <HI>Cul∣pepper,</HI> &amp; about 6 more chased them about 2 leagues, sunk three of them, the rest escaped: in this fight many were slain and wounded on both sides, and one of the Marchants ships sunk also, above 100 Mariners sacrifi∣cing their lives in this engagement. The fight being en∣ded, the Marchants Fleet hoysted sayl, &amp; steerd toward the Lands-End; which being done, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> put to Sea again, and (being thirsty of revenge) after few hours sayl, he espyed a prey, who with fury and rage made towards them, gave them a broad side, surroun∣ded them (although 8 in number) insomuch that three of them were close beset, and severall times ready to board; but by their undanted courage and gallantry repulsed them, disputed the Onset, and were in a good way to have got safe from them, but a supply of more shipping coming afterwards from <HI>Scilley,</HI> joyned with the first Squadron, who by their great potency and strength overpowred them boarded the ships, seized on all the goods and marchandize, tying every man back to back, shutting them under Decks, and carryed them prisoners to the Isle of Scilley, where they now remain under the barbarous restraint of Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> the Governour; <HI>God in his due time restore them to liberty, and grant them patiense, in this their time of affliction.</HI></P>
<P>If speedy and timely supplies of shipping be not hast∣ned forth, it is to be feared, they will become sole ma∣sters
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>of the Brittish Seas. Since their taking of the late prize, they have met with another <HI>Bristoll</HI> ship, richly laden with cloth, which the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> hath distri∣buted amongst the sea-men and souldiers. He is now sayled towards <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, but by the way, hee struck in at a Creek neer <HI>Pendennis,</HI> where he landed many of his men for the fetching in of provision, and other accommodation; but before they could facili∣ate and accomplish their Design, the <HI>Parliaments</HI> For∣ces at <HI>Pendennis</HI> having notice thereof, a considerable party of Horse and Foot were forthwith commanded out, who hastned to welcome their coming in, and en∣deavoured to get between them and the water, for the intercepting of their passage; but through the maligni∣ty of the Cornish-men their design was almost fru∣strated; for after few hours march they were disco∣vered, and the Enemy in a posture to receive them, who upon their neer approach saluted each other with the tokens of <HI>Mars,</HI> and after a hot conflict the <HI>Hoptoni∣ans</HI> retreated within command of their Ships, our men pursued, kiled 19. wounded many, and made good their retreat with the losse of 7 men. Their Ordnance did much retard our pursuit, by which meanes most of them got safe aboard having many Boats in readi∣nesse to receive them; otherwise few of them had e∣scaped: some of the Land souldiers deserted them at their coming ashore, who say, That the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> is commander in chief of that Squadron, and of all the Land forces thereunto belonging, and that his Colours (or Ensigns) are yelow, with black bulers in the midst, and on the top thereof, this Motto written in Chara∣cters of Gold, <HI>For Charles the second.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We hear that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is come to Helver sluce, accompanied by the prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> and many other Gentlemen of eminency, and after some confe∣rence between them, his Highnesse took his leave, and took shipping for <HI>Jersey,</HI> (as it is reported) who going aboard the <HI>Convertine,</HI> lanched forth into the Ocean with a pleasant Gatle, the great Guns bidding <HI>Vale</HI> to his departure; there are gone with him the Marquesse of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> the Lord <HI>Culpepper,</HI> the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> Major Gen. <HI>Massey,</HI> and many others; and from Jersey its said they are resolved for <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the Prince intends to set up his Standard against the parliament of <HI>Eng∣land, evill Councell prevaile much:</HI> the ships who trans∣ported them from hence were all Men of war, being 8 in number, His Highnesse is very potent, and numerous in shipping, who seize and take severall prizes at Sea, which doth much propagate their design; insomuch, that many English Factors, have solicited Him, desiring that speedy care may be taken for prevention thereof, and after some consultation with his Councell in re∣ference to the same, He declared, and promsied, That if the Marchants of the City of <HI>London</HI> would gather and advance the sum of 40000. <HI>l.</HI> for the maintenance of his Navy at Sea, the like should be prevented for the future; and to the end there might be free trading &amp; commerce at Sea, He was resolved to send a message, to acquaint them with these his desires, &amp;c. The Clergy are exceedingly inraged at the transactions in <HI>England,</HI> and do incite the people to desperate engagements for revenge of the Royall bloud, and investing <HI>Charles</HI> the second in his Throne: But the States at a general coun∣cel resolved, That proclamation should be made tho∣row
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>out the United Provinces, That such Ministers as should hereafter preach either publikely or privately, any thing concerning State affairs, either in relation to the differences of <HI>England, Scotland, France,</HI> or else∣where, or should hold any private correspondency from <HI>England,</HI> or else-where, as to that purpose should be forthwith banished. This Proclamation was pro∣claimed by Order from the States.</P>

<P>On the 28. a great storm arose in the hearts of ma∣ny throughout the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>West minster,</HI> occasioned by the apprehending of Lteut. col. <HI>Joh.

<P>Upon the apprehending of the aforesaid persons many jealousies arose in relation to a rising within the city for the rescuing of them from the power of the Souldiers; but their Guardiants conducted them safe to White Hall, and upon Thursday last the said Lieu. Col. <HI>Lilburn</HI> was brought before the Councel of State sitting at <HI>Derby</HI> house, and upon his examination, decla∣red, <HI>That he was a true and cordiall lover of</HI> England's <HI>peace and freedom, that he would sacrifice his life for the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>preservation of the rights and liberties thereof, and that he would rather suffer a thousand tortures, then betray his trust, or desert his first principles and engagement.</HI> Some other of the Citizens were also examined, who gave very strange Answers, &amp;c.</P>

Gen. <HI>Crumwell,</HI> Captain Generall of all the Forces which are to be expedited over for the reducement of that kingdom, and bringing of it to the obedience of Parl. He hath declared to the House his willingnesse and acceptance for this present expedi∣on; and in order thereunto, several propositions were proposed and debated, a copy whereof followeth. 1 That such Reg. as go may have all their arrears audited, sta∣ted, &amp; Debenters given. 2 That visible security be given for so much as shal appear due, and to be paid to any Trustee or friend with whom the Debenter shall be left. 3 That such of the army as undertake shal have their Arrears from the year 1645. first paid. 4 That ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the six score thousand l. <HI>per mensem,</HI> appoin∣ted for <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> three moneths pay be carryed over with those that go. 5 The privat Soldier &amp; non commission Officer to have two moneths pay of Arrears, and all Officers under Captains one moneths pay. 6 That <HI>Bristol, Chester.
