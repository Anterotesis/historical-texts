<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>The Lord is then best praised, when we acknowledge him to be his own praise.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">J</SEG>Anuary</HI> the first 1649. We embarqued from <HI>Wexford</HI> in the <HI>Hector</HI> for <HI>Corke,</HI> sayled two or three leagues beyond <HI>Greenor-bay,</HI> but were driven back, the wind turning upon us: upon the Saturday following the wind being fair we got within sight of <HI>Dungarvan,</HI> that night proved very windy, and about four in the morning, on the Lords day, a very tempestu∣ous wind arose, and the storm was the great∣est that ever any of the Sea-men knew (as they said) the wind was at South-east very thick, we hoped to fetch <HI>Corke,</HI> being within a mile of the shore, but could not possibly make land: in that distress we put to sea, hoping by that way to save life, the wind continued all that Sabbath day at South-east, South-east and by South, and south south-east, which if the wind had held at south east as it was in the morning, we could not have doubled the point about the land, but had been cast upon the rocks: we bore two courses to keep off from the shore all the day, and being as we supposed about the pitch of the Cape Cleere, at nine on Sabbath day night we shipt a great Sea which split and carryed away our foresaile, and so were forced to bring to a fore-top sail to keep from the shore, and so bore that fore-tope-saile till two in the night, in which time we were forced to cut our Anchor from the bough to save the ship from foundring, we having at that time five foot water in the hold. The Monday morning we were ten leagues to leeward of the Cape Cleere, and the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>wind was up at South-west, then we made all the sayl possible to fetch some harbour, and it pleased God, we made the Cape, hoping to fetch <HI>Baltamore,</HI> but the wind coming up at South-east and by east, we were forced to Sea again all the night, the wind continuing at south-east, south-east and by south, and south-south-east.</P>
<P>Tuesday we made the Misne head and could fetch no harbour the wind being still at south-east. Wednesday the wind came up at west, and we made for shore again, and came up as high as <HI>Gally-head</HI> hoping to fetch <HI>Kinsale;</HI> about three in the after-noone the wind came up at east south-east, and then we hoped to recover <HI>Castlehaven</HI> before night, and made for it, and in our running in, the wind veared at south-east and blew very fresh, and we still hoping to gain the harbour, ran in, knowing no other way to save life, the wind being so contrary, it grew extraordinary thick, rained and blew much, we fired three or four pieces of ordnance (for lights) and saw one light from the Castle, as we supposed, and two other lights to the East∣ward, which put us to an amazement, not knowing whether they were friends or enemies, and could not possibly see the going into the Harbor, but were in the very breach of the shore, the sight where∣of caused a great scrick in the ship, and thereupon brought our ship to, hoping thereby to have come to an Anchor, which if we had done, we had been past all hopes of life, the rock being so neer would have cut our Anchor, but God being most merciful in that nick of time, the seamen despairing of life, the wind at an instant came up at East, which carried us into the sea, and yet so great was the danger, that if the wind did not turn again to the West in less then half an hour, we were dead men, by reason of the rocks called the <HI>Staggs,</HI> so we came in a little time within sight of the rocks, the wind driving us strongly upon them, and then seeing the rocks within a ships length of us, we put our ship to stay, which she would not the sea being so extremely grown, the Sea-men being at their wits end, wishing us to prepare for death: the Lord again at that very instant caused the wind to come up at South-west, which carryed us out into the Sea cleer from the rocks where we had the wind favorable that night, and blessed be God on Thursday we came into <HI>Kinsale,</HI> it being the first Harbor that the Lord was pleased to give us, but that which is most admirable is this, that so soon as the ship was come into <HI>Kinsale</HI> Har∣bor, she leaked so very much, that the Sea-men came the next morn∣ing and told us, that they were almost drowned that night, and could
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>scarce keep the ship alive in the Harbor, and were forced the next tide to bring her to the Key, and at the Ebbe to repair her, and had much ado to keep her from sinking. This being the method of Gods dealing with us in our passage,</P>
<P>Now concerning the work of God upon my spirit during the storm, thus it was. Towards the evening of the Sabbath day <HI>January</HI> the 5. my heart was exceeding sad and sorrowfull even unto death, a nark night approaching, and the ship taking in much water, my spirit fainted and my heart sunk within me, the sorrows of death caught hold of me, much grieved I was for my poor dear heart who did not express half so much fear as my self, many sweet expressions she used in prayers, wishing me to call earnestly upon God: many words I could not use, but my heart was praying; it almost broke my heart to think what my wives friends would say in <HI>England,</HI> that I should bring her into <HI>Ireland</HI> to drown her (though I bless God she never repined at it) troubled I was likewise for my poor servants that came in love along with us; it almost split my heart to think what the Malignants would say in <HI>England</HI> when they hear that we were drowned (how they would abuse that passage of <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 28.4.) That though vengeance hath not overtaken me at Land, yet I was met withall at Sea; much troubled I was at the manner of the death, such extraordinary violent deaths importing the na∣ture of some heavy Judgement, as if the Lord had been displeased with us, and had not sent us, and <HI>Jonahs</HI> storm was much in my thoughts (I having spoken some words of Exhortation to the com∣pany out of that Scripture before the storm began) for God sent that great storm, <HI>Jon.</HI> 1.4. because <HI>Jonah</HI> went contrary to his Commands, where I observed, That when a Christian is in Gods way, upon Gods errand sent to Sea, usually God makes the Winde and the Seas fa∣vourable to him; upon such considerations, and many objections made by flesh &amp; blood, I had very much trouble with my unbelieving heart, &amp; could not bring my mind to be willing to die, earnest I had been in secret prayer at the Throne of Grace before, for 16. or 18. hours to∣gether, pleading with the Lord, that if it were possible this cup of his indignation might pass over us, that in Judgments he would remem∣ber Mercy, however that we might cheerfully submit to his sweet pleasure; the materials of my long suggested prayers were meditations and applications of severall Scriptures which mention Gods power,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>wisdome and love in the Seas. God having put it into my minde not long before to note most of the chief places in Scripture con∣cerning the Seas, as proper and usefull for a Sea-voyage. I prest my deere Christ not to drown us, for said I, we fight for thy King∣ly office, throw the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and all thy implacable enemies into the midst of the Sea, but let us be preserved that we may prayse thy Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.27, 30. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15.1. Lord this is a calamity too heavy for thy poor creatures to bear. <HI>Iob</HI> 6.3. were it not that thou hast cast our sinnes into the depths of the Seas: <HI>Micha</HI> 7.19. Lord suffer not the deeps to swallow us up: <HI>Psal.</HI> 69.15. Let not all thy waves and billowes passe over us We have seen thy wonders in the deep: <HI>Psal.</HI> 107.23. And if thou save us we shall declare them to the children of men; but if thou make our graves in the Sea, the dead cannot praise thee: <HI>Psal.</HI> 115.17. thou Lord which leadest thy servants through the deep, prepare dry Land for us: Lord, why should not the Seas be as favorable to thy servants as the dry land? Thou layest up the depth in storehouses. <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.7. Thou Lord canst still the noyse of the waves <HI>Psal.</HI> 65.7. <HI>Ps.</HI> 68.22. was a comfortable place to me, that the Lord promised to bring againe his people from the depth of the Sea. Sweet Christ do thy office and be a Saviour to thy people both for soules and bodies, thou layest the beams of thy Chambers in the waters 10.4. <HI>Psal.</HI> 3. and rulest the raging of the Seas. <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.9. Now Lord the floods have lifted up their voyce and their waves: <HI>Psal.</HI> 93.2. but thou art mightier then the mighty waves of the Sea, The fishes of the Sea shall shrink at thy presence: but why art thou so angry with thy servants who are sent in thy service? Lord cast the great Dragon into the bottomlesse pit, that old Ser∣pent called the Devill and Sathan. <HI>Revel.</HI> 12.9. but let thy people live to prayse thee; thou Lord canst say to the Sea, Be dry: <HI>Esa.</HI> 44.27. <HI>Esa.</HI> 50.2. and canst easily bring us safe to land Lord, hast not thou made the depths of the Sea a way for thy ransomed ones to pass over? <HI>Esa.</HI> 51.10. Why must then thy servants be drowned as if they were in this malefactors? <HI>Ionah</HI> ran away from thee and would not obey thee, being unwilling to be the mouth and proclaimer of thy Iustice upon <HI>Nineveh</HI> the head of the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Empire: and thou sentest out a great winde, and there was a mighty tempest in the Sea, <HI>Ionah.</HI> 4. which was no ordinary wind, but sent as a punishment for his disobedince, yet because he was thy servant, and was not selvish,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>nor displeased in thy shewing mercy for feare of his being thought a false prophet, but out of zeale for thy glory which he thought was wronged and obscured by that change, and out of his ardent affecti∣ton to thy people that their enemies should live; and though he said, he did well to be angry, even unto death, they being not words of expresse rebellion, but of a passionate spirit blinded with anger, therefore when he prayed unto thee out of the belly of Hell, he was mightily preserved. Now Lord, thou which wast a God so gracious and merciful slow to anger, &amp; of great kindness towards the Heathens in <HI>Nineveh</HI> shall not we find thy mercy? if thou hast any further work for us to do in our generation, we shall. Lord, it is the wicked that is like the troubled Sea, whose water casts up mire and dirt <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.20. Thy Justice was very wonderfull and glorious at <HI>Wexford,</HI> in drown∣ing those Pirates and wicked men in the Sea, that had done so much mischief to thy people in that Element, and what will thy enemies say when the carkasses of thy people are given to be food for the Fishes? Lord command this great wind into thy treasure, and bring forth windes serviceable for us that we may have an auspicious gale, and an expeditious saile into some Harbor where it shall please thy Majesty, for thy poor creatures are at their wits end, and death appears in their faces; thou only canst shut up the Sea with doors, <HI>Iob</HI> 38.8. Thou makest the deep to boyle like a pot, and makest the Sea like a pot of oyntment, as if the Sea was hoary by the long white frothy path, <HI>Job.</HI> 41.31, 32. Sweet Christ, thou hast dominion from sea to sea, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.8. and thou hast given to the sea a decree, that the waters passe not thy commands, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.29. Therefore though the sea roare and threaten to swallow us up, yet unless thou givest it a commission to devour us it cannot hurt us: sweet Christ, the sea is unto thee as the dry land, the winds and seas will obey thee, deere Redeemer wilt not thou speak one word to save the lives of thy own members? <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.26, 27. <HI>&amp;</HI> 14.27. <HI>Mark.</HI> 4.29. Peace, Be still, will make a great calme. Lord assure some of thy poor servants that all shall be well, as thou didst to blessed <HI>Paul Acts</HI> 27.23. Give some vision and manifestation of thy love, for it was for thy sake that we committed our selves to the sea, let some of thy servants in the ship be assured from heaven that we shall be safe, however Lord let thy will be our wils: with other Scriptures, not now perfectly remembred. Now after long prayers and medita∣tions,
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>it pleased God about six on the Sabboth day night that the Lord Jesus Christ began to quiet my spirit in himself, and I was well perswaded to die, and began to be ravisht with the Consideration of the joyes of Heaven, how quickly I and my poor heart should be in our Masters joyes, that expression of entring into my Masters joy af∣fected me much, that the joy was too big to enter into me, I must be swallowed up in it, and that my Masters joy could be no small joy; thereupon I spake comfortably to my wife, desiring her to cheer up, for that we should suddenly be in Heaven, if the Lord was pleased thus to take us to himself, who resigned her soul to God, and we took our leaves solemnly of each other, with our eyes full of teares, which I felt running down her cheeks when I kist them, saying that all teares shall suddenly be wiped from our eyes in Heaven, and with a great fervour of spirit I thought severall times to this purpose, Sweet Jesus I come to thee, we come not only in this Sea of waters, but Lord we come to thee in a Sea of blood if it shall please thee to call us; the storm still increased, and I grew exceeding heavy and sleepy, but roused my self up, and checked my heart, that I should <HI>Jonah</HI> like offer to sleep in such a storm: what, be drowned in my sleep! my wife often begged at me not to sleep, but I could not possibly for∣bear sleep, if it had been to have saved all our lives; so it pleased God, that sitting as upright as I could, I fell into as fast a sleep as ever I was in all my life.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>And in my sleep I dreamed.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat I was in an upper chamber with my sweet Redeemer Christ Jesus, and that there were many Suiters attended to speake with him; to beseech him to save their Ships and Barks that they might not perish by the storme, I thought it was a large roome, wherein there was a long table with an ordinary Car∣pet, and two candles standing upon it, two trenchers of Tobacco, and Pipes, and one Man walking up and downe by the toble▪ of a middle staturs, about thirty years of age, the hairs of his Head long and white as flax; but curling at the Ends, but the haire of his upper lipp browne, in sad coulor'd cloathes, and a cloth broad brim'd hatt, I asked him who he was, who said he waited upon Jesus Christ; I asked him where Jesus Christ was, he pointed to a Curtin, saying, there he is; I beheld and saw a glorious shi∣ning but no person, and methought Jesus Christ spake to me, and asked me what I would have, I said the lives of all in the Ship, said he in what ship said I in the <HI>Hector,</HI> it is a bad name said he, for such as professe me. <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux</HI> is for <HI>Heathens,</HI> I prayed him that we might not dye in this manner, sayes he to me are not you safe? but good Lord said I, I must returne, and I beg life for all in the ship, who are they said he? I answered that there was my deare Wife and three Servants. Lieutenant Colo∣nell <HI>Saunders,</HI> Major <HI>Bee,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hewes,</HI> honest <HI>Abraham,</HI> and other passingers thy Servants, (said Iesus Christ at my naming Lieu. Col. <HI>Saunders</HI> and some others, its so much the better that they are there) the Captaine and the Sea-men are serviceable to thy Cause, and they take wonderfull paines to save their owne lives and ours, but unlesse thou speake the word, the Sea will swallow us up. Then me thought Jesus Christ askt me why I was not willing to dye? I told him that by this death I could not glorifie him, thinking upon that Scripture, <HI>Iohn</HI> 21.19. and me thought I was something impatient that the Lord should surprize us, get∣ting us into a ship at his call for his Service, and then to drowne us, as if we were Parricides or hainous Malefactors, which by
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>Law were drowned: at that me thought Jesus Christ withdrew, as if he was displeased, said I, Lord, if thou drownest those that love thee, what wilt thou doe to thine Enemies? but could get no answer, whereupon I was sensible of my impatience, and thought that I fell downe flat downe on the ground, and cryed for Mer∣cy, saying Lord, we kisse thy Rod, and turne our naked backs, strike as much as thou pleasest. Lord, I plead nothing but thy free grace; it may be many of us have offended in excessive drinking, and now thou art punishing us in our owne Element, however our sinnes are more then the sands of the Sea-shore but let pi∣ty move thee to save us; thou sweet Redeemer which hast been at Sea in stormes, that art a mercifull high Priest, like unto us in all things but sinne. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.17. and 4.15. take pity upon thine owne flesh and blood; what Father but would save his Child from drewning if he could hast thou no worke for any of us to doe? I thought the answer was, but little to be done by some of us; (my Wife tells me that but a little before I slept, I said, cer∣tainly God had something for me, and others to doe for his ser∣vice, and therefore we should not dye at this time, which I did not remember;) sweet Christ hear us as thou didest thy Disciples save us quickly or else we perish, and being earnest in prayer, in my dreame me thought that the man in the roome came to me, and told me that this was no naturall storme of Gods sending, but an extraordinary Tempest raised by Satan (by Gods permission) to destroy those which were coming to fight against his Servants, and bad me use that argument to his Master. Thereupon I in∣stantly craved leave to speake, and said, sweet Saviour▪ if this Storme and Tempest be raised by Satan the Prince of the ayre as in <HI>Lapland</HI> and many other places where winds are sold, he works in the Children of disobedience, and hath nothing to doe with thy poore Servants, for though thou mayst justly for our sins give Satan power over us▪ as thou didst over thy dear Servant <HI>Iob.</HI> Yet where thou givest a particular faith to be free from Sa∣thans stormes and witchcrafts, thou art pleased to grant that which is believed, and in great love it pleased Jesus Christ to give a gratious answer to my Spirit, and said, be not afraid, your lives shall be saved; instantly replyed Lord, let it be for all the Persons in the Ship He said be it so, then I pressed for the goods in the Ship Lord said I, there are my L. Gen goods, &amp; M. Gn. goods; Let them safe, but they are not there said Jesus Christ, no Lord said I, they are fighting thy battells, Jesus Christ answered, the goods shall
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>all be safe. And the ship likewise, and nothing miscarry, then I gave humble thanks, and departed, and as I was going out, I thought Jesus Christ said to me, it is granted for halfe fifty, goe no more to Sea in winter. I further dream'd that the Devill and his Imps were very earnest with Jesus Christ to get leave to de∣stroy the Governour of Wexford, by the storme; but the Lord said, it should not be; some there were that had Barkes at Wez∣ford, that attended to speake with Jesus Christ, I could not tell what they said, they discoursed much about the Governour, and all that I heard Christ say, was that winter was not yet come for them at Wexford, then I thought I met with Captaine <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re∣bottell,</HI> who had very great respect showne to him, and I thought his prayers did us very much good, and he was very much com∣mended for his tendernesse to the sick Souldiers at Wexford, I thought there were other men from Wexford that came for safe passages, and one Officer was very earnest for a Ship that he was to come in, and I heard this expression concerning him, we must take speciall care of his Ship; for he was very tender and kinde to the poore sick Souldiers, and much discourse I heard about sick Souldiers. Jesus Christ said, if stormes will not doe, I have o∣ther afflictions to make them more tender-hearted and pitifull, me thought the person that so walked in the roome, spake much to this effect, that there would be many stormes by reason of much hardheartednesse, to breake and melt their Spirits, since which (blessed be God) Captaine <HI>Lucus</HI> is come safe in the wild <HI>Beare,</HI> one whom I observed in Wexford to be very liberall, tender-hearted, and compassionate to the poore Souldiers, whereupon I awaked, this dreame lasted about two houres, all which time the storme encreased, my Wife told me, that shee jogged me above twenty times to waken me. And wondred that I should sleep, seeing we were all so neere the point of death, said I to her, peace my dear heart, be quiet, we shall all be safe: Jesus Christ hath promised me our lives, be not afraid, and told her all my dreame, whereat she was much amazed, but could not believe any afety, and urged me to prayer, being her selfe well resolved to dye, cheerefully submitting to Gods good pleasure, but told me she had a strong impression upon her Spi∣rit by way of question, as if the Lord had spoken to her, that in case he should be pleased to spare her life at this time, whether she could be content to suffer for him, whereunto she found her heart most ready and willing, by the Lords assistance, to lay
<PB N="12" REF="7"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owne her life for his glory; but my owne heart was then giving thanks and bran full of comfort.</P>
<P>I related my dreame to Lieutenan Col. <HI>Saunders,</HI> Major <HI>Bee, Ben.</HI> and the two Maids that were in the Cabin. And sent in for Captaine <HI>Stoakes,</HI> the Master the Gunner, <HI>Bennet,</HI> and marshall and bad them be of good cheere, and plye their busi∣nesse for we should be all safe, telling them what I had dream∣ed, they admired at my confidence, and Captaine <HI>Stoakes</HI> could not believe it, (said he) I know God is very Mercifull and can doe much; but the Ship hath five foot water in the hould which the Pumpe could not reach being choaked, and very subject to leaks, being twenty years old, and then it was about nine at night, the storme increasing, and they not knowing where about they were, I told them that I was assured of safety, as if I were on Shore and one word more I had dreamed, which I told them of said I to Jesus Christ, what if the Ship should break asunder? He answered me, you shall be as safe as if you were in <HI>Codds</HI> Boat (a Boat at Wexford that we went in towards the ship in the bay, and were driven back severall times) or as if you were in the Go∣vernors house in Wexford what impression it had upon their Spi∣rits I know not, but some that were in the great Cabbin told me that they did verily beleeve it, and that their hearts were much quieted by what I said. The storme increased and a great noyse was made in the ship, the water came in at the great Cabbine windowes, the ship ready to overset and to founder; many skreaks and cryes out now we are gone, and yet my confidence and assu∣rance increased, I bad them pray and bethankfull for they were as safe as if they were on shoare still my poore Wife said it could not be I told her I was sure of it; she must lye still and see the salva∣tion of our God.</P>
<P>I confesse I much marvelled at the change that was wrought in my own Spirit, from a trembling fearfulnesse to a rejoycing assurance and considering it was but a dreame I thought I might presume too much in an over Confidence and was jealous over my owne hart least I should offend, begging the Lords extraor∣dinary assistance sutable to the present danger, but the more I checkt my heart of presumption; the more did my faith mount upon the wing as if I had been upon dry ground, and had not so much fear as the thousand part of the weight of a haire: the poor ship workt for her life, and the Sea-men took infinite paines, two parts being fallen sick &amp; the other 30. were continually at it, som∣times
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>they were in a little hopes, sometimes their Soules ready to faint about twelve at night, he that was at the Helme by my Cabbin said all was broken, the water came in there, a little be∣fore they cryed out, that the foresaile was split and carried away, and the Anchors thrown over board to lighten the ship, yet all this while my Spirit was the same in a thankfull admiration, for so great a deliverance, and said, all shall be as well as heart could wish, when they spoke of lightning the ship, my wife cald to Capt. <HI>Stoaks</HI> and bad him if he thought fit to throw over some Trunkes which we had in the ship, which I like very well (as it was in <HI>Pauls</HI>-storm) in regard of others that were in the ship, but for my own part, I said I would not have any thing throwne over, for I knew all would be well and (so blessed be the Lord of Seas) about four in the morning, the storme abated, my heart was in a very thankfull posture, and that Wednesday night after, when the Sea-men said, we were in most danger entring into <HI>Castle-Haven</HI> in the dark, that we must have the wind turne twice in halfe an houre to save us, first to carry us from the breach of the shoare to the <HI>Staggs,</HI> and then to carry us off from them: when we were within a Cables length of the shoare, and the Sea∣men devided, not knowing what to do Captaine <HI>Stoakes</HI> bad let fall an Anchor, or else we are all dead-men others saib, try to get off from shoare, and there was a great skreak that all was gone, I was not one jot afraid, but told them they were sure to get safe to Land, and the ship to a Harbour, and the Lord shewed himselfe kind to poore sinners.</P>
<P>One thing though it seeme to be of small importance, yet it runs much in my mind, and I must needs relate it. I thought that Jesus Christ said to me that the goods should be all safe, and nothing hurt or loft by the storme, but when we came to look for our things we mist a looking-glasse and a Pistoll, the glasse case was all broke and shivered in many peeces by the rouling of the ship, being in one of the Boxes or Cabin-chests in the great Cabbin amongst other things but the Glasse it selfe was not so much as broken or crackt and the case though in eight or ten peeces yet might easily be joyned and glued together, that it is not worse by a farthing, which seemes to me very admirable, I told Captaine <HI>Stoakes</HI> of it, and desired him, if possible, to help me to my Pi∣stoll, he examined them about it; but it could not be heard of, till the very day the ship was going out of the Harbour, and then somebody that had it could not be quiet till he brought it out,
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>to let us see how weak our faith and confidence is in the Lord and that he will performe with his poore servants to a Title of his promise.</P>
<P>I know that usually dreames follow mens naturall inclination or their daily conversation, as in <HI>Pharaohs Butler</HI> and <HI>Baker,</HI> they dreamed of wine and baskets of meate, matters about which they were ordinarily imployed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 40. and I having beene in a continued meditation of Jesus Christ his love, power, bowells of pitty towards his members, it was most likely, that if I dreamed of any thing I should dreame of him as mary times upon the Sab∣boths nights: I have dreamed that I was in the very same company and at the same exercises as I was upon the day, and indeed the consideration of Christs humanity his being at Sea, and his experimentall knowledge of our miseries much supported me, how many prayers did we put up for a safe passage which though they do not move the Lord by any eloquence, as an Orator moves his hearers, yet they move the Lord; as the cryes of children make the bowels of thelr Parents yearne towards them, and we must distinguish between shadowes and substances, dreames are but the appearances of things which are not, naturall dreams are ei∣ther sinfull, deceitfull &amp; vaine, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.8. the hungry thirsty man dreames, that he eats and drinks, but he awakes and his soule is faint for food, or else they are representations of things past which were really done or things to come which falls out accor∣dingly and the matter of the dreame is principally to be regarded, some Christians have had difficult places of Scripture expounded to them in their dreames, as they have told me.</P>
<P>Therefore although dreames which are naturall and ordinary be of little or no account yet extraordinary dreames many times prove true, as if one cry in his dream or be so fast aslcep that he feels not pinching when the Imagination is so extraordinarily powerfull, and that the party dreaming is confidently perswaded that it will come to passe it commonly proves accordingly as that of <HI>Katherin de Medicis</HI> Queen of France, who dreamed that <HI>Hen.</HI> the Second, should be killed at the Tilt, and said she would venture her soule upon it. And so he was killed by a Scots man, <HI>Montgomery</HI> as she dreamed; <HI>Petrarch</HI> in <HI>Pado∣va</HI> dreamed that a <HI>Scorpion</HI> stung him to death, that was in one of the Lyons that stand before a statue which they fondly call <HI>Sancta Iustina,</HI> the next morning he told his dreame, went thither and put in his hund into the hole and out came a Scorpion which
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>poysoned him, whereof he dyed, the great Souldier <HI>Farese</HI> the night before he dyed; dreamed that he was drowned and that his Saint <HI>Christopher</HI> could not carry him over the River and the next day the Ferry-boat sunk and he was drowned.</P>
<P>In 1629. <HI>Christina</HI> a Protestant Marquesses Daughter in <HI>Poland,</HI> dreamed that Jesus Christ had told her comfortable things for the Protestants, as the good successe of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the death of the Emperors Generall <HI>Walston</HI> and that it might be the better believed, she should dye four dayes and re∣vive againe, one Minister <HI>Cotu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius</HI> slighted it as a delusion and vaine fancie, she told him that God was angry with him, and such a day his only child should dye and himselfe presently after, which both proved true, she likewise fell into a Trance for eight and fourty houres and then revived and foretold victories of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> but that God would take him away, because the people began to make a God of him and thought him to be in∣vincible. She dreamed that she was married to Jesus Christ, and that she had a Crown of Glory promised her if she could persevere in the faith, and told her she would be mockt and scoft at by many who would not believe but that such visions procee∣ded from imagination, melancholly humours or weaknesse of braine, but bad her not be d scouraged, shewing her a cup of blood, which he said he would poure upon those that persecute his servants, and that she prayed very earnestly for the salvation of a deerfriend of hers who was in armes against the Protestants, but that shee could not prevaile for the salvation of any of her friends, but only for her s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe and that night the same party d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, she likewise in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er dreame saw two great persons comming to be judged one a Papist who had pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his St. <HI>Francis</HI> and desired to be admitted into Heaven, but Jesus Christ bad him go to H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint <HI>Francis,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he was immediatly dragged; and the other was a Prow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> who argued for his sal∣vation, because he fought against the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and the Ministers as∣sured him of Heaver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus Christ said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will put out his candle in Germany, for it gives a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> light, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> without but it is full of filth and selfe righteousnesse with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> likewise saw a man upon a Tree adored by many; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lyons came to the Tree and pluckt it down, and an Eagle was flying away, which the Lyons caught, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oare in pieces, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king Jesus Christ the
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>meaning of that vision, he told, that that the man was that horrid beast the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> my capitall enemy, not a Pastor, but a Woolfe, that sayes, behold I am set aloft, who dare come to touch me? the Lyons are the <HI>French, English, Sweads, Hollanders, Venetians,</HI> and others that shall pluck down the proud beast, and powre out my wrath upon her and her adherents, and tha it should begin about 1650. and be compleat by 1666. in her sleep she was heard to say; welcome Husband, and laughed heartily and as shee awaked shee said farewell deere Husband, and she drea∣med many thing more which fell out accordingly, being a ver∣tuos child naturally merry</P>
<P>In 1633. she was marryed in <HI>Lesno</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> and most of the Ministers in <HI>Germany</HI> have subscribed to it, for they seriously consulted about it, and sent into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> for assi∣stance and advise, and the result of the conference (which Mr. <HI>Deodate</HI> shewed me at <HI>Geneva</HI>) came to this; in <HI>Christinaes</HI> dreame, they did believe there was a divine light: for first the young Lady was regenerate, and very zealous for the glory of God, so there was a good life in the person dreaming: Secondly, there was a full perswasion of heart that it was from God, and it would prove true: Thirdly, there was a certitude in the event, the party was not deceived, for it proved so, and it was likewise their judgements, that in a time of generall persecution, or some extraordinary eminent danger, God might and did many times speake comfortable things to his people in dreames, as in the late <HI>Bohemian</HI> warres, many <HI>Calvinists</HI> were admonisht in their dreames to goe to places of security, which they attending were safe from the enemy; as the Angell of the Lord appeared to <HI>Io∣seph</HI> in a dreame, and bad him flee with Jesus Christ into <HI>Egypt, Mat.</HI> 2.13. and others that heglected such dreames have after∣wards repented it.</P>
<P>The Lord keep us all that were made partakers of so great a mercy in an humble believing and thankfull posture, that we may spend the remainder of our new lives in the zeale of his service, as those that having their lives prolonged so extraordinarily are ex∣ceedingly obliged more then othhers to walk answerably to so great a mercy.</P>
