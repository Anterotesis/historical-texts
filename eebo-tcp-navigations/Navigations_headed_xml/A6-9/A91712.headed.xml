<HEAD>A Most Humble and Important REMONSTRANCE To The KING OF FRANCE. <HI>Upon the surrendring of the Maritime Ports of Flanders, into the hands of the English.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVE bring unto Your Majesty the resent∣ments of all <HI>France,</HI> or rather those of all the Catholick parts of Europe, which crieth for Justice upon the most Chri∣stian of Kings, for one of the Insupportablest, and most
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>outragious injuries, that haply the Church ever yet re∣ceived since its nativity upon earth. Is it possible that un∣der the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 14. the Altars should be o∣verthrown upon the frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> which his glori∣ous Predecessors, hath semented with their own proper blood in Palestine. Is it possible that the victorious Arms should not be imployed but for to abolish and exter∣minate the Sacraments, which sanctifieth them? Is it pos∣sible that that Sacrifice should be crowned, wherein the blood of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great is Immolated to the fury of a Parricide, by the inhumane banishment of the King of <HI>England,</HI> driven out of the Kingdome by his orders; nay, that the shameful Sacrifice should be crowned by the pro∣phanation of the blood of Jesus Christ it self.</P>
<P>Pardon, great Sir, the importunity of the subject, which constrains us to open our mouths. Those pathetick mo∣tions of a most bitter sorrow, are only incouraged by the Interest of your sacred Person, by the glory of your Crown, and by the zeal which we owe to Religion. That so dilicate tenderness, we have alwayes had towards all that, which carries the sacred name of your Maj. can hardly justifie to posterity, the respectful silence we have kept hitherto (contrary to all the Maximes, which in all times were received in <HI>France</HI>) upon the oppression of your people, upon so much injustice done to the publick and the private, upon the infraction of all the ancient Laws of the Realm; and indeed Sir, our moderation would have chang'd into prevarication and impiety, if our tongues had not followed the motions of our heart, at the aspect of so many eminent places, I mean those abominable Idols, which hath almost obfuscated the light of our Churches, since they raise them upon the ruines of temples, which threatneth us with the cruellest rebellion, that ever crushed a Crown, and the most desperate Heresie, that ever yet attempted the dishonouring of the Church, and Christia∣nisme.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>We doubt not, Sir, but if the providence of God, let this work fall into your hands, they will imploy all the false colours (to render it black and odious to your Royal Judgment) wherewith, interested flattery serves it self in the Courts of great Princes, for to disguise the most important verities. They often condemn under the odi∣ous titles of Libells and Pamphlets the most necessary Re∣monstrances, especially at such times, as they consecrate under the specious pretexts of your Princes service, such actions as are most disadvantagious to his State and Per∣son; and those who formerly took the liberty to represent to their Kings of the first race, the extream prejudice which their Sovereign Authority received by the misgo∣vernment of the Stewards of their Pallaces, were most severely punisht as Rebells, nay, at such times, as those, who were upon the point of disthroning them, were re∣compenced as most faithful and obedient subjects. Sir, be pleased to judg of this piece, according to the nature of the matter its made of. If it be true, that it is a collecti∣on only of detraction, and calumnies (as shall be re∣presented to your Maj.) then suppress it with all the rigor, that Soveraign Authority oweth to the chastisement of presumptuous licentiousness. But if on the contrary, it does only purely and simply discourse of the mistery of ini∣quity, which they keep occult from the eyes of your Maj. and if it be not only true in all its parts, but also very im∣portant to the good of your service, and that of all your Realm, received as an inspiration from heaven, which hav∣ing a regard of the purity of your intentions, setteth be∣fore you the precepts of your duty, by the groanings of your people, rather then by advertisement, which God often sendeth to such Monarchs, as contemneth his Law: We doubt not, Sir, but that your Maj. studies it with all the care possibly you can, and that in the frequent entertain∣ments of piety, which are so usual to your Maj you do not strongly attach your self to the Doctrine of the world, which teaches us, That one is not more obliged
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>to know what his Dutie is, then he is to do, so much as he knoweth of the same: This obligation is indispensible and common to all the world; and certainly Princes ought to make greater reflection upon it then others, being more exposed to the danger of being seduced by the fallacious Sophistry of Casuists, and the artificious intrigues of their Ministers then the common sort of men are.</P>
<P>All Christendome, which admireth the greatness of your Virtues, hath not doubted but that in respect of what past betwixt the Councel of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> of late years, the good inclinations of your Majesty were often forced by the pretended necessity of your State, and your fair twins of light often troubled at the Traiterous artifice of your Ministers.</P>
<P>Sir, one cannot believe that your Majestie hath been ever informed of the miserable Estate of the Qu. of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> your Aunt, who is least even in mendicity, only to please the cruel Assassinate of her Royal Spouse. One could not imagin, Sir, that the blood of the great <HI>Henry,</HI> which gives you your being, could so unnaturally abandon his daughter and her little Infants even at the indigencie of bread, which never fails the most miserable: who can ever perswade himself that your royal Soul could ever have con∣sented to the alienation, or rather proscription of the King of <HI>England,</HI> your Cozen German and your Ally? Is it any thing else, S<SUP>r</SUP>, then the Phlebotomy of your own proper blood which a fortunate Politician draws, as if it were from your veins, to sacrifice it to the Pannick terror of an Usurper? How, Sir, what imagination can figure such a thing as that the Monarch of <HI>France,</HI> Prince of the most warlike and most generous Nation in the Universe, could consent to such baseness, as to make the noblest Crown of the world stoop to the most Capricious Idol that ever yet carryed favour with fortune.</P>
<P>This false Protector of <HI>England</HI> takes a resolution to Consecrate his detestable Tyranny, by the preheminence he would have given his fantastical Government before
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the August Crown of the Lil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, and <HI>France</HI> fails not to obey his orders punctually. Her Pavillion which hath for∣merly triumphed over all the Nations of the world, which made the <HI>Sarasens</HI> tremble, which brought terror into all the Seas, which notwithstanding the rude captivity of <HI>Fran∣cis</HI> the First, had never abated their courage before all the forces of <HI>Spain,</HI> yet this so glorious a Pavillion humbleth it self at the least signal of a Pyrate, which commandeth the Barke of a Tyrant, the murderer of your Uncle.</P>
<P>This Tyrant is not contented with all those marks of honour, which from the first foundation of our Monarchy was not granted to any other but him only; he pretends to more solid ones, he usurps and encroaches upon new <HI>France;</HI> and, as if he had not believed the advantages which he has upon your Crown to be established enough by a conquest, which the weakness of your Minister ren∣ders so easie to him, he strives to hold the honour of your Predecessors; he detracts from their Glory, he abates their Trophies, by renouncing that so Illustrious a right of so glorious a mark of their ancient Victories, of this In∣violable custome which forc't the English to leave their Cannons as an eternal Monument of their defeat in the mouth of the River of <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI></P>
<P>It is, Sir, as if your Minister were of intelligence with him, to avenge the shame of the <HI>Bedfords</HI> and <HI>Talbots,</HI> he forceth you even by the advice of your Council to quit those famous prerogatives, which frameth alwayes neces∣sary reputation to great States, in those Treaties where you gain Nothing, where you lose Much, where you hazard All; where all things are sealed up with the August name of a Brother, which you give to a Souldier who hath no other Throne but the Scaffold, upon which he Massacred the Kindred of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great.</P>
<P>This conduct, Sir, cannot without difficulty find credit in after ages; ours does your Majesty great injustice by its presence; neither is there that man who doth not resent with a great deal of regret, your Majesty being serv'd by
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>such blind and unfaithful Ministers, and that you should be led by the false opticks of a feeble and ignorant Polititian.</P>
<P>There is no body condemns your Majesty; and all the world knoweth, that those temerities and abominations pro∣ceed from a meer stranger, contrary in all points to the ho∣ly intentions of your Maj. being surprized by the same arti∣ficers that hath often deceived the most circumspect Prin∣ces that ever were; being surprized, I say, by the same means, that made <HI>Solomon</HI> the wisest of Kings confess, that flattery and backbiting were the inevitable destruction of Princes; but adds immediately after, that God illu∣minates their hearts at the very instant of their strongest temptations.</P>
<P>Behold, Sir, this is the moment, at which we ought more then ever, implore heaven for that illumination of your heart, since the iniquity of your minister is come to its height, and since the surrendring of the Sea Ports of <HI>Flanders</HI> to the English, can furnish with sufficient mat∣ter the most dangerous and pernicious temptations, that are capable to make trial of the piety of a most Christian King. We doubt not, Sir, but your Maj. hath shed tears of blood, when these precious pledges were given Heresie un∣der your name; neither do we doubt but that to force your inclinations to an action of that nature, they were fain to imploy all the Authority of the body politick, and of a more subtil cunningness, void of all sorts of religion. You have assuredly shak'd and trembled both for the fear and anger, at the first proposition of so fatal a blow given to the Holy Catholick faith; and when you have represented to your self her Altar demolished, her Temples prophaned, her misteries violated, without doubt the blood of S. <HI>Lewis</HI> bestirr'd it self within your entrails at the sight of such spectacles, as would certainly have strucken horrour into the heart of the most obstinate Miscreant. But they over∣came all the difficulties, Sir, by those reasons by which they commonly give the reasons of the State, and because they might have some pretext, not to discover the frailties and
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>ruinous foundation with which they propt them, they al∣ledg such Maximes unto your Maj. as have no kind of rea∣son with that which passeth to day in the world; and I am sure they have not failed to employ all the colours that can cover and disguise an action of this nature. But God, Sir, obligeth your Majesty to mingle them together, and weigh them in the scales of Reason, which can justly ba∣lance this question; and I shall endeavour to expound it to your Maj. with all the candor that the subject I treat of requireth of me; and I hope to make it clearly known to you that the Councel of your Minister upon this point, is and was both insupportable and insustentable by all divine and humane reasons. The most licentious and abandoned The∣ologie, nay, that is most inservient to the maximes of <HI>Ma∣chiavel,</HI> can neither maintain nor justifie the surrendring of the Ports of <HI>Flanders</HI> into the hands of the English, but by the appearance only of a necessity of State, whereby they endeavour to shuffle up this shameful action, which is like to suppress utterly our holy Faith, even in one of the most Catholick Countries in the world, and the most pro∣found and artificialest Polititian that is, cannot defend a Re∣solution that doth so powerfully establish on this side the Sea the most redoubtable and most ancient enemy of our Crown, unless it be by the false colours he might borrow from the imaginary health of your State. There is not that Casuist so prostitute in the world, no nor that Courte∣san upon the earth so far lost, that can justifie this action by any other reasons, then by such as are drawn (at least accor∣ding to their discourse) from the preservation of your King∣dom: and of this point, Sir, which can receive no difficulty, we conclude, That to judg wholsomly of the question now in hand, we are only to consider. Whether it is necessary or no? which we must sound to the bottom, and let your Maj. know. That the compliance they have had upon this occasi∣on with the English, was not only inutile to the good of your service, but also most disadvantageous to your Crown, and that in all the circumstances that can condemn an im∣prudent and blind Resolution.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<P>We doubt not, Sir, but they represent unto your Maj. the great advantage you receive by those succours <HI>England</HI> sende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to your Army, and that to induce your Maj. to follow those suggestions they would have inspired into your heart upon this subject; they do also represent the English with their swords in their hands, standing also up∣on the pretended patrimony of their fathers. They have also made your Maj. apprehend the great danger of the Protectors combining with the Spaniard, and they have certainly so insinuated into your mind as to render this new a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance very plausibly unto you: And all that couldmake the rupture thereof seem offensive to your State. But we are fident, Sir, that they have omitted more then half the considerations they should have made upon this subject, and that they have acted after the manner of them who deceiveth the sight by taking away one half of the day from the objects they would have shown; and that your Minister keeps from your knowledg the most solid, and the most important part of your interest.</P>
<P>We cannot deny, but that your Maj. had a great deal of Reason to wish the falling out betwixt <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> but we maintain you had none at all to buy the Rupture at the price of a publick Scandal, which eclipseth the glo∣ry of your Reign by such unparallell'd baseness, which ob∣scureth the splendor of your Renown, by such tyes as makes you lose your ancient Allies, by such unnecessary conde∣scentions which makes the Protector of <HI>England</HI> Prote∣ctor of the Hugonots in <HI>France,</HI> by the unbridled licen∣tiousness which made them build more then forty Temples since the death of the late King your Father of Sacred Me∣mory; and by the giving up of those places which gives the entry in the nearest places to your Capital City, to the ancientest and mortallest enemie of your State.</P>
<P>Sir, If all the forces of the Empire and <HI>Spain</HI> were tri∣umphing in the midst of your Provinces, if our fields were covered with the multitude of their Legions; if all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> had conspired against the <HI>Lillies,</HI> we should never
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>have look't for any succor from <HI>England,</HI> and if we had, certainly we should have shed tears of blood to be reduced to so great a straight, as to seek for consolation in the in∣fidelity of Rebels, who would never have granted us any, but to our destruction. And we do firmly believe, Sir, that we shall never be brought to such Extremities, as might make our interests depend from the good will of such peo∣ple as have principles so directly opposite to ours. The Divine Providence, which so diffusively spreads its benedi∣ction upon the Piety and Valour of your Majesty, hath ordained far more auspiciously the events of your happy destinie, still Victorious over the indiscreet follies of your Minister, shall more and more mark your dayes with con∣tinual Victories.</P>
<P>But, Sir, Is this to answer those blessings of heaven? Is this to be sensible of the glory of your Reign? Is this to know the advantages of your Victories, to end them with the loss of your Conquests, with the surrendring of <HI>Mar∣dike,</HI> and those other preambles to the Siege of <HI>Dunkirke,</HI> which they forced out of your hands even with terrible me∣nances? You exhaust your Treasures, you ransome your Subjects, you expose all your Nobility, all your Army is endangered every day; they fight against the element, they combat with the Rigour of the season, and all those strug∣glings more then humane, hath no other motive, but the sur∣rendring of the Key of <HI>Flanders</HI> unto a Nation which in two hundred years could not comfort themselves of the loss of that of <HI>France,</HI> in being deprived of <HI>Callais.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, whosoever would had seen that which is done to day upon the Frontire of <HI>France</HI> drawn in a Table, he would certainly have considered it as a Capricious fancie of a Painter, who would have taken pleasure to play with his own imaginations; or rather of a description of a Masque∣rade, where those who enter the Lists do only make their Swords glister for the divertisement of the beholders. If one would have shewn on the one part those vast fields of <HI>Dunkirke</HI> covered with Battalions; and on the other
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>part that little Territory of <HI>Mardike</HI> covered only with fourteen or fifteen hundred men, which looketh upon the motions of the others with their hands hanging loose by their sides; should not one have greater reason to believe that the later were Senators of old <HI>Rome,</HI> who would for their own pleasure and recreation, cause an Army of Gladiators, and slaves to fight before them; than to ima∣gin that this great multitude were composed of free borne∣men, who with all their hearts sacrificeth their lives and fortunes for the conservation and glory of this handful of people? We see the remnant of 4000 men flying up and down the banks or dunes of <HI>Flanders</HI> only for the service of 2 or 3000. Goviats or Crackropes, which <HI>England</HI> sent in this small number. We see them daily continue those sad engines, and projects of this bloody spectacle wherewith they make account to feed the greedy eyes of <HI>Cromwell</HI> towards the beginning of the next Campain; we see that this false Prophet beholdeth from the top of the Tower of <HI>London</HI> all those combats, where all the blood that is spilt whether Spanish or French, is drawn as if it were in a sacrifice, which we our selves do offer to his illusions. And which is more deplorable in these trans∣actions, it seems we are not contented to subject this age wherein we live, to the will of this tyrant, but that we do also affect to enslave our posterity to the English ser∣vitude by surrendring those places so famous and so consi∣derable in the world.</P>
<P>Those places are so considerable, Sir, that <HI>France</HI> could not endure they should remaine in the power of <HI>Spain,</HI> whose Naval forces are well known to be no∣thing dreadful to your Maj. and your Minister is pleased to deliver them unto <HI>England</HI> which is already Mistress of all the Seas; and who doth only consider them as the first step or degree upon which they will hereafter mount up the bastions of <HI>Callis;</HI> if the weakness of your Minister doth not prevent them by opening the
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>gates by virtue of a treaty. But, Sir. We humbly sup∣plicate unto you, that you would be pleased not to receive this which we now offer unto your Maj. as any spight∣ful exaggeration carried on by the wings of malice: It being evident, that there is not so long a way between <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Callis,</HI> as there is between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The Protector who makes the Pavillion of <HI>France</HI> humble it self before him, (which neither the <HI>Henryes</HI> nor the <HI>Edwards</HI> could ever have done) cannot behold with a good eye those places in the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> which the aforesaid Kings of <HI>England</HI> had en∣joyed in your Kingdom, wherein he keepeth by his Intel∣ligence a party which those Kings had not.</P>
<P>And without doubt, Sir, he exasperates daily that Ulcer which knaweth incessantly our own entrails within us; and the interest he assumes in the sylliest creature, that belongeth to those of the reformed R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion, proveth pregnantly, that <HI>Mardike</HI> and <HI>Dunki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> are not the bounds he puts to his designs: God grant. Sir, that when this Daemon of ambition is once established in the main Continent by your Maj. own forces, which gives him more advantages against your self then he could have hop∣ed for, in thirty years of open War against your Crown, That after he hath made parties of his own within your Kingdome, through the connivance or at least the igno∣rance of your Minister, who doth even Idolatrize him; God grant, I say, Sir, that he doth not convert all his forces against <HI>France</HI> it self, which is without contradiction the object, which is most natural and obvious to his desires. God grant, Sir, that those places which we buy for him to day at the price of our blood, of our goods of our Honour, and of our consciences, be not in a short time the Maga∣zins and Arsenals, that shall furnish out the ammunition destined to batter down ours. God grant that those places be not the refuges of those Vessels, which may hereafter block up our Havens. God grant that the influence <HI>Dunkirk</HI> has, does not make it self sensible, even unto our residences.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
<P>Sir. The most infallible Maxime for to judg wholsomly of the actions of men, is to examin their interests, which commonly are the Rules they prescribe to their actions, and the delicatest Politician doth not absolutely reject the con∣jectures which might be drawn from their passions, being often mingled together and running almost insensibly into those powers, which gives motion to the most important affaires.</P>
<P>Those that are perswaded, that, as he had not faln out with the Catholick King, but through rage and choller, which made him arrest all his Ships, and commit such insupporta∣ble Robberies upon the coast of <HI>Spaine,</HI> are also of this o∣pinion, which hath also great deal of likelihood, as well in respect of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as other Politicks; it being very credible, that the Furies wherewith he is agitated, doth of∣ten occupy that place in his spirit, which was destiny'd to the pure lights of reason.</P>
<P>Sir, After what manner soever we manage our Judgment upon this matter, it is impossible for to divide it between the Protectors interests and his passions; and at whatsoever time we consider both the one and the other, we find them in a perfect harmony, to conspire against our greatness: neither can we think the seeming union that is betwixt your Crown and <HI>England</HI> for the present, to be any thing else, but a Captious Truce, which the Interest of the Protector hath violently extorted from his inclinations, hoping to be bet∣ter able to follow them, after that the inveiglement of your Minister shall have done forging, the most dangerous armes that can be employed against your Crown and King∣dome.</P>
<P>It is in this Kingdome, Sir, where besides other States which have but indirect alliances with the House of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that he seeth at every instant the <HI>Manes</HI> or Ghost of <HI>Henry</HI> the great threatnings the Parricide of his Son in Law; it is in this Kingdome that he beholdeth Reigning so gloriously that blood which is confounded and mixt by many straight alliances with that which he had so barba∣rously
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>spilt upon the Scaffold of <HI>White-hall.</HI> It is in this Kingdome that he seeth already form'd in the noble minds of the French, those lightnings and tempests with which they shall hereafter chastise his criminal head, after that the providence of God shall through the loss of your Minister, purifie their generous inclinations, so naturally devoted to Monarchy; the furies which alwayes agitateth Parricides, impoisoneth daily the ulcerated and cankerous soul of this Tyrant, by the fear of the indignation which he cannot escape but in appearance only, by the diffidence he hath in your promises, which he seeth to be forc't from your inclinations by the hatred of your blood which he hath so outragiously injured; he knoweth too well that a Minister, which is capable to put into his hands that, which he durst not pretend unto with all the force of his arms, is a Minister, which nature doth not produce in all times, and in all ages. He cannot expect to find in an al∣teration which might happen (God knows when) in your Councel, those faculties he hath met with in a blind and stupid Minister, whose ignorance he improveth so well that he would willingly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>event those ordinary resoluti∣ons in <HI>France,</HI> which perhaps in time would oppose the most rigorous and most subtil spirits; he would make use of that imbecillity to conquer our Country, which serves him now to deceive it; and all these confiderations joyned together will undoubtedly represent themselves to his mind, and reduce him peradventure to his own natural Genius, which induced him to make war upon us by the space of four years, with insuppor-table Pyracies, without ever daigning to denounce any against us, as if he were minded to adde that disdain, (to which we daily expose our selves) to the other damages which we sustain in the ruin of our commerce, that Genius which though obliged by so solemn a Treatie, yet hinders him not upon all oc∣casions, fromtreating us rather like slaves then allies; that Genius which is so fortified by a particular interest, alwayes inseperable from such avaritions souls as his, nay,
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>by those rapines and outragious Extortions which he can commit every hour in the sight of our Ports, which are so near his and without comparison, more commodious, more considerable and more profitable to him then all the advantages he can derive from the far research of the Fleet of <HI>Spain,</HI> which one may say to be as uncertain as their course is in the vast extension of the Ocean. Those projects which came to nothing in the Indies, but to his own confusion, doth certainly, turn his restless and ambitious imaginations to other parts nearer home, and which are more exposed to his Tyranny. He feeds his soul with those Soaring Ideas of the ancient <HI>Brittans,</HI> which seems not to him so impossible as their examples; and without doubt, when he considers that the first of his Conquests costs him but so little pains he sooths up his ambitious thoughts, which Ferries him over our Seas, and represents unto him one time <HI>Guienne</HI> revolt∣ed under his Standarts. and another time he fancyeth <HI>Normandie</HI> reduced under his Laws.</P>
<P>But we hope, Sir, that God Almighty will limit those vast designs by some extraordinary effect of his mercy upon poor <HI>England,</HI> now Tyrannized and oppressed; and that by a mighty stroke of his Justice, he will no longer suffer this Tyrant to usurp the Lawful Inheri∣tance of that August Prince who is Cousin German to your Maj. and who does so perfectly answer, by his me∣rits, the Proximity of blood that is betwixt your Ma∣jesties.</P>
<P>In that case, Sir, what advantage shall <HI>France</HI> find in the necessity they have reduced the King of <HI>England</HI> to, in Allying himself so straitly with the King of <HI>Spain?</HI> In that case, Sir, may not we with great deal of reason complain of the little forecast of your Minister, who by a very peculiar address against your Interest, should joyn the most redoubtable puissance of the Sea, with the conside∣rablest forces of the Land that is in the world? In that case, Sir, should not we with great deal of judgment ap∣prehend
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>from a Lawful King justly incensed that power which makes us now tremble, being in the hands of an usurper whom we so often oblige, and so observantly re∣spect? In that case, Sir, the same policy which yields up <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the Changeling power of a Tyrant, raised only by the uncertain motions of a blind and capricious for∣tune, shall not refuse <HI>Callais</HI> to the soveraign authority of a Lawful Monarch, when his auspicious destiny shall con∣solidate both his Throne and Glory. Should we not judge, Sir, that as the hand of God is not yet seen over the crimes of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> so do they weaken the weight of these considerations, and according, the ordinary max∣ime of your principal Minister, who is not accused of too much providence, they give no other answer to this kind of reasoning, but that we most conform our selves to the Times, and take new parties according to new Conjun∣ctures. But we must humbly beg of your Maj. to make a more serious reflection upon this State, that this straite and inviolable Alliance hath put all <HI>Europe</HI> in; and we doubt not but without expecting any revolution in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or alteration in <HI>Cromwels</HI> partie, you will easily find out the extreme prejudice which this desperate peace hath done to your Interests.</P>
<P>Can your Majestie perswade it self, that the States of the United Provinces hath not conceived an Extraor∣dinary Jealousie at this near neighbour-hood of the English? Or can your Majesty believe that this Re∣publick, the wisest that is in the Universe, doth not ex∣tremely repine at the surrendring of those Sea-Ports of <HI>Flanders</HI> unto the only Nation of the world, which contend with them for the Empire of the Seas? Hath not your Maj. reason to apprehend, that those faithful places which ac∣knowledged with so much fidelity, valour and wisdom the obligations they have owed unto your Crown, are not now toucht to the very quick, by the participation w<SUP>ch</SUP> you make of the most considerable places of the low Countries, to such people as have scarce yet sheathed the Swords, which
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>but a little before they so injuriously drew against the Hollanders? Can your Maj. doubt but those prudent and Sage Politicks are well inform'd, that the Imbargo of their Vessels, the interruption of their Commerce so advan∣tagious both to <HI>France</HI> and their State, the false complaints of their Embassador and Vice Admiral were only practi∣ses concerted betwixt your Minister and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> for to reduce those brave defenders of their Liberties, to be slaves to the fantastical-Capricio of <HI>England?</HI> Can your Maj. doubt but those interests, so visible and sensible to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> are not powerfully animated by the recognizance which they owe by so many solemn Trea∣ties to the House of <HI>Orange;</HI> and that this recognizance does also wait upon the famous Ghosts of the <HI>Williams,</HI> of the <HI>Fredericks,</HI> and of the <HI>Maurices,</HI> who all conjure your Maj. by those inviolable tyes they have had with your Crown, not to concur to the destruction of that Roy∣all House, which honoured theirs with a Princess of as great Virtue as Birth?</P>
<P>☞ Can your Maj be ignorant of the difference there is betwixt <HI>England</HI> a Republick, and <HI>England</HI> a Monar∣chy; that one may consider Great Brittain under a King, as a very considerable Country in <HI>Europe;</HI> but that it might be lookt upon under a Senate, which assumed such a form, as makes it self Formidable to all the Earth? And that this Consideration makes, That no Prince in Christen∣dome will joyn with your Interest, so long as you contri∣bute to the Establishment of a Republick, which from the very first instant of its birth, embraceth both the one and the other Hemisphere, and, as it were, in a bravery defieth the Universe.</P>
<P>We have reason to suspect, that Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI> had not with so much violence molested the Coasts of <HI>Portu∣gall,</HI> had not <HI>Holland</HI> been disturb'd in her own Frontier Neighbour-hood by the English. We have subject to fear that the attempts under hand which <HI>Cromwell</HI> made upon the Zound, were the true and real motives that made the
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>States and <HI>Denmarke</HI> joyn with <HI>Spain;</HI> we fear that your Maj. loseth all your most faithful and affectionate Allies, who confederate themselves openly by reason of your Mi∣nisters compliance and submission to their sworn E∣nemies and Hereticks, who are prefer'd before the most Ancient, the most Sacred, and the most Inviolable Allian∣ces of you Crown. The Holy See is manifestly injured by those actions, which make Heresie triumph in the midst of her Churches; we put our selves in the sittest condition to receive the just marks of her Indignation upon a mat∣ter of so criminal a Nature, as is able to pour thunder up∣on our heads; we provoke her every day more and more, by such circumstances as are indeed very worthy the Patri∣arch of Franticks.</P>
<P>We lose all our reputation among the Catholick Par∣ty, we purchase none amongst that of the Potestant, whose greatest body abhors the Protectors ridiculous Illusions; and all the fruit of our prostitution is but to confound our selves with the Independents, that is to say, The sworn ene∣mies of all Crowns and Religions.</P>
<P>Cast your eyes, great Prince, upon your true and so∣lid Interest, and discern with that fair light heaven hath given your Majesty, that which is your real service from the imaginary Interest, or rather, the ill understood Policy of your favourite, who by a Monstrous Prodigy, which po∣sterity shall hardly believe of your Maj. hath of that Prince∣ly pre-eminence (hitherto alwayes inviolable) Established upon the Frontiers of your Kingdom a Modern <HI>Attila,</HI> the Paricide of Royaltie; who is so blind as to permit a formidable party to form it self in the middle of your State? Who in the midst of your Triumphs abandons that which wisdom would not permit to foregoe, after the loss of four Battels, and can give no colour to this perni∣cious conduct, but the inconvenience of a War, whose bad success could never be more dangerous then the reme∣dy he hath applyed; I mean, that cursed remedy, or rather that fatal poyson with which he hath broke the <HI>Munster</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>peace so glorious, and so advantagious to your Maj. hath spread so prodigally upon that ardent fewel which consumes all Europe, to the end he might eternize the conflagration thereof.</P>
<P>Here it is, Sir, that we find our selves put on by the pure and holy motions of truth, which opens our mouths, ani∣mates our tongues, and stirs up our hearts to discover to your Maj. the grand mistery of iniquity; that mistery which is drawn from the bottom of hell: this is the mi∣stery whereof the cruel Demon of War hath made <HI>Crom∣well</HI> depofitary, and another man too Sir, which the respect we owe to our Maj. will hardly let us name; we would if we could possibly turn it off from the heads of some of those that have the Honour to come neer the most Chri∣stian of Kings; but alas! Sir, despair hath overcome the tenderness of our desires, one may still suffer with patience that hath some hopes left him, and there is no affliction so great but might be qualified, if one had some hopes, (though never so long to come) to see an end of them.</P>
<P>But, Sir, there can be no such hopes in our misfortune, Europe is now condemned to all eternity to endure Warre and misery; the Sea-Ports of <HI>Flanders</HI> have consumed the fatal negotiation of Munster; and if it be just that the same hand that broke the peace should perpetuate the War; how can <HI>Spain</HI> ever consent to a treaty without Restitution of those places which were wont to supply <HI>Bruxels,</HI> or how can <HI>Cromwell</HI> condescend to a Restitution, which might advance the general peace, the greatest block in the way of his fortune: Who could ever have believed that after 27. years of open War, <HI>France</HI> could be so unhappy as to put the general peace into his hands, who of all men hath the truest interest to break it; we say the truest, Sir, to distinguish his from that of others, who certainly have but an imaginary one in the rupture of it, (but on whom to the great disturbance of the Christian world) ima∣gination hath as much influence in this point as real truth.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>
<P>It is in this place that we find our selves obliged to name more particularly then we have hither to done my L<SUP>d</SUP> Cardi. <HI>Mazarine,</HI> being constrained by our subject to discover to your Maj the true motions that had engaged him to an acti∣on, which one might very well call the sepulture or quick burying of the general peace: Mr. the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who had not timely enough given him the nourishment, that is necessary for a polititian imagined in his infancy; that the chief quality of an able man was never to do any good, and to that this natural inelination of his own he adds some Lecture of <HI>Machiavel</HI> where he learned this doctrine, that tumult and confusion are two things always favora∣ble to such authorities as do not subsist of themselves; besides all this he got some kind of habitude of Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who was naturally of an unquiet spirit, and in all these different Schools, he acquired certain general Maxims of Policy, and having neither well expounded them, nor understood them according to their geniuine sense, he dresses himself so disorderly in an apparel that was never made for him, and in this confusion frameth an extravagant Idea, which perswades him that to be a great Minister he must mar all, never make peace, but turn the world upside down; his Essayes would have out-gone the Master piece of another, since 'twas no less then the rupture of the great and glorious peace of Munster, which cer∣tainly would have been more advantagious to your Maj. then 30. years of War crowned with continual Victories; but as Card. <HI>Mazarin</HI> carryed himself in this transaction, in a manner that was very little disguised, and was very fair from all dissimulation, he soon after perceived the indignation, and displeasure of the people, who ex∣claimed against him with a great deal of rage and fury, for the fault he committed in procuring a Treaty, whose good success was not indeed in his power to obstruct, had he not by a publick Declaration manifested his aver∣sion to the same, and this taught him since, that as an able Merchant will not forget any
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>measure necessary for the weighing of his ware; so does not he omit any thing to further his designs of War, and suppress those that might make for peace. Your Mini∣ster runs with so much precipitation to disturb the publick tranquillity, that his promptitude being joyned with his natural incapacity, doth not permit him to consider what the event might be: He remembers the late Card. <HI>Richlieu</HI> had opposed the Armes of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> by which puissant diversion the House of <HI>Austria</HI> being loaded with the spoils of the Protestant and pust up with <HI>Till ye</HI>'s Vi∣ctories, threatned the designs of the late King your Fa∣ther. Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> who never applies general ex∣amples to particular conjunctures, derives his succour from the North, at such times as <HI>Germany</HI> scarce yet breathing under the burthen of her miseries and sufferings; and forceth this dread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and warlike Nation to put on their Harness, which is to be feared they'l not put off again so soon as could be wished for your services good.</P>
<P>What shall become of this grand State trick, Sir? the Reunion of the King of <HI>Hungary, Poland, Denmark,</HI> the Elector of Saxony, and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> together with the perpetual continuation of the Emperour in the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which one King of <HI>Swedeland</HI> puissantly arm'd upon their frontiers, would have ballanc'd for a long time, and the uniform consent of the Germans (as it was to be suppos'd) at the combusti∣on they would have made in their Country; Charity teacheth us not to ascr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be all this to the ill intentions of Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> but leave something to be imputed to the little light he hath to discern the times.</P>
<P>But we cannot, unless we grant that if he had not fore∣seen the unhappy events of his own enterprizes, he com∣forts himself when he considers it hath given some advan∣tage to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which doth nothing please him, yet hath it in respect of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neral peace produced main obstructions which are infimtely pleasing to him; we have the same thoughts of his conduct in <HI>Italy</HI> where
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>we plainly see he hath animated <HI>Monsr de Modena,</HI> which discontents by such unconscionable practises, as do now exhaust the purest blood and silver in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>What shall become of those samous projects, the pos∣session of those places where they raise as many sieges, as they lay before others; the aversion of all neighbouring Princes estranged from us by the jealousie they have of so unequal a treaty made with the Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> and exasperated by <HI>Monsr. de Mantua</HI> now siding with your enemies: The loss of <HI>Gazal</HI> which brings so much ad∣vantage to <HI>Spain,</HI> as they durst never pretend unto, if your Minister had not withall possible care, indeavoured to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the affairs of your Maj. (by a continual confusion) in such a condition as is odious to all <HI>Italy;</HI> the acquisition of <HI>Montfenr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> to the House of <HI>Austria</HI> which formerly raised all Christendom against it, is notwithstanding now received as a mostipleasing news to all Princes.</P>
<P>We believe that <HI>Monsr.</HI> the Cardinal had not altoge∣ther foreseen the fair effects of his own pollicy; but we are perswaded the extream sorrow he conceived at the ill success of one of his designs, to wit, <HI>Monsr. de Mo∣dona</HI>'s triumph, is much mitigated by the satisfaction he finds in those obstacles which his confusions, (though not answering the expectation of his project) hath occasioned to the General peace. And that which lets us see we are not deceived in this point, is, that as soon as he perceived those ill successes which frustrated his hope, diminish in some sort, the strength of those obstacle; which his ma∣lice imployed against there-union of the two Crowns; he embraces with unspeakable eagerness his fatal meanes of their disunion, forlever he precipitates with such impetuo∣sity to the surrendring the Maritime Ports of <HI>Flanders,</HI> that is to say, an action so manifestly prejudicial to your Maj. service, that one can never suspect his ignorance to have any share in this Treachery, but that we must impute it intirely to his malice, which would have given this mor∣tal wound to the common prace of Christendome.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>
<P>One cannot, Sir, impute this shameful resolution to any other cause but to his inveterate malice, which made us fight under the Banners of the Protector of <HI>England,</HI> and which hath now forced us to end that field which had cost us such immense sums of money, only to make a chain that might enslave us to this Tyrant.</P>
<P>It is now, Sir, more then 27 years, that I do not know what slight, and almost frivilous interest, had made all the earth shake and tremble by such an impetuous moti∣on, as (if we had believed your Minister) all the men of the world could not resist; and yet in the very first year of your unhappy Alliance with <HI>England,</HI> they deliver to <HI>Cromwell</HI> (more likely as a Homage, then by vertue of a Treaty) a Country far more considerable then all the places that had been the occasion of the breach between the two Crowns. Thus we buy an Everlasting War at a price at which one might have been ashamed to purchase the most necessary peace.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> had formerly (even by the acknowledgment of your minister) preferred the continuation of the miseries of all <HI>Europe,</HI> before it would have left the fortifications of <HI>Nancy</HI> in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> nay, we have proffered to run the hazard of all immaginable revolutions (which are too contingent to great enterpri∣zes) rather then leave one good place to a Petty Prince, even worn out by the process of his own misfortunes. And we do now a dayes abandon such Ports as are, with∣out contradiction, more important to a Commonwealth, which is far more redoubtable then the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> yet, with this difference, that in the restitution of <HI>Nan∣cy</HI> we might have found peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> and in the surrendring of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> we have found War with all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>What disorder, Sir, or what confusion hath not your Minister brought to all the Nations of the world, by this fatal action? the hopes of Consolation, which alwayes accompanies and qualifies the greatest misfortunes, is now
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>taken away from us. His cruelty in revenging the de∣testation the <HI>French</HI> have of his government, and conduct of your Person, is not satisfied with a misfortune, which, together with other Nations, is common to them; but he endeavours to stifle in us, as much as he can, the liberty of desiring, which dispair it self could never utter∣ly extinguish in us. He disturbs the most sacred and in∣violable of our holy Vows, and by a monstrous Prodig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which Nature yet could never parallel, we find our selves (even at this instant) in an incapacity of discharging the most essential of all our obligations.</P>
<P>In how sad a condition, Sir, doth a French Catholick find himself in the Churches? and at the foot of the Al∣tars must he implore the blessings of God upon the Ar∣mies of <HI>Spain,</HI> declared enemies of your Majesty; or must he seek the favours of heaven upon those of <HI>France,</HI> which a horrid and terrible blindness imployes for the E∣stablishing of Heresie. Which shall we behold more willingly, the Cross of <HI>Burgundy</HI> displayed on the top of our Bastions, or that of <HI>England</HI> (which doth so crimi∣nally degenerate from it self) triumphing upon Catho∣lick Rampiers? Which shall we fooner desire, Sir, the loss of our own Colours consecrated to Almighty God in the Churches of <HI>Bruxells,</HI> or the Standarts of Castile, dedicated to Divils in the Temples of <HI>London?</HI> What shall we wish for the ruine of your Armies animated by our own proper blood, before the Towns of <HI>Flanders,</HI> or the conquest of those places which is, without com∣parison, more prejudicial then their conservation? We feel in our selves, Sir, we feel in our hearts a Combate of Religion against the State, and of the State against it self: Shall we run next Summer to the Siege of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> then to that of <HI>Ostend,</HI> so to <HI>Newport,</HI> and all this to follow our Natural inclinations to obey our Prince? Or shall we stay at home, and implore the protection of God upon those places, which serve as much, at least, in the hands of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that they give the weakness of your Mi∣nister
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>some means to satisfie <HI>Cromwells</HI> ambition for a year; by some other way then the giving up of <HI>Call is</HI> and <HI>Bullin?</HI> shall we in the Winter prepare branches of <HI>Lawrell</HI> to Crown the sacred head of our Prince the next spring or shall we draw into a solittude, to bewail a misfortune that makes them wither as soon as they are gathered?</P>
<P>In how doleful Estate, Sir, and in how deplorable con∣dition doth poor <HI>France</HI> find it self? at this very instant it seems she doth delight to spoil her self of all those glori∣ous advantages, she had obtained over <HI>England</HI> in Ages past? it doth not suffice her now to efface the lustre of her ancient Victories by this servile and dependant War, which she make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under those Standarts, which she hath formerly with so much glory rent to pieces, but she must yet for the satisfaction of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> renounce the reputation she had acquired in the negotiations, and Treaties, they reckon, Sir, 600. years between the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> and that of <HI>England,</HI> since the unfortunate marriageof <HI>Al∣cenor</HI> of <HI>Guienne</HI> and those who make up this number, mark very judiciously that the English who were never-yet weary of contesting the glory of Arms with our Nation, were forc'd to yerld to them at least in points of Wisdome and Policy.</P>
<P>But alas! Sir, this advantagious opinion which we could never cherish with two much care in the hearts of all peo∣ple, is now Ravished and buried in this last fatal Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> now we make <HI>England</HI> amends for all the for∣row we caus'd her in former times, in defending our selves so wisely from all her subtleties, &amp; surprizes; the sole nego∣tiation of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> shall sufficiently revenge her to posterity of all those advantages we have gain'd upon her in more then 600 Treaties, and <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s fierceness, Victorious over the imbecillity of your Minister shall here∣after quite extinguish the glory of our ancient politicians: Open your eyes then Great King upon this fatal blindness, upon this horrible illusion, which rather obscures then stops those glorious exploits, which all Christendome exnects from your Royal Virtues.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>
<P>Open your eyes, great Prince, upon the loss of your Allies, which they drive ever with violence out of your interests, by the despair they are daily driven to by the ap∣prehensions they have that your Minister will never put an end to the miseries of <HI>Europe.</HI> Open your eyes, great Prince, upon this mortal wound they have given to the general peace, which is the only object of the groans and tears of your people, which is assuredly the final end of your desires, and shall be the work of your Piety and Wis∣dom, if God be Exorable to the Prayers and wishes of all your most Faithful Subjects.</P>
