<HEAD>The valiant <HI>RESOLVTION</HI> OF The <HI>Sea-men</HI> Listed under the command of the Earl of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> who upon Mun∣day last most valiantly beate and slew a great number of Prince <HI>Rubert</HI> his Fortes who were comming to take <HI>Sion-house.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Pon Satterday last being the 12 of <HI>November</HI> Prince <HI>Rubert,</HI> who before, had lay scouting up and downe with his For∣ces, taking advantage of the misty Morn∣ing, advaunced his Eorces, and came toward <HI>Branford,</HI> the suddennes of whose comming was such, that the Inhabitants of the said Town were insensible of his comming
<PB REF="3"/>neither had they the least inteligence of his Approch, by resaon whereof he found but small opposition, vntill the Lord Ro∣berts who did not lye far off came with with his men. At the approch of the Lord Roberts with his men, Prince Rupert had allmost gotten the Bridg, but was stayed by him, so that without the losse of any of his men he got in to the Towne.</P>
<P>And planted himselfe and his men upon the Edge of the Hils, and a bout twelf or one of the clocke in the after none who began to play afresh vpon the Lord Roberts and his Forces, but their orduance did little or no execution which caused a great discontent in the Cavaleirs and made them swere that the Divill was in the powder there Bulets in their great cannon did not fly halfe way of there intended purpose so that before, that before they could reach the mark they aimed that their power and vigor was spent.</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Rubert</HI> had played thus
<PB REF="3"/>some certain time but to small purpose our men who all this while had bin almost idle, the greatest part of their amunition being behind, were now encoraged with new suply of men and amunition, and al∣though they before had sustained som smal losse, yet they were not thereby dismaide, but made good afterwards for that they had suffered before now Colonell Hampden and Collonell Hollis came in with theire forces and with them greate store of Am∣munition, of which before there was great nede on the Parliaments side.</P>
<P>And now being so well provided for the Enimy, they went brauely on, and with undanted sperit played with their great pieces vpon the Enemy, which peaces did brave execution and service that in a small space there fell of the Cavaleirs avery geat number, but of the Parliaments side very few.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>The Cavaleirs perceiving their losse to be so great, and the losse on the <HI>Parliaments</HI> side to be so small, upon Sunday Night at bout eleaven or twelve of the clocke did quit that place, and Prince <HI>Rubert</HI> with all his forces fell backe to <HI>Kingflon;</HI> which Towne by the treachery of the inhabitants was delivered up unto the Cavaleirs, and the townsmen have since pulled up the Bridge; so that all passage for pursuite af∣ter them is hindred.</P>
<P>And I cannot here passe by the inhuman and most barbarous actions of the Cava∣leirs at their entrance into <HI>Acton,</HI> amongst the rest one example being of a most bar∣barous nature, will render their conditi∣ons odious unto you. When they entred the town first of all, and were seated therein, some of the Cavaleirs went up and downe to plunder where they had intelligence a∣ny store of money, Plate, or jewels of va∣lue were; amongst the rest it happened that they came unto one Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> his house, but he not being then who is a <HI>Brewer</HI> in
<PB REF="4"/>the Towne of <HI>Acton,</HI> they comming to this Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> his house, did demaund the Mr. of the house, but he not being then within would not be content with that answer but fell to pillaging; Mistris <HI>Peircy</HI> the <HI>Brewers</HI> wife, having not bin delivered of a child above one weeke before, was very much affrighted at the vnruly carriage of the Cavaliers, and although she was weake yet thinking by faire perswasions and pro∣mises to appease them for the present came down and desired them that they would desist from such uncivill actions and that they should have what they could desire, or the house could supply them withall.</P>
<P>These her faire speeches gave them but little or noe satisfaction but the more she intreated the more violent were they in the persecution of their violent misdeme∣nours, shee perswads but they were still as death as adders, and at the last one of them more cruell then the others, as she was standing by weeping did cock his pistoll, and shot her with her child in
<PB REF="5"/>her little babe in her Armes, such an act of barbarous cruelty <HI>I</HI> thinke scarce any Chrouicle can parralell such unhumane acts.</P>
<P>Upon Munday, after the Cavaliers had lost <HI>Brainford,</HI> and sheltred themselves in <HI>Kingston,</HI> after some time, some of them came over the water againe and tooke <HI>Sion-house,</HI> thinking by this meanes to stop all provision from comming unto the City, but they were much deceived, for the <HI>Sea∣men</HI> who had listed themselves under the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> tooke two small Pinisses mand with fourteene peeces of Ordnance, and with them gave many a brave shot a∣gainst the house, but could doe but little good by reason of the strength of the buil∣ding could do small execution.</P>
<P>Vpon which they were constrained to draw away their ships, for want of the tide to carry them backe and likwise constrayned to sinke them least the Ca∣valiers should seize one the Ordnance, and by this meanes they have defeated the expectation of the Cavaliers.</P>
