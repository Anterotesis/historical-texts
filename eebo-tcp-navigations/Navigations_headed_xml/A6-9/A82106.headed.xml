<HEAD>NEW PROPOSITIONS FROM THE NAVY TO The Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and the Army; concerning the Kings Majesty, and the Impeached Members of Parliament, now under restraint and power of the sword.</HEAD>
<P>VVHen we beheld the glorious splendor of Justice and Righteousness, beaming forth it self in your Remonstrance to the House of Commons, we were filled with joy and satisfaction, that the divine presence had again overshadowed you, and appe∣red thereby to us with smiles of love, and pledges of favour, when with the night of ruine we were almost overwhelmed
<PB N="1" REF="3"/>For which, as we kisse the footstool of that glorious Maje∣sty who thus rarely brings forth our deliverance; so wee cheerfully confesse you to be his glorious Instrument, wher∣by he hath stilled the enemy and the avenger. For, 1. Wee must seriously professe, that though your former procee∣dings against that Generation were exceedingly prospered, beyond the parallell of former ages, and had engraven upon them the kindnesse of God to a distressed people; yet they had but served to make us more exquisitly miserable, if your former Conquests should have acquiesced in the acti∣ons of that House; who were bringing your conquered pri∣soner with honour and safety to sit upon his Throne of po∣wer, Majesty, and Greatnesse, without satisfaction for the bloud that hath been spilt both by Sea and Land, or suffici∣ent provision made for the security of the liberties of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 We were filled with sorrow when we saw the abomi∣nable Apostacy, and degenerated actings of the majority of the House of Commons, who after we had bought their se∣curity with our most precious bloud and treasure, should by treating with the King, so cruelly sell us into the bloud and revenge of him, and his confederats, so contrary to their first principles and Declarations; the consideration where∣of, as it filled us with amazement, so it drew from us there∣of a mutual Remonstrance, to live and dy, and stand and fall with your Excellency, for the establishing of peace and righteousnesse, in our native, bleeding, and languishing King∣dome.</P>
<P><HI>A Declaration of the Prince of</HI> Wales.</P>
<P>THe Prince of Wales, with his Councel, hath had some consultation touching the affairs of <HI>England,</HI> and the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent state and condition of the King, and are resolved to
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>make ready the Fleet, to put to Sea, having taken an oath &amp; protestation, to hazard life and fortune for the rescuing of his Royall Father (the King) from the power of the Army. Most of the Brasse Guns that were in the revolted ships are taken out and sold, all but such as were fit for the field, and put iron ones in their roome, which ships are to be com∣manded by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Prince is to return to his Mo∣ther, the Duke goes to a University, this Fleet of ships are to go first for <HI>Garnsey, Garsey,</HI> and <HI>Silly,</HI> and settle those Islands, then to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to settle the Marq. of <HI>Ormond,</HI> for reducing that Kingdome to the obedience of his Majesty, and then comes an Army over into Wales, and so for England, That such prizes as shall be taken, or other kind of Marchandi∣zing Trade given, Agents are dispersed to the severall Prin∣ces and States of Christendom, for freedom, as formerly with his Majesty of <HI>England.</HI> This Message is said to be sent from the Prince to the aforesaid kingdoms.</P>
<P>For augmentation of this Fleet, and to make it more for∣midable against the English, all undone, deeayed, and discon∣tented Gentlemen, are invited to joyn and provide ships, which is in part done, divers being gone out of the West parts already to <HI>Silly</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>There goes with Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> 1000. Souldiers, besides Saylors, also very many Gentlemen or Reformadoes, whose purses are emptied in <HI>Holland:</HI> the Inhabitants of the Island of Garnsey its said, must be moulded into Regiments, and employed by Sea or Land, as being like to prove more ad∣vantageous then there livelyhood here: besides, other nota∣ble designs on foot, for the raising of new Forces against the English Army.</P>

<P>HIs, Highnesse the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> having received severall informations &amp; complaints from the Eng∣lish Marchants, of their great losses which they have lately sustaind at Sea by a pretended Fleet for the <HI>King</HI> under the conduct of Sir <HI>William Mucknell,</HI> who (with a with a Squadron of Irish ships (consisting of about 11 in number) lies hovering up and down the narrow Seas, seizing on divers Marchants ships, and others, to the great retarding and obstructing of the Trade and Commerce at Sea. In consideration whereof, his Highnesse forthwith called a Councel, aboard the Reformation, and after some consulta∣tion, came to these results, and resolved.</P>
<P>That a Message should be forthwith sent to the Mar∣chants of <HI>London,</HI> and others, purporting, That his Highnesse would take a speedy course, for prevention of future inju∣ries, and that he had sent an expresse command to the said Vice Admirall <HI>Mucknell,</HI> to desist from acting any thing whatsoever, that may rend to the obstructing or hindering of Commerce at Sea, protesting, That he is so far from har∣boring the least thought of violence or oppression, either to the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> or any other of his Majesties liege people of <HI>England,</HI> that he would rather sacrifice his life then be guilty of the least action of tyranny. And therefore desires that these his resentments may be communicated to the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> and all others whom it may con∣cern; to the end, that traffique and commerce both by Sea and Land may be maintained and preserved throughout all his Majesties Realms and Dominions.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all their faire preretices whatsoever, none are more active and inveterate against the peace of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>than those who are in highest es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em with the Prince, Divers forces are raising in several parts of these Provinces, another Army in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and great provision making for War; but what their Design is, we cannot as yet discover, but it is supposed for <HI>England.</HI></P>
