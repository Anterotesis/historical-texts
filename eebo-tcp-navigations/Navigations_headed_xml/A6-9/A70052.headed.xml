<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
OF THE
French Publisher.</HEAD>
<P>THO the surprising Adventures
of Mr. <HI>Sadeur,</HI> and the <HI>Dis∣covery</HI>
of the Country of which
you are going to read the parti∣culars,
be things very <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> yet
'tis supposed, the Reader will not much
scruple to believe them, when he shall be
informed, that a <HI>Southern unknown
Land</HI> has been talkt of these 200 Years▪
He will only wonder, that since the world
is now so well furnished with numbers of
such skillful and curious Travellers, how it
should have continued so long <HI>undiscover'd,</HI>
and he will judge not without sufficient
Grounds, that they which have attempted
<PB REF="3"/>
this discovery, have either been <HI>Lost in
their Voyage,</HI> or been Killed by the In∣habitants
of the Country, after they had
entred it; as <HI>Sadeur</HI> had been himself, had
it not been for the signal he gave of a prodi∣gious
Bravery and Courage, before the eyes
of the <HI>Australians,</HI> by fighting against ani∣mals
of a monstrous strength and bigness;
which so charmed those people, who are na∣turally
very brave themselves, that they
granted him the priviledge to live among
them, contrary to the most solemn Laws of
their Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Birth of Sadeur,</HI> and his Education,
his Misfortunes and <HI>Shipwracks,</HI> will ap∣pear
to all the World, as effects of a Desti∣ny,
that designed him to be born for no o∣ther
purpose, but to be conducted afterward
into that <HI>unknown Country,</HI> of which we
had no <HI>true Relation</HI> before his time.</P>
<P>It is true, that <HI>Magellan</HI> attributed to
himself the honour of having discovered this
Country, in the year 1520, under the name
of <HI>Terra de Fugo,</HI> or the <HI>Land of Five.</HI>
But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have clearly convinced
us, that he discovered certain Islands that
depend rather upon <HI>America,</HI> than <HI>Au∣stralia.
Mark Paul</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> has like∣wise
enjoyed for a considerable time the
<HI>Glory of this Discovery,</HI> because that
<PB REF="3"/>
being driven by a Tempest, a great way be∣yond
the Island of <HI>Java,</HI> he discovered the
Kingdom of <HI>Maletur,</HI> the Province of
<HI>Beach,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Petau;</HI> and another
Isle, which he named, the <HI>Lesser Java:</HI>
But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> which have since set∣tled
themselves in the <HI>Greater Java;</HI> and
who drive all the Commerce there, assure us
by all their <HI>Relations,</HI> that all the Coun∣tries
that Pilot saw, are nothing but a great
cluster of many Islands, that no where joyn
to the <HI>Southern Continent:</HI> and that is so
much the more probable, because <HI>Ferdinan∣do
Galego,</HI> having Roved all about that
Great Sea, from the Strait of <HI>Magellan,</HI>
to the Molucca Islands, reports that it is
stowed with such a multitude of Islands,
that he counted above a thousand.</P>
<P>It is likewise true, that upon comparing
the Description that <HI>Ferdinando de Quir</HI>
a <HI>Portugal,</HI> gives of the <HI>Southern Conti∣nent,</HI>
with that which is contained in this
Book, it must needs be allowed, that he
hath made some Discovery of that Country.
For we read in his eighth <HI>Request</HI> to the
<HI>King of Spain,</HI> that in the Discoveries,
which he made in the year 1610, of the
Southern Country, called here <HI>Australia,</HI>
he found a Country much more Fertile and
Populous than any in <HI>Europe;</HI> that the in∣habitants
<PB REF="4"/>
were much Biger and Taller than
the <HI>Europeans;</HI> and that they lived much
longer than they. And <HI>Lewis Paes de
Morres,</HI> who was Admiral of the Fleet of
the said <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> confirmed to the
Councel of <HI>Spain,</HI> the truth of <HI>Doaduir's</HI>
Relation, adding that the Air was so heal∣thy
in that Country, and so conformable to
the Temper of Man, that people there, as
freely slept by <HI>Moon-light,</HI> as by Day-light,
on the bare Earth, and that not only
without any incommodity, but with pleasure;
That the Fruits there were so excellent and
nourishing, that the inhabitants sought no
other food; that they drank a much more
pleastant Liquor than Wine, that they knew
not the use of Cloaths; and that the study
of <HI>Natural Knowledge,</HI> was there very
much Cultivated. But notwithstanding all
that, we must needs grant on the other hand,
that they had but a very superficial know∣ledge
of that Country, and that what they
have said of it, might serve indeed to
stir up the Curiosity that many had al∣ready
to know it, but could no way satisfie
the Appetite it had raised in them, with
any solid and particular Account.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore to our <HI>Sadeur,</HI> whose Re∣lation
here follows, that we are wholly obliged
for the Discovery of this before <HI>Unknown</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>Country.</HI> And I doubt not but many per∣sons
will be surprized, that the name of a
man to whom the World is so much behold∣ing,
should lye so long concealed in obscuri∣ty,
as well as the particulars of his <HI>Rare
Discovery:</HI> But their surprize will undoub∣tedly
cease, when they shall know that the
<HI>Memoirs</HI> from which this Relation was
composed, were long <HI>kept private in the
Cabinet of a Late Great Minister of
State,</HI> from whence they could not be had
<HI>till after his Death.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Birth and Education of <HI>Sadeur:</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS 'tis impossible to reflect upon
all the <HI>adventures</HI> of my Life,
without admiring the prodigi∣ous
variety of Events which
have accompanied it, so I believed I
ought to make a Collection, and from
thence remark all the most considerable
Instances, for altho I have yet no oppor∣tunities
to send them into my <HI>own Coun∣trey,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
nor see any probability of return∣ing
thither, yet I believe I cannot do
better than commit them to writing, for
the frequent assistance of my Memory,
and my more particular Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I receiv'd a Memoir from a Father Je∣suit
of <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> when I was at
<HI>Villa Franca,</HI> which contains an Account
of my Birth, and the <HI>Adventures of my
younger Years,</HI> as I am about to relate.</P>
<P>My Father was called <HI>James Sadeur,</HI>
and my Mother, <HI>Willemetta Ilin,</HI> both
of them were of <HI>Chatillon</HI> upon <HI>Bar</HI> of
the jurisdiction of <HI>Rochel</HI> in <HI>Campagne,</HI>
a Province of <HI>France.</HI> My Father knew
many Secrets in Mathematicks, which
were owing more to his own Genius
than the Precepts of a Master; particu∣larly
he excelled in the inventions of fa∣cilitating
the removal of great Bodies or
Burthens. <HI>Monsieur de Vare,</HI> who had
then some Intendance over Sea Affairs
being acquainted with him, brought him
to <HI>Bordeaux,</HI> and from thence to the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> with promises which he ne∣ver
perform'd to him, altho he knew
him to be so necessary for his Service:
My Mother who had followed him, prest
him to return after 9 or 10 Months a∣boed
at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and being imbark't,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HI>April 25. 1603.</HI> she brought me into the
World 15 days after they had been on
Shipboard, <HI>Monsieur de Sarre,</HI> who was
Captain of the Vessel, was pleased to be
my God-father; <HI>I was Conceived in</HI> Ame∣rica
<HI>and brought forth upon the Ocean,</HI> an
infallible presage of the miseries which
were to attend me during my whole
Life.</P>
<P>The Voyage was happy enough in all
the places which were esteemed dange∣rous,
even to the Coasts of <HI>Aquitain,</HI>
where an unexpected Tempest so furi∣ously
engaged the Vessel, that it was
cast upon the Coasts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Ship∣wreckt
near the Cape of <HI>Finisterre,</HI> in the
Province of <HI>Galicia</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> with the
loss of my Father and Mother. The <HI>same
Memoir,</HI> says, that my Mother seeing the
Ship let in the Water on every side,
lifted me out of my Cradle, and em∣bracing
me with an extream tenderness,
and abundance of Tears, said, <HI>Ah my
dear Child, have I brought thee forth upon
the Waters, to see thee so soon swallowed
up by them? at least I shall have this con∣solation
of perishing with thee.</HI> She had
hardly finish'd this complaint, when a
more impetuous Wave than any of the
former, breaking into the Vessel, bore
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
her away from my Father. In this ex∣tremity
every one was sensible that no∣thing
was more dear than the preserva∣tion
of his own Life, only my Parents,
who preferring me to themselves, did
expose themselves to the evident danger
of perishing to preserve me alive; the
love that my Mother had for me, made
her not forsake me, for in the lifting
me up continually with her arms above
the Waters she her self was at last choak-with
them; the Courage which my Fa∣ther
shewed on this occasion was also
very particular, for, forgetting him∣self,
instead of making to the Shore as
did the rest, he came to us by the <HI>Mer∣cy
of the Waves,</HI> and imbracing my
Mother, who yet lift me up, he drew us
just to the Bankside, and set us upon
the Sand, but either having wholly
spent himself upon this occasion, or be∣lieving
that we were Dead, he fell down
in a Swound, holding me in his Arms;
altho every one was sufficiently perplext,
yet there was none that did not consider
this spectacle, and was not amazed at it,
many themselves running to relieve us,
when it was perceived that I had yet
any motion, they took me from the
Arms of my Father, and held me be∣fore
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
a fire, which the Inhabitants had
kindled out of compassion to us. There
was no sign of life in my Mother, and
having laid her for some time before the
fire, they were perswaded that she had
more need of a Burial.</P>
<P>Those who had more particularly
known my Father, deplored his fate
with Cries that drew Tears from the In∣habitants
of the Countrey, <HI>O Man of
eternal memory,</HI> said some, <HI>O too generous
soul, must thou dye for being willing to save
the life of thy Family? Ah,</HI> said others,
<HI>never was there such a Tragedy; the
Mother to expose her self for the Child,
the Father for the Mother, and yet those
generous efforts to terminate in the death
of each other.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether so much lamen∣tation
made my Father sensible, but he
open'd his Eyes, and with a feeble and
languishing voice, said, <HI>Where art thou
my Dear?</HI> this unexpected speech surpri∣zed
the Company, and when they an∣swered
him not readily enough, he ad∣ded,
<HI>Then let us all three dye together;</HI>
these were his last words, and then he
clos'd his eyes and dyed. 'Tis said▪
that he signalized himself on many oc∣casions
in this Voyage; but he drew the
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
admiration of every one in this extre∣mity:
All those who saw him thus ex∣pire
could not look upon me without be∣ing
moved with pitty, <HI>Poor destitute</HI>
(said they) <HI>what can become of thee, can
any good fortune attend thee in this world,
thou being the cause of their death, who
gave thee thy life?</HI> Some believed that
I could not long survive them, after the
violent struglings which I had under∣gone
in the Shipwrick.</P>
<P>But alas! this was but the begin∣ning
of a Tragedy, which I have now
continued for about fifty five Years, with
so great and strange Catastiophes, that
they can never be represented in their
whole extent, altho I my self should re∣late
them all: the heat of the fire soon
impower'd me to weep and lament,
with such a noise as gave them to un∣derstand
that I was out of danger.</P>
<P>An Inhabitant of the Countrey, who
knew French enough to understand
what had past, remembred that he had
an only Son who dyed not long before,
and resembled me, this mov'd him to
use his interest to get me; they repre∣sented
to <HI>Monsieur de Sacre</HI> that this was
a very favourable opportunity, and
that he could not easily refuse it without
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
putting me in evident danger, he there∣upon
consented, being rather constrain'd
by necessity than any other conside∣ration;
this man soon adapted me into
the place of his Son, and his Wife ha∣ving,
heard the whole relation embrac'd
and entertain'd me with great Caresses:
Monsieur <HI>de Sarre,</HI> and some others of the
most skilful in the Vessel, knowing that
they were near to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, took a
resolution of visiting the Church which
is consecrated to God, under the name
of this Saint, and there by good fortune
they found Merchants of their own ac∣quaintance,
who equip'd and gave them
opportunity of returning creditably to
<HI>Oleron. Monsieur de Sarre</HI> after his ar∣rival,
began to particularize his adven∣tures
to his Wife, and describe the Ship∣wreck
which he had escap'd, but it was
some time before she could attend to it,
for the joy of having received her
Husband safe from the danger of so
long and tedious a Voyage; this wholly
took her thoughts in the first moments
of his return: But some time after she
prayed her Husband to give her the
<HI>History of the Shipwreck,</HI> and then she
could not forbear admiring the Conju∣gal
and paternal Love of my Parents,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
who for my sake underwent a volunta∣ry
death; and instead of conceiving an
indignation for me, she took such an
affection to me, especially when she
understood that her Husband was my
Godfather, that she continually impor∣tuned
him to find some means of re∣gaining
me; whereupon he re-imbarkt
22 Months after his return, and in 15
days arrived at <HI>Camarinas,</HI> where he
found me very well, and about 30
Months old, equally cherish'd by a Fa∣ther
and Mother, whom I believed to
be my Parents; as soon as he had de∣clared
to them the reasons of his coming,
and the design he had to pay for my
entertainment, proportionable to the
time that they had kept me, these good
People were mightily offended, and de∣termined
not to part from me; <HI>Monsieur
de Sarre</HI> alledged his <HI>right of Godfather,</HI>
and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> insisted upon the Do∣nation
and Possession, this Cause was
brought before the Judges of <HI>Camarinas,</HI>
who, having decided in favour of my
Foster Parents, <HI>Monsieur de Sarre,</HI> for
fear of having made a Voyage to his
shame resolv'd to steal me away, and
fly under favour of the Wind which then
stood for him, and entring roughly into
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
the house with a Valet where I was, and
seeing only one Servant-Maid which
held me, he snatcht me into his arms,
and gain'd the Bark which was ready
to Sail; the fear that I was in, and the
Cries that I uttered threw me into a
kind of Convulsive Swound; as soon as
I came to my self, they found me in a
great Fevor: My foster Father being
advertized, and justly provokt with
this attempt, ran with other people
towards the Forts, and perceiving
that we were out of attack, they made
a discharge, which gave occasion to a
<HI>Portugueze</HI> Vessel who lay to the South,
to discharge a volly of Canon upon us,
with such misfortune that a Bullet broke
a Plank out of our Vessel, just at the
top of the water, and sunk her down to
rights, tho not without some respect of
being the cause of the death of persons
they knew not; those in the Road see∣ing
this accident made what haste they
could away, and the <HI>Portugueze</HI> sent
two Shalops to endeavour to save those
which perished, they only preserv'd a
Valet, who knew how to swim better
than the rest, and as I floated upon the
Waters, by means of the Straw in my
Cradle, it happened that I was also ta∣ken
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
up: I am troubled to write
that which no body can read with∣out
looking upon me as a <HI>kind of Viper,</HI>
which lived by the death of those who
took pains to preserve my life; the
<HI>Portuguzes</HI> fearing a just reproof for
their Crime, put out speedily to the
main Sea, and finding that I was yet
alive, they committed me to the care
of a <HI>Portuguze Matron,</HI> who was in their
Vessel▪ she profest a great desire of ser∣ving
me, till she found that I was of two
<HI>Sexes,</HI> I would say an <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI>
for afterward she conceiv'd such an a∣version
for me, that it was a trouble
to her to look upon me, and as my
Fevor encreas'd, my death had been
inevitable without the particular care of
<HI>Monsieur de Sarre</HI>'s Valet. One might
believe that God only preserv'd him to
cherish me, if I had been any way useful to
his service. Being arrived at <HI>Leira,</HI> he
brought me from Port to Port, and
us'd me with that tenderness, as if I had
been his own Child; the <HI>Portugueze</HI> be∣ing
very willing to be discharg'd of us
for many reasons, departed thence, un∣known
to him; and he being inform'd
that he would find more assistance in
the great Hospital of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> than in <HI>Leira,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
resolv'd to carry me thither: He was
received there with as much humanity
as if he had been in his own Countrey,
but he was scarce arrived when he found
himself seized with a mortal Fevor,
which carry'd him the seventh day, dying
in the arms of a Jesuit, to whom he
communicated all the particulars which
I have related, and as I learn'd by means
of a Memoir which this Jesuite <HI>gave
me 15 years</HI> after as I said before. The
poor wretch dying, instead of regretting
his misfortune, and hating me as the cause
of it, ceast not to recommend me to
those who assisted him, as if I had be∣longed
to him. The Father Jesuits be∣ing
advertized of the Evils which I had
been the cause of till then, very seriously
deliberated what I should come to, and
the result was, that they should take a
particular Cognizance of my Inclinations,
so that they might know how to distin∣guish
my Sex; I had hardly attained
to the age 5 years, but they were satis∣fied
that I ought to be reckoned in the
<HI>Masouline Party.</HI> They saw that I had
an inclination to Devotion, and judged
that if my mind was cultivated, it
would promise no mean thing; they
presented me to the Countess of <HI>Villa</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HI>Franca,</HI> at eight years of age, after ha∣ving
given her the Story of my <HI>sad ad∣ventures.</HI>
This Lady, who might justly
be compared to her Illustrious Predeces∣sors,
received me with so much tender∣ness
that she was pleased that <HI>I</HI> should
be treated and educated as the Count her
Son, who was about 9 years old; altho
I wore a Livery, I had no other obliga∣tion
than that of keeping him compa∣ny
in his Studies, and I learn'd with
him the <HI>Latin, Greek, French</HI> and <HI>Ita∣lian
Tongues;</HI> the Principles of Astro∣nomy,
Geography, Philosophy, and
the History of <HI>Spain,</HI> with Chronology.
The Countess, who shewed the same
affections to me as if I had been of her
own blood, being inform'd that I was
very serviceable to the progress of the
Count in his Studies, was willing that
I should lay by the Livery, and Study
Philosophy, and having accomplisht
that, 'twas thought fit to dispose the
Count to the publick Theses, at the Uni∣versity
of <HI>Conimbria,</HI> where I was ob∣lig'd
to harrangue, and begin the Dispute.
Above 15 days before our departure, I
had my mind so agitated, that I <HI>visibly
dryed away,</HI> so that my blood congealed,
as if I had been about to endure the
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
utmost punishment, and my heart beat
as if I had been upon the point of be∣ing
Precipitated; they saw my Colour
come and go, but that which was most
afflicting in this Chain of accidents, was,
that every body believed that 'twas
only caus'd by the fear of which I had
of appearing in Publick. I shall say no∣thing
of the <HI>Dreams, Spectres,</HI> and a
thousand such things which threatened me
with extream Desolation: So soon as I
had learnt that the Count was resolv'd to
go by Sea, all the story of my misfor∣tunes
which had happened there before;
pierc'd my mind after so feeling a manner,
that I believed there was no mean be∣twixt
embarking and perishing, I en∣treated
then that I might travel by Land
with part of his Train, <HI>But how little
do precautions serve to combat against
Destiny?</HI> That what I sought most
eagerly to shun, the Evil wherewith I
was threatned did justly render it ine∣vitable;
<HI>I made so many adieus</HI> for
some hours before my departure, that
I appeared ridiculous, and the Countess
seeing me weep at her Feet, lookt up∣on
me as Weak and Effeminate. The
Count, with whom I was familiar
as with my Brother, said to me, <HI>Sa∣deur,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<HI>are you willing to forsake us? You
will go distracted, why do you thus torment
your self? I believe that you have some
particular design in your mind; the fear
of appearing in publick is not capable of
working so much upon you as to deprive
you of common sense. My Lord</HI> (said I)
<HI>If it please God that I return, I will
discover to you the weakness of my mind,
but grant me the favour of suspending
your judgment till we come back:</HI> This
answer was so great a surprise to the
young Lord, that he protested that ei∣ther
he would not forsake me, or
that I should not go the Voyage, <HI>For
the Voyage,</HI> answered I, <HI>as it is for your
Honour, so I will accomplish it or dye by
the way, to accompany you upon the water
if my Life lay only at the Stake I should
abandon it with pleasure, but to suffer
that yours should be expos'd, I should
rather do violence on my self than obey
you.</HI> This discourse joyned to the affecti∣on
which he had for me, made him
urge it no more to me, and so we part∣ed.
The day following, it is to be re∣membred
that <HI>Philip</HI> the II. King of <HI>Ca∣stile,</HI>
having taken possession of the
Kingdom of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the year 1581,
he raised many Families to maintain
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
this Illustrious Conquest with the greater
ease, one of these which he most ad∣vanced
was the Seignory of <HI>Villa Franca,</HI>
not without the jealousie of many o∣thers,
who lookt upon themselves to be
deserving as that. <HI>As 'tis more easie to us
Conquer Nations than Hearts,</HI> many
<HI>Portugueze</HI> remained so firm to the Fa∣mily
of <HI>Braggance,</HI> that they only sought
how they might shake off the Yoke of
the <HI>Castilians,</HI> and Crown the Duke of this
House: Altho the Country was en∣tirely
submitted to the Obedience of the
Kings of <HI>Spain;</HI> the secret Revolts of
particular persons were very frequent,
and the Sea was not without its Pyrats,
who shewed in all the Rancounters,
what aversion they had for the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Government, and that they could not
support the Creatures of the King of
<HI>Spain.</HI> The Embarking of the Count
was blaz'd abroad, which was on the
<HI>15th</HI> day of <HI>May,</HI> in the Year 1623.
and two Vessels Confederate of <HI>Braggance,</HI>
were resolved to take him; to this end
they attackt two Sail which convoy'd him
towards the Coasts of <HI>Ternais.</HI> But they
maintained their shock with such vigour
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
that the attack was to their own Confu∣sion,
and the Glory of the Count; I
followed afar off with the Train that
went by Land, and perceived nothing
of what past, till such time as the Ene∣mies
distinguishing us by the shining
Colours of the Count, put to Shore 30
Musquetters, who fir'd upon us from an
Ambuscade, killing one Page, two Ser∣vants,
and the Horse upon which I was
mounted.</P>
<P>The rest being incapable of defending
themselves fled away, and left me a∣lone,
abandon'd to the discretion of these
Pyrats, who having brought me into
their Vessels, put forth into the open
Sea.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Voyage of <HI>Sadeur</HI> to the King∣dom
of <HI>Congo.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS a true saying, that <HI>Man purposes,
but God disposes:</HI> I believed that in
going by Land, I should shun the dangers
of the Sea; and the Sea (if I may so speak)
found me upon the Land, and reduc'd
me to all those misfortunes which I
strove to flee from, the Pyrats were not
long in the open Sea, but that it began
to blow terribly, and became so tempe∣stuous
that the Master Pilots despaired
of escaping; the Mast of our <HI>Vessel broke,
the Rudder split,</HI> the Ship Leakt on all
sides, and we endured 24 hours the mer∣cy
of the Waves, labouring Night and
Day at 6 great Pumps; till at last being
overcome with labour, the water at
last gain'd upon us, the Ship sunk down
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
to the Bottom, I found my self by chance
near the Door of the Captains Chamber,
which was born up and began to swim,
and as I was about to perish I catcht
hold of it, rather by a natural Power
and Instinct, than by any effect of Rea∣son
and Conduct: I cannot say how
long time I floated with in it that manner,
because I was distracted and void of
Judgment; but I was perceived by
means of the Moon-light, by a Vessel,
which sait'd towards the <HI>South,</HI> and
which sent out a Shalop to know what
I was, when they saw that I was a Ship∣wreckt
man, they took me and carryed
me into the Vessel: I was scarce come to
my self, but they took me for a <HI>Portu∣gueze,</HI>
and soon remembred that they
had seen me at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and that I was in
the service of the House of <HI>Villa Franca;</HI>
the Captain of the Vessel order'd that
particular care should be taken of my
person, because he had great obligations
to that Illustrious House, I was not long
in recovering my perfect health, which
so soon as I got, I conjured the Com∣pany
to dischage me at any rate what∣ever,
I recited all the misfortunes
which had happened to me upon the
water, and omitted nothing which
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
might perswade them that this Element
was extremely fatal to me, but the
more I studied reasons to work 'em in∣to
that belief, the more ridiculous I ap∣peared
to them, wherefore I concluded
with my self to insist no longer upon that
Subject, but that it were better for me to
abandon my self to the <HI>Course of my De∣stiny.</HI>
The Captain told me that the re∣spect
he had for, and knowledge he
had of that House, where he had of∣ten
seen me, obliged him to conduct
me thither, that he might deliver me
to the Countess, adding, that he esteem'd
this occurrance more happy than all the
other fortunes he could have made in
his Voyage; I learn'd at the same time
that the Vessels which we were in be∣longed
to the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Merchants,
which went to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> It hap∣pen'd
a little time after that, the chief
Secretary of the Vessel fell very ill,
wherefore they pray'd me to undertake
the charge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wind</HI> was so favourable that eve∣ry
one said I brought <HI>good luck to the
Vessel.</HI> We came well and healthful to
the <HI>Line,</HI> the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and the first
of <HI>September</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Congo,</HI>
where we cast Anchor the sixth, at
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
<HI>Maninga:</HI> There was no sickness a∣mongst
us, but that of the Secretary,
which encreas'd daily; the Physitian gave
his opinion that he ought to be set a
Shore, all the Captains and Pilots at the
same time judg'd, that he ought not to be
exposed to double the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI>
during the approaches of the Equinox.
At last it was resolv'd to stay in this Port
till the Month of <HI>December,</HI> as well for
our Health as to avoid danger: We met
three <HI>Portugueze</HI> at <HI>Maninga,</HI> who un∣derstood
the Language of the Countrey,
and who told us of so many <HI>Rarities in
the Kingdom,</HI> that we could not suffici∣ently
admire them: <HI>and was a true terestial
Paradice,</HI> filled with all that man could
ever desire, for Health, Convenience, or
the Pleasures of Life, without any need of
cultivating the Earth, which is often bar∣ren
after a thousand labours, and always
exposed to the rigours of bad seasons.</P>
<P>The natural inclination which I al∣ways
had to know the <HI>wonders of Nature</HI>
gave me a very <HI>sensible pleasure</HI> at the
relation of them, and as I sometimes
desired of our Merchants to go abroad
into the Country, and examin the truth
of these things which were told us, so
I shall give this Abridgement of them
as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="15"/>
This Country has not half the Inha∣bitants
in it that <HI>Portugal</HI> has; I know
not whether it may happen from the lit∣tle
Inclination, and the great difficulty
there is to engender: The Men there are
entirely <HI>naked,</HI> only within these few
years, there are some that begin to imi∣tate
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and cover what we
call <HI>Shameful.</HI> 'Tis certain, that the a∣bundance
of their Countrey renders them
negligent, slothful, simple and stupid;
after having considered them sometimes,
I was forced to acknowledge, that Man
naturally becomes slothful when he has
nothing to do, and that Idleness trans∣forms
him to a Beast. The Soil of these
Regions, which is watered throughout
with the Rivers of <HI>Zair</HI> and <HI>Cariza,</HI>
produces Fruits in Abundance, without
any Labour, and these Fruits are so <HI>deli∣cate
and nourishing</HI> that they fully satisfie
those which eat of them, even the very
Water of certain Fountains, has I know
not what delicacy and juice, which satis∣fies
those that drink thereof. We staid
there a considerable time, but without
any expense, because the People despise
Gain, the Countrey furnishing in abun∣dance
all that one can wish. There's so
little need of Houses in this Countrey,
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
that no body goes into them; and as the
Nights have all the sweetness that one
can desire; so 'tis better to sleep abroad
than under a covering; they know not
how to make use of Beds, yet they have
their Reserves of some Mattresses, for
the weaker sort to lye upon, tho there is
no body that sleeps not upon the Ground,
All these Considerations gave me an Idea
of a People, who being not obliged to
Labour, lived with some justice in the
midst of Idleness, which rendred them
dull, negligent, sleeping, disdainful,
without Exercise, and without Action.</P>
<P>Our Captain gave Liberty to me, and
three more of our Company, to go by
the River <HI>Zair,</HI> to a <HI>Lake</HI> of the same
Name; we had all the Pleasure and Sa∣tisfaction
possible in this Voyage. Take
one part of the most considerable Re∣marks
which I then made, as far as my
Memory will assist me. We arrived in
twenty four days at the mouth of the
<HI>Lake,</HI> we went about it in ten, and we
came back again to the Fleet in twenty
more; the River <HI>Zair</HI> is not rapid, and as
we had four good Oars, we could easily
make fifteen and eighteen Leagues a day;
nevertheless, 'tis certain we never made
above eight in going, whence we may ea∣sily
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
see how much our Geographers are
deceived, that place the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Zair</HI>
three hundred Leagues from the Sea,
that which obliged us to such little Jour∣neys,
was the number of Curiosities
which continually presented themselves
to our Eyes, in Fruits, Flowers, Fishes,
and tame Animals; we could scarce re∣mark
a place in the vast Meadows of six∣ty
and eighty Leagues long, which was
not enriched with a <HI>Marvellous Tapestry of
Flowers,</HI> which would pass for rare in
the finest Cardens in <HI>Europe;</HI> I could
scarce see my Feet tread upon so many
Miracles of Nature without Indignation;
but the vast quantity of them was the
cause that they were no more esteemed
then our Field Dazies; there is scarce a
Tree which does not bear some precious
Fruits, and such as are incomparably bet∣ter
than all that we know; and Nature
hath so accommodated them to the Con∣stitution
of the Inhabitants, that they
might be gathered without incommodety
and danger; we lived not upon any o∣ther
Nourishment, nor did we desire any
more: Our Master Pilot <HI>Sebastiano Deles,</HI>
a Man of great Experience, seeing that
we were admiring why we should go to
the <HI>East-Indies</HI> for their Delicates and Cu∣riosities,
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
and never brought back none
of those things that we saw in this Coun∣trey,
said, That 'twas with these Fruits,
as with Viands, well baked and seasoned,
which could not be preserved four days
with their ordinary Gust; this obliged me
to make the Experiment, and I saw that
indeed they would not be kept long with∣out
Corruption; 'tis true, that in eating
them we find 'em perfectly digesting,
nourishing and conformable to the Sto∣mach,
very different from our Fruit, and
which brings at last as much Indisposition
to the Body, as Pleasure to the Taste.</P>
<P>For this Cause they may be preserved,
since their Crudity strives with their na∣tural
heat, whereas those at <HI>Manicongo</HI> be∣ing
perfectly ripe are spoiled in a little time,
and as nature has provided that some are
always dying; so the Trees are always
laden with Flowers, Buds, and Fruits,
some green, some rotten, and others pro∣per
to Eat.</P>
<P>Amongst the great <HI>quantity of Fishes</HI>
which I remarkt in the River <HI>Zair,</HI> I saw
two sorts which surprized me, I may call
the one Amphibious, since they are some∣thing
like our Water Spaniels, and come
as easily out of the Water; they leap
almost like Foxes, with this difference,
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
that their Paws are as large as the Feet of
our Drakes, and those before are twice or
thrice as short as those behind; they have
so great an Inclination for a Man that
they will seek him out, and offer them
selves to him, as so much Sacrifice, it
happens sometimes that they will even
leap into Boats, and come to the Feet of
the Watermen, to fawn upon them like
Dogs; this I saw with my Eyes, and I
wish not over well to a Water man that
struck one of 'em down at my Feet; the
Natives of the Countrey call them <HI>Cad∣zeick,</HI>
and their Flesh resembles that of
our <HI>Spanish</HI> Otters.</P>
<P>The other that I admired were <HI>slying
F<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes,</HI> and we might well call them Sea
Peacocks, but much more fine, and of a
brighter Colour, than those at Land, 'tis
rarely that they swim at the bottom of
the Water, but they are almost always
seen at the top, their Feathers appear just
like the Scales of Fishes, but with a di∣versity
of Green, Blew, Yellow▪ and
speckled with Red, which ravishes the
Eyes of such as behold them, these which
I saw out of the Water appeared like
great Eagles with two Wings, every one
with five or six Feet; one would believe
that they affected to be seen and admired,

<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
sometimes did they gather together in
a Circle round the Boat, sometimes they
placed themselves right against those who
lookt upon them, turning and returning
after all manners, with Trains which
dazelled our Eyes; The Shores were full
of many sorts of Animals, but the most
common, and the most charming, re∣sembled
our Sheep at <HI>Leira,</HI> excepting
that we saw some of almost all Colours,
I mean, <HI>Red, Green, Yellow, and a Blew
so shining,</HI> that our Purple, and best pre∣pared
Silks come not near them; I askt
why no one traffickt in such <HI>glistering ra∣rities?</HI>
and 'twas answered that these Na∣tural
Colours fail with the Lives of the
Animals.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the <HI>Lake,</HI> we employ∣ed
ten days in going round it, and we
found its length about sixty Leagues, and
its breadth about forty; we saw the head
of the <HI>River Niger,</HI> which is pretty spa∣cious,
and deep enough to carry a Ves∣sel,
but it soon lost it self in the Moun∣tains
of <HI>Benin;</HI> we rested our selves up∣on
the <HI>Nile,</HI> which is not at all inferiour
in its rise to the <HI>Niger,</HI> and it continues
in its first state for about three Leagues,
there is no difficulty to go down into the
<HI>Mediteranean</HI> Sea, and the Communica∣tion
<PB N="27" REF="19"/>
betwixt the two Seas is also very
Commondious by means of this place.</P>
<P>I carefully endeavoured to inform my
self where the Crocodiles were, which
Historians place in such great Numbers
in these Quarters, but the Inhabitants
could not even divine what I talkt of,
which made me believe they were only
Fables, if we may truly say, that those
who make long Voyages may enlarge
upon them to others, who only know
the place of their Birth, 'tis yet more
true to Assertion, that this liberty is
stretcht too far, and often runs out into
Fictions, the reason is, it often happens
that Men travail a great way without
seeing any thing besides Ports, or never
rest themselves a Moment, and all the
Mischievous incommodities which they
saffer, give so much trouble and weari∣ress,
that they never think of taking any
Recreation: Nevertheless, as Travel∣lers
are perswaded that they ought to
tell something new when they come from
far, the more cunning they are, the
more capable they are of Invention, and
as there is no on which cannot contra∣dict
them, they are pleasantly received,
and there is as certain a debt to the labour
of their Inventions, as to truth it self.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="20"/>
We went afterwards into a small
Island which is in the middle of the
Lake which belongs to the King of <HI>Jassal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI>
who also calls himself the King of
the Lake; the Natives of this Country,
call him <HI>Zassa,</HI> and the King keeps a
Fortress, which is lookt upon as very
famous in this Country, tho in truth
'tis very small in comparison of our
Forts in Europe; we were Charmed as
soon as we set foot upon Land, for
there was nothing wanting for the ge∣neral
pleasure of all the Senses, besides
the order of the Aromatick Herbs,
which was a little too strong; there were
Fruits so fine so delicate, and in so great
quantities, that the Beauty of them
joyned to the abundance, cloyed us; but
which was more surprizing than the
rest, and which I had never heard of,
was a Fountain which was as sweet as
our Hipocras, and which rejoyced and
pleased us more than our Spanish Wine,
we reasoned loing enough upon the
cause, which should produce so agreea∣ble
a Liquor, and we concluded that
as all over head was embalmed in this
Country, so the Earth within must be
of the same Nature; and if there were
Fountains of a very ill tast, there must
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>
by consequence be those that are very
sweet and agreeable; we drank with an
inexpressible pleasure, and every one
wisht to live in that place: There came
one of the Natives to us, and with a
great concern told us, that drinking of
that water was mortal to all such as
drank to excess of it, we were n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
long in proving the truth of what he
had told us: But so great a drowsiness
fell upon us, that we could not forbear
lying down in the place, where we
slept above 15 hours, how ever this
sleep had no ill effect upon us, for we
rose as brisk and healthful as we were
before; some attributed this sleep to
the great quantity of Odours which
hanged over our heads, and others be∣lieved
this, that this delicious drink we
had taken, was the cause of it. From this
Isle we were willing to go to the Source
of the River <HI>Cuama,</HI> which we found
narrow and incapable of receiving a
Boat, a little time after, we discove∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
the Fountain of the Lake it self,
and we reckoned above 200 Brooks which
came down from the Mountain, which
are over against the middle of it, and
which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call Mountains of
the Moon, because that <HI>Vasco de Gama,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="21"/>
who first doubled <HI>the Cape of Good Hope,</HI>
in the Year 1497, to discover the
Oriental Isles, seeing the Moon,
on these Mountains, appear, as if it
had toucht the top of them, gave them
this name. The Natives of this Coun∣try,
call them the Mountains of the <HI>Ors,</HI>
that is, of the Water, because of the
abundance of Water which continually
runs down from them. These who
confound the Lake of <HI>Zembre,</HI> with that
of <HI>Zair,</HI> speak upon very defective re∣lations,
for we were assured that it was
on the other side these Mountains, a∣bout▪
50. Leagues from <HI>Zair.</HI> Most
Historians place a great number of
Monsters in these Quartecs, but upon
no other foundation than the recital of
those who first invented it: all our en∣quiries
could not serve us to discover
the Original of a neighbouring Nati∣on,
which the Europians call <HI>Caffres,</HI>
and the Natives, the Country of <HI>Fordi.</HI>
We were informed that a Native ha∣ving
taken a small She <HI>Tigres,</HI> became so
familiar with the Beast, that he loved her
Carnally, and committed that infamous
Crime with her, whence came an Ani∣mal
half Man and half Beast, which
gave the original to these Savages,
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
which cannot be humanized; a very
probable proof of this relation, is that
their Heads and Feet are very like
those of Tigers, and even their Body
is in some places markt with spots like
those of these Animals.</P>
<P>We returned by the River of <HI>Cari<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>
and staid 20 days upon the Road, with
the same divertisements which we had
upon the River <HI>Zair,</HI> except that
whatever we saw as we came back, was
become common to us and excited a less
admiration than at first.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Accidents which brought <HI>Sa∣deur</HI>

<P>SO soon as we were returned we set
sail, with a Wind and Sea as fa∣vourable
as we could wish them, we
arrived in 8 days to the <HI>Cape of Good
Hope,</HI> where we would not stay for
fear of losing the opportunity of so
fair a season, which is very rare in
this place, we were got within sight
of Port <HI>Dananbolo,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Mada∣cascar,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
where we were wind bound, for
more than forty six hours, afterwards
an East Wind so furiously tost the Sea,
and drove us with that impetuosity
that it broke our Cordage, and drove
us above a thousand Leagues to the West.
Many saw some Isles on the right hand,
and took them for those which are cal∣led
the <HI>Trinity,</HI> 'twas there that a Rock
at the top of the water broke our Ves∣sel
into two parts, and where we
found our selves exposed to the mer∣cy
of the most inexorable of all the
Elements. I could never tell what be∣came
of the other Ships, nor what was
the fortune of my Companions in this
wreck, because 'twas in the night, and
very dark; for I was only busied how
to save my self: my other Shipwrack
had given me Experience and Faith, I
had sought for a light Plauck during the
dangers of the Tempest; and I will
say it to my shame, that being far enough
removed from the approaches of death,
I always appeared very indifferent as
to my Life, but in this evident danger,
I could think of nothing else but how
to save my self. I floated for many
hours by the means of my Plank, with
such a tossing and turning over and o∣ver,
<PB N="33" REF="22"/>
that I can't now think of it with∣out
horror: The Waves did so often
plunge me under, and overturn me, that
tho I held out as long as I could, yet at
last I lost both knowledge and think∣ing,
and truly I knew not what be∣came
of me, nor by what means I was
preserved from death; I only remem∣ber
that coming to my self I opened
my eyes, and found a calm Sea, I per∣ceived
an Isle very near, and I felt my
hands so clencht to the Plank, that I
could hardly loose them, and my sin∣gers
were so crooked that I could not
by any means bring them to themselves▪
the sight of this Island encouraged me
very much, and infine, being come on
shore, I drag'd my self under a Tree,
without thinking of any thing but lan∣guishing,
and expecting death in a little
time; I found under this Tree two
fruits, about the bigness, and like in
Colour to our Pomegranets, with this
difference, that their tast appeared to me
much more delicate, substantial and
nourishing; having eaten the first, my
spirits recovered, and my heat grew
light, and having eaten the second I
sound my self sufficiently satisfied, but
I was so bruised▪ that I was in great pain
<PB N="34" REF="23"/>
to bear my self up, so I lay down and
fell into so deep a sleep, that I was at
least 24 hours before I awakt, after this
sleep I found that I was not in the least
a weary, I saw that my Cloaths were
dry, and the Sun shone, and inspired
me with a courage and hope: I found
two other fruits, which I did eat, and
having applyed my self to find out the
Elevation of the Sun, I judged that I
was 33 deg. Lat. South, but I knew
not the Longitude; having rested my
self again I resolved to advance into the
Isle, to discover if there were any In∣habitants,
I plainly saw the appearance
of some ways, but they led into very
thick Bushes, where I could not pass
without stooping, which gave me very
strange thoughts; having found a tree
much higher than the rest, I thought
that if I climbed to the top of it, I
might discover some place or other,
but as I got up I heard a great noise,
and I saw two prodigious flying Beasts,
which came to the top of the tree,
obliged me to get down a little faster
than I got up: Be not surprized at the
name of Beast, which I here gave to the
Birds, for they were so very large that I
was frighted at them, and speak then
<PB N="35" REF="23"/>
as I thought. I got down with all the
speed imaginable, but I was no sooner
down, but heard so frightful a Cry,
that I expected every moment to be
devoured: In fine, coming to my self,
I reflected upon the misery I saw my
self reduc'd to, I concluded that it were
better to dye forthwith, than to seek
to languish any longer, after all, I said,
there's a necessity that I dye by some
means or other, and I cannot shun one
danger, but run into a greater.</P>
<P>I then made a resolute preparation for
death, and remembring that my Father
and Mother expir'd upon the Sea shore,
I made thither, where I had left my
Plank: I had scarce left my place but I
was followed by a great number of Ani∣mals,
which I could not distinguish
from one another, nevertheless I had
my judgment as ready as could possi∣bly
be expected upon such an occasion,
I thought I saw certain kinds of Horses,
but with pointed Heads, and claw-footed,
I can't tell whether these were not of
those Beasts, which came to light upon
the tree where I was, but they had
Wings and Feathers. I saw certain kinds
of great Dogs, and many other sorts
of Animals, which don't at all resemble
<PB N="36" REF="24"/>
any that we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> they made
great Crys so soon as they perceiv'd me,
and as they approacht nearer and near∣er
they redoubled the Noise. I resol∣ved
to defend my life, and took my
Plank and began to exercise it, in turn∣ing
and returning it, which made 'em
very attentive, till two of the largest
Beasts approacht to come in with me,
I turned to one of them, and struck
it so roughly that it ran back to the
other Animals, which set 'em all on
howling: I was seized with an extreme
fear, at the redoubling of these terri∣ble
cries, and in great hast took three
fruits of the Tree which I have spoken
of, and cast my self into the Wa∣ter
with my Plank; after having
swam such a distance as it was reasona∣ble
enough for me to believe I was out
of all danger: I turned my eyes to∣ward
the Isle, and I saw upon the shoar
all that great number of Animals which
I fled from, part of them put themselves
readily to swim, and pursued me with
that vigour and hast, that they were
not long before they came up to me,
when I saw that I could not escape, I
turned towards them, and presented the
end of my Plank to them, with success
<PB N="37" REF="24"/>
happy enough, for as they prest on to
take and bite the end, they made me
advance as fast as themselves, this ma∣nagement
continued till I arrived at a
small kind of a little Isle, which floated
upon the Water; and which carried
me away, swift enough to remove the
means of my Enemies joyning me: they
followed me nevertheless with a Cou∣rage,
or rather with an encreased Rage,
till they dispaired of being able to come
at me again; but at last my Isle happen∣ing
to stoop on a sudden, they had
time of coming up to me again: I
scarce knew what to think, and began
to make unprofitable reflections in de∣vising
the cause of the Immobility of
the Isle, whose motion had been so favou∣rable
to me, I saw four of those great
flying Animals which I have spoken of,
which came to the assistance of the o∣thers,
when they were ready to fall up∣on
me. I covered my self with my
plank, to avoid their first attacks, which
were so rude that with a stroak with
their Beak, they pierc'd it thro', 'twas
then that my Isle raising it self, sud∣denly
with an extreme impetuosity
shakt me, and threw me more than 50
Paces from it, I believed that it was a
<PB N="38" REF="25"/>
kind of Whale, which Naturalists men∣tion:
For one of these monstrous Birds
placing her self upon its back, thrust
her Talons into its flesh, it lifted it self
up as I thought, above one hundred
Cubits out of the Water, with a noise
as terrible as that of Thunder. This
toss wholly conquer'd my spirits, so
that I knew not what became of me
then, but my crooked fingers were the
cause that I quitted not my Plank; be∣ing
a little come to my self, I saw the
Creature which bounded, and it cast
water out of its Nostrils, with horri∣ble
hissings; and afterwards sunk down
again, clear under the water.</P>
<P>The Birds which pursued me were
retired, so that I found my self alone
in the midst of the water, without
any other assistance than my piece of
Wood, and without any other thought
than that of death, which I well saw
could not be avoided; I was so spent
with the Fatigues which I had under∣gone,
and so incommoded with the
water which I had swallowed down,
that no one would think humanity ca∣pable
of resisting so great Evils in this
Estate, I remembred my fruits and eat
two of them, after which I found it
impossible to avoid sleeping, so that I
<PB N="39" REF="25"/>
was oblig'd to turn me upon my plank,
with my face upwards, to be in some
manner without danger of being
strangled by the waters. I closed my
eyes, and knew not how long I tarried
in this posture, but I wakned at last
by the rays of the Sun, which darted
very bright upon my face; and I found
that I was driven by the Wind <HI>North-East,</HI>
with great swiftness, altho the
Sea was pretty smooth. I thought my
heart and mind in a very calm po∣sture;
and a little after I found my
self very near a Country, whither the
Wind had driven me; my crooked
fingers were so clinched to my plank,
that I had much ado to disentangle
them to get upon shore; my Cloaths
were so heavy with the water which
they had drunk up, that I could scarce
carry them, the tossing of the Sea, and
salt water which I had drank, had so
distemper'd my head, that I found
much ado to endure it; <HI>I</HI> was like a
man, whom the excess of Wine, or
many turnings had made giddy, and
rendred incapable of doing any thing
to the purpose, all that <HI>I</HI> could do was
to trail my plank at a certain distance,
where <HI>I</HI> layed me down and soon fell
a sleep, my sleep in some measure setled
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
my Brain, and dryed my cloaths, which
<HI>I</HI> rub<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to make 'em less incommodious;
<HI>I</HI> remembred <HI>I</HI> had yet one of these
fruits which <HI>I</HI> have spoken of, and ha∣ving
eaten it, <HI>I</HI> perceived that want of
nourishment was the principal cause of
my extreme weakness; <HI>I</HI> then advanced
to seek out something else, and after
having marched about 200 Paces <HI>I</HI>
found many Trees, but <HI>I</HI> perceived no
fruit, which made me fall into a pro∣found
raving, tho <HI>I</HI> forbore not all
the time to march on, and as <HI>I</HI> went,
<HI>I</HI> lookt downwards, and saw two fruits
upon the Earth, which were covered with
leaves, I took 'em as a <HI>present from Heaven,</HI>
and after I had eaten one of them, I per∣ceiv'd
my strength to encrease, which
encouraged me to advance on my way,
and to examine the place where <HI>I</HI> might
be, which <HI>I</HI> found to be about 35 deg.
<HI>South: I</HI> saw many signs which per∣swaded
me that the firm Land was
not far off, the water was very fresh.
The Winds blew South, and <HI>I</HI> remarkt
that they were very much interrup∣ted;
<HI>I</HI> even perceived certain extra∣ordinary
Vapours, in a word, <HI>I</HI> flat∣tered
my self that <HI>I</HI> saw some ap∣pearence
of a Country, and endeavour∣ing
much to get forward, <HI>I</HI> found a
<PB N="41" REF="26"/>
Tree laden with great fruit, whose
branches were bowed, down to the
Earth; the place was all tapistred with
Flowers of divers colours, and perfu∣med
with very agreeable Odours; as
soon as <HI>I</HI> had eaten of this fruit <HI>I</HI>
fell into a great benumness, and <HI>I</HI> was
so affected, that in looking upon all
things about me, <HI>I</HI> could see nothing
distinctly: A little time after <HI>I</HI> heard
many howlings of Beasts, which seemed
to be very near me, and <HI>I</HI> soon per∣ceived
Seven, which were of the big∣ness
and colour of our great Bears,
besides that every Paw appeared as
bigg as their whole Head, they ap∣proacht
me, and retired many times
without touching me, but at last, they
came up all together, on purpose to
devour me, and <HI>I</HI> was all bloody, when
two great Birds of the form of those
which <HI>I</HI> have mentioned above, came
to light upon these Animals, and ob∣liged
them to retire, and to hide them∣selves
in the next Caverns they could
meet with: The Birds persued them,
but catching none of them, they came
back to me, and after having given
me some wounds with their Talons,
one of them seized me between her
<PB N="42" REF="27"/>
two feet, and lifted me up very high
in the Air; The Girdle that <HI>I</HI> had
went many times about me, and sav'd
my life, by keeping me from being
pierced into the Entrails, however <HI>I</HI>
was in continual fear; after a long
way these animals rested themselves
upon a Rock, where that which carried
me set me down, and the other seiz'd
me after the same manner that the
first did. In fine, the pain that they
put me to, became in supportable, and
having cast me into a kind of dispair,
<HI>I</HI> threw my self vigorously upon his
neck, and found strength enough to tear
out his eyes with my Teeth, he fell at
the same time into the water, and ha∣ving
let me go, <HI>I</HI> soon mounted up∣on
his back, his Companion who flew
before, to divide the Air, perceiving
that the other followed not; and ha∣ving
seen us upon the Water, turned
back and fell upon me, with a dreadful
impetuosity, he pitcht upon my shoul∣ders,
and struck such blows at me, as
would have been mortal if they had
hit me. <HI>I</HI> always kept a little Poni∣ard
at my Girdle, which <HI>I</HI> thrust in∣to
his Belly with much ado, for these
Birds are almost impenitrable, as we
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
shall see afterwards, having two great
Scales which environ them, and which
defend 'em, like those of Tortoises;
whilst I fought against this second
Enemy, the first slipt from under my
Thighs, and got from me, which made
me lay hold on one of the Claws of
the last, by which he lift me up ve∣ry
high, and I held fast for fear of
falling, he cry'd terribly, and after
having raised himself pretty high, he
threw himself into the Sea again, and
by the favour of this Element I had
the liberty to cast my self upon his
neck, and so got upon his back: He
howled at the loss of his blood, tumbled
and turned himself after a thousand
ways to shake me off, and constrain me
to leave him.</P>
<P>I thought then of nothing else but of
holding him fast, to hinder the effect
of his effort, because that my Plank
which was my only assistance, being lost,
I saw no mean betwixt quitting him and
perishing: at last he staied upon the
Water without any other motion than
an Ox, whose throat is cut, confessing
by his stilness that I had overcome him,
having then some leisure to take breath
and to think of my Wounds, I could
<PB N="44" REF="28"/>
not distinguish any part in all my body
which was not torn and bloody; my
Cloaths were all rent, not one part es∣caping,
whole, the water of the Sea,
altho 'twas very fresh in that place, yet
was salt enough to cause such pain as
made me lose my Senses. I apprehend∣ed
sometime afterwards, that some
Guards from the Sea saw part of this
Combat, and that four were come in a
little Shalop to see if they could know
who I was, they believed me to be with∣out
Life, and drew me into their Boat
as a dead man, who had expired in his Vi∣ctory:
as soon as they perceiv'd any
motion in my heart, they put into my
Mouth, Nose and Ears a Liquor, which
soon made me open my Eyes, and see
my <HI>Benefactors;</HI> they made me drink of
a sort of Water, which gave me new
strength, and recovered my Spirits;
they washt my Body with an odoriferous
Water, they anointed my Wounds
and bound them up very Commodiously,
having thus brought me out of danger,
they pursued my Enemies, and having
drawn the last into the Boat, they laid
him at my feet, the other had still some
motion; but explaining to them by signs
that I had pluckt out his Eyes, they pur∣sued
<PB N="45" REF="28"/>
him, took him, and laid him upon
the other, with great marks of rejoycing,
they returned to Land, from which they
were distant about three hours rowing,
and having brought me to shoar, they
bore the two Fowls at my feet, with ac∣clamations,
like to those they are used to
make in their greatest Victories.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Discription of the <HI>Australian</HI> World.</HEAD>
<P>IF there was any thing in the World
which could perswade me of the in∣evitable
fatallity of humane things, and
the infalible accomplishments of those
events, the Chain of which composes the
destiny of Mankind, it would certainly
be this History that I am writing; there
is not on single accident of my Life,
which has not been serviceable either
to direct or support me in this new
Country, where it was decreed I should
one day be driven. My often Shipwracks
taught me to bear them; both Sexes
were necessary for me under pain of
being destroyed at my arrival, as I shall
show in the sequel of my Story. It was
<PB N="46" REF="29"/>
my good fortune to be found naked, o∣therwise
I had been known to be a Stran∣ger
in a Land where no one wears any
covering, without that terrible com∣bat
that I was obliged to maintain
against the monstrous Fowls I have be∣fore
mention'd, and which brought me
into great reputation amongst those
that were wittnesses of it, I should have
been forced to have submitted to an
examination, that would have been in∣fallibly
followed with my death. In∣fine,
the more all the Circumstances of
my Voyages and perils shall be conside∣red,
the more clearly it will appear
that there is a certain order of things in
the fate of man, and such a chain of
effects that nothing can prevent, and
which brings us by a thousand imper∣ceptible
turnings, to the end to which
we are destined.</P>
<P>The custom of the Inhabitants of
this Country is never to receive any
person amongst them, whose Humour,
Birth and Country, they know not be∣fore:
But the extraordinary Courge
with which they had seen me fight;
and the great admiration they conceiv'd
at my reviving after it, made me with∣out
any inquest be admitted into the
<PB N="47" REF="29"/>
neighbouring quarter, where every one
came to <HI>Kiss my Hands:</HI> They would
also have carryed me upon their Heads,
the greatest mark of high esteem that
they show to any person; but as they
perceived it could not be without in∣comoding
me, so they omitted this ce∣remony.
My reception being made,
those that had brought and comforted
me, carryed me to the House of the
<HI>Heb,</HI> which signifies, a House of Edu∣cation;
they had provided me a lodg∣ing,
and all things necessary, with such
a diligence, as surpassed the Civility of
the most polished Europeans: I was
scarcely arrived when two Hundred
young <HI>Australians</HI> came and saluted me
in a very friendly manner; the desire
I had to speak to them, made me call to
mind some words that I had heard at
<HI>Congo,</HI> and among others that of <HI>Rim∣len,</HI>
which I made use of, it signifies,
<HI>I am your Servant,</HI> at this word they
believed me to be of their own Coun∣try,
and cryed out with great signs of
joy, <HI>Le cle, le cle,</HI> that is, <HI>our Brother,
our Brother,</HI> and at the same time pre∣sented
me with two fruits of a red
colour, intermixt with blew, I had no
sooner eat them, but they refreshed,
<PB N="48" REF="30"/>
and strengthend me very much; they
gave me afterwards a kind of a yel∣low
bottle of Liquor, that held a∣bout
a good glass, which I drank with
such a pleasure as I had never before
felt: I was in this Country, and a∣mongst
these <HI>New faces, like a man fallen
from the Clouds,</HI> and I found it difficult
to believe I truly saw what I did; I
imagin'd to my self sometimes, that per∣haps
I might be dead, or at least in a
Trance, and when I convinced my self
by many reasons, that I was certainly a∣live,
and in my perfect sences; and yet
I could not perswade my self that I was in
the same Country, or with men of the
same Nature of our Europeans: I was
entirely: cured in fifteen days, and
in five Months learnt enough of the Lan∣guage
to understand others, and to ex∣plain
my self to them. I have here there∣fore
set down the best account of the
<HI>Australian Territories</HI> that I could get ei∣ther
by the relations of others, or cou'd
describe according to the Meridan of
<HI>Ptolemy.</HI></P>
<P>It begins in the three hundred and
fortieth Meridian, towards the fifty se∣cond
degree of Southern Elevation, it
advances on the side of the Line, in
<PB N="49" REF="30"/>
forty Meridians, until it comes to the
fortieth degree. The whole Land is
called <HI>Hust:</HI> The Land continues in this
elevation, about 15 degrees, and they
call it <HI>Hube;</HI> from the fifteenth Meridi∣an
the Sea gains, and sinks by little and
little into twenty five Meridians, until
it comes to the fifty first degree. And
all on the western side is called <HI>Hump:</HI>
The Sea makes a very considerable Gulph
there, which they call <HI>Ilab:</HI> The Earth
afterwards falls back towards the Line,
and in four Meridians advances unto the
two and fortieth degree and a half; and
this Eastern side is called <HI>Hue:</HI> The Earth
continues in this elevation about thirty
six Meridians, which they call <HI>Huod;</HI>
after this long extent of Earth, the Sea
regains, and advances unto the forty-ninth
degree, in three Meridians, and
having made a kind of semicircle in five
Meridians, the Earth returns and goes
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n unto the thirtieth degree, in six Me∣ridians,
and this Western side is called
<HI>Huge.</HI> The bottom of the Gulph <HI>Pug,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the other side <HI>Pur;</HI> the Land con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inues
about 34 Meridians, almost in
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same elevation, and that is call'd the
Land of <HI>Sub,</HI> after which the Sea rises,
and seems to become higher than ordi∣nary,
<PB N="50" REF="31"/>
wholly overflowing the Earth,
and falls again by little and little towards
the Pole, that Earth by degrees giving
way unto the sixtyieth Meridian, on this
side are the Countries of <HI>Hulg, Pulg,</HI>
and <HI>Mulg;</HI> towards the fifty fourth de∣gree
of elevation, appears the mouth
of the River <HI>Sulm,</HI> which makes a very
considerable Gulph: Upon the borders
of this River live a people which are
very like the <HI>Europians,</HI> who are under
the Obedience of many Kings.</P>
<P>This is all that I can have a certain
knowledge of, as to that side of <HI>Australia,</HI>
which is towards the Line; it is limited
towards the Pole, by prodigious Moun∣tains,
much higher and more in accessible
than the <HI>Pirhenean,</HI> which separate <HI>France</HI>
from <HI>Spain;</HI> they call them <HI>Ivas,</HI> and
they begin towards the fiftieth degree,
falling insensibly, for sixty five Meridi∣ans,
unto the sixtieth degree, and then
rising again unto the forty eighth, and
returning afterwards unto the fifty fifth
degree, after which it rises to the forty
third, and then ends in the Sea.</P>
<P>At the foot of these Mountains they
distinguish these following Countrys;
<HI>Curf,</HI> which extends it self from the
Mountains unto <HI>Huff;</HI> afterwards <HI>Curd;</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="31"/>
then <HI>Gurf, Durf, Jurf,</HI> and <HI>Surf,</HI> which
last ends in the Sea. In the middle of
the Countrys, between the Mountains
and the <HI>Australian</HI> Coasts lies <HI>Trum,
Sum, Burd, Purd Burf, Turf,</HI> and <HI>Pulg,</HI>
which joyns to the Sea. Thus the Au∣stralian
Territories contain twenty se∣ven
different Countries, which are all
very considerable, and are altogether
about three thousand Legues in length,
and four or five hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>The Vally which is on the other side
of the Mountains is sometimes twenty
degrees broad, and sometimes but six on∣ly,
it is parted by two Rivers, which are
very broad at the mouth, one of which
runs to the West, and is called <HI>Sulm,</HI> and
the other to the East, named <HI>Hulm.</HI></P>
<P>The length of this Country is about
eight hundred Leagues, and its breadth
six hundred in some places, but in most
but three. All this vast Land is called
<HI>Fund;</HI> and is under two or three Go∣vernors,
which very often make cruel
Wars, one against the other. But what
is most surprizing in the <HI>Australian</HI> Do∣minions,
is, that there is not one
Mountain to be seen; the Natives ha∣ving
levelled them all. To this prodi∣gy
may by added the admirable unifor∣mity
<PB N="52" REF="32"/>
of Languages, Customs, Buildings,
and other things which are to be met
with in this Country. 'Tis sufficient to
know one Quarter, to make a certain
judgment of all the rest; all which with∣out
doubt proceeds from the nature of
the people, who are all born with an
inclination of willing nothing contrary
to one another; and if it should happen
that any one of them had any thing that
was not Common, 'twould be impossible
for him to make use of it.</P>
<P>There are fifteen thousand <HI>Sezains,</HI> in
this prodigious Country: Each <HI>Sezain</HI>
contains sixteen quarters, without count∣ing
the <HI>Hub,</HI> and the four <HI>Hebs;</HI> there
is twenty five houses in each quarter,
and every house has four apartments,
which lodge four men each; so that
there is four hundred houses in each <HI>Se∣zain,</HI>
and six thousand four hundred per∣sons;
which being multiplied by fifteen
thousand <HI>Sezains,</HI> will shew the number
of the Inhabitants of the whole Land, to
be about fourscore and 16 Millions, with∣counting
all the Youth, and Masters lodg∣ed
in the <HI>Hebs,</HI> in each of which there
is at least eight hundred persons; and
as in the fifteen thousand <HI>Sezains,</HI> there
is sixty thousand <HI>Hebs,</HI> so the young
<PB N="53" REF="32"/>
men, and the Masters that teach them,
will be found to amount to near forty
eight millions.</P>
<P>The great House of the <HI>Sezain,</HI> which
they call the <HI>Hab,</HI> that is, the House of
elevation, is built only with diaphonous
and transparent Stones, like to our finest
Crystal, only these Stones are diversify'd
with a prodigious quantity of Figures of
all forts of colours, very fine and lively,
which by their infinite variety form
sometimes Images of Mankind, sometimes
represent the Fields in all their Beauty,
and sometimes Suns and other Figures,
of such a vivacity, as can never be too
much admired. The whole Building is
without any Artifice, except the curious
cut of this Stone, with Seats all round it,
and sixteen great Tables of a much more
lively red than that of our scarlet.</P>
<P>There is four very considerable En∣trances,
that answer to the four great ways
upon which it is situate: All without is
filled with very rare Inventions. They
ascend unto the top of it by a thousand
steps, upon which there is a kind of
Platform, that will easily contain forty
persons. The Pavement of this stately
House is much like our Jasper, but the
colours thereof are much more lively
<PB N="54" REF="33"/>
and are also full of Veins, of a very
rich blew, and a yellow which surpasses
the brightness of Gold: No one for a
constancy lives in it, but each Quarter
take their turns to supply the Tables for
the refreshment of Passengers. This
great House built in the middle of the
<HI>Sezain,</HI> and is about an hundred paces
daimeter, and three hundred and thirty
in circumference.</P>
<P>The House of the four Quarters by
them called <HI>Heb,</HI> which is the House of
Education, is built of the same Stone
that the <HI>Hab</HI> is paved with, except the
Roof of it, which is made of a transpa∣rent
Stone, through which the Light en∣ters
into it.</P>
<P>The Pavement of it something resem∣bles
our white Marble, but is intermixed
with a most lively red and green. This
fine Building is divided into four quar∣ters,
by twelve great Crossings, which
are made like four Semi-diameters: It is
about fifty paces diameter, and about an
hundred and fifty three paces in circuit.
Each Division is allotted to the Youth of
that Quarter it belongs to; and there is
at least two hundred Children, whose
Mothers, as soon as they have conceived
of them, enter there, and depart not
<PB N="55" REF="33"/>
till the Children are two years of age,
and then they go out, leaving them to
the Care of certain young men, who
are there on purpose to instruct them.
These young men, whereof there is a
very great number, are divided into five
Companies.</P>
<P>The first are employed in teaching
First-Principles, of which there are six
Masters. The second make it their busi∣ness
to give the common Reasons for
Natural things, among which there are
four Masters. The third are such as are
remitted to dispute, of whom there is
two Masters. The fourth are such as can
compose, and they have but one Master.
The fifth and last are those that expect
to be chose for Lieutenants, that is, to
fill the place of the Brethren that retire
from the World, of whom I shall give a
particular account afterwards.</P>
<P>These are the peculiar Officers of each
Quarter, which contribute to the main∣tenance,
and educating part of the World,
and they carry very regularly every day
what is necessary for their subsistence,
when they go to the Conference held in
the House.</P>
<P>The common Houses, which they call
<HI>Hebs,</HI> that is, the Habitation of Men, are
<PB N="56" REF="34"/>
in number twenty five in each Quarter,
each House twenty five paces diameter,
and fourscore paces in circumference.
They are divided like the <HI>Hebs,</HI> by two
great Walls, which make four distinct
separations, and end each at an Apart∣ment.
They are built with white Mar∣ble,
like the Pavement of the <HI>Hebs,</HI> ex∣cept
the cross Bars of the Windows, which
are of the same Crystal with the <HI>Habs,</HI>
for the conveniency of giving Light to
them. Each Apartment is inhabited by
four persons, whom they call the <HI>Cle,</HI>
that is, <HI>Brethren.</HI> There is nothing to
be seen in these Buildings but four kinds
of Benches, which serve them to rest them∣selves
on, and some Seats for the same
use.</P>
<P>The Partitions that they call <HI>Huids</HI> are
near three hundred paces in circumfe∣rence,
and sixty five in diameter: The
Figure of them is perfectly square, and
they are divided into twelve curious Al∣lies,
each of which goes round the Apart∣ments,
with a square place in the middle
that is six paces diameter.</P>
<P>The three first and greatest Rows are
beautified with Trees, which bear such
Fruits as are in great esteem amongst
them. These Fruits are as big as the
<PB N="57" REF="34"/>
Callebashes of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which are seven
or eight inches diameter. The inside of
them is red, and of a more exquisite
taste than any of our most delicate Meats,
one of which Fruits is sufficient to satisfie
four men, though never so hungry.</P>
<P>The next five are also planted with
Trees that bear Fruits of a charming yel∣low,
full of a most substantial Juice,
which is very refreshing: The Liquor of
one of these Fruits will quench any ones
thirst; and their custom is to drink three
of them at a Meal.</P>
<P>The four last rows are filled with little
Trees, which bear a Fruit about as large
as a Pappin, of a bright purple; its smell
is very fine, and so extraordinary the
taste, that I can compare nothing to it,
that we eat in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Fruit hath
a Propriety of causing Sleep according to
the proportion they eat thereof, some of
which they are accustom'd to eat every
night, and if they eat but one, they are
sure of sleeping three hours.</P>
<P>In each Alley they dig two Furrows of
an indifferent depth, in which there
grows Roots that bring forth three sorts
of Fruits, one of which is not unlike our
Melons; the second are as big as Boon∣chretins,
but of a lovely blue; and the
<PB N="58" REF="35"/>
third much resemble the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gourd,
but the colour and taste are very diffe∣rent.</P>
<P>These Fruits are equally in use through∣out
all parts of this vast Country for their
nourishment. They have no Ovens, nor
any way to bake any Meat for them:
They neither know what Kitchin or
Cook means; their Fruits fully satisfie
their Appetite, without ever the least of∣fending
their Stomachs; they also make
them strong and vigorous, and do not
overcharge them, or cause any digestion,
because they are perfectly ripe, and have
nothing green or crude remains in them.</P>
<P>There is a Tree in the middle of the
Square which is higher than the rest, that
bears a Fruit as big as our Olives, but the
colour red, they call it <HI>Balf,</HI> or Tree of
Beauty, whereof if they eat four, they
become excessively gay and sprightly; if
they eat six, they fall into a Sleep for
twenty four hours, but if they exceed
that number, they sleep eternally, which
mortal sleep is preceded, with all the signs
of the greatest Joy and Pleasure in the
World.</P>
<P>'Tis very seldom that the <HI>Australians</HI>
sing throughout their whole lives, and
never dance; but they have no sooner
<PB N="59" REF="35"/>
eat this Fruit in such quantity as I before
spoke of, but they sing and dance until
Death puts a period to their excessive
Mirth.</P>
<P>I ought not to forget, that all the Trees
which I have spoken of are at all times
full of ripe Fruits, Flowers, and Buds;
we have an Image of this marvellous
Fruitfulness in out Oranges, but with
this difference, that the severity of our
Winters and heats of our Summers very
much injure them; whereas in this Coun∣try
it is a very difficult thing to be able
to observe any alteration.</P>
<P>From what I have said, it is easie to
imagin, that this great Country is plain,
without <HI>Forests, Marshes,</HI> or <HI>Desarts,</HI> and
equally, inhabited throughout; never∣theless
it descends somewhat towards the
Line, and there is an insensible ascention
on the side of the Pole; but in four or
five hundred leagues it gains at least three
in height.</P>
<P>There is a great quantity of Water
that runs from the Mountains <HI>Juads,</HI> and
the <HI>Australians</HI> know how to conduct
them so exactly, that they have brought
them round all their <HI>Sezains, Quarters,</HI>
and <HI>Apartments,</HI> which contribute much
to the fruitfulness of their Grounds.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="36"/>
The Descent which I spoke of is not
only in respect to the Continent, but the
Sea also, which is so shallow for three
league, that it is troublesome to go with
a Boat thereon; it is not upon the side of
the shore a Fingers depth, and after a
league it is not above a foot deep, and so
on in proportion; from whence it is easie
to conceive, that 'tis impossible to come
to this Land from the Sea side, without
the assistance of some few Rivers, which
are only known to the Inhabitants of this
Country.</P>
<P>This same Descent is the cause also
that this whole Land is turn'd directly to∣wards
the Sun, to receive its Rays, and
with so much advantage, that it is al∣most
every where alike fertile; after
such a manner, that we may say, the
Mountains, which are over against its
Pole, are so raised by Nature, and placed
there, only to preserve this happy Coun∣try
from the Rigours of the Sun. Be∣sides,
these terrible Bulwarks serve to
stop the Rays of the Sun, and reflect
them back to the farthest parts of this
Country; and 'tis upon this account that
its <HI>Inhabitants</HI> rejoyce in the possession of
a Happiness, which all the <HI>Northern</HI> Peo∣ple
are destitute of, which is to have nei∣ther
<PB N="61" REF="36"/>
ther excess of Heat in Summer, nor Cold
in Winter, or rather to have properly
neither Winter nor Summer.</P>
<P>This Proposition ought not to surprize
the Geographers, who having divided
the Earth into two equal parts, by the
Equinoxial Line, place as much heat and
cold on one side, as on the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun∣ded
upon this Principle, that the proxi∣mity
or distance of the Sun causes Sum∣mer
or Winter throughout the whole
Earth: But there are also Geographers
which have corrected this Error, and
without any knowledge of the <HI>Australian</HI>
Land▪ have observed, that if his Princi∣ple
was true, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of necessity be al∣ways
hotter in <HI>Guinea,</HI> and in the <HI>Molu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣coes,</HI>
than in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> because
the Sun is never so far distant: Which is
contrary to the Experience of all those
that have made a Voyage into that
Country, who assure us, the greatest heats
there are always in the Dog-days, and
the greatest Colds when the Sun is in
the Signs of <HI>Aquaries</HI> and <HI>Pisces,</HI> altho' it
is farther from them when it is in <HI>Capri∣corn.</HI>
It is therefore most certain, that
Winter and Summer happen universally
throughout all the Earth in the same
time, altho' with great difference, accor∣ding
<PB N="62" REF="37"/>
to the different situations of the
Countries. I say moreover, the nearness
of the Sun contributes so little to the heat
of the Earth, that if we do but narrowly
observe it, we shall find when it is nearest
'tis then that the least heat is se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; for 'tis
well known in <HI>Europe,</HI> that the Months
of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> are not so hot as <HI>July</HI>
and <HI>August;</HI> and there is often Frosts in
<HI>June,</HI> when the Sun is in its greatest ele∣vation;
and scorching heats in <HI>July,</HI> when
it is gone some distance from them; it is
therefore some other cause than its Proxi∣mity
that heats the Earth. It happens
very often in its entire absence, even at
night, the heat is much greater than in
the day, when it is present.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Astralians,</HI> they
know not what Rain is in this Country, no
more than in <HI>Africa:</HI> Nor do they ever
hear any Thunders &amp; 'tis but very rarely
that they see any fleeting C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouds. There
is neither Flyes, nor Caterpillars, nor any
other Insect. There's neither Spider, nor
Serpent, nor any venomous Beast to be
seen. In a word, 'tis a Land full of Deli∣cacies,
which are not to be met with in any
other part of the World, and which is
likewise exempted from all the Inconve∣niencies
that other places are troubled
with.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Constitutions of the <HI>Australians,</HI>

<P>ALL the <HI>Australians</HI> are of both Sexes,
or Hermaphrodi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and if it hap∣pens
that a Child is born but of one, they
strangle him as a Monster. They are nim∣ble,
and very active; their Flesh is more
upon the red than Vermilian; they are
commonly eight foot high, their Face
pretty long, Forehead large, their Eyes in
the upper part of their Heads, and Mouth
small, their Lips of a deep red coral, Nose
more enclined to be long than round, and
Beard and Hair alway black, which they
never cut because they grow but little;
their Chin is long, and turns a little a∣gain;
their Neck slender; their Shoul∣ders
large and high; they have very lit∣tle
Breasts, placed very low, a little redder
than Vermilian; their Arms are nervous
and their Hands pretty broad and long;
they have a high Chest, but flat Belly, who
appears but little when they are big with
Child; their Hips high; their Thighs
large, and Legs long: They are so accu∣stomed
to go naked, that they think they
cannot speak of covering themselves
without being declared Enemies to
Nature, and deprived of Reason.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="38"/>
Every one is obliged at least to present one child
to the <HI>Heb:</HI> But they bring them forth in so private
a manner, that it is accounted a crime amongst
them to speak of the necessary conjuction in the
propagation of mankind.</P>
<P>In all the time▪ that I was there, I could never dis∣cover
how Generation work was performed amongst
them; I have only observ'd, that they all lov'd one
another with a cordial love, and that they never lo∣ved
any one more than another. I can affirm, that
in 30 years that I have been with them, I nei<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her
saw <HI>Quarrel</HI> or <HI>Animosity</HI> amongst them. They know
not how to distinguish between <HI>mine and thine,</HI> they
have all things in common amongst them, with so
much sincerity and disinterestness, which charm'd
me so much the more, because I had never seen
the like in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I always used to speak what I thought; but I was
a little too free in declaring what I did not like in
their <HI>Manners,</HI> sometimes to a Brother, sometimes
to another, even by maintaining with Arguments
mine own Opinions; I spoke of their Nakedness
with certain terms of aversion, which extreamly of∣fended
them. I one day stopt a Brother, and wag∣gishly
demanded of him, with a seeming earnestness,
where were the Fathers of those Children that were
a ready born, and told him, that I thought it ridi∣culous
for them to affect such a <HI>silence</HI> in that point.
This Discourse, and some others of the like nature,
gave the <HI>Australians</HI> a kind of hatred for me, and
many of them having maintain'd that I was but half
a man, had concluded▪ that they ought to destroy
me, which would have been, but for the assistance
of a venerable old man, <HI>Master</HI> of the third Order
in the <HI>Heb,</HI> called <HI>Suains,</HI> who vindicated my cause
several times in the Assemblies of the <HI>Hab;</HI> but
seeing I still maintained such Discourses as offended
the <HI>Brethren,</HI> he took me one day <HI>by my self,</HI> &amp; said in a
<PB N="65" REF="38"/>
Cold and grave Tone: <HI>It is no longer doubted but
thou art a Monster, thy evil Genius and insolent dis∣course,
hath made thee detested amongst us. Some have
a long time design'd to destroy thee, and had it not been
for the Action which we our selves saw thee do, thou
shouldst have been put to death soon after thou arrivedst
here. Tell me freely, who art thou, and how camest thou
here?</HI> The fear that these words put me in, toge∣ther
with the obligation that I had to this Man,
made me ingeniously declare my Countrey, and
the Adventures that had brought me amongst them.</P>
<P>The old Man testifyed a great deal of pity for
me, and assured me, that if for the time to come
I would shew my self more reserv'd in my Man∣ners
and Discourse, what was past should be for∣gotten.
He also told me he should live two years
longer to support me; and his Lieutenant being
but Young, he would choose me in his Place. I know
well, <HI>says he,</HI> That being arriv'd in a Countrey
where thou seest many things contrary to what is
practised in thine, thou hast some reason to be
surprized and astonished; but as 'tis an inviolable
custom with us to suffer no half-Man amongst us,
as soon as we discover him either by his Sex or
Actions; And altho' both Sexes save thee, yet
thy manner of acting condemns thee, and there∣fore
thou must correct thy self, if thou wilt be suf∣fered
amongst us. The best Council that I can give
thee to that end is, that thou come without a∣ny
fear, and discover all thy doubts to me, and I
will give thee all the satisfaction thou canst wish
for, provided thou beest discreet. I promis'd him
an inviolable fidelity: I swore I would be guided
wholly by him; and protested that for the future
I would keep such a guard upon my self, that I
would offend no body. The Old Man accepted
all my Propositions, and promised me he would
serve me as a Father as long as I performed those
<PB N="66" REF="39"/>
promises I had made to him. <HI>And to begin that
strict Commerce that I intend to keep with thee,</HI> con∣tinued
he, <HI>thou shalt know that having seen thy Com∣bat,
I could not without trouble be perswaded that
thou wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but a half-Man. I saw afterwards that thou
hadst all the Marks of a perfect Man, a large Fore∣head,
a long Visage; and have still observed that thou
reason'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on many things: 'Tis these Considerations
that perswaded me to defend thee against those Ene∣mies
that thou hast here made thy self. Now tell me
how they live in thy Countrey, if all that Inhabit it
are Men of Body and Mind like to thee; if Avarice
and Ambition does not reign amongst them. In fine, ex∣plain
to me the Customs and Manners of thy Countrey
without any disguise; I demand this one Proof of that
Fidelity and Sincerity that thou hast promised me.</HI></P>
<P>I was perswaded in the Condition I saw my
self reduced to, that to dissemble was to expose
my Life, wherefore I thought I was oblig'd to
answer sincerely, and without giving him any cause
of distrust: I gave him therefore a particular ac∣count
of my Countrey according to the Rules of
<HI>Geography:</HI> I made him understand the great Con∣tinent
we dwell in, to which we give the Name
of <HI>Europe and Africa;</HI> I extended my Discourse
at large upon the different kinds of Animals,
which those Countries produce; and this good
Man admired nothing more than what we the
most dispise, <HI>Flyes, Insects, and Worms, &amp;c.</HI> And
could not apprehend how such little Animals cou'd
enjoy Life and arbitrary Motion. I made him a
particular recital of the several things they were
nourished by; from whence he concluded by a
Reasoning, which our best Physitians have not
been ignorant of, that it was impossible that we
should be long liv'd. In which I agreed with
him, and assured him 'twas very rare to see any
person amongst us arrive to <HI>an hundred years of
<PB N="67" REF="39"/>
Age,</HI> but that Nature had seem'd sufficiently to
provide for this defect, by means of Generation,
whereby one Man and one Woman were able to
beget ten or twelve Children. He slightly pas∣sed
by this matter, pushed on with impatience
he had to hear me upon others. I confest to
him that both Sexes in one person was so rare
amongst the <HI>Europeans,</HI> that such as happen'd
to be born so, past for Monsters amongst them;
and as for reasoning, I assur'd him that al∣most
every one was taught it, and that there
were publick Lectures made in many places. The
Old Man interrupted me then. <HI>Thou advancest
too much,</HI> said he to me, <HI>take heed thou dost not
cut thy self off, mingle not Contradictions with thy
Relations; thou canst never reconcile the use of Reason
with the exclusion of both Sexes in one person; and what
thou addest, that many reason among you, and that they
make publick Lectures in divers places, proves only
that reasoning is banished from you.</HI> The first fruit
of reasoning is to know, and this knowledge on
necessity carries us to two things. The first, that
to be Man it is necessary to be entire and com∣pleat.
The second, that to this end it is neces∣sary
to be able to reason upon every thing
that presents it self to us. Your pretended Men
have not the first, since they are all imperfect;
nor have they the second, since there's so few
amongst them able to Reason. Canst thou say
any thing against these Consequences? I answer'd
him, that Reason taught us a Being was perfect
when it wanted nothing that Constituted its Na∣ture,
and that therefore to add to it what good
things another possest, would not render it more
perfect, but rather make it Monstrous. <HI>The Light
of the Sun is</HI> an admirable thing, <HI>added I,</HI> There
is nothing more beautiful than this <HI>Charming
Creature,</HI> by which we see all others, yet it could
<PB N="68" REF="40"/>
never be prudent to say, that Man was perfect
because he possest not this Rich Treasure of Light?
It is necessary therefore first, to establish what Con∣stitues
the Nature and Perfection of Man, then
we must certainly agree, and may Judge infallibly
of those that are perfect, and such as are defec∣tive.
Thou Arguest Justly, replyed the <HI>Old Man,</HI>
I'll convince thee therefore by thy own Principles.
Thou knowest assuredly that Man is made of two
things, a Body more perfect then that of other
Animals, and a <HI>mind more Clear and Bright;</HI> the per∣fection
of the Body employs every thing that a
Body may and can contain without deformity;
and that of the Mind requires a knowledge
that extends to what ever can be known, or at
least a faculty of reasoning which may conduce
to this extent of Knowledge. Tell me then, is
there not more perfection in possessing solely
what composes a Humane Body then in being
endowed but with one half thereof? Now it
it certain, that both Sexes are necessary for the
perfection of an entire Man. Wherefore I have
reason to say those that have but one, are im∣perfect.
To which I answered, that we ought
to consider Man as other Animals in respect to
his Body, and that as an Animal cannot be cal∣led
imperfect in its kind, because it is but of
one Sex, so ever we cannot reasonably say, that
Man is imperfect, because he also is but of one.
And that on the contrary, the confusion of Sex∣es
in the same person, ought rather to pass for
a Monstrous thing, then for a degree of per∣fection.
Thy Manner of Arguing <HI>answer'd he</HI>
supposes you to be Just, as I presume you are, that
is, <HI>Beasts;</HI> and if I cannot absolutely say you
are such, tis because there remains upon you
some Marks of Humanity; and as you seem to
keep a kind of medium between Man and Beast,
<PB N="69" REF="40"/>
I believe I do you no injury in calling you <HI>half-Men.</HI>
As to what thou sayest added he, that we are
like to Beasts in respect to our Bodies, 'tis a ve∣ry
great error to distinguish as thou dost between
the mind of Man and his Body; the Union of
these two parts are after such a manner that one
is comprehended in the other; so that all the
Powers imaginable cannot take any thing from
Man, no not even from his Body, which is so ab∣solutely
Humane, that it can never agree with that
of a Beast; and by consequence Man in whatsoever
belongs to him, is perfectly distinct from Beast.
My Old Man in this place seeing that I had a
great desire to make some reply, permitted me:
Therefore said I to him, <HI>can it be deny'd that Man
agrees with the Beast in what regards Matter, where∣of
the Bodies of each were formed? Is it not equally
said of both, that they feel, they cry, and perform all
the operations of their Senses? Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>it may
be deny'd, and I formally do it.</HI></P>
<P>Man has nothing as Man, that agrees with
the Beast; all the Chymerical Conceptions where∣with
thou entertainest thy self are only defects of
thy reasoning, which unites what cannot be joyn'd
together, and disunities what is inseparable; for
Example, when we say that Body in general equal∣ly
respects Man and Beast; we mean that the word
Body may be equally applyed to both, because
of some Analogy there is in Common between
them, yet however there is always a most es∣sential
difference between them. A Beast hath
perfect Conformity only with another Beast, and
that because their Sexes are separate, upon which
account it is necessary, that they reunite for the
propagation of their kind; But this Union can
never be so perfect to make two Animals one
perfect Being; neither can they continue long
together, without being obliged to a Separation.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="41"/>
Wherefore it is necessary for them to seek again
anew for themselves, and they live in a kind of
Languishment while they are distant one from a∣nother.
<HI>As for us,</HI> added he, <HI>we are entire Men;
wherefore we live without being sensible of any of
these Animal Ardours one for another, and we cannot
hear them spoke of without horrour: Our Love has
nothing Carnal, nor Brutall in it; we are suf∣ficiently
satisfyed in our selves, we have no need to
seek any happiness from without, and live contented,
as you see we do.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd not hear this man speak without reflect∣ing
on that great Principle of our Philosophy; that
the <HI>more perfect a Being is,</HI> the less need it has
of any Assistance from without.</P>
<P>I made some Reflections upon the Operations
of the Sovereign Being: I concluded a Creature
cou'd not better resemble him, then in acting sim∣ply
and alone like him, in all its Producti∣ons;
and that an Action which was perform'd by
the concourse of two persons, cou'd not be so per∣fect
as that which was made by one only. My
Old Man perceived by the Suspension of my
mind, that I began to be pleas'd with his Reasons;
wherefore laying aside the rest of his Arguments,
and changing the discourse, demanded of me, that
in case two persons concurr'd in the production of
the same Child, to which of them it belong'd to by
right. I answer'd him equally to both; and al∣ledg'd
the example of many Animals, who made
it appear by their reciprocal cares, that their
young ones belong'd inseparably to each. But he
with indignation rejected the example of Animals,
and told me, <HI>he would have no further Conference with
me, except I wou'd omit making any farther use of it;
because by that I confirmed him,</HI> he said, <HI>what he in∣tended
to prove to me, that our production savour'd more
of Beast than man,</HI> and therefore he might with
<PB N="71" REF="41"/>
justice look upon us as Half-Men. He added, <HI>that
this Mutual and indivisible Possession was lyable to
great difficulties, because the Will of two cou'd never be
so regulated, but one wou'd wish sometimes what was
contrary to the other, which wou'd undoubtedly produce
many Contestations.</HI> To which I answer'd, <HI>There was
great subordination in this possession, and that the Mo∣ther
and Child were both subject to the Father;</HI> but the
word Father being wholly unknown to the <HI>Austra∣lians,</HI>
I was obliged to express it in such terms
as he might most probably understand me; he
made me repeat it to him three times, and least
he shou'd not apprehend me, he explain'd to me
what Idea he had conceiv'd of it: After which he
was entirely persuaded of the common opinion of
the <HI>Australians,</HI> that we cou'd not be Men, and
cryed to himself with an extraordinary severity,
<HI>O where is Judgment? Where is Reason? Where is the
Man? Where is the Man?</HI> which he repeated three
times; I told him, <HI>The Laws of the Country deter∣mined
it so, and that it was not without foundation, since
the Father being the Principle cause of Generation, it was
to him, that the Issue that might be produced, ought prin∣cipally
to belong.</HI></P>
<P>Let us discourse in order upon this matter, said
he, <HI>Thou hast advanced that the Father and Mother act
together to produce it; thou hast made me apprehend, that
the Mother is the most nearly concern'd in it; from whence
is it then that thou concludest the Father ought to be
lookt upon as the Principle Cause? If there is a pre∣cedency,
why givest thou it to the Father, since the Mo∣ther
seems to me to have the greatest share in it? Wou'd
it not be more reasonable to look upon this pretended
Father as the accidental Cause, and the Mother, with∣out
whom it is impossible it shou'd have Being, as the
natural and chief Cause? But tell me freely, Is this
Mother so tyed to the Father, that she cannot unite
her self with any other Man?</HI> I answered him with
<PB N="72" REF="42"/>
a great deal of sincerity, <HI>That it was not only pos∣sible,
but that it often happened.</HI> If so replied he, in∣terrupting
me, <HI>He that takes the Title of Father can
never be certain he is effectively so; nothing is more ri∣diculous
therefore, than to look upon him as Principal
Cause, who has concurr'd in the producing a Child,
since it is always uncertain, whether it was his or no;
and you cannot without Injustice take this Quality from
that of the two persons that you call Mother, to speak just∣ly
of things as they are in themselves.</HI> I found my self
shock't by the Discourse of this Old man; and al∣tho
I cou'd not consent to his Reason, which over∣turn'd
all our Laws, I cou'd not hinder my self
from making a thousand Reflections, and confessing
that they treated that Sex with too much severity,
from whom all Mankind receiv'd so many obliga∣tions:
My thoughts furnished me then with an
hundred reasons to maintain what my Philoso∣pher
had asserted; I found my self forc'd to be∣lieve
that this great power which man had usurped
over Woman, was rather the effect of an odious
Tyranny, than a Legitimate Authority.</P>
<P>The first part of my proposition being found
void, we entred upon the second, which was in
respect to the understanding of the <HI>Europeans;</HI>
but my Old Man spoke of it very briefly, think∣ing
I had said all that I cou'd upon the first head.
<HI>I doubt no longer now,</HI> said he, <HI>what you</HI> Europe∣ans
<HI>are, it is a point which is fully clear'd. Never∣theless,</HI>
added he, <HI>as it cannot be deny'd, but thou hast
shewn something extraordinary both in thy Courage and
Reasoning; so it is necessary that I know from whence
it might proceed: I assured him, that what he had
seen me do in the Combat, was rather an effect of
my dispair than courage: That we had no such Fools
to engage with amongst us, but that Men fought
sometimes amongst themselves, till they had utterly
<PB N="73" REF="42"/>
destroy'd one another. They are
exactly like the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A kind of <HI>Barba∣rians</HI> who border'd upon the <HI>Austra∣lians.</HI></NOTE> Fondins,
said he, <HI>and as I was going to
proceed: Thou hast,</HI> added he,
<HI>been with us long enough to
know us, and to be perswa∣ded
of the Wisdom of our Conduct.</HI> This word Man
which carries with it so necessary a consequence
of Reason and Humanity, obliges us to an Uni∣on
which is so perfect amongst us, that we know
not what Division and Discord is; wherefore thou
must confess, either that we are more than Men,
or that we are less than Men, since that you are
so far from our perfection. To which I answer'd
it could not be deny'd but that the divers Cli∣mates
contributed much to the different In∣clinations
of their Inhabitants; that from thence
it happen'd, that some were more eager, others
more calm, some dull, others quick, which diver∣sity
of Temperaments was the ordinary cause of
Divisions, Wars, and all other Dissentions, which
arm Men against one another; but he laught at
this Reason, maintaining, That man as man, could
never cease to be man, that is, humane, reasonable,
affable, without passion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because 'tis in this,
that the nature of man consists; and as the Sun
cannot be a Sun when it does not give light; so a
man cannot be a man but he must differ essentially
from Beasts, in whom Madness, Gluttony, Cruelty,
and other Vices and Passions are a consequence of
their imperfect and defective Nature, that the who
was the Subject of these Defaults, was no more than
a vain and deceitful Image of a Man, or rather a
true Beast.</P>
<P>I confess, that I could not hearken to this Dis∣course
without admiration! and nothing ever edi∣fyed
me more than this purity of Morals, inspir'd
by the only light of Nature and Reason. My Phi∣losopher
<PB N="74" REF="43"/>
having ask'd me what I thought of that
way of Reasoning? I answered, <HI>That indeed my
mind had been cultivated by Study, and that nothing was
omitted in my Education, that might carefully inform my
Judgment.</HI> Upon which he demanded, if the like
care was not equally taken throughout the World,
and having answered that indeed, he had more to
say upon that point; he included after his common
manner; this Irregularity caus'd many disorders,
disputes, heats and complaints, because he that
knew least (seeing others above him which knew
more) esteem'd himself the more unhappy, that
Birth had made all alike. <HI>As for us,</HI> added he, <HI>we
make a Profession of being all Equal, Our glory consists in
being all alike, and to be dignify'd with the same Care,
and in the same manner; all the difference that there is,
is only in the divers Exercises to which we apply our
selves, so as to find out new Inventions, that the Dis∣coverers
may contribute them to the Publick Good.</HI>
After this, he spoke to me of <HI>Habits,</HI> which he
call'd Superfluities amongst the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and
I assur'd him, that they had as great an horror
amongst them to see a Person Naked, as the
<HI>Australians</HI> had to see them in Cloaths; I al∣ledg'd
for Reasons of this use, Modesty, the Ri∣gour
of the Season and Custom.</P>
<P>To this, as I remember, he answered, <HI>That custom
so much prevails upon your minds, that one would believe
every thing necessary that you practice from your Birth,
and that you can't change a Custom without as great a
violence as changing your own Nature.</HI> I replyed, by
insisting upon the Reason of divers Climates,
and told him, <HI>That there were some Countries amongst
the</HI> Europeans, <HI>where the Cold was insupportable to
the Body, which was more delicate than that of the</HI> Aust∣ralians,
<HI>and that there were some that even dy'd upon
it, and that it was impossible to subsist without Cloaths:</HI>
In fine, I told him, <HI>That the weakness of the nature</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="43"/>
<HI>of either Sex was such, that there was no looking upon
one that was</HI> Naked without Blushing, and Shame,
<HI>and without being sensible of such Emotions, as</HI> Modesty
<HI>oblig'd me to pass over in silence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is there a Consequence in all that thou hast advanc'd</HI>
(said he) <HI>and from whence can this custom come? Is not
this to father upon all the world what is contrary to Na∣ture?
We are</HI> Born Naked, <HI>and we can't be cover'd
without believing that 'tis shameful to be seen as we are;
but as to what thou say'st concerning the</HI> Rigour of the
Seasons, <HI>I can't, nay, I ought not to give any credit to
it; for if this Country is so insupportable, what is it
that obliges him that knows what Reason is, to make it
his Country? must not he be more silly than a Beast, that
will tarry in those places where the Air is mortal
at certain Seasons.</HI></P>
<P>When Nature makes an Animal, it gives him
the liberty of Motion to seek what is good and a∣void
that which is evil. How opinionative then
is man to stay where he is threatned on all sides,
and where he must be in a Continual Torment to
preserve himself? Certainly he must have lost all
his senses, if ever he had any; as for the weakness
which thou calls <HI>Modesty,</HI> I have nothing to say to
it, since thou confessest with so much sincerity
that it is a fault, 'tis truly a great weakness which
will not permit us to look upon one another with
resenting the <HI>Brutal Motions</HI> which thou speakest of.
Beasts continually see themselves and one another,
but this sight causes no alteration in them: How
then can you who believe your selves of a Superior
order to them be more weak than they? or else
it must be that your Sight is weaker than that
of Animals, since you can't see through a single
<HI>Covering</HI> what is under; for there are some of them
that can even penetrate through a Wall; this is
all that I can Judge of those of thy Country, because
thou tellest me they have some <HI>Sparks of Reason,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="44"/>
but they are so weak, that instead of enlightning
them, they only serve to conduct 'em more surely
in their Error. If 'tis true that their Country is
inhabitable, at least that they make use of <HI>Cloath
and Covering</HI> for the ends thou hast mention'd,
they are just like those persons who instead of get∣ting
away from an Evident danger, reason finely
how they may preserve themselves, by covering
themselves without avoiding the occasion; but if
it be true that Cloaths render you wise in the Eyes
of one onother, I know not how to compare you
better than to little Children who no more know
an Object when once it is vail'd.</P>
<P>As for me I rather believe that 'tis deformity
amongst you which made you first invent cloathing,
and that it not only authorizes it now but also conti∣nues
it; for there is nothing in a Man <HI>finer than
himself</HI> when he is without defects, and has all the
Natural Qualities which concur to his entire per∣fection.</P>
<P>I harkned to this man rather as an <HI>Oracle</HI> than
a Philosopher; all the propositions which he advan∣ced
were backt with such <HI>Invincible Reasoning.</HI> He
said no more on this point, but without giving me
time to answer, he past to that of Covetousness.</P>
<P>I early perceived that he knew no more of it
but the Name, for having desired him to explain
what he ment by it, I understood that his Idea
of it, was a <HI>weakness of mind,</HI> which consisted in
heaping up fine things without any profit.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Australians</HI> forsake somethings that are
necessary for their entertainment, but they know
not what it is to heap up, nor to keep any thing
against <HI>to Morrow,</HI> and their manner of living thus
may pass for a <HI>Perfect Image of the State
that man at first enjoyed in Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Ambition,</HI> he had a gross Idea of it;
but he defin'd it a desire of mens being elevat∣ed
above others.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="44"/>
I told him that in <HI>Europe</HI> they held it for a
Maxim, that the <HI>Multitude</HI> without any order begat
confusion, in which there was no gust of the good
things in Life, and that Order suppos'd a <HI>Head,</HI>
to which all others were subject. From hence the
Old Man took occasion to explain a Doctrine, of
which I indeed conceiv'd the meaning; but 'tis im∣possible
to discover the Knowledge of it to others
in so strong and powerful terms as these which he
made use of to make me understand it. He said,
that it was the Nature of Man <HI>to be born and live free,</HI>
and that therefore he could not be Subjected with∣out
being dispoil'd of his Nature; and that in such
a subjection Man was made to descend below Beasts,
because a Beast being only made for the service of
Man, <HI>Subjection was after some manner Natural to it.</HI>
But one man could not be born for the service of
another Man; a Constraint in this Case would
be a sort of violence which would even degrade a
Man after a certain manner from his proper Exist∣ence;
he enlarged much to prove that the Sub∣jection
of one Man to another was a Subjection of
the humane Nature, and making a Man a <HI>sort of
Slave to himself,</HI> which Slavery implyed such a
Contradiction and violence as was impossible to
conceive. He added that the <HI>Essence of Man con∣sisting
in Liberty,</HI> it could not be taken away with∣out
destroying him, and therefore he that would
take away anothers Liberty, did tacitly bid him to
subsist without his own Essence.</P>
<P>Our Conference lasted above <HI>four hours,</HI> and if
the hour of publick Assembly had not interrupted
as, we were in a disposition to have discours'd
much longer. I entred the <HI>Hab</HI> with a mind full of
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the reasoning which I had heard, admiring the
Knowledge and great Light wherewith this People
were endu'd. The strength of this Mans Reasons
<HI>suspended my Senses,</HI> and I past the time of this As∣sembly
<PB N="78" REF="45"/>
in a kind of an Astonishment; it seem'd to
me that <HI>I saw things after another Fashion than before:</HI>
I was for above Eight Hours, as it were forc'd to
make continual Comparisons <HI>betwixt what I was,
and what I saw; I could not but admire a Conduct so
apposite to our defective one, that</HI> I <HI>was asham'd to re∣member
how far we were from the perfection of these
People.</HI> I said in my self, can it be true that we are
not all made Men? but, added I, <HI>If it is not so, what
is the difference of these People from us? They are by the
ordinary state of Life elevated to a pitch of a Vertue
which we cannot attain but by the greatest efforts of our
most noble Ideas. Our best Morality is not capable of
better Reasoning,</HI> nor more exactness, than what
they practice Naturally without Rules, and with∣out
Precepts; this <HI>Ʋnion which nothing can alter, this
distance from Worldly Goods, this inviolable Purity;</HI>
in a word, this adherence to strict Reason, which
unites them amongst themselves, and carries them
to what is good and just, can't but be the <HI>Fruits of
a consummate Vertue,</HI> than which we can con∣ceive
nothing more perfect; but on the contrary,
how many Vices and Imperfections are we not sub∣ject
to? <HI>This insatiable thirst after Riches, these con∣tinual
dissentions, these black Treasons, bloody Conspi∣racies,
and cruel Butcheries,</HI> which we are continu∣ally
exercising towards one another; don't these
things force us to acknowledge that we are guided
by Passion rather than Reason? Is it not to be
wisht that in this Estate, one of these Men
which we may call <HI>Barbarians</HI> would come to
disabuse us, <HI>and appear in so much Vertue as they
practice purely by their Natural Light,</HI> to confound
the Vanity which we draw from our pretend∣ed
Knowledge, and by the assistance of which
we only <HI>live like Beasts.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion of the <HI>Australians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is no Subject more curious and secret
among the <HI>Australians,</HI> than that of their
Religion; 'tis a crime of Innovation even to speak
of it, either by Dispute or a Form of Explana∣tion;
even the Mothers do with the first Principles
of Knowledge, inspire into the Child that of the
<HI>Hab,</HI> that is to say, <HI>incomprehensible.</HI> They believe
that this Incomprehensible Being is every where,
and they have all imaginable Veneration for him,
but they recommend carefully to the young Men to
Adore him always, without speaking of him, and
they are perswaded that it was a very great Crime,
to make his Divine Perfections the Subject of their
Discourses, so that one may in a manner say, that
their great Religion is not to speak of Religion. As
I had been brought up in Maxims very different
from theirs, I could have no gust in a Worship
without Ceremonies, nor accommodate my self to
a Religion where I never heard the Name of God
mentioned. This caused great disquiet in me for
some time, but at length I discover'd my troubles
to my Old Phylosopher, who having heard me,
took me by the hand, and conducting me into a
Walk; he said to me with a very gave Air, <HI>Is it
possible that you should be more a Man in the knowledge
of the</HI> Hab <HI>than in your other Actions; open thy Heart,
and I promise thee to conceal nothing from thee.</HI> I was
ravisht to find such a favourable opportunity to
learn the particular Faith of these People: I then
told my Old Man, that we had two sorts of the
Knowledge of God in <HI>Europe,</HI> the one Natural, the
other supernatural. Nature instructed us that there
<PB N="80" REF="46"/>
was a Soveraign Being, the Author and Preser∣ver
of all things: I can see this Truth, <HI>added I,</HI>
with my Eyes, <HI>when I behold the Earth view tbe Hea∣vens,
or reflect upon my self;</HI> when I see such things
as are not made but by a Superiour Cause, I am
obliged to acknowledge and adore a Being, which
cannot be made, and which made all things else.
When <HI>I</HI> consider my self, <HI>I</HI> am assured that <HI>I</HI> could
not be without a beginning, therefore it follows,
that a person like me would not give me to be,
and by consequence this puts me upon seeking out
a first Being, who having had no Beginning, must
be the Original of all other things. When my
Reason conducted me to this first Principle, <HI>I</HI>
concluded evidently, that this Being cannot be
limited, because limits suppose a necessity of pro∣duction
and dependance.</P>
<P>The Old Man interrupting my discourse in my
last words, told me with many <HI>fine Remarks,</HI>
that if our <HI>Europeans</HI> could form this reasoning, they
were not altogether depriv'd of the most solid
Knowledge; <HI>I always reasoned thus with my self,</HI>
added he, <HI>as thou hast done, and altho' the way
of ariving to this Truth by these kind of Reflecti∣ons,
be extreamly long, yet I am perswaded that 'tis
feasible. I confess nevertheless that the great Revo∣lutions
of many thousand Ages may have caused
great Alteration in what we see; but my Mind
permits me not from hence either to conceive an
Eternity, or apprehend a General production with∣out
the</HI> Conduct of a Soveraign Being,
who is the Supream Governour; for
this would be an Abuse upon him, and
<HI>charge him with Error amongst a thousand Re∣volutions,
if we averr that all we see, happned by the
fortuitous rancounters which have had no other princi∣ples
but that of local motion and the justling together of
little small Bodies. This is to perplex one's self in such</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="46"/>
<HI>difficulties as we can never resolve, and to put us in dan∣ger
of committing an Execrable Blasphemy; this is to give
to the Creature what belongs to the Creator, and by
consequence to repay him with an insupportable in∣gratitude
to whom we are obliged for what we are
and have, Even at what time we conceive that the
Eternity of Atoms is possible; it is certain the contra∣ry
opinion is no less, not to say more probable. This
would be as wilful a Crime as to admit that Atoms
are capable of sentiment and knowledge.</HI> 'Twas
these Considerations that oblig'd us about 45
Revolutions since, to suppose a first Being, and
to teach it as the foundation of all our Principles,
without suffering that any one should teach any
Doctrine which should oppose this Truth. I hark∣ned
to the discourse of this Man, with all the atten∣tion
that I was capable of; the Grace with which
he spoke, and the weight which he gave to his
words, perswaded me no less than his reasons; but
as I saw he was about to ask me a new Question, I
prevented him, and said, <HI>That altho one shou'd grant
the Eternity of these little Bodies, we have spoken of,</HI> yet
they <HI>could never frame this World, and diversify it as
we now see it, according to this indisputable principle;
things continuing in the same State, cannot produce other
things different from them.</HI> Thus these <HI>Atoms</HI> having no
difference amongst themselves but Number and plu∣rality,
could only make formless Heaps, and of that
same Quality with themselves. <HI>That which is most
difficult to certain mind,</HI> (said he,) <HI>is the great Obstruc∣tion
of this Being of Beings, which is no more discoverable
than if he was not at all; but I found this reason of little
weight, because we have many others which oblige us to
believe that he is too far above us to manifest himself to
us otherwise than by his works; If his Condust was par∣ticular,
I should be at a loss to perswade my self that it
was his, since an universal Being ought to act after an
universal manner.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="47"/>
But if it be true, replyed I, that you cannot doubt
of a first and Sovereign Origine of all things, why
have you not establisht a Religion for to adore him?
The <HI>Europeans</HI> who have such a knowledge of him
as you have, have <HI>Set hours for his Worship,</HI> they have
Prayers to call upon him, and Praises to Glorify
him with, and his Commandments to keep;
you speak very freely of that <HI>Hab,</HI> said he, inter∣rupting
me; yes without doubt answered I, tis a
Subject most agreeable and entertaining to us, for
we ought to find nothing more delightful, than to
speak of him on whom we absolutely depend for
Life and Death; nothing is more just and necessary
since 'tis by this only that we can Execute our re∣membrance
of him, and our reverence towards
him.</P>
<P>There is nothing more reasonable than that, re∣ply'd
he; but are your opinions the same touching
this <HI>incomprehensible.</HI> There's a few, answered I, which
think not the same, in relation to Sovereign per∣fections.
<HI>Tell me possitively and clearly,</HI> said he, <HI>with
eagerness, what do your</HI> reasonings upon this Divine
Being liken him to? I confest sincerely that our o∣pinions
were divided in the conclusions which e∣very
one often drew from the same principles: this
causes many sharp <HI>contestations</HI> from whence there
often arises the most envenom'd Hatreds, and some∣times
even bloody Wars, and at other times Con∣sequences
no less fatal.</P>
<P>This good Old Man replyed very briskly,
that if <HI>I</HI> had made any other Answer, he
would have had no further Conference with
me, but should have had the greatest Contempt
for me; for, <HI>said he,</HI> 'tis most certain that
<HI>Men cannot speak of any thing thats incomprehen∣sible,
without having divers Opinions of it;</HI> nay
even such as are even contrary one to ano∣ther.
<PB N="83" REF="47"/>
One must be blind, <HI>added he,</HI> to be ig∣norant
of a first Principle, but one must be
<HI>Infinite like him,</HI> to be able to speak exactly
of it; for since we know it is Incomprehen∣sible,
it naturally follows, that we can only
speak of it by conjecture; and that all that
may be said on the Subject, may perhaps
content the Curious, but can never satisfy
the Reasonable Man. And we better approve of
an <HI>absolute silence in the Matter,</HI> than to expose
our selves by putting off a many false Notions
concerning the Nature of a Being, which is
elevated so very much above our Understand∣ings.
We Assemble therefore together in the
<HI>Hab,</HI> only to acknowledge his Supream great∣ness,
and adore his Soveraign Power, and leave
<HI>each Person to their liberty of thinking what they
please:</HI> But we have made an Inviolable Law,
never to speak of him, for fear of engaging
our selves by discourse in such Errors as
might offend him. I leave it to the Learned
to judge of a Conduct so extraordinary as
this is, <HI>never to speak in any manner of God.</HI>
All that I can say of it is, it impresses on the
Mind an admirable <HI>respect for Divine things,</HI> and
produces amongst us such an Union, of which
we meet with no Example any where else.
As I perceived the hour of <HI>Hab,</HI> would soon
oblige us to part, so I prest him the more
earnestly to tell me what were the Opinions
of the <HI>Australians</HI> concerning the <HI>Nature of
the Soul;</HI> wherefore he explain'd to me their
Notions upon this Subject, but he did it in
so elevated a manner, that I could retain but
little that he said to me of it, altho' whilst
he was speaking, I after some manner or other
apprehended all his Idea's.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="48"/>
The most essential of their Opinions touching
Matter, as near as I can remember, runs upon
the Doctrine of an <HI>Ʋniversal Genius,</HI> which com∣municates
it self in part to each particular per∣son,
and which has the Vertue when any one
dies, of preserving it self, until it be communicat∣ed
to another. So that this Genius is extinguish∣ed
by the death of any person, without being de∣stroy'd,
since it only waits for <HI>New Organs,</HI> and
the disposition of a new Machine to rekindle it
self, as I shall explain more at large, when I
shall speak of their Philosophy.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Opinion of the <HI>Australians</HI> touch∣ing
this Life.</HEAD>
<P>I Have only three things to remark upon the
Sentiments of the <HI>Australians</HI> concerning the
present Life: The first is in respect to the
beginning; the second, the continuation thereof;
and the third, the end. Their manner of re∣ceiving
Life, preserving and ending it.</P>
<P>I have already declared, in what manner the
<HI>Australians</HI> come into the world; but as it is one
of the principal points of this History, so I be∣lieve
my self obliged yet to say something more
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="48"/>
They have so great an aversion for whatso∣ever
regards the first beginning of their Lives,
that in a year or thereabouts after my arrival
amongst them, two of the Brethren having heard
me speak something of it, with-drew from me,
with as many signs of horrour, as if I had com∣mitted
some great Crime. One day when I had
discovered my self to my Old Philosopher, after
having censured me a little upon this Subject, he
entred into a long Discourse, and brought many
Proofs to oblige me to believe, that Children
grew within them like Fruits upon the Trees;
but when he saw all his reasons made no im∣pression
on my mind, and that I cou'd not for∣bear
smiling, he left me without accomplishing
it, reproaching me that my incredulity proceed∣ed
from the corruption of my manners.</P>
<P>It happen'd another time, about six months af∣ter
my arrival, that the extraordinary Caresses of
the Brethren, caused some unruly mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions in me,
which some of them perceiving, were so very much
scandaliz'd at it, that they left me with great in∣dignation:
Wherefore I soon became odious to
them all, as I have already said; and they had in∣fallibly
destroy'd me, had it not been for the par∣ticular
assistance of this good Old man.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, in about thirty two years that I
have lived with them, I cou'd never learn their way
of Generation; yet be it as it will, their Children
have neither the <HI>Meazles</HI> nor <HI>Small Pox,</HI> nor other
the like accidents, which the <HI>Europeans</HI> are subject
unto.</P>
<P>As soon as an <HI>Australian</HI> had conceived, he quits
his Apartment, and is carryed to the <HI>Hab,</HI> where he
<PB N="86" REF="49"/>
is received with Testimonys of an extraordinary
Bounty, and is nourished without being oblig'd to
work. They have a certain high place, upon which
they go to bring forth their Child, which is recei∣ved
upon certain <HI>Balsamick Leaves;</HI> after which the
Mother (or person that bore it) takes it and rubs
it with these Leaves, and gives it suck, without a∣ny
appearance of having suffer'd any pain.</P>
<P>They make no use of Swadling Cloaths, or Crad∣les.
The Milk it receives from the Mother, gives
it so good nourishment, that it suffices it without
any other food for two years: And the Excrements
it voids, are in so small a quantity, that it may al∣most
be said, it makes none. They generally speak
at eight months; they walk at a years end, and at
two they wean them. They begin to reason at
three; and as soon as the Mother quits them, the
first Master of the first Company teaches them to
read, and at the same time instructs them in the
first Elements of a more advanced knowledge. They
usually are three years under the Conduct of the
first Master, and after pass under the Discipline of
the second, who teaches them to write, with whom
they continue four years; and so with the others in
proportion, till they are thirty years of Age, at
which time they are perfect in all sorts of Sciences,
without observing any difference amongst them, ei∣ther
for Capacity, Genius, or Learning. When
they have thus accomplish'd the course of all their
Studies, they may be chose for Lieutenants, that is,
to supply the place of those that wou'd leave this
Life.</P>
<P>I have in the fifth Chapter spoken of their hum∣our,
which is mixt with a certain sweetness full of
Gravity, that forms the temperament of the most
reasonable men, and such as are the fittest for So∣ciety.
<PB N="87" REF="49"/>
They are strong, robust, and vigorous, and
their Health is never interrupted by the least sick∣ness.
This admirable Constitution comes without
doubt from their Birth and excellent Nourishment,
which they always take with moderation; for our
Sicknesses are always the consequences of the cor∣ruption
of that Blood whereof we are form'd, and
the excess of the ill Food which we are nourished
with. In fine, our Parents generally communicate
to us all the defects that they have contracted by
their irregular Lives; their Intemperance fills us
with such an abundance of superfluous Humours,
which destroy us how strong soever we may be, if
we purge not our selves often. It is the excessive
Heats that they kindle in their Blood by their De∣bauches,
which cause in us such Risings in the Flesh,
and all those scorbutick Distempers which spread
throughout the whole Body. Their Choller gives
us a disposition to the same Vice, their Wanton∣ness
augments our Concupiscence; in a word, they
make us just what we are, because they give us
what they have.</P>
<P>The <HI>Australians</HI> are exempted from all these
Passions; for their Parents never being subject to
them, cannot communicate 'em; and as they have
no principle of alteration, so they live in a kind of
indifference which they never forsake, except it
be to follow the motions that their reason impres∣ses
on them.</P>
<P>We may very near make the same consequences
touching the nourishment of the <HI>Australians;</HI> for if
the <HI>Europeans</HI> have the misfortune only to have
such Viands for their subsistence as are unhealthful,
it commonly happens, that they eat more than na∣ture
requires: and 'tis these excesses that cause in
them such weak Stomachs, Feavers, and other the
like Infirmities which are wholly unknown to the
<PB N="88" REF="50"/>
<HI>Australians.</HI> Their admirable Temperance, and
the goodness of their Fruits, upon which they live,
maintains them in such a frame of health, as is ne∣ver
interrupted by any Sickness: They are like∣wise
so far from placing any glory in Eating, or
making sumptuous Feasts as we do, that they
hide themselves, and only eat in secret; they sleep
very little, because they are persuaded, that Sleep
is too Animal an Action, from which man ought
if it was possible, wholly to abstain.</P>
<P>They all agree, that this Life is only a motion
full of trouble and agitation; they are persuaded,
that what we call Death is their Happiness, and that
the greatest good of Mankind is to arrive to this
term, which puts an end to all his pains: from
whence they are indifferent for life, and passion∣ately
wish for Death. The more I seem'd to ap∣prehend
Death, the more they were confirm'd in
the thought that I cou'd be no man, since accord∣ing
to their Ideas, I sinned against the <HI>first Princip∣les
of Reason.</HI> My Old man often times spoke to
me of it, and these are very near the same reasons
he gave me; <HI>We differ from Beasts,</HI> said he, <HI>in that
their Ʋnderstandings penetrate not into the bottom of
things, they judge of them only by Appearance and Cou∣lour.
'Tis from thence they fly their destruction, as the
greatest evil, and endeavour to preserve themselves as
the greatest Good, not considering that since 'tis an ab∣solute
necessity that they perish; all the pains they take to
prevent it, becomes vain and useless. Even to argue,</HI>
continued he, <HI>upon what regards us, it is necessary,
that we should consider Life as an Estate of Misery,
altho it consist in the union of a spiritual Soul with a
material Body, whereof the Inclinations are perfect∣ly
opposite the one to the other.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="50"/>
So that to desire to live, is to desire to be
always enduring the violent Shock of
these oppositions; and to desire Death, is
but to aspire to that Rest, which each of
those parts enjoys, when they are both
in their Center.</P>
<P>And, as we have nothing <HI>Dearer to us,
than our selves,</HI> added he, nor can look
upon our selves to be any thing else, but
so many Compounds, whose Dissolution
is certain and infallible, we more pro∣perly
<HI>languish than live;</HI> and the case
being so with us, would it not be better
for us not to be at all, than to be to no o∣ther
purpose, than to know, that shortly we
shall be no more? The care we take to
preserve our selves, is to no purpose,
since after all, we must die at last. The
consideration of our <HI>Rarest Talents,</HI> and
most exquisite improvements in Know∣ledge,
gives us a <HI>second torment,</HI> since we
can look upon them as no other, than
Transitory Enjoyments, whose acquisiti∣on
has cost us a Thousand pains, and yet,
whose loss it is no way in our power to
prevent. <HI>In fine,</HI> all that we reflect upon,
both <HI>within and without</HI> us, contributes to
render our Life so much the more odious
and insupportable to us.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="51"/>
I answered to all that, That in my opi∣nion,
these Arguments proved too much;
and that to give them their full force, it
weuld follow, that I must needs be sorry
for knowing any thing that surpasses my
Understanding, which yet is false, be∣cause
<HI>the goodness of Judgment consists in
being able to rest content with our condition,</HI>
and to put away those troublesome
Thoughts that serve only to afflict us,
especially when we know not how by any
means to remedy them. There is some∣thing
of Solidity in thy answer, reply∣ed
he; but yet it is weak in two particu∣lars:
The one is, in supposing we are
able to suspend our Judgment; and the
other, in thinking it possible we should
love our selves without detesting our Dis∣solution:
To be able to do the first, is
to be able, with open Eyes, not to see
what is continually before us; and to be
able to do the second, is, to love to be
something, without hating to be nothing.
'Tis a great weakness to imagine, we can
possibly live, without being deeply affect∣ed
with the Sense of our own Destructi∣on;
and 'tis still a greater to torment our
selves with the fear of what we know
will infallibly come upon us: But it is
the <HI>utmost degree of folly,</HI> to seek after pre∣servatives,
<PB N="99" REF="51"/>
in order to avoid what we
know to be absolutely inavoidable. To
be able to live without the Sense of
Death, is to be able to live without know∣ing
any thing of our selves, since Death
is inseparable from our Nature; and that
to consider our selves, in all our several
parts, is to see we have nothing but what
is mortal in us. To be capable of fearing
Death, supposes us able to reconcile two
Contradictions, since to fear, supposes
some doubt in us, whether what we fear
will happen or no, and that we certain∣ly
know we shall infallibly die, and it is
still more absurd to go about to take any
Preservatives, to prevent it, when we
know that to be impossible. I replied,
That we might justly fear, not Death it
self, but its Approaches; and that Preser∣vatives
were useful, because they might at
least stave it off from us for a while. Ve∣ry
good, replied he again, but dost thou
not see, that since the necessity of dying
is indispensible, and the putting it off for a
while, can be of no other service to us,
than to keep us the longer under conti∣nual
pain, grief, and anguish. I answer∣ed
him, that these Reasons would be of
much more weight among our <HI>Europeans,</HI>
than among them who know not what it
<PB N="100" REF="52"/>
is to suffer; whereas the Life of the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI>
was nothing else but a <HI>continued
Chain</HI> of Miseries and Sufferings.</P>
<P>How, says he, have you any other In∣firmities
than those of being <HI>Mortal,</HI> and
knowing your selves to be daily advan∣cing
towards Death? Yes, I assured him,
that our People commonly died <HI>many
Deaths,</HI> before they came to die for good
and all, and that Death came not upon
our <HI>Europeans,</HI> but by the Violence of
those Diseases that knockt them down,
and made them at last faint away under
them. This answer was to him a <HI>Myste∣ry:</HI>
And as I was endeavouring to make
him comprehend our <HI>Gouts,</HI> our <HI>Head∣aches,</HI>
and our <HI>Colicks;</HI> I found he under∣stood
me not, and therefore to make him
apprehend my meaning, I was forced
particularly to explain to him the Na∣ture
of some of those Diseases we suffer;
which assoon as he understood, <HI>Is it
possible,</HI> cried he, <HI>that any one should be in
love with such a Life as that?</HI> I answered,
that our People did not only love it, but
used all manner of means to prolong it;
from whence he took a fresh occasion to
condemn us, either for insensibility, or
extravagance, not being able, as he said,
to conceive how a reasonable Man that
<PB N="101" REF="52"/>
was assured of his Death, and that saw
himself daily dying, by several sorts of
Sufferings, and that could not protract
his Life, but in continual Languishment,
could possibly forbear desiring Death, as
his greatest happiness. Our opinions, in
this matter, are vastly different, says he,
from yours: For we, assoon as we come
to understand our selves, because we
think our selves obliged to love our own
selves, and look upon our selves, but as
so many <HI>Victims of a superiour Cause,</HI> that
is able every moment to destroy us, we
therefore make very small account of our
Life, and esteem it but as a <HI>Happiness,
which we can enjoy but as a Passenger,</HI> whilst
it is fleeting and passing from us. The
time in which we enjoy it, is bur∣thensome
to us, because it serves for no∣thing
but to raise in us a grief for the loss
of that happiness, which it more lightly
takes from us, than at first it gave it us.
In fine, We are weary of living, because
we durst not fix our <HI>Affection upon our selves
with all that tenderness,</HI> we might other∣wise
have, for fear of enduring too great
violences of Reluctance, when we shall
be forced to part from a being we have
so much doated on. To that I answer∣ed
him, That Reason teaches us, that it was

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="101" REF="53"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="102" REF="54"/>
<HI>always better to be, than not to be, and that
'twas better to live, tho' but for a day, than
never to live at all:</HI> To which he reply∣ed,
that we were to distinguish two things
in our Being; one was our general exi∣stence,
that perishes not, and the other
our particular Existence, or <HI>Individuality</HI>
that perishes. The first is indeed better
than privation, and that 'tis in that sense,
'tis true; that being is preferable before
not being; but that the second, <HI>viz.</HI> the
being of our <HI>Individuality,</HI> or particular be∣ing
is oftentimes worse than not being,
especially when tis accompanied with a
Knowledge that renders us unhappy. I an∣swered
again, that if being in general
were better than not being, it must needs
follow, That being likewise in particular,
was better than its Privation: But he sa∣tisfied
me, by proposing to me the very
State in which I had lately been. Tell
me, I prithee, says he, when thou consi∣deredst
thy condition in the place of
which thou toldst us, <HI>environned on all
sides by Death;</HI> could thou possibly esteem
thy Life at that time a Happiness, and
could thou value it better than nothing?
Is it not true, that the Knowledge thou
hadst, served then only to <HI>augment thy
misery?</HI> It is then to no purpose to main∣tain
<PB N="103" REF="54"/>
that Knowledge that afflicts me, is
not only no Happiness to me, but an
unhappiness so much the more sensible,
as I know it the more perfectly: It is
from <HI>that principle that flows our true Mi∣sery,</HI>
that we know what we are, and
what we must be, we know that we are
noble, and excellent beings: In a word,
worthy of an eternal Duration, and yet
we see that for all our Nobleness and Ex∣cellence,
we depend of a <HI>Thousand other
Creatures,</HI> that are inferiour to us, which
is the cause we look upon our selves, as
bweings that were brought up only to be
rendered so much the more unhappy,
and that it is which makes us chuse ra∣ther
<HI>not to be at all,</HI> than to be at the same
time so excellent, and so miserable.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Ancestors</HI> were so strongly perswa∣ded
of this Truth; that they <HI>sought Death
with the greatest passion</HI> in the World:
But because by that means our Country
begun to grow desolate, and dispeopled,
reasons were found out to perswade those
which remained, to spare themselves for
some time: for it was represented to
them, that so very <HI>fine and spacious a Coun∣try,</HI>
ought not to be left useless; that we
are an <HI>Ornament of the Universe,</HI> and
therefore ought to endure Life, tho' it
<PB N="104" REF="55"/>
were but to please that <HI>Soveraign Master</HI>
that gave it us. Upon which, some time
after, in order to Re-implace those that
had sought for Rest in a voluntary Death,
all that remained alive, obliged them∣selves
to present no less than <HI>three Children
to the Hebs;</HI> by which means, all the
Country being well Repeopled, an order
was published, that no Person should
have permission to go to his <HI>Long Rest,</HI>
but such a one who should present another
Man to the <HI>Heb,</HI> either his own Son, or
another, who was willing to be his Lieu∣tenant,
and to supply his place; and it
was oreered, at the same time, that none
should have the priviledge, neither to de∣mand
such a Permission, till he had liv∣ed
at least 100 Years, or could shew some
Wound that extreamly incommoded him.
Just as he had <HI>finished</HI> those words, we were
joyned by <HI>two Brethren,</HI> for which I was
very sorry, because I never found my
<HI>Old Man</HI> in so good a humour to discover
to me the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of all those things,
of which I demanded of him some Ex∣plication.</P>
<P>And now to proceed with our <HI>Narra∣tion,</HI>
there never is held any <HI>Assembly</HI> at the
<HI>Heb,</HI> at which there is not twenty
or thirty Persons that demand the Liber∣ty
<PB N="105" REF="55"/>
to return to their rest, and they never
refuse any, be they who they will, that
produce just Reasons for it: And when
any one has <HI>obtained Permission to go out of
this Life,</HI> he presents his Lieutenant, who
must be at least 36 years of age. The
Company receives him with Joy, and
gives him the Name of the <HI>old Man</HI> that
has a Mind to die; which done, they
represent to him the brave actions of his
Predecessors, and tell him they are con∣fident,
he will not degenerate from the ver∣tue
of him, whose place he is going to
supply. When that <HI>Ceremony</HI> is over, the
<HI>old Man</HI> goes merrily to the Table, fur∣nished
for that effect, with the <HI>Fruit of
Rest,</HI> where he eats to the number of
eight of them, with a smiling and calm
Countenance; when he has eaten <HI>Four</HI>
of them, his Heart begins to dilate, and
his Spleen to enlarge it self; so that the
extraordinary joy he feels within him,
makes him commit several extravagan∣cies,
as <HI>dancing, leaping,</HI> and <HI>talking</HI> all
manner of idle foolish things, which the
Brethren take no notice of, as coming
from a Man that has lost his reason: then
they present him two more, that quite di∣stract
his Brain; after which, his Lieute∣nant,
and another Person conduct him
<PB N="106" REF="56"/>
to the place, he before-hand chose for a
<HI>Sepulchre,</HI> where they give him two more
of the aforesaid Fruits, which plunge him
into an <HI>Eternal Sleep.</HI> Then they close up
his Tomb, and return back, beseeching
the <HI>Soveraign Being,</HI> to advance those hap∣py
Moments, in which they may have the
Priviledge to enjoy the <HI>like Rest</HI> with their
departed Brother. In this manner are
the <HI>Australians</HI> born, and thus they live
and die.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Exercises of the <HI>Australians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Australians</HI> reckon their Years
from the <HI>first point of the Solstice of
Capricorn,</HI> to the revolution of the same
Point, and they judge of it exactly by the
shadow of a Point fastned to a Wall, and
opposed directly to the <HI>South:</HI> And when
that Shadow is come to the lowest Point
in all their Appartments, then they know,
the Year is finished. From that Point to
the Equinox in <HI>March,</HI> they count a <HI>Sueb,</HI>
or Month; from that Equinox again to
the <HI>Solstice of</HI> Cancer, they count another
<PB N="107" REF="56"/>
Month; from that time to the other E∣quinox,
they count a third Month; and
their fourth Month extends from that
Equinox to the Solstice of <HI>Capricorn;</HI> so
that they have but <HI>four Months in the Year.</HI>
They call <HI>Suew</HI> what we call <HI>Weeks,</HI> and
reckon them by Moons; they divide the
Day (which they call <HI>Suec)</HI> into three
parts: The beginning of the Day they
call <HI>Mure;</HI> the middle part they call <HI>Dure,</HI>
and the latter part they call <HI>Spure.</HI> They
make no division of the Night, because
they pass it wholly in <HI>profound Sleep,</HI> which
they procure by eating some <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting Fruits</HI>
before they go to Sleep, which lay them
so fast, that nothing is able to wake them
so long as their Senses remain benummed
by the vertue of those Fruits. Their <HI>Mure</HI>
begins at Five in the Morning, and lasts
'till Ten; their <HI>Dure</HI> follows next, and
ends at Three in the Afternoon; and then
succeeds their <HI>Spure,</HI> which lasts 'till Eight
at Night. The first part of the Day is
employed for the <HI>Heb,</HI> and the Sciences;
the second for Work; and the third for
<HI>publick Exercise.</HI> They go the <HI>Heb</HI> every
five Days; and this is the order they ob∣serve
in it: The first Quarter passes the
<HI>Mure</HI> there, the second the <HI>Dure,</HI> and the
third the <HI>Spure.</HI> The second day, the
<PB N="108" REF="57"/>
fourth Quarter spends the <HI>Mure</HI> there, the
fifth the <HI>Dure,</HI> and the sixth the <HI>Spure.</HI> The
third day succeeds in the said three parts
of the day, the seventh, the eighth, and
the ninth; and the two following days
the rest of the Quarters in the same or∣der;
so that the sixth day the first Quar∣ter
begins again; not in the <HI>Mure,</HI> or Mor∣ning,
but in the <HI>Dure.</HI> By this means it
comes to pass, That there are always 400
Persons at the <HI>Hab,</HI> besides those of the
<HI>Hebs</HI> that follow their respective Quar∣ters.
Thus they pass one third part of the
Day in the <HI>Hab,</HI> without speaking one
Word, observing a steps distance between
person and person, and are all the while
so attentive upon what they are then think∣ing
upon, that nothing is able in the least
to distract their thoughts. I was told, They
formerly used to make some <HI>outward signs,</HI>
accompanied with wry Faces, and odd
postures of Body, but now they have
wholly abolish'd them, as unworthy of
reasonable men to do. Those days in
which they go not to the <HI>Hab,</HI> they are
obliged to be at the <HI>Heb,</HI> to treat <HI>of the
Sciences;</HI> which they do with an order and
method▪ most admirably plain, and per∣fectly
agreeing in all its parts. They pro∣pose
every one in their turn all their <HI>diffi∣culties,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="57"/>
which they maintain with pow∣erful
Reasons; after which, they answer
all the objections which their <HI>Antagonists</HI>
oppose against them. When the <HI>Dispute</HI>
is ended, they, if any thing of Impor∣tance
happen to have been proposed,
they write it into the <HI>publick Book,</HI> and
every one carefully sets it down too in
private. If any of them know any thing
that displeases him, or that he thinks
may be advantagious to his Country, he
proposes it to the Brethren, who take
such resolutions thereupon, as they judge
most reasonable, without aiming at any
thing but the publick Good.</P>
<P>They employ the next third part of
their Day in their Gardens, which they
cultivate with such art and skill, as is un∣known
in <HI>Europe.</HI> They know how to
give such an agreeable sweetness to their
Fruits, by watering their Trees with cer∣tain
Liquors, that nothing can be eaten
more delicious than they. Their <HI>Flower-Pots</HI>
are enamell'd with a thousand sorts
of Flowers, of different beauties, that
seem to vie with one another in fineness
and variety of colours, and in the charms
of their perfuming smells. Their Walks
are longer than the Sight can reach, and
so neatly ordered, that nothing of that
<PB N="110" REF="58"/>
nature can be more compleat. The whole
is cut through in all convenient places
with a thousand different sorts of Water-Works,
which are made into <HI>Basons,
Chanels, Cascades,</HI> and all that Art can
invent for the pleasure of the Senses, that
those Gardens are thereby made such
really, as we fancy them to be sometimes
in Idea, when we let our Imagination
follow the dictates of our luxurious de∣sires.</P>
<P>The last third part of their Day is al∣lotted
for three sorts of very diverting Ex∣ercises;
the first consists in producing
what they have newly invented, or re∣peating
the Experiments of what they
had already shewn; but there seldom
passes a day but they propose some new
Invention, upon which they always take
care to Register the Name of the Inven∣tor
in their Book of publick Curiosities,
which they esteem one of the greatest ho∣nours
can be done them; and in 32 years
time, I observed above 5000 of these
new Inventions Recorded, that would
pass for so many Prodigies among us.</P>
<P>Their second Exercise consists in mana∣ging
two sorts of Arms, one of which is
very like our Halberds, and the other re∣sembles
much our Organ-Pipes. They use
<PB N="111" REF="58"/>
the former with great agility, but yet not
with altogether so much dexterity as our
<HI>Europeans.</HI> Their Halberts are so massie
and strong, that they will easily run
through the bodies of six Men, one be∣hind
another. They are made of six
pieces of Wood, seasoned with Sea-water,
impregnated with some certain Drugs,
which render them very hard, and yet
very light. The other Arms which I have
compared to our Organ-Pipes, are com∣posed
of ten or twelve Pipes, which are
furnished with certain Springs at one end,
which being let go, discharge Bullets
with so great a force, that they pierce
through the bodies of six Men, one after
another, at one shot, the action of which
Spring is so quick and rapid, that 'tis im∣possible
to fence off its blow, but men find
themselves shot before they are aware
they were aimed at.</P>
<P>As for their Halberts they exercise
them in throwing thirty or forty Paces,
and that so dextrously, that in fifteen
throws they seldom miss twice of their
mark. But their Strength is much more
prodigious than their Art, for they
carry, without straining themselves, to
the weight of six or seven <HI>Quintals,</HI> or
hundred weight; and pull up Trees by
<PB N="112" REF="59"/>
the Roots, which we could hardly shake;
&amp; I saw one of them, that after he had run
through, with his Halbert, four half men,
as they call us, carried them afterwards
upon one of his Shoulders, hanging upon
his Halbert, two before, and two be∣hind.</P>
<P>Their third Exercise consists in throw∣ing
certain Balls, of three or four different
sizes, some of which they throw up into
the Air, and some at Butts, or Marks;
those which they cast into the Air, to be
well thrown, must hit one another in a
certain point mark'd out; and those which
are cast against Butts, must pass through
a hole in the said Butt, which they will
often do ten or twelve times together.
And that which is most to be remarked
in these Exercises, is, that they perform
them with much briskness and gayety,
which yet is tempered with a certain Air
of Gravity and Majesty, without any dis∣order
or discomposure of mind. The
Balls they throw one at another, are like
our <HI>Tennis-Balls,</HI> but softer, and less dan∣gerous:
and the Art of him that throws
them consists in hitting him against whom
he plays: and his Adversary on the other
side, places all his skill in avoiding the
stroke aimed at him; and the pleasure of
<PB N="113" REF="59"/>
seeing them is so great, that there is no∣thing
but People will quit, to go to see such
a Divertisement. For sometimes they ca∣pringly
leap backward, to let the Ball pass
by them, and sometimes they turn and
bend their bodies so many-several ways,
that there is no Rope-Dancer or Tumbler
among us can come near them for agility.
When he that throws the Ball, lets flie 3 or
4, one after another, it is an admirable
thing to see the dextrous behaviour of him
against whom they are directed, who
stoops to avoid the one, bends himself to
escape another, receives and throws back
the third and the fourth with his-hands,
and sometimes with his feet; which several
actions he performs almost all in the same
instant; because all the Balls being always
thrown very straight, it necessarily hapens,
either that all of them hit, or that he at
whom they are aimed must use an extra∣ordinary
dexterity in avoiding, or putting
them by. I was counted very dextrous in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> but yet I seemed very unhandy
among the <HI>Australians;</HI> and had I not pre∣tended
an excuse, by reason of the wounds
I had received, I should have made them
think my Nation to be very dull and un∣active
People.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the <HI>Australian</HI> Language, and of
the Studies of the <HI>Australians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Australians</HI> have three ways of
expressing themselves, as we have in
<HI>Europe,</HI> that is, by <HI>Voice,</HI> by <HI>Signs,</HI> and by
<HI>Writing.</HI> Among these, <HI>Signs</HI> are most fa∣miliar
with them; and I have observed
them to converse together several hours,
without declaring their minds any other
way than that. They never speak but
when it is necessary to make continued
Discourses, and to express a long Series
of Propositions: All their Words are <HI>Mo∣nosyllables,</HI>
and they have but one <HI>Conju∣gation;</HI>
as for Example, <HI>Af,</HI> signifies to
Love; which is thus conjugated in the
<HI>Present Tense, La, Pa, Ma, i. e.</HI> I Love,
thou Lovest, he Loves: <HI>Lla, Ppa, Mma;</HI>
we Love, you Love, they Love. They
have but one <HI>Tense</HI> for the time past, <HI>Lga,
Pga, Mga, i. e.</HI> I have Loved, thou hast
Loved, he has Loved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Future</HI> is,
<HI>Lda, Pda, Mda,</HI> I shall, or will Love, <HI>&amp;c.
Llda, Ppda, Mmda,</HI> we shall, or will
Love, <HI>&amp;c. Uf</HI> in the <HI>Astralian</HI> Tongue sig∣nifies
<PB N="115" REF="60"/>
to work, which they conjugate thus,
<HI>Lu, Pu, Mu,</HI> I work, thou workest, <HI>&amp;c.
Lgu, Pgu, Mgu,</HI> we Work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so
in the other Tenses.</P>
<P>They have no Declensions, nor Arti∣cles,
and but very few Nouns: They ex∣press
simple substances by one single Vow∣el,
and Compound Bodies, by the Vow∣els
that signifie the chief Elements, of
which they are composed. They own
but five simple Bodies or Elements, of
which the first and noblest in their esteem
is the Fire, which they express by the sin∣gle
Vowel <HI>A,</HI> the second is the Air, which
they call <HI>E,</HI> the third is Salt, which
they call <HI>G,</HI> the fourth is Water, which
they call <HI>I,</HI> and the fifth is Earth, which
they call <HI>U.</HI></P>
<P>All their Adjectives and their Epithets
are expressed by so many single Conso∣nants,
of which they have a greater number
than the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Every Consonant sig∣nifies
a Quality that belongs to the things
signified by the Vowels: Thus <HI>B</HI> signi∣fies
Clear, <HI>C</HI> Hot, <HI>D</HI> Disagreeable, <HI>F</HI> Dry:
and by these Explications they so perfect∣ly
from their words, that assoon as a
Man hears them pronounced, he pre∣sently
conceives the nature of things they
signifie; as for example, they call the

Stars <HI>AeB,</HI> a word which signifies in one
Breath, the two chief Elements, or simple
Bodies, of which they are composed, and
withal, that they are Luminous. They call
the Sun <HI>Aab,</HI> the Birds <HI>Oef,</HI> which signifies at
once, that they are composed of a dry,
salt and airy substance. They call a Man
<HI>Vez,</HI> which signifies a substance, partly
airy, and partly Earthy, tempered with
some moisture; the same method they
observe in the composition of other
Names. The advantage of this way of
speaking is, that by this means a Man be∣comes
a Philosopher, by learning the first
words he pronounces, and that one can
name nothing at the same time, which
would pass for a miraculous thing with
any one that knew not their Alphabet,
nor the composition of their words.</P>
<P>And if their way of speaking be admi∣rable,
their method of writing is much
more: they use only points to express
their Vowels, which points are distin∣guish'd
only by their Situation. They
have Five places for them, the uppermost
signifying <HI>A,</HI> the second <HI>E,</HI> and so for∣ward.
As for example.</P>
<P>A, E, I, O, U.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="61"/>
And though it seems to us very difficult
to distinguish them, yet use has made it
very easie to them: they have 36 Conso∣nants,
24 of which are remarkable; they
are little strokes that are made round
about the points, and signifie according
to the order of their several places; as for
example, <HI>E B</HI> signifies clear Air, <HI>I C</HI> Hot
Water, <HI>I X</HI> Cold Water, <HI>U L</HI> Moist
Earth, <HI>A F</HI> Dry fire, <HI>E S</HI> White Air,
and so all the rest: they have about 18
or 19 more, which we have no Conso∣nants
in <HI>Europe</HI> that can express.</P>
<P>The more we consider that way of
writing, the more secrets we shall find
in it to admire. <HI>B</HI> signifies clear, or bright,
<HI>C</HI> hot, <HI>X</HI> cold, <HI>L</HI> moist, <HI>F</HI> dry, <HI>S</HI> white,
<HI>N</HI> black, <HI>T</HI> green, <HI>D</HI> disagreeable, <HI>P</HI> sweet,
<HI>Q</HI> pleasant, <HI>R</HI> bitter, <HI>M</HI> desirable, <HI>G</HI> evil,
<HI>Z</HI> high, <HI>H</HI> low, J consonant red, <HI>A</HI> join'd
with 2, peaceable. Thus assoon as they
hear, or pronounce a word, they appre∣hend
at the same time the nature of the
thing signified by it; as when they write
this word <HI>Ipin,</HI> they presently understand
by it an Apple, both sweet and delicious,
and <HI>Izd,</HI> a bad and disagreeable Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
When they teach a Child, they explain
to him all the Elements, and the nature
of all things signified by the words he
<PB N="118" REF="62"/>
pronounces. Which is of wonderful ad∣vantage,
as well to the publick, as to par∣ticular
persons: because as soon as they
know how to read, which is commonly
at three years old, they apprehend at the
same time the Properties of all manner of
Beings. They attain to perfection in rea∣ding
at ten years; and are skilled in all
the Secrets of their Letters at fourteen.
They understand all the difficulties of Phi∣losophy
at twenty, and from twenty, to
twenty five, they apply themselves to the
contemplation of the Stars; and they di∣vide
that Study into three parts; the first
concerns the Revolution of the Stars, the
second, their distinction, and the third,
their qualities, with their Reasonings
thereupon, which are quite different from
those of our <HI>Europeans,</HI> upon that Subject.
But this being a Matter purely Philosophi∣cal,
it is no proper place here to enter into
any particular explication of it.</P>
<P>From twenty five till twenty eight
years of Age, they imploy themselves in
studying the History of their Country;
and 'tis only in that one point they shew
a weakness of mind, like to that of other
People, as well in respect of the great
Antiquity to which they extend their
Original, as of the fabulous things they
<PB N="119" REF="62"/>
relate of the first Men from which they
pretend themselves descended. For they
count above 12000 Revolutions of Sol∣stices
since the beginning of their Re∣publick.
They pretend to derive their O∣riginal
from <HI>HAAB,</HI> that is, a God, who,
they say, produced three Men, from
whom all the rest descended. They have
some Records written upon old Barks of
Trees, that contain 8000 Revolutions of
their History, which are written in the
form of Annals; the rest is comprehen∣ded
in 48 Volumes, of a prodigious big∣ness;
but all that is reported in them, has
more of the appearance of Romantick
Prodigies, than of real historical Events,
and is more wonderful than credible. For
if all they relate be true, the Stars are
multiplied by two thirds more than they
were at first; the Sun grown bigger by
one half; and the Moon on the contrary,
shrunk much less; the Sea has changed
its place; and a thousand other like things
have happened contrary to all appearance
of probability.</P>
<P>As for us <HI>Europeans,</HI> and the rest of
Mankind, they make our Race to begin
not 'till 5000 Revolutions after them, and
the Original which they give us, is alto∣gether
<PB N="120" REF="63"/>
Ridiculous; for they Report, <HI>That
a Serpent of an unmeasurable bigness, and of
an amphibious nature, which they call</HI> Ams,
<HI>throwing himself upon a Woman, while she
was asleep, and having enjoyed her, without
doing her any other mischief, the Woman
waking towards the end of the action, was
struck with such a horror at it, that in a
fright she threw her self into the Sea; but that
the Serpent leaping in after her, swam by her,
and keeping her above water, carried her to a
neighbouring Island, where the Woman re∣covering
her fright, and being moved with
the strange friendship shown her by that Ani∣mal,
repented of her despair, and was wrought
upon to use all endeavours to preserve her life,
and accordingly sought about that Desart for
all that might contribute to her Nourishment;
and the Serpent on his side, brought her all he
could find. At last this Woman was deli∣vered
of two Children, the one a Boy, and the
other a Girl. Upon which the Serpent re∣doubled
bis care, and never ceased going up
and down to look for Provisions to feed the
Mother and the Children; and when he could
not meet with the Fruits which they ordinarily
fed upon, he would take Fish, and sometimes
small Animals▪ and bring them to eat. But
as those Children grew up, they shewed every
day more and more visible marks of malice</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="63"/>
<HI>and brutality, which so grieved the Mother,
that nothing could appease her sorrow. The
Serpent thereupon taking notice of her trouble,
and thinking she pined after her own Country,
after he had endeavoured to comfort ber with∣out
any effect, he made her understand by
signs, that if she had a mind to return to her
own Country People, he was ready to assist
her in her return, as he had done in bringing
her where she was now. Upon this, the Wo∣man
threw her self into the Water, more out
of design to try the good will of the Serpent,
than out of any other motive; at the same in∣stant
the Serpent leapt after, and holding her
fast imbraced under him, carried her back
in a few hours into her own Country; after
which he return<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d back to his two young Chil∣dren,
who when they were grown up, coupled
together, and multiplied to a great number,
living only by Hunting and Fishing▪ like▪ Beasts
of Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: And when the Island, hy this means,
grew over-stock'd with People, they found out
a way to transport themselves into▪ other
Countries, and to fill them with their Pro∣ductions,
together with all those disorderly
qualities▪ and their pernicious effects, that are
experienced in all Countries peopled by that
Serpentine Race.</HI> And this is the goodly
Pedigree the <HI>Australians</HI> are pleased to
give us; but to return to them.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="64"/>
When they come to the Age of thirty
years, they are priviledged to argue upon
all sorts of Subjects, excepting that of
<HI>Haab,</HI> that is, GOD: When they are
thirty five years old, they are capable of
being made Lieutenants in their <HI>Hebs,</HI> and
to make a body of a Family with their
Brethren, in a separate Apartment; af∣ter
twenty five years more, they may re∣turn
to the <HI>Heb,</HI> to assist in the instructi∣on

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the living Creatures, or Animals, of
the <HI>Southern World.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is none that are but never so
little versed in the knowledge of
Foreign Countries, but knows there are
some peculiar Animals in them as diffe∣rent
from those of other Regions, as the
Lands that bear them. As for Example,
<HI>England</HI> breeds no Wolves; nor can any
<PB N="123" REF="64"/>
Serpents live in <HI>Ireland,</HI> let them be tran∣sported
from what other place soever.
The Woods and Forests of the same
Country are infested neither with Worms
nor Spiders. The Isles of the <HI>Orcades</HI> have
no Flies; <HI>Candia</HI> has no venemous Crea∣tures;
and Poison it self, when transpor∣ted
into the Isles of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> loses its
venome, and is no longer mortal when
in those Countries.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the biggest Animals
are not always the most hurtful; and
those small Vermine, which the <HI>Austra∣lians</HI>
can hardly tell how to conceive,
though they have nothing rare in them
but their life, yet do so much mischief in
divers parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that they often
cause Famine, Plague, and other consi∣derable
Calamities, as might be proved
by infinite number of experiences; for
which reason I must needs reckon it to
be one of the greatest happinesses of the
<HI>Australians,</HI> that they are exempted from
all manner of Insects. There is not to be
found any venomous Beast in all their
Countrey; and therefore they often lie
down, and sleep on the bare ground, not
only without any danger, but with great
pleasure: And 'tis from thence they like∣wise
gather a great part of those fair and
<PB N="124" REF="65"/>
delicious Fruits that there abound. They
used for a long time, to keep three sorts
of four-footed Beasts, and they still keep
so many sorts in several parts: The least
of them may be compared to our Apes,
but their Faces are not hairy, their Eyes are
even with their Head, their Ears are pretty
long, and their Mouth and Nose are like a
Man's. They have longer Claws than other
Apes, with five Fingers each▪ with which
they hold and carry what they will, with
as much ease and dexterity as Men. They
are very active, and turn their bodies in∣to
a great many postures, that require as
much dexterity as agility: The love they
have to Men is so great, that they will
starve themselves, and die for grief, if
they be separated from them. When
they are in the presence of any Man, they
never cease giving him all the divertise∣ment
they can, by their various Motions
and Postures. They are now banisht out
of a great many <HI>Sezains,</HI> because they
were too troublesome, and particularly in
their Religious Assembly in the <HI>HAB;</HI>
for as they could not keep them from go∣ing
thither without locking them up, and
running the risk of finding them dead with
pining, when they came home; so on the
other side, they could not let them go thi∣ther,
<PB N="125" REF="65"/>
without exposing themselves to be
continually disturbed at their devout Con∣templations,
and without a visible Pro∣fanation
of so venerable a place. The A∣nimals
of the second sort, are something
like our Hogs, save only that their Hair
is as soft as Silk, and their Snouts are long∣er
by half than those of Swine. They
call them Hums; they have the instinct
to work, and turn up the Earth in right
lines, with as much, or more dexterity
than our best Husbandmen, and have no
need of any Leader, to guide them in
beginning, continuing, and ending their
furrows; yet they have destroyed them
in most of the <HI>Sezains,</HI> because of the na∣stiness
they fill all places with, and because
they are useful but seven or eight days in
a year; and that they must be kept shut
up all the rest of the year, to prevent the
dammages, and distastful annoyances they
will otherwise cause.</P>
<P>The third sort of Animals are like our
<HI>Dromedaries,</HI> save only that their Heads
are more like those of Horses, their Back∣bones
are sunk inwards their whole length,
and the Birds that are raised above it, form
a kind of Heart, whose point is turned
downwards, in the upper hollow of which,
two Men may easily lie down; these
<PB N="126" REF="66"/>
Beasts are called <HI>Suefs,</HI> and will carry
with ease eight Men of that Country, that
weigh at least as much as twelve <HI>Europeans,</HI>
and they are used likewise for the carriage
of heavy Burdens, and of such things as
are most necessary in the Commerce of
Life.</P>
<P>Besides these Animals, there are four
sorts of Birds, which well deserve our
Reflection; the first are called <HI>Effs,</HI> who
flutter about like tame Hens, and are a∣bout
their bigness; they are of a charm∣ing
Carnation Colour, however they be∣gin
now to banish them out of the <HI>Sezains,</HI>
because they do a great deal of mischief
in the Flower-pots and Gardens.</P>
<P>The second and third sorts are like
our <HI>Tom-Tits,</HI> and <HI>Yellow-Hammers,</HI> but a
little bigger; and so tame, that they are
often fain to drive them away forcibly off
from Peoples bodies; and their Voices
are so sweet, that they are preferred be∣fore
the sweetest Consorts of Musick;
they flutter about the Brethren, and fol∣low
them every where; they go into the
very <HI>Hab,</HI> where they cause a certain
chearfulness and calmness of Spirit, by
their chirping, which they call <HI>Pacd,</HI>
that is to say, Divertisement of Blessed∣ness:
They never eat but with the Bre∣thren,
<PB N="127" REF="66"/>
nor take any rest but when they
are perched somewhere upon them.
And they have this property, that they
smell the Birds of Prey at a great distance,
and peck the Brethren to give them no∣tice
of it. The fourth sort of Birds are a∣bout
the bigness of our <HI>Oxen;</HI> they have
a long-pointed Head, and a Bill of a full
foot long, and sharper than a <HI>Razor;</HI> they
have right <HI>Bullocks</HI> Eyes standing out of
their Heads, two great Ears, Red and
White Feathers, a Neck, not slender, but
very large, a Body twelve Foot long, and
four Foot broad, with a Tale turning up,
and furnished with long Feathers, a Sto∣mach
under their Feathers as hard as Iron,
and of proof against all blows; and last∣ly,
they have Feet, rather slender than
thick, that are armed with five horrible
Talons, strong enough to hold and carry
off with ease 300 weight: These horri∣ble
Birds are called <HI>Urgs,</HI> and live only by
Prey. And accordingly at certain set sea∣sons,
they make so cruel a War upon the <HI>Au∣stralians,</HI>
that they sometimes carry off 4 or
500 of them in a day: Assoon as they
have tasted of Man's flesh, their Greedi∣ness
after it so mightily encreases, that
they omit no Stratagem or Invention to
get more of it; for sometimes they place
<PB N="128" REF="67"/>
themselves down from the middle Region
of the Air twelve or fourteen of them to∣gether,
and throwing themselves cross the
Arms of the <HI>Australians,</HI> seldom fail to car∣ry
off every one his Man. As these Ani∣mals
are the greatest Enemies the <HI>Austra∣lians</HI>
have, they have used, and still daily
use incredible Endeavours to exterminate
them, so far as to have destroyed whole
Islands of 30, and 35 Leagues compass,
and raised Mountains of a League high,
to drive them away: but in spight of all
they have yet done, or can do, I see no
likelihood they will ever be able to se∣cure
themselves from them: For the
Islands where they harbour are so nume∣rous
in that Country, and are so full of
such vastly high Rocks, that it is impos∣sible
ever to destroy them: But we shall
speak more amply of these Birds in the
next Chapter.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear telling you here, that
the <HI>Australians</HI> are so far from eating flesh,
that they cannot conceive how any Man
can find in his Heart to do it; the rea∣sons
they alledge for it, are, first, that sort
of Nourishment cannot agree with Hu∣manity,
that ought naturally to be averse
from all cruelty: secondly, because the
flesh of Animals very much resembling
<PB N="129" REF="67"/>
that of Men, it follows, that they which
can have the Stomach to eat of the flesh
of the former, will easily be induced to
eat without difficulty of the latter two:
thirdly, because the digestion of it is dan∣gerous,
and we cannot eat the flesh of an
Animal, without contracting some of its
Inclinations: fourthly, because the flesh
of a Brute is so modified for that Brute's
Nature, that we cannot eat of it, without
becoming proportionably more or less
like that Brute, as we eat more or less of
its flesh: fifthly, because a Beast is a thing
so much beneath us, that it were better
for a Man not to be at all, than to debase
his noble nature, so far as to adulterate
it with the mixture of that of a Beast, by
making it his Food. The <HI>Australians</HI>
likewise hate Fish, no less than Land-Creatures,
and there are but very few to
be seen in their Seas or Rivers, because
the Birds of Prey we just now mentioned,
feed upon them, and make a continual
War upon them: And for my part I ne∣ver
eat any other Fish there but a certain
sort of <HI>Eels</HI> of three or four Ells long, and
some small finny-footed Creature, like
our <HI>Hedge hoggs,</HI> of a Colour as black as
Ebony.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some rare Commodities in <HI>Australia,</HI>
or the <HI>Southern World,</HI> that might
be useful to <HI>Europe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THey are in a great error that think
<HI>Europe</HI> to be a Country that has no
need of its Neighbours; the new Com∣modities
which we have received by our
Commerce with <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America</HI> since
this last hundred years, are a certain proof
of it; and it is not to be doubted, but if
we could have the like Traffick with the
<HI>Australians▪</HI> we should still gain more
considerable advantages than by any o∣ther
known Commerce. I shall only men∣tion
four of those advantages which we
should infallibly reap by such a Trade.</P>
<P>Among the Beasts that I have descri∣bed,
the <HI>Hums</HI> would render us inestima∣ble
Service, because they would ease our
men of the extraordinary pains they are
fain to take in digging and plowing up
the Earth; but the <HI>Suefs</HI> would prove
still much more profitable to us than they,
for they are Beasts more gentle and tra∣ctable
than Oxen, and may be kept so
<PB N="131" REF="68"/>
cheap, that two pounds of Grass or Herbs
will keep one of them three Days. They
can endure a whole Day without eating,
and in the most difficult Journies, they
will travel 18 or 20 Leagues out-right,
without any need of stopping to bait. It
is easie to guess what profit the Merchants
would get by these Creatures, for they
would not need to be at the tenth part
of the charge they now are at for the
carriage of their Goods, two of these A∣nimals
being able to carry as much as a
large Waggon drawn by six Horses. The
<HI>Australians,</HI> that have no need of any
Traffick, are excusable for making no
more account of these Beasts, but the
<HI>Europeans</HI> would find it worth their while
to get some of them brought over, what∣ever
price they cost. But yet all this is no∣thing
to the gain the <HI>Europeans</HI> might draw
from those Birds of Prey of which I have
spoken; for those Birds, though they are
very cruel when wild, yet may be tamed,
and made as gentle as any of our most
<HI>domestick Animals.</HI> When I came first in∣to
<HI>Australia,</HI> they had one of them which
they kept in one of the <HI>Sezains,</HI> that car∣ried
a Man on his back with more ease
than a <HI>Spanish Courser.</HI> They are to be
mounted behind their Wings, and the
<PB N="132" REF="69"/>
Feathers on their Back supply the place of
a very commodious Cushion; and in∣stead
of a Bridle, one need but tie a
piece of Whipcord about their Bills, with
which one may guide them whither and
how one pleases. In this manner a man
may travel forty or fifty Leagues out right,
and then after about two Hours resting to
bait, he may go as many more; and so
he may easily travel 100 Leagues a day,
without any incommodity, without fear,
without danger, and without being trou∣bled
with the opposition of Rivers, Woods,
Mountains, or any other obstacle, or ill
rencounter in his way. But two Reasons,
however, obliged the <HI>Australians</HI> to leave
off the use of them, which would be of
no force in <HI>Europe.</HI> The first, is because
those Birds are extremely hot with Lust,
after carnal Conjunction, which was the
cause that sometimes they would carry
their <HI>Australian</HI> Riders into some <HI>Island,</HI>
where they smelt a Female of their kind,
where they were devoured by the wild
Birds. The second, was because they
were persuaded, that the tame Birds of
that kind were the chief occasion that en∣ticed
the wild ones to come in such num∣bers
into their Country, where they made
such havock. Which considerations could
<PB N="133" REF="69"/>
have no place in our <HI>Northern Countries,</HI>
whither none would be transported but
tame ones, and where there would be no
wild ones at all.</P>
<P>These are the most considerable Re∣marks
I have made upon the Animals of
the <HI>Southern Countries.</HI> Next, as for the
Fruits it bears, they surpass all imagina∣tion
in beauty and deliciousness: The
Fruit▪ which they call <HI>the Fruit of Rest,
or Repose,</HI> is indued with some properties
that to us would appear miraculous. Its
faculty in procuring Rest when we please,
and the vertue of its Juice in healing, in
very little time, all manner of wounds,
induce me to believe there's no Ail, or Di∣stemper
in <HI>Europe,</HI> for which it would not
prove a soveraign Remedy. I was infor∣med
afterward, that it was with that all
my wounds were cured, I had received
at my coming; and though I afterward
received in several Fights many sore blows
more, some whereof made great wounds
in my body and some broke and shattered
my bones, yet by vertue of that only
Juice, I was always cured in three days▪
which if known, and used in <HI>Europe,</HI> would
cut short <HI>that numherless number of Drugs
and Remedies,</HI> that cost so dear among us,
<PB N="134" REF="70"/>
and which yet after all, <HI>kill more Patients
than they cure.</HI></P>
<P>While I lived in <HI>Portugal,</HI> I was subject
to several Infirmities, and the terrible
shocks I had suffered by my disasters up∣on
the Sea, had very much weakned me;
and yet when I came into <HI>Australia,</HI> and
began to live upon the Fruits of the
Earth, that are the only Food there, I
can boldly affirm, That I felt not the
least Indisposition, nor Infirmity; and tho'
my absence at such a dreadful distance
from my own Country, and the extra∣ordinary
odd and strange Customs of the
People I conversed with, and which I
was obliged to conform to, gave me no
small cause to be <HI>Melancholick,</HI> and tor∣mented
me with many a bitter reflection,
yet as soon as I tasted but one of the <HI>Fruits
of Repose,</HI> all my Resentments were calm∣ed,
and my Courage and usual briskness
came to me again, my Blood danced in
my Veins, and I found my self in such a
disposition both of body and mind, that
there was nothing I could desire to ren∣der
my Contentment more compleat than
it was. Of what inestimable price would
such <HI>Fruits</HI> be in <HI>Europe,</HI> where grief and
vexation kill the greatest part of mankind,
<PB N="135" REF="70"/>
and troubles cause languishments far
worse, and far more formidable than
Death.</P>
<P>But can there be any thing imagined
more desirable, than to live splendidly
and fare very delicately, without being
at any charge, since for that end, one
need not have any greater Provision than
three or four of those Fruits, which are
incomparably more delicate, and of a
much richer Relish and Nourishment,
than our most succulent Meats, and
most artfully seasoned Dishes, nor any o∣ther
Drink, than a sort of natural <HI>Nectar,</HI>
that is found running in streams in that
Country, where every one may eat and
drink his fill, with the greatest Pleasure
in the World, without being obliged, ei∣ther
to Till the Earth, or cultivate any
Trees.</P>
<P>I have admired an hundred times how
Nature comes to be so partially liberal to
that Country, to give away as 'twere in
sporting, and with a careless prodigality
those things she is so nigardly of in our
Regions. But among other things, I
cannot pass in silence, that abundance of
fine Crystal that is there to be found,
and which the <HI>Australians</HI> know how,
with such admirable Skill and Symmetry
<PB N="136" REF="71"/>
to cut, and put together, that it is very
hard to find where the Stones joyn, so
exactly they seem to be all of a piece.
This Crystal is so transparent, that 'twere
impossible to distinguish any Po<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in it,
if the rich Figures Nature forms in it of di∣vers
colours, did not convince us it had
some.</P>
<P>But that, which in my Opinion surpas∣ses
all the most prodigious Rarities in the
World, is a <HI>Hab,</HI> which is to be seen in
the <HI>Seizain,</HI> or district of <HI>Haf▪</HI> which is
made all out of one entire piece of Cry∣stal,
which could not be done, but by
cutting it out of a great Rock of the
same matter. This wonderful <HI>Hab▪</HI> or
<HI>Temple,</HI> surpasses all the rest in height and
breadth; for it is 200 Foot high, and 150
Foot wide; the Figures with which this
Crystal is interspersed, are bigger than
those observed in the other, and it is vi∣sible
that they are all entire, without be∣ing
patched up with any inlaid pieces:
They assured me, that it had been oftentimes
debated among them, whether it
would not be better to destroy it, than
to keep it standing, because it tempts the
curiosity of those that dwell afar off, and
causes distraction of Thoughts in them
that assemble in it: However it is yet
<PB N="137" REF="71"/>
standing, and I can hardly believe that
ever they can find in their Hearts' to vote
the demolition of so rich and rare a
piece as that.</P>
<P>The greatest difficulty I find in procu∣ring
a Traffick in these Commodities be∣tween
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Australia,</HI> consists in
finding out some way, either to force, or
otherwise to dispose of such a Communi∣cation;
for after having well considered
the whole matter, there appear to me
unsurmountable difficulties in such an en∣terprise;
for the <HI>Australians</HI> being a Peo∣ple
that neither cover any thing; there is
no likelihood of bringing them to a Com∣pliance,
by the allurements of Gain, of
Rewards, or of Pleasure, nor any practi∣cable
means left for us to overcome that
strange aversion they have for us, which
is so great, that they cannot endure to
hear us mentioned▪ without declaring the
passion they have to destroy us. And
then besides all those things that we usual∣ly
carry into the new discovered Coun∣tries,
and which procures us access to their
Inhabitants, pass in the esteem of the <HI>Au∣stralians,</HI>
for Childrens Play-things, and
meer trifles, and bawbles; they look up∣on
our Gawdy Stuffs, and richest Silks,
as Spiders Webs, they know not so much
<PB N="138" REF="72"/>
as what the names of Gold or Silver signi∣fie;
and in a word, all that we count
precious appear in their esteem to be but
ridiculous; and therefore there remains
no other way to introduce our selves a∣mong
them, but by open force; and in
that matter they have a great advantage
over us, which would frustrate all our
attempts that way; for the Sea in those
parts is so very shallow, that it will hard∣ly
carry a Boat, at two or three Leagues
distance from their Shoars, unless it be in
certain particular <HI>Creeks,</HI> where there are
some Veins of Water which cannot be
known, but by long experience. Besides
all which obstacles, they keep so exact a
Guard upon all their Coasts, that it is im∣possible
to surprise them, nor yet to attack
them with any hopes of Success, as will
appear by the following Relation of some
of their Wars.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ordinary Wars of the <HI>Austra∣lians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is by a constant <HI>Decree</HI> establish'd in
the World, that we should possess no
happiness without some pains, nor be able
to keep it without some difficulty; and
therefore it is no wonder if the <HI>Australi∣ans</HI>
be forced sometimes to maintain great
Wars to defend a Country against the In∣vasions
of those <HI>Foreign Nations,</HI> that be∣ing
sensible of the advantages wherewith
it is blessed, make all possible efforts to
open themselves a way into it. The most
formidable of all those <HI>Neighbouring Na∣tions</HI>
are the <HI>Fondins,</HI> a fierce and warlike
People, who are always ready to make
an Irruption upon them, in those parts
where they are least expected. Which
obliges the <HI>Australians</HI> to keep several
Thousand Men continually in Arms, to
guard the Shoars, and the Avenues of the
Mountains next the <HI>Sea,</HI> where they have
constantly upon Guard 20000 Men in
<PB N="140" REF="73"/>
the Compass of about sixty Leagues of
Country.</P>
<P>The first of those Guards that discovers
an Enemy approaching▪ immediately
gives the signal agreed upon; which signal
consists in throwing up a kind of flying
Squib or Serpent, that flies very high, and
makes a noise to be heard two Leagues;
upon which, all the rest to the right and
left hand, give the same Signals, so that
in 24▪ Hours, all the Coast takes the A∣larm,
and the half of the Guards run to
the place where the Alarm began, with
such celerity, that in less than six Hours
time, there will assemble between 30. and
40000 Men; and when they find them∣selves
strong enough to repulse the Ene∣my,
they take away the first Signal, upon
which, all the rest cease, and no more
Succours march up to them.</P>
<P>But that which seems to me most ad∣mirable
in them, is to see them without
any Commanders to lead them, and with∣out
having any previous Discourse or
Communication one with another, or
receiving any Direction or Instruction;
they know how to post themselves with
so much Order and Discipline, that one
would think they were all so many admi∣rable
experienced Captains, that were
<PB N="141" REF="73"/>
all inspired with the same design, and a∣greed
upon the means how to execute it.</P>
<P>I assisted against two Irruptions, made
by the <HI>Fondins</HI> into the Country. The
first was made about 17 Years after my
Arrival in the Country, and the other
was made the last year of my stay there.
The <HI>Fondins</HI> assembled an Army of about
100000 Men, and attempted to break
through a Passage that was not so watch∣fully
guarded as the rest, 30000 of them
were already passing by favour of the
Night; and had it not been for the indis∣cretion
of some hot-headed Fools among
them that made a great noise, they had all
entred into the Country, before the <HI>Au∣stralians</HI>
could have perceived them; but
that noise having betrayed them, the <HI>Au∣stralians</HI>
seeing the extream danger,
which they were in, doubled their signals,
in which case all the <HI>Sezains</HI> are bound to
take Arms, and march with all Expediti∣on
on to their Assistance; yet the <HI>Fondins,</HI>
who poared in in throngs, met with but
300 <HI>Australians,</HI> that firmly opposed them;
but they did it so vigorously, that they put
a sto<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a considerable while to a Party
of the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Enemies; but at last, being sur∣rounded
on every side by the rest of them
that were gotten further into the Country,
<PB N="142" REF="74"/>
they were all cut in pieces: But howe∣ver,
by selling their Lives so dear, and
keeping the Enemy in play for above Two
Hours, they gave the two <HI>Sezains</HI> time to
come up with them; so that while the
rest were just defeated, another fresh Bo∣dy
of about 1500 Men was drawn toge∣ther
to dispute their passage any further;
the <HI>Fondins</HI> having passed over the Bellies
of the first Party, threw themselves into
the Country, to the number of above
60000, crying out, <HI>Ham, Ham,</HI> which in
their Tongue, is <HI>Victory, Victory.</HI> Notwith∣standing
which, the 1500 <HI>Australians</HI> kept
themselves in a Body as firm as a Rock,
forming a front on all sides of them; but
the <HI>Fondins</HI> surrounding them at last, made
a most horrible slaughter of them.</P>
<P>In the mean while the day began to
break, and a Party of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> being
obstinately set upon, defeating the said
1500 <HI>Australians,</HI> kindled Fires round a∣bout
them, either to burn them, or hin∣der
them at least from escaping: But the
rest of the <HI>Australians</HI> which cam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> run∣ning
thither from all parts, formed at last
a Body of 25000 Men, among whom I
was; and dividing themselves into three
parts, and least of them, which consisted
of between 5 and 6000 Men, endeavoured
<PB N="143" REF="74"/>
to seize the passage, by which the <HI>Fondins</HI>
made their Irruption; the <HI>Fondins</HI> appre∣hensive
of such a Design, had left 20000
Men to guard it, who charged the <HI>Au∣stralians</HI>
with so much fury for five Hours
together, that they would have totally
defeated them, if it had not been for a
Re-inforcement of 3000 Men, who came
in, and maintained the Fight five Hours
longer, with a horrible Slaughter on both
sides: During which time, the two other
Bodies fought with the same Vigour a∣gainst
the rest of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> and the But∣chery
was so great in that place, that the
Field of Battle was become like a Mash of
Mortar, composed of Earth and Blood, in
which the Combatants sunk up to the Knees;
and the <HI>Fondins,</HI> however, began already to
grow weary, when a new Reinforcement
of 20000 <HI>Australians</HI> arrived; who having
forced their way without much opposition
through the <HI>Fondins,</HI> joyned our Troops:
And now, finding our selves much stronger
than our Enemies, we detached away
10000 Men to the assistance of our Bre∣thren
at the passage, a great many of
which were already knockt on the Head
by the <HI>Fondins,</HI> with great Stones, which
they threw down at them from the tops of
the Mountains, where they lay im Ambu∣scade.
<PB N="144" REF="75"/>
On our side, we having fresh
Troops, renewed a fierce Fight against
Men that were already almost spent,
which quickly forced them to give way,
and betake themselves to flight; but when
they saw the passage shut up against them,
and that they were inevitably lost, they
turned back upon us that were pursuing
their Rear, and fighting like desperate
Men, opened themselves a passage thro'
our Troops, which were weary of killing
them.</P>
<P>And having thus forced their way thro'
us, they began to fly in disorder cross the
Country, dispersing themselves on this
side, and that side, in the wide Fields.
The Fight lasted till the middle of the
next Night; and as the <HI>Australians</HI> that
still were marching with fresh Reinforce∣ments
from all parts, met every where in
their passage some flying <HI>Fondins,</HI> still de∣fending
themselves with a great deal of
Bravery; but as soon as they perceived
the approach of this new Reinforcement▪
they turned their backs, and fled. When
the Fight was over, the <HI>Australians</HI> that
had fought, refresht and rested themselves,
and the rest took care to perform the last
Duties to the Brethren, who were killed
in the Battle: They found above 19000
<PB N="145" REF="75"/>
<HI>Australians</HI> killed upon the place, and a∣bout
12000 were wounded, in the num∣ber
of which, I may reckon my self, since
I had an Arm broke, and one of my
Thighs run through: Each one knew
the Dead that belonged to him, and had
them carried back to their respective
Quarters. The necessary orders were like∣wise
given to convey all the Bodies of the
<HI>Fondins,</HI> to the place where they had
made their Irruption; and they found
of them above 90000, which they piled
up one upon another.</P>
<P>Thus passed the first Battle of the <HI>Au∣stralians</HI>
against the <HI>Fondins,</HI> at which I
was present, and which I accordingly
describe, as an Eye-witness: I could not
perceive they observed any other Rule
on our side in their fighting, except it
were to resolve to let themselves be killed,
than to suffer their Ranks to be broken:
As for their defensive Armour, they wear
a sort of light Back and Breast Plate, as
thin as Paper, but yet so hard, that no
blows that are not struck at them with an
extraordinary vigour, are able to pierce
them. As for their Provisions for the
Mouth, on such occasions, they are sup∣plied
every one in particular, from the
respective Quarter, or district, to which
<PB N="146" REF="76"/>
he belonged, the Brethren carrying them
to their <HI>Hab</HI> in the Morning, and the Bre∣thren
of the next <HI>Hab</HI> carrying them to
theirs, and then those of the next to theirs,
and so on, till they be conveyed to the
place where the Men are, for whose use
the Fruit is designed.</P>
<P>The second <HI>Australian</HI> Battle, in which
I was, happened 17 years after that, upon
the following occasion. The <HI>Fondins</HI> had
seized upon a very considerable Island, a∣bout
10 Leagues from the <HI>Sezain,</HI> or Di∣strict
of Grief; it was about 18 Leagues in
length, and 14 in breadth, the Ground
there being very good, they had fortified
themselves there, and were grown very po∣pulous.
The mildness of the Air joyned
with the plenty and fruitfulness of the
place, drawing thither daily a confluence
of new Colonies, from whence they made
hold afterwards to make incursions into
the Continent of the <HI>Australians;</HI> upon
which, those People having taken a Reso∣lution
to drive them out of that Island, they
wrote only to the 500 next <HI>Sezains,</HI> who
detached for that purpose each of them
400 Men, so that in a trice they raised an
Army of 200000 Men; they immediate-prepared
a kind of great flat Ferry-boat,
and built like a Platform, which contained
<PB N="147" REF="76"/>
300 Men in Front, and 400 on each side,
so that it was capable of wafting over
12000 Men, ready ranged, in order of
Battel, which they made to be advanced
in that manner towards the Island. Be∣sides
which, they equipped 600 other
small Vessels, that carried each 100 Men,
and 400 others, laden with Ammunition
and Provisions. Amongst all the Engines
of War, I saw there, I took notice of one,
which consisted of several Ladders, which
stuck certain pointed Irons into the Walls
of any Town they were applied against,
which by the help of a Spring, enlarged
themselves like a hook, as soon as they
had made their passage into the Wall, and
then afterwards being turned about with
a Wheel, these Engines would shake down,
and overthrow the strongest Walls. I was
upon the Ferry-boat, or Platform, when
they began to advance against the <HI>Fondins,</HI>
which had been preparing themselves for
three Months before, for a vigorous De∣fence:
They were provided with all
sorts of Provisions, and their Army was
composed of 300000 fighting Men, all re∣solved
to overcome, or die. In the mean
time, the <HI>Australiaas</HI> being come within
view of the Island of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> made a
stop to consult which way they might be<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
<PB N="148" REF="77"/>
assault their Enemies: And it was conclu∣ded
in Council, that they should Land
20000 Men in the Night out of their
smaller Vessels, to surround the Island,
and to engage the <HI>Fondins</HI> to fight, whilst
10000 more should throw themselves into
the Water, and swim over into the Island
with the Instruments, necessary to beat
down their Walls: which Resolution was
executed with so much Order and Celeri∣ty,
that the <HI>Fondins</HI> had no time to be∣think
themselves how to prevent the blow.
The 10000 attackt the first Wall; and ha∣ving
beaten it down, 2000 of them swam
over, and attacked the second Wall; in
which, when they had made some Breach∣es,
the Sentinels hearing the noise, went,
and immediately alarmed the next Court
of Guard: But the Ardour of the <HI>Austra∣lian</HI>
was so great, that before their Enemies
could have notice of their Approach, they
had already passed to the number of 500
beyond the Wall, who kept firm in a Bo∣dy
to cover the ascent of the others, who
mounted with such a surprizing Expediti∣on,
that in an hours time, 20000 of them
passed over the Wall in spite of all the op∣position
of the <HI>Fondins.</HI> In the mean
while, their King being informed that the
<HI>Australians</HI> were in earnest entring his I∣sland,
<PB N="149" REF="77"/>
took with him 6000 chosen Men out
of a Body of Reserve, and advanced at
the head of them, to view the Enemy.
The <HI>Australians</HI> on their side gave mighty
Shouts to give notice to the rest of their
party behind, that they had passed the
Wall, so that when the <HI>Fondins</HI> had be∣gun
an obstinate fight, the <HI>Australians</HI> that
were not yet passed the Wall, climbed
upon all sides, and in spite of all the Re∣sistance
the <HI>Fondins</HI> could make, scaled,
and passed it, to the number of 50000,
who made themselves Masters of a part of
the Wall, as the day began to appear, up∣on
which the Vessels advanced to the
Shoar, and Landed 20000 more, who like∣wise
passed after their Companions over
the Walls; so that the <HI>Fondins,</HI> who by
that time had got together above 100000
Men, seeing the evident danger that
threatned them, drew themselves all close
up into one united Body, with a Resolu∣tion
to venture all for all, and fell so
fiercely upon a Body of the Enemies
that made head against them, that
they would have entirely defeated
them, if another Body of <HI>Australians</HI> that
had beaten down above 200 Fathoms,
or 400 Yards of Wall, had not come up
timely to their Assistance, which was a
<PB N="150" REF="78"/>
Detachment of 6000 Soldiers from the
Platform; who being all fresh, and in a
good condition, charged the <HI>Fondins</HI> in
the Rear, and made such a dreadful slaugh∣ter
of them, that there hardly escaped
2000, who fled, and saved themselves in
a small adjoyning Fortress, and so the
<HI>Australians</HI> became Masters of the Field:
But however, before they would attack
the Fortresses that stood further within
the Island, they first made sure of all the
Passages and Outworks of it, that they
cut off all possibility from the <HI>Fondins,</HI> of
escaping their Hands: They spent two
days in that work, and two more in look∣ing
for the Bodies of the Brethren that
were slain in the Fight, of which they
reckoned 42000, to whom they paid the
usual Honour of Burial; after which, they
likewise took the number of the <HI>Fondins</HI>
that were killed, which amounted to 12000.</P>
<P>When they had so done, they marched
about to all the Towns in the Island, and
took Five of them by Assault in one day,
most unmercifully killing all they met.
And here I cannot but with Regret, take
notice to you, that I do not believe any
Country in the World can produce more
lovely and beautiful Women than there
were to be seen in this, which made me
<PB N="151" REF="78"/>
in spight of all the Violence I used to my
natural Inclination, in order to conform
my self to the cruel and pittiless Customs
and Proceedings of the <HI>Australians,</HI> not
able to forbear shewing some Marks of
Compassion, when I saw the Throats of
so many fair and charming Creatures, so
miserably, and unmercilesly cut, which
much scandalized those Brethren that ob∣served
my tenderness: but the matter was
much aggravated, when breaking into a
House that seemed more considerable
than the rest, I found in it a venerable
Matron, with two Daughters, of between
25 or 26 Years of Age, of a most Accom∣plish'd
Beauty, that threw themselves down
at my Feet; for their Charms so strongly
Transported me, that being almost bereft
of my Reason, and my Judgment, I incon∣siderately
advanced towards one of those
young Ladies, whom I grasped Affecti∣onately
in my Arms, to lift her up, when
two <HI>Australians</HI> came in, just at that mo∣ment,
and surprized me in the Action.</P>
<P>I saw by the Fire, that flasht in their
Eyes, and by the Indignation which ap∣peared
in their Faces, that I was a lost
Man; nevertheless they contented them∣selves
only with cutting the Throats of
those Ladies in my Presence, I knew not
<PB N="152" REF="79"/>
afterwards, neither what to resolve up∣on,
nor what would become of me, nor
durst I look an <HI>Australian</HI> in the Face;
and as soon as any one came near me, I
held down my Eyes, and Confusion shew∣ed
it self in my Face. In this Perplexity,
I returned on Board to the Vessel, where
I feined my self wounded, that they might
not take it ill, that I had quitted the Ar∣my,
and I remained, with a Spirit so de∣jected
and sad, that I could scarce sup∣port
my self. In the mean time, the plain
Country, and all the Towns being scat∣tered,
they resolved to Attack the strong
places, of which they invested three at
once, and all the works of a Siege among
these People, being to dig the Earth round
about the place which they Attack, 300
Men were employed in that Work for
three days; at the end of which they
came to the Walls, notwithstanding the
Sallies of the <HI>Fondins;</HI> then they under∣mined
them, and dismantled those Cities
in a trice, to the great Astonishment of
all the Inhabitants; they gave at the same
time a general Assault, and all the valour
of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> who defended themselves
very Couragiously, did not hinder them
from taking the strong places in four
days time: The slaughter was there
<PB N="153" REF="79"/>
general, and they spared neither Women,
old People, nor Children, all were en∣veloped
in one common Massacre; those
that were in the other Fortresses, did
not stay to be Besieged, they went out
the Night before they were to be in∣vested,
and the next day, were
to be seen on the Banks of the Sea, more
than 200000 People, of all Ages and
Sexes, some of which threw themselves
head-long into the Water, others cast
themselves upon the Mercy of their E∣nemies,
others with Hands lifted up to
Heaven, expected Death, which they
saw inevitable.</P>
<P>Thus this fine Island was dispeopled,
the <HI>Australians,</HI> collected into many heaps
the Bodies of the <HI>Fondins,</HI> and left them
upon the Banks of the Sea, without bury∣ing,
exposing them to the Birds, who
devoured them. Besides these <HI>Austra∣lians,</HI>
who were killed at the first As∣sault
of the Isle (of which we have
spoken) there was found 18000 more,
which were transported out of the Coun∣try
upon many Vessels: they carried
back the Wounded in the same man∣ner,
which were to the number of
30000 Men.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="80"/>
As the <HI>Australians</HI> are very dilligent at
the <HI>Assemblies</HI> of <HI>Hab,</HI> and of <HI>Heb,</HI> as well
at home, as abroad, so soon as the Isle
was taken, they met together, to praise
God, and to consider of several other Af∣fairs,
of which the principal were how to
dispose of me, and how to destroy the
Island. I was accused upon Five Arti∣cles,
every one of which deserved death;
and having had my hearing, I was sent
back into my <HI>Sezain.</HI> After that, they
came to a resolution to demolish the
Island, with two Armies of fifty Thou∣sand
Men each: and this prodigious
masse of Earth was destroyed, and co∣vered
with Water, in ten of their Months.
A Work which the <HI>Europeans</HI> could never
have finished in ten Years, and which is
more, would never have dared to under∣taken.
This is what I have seen of the
War between the <HI>Australians</HI> and the
<HI>Fondins.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these Enemies, the <HI>Australians</HI>
have those to fight withal, which they
call <HI>Sea-Monsters;</HI> this is the Name they
give the <HI>Europeans,</HI> because they are ig∣norant
of their Country, and they never
see them come but by Sea in Ships. They
<PB N="155" REF="80"/>
never call them any thing else but <HI>Sea-Monsters,</HI>
or <HI>Half-men.</HI> The old Philo∣sopher,
who was so much my Friend,
and who took such delight, a little be∣fore
he died, to hear me talk of my
Country, told me, That he had seen
some People approach their Coasts, who
were made just after the proportion that
I spoke of; that he admired the Fabrick
of their Ships, and that he was always
desirous to know more of the Country of
these <HI>Half-men,</HI> and that he found a
great deal of pleasure in what I had told
him, and what he believed before.</P>
<P>He told me, among other Disputes
which they had had with these <HI>Half-men,</HI>
they had at one time met with so resolute
Men, that they were three whole Days
before they could take Seven of their
Ships: I saw these Vessels upon the
Shoar; for the <HI>Australians</HI> keep all their
Prizes, as Trophies of their Glory and Va∣lour.</P>
<P>When I came thither, about six Months
before, they had defeated a whole Fleet
of them; and I saw a great many Bo∣dies
hung upon the Masts, whom by
their Cloaths, I know to be <HI>French, Spa∣niards,</HI>
and <HI>Portuguese.</HI> My old Man,
who saw the Battle, told me, he never
<PB N="156" REF="81"/>
saw the like of it, except what I did a∣gainst
the wild Birds. The Pilot having
observed some little Rivolets of Water
deep enough, came up within half a Mile
of the Shoar, but not finding there but
two Foot of Water, he was forced to
stop; he immediately caused a Thousand
Men to Land, to view the Country. They
came with a great deal of bravery, and
easily forced the Sea-Guards, who pre∣sently
gave the Signal, the Enemy were
come. But the Enemy having boarded
a <HI>Sezain</HI> which they met, and falling a
plundering, the Sea-Guards did so re∣double
their Signals, that before the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI>
could have done plundering, there
appeared eight Thousand <HI>Australians</HI>
upon the Shoar. The <HI>Europeans</HI> fired a
great many pieces of Cannon, but few
did Execution. In the mean time the
<HI>Australians</HI> surrounded those-few that had
landed, in a little House, which they
had before forced open, and in which
they defended themselves for some time,
but at last they were forced to submit to
Number, and not one Man escaped to
carry the News to the <HI>Fleet.</HI> After that
the <HI>Australians</HI> made a considerable turn
to secure the passage of the River, in
which they are admirable, by filling dex∣trously
<PB N="157" REF="81"/>
the Mouth of the River with such
heaps of Earth, as it was impossible for
the Enemy of pass. After this, they en∣deavoured
to board them, but the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI>
made so good use of their Cannon
and small Arms, that of eight Thousand
<HI>Australians,</HI> there was six Thousand kil∣led
before one Man could board them.
And my old Man assured me, that he ne∣ver
had seen so much bravery in any of
their Enemies. Notwithstanding all this,
the <HI>Australians</HI> being constantly supplied
with fresh Men, they began a new At∣tack
with twelve Thousand Men, who
were very bravely received, but not with
such a loss as the former; they boarded
the Ships with a wonderful courage; yet
the <HI>Europeans</HI> firing from all parts upon
them, they had killed above four Thou∣sand,
when on a suddain the <HI>Australians</HI>
were reinforced with two Thousand
fresh Men, who finding the Enemy al∣ready
quite fatigued, immediately de∣feated
them. There was in all, three
Thousand Seamen, and as many Soldiers,
who had all their Throats cut, in less than
an Hour.</P>
<P>But the ordinary Fights which the <HI>Au∣stralians</HI>
have against the Birds, of which
we have spoken, are much more trou∣blesome;
<PB N="158" REF="82"/>
because coming, and going by
the Air, there is no means neither to
stop, nor destroy them. They fight a∣gainst
these terrible <HI>Beasts</HI> three several
ways; because they are attacked by them
in as many; for sometimes they hide
themselves in the <HI>Trees,</HI> sometimes they
fly out of sight, to throw themselves upon
their Prey in a Minute. The little <HI>Birds,</HI>
of which I have spoke before, will per∣ceive
them a great way off, and strike
their <HI>Bills</HI> with several doleful cries, to
give notice to the <HI>Australians,</HI> to put
themselves upon their Guard. Yet these
<HI>Beasts,</HI> notwithstanding all their precau∣tions,
seldom miss their blow. I remem∣ber
once, as I was going to <HI>Heb,</HI> in the
company of my Philosopher, armed ac∣cording
to our custom, with Halberts,
Casques, and Cuirasses, after our mode,
we had scarce gone half our way, when
the little Birds began to cry, and fly a∣bout
us, in a frightful manner, to give
us notice of our danger. In short, we
immediately perceived some of these
great <HI>Birds,</HI> who came to attack us. We
then crowded one upon the other, cove∣ring
our selves with our Arms, and ma∣king
our selves ready for defence. One
of these dreadful <HI>Beasts</HI> snatched my Hal∣bert
<PB N="159" REF="82"/>
out of my hand, with a force no
man alive was able to resist. The other
five fell so furiously upon my Compani∣ons,
that they had an incredible difficul∣ty
to save themselves; and just as I tur∣ned
my Head, to see how I might come
to their help, I my self was carried off;
and I had been infallibly lost, if five of
my other brethren had not come to my
assistance, and cleared me from the claws
of the <HI>Beast</HI> that held me. But then many
more of our brethren coming in, the
Birds flew away.</P>
<P>But that which is most terrible is, that
these horrible <HI>Beasts</HI> assemble themselves
sometimes to the number of four, or five
hundred, forming a body of an Army;
where it seems they observe a sort of a
Discipline, in their Combats with the
<HI>Australians.</HI> They Camp in all places in∣differently
where they find Food. The
<HI>Australians</HI> canton themselves into their
Houses, none dare stir out; they put up
the Signal to give notice, that the Ene∣my
is there, and every one to take care
of themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="83"/>
The Regularity, which they observe
to fight with these Birds, is greater than
that which they observe to fight the
<HI>Fondins;</HI> they stand close togehter, and
so order it, that they have a Front on
every side. They have their <HI>Sarbecans,</HI>
of which I spoke before; in short, they
are made of Halberts and Cutlaces:
So soon as the Birds perceive them co∣ming
against them, they seperate them∣selves,
some flying on one side, and some
on the other, the greatest part of them
out of sight; but this is only to joyn
themselves the closer, to fall together
upon the <HI>Australians;</HI> who, notwith∣standing
all their Precautions, always
lose some Men in their first Attacks.
I was present at three Fights with them,
we lost at the first 6 Men, at the se∣cond
eight, at the third three; and in
the three Fights altogether we killed but
seven of the Birds. It is impossible to
tell you with what force they fall upon
Men, and what furious strokes they will
give with their Bills; I saw an Action in
the last Combat, that's worth relating,
An <HI>Urg</HI> took away the Halbert of one
of my Companions, and another seized
his Person; I would have defended him
with my Halbert, but a third <HI>Urg</HI> car∣ried
<PB N="161" REF="83"/>
him off: my Neighbour stuck to
him, and the same <HI>Bird</HI> carried away
both: Another took hold of one of
them, but another <HI>Urg</HI> threw himself
furiously at him; and as he was carry∣ing
him of, I joyned my self to him to
stop him, but we had all four been carried
off, if we had not knocked down one
of the <HI>Birds,</HI> for the others immediately
quitted us after that, and we found one
of the <HI>Australians,</HI> which they let fall
dead and strangled, by being pinched
too hard by them; they observe that
when the Sea hath been Tempestuous
for four or five days, these <HI>Birds</HI> are in
a sort of a rage, because they cannot
take the Fish, which they do at other
times for their usual Nourishment. I
have told you before, that the <HI>Australi∣ans</HI>
have, and do yet continue to make
extraordinary Efforts to destroy these
terrible Enemies. They demolished 30
Years ago three considerable Islands,
where these <HI>Birds</HI> harbour, of two Leagues
in length, and at present they are about
destroying another that is six Leagues
from their Country. The most proper
season for this is the Tropick of <HI>Capri∣corn,</HI>
and they continue to the Aequinox
of <HI>March,</HI> at which time <HI>Birds</HI> beginning
<PB N="162" REF="84"/>
to grow warm, begin their threatning,
but without effect, till the Sun enters
into the Sign of <HI>Taurus.</HI> 'Tis then that
they come to Attack the <HI>Australians</HI> in
Troops, with so much fury, that what∣ever
they are able to do, cannot hinder
them from losing several Men; the heat
of these Engagements will sometimes
continue for six Hours together, with∣out
intermission for thirty Days, and
after that, they go away by small Par∣cels,
till the Month of <HI>October,</HI> where they
return again with the same fury.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the return of <HI>Sadeur,</HI> to the
Island of <HI>Madagascar.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Write that which follows of the Isle
of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and I begin to flat∣ter
my self, that this History may go
home with me, even to mine own
Country.</P>
<P>It is easie to judge by all that I have
said of the Incomparability of the hu∣mours
and Interests of the <HI>Australians,</HI>
with the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> that I owed
the Preservation of my Life to nothing
but the desperate Action which I did
when first I came into the <HI>Australian</HI> Coun∣try,
and to the continual violence I did
my self, to conform to their manner of
litving, and to the Care the good old Man
took of me, who was always my Prote∣ctor;
notwithstanding this, as our nature
will shew it self, what-ever Disguises we
put <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there often fell from me some
Words or Actions, which shewed what I
really was. The good old Philosopher
made an hundred Harangues in my De∣fence,
<PB N="164" REF="85"/>
while he was alive, and to stop
the Designs that their Brothers had form∣ed
against me; he set out my fighting as
an unheard of Prodigy, and which alone
rendered me worthy of their Protection,
notwithstanding all my faults. He main∣tained
that since they had taken me
into their Protection, though I was a
Stranger, they could not now take a∣way
my Life without manifest Injustice,
since what I did amiss proceeded from
my Nature; he added after all, that
since I was a Stranger, they ought not
to condemn me till they could hear
what I could say in my own defence.
When he died, he redoubled his En∣treaties,
and Reasons, to oblidge them
to preserve me, and named me to be
his Lieutenant, after an Exhortation,
truly paternal, which he made to me,
and all the Brothers accepted it, with
their common Consent. In fine, he
supported me till the War of the <HI>Fon∣dins,</HI>
of which I have spoke, where my
ruin was fixed, and resolved on.</P>
<P>The Accusation that was formed a∣gainst
me, may be reduced to five
principal heads: The first was, that I
had not fought with the others, since I
<PB N="165" REF="85"/>
could not produce an Ear of the <HI>Fon∣dins:</HI>
Secondly, That I had testified a
great Grief, in seeing the Destruction of
their Enemies: Thirdly, That I had
embraced a <HI>Fundine:</HI> Fourthly, That I
had eaten the Meat of the <HI>Fundines:</HI>
and lastly, That I had made Questions
full of Malice to the Brothers. To
understand these Accusations, you must
know, that it is a Custom of the <HI>Austra∣lians</HI>
to cut off the Ears of those that they
kill in fight, and make a Girdle of them;
he that brings most is esteemed most
Couragious; and there was some that
in the taking of the Island, that brought
off 200.</P>
<P>As for my part, I was so far from ha∣ving
killed any of them, that I testified an
extream regret, to see the bloody <HI>Butchery</HI>
of those unhappy People; I have told you
already of the tenderness which I shewed
to a pretty <HI>Fondin</HI> Lady, whom I found in
an House with her Mother. The <HI>Australi∣ans,</HI>
looked upon this as the greatest crime
I could commit, and there was none of
them afterwards but abhorred me.</P>
<P>They charged me besides, that I had
the boldness ro propose the Preservation
of some of the <HI>Fundines</HI> Women, to be
<PB N="166" REF="86"/>
made use of as Slaves, and that I had
openly declared, that I preferred the Life
of one <HI>Fondin</HI> Woman, before all the
Booty I could pretend to in the Island.</P>
<P>So soon as they had heard these Ac∣cusations
against me, they proposed to
Death to me, but with so imperious an
Air, that I had nothing else to do but to
accept of it: And for as much as they
kept a great silence, when I came to the
Table to eat, according to the Custom▪
I began to speak, and told the Brothers
assembled, that I had such essential Obli∣gations
to them, that I could not leave
them without communicating to them a
grand Secret, which I had for the easie
Destruction of the <HI>Urges</HI> I added, that I
was really guilty of the Crimes of which
I was accused; but since all those crimes
came from my nature, which all Peo∣ple
knew to be like that of the <HI>Fundins;</HI>
I appeal to their Consciences, if being
resolved to suffer me to live among
them, knowing me for a <HI>Fundine;</HI> they
ought not also to pardon those faults,
which were inseparable from those of my
Species: Its true, said I, that I have te∣stified
a great deal of kindness to those Peo∣ple
that were like me; it is true, that I could
<PB N="167" REF="86"/>
cut their Throats; 'tis true, that I shew'd
a compassion for those who are even as
my self: And if I had not done this, I
must have renounced my nature, and
their own Reason, which Judges so well
of things, would have justly condemned
me of cruelty.</P>
<P>If an <HI>Australian</HI> should happen to be a∣mongst
the <HI>Fundines,</HI> would not he be in∣excusable,
if in a War against his own
Nation, he shew'd not some kindness to
them. But after all, do not believe that
I am so desirous to preserve my life, I am
glad to retire, I only demand a delay of
a few days, to have time to shew you,
that this poor Stranger, whom you have
protected, is not ungrateful for the bene∣fits
received of you.</P>
<P>They went out of the <HI>Hab,</HI> according
to the accustomed manner, without gi∣ving
any Answer, so that I saw I had no
other way left, but industriously to study
out some way of returning into my own
Country. In this cogitation, all the Ad∣ventures
of my former Voyage, which
brought me to the place where I now
was, ran in my mind. I had always be∣fore
my Eyes the opportunity which was
so favourable to me; and I imagined, that
<PB N="168" REF="87"/>
if I could, after any fashion, shift away
from the sight of these <HI>Australians,</HI> my re∣turn
would be secured; and after I had
revovled in my mind, a great many se∣veral
methods and designs, this was the
Resolution which I took and executed. I
made a Cord of the bark of a Tree,
which is named <HI>S chuch;</HI> I rubbed it with
the juice of the Fruit <HI>Repose,</HI> mingled with
a little Sea-Water, which render'd it as
hard as Iron; I afterward rubbed it with
another Juice, which made it flexible,
and at last made a kind of Rope, which
I tied fast to a Tree, where the <HI>Urgs</HI> used
to perch; I never ceased to go and come,
expecting with impatience the success
which I had promised my self from this
design. At last my little Birds having ad∣vertised
me to retire, I saw two <HI>Urgs</HI> ve∣ry
high in the Air, which lighted exactly
upon the Tree where I had stretched my
Cord, and one of them was taken by the
end of the Foot.</P>
<P>The Brothers, who saw that he was ta∣ken,
ran presently to knock him down;
but I entreated them to let me alone with
him, assuring them, that they should in
a little while see something more surpri∣sing
than what they now beheld.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="87"/>
My Beast seeing himself taken, con∣tinued
two days in a very ill humour
when I approached him, but at last, when
he saw no appearance of escaping, and
that hunger and famine pressed him, he
begun to be more gentle, and to suffer
me to approach to give him meat; I fed
him all alone, and he began to know
me; I made much of him, and he suffer∣ed
it; I lift up his huge Feet, I looked
upon his Talons, I opened his Beak, and
mounted upon his Back: In fine, I did
whatsoever I would with him: I said
then to my self, since I was first driven
into this Countrey by the persecution of
these Beasts, why may I not depart
hence too by their Assistance? I had
great hope of my Bird, and my hope in∣creased
as his kindness increased to∣wards
me.</P>
<P>In the mean time they spoke of my
Conduct at the <HI>HAB</HI> with praise, and
seeing that they admired it, I made a speech
and told them, that I begun now to look
upon my self as one whose being was in
a manner ceas'd; that since it was the
Custom of our Nation, that when any
one was at the point of Death, to live
with great Reservedness, and that my
spirit would not permit me to be the
<PB N="170" REF="88"/>
same that I had been, and that knowing
that I should cease to be in a little time,
I would employ the Moments that re∣mained
to study out some last action
which should edifie them much more
than my first. These Reasons did very
much satisfie the Assembly, and they
were resolved to let me finish my Life
as I pleased, without speaking any more
either of my words or actions. And since
I ought to be reckoned in the number
of the dead, they themselves named me
Lieutenant, and regarded me no more
but as a dying person, who was at Liber∣ty
to finish his Life as himself thought fit.
This Order gave me so much consolation,
that I then looked upon my deliverance
for most assured.</P>
<P>I passed almost the whole day with my
Bird, and I omitted no way to shew him
all the kindness I possibly could. I per∣ceived
one day that he had a great pain,
and I found that the Cord which set∣ter'd
him had cut the skin of his Foot,
and was entred a good way into his flesh;
the wound was very considerable, and I
used all means possible to cure him; I
poured in the Juice of a Fruit to consoli∣date
the wound, I bound it up handsomly,
and in eight days he became perfectly
<PB N="171" REF="88"/>
well. His kindness upon this augmented
so much towards me, that he would not
suffer me to go from him: And I on the
other side was never content but when
I was with him: I let him by little and
little go loose alone, and he was so far
from flying away, that he made conti∣nual
Efforts to follow me every where:
I was desirous to try whether he could
carry me flying, and I found that he did
it with pleasure, and a surprizing swift∣ness.
After this I made a Girdle of many
Leaves, which I rubbed with the Juice
of the Fruit of Repose, to make it of
proof against Water; I made afterward
a kind of Bag, and having filled it with
the most nourishing Fruits of the Coun∣trey,
and some Bottles of the Liquor
which they drink there, with which I
put also the <HI>Manuscript of this History,</HI> I
put them all up very neatly, and girded
them round about me.</P>
<P>Besides this, I made a little Wallet
which I filled with Fruit for the nourish∣ment
of my Beast, and have tied it neat∣ly
upon his back, I resolved to depart
the night following, which was the
15th of the <HI>Solstice</HI> of <HI>Capricorn</HI> 35 years
and some months after my first arrival
into the <HI>Australian</HI> Countrey, and in the
<PB N="172" REF="89"/>
Fifty seventh year of mine Age.</P>
<P>That my Bird then might the more
easily take his flight, I made him get up
upon a Tree, and seating my self under
his wings, I made him begin his flight
very high in the Air, for fear of being
perceived by those that guarded the Sea,
but the great Cold of the middle Re∣gion
of the Air quickly obliged me to de∣scend
a little lower.</P>
<P>In the mean time we had been above
six mile already on our way, whether
my Beast became again sensible of his
wound, or whether too long a rest had
rendred him more heavy, I perceived he
was extreamly fatigued, and could hold
out no longer: I then so ordered him
to light down upon the Water, and as he
sunk a little too deep, I leaped off to
ease him, well knowing that my Girdle
would support me, and keep me out of
danger. This poor Animal fearing then
that I would be lost, or would quit him,
began to cry and turn towards me with
an agitation that shewed his pain and un∣easiness;
but being my self more weary
than he, I leaned my head upon his
Feathers, and having given him some of
the Fruits in the Wallet, I fell into a
sound sleep. I found the day very fine
<PB N="173" REF="89"/>
and clear at my awaking, and made my
Bird eat again, and took a Repast my
self; I mounted again upon him nimbly
enough, with design to advance the more
swiftly on our way: But whatsoever
Efforts he made, he was never able to
take his flight, because the strange hea∣viness
of my body made him sink too
low in the Water; we were forced then,
whether we would or no, to remain in
the place where we now were, and any
one may judge what pain and trouble I
was then in: Nevertheless, having con∣sidered
that my Beast went very well,
and swiftly in the Water, I tied my
self to his Tail, and he drew me far
enough to discover a little Island which
appeared almost out of sight. As the
night approached, and my Bird being ve∣ry
weary, I staid to feed him, and eat
my self also with him; but I was very
much astonished to see him stop short;
for whether it was that he regretted his
former condition, or whether he could
not live in a different Air from that of
his own Climate, or whether he was
only concerned at the trouble he saw me
in, he would not stir a bit further. Night
came upon us a little after, and he slept
soundly, but I could not so much as shut
<PB N="174" REF="90"/>
mine Eyes: I deliberated a long time
upon what I should do, and after a great
many thoughts, I judged it most conve∣nient
to slip the Wallet from off his
back, and to separate my self entirely
from him, though with a great deal of
regret.</P>
<P>After I had done this, seeing my
Girdle and my Bag supported me per∣fectly
well, I began to go away from my
Beast, and to go forward by the favour
of a South-wind which assisted me; inso∣much
that at Day-break I found my self
arrived without any inconvenience in
the Island which I discovered the night
before.</P>
<P>Then I went out of the Water, and
sat me down upon the Land, and I eat
some of my fruit, with such a sensible
pleasure tempered with that consolation
that I never yet enjoy'd the like. Sleep
seized me afterwards, and I slept about
six hours, and waking I resolved to con∣tinue
my Voyage, and to advance, al∣ways
bearing towards the North, for
fear of being in danger to be lost in the
Great Sea which separates the <HI>Old World
from the New.</HI> But I was scarce got in∣to
the Water when I heard the noise of
the flying of the Great Birds which I have
<PB N="175" REF="90"/>
spoken of. My very Heart trembled at
this noise, and I thought my self lost at
first, but my fear was presently turned
into joy, when I found that it was my
own Beast that was looking for me,
and who came to cast himself at my Feet
with so many caresses and so many marks
of sorrow because I had left him: I was
touched with the most tender compassion
that ever I had in my life, and because
I knew he had tired himself very much
in seeking me, I staid in the Island a Day
and a Night, to rest, and gave him some
fruits out of my Wallet; he had scarce
begun to Eat when ten great Beasts, al∣most
of the colour of our Wolves came
up towards us▪ My Bird who perceived
them before me, set upon them with
great impetuosity and fury, and taking
up one and carrying it up into the Air, he
let it fall upon another and knockt it on
the Head, upon which all the rest imme∣diately
fled, but before they could get to
their Holes, he catched a third, of which
he eat half and brought the rest to me.
The night following I slept with him six
or seven hours, but my Bird did not sleep
till after me, and awaked very near as
soon as I; He no sooner had his Eyes
open, but he fell upon one of the Beasts
<PB N="176" REF="91"/>
that he had slain and made his breakfast
of it: I eat also some of my fruits, and
presently got upon a little Rock and
mounted his Back as before, we advanced
with a surprizing swiftness, and had made
a great deal of way, when two Birds of
the same bigness came to encounter us,
and launching themselves against us, be∣gan
to attack us with great blows, of
their Beaks and Talons. It was impossi∣ble
for this poor Creature to make his
part good, as well because his burden
put him out of a state of defence as that
the two Birds were each of them as
strong as himself; I had received already
some blows which made me all bloody,
and also seeing that we were both of us in
equal danger, and that in hindering him
to save his life, I could not secure mine
own, I leaped off from his back, and cast
my self into the Water, where I lay
some time to look upon the Combat; My
Bird held himself upon the defensive, and
contented himself to present his Talons
and his Beak to guard off the blows as
much as he could. But at last a mist
which begun to spread it self insensibly
quite deprived me of the sight of this
spectacle. I fell then into a deep grief,
and made many reflections upon my un∣happy
<PB N="177" REF="91"/>
Estate, and I was reduced to it by
mine own fault.</P>
<P><HI>Australia</HI> represented it self to me
with all its advantages, and the Island
which I had newly left, seemed to me
extremely Commodious, and I thought
I might have past the rest of my Days
there without fear or danger, because
my Bird would have guarded me against
all that durst attacque me. I then re∣membred
that I was the cause of mine
own unhappiness.</P>
<P>That which compleated my misfortune
was, that I knew not what to do, not be∣ing
able to see thirty yards before me.
These sad thoughts perplexed my mind,
when I heard a great noise like a Ship that
spread all its Sails, I begun to cry out,
when I was perceived by the Marriners
who shot at me, and I was wounded in
many places, but slightly.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Vessel approach∣ing,
they knew by my voice and my
actions, that I was a man▪ they took me
on board, and used me with great com∣passion,
they looked upon my wounds,
and washed them with Oil and Wine
and having poured upon them a precious
Balm they bound them up very neatly.</P>
<P>Because they appeared to be Europe∣ans
<PB N="178" REF="92"/>
I spoke Latine to them, I understood
that they were French, and that their
Vessel parted a little while ago from the
Isle of <HI>Madagascar</HI> with design to cruise
for a booty.</P>
<P>The Captain who was a man of quali∣ty
having understood that I was an Eu∣ropean
came to see me, and spoke to me
with a great deal of kindness, gave me
a suit of his apparel, took me into his
Company, and made me eat at his Table.
The first entertainment I had with him
lasted for three hours. I recounted to him
the History of my Birth, of my Education,
of my Shipwracks, and of my Arrival in
<HI>Australia.</HI> He heard me with a great deal
of attention, &amp; was astonish'd that I could
survive so many evils that I had suffered.
I heard that he spoke in French to the
Company all that I had said in Latin, and
all of them admired that I should escape
so many dangers. He had afterwards
the discretion to let me eat without ask∣ing
me any more questions; But since
I had lost the use of the European meats,
I found no taste in them, and my stomach
would scarce endure them. I took then
of my Fruits which begun to wax old, and
my little Bottles which began to dry, I
offered one to the Captain who tasted it,
<PB N="179" REF="92"/>
and protested that he had never drank any
thing so delicious. He desired a second
of me, and drank to the Mr. Pilot, he
would have a third, and afterwards a
fourth, and never ceased, till my Girdle
was quite empty. There was no body
but admired both the colour and delica∣cy
of the Fruits, and they could scarce
believe they were natural.</P>
<P>Our Repast being over, I was obliged
to begin my History again, and recount
as well as I could possibly, the particu∣lars
of the <HI>Australian</HI> Countrey, the Man∣ners
and Customs of the Inhabitants,
and the rest. The Captain was at a
great loss to believe me, but I reported
so many circumstances of the things
which I advanced, that he could no lon∣ger
doubt of it. He oftentimes protest∣ed
that he would willingly run the dan∣ger
of his Life to see those things which
I had seen. And upon what I said to
him concerning the Situation and
Bounds of the Countrey, he declared
that he saw plainly that his Friends
who were gone thither would infal∣libly
perish.</P>
<P>In the mean time having resolved to
return to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> we set Sail, and
after eight days sailing, we arrived at
<PB N="180" REF="93"/>
the Port of <HI>Tombolo,</HI> which is some∣thing
Southerly to the Isle of <HI>Madagas∣car,</HI>
that is to say, South-west. The
Captain had a great kindness for me,
and would have let me leave him, to
gratifie the Governour of <HI>Tombolo,</HI> who
had a mind to see me.</P>

<P><HI>TOmbolo</HI> is a Port that hath a little
City indifferently strong, in which
there is about five or six thousand Inha∣bitants,
of which the greater part are
<HI>French,</HI> some <HI>Portugals,</HI> others <HI>English,</HI>
and a very few <HI>Hollanders;</HI> the rest are
the Natives of the Countrey, who are
very hard to be civiliz'd. It is under the
Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> in the 65th Me∣ridian,
according to <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> This Coun∣trey
is not only barren, but unhealthful,
so far as I am able to judge. They have
no provision but what is brought from
other places, and the natural Inhabitants
of the Countrey are not yet subjected,
<PB N="181" REF="93"/>
nor have any fixed abode. Here again
I recounted my History at length to the
Governour, and had many Conferences
with him, yet being tired with staying
so long for a Ship to return into <HI>Europe,</HI>
I prayed the Governour to give me some
Men to conduct me up the River which
they call <HI>Sildem,</HI> to enter higher into
the Countrey to make some discoveries.
The Governour assured me that he had
had the same curiosity formerly himself,
but that he was diverted from it by the
certain information he had that the In∣habitants
of the Countrey were such
Salvages, that they spared no person;
and he added, that about three months
before they entrapped two Souldiers,
and that he had heard by a Salvage, that
they had tied them by the Feet, and
hanged them in Trees at five or six
paces distance, then knocked them one
against the other, that by hurting and
beating one against another, they might
be bruised to death; and that round
about them there was a great number of
Children who expected when the blood
and brains of those miserable people
should fall to the ground, on purpose to
gather them up, and eat them. And that
these barbarous people having seen them
<PB N="182" REF="94"/>
render up their last gasp in these cruel
Torments, had taken down their bruised
Bodies beaten all black, and devoured
them without any other dressing.</P>
<P>These cruelties hindred me from de∣siring
to know more particularly either
the Countrey or the Inhabitants. I
began then to be extreamly troubled,
when there arrived at the Port a French
Vessel, which brought a kind of a
Chaloop along with him, which they
had seized upon in a Ferry-place as it
was passing into an Island of the Sou∣thern
Countrey. There was no body
on Board but a <HI>Venerable old man</HI> ac∣compained
with the six Rowers which
served him in the room of Valetts.
This man looked very much like an
<HI>Australian;</HI> his Forehead and Chin
were squarer than they were long, his
Hair and all his Beard black, and
his Body of a brown Colour. As soon
as I saw him I was touched with com∣passion
for him, and had an extream de∣sire
to know who he was. The Go∣vernour
made no difficulty to give me
leave to see him, being desirous that I
should draw out by his means some
knowledge of the Countrey, which yet
he hardly believed could be done. I
<PB N="183" REF="94"/>
came then to the old man, and having
testified to him by many signs that I was
in the same Captivity with himself, he
began to shew some signs of comfort.
After three or four Enterviews, I found
a way to make my mind known to him
after this manner. We agreed by signs
to frame certain words to explain our
thoughts. I formed two hundred in
one night which he comprehended easi∣ly;
Having formed in two months time
a kind of Language sufficiently capable
to make us understand one another.
I told him all my History, my Ship∣wracks,
my Arrival in <HI>Australia,</HI> the
stay I had made there, and the manner
of my escape. Having engaged him
by all this freedom and openness to
put confidence in me; he made no
difficulty to discover several consider∣able
circumstances of his Countrey to
me. He told me that he lived in the
middle of an Island, that the Climate
was very Healthful, the Land very
Fertile, and the People well Accom∣plished.
That they had two strong Bar∣ricadoes
that separated them on the East
and West from two barbarous People;
to wit, two prodigious Mountains;
that of the East was called <HI>Harnor,</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="95"/>
that of the West <HI>Canor:</HI> And that
on the Sea-side, Nature had walled
them in with such banks of Sand, that
they could not get over them without
the experience of many years, he added
that their Countrey was about six thousand
Miles about, that the Government was
Aristocratical, and that they chose eve∣ry
three years six Governours; the first
for the North-Sea, the second for the
South-Sea, the third for Mount <HI>Harnor,</HI>
the fourth for Mount <HI>Canor,</HI> and two
others for the rest of the Countrey;
that these Governours had power of
Life and Death over all People within
their district of what condition soever
they were. For the rest, that they
cultivated the Earth, and sowed and
reaped as they did in <HI>Europe;</HI> that the
beasts which served them for Labour
were of the bigness of Elephants. That
in General the People of this Countrey
loved their Liberties more than their
Lives, that he was one of the Gover∣nours
of which he had told me, whose
unhappy loss was caused by a Tempest
that rose against all appearance as he
was going to visit some banks of Sand
which encreased extraordinarily, that
the Tempest having carried him a great
<PB N="185" REF="95"/>
way off he fell into the hands of Pirates,
who delivered him to the Governour
of <HI>Tombolo.</HI></P>
<P>We passed whole days in this agree∣able
conversation, when there arrived
two Ships from the <HI>Mogul</HI> that were to
depart in a few days for <HI>Leghorn.</HI> I was
a little troubled to be deprived of the
conversation of a man so agreeable and
reasonable, nevertheless not being wil∣ling
to lose so fair an occasion, I told
him that I was resolved to take this
opportunity to return into my own
Countrey.</P>
<P>This news did sensibly afflict him, yet
he declared that my design was too rea∣sonable
to be opposed, and some days
after going to take my leave of him,
he answered me coldly, that he should
leave me first, and prayed me that I
would preserve that Friendship for him
in my heart, of which I had given
him so many testimonies of since our ac∣quaintance.</P>
<P>A little while after, he cast himself at
my feet, to signifie the esteem which he
had for me, and having cryed out five or
six times in his Language, two of his
Valletts ran to him and strangled him;
and afterwards ran with their heads so
<PB N="186" REF="96"/>
forcibly one against the other, that they
beat out their brains and both fell dead
upon the place.</P>
<P>The four others, though they were
at a distance, did the same in a moment,
so that they were all found dead toge∣ther,
which extreamly surprized the
Governour and all that were with him.</P>
<P>These are the contents of <HI>Sadeurs
Memoirs</HI> written with his own hand.
<HI>His History ends here,</HI> and in all appear∣ance
being Embarqued presently after
the Death of the old man of which we
have spoken, he had no leisure to write
the <HI>Adventures</HI> of his return in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
