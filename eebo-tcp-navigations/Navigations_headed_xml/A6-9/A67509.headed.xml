<HEAD>A CHARACTER OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IF all our <HI>European</HI> Travellers direct their Course to <HI>Italy,</HI> upon the account of its Antiquity, why should <HI>Scotland</HI> be neglected, whose wrinkled surface derives its Original from the <HI>Chaos?</HI> The first Inhabitants were some Straglers of the faln Angels, who rested themselves on the Con∣fines, till their Captain <HI>Lucifer</HI> provided places for them in his own Countrey. This is the Conjecture of Learned Criticks, who trace things to their Originals; and this Opinion was grounded on the Devil's Brats, yet re∣sident amongst them, (whose fore-sight in the events of good and evil, exceeds the Oracles at <HI>Delphos)</HI> the supposed Issue of those Pristine Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Names of Countries were not then in fashion, those came not in till <HI>Adam</HI>'s days, and History (being then in her Infancy) makes no mention of the changes of that Renowned Countrey, in that Interval betwixt him and <HI>Moses,</HI> when their Chronicle commences, she was then Baptised (and most think with the Sign of the Cross) by the Venerable Name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>Scota,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Hence came the Rise and Name of these present Inha∣bitants, as their Chronicle insorms us, and is not to be doubted of, from divers considerable Circumstances; the Plagues of <HI>Egypt</HI> being entailed upon them, that of <HI>Lice</HI> (being a Judgment unrepealed) is an ample Testimony, these loving Animals accompanied them from <HI>Egypt,</HI> and remain with them to this day, never forsaking them (but as Rats leave a House) till they tumble into their Graves. The Plague of <HI>Biles</HI> and <HI>Blains</HI> is hereditary to them, as a distin∣guishing Mark from the rest of the World, which (like the Devil's cloven Hoof) warns all Men to beware of them. The Judgment of Hail and Snow is na∣turalized and made free Denison here, and continues with them from the Sun's first ingress into <HI>Aries,</HI> till he has passed the <HI>30th.</HI> degree of <HI>Aquary.</HI></P>
<P>The Plagues of Darkness was said to be thick Darkness, to be felt, which most undoubtedly these People have a share in, as the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (Darkness) implies; the Darkness being appliable to their gross and blockish understandings (as I had it from a Scholar of their own Nation.) Upon these Grounds this Original is undeniably allowed them, and the Countrey it self (in <HI>Pyramids)</HI> resembles <HI>Egypt,</HI> but far exceeds them both in bulk and number; theirs are but the Products of Mens Labours, but these are Nature's own handy-work; and if <HI>Atlas</HI> would ease a Shoulder, here he may be fitted with a Supporter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<HI>Italy</HI> is compared to a Leg, <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Louse, whose Legs and engrailed Edges represent the Promontories and Buttings out into the Sea, with more Nooks and Angles than the most conceited of my Lord Mayor's Custards; nor does the Comparison determine here: A Louse preys upon its own Fosterer and Preserver, and is productive of those Minute-Animals called Nitts; so <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose <HI>Proboscis</HI> joyns too close to <HI>England,</HI> has suckt away the Nutriment from <HI>Northumberland,</HI> as the Countrey it self is too true a Testimony, and from its opposite A—, has calved those Nitty Islands, call'd the <HI>Orcades,</HI> and the <HI>Shet∣land,</HI> (quasi <HI>Shite-land)</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>The Arms of the Kingdom was anciently a Red-Lyon Rampant, in a Field of Gold, but <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 787. they had the Augmentation of the double Tressure, for assisting the <HI>French</HI> King; but His Majesty's Arms in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a more <HI>Hysteron Proteron,</HI> the Pride of the People being such, as to place the <HI>Scots</HI> Arms in the <HI>dexter</HI> Quarter of the Escutcheon, and make the Unicorn the <HI>dexter</HI> Sup∣porter, with the Thistle at his Heel, with a suitable Motto, <HI>Nemo me impune lacessit,</HI> true enough; whoever deals with them shall be sure to smart for't: The Thistle was wisely placed there, partly to shew the Fertility of the Countrey, Nature a∣lone producing Plenty of these gay Flowers, and partly as an Emblem of the People, the top whereof having some colour of a Flower, but the bulk and sub∣stance of it, is only sharp and poysonous Pricks.</P>
<P>Woods they have none, that suits not with the Frugality of the People, who are so far from propagating any, that they destroy those they had upon this politick State Maxim, that Corn will not grow on the Land pestered with its Roots, and their Branches harbour Birds, Animals above their humble Conver∣sation, that exceeds not that of hornless <HI>Quadrupedes;</HI> marry, perhaps, some of their Houses lurk under the shelter of a plump of Trees (the Birds not daring so high a presumption) like <HI>Hugh Peter</HI>'s Puss in her Majesty, or an Owl in an Ivy-bush. Some Firr-Woods there are in the High-lands, but so inaccessible, that they serve for no other use than Dens for those ravenous Wolves with two Hands, that prey upon their Neighbourhood, and shelter themselves under this Covert; to whom the sight of a Stranger is as surprizing as that of a Cocka∣trice. The Vallies for the most part are covered with <HI>Beer,</HI> or <HI>Bigg,</HI> and the Hills with Snow; and as in the Northern Countries the Bears and Foxes change their Coats into the Livery of the Soil, so here the Moor-Fowl (called <HI>Terma∣gants)</HI> turn white, to suit the Sample, though the Inhabitants still stand to their <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hue.</P>
<P>They are freed from the charge and incumbrance of Enclosures, the whole being but one large Waste, surrounded with the Sea: Indeed in many places, you may see half a Root of Land divided with an Earthen Bank, into many differing Apartments, according to the quality of Beasts that are to posses<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey will make up a Park, Forest, or Chace, as you'll please to call it; but if you desire an Account of particular Parks, they are innume∣rable, every small House having a few Sodds thrown into a little Bank about it, and this for the State of the business (forsooth) must be called a Park, though not a Pole of Land in't.</P>
<P>If the Air was not pure and well refined by its agitation, it would be so in∣fected with the Stinks of their Towns, and the Streams of their nasty Inhabi∣tants, that it would be pestilential and destructive; indeed, it is too thin for their gross Senses, that must be fed with suitable Viands, their Meat not affecting their distempered Pallats, without it have a damnable hogoe, nor Musick their Ears without loud and harsh Discord, and their Nostrils (like a Jew's) chiefly de∣light in the perceptible effluviums of an old Sir R—.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Fowl are as scarce here as Birds of Paradise, the Charity of the Inhabitants denying harbour to such Celestial Animals, though Gulls and Cormorants abound, there being a greater sympathy betwixt them. There is one sort of ravenous Fowl amongst them that has one web foot, one foot suited for Land, and another for Water; but whether or no this Fowl (being particular to this Countrey) be not the lively Picture of the Inhabitants, I shall leave to wiser Conjectures.</P>
<P>Their Rivers, or rather Arms of the Sea are short, few places in <HI>Scotland</HI> being above a day's Journey from the Sea, but they are broad, deep and dangerous pestered, with multitudes of Porposses or Sharks (some of them perhaps amphi∣bious too, that live more on Land than Water) which destroy their Salmon, the great Commodity of this Countrey, which being too good for the Inhabitants, are barreled up, and converted into Merchandize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Banks and Borders, of these Rivers (especially near their Towns) are adorned with hardy Amazons, though inverted, their Valour being (chiefly) from the waste downwards, which parts they readily expose to all the dangers of a naked rencounter. The exercise of their Arms, I should say Feet, is much about Linnen; Sheets are sufferers, a fit receiver is provided (not unlike a shallow Pulpit to mind them of their Idol Sermons) wherein foul Linnen is laid to suffer Persecution, so they turn up all, and tuck them about their wasts, and bounce into a Buck-tub, then go their Stock, and belabour poor Lint till there be not a dry thread on't. Hence came the Invention of Fulling-Mills, the Women taught the Men, and they put in practice.</P>
<P>The Countrey is full of Lakes and Loughs, and they well stockt with Islands, so that a Map thereof, looks like a Pillory-Coat, bespattered all over with Dirt and rotten Eggs, some pieces of the Shells floating here and there, representing the Islands.</P>
<P>Their Cattle are only representatives of what are in other Countries, these being so Epitomized, that it is hard to know what <HI>Class</HI> they relate to. Their Horses are hardy, and not without Gall (as some say other Horses are) using both Tooth and Nail to mischief you; that they may not use more state than their Masters, they go bare-foot, which preserves them from the Gout; and if <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s Horse had been of this Race, he had not needed a Corn-cutter: Their Furniture or Harness is all of the same matter, all Wood from Head to Tail, Bridle, Saddle, Girths, Stirrups and Crupper, all Wood; nothing but a Withy will bind a Witch, and if these be called Witches, I shall not oppose it, since by their untoward Tricks, one would guess the Devil to be in them; their Bri∣dles have not Bits, but a kind of Musrol of two pieces of Wood; their Crupper is a Stick of a Yard's length, put cross their Docks, both ends thereof being tied with woven Wood to the Saddle. Their Bed and Board too, is all of the same dry Straw, and when they have it up, whip on Harness, and away. Their Neat are hornless, the Owners claiming sole Propriety in those Ornaments, nor should I deny them their Necklace too, for methinks that hoisted Wood would mightily become them. Their Sheep too have the same preferment, they are coupled together near their Master's Palace. Some Animals they have by the name of Hogs, but more like Porcupines, bristled all over, and these are likewise fastned to the Free-hold by the former Artifice; all their <HI>Quadrupedes</HI> (Dogs only excepted, in which sort they much abound) are honoured with Wooden Brace∣lets about their Necks, Legs, or Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Cities are poor and populous, especially <HI>Edenborough,</HI> their Metropolis, which so well suits with the Inhabitants, that one Character will serve them both, <HI>viz.</HI> High and Dirty. The Houses mount seven or eight Stories high, with many Families on one Floor, one Room being sufficient for all Occasions, Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and Shit—The most mannerly step, but to the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Door, and Nest upon the Stairs. I have been in an Island where it was difficult to tread without breaking an Egg; but to move here, and not murder a T—is next to an impossibility; the whole Pavement is Pilgrim-salve, most excellent to liquor Shooes withal, and soft and easie for the bare-foot Perambulators. The Town is like a double Comb (an Engine not commonly known amongst them) one great Street, and each side stockt with narrow Allies, which I mistook for Common shores; but the more one stirs in a T—the more it will stink. The other Cities and Towns are Copies from this Original, and therefore need no Commentators to explain them; they have seven Colleges (or rather Schools) in four Universities; the Regents wear what colour'd Cloaths or Gowns they please, and commonly no Gowns at all, so that 'tis hard to distinguish a Scholar from an ordinary Man, since their Learning shines not out of their Noses; the younger Students wear Scarlet Gowns only in Term time; their Residence is commonly in the Town, only at School hours they convene in the College to consult their Oracle <HI>Buchanan;</HI> their chief Studies are for Pulpit preferment, to prate out four or five Glasses with as much ease as drink them; and this they attain to in their stripling years, commencing Masters of Arts (that is meant only Masters of this Art) before one would judge them fit for the College; for as soon as they can walk as far as the School (which they will do very young, for like Lapwings they run with Shells on their Heads) they are sent thither, where they find no Benches to sit on (only one for the Master) but have a little Heath and Fadder strewed for them to lie upon, where they litter toge∣ther, and chew the Cud on their Fathers Horn books, and in good time are pre∣ferred to the Bible; from this petty School, away with them to the Grammar-School, <HI>viz.</HI> the College, where in three or four years time they attain to (their <HI>ne plus ultra)</HI> the degree of A. M. that is, they can <HI>extempore,</HI> coin Graces and Prayers for all Occasions; if you crack a Nut, there is a Grace for that, drink a Dish of Coffee, Ale or Wine, or what else, he presently furnishes you with a Grace for the nonce; so if you pare your Nails, go to Stool, or any other action of like importance, he can as easily suit you with a Prayer, as draw on a Glove; and the wonder of all is, that, this Prayer shall be so admirably framed, that it may indifferently quadrate with any occasion, an excellency no where so common as in this Countrey. Thus you see the young Man has commenced and got strength enough to walk to the Kirk and enter the Chair, where we shall find him anon, after we have viewed the out-sides of their Kirks, some of which have been of Antient Foundations, and well and regularly built, but Order and Uniformity is in perfect Antipathy to the humour of this Nation, these goodly Structures being either wholly destroyed (as at St. <HI>Andrews</HI> and <HI>Elgin,</HI> whore by the remaining Ruins you may see what it was in perfection) or very much de∣faced; they make use of no Quires, those are either quite pulled down, or con∣verted into another Kirk, for it is common here to have three, four, or five Kirks under one Roof, which being preserved entire, would have made one good Church, but they could not then have had Preaching enough in it: Out of one Pulpit now they have thirty Sermons <HI>per</HI> Week, all under one Roof, plenty of spiritual Provision, which gusts much better with a mixture of the Flesh; as you may guess by their Stools of Repentance in every Kirk, well furnished with Whoremongers and Adulterers of both Sexes. In <HI>Venice,</HI> the shadows only of Curtezans are exposed to publick view only in Effigic, but here the Whore in Person has a high place provided her in the view of the whole Congregation for the benefit of Strangers, who (some think) need not this direction, but may truck for all Commodities, with the first they meet with. They use no Service-Book, not Whore of <HI>Babylon</HI>'s Smock (as they term a Surplice) nor decency, nor order in their divine, or rather contumelious Service. Would a
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
King think himself honoured by Subjects, that petitioned him with Bonnet valed, but cockt his Cap the while his request was granting, while precious Mr. <HI>Presbyter,</HI> grimaces, prays or houls, the Monster Rabble vails; but as soon as Text is taken, Blew-bonnet takes place again, and this Pulpit-prater is esteemed more than God's Ambassador, having the Holy Spirit at his beck to prompt him every word he speaks, yet not three sentences of sence together, such Blasphemy as I blush to mention.</P>
<P>Their Christnings (as all other things) are without Form, only Water poured on the Infant, and such words used as Sir <HI>John's Mephistophilus</HI> supplies him with, and so the Child commences Christian, as good (or better) than the best of them. Some think Marriage an unnecessary thing amongst them, it being more generous and usual amongst them to take one another's words; however, 'tis thus performed, the young Couple being attended with Tag-rag and Bob-tail, gang to Kirk, where Mr. <HI>Scruple</HI> (like a good Casuist) controverts the point in hand to them, and schools Mr. Bridegroom in his Lesson, then directs his Dis∣course to Mrs. Bride, who being the weaker Vessel, ought to have the more pains taken with her; he chalks out the way she is to walk in, in all its par∣ticulars, and joyns their hands, and then let them fall to on God's Name: Home they go with loud ravishing Bag-pipes, and dance about the Green, till they part by Couples to repetition, and so put the Rules in practice, and per∣haps Sir <HI>Roger</HI> follows Mrs. Bride to her Apartment, to satisfie her doubts, where he uses such pungent and pressing Arguments, as she never forgets as long as she lives.</P>
<P>When any one dies, the Bell-man goes about ringing their Passing-Bell, and acquaints the People therewith, in form following, <HI>Beloved Brouthrin, and Susters, I let yau to wot that thir is an fauthful Broothir lawtli departed awt of this prisant varld, and thi plesuir of Aulmoughti Good</HI> (and then he vails his Bonnet) <HI>his Naum is</HI> Volli Voodcock, <HI>thrid Son to</HI> Jimmoy Voodcock, <HI>a Cordinger; he ligs aut thi sext door vethin thi Nord Gawt, close on thi Nawthwr Rawnd, and I wod yaw gang to hus burying on</HI> Thrusdau <HI>before twa a Clock,</HI> &amp;c. The time appointed for his Burying being come, the Bell-man calls the Com∣pany together, and he is carried to the Burying-place, and thrown into the Grave (as Dog-Lyon was) and there's an end of <HI>Wolli.</HI> Few People are here buried in their Kirks (except of their Nobility) but in the <HI>Kirk Garths,</HI> or in a burying place on purpose, called the <HI>Hoof,</HI> at the further end of the Town (like our Quakers) enclosed within a Wall, so that it serves not only as a Burying place, but an Exchange to meet in; perhaps in one part of it their Courts of Judicature are kept; in another are Butts to shoot at for Recreation. All agree that a Woman's Tongue is the last Member she moves, but the Latin Proverb, <HI>mulieri ne credas,</HI> &amp;c. seems to prove it after death: I am sure the pride of this People never leaves them, but follows them to their long homes (I was about to have said, to the Devil) for the meanest Man must have a Grave stone full fraught with his own Praises (though he was the vilest Mis∣creant upon Earth) and miserable <HI>memento mori's,</HI> both in English and Latin, nay, Greek too, if they can find a Greek word for <HI>Cordinger,</HI> the Calling he was of, and all this in such miserable <HI>Scotch</HI> Orthography, that 'tis hard to distinguish one Language from another.</P>
<P>The Castles of defence in this Countrey are almost impregnable, only to be taken by Treachery or long Siege, their Water failing them soonest; they are built upon high, and almost inaccessible Rocks, only one forc'd passage up to them, so that a few Men may easily defend them. Indeed, all the Gentlemens Houses are strong Castles, they being so Treacherous one to another, that they are forced to defend themselves in strong holds; they are commonly built upon
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
some single Rock in the Sea, or some high Precipice near the mid-land, with many Towers and strong Iron Grates before their Windows (the lower part whereof, is only a wooden Shutter, and the upper part Glass) so that they look more like Prisons than Houses of Reception; some few Houses there are of late erection, that are built in a better form, with good Walks and Gardens about them, but their Fruit rarely comes to any perfection. The Houses of the Commonalty are very mean, Mud-wall and Thatch the best; but the poorer sort live in such miserable Hutts as never Eye beheld, it is no difficulty to piss over them; Men, Women and Children pigg altogether in a poor Mouse hole of Mud, Heath, and such like matter; in some parts where Turf is pentiful, they build up little Cabbins thereof, with arched Roots of Turf, without a stick of Timber in it; when the House is dry enough to burn, it serves them for Fuel, and they remove to another. The Habit of the People is very different, accor∣ding to the Qualities, or the Places they live in, as Low-land or High-land Men. The Low-land Gentry go well enough habited, but the poorer sort go (almost) naked, only an old Cloak, or a part of their Bed-cloaths thrown over them. The Highlanders wear slashed Doublets, commonly without Breeches, only a Plad tied about their Wasts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thrown over one Shoulder, with short Stoc∣kings to the Gartering place, their Knees, and part of their Thighs being naked; others have Breeches and Stockings all of a piece, of Plad-Ware, close to their Thighs; in one side of their Girdle sticks a Durk or Skean, about a Foot or half a Yard long, very sharp, and the back of it filed into divers notches, whereie they put Poyson; on the other side a brace (at least) of brass Pistols; nor is this Honour sufficient, if they can purchase more, they must have a long swinging Sword.</P>
<P>The Women are commonly two handed Tools, strong-posted Timber, they dislike English-Men, because they have no Legs, or (like themselves) Posts to walk on; the meaner go bare-foot and bare-head, with two black Elflocks on either side their Faces; some of them have scarce any Cloaths at all, save part of their Bed cloaths pinn'd about their Shoulders, and their Children have no∣thing else on them but a little Blanket; those Women that can purchase Plads, need not bestow much upon other Cloaths, these Coversluts being sufficient. Those of the best sort that are very well habited in their modish Silks, yet must wear a Plad over all for the Credit of their Countrey.</P>
<P>The People are Proud, Arrogant, Vain-glorious Boasters, Bloody, Barbarous, and Inhumane Butchers. Couzenage and Theft is in perfection amongst them, and they are perfect English haters, they shew their Pride in exalting themselves and depressing their Neighbours. When the Palace at <HI>Edenburgh</HI> is finished, they expect his Majesty will leave his rotten House at <HI>White Hall,</HI> and live splen∣didly amongst his nown Countrey-men the <HI>Scots;</HI> for they say that English∣men are very much beholden to them that we have their King amongst us. The Nobility and Gentry Lord it over their poor Tenants, and use them worse than Gally Slaves; they are all bound to serve them, Men, Women, and Chil∣dren; the first Fruits is always the Landlord's due, he is the Man that must first board all the young married Women within his Lairdship, and their Sons are all his Slaves, so that any mean Laird will have six, or ten, or more fol∣lowers, besides those of his own Name, that are inferiour to him, must all at∣tend him (as he himself must do his Superiour, of the same Name, and all of them attend the Chief) if he receives a Stranger, all this Train must be at his beck, armed as aforesaid; if you drink with them in a Tavern, you must have all this Rubbish with you; and if you offend the Laird, his Durk shall soon be sheathed in your Belly, and after his, every one of his Followers, or they shall suffer themselves that refuse it, that so they may be all alike guilty of
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
the Murder: Every Laird (of note) hath a Gibbet near his House, and has Power to condemn and hang any of his Vassals; so they dare not oppose him in any thing, but must submit to his Commands, let them be never so unjust and tyrannical. There are too many Testimonies of their Cruelty amongst them∣selves in their own Chronicles, Forty of their Kings have been barbaroufly Mur∣dered by them, and half as many more have either made away themselves for fear of their torturing of them, or have died miserably in streight Imprison∣ment. What strange Butcheries have been committed in their Feuds, some of which are in agitation at this day, <HI>viz. Argile</HI> with the <HI>Macclans,</HI> and <HI>Mac Donnels</HI> about <HI>Mula</HI> Islands, which has cost already much Blood, and is likely will cost much more before it be decided; their Spirits are so mean, that they rarely Rob, but take away Life first, lying in Ambuscade, they send a brace of Bullets on Embassy through the Traveller's Body; and to make sure work, they sheath their Durks in his liveless Trunk; perhaps, to take off their fire Edges, as new Knives are stuck in a Bag pudding. If an Highlander be injured, those of his own Name must defend him, and will certainly have satisfaction from the Offenders: A late instance whereof was at <HI>Inverness,</HI> (a considerable Town) where one of the <HI>Macdonnels</HI> was slain, but shortly, the chief of the Name came down against the Town with 1500 Men of his own Name, and threatned to fire the Town, but the Inhabitants compounded with them for 2000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Their Cruelty descends to their Beasts, it being a Custom in some places to feast upon a living Cow they tie in the middle of them, near a great Fire, and then cut Collops of this poor living Beast, and broil them on the Fire, till they have mangled her all to pieces; nay, sometimes they will only cut off as much as will satisfie their present Appetites, and let her go till their greedy Stomachs calls for a new supply; such horrid Cruelty as can scarce be parallel'd in the whole World! Their Theft is so well known, that it needs no proving, they are forc'd to keep Watch over all they have, to secure it; their Cattel are watch'd day and night, or otherwise they would be over-grown by morning. In the High-lands they do it publickly before the face of the Sun, if one Man has two Cows, and another wants, he shall soon supply himself from his Neighbour, who can find no Remedy for it. The Gentry keep an Armory in their own Houses, furnish'd with several sorts of Fire Arms, Pikes and Halberts, with which they Arm their Followers, to secure themselves from the Rapine of their Neighbour∣hood. The Lowland Language may be well enough understood by an English∣man, but the Highlanders have a peculiar <HI>Lingua</HI> to themselves, which they call <HI>Erst,</HI> unknown to most of the Lowland Men, except only in those places that border on them, where they can speak both: Yet these People are so currish, that if a Stranger enquire the way in English, they will certainly answer in <HI>Erst,</HI> and find no other Language than what is forc'd from them with a Cudgel. If <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> had travelled <HI>Scotland,</HI> sure Cookery had not been found in his Vanity of Sciences, such is their singular Skill in this Art, that they may defie the World to rival them; King <HI>James</HI>'s Treat for the Devil, that is, a Poll of Ling, a Joll of Sturgeon, and a Pigg, with a Pipe of Tobacco for dige∣stion, had been very compleat, if the ordering thereof had been assigned to a Cuke of this Countrey, who can sute every Dish with its proper Hogo, and bring Corruption to your Table, only to mind Men of Mortality: Their Meat is Carrion when 'tis kill'd, but after it hath been a Fortnight perfuming with the aromatick Air, strained through the calmy Trunks of Flesh-flies, then it passes the trial of Fire under the Care of one of those exquisite Artists, and is dish'd up in a Sea of sweet <HI>Scotch</HI> Butter, and so covered and served hot up to the Table: O how happy is he that is placed next to it, with a privilege to un∣cover it, and receive the hot steams of this dainty Dish, almost sufficient
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
to cure all Distempers. It will be needless to instance in particulars so plain and evident to all that have travell'd through the Countrey, that they may certainly bear away the Bell from all their Neighbouring Nations, or indeed from the whole World. Their Nobility and Gentry have Tables plentifully enough fur∣nish'd, but few or none of them have their Meat better order'd: To put one's Head into their Kitchen doors, is little less than destructive; to enter Hell alive, where the black Fairies are busied in mangling dead Carcases, and the Fire and Brimstone, or rather stew and stink, is ready to suffocate you, and yet (which is strange) these things are agreeable to the humours of the People. The poorer sort live on Haddock, Whiting, and sour Milk, which is cryed up and down the Streets <HI>(Whea buyes sawer Milk)</HI> and upon the stinking Fragments that are left at their Lairds Table. Prodigious Stomachs, that like the <HI>Gulon,</HI> can feed on their own Excrements, and strain their Meat through their Stomachs, to have the pleasure of devouring it again!</P>
<P>Their Drink is Ale made of Beer-Malt, and Tunned up in a small Vessel, called a Cogue; after it has stood a few hours, they drink it out of the Cogue, Yest and all; the better sort, Brew it in larger quantities, and drink it in wooden Queighs, but it is sorry stuff, yet excellent for preparing Birdlime; but Wine is the great Drink with the Gentry, which they pour in like Fishes, as if it were their natural Element; the Glasses they drink out of, are considerably large, and they always fill them to the brim, and away with it; some of them have arrived at the perfection to tope Brandy at the same rate: sure these are a Bowl above <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and of right, ought to have a nobler Throne than a Hogshead.</P>
<P>Musick they have, but not the Harmony of the Spheres, but loud terrene Noises, like the bellowing of Beasts; the loud Bag pipe is their chief Delight, stringed Instruments are too soft to penetrate the Organs of their Ears that are only pleased with sounds of substance.</P>
<P>The High-ways in <HI>Scotland</HI> are tolerably good, which is the greatest Comfort a Traveller meets with amongst them; they have not Inns, but Change Houses (as they call them) poor small Cottages, where you must be content to take what you find, perhaps Eggs with Chucks in them, and some Lang Cale; at the better sort of them, a Dish of chopp'd Chickens, which they esteem a dainty Dish, and will take it unkindly if yon do not eat very heartily of it, though for the most part you may make a Meal with the sight of the Fare, and be satis∣fied with the steam only, like the Inhabitants of the World in the Moon; your Horses must be sent to a Stablers (for the Change Houses have no Lodging for them) where they may feed voluptuously on Straw only, for Grass is not to be had, and Hay is so much a stranger to them, that they are scarce familiar with the Name of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentry commonly travel from one Friend's House to another, so seldom make use of a Change House; their way is to hire a Horse and a Man for two Pcnce a Mile; they ride on the Horse thirty or forty Miles a day, and the Man who is his Guide, foots it beside him, and carries his Luggage to boot. The best sort keep only a Horse or two for themselves and their best Friend, all the rest of the Train foot it beside them. The Commonalty are so used to worship and adore their Lairds, that when they see a Stranger in any tolerable Equipage, they honour him with the Title of Laird at least, <HI>An't please you my Laird such a one, or an't please you my Laird Dr.</HI> at every ba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e word forsooth.</P>
<P>The Nobility shew themselves very great before Strangers, they are condu∣cted into the House by a many of his Servants, where the Lord with his Troop of Shadows receives them with the grand Paw, then enter into some Discourse of their Countrey, till you are presented with a great Queigh of Syrup of Beer, after
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
that a Glass of White-Wine, then a Rummer of Claret, and sometimes after that a Glass of Sherry Sack, and then begin the round with Ale again, and ply you briskly, for it's their way of shewing you'r Welcome by making you Drunk; if you have longer time to stay, you stick close to Claret, till <HI>Bacchus</HI> wins the Field, and leaves the conquer'd Victims groveling on the place where they re∣ceived their overthrow; at your departure you must drink a <HI>Dongha Doras,</HI> in English a Stirrup Cup, and have the satisfaction to have my Lord's Bag-pipe (with his loud Pipes, with his Lordship's Coat Armor on a Flag) strut about you, and enchant you with a <HI>Loth to depart.</HI></P>
<P>Their Money is commonly <HI>Dollars,</HI> or Mark pieces, coined at <HI>Edenbrough,</HI> but their way of Reckoning is surprising to a Stranger; to receive a Bill of a Hundred Pound in one of their Change-Houses, when one would not suppose they had any of the value of a Hundred Pence; they call a Peny a Shilling, and every Twenty Shillings, <HI>viz.</HI> Twenty Pence, a Pound; so the proportion of their Pound to ours, is Twelve to One. Strangers are sure to be grosly imposed upon in all their Change Houses, and there is no redress for it: If an English∣man should complain to their Magistrates, they would all take a part against him, and make sure to squeeze him.</P>
<P>The Conclusion of the Abridgment of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Chronicle, is the rare and wonderful things of that Countrey; as in <HI>Orkney,</HI> their Ews bring forth two Lambs apiece; that in the Northermost of <HI>Shetland</HI> Islands, about the Summer Solstice, there is no Night; that in the Park of <HI>Cumbernaule,</HI> are white Kine and Oxen; that at <HI>Slanes</HI> there is a putrifying Water in a Cove; that at <HI>Aberdeen</HI> is a Vitriolin Well, that they say is excellent to dissolve the Stone, and expel Sand from the Reins and Bladder, and good for the Colick, being drunk in <HI>July,</HI> &amp;c. These prodigious Wonders in one Countrey are admirable, but these are not half of them. <HI>Loughness</HI> never freezes; in <HI>Lough Lommond</HI> are Fishes without Fins: And 2dly. The Waters thereof rage in great Waves without Wind in calm Weather: And 3dly. and lastly, Therein is a floating Island: In <HI>Kyle</HI> is a deaf Rock twelve Foot every way, yet a Gun discharged on one side of it, shall not be heard to the other. In another place is a Rocking∣stone of a reasonable bigness, that if a Man push it with his finger, it will move very lightly, but if he address his whole Force, it availeth nothing; with many more marvels of like nature, which I would rather believe than go thi∣ther to disprove. To conclude the whole bulk and selvege of this Countrey, is all <HI>Wonder</HI> too great for me to unriddle, there I shall leave it as I found it, with its agreeable Inhabitants in</P>
<L><HI>A Land where one may pray with curst intent:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oh! May they never suffer Banishment.</HI></L>

<HEAD><HI>A Description of</HI> Scotland, <HI>in a LETTER from an Officer in the Army, to his Friend in</HI> London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may be sure it goes hard with a Soldier, when he is brought to his Prayers, and that is my Case and all with me, and would defire my Friends to join with me in them, that God would put it into His Ma∣jesty's Heart to call us out of this Kingdom, and to send us to any other part of the World; for we can't lose by the Change, for here is neither Meat for Man nor Horse; here is great store of Fowl, indeed, as foul Houses, foul Sheets, foul Linnen, foul Dishes, Pots, Trenchers, Napkins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have good store of Fish too, and good for those that can eat it raw; but if it comes once into their hands, it is worse than if it was three days old. For their Butter and Cheese, I will not meddle withal at this time, nor no Man else at any time that loves his Life. The Country, I confess, is good for those that possess it, and too bad for others to be at the Charge to Conquer it. The Air might be wholsome but for the stinking People that inhabit it; the Ground might be fruitful, had they Wit to manure it. They have good store of Deer, but they are so far from the Place where I have been, that I had rather believe than go to disprove it; all the Deer I met withal, was dear Lodgings, dear Horse-Meat, dear Tobacco and <HI>English</HI> Beer. Fruit, for their Grandsire <HI>Adam</HI>'s sake they never planted any, and for other Trees, had Christ been betrayed in this Countrey (as doubtless he should, had he come as a Stranger) <HI>Judas</HI> had sooner found the Grace of Repentance, than a Tree to hang himself on. They have many Hills, wherein they say is much Treasure, but they shew you none of it, Nature hath only discovered to them some Mines of Coal, to shew to what end he created them. There is little Grass to be seen but in their Pottage; and Hay is Heathen Greek to them, nei∣ther Man nor Beast knows what it means. As to their Religion, it is such a Hodge-podge, there is no describing it. Their Sabbath Exercise is a Preaching in the Forenoon, and a Persecuting in the Afternoon; they go to Church in the Forenoon to hear the Law, and to the Craggs and Mountains in the Afternoon to Louze themselves. They hold their Noses, if you talk of Bear-baiting, and stop their Ears, if you speak of a Play. Fornication they hold but a pastime, wherein Man's Ability is approved, and a Woman's Fertility discovered; at Adultery they shake their Heads. Theft they rail at, and think it impossible to lose the way to Heaven, if they can but leave <HI>Rome</HI> behind them. The Ointment they use, is Brimstone and Butter for the Scabs. To conclude; The Men of old did not more wonder that the great <HI>Messias</HI> should be born in so poor a Town as <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> than the World may wonder at, that <HI>England</HI> should have a Race of Kings from such a cursed Countrey as <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Rebel SCOT.</HEAD>
<L>HOW! Providence! and yet a Scottish Crew!</L>
<L>Then Madam Nature wears black Patches too,</L>
<L>What shall our Nation be in bondage thus</L>
<L>Unto a Land that truckles under us?</L>
<L>Ring the Bells backward; I am all on fire,</L>
<L>Not all the Buckets in a Country-Quire</L>
<L>Shall quench my rage. A Poet should be fear'd</L>
<L>When angry, like a Comet's flaming Beard.</L>
<L>And where's the Stoick can his wrath appease</L>
<L>To see his Country sick of <HI>Pym</HI>'s disease;</L>
<L>By Scotch Invasion to be made a Prey</L>
<L>To such Pig-Widgin Myrmidons as they?</L>
<L>But that there's Charm in Verse, I would not quote</L>
<L>The Name of <HI>Scot</HI> without an Antidote;</L>
<L>Unless my head were red, that I might brew</L>
<L>Invention there that might be Poyson too.</L>
<L>Were I a drowzy Judge, whose dismal Note</L>
<L>Disgorgeth Halters, as a Jugler's Throat</L>
<L>Doth Ribbands; Could I in Sir Empericks tone</L>
<L>Speak Pills in phrase and quack destruction,</L>
<L>Or roar like <HI>Marshal</HI> that <HI>Geneva</HI> Bull,</L>
<L>Hell and Damnation a Pulpit full:</L>
<L>Yet to express a <HI>Scot,</HI> to play that prize,</L>
<L>Not all those Mouth Granados can suffice.</L>
<L>Before a <HI>Scot</HI> can properly be curst,</L>
<L>I must like <HI>Hocus,</HI> swallow Daggers first.</L>
<L>Come, keen Iambicks, with your Badgers feet,</L>
<L>And Badger-like bite till your Teeth do meet:</L>
<L>Help ye tart Satyrists to imp my rage</L>
<L>With all the Scorpions that should whip this Age.</L>
<L><HI>Scots</HI> are like Witches; do but whet your Pen;</L>
<L>Scratch till the blood come, they'll not hurt you then.</L>
<L>Now as the Martyrs were enforc'd to take</L>
<L>The shapes of Beasts, like Hypocrites at Stake</L>
<L>I'll bait my <HI>Scot</HI> so, yet not cheat your eyes;</L>
<L>A <HI>Scot,</HI> within a Beast, is no Disguise.</L>
<L>No more let <HI>Ireland</HI> brag, her harmless Nation</L>
<L>Fosters no Venom since that <HI>Scot</HI>'s Plantation:</L>
<L>Nor can our feign'd Antiquity obtain;</L>
<L>Since they came in, <HI>England</HI> hath Wolves again.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="9"/>
The <HI>Scot</HI> that kept the Tower might have shown</L>
<L>Within the Grate of his own Breast alone,</L>
<L>The Leopard and the Panther, and ingross'd</L>
<L>What all those wild Collegiats had cost.</L>
<L>The honest High-shoes in their termly Fees,</L>
<L>First to the Salvage Lawyer, next to these.</L>
<L>Nature her self doth Scotchmen Beasts confess,</L>
<L>Making their Country such a Wilderness;</L>
<L>A Land that brings in question and suspence</L>
<L>God's Omnipresence, but that <HI>Charles</HI> came thence;</L>
<L>But that <HI>Montross</HI> and <HI>Crawford</HI>'s Royal Band</L>
<L>Atton'd their Sin, and Christned half their Land.</L>
<L>Nor is it all the Nation hath these Spots,</L>
<L>There is a Church as well as Kirk of <HI>Scots.</HI></L>
<L>As in a Picture where the squinting paint</L>
<L>Shews Fiend on this side, and on that side Saint.</L>
<L>He that saw Hell in's melancholy Dream,</L>
<L>And in the Twy-light of his Fancy's Theme</L>
<L>Scar'd from his Sins, repented in a fright,</L>
<L>Had he view'd <HI>Scotland</HI> had turn'd Proselite.</L>
<L>A Land where one may pray with curst intent,</L>
<L>Oh may they never suffer Banishment!</L>
<L>Had <HI>Cain</HI> been <HI>Scot,</HI> God would have chang'd his Doom,</L>
<L>Not forc'd him wander but confin'd him home;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Jews</HI> they spread, and as Infection fly,</L>
<L>As if the Devil had Ubiquity.</L>
<L>Hence 'tis they live at Rovers and defie</L>
<L>This, or that place, Rags of Geography.</L>
<L>They'r Citizens o'th' World, they'r all in all,</L>
<L><HI>Scotland</HI>'s a Nation Epidemical.</L>
<L>And yet they ramble not to learn the Mode,</L>
<L>How to be drest, or how to lisp abroad;</L>
<L>To return knowing in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Shrug,</L>
<L>Or which of the <HI>Dutch</HI> States a double Jug</L>
<L>Resembles most in Belly, or in Beard,</L>
<L>(The Card by which the Mariners are steer'd)</L>
<L>No, the <HI>Scots</HI> Errant fight, and fight to eat,</L>
<L>Their Ostrich Stomachs make their Swords their Meat.</L>
<L>Nature with <HI>Scots</HI> as Tooth drawers hath dealt,</L>
<L>Who use to string their Teeth upon their Belt.</L>
<L>Yet wonder not at this their happy choice,</L>
<L>The Serpent's fatal still to Paradise.</L>
<L>Sure <HI>England</HI> hath the Hemorrhoids, and these</L>
<L>On the North postern of the Patient seize,</L>
<L>Like Leeches; thus they Physically thirst</L>
<L>After our Blood, but in the Cure shall burst.</L>
<L>Let them not think to make us run o'th' score</L>
<L>To purchase Villenage, as once before</L>
<L>When an Act past to stroak them on the Head:</L>
<L>Call them good Subjects, buy them Ginger-bread.</L>

<L>They are the Gospel's Life-guard; but for them</L>
<L>(The Garrison of New <HI>Jerusalem)</HI></L>
<L>What would the Brethren do? The Cause! The Cause!</L>
<L>Sack-Possets, and the Fundamental Laws?</L>
<L>Lord! what a godly thing is want of Shirts!</L>
<L>How a Scotch-Stomach, and no Meat converts!</L>
<L>They wanted Food and Rayment; so they took</L>
<L>Religion for their Seamstress, and their Cook.</L>
<L>Unmask them well, their Honours and Estate,</L>

<L>A Laird and twenty pence pronounc'd with noise,</L>
<L>When constru'd but for a plain Yeoman go,</L>

<L>I wrong the Devil should I pick their Bones;</L>
<L>That Dish is his; for when the <HI>Scots</HI> decease</L>
