<HEAD>The landing of PRINCE CHARLES, And the Duke of YORKE IN The Isle of <HI>Jersey,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Hop∣ton,</HI> and 300. other Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, convoyd by 2, States-men of WARRE.</HEAD>
<P>THe Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> since his long and tedious journey from his Native Country, hath with his Councell at St. <HI>Germans</HI> in <HI>France</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouching the next place of his arri∣vall) had severall consultations, (having staid there lon∣ger then welcome) after which consultations he with his bro∣the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and 300 other Gentlemen of quallity betook themselves to hover for a time at Sea, intending for <HI>Jersey,</HI> where they are (as the newes is come) for certaine landed, being convoyed thither by two Statesmen of War, of 35 peeces of Ordnance. Its conceived their intention and Reso∣lution
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> is to be speedily in Ireland, and farther after they shall see cause.</P>
<P>From Dublin. Letters say that the Lord Lieutennant is marched with his whole Army toward Trehah, it being first to be attached, the Governour thereof being Sir Arthur Ashton, formerly Governour of Reading, an old Souldier, &amp; one famous for making good towns and did one once against the King of Sweden to his ad∣miration, this town is fortified as well as his, and as all the Ingineers Ormond had could do it.</P>
<P>The cheef Governour must besiege it on both sides the water, whether he storm it as was his usuall way in England, or make a fotmal siege by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trenching and ap∣proaches time will shew, its mineaqle in most places, the sudden and easie carrying this place wil faciliate the whole worke, if this prove hard, the rest it like to come of so, If any ask why North not South first, its anfwe∣red, that there is good reason for it, for the better acco∣modation by Sea, who will keepe out any thing from the besieged, and furnish the besiegers with food, as to serve them with Biske, Beer; &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Our Armies being at present not enged as we can hear I can inform you but little more for matter of News, only, we have for certaine, that since the advance of the Lord Leiutenant <HI>Crumwell,</HI> divers come from <HI>Inchiqueene,</HI> and that Col. <HI>Went∣worth</HI> is come with 50 horse and men, and there hath benn the like attempt at <HI>Drorhedah,</HI> but not so good successe some being taken and executed.</P>
<P>A Letter from <HI>Chester Sept.</HI> 9. Sir, In my last <HI>I</HI> gave you the glad tydings of the Lord Governours landing in <HI>Ireland,</HI> since which we have not been acq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted with much action in those parts; but the best news at present as we hear is the return of some ships from <HI>Dublin</HI> since the landing of the Lord Leiutenant
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> who specify, that the Lord Governour marched on Satturday last from <HI>Dublin,</HI> its generally beleeved he is marched towards Tredah, and the Letters say, They hope it is taken by this time, and that they question not but that before this comes, to hand their will be some action, and further say that they do not beleive the enemies strength so great as they bragg off.</P>
<P>We also hear that divers of Prince <HI>Ruperts</HI> men do often desert him so that he hath not Seamen with him, to man above 3 of his best ships, But there are not yet come any letters from our Navy before <HI>Kingsale.</HI> since the late great winds</P>
<P>By Letters from <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was this day certified, That some <HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> ships passed by the Islands of <HI>Orkney,</HI> towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Isle of <HI>Pha∣roe,</HI> one of the ships belonging to the Parl. of <HI>England</HI> chased them, &amp; some of them ran on the Coasts of <HI>Scotland.</HI> That on those Coasts in <HI>Scotland,</HI> ly 2 Armies, one for the <HI>Kirk,</HI> and one for the State, who look for the landing of Forces from <HI>Montrosse,</HI> whom they heare is gathe∣ring of Forces in <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweaden,</HI> by himself and his Agents to come against them, yet some of the <HI>Scots</HI> Souldiers were very abusive.</P>
<P>From <HI>Yarmouth</HI> came thus, that Captaine <HI>Coppin</HI> with the <HI>Greyhound</HI> set at liberty a vessel that had been taken by 4 <HI>Dunkerk</HI> men of Warre, who after turning out all het men, puting only 5 into her, were sending her to <HI>Ostend,</HI> he also chased an <HI>Irish</HI> Frigot a long time, but the wind being extream high, and the storme increasing he was forced so let fall all his sales, or he had been over set, but he see her hover on the sands, and its thought she got not off againe. This day we had Intelligence that the Garrison of <HI>Oxford</HI> was in some distemper being seduced, partly by the discontented people of the Levelling faction, and partly by the Cavaliers who drive on their interest by complying and fomenting their discon∣tents. The Souldiers there have drawn up certaine Proposals, The sub∣stance is, for a new Representative, &amp;c. These men are now quell'd, and the house having notice thereof, and that certain Agents from London are apprehended, who had blown up the min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of these poore souls in∣to thoughts of being restorers of their Country, who know how to settle the Nation better then ever it was, these are to be called to account, and proceeded against, and a Declaration speedily to goe forth for to un∣deceive.</P>

<P>The Souldiers <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Oxford (as we are informed by letters from thence have drawn up eight Proposals to this effesh <HI>viz.</HI> for the chusing of a new Representative and disolving this, and for electing Agitators.

<P>This afternoone Col. <HI>Tomblinsou</HI> and Col. <HI>Euglisby</HI> were dispatched towards <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>From high <HI>Wickam</HI> we understand, that some turbulent spirits affron∣ted the Mayor who imprisoning some of them, with other of their con∣fede ates broke the prison, and after came dairing the mayor to his face,</P>
<P><HI>Sunday Sept</HI> 9.

<P>THe Miners of this County seeme much discontented at some procee∣dings of Parl. and especilly in their own busines, they have had this weeke severall meetings, and we are informed to draw up a Declaration against the present Authority, upon publication whereof they intend to be ready to maintain with their lives and fortunes, and likewise the A∣greement of the people. And if this fire should unhappyly break out, I fear it would not be easily quenched, but prove to the ruin of the whole Na∣tion, which the Lord prevent, and incline the hearts of all to justice, love and peace.</P>
<P><HI>Windsor Sept.</HI> 10. The Major of <HI>Wickam</HI> complained lately to the Go∣vernour of this Castle against some of the Souldiers, that offered many incivillities, and high affronts to him; some whereof he had but the day before committed, and the prison door broke open by the Levellers com∣ing that way, The Governour resolved, and hath promised him all the assistance he can against them if they come the next Market day; and then it is possible they will be snapt.</P>

<P>FRom <HI>Oxford</HI> came thus; <HI>Sir,</HI> The Levelling party doth much resort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o these quarters, since this Garrison hath revolted from the Parliament, Horse and foot come in night and day in great numbers, but we hear that will be soone prevented by some of the Asmies horse, that are appointed to straighten their quarters. Their Councell consisted most of private souldiers at first, but since some head-peeces are come from <HI>London</HI> to joyn with them, They talk of other Garrisons that will joyn with them, and that they doubt not but to have an offensive Field Army before six weeks be ended, we heare they are framing a Remonstrance for the recove∣ry of <HI>Englands</HI> lost freedoms, and for ease of the people from Burthens and oppressions, for obtaining whereof (they say) they are resolved, to hazard their lives and Fortunes.</P>
<P>There came further this day that the Souldiery have seized on the 4. Gentlemen sent down to appease them, and that Col. <HI>Inglesby</HI> himself is secured by his own Souldiers in <HI>Oxon,</HI> but of this little certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
