<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, or PARLY, continued betwixt <HI>Partricius</HI> and <HI>Peregrine</HI> (upon their landing in <HI>France</HI>) touching the civill Wars of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Entle Sir, you are happily arrived on this shore; we are now upon firme ground, upon the faire <HI>Continent</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> we are not circumscrib'd or coopt up within the narrow bounds of a rheumatick <HI>Island;</HI> we have all <HI>Europe</HI> before us. Truely I am not a little glad to have shaken hands with that tumbling Element the <HI>Sea;</HI> And for <HI>England,</HI> I never intend to see her againe, unlesse it be in a <HI>Map;</HI> nay, <HI>In statu quo nunc,</HI> while this <HI>Faction</HI> reignes, had I left one eye be∣hind me, I should hardly returne thither to fetch it; therefore if I be missing at any time, never looke for me there. There is an old Proverb, <HI>From a blacke German, a white Italian, a red French∣man,</HI> I may adde one member more, and, <HI>from a Round-headed Englishman, The Lord deliver us.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Partricius.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often crossed these Seas, and I found my selfe alwayes pitifully sicke; I did ever and anone tell what <HI>Wood</HI> the Ship was made of; but in this passage I did not feele the least motion or distemper in my humors: for, indeed I had no time to thinke on sicknesse, I was so wholly taken up, and transported with such a pleasing conceit, to have left yonder miserable <HI>Island.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pereg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miserable <HI>Island</HI> indeed; for I thinke there was ne∣ver such a tyrannie exercised in any Christian Countrey under
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> Heaven; a tyrannie that extends not onely to the <HI>body,</HI> but the <HI>braine</HI> also; not only to mens fortunes and estates, but it reaches to their very soules and consciences, by violented new coercive Oaths and Protestations, compos'd by Lay-men, inconsistent with the liberty of Christians. Never was there a Nation car∣ried away by such a strong spirit of delusion; never was there a poore people so purblinded and <HI>Puppified,</HI> if I may say so, as I finde them to be; so that I am at a stand with my selfe, whether I shall <HI>pitie</HI> them more, or <HI>laugh</HI> at them. They not onely kisse the stone that hurts them, but the hands of them that hurle it; they are come to that passive stupidity, that they adore their very persecutors, who from <HI>polling</HI> fall now a shaving them, and will flay them at last, if they continue this popular reigne. I cannot compare <HI>England,</HI> as the case stands with her, more pro∣perly, then to a poore beast, sicke of the staggers, who cannot be cur'd without an incision. The Astronomers, I remember, affirme that the <HI>Moone</HI> (which predominates over all humid bodies) hath a more powerfull influence o're your <HI>British</HI> Seas then any other; so that according to the observation of some <HI>Navigators,</HI> they swell at a spring tide in some places, above threescore cubits high: I am of opinion, that that inconstant humorous <HI>Planet,</HI> hath also an extraordinany dominion over the <HI>braines</HI> of the Inhabitants; for when they attempt any Innova∣tion (whereunto all <HI>Insulary</HI> people are more subject then other Citizens of the world which are fixed upon the <HI>Continent</HI>) they swell higher, their fancies worke stronglier, and so commit stranger extravagancies then any other: witnesse these mon∣strous barbarismes and violences, which have been, and are daily offered to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Iustice,</HI> (the two grand supporters of all States) yea, to humane <HI>Reason</HI> it selfe, since the beginning of these tumults.</P>
<P>And now, noble Sir, give me leave to render you my humble thanks for that true and solid information you pleased to give me in <HI>London</HI> of these commotions.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>During my short sojourne there, I lighted on divers odde Pamphlets upon the <HI>Seamstresses</HI> stalls, whom I wondred to see selling <HI>Paper</HI> sheets in lieu of <HI>Holland:</HI> one the one side I found the most impudent untruths (vouch'd by publike authority) the basest scurrillities, and poorest gingles of wit, that ever I read in my life; on the other side I met with many pieces that had good stuffe in them, but gave mee not (being a stranger) a full satisfaction, they look'd no further then the beginning of this Parliament, and the particular emergences thereof: But you have, by your methodicall relation, so perfectly instructed and rectified my understanding, by bringing mee to the very source of these distempers, and led me all along the side of the current by so streight a line, that I believe, whosoever will ven∣ture upon the most intricate task of penning the story of these <HI>vertiginous</HI> times, will find himselfe not a little beholden to that piece, which, in deed may be term'd a short <HI>Chronicle</HI> rather then a <HI>Relation.</HI> Wee are come now under another clime, and here we may mingle words, and vent our conceptions more se∣curely, it being, as matters stand, in your Countrey, more safe to speake under the <HI>Lilly</HI> then the <HI>Rose;</HI> wee may here take in, and put out freer ayre; I meane, we may discourse with more liberty: for, <HI>words are nought els but ayre articulated, and coagula∣ted, as it were, into letters and syllables.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I deserve not these high expressions of your favou∣rable censure touching that poore piece; but this I will be bold to say; That whosoever doth reade it impartially, will discover in the Author the <HI>Genius</HI> of an honest Patriot, and a Gentleman. And now me thinks I looke on you unfortunate <HI>Island,</HI> as if one did looke upon a Ship toss'd up and downe in distresse of wind and weather, by a furious tempest, which the more she tugs and wrastles with the foamie waves of the angry Ocean, the more the fury of the storme encreaseth, and puts her in danger of shipwrack; and you must needs thinke, Sir, it would move compassion in any heart, to behold a poore Ship
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> in such a desperate case, specially when all his <HI>kindred, friends</HI> and <HI>fortunes;</HI> yea, his <HI>Religion,</HI> the most precious Treasure of all, are aboard of her, and upon point of sincking. Alas I can contribute nothing now to my poore countrey but my prayers and teares, that it would please God to allay this tempest, and cast over board those that are the true causers of it, and bring the people to the right use of <HI>Reason</HI> againe. It was well ob∣served by you, Sir, That there is a Nationall kinde of indispo∣sition, and obliquity of mind that rageth now amongst our people, and I feare it will be long ere they returne to their old <HI>English</HI> temper, to that rare loyalty and love which they were used to shew to their Soveraigne: for all the Principles of Monarchie are quite lost amongst us, those ancient and sacred flowers of the <HI>English</HI> Diadem are trampled under foot; nay, matters are come to that horrid confusion, that not onely the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of the Crowne, but the foundamentall <HI>Priviledge</HI> of the free-borne subject is utterly overthrowne, by those whose Predecessors were used to be the main supporters of it. so that our King is necessitated to put himself in Armes for the preser∣vation not only of his own Regall rights, but of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> it selfe, which was never so invaded and violated in any age, by such causlesse tyrannicall imprisonments, by such unexampled destructive taxes; by stopping the ordinary processes in Law, and awing all the Courts of Justice, by unheard of forced oaths and Associations, and a thousand other acts, which neither <HI>pre∣sident, Book case</HI> or <HI>Statute</HI> can warrant, whereof, if the King had done but the twentieth part, hee had been cryed up to be the greatest Tyrant that ever was.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pereg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am an <HI>Alien,</HI> and so can speake with more free∣dome of your Countrey. The short time that I did eate my bread there, I felt the pulse of the people with as much judge∣ment as I could; and I find, that this very word <HI>Parliament</HI> is become a kind of <HI>Idoll</HI> amongst them, they doe, as it were pin their salvation upon't; it is held blasphemie to speake against
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> it. The old <HI>English</HI> Maxime was: <HI>The King can doe no wrong;</HI> another Nominative case is now stept in; <HI>That the Parliament can do no wrong,</HI> nor the <HI>King receive any:</HI> And whereas there was used to be but one Defender of the <HI>Faith,</HI> there are now started up amongst you, I cannot tell how many hundreds of them. And as in the sacred profession of <HI>Priest-hood</HI> wee hold, or at leastwise should hold, That after the <HI>Imposition</HI> of hands, the Minister is inspired with the Holy Ghost in an extraordinary manner for the enabling of him to exercise that Divine Functi∣on: so the <HI>English</HI> are growne to such a fond conceit of their <HI>Parliament</HI> members, that as soone as any is chosen by the con∣fus'd cry of the Common people to sit within the walls of that House, an inerring spirit, a spirit of infallibility presently en∣tereth into him (so that he is thereby become like the <HI>Pope,</HI> a <HI>Canon animatus</HI>) though some of them may haply be such flat and simple animals, that they are as fit to be Counsellors there, as <HI>Caligula's</HI> Horse was to be <HI>Consull,</HI> as the Historian tells us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Touching <HI>Parliament,</HI> there breaths not a Subject un∣der <HI>Englands</HI> Crowne, who hath a higher esteeme of it then I, it makes that dainty mixture in our government of <HI>Monarchie, Optimacie</HI> and <HI>Democracy,</HI> betwixt whom, though there be a kind of <HI>co-ordination</HI> of power during the sitting of <HI>Parliament,</HI> yet the two last, which are composed of Peers and People, have no power, but what is derived from the first, which may be called the soul that animates them, and by whose authority they meet, consult and depart: They come there to <HI>propose,</HI> not to <HI>impose</HI> Lawes; they come not to make Lawes by the sword; they must not be like <HI>Draco's</HI> Lawes, written in blood. Their <HI>King</HI> calls them thither to be his Counsellors, not Controllers; and the Office of Counsell is to advise, not to inforce; they come thi∣ther to <HI>intreat,</HI> not to <HI>treat</HI> with their Liege Lord; they come to throw their <HI>Petitions</HI> at his feet, that so they may find a way to his heart.</P>
<P>'Tis true, I have read of high things that our <HI>Parliaments</HI> have
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> done, but 'twas either during the nonage and minority of our Kings, when they were under protectorship, or when they were absent in a forraigne war, or in time of confusion, when there were competitors of the blood-royall for the Crowne, and when the number of both Houses was compleat and individed; but I never reade of any <HI>Parliament</HI> that did arrogate to it selfe such a power <HI>Paramount,</HI> such a <HI>Superlative superintendence,</HI> as to checke the Prerogative of their Soveraigne, to question his <HI>ne∣gative</HI> voyce, to passe things, not onely without, but expresly against his advice and royall command: I never heard of <HI>Par∣liament,</HI> that would have their King, being come to the <HI>meri∣dian</HI> of his age, to transmit his intellectualls, and whole fa∣culty of reason to them. I finde some <HI>Parliaments</HI> have been so modest and moderate <HI>(And moderation is the Rudder that should steere the course of all great Councells)</HI> that they have de∣clined the agitation and cognizance of some state affaires, hum∣bly transferring them to their Soveraigne and his privie Coun∣sell: a <HI>Parliament man</HI> then, held it to be the <HI>adaequate</HI> object of his duty, to study the welfare, to redresse the grievances, and supply the defects of that place for which he served; the <HI>Bur∣geois</HI> of <HI>Linne</HI> studied to find out something that might advance the trade of <HI>Fishing;</HI> he of <HI>Norwich,</HI> what might advantage the making of <HI>Stuffe;</HI> he of <HI>Rye,</HI> what might preserve their <HI>Harbour</HI> from being choaked up with <HI>Sand;</HI> he of <HI>Taveston,</HI> what might further the <HI>Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Kerseyes,</HI> and they thought to have complyed with the <HI>Obligation,</HI> and discharged the consciences of honest Patriots, without soaring above their reach, and ro∣ving at randome to treat of universals, to bring Religion to their barre, to prie into the <HI>Arcana Imperii,</HI> the cognizance of the one belonging to the King, and his interne Counsell of State: the other to <HI>Divines,</HI> who, according to the <HI>Etymologie</HI> of the <HI>word,</HI> use to be still conversant in the exercise and speculation of holy and heavenly things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pereg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am clearely of your opinion in these two particu∣lars;
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> for, <HI>secrecie being the soule of policie,</HI> matters of State should be communicated but to few; and touching Religion, I can∣not see how it may <HI>quadrat</HI> with the calling, and be <HI>homogene∣ous</HI> to the profession of Laymen, to determine matters of Divi∣nity, who, out of their incapacity and unaptnesse to the worke, being not <HI>pares negotio;</HI> and being carried away by a wilde kind of <HI>Conscience</HI> without <HI>Science,</HI> like a Ship without a Helme, fall upon dangerous quick-sands; so that whilest they labour to mend her, they mar her, whilst they thinke to settle her, they confound her, whilest they plot to prevent the growth of <HI>Poperie,</HI> they pauce the way to bring it in, by conniving at, and countenancing those monstrous Schismes, I observed to have crept into your Chruch since the <HI>reigne</HI> of this <HI>Parliament:</HI> so that one may justly say, These your <HI>Reformers</HI> are but the exe∣cutioners of the old project of the Jesuits, the main part where∣of was, and is still, to hurle the ball of discord, and hatch new opinions still 'twixt the <HI>Protestants,</HI> to make fractions and scissures betweene them, and so render their Religion more despicable and ridiculous.</P>
<P>But me thinks, matters are come to a strange passe with you in <HI>England,</HI> that the <HI>Iudges</HI> cannot be trusted with the <HI>Law,</HI> nor the <HI>Prelats</HI> with the <HI>Gospell;</HI> whereas from all times, out of their long experience and yeeres, these two degrees were of men used to be reverenced for the chiefe <HI>Ttruch-men,</HI> and unquestionable <HI>Expositors</HI> of both, which another power seemes now to arro∣gate to it selfe, as the inerring <HI>Oracle</HI> of both: but I pray God that these grand <HI>Refiners</HI> of Religion, prove not <HI>Quacksalvers</HI> at last; that these upstart <HI>Polititians</HI> prove not <HI>Impostors:</HI> for I have heard of some things they have done, that if <HI>Machiavell</HI> himselfe were alive, he would be reputed a Saint in comparison of them. The <HI>Roman</HI> ten, and <HI>Athenian</HI> thirty, were Babies to these; nay, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Inquisition, and the <HI>Bloet-Rade</HI> (that Councell of blood) which the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> erected in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> when he swore, <HI>That hee would drowne the Hollanders in
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> their Butter-tubs,</HI> was nothing to this; when I consider the pro∣digious power they have assumed to themselves, and doe daily exercise over the bodies, the estates and soules of men.</P>
<P>In your former Discourse you told me, that amongst multi∣tudes of other mischiefs, which this new Faction hath wrought, they have put <HI>division</HI> twixt all sorts and sexes, twixt all con∣ditions, both of men and women; one thing more I may say they have done in this kind: for, they have laboured to put <HI>division</HI> between the <HI>Persons</HI> of the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> by making the first <HI>Person</HI> to be offended at that voluntary <HI>genuflexion</HI> and reve∣rence which hath been from all times practised in the Christi∣an Church to the name of the second <HI>Person;</HI> so that <HI>Iesu-war∣ship,</HI> as I have read in some of your profane Pamphlets, is growne now to be a word of reproach amongst you.</P>
<P>But to the point; there is one thing I can never cease to wonder at: that whereras at the beginning of this <HI>Parliament,</HI> there were as able and experienced, as stout and well spoken Gentlemen, as any in the whole Kingdome, that sate in the House, and made the far major part, I wonder I say, that they would suffer this giddy-headed Faction to carry all before them in that violent manner, that they did not crush this <HI>Cocatrice</HI> in the shell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, Sir, you know there is nothing so agreeable to the nature of man, as <HI>noveltie;</HI> and in the conduct of humane affaires, it is alwayes seene, that when any new designe or facti∣on is afoot, the Projectors are commonly more pragmaticall and sedulous upon the worke; they lie centinell to watch all advantages, the Sand of their braines is alwayes running this hath caused, this upstart Faction, to sticke still close toge∣ther, and continue marvellously constant to their ends; they have been used to tyre and out-fast, to weary and out-watch the moderate and well-minded Gentlemen; sometimes till after midnight, by clancular and nocturnall sittings; so that as his Majestie sayes in one of his Declarations, most of their Votes
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> may be said to be nought else, but <HI>Verdicts of a starv'd Iury.</HI></P>
<P>Another reason is, That they countenanced the flocking to∣gether of the promiscuous rabble from <HI>London,</HI> notwithstan∣ding the two severall motions the Lords made unto them, that they might be suppressed by Parliamentary Order: This rio∣ous crue awed the wonted freedome of speech in both Houses, cryed up the names, and confronted many of their Members: yet these new Polititians not onely conniv'd at them, but call'd them their <HI>friends;</HI> and so they might well enough, or rather their <HI>Champions;</HI> for they had ordered the matter so, that they were sure to have them ready at their devotion, at the heaving of a finger: and from this tumultuous <HI>mongrell crue,</HI> they de∣rived their first encouragements to doe such high prodigious insolencies they have committed since. Adde hereunto, that they complyed exceedingly besides with the Common <HI>Councell</HI> of the City, they used to attend them earely and late, and knock heads together; and if any new thing was to passe in the House, they would first wait on <HI>them,</HI> to know their pleasure, and af∣terwards it should be propunded and put to <HI>Vote</HI> in the House: And how derogatory it is to the high <HI>Law-making councell,</HI> to make their chiefest Members wait from time to time on the Magistrates of <HI>the City,</HI> who in former times were used to at∣tend them upon all occasions in <HI>Westminster,</HI> I am ashamed to thinke on; nor am I lesse ashamed to remember those base <HI>Ar∣tifices</HI> and indirect courses that were practis'd at the election of this pretended <HI>Major;</HI> here they tack'd about to a second choyce after the the first was legally made, and how the <HI>Com∣mon-Councell</HI> was pack'd up of the arrandest <HI>Schismaticks</HI> up and downe the <HI>City.</HI> And to that mutinous wealth-swolne City, and the said unbridled packe of <HI>Oppidans</HI> (seconded afterwards by the Countrey clownes) who offered such outrages to <HI>Gods House,</HI> the <HI>Kings house,</HI> and the <HI>Parliament house,</HI> may be ascri∣bed all our miseries, and the miscarriage of things: for they caused his Majesty to forsake his owne standing palace, to ab∣sent
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> himselfe from his <HI>Parliament,</HI> and make that unusuall pro∣gresse up and downe his Kingdome ever since, it put all Coun∣sell at a stand, and in a confusion: But because the businesse may take better impression in you for the further illustration of it, I will relate unto you an old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Fable which comes pat to this purpose:</P>
<Q>Upon a time, the Starres complained to <HI>Apollo,</HI> that hee displayed his beames too much upon some malignant Planets; That the <HI>Moone</HI> had too great a share of his influence, and that he was carryed away too much by her motion: They complained also, that the constellation of <HI>Libra</HI> (which holds the ballance of Iustice) had but a dim light, and that the <HI>Astrean</HI> Court was growne altogether destructive with divers other grievances. <HI>Apollo</HI> hereupon, commanded <HI>Mercury</HI> to summon a generall Synod, where some out of every Asterisme throughout the whole Firmament were to meet; <HI>Apollo</HI> told them, I am placed here by the finger of the Almigh∣ty, to be Monarch of the Skie, to be the measurer of Time, and I goe upon his errand round about the world every foure and twenty houres: I am also the Fountaine of heat and light, which, though I use to dispence and difo¦fuse in equall proportions throughout the whole universe; yet I make dif∣ference twixt objects, a Castle hath more of my light then a Cottage, and the Cedar hath more of me then the Shrub: But touching the <HI>Moone,</HI> (the second great Luminary) I would have you know, that she is dearest unto me, therefore let none repine that I cherish her with my beames, and confer more light on her, then upon any other. Touching the malignant Planets, or any other Star, of what magnitude soever, that moves not in a regular motion, or hath runne any excentrique exorbitant course, or that would have made me to move out of the <HI>Zodiak,</HI> I put them over unto you, that upon due examination, and proofe, they may be <HI>unsphear'd,</HI> or extinguished. But I would have this done with moderation; I would have you to k epe as neere as you can between the <HI>Tropiques</HI> and tempe∣rate <HI>Zones:</HI> I would have things reduced to their true principles, <HI>refor∣med, not ruin'd;</HI> I would not have the whole government of the Skie overturned for redresse of a few petty abuses; I would have the spirit of malice and lying, the spirit of partiality and injustice, the spirit of tyran∣ny and rigor, the base spirit of feare and jealousie to be far from this glo∣rious Synod; I would have all private interests reflecting upon revenge or profit, to be utterly banished hence: moreover, I would not have you
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> to make grievances, where no grievances are, or dangers, where no dan∣gers are, I would have no creation of dangers; I would have you to hus∣band time as parsimoniously as you can, lest by keeping too long together, and amusing the world with such tedious hopes of redresse of grievances, you prove your selves the greatest grievance at last, and so from <HI>Starres,</HI> become <HI>Comets:</HI> Lastly, I would have you to be very cautious how you tamper with my Soveraigne power, and chop Logick with mee in that point; you know what became of <HI>Him,</HI> who once presumed to meddle with my Chariot: Hereupon the whole host of Heaven being <HI>constellated</HI> thus into one great Body, fell to a serious deliberation of things; and <HI>Apollo</HI> himselfe continued his presence, and sate amongst them in his full lustre, but in the meane time, whilest they were in the middest of their consulta∣tions, the lesser sort of the mongrell Starres which make up the <HI>Galaxia</HI> (the milkie way in Heaven) gather in a tumultuous disorderly manner about the body of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and commit many strange insolencies, which caused <HI>Apollo</HI> (taking young <HI>Phosphorus</HI> with him) to retyre himselfe, and to withdraw his light from the Synod: so all began to be involv'd in a strange kinde of confusion and obscurity; they groaped in the darke, not knowing which way to move, or what course to take, all things went <HI>Can∣cerlike,</HI> retrograde, because the <HI>Sunne</HI> detained his beames from them?</Q>
<P>Such as the <HI>Sun</HI> is in the Firmament, a <HI>Monarch</HI> is in his Kingdome: for, <HI>as the Wisest of men</HI> saith, <HI>In the light of the Kings countenance there is life,</HI> and I believe that to be the <HI>morall</HI> of this Astrean <HI>Fable.</HI></P>

And truly, as you say, I am al∣so clearely of opinion, that these ingratefull <HI>Londoners,</HI> as they were the <HI>comencers,</HI> so have they been the <HI>continuers</HI> and <HI>contri∣vers</HI> of this ugly <HI>Rebellion</HI> ever since; They seeme to have ut∣terly forgotten who hath given them the sword, and by, and from whom they hold their <HI>Charter.</HI> Their <HI>Corporations</HI> are now growne body politicks, and so many petty <HI>Republikes</HI> amongst them; so that they begin to smell ranke of a <HI>Hans-town,</HI> Poore simple <HI>Annimals,</HI> how they suffer their pockets to be pick'd, their purses to be cut; how they part with their <HI>vitall spi∣rits</HI> every week; how desperatly they post on to <HI>poverty,</HI> and their owne <HI>ruine,</HI> suffering themselves in lieu of <HI>Scarlet-gownes,</HI> to be governed by a rude company of <HI>Red-coats,</HI> who 'twixt <HI>plundring, assessements,</HI> and <HI>visits,</HI> will quickly make an end of them. I feare there is some formidable judgement of regall revenge hangs over that City; for the anger of a King is like the roa∣ring of a Lyon; and I never read yet of any City that contested
<PB N="13" REF="9"/> with her Soveraigne, but she smarted soundly for it at last. The present case of <HI>London</HI> beares a great deale of proportion with that of <HI>Monpellier</HI> here in <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh's time; for when that towne had refused the publishing of ma∣ny of the Kings <HI>Edicts</HI> and <HI>Declarations,</HI> murthered some of his Ministers and Servants, abused the Church, and committed other high acts of insolencie; the Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> was sent to re∣duce the towne to obedience, the Duke pressed them with so hard asiege, that at last 600. of the best Citizens came forth in procession, bare-headed, and bare-footed, with white wands in their hands, and halters about their necks, to deliver the keys of all the gates to the Duke, but this would not serve the turne, for two hundred of them were condemned to the gallies, two hun∣dred of them were hang'd, and two hundred beheaded, the King saying, he offered those as <HI>victimes</HI> for the lives of his servants whom they had murthered with the false sword of Justice.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I much marvell how your Church-government, which from all times hath been cryed up to be so exact, is so suddenly tumbled into this confusion? how your Prelates are fallen under so darke a cloud, considering that divers of them were renowned through all the Reform'd Churches in <HI>Christen∣dome</HI> for their rare learning and pietie? At the <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Dort,</HI> you know, some of them assisted, and no exception at all taken at their degree and dignity; how came it to passe, that they are now fallen under this Eclypse, as to be so persecuted, to be push'd out of the House of Peers, and hurried into prison? I pray you be pleased to tell me.</P>

<P>Sir, I remember to have read in the <HI>Irish</HI> Story, That when the Earle of <HI>Kildare,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time, was brought before the Lord <HI>Deputy</HI> for burning <HI>Cassiles</HI> Church, he answered, <HI>My Lord, I would never have burnt the Church, un∣lesse I had thought the Bishop had been in it;</HI> for 'twas not the Church, but the Bishop I aim'd at. One may say so of the <HI>Anglican</HI> Church at this present, that these fierie <HI>Zelots,</HI> these
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> vaporing <HI>Sciolists</HI> of the times are so furiously enraged against this holy <HI>Primitive</HI> order: some out of <HI>Envie,</HI> some out of <HI>Ma∣lice,</HI> some out of <HI>Ignorance,</HI> that one may say, our Church had not been thus set on fire, unlesse the Bishops had been in't. I grant there was never yet any Profession made up of men, but there were some bad; we are not Angels upon earth; there was a <HI>Iudas</HI> amongst the first dozen of <HI>Christians,</HI> though Apostles, and they by our <HI>Saviour's</HI> owne election: Amongst our Pre∣lates, peradventure (for I know of no accusation fram'd against them yet) some might be faultie, and wanting moderation, be∣ing not contented to walk upon the battlements of the Church, but they must put themselves upon stilts; but if a golden chaine hath happily a copper linke, two or three, will you therefore breake and throw away the whole chaine. If a few <HI>Shooe-makers</HI> (I confesse the comparison is too homely, but I had it of a <HI>Scots</HI> Doctor) sell Calfes skin for Neats leather, must the <HI>Gentle-Craft</HI> be therefore utterly extinguish'd, and must wee goe barefoot therefore? Let the persons suffer in the Name of God, and not the holy Order of <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> But because you de∣sire to be further informed of the procedures against Bishops, I will relate unto you another Apologue which principally glaunceth at this subject:</P>
<Q><P>Upon a time the <HI>Birds</HI> met in Councell, for redresse of some extrava∣vagancies that had <HI>flowne</HI> into the <HI>volatill</HI> Empire; Nor was it the first time that <HI>Birds</HI> met thus; for the <HI>Phrygian Fabler</HI> tells us of divers meetings of theirs: And after him we reade that <HI>Apolonius Thyanent,</HI> undertook the interpretation of their language, and to be their <HI>Dragoman.</HI></P>
<P>They thus assembled in one great <HI>Covie</HI> by the call of the <HI>Eagle</HI> their unquestioned hereditary King, and by vertue of his royall authority. Com∣plaints were brought, that divers <HI>Cormorants</HI> and <HI>Harpies,</HI> with other <HI>Birds</HI> of prey, had got in amongst them, who did much annoy and invade the publique liberty: sundrie other <HI>Birds</HI> were questioned, which caused <HI>some</HI> to take a timely flight into another ayre.</P>
<P>As they were thus consulting for advancement of the common good,
<PB N="15" REF="10"/> many <HI>Rookes, Horne-Owles</HI> and <HI>Sea-guls</HI> flock'd together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Citizens, Sea-men.</NOTE> and fluttered about the place they were assembled in, where they kept a hideous noyse, and committed many outrages, and nothing could satisfie them, but the <HI>Griffons</HI> head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ear. <HI>Straff.</HI> Crest.</NOTE> which was therefore chopt off and offered up as a sacrifice to make them leave their <HI>chattering,</HI> and appease their fury for the time.</P>
<P>They fell foule afterwards upon the <HI>Pies,</HI> who were used to be much reverenced, and to sit upon the highest <HI>pearch</HI> in that great Assembly: they called them Idolatrous and inauspicious <HI>Birds,</HI> they hated their mixt colour, repined at their long traine, they tore their white feathers, and were ready to peck out their eyes: they did what they could to put them in <HI>Owles</HI> feathers, to make them the more hated, and to be star'd and hooted at wheresoever they passed. The <HI>Pies</HI> being thus scar'd, presented a Petition to the royall <HI>Eagle,</HI> and to this his great Counsell, that they might be secured to repaire safely thither to sit and consult, according to the ancient Lawes of the <HI>Volatill</HI> Empire continued so many ages without controllment or question: in which Petition they inserted a <HI>Protest</HI> or <HI>Caveat,</HI> that no publike Act passe should in the interim. This Supplication, both for matter and forme, was excepted against, and cryed up to be high Treason, specially that indefinite <HI>Protest</HI> they had made, that no Act what∣soever should be of any validity without them, which was alledged to dero∣gate frrom the High Law-making power of that great Counsell, and ten∣ded to retard and disturb the great affaires which were then in agitation: so the poore <HI>Pies,</HI> as if by that Petition they had like the <HI>Black-bird</HI> voy∣ded Lime to catch themselves, for <HI>Turdus cacat sibi malum,</HI> were sud∣denly hurried away into a Cage, and after ten long Moneths canvassing of the point, they were <HI>unpearch'd,</HI> and rendred for ever uncapable to be mem∣bers of that Court, they were strucke dumb and voyce-lesse, and suddenly blowne up away thence without any force of <HI>powder,</HI> as once was plotted against them. But this was done when a thin number of <HI>Birds</HI> had kept still together, and stuck close against them, and after that the Bill con∣cerning them had been once ejected, which they humbly conceived by the ancient order of that Court could not be re-admitted in the same Session. They Petitioned from the place they were cooped in, that for heavens sake, for the honour of that noble Counsell, for truth and justice sake, they be∣ing as free-borne Denisons of the ayre Region, as any other <HI>Volatils</HI> what∣soever, their charge might be perfected, that so they might be brought to a legall triall, and not forced to languish in such captivity. They pleaded to have done nothing but what they had precedents for: And touching the <HI>Caveat</HI> they had inserted, it was a thing usuall in every inferiour Court
<PB N="16" REF="11"/> of Judicature, and had they then forborne to have done it, they <HI>had berayed their owne nest,</HI> and done wrong to their successors. It was affirmed they had beene members of that Body politique, long before those <HI>lower pearch'd Birds,</HI> who now would cast them out; and that they had been their best friends to introduce them to have any thing to doe in that generall Counsell. they prayed they might not be so cruelly used, as the <HI>Solan-goose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scot.</NOTE> and <HI>Redshanke</HI> had used them, who were not content to <HI>braile</HI> and <HI>clip</HI> their wings onely, but to <HI>seare</HI> them so that they should never grow againe; to handle them so unmercifully, was not the way to make their adversaries <HI>Birds of Paradise:</HI> In fine, they advised them to re∣member what the sicke <HI>Kite's</HI> mother answered him, when he desired her to pray to the gods for him, <HI>How canst thou, said she expect any good from the gods, whose temples thou hast so often violated?</HI> At last, upon the importunity and pitifulnesse of their Petitions, the accusation of <HI>Treason,</HI> which kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such a noyse at first, being declined against them, they were re∣leased in the morning, but cooped up againe before night: and after the revolution of foure full Moones, they were restored againe to a conditionall liberty, under which they remaine till this day.</P>
<P>There wants not some, who affirme, that in this great Counsell of <HI>Birds.</HI> there were some <HI>Decoyes,</HI> (and 'tis well knowne <HI>where Decoyes</HI> were first bred) who called in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holland.</NOTE> not only these mongrell obstreperous <HI>Birds</HI> from abroad to commit such outrages as were spoken of before, but drew after them al∣so many of the greatest <HI>Birds,</HI> who sate in that Assembly, to follow them whither they listed: Others, who were of a more <HI>generous</HI> extraction, disdained to be such <HI>Buzzards,</HI> as to be carried away hood-wincked in that manner, to be <HI>Birds</HI> of their feather. Thus a visible faction was hatched in this great Counsell; as if the said <HI>Decoyes</HI> had disgorged and let fall some graines of <HI>Hemlock</HI> seeds amongst them: Or, as if some <HI>Spinturnix,</HI> that fatall incendiary <HI>Bird,</HI> or some ill-boding <HI>Scrich-Owle,</HI> which as Stories tell us appeared once at <HI>Rome,</HI> in a famous, though unfortunate great Councell (when there was a schisme in the Pope dome) had appeared also here. There wanted not also amongst them some <HI>Amphibious Birds,</HI> as the <HI>Barnacle,</HI> which is neither Fish nor Fowle; and the cunning <HI>Batt,</HI> who sometimes professeth himselfe a <HI>Bird,</HI> sometimes a <HI>Mouse,</HI> I will not say there were any <HI>Paphlagonian Birds</HI> amongst them, who are knowne to have <HI>double</HI> hearts: But 'tis certaine that in this confusion there were some malevolent <HI>Birds,</HI> and many of them so young, that they were scarce <HI>sledg'd,</HI> who like the <HI>Waspe</HI> in the Fable, conspired to fire the <HI>Eagles</HI> nest; <HI>and a</HI> Waspe <HI>may sometimes doe mischiefe to an</HI> Eagle, <HI>as a</HI> Mouse <HI>to an</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="11"/> Elephant: Moreover, some of these high brained <HI>Birds</HI> flew so high that they seemed to arrogate to themselves, and exercise the royall power of the <HI>Eagle;</HI> but let them take heed, wee know what became of the <HI>Crow</HI> upon the <HI>Ram's</HI> backe, when she thought to imitate the <HI>Eagle:</HI> And it was observed, that they were most eager to attempt those high insolencis against <HI>Jove's Bird,</HI> who had been starke naked, and as bare as <HI>Cootes,</HI> unlesse he had feathered them; so that the little <HI>Ant</HI> was more gratefull to <HI>Esops Bire</HI> then those <HI>Birds</HI> were to the <HI>Eagle,</HI> their liege Lord. But the high-borne <HI>Bird</HI> with the two <HI>golden wings,</HI> the noble <HI>Faulcons,</HI> the <HI>Martlets,</HI> the <HI>Rovans,</HI> the <HI>Swan,</HI> the <HI>Chough,</HI> aed all the ancient <HI>Birds</HI> of the <HI>moun∣taines</HI> remained faithfull and firme to the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and scorned to be carried away by such <HI>Decoyes;</HI> As also the generous <HI>Ostriches,</HI> who unlesse they had had an extraordinary stomach, could not have digested such <HI>yron</HI> pills as were ofiered them.</P>
<P>The foresaid destractions continued still, and increased more and more in that generall convention of <HI>Birds;</HI> therefore the <HI>Turle</HI> would stay there no longer, there was so much <HI>gaull</HI> amongst them: the <HI>Pelican</HI> flew away, he saw <HI>piety</HI> so vilified; the <HI>Dove</HI> was weary of their company, she found no <HI>simplicity</HI> and plaine dealing amongst them: And the <HI>Kings-Fisher,</HI> the <HI>Halcyon,</HI> (the Embleme of <HI>Pies</HI>) quite forsooke them, hee found so much jarring dissentions and bandings on all sides; the <HI>Swallow</HI> also, who had so ancient and honorable a ranke amongst them, got into another ayre, he fore-saw the weather was like to be so foule: And lastly, <HI>Philomela,</HI> the Queen of <HI>Volatills,</HI> who was partner of the <HI>Eagle's</HI> nest, abandoned them quite, and put a Sea 'twixt her and them; nay, the <HI>Eagle</HI> himselfe withdrew his royall presence from them; so the <HI>Decoyes</HI> afore-said car∣ried all before them, and compoted themselves by their <HI>Orders</HI> in that highth, as if like the <HI>Lapwing,</HI> every one had a <HI>Crowne</HI> on his head; they so enchanted in a manner, all the common sort of the <HI>Oppidan rurall,</HI> and <HI>Sea-birds,</HI> and infused such a credulity into them, that they believed they had an inerring spirit, and what came from them, was as true as the <HI>Pentuteuch:</HI> Moreover, it was shrewdly suspected, that there was a plot amongst them to let in the <HI>Storke,</HI> who is never seen to stay long in any <HI>Monarchie.</HI></P></Q>

<P>Sir, by this <HI>Ornilogicall Apologue,</HI> you have not onely confirmed, but also enriched, and much enlarged my under∣standing in the knowledge of things. Good Lord, how pitifully were those pore Prelates handled; what a <HI>Tartarian</HI> kind of
<PB N="18" REF="12"/> tyrannie it was, to drag twice into prison twelve grave reverend Bishops in that manner, <HI>causâ adhuc inaudita,</HI> and afterwards afterwards not to be able to frame as much as an accusation of <HI>misdemeanor,</HI> against them, much lesse of <HI>Treason,</HI> whereof they were first impeach'd with such high clamors: But I conceive it was of purpose, to set them out of the way, that the new <HI>Facti∣on</HI> might passe things better amongst the <HI>Peers.</HI> And it seemes they brought their worke about; for whilest nhey were thus <HI>reclused</HI> and absent, they were thrust out of doores, and <HI>ejected</HI> out of their owne proper ancient inheritance, as it were. But would not all this, with those unparalell'd <HI>Bills</HI> of Grace you mentioned in your first <HI>Discourse,</HI> which had formerly passed, suffice to beget a good understanding, and make them <HI>confide</HI> in their King?</P>

<SPEAKER>Patr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but the passing of these <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> were term'd <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Duty</HI> in his Majesty; they wet so far, that 'twas not sufficient for him to give up his <HI>Tower,</HI> his <HI>Fleet-Royall,</HI> his <HI>Magazines,</HI> his <HI>Porte,</HI> and <HI>Castles</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> but he must de∣liver up his <HI>Sword</HI> into their hands, all the <HI>Souldiery</HI> and <HI>Mili∣tary</HI> forces of the Land; nay, he must give up his very <HI>Vnder∣standing</HI> unto them; he must resigne his owne <HI>Reason,</HI> and with an <HI>implicit Faith</HI> and <HI>blind Obedience,</HI> he must believe, who they did, <HI>was to make him glorious;</HI> and if at any time he taxed them, or prescribed wayes for them to proceed and expedite matters, or if he advised them in any thing, they tooke it in a kind of in∣dignation, and 'twas presently cryed up to be <HI>Breach of Pri∣viledge.</HI></P>

<P>There is no way in my conceit, to make a King more inglorious, both at home and abroad, then to disarme him; and to take from him the command and disposing of the <HI>Mili∣tia</HI> throughout his Kingdome, is directly to disarme him, and wrest thē <HI>Sword</HI> out of his hand: and how then can he be term'd <HI>A Defenders</HI> how cand hee defend either himselfe, or others? tis the onely way to expose him to scorne and derision; truely,

<P>Because I find your <HI>Genius</HI> to be delighted with <HI>Apo∣logues,</HI> I will goe on to illustrate this point unto you that way, I began with the <HI>Heavens,</HI> I then descended to the lower <HI>Region</HI> of the <HI>Ayre;</HI> and now I will bring you to the <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Upon a time, The <HI>Flowers</HI> assembled, and met in one generall Counsell, by the authority and summons of the Soveraigne <HI>Rose,</HI> their undoubted naturall King, who had taken the <HI>Lilly</HI> for his royall spouse. The dew of Heaven fell plentifully upon this happy conjunction. which made them to <HI>Bourgeon,</HI> to propagate any prosper exceedingly, in so much, that the sweet fragrant <HI>odor</HI> which they did cast, diffused it selfe over all the earth. To this meeting came the <HI>Violet,</HI> the <HI>Gilliflower, Rosemary,</HI> the <HI>Tulyp, Lavander</HI> and <HI>Thyme,</HI> the <HI>Cinquefoyle</HI> (though of an <HI>exotique</HI> planta∣tion,) had an honourable ranke amongst them; and as some observed, got too much credit with the royall <HI>Rose.</HI> The <HI>Flowers</HI> of the <HI>field</HI> were ad∣mitted also to the great Counsell: the <HI>Couslip,</HI> the <HI>Honysuckle</HI> and <HI>Daisie</HI> had their Delegates there present, to consult of a Reformation of certaine abuses which had taken <HI>rooting</HI> in the Common-weales of <HI>Flowers,</HI> and being all under the <HI>Rose,</HI> they had priviledge to speake of all things with freedome; complaints were made, that much <HI>Cockle Melampod</HI> and <HI>Dar∣nel,</HI> with other noxious <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Tares</HI> were crept in amongst them; that the <HI>Poppie</HI> did <HI>pullulat</HI> too much with divers other grievances: The successe of this Senat, this great <HI>Bed</HI> or <HI>Posie</HI> of living <HI>Flowers,</HI> was like to prove very prosperous, but that the <HI>herb Briony, Wormwood, Wolfe∣bane, Rue,</HI> and <HI>Hemlocke,</HI> (the emblemes of <HI>Sedition, Malice, Feare, Anbition</HI> and <HI>Jealousie</HI>) thrust in amongst them, and much distempered their proceedings: These brought in with them the <HI>Bur,</HI> which exceeding∣ly retarded and intangled all businesses; and it was thought that the <HI>Thistle</HI> was too meddling amongst them, which made matters grow to that acrimony and confusion, as if the <HI>herb Morsus diaboli</HI> had got in amongst them. Amongst many other good-morrowes, they propounded to the <HI>Rose,</HI> that he should part with his <HI>prickles,</HI> and transmit his strength that way to be disposed of by them; the <HI>Rose</HI> liked not this bold request of theirs, though couched in very smooth language, but answered, I have hitherto condesended to every thing you have propounded, much more then any of
<PB N="20" REF="13"/> my Predecessors did; but touching these <HI>prickles,</HI> which God and nature hath given mee, and are inherent in mee and my stocke from the begin∣ing, though they be but excressencies, yet you know they fortifie and arme me, <HI>Armat Spina Rosam,</HI> And by them I protect you and your <HI>rights</HI> from violence; and what protection I pray can there be without strength? therefore I will by no meanes part with them to enfeeble my regall Power, but will retaine them still, and bequeanh them to my Posterity, which I would be loth to betray in this point; nor doe I much value what that silly <HI>infected</HI> Animal, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Bees</HI> tells mee sometimes, when humming up and downe my leaves, he would buzze this fond beliefe into mee, that it added much to his Majesty that nature gives him no <HI>sting</HI> as all other <HI>Bees</HI> have, because hee should rely altogether upon the love and loyalty of his subjects. No, I will take warning by the <HI>Eagle,</HI> the King of <HI>Volatills,</HI> and by the <HI>Lyon,</HI> King of <HI>Quadrupedals,</HI> who (as the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Mora∣lists</HI> report) when by faire insinuations the one had parted with his <HI>tallons,</HI> the other with his <HI>teeth</HI> tnd <HI>engles,</HI> wherein their might, and consequent∣ly their Majesty consisted, grew afterwards contemptible to all creatures, and qute lost that naturall alleigeance and awe which was due unto mee, the one from all <HI>Birds,</HI> and to the other, from all <HI>Beasts</HI> of <HI>Field</HI> and <HI>Forest.</HI></P></Q>

<P>They cry'd out that the Kingdome was upon point of being ruin'd; that it was in the very jawes of destruction; that there were forreigne and inland plots against it: all which are prov'd long since to be nothing else but meere <HI>Chymera's;</HI> yet people for the most part, continue still grossely besotted, that they cannot perceive to this day, that these forg'd feares, these <HI>Vtopian</HI> plots, those publike <HI>Idea's</HI> were fram'd of purpose, that they might take all the martiall power into their hands; that so they might without controlement cast the government of Church and state into what mold they pleased, and ingrosse the chiefest offices to themselves: And from these imaginary in∣visible dangers proceeded these visible calamities, and grinding
<PB N="21" REF="13"/> palpable pressures which hath accompanied this odius warre ever since.</P>

<P>Herein me thinks, your <HI>Stastis</HI> have shewne them∣selves politique enough, but not so prudent; for <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Policy,</HI> though they often agree in the <HI>end,</HI> yet they differ in election of the <HI>meanes</HI> to compasse their ends: The one serves himselfe of truth, strength of Reason, and integrity, and gallant∣nesse in their proceedings; the oteer of fictions, fraudulence, lies, and other sinister meanes; the worke of one is lasting and permanent, the other worke moulders away, and end in infamy; for <HI>fraud</HI> and <HI>frost</HI> alwayes end <HI>foule.</HI> But how did they requite that most rare and high unexampled trust his Majesty reposed in them when he before passed that <HI>(totall)</HI> Act of continuance, a greater trust then ever <HI>English</HI> put in Parliament. How did they performe their solemde promise and deepe Protestations, to make him the most <HI>glorious</HI> (at home and abroad) the <HI>richest</HI> and <HI>best belovedst</HI> King that ever raigned in that <HI>Island.</HI></P>

<P>Herein I must confesse, I they held very ill correspon∣dence with him; for the more hee trusted them, the more dif∣fident they grew of him; and truly, Sir, herein white differs not so much from blacke, as their actions have been disconso∣nant to their words: Touching the first promise, to make him <HI>glorius;</HI> if to suffer a neighboring <HI>Nation</HI> to demand and ob∣taine what they pleased of him; if to breake capitulation of peace with a great forreigne <HI>Prince</HI> by the <HI>renvoy</HI> of the <HI>Capu∣chins,</HI> and divers other Acts; if to bring the dregs and riffraffe of the City to domindere before his Court gato, notwithstan∣ding his Proclamations; if to confront him and seeke his life by fire and sword in open field, by open defiance, and putting him upon a defensive warre; if to vote his Queen a <HI>Traytresse,</HI> to shoot at her, to way-lay her to destroy her, if to hinder the reading of his Proclamations, and the sleight in of his Decla∣rations enclosed in Letters, sign'd and seal'd with his owne hand, for feare they should bring the people to their wits againe; if
<PB N="22" REF="14"/> to call them <HI>fetters of gold, divellish devices, fraught with doctrines of division, reall mistakes, absurd suppositions,</HI> though never dropt from <HI>Princes</HI> pen, more full, more rationall and strong <HI>sinewy</HI> expressions; if to suffer every shallow brain'd <HI>Scoolist</HI> to <HI>preach,</HI> every <HI>Pamphletter</HI> to <HI>print;</HI> every rotten hearted man or woman to <HI>prate</HI> what they please of him and his Queen; if to sleight his often acknowledgement, condissentions, retractations, pronun∣tiations of Peace, and proffers of Pardon; if to endeavour to bring him to a kind of submission; if to bar him of the atten∣dance of <HI>Domestiques,</HI> to abuse and imprison his messengers, to hang his servants for obeying his Commission; if to preferre the safety and repute of five ordinary men, before his honoue; and being actually <HI>impeach'd</HI> of Treason, to bring them in a kind of triumph to his House; if for subjects to <HI>Article, Treat</HI> and <HI>Capitulate</HI> hith him; if to tamper with his <HI>Conscience,</HI> and make him forget the solemne sacramentall oath at his <HI>Coronati∣on;</HI> if to devest him of all regall rights, to take from him the election of his servants and officers, and bring him backe to a kind of minority; if this be to make a King <HI>glorious,</HI> our King is made glorious enough. Touching the second promise to make him the <HI>richest</HI> King that ever was; if to denude him of his native rights, to declare that hee hath no property in any thing but by way of trust, not so much property as an <HI>Elect</HI> King; if to take away his customes of his inheritance; if to take from his Exchequer and Mint; if to thrust him out of his owne townes, to suffer a lowsie Citizen to lie in his beds with∣in his royall Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> when hee himselfe would have come thither to lodge; if to enforce him to a defensive warre, and cause him to engage his Jewells and Plate, and plunge him a bottomelesse gulph of debt for his necessary defence; if to an∣ticipate his revenue royall, and reduce him to such exigents that he hath scarce the subsistence of an ordinary Gentleman; if this be make a <HI>rich</HI> King, then is our King made sufficiently rich. Concerning their third promise, to make him the <HI>best be∣lovedst</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/> King that ever was; if to call all the aspersions that pos¦sibly could be devised upon his government by publique elabo∣rate remonstrances; if to suffer and give Texts to the strongest lung'd <HI>Pulpiteers</HI> to poyson the hearts of his subjects, to intoxi∣cate their braines with fumes of forg'd jealousies, to possesse them with an opinion, that he is a Papist in his heart and con∣sequently hath a designe to introduce Popery; if to sleight his words his promises; if to his Asseverations, Oaths and Pro∣testations, when he calls heaven and earth to witnesse, when he desires no blessing otherwise to fall upon himselfe, his wife and children, with other pathetick deep-fetcht expressions, that would have made the meanest of those millions of Christians which are his vessals to be believed; if to protect Delinquants, and proclaim'd Traytors against him; if to <HI>suscitate, authorise,</HI> and <HI>encourage</HI> all sorts of subjects to heave up their hands against, and levie armes to <HI>emancipate</HI> themselves from that na∣turall allegeance, loyalty, and subjection, wherein, they and their fore-fathers were ever tied to his royall Progenitors; if to make them sweare and damne themselves into a rebellion; if this be to make a King <HI>beloved,</HI> then this <HI>Parliament</HI> hath made King <HI>Charles</HI> the best <HI>belovedst</HI> King that ever was in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>I cannot compare this Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> more properly then to that in this Kingdome; in King <HI>Iohn's</HI> time, which in our <HI>French Cronicle,</HI> beares to this day the infamous name of <HI>Iaqerie de Beauvoisin;</HI> Then <HI>Peasans</HI> then out of a sur∣fet of plenty, had growne up to that heighth of insolenco, that they confronted the <HI>Gentcie,</HI> and gathered in multitudes, and put themselves in armes to suppresse them; and this popular tumult never ceased till <HI>Charles le Sage</HI> suppressed it; and it made the Kings of <HI>France</HI> more puissant ever since: for it much increased their <HI>Finances,</HI> in regard that these extraordinary taxes which the people imposed upon themselves for the sup∣port of the war, hath continued ever since a firme revenue to the Crowne; which makes me thinke of a fractious speech of
<PB N="24" REF="15"/> the late <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, to them of <HI>Orleans:</HI> for whereas a new imposition was laid upon them, during the <HI>league</HI> by <HI>Monseur de la Chastre,</HI> who was a great stickler in those wars, they petiti∣oned <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, that he would be pleased to take of that taxe, the King asked them, Who had laid that taxe upon them? they said <HI>Mons. de la Castres,</HI> during the time of the <HI>League,</HI> the King replyed, <HI>Puis que Monsieur de la Chatre vous à ligue qu'il vous dessligue;</HI> and so the said taxe continueth to this day.</P>
<P>I have observed in your Cronicles that it hath been the fate of your Kings to be baffled often by petty companions; as <HI>Iack Stpawe, Wat Tyler, Cade, Warbecke</HI> and <HI>Symnel.</HI> A <HI>Waspe</HI> may sometimes doe a shrew turne to the <HI>Eagle,</HI> as you said be∣fore; your <HI>Island</HI> hath been fruitfull for Rebellions, for I thinke there hapned neere upon a <HI>hundred</HI> since the last Conquest, the City of <HI>London,</HI> as I remember, in your Storie hath rebelled seven times at least, and forfeited her Charter I know not how often, but she bled soundly for it at last, and commonly the better your <HI>Princes,</HI> tre worse your <HI>people</HI> have been, or the case stands, I see no way for the King to establish a setled peace, the by making a fifth <HI>Conquest</HI> of you: and for <HI>London,</HI> there must be a way found to prick that tympany of pride wherewith the swells.</P>

<P>'Tis true, there hath been from time to time many odde Insurrections in <HI>England,</HI> but our Kings gathered a greater strength out of them, the <HI>inconstant people are alwayes accessary to their miseries:</HI> Kings Prerogatives are like the Ocean, which as the Civilians tell us, if he lose in one place, he gets in ano∣ther. Care and Crosse ride behind Kings, and the same they say, may be eclypsed awhile, but they will shine afterwards with a stronger lustre. Our gracious Soveraigne hath these three or foure yeeres passed a kind of <HI>Ordeal</HI> or fiery triall; hee hath been <HI>matriculated</HI> and serv'd halfe an Appretiship in the Schoole of Affliction; I hope God will please shortly to can∣cell the Indenture, and restore him to a sweeter liberty then</P>
