<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF THE Proceedings of 13 Kings, Princes, and Dukes, touching the present state and condition of the King of Scots; and their Royal Edict and Summons sent to all Christendom.</HEAD>
<P>THere hath been a great and imperial Coun∣cel held at Munster in Germany, by the Am∣bassadors of 13 Christian Kings, Princes, and Dukes; At which Diet, they took into considera∣tion the present state and condition of many exiled Princes; and amongst the rest, a Conference arose touching the King of Scots; but nothing done therein (at present) by reason of other weighty and
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>emergent businesses, which call them to a Work of far greater concernment; and may also prove fatal, if not timely prevented: For the Great Turk, and his Bashaw have taken the field with seven hundred thousand Horse and Foot, and are resolved (if possi∣ble) to make a great devastation and inroad upon Christendom this Summer: But great is the care of the Emperour of Germany, the 7 Christian Princes of Italy, the Queen of Sweden, the Prince of Tran∣silvania, and Prince Frederick of Malta, to raise a formidable Power, and to unite and joyn with the Venetians, both in an offensive and defensive War against the Turks; And in pursuance thereof, a League is concluding between the aforesaid Prin∣ces; who have had a large consultation thereupon; But that which is thought most requisite and feasi∣ble at present, is, the sending of a Summons to all Christendom, for Warlike Provisions to be made a∣gainst the Enemies thereof; And indeed great rea∣son have they so to do; for never was a more po∣tent and irresistable Army raised these many years, as now the Turks and Janisaries have raised. Yet notwithstanding, Prince Philip (the third Son to the Queen of Bohemia, and General to the Stases of Ve∣nice) hath given them a great Overthrow neer the Isle of Candia, and kill'd, taken, and routed about threescore thousand men: This Overthrow doth
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>exceedingly retard the Enemies Design; and as it is a great prejudice to them, so it is a great advantage to Christendom; And his Highnesse Prince Philip hath embraced this opportunity; who by the assist∣ance of the Divine Power, hath obtained another great Victory against the Janisaries: Since which Atchievements, he is called Philip the Great; a Gen∣tleman of a gallant temper, and endow'd with ex∣cellent Properties and Vertues, both for prudence, wisdom, and magnanimity of Spirit: He is even be∣come as great a Terrour to the Turks, as Alexander the Great was to the Christians.</P>
<P>The King of Scots hath sent the Lord Wilmot with a Message to the Princes of Italy, imploring Supplies and Accommodation, suitable to his pre∣sent Necessities and Condition; but, they have re∣turned Answer, That by reason of the home-bred divisions, and forreign Preparations of the Enemy in severall parts against the Christian Territories, they could not answer his expectation at present, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Duke of Malta hath declared, that he will give his Royal Assent to the Union; and that he will raise forty thousand Horfe and Foot, to joyn with the Christians against the Turks; and in pursuance thereof hath granted a Commission to Prince Fre∣derick, Landgrave of Hesse, to command in chief un∣der his Highness Prince Philips.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P> By an Express from Amsterdam it is certified, that the General Assembly of the United Provinces met at the Hague, where there was a large Debate touching the proclaiming of open Wars with Eng∣land, otherwise to have restitution and satisfaction for all their ships and Goods taken: But after ma∣ture deliberation touching the apparent dangers that might thereby ensue, the States of Holland gave in their positive Result, declaring, That they were resolved (to the utmost of their power) to preserve a firm League and Union with, the States of Eng∣land; and to hold a fair correspondency for the in∣crease of free Trade and Commerce: Whereupon the States and Merchants of Zealand rose up in great fury, dissolved the Assembly, and vowed re∣venge upon the English; but its thought the States General will be more prudent and wise then to hearken to the cryes or gruntling of the Bores; for here is a Proverb, That the Cries of the Geese are never heard up to Heaven.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, the spirits of many thou∣sands are much exasperated, and great are the prepa∣rations which are making throughout the United Provinces; The Merchants of Zealand have sent 40 Commissioners to the States General, to treat and two hundred ships with Letters of Mart; so that
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>they are again fat down in Councel, and its concei∣ved that at this Meeting, it will be resolved, to man out about 150 Men of War at the publike charge, besides what will be set forth by the Merchants, and Others, upon Letters of Mart, which (if things hold at this pass) our Governors that are well-affected to England, will be in evident danger of utter ruine.</P>
<P>For great are the Contests between the Burgo∣masters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to sequester their Estates, and bring them to a Tryall for their lives, if they will not take a course to defend and assist them at Sea. And some Tumults and Ri∣sings have already been in Zealand, Rotterdam, Dort, Delf, and at the Hague, where many were both slain and wounded, and amongst the rest fome English, which the Mutiniers chiefly aymed at, and brand them with the most infamous Badge of Tray∣tors and Conspirators to their Religion and Liber∣ties; which they are yet to chuse. And upon this Score, divers English Merchants are prohibited from coming upon the Exchange in Amsterdam, and o∣ther places. 200 Commissioners have bin sent to all the Frontier and Haven Towns, to see how many ships each Town can make ready in three weekes time: And having taken a List thereof, upon their return, caused the same to be printed; wherein ap∣pears the similitude of a great Armado, consisting of
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>about 300 sayl of ships, Danes, Dutch, and Ham∣burgers: Besides they talk of 200 more to be set forth upon Letters of Mart; but the truth is; they'l talk more by an inch of Candle in their liquor by Land, then they can perform by a whole pound, when they are in their Element at Sea. And although they build Castles in the Ayr, make their Accounts in Spain, and resolve to cast them up in England, by blocking up Dover, Sandwitch, Deal, and other Ports.</P>
<P>And the truth is, the English are become odious in those parts, and dare not walk the streets without great hazard to their per∣sons: But sure it is, That these Times will not last alwayes.</P>
