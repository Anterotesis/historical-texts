<HEAD><HI>THE COPIE</HI> OF A LETTER <HI>FROM</HI> A Commander in the <HI>FLEET</HI> with HIS HIGHNESSE the <HI>Prince of WALES. September</HI> the 7. 1648.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>E pleased to receive this narrative of the latest Occurrents from the <HI>Fleet</HI> with His Highnesse the <HI>Prince of</HI> WALES: His Highnesse landed at <HI>Helford-sluce</HI> the last Saturday, and on Munday night was received according to His quality at the <HI>Hague:</HI> The cause of His return so soon from Sea, was a generall want of Victuals of all sorts in the <HI>Fleet.</HI> The Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> avoided two whole daies to <HI>fight</HI> with His Highnesse; which had he had either wil or courage to do,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> he might have done it at pleasure, the <HI>Prince</HI> having no means (the other being continually in the wind of Him) to avoid it; and the last of those two daies the <HI>Prince</HI> got so neer him, that both <HI>Fleets</HI> had been engaged, had not God in that instant of time, sent so sudden and vio∣lent a storme, as the like for the manner hath not been heard of, so that both <HI>Fleets</HI> were forced to take in their <HI>sailes,</HI> and come unto an <HI>Anchor:</HI> The Earle of <HI>War∣wicke</HI> went afterwarwards into the entrance of the River of <HI>Chatham:</HI> His Highnesse the next day advanced, but finding the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> had no mind to engage without a very great advantage, which was offered him among the <HI>Sands:</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> next morning being Fri∣day, set saile, and with▪ as little sayle as possible he could, stood unto the Eastward, hoping to have drawne the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> from the <HI>Sands</HI> unto the open Sea: <HI>Warwicke</HI> being swolne to above <HI>thirty Sayle,</HI> by reason of all outward-bound Ships came in to him, set sayle likewise; but he first saw the <HI>Prince</HI> some three Leagues at least luward of him, the wind then at West. South∣west, and South-west, he following with the same sayle the Prince still made, and when His Highnesse lessened sayle, he lessened, and when His Highnesse lay by the lee, he did the like, keeping alwaies the same distance untill betwixt three or foure a Clock afternoon, and then fell from Him, and came unto an Anchor, 3 or 4 Leagues in the wind of the PRINCE's <HI>Fleet.</HI> Certainly <HI>Warwick</HI> had all the reason in the world to have engaged in Fight, considering all advantages were on his side, both of place and wind, and the prize for which he fought; whereas the <HI>Prince</HI> (all things well considered) had no reason at all, but His high courage drew Him thereunto, for when the Lords, the Officers, and whole company of the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> Ship, had humbly on their knees desired Him to betake Himself unto a place of some security for His Person, and enforced the same by many strong reasons and per∣swasions: He onely replied, <HI>What doth this concerne mine Honour?</HI> and taking a scrued Gun in His hand, <HI>I am confident with this Piece this day to shoot</HI> Warwicke <HI>through the head, if he dares in Person appeare in the Fight:</HI> and so by His example, put a most invincible courage into the hearts of all His People. The <HI>Prince</HI> had a fair opportunity to make Himself master of <HI>Ports∣mouth Fleet,</HI> and that without blows; for His Highnesse Ship made them before night, and knew them to be the same, and the tyde of ebbe being come, they could not turne it up, the wind West-south-west, but were forced to come to an Anchor, His Highnesse passed through them, onely giving notice to a catch to awaken one or two of them▪ and command them to follow the Lord <HI>Warwicke,</HI> the <HI>Fleet</HI> being put to luward of them, and a strong tyde of ebbe bent, it was not possible again to re∣cover them, but the reer Admirall came in up the sterne most Ship: finding them (notwithstanding their for∣mer summons) asleep, awakened them with two or three shot. The <HI>Prince</HI> at His comming from the <HI>Downes,</HI> which was Saturday the 26 of <HI>August,</HI> had another designe then comming up the River, out of a hot desire the Sea-men had to fight with <HI>Warwicke,</HI> and I am con∣fident, they would have spent themselves unto the last man against him, such was their violent earnestnesse to fight with him.</P>
<P>The businesse of force in Shipping, was I suppose e∣quall on both sides, there being not four peeces of Ord∣nance difference, the <HI>Prince</HI> had 17 Sayle, 11 onely bea∣ring Ordnance, the rest were Hoyes, Carches, and prize-Vessels
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> unarmed. <HI>Warwicke</HI> at first but 13. 11 whereof were wel-fitted, the other two Catches, but in courage and brave resolution of people His Highnesse far excee∣ded him.</P>
<P>Surely never did an higher courage, and more gallan∣try of resolution appeare in man then, did in His Highnesse, whose great affability with His People, His readinesse and clearnesse of judgment, and His excee∣ding confidence in all appearing difficulties, prove Him of a most Martiall constitution, and give us visible, and infallible assurances, that with Gods blessing, He will prove with a little experience one of the most able Com∣manders both by Sea and Land, now in Christendome: and in Military prowesse will equall the most warlike Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nces that ever this Nation bred.</P>
