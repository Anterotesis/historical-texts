<HEAD>A true Relation of certaine Ships which were driven into St <HI>Jves</HI> in <HI>Corn-wall,</HI> and into <HI>Dortmouth,</HI> by reason of Tempestuous Weather.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>PON Sabbath day last in the morning being the 13. of <HI>Februa∣ry</HI> 1641. one Captaine <HI>Basset</HI> came to <HI>London</HI> from the <HI>West</HI> Parts of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and now lodgeth at the Signe of the <HI>Swann</HI> in the Strand, who brought certaine intelli∣gence of two Ships which were driven into a <HI>Harbour,</HI> by reason of the Tempestu∣ousnesse of the Weather, and now lyeth at St. <HI>Jves,</HI> which Ships came from <HI>Bilbo</HI> in <HI>Spaine,</HI> being bound for <HI>Jreland</HI> to assist the Bloud-sucking Rebells there, against his Majesties Subjects; which Rebells dayly increase more and more, and if speedy reliefe comes not to those who yet are not overcome, the whole Kingdome is like to be lost.</P>
<P>Now these two Ships when they were driven into St. <HI>Ives,</HI> some of the men which were on bourd came on Land, to view the place where they were cast in∣to, and as they say to buy food for themselves.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P>There was a man who lived in that <HI>Harbour,</HI> being witty, he made as if he had bin a Justice of Peace whereupon he examined them, what and who they were; and from whence they came, and whither they were going, this man not liking their answer, ten∣dred unto them the Oath of Allegiance, the which they tooke, he seeing that he could not finde them out what they were by that meanes, then he tendred unto them the Oath of Supremacy the which they refused to take, whereupon he suspected what they were, and therefore made those acquainted with it which had authority, and so caused them to be layd hold on and apprehended, which when they were layd fast, then they went with a great number toge∣ther to the Ships and searched them, wherein they found a-Bourd greate store of Iron, six and twenty Tunn of Wheate, &amp; eighteene Hoggs-heads of Wine. There was also found six Fryers, and aboundance of Priests and Iesuites, together with many others of their faction.</P>
<P>There was likewise found on bourd in the same Ships many <HI>Crucifixes, Beads,</HI> and certaine mens <HI>Teeth,</HI> which the <HI>Priests</HI> told were some of St. <HI>Peters Teeth.</HI> There was likewise found a little water in a very small Vessell, which the <HI>Priests</HI> say is <HI>Mary Magda∣lens</HI> Teares, there was likewise found a piece of <HI>Wood</HI> which they say was a piece of the <HI>Crosse</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> was Crucified upon. This more especially they tooke with them that so by that meanes they may be pro∣tected with safety to their Ionrneys end, now how Treacherously their God whom they trusted in) hath dealt with them: all men may judge by the effects, for they are all in Prison in St. <HI>Ives</HI> untill the plea∣sure
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>of the Parliament be knowne concerning them.</P>
<P>Besides there was found in those two Ships very many Letters, which now are brought to the <HI>Parlia∣ment:</HI> the contents whereof are not yet published.</P>
<P>There is also certaine intelligence brought over of three other Ships which is in <HI>Dunkirk</HI> very full of Ammunition and men bound for <HI>Jreland,</HI> the names of the Ships are these.</P>

<P>The truth of this is verifyed in a Message from a Committee of both Houses, to the <HI>Spanish Ambassa∣dor.</HI></P>
